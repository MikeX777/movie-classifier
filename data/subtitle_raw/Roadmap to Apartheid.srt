1
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:33,890
This is the beautiful land
of Israel and Palestine.

2
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:39,488
The world’s three
most prominent religions

3
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:44,839
Islam, Christianity and
Judaism, consider it holy land.

4
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:55,834
Each year, millions of
people from around the world

5
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:59,485
Come here to pray for
peace and prosperity.

6
00:01:02,384 --> 00:01:05,462
Yet this land is
also a major center

7
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,968
of conflict in the world today.

8
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:11,007
(gunshots)

9
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,617
For Jewish Israelis,
the conflict

10
00:01:16,637 --> 00:01:18,508
centers on protecting a homeland

11
00:01:18,508 --> 00:01:22,210
Created for the Jewish
people in 1948.

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,872
For Palestinians, it is about

13
00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:31,398
resisting decades
of colonialism,

14
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:44,811
expulsion, occupation,
and apartheid.

15
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,461
(music)

16
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,419
Most people identify
apartheid with the

17
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,062
grotesque system of
control that existed

18
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:03,167
in South Africa
from 1948 to 1994,

19
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:05,687
in which the white minority

20
00:02:05,687 --> 00:02:09,426
ruled over the black
majority, stole their

21
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:13,031
land, and deprived
them of basic rights.

22
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,626
It was a system reviled
by the whole world,

23
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:18,897
and it eventually
crumbled under the

24
00:02:18,897 --> 00:02:20,816
combined pressure of internal

25
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:23,577
resistance and
international sanctions.

26
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,656
Today the word is
back, and with it too

27
00:02:27,676 --> 00:02:30,552
is a growing global
movement to end the

28
00:02:30,552 --> 00:02:34,094
Israeli form of apartheid.

29
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:42,023
(music)

30
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,932
(music)

31
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:51,287
(music fades out)

32
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:59,290
Time, October, 1948.
A new leadership.

33
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:01,865
It denies the morality
of economic free

34
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:04,912
for all. Its slogan:
“To each his own.”

35
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,447
Its belief: parallel
development,

36
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:09,471
separate identity. Apartheid.

37
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:11,769
The word Apartheid,
is an Afrikaans word,

38
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,593
Which simply means separateness,
Being apart.

39
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:19,013
So we had the wonderful
term called separate

40
00:04:19,054 --> 00:04:21,792
development, but it was
never intended to be equal.

41
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:24,912
One could talk about the
petty Apartheid. That

42
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:27,721
was about the fact
that almost from birth

43
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:31,048
your life was separated
from people of other races.

44
00:04:31,048 --> 00:04:33,311
You’d have to stand
if the bus was

45
00:04:33,331 --> 00:04:35,419
full. If you went to the beach,

46
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:37,641
there were some beaches
you could not walk on.

47
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:40,802
Those were the sorts of petty
manifestations.

48
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:44,485
But you had the real Apartheid,
which for me was about

49
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:48,601
the structural systems and
policies of Apartheid,

50
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,757
the way in which land was
taken away from people.

51
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:55,788
In the first post-war
election, the

52
00:04:55,808 --> 00:04:57,879
white electorate
voted into power

53
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,288
a group of men dedicated
to the complete

54
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:02,736
separation of the races
in South Africa.

55
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:07,121
The vision was to
create a demographic

56
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:11,289
white majority, at
least of citizens,

57
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:15,048
even though you were going to
have the others in your midst.

58
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:18,542
The entire nationalistic
existence was

59
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:21,608
at stake. It was
going to be swamped

60
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:24,328
by the black majority, so they

61
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:27,368
evolved the concept
of Apartheid.

62
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:31,327
Ultimately the driving
force behind it all

63
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:34,626
was to create the
white Afrikaner-led

64
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:38,155
nation so that Afrikanerdom
could sustain its

65
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,086
permanent existence
as a national entity.

66
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:47,607
Now united, the folk would
decide South Africa’s destiny.

67
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:50,633
The years of division,
of second-class citizenship,

68
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:53,028
had conditioned
Afrikaners to thinking

69
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:55,120
of themselves as a
people besieged.

70
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:58,988
Afrikaner history formed a sort

71
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:02,297
of self-contained
moral universe.

72
00:06:02,338 --> 00:06:04,985
Whereas the rest of
the world saw them as

73
00:06:05,026 --> 00:06:07,681
oppressors, as
colonizers, as racists,

74
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:12,057
they saw themselves primarily
as victims, settlers

75
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:16,000
who were escaping religious
persecution in Europe.

76
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,933
They saw themselves as fighting
for self-determination.

77
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:24,843
In 1836, in an
extraordinary gesture

78
00:06:24,863 --> 00:06:26,894
of self-reliance and courage,

79
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:29,647
2,000 Afrikaners crossed
the Orange River into the

80
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:32,276
wilderness, out of the
bondage of British rule.

81
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:38,500
The first time in
history that the

82
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,933
term concentration camp appears,

83
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:44,446
is in Afrikaner history.
About 10% of the

84
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:48,258
population died in British
concentration camps.

85
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:52,844
So for them, Apartheid
was about survival,

86
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:57,274
about self-determination,
about redemption,

87
00:06:57,524 --> 00:07:00,771
about preserving a way of life.
You see

88
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,422
a very similar
pattern in Zionism.

89
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:07,030
Despite that Palestinians
experienced it as

90
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,373
a very aggressive
colonizing movement that

91
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:13,918
has dispossessed them
Israelis are capable of

92
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:17,271
seeing themselves as
victims, as survivors

93
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,032
of drawing on Jewish history in

94
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:23,141
order to justify
their status quo.

95
00:07:23,182 --> 00:07:25,653
It’s important to address that.
It’s

96
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:28,319
important to address
them with empathy

97
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:31,979
and to say, “I don’t
accept what you do,

98
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:35,430
but I understand what
the motivation is”,

99
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:38,056
and to be able to
talk about that.

100
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:50,510
(ambient sounds)

101
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:58,760
We feel that the
concept of Apartheid

102
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:01,152
is really crucial
for understanding

103
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:03,770
what’s happening here,
and where Israel

104
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,230
is going, because
it’s the only term

105
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,639
that accurately
defines the system

106
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,111
that Israel is
trying to develop.

107
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:15,964
It isn’t just a policy. It’s
not just discrimination.

108
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:18,537
It’s the way the
system is structured.

109
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:21,331
It’s separation of
populations in which one

110
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:23,910
group permanently and
institutionatally

111
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,603
dominates another group.

112
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:27,818
It’s getting to the
point where there

113
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:29,301
isn’t going to be a
Jewish majority.

114
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,853
If you take the
entirety of Israel and

115
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:33,930
the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip,

116
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:37,016
we’re at the point now where
it’s roughly 50/50.

117
00:08:37,126 --> 00:08:40,847
And that’s before any
Palestinian refugees return.

118
00:08:46,446 --> 00:08:49,351
Palestinians are
broadly categorized

119
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:51,079
into three main groups.

120
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:53,824
The majority of
Palestinians are refugees

121
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:56,305
who were forced out of
the land that became

122
00:08:56,305 --> 00:09:00,657
Israel in 1948. Today
they number over 6

123
00:09:00,698 --> 00:09:03,609
million people and still
live in refugee camps

124
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,782
in places like Syria,
Lebanon, and Jordan.

125
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:12,989
A second group are
the Palestinians

126
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:15,211
who managed to
stay inside Israel

127
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:19,514
during the 1948 war and became
Israeli citizens.

128
00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:26,202
And lastly, there are the
5 million Palestinians

129
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:28,839
living in the
occupied territories:

130
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,055
the West Bank, East Jerusalem,
and the Gaza Strip.

131
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:37,712
This territory is defined by
what is known as the green line.

132
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:42,915
This is land that
Israel occupied in the

133
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:46,554
1967 war, and still
controls to this day.

134
00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:51,063
Palestinians in these
areas do not have Israeli

135
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:54,969
citizenship, nor do they
have a state of their own.

136
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:07,049
(children shouting)

137
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:19,123
What you have in the West
Bank is two entirely

138
00:10:19,164 --> 00:10:22,298
separate and unequal
geographies that are

139
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:27,359
super-imposed on each other,
but exist separately.

140
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:31,629
You have the Palestinians
who are cut off

141
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:35,920
into dozens of ghettos,
literally surrounded

142
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,743
by walls and physical
barriers, with

143
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:41,508
little access to
work, to education.

144
00:10:41,794 --> 00:10:44,754
Even the basic means
of survival; food

145
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:47,907
and water is often
difficult to come by.

146
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:53,214
And then super-imposed on
that you have the settlers,

147
00:10:53,214 --> 00:10:56,971
who live in what look
like American-style

148
00:10:56,991 --> 00:11:01,038
suburbs, very spacious,
very luxurious homes

149
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:04,413
with swimming pools,
with access to water.

150
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,286
Immediately after the
1967 occupation, Israel

151
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:11,163
began building
Jewish-only settlements

152
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,701
in the occupied
territories and started

153
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:16,637
moving its population
into these settlements,

154
00:11:16,757 --> 00:11:20,611
a practice that is illegal
under international law.

155
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,865
There are approximately
220 Jewish-only

156
00:11:23,906 --> 00:11:27,055
settlements scattered
throughout the West Bank.

157
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:29,758
Their territorial jurisdiction
includes not only

158
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:32,389
the Palestinian land upon
which they’re built,

159
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:35,019
but often the land that
surrounds the settlements

160
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:39,055
which is reserved for their
so-called natural growth.

161
00:11:40,184 --> 00:11:43,375
Each of those settlements,
every single one of

162
00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:46,402
them, is only allocated
to Jewish Israelis.

163
00:11:46,402 --> 00:11:49,651
Roughly 60% of the West
Bank is allocated to,

164
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:52,584
or controlled by the
settlements, or the

165
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:54,477
military installations.

166
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:58,833
What we see in the
last 40 years is

167
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:04,154
vast Israeli government efforts
and vast amounts of public money

168
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:07,322
spent and poured into allocating
land in the territories,

169
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:12,774
building settlements on it, and
encouraging Israelis to move out

170
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,020
of Israel and into
these settlements.

171
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:24,817
Gilo is, I think, a neighborhood
where everybody is living.

172
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:29,546
Because if you can’t afford
to live in the center

173
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:32,204
of the city, you move out
to the new neighborhoods,

174
00:12:32,204 --> 00:12:34,884
and you’re going to
find you have everybody

175
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:37,788
living over here, religious
and not religious;

176
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:40,762
more people to the left,
people to the right,

177
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:47,094
because most people look at
Gilo as part of Jerusalem.

178
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:50,514
This is Gilo
settlement, which was

179
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:53,058
annexed in the ‘80s
and early ‘90s.

180
00:12:53,058 --> 00:12:55,954
They started building
it in the mid-‘80s,

181
00:12:55,954 --> 00:12:59,301
and they started bringing in
caravans, then it started being

182
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:01,798
built up and built
up until it became

183
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:04,334
a very big neighborhood
of Jerusalem,

184
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:07,837
accommodating thousands of
settlers’ families.

185
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:10,169
On Palestinian land.
The people there

186
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,461
didn’t sell the land.
They stole it.

187
00:13:13,404 --> 00:13:18,272
There was a decision
taken by Israel in 1967

188
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:23,048
that Jerusalem should
be reunited as one city

189
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:26,505
and part of that political
agenda was to build and

190
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:29,633
establish on the hills
surrounding Jerusalem,

191
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:31,881
new Jewish
neighborhoods in a way

192
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:34,101
that would make
it very difficult

193
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:38,352
to, again, divide the city
into two parts.

194
00:13:38,395 --> 00:13:40,619
The settlements were not
built for security.

195
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,985
They were built out of a
proactive claim to the country.

196
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:47,236
The words mislead.

197
00:13:47,236 --> 00:13:50,182
They're not a couple of little
trailers on the hillside.

198
00:13:50,182 --> 00:13:54,282
These are cities of 40, 50, 60,
70,000 people.

199
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,676
They’re built over
water aquifers.

200
00:13:57,676 --> 00:13:59,285
They’re built at key junctions.

201
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,196
They’re built on
certain hilltops.

202
00:14:01,196 --> 00:14:02,891
They’re built to
control movement.

203
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:04,724
They’re built to
control the border.

204
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:07,930
Every settlement
has its rationale.

205
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,666
We can see from here the village

206
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,719
extended toward the
settlement of Ariel,

207
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:20,036
which is located above
the hill over there.

208
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:24,157
Ariel, located in the
heart of the West Bank,

209
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:27,897
25 kilometers to the
east of the green line.

210
00:14:27,897 --> 00:14:31,898
There’s a very important aquifer
located underground,

211
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:35,032
under this area, which
the Israelis are

212
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:38,527
stealing. They are
enjoying the water.

213
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:42,106
They are irrigating their
gardens, washing their cars

214
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:46,224
and playing with their
dogs with water, and

215
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:50,001
here we are suffering
a shortage of water.

216
00:14:50,337 --> 00:14:53,022
Per capita Israelis
use about six

217
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:55,878
or seven times the
amount of water

218
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:58,820
that Palestinians use,
and many times in the

219
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,801
summer months Palestinians
do not get water,

220
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,186
even though it’s their
water that’s being pumped

221
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:06,317
out by the Israelis and
sold back to them,

222
00:15:06,317 --> 00:15:08,516
they don’t get
sufficient supplies.

223
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:13,179
They cut off water in summer,
meaning that we will be

224
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:18,090
without water for three or
four months of the year,

225
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:22,018
so we try to compensate for that
by collecting the rain

226
00:15:22,018 --> 00:15:26,078
in the cisterns and the wells,
which is not healthy.

227
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:28,073
But we are forced to use this

228
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,524
water, which causes
many diseases

229
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:33,518
for the children and for the
inhabitants in the village.

230
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:36,525
And my daughter was one case of

231
00:15:36,545 --> 00:15:40,060
that; she got a
very bad infection

232
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:44,165
because of the water,
and she got kidney failure.

233
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:53,234
Apartheid was the attempt
to separate people

234
00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:56,733
and allow resources and
privilege and rights

235
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:59,534
to flow to people on the
basis of the separate

236
00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:01,641
groups in which they
were categorized.

237
00:16:04,287 --> 00:16:05,741
And so the settlements are very

238
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:07,637
strategic; it’s not
just real estate.

239
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:11,307
They were built out of
aproactive claim to the country.

240
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,253
Nowhere is the
government’s separation

241
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:01,703
principal shown so
starkly as in the city

242
00:17:01,703 --> 00:17:03,886
of Hebron, a city
deep in the heart

243
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:06,048
of the West Bank
with a population

244
00:17:06,048 --> 00:17:09,040
of about 160,000 Palestinians.

245
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:12,596
In the middle of
Hebron, in Palestinian

246
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:15,104
homes, often vacated
under severe

247
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:17,726
pressure, live 600
Jewish settlers

248
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:22,059
cordoned off and protected by
thousands of soldiers.

249
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:26,663
Although neighbors, these
two populations live

250
00:17:26,683 --> 00:17:29,659
under two separate and
unequal sets of laws.

251
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:33,629
Jewish settlers in the West Bank
live under Israeli civil law,

252
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:37,852
while Palestinians live
under Israeli military law.

253
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,253
The settler population
in the West Bank

254
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:23,882
is roughly 500,000.
The Palestinian

255
00:18:23,882 --> 00:18:27,891
population in that same area
is roughly 2.5 million.

256
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:34,917
So we have a classic situation
of an ethnic minority claiming

257
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:37,962
the entire country,
a large territory,

258
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,621
and then, now, what
do with the natives?

259
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,969
What do you do with
the non-whoever

260
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,636
you are? in this
case, the non-Jews.

261
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:51,959
In South Africa, the
architecture was

262
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,724
amazing. First, you give
people an identity.

263
00:18:55,724 --> 00:18:58,698
Then, of course, you
give people pass laws,

264
00:18:58,718 --> 00:19:01,440
so you define how
they can move freely,

265
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,935
and you construct blockages
for the movement of people.

266
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:08,268
Control was exerted
through a complicated

267
00:19:08,288 --> 00:19:10,697
pass system that
determined when and where

268
00:19:10,697 --> 00:19:13,376
an African could move.
These passes

269
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:15,796
became one of the most detested

270
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:18,290
symbols of apartheid.

271
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:24,134
The issue of the pass
was much more than a

272
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:27,275
question of identity or
an identity document.

273
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:31,242
It was a mechanism to
ensure the control over

274
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:34,618
people’s movement and
where people lived.

275
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:08,655
Today in occupied Palestine,

276
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:12,150
Palestinians must carry
IDs at all times

277
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,798
that essentially dictate where
they can live, work and move.

278
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:18,952
A complex system of
movement restrictions

279
00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:22,468
requires special permits
to enter certain areas.

280
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,600
There are over 600
manned checkpoints and

281
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,946
physical roadblocks
in the West Bank

282
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:34,391
that restrict the
freedom of movement of

283
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:37,134
Palestinians. Only
36 of these separate

284
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:39,057
Israel and the West Bank.

285
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,357
The rest separate
Palestinian towns

286
00:20:42,377 --> 00:20:44,942
from other Palestinian towns.

287
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:55,746
Abuse, beatings, humiliation
at the checkpoints

288
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:58,862
is a routine part
of the experience.

289
00:20:58,862 --> 00:21:05,048
It’s part of the systematic
disempowerment of Palestinians,

290
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:08,282
placing an entire
population at the mercy of

291
00:21:08,323 --> 00:21:11,762
18, 19-year-old soldiers
who have absolute

292
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:15,196
power over the lives
of Palestinians.

293
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:23,278
How many? Is it over
60 women who have

294
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:25,361
given birth at
checkpoints because some

295
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:29,098
silly kid won’t let
them through, or taking

296
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:32,071
20 minutes to let an
ambulance through?

297
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:32,725
I have been able to
visit Israel and

298
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:36,025
Palestine, on more
than two occasions.

299
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:43,986
And what I experienced there was
such a crude reminder of a

300
00:23:43,986 --> 00:23:47,765
painful past in
Apartheid South Africa.

301
00:23:49,065 --> 00:23:52,632
We were largely controlled
in the same way.

302
00:23:54,882 --> 00:23:58,577
The continuous checking
at the roadblocks,

303
00:23:58,577 --> 00:24:02,208
and to see these
young men and young

304
00:24:02,228 --> 00:24:05,484
women standing at the roadblock,

305
00:24:05,484 --> 00:24:11,494
having to perform the
duties of a military junta.

306
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,399
These parallels with Israel
pained me severely while

307
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:28,554
I was travelling through
that lovely country.

308
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:41,833
The settlements are
linked by modern

309
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:45,100
superhighways, which
are Jewish-only roads.

310
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:47,921
Palestinians are not
allowed to use them,

311
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:52,116
and these super
highways crisscross

312
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,749
across Palestinian land, linking
the settlements together,

313
00:24:56,843 --> 00:25:03,843
and linking them with Israeli
cities inside the 1948 borders.

314
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,743
The separate roads
that you find, that

315
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:08,462
kind of settlement
infrastructure

316
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,171
that you find in the
West Bank, you know, in

317
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:13,795
South Africa, we didn’t
dream that we’d have

318
00:25:13,836 --> 00:25:15,710
roads that would be
only for whites.

319
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:19,392
In 2008 there were
800 kilometers of

320
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:22,161
Jewish-only roads
in the West Bank,

321
00:25:22,226 --> 00:25:24,432
or as the Israeli
military prefers

322
00:25:24,476 --> 00:25:26,447
to call them, "Sterile roads".

323
00:25:26,882 --> 00:25:29,368
Settlers are issued
yellow license plates

324
00:25:29,388 --> 00:25:31,978
so that the military
can distinguish

325
00:25:31,978 --> 00:25:34,608
them from Palestinian drivers.

326
00:26:29,192 --> 00:26:31,396
The other part of
this system is the

327
00:26:31,437 --> 00:26:34,104
Palestinian roads,
which is linking the

328
00:26:34,145 --> 00:26:36,117
Palestinian villages and cities

329
00:26:36,158 --> 00:26:38,728
together, but with
tunnels and bridges

330
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:40,800
under the main network
of roads that

331
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:42,725
they are creating
for themselves.

332
00:26:42,803 --> 00:26:47,695
And these bridges
and tunnels have gates,

333
00:26:47,695 --> 00:26:49,614
and the gates have
locks, and the keys

334
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:51,324
are in the hands
of the soldiers.

335
00:26:51,324 --> 00:26:54,349
So if they want to impose a
curfew all over the West Bank,

336
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:56,096
they can do it in two hours.

337
00:27:16,205 --> 00:27:19,878
The Jewish-only roads serving
the settlement of Avne Hefez,

338
00:27:19,878 --> 00:27:22,904
are but one of the many examples
of the segregated road

339
00:27:22,904 --> 00:27:26,739
system in the West Bank.
Because of the settlement,

340
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:29,171
Israel declared the
roads between the

341
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:31,966
Palestinian towns of
Shufa and Izbat Shufa

342
00:27:31,966 --> 00:27:34,620
a sterile road for
Jews only, erecting

343
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,520
dirt roadblocks for
Palestinians at every

344
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,120
exit of the town.

345
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:46,058
Recently, Israel allowed
Palestinian pedestrian

346
00:27:46,058 --> 00:27:48,539
but not vehicular
traffic on the road.

347
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,867
Due to these
conditions, one out of

348
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:53,915
every four families
has left Shufa.

349
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,089
(quiet music and road noise)

350
00:29:27,071 --> 00:29:29,143
A deeply religious
people, the white

351
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,503
Afrikaners of South
Africa believed they

352
00:29:31,544 --> 00:29:33,790
had a god-given right
to a land that

353
00:29:33,831 --> 00:29:36,035
they considered
mostly uninhabited.

354
00:29:36,163 --> 00:29:38,587
In what is known as
the great trek, what

355
00:29:38,628 --> 00:29:41,667
Afrikaners consider their
equivalent of the Exodus

356
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:44,576
thousands trekked
into the wilderness

357
00:29:44,596 --> 00:29:46,151
in search of the Promised Land.

358
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:50,073
The Afrikaners pushed
into land the Africans

359
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:52,788
considered theirs, and
many battles ensued.

360
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:56,350
Armed with guns and
protected by a circle

361
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,495
of covered wagons,
known as a “laager”,

362
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:01,700
the Afrikaners
easily beat back the

363
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,254
indigenous masses that
outnumbered them.

364
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:06,729
This image of the heroic
settlers in their

365
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,950
“laager” fending off
the savage masses

366
00:30:08,991 --> 00:30:13,677
became the dominant mythology in
Afrikaner history, morphing into

367
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:17,698
the philosophy of
Apartheid in 1948.

368
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:20,456
Under apartheid law,
the one standard

369
00:30:20,497 --> 00:30:22,644
against which
everything was judged

370
00:30:22,685 --> 00:30:25,486
was the security of
the state, and the

371
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,982
state meant the
Afrikaner people.

372
00:30:28,235 --> 00:30:30,466
With every law
enacted, the freedoms

373
00:30:30,486 --> 00:30:32,510
of the majority
were whittled away

374
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:36,549
in order to protect the
privileges of a white minority.

375
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:42,417
In Pretoria today stands
a monument to the Great

376
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:46,551
Trek, a shrine to this
history and philosophy.

377
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:51,677
A concrete "laager";
that iconic image of

378
00:30:51,697 --> 00:30:54,607
the Afrikaners’ military
defense tactic,

379
00:30:54,607 --> 00:30:57,151
completely surrounds
the monument.

380
00:30:58,377 --> 00:31:01,862
A physical representation
of a state of mind

381
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:05,131
that sees enemies
everywhere and will

382
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:07,979
do anything to protect
against them.

383
00:31:19,864 --> 00:31:23,843
What I experienced
there was made even

384
00:31:23,863 --> 00:31:28,169
more painful by the
existence of the wall

385
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:31,357
of separation, what
we from South Africa

386
00:31:31,377 --> 00:31:33,803
prefer to call the
Apartheid wall.

387
00:31:33,844 --> 00:31:38,067
We didn’t have that type of
division in South Africa.

388
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:42,543
In 2002, under the
guise of a temporary

389
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:46,184
security measure, Israel
began construction

390
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:48,795
of the separation
barrier to completely

391
00:31:48,836 --> 00:31:51,477
seal off the West
Bank from Israel.

392
00:31:52,464 --> 00:31:56,589
In urban areas it is a concrete
wall eight meters tall.

393
00:31:57,226 --> 00:32:00,271
In rural areas it
is a “smart” fence

394
00:32:00,472 --> 00:32:03,702
averaging 60 meters
wide, with motion,

395
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:07,076
heat and vibration
sensors, cameras,

396
00:32:07,456 --> 00:32:12,486
trenches, patrol
roads, and razor wire.

397
00:32:15,318 --> 00:32:18,623
To many however, the
wall is not about security.

398
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,449
Its snake-like
route through the

399
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:28,266
West Bank annexes
large Jewish-only

400
00:32:28,286 --> 00:32:31,004
settlements,
agricultural land and

401
00:32:31,004 --> 00:32:34,248
important water resources,
clearly marking

402
00:32:34,268 --> 00:32:37,076
it as a tool for
massive land grabs.

403
00:32:37,547 --> 00:32:41,238
Only 15% of the wall
follows the green line.

404
00:32:41,258 --> 00:32:44,557
Instead, the wall
twists and turns deep

405
00:32:44,557 --> 00:32:47,266
into the West Bank,
making it more than

406
00:32:47,286 --> 00:32:50,014
twice as long as the
green line itself.

407
00:32:53,101 --> 00:32:55,613
It separates Palestinian
villages from

408
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:57,841
neighboring
Palestinian villages,

409
00:32:57,841 --> 00:33:01,766
farmers from their land and
income, parents from children,

410
00:33:01,766 --> 00:33:05,656
and severely restricts
Palestinian freedom of movement.

411
00:33:05,656 --> 00:33:08,520
It encircles many
towns from all sides

412
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,276
creating isolated
ghettos surrounded

413
00:33:11,276 --> 00:33:16,295
by walls, checkpoints and
Israeli-only roads.

414
00:33:19,806 --> 00:33:22,853
When you put people
behind the wall, in

415
00:33:22,873 --> 00:33:25,710
all of these ghettos,
because almost

416
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:30,778
everywhere it is creating ghetto
communities with one road or one

417
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:34,164
checkpoint or one tunnel with
a gate on it.

418
00:33:34,164 --> 00:33:36,514
Then at a certain
point there is going

419
00:33:36,534 --> 00:33:38,722
to be, when there's
not enough work

420
00:33:38,722 --> 00:33:42,451
and not enough food, more
and more pressure built up.

421
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,091
Obviously a lot of
people will leave, and

422
00:33:46,132 --> 00:33:48,333
I think that’s part
of the intention.

423
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:54,405
(music)

424
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:05,382
Now in the South
African context, the

425
00:34:05,402 --> 00:34:07,251
attempt by the
Apartheid government

426
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:10,489
was to take away
citizenship from more

427
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:14,018
than 80% of the South
African population,

428
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:16,563
and then give them
new citizenship

429
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:19,075
in some kind of a
fantasy entity:

430
00:34:19,075 --> 00:34:20,972
Bophuthatswana, Transkei, etc.
So

431
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,966
the South African
state could say,

432
00:34:22,966 --> 00:34:27,257
“You have no claims here. You’re
a citizen of Bophuthatswana.

433
00:34:27,257 --> 00:34:29,011
Social benefits,
etcetera, are what

434
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:30,706
you should be
looking for there.”

435
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:33,951
The godfather of the system was
Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd.

436
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:36,602
- "In South Africa
you can only achieve

437
00:34:36,622 --> 00:34:38,892
peace by separating
the nations."

438
00:34:39,258 --> 00:34:41,907
And he spelled out the whole
Bantustan concept.

439
00:34:41,907 --> 00:34:43,560
He said: “The black
people have got

440
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,161
to be given their
own countries.”

441
00:34:46,968 --> 00:34:49,337
They embarked upon
this remarkable

442
00:34:49,357 --> 00:34:52,293
experiment of trying
to cut up the country

443
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:55,621
into Bantustans, and
these were created,

444
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:58,908
at least on paper,
ten of them, and the

445
00:34:58,908 --> 00:35:03,375
move began to advance them
towards independence.

446
00:35:05,117 --> 00:35:07,055
(trumpet)

447
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:12,010
My government would
like to continue as we

448
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,567
are, an autonomous and
independent country,

449
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:18,262
preferably with
extended borders,

450
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,757
continued friendly and cordial

451
00:35:20,757 --> 00:35:23,560
relations with our
neighbors and, if

452
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,402
possible, international
recognition.

453
00:35:26,402 --> 00:35:29,153
Most of them were
stooges and really

454
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:31,570
puppets of the Apartheid state.

455
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,838
To give some veneer of
reality to the fantasy

456
00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:38,004
of the Bantustans, the
Afrikaner government

457
00:35:38,004 --> 00:35:40,742
threw money at them,
built elaborate

458
00:35:40,762 --> 00:35:43,446
parliaments, housing
for ministers,

459
00:35:43,446 --> 00:35:46,518
built airports, sports stadiums.

460
00:35:46,538 --> 00:35:50,016
It was to create
separate states.

461
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:52,317
It was not so much a two-state

462
00:35:52,337 --> 00:35:55,200
solution as a
multi-state solution.

463
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,709
When I look at Israel, when I
traveled through the West Bank,

464
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,925
I was looking at
Bantustans, totally

465
00:36:01,966 --> 00:36:04,391
unviable, impossible states.

466
00:36:04,928 --> 00:36:07,268
In many respects, it
struck me as being

467
00:36:07,288 --> 00:36:09,772
significantly worse
than Apartheid.

468
00:36:09,772 --> 00:36:12,644
Bantustans, as much as
we abhorred them in

469
00:36:12,664 --> 00:36:15,421
South Africa, Bantustan
leaders actually

470
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:17,267
had more power and more control

471
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:19,515
than the Palestinian
Authority has.

472
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:22,272
What the Oslo did was create an

473
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:26,054
authority,which allowed
Israel to still

474
00:36:26,054 --> 00:36:29,415
control the occupied
Palestinian territory, but

475
00:36:29,435 --> 00:36:32,534
control it through a
Palestinian authority.

476
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,806
Ostensibly, there’s some
kind of Palestinian

477
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:40,288
authority that’s
controlling, that’s in power

478
00:36:40,288 --> 00:36:42,123
of the occupied territory.
But in

479
00:36:42,143 --> 00:36:44,052
fact, Israel controls
the borders.

480
00:36:44,052 --> 00:36:48,056
Israel controls taxes.
Israel controls all kinds

481
00:36:48,076 --> 00:36:51,608
of things, access in
and out of that area.

482
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,246
To me, the big analogy
was that South

483
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:02,066
Africa, in taking
these two choices

484
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:04,361
where you’ve got two
or more nationalisms

485
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:06,255
laying claim to
the same country,

486
00:37:06,255 --> 00:37:08,943
you’ve either got to find
a way to live together,

487
00:37:08,963 --> 00:37:11,130
or you’ve got to have
a fair partition.

488
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,588
The big similarity
between Apartheid

489
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:16,354
South Africa and the
Israeli/Palestinian

490
00:37:16,354 --> 00:37:19,989
situation is that both
decided to have a

491
00:37:20,009 --> 00:37:23,663
partition solution,
and, in both cases,

492
00:37:23,663 --> 00:37:26,705
it was a grotesquely
unfair partition.

493
00:37:26,855 --> 00:37:30,522
And this is why Israel says,
“Well, Gaza is not our problem,

494
00:37:30,563 --> 00:37:33,155
Gaza is a foreign country.
It’s not a state.

495
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:37,179
It’s not part of any other
country. It’s just not us.”

496
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:39,030
Just like South
Africa, it’s the same

497
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:41,264
logic. We need a
Palestinian state,

498
00:37:41,305 --> 00:37:43,334
because we can’t digest
the Palestinians.

499
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:44,917
We can’t give them citizenship,

500
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:47,342
because then it wouldn’t
be a Jewish state.

501
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,966
We have to create a
Palestinian state,

502
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:51,976
because that’s the
only way we can

503
00:37:51,996 --> 00:37:54,026
get them off our
hands, but it has

504
00:37:54,026 --> 00:37:56,473
to be a minimized
state on as little

505
00:37:56,493 --> 00:37:58,960
territory as possible
that leaves us

506
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:01,171
in control of the
entire country.

507
00:38:02,277 --> 00:38:04,481
In South Africa,
they left 13% of

508
00:38:04,522 --> 00:38:06,680
South Africa for the non-whites.

509
00:38:06,925 --> 00:38:09,935
In cantons, locking
them inside cantons.

510
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:11,947
Here, when you look
at the map, what

511
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:13,944
they have created
is leaving to the

512
00:38:13,944 --> 00:38:16,781
Palestinians about 12% of our
historical land.

513
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,157
This is the ghetto
state, ghetto system

514
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:21,341
that they are creating,
and it's totally

515
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,429
disconnected from each other.
We have

516
00:38:23,494 --> 00:38:25,725
one, two, three, and
the fourth is Gaza.

517
00:38:27,016 --> 00:38:31,289
(explosions and drums)

518
00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:34,015
(siren)

519
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:48,477
(drums and ambient sounds)

520
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,673
Since 2006, Israel
has imposed a deadly

521
00:40:08,714 --> 00:40:11,694
siege on the Gaza
Strip, prohibiting

522
00:40:11,735 --> 00:40:15,473
most goods and people from
entering or leaving the enclave.

523
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:19,652
The siege has caused an
economic standstill in

524
00:40:19,693 --> 00:40:23,336
Gaza. The unemployment
rate hovers around 40%.

525
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,358
On the more ridiculous end
of spectrum of goods not

526
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:31,360
allowed into Gaza are things
like pasta and chocolate.

527
00:40:32,194 --> 00:40:34,914
Recently obtained Israeli
government documents

528
00:40:34,955 --> 00:40:37,209
show this to be a
deliberate policy.

529
00:40:37,717 --> 00:40:40,578
Mathematic formulas were
created which defined

530
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:43,377
the minimum caloric needs
of the 1.5 million

531
00:40:43,418 --> 00:40:46,849
people in Gaza. As well
as the upper limit, so

532
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:49,937
that food items cannot
become too plentiful.

533
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,732
In 2009 Israel
bombed Gaza’s sewage

534
00:40:55,773 --> 00:40:58,720
treatment facilities
and electricity plants

535
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,882
and now won’t allow
the necessary

536
00:41:00,923 --> 00:41:02,883
parts in to repair them.

537
00:41:03,326 --> 00:41:06,100
Restrictions on fuel
imports further limit the

538
00:41:06,141 --> 00:41:09,101
ability of critical
infrastructure to function.

539
00:41:09,142 --> 00:41:12,606
while also causing daily,
prolonged blackouts.

540
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:16,617
Blackouts can be deadly for
patients in hospitals.

541
00:41:16,658 --> 00:41:19,125
But more so is the
lack of medicine,

542
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:21,736
specialized care,
and clean water.

543
00:41:49,578 --> 00:41:52,503
In the worst times
of Apartheid in

544
00:41:52,523 --> 00:41:55,636
South Africa, we
never had in any of

545
00:41:55,636 --> 00:41:58,608
our townships
helicopter gunships

546
00:41:58,628 --> 00:42:01,884
flying overhead or
F-16 type bombers

547
00:42:01,884 --> 00:42:03,888
flying over townships and firing

548
00:42:03,908 --> 00:42:06,184
or dropping bombs
into a township.

549
00:42:06,184 --> 00:42:07,001
It didn’t happen.

550
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:14,015
The problem is we don’t have
other examples to look at now.

551
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,934
You could look at
perhaps the Warsaw

552
00:42:15,975 --> 00:42:17,982
ghetto as one example
of that kind of

553
00:42:17,982 --> 00:42:21,994
walled-in and then attacking a
walled-in community like that.

554
00:42:21,994 --> 00:42:24,556
Maybe a better example
is hundreds and

555
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:26,959
hundreds of years
ago where you had

556
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:32,178
walled city-states that were
completely besieged by armies

557
00:42:32,178 --> 00:42:34,787
where no one could
get out and food was

558
00:42:34,807 --> 00:42:37,698
denied, and if there
wasn’t a spring within

559
00:42:37,698 --> 00:42:40,508
the city, no one had
water, and people died.

560
00:42:40,549 --> 00:42:42,408
Just like in Gaza,
people died from

561
00:42:42,449 --> 00:42:44,271
insufficient access to medicine,

562
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,211
to insufficient water, all those

563
00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:48,743
reasons, as well
as by air strikes.

564
00:42:51,475 --> 00:42:55,123
There are a number of people and
some governments who claim that

565
00:42:55,164 --> 00:42:57,468
because Israel
withdrew its settlers

566
00:42:57,488 --> 00:42:59,560
and soldiers from the Gaza Strip

567
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,770
unilaterally in 2005,
that it’s no longer

568
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,020
the occupying power,
but that is actually

569
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,023
not the case. In
international law,

570
00:43:06,064 --> 00:43:08,476
occupation refers to the control

571
00:43:08,517 --> 00:43:10,416
of territory by
another government,

572
00:43:10,436 --> 00:43:12,408
not the indigenous
government there.

573
00:43:12,408 --> 00:43:14,992
That’s precisely
what exists with

574
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:17,845
Israel and the Gaza
Strip right now.

575
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,920
Israel still
controls the land of

576
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,097
the Gaza Strip,
which, many people

577
00:43:22,097 --> 00:43:24,325
don’t know, is completely
surrounded by a

578
00:43:24,345 --> 00:43:26,592
wall very similar to
the wall that snakes

579
00:43:26,592 --> 00:43:29,437
through the West Bank. It
is completely surrounded.

580
00:43:29,478 --> 00:43:33,011
The Israeli Navy controls
the seas off the coast of Gaza.

581
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,375
(gunfire)

582
00:43:36,093 --> 00:43:38,232
The airspace is
controlled by Israel,

583
00:43:38,232 --> 00:43:40,517
which has prohibited
the Palestinians

584
00:43:40,537 --> 00:43:42,164
from reopening their airport.

585
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:46,343
So Gaza is completely under the
control of the Israelis.

586
00:43:48,784 --> 00:43:51,359
The Palestinian
Authority can’t issue

587
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,882
identity documents,
passports, permission

588
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:57,397
for people to come
and go, independent

589
00:43:57,438 --> 00:43:59,421
of the Israeli
Interior Ministry.

590
00:43:59,552 --> 00:44:02,453
If you don’t exist in
the Israeli Interior

591
00:44:02,494 --> 00:44:06,093
Ministry database, you
don't exist period.

592
00:44:10,763 --> 00:44:13,242
If you look at a
blueprint of a prison,

593
00:44:14,132 --> 00:44:16,820
it looks like the
prisoners own the place.

594
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:20,156
They have 95% of the
territory, right?

595
00:44:20,197 --> 00:44:23,409
They have the living areas,
they have the exercise yard,

596
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:26,226
they have the cafeteria,
they have the work

597
00:44:26,267 --> 00:44:29,276
areas. It all belongs
to the prisoners.

598
00:44:29,317 --> 00:44:33,597
All the prison authorities have
is maybe 5%. And you know what?

599
00:44:33,597 --> 00:44:35,993
If it’s a minimal
security prison, maybe

600
00:44:36,013 --> 00:44:38,075
they have 1%. That’s
all you need.

601
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:41,334
You need the walls
around, cell bars,

602
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:43,486
you have some
corridors, you have

603
00:44:43,486 --> 00:44:47,848
a few locked doors, and that’s
it. With 1% of the territory,

604
00:44:47,848 --> 00:44:50,492
you can absolutely
control the inmates,

605
00:44:50,533 --> 00:44:53,217
and that helps you
make the switch.

606
00:44:53,258 --> 00:44:56,718
The issue here isn’t how much
territory the prisoners have.

607
00:44:56,818 --> 00:44:59,720
The issue is, can they get out
of the prison?

608
00:45:16,734 --> 00:45:20,076
When the majority
of world leaders

609
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,934
and people who have the power

610
00:45:21,975 --> 00:45:25,888
to change things talk about a
two-state solution, nowadays

611
00:45:25,888 --> 00:45:28,360
what they talk about
is a Palestinian

612
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,545
state that is made of Bantustans

613
00:45:30,545 --> 00:45:33,156
separated from each
other, a state that has

614
00:45:33,176 --> 00:45:35,628
no sovereignty, no
independent policies,

615
00:45:35,628 --> 00:45:39,107
and has a very much
similar economic

616
00:45:39,148 --> 00:45:41,074
infrastructure to
the ones that the

617
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:43,121
Bantustans had in South Africa.

618
00:45:43,121 --> 00:45:45,230
The main thing for
the world and for

619
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,437
the Israelis is to
get this issue off

620
00:45:47,437 --> 00:45:49,467
the plate, and
that’s where Israel

621
00:45:49,487 --> 00:45:51,245
thinks it can get away with a

622
00:45:51,245 --> 00:45:53,405
Bantustan in the way
that South Africa

623
00:45:53,425 --> 00:45:55,325
couldn’t. You know,
you can push a

624
00:45:55,325 --> 00:45:58,093
two-state solution that's
Apartheid.

625
00:45:58,268 --> 00:46:00,179
If it doesn’t have
borders, it doesn’t

626
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,268
have water, doesn’t
have access to its

627
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:05,062
greater economic resource,
which is Jerusalem.

628
00:46:05,104 --> 00:46:08,230
It’s carved into little islands.
There’s no freedom of movement

629
00:46:08,271 --> 00:46:12,023
there's no freedom of commerce.
It’s a prison state.

630
00:46:12,578 --> 00:46:16,620
Therefore, the essential idea
of a two-state solution

631
00:46:16,661 --> 00:46:21,193
has to be not only the state
itself, but a viable state.

632
00:46:21,401 --> 00:46:23,929
The Israelis have
rendered the West Bank

633
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:27,164
and Gaza unviable,
hopelessly unviable.

634
00:46:27,322 --> 00:46:32,012
I’m saying Israel no longer has
that solution as an option.

635
00:46:32,176 --> 00:46:35,665
It has made a two-state
solution impossible.

636
00:46:35,685 --> 00:46:38,180
Physically, morally impossible.

637
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:43,392
- It is time for us to go
ahead and move forward

638
00:46:43,412 --> 00:46:47,429
on a two-state solution,
so thank you very much.

639
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,945
You hear all this talk
about the two-state

640
00:46:49,986 --> 00:46:53,432
solution. You see opinion
polls that say a

641
00:46:53,473 --> 00:46:56,290
majority of Israelis are
willing to accept it,

642
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,086
and a majority of
Palestinians are willing to

643
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:02,486
accept it, but that
consensus disappears the

644
00:47:02,506 --> 00:47:06,125
moment you try to actually
flesh it out in detail.

645
00:47:06,295 --> 00:47:08,887
That’s why all the
two-state solution

646
00:47:08,928 --> 00:47:10,875
proposals are extremely vague,

647
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,062
because Palestinians
say, “The West Bank and

648
00:47:14,103 --> 00:47:17,320
Gaza are only a fifth
of historic Palestine.

649
00:47:17,394 --> 00:47:20,150
Why should we give up
anymore?” Israelis

650
00:47:20,191 --> 00:47:22,697
say, “Well, there’s
450,000 settlers

651
00:47:22,738 --> 00:47:25,328
in those areas,
several generations.

652
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:26,882
Why should they leave?”

653
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:33,312
The only thing more difficult
than trying to live together,

654
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:35,921
would be trying to
force a separation.

655
00:47:59,938 --> 00:48:02,266
(music)

656
00:48:11,037 --> 00:48:15,234
Israel’s overall goal
has been to create

657
00:48:15,275 --> 00:48:20,328
a Jewish state. In
1948, 75% of the

658
00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:23,310
population, the
non-Jewish population,

659
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:25,801
Christians and
Muslims, were expelled

660
00:48:25,801 --> 00:48:27,966
from their homeland and never
allowed to return.

661
00:48:27,966 --> 00:48:29,508
For one reason, and
only one reason,

662
00:48:29,528 --> 00:48:30,963
which is that
they’re not Jewish.

663
00:48:34,756 --> 00:48:39,576
The 5 to 6 million
refugees living in Lebanon

664
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:43,335
and Syria and Jordan, etc.
those are people

665
00:48:43,376 --> 00:48:46,638
that should be Israeli
citizens, that Israel

666
00:48:46,658 --> 00:48:49,576
has kicked out and
refused citizenship.

667
00:48:49,979 --> 00:48:52,320
Over a million
Palestinians became

668
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:56,199
refugees in the
1948 and 1967 wars.

669
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,787
By natural population
growth, they

670
00:48:58,807 --> 00:49:01,078
now number over 5 million people

671
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,140
who still await their
right to return.

672
00:49:04,481 --> 00:49:06,991
Some Palestinians
managed to stay

673
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:09,689
inside what became
Israel in 1948,

674
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:13,429
and today make up 20%
of Israeli citizens.

675
00:49:16,992 --> 00:49:19,543
So in the Israeli state,
what kind of rights

676
00:49:19,584 --> 00:49:21,978
and privileges and
resources are allocated

677
00:49:21,978 --> 00:49:23,803
to you are entirely dependent on

678
00:49:23,823 --> 00:49:25,841
which ethnic group
you come from.

679
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:28,621
You’re either Jewish
or you’re Palestinian,

680
00:49:28,641 --> 00:49:30,789
or Arab, as they
prefer to call them.

681
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:33,305
And so you have a
situation where welfare

682
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:35,252
benefits for people,
for example,

683
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:39,100
are dependent on whether
they’re Jewish or not.

684
00:49:39,141 --> 00:49:42,242
You have a situation where
a Jew can’t marry a

685
00:49:42,283 --> 00:49:46,700
non-Jew in Israel. For
us South Africans, we

686
00:49:46,741 --> 00:49:48,663
remember the Mixed
Marriages Act, for

687
00:49:48,683 --> 00:49:50,881
example. You have a
situation where people

688
00:49:50,881 --> 00:49:54,340
from one ethnic group,
Palestinians, are not

689
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,994
able to freely live in
areas that are majority

690
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:01,218
Jewish, similar to
old Group Areas Act.

691
00:50:03,857 --> 00:50:05,846
Now one of the criticisms
people make when

692
00:50:05,887 --> 00:50:07,663
you start accusing
Israel of being an

693
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:11,271
Apartheid state inside its own
borders is that they’ll say,

694
00:50:11,312 --> 00:50:14,123
“Well, Palestinians
can sit next to Jews

695
00:50:14,164 --> 00:50:16,237
inside restaurants.
They sit on the same

696
00:50:16,237 --> 00:50:18,401
buses. They go to the same
cinemas,” and that’s true,

697
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:21,546
but that’s not really the
significance of Apartheid.

698
00:50:21,587 --> 00:50:23,276
The idea of Apartheid
isn’t really about

699
00:50:23,317 --> 00:50:24,911
the fact that people
can't sit on the same

700
00:50:24,911 --> 00:50:27,140
park bench. It was
about controlling

701
00:50:27,181 --> 00:50:30,259
resources, making
sure that one ethnic

702
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,520
group had control of resources
and the other didn't.

703
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,096
And, in that sense,
Israel has been

704
00:50:34,116 --> 00:50:35,712
very, very effective
at doing this,

705
00:50:35,712 --> 00:50:37,182
what we might call
grand Apartheid

706
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:38,436
rather than petty Apartheid.

707
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:40,881
In the key areas of
people’s lives, their

708
00:50:40,901 --> 00:50:43,366
education, their
employment, owning land,

709
00:50:43,851 --> 00:50:45,575
Palestinian citizens
are treated entirely

710
00:50:45,595 --> 00:50:47,226
differently from
Jewish citizens,

711
00:50:47,267 --> 00:50:49,825
and I think that’s one
of the reasons why

712
00:50:49,866 --> 00:50:52,155
this Apartheid
comparison can be made.

713
00:50:52,535 --> 00:50:55,125
By far, the most
fundamental element of

714
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:58,211
Apartheid with both
South Africa and Israel

715
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:01,846
is control of the land.
In apartheid South

716
00:51:01,887 --> 00:51:04,819
Africa, a slew of
laws were enacted

717
00:51:04,819 --> 00:51:09,250
that designated 87% of
the land for whites only.

718
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:12,511
This introduced the
oxymoronic term

719
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:15,573
"Foreign Natives"
into the language

720
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:18,382
of parliament to
describe blacks given

721
00:51:18,423 --> 00:51:20,914
permission to live
in white areas.

722
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:23,560
Israel’s complex and
creative web of

723
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:25,879
apartheid laws
introduced equally

724
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,803
oxymoronic terms such
as "Present Absentee"

725
00:51:29,844 --> 00:51:32,242
into its parliamentary language.

726
00:51:32,283 --> 00:51:34,760
This was used to
describe Palestinians

727
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:37,362
who are actually
present inside Israel,

728
00:51:37,403 --> 00:51:41,752
but legally declared absent in
order to confiscate their land.

729
00:51:42,379 --> 00:51:44,961
Through these colonial
and apartheid style

730
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:48,104
laws, over 90% of
the land of Israel

731
00:51:48,145 --> 00:51:51,062
is effectively reserved
for Jews only.

732
00:51:53,149 --> 00:51:55,941
Aside from the few mixed
cities like Haifa

733
00:51:55,982 --> 00:51:58,794
and Akko, most of
Israel’s communities are

734
00:51:58,835 --> 00:52:02,125
segregated along ethnic lines.
Israel’s

735
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:05,203
1.3 million Palestinian
citizens are

736
00:52:05,244 --> 00:52:08,828
restricted to 120
communities that existed

737
00:52:08,869 --> 00:52:12,023
before the creation
of Israel in 1948,

738
00:52:12,064 --> 00:52:15,164
and which have been unable to
expand since.

739
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,785
By contrast, Israel
has created and

740
00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:20,427
developed more than
700 exclusively

741
00:52:20,468 --> 00:52:23,659
Jewish towns since
1948, but not one

742
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,617
new town for
Palestinian citizens.

743
00:52:26,773 --> 00:52:29,538
Land laws in Israel
are very clearly

744
00:52:29,558 --> 00:52:32,554
Apartheid kind of laws.
You can belong

745
00:52:32,554 --> 00:52:34,312
in the state of
Israel, you can be a

746
00:52:34,332 --> 00:52:36,159
Palestinian, or you
can be a Jew, but

747
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:38,119
if you want to have
rights in the state,

748
00:52:38,139 --> 00:52:40,351
really you need to be
a Jew to have rights.

749
00:52:42,163 --> 00:52:43,904
I have no doubt it’s
a Jewish state, but

750
00:52:43,945 --> 00:52:45,781
I do question very
strongly whether

751
00:52:45,822 --> 00:52:48,117
it’s a democratic state.
If we talked

752
00:52:48,158 --> 00:52:51,109
about an Afrikaner and
democratic state,

753
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,867
I think most of us
would find that

754
00:52:52,908 --> 00:52:54,917
rather an oxymoronic
phrase to use.

755
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:58,765
So why is Jewish and democratic
not equally troubling to us?

756
00:52:58,806 --> 00:53:00,679
There are more than a
million Palestinians

757
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,480
inside Israel today,
and that's a major

758
00:53:02,521 --> 00:53:04,308
concern for Israel. It’s
very concerned about

759
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:05,960
the demographic growth,
as it calls it,

760
00:53:06,001 --> 00:53:09,218
the demographic time bomb, of
the Palestinians inside Israel.

761
00:53:09,259 --> 00:53:12,066
I came to realize
that when they talk

762
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:14,562
about the elimination of Israel,

763
00:53:15,242 --> 00:53:17,497
it’s a demographic thing.

764
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:20,656
That Israel will
cease to exist when

765
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,195
it no longer has a
Jewish majority.

766
00:53:23,664 --> 00:53:27,094
In other words, your
nationhood depends

767
00:53:27,114 --> 00:53:30,443
upon your having
either an ethnic or

768
00:53:30,443 --> 00:53:33,187
a specifically
religious majority,

769
00:53:33,447 --> 00:53:35,296
permanently entrenched.

770
00:53:35,507 --> 00:53:37,748
Because of the
experience I’ve gone

771
00:53:37,768 --> 00:53:40,091
through in this
country, where I saw

772
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:43,804
terrible injustice
committed in the name

773
00:53:44,234 --> 00:53:47,482
of the Afrikaners’
need to survive,

774
00:53:47,523 --> 00:53:51,539
I became ashamed of my country,
grievously ashamed of it.

775
00:53:52,242 --> 00:53:55,262
The reason Israel has
a Jewish majority

776
00:53:55,282 --> 00:53:58,476
is through entirely
artificial means.

777
00:53:58,718 --> 00:54:04,091
The whole framework of
Israeli law is designed to

778
00:54:04,132 --> 00:54:07,670
prevent the growth of the
non-Jewish population

779
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:11,677
and maintain Jewish
numerical and political

780
00:54:11,718 --> 00:54:14,833
supremacy, and that’s
the framework in which

781
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:17,812
we can understand
everything we see inside

782
00:54:17,853 --> 00:54:21,423
Israel, as well as in
the West Bank and Gaza.

783
00:54:29,445 --> 00:54:31,953
(music)

784
00:54:42,998 --> 00:54:47,443
(rain and ambient sounds)

785
00:54:54,714 --> 00:54:57,056
(chatting)

786
00:55:07,765 --> 00:55:10,921
(shouting)

787
00:55:25,029 --> 00:55:28,998
In Occupied East Jerusalem,
the battle for control

788
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:33,184
of territory is happening
on a house-by-house basis.

789
00:55:36,992 --> 00:55:41,351
(shouting and arguing)

790
00:56:03,372 --> 00:56:05,489
(shouting)

791
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:14,081
Israel goes to
incredible lengths

792
00:56:14,122 --> 00:56:16,216
to manipulate demography,

793
00:56:16,257 --> 00:56:19,250
as can be seen in the
stark but complicated

794
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:21,765
case of the city of Jerusalem.

795
00:56:23,533 --> 00:56:25,785
East Jerusalem differs
from the rest of

796
00:56:25,826 --> 00:56:28,688
occupied Palestinian
territory in that Israel

797
00:56:28,729 --> 00:56:31,305
unilaterally declared it
a part of the state of

798
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:35,055
Israel after the 1967
occupation of the city.

799
00:56:35,602 --> 00:56:37,834
No country in the world
has ever recognized

800
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:40,259
that annexation, and
it is still considered

801
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,828
occupied territory
by the Palestinians

802
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:44,871
and by international law.

803
00:56:45,824 --> 00:56:47,527
But by building the wall and the

804
00:56:47,568 --> 00:56:49,578
vast settlement
blocks around it,

805
00:56:49,691 --> 00:56:51,945
Israel has illegally
severed it from the

806
00:56:51,986 --> 00:56:56,755
West Bank. Over
250,000 Palestinians

807
00:56:56,796 --> 00:57:00,483
now find themselves on the
Israel side of the wall.

808
00:57:00,968 --> 00:57:03,369
Palestinians of East
Jerusalem are not

809
00:57:03,389 --> 00:57:05,685
citizens of the
country, cannot vote

810
00:57:05,685 --> 00:57:09,984
in national elections and cannot
live in Jewish West Jerusalem.

811
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,200
A Palestinian can have
lived in Jerusalem

812
00:57:14,241 --> 00:57:17,200
all his life, been
born here, his father,

813
00:57:17,241 --> 00:57:18,992
grandfather, and generations

814
00:57:19,033 --> 00:57:21,613
before, but he will
be a resident.

815
00:57:22,859 --> 00:57:27,943
A Jew from Russia can
come today to Israel,

816
00:57:27,984 --> 00:57:31,094
not even knowing one
word of Hebrew,

817
00:57:31,445 --> 00:57:35,018
and in the same day,
he becomes a citizen.

818
00:57:35,081 --> 00:57:38,171
There are many,
many conditions to

819
00:57:38,212 --> 00:57:41,323
be a resident. If
you, for example,

820
00:57:41,323 --> 00:57:44,223
live in Jerusalem but
you work in Ramallah,

821
00:57:44,243 --> 00:57:46,831
Bethlehem or elsewhere
in the occupied

822
00:57:46,831 --> 00:57:49,219
terriroties they say
the center of your

823
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:52,398
life is there, and
we can take your ID.

824
00:57:54,407 --> 00:57:59,500
This is one of the
strategies to make

825
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:02,484
the number of
Palestinians smaller.

826
00:58:05,154 --> 00:58:09,163
This is an official booklet,
from the municipality

827
00:58:09,204 --> 00:58:12,320
of Jerusalem, from the
Department of Planning.

828
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:16,508
I mean, from the first
point here, They

829
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:21,037
say: "Is to keep
the ratio between

830
00:58:21,078 --> 00:58:26,359
Jews and Palestinians as
it was in 1967 at..." Look

831
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:31,234
at this: "70 to 30" As
the government decided.

832
00:58:32,324 --> 00:58:35,417
You must understand,
if in any democratic

833
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:38,422
country in the world,
someone says that

834
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:42,711
the Jews will be no more than
40 percent of the population,

835
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:46,420
we would say that this
is anti-Semitism.

836
00:58:46,461 --> 00:58:48,922
It's clear that it would
be anti-Semitism.

837
00:58:49,036 --> 00:58:52,232
So why is it
anti-Semitism in Europe

838
00:58:52,273 --> 00:58:54,590
or America if someone does this,

839
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:57,336
and in Israel, it's permitted.
Why?

840
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,587
The politicians are
hysterical over

841
00:59:00,628 --> 00:59:03,534
this issue, and they
try to implement

842
00:59:03,575 --> 00:59:06,722
a policy of segregation,
in order to make

843
00:59:06,742 --> 00:59:09,607
the lives of the
Palestinians so bad,

844
00:59:09,607 --> 00:59:16,688
that they will decide to
voluntarily leave the city.

845
00:59:18,993 --> 00:59:21,141
(music)

846
00:59:25,394 --> 00:59:27,234
One of the harshest
methods used to

847
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:29,676
force Palestinians
to leave Jerusalem

848
00:59:29,717 --> 00:59:32,563
is Israel’s house
demolition policy.

849
00:59:36,102 --> 00:59:38,235
(machinery and crumbling rubble)

850
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:41,490
This policy affects
all Palestinians

851
00:59:41,531 --> 00:59:44,115
living within Israel’s
stated borders,

852
00:59:44,156 --> 00:59:46,078
and even within the
rest of the West

853
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:48,758
Bank, but it is
starkest in Jerusalem.

854
00:59:53,157 --> 00:59:55,993
(machinery)

855
00:59:57,902 --> 01:00:00,758
House demolitions are
part of a system

856
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:03,399
of discrimination
that does not enable

857
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,493
Palestinians to
actually build legally.

858
01:00:05,513 --> 01:00:07,469
It’s fair to say
that it’s virtually

859
01:00:07,469 --> 01:00:10,648
impossible to receive
a building permit,

860
01:00:10,668 --> 01:00:13,164
a legal permit to build a house

861
01:00:13,164 --> 01:00:15,959
in East Jerusalem if
you’re a Palestinian.

862
01:01:23,686 --> 01:01:24,952
(sniffing)

863
01:01:34,492 --> 01:01:41,645
Wednesday, July 22nd 1962, The

864
01:01:41,686 --> 01:01:44,745
Afrikaners are breaking
down our house.

865
01:01:44,745 --> 01:01:47,977
Two bulldozers,
and of course the

866
01:01:47,997 --> 01:01:50,483
house crumbled. I felt the pain.

867
01:01:50,731 --> 01:01:53,225
It was my blood, my bones, our

868
01:01:53,266 --> 01:01:55,974
flesh that was
being broken down.

869
01:01:56,182 --> 01:02:00,087
No book can describe,
no poem can describe

870
01:02:00,107 --> 01:02:03,759
the horror, because
our houses were not

871
01:02:03,759 --> 01:02:07,079
houses, they were human beings.

872
01:02:09,461 --> 01:02:15,012
I saw bone and blood
and veins and brains.

873
01:02:21,496 --> 01:02:23,342
And, of course,
when the demolition

874
01:02:23,383 --> 01:02:26,457
finally happens, I
can't even begin to

875
01:02:26,498 --> 01:02:28,370
convey to you the
trauma, you know,

876
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:30,230
and the home is
your sacred space;

877
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:33,678
your whole intimate
sphere is in the house.

878
01:02:33,852 --> 01:02:36,091
Men, women, and
children react very

879
01:02:36,132 --> 01:02:38,995
differently. To the
men it's humiliating;

880
01:02:39,036 --> 01:02:41,068
they can’t protect
their families.

881
01:02:41,123 --> 01:02:43,173
It’s an entire financial loss.

882
01:02:43,748 --> 01:02:46,395
For women, most
Palestinian women

883
01:02:46,436 --> 01:02:48,197
don’t work outside the house.

884
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:53,217
Domestic space is their world,
so when a woman loses that,

885
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:55,600
I’ve seen women
go into states of

886
01:02:55,641 --> 01:02:58,616
mourning. The trauma
is tremendous.

887
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:00,959
The demolition of
a home is really

888
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,878
the demolition of the family.

889
01:03:06,556 --> 01:03:09,281
We estimate that
in East Jerusalem

890
01:03:09,322 --> 01:03:11,361
there are at least 10,000

891
01:03:11,402 --> 01:03:14,285
demolition orders outstanding.
Houses

892
01:03:14,326 --> 01:03:16,387
that can be demolished
at any time.

893
01:03:17,334 --> 01:03:20,043
That doesn’t include
thousands that

894
01:03:20,084 --> 01:03:22,084
have been demolished
inside Israel.

895
01:03:22,678 --> 01:03:26,163
Inside Israel there’s still
a campaign of demolition.

896
01:03:28,131 --> 01:03:32,410
There are about 40,000
homes of Israeli citizens

897
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:35,770
who are Arabs that are
slated for demolition

898
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:38,110
in the next few years,
and this is on the

899
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:41,731
background of 1948
when more than

900
01:03:41,772 --> 01:03:43,904
half the villages of Palestine,

901
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:47,490
more than 400 villages, were
systematically destroyed.

902
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,717
After the state was
created, Israel

903
01:03:50,758 --> 01:03:52,977
continued to forcibly
remove thousands

904
01:03:53,009 --> 01:03:55,397
of its Palestinian
citizens off of their

905
01:03:55,438 --> 01:03:57,904
lands onto small
concentrated areas.

906
01:03:58,149 --> 01:04:02,100
Their villages were bulldozed to
make way for Jewish-only towns.

907
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:05,572
This policy still
continues inside Israel

908
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:08,829
today, with over 45
Palestinian villages

909
01:04:08,829 --> 01:04:10,939
that the government
refuses to recognize,

910
01:04:10,959 --> 01:04:12,784
and which are slated
to be forcibly

911
01:04:12,784 --> 01:04:16,464
removed in order to construct
new Jewish-only towns.

912
01:05:42,409 --> 01:05:45,425
The Apartheid authorities
had what they

913
01:05:45,466 --> 01:05:48,350
called “black spots”.
Incidents where

914
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:52,190
black people were
occupying land where the

915
01:05:52,231 --> 01:05:55,956
white people actually
wanted to occupy.

916
01:05:56,435 --> 01:05:59,058
And what they,
therefore, did was to

917
01:05:59,099 --> 01:06:02,226
send in the police,
send in the military

918
01:06:02,384 --> 01:06:06,305
with heavy trucks to
demolish people's

919
01:06:06,325 --> 01:06:10,164
homes, and then would
remove families

920
01:06:10,164 --> 01:06:13,493
that have been staying
on land for decades

921
01:06:13,513 --> 01:06:16,394
and remove them, and
just dump them.

922
01:06:18,005 --> 01:06:20,441
It was nice in
Sophiatown until the

923
01:06:20,482 --> 01:06:22,987
Afrikaners started harassing us.

924
01:06:24,143 --> 01:06:28,326
They said we are staying too
near to town. We are blacks.

925
01:06:28,326 --> 01:06:30,933
We are not supposed
to stay there, so

926
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:33,650
they started moving
us to Meadowlands.

927
01:06:35,443 --> 01:06:37,917
Because they said we
couldn’t stay near the

928
01:06:37,937 --> 01:06:40,073
white people, so they
must separate us;

929
01:06:40,114 --> 01:06:42,346
we mustn’t be together.
So they take the

930
01:06:42,387 --> 01:06:44,529
place, and they give
it to the whites.

931
01:06:45,917 --> 01:06:47,478
They gave us only
one day’s notice.

932
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:48,705
“Tomorrow you are moving.”

933
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,947
The truck will wait
outside, and then the

934
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:55,005
soldiers will go into
the house, and remove

935
01:06:55,005 --> 01:06:56,919
the furniture into the truck.

936
01:07:00,136 --> 01:07:02,534
(airplane noise and
radio chatter)

937
01:07:11,321 --> 01:07:13,730
Then take the children
and put you in

938
01:07:13,771 --> 01:07:16,199
the truck, and the
mother and father.

939
01:07:17,301 --> 01:07:21,048
They just bulldoze
it to the ground.

940
01:07:21,603 --> 01:07:24,948
They take the family out and
the bulldozer comes.

941
01:07:26,574 --> 01:07:29,613
(shouting)

942
01:07:35,097 --> 01:07:38,941
(crushing noises)

943
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:56,420
Land is more than
just a possession.

944
01:07:56,672 --> 01:08:00,412
Land is something
integrally bound with

945
01:08:00,453 --> 01:08:04,538
your identity. It’s
about your ancestors.

946
01:08:04,579 --> 01:08:07,620
It’s about a sense
of knowing who and

947
01:08:07,661 --> 01:08:10,883
where you are from,
and in South Africa

948
01:08:10,924 --> 01:08:13,451
that’s where the biggest
damage has been done.

949
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:17,324
The removal of
people off the land

950
01:08:17,365 --> 01:08:21,585
and they’re put in these god
forsaken places with nothing,

951
01:08:21,626 --> 01:08:24,240
and they have to start
all over again.

952
01:09:04,752 --> 01:09:09,640
You can shave off my hair.
New hair will grow.

953
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:16,843
You can spit in my face. I
will find water to wash it.

954
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,849
You can take away my
clothes and leave

955
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:22,942
me naked. I will find a blanket.

956
01:09:23,503 --> 01:09:26,553
But if you take
away my house, and

957
01:09:26,594 --> 01:09:30,443
my dignity, where can I go?
Where?

958
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:35,537
There is no pain
quite like being

959
01:09:35,578 --> 01:09:41,560
unloved, unwanted in
one's own land among

960
01:09:41,601 --> 01:09:45,556
one’s own kind.
The Jewish people

961
01:09:46,138 --> 01:09:48,349
come from that experience.

962
01:09:48,733 --> 01:09:52,420
Jews will always have the right,
and I would support that right

963
01:09:52,724 --> 01:09:55,504
for memory and
perpetuation, but now

964
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,506
I feel it for the Palestinians.

965
01:09:58,678 --> 01:10:01,162
I feel it for them,
because they are

966
01:10:01,203 --> 01:10:04,940
stateless, homeless,
vanquished, exiled.

967
01:10:06,993 --> 01:10:12,092
You take away my house;
you take away my dignity.

968
01:10:12,387 --> 01:10:15,107
You take away my love,
and you replace

969
01:10:15,148 --> 01:10:18,957
it with bitterness,
anger, and revenge.

970
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:23,084
(music)

971
01:10:26,326 --> 01:10:28,882
There have been at least 100,000
Palestinians, if not more, that

972
01:10:28,923 --> 01:10:30,746
have gone through
house demolitions.

973
01:10:31,457 --> 01:10:33,669
There’s a psychologist
in Gaza in the

974
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:36,016
Palestinian mental health center

975
01:10:36,057 --> 01:10:40,209
who’s done research that says
that 55% of the suicide bombers

976
01:10:40,646 --> 01:10:42,849
are kids whose houses
have been demolished.

977
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:46,318
The house demolition
issue is one of the

978
01:10:46,359 --> 01:10:49,170
most painful parts
of the occupation.

979
01:10:49,349 --> 01:10:52,616
If you deny Palestinians
a home, and

980
01:10:52,636 --> 01:10:55,912
connected to that is a
concept of homeland,

981
01:10:56,302 --> 01:10:58,629
on two levels you’re
denying them a home, on

982
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:00,890
the individual level and
the collective level.

983
01:11:01,803 --> 01:11:04,138
The term we use
in Hebrew for our

984
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:07,006
form of Apartheid is "nishul".

985
01:11:07,387 --> 01:11:10,787
Nishul means displacement
or dispossession.

986
01:11:11,053 --> 01:11:13,906
That’s the Israeli
form of Apartheid.

987
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:18,537
(music)

988
01:11:35,701 --> 01:11:38,506
(music)

989
01:11:41,467 --> 01:11:43,713
The escalation of
Israeli measures in how

990
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:46,358
they treated the
Palestinians before the

991
01:11:46,358 --> 01:11:48,224
first Intifada, make
it difficult for

992
01:11:48,244 --> 01:11:49,881
the people to accept oppression.

993
01:11:50,164 --> 01:11:54,649
In 1987, as the occupation
rolled into its third decade,

994
01:11:54,649 --> 01:11:58,373
the first Intifada – or
uprising – erupted.

995
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:00,959
People protested,
went on strike,

996
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,976
threw stones,
organized themselves

997
01:12:03,017 --> 01:12:04,695
into groups, and challenged the

998
01:12:04,736 --> 01:12:06,926
Israeli occupation
in different ways.

999
01:12:06,967 --> 01:12:09,528
Things came from
the ground up in

1000
01:12:09,569 --> 01:12:11,701
the first Intifada
where everyone,

1001
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:16,136
no matter who you are, man or
woman, young or old,

1002
01:12:16,136 --> 01:12:17,717
you are connected to certain

1003
01:12:17,737 --> 01:12:19,739
groups, working
in this Intifada.

1004
01:12:19,891 --> 01:12:24,107
It was amazing how the people
were organized.

1005
01:12:27,603 --> 01:12:30,381
The people took a stand.
They had a slogan:

1006
01:12:30,422 --> 01:12:33,748
No taxation without
representation.

1007
01:12:39,709 --> 01:12:41,864
The Israeli occupation
closed down

1008
01:12:41,905 --> 01:12:43,832
all the education institutions

1009
01:12:43,952 --> 01:12:46,372
from the universities to the

1010
01:12:46,431 --> 01:12:49,763
kindergartens for two
and a half years.

1011
01:12:52,795 --> 01:12:55,553
(kids shouting)

1012
01:13:04,741 --> 01:13:07,168
They were very strong
in their reaction.

1013
01:13:08,918 --> 01:13:11,176
(crying)

1014
01:13:11,626 --> 01:13:13,542
The number of the
people that were

1015
01:13:13,562 --> 01:13:15,332
killed, children, youth, women,

1016
01:13:18,192 --> 01:13:22,498
thousands of people were killed.
This was the Israeli reaction.

1017
01:13:24,121 --> 01:13:25,961
If you visit any
family in Palestine,

1018
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:27,323
West Bank, and Gaza Strip,

1019
01:13:27,364 --> 01:13:29,692
you will find at
least one person

1020
01:13:29,733 --> 01:13:34,317
that experienced jail.
To go to jail,

1021
01:13:34,358 --> 01:13:38,581
I don’t want to say it’s
normal, but just being

1022
01:13:38,601 --> 01:13:42,481
Palestinian is reason
enough to be put in jail.

1023
01:13:43,006 --> 01:13:45,492
It’s part of daily
life in Palestine.

1024
01:13:45,867 --> 01:13:51,942
Over 700,000 Palestinians have
experienced jail since 1967.

1025
01:13:53,322 --> 01:13:56,121
Proportionately there
are more political

1026
01:13:56,162 --> 01:14:00,160
prisoners there than
existed in South Africa.

1027
01:14:00,794 --> 01:14:03,387
In South Africa
we had a campaign

1028
01:14:03,428 --> 01:14:05,856
against child detainees.

1029
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:10,098
In Palestine you have over 350

1030
01:14:10,153 --> 01:14:14,199
children who are
political prisoners.

1031
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:16,895
They would take very many of our

1032
01:14:16,936 --> 01:14:22,645
children away from
parents and try

1033
01:14:22,686 --> 01:14:25,971
to use that to coerce parents to

1034
01:14:26,012 --> 01:14:29,562
appear at police
stations to deport.

1035
01:14:31,113 --> 01:14:34,487
I remember in 1988 you
see prisoners coming

1036
01:14:34,528 --> 01:14:36,711
in like crazy. In a
few months we became

1037
01:14:36,711 --> 01:14:43,104
6,000 political prisoners
in one jail. And 95%

1038
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:46,189
of them were under
administrative detention.

1039
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:48,971
Administrative detention
is the detention of

1040
01:14:48,991 --> 01:14:51,151
people, usually for six
months, but you can

1041
01:14:51,151 --> 01:14:56,854
extend it, based on no
legal procedure aside

1042
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:59,215
from issuing an
administrative order.

1043
01:14:59,256 --> 01:15:01,811
People are arrested without
knowing what they are

1044
01:15:01,852 --> 01:15:04,426
in for. They've never been
charged with anything.

1045
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:06,809
The way it’s been done
by Israel is absolutely

1046
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:08,977
in contravention of
international law.

1047
01:15:10,337 --> 01:15:12,872
I remember a famous
Palestinian political

1048
01:15:12,913 --> 01:15:15,291
prisoner in the ‘70s.
He spent around

1049
01:15:15,332 --> 01:15:17,131
seven years under administrative

1050
01:15:17,151 --> 01:15:19,863
detention. It’s
really scary, because

1051
01:15:19,863 --> 01:15:21,329
you don’t know
anything, and they

1052
01:15:21,349 --> 01:15:22,703
use it as part of the torture.

1053
01:15:22,703 --> 01:15:25,312
For example it’s the day
after six months or

1054
01:15:25,332 --> 01:15:28,416
one year in jail, and
this is your last day,

1055
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:32,534
the day you are released.
They come to the jail,

1056
01:15:32,575 --> 01:15:35,508
they call your name. you
collect all your stuff.

1057
01:15:35,508 --> 01:15:37,372
You are released.
You say bye-bye to

1058
01:15:37,392 --> 01:15:39,276
the prisoners, and
you move outside,

1059
01:15:39,276 --> 01:15:41,561
and the officer comes,
“Sorry, another

1060
01:15:41,581 --> 01:15:43,768
six months” and you
go back to jail.

1061
01:15:44,282 --> 01:15:47,766
Administrative detention,
very similar to the

1062
01:15:47,807 --> 01:15:50,931
detention without trial
in South Africa.

1063
01:15:51,192 --> 01:15:52,651
When you are about
to be released,

1064
01:15:52,692 --> 01:15:54,340
they will release you
and let you walk

1065
01:15:54,381 --> 01:15:56,502
a few steps and re-arrest you.
Which is,

1066
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:58,382
by the way, is another
form of torture,

1067
01:15:58,382 --> 01:16:01,051
because you never
actually are sure as

1068
01:16:01,092 --> 01:16:04,895
to whether you will
be totally released.

1069
01:16:06,113 --> 01:16:11,877
I was arrested in 1985,
and there was nothing

1070
01:16:11,918 --> 01:16:14,934
illegal about what it
was that I was doing,

1071
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:18,043
and they knew that they could,
therefore, not take me to court

1072
01:16:18,347 --> 01:16:21,620
and charge me with anything.
They basically

1073
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:24,484
detained us because
they could do it.

1074
01:16:25,511 --> 01:16:27,861
Why did Mandela become the hero

1075
01:16:27,902 --> 01:16:30,168
of the political
prisoners issue?

1076
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:33,222
He spent 27 years
in the Apartheid

1077
01:16:33,242 --> 01:16:36,842
system jail. Right now
we have prisoners

1078
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,614
that have spent
more than 30 years

1079
01:16:38,655 --> 01:16:40,668
in jail, more than Mandela.

1080
01:16:42,245 --> 01:16:46,168
Why doesn’t the international
community pay attention to that?

1081
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:49,270
(gunshots)

1082
01:16:57,243 --> 01:17:00,254
Within one year of each
other, both Israel and

1083
01:17:00,295 --> 01:17:03,365
South Africa launched
“Operation Iron Fist”,

1084
01:17:03,406 --> 01:17:06,239
brutal and overwhelming
campaigns to crush

1085
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,933
opposition to their
respective polices.

1086
01:17:09,055 --> 01:17:11,405
With the “Iron Fist”
policy, they used

1087
01:17:11,511 --> 01:17:14,533
to open the handcuffs
and take people's

1088
01:17:14,574 --> 01:17:18,325
arms like this and break the
bone in this way.

1089
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:28,285
I still remember the sound of my
friend when they broke his arm.

1090
01:17:28,385 --> 01:17:33,512
The sound is still in my ear.
I will never ever forget that.

1091
01:17:43,138 --> 01:17:49,963
They went as far as killing very
many of our comrades brutally,

1092
01:17:50,268 --> 01:17:53,700
acts that you can never imagine.

1093
01:17:58,717 --> 01:18:01,547
The South African
Defense Forces, as they

1094
01:18:01,588 --> 01:18:05,082
were called, their army
and navy was almost

1095
01:18:05,123 --> 01:18:08,267
totally outfitted by
Israel, because South

1096
01:18:08,287 --> 01:18:11,157
Africa couldn't get
weapons from other

1097
01:18:11,157 --> 01:18:13,922
countries. Israel
was one of the only

1098
01:18:13,942 --> 01:18:17,059
countries willing to
break the arms embargo.

1099
01:18:17,188 --> 01:18:20,145
Well, the alliance
started in earnest

1100
01:18:20,186 --> 01:18:25,672
in 1973. By 1979, 35%
of Israel's arms

1101
01:18:25,713 --> 01:18:27,934
exports were going to
South Africa, so they

1102
01:18:27,975 --> 01:18:30,189
became a crucial
client, and a crucial

1103
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:33,349
source for export revenue that
Israel couldn’t give up easily.

1104
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:35,232
It involved everything
from tanks to

1105
01:18:35,273 --> 01:18:37,059
aircraft to ammunition
and you name it.

1106
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:39,913
After 1977 there’s
a mandatory U.N.

1107
01:18:39,954 --> 01:18:42,961
arms embargo.
Israel violated the

1108
01:18:43,002 --> 01:18:46,828
U.N. arms embargo openly,
and many Israeli

1109
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:49,978
officials are happy
to admit that.

1110
01:18:49,978 --> 01:18:51,378
If you talk to South
African defense

1111
01:18:51,398 --> 01:18:52,856
officials, especially
people from the

1112
01:18:52,856 --> 01:18:54,504
air force, they tell you that

1113
01:18:54,545 --> 01:18:56,884
Israel was an
absolutely vital link

1114
01:18:56,925 --> 01:18:59,998
and was a lifeline for them
during the 1980s.

1115
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:06,973
After 1977, the ideological
component becomes much stronger.

1116
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:09,053
The top brass of the
two militaries really

1117
01:19:09,094 --> 01:19:11,032
felt that they were in
a similar predicament

1118
01:19:11,073 --> 01:19:14,965
and that they faced a
common enemy. They also

1119
01:19:15,006 --> 01:19:18,882
had a very similar
conception of minority

1120
01:19:18,923 --> 01:19:21,895
survival. They felt
that Afrikaner

1121
01:19:21,936 --> 01:19:25,270
nationalists were
similar to Israelis,

1122
01:19:25,311 --> 01:19:28,289
beleaguered
minorities surrounded

1123
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,358
by a hostile majority.

1124
01:19:31,848 --> 01:19:34,619
If you look at the
documents from the South

1125
01:19:34,639 --> 01:19:38,585
African defense archive,
you see dozens of

1126
01:19:38,585 --> 01:19:40,537
South Africans were
going to Israel on a

1127
01:19:40,557 --> 01:19:42,721
regular basis to attend
a variety of courses

1128
01:19:42,721 --> 01:19:45,943
that involved submarine
operation, anti-tank

1129
01:19:45,963 --> 01:19:48,988
technology, counterinsurgency
techniques,

1130
01:19:48,988 --> 01:19:51,473
you name it. They
really see the PLO

1131
01:19:51,493 --> 01:19:53,660
and the ANC as one in the same.

1132
01:19:53,788 --> 01:19:58,821
The reaction of the government
ordering a general mobilization,

1133
01:19:59,197 --> 01:20:01,561
arming the white
community, arresting

1134
01:20:01,581 --> 01:20:03,526
tens of thousands of Africans,

1135
01:20:03,526 --> 01:20:06,382
a show of force
throughout the country,

1136
01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:09,206
closed a chapter as
far as our methods

1137
01:20:09,206 --> 01:20:11,067
of political struggle
are concerned.

1138
01:20:12,111 --> 01:20:15,285
There are many people
who feel that it

1139
01:20:15,305 --> 01:20:18,662
is useless and futile
for us to continue

1140
01:20:18,662 --> 01:20:21,098
talking peace and
nonviolence against

1141
01:20:21,139 --> 01:20:23,524
a government whose reply is only

1142
01:20:23,565 --> 01:20:28,450
savage attacks on an unarmed
and defenseless people.

1143
01:20:28,984 --> 01:20:30,665
"Bombs have exploded
almost daily

1144
01:20:30,706 --> 01:20:32,457
in the run-up to
Wednesday’s poll,

1145
01:20:32,498 --> 01:20:34,364
the latest a huge
car bomb, which

1146
01:20:34,405 --> 01:20:36,694
devastated shops in
the central town

1147
01:20:36,735 --> 01:20:39,096
of Witbank. The blasts
have been officially

1148
01:20:39,116 --> 01:20:41,389
blamed on the African
National Congress".

1149
01:20:41,895 --> 01:20:44,301
After decades of
non-violent struggle,

1150
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,959
Nelson Mandela formed
the armed wing

1151
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,483
of the African
National Congress.

1152
01:20:49,524 --> 01:20:52,175
They turned first
to sabotage, then

1153
01:20:52,175 --> 01:20:54,668
to civilian bombings
in order to have

1154
01:20:54,709 --> 01:20:57,512
their political
aspirations recognized.

1155
01:20:57,848 --> 01:21:00,312
"If this was the work
of the ANC, it’s their

1156
01:21:00,353 --> 01:21:02,837
boldest attack to date,
and demonstrates the

1157
01:21:02,878 --> 01:21:06,215
organization’s determination
to carry the guerilla

1158
01:21:06,256 --> 01:21:08,933
war to South Africa's
major city centers."

1159
01:21:10,981 --> 01:21:13,614
(music)

1160
01:21:16,769 --> 01:21:18,669
"The explosion
tore apart the bus

1161
01:21:18,689 --> 01:21:20,496
in the very heart of Jerusalem,

1162
01:21:20,496 --> 01:21:23,234
killing many of those on board.
It was the

1163
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:26,011
mirror image of last
week’s suicide bomb."

1164
01:21:26,162 --> 01:21:30,004
I am pained when I
read the story of a

1165
01:21:30,045 --> 01:21:35,020
65-year-old Palestinian
woman who became

1166
01:21:35,061 --> 01:21:38,637
the carrier of a
suicide bomb, and in a

1167
01:21:38,703 --> 01:21:42,569
note she indicated that
she had to do that

1168
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:45,948
because she was
trying to save her

1169
01:21:45,989 --> 01:21:48,450
grandchildren from being killed,

1170
01:21:48,705 --> 01:21:53,596
and we’re saying what unfair
choices to put before people.

1171
01:21:56,614 --> 01:21:59,356
(music)

1172
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:07,160
Security and terrorism
are important issues,

1173
01:22:07,201 --> 01:22:10,700
but they’re symptoms.
They’re not independent

1174
01:22:10,741 --> 01:22:14,409
variables. Israel is
the strong party. Once

1175
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:17,301
you bring the occupation
into the picture,

1176
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:20,441
there isn’t any more symmetry.
There’s no

1177
01:22:20,461 --> 01:22:23,338
more both sides—us
and them—the balance

1178
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:25,372
that everybody loves.
Palestinians

1179
01:22:25,392 --> 01:22:26,976
aren’t occupying Tel Aviv.

1180
01:22:27,659 --> 01:22:30,011
We are pleading that we do not

1181
01:22:30,052 --> 01:22:32,399
wait for more people
to be killed.

1182
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:35,773
It is quite apparent
that the political

1183
01:22:35,814 --> 01:22:38,856
authorities will on
their own not act.

1184
01:22:38,897 --> 01:22:41,697
We need to pressurize them.

1185
01:22:42,778 --> 01:22:45,645
(singing)

1186
01:23:04,203 --> 01:23:07,680
(singing)

1187
01:23:15,373 --> 01:23:17,939
Despite all this
repressive machinery,

1188
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:20,678
there’s a general kind
of agreement that

1189
01:23:20,678 --> 01:23:23,276
it was the international
dimension and the

1190
01:23:23,296 --> 01:23:25,732
internal resistance,
the South African

1191
01:23:25,732 --> 01:23:28,031
Intifada, if you
like, that really

1192
01:23:28,051 --> 01:23:29,765
brought an end to Apartheid.

1193
01:23:29,806 --> 01:23:31,901
You had a mass of
people, people’s

1194
01:23:31,942 --> 01:23:34,831
movements, and resistance
organizations etc.

1195
01:23:34,872 --> 01:23:37,226
that were in terms
of numbers of people

1196
01:23:37,267 --> 01:23:40,617
quite large, but
weak, taking on very

1197
01:23:40,658 --> 01:23:42,796
sophisticated structures
of repression.

1198
01:23:42,837 --> 01:23:44,775
So, a really
powerful opponent on

1199
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:47,648
one hand, and a weak
one on the other.

1200
01:23:48,679 --> 01:23:51,832
It was the international
isolation campaign

1201
01:23:51,832 --> 01:23:55,521
that brought a sense of balance
between the two.

1202
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:01,945
At that point, the South
Africans actually

1203
01:24:01,986 --> 01:24:05,054
seek out advice
from the Israelis

1204
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:06,907
on how to sell themselves in the

1205
01:24:06,948 --> 01:24:08,835
West and how to
improve their image.

1206
01:24:08,876 --> 01:24:12,511
The South Africans
looked to Israel as a

1207
01:24:12,552 --> 01:24:16,175
sort of beacon, and
they didn't understand

1208
01:24:16,175 --> 01:24:19,178
why Israel had
managed to withstand

1209
01:24:19,198 --> 01:24:22,138
criticism for decades
and survive,

1210
01:24:22,138 --> 01:24:24,624
and why South
Africa was failing.

1211
01:24:26,172 --> 01:24:29,499
A lot of Israelis fear
that they may one

1212
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:31,921
day be delegitimized
in the same way

1213
01:24:31,962 --> 01:24:33,442
South Africa was.

1214
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:39,046
(hip-hop music)

1215
01:25:16,843 --> 01:25:18,450
What we would like
is for the public

1216
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:20,097
to realize that they
actually have a

1217
01:25:20,097 --> 01:25:21,710
real positive role to play. They

1218
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:23,516
can actually boycott
these goods,

1219
01:25:23,516 --> 01:25:25,928
and we’re only individuals, but

1220
01:25:25,948 --> 01:25:28,694
together when we
act holistically

1221
01:25:28,694 --> 01:25:30,328
such as the protest
today, and even

1222
01:25:30,348 --> 01:25:31,957
on an individual
day-to-day basis,

1223
01:25:31,957 --> 01:25:33,930
we can have a real
impact in challenging

1224
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:35,935
the occupation on a
long-term level.

1225
01:25:36,135 --> 01:25:38,951
The global call came in
2005 from Palestinian

1226
01:25:38,992 --> 01:25:41,849
civil society
organizations, and the idea

1227
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:44,786
was to craft a strategy
that would be a

1228
01:25:44,827 --> 01:25:47,810
non-violent means of
pressuring Israel

1229
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:51,068
to abide by international law
using economic pressure.

1230
01:25:51,109 --> 01:25:53,385
These campaigns are taking root.
They’re

1231
01:25:53,426 --> 01:25:55,141
gaining new
supporters every day.

1232
01:25:55,141 --> 01:25:57,575
The churches have taken
the lead in saying,

1233
01:25:57,629 --> 01:26:00,251
“We want socially
responsible investment,

1234
01:26:00,509 --> 01:26:02,329
and that means we
want to be sure that

1235
01:26:02,349 --> 01:26:04,001
none of the companies
we invest in

1236
01:26:04,001 --> 01:26:05,927
are profiting from occupation.”

1237
01:26:06,008 --> 01:26:08,694
There are many, many,
many initiatives going

1238
01:26:08,735 --> 01:26:11,502
around the world for
boycotting Israeli goods

1239
01:26:11,543 --> 01:26:13,700
boycotting Israeli
institutions and so on,

1240
01:26:13,741 --> 01:26:15,803
so it’s growing, in the
cultural, academic,

1241
01:26:15,926 --> 01:26:19,004
medical, even trade unions.
In South

1242
01:26:19,024 --> 01:26:22,039
Africa COSATU, the
main trade union

1243
01:26:22,039 --> 01:26:24,040
body in South Africa,
which has about 2

1244
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,081
million members,
supported the boycott.

1245
01:26:26,081 --> 01:26:28,207
There are so many.
They’re mushrooming

1246
01:26:28,227 --> 01:26:29,878
really in the last two years.

1247
01:26:31,993 --> 01:26:34,889
This is happening more and more.
In North

1248
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:37,430
America you have
the Canadian union

1249
01:26:37,471 --> 01:26:40,775
of postal workers.
Prior to that, the

1250
01:26:40,795 --> 01:26:43,595
Canadian union of
public employees.

1251
01:26:45,569 --> 01:26:48,901
The incredible growing
movement, I mean, I’ve

1252
01:26:48,921 --> 01:26:51,908
traveled to literally
dozens of campuses

1253
01:26:51,908 --> 01:26:55,377
around the United
States, and there

1254
01:26:55,418 --> 01:26:58,668
are active divestment groups.

1255
01:26:58,768 --> 01:27:01,985
There are church
divestment movements that

1256
01:27:02,076 --> 01:27:04,986
are starting and really
gaining strength,

1257
01:27:05,027 --> 01:27:07,737
and facing incredible
resistance, but

1258
01:27:07,778 --> 01:27:09,855
they’re not being
deterred by it.

1259
01:27:10,034 --> 01:27:11,666
As our South African
comrades and

1260
01:27:11,707 --> 01:27:13,844
colleagues remind us,
their first call for

1261
01:27:13,885 --> 01:27:17,260
boycott was issued
in the late 1950s.

1262
01:27:17,377 --> 01:27:19,622
Europe and the West
started listening

1263
01:27:19,622 --> 01:27:22,116
in the ‘70s, early
‘80s, so it took them

1264
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:24,541
30 years to get anybody
to listen to them.

1265
01:27:24,584 --> 01:27:26,522
So we’re doing much
better they tell us.

1266
01:27:26,563 --> 01:27:28,378
You’re going much
faster than we did.

1267
01:27:30,994 --> 01:27:34,517
(hip-hop music)

1268
01:27:58,638 --> 01:28:05,830
The idea of a one-state solution
begins with the notion that

1269
01:28:06,408 --> 01:28:10,062
no matter how they
got there, no matter

1270
01:28:10,103 --> 01:28:13,416
the competing
historical narratives,

1271
01:28:13,775 --> 01:28:16,267
the country belongs to all who
live in it.

1272
01:28:16,484 --> 01:28:20,650
Let 100% of the people
live in 100% of the land,

1273
01:28:20,744 --> 01:28:24,225
Since nobody can agree
on how to divide it.

1274
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:26,900
Israel’s going to
have to stop being a

1275
01:28:26,941 --> 01:28:29,713
Jewish state. It can't
be an ethnocracy,

1276
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:32,376
and it has to become
a democracy, whether

1277
01:28:32,396 --> 01:28:34,567
it’s a one-state or
a confederation,

1278
01:28:34,567 --> 01:28:36,532
or whatever the
arrangement is, that’s

1279
01:28:36,552 --> 01:28:38,181
what’s going to have to happen.

1280
01:28:38,181 --> 01:28:40,689
And it doesn’t mean,
I try to tell

1281
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:44,845
Israelis, that
everything’s lost.

1282
01:28:44,993 --> 01:28:48,286
In South Africa, people
still talk Afrikaans.

1283
01:28:48,327 --> 01:28:50,963
They still have an
Afrikaner university.

1284
01:28:50,963 --> 01:28:54,595
You know, nobody’s going to stop
speaking Hebrew here.

1285
01:28:54,874 --> 01:28:56,566
You’re restructuring.
It’ll be in a

1286
01:28:56,607 --> 01:28:58,369
different, healthier
environment.

1287
01:28:58,410 --> 01:29:01,641
That's the challange, That’s why
I like this one-state idea.

1288
01:29:02,244 --> 01:29:04,174
You know, it wasn’t
only blacks who

1289
01:29:04,215 --> 01:29:06,234
were freed when Apartheid ended.

1290
01:29:06,275 --> 01:29:08,853
I was freed. We all were freed.
We were

1291
01:29:08,894 --> 01:29:12,321
liberated from this
terrible corrosive

1292
01:29:12,362 --> 01:29:17,067
vision of trying to build an
ethnically pure state.

1293
01:29:17,403 --> 01:29:22,700
And decades of Apartheid regime
propaganda, like decades of

1294
01:29:22,741 --> 01:29:26,694
Zionist propaganda,
said to the people: “If

1295
01:29:26,735 --> 01:29:30,135
you give up control,
you will be devoured.

1296
01:29:30,176 --> 01:29:32,792
You will be thrown into the sea.
You will be killed.”

1297
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:35,869
And so it was very
important for the

1298
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:40,148
anti-Apartheid
movement to offer to

1299
01:29:40,189 --> 01:29:43,920
ordinary white citizens
a credible alternative

1300
01:29:43,961 --> 01:29:48,003
message. To say: “You
will not be devoured.

1301
01:29:48,003 --> 01:29:52,016
You give up the system, and you
will have a place in the future,

1302
01:29:52,016 --> 01:29:53,869
and it’s an inclusive future.”

1303
01:29:57,119 --> 01:29:59,154
There’s already a one-state.
It’s already

1304
01:29:59,195 --> 01:30:01,103
one state, but it’s
a one-state living

1305
01:30:01,144 --> 01:30:03,943
under Apartheid. It’s
how to transform it

1306
01:30:03,984 --> 01:30:06,533
from Apartheid to
democracy where people

1307
01:30:06,533 --> 01:30:09,267
get equal rights based
on citizenship, not on

1308
01:30:09,308 --> 01:30:12,736
ethnicity, religion, gender,
or any other identity.

1309
01:30:15,033 --> 01:30:18,118
(singing)

1310
01:30:23,537 --> 01:30:26,939
In South Africa saying
that the country

1311
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:29,709
belongs to all who
live in it doesn't

1312
01:30:29,709 --> 01:30:32,961
magically solve the problems.
There are

1313
01:30:33,002 --> 01:30:35,782
still massive political
struggles in South

1314
01:30:35,782 --> 01:30:38,967
Africa over resource
allocation, over

1315
01:30:38,987 --> 01:30:42,277
the speed of land
reform, the speed of

1316
01:30:42,277 --> 01:30:45,442
economic reform, over
affirmative action.

1317
01:30:48,078 --> 01:30:50,705
Those struggles for
social justice

1318
01:30:50,875 --> 01:30:53,760
continue, but they have to start

1319
01:30:53,801 --> 01:30:58,064
from the premise that everyone
is entitled to equal rights.

1320
01:30:58,164 --> 01:31:01,139
But you know the world
doesn’t stand still.

1321
01:31:01,705 --> 01:31:04,775
There are people I meet
today in South Africa

1322
01:31:04,775 --> 01:31:07,092
who don’t understand
what Apartheid

1323
01:31:07,112 --> 01:31:09,124
was about. They've come into a

1324
01:31:09,124 --> 01:31:12,550
whole new world, so
it’s not impossible

1325
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:15,240
to think of other generations.

1326
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:18,858
We must have the ability
to think beyond our

1327
01:31:18,878 --> 01:31:21,970
own generation, to
think into the future.

1328
01:31:23,904 --> 01:31:26,181
What does it matter
if a man is white

1329
01:31:26,222 --> 01:31:30,517
or black? What does
it matter if he’s

1330
01:31:30,558 --> 01:31:35,775
a Jew or he’s an Arab?
It is possible.

1331
01:31:35,881 --> 01:31:38,628
Israel, it is possible.

1332
01:31:38,816 --> 01:31:44,830
It is possible to have peace
with Jews and Arabs

1333
01:31:44,952 --> 01:31:49,572
if the heart is ready,
if the soul is ready,

1334
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:57,612
if we can transcend these petty
foibles of power and pomposity,

1335
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:01,939
and we say to this world: “It
is possible.”

1336
01:32:04,391 --> 01:32:06,111
It is possible.
