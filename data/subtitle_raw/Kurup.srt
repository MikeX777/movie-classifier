1
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,666
Good morning. I will be right there.

2
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:15,250
-Manju?
-Sir?

3
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,541
-Is Mr. Krishnadas here?
-Yes, sir. He is in the office.

4
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,583
Sir.

5
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,416
Yes.

6
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,125
-Sir, shall I pack these as well?
-Sure.

7
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:11,458
Sir, there is information from the IB
that a criminal might enter via our coast.

8
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,083
The fax will arrive shortly.

9
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,958
Sir, we need to strengthen
the coastal region.

10
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,833
So, it would be great
if you could issue an order.

11
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,458
I've been doing this
for more than 30 years.

12
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,041
Now it's up to guys
like you to give orders.

13
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,458
Sir?

14
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,333
I think you forgot about it.

15
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,250
I retired yesterday.

16
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,541
Everything is ready, sir.

17
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,208
-Tell them I'm coming.
-Okay, sir.

18
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,791
-What happened?
-Sorry, sir.

19
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,208
As far as each one of us is concerned,

20
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,541
this is a day that we can't avoid.

21
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:23,166
The day when we leave behind
our official life for our retired life.

22
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,416
Today, our respected Mr. Krishnadas

23
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,458
will bid farewell to us.

24
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,458
He is the perfect example for how

25
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,250
an investigating officer should be.

26
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,041
In the course of his official life,

27
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,250
he has witnessed many developments

28
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,708
and investigated many cases.

29
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,708
But when we look back on his career

30
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:51,250
the first thing that comes to
our mind is the Charlie case…

31
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,666
and fugitive Kurup.

32
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,875
It would have been
dismissed as an accident case.

33
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,833
But with his analytical skills,

34
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:05,125
he was able to solve
the mystery behind it.

35
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,583
KURUP

36
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:03,208
FROM CHERIYANAAD TO MADRAS

37
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,791
Don't break it again.

38
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,875
When did you come, Brother-in-law?

39
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,250
I couldn't stay back when

40
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,708
-I heard about Gopikrishnan.
-Sharada, give it to everyone?

41
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:31,708
That's why I came here.

42
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,666
I knew that my son

43
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,541
-will pass with flying colors.
-Shut up!

44
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,291
Don't you feel ashamed to brag about it?

45
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,291
What are you saying?

46
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,333
After all, Gopi got a seat in PUC.

47
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,958
Why do you feel ashamed, brother-in-law?

48
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,916
Where is the first class seat holder?

49
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He went to college to
enroll for degree course.

50
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,750
So, he went to college
to enroll for degree!

51
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,791
My dear, your eldest son,

52
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,958
Mr. Gopikrishna Kurup

53
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,666
flunked the PUC exams.

54
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:04,875
-What?
-What?

55
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,833
How can he join army at such a young age?

56
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,125
It's not army.

57
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,333
It's the Indian Air force.

58
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,041
Also, one doesn't join the air force.

59
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,666
They decide who joins them.

60
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,875
You were an army man.
Tell her how it works.

61
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,083
What if he gets into
trouble and ends up in jail?

62
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,083
We will be humiliated.

63
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,916
He doesn't need to join the
air force to end up in jail.

64
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,208
Don't worry about it.

65
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,166
Just imagine our Gopi
in an air force uniform!

66
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,875
He will look so smart.

67
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,166
That's all you need to think right now.

68
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,458
-Isn't Gopi home yet?
-I don't know.

69
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,750
Maybe he will show up
with a degree certificate.

70
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,000
He can't pull off his
tricks there, Gomathi.

71
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,125
It's the air force, after all.

72
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,500
The Indian Air force.

73
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:21,250
RECOLLECTIONS BY PETER

74
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,375
Stop talking and go in there now.

75
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,875
I wonder what terror awaits me here.

76
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:44,916
Here you go.

77
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,791
Hey!

78
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,750
-Hello!
-Where are you going?

79
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,041
Where are you off to?

80
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,083
Don't you see the queue?

81
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,458
Bloody Indians!

82
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,500
Who say that?

83
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,958
And now he is showing off!

84
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,416
I say who say that!

85
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,583
You!

86
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,166
Shoe not polished.

87
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,666
This is how you stand in air force camp!

88
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,083
Do you know the meaning of decorum?

89
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,583
Sorry, sir.

90
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,791
Everybody… fall-in in threes.

91
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,583
In three lines!

92
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,375
Come!

93
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:56,958
Attention!

94
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,291
Stand at ease.

95
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,375
"Abranjan!"

96
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,208
Don't know "abranjan"?

97
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,000
Useless fellows!

98
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:09,916
Hands out.

99
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,000
Sitting position.

100
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:14,875
Good!

101
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,250
-Sir, coffee.
-Stand at ease.

102
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,625
-Murthy?
-Sir?

103
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,458
-"Abranjan!"
-Who is that bloody idiot?

104
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,375
Stand at ease!

105
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,250
"Abranjan."

106
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,458
-Good!
-Sir is calling you.

107
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,083
Attention!

108
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,291
-Sir is calling you.
-Yes.

109
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,333
-You, take position! Do drill.
-Sir.

110
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,208
Attention.

111
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,666
Stand at ease.

112
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,833
"Abranjan!"

113
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,000
Sir?

114
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,875
-Who are you?
-Sir, myself Gopikrishnan.

115
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,541
-Coming from--
-I don't think you belong here.

116
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,875
No, sir. I mean, yes, sir.

117
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,083
I finished the written test, sir.
Third attempt.

118
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,125
-Now medical test, sir.
-Why are you here?

119
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,791
-Sir, medical test.
-No.

120
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,791
I asked, why Indian Air force?

121
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,041
To fly, sir.

122
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:16,875
Stand at ease!

123
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,416
You can do it right here.

124
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,083
-Anand?
-Sir?

125
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,791
-Teach him how to fly.
-Yes, sir.

126
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,208
Until I say. Get out!

127
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,875
Attention! "Abranjan."

128
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,708
Stand at ease!

129
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:29,875
Here.

130
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:30,916
Attention!

131
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,041
-Sir?
-Fly.

132
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,750
-Fly, sir?
-Stand at ease!

133
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:34,833
Fly.

134
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,166
Attention.

135
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,666
Stand at ease.

136
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,250
-Is this okay, sir?
-Attention!

137
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,083
Stand at ease.

138
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,833
Let your bloody legs also fly high!

139
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,583
Legs.

140
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,166
Okay, sir.

141
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,458
Back to line.

142
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,375
<i>The prestigious Indian Air force.</i>

143
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,375

144
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,708
<i>My father has no taste in art.</i>
<i>I just obeyed his command</i>

RIP!

149
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,500
<i>Then we have Surjit Singh</i>

<i>Meet the Great "Gopikrishnan."</i>

157
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,291
Hello!

158
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:55,916
"Abranjan."

159
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,583
-Hey, Peter! Wake up.
-What is it?

160
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,083
Switch off the lights and
go back to sleep!

161
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,625
Hey, try knocking again.

162
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,916
Come on, boys! Come on!

163
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,458
Hey, Peter!

164
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,291
You bloody idiot!
Take your position.

165
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,583
Get up!

166
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,500
How dare you sleep during the parade!

167
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,875
-Come on, get up!
-Don't hit me.

168
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,500
-Who the hell will fetch the shoe?
-No!

169
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,000
-Take it!
-I'll take it, sir!

170
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,916
Come on! Get going!

171
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,375
Do you come here to sleep?

172
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,750
-No, sir, I…
-I will be screwed!

173
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,083
You have become airmen.

174
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:25,458
An airman always should be
physically fit and mentally agile.

175
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,625
-And here-- GK!
-Sir! Yes, sir.

176
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,666
-Sleeping in the classroom?
-Yes, sir.

177
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,625
Get out of my classroom!

178
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,541
And 20 rounds in the airfield!

179
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,375
Hey! Where is it?

180
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,500
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Hey!

181
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,375
-Did you see my bedsheet?
-I can't even find my own.

182
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,291
-What?
-It's missing.

183
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:09,083
General salute!

184
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,000
-Hey!
-Sir?

185
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,791
-Why are you late?
-Sorry, sir.

186
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,916
-Bathroom, sir.
-See, Mr. Gopikrishnan Pillai…

187
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,958
this is an airman training school.

188
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,041
-Don't make it an animal training school.
-Sir.

189
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,416
-Sorry, sir.
-Twenty rounds around the airfield.

190
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,833
-And right time for the class.
-One!

191
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,625
Peter, look straight.
Lift the rifle higher.

192
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:36,833
Proper.

193
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,000
-Where are you off to?
-Dinner, sir.

194
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,041
-What time is your dinner?
-Seven o'clock, sir.

195
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,333
What is the time right now?

196
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,416
-7:03 p.m. sir.
-Why are you late?

197
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,791
Evening punishment, sir.
50 rounds.

198
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,666
For the bloody three minutes,
three hours in the ground!

199
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,750
Get into the rooster position.

200
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,458
Sir, I already completed one punishment.

201
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:12,833
Sorry, sir.

202
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,791
Welcome to animal training school.

203
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,875
Take your position for next three hours.

204
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,083
-Anand.
-Sir.

205
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,500
Take the position.

206
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,666
Take proper rooster position.
Lift your buttocks.

207
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,166
-Stay right there.
-Yes, sir.

208
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,041
Sir!

209
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,875
He is also late, sir.

210
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,875
To heck with you, Gopi!

211
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,208
-Look at them.
-Hey, dude!

212
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,375
What are you staring at?
Go to your dormantry.

213
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:55,000
<i>Peter darling, hope the winds</i>
<i>are favorable to your aircraft.</i>

214
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,000
<i>We Mustangs are coming to the</i>
<i>MCC to rock the brains out on the 20th.</i>

215
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,000
<i>Indie Rock Festival it is!</i>

216
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,958
<i>The void you made after</i>
<i>your take-off is yet to be filled</i>

217
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,916
<i>and will always remain vacant.</i>

218
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:10,041
<i>Since you are near, we hope we can</i>
<i>perform together towards awesomeness.</i>

219
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,583
<i>Waiting for your landing there.</i>

220
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,458
<i>Fly and come buddy! With love, M.</i>

221
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,750
Hey, come on up!

222
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,333
Hey, this is my bedsheet.

223
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,375
Come quickly!

224
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,458
You are…

225
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,250
GK?

226
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,541
-It's you!
-Yes, Peter Pan.

227
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:56,750
What are you up to this time?

228
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,666
Don't you want to go to your big event?

229
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,458
Come on.

230
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,500
-Where are you taking me?
-Be quiet.

231
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,833
Someone will hear us.

232
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,916
So this is your bed bug in the air force!

233
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,000
GK, where are we going?

234
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,208
-Hi!
-Hi!

235
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,291
-All good?
-Absolutely.

236
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,541
-Hi, Chandan.
-Hello.

237
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,500
-Who are these guys?
-Old friends.

238
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,916
Jimmy.

239
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,791
-I need your help.
-Tell me.

240
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,791
-Okay.
-Thank you, bro.

241
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,208
-Love birds, please give way.
-GK!

242
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,666
-Keep going!
-One second.

243
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,583
-We are here.
-GK!

244
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,166
Hi, everybody! There is a surprise.

245
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,208
Our beloved friend, Mr. Peter.

246
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,000
He is here. We really miss your string.

247
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,625
Come on to the stage.

248
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,791
Right now.

249
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,916
Peter George!

250
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,250
Thank you!

251
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,833
Thank you so much for the warm welcome.

252
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,208
I'm here just because
of my new friend, GK!

253
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,500
Where is GK?

254
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,250
He will screw up. I'll be right back.

255
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,625
-Go, man!
-GK!

256
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,833
-Excuse me.
-One minute.

257
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,541
May I borrow this?

258
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,208
-Hey, what is this?
-What are you doing?

259
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,708
GK, what are you doing?

260
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,125
<i>See where the world is going</i>
<i>My Susie darling</i>

261
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:32,208
<i>See where the world is going</i>
<i>My Susie darling</i>

262
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,166
One, two…

263
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,291
One, two, three. Go!

264
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:39,875
<i>There is a girl next door called Rosie</i>

265
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,916
<i>Looks like she's on the disco floor</i>

266
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:48,291
<i>In her bell-bottoms and high heels</i>

267
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,375
<i>The girl trots like a horse on wheels</i>

268
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:06,708
<i>When I went to England one time</i>

269
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:10,583
<i>I fell in love with a madam for a time</i>

270
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:14,541
<i>Then I returned home</i>

271
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:18,500
<i>I passed that love to Rosie nearby</i>

272
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:23,083
<i>While madam butters her bread</i>

273
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:26,500
<i>For breakfast everyday</i>

274
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:30,958
<i>While madam butters her bread</i>

275
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:34,958
<i>For breakfast everyday</i>

276
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,583
<i>Rosie has stewed cassava</i>

277
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,458
<i>With sardine curry to begin the day</i>

278
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,625
<i>Rosie has stewed cassava</i>

279
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,291
<i>With sardine curry to begin the day</i>

280
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,000
Hey, stop the music!

281
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:46,916
Hi, boys.

282
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,875
-Hi, sir.
-Hi, sir.

283
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,791
-Jai Hind, sir!
-Sir.

284
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,125
Hey, Dominique.
Sir is here.

285
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,250
Thank you.

286
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:53,583
Jai Hind, sir.

287
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:54,666
Cheers!

288
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,833
Sir?

289
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,291
Cheers!

290
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,958
-Peter?
-Sir.

291
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,041
Peter George.

292
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,791
-I see a vibrant future in you.
-Thank you, sir.

293
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,375
But what surprises me is…

294
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:12,541
why hasn't your friend here quit yet?

295
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:18,291
Sir… I came here so I
can succeed in life.

296
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,166
Sooner or later, I will.

297
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:22,333
Really?

298
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:25,416
Listen carefully.

299
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,291
I have a surprise for you in Bombay.

300
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,416
Get ready for that, chap.

301
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:34,083
Sir, with your guidance, always ready.

302
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,041
Let us see. Cheers!

303
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,375
Cheers!

304
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:41,500
-Oh, come on!
-What?

305
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:42,958
Music!

306
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:53,833
Kumarasamy!

307
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:13,083
<i>A new sky, a new earth and a new world.</i>

308
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:19,000
Where the scents of dream, loss,
love and vengeance waft by at once.

309
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:21,625
The exquisite city of dreams and desire.

310
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:24,333
As someone once said "Amchi Mumbai".

311
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:39,958
Each of you will go to the
billet assigned to your trade.

312
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:43,666
Report to the base
station at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

313
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:47,375
The information of the billets is on
the notice board in the corridor.

314
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:48,791
Come on.

315
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,708
Let's go. Alpha is this way.

316
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:59,000
Billet three for accounts is over there.

317
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,875
<i>GK was right.</i>

318
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,416
<i>It's easy to give up when you lose.</i>

319
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:15,958
<i>The difficult part is to</i>
<i>prove that you can win.</i>

320
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:32,625
<i>The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971</i>

321
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:36,291
<i>groomed the airman in me.</i>

322
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:47,000
<i>Just like the music</i>
<i>that captivated me once,</i>

323
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:52,083
<i>this air force life gave me a</i>
<i>lot of joy and responsibilities.</i>

324
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,291
<i>But Gopikrishnan seemed</i>
<i>like a changed man.</i>

325
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:10,208
<i>Was it drudgery or senior</i>
<i>officers' conduct towards him?</i>

326
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:13,208
<i>Something seemed to bother him.</i>

327
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:16,625
GK?

328
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:18,208
-What happened?
-Peter George.

329
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:20,416
These people will make me work to death.

330
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:21,916
It will be alright.

331
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,166
Why didn't you attend Sharada's call?

332
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:27,250
I'll call back.

333
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,458
Please take off that bedsheet.

334
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,583
Please fold it as well.

335
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:40,791
For the next fusion party.

336
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
-Nonsense!
-Won't you come with me?

337
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,791
Of course. Do you want to do it now?

338
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:49,416
No.

339
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,791
I'm going home tomorrow.

340
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:56,041
I got sick leave for a month.

341
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:59,458
-Shall we do it when I'm back?
-Certainly.

342
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:02,291
But make sure you come back!

343
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:04,500
I'll come back.

344
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:08,791
Sure.

345
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:10,708
Sorry.

346
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,333
<i>That day, when he said goodbye</i>

347
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:17,500
<i>I thought it was a farewell</i>
<i>before another vacation.</i>

348
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:19,083
<i>But it wasn't.</i>

349
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,291
<i>It was his final goodbye…</i>

350
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:24,250
<i>from the air force and my life.</i>

351
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:27,333
-<i>I realized it later.</i>
-Thank you.

352
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:29,166
-You played well.
-Thank you.

353
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:32,625
-Hi, Peter.
-Hi.

354
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,666
-Good game.
-Thank you.

355
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,875
-It's been a while, right?
-Yeah, it's been some time.

356
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,875
The Bonus Act revision is on.
I was busy with that.

357
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,041
Okay.

358
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,416
Hey, I'm really sorry.

359
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,625
I heard about it when
the dispatch arrived today.

360
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:49,541
-What happened?
-It's about your friend Gopikrishnan.

361
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:50,833
What about him?

362
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,125
The police inquiry
report came this morning.

363
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,291
Don't you know about it?

364
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:56,208
Tell me what the matter is.

365
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,291
He committed suicide.

366
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:01,916
-Who?
-Gopikrishnan.

367
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,583
-Are you sure?
-Yes!

368
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:11,750
I was there when the report
was handed over to Mr. Sathya.

369
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,541
-It was very unfortunate.
-Oh, God!

370
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:18,958
The circular might be issued
to all departments tomorrow.

371
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,833
<i>When the circular is issued,</i>

372
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,458
<i>the entire department</i>
<i>and unit will know about it.</i>

373
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:33,416
<i>But there is someone</i>
<i>who ought to hear it first.</i>

374
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:34,583
<i>Sharada.</i>

375
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,000
<i>It wasn't easy for me to</i>
<i>inform her of that death.</i>

376
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,541
What brings you here?

377
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,708
We received a message in the office.

378
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:54,333
The report says it was a suicide.

379
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:58,208
But GK?

380
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:00,708
Why would GK do such a thing?

381
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,916
What could be the reason?

382
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:06,125
Do you know why?

383
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:35,833
HIM AND HER

384
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,583
What did the telegram say?

385
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,250
It just said, "Come home."

386
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,208
Could this be about your marriage?

387
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:54,750
That's a good guess.

388
00:31:56,791 --> 00:32:00,416
You'll have to find a new teacher
if I stop working after my wedding

389
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,583
to learn Hindi and Marathi. Okay?

390
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:04,583
Why should I learn Hindi
and Gujarati if I have to go to Persia?

391
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:07,958
-I'd rather learn Arabic.
-So, that's your plan!

392
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,416
-I'm putting your tea on my tab.
-Attagirl!

393
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:16,125
You bought me tea as your wedding treat.

394
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:17,250
Shall we go?

395
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,458
You can go ahead.
I need to make a local call.

396
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:26,083
-Gopikrishnan, there's a call for you.
-Okay.

397
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:28,500
-Peter, I'll be right back. Salim.
-Okay.

398
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:29,916
Come on.

399
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:32,083
Hello.

400
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:33,791
Is this young lord?

401
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:37,916
Well, I'm all grown-up now.

402
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,083
And speaking about the label…

403
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,791
I gave it up long ago.

404
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:43,708
Is this someone from Cheriyanaad?

405
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,250
It's me, Sharada.

406
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,791
Remember?

407
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:48,916
I'm in Bombay studying nursing.

408
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:50,291
Ms. Malini is funding my studies.

409
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:54,541
She wants you to come home
if you're free this Sunday.

410
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:55,958
I'll think about it.

411
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,250
You can hang up.

412
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,375
Shall I give you the address?

413
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,791
I don't need the address.

414
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:02,416
Don't worry about it.

415
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:06,250
People from the air force
can come flying anywhere.

416
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,458
Have your first peg when
the mustard seeds pop.

417
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:17,958
-Awesome!
-So, shall we start?

418
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:20,166
-Water?
-No, I don't need water.

419
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:21,125
You don't?

420
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,000
Give it to me.

421
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:25,708
Hey.

422
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:28,375
Add a little water, young man.

423
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,833
Don't have it neat!

424
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:31,625
Do you see that grey hair on you?

425
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,458
I want to keep mine as it is.

426
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,708
-That's why it's better to have neat.
-That's how I started as well.

427
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,583
Go and get the clothes from upstairs.

428
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:41,166
-Okay.
-Hide the glass.

429
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:44,083
-Isn't it ready yet?
-Give me ten minutes.

430
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:46,125
Don't try to hide. I know what it is.

431
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:48,833
You have lived only
one-third of your life.

432
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:49,750
Really?

433
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:51,625
Oh, you meant him.

434
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:54,208
-Aunt, where's Sharada?
-She went upstairs to get the clothes.

435
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,083
-Don't leave me alone.
-I'll be back soon.

436
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:04,125
-Do you want to cut your life short?
-Just one more.

437
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,208
Do whatever you like!

438
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:21,000
Why did you come up?
Do they need me downstairs?

439
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Yes, someone needs you.

440
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:30,875
But…

441
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,250
it's not them.

442
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:35,916
Somebody else needs you now.

443
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,541
Beautiful eyes make a girl…

444
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,833
look even more beautiful.

445
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
You are a beautiful girl.

446
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,250
Come closer.

447
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:56,416
A man doesn't look good…

448
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:58,083
when he forces himself on woman…

449
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:01,375
but only when he is guarding her dignity.

450
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:05,791
Do you still want to do this, young lord?

451
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:45,750
Is this a confession…
or admission of guilt?

452
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,208
-What if it's neither?
-Then?

453
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,291
Can you marry me?

454
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,541
Are you still hungover?

455
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,916
I don't drink cheap arrack.

456
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:03,958
Defence personnel have a liquor quota.

457
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:06,083
And it has a certain standard.

458
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,500
I saw your standards yesterday.

459
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,541
I asked only because I truly like you.

460
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,250
Don't think it will be strange just
because you were our servant's daughter.

461
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:20,291
I'm a man…

462
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:23,541
and you are a beautiful girl.

463
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:25,708
That's all.

464
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:40,458
I'll be with you until my death.

465
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:43,708
A troublemaker like you
could end up in jail.

466
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:48,125
There are chances of you going to jail…

467
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:50,791
but I won't.

468
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,333
I promise you. Alright?

469
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:55,791
Don't pay. I've an account here.

470
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,250
If your answer is a "yes…"

471
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,791
then I'll pay from now on.

472
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,708
Sir, here's the money for two cups of tea.

473
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:13,500
<i>This moment of mine</i>

474
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:16,208
<i>Has blossomed again</i>

475
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:21,208
<i>Let's wander in this beautiful night</i>

476
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:23,666
<i>There won't be anyone over there</i>

477
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:26,125
<i>May it be a beautiful time</i>

478
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:28,875
<i>Let me mesmerize you</i>

479
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,250
<i>And you can mesmerize me</i>

480
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,875
<i>In this beautiful night…</i>

481
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:39,041
<i>Oh, beauty that wanders</i>

482
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,041
<i>Let's embrace</i>

483
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:46,333
<i>We are meant for each other</i>

484
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:52,083
<i>Come to me, my love</i>
<i>Let's be happy</i>

485
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:57,500
Are you alone?

486
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,083
Yes. What happened, Aunt?

487
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,541
Don't try to act too smart.

488
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:06,000
Where is Gopikrishnan
who dropped you off here?

489
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:10,291
I took pity on a servant's girl.

490
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:12,375
That's why I brought you here with me.

491
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:16,208
But don't take it as an
opportunity to flirt with our boy.

492
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,208
What's the matter, Aunt?

493
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,291
I heard you shouting.

494
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:24,583
Gopikrishnan, don't try to fool me.

495
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:27,875
I don't care what you think
but she can't stay here anymore.

496
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:30,125
So, we are sending her back home.

497
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:31,958
Her staying here is a
problem for you, right?

498
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:34,958
What do you mean, Gopi?
We don't get it.

499
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,208
If I don't keep my promise to her…

500
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:44,791
people will blame it on your upbringing.

501
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:49,333
Pack your bags.

502
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:53,541
Do you want me to book
the trunk call to our town?

503
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:56,125
Or will you do it yourself?

504
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,250
Go and pack your things.

505
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:26,500
<i>If the heart is the ocean</i>
<i>Then the heartbeats are its waves</i>

506
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:30,916
<i>You are my life</i>

507
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,666
<i>Without you I'm incomplete</i>

508
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:41,041
<i>This birth is nothing without you</i>

509
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,666
<i>Don't be shy</i>

510
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,833
<i>Touch me right away</i>

511
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,583
<i>I have trust on you</i>

512
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:52,125
<i>Your wish is mine</i>

513
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:56,791
<i>You are my breath</i>
<i>You are my heartbeat</i>

514
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:02,041
<i>You are my life</i>

515
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,958
<i>This moment of life</i>

516
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:16,416
<i>Has blossomed again</i>

517
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,458
<i>Let's wander in this beautiful night</i>

518
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:24,166
<i>Let's wander in this night</i>

519
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:29,125
<i>Oh beauty that wanders</i>

520
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:34,208
<i>Let's embrace</i>

521
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:36,583
<i>We are meant for each other</i>

522
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:42,000
<i>Come to me, my love</i>
<i>Let's be happy</i>

523
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:09,833
What will you have, sir?

524
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,666
-What do I order?
-Just order something.

525
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,083
-Get us two cups of tea.
-Okay.

526
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:43,833
Shall I go?

527
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:56,000
<i>Just when my dreams</i>
<i>were about to take wings</i>

528
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:58,875
<i>the sun in my life was set forever.</i>

529
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,041
Where do I go now?

530
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:03,166
I don't know.

531
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,208
I'LL BE AT THE SUBWAY

532
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:06,375
Why?

533
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,500
You can ask me anything except for that.

534
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,416
Sharada!

535
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Listen to me!

536
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:27,583
That's all I want to know.

537
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:30,833
Why?

538
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,625
It's a secret.

539
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:34,958
A secret that's not
meant for Bombay city.

540
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,291
I'll tell you everything…

541
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,916
but not here. Somewhere far away.

542
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,916
I'll tell you in Persia.

543
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,500
Show me your palm.

544
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,708
I won't charge a lot of money.

545
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:52,083
-I don't like to get my palm read.
-Okay.

546
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,125
You can hide the lines on your palm.

547
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,625
But your destiny…

548
00:45:57,583 --> 00:45:59,791
You can't hide it even if you wanted to.

549
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:14,958
What's your name?

550
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:18,250
Kurup.

551
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:19,625
Sudhakara Kurup.

552
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,791
Sharada, sorry.

553
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:46,875
I got a bit late.

554
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:21,583
-Hey, come on. Catch me.
-Stop.

555
00:47:24,416 --> 00:47:26,416
Thank you. Hey, greet them.

556
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:27,833
How are you?

557
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Boss!

558
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:31,750
Assalamu alaikum, sir.

559
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:33,541
Come, please.

560
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,291
What's wrong with you?

561
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:51,083
I've been noticing it for a while.

562
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:53,708
What is it?

563
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:02,083
What happened?

564
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:06,166
Nothing.

565
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:08,458
We are going back to India.

566
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,416
That's all.

567
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,208
What do you mean?

568
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,666
What will we do there?

569
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:18,291
Our house is still under construction.

570
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:20,500
We have to raise two children.

571
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,291
Expenses will only go up.

572
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:24,625
What do you plan to do for money?

573
00:48:28,416 --> 00:48:31,583
I haven't done anything that
has put our family in distress.

574
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:32,666
I won't do that in the future either.

575
00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:36,750
So, I'll take the decisions here.

576
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:47,875
WHEN THE VILLAINS COME TOGETHER

577
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:10,416
-Can I woo her?
-Don't waste your time.

578
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:21,208
-She looks pretty, right?
-That will be an understatement.

579
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:24,708
Then, tell me.

580
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:27,000
Where do you think she is from?

581
00:49:27,291 --> 00:49:30,291
Her nose looks like…

582
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:33,708
I think she is from Punjab.

583
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:37,208
Or maybe she is from Gujarat.

584
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,541
You have to decide on one.

585
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,708
Yes, got it.

586
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:44,791
-She is from Bihar.
-How can you be so sure?

587
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:47,166
-Just look at how she walks.
-Really?

588
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:49,958
What are you doing?

589
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:51,958
You can ask her whatever you wanted to.

590
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:54,125
-What are you guys discussing?
-Leave me!

591
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:56,250
Please help me!
Let go of me.

592
00:49:56,541 --> 00:49:58,250
-Here you go!
-You!

593
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,083
I will… I will not spare you.

594
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:07,375
Brother?

595
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:08,708
-Help!
-Bhaskar.

596
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:10,958
-Let her go.
-Let's decide on something.

597
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:14,500
Either I will spend
my time with this girl…

598
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:16,625
-or someone will die.
-Hey!

599
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:18,416
What are you doing?

600
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,833
Let her go!

601
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,041
-Bro!
-Hey! Keep quiet!

602
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,458
I'm Roni.

603
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:55,208
I am Minister Rajesh Pancholi's
brother-in-law.

604
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:56,500
I want to use the phone.

605
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,333
Step aside.

606
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,541
-Roni.
-Bro!

607
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:11,125
-How did you get him out?
-I called my brother-in-law for it.

608
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:13,333
Bro!

609
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:18,916
Why did you hire a taxi?

610
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:19,958
Where's our car?

611
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:22,500
You're right.
It does look like a taxi.

612
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:24,375
Why did you hire a taxi, bro?

613
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:27,458
Let's get going now.
I'll tell you in detail when we are home.

614
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:30,500
-No, tell me now.
-No.

615
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:33,083
Why will you not tell now?

616
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:35,458
We're not leaving until you tell me.

617
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:38,666
Come on, say it.
Only then we'll get the signal.

618
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:41,500
I mean, to leave.

619
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:45,083
Bro.

620
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:47,875
-Where are the bottles?
-There is one in each suitcase.

621
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:51,000
Really?
Say it quickly. You come with me.

622
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:55,125
We had to pledge the car
because of an emergency.

623
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:57,250
I can return it in a week.

624
00:51:58,791 --> 00:51:59,916
-Roni.
-Yeah.

625
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,875
Listen carefully.

626
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:03,333
Until I get my car back

627
00:52:03,583 --> 00:52:05,458
you won't come with me.

628
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:08,166
You may leave.

629
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,041
I'll take care of it.

630
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:23,208
I want this car.

631
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:25,875
Single price.

632
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:27,208
Ready cash.

633
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:28,875
Do you agree for it?

634
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:31,875
-What?
-What is this?

635
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:34,666
Give it to me.

636
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,375
Scotch Whiskey.

637
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:40,458
Go and call him.

638
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:42,291
He will send a state car to get you home.

639
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:48,250
-Bro!
-Yeah.

640
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:50,500
Bring the luggage over there.

641
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:55,166
<i>Here's a beautiful journey</i>
<i>With a beautiful weather</i>

642
00:52:55,291 --> 00:53:00,333
<i>I hope I don't get lost</i>

643
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:05,000
<i>Here's a beautiful journey</i>
<i>With a beautiful weather</i>

644
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:09,333
<i>I hope the dawn doesn't come soon</i>

645
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,791
What's happening?

646
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:14,208
The movie <i>Kati Patang</i>

647
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:17,000
-used to be a stage play.
-Okay.

648
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,375
Don't you watch plays anymore?

649
00:53:20,958 --> 00:53:23,125
I said, don't you watch plays anymore?

650
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:25,375
I don't have the time, bro.

651
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:27,875
That's true! How can he make time?

652
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,708
He is always in the arrack shop.

653
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,291
That's true!

654
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:34,166
Brother…

655
00:53:34,416 --> 00:53:36,333
why don't you take him
to Persia once again?

656
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:38,333
At least he can make
some money over there.

657
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:43,000
I haven't recovered
from my first visit yet.

658
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:44,458
Neither have I.

659
00:53:56,291 --> 00:53:57,500
Hear me out, Pankaj.

660
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:00,375
You don't have to go to
Persia to make money.

661
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:01,875
Then?

662
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:08,625
You can make money from here as well.

663
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,125
It's easy for you, brother.

664
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,083
But it's damn difficult
for people like us.

665
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:17,208
You can do it as well.

666
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:19,375
But you need to stick with sir.

667
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:21,125
Suppose you had a lot of money.

668
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:22,500
What will you do with it?

669
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:25,916
But now that you have asked…

670
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:29,625
I feel greedy.

671
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,875
An old secondhand Ambassador car.

672
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:35,750
I can drive it around and make a living.

673
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:39,208
-Pankaj.
-Yeah?

674
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:40,166
Don't settle for one.

675
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,875
You can buy ten new Ambassador cars.

676
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:44,666
I'll give you the money.

677
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:45,916
What do you think?

678
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:02,375
How is my mansion, Shyamu?

679
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:06,958
It looks like our sheikh's palace, sir.

680
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:09,291
Don't you want a house like this?

681
00:55:10,166 --> 00:55:11,041
Yes, I do.

682
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:14,166
-But not such a big house.
-What's the deal, bro?

683
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,291
Relax.

684
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:19,000
We are about to do some mischief.

685
00:55:19,708 --> 00:55:21,291
So it's good to begin
with a glass of drink.

686
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:24,000
Drink? Why not?

687
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:45,791
Bhaskar.

688
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:49,416
I have a life insurance policy in Persia.

689
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:53,166
-Why don't we claim it?
-We can.

690
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:56,583
Is it worth thousands?

691
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:01,041
It will be about eight lakh rupees.

692
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:03,041
Eight lakh rupees?

693
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,875
Why didn't you bring it with you?

694
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:08,166
That's okay.

695
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:12,208
Tell Sharada to
bring it tomorrow itself.

696
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:15,666
What the hell are you saying?

697
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:18,500
It can be claimed only after my death.

698
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,750
Brother, what's the plan?

699
00:56:24,208 --> 00:56:25,250
I'll tell you.

700
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:31,291
-Bhaskar.
-Yes?

701
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:32,916
Who am I?

702
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:36,708
-Don't you know who you are?
-I didn't mean that!

703
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:38,666
What's my name?

704
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:40,458
Gopikrishnan.

705
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,083
What?

706
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,416
Gopikrishnan?

707
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:46,583
Shyamu, tell me.
What's my name?

708
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:49,208
Kurup… Sudhakara Kurup.

709
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:52,416
So if Gopikrishnan could
become Sudhakara Kurup…

710
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:54,750
then in a matter of no time…

711
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:57,458
Sudhakar can
be reborn as somebody else.

712
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,041
Am I right, Bhaskar?

713
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,875
Good idea!

714
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:04,916
It's very interesting.

715
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:07,375
But how can that happen?

716
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:11,541
It won't happen on its own.

717
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:13,041
It has to be done by us.

718
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,791
But if it goes as per our plan…

719
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,875
we can share
the eight lakh rupees among us.

720
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:19,750
Eight lakh rupees?

721
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:23,708
I'm ready to do anything
for eight lakh rupees.

722
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:26,125
You can't have
eight lakh rupees to yourself.

723
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:27,416
It's for all of us.

724
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,625
-At least I'll get a part of it.
-Now listen.

725
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:31,708
I want a body double.

726
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:34,000
A corpse of the same height and build.

727
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:38,291
We will get a body double.

728
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,166
We have to go to Kottayam.

729
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:47,625
Then we have to go to the medical college.

730
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:50,916
Pick up the thing.

731
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:52,833
-And come back here.
-What thing?

732
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:54,666
-Corpse.
-Corpse?

733
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:57,916
-Madhu.
-Who is Madhu?

734
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:00,500
Just explain it, Bhaskar.

735
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:02,333
We can do it with Madhu's help.

736
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,125
But it's going to cost you some money.

737
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:10,000
Go for it.

738
00:58:10,666 --> 00:58:12,958
Don't worry about the expenses.
I'll take care of it.

739
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:25,916
People will say I'm showing off
because I'm a Gulf expat.

740
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,083
They won't say that.

741
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:29,791
Then they should say that.

742
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:40,791
Here.

743
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:46,583
Keep this inside, Mom.

744
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:48,458
-Note down the date.
-Okay.

745
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:55,458
We just got back from Kottayam.

746
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:58,083
Madhu said there was a corpse
in the medical college there.

747
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:02,416
Tell me what happened.

748
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:04,875
We reached late because of this fellow.

749
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,458
There's nothing left to say.

750
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:09,291
By the time we got there
they had already burnt the corpse.

751
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:15,375
But now I have a different plan in mind.

752
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:19,208
-We will--
-I'm not interested in your story.

753
00:59:19,291 --> 00:59:22,833
Neither am I obliged to
split the money with you.

754
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:25,333
So if you can't do it, then get lost!

755
00:59:56,666 --> 00:59:58,458
Stop playing around and
give those things to me.

756
00:59:58,541 --> 00:59:59,708
Quiet!

757
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:01,208
It must be here.

758
01:00:05,958 --> 01:00:07,791
Oh, no! Bhaskar, careful!

759
01:00:08,458 --> 01:00:09,500
We are finished.

760
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,708
What have I done?

761
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:20,625
It's rotten.

762
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:35,916
-Bhaskar.
-Yes.

763
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,166
Shouldn't we cover the grave?

764
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:40,833
Go and cover it.
And have tea before you return.

765
01:00:58,416 --> 01:01:00,000
-Bhaskar.
-Yes?

766
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:02,125
It's a woman.

767
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:12,875
Pankaj.

768
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:14,791
Stop the car.

769
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,291
I think a body has washed up.

770
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:24,916
-Let's check.
-Come along with me.

771
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,500
-Come on.
-Let's go.

772
01:01:27,916 --> 01:01:30,791
-Slow down. You're getting old!
-Nonsense!

773
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:35,833
Pankaj, how can we
move the corpse from here?

774
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,458
-Excuse me, brother.
-Move.

775
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,375
When did it wash up?

776
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:54,666
Just now.

777
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,541
I was tempted by the
offer of eight lakh rupees.

778
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:08,458
But now I feel stuck
between the devil and the sea.

779
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:12,166
Do you think it's possible, Bhaskar?

780
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:13,958
Yes, it's possible.

781
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:15,666
It has happened before.

782
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:17,041
So let's not talk about that.

783
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,791
All of us have equal stakes in the money.

784
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:21,708
You can decide if you want it or not.

785
01:02:22,416 --> 01:02:24,125
Kurup will go ahead with the plan.

786
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:27,625
I'll be right back.

787
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:37,333
-Sir, shall I take it?
-Wait a minute.

788
01:02:42,791 --> 01:02:43,625
Here you go.

789
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:50,666
Would you like to have anything else, sir?

790
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:51,750
-No.
-Okay, sir.

791
01:03:18,416 --> 01:03:20,666
I need to go home early.

792
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:51,041
Come on!

793
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:53,291
Hey, Kanhaiya!

794
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,541
I am here!

795
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,250
Hey!

796
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:05,333
-Do you have a matchbox?
-Yes.

797
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:08,958
Here it is, sir.

798
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:16,333
-Do you smoke?
-Yes, occasionally.

799
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:23,625
-Just cigarettes, right?
-Not that much.

800
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Here.

801
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:29,250
I had a cigarette in my pocket.

802
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:31,791
-Here you go.
-No thanks, sir.

803
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:33,791
Hey, it's from Persia.

804
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,208
-Do you drink?
-Yes, at times.

805
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:42,541
Come on then, join me.

806
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:44,625
No, sir. I'm on duty right now.

807
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:45,916
What do you mean?

808
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:47,833
See! That's our car.

809
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,541
-We'll go, have a drink
-Sir.

810
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:52,041
-and come back. Done!
-Sir, I can't drink on duty.

811
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:54,625
-I swear nobody will come to know.
-No, thank you, sir.

812
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:57,583
-Come on, man!
-No, sir.

813
01:04:57,666 --> 01:05:00,041
Have a few drinks with me.
It will lighten up your mood.

814
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:01,750
No, sir. It's okay.

815
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:07,208
-Sir, leave me alone. Sir, I'm working.
-Let's have a drink.

816
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:10,916
-You can go after having a drink.
-Brother, take your hands off me.

817
01:05:11,916 --> 01:05:15,041
-Why can't you drink with me?
-Hey, take your hands off me.

818
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:16,958
I said let me go.

819
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:20,083
-Just have a drink with me!
-Take your hands off me!

820
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:23,500
You idiot! How could you do this to me!

821
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:25,833
-Let him go!
-You…

822
01:05:26,916 --> 01:05:29,750
I will not spare you.
I will force you to have it.

823
01:05:29,833 --> 01:05:31,875
-How could you not listen to me?
-Sorry.

824
01:05:34,416 --> 01:05:35,333
You idiot!

825
01:05:35,958 --> 01:05:39,375
Shut up or I'll pay back for all
that you have done since Persia.

826
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,583
Got it?

827
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:47,333
Will it hurt if you get a fresh corpse?

828
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:50,958
Help him get better and drop him home!

829
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,583
I'll be at Kumar's bar.

830
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:56,625
-Bro!
-Get lost!

831
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,625
Hey.

832
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:16,708
-What?
-What is eight divided by four?

833
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:19,125
That will be two.

834
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:20,916
Why?

835
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:25,750
So, what is eight divided by three?

836
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:31,250
Three?

837
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:49,166
Bhaskar, watch out!

838
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:55,041
-Pankaj.
-Yeah.

839
01:06:59,666 --> 01:07:03,750
When we have someone with us
who is as tall and big as Kurup…

840
01:07:04,791 --> 01:07:06,875
why should we hunt for another corpse?

841
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:44,208
You got scared?

842
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,416
Just think about it.

843
01:07:51,583 --> 01:07:53,041
Eight lakh!

844
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:57,333
We three will get it.

845
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:04,541
Two-and-a-half lakh goes for one!

846
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,750
Two-and-a-half lakh goes for twice!

847
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:13,708
And the final call for
two-and-a-half lakh!

848
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:21,458
I'll take the balance 50,000 rupees

849
01:08:22,208 --> 01:08:24,833
as a prize for my wicked mind.

850
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:43,916
IN PURSUIT OF HIM

851
01:09:24,041 --> 01:09:25,041
Sir.

852
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:28,333
Sir, careful.

853
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:31,666
Step back.

854
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:45,416
-Johnny?
-Sir.

855
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:48,250
Collect the soil from here
and also the matchbox.

856
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:50,375
Sir.

857
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,250
It's difficult, sir.

858
01:10:18,416 --> 01:10:20,666
The face is fully charred
but we know that it's a man.

859
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:24,208
So, are you doing a postmortem
on the spot?

860
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:26,250
Yes.

861
01:10:30,416 --> 01:10:31,583
-Johnny?
-Sir.

862
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:34,500
Any other information? Evidence?

863
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:38,083
The car belongs to Sudhakar Kurup.

864
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:39,791
He came home three weeks ago.

865
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:41,541
Two of our men have gone to his place.

866
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:42,750
-In civil dress?
-Yes, sir.

867
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:46,333
-Check the area once again.
-Sure, sir.

868
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:58,500
He is going to be taken to the court.
Sir is here.

869
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:03,708
-Sir.
-Sir.

870
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:06,291
-What's happening here?
-Kurup used to stay here.

871
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:08,000
This is his relative's house, sir.

872
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:12,083
Sir, they seem convinced
that Kurup is dead.

873
01:11:12,208 --> 01:11:16,166
But… when I passed by their
kitchen I could smell chicken curry.

874
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:20,208
Chicken curry!

875
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:24,333
Oh, no!

876
01:11:24,416 --> 01:11:25,791
Why did you throw it?

877
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,708
Was the chicken curry too salty?

878
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:29,583
It is…

879
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:31,583
Sir, it had gone bad.

880
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:40,041
-Are you going to a wedding?
-No, sir.

881
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:43,250
I always dress up like this.

882
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:47,583
You go inside. The baby is crying.

883
01:11:50,166 --> 01:11:51,250
He is with dad.

884
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:56,791
Is the man who died in
the fields, your relative?

885
01:11:56,958 --> 01:11:57,875
Yes, sir.

886
01:11:59,458 --> 01:12:00,291
Come here.

887
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,541
How did you find it out?

888
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:06,583
-It's Kurup's car, right?
-Yeah.

889
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:09,583
Kurup doesn't trust
anyone else with his car.

890
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:11,166
Oh, is that so?

891
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:13,791
If you think it's Sudhakara Kurup,

892
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,875
then, why didn't you come there?

893
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:18,000
-Is there any issue between both of you?
-Not at all.

894
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:20,000
Kurup is like a younger brother to me.

895
01:12:20,666 --> 01:12:23,500
I can't bear to see him like that, sir.

896
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:25,583
So, what next?

897
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:28,708
We have to make
arrangements for the funeral.

898
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:30,541
Everyone has to be informed.

899
01:12:31,791 --> 01:12:32,958
What about his relatives?

900
01:12:33,625 --> 01:12:35,083
His father died a long time ago.

901
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:38,083
His mother is at a hospital in Pandalam.

902
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
His wife, Sharada, is in Persia.

903
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,625
She hasn't been informed yet.

904
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,833
Is that a washroom?

905
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:54,416
Yes, it's a washroom.
We don't use it anymore.

906
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:03,166
Nobody comes here anymore, sir.

907
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:13,750
What is it, sir?

908
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:26,250
Didn't I tell you that we
don't use it anymore?

909
01:13:26,916 --> 01:13:27,916
Step aside.

910
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,666
Don't you go to a barbershop, Bhaskar?

911
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:14,875
Or do you like to set your hair on fire?

912
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
To heck with you!

913
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:19,583
It's right here.

914
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:25,000
Fold your sleeves.

915
01:14:25,625 --> 01:14:27,416
No, sir.
It looks better this way.

916
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:32,416
There's a lot of powder on your face.
So you can't look any better.

917
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:35,083
Fold it.

918
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:36,666
Come on!

919
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:41,708
Fold it up.

920
01:14:42,666 --> 01:14:43,500
Come on, do it.

921
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:46,125
Fold it up.

922
01:15:00,916 --> 01:15:01,916
What happened?

923
01:15:02,791 --> 01:15:04,625
It happened while I was warming
myself up by the fire this morning.

924
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:11,083
This happened at the
same time as well, right?

925
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:14,083
-Johnny?
-Sir.

926
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:17,000
Something was burnt in here.
Find out what it is.

927
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:21,250
Send the burnt hair and
matchsticks to the forensic lab.

928
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:22,333
Yes, sir.

929
01:15:22,708 --> 01:15:23,708
And this fellow…

930
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:25,791
Let's take him with us.

931
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:30,583
Come on, Bhaskar.

932
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:41,375
Give me something to eat, sir.

933
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:43,125
I have been here for a while now.

934
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,333
-Johnny?
-Sir?

935
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:47,916
Bhaskar loves chicken, right?

936
01:15:48,916 --> 01:15:51,166
-Buy a chicken biryani for him.
-Okay, sir.

937
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:53,458
Go.

938
01:16:13,875 --> 01:16:15,125
Sir, pass the water.

939
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:17,833
Water!

940
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:20,500
-Johnny?
-Sir?

941
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:24,500
Don't give him water for two days.

942
01:16:24,625 --> 01:16:25,625
Okay, sir.

943
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:30,875
But…

944
01:16:31,958 --> 01:16:32,958
Sir.

945
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:41,583
Go ahead.

946
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,583
Sudhakara Kurup was murdered.

947
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:53,750
I killed him.

948
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:01,625
Kurup took me to Persia a few years ago.

949
01:17:02,541 --> 01:17:03,791
It was of no use.

950
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:08,500
I ran several errands
for him for two years.

951
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:12,041
Then he sent me back
without paying a penny.

952
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,833
We have been at odds ever since.

953
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:22,250
Whenever I asked for my money…

954
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:24,250
he would give excuses.

955
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:26,958
Then he would buy me a
drink and send me home.

956
01:17:30,041 --> 01:17:32,416
I had been waiting for my chance.

957
01:17:33,916 --> 01:17:36,166
So, when I got hold of him…

958
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:39,833
Sir, I was drunk at that time.

959
01:17:41,916 --> 01:17:45,250
Give me some water.

960
01:18:15,541 --> 01:18:17,083
I didn't mean to kill him.

961
01:18:19,541 --> 01:18:22,000
But I don't regret it either.

962
01:18:30,791 --> 01:18:33,416
DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE
CHENGANNUR

963
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:43,500
Sir, here is the detailed
report on Sudhakara Kurup.

964
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:45,583
-Johnny?
-Sir.

965
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:46,958
What do you think?

966
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:50,166
Did Bhaskar kill Sudhakara Kurup?

967
01:18:51,208 --> 01:18:53,875
Sir, Bhaskar is a compulsive liar.

968
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:57,541
Did he have a strong motive for murder?

969
01:18:57,958 --> 01:18:58,958
I don't know, sir.

970
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:02,708
But why should he take
the blame for murder, sir?

971
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:08,708
This is my hunch.

972
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,791
There's something fishy about this case.

973
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:14,458
-You do one thing.
-Sir.

974
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:17,000
Check the latest missing cases.

975
01:19:17,083 --> 01:19:18,500
-Okay, sir.
-Let's see.

976
01:19:28,666 --> 01:19:30,625
-What's his name?
-Sir, his name is Charlie.

977
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:31,666
He is a representative.

978
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:33,791
He has been missing for three days.

979
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,875
-So, has it been three days?
-Yes, sir.

980
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:43,875
-Any news about him?
-We are investigating.

981
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:49,083
He told us that he would
return the same night.

982
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:52,750
He wanted to take her to
the Church feast.

983
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:53,875
This is his wife.

984
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:57,958
We went to the police when
he didn't return for two days.

985
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:01,291
Can Charlie drive?

986
01:20:01,916 --> 01:20:03,500
No, sir. Why?

987
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:05,541
It's nothing.

988
01:20:05,625 --> 01:20:07,250
There was an incident in Cheriyanaad.

989
01:20:07,625 --> 01:20:08,708
A car accident.

990
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:10,708
We recovered a body from the car.

991
01:20:11,416 --> 01:20:12,666
The man hasn't been identified yet.

992
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:16,375
We came to check if the two
cases are somehow related.

993
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,375
-Johnny?
-Sir.

994
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,166
This is his photo.

995
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:29,625
This isn't him, sir.

996
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:34,666
I can understand what you are feeling.

997
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:38,541
This is just a part of our investigation.

998
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,875
We found this on that body.

999
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:46,458
Does it belong to Charlie?

1000
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:53,750
I don't know, sir.

1001
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,458
Nancy. My child!

1002
01:21:11,291 --> 01:21:13,958
-May I?
-Sir, it's not possible. He can't drive.

1003
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:16,583
I think she is confused.
It can't be Charlie.

1004
01:21:23,916 --> 01:21:25,541
I apologize for bothering you.

1005
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:28,541
In some cases people are misidentified.

1006
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:30,166
That's why I wanted to check.

1007
01:21:32,125 --> 01:21:34,125
Does this belong to Charlie?

1008
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
This belongs to my husband, sir.

1009
01:21:50,333 --> 01:21:51,958
This belonged to my husband.

1010
01:21:57,625 --> 01:22:00,208
My child and I have
no one in this world, sir.

1011
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:08,041
My child has been orphaned.

1012
01:22:19,083 --> 01:22:20,291
Stop hitting me, sir.

1013
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:24,333
Please stop it.

1014
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:26,166
Sir, I'll tell you everything.

1015
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:28,708
That's enough.

1016
01:22:36,666 --> 01:22:39,375
I'll take the balance 50,000 rupees…

1017
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:41,958
as a prize for my wicked mind.

1018
01:22:52,416 --> 01:22:53,416
Bhaskar.

1019
01:22:55,208 --> 01:22:56,250
My boss…

1020
01:22:56,958 --> 01:22:58,000
How can we do that to him?

1021
01:23:02,666 --> 01:23:06,458
You are a very smart guy!

1022
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:09,041
You seem to be a good man.

1023
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:12,625
-Pankaj!
-Yeah.

1024
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:15,333
Open the boot of the car.

1025
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,208
Somebody needs a ride.

1026
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,208
Pull the car over there.

1027
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:35,166
-Are you headed for Alappuzha?
-Yeah.

1028
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:36,666
Can I get a ride?

1029
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:38,958
Three buses passed without stopping.

1030
01:23:49,208 --> 01:23:51,291
Shyamu, open the door for this fellow.

1031
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:54,375
-Come on.
-Goodbye, bro.

1032
01:23:54,541 --> 01:23:55,583
Okay.

1033
01:24:02,041 --> 01:24:03,708
Thank you, brother.

1034
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:28,875
Pankaj, is that you?

1035
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:32,375
Charlie?

1036
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:35,833
-What are you doing here?
-I'm back in town now.

1037
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:37,333
Nancy is pregnant.

1038
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:38,833
Oh.

1039
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,708
Today is our wedding anniversary.

1040
01:24:44,208 --> 01:24:46,541
I promised to take her to
the Church fest.

1041
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:48,416
That's why I started at night itself.

1042
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:49,916
Bhaskar?

1043
01:24:50,083 --> 01:24:51,791
I know this young man.

1044
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:54,375
That makes everything so easy.

1045
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:59,916
-You should have a drink with us.
-Oh, no, bro.

1046
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:02,166
I told you I have to take
my wife to the church.

1047
01:25:04,416 --> 01:25:05,458
Pankaj!

1048
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:07,583
Pankaj!

1049
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:16,458
Pankaj.

1050
01:25:17,125 --> 01:25:19,000
-Alappuzha is straight ahead, right?
-Yes.

1051
01:25:19,208 --> 01:25:23,250
We have to go to Pallana
to pick someone up.

1052
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:25,500
-Then we will go to Alappuzha.
-Alright.

1053
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:30,041
Whether it's a feast or a festival,

1054
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,958
this is a must to have a good time.

1055
01:25:35,541 --> 01:25:37,583
Take it easy.

1056
01:25:37,791 --> 01:25:40,416
-Have a drink.
-No, brother.

1057
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,958
-My wife is pregnant. It makes her sick.
-Hey.

1058
01:25:44,541 --> 01:25:46,791
It's the only joy in life.
Come on.

1059
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:48,333
No. Let it be.

1060
01:25:49,458 --> 01:25:50,333
Pankaj!

1061
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:52,666
Stop the car.

1062
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,583
I don't feel comfortable
sitting here anymore.

1063
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:14,541
No drinks on a feast day!
What kind of a man are you?

1064
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:16,416
-Have a drink. Come on!
-No!

1065
01:26:16,916 --> 01:26:18,291
Hey, have one.

1066
01:26:21,666 --> 01:26:22,625
Have it.

1067
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:26,541
It tastes foul.

1068
01:26:27,333 --> 01:26:28,791
Alcohols do taste foul.

1069
01:26:28,875 --> 01:26:29,750
Just drink it!

1070
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:31,500
No, brother.

1071
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:33,041
Come on, have it.

1072
01:26:34,083 --> 01:26:35,333
No. Let it be.

1073
01:26:36,041 --> 01:26:36,875
Have it!

1074
01:26:37,166 --> 01:26:38,125
Drink!

1075
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:39,833
Have it!

1076
01:26:41,083 --> 01:26:43,125
Hold him down!

1077
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:48,166
-How dare you turn down a drink?
-Bro.

1078
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:49,958
Pankaj!

1079
01:26:51,208 --> 01:26:52,625
How dare you spit in the car!

1080
01:26:54,166 --> 01:26:55,166
Hold him tight!

1081
01:26:57,916 --> 01:27:01,250
Have it.

1082
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:23,500
Move him here.

1083
01:27:35,791 --> 01:27:36,833
Stop right here.

1084
01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:51,458
KUTTANANDAN BAR

1085
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,500
I told you to take him home.

1086
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:05,125
We got what you asked for.

1087
01:28:18,333 --> 01:28:20,875
-Where did you find it?
-We just killed him.

1088
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,291
About an hour ago, right?

1089
01:28:35,041 --> 01:28:36,041
Get the car.

1090
01:28:39,208 --> 01:28:40,291
We can't go to my house.

1091
01:28:40,458 --> 01:28:41,458
Let's go to your place.

1092
01:28:43,208 --> 01:28:44,208
Hurry up!

1093
01:28:51,583 --> 01:28:54,083
Take it to the washroom at the back.
Shyamu, help them.

1094
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:27,458
Are you doing it in here?

1095
01:29:28,416 --> 01:29:29,458
We will burn the face now.

1096
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:32,083
The body can be burned somewhere else.

1097
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,458
That's okay.

1098
01:30:19,583 --> 01:30:20,916
Let me set you on fire.

1099
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:23,125
Come on, fire up!

1100
01:30:27,541 --> 01:30:29,541
Bhaskar!

1101
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:31,583
Careful.

1102
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:40,416
Bhaskar!

1103
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,208
Hurry up!

1104
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:17,125
So, you will do anything for money.

1105
01:31:17,375 --> 01:31:18,458
-Right?
-No, sir.

1106
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,375
We couldn't turn down the
offer of eight lakh rupees.

1107
01:31:21,791 --> 01:31:23,166
-Eight lakh?
-Yeah.

1108
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:26,333
Can we ever make so
much money in our lifetime?

1109
01:31:27,333 --> 01:31:28,250
It's true, sir.

1110
01:31:28,708 --> 01:31:32,541
He told me to dream of ten
Ambassador cars parked on my porch.

1111
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:33,916
That's how Kurup lured us.

1112
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:38,708
What was your share?

1113
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:40,583
Sir…

1114
01:31:42,958 --> 01:31:45,333
we were promised two lakh rupees each.

1115
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,291
Two lakh!

1116
01:31:50,166 --> 01:31:52,250
That means two lakh
rupees for Sudhakara Kurup.

1117
01:31:53,333 --> 01:31:57,083
Do you know how much Kurup
and his wife earn in Gulf?

1118
01:31:59,541 --> 01:32:01,166
80,000 rupees a month!

1119
01:32:02,291 --> 01:32:04,625
The same guy committed a murder…

1120
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:06,375
for two lakh rupees.

1121
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:07,916
Forget about that.

1122
01:32:08,541 --> 01:32:10,791
-Will he do it for eight lakh, Johnny?
-No, sir.

1123
01:32:15,416 --> 01:32:19,541
So, money was not the only
motive behind the murder.

1124
01:32:25,208 --> 01:32:27,041
When did you last see Kurup, Bhaskar?

1125
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:29,791
In the paddy field that night.

1126
01:32:31,791 --> 01:32:32,791
And you?

1127
01:32:33,333 --> 01:32:35,416
Ernakulam, sir.

1128
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:40,375
Then he asked me to
board a bus to Chavakkad.

1129
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,041
Who else was with you?

1130
01:32:42,833 --> 01:32:43,958
That day…

1131
01:32:44,291 --> 01:32:45,750
Kurup and…

1132
01:32:48,583 --> 01:32:49,583
Pankaj were there with me.

1133
01:32:55,583 --> 01:32:58,541
I know you are working hard.

1134
01:32:58,833 --> 01:33:01,333
But how can I convince our superiors?

1135
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:06,083
Now that we have issued a
lookout circular for Kurup across India,

1136
01:33:06,458 --> 01:33:08,458
they have warned of
cutting my salary to pay it off.

1137
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:10,500
In fact, I can put up with that.

1138
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:15,166
What really annoys me are the
reporters and their relentless questions.

1139
01:33:17,666 --> 01:33:19,375
So, what's the status
of the investigation?

1140
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:22,416
Can we nab Sudhakara Kurup
before the end of this century?

1141
01:33:31,083 --> 01:33:32,375
Sir, cigarette.

1142
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:36,375
I need a blade.

1143
01:33:36,541 --> 01:33:37,625
I'll get it for you, sir.

1144
01:33:47,708 --> 01:33:48,666
Can I ask you something?

1145
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:51,916
It's the same question.

1146
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:54,708
If you were in Kurup's place,
what will you do after the murder?

1147
01:33:55,333 --> 01:33:57,333
I'll leave the country
if I think I'll be caught.

1148
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,875
-But Kurup hasn't left the country yet.
-Yes.

1149
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:03,458
He can't travel using his passport.
Then, how can he flee the country?

1150
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:05,166
He can use a fake passport.

1151
01:34:05,416 --> 01:34:07,458
It's easy for him to get one.

1152
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:12,416
As per Bhaskar's statement,
Kurup revealed his plan

1153
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,625
to Ponnachan, Sabu and Bhaskar
on the same day he arrived.

1154
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,166
Which means the story
about Sudhakara Kurup's death

1155
01:34:18,375 --> 01:34:20,458
was conceived not
in Kerala but in Persia.

1156
01:34:21,916 --> 01:34:25,708
Kurup came home in a hurry without
bothering to make a fake passport.

1157
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:29,125
So, the story of his death was
created not only for the people here

1158
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,958
but also for his friends
outside the country.

1159
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:33,416
-What do you mean?
-Sir…

1160
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:37,041
somebody in Persia should
believe that Kurup is dead.

1161
01:34:37,291 --> 01:34:38,500
Or should feel compelled to believe in it.

1162
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:40,708
Sir.

1163
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:44,250
Sudhakara Kurup has
been seen in Alankrita Lodge.

1164
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,583
-Who gave the tip-off?
-Sir, one of the hotel staff called.

1165
01:34:49,375 --> 01:34:50,375
Das?

1166
01:34:50,875 --> 01:34:51,875
Sir?

1167
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:55,291
Deal with him before
he is taken to the court.

1168
01:35:01,333 --> 01:35:02,458
Sir, here is the blade.

1169
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:16,916
Kurup is in there, sir.

1170
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:18,708
-Room number 122.
-Okay.

1171
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:25,375
-Hey, break it down.
-Sir.

1172
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:28,333
Move.

1173
01:35:32,041 --> 01:35:33,541
Sir, he is not here.

1174
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:47,625
-Check downstairs. Quick!
-Yes, sir.

1175
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:50,333
He has left by the backyard.
Let's go and check there.

1176
01:36:00,416 --> 01:36:02,458
Sir, over there.

1177
01:36:06,416 --> 01:36:08,041
Perazhi Transport Service.

1178
01:36:08,375 --> 01:36:09,708
18th point.

1179
01:36:10,958 --> 01:36:11,791
Mannar.

1180
01:36:13,333 --> 01:36:14,333
Sir.

1181
01:36:15,875 --> 01:36:16,791
We couldn't find him, sir.

1182
01:36:17,833 --> 01:36:18,750
He got away.

1183
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:22,375
Kurup has an acquaintance in Mannar.

1184
01:36:22,458 --> 01:36:23,916
It could be a relative or a friend.

1185
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,041
-Find out who it is.
-Yes, sir.

1186
01:36:25,583 --> 01:36:27,583
-Make it quick! Right now.
-Okay, sir!

1187
01:36:33,541 --> 01:36:34,541
Tell me something.

1188
01:36:35,958 --> 01:36:39,333
Radhakrishnan brought
Sudhakara Kurup to your home.

1189
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:40,625
Where did he go from here?

1190
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:44,833
I don't like to repeat myself.

1191
01:36:46,125 --> 01:36:47,708
Maybe it's because of my age.

1192
01:36:48,208 --> 01:36:49,375
Anyway, I don't like it at all.

1193
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:51,708
But I'll still tell you…

1194
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:53,583
for the last time.

1195
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:56,958
I don't know.

1196
01:36:58,708 --> 01:37:00,708
So, won't you speak the truth?

1197
01:37:01,208 --> 01:37:02,125
Smart fellow!

1198
01:37:03,375 --> 01:37:04,625
You figured it out yourself.

1199
01:37:06,958 --> 01:37:08,791
Gopal Kurup will not speak about it.

1200
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:12,125
Nobody can make him do that.

1201
01:37:16,958 --> 01:37:17,875
Good!

1202
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:20,291
I like your confidence.

1203
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:21,875
Listen.

1204
01:37:22,166 --> 01:37:24,750
I'll be 75 in a month's time.

1205
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:29,333
Do you want to use third degree
methods on an old man?

1206
01:37:30,166 --> 01:37:31,541
You have more to lose than I do.

1207
01:37:32,291 --> 01:37:34,541
Don't you want to be promoted as SP?

1208
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:38,750
If you bully me and
something happens to me

1209
01:37:39,125 --> 01:37:41,208
then you will be in big trouble.

1210
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:43,625
Do you want that?

1211
01:37:44,166 --> 01:37:45,000
SP!

1212
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:46,791
Sounds good!

1213
01:37:48,125 --> 01:37:49,500
When I joined the police force…

1214
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:51,666
I wanted to bag the SI post.

1215
01:37:52,166 --> 01:37:53,208
And I got it!

1216
01:37:53,291 --> 01:37:54,916
I got more than what I wished for.

1217
01:37:55,458 --> 01:37:56,583
So I'm not afraid of anybody.

1218
01:37:57,166 --> 01:38:00,166
If you are afraid of third-degree methods,
then we can find another way.

1219
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:03,625
-Doesn't one come before three, Johnny?
-Yes, sir.

1220
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,333
Then let's start from one.

1221
01:38:12,541 --> 01:38:14,750
Don't compel him. You know how it is.

1222
01:38:16,125 --> 01:38:17,708
-You can start.
-Okay.

1223
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:25,583
Kurup?

1224
01:38:27,625 --> 01:38:28,458
Kurup?

1225
01:38:30,166 --> 01:38:31,000
Can you hear me?

1226
01:38:33,125 --> 01:38:35,583
When did you last see Sudhakara Kurup?

1227
01:38:40,083 --> 01:38:41,125
Where will you go now?

1228
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,125
I'll go to Uncle Vijay's house in Bhopal.

1229
01:38:48,041 --> 01:38:49,041
And then…

1230
01:38:49,958 --> 01:38:51,166
But I'm sure about one thing.

1231
01:38:51,541 --> 01:38:53,250
From now on, I decide who will see me.

1232
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:55,875
I don't care if it's police…

1233
01:38:56,833 --> 01:38:57,916
or politician.

1234
01:39:19,041 --> 01:39:20,291
I have only two questions for you.

1235
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,625
Where did he go? And when?

1236
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:24,583
It has been four days now.

1237
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:27,791
He left for Malini's house in Bombay.

1238
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,916
Don't you know it's a crime
to give shelter to a criminal?

1239
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:33,750
Yes, we know that, sir.

1240
01:39:34,166 --> 01:39:36,958
In fact, we had decided that
we will turn him out if he came.

1241
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:41,500
But after all… he is our boy.

1242
01:39:45,208 --> 01:39:46,333
I want to see the bedroom that he used.

1243
01:40:21,875 --> 01:40:24,208
-Is either of you diabetic?
-No, sir.

1244
01:40:25,041 --> 01:40:26,250
This is a prescription for insulin.

1245
01:40:27,083 --> 01:40:29,375
That must be Gopi's.

1246
01:40:42,125 --> 01:40:43,375
-You wait here.
-Okay.

1247
01:40:49,458 --> 01:40:51,375
-Hello. Police.
-Sir.

1248
01:40:52,791 --> 01:40:54,166
-Where is this from?
-Just a minute, bro.

1249
01:40:54,916 --> 01:40:56,875
Sir, this is prescribed from ward C.

1250
01:40:57,041 --> 01:40:58,541
Go straight and take left.

1251
01:40:58,791 --> 01:41:00,250
Are you sure it was him?

1252
01:41:00,666 --> 01:41:01,958
Yes, sir.
It's the same guy.

1253
01:41:03,666 --> 01:41:05,416
Do you remember how tall he was?

1254
01:41:06,375 --> 01:41:08,750
He wasn't as tall as you, sir.

1255
01:41:12,541 --> 01:41:13,750
This man is more than six feet tall.

1256
01:41:14,416 --> 01:41:15,375
You are mistaken.

1257
01:41:15,916 --> 01:41:17,125
Oh! Here it is.

1258
01:41:17,625 --> 01:41:18,625
Thank you.

1259
01:41:31,458 --> 01:41:34,208
WANTED
KURUP

1260
01:41:41,291 --> 01:41:42,291
Sir.

1261
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:45,916
These are letters from all the people

1262
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,958
who claim to have
seen Sudhakara Kurup.

1263
01:41:51,583 --> 01:41:53,625
You can throw out the anonymous letters.

1264
01:41:53,708 --> 01:41:56,833
I've done that, sir.
These are the remaining ones.

1265
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:57,958
{\an8}Frankly speaking…

1266
01:41:58,333 --> 01:42:01,125
{\an8}I don't know what to believe
and what not to believe.

1267
01:42:01,625 --> 01:42:03,041
{\an8}I can't tell the difference.

1268
01:42:04,666 --> 01:42:06,541
{\an8}P. KRISHNADAS

1269
01:42:08,166 --> 01:42:11,291
If there is truth in any of these,
it will find us eventually.

1270
01:42:30,375 --> 01:42:31,333
What is it, sir?

1271
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:34,291
{\an8}This letter not only mentions Kurup.

1272
01:42:35,875 --> 01:42:37,375
{\an8}It also refers to someone he met.

1273
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:40,458
{\an8}Issac.

1274
01:42:59,875 --> 01:43:00,833
He's up there.

1275
01:43:10,541 --> 01:43:11,458
Alright, thank you.

1276
01:43:11,833 --> 01:43:12,916
Bye.

1277
01:43:15,458 --> 01:43:17,458
Good evening, Mr. Issac.
How are you?

1278
01:43:18,375 --> 01:43:20,875
I'm Krishnadas from down south.

1279
01:43:21,458 --> 01:43:22,583
Kerala Police.

1280
01:43:24,708 --> 01:43:26,833
I was checking some
files from a few years ago.

1281
01:43:27,458 --> 01:43:29,458
I found something that
I could use to take you with me.

1282
01:43:32,208 --> 01:43:34,166
I'm ready to forget that
but on one condition.

1283
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:36,125
You have to forget Kurup.

1284
01:43:37,208 --> 01:43:38,333
Now you will talk.

1285
01:43:39,791 --> 01:43:41,166
And I will listen.

1286
01:43:44,125 --> 01:43:46,000
I know where Kurup is.

1287
01:43:47,541 --> 01:43:48,666
His whereabouts are in here.

1288
01:43:53,375 --> 01:43:54,458
Sharma?

1289
01:43:57,708 --> 01:43:58,750
Take him!

1290
01:43:59,625 --> 01:44:01,041
Come on, let's go.

1291
01:44:01,708 --> 01:44:03,875
Come on, take him with you.

1292
01:44:04,458 --> 01:44:06,000
-Let's go.
-What are you saying?

1293
01:44:07,041 --> 01:44:10,458
<i>We leave a trail on every path we take.</i>

1294
01:44:11,375 --> 01:44:13,083
<i>No crime can conceal it.</i>

1295
01:44:14,291 --> 01:44:18,666
<i>Not everyone who arrives</i>
<i>at a crime scene can detect it.</i>

1296
01:44:19,375 --> 01:44:22,666
<i>But the one who searches for it,</i>
<i>will certainly find that trail.</i>

1297
01:45:12,958 --> 01:45:15,500
-Are these your regular visitors?
-Yes, sir.

1298
01:45:15,791 --> 01:45:16,958
Johnny?

1299
01:45:18,125 --> 01:45:20,833
-What happened, sir?
-Royal Viking Line.

1300
01:45:21,125 --> 01:45:22,625
He plans to leave the country on a ship.

1301
01:45:22,875 --> 01:45:23,750
This is our last chance.

1302
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:25,416
We should get him before he gets away.

1303
01:45:25,708 --> 01:45:28,166
-Should we inform the local police?
-Yes, we should.

1304
01:45:32,041 --> 01:45:33,416
Stop!

1305
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:40,875
-Wait.
-Sir.

1306
01:45:41,333 --> 01:45:43,416
Do you see this man?
He is Kurup.

1307
01:45:43,625 --> 01:45:46,625
He is a dangerous criminal
with several cases against him.

1308
01:45:46,833 --> 01:45:48,250
Look at it carefully.

1309
01:45:48,875 --> 01:45:50,333
Search for him in every nook and corner.

1310
01:45:50,833 --> 01:45:52,875
He could be here in disguise.

1311
01:45:53,333 --> 01:45:54,666
Alright? You can go now.

1312
01:46:12,708 --> 01:46:14,708
-Johnny!
-Go and catch him!

1313
01:46:15,541 --> 01:46:16,833
Go!

1314
01:46:16,916 --> 01:46:19,625
-Don't let him run!
-Catch him! Move!

1315
01:46:19,708 --> 01:46:23,333
-Go! Catch him!
-Come on! Catch him!

1316
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,708
Police! We need to search
the ship for a suspect.

1317
01:46:27,791 --> 01:46:28,666
Alright.

1318
01:46:35,875 --> 01:46:36,833
Go and check over there.

1319
01:46:47,125 --> 01:46:48,416
Go and check over there.

1320
01:46:49,250 --> 01:46:51,666
-Check properly.
-You rascal!

1321
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:53,666
-Get him!
-Sir, we got him.

1322
01:46:54,083 --> 01:46:55,166
Sir, I'm not Kurup.

1323
01:46:55,583 --> 01:46:57,166
Believe me. I am not Kurup.

1324
01:46:57,375 --> 01:46:58,333
Who the hell are you?

1325
01:46:58,416 --> 01:47:00,500
I'm Hari Kumar from Goa.

1326
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:02,541
This is how I make a living.

1327
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,166
-Sir, then what about Kurup?
-I have a sermon in South Africa.

1328
01:47:05,833 --> 01:47:06,833
-Take him away.
-Sir.

1329
01:47:06,916 --> 01:47:07,958
Come on, you dog.

1330
01:47:08,041 --> 01:47:09,875
-Come.
-Take him away.

1331
01:47:13,041 --> 01:47:14,041
-Thank you, sir.
-Alright.

1332
01:47:14,291 --> 01:47:15,125
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1333
01:47:18,916 --> 01:47:19,916
Sir?

1334
01:47:20,125 --> 01:47:21,500
-Their driver is missing.
-Sir.

1335
01:47:21,958 --> 01:47:24,541
Sir, I'm a saint, a Godman.

1336
01:47:24,625 --> 01:47:25,833
Please let me go, sir.

1337
01:47:25,916 --> 01:47:27,416
-Really?
-Let me go.

1338
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:29,791
-Am I a fool?
-Let me go, sir.

1339
01:47:30,416 --> 01:47:31,291
Keep quiet!

1340
01:47:39,125 --> 01:47:42,500
<i>We stood there and watched as</i>
<i>the Royal Viking Line sailed away.</i>

1341
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:46,125
<i>A lot more had happened which</i>
<i>neither did I saw nor others knew about.</i>

1342
01:47:46,666 --> 01:47:49,125
<i>More pieces had to come</i>
<i>together to know the full story.</i>

1343
01:47:49,583 --> 01:47:51,958
<i>Moreover, it is he who needs</i>
<i>to tell us about.</i>

1344
01:47:52,041 --> 01:47:52,958
Can I get two cups of tea?

1345
01:47:54,083 --> 01:47:55,000
Brother?

1346
01:47:55,083 --> 01:47:56,083
Can I get a biscuit?

1347
01:47:56,916 --> 01:47:58,375
-How much do you want?
-Give me a packet of it.

1348
01:48:00,125 --> 01:48:01,125
I want one as well.

1349
01:48:01,208 --> 01:48:02,875
-Give me a cup of tea.
-Give me a cup of coffee.

1350
01:48:04,958 --> 01:48:07,291
-I don't want to go.
-I don't want to hear your excuses.

1351
01:48:08,125 --> 01:48:10,000
You ought to listen to me.

1352
01:48:10,083 --> 01:48:11,208
I don't want to join air force.

1353
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:12,958
Will you just walk in there?

1354
01:48:16,833 --> 01:48:18,708
Will you do well at least this time?

1355
01:48:18,791 --> 01:48:20,791
I promise I'll make it big, Uncle.

1356
01:48:36,416 --> 01:48:37,333
What happened, GK?

1357
01:48:38,416 --> 01:48:39,375
This place suffocates me.

1358
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:41,208
I'm getting out. You go back to sleep.

1359
01:48:41,291 --> 01:48:42,666
Don't be stupid, man.

1360
01:48:42,791 --> 01:48:45,291
They will catch you
no matter where you go.

1361
01:48:45,458 --> 01:48:47,250
-That's why I'm still here.
-Damn it!

1362
01:48:47,833 --> 01:48:49,916
If I were in my village, I would
have had Mangal's toddy,

1363
01:48:50,125 --> 01:48:52,541
then smoked a cigarette and relaxed.
But I am stuck here.

1364
01:48:52,875 --> 01:48:54,958
Are you allowed to go out at night?

1365
01:48:56,083 --> 01:48:57,250
What?

1366
01:48:58,125 --> 01:48:59,166
I sneak out.

1367
01:49:20,458 --> 01:49:21,291
One cigarette, bro.

1368
01:49:31,041 --> 01:49:34,666
Hey, let's name it
Indie Rock Fusion Festival.

1369
01:49:35,625 --> 01:49:38,083
-How is it?
-It's awesome!

1370
01:49:41,958 --> 01:49:42,958
Brother?

1371
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:45,125
Where can I get a bottle of rum?

1372
01:49:45,458 --> 01:49:47,958
You can't get it at this time.
Can we get one?

1373
01:49:48,041 --> 01:49:51,041
-It's difficult to get one now.
-No, you won't get it.

1374
01:49:52,666 --> 01:49:54,666
-Is there any place I could get one now?
-Now…

1375
01:49:55,041 --> 01:49:56,583
Yes, you can get it from that building.

1376
01:50:01,208 --> 01:50:03,000
-From the air force camp?
-Yeah.

1377
01:50:03,333 --> 01:50:04,458
That's where I'm coming from.

1378
01:50:06,208 --> 01:50:07,208
Smart guy!

1379
01:50:07,916 --> 01:50:10,791
So, you jumped out of
the sea to catch a fish?

1380
01:50:13,166 --> 01:50:15,708
There is nothing that you
can't find on your campus.

1381
01:50:17,166 --> 01:50:20,583
We pay threefold the price
to buy booze from there.

1382
01:50:20,666 --> 01:50:22,250
-Threefold?
-Yeah.

1383
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:24,416
Threefold!

1384
01:50:39,708 --> 01:50:40,791
Who's that?

1385
01:50:42,458 --> 01:50:44,083
Brother, can I get some rum?

1386
01:50:44,666 --> 01:50:46,458
-Rum?
-Yeah.

1387
01:50:47,166 --> 01:50:49,125
-How much?
-I would need…

1388
01:50:50,583 --> 01:50:53,083
-two bottles of it.
-Really?

1389
01:50:53,541 --> 01:50:54,541
Yes.

1390
01:51:02,583 --> 01:51:04,750
-You?
-Mr. Murthy!

1391
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:12,083
-Mr. Murthy.
-What?

1392
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:14,708
-I need three bottles today.
-Okay.

1393
01:51:22,708 --> 01:51:24,208
GK, what happened?

1394
01:51:24,333 --> 01:51:25,458
There are bugs in the air force.

1395
01:51:26,291 --> 01:51:27,583
-Bedbugs!
-Oh!

1396
01:51:37,166 --> 01:51:38,250
Hey, GK.

1397
01:51:39,375 --> 01:51:40,208
Here it is.

1398
01:51:40,291 --> 01:51:43,083
This isn't enough to
satisfy MCC's thirst.

1399
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:44,875
-Take it.
-Tell me when you need more.

1400
01:51:45,416 --> 01:51:46,291
Okay.

1401
01:51:46,375 --> 01:51:48,750
But I will need a small profit out of it.

1402
01:51:49,708 --> 01:51:52,000
-You can resell your share.
-Okay.

1403
01:51:53,375 --> 01:51:54,291
Here you go.

1404
01:51:55,083 --> 01:51:58,875
My dear Gopikrishnan, you
will turn me into a full-time crook.

1405
01:51:59,083 --> 01:52:00,625
-You are a crook already!
-Get lost!

1406
01:52:02,708 --> 01:52:04,000
I have lost my peace of mind.

1407
01:52:05,208 --> 01:52:07,625
It used to take four months
for me to sell so much booze.

1408
01:52:07,833 --> 01:52:09,500
But you sold it in just three weeks.

1409
01:52:10,291 --> 01:52:12,125
Gopikrishna, if you carry on
selling the booze

1410
01:52:12,208 --> 01:52:15,708
then I might have to start brewing
arrack for the officers here.

1411
01:52:15,958 --> 01:52:17,750
If you plan to brew arrack
then you can count me in.

1412
01:52:18,291 --> 01:52:19,291
But I need a commission fee.

1413
01:52:19,708 --> 01:52:21,125
Speaking of a commission fee…

1414
01:52:24,125 --> 01:52:26,208
-What is this?
-It's a superb pair of boots!

1415
01:52:26,833 --> 01:52:28,958
Why should only the
air force guys wear it?

1416
01:52:31,375 --> 01:52:32,250
Size eight.

1417
01:52:34,958 --> 01:52:36,625
It will fit everyone and not
just the air force guys.

1418
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:37,583
Here's the money.

1419
01:52:37,791 --> 01:52:39,291
-Alright.
-That's great.

1420
01:52:40,958 --> 01:52:41,958
That's not the only thing.

1421
01:52:42,666 --> 01:52:45,291
-I have found other things too.
-Really?

1422
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,125
Like what?

1423
01:52:48,166 --> 01:52:49,458
I'll tell you later.

1424
01:52:49,875 --> 01:52:50,708
Sir.

1425
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:54,000
I came here so that I can succeed in life.

1426
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,750
Sooner or later, I will.

1427
01:52:57,250 --> 01:52:59,458
I have a surprise for you in Bombay.

1428
01:53:00,083 --> 01:53:02,416
<i>I had just started living my dream</i>

1429
01:53:02,833 --> 01:53:05,750
<i>when that posting struck me</i>
<i>like a bolt of lightning.</i>

1430
01:53:06,166 --> 01:53:08,541
<i>Madras gave me new hopes</i>

1431
01:53:08,625 --> 01:53:12,000
<i>to go to Bombay,</i>
<i>the city of the Marathas.</i>

1432
01:53:23,666 --> 01:53:27,166
So… you are Gopikrishnan from Madras!

1433
01:53:27,375 --> 01:53:28,708
Yes, sir.

1434
01:53:29,041 --> 01:53:30,458
It's a little hot in here.

1435
01:53:30,791 --> 01:53:32,583
Shall we go out and talk?

1436
01:53:33,791 --> 01:53:35,791
Here, take this. Come.

1437
01:53:48,125 --> 01:53:49,750
-I hope everything is in order.
-Yes, sir.

1438
01:53:50,291 --> 01:53:51,583
-Gopikrishnan?
-Sir.

1439
01:53:51,666 --> 01:53:53,666
What are you staring at?
Just do your job.

1440
01:53:54,583 --> 01:53:55,583
Yes, sir.

1441
01:53:59,625 --> 01:54:00,916
-Mr. Gopikrishnan?
-Sir.

1442
01:54:01,083 --> 01:54:05,458
If you thought that a store assistant
can sit back and relax in the store,

1443
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:07,000
then, you got it wrong.

1444
01:54:07,375 --> 01:54:08,375
It doesn't work like that.

1445
01:54:12,833 --> 01:54:13,791
There…

1446
01:54:13,875 --> 01:54:15,958
That's the inventory register. Take it!

1447
01:54:20,583 --> 01:54:21,541
Open it up.

1448
01:54:22,541 --> 01:54:24,125
That's your goods received note.

1449
01:54:24,583 --> 01:54:26,250
You must record every
entry in the register.

1450
01:54:26,625 --> 01:54:27,958
Including rack numbers.

1451
01:54:28,625 --> 01:54:30,833
It's four o'clock now.
And I want it by seven.

1452
01:54:32,125 --> 01:54:33,583
If you get even one entry wrong…

1453
01:54:34,291 --> 01:54:35,500
I don't have to tell you anything, right?

1454
01:54:37,041 --> 01:54:39,041
And before you start,
I want your haircut done.

1455
01:54:43,791 --> 01:54:45,208
-Mr. Gopikrishnan?
-Sir.

1456
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:47,666
Welcome to the real world of pain!

1457
01:54:48,291 --> 01:54:50,333
Didn't Dominique mention about a surprise?

1458
01:54:51,250 --> 01:54:52,458
I'm the surprise.

1459
01:54:53,916 --> 01:54:54,916
Dismissed!

1460
01:55:02,041 --> 01:55:03,500
<i>I prayed to God</i>

1461
01:55:04,625 --> 01:55:07,666
<i>that not even my enemies</i>
<i>should be given a surprise like this.</i>

1462
01:55:08,958 --> 01:55:10,500
<i>But no God listens to the</i>
<i>prayers of an atheist like me!</i>

1463
01:55:11,458 --> 01:55:16,125
<i>As soon as I opened that</i>
<i>door, I proved myself wrong.</i>

1464
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:54,458
<i>Mastan…</i>

1465
01:55:54,541 --> 01:55:58,666
<i>Muthaliyar and Karim Lala ruled</i>
<i>over Bombay city.</i>

1466
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:00,708
<i>Now it's our Bombay as well.</i>

1467
01:56:01,666 --> 01:56:05,125
<i>That's me and my new-found friend.</i>

1468
01:56:05,666 --> 01:56:06,708
<i>Issac!</i>

1469
01:56:07,041 --> 01:56:12,500
<i>The further limit is you</i>

1470
01:56:12,833 --> 01:56:15,583
It has been found

1471
01:56:15,875 --> 01:56:19,041
-<i>And spun my dreams there</i>
-Keep this over there.

1472
01:56:19,333 --> 01:56:24,583
<i>No matter what</i>

1473
01:56:24,875 --> 01:56:27,416
<i>Difficulty may come</i>

1474
01:56:27,583 --> 01:56:30,208
<i>I will look into it</i>

1475
01:56:30,291 --> 01:56:33,375
<i>We will win</i>

1476
01:56:37,041 --> 01:56:39,666
<i>Tomorrow will</i>

1477
01:56:40,041 --> 01:56:44,083
<i>Bring a change in our lives</i>

1478
01:56:45,333 --> 01:56:46,666
The war is over.

1479
01:56:48,875 --> 01:56:50,375
Congratulations, GK.

1480
01:56:50,458 --> 01:56:51,583
There is a new bounty.

1481
01:56:52,958 --> 01:56:54,500
A Singapore consignment.

1482
01:56:56,291 --> 01:56:57,333
Shall I go ahead with it?

1483
01:57:02,041 --> 01:57:03,041
What happened, GK?

1484
01:57:06,083 --> 01:57:08,041
We have been taking
commissions until now.

1485
01:57:09,916 --> 01:57:11,541
Let's play a new game.

1486
01:57:12,958 --> 01:57:14,708
You will get your commission from me.

1487
01:57:15,166 --> 01:57:17,291
But not as the tenth man
in a match of 11 players.

1488
01:57:17,916 --> 01:57:19,750
You will be the first
man of your match.

1489
01:57:20,458 --> 01:57:21,416
Do you see this?

1490
01:57:22,250 --> 01:57:23,416
This is our trump card.

1491
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,333
What is so special about it?

1492
01:57:25,916 --> 01:57:27,916
What is the connection between
winning a war and a commission?

1493
01:57:28,458 --> 01:57:33,041
Our country has bought weapons
worth crores for the sake of war.

1494
01:57:33,958 --> 01:57:36,916
Now that the war is over,
they will be stashed away.

1495
01:57:37,958 --> 01:57:41,333
Their sorting and accounting is…
more or less my responsibility.

1496
01:57:44,708 --> 01:57:47,791
If you try hard, I'm
sure we can find buyers.

1497
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Right?

1498
01:57:52,625 --> 01:57:54,375
<i>I was used to preying on small fish.</i>

1499
01:57:55,625 --> 01:57:58,333
<i>Issac gave me the boat and</i>
<i>nets to hunt for giant sharks.</i>

1500
01:57:59,041 --> 01:58:01,666
<i>My first catch turned out to be this man.</i>

1501
01:58:01,916 --> 01:58:05,541
<i>An underworld arms dealer</i>
<i>called Leo Ragnor.</i>

1502
01:58:06,666 --> 01:58:09,500
<i>Thanks a million, Issac!</i>

1503
01:58:12,833 --> 01:58:14,125
Keep them over here.

1504
01:58:14,833 --> 01:58:15,958
Make it quick.

1505
01:58:17,791 --> 01:58:19,833
Only eight more boxes, after that done.

1506
01:58:26,958 --> 01:58:29,750
-What are you doing here?
-Sir, these are the rejected goods.

1507
01:58:30,875 --> 01:58:32,750
-So I'm sending them back.
-Do you have the documents?

1508
01:58:33,208 --> 01:58:34,333
-Yes, sir, it's in the jeep.
-Show them to me.

1509
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:52,541
Alright.

1510
01:58:53,208 --> 01:58:54,458
-Carry on.
-Thank you, sir.

1511
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,291
Goodnight, sir.

1512
01:59:01,375 --> 01:59:02,708
That was well played!

1513
01:59:03,958 --> 01:59:05,875
Let me know if you
are interested to join us.

1514
01:59:06,041 --> 01:59:07,916
Yeah, let me get my termination letter.

1515
01:59:08,625 --> 01:59:11,958
-Hope that's not too far.
-Hey, Leo, we will lose all our business.

1516
01:59:14,666 --> 01:59:15,875
Guys, hurry up.

1517
01:59:16,375 --> 01:59:17,541
Where is the stock in here?

1518
01:59:18,041 --> 01:59:20,000
How many times have I
told you to verify them?

1519
01:59:20,250 --> 01:59:22,291
-Did you do it?
-Sir, all stock--

1520
01:59:22,375 --> 01:59:23,541
Stop giving stories!

1521
01:59:24,833 --> 01:59:26,666
Full inventory with details.

1522
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:29,250
I want it in a week. Is that clear?

1523
01:59:30,541 --> 01:59:32,541
Sir, one week is very less time.

1524
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:33,750
Shut up!

1525
01:59:34,041 --> 01:59:35,250
This is the Indian Air force.

1526
01:59:35,625 --> 01:59:38,125
This uniform demands honesty and respect.

1527
01:59:38,291 --> 01:59:40,291
And it comes with
integrity and discipline.

1528
01:59:40,666 --> 01:59:43,000
This is not a place for losers and liars.

1529
01:59:43,416 --> 01:59:44,416
Do you get me?

1530
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:46,666
-Yes, sir.
-Get out!

1531
02:00:02,041 --> 02:00:04,541
-What do I order?
-Just order something.

1532
02:00:31,458 --> 02:00:32,625
I'm going home tomorrow.

1533
02:00:33,833 --> 02:00:36,958
I got sick leave… for a month.

1534
02:00:38,583 --> 02:00:40,083
Place it properly.

1535
02:00:44,291 --> 02:00:46,500
-We are here for an investigation.
-Tell me.

1536
02:00:46,583 --> 02:00:48,875
-Are you related to Gopikrishnan Kurup?
-I'm his father.

1537
02:00:49,333 --> 02:00:50,541
Gopikrishnan?

1538
02:00:51,083 --> 02:00:52,166
He is no more, sir.

1539
02:00:53,416 --> 02:00:55,375
He was very ill when he came here.

1540
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:59,291
I'll go and check with the neighbors.

1541
02:00:59,708 --> 02:01:01,750
-You stay right here, okay?
-Yes.

1542
02:01:09,041 --> 02:01:10,041
Excuse me.

1543
02:01:11,625 --> 02:01:14,041
Did you hear about your
neighbor Gopikrishnan's death?

1544
02:01:14,125 --> 02:01:15,500
We were in Bhopal.

1545
02:01:15,666 --> 02:01:17,166
We came as soon as we got the news.

1546
02:01:18,041 --> 02:01:19,333
That's a lie, sir.

1547
02:01:20,208 --> 02:01:21,708
I met him at the field yesterday.

1548
02:01:22,541 --> 02:01:23,541
He was cutting the leaves.

1549
02:01:24,333 --> 02:01:26,333
Keep your voice down or he will hear you.

1550
02:01:27,125 --> 02:01:29,125
By the way, how did
you persuade your father?

1551
02:01:29,833 --> 02:01:33,458
Doesn't every God have a weak
spot that he is afraid of?

1552
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:37,375
What exactly do you gain
from your death certificate?

1553
02:01:38,250 --> 02:01:39,458
I'm done with the air force.

1554
02:01:39,833 --> 02:01:42,625
Once they get this certificate,
they won't come looking for me.

1555
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:45,291
-Shall we go?
-Yeah.

1556
02:01:46,166 --> 02:01:47,583
-Alright, goodbye.
-See you.

1557
02:02:01,333 --> 02:02:03,375
I WILL BE AT THE SUBWAY

1558
02:02:06,041 --> 02:02:08,375
{\an8}ARYA SAMAJ TEMPLE, BOMBAY

1559
02:02:23,208 --> 02:02:24,208
Leo!

1560
02:02:24,458 --> 02:02:26,291
That's the guy I told you about.

1561
02:02:27,166 --> 02:02:28,166
Hold this.

1562
02:02:28,708 --> 02:02:30,750
-Hello, my friend.
-How are you?

1563
02:02:31,666 --> 02:02:33,666
Welcome to the city of black gold!

1564
02:02:34,125 --> 02:02:34,958
Thank you.

1565
02:02:35,083 --> 02:02:36,500
-My wife, Sharada.
-Hi!

1566
02:02:37,083 --> 02:02:38,416
<i>The people of my village envied me.</i>

1567
02:02:39,958 --> 02:02:41,166
<i>But I don't blame them for it.</i>

1568
02:02:41,791 --> 02:02:43,666
-<i>It's because I held the title of</i>
-Good morning.

1569
02:02:43,750 --> 02:02:45,208
<i>Progress Assistant in</i>
<i>an oil company in Persia.</i>

1570
02:02:45,291 --> 02:02:47,708
-Greetings.
-<i>And I earned a five-digit salary.</i>

1571
02:02:47,791 --> 02:02:49,916
-Good morning, Daisy.
-<i>But the price that I had set</i>

1572
02:02:50,291 --> 02:02:52,208
<i>for myself was much greater than that.</i>

1573
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,333
Here, take him. I'll be right back.

1574
02:03:03,333 --> 02:03:04,708
-Hi, Leo.
-Hey.

1575
02:03:04,875 --> 02:03:05,708
What's new?

1576
02:03:05,791 --> 02:03:07,791
-Remember the prince I told you about?
-Yeah.

1577
02:03:08,041 --> 02:03:08,916
That's the guy.

1578
02:03:14,291 --> 02:03:15,791
-How is she?
-Very nice.

1579
02:03:20,083 --> 02:03:21,000
<i>This is Walid.</i>

1580
02:03:21,541 --> 02:03:24,083
<i>He was one of the</i>
<i>richest princes of Persia.</i>

1581
02:03:25,041 --> 02:03:28,791
<i>It took me two-and-a-half</i>
<i>years to reach out to him.</i>

1582
02:03:43,666 --> 02:03:45,000
Come on! Do it!

1583
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,125
-No brakes!
-What?

1584
02:04:00,208 --> 02:04:01,041
No brakes!

1585
02:04:01,125 --> 02:04:03,000
-Try again.
-No brakes!

1586
02:04:03,833 --> 02:04:05,666
-Drive off-road! Here!
-No!

1587
02:04:06,708 --> 02:04:08,041
The car may overturn.

1588
02:04:08,333 --> 02:04:09,750
There is only one way now.

1589
02:04:09,875 --> 02:04:11,333
You should jump at the count of three.

1590
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:12,333
One…

1591
02:04:12,791 --> 02:04:14,291
two… three!

1592
02:04:14,416 --> 02:04:16,125
Three! Jump!

1593
02:04:17,541 --> 02:04:18,541
Jump!

1594
02:04:36,458 --> 02:04:37,458
Obedient!

1595
02:04:38,291 --> 02:04:40,958
The king wants me
to stay out of business.

1596
02:04:41,208 --> 02:04:42,125
I know I'm young.

1597
02:04:42,916 --> 02:04:46,916
But I'm not so naive
when it comes to business.

1598
02:04:48,458 --> 02:04:49,833
Everyone is trying their luck.

1599
02:04:50,250 --> 02:04:51,208
Why should I stay away?

1600
02:04:52,041 --> 02:04:54,791
<i>The thing is that Walid liked me a lot.</i>

1601
02:04:55,083 --> 02:04:57,333
<i>Being the prince's sidekick means…</i>

1602
02:04:57,583 --> 02:04:59,583
<i>being as powerful as our chief minister.</i>

1603
02:04:59,666 --> 02:05:04,416
<i>This is the best translation</i>
<i>I can give while I catch my breath.</i>

1604
02:05:08,875 --> 02:05:09,875
Thank you.

1605
02:05:10,125 --> 02:05:11,125
Greet him, dear.

1606
02:05:11,916 --> 02:05:13,083
Boss!

1607
02:05:15,958 --> 02:05:17,041
-Assalamu alaikum, sir.
-Good to see you.

1608
02:05:17,125 --> 02:05:19,208
-I am fine. Please sit inside.
-Thank you.

1609
02:05:19,958 --> 02:05:20,958
Come.

1610
02:05:23,666 --> 02:05:24,666
Will you please manage?

1611
02:05:25,250 --> 02:05:26,375
Dad will be right back, son.

1612
02:05:28,416 --> 02:05:29,666
Shyamu, serve these to the
ones sitting outside.

1613
02:05:30,208 --> 02:05:31,458
I will call you if I need something.

1614
02:05:36,166 --> 02:05:37,750
<i>Walid entrusted me with a job that day.</i>

1615
02:05:38,625 --> 02:05:40,333
<i>The job of a true Satan.</i>

1616
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,458
<i>I'm not that great…</i>

1617
02:05:43,875 --> 02:05:45,083
<i>to turn down that offer.</i>

1618
02:05:45,916 --> 02:05:47,083
Yes, boss.

1619
02:05:49,250 --> 02:05:50,708
-Shyamu.
-Sir?

1620
02:05:51,541 --> 02:05:52,458
Give me a number.

1621
02:05:52,750 --> 02:05:53,750
Number?

1622
02:05:54,458 --> 02:05:55,458
Eight.

1623
02:06:02,083 --> 02:06:03,916
Noushad, I need two
tickets to Kerala next month.

1624
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,833
-<i>Date of travel, sir?</i>
-On the fourth.

1625
02:06:06,416 --> 02:06:08,708
-<i>Alright.</i>
-It's for Shyamu and me.

1626
02:06:08,791 --> 02:06:09,625
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

1627
02:06:09,708 --> 02:06:12,000
-<i>What about your return?</i>
-Return…

1628
02:06:12,791 --> 02:06:14,166
-Only Shyamu needs a return ticket.
-<i>Okay, sir.</i>

1629
02:06:14,375 --> 02:06:15,500
I'll inform the date later.

1630
02:06:15,791 --> 02:06:17,041
-First class, okay?
-<i>Sure, sir.</i>

1631
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:18,875
Alright.

1632
02:06:30,375 --> 02:06:31,375
What's this?

1633
02:06:33,875 --> 02:06:34,708
Haven't you read it?

1634
02:06:35,125 --> 02:06:36,208
That's why I want to know.

1635
02:06:39,333 --> 02:06:40,333
Don't raise your voice.

1636
02:06:42,041 --> 02:06:44,166
I took a life insurance. Any problem?

1637
02:06:44,916 --> 02:06:46,833
Why do you need life insurance now?

1638
02:06:53,916 --> 02:06:55,375
All of us have to die someday, right?

1639
02:06:56,750 --> 02:06:57,791
Don't think too much about it.

1640
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:07,375
I have a life insurance policy in Persia.

1641
02:07:08,666 --> 02:07:09,916
Why don't we claim it?

1642
02:07:10,041 --> 02:07:11,166
Why not?

1643
02:07:11,416 --> 02:07:12,541
I want a body double.

1644
02:07:13,208 --> 02:07:15,000
A corpse of the same height and build.

1645
02:07:15,916 --> 02:07:18,208
So if Gopikrishnan could
become Sudhakara Kurup…

1646
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:21,000
then in no time…

1647
02:07:21,375 --> 02:07:23,500
Sudhakara Kurup will be
reborn as somebody else.

1648
02:07:29,041 --> 02:07:31,041
Are you doing it in here?

1649
02:07:32,541 --> 02:07:33,833
We will burn the face now.

1650
02:07:34,833 --> 02:07:36,000
The body can be burned somewhere else.

1651
02:07:42,375 --> 02:07:43,958
Your return ticket is booked
for the tenth of next month.

1652
02:07:44,458 --> 02:07:47,166
-Let me see if I can prepone it.
-Okay, sir.

1653
02:07:49,791 --> 02:07:50,708
Sir?

1654
02:07:50,833 --> 02:07:53,583
Don't leave your house
until the matter clears up.

1655
02:07:53,666 --> 02:07:54,666
Okay, sir.

1656
02:08:28,041 --> 02:08:29,083
Sir, here is the blade.

1657
02:08:45,125 --> 02:08:46,333
Kurup is in there, sir.

1658
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:48,000
-Room number 122.
-Okay.

1659
02:08:51,208 --> 02:08:53,208
Brother?

1660
02:08:53,791 --> 02:08:55,791
-Hey, break it down.
-Sir.

1661
02:08:58,166 --> 02:08:59,583
-Move.
-Sir.

1662
02:09:05,083 --> 02:09:06,458
Sir, he is not here.

1663
02:09:14,750 --> 02:09:16,250
-Check downstairs. Quick!
-Yes, sir.

1664
02:09:53,625 --> 02:09:55,708
-Kurup has an acquaintance in Mannar.
-Sir.

1665
02:09:55,875 --> 02:09:57,250
It could be a relative or a friend.

1666
02:09:57,333 --> 02:09:58,625
-Find out who it is.
-Yes, sir.

1667
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,625
-Make it quick! Right now.
-Sure, sir!

1668
02:10:02,458 --> 02:10:04,208
POLICE

1669
02:10:04,750 --> 02:10:05,750
Let's go.

1670
02:10:34,875 --> 02:10:36,416
Sir, you are still here.

1671
02:10:51,791 --> 02:10:53,833
You must have to spend a lot
of money to call the police.

1672
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:56,625
Keep this with you.

1673
02:11:07,041 --> 02:11:09,333
-Hello
-<i>Hello, is this Krishnadas sir's office?</i>

1674
02:11:09,416 --> 02:11:11,041
-Yes.
-<i>Is sir there?</i>

1675
02:11:11,125 --> 02:11:12,000
Who is calling?

1676
02:11:12,083 --> 02:11:14,583
<i>This is from the Postal Department.</i>
<i>Is sir there?</i>

1677
02:11:14,833 --> 02:11:15,791
No.

1678
02:11:15,875 --> 02:11:18,041
-<i>When can I talk to him?</i>
-I don't know.

1679
02:11:18,666 --> 02:11:20,041
<i>It's an urgent matter.</i>

1680
02:11:20,541 --> 02:11:21,750
<i>Can you tell me when he will be back?</i>

1681
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,416
I told you I don't know.
Sir is in Bhopal now.

1682
02:11:25,333 --> 02:11:26,333
<i>Really? What's he doing there, sir?</i>

1683
02:11:26,750 --> 02:11:28,791
He went to nab Sudhakara Kurup.

1684
02:11:29,083 --> 02:11:29,916
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

1685
02:11:30,250 --> 02:11:31,166
<i>I'll hang up.</i>

1686
02:11:31,250 --> 02:11:32,083
Hello?

1687
02:11:32,166 --> 02:11:34,458
I'll inform sir when he is back.
What's your name?

1688
02:11:34,541 --> 02:11:36,458
<i>Tell him Kurup called from Bhopal.</i>

1689
02:11:37,083 --> 02:11:38,083
-Who?
-Kurup.

1690
02:11:38,791 --> 02:11:40,291
Sudhakara Kurup.

1691
02:11:44,625 --> 02:11:47,166
To hell with Sudhakara Kurup!
Hang down, you idiot!

1692
02:11:49,583 --> 02:11:50,666
Bhopal!

1693
02:11:56,875 --> 02:11:58,875
-Hey.
-Yeah.

1694
02:11:59,833 --> 02:12:02,750
Gopikrishnan's news
has reached Bhopal as well.

1695
02:12:02,916 --> 02:12:05,000
You should ask him to leave.

1696
02:12:05,458 --> 02:12:06,333
Gopi!

1697
02:12:06,791 --> 02:12:07,791
Gopi!

1698
02:12:09,125 --> 02:12:10,125
Gopi!

1699
02:12:10,916 --> 02:12:11,958
Gopi!

1700
02:12:12,750 --> 02:12:13,750
Gopi!

1701
02:12:15,333 --> 02:12:18,250
-He is not in here.
-He has already left with his things.

1702
02:12:18,458 --> 02:12:19,791
Please keep this.

1703
02:12:19,958 --> 02:12:22,958
-Look at the rates of the--
-Greetings.

1704
02:12:25,416 --> 02:12:26,416
Aunt.

1705
02:12:27,208 --> 02:12:28,833
Why did you come here?

1706
02:12:29,416 --> 02:12:31,208
The police are looking for you.

1707
02:12:31,875 --> 02:12:32,958
Do you want to drag us into it?

1708
02:12:34,541 --> 02:12:36,416
You were always reckless and brash.

1709
02:12:36,541 --> 02:12:37,791
Now look where you ended up.

1710
02:12:38,291 --> 02:12:40,708
Do you have the guts
to kill someone, Gopi?

1711
02:12:41,583 --> 02:12:43,125
Do you think I will do such a thing?

1712
02:12:43,750 --> 02:12:44,750
Listen to me.

1713
02:12:45,583 --> 02:12:46,666
-Aunt.
-Yes.

1714
02:12:46,958 --> 02:12:48,916
You have to stop reading
the newspaper to know the truth.

1715
02:12:50,083 --> 02:12:52,125
It's true that I told them to
get a corpse from the mortuary.

1716
02:12:52,791 --> 02:12:54,208
But I didn't tell them to kill anybody.

1717
02:12:54,583 --> 02:12:55,833
Neither did I kill anyone.

1718
02:12:56,375 --> 02:12:57,416
But now…

1719
02:12:57,708 --> 02:13:00,125
everybody thinks that I'm
the mastermind behind it.

1720
02:13:01,541 --> 02:13:02,416
What about Sharada?

1721
02:13:03,291 --> 02:13:04,333
She is back home.

1722
02:13:05,833 --> 02:13:07,625
Why don't you call Vijay in Bhopal?

1723
02:13:07,916 --> 02:13:09,250
-Do you have his number?
-No, thanks.

1724
02:13:09,833 --> 02:13:11,541
-That's where I'm coming from.
-What happened?

1725
02:13:12,458 --> 02:13:14,000
I left before they kicked me out.

1726
02:13:16,333 --> 02:13:17,333
What will you do now?

1727
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:19,041
I won't bother you.

1728
02:13:19,791 --> 02:13:21,500
I haven't eaten anything for days.

1729
02:13:22,625 --> 02:13:24,333
Can I stay at your place for one day?

1730
02:13:24,875 --> 02:13:25,875
Just one day!

1731
02:13:29,166 --> 02:13:30,166
Come.

1732
02:13:41,791 --> 02:13:42,875
Have some more rice.

1733
02:13:51,333 --> 02:13:56,291
<i>Come and embrace me</i>
<i>Don't delay now</i>

1734
02:13:56,666 --> 02:14:01,333
<i>Let's make this cold night</i>
<i>Into a steamy one</i>

1735
02:14:01,916 --> 02:14:03,458
<i>The twinkling stars…</i>

1736
02:14:03,541 --> 02:14:05,208
He must have gone to Malini's house
in Bombay.

1737
02:14:05,291 --> 02:14:09,291
<i>To distant lands unknown</i>

1738
02:14:09,625 --> 02:14:10,625
Bye, Aunt.

1739
02:14:12,583 --> 02:14:14,666
<i>These times never end</i>

1740
02:14:14,750 --> 02:14:17,750
<i>But besiege like darkness</i>

1741
02:14:17,916 --> 02:14:21,208
<i>I am not in my limits</i>

1742
02:14:21,291 --> 02:14:24,541
<i>Curbing myself</i>

1743
02:14:24,625 --> 02:14:27,208
<i>Is a difficult thing to do</i>

1744
02:14:27,625 --> 02:14:31,083
<i>Oh, my beloved</i>

1745
02:14:31,166 --> 02:14:33,166
<i>What kind of love is this?</i>

1746
02:14:33,250 --> 02:14:36,291
<i>It's full of peace and pain</i>

1747
02:14:36,666 --> 02:14:39,041
<i>It's full of different aspects</i>

1748
02:14:39,333 --> 02:14:41,541
<i>I am full of restlessness</i>

1749
02:14:41,625 --> 02:14:44,250
<i>Tell me what I should do now</i>

1750
02:14:44,375 --> 02:14:46,791
<i>It's full of peace and pain</i>

1751
02:14:47,333 --> 02:14:49,666
<i>It's full of different aspects</i>

1752
02:14:49,958 --> 02:14:52,125
<i>I am full of restlessness</i>

1753
02:14:52,208 --> 02:14:55,125
<i>Tell me what I should do now</i>

1754
02:15:13,791 --> 02:15:14,750
Yes.

1755
02:15:17,416 --> 02:15:19,166
Kurup called me yesterday.

1756
02:15:20,166 --> 02:15:21,416
He is in Bombay now.

1757
02:15:22,333 --> 02:15:25,083
He wants me to help him meet Sharada.

1758
02:15:27,375 --> 02:15:28,250
What is it, sir?

1759
02:15:28,833 --> 02:15:30,916
Is Kurup foolish enough to trust you?

1760
02:15:32,750 --> 02:15:34,833
Where will Kurup meet Sharada?
In jail?

1761
02:15:36,958 --> 02:15:41,916
<i>Come and embrace me</i>
<i>Don't delay anymore</i>

1762
02:15:42,208 --> 02:15:47,083
<i>Let's make this cold night</i>
<i>Into a steamy one</i>

1763
02:15:47,375 --> 02:15:52,125
<i>Until the twinkling stars appear</i>

1764
02:15:52,208 --> 02:15:57,041
<i>To distant lands unknown</i>

1765
02:15:58,083 --> 02:16:00,083
<i>The difficult times</i>

1766
02:16:00,416 --> 02:16:02,416
Hey 210, is that Kurup?

1767
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:05,166
No, it's that guy who helps the old lady.

1768
02:16:05,416 --> 02:16:09,625
<i>The storm doesn't end but</i>
<i>We still have some hope</i>

1769
02:16:10,208 --> 02:16:12,958
The times will change

1770
02:16:13,041 --> 02:16:16,583
For me as well

1771
02:16:16,666 --> 02:16:18,666
<i>What kind of love is this?</i>

1772
02:16:18,750 --> 02:16:21,708
<i>It's full of peace and pain</i>

1773
02:16:21,875 --> 02:16:24,416
<i>It's full of different aspects</i>

1774
02:16:24,791 --> 02:16:27,041
<i>I am full of restlessness</i>

1775
02:16:27,125 --> 02:16:29,708
<i>Tell me what I should do now</i>

1776
02:16:29,791 --> 02:16:32,291
<i>It's full of peace and pain</i>

1777
02:16:32,708 --> 02:16:35,000
<i>It's full of different aspects</i>

1778
02:16:35,416 --> 02:16:37,708
<i>I am full of restlessness</i>

1779
02:16:37,791 --> 02:16:40,833
<i>Tell me what I should do now</i>

1780
02:16:41,125 --> 02:16:42,916
I'll inform you as soon as Leo calls me.

1781
02:16:44,750 --> 02:16:46,166
What are you staring at? Get out!

1782
02:17:10,583 --> 02:17:12,583
<i>Leo chose a country for me to get away.</i>

1783
02:17:13,166 --> 02:17:16,041
<i>And he gave the tickets to Issac.</i>

1784
02:17:17,458 --> 02:17:19,083
{\an8}<i>But before I could reach there,</i>

1785
02:17:20,208 --> 02:17:21,166
{\an8}-<i>the police arrived on my trail.</i>
-Hey, leave me.

1786
02:17:25,208 --> 02:17:26,208
Brother, give me a cup of tea.

1787
02:17:26,833 --> 02:17:27,666
Here you go.

1788
02:17:32,416 --> 02:17:34,291
-What happened, brother?
-Hey, Shakil.

1789
02:17:34,375 --> 02:17:36,083
He is our aide.
There isn't a problem.

1790
02:17:36,291 --> 02:17:37,291
Okay, brother.

1791
02:17:45,333 --> 02:17:47,333
<i>I don't know where I should go from here.</i>

1792
02:17:48,375 --> 02:17:51,041
<i>It's because Krishnadas</i>
<i>knows where to find me.</i>

1793
02:17:52,791 --> 02:17:54,625
<i>So from now, the police won't chase Kurup.</i>

1794
02:17:56,125 --> 02:17:57,958
<i>Instead Kurup will chase the police.</i>

1795
02:18:02,541 --> 02:18:03,541
Let's go.

1796
02:18:13,916 --> 02:18:16,458
-Brother, follow that vehicle.
-Okay.

1797
02:18:21,541 --> 02:18:24,250
<i>Beneath the blue sea</i>

1798
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:27,000
<i>Traversing the deep shore</i>

1799
02:18:27,416 --> 02:18:29,958
<i>Ahead of the time</i>

1800
02:18:30,416 --> 02:18:32,750
<i>You will go ahead</i>

1801
02:18:32,833 --> 02:18:34,833
<i>He is like a submarine</i>

1802
02:18:36,250 --> 02:18:38,333
<i>A submarine</i>

1803
02:18:50,833 --> 02:18:53,500
<i>In the deep sea where the waves sway</i>

1804
02:18:53,708 --> 02:18:56,250
<i>This journey seems unending</i>

1805
02:18:56,791 --> 02:18:59,500
<i>The shore looks a long way away</i>

1806
02:18:59,625 --> 02:19:03,083
Stop the car! Get out of the car.

1807
02:19:04,208 --> 02:19:05,083
All clear.

1808
02:19:07,208 --> 02:19:08,875
-Stop!
-Explain it to them.

1809
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,875
Attention, everyone.
This is Kurup.

1810
02:19:12,041 --> 02:19:13,666
Look at the sketch carefully.

1811
02:19:14,083 --> 02:19:15,041
You can leave now.

1812
02:19:25,125 --> 02:19:26,666
POLICE

1813
02:19:37,375 --> 02:19:38,208
Check over there.

1814
02:19:38,291 --> 02:19:39,208
-I will check here.
-Yes, sir.

1815
02:19:40,375 --> 02:19:41,791
Over there.

1816
02:19:43,333 --> 02:19:45,958
<i>Ahead of time</i>

1817
02:19:46,291 --> 02:19:48,958
<i>You need to pass it</i>

1818
02:19:49,041 --> 02:19:51,916
<i>He is like a submarine</i>

1819
02:19:52,250 --> 02:19:54,250
<i>A submarine!</i>

1820
02:21:22,666 --> 02:21:24,166
-Go and check there.
-Okay, sir.

1821
02:21:49,291 --> 02:21:51,125
-Oh, no!
-Stop right there!

1822
02:21:51,750 --> 02:21:52,875
Catch him!

1823
02:22:10,208 --> 02:22:11,125
Sir.

1824
02:22:11,250 --> 02:22:12,625
The driver is missing.

1825
02:22:22,458 --> 02:22:24,125
<i>When that car went up in flames</i>

1826
02:22:24,833 --> 02:22:28,791
<i>everybody thought it was a fool's</i>
<i>plan to swipe eight lakh rupees.</i>

1827
02:22:30,375 --> 02:22:31,208
<i>But…</i>

1828
02:22:31,791 --> 02:22:32,833
<i>was that the truth?</i>

1829
02:22:38,125 --> 02:22:39,291
I didn't ask for coffee.

1830
02:22:46,833 --> 02:22:47,791
What's my new name?

1831
02:22:50,666 --> 02:22:51,666
Alexander.

1832
02:22:58,625 --> 02:23:01,333
<i>The fourth son of the sultan's</i>
<i>third wife had realized that</i>

1833
02:23:01,625 --> 02:23:04,416
<i>his status was no better</i>
<i>than that of a corpse.</i>

1834
02:23:04,875 --> 02:23:08,083
<i>So, Walid set out to become</i>
<i>as strong as the sultan himself.</i>

1835
02:23:11,083 --> 02:23:12,541
<i>The black gold aka crude oil!</i>

1836
02:23:13,166 --> 02:23:14,583
<i>That was Walid's investment.</i>

1837
02:23:15,500 --> 02:23:17,958
<i>My job was to smuggle it</i>

1838
02:23:18,541 --> 02:23:19,875
<i>without the sultan's knowledge.</i>

1839
02:23:20,625 --> 02:23:23,125
<i>That means my life itself…</i>
<i>was my investment.</i>

1840
02:23:23,500 --> 02:23:25,958
<i>And I decided to risk</i>
<i>my life for the same.</i>

1841
02:23:42,666 --> 02:23:45,708
<i>Walid kept receiving</i>
<i>double the market price.</i>

1842
02:23:45,916 --> 02:23:46,916
<i>But what about me?</i>

1843
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:48,375
<i>I got the mere bones that he threw at me.</i>

1844
02:23:51,041 --> 02:23:52,041
Thank you.

1845
02:23:54,291 --> 02:23:57,291
But boss, my next deal…
is very big.

1846
02:23:57,916 --> 02:23:59,166
Three million US dollar.

1847
02:23:59,583 --> 02:24:01,541
But… risk is…

1848
02:24:02,583 --> 02:24:03,416
also very big.

1849
02:24:03,583 --> 02:24:05,250
When was the last time you saw
one of the royals in jail?

1850
02:24:06,125 --> 02:24:08,333
-So, the risk is only yours.
-<i>He was right.</i>

1851
02:24:09,125 --> 02:24:11,708
<i>Not a single person of the royal</i>
<i>bloodline had ever gone to jail.</i>

1852
02:24:11,875 --> 02:24:12,833
<i>Risk!</i>

1853
02:24:13,041 --> 02:24:14,500
<i>It was entirely mine.</i>

1854
02:24:15,041 --> 02:24:18,666
<i>So, I decided to take</i>
<i>a risk for the last time.</i>

1855
02:24:19,541 --> 02:24:22,416
<i>I swiped three million US dollars</i>
<i>from the sultan.</i>

1856
02:24:23,250 --> 02:24:26,666
<i>However… I didn't take the</i>
<i>money to Walid this time.</i>

1857
02:24:29,083 --> 02:24:30,083
Shyamu.

1858
02:24:31,250 --> 02:24:34,458
We shouldn't insist on getting
only frozen bodies from the morgue.

1859
02:24:35,666 --> 02:24:38,333
If they look hard…
they can find it otherwise.

1860
02:24:38,625 --> 02:24:39,791
That can be done, sir.

1861
02:24:40,500 --> 02:24:42,333
But we need the right men for the job.

1862
02:24:45,833 --> 02:24:46,875
That's our guy.

1863
02:24:47,125 --> 02:24:48,541
He will do anything for his friends.

1864
02:24:48,625 --> 02:24:50,041
But if he loses it, he
will not spare you as well.

1865
02:24:50,666 --> 02:24:51,500
He'll be of use to us.

1866
02:24:52,875 --> 02:24:55,250
So, how do we persuade
him to kill someone?

1867
02:24:55,916 --> 02:24:56,875
I think I know that.

1868
02:25:01,166 --> 02:25:03,458
We can't go to my place.
Let's go to your place.

1869
02:25:05,416 --> 02:25:06,500
Hurry up!

1870
02:25:21,791 --> 02:25:25,916
<i>The insurance of eight lakh</i>
<i>rupees was just a precursor</i>

1871
02:25:26,750 --> 02:25:28,375
<i>to make Walid believe of my death.</i>

1872
02:25:28,541 --> 02:25:30,541
-Give me a number.
-Number?

1873
02:25:31,083 --> 02:25:32,083
Eight.

1874
02:25:38,625 --> 02:25:42,625
<i>The distance between the</i>
<i>three million US dollars and me is</i>

1875
02:25:43,750 --> 02:25:46,791
<i>is as much as the sea and this ship.</i>

1876
02:25:49,125 --> 02:25:51,375
<i>Kurup's character can now come to an end.</i>

1877
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,666
<i>The future belongs to Alexander.</i>

1878
02:25:56,708 --> 02:25:58,708
<i>Charlie had to sacrifice his life for it.</i>

1879
02:26:00,458 --> 02:26:01,458
<i>But in my world…</i>

1880
02:26:02,375 --> 02:26:04,166
<i>if someone matters to me…</i>

1881
02:26:05,125 --> 02:26:06,291
<i>then that's myself.</i>

1882
02:26:09,041 --> 02:26:10,375
Alexander!

1883
02:26:21,041 --> 02:26:23,750
<i>Sudhakara Kurup should remain a fugitive.</i>

1884
02:26:24,541 --> 02:26:26,166
<i>The punishment that</i>
<i>he is worthy of…</i>

1885
02:26:26,250 --> 02:26:28,083
<i>isn't yet written down</i>
<i>in our legal system.</i>

1886
02:26:28,458 --> 02:26:29,833
<i>He deserves a sentence…</i>

1887
02:26:30,125 --> 02:26:31,916
<i>that is greater than all the judgments.</i>

1888
02:26:35,083 --> 02:26:37,791
-Hello, captain speaking.
-Can I speak to Walid?

1889
02:26:43,041 --> 02:26:45,250
It's very sad that you
haven't had him yet.

1890
02:26:47,875 --> 02:26:49,625
I guess we are looking
for the same person.

1891
02:26:50,666 --> 02:26:54,083
I will now make sure he
suffers every inch to death.

1892
02:27:01,250 --> 02:27:02,458
-Yeah.
-Walid.

1893
02:27:03,541 --> 02:27:06,250
The rat you are looking
for is on your ship.

1894
02:27:07,125 --> 02:27:09,750
-He will need help.
-Okay, thank you.

1895
02:27:10,166 --> 02:27:11,416
I'll take good care of him.

1896
02:27:13,083 --> 02:27:13,958
Alexander!

1897
02:27:29,708 --> 02:27:31,916
Sudhakara Kurup will remain a fugitive.

1898
02:27:32,583 --> 02:27:33,708
If some day…

1899
02:27:34,541 --> 02:27:37,041
Charlie's son wants to
avenge his father's death

1900
02:27:37,833 --> 02:27:38,875
tell him that

1901
02:27:39,791 --> 02:27:42,875
a police officer did
that a long time ago.

1902
02:28:39,750 --> 02:28:42,000
Sir, you forgot this.

1903
02:30:19,083 --> 02:30:20,416
WHERE IS KURUP?

1904
02:30:22,625 --> 02:30:23,708
DOPPELGANGER IN HARIDWAR
WHERE IS KURUP?

1905
02:30:23,791 --> 02:30:26,916
<i>Police leave for Las Vegas</i>
<i>to look for Kurup.</i>

1906
02:30:27,125 --> 02:30:29,916
<i>It is related to a murder that</i>
<i>happened in 1948.</i>

1907
02:30:38,458 --> 02:30:40,625
<i>Gabriel, we have spotted Alexander.</i>

1908
02:30:40,750 --> 02:30:42,916
<i>He is coming out on the</i>
<i>streets with two bodyguards.</i>

1909
02:30:43,041 --> 02:30:43,875
<i>Do you see him?</i>

1910
02:30:43,958 --> 02:30:45,666
<i>Can you see him, Gabriel? Over.</i>

1911
02:30:46,875 --> 02:30:48,166
I got him, over.

1912
02:31:01,333 --> 02:31:03,375
Take as many pictures as possible.

1913
02:31:03,750 --> 02:31:05,666
Take close-ups as well. Over!

1914
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:06,958
Yeah.

1915
02:31:19,583 --> 02:31:21,041
<i>Gabriel, can you hear me?</i>

1916
02:31:21,500 --> 02:31:23,500
<i>Gabriel, can you please respond?</i>
