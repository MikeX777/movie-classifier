like this,

I remember the last time
I saw his face.

951
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:16,158
He was holding
a possessed girl
in his clutches,

952
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,461
not wanting
to turn her over
to the order.

953

Why didn't he want
to give her up?

954
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:25,501
Your father had the ability
to see the good in everyone.

955
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:27,536
And on that day...

956
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:32,508
...he saw the good
in Laurel.

957
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:40,215
Father Tollman had never seen
anyone recover from
such a strong possession,

958
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:43,619
and he deemed it necessary
to terminate the child.

959
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,322

felt otherwise.
