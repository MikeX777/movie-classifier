1
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,249
It's Father Giulio with the holy oil.

2
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:50,124
Tell him to wait,
I've had it twice already.

3
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,916
What am I?

4
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,215
- A Chinese.
- And now?

5
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,656
- A sad Chinese.
- I dreamt of someone like that...

6
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,557
...who brought me a telegram.

7
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,754
I was too scared to open it,

8
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,231
then I opened it
but nothing was written inside.

9
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,202
I want to be alone.

10
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,373
And all those people waiting outside?

11
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:48,876
They can come in later,
they can all come in later...

12
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,501
Feel the tension in your hair.

13
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,635
Relax.

14
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,804
He talked about this simile:

15
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:37,452
A man had a fig tree
planted in his vineyard.

16
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:45,561
He went to look for fruit,
but didn't find any.

17
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,898
Force the tension
into the bottom of your eyes,

18
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,495
force the tension
into the bottom of your ears,

19
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,903
force the tension
down into the nape of the neck,

20
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,909
feel the difference between
a relaxed head...

21
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:01,071
and the tension you had in your eyes,

22
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:04,311
in your ears and
in the nape of your neck.

23
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:12,588
So the man said to the vine-dresser
who was with him:

24
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:19,560
"I've been coming here for three years

25
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:27,000
to harvest the fruit of this fig,

26
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,701
there's never any fruit.

27
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,678
See to it that it's cut down.

28
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:40,109
Why should it occupy the land?"

29
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:47,088
Let the tension leave
through your scalp,

30
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:52,688
the nerves and blood
under the scalp.

31
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,927
And he replies:

32
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:03,902
"Master, let it live this year.

33
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:09,076
I'll hoe the ground all around it,

34
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,205
and I'll use manure as fertilizer,

35
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:16,018
and if it then produces fruit, good.

36
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:19,990
If not, we'll cut it down."

37
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,474
- Have you got a light please?
- Yeah, sure.

38
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,907
Here...

39
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,608
Thanks.

40
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:23,752
- What are these holes for?
- To get by...

41
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,947
- What a nice smell!
- I'm meeting my girlfriend.

42
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:54,747
Oh, that's why.
Good idea... and the flowers?

43
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,550
My girlfriend is bringing them to me...

44
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,991
How come you're working
when you're so old?

45
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,326
You want me
to come to eat at your place?

46
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,730
Talking of which,
I'm hungry granddad.

47
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:45,360
It seems like only yesterday
that I was like you.

48
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,951
Riccetto, Riccetto listen to me...

49
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:51,928
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

50
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:56,422
Listen, Riccetto,
this is God talking, God, God!

51
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,861
Don't you understand Riccetto,
God's talking to you.

52
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,929
Will you listen to me now?

53
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,636
No.

54
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,641
But I'm speaking simply...

55
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,007
Give me a sign, just one sign,

56
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,539
and I'll understand
that you want to listen to me.

57
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:17,520
Can't you hear me? Are you deaf?
Don't you have ears?

58
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:26,022
- Hey, let me get in.
- Alright, be careful, get in.

59
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,892
- Are you working?
- Yes, you have to...

60
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,402
I don't know...
I don't know about these things.

61
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:37,874
You're right,
but I've got a wife and son.

62
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,308
He was born three days ago,
did you know?

63
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,107
I'll talk to you anyway, Riccetto,

64
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,876
even if you don't want
to give me a sign.

65
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,008
Anyway your son
drinks his mother's milk...

66
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,882
But you've got to work anyway...

67
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:52,582
Bloody hell,
I haven't got a job, damn it!

68
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,185
The nice thing
about work's the satisfaction.

69
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,387
- Yeah, sure...
- At 5 past 5 there's nothing as nice...

70
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:02,195
...as finishing work.
- I'm off at 8!

71
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:27,188
[In French]
Gimme a kiss... gimme a kiss...

72
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,150
[in French]
Another one... another one...

73
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,860
You're happy, aren't you?

74
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,965
This is what I want from you...

75
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:42,460
From you I want your fruits,
your first fruits.

76
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,965
What are these fruits?

77
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,974
The fruits of your knowledge
and your will...

78
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:52,277
What do you know, Riccetto?
What do you want, Riccetto?

79
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,508
- Hello, Mr. Street-cleaner.
- Hey, Riccetto...

80
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:56,348
They told me you were dying,
is it true?

81
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,047
What are you saying, kid?

82
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,817
I've still got lots of
sweeping to do...

83
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,552
I've got to sweep
the whole of Via Nazionale.

84
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,355
You're innocent, it's true.

85
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:05,293
And those who are innocent
have no knowledge.

86
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,354
And those who have no knowledge
have no will.

87
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:11,595
But I who am your God,
order you to know and to want.

88
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:34,486
I know it's a contradiction,
perhaps without a solution,

89
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:38,325
because if you are an innocent,
you cannot be otherwise.

90
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:39,556
And if you are innocent,

91
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,689
you cannot have conscience and will.

92
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:44,530
Tell me, to whom did Christ,
my son,

93
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:46,661
spoke, if not to the innocents?

94
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:49,365
And why?
Because he wanted them to know.

95
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:52,000
...you, like the fig tree,
might say it's too early,

96
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:54,006
that it's only March,

97
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,103
that you can't give of your fruits,

98
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,545
that you'll give them in September.

99
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:01,813
Nonsense...
'March', 'September'...

100
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:05,253
For me, God,
they are nothing but empty words.

101
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,581
If faith can move mountains,
just think

102
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:11,526
how unimportant it is
if it's March or September...

103
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:14,030
Listen to me, Riccetto, listen to me.

104
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:16,089
I'd be satisfied with a nod of your head

105
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,760
or a glance towards the sky.

106
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:20,395
Listen to me if you don't want
to lose yourself.

107
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:28,903
Innocence is a fault,
innocence is a fault, understand?

108
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,244
The innocents will be condemned

109
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,511
because they will no longer have
the right to be innocent.

110
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:37,987
I cannot pardon those who go
through injustice and wars,

111
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:42,890
through horrors and blood,
with the happy air of innocents.

112
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:46,085
There are millions of innocents
like you in the world

113
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:48,427
who would rather disappear from history

114
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:51,491
than lose their innocence.

115
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,570
And I have to make them die...

116
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:57,297
Even though I know
they have no choice...

117
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,172
I have to damn them
like the fig tree,

118
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:04,203
...and make them die, die, die.
- What?

119
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:15,082
There's no time without time.

120
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,686
And I've been waiting
a long time for you.

121
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,794
Time has all the time.

122
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,104
They loved each other, and time

123
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,405
didn't change their love at all.

124
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:51,751
The old time fairy tales
enter his life today...

125
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:02,397
Because...
there's no time without time.

126
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:08,598
I've been waiting
a long time for you.

127
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:19,347
Time has all the...

128
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:23,080
MADE IN CUBA

129
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,585
[in French]
What's that?

130
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,127
I don't know what it is.

131
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:35,522
[In French]
You don't know what that is?

132
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:42,129
Perhaps they were
the first images of a film.

133
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:44,569
[In French]
The first images of a film...

134
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,732
[in French]
Oh, yeah, maybe...

135
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,578
But I don't know which film.

136
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,578
[In French]
What kind of film?

137
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,874
Maybe it's an Evgeniy Onegin film.

138
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:02,316
[In French]
Maybe it's an Albert Norisseau film.

139
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:06,028
Or maybe, it's a J.L. Godard film.

140
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:12,729
[In French]
Maybe it's a Christian Dior film.

141
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:18,030
In any case it's in
Techniscope and Eastmancolor.

142
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:21,335
[In French]
Yeah, it's in 'scope', and in color.

143
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,175
[In French]
Are there any actors?

144
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,306
Yes, there are actors...

145
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,248
[in French]
And who are they?

146
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:31,951
Nino Castelnuovo and Christine Guého.

147
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:35,184
[In French]
And what role do they play?

148
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:39,823
He's Italian and she's French.

149
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:42,525
[In French]
The French girl leaves her family for him?

150
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:45,831
Yes, and he also leaves
his family for her...

151
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,328
[in French]
And he leaves his family for her.

152
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:49,804
Yes, they love each other,

153
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,503
so they do
the same thing for each other.

154
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,509
[In French]
Good, they want to marry

155
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:58,480
because they love each other.

156
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,646
Yes, they want to get married.

157
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:03,847
[In French]
And what about us?

158
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,718
We'll wait and see.

159
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,592
[In French]
We'll wait for what?

160
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:13,686
Because we've got to be
the witnesses at their wedding.

161
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,788
[In French]
We are the witnesses.

162
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,960
[In French]
What's the title of this film?

163
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,428
I've forgotten the title...

164
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:24,102
...it's something about "Children".

165
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,537
[In French]
"The Children"?

166
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,010
"Les enfants terribles".
["The terrible children"]

167
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:36,780
No... not 'terrible'.

168
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:41,690
[In French]
The humiliated children.

169
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:44,660
No, not humiliated' either.

170
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,759
[In French]
It's crazy that you forgot the title.

171
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,298
Yes, it's a shame...

172
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:53,129
They told me,
but I don't remember it anymore.

173
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:56,302
[In French]
Didn't they give you a script?

174
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,273
There isn't any script.

175
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:03,736
[In French]
So, how do you know what's going on?

176
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:08,012
To know what's going on
you just have to watch.

177
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,556
If we're witnesses,
we're observers too.

178
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:19,555
[In French]
Yes, it's true...

179
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,324
[in French]
...to be a witness is to be an observer.

180
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,430
[In French]
We must watch.

181
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,004
Let's watch.

182
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,079
[In French]
When... the world...

183
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:45,851
[in French]
Will be... will be reduced...

184
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:48,720
[in French]
To a black forest...

185
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:51,386
The world is reduced to a black forest.

186
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:54,453
[In French]
For four astonished eyes...

187
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:56,226
Four astonished eyes.

188
00:53:56,266 --> 00:54:01,226
[In French]
A beach for a faithful couple.

189
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:03,205
A beach for a faithful couple.

190
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,639
[In French]
We'll meet again.

191
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:06,301
We'll meet again.

192
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:09,176
The war that China will wage...

193
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:12,477
[in French]
Yes. The war that China will wage...

194
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:14,841
...against the rest of humanity...

195
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:17,045
[in French]
...against the rest of humanity...

196
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:21,950
...will be a bridge to a new age
in the history of humanity.

197
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,084
[In French]
...will be a bridge to a new age

198
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,117
in the history of humanity.

199
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:28,829
[In French]
Listen... it's here and now...

200
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,833
that our voyages start and end.

201
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:35,270
It's here and now
that our journeys start and end.

202
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,866
[In French]
It's here that we'll defend our lives...

203
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,600
It's here that we'll defend our lives...

204
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:44,244
[in French]
...and look for the world.

205
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,845
...and look for the world.

206
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:51,286
Yes, this summer is violent.

207
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:52,548
[In French]
It's an hot summer.

208
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:53,749
All the world's peoples are revolting

209
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,189
against the exploiters.

210
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,715
[In French]
All the world's peoples are revolting...

211
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,125
In Aden, South Yemen,

212
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:01,221
the revolutionary forces
are increasing the pressure.

213
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,259
Yeah, sure...
Yeah...

214
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,865
[in French]
Quiet and nude...

215
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:09,667
Quiet and nude...

216
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,234
[in French]
We pass among our peers...

217
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,436
We pass among our peers...

218
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,967
[in French]
Without losing ourselves.

219
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:18,003
Without losing ourselves.

220
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,919
In Bolivia, in Venezuela,
the guerrillas checkmate...

221
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:27,317
they checkmate
the powerful repressive forces

222
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:30,419
organized by American technicians.

223
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:36,992
We must be actively
and solidly behind their struggle.

224
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:39,001
[In French]
We must be actively and solidly

225
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:40,662
behind their struggle.

226
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:48,539
[In French]
Plains, snow-covered roofs,

227
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,442
the luxuriant tropics.

228
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:54,677
Plains, snow-covered roofs,
the luxuriant tropics.

229
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:57,148
[In French]
The sky that changes.

230
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,121
The sky that changes.

231
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,953
[In French]
A single couple united by a single garment.

232
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:05,961
A single couple, a single garment.

233
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:07,428
[In French]
By the same desire.

234
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:09,125
The same desire.

235
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,759
[In French]
Laid down at the feet of their own image.

236
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:14,167
Laid down at the feet of their own image.

237
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,069
[In French]
An infinite couple.

238
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,937
An infinite couple.

239
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,439
There is no other way

240
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:24,277
that will lead us to the radiant society
heralded by Marx...

241
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:32,318
...when he said it would offer everyone...

242
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:37,155
...bread and roses.

243
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,359
Socialism.

244
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:44,961
MADE IN CUBA

245
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,992
[in French]
All I want... is to love you.

246
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:50,932
All I want... is to love you.

247
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:53,533
[In French]
To look in your eyes and see only...

248
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:57,971
To look in your eyes
and see only...

249
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:00,973
[in French]
...what I think of you.

250
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,615
...what I think of you.

251
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:05,848
[In French]
The days and nights

252
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,481
are measured by your eyelids.

253
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:12,085
The days and nights
are measured by your eyelids.

254
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:14,358
[In French]
Or to laugh together on the streets.

255
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:18,629
Or... to laugh together on the streets.

256
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,100
[In French]
What time is the marriage?

257
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:32,478
The wedding? At 11.

258
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:35,150
[In French]
I'm sure they will be late...

259
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,719
Why should they be late?

260
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:41,585
[In French]
The couple is embracing.

261
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:44,092
It's normal that they embrace.

262
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,686
[In French]
Did you understand what they said?

263
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:50,689
No, I haven't heard what they said.

264
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,496
What did they say?

265
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:56,229
[In French]
Eternity started and will end in a bed.

266
00:57:57,373 --> 00:58:01,901
Eternity...
started and will end in a bed.

267
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,037
Did they say that?

268
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,013
[In French]
Yes, yes, that's what they said.

269
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:09,914
The film might last an eternity,
if they said that...

270
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,477
[in French]
So, this film will last an eternity?

271
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:17,254
[In French]
I hope they will argue and break up...

272
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:21,154
Should they argue and break up?
Why?

273
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,861
[In French]
That way, the film will end quickly...

274
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,425
Yes, obviously.

275
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:30,002
That way the film will finish early,

276
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:32,774
and there won't be a wedding.

277
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,839
[In French]
No, there won't be a wedding.

278
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:38,714
[In French]
In fact, I'm amazed by this wedding...

279
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,680
[in French]
They will break up...

280
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:44,553
Why are you amazed
about the wedding?

281
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,784
I don't think they'll separate.

282
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:52,561
At the end of the day
they're not Tito and Berenice.

283
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:55,155
[In French]
Yes, right, they're not Tito and Berenice.

284
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:58,065
[In French]
They're neither Arabs, nor Jewish.

285
00:58:58,101 --> 00:58:59,762
[In French]
They will surely break up...

286
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:05,203
No... his father was of Arabian origin,
but not him.

287
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:11,845
And her mother was completely Jewish,
but she isn't.

288
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:14,143
They won't separate.

289
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:15,673
[In French]
Wanna bet?

290
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,811
Alright... let's bet on it.

291
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,719
[In French]
Ok, let's watch.

292
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:22,691
Alright, let's watch.

293
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,360
[In French]
It's a way of saying the opposite.

294
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,894
Yes, I said the opposite, so what?

295
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:37,600
[In French]
So they were just lies...

296
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,074
No, they were not lies.

297
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:42,270
[In French]
But it wasn't the truth...

298
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:47,145
Yes... it was already
a part of the truth.

299
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,476
[In French]
Oh, yeah...

300
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,318
[in French]
So, it's the truth born of contradictions?

301
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:55,518
Exactly.

302
00:59:55,992 --> 01:00:00,486
The truth is born of the justification
of the contradictions

303
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,158
in the hearts of the people.

304
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:12,270
[In French]
It's the solution of people's contradictions.

305
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:15,709
Yes...
that's where you find the truth.

306
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:17,610
[In French]
So it's alright for us?

307
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:19,410
I'm afraid not.

308
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,114
Everything's going wrong for us.

309
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:24,176
[In French]
Why? We're opposite types.

310
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:27,087
[In French]
I'm part of the people, and so are you...

311
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:33,893
Because between us there's no contrast,
just antagonism.

312
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:39,601
[In French]
We're antagonists, and not opposites?

313
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:44,939
You aren't the people,
you're the middle class.

314
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:50,105
[In French]
Yes, I'm not the people, I'm the middle class.

315
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:56,550
I'd like to stay with you...
but I'd like to leave you.

316
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:59,646
[In French]
Yes, stay with me, I don't want to leave you.

317
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,953
Yes, but you see,
we've already separated,

318
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,152
you're not a revolutionary.

319
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,818
[In French]
It's true, I'm not a revolutionary.

320
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,526
[In French]
And we've already separated.

321
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:11,897
[In French]
When are you leaving?

322
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:13,663
Soon.

323
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:17,365
I'm catching a plane for Mexico City at 5.

324
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:20,399
[In French]
And a plane from Mexico to Cuba?

325
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:25,570
Cuba's surrounded...
you have to go via Mexico.

326
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:28,213
[In French]
I thought there was a direct flight.

327
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:30,685
[In French]
I didn't know Cuba was surrounded.

328
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:10,422
The old time fairy tales
enter his life today.

329
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:20,934
Because there's no time without time.

330
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,965
And I've been waiting
a long time for you.

331
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,879
Time has all the time.

332
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:45,822
Your hand comes towards me...

333
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,962
The love of these moments

334
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:02,069
You know you only live once.

335
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:09,111
Because...
there's no time without time.

336
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:15,713
And I've been waiting
a long time for you.

337
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,833
Time has all the time.

338
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:29,701
Time.

339
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,171
Time.

340
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,107
So, what are you doing?

341
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,307
[In French]
Yes, what are you doing?

342
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,077
Can't you see we're talking?

343
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:44,177
[In French]
What are they talking about?

344
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:49,289
Considering the images, probably love.

345
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:52,691
[In French]
But sometimes, images lie.

346
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:56,789
No, images never lie.

347
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:02,070
[In French]
Yes, images often lie.

348
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:04,629
[In French]
In fact, cinema is a world of lies...

349
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,471
[in French]
Why are you laughing?

350
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:09,236
I've got the right to laugh.

351
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:11,143
[In French]
Yes, but why?

352
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:14,049
I'm laughing because of what you said...

353
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:18,386
that cinema is the art of lying.

354
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:20,685
[In French]
So, why is that funny?

355
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,557
Why's that funny?

356
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:27,095
Because you're of a certain age...

357
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:30,297
but you're speaking about something
that's very young.

358
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:33,200
[In French]
I'm not that old, I'm just 20.

359
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:35,429
[In French]
But Cinema is not so young...

360
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:38,964
[in French]
It has the age of Roosevelt, Churchill...

361
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,134
[in French]
...Stalin after the war...

362
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:45,203
Yes... Cinema has
the same age as Stalin,

363
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:50,242
Churchill and Roosevelt,
but they were old...

364
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:56,086
...and that's why everything's
going wrong today.

365
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:59,525
[In French]
Is everything wrong 'cause they were old?

366
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:02,354
[In French]
Why?

367
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:07,201
Because they were old people
who lead a new world

368
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,636
without knowing it was new.

369
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,297
[In French]
Oh, yes, I see.

370
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,070
[In French]
Like Kosygin, de Gaulle or Johnson today.

371
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,270
[In French]
Old men who don't know

372
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:17,142
[in French]
They're leading a new world.

373
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:25,382
Yes, like Kosygin,
de Gaulle or Johnson today.

374
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:29,518
[In French]
Yeah, alright, but...

375
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:32,186
[in French]
What's the relationship between cinema and me?

376
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:36,465
What's the relationship
between you and cinema?

377
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:41,260
It's that you talk about
something you don't know.

378
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:43,796
[In French]
I talk about things I don't know?

379
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,364
[In French]
It's not true, I go to the cinema very often.

380
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:49,409
Perhaps you often go to the cinema,

381
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,077
but you see very few films...

382
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:53,706
or, on the contrary,

383
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:58,948
you see lots of films,
but you see little Cinema.

384
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:01,122
[In French]
How can you say I see little cinema...

385
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:03,125
if I watch lots of films...

386
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:09,527
Because Cinema doesn't exist yet,
or films either.

387
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:12,133
[In French]
Cinema doesn't exist yet?

388
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:14,836
[In French]
So it's like mathematics before Euclides...

389
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,735
[in French]
And before Einstein...

390
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:19,832
[in French]
It's a stuttering... it's clumsy.

391
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:25,705
It's like mathematics
before Euclides and Einstein,

392
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:31,648
it's a stuttering, clumsy science.

393
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:34,622
[In French]
And the things we see, what are they?

394
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,885
Nothing.

395
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:37,859
[In French]
Really nothing?

396
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,224
Sometimes...

397
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:47,525
in an old Murnau film,
or... a young Bertolucci film...

398
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:50,431
you see something happening.

399
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:52,665
[In French]
Yes, it's true...

400
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:55,302
[in French]
Sometimes in a young Dreyer film...

401
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,437
[in French]
Or in an old Rouche film...

402
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,675
[in French]
You can see something different...

403
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:03,947
[in French]
Like a flash... that is the truth of Cinema.

404
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:08,551
Like a bolt of lightning,
that represents the truth of cinema.

405
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,889
[In French]
Let's watch.

406
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:14,262
Yes... let's watch.

407
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,092
[In French]
Down there, the withered flowers

408
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,128
of other people's holidays.

409
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:28,633
Down there, the withered flowers
of other people's holidays.

410
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:31,271
[In French]
Even when we are...

411
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:34,008
[in French]
Far from one another...

412
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:37,075
Even when we're separated...

413
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,022
[in French]
...everything brings us together.

414
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:41,852
...everything brings us together.

415
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,792
[In French]
The prisons of freedom are falling.

416
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:48,392
The prisons of freedom are falling.

417
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:51,261
[In French]
A hint of the view was enough.

418
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:55,535
A fragment of a view was enough.

419
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:58,802
[In French]
The sun's eyelid falls on your face.

420
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:03,842
The sun's eyelid covers your face.

421
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:09,146
[In French]
Our unmovable weight digs our path.

422
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:12,716
Our unmovable weight digs our path.

423
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,188
[In French]
A womans nudity is wiser

424
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,453
[in French]
Than a philosopher's teachings.

425
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:23,426
A woman's nudity is wiser
than a philosopher's teachings.

426
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:27,802
[In French]
Is it your hand, a dazzling souvenir in the sun?

427
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:31,273
Is it my hand, this dazzling souvenir
in the sun?

428
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,336
[In French]
That sacrifices time

429
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,434
[in French]
To the eternal youth of the perfect flame.

430
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:39,608
Yes, I sacrifice time
to the eternal youth of the perfect flame.

431
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:44,480
[In French]
Poor is your hand, to be so indifferent

432
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:48,354
How poor your hand is,
to be so indifferent...

433
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:50,584
[in French]
To the twilight, who let everything go.

434
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:54,062
To the twilight, who let everything go.

435
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:55,222
[In French]
Your hand, that will never be able

436
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:57,323
[in French]
To distance me from you.

437
01:08:57,433 --> 01:09:01,267
Your hand, that will never be able
to distance me from you.

438
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:03,336
I am the mirror...

439
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:05,101
[in French]
I think about what they said...

440
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,609
...so I am the observer,

441
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,338
[in French]
I am a witness...

442
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:12,006
So I am the image.

443
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:13,776
[In French]
And I say what they think...

444
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:17,411
And I say what they think...

445
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:19,387
[in French]
So I am the observer.

446
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:21,286
I am the witness.

447
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,950
[In French]
I am the mirror.

448
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,620
I think about what they said.

449
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,288
[In French]
So I am the reflection.

450
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:32,767
If existence is not free,
it becomes empty, or neutral.

451
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:37,929
If it's free, it's nothing but a game.

452
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:42,711
[In French]
There's a tragic reality... Vietnam.

453
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:46,007
[In French]
This country who embodies the ambitions

454
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:48,812
[in French]
And the hopes of a forgotten world...

455
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,876
[in French]
...tragically alone.

456
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:59,786
The earth...
until it gave birth to just trees or birds,

457
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:02,757
was a free universe.

458
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:05,665
[In French]
If we analyze Vietnam's loneliness,

459
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,333
[in French]
We fall into distress

460
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,896
[in French]
Because of this illogic moment of mankind.

461
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:14,409
The charm of freedom...

462
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:19,177
lost its splendor...

463
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:21,750
when the earth...

464
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:24,876
produced for the first time...

465
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,185
a being who demanded...

466
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:36,092
freedom as if it were
a law set above the universe.

467
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:39,760
[In French]
If it's not free, existence becomes empty.

468
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:41,931
[In French]
Or neutral.

469
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,405
[In French]
If it's free, it's a game.

470
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:51,744
There is a tragic situation... Vietnam.

471
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:55,483
A nation that embodies...

472
01:10:56,785 --> 01:11:02,155
the aspirations and hopes for victory...

473
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,093
of a whole forgotten world.

474
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:11,031
Vietnam is tragically alone.

475
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:12,724
[In French]
The earth... until it gave birth

476
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,793
[in French]
To just trees or birds,

477
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,138
[in French]
Was a free universe.

478
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:21,233
If we analyze Vietnam's loneliness,

479
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:26,441
we fall into distress
because of this illogic moment...

480
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,184
that mankind is going through.

481
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:31,118
[In French]
The charm of freedom lost its splendor

482
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:32,620
when the earth produced for the first time

483
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:34,054
a being who demanded freedom

484
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:36,353
as if it were a law
set above the universe.

485
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:38,417
Beyond what I am...

486
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,893
[in French]
We have long believed that...

487
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:41,759
Which fills me with anxiety.

488
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,992
[In French]
...America will be the theatre of great wars...

489
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:45,591
I meet a being...

490
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:46,794
[in French]
...fought by all humanity.

491
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:50,703
And to live only for what fascinates us.

492
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:51,933
[In French]
The struggle in America...

493
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,965
[in French]
Will happen when the time is right,

494
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:55,203
[in French]
Because it's a question of innocence

495
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:57,235
[in French]
Of size of the continent

496
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:59,247
[in French]
And of crimes committed for its liberation.

497
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:00,976
You have to refuse boredom.

498
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:02,210
[In French]
Beyond what I am...

499
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:06,278
We...
have long believed that...

500
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,755
[in French]
Which fills me with anxiety.

501
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:13,228
...America will be the theatre...

502
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,056
...of great wars...

503
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:20,034
[in French]
I meet a being...

504
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:23,038
...fought... by all humanity.

505
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:25,063
[In French]
...and to live only for what fascinates us.

506
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:28,599
The struggle in America...

507
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:34,908
will happen when the time is right,
because...

508
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,808
it's a question of innocence...

509
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,945
of size of the continent...

510
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:41,387
and of crimes committed for its liberation.

511
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:44,324
[In French]
You have to refuse boredom.

512
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:47,260
Because the enemy is there,
always present.

513
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:52,061
The enemy strikes every day,

514
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:57,395
and threatens us
with new attacks every day.

515
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:02,739
These attacks will unite us today,

516
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:05,679
tomorrow, the day after tomorrow...

517
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,181
[in French]
Because the enemy is there,

518
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,410
[in French]
He strikes every day,

519
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,509
[in French]
And threatens us with new attacks.

520
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:12,281
[In French]
These attacks will unite us today,

521
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:14,221
[in French]
Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow...

522
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:18,955
To be nude means making the effort...

523
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:23,495
to climb beyond the first words

524
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:26,363
in the dark sex of silence.

525
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,596
[In French]
To be nude means making the effort...

526
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:29,695
[in French]
To climb beyond the first words

527
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:32,104
[in French]
In the dark sex of silence.

528
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:37,374
The nude then becomes
the black and white,

529
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,348
it becomes something that

530
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:44,113
is no longer a subject
and has no substance...

531
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:51,088
It is the mortal... silent monster.

532
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:52,388
[In French]
The nude then becomes

533
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,089
[in French]
The black and white...

534
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:55,722
[in French]
It becomes something that

535
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:56,992
[in French]
Is no longer a subject

536
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:58,522
[in French]
And has no substance...

537
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:02,970
[in French]
It is the mortal silent monster.

538
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:07,475
Those who prepare
for this necessary union

539
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:12,638
will be the object
of the people's gratitude.

540
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:20,753
[In French]
Those who prepare for this union

541
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:24,081
[in French]
Will receive the people's gratitude.

542
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:36,135
Without an armed struggle
there is no definite avant garde.

543
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:37,568
[In French]
There is not a definite avant garde...

544
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:38,903
[in French]
Without an armed struggle?

545
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:40,306
[In French]
So what?

546
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:44,369
Today the Marines are shooting
everything that moves.

547
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:46,743
[In French]
The Marines are shooting everything that moves?

548
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:48,010
[In French]
So what?

549
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:50,814
After the Cuban revolution...

550
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:54,286
...after Santo Domingo,
after Greece,

551
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,655
after the Arab-Israeli war,

552
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,624
after the resistance in Hanoi,

553
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:02,189
after the mercenaries in the Congo,

554
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:04,689
there's a state of urgency.

555
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:06,801
[In French]
Is there a state of urgency?

556
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,132
[In French]
So what?

557
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:11,697
So there are urgent,
principled reasons,

558
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:15,369
that entail armed revolutionary
front lines everywhere,

559
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:17,810
which are disowned
by the European left.

560
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:21,876
[In French]
What are these revolutionary front lines?

561
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,713
It's my family...

562
01:15:28,323 --> 01:15:30,348
It's revolution.

563
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:35,728
Your family... is democracy.

564
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:38,699
[In French]
Yes, revolution is your family.

565
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:41,328
[In French]
Democracy is my family. Right.

566
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,065
[In French]
So what?

567
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:47,138
So, these two things
can't live together.

568
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:50,801
[In French]
They can't live together, even if they're alone?

569
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:55,249
No...
not even if they love each other.

570
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:58,950
What are they doing?!

571
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,451
[In French]
They're still, they don't move.

572
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:05,758
If they're not moving,
it means it's the end of the film.

573
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:06,954
[In French]
Is this the end of the film?

574
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:08,622
Yes.

575
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:12,562
[In French]
Did you remember the title?

576
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:15,934
I remember the title now.

577
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:20,708
It's "The Departure and Return
of the Prodigal Children".

578
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:22,869
[In French]
The Departure and Return of the Prodigal Children?

579
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,970
[In French]
What does it mean?

580
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:28,181
[In French]
Sounds like a biblical title.

581
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:30,309
It is a biblical title.

582
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:34,915
It means that each of the prodigal children

583
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:36,857
returns to their own families.

584
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:38,792
[In French]
I was right, they will break up

585
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,488
[in French]
And return to their homes.

586
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:43,498
Let's watch the images
for the last time...

587
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:46,466
[in French]
We're gonna watch the images again?

588
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:49,733
[In French]
We can't, the door is closed...

589
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:52,830
Well, let's listen to the images...

590
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:56,435
[in French]
Yes... let's listen to the images...

591
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,746
[in French]
It was the first and only dream.

592
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,512
The first...

593
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:06,086
...the only dream.

594
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,557
[In French]
Well, goodbye...

595
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:11,821
No goodbyes...

596
01:17:28,579 --> 01:17:32,709
featuring a group of students
from the University of Rome

597
01:17:48,866 --> 01:17:52,768
- How is it?
- Fine!

598
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:56,468
Well now...

599
01:17:57,775 --> 01:18:02,542
'Poetry resembles a sun's ray
that shines on this darkness,

600
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:04,775
covers it with its light

601
01:18:04,815 --> 01:18:09,809
and illuminates
the hidden countenance of things'.

602
01:18:09,854 --> 01:18:14,848
So it's not a work
of empty souls and dull minds.

603
01:18:14,892 --> 01:18:17,292
So artists who,

604
01:18:17,361 --> 01:18:21,491
in the false name of pure art"
or "art for art's sake",

605
01:18:21,532 --> 01:18:23,932
close themselves off
from the commotion of life

606
01:18:23,968 --> 01:18:26,198
and the anxiety of thought...

607
01:18:26,237 --> 01:18:31,834
Ho Chi Minh, cha-cha!

608
01:18:31,876 --> 01:18:36,142
- Get out, you reds!
- Enough, go away!

609
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:41,716
Don't forget your good manners!

610
01:18:41,752 --> 01:18:44,482
Take your hat off and
your hands out of your pockets!

611
01:18:44,522 --> 01:18:46,149
The students' assembly has decided

612
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:48,920
that all of today's didactic activities
must be suspended.

613
01:18:48,959 --> 01:18:51,553
What assembly?
We don't recognize any assembly!

614
01:18:51,595 --> 01:18:54,120
All today's professorial lectures
must be suspended.

615
01:18:54,164 --> 01:18:56,291
After my lecture!

616
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,029
Listen, if you want to talk to me

617
01:18:58,068 --> 01:18:59,262
take your hands out of your pockets...

618
01:18:59,303 --> 01:19:02,272
We don't want to talk to you
but to our comrades!

619
01:19:02,306 --> 01:19:05,434
Listen comrades,
I think the most useful thing now,

620
01:19:05,476 --> 01:19:08,536
especially for those
who weren't part of the assembly,

621
01:19:08,579 --> 01:19:10,171
would be to ask us questions.

622
01:19:10,214 --> 01:19:14,913
We want to listen to the lecture!
It's much more interesting!

623
01:19:14,952 --> 01:19:17,921
- You're desperadoes!
- Hooligans!

624
01:19:17,988 --> 01:19:19,922
We've all got the same problems...

625
01:19:19,957 --> 01:19:22,721
Why don't we talk it over together?

626
01:19:24,995 --> 01:19:29,455
Listen,
this isn't the time or place to talk.

627
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,468
According to the timetable

628
01:19:31,502 --> 01:19:33,800
at this time I've got to give a lesson

629
01:19:33,837 --> 01:19:36,533
and no-one will stop me from doing so.

630
01:19:40,644 --> 01:19:42,942
We don't want
to argue with you, professor...

631
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:45,244
...it would be a waste of time!
- Why?

632
01:19:45,282 --> 01:19:47,944
Do you want to stop me
giving my lesson?

633
01:19:48,185 --> 01:19:51,052
Be honest, have the courage to...

634
01:19:52,389 --> 01:19:54,880
Look, you should change your tone.

635
01:19:54,925 --> 01:19:58,361
Perhaps you don't know
that you're talking to a professor

636
01:19:58,395 --> 01:20:01,558
who's been in a concentration camp
for two years,

637
01:20:01,599 --> 01:20:03,999
I've been in Dachau!

638
01:20:04,034 --> 01:20:09,199
You've been in Dachau,
and now you're talking crap!

639
01:20:10,774 --> 01:20:14,801
Why did you wipe it all off?!
Rewrite everything!

640
01:20:18,816 --> 01:20:20,010
Anyway kids,

641
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:23,213
why don't we talk about
occupying the university

642
01:20:23,253 --> 01:20:24,914
and about academic authoritarianism?

643
01:20:24,955 --> 01:20:27,355
- Get out, go away!
- No!

644
01:20:30,294 --> 01:20:32,421
Is this the only answer you've got?

645
01:20:32,463 --> 01:20:34,522
And I know why, because university

646
01:20:34,565 --> 01:20:38,194
doesn't teach you to be
an individual with ideas...

647
01:20:38,235 --> 01:20:40,829
but just how to repeat,
to repeat by rote.

648
01:20:40,871 --> 01:20:42,532
It teaches you
how to stay in your place,

649
01:20:42,573 --> 01:20:44,473
to respect the hierarchy...

650
01:20:44,508 --> 01:20:47,705
It teaches you how to command,
but not in a real way

651
01:20:47,745 --> 01:20:49,576
because it's about executing commands

652
01:20:49,613 --> 01:20:52,081
like we obey orders today...

653
01:20:55,219 --> 01:20:57,585
...it's not occupying the university,
bivouacking inside it

654
01:20:57,621 --> 01:20:59,851
or scribbling on the walls
that you will resolve anything.

655
01:20:59,890 --> 01:21:01,983
Given the current crisis
in the representative bodies,

656
01:21:02,026 --> 01:21:06,360
the occupation for us constitutes
the only means of rebellion

657
01:21:06,397 --> 01:21:10,959
able to challenge the abuse of power
of the academic body...

658
01:21:11,001 --> 01:21:14,562
Secondly, the occupation
has meant the discovery

659
01:21:14,605 --> 01:21:18,097
of a common way of working,
breaking the solitude,

660
01:21:18,142 --> 01:21:21,373
the division and individualism
which are the best weapons

661
01:21:21,412 --> 01:21:24,677
of those who wish to keep us
in a passive state.

662
01:21:24,715 --> 01:21:27,183
The university organizes consensus

663
01:21:27,217 --> 01:21:29,811
with the system
whereas we want to organize dissent.

664
01:21:29,853 --> 01:21:32,378
So the occupation
has constituted an effective tool

665
01:21:32,423 --> 01:21:35,017
for all the student movement...

666
01:21:35,059 --> 01:21:38,790
...and for each one of us
was a time of individual growth.

667
01:21:38,829 --> 01:21:41,525
- Leave alone the university!
- Look at that ignorant!

668
01:21:41,565 --> 01:21:45,558
Don't you understand that
while we continue to live

669
01:21:45,602 --> 01:21:50,039
in the professors' pockets
our dissent is impossible...

670
01:21:53,711 --> 01:21:55,542
Stand up!

671
01:21:56,213 --> 01:21:58,272
Hail the "Duce"!

672
01:21:58,882 --> 01:22:02,613
- Buffoons!
- Ruffians!

673
01:22:02,653 --> 01:22:04,951
As the President of this faculty,
I have to say...

674
01:22:04,988 --> 01:22:06,956
that this is lesson time,

675
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:10,050
so you are obstructing
the execution of a right.

676
01:22:12,062 --> 01:22:15,429
Whether you like it or not,
we're in a democratic country

677
01:22:15,466 --> 01:22:18,731
where there's a parliament
that legislates in harmony

678
01:22:18,769 --> 01:22:23,672
with a constitution that sanctions
equality for all its citizens.

679
01:22:23,707 --> 01:22:26,369
The state is the totality
of the institutions...

680
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:29,038
...destined to defend the interests
of the rich...

681
01:22:29,079 --> 01:22:30,205
against those of the poor,

682
01:22:30,247 --> 01:22:33,216
maintaining the exploitation
of the workforce.

683
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:36,686
The law is always enacted by the rich
against the poor...

684
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,280
...and is administered by magistrates

685
01:22:39,323 --> 01:22:43,020
recruited from the ruling class,
who apply it...

686
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:44,994
with precise class-consciousness.

687
01:22:45,028 --> 01:22:47,963
This coercion is the systematic exercise

688
01:22:47,998 --> 01:22:50,865
of legalized violence
against the exploited.

689
01:22:51,168 --> 01:22:54,899
In every country,
the workers' movements

690
01:22:54,938 --> 01:22:57,168
have had to conquer
the right to be recognized

691
01:22:57,207 --> 01:22:59,038
and to strike through battles...

692
01:22:59,076 --> 01:23:02,409
How dare you insult the professor,
you piece of shit!

693
01:23:02,446 --> 01:23:04,539
...in the conflicts between
capital and work...

694
01:23:04,581 --> 01:23:08,210
the army never intervened
against capital

695
01:23:08,252 --> 01:23:10,049
and always against work...

696
01:23:10,087 --> 01:23:14,387
...to respect this legality means
letting them deceive you.

697
01:23:14,424 --> 01:23:18,258
Think about what you're all doing
before it's too late.

698
01:23:18,295 --> 01:23:20,786
What you're doing is illegal and
I have the duty to tell you that.

699
01:23:20,831 --> 01:23:23,026
We know what we're doing's illegal,

700
01:23:23,066 --> 01:23:26,160
if it was legal
it wouldn't change anything.

701
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:31,304
That's enough.

702
01:23:31,341 --> 01:23:34,105
I also believe
the university needs some reform,

703
01:23:34,144 --> 01:23:37,511
but I don't think a lot's
needed to make it work well...

704
01:23:37,548 --> 01:23:40,847
more rooms,
the right teaching staff...

705
01:23:42,619 --> 01:23:47,215
No to the masters' schools!
No to the masters' schools!

706
01:23:48,192 --> 01:23:51,719
If you stop this agitation,
I'm ready to negotiate with you all

707
01:23:51,762 --> 01:23:55,721
and to organize a schedule of meetings
with the professors...

708
01:23:55,799 --> 01:23:57,824
The problem needs to be faced globally

709
01:23:57,868 --> 01:24:00,428
without stopping this agitation!

710
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:02,836
You're like a slippery eel!

711
01:24:02,873 --> 01:24:05,341
I'm neither an eel nor a buffoon.

712
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:09,744
You're buffoons because
you don't know what you want.

713
01:24:10,047 --> 01:24:14,507
Mr. President, I continue to insist
on doing the lesson!

714
01:24:14,551 --> 01:24:17,145
Afterwards I can talk until midnight

715
01:24:17,187 --> 01:24:19,917
standing on my feet here in front of you...

716
01:24:19,957 --> 01:24:24,360
the Germans also kept me
standing up for hours.

717
01:24:27,798 --> 01:24:31,427
I declare, Mr. President,
that I was violently stopped

718
01:24:31,468 --> 01:24:35,063
from giving my lesson,
which was a crime to which

719
01:24:35,105 --> 01:24:37,198
you are all witnesses!

720
01:24:39,209 --> 01:24:42,269
Like the North Vietnamese
are ready to negotiate

721
01:24:42,312 --> 01:24:44,678
as long as the Americans
stop the bombing,

722
01:24:44,715 --> 01:24:47,206
we professors are ready to negotiate

723
01:24:47,251 --> 01:24:50,152
as long as you stop this agitation.

724
01:24:50,287 --> 01:24:53,347
You are the B-52's
who bomb our brains...

725
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:55,824
...with your stupid stories!

726
01:24:56,326 --> 01:24:59,386
I don't give way to violence,
Mr. President!

727
01:25:01,498 --> 01:25:06,265
You don't need reforms,
you need a reformatory!

728
01:25:09,706 --> 01:25:12,903
Violence has never given good results.

729
01:25:12,943 --> 01:25:16,504
Remember Victor Hugo,
"There's nothing as stupid as winning...

730
01:25:16,546 --> 01:25:18,741
The real glory is in convincing".

731
01:25:18,782 --> 01:25:21,512
You have all my understanding,
believe me kids,

732
01:25:21,551 --> 01:25:23,542
but I can't place myself
outside the law.

733
01:25:23,587 --> 01:25:25,646
- Slave!
- Who said "slave"?!

734
01:25:25,689 --> 01:25:29,420
Slave! Slave! Slave!

735
01:25:29,559 --> 01:25:34,394
Mr. President, just give me the order
and I'll sweep this trash!

736
01:25:35,899 --> 01:25:38,766
Listen Mr. President,
since primary school

737
01:25:38,802 --> 01:25:42,329
they told us to shut up
and obey with no arguments.

738
01:25:42,372 --> 01:25:43,771
We want to free ourselves from

739
01:25:43,807 --> 01:25:47,538
this inferiority complex towards
teachers behind their desks.

740
01:25:47,577 --> 01:25:50,011
If you want me to come out
from behind my desk

741
01:25:50,047 --> 01:25:51,742
during my lessons,
you just have to ask.

742
01:25:51,782 --> 01:25:54,546
There shouldn't be any more desks,
lessons or exams.

743
01:25:54,584 --> 01:25:56,381
Lessons are natural events.

744
01:25:56,420 --> 01:26:01,289
As oysters produce pearls,
so teachers give lessons.

745
01:26:01,325 --> 01:26:05,352
Let's not go too far,
I learned something in university.

746
01:26:05,395 --> 01:26:07,693
What's taught at university
is how to obey

747
01:26:07,731 --> 01:26:09,323
and hence to command,

748
01:26:09,366 --> 01:26:11,698
because what's learned
with authoritarianism

749
01:26:11,735 --> 01:26:14,067
can be taught only
with authoritarianism.

750
01:26:14,104 --> 01:26:16,368
But if there's no exam,
how can you tell

751
01:26:16,406 --> 01:26:18,636
whether or not
the student has learned?

752
01:26:18,675 --> 01:26:20,575
It's not right that
a person who's studied is treated

753
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:22,077
in the same way
as someone who hasn't studied.

754
01:26:22,112 --> 01:26:24,444
There have always been
the clever and the stupid,

755
01:26:24,481 --> 01:26:27,041
...people of merit or not.
- Racist!

756
01:26:27,084 --> 01:26:29,985
No, it's completely natural.
I think it's our precise duty

757
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:32,580
to verify who is the cleverest
because it's on them

758
01:26:32,622 --> 01:26:34,647
that the future of our country depends.

759
01:26:34,691 --> 01:26:36,784
The sole merit of your "clever people"

760
01:26:36,827 --> 01:26:39,352
is to have been born into
a rich or cultured family,

761
01:26:39,396 --> 01:26:42,092
while those you call stupid
come from poor families!

762
01:26:42,132 --> 01:26:44,794
You give good votes to those
who can speak well...

763
01:26:44,835 --> 01:26:46,564
...to those who can come here,

764
01:26:46,603 --> 01:26:51,370
to those who can live and breathe
your middle-class culture.

765
01:26:51,408 --> 01:26:54,707
Your discrimination is based
on class, not merit!

766
01:26:54,745 --> 01:26:56,474
That's not true, there are children

767
01:26:56,513 --> 01:26:58,140
of country people and workers here.

768
01:26:58,181 --> 01:27:05,587
Yes, but only 7%, and of those
just 1% manage to graduate.

769
01:27:05,622 --> 01:27:10,889
The middle-class forms
10% of the Italian population

770
01:27:10,927 --> 01:27:14,055
but supplies 90% of the graduates

771
01:27:14,097 --> 01:27:17,396
which will form the future ruling class.

772
01:27:17,434 --> 01:27:20,267
The remaining 10% are supplied

773
01:27:20,303 --> 01:27:23,568
by 90% of the Italian population.

774
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,206
Assuming that you're not so racist

775
01:27:26,243 --> 01:27:30,839
to believe that the stupidity
of the working class is innate,

776
01:27:30,881 --> 01:27:33,714
you can't avoid recognizing
that Italian universities

777
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,809
are universities of class.

778
01:27:35,852 --> 01:27:38,377
Yes, but I can't resolve those problems.

779
01:27:38,422 --> 01:27:42,415
I do my best to understand students
from any class,

780
01:27:42,459 --> 01:27:44,154
and no-one can deny that

781
01:27:44,194 --> 01:27:46,594
when I examine a student I always say:

782
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:49,394
"Use your own words,
use your own words".

783
01:27:49,433 --> 01:27:51,060
Paternalist!

784
01:27:51,101 --> 01:27:54,195
Paternalism's the mirror image
of authoritarianism,

785
01:27:54,237 --> 01:27:56,603
two sides of the same coin.

786
01:27:56,673 --> 01:27:58,197
Let's speak openly...

787
01:27:58,241 --> 01:28:03,543
Even though I should have power,
I feel I have none.

788
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:06,413
You don't know this,
but people have been bad

789
01:28:06,450 --> 01:28:09,146
ever since the Twelve Tables.
The strongest survive...

790
01:28:09,186 --> 01:28:11,848
It's pointless to object...
"Homo homini lupus".

791
01:28:11,888 --> 01:28:14,516
You'll understand when
you'll have a family,

792
01:28:14,558 --> 01:28:16,526
a job and children...

793
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,790
You're young now and it's normal.

794
01:28:18,829 --> 01:28:21,127
No, for us "being young" doesn't mean

795
01:28:21,164 --> 01:28:23,291
"not being adults yet".

796
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:25,699
There's no difference between
the generations,

797
01:28:25,735 --> 01:28:28,033
there's just
the difference between people

798
01:28:28,071 --> 01:28:30,596
who have a critical,
dialectic position regarding reality

799
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:33,234
and those who passively submit to it.

800
01:28:33,276 --> 01:28:35,210
The logic behind your arguments

801
01:28:35,245 --> 01:28:38,043
is the logic of the inevitable betrayal
in becoming an adult.

802
01:28:38,081 --> 01:28:40,481
It's the logic you followed

803
01:28:40,517 --> 01:28:43,645
and since you don't want
to assume your responsibility

804
01:28:43,687 --> 01:28:46,747
you're trying to devalue our movement
to a matter of age,

805
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:48,781
youth or other similar banalities.

806
01:28:48,825 --> 01:28:50,952
I won't permit you
to use that kind of language!

807
01:28:50,994 --> 01:28:52,928
Stop arguing with these stiffs,

808
01:28:52,963 --> 01:28:54,794
it's a waste of time,
don't you understand?

809
01:28:54,831 --> 01:28:58,130
You're a scoundrel, a buffoon.
Show me your card.

810
01:28:58,168 --> 01:28:59,829
I won't show you anything!

811
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:01,428
You don't scare me, you know!

812
01:29:01,471 --> 01:29:03,029
You ARE scared!

813
01:29:03,073 --> 01:29:07,840
Ho Chi Minh!
Ho Chi Minh!

814
01:29:07,878 --> 01:29:12,440
Ho Chi Minh!
Ho Chi Minh!

815
01:29:14,751 --> 01:29:18,687
Ho Chi Minh!
Ho Chi Minh!

816
01:29:31,968 --> 01:29:33,458
Calm down, calm down!

817
01:29:33,503 --> 01:29:36,301
You won't get anywhere
by hitting each other!

818
01:29:36,339 --> 01:29:39,536
Let's discuss, let's discuss!

819
01:29:40,143 --> 01:29:43,340
That's enough,
return to your places!

820
01:29:45,382 --> 01:29:50,342
Let me give you my thoughts
about this agitation.

821
01:29:51,821 --> 01:29:54,654
You must understand
that the university

822
01:29:54,691 --> 01:29:58,627
is in a disastrous situation
on every level:

823
01:29:58,662 --> 01:30:00,892
Students, professors, structure.

824
01:30:00,931 --> 01:30:05,300
You could genuinely say
that the established order

825
01:30:05,335 --> 01:30:07,633
is in reality organized chaos.

826
01:30:07,671 --> 01:30:09,502
The professorial chair
as baronial fiefdom,

827
01:30:09,539 --> 01:30:12,099
the police-like attendance checks,

828
01:30:12,209 --> 01:30:15,007
are all elements
of a crisis and putrefaction

829
01:30:15,045 --> 01:30:17,775
for which and against which
you've acted.

830
01:30:17,814 --> 01:30:21,045
Obviously one could talk
about all this in more detail,

831
01:30:21,084 --> 01:30:23,575
but in any case...

832
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:26,612
In my opinion it's necessary to move on

833
01:30:26,656 --> 01:30:28,283
from this nebulous stage

834
01:30:28,325 --> 01:30:32,318
and build the basis of a collective,
democratic organization

835
01:30:32,362 --> 01:30:33,954
which alone makes possible

836
01:30:33,997 --> 01:30:37,899
the new experiments and hypotheses,
that are...

837
01:30:38,368 --> 01:30:40,563
Fire, fire!

838
01:30:41,238 --> 01:30:44,833
Good! Good!

839
01:30:46,843 --> 01:30:49,004
I'm sorry about
your little book, professor,

840
01:30:49,045 --> 01:30:50,672
but we don't care about your fetishes.

841
01:30:50,714 --> 01:30:53,342
But this is a violence
that hides your lack of ideas.

842
01:30:53,383 --> 01:30:55,351
No, it's a provocation.

843
01:30:55,385 --> 01:30:57,580
But you're putting
yourselves at the level

844
01:30:57,621 --> 01:30:59,782
of fascists and Nazis,
they burned books too.

845
01:30:59,823 --> 01:31:02,451
What's your indiscriminate
hatred for culture all about?

846
01:31:02,492 --> 01:31:05,052
What you call 'culture',
with a capital 'C',

847
01:31:05,095 --> 01:31:08,121
is just the bad conscience
of middle-class society.

848
01:31:08,164 --> 01:31:12,498
If you were a true Marxist
you wouldn't be here accusing us.

849
01:31:12,535 --> 01:31:14,366
You've shown
that you haven't understood

850
01:31:14,404 --> 01:31:17,703
that when a middle-class person
condemns political violence

851
01:31:17,741 --> 01:31:21,302
he masks his fear
using skilful moralistic accusations.

852
01:31:21,344 --> 01:31:25,405
"There's no politics here",
says the middle-class person,

853
01:31:25,582 --> 01:31:29,109
but we assert
the political nature of our action.

854
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:32,952
The system is violent
in dividing society into classes

855
01:31:32,989 --> 01:31:36,481
and maintains itself
through institutions like schools

856
01:31:36,526 --> 01:31:38,187
at the beck and call of capital.

857
01:31:38,228 --> 01:31:41,061
But you all have a great fear,

858
01:31:41,097 --> 01:31:43,327
a middle-class fear of violence,

859
01:31:43,366 --> 01:31:45,960
and you're indignant about police violence

860
01:31:46,002 --> 01:31:49,768
as if it were illogical,
unnatural and irrational.

861
01:31:49,806 --> 01:31:52,673
But it's not true,
it's the necessary violence

862
01:31:52,709 --> 01:31:54,836
of the system defending itself.

863
01:31:54,878 --> 01:31:57,005
Against this violence of the masters

864
01:31:57,047 --> 01:32:01,347
you persist in defending lawfulness,
the masters' lawfulness...

865
01:32:01,384 --> 01:32:03,318
...which is of itself violent.

866
01:32:03,353 --> 01:32:05,821
So, like Brecht, we say:

867
01:32:05,855 --> 01:32:08,153
"Only violence serves,
where violence reigns".

868
01:32:08,191 --> 01:32:10,955
That means theorizing in favor
of insurrection and terrorism.

869
01:32:10,994 --> 01:32:13,690
Don't you realize
that's playing the fascists' game?

870
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:15,664
But fascism is neither a concept

871
01:32:15,699 --> 01:32:17,189
nor a moment of the spirit,

872
01:32:17,233 --> 01:32:18,632
it's the masters' weapon.

873
01:32:18,668 --> 01:32:21,136
Miss, I agree with you.
But as long as you continue

874
01:32:21,171 --> 01:32:22,570
to theorize in favor of violence...

875
01:32:22,605 --> 01:32:26,234
For us violence isn't a principle,
it doesn't interest us.

876
01:32:26,276 --> 01:32:29,871
If you place obstacles in our path
we'll overcome them,

877
01:32:29,913 --> 01:32:33,542
if violence is necessary we'll use it.

878
01:32:33,583 --> 01:32:35,744
We're for the abolition of war.

879
01:32:35,785 --> 01:32:41,155
We don't want war, but war
can be abolished by war alone.

880
01:32:41,191 --> 01:32:43,250
Until there are no longer arms,

881
01:32:43,293 --> 01:32:44,817
it's necessary to take up arms.

882
01:32:44,861 --> 01:32:47,591
Don't you realize I'm not your enemy?

883
01:32:48,331 --> 01:32:50,492
You keep saying a horizontal line

884
01:32:50,533 --> 01:32:52,797
separates the academics from the students

885
01:32:52,836 --> 01:32:55,361
but in my opinion the line's vertical...

886
01:32:55,405 --> 01:32:57,737
On the one hand there are
academics and students

887
01:32:57,774 --> 01:32:59,969
who think the university's
got to stay as it is and,

888
01:33:00,009 --> 01:33:03,240
on the other hand,
there are those who want to change it.

889
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:06,578
It's clear which side I'm on.

890
01:33:06,883 --> 01:33:08,942
We agree you're not all the same

891
01:33:08,985 --> 01:33:10,782
but it's pointless
looking at each individual case.

892
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:13,448
As professors
in our class-conscious university

893
01:33:13,490 --> 01:33:16,516
you're our enemies because
you're tools of a repressive system.

894
01:33:16,559 --> 01:33:18,754
That's absurd!
Students against professors...

895
01:33:18,795 --> 01:33:22,128
If the students and professors
made a united front

896
01:33:22,165 --> 01:33:24,690
then the struggle
for reform would be...

897
01:33:24,734 --> 01:33:27,760
Reform and batons are two means
to reach the same objective:

898
01:33:27,804 --> 01:33:29,897
The consolidation of the system.

899
01:33:29,939 --> 01:33:32,100
That's extremism, stupid extremism!

900
01:33:32,142 --> 01:33:33,734
Why don't you want to understand

901
01:33:33,777 --> 01:33:35,301
that every struggle for progress

902
01:33:35,345 --> 01:33:37,745
is a struggle that moves towards
the socialist objective...

903
01:33:37,781 --> 01:33:41,148
...I say that if you're able
to transform and improve

904
01:33:41,184 --> 01:33:45,120
the structure of universities,
it will be your best contribution

905
01:33:45,155 --> 01:33:49,387
to the struggle for the country's
socialist reform.

906
01:33:49,426 --> 01:33:51,986
You mean for its
capitalist rationalization!

907
01:33:52,028 --> 01:33:55,088
We believe that a struggle
isolated in the universities

908
01:33:55,131 --> 01:33:57,258
would have no revolutionary results.

909
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:01,566
That's why our movement
rejects making simple demands.

910
01:34:01,604 --> 01:34:03,697
Today, becoming organized
like trade unions

911
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:06,265
means delegating
your own struggle to the parties

912
01:34:06,309 --> 01:34:09,278
and refusing to be political,
and we reject that.

913
01:34:09,312 --> 01:34:10,711
That's just cheap indifference...

914
01:34:10,747 --> 01:34:12,578
and mistrust of political parties!

915
01:34:12,615 --> 01:34:15,106
No, it's not a general rejection
of every party,

916
01:34:15,151 --> 01:34:18,211
it's a conscious rejection
of a certain kind of struggle

917
01:34:18,254 --> 01:34:20,916
that tries to imprison
every revolutionary drive

918
01:34:20,957 --> 01:34:23,187
in middle-class parliamentarianism.

919
01:34:23,226 --> 01:34:26,627
That's just hot air!

920
01:34:26,663 --> 01:34:29,154
Be concrete, if you can!

921
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:32,828
Silly, stupid idiots!
Ignorants!

922
01:34:32,869 --> 01:34:36,862
We believe in
the student movement's potential

923
01:34:37,507 --> 01:34:43,377
that being closely connected
to the university structure

924
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,407
must understand
the relation of this structure

925
01:34:46,449 --> 01:34:49,077
to the whole capitalist
structure of which it's a part.

926
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:51,985
But you don't see how
the struggle will develop over time.

927
01:34:52,021 --> 01:34:54,512
Out of your struggle will come
a democratic university

928
01:34:54,557 --> 01:34:56,787
no longer aimed at
preparing you for the industry

929
01:34:56,826 --> 01:34:59,192
or subject to capitalist interests.

930
01:34:59,229 --> 01:35:02,596
It won't be just technicians
who come out of this university,

931
01:35:02,632 --> 01:35:06,090
not just the passive executors
of social exploitation.

932
01:35:06,135 --> 01:35:08,000
That's why I'm talking about

933
01:35:08,037 --> 01:35:10,904
the institutionalization
of the results of your struggle...

934
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:15,070
It would be a great result
against the conservative forces

935
01:35:15,111 --> 01:35:17,773
to undermine them
in a centre of privilege.

936
01:35:17,814 --> 01:35:19,714
Then tomorrow you can
take up the struggle again

937
01:35:19,749 --> 01:35:21,307
from a more advanced position.

938
01:35:21,351 --> 01:35:22,943
So you don't really
want to understand.

939
01:35:22,986 --> 01:35:25,284
We don't believe
in a university that's different

940
01:35:25,321 --> 01:35:28,449
or even legalized
to be against the system.

941
01:35:28,491 --> 01:35:31,722
University can't become
a happy island of socialism

942
01:35:31,761 --> 01:35:33,626
inside a capitalist society.

943
01:35:33,663 --> 01:35:34,857
You speak in bad faith!

944
01:35:34,898 --> 01:35:37,128
The system only tolerates
those reforms

945
01:35:37,166 --> 01:35:39,600
that don't change
current class relationships.

946
01:35:39,636 --> 01:35:42,161
This means that
the system is unassailable

947
01:35:42,205 --> 01:35:45,003
so what are we struggling for?

948
01:35:45,074 --> 01:35:47,508
You might as well just wait
for it to blow itself apart.

949
01:35:47,544 --> 01:35:48,602
There's no need to prove that

950
01:35:48,645 --> 01:35:50,078
you're even stupider than we thought.

951
01:35:50,113 --> 01:35:53,173
You know very well that a new system,
a socialist system,

952
01:35:53,216 --> 01:35:58,381
can't gradually build itself
inside the old capitalist system.

953
01:35:58,421 --> 01:36:01,322
The current ruling class
wouldn't allow itself

954
01:36:01,357 --> 01:36:04,849
to be expropriated bit by bit,
sector by sector.

955
01:36:04,894 --> 01:36:07,158
A global strategy is needed,

956
01:36:07,196 --> 01:36:09,528
the question of power
must be addressed.

957
01:36:09,566 --> 01:36:12,000
- Right, that's what I was just saying...
- "Right" what?!

958
01:36:12,035 --> 01:36:14,595
Listen, I'm ready for
the inevitable wolf-whistles

959
01:36:14,637 --> 01:36:16,537
but I'll say it in any case
since it's what I think.

960
01:36:16,573 --> 01:36:18,200
The problem, in my opinion,

961
01:36:18,241 --> 01:36:21,233
isn't to conduct
a sectional isolated struggle

962
01:36:21,277 --> 01:36:24,906
but to return to the fundamental
political crux of the matter,

963
01:36:24,948 --> 01:36:29,510
to reconnect to those political forces

964
01:36:29,552 --> 01:36:32,043
that have been fighting for decades

965
01:36:32,088 --> 01:36:34,215
for democratic socialist change
in our country.

966
01:36:34,257 --> 01:36:36,885
- That's enough about the CP!
- Revisionist!

967
01:36:36,926 --> 01:36:39,053
- Sell-out!
- Conformist!

968
01:36:39,095 --> 01:36:43,191
Chairman Mao says,
"Some Western capitalist countries

969
01:36:43,232 --> 01:36:46,463
tolerate the legal presence
of communist parties

970
01:36:46,502 --> 01:36:48,436
only to the extent that they

971
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:51,872
do not damage
fundamental middle-class interests.

972
01:36:51,908 --> 01:36:55,571
Beyond those limits
they are no longer tolerated."

973
01:36:55,612 --> 01:36:58,706
Student power!
Student power!

974
01:36:58,748 --> 01:37:02,707
- That's enough stock phrases!
- You're a stock professor!

975
01:37:03,152 --> 01:37:07,384
Student power means much more
than power to the students.

976
01:37:07,423 --> 01:37:10,654
It means not accepting the role
of the professional in society,

977
01:37:10,693 --> 01:37:13,560
it means overcoming
the isolated condition of the student,

978
01:37:13,596 --> 01:37:16,258
it means mass mobilization.

979
01:37:17,166 --> 01:37:19,430
The whole movement must stem

980
01:37:19,469 --> 01:37:23,428
from a clearly
anti-capitalist conscience.

981
01:37:23,473 --> 01:37:26,840
With this conscience
the students make social actions

982
01:37:26,876 --> 01:37:30,243
and connect
with forces against the system,

983
01:37:30,279 --> 01:37:32,144
and they mature through direct contact

984
01:37:32,181 --> 01:37:36,208
with the needs of the working class
which they try to interpret

985
01:37:36,252 --> 01:37:38,652
in a way that provokes
revolutionary conflict.

986
01:37:38,688 --> 01:37:40,417
That's why "student power"

987
01:37:40,456 --> 01:37:42,447
doesn't mean trade union demands

988
01:37:42,492 --> 01:37:44,357
but fully-involved political work.

989
01:37:44,394 --> 01:37:46,954
For God's sake,
that's not the problem!

990
01:37:46,996 --> 01:37:50,090
The problem is
that you're all intellectuals

991
01:37:50,133 --> 01:37:51,930
so you can only find opportunities

992
01:37:51,968 --> 01:37:54,596
for revolutionary struggle
within the Party!

993
01:37:56,105 --> 01:37:59,199
Why can't you see that if
the students demonstrate today

994
01:37:59,242 --> 01:38:02,177
it's not to have more rooms
or to have the accounts published,

995
01:38:02,211 --> 01:38:04,111
it's because they're fighting
against the system

996
01:38:04,147 --> 01:38:06,547
or at least
they're starting to fight against it!

997
01:38:06,582 --> 01:38:08,345
- Yes, of course!
- 'Of course' what?!

998
01:38:08,384 --> 01:38:10,818
Why do you think they're not doing it
in the traditional way?

999
01:38:10,853 --> 01:38:14,186
Why do you think they no longer pass
through the parties?

1000
01:38:14,223 --> 01:38:16,953
Because they're fed up with
the democratic route to socialism,

1001
01:38:16,993 --> 01:38:19,052
with the appeals for anti-fascist unity.

1002
01:38:19,095 --> 01:38:21,256
You must understand that our power

1003
01:38:21,297 --> 01:38:24,630
comes from the crisis in your strategy.

1004
01:38:24,667 --> 01:38:27,431
What crisis?!
You're making me lose my patience!

1005
01:38:27,470 --> 01:38:31,133
Is it just you
who has the right to lose patience?!

1006
01:38:31,174 --> 01:38:34,803
And why do you always
take it out on the Communist Party?

1007
01:38:34,844 --> 01:38:36,141
Just look at you!

1008
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:38,340
For aggressive revolutionary politics

1009
01:38:38,381 --> 01:38:40,645
you need a self-discipline
that you can only dream of,

1010
01:38:40,683 --> 01:38:43,914
plus heroic willpower
and a capacity for suffering.

1011
01:38:43,953 --> 01:38:45,511
And let me say that you seem

1012
01:38:45,555 --> 01:38:47,716
to have fun with your revolution,

1013
01:38:47,757 --> 01:38:50,920
but remember a revolution
is not a variety show

1014
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:52,757
and this is not a stage!

1015
01:38:52,795 --> 01:38:55,025
This is a farce that's teaching us a lot.

1016
01:38:55,064 --> 01:38:58,693
First of all to despise
those who we used to fear.

1017
01:38:58,735 --> 01:39:00,327
Look, if you talk like that

1018
01:39:00,369 --> 01:39:03,634
I'll tell you what I really think
about you and your comrades.

1019
01:39:03,673 --> 01:39:05,971
You're a shoddy
minority of pro-Chinese,

1020
01:39:06,008 --> 01:39:07,566
you're irresponsible and fanatical,

1021
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:10,101
you want to deceive
the majority of students

1022
01:39:10,146 --> 01:39:11,841
who want to change the university

1023
01:39:11,881 --> 01:39:14,179
and who know the how,
the when and the limits.

1024
01:39:14,217 --> 01:39:15,946
And I must say something else...

1025
01:39:15,985 --> 01:39:19,045
you're ungrateful,
because if the Communist press

1026
01:39:19,088 --> 01:39:22,387
hadn't been on your side,
if our MP's...

1027
01:39:22,425 --> 01:39:25,986
You would have been...
Children!!!

1028
01:39:27,230 --> 01:39:28,959
The police!

1029
01:39:30,633 --> 01:39:34,364
I'm against it in principle,
but these are provocations...

1030
01:39:34,403 --> 01:39:36,701
they're irresponsible provocateurs.

1031
01:39:36,739 --> 01:39:41,233
I'm against it in principle,
but in this case it's necessary.

1032
01:39:43,045 --> 01:39:46,344
We're here to restore order
to this chaos!

1033
01:39:46,916 --> 01:39:49,749
You'll be sorry for what you've done.

1034
01:39:53,356 --> 01:39:55,517
You've overstepped all the limits...

1035
01:39:56,225 --> 01:40:00,525
Every limit...
of reasonableness. Inspector!

1036
01:40:01,297 --> 01:40:04,494
In the name of the law
I order you to leave this room.

1037
01:40:05,701 --> 01:40:07,328
Come on!

1038
01:40:08,504 --> 01:40:11,302
Hit them hard, go on!

1039
01:40:20,283 --> 01:40:23,116
Why don't they feel any pain?

1040
01:40:27,723 --> 01:40:29,953
Give it to me, give it to me!

1041
01:40:30,026 --> 01:40:34,360
Bastards, I know you're
in the service of foreign powers.

1042
01:40:34,397 --> 01:40:38,231
You're crazy,
where do get this courage?

1043
01:40:42,505 --> 01:40:46,805
Rogues! Jailbirds!
Long live the police!

1044
01:40:46,843 --> 01:40:49,141
Long live the police!

1045
