1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
RAILS

2
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,300
I'll pay tomorrow...

3
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,000
Were you afraid?...

4
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,700
But... why?

5
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
Because I love you...

6
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,600
Where are we going?...

7
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,300
Where the others go...

8
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,400
You won't suffer any more, darling...

9
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,500
Honeymoon?

10
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,800
Up already?

11
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,600
You've no idea how long this sport
has been a passion of mine.

12
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,900
There's your sport!

13
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:30,000
"My dear friend, allow me to send this small gift
to our very own 'Mascot', who won us so much
money last night! ..."

14
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,800
"... We will be expecting you today at 5 for tea.
Yours, Jacques Mercier"

15
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,700
I'll never play with you, not even over 
a glass of water. You're too lucky!

16
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,800
Do you love him dearly?

17
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,700
The lady does not feel very well.

18
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,700
You've left me alone all evening.

19
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,700
We've been here for so long...
Why don't we leave?

20
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,900
Leave? And renounce our luck, now?

21
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,800
I don't expect the ring
will be worth very much.

22
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,400
He's still losing...

23
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,400
There must be a misunderstanding!
The gentleman and I play as partners.

24
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,600
We'll split the winnings.
Were we not playing as partners?

25
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,000
In your situation such
touchiness is out of place.

26
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:30,800
"Kind friend,
Would you please drop by at 11?
I have something that may interest you.
Yours, Mercier"
