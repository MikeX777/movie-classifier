178
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:50,623
Swift wrote "Lover" as a
reflection of her personal life,

179
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:55,076
describing it as
very confessional and autobiographical,

180
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:58,424
yet also playful and whimsical.

181
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:02,186
She also said the album
was a love letter to love

182
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:06,328
in all of its maddening,
passionate, exciting, enchanting,

183
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:09,159
horrific, tragic,
wonderful glory.

00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:17,686

00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:23,312
♪ Can we always be this close

187
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:27,177
[Narrator] The track
list consists of 18 songs,

188
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:29,386
more than any of
her other albums,

189
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:33,286
depicting many sentiments
stemming from love.

190
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:35,911
[gentle music]

191
00:10:37,257 --> 00:10:41,156
The imagery of "Reputation"
was dark and cold.

192
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:45,782
"Lover" 's bright colors
and themes contrasted this.

193
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:49,164
However, a common misconception
is that "Reputation"

194
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:51,580
lyrically is all about revenge.

195
00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:54,307
Although some songs
do touch on this,

196
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:57,725
the majority of the album
details falling in love with Joe

197
00:10:57,726 --> 00:11:00,106
amidst all the personal tumult.

198
00:11:00,107 --> 00:11:03,213
[gentle music]

199
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:06,181
"Lover" acts almost
as a sister album,

200
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:09,288
further detailing
the relationship and the highs and lows

201
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:11,324
of what she had
been going through.

202
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:14,949
In the closing track,
"Daylight," Swift contemplates

203
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,678
that love to her now is golden,
rather than burning red,

204
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,577
as she once believed, a
reference to the title track

205
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:25,131
of her 2012 Studio album, "Red."

206
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:28,479
[gentle music]

207
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,069
The song represents Swift's
mature understanding of love,

208
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,831
her personal life,
and her public image.

209
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:37,489
[gentle music]

210
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,147
Although mainly positive,

211
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:44,012
some critics felt as though
"Lover" was a bit too much

212
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:47,947
like an unnecessary course
correction from "Reputation,"

213
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:49,673
rather than a
collection of themes

214
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:52,607
Swift was really
interested in pursuing.

215
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:55,334
The album features
some career highlights,

216
00:11:55,335 --> 00:12:00,063
"Cruel Summer,"
"Lover," "Cornelia Street," and "Daylight."

217
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:03,549
However, fans often feel as
though the album is too long

218
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,690
and includes some of
Swift's worst work today,

219
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:09,418
including the lead single, "ME!"

220
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:14,111
Because of "Reputation" 's
poor critical success,

221
00:12:14,112 --> 00:12:17,459
many believe Swift wanted to
distance herself completely

222
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,463
and start new with the pop
sounds and bright colors.

223
00:12:21,464 --> 00:12:24,466
Both albums have now
become fan favorites

224
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:26,296
and have received their flowers,

225
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:28,816
but at the time it
seemed as though Taylor

226
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:31,473
was at a crossroads
with her career.

227
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:33,993
Although she was still
doing well commercially,

228
00:12:33,994 --> 00:12:37,100
she wasn't at the height she
was at a couple years prior,

229
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:39,240
during her "1989" era.

230
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:40,793
[gentle music]

231
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:44,486
The ongoing Kanye feud and
relentless tabloid scrutiny

232
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:46,488
had taken a toll on Taylor.

233
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:49,008
[gentle music]

234
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:52,771
In April, 2020, Taylor
Swift was set to embark

235
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,808
on Lover Fest, her
sixth concert tour

236
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,568
in support of the album.

237
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:01,607
However, the tour was canceled
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

238
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:04,438
[dramatic music]

239
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:13,274
On July 23rd, 202O,
nine captionless black and white images

240
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:16,656
of Taylor standing alone
in the woods were uploaded

241
00:13:16,657 --> 00:13:19,142
to Swift's Instagram account.

242
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:20,591
She posted another message

243
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,835
on all of her social
media platforms

244
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,044
saying that her
eighth studio album

245
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:27,564
would be released at midnight.

246
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:31,085
Swift stated, "Most of the
things I had planned this summer

247
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:32,845
didn't end up happening,

248
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:36,987
but there is something I hadn't
planned on that did happen,

249
00:13:36,988 --> 00:13:41,198
and that thing is my eighth
studio album, 'Folklore.'"

250
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,823
[wind blowing softly]

251
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,102
The creation of the album
was totally unexpected.

252
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:50,000
Whilst Taylor was in quarantine,

253
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:54,142
she watched numerous films,
from "LA Confidential,"

254
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:57,905
"Jane Eyre," "Rear Window,"
and "Marriage Story."

255
00:13:57,906 --> 00:14:01,149
She also read more books
than she ever had before.

256
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,807
Books that dealt
with times past,

257
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:06,120
a world that doesn't
exist anymore,

258
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:09,813
such as "Rebecca" by
Daphne du Maurier.

259
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:12,195
The fiction encouraged
Swift to write songs

260
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:14,853
that weren't strictly
autobiographical,

261
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,580
and instead experimented with
alternative points of view.

262
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:21,411
She allowed her
imagination to run wild

263
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:24,103
when she was alone during
the period of lockdown,

264
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:26,623
creating a series of
thoughts and visuals

265
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:29,074
that later became "Folklore."

266
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:31,698
[gentle music]

267
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:38,324
"Folklore" was supposed to
be released in early 2021,

268
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:41,258
but it ended up
being done earlier

269
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:45,814
and released without a
second thought in July, 2020.

270
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:47,816
She approached the
album's creation

271
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:50,612
without subjecting
herself to any rules,

272
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:54,133
and explained that she used
to put all these parameters

273
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:58,448
on herself like, how will
this song sound in a stadium?

274
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:01,037
How will this song
sound on the radio?

275
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:04,419
If you take away all the
parameters, what do you make?

276
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,388
And I guess the
answer is "Folklore."

[gentle music]

278
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:16,811
Swift told Billboard,
"It started with imagery,

mind and peaked my curiosity.

the scent of loss

Battleships sinking into
the ocean, down, down, down.

woods of my childhood.

285

Hushed tones of, 'Let's run
away' and never doing it.

286
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:45,633
The sun-drenched
month of August,

287
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:48,567
sipped away like
a bottle of wine.

A mirrored disco ball
hovering above a dance floor.

for better or worse,

293
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:08,656
Pretty soon these images
in my head grew faces

294
00:16:08,657 --> 00:16:11,831
or names and became characters.

295
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:14,765
I found myself not only
writing my own stories,

296
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,906
but also writing about
or from the perspective

297
00:16:17,907 --> 00:16:21,324
of people I've never
met, people I've known,

298

or those I wish I hadn't."

[soft dramatic music]

300
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:30,057
For "Folklore, Swift's lyrics
veered towards escapism

301
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:31,541
and romanticism.

302
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:35,545
She enlisted two producers
to achieve her desired sound,

303
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:38,582
her longtime collaborator,
Jack Antonoff,

304
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,722
with whom she'd
previously collaborated

305
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:44,762
on the albums "1989,"
"Reputation," and "Lover,"

306
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,108
and Aaron Dessner,

307
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:52,010
guitarist for the American
indie rock band, The National.

308
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:56,221
Due to COVID-19 concerns,
Swift, Antonoff, and Dessner

309
00:16:56,222 --> 00:16:59,362
quarantined remotely
separate from each other,

310
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:02,537
creating "Folklore"
by continually exchanging digital files

311
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:05,402
of instrumentals and vocals.

312
00:17:05,403 --> 00:17:08,509
The album ensued
from a DIY process,

313
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:13,514
mixed and engineered
by personnel scattered across the US.

314
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:16,793
"Folklore" was written
and recorded in secrecy.

315

Swift, her boyfriend,
family, management team,

316
00:17:20,315 --> 00:17:24,283
Antonoff, and Dessner were
aware of the album's creation.

317
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:26,941
She did not disclose the
news or play the album

did with her previous works.

National band mates,

"Folklore" asserts
something that has been true

from the very start
of Swift's career.

327
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:58,697
Her biggest strength
is her storytelling,

328
00:17:58,698 --> 00:18:02,149
but this time her sound
departed from pop maximalism

329
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:06,291
and synth-driven to an
alternative indie folk sound.

331
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:12,780
The stories told in
"Folklore" include a ghost

that discovers its
murderer at its funeral,

traumatized friend,

an elderly widow shunned
by her community,

and a love triangle

between the fictional
characters, Betty, James,

337
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,971
and an unnamed woman, as
depicted in the tracks

and "August,"

three songs written

character's perspective

videos for "Folklore."

crew on the visuals

Beth Garrabrant.

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,591
where she would have
100 people on set

350
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:07,628
commanding alongside
other people

351
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:09,871
in a very committee fashion.

352
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:13,910
She styled herself, including
hair, makeup, and wardrobe,

353
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:17,880
and prescribed Garrabrant
a specific moodboard.

354
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,298
The black and white,
gray-scale filter on the photos

355
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:24,369
gives them their
distinguishing look.

356
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,580
[soft dramatic music]

357
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:31,617
Swift departs from the
technicolor carnival

358
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:34,172
of its predecessor, "Lover,"

359
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:38,348
and adopts a rustic,
nature-focused, cottage-core aesthetic

360
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:43,251
for "Folklore" that reflects
its lyrical ideas of escapism.

361
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:48,772
She opens the music video for
"Cardigan" by settling down

362
00:19:48,773 --> 00:19:52,466
at an old piano an a
quaint cabin in the woods.

363
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:55,123

[Narrator] The album
was instantly hailed

374
00:20:25,362 --> 00:20:29,779
as Swift's magnum opus, met
with widespread critical acclaim

375
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,437
from critics and fans alike.

376
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:35,578
"Folklore" shows Swift
at her most vulnerable,

377
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:39,340
the emotional weight and
introspective songwriting

378
00:20:39,341 --> 00:20:43,517
made it her most sophisticated
and subdued body of work.

379
00:20:43,518 --> 00:20:46,659
[soft dramatic music]

380
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:51,283
She uses the eccentric
debutante, Rebekah Harkness,

381
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,941
who married into the
standard oil dynasty

382
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:56,806
and once lived in Swift's
Rhode Island house,

383
00:20:56,807 --> 00:21:00,706
in her story in "The Last
Great American Dynasty"

384
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:03,916
to celebrate women who
have a marvelous time

385
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,711
ruining everything.

386
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:08,335
[soft dramatic music]

387
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:11,338
You're able to visualize the
song's events in your head

388
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:15,583
like a tale because it is rich
with historical information

389
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:18,206
and Americana imagery,

390
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:20,105
but it also makes a
powerful statement

391
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:23,073
about how society
views outspoken women.

392
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,697
[soft dramatic music]

393
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:29,839
At the conclusion, Swift
skillfully creates a distinction

394
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,117
between Harkness and herself.

395
00:21:32,118 --> 00:21:35,328
[soft dramatic music]

396
00:21:39,677 --> 00:21:41,816
The album has been
contextualized

397
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:44,440
as the quintessential
lockdown album,

398
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:46,614
and felt like the
perfect accompaniment

399
00:21:46,615 --> 00:21:50,169
for the weird
loneliness of 2020.

400
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,794
It is hailed as the
first great pandemic art.

401
00:21:53,795 --> 00:21:55,554
"Folklore" and
its songs received

402
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:59,455
five Grammy-Award nominations
at the 63rd ceremony,

403
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:01,284
winning the Album of the Year.

404
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:03,148
Swift became the
first woman in history

405
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:05,840
to win Album of the Year thrice,

406
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:07,670
and the fourth artist overall,

407
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:12,502
tied with Frank Sinatra,
Stevie Wonder, and Paul Simon.

408
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:15,713
[soft dramatic music]

409
00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:25,239
On December 10th, 2020, Swift
once again surprised her fans

410
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,104
with the announcement of
her ninth studio album

411
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:31,314
and "Folklore"'s sister
record, "Evermore."

412
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:33,730
She described "Evermore"
as an offshoot

413
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:35,560
of the Folklorian woods.

414
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:37,700
[gentle music]

415
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:40,910
Swift and Dessner continued
to collaborate virtually.

416
00:22:40,911 --> 00:22:43,602
After the release of
"Folklore," he would give her

417
00:22:43,603 --> 00:22:47,088
instrumental recordings, to
which she would add vocals.

418
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:49,401
[gentle music]

419
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:52,197
She stated the rave
reception of "Folklore"

420
00:22:52,198 --> 00:22:56,339
encouraged her to experiment
further with its musical style.

421
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,549
"Evermore" was dubbed
"a weird avalanche,"

422
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,519
effecting from
"Folklore" by Dessner.

423
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:07,177
"Evermore" 's creation was
a more experimental process

424
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,041
than its predecessor was,

425
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:11,665
during which the duo did
not subject themselves

426
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,356
to any limitations.

427
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:16,015
[gentle music]

428
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:21,951
Much like "Folklore,"
on December 10th, 2020,

429
00:23:21,952 --> 00:23:24,919
three days prior to
her 31st birthday,

430
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,922
Swift posted nine
photos on Instagram,

431
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:31,132
which together formed an image
depicting the singer's back,

432
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:34,999
with her hair in a braid,
and facing a forest.

433
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,589
Swift wrote, "You've all
been so caring, supportive,

434
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,729
and thoughtful on my birthdays,

435
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,594
and so this time I thought
I would give you something.

436
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:46,389
I also know this holiday season

437
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,598
will be a lonely
one for most of us,

438
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:51,463
and if there are any of you
out there who turn to music

439
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:54,328
to cope with missing
loved ones the way I do,

440
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:55,640
this is for you."

442
00:23:57,781 --> 00:24:00,230
Prior to the "Willow"
music video premiere,

443
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:04,027
Swift said she likens
"Evermore" to fall and winter,

444
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:08,653
in contrast to
its predecessor's, spring and summer.

[gentle music]

457
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:43,688
[Narrator] "Evermore"
is a personal album

458
00:24:43,689 --> 00:24:46,829
that has a strong foundation
in character studies,

459
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,833
narrative mythmaking,
and complex first-person storytelling

460
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:52,870
from third-person views.

461
00:24:54,182 --> 00:24:57,149
It further explores the
fantastical universe that Swift

462
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,429
created with "Folklore," by
using fact and imagination.

463
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,122
[gentle music]

464
00:25:04,123 --> 00:25:07,539
The escapist themes of
both albums are similar,

465
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,474
but "Evermore" is bolder,
unrestrained, frivolous,

466
00:25:11,475 --> 00:25:15,167
and impressionistic, digging
deeply into Swift's concepts

467
00:25:15,168 --> 00:25:18,792
of adult love and grief,
in contrast to "Folklore" 's

468
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:22,416
more introspective and
sentimental nature.

469
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:25,040
[gentle music]

470
00:25:26,904 --> 00:25:30,113
It was at this point in Swift's
career that she was regarded

471
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:33,082
as the songwriter
of her generation.

472
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:35,705
These two albums were
career-redefining,

473
00:25:35,706 --> 00:25:38,466
and threw emphasis on
Swift's work ethic,

474
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:41,331
helping critics recognize
her musicianship,

475
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,851
now viewing her as
a dedicated singer

476
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:47,337
moving away from her pop
star image in the mid 2010s.

477
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,962
[gentle music]

478
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:56,726
Being a Taylor Swift
fan is hard work,

479
00:25:56,727 --> 00:25:58,590
and she doesn't make it easy.

480
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:00,696
Ever since the beginning
of her music career,

481
00:26:00,697 --> 00:26:03,146
the singer has constantly
left Easter eggs

482
00:26:03,147 --> 00:26:06,184
within her work to
leave fans guessing.

483
00:26:06,185 --> 00:26:09,152
Whether it be hidden
messages in lyric booklets

484
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:12,155
or teasing albums
months in advance,

485
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:17,196
Swift has been the queen of
teasing fans since day one.

486
00:26:18,473 --> 00:26:19,922
"It's sort of a
tradition that we started

487
00:26:19,923 --> 00:26:22,338
a very long time ago,"
Swift said to Jimmy Fallon

488
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:24,789
about the origins
of her Easter eggs.

489
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,653
"I think the first time
that I started dropping

490
00:26:26,654 --> 00:26:31,416
sort of cryptic clues in my
music was when I was 14 or 15,

491
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:33,142
putting together
my first album."

492
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:35,903
[gentle music]

493
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,664
While Swift stopped
this tradition

494
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:39,631
during the "Reputation" era,

495
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:42,807
she had a habit of hiding
messages in her old work.

496
00:26:42,808 --> 00:26:45,188
Specifically, she
would hide liner notes

497
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:48,985
in the lyrics of each of her
songs in her CD booklets.

498
00:26:48,986 --> 00:26:52,955
From "Fearless" to "Red," all
of her lyrics were lowercase

499
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:54,819
and the message
could be deciphered

500
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,373
through the capitalized letters.

501
00:26:57,374 --> 00:26:59,962
For "1989," she
did the opposite.

502
00:26:59,963 --> 00:27:01,688
[gentle music]

503
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:04,552
During these eras,
Swift's dating life

504
00:27:04,553 --> 00:27:07,659
was often much more
publicized than it is now.

505
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,698
The singer even used her
music to address her romances,

506
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:14,978
from hidden messages
to pointed lyrics.

507
00:27:17,256 --> 00:27:19,913
Some of her references
were more obvious,

508
00:27:19,914 --> 00:27:23,192
as the liner message
for "Should've Said No,"

509
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:25,850
just said the name
Sam repeatedly,

510
00:27:25,851 --> 00:27:29,923
addressing a former boyfriend
who allegedly cheated on her.

511
00:27:29,924 --> 00:27:32,580
Others were more subtle,
like the liner note

512
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:36,792
for "Last Kiss," being,
"Forever and always,"

513
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:39,795
a reference to a song
title from her former album

514
00:27:39,796 --> 00:27:42,556
that is said to be
about Joe Jonas.

515
00:27:42,557 --> 00:27:44,316
[gentle music]

516
00:27:44,317 --> 00:27:47,595
As the "Reputation" album
kicked into full gear,

517
00:27:47,596 --> 00:27:49,839
the music video for
her lead single,

518
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,084
"Look What You Made Me Do,"
was full of Easter eggs.

519
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:55,845
Since she wasn't doing
interviews during this era,

520
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:58,089
Swift said it was her
way of communicating

521
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,816
and staying connected
to her fans.

522
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:04,060
"Literally the whole video
is just an Easter egg,"

523
00:28:04,061 --> 00:28:06,304
she said to
Entertainment Weekly.

524
00:28:06,305 --> 00:28:08,444
"There are thousands
of Easter eggs.

525
00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:11,102
There are some that people
still haven't found.

526
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:14,519
It will be decades before
people find them all."

528
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:20,594
One of Swift's biggest
Easter eggs came in the form

529
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:24,253
of an Instagram post
in April of 2020,

530
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:26,980
when she shared a photo
of herself with a caption,

531
00:28:26,981 --> 00:28:29,396
"Not a lot going
on at the moment."

532
00:28:29,397 --> 00:28:32,088
Given that this was during
the height of the pandemic,

533
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:35,367
fans did not consider this
an Easter egg at the time.

534
00:28:35,368 --> 00:28:38,336
Of course, once the singer
revealed she was releasing

535
00:28:38,337 --> 00:28:42,202
her eighth studio album,
"Folklore," all became clear.

536

[gentle music]

537
00:28:48,105 --> 00:28:50,831
As "Folklore" 's release
had fans scrambling

538
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:53,075
to figure out all
her Easter eggs,

539
00:28:53,076 --> 00:28:56,181
one major one was
William Bowery,

540
00:28:56,182 --> 00:28:58,736
who was credited on
two "Folklore" tracks

541
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,015
and is later credited
on three for "Evermore."

542
00:29:02,016 --> 00:29:05,156
Swifties were quick to figure
out that William Bowery

543
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:09,091
was a pen name for Swift's
boyfriend Joe Alwyn,

544
00:29:09,092 --> 00:29:11,921
as his great-grandfather's
name was William Alwyn,

545
00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:14,821
and the Bowery Hotel was
where Swift and Alwyn

546
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:17,099
first hung out in 2016.

Swift confirms William
Bowery's identity

549
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:23,553
in her Disney Plus
film, teasing that,

550
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:26,625
"William Bowery is
Joe, as we know."

552
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:35,738
On February 11th,
2021, she announced

553
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:38,223
on "Good Morning America"
that the rerecording

554
00:29:38,224 --> 00:29:41,157
of "Fearless," to which
she added the subtitle,

555
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:43,815
"Taylor's Version," was
the first in the series

556
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:45,817
of her rerecorded albums.

[gentle music]

558
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:52,824
She released an anagram-filled
video from the vault,

559
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:55,447
which referred to all
of her unreleased songs

560
00:29:55,448 --> 00:29:56,794
from the album.

561
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,417
"The vault door is
about to be as unhinged

562
00:29:59,418 --> 00:30:02,316
as you think I am after
you watch this video,"

563
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:04,698
she said on social media.

564
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:07,563
"Level: Expert.
Happy, decoding."

00:30:09,704 --> 00:30:12,637
Fans managed to decode
the titles of the six new

567
00:30:12,638 --> 00:30:16,089
vault tracks and the name
of one of her collaborators,

568
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,471
Keith Urban, who is
featured on a song.

569
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:21,577
The vault tracks Swift
wrote when she was

570
00:30:21,578 --> 00:30:25,132
in her teenage years and
intended to include in,

571
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:29,585
but ultimately left out of the
original "Fearless" release.

572
00:30:29,586 --> 00:30:33,140
Swift said by including
these unreleased tracks,

573
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:35,556
which she absolutely adored

574
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:38,387
but were held back
for different reasons,

575
00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:41,666
the rerecorded album
proved that the artist

576
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:45,152
is the only one who really
knows that body of work.

577
00:30:45,153 --> 00:30:47,707
[gentle music]

578
00:30:49,537 --> 00:30:51,227
The same arrangements and lyrics

579
00:30:51,228 --> 00:30:54,299
are used as they were on
the original recordings,

580
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,543
which prompted numerous
critics to note

581
00:30:56,544 --> 00:30:59,891
that a casual listener might
not know any differences,

582
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:01,824
but underlined
that the production

583
00:31:01,825 --> 00:31:03,964
includes more
defined instruments,

584
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:06,899
a crisper mix, and
greater quality.

585
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:11,040
Journalists described
"Fearless [Taylor's Version]"

586
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:13,318
as a key event in
raising awareness

587
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:16,183
for artists' rights
in the music industry.

588
00:31:16,184 --> 00:31:18,737
They considered that
Taylor's Version branding

589
00:31:18,738 --> 00:31:22,224
an effective strategy
in mobilizing Swift fans

590
00:31:22,225 --> 00:31:27,194
to consume the rerecorded
album over the original.

591
00:31:27,195 --> 00:31:31,336
The album debuted at number
one on the Billboard 200 chart,

592
00:31:31,337 --> 00:31:33,718
a return to the number one spot,

593

would be released on
November 19th, 2021

that were meant to be
on the 2012 version.

She also teased the original
10-minute-long version

of the fan favorite
track, "All Too Well,"

603

requested by fans,

On August 5th, Swift
posted a cryptic video

across her social media
teasing a word puzzle

for the fans to solve.

609
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:34,882
It's spelled out, "Chris
Stapleton," "Phoebe Bridgers,"

610
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:39,611
"Babe," "Better Man," and "All
Too Well 10 Minute Version."

612
00:32:45,135 --> 00:32:50,071
Swift revealed a teaser for
"All Too Well: The Short Film."

613
00:32:51,521 --> 00:32:54,661
The Teaser showed a vintage
car driving past a road

614
00:32:54,662 --> 00:32:58,561
bounded by autumnal woods, and
it was written and directed

615
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:03,291
by Swift, starring herself,
Sadie Sink, and Dylan O'Brien.

616
00:33:04,672 --> 00:33:07,985
This song has always been
hailed as Swift's magnum opus

617
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,056
by critics and fans.

618
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:12,299
The song details the
story of her breakup

619
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,474
with actor Jake Gyllenhaal.

621
00:33:17,202 --> 00:33:21,170
Before "All Too Well" was cut
down to a 10-minute version

00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:25,105
and then more to a final five
minute and 28 second version,

with whom Swift wrote the song,

625
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:32,734
believed it was probably
a 20-minute song.

626
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:37,704
Memories are the building
blocks of "All Too Well."

627
00:33:37,705 --> 00:33:40,707
The song relies on specifics
of the rise and fall

628
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:43,917
of a romantic relationship
drawn from memory.

more expository details,

"All Too Well [10
Minute Version]"

632
00:33:51,581 --> 00:33:56,171
provides greater context
than the five-minute version.

633
00:33:56,172 --> 00:33:58,828
Swift mentions the age
difference between her

634
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,796
and the subject several times,

635
00:34:00,797 --> 00:34:03,557
and states how the subject
used it as an excuse

636
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:05,421
to terminate their relationship,

637
00:34:05,422 --> 00:34:08,286
but continued to date
women of her age.

638
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:11,082
She recollects the
buildup and intensity

639
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:15,121
of falling in love and
acknowledges her naivety.

640
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:18,158
The track was met with
universal critical acclaim,

641
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,127
often hailed as the
standout track on "Red"

642

and a career
highlight for Swift.

According to Swift, the
subject matter of "Midnights"

679
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:25,906
was inspired by five
major topics, self-hatred,

680

revenge fantasies, wondering
what might have been,
