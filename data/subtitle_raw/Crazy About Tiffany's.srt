1
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:18,337
New York is place
where people come

2
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,339
to have
their dreams realized.

3
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:23,342
And I think
that's why so many people

4
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:26,178
not only come
to this city,

5
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,447
but, ultimately,
make their way to Tiffany.

6
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,349
Do I know how to give
good fucking bites,

7
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:31,817
- or what, people?

8
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,355
Look, just roll away
and then I'll babble on.

9
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:37,756
Tell me when it's boring.

10
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,525
Well, you know, I mean
a company like Tiffany

11
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,193
which is very old,
you know,

12
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:42,361
there's a lot
of context to it.

13
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:43,862
I'm not uninterested in it.

14
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,198
Do you think
we should celebrate brands?

15
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,266
No.

16
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,667
I called up my manager

17
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,370
and I said, "i have to pay
my jewelry bill."

18
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:53,405
I said, "any movie
that comes down the pike,

19
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,474
any horrible
piece of crap."

20
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,409
So I did
this horrible movie--

21
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,212
there are few American
retail outlets

22
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,781
that are true institutions.

23
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,183
Bergdorf,

24
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,717
Tiffany's...

25
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,352
7-Eleven.

26
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,388
I'm wearing
lots of Tiffany today.

27
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,722
Are you?

28
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,559
I'm wearing this
Jackie o cuff,

29
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,394
and...

30
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:16,728
My zipper necklace.

31
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,832
- Fuck! Yes!

32
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,535
I want something
that I feel amazing in.

33
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,937
Like, the look
we're trying to create

34
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,405
for this particular--

35
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:27,639
-event.
-Event.

36
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,593
Tiffany box.

37
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,728
- You're getting--
-engaged?

38
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,931
--You're getting engaged!

39
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,000
-Oh, my god!
-Oh, my god--

40
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,836
-no, stop it.
-What are you d--

41
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,672
-stop it.
-No! No!

42
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,810
- You can't-- -

43
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,415
the branding, that blue box
with the white ribbon,

44
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,849
is unequivocal.

45
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,851
If you see that box
under the Christmas tree,

46
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,853
if you see that box
on a birthday,

47
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,355
you know
you're getting something

48
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:24,856
really, really special.

49
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,558
And that is not an accident.

50
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,927
That is a lot of very,
very clever people

51
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,363
spending a lot
of time and energy

52
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,365
thinking about
this brand positioning.

53
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,533
Where they're gonna sit
in relation

54
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,701
to their competitors,

55
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,703
and exactly where
they want to be.

56
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,739
It's our most recognizable
brand quality

57
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,607
and therefore,
it has to be perfect

58
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:43,942
and it has to be right.

59
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,545
People have a big affinity
with that color.

60
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:49,414
I think it's such
a recognizable brand color

61
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,719
that, of course,
people have very positive
associations with it.

62
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,721
You know what? I'm just
gonna take it all away.

63
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:58,056
'Cause that way, you'll just
really learn the lesson, okay?

64
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,825
All righty.

65
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,727
Well, I'm gonna run
a couple of errands

66
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:03,128
and I will see you
at dinner.

67
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,568
She took all my stuff.

68
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,069
Yeah...

69
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,638
Everything but
the little blue one.

70
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,807
That's the best one.

71
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,610
Oh, my god.
Thank you so much.

72
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:19,945
I would love to have

73
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,947
many of those
little blue boxes.

74
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,549
So, yes, as a woman
i definitely understand

75
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,752
the addiction to those
little blue boxes.

76
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,954
It happens to be
such a beautiful color.

77
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:31,923
The Tiffany blue
is what you would call

78
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,025
a "Robin's egg blue."

79
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,594
It's a sophisticated color

80
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,729
but it has
some green undertone.

81
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,764
Obviously,
working for Tiffany,

82
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,065
we use it
day in, day out.

83
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,067
We apply it
in so many different ways

84
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,504
and I think we really try
to get that right,

85
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,172
it's a very difficult
color to mix,

86
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:49,741
it's a very difficult color
from a production standpoint

87
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:50,809
to get right.

88
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,644
It changes
depending upon

89
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,012
whether
it's a painted surface,

90
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,647
a printed fabric surface,

91
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,416
a sprayed finish.

92
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,884
The number of Tiffany blue

93
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,519
is 1837.

94
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:04,623
And that was specifically
requested by Tiffany

95
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,159
as the time when Tiffany
first started.

96
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:10,829
The Tiffany blue formula
is a closely guarded secret

97
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,965
that pantone has developed
specifically for Tiffany,

98
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,002
and that's something
that is only sent out

99
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,738
by Tiffany
to their privileged partners.

100
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,107
People are trade marking
dumb stuff these days

101
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,142
but an institution
like Tiffany's

102
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:27,579
deserves to own
that color blue.

103
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,147
They made that blue.

104
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,583
That blue was nothing
until Tiffany's came along.

105
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:36,655
When Tiffany wanted to create
this image and consistency

106
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,824
with all their packaging
and media,

107
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:41,927
we knew that we had
to infuse that color

108
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:44,996
with some of the same
strong pigments,

109
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,731
and consistent pigments,

110
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,901
into that color
to allow consistency.

111
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,169
Otherwise, it'll fade.

112
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,839
Color is synonymous
with the brand.

113
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,707
So we're seeing this
more and more.

114
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,843
Even celebrities today

115
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,778
are branding themselves

116
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,714
with, uh, we produced
a color for Jay-Z.

117
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,649
He has his own signature blue.

118
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,852
But kanye west
had come to us--

119
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:09,187
I don't know, we got--
we got into the rap world.

120
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:14,893
I'm not talkin'
about "rich,"

121
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:17,596
I'm talkin'
about "wealth," okay?

122
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,030
I'm talkin'
about the white family

123
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,032
that owns
all the fuckin' similac,

124
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,034
those rich motherfuckers,
okay?

125
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,736
I'm talkin' about
the white family

126
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,271
that owns the color blue.

127
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,673
Those rich bastards,
okay?

128
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,209
No choice of color
has ever been so successful

129
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,911
in the history of marketing.

130
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:35,046
In 1853,
the empress eugenie

131
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,716
was the greatest fashion icon
of her period.

132
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:40,085
She was our kind
of 19th-century grace Kelly.

133
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:43,555
And, as empress of France,
she chose an official color,

134
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,991
this Robin's egg,
pale turquoise blue,

135
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,726
as her official color

136
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,728
since whatever
the empress eugenie did

137
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,730
was going to be
a worldwide success

138
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,231
and followed by everybody.

139
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,966
And that blue
was going to become

140
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,735
the world's
number one color.

141
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,671
Mr. Tiffany brilliantly
jumped on the opportunity

142
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,607
and immediately made it
Tiffany's official color.

143
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,910
Tiffany blue
is such a well-known color.

144
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:07,579
I actually got
the pantone swatches

145
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,614
and had a fabric
matched to it.

146
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,583
I kept trying to say,
"i want this blue,

147
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:14,286
I want this light blue,
it's all about a light blue."

148
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:17,088
And they kept coming back
with a Robin's egg.

149
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,924
And I kept saying,
"no, no, no, no.

150
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,258
Tiffany blue.
Tiffany blue."

151
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,193
And then,
i finally had to go

152
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:25,597
and we dip dyed, um,
fabric and a dress to match.

153
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,098
And you'll be seeing it
on the red carpet

154
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,101
very soon.

155
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,321
Estee.

156
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,790
That's amazing.

157
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,258
- Give it to me.

158
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,226
With the--
with the bathing suit tan.

159
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,228
- That's hilarious.
- -I mean, you have to just,

160
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,331
-you have to just go--
-you just have to go--

161
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,665
-own it, and be like--
-yes. Yes.

162
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,033
... "yep, off I go."

163
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,234
-Jeans are incred--
-jeans are brilliant.

164
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,636
The rubber band around the--

165
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:05,737
look at my watch.

166
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:09,007
- Whoopsie.

167
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,976
It's fun, but it's...
It is intense

168
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:14,279
because it's not--it's not
to be taken lightly, you know?

169
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,914
-Right.
-You're presenting yourself

170
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,282
-in a particular way
-right.

171
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,750
- Because it's my business.
- -Right.

172
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,318
But, you know, I was 19--

173
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,153
not wearing high heel
flip flops anymore.

174
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,822
Right, no more
high heel flip flops

175
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,324
- and tan lines and crop tops.
- -Right.

176
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,193
I didn't know any better.

177
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:30,261
--Most people don't.

178
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,163
This is no event
in the whole world

179
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,832
as important as the oscars

180
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,900
in terms of celebrity
product placement.

181
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,836
Everyone sees it.

182
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:41,172
And--and when
i do magazines

183
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,408
or advertising,
my mom sees it,

184
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,877
and my friends see it,
my peers see it.

185
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,880
But I don't think it has
this sort of, like, broad reach.

186
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,017
Jewelry on the red carpet
is a very complicated game.

187
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,019
I think it's big
because it's so competitive,

188
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,787
it's so valuable
for brands.

189
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,055
It's different
with everybody.

190
00:10:57,057 --> 00:11:00,392
I mean, I have
a handful of jewelers

191
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,927
that I work with
for a red carpet dressing.

192
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,397
And I've had
relationships with them
for a very long time.

193
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,098
I've had a relationship
with Tiffany

194
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,700
for many, many years.

195
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,769
I've had tremendous
success with them--

196
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:11,903
jewelry, there's
a tremendous amount

197
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,938
of payola,
tremendous amount.

198
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,076
It is not unusual
for jewelers

199
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,378
to be courting the talent

200
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,914
with checks.

201
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,416
The stakes are high
and the payoff is great.

202
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,885
The brands want
that positioning,

203
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,054
and the actresses also want
that exclusivity

204
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,389
of being the only girl
in the best dress.

205
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,092
The only girl
with the best necklace.

206
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,261
Oh, my god,
it's so gorgeous.

207
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,196
Yeah, have a look.
Pass the mirror

208
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,199
and look at that 'cause
that's really fabulous.

209
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,069
- You see?
-Yes, I can.

210
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:47,939
- It is so crazy.
-What do you think?
How does it feel on?

211
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:51,409
-It feels... perfect.
-I mean, it feels
amazing, doesn't it?

212
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,079
And just the way it sits
and the way it moves.

213
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,481
- It's... amazing.
- -It's gorgeous.

214
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,216
Wow.

215
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,351
What's great about the oscars
is all of a sudden

216
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:03,121
these exciting pieces
that you've never seen before,

217
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,457
you know, magically appear
'cause I think they...

218
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,325
Everyone keeps
like, a little--

219
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:11,062
their little special stash
for that time of year.

220
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,134
Gorgeous.

221
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,936
- Isn't it? Isn't it?
- -It's so beautiful.

222
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,938
I don't even know
what to say about it.

223
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,139
What kind of stone is that?

224
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,474
That's an aquamarine.

225
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,476
-So beautiful.
-My birthstone.

226
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,144
- Is it?
- -Wow.

227
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,179
--See, I knew this was--

228
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,447
I was kindred spirits
with this Jewel.

229
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,116
You knew
you could feel it.

230
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,218
-It was calling you.
-God, I love this.

231
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,519
So, Jessica's amazing.

232
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:38,123
She has that mixture
of--of glamour,

233
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,524
which can go back
to another time,

234
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,793
but she's also
very contemporary.

235
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,529
This is where I, sort of,
put all my designs up

236
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,464
and this sort of gives
a good idea

237
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,933
of the overall feeling
of where we're going

238
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,135
as a design team.

239
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,137
And this is
the initial drawing

240
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,805
for your necklace
that you have on.

241
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,140
It's already yours.

242
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,374
We've been looking at doing

243
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,543
these fabulous earrings,
drop earrings,

244
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,311
and a bracelet
with tassels

245
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:03,414
that, again, will have
that fluid feeling.

246
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,083
We did a lot of wreaths
in the past,

247
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,417
but the beauty
about this piece

248
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,153
is that there are
pear-shaped diamonds

249
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,188
going in one direction.

250
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,824
It's having a presence,
and it's having a presence

251
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,560
on somebody, you know,
as gorgeous as her.

252
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,262
I mean, especially
around "blue book."

253
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,164
Especially when people
will come to "blue book"

254
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,532
and they will see
some of the pieces

255
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,333
that she wore at the oscars.

256
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,803
It adds an enormous amount
of value.

257
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,305
The "blue book" is an upper.

258
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,840
You know, when it comes
in the mail

259
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,441
no one's allowed
to throw it away.

260
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,110
You can just look at it
and you can dream with it.

261
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,546
A lot of people
just collect Tiffany, you know,

262
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,416
and--and look forward
to "blue book" all year.

263
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,218
"Blue book"
is about stones.

264
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,354
It's about finding
the most phenomenal stones.

265
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,624
Some of the pieces
are just gonna be so stunning

266
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,459
and so seductive,

267
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:25,396
I'm hoping that I will
fall in love with one of them

268
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:29,067
and so will, you know,
one of the wealthiest people
in the world.

269
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,502
Now, being a mother
of twin 8-year-olds

270
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,938
I rarely have time
for the cathartic

271
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,239
retail experience.

272
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,908
But they do know
about Tiffany's.

273
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,443
Those wonderful, blue books
that arrive at the house

274
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,645
and they see mommy
looking at the jewelry,

275
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,246
and I show them
the jewelry.

276
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,515
And, in fact,
this past Valentine's day,

277
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,284
one of my twin daughters
came up to me and said,

278
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,319
"mommy, what do you want
from Tiffany's

279
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,321
for Valentine's day?
I'll tell daddy."

280
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:24,956
And--and it was
very cute.

281
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,624
She told him I wanted
the love ring,

282
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,626
only my husband
ended up buying

283
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,128
the Elsa peretti love ring

284
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,396
and I was actually
talking about

285
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,064
the Paloma Picasso
love ring.

286
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,933
And so, I was
very fortunate.

287
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,234
At the end,
i got both rings

288
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,969
because both of my daughters

289
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:41,039
wanted to be represented
in this Valentine's moment.

290
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,609
With a sense of fantasy
and luxury and imagination.

291
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,645
I have a pin
of the, um, little bird

292
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,181
standing on--sitting on
a stone, which I love.

293
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,150
Every time I wear it,
people go, "oh, my goodness.

294
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:55,954
That's amazing.
It's a remarkable piece."

295
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,656
I'm wearing this ring now
that had been my grandmother's

296
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,258
that, I think, is from--

297
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,060
it's Paloma Picasso
when she first started.

298
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,329
I think from
mid-seventies.

299
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:08,199
It's two stones.
It's a, um, an amethyst

300
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,101
and I think
it's an aquamarine,

301
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,469
but it might be
a blue topaz.

302
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,071
My grandmother
gave it to me.

303
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,006
She often would, you know,
give you a piece

304
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,741
here or there,
and this she gave me.

305
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,209
- Hi... oh!

306
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:21,012
- Oh, no!
-What happened?

307
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,014
Fluffy--oh, sorry.

308
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:28,753
- What happened?
-It's my daughter.

309
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,555
Are you wearing
anything Tiffany?

310
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:33,124
Uh, no, I'm not.

311
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,026
She has, though.

312
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:36,394
Yeah, she's next in line
for everything.

313
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:37,996
--Either Serena or fluffy,

314
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,697
and I don't think
fluffy wants it, so...

315
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:44,068
- Oh, he can come here.

316
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,603
It's all right,
he can come in.
Come in, come here.

317
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:51,042
- Wow, look at that.
-Big baby.

318
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:53,544
So Francesca's
blue book theme is "water,"

319
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:56,014
-did you know that?
-I did hear it, yeah.

320
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,415
- You did hear that?
-I did hear that, yeah.

321
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,550
She can be quite
secretive, Francesca.

322
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,553
She definitely can
'cause I haven't seen a thing.

323
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,088
It's more that she's,
i think,

324
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,090
focused on something
and maybe, you know,

325
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:09,427
not ready to sort of pull
it out and bear it just yet

326
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:13,031
for me to go, "ugh,"
or me to go, "wow."

327
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,399
Or me to go,
"what the fuck are you doing?"

328
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:16,100
Or, you know,
or any of those things.

329
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,736
But I do remember
sort of hearing whispers

330
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:21,706
that there were possibilities
that she was gonna get this job

331
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,243
at Tiffany, and it was one
of those ones where suddenly

332
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,779
it just felt all the stars
had aligned in the right place

333
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:30,214
and Francesca was right
in the epicenter.

334
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,584
It felt right, it felt like
she had earned it

335
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,587
because she has been
doing this for a long time.

336
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,357
I think there's
two things that help me.
One, I'm a woman.

337
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,426
Surprisingly, the first
design director

338
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,261
for Tiffany
that's a woman.

339
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,762
And it's kinda great

340
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,597
'cause, you know,
i try the jewelry on

341
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,599
and I wear it,
and I feel it.

342
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,468
I have to, I mean,
i want to.

343
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,071
If I don't wear it,
i can't make decisions on it.

344
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,273
This is something that needs
to sit on the body.

345
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,607
I have to wear it.

346
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,443
And then, secondly,
is the fact

347
00:17:58,445 --> 00:17:59,844
that I'm-- I'm a trained
jeweler.

348
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,113
So I'm gonna think
about the construction.

349
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,315
It's just
ridiculously perfect

350
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,117
that she looks
like Audrey hepburn,

351
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,286
and she's designing
for Tiffany.

352
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,263
The way that I design

353
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,332
is I really start
with a concept.

354
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:24,469
And then, from the concept,
i create a story.

355
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:27,472
When you're going through
"blue book," you know,

356
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:31,209
you'd sort of feel
very happy in here,
"aren't these fun?

357
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,877
"Aren't these great?
Oh, these are a bit unusual."

358
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:35,146
And I think here you have
an element of surprise

359
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,281
that then leads you
onto here.

360
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,650
We've obviously pushed
the boundaries this year.

361
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,352
You know, this is not
going to be

362
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,454
your everyday "blue book."

363
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,889
It does have
classical pieces,

364
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,492
but it also has
some very unusual pieces.

365
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:50,128
Which, I think, is why
we're so excited about it.

366
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,164
There's two things
that I'm thinking while
I'm doing that--

367
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,733
so one is the look
and feel of it,

368
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,835
and the other thing
was just to fragment it

369
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,871
into, you know, ice,

370
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:03,274
snow, dew drops,

371
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,876
to create these...

372
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:07,145
These different subthemes,
in a way.

373
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,380
And then how they're gonna
rhythmically sit

374
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,915
one next to the other.

375
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,518
You can approach it with,
you know, colored stones.

376
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,253
You can approach it
through diamonds.

377
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,889
You can approach it
through something much bigger.

378
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,705
Here we have about...

379
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,375
I'd say over $20 million
worth of diamonds.

380
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,377
So, these are all
fancy colors.

381
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,512
So we've got a bit
to play around with today.

382
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,215
That one... so this
is a sort of...

383
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:47,185
Beautiful.
This is like rain.

384
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,453
- Nice splashes of rain.
- -It's wonderful.

385
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:54,559
But we don't wanna go down
the route of fountains
and showers, you know?

386
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,894
We want to keep it
really pure.

387
00:19:56,896 --> 00:20:00,865
And the style has to sit well
with what's happening

388
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,401
with watches,
let's say for example.

389
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,636
And it has to also reflect
what we're doing

390
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:08,372
in the fashion jewelry,
so that it's one voice.

391
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,341
It becomes-- it becomes a
vocabulary,

392
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:11,742
so that if you're wearing
a Tiffany watch

393
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:12,910
with a Tiffany necklace,

394
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,545
I know, you know?

395
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,581
I can see it from
the other side of the room,

396
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,782
that's Tiffany.

397
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:04,962
And how long did it take you

398
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,964
to set the Tiffany diamond?

399
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:11,035
-I think about two hours.
-Two hours.

400
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,904
That must have been
quite a moment.

401
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,039
Well, it's amazing
if you think

402
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,341
the history
that stone has.

403
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:18,909
It's quite amazing.

404
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,320
Don't you just love it?

405
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:30,821
Love what?

406
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,723
Tiffany's.

407
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,402
Isn't it wonderful?

408
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:45,836
Do you see what I mean,
how nothing bad

409
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,838
could've happened to you
in a place like this?

410
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,507
It isn't that I give a hoot
about jewelry,

411
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,509
except diamonds,
of course.

412
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,512
Like that.

413
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,352
There are only two women
in the world

414
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,354
that have worn her.

415
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:06,090
Uh, in 1961,

416
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:08,693
Walter hoving,
being the entrepreneur

417
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:10,928
and the publicist
that he was,

418
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,932
uh... decided to have
some film shots taken

419
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,367
here at the store.

420
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,969
And Ms. hepburn
wore the necklace,

421
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:21,038
uh, wore the diamond
in a necklace

422
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,940
designed by schlumberger.

423
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:27,778
In order for the production
to get access to Tiffany's,

424
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,815
they granted Tiffany's
a little photo shoot

425
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:34,552
with Audrey wearing
the Tiffany diamond necklace.

426
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,721
So they did a little bit
of a trade.

427
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:39,690
Paramount got
the store and...

428
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,059
The company got Audrey.

429
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,130
So she was the second woman.

430
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:50,735
The first woman
was a socialite in 1957.

431
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:54,438
Tiffany and company
was co-hosting a charity ball

432
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,574
up in Newport, Rhode Island.

433
00:22:56,576 --> 00:23:00,511
And the co-hostess,
Mrs. Sheldon whitehouse,

434
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:04,715
was actually the very first
woman to ever wear her.

435
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,424
He found the diamond,
the rough,

436
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:16,660
in the Kimberly mine
in South Africa.

437
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:19,663
It was 287-carats,
huge rough.

438
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,866
And he had the opportunity
to buy it.

439
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:26,670
Of course, enormous risk
to buy something like this.

440
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:29,440
One is never quite sure,
with that size of rough,

441
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:31,475
truly what you're going
to get out of it.

442
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:34,979
When you're cutting a rough
to a smaller diamond,

443
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:38,082
often many of the pieces
you're cutting away

444
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:41,118
are so included
that they're not really usable.

445
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,788
Maybe some
of the smaller pieces were,

446
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,957
but predominantly,
that is all weight loss.

447
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,627
So he took the risk,
he had a sense that there was

448
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:52,563
something within that
that was special.

449
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,799
So he bought the rough.

450
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,901
The rough was sent over
to Europe

451
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:58,702
and the first cut was made.

452
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,906
But there came out
the most incredibly brilliant,

453
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:04,008
beautiful diamond
with 82 facets.

454
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,643
Quite unique at that time.

455
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:07,978
Diamonds were not cut
with that many facets.

456
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,582
The wonderful thing
is you look at that
Tiffany diamond now

457
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:15,586
and it looks as modern
as if it were cut

458
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,988
last week, or a month ago,
or a year ago.

459
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,890
It's incredibly advanced.

460
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:23,160
So that's very special,
this is a very special diamond.

461
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:27,097
The security of her
is extremely tight, obviously.

462
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,834
But during my time
on the main floor,

463
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,869
we had, uh, a procedure

464
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,804
that after the store closed

465
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:37,074
and the stainless
steel doors were locked,

466
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,176
she was withdrawn
from the vault

467
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,711
on the main floor.

468
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,680
You had to wear
the white gloves,

469
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:44,048
and she was put
in her carriage

470
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,016
and whisked away
for the night.

471
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:48,486
There is a little secret.

472
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,155
One night, when I was removing
her from the case,

473
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:54,158
for just a moment-- I thought
about miss hepburn,

474
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,026
I thought about
Mrs. whitehouse,

475
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,229
they had both worn it
in a necklace.

476
00:24:58,231 --> 00:25:00,965
And I thought... "A tiara.

477
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,801
I could be the first person,
the first woman,

478
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:06,937
the first employee
that wore her as a tiara."

479
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:09,874
So, for a second,
i put her in my quaff

480
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:14,011
and I stood there,
and I was actually transformed.

481
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,247
Life is not measured

482
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:21,218
by the number of beats
that your heart makes,

483
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,920
life is truly measured

484
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:26,257
by the moments
that take our breath way.

485
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:30,227
- And that moment I will never forget.
- -It truly did?

486
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:32,963
Oh, it did.
I was breathless.

487
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,078
There's something amazing
about the fact

488
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,614
that the film begins
with the windows.

489
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,616
The windows
are the first opportunity

490
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,184
to spread
the Tiffany magic.

491
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:55,920
And that's why the film
begins that way.

492
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:57,321
You know,
she gets out of the car,

493
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:59,123
she look at the window

494
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,958
and she's instantly
transported.

495
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:12,970
In window one, she was looking
at these tall wooden structures.

496
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:16,240
They were kind of, like,
multifaceted wooden pieces

497
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:19,777
with beautiful
schlumberger bracelets on them.

498
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:23,747
In window two,
it's miniature chandeliers
suspended beautifully

499
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,950
with brooches
suspended within them.

500
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,651
They're tremendously
beautiful windows

501
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:30,921
and those were very iconic
gene Moore displays.

502
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,057
Perhaps that was
the first time that people

503
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,993
saw, on a global scale,
gene Moore's work.

504
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,748
It's fun.
It's all part
of the whole thing.

505
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,283
It's fun to do.

506
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:04,054
I love doing it even,
uh, after all these years.

507
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:07,157
Gene was really a pioneer
in modern window display.

508
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,660
Because in the past,
the idea was

509
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:12,696
cram as much as you could
into the window

510
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,231
and have
all the price tags on it

511
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,800
and it's all about
pushing the merchandise,

512
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,869
but gene distilled it.

513
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,738
He would show one
or two pieces,

514
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,073
but it was the way you got in
was you wanted to see

515
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,808
what he was gonna do
with the windows.

516
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,410
People have forgotten,
the new generation

517
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:28,012
doesn't really know.

518
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:31,015
I don't think that they know
the whole story.

519
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:35,986
I've been known to break
a glass in the window.

520
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:41,191
And that was fun because
people would call up and say,

521
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,427
"you know you have
a broken glass in the window?"

522
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:47,798
I say, yes, I know.
There's the hammer right
beside it that broke it.

523
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,036
I learned to do
things different--

524
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:55,205
uh, to make a difference,
because

525
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:58,242
I wanted to see how much
attention people paid to it.

526
00:27:58,244 --> 00:27:59,943
And they would
call up and say,

527
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:02,112
"do you know you have
one knife turned backwards?

528
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:04,848
Or one key
turned backwards?"

529
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,216
I said, "yeah."

530
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,452
And then I knew that
people looked at it.

531
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:10,154
It's the only way
i could check up.

532
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:26,437
Gene Moore had a wonderful
sense of wit in place.

533
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:30,174
He understood the whole theatre
of window design.

534
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:32,810
He took it to a place
that would use

535
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:36,980
incongruous objects
with beautiful jewelry.

536
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,934
I would walk around
the floor with gene,

537
00:28:56,936 --> 00:29:00,003
you know, selecting product
for the window.

538
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:02,072
He used to love to use eggs.

539
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,941
You know,
he used to blowout eggs

540
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:05,976
and use eggs
a different way.

541
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,444
Eggs, to me,

542
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,913
is the most perfect shape
in the whole world.

543
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,915
I like 'em the way
they come right out of the hen.

544
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,751
I don't believe in
painted eggs.

545
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,452
Eggs are not to be painted.

546
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,955
They are so beautiful
in themselves

547
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:20,257
that I'd leave them
the way they are.

548
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:24,795
It was always sort
of juxtaposed jewelry
and something unique.

549
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:26,797
He just did
whatever he wanted.

550
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,166
The labor that went into
creating those things

551
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:30,868
and the artists he engaged

552
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,370
because he did engage people
to work with him.

553
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,205
And they were on
his rolodex.

554
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:37,341
They were not on
anyone else's rolodex.

555
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:39,209
You were nev-- and they were
very true to him.

556
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:41,478
One of his most
spectacular windows

557
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,882
was a giant white sphere

558
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:47,217
hanging over
a strand of pearls.

559
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,286
And I'd put them in
and I thought,

560
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,822
something is wrong.

561
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:54,158
You know, it's-- it's too clean.

562
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,026
It's wrong.

563
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:59,029
So, I broke a string of Pearl--
i thought I'll catch hell,

564
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,397
but I broke a string
of pearls

565
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,833
and I had the pearls,
you know...

566
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:04,168
And it helped the window.

567
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,370
It made the window
as a matter of fact.

568
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:08,405
And only gene
would have been able

569
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,908
to get away with showing
damaged goods

570
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,976
in the windows at Tiffany's.

571
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,846
They the--teasing glimpse

572
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:20,150
into a world
that you want to be part of.

573
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,052
It was very humbling
to be thinking

574
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:24,822
I'm part of something
that's ended up

575
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:28,025
in a window at Tiffany's
on fifth Avenue.

576
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:29,459
I mean,
it's a privilege and a joy.

577
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:32,095
Imagine a house
of Tiffany's saying,

578
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:35,199
hey, go and make
anything you want,

579
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:40,204
and work with these
extraordinary crafts people
upstairs

580
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:44,441
who literally still
hand make the items.

581
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:47,878
Is that you, my lovely?

582
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:55,185
Daisy Buchanan,
"the golden girl."

583
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,387
A breathless warmth
flowed from her.

584
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:00,324
A promise that there was
no one else in the world

585
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:02,159
she so wanted to see.

586
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:04,328
Do they miss me in Chicago?

587
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,298
Uh, yes. Um--um,
at least a dozen people
send their love.

588
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,200
How gorgeous.

589
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,969
I've just been in China.

590
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:14,905
I've just released
"the great gatsby" in China.

591
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:17,207
Yes, they're dazzled
by all the luxury.

592
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:21,478
But they're also very aware
of the heart issue of the book.

593
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,916
And that is this paradox
between this roaring '20s,

594
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:29,887
where there's "such an orgy of
money," to quote Fitzgerald.

595
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:32,990
And then there's
this kind of devastation

596
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:36,293
in the American dream,
if you like.

597
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:38,662
There must be a center
and there must be meaning.

598
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:41,965
In the last ten years,

599
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,067
the people
have just experienced

600
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,402
a tremendous change.

601
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,537
Not just in their lifestyle,
but in the--

602
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:50,340
in the way they feel
about themselves.

603
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:53,277
A lot of Chinese
were starting to get wealthy

604
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,078
and they thought
with that wealth

605
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,915
they should treat themselves
a little bit better.

606
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,416
And they've got
to this point now

607
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,953
where, finally, they can
live a beautiful life

608
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:06,990
and they can start thinking
about what they really want

609
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,659
and not just
what they need.

610
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:11,061
This idea
of the American dream and--

611
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:14,231
and when you think
"American dream,
"Chinese dream,"

612
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:16,967
and the vision
that they both speak to,

613
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:19,503
you realize
that all the values

614
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:22,572
that they're selling
are universal.

615
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:25,008
I don't even want to own
anything till I can find a place

616
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,677
where a million things
go together.

617
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:29,046
I'm not sure
where that is, but--

618
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:32,482
--i know what it's like.

619
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:35,352
-It's like Tiffany's.
-Tiffany's?

620
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:38,588
-You mean the jewelry store?
-That's right.

621
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,991
I'm crazy
about Tiffany's.

622
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:44,227
Although Tiffany in its-- its
current incarnation

623
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:47,030
is not
a celebrity-driven brand,

624
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:51,068
the one celebrity
who is beyond reproach,
who is enduringly popular,

625
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,436
who will always
be associated

626
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:54,071
with the brand
is Audrey hepburn.

627
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:56,573
I was definitely
familiarized with--

628
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:58,542
with the whole notion
of Tiffany's

629
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:00,744
through the movie
"breakfast at Tiffany's."

630
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:03,347
For me when I was younger
seeing that movie,

631
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:06,616
seeing her and seeing
the name "Tiffany's,"

632
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:09,753
embodied everything
that was glamorous,

633
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:12,723
and slightly unattainable,
about New York.

634
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:14,424
Well, no, because
of the title,

635
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:15,726
great product placement

636
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:17,594
without needing-- without
meaning it.

637
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:21,264
Tiffany got lucky,
sort of in the same way that

638
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,734
Campbell's soup got lucky
with Andy warhol.

639
00:33:23,736 --> 00:33:26,503
It just happened
that this film was made.

640
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,673
It was not made for any kind
of advertorial purpose.

641
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:32,175
It's perfect.
It's a perfect image.

642
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,312
A lot of people confuse me
with Audrey hepburn. Um...

643
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:37,381
There are good things about it,
there are horrible things
about it.

644
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,016
- What's horrible?
-Mickey Rooney.

645
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:42,386
--Ugh! Ooh!

646
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:44,321
Mickey Rooney,
"breakfast at Tiffany's"?

647
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:47,224
Where's his Oscar?
Come on!

648
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:50,160
In 30 seconds
i got to call the police!

649
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:52,029
That's grotesque.
And, of course,

650
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:54,231
it was never actually "okay."
It was just allowed.

651
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:55,766
You know, all kinds of things
were allowed,

652
00:33:55,768 --> 00:33:57,034
doesn't mean they're okay.

653
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,802
I genuinely admire the movie.

654
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:01,705
I admire the risks
that were taken

655
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,807
by Audrey hepburn,
by Blake Edwards.

656
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:07,044
Mancini and, uh, givenchy.

657
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,384
You want a character
you're gonna love.

658
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,420
Well, at the time,
i--i--

659
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:18,422
I thought it was a very
interesting choice.

660
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:21,558
I mean, she had style.
She had class.

661
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,528
She had a quality, I think,
that--that worked.

662
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,431
I don't think people know
that she was sort of like, uh,

663
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:30,834
a prostitute-- high end kinda
prostitute in New York City,

664
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:33,303
trying to claw her way
up to the top.

665
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:37,274
I think when now they see it,
she looks like a socialite.

666
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:38,408
They think she is a socialite.

667
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,619
Won't you join me?

668
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,621
Yes, join Audrey hepburn

669
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,290
as you've never
seen her before--

670
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,358
kicking over the traces
and bringing to life

671
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,161
Truman capote's
"breakfast at Tiffany's."

672
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,865
Well, the first time I saw
"breakfast at Tiffany's,"

673
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:03,300
it didn't-- didn't cross my mind

674
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:05,268
that she was a prostitute.

675
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,305
Capote doesn't come
right out and say it,

676
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:11,141
but if you read
between the lines

677
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:14,778
it's something that
he wanted you to consider.

678
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,481
My mom told me afterwards,
and I was like, "what?"

679
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:19,649
Really? What'd she say?
She was like, "by the way--"

680
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:22,119
yeah, she was like,
"you know that she's
a call-girl?"

681
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,489
And I'm like, "wh--why?"

682
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:27,824
"What gave you that sense?"

683
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,826
But, yeah, I mean,
in retrospect,

684
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,262
I'm like, "okay,
it's a bit obvious

685
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:33,864
once you have that
in your mind."

686
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:35,866
- She's a hooker?
- -Are you surprised

687
00:35:35,868 --> 00:35:37,400
they would make a doll
out of a hooker?

688
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,902
Why'd they do that?

689
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:41,238
- Seriously? She's a hooker?
- -Yeah.

690
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,539
Then why is she
dressed like that

691
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,541
going to Tiffany's
for breakfast?

692
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:47,844
Think about what
you're seeing on screen.

693
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:50,814
The sun is coming up...

694
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:54,518
A beautiful girl,
in evening dress,

695
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,853
is getting out of cab.

696
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:58,889
Why? What is she doing

697
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:01,591
in an evening dress
at that hour?

698
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:04,327
Is she going out
to a party at sunrise?

699
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,696
Probably not. More likely,

700
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:09,799
she's coming home
from a party at sunrise.

701
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,701
-And then the next--
-this is not a good examp--

702
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:15,372
-and the next morning...
-Oh! So she... oh!

703
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:17,307
So she hooked up
with a rich guy,

704
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,709
-and she wants that guy--
-no. Well, not exactly.

705
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,211
Then what's up
with her outfit?

706
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:23,380
She wants extra cash
on the side,

707
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:25,382
so she's always
hooking up with men, right?

708
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:26,750
Well, yeah, I mean--

709
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,885
she was... a gal

710
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:31,788
who did take money
for entertaining guys,

711
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,790
it didn't--it didn't
specifically say

712
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:37,794
it became a sexual
situation or not. But, uh...

713
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:40,564
I don't think,
in the film,

714
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:42,365
you look at her as
an out-and-out hooker.

715
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,502
She's got too many
other elements.

716
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:47,571
You love her kookiness.

717
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:49,773
"Kook" was one of the words--
it was kind of a code word.

718
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,908
It was a-- it was a euphemism

719
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:55,245
to, um, comfort
nervous audiences

720
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:59,449
who knew a little bit about
what capote's novel was about,

721
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:01,685
and get them to feel,
sort of, more comfortable

722
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:03,987
with the idea that
they were seeing

723
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:06,556
a friendly movie,
a safe movie.

724
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,993
It may not have been
capote's original concept,

725
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:12,495
then I guess that
was a studio decision

726
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:16,233
for what they wanted
Holly golightly to be like.

727
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,702
Marilyn is closer

728
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:20,937
to the Holly golightly
in the novel.

729
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,872
So, on a certain level,

730
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:27,377
it makes sense that Truman
would want her.

731
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:29,613
Man, you guys-- you guys
are lucky that we just woke up.

732
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:32,616
-We're really raw
-yeah, we're really raw.

733
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,452
Can we--can we talk about

734
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:36,753
the song,
"breakfast at Tiffany's"?

735
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,388
Sure, go ahead.

736
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,790
But we were out in montauk
a couple years ago,

737
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,426
we were deejaying
our friend's wedding,

738
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,795
and we found ourselves
on the beach

739
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:48,632
trying to start
a bonfire.

740
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:51,301
And, uh...
Before we knew it,

741
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:54,304
we were joined by a bunch
of Ukrainian or...

742
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:56,640
-Eastern European, Ukrainian
-eastern--eastern, yeah.

743
00:37:56,642 --> 00:38:00,644
Like, really good-looking,
eastern European teenagers

744
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:02,979
because that's who works
in montauk for the summer.

745
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,848
And suddenly, one of them,
the young boy,

746
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,583
-breaks out a guitar--
-yeah.

747
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:08,652
And starts singing
acoustically

748
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:12,722
"breakfast at Tiffany's"
with a heavy Ukrainian accent...

749
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:15,325
In a slow jam,
it was amazing.

750
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:18,662
In this very broken
sort of English, um--

751
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,764
which made it
kind of better, somehow--

752
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:24,067
he's singing it
and everyone's singing along.

753
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:25,802
And I'm looking at them
and I'm like,

754
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,737
"you guys are 16,
and 17, and 18.

755
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,606
First of all,
you're way too young

756
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:32,509
-to know this song--
-also, they're ukranian.

757
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:36,012
-Yeah, like, how did you--
-they were communist
a few years ago,

758
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:38,348
and now they're singing
a capitalist song

759
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,016
about breakfast at Tiffany's.

760
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:43,353
I thought if I could
get that phrase,

761
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:45,689
"breakfast at Tiffany's,"
into a song

762
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:47,590
that people might like it.

763
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:51,027
It sounds great,
but you can't just say...

764
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:55,465
You know?
It's a weird song.

765
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:58,034
"And I said, what about
'breakfast at Tiffany's?'

766
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:00,670
she said, I think
i remember the film

767
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:04,741
and, as I recall, I think
we both kinda liked it.

768
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:08,445
Well, then, I guess that's
the one thing we've got."

769
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:10,780
Almost nothing poetic
about it.

770
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:14,384
It's the inflections.

771
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:15,919
Yeah. Yeah.

772
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,419
What's the next verse?

773
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:52,722
I have had people
who I went out with

774
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,525
swear up and down,
"oh, no, this is about me

775
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:56,760
because we watched
that movie."

776
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:58,161
I'm like, "no, we didn't."

777
00:39:58,163 --> 00:39:59,629
And so all these people think

778
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:00,964
that it's somehow
about them

779
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:02,799
and it's completely
fabricated.

780
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:11,641
The size of the diamond

781
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:12,976
or the quality
of the diamond?

782
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:14,644
The quality.

783
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,980
- Scarlett?
-Maybe the size.

784
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:19,983
No, I think the size--
i mean, what if it's like

785
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:22,886
a really ugly diamond,
and it's, like, so big

786
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:25,088
-that you just
can't stand it?
-Then you return it.

787
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,500
I think we should
stop here for a minute.

788
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,738
Maybe we should go
in there and find you

789
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,507
the most beautiful ring
that they have.

790
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,478
- All righty!

791
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,079
From that moment on,

792
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,848
Charlotte would tell everyone

793
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,616
that right in front
of Tiffany's,

794
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:29,486
out of nowhere
Trey popped the question

795
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:31,855
and she said, "all righty."

796
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:37,594
The engagement ring
as we know it

797
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:39,629
was introduced
by Tiffany himself.

798
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:41,664
Charles Tiffany
created a ring

799
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,933
that was more brilliant
than all others.

800
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:45,735
It was a beautiful ring

801
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:48,271
where the stone was lifted
up off the band

802
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:51,207
and held up so that
the light could scintillate.

803
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:53,243
This is the one
you see in cartoons.

804
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:54,911
I got a surprise
for Betty.

805
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:57,213
Get a load of this.

806
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:58,648
Wow!

807
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:02,886
Ooh-woo-woo-woo-woo,
what a sparkler.

808
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:04,654
I remember when
we first got engaged,

809
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:06,890
walking in there
and being so shocked
at the prices.

810
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:09,058
I said, "we gotta look
somewhere else."

811
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,060
- Is that right?
-Yes.

812
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:13,763
I think I was 20-- 24,
25-years-old at the time.

813
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:15,532
I couldn't quite
afford Tiffany's, so--

814
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:16,699
really? You're a Mara.

815
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,101
I--yeah, but...

816
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:20,036
I was a struggling
young lawyer at the time.

817
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,838
I--i think it
was some place

818
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,640
- on 47th street at the time.
- -47th street?

819
00:42:23,642 --> 00:42:25,675
- Yeah, yeah.
- -That'll get you.

820
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:27,777
Yes, yes.

821
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,712
The whole engagement thing
at Tiffany's

822
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,581
- is just a story in itself.
- -What do you mean?

823
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,583
It's a mystery.
I just see people there

824
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:35,618
and kids
and grownups, like--

825
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,221
- does anyone ever buy
an engagement ring there?

826
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:42,759
No, actually, today we have
a lot of self-purchasers.

827
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:45,862
And so, the larger,
the purer,

828
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:47,797
the rarer, the better.

829
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,699
They all want picassos,
but on their fingers.

830
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:03,279
Um, here I have...

831
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,217
I only have one--
actually, I have about

832
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:10,887
two and a half million
dollars right here,
2.5 million.

833
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:12,288
It allows you
to get a ring

834
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,190
for her for every occasion.

835
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:16,192
So, one for every day.

836
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:17,794
This, actually,
is very reasonable.

837
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:18,995
$306,000.

838
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,798
One for dinner--

839
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,969
this is a Tiffany lucida.

840
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:29,105
This is a 5-carat,
it's a d-20 flawless.

841
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,140
And one for the gala--

842
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:33,176
and this also is 5-carats.

843
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:36,079
So Tiffany's setting
the 5-carats at d, vvs1

844
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:37,981
and it's $923,000.

845
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:40,116
Still a bargain,
just sub-one million.

846
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,785
By the way,
we do accept cash.

847
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:45,788
Think that most people there
all aspire to have that,

848
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,156
and then girls try it on,

849
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:48,858
but I would think
it's disappointing,

850
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,660
'cause then I don't know
if they actually buy it.

851
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:52,895
And then they will
have to walk down 15 blocks

852
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:55,264
to go get
a copy of the...

853
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:57,033
--Ring.

854
00:43:57,035 --> 00:43:58,668
It always goes like this--

855
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:04,007
"oh, my cousin knows
someone on 47th street."

856
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:05,008
Did you get a blue box

857
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,843
when you got engaged?

858
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:08,678
- I didn't.
- -You didn't?

859
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,281
No, and I asked why not.

860
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:13,950
-But, you know, this is-- -
director] At that moment?

861
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:16,019
-Listen--no, no.
-Before he even asked you?

862
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:19,022
I didn't. I didn't,
but we were very young

863
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:21,824
and he was a waiter, and...

864
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,259
You know, I don't think
blue boxes really came

865
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:27,063
a lot very often
at that time-- I was, like, 22.

866
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:29,899
If we ever did get married
which, we don't believe in
marriage,

867
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:34,704
-it's a great institution.
-Yeah, but who wants to be
part of an institution?

868
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:37,373
- Tiffany. Right here.
- -Is that right?

869
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,375
- So then let me ask you this.
-My wedding ring.

870
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:41,044
So then, obviously,
you know that

871
00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:43,746
-they put out
this gay ad, right?
-No.

872
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:45,081
The famed Tiffany and company

873
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,383
thinking outside
of the little blue box tonight.

874
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:49,318
Check out this new ad
for engagement rings

875
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,454
featuring a real-life
gay couple.

876
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:53,056
It's going viral tonight.

877
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:55,892
Tiffany says, "it's part
of a modern approach

878
00:44:55,894 --> 00:44:57,126
to love and romance."

879
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,728
Oh, how great.

880
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,063
Now, why is that great?

881
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:02,065
Well, because
it's about time.

882
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:04,267
A spokesman for Tiffany's
said that everyone,

883
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:06,402
whether they are
gay or straight,
should have the right

884
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:10,073
- to grossly overpay
for jewelry.

885
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:11,841
It's a right we all have.

886
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:13,076
Well, yeah,
but they're also

887
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:14,477
supporting
their bottom line.

888
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:17,880
They realize there is
this whole new category

889
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,917
of people
who can get married.

890
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:24,253
They wanna see those people
wearing Tiffany rings.

891
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:25,955
'Cause whenever you get
a Tiffany ring,

892
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:27,457
you, like, "know"
it's from Tiffany's.

893
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:29,258
- How do you know?
-I mean, 'cause--

894
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,428
first of all, the style
and the color of the box.

895
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,263
But even if you didn't
have the box,

896
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:36,099
just something
in the diamond--

897
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:38,334
they're really white,
they're really beautiful.

898
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:40,937
I think that if you
get it from, like--

899
00:45:40,939 --> 00:45:43,973
um, other jewelry brands--
see, I don't know that many.

900
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:46,008
'Cause I know Tiffany,
that's it.

901
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,344
And the more he spends...
What does that mean?

902
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:50,279
The more he loves you.

903
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:52,281
- Or the more he's rich.
- -Do you believe that?

904
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:55,118
-Well, the more he spends--
-the more he wants
to win you over.

905
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,787
The more he wants
to win you over.

906
00:45:57,789 --> 00:45:59,455
So I was first introduced
to Tiffany and company

907
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:00,957
when I was in
the eighth grade.

908
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,959
My Nana took me to pick out

909
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:04,293
my first piece of Tiffany's

910
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:06,496
and from there on,
i became obsessed.

911
00:46:06,498 --> 00:46:09,799
Uh, then I met
my now-husband

912
00:46:09,801 --> 00:46:12,935
and he proposed to me
at the Tiffany and company
in Boston.

913
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,071
So we were watching
"sweet home Alabama" one night

914
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:16,405
when we first
started dating.

915
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:18,908
And I just,
offhanded comment, said,

916
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,877
"that would be
the most magical,

917
00:46:20,879 --> 00:46:22,145
amazing proposal."

918
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:24,347
And he somehow remembered.

919
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:27,216
And so, from there,
i decided to follow the theme.

920
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:30,253
And we did a Tiffany
and company-themed wedding,

921
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:33,222
I did a Tiffany
and company-themed
bridal shower,

922
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:35,158
bachelorette party.

923
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,993
I'm pretty sure,
when I have children,

924
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:39,829
I'll probably do a Tiffany
and company-themed baby shower.

925
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:42,331
Thanks, now people
are gonna think I'm crazy.

926
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:45,434
They're gonna, like, take me
to Tiffany-rehab after this.

927
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:47,837
When I first wrote
"sweet home Alabama,"

928
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,372
I wrote a normal scene
where a guy

929
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:51,174
just, uh, proposed
to his girlfriend.

930
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:53,109
And that, I think,
was a very private moment.

931
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:55,578
So, wrote the movie,
turned it into the studio.

932
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,313
The studio said,
"we love the script,

933
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:00,116
but we think you could
do better with the proposal."

934
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:04,053
Can we come up with something
just a little more dazzling

935
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:06,856
because the Patrick dempsey
character was supposed

936
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:08,424
to be this kind of
really cool guy.

937
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:11,027
And he was the, you know,
"the most eligible bachelor"

938
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:13,095
dating Reese Witherspoon's
character.

939
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:14,864
So, I went home that night

940
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:16,966
and my wife said, "so how did
it go at the studio?"

941
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:19,268
And I said, "well,
it's all really good

942
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,470
but they now want me
to come up with

943
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:24,941
the best, you know, proposal
that's ever been on film."

944
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:27,376
So we started throwing ideas
around at the dinner table,

945
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:30,046
and she said, "well, you know,
i was proposed to once

946
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:32,315
at Tiffany's."

947
00:47:32,317 --> 00:47:34,550
And I was like,
"wait, what?"

948
00:47:34,552 --> 00:47:36,552
And so I found out
that night that my wife

949
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:39,088
had been proposed to
about five times.

950
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,990
- What?
-And, um...

951
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:43,226
So I was like, "huh."

952
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:45,328
So I say, "well,
so, what happened?
You mean he walked you--"

953
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:48,397
and then she said, "well,
he walked me into Tiffany's,

954
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:50,900
and he said 'pick one.'"

955
00:47:50,902 --> 00:47:53,236
and I was like,
"why didn't you say yes?"

956
00:47:53,238 --> 00:47:56,072
Andrew, are you on
some sort of medication?

957
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:58,574
What's going on?
Where are we?

958
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:22,398
Oh, my god.

959
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,433
Oh--oh, my god.

960
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:33,009
Oh, my god.

961
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:34,277
I think the scene
in Tiffany's

962
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:35,678
is one of my most
recognized scenes.

963
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,047
I mean, that's why my wall
is Tiffany blue.

964
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:40,616
I mean, I literally--when
i was moving into this office

965
00:48:40,618 --> 00:48:43,452
and my, you know, the guy
who was decorating it.

966
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:46,355
I just said,
"there's gotta be some sorta
Tiffany color in here."

967
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:49,125
Has to be a tip of a hat
to a very successful movie

968
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:50,526
and a very successful scene.

969
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:52,528
Yes.

970
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,497
Yes! Yes!

971
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:56,232
Yes!

972
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,305
Pick one.

973
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:04,273
Come on, come on.

974
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:15,184
I actually went
to bora bora with my wife

975
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:17,186
as sort of
a second honeymoon,

976
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:20,389
and we ran in--you know,
we ran into honeymooners,

977
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:22,558
and as we started talking
and getting to know them,

978
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,026
they found out
i was a film director

979
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:25,328
and when I said
"sweet home Alabama,"

980
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:26,996
they were like,
"oh, my god! Tiffany's!"

981
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,503
Well, I needed
to use jewelry

982
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:37,006
in the "ocean's" trilogy,

983
00:49:37,008 --> 00:49:41,077
and I had to dress
some of the most beautiful
women in the world

984
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:43,179
with some of the handsomest
men in the world.

985
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:45,514
So I figured I'd better go
to the most important

986
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:47,616
jewelry company
in the world.

987
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:51,120
When a person puts on
a great piece of jewelry,

988
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:53,689
and a Tiffany jewelry,
they feel a certain way.

989
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:55,358
It gives them a certain
joie de vivre

990
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,693
that they don't--might not
have without that.

991
00:49:57,695 --> 00:50:00,029
I mean, Julia has it
either way.

992
00:50:00,031 --> 00:50:02,031
But it makes her feel good,

993
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:04,700
makes her feel like she has
something important on,
which she does.

994
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:08,170
With movie stars
like Julia Roberts
and so on and so forth,

995
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:11,574
I don't say, "wear this,
and wear it now!"

996
00:50:11,576 --> 00:50:13,242
I sit down with them
and I say,

997
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:14,777
"this is jewelry
from Tiffany's.

998
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:17,680
Take a look at it and see
what catches your eye,

999
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,382
see what you enjoy."

1000
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:21,250
And then they find things
that they like

1001
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:23,085
and they try 'em on.

1002
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:25,054
And they try 'em on
with the dress they're wearing

1003
00:50:25,056 --> 00:50:26,455
and they try 'em on again
and again and again.

1004
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:28,724
And they change their mind
four, five times.

1005
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:32,661
So... and then they finally
settle in on a piece.

1006
00:50:32,663 --> 00:50:34,730
You are up to something,
Danny. What?

1007
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:36,399
And don't say
"you came here for me."

1008
00:50:36,401 --> 00:50:37,733
You're pulling a job,
aren't you?

1009
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:40,403
Well, know this.
No matter what it is,

1010
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:42,738
you won't win me back.

1011
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,207
Tess, I just came
to say goodbye.

1012
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,276
I got you something,
and, um--

1013
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:48,744
-aw, it's a Tiffany box.
-Thank you, yeah.

1014
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:51,414
I wasn't--i wasn't invited
to the wedding.

1015
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:53,749
--No.

1016
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:55,418
Yeah, we don't know
each other.

1017
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,420
Not well enough for you
to come to the wedding, no.

1018
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:59,422
--It would've been really odd.

1019
00:50:59,424 --> 00:51:01,824
I know I don't know you,
but I just wanted

1020
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:04,093
-to give you something.
-Okay. Well, thank you.

1021
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:06,429
-You can share that
with your wife.
-Can I open it now?

1022
00:51:06,431 --> 00:51:08,097
Yeah, go ahead.
Please, please do.

1023
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:10,099
Is it, uh...

1024
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:13,436
Wow, it's--wow, it is
really a Tiffany thing--

1025
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:15,771
oh, come on.
I'm on network, now, man.

1026
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:17,273
Of course it's gonna
be a Tiffany.

1027
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:19,442
This isn't
comedy central swag.

1028
00:51:19,444 --> 00:51:21,110
- It's engraved.
-It's engraved.

1029
00:51:21,112 --> 00:51:22,211
What does it say?

1030
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:23,579
It says, "i don't know you."

1031
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,290
"Someone will move away,

1032
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:35,825
someone will come home,

1033
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:38,494
someone will
finally graduate..."

1034
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,301
What we're doing
when we do this

1035
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:48,871
is to explain Tiffany's
purpose in the world

1036
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:51,107
to, maybe,
a younger generation

1037
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:52,575
that is not familiar with it.

1038
00:51:52,577 --> 00:51:54,477
It's a little lost
on my generation

1039
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:57,513
'cause I think
it's a bit... tired.

1040
00:51:57,515 --> 00:52:01,617
And there's a lot
of psychological components
to Tiffany's.

1041
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,319
We touch on
the products we sell,

1042
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:07,723
like engagement rings
and gifts for special occasions,

1043
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:09,725
but there's
no direct selling here.

1044
00:52:09,727 --> 00:52:11,393
It's just an attitude.

1045
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:14,730
It's a feeling
about our customer,

1046
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:16,632
and who we are.

1047
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:18,634
I think it is
a little bit of a brainwash.

1048
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:22,771
A lot of the ads
are white families.

1049
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:26,876
It's--it's a little bit
of a 1950s kind of feel to it.

1050
00:52:26,878 --> 00:52:29,578
We want to speak
to our customer

1051
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,848
as a human being,
as someone who has a family.

1052
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:35,351
Maybe have children,
maybe wants to get married.

1053
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:38,621
It stretches true love
so much,

1054
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:40,689
it's such an unrealistic
true love.

1055
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:43,192
Which also, I think,
gives us

1056
00:52:43,194 --> 00:52:44,860
a little bit
of a "yuck."

1057
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,757
I was about 11 years old

1058
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:50,993
and I saw the ad
in the "New York times,"

1059
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:52,494
where Tiffany's ads
have always been,

1060
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:53,996
I saw an ad for a ring.

1061
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:57,666
And the ring was--
cost $176,000.

1062
00:53:57,668 --> 00:53:59,001
I remember thinking
that was just

1063
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:00,936
an inconceivable amount
of money.

1064
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:02,871
I was the son
of two writers,

1065
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:05,307
we were not rich by any stretch
of the imagination,

1066
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:06,809
and that just
seemed incredible.

1067
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:09,445
And so I wrote this letter.
And, on the one hand,

1068
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:11,280
it was... I could
do the math, and so

1069
00:54:11,282 --> 00:54:13,482
it was a slightly
snarky letter, I suppose,

1070
00:54:13,484 --> 00:54:14,817
but at the same time
i was 11 years old.

1071
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:17,386
I remember thinking,
"well, you never know."

1072
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:18,420
"Dear Tiffany's...

1073
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,635
"Sincerely, David joblanski."

1074
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:35,537
"Dear David..."

1075
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:57,393
Well, there's one man
who agrees with that.

1076
00:54:57,395 --> 00:54:58,727
His name
is Walter hoving

1077
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:01,497
and he is the president,
chief executive officer

1078
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:03,832
of Tiffany, a store
of which you may have heard.

1079
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:05,768
-And here's tom brokaw.
-Thank you, gene.

1080
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,770
Walter hoving has been
in retailing

1081
00:55:07,772 --> 00:55:09,772
for 60 years now,
and he has been affiliated

1082
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:11,940
with places as different
as Montgomery ward's

1083
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:14,343
and bonwitt and teller
and lord and Taylor.

1084
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:16,912
And for the past 23 years,
he's been the chairman
of Tiffany's.

1085
00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:18,547
Last week he placed an ad

1086
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:20,349
in a newspaper, it said...

1087
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:28,457
Mr. hoving, why aren't you
open on Sundays?

1088
00:55:28,459 --> 00:55:30,592
After all, this is
the biggest time of the year,
i would suspect,

1089
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:32,861
-for Tiffany's.
-We think our customers
need a rest.

1090
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,364
So we keep closed
on Sundays.

1091
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:37,866
Mr. hoving, you have
on sale at Tiffany's

1092
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:40,869
an emerald necklace
that is worth $1,700,000

1093
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:43,706
and you have a diamond
that is worth $7 million,

1094
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,040
- I think, all together.
-That's right.

1095
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:46,875
What if someone
were passing through town,

1096
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:49,745
and decided that they wanted
to buy one of those two items,

1097
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:51,547
but they were only
available on Sunday.

1098
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:53,716
Would you open the store to sell
them one of those two items?

1099
00:55:53,718 --> 00:55:56,885
- No, we would not. No.
-You'd pass
on that sale?

1100
00:55:56,887 --> 00:55:58,721
- That's right.
- -Walter hoving,

1101
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:00,556
outspoken chairman
of the board
of a little store,

1102
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:02,124
as we like to say on
the corner here in New York,

1103
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:03,592
called Tiffany's.

1104
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,586
Is it heavy
when you pick it up?

1105
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:32,588
Uh, not really, no.
But I remember

1106
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,157
being handed the trophy
and remember thinking

1107
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:37,760
"please don't drop it,
you're on national television.

1108
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:39,762
You got millions
of people watching."

1109
00:56:39,764 --> 00:56:41,096
So I think I held it
with two hands,

1110
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:42,564
but it's really
not very heavy at all.

1111
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:43,966
But it is--it is beautiful

1112
00:56:43,968 --> 00:56:46,935
and, uh, we sure like
the four that we have

1113
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:50,572
and that's your goal.
And it's a tough goal
to achieve

1114
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:53,142
'cause there are 31
other clubs out there
trying to do the same thing.

1115
00:56:53,144 --> 00:56:54,977
By the time
the trophy is coming out,

1116
00:56:54,979 --> 00:56:57,646
usually we're, like,
divvying up, you know,

1117
00:56:57,648 --> 00:56:59,782
our winnings or our losses

1118
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:01,950
and not paying
a lot of attention

1119
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:04,953
to that super bowl trophy,
but I bet the players are.

1120
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:07,623
And I bet when those players
get that trophy,

1121
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:09,124
and their wives
or their girlfriends

1122
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:11,126
are standing
just off the side,

1123
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:12,861
they say,
"i want my trophy."

1124
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:24,032
George steinbrenner bought
the Yankees in 1973.

1125
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:27,703
At that time, I think
the top hat logo
was more in use.

1126
00:58:27,705 --> 00:58:30,038
It adorned
every team publication,

1127
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,874
it was more commonly used.

1128
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:35,143
He was more attracted
to the interlocking "n-y."

1129
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:37,546
He thought there was something
very classy about it.

1130
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:40,048
So, almost immediately from
the time he owned the team,

1131
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,150
that was the logo of choice.

1132
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:45,721
Tiffany had designed
that interlocking "n-y"

1133
00:58:45,723 --> 00:58:49,291
on a police medal
that was given in 1877

1134
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:52,227
to a wounded New York City
police officer.

1135
00:58:52,229 --> 00:58:54,062
One of the Yankees'
two owners

1136
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:56,732
in their first decade
of existence

1137
00:58:56,734 --> 00:58:58,567
was William devery,

1138
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:01,937
who had been chief of police
of New York City.

1139
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:06,041
William devery probably kept
that "n-y" design

1140
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,744
in some form
of circulation

1141
00:59:08,746 --> 00:59:11,914
and he was still half-owner
of the team in 1909

1142
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:14,016
when it first appeared
on the yankee uniform.

1143
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:04,299
You may get another
announcement in a second.
Yeah, shoot--say it again?

1144
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:06,969
When the clock
was first installed,
why was Tiffany chosen?

1145
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:08,770
Got it. Okay.

1146
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,772
Here in
grand central terminal,

1147
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,941
many people believe
and testify

1148
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:17,679
that our magnificent October,
starlit, zodiac ceiling--

1149
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:20,882
which happens to be made
of Tiffany blue

1150
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:22,317
to represent the sky--

1151
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,319
that there may
be a correlation.

1152
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:26,955
It's one we're perfectly
willing to accept.

1153
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,992
It's all surrounded
by the world's largest,

1154
01:00:29,994 --> 01:00:33,161
most magnificent piece
of Tiffany glass,

1155
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:36,832
the clock, that just
identifies this terminal.

1156
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,176
There's been a billion movies
made about New York.

1157
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:52,147
Every possible building,
statue, has been in a movie.

1158
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:53,882
This has never been
in a movie.

1159
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:55,250
That's how I convinced
Marty to do it.

1160
01:00:55,252 --> 01:00:57,853
It's so beautiful,
that clock,

1161
01:00:57,855 --> 01:01:00,322
that from the back
that clock is beautiful.

1162
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,124
And people, you know,
don't really see

1163
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:03,358
the clock
that I came out of

1164
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,761
because you can only see it

1165
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:07,863
if you're going
up park Avenue.

1166
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:11,133
Our Tiffany clock,
all the original parts
are still there.

1167
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:13,035
The original motors,
the original gears.

1168
01:01:13,037 --> 01:01:15,704
With all these pieces
a hundred years old,

1169
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:18,206
it's accurate
to within one second

1170
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:21,977
every 1,400,000 years.

1171
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:39,261
Well, I can say
that I was thrilled

1172
01:01:39,263 --> 01:01:42,931
to read the biography
of Steve Jobs

1173
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:45,400
because I had not realized
that Steve Jobs

1174
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:49,738
had appreciated the design
and the work of Louis Tiffany.

1175
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,339
One of the illustrations
in that book,

1176
01:01:51,341 --> 01:01:54,076
it depicted Steve Jobs
sitting on the floor

1177
01:01:54,078 --> 01:01:56,411
in a virtually empty
room in his home

1178
01:01:56,413 --> 01:01:59,414
where the only object
was a floor lamp.

1179
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:00,916
What the book
went on to say

1180
01:02:00,918 --> 01:02:02,851
is that he couldn't
furnish his home

1181
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:05,787
because he couldn't find
anything that met his standards

1182
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:07,222
and there you have
a Tiffany lamp.

1183
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,001
He appreciated
the beauty in it
and the cleanl--

1184
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:21,436
what he was
trying to say.

1185
01:02:21,438 --> 01:02:24,506
Well, Tiffany was about
beauty, and he was too.

1186
01:02:24,508 --> 01:02:27,776
It was about design-- and
perfect design.

1187
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:29,377
When you think
of the magnolia,

1188
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:31,279
you harken back
to nature.

1189
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:32,447
And then,
even if you go further,

1190
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:34,116
you think
of Japanese culture

1191
01:02:34,118 --> 01:02:36,118
because Tiffany
travelled tremendously

1192
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,786
throughout the world
and he brought

1193
01:02:37,788 --> 01:02:40,122
many of his influences
from traveling

1194
01:02:40,124 --> 01:02:42,124
into his design aesthetic.

1195
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:45,026
So you can relate to it
in very different ways.

1196
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:47,796
One of his quotes was
"nature is always beautiful."

1197
01:02:47,798 --> 01:02:50,031
I think that
was very inspirational.

1198
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:52,367
Color was
so important to him.

1199
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:54,870
He was--he considered
himself a colorist

1200
01:02:54,872 --> 01:02:58,507
and it comes through
in everything that was made.

1201
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,255
By the time that
Charles Lewis Tiffany dies,

1202
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:16,825
Louis has really mastered
all of these different forms.

1203
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:18,160
And I think that
the jewelry really

1204
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:20,328
is such a continuation
of his aesthetic.

1205
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,831
Again, the emphasis on color.

1206
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:24,833
The emphasis on nature.

1207
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:28,003
Louis went on to do
very much the same
as his father did,

1208
01:03:28,005 --> 01:03:29,871
which was to create a brand

1209
01:03:29,873 --> 01:03:34,009
and to open this
incredible luxury, sort of,
retail emporium,

1210
01:03:34,011 --> 01:03:37,345
and very much followed
in his father's footsteps.

1211
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,559
The sidewalks
along fifth Avenue

1212
01:03:50,561 --> 01:03:52,561
are always crowded
with shoppers.

1213
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:58,200
Fran and Sally
did some shopping, too.

1214
01:03:58,202 --> 01:04:00,368
They were just
window shopping here, though.

1215
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:04,206
Yes, this is "the" Tiffany's,

1216
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:07,142
the world famous
jewelry store.

1217
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:10,879
Well, this was, of course,
the summer of 1945.

1218
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:14,216
And we were looking
for a summer job.

1219
01:04:14,218 --> 01:04:19,221
We had been turned down by
most of the department stores

1220
01:04:19,223 --> 01:04:22,390
and when we went
up the Avenue,

1221
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:26,228
suddenly-- there
we saw Tiffany's.

1222
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,230
We loved to be
on the main floor

1223
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:31,066
because we wanted
to watch the door

1224
01:04:31,068 --> 01:04:32,634
for all the celebrities.

1225
01:04:32,636 --> 01:04:36,438
That was a dazzling moment,
to see Judy garland.

1226
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:40,909
When she walked in
with her new husband,

1227
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:45,247
she looked so happy,
and to hear that famous laugh

1228
01:04:45,249 --> 01:04:47,082
ring through the store...

1229
01:04:47,084 --> 01:04:49,084
Who knows what
she was laughing about?

1230
01:04:49,086 --> 01:04:53,922
But what she purchased
as a gift from mgm

1231
01:04:53,924 --> 01:04:58,026
were emeralds, which made me
think of "the wizard of oz."

1232
01:04:58,028 --> 01:05:00,428
They said that was
her wedding present,

1233
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:05,000
she could choose anything
she wanted at Tiffany.

1234
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:10,432
This watch is incredible.

1235
01:06:10,434 --> 01:06:12,167
This is, um, quite amazing.

1236
01:06:12,169 --> 01:06:13,335
This is from
our archive.

1237
01:06:13,337 --> 01:06:15,503
This is fdr's last watch.

1238
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:17,672
Now, we've made a lot
of watches for presidents

1239
01:06:17,674 --> 01:06:20,542
and it's surprisingly small,
i have to say.

1240
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:22,043
When you wear it,

1241
01:06:22,045 --> 01:06:24,245
it literally sends
shivers down your spine.

1242
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:26,114
You can see here
how much he loved it

1243
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:28,450
and how much he wore it
'cause all of the stitching

1244
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:30,585
on this side
is completely worn off.

1245
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:32,587
We have this amazing history
of watch making.

1246
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:35,056
I found it
extremely inspiring.

1247
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:26,501
I think my first blue box

1248
01:08:26,503 --> 01:08:29,137
was around when
i was 12 or 13.

1249
01:08:29,139 --> 01:08:30,805
And I remember being
rather disappointed

1250
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:33,641
on my 16th birthday when
there were multiple blue boxes.

1251
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:36,311
And there was a large one,
and I was really excited

1252
01:08:36,313 --> 01:08:38,646
to open it up
and see what was inside.

1253
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:40,615
It was, of course,
the first box that I went for.

1254
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:41,816
And when I started
opening it up,

1255
01:08:41,818 --> 01:08:43,852
inside I found
an etiquette book.

1256
01:08:43,854 --> 01:08:45,487
I think my
first exposure was

1257
01:08:45,489 --> 01:08:49,124
the Tiffany's etiquette book
for teenagers.

1258
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:51,126
I came to the U.S.
when I was eight or nine,

1259
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:54,429
so we weren't so well-schooled
on American etiquette.

1260
01:08:54,431 --> 01:08:56,531
They were like,
"this is a good book
to learn from."

1261
01:08:56,533 --> 01:08:57,632
Beyond chopsticks.

1262
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,634
My first memory of Tiffany's

1263
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,703
is... they have
an etiquette guide
for teenagers--

1264
01:09:01,705 --> 01:09:03,738
"Tiffany's table manners
for teenagers."

1265
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,340
I remember the Christmas.

1266
01:09:05,342 --> 01:09:07,509
I was probably 13,
maybe 14 at the time.

1267
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:09,844
An etiquette book isn't
what every teenager wants
for Christmas.

1268
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:12,847
I think it's such an iconic,
respected American brand

1269
01:09:12,849 --> 01:09:14,916
so, I think parents
might think

1270
01:09:14,918 --> 01:09:17,519
that's it's a great thing
to give to a young girl.

1271
01:09:17,521 --> 01:09:20,855
-So that was a little bit
of a disappointment, but-- -
director] The etiquette book?

1272
01:09:20,857 --> 01:09:22,524
Yes,
the Tiffany etiquette book.

1273
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:24,792
But apparently, I guess
i learned a few things from it.

1274
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:26,528
And it wasn't until
i was older

1275
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:29,364
when I realized that
I'm gonna move to New York,

1276
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:30,865
if I'm gonna make it
in the big city,

1277
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:33,368
I should know
which one is a salad fork,

1278
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:35,203
which one
is the soup spoon.

1279
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:38,306
And so, I found myself,
sneakily, stealthily,

1280
01:09:38,308 --> 01:09:40,808
looking for that book
and reading a few chapters.

1281
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:43,578
And I actually just
bought it for my son,

1282
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,580
and he's nine,
and we were at breakfast

1283
01:09:45,582 --> 01:09:47,248
and I gave it to him
and he looked at it.

1284
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,384
And he looked at me,
he goes,

1285
01:09:49,386 --> 01:09:51,719
"my name is not Tiffany
and I'm not a teenager.

1286
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:54,722
Here you go,
you can have it back."

1287
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:58,893
I was super lucky
that for one of my birthdays

1288
01:09:58,895 --> 01:10:02,530
my team literally
captured me, blindfolded me--

1289
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:05,400
they actually took me
on this surprise trip

1290
01:10:05,402 --> 01:10:07,268
and when I opened my eyes

1291
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:10,205
I was on the second floor
of this Tiffany's

1292
01:10:10,207 --> 01:10:12,874
and they had created this
wonderful breakfast for me.

1293
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:16,578
So I literally had
breakfast at Tiffany's.

1294
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:19,581
--Who--who else had
a birthday?

1295
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:21,749
I think Katie Couric
had her birthday there.

1296
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:24,285
-Did you know about that?
-Katie Couric? No, I don't.

1297
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:26,821
But I'm very happy to share
that experience with Katie.

1298
01:10:26,823 --> 01:10:28,823
Katie's a very jolly lady.

1299
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:31,559
They let glenda baily
have a party at Tiffany's?

1300
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:33,328
I thought
i was the only one.

1301
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:34,963
I was turning 50

1302
01:10:34,965 --> 01:10:39,267
and unlike a lot of people,
i love birthdays.

1303
01:10:39,269 --> 01:10:40,635
And I love parties.

1304
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,552
It was an inside job
basically,

1305
01:10:57,554 --> 01:11:00,355
my friend Carole
works at Tiffany.

1306
01:11:00,357 --> 01:11:03,591
I was trying to find
a really cool, fun,
different space.

1307
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:06,694
We had a cocktail party
on the first floor.

1308
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:08,596
We served tiffaninis,

1309
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:12,300
which looked
dangerously like,
um Ty-d-bol.

1310
01:11:12,302 --> 01:11:14,636
But they were delicious.
And strong.

1311
01:11:14,638 --> 01:11:17,372
I think it will probably
go down in history,

1312
01:11:17,374 --> 01:11:18,773
my personal history,

1313
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,642
as my best birthday ever.

1314
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:28,416
I am a scorpio,
just like Elsa peretti.

1315
01:11:28,418 --> 01:11:31,486
And Elsa peretti
of course designed
this beautiful necklace

1316
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:33,388
which was a present
from my team.

1317
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:35,657
And it reminds
everybody

1318
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:38,559
that the qualities a scorpio
is supposed to have.

1319
01:11:38,561 --> 01:11:40,595
And all I can tell you
is that Elsa

1320
01:11:40,597 --> 01:11:43,498
is one of the most
passionate, strong,

1321
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,301
and focused individuals

1322
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:48,436
I've ever had
the pleasure to meet.

1323
01:11:51,041 --> 01:11:55,410
On my wish list,
of course is the scorpio.

1324
01:11:55,412 --> 01:11:57,545
J'adore.
She's divine.

1325
01:11:57,547 --> 01:11:59,447
My first piece
i wanted

1326
01:11:59,449 --> 01:12:03,918
was the bone cuff
from Elsa peretti.

1327
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,789
Oh, everybody should have
a peretti Sterling cuff.

1328
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:09,824
I mean, I had client
in here earlier today

1329
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:13,027
who collects peretti
and was wearing a pair
of peretti earrings.

1330
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:15,530
And it's just like,
it's always good.

1331
01:12:15,532 --> 01:12:20,068
When Elsa started at Tiffany,
it was the mid 1970s.

1332
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:23,871
And Elsa peretti
was hot, you know?

1333
01:12:23,873 --> 01:12:26,908
I mean, she was part
of halston's entourage,

1334
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:28,476
she was a model.

1335
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:30,645
She had been
designing jewelry

1336
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:33,581
that was on the catwalks
with halston

1337
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:35,717
and giorgio di sant' Angelo.

1338
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:37,385
And the jewelry
was a hit.

1339
01:12:37,387 --> 01:12:39,821
I really like the design
of the Elsa peretti pieces.

1340
01:12:39,823 --> 01:12:42,857
So for my editorial work,
and also with fashion shows

1341
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,459
I've used it a lot

1342
01:12:44,461 --> 01:12:46,761
'cause it's some
of my favorite jewelry

1343
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:48,096
that exists.

1344
01:12:48,098 --> 01:12:50,131
Well, this is
the first piece of jewelry

1345
01:12:50,133 --> 01:12:52,700
that Elsa peretti
designed at Tiffany--

1346
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:56,704
one of the first pieces
but she really designed
it before she started.

1347
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:59,607
You know there's a necklace
that's like a bud base.

1348
01:12:59,609 --> 01:13:01,008
That an orchid
could fit in.

1349
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,610
She said
she designed it

1350
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:06,514
because when she saw
the girls in Capri

1351
01:13:06,516 --> 01:13:08,416
wearing flowers
in their hair,

1352
01:13:08,418 --> 01:13:10,918
she thought that was
the most beautiful thing
in the world.

1353
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,855
But she didn't want
her flower to die.

1354
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:17,692
So she made
a bottle pendant to put
the flower in.

1355
01:13:17,694 --> 01:13:19,660
And that's
what it's for.

1356
01:13:19,662 --> 01:13:22,130
But like, there's
sort of a suggestion

1357
01:13:22,132 --> 01:13:24,999
that you could also keep
your drugs in there.

1358
01:13:27,137 --> 01:13:29,470
I mean...

1359
01:13:29,472 --> 01:13:31,139
No, like, you know.

1360
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:32,840
It's cool.

1361
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,107
What she able to do

1362
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:08,609
in terms of communicating
her language

1363
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:11,012
and her aesthetic
through jewelry,

1364
01:14:11,014 --> 01:14:13,714
she certainly
paved the way

1365
01:14:13,716 --> 01:14:15,783
for people like myself

1366
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:18,486
and other jewelry
designers today.

1367
01:14:18,488 --> 01:14:21,022
And there's not a lot
of places that wanna

1368
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:24,792
bring other designers
in under their umbrella.

1369
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:27,862
Being a part of vogue
and being a part
of the c.F.D.A.

1370
01:14:27,864 --> 01:14:31,666
Is wonderful because
they really do foster
new designers

1371
01:14:31,668 --> 01:14:32,934
and help companies.

1372
01:14:32,936 --> 01:14:35,002
You know,
i can't even tell you

1373
01:14:35,004 --> 01:14:37,638
what the last year
has done for my business,
just being a part of it.

1374
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,840
When I won runner-up,

1375
01:14:38,842 --> 01:14:40,475
I got a really nice gift
from Tiffany

1376
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:41,876
and I was in heaven.

1377
01:14:41,878 --> 01:14:43,144
The idea of jewelry,

1378
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:46,247
and to succeed
as a jewelry designer,

1379
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:50,618
I think is something
that even clothing designers
have aspirations for.

1380
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:53,955
The year Monique pean won,
she was a runner-up winner

1381
01:14:53,957 --> 01:14:57,792
she won $100,000
and her choice of mentor.

1382
01:14:57,794 --> 01:14:59,694
Went into
Anna wintour's office

1383
01:14:59,696 --> 01:15:01,529
and she said if you could
have any mentor,

1384
01:15:01,531 --> 01:15:02,897
who would you choose?

1385
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:04,565
And I said, "you know
if I could have anyone,

1386
01:15:04,567 --> 01:15:06,534
I would love
to be able to work

1387
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:08,669
with Michael Kowalski,
the ceo of Tiffany."

1388
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,572
What intrigued me of course,
was her intense interest

1389
01:15:11,574 --> 01:15:13,674
in the materials
that she uses.

1390
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:16,110
And her commitment
to--to sustainability

1391
01:15:16,112 --> 01:15:18,012
not only
in terms of materials,

1392
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,614
but in terms of the folks

1393
01:15:19,616 --> 01:15:20,982
who provide those materials.

1394
01:15:20,984 --> 01:15:23,584
And I thought it was
a--a wonderful story,

1395
01:15:23,586 --> 01:15:25,853
and I think it's relevant
for luxury today.

1396
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:27,588
Rather than
taking from the earth,

1397
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:29,857
finding things
that you can reinvent,

1398
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,559
fossils are so incredible
because they're

1399
01:15:31,561 --> 01:15:33,661
almost like nature's
photographs.

1400
01:15:33,663 --> 01:15:35,930
And that they're able
to tell a story through time.

1401
01:15:35,932 --> 01:15:38,666
And I use a lot
of fossilized woolly mammoth

1402
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:40,101
and fossilized
dinosaur bone.

1403
01:15:40,103 --> 01:15:41,802
This is fossilized
woolly mammoth,

1404
01:15:41,804 --> 01:15:43,004
the cream parts

1405
01:15:43,006 --> 01:15:44,238
that have been
trapped in the ice

1406
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,741
over tens of thousands
of years.

1407
01:15:46,743 --> 01:15:49,777
And then in the center
is fossilized woolly mammoth

1408
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:51,112
the root of the tooth

1409
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:53,548
and the salt minerals
over 35,000 years

1410
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:55,249
changed the color
to these deep blues.

1411
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:57,852
And then in the middle
is fossilized dinosaur bone.

1412
01:15:57,854 --> 01:15:59,086
That's from
the Jurassic period

1413
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:01,088
and 150 million years old.

1414
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:03,090
In jewelry designing,

1415
01:16:03,092 --> 01:16:05,893
talented new artists like
Jean schlumberger

1416
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:07,328
originated labyrinth ideas,

1417
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,196
which are the despair
of manufacturers

1418
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:11,299
who serve the mass market.

1419
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:16,137
I love the, um...

1420
01:16:16,139 --> 01:16:17,705
One of my favorites
is the--shit.

1421
01:16:17,707 --> 01:16:18,940
I can--can never
pronounce him.

1422
01:16:18,942 --> 01:16:20,308
"Schlum--sumberger."

1423
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:22,343
- "Schlum-ber-Jay."
-Schlumberger. Mm-hmm.

1424
01:16:22,345 --> 01:16:23,744
Yup, make them Jewish.

1425
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:26,180
- "Schlum-burger."

1426
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:28,950
"Schlum-burger?"
Oh, my god. That's
so embarrassing.

1427
01:16:28,952 --> 01:16:31,218
- You corrected her, right?

1428
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:34,589
I mean, you got--
of course, the...

1429
01:16:34,591 --> 01:16:36,757
Oh, my god,
why am I thinking
of "Cho-ba-Jay"?

1430
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:38,659
"Show-ba-Jay."
I'm saying it wrong.

1431
01:16:38,661 --> 01:16:40,895
- Well, it's like--
-it's close.

1432
01:16:40,897 --> 01:16:43,698
- "Schlum-ber-Jay.
" -And they brought out the broach, and they said,

1433
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:44,799
"this is "schlum-ber-Jay."

1434
01:16:44,801 --> 01:16:46,233
Is that how it's pronounced?

1435
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:47,835
- Well, it's like--
-it's close.

1436
01:16:47,837 --> 01:16:49,637
- "Schlum-ber-Jay."
-Schlumberger.

1437
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:51,038
"Sean--schlumberger."

1438
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,174
The schlumberger--

1439
01:16:53,176 --> 01:16:55,076
these are heirlooms.

1440
01:16:55,078 --> 01:17:00,314
These are family heirlooms,
and they are from the 1940's.

1441
01:17:00,316 --> 01:17:01,916
They're early schlumberger.

1442
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:03,985
I love
the schlumberger pieces.

1443
01:17:03,987 --> 01:17:05,620
Whenever I go in
to the Tiffany store,

1444
01:17:05,622 --> 01:17:06,821
that's where I go and just

1445
01:17:06,823 --> 01:17:08,689
sort of
pet the cabinets and...

1446
01:17:08,691 --> 01:17:11,292
And drool.

1447
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:36,117
--The seahorse

1448
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:37,351
is one of the very first

1449
01:17:37,353 --> 01:17:39,253
schlumberger pieces
that I bought.

1450
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:42,323
He really was attracted
to themes in nature.

1451
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:43,858
What he's most known for

1452
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,393
are the schlumberger
enamel bracelets.

1453
01:17:45,395 --> 01:17:46,827
Jackie Kennedy
used to wear them

1454
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:47,828
all the time.

1455
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,363
And those are fantastic.

1456
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:53,167
I'm really a fan
of big, big, big pieces.

1457
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:56,037
This broach I'm sup--
I'm really partial to.

1458
01:17:56,039 --> 01:17:57,705
I used to read

1459
01:17:57,707 --> 01:17:59,407
Elizabeth Taylor,
my love affair with jewelry."

1460
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:01,108
It was
my very favorite piece

1461
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:02,743
in the book,
and I thought

1462
01:18:02,745 --> 01:18:04,078
I always wanted it,

1463
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,813
and then when this came up
for auction--

1464
01:18:05,815 --> 01:18:08,182
I think it went
for about $1 million.

1465
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,718
- Yes.
- $550,000 then, and selling.

1466
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,720
$550,000.

1467
01:18:12,722 --> 01:18:15,389
At $6,300,000 then.
Here we are...

1468
01:18:15,391 --> 01:18:18,059
Sold for you, sir.
$7,800,000.

1469
01:18:18,061 --> 01:18:22,263
--Thank you very much.

1470
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:23,798
I thought,
"well, I'm never gonna get

1471
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,132
the Elizabeth Taylor one."

1472
01:18:25,134 --> 01:18:28,836
And so, I got this
and I think it was...

1473
01:18:28,838 --> 01:18:31,272
Don't quote me.
Like $60,000 or $70,000.

1474
01:18:31,274 --> 01:18:32,440
But there's only
six of these.

1475
01:18:32,442 --> 01:18:34,041
This one was made
in the 80s.

1476
01:18:56,032 --> 01:18:58,299
The designs that we have,
we don't change.

1477
01:18:58,301 --> 01:18:59,366
We try and recreate.

1478
01:18:59,368 --> 01:19:01,001
Some designs
were never made.

1479
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:03,437
Some sketches
were only part-sketched.

1480
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:05,473
And sometimes
you have to guess.

1481
01:19:05,475 --> 01:19:07,341
But it's all in
what he left.

1482
01:19:07,343 --> 01:19:08,843
There's nothing

1483
01:19:08,845 --> 01:19:12,146
that's being adapted
or changed.

1484
01:19:12,148 --> 01:19:15,282
-Diamonds...
Are a girl's best friend.
-Are a girl's best friend,

1485
01:19:15,284 --> 01:19:17,952
and what better night
to sparkle than on Oscar's?

1486
01:19:17,954 --> 01:19:19,854
Thank goodness.

1487
01:19:19,856 --> 01:19:21,922
Thank goodness
for Tiffany and co.

1488
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:23,023
Look at this.

1489
01:19:23,025 --> 01:19:24,024
Look how gorgeous.

1490
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:25,426
To die.

1491
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:27,194
-And by the way--
-you can't take it--

1492
01:19:27,196 --> 01:19:29,263
-...this is one
of her favorite pieces.
-...From her.

1493
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,031
I know, well we brought that
after she was, uh--

1494
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:32,399
-yeah, she was--
-she went right to that

1495
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:33,868
and was
really drawn to that.

1496
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,302
Yeah, she'll be
very excited about that.

1497
01:19:35,304 --> 01:19:36,904
-So, we wanted to make-- -and so
am I.

1498
01:19:36,906 --> 01:19:38,506
Which we, of course,
are also partial to

1499
01:19:38,508 --> 01:19:41,208
because it's so close
to the Tiffany blue color.

1500
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,476
Oh, right, got it.

1501
01:19:42,478 --> 01:19:45,379
Jessica biel here
on the red carpet.

1502
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:47,281
Hi. How are you?
There you are.

1503
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:49,016
-How are you?
-I'm well, thank you.

1504
01:19:49,018 --> 01:19:50,551
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you too.

1505
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:51,886
So, tell me
about your dress.

1506
01:19:51,888 --> 01:19:53,487
Let's start with
the e! Fashion.

1507
01:19:53,489 --> 01:19:54,555
-Okay.
-Yes.

1508
01:19:54,557 --> 01:19:56,457
-This is Chanel couture.
-Mm-hmm.

1509
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:58,459
And I'm basically
just decked

1510
01:19:58,461 --> 01:20:01,061
-head to toe in Tiffany's.
-You've got arm candy

1511
01:20:01,063 --> 01:20:02,463
but not
your other arm candy.

1512
01:20:02,465 --> 01:20:03,898
-He's out on tour, isn't he?
-Yes.

1513
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:06,200
Yes, out on tour,
busy working.

1514
01:20:06,202 --> 01:20:07,434
I'm watching it on TV

1515
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:10,104
with PR's
and other stylists.

1516
01:20:10,106 --> 01:20:11,472
- Yeah.
- With other stylists?

1517
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:12,873
Yeah, I have
a couple stylists

1518
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:14,074
I'm friends with
in L.A.

1519
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:15,409
So we usually
watch it together.

1520
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:18,512
Oh, it's so mean.
It's awesome.

1521
01:20:18,514 --> 01:20:21,849
Everybody's trashing everybody
except their clients.

1522
01:20:21,851 --> 01:20:24,952
- Everyone? Really?
-Yeah, you have to be
really careful.

1523
01:20:24,954 --> 01:20:26,253
Let's just get it
on the table,

1524
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:28,189
who did who,
and let's all be nice.

1525
01:20:30,593 --> 01:20:33,027
Yeah, I mean, what do you do
when you watch the oscars?

1526
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:35,029
You comment on
what everybody's wearing.

1527
01:20:35,031 --> 01:20:41,602
You know? And it's-- it's a
great, fun TV moment.

1528
01:20:41,604 --> 01:20:45,372
Oh, it's amazing.
I'm a great commentator.

1529
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:47,374
- And I do have--
- you're a hater, too?

1530
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:50,044
I am not a hater.
It's not from hate.

1531
01:20:50,046 --> 01:20:54,548
It's from the desire
to not be mediocre

1532
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:58,219
and to really have
incredible style.

1533
01:20:58,221 --> 01:21:02,223
And to take all these
incredibly beautiful

1534
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:04,625
pieces and things
that people are creating

1535
01:21:04,627 --> 01:21:06,560
and to really
celebrate them.

1536
01:21:06,562 --> 01:21:08,529
And not in a silly way.

1537
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:11,232
In the old days when
they did celebrate beauty,

1538
01:21:11,234 --> 01:21:14,235
I mean, when Liz Taylor
won an award,

1539
01:21:14,237 --> 01:21:16,871
Liz was fabulous
and I would hope

1540
01:21:16,873 --> 01:21:18,873
that we would
get back to that day.

1541
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:20,307
'Cause those
were incredible days.

1542
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:26,580
At Hollywood's
pantages theatre

1543
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:29,116
it's the motion picture
industry's night of nights,

1544
01:21:29,118 --> 01:21:31,585
and the film capital's
top stars turn out

1545
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:36,056
for the annual presentation
of the coveted oscars.

1546
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:39,059
Jessica! Jess!

1547
01:21:42,598 --> 01:21:44,932
Jessica, I need those eyes!

1548
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:50,437
The right piece

1549
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:52,273
on the right celebrity

1550
01:21:52,275 --> 01:21:55,609
is the best p.R.

1551
01:21:55,611 --> 01:21:57,945
You can't buy that p.R.

1552
01:21:57,947 --> 01:22:02,016
It's, uh, a photograph
that is seen worldwide.

1553
01:22:02,018 --> 01:22:06,020
Um, one photograph
is picked up
by countless blogs

1554
01:22:06,022 --> 01:22:09,056
and you are focusing
on that jewelry.

1555
01:22:09,058 --> 01:22:11,125
The dress, yes,
but the jewelry

1556
01:22:11,127 --> 01:22:12,960
really makes
that photograph.

1557
01:22:12,962 --> 01:22:15,296
And the accessories
really make that outfit.

1558
01:22:15,298 --> 01:22:17,464
And at the end of the day,

1559
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:20,301
the dress is easily
knocked off.

1560
01:22:20,303 --> 01:22:23,304
The jewelry is priceless,
it's invaluable.

1561
01:22:23,306 --> 01:22:24,939
And people know
that jeweler.

1562
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:15,356
It's like--it reminds me

1563
01:23:15,358 --> 01:23:16,690
of mineral in the ocean.

1564
01:23:16,692 --> 01:23:18,993
It's different
'cause...

1565
01:23:18,995 --> 01:23:20,461
It's kind of like a motto.

1566
01:23:20,463 --> 01:23:22,663
Jewelry stores don't really
have a theme

1567
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:24,698
to what they do.

1568
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:27,368
Besides Tiffany,
no other stores

1569
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:31,705
really have, like,
a theme to their jewelry.
It's all just tropical.

1570
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:37,211
When you're young,
you want to wear a diamond.
You're gonna want to wear--

1571
01:23:37,213 --> 01:23:39,546
when you're old and you get
divorced, like, five times,

1572
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:41,281
you don't--you don't need
any of that stuff.

1573
01:23:41,283 --> 01:23:43,150
Well, ultimately,
we're talking about

1574
01:23:43,152 --> 01:23:44,752
a jewelry store.

1575
01:23:44,754 --> 01:23:49,256
How it is this pop-culture
kind of... circular weirdness.

1576
01:23:49,258 --> 01:23:51,258
All women everywhere
know that song.

1577
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:53,460
- Do they really?
-Yeah.

1578
01:23:53,462 --> 01:23:56,230
You can go ask any woman
you pass on the street

1579
01:23:56,232 --> 01:23:58,065
and they'll--they know
that song.

1580
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,207
So when this ends up
on the cutting room floor
of this film--

1581
01:24:40,209 --> 01:24:41,775
this'll make it.

1582
01:24:41,777 --> 01:24:43,377
Just let us know 'cause
we got stories about Carlyle.

1583
01:24:43,379 --> 01:24:44,812
The Carly--

1584
01:24:44,814 --> 01:24:46,447
yeah, I lost my virginity
in the Carlyle.

1585
01:24:46,449 --> 01:24:48,115
-Oh, shut up.
-With Elaine stritch.

1586
01:24:58,394 --> 01:25:00,561
The music video was filmed,
like, right here

1587
01:25:00,563 --> 01:25:03,130
I actually wrote it
on this guitar.

1588
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:38,832
I had an actress throw out
a pair of earrings.

1589
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:44,238
Like, it makes me
sick to my stomach.

1590
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:47,174
They were in tissue,
and she cleaned her room

1591
01:25:47,176 --> 01:25:49,309
and looked everywhere and said,
"i think I threw them out."

1592
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:51,578
'Cause she's paranoid
that she's a celebrity

1593
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,547
and doesn't want to leave
a messy room

1594
01:25:53,549 --> 01:25:55,849
'cause then the housekeeping
will say she's a slob.

1595
01:25:55,851 --> 01:25:58,252
And she totally
threw them out.

1596
01:25:58,254 --> 01:26:00,154
Well, there aren't
many ways

1597
01:26:00,156 --> 01:26:03,457
you can get a lotta,
like, well-known names...

1598
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:08,195
- Free in a film.
