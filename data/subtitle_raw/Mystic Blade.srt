1
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,530
Centuries ago during the times of feudal Japan,

2
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,203
armies would fight over
control of the failing empire

3
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,242
And The Shogun ruled!

4
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,810
His personal assassins
were known as shadow warriors

5
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,481
and they were the most lethal of killers

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,490
We still exist today

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,128
But now it's a global market

8
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,771
Assassins by trade,

9
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,844
we only target
men of corrupt and evil ways

10
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,249
We are always successful on our missions

11
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,607
and we never leave our targets breathing

12
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,964
We are the best in our field

13
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,362
We are the Shadow Syndicate

14
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,409
What are you barking at'?

15
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,925
Go check!

16
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,289
I'm not gonna miss next time

17
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,324
It's okay. Use the whole mag this time.

18
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,761
Last time I failed because of you

19
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,526
I shouldn't have missed

20
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,284
Hey you!

21
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,321
Hey come out

22
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,363
Something must be wrong

23
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,122
They're over there. Go!

24
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,445
Shoot!

25
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,887
Stop!

26
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,569
Where are you going? Come back!
Don't leave me here!

27
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,806
Good job 9W5

28
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,361
Let's torch this place and move out

29
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,163
My father wants to meet you all,
one on one

30
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,445
You called me here Tatsuo?

31
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,566
I am passing over the business to my son

32
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,449
With all due respect Tatsuo,

33
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,089
There is no question
that Ken is the best assassin

34
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,285
But he has plans for the Shadow Syndicate...

35
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,766
well,

36
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,923
that are less than honorable

37
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,090
Please reconsider

38
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,365
Now times have changed

39
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,608
My time is over

40
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,609
Now please leave

41
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,120
So what do you think
about Ken being the new boss?

42
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,929
It's the perfect choice.
He's the best assassin by far.

43
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,121
You know he wants us
to target the whole family.

44
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,368
I mean that's something
we haven't done before.

45
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,646
If you want, you have the guy,
I'll take the kid and wife.

46
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,324
We move out at nightfall.

47
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,483
Hey hey you! You can't stay here!
You have to leave.

48
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,449
I seem to be having trouble with my boat

49
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,050
Do you mind giving me a hand?

50
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,728
Hey whoa! Whoa whoa mate. My boat -

51
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,599
It's not starting. I don't know
if it's the battery or what or the engine,

52
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,888
Can you get a jumper lead
or something, you know I...

53
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,004
Get down on the floor

54
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,086
Get down

55
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,090
Get down!

56
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,241
Who are you?

57
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,207
Hey!

58
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,208
Sam!

59
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,044
Don't start the party without me

60
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,445
Where's the wife and kid?

61
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,731
I took care of them already

62
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,005
Good on you!
I knew you were one of the boys.

63
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,247
Oh please don't!

64
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,970
- Come here
- Please

65
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,405
Daddy

66
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,331
- Daddy
- No no please don't

67
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,644
What! You said you took care of them!

68
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,407
No!

69
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,164
You! Traitor!

70
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,284
I'll take care of you later

71
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,884
Calm down Butch, calm-

72
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,531
You gotta leave

73
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,046
You gotta disappear

74
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,602
Thank you

75
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,485
There will be others

76
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,448
C'mon, let's go

77
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,889
May I help you?

78
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,725
Sorry, I don't mean to disturb you

79
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,885
You are welcome. Please come in.

80
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,570
What is your name?

81
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,564
My name is Sam, and you?

82
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,249
<i>Caâ€œ me Phra Mam</i>

83
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,771
Be calm, don't be so tense.

84
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,487
Make yourself comfortable

85
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,008
Put your right hand over your left

86
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,284
Breathe in

87
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,086
What happened?

88
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,411
This man was attacked by a tiger

89
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,725
What's this?

90
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,642
With this herb, I can help him

91
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,011
No, don't touch!

92
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,928
This sword has spirit

93
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,605
Phra Ajarn spoke about how long time ago,

94
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,091
during the Lanna period,

95
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,242
there was a great warrior

96
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,602
In a battle to protect his kingdom,

97
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,725
opposing soldiers overpowered him,
and took his life

98
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,168
He was so revered by the people

99
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,288
that he was immediately cremated

100
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,522
so an ancient ritual could be performed

101
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,602
to keep his spirit with them

102
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,451
From his ashes they forged a blade
that would protect them

103
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,211
and could not do harm
to the ones he loved

104
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,730
Phra Ajarn,
thank you for all that you have done

105
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,044
We welcome all

106
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,444
who look for peace

107
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,642
How can I ever know peace.
I've done such dark things.

108
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,324
To find peace,

109
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,202
you must look within

110
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,371
Thank you

111
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,882
Thank you, see you later

112
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,887
Oh sorry

113
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,161
Oh, sorry

114
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,241
You speak English

115
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,481
Yes I am

116
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,289
Wait!

117
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,209
You're the girl that was in the dance earlier

118
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,209
Yes, did you like it?

119
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,209
Oh yeah it was beautiful

120
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,081
Thank you

121
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,444
Your first time around here?

122
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,725
Yeah, it's the first time

123
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,086
Do you like it?

124
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,488
It's great, yeah I like it

125
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,211
Would you like some drink?

126
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,088
Sure

127
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,850
One more milk please

128
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,128
Thank you

129
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,565
- Thank you
- It's alright

130
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,483
Come, I show you around

131
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,207
- My name is Malee
- My name is Sam

132
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,243
- Nice to meet you
- Nice to meet you

133
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,762
Look over there,
they have something interesting to show you

134
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,001
Yeah, go over there

135
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,922
Come

136
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,081
Sam, there is something I want to tell you

137
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,565
What's that?

138
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,769
I'm pregnant, 3 months

139
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,205
What'? Really?

140
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,851
WOW!

141
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,648
That's great, what should we name him?

142
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,522
If it's a girl, we call her Suree?

143
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,400
And if it's a boy,
then we'll name him Shiro

144
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,851
Q Kay

145
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,806
Yeah

146
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,444
Yeah! Woo!

147
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,044
How did you learn to do that?

148
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,087
Watching my uncle when I was a boy.
He was a blacksmith.

149
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,121
Good

150
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,367
Memee

151
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,047
Memee

152
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,359
- Hi Memee
- Hi

153
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,966
I've finished this

154
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,050
Looks beautiful

155
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,288
I cut it like this,

156
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,522
is it okay?

157
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,288
It's okay, looks nice

158
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,564
It's very beautiful

159
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,411
- Thank you
- Thank you

160
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,161
What a beauty

161
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,082
You think you can
just disappear from us, huh?

162
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,842
Did you think you could run away'?

163
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,811
<i>Shire, you have 10 be a good boy, okay'?</i>

164
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,966
Sam!

165
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,121
Stay here, don't go away, okay?

166
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,563
Stay here, I love you Shiro

167
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,724
And this is for Butch

168
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,601
Enough

169
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,730
See you in hell

170
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,842
Sam! Sam!

171
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,247
Sam!

172
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,522
Stop it

173
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,003
Sam!

174
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,246
Come here!

175
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,405
Leave me alone

176
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,410
Is this you girl?

177
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,205
Leave her alone!

178
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,810
Sam!

179
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,001
Sam

180
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,811
No!

181
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,165
Let's go

182
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,605
Shiro

183
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,966
Shiro

184
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,080
Shiro

185
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,971
Malee

186
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,411
The jungle is dark

187
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,411
And my enemy tall

188
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,088
It's left me feeling weak
and naked and terribly small

189
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,845
So I cling to the life

190
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,491
That came from her death

191
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:05,207
I walk til I'm weary way passed
feeling weary not stopping to rest

192
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,040
And I won't settle

193
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,245
Just to settle the score

194
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,600
There's nothing left
if there is nothing worth fighting for

195
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,126
I cut with the sword

196
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,251
Made of spirit and flame

197
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,605
Tearing through the terror the darkness
getting nearer protecting my name

198
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,251
And I won't settle

199
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,410
Just to settle the score

200
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:50,890
There's nothing left
if there is nothing worth fighting for

201
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:59,529
I've got nothing left
if I've got nothing worth fighting for

202
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,091
The Shadow Syndicate
receives their assignments

203
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,561
from a satellite signal that can be accessed

204
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,082
from tall buildings
and a set of computer codes

205
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,286
Together, they're invincible

206
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,203
So I will hunt them down, one by one

207
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,528
I will show them no mercy

208
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,002
and I will slaughter them all

209
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,046
I prepared false passports for Shiro and I

210
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,522
I cannot leave Shiro with Phra Ajarn

211
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,968
The Shadow Syndicate
can find anyone, anywhere

212
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,369
So the safest place for him,

213
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,250
is with me

214
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,649
Hey Joseph!

215
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,564
Hey Sam!

216
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,247
Oh my god, my old friend

217
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,165
- Good to see you my old friend
- Yeah, good to see you too

218
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,288
Hey, that's a cute little boy you got there

219
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,441
<i>This is Shire</i>

220
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,730
Nice to meet you Shiro,
please come have a seat

221
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,121
Alright, you're my guest

222
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,487
Futoma, bring the tea please

223
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,244
Just a minute

224
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,524
Can you take Shiro to the back
to play with the other kids?

225
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,768
Yah, my sister will take care of Shiro

226
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,961
She's got like a hundred-

227
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,371
I'll be gone for a few days

228
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,205
I'll be back as soon as possible, okay?

229
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,246
What kind of trouble
did you get yourself into this time?

230
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,282
So, has everything been arranged?

231
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,283
Nevermind, I don't want to know

232
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,964
Everything has been arranged

233
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,206
Here's the tickets,
and you leave 6 o'clock local time

234
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,562
And this, is for you

235
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,770
After what you did for me,

236
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,729
If something happens to me,
give this to my boy okay?

237
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,201
Q Kay

238
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,326
Take care

239
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,888
I'll be back in a few days

240
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,524
I couldn't take Shiro with me

241
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,167
The desert elements
would've been too hard on him

242
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,607
And so, I must go it alone

243
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,287
My first target, is Red

244
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,202
He was a mercenary before being
employed by the Shadow Syndicate

245
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,528
And since Ken took over the business,

246
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,484
they will work for anyone
who pays a premium

247
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,645
Even if it's terrorists

248
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,731
Huh! We used to kill terrorists

249
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,401
C'mon, come here, c'mon

250
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,091
Are you getting everything ready?

251
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,404
C'mon, I told you, I told you.
Everything was-

252
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,290
Yah I'm trying boss,
I just talked to them

253
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,766
Just take care of it, okay?

254
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,526
Tomorrow we have training exercises

255
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,929
Okay boss, I'll take care of everything

256
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,961
Hey you get m work!

257
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,046
Get to work, get to work

258
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,320
What the?

259
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,008
No, please! No!

260
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,440
What the?

261
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,447
Who are you?!

262
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,761
Sam!

263
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,361
But you're...

264
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,641
dead?

265
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,290
So this is
what the Shadow Syndicates do in these days?

266
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,564
Training terrorists,
killing innocent people?

267
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,849
Killing's our business

268
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,201
and Ken has opened our market

269
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,364
We are making more money
than ever before

270
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,845
And my wife?

271
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,329
You know what happens
when you cross the Syndicate

272
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,087
Then you're gonna find out
what happens when you cross me!

273
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,964
I go to Cage's hideout

274
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,204
An environment only
he's tough enough to survive in

275
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,968
Not even the rats stay here

276
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,370
Cage was born on the streets, he was raised on the streets,

277
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,045
and he rules the streets

278
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,409
And tonight, he'll die on the streets

279
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,523
How you doing my boy, huh?

280
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,251
I'll be right back, okay?

281
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,803
I won't be long, I promise

282
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,727
Cage!

283
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,286
What do you want?

284
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,205
You know what I want

285
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,288
C'mon!

286
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,888
You think you can kill me'?

287
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,764
You piece of shit!

288
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,845
To find Yo, I go to his home
and walk the winding streets of the slum

289
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,084
Many here look up to Yo

290
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,727
A deadly killer with lots of money

291
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,488
To them, he's a hero,
a modern day Robin Hood

292
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,124
To me, he's a soon-to-be-dead punk

293
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,243
C'mon, baby, fight!

294
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,964
That's right!

295
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,286
I'm betting 2:1

296
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,125
Bring it on! Take your try!

297
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,283
See? See?

298
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,122
Let them know what you've got

299
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,046
Bite! Bite!

300
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,249
Woah! the tail's loose!

301
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:06,442
Hey pal, what are you doing here baby

302
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,250
Hey you, I'll take care of your child

303
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,924
He's dead meat

304
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,162
How dare he step on our ground

305
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,164
Who does he think he is?

306
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,841
What do you say boss?

307
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,087
Just look at him

308
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,641
I didn't think you would get here so soon

309
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,731
Not soon enough!

310
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,009
You know I don't like weapons

311
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,605
but if you want we can do that

312
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,846
Get him

313
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,887
- Hey you!
- Hey no need, I'll take care of him

314
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,126
Watch

315
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,850
Let's go Shiro

316
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,809
My next target is Yak

317
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,042
More of a monster than a man

318
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,330
People in his homeland believed
he was a tree ghost

319
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,846
He's not a ghost

320
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,765
But when I'm through with him,
he will be

321
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,331
<i>Sh, sh, R's okay Shire, daddy's here</i>

322
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,487
Hush little baby, don't say a word

323
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,968
Daddy's gonna buy you a mocking bird

324
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:10,728
Sh, sh, go to sleep Shiro

325
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,650
Before my showdown with Ken

326
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,486
I must leave Shiro
with one of the few people I trust

327
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,881
<i>Ry o-san</i>

328
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,404
He is a swordmaker,
and he lives the old ways of the samurai

329
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:12,243
When I was a little boy,
my parents died in an accident

330
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,162
and I was left alone

331
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,969
My uncle arrived

332
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,523
and took me to live with him

333
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,764
He taught me how to fight,

334
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,170
how to survive,

335
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,570
and how to live off the land

336
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,209
But he was a tormented soul

337
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,249
Haunted by his demons,

338
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,721
he couldn't take care of me

339
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:07,123
So he sent me on an old fishing boat,
to a distant land

340
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,607
to find a person he thought could

341
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,845
When I arrived, I walked and I walked

342
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,441
until I couldn't walk anymore

343
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,808
And that's when Ryo-san found me

344
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,162
That meet, gave me shelter

345
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,284
and he honed my skills

346
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:41,204
And that's when Tatsuo recruited me

347
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,805
<i>Ry o-san</i>

348
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,081
Sam

349
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,203
- I'm happy to see you Ryo-san
- Yeah

350
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,884
This is my son, Shiro

351
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,526
Very lovely

352
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,561
I have to ask if I can
leave him here with you for a while

353
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,722
There's something important I must do

354
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,649
and you're the only person I trust

355
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,405
Can I leave him with you?

356
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,449
Okay, I'll take care of him. Okay.

357
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,845
Here you go

358
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,440
It's okay, cry

359
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,086
Shiro, I'll be back as soon as possible

360
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,041
I love you

361
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,088
Of all the assassins on my hit list,

362
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,567
Ken is the one that I'm most worried of

363
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,169
This is why
I've decided to meet him face to face

364
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,721
No surprises, no ambush

365
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,765
So I sent him a message

366
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,162
I arranged the date, and the location

367
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,886
Despite the risks involved,
I wanted to meet him on his own turf

368
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,290
I want him to know
the seriousness of my intentions

369
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,451
I want him to know
that no place is safe for him

370
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,848
Not even his own backyard

371
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,201
Sam, you managed to kill my whole team

372
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,164
I'm impressed

373
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,970
I didn't come here to talk

374
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,571
You know you won't leave here alive

375
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,284
So what do you think Sam?

376
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:51,364
Maybe I'll just cut off your limbs

377
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,325
So you can spend the rest of your days

378
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,370
in guilt

379
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,762
It's you who caused

380
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,649
your wife's death

381
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,803
whose only crime is
that she loved the wrong man

382
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,851
Maybe I'll visit your son,
when I'm done with you

383
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,282
C'mon

384
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,567
So it seems that in the end,

385
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,001
it is you who'll have the happy ending

386
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:23,409
Soon you'll join
your wife on the other side

387
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:27,203
That is, of course, if she will have you,

388
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,401
if she can forgive you for
what you have done

389
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,205
So at last Shiro and I can live in peace

390
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,407
Still, because of my former life,

391
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,644
we must lay low

392
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,571
I miss Malee

393
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,288
And Shiro, he misses his mom

394
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,445
Try, throw me the ball, c'mon

395
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:34,887
C'mon

396
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,321
Oh, good throw, c'mon

397
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,324
C'mon, over here, c'mon

398
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,170
Okay, woah! What a kick!

399
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,486
Q Kay

400
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,207
Shiro!

401
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,126
Shiro

402
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,527
Shiro!

403
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,121
Tatsuo

404
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,204
let him go

405
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,244
I take your son,

406
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,449
like you took my son

407
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,126
Ken wasn't as honorable as you

408
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,289
He had no boundaries

409
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,204
and he killed my wife

410
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,521
Please,

411
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,891
I'm begging You

412
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,646
Let him go, you can take my life

413
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,760
As you wish!

414
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,366
Sam

415
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,765
Sam

416
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,081
Sam

417
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,809
Use the blade

418
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,211
You okay?

419
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,362
I saw your mommy here with us today

420
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,641
C'mon

421
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,007
I realize now that
she's always with us

422
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,410
She's in the wind, she's in the trees

423
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,407
She's in the earth and in the sky

424
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,089
She's everywhere

425
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,847
You okay my son? Yeah?
Let's go home now

426
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,127
- Daddy go home
- Yeah
