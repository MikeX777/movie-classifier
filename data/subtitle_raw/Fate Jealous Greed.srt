1
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:44,492
"Reason"

2
00:00:46,034 --> 00:00:48,361
"Chapter 1"

3
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:50,735
"Gold means nothing,
and so do slivery"

4
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:53,200
"None of them means anything
after one's death"

5
00:01:10,326 --> 00:01:13,152
- Husband, can you answer it?
- Sure.

6
00:01:13,242 --> 00:01:16,492
Hey boy, no cheating.
It is better to come with me.

7
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:19,825
What?

8
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:21,403
A letter for you.

9
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:25,867
Okay, let me get a pen.

10
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:35,534
Anybody? No signature needed?

11
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:37,486
Anybody?

12
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:47,576
Invitation?

13
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,610
"From now on, you will be in
good fortune for 3 days."

14
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,944
"Afterwards, you will die."

15
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:54,992
Is it kidding? Nonsense.

16
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,242
Who is it?

17
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,659
Wrongly sent letter

18
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,027
You should prepare the table now,
we can have meals shortly.

19
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:03,111
Okay, then.

20
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:05,409
Hey son, let's do it.

21
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:09,451
Put back to
the management office later.

22
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:25,783
Wait, please wait!

23
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:29,367
Why can't you wait a bitt?

24
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:48,409
Exercise is good for health.

25
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:54,492
I am arriving.

26
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:58,069
Hey guy, what happened?

27
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,367
Lift number 3 got problem,
I am going to call the service.

28
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,152
It is lucky that I missed the lift,
or I must be late to office.

29
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:05,367
I go to work now.

30
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:26,825
Where are the people?

31
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:34,819
Wife, what happened?

32
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:38,326
Husband,
somebody were trapped in the lift.

33
00:03:38,742 --> 00:03:40,152
I know that, I am fine.

34
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:41,700
I go down by stairs.

35
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:44,200
Hey, you are smart.

36
00:03:44,618 --> 00:03:46,451
Sure, otherwise
I would be late to office.

37
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,693
It is no big deal
if you are just late for work.

38
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:52,742
So, what is the point?

39
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:58,860
The trapped people were saved,

40
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,409
but I found that
they were seriously hurt.

41
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:04,618
How come of it?

42
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,985
They said that not only
did the lift out of order,

43
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:10,069
but also the circulation system.

44
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,992
The trapped people could
only be saved after a half hour.

45
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:15,117
How could it take so long?

46
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:16,783
It is.

47
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:18,819
How are those victims?

48
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:21,742
They looked like dead people.

49
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:25,075
You scared me.

50
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:28,075
Miss Yu wants to see you.

51
00:04:30,117 --> 00:04:31,492
Very bad situation.

52
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,779
When did you be here?
Why don't you turn on the light?

53
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,825
I have to hang up, bye.

54
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:52,950
- Chiu.
- Yes?

55
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:55,367
Are you here for almost 10 years?

56
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:57,242
Should be 12 years.

57
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,629
Well, you are
a well experienced staff then.

58
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:00,986
Yes.

59
00:05:01,742 --> 00:05:03,902
However, the result of your team
is quite poor this year.

60
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:05,075
Do you realize that?

61
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:10,451
Actually, all of us
are we working very hard.

62
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,194
However, the market is so bad...

63
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:16,909
Even my 6 years old son
can understand the situation

64
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,277
Yes, I am glad to hear that.

65
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:20,075
Even so, don't worry.

66
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:23,860
We are going to make new plans
for the coming year,

67
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,699
we are confident that
we can have a better future.

68
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:29,659
Sure I know your capability.

69
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:33,284
Nevertheless, I have to inform you.

70
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,825
What is it, Miss Yu?

71
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:38,576
I just fired Chung for you.

72
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:41,326
Why? He is a good staff.

73
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:45,367
I passed by a bar
after seeing clients last week,

74
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:48,618
I saw him having fun in it.

75
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:51,409
But that was 2:30 pm
and still in office hour,

76
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:53,742
I can't tolerate that.

77
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:58,242
So, no begging for him,
I have made my mind.

78
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:03,319
Regarding you, do try your best,

79
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:05,451
the company is counting on you
for the next year.

80
00:06:16,618 --> 00:06:20,200
That is really good luck,
I didn't being caught by Miss Yu.

81
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:24,159
Chiu, are you okay?

82
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:30,200
Chung, what is your idea?

83
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:37,451
What do you mean? What idea?

84
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:40,659
Surely I have to find another job.

85
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:43,194
I have begged for you,

86
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:44,950
but she didn't listen to me.

87
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:54,284
I realized that it was my bad luck.

88
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,284
Everybody knows
Miss Yu is so ruthless.

89
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,159
I will try to ask help
for you in the field, okay?

90
00:07:09,534 --> 00:07:11,200
Okay, thanks for your help.

91
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:17,242
But I think it won't be easy.

92
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:22,069
Yeah.

93
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:25,783
Actually you and me
were together in the bar,

94
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:27,950
having fun at that same time.

95
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:33,992
Why did she can just see me
but not you?

96
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:36,867
You really get a good fortune.

97
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,867
Turn bad things to good.

98
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:48,159
3 days later you will go to hell.

99
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:50,200
You got that yesterday,

100
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:53,034
3 days means the day after tomorrow.

101
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:54,825
Still not bad.

102
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,409
How come?

103
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:58,665
You can still have
one more horse race betting.

104
00:07:58,825 --> 00:07:59,819
Yeah, I think so.

105
00:08:00,075 --> 00:08:01,699
I am serious.

106
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:03,361
I am serious too.

107
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:06,909
Should you help me to bring
some gifts to the King of Hell?

108
00:08:07,242 --> 00:08:09,069
So I can have a better life

109
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:10,027
after my death.

110
00:08:10,117 --> 00:08:12,152
Is that funny?

111
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,042
You can give him by yourself
through internet.

112
00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:18,783
Hey bros,
do you really believe that?

113
00:08:19,492 --> 00:08:21,783
It didn't depend on me.
Could you see that?

114
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:24,950
I got really good luck today.

115
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:27,027
Are you serious?

116
00:08:27,117 --> 00:08:30,699
There are so many
such bad jokes around.

117
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:33,944
Did you ever get a message

118
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:36,742
which asked you to forward
that to 10 persons,

119
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:41,075
otherwise you would get bad lucks?

120
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:42,992
Yes, I got it before.

121
00:08:43,618 --> 00:08:44,699
Don't be serious with that.

122
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:52,992
Hello, my name is Bond.

123
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:55,528
Madam, it is your drink.

124
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,618
Thanks.

125
00:08:57,909 --> 00:08:58,909
Oh, sorry.

126
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:01,909
Okay, I can make it.

127
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,034
You are wet.
Should I dry it up for you?

128
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:06,445
How?

129
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:09,236
I just live upstairs.
You can go to my home.

130
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:10,909
Go to her home?

131
00:09:11,326 --> 00:09:12,652
You are too welcome.

132
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:15,528
I mean I get a hair dryer upstairs.

133
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:17,693
Oh, it is
a very attractive suggestion.

134
00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:21,069
It is ok, thanks. I am leaving.

135
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,444
It is still early,
let me buy you a drink.

136
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:24,700
Great!

137
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:26,909
Thanks and no needed,
we still get beers.

138
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:29,610
Yes, my name is Juicy.

139
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,777
- How are you?
- Can we exchange the contact.

140
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:33,909
We can meet next time here.

141
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:38,528
Sorry that I try to fix it
in the rest room first.

142
00:09:38,618 --> 00:09:40,367
Juicy, is that really juicy?

143
00:09:40,742 --> 00:09:43,528
Can I get your phone number?

144
00:09:43,618 --> 00:09:45,069
Then I can pass to him, okay?

145
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,742
My phone number is...

146
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:51,451
Are you exchanging contact
with my girl?

147
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:53,825
Just for a normal friendship.

148
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:57,152
Normal friendship?
I do like make friends very much.

149
00:09:57,242 --> 00:09:58,902
How about we go out to know
each other much more.

150
00:09:58,992 --> 00:10:00,200
You are too welcome.

151
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:09,075
Oh, please calm down.

152
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:13,610
How come of it?
How come I have such staff?

153
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,860
Boss, it is very difficult

154
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,152
to recruit a local right now
in Hong Kong.

155
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,693
By the way, aren't you going to
explore the new market?

156
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:19,950
What an idiot?

157
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:35,700
How open mind they are?

158
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:38,361
I leave now.

159
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:04,576
Hold it!

160
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:11,902
- Faster!
- Number 5, 8 and 10.

161
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:13,618
- There we go!
- Faster!

162
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:15,075
Okay, they did it.

163
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:17,742
It's great.

164
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:21,674
It pushed at a perfect moment
to win that.

165
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:26,200
Hey, did you win the Tierce?

166
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,153
Hey, man.

167
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:34,200
What is it? Did you win big?

168
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,700
Or just get the first trio of 3T?

169
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,492
It seems you have got a big winning.

170
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:44,515
What did you get
for the second trio?

171
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,950
Number 4 with number 2, 6 or 12.

172
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,409
Number 4 with what?

173
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:53,783
Number 4 with number 2, 6, 9 or 12.

174
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:58,867
Mine similar as yours.

175
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,409
I get 4 on 6, 10 and all round.

176
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:13,277
Oh, the second trio comes now.

177
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,492
It is so excited.

178
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:22,534
Don't hurry, the bend is coming.

179
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,284
Hold it.

180
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:30,909
Go!

181
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:32,242
I make it.

182
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:34,277
I got the second trio too!

183
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:35,361
Let's cheers!

184
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:38,576
I got 2 trios already.

185
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:43,783
Hey bros, did you make it?

186
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,693
It was too hot,
just thousands for these 2 trios.

187
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:54,783
Thousands are money,
don't be too greedy.

188
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:01,783
It can't help.

189
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:12,034
Brother Chiu,
did you follow with that guy?

190
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:14,027
No, we are just so similar on that.

191
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:14,985
He is a poor guy,

192
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:17,159
I just want to remind you
do not follow him.

193
00:13:17,534 --> 00:13:18,402
How poor he is?

194
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:20,902
You really don't know that?
Oh, everybody know.

195
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:22,610
He is living in
subdivided unit upstairs.

196
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,402
Did that mean bad fortune?

197
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:26,860
Let me tell you, his wife left him.

198
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,902
He owes large amount of money.

199
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:31,735
He is a guarantor for a big debt,

200
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:32,860
collectors come often
and make disturbs.

201
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,034
So bad really?

202
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,735
Not merely that.
His son got kidney disease.

203
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:38,652
He has to work and take care his son
at the same time,

204
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:40,367
he is really poor.

205
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:44,909
It is really a tragedy,
or is he going to be doomed?

206
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:49,326
Iced lemon tea.

207
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:56,945
There is an extra bonus
for this upcoming three Trios.

208
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,194
Millions...

209
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:00,534
Big pool of bonuses.

210
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,159
- What did you get?
- Sure it is a big pool.

211
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:08,659
Number 8, 9 and 10
on all around for the final trio.

212
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:10,534
I got number 1, 8 and 9.

213
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:13,200
We just got one different.

214
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:15,699
Maybe either you or me
win the big prize.

215
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,367
It is the final trio!

216
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,699
Can I have a smoke?

217
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:31,742
Ok, get the whole pack.

218
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:33,159
Thanks.

219
00:14:37,783 --> 00:14:39,159
It comes now.

220
00:14:44,742 --> 00:14:52,117
Number 8, 9 and 10...

221
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:54,277
Hold it!

222
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:58,867
Faster!

223
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,194
Are you kidding?

224
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:06,361
I really get the fortune,
I win the pool!

225
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:08,618
- Congratulations
- What a luck, I get millions!

226
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,159
No way.

227
00:15:37,326 --> 00:15:42,284
I got really god fortune
after receiving this letter.

228
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,700
It is not kidding.

229
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,609
So, what does it stand for?

230
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:53,569
How will be me?

231
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:55,159
You will die.

232
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,326
How come of it?

233
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:00,194
When you were in good shape,

234
00:16:00,284 --> 00:16:04,034
did you find any special around you?

235
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,699
I found in these two days.
The better I got,

236
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:11,867
the worse the people
around would be.

237
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:13,825
The worst came yesterday,

238
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:17,034
the man besides me killed himself
after losing all games.

239
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:22,034
There is an absolute balance
in the universe,

240
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:24,618
there is gain and loss in karma.

241
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,534
Gaining too much will bring you
great loss in return.

242
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:32,699
Once your life
can no longer afford it,

243
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,576
death would be the result.

244
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:39,444
You said you won the 3 Trio?

245
00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:41,451
- Yes.
- What is the amount?

246
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:42,609
4 million something.

247
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:43,992
How about this?

248
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:48,409
Go cash it all out immediately,

249
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:51,699
then wronged spent them all
within one day.

250
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:54,319
Cash it all? How wronged should be?

251
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:57,236
- Do you want to die?
- Sure not.

252
00:16:57,326 --> 00:17:00,110
Then try you best to spend it all
in one day.

253
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,950
In a wronged manner.

254
00:17:02,576 --> 00:17:03,444
It is so easy,

255
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:05,444
I always can donate it,
share it or even burn it.

256
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:09,659
Not like this,
it must be in a wronged way.

257
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:10,652
Do you understand?

258
00:17:10,742 --> 00:17:11,609
How should I do?

259
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,610
Don't waste time.

260
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,194
Cash it as soon as possible,

261
00:17:16,284 --> 00:17:19,902
the working hour will be off soon.

262
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:21,110
Do you really understand?

263
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,992
The clock is ticking,
you should go now.

264
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,492
Remember to wronge spent them all.

265
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:56,326
There is gain and loss.

266
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,699
Gaining too much will bring you
great loss in return.

267
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:03,492
Once your life
can no longer afford it,

268
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,075
death would be the result.

269
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,409
You said you won the 3 Trio.

270
00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:11,486
- Yes.
- What is the amount?

271
00:18:11,576 --> 00:18:12,569
4 million something.

272
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:13,783
How about this?

273
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:18,326
Go cash it immediately,

274
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:21,534
then wronged spent them all
within one day.

275
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:22,652
It is so easy,

276
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:24,277
I always can donate it,
share it or even burn it.

277
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:25,528
Not in this way.

278
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:28,618
Must be in a wronged way.

279
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,117
Remember that wronged spent it.

280
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:49,034
What's wrong with you?

281
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:51,075
Sir, what is the problem?

282
00:18:59,075 --> 00:19:02,075
It is cop. What are you doing here?

283
00:19:04,492 --> 00:19:06,492
- Do you know each other?
- No, we don't know...

284
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:10,284
Really? So what are you doing?

285
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:12,034
Just walk around

286
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,034
How come? It is a dead end

287
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:15,659
How about you?

288
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:16,909
I am smoking.

289
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,159
ID card please?

290
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:31,492
- Who get this?
- It's mine.

291
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:33,242
Open it.

292
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:35,159
Slowly.

293
00:19:39,992 --> 00:19:41,284
Why is there so much money?

294
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:42,742
Cash it from bank.

295
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:44,034
Is there any proof?

296
00:19:47,492 --> 00:19:50,284
I got the receipt
and there was my ID number.

297
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:02,742
Sir, may I go now?

298
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:05,534
Okay.

299
00:20:08,451 --> 00:20:10,909
Don't stay too long
with such big amount of money.

300
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:15,200
I don't want either.

301
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,610
Give me a pack of cigarettes.

302
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,992
- Which brand?
- Anyone.

303
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,194
Here.

304
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:40,451
- Take it.
- Okay.

305
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:48,659
You get changes.

306
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:51,361
Here you are.

307
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:52,486
When is it now?

308
00:20:52,576 --> 00:20:53,783
You mean what time is it?

309
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:55,534
Ten thirty.

310
00:20:56,992 --> 00:21:00,742
By this way...

311
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,950
Hey, big boss.
Please feel free to choose.

312
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:36,534
- I want expensive one.
- Yes?

313
00:21:38,284 --> 00:21:40,159
You only want expensive one.

314
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,783
Ok, let me show you.

315
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:51,451
Though this one costs
only hundred thousands.

316
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,034
That is very special since it is
the one and only one in the world.

317
00:21:56,367 --> 00:22:00,110
Just watch and no touch.

318
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,069
Must be careful.

319
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:04,659
You have to pay for any damage.
Let's enjoy it.

320
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:13,152
You see, I get lots of money.

321
00:22:13,242 --> 00:22:14,152
Yeah.

322
00:22:14,242 --> 00:22:16,159
But, even I buy it...

323
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,735
Oh it is really wronged.
This antique is from Tong Dynasty.

324
00:22:20,825 --> 00:22:23,409
How come you wrongly break it.
You have to pay for it.

325
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:24,700
What did you say before?

326
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:26,693
Wronged? Did you said it is wronged?

327
00:22:26,783 --> 00:22:28,451
- Of course.
- Thank you so much.

328
00:22:29,492 --> 00:22:30,742
How much is it?

329
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:32,569
This one costs 500 thousands

330
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:33,700
500 thousands.

331
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,652
- How about this?
- 300 thousands.

332
00:22:36,742 --> 00:22:39,117
Are you kidding? It is so cheap.

333
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:43,444
Is there any much more expensive?

334
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:44,528
Sure, I get one for 700 thousands.

335
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:47,486
- Where?
- Here...

336
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:49,361
This one belonged to Queen Yeung
in the Tong Dynasty.

337
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,992
700 thousands.

338
00:22:51,284 --> 00:22:53,569
700 thousands, so cheap!

339
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:56,284
- Anymore?
- Sure!

340
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:59,534
This is our shop's best,
Emperor Qin Shihuang's.

341
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:01,152
2 million, I give you a discount.

342
00:23:01,242 --> 00:23:02,069
No way!

343
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,819
I want the original price,
not any discount is needed.

344
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:05,610
2 million is good for me, deal?

345
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,569
Okay...

346
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:07,867
Is that 2 million?

347
00:23:09,492 --> 00:23:10,486
Go on...

348
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:11,402
It is almost there.

349
00:23:11,492 --> 00:23:12,909
Let me calculate.

350
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,992
Ten, fifty, thirty...

351
00:23:17,742 --> 00:23:19,492
4.1 millions only.

352
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,700
4.1 millions,
so 300 thousands is still needed.

353
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:26,652
How much of this?

354
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:28,569
It worth only hundreds.

355
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,409
Cheap stuffs with low prices.

356
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,069
No, this is an antique
even it got only 3 days' history,

357
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,825
can you charge me by 50 thousands?

358
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:36,451
Sure...

359
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,610
- That counts for 50 thousands.
- How about these?

360
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,242
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

361
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,659
Total in 300 thousands?

362
00:23:45,618 --> 00:23:48,909
4.4 million will just make it.

363
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:54,825
Okay, I finally fix it.

364
00:23:55,284 --> 00:23:57,486
"Clap your hands"

365
00:23:57,576 --> 00:23:59,777
"Let's enjoy
this wonderful singing tonight"

366
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:02,159
"Why? Why? Tell me why"

367
00:24:48,117 --> 00:24:49,277
Give me a pack of cigarettes.

368
00:24:49,783 --> 00:24:50,950
Here.

369
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:53,367
Okay.

370
00:24:56,825 --> 00:24:57,992
You get changes.

371
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:03,867
By this way...

372
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:12,200
It is not for fun,
you will die because of it.

373
00:25:12,451 --> 00:25:13,909
You said you won the 3 Trios?

374
00:25:14,284 --> 00:25:17,409
Go cash it all out immediately,

375
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,700
then wronged spent them all
within one day.

376
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,992
Remember to wronge spent them all.

377
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:36,326
Mama, I want to keep
all father's belonging,

378
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:41,618
Sure, I understood that.

379
00:25:42,284 --> 00:25:43,742
I got the same feeling as you.

380
00:25:45,825 --> 00:25:48,825
Mama, I miss Papa so much.

381
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:55,492
I miss him too.

382
00:26:02,783 --> 00:26:03,950
What is this?

383
00:26:10,284 --> 00:26:13,700
Who send us such bad thing?

384
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:20,783
Papa got this days before,

385
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,367
it was dispatched
by a man without leg.

386
00:26:25,783 --> 00:26:26,909
What?

387
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,326
A letter for you.

388
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,783
I get a pen first.

389
00:26:42,742 --> 00:26:44,117
A man without leg?

390
00:26:46,576 --> 00:26:49,699
You can't tell lies. I hate lies.

391
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,699
Mama, I am telling the truth.

392
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,200
A letter for you.

393
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:07,528
"Chapter 2"

394
00:27:07,618 --> 00:27:09,652
"Wife means nothing,
and so do children"

395
00:27:09,742 --> 00:27:12,222
"None of them can accompany you
on the path at the netherworld"

396
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:28,492
Sir, the thing inside is very dirty.

397
00:27:32,075 --> 00:27:36,693
You should go back home now
and never come back.

398
00:27:36,783 --> 00:27:40,534
- Just go.
- I back home now.

399
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,367
And no rude manner anymore.

400
00:27:46,576 --> 00:27:49,117
What a stubborn stupid.

401
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:51,409
"Beautiful school girls"

402
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:56,242
Bye-bye and come next time.

403
00:27:58,534 --> 00:28:00,326
I won't serve woman.

404
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:03,200
I am Shemale, not woman.

405
00:28:04,825 --> 00:28:07,534
Great, I have never met
Shemale before anyway.

406
00:28:07,783 --> 00:28:09,284
Well, come on in.

407
00:28:12,783 --> 00:28:15,652
Tell you my charges first,

408
00:28:15,742 --> 00:28:19,277
100 dollars for one time
and 150 for twice.

409
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:23,284
Free of charge
if you can treat me high.

410
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:27,699
You are really famous
for such cheap charges.

411
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,992
Sure, I am doing for fun.

412
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:33,652
Really?

413
00:28:33,742 --> 00:28:38,034
No way,
I think you are taking revenge.

414
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:40,909
Oh, it comes an idiot again.

415
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:54,326
So, you are not Shemale.

416
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:58,735
Sure not,
I get bigger breast than you.

417
00:28:58,825 --> 00:29:00,699
Then, what do you want? Miss idiot.

418
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:08,860
It is that bad guy
did make you suicide,

419
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:12,576
but his wife is innocent.

420
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:15,451
That man lied to me.

421
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,909
Don't you know that
my death got two life?

422
00:29:19,284 --> 00:29:22,576
Do you know
what is a perfect revenge?

423
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:25,534
Make him better to die.

424
00:29:25,699 --> 00:29:27,409
I make her wife a hooker,

425
00:29:27,825 --> 00:29:30,159
it is too good by just killing him.

426
00:29:32,783 --> 00:29:35,909
Indeed, the man has regretted.

427
00:29:36,576 --> 00:29:38,326
I do have nothing to say.

428
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:42,950
I want his wife to have AIDS.

429
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:44,783
That is none of you business.

430
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,284
You either terminate me or leave,

431
00:29:48,576 --> 00:29:51,409
otherwise I will kill you too.

432
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,659
What a stubborn stupid.

433
00:30:01,783 --> 00:30:02,992
Miss demon,

434
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:06,451
do you get hot water.

435
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:10,534
Don't you need to eat noodles
for extra energy?

436
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:16,825
I will vomit after exorcism,

437
00:30:17,699 --> 00:30:20,159
so, get something to eat first.

438
00:30:22,534 --> 00:30:26,825
Are you kidding?

439
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,950
How come you an exorcist?

440
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:36,326
Actually,
that is my family business.

441
00:30:36,742 --> 00:30:39,659
My father said I get the talent.

442
00:30:40,576 --> 00:30:42,902
So, where is your weapon?

443
00:30:42,992 --> 00:30:44,576
Oh, these really are.

444
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:51,576
The signal is not good.

445
00:30:54,034 --> 00:30:59,699
This China made comes the best.

446
00:31:00,699 --> 00:31:03,200
No need to be expensive.

447
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,451
What are you doing?

448
00:31:06,034 --> 00:31:09,451
This is an apps for exorcism.

449
00:31:10,576 --> 00:31:12,075
So, I lock you up now.

450
00:31:29,492 --> 00:31:31,700
I told before I get the talent.

451
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:47,612
Hey, Kin.

452
00:31:48,618 --> 00:31:50,159
How have you been recently?

453
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:51,693
What?

454
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:53,659
Something in urgency?

455
00:31:53,783 --> 00:31:55,909
Okay, see me in the shop.

456
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:23,284
Husband, may I ask you a question?

457
00:32:24,117 --> 00:32:25,783
No thinking and answer it at once.

458
00:32:27,618 --> 00:32:33,284
Who is the most beautiful woman
in this universe?

459
00:32:34,284 --> 00:32:35,367
Louder please.

460
00:32:35,992 --> 00:32:39,409
Right, that is your wife, me.

461
00:32:58,492 --> 00:32:59,492
Anybody here?

462
00:33:01,699 --> 00:33:02,693
Anybody here?

463
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,699
Husband, happy birthday.

464
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:56,659
I know that
when you watch this video,

465
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,326
maybe I have been left.

466
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:02,700
I know you still miss me very much,

467
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:07,576
but you cannot be sad forever.

468
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:11,618
Since you look ugly when you cry.

469
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:37,451
Do you still remember the place
we dated for the first time?

470
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:41,326
You go there quickly
and I wait for you there.

471
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,652
Ling today accompany me here

472
00:34:46,742 --> 00:34:48,451
to give you a surprise,

473
00:34:49,075 --> 00:34:51,576
so I make a video here.

474
00:34:52,117 --> 00:34:54,825
And try to give you
a very special birthday greeting.

475
00:34:58,075 --> 00:35:02,950
Do not cry, you look ugly when cry.

476
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:11,326
Yes, my wife.

477
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:18,367
Do you remember that
you accidentally kissed me here?

478
00:35:20,825 --> 00:35:22,409
Not so accidentally.

479
00:35:24,117 --> 00:35:26,200
Since I knew you want to kiss me,

480
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:28,950
so I success your wish.

481
00:35:29,492 --> 00:35:32,618
No way, it is not true.

482
00:35:35,242 --> 00:35:38,699
Wife, I miss you very much.

483
00:35:49,326 --> 00:35:53,486
Husband,

484
00:35:53,576 --> 00:35:54,652
here comes another video,

485
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:56,944
I hoped that
you will not feel annoying.

486
00:35:57,034 --> 00:35:59,319
I bought some good things
for you, Ka-wei.

487
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:00,652
What is going on, Ling?

488
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:01,985
Kin, see?

489
00:36:02,075 --> 00:36:04,159
I bring them for Ka-wei.

490
00:36:05,576 --> 00:36:06,735
- It is a very rich mask, see?
- Indeed.

491
00:36:06,825 --> 00:36:10,451
- It sounds good.
- Let us apply it now.

492
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:14,110
We will see about it.

493
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,409
"Stop laughing,
or you will get wrinkles"

494
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,576
- Ling.
- Kin.

495
00:36:23,034 --> 00:36:25,902
I got Ka-wei's video last night,
thanks.

496
00:36:25,992 --> 00:36:27,194
My pleasure,

497
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:30,326
I will try the best to help Ka-wei.

498
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:34,867
I want to get all Ka-wei's videos,
please do me a favor.

499
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:37,117
Okay.

500
00:36:55,576 --> 00:36:58,950
Kin, I know that
you miss Ka-wei very much,

501
00:36:59,492 --> 00:37:02,444
but Ka-wei got her own ideas
and arrangements.

502
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:06,075
She tried the best to give you warm
and surprise after her death.

503
00:37:07,576 --> 00:37:10,867
Maybe it is better
to keep patient and wait,

504
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,902
then you can success her wills.

505
00:37:12,992 --> 00:37:14,367
Is that a better idea?

506
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,610
But, husband.

507
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,659
I kind of regret it now,

508
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,492
I didn't feel anything wrong
and having no pain today.

509
00:37:26,783 --> 00:37:29,367
Actually, I should come here
with you by my side.

510
00:37:29,742 --> 00:37:32,034
Because it is so beautiful here,

511
00:37:32,326 --> 00:37:36,075
just like the time
when we had our first date.

512
00:37:39,242 --> 00:37:40,860
But, husband.

513
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,825
I kind of regret it now,

514
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,618
I didn't feel anything wrong
and having no pain today.

515
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:48,534
Actually, I should come here
with you by my side.

516
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,909
Because it is so beautiful here,

517
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:55,534
just like the time
when we had our first date.

518
00:37:58,742 --> 00:38:00,576
Because it is so beautiful here,

519
00:38:01,825 --> 00:38:05,576
just like the time
when we had our first date.

520
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:14,693
Hi, Auntie Yam.

521
00:38:14,783 --> 00:38:15,783
Hey, Kin.

522
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,492
How have you been recently?

523
00:38:18,867 --> 00:38:19,861
What?

524
00:38:20,284 --> 00:38:21,777
Something in urgency?

525
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:23,867
Okay, see me in the shop.

526
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,367
Kin, what is the urgency?

527
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:48,909
Auntie Yam, may I ask if you can
communicate with dead people?

528
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:54,992
Sure, I really get the power.

529
00:38:55,699 --> 00:39:01,034
But wait, who and who
are going to communicate?

530
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:07,159
You miss Ka-wei really much, right?

531
00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:10,742
Yes, I do really miss her.

532
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:16,825
Well, the case is,

533
00:39:17,075 --> 00:39:21,284
it will disturb their reincarnation
if you communicate with the death.

534
00:39:22,034 --> 00:39:26,409
The impact is too big and so,

535
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:28,950
so don't think about that.

536
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:32,117
Auntie Yam,

537
00:39:32,492 --> 00:39:35,027
Ka-wei got many incomplete wishes.

538
00:39:35,117 --> 00:39:36,700
And she still got many to tell me.

539
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:38,659
Could you help me?

540
00:39:51,783 --> 00:39:54,409
How is it? Don't kneel.

541
00:39:55,742 --> 00:39:57,409
Unless you will help me.

542
00:40:02,825 --> 00:40:04,909
I hate being threatened.

543
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,610
"Declaration of Love"

544
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,242
"Answering"

545
00:41:07,783 --> 00:41:08,825
Husband.

546
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,609
Here comes another video,

547
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:15,242
I hoped that
you will not feel annoying.

548
00:41:31,451 --> 00:41:32,700
Husband.

549
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:38,783
Wife.

550
00:41:41,992 --> 00:41:42,986
Husband.

551
00:41:45,242 --> 00:41:46,236
Wife.

552
00:41:58,909 --> 00:42:00,159
Husband.

553
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:02,576
How can it be?

554
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,950
Honey, you are so clever.

555
00:42:08,783 --> 00:42:10,663
Fortunately, you left me
lots of video messages.

556
00:42:11,867 --> 00:42:15,367
And auntie Yam gave me
the talisman that can call back you,

557
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,700
we can meet again from now on.

558
00:42:19,742 --> 00:42:26,659
I am so glad that we can
still have mid-autumn together.

559
00:42:28,825 --> 00:42:29,819
Not only that,

560
00:42:30,034 --> 00:42:33,618
but also Christmas, New Year
and our wedding anniversary,

561
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,117
plus both birthday of us too.

562
00:42:36,825 --> 00:42:37,909
Really?

563
00:42:38,992 --> 00:42:41,867
Sure, we can always meet again.

564
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:44,326
I miss you so much.

565
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:48,867
I really miss you too.

566
00:43:01,284 --> 00:43:03,284
Hi boss, take a rest.

567
00:43:03,909 --> 00:43:06,534
- Want to have some foods?
- Good idea, I just feel exhausted.

568
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:10,659
Just you? Where is your assistant?

569
00:43:11,326 --> 00:43:13,950
He said the work is too hard
and quitted yesterday.

570
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:17,392
So, are you going to hire somebody?

571
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:20,492
Yes, but nobody apply yet.

572
00:43:22,992 --> 00:43:24,492
Okay, how about me?

573
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:25,944
You?

574
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,200
Why?

575
00:43:30,576 --> 00:43:32,896
Yesterday Ka-wei accompanied me
in the Mid-Autumn festival.

576
00:43:33,326 --> 00:43:34,451
Ka-wei?

577
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:38,277
Her footages accompanied me
in the Mid-Autumn festival.

578
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:41,950
I go to get the forks.

579
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:44,903
Ling.

580
00:43:46,409 --> 00:43:50,326
Ka-wei told me before that you have
invited her to join your business,

581
00:43:51,034 --> 00:43:52,618
actually she got interest.

582
00:43:53,492 --> 00:43:57,069
Also, I can only survive
with her videos

583
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:58,367
during this period.

584
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:00,361
I am impressed with your business,

585
00:44:00,451 --> 00:44:01,576
it helps people.

586
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:05,402
So, I want to join.

587
00:44:05,492 --> 00:44:08,909
Great, I appreciated that.

588
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,409
Why?

589
00:44:12,409 --> 00:44:14,609
This is a meaningful business,

590
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:16,402
but I am really exhausted.

591
00:44:16,492 --> 00:44:19,117
Ka-wei told she would like to join,

592
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:20,361
so...

593
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,486
It will be perfect
if you can succeed her.

594
00:44:23,576 --> 00:44:24,742
Welcome.

595
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:37,200
Husband, do you remember that we...

596
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:38,653
Husband.

597
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:40,028
We...

598
00:44:40,867 --> 00:44:42,618
I am sorry, I am so nervous.

599
00:44:43,534 --> 00:44:44,361
It is okay,

600
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:47,200
many people nervous liked you
when facing camera.

601
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,569
May I suggest we go aside

602
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:50,735
and let you practice alone?

603
00:44:50,825 --> 00:44:52,528
Tell me when you are ready.

604
00:44:52,618 --> 00:44:55,825
Nice and thank you...

605
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:03,902
Husband, I am sorry.

606
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,992
I am really nervous and excited.

607
00:45:06,492 --> 00:45:09,319
Sorry for my cousin's
terrible performance.

608
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:10,277
It costs you extra time

609
00:45:10,367 --> 00:45:11,700
even for just a simple filming.

610
00:45:11,825 --> 00:45:12,652
No problem,

611
00:45:12,742 --> 00:45:16,699
many people get such camera phobia.

612
00:45:17,117 --> 00:45:19,159
May I suggest that
we get dinner together?

613
00:45:19,576 --> 00:45:22,534
As if for the compensating
of our foolish performance.

614
00:45:22,992 --> 00:45:25,693
Oh no, I got paid.

615
00:45:25,783 --> 00:45:26,902
That is our service and my duty.

616
00:45:26,992 --> 00:45:31,451
That means we can only make business
but not friends?

617
00:45:32,117 --> 00:45:33,451
That's not what I mean.

618
00:45:33,867 --> 00:45:34,742
Okay, may I suggest this?

619
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:36,277
You may come to my office
2 days later

620
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:37,735
and have a look of the editing.

621
00:45:37,825 --> 00:45:39,659
Great, I have your words.

622
00:45:40,492 --> 00:45:42,451
"Declaration of Love"

623
00:45:47,576 --> 00:45:48,700
Husband.

624
00:45:49,034 --> 00:45:51,152
Are you happy that
receiving my videos?

625
00:45:51,242 --> 00:45:52,236
"Lee Hui Ka-wei"

626
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:56,699
- Husband.
- Wife.

627
00:45:57,534 --> 00:46:00,699
I have waited for your video
a very long time.

628
00:46:01,409 --> 00:46:03,652
It would be great if you
had make the video day after day.

629
00:46:03,742 --> 00:46:05,659
If so, we could meet everyday.

630
00:46:06,034 --> 00:46:07,159
Husband,

631
00:46:09,576 --> 00:46:10,909
I have think about it.

632
00:46:13,117 --> 00:46:14,783
I cannot be so selfish.

633
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,825
How come of selfish?

634
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:20,367
I know you miss me,

635
00:46:20,783 --> 00:46:24,699
but in reality, I have passed away.

636
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,867
You still get your own life

637
00:46:28,909 --> 00:46:30,319
and can't be liked this forever.

638
00:46:30,409 --> 00:46:34,534
Wife, I know what I am doing.

639
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:37,451
I really need you!

640
00:46:38,992 --> 00:46:42,027
Unless you are not
willing to see me.

641
00:46:42,117 --> 00:46:44,034
No, I want to see you so much.

642
00:46:54,492 --> 00:46:55,659
You wait for me here.

643
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,783
Hurry up, is it okay?

644
00:47:26,284 --> 00:47:27,783
Problem occurs.

645
00:47:39,242 --> 00:47:40,700
It smells very good.

646
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:43,075
- Make you one also?
- Good idea.

647
00:47:44,618 --> 00:47:46,618
How about we get off work
earlier tonight?

648
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:49,618
May I suggest we go
to have a movie together.

649
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:52,985
- Hi.
- Have a seat first.

650
00:47:53,075 --> 00:47:54,069
Alright.

651
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,069
Hi, glad to see you here.

652
00:47:58,159 --> 00:47:59,992
Yes, I have a date with Kin.

653
00:48:00,117 --> 00:48:02,110
But he is still busy.

654
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,618
I see, is that for Miss Wong?
Let me do that.

655
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,576
Okay, I can make that.

656
00:48:07,909 --> 00:48:10,236
No way, how can you
let a girl awaiting you?

657
00:48:10,326 --> 00:48:11,726
Plus, she is such a beautiful girl.

658
00:48:13,534 --> 00:48:14,783
You misunderstood that.

659
00:48:15,618 --> 00:48:18,242
It is Friday night, go and have fun.

660
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:21,284
Then we leave now.

661
00:48:23,242 --> 00:48:24,242
Bye-bye.

662
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,152
Don't work too hard.

663
00:48:30,242 --> 00:48:32,367
Okay, just go.

664
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,117
"Movie Ticket"

665
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:54,451
May I suggest you
come on in my home?

666
00:48:55,618 --> 00:48:58,361
Nice, but I have to hurry
for a proposal.

667
00:48:58,451 --> 00:49:00,409
Okay, I get it.

668
00:49:02,825 --> 00:49:05,326
May I see you again?

669
00:49:06,034 --> 00:49:08,194
It sounds like you have
to gain my permission first.

670
00:49:08,284 --> 00:49:09,451
So, is that a yes?

671
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:13,409
- Sure, I call you after my trip.
- Great.

672
00:49:15,117 --> 00:49:18,075
I have your words,
so don't lie to me.

673
00:49:18,992 --> 00:49:21,659
- Sure, bye.
- Bye.

674
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,075
"Declaration of Love"

675
00:50:09,284 --> 00:50:10,576
You have to promise me

676
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:21,367
that you will never fall in love
with another woman anymore.

677
00:50:34,742 --> 00:50:36,075
You have to promise me

678
00:50:37,825 --> 00:50:44,950
that you will never fall in love
with another woman anymore.

679
00:50:46,075 --> 00:50:50,034
Or, I will take revenge.

680
00:50:50,992 --> 00:50:52,742
I will take revenge on you both.

681
00:51:16,284 --> 00:51:19,825
Help, help, is anybody here?

682
00:51:45,576 --> 00:51:47,319
You can just phone me
and I take it to the office.

683
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:48,486
You didn't bother to come here.

684
00:51:48,576 --> 00:51:50,402
Okay, it is in urgency.

685
00:51:50,492 --> 00:51:51,699
Take this one.

686
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,742
Thanks.

687
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:58,451
Okay.

688
00:51:59,034 --> 00:52:01,618
It seems you and Pik
have come together, right?

689
00:52:04,742 --> 00:52:09,700
Actually,
I am not well prepared yet.

690
00:52:11,242 --> 00:52:13,326
I want to clarify with her recently,

691
00:52:13,492 --> 00:52:14,932
but I cannot approach her
these days.

692
00:52:17,117 --> 00:52:20,534
Oh, today is 18th already?

693
00:52:20,867 --> 00:52:24,652
It is your first quarrel anniversary
with Ka-wei.

694
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:25,992
Did you get the video mail?

695
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,242
Yes, but it cannot be opened.

696
00:52:29,284 --> 00:52:30,451
Let me see.

697
00:52:32,534 --> 00:52:34,242
- I get some drinks for you.
- Thanks.

698
00:52:40,534 --> 00:52:43,075
Oh no, the file was damaged.

699
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:47,742
Let me try to recover it.

700
00:52:48,242 --> 00:52:49,992
Alright, take it easy.

701
00:52:51,742 --> 00:52:54,652
You know what?

702
00:52:54,742 --> 00:52:56,361
Ka-wei was specially sweet
when we was filming this video.

703
00:52:56,451 --> 00:52:57,909
You must have a look.

704
00:53:00,867 --> 00:53:03,492
Ling, I have thought about this.

705
00:53:04,409 --> 00:53:07,451
I just can't rely on these videos
for the rest of my life.

706
00:53:08,242 --> 00:53:11,783
Maybe Ka-wei will get the same idea

707
00:53:12,534 --> 00:53:15,367
that letting me back to
a much normal and easy life.

708
00:53:18,992 --> 00:53:20,117
I am so sorry.

709
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:24,618
You look so pretty
for without the glasses.

710
00:53:25,117 --> 00:53:26,700
How can you still make fun of me?

711
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:32,159
Ling,

712
00:53:33,867 --> 00:53:37,451
the client wants
a background music from the 60's.

713
00:53:38,451 --> 00:53:40,326
60's?

714
00:53:41,825 --> 00:53:43,367
Sealed with a Kiss?

715
00:54:04,034 --> 00:54:05,534
Did I fixed that lamp yet?

716
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:08,027
- No, it is still on that table.
- No.

717
00:54:08,117 --> 00:54:09,444
We just bought it recently.

718
00:54:09,534 --> 00:54:10,894
Alright, I will have a look at it.

719
00:54:48,075 --> 00:54:49,069
Let me help.

720
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:56,139
Just learn about how I deal with it.

721
00:54:58,326 --> 00:54:59,367
Thank you.

722
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,242
Do you get appointment
on Christmas eve?

723
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:05,361
No.

724
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:06,819
May we have dinner together?

725
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:10,699
Yes.

726
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:18,909
Thanks.

727
00:55:20,742 --> 00:55:22,902
So, is there any...

728
00:55:22,992 --> 00:55:26,034
No, you are
really beautiful tonight.

729
00:55:26,783 --> 00:55:27,909
Thanks.

730
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:36,909
Husband, Merry Christmas.

731
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:40,742
Who you are with now?

732
00:55:41,992 --> 00:55:44,451
It is okay, you may watch it first.

733
00:55:45,783 --> 00:55:48,783
No, I have make a decision

734
00:55:49,742 --> 00:55:51,284
that I should start my new life.

735
00:55:52,534 --> 00:55:55,069
On the other hand,
I should not date with you here,

736
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:57,242
but the heart
is with another girl there.

737
00:55:58,742 --> 00:56:01,492
However, do you think you can
really take easy with Ka-wei?

738
00:56:03,825 --> 00:56:06,200
She will in my heart forever.

739
00:56:08,034 --> 00:56:12,659
But now, I want to start my new life
with the girl I love.

740
00:56:13,576 --> 00:56:14,699
Here.

741
00:56:15,326 --> 00:56:17,075
Cheers...

742
00:56:25,326 --> 00:56:31,909
"Restaurant"

743
00:56:38,367 --> 00:56:39,367
Hi, Mandy.

744
00:56:39,659 --> 00:56:40,902
Hi, Mr Lee.

745
00:56:40,992 --> 00:56:45,992
I cannot approach Pik for long time,
how is she?

746
00:56:46,867 --> 00:56:48,159
Oh, so you don't know about it?

747
00:56:48,326 --> 00:56:51,735
We could not approach her
for a while about 6 months ago,

748
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,194
then we went to her home.

749
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,110
What we discovered that was,

750
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,027
she wounded her face terribly
and stitched her mouth

751
00:56:59,117 --> 00:57:00,742
who just lost her mind.

752
00:57:01,075 --> 00:57:02,659
She is still in the mental hospital.

753
00:57:08,075 --> 00:57:10,985
Husband, it is my birthday today.

754
00:57:11,075 --> 00:57:12,992
Can you accompany me
to a special place?

755
00:57:14,534 --> 00:57:18,783
Sure, but may I ask you
a question first?

756
00:57:19,075 --> 00:57:20,326
Of course.

757
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:29,867
Do you know this girl?

758
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:32,075
Negative.

759
00:57:37,783 --> 00:57:39,451
Then, can you help me to find out

760
00:57:40,992 --> 00:57:45,700
why had this girl wound
her face so badly?

761
00:57:47,034 --> 00:57:48,659
Stitche her own mouth

762
00:57:50,825 --> 00:57:53,992
and loss her mind.

763
00:57:54,825 --> 00:57:59,699
Maybe this is a retribution
that she has done something bad.

764
00:58:01,534 --> 00:58:02,909
I don't want to talk about her.

765
00:58:11,242 --> 00:58:12,825
When I saw her in the hospital,

766
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,367
ehe felt terribly scared
once she heard my voice.

767
00:58:18,117 --> 00:58:19,997
She kept on saying
that she won't do that again,

768
00:58:21,783 --> 00:58:23,867
and asked for my wife's forgiveness.

769
00:58:25,992 --> 00:58:31,242
Actually you know everything,
why still ask me?

770
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:35,534
I want you to tell me
that wasn't done by you.

771
00:58:37,909 --> 00:58:39,242
Yes, it is me.

772
00:58:42,659 --> 00:58:44,200
She and me are merely friends.

773
00:58:45,867 --> 00:58:47,860
Actually, she wanted more.

774
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:49,110
So, that why you hurt her?

775
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,534
Can we stop conflict
regarding that girl?

776
00:58:52,284 --> 00:58:53,618
I should not recall you.

777
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:56,534
You were not my wife.

778
00:59:01,699 --> 00:59:05,159
Tell me
if you fall in love with Ling?

779
00:59:07,659 --> 00:59:09,326
We are merely friends.

780
00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:16,409
Aren't you going to hurt Ling.

781
00:59:16,659 --> 00:59:18,034
She is your good friend.

782
00:59:18,992 --> 00:59:20,451
I don't think so.

783
00:59:21,492 --> 00:59:23,612
Or else, she won't trying
to steal my husband from me.

784
00:59:24,075 --> 00:59:26,618
Are you crazy?
We are really merely friends.

785
00:59:27,992 --> 00:59:30,700
We can get an answer soon.

786
00:59:31,992 --> 00:59:34,284
- Hi.
- Ling.

787
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:36,034
Yes?

788
00:59:36,992 --> 00:59:40,783
I want to know that
if you do love me.

789
00:59:42,992 --> 00:59:47,200
I want to ensure our future,
can you tell me?

790
00:59:49,742 --> 00:59:56,075
Kin, I love you.

791
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:58,284
Thank you, Ling.

792
00:59:58,699 --> 00:59:59,992
Good friend?

793
01:00:00,576 --> 01:00:03,659
Fine, just another girl
trying to steal you..

794
01:00:06,992 --> 01:00:08,659
Don't you want to hurt her.

795
01:00:09,909 --> 01:00:12,618
She is your best friend,
you can't hurt Ling.

796
01:00:14,034 --> 01:00:15,576
I won't see you again
if you hurt her.

797
01:00:17,742 --> 01:00:23,367
Is there any difference?
You don't love me any more.

798
01:00:27,618 --> 01:00:31,825
For what I lost, no other can take.

799
01:00:44,699 --> 01:00:45,610
Husband,

800
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:49,367
we got marry for 6 months.

801
01:00:50,034 --> 01:00:51,326
You have to promise me

802
01:00:52,034 --> 01:00:56,326
that you will never fall in love
with another woman anymore.

803
01:00:56,825 --> 01:00:59,618
Otherwise, my heart would be broken.

804
01:01:11,825 --> 01:01:12,819
Hi.

805
01:01:13,117 --> 01:01:15,200
- Ling, where are you?
- In office.

806
01:01:16,034 --> 01:01:19,693
Do not open any
of Ka-wei's video files,

807
01:01:19,783 --> 01:01:20,783
I come back now.

808
01:01:21,034 --> 01:01:24,200
What is that? What do you mean?

809
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:45,819
I try my best now

810
01:01:45,909 --> 01:01:47,825
to defend and slow down Ka-wei.

811
01:01:58,159 --> 01:01:59,069
Husband.

812
01:01:59,159 --> 01:02:00,742
You have to promise me

813
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:05,742
that you will never fall in love
with another woman anymore.

814
01:02:05,867 --> 01:02:06,861
Otherwise...

815
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:08,909
I will take revenge.

816
01:02:09,783 --> 01:02:11,492
I will take revenge on both of you.

817
01:02:17,618 --> 01:02:19,451
I was so stupid that
made you my best friend,

818
01:02:19,909 --> 01:02:22,909
You tended to steal my husband
once I've just gone.

819
01:02:23,367 --> 01:02:24,618
No, I didn't.

820
01:02:56,618 --> 01:03:00,950
Auntie Yam, is that you?

821
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:04,534
Why do you come across this affair?

822
01:03:05,034 --> 01:03:06,909
It was because of me

823
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,451
that you can still here.

824
01:03:10,742 --> 01:03:13,117
If so, please stay out of it,

825
01:03:14,742 --> 01:03:16,326
it is better for you
by caring no more.

826
01:03:16,699 --> 01:03:22,783
But you are now hurting others.

827
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:26,075
Auntie Yam.

828
01:03:27,576 --> 01:03:31,534
You treat me well when I was alive,

829
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:35,367
should we become enemy now?

830
01:03:36,618 --> 01:03:38,367
No, you just stop right now,

831
01:03:38,576 --> 01:03:42,200
and I will help you
for a good reincarnation.

832
01:03:42,534 --> 01:03:43,528
Is that okay?

833
01:03:45,451 --> 01:03:53,075
Auntie Yam,
did you ever truly love someone?

834
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,492
Yes.

835
01:03:56,492 --> 01:03:59,992
How much you can pay for the love?

836
01:04:00,451 --> 01:04:04,742
Everything, but not in your way.

837
01:04:05,451 --> 01:04:06,445
Indeed.

838
01:04:08,909 --> 01:04:10,034
Everything,

839
01:04:12,326 --> 01:04:14,159
including my life.

840
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:21,783
So, do you think
you can really trap me by this one?

841
01:04:41,326 --> 01:04:44,742
Nobody can help you now.

842
01:04:45,284 --> 01:04:46,492
Honey!

843
01:04:48,367 --> 01:04:49,909
Can you let go of Ling?

844
01:04:51,825 --> 01:04:53,659
You really fall in love with her?

845
01:04:57,742 --> 01:05:02,534
Honey, do you remember
we often played with a joke

846
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:05,992
that you would ask me
a bunch of questions.

847
01:05:07,867 --> 01:05:09,034
Yes.

848
01:05:13,742 --> 01:05:23,367
Who is the most beautiful woman
in this universe?

849
01:05:25,242 --> 01:05:28,783
No thinking and answer it at once.

850
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:31,451
It is my wife, it is you.

851
01:05:35,992 --> 01:05:37,242
No longer is, right?

852
01:05:41,492 --> 01:05:45,576
No, it is always postitve
in my mind.

853
01:05:47,742 --> 01:05:49,242
But,

854
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:55,867
you no longer love me.

855
01:06:02,618 --> 01:06:04,534
Originally, I think so.

856
01:06:05,492 --> 01:06:06,742
But once I see you cried,

857
01:06:07,742 --> 01:06:10,409
I realize that I love you only.

858
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:19,783
Wife, do you still remember
that I have promised

859
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:23,117
I won't let you sad?

860
01:06:25,699 --> 01:06:30,242
Yes.

861
01:06:31,867 --> 01:06:33,075
It is my fault.

862
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,576
I can't keep my word.

863
01:06:46,451 --> 01:06:47,825
I am coming to be with you.

864
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,618
Husband.

865
01:06:56,659 --> 01:06:58,367
Husband.

866
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,569
Husband, do you know what day is it?

867
01:07:12,659 --> 01:07:14,825
Right, the anniversary
of your proposal of marriage.

868
01:07:15,159 --> 01:07:17,742
You have to promise me
that you would love me forever

869
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,909
who never fall in love
with another woman anymore.

870
01:07:20,117 --> 01:07:22,909
Or, I will take revenge.

871
01:07:23,451 --> 01:07:25,950
I will take revenge on you
even if I died.

872
01:07:32,117 --> 01:07:33,944
"Miss Lee,"

873
01:07:34,034 --> 01:07:35,909
"sorry that
I won't take your business."

874
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:41,117
"Result"

875
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:45,236
"Chapter 3"

876
01:07:45,326 --> 01:07:47,610
"Fields means nothing,
and so do lands"

877
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,075
"None of the siblings
can escape karma"

878
01:07:54,492 --> 01:07:58,902
Bros, what the special
is of this soup?

879
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:01,409
Is it kidding? Nothing inside
but just pieces of melon.

880
01:08:01,909 --> 01:08:05,609
No kidding,
It is not just mere a soup.

881
01:08:05,699 --> 01:08:08,277
Many different
kinds of herbs inside,

882
01:08:08,367 --> 01:08:09,576
really good for health.

883
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:11,909
Really?

884
01:08:12,909 --> 01:08:14,618
So, what is the most
famous dish here?

885
01:08:15,326 --> 01:08:16,909
I will suggest shrimp balls,

886
01:08:17,242 --> 01:08:22,659
it composes of many
different kinds of shrimps.

887
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:26,783
I see, which will make you
laugh forever.

888
01:08:27,825 --> 01:08:30,242
What a bad joke,
even my son ignores it.

889
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,610
You can't imagine,

890
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:33,992
Ka-wei loves that.

891
01:08:35,117 --> 01:08:39,699
Right, you are going to marry soon.

892
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:41,699
Do you need my help?

893
01:08:43,326 --> 01:08:45,860
Sure, may I get your son?

894
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:47,034
I want a ring bearer.

895
01:08:47,618 --> 01:08:50,576
Sure, leave me
a big red packet then.

896
01:08:51,242 --> 01:08:55,618
What are these turtles for?
For myth believe?

897
01:08:56,492 --> 01:08:59,618
Those are good for health.

898
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:07,700
You want to eat that?

899
01:09:08,783 --> 01:09:10,700
All animals could be eaten.

900
01:09:13,992 --> 01:09:15,159
Do you really mean it?

901
01:09:15,409 --> 01:09:17,409
Of course, good for your body.

902
01:09:18,451 --> 01:09:19,742
Just trust me.

903
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,284
Your marriage is soon,
eat that without hesitation

904
01:09:22,618 --> 01:09:24,618
and you will get a child soon.

905
01:09:25,034 --> 01:09:27,825
It is mainly for the soup.
So, you must drink the soup.

906
01:09:29,159 --> 01:09:31,576
Well, Kei is late again.

907
01:09:32,117 --> 01:09:33,742
He is used to that.

908
01:09:34,492 --> 01:09:37,117
Among us, I am the only one
who mostly on time.

909
01:09:38,409 --> 01:09:41,110
You just did arrive earlier,
not on time.

910
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,194
Don't talk about this.

911
01:09:42,284 --> 01:09:46,783
Let me suggest,
the beef is also well famous here.

912
01:09:47,117 --> 01:09:49,909
Together with these wontons,
All are custom made for you.

913
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,110
Sure that you are the boss
of this restaurant,

914
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,800
but still no need to
overly promote that.

915
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:57,159
- Are there any oysters?
- Oh yes, got it.

916
01:09:57,534 --> 01:09:58,777
You are Mom's favor.

917
01:09:58,867 --> 01:10:00,069
Only you could have oysters
in the past,

918
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:02,742
while Kei and I could only
have radish and cheap foods.

919
01:10:03,618 --> 01:10:06,486
Mama only took you with her
when outing.

920
01:10:06,576 --> 01:10:09,576
Frankly, it was not mine,
but yours problem.

921
01:10:09,699 --> 01:10:12,194
It was because you were very
naughty, simply out of control.

922
01:10:12,284 --> 01:10:13,867
Kei was a good child, right?

923
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,534
But Mama never took him out.

924
01:10:16,284 --> 01:10:17,486
We couldn't just leave you
alone at home,

925
01:10:17,576 --> 01:10:19,783
somebody had to take care of you.

926
01:10:23,117 --> 01:10:24,242
Actually I knew that,

927
01:10:24,618 --> 01:10:28,159
Mama worried that
if all of us were out.

928
01:10:28,492 --> 01:10:30,117
Papa would then do bad things.

929
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:33,326
So, it was our duty to monitor Papa.

930
01:10:34,992 --> 01:10:36,528
Don't talk about this anymore.

931
01:10:36,618 --> 01:10:37,783
Cheers.

932
01:10:42,783 --> 01:10:44,825
Try this, very good.

933
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,825
I am so sorry for my late.

934
01:10:48,075 --> 01:10:50,194
It's okay, just 30 minutes.

935
01:10:50,284 --> 01:10:52,236
And hotpot dining
is flexible for waiting.

936
01:10:52,326 --> 01:10:53,944
The traffic was really terrible,

937
01:10:54,034 --> 01:10:55,735
I came by taxi immediately
after work.

938
01:10:55,825 --> 01:10:56,819
But roads were jammed,

939
01:10:56,909 --> 01:10:58,110
maybe it was better
that come by MTR.

940
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,444
Sure, I realized that,
so I took helicopter.

941
01:11:00,534 --> 01:11:01,486
But I could only just a bit earlier.

942
01:11:01,576 --> 01:11:03,194
Are you really kidding
with me like that?

943
01:11:03,284 --> 01:11:04,693
Don't bother with him.

944
01:11:04,783 --> 01:11:06,618
- Come here and sit!
- Sure!

945
01:11:18,867 --> 01:11:20,117
Don't save it.

946
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:29,011
How long do we meet
since previous time?

947
01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:31,992
3 months already.

948
01:11:33,034 --> 01:11:34,700
Really 3 months already?

949
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,034
You are so busy
that cannot feel that, right?

950
01:11:40,909 --> 01:11:42,075
Cheers.

951
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:51,825
Right, it is you turn
to take the order.

952
01:11:52,618 --> 01:11:54,110
There are already many dishes, why?

953
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,200
It should be enough then.

954
01:11:56,492 --> 01:11:58,932
Please take expensive dishes only.
The boss will pay for that.

955
01:11:59,034 --> 01:12:00,159
What boss?

956
01:12:00,699 --> 01:12:02,284
Chiu got shares here.

957
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:05,569
Congratulations, Chiu.
You are now the big boss.

958
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:06,652
Not big boss.

959
01:12:06,742 --> 01:12:08,528
Keung told me that
it will be a good business,

960
01:12:08,618 --> 01:12:10,992
and see if I will join as partners.

961
01:12:11,992 --> 01:12:14,609
So, we just go for
those expensive one.

962
01:12:14,699 --> 01:12:16,486
Don't those cheap dishes.

963
01:12:16,576 --> 01:12:17,819
Yes, we are my brothers.

964
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:19,069
Try to order as much as we can.

965
01:12:19,159 --> 01:12:20,319
I am going to kill you guys.

966
01:12:20,409 --> 01:12:22,034
Hi Boss,
here come the special order.

967
01:12:23,659 --> 01:12:25,576
Thanks, may you back to work.

968
01:12:27,742 --> 01:12:30,075
This is a very good
and special dish, have a look.

969
01:12:30,409 --> 01:12:32,367
Just frog. How come special?

970
01:12:33,867 --> 01:12:35,576
They are not for eaten,

971
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,242
I just want the urinate.

972
01:12:37,867 --> 01:12:38,950
How come?

973
01:12:39,867 --> 01:12:41,610
Good for man, you know?

974
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:43,159
You must taste it
and see the impact.

975
01:13:02,825 --> 01:13:05,409
So, do you still go
to the previous job?

976
01:13:05,909 --> 01:13:08,492
Why not? I still have to work hard.

977
01:13:08,742 --> 01:13:09,992
My family gets 3 members.

978
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,367
Your situation
is far better than mine,

979
01:13:12,534 --> 01:13:14,742
You are still single
and get an easy life.

980
01:13:15,034 --> 01:13:17,451
Just okay,
I think Kin is much better.

981
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:18,985
How could it be?

982
01:13:19,075 --> 01:13:20,635
Is there no need for me
to pay the rent?

983
01:13:20,867 --> 01:13:23,451
Do you know I have to earn a lot
to survive every month?

984
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:26,451
Unlike you can comfortably live
in the public housing.

985
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:29,985
Yeah, after sending Mama
to the elder's home,

986
01:13:30,075 --> 01:13:31,735
you can wholly occupy the unit.

987
01:13:31,825 --> 01:13:35,409
Just rent for a thousand something.
I envy that.

988
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:40,409
I went to see
Papa's gravestone months before,

989
01:13:40,618 --> 01:13:41,992
the color of graphic faded.

990
01:13:43,326 --> 01:13:45,576
What? That was impossible.

991
01:13:46,117 --> 01:13:48,576
I've gone before
and that was still in good shape.

992
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:53,034
You've been there?
Aren't you still angry with Papa?

993
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,242
Not that case.

994
01:13:54,492 --> 01:13:56,652
After meeting my client last month,

995
01:13:56,742 --> 01:13:58,992
I was just passing by
and have a look.

996
01:13:59,909 --> 01:14:02,075
Just passing by? Just have a look?

997
01:14:02,825 --> 01:14:06,783
Then, what was your purpose
to see Papa?

998
01:14:07,492 --> 01:14:08,742
Asked him for a bless?

999
01:14:09,159 --> 01:14:11,034
That you can earn money for nothing?

1000
01:14:11,783 --> 01:14:14,367
It is filial piety,
do you know that?

1001
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:20,659
I really went there.
The color was fading.

1002
01:14:20,783 --> 01:14:24,242
So I got some paints to fix that.

1003
01:14:26,451 --> 01:14:28,618
Kei, I appreciate that.

1004
01:14:29,825 --> 01:14:33,117
We can't change that
he really is our father.

1005
01:14:37,451 --> 01:14:40,783
Indeed, I was really angry with him.

1006
01:14:41,409 --> 01:14:43,909
Though he was rarely back home,

1007
01:14:44,326 --> 01:14:45,909
he always came with chaos.

1008
01:14:46,909 --> 01:14:48,699
Yes, you really scared.

1009
01:14:49,825 --> 01:14:51,409
Every time he came back, he drunk.

1010
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:55,034
So scared that I would hided inside
the blanket.

1011
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:58,242
Yeah, you would took me with you.

1012
01:14:58,409 --> 01:14:59,618
Yes, I really remembered that.

1013
01:15:00,451 --> 01:15:04,699
Yes, both you were cowards
at that time.

1014
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:06,444
Weren't you?

1015
01:15:06,534 --> 01:15:08,618
Yes, you always got
special response to Papa,

1016
01:15:08,992 --> 01:15:11,110
Papa would beat you hard
for your arguing with him.

1017
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,985
But why didn't you fight back?

1018
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:14,402
Let him knew what is martial arts.

1019
01:15:14,492 --> 01:15:17,985
Yes, Chiu really knew that,
but he applied it behind.

1020
01:15:18,075 --> 01:15:21,659
Whenever did Papa beat him hard,
he would held his fist tightly.

1021
01:15:21,992 --> 01:15:24,700
I really worried
he would fight back.

1022
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:27,693
As if they had fought
each other at that time,

1023
01:15:27,783 --> 01:15:28,950
we would help you for sure.

1024
01:15:29,699 --> 01:15:31,783
Why didn't us call police
at that time?

1025
01:15:32,534 --> 01:15:33,902
We did it once.

1026
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:36,367
When the cops came
and asked about it,

1027
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:37,860
Papa told them that

1028
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:40,618
he was just a bit serious
in teaching his sons.

1029
01:15:40,992 --> 01:15:42,492
So the cops asked Mama.

1030
01:15:42,867 --> 01:15:44,609
Madam, how is it?

1031
01:15:44,699 --> 01:15:47,451
Mama just repeated what Papa said,
"Nothing, but just a bit serious."

1032
01:15:47,825 --> 01:15:49,117
It was useless, no one can help.

1033
01:15:49,576 --> 01:15:51,284
Just enjoy our meal.

1034
01:15:52,699 --> 01:15:55,194
- Chiu?
- What's wrong?

1035
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:57,659
Why asking me?
What are you thinking now?

1036
01:15:57,950 --> 01:15:58,860
It is fine, nothing.

1037
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:00,902
Well, the soup is well done.

1038
01:16:00,992 --> 01:16:01,986
Let's have some now.

1039
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:04,902
- Enjoy.
- Let me have a taste first.

1040
01:16:04,992 --> 01:16:05,986
Great.

1041
01:16:06,451 --> 01:16:07,445
It seems good.

1042
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,409
- Have some more.
- It is good for you.

1043
01:16:14,534 --> 01:16:16,699
Kei, may I ask a question?

1044
01:16:17,075 --> 01:16:18,742
Sure, any without hesitation.

1045
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:22,783
How much you earn per month?

1046
01:16:26,075 --> 01:16:28,492
You said that without hesitation,
so don't you answer that?

1047
01:16:29,326 --> 01:16:31,034
Or he is calculating.

1048
01:16:32,242 --> 01:16:36,409
It is variable since my income
is based on commission.

1049
01:16:37,409 --> 01:16:40,367
What is the average?

1050
01:16:41,034 --> 01:16:42,242
Tens of thousands.

1051
01:16:42,659 --> 01:16:44,825
30 thousands, 50 thousands
or 80 thousands?

1052
01:16:46,117 --> 01:16:50,742
About 50 thousands to 60 thousands,
but not a stable sum.

1053
01:16:50,992 --> 01:16:53,742
Yeah, really good though.

1054
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:57,242
You are still single
and there is not any family burden,

1055
01:16:57,659 --> 01:16:58,902
while the rent per month
of public housing

1056
01:16:58,992 --> 01:17:00,528
is just a thousand something.

1057
01:17:00,618 --> 01:17:03,402
It is far better than
I got my own family,

1058
01:17:03,492 --> 01:17:05,034
while making only 30 thousands
a month.

1059
01:17:05,825 --> 01:17:06,950
30 thousands?

1060
01:17:07,909 --> 01:17:09,367
I can only make 20 thousands,

1061
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:11,992
yet half of that
is spent for the rent.

1062
01:17:12,451 --> 01:17:16,409
Plus I have to contribute
to the expenses of Mom's elder home.

1063
01:17:16,867 --> 01:17:19,618
It is just amazing that
I do not get any debts.

1064
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:22,236
Sure you are amazing
and better than me.

1065
01:17:22,326 --> 01:17:25,909
You still young, you must have
a better future than me.

1066
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,659
By the way,
what do you do right now?

1067
01:17:31,992 --> 01:17:33,576
Aren't you changing the topic?

1068
01:17:34,034 --> 01:17:35,659
I still get many to ask.

1069
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:37,242
Me too.

1070
01:17:47,783 --> 01:17:50,117
Why do you suddenly
get interest on me?

1071
01:17:50,867 --> 01:17:52,409
I get nothing change
for these years,

1072
01:17:52,618 --> 01:17:54,699
why do you so curious on me?

1073
01:17:55,659 --> 01:17:56,783
Just for update.

1074
01:17:57,326 --> 01:17:59,409
And, may I ask that...

1075
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:02,742
The elder home for Mama
is chosen by you, right?

1076
01:18:03,117 --> 01:18:04,576
Why is it so expensive?

1077
01:18:05,409 --> 01:18:07,985
When did you see her the last time?

1078
01:18:08,075 --> 01:18:10,027
Can you answer my question first?

1079
01:18:10,117 --> 01:18:11,867
Yes, you should answer first.

1080
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:15,569
I got my reason.

1081
01:18:15,659 --> 01:18:19,242
Though, I can still answer
that question first.

1082
01:18:24,284 --> 01:18:27,319
Mom has lived in this elder home
for nearly 6 months,

1083
01:18:27,409 --> 01:18:29,367
I go to visit her every week.

1084
01:18:30,075 --> 01:18:31,528
Before going in the elder home,

1085
01:18:31,618 --> 01:18:35,027
her body was not good
and even getting worse then.

1086
01:18:35,117 --> 01:18:37,152
And I am much busy than before

1087
01:18:37,242 --> 01:18:38,682
that I just cannot take care of her.

1088
01:18:40,451 --> 01:18:44,492
We knew that
since we got the same situation.

1089
01:18:45,326 --> 01:18:47,528
At that time, I have visited
so many o elder homes,

1090
01:18:47,618 --> 01:18:50,159
and did many researches of them too.

1091
01:18:50,534 --> 01:18:54,027
Finally, considering in all manners,

1092
01:18:54,117 --> 01:18:56,159
I thought this one was the best.

1093
01:18:56,992 --> 01:18:58,735
The charges is a bit expensive,

1094
01:18:58,825 --> 01:19:02,451
but I did ask you before
and there was not any opposition.

1095
01:19:02,783 --> 01:19:03,992
No opposition

1096
01:19:04,534 --> 01:19:06,284
does not mean I am agreeing on this.

1097
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,950
I thought there were options,

1098
01:19:09,367 --> 01:19:11,486
but you finalized that
just two days afterward.

1099
01:19:11,576 --> 01:19:14,136
And you only notice us after all
those procedures were completed,

1100
01:19:14,659 --> 01:19:16,451
should I take Mama away then?

1101
01:19:17,451 --> 01:19:18,534
So, Chiu?

1102
01:19:23,451 --> 01:19:25,326
I also thought there were options,

1103
01:19:25,909 --> 01:19:27,652
but you had fixed that all.

1104
01:19:27,742 --> 01:19:30,242
What could I do?
I could only accept that.

1105
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:35,326
I have to contribute
5 thousands per month...

1106
01:19:38,367 --> 01:19:40,610
It is not a problem for you
since you make 50s per month.

1107
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:44,451
I can't join any of gathering
or activities with my friends,

1108
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:50,742
and I rarely get meals
at restaurant.

1109
01:19:52,659 --> 01:19:54,609
You can tell me
if you get difficulty.

1110
01:19:54,699 --> 01:19:56,069
No need to get angry liked this.

1111
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,492
Did he get angry?

1112
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:03,034
Chiu is also difficult
with this five-thousands burden.

1113
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,194
Do you want some more beers, boss?

1114
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:23,534
No need, thanks.

1115
01:20:35,242 --> 01:20:36,492
Kei, frankly speaking,

1116
01:20:38,075 --> 01:20:41,867
I really get a difficult life,

1117
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,075
and I cannot save even a dollar.

1118
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:50,409
Also, the investment
on this business

1119
01:20:51,242 --> 01:20:52,867
was my wife's own pocket money.

1120
01:20:53,742 --> 01:20:54,736
Chiu,

1121
01:20:55,492 --> 01:20:57,742
I will not know
if you don't tell me.

1122
01:20:57,909 --> 01:21:02,242
Should I disclose all of
my difficulties to other people.

1123
01:21:02,659 --> 01:21:03,735
However, we are brothers,

1124
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:05,825
so just be frank is all right.

1125
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:16,326
Well, I am not so easy
as you think too.

1126
01:21:16,742 --> 01:21:20,402
I lost a lot in the stock market
3 years ago,

1127
01:21:20,492 --> 01:21:23,284
I am now still paying the debts.

1128
01:21:25,492 --> 01:21:29,117
Kei, are you worrying
I will ask you for money?

1129
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:30,444
I think you over interpret that,

1130
01:21:30,534 --> 01:21:33,950
I just want to share
with you my real status.

1131
01:21:35,825 --> 01:21:39,326
Will you give
if I really ask you for money?

1132
01:21:40,492 --> 01:21:43,825
It depends.
I can give only a certain amount

1133
01:21:44,242 --> 01:21:45,825
What is a certain amount?

1134
01:21:46,284 --> 01:21:48,659
Tell me what actually you want?

1135
01:21:49,492 --> 01:21:51,277
I am just curious about
the certain amount,

1136
01:21:51,367 --> 01:21:52,902
what actually that is?

1137
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:55,117
One thousands or three thousands?

1138
01:21:55,992 --> 01:21:57,618
Much more than that.

1139
01:21:58,576 --> 01:22:01,236
Then what is that?
Ten thousands or thirty thousands?

1140
01:22:01,326 --> 01:22:03,825
I can afford ten thousands.

1141
01:22:04,867 --> 01:22:07,152
Kei, don't be nervous,

1142
01:22:07,242 --> 01:22:10,284
I will not ask money from you.

1143
01:22:11,867 --> 01:22:15,451
Yes, don't be worry.

1144
01:22:16,825 --> 01:22:20,492
I really want to see each other
with this gathering only.

1145
01:22:21,659 --> 01:22:23,659
Chiu, told me
and see if I could help.

1146
01:22:24,451 --> 01:22:26,492
You heard before that

1147
01:22:27,159 --> 01:22:29,618
our life are really quite difficult.

1148
01:22:30,576 --> 01:22:31,570
For me,

1149
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:35,867
I am almost 50 and hardly
get any promotion in my career.

1150
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:38,693
Wages up for only
few hundreds per year.

1151
01:22:38,783 --> 01:22:41,867
If my child is going
to study oversea,

1152
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:45,326
I just have to pay for that.

1153
01:22:45,909 --> 01:22:48,486
But, could I manage that?

1154
01:22:48,576 --> 01:22:50,492
Chiu, what do you want actually?

1155
01:22:50,825 --> 01:22:57,117
We want to discuss with you,
we want to minimize expenditures.

1156
01:22:58,242 --> 01:22:59,367
You mean...

1157
01:23:00,242 --> 01:23:05,618
For example,
the cost of the elder home and so.

1158
01:23:05,909 --> 01:23:07,985
Indeed, regarding the elder home...

1159
01:23:08,075 --> 01:23:11,200
Indeed, that is really expensive.

1160
01:23:11,451 --> 01:23:14,783
Added up with the other charges,
I have to pay 7 thousands per month.

1161
01:23:15,451 --> 01:23:17,944
If we change to another one,

1162
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:21,534
we could save only about
one thousand

1163
01:23:21,867 --> 01:23:23,159
which is meaningless.

1164
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,783
Kei, don't you think
there is really no option?

1165
01:23:29,699 --> 01:23:33,451
Options? Should there is any option?

1166
01:23:35,075 --> 01:23:36,069
Other options?

1167
01:23:36,451 --> 01:23:37,618
I want to know too.

1168
01:23:38,618 --> 01:23:41,178
I have discussed with Kin for
long time, but still get no option.

1169
01:23:41,992 --> 01:23:45,909
Kei, she is our mother,

1170
01:23:46,618 --> 01:23:49,367
and I really want to know your idea
that how to treat our mother.

1171
01:23:50,284 --> 01:23:54,534
The grant from the government
has reached the limit.

1172
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,159
Then, how much do you want
to contribute per month?

1173
01:24:11,117 --> 01:24:14,618
Oh I see, you want to
take Mama out of the elder home.

1174
01:24:15,867 --> 01:24:17,618
So, whom will Mom be with?
You or you?

1175
01:24:18,909 --> 01:24:22,700
Chiu, can mother
be with your son in the same room?

1176
01:24:23,534 --> 01:24:26,659
Of course not,
the room is just too small.

1177
01:24:26,909 --> 01:24:29,361
And my wife gets many works to do,

1178
01:24:29,451 --> 01:24:30,609
she cannot take care of mother.

1179
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:32,367
Have you ever think it carefully?

1180
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:35,950
Don't you look at me.

1181
01:24:36,409 --> 01:24:39,825
My home just gets 200 feet square
and full of things,

1182
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,534
it is not suitable for elder.

1183
01:24:42,075 --> 01:24:45,159
Kei, have you ever think
carefully before?

1184
01:24:45,783 --> 01:24:48,152
The best solution is
fot mother to be with you again.

1185
01:24:48,242 --> 01:24:49,609
Originally, she was with you

1186
01:24:49,699 --> 01:24:51,159
and you took good care of her.

1187
01:24:51,451 --> 01:24:55,451
Plus, the public housing
is under her name.

1188
01:24:55,783 --> 01:24:59,367
Honest speaking, you have taken
the advantage for long time.

1189
01:24:59,742 --> 01:25:02,576
Ok, I will be with Mom in my home.

1190
01:25:03,867 --> 01:25:04,860
No, it is not your home,

1191
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:06,609
but she goes back to her home.

1192
01:25:06,699 --> 01:25:07,867
I got it.

1193
01:25:08,742 --> 01:25:11,075
Mom will be with me in her home,
do you satisfy now?

1194
01:25:11,659 --> 01:25:12,653
Good,

1195
01:25:13,159 --> 01:25:14,439
it is great that you understand.

1196
01:25:18,699 --> 01:25:19,867
Finally we get the consent,

1197
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:23,034
and we can celebrate with this.

1198
01:25:26,367 --> 01:25:29,034
What a good wine,
so let me go to the rest room first.

1199
01:25:29,618 --> 01:25:31,444
Clean my body up,
so I can totally absorb it.

1200
01:25:31,534 --> 01:25:32,361
Okay?

1201
01:25:32,451 --> 01:25:34,950
Fantastic...

1202
01:28:38,409 --> 01:28:42,034
How come now? It is so chaotic.

1203
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:44,992
Try to clean it up.

1204
01:28:47,534 --> 01:28:49,034
I didn't get chopsticks too.

1205
01:29:12,992 --> 01:29:15,284
- And no beers.
- I go and get that.

1206
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:26,409
Why did you stop taking medicines?

1207
01:29:28,451 --> 01:29:29,700
Because I can't sleep then.

1208
01:29:31,451 --> 01:29:33,691
So can you fall as sleep
after stop taking the medicines?

1209
01:29:37,159 --> 01:29:38,999
Yeah, stop taking them
and I can finally sleep,

1210
01:29:40,742 --> 01:29:42,242
but still having dreams every night.

1211
01:29:44,492 --> 01:29:46,326
Are those the same dreams as before?

1212
01:29:47,326 --> 01:29:49,409
I dreamed about my last wife

1213
01:29:51,034 --> 01:29:52,534
who then becoming a ghost

1214
01:29:54,534 --> 01:29:56,034
and came back for killing.

1215
01:29:59,409 --> 01:30:01,169
Then, I also dream about
my big brother and I

1216
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:05,075
attempted to kill our mother
and my second brother.

1217
01:30:05,825 --> 01:30:07,609
But, your record said that
you never have been married before,

1218
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:09,326
neither you have any siblings too.

1219
01:30:11,117 --> 01:30:14,326
Well, the most important thing now
is for you to relax and take a rest,

1220
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:16,528
Those medicines are here to help,

1221
01:30:16,618 --> 01:30:17,610
you just can't stop taking them
whenever you want.

1222
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,075
Please believe in me.

1223
01:30:20,492 --> 01:30:23,409
Also, you may try going to work
if it is possible to do so.

1224
01:30:24,367 --> 01:30:25,361
Doctor Chan.

1225
01:30:27,284 --> 01:30:29,284
I dreamed about you last night too.

1226
01:30:29,867 --> 01:30:32,569
About me?

1227
01:30:32,659 --> 01:30:33,867
May I know about it?

1228
01:30:35,576 --> 01:30:37,534
We have had the same apps,

1229
01:30:38,867 --> 01:30:41,242
called the Declaration of Love.

1230
01:31:50,992 --> 01:31:55,492
"The End"
