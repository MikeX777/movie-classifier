1
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,140
Hey, where's Ryota?

2
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,560
Mr Suzuki wanted to see him.

3
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,690
Is he getting detention again?

4
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,020
Again?

5
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,770
- You're late!
- You're late!

6
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,940
Sorry, sorry!

7
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,570
All right.

8
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,450
What shall we start with?

9
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,660
What else?

10
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,030
Yeah.

11
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,950
Obviously.

12
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,830
You're right!

13
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,170
Here we go!

14
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,960
<i>Don't worry! Be happy!</i>

15
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,670
<i>It's my life!</i>

16
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,800
<i>Little Love Song</i>

17
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,230
<i>Another beautiful Sunday morning</i>

18
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,020
<i>Start of a day both short and long</i>

19
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,650
<i>I've got nothing on my schedule</i>

20
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,780
<i>Think I'll take a walk about town</i>

21
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,820
<i>Keep the door closed when playing.</i>

22
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,780
<i>Keep the volume down.</i>

23
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,420
- Is that them?
- I think so!

24
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,220
<i>You and me, just the two of us</i>

25
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,140
<i>Until a starry sky rises overhead</i>

26
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,480
<i>Until a starry sky rises overhead</i>

27
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:06,650
<i>Happiness is spending time</i>

28
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,070
<i>With you</i>

29
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,450
<i>Don't worry</i>

30
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,160
<i>Be happy</i>

31
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,120
<i>Happy Sunday</i>

32
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,870
<i>It's my life</i>

33
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,460
<i>Don't worry</i>

34
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,380
<i>Be happy</i>

35
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,000
<i>Happy Sunday</i>

36
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,670
<i>It's my life</i>

37
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,440
<i>What's the matter?</i>

38
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,150
<i>Why are you looking so blue?</i>

39
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,820
<i>There's nothing to worry about</i>

40
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,910
<i>Let's go!</i>

41
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:15,550
<i>Because tomorrow...</i>

42
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,890
<i>is Sunday!</i>

43
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,390
<i>Don't worry</i>

44
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,980
<i>Be happy</i>

45
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,980
<i>Happy Sunday</i>

46
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,650
<i>It's my life</i>

47
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,320
<i>Don't worry</i>

48
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,940
<i>Be happy</i>

49
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,990
<i>Happy Sunday</i>

50
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,620
<i>It's my life</i>

51
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,870
One more time!

52
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,620
<i>Don't worry</i>

53
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,170
You there! Stop that!

54
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,420
<i>Happy Sunday</i>

55
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,960
<i>It's my life</i>

56
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,970
<i>Don't worry</i>

57
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,680
<i>Be happy</i>

58
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,430
<i>Happy Sunday</i>

59
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,310
<i>It's my life</i>

60
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,780
Thank you!

61
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,110
You rock!

62
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,660
How many times is this now?

63
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,790
Well, Ms Moromiri?

64
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,840
I am so sorry!

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,050
You, too.

66
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,300
We're sorry.

67
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,470
Enough is enough.

68
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,350
Ikehara, Maeshiro, Shinzato!

69
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,350
Fukumura!

70
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,980
You disappoint me.

71
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,060
Keep this up and you'll be banned

72
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,860
from the school festival.

73
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,820
Not just your band.
All the other bands too.

74
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,820
We're sorry.

75
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,030
You need to shape up

76
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,450
and keep your friends in line!

77
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,290
What a prig.

78
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,710
- Shush.
- What did you say?

79
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,960
What's his problem? Everybody liked it.

80
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,470
We can't get banned from the festival.

81
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,970
Shinzato! That was so cool!

82
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,930
- Really? Thanks.
- You see?

83
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,390
Wait...

84
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,680
- Give me her number.
- No way.

85
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,520
Oh... Shinji's sister.

86
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,110
Mai.

87
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,780
Don't tell Dad.

88
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,780
Are you stupid?

89
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,950
Be proud of what we did!

90
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Everyone had a good time!

91
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,910
- Idiot.
- Dummy.

92
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,290
Let's continue jamming!

93
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,300
You're banned from using the club room.

94
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,300
Move, Kotaro!

95
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,260
Yes, I win!

96
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,850
All right.

97
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,140
Mr Nema!

98
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,400
- Hey, Mr Nema!
- Mr Nema!

99
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,480
- Mr Nema!
- You there, Mr Nema?

100
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,570
- Let us use the studio!
- Guys! Quiet!

101
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,530
He's here.

102
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,700
I told you about him.

103
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,120
The guy from a Tokyo record label

104
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,620
who's interested in your band.

105
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,660
Wait... wait!

106
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,580
Sorry, sir.

107
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,920
These are the boys I told you about.

108
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,050
Shibuya?

109
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,720
Have you ever been to Shibuya?

110
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,300
So, I'd like to ask you boys

111
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,600
if you're interested
in going professional.

112
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,070
Going professional?

113
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,080
Wait up!

114
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,670
Hey! Which way is Tokyo?

115
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,210
Let me see...

116
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,720
- That way!
- That way?

117
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,550
Are we really going to Tokyo?

118
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,350
After we graduate.

119
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,390
We can make it!

120
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,930
Our music rocks!

121
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,350
We can do it!

122
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,310
But Tokyo is where
all the best bands are.

123
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,270
Bring them on!

124
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,610
Hey, Tokyo! We're going to kick butt!

125
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,070
Just you wait!

126
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,240
We did it, Tokyo!

127
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,780
We're coming!

128
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,120
Tokyo! T-Tokyo Tower.

129
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,000
You're an idiot.

130
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,670
Come on! Do it with me!

131
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,460
Tokyo Tower!

132
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,760
- Tokyo Tower!
- You, too! Tokyo Tower!

133
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,960
Tokyo Tower.

134
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,970
Tokyo, why do we have to go to you?

135
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,640
You come to us!

136
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,390
Come to Okinawa!

137
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,480
Nishi-Nippori, right? Gotanda, right?

138
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,980
- Where's that?
- Or Otsuka!

139
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,230
- You're such a hick.
- See you!

140
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,110
Let's get sushi at Ginza!

141
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,570
- Whatever!
- In your dreams!

142
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,660
Tokyo, huh?

143
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,910
This is serious stuff.

144
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,290
Are you going to tell

145
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,000
your American girlfriend, Lisa?

146
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,920
- About Tokyo.
- What?

147
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,170
It's a good chance to ask her out.

148
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,510
"I want you."

149
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,090
Cut it out, idiot.

150
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,640
No, I'm serious.

151
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,220
Well...

152
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,640
I'll ask her out when we take Tokyo.

153
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,230
Wow, I didn't expect that from you.

154
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,900
You surprised me.

155
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,280
You've got to start with a kiss, right?

156
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,530
Right in her face.

157
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,860
Oh, shut up.

158
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,450
And she'll whimper, "Oh, Shinji..."

159
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,040
Somebody call an ambulance!

160
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,160
Hurry!

161
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,760
Daiki!

162
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,090
Daiki!

163
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,850
Daiki!

164
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,360
Are you Mrs Maeshiro?

165
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,110
- Yes.
- This way.

166
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,680
Ryota.

167
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,060
Ryota! You're OK!

168
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,900
Thank goodness.

169
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,520
I'm so relieved.

170
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,190
Who are you?

171
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,490
Who the hell are you?

172
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,420
What are you talking about?

173
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,250
It's me, Shinji.

174
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,420
Amnesia?

175
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,220
Yes. The trauma of the incident

176
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,890
has caused some impairment to his memory.

177
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,190
I don't know you.

178
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,070
Get your hands off me!

179
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,070
Where are you taking me?

180
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,200
Hey...

181
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,870
You're just pulling my leg, right?

182
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,250
You are, aren't you?

183
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,040
Huh? What are you babbling about?

184
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,540
What's with you?

185
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,420
You really don't remember?

186
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,630
Me?

187
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,420
Our band?

188
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,890
Our band?

189
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,470
Get in here.

190
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,330
Do you remember?

191
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,000
Remember what?

192
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,340
You don't recognise this place?

193
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,920
Should I?

194
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,590
What is this about?

195
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,520
Look.

196
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,610
Here!

197
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,240
- Yo.
- Yo.

198
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,360
Hey.

199
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,660
- Later.
- Bye.

200
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,160
- Later.
- See you.

201
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,990
You're early.

202
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,660
- Ryota came up with the lyrics.
- Lyrics?

203
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,000
For the song I wrote yesterday.

204
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,170
Shinji, let's change the chorus.

205
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,550
To "I'd die to see you."

206
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,590
- "I'd die to see you?"
- Yeah.

207
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,010
Try it.

208
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:54,770
<i>I'd die to see you</i>

209
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,400
<i>Die to see you</i>

210
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,160
Better?

211
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,030
- I like it.
- Let's do it.

212
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,410
Yeah.

213
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,770
I don't believe you.

214
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,200
OK. Look over there.

215
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,790
Do you see it?

216
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,710
See what?

217
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,710
Our view from the stage.

218
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,310
Let's rock this place.

219
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,690
<i>Ura High Courtyard Live</i>

220
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,690
Oh yeah, we changed that part.

221
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,610
You're nervous.

222
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,860
- Hey, Ryota.
- Hey.

223
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,030
- What are you playing?
- An original.

224
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,280
Seriously? An original?

225
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,370
It'll blow you away. Just wait and see.

226
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,000
- Good luck!
- You'd better get pumped!

227
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,120
- Good luck!
- Yeah, man!

228
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,500
Ryota.

229
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,720
One, two, three!

230
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,850
Come on...

231
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,040
<i>When you were so kind to me</i>

232
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,420
<i>I learnt how small I really am</i>

233
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:26,800
<i>Ashamed for ever doubting you</i>

234
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:32,390
<i>You've made a believer out of me</i>

235
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:37,560
<i>The days flow by so quickly</i>

236
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,940
<i>I drift in an ever-changing world</i>

237
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,200
<i>But one thing that won't budge</i>

238
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:53,700
<i>Is my love for you</i>

239
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,870
<i>So don't you cry, my dearest</i>

240
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,510
<i>There's joy in the anguish of love</i>

241
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,800
<i>Before you know it, you will see</i>

242
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:15,060
<i>Just how much you mean to me</i>

243
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,350
<i>More today than yesterday we'll be</i>

244
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:27,320
<i>Before you know it, in my arms</i>

245
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:36,750
<i>I'd die to see you</i>

246
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,170
<i>Die to see you</i>

247
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:47,590
<i>I'd die to see you</i>

248
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,640
<i>Die to see you</i>

249
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:58,270
<i>I'd die to see you</i>

250
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,940
<i>Die to see you</i>

251
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,110
We won everyone's hearts
with that first gig.

252
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,410
I knew from that one show

253
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,200
that we found our place.

254
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,410
How could you possibly forget

255
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,620
something so important?

256
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,650
Yeah! That's awesome!

257
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,650
You guys rock. You really do.

258
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,910
And I don't say that to just anyone.

259
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,450
Ever!

260
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,580
Mr Nema said that

261
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,170
and introduced us
to a Tokyo record label.

262
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,880
You say that, but I don't remember...

263
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,750
Come on!

264
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,380
You can't possibly have
forgotten it all!

265
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,890
All the time we spent making it happen.

266
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,650
Fine.

267
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,330
So I guess we're friends, then?

268
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,670
- Sorry, I forgot.
- Not just friends!

269
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,590
You and I aren't just friends!

270
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,880
We're a band.

271
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,230
Hi.

272
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,690
You're Shinji's sister, right?

273
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,700
And Shinji?

274
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,990
What's he doing now?

275
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,120
Wait a second.

276
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,040
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

277
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,210
- On the rocks?
- That's fine.

278
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,630
OK. Enjoy.

279
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,170
Is Ryota in?

280
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,300
Ryota! Shinji's here!

281
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,140
Sorry. No response.

282
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,640
- That's Okay.
- Oh, sorry!

283
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,310
Ryota.

284
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,020
Ryota.

285
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,230
- Let's go.
- Where to?

286
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,860
- You'll see.
- What?

287
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:21,320
I thought we were going to your place.

288
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,010
Lisa.

289
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,640
Hi, Ryota.

290
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,100
I ran into her on the way over.

291
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,520
We meet here a lot.

292
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,400
At this fence?

293
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,570
She hasn't been on
this side of the fence.

294
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,740
What do you do here?

295
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,910
What?

296
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,820
What did he say?

297
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,290
What do you do here?

298
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,250
Us?

299
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,580
Yes.

300
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:19,590
Shinji lets me listen to his songs.

301
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,880
Songs?

302
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,420
Yeah, like this.

303
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,810
Through the ear buds.

304
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,100
Across international borders!

305
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,900
- What?
- I mean...

306
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,020
This is Okinawa

307
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,520
that's an American military base.

308
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,110
You're crossing national lines!

309
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,860
Not physically.

310
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,030
I know, but...

311
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,740
You make an interesting couple.

312
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,910
Shinji.

313
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,170
This song... did you write this too?

314
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,880
Yes.

315
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,510
I think you should
tell Lisa you like her.

316
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,130
Say "I want you!"

317
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,050
I know.

318
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,760
Invite her to our next gig.

319
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,850
The school festival!

320
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,770
That would be the perfect chance, right?

321
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,240
Hey...

322
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,740
What do you say?

323
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,780
Listen.

324
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,050
It's not funny.

325
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,420
You idiot.

326
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,550
I'm sorry.

327
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,560
Why have you forgotten?

328
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,810
I said, I'm sorry.

329
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,520
Hell.

330
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,280
I wish you'd remember.

331
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,530
I really wish you'd remember.

332
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,450
My bad.

333
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,930
My god.

334
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,400
What's up? What's wrong?

335
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,790
Shinji...

336
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,080
I'm glad.

337
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,880
I'm really glad.

338
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,520
Call an ambulance! Hurry!

339
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,500
Shinji...

340
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,590
Shinji...

341
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,670
Shinji!

342
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,510
Hey... come on, Shinji!

343
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,090
Are you OK?

344
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:12,050
In highly stressful situations

345
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:16,220
the mind can suppress certain memories

346
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,220
as a form of self-defence.

347
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,560
To prevent further trauma

348
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,140
from recalling the stressful event.

349
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,100
It can't be.

350
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,310
I'm glad.

351
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,650
I'm so glad you're safe.

352
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,200
Don't say that, Shinji.

353
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,660
You can't forget us, OK?

354
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,130
You made our band complete.

355
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,050
You put lyrics

356
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,300
to my songs and gave them life.

357
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,850
You can't forget any of that.

358
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,390
Hold on a second.

359
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,810
Tell me this isn't happening.

360
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,860
You know what, Ryota?

361
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,360
Being in a band with you

362
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,820
was the best thing in my life.

363
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,190
Stop it!

364
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,700
I'll never forgive you if you do this!

365
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,280
I'm so glad.

366
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,210
I'm glad you finally remember.

367
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:13,420
Shinji, stop saying that! Don't go!

368
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,920
- Wait!
- See you around, Ryota.

369
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,930
Shinji, no!

370
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,050
Shinji!

371
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,300
Shinji!

372
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,930
Shinji!

373
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,280
<i>Okinawa police are still
looking for clues</i>

374
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,530

US military base vehicle...</i>

378
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,880
<i>The central government
is investigating the case</i>

379
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,180
<i>through its foreign ministry.</i>

380
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,100
<i>The perpetrator has still
not been found.</i>

381
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,100
<i>Meanwhile, citizen groups have begun</i>

382
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,270
<i>protests around the military base...</i>

383
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:33,680
Ryota suffered only minor injuries.

384
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,440
I think he has been discharged.

385
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,610
I see.

386
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,700
I still can't believe it.

387
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:55,620
Daiki has joined another band

388
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,870
so he can play in the school festival.

389
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,380
Bassists are in great demand.

390
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,350
And you?

391
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,470
What will you do?

392
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,850
I was in the band...

393
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,860
because I love those guys.

394
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,600
Ryota!

395
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,600
Ryota!

396
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,850
Ryota!

397
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,980
Ryota!

398
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,610
Ryota!

399
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,410
Answer me when I call you.

400
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,870
Are your ears stuffed with wax?

401
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,620
It's Kotaro again.

402
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,500
He has been calling all morning.

403
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,420
Oh, he hung up.

404
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,400
Here.

405
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,380
Have you picked up your soul?

406
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,000
Your grandma thinks it got left

407
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:11,130
at the scene of the incident.

408
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,130
You need to go retrieve it.

409
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,310
This is important!

410
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,730
Yeah, all right.

411
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,580
Your soul, huh...

412
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,680
<i>Stop kowtowing to the US military!</i>

413
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,220
<i>Shinji will not rest in peace!</i>

414
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,690
Ryota!

415
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,610
How about this?

416
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,490
Maybe she came to do the same thing.

417
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,370
Retrieve Shinji's soul.

418
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,150
I'm home.

419
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,660
You're back.

420
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:47,120
Any word from the police?

421
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,790
They're dithering.

422
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,260
How hard can it be to
track down the driver?

423
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,890
They're dragging their heels.

424
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,640
The driver must be
someone from the base.

425
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,140
You don't know that!

426
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,350
But if it's true, what will you do?

427
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,770
Can you continue working there?

428
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,610
We'll cross that bridge
when we get there.

429
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,110
You need to prepare yourself.

430
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,240
I mean, if it's true

431
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,950
you can't return to the base, can you?

432
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:29,040
Can you change jobs so
you don't have to go?

433
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,580
I said...

434
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,840
we don't know anything yet.

435
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,460
There's no point thinking about it.

436
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,940
According to eyewitness testimony

437
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,570
the getaway vehicle had a Y number plate

438
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,480
of a vehicle from the US military base.

439
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,740
In response,
local residents have gathered

440
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,450
in protest outside the Kerana Air Base

441
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,280
near the site of the accident.

442
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,160
The fugitive remains at large

443
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,540
but as a
military connection is suspected

444
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,870
we urge all military personnel to...

445
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,540
I hope it wasn't one of us.

446
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,380
This hit-and-run case.

447
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,670
If this were really true

448
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,880
we'd all leave them a bad impression.

449
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,720
Just because of one rotten apple.

450
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,550
We could even be restricted to the base.

451
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,720
Right?

452
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,270
The MPs are investigating.

453
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,640
- Right?
- Yeah.

454
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,440
Well, I guess it's not as easy

455
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,070
as it could be back home.

456
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,950
Hope we can go back soon...

457
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,700
Lisa, dinner's ready!

458
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,490
<i>Untitled</i>

459
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,200
Hey.

460
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,580
Do you have a minute?

461
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,720
What is this about?

462
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,470
I found this song
on my brother's laptop.

463
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,030
What is this?

464
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:37,450
I think it was his new song.

465
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,040
I've never heard it before.

466
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,880
You know all of your brother's songs?

467
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,770
So... what about it?

468
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:10,900
I want you to play this song.

469
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,370
Play it? Why?

470
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:18,580
It'd be a shame if this song
goes unheard.

471
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,080
Who's going to play it?

472
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,880
Let's do it, Ryota.

473
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,920
We'll play it.

474
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,180
We? What are you talking about?

475
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,140
We don't have a guitarist or a bassist.

476
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,300
We'll find a guitarist.

477
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,060
Like who?

478
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,390
Everyone's busy with the festival.

479
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,770
There's no one left.

480
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,710
You play the guitar?

481
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,360
Daiki!

482
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,690
Daiki.

483
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,690
Shinji...

484
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:35,280
Shinji had written a new song.

485
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:38,740
Let's do it together. One more time.

486
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,790
- What do you mean?
- Never mind. Just come!

487
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:42,910
Wait! I can't!

488
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:46,580
What are you saying?

489
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,630
I've already joined Kengo's band.

490
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,260
Sorry, but still...

491
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:00,930
No buts.

492
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:05,480
The festival is coming up soon.

493
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:08,190
I joined late...

494
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,520
so I have to rehearse
like crazy to catch up.

495
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:20,740
I can't join you.

496
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:41,350
Oh, where did Ryota go?

497
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,070
Ryota... Ryota!

498
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:00,280
Sing! I want you to sing!

499
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,330
Ryota!

500
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,670
- Ryota...
- I can't!

501
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:19,220
I sing with my heart.

502
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,300
I sang <i>Don't Worry, Be Happy</i>

503
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,720
to cheer everyone up.

504
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,640
I can't sing it if I don't feel it!

505
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,270
I bare my soul when I sing.

506
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,780
Everyone will know if I fake it!

507
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,240
I can't...

508
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,450
I can't even imagine singing right now!

509
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,540
I envy you.

510
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,090
You just have to wave
your drumsticks around.

511
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,800
How dare you!

512
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:07,770
You!

513
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:12,980
Idiot!

514
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:17,730
You have no idea

515
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,740
what I'm going through!

516
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,490
Right back at you!

517
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,870
We have to do this!

518
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,490
Who else will, if not us?

519
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,370
How can you act like
everything's normal?

520
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,120
I do it for Shinji!

521
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,580
Shinji's dead!

522
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:37,090
If you don't sing for him, nobody will!

523
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,510
Ouch.

524
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,270
What are you looking at?

525
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:43,650
I was thinking, all it takes is a swing.

526
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,610
An awesome thing it is, that swing.

527
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,910
Shinji.

528
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:53,790
I heard your song.

529
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:55,960
What do you think?

530
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:57,670
You're awesome too.

531
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,290
It's a really good tune.

532
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,380
Yeah?

533
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,760
Did you play it for her?

534
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,300
For who?

535
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,840
- Lisa.
- Of course not.

536
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:10,260
Not before you've put lyrics to it.

537
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,690
In that case...

538
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,190
I'll make it a love song.

539
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:26,110
A love song?

540
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:28,530
Why not?

541
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:30,410
You?

542
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,790
Shut up.

543
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,210
I'll write a killer love song.

544
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,000
Just you wait.

545
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,540
A love song so good

546
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:43,130
you can use it to ask Lisa out

547
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,420
and get a kiss from her.

548
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,970
Stop it.

549
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,620
- Nice.
- Great, huh?

550
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,950
Yeah.

551
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:32,220
<i>Here, I'm right beside you</i>

552
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:41,230
<i>Like a loved one ought to be</i>

553
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:47,740
<i>With a little love song</i>

554
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:57,120
<i>Delivered to your ears only</i>

555
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,100
Ryota?

556
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,680
Ryota.

557
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:19,770
Ryota, is that you?

558
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,440
Oh, I didn't expect to see you here.

559
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:25,020
Hi.

560
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,070
How are you?

561
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:32,490
Good.

562
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:34,740
How are you?

563
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,530
Well...

564
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:45,920
Actually, I was hoping
to tell you something.

565
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,000
Tell me.

566
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:54,590
I'm leaving Okinawa.

567
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:56,970
Soon.

568
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:00,310
Leaving?

569
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,810
Yeah.

570
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,520
In...

571
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:06,480
one month, I think?

572
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:10,980
My father is transferring.

573
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,280
Transfer?

574
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,030
Transferring.

575
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,790
We're going back to the States.

576
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:28,130
Back to America.

577
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:30,670
I see.

578
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:41,970
Shinji had asked me

579
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:45,980
to come see your band play.

580
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:47,900
Shinji did?

581
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:53,280
I'd have been able to see you sing too

582
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,950
if I had gone.

583
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:59,370
It's too bad.

584
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:15,300
OK then.

585
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:16,510
Come!

586
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:19,390
Come to <i>gakusai!</i>

587
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,810
The school festival.

588
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,600
What?

589
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:25,850
I'm singing.

590
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:29,310
I'm singing Shinji's song.

591
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,440
His song's great.

592
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:36,650
So, I'm singing.

593
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:41,620
You're sure it's one month, right?

594
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:44,120
- Yeah.
- Please come!

595
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,540
Really?

596
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:49,420
OK... I'll be there!

597
00:54:58,050 --> 00:54:59,550
I'm sorry.

598
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,970
Please be our guitarist.

599
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,640
I'll have to play bass.

600
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:08,850
I'm 17.

601
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,100
Really?

602
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:11,440
Mum.

603
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:13,730
Let me borrow this.

604
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,360
Hey, wait.

605
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,490
I think she's adorable.

606
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:20,660
I approve.

607
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,990
What? She's Shinji's sister.

608
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,160
- I'm taking this.
- Oh, sure.

609
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:36,300
Kotaro.

610
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,660
Let's go.

611
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,380
Ouch.

612
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:23,930
Hey!

613
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,810
<i>Hit-and-Run Investigation Hits A Snag</i>

614
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:35,770
<i>Citizens Protest at US Base</i>

615
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,190
Mr Nema!

616
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,530
Hey.

617
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:56,080
A girl?

618
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,680
Then do this...

619
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:08,060
Thank you.

620
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:14,140
A three-piece band, huh? Cool.

621
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,400
- Really?
- Really.

622
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:21,070
I didn't know his little sister plays.

623
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:46,840
Mai, hit the pedal.

624
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:50,100
Too loud.

625
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:52,100
First time on an amplifier?

626
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:54,350
You can strum now.

627
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,400
That should work.

628
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:21,880
Hold on.

629
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:24,840
You know all of Shinji's songs?

630
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:28,220
Show us.

631
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,550
Good... good!

632
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:09,970
Real good.

633
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:13,510
I need to buck up.

634
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,560
Tell me, Ryota.

635
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:20,400
How did the three of you get together?

636
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:22,400
My brother's song...

637
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,150
For the school festival.

638
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,400
Yeah, we're performing. The three of us.

639
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:32,280
- No way!
- Does the teacher know?

640
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:39,460
You're telling me this now?

641
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:43,090
Listen. We've already drafted the setlist.

642
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:45,420
Every band has been assigned a slot

643
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,260
and are rehearsing their songs.

644
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,180
Isn't that right, Ms Moromiri?

645
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,930
Well, yes, but...

646
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:56,560
So...

647
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,690
we can play if the
other bands are okay with it?

648
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,560
Is that what you're saying?

649
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:09,400
Please! Just this once!

650
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:18,870
I guess it's OK.

651
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,040
Really?

652
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,500
Hey, are you guys going to do

653
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:24,000
something crazy again?

654
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,710
We won't. I promise!

655
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:28,000
Do you mean it?

656
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:30,630
- Yeah...
- Thank you!

657
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,180
- Thank you!
- Okay..

658
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:36,890
OK, guys. Let's shorten our set

659
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,810
so they can perform.

660
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:41,020
Thanks, guys!

661
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,690
Thank you all.

662
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

663
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,390
You know...

664
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,720
I thought you were Shinji.

665
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:23,480
There's a guitar on your back.

666
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:30,360
I started playing the guitar

667
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:33,900
and I joined a band.

668
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,320
A band?

669
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:38,280
Ryota's band?

670
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,660
Really?

671
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,160
Great! That's... awesome!

672
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,210
So, it's you!

673
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:48,210
You're playing with Ryota

674
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:49,500
at the school festival.

675
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:51,500
Yeah, the school festival.

676
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:55,380
School festival... it will be

677
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:56,590
great!

678
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,350
So, please come.

679
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:02,270
OK!

680
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:18,200
Hey, Mai.

681
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:22,120
This song? Ryota said that

682
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,700
you guys will be playing this song.

683
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:27,540
- Yeah.
- You're playing this song, right?

684
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:31,500
This song is my favourite...

685
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,710
of Shinji's songs.

686
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,880
It's my favourite.

687
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,970
Maybe Ryota knew.

688
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,810
By the way, what's the song about?

689
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:46,810
About?

690
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:49,150
About...

691
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:54,030
- Love?
- Love?

692
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,240
Like?

693
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:58,700
What's <i>koi </i>in English?

694
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:03,740
- Small love.
- Small love?

695
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:06,330
Small, small love.

696
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,290
Lisa!

697
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,550
Oh, I have to go.

698
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:17,970
- I should...
- Okay..

699
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:19,720
- See you!
- See you.

700
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:25,060
- Who is that?
- Nothing.

701
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,430
What were you talking about?

702
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,350
- Nothing!
- Lisa, wait!

703
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,400
You're aware we've
been restricted to the base.

704
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,810
The protests at the gate... it's serious.

705
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:35,230
Listen! There are people out there

706
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,030
that don't think well of us.

707
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:38,860
You need to be careful!

708
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,450
Lisa!

709
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:52,330
Go back! No base!

710
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,960
<i>No Osprey! Protect our children!</i>

711
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,380
<i>Protect our future!</i>

712
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:03,300
<i>An angry crowd has gathered</i>

713
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:05,640
<i>protesting loudly in front of the police</i>

714
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,390
<i>guarding the base.</i>

715
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:10,560
<i>The incident occurred</i>

716
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,150
<i>near the Kerana Base on the 14th.</i>

717
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:16,900
<i>Protesters clashed with the police</i>

718
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:20,070
<i>who were there to disperse them.</i>

719
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:22,740
<i>A protestor was knocked down...</i>

720
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:24,570
Oh, you're home.

721
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,200
What's going on?

722
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:29,830
<i>The Okinawa Defence Bureau</i>

723
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:31,460
<i>held a press conference.</i>

724
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:33,460
What's with all the protests?

725
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:37,880
Wait, was the hit-and-run driver

726
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,710
someone from the military base?

727
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:42,970
We don't know yet.

728
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:46,970
What will they gain

729
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:50,520
by turning their anger at the base?

730
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,650
Their anger is misdirected.

731
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:00,030
What should they do then?

732
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:08,620
Mai.

733
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:11,580
Are you studying hard?

734
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:16,040
Keep your grades up

735
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,840
and get into a good university

736
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,710
on the mainland.

737
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:25,010
When you've experienced life outside

738
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,930
you'll understand the issues

739
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:31,470
that plague this tiny island.

740
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:36,770
You'll see that nothing has changed.

741
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:49,780
That's why you've got to study hard.

742
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,720
<i>Another beautiful Sunday morning</i>

743
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:14,520
<i>Start of a day both short and long</i>

744
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,270
<i>I've got nothing on my schedule</i>

745
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:20,230
<i>Think I'll take a walk about town</i>

746
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:28,450
OK, stop!

747
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,240
Mai, your playing sounds listless.

748
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:33,160
Is something wrong?

749
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,250
I can hear it in your music.

750
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:39,000
You can tell us if
anything's bothering you.

751
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:44,460
Yeah, that's what we are here for.

752
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,510
You're talking sense for once, Ryota.

753
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:48,760
Right?

754
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:51,220
Don't get carried away.

755
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:58,940
- Again!
- All right!

756
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:02,360
One, two, three, four!

757
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:04,900
Yeah.

758
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,280
I'm so excited.

759
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,990
You have it good.

760
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:14,830
Stop... stop!

761
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:16,700
Bass is going too fast, Ryota.

762
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:18,460
I'm moving the song along.

763
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,250
No, follow my drums.

764
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:22,130
But you have no sense of rhythm.

765
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:00,220
How's practice?

766
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:01,980
So hard!

767
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,270
And we need lyrics.

768
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,560
What?

769
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,030
Mai.

770
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,870
I think I know why Roosevelt

771
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:21,080
chose this island.

772
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,500
I bet everybody here

773
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:27,380
used to all be really nice.

774
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:32,670
Have you been to other base

775
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,800
in another country?

776
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:35,430
Yeah.

777
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:39,890
Because we usually move
like every two years.

778
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,640
But we already bought
a house in Florida.

779
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:44,850
Florida?

780
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:48,730
Yeah. We're going to live there

781
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:51,110
once my father retires.

782
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:53,740
Many families buy a house

783
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:57,030
a place they like
while they move around.

784
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:00,490
I should go.

785
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:02,080
My parents will be home soon.

786
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,540
OK.

787
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:14,470
Mai...

788
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:21,850
My father works on Ospreys.

789
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:27,350
Are you against Ospreys?

790
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,900
I don't know.

791
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,530
Sorry...

792
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,410
No. Don't worry.

793
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:48,960
Can you really come?

794
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:50,460
To the school festival.

795
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:53,760
Yes. I'm coming.

796
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:56,970
- See you there.
- See you.

797
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:19,990
So, did you hear about the rumours?

798
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:21,120
The one about the Y-plate

799
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,120
running over the Japanese kid?

800
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,410
What the hell is the
Japanese police doing?

801
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,750
I don't know, man, but they need to

802
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:27,870
get the restrictions lifted

803
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,420
because I can't stand it.

804
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,380
Yeah, I wanna go surfing, man.

805
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,460
Tell me about it. I can't stand it.

806
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:35,420
Sweet little thing.

807
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:38,050
What are you doing over here?

808
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,510
Hey, kid.

809
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,560
You all right?

810
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:50,560
Looking for someone?

811
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:57,240
One, two...

812
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,820
Hey, one, two.

813
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:00,530
Mr Nema, turn it up a little more, please.

814
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:01,780
OK.

815
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,160
Hey, one, two...

816
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,580
Hey, one, two...

817
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,250
Hey, check, one, two.

818
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:10,710
Hey... one, two.

819
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:12,120
Check, one, two.

820
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:13,420
All right, good to go.

821
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,290
OK. Thank you.

822
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:20,470
Mr Nema.

823
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:22,090
- A live gig tonight?
- Yeah.

824
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:28,060
The band members are
outside taking a break.

825
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:31,520
You guys can take the stage.

826
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:33,270
Really?

827
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,690
Let's go.

828
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:53,580
OK, guys.

829
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:55,790
Let's see how you sound.

830
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:57,500
May we?

831
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,550
- Let's play.
- Yeah.

832
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,180
Hey, welcome back.

833
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:08,930
- Thanks.
- We're back.

834
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:10,350
Sorry, give them five.

835
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:21,030
What?

836
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:24,660
You like being on stage, don't you?

837
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:38,540
<i>I'd die to see you</i>

838
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:41,460
<i>Die to see you</i>

839
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:55,350
Play a song.

840
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,770
I'll record it for you.

841
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,360
Which song?

842
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,360
- That one?
- That one?

843
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,820
What's "that one"?

844
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,660
<i>Don't Worry,</i> of course.

845
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:07,320
OK.

846
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:11,120
One, two, three, four!

847
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:12,620
<i>Don't worry</i>

848
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,120
<i>Be happy</i>

849
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:18,130
<i>It's my life</i>

850
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,510
They're good.

851
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:30,010
<i>Another beautiful Sunday morning</i>

852
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:32,850
<i>Start of a day both short and long</i>

853
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:35,480
<i>I've got nothing on my schedule</i>

854
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:38,310
<i>Think I'll take a walk about town</i>

855
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:46,490
<i>Under a crystal clear blue sky</i>

856
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:49,450
<i>Even the sun seems in the way</i>

857
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:52,120
<i>The two of us, a happy lunch time</i>

858
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,870
<i>Love and stomachs set to full</i>

859
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:00,790
Well? What do you think?

860
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,460
They're really good.

861
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:04,170
- Yeah?
- Awesome.

862
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:05,970
That makes me happy.

863
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:07,630
I like these kids.

864
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:10,340
- Hey...
- Welcome back.

865
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:11,850
- Listen to this.
- What is it?

866
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:13,100
These kids rock.

867
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,640
Let me see.

868
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,140
They're playing at a school festival.

869
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:18,810
Come see them.

870
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:20,980
- Give me one.
- Of course.

871
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:22,360
Oh, Mr Nema.

872
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,480
I went to this high school.

873
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:24,610
- You're alumni?
- Yeah.

874
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:26,070
Go support them.

875
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:28,780
I'll put this up at my store.

876
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:31,410
- Really? Hold on.
- Give me some.

877
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:34,240
I was hoping you'd say that. Thanks.

878
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:35,370
I'll pass them out too.

879
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:37,250
Support your juniors.

880
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:10,070
Mum?

881
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,320
You're not coming to
the school festival, right?

882
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:16,410
Why? Why are you asking?

883
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:19,250
No reason. It'll be boring.

884
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,880
We don't want to show up

885
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,960
and cast a gloom over the event.

886
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,810
OK. See you later.

887
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:38,640
Have a good day in school.

888
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,980
Oh, Mai?

889
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:45,650
Your father...

890
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,990
will probably quit his job at the base.

891
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:56,990
We don't know if the driver is American

892
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:01,000
but your dad can't
take off work anymore.

893
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,790
But don't worry.

894
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,130
He has the qualifications.

895
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:12,260
I'm sure he'll find work quickly.

896
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:20,560
OK.

897
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,810
- Got to go.
- See you.

898
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:33,650
<i>18th Ura High School Festival</i>

899
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:35,110
Welcome!

900
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,540
Shaved ice, please!

901
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:43,870
That was fun!

902
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,460
We're not done and don't hit me!

903
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:48,630
I thought we were.

904
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:51,170
Snap!

905
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,800
Enough with the selfies!

906
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,550
After riding the roller coaster...

907
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:25,250
Where are you going?

908
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:29,960
- The theme centre.
- Okay.

909
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:41,600
- Dad?
- Yeah?

910
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:47,850
Have you gone off the base recently?

911
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,650
Off base?

912
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:56,150
You do know we've been restricted

913
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,570
to the base, right?

914
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:00,280
Sure, but it's been lifted.

915
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:03,160
Well, I...

916
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:05,620
still don't think it's a
good idea just yet.

917
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:08,870
Sometimes, even a small incident

918
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,790
could lead to something much bigger.

919
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:18,880
- Dad...
- Yeah?

920
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:22,890
Do you think that it's better that we...

921
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,600
you know, try to get along

922
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:25,930
with the local people?

923
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,560
Honey, of course.

924
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,940
But in reality

925
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:36,360
some things aren't so simple.

926
01:19:39,490 --> 01:19:42,030
So, we just do

927
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,620
what we're assigned to do here.

928
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,090
I'll just...

929
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:04,350
Is it true we can't perform?

930
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:06,140
It's not fair.

931
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,100
Why can't we perform?

932
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:10,770
Look at this.

933
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:18,530
It's all over the Internet.

934
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:20,030
That's us.

935
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:23,530
The school got flooded with calls

936
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:26,120
from people asking if we're playing.

937
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,580
So the teachers got wind of it.

938
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:30,460
Explain yourselves!

939
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:32,830
Outside activities are forbidden!

940
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,460
- We were just...
- You're mistaken.

941
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:36,210
Mistaken?

942
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:38,050
How do you explain this then?

943
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,550
"Breaking band's debut concert"!

944
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,760
You're using the
school festival to debut?

945
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:47,640
What? Who made this?

946
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,480
I don't know.

947
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:52,100
But we've got nothing to do with this.

948
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:55,230
The teachers are
too mad to listen to us.

949
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:57,610
There you are, guys!

950
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,690
This is going to be your big break.

951
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:03,360
The band you met at
the studio the other day

952
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:05,740
posted a clip of you jamming online

953
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:08,040
and now it has gone viral.

954
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:11,080
The people I've shown it to

955
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,210
are all blown away by you guys.

956
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:15,250
So I told them about your festival gig

957
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:17,250
and word got around.

958
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,380
Today's going to be a big day for you.

959
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,340
Huge!

960
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:25,550
I kept running out of leaflets...

961
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:26,850
Yeah, that's the one.

962
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:31,350
I'm the one who made this leaflet.

963
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,270
What's wrong?

964
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:45,410
So, you just need a ride, right?

965
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:47,200
- Yeah.
- Okay.

966
01:22:18,650 --> 01:22:20,770
Power's on, Shinzato!

967
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:23,280
OK, plug in this cord.

968
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,650
OK!

969
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:27,070
- I'm counting on you.
- Okay!

970
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:40,790
Is this OK for you?

971
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,420
Yeah. Thank you.

972
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,090
We're ready here.

973
01:22:44,170 --> 01:22:46,590
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

974
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:56,520
This is all I can do for you.

975
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,190
You're on your own now.

976
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:01,650
Are you sure about this?

977
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:05,570
Of course!

978
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:11,490
I saw the video.

979
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:16,040
To be honest...

980
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,880
it really made me regret leaving the band.

981
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:23,460
But...

982
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,630
the three of you make an awesome band!

983
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,100
Go kick some butt, yeah?

984
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:47,280
ID, please.

985
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:52,990
You see that?

986
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:58,040
I know it's pay day

987
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,830
just try not to have
too much fun out there.

988
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:02,040
I'm just a driver for my niece today.

989
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:04,550
Miss, ID?

990
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:22,770
Just don't drink, all right?

991
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:24,900
Half the guys in Camp Hansen

992
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:26,610
are in there for drinking.

993
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:28,110
I hear you. And the other half

994
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:30,570
is there for women, right?

995
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:31,700
All right.

996
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:47,460
Peace to Okinawa!

997
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:49,010
Go home!

998
01:24:51,510 --> 01:24:56,890
Go home... go home!

999
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:25,750
OK. You guys ready?

1000
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:31,010
I wonder if Lisa's here?

1001
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:33,180
I hope so!

1002
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:51,610
<i>Mic test, mic test.</i>

1003
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:00,740
<i>We have a song. Hope you like it.</i>

1004
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:08,130
<i>In a corner of vast space</i>

1005
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:13,340
<i>On a world resplendent blue</i>

1006
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:18,510
<i>Faint feelings of love</i>

1007
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,470
<i>Come delivered...</i>

1008
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,680
- Isn't that live?
- <i>To you</i>

1009
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:30,480
<i>Now that I have met you</i>

1010
01:26:30,570 --> 01:26:31,820
Has the concert started?

1011
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:35,400
<i>The time just rushes by</i>

1012
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:40,700
<i>The rhythm of two hearts</i>

1013
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:45,750
<i>Beating happy, beating sad</i>

1014
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,130
<i>Reverberating far as it can go</i>

1015
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:53,630
<i>A gentle song</i>

1016
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:59,850
<i>To change the world</i>

1017
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:04,470
<i>Here, I'm right beside you</i>

1018
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:10,560
<i>Like a loved one ought to be</i>

1019
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:17,610
<i>With just a little love song</i>

1020
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:21,280
<i>Delivered to your ears only</i>

1021
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:25,910
<i>Here</i>

1022
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:31,130
<i>Here</i>

1023
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:37,010
<i>Here</i>

1024
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:39,340
<i>Feel that, my little love song</i>

1025
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:41,970
<i>You came to realise</i>

1026
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:44,510
<i>I'm walking by your side</i>

1027
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,230
<i>On streets plunged into night</i>

1028
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:49,730
<i>We're lit by pure moonlight</i>

1029
01:27:49,810 --> 01:27:52,480
<i>Hand in hand, we depart</i>

1030
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,110
<i>We can't be pulled apart</i>

1031
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:57,690
<i>A love so strong</i>

1032
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:00,280
<i>It vows to last forever</i>

1033
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,870
<i>And if we reach the edge</i>

1034
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:05,450
<i>Of eternity we'll pledge</i>

1035
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:08,080
<i>The words of love</i>

1036
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:10,620
<i>That keep us tied together</i>

1037
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:15,800
<i>But if words are not enough</i>

1038
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:21,090
<i>Tears and joy will be the stuff</i>

1039
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:23,680
<i>And we'll just embrace each other</i>

1040
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:29,940
<i>We'll just embrace each other</i>

1041
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:34,560
<i>Here, I'm right beside you</i>

1042
01:28:34,650 --> 01:28:40,650
<i>Like a loved one ought to be</i>

1043
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:44,950
<i>With just a little love song</i>

1044
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:47,490
<i>Delivered to your ears only</i>

1045
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:51,080
<i>Feel that, my little love song</i>

1046
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:55,960
<i>Here</i>

1047
01:28:56,420 --> 01:29:01,170
<i>Here</i>

1048
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:07,140
<i>Here</i>

1049
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:10,680
<i>Feel that, my little love song</i>

1050
01:29:14,690 --> 01:29:18,360
<i>If it's all a dream, don't wake me</i>

1051
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:23,860
<i>If it's all a dream, don't wake me!</i>

1052
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,240
<i>Our time together will</i>

1053
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:35,460
<i>Become an shining star</i>

1054
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:39,710
<i>Here, I'm right beside you</i>

1055
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:45,930
<i>Like a loved one ought to be</i>

1056
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:50,140
<i>With just a little love song</i>

1057
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:52,640
<i>Delivered to your ears only</i>

1058
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:56,270
<i>Feel that, my little love song</i>

1059
01:29:56,350 --> 01:30:00,530
<i>Here, I'm right beside you</i>

1060
01:30:00,610 --> 01:30:06,740
<i>Like a loved one ought to be</i>

1061
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:10,700
<i>With just a little love song</i>

1062
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,620
<i>Delivered to your ears only</i>

1063
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:17,250
<i>Feel that, my little love song</i>

1064
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:21,960
<i>Here</i>

1065
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:27,180
<i>Here</i>

1066
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:33,270
<i>Here</i>

1067
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:37,230
<i>Feel that, my little love song</i>

1068
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:54,080
One more!

1069
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:57,080
One, two, three, four!

1070
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:58,540
<i>Don't worry</i>

1071
01:30:58,630 --> 01:31:00,290
<i>Be happy</i>

1072
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:04,260
<i>It's my life</i>

1073
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:16,310
<i>Another beautiful Sunday morning...</i>

1074
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,700
It got cut off. Why?

1075
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:31,950
Must be a malfunction.

1076
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,170
Where were you trying to go?

1077
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:43,250
I spoke with the sergeant too.

1078
01:31:44,590 --> 01:31:45,670
I could tell he was really

1079
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:46,970
just trying to help you out.

1080
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,800
Why did you want to go off the base?

1081
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:55,850
Is it something you
can't even share with us?

1082
01:31:55,930 --> 01:31:57,930
You know about the protest outside.

1083
01:31:58,270 --> 01:31:59,810
Did I tell you? The other day

1084
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:00,940
I caught her speaking with someone

1085
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:02,610
through the fence!

1086
01:32:08,150 --> 01:32:10,990
Your car, being surrounded

1087
01:32:11,070 --> 01:32:13,120
and blocked by protestors...

1088
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:18,080
You were about to be pulled into a mess!

1089
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:20,620
I am already!

1090
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:22,290
Lisa!

1091
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:25,210
You're suspended for two weeks.

1092
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:26,760
Suspended?

1093
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:30,430
I was hoping he'd at least

1094
01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:32,010
get through high school.

1095
01:32:32,090 --> 01:32:34,010
It's not expulsion, ma'am.

1096
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:36,890
It's just a suspension.

1097
01:32:38,350 --> 01:32:41,560
We tell our son to follow his heart

1098
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:44,360
so we don't mind, but...

1099
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,980
Stand up.

1100
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:51,570
We apologise for his
influence on your child.

1101
01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:53,200
Come on!

1102
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:55,410
Apologise.

1103
01:32:55,490 --> 01:32:56,700
It's all right.

1104
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:59,540
My son probably put them up to it.

1105
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:01,000
We're sorry.

1106
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:02,460
Our apologies.

1107
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:04,000
I'm sorry.

1108
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,920
It'll be a learning experience.

1109
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:09,880
Stop grinning, kids.

1110
01:33:10,130 --> 01:33:12,340
Are you really sorry about this?

1111
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:24,480
What are you chuckling about?

1112
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:27,070
What am I going to do with you?

1113
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:48,500
Dear! Stop!

1114
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:50,050
What are you doing?

1115
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:53,260
Dear! Stop that!

1116
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:54,930
Don't...

1117
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:57,680
Wait!

1118
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:01,850
No!

1119
01:34:01,930 --> 01:34:03,180
Dear!

1120
01:34:11,570 --> 01:34:13,820
Playing music at a time like this...

1121
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:20,910
What's the matter with you?

1122
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:33,760
Why did you do that, dear?

1123
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:50,520
How dare you!

1124
01:34:57,950 --> 01:35:01,620
Have you even listened
to a song Shinji wrote?

1125
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:05,790
Have you ever seen him perform?

1126
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,340
He was really good, you know.

1127
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:13,250
He was amazing.

1128
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:17,430
What he did was way more important

1129
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:19,890
than just getting good grades.

1130
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:23,220
His music moved a lot of people.

1131
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:27,020
But you have no idea, do you?

1132
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:33,020
Music can teach you a lot about life.

1133
01:35:34,650 --> 01:35:37,280
I learnt that from Shinji.

1134
01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:42,160
Not from you, Dad.

1135
01:35:42,990 --> 01:35:44,080
Shinji was the one who taught me

1136
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:46,040
everything that really mattered!

1137
01:36:47,430 --> 01:36:49,520
What do I do now?

1138
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:32,190
Business is really bad.

1139
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:33,310
Now that the Americans aren't coming

1140
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:35,190
will we have to shut down?

1141
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:36,810
Silly boy.

1142
01:37:37,070 --> 01:37:39,440
We've been through this before.

1143
01:37:40,530 --> 01:37:42,950
So many times...

1144
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:45,320
I lost count.

1145
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:56,290
<i>Here, I'm right beside you</i>

1146
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:04,180
<i>Like a loved one ought to be</i>

1147
01:38:07,430 --> 01:38:09,810
It's your song, right?

1148
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:13,140
It's a good song.

1149
01:38:41,710 --> 01:38:43,170
Hey.

1150
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:48,340
Oh, Mr Matsumura!

1151
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:50,890
Your son's taking over?

1152
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:53,430
He's still in school.

1153
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,890
- Just helping out today.
- I see.

1154
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:57,650
You're a good boy.

1155
01:38:57,730 --> 01:38:58,980
Good luck.

1156
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,280
You don't have to, you know.

1157
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:10,530
Become a fisherman like me, I mean.

1158
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:13,660
You can be what you want.

1159
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:05,360
It's a farewell doll.

1160
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:07,570
Farewell doll?

1161
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:11,200
It's sold on the base.

1162
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:14,200
Soldiers get transferred a lot, right?

1163
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:15,780
So when they leave

1164
01:41:15,870 --> 01:41:18,410
they write messages
on these for each other.

1165
01:41:30,970 --> 01:41:35,640
<i>Dear Mai, Ryota, Kotaro</i>

1166
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:40,430
I'm leaving Okinawa
sooner than expected.

1167
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:43,350
It's a really short time

1168
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,770
but I'm really glad I could
come to Okinawa

1169
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:47,480
to meet you guys.

1170
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:49,860
Even though I'm really sad that

1171
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:52,240
I couldn't see you guys play.

1172
01:41:53,150 --> 01:41:55,780
I remember Shinji had taught me

1173
01:41:55,870 --> 01:41:58,490
an Okinawan expression.

1174
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:03,410
Do you know "ichariba-chode"?

1175
01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:07,290
<i>Icha...</i>

1176
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:09,210
- <i>Ichariba...</i>
- <i>Ichariba...</i>

1177
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:11,090
- <i>Chode.</i>
- <i>Chode?</i>

1178
01:42:11,170 --> 01:42:12,210
Yes.

1179
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:13,880
What does it mean?

1180
01:42:16,890 --> 01:42:18,640
Once we meet...

1181
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:21,720
we're family.

1182
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:24,770
I love this expression!

1183
01:42:28,110 --> 01:42:31,230
Life is a journey.

1184
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:34,650
I was only on this island
by chance this time

1185
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:37,240
but I'll come again

1186
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:41,080
next time to see you guys.

1187
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:44,000
With a passport.

1188
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:46,830
See you again.

1189
01:42:48,830 --> 01:42:53,130
Until then... bye.

1190
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:31,590
<i>Mai: I wrote a song.</i>

1191
01:44:18,510 --> 01:44:19,550
Mai.

1192
01:44:41,610 --> 01:44:45,080
Can guitars be repaired?

1193
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:52,460
Don't bother.

1194
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:02,930
No. I want to fix it.

1195
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:07,520
I want to fix your guitar

1196
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:42,550
New song?

1197
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:45,680
We want to record it.

1198
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,560
And give it to Lisa.

1199
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:49,970
Along with the rest of our songs.

1200
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:53,140
I see.

1201
01:45:53,850 --> 01:45:55,440
Is the new song all finished?

1202
01:45:55,810 --> 01:45:57,060
Yes.

1203
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:01,400
OK, I got it. Let's do it.

1204
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:19,170
Listen, do you want to play a gig?

1205
01:46:19,750 --> 01:46:21,590
I'll get you the space.

1206
01:46:22,050 --> 01:46:24,470
My amends for the other day.

1207
01:46:24,550 --> 01:46:26,590
I'll pay for everything.

1208
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,560
But you're suspended, right?

1209
01:46:32,140 --> 01:46:33,350
Forget it.

1210
01:46:33,430 --> 01:46:36,350
What am I saying? You're suspended.

1211
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:38,980
I'll only get you into more trouble.

1212
01:46:41,730 --> 01:46:43,070
No.

1213
01:46:47,030 --> 01:46:48,570
I'd love to.

1214
01:46:49,410 --> 01:46:50,990
Me, too.

1215
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:53,790
Me, too.

1216
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:56,620
A band has to play live.

1217
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:59,380
That's true. You're right.

1218
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:00,590
Let's do it!

1219
01:47:01,170 --> 01:47:03,170
Include this song too.

1220
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:13,060
What are you doing?

1221
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:15,230
Sorry, ma'am. We'll be done soon.

1222
01:47:15,310 --> 01:47:16,730
Sorry.

1223
01:47:59,230 --> 01:48:00,560
Hey!

1224
01:48:00,730 --> 01:48:02,190
Ready to go!

1225
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:42,440
Maybe she's gone.

1226
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:08,340
Mai... Mai!

1227
01:49:09,130 --> 01:49:10,670
Mai!

1228
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:14,760
Ryota! Kotaro!

1229
01:49:15,550 --> 01:49:16,600
Lisa.

1230
01:49:16,810 --> 01:49:18,680
My brother left a song.

1231
01:49:18,770 --> 01:49:19,810
What?

1232
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:23,400
We named it <i>Sayonara Doll.</i>

1233
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:30,030
We'll play one song for you.

1234
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:31,820
Please listen.

1235
01:49:31,950 --> 01:49:33,320
OK.

1236
01:49:59,770 --> 01:50:05,730
<i>I had a dream</i>

1237
01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:13,490
<i>A long, long dream</i>

1238
01:50:15,990 --> 01:50:21,540
<i>Long ago on this very island</i>

1239
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:29,920
<i>I met you and fell in love</i>

1240
01:50:54,740 --> 01:50:58,490
<i>Like Romeo and Juliet</i>

1241
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:02,790
<i>We were caught in a forbidden romance</i>

1242
01:51:03,950 --> 01:51:07,790
<i>As the world battled around us</i>

1243
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:12,500
<i>We nurtured love in a dance</i>

1244
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:15,720
<i>Reality's unfair, borders</i>

1245
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:17,890
<i>And language raise walls</i>

1246
01:51:17,970 --> 01:51:22,260
<i>Over which love leaps in a bound</i>

1247
01:52:01,470 --> 01:52:05,720
<i>Those who profit from conflict</i>

1248
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:10,400
<i>Leave only pain and malice</i>

1249
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:12,730
<i>Spears raised aloft</i>

1250
01:52:12,810 --> 01:52:15,070
<i>The weak as their shield</i>

1251
01:52:15,530 --> 01:52:20,110
<i>Feeding like flies on the peace</i>

1252
01:52:22,530 --> 01:52:26,790
<i>But never forget our island</i>

1253
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:29,330
<i>And this sea</i>

1254
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:33,880
<i>Over ages and lifetimes and then</i>

1255
01:52:34,170 --> 01:52:38,380
<i>Never forget the song we sang</i>

1256
01:52:38,470 --> 01:52:41,180
<i>And the promise</i>

1257
01:52:41,260 --> 01:52:45,560
<i>That we'll meet again one day</i>

1258
01:52:45,890 --> 01:52:49,980
<i>That we'll meet again one day</i>

1259
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:58,820
<i>Over ages and lifetimes and then</i>

1260
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:56,750
<i>I had a dream</i>

1261
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:05,260
<i>A long, long dream</i>

1262
01:55:41,770 --> 01:55:44,650
I had a buddy

1263
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:46,700
who loved music.

1264
01:55:47,610 --> 01:55:49,240
If he were here

1265
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:51,580
he'd tell us to kick it up a notch!

1266
01:55:52,830 --> 01:55:54,240
So here we go!

1267
01:55:55,410 --> 01:55:56,460
Everybody...

1268
01:55:57,460 --> 01:55:59,330
sing!

1269
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:07,760
<i>When you were so kind to me</i>

1270
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:13,140
<i>I learnt how small I really am</i>

1271
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:18,480
<i>Ashamed for ever doubting you</i>

1272
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:23,940
<i>You've made a believer out of me</i>

1273
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:29,320
<i>The days flow by so quickly</i>

1274
01:56:29,740 --> 01:56:34,910
<i>I drift in an ever-changing world</i>

1275
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:40,120
<i>But one thing that won't budge</i>

1276
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:45,250
<i>Is my love for you</i>

1277
01:56:45,340 --> 01:56:50,340
<i>So don't you cry, my dearest</i>

1278
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:56,060
<i>There's joy in the anguish of love</i>

1279
01:56:56,140 --> 01:57:01,480
<i>Before you know it, you will see</i>

1280
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:06,730
<i>Just how much you mean to me</i>

1281
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:12,160
<i>More today than yesterday we'll be</i>

1282
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:20,580
<i>Before you know it, in my arms</i>

1283
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:28,380
<i>I'd die to see you</i>

1284
01:57:28,460 --> 01:57:31,510
<i>Die to see you</i>

1285
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:39,140
<i>I'd die to see you</i>

1286
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:41,180
<i>Die to see you</i>

1287
01:57:41,270 --> 01:57:43,850
<i>On a sleepless night</i>

1288
01:57:43,940 --> 01:57:46,400
<i>I await you in my dreams</i>

1289
01:57:46,690 --> 01:57:48,860
<i>I'm thinking so hard</i>

1290
01:57:48,940 --> 01:57:51,490
<i>I just can't fall asleep</i>

1291
01:57:52,070 --> 01:57:54,660
<i>But when I see you there</i>

1292
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:57,370
<i>You ask, "Where shall we go?"</i>

1293
01:57:57,450 --> 01:57:59,740
<i>But as long as you're with me</i>

1294
01:57:59,830 --> 01:58:01,580
<i>I don't really care</i>

1295
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:08,800
<i>I'd die to see you</i>

1296
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:12,010
<i>Die to see you</i>

1297
01:58:12,300 --> 01:58:19,560
<i>I'd die to see you</i>

1298
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:22,890
<i>Die to see you</i>

1299
01:58:23,020 --> 01:58:30,320
<i>I'd die to see you</i>

1300
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:32,400
<i>Die to see you</i>

1301
01:58:32,490 --> 01:58:35,110
<i>The time will pass us by</i>

1302
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:37,820
<i>The seasons will depart</i>

1303
01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:40,240
<i>In a world as this</i>

1304
01:58:40,330 --> 01:58:42,790
<i>We strive to understand</i>

1305
01:58:43,290 --> 01:58:45,830
<i>In a world as this</i>

1306
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:48,500
<i>Who we're meant to trust</i>

1307
01:58:48,590 --> 01:58:51,130
<i>Who we're meant to walk with</i>

1308
01:58:51,210 --> 01:58:53,010
<i>So will you take my hand?</i>

1309
01:58:56,550 --> 01:58:58,890
<i>So will you take my hand?</i>

1310
01:59:01,890 --> 01:59:04,850
<i>So will you take my hand?</i>

1311
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:25,710
<i>Little Love Song</i>
