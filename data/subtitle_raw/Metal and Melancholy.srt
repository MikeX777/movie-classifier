1
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,080
The Uruguayans are leading 1-0.

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,840
Penalty. Header by
the keeper.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,640
A free kick for Peru.

4
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,840
Just like a stamp.

5
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,400
The taxi-driver who
took me to the hotel...

6
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,680
said your car was
almost finished.

7
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,040
My car is almost finished.
But I'm not afraid they'll steal it.

8
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,280
This car can't be stolen.

9
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,120
Look...

10
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,160
If the thief opens the door...

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,680
it falls out.

12
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,120
He's startled and runs off.

13
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,040
Or he might get in the car.

14
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,080
You have to connect these
three wires to start it.

15
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,960
I hid them.

16
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,760
What kind of wires?
- A green, a red and a blue one.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,920
What about the other wires?
- They're fake.

18
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,680
The wires confuse them.
- Yes.

19
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,440
They don't know which wires
to connect.

20
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,200
The ignition is also fake.
It doesn't work.

21
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,280
Anyway...

22
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,440
the trunk is empty.
There's nothing to steal.

23
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,920
The number plate is almost
falling off.

24
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,520
Yes.

25
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,280
Anyway, who would steal a car
full of holes?

26
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,720
It must be cold in the winter.
- I stuff a cloth in.

27
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,000
What were you doing?
Was it a breakdown?

28
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
I topped up the water.

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
Every thirty blocks...

30
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,000
I have to add water.
The radiator is bust.

31
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,080
If they steal it, they won't get
further than 30 blocks.

32
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,000
That's the advantage of
this car.

33
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,760
What job do you do?
- Medical publicity.

34
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,440
I wear a tie and carry
a briefcase at work.

35
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,000
METAL AND MELANCHOLY

36
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,360
I work in the international
trade division.

37
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,920
But the economic situation
means...

38
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,360
I have to work as a
taxi-driver now.

39
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,280
How long have you done that?
- About six months.

40
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,400
The crisis got worse and
my family had to eat.

41
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,560
Most people with cars work as
taxi-drivers in their spare time.

42
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,760
Do you enjoy it?
- No. Not at all.

43
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,800
It's not for me.

44
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,280
I wanted to get on and study.

45
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,920
I never thought
I would do this.

46
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,520
I like driving.

47
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,160
But I don't like
playing taxi-driver.

48
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,280
Why is the gear-lever taped?

49
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,480
The situation in Peru is so bad
that many people...

50
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,000
can't keep their hands
to themselves.

51
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,640
Thieves.
- Yes. Thieves.

52
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,360
You have to take measures
to stop them.

53
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,960
One car was stolen from me
and never found.

54
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,880
Why does tape round the gears
stop the thieves?

55
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,120
I remove it at night and
take it home with me.

56
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
Will you stop and show me?

57
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,680
If I stop here,
bullets will fly.

58
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,400
Why? What's here?

59
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,120
Secret police headquarters...
Stopping is banned.

60
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,400
If you stop, they order you
to drive on.

61
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,440
I push the gear-lever down
and take it out.

62
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,160
I crawl under the car every day.
I take this off first.

63
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,520
It's a long one.

64
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,160
Then I push the lever down
and take it out.

65
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,280
I do that every day.

66
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,280
I push it back up
every morning.

67
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,920
I put tape round it...

68
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,160
screw it on and hey presto.

69
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,120
It only takes five minutes.

70
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,360
I save my car in five minutes.

71
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,560
What is that yellow wire?

72
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,600
The horn is broken and
that yellow wire...

73
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,600
is the horn now.

74
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,400
Very ingenious.
- Yes.

75
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,320
You have to be ingenious
to survive this crisis.

76
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,360
That's how it is.

77
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,280
We couldn't make ends meet.

78
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,280
What now, I thought.

79
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,880
I saw lots of men
working as taxi-drivers.

80
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,480
I thought: Why don't I do that?

81
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,720
I said to myself: -

82
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,520
What's the difference,
man or woman?

83
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,120
Sometimes men are
more adventurous.

84
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,480
I said: Okay I'll sit on
my pussy and drive a cab.

85
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,440
And here you are in my taxi.

86
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,280
And is your pussy still
in the right place?

87
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,520
It's right where
it should be.

88
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,440
How long have you done this?
- About a year.

89
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,480
I'm doing well.

90
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,520
But if I had a choice...

91
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,800
I'd take another job.

92
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,400
Meanwhile I love my work.

93
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,800
When last I sought a letter

94
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,760
that I keep lovingly

95
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,320
I found among wilted roses

96
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,440
a photo of her
symbol of my passion

97
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,240
finding that photo
evoked memories

98
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,600
of that far-off time

99
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,400
of days of obsession
desires of tenderness

100
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,840
and intense yearning
for eternal passion

101
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,000
I know that time
has gone for good

102
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,640
that there's no point
in keeping up appearances

103
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,520
the love that binds
two souls together

104
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,920
was slowly lost without
oppression and fear

105
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,720
don't blame fate
that isn't noble

106
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,280
remember you sometimes
make big mistakes

107
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,800
listen to your emotions
and think hard

108
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,600
before you swear:
I love you dearly

109
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,120
When I think what Lima was like,
I get melancholy.

110
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,560
A famous Spanish poet once said:

111
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,680
Peru is made of
metal and melancholy.

112
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
He was right.

113
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,040
Why metal and melancholy?

114
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,640
Maybe because pain and poverty
made us as hard as our metals.

115
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,160
And melancholy because
we are tender too...

116
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,720
and wish for
the good old days.

117
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,480
It's a pity.

118
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,800
The city has as many craters
as the moon.

119
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,360
The taxi-drivers look
like astronauts...

120
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,560
who landed on
a polluted moon.

121
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,400
Our streets are like
your cheeses.

122
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,400
The streets of Lima smell worse
than Dutch cheese.

123
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,200
You feel like an astronaut?

124
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,440
More like a seafarer.

125
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,800
Taxi-drivers are the seafarers
of the 20th century.

126
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,120
We know the city like the sea.

127
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,400
We take the stories everywhere.

128
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,600
We spread news like
the old seafarers.

129
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,480
Thanks to us the Chink
won in 1990.

130
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,640
You mean Fujimori?
- Yes.

131
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,560
We spread the word like
an underground river.

132
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,280
That's why Fuji won.

133
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,360
I CHANGE DOLLARS

134
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,560
Taxi stickers, 50 cents.

135
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,120
How many do you sell a day?
- Ten or 15.

136
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,880
You want one?
- No thanks.

137
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,280
The one on my hat?

138
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,120
No, thanks.

139
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,800
Would you do me a favour?

140
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,000
Could you pay me now.
Then I can fill up.

141
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,680
The tank is almost empty.

142
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,320
You want it in advance?
- It would be better.

143
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,080
Please. We're passing
a gas station.

144
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,840
I can fill up there.

145
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,320
Okay. $ 2, wasn't it?
- Yes. One moment please.

146
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,480
One, two, three Sols.
- One moment, please.

147
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,720
How much?
- Ten dollars.

148
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,640
Diaries...

149
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,880
They're expensive.

150
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,840
Your car's a nice colour.
- Green. The colour of hope.

151
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,880
We hope things will improve
in our country.

152
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,120
You cannot say there's
no work.

153
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,880
Only lazy people can
say that.

154
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,480
We have to try to earn
an honest living.

155
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,640
Do you have another job?

156
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,680
Yes, with the Ministry
of Justice.

157
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,960
I work in the management...

158
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,960
of an internal control
department.

159
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,640
I like the work, but
can't make ends meet.

160
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:44,200
How much do you earn?
- About 200 dollars.

161
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,920
At the present exchange rate.

162
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,400
I can't survive.
I have a lovely family.

163
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,160
Whose is the shoe?
- My youngest daughter's.

164
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,480
How old is she?
- Two.

165
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,760
A prodigy.
- What?

166
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,120
She's a prodigy. Fantastic.

167
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,320
She exceeds all
my expectations.

168
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,640
She is quick and intelligent.
She's like her mother.

169
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,080
How old is her mother?
- 32.

170
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,280
But love is for all ages.

171
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,560
To love and be loved is great.

172
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,920
But it's terrible if
your love isn't answered.

173
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,000
This is my house.

174
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,520
Hello Mili. How's my little
girl?

175
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,440
This is my wife Luisa,
and my youngest, so far.

176
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Her name is Militza Lilibet.

177
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,360
She's a darling too.
Her name is Cintia Luisa.

178
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,360
And the oldest: Alfredo Líner.

179
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,720
There's lots of love
in this little house...

180
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,320
even if there's
no money.

181
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,000
Take a seat.
- Thank you.

182
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,280
When the lights go out
we make the best of things.

183
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,400
It's crazy, but this little
bulb gives us light.

184
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,880
When they cut off the power,
we turn that lamp on.

185
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,280
We have light all evening.

186
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,560
It makes us even happier.

187
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,240
We're nearly there.
It's the house on the corner...

188
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,280
with the palm tree out front.

189
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,440
That's it.

190
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,760
I'm renovating it to live here
with my family.

191
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,560
I teach at the aviation academy.

192
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,280
I retired from the air-force.

193
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,280
I pass on my knowledge to
officers in training.

194
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,040
This is the living room.
We can open the shutters.

195
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,920
What do you teach?
- Military science.

196
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,160
That's what I studied.

197
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,520
It's badly paid, but
gives satisfaction.

198
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,600
I stay in touch with my friends
and colleagues.

199
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,320
Come this way.

200
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,600
These rooms are
pretty neglected.

201
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,440
In better days this was
part of a table.

202
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,160
A huge table for
about 17 people.

203
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,160
Here you see...

204
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,800
an extension.

205
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,760
You see how big the table was.

206
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,040
It was huge.
This is half.

207
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,400
And the chest of drawers?
- There was a lovely chest here.

208
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,640
You can see the marks
on the wall.

209
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,040
19th century mahogany
wood-carving.

210
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,480
When my aunt died...

211
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,720
the heir took the chest.

212
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,360
Now I use this as a work-table.

213
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,880
Are they bags of nuts?
- Yes.

214
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,760
Why so many?

215
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,520
Sometimes my car's out of
action.

216
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,040
Then I buy 100 or 150 kilo
of nuts...

217
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,200
and roast them here.

218
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,800
This is an Italian fryer...

219
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,080
with revolving baskets.

220
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,920
So the nuts are roasted evenly.

221
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,920
And I use this machine...

222
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,240
to seal the bags of nuts.

223
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,760
I have a car.

224
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,560
So I can deliver the nuts
to schools and shops.

225
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,440
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

226
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,880
Only 20 dollars.

227
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,160
I want to ask you something.

228
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,600
I hope you don't mind.

229
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,000
You know the situation is
very difficult here.

230
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,160
The economy is in a mess.
There's high unemployment.

231
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,840
I wanted to ask if you...

232
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,840
Sorry. One moment...

233
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,720
I have ballpoints. No Parkers,
but they write as well.

234
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,320
I have piles of pens.
- Pity.

235
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,080
I also have these cakes.
They're deadly.

236
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,520
My wife bakes them.
They're filled with marzipan.

237
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,120
Real marzipan, not fake.

238
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,520
They're my favourites.
How much are they?

239
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,200
We'll work it out later.

240
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,280
With the credit card?
- Right. Caramba.

241
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,400
I'll buy them.

242
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,120
It's pretty embarrassing, but...

243
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,040
I'm a taxi-driver and actor.

244
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,360
Actor?
- Yes, for film and TV.

245
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,000
Film? Then we're colleagues.
- Sure.

246
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,800
What films did you act in?
- You know Francisco Lombardi?

247
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,720
Francisco Pancho Lombardi.
- I have seen a few of his films.

248
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,800
I did "Death in the Morning"
with him.

249
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,840
I played a prison director.
You know the film?

250
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,040
I haven't seen that one.

251
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,000
Then I played a salesman
in "lmmoral Stories".

252
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,400
And a film about guerillas:
"Warn the Compañeros".

253
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,600
I played General Elosio Parra.

254
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,080
You feel okay as a general?

255
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,320
Well, they often ask me for
such roles.

256
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,600
In the TV series "Gamboa"
I was General Peralta...

257
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,360
head of the secret service.

258
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:38,240
I was also a taxi-driver
in "Maruja in Hell".

259
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:45,000
Then I played in "The City
and the Dogs".

260
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,960
Based on the novel by Vargas
Llosa?

261
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,960
Yes. Made by Lombardi.

262
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,480
Which role?
- Father of The Slave.

263
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,200
The cadet who's severely wounded.

264
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,280
I visit my son in hospital.

265
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,280
I wonder why they don't instruct
the boys better...

266
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,840
and how the accident could
happen.

267
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,280
I ask Pablo Serra, a cadet
from the same class...

268
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,240
to drink a cup of
coffee with me.

269
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,960
We drink coffee and
I burst into tears.

270
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,480
I cry like this, with
my glasses on my nose.

271
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,880
I cry because my son was shot.

272
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,240
It's his mother's fault.

273
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,680
Real tears, or glycerine?
- I really cried.

274
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,640
I concentrate to cry.
And I talk about my son.

275
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,160
That his mother always
treated him like a girl.

276
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,240
That she bought dolls for him.
I wanted him to be a man.

277
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,400
That's why I sent him
to military academy.

278
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,400
What a mess. I was the father.

279
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,920
You almost cried for real.
- Maybe, maybe.

280
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,160
What do you think?
We're colleagues.

281
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,440
Taxi, taxi. Only a dollar.

282
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,000
Buy something, please.

283
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,640
A pyramid for energy.

284
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,720
Cigarettes.

285
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,960
Elephant.

286
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,720
Pyramid.

287
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,000
Crocodile.

288
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,360
Cigarettes, madam?

289
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,280
Go away.
- What?

290
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,920
Go away. I don't want candy.

291
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,920
I only want to sell one.
Or two?

292
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,480
What's your name?
- Jorge.

293
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,200
I'm a tradesman.

294
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,440
The middle classes have
gone downhill.

295
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,600
The crisis started at
the turn of the century.

296
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,120
In the course of history,
the governments...

297
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,960
have bankrupted the country.

298
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,240
And between '85 and '90,
the last Apra government...

299
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,600
let the country go
to the dogs.

300
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,600
The governments were
ignorant and weak...

301
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,840
but above all corrupt.

302
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,560
When president Alan García
decided that Peru...

303
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,720
would stop paying off
the foreign debt...

304
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,480
he knew a blockade
was inevitable.

305
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,960
That foreign credits
would be impounded...

306
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,640
in the European banks.

307
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,240
He wanted to transfer
the money to other banks.

308
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,960
That way it couldn't be
impounded.

309
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,240
He put together the scheme...

310
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,720
to get commission.

311
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,360
The banks give commission if
money is transferred their way.

312
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,000
That commission is between
1 and 5% . Let's say 1%.

313
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,160
Over a sum of...

314
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,280
about 1.2 billion dollars...

315
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,520
Peru's international reserve
at the time...

316
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,680
that is 12 million dollars.

317
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,440
Did Alan García put 12 million
in his pocket?

318
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,520
He must have taken
at least 12 million.

319
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,560
That's why we're in such
a bad way. We're bankrupt.

320
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,840
Sir, please...

321
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,320
Take another car.
I have nothing.

322
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,240
Here, take it.
- Thank you.

323
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,520
Screw politics.

324
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,400
They keep us poor.

325
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,680
We live as beasts.

326
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,360
They strangle us.

327
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,880
Sod off.

328
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,040
Damn it.

329
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:24,760
We Peruvians have
a shit life.

330
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,560
What does life have to offer?

331
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,120
Hardly anything.

332
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,000
Fuck. The damn car's
broken down again.

333
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,080
I take it to the garage every
day. Now it's broken down again.

334
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,600
What are you doing here?

335
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,760
We're making a film for
Dutch TV.

336
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,880
You have permission?
- Yes.

337
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,640
In order.
- Thank you.

338
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,040
What's the film about?
- About taxi-drivers in Lima.

339
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,760
I'm a taxi-driver too.
You want to film me?

340
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,040
I wanted to work after
leaving school.

341
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,720
I had relatives in the police
so I joined too.

342
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,840
How old were you?
- 16. Just left school.

343
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,600
You wanted to work.
- Yes.

344
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,280
I wanted to be independent
of my family.

345
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,320
I always wanted to
look after myself.

346
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,520
I wanted to show people
I could manage alone.

347
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,600
I applied to the secret service
and was accepted.

348
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,600
You joined the "PIP"?
- The PIP or the "rayas".

349
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,680
The rayas or the "tiras".
- Something like that.

350
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,000
After the fish "raya"?

351
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:44,320
No. Raya: A straight line which
doesn't veer to left or right.

352
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,520
But always goes North.

353
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,120
Almost impossible.

354
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,240
Yes. That's why there are
so many bad policemen.

355
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,760
And their salary is too low.

356
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,720
When I was a student,
we laughed at the PIPs.

357
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,720
They were always buried in a
paper and had very short hair.

358
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,440
Everyone knew they were PIPs.

359
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:12,160
That must have been in '75?
- No, earlier.

360
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,560
I was also given a chance
to be an informer once...

361
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,080
during the teachers' strike.

362
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,200
I enlisted at the Guadelupe
school.

363
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,240
I was 17 and didn't look
like a secret agent.

364
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,600
I wore a school uniform
and went to school.

365
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,800
I sat in the classroom again.

366
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,400
I found out which teachers
were subversive.

367
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,880
I had to inform on
the subversive teachers.

368
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,000
They were wrong to break
windows...

369
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,240
and set cars alight.
I shopped those teachers.

370
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,040
I agreed with the ideas
of some of the others.

371
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,840
Because the teacher has to
educate our youth.

372
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,120
They rightly demanded higher
wages and better accommodation.

373
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,440
So you decided which of them
was good or bad?

374
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,720
I decided what was
subversive or just.

375
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,400
How could you distinguish?

376
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,400
A policeman isn't an animal
or machine.

377
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,760
He's human, like everyone.

378
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,480
He feels and thinks
like other people.

379
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,200
He is part of society
and fits in.

380
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,800
I serve people too with
my work as taxi-driver.

381
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,440
How many hours a day?
- About 8 hours.

382
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,640
Driving a taxi is better than
the PIP?

383
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,680
No, but you earn more.

384
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:11,880
As a policeman I earned less
than as a taxi-driver.

385
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,120
Now I work when I want and
take time off when I like.

386
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,280
I have more time for my family.

387
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,840
I'd have preferred to stay a
policeman...

388
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,760
and keep the car for myself.

389
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,760
I do this work to eat and live.

390
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,560
Finished.

391
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,120
All the loose bits on your car
make salsa music.

392
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,240
Don't you want a new one?

393
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,080
I have bad experiences
with new cars.

394
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,640
I was shot and wounded when
my last car was stolen.

395
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,320
With this car I can drive taxi
and meet great people.

396
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,040
People who are now my friends.

397
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,080
I have a friend living near
here.

398
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,960
They call him the Chinaman.

399
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,040
He and his son have a taxi.
Great people.

400
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:34,080
During the armed strike in
July...

401
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,680
By Shining Path?

402
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,680
The armed strike by
Shining Path...

403
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,280
some taxi-drivers kept
working.

404
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:49,000
What's an armed strike?
- When everyone stays home.

405
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,280
On the orders of Shining Path?
- Yes.

406
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,560
If you went out on the street
you could be murdered...

407
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,400
or have a bomb explode
beside you.

408
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,720
But that man...

409
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,520
needed the money badly.

410
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,160
The Chinaman's son
drove taxi that day.

411
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:22,960
He was shot dead in
a slum area.

412
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,000
Who did it?

413
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,440
His father and the police said
it was two terrorists.

414
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,120
They flagged down the taxi,
he stopped and they shot him.

415
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,920
He was unlucky that day.

416
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,720
Is his father still
a taxi-driver?

417
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,240
He looks after his son's family
and drives a taxi.

418
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:05,240
It's the only way
for him to survive.

419
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,000
The Chinaman is
very miserable.

420
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,600
His son was about 34.
A grown man.

421
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,160
That day, it was
his turn to lose.

422
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,680
Today the court martial
confirmed the life sentence...

423
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,160
on Abimael Guzman,
leader of the Shining Path...

424
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,640
and two other terrorists.

425
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:20,840
They have to pay a fine
of 25 million dollars.

426
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,000
I need air.

427
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,400
You kicked the tyre.

428
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,440
To feel it.

429
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,240
My foot rebounded.

430
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:36,000
Then I know how much air
is in the tyre.

431
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,040
You can feel that?
- I've kicked tyres for years.

432
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,760
How long have you had the taxi?

433
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,560
I've worked full-time
since 1984.

434
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,960
It was late December and
I was pretty busy.

435
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,800
On New Year's Eve I started work
after lunch.

436
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,120
I had lots of customers.

437
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,120
I went on working...

438
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,560
till midnight, 1 am.

439
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,400
I was hungry, went home and ate.

440
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,000
I grabbed some chocolate
and coca leaves.

441
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,720
I ate the chocolate and
chewed the coca leaves.

442
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,480
Why coca?

443
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,480
It banishes sleep and hunger.
You feel fit.

444
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,720
I chewed coca with chocolate.

445
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,160
I wasn't sleepy and kept
working.

446
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,680
Did you earn a lot?
- Bags of money.

447
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,320
I took it home and
went back to work.

448
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:23,120
I kept going until 10 am...

449
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,520
on 1 January 1985.

450
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,040
You still chew coca?
- No.

451
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,680
I don't need to. If there
was enough work I would.

452
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,800
In the mountains, in
a village of 33 houses...

453
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,760
where the people breed
like rabbits...

454
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,560
I learnt to chew
coca with chocolate.

455
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,960
The coca tastes awful
without it.

456
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,640
Most families had
about 8 children.

457
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,280
Of those eight,
2 or 3 might survive.

458
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:15,920
Some mothers made their children
work when they were 13.

459
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,840
They kept going with coca.

460
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,160
Why bring us here?

461
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,800
Because I know Lima well
and this is Lima too.

462
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,960
I don't like this show.

463
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,920
It's All Saints and look:
The day to fill your belly.

464
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,240
Where are you taking me
in the cemetery?

465
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:46,680
To door 6.
The communal grave.

466
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,640
Where's the grave?
- At the back.

467
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,720
Aren't you afraid of death?
- No.

468
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,960
Once I fell off a roof
in Chanchamayo.

469
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,800
I felt something strange.

470
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:01,080
I saw the people and
felt a stabbing pain.

471
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:06,160
I felt something leave me
for an invisible place.

472
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,280
I felt a kind of void.

473
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:16,160
I saw my body and
the people around me.

474
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,880
You saw your own body?
- Yes, but I didn't understand.

475
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,760
The doctor gave me a slap,
I reacted...

476
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,600
and felt a terrible pain.

477
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:33,120
When the doctor came, my heart
had stopped beating, he said.

478
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,920
Since then I have changed.

479
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,040
I am no longer afraid of death.

480
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,280
Anyway, it's better there.

481
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,360
Where?
- On the other side.

482
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,840
You know: The other side, death.

483
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,360
There's no pain there.

484
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:09,520
When my body returned,
I felt a terrible pain.

485
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,880
There you're free,
completely free.

486
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,960
Are you free there?

487
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,560
Yes. It means freedom.
You can move faster.

488
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,440
Faster? Without the taxi?
- Yes, without the taxi.

489
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,720
You walk around and look.

490
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,800
It's a great feeling.

491
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,040
You feel free of tension.

492
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,280
Like the tension I felt...

493
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,960
when I opened my eyes
and thought: What happened?

494
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,160
The unidentified bodies
are in this grave.

495
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,960
After a fatal accident, the body
is taken to the mortuary.

496
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,440
If the family doesn't come within
a fortnight, it's brought here.

497
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:15,720
The body has a number plate
on the wrist.

498
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,520
Sometimes the family
turns up after a month.

499
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:27,320
They recognise the person and
drag him out to bury him.

500
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,480
This is were we all end
and I'm not afraid.

501
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,160
You asked if I was afraid
of death. No I'm not.

502
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,720
I don't believe you.

503
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,320
The smell is still in my nose.
- It lasts a few days.

504
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,280
The smell is in your nose hairs.
You have to clean your nose.

505
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:08,280
Not with cotton wool, but
with your own sweaty clothes.

506
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,520
A trick?

507
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:15,280
No, a doctor taught me.

508
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:40,320
A difficult route. No power,
so no traffic lights.

509
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,560
I have a son of 13.
You have children?

510
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,200
I have three. The eldest,
Rodrigo, is seven.

511
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:02,840
Laurita is five and
Rodolfito is three.

512
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:08,440
Laurita is sick. She's receiving
oncological treatment.

513
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,240
What is that?

514
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:17,280
When she was three, she had
cancer in her blood.

515
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,600
Lymphatic leukaemia. That seems
to be the most positive form.

516
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,400
It has the best prognosis.

517
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,480
She has a lumbar puncture
every three months...

518
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,160
and blood tests every month.

519
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,440
We have to be very careful
with her.

520
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,880
If she has a cold she must
go straight to hospital.

521
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,680
Not every doctor can treat her.

522
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,760
She is often in hospital.
- Painful and costly too.

523
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,440
Yes, exorbitant.

524
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:03,160
When she fell ill,
I could still afford it.

525
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,120
Now it's difficult.
It's expensive.

526
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,840
Tomorrow there's another test
with a general anaesthetic.

527
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:21,280
I don't have money for medicines.
That's why I drive a taxi.

528
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,320
Otherwise I can't manage.

529
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,360
How is she now?
- It looks good.

530
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:34,040
Once it was almost too late.
Her larynx was blocked.

531
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:44,160
She had mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation and oxygen.

532
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,560
But it was all right.

533
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:56,800
She has built up a lot of
resistance. She's a fighter.

534
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:01,760
I'm crazy about my girl.
She's only five.

535
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,160
A girl of five, a fighter?

536
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,640
Yes, she's easy.

537
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,080
If her little brother takes
her toy...

538
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,600
she plays with something
else.

539
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,920
Where does the fight
come from?

540
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,000
When she fell ill, we didn't
know what would happen.

541
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,560
You know cancer
means death.

542
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:35,720
We didn't know how it would end.
We were afraid and sad.

543
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:43,200
We had to tell her
life was worthwhile.

544
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,920
We had to encourage her to live.

545
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:52,840
Because anaesthetics and
daily injections and tests...

546
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,440
are unbearable for
a girl of three.

547
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,880
She had to discover
her own strength.

548
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,160
We could only give her love...

549
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,080
and tell her how important
she was to us.

550
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:16,000
That we wanted to keep
her with us.

551
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,440
That she could do so much.
Play with her dolls...

552
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,040
go to the beach, walk.

553
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,920
We wanted her to understand...

554
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:33,240
that there were better things
than lying in hospital.

555
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,480
At a certain point...

556
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,800
medicines made her dislike...

557
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,560
meat and fish.

558
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,840
Other things she did like.

559
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:53,520
She ate snacks and
things in tins and plastic.

560
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,600
We brought her packed food.
No, thank you.

561
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,560
On the way back?
- Yes, on the way back.

562
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,440
She had stuffed herself once
and I said:

563
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,320
"Laurita, you have a surprise?"
"No, Daddy," she said.

564
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:15,560
"But your belly is so fat."
"No nothing."

565
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:22,640
"Will I be a grandpa?
Are you having a baby?"

566
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:28,760
"Great, I'll be a grandpa
and you'll be a mummy."

567
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:35,280
"You'll go walking with the baby
and buy toys for Christmas."

568
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,880
And she laughed.

569
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:43,040
I wanted to tell her there
were so many nice things.

570
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,440
That life was worthwhile
despite the pain.

571
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,240
That she had to persevere.

572
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,680
I wanted my daughter
to keep fighting.

573
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:05,920
She had to know there's
a positive side to suffering.

574
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,440
Life is hard, but beautiful.

575
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,200
How old is your car?
- From '58.

576
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,440
Respect your elder.

577
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,200
A Volkswagen.
- A Cheeky Beetle.

578
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,120
Another one.

579
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,960
Nothing can happen to you
in this car.

580
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,880
You'll come out alive
if it rolls over.

581
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,520
A kind of bunker.
- None better.

582
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,960
You can even drive
in your sleep.

583
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:12,320
Are you divorced?
Or weren't you married?

584
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,440
What's your story?

585
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,240
A long love story.
We started young.

586
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,840
Our love lasted for a long time.
For 13 years.

587
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,520
Later he started to change.

588
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,320
Then I became pregnant,
unfortunately.

589
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:42,280
Who was he?
- The father of my son.

590
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:47,560
As good-looking as you?
- Handsome and irresponsible.

591
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,720
I had a great time.

592
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,440
You live life to the full
when you're young.

593
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,040
You want to enjoy life and
succumb to your emotions.

594
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,360
We lived life intensely.

595
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,280
We travelled a lot and
had great fun.

596
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,600
We were popular at parties.
We were happy.

597
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:19,040
When I went out with him,
I felt like a queen.

598
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:23,480
He always said I was the
most beautiful and sweetest.

599
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,960
We were cheerful and
always had fun.

600
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:43,040
That's how time passed until
I found out he was deceiving me.

601
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:47,840
I decided to leave him.
But I was five months pregnant.

602
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,400
We stayed together for the child.

603
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,280
He offered to marry me.

604
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:01,080
But that was no answer for me.

605
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:04,800
He still hadn't changed.

606
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,400
Marriage isn't the only way
to be happy.

607
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,240
You can't be happy if
there's no respect.

608
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,760
Did you stay on your own?
- Yes.

609
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,320
I am both father and mother.

610
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:25,720
I live with my father. He's 85.

611
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:31,520
He never accepted me
as unmarried mother.

612
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,320
He keeps trying to kick us out.

613
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,840
Especially when he drinks.

614
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,360
Sunday he hits the bottle.

615
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:52,440
We have to run for our lives.

616
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,360
Eat up quick and get out.

617
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:03,040
He doesn't accept I am
an unmarried mother.

618
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,560
He won't forgive me.

619
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,720
He can't see I'm father
and mother to my child...

620
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,320
and that I earn our keep.

621
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:20,840
He doesn't care if I'm
a good mother and daughter.

622
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:29,120
He keeps insulting me.

623
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:39,480
You look after your father and
son and take children to school?

624
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,320
I get up at six.

625
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:49,880
I shower and make sandwiches
for my son.

626
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,080
I run to fetch the car.

627
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,480
After breakfast I take
children to school.

628
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,520
At eight I drive my taxi.

629
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,720
By 11:30 I need to make enough money
to go shopping.

630
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,200
Then I go to the market.

631
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,800
Then I clear up and cook.

632
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:22,280
At 1:30 school's out and
I fetch the children.

633
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:30,600
In the afternoon I do
the washing and cleaning.

634
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:34,200
From 5 to 8 I drive
the taxi again.

635
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:40,520
That's how time passes with...

636
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:48,760
With all that, do you have time
to laugh in between?

637
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:54,120
However busy it is,
I keep dancing.

638
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:59,920
I wash, iron, cook...
But I keep dancing.

639
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:05,400
I dance all the time.
I'd have liked a dance school.

640
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,280
I'm mad about dancing and music.

641
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,520
Sometimes my son says:
Mum, I want to watch TV.

642
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:17,200
Darling, I want to dance.
To my last breath.

643
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,680
I'm mad about dancing and music.

644
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,320
I dance when I cry.
I dance when I cook.

645
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:31,400
Whether I'm sad or glad,
music rules my life.

646
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,960
That's how I cope with life.

647
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,360
Here it is.

648
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,120
Thanks. How much is it.

649
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,760
Two dollars, madam.

650
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,840
Thank you, madam.

651
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:43,560
Can we make a portrait of you?
- Of course. I'd love to.

652
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,960
A portrait. Why not?

653
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,120
I thank you for taking my photo.

654
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:01,760
How old is your car?
- It's from '63.

655
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,440
Almost 30 years old.
- 29.

656
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,800
Next year he'll be 30.

657
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,880
Will you celebrate?
- Of course.

658
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,880
He's been my partner for
30 years.

659
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,800
You have to celebrate that.

660
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:25,080
How will you celebrate?
- Pour champagne over him.

661
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,960
I hope he'll stay with me.

662
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:35,120
"Brother," I say, "behave
yourself.

663
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,680
Run. Don't desert me."

664
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:42,200
He keeps running.
We always manage.

665
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:48,680
If you talk to him?
- Lf I say "brother", he goes.

666
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:53,440
Sometimes he stutters a bit.
But we always make it.

667
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,360
We're a wreck,
but we make it.

668
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,880
Magic.
- Fantastic.

669
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:08,400
We're both fantastic.
"We made it, brother," I say.

670
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,960
He knows your voice?
- Yes.

671
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,840
It's as if he listens to me.
Incredible.

672
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,160
He seems to understand me.

673
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,320
I tell him things. But maybe
you don't believe me.

674
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,480
What do you tell him?

675
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:37,400
Sometimes I sing a song
for him. Listen:

676
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,520
I'm not from here
I come from Trujillo

677
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:46,720
no one worries about me
I worry about no one

678
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:52,480
I'm going to Trujillo
and not coming back

679
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:02,400
We sing and ride
and stumble home.

680
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:06,280
Your voice encourages him.
- Yes.

681
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:11,880
If he doesn't want to start,
I say: You're lazy, aren't you?

682
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,480
Just start. And he starts.

683
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:22,800
After lots of clanking
and zooming, he starts.

684
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,280
When he's broken down, I get
headache and fever.

685
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,960
You and the car are one.

686
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:38,880
Incredible. If he stops,
I'll stop too.

687
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,920
It looks as if we'll
grow old together.

688
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,200
Grey and wrinkled.

689
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:51,200
And with no windows.
The windows's bust.

690
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:56,040
There's no glass in it.

691
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:29,720
Long ago I was in love
with a foreigner.

692
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,640
Her name was Marlene.

693
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:41,000
An Italian visiting Peru
for the first time.

694
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,520
We went to the beach and
had lots of fun.

695
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,080
I was poor and I don't know
where I got the money.

696
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,880
After a fortnight she said
she had to go back to Italy.

697
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:07,320
She said to me:
I'll take you with me.

698
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:13,680
For better or worse,
I'll take you too.

699
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,840
The last evening we
went to a hotel.

700
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,760
We took a bottle of
whisky with us.

701
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:29,000
We drank and were cheerful
all night.

702
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:35,160
We cried in the morning.
Because she went and I stayed.

703
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,600
I took her to the airport.

704
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:49,440
The farewell was sentimental,
sad.

705
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:55,680
You know how hard
farewells can be.

706
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:59,160
I said to her: Marlene,
you know...

707
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,640
that our love is impossible.

708
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,040
I can't come to you.

709
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,800
And something else, I said.

710
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,520
You can't mix water and oil.

711
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,480
Because she was white
and you're brown?

712
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,040
That's right.

713
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:27,080
If I had gone to Italy
with her...

714
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:32,040
what would her parents
have said of me?

715
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:41,320
I thought of so many things.

716
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:47,120
The moment had come
to say farewell.

717
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:53,240
She didn't want to get in.
I had to come with her.

718
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,560
The plane was about to leave.

719
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:00,080
It was already delayed 5
minutes.

720
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,160
Then her name was called.

721
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,240
And she left.

722
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:14,640
It was a sad farewell
for both of us.

723
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:19,560
I never saw her again.

724
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,600
How will she be now?
She knows nothing of me either.

725
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:31,480
I didn't get any more letters.
Nothing at all.

726
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:43,680
I still have a memento of her.

727
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:50,840
We heard this song in
the village where we were.

728
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:55,400
It is a <i>pasillo</i> from Ecuador.

729
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:00,280
I always have the cassette with
me. My only memento of her.

730
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,680
You want to hear it?

731
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,240
Every day that passes

732
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,280
every hour and every minute

733
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,400
I feel I love you

734
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,920
love you more and more

735
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:49,680
no distance or time

736
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:53,480
no saints in the church

737
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:57,960
can stop me saying

738
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:02,240
I love you

739
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:32,360
darling, I love you

740
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,960
with heart and soul

741
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,480
I love you truly

742
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,560
I love you so much

743
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,760
that's why in the world

744
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:53,400
there's no one and nothing

745
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,960
to stop me saying

746
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,320
I love you

747
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,880
Translated by Martin Cleaver

748
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,440
That's my memento of her.
