1
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:05,038
(skateboard rolling)

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,779
(light music)

3
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,899
- Dispatch, gimme a
description of that subject

4
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,934
with the theft earlier
at the liquor store.

5
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,038
- [Dispatch] Unit 515,
I have a white suspect,

6
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,041
bearded, five foot
seven, torn shirt,

7
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:45,111
needs to be brought
in for questioning.

8
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,414
- I got a male subject
matchin' that description.

9
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,115
He's goin' eastbound
down the railroad tracks,

10
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,684
looks like he's gonna cut
through the fence line

11
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,186
over there, I'm
gonna make contact.

12
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,956
Go ahead and send another
unit this way, please.

13
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,265
(siren blaring)

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,602
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

15
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:10,703
On the ground, on the
ground, on the ground.

16
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,871
Get on the ground.

17
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,973
Why you coming through?
- Ow! (exclaiming)

18
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,308
Why are you coming through?

19
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,209
- [Suspect] I...

20
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,477
- Hmm?

21
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,611
- [Suspect] I was
comin' from the woods,

22
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,879
I don't know where I am.

23
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,281
- [Cop] Anybody come in
here, take it slow now,

24
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,248
take it slow now.
- I don't know where I am,

25
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,184
I'm just trying to get home.

26
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,453
(groaning)

27
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,255
Come on, is this necessary?
- Relax, relax.

28
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,825
You saw me comin' through
over on the railroad tracks.

29
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:32,759
You cut through on
the railroad tracks

30
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,260
you came through the woods.

31
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,831
- I don't know where I am, I'm
just trying to find a place.

32
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,100
I'm coming from the
woods, I don't know.

33
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,368
We went to a campground,
me and my friends,

34
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,504
I got into a fight
with a couple there,

35
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,706
my friends bailed,
I can't find them,

36
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,609
I can't find my car, I can't
find my phone, nothing.

37
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,678
I just need to get home.

38
00:01:57,116 --> 00:02:00,220
(cell phone buzzing)

39
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:13,666
- Honey, let me call you back.

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,736
I'm right in the middle
of something here.

41
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,572
Okay, just tape
my show, alright?

42
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:24,177
What he hell do you mean
the DVR's already full?

43
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,747
Well delete some of
your Castles, alright?

44
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:33,119
Look, I paid for the
damn DVR, you got it?

45
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,654
No, I'm gonna call
you back, I promise,

46
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,323
but just tape my show, alright?

47
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,593
Please.

48
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,765
Alright, thank you,
I'll call you back.

49
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,573
(chuckling)

50
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,208
- Tape my damn show, woman!

51
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,776
Tape my damn show!

52
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,711
(laughing)

53
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,447
- It's just you and
I down here, alright?

54
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,917
I'm not a big fan of your odds.

55
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,984
- I'm sorry.

56
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:11,291
Life's just like one
gigantic inside joke lately,

57
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,125
that's all.

58
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,760
- Well I like jokes.

59
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,261
Explain it to me.

60
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:20,066
- Alright, sit back,
this one's a doozy.

61
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,535
(soft music)

62
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,408
- What is this kid doing?

63
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,710
(laughing)

64
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:41,955
(tires squeal)

65
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,957
- Are you kidding me?

66
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,024
I'll kill you.

67
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,993
Get off the phone!

68
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,996
(tires screeching)

69
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,934
- Mm hmm.

70
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,070
Nope, fire away, I'm gettin'
emails left and right.

71
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,639
Nothing's gonna stop
me at this point.

72
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,540
Yeah?

73
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,910
Okay, so what are we doing
about the cake though?

74
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:08,381
Is that coming on time or do
like we have a status on that?

75
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,016
No, absolutely not.

76
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,018
Honey, not you.

77
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,787
You, this shirt, not happening.

78
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:15,722
Huh uh.

79
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,090
Back, back back back back back.

80
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,658
Get that one I bought for you.

81
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,727
- You know I almost got
hit by a truck today.

82
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,961
Life's a little too short--

83
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,697
- Excuse me, hold on.
- for the perfect shirt.

84
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,000
- The cake will be
there an hour early?

85
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,735
(scoffing and groaning)

86
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,204
Okay I need this to
look like someone caring

87
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,673
planned my anniversary party.

88
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:37,210
Yeah, no I'm getting like the
opposite of care from you.

89
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,778
I'm not quite sure of
the word but I want like

90
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,514
Care Bear, like,
squeeze, hug, support me.

91
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,983
What I'm getting is, I don't
have any of these things ready.

92
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,952
No, the details matter.

93
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,790
Don't talk to me like I'm crazy.

94
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,458
Okay, I have to go.

95
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,596
(sighs)

96
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,501
See this, this I wanna
rip off of you later.

97
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,502
(chuckling)

98
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,736
Your neck is--

99
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,271
- Fat, don't touch it.

100
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,172
- Yeah.

101
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,710
I have to call the DJ back.
- Oh my gosh.

102
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,782
- Three new emails?

103
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,150
Over one phone call?

104
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,484
Oh ho, come on.

105
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,754
What was his number?

106
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,190
Hello?

107
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,024
Pen.

108
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,359
Hello?

109
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,960
Yes, DJ Teddy Arskin?

110
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:28,861
Gimme.

111
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,766
Hi, this is Jack Gout speaking.

112
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,436
Yes hi, hello, who do I
make this check out to?

113
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,770
I'm assuming it's
(buzzing)

114
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,539
not DJ Teddy Arskin.

115
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,511
Donkey Punch Productions?

116
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:49,482
Okay.

117
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,585
Yeah, thank you.

118
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:53,920
I don't get it.

119
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,223
- Too much?

120
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,991
- No, you look masculine.

121
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,193
- I always look masculine.

122
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,561
- [Jack] Hmm.

123
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,396
- (laughing) What
do you mean, hmm?

124
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,765
- When I see you at
this party tonight

125
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,634
I'm gonna be looking
at the new head of PR

126
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,336
at the Chicago Cubs.

127
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:15,308
And then we can finally put
an offer in on the house.

128
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,847
You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

129
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,381
- I love this hat.

130
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:26,586
You look really sexy, like
a man, like a man gorilla.

131
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,221
(imitates snarling)
Gimme this little neck.

132
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,623
I wanna bite it
like a piece of ham.

133
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,759
(laughing)
(smack resounding)

134
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,161
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

135
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,898
But seriously Teddy.
- Uh huh.

136
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,635
- Susan, this event
planner, cannot, cannot.

137
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,572
- This is everything, Ted.

138
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,840
The Chicago Cubs?

139
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,542
You remember when they
won the World Series?

140
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,310
- That was 1908, do you, Jacob?

141
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,147
- Well, listen, all
I'm sayin', pal,

142
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,149
is this is their year

143
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,552
and we are the marketing
team behind it.

144
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,888
- See this?

145
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,625
This right here is everything
I've been working towards.

146
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,627
This is what the
promotion gets me.

147
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,861
Okay?

148
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,496
I remember when
I met my husband,

149
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,532
right at this table, right here.

150
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,668
- You two met here,
over cinnamon rolls?

151
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,137
- It was the end of
the night for him,

152
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,540
it was the beginning
of the morning for me,

153
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,009
and I just, I'll never forget.

154
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:27,013
I'd never seen a gay man eat
a cinnamon roll like that.

155
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:31,117
Like they usually eat it like
I do, where you pick at it,

156
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,252
you know, like you would.

157
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,022
He ate it like this
guy right here.

158
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,557
(laughing)

159
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,991
Nothin'.

160
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:42,528
Anyway, he relents, gives
me his phone number.

161
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,263
We go on our first date
and I'll never forget,

162
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,200
all we talk about is
our dreams and you know,

163
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,836
all that kind of stuff you
talk about on first dates.

164
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:53,239
But, you know, this right
here is a combination

165
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,007
of all those dreams.

166
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,744
It's everything.
- I think it's perfect, Ted.

167
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,381
- Are you just saying that
to be a good intern, Sally?

168
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,716
- Absolutely not, no.

169
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,718
That's boardroom Sally's job.

170
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,086
To kiss your ass.

171
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,355
Mine, unfortunately,
is to run errands

172
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,257
and be generally
perceived as bitchy

173
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,426
because of my accent.

174
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,595
- That's definitely true.

175
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,766
- Does Barry have to
romance Sanders for me too?

176
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,168
- I just ruined
my cinnamon roll.

177
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,803
- There's the old man.

178
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,238
- I'm 30.

179
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,874
- Oh, I'm sorry, is middle-aged
more politically correct?

180
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,408
(tittering)

181
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,279
- I got your urgent calls and
your emergency text messages.

182
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,982
And I've been a little busy.

183
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,149
- Little busy?

184
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,253
Still cost you 10 cents
to receive a text?

185
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,388
- I don't have any change.

186
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,956
I'm not a peasant.

187
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,126
- Read my Tumblr today?

188
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,562
- I only read things
that interest me, Barry.

189
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,663
- How would you know
if it interests you

190
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,098
if you don't read it?

191
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,900
- Because you don't
interest us, Barry.

192
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,303
Therefore, we don't
read your propaganda.

193
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,272
- It got 5,000 shares.

194
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,172
- [Ted] What's that, Barry?

195
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,641
No one cares?

196
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:02,942
- 5,000 shares!

197
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,213
Sally, Sally, where you goin'?

198
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,448
(classical music)

199
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:13,452
- Okay everybody come on
in, take a seat please.

200
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,223
Take a seat.

201
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,497
Take a seat, take a
seat, take a seat.

202
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,698
Okay okay okay.

203
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,634
Cell phones away, Barry,
holster that please.

204
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,636
That includes Valley
of the Dolls, too,

205
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,205
just stick it somewhere.

206
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,106
So.

207
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,409
Barry.

208
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:40,313
I happen to think
that your Tumblr blog

209
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,581
was fire this morning.

210
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,050
- You hear that, Ted?

211
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,251
Fire.

212
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,954
- Fiona, did you just
say Barry's fired?

213
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,622
Oh, I hate to see you go, buddy.

214
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,391
- I used your bald spot to
do my hair this morning.

215
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,626
(laughing)

216
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,728
Isn't that right,
Boardroom Sally?

217
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,996
- Not my name,
that's not my name.

218
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,864
- It's not a bald spot, Barry,

219
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:02,301
this is where my huge
brain goes, okay?

220
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,538
Boardroom Sally, do
not listen to this man.

221
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,908
He's not a good
person, look at him.

222
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,309
Just look.

223
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,577
Good person?

224
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,779
Not a good person, no.

225
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,515
And learn the interns'
names, that's Tommy.

226
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,818
- It's Timmy, it's Timmy.

227
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:22,622
- I'm exhausted from
hearing your voices.

228
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,358
I literally am sitting here

229
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,160
and sleeping,
sleeping, sleeping.

230
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,430
Okay, so we have some good news,

231
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,665
we have some bad news.

232
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:36,369
The good news is, we
got the Cubs account!

233
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,536
The bad news:

234
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,840
we got the Cubs account.

235
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:41,774
Okay?

236
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,175
You are not ready for the Cubs.

237
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,411
You are not ready
for the Cubs, Ryan.

238
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,279
Because you are a child.

239
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,015
You are a teeny teeny tiny tiny

240
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,851
very cute little man baby.

241
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:52,852
Hmm?

242
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,755
People, this is my legacy.

243
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,590
Okay, this is my legacy.

244
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,291
You kill it with this account

245
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,828
and every business in
town will be calling you.

246
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:07,133
Einstein once said, "Try not
to become a man of success

247
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,802
"but rather try to become a man

248
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,271
"of value."

249
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,573
Isn't that nice?

250
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:19,378
I'm a woman, so I have no
problem becoming both, okay?

251
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,913
Now--
(knocking)

252
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,681
As you may have heard, I need
someone to lead us up on this.

253
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,451
I need someone to
oversee everything.

254
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,554
I need someone to make
sure we are hitting

255
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:32,324
everything from papers
to blogs to viral

256
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,495
and so with that, I am
very pleased to announce

257
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,331
that I am promoting Barry.

258
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,266
- Yes!
- Woo!

259
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,168
- [Fiona] To lead us up on this.

260
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,569
Nice job Barry.

261
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,437
- Barry?

262
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,337
- Okay.

263
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,610
Just say it Ted, what is it?

264
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,121
- Lagunitas.

265
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,122
You and me.
- Us?

266
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:03,956
- Sally.

267
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,091
- Yeah.

268
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,026
- Killed it for ya, okay?

269
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,428
Great account.
- Nice get.

270
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,629
- Lumomatti's.

271
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,264
- Oh, I love pizza.

272
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,934
- Another great account.

273
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:15,668
- How much pizza did we
eat for that account?

274
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:16,869
- Tons, tons.

275
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,370
- So much pizza we
ate for that account.

276
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,772
For you.
- I got lactose.

277
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,006
- For you!

278
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,308
We didn't want to
eat all that pizza,

279
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,876
we did it for you.

280
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,245
Under Armor.

281
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,646
- Don't even fit in the clothes.

282
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,048
- Doesn't even fit
in the clothes.

283
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,549
- [Jacob] Huge.

284
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,820
- That's how much we worked
on that account, for you.

285
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,489
I'm, just...

286
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,389
- I.

287
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,158
- Barry?

288
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,794
- Barry

289
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,530
has a huge internet following.

290
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,532
He and his little
pack of teen wolves,

291
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:50,002
they know viral videos
better than anybody.

292
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:54,406
- I don't understand what
Barry's huge following

293
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,641
has to do with

294
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,576
the Cubs.

295
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,511
- Nothin'.
- We got, the Cubs

296
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,545
has a huge following.

297
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,713
- Right.

298
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,481
- Because he's trusted,
people like him.

299
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,717
- No no, gay men like him,

300
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,587
because you post shirtless
selfies on Instagram.

301
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,022
- And assies.

302
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,023
- What, what,

303
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,224
what is an assie?

304
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,261
- Pictures of his ass.
(giggling)

305
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,264
- I knew that, I just
like to hear you say it.

306
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,798
- [Barry] I'm in my
underwear, in my defense.

307
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,667
- Oh, good for you!

308
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,270
(laughing)

309
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,171
Assies!

310
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:27,439
Sorry!

311
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,042
Listen.

312
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,744
- This is unbelievable.

313
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,146
I have been with you
since the beginning.

314
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,082
That's my promotion, Fiona,
I've been with you 10 years.

315
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:40,052
- Ted, life is about popularity.

316
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,122
Our smiles, they
brighten the world.

317
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,824
- Sure do.

318
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,826
Can you leave the room please
and let me speak with Ted?

319
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,727
Mmkay?

320
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,099
Okay please please
please move slowly

321
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,437
'cause it just gives
me the giggles.

322
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,241
Ted.

323
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,743
Look at this.

324
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,314
I built this.

325
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,883
I built all of
this 10 years ago.

326
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,853
And I am really, really
holding on, okay?

327
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:18,557
There was a time when one
person worked at this firm, me.

328
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,693
But PR is a young person's game,

329
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,795
and Barry gets that.

330
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,230
Okay?

331
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,532
Barry knows that our
demographic is constantly

332
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,200
on their phones and
they are texting.

333
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,537
And while they are texting
they are also on Twitter,

334
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,373
they are on Facebook,
they're on Instagram.

335
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,608
Okay?

336
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,811
Barry and his little
band of merry men,

337
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,646
they get that.

338
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,449
- Fiona, I've kept
up with that, I have.

339
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,717
I've kept up with it.

340
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,253
When I started with
you it was MySpace.

341
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,488
Then it was the
advent of Facebook,

342
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,723
I kept up with that.

343
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,259
And then don't even
forget when we started

344
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,594
we had a Geocities webpage.

345
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,098
- I thought that would last.

346
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,167
Listen.

347
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,737
I love you.

348
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,339
You're gonna work
with Barry on this

349
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,276
because I am asking you to,

350
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,143
okay?

351
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:18,384
- Chaining the Cubs account
to a child who posts assies?

352
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,152
(laughing)

353
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,987
- Sorry, just, sorry.

354
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,994
I just get a kick out of
this whole assie thing.

355
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,296
- It's asinine.

356
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,265
- Ted.

357
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,166
Hi.

358
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,504
Someday, you're gonna
run this company.

359
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,972
Not just an account.

360
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,709
You have to trust me on this,
I'm Fiona effing Sanders.

361
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,882
- Hey Kevin.

362
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,116
- Mm hmm?
- You know,

363
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,319
maybe you can come
over and help me out

364
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,655
with this piece of
crap that Dad bought

365
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,793
and he's probably
gonna blame me for.

366
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:05,130
- Talia, it took him a
month to build back home.

367
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,832
It took him a month
because I waited 29 days

368
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,467
to do it myself.

369
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,736
(laughing)

370
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,405
- Hey Kevin.
- Talia.

371
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,907
- Your dad is a hoarder.

372
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,408
(laughing)

373
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:20,312
- Yeah, that's from when he
started downloading porn.

374
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,213
- Ew.

375
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,183
- (laughing) Pogs.

376
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,418
Tamagotchi. (laughing)

377
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,654
Here's your pen recorder.

378
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:29,922
- My pen recorder?

379
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,457
- You used to torment
people with this.

380
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,761
- Oh, no no no no, put that
in my personal box, thank you.

381
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,196
I need that baby.

382
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:41,467
Oh my God, I finally
figured this thing out.

383
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,302
- Jack Gout speaking.

384
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:45,871
Hi, yes!

385
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,707
Ah, how are you?

386
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:50,976
What's new?

387
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,144
Yeah, tell me, fire away.

388
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,112
- Yes, yes.

389
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,482
Pro bono work, yes.

390
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,683
- Are you serious, Ted?

391
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,518
What about your
big promotion, huh?

392
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,753
You're rolling in the dough now.

393
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,055
You keep talking about
the Peruvian marble tops

394
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,992
in your dream home and
your bidet and, what?

395
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,560
- [Kevin] Shut up.

396
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:10,562
- Oh.

397
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:12,898
Oh.

398
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,167
Oh.

399
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,904
Oh, I am so, so sorry,
I didn't realize.

400
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:22,307
Maybe we can help you
look on Craigslist.

401
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:26,445
Your husband's really
good-looking, I don't know.

402
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,102
- Wait, lemme tell
you somethin'.

403
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,171
You wanna know who
is a real jagoff?

404
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,172
- Who?

405
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:53,972
- Truman.
- Truman?

406
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:54,807
- Oh, Truman.

407
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,475
He's a total jagoff.

408
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,444
Think about it, he
creates the CIA,

409
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,512
then he gets us
in the Korean War,

410
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,948
then NATO, that's got
Truman all over it.

411
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,950
And let's not forget
that the foreign policy

412
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,352
we are still living
with to this day.

413
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,287
- Yeah.
- Truman

414
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,189
is the W. Bush of his time.

415
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,826
- And to top all that he was
a St. Louis Cardinals fan!

416
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,260
- Jagoff!
- There's no bigger jagoff

417
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,195
in the world--
- Jagoff!

418
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,629
- than a St. Louis Cardinal fan!

419
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,530
- Jagoff!

420
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,900
Hey, think about this.

421
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,202
Sacagawea, her.

422
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,338
- [Stevie] (laughs) Thought
about a lot of things.

423
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,573
Yeah.

424
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,508
- Yeah, she's out there,
Lewis and Clark, her.

425
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,076
All that time.

426
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,645
I wonder which one of
those guys she boned.

427
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,315
What do you think,
Lewis or Clark?

428
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,685
Who would you bone
if you were her?

429
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,787
I bet she boned both of them.

430
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,222
- How'd we do on house, Dad?

431
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,357
- I told you I'd
unpack, didn't I?

432
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,827
All my cherished goods are
completely out of order.

433
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,629
What is that cabinet, I mean...

434
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,798
I've gotta fix that, okay?

435
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,700
Did it come like that?

436
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,938
- Uncle Stevie, can
I get you a beer?

437
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,740
- Old cheapo's gonna
buy me a drink.

438
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,208
Yes you can.

439
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,977
You know what though,
you are losin' somethin'.

440
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,245
It ain't your wallet,
it ain't your ring,

441
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,046
it's your hair, my
friend! (laughing)

442
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,581
- Waving goodbye,
it's waving goodbye.

443
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,417
- And by the way, Sacagawea,
she will bang both of them.

444
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,553
- Don't forget you said
you'd watch Liam tomorrow.

445
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,622
- Obviously we ran
out of options.

446
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,724
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (laughing)

447
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,960
Look how light he
is in those loafers.

448
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,363
- Barry, you came.

449
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,499
- Miss out on an event that
we're never gonna remember

450
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,968
for the rest of our lives?

451
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,970
- I've never heard of
somebody celebrating

452
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,238
three years before.

453
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,575
- Well, honey, when
your husband's a 10

454
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,377
and you're a schleppy

455
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:40,712
five,

456
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:41,880
uh, three, okay

457
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,783
every day you should celebrate.

458
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,585
- Sally, I expected you
to have better taste

459
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,688
than Simon and
Buttfunkle over here.

460
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,657
Barry, couldn't wear a tie?

461
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,959
Covers up your entire body?

462
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,128
(clears throat)

463
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,398
- Hi Ted.
- Hi Sally, how are you?

464
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,832
- I thought they
only had these things

465
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,734
at wakes and weddings.

466
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,572
Your pen is dead.

467
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,675
- Hold on, I might have one.

468
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,143
Here you go.

469
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,244
- What's this?

470
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,479
- Never seen one of these?

471
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,115
Barry is a tool.

472
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,086
Barry is a tool.

473
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,622
It's good, right?

474
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,556
- Oh.
- I know.

475
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,291
I thought you'd like that.

476
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,526
(cell phone buzzes)

477
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,663
I'm runnin' outta hands
here, I'm so popular.

478
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,166
Oh, I gotta go, I'll be back.

479
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:36,902
Barry.

480
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,540
- Get me a drink, Barry.

481
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,323
- The line's back there, pal.

482
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,791
- Who are you, the bouncer?

483
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,860
- Actually, I am, Barry.

484
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,374
(chattering)

485
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:41,099
(chatting and laughing)

486
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,510
- Happy third anniversary.

487
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:54,946
Just christened the
bathroom in the hot new bar.

488
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,215
- Because as your attorney,
these are the details

489
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,384
that I really wanna know.

490
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,355
- So, what's the
deal with that guy?

491
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,257
- That's George.

492
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,225
Jack's Facebook friend.

493
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:11,963
- Bro, your mom left you
for a dude on MySpace

494
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:17,302
and you are okay with your
wife having a Facebook friend?

495
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:22,274
- My husband, and they're
friends from high school.

496
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,509
- Whatever, you know
how I look at that.

497
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,345
Husband, wife, I don't
know who plays what.

498
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,848
But, I watch a lot
of daytime TV now,

499
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,417
and you are at least
two episodes away

500
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,821
from bein' cryin' on
a Dr. Phil episode.

501
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,658
- Where's Fiona?

502
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,060
- Yeah, I wasn't gonna tell you.

503
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,695
- What is so funny?

504
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,900
- I don't know.

505
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:49,968
- 100 likes.

506
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,672
- Oh my God, 57 retweets.

507
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,909
- Dude, your Instagram
is blowing up. (laughing)

508
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,279
- I don't know yet.

509
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,681
What's so funny?

510
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,785
(mumbling)

511
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:08,920
Okay.

512
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,055
- [Jack] Ted.

513
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,505
- Gettin' it on with the missus.

514
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:29,574
- So long Barry,
I'm taking a taxi.

515
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,811
- Sally, where are you going?

516
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:33,912
I hope you're not gonna
have a grudge with me

517
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,781
over this promotion.

518
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,849
- You got the promotion?

519
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,021
- I love you.

520
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:46,591
I didn't wanna ruin
our anniversary party.

521
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,861
I was gonna tell you
about the promotion.

522
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:53,532
- I'm gonna kick you
right in your mangina!

523
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:54,566
Come here!

524
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,468
- Damn, devil woman!

525
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:59,504
- Call me Lucifer,
honey! (laughing)

526
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,240
- Hey Ted, 5,000
views, congratulations.

527
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,242
You're now a statistic!

528
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:18,223
- Alright, phones,
everyone, phones!

529
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,124
Now.

530
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:21,827
Hello?

531
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,329
Yeah, hi, hi, yeah, Ted Gout.

532
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,166
Yeah, I could get you...

533
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,569
How's Carrie Wood work for
you on the 10 o'clock news?

534
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,938
Carrie Wood, 20 Ks.
(snapping)

535
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:33,872
20 Ks.

536
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,106
Why are you even calling me,

537
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,109
you don't know any of
the players' names?

538
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,511
Can I call you back?

539
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,412
Thank you.

540
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,649
Barry.

541
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,185
Ann Sathers

542
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,487
is my place of zen.

543
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,022
- I just came by to let you know

544
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,824
that I took down the video.

545
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,060
I got your husband's
legal threats.

546
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:58,230
Anyway, I'm super busy
today so I need you

547
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:01,933
and your team to formulate
campaign ideas, okay?

548
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,669
- Yeah, we're gonna have
a full day, you know,

549
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,606
get some mani pedis
(phone chimes)

550
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,609
and then we're gonna
get our hair done.

551
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,245
- Hey Ted, your phone's ringing.

552
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,713
- I hear it, guy.

553
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,415
- Oh, what's the matter, Teddy?

554
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,484
I thought you were
done with technology.

555
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,753
Oh, you can't live
without it? (scoffs)

556
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,021
Don't be an idiot.

557
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,656
- Idiot.
- Idiot.

558
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,291
- You know, listen.

559
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:30,528
I'm just blessed that this
stuff comes easy to me.

560
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,665
- Are you blessed, Barry?

561
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,133
Are you really blessed?

562
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,768
You're so blessed, Barry,

563
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:40,705
everything about your life
is friggin' blessed, great.

564
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:41,940
- Pretty much.

565
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:47,646
- Oh, by the way bro, I
ain't comin' in today.

566
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,948
- Ted, you can't do that.

567
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:52,083
- I can do whatever I
want, Barry, I'm Ted Gout.

568
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:52,984
- Ted!

569
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,789
- That was gay!

570
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,961
(soft music)

571
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,722
- Alright, tell me
more about that.

572
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:31,656
- No, I just go to
work and come home

573
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,924
and cook dinner for my husband

574
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,159
and then I'm like, that's it.

575
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,194
You're like living the
spiciest life right now.

576
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,595
- Well then we'll have to
go out, I'll take you out.

577
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:38,730
- Where, where are we going?

578
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,664
- I don't know.
- Oh my God,

579
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:40,699
I haven't been out in forever.

580
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,835
Tell me--
- Stop, you are boring--

581
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,470
- Why are you home?

582
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:51,309
- A very is sitting in
your office right now.

583
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,813
- Do you have to be home?

584
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:59,384
- Am I interrupting something?

585
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,785
- I don't know.

586
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:04,222
Jorge, is he
interrupting something?

587
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,658
- What?
- Play along.

588
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:07,892
- But I'm not--
- It's funny.

589
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,628
- Okay, fine.

590
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,664
This, no, you are not
because we are just friends.

591
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:13,832
- [Jack] Friends?

592
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,066
What do you mean?

593
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,201
You said we'd go back
to bedroom and take off

594
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,502
all our clothes!

595
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:20,105
- Oh, you're right, I forgot.

596
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,973
Shirt, shoes--

597
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,308
- [Both] Socks!

598
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,112
- We are leaving, Ted.

599
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:31,182
Please go to store and
pick up prescription.

600
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,083
Come on.

601
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,287
George, we go have sex now.

602
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,256
Bye bye.

603
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,161
- Wait, did you just say
you're going to your office

604
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,562
to have sex?

605
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,597
That's what you said?

606
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,498
- Yes.

607
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:49,501
Chill out.

608
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,003
Bae?
- Yes.

609
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,140
- You take me to my office now.

610
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,274
- Right away.

611
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,981
(murmuring)

612
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,884
- Wait wait wait wait, hey.

613
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:06,785
I'm bae!

614
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,220
I'm the bae!

615
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,121
I'm bae.

616
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,463
(instrumental music)

617
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,466
- What is that?

618
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,569
- Hungarian beef stick.

619
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:58,470
- I see.

620
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:00,472
I'm Norm.

621
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,875
- Norm, I'm Ted Gout.

622
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,376
What do you got there, Norm?

623
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,178
- Oh, this is a sundial.

624
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,079
- A sundial?

625
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,115
- Yes, to tell the time.

626
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,654
- I'm just making sure
you're not screwing with me.

627
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,289
Sundial to tell the time?

628
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:19,724
- Mm hmm.
- You don't use a watch?

629
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:20,625
- No.

630
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:24,696
I don't care much
for electronics.

631
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,899
- Not even a watch?

632
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,335
- No, no, and I don't have

633
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,937
video game systems, email.

634
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,006
- [Ted] Come again?

635
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,608
- I mean I don't
use the internet.

636
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,743
- At all?
- At all.

637
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:40,311
I have a landline.

638
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,348
- A landline?

639
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,983
They still make those?

640
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:45,884
- Yeah.

641
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:48,953
I mean they did an article
on me in Chicago Magazine.

642
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,588
- Really?
- Yeah, you didn't read it?

643
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,489
- No.
- No?

644
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,462
Basically I can get
any table I want

645
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:00,198
at a Chili's restaurant
if it's before 5:30.

646
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:01,633
- Huh.

647
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:04,068
Is it difficult to get a
table at Chili's before 5:30?

648
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,204
- Some people recognize me.

649
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,605
I've been recognized.

650
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,407
- What's not to recognize, Norm?

651
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,909
- Yeah.
- Wow.

652
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,578
- They got my good side.

653
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,013
- Mm hmm.

654
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,649
So Norm, what do
you do for a living

655
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,017
without these cell phones?

656
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,920
- I'm in investments, I invest.

657
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,388
- You're in investments?

658
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,324
That's great, but the market's
on the internet, isn't it?

659
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:30,562
- No no no, I invest in
businesses that I believe in.

660
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:34,199
Not at the market, land
of 1,000 douche bags.

661
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:35,934
The market.
- Market.

662
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:37,769
- Yeah.

663
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,038
- What's this number?

664
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:43,041
- That is the bedroom phone.

665
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,776
- The bedroom phone?

666
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:46,444
I love it.

667
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,417
(light music)

668
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,095
- Stop the presses!

669
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:28,653
- You're not gonna find what
you're lookin' for over here.

670
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:31,356
- What am I looking for?

671
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,491
(scoffs)

672
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,462
Hmm.

673
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,667
You're sick of technology.

674
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,637
You're tired of
the world wide web.

675
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,540
You're lookin' to
cut yourself off.

676
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,009
- How'd you know?

677
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,245
- Your face says I'm sick
of life, take me Lord.

678
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,314
- My, my face?
- Yes.

679
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:57,849
Your face.

680
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:00,151
Says come to me,
Jesus, and end it all.

681
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,686
- Oh, I don't know.

682
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,955
- You a rotary guy?

683
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,123
Or a wall jack?

684
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,190
- Excuse me?

685
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,597
- Now what you have here

686
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,968
is a rotary phone.

687
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,403
I don't suggest it
for someone who likes

688
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,238
to move around a lot.

689
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,639
Two-foot cord.

690
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,575
I mean, it could work for you.

691
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,577
What are you, about five two?

692
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,346
- I'm five seven.

693
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,715
- (laughing) Yeah, right.

694
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:33,851
And the fact that you have to

695
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:37,255
dial in a clockwise motion.
- Mm.

696
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,325
- This is for someone
who's more sitting,

697
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:43,828
who doesn't want to
move from their spot.

698
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,833
But this bad boy.

699
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,837
We jam this right into the wall.

700
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:58,309
You can move back and forth,
you can sit, you can lie down,

701
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:01,212
lotta options with
a phone like this.

702
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,948
I mean technically you
could with a rotary

703
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:06,284
but you'd have to
carry it around.

704
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,185
- Oh, God.

705
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,654
I don't know.

706
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:12,256
- What kind of work do you do?

707
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,124
You a salesman?

708
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,359
Retail?

709
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,993
- No, no, I'm a
PR representative.

710
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,062
- Oh, well, look at you!

711
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,565
You're probably too
fancy for one of these,

712
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:23,134
mister fancy pants big PR rep.

713
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,471
- No, no, no,

714
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,241
I'll take the wall
jack, the wall jack.

715
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,543
- Fine choice, fine choice.

716
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,313
- Alright, alright.

717
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,252
- The cord.

718
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,889
(laughing)

719
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,090
- You're a working man.

720
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,292
Look, I saw that
when you walked in.

721
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,560
I'll tell you what.

722
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:53,231
I am gonna throw in
a 15-foot long cord

723
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,032
just for you.

724
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,200
- Ooh.
- Also.

725
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:01,472
I'm gonna throw in a
few classics for you.

726
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:05,710
You're gonna have a phone
in every room in your house.

727
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,248
- I'm gonna take
it, let's do this.

728
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:11,616
How much?
- 150.

729
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,255
- 150 for a phone with a cord?

730
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,224
That seems a little steep.

731
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,692
- I thought you said he
was serious about phones.

732
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,727
- Dave.
- Don't waste my time.

733
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,628
- Dave.

734
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:24,529
Hold on.

735
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,932
Give it a shot.

736
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:30,668
- Alright, alright, yeah,
I'll take it, I'll take it,

737
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,103
I'll take it.

738
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,204
- You'll take it?
- Yeah, yeah.

739
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,872
- Did you not hear what I said?

740
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,575
I said I was gonna throw
in a few classics for you.

741
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,777
- Makes sense, that
150 makes sense now.

742
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,179
- I'll tell you what.

743
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,413
I'll throw in an
answering machine.

744
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,415
- Well now yeah, 150
of course, of course.

745
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,317
- The one with the
cassettes, right?

746
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,552
- Micro cassette.

747
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,054
- I'm gettin' a steal
then, it's a steal.

748
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:53,991
- I don't take credit
though, cash only.

749
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,259
ATM down the street.

750
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,727
- Yeah, we're gonna
have to go do that.

751
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,464
- We'll be back.
- Be right back.

752
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,601
(laughing)

753
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:06,571
- Sucker born every minute.

754
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,974
(classical piano music)

755
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:13,678
- Hey, put that down, I
wanna show you something.

756
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,513
- Not right now, okay.

757
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:18,983
One minute.
(laughing)

758
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,352
- Alright, with that
enthusiasm level, I mean

759
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,955
I could just not do
this, that's fine too.

760
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,490
Why am I even bothering?

761
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:26,891
Alright, alright,
alright, alright.

762
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:27,792
Ready?

763
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:36,234
A little something
for our love dungeon.

764
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,636
- The actually glory
of cell phones is that

765
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,438
we don't have to have this.

766
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,107
We have people to call us
on our cell phones, Ted.

767
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,376
Are you having like
a nervous breakdown?

768
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:46,310
- You're not getting it.

769
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,512
- Is this about that video?

770
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:48,479
- Okay, okay.
- He took it down,

771
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:49,747
you know that right?

772
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,016
It all went through,
I made that happen.

773
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,051
- I know, you make
everything happen, babes.

774
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,088
But you're not like, I'm
trying to cut us down

775
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,223
on technology and like...

776
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,994
Okay, okay, okay.

777
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,663
Remember when you
were in junior high

778
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:09,667
and you had some crush that
you were like really into

779
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,736
and you had one
of these bad boys.

780
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,071
And you would give him a buzz,
- Mm.

781
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,807
- and their mother would pick
up and you'd be real nervous

782
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,610
and you would talk about,
you know, to your crush

783
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,713
about whatever junior high
kids talk about, pizza, right?

784
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,783
But like, that was
living, that, oh,

785
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,287
was a good time.

786
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,988
- God, that was so fun.

787
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,156
I have a meeting in Chicago now,

788
00:36:32,189 --> 00:36:33,424
I'm gonna be so late.

789
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:34,692
Can we please talk
about this after?

790
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,594
- Wait wait wait wait wait.

791
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,196
Later today you have
a meeting in Chicago?

792
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,164
- Yes.
- No, no no no.

793
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,667
Kevin's bringing Liam over,
I've gotta watch Liam,

794
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,569
we're going to the park.

795
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:48,205
I need, right, but I need
someone here for the cable guy

796
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,876
when he comes over and
installs our phones.

797
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,881
- Okay, getting
legislation for women

798
00:36:56,914 --> 00:37:00,685
to get equal rights or
let the cable guy out.

799
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:02,987
Jeez Ted.

800
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,223
I don't know, what will I do?

801
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,592
- How about

802
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,560
maybe all the pro bono work

803
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:10,928
that you do all the time?

804
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,365
You know, don't forget,
I lost the promotion.

805
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,401
We don't got all that
kinda money comin' in.

806
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:20,037
I could use you to
help earn around here.

807
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,240
Like, all you're ever doin'
is helping other people.

808
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,709
Pro bono, pro bono.

809
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,445
Which is great, but like
give me a little attention,

810
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:30,681
give me a little love.
- Wonderful.

811
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,555
For years, Ted, you go
to school to learn law.

812
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,956
All sorts of law.

813
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:43,361
Entertainment law,
contract law, federal law,

814
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,428
law law law.

815
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,598
And then?

816
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,968
You actually get to practice it.

817
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:55,406
And for me, for people
who actually need it.

818
00:37:55,439 --> 00:38:00,077
So if you have a problem with
how much I'm getting paid,

819
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,612
then you don't understand
that I'm actually

820
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,915
helping people stand
up for themselves.

821
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,294
- Pick up the phone, come on.

822
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,898
Answer it for me, please.

823
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,438
(sighs)

824
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,375
- I was at work today.

825
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,710
- Yeah?

826
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,912
- Everyone saw this.

827
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:38,983
Every single person at my
office saw our sex tape.

828
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,752
Guys were comin' up to me,
high fivin' me left and right,

829
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:45,823
saying, "Good job for
being in a sex tape, man!"

830
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,094
Do you know what I didn't do?

831
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:54,865
Buy a phone with cords
on it and lose my mind.

832
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,501
How about that?

833
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,636
- Okay, okay.

834
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,638
Duly noted.

835
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,714
- Keep it together, sexy.

836
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,288
(light music)

837
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:27,164
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

838
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,167
Now I have to go
get ready, please.

839
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,510
- How you like the new shirt?

840
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:16,347
- I'd like it better
if it was buttoned up.

841
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,414
- I'm gettin' there.

842
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:18,649
- All the way.

843
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,186
(knocking)

844
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,756
- I think that's K.

845
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:30,227
K!
- Hey!

846
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,061
Ted.
- How's it going?

847
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,164
- [K] How you doin'?

848
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,666
- Alright K, Cousin
K, you know Larry.

849
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,134
Larry, Cousin K.

850
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,602
- How's it going, man?

851
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:39,770
- So.

852
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,840
- So show me where
your pilot takes place.

853
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,074
- Pilot, like?

854
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:48,245
- No, no no, K speaks in cable.

855
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,982
So you know, big TV fan.

856
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,552
Anyways, it's
where the setup is,

857
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:55,686
the setup's over here.

858
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:56,954
- Alright.
- Yeah.

859
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,723
Do you need Larry and
I here to like leave

860
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:00,558
for a little while?

861
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:01,625
We can go to Applebee's,

862
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:02,660
we can check out Friday's--

863
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:03,694
- No, you're all set.

864
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:04,962
You're good to go.

865
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,497
Here's the number
for your residence.

866
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,965
- That's it, huh?

867
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,635
Oh, what do you know?

868
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:12,536
Huh!

869
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,339
This is fun.

870
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:16,874
Am I wrong, am I wrong?

871
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,075
Alright, I'm not wrong.

872
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:19,310
Alright.

873
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:20,711
- Oh my God, I haven't
seen one of those.

874
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:21,545
- Huh?

875
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,947
Huh?

876
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,281
This has gotta be great for you.

877
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,618
- I love this, are

878
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,720
Yeah, push it, there

00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:32,490
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

880
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,724
Alright, okay.

881
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,827
How do we do this,
what do we say?

882
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,329
- Just wing it, just
wing it, just wing it.

883
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:39,296

884
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,465

885
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,602
Wanna get a good one

886
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:45,469
Alright.

887
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,439
Hi.

888
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:49,673
You've reached

889
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,077
Ted Gout and Jack Gout.

890
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,045
- And Cousin K.

891
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,715
- And luscious Larry Valentine.

892
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:00,651
What?

893
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:05,789
- Okay, anyways, you
can leave a message

894
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,091
after the beep.

895
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:10,728
Do I go beep?

896
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:11,862
- No, just hit stop.

897
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:14,131
- Okay, oh, yeah yeah yeah.

898
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,366
- Just right there.
- No the lid.

899
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,901
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

900
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,669
Alright, alright, alright.

901
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,603
- We're done, we're good.

902
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:20,404
- That was a good one, right?

903
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:21,639
- Yeah, record a message

904
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,174
on your 10th century
answering machine.

905
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,409
- Let's test all this out.

906
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:27,878
I'll call Norm, tell
him to come on by,

907
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,346
you guys can meet Norm.

908
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,481
- Who's Norm?

909
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:31,715
- The one that's
trying to live his life

910
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,318
like he trying to
piss off his daddy?

911
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,620
You have fun with that one.

912
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,424
- Haters gonna hate.

913
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,264
- Bro!

914
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:48,933
Yo!

915
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,302
I love the '90s!

916
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,206
Dope.

917
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,343
Walkman with the headphones.

918
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,912
- Oh, Walkman, absolutely man.

919
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,986
- Let us thank
the cannabis lord.

920
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,922
While we thanking
him, you do that.

921
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,926
Cords, I got all these cords.

922
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,129
You can tell this was the '90s.

923
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,531
- Best of New Edition.

924
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:21,865
I'll take that.

925
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,604
Ah man, now that's music.

926
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:29,173
(light music)

927
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,719
Someone will be over
between 10 and three today.

928
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:44,588
Didn't you get a call
about this yesterday?

929
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,056
- Hey.

930
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,658
It's three already.

931
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:48,792
- Don't worry about it, man.

932
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:50,761
We never actually come.

933
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,000
Whoa.

934
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,001
Dude.

935
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,635
What are you doin'?

936
00:43:58,669 --> 00:43:59,937
Ted, this guy's a narc!

937
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:00,771
- What?

938
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,605
Wha?
- You sent over

939
00:44:01,638 --> 00:44:03,407
a stool pigeon!
- No!

940
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,311
- What are you thinkin', man?

941
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:08,846
I'm supposed to be on the job.

942
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,581
(laughing)

943
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:13,350
It's not funny,
this is not funny.

944
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,419
- So you were high, huh?

945
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,523
Well this just keeps
gettin' better.

946
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:21,859
- You know the phone

947
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:23,427
was supposed to be

948
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,398
a means for people
to communicate.

949
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,167
Now it just seems like,

950
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:35,906
like it offers
1,000 different ways

951
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:39,410
for people to avoid
direct communication.

952
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,914
- Bro, who is this dude, really?

953
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:49,319
Look, I order pizzas
with my phone,

954
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,189
I open the garage with my phone,

955
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,558
I open car doors with my phone,

956
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:58,629
I order gifts with my
phone, I use Amazon, eBay,

957
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:03,233
Livin' Social,
Groupon, bootleg sites,

958
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:07,171
get Christmas gifts, I
watch porn on my phone,

959
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,074
from four different
sites, I have no viruses.

960
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,743
Do you see this
seven-inch screen?

961
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:17,448
If it had a mouth and long
hair that wasn't weave,

962
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:21,852
feet with no corns like she
really has a baby toenail,

963
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,622
she got an ample bottom
with no pimples on her booty

964
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:29,226
and beautiful breasts with
just the perfect nipples,

965
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:33,130
I would never need a person
in my life ever but my phone.

966
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,231
(knocking)

967
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:35,065
- Who's that?

968
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,366
- Kevin!

969
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,267
- Oh God!

970
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:49,313
One minute.

971
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,918
(jazz music)

972
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,220
Sorry.

973
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,889
Comin' through, comin' through.

974
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:01,325
Ooh!

975
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,140
(groaning)

976
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:20,377
(coughing)

977
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,849
- Hey bro, thank you for
watching little Liam today.

978
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:28,085
Ooh, is that an Uncle Sammy's?

979
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,686
Oh, double meat.

980
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,089
(sniffing)

981
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:35,926
Why's it smell like
Febreeze in here?

982
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,094
Goddamn, you.

983
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:38,796
Mm.

984
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,165
You're high.

985
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:42,666
Really?

986
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:47,171
- I'm not high, I'm like
medium, but it's all good,

987
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,206
it's all good, I'm like medium.

988
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,742
- Alright Liam, go sit on
the couch and do nothing

989
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,443
for two hours, nothing.

990
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,413
Jesus, just give him
a tablet or something.

991
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:57,247
- A tablet?

992
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:58,649
He's four.

993
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:00,150
- He's five.

994
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,885
Who has it?

995
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:02,853
- K, do it.

996
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,825
- My arch nemesis, cousin Kevin.

997
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:11,995
- Still a degenerate after
all these years, I see, eh K?

998
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:13,830
Later.

999
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,799
- Bye, sorry.

1000
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,068
Love ya.

1001
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:19,536
- Ted left.

1002
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,638
I can't run a campaign with
missing components here.

1003
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,573
- What is wrong with you?

1004
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,975
Who would post this video?

1005
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,510
Who would do that?

1006
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:27,444
- I,

1007
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:28,378
I thought I took it down.

1008
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,948
- I thought I took it down.

1009
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:31,949
Oh come on,

1010
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:34,251
you idiot!

1011
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:37,788
- Come on Fiona, it's funny.

1012
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:38,889
- Timmy!

1013
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:41,525
- Oh come on, Fiona, it's funny!

1014
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:42,726
- Get me Ted on
the phone, please.

1015
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:44,361
- Yes ma'am.

1016
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,496
- Hey, what about a show?

1017
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,967
- Check a newspaper
for the times.

1018
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,803
- I don't get a newspaper.

1019
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:54,905
- I'm gonna check for the times

1020
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:58,175
and if you rat me
out I will hurt you.

1021
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,944
- We'll call from the landline.

1022
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,179
- Holy crap.

1023
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,348
I haven't seen a Yellow
Pages in forever.

1024
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,416
- What we gonna do with
the miniature here?

1025
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,152
Like what do you do, little man?

1026
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:12,089
(whining)

1027
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:19,630
- We're going to the movies!

1028
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,633
(chatting and laughing)

1029
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:26,803
- [Man] Like you are, with
a boxing ring. (laughing)

1030
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,505
- Wait a second, this
is where we're going?

1031
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:29,539
I can't go in here.

1032
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,774
- Why can't you?

1033
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,042
I said we're going to
the Biograph, Biograph.

1034
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,243
- I didn't know it
was this Biograph.

1035
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:34,778
I am banned for life
from this place.

1036
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,013
- For what?

1037
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:38,282
- I was recording some
movies on my phone.

1038
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,716
- Pirating?

1039
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,951
That's stealing.

1040
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:42,619
- It was just for
my own personal use.

1041
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:44,554
I wasn't gonna sell it.

1042
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,722
I can't do it, guys.

1043
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,324
I'm out.

1044
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:48,859
- Where you going, where's he...

1045
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:50,861
- I don't know,
but I guarantee you

1046
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:52,129
he ain't getting there on time.

1047
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:53,930
Cable men never do.

1048
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:58,168
I've been waiting on my
cable man for three years.

1049
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:02,572
- Ted, it's Fiona.

1050
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,542
Listen, I want to
just let you know

1051
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:09,346
that the stakes, you
know, for this account,

1052
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:13,183
it's just my legacy,
your job, the business,

1053
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,052
you know, no biggie.

1054
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,887
- I got this.

1055
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,422
- Machine cut me off, get
him back, get him back.

1056
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:21,391
Would you just please shut
your mouth hole right now?

1057
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:24,461
Seriously, sit down,
just sit there!

1058
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:29,333
Did I take my vitamin C today

1059
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,867
or did I not take my vitamin C?

1060
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:32,102
Timmy?

1061
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,337
- [Timmy] I think
you did, yes ma'am.

1062
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,371
- Do you have Ted back?

1063
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:36,006
- [Timmy] No ma'am.

1064
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:39,643
- Can anybody do anything

1065
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:42,813
or am I runnin' the show myself?

1066
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:44,881
- So, bite to eat?

1067
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,283
- Where you wanna go?

1068
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,617
Hot dogs, hamburgers,
hamburgers?

1069
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,518
- Burgers.

1070
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,157
- Can I just say
that was sublime?

1071
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,792
- Oh dude.

1072
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,060
I never thought I'd say this,

1073
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,895
but that Chris Pratt
is a handsome fella.

1074
00:49:58,929 --> 00:49:59,997
Better than the
stuff he was doing

1075
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,765
pattin' the dinosaurs
on the head.

1076
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:05,268
And that Jessica Chastain,
she was a rock (mumbles).

1077
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:07,971
- By the way, if I can see
every Nancy Meyers movie high,

1078
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:09,840
I'd be in heaven.

1079
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:12,843
Oh, I don't think it was
Jessica Chastain, though.

1080
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:16,113
I think it was
Bryce Dallas Howard.

1081
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,315
Or was it Eddie Redmayne?

1082
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,717
I don't know, they
all look alike to me.

1083
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:22,519
- I was just thinking.

1084
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:24,254
Kevin still has K's weed.

1085
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,590
And he's gonna be missing that.

1086
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:27,824
- Kevin.

1087
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:28,725
Yeah, we'll get it back
from him when he comes

1088
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:30,127
to pick up Liam.

1089
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,330
- [All] Liam!

1090
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:37,167
(dramatic music)

1091
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:41,071
(orchestral music)

1092
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,285
- Oh God, okay, okay.

1093
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,320
Oh, why's she gotta make
two-hour-long movies?

1094
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,755
I hate Nancy Meyers.

1095
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,524
- Why do the previews
have to be 20 minutes?

1096
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,725
- Okay look.

1097
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,927
Just let me call Kevin,
it's an emergency,

1098
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,095
I'll use my phone.

1099
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:07,964
- No, Kevin's
number's in my phone.

1100
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:11,635
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

1101
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,544
- [Jack] Whoa, whoa whoa
whoa, what's the rush?

1102
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,279
Where are you going?

1103
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,248
- Nope.

1104
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,420
- Oh, my God!

1105
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:31,521
- What are you doin'?

1106
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:32,756
What are you doin'?

1107
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,324
Stop.

1108
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:37,127
Another step and you're dead.

1109
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,563
Alright, hang out
here buddy, okay?

1110
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,466
Play with your Tamagotchi.

1111
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,534
Okay, alright, good boy.

1112
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:49,739
- Whoa, Kevin, relax,
relax, back off man!

1113
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,640
Whoa.

1114
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:52,709
- Dude.

1115
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:55,345
- What the hell is goin' on?

1116
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:56,780
- Why don't you ask
mister mid-life crisis

1117
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,281
what's going on here?

1118
00:51:58,315 --> 00:51:59,549
Him and his friends got high

1119
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:02,352
and left my kid in
your apartment all day!

1120
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:04,020
- You idiot.

1121
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:05,755
- Come on.
- You moron!

1122
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,124
You have a child
and you get high?

1123
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:08,258
What the heck is wrong with you?

1124
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,159
- Jeez!

1125
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:11,728
- How do you think it feels
when your kid calls you

1126
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:14,664
and tells you he's been
alone for two hours?

1127
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:15,599
- He called you?

1128
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,733
- Thank heavens!

1129
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:18,301
- Wait, he has a phone?

1130
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:19,202
He's five.

1131
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,339
Who's he callin', his mistress?

1132
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:24,641
- His father when his
uncle neglects him!

1133
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:26,476
- Fine, look at him,
he's right over here,

1134
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,711
it's all good.

1135
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:30,413
He's all good, come here buddy.

1136
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,449
Oh, yeah, he's fine, he's got,

1137
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,917
Well, he may be a little
high, I don't know,

1138
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,318
he's got one shoe off.

1139
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,521
- A little high, that's--
- That was a joke!

1140
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:38,355
- that's great.

1141
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:39,890
- It was a joke!

1142
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:43,493
- Did you get into the booze,
did you get into the pop, huh?

1143
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:44,694
Huh, are you okay?

1144
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,296
- He's fine, you left
him with four guys

1145
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:50,000
watchin' stoner flicks,
what do you expect?

1146
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:52,536
- Say goodbye to Uncle.
- Bye Uncle.

1147
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,104
- Bye guy, see ya.

1148
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:56,473
Bye Liam.

1149
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:00,677
- Okay, the child.

1150
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,980
You put the child in danger.

1151
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:04,881
- Mmm...

1152
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:11,187
I wouldn't say, neglect that's
such a dirty, filthy word.

1153
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,756
I would say, uh...

1154
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,660
Oh, I didn't tell you
the part of the story

1155
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,396
where my husband was
home the entire time

1156
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:21,298
and they were playin'.

1157
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,801
(laughing) You know.

1158
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:28,338
- What the hell has
gotten into you?

1159
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,741
(groaning and laughing)

1160
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:35,946
Damn.

1161
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:37,747
- You do look good.

1162
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:38,648
- So good.

1163
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:42,285
Hey, I don't need you
to tell me that, okay?

1164
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,788
Tell me I look smart.

1165
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:47,490
(groaning)

1166
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:51,461
- You know, I shouldn't even
be watching kids anyways.

1167
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:54,898
Remember what I told you when
you said you wanted a dog?

1168
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:55,799
- Yes.

1169
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:01,204
You said we don't
need to buy anything

1170
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,039
that needs to be fed.

1171
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:04,908
Swoon.

1172
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,713
- What do you want
for dinner, Chinese?

1173
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,715
(sighs)

1174
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:14,250
I'm still hungry.

1175
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:17,153
- Ted, no, I'm not hungry.

1176
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,788
You smoked!

1177
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:19,756
Without me!

1178
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:24,027
Like, that's our thing, right?

1179
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,962
Like I come home and
you have it ready for me

1180
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:27,998
and we have a cute little
moment and we like connect

1181
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:30,100
after a long day.

1182
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:32,102
And you endangered our nephew

1183
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:34,871
and you don't even seem to care!

1184
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:38,508
And you smoked without me
man, like what's up with that?

1185
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:41,978
- So that's a soft
yes on Chinese, right?

1186
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:45,415
(groans)

1187
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:50,253
- I like the stars.

1188
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,022
What do the stars
look like to you?

1189
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:55,091
- Okay right over
here I see titties.

1190
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,059
- I do too.

1191
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:58,061
Those are Madonna's titties.

1192
00:54:58,094 --> 00:54:59,029
- Oh, damn.

1193
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,032
- And over here,
Sharon Stone's titties.

1194
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,266
- Oh!
- And oh, (laughing)

1195
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:04,434
they're touching each other.

1196
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,535
- Wow.

1197
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,037
Oh damn!

1198
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,672
Oh, she's got like
a third nipple.

1199
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:09,606
- Yeah.

1200
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,107
You know they're older than us.

1201
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,710
Madonna and Sharon Stone
are older than me and you.

1202
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:14,878
- Really?
- And they look pretty good.

1203
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,379
- Oh my God, they look amazing.

1204
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:19,215
- They don't look as good as
we do, but they look good,

1205
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,483
you know?

1206
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:21,618
- They don't look
as good as we do.

1207
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,586
- No.
(laughing)

1208
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,022
- I'm thinking about gettin'
back into wrestling shape.

1209
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:26,856
- Seriously?
- You know,

1210
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:27,857
I'm thinking about,

1211
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:29,125
you know.
- Oh, wow.

1212
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,028
- I was a prime, you
know, third in state

1213
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,564
in high school.
- You were good.

1214
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:37,267
I will tell you
this, you were good,

1215
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,869
but I could always
put you in the half

1216
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,604
and get you down for
the count., because

1217
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:44,607
no matter what you could
not get out of the Windsor.

1218
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:46,242
- What are you talking about?

1219
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:47,410
- Oh come on.
- Crazy.

1220
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:49,045
- You know what,
I'll do it right now.

1221
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,380
I will do it, come on.

1222
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:51,581
- I don't even think
you can sit up.

1223
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,283
- I will do it right now.

1224
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:54,918
- I'll give you $100
if you can sit up.

1225
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:55,985
- Oh go to hell.

1226
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,021
- Oh you're crazy.

1227
00:55:58,054 --> 00:55:59,456
You're crazy.

1228
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:02,225
- Let me tell you somethin',
now this is the truth.

1229
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:06,096
Nobody, nobody threw
a curve ball like you

1230
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:09,699
and that is something I
tell your son all the time.

1231
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,534
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1232
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:12,769
- Well, you know what?

1233
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,605
You had a very,
very good hook too.

1234
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:17,640
- Well yes, I could always
strike you out with it,

1235
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:18,575
that is true.

1236
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:21,211
- Well that is something.

1237
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,379
We did have some fun.

1238
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:26,483
Remember workin' on
cars in the garage?

1239
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:27,417
We did that.

1240
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:28,651
- Oh, that was awesome, yes.

1241
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:29,919
- Or the bunk beds
we had upstairs

1242
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,721
and we'd pee out the window.

1243
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:33,089
- Oh, that's right, oh!

1244
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,557
Dad got so pissed!

1245
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:35,358
- 'Cause he had to repaint
the side of the house

1246
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,326
with the yellow streak!

1247
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:37,927
- That streak goin' right down.

1248
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:41,231
- Then we'd sneak out
there to go see girls.

1249
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:42,565
- Oh man.
- Do all that?

1250
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,067
- And then we'd get
caught and he would

1251
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,468
kick the shit out of us.

1252
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:46,503
- He'd kick the shit out of us

1253
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:47,403
whether we got caught or not.

1254
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:48,705
- Yeah. (laughing)

1255
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,073
Yeah, he was kinda angry.

1256
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:51,141
- Yeah, he was very angry.

1257
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:53,810
- He was very angry.
- Yeah.

1258
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:55,044
We lifted weights in the garage,

1259
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,312
that's probably why we
lifted so much weights.

1260
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:57,213
- Yes!

1261
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,448
- We were getting ready.

1262
00:56:58,481 --> 00:56:59,883
For the day when
we'd take him on.

1263
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,718
- As protection.
- Yeah.

1264
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,486
- Yeah, bastard died too soon.

1265
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,188
- [Chuck] Yeah, I
was ready though,

1266
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:06,389
I always had your back.

1267
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,624
- You did.
- Yeah.

1268
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:10,760
- You always did.
- Yeah, I was ready.

1269
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,296
(light music)

1270
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:15,432
You know what, I think
we should hit the jazz.

1271
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:16,833
Coltrane, Miles Davis.

1272
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:19,068
- Wait no no no,
Kennedy's totally doowop.

1273
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,303
Yeah, it's more complete.

1274
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:22,138
It's like go up the
hill in the Caddy

1275
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,506
and you got your chill music.

1276
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,841
- Are you crazy?

1277
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,977
So Kennedy is
chillin' with chicks

1278
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:29,846
listening to Deon
and the Belmonts?

1279
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,447
- Hell yes he was.

1280
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:32,682
- You're crazy.

1281
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:33,917
But what do I know?

1282
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,452
I was getting laid to
Springsteen every night.

1283
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:38,454
- Oh please, who let you
bang them to the Boss?

1284
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:40,523
- Oh a lot of people.

1285
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:42,425
Sophia Smothers.

1286
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,860
- Oh no, no no no.

1287
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:46,296
Stanky McJanky
Smothers? (laughing)

1288
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,130
No!

1289
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:48,598
Stanky, woo!

1290
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:49,866
Whoa!

1291
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:51,568
- And Jenna Jockey.

1292
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:52,769
(laughing)
Yeah.

1293
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,571
- Jenna Jawbone?
- Yeah.

1294
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:56,039
- Let me tell you somethin'.

1295
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:58,341
I ran into her, I don't
know, about three weeks ago.

1296
00:57:58,374 --> 00:57:59,676
- Yeah, how'd she look?

1297
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:00,610
- Like us.

1298
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,811
- Oh my God, that's horrible.

1299
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,279
- It was heartbreaking.
- That's disgusting.

1300
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:06,583
- You're reminiscing skanks
girlfriends past again?

1301
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:08,685
- You left my nephew alone?

1302
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:09,986
- My grandson?

1303
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:11,221
- Yes, your grandson.

1304
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:14,057
- I would yell but
I'm very hungry.

1305
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:23,499
- Oh, thanks for
savin' me some joe.

1306
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:27,470
This'll keep me up for
another two minutes.

1307
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:30,206
- It does stunt your growth.

1308
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,210
(groaning)
- Somethin' stunted it.

1309
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:35,411
- I better go get dressed,

1310
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:36,646
gotta get ready for work.

1311
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,481
- Let me guess,
he kicked you out.

1312
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:40,583
- [Ted] I left
under my own accord.

1313
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:42,552
- Yeah.
- Oh did you?

1314
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:43,887
Okay, okay.

1315
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,023
- Listen to me Teddy, go
home, don't be a dummy.

1316
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:48,324
Okay how about this?

1317
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,792
What about Brenda?

1318
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,060
Brenda was hot.
- Brenda was dirty.

1319
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:52,328
I liked that about her.

1320
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,331
She was dirty, she was
a pirate and a hooker.

1321
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,866
- (laughing) Dirty
pirate hooker!

1322
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,768
- And she had the, it was
funny because she had the,

1323
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,270
she was missing a hand.

1324
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,238
And it was back when you could
make fun of people for that.

1325
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:03,506
- Exactly.
- She had the hook, ow.

1326
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,041
(imitates Brenda)
- Yeah yeah yeah.

1327
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,709
- And sometimes she'd
put the hook up my ass.

1328
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:08,011
- Yeah, well she put
it up everybody's ass!

1329
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,012
- She nailed that prostate.

1330
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,714
- You'd get yelling--
- Wow!

1331
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:14,617
(light music)

1332
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:15,818
- Mr. Sandberg, Ryne.

1333
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,854
I like to look at the
Cubs as right here

1334
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,223
but me and you together,

1335
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:21,758
we could put 'em up here.

1336
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:24,994
We can put them right there,
big guy, yeah, there we go.

1337
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:26,062
There we go.

1338
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:27,764
Yes!

1339
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,701
- Remember, this place
is nothin' without you.

1340
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,103
Ted, you helped
build this place.

1341
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:37,373
They have this account
because of you, okay?

1342
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,608
- Yeah.
- You got this?

1343
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:39,842
- I got it.
- You ready?

1344
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:41,244
- We got it, I'm goin' in.

1345
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,145
- Okay.

1346
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:44,447
- Ted.

1347
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:46,983
I need a coffee.

1348
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:48,685
Think you could grab me one?

1349
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:52,755
Or maybe a croissant? (laughing)

1350
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,223
- Carbs?

1351
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,060
- There are carbs
in a croissant?

1352
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:00,830
- Bryce, other Bryce,
how are you today?

1353
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:03,766
- Um, neither of us are Bryce.

1354
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,803
- Yeah, well nevertheless,
Bryce, Bryce,

1355
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:09,539
we'll see you upstairs, goodbye.

1356
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,342
Oh hey listen, listen.

1357
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,111
Just practice what
you preach, Ted.

1358
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:17,814
Let Fiona know how
you feel, okay?

1359
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,049
Mission, truth-telling.

1360
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:23,319
Just walk up there
and lay it out.

1361
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:24,554
Alright?

1362
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:27,156
Come on, you got
this, let's do it.

1363
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,828
- Hi, I've been calling
you all weekend, Ted.

1364
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,330
- There is no Ted, only Zuul.

1365
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:37,233
- What, do you not answer
your cell phone anymore?

1366
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:39,669
- Oh, I'm getting out of the
whole cell phone racket, Fiona.

1367
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:40,937
- What does that mean?

1368
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,839
- That means that
I see the future.

1369
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:44,907
- Okay, just tell me,
is this a Barry thing?

1370
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:48,878
- No no no no, Barry's
your screw-up, not mine.

1371
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:51,514
- Okay, so,

1372
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:55,752
now that we're all here.

1373
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:57,887
- You know what?

1374
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,823
It's so funny,
coming to work today.

1375
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,091
All the technology.

1376
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:05,261
Everyone's always
on their phones.

1377
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:07,497
Kids with their heads
buried in their phones

1378
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:11,968
all the time, walkin' and
textin', drivin' and textin'.

1379
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,302
Everybody on their phones.

1380
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,505
Look at Google for
brains over here.

1381
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:16,973
- Yeah.

1382
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:17,807
- Oh Barry.

1383
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,743
(overlapping voices)

1384
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:24,013
Remember the movie
2001: A Space Odyssey?

1385
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:26,682
It's a classic, it's a classic.

1386
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:29,685
Hal, you know how Hal
turns on all of us, Barry?

1387
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:30,520
You know that?

1388
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:31,454
Do you know about that?

1389
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:32,989
You probably wouldn't, Barry.

1390
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,058
Because Barry, you should
see 2001: A Space Odyssey.

1391
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:37,693
It was made in
1968, it's in color.

1392
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:39,228
It's a good movie.

1393
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:42,632
You know-nothing pre-2000
waste of human skin.

1394
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:46,803
- Okay, are we done with
the film reviews now?

1395
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:48,604
I'm gonna say this once,

1396
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:49,839
and then we're gonna
start this meeting

1397
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,340
and you're gonna
get back to work

1398
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:55,011
if you want to continue
to have a job here, okay?

1399
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:59,449
The more connected you
are, the more opportunities

1400
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:01,818
that you have and the more
opportunities you have,

1401
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:04,220
the more money you can make.

1402
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:08,758
If you can be on top of
whatever product is hot

1403
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,727
at that moment, you can be king.

1404
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:12,628
Got it?

1405
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:15,331
We have Jacob and...

1406
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:18,801
- If someone doesn't
put their foot down

1407
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:21,771
and lead the way, we
are gonna go down a road

1408
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:24,540
with these tech companies
that we cannot recover from!

1409
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,944
- (laughing) Okay, Ted.

1410
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:32,281
I apologize for the way
that we're starting off.

1411
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:34,417
Jacob, could you please--
- Absolutely.

1412
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,251
- give us a big push there?

1413
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:36,486
Thank you my dear.

1414
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:39,622
- It's your fiction
that interests me.

1415
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,059
Your studies of interplay

1416
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:46,896
and the human
motive and emotion.

1417
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,364
Isaac Asimov.

1418
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:50,166
- You're fired.

1419
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:51,400
Fiona Sanders.

1420
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:55,171
I cannot have a breakdown today.

1421
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:56,372
I cannot have it.

1422
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,274
You have got one of the
biggest players here

1423
01:02:58,307 --> 01:03:02,512
in Chicago effing history
and you are making a scene.

1424
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,618
- You can't fire me.

1425
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:12,088
Just because I don't
want to be some droid,

1426
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,656
void of life?

1427
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:15,191
You can't fire me.

1428
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:17,093
Because I, 'cause I
want to live naturally?

1429
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,094
- Just did.

1430
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,766
So sorry.

1431
01:03:23,799 --> 01:03:24,667
We are...

1432
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:28,171
are going to hear these pitches

1433
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:31,507
which I have a very
good feeling about.

1434
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,280
(somber music)

1435
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,595
- You!

1436
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:53,896
I remember you!

1437
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:58,768
You're the guy that almost
hit me with the truck.

1438
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:01,003
I remember you, with the phone!

1439
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:02,638
- What, this phone?

1440
01:04:06,842 --> 01:04:08,544
See you later buddy!

1441
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:14,283
- I'm back.

1442
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:15,818
You know, I was just
thinking about something.

1443
01:04:15,851 --> 01:04:20,289
If you wouldn't mind giving
me one second of your time.

1444
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:21,524
Hey girl, hey.

1445
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:25,928
I was thinking
about simple times

1446
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:27,363
and how much I miss 'em.

1447
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:28,865
- Oh.

1448
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:30,099
- [Ted] That's what I was
thinking about right there.

1449
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:32,802
- You have lost
your goddamn mind.

1450
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:36,405
- Hi Barry, yep, this thing's
attached to your ear, Barry.

1451
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,140
Simple times, buddy.

1452
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:40,476
That's what I'm thinking about.

1453
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:41,544
What do you got there, Barry?

1454
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,012
Don't be scared.

1455
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,448
What do you got there, Barry?

1456
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:48,251
500 people in this
building, Barry,

1457
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:51,921
and you can't ask one of
them to take your picture?

1458
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,155
Really?

1459
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:56,325
Is that how antisocial
you've gotten?

1460
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,694
You know Barry,

1461
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,297
you don't understand the
power that's in your hands.

1462
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,232
You're so entitled.

1463
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:06,402
I hate your stinking,
breathing guts.

1464
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,541
(clapping)

1465
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,745
- I'm so sorry.

1466
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:18,848
- He's short, but we could
use him on the bench.

1467
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:21,817
(orchestral music)

1468
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:51,614
- Hey.
- Hi.

1469
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,683
Thanks for comin'.

1470
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:57,019
- I'm sorry if I'm
working too much.

1471
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:58,621
- No, you're fine.

1472
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:00,856
You're helpin' out other people

1473
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,125
I love that about you.

1474
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:03,993
- [Jack] Thanks.

1475
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:05,561
- It's just, you know.

1476
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:08,597
I get a little
jealous sometimes.

1477
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,099
- Why are you jealous?

1478
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,233
- 'Cause sometimes
I want to have you

1479
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:12,468
all to myself.

1480
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:15,538
- Aw.

1481
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:16,939
That's sweet.

1482
01:06:16,972 --> 01:06:18,074
I made dinner.

1483
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:19,709
- Oh did you?
- Mm hmm.

1484
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:21,043
- [Ted] Yeah?

1485
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:22,912
- Couldn't get a
reservation at Olive Garden.

1486
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:25,314
- Who deals with a
hostess at Olive Garden?

1487
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:27,183
- [Jack] Me, Jack Gout.

1488
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:29,518
(laughing)

1489
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:49,038
(groaning and laughing)

1490
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:55,144
- You there, you awake?
- Mm hmm.

1491
01:06:57,613 --> 01:06:58,981
- Quit your job.

1492
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:01,717
- What?

1493
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,920
- Yeah, let's do what we
said what we were gonna do

1494
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:08,324
when we retire now,
let's quit our jobs.

1495
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,763
- I'm not quitting my job.

1496
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:14,663
- Oh.

1497
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:16,932
I quit mine.

1498
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:22,071
- You quit your job?

1499
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:25,174
- Well I mean
technically I got fired.

1500
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:26,275
- Ted!

1501
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:27,877
- What?

1502
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:30,813
Like come on, we said
we were gonna get an RV

1503
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,649
and travel and, you know,

1504
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:36,986
eat out of woks and
read trashy novels.

1505
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:46,195
- Ted.

1506
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:52,034
I don't know how to
react to you this week.

1507
01:07:52,067 --> 01:07:54,904
We can't just quit our jobs.

1508
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:57,239
We don't have that
kind of nest egg.

1509
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:59,675
We can't just quit working.

1510
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,310
- Sure we can.

1511
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,378
- No.

1512
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,513
Like literally we cannot.

1513
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,787
Would you consider seeing
a doctor or something?

1514
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:15,357
Your weather and traffic
is way off, babe.

1515
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:19,595
- A doctor?

1516
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:23,065
'Cause I'm crazy?

1517
01:08:23,098 --> 01:08:25,301
'Cause my ideas are crazy?

1518
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,337
'Cause the rest of the
world's doing one thing

1519
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,439
and I'm doing somethin' else?

1520
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:32,341
Is that why I'm crazy?

1521
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,145
Did you ever think about maybe

1522
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:41,383
the rest of the world's
crazy and I'm the normal one?

1523
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,052
But you know what?

1524
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:44,553
(laughing)

1525
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:46,822
I'm gonna write a book.

1526
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:48,290
I'm gonna travel.

1527
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,361
I'm gonna do it all
without technology.

1528
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:53,963
And you know why?

1529
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:56,332
Because I'm Ted Gout.

1530
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:58,000
And if you don't like it,

1531
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:02,238
it's probably because I'm
not like Barry or George.

1532
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:04,206
- George?

1533
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:06,909
George?

1534
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:11,814
That is what this is
all about? (scoffs)

1535
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:14,817
What is your
obsession with George?

1536
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:29,832
Why am I always
chasin' after you?

1537
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:50,352
(soft music)

1538
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,870
(honking)

1539
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:12,341
(orchestral music)

1540
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,242
- Larry!

1541
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:20,249
(grunting)

1542
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:24,687
Or the trunk, whatever.

1543
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,522
- Whatever, whatever.

1544
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:28,591
Man.

1545
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:30,059
I needed this.

1546
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:32,361
I needed a break from
tossing out bearded drunks

1547
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:35,297
with skinny jeans,
I needed this.

1548
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:36,966
We goin' campin'!

1549
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:40,769
We goin' campin'! (laughing)

1550
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:54,950
- Ted.

1551
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,119
Look what I got.

1552
01:10:57,152 --> 01:10:58,621
- [Ted] You got cassettes.

1553
01:10:58,654 --> 01:11:02,591
- [Norm] Yeah, what do you
think I got in here, clothes?

1554
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:05,661
(jazzy piano music)

1555
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:27,983
(growling)

1556
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:29,785
- Alright, Wisconsin.

1557
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:44,400
Beautiful summer day or what?

1558
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:45,300
Gorgeous!

1559
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:50,005
(soft harmonica music)

1560
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,065
Larry!

1561
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:16,965
- Ted!

1562
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:22,071
- I thought you were in
charge of the cooler.

1563
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:23,105
- Yeah.

1564
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:25,107
I brought a cooler.

1565
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:29,078
- There's no ice, there's
no brews, it's empty.

1566
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:33,315
- Yeah, I brought a
cooler for campin'.

1567
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:40,489
- How much cash you got on you?

1568
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,591
- I got a couple of bucks.

1569
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:43,792
- Norm?

1570
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:45,394
- Nothin'.

1571
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,029
- No credit?

1572
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:48,931
- I don't have credit.

1573
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:52,267
- You're an investor, Norm.

1574
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:53,769
You don't have credit?

1575
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,904
- Um, not when they all go under

1576
01:12:55,938 --> 01:13:00,409
and you have to declare
bankruptcy. (chuckling)

1577
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:02,745
(light music)

1578
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:03,645
- Oh no.

1579
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:06,315
You told me

1580
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:10,519
to cut the technology,
to cut the cord.

1581
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:13,188
You told me I didn't need it.

1582
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:16,658
That you're an investor,
you invest money, Norm.

1583
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:17,760
You didn't need it.

1584
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:19,828
- Yes, after my surgery,

1585
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,431
I dropped technology

1586
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:25,167
and I became an investor.

1587
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,736
Those investments, you
ever hear of penny stocks?

1588
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:28,871
- Oh God.

1589
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:30,739
- Well I mean technically--

1590
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:32,307
- Larry, butt out!

1591
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:36,078
Wait, what surgery?

1592
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:40,682
- I used to get
epileptic seizures, yeah.

1593
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:44,019
They took part of my
brain out. (clicks)

1594
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:45,521
Now I'm all good.

1595
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,628
- No.

1596
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:59,301
All the big talks,

1597
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,906
all the life-changing
affirmations,

1598
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,942
even you

1599
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,944
got a cell phone, Norm?

1600
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,650
- It's for emergencies, Ted.

1601
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:18,153
I never use it.

1602
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:19,321
- You got it!

1603
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:25,027
God you're stupid, Norm.

1604
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:30,432
- I'm not stupid.

1605
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:35,204
My mom makes me carry it.

1606
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:41,143
- That's a little
over the line, Ted.

1607
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:42,811
So what?

1608
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:44,112
He has a phone?

1609
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:49,585
These Walkmans, compasses,
this SUV, even your landline

1610
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:53,188
were all new technology
at some point.

1611
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:56,158
I mean, snap out
of it, look at you.

1612
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:59,261
You were about to kill
Norm and for what?

1613
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:01,663
A cell phone he rarely uses?

1614
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,634
This was fun for a while, Ted.

1615
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,503
A few days to be exact.

1616
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:09,638
But come back to reality.

1617
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:14,843
You alright?

1618
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:16,445
Cool.

1619
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:19,081
(bright music)

1620
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:22,484
- Hey brother.

1621
01:15:22,517 --> 01:15:24,419
It's cool, we got plenty.

1622
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:25,888
- Your wife growled at me.

1623
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,256
- Yeah, that's how
she says hello.

1624
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:29,091
Come chill for a bit.

1625
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,764
- So, how you feel about
having a black dude

1626
01:15:35,797 --> 01:15:37,266
at your campsite?

1627
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:39,635
- It's cool Larry, just keep
smilin' so we can see you.

1628
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:41,436
(chuckling)

1629
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:43,105
- We gonna keep
prayin' for that chair.

1630
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:44,907
Alright.
(chuckling)

1631
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,141
- Lighten up, will ya?

1632
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:48,610
Look around you, we're
all having a great time.

1633
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:50,078
- That's my girl.

1634
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:52,514
Isn't she the best?

1635
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:56,318
So what's the story, you
guys married or what?

1636
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:59,721
- Oh no, not for me,
no, absolutely not.

1637
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:01,456
- No.

1638
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,326
- What about you, Teddy?

1639
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:07,496
- Yeah, I'm married.

1640
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:08,764
- Where's your wife?

1641
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:11,099
Boy's weekend?
(cell phone rings)

1642
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:12,668
- [Larry] Oh shit.

1643
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:14,670
- What?

1644
01:16:14,703 --> 01:16:17,639
(cell phone rings)

1645
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,477
- We gon' get on up outta here.

1646
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:23,946
- Where the hell's he goin'?

1647
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:26,682
- I got my Fig Newtons in there.

1648
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:31,853
Hey, what's your problem, man?

1649
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,088
- Get outta there!

1650
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:34,289
- [Ted] What do
you need this for?

1651
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:36,158
You don't need this,
you're camping!

1652
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:37,292
- [Wife] Let me get him.

1653
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:41,530
(blow thudding)
(groaning)

1654
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:45,734
(orchestral music)

1655
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:16,698
- Hey guy, can I use your phone?

1656
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:17,599
- No.

1657
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:21,069
- Is there a
payphone around here?

1658
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:23,472
- They still have those?

1659
01:17:23,505 --> 01:17:26,775
There's a cell phone
store right there.

1660
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,646
- Okay.

1661
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:32,147
Sure, no problem.

1662
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:35,550
Yeah, and I'll sign
you up tomorrow.

1663
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:38,053
I gotta go, a creepy
dude just walked in.

1664
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:39,321
Hi, I'm Chaz, can I help you?

1665
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:40,655
- I need to make a phone call.

1666
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:41,490
- Don't we all?

1667
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:42,424
That's why we're here.

1668
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:43,892
- No, no, I need to make a call.

1669
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:45,761
- Please don't, sir, don't
touch the phone, okay?

1670
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:46,695
Don't touch it.

1671
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:47,963
Let me show you the Ultanium.

1672
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:49,498
- The Ultanium?
- Look at that.

1673
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:53,368
Yeah, it's between platinum
and ultimate, the Ultanium.

1674
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:59,141
- If you're ultimate
already, right,

1675
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:02,577
you're like ultimate, why
do you need to be platinum?

1676
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:03,879
It doesn't really matter.

1677
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:05,681
I just need to make
one call please.

1678
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:07,549
- Please sir, don't
touch my phone.

1679
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:08,717
- Okay, okay.

1680
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:12,421
- Look at this Ultanium,
are you kiddin' me?

1681
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:15,924
This baby's got a camera
that'll blow the red away.

1682
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:17,626
Okay, look at that.

1683
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:18,527
And, and,

1684
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:22,064
it's got a GPS in the sky.

1685
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:23,298
Ain't that awesome?

1686
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:25,734
Plus it'll take
your fingerprints

1687
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:28,503
and store all your
information, and guess what?

1688
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:30,105
You never have to worry
about your information again,

1689
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:31,206
you know why?

1690
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:32,407
Hey, look at me.

1691
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:35,710
'Cause it's right
here on the Ultanium.

1692
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:38,980
- Can I like stick my
tool in it and screw it?

1693
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:41,483
- Well sir, that's
disgusting, but no.

1694
01:18:41,516 --> 01:18:43,218
Not on this version.

1695
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:45,253
- Maybe I wasn't being clear.

1696
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:46,988
I just need to
make a phone call.

1697
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:48,023
- [Chaz] On the phone.

1698
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,191
- No, on your shoe, guy.

1699
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:50,492
Yeah, on the phone.

1700
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:51,426
- You're getting irate.

1701
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,295
- [Ted] (groaning) Can I just--

1702
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:54,529
- Sir, don't touch my phone.

1703
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:57,666
- Okay, I don't
need a new phone,

1704
01:18:57,699 --> 01:19:00,869
I got a phone, I got two phones.

1705
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:02,337
I had two phones.

1706
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:07,843
- [Chaz] Sir, take a breath.

1707
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:10,612
- This did nothing for me.

1708
01:19:10,645 --> 01:19:12,447
- So that's a no on the phone?

1709
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:14,783
- [Ted] That's a no.

1710
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:15,617
That's a no.

1711
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:16,518
- Asshole.

1712
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:18,854
Hello?

1713
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:20,188
Yes, thank you.

1714
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,696
(bright music)

1715
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:43,245
- [Ted] And uh,

1716
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:47,182
that's how we got
to where we are?

1717
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:51,052
- Sometimes we get downtime.

1718
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:54,022
Because we're the suburbs, we
don't get as many criminals

1719
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:55,824
as the city does, so.

1720
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:58,426
In our downtime

1721
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,763
we crack some jokes.

1722
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:05,267
So here, I got an
old joke for you.

1723
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,469
This guy's out in a boat,
he's in the middle of nowhere

1724
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:11,573
in the ocean, he's
lost, prayin' to God.

1725
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:14,176
And so the boat comes by.

1726
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:18,346
Boaters look at him and go
hey, you need some help?

1727
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:22,417
Guy goes no, I got faith
in God, I'm gonna be fine.

1728
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:26,955
So they pull away and then
a helicopter comes by,

1729
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:30,192
sees the guy, comes down, hey
buddy, you need some help?

1730
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:34,563
He says no, no, I got faith
in God, I'm gonna be fine.

1731
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:36,398
Helicopter goes away.

1732
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:40,235
Couple of days the guy dies.

1733
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:43,471
Goes up to heaven, he meets God.

1734
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,507
He says, God, what happened?

1735
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:49,211
I had faith in you and
you didn't help me.

1736
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:52,113
And God says, "I sent a
boat and a helicopter,

1737
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:55,450
"what the hell are
you doing here?"

1738
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:58,320
- That's good, I mean it's uh,

1739
01:20:58,353 --> 01:20:59,588
I'm not a God guy

1740
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:03,158
so I don't know if I'm
following the point.

1741
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:05,760
- Your husband, wife, whatever.

1742
01:21:05,794 --> 01:21:07,696
He asked to help.

1743
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:12,033
Your boss asked to help
you, your friend Larry.

1744
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:13,635
You really want to
find out the hard way

1745
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:17,072
that that's the only help
you're ever gonna get?

1746
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:19,407
(knocking)

1747
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:23,645
- Oh, divine intervention.

1748
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:25,614
- Okay, you can go now.

1749
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:33,121
- You know Ted, it's alright
not havin' all the answers.

1750
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:35,991
In fact, sometimes knowin'
that you don't know

1751
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:38,793
all the answers is the
most important thing.

1752
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:41,896
'Cause then you can truly be.

1753
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:44,966
But when it comes
to your husband...

1754
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:51,106
The best part of this job

1755
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:54,776
is when I get to ask
questions and listen.

1756
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:59,981
You'd be amazed how
far that'll get you.

1757
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,285
- Thank you.

1758
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:06,588
- Don't be such an asshole.

1759
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:20,402
- Turns out a pedestrian
was recording with his phone

1760
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:22,570
the robbery inside the store.

1761
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:26,508
He posted it on YouTube,
owner identified the thief,

1762
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:29,811
the department sends
their deepest apologies.

1763
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:31,246
- YouTube.

1764
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:33,682
- Please, YouTube
saved you, pal.

1765
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:35,650
- A turd this big.

1766
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:36,818
Your fat ass?

1767
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:39,754
Yeah, okay, okay.

1768
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,222
- I had a turd that big but
it didn't stand a chance.

1769
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:43,191
When you took a look
at me, I clenched.

1770
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:45,126
- Yeah, I bet you did.

1771
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,428
- [Ted] Oh shit.

1772
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:47,996
- I called Jack,
he didn't pick up,

1773
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:50,432
so when I called your dad
they were on the golf course

1774
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:52,667
and they insisted
I come get 'em.

1775
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:54,669
- Hey, hey you.

1776
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:56,304
Get your butt in
the car right now.

1777
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:58,273
- You took us off
the golf course.

1778
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:01,042
What did I tell you about the
goddamn golf course, Teddy?

1779
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:02,477
Huh, you little turd?

1780
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:03,311
- Hey, where you goin'?

1781
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:04,612
Get back here!

1782
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,481
- Out in, in out, what
do you want me to do?

1783
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:07,349
Where do you want me to go?

1784
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:08,550
What are we doin'?

1785
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:09,718
- [Chuck] Hey watch
it, smart-ass.

1786
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:12,354
- Okay, the golf
course is sacred, okay?

1787
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:15,790
That is my time
away from the world.

1788
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:16,958
- Listen to me.

1789
01:23:16,991 --> 01:23:18,560
I hate the internet.

1790
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:20,362
I hate phones.

1791
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:22,263
Ever since your
mother abandoned us

1792
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:23,732
with that guy from MySpace--

1793
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:24,966
- His name was Tom.

1794
01:23:24,999 --> 01:23:26,801
- I told you never to
mention his name again!

1795
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,303
- My bad!
- Alright?

1796
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:32,507
- Yes, yes, Tom will never be
said out of my mouth again.

1797
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:35,877
- But the internet is
a part of our life now.

1798
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:38,847
It's an evil that we
have to face, okay?

1799
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,182
It's like anal warts.

1800
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:43,551
It's somethin' we
have to deal with.

1801
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:45,887
And if you don't deal
with the internet, son,

1802
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,989
you're gonna end up alone.

1803
01:23:48,022 --> 01:23:50,392
And it's gonna be sad, okay?

1804
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:54,429
So here's what we're gonna do.

1805
01:23:54,462 --> 01:23:56,097
Now you married up.

1806
01:23:57,499 --> 01:24:00,969
So we're gonna go home and
you're gonna apologize.

1807
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:03,671
'Cause you don't wanna
lose this marriage

1808
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:08,543
because of somethin' on
Google, are you kidding me?

1809
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:10,545
- He met someone.

1810
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:11,880
- What?

1811
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:14,015
- The Latin guy.
- Oh, Christ.

1812
01:24:14,048 --> 01:24:15,717
- Yeah, on Facebook.

1813
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,653
- Well, then you're gonna fight.

1814
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:20,054
Not the Latin guy,

1815
01:24:20,088 --> 01:24:21,489
'cause he'd kick your butt.
- Oh, he'd kill him.

1816
01:24:21,523 --> 01:24:22,824
- Maybe if he was an
Asian you'd have a chance.

1817
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:24,025
- Asian, maybe.

1818
01:24:24,058 --> 01:24:26,661
- You're gonna fight
for your marriage, okay?

1819
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:28,530
Listen to me.

1820
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:31,466
I didn't raise an asshole, okay?

1821
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:33,968
Steve here, Steve is an asshole.

1822
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:36,738
- Oh, go to hell,
everyone loves me.

1823
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:37,639
- Son.

1824
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,776
Let's go home and
make this happen.

1825
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:44,312
Alright?

1826
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:45,947
Hey.

1827
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,782
Let's fight for this.

1828
01:24:57,725 --> 01:24:59,227
Hey, remember.

1829
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:00,195
- Yeah?

1830
01:25:00,228 --> 01:25:02,430
- Your guy, he's the best.

1831
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:04,432
Son.

1832
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,102
You're not so bad yourself.

1833
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,269
- Thanks Dad.

1834
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:11,973
- Hey, yo yo yo, listen to me.

1835
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:13,775
Beg for your damn
job back, okay?

1836
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:16,511
Tell them you got that
PTSD thing from technology

1837
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:17,679
or some bullshit like that

1838
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:20,882
because they cannot fight that.

1839
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:23,051
- Alright Uncle Stevie,
that's what I'm gonna do.

1840
01:25:23,084 --> 01:25:24,352
- Okay.
- Good, good idea.

1841
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:26,654
- You're a good one, dummy.

1842
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:39,567
- Oh God, I'm too late.

1843
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:41,569
George,

1844
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:44,172
that's my husband.

1845
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:46,374
Okay.

1846
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:51,913
I know you've been a
better man than me lately.

1847
01:25:51,946 --> 01:25:54,482
I know you've been
listening to him

1848
01:25:54,516 --> 01:25:57,519
and I haven't been
listening to him.

1849
01:25:57,552 --> 01:26:00,088
I know you've been
spendin' time with him,

1850
01:26:00,121 --> 01:26:03,725
I know you've been talkin'
to him about his work,

1851
01:26:03,758 --> 01:26:05,093
and why wouldn't you?

1852
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:06,961
Jack's a superhero.

1853
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:09,797
Fightin' for equality every day.

1854
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:13,968
I get it, and here I am, I'm
pissin' away my marriage.

1855
01:26:15,069 --> 01:26:16,371
- [Jack] Shut

1856
01:26:16,404 --> 01:26:17,272
up.

1857
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:22,577
- Alright, look, okay.

1858
01:26:23,945 --> 01:26:27,382
I knew your husband
in high school.

1859
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:30,385
Alright, we were best friends.

1860
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:32,787
And also we've never had sex

1861
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:35,757
and I promise you we never will.

1862
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:39,594
I mean, to be quite
honest, he's not my type.

1863
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:46,568
Hold on, did you,
did you tell him?

1864
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:47,569
- [Jack] No, I didn't.

1865
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:48,670
- So he doesn't know.

1866
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:50,772
- [Jack] He does not know.

1867
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:51,673
- Okay.

1868
01:26:53,074 --> 01:26:54,642
I'm gonna share
somethin' with you

1869
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:57,712
and promise that
you'll just listen?

1870
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,281
I was assigned

1871
01:27:01,616 --> 01:27:03,151
a vagina at birth.

1872
01:27:09,691 --> 01:27:11,092
- Ted,

1873
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:13,428
George was once Georgeanne.

1874
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:21,669
- No, I never really
was Georgeanne.

1875
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,442
That was all my
assigned name and sex.

1876
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:31,212
But I've always been George.

1877
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:36,084
- (exhaling) Wow.

1878
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:38,386
(laughing)

1879
01:27:41,556 --> 01:27:42,991
Ah, wow.

1880
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:44,726
You know, a wise guy

1881
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:47,996
told me I need to

1882
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:51,299
ask more questions.

1883
01:27:53,234 --> 01:27:55,536
Do a little more listening.

1884
01:27:56,938 --> 01:28:01,142
Now probably would have been
the time to do that, huh?

1885
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:06,180
- I'm gonna, you know I'm
gonna leave you two be.

1886
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:07,081
Come here.

1887
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:15,523
Just tell him you love him, Ted.

1888
01:28:24,332 --> 01:28:26,334
- George moved back
to town last month

1889
01:28:26,367 --> 01:28:29,337
and didn't really
have any friends.

1890
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,974
A lot of people
weren't very kind

1891
01:28:33,007 --> 01:28:35,376
to his reassignment surgery.

1892
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:40,715
It's been a process
to say the least.

1893
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:48,623
That's why I've been hangin'
out with him so much.

1894
01:28:50,858 --> 01:28:54,329
- I know I've been a
little crazy lately.

1895
01:28:57,432 --> 01:28:58,299
But um...

1896
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:02,937
if you'll still have me,

1897
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:05,907
I'd like just one thing.

1898
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:09,377
- What's that?

1899
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,048
- I just want moments.

1900
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:18,219
I just want moments with you.

1901
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:24,292
- Ted.

1902
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:29,330
Ted, I will give you moments

1903
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:31,132
for the rest of your life,

1904
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:33,201
forever more and always.

1905
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:35,103
Okay?

1906
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:39,173
We'll work on it, together.

1907
01:29:41,809 --> 01:29:42,677
But Ted,

1908
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:46,547
all I've ever wanted from you

1909
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:50,418
was at the end of the
day, you come home.

1910
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:53,054
(gentle music)

1911
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:56,357
Oh God.

1912
01:29:58,526 --> 01:30:00,394
Your meltdown at work?

1913
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:03,865
A million views.

1914
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:04,766
Viral.

1915
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:07,068
Your boyfriend
Barry recorded it.

1916
01:30:07,101 --> 01:30:08,136
- Oh my God.

1917
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:11,439
Come on.

1918
01:30:15,009 --> 01:30:15,877
- Ted.

1919
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:20,414
You and your husband
have sex, it goes viral.

1920
01:30:20,448 --> 01:30:21,916
- Mm hmm.

1921
01:30:21,949 --> 01:30:24,919
- You lose your job at work,
and the video goes viral.

1922
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:26,487
- Mm hmm.

1923
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:31,058
- You're gonna be famous
like another three minutes?

1924
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:33,127
Write your third act.

1925
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:34,529
Tell your story.

1926
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:40,134
- Well,

1927
01:30:41,335 --> 01:30:42,570
I'm probably gonna need

1928
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:45,773
a lot of our savings
account to do that.

1929
01:30:47,408 --> 01:30:49,177
- [Jack] So no house?

1930
01:30:54,982 --> 01:30:57,218
- Wow is this really happening?

1931
01:30:57,251 --> 01:30:58,486
- I will be honest,

1932
01:30:58,519 --> 01:31:00,888
there's a chance my
heart can't take this.

1933
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:03,124
I just don't believe this.

1934
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:07,462
(orchestral music)

1935
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:20,975
(laughing)

1936
01:31:21,008 --> 01:31:23,211
- Ah, oh, hey, hey there, whoa.

1937
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:24,545
- We were told to come
to the Edison entrance,

1938
01:31:24,579 --> 01:31:26,047
this is Edison, please.

1939
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,415
- Hi, I'm Chuck, this is
Steve, we're on the list.

1940
01:31:27,448 --> 01:31:28,950
- I don't know who, who are you?

1941
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:30,952
- Bob, Bob, it's okay.

1942
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:31,886
Are you Chuck and Steve?

1943
01:31:31,919 --> 01:31:32,954
- Yes, we are Chuck and Steve.

1944
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:34,455
- You're with me, come with me.

1945
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:37,992
- We're goin' in, we're
going in, we're going in!

1946
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:40,094
- Not my responsibility
once you're past that line.

1947
01:31:40,127 --> 01:31:42,763
- You're gonna look like
that in like 20 years, so...

1948
01:31:42,797 --> 01:31:43,931
- I am aware.

1949
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:48,035
(orchestral music)

1950
01:32:06,454 --> 01:32:07,555
- Whoa, whoa.

1951
01:32:08,923 --> 01:32:09,790
Oh my God.

1952
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:13,761
Oh my God, oh my God, this
is the best day of my life!

1953
01:32:13,794 --> 01:32:14,896
- This is real.

1954
01:32:14,929 --> 01:32:15,730
This is so nice.

1955
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:16,797
- Oh my God.

1956
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:23,471

1968
01:32:48,496 --> 01:32:49,864
But who's counting?

1969
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:50,932
- We are.

1970
01:32:50,965 --> 01:32:52,199
- Yeah, we are.

1971
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:55,202

(orchestral music)

1976
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:14,221
- [Steve] Shit,

1977
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:16,524
- Whoa, you gotta
sign a release.

1978
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:18,459
- Oh kiss my ass, do you
know who this is, Larry?

1979
01:33:18,492 --> 01:33:19,460
- Alright, I know--

01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:21,395
I got this, I got this.

- All the years I been--
- Oh, hell no.

1982
01:33:23,364 --> 01:33:24,865

1983
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:26,634

01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:27,969
- Larry, Larry, Larry.

1985
01:33:28,002 --> 01:33:29,537
We'll square it away
later, it's all good.

1986
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:31,005
- They gotta sign a release.

1987
01:33:31,038 --> 01:33:33,274

No, I'm not signin'

- Steve, sign right there.

Get your dad, get your
dad, get your dad.

01:33:43,217 --> 01:33:45,119
- Yeah, yeah, I'll
go get my dad.

1993
01:33:45,152 --> 01:33:46,587
- Better respect my authority.

1994
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:48,823
- Yeah, I'm working on it.

1995
01:33:50,992 --> 01:33:53,260
(shouting)

1996
01:33:57,498 --> 01:34:00,201
- You look so good, look at you.

1997
01:34:01,569 --> 01:34:04,305
- Alright Dad, Uncle Steve,
let's get movin', let's do this.

1998
01:34:04,338 --> 01:34:05,139

2000
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:07,908
- Tell me when.

2001
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:10,845
- Alright.

2002
01:34:10,878 --> 01:34:11,712
Action.

2003
01:34:15,449 --> 01:34:17,585
(grunts)

2004
01:34:19,854 --> 01:34:22,823
- I heard he's
throwin' some hooks.

2005
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:25,659
(sighs)

2006
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:34,769
(chuckles)

2007
01:34:42,376 --> 01:34:43,177
- Sh sh sh.

2008
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:45,479
(cheering)

2009
01:34:50,718 --> 01:34:51,819
- That's so cool.
- He did it!

2010
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:53,020
- That's so cool.

2011
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:53,954
He actually got the
home run, right?

2012
01:34:53,988 --> 01:34:55,122
That's what that thing is?

2013
01:34:55,156 --> 01:34:56,424
- That is a home run.
- That's so fun.

2014
01:34:56,457 --> 01:34:59,827
(laughing and cheering)

2015
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:05,966
- Okay listen, never too
old for an autograph, okay?

2016
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,368
- Oh my God, you're
embarrassing our family!

2017
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:09,904
No, don't do that.
- Come on, I can't--

2018
01:35:09,937 --> 01:35:11,505
- Here, sign my ball too.

2019
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:13,941
Well, you did it first.

2020
01:35:13,974 --> 01:35:15,943
- Wow, amazing.

2021
01:35:15,976 --> 01:35:18,512
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, okay,

2022
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,414
okay, nice, it's nice.

2023
01:35:24,518 --> 01:35:27,388
- You, you set me
up and you know it!

2024
01:35:27,421 --> 01:35:31,125
With your whore intern
and your whore mouth!

2025
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:44,472
(crying)

2026
01:35:44,505 --> 01:35:45,372
- What?

2027
01:35:48,609 --> 01:35:49,810
- [Ted] Fiona.

2028
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:51,812
- Ted.

2029
01:35:53,514 --> 01:35:54,815
Ted.

2030
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:55,716
Oh, Ted.

2031
01:35:57,051 --> 01:35:58,252
You came back.

2032
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,423
I have a feeling
that this was yours.

2033
01:36:02,456 --> 01:36:04,325
- Hey, that's my pen!

2034
01:36:04,358 --> 01:36:06,927
Oh, I've been looking
all over for this.

2035
01:36:06,961 --> 01:36:08,295
- Well somebody put it
in my desk this morning

2036
01:36:08,329 --> 01:36:10,965
with a note that said "play me."

2037
01:36:15,035 --> 01:36:16,771
- [Barry] Why don't
you just come over

2038
01:36:16,804 --> 01:36:19,273
and we can watch
Netflix and chill?

2039
01:36:19,306 --> 01:36:20,941
- [Sally] Netflix and chill?

2040
01:36:20,975 --> 01:36:23,077
Smooth, Barry, no.

2041
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:25,179
- [Barry] You're afraid
because I'm the boss now,

2042
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:27,915
I get it, let's just
not tell anyone.

2043
01:36:27,948 --> 01:36:30,050
- [Sally] Take your
hand off me Barry,

2044
01:36:30,084 --> 01:36:32,086
you've got one second.

2045
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:33,554
- [Barry] Come on, let's just--

2046
01:36:33,587 --> 01:36:37,591
- [Sally] I am not some
slag for you to trifle with.

2047
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,260
- [Barry] Oh.

2048
01:36:39,293 --> 01:36:40,161
- Oh.

2049
01:36:41,095 --> 01:36:42,396
Timmy,

2050
01:36:42,429 --> 01:36:43,798
come here honey.

2051
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:47,301
It's about to get better.

2052
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:49,803
Timmy, why don't
you sit right here

2053
01:36:49,837 --> 01:36:51,372
and share with Ted

2054
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:55,142
what you shared with
me this morning.

2055
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:56,277
- Do I have to?

2056
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:58,646
- [Fiona] Yes
sweetie, you have to.

2057
01:36:58,679 --> 01:36:59,547
- Barry...

2058
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:01,448
touched me.

2059
01:37:03,884 --> 01:37:04,752
- Gross.

2060
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:09,924
Does that surprise you?

2061
01:37:09,957 --> 01:37:12,693
- Well, actually Ted, can I
just get a selfie with you?

2062
01:37:12,726 --> 01:37:14,929
My classmates would freak.

2063
01:37:20,234 --> 01:37:23,771
- Well that is so
cute, that is so cute.

2064
01:37:23,804 --> 01:37:26,907
So Ted, this little production
of Glen Garry Glen Ross

2065
01:37:26,941 --> 01:37:29,810
that you put on in my
office the other morning

2066
01:37:29,843 --> 01:37:32,680
has hit the internet
like hotcakes.

2067
01:37:32,713 --> 01:37:34,114
Yeah, people are praising you,

2068
01:37:34,148 --> 01:37:37,051
they love your
rants on technology.

2069
01:37:37,084 --> 01:37:38,519
(laughing)

2070
01:37:38,552 --> 01:37:41,622
And yeah, of course, Barry
is an immature pervert

2071
01:37:41,655 --> 01:37:43,457
which you know, we're screwed.

2072
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:44,858
I would tell you

2073
01:37:46,126 --> 01:37:48,429
that you're still fired but

2074
01:37:49,797 --> 01:37:52,967
I don't think that there's
much of a firm left

2075
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,401
so it really doesn't ma-,

2076
01:37:54,435 --> 01:37:56,237
why are you laughing?

2077
01:37:57,538 --> 01:37:58,739
- Fiona?

2078
01:37:58,772 --> 01:37:59,640
Hi.

2079
01:38:00,774 --> 01:38:03,310
Relax, 'cause we
got the solution.

2080
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:06,947
- Why, why live?

2081
01:38:08,649 --> 01:38:12,720
I'm scared, I'm scared,
but a little bit excited.

2082
01:38:20,861 --> 01:38:22,830
Tell me something good.

2083
01:38:24,665 --> 01:38:27,501
(dramatic music)

2084
01:38:27,534 --> 01:38:31,739
- Get off the phone, you'll
want to experience this.

2085
01:38:34,608 --> 01:38:36,710
(grunts)

2086
01:38:37,778 --> 01:38:40,314
- I heard he's
throwin' some hooks.

2087
01:38:40,347 --> 01:38:41,215
- Alright.

2088
01:38:44,718 --> 01:38:45,919
(bat knocks ball)

2089
01:38:45,953 --> 01:38:48,222
(cheering)

2090
01:38:50,991 --> 01:38:52,927
- [Announcer] Chicago
Cubs baseball.

2091
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,496
Bringing generations together.

2092
01:38:58,165 --> 01:38:59,033
- I don't,

2093
01:39:00,334 --> 01:39:03,037
how did you, what, how?

2094
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:06,674
- So we're gonna take
this to the Cubs.

2095
01:39:06,707 --> 01:39:10,411
And tell them that we want
10 more of these commercials.

2096
01:39:10,444 --> 01:39:15,082
Bringing generations
together by playing the game.

2097
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:19,320
Bring your kids and actually
spend quality time together.

2098
01:39:20,654 --> 01:39:23,691
Put down the phone,
get in the game.

2099
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:27,027
- Oh.

2100
01:39:28,095 --> 01:39:28,963
Oh.

2101
01:39:30,064 --> 01:39:32,800
I don't know what to
say, you can smile now.

2102
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:34,935
- You're gonna say that
Ted gets his job back.

2103
01:39:34,968 --> 01:39:36,003
- Of course.

2104
01:39:38,472 --> 01:39:39,973
- Ted.

2105
01:39:40,007 --> 01:39:40,874
Teddy.

2106
01:39:42,276 --> 01:39:46,947
We just want you to know, we
had your back the whole time.

2107
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,449
- The whole time.

2108
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:51,618
And we just want you to know
how much we have to offer.

2109
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:53,087
You know as like a team.

2110
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:55,289
- I will make out
with you right now.

2111
01:39:55,322 --> 01:39:56,657
Hard.

2112
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:58,258
Like I really will do it.

2113
01:39:58,292 --> 01:40:01,028
I am not above sleeping
with you to keep my job.

2114
01:40:01,061 --> 01:40:03,364
- Jeffrey.
- Shut up.

2115
01:40:03,397 --> 01:40:04,264
- God.

2116
01:40:06,633 --> 01:40:07,935
- Wow, alright.

2117
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:12,539
We're gonna need as many
hands on deck as possible.

2118
01:40:12,573 --> 01:40:15,209
I mean, this is Fiona Sanders PR

2119
01:40:15,242 --> 01:40:17,611
and they know everything
we're doing here

2120
01:40:17,644 --> 01:40:19,313
and everything, I mean,

2121
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:23,550
yeah, I mean I don't see any
harm in keeping them around.

2122
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:29,590
Why don't we send them
on their first mission?

2123
01:40:32,092 --> 01:40:33,694
Four coffees, boys.

2124
01:40:34,595 --> 01:40:36,430
Oh, and a bourbon for the lady.

2125
01:40:36,463 --> 01:40:38,098
- Light bourbon.

2126
01:40:38,132 --> 01:40:39,500
- Oh yeah, okay.

2127
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:44,204
Fiona, I really, really

2128
01:40:47,174 --> 01:40:48,375
owe my husband

2129
01:40:49,676 --> 01:40:51,745
a house.
- Oh do you?

2130
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:53,914
- Yeah, and I would say a

2131
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:57,751
10% raise would probably go

2132
01:40:57,785 --> 01:41:00,988
a long way towards
making that happen.

2133
01:41:02,923 --> 01:41:03,857
- 10%.

2134
01:41:06,794 --> 01:41:07,661
Yeah.

2135
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:13,367
- [Ted] I love you.

2136
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:15,135
- I love you too.

2137
01:41:15,169 --> 01:41:16,603
I love you so much.

2138
01:41:16,637 --> 01:41:17,738
- Alright,

2139
01:41:17,771 --> 01:41:19,239
Ted.

2140
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:20,874
My friend, you are never
gonna get this lucky again

2141
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:23,143
so go ahead and make
love to your sweet man

2142
01:41:23,177 --> 01:41:24,611
right here in my boardroom.

2143
01:41:24,645 --> 01:41:26,480
- I'm gonna.
- That's right.

2144
01:41:26,513 --> 01:41:27,548
- Thank you.

2145
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:36,290
- Oh yeah, this
is so going viral.

2146
01:41:37,257 --> 01:41:38,192
Back to it.

2147
01:41:39,326 --> 01:41:42,296
(orchestral music)

2148
01:41:44,498 --> 01:41:48,202
(orchestral music swelling)

2149
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:32,679
(pop music)

2150
01:42:57,671 --> 01:43:00,140
