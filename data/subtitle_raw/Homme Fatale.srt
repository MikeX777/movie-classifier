1
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:18,624
How lovely!

2
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:28,634
Sir?

3
00:01:32,237 --> 00:01:33,639
Sir!

4
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:40,846
Where is painter Heo Sek's house?

5
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,851
I heard it's around here.

6
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:51,536
There's a house

7
00:01:51,657 --> 00:01:52,618
up the hill that way.

8
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:55,260
Thank you, sir.

9
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:10,435
Excuse me.

10
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:18,203
Oh my.

11
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:22,287
Are you Heo Sek, sir?

12
00:02:22,928 --> 00:02:24,209
Isn't it pretty?

13
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:36,261
How did you arrive here faster than me?

14
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:38,303
I took the shortcut.

15
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:40,746
Why not walk with
me in the first place?

16
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:42,628
I got lost.

17
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:45,671
Then I'd want to hold hands.

18
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:47,953
Silly old man...

19
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:49,915
Is he senile?

20
00:02:57,763 --> 00:02:59,965
He really is a painter.

21
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,452
What a peculiar drawing.

22
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:09,575
What's so peculiar about it?

23
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:14,019
Why is a little boy

24
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:16,982
surrounded by gisaengs?

25
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:20,345
Men are jealous of that boy.

26
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:24,549
Men and gisaengs...

27
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:27,272
Oh my.

28
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:29,995
I don't know who the boy is,

29
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:33,558
but I can guess how he turned out.

30
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:37,002
That little boy is me.

31
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:41,526
What? It's you, sir?

32
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:43,448
Why were you with gisaengs?

33
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:44,650
Curious?

34
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:48,814
I'm not that curious.

35
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:49,735
Very well, then.

36
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,336
I'm curious.

37
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,702
I was born in a gibang.

38
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:58,584
A gibang?

39
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:03,068
The gisaengs were my family,

40
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:05,390
and the flowers were my friends.

41
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:08,674
I was born the son of a gisaeng

42
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:11,717
and was a gibang boy
who grew up in a gibang.

43
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:13,919
What happened? Why?

44
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,280
What did you do there?

45
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,281
How long?

46
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:17,803
Why are you here now?

47
00:04:18,483 --> 00:04:20,245
Why are you so curious?

48
00:04:20,365 --> 00:04:24,369
Well, it's to pass time
as you draw me, sir.

49
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:30,776
Now, shall I begin?

50
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:41,987
What?

51
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:44,189
Do I look weird?

52
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:45,310
My eyes...

53
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:48,033
You're dazzling.

54
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:49,795
Goodness.

55
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,637
You're being silly.

56
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:54,039
No. This is wrong.

57
00:04:57,002 --> 00:04:58,043
What are you doing?

58
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:01,566
Take off your slip.

59
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:03,849
What? Even this?

60
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:09,575
Wearing this won't hide it.

61
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:10,896
Hide what?

62
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:13,939
Your beauty.

63
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,502
- Goodness!
- Oh, no!

64
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:20,586
Your beauty is slipping through!

65
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:22,427
Here. And here.

66
00:05:22,547 --> 00:05:24,590
- Stop!
- And here.

67
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:28,513
Aunt! Wait!

68
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:29,875
Listen to me!

69
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:31,476
Carry on!

70
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,557
Hello!

71
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:33,558
I can explain!

72
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:34,680
Follow me!

73
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:39,645
You slimy fool!

74
00:05:40,886 --> 00:05:41,927
What do you mean?

75
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:44,650
You loaf around and do nothing!

76
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,451
You womanizer!

77
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:47,973
You flirt with family now?

78
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:49,014
You filthy bastard!

79
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:50,736
I wasn't flirting!

80
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,819
I was just asked to draw her portrait.

81
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,861
A portrait.

82
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,624
A portrait? Don't fool me!

83
00:05:59,905 --> 00:06:02,027
Though you can't work for the state,

84
00:06:02,147 --> 00:06:03,909
try to be successful!

85
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:05,831
Why aren't you studying?

86
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:09,635
What success for a
humble son of a gisaeng?

87
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:12,477
Why would I study

88
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:13,839
if I can't take the state exam?

89
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,481
You can take the translator exam!

90
00:06:16,722 --> 00:06:18,083
It was your mother's wish.

91
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,410
What?

92
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,454
They're words from Thailand,
a country far south of China.

93
00:06:31,096 --> 00:06:32,057
Aunt.

94
00:06:32,457 --> 00:06:36,101
It means, "I just want
to live an idle life."

95
00:06:36,782 --> 00:06:37,983
Come in, Gap-deok!

96
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:40,746
- Throw him out of my house!
- Aunt.

97
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:41,827
But...

98
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:44,630
I've been patient with
you as your mom's friend,

99
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,711
but no more!

100
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,633
Throw him out at once!

101
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:49,514
Think of your friendship
with my mother!

102
00:06:49,795 --> 00:06:52,718
Aunt! Please! Stop!

103
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:53,639
Aunt!

104
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,440
Don't call me Aunt!

105
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,002
Madam...

106
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:04,770
Saw that?

107
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:11,056
Then I'll go hang out.

108
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:12,137
Sek?

109
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:14,900
Sook-jung.

110
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,981
Are you all right?

111
00:07:16,822 --> 00:07:18,063
Don't worry.

112
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:19,985
She won't be angry

113
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:21,426
if I return a few days later.

114
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:24,029
Sweetheart, listen well to the others.

115
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,071
And eat well.

116
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:29,915
Come back soon.

117
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:48,574
- See the flower in his hair?
- He's beautiful!

118
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:53,098
Kim Nam-hoon's wife, Park.

119
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,823
Ko Tae-young's wife, Kim.

120
00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:02,027
Kang Hun-woo's wife, Lee.

121
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:06,752
Choi Mun-chang's wife, Shim.

122
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:10,235
Lee Chan-nam's wife, Park.

123
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:12,517
Shim Yeon's wife, Lee.

124
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:13,518
<i>Virtuous Women Hall</i>

125
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,040
Virtuous Women Hall?

126
00:08:16,842 --> 00:08:18,083
Preposterous!

127
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:21,526
- Pain...
- Pain is borne by women,

128
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:25,130
but others receive the credit.

129
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:38,584
It is bestowed on them in praise
of being chaste and devoted...

130
00:08:38,704 --> 00:08:40,305
Wait, my lady!

131
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:50,075
My lady? Who is she?

132
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:54,920
I should've asked for her name.

133
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,821
What?

134
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,223
Why are you here like that?

135
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:20,305
Ever heard of the Way?

136
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:22,267
No.

137
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:26,752
I'm an ascetic who lived in the
hills and sought enlightenment.

138
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,036
Just before I reached perfection,

139
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:32,758
I met some bandits.

140
00:09:32,878 --> 00:09:36,682
Oh, you're not a bandit? I see.

141
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:38,164
Still,

142
00:09:38,284 --> 00:09:39,085
why walk around like that?

143
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:41,087
Come empty, return empty.

144
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:45,171
You're born naked and die naked.

145
00:09:46,092 --> 00:09:48,935
What good are clothes?

146
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:53,660
No! Stay back!

147
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,381
No!

148
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,944
- What's wrong?
- Stay back!

149
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:58,985
Are you ill?

150
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:00,226
No, I'm okay.

151
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:01,748
At least put this on.

152
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,270
I have no need for clothes!

153
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:06,993
Stop moving! It's dangling!

154
00:10:07,794 --> 00:10:10,076
- It's just natural.
- Stop! No!

155
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:11,878
Mother!

156
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,963
That was good!

157
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:20,206
That hit the spot.

158
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:27,654
You know, this is a tavern,

159
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:30,977
not a restaurant.

160
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:35,942
That means we have to order drinks.

161
00:10:36,062 --> 00:10:38,945
Ascetics drink alcohol?

162
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:44,430
Just as Master Wonhyo
drank water from a skull,

163
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,233
if you think it's booze, it's booze.

164
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:51,237
But if you think it's honey
water, it'll become honey water.

165
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:59,365
An ascetic, my foot.

166
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:06,573
Drink! I love drinking!

167
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:11,137
Drink! I love drinking!

168
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:13,139
Open the gates!

169
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:16,182
Isn't this a gibang?

170
00:11:18,184 --> 00:11:20,867
When cast out of your
home, bring a friend.

171
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,070
That's the way of life.

172
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,471
What?

173
00:11:27,914 --> 00:11:30,236
You fool! Why are you back?

174
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:33,760
My mom's waiting...

175
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,321
What mom?

176
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:38,164
Buddy! You owe me for the food!

177
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:40,286
That wasn't even much!

178
00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:42,048
What the...

179
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,490
You little brat!

180
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:48,294
You dare treat a guest like that?

181
00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:50,256
A guest?

182
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,337
Yes!

183
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:53,259
I came here as a guest.

184
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,263
Two guests coming through!

185
00:11:58,144 --> 00:11:58,945
What?

186
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:00,146
Dang!

187
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:05,151
This is pure honey!

188
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:07,073
Pour me another.

189
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:13,840
You're a grown man, now.

190
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,283
Should I get married to you?

191
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:21,287
We're family. That's wrong.

192
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:25,411
A dog would laugh to hear that.

193
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:28,695
If it smiled at me,

194
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,376
it must be a female.

195
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,701
With such hospitality,

196
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,502
I should rightfully repay you.

197
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:41,147
I can tell people's fortunes
by reading their faces.

198
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:43,189
Reading faces?

199
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,951
Very well.

200
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:53,199
You look like a gisaeng's brother.

201
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:54,761
- What?
- Nothing.

202
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:56,282
How dare you say that!

203
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:58,004
But you are our brother.

204
00:12:58,124 --> 00:12:59,525
Right.

205
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:04,170
A gisaeng's brother?

206
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,252
You're a gifted face reader!

207
00:13:06,372 --> 00:13:08,014
How did you know?

208
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:10,176
That's nothing.

209
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,257
What else?

210
00:13:11,377 --> 00:13:14,380
Let's see.

211
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:18,024
Your raccoon-like nose is

212
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:20,546
full of mischief and bluff.

213
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:24,390
Your goose-like eyes
contain signs of tears.

214
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,435
What a daring face!

215
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,239
There are signs of
love all over your face.

216
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:37,604
Usually, a reading
like this is for women.

217
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:39,926
He must resemble his mom.

218
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,207
Mom?

219
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,451
Hey!

220
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:46,893
What?

221
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:03,229
What's the rush?

222
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:04,591
Here.

223
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:11,157
I might not look it,

224
00:14:11,277 --> 00:14:13,359
but I'm half an aristocrat.

225
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,961
However,

226
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:17,163
I don't know who my father is.

227
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:24,090
Must be one of the aristocrats

228
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,893
who fooled around with my mom.

229
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:35,021
We haven't exchanged names yet.

230
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,625
I'm Heo Sek. And you?

231
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:42,108
Do you know the ten heavenly stems

232
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:44,550
and twelve earthly
branches of yin and yang?

233
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:48,635
Heavenly stems and earthly branches?

234
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:54,841
Wood, fire, earth, metal, water...

235
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,242
Ten heavenly stems!

236
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:58,124
Rat, ox, tiger, rabbit,
dragon, snake, horse, goat,

237
00:14:58,244 --> 00:15:01,487
monkey, rooster, dog, and
pig! Twelve earthly branches!

238
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:05,291
I read people's nature
and their fortunes.

239
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:09,656
I also studied the cultural sphere

240
00:15:09,936 --> 00:15:11,457
called the sexagenary cycle!

241
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,020
I mastered the sexagenary cycle!

242
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,983
I'm the master of the masters!

243
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:18,344
I'm Uke-gap!

244
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:20,226
Uke-gap.

245
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:21,668
That was dang long.

246
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:23,469
That was dang hard.

247
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:26,713
So Uke-gap.

248
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:33,159
As Yubi and his friends pledged
an oath at the Peach Garden,

249
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:38,004
let us pledge to be brothers
with this glass of liquor.

250
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:39,726
Sure!

251
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:41,888
Since we're at a gibang,

252
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,571
let's call it the Oath of the Gibang!

253
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:46,012
Oath of the Gibang?

254
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:51,177
- Wait!
- Let go!

255
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:53,099
You can't leave like this!

256
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,062
Then pay me what you owe!

257
00:15:56,743 --> 00:15:59,105
What about the girls?

258
00:16:00,186 --> 00:16:01,307
Please.

259
00:16:02,148 --> 00:16:03,509
I'm begging you.

260
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,151
It hurts!

261
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:07,313
If you don't pay me by
the end of the month,

262
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,435
you'll lose this place for good!

263
00:16:09,555 --> 00:16:11,117
No! Wait...

264
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:14,520
Ma'am!

265
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:20,246
Uke-gap? What are you drawing?

266
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:21,728
Laver.

267
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,489
What?

268
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,732
Laver!

269
00:16:26,212 --> 00:16:32,018
Laver? Then it should
be coated with perilla oil.

270
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:34,140
Hey, Choon-boon!

271
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,783
Choon...

272
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:41,467
Oh, ma'am!

273
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:47,594
Yes! You're my type!

274
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,436
Come here!

275
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,520
Lock them up

276
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:56,562
and hand them over to
the authorities at dawn!

277
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,566
Aunt! Please stop.

278
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,609
It's killing...

279
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:04,090
Harder!

280
00:17:04,571 --> 00:17:05,652
Why you!

281
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:08,695
Welcome!

282
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,699
It's nothing. Please come inside.

283
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:15,461
Wait! Help me!

284
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:17,624
Don't mind them, sir.

285
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:28,755
Why won't he shut up?

286
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:35,682
- Yes! You're my type.
- Let go!

287
00:17:35,802 --> 00:17:38,444
Come here.

288
00:17:38,564 --> 00:17:39,525
Sek?

289
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:41,608
Sook-jung!

290
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,371
Why are you out here?

291
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:46,693
What if Aunt catches you?

292
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:48,094
Hungry?

293
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,856
Eat this.

294
00:17:50,496 --> 00:17:51,658
And water.

295
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,542
- I must go.
- Sook-jung! Wait!

296
00:17:58,264 --> 00:17:59,826
Girls?

297
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:02,148
Come here.

298
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:03,469
Come close!

299
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:05,511
What's wrong?

300
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:06,753
Was someone mean to you?

301
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:08,314
That guest.

302
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:10,917
I've never seen a
guest so rude like that!

303
00:18:11,037 --> 00:18:14,761
He complained about
the food from the start.

304
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:16,042
Then he said the girls' makeup is

305
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:18,885
too dark or flashy

306
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:21,367
and refused all of them.

307
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:22,689
He came to vent his anger,

308
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,330
not to be entertained.

309
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,212
- I know!
- Right!

310
00:18:26,332 --> 00:18:27,293
Girls.

311
00:18:27,894 --> 00:18:30,697
Go tell Aunt I have something to say.

312
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:34,621
What? Why would you go in there?

313
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:37,784
Trust me. I'll take care of it.

314
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:42,188
You have no other choice.

315
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,271
How will you make money?

316
00:18:46,673 --> 00:18:47,634
Fine.

317
00:18:48,154 --> 00:18:51,437
But if you make this worse,

318
00:18:51,557 --> 00:18:54,360
I'll turn you into eunuchs.

319
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:58,925
I have no use for it anyway.

320
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:01,487
First,

321
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,851
I need to change.

322
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:14,180
How many bottles?

323
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,262
4 of our most expensive liquor!

324
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:19,545
We're racking up sales!

325
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,429
- Escort him out.
- Yes, ma'am.

326
00:19:25,592 --> 00:19:26,793
This way, please.

327
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:29,435
Take care, sir.

328
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,839
What did you do?

329
00:19:37,203 --> 00:19:38,805
You've lost your touch.

330
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:41,367
Can't you tell?

331
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:42,809
What?

332
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,693
That guest is...

333
00:19:48,695 --> 00:19:49,696
a woman!

334
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:54,741
What? Why would a
woman come to a gibang?

335
00:19:57,343 --> 00:19:58,985
She is a chaste widow.

336
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:02,829
The nights are long and lonely.

337
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:04,310
But as a virtuous woman,

338
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:07,634
she has nowhere to drink
and no friends to drink with.

339
00:20:07,754 --> 00:20:10,957
She dressed as a man in hopes
of finding someone to drink with

340
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:15,481
because gibangs are private places.

341
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:17,363
I see.

342
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:20,687
How did you know she was a woman?

343
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:24,851
I knew right away

344
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:26,252
when our eyes met in the yard.

345
00:20:26,653 --> 00:20:27,734
Her eyes...

346
00:20:29,616 --> 00:20:33,700
No man can look at me like that.

347
00:20:38,985 --> 00:20:40,787
Aunt! We had a deal!

348
00:20:41,027 --> 00:20:42,589
Just go!

349
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:43,509
What deal?

350
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,671
Move!

351
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,272
Aunt! Wait!

352
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:51,477
Although Seong Chun-hyang was

353
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:53,840
of humble birth,

354
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:01,327
you must all follow her
example of chastity and fidelity.

355
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:02,609
Understood?

356
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:03,730
Yes, ma'am.

357
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,773
Madam Nam? Step forward.

358
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:12,538
It's a silver knife

359
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:13,740
to honor your patience and chastity.

360
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,742
Remain faithful as a
widow for a few more years,

361
00:21:15,862 --> 00:21:18,625
and you'll be named a virtuous woman.

362
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,187
Continue remaining strong

363
00:21:21,307 --> 00:21:22,909
for a few more years.

364
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:23,990
Yes, ma'am.

365
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:30,917
"It's a silver knife"

366
00:21:31,037 --> 00:21:32,879
"to honor your patience and chastity."

367
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,321
What honor?

368
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:36,843
What good is this?

369
00:21:37,523 --> 00:21:41,327
It's to stab your thigh and be patient.

370
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:43,409
Be glad it's not a kitchen knife.

371
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,893
At least Chun-hyang
had a husband to wait for.

372
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:48,534
How long must I wait

373
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:49,576
for my dead husband?

374
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,818
- You'll meet him after death.
- Goodness!

375
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:52,899
Madam Yoon.

376
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,863
May I see your silver knife?

377
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:01,507
Ah... I don't have one.

378
00:22:01,628 --> 00:22:04,631
What? Why not?

379
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:07,073
I lost it.

380
00:22:07,914 --> 00:22:10,917
How can you lose
the symbol of chastity?

381
00:22:11,037 --> 00:22:12,358
I can't believe you!

382
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:15,121
Something smells fishy.

383
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:17,644
What do you mean?

384
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:20,607
Wait! She's wearing makeup!

385
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:21,968
Oh, dear!

386
00:22:22,088 --> 00:22:22,889
Are you...

387
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,852
- I have to report you.
- Wait!

388
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:29,495
Please!

389
00:22:30,657 --> 00:22:31,778
Then spill it.

390
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:36,102
Is he a pimp?

391
00:22:36,382 --> 00:22:38,905
No. He's a gibang bachelor.

392
00:22:39,946 --> 00:22:43,549
A different woman from
last night has come?

393
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,752
Yes. She asked for Heo Sek.

394
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,361
What?

395
00:22:56,482 --> 00:22:58,685
Where did they go?

396
00:22:59,165 --> 00:23:04,050
They couldn't have escaped
from here without breaking the door.

397
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:07,013
- But...
- Did they use magic?

398
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:10,136
Catch the sacs!

399
00:23:10,897 --> 00:23:13,059
Come out of the sac!

400
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:16,182
My apologies.

401
00:23:17,824 --> 00:23:21,427
I should've become one with the sac.

402
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,751
How frustrating!

403
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:27,433
How could my tactics fail?

404
00:23:28,955 --> 00:23:30,917
I won't fail a second time.

405
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:34,681
Why do women keep coming to the gibang?

406
00:23:35,602 --> 00:23:37,443
So?

407
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:39,205
Will you go in again?

408
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:42,168
Not for free.

409
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,774
Fine. I'll let you out.

410
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:49,576
How could I trust you?

411
00:23:50,056 --> 00:23:52,298
Promise me you'll let me out

412
00:23:52,418 --> 00:23:54,100
as well as stop meddling with my life.

413
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,782
In writing, of course.

414
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:58,544
- Then I'll go in.
- Why you!

415
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:02,388
Well, well! It's not
so bad living here!

416
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,070
Just give me a potty!

417
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:05,912
Fine.

418
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,116
If you're so desperate,

419
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,238
I'll go instead...

420
00:24:16,002 --> 00:24:18,124
How much do you have to pay back?

421
00:24:18,484 --> 00:24:20,887
Should the girls and I sell our jewels?

422
00:24:24,811 --> 00:24:26,492
If we lose the gibang,

423
00:24:26,613 --> 00:24:29,175
we'll be sold off as street girls.

424
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:36,022
Madam Aunt!

425
00:24:36,422 --> 00:24:37,864
I'm coming in!

426
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:41,628
Why are we here?

427
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,191
It's hard to be the breadwinner.

428
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:46,873
Have a seat.

429
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,197
I came to discuss something.

430
00:24:51,718 --> 00:24:53,399
I suddenly had this great idea!

431
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,682
- Go away!
- Aunt.

432
00:24:56,002 --> 00:24:57,724
Why don't we make

433
00:24:57,844 --> 00:24:59,726
a business out of this?

434
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,648
Business? What business?

435
00:25:05,411 --> 00:25:06,412
Women...

436
00:25:07,854 --> 00:25:09,255
Let's take them as guests

437
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,098
and make some money!

438
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,379
What?

439
00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:17,944
I'm saying, I'll be a gisaeng.

440
00:25:18,464 --> 00:25:21,387
A man with balls can't be a gisaeng!

441
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:23,429
What's so special about balls?

442
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,271
He's right.

443
00:25:26,072 --> 00:25:27,353
Not only I can play instruments,

444
00:25:27,473 --> 00:25:30,957
but I'm also gifted in
poetry, writing, and drawing.

445
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:33,359
I know all the gibang rules,

446
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,081
so I'm fit to be a gisaeng.

447
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:40,046
Most of all, my way with women...

448
00:25:41,087 --> 00:25:44,050
I don't have to give details.

449
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,133
Did you memorize that?

450
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:49,095
No. How could a man...

451
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,498
I saw a loan shark come by here.

452
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:56,062
I'll just take 20% of my sales.

453
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:00,987
No way.

454
00:26:01,748 --> 00:26:02,989
- 10%.
- 15%.

455
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:04,270
Deal!

456
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:06,112
What am I doing?

457
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,915
Then let's start marketing.

458
00:26:09,195 --> 00:26:10,276
Marketing?

459
00:26:10,877 --> 00:26:14,400
The key to business is good marketing.

460
00:26:15,121 --> 00:26:16,963
We must let the women know.

461
00:26:17,764 --> 00:26:19,927
How about using him as a tout?

462
00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:22,049
He looks like a beggar.

463
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:23,811
No one will suspect him.

464
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:26,213
What? A beggar?

465
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:29,136
Right! He looks like a beggar!

466
00:26:29,937 --> 00:26:31,138
Good idea!

467
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:33,821
What? Are you two serious?

468
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:36,864
No, it's not a good idea!

469
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:42,109
Though I may live humbly
because I was born in Joseon,

470
00:26:42,229 --> 00:26:44,031
I have the blood of
Goryeo's royal family

471
00:26:44,151 --> 00:26:45,913
flowing in me!

472
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:48,555
How dare you!

473
00:26:48,796 --> 00:26:50,397
That's preposterous!

474
00:26:51,118 --> 00:26:53,400
I won't force you to anything.

475
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:55,362
Gap-deok?

476
00:26:56,043 --> 00:26:56,884
You'll regret it.

477
00:26:57,004 --> 00:26:59,166
You lowly fools.

478
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:00,447
Hand him over to the authorities

479
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:02,570
- for dining and dashing!
- Yes, ma'am.

480
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,891
Fool!

481
00:27:04,011 --> 00:27:07,975
How dare you touch a royal...

482
00:27:27,915 --> 00:27:29,556
Get lost, beggars!

483
00:27:30,197 --> 00:27:31,839
He's a beggar!

484
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:33,160
Beggar!

485
00:27:56,904 --> 00:27:59,346
The beggar king!

486
00:27:59,907 --> 00:28:02,389
No! I'm a king's descendant!

487
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,352
Dismiss!

488
00:28:11,238 --> 00:28:13,560
Beautiful flowers bloom.

489
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:17,044
Know the way of pioneers?

490
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,327
Find the secret,

491
00:28:21,048 --> 00:28:23,330
and you'll be rewarded.

492
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:27,454
It is not nonsense.

493
00:28:28,055 --> 00:28:31,178
Explore at will.

494
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,223
You'll be enlightened.

495
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:43,390
Read it right to left.

496
00:28:45,232 --> 00:28:48,475
<i>Beautiful bachelor available</i>

497
00:29:01,248 --> 00:29:02,690
My name is Heo Sek.

498
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:20,588
What is it?

499
00:29:21,108 --> 00:29:23,190
May I offer you a drink?

500
00:29:36,283 --> 00:29:37,244
Allow me.

501
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:47,134
Please don't keep
my pretty hand waiting.

502
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,305
If we can meet outside,

503
00:29:58,425 --> 00:30:01,308
we can eat more delicious dishes.

504
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,353
To me, what I eat and
where I eat don't matter.

505
00:30:07,034 --> 00:30:09,436
Whom I eat with is what matters.

506
00:30:10,998 --> 00:30:12,199
Mr. Heo...

507
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,123
It is done.

508
00:30:17,605 --> 00:30:18,766
It's pretty!

509
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:22,369
But is it really me?

510
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:27,895
A portrait must be embellished.

511
00:30:28,015 --> 00:30:28,976
Mr. Heo!

512
00:30:37,745 --> 00:30:40,187
I want to see you even in my dreams.

513
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:44,511
Please stop.

514
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:46,153
You won't meet me there.

515
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:47,755
Why?

516
00:30:51,238 --> 00:30:52,559
Then because of me,

517
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,443
you won't sleep a wink.

518
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,686
Oh, dear!

519
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:00,688
Lowly fools!

520
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,172
Why am I helping that fool?

521
00:31:08,415 --> 00:31:10,417
Your Majesty!

522
00:31:35,803 --> 00:31:37,444
Oh, a beggar!

523
00:31:39,086 --> 00:31:42,730
Beggar! The beggar king!

524
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,412
Stop calling me that!

525
00:31:45,532 --> 00:31:46,654
The beggar king!

526
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:48,335
You got the wrong man.

527
00:31:53,581 --> 00:31:56,744
I don't think I've done much

528
00:31:56,864 --> 00:31:59,186
as an older brother to you girls.

529
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,149
Sek!

530
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:05,192
Take whatever you want!

531
00:32:10,437 --> 00:32:13,881
You're spending money like crazy.

532
00:32:14,241 --> 00:32:16,523
Aunt and those girls are

533
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:18,445
the only family I have.

534
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:22,770
I didn't know they'd be so happy.

535
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,451
I should've done this for them sooner.

536
00:32:26,894 --> 00:32:29,777
Family is nice.

537
00:32:29,897 --> 00:32:32,219
Sek. Can I have this?

538
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:36,503
Why would a little girl
need a wedding hairpin?

539
00:32:37,544 --> 00:32:40,227
I'll use it when I get married.

540
00:32:40,347 --> 00:32:41,749
You're too young for that.

541
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,512
I was going to get married to you.

542
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,554
But you're family, right?

543
00:32:48,195 --> 00:32:50,517
I'll marry someone
more handsome than you.

544
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:06,173
- Not again.
- Oh, please. Let's go.

545
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:08,696
Get that one?

546
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:12,700
That one! A bit higher!

547
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,941
Be patient.

548
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:18,345
- Mother, please!
- Wait.

549
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,830
Not again.

550
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,272
It's not that.

551
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,359
A little to the right!

552
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,083
Please give me that.

553
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:43,330
My lady, allow me to get it for you.

554
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:45,973
No thank you, sir.

555
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:51,058
I'll get them. Allow me.

556
00:33:51,178 --> 00:33:52,700
I said it's okay...

557
00:33:53,861 --> 00:33:54,822
Very well.

558
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,033
Come, Deok-se!

559
00:34:08,515 --> 00:34:09,476
Deok-se!

560
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:11,919
Come here at once.

561
00:34:16,644 --> 00:34:19,086
Yes, you! Deok-se.

562
00:34:21,448 --> 00:34:23,530
My servant will get it for you.

563
00:34:23,651 --> 00:34:25,813
Damn brat! Why did I
agree to be brothers?

564
00:34:26,894 --> 00:34:28,055
What in the world...

565
00:34:34,461 --> 00:34:35,783
...can I do for you, sir?

566
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:38,305
Pick the persimmons.

567
00:34:38,425 --> 00:34:41,949
Persimmons, sir?

568
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:44,471
Go on. Pick them.

569
00:34:46,393 --> 00:34:49,236
Yes, sir.

570
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,562
Please, just once.

571
00:34:58,926 --> 00:34:59,967
He stinks.

572
00:35:00,648 --> 00:35:01,609
Go on.

573
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:05,212
Hurry up and pick them.

574
00:35:09,697 --> 00:35:10,658
Yes, sir!

575
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:15,422
- Right.
- I'll pick them, sir.

576
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:16,824
- I'm picking them!
- Good job.

577
00:35:16,944 --> 00:35:20,908
I'll pick them all!

578
00:35:21,028 --> 00:35:22,269
We've met before.

579
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:28,475
My name is Heo Sek. And you, my lady?

580
00:35:30,918 --> 00:35:32,559
Ar-soon, let's go.

581
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:37,444
If you won't take this...

582
00:35:37,765 --> 00:35:40,167
At least tell me your name?

583
00:35:40,728 --> 00:35:42,369
I got this for you.

584
00:35:42,489 --> 00:35:44,411
She's Lady Hae-won.

585
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,742
Lady Hae-won.

586
00:35:57,144 --> 00:35:58,505
Deok-se?

587
00:36:01,548 --> 00:36:05,552
I'm sorry, but you fit the role.

588
00:36:05,953 --> 00:36:07,715
What role?

589
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:10,197
Just think of it as
helping your little brother.

590
00:36:10,317 --> 00:36:11,919
You made me be a beggar,

591
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,480
and now I'm your servant?

592
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:15,082
How can you use me?

593
00:36:16,323 --> 00:36:17,925
- What?
- What?

594
00:36:18,165 --> 00:36:19,126
What?

595
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,412
Come here, or we're through!

596
00:36:27,334 --> 00:36:30,658
Deok-se! Hurry, lad!

597
00:36:36,423 --> 00:36:37,384
Oh, right.

598
00:36:38,185 --> 00:36:41,108
The guest in the Orchid
Room has been waiting long.

599
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:51,078
Oh my!

600
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:53,841
What?

601
00:36:55,122 --> 00:36:56,644
Foolish lad.

602
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:58,966
What? Those are my clothes!

603
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,813
You put makeup on, too?

604
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:08,936
You disrespect me so much.

605
00:37:09,376 --> 00:37:11,579
So I dressed up

606
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:13,020
to prove I'm of royal descent.

607
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:20,067
What damn royal descent?

608
00:37:20,387 --> 00:37:22,389
You punk!

609
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,431
What?

610
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:28,235
What's your secret?

611
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,438
Tell me your secret!

612
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:33,641
What secret?

613
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:37,044
The secret to cajoling women.

614
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:40,888
It's not cajoling. It's communicating.

615
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,650
Get that through your head!

616
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,852
Of course!

617
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:48,455
So what's your secret to

618
00:37:48,576 --> 00:37:51,699
communicating with women?

619
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,182
By chance, is yours...

620
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:58,586
big?

621
00:37:58,706 --> 00:38:01,508
Men are so foolish.

622
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:03,671
You're a man, too!

623
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:04,752
Then what is it?

624
00:38:17,324 --> 00:38:18,886
- Nothing!
- Damn!

625
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:22,409
Fine! Keep your secret and
have all the girls to yourself!

626
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:24,051
Greedy pig!

627
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:26,053
No secret, huh?

628
00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:28,095
Communicating? Like hell!

629
00:38:28,215 --> 00:38:30,537
You must've had a secret!

630
00:38:30,658 --> 00:38:33,701
Maybe you slept with them?

631
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,022
No.

632
00:38:35,623 --> 00:38:38,986
They didn't seek me out of lust

633
00:38:39,106 --> 00:38:42,229
or for my sweet talk.

634
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,872
I want to leave here.

635
00:38:46,153 --> 00:38:49,597
I want to see the world

636
00:38:49,717 --> 00:38:52,439
and meet many people.

637
00:38:56,844 --> 00:39:00,808
But I'll just grow old here

638
00:39:00,928 --> 00:39:03,490
like a withering tree.

639
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:07,054
But you're so beautiful...

640
00:39:07,454 --> 00:39:10,457
No need to say such sweet things.

641
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:19,146
Will you just listen?

642
00:39:21,629 --> 00:39:23,350
Just listen to me.

643
00:39:26,153 --> 00:39:29,116
I always listened.

644
00:39:30,397 --> 00:39:32,680
All I did was look into their eyes

645
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,724
and listen to them every night.

646
00:39:39,566 --> 00:39:41,729
Did you love them?

647
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,932
I've never been in love.

648
00:39:47,014 --> 00:39:49,336
That's my fate.

649
00:39:49,937 --> 00:39:53,380
I'm not worthy to love anyone.

650
00:39:54,381 --> 00:39:55,823
Not even one woman?

651
00:39:56,183 --> 00:39:59,106
What a great son!

652
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:02,149
She must be happy to
see her son as a gisaeng!

653
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:03,751
How can you say that?

654
00:40:03,991 --> 00:40:06,393
- You know I'm right.
- What?

655
00:40:07,314 --> 00:40:09,116
You won't even tell me your secret.

656
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,240
What?

657
00:40:13,681 --> 00:40:15,763
Persimmons?

658
00:40:16,403 --> 00:40:17,965
Lady Hae-won.

659
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,613
Brother! Change into Deok-se.

660
00:40:27,374 --> 00:40:29,617
Jeez! Not again!

661
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:36,303
I can't tell you apart

662
00:40:36,423 --> 00:40:37,905
from the flowers.

663
00:40:43,671 --> 00:40:44,672
Do you remember me?

664
00:40:45,673 --> 00:40:46,674
I'm Heo Sek.

665
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:49,877
Hello, sir.

666
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,159
A flower talks?

667
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:55,202
Oh, please...

668
00:40:57,404 --> 00:40:59,286
Chance meeting twice is a coincidence.

669
00:40:59,406 --> 00:41:01,408
Three times, it's fate.

670
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:06,093
How about a friendly chat
over an aromatic cup of tea?

671
00:41:07,374 --> 00:41:08,335
Hae-won!

672
00:41:08,976 --> 00:41:09,937
Sir.

673
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:15,222
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

674
00:41:16,103 --> 00:41:18,305
He did me a favor once before.

675
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:19,747
What favor?

676
00:41:19,867 --> 00:41:21,148
Why didn't you ask me?

677
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,712
I'm Yu-sang, the second
son of the Minister of Justice,

678
00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:25,873
Lee Si-young.

679
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,474
Who are you?

680
00:41:28,996 --> 00:41:32,319
I'm Sek, the only son of

681
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:35,803
the respectable Heo family over there!

682
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:38,806
As you don't mention
your father's name,

683
00:41:38,926 --> 00:41:41,288
your family must not
be very respectable.

684
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:43,330
It is!

685
00:41:46,093 --> 00:41:49,376
I've asked the chief monk
to take special care of you.

686
00:41:49,617 --> 00:41:51,458
You should be comfortable here.

687
00:41:51,739 --> 00:41:53,140
Thank you, sir.

688
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:55,182
Are you all right?

689
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:57,785
I can send you more maids.

690
00:41:58,025 --> 00:42:01,068
- No. I'm fine.
- You sure?

691
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:02,790
I'd better go.

692
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,271
You're still here?

693
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,642
He even walks frivolously.

694
00:42:14,762 --> 00:42:18,085
Chirp! Chirp! Chirp!

695
00:42:18,686 --> 00:42:20,527
What's that noise?

696
00:42:20,968 --> 00:42:24,531
You got the bird from him! I
never knew I'd live to see this.

697
00:42:24,652 --> 00:42:25,613
What?

698
00:42:26,213 --> 00:42:27,775
I did not get the bird!

699
00:42:27,895 --> 00:42:31,138
I wonder what kind of bird it was.

700
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:33,981
A dog got the bird while
chasing after a chicken...

701
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:35,382
So you're a dog bird!

702
00:42:35,502 --> 00:42:38,265
- A dog bird!
- What?

703
00:42:38,385 --> 00:42:39,787
Move!

704
00:42:40,748 --> 00:42:41,869
Ouch!

705
00:42:46,553 --> 00:42:48,115
He looks so classy and rich.

706
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:51,238
You are a classy guy too,

707
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:53,681
but you stand no chance against him.

708
00:42:54,121 --> 00:42:56,644
You're a gibang bachelor.

709
00:42:58,525 --> 00:43:00,528
Chirp! Chirp! Chirp!

710
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,651
Stop it!

711
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:03,892
Chirp!

712
00:43:13,862 --> 00:43:17,345
Thought you were a bag of
wind, but you're pretty strong.

713
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:21,429
A flower talks?

714
00:43:26,955 --> 00:43:27,996
Look, Nan-seol.

715
00:43:28,637 --> 00:43:31,199
How about a friendly chat

716
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:35,764
over an aromatic glass of rice wine?

717
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,565
Cut the crap!

718
00:43:39,728 --> 00:43:43,131
If you've got too much
energy, go scoop the dung!

719
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:44,292
Dung?

720
00:43:44,412 --> 00:43:45,574
I'm not your slave!

721
00:43:46,655 --> 00:43:47,495
What?

722
00:43:47,616 --> 00:43:50,178
How can you throw dung
on a man's words like that?

723
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:52,260
And show some respect!

724
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,302
You're younger than me, woman!

725
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:56,064
You crazy fool!

726
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,466
You should be thankful

727
00:43:58,587 --> 00:43:59,988
that I'm not kicking you out!

728
00:44:00,709 --> 00:44:01,950
Younger?

729
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:06,154
What makes you think
I'm younger than you?

730
00:44:08,997 --> 00:44:12,000
Because you look young!

731
00:44:13,561 --> 00:44:15,443
You look very young!

732
00:44:17,606 --> 00:44:20,248
I look young?

733
00:44:23,491 --> 00:44:25,373
What good is being pretty

734
00:44:25,493 --> 00:44:27,495
with all that makeup?

735
00:44:28,136 --> 00:44:30,018
A kind heart is what counts!

736
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:32,621
My kindhearted brother!

737
00:44:33,261 --> 00:44:34,863
Follow me!

738
00:44:34,983 --> 00:44:36,825
What is it this time?

739
00:44:39,628 --> 00:44:41,029
Where are you going?

740
00:44:42,631 --> 00:44:45,834
Lady! Look.

741
00:45:07,055 --> 00:45:09,337
Another coincidence?

742
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,540
Cool horse!

743
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:13,662
Isn't it?

744
00:45:15,063 --> 00:45:17,666
A man should ride a horse.

745
00:45:18,066 --> 00:45:20,068
I see fools riding palanquins

746
00:45:20,188 --> 00:45:22,190
like elderly men.

747
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:23,872
What a laugh!

748
00:45:24,753 --> 00:45:26,875
What brings you here today, sir?

749
00:45:27,115 --> 00:45:28,076
What?

750
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,122
Oh, why did I come?

751
00:45:34,242 --> 00:45:38,326
What else? You came
to see the lady, sir.

752
00:45:38,446 --> 00:45:41,089
With me, your servant.

753
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:42,971
I did not.

754
00:45:43,091 --> 00:45:45,053
What?

755
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,375
Just act like how you usually act.

756
00:45:48,777 --> 00:45:49,898
Sir.

757
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,742
What? Please ignore him.

758
00:45:53,862 --> 00:45:55,103
What is its name?

759
00:45:56,865 --> 00:45:59,588
Its name is Maniac.

760
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:01,750
Heo Sek's Maniac.

761
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:03,792
Why you!

762
00:46:03,912 --> 00:46:06,955
Sek's Maniac!

763
00:46:07,355 --> 00:46:09,557
Mister, can I ride it?

764
00:46:09,678 --> 00:46:11,279
No. For what?

765
00:46:18,286 --> 00:46:19,688
Let's go!

766
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:23,291
Ar-soon!

767
00:46:24,132 --> 00:46:25,093
Sorry.

768
00:46:40,789 --> 00:46:43,752
Say, ah.

769
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:48,997
What are you doing?

770
00:46:50,759 --> 00:46:53,121
Oh my! It's just a habit.

771
00:46:53,241 --> 00:46:54,202
A habit?

772
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,004
No way!

773
00:46:56,124 --> 00:46:58,647
The tea might be bitter.

774
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:00,288
So I brought some cake...

775
00:47:00,408 --> 00:47:01,249
Foolish hand!

776
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:02,370
What are you doing?

777
00:47:02,731 --> 00:47:05,974
My hand...

778
00:47:12,821 --> 00:47:17,425
Why are you staying here at a temple?

779
00:47:17,545 --> 00:47:20,548
I'm praying for my older brother
to pass the state examination.

780
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:22,591
I see.

781
00:47:24,192 --> 00:47:25,433
By the way,

782
00:47:25,553 --> 00:47:27,195
that bastard I saw before...

783
00:47:27,996 --> 00:47:30,799
Who might he be?

784
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:33,361
Oh, are you talking about Mr. Yu-sang?

785
00:47:33,481 --> 00:47:35,163
Are you betrothed to him?

786
00:47:35,283 --> 00:47:36,284
No.

787
00:47:37,205 --> 00:47:39,688
He's just my brother's best friend.

788
00:47:39,808 --> 00:47:40,809
Of course!

789
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:42,651
I knew it.

790
00:47:46,094 --> 00:47:48,136
Still, be mindful of him.

791
00:47:48,617 --> 00:47:51,539
The way he looks at you is treacherous.

792
00:47:53,461 --> 00:47:54,823
It can't be...

793
00:47:55,263 --> 00:47:58,346
He treated me like a
sister since I was young.

794
00:47:58,827 --> 00:48:02,510
He's classy and gentle.

795
00:48:03,832 --> 00:48:05,433
And he's a great scholar.

796
00:48:07,235 --> 00:48:09,477
Why is your mouth...

797
00:48:11,279 --> 00:48:12,240
What about me?

798
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:14,282
Sir?

799
00:48:14,803 --> 00:48:17,405
What kind of man do I look like?

800
00:48:18,246 --> 00:48:19,608
For instance...

801
00:48:19,728 --> 00:48:24,933
Judging from my classy and
elegant appearance, I must be...

802
00:48:25,053 --> 00:48:27,576
- A fraud, right?
- A fraud.

803
00:48:28,056 --> 00:48:30,859
What? No way!

804
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:33,341
I'm not a fraud.

805
00:48:33,461 --> 00:48:35,303
It's time to pray, my lady.

806
00:48:37,105 --> 00:48:37,946
I must go.

807
00:48:38,066 --> 00:48:39,507
Wait! Please...

808
00:48:39,628 --> 00:48:41,429
- Doesn't he look like a fraud?
- Must you pray today?

809
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:43,872
Please stay a little longer...

810
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,717
You don't look like a fraud.

811
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:50,919
However...

812
00:48:51,439 --> 00:48:52,400
However?

813
00:48:54,122 --> 00:48:55,123
However...

814
00:48:55,443 --> 00:48:57,926
Lady Hae-won!

815
00:48:58,366 --> 00:48:59,247
However, what?

816
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:01,169
It'll drive you crazy!

817
00:49:01,289 --> 00:49:03,572
Throwing bait at you like that.

818
00:49:03,692 --> 00:49:06,975
However... Wow!

819
00:49:08,697 --> 00:49:11,419
Mr. Dong-ju! It's me, Ar-soon.

820
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:16,625
There is heaven above and earth below.

821
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:32,520
There is heaven above and earth below.

822
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:37,766
Earth below...

823
00:49:37,886 --> 00:49:39,567
There is heaven above and earth below.

824
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:41,930
Mankind and all things are
between heaven and earth.

825
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:44,172
The sun, moon, and
stars are in the sky.

826
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:46,134
Rivers, seas, mountains
are supported by the land!

827
00:49:47,936 --> 00:49:50,258
Ar-soon? How did you know?

828
00:49:50,538 --> 00:49:53,341
Even a slave girl like me
learned it from listening to you!

829
00:49:53,622 --> 00:49:56,464
Why can't you memorize
that for more than 10 years?

830
00:49:58,186 --> 00:49:59,908
You're better than me.

831
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:02,711
If I had been as clever as you,

832
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:04,472
I would've passed the examination.

833
00:50:05,353 --> 00:50:08,196
Let's see. I'll memorize the
"Thousand-Character Classic."

834
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:12,160
Sky "Chun." Land "Ji"...

835
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,442
Poor Lady Hae-won.

836
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:18,366
All that work for a hopeless brother!

837
00:50:18,607 --> 00:50:19,608
Black "Hyun"...

838
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:21,690
Yellow "Hwang"!

839
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:24,172
Right! Yellow "Hwang"!

840
00:50:27,215 --> 00:50:30,579
- Sky "Chun"...
- Dong-ju! Are you inside?

841
00:50:38,346 --> 00:50:40,629
Why aren't you eating? Have some.

842
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,955
Can you study in a place like this?

843
00:50:49,517 --> 00:50:52,961
A lighter does not blame the brush.

844
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:55,283
I'm fine.

845
00:50:58,526 --> 00:51:02,811
It's not lighter, but writer.

846
00:51:04,412 --> 00:51:06,975
Ah, writer.

847
00:51:13,662 --> 00:51:15,904
How long will you
leave Hae-won like that?

848
00:51:16,585 --> 00:51:20,308
She's late in getting married
because she's been supporting you.

849
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:24,833
I feel ashamed.

850
00:51:28,356 --> 00:51:31,840
Give your sister to me.

851
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,443
I must marry her as soon as I can.

852
00:51:37,285 --> 00:51:38,687
She likes me.

853
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:40,689
She likes me not.

854
00:51:41,489 --> 00:51:42,691
She likes me.

855
00:51:42,971 --> 00:51:43,972
Not working out for you?

856
00:51:48,376 --> 00:51:51,459
The one who falls in love first

857
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:54,703
has the lower hand in a relationship.

858
00:51:56,585 --> 00:51:58,827
You're teaching me about love?

859
00:51:58,947 --> 00:52:01,549
Brother, have you ever dated?

860
00:52:03,511 --> 00:52:05,714
Over a thousand times.

861
00:52:06,274 --> 00:52:07,796
A thousand?

862
00:52:08,637 --> 00:52:11,720
Through books and imagination.

863
00:52:13,281 --> 00:52:15,203
Being a virgin at my age,

864
00:52:15,323 --> 00:52:17,806
I'm an expert in love's theory.

865
00:52:18,366 --> 00:52:21,049
You could say I've
achieved enlightenment.

866
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:25,453
But are you serious?

867
00:52:26,054 --> 00:52:27,015
About what?

868
00:52:28,296 --> 00:52:31,820
Your feelings for Lady
Hae-won. Are you serious?

869
00:52:33,822 --> 00:52:37,105
If you are, then give her your heart.

870
00:52:37,706 --> 00:52:39,708
Not your mouth.

871
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:45,513
I'll be Deok-se all you want.

872
00:52:46,314 --> 00:52:49,998
I can't believe I'm Deok-se!

873
00:53:03,652 --> 00:53:06,014
You look as if you live here.

874
00:53:06,134 --> 00:53:08,737
What? No...

875
00:53:16,144 --> 00:53:17,105
Look.

876
00:53:18,146 --> 00:53:19,868
I'm warning you.

877
00:53:20,709 --> 00:53:22,550
Stop roaming around Hae-won.

878
00:53:24,633 --> 00:53:27,515
I've never done such a thing.

879
00:53:28,116 --> 00:53:30,719
She keeps showing up in front of me.

880
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,521
It must be destiny.

881
00:53:34,683 --> 00:53:36,044
You met Hae-won again?

882
00:53:36,164 --> 00:53:39,087
Yes, I met her recently. Alone.

883
00:53:41,329 --> 00:53:44,052
I'll be watching you.

884
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:55,183
Rotten bastard.

885
00:54:00,428 --> 00:54:03,151
Sek! You're wanted in Room 1.

886
00:54:03,672 --> 00:54:05,113
I'll be back soon.

887
00:54:05,353 --> 00:54:07,756
But you just got here.

888
00:54:07,876 --> 00:54:10,278
How many guests do you have?

889
00:54:10,398 --> 00:54:12,080
Others are waiting.

890
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,882
I'll return soon.

891
00:54:17,806 --> 00:54:18,767
Already?

892
00:54:18,887 --> 00:54:21,209
So many guests came at once.

893
00:54:27,415 --> 00:54:28,376
I'll have them together.

894
00:54:28,657 --> 00:54:30,178
Together?

895
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:37,505
I'm very sorry to keep you waiting.

896
00:54:37,626 --> 00:54:40,749
Thank you so much
for your understanding.

897
00:54:44,873 --> 00:54:46,434
This way, please.

898
00:54:55,844 --> 00:54:56,845
Mom!

899
00:54:56,965 --> 00:54:59,848
- She's her daughter?
- Oh my!

900
00:55:00,128 --> 00:55:01,489
You brat...

901
00:55:06,534 --> 00:55:08,136
- Madam!
- If I catch you, you're dead!

902
00:55:08,256 --> 00:55:09,497
One of us will die tonight!

903
00:55:09,618 --> 00:55:11,139
Ma'am! Stop!

904
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,663
Family feuds are fun to watch.

905
00:55:15,864 --> 00:55:17,345
That family is a mess...

906
00:55:20,909 --> 00:55:22,550
Your father has 3 concubines.

907
00:55:23,672 --> 00:55:27,916
He left with the youngest
one over two months ago

908
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:29,798
and lives with her.

909
00:55:30,438 --> 00:55:33,882
How do you think I feel?

910
00:55:34,322 --> 00:55:37,525
So I came here this once
for a breath of fresh air.

911
00:55:37,886 --> 00:55:39,848
It's my first time here.

912
00:55:39,968 --> 00:55:40,769
But we met in the bathroom...

913
00:55:40,889 --> 00:55:42,050
Shut up!

914
00:55:42,931 --> 00:55:43,892
What about you?

915
00:55:44,573 --> 00:55:47,696
A virtuous woman must...

916
00:55:48,496 --> 00:55:51,059
How could you come
to a place like this?

917
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:55,704
What is wrong with coming here?

918
00:55:56,985 --> 00:56:00,268
Men drink and enjoy the arts
in places like this night and day.

919
00:56:00,589 --> 00:56:03,471
You ladies are just here
to drown your troubles.

920
00:56:03,592 --> 00:56:06,154
How is that reproachable?

921
00:56:06,715 --> 00:56:09,557
He's right!

922
00:56:10,118 --> 00:56:11,079
Now.

923
00:56:13,521 --> 00:56:17,325
I, the gisaeng, shall entertain you.

924
00:56:40,268 --> 00:56:41,309
Welcome.

925
00:56:41,429 --> 00:56:42,671
Welcome back.

926
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:43,752
Welcome.

927
00:56:43,872 --> 00:56:44,833
Wait.

928
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:48,677
One new guest!

929
00:56:48,957 --> 00:56:50,318
Is it your first time here?

930
00:56:59,327 --> 00:57:00,609
Dad isn't back yet?

931
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:04,012
I just hope he croaks.

932
00:57:07,776 --> 00:57:09,337
No blessing of a husband,

933
00:57:09,457 --> 00:57:10,779
but you have a good son.

934
00:57:10,899 --> 00:57:11,900
It's a daughter.

935
00:57:13,381 --> 00:57:14,703
Daughter?

936
00:57:18,386 --> 00:57:22,470
I see your daughter
must get married soon!

937
00:57:22,591 --> 00:57:23,912
Marry her off next year.

938
00:57:24,032 --> 00:57:25,113
She's not even a year old.

939
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,996
Right! That's way too early!

940
00:57:34,763 --> 00:57:36,404
This was made in South Manchuria.

941
00:57:36,524 --> 00:57:39,487
See how the pearls twinkle?

942
00:57:43,411 --> 00:57:45,413
Good to see you!

943
00:58:13,802 --> 00:58:16,044
Who's here before breakfast?

944
00:58:17,245 --> 00:58:20,088
What? Repeat what you said.

945
00:58:21,129 --> 00:58:23,011
We know everything.

946
00:58:23,131 --> 00:58:26,855
We heard men can be gisaengs here.

947
00:58:42,871 --> 00:58:44,272
Who are those fools?

948
00:58:45,473 --> 00:58:46,875
- They're trainees.
- What?

949
00:58:46,995 --> 00:58:48,797
They're the new trainees.

950
00:58:49,678 --> 00:58:50,719
Your juniors.

951
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:56,725
Aunt is crazy over money!

952
00:59:02,651 --> 00:59:04,693
Little brother,

953
00:59:04,813 --> 00:59:06,414
what are you drawing?

954
00:59:10,498 --> 00:59:13,702
It's not Ae-OK.

955
00:59:14,182 --> 00:59:17,065
It's not Choon-boon.

956
00:59:17,826 --> 00:59:18,947
It's not me, either.

957
00:59:19,387 --> 00:59:21,269
I didn't ask you.

958
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:22,911
It's Lady Hae-won.

959
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:27,716
I'm gifted in drawing portraits.

960
00:59:28,597 --> 00:59:30,358
But why can't I draw her?

961
00:59:33,081 --> 00:59:34,282
Wait!

962
00:59:36,404 --> 00:59:39,447
Does it mean that her beauty is

963
00:59:39,567 --> 00:59:42,131
too great to be captured
on a mere piece of paper?

964
00:59:43,532 --> 00:59:47,016
Yes! That must be it!

965
00:59:47,336 --> 00:59:48,898
Don't try so hard, fool!

966
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,061
Sek!

967
00:59:53,903 --> 00:59:56,505
Sook-jung! Why bathe so frequently?

968
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:59,108
You'll lose all your skin.

969
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:01,791
So pretty.

970
01:00:01,911 --> 01:00:02,872
Sek.

971
01:00:03,753 --> 01:00:04,914
I'll become a woman tonight.

972
01:00:06,355 --> 01:00:07,316
What?

973
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:11,641
How much did you get?

974
01:00:11,761 --> 01:00:14,163
I'll pay you! Leave Sook-jung be!

975
01:00:15,444 --> 01:00:17,927
She played a big part.

976
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,369
Sook-jung saved our gibang.

977
01:00:22,451 --> 01:00:25,054
Aunt! She's just seventeen!

978
01:00:25,174 --> 01:00:27,536
I was fifteen.

979
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:28,658
It's just her turn.

980
01:00:28,778 --> 01:00:31,340
How can she be sold off to a man

981
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:32,942
she doesn't even know?

982
01:00:36,946 --> 01:00:38,988
Sook-jung made the choice.

983
01:00:39,548 --> 01:00:42,231
Rather than serve many guests,

984
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:45,955
she wanted to serve one man.

985
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:48,157
She asked me.

986
01:00:49,959 --> 01:00:52,361
I hope her husband will

987
01:00:52,481 --> 01:00:54,684
love her dearly.

988
01:00:55,404 --> 01:00:58,487
Sir? May she come in?

989
01:01:24,073 --> 01:01:29,318
Love is so crude.

990
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:37,446
Why can't Mr. Heo come here?

991
01:01:37,847 --> 01:01:39,729
He's not feeling well.

992
01:01:39,849 --> 01:01:40,730
Shut up!

993
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:42,051
I didn't ask you!

994
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:44,253
Bring him here at once!

995
01:01:44,574 --> 01:01:46,015
Forgive me.

996
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,497
May I show you our new gisaengs?

997
01:01:48,618 --> 01:01:49,619
What?

998
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,062
New gisaengs?

999
01:01:54,824 --> 01:01:55,825
Go on.

1000
01:02:01,871 --> 01:02:03,352
I'm Joong-dae.

1001
01:02:03,472 --> 01:02:05,114
I'm Joong-so.

1002
01:02:23,332 --> 01:02:24,333
Lady.

1003
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,736
Lady Hae-won?

1004
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:31,420
Who's there?

1005
01:02:32,902 --> 01:02:33,863
It's me.

1006
01:02:34,543 --> 01:02:35,464
Heo Sek.

1007
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:36,545
I'll scream.

1008
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:41,190
Scream if you must.

1009
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:43,192
I came with my life on the line.

1010
01:02:45,835 --> 01:02:46,916
Wait!

1011
01:02:47,717 --> 01:02:50,399
If I get hit, I could die.

1012
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,722
You said you're ready to die.

1013
01:02:53,282 --> 01:02:55,164
Were you just bluffing?

1014
01:03:12,181 --> 01:03:13,182
Lady Hae-won.

1015
01:03:14,543 --> 01:03:15,865
Let's go outside.

1016
01:03:17,787 --> 01:03:18,988
How could I...

1017
01:03:19,108 --> 01:03:20,910
Let's go see the moon.

1018
01:03:22,592 --> 01:03:25,955
It's too pretty to watch alone.

1019
01:03:50,299 --> 01:03:53,703
He won't give up.

1020
01:03:54,584 --> 01:03:57,587
I almost peed in bed.

1021
01:04:08,397 --> 01:04:09,398
I'm infatuated.

1022
01:04:12,802 --> 01:04:13,763
Are you serious?

1023
01:04:14,403 --> 01:04:15,364
Yes.

1024
01:04:17,326 --> 01:04:18,287
With persimmons.

1025
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:23,973
Right. Persimmons.

1026
01:04:25,334 --> 01:04:29,138
I loved persimmons as a child.

1027
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:33,422
My brother climbed
trees to get them for me

1028
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:35,585
every autumn.

1029
01:04:37,627 --> 01:04:41,110
The persimmons he picked for me were

1030
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:42,712
so delicious.

1031
01:04:44,994 --> 01:04:48,117
Without thinking,

1032
01:04:48,237 --> 01:04:49,919
I nagged him to pick more for me.

1033
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,884
I nagged a lot, too.

1034
01:04:56,405 --> 01:04:58,848
If only I didn't pester him...

1035
01:05:01,571 --> 01:05:04,734
One day, he fell from a persimmon tree

1036
01:05:04,854 --> 01:05:06,455
and was injured badly.

1037
01:05:06,856 --> 01:05:07,897
Oh...

1038
01:05:08,017 --> 01:05:13,502
Luckily, he survived,

1039
01:05:13,623 --> 01:05:15,024
but he lost his intelligence.

1040
01:05:15,865 --> 01:05:18,988
So many books for someone so dumb!

1041
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:22,511
Even now, the sight of
persimmons scares him.

1042
01:05:23,713 --> 01:05:25,154
Look! See this?

1043
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:29,478
Since then, I've been
devoted to my brother.

1044
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,401
It's all my fault.

1045
01:05:32,521 --> 01:05:34,083
No, it's not your fault.

1046
01:05:35,845 --> 01:05:39,168
Is sacrificing your life

1047
01:05:39,288 --> 01:05:41,330
really for your brother's best?

1048
01:05:42,732 --> 01:05:48,497
Please live for yourself.

1049
01:05:56,305 --> 01:05:58,267
I know now.

1050
01:06:00,269 --> 01:06:03,112
The reason why you seemed
different from other men.

1051
01:06:04,674 --> 01:06:05,795
My looks?

1052
01:06:07,276 --> 01:06:09,078
Not my type.

1053
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:16,205
But you don't seem like a fraud.

1054
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:18,728
However...

1055
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:21,611
What?

1056
01:06:23,252 --> 01:06:24,734
The night is too hot!

1057
01:06:24,854 --> 01:06:25,935
That fool!

1058
01:06:26,576 --> 01:06:27,577
Let's get up.

1059
01:06:33,102 --> 01:06:37,346
The night is too hot and long!

1060
01:06:45,314 --> 01:06:46,676
Lady Hae-won, look over there.

1061
01:06:46,796 --> 01:06:49,999
My body feels so hot!

1062
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,042
It's hot! I'm too hot!

1063
01:06:53,162 --> 01:06:54,563
What is he doing?

1064
01:06:56,365 --> 01:06:58,968
Let's go.

1065
01:06:59,088 --> 01:07:00,409
I'll make sure he keeps his mouth shut.

1066
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,053
It's hot! So hot!

1067
01:07:14,383 --> 01:07:17,466
What are you doing here?

1068
01:07:17,587 --> 01:07:20,109
What brings you here?

1069
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:22,672
Well...

1070
01:07:22,992 --> 01:07:25,795
I came to see the moon.

1071
01:07:26,355 --> 01:07:27,637
By chance,

1072
01:07:29,999 --> 01:07:31,120
are you hot?

1073
01:07:32,161 --> 01:07:35,244
I don't know what you mean.

1074
01:07:35,564 --> 01:07:36,525
Wait.

1075
01:07:44,533 --> 01:07:48,818
What are you doing?

1076
01:07:49,338 --> 01:07:51,380
Help me!

1077
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:58,267
How old are you?

1078
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:02,431
I'm twenty-five.

1079
01:08:08,277 --> 01:08:10,239
Call me Sister.

1080
01:08:36,505 --> 01:08:37,947
However...

1081
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:42,592
You seemed like a little boy

1082
01:08:42,712 --> 01:08:44,233
grumbling out of loneliness.

1083
01:08:45,274 --> 01:08:47,476
Nagging me to stay with you.

1084
01:08:48,277 --> 01:08:49,599
For some reason,

1085
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,682
I didn't mind that.

1086
01:08:56,205 --> 01:08:57,566
Pom rak khun.

1087
01:08:58,688 --> 01:08:59,649
Pardon?

1088
01:09:06,696 --> 01:09:09,338
It means "beautiful."

1089
01:09:11,821 --> 01:09:15,264
A word from a foreign
country in the far south.

1090
01:09:16,025 --> 01:09:17,667
Pom rak khun.

1091
01:09:58,748 --> 01:10:02,271
I wrote a poem about
how I felt that night.

1092
01:10:02,511 --> 01:10:03,633
Would you like to hear it?

1093
01:10:03,753 --> 01:10:04,794
A poem?

1094
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:12,722
Tell me.

1095
01:10:14,964 --> 01:10:18,127
I didn't know you liked me, too.

1096
01:10:18,527 --> 01:10:21,731
What should I do? I'm so happy.

1097
01:10:22,732 --> 01:10:24,574
Thinking it's a dream,

1098
01:10:24,694 --> 01:10:27,456
I keep pinching myself.

1099
01:10:28,377 --> 01:10:29,659
I'm so happy.

1100
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:35,264
I fretted so long,

1101
01:10:35,384 --> 01:10:37,787
thinking you may not like me.

1102
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:44,353
But you like me, too.

1103
01:10:44,714 --> 01:10:45,675
Oh my!

1104
01:10:45,995 --> 01:10:48,197
Tell me one more time.

1105
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:55,404
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me.

1106
01:10:56,365 --> 01:11:00,209
Say you love me and waited for me.

1107
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:06,055
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me.

1108
01:11:06,856 --> 01:11:10,820
Say you need me again.

1109
01:11:15,424 --> 01:11:18,187
You must return before
the monks wake up.

1110
01:11:23,152 --> 01:11:25,995
Then, I'll go first.

1111
01:11:35,605 --> 01:11:37,486
You loved her, right?

1112
01:11:38,047 --> 01:11:40,449
Why do you keep asking?

1113
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:42,812
For some reason,

1114
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:45,214
I wish that you loved her.

1115
01:11:53,222 --> 01:11:55,544
Brother! I've returned.

1116
01:11:55,665 --> 01:11:57,506
Me, too!

1117
01:11:57,627 --> 01:11:58,868
This is it?

1118
01:11:59,829 --> 01:12:02,952
Hae-won! You're back!

1119
01:12:03,072 --> 01:12:06,475
I've never seen an
aristocrat so poor...

1120
01:12:06,596 --> 01:12:07,877
Welcome home.

1121
01:12:08,678 --> 01:12:10,279
Did you study hard?

1122
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:11,921
Of course I did!

1123
01:12:12,041 --> 01:12:13,202
You really studied hard?

1124
01:12:13,322 --> 01:12:14,804
Of course he did.

1125
01:12:14,924 --> 01:12:16,445
It's cold! Let's go inside.

1126
01:12:24,854 --> 01:12:25,975
Brother.

1127
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:27,336
Hmm?

1128
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:32,822
Why don't you quit
studying for the state exam?

1129
01:12:34,704 --> 01:12:37,146
What do you mean?

1130
01:12:38,668 --> 01:12:42,031
It won't be so bad for the 3 of us

1131
01:12:42,151 --> 01:12:45,114
to farm and live like this.

1132
01:12:48,357 --> 01:12:49,318
Hae-won.

1133
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:54,724
I promise I'll pass this time.

1134
01:12:56,165 --> 01:13:01,250
I want to try one more time.

1135
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:18,107
What's with him?

1136
01:13:18,387 --> 01:13:20,630
He must've come to his senses.

1137
01:13:21,711 --> 01:13:24,113
What a relief.

1138
01:13:25,915 --> 01:13:29,038
What about the guests

1139
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:30,519
who come for him?

1140
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,643
Don't worry.

1141
01:13:33,763 --> 01:13:36,525
We have other male
gisaengs to replace him.

1142
01:13:42,892 --> 01:13:44,814
A body of iron!

1143
01:13:44,934 --> 01:13:46,055
Rock, at your service.

1144
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,980
I'm Scholar Kim. I
recently quit college.

1145
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,062
If you'd like to have an
intelligent conversation...

1146
01:13:54,904 --> 01:13:56,505
I'm Bicheollang.

1147
01:13:56,626 --> 01:13:58,868
I'll be your bodyguard forever!

1148
01:13:59,188 --> 01:14:00,630
Come and sit down.

1149
01:14:14,604 --> 01:14:15,845
Stupid fools.

1150
01:14:16,606 --> 01:14:18,247
They'll drink to death.

1151
01:14:22,652 --> 01:14:23,613
Aunt!

1152
01:14:24,253 --> 01:14:26,576
Do you want me to study or not?

1153
01:14:27,617 --> 01:14:31,741
How do you expect me to
study in such conditions?

1154
01:14:32,622 --> 01:14:34,904
- Let's talk tomorrow.
- No! Let's talk now.

1155
01:14:35,144 --> 01:14:36,425
I'm coming in!

1156
01:14:45,474 --> 01:14:46,956
Why are you coming out of there?

1157
01:14:49,959 --> 01:14:52,001
Why?

1158
01:15:06,295 --> 01:15:08,978
Strangers aren't allowed here.

1159
01:15:09,979 --> 01:15:11,621
I'm no stranger.

1160
01:15:14,904 --> 01:15:16,946
Why are you still awake?

1161
01:15:17,066 --> 01:15:20,229
I can't fall asleep.

1162
01:15:22,912 --> 01:15:24,954
It's nice and quiet here.

1163
01:15:25,675 --> 01:15:28,958
Want me to read you a
book till you fall asleep?

1164
01:15:29,318 --> 01:15:31,240
Are you crazy?

1165
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,842
What if someone sees you?

1166
01:15:33,082 --> 01:15:35,364
Such a virtuous woman!

1167
01:15:35,725 --> 01:15:36,766
At this rate,

1168
01:15:36,886 --> 01:15:38,688
you'll make it to the
Virtuous Women Hall.

1169
01:15:40,009 --> 01:15:42,371
Really? If I become a virtuous woman,

1170
01:15:42,491 --> 01:15:44,173
can't I be a part of
my husband's family?

1171
01:15:47,096 --> 01:15:49,098
Snap out of it, girl.

1172
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,902
A gisaeng can't be a virtuous woman.

1173
01:15:55,104 --> 01:15:57,546
Don't joke with me.

1174
01:16:00,149 --> 01:16:01,671
Why are you here like this?

1175
01:16:01,911 --> 01:16:04,754
Your husband won't care even
if you stay here all night long.

1176
01:16:06,916 --> 01:16:10,760
You should go. I'm fine.

1177
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,724
My husband said he'll come for me.

1178
01:16:16,806 --> 01:16:19,769
Not now, but later.

1179
01:16:43,634 --> 01:16:44,595
Is it interesting?

1180
01:16:45,555 --> 01:16:46,516
It's terrible.

1181
01:16:48,879 --> 01:16:52,362
Why are you buying so many?

1182
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:56,526
I read all my books
until they were worn out.

1183
01:16:57,848 --> 01:16:59,770
Thailand?

1184
01:17:00,731 --> 01:17:01,892
What is this book?

1185
01:17:04,094 --> 01:17:06,617
Ever heard of a
country called Thailand?

1186
01:17:07,938 --> 01:17:11,501
It's far south of China.

1187
01:17:12,422 --> 01:17:14,945
The weather there is
warm all year round.

1188
01:17:15,065 --> 01:17:17,067
It is filled with mystical fruits,

1189
01:17:17,187 --> 01:17:18,869
so people don't ever starve.

1190
01:17:19,189 --> 01:17:21,271
It's a paradise on earth.

1191
01:17:21,592 --> 01:17:23,393
Is there really a country like that?

1192
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:24,394
Of course.

1193
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:27,317
There are even elephants!

1194
01:17:27,437 --> 01:17:29,319
- Ele... what?
- It's amazing.

1195
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,561
The people there raise
animals called elephants

1196
01:17:31,682 --> 01:17:33,563
just like how we raise oxen.

1197
01:17:33,804 --> 01:17:35,686
It's as big as a house.

1198
01:17:36,006 --> 01:17:37,768
Its ears are as big as a sail,

1199
01:17:37,888 --> 01:17:40,611
and its nose is so long!

1200
01:17:41,451 --> 01:17:44,775
I heard it's longer than
a 100-year-old snake.

1201
01:17:45,495 --> 01:17:46,456
No way.

1202
01:17:46,577 --> 01:17:49,179
But it's true!

1203
01:17:50,581 --> 01:17:53,624
When I pass the translator exam,

1204
01:17:54,184 --> 01:17:56,426
I'll take you to Thailand

1205
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:58,589
and let you ride on the elephant!

1206
01:17:58,989 --> 01:18:01,952
Why would a nobleman like you

1207
01:18:02,072 --> 01:18:03,794
not take the state exam

1208
01:18:04,034 --> 01:18:06,997
but prepare for a
low-ranked translator exam?

1209
01:18:13,844 --> 01:18:15,125
You're kidding, right?

1210
01:18:15,525 --> 01:18:19,009
I trust you will pass the state exam

1211
01:18:19,329 --> 01:18:22,372
and become a great
minister in the court.

1212
01:18:22,893 --> 01:18:24,655
Don't worry, sir.

1213
01:18:25,696 --> 01:18:27,497
Oh...

1214
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:30,941
Why?

1215
01:18:31,662 --> 01:18:32,663
Are you done?

1216
01:18:34,865 --> 01:18:36,186
Let's go.

1217
01:18:39,069 --> 01:18:40,270
Sir?

1218
01:18:44,915 --> 01:18:47,317
It hit me.

1219
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:52,522
Because she was kind to
everyone regardless of their class,

1220
01:18:52,643 --> 01:18:55,325
I had forgotten about my lowly status

1221
01:18:55,726 --> 01:19:02,052
and the fact that I had
been deceiving her.

1222
01:19:17,828 --> 01:19:20,550
Sir! Wait!

1223
01:19:44,735 --> 01:19:45,696
Open it.

1224
01:19:58,789 --> 01:20:00,310
Will you marry me?

1225
01:20:01,071 --> 01:20:02,032
Sir?

1226
01:20:03,233 --> 01:20:04,434
Why are you surprised?

1227
01:20:05,115 --> 01:20:06,556
We promised to get married

1228
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:08,478
since we were young.

1229
01:20:08,799 --> 01:20:11,722
But we were playing house...

1230
01:20:11,842 --> 01:20:13,363
I was serious.

1231
01:20:13,764 --> 01:20:16,967
My feelings for you
haven't changed once.

1232
01:20:25,255 --> 01:20:26,817
Please take it back.

1233
01:20:27,377 --> 01:20:28,378
What?

1234
01:20:28,779 --> 01:20:31,381
Until my brother becomes successful,

1235
01:20:32,783 --> 01:20:34,585
I can't get married.

1236
01:20:34,985 --> 01:20:36,386
Don't worry.

1237
01:20:36,627 --> 01:20:39,389
I'll take care of Dong-ju, too.

1238
01:20:43,914 --> 01:20:45,836
Please have dinner before you go.

1239
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:53,403
Is it because of him?

1240
01:21:12,022 --> 01:21:14,024
Find out about Heo Sek.

1241
01:21:14,665 --> 01:21:16,266
Sook-jung?

1242
01:21:17,628 --> 01:21:18,629
Sook-jung?

1243
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:21,551
Sook...

1244
01:21:23,393 --> 01:21:25,555
Ma'am!

1245
01:21:28,799 --> 01:21:30,440
Ma'am...

1246
01:22:01,471 --> 01:22:04,274
Such a virtuous woman!

1247
01:22:04,595 --> 01:22:05,756
At this rate,

1248
01:22:05,876 --> 01:22:08,278
you'll make it to the
Virtuous Women Hall.

1249
01:22:08,599 --> 01:22:10,961
Really? If I become a virtuous woman,

1250
01:22:11,081 --> 01:22:13,043
can't I be a part of
my husband's family?

1251
01:22:13,684 --> 01:22:15,886
Snap out of it, girl.

1252
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:20,611
A gisaeng can't be a virtuous woman.

1253
01:22:24,534 --> 01:22:26,977
I hope her husband will

1254
01:22:27,097 --> 01:22:29,580
love her dearly.

1255
01:22:44,954 --> 01:22:45,955
A gisaeng?

1256
01:22:46,676 --> 01:22:48,197
Did you just say "gisaeng"?

1257
01:22:48,517 --> 01:22:49,518
Yes, sir.

1258
01:22:49,959 --> 01:22:52,682
He's a male gisaeng who serves women.

1259
01:23:06,656 --> 01:23:08,778
Where are we going?

1260
01:23:08,898 --> 01:23:10,339
Just follow me!

1261
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:13,502
<i>Virtuous Women Hall</i>

1262
01:23:18,828 --> 01:23:19,789
Find him!

1263
01:23:36,846 --> 01:23:38,407
What's happening?

1264
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:43,172
He's not here, sir.

1265
01:23:43,573 --> 01:23:46,375
- Look!
- Isn't that Virtuous Women Hall?

1266
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:52,061
You fool!

1267
01:23:52,381 --> 01:23:54,824
You son of a bitch!

1268
01:23:57,226 --> 01:23:59,949
How can this happen?

1269
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:04,594
Who dared to burn this place?

1270
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:12,241
Why did you bother to come here?

1271
01:24:12,361 --> 01:24:13,763
It's no big deal.

1272
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:21,330
Since you're here, let's
all watch the fire together!

1273
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:23,733
You fool!

1274
01:24:24,854 --> 01:24:27,216
Do you know what that is?

1275
01:24:27,456 --> 01:24:29,098
What are you doing?

1276
01:24:29,218 --> 01:24:31,220
Put the fire out now!

1277
01:24:36,666 --> 01:24:38,828
Of course I know what it is!

1278
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:45,434
It forces patience on women
under the guise of fidelity!

1279
01:24:46,355 --> 01:24:47,957
It's a prison that makes women wither

1280
01:24:48,077 --> 01:24:51,160
with the shackles of chastity!

1281
01:24:54,323 --> 01:24:56,926
Men who keep concubines

1282
01:24:57,046 --> 01:24:59,328
because they're not
satisfied with their wives say,

1283
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:02,451
"Serve one husband!"

1284
01:25:03,332 --> 01:25:04,694
"Be submissive to husbands!"

1285
01:25:05,815 --> 01:25:09,659
Haughty men who say wives
must obey their husbands!

1286
01:25:09,779 --> 01:25:11,060
Now!

1287
01:25:13,182 --> 01:25:15,865
To hell with you!

1288
01:25:18,107 --> 01:25:21,831
Damn fool! You'll be punished!

1289
01:25:35,284 --> 01:25:38,848
To my mother and Sook-jung...

1290
01:25:42,251 --> 01:25:44,533
And to you all, I apologize.

1291
01:25:46,095 --> 01:25:49,859
I didn't see the depth of your pains.

1292
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:56,425
I was wrong to just
pity and neglect you.

1293
01:25:58,547 --> 01:26:01,951
The most vulgar man

1294
01:26:02,071 --> 01:26:03,953
in all of Joseon!

1295
01:26:07,476 --> 01:26:08,557
I...

1296
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:15,244
Gisaeng Heo Sek will
take heaven's bitter wrath!

1297
01:26:42,311 --> 01:26:43,272
Step aside!

1298
01:26:44,874 --> 01:26:47,556
Sir! No!

1299
01:26:47,677 --> 01:26:49,238
Watch carefully, Hae-won!

1300
01:26:52,882 --> 01:26:54,483
He is...

1301
01:26:54,604 --> 01:26:56,846
a lowly gibang bachelor!

1302
01:26:57,727 --> 01:26:59,889
He's a male gisaeng who serves women!

1303
01:27:02,131 --> 01:27:04,053
That brute

1304
01:27:04,173 --> 01:27:07,136
has been mocking you!

1305
01:27:15,224 --> 01:27:17,627
Sir! No! Stop!

1306
01:27:17,747 --> 01:27:19,428
Please stop.

1307
01:27:19,548 --> 01:27:24,273
Please spare his life! Please!

1308
01:27:25,554 --> 01:27:26,555
Hae-won...

1309
01:27:27,116 --> 01:27:28,317
How could you?

1310
01:27:32,762 --> 01:27:34,123
Don't mind me!

1311
01:27:34,243 --> 01:27:36,565
I wasn't insulted in any way!

1312
01:27:36,686 --> 01:27:38,728
I beg you!

1313
01:27:39,929 --> 01:27:42,812
Please spare him his life, sir!

1314
01:27:44,974 --> 01:27:46,455
Please.

1315
01:27:55,585 --> 01:27:57,386
Take him to prison.

1316
01:28:13,803 --> 01:28:16,165
If he is a mere offender,

1317
01:28:16,285 --> 01:28:18,487
we wouldn't be here like this.

1318
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:21,851
Right, Minister?

1319
01:28:21,971 --> 01:28:24,413
Why are you asking me?

1320
01:28:24,734 --> 01:28:27,216
I heard your daughter-in-law

1321
01:28:27,336 --> 01:28:29,418
had a lot of fun with him.

1322
01:28:29,538 --> 01:28:31,220
What?

1323
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:32,421
But your daughter

1324
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:34,904
planned to flee by night with him!

1325
01:28:35,825 --> 01:28:38,187
You old miser!

1326
01:28:38,307 --> 01:28:39,829
- Let me go!
- Enough!

1327
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:43,072
Where is your dignity?

1328
01:28:44,634 --> 01:28:47,717
Don't act high and mighty!

1329
01:28:47,837 --> 01:28:48,638
I heard

1330
01:28:48,758 --> 01:28:51,480
your wife and daughter
visited him together!

1331
01:28:54,323 --> 01:28:57,006
You son of a bitch!

1332
01:28:57,126 --> 01:28:59,448
You bastard!

1333
01:28:59,809 --> 01:29:01,651
Get your hands off me!

1334
01:29:01,771 --> 01:29:03,452
I'll beat you up!

1335
01:29:09,058 --> 01:29:11,060
Stop!

1336
01:29:11,821 --> 01:29:13,062
That's enough!

1337
01:29:21,831 --> 01:29:24,714
Such a shameful behavior!

1338
01:29:26,395 --> 01:29:29,478
It's not a matter of mere humiliation.

1339
01:29:29,599 --> 01:29:32,762
If His Majesty hears of
this, what about my family?

1340
01:29:32,882 --> 01:29:35,404
It's not just your family.

1341
01:29:36,726 --> 01:29:41,611
It will affect everyone here.

1342
01:29:41,891 --> 01:29:44,093
I understand what you mean.

1343
01:29:44,453 --> 01:29:48,177
Let's just bury this quietly.

1344
01:30:07,516 --> 01:30:12,481
As promised, I'll take
care of Dong-ju, too.

1345
01:30:27,937 --> 01:30:30,059
I've always waited for you.

1346
01:30:32,702 --> 01:30:34,584
If you tell me to wait longer,

1347
01:30:36,505 --> 01:30:37,466
I will.

1348
01:30:50,079 --> 01:30:55,564
So much silk and jewels!

1349
01:30:55,685 --> 01:30:59,569
Lady Hae-won struck it rich!

1350
01:31:01,971 --> 01:31:03,372
Hae-won.

1351
01:31:13,864 --> 01:31:16,546
Your older brother
is a good-for-nothing.

1352
01:31:17,748 --> 01:31:20,791
I have nothing to give my only sister

1353
01:31:22,552 --> 01:31:25,155
as she's getting married.

1354
01:31:26,276 --> 01:31:30,160
I'm so sorry and sad.

1355
01:31:37,047 --> 01:31:40,811
Why did you do this? Why?

1356
01:31:45,856 --> 01:31:48,138
They're damaged from the winter wind,

1357
01:31:48,258 --> 01:31:51,622
but I picked the best ones.

1358
01:31:51,942 --> 01:31:54,504
Please take them

1359
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:56,827
and share them with your husband.

1360
01:31:59,229 --> 01:32:01,231
I'm so sorry...

1361
01:32:01,632 --> 01:32:04,154
It's okay, dear sister. Don't cry.

1362
01:32:04,595 --> 01:32:06,436
I'm so sorry...

1363
01:32:06,797 --> 01:32:08,078
I'm the one who's sorry.

1364
01:32:09,439 --> 01:32:12,362
- Not on a day like this...
- I'm sorry!

1365
01:32:12,482 --> 01:32:13,924
Don't cry!

1366
01:32:17,487 --> 01:32:19,129
Can't sleep?

1367
01:32:20,971 --> 01:32:24,134
I heard you can't sleep
before the wedding.

1368
01:32:27,858 --> 01:32:30,060
I wish I could get married soon.

1369
01:32:31,061 --> 01:32:33,263
How can you eat that?

1370
01:32:33,864 --> 01:32:36,306
Just one. Want some?

1371
01:32:39,549 --> 01:32:40,991
Pom rak khun.

1372
01:32:41,872 --> 01:32:43,674
Pom rak khun?

1373
01:32:46,276 --> 01:32:47,598
It's pretty.

1374
01:32:49,159 --> 01:32:50,841
The persimmon is so pretty.

1375
01:32:54,524 --> 01:32:56,887
You must be happy to
marry into a good family.

1376
01:32:57,768 --> 01:32:58,649
What if

1377
01:32:58,769 --> 01:33:00,290
you had fallen for that playboy?

1378
01:33:00,571 --> 01:33:03,173
Who cares if his feelings were real?

1379
01:33:03,493 --> 01:33:05,015
Whatever!

1380
01:33:06,296 --> 01:33:07,818
What do you mean?

1381
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:11,301
Ar-soon.

1382
01:33:15,105 --> 01:33:18,148
Deok-se came a few
days ago and said that,

1383
01:33:18,268 --> 01:33:19,870
so I chased him out.

1384
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:23,033
It's bad luck before the wedding.

1385
01:33:27,918 --> 01:33:29,279
Hurry!

1386
01:33:56,266 --> 01:33:59,830
Why would you come here?

1387
01:34:04,595 --> 01:34:06,556
I must hear it from you.

1388
01:34:08,879 --> 01:34:10,320
Hear what?

1389
01:34:12,122 --> 01:34:14,164
Why did you hide everything from me?

1390
01:34:15,766 --> 01:34:18,649
I didn't hide it from you.

1391
01:34:18,769 --> 01:34:20,811
You were foolish not to see.

1392
01:34:21,772 --> 01:34:25,495
Why should I point it out to
you when you didn't even ask?

1393
01:34:26,336 --> 01:34:28,258
It didn't matter!

1394
01:34:30,661 --> 01:34:34,184
I didn't care what you do

1395
01:34:34,304 --> 01:34:36,747
or what class you belong to.

1396
01:34:36,867 --> 01:34:39,229
Those things didn't matter to me.

1397
01:34:43,033 --> 01:34:44,955
But why...

1398
01:34:50,601 --> 01:34:52,322
Why weren't you honest with me?

1399
01:34:55,205 --> 01:34:57,928
That's who I am.

1400
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:02,492
I say sweet lies to entice women.

1401
01:35:04,094 --> 01:35:06,176
I almost won you over, too.

1402
01:35:08,418 --> 01:35:11,141
Too bad you found out.

1403
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:24,114
I'll ask one last thing before I go.

1404
01:35:27,557 --> 01:35:29,559
Even for one second...

1405
01:35:34,244 --> 01:35:37,047
did you not love me?

1406
01:35:39,409 --> 01:35:40,651
I...

1407
01:35:45,335 --> 01:35:46,857
I, Heo Sek...

1408
01:35:49,099 --> 01:35:54,825
I never profess my love to anyone.

1409
01:36:56,647 --> 01:36:58,128
- Aunt!
- Sek!

1410
01:36:58,248 --> 01:36:59,449
Keep your promise!

1411
01:36:59,570 --> 01:37:02,292
Or we'll have to flee by night! Hurry!

1412
01:37:02,412 --> 01:37:03,333
Hurry!

1413
01:37:03,453 --> 01:37:04,254
Thank you.

1414
01:37:04,374 --> 01:37:05,535
Hurry! Let's go!

1415
01:37:11,341 --> 01:37:12,342
Hurry!

1416
01:37:13,143 --> 01:37:15,906
- Hurry! Get on!
- Hurry!

1417
01:37:17,908 --> 01:37:18,989
Go ahead.

1418
01:37:19,109 --> 01:37:20,671
Sek! What do you mean?

1419
01:37:20,791 --> 01:37:23,994
If you're with me,
you'll all be in danger.

1420
01:37:24,354 --> 01:37:26,196
I'll hide on my own,

1421
01:37:26,316 --> 01:37:27,357
so please go.

1422
01:37:27,998 --> 01:37:28,799
Sek!

1423
01:37:28,919 --> 01:37:30,240
But...

1424
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:34,364
When we meet again,
please be wearing clothes.

1425
01:37:37,567 --> 01:37:38,609
Damn fool...

1426
01:37:40,170 --> 01:37:41,131
Aunt.

1427
01:37:41,852 --> 01:37:42,813
Please...

1428
01:37:44,174 --> 01:37:45,816
I wish you good health.

1429
01:37:52,983 --> 01:37:53,984
Well...

1430
01:37:55,586 --> 01:38:00,631
Men leave from
gisaengs' arms all the time.

1431
01:38:02,512 --> 01:38:04,394
It's how we live.

1432
01:38:06,196 --> 01:38:07,998
No need to be sad.

1433
01:38:11,081 --> 01:38:12,923
Let's go.

1434
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:51,722
She's so beautiful!

1435
01:38:56,887 --> 01:38:57,848
Be careful.

1436
01:39:20,190 --> 01:39:21,592
- Heads?
- You sure?

1437
01:39:21,712 --> 01:39:23,714
Stop playing games!

1438
01:39:23,834 --> 01:39:24,715
One last chance.

1439
01:39:24,835 --> 01:39:26,196
Madam is resting!

1440
01:39:26,837 --> 01:39:28,999
Use your head.

1441
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:32,082
- Heads?
- Oh...

1442
01:39:35,806 --> 01:39:38,569
If you're so anxious, why
didn't you go yourself?

1443
01:39:38,689 --> 01:39:40,130
Why you...

1444
01:39:41,091 --> 01:39:43,493
Why would I be anxious?

1445
01:39:44,294 --> 01:39:47,017
I just want to know if he's well

1446
01:39:47,137 --> 01:39:49,019
as I'm passing through.

1447
01:39:49,139 --> 01:39:52,943
It's a long way to come
just to pass through!

1448
01:39:53,063 --> 01:39:55,065
We went 40km off course!

1449
01:39:56,947 --> 01:39:58,869
You couldn't sleep at night

1450
01:39:58,989 --> 01:40:01,391
after learning he lives here.

1451
01:40:02,032 --> 01:40:04,434
Am I right?

1452
01:40:05,515 --> 01:40:06,917
I guess.

1453
01:40:09,039 --> 01:40:13,163
Now that I'm close to dying,
I must miss old memories.

1454
01:40:14,524 --> 01:40:18,729
Why miss the past...

1455
01:40:18,849 --> 01:40:20,410
Aunt Ar-soon!

1456
01:40:20,530 --> 01:40:21,972
There she comes!

1457
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:31,942
I've returned, Madam.

1458
01:40:32,342 --> 01:40:34,665
Good. How is he?

1459
01:40:34,945 --> 01:40:37,868
He's strong as a horse

1460
01:40:37,988 --> 01:40:39,549
and sly as a fox, ma'am.

1461
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:41,391
He hasn't changed.

1462
01:40:42,993 --> 01:40:44,955
I'm glad he is well.

1463
01:40:45,716 --> 01:40:46,757
Well done.

1464
01:40:49,239 --> 01:40:50,681
Let's go home.

1465
01:40:51,161 --> 01:40:52,122
Yes, ma'am.

1466
01:40:54,765 --> 01:40:56,166
What's that?

1467
01:40:57,167 --> 01:41:01,972
It's my portrait. He drew it for me.

1468
01:41:02,332 --> 01:41:04,775
It doesn't resemble you at all...

1469
01:41:06,577 --> 01:41:07,537
What?

1470
01:41:12,623 --> 01:41:14,104
Madam. Look.

1471
01:41:33,003 --> 01:41:34,284
It's ruined.

1472
01:41:34,725 --> 01:41:36,206
It's okay.

1473
01:41:36,807 --> 01:41:39,049
Please draw it for me next time.

1474
01:41:40,811 --> 01:41:43,293
I'll draw your portrait again.

1475
01:41:43,854 --> 01:41:45,415
I promise.

1476
01:41:56,627 --> 01:41:58,108
Pom rak khun.

1477
01:41:59,229 --> 01:42:00,190
Pardon?

1478
01:42:01,231 --> 01:42:03,193
It means "beautiful."

1479
01:42:05,195 --> 01:42:07,117
The portrait is so beautiful.

1480
01:42:08,839 --> 01:42:10,240
No, ma'am.

1481
01:42:11,001 --> 01:42:14,645
He taught me

1482
01:42:14,765 --> 01:42:18,328
a few words from Thailand.

1483
01:42:20,130 --> 01:42:24,054
It means "I love you."

1484
01:42:37,427 --> 01:42:39,109
One sentence...

1485
01:42:41,151 --> 01:42:45,876
Why was it so hard to say?

1486
01:43:47,457 --> 01:43:49,099
Sir. Why didn't you share

1487
01:43:49,219 --> 01:43:52,623
a keepsake with her?

1488
01:43:53,303 --> 01:43:56,587
Like simple rings?

1489
01:43:58,428 --> 01:44:00,510
The scent of flowers that day...

1490
01:44:02,232 --> 01:44:04,474
A sip of tea that day...

1491
01:44:06,276 --> 01:44:08,158
The sound of water flowing...

1492
01:44:12,562 --> 01:44:15,405
The touch of our lips that night...

1493
01:44:19,489 --> 01:44:21,411
My five senses remember

1494
01:44:21,531 --> 01:44:24,655
our every moment together.

1495
01:44:26,256 --> 01:44:29,980
What good is a keepsake?

1496
01:44:31,021 --> 01:44:33,664
When I pass the translator exam,

1497
01:44:33,784 --> 01:44:35,786
I'll take you to Thailand

1498
01:44:35,906 --> 01:44:38,749
and let you ride on the elephant.

1499
01:44:39,950 --> 01:44:42,352
So?

1500
01:44:43,353 --> 01:44:46,997
