1
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:07,295
For many thousands of years ago,
there was an awful weapon

2
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:10,424
and the war has been invented.

3
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:09,857
Don't be impatient, Iksay. The news you
are waiting for is just around the corner.

4
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:14,029
We have been hunting in the next few
days. There are no traces of the game.

5
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:19,242
Gasellerna is gone, as well as the
badgers, fallow deer and wild boar.

6
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:23,412
There is only a buffalo, but how are
we going to be able to attack them?

7
00:03:23,414 --> 00:03:27,583
Don't worry, the great Zot does not
allow us to starve to death.

8
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:31,754
Unfortunately, the ground is shaking
a long time, the last couple of days.

9
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:34,883
The animals are in fresh danger, and
hide in the woods.

10
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:07,206
What is it that makes you feel sad?

11
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:12,421
I need to select the tribe's new
leader.  "As you have made up your mind?

12
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:16,591
I'm too old. Someone else can take my
place.

13
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:23,890
An able and courageous man, who is
able to take advantage of your wisdom.

14
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:27,018
- Calm down, Vood.
- I want to be, Ela.

15
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:31,190
Do not weary yourself before the hunt.

16
00:04:36,403 --> 00:04:40,573
Vood like to be a leader, but he
could not restrain himself.

17
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:45,253
For a woman to have more discipline
than him. How is he going to be able

18
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:46,829
to lead others?

19
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,957
You were like his.

20
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:56,214
A wild ungbuffel as well as rain,
thunder, lightning, and wind.

21
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:59,343
By the time you've been with a man.

22
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:05,598
It will be the same for the Vood.
"I'm not convinced of that, Ra.

23
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:10,813
Are you thinking of someone else? Speak
in Iksay, and I need to know about it.

24
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:17,068
- Ela to convince me.  "It goes
against tradition.

25
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:22,282
Vood, your woman's children. It is he
who must take the lead.

26
00:05:24,368 --> 00:05:28,537
Iksay! Iksay! The wild boar. Many of
the.

27
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:31,667
, In the valley, beyond the area.
 "What are you waiting for!

28
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:37,922
Vood, you are not a leader yet. Wait
here with the others.

29
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:42,093
Ra, the Zots, the name, then I ask
you: If the hunt is successful?

30
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:45,221
Human beings are often more dangerous
than the animal.

31
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:51,478
- You speak obscurely. What do you mean?
Be careful. Others are looking for prey.

32
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:56,692
Please pay attention. I'm with you,
no matter what.

33
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,044
"What is it?
- Rogh! Rogh!

34
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:51,301
- Why is the shout you get?  -
"Hide you in the cave. Don't cry.

35
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:55,472
Calm down, calm down.

36
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:01,640
Iksay.

37
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,896
Iksay.

38
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:14,152
The death of the. B.

39
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:11,977
Great Zot, take Iksays of the spirit.

40
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:16,148
He was a beloved leader, a great
hunter.

41
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:22,405
You are punishing the modlöse, and
the rewarder of the good.

42
00:14:23,448 --> 00:14:27,619
To receive his spirit. We want to
thank you.

43
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,959
When the sun rises, in line with the
tradition of

44
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,130
will be of you in the lead for
the Zots strain.

45
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:42,216
'No!'

46
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:47,429
Vood is not fit to be a leader. He
was murdered in Iksay.

47
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,558
He needs to be punished.

48
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:59,943
That's enough!

49
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:12,455
What are you waiting for? To take him
out.

50
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:39,379
Vood, have come into contact with
his own people's blood. He does not

51
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:40,607
belong to our tribe anymore.

52
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:45,821
- Vood will be hunted as prey.  -
, Ela is right!

53
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:48,950
- Today, Ela is our leader.  - ,
Ela! Ela!

00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:44,214
Run!

55
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:49,427
Watch out!

56
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:55,683
Please help!

57
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:41,563
Mom!!! Mom!!!

58
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,424

- Who are you?  I is institute of
technology.

00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:51,724
I wish to welcome you as the future
ruler.

61

- How do you know my name?  'Our
name is written in the stars.

62
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,385
"Where have you come from
linköping institute of technology?

63
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:03,193
 "From a land beyond the stars.

64
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:08,406
My family worships the Efferon, god
allowed the earth to shake.

65
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:11,523
He wanted to see the one I left in
the middle of people. Now, I am one

66
00:24:11,547 --> 00:24:12,578
of you, Vood.

67
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:31,346
It is a Vood.

68
00:24:31,347 --> 00:24:35,517
Vood, have returned to the fight.

00:24:35,518 --> 00:24:40,118
To provide you with the. As you have
said, " the two of you. You no longer

00:24:40,142 --> 00:24:41,773

- Create the.  - , Ela has already
beaten the Vood.

00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:51,158
Vood, have been given a new coat of
arms of a god. Vood is invincible.

73
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:17,225
What are you waiting for? To kill me,
as Iksay, and Ra.

74
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:20,354
Vood kill you. Vood is the bathroom.

75
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:24,524
- Recognize him as a leader.  "No.

76
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:30,780
Vood to follow god's will. He was
forced to kill the Iksay, and Ra.

77
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:35,994
With this, the Zots tribe is
invincible.

78
00:25:35,995 --> 00:25:39,122
If Vood. The fire god says it is.

79
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:45,378
Otherwise, be angry with him. The earth
is shaking, and everything is burned down.

80
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:50,593
Who of you recognize me, don't like
their leader?

81
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,721
Bring him to me!

82
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:57,892
This time, I will save your life.

83
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:03,104
For six days and nights, be sure to
stop at the apes ' land.

84
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:08,318
No weapons, no food and no water.

85
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,404
We'll have to see how to do it.

86
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:40,553
God gave me a weapon. The one who
follows me will get a like.

87
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:42,639
- Vood!
- Vood!

88
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,852
It was god's will that I might find
the perfect weapon.

89
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:50,980
We are going to be a tribe of the
conquerors.

90
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:56,194
Others may not work for us. Others
may supply us with food.

91
00:28:56,195 --> 00:29:02,450
We will be the rulers. We are going
to show that the hero wins.

92
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:06,621
We are going to introduce a new law.
No one can be against us.

93
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:10,793
We have to be ruthless to everyone. It
will be a pity if those who refuse to obey.

94
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:13,921
Vood! Vood!

- Stop! What do you want?"  -
"None". There is some wear.

97
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,985
Wait.

This.

00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:24,171
Run! Run!

Now, when we are able to blend with
the black stone and no one can stop us."

111
00:35:56,406 --> 00:36:00,577
It is in god's arms.

112
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:07,875
Only we know the secret. To reveal it
to anyone.

113

Clock has it right. The black stone
makes us mighty.

And, Vood, will be our leader.

I can't wait. I would like to fight,
and to force all into submission.

Vood will save your life. From now

But the life of god. No one can take
someone else's prey.

So dies the one who sets himself against the Vood.
- Submit your. If Vood.

Speed up you, Iza.

"I can't be bothered.  "Come, beyond
the forest, we are safe and secure.

We live in the mountains and beyond
the stars. As a little hunting together.

146

His father, the great Iksay, led by
the us.

147
00:45:58,049 --> 00:46:03,261
"But you did not love each other? "No.
Vood's heart became proud and cruel.

148
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:08,475
For he will despise the tradition. I
realized too late just how dangerous he is.

149
00:46:08,476 --> 00:46:13,689
- It is he who has hurt you?
"Yes." Vood don't want to have rivals.

150
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:18,902
He wants to kill me." He's got a new
coat of arms, and the tribe's compliance.

151

My father will help you, Ela. You are

- Stay as you are.  Damage to him.
He is a child.

If they are healthy, strong, and
faithful our god is.

158
00:47:08,953 --> 00:47:12,851
The god who gave us this: "the
power of Darkness, the light and the fire

of the ruler.

160

To have a look. Behind every fire
there is a nomads.

163
00:48:18,815 --> 00:48:24,027
In two of the phases of the moon, all
the strains belonging to the Vood.

00:48:24,028 --> 00:48:26,623
Look it up, Vood. You
are able to get rid of

165
00:48:26,647 --> 00:48:29,241
a powerful king, but
watch out for the Ela.

166
00:48:29,242 --> 00:48:32,370
Ela will be put to death.

167
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:37,583
No one can withstand this new
weapon's power.

168
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:55,309
"What has happened?
- A bear attacked us.

169
00:49:58,915 --> 00:50:03,085
Have a look, there is the Mogos of
the tribe.

170
00:50:11,427 --> 00:50:13,513
Iza!

171
00:50:15,598 --> 00:50:18,726
"It is up to you.  Thank You,
Oria.

172
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:36,452
- Father.
- Iza.

173
00:51:03,563 --> 00:51:05,648
Eat.

174
00:51:11,904 --> 00:51:13,990
Well.

175
00:51:15,032 --> 00:51:20,245
Iza said that you were wounded by a
man from your own tribe.

176
00:51:20,246 --> 00:51:26,501
The wound is open. You'll get the rest on
here. Hospitality is a sacred value for us.

177
00:51:26,502 --> 00:51:31,715
Thank You, Mogo. It makes me feel better.
Your daughter has been caring for me.

178
00:51:31,716 --> 00:51:36,928
I've heard of Zots tribe, who live in
the interior.

179
00:51:36,929 --> 00:51:39,263
It is said that in the day ye eat the
flesh of animals, as well as the city

180
00:51:39,287 --> 00:51:40,057
of the tribe.

181
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:46,312
The hague, the tribe is no more. The
man with the lion-head took it.

182
00:51:46,314 --> 00:51:49,442
The man called Vood.

183
00:51:50,484 --> 00:51:54,654
I don't understand. This has to be
one of them.

184
00:51:54,655 --> 00:51:58,825
Why do Vood come into contact with
the city of blood?

185
00:51:58,826 --> 00:52:01,953
Vood is much worse than that of Rogh,
with the sharp teeth.

186
00:52:01,954 --> 00:52:06,124
Vood is more ferocious than the brown
bear with its strong claws.

187
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:09,252
He has killed up to Iksay, and Ra,
and the wise men.

188
00:52:09,253 --> 00:52:13,423
He was trying to kill me.

189
00:52:13,424 --> 00:52:18,638
Unfortunately, the dominate, is often
to the bestial instinct of the human being.

190
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,807
In each and every one of us lurks the
evil one.

191
00:52:22,808 --> 00:52:25,936
That makes brothers of enemies.

192
00:52:26,979 --> 00:52:32,192
We have to fight against the enemies of
his wisdom and the power of persuasion.

193
00:52:32,193 --> 00:52:37,406
"We should love, not hate.
- Do you think it is possible to, Mogo?

194
00:52:38,449 --> 00:52:40,534
Anything and everything is possible.

195
00:53:57,695 --> 00:54:01,865
The mighty Efferon, you've given me
this weapon.

196
00:54:01,866 --> 00:54:06,035
With these weapons, I will conquer
the land that has risen out of the water.

197
00:54:06,036 --> 00:54:10,206
The land of the long shadows, in the
country, which is always greened.

198
00:54:10,207 --> 00:54:15,421
With these weapons, I will conquer
all, and the honor of your name.

199
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:23,674
Hurry up and enter.

200
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:55,997
The village lies beyond the forest,
on the lake shore.

201
00:56:55,998 --> 00:57:00,169
If my eyes don't deceive me, and so
is the Ela of the village.

202
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:06,424
And this time, he couldn't get away.
- I'm going to have to kill him.

203
00:57:06,425 --> 00:57:08,510
Let's go.

204
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:14,655
Ela would like to have a variety of
weapons. Elah to fight against the

205
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:15,808
Rogh, with the long teeth.

206
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:19,979
No. Mogos tribe has no weapons.

207
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:23,107
We don't need any weapons.

208
00:57:23,108 --> 00:57:27,006
But the beast is destroying the
Mogos village, if not the Mogo to defend

209
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,321
themselves.

210
00:57:28,322 --> 00:57:32,493
We can't go against the grain of our
nature. The weapons are the bad guys.

211
00:57:33,535 --> 00:57:39,792
Unfortunately, the arms, to
bloodshed, and that is a bad thing.

212
00:57:40,834 --> 00:57:46,048
"Life is sacred to us.
- Iza, which is why he does not want to understand?

213
00:57:47,091 --> 00:57:50,218
Mogo is the way. Mogo talk sense.

214
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:53,346
Ela, do not be Rogh. Rogh time has
passed.

215
00:57:53,347 --> 00:57:58,560
Rogh but Vood is coming soon, and
Vood does not go their way.

216
00:57:59,603 --> 00:58:02,730
Vood, may stem the blood flow.

217
00:58:02,731 --> 00:58:08,988
Mogo hasn't done Vood ill. And Vood
does not Mogo bad.

218
00:58:27,756 --> 00:58:29,842
Rogh.

219
00:58:30,884 --> 00:58:35,054
Mogo, you can't let the beast kill
the women and children.

220
00:58:35,055 --> 00:58:38,183
"You need to stop it.  - , Ela
is right.

221
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:44,440
Let's go. What do you consider to be
the right one.

222
00:59:50,113 --> 00:59:55,325
Where is the Ela? Where has he been
hiding? Bring him here dead or alive.

223
00:59:55,326 --> 00:59:58,454
Find him and kill him.

224
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:08,881
Watch carefully over her. She might
know where the Ela is hiding.

225
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:29,734
Stop.

226
01:00:29,735 --> 01:00:33,906
You can't do anything for her.

227
01:00:40,163 --> 01:00:43,291
We have to find him. He will have to
move.

228
01:00:45,376 --> 01:00:50,590
- Search for. He can't have gone far.
 "In way of you.

229
01:01:01,017 --> 01:01:05,188
Com Ela, before it's too late in the
day.

230
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,316
Com.

231
01:01:16,657 --> 01:01:20,827
From now on, Vood you, the new leader.

232
01:01:20,828 --> 01:01:26,041
None of you for a long time. Not even
in your life. It all belongs to the Vood.

233
01:01:26,042 --> 01:01:30,211
Glory be to Vood, and the greatest
warrior.

234
01:01:30,213 --> 01:01:32,297
- Vood.
- Vood!

235
01:01:32,298 --> 01:01:35,425
In honor Vood, honor, your king."

236
01:01:35,426 --> 01:01:39,597
- Glory be to Vood!
- Vood!

237
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,713
The women stay in the
village and work. They

238
01:01:42,737 --> 01:01:44,809
are subject to the
institute of technology.

239
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:48,980
Able-bodied men to come with us.

240
01:01:48,981 --> 01:01:53,151
Now, we know that there is food in
abundance here.

241
01:01:53,152 --> 01:01:57,323
It is here, the people, were to be
serve.

242
01:01:59,408 --> 01:02:02,524
I will leave the village in your
hands, the Clock. The warriors are

243
01:02:02,548 --> 01:02:03,579
replaced every six mo.

244
01:02:04,622 --> 01:02:08,283
- They don't hang out with them.
- Put your trust in me. If you

245
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:09,835
continue to chase the Ela?

246
01:02:10,878 --> 01:02:16,092
Why is that? The eagle kills the
snake, only when it dares to show itself.

247
01:04:11,832 --> 01:04:16,003
Don't touch them. They are a group of
viruses.

248
01:04:38,943 --> 01:04:44,155
We need to walk away. The wounds and causes
of death. Everything in here is tainted.

249
01:04:44,156 --> 01:04:47,284
The Fort here.

250
01:05:25,865 --> 01:05:31,078
Great Vood, there is a need for more
men in order to wear off all of the iron.

251
01:05:34,206 --> 01:05:38,377
Soon we will have more and more of
the men.

252
01:06:05,488 --> 01:06:09,658
"You did that on purpose, your a
fool.  "No.

253
01:06:19,043 --> 01:06:22,171
Get up.

254
01:06:25,299 --> 01:06:27,384
To work.

255
01:06:51,367 --> 01:06:54,495
We will have to do many of these
things.

256
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:03,878
It is wise Mogo does not come to an
agreement.

257
01:07:03,879 --> 01:07:09,092
If Mogo is the way he knows that his
ideas are the only functions in the wild.

258
01:07:09,093 --> 01:07:14,305
But freedom is found in Mogos words
are just words in the wind.

259
01:07:14,306 --> 01:07:18,476
Ela is right, but the Mogos heart is
heavy.

260
01:07:18,477 --> 01:07:22,647
Let Mogo take off his eyes of the
blood.

261
01:07:22,648 --> 01:07:28,904
Please keep in mind: the Weapons you
can give you the freedom back in the day.

262
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:34,118
However, in the morning, they can
deprive you of it.

263
01:07:51,844 --> 01:07:54,972
We can't let him go. To stop him, Ela.

264
01:07:56,015 --> 01:08:00,184
He has made his choice.  "But
he will not survive in the forest.

265
01:08:00,185 --> 01:08:04,355
If he stays, he needs to offer up
their ideas.

266
01:08:04,356 --> 01:08:10,613
Mogos wisdom is more to it than that.
His selection is worthy of our respect.

267
01:08:14,783 --> 01:08:18,953
- Stay as you are, old-timer.
Where are you going?

268
01:08:18,954 --> 01:08:23,124
From everywhere and nowhere.

269
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:26,252
I'm looking for berries to eat and
water to drink.

270
01:08:26,253 --> 01:08:30,423
- What is the tribe you belong to?
- Vildkaninernas of the tribe.

271
01:08:30,424 --> 01:08:34,594
And in the forests, and all of the
other animals.

272
01:08:34,595 --> 01:08:40,850
"You're lying. If you run with
us?  "I have no reason to be.

273
01:08:40,851 --> 01:08:45,021
You are a provocateur. That's what
you are.

274
01:08:45,022 --> 01:08:48,138
Have a look at this
weapon. It is the symbol

275
01:08:48,162 --> 01:08:51,277
of the god of Efferon.
The case of the knee.

276
01:08:51,278 --> 01:08:53,362
"What are you waiting for?
- Case upon his knees.

277
01:08:53,364 --> 01:08:58,576
- A kiss to it.
- Do as he says, the old-timer.

278
01:08:58,577 --> 01:09:00,663
If.

279
01:09:02,748 --> 01:09:05,876
You asked for it, your old man an
idiot.

280
01:09:21,517 --> 01:09:27,772
Now, are you, Voods slaves. I am a
leader.

281
01:09:27,773 --> 01:09:30,900
What was yours is mine.

282
01:09:30,901 --> 01:09:34,028
I have dominion over life and death.

283
01:09:34,029 --> 01:09:39,242
Thanks to this weapon, forcing you to
bend down.

284
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:42,370
You need to be working for me, if you
want to stay alive.

285
01:09:42,371 --> 01:09:47,583
Collect all of the fresh men, and
take them to the volcano.

286
01:09:47,584 --> 01:09:50,700
Where do they dig up the black stone
cornerstone in place, the day and the

287
01:09:50,724 --> 01:09:51,754
night.

288
01:09:51,755 --> 01:09:54,883
If anyone dares to rise up...

289
01:10:02,182 --> 01:10:06,353
- A good one.  Is the Voods
weapons?

290
01:10:08,439 --> 01:10:14,695
No, but it Vood do not expect an
attack. He is full of confidence.

291
01:10:15,738 --> 01:10:18,866
Speed.

292
01:11:04,745 --> 01:11:11,000
- I'm asking you...
- don't Try to escape again.

293
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:14,128
Now you are in charge of the women.

294
01:11:14,129 --> 01:11:18,300
If anyone tries to escape will cost
you your life.

295
01:11:23,514 --> 01:11:24,556
To work.

296
01:13:24,468 --> 01:13:30,723
You guys are the chosen ones. You
guys are the warriors that can't be beat.

297
01:13:30,724 --> 01:13:38,022
Efferon has chosen you, that ye should
honor the Vood, and for the people.

298
01:13:38,023 --> 01:13:45,322
Vood takes you higher and higher. One
day we will become masters of the world.

299
01:14:25,988 --> 01:14:29,116
What is Taag?

300
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:33,286
- Vood, why don't we?  "What do
you say?

301
01:14:34,329 --> 01:14:39,542
Vood can be satisfied. We have taken
a lot of people.

302
01:14:39,543 --> 01:14:43,712
We are the rulers of the valley. No
one will dare to rebel.

303
01:14:43,714 --> 01:14:48,926
When you quit the exercise of its
power, it is the beginning of the end.

304
01:14:48,927 --> 01:14:53,097
We are living in the battle. War is
our purpose in life.

305
01:14:53,098 --> 01:14:57,268
What can it be used a weapon to
silence?

306
01:14:57,269 --> 01:15:01,440
"Everybody hates us, Vood.
"No," they will fear us.

307
01:15:03,525 --> 01:15:09,780
We can't stop it. Don't forget, Ela.
As long as he's alive-

308
01:15:09,781 --> 01:15:12,909
-we are in trouble.

309
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:22,293
I was his slave. Its origin is lost.

310
01:15:22,294 --> 01:15:28,549
I had to be obedient to him, but for
now, I want to take revenge.

311
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:32,720
"In what way?
- Vood is a cunning and slippery.

312
01:15:32,721 --> 01:15:36,801
However, he has been a sore point:
the fact that Vood is doing what, as

313
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:38,976
a whole, in order to prove his power.

314
01:15:38,977 --> 01:15:44,190
- Don't trust her, she's lying.
"No," how does it benefit me to lie?

315
01:15:44,191 --> 01:15:49,403
If you want to get revenge, you'll
see that he's coming here either.

316
01:15:49,404 --> 01:15:54,617
- What is your plan?  I just want
to challenge him.

317
01:15:54,618 --> 01:15:59,831
Go to the Vood is now. You are
clever, to convince him.

318
01:16:04,002 --> 01:16:07,129
- Do you trust her?  "No.

319
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:10,258
However, Vood must know that I am
here.

320
01:16:15,472 --> 01:16:20,684
Where is my father?  He would
have preferred to go.

321
01:16:20,685 --> 01:16:24,855
He didn't want to see his the tribe
to fight.

322
01:16:24,856 --> 01:16:29,026
However, you have to fight, Iza.
Along with me, to Vood.

323
01:16:29,027 --> 01:16:33,197
As for the others, do what you
do.  "It is a suicide.

324
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:39,453
Our boys are not warriors. Vood has
been one of god's weapons.

325
01:16:39,454 --> 01:16:42,581
The weapon is man-made.

326
01:16:42,582 --> 01:16:47,795
Vood, have a lot of strain. How are
you going to stop them?

327
01:16:47,796 --> 01:16:53,008
Neither the number of the men or
their guns scare me.

328
01:16:53,009 --> 01:16:57,179
They are different, and Iza. For
them, life has no value.

329
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:02,393
They love to kill. It scares me, Iza.

330
01:17:02,394 --> 01:17:06,564
"We must put a stop to them.
- You'll also spills the blood of the.

331
01:17:06,565 --> 01:17:10,734
What is the difference between them?

332
01:17:10,735 --> 01:17:13,862
I can understand why my father left.

333
01:17:13,864 --> 01:17:16,992
Maybe I should do as he says.

334
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:28,461
Watch the Ela, this is what the tree
is.

335
01:17:37,846 --> 01:17:43,059
We can't be beat Vood, with a few
boughs, and Daal.

336
01:17:51,401 --> 01:17:55,571
- Why did you stop?  "I have won.
The war was over.

337
01:17:55,572 --> 01:17:58,699
You don't think so. It's just stupid.

338
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:02,870
They have horrible weapons, and
fought to kill.

339
01:18:02,871 --> 01:18:09,126
When you're on the ground, undoes the
top stomach in the er.

340
01:18:09,127 --> 01:18:12,255
Step right up and start all over.

341
01:18:16,426 --> 01:18:20,596
"You are too hard on them.
- It is not enough.

342
01:18:20,597 --> 01:18:26,852
You are blinded by your father's
ideas. Why, do you not?

343
01:18:26,853 --> 01:18:31,023
My father made his choices and I make
mine.

344
01:18:31,024 --> 01:18:34,152
I would like to help you out. I was
thinking of stopping by.

345
01:19:24,202 --> 01:19:28,372
"Can't you not sleep?
- I don't get tired.

346
01:19:28,373 --> 01:19:31,501
But now I'm going to sleep.

347
01:19:36,715 --> 01:19:38,800
Vood!

348
01:19:39,843 --> 01:19:40,885
Vood!

349
01:19:41,928 --> 01:19:47,141
He is a boy, and three women. The
women don't count.

350
01:19:47,142 --> 01:19:51,311
You can easily kill him. A dozen men
will suffice.

351
01:19:51,313 --> 01:19:57,568
"I would also like to fight. Where do we go?
- Impatience is associated with passion.

352
01:19:57,569 --> 01:20:00,696
There's a dangerous feel to it. The
suspect, Ela you?

353
01:20:00,697 --> 01:20:03,825
No, I don't think so.

354
01:20:04,868 --> 01:20:12,167
Go back to the village. Let's say I accept
the challenge and are going it alone.

355
01:21:02,217 --> 01:21:06,386
Tighten it a little to aim for.

356
01:21:06,388 --> 01:21:10,557
Say to yourself, "I'm spike, and I'm
going to hit the target."

357
01:21:10,558 --> 01:21:14,729
I am in the lead. To meet the goal.

358
01:21:16,815 --> 01:21:18,900
Well.

359
01:21:28,284 --> 01:21:33,497
Don't even think about the next day.
Iza fight by your side.

360
01:21:33,498 --> 01:21:37,669
We can do it, you'll see.

361
01:22:12,078 --> 01:22:16,249
Ela! Vood, in the morning. Alone.

362
01:22:17,292 --> 01:22:20,408
"All Right, Linköping Institute Of
Technology. Go to the others now.

363
01:22:20,432 --> 01:22:21,463
 "But Ela...

364
01:22:24,591 --> 01:22:29,804
Go back to your seat and pay
attention.

365
01:23:19,854 --> 01:23:24,024
Stop Ideas!! He is our friend.

366
01:23:24,025 --> 01:23:28,196
Sorry, Iza, and in the darkness he
looked like one of the Voods men.

367
01:23:29,239 --> 01:23:31,120
What are they, and Iza?

368
01:23:31,144 --> 01:23:35,494
Tracks, and the Jeda,
which the men of our tribe.

369
01:23:35,495 --> 01:23:40,707
"What has happened? How did you
get here?  We managed to escape.

370
01:23:40,708 --> 01:23:48,007
Vood, forcing us to work. In two days
we have been wandering without any food.

371
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:52,177
It is better to die, and Iza, than it
is to be Voods of the slave.

372
01:23:52,178 --> 01:23:58,434
- Please help us.  Yes, if you'll
help us to beat Vood.

373
01:24:43,271 --> 01:24:46,399
No, no, you stay here.

374
01:25:27,065 --> 01:25:30,193
Ela! Ela!

375
01:25:32,278 --> 01:25:34,364
Where are you Ela?

376
01:25:42,705 --> 01:25:44,791
Ela!

377
01:25:50,004 --> 01:25:52,090
To stay there.

378
01:25:53,132 --> 01:25:57,302
- Vood! Vood!  - , Ela!

379
01:25:57,303 --> 01:25:59,389
Look it up, Vood!

380
01:26:08,773 --> 01:26:10,858
Here I am, Vood.

381
01:26:27,542 --> 01:26:29,626
Vood!

382
01:26:29,627 --> 01:26:32,755
- You must hurry!
- Vood!

383
01:26:47,353 --> 01:26:51,523
Stop. Please come back.

384
01:26:51,524 --> 01:26:53,609
Coward, to attack.

385
01:28:25,368 --> 01:28:27,453
Ela.

386
01:29:56,083 --> 01:29:58,168
You won't Spli.

387
01:29:58,169 --> 01:30:05,468
But one day, there will be another
Vood.

388
01:30:26,322 --> 01:30:30,493
Remember, in Ela: a Weapon can give
you the freedom back in the day

389
01:30:31,535 --> 01:30:34,662
"but in the morning, they can
deprive you of it.

390
01:30:34,664 --> 01:30:38,834
Violence gives birth to violence.
