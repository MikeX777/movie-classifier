00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:22,598
Hey,help yourself with one,Brown

3
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:24,639
No thanks,I've to keep
track of one of those

4
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:28,600
-Nice chap that Brown
-Useful to when there's an occasional(?) strike

5
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,839
-Been here long?
-About 2 years

6
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:32,478
Come from some rough water I believe

7
00:01:32,947 --> 00:01:34,037
Where have you been Tom?

8
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:35,542
Haven't seen you for a couple of days

9
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,752
I've been busy

10
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,134
Got no right(?) to buy a ?????

11
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:42,477
-I should think so
-Right I'll bring him around later

12
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:43,700
Been busy in "Lander"

13
00:01:44,418 --> 00:01:46,439
But I didn't exactly get him out on the sea

14
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:22,773
Half a bitter,please

15
00:02:52,024 --> 00:02:53,024
Burden

16
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:02,021
What's the matter Brown?
You look as you've seen a ghost

17
00:03:28,914 --> 00:03:30,008
Hello Burden

18
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:32,390
My name is Brown

19
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:35,302
Oh yes,how stupid of me

20
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:37,218
You must be careful what we say mustn't we?

21
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:39,620
You remember me don't you?

22
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,833
Newman,Corporal Newman,
I've just been demobbed

23
00:03:45,322 --> 00:03:46,506
Take me on,chap

24
00:03:47,373 --> 00:03:48,431
All right come on

25
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:55,948
Nice little place you got here Burden

26
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:58,045
Better than the Glasshouse(Mil.pris),eh?

27
00:03:58,564 --> 00:03:59,806
Well,what do you intend to do?

28
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:03,385
I might do nothing, all depends

29
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,974
What made you desert Burden?

30
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,862
If you'd been a bit longer
 you'd been out now

31
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:11,938
-I had my reasons,very good reason
-So have thousands of others

32
00:04:12,014 --> 00:04:13,102
And look at them today

33
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:16,721
On the run,all of them,like you

34
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:19,928
You ever thought of giving yourself up?

35
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:20,988
What for?

36
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:24,223
No,the war cost me everything
 I ever had,Newman

37
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:26,681
If they want me they got to catch me

38
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:29,238
They talked about clemency
sometime ago didn't they?

39
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:31,492
Made a deadline for us to give ourselves up

40
00:04:31,592 --> 00:04:32,878
I know a man who fell for that

41
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:37,163
What did he get? Two years
hard labour in a detention barracks

42
00:04:37,163 --> 00:04:38,821
And he sent his review every three months

43
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:40,622
Does that make you
want to give yourself up?

44
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,557
This was a man with a wife and two kids

45
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:44,513
 and three years overseas
service to his credit

46
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:48,170
I've done my share nearly four years of it

47
00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:51,460
War is over now and I just
want to be left alone

48
00:04:52,836 --> 00:04:55,462
Well,if that's how you feel

49
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:58,592
What's it worth to you?

50
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:01,551
What's it worth to?

51
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:03,700
I'll give this straight Burden

52
00:05:04,213 --> 00:05:05,351
You're nicely fixed up yeah?

53
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:07,688
It's ten thousand to one
against anyone else

54
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:10,158
 from our lot ever coming within
hundred miles of the place

55
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:11,770
They're mostly from the north anyway

56
00:05:13,018 --> 00:05:16,034
So there's no reason why you shouldn't
 go on in peace and quiet indefinitely

57
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:17,575
That is if you're sensible

58
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:21,274
Peace and quiet,you don't
really think that,do you?

59
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:22,559
Why not?

60
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:25,013
Why not? I'll tell you why not

61
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:27,628
Phoney identity card phony ration book

62
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,229
Five pounds to a man up north every time

63
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,818
there's a new issue, always on edge

64
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:33,212
Still prefer it to the
Glasshouse ,don't you?

65
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:39,180
Now listen to it, we've
 all got our troubles

66
00:05:40,058 --> 00:05:41,150
Take me

67
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:43,451
Before the war I was down the mine

68
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:45,807
I've no intention of ever going back

69
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:48,408
I've been too long above
ground now and I like it

70
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:51,459
The only other trade I know is killing

71
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:52,737
And that's gone out of fashion

72
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:55,527
I'm sick and tired of the army

73
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:56,928
I want a bit of freedom

74
00:05:57,546 --> 00:05:59,535
But like you I've got to earn money

75
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:01,941
So till something better comes along

76
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,607
I've taken a job at the local manor

77
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:05,617
My sisters is married one
 of the game keepers

78
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:07,827
And he needs to fix me up
 as a sort of general man

79
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:10,005
But the money's bad

80
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,109
That's where you come in to help me out

81
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:18,694
I'll settle for 20 pounds down
and two pounds a week

82
00:06:18,694 --> 00:06:20,607
-Blackmail
-Call it what you like

83
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:21,748
That's how it is

84
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,627
How much you think I earn,for heavens sake?

85
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:24,879
I don't know and I don't care

86
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:27,335
-Well I haven't got 20 Â£ to start with
-Then find it

87
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:28,574
Tell me if you want to

88
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:32,391
And if you don't I'll turn you in

89
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,212
I'll come back tonight

90
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,190
Who is it?

91
00:07:33,774 --> 00:07:36,368
It's me how about some rent Brown

92
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:37,833
You haven't paid me for four weeks

93
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,458
 I'm not going to let it run any longer

94
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,059
All right I'll let you have it
I'm going out in a minute or two

95
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:44,166
Don't come back without it
 or you won't get in again

96
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:46,064
And don't try to take
your things out either

97
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:48,220
Or I might start asking some
 more awkward questions

98
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,402
-Henry
-All right

99
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:23,757
"I am sorry that I cannot help you myself
But you will remember that I told you

100
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,026
about the jeweller Collins,

101
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:28,052
he will convert everything into
cash You understand what I mean"

102
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:03,728
-Thank you
-Thank you

103
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:15,174
-Mr Collins
-Yes

104
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:18,610
Stay where you are and don't move

105
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,844
Don't you move or I let you have it

106
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:10,506
Thank you

107
00:10:16,306 --> 00:10:17,306
Thank you

108
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:24,364
"Don't you move or I let you have it"

109
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:32,595
Police Constable Martin who was shot

110
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:34,521
this afternoon in Golden Street whilst

111
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:36,571
trying to intercept the two armed men

112
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,934
concerned in the hold-up of the

113
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:39,886
jewel shop has since died

114
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:43,058
The police under the
direction of divisional

115
00:11:43,058 --> 00:11:45,414
Detective Inspector Mitchell are sparing

116
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,490
no efforts in their hunt for the wanted men

117
00:11:49,764 --> 00:11:51,215
owing to the fact that both men were

118
00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:52,906
masked it's difficult to obtain an

119
00:11:52,906 --> 00:11:54,473
accurate description of either of them

120
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:57,056
except their clothes and the fact that

121
00:11:57,056 --> 00:11:58,944
one of them was tall and thin

122
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:02,082
the bullet from Martin's
body has been extracted

123
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:04,032
and given to the ballistics expert

124
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:05,946
and the shop is being searched for

125
00:12:05,946 --> 00:12:09,844

have been recalled to duty

129
00:12:16,023 --> 00:12:17,842
and in view of the gravity of the situation

130
00:12:17,942 --> 00:12:20,016
many of them have been issued with arms

131
00:12:22,104 --> 00:12:24,211
Their orders are bring these

132
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:25,879

"Scotland Yard is searching for
Martin's murderer. Since this morning,

135
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,252
the best officers of Scotland Yard are searching for the two men
who fatally wounded sergeant Martin in their hold-up of jeweller Collins.

136
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:03,522
 Unfortunately, Mr. Robb Collins has not regained consciousness
yet, but the police hope that he will soon be able to give information.

137
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:04,656
I want urgently the next train to

Hello,what's your game?
Bitter-Two bitters,Doris

147
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:51,958
-What type?this Golden street murderer,eh?
-They'll catch him all right,don't you worry

148
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,300
It's not much help for the
copper that got shot now,is it?

149
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,928
He's just come back out of the army too

150
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:57,299
What about his wife and kid!

151
00:13:57,398 --> 00:13:59,240
I know my chaps being on the fiddle

152
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,870
but I draw the line of this kind
 of thing and I'm not kidding

153
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,179
-Five past you know
-Thank you

154
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:09,046
Good Luck

155
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,350
-You got any gin?
-Yes

156
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,402
Give it two large ones,will you?

157
00:14:17,098 --> 00:14:20,054
Well what did you do in the
world war daddy? Don't tell me I know

158
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:22,575
Fire watching ha,ha

159
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:26,434
You don't mind my having a drink,do you?

160
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:29,506
-I mean I'm not crowding you out?
-That's all right

161
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:33,606
Scores of people have been
questioned in and around Golden street

162
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,850
And many were taken to the police station

163
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,902
to make statements

164
00:14:38,362 --> 00:14:42,192
A short while ago Mr Rob Collins the
jeweller recovered consciousness

165
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:45,495
 and has given the police a description
of one of the three men

166
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:47,033
now known to have been involved

167
00:14:48,077 --> 00:14:50,854
for some reason this man
who was wearing a raincoat

168
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:53,178
was not masked like the other two

169
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:55,381
This fact has given the police

170
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:56,647
a very valuable lead

171
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:59,723
every policeman in the country
 has this man's description

172
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:02,600
and there is to be an all-out
drive to bring him in

173
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,723
Here,where's my money?

174
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:06,569
Somebody pinched my dough?

175
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:08,647
Just a minute where do
you think you're off to?

176
00:15:08,747 --> 00:15:11,444
I don't know what you're talking
about I haven't touched your money

177
00:15:11,486 --> 00:15:13,462
Hey Bert,will you give me
cover have him bagged

178
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:15,784
I tell you I haven't touched it,
or your rotten baskets?

179
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:17,220
You better don't do it(?) again

180
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,192
Listen I just getting in here
 to get away from that

181
00:15:39,192 --> 00:15:41,244
No need to be frightened
I won't hurt you really

182
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:44,009
You're living upstairs come on
 tell me quickly your place

183
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:46,176
Right

184
00:15:46,252 --> 00:15:48,370
If I let you go,you won't
 scream anything will you?

185
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:49,450
Will you?

186
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:50,637
Good

187
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:54,553
Thank you

188
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:58,264
What are you running away from?

189
00:15:58,329 --> 00:15:59,490
Don't ask me questions,please

190
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,749
I'm in trouble serious trouble
 just leave it like that

191
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:03,472
I can't go out yet you'll have let me stay

192
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:04,708
until things die down a bit

193
00:16:05,122 --> 00:16:07,232
I'll get out of here as
soon as I can I promise you

194
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:08,584
Please

195
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,834
I'm sorry to force myself on you like this

196
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:25,360
But I had to think quickly

197
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:29,199
Wait a minute

198
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,544
All right

199
00:16:52,771 --> 00:16:54,895
-Where's your husband?
-My husband's dead

200
00:16:54,895 --> 00:16:55,916
I'm sorry

201
00:16:56,968 --> 00:16:58,349
I noticed you were wearing a ring

202
00:16:58,449 --> 00:16:59,452
I thought perhaps

203
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,065
They're raiding that cafÃ© over there

204
00:17:21,452 --> 00:17:23,060
Listen I got to tell somebody about this

205
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,065
or I shall go off my head

206
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:27,083
Did you read about that hold up in
the jewellery shop all are talking of?

207
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,901
-Yes
-That's what I mixed up in that

208
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:31,324
But I've noting to do with it,
nothing at all,you understand?

209
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:32,328
It's all mistake

210
00:17:32,332 --> 00:17:34,547
Oh don't look at me like
that I'm telling you the truth

211
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:35,687
You see this

212
00:17:35,772 --> 00:17:37,311
All right don't worry it's not loaded

213
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:39,661
Hasn't been for years nothing
 since I used it in the army

214
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,902
Somebody told me where I
could get a good price for it

215
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,351
And I went to jeweller to sell it

216
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:45,420
I'm broke that's all I had

217
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:48,478
Before I could find out how much
he'd give me I was caught in the hold up

218
00:17:48,505 --> 00:17:50,252
And I'm standing there with this in my hand

219
00:17:50,263 --> 00:17:52,498
Within two seconds they'd
knocked the jeweller senseless

220
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:54,573
As far as he's concerned I'm one of them

221
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,122
Do you get a 9 o'clock news?

222
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,843
-No,what's happened?
-He's just recovered consciousness

223
00:17:58,943 --> 00:18:00,426
He's given the police my description

224
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:02,718
That's what that's all about

225
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,711
They've gone

226
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:21,754
-You're a deserter aren't you?
-Yes

227
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:25,307
Don't think I'm ashamed because I'm not

228
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,295
For the same reason I'd do it again

229
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:31,233
I served overseas for four
 years before I deserted

230
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:32,752
And ??? Dunkirk

231
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:34,639
I gave up my business and everything

232
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:36,788
Lot of people people I know didn't

233
00:18:38,591 --> 00:18:40,393
My business was pretty good for them

234
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,921
Was that the only reason you deserted?

235
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:45,623
No

236
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:48,769
A flying bomb hit the house where we lived

237
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:51,298
My father was killed outright
my sister was very badly injured

238
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:54,813
I asked for compassionate leave came home

239
00:18:54,838 --> 00:18:57,137
Fixing up as best as 
I could and that was that

240
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:00,865
Two days before my time was up

241
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:04,763
The doctor told us my sister
 might not pull through

242
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:10,404
My mother was frantic I wired for
an extension but it was refused

243
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:12,260
Refused because I was single

244
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:15,702
So I took it

245
00:19:17,345 --> 00:19:18,887
Three days later my sister died

246
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:20,929
But I was with her

247
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:24,775
That's all I asked after four years
that's all I asked and they refused

248
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:28,486
Within two days my mother followed her

249
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:30,822
Shock and everything was too much

250
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:32,726
So I didn't go back

251
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:37,399
Well,do you believe any of this
or am I just wasting my time?

252
00:19:38,256 --> 00:19:40,418
No,I believe you

253
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:46,969
The police they must be checking now

254
00:19:47,581 --> 00:19:49,180
-Is any one for roof?
-No

255
00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:51,798
And all the windows  the back at barred

256
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:57,671
They can see the light
I shall have to open it

257
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:58,827
Yes,of course

258
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:00,483
Leave it to me

259
00:20:07,115 --> 00:20:08,738
We're police officers we have authority

260
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:10,344
to search all premises in this area

261
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:11,420
Why? What's happened?

262
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:13,909
We're looking for a man
who was last seen in this street

263
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:15,264
We have reason to believe he's

264
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:16,590
hiding in one of these buildings

265
00:20:16,977 --> 00:20:18,069
-You alone?
-Yes

266
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,433
Did you see or heard anything
unusual in the past quarter of an hour?

267
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,997
Only the raid on the cafÃ©
I saw it from upstairs

268
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:25,900
-You sure that's all?
-Yes

269
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:27,629
I see

270
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:30,632
I think we have a look anyway

271
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:44,774
You have a look upstairs

272
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:18,395
-Well?
-No one upstairs

273
00:21:18,837 --> 00:21:20,010
No way out on to the roof

274
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:24,010
-What's your name,Madam
-Adams,Jean Adams

275
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,653
-Mrs?
-Yes,I'm a widow

276
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:30,297
-You work anywhere?
-Yes at "Weatherbin" in Oxford Street

277
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:32,329
Tell me Mrs.Adams

278
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:34,494
Why did you take so
long to answer the door?

279
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:39,188
I was just going to bed I'd started
 to undress and had to get dressed again

280
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:41,420
I suppose it's very early for a
 young woman,don't you?

281
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,705
I get up very early

282
00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:44,576
I work hard,you know

283
00:21:45,335 --> 00:21:47,436
I'm so tired this morning
I didn't even make the bed

284
00:21:48,157 --> 00:21:49,331
So I noticed

285
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:53,267
All right Mrs.Adams,sorry
 to have troubled you

286
00:22:41,128 --> 00:22:42,921
-All right
-Yes

287
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:46,234
Thank you

288
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:48,276
You can't go out they're
 searching the street

289
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:49,967
You're right

290
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,588
If I was seen leaving here
now from this house hard for you

291
00:22:53,128 --> 00:22:54,500
It's a crime to shield a deserter

292
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,049
Especially one in my position

293
00:22:57,035 --> 00:22:58,448
Look I feel terrible about all this

294
00:22:59,592 --> 00:23:01,236
You look as if you could do with a drink

295
00:23:01,586 --> 00:23:03,483
I've got a little brandy

296
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,964
Thank you

297
00:23:24,606 --> 00:23:25,738
-Your husband ?
-Yes

298
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,993
-Killed in action?
-No,died of wound

299
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:30,102
I'm sorry

300
00:23:30,102 --> 00:23:31,740
Were you very fond of him?

301
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:33,945
We were separated

302
00:23:35,056 --> 00:23:36,510
He thought he'd find someone else

303
00:23:36,688 --> 00:23:37,701
Divorce?

304
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:40,727
No,war broke out he joined
up and he let things drift

305
00:23:41,627 --> 00:23:43,016
Everyone seemed to at that time

306
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:48,087
Just before Dunkirk he was
badly wounded and sent back

307
00:23:49,552 --> 00:23:51,497
When he came out of hospital

308
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,123
He was alone

309
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:55,024
It was no one to look after him

310
00:23:55,124 --> 00:23:56,240
So I let him come back here

311
00:23:58,412 --> 00:24:00,916
He had a relapse and they operated again

312
00:24:02,128 --> 00:24:03,703
It was no use

313
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,420
Why am I telling you all this?

314
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,031
I don't know

315
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:11,266
Maybe because you wanted to
talk to somebody like I did just now

316
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,666
What's your name?

317
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,444
Burden,Peter Burden

318
00:24:15,223 --> 00:24:17,340
at the moment I'm going
under the name of Brown

319
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:20,085
I know yours I heard you tell him

320
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:22,552
Do you mind if I sit down for a moment?

321
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:28,570
How long is it since you've eaten?

322
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:31,696
I was just having a sandwich
 when all this started

323
00:24:32,462 --> 00:24:34,355
I'll get you something
you can sleep on there

324
00:24:34,454 --> 00:24:36,749
Mrs Adams I'm a deserter remember?

325
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:38,834
I can't shield myself behind you

326
00:24:39,674 --> 00:24:41,310
Especially now I know about your husband

327
00:24:42,442 --> 00:24:43,586
I got to get out of here

328
00:24:45,243 --> 00:24:46,819
I can without you getting mixed in it

329
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,826
Look you're safe here
and I'm going to help you

330
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:50,455
-Why?
-I don't know

331
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:53,093
Perhaps it's because you so badly need help

332
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,228
Besides it's no use running away

333
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:56,453
You're caught up in a murder

334
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,439
And somehow you've got to
get yourself out of it

335
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:01,465
Yes,I could if I knew I
could find those two men

336
00:25:03,563 --> 00:25:04,573
That's impossible

337
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:06,792
Apart from what they were
 wearing all I've got to go on

338
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:07,969
is the voice of one of them

339
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:15,092
Tall thin man with half the two middle
 fingers missing on his left hand

340
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,226
Where they've been shut off

341
00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:22,803
Yes,a voice I can remember anywhere
 with a strong Australian accent

342
00:25:40,931 --> 00:25:43,064
"I'm getting you a toothbrush!"

343
00:26:08,285 --> 00:26:10,256
-Very good morning Mrs Adams
-Good Morning Tony

344
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:12,473
-You're very early I only just opened
-I know

345
00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:14,518
I wondered if you could
let me have a little milk

346
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:17,098
I've got it,Rosa put some
milk in her bottle for Mrs Adams

347
00:26:17,154 --> 00:26:18,842
-Thank you Tony
-That's all right

348
00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:21,220
-I want some cigarettes
-Sorry no cigarettes

349
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:26,748
-20 players that's all right
-That's fine

350
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,466
That's a 3sh 6p for the cigarettes

351
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:31,241
-I'll give you the milk
-Thank you

352
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:33,066
How long have you been smoking,eh?

353
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:34,830
Quite sometime

354
00:26:35,947 --> 00:26:38,093
-Everything for peace
-For peace

355
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:40,451
There's no peace did you
hear that business last night?

356
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:42,113
Yes,I was going to ask you about that

357
00:26:42,113 --> 00:26:43,671
I saw the raid from my window

358
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:46,495
A fine thing to do to a
respectable British citizen

359
00:26:46,495 --> 00:26:48,410
All that fuss till they find the gunmen

360
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,094
No,nothing but they still
think he's around here

361
00:26:51,094 --> 00:26:52,811
I'll bet you the district is being watched

362
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,106
All these lousy deserters
that's the trouble

363
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:58,837
Yeah,the bottle is quite clean I hope

364
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,184
Thank you,Tony

365
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:20,295
-I've been just over to the cafÃ©
-Well?

366
00:27:20,295 --> 00:27:22,127
Apparently the whole
district being watched

367
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:25,250
Here's the toothbrush and I brought
 you some cigarettes and a paper

368
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,403
Thank you

369
00:27:26,454 --> 00:27:28,058
They haven't published your description

370
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:31,361
They never do it might
prejudice their case in court

371
00:27:31,365 --> 00:27:33,405
It's in the hands of every
policeman in the country

372
00:27:33,505 --> 00:27:36,279
-That's just as bad
-I'll get some breakfast

373
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:41,196
"Martin's killers: There were three of them. The third one
was wearing a raincoat. A thorough search for the third man is underlay

374
00:27:41,296 --> 00:27:43,196
..All the restaurants and private places in the
respective part of the city are being searched ..."

375
00:27:43,543 --> 00:27:45,336
-You say he had a moustache
-Yes,definitely

376
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,414
It's our man all right

377
00:27:48,414 --> 00:27:51,481
He must have shaved it off between
getting rid of this and going to that pub

378
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:52,736
Is the raincoat any use to you?

379
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:55,139
I doubt it these people must have turned

380
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:56,983
out thousands like
this all exactly the same

381
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,456
No chance for checking any of them

382
00:27:58,503 --> 00:27:59,842
Still will take it along with us

383
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:02,802
-And thanks for your cooperation
-That's all right

384
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:05,505
There you are

385
00:28:09,635 --> 00:28:10,665
Thank you

386
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:14,101
Here you are

387
00:28:20,563 --> 00:28:23,347
-Am I glad to see you!
-Getting nervous

388
00:28:23,347 --> 00:28:25,960
Very I'm afraid being cooped,
up here all alone like this

389
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:27,955
Not that I'm not grateful Mrs.Adams

390
00:28:28,055 --> 00:28:31,182
Hadn't you better call me Jean
seems you're likely to be here sometime

391
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:32,750
Yes I suppose I should

392
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,442
Do you mind if I see that?

393
00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:36,222
They know the type of gun that was used

394
00:28:37,946 --> 00:28:39,542
-What's the matter?
-Nothing

395
00:28:39,542 --> 00:28:41,859
-Yes,there is,what is it?
-Nothing,nothing to it really

396
00:28:43,851 --> 00:28:45,128
-Tell me something
-Yes

397
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:46,905
What type of gun is yours?

398
00:28:47,522 --> 00:28:48,880
Why? What makes you ask?

399
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,925
I just want to know

400
00:28:51,692 --> 00:28:52,743
38 Enfield

401
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,133
Same type that one
 that killed the policeman

402
00:28:55,147 --> 00:28:56,209
Yes

403
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,405
-You don't doubt me do you?
-Is that what's worrying you ?

404
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,254
-Partly
-No

405
00:29:06,434 --> 00:29:08,316
If you did I think that
would be about the end

406
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:10,254
It becomes dangerous to you

407
00:29:10,378 --> 00:29:11,387
must get rid of it

408
00:29:11,487 --> 00:29:14,677
Have you tried to get rid of anything in
 a place like London in broad daylight?

409
00:29:16,738 --> 00:29:17,864
We'll get rid of it tonight

410
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:21,802
I'll throw it in the river

411
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,255
What are you doing,Miss?

412
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,876
Don't think you're throwing
yourself over,are you?

413
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,283
No,of course not

414
00:29:45,356 --> 00:29:47,721
-Just getting a breath of fresh air
-I see

415
00:29:48,627 --> 00:29:50,390
A bit late for that sort of thing isn't it?

416
00:29:51,571 --> 00:29:55,926
-Oh I don't know
-Can I see your identity card,please?

417
00:30:08,177 --> 00:30:09,573
That's all right thank you

418
00:30:15,142 --> 00:30:16,485
-Bert!
-Hello

419
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,490
Come up here a minute

420
00:30:18,628 --> 00:30:20,608
-What's the matter?
-I want to show you something

421
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:24,531
Look

422
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:29,777
-Where did that spring from?
-The bridge as we come under it

423
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:31,524
I heard something fall and found it

424
00:30:31,562 --> 00:30:33,182
They're looking for the gun,aren't they?

425
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:34,479
It says so in today's papers

426
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:37,167
-That's the one-God..
-Don't touch it

427
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:38,531
Leave that for the police

428
00:30:38,535 --> 00:30:40,916
Ain't you ever heard of such
 things as fingerprints?

429
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:44,692
Oh,cut him! Who's been filling
 you up with that stuff?

430
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:48,860
A gentleman by the name of Dick Thorton(?)

431
00:30:54,531 --> 00:30:56,167
Gone it's at the bottom of the river

432
00:30:56,235 --> 00:30:58,163
-I had a little trouble with a policeman
-What?

433
00:30:58,263 --> 00:31:00,083
Nothing serious luckily he didn't

434
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:01,108
see me drop it over

435
00:31:01,177 --> 00:31:03,424
-He thought I was going to throw myself
-What did he do?

436
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:05,214
Not much just had a 
look at my identity card

437
00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:07,033
-Suppose he makes a report?
-Why should he?

438
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:08,136
I wasn't doing anything

439
00:31:08,136 --> 00:31:11,149
The second time you've been in contact
with the police through me isn't it?

440
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,622
But I told you he didn't see
me drop the revolver I'm sure

441
00:31:13,682 --> 00:31:14,729
OK may be not

442
00:31:14,754 --> 00:31:17,378
He thought you were going throw yourself
in and he's got your name and address

443
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:18,936
And last night they searched that address

444
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:20,440
because they thought you might be hiding me

445
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:21,850
Well they've only got to get those two
 things connected up somehow and they

446
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,243
want to know more about you

447
00:31:23,243 --> 00:31:26,357
They'll come here again
I've got to get out of here now

448
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,708
For your sake you must see that

449
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:32,049
-Perhaps you're right
-I know I'm right

450
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:34,569
Look I got a little money
saved from my pension

451
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:36,372
Not much but enough to last you

452
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:38,075
for quite a while and I know somewhere

453
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:39,959
you can go somewhere on the coast we'll

454
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:41,789
be perfectly safe once
you get away from this place

455
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:42,963
I can give you a change of

456
00:31:43,063 --> 00:31:44,139
clothes and everything

457
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:45,988
my husband's things are still here

458
00:31:46,088 --> 00:31:48,412
I'll phone and fix it in the
morning what do you say?

459
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:52,613
What can I say

460
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:58,288
-Why not try saying yes
-I can't take your money

461
00:31:58,378 --> 00:32:00,921
You are only alone until you
get yourself straightened out

462
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:02,688
I can never really do that you know

463
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:05,281
Yes you can listen

464
00:32:05,281 --> 00:32:07,080
Tomorrow's my Saturday half-day

465
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,796
We'll take a chance on
 getting away after dark

466
00:32:09,876 --> 00:32:11,538
I'll come down with you stay over Sunday

467
00:32:11,637 --> 00:32:12,982
That'll give us the whole day in

468
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,722
the fresh air to discuss things properly

469
00:32:16,704 --> 00:32:18,347
Why are you doing all this for me?

470
00:32:19,684 --> 00:32:21,089
I told you last night

471
00:32:21,952 --> 00:32:22,979
I don't know

472
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:34,372
-Good Morning
-Good Morning,Rosa

473
00:32:34,628 --> 00:32:35,976
-May I use your phone?
-Certainly

474
00:32:42,108 --> 00:32:43,810
-Good Morning Mr Sweeney
-Good Morning,Sir

475
00:32:44,677 --> 00:32:46,650
You're the chap that
found this gun aren't you?

476
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:47,827
That's right,Sir

477
00:32:47,927 --> 00:32:49,388
It fell off of Waterloo Bridge just

478
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,512
Exactly I'm afraid I got a
disappointment for you

479
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:53,828
This revolver is the same
type as the murder weapon

480
00:32:53,828 --> 00:32:55,334
but it wasn't one that fired the shot

481
00:32:55,872 --> 00:32:57,501
However it might belong to one
of the other two gunmen involved

482
00:32:57,598 --> 00:32:58,629
we can't tell you

483
00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:01,119
Lucky my mate didn't mess
 up with the fingerprints,isn't it?

484
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,749
There were no fingerprints

485
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:06,642
However thanks for your cooperation
we let you if we want you again

486
00:33:06,842 --> 00:33:09,729
-Is that all?
-Yes,that's all,thank you

487
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:12,069
Unless you have a guilty conscience

488
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:14,144
-Good morning
-Good morning

489
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:15,829
Pity about them fingerprints

490
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:16,865
You are telling us

491
00:33:18,674 --> 00:33:19,834
He didn't seem to want to go

492
00:33:20,035 --> 00:33:22,851
-Perhaps he likes it here, well?
-Nothing

493
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,393
-No trace of the man at all?
-No none at all

494
00:33:26,981 --> 00:33:29,893
Can't understand it? What is he?
 Another Houdini

495
00:33:31,894 --> 00:33:33,520
Look,this is ridiculous

496
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,220
A man can't just run down a street and

497
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,429
disappear he's still in that district

498
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:38,880
I'll stake my bottom dollar on that

499
00:33:39,873 --> 00:33:40,873
Lawson

500
00:33:41,397 --> 00:33:44,050
You do the rounds at
 the cafÃ©s again tonight

501
00:33:44,076 --> 00:33:45,619
Take every man you can lay your
hands on them and do the job thoroughly

502
00:33:45,877 --> 00:33:47,417
-Very good Sir
-When somebody's hiding

503
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:48,572
got to eat somewhere

504
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:53,754
I want that man he's our one and
only lead and he's not going to get away

505
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,360
A shilling

506
00:35:09,744 --> 00:35:11,551
Who's the driver's cab BLF 405?

507
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:13,546
I am why?

508
00:35:14,056 --> 00:35:15,944
We have our own car to pick you up

509
00:35:15,944 --> 00:35:18,050
-What for?
-They want a word with you at the Yard

510
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,603
-What me?
-Yes you

511
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,621
-What about?
-You'll find out when you get there

512
00:35:22,275 --> 00:35:24,740
-What about my supper is pie
-Come on get a move on

513
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,742
We can't wait all night

514
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,184
Well I'm going down old Compton Street

515
00:35:40,384 --> 00:35:41,792
when this woman nails me

516
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:42,795
Hop in lady says

517
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,107
-anywhere you like
-You slay me

518
00:35:45,107 --> 00:35:49,010
-Where did you take her Blackpool?
-She wanted to go Victoria Station

519
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,482
But had to pick up someone first

520
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,570
And Victoria's where I dropped them

521
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,226
You can't tell us what he looked like

522
00:35:54,226 --> 00:35:56,534
She paid the fare the
bloke I hardly so at all

523
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:57,907
Where were they going do you know?

524
00:35:58,282 --> 00:35:59,794
I haven't the faintest idea

525
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:00,896
Is that all?

526
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:03,764
Then went straight back to
 the shelter and ordered me supper

527
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:06,632
And I'd very much like to
go back to it if you don't mind

528
00:36:07,494 --> 00:36:08,870
All right you can

529
00:36:12,085 --> 00:36:13,657
And how may I ask am I to get there?

530
00:36:13,657 --> 00:36:16,672
What's the matter with the taxi

531
00:36:20,455 --> 00:36:21,456
He was a great help

532
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,383
I don't know three men killed one of our

533
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:26,263
chaps in broad daylight and where are we

534
00:36:26,263 --> 00:36:28,602
Nowhere even though we've caught up with

535
00:36:28,602 --> 00:36:30,612
one of them he runs down
 a street and disappears

536
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,257
No it's not good enough those

537
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:35,410
baskets had all the luck so far

538
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,168
What about this man the
Adams girl went to Victoria with,Sir?

539
00:36:38,268 --> 00:36:39,918
Probably nothing in it at all

540
00:36:40,018 --> 00:36:41,052
Look

541
00:36:41,053 --> 00:36:44,223
There was no one with her in the flat
that night that chap got away was there?

542
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:45,899
-No
-In fact that lets her out

543
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:47,992
That bloke tonight could have been anybody

544
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:50,114
How about boyfriends I know the district

545
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:51,975
Married man probably

546
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:55,193
-Still we'll see
-She didn't look that type to me,Sir

547
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:59,096
Lawson I envy you,you
got a very beautiful mind

548
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,602
-Good morning
-Oh hello

549
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:47,126
How would you like a swim?
 I think I can borrow some things

550
00:37:49,974 --> 00:37:51,028
Nothing I'd like better

551
00:37:51,424 --> 00:37:53,329
-I'll see what I can do
-All right

552
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:56,290
That's the first time I've seen you smile

553
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:19,863
-Enjoy your swim?
-Wonderful

554
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:23,089
-Your name is Peter isn't it?
-That's right

555
00:38:23,189 --> 00:38:24,484
-My name is May
-Where is Andy?

556
00:38:24,584 --> 00:38:27,701
Stealing the ticket(?), oh it
is nice to see you again Jean

557
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:29,171
I must sit down have a chat

558
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:30,434
I shouldn't really of course

559
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,399
I'm supposed to be doing
the books this morning

560
00:38:32,499 --> 00:38:34,282
There's always something
to be done in a Pub

561
00:38:34,282 --> 00:38:36,277
-I know
-You were in this line too?

562
00:38:36,277 --> 00:38:39,117
I was,are you very busy
this time of the year?

563
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:40,414
Doesn't make much difference

564
00:38:40,415 --> 00:38:42,589
really customers are
 a bit thirsty I suppose

565
00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:44,027
Only a local chain(?)you know

566
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,089
We only got the two rooms you are in
 anyway and they are hardly ever let

567
00:38:47,189 --> 00:38:48,708
Too quiet for most people

568
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:49,736
What are you going to do?

569
00:38:49,736 --> 00:38:52,308
Perhaps you like the sea
without trimmings like this place

570
00:38:52,308 --> 00:38:54,266
Get's on my nerves sometimes

571
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:55,963
-Good morning
-Good morning Andy

572
00:38:56,694 --> 00:38:57,824
Can you speed the pop Mary

573
00:38:57,916 --> 00:39:00,458
-Pop that is coming
-You don't mind do you Jean?

574
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,630
-You're the governor
-I sometimes wonder

575
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:05,455
What's going in town now Jean?

576
00:39:05,455 --> 00:39:07,746
-Go and see any of the old gang?
-No,not now

577
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,263
What do you do with yourself then?

578
00:39:09,586 --> 00:39:11,684
My job keeps pretty busy for one thing

579
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:13,504
Well I find plenty to do

580
00:39:13,504 --> 00:39:15,525
What do you think of this
 Golden street shooting ?

581
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:17,235
I don't know what things are coming to

582
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:19,540
They pull a gun on you as
soon as look at you nowadays

583
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,990
It's all these ruddy deserters
 that's what it is

584
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,366
Anything about on the wireless?

585
00:39:23,366 --> 00:39:24,929
Not much they're still looking

586
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,864
for the chap they nearly
 caught the other night

587
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:29,630
Why on earth they don't publish a
 description of him I don't know

588
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:31,377
You ever miss the band business Mr Baker?

589
00:39:31,377 --> 00:39:35,258
Yes and no sometimes I think
 I'd like to go back to it

590
00:39:35,258 --> 00:39:36,996
But not on the trombone,mind you

591
00:39:36,996 --> 00:39:38,879
Band my own the next time

592
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,848
I'd make a good conductor you know

593
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:42,653
You certainly would on a bus

594
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:45,079
You have to say things like that

595
00:39:50,894 --> 00:39:52,268
Why don't you try to relax

596
00:39:52,368 --> 00:39:53,449
I can't

597
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:55,125
Look at that incident at breakfast these

598
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,353
things with me all the time

599
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:58,419
Yes,I can see that

600
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,584
Jean,do you know how
many deserters there are?

601
00:40:07,162 --> 00:40:08,683
Nearly 20,000

602
00:40:09,148 --> 00:40:11,678
 20,000 men on the run all
over the country

603
00:40:12,862 --> 00:40:14,552
men with no hope and
no future

604
00:40:14,552 --> 00:40:17,116
They say they should like to give
 themselves up and go to jail

605
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,390
That's just what they won't do

606
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,010
instead of thinking they will

607
00:40:21,198 --> 00:40:22,788
They all had some reason for deserting

608
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,705
Human nature is human nature all world over

609
00:40:26,435 --> 00:40:28,963
That's what the authorities
won't make allowances for

610
00:40:31,152 --> 00:40:33,106
If those men were allowed to start afresh

611
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:34,543
From the clean slate it all become

612
00:40:34,543 --> 00:40:36,033
useful members of the community again

613
00:40:37,293 --> 00:40:39,049
As it is most of them are forced to live by

614
00:40:39,249 --> 00:40:44,497
crime,crime of every sort including murder

615
00:40:46,438 --> 00:40:47,641
Now that's what I wanted for

616
00:40:51,204 --> 00:40:53,837
Peter I was wondering if ever you find

617
00:40:53,837 --> 00:40:55,871
this man, the man you want, what exactly

618
00:40:55,971 --> 00:40:56,976
would you do?

619
00:40:56,977 --> 00:40:59,039
Make him talk and he would

620
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,094
How do you know?

621
00:41:00,094 --> 00:41:02,440
Because he's not the man who
fired the shot and I know it

622
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,642
He'd soon open up to try
and save his own skin

623
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,485
And I'd hand him over and make him clear me

624
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:11,174
You mean you'd hand him over to the police?

625
00:41:11,174 --> 00:41:14,111
-Yes,
-And yourself too?

626
00:41:17,636 --> 00:41:18,749
Yes I suppose so I have to

627
00:41:19,956 --> 00:41:21,260
Then you'd be free wouldn't you?

628
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,029
Free to start again,that's what you really
 want isn't it to start all over again

629
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,631
There's no use talking like
 this I shall never find him

630
00:41:29,831 --> 00:41:30,838
it's impossible

631
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:33,704
You got to somehow,Peter,you just got to

632
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,529
What do you make of
Jean and her boyfriend,May?

633
00:41:40,524 --> 00:41:43,500
-What do you mean what I make them?
-I mean,do you think they're in love?

634
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,169
What do you think come
down here for if they are not?

635
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:48,374
The best thing that could
 have happened to Jean

636
00:41:48,474 --> 00:41:50,178
She's been alone far too long

637
00:41:50,178 --> 00:41:52,099
That's natural whatever she thinks

638
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:54,908
it's no use caring ??around
her for the rest of her life

639
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:57,801
She's a good kid I'd do anything for Jean

640
00:41:58,428 --> 00:42:00,407
High time she had some
happiness for a change

641
00:42:00,407 --> 00:42:04,135
I'm not arguing I just thought they
 looked a little on edge that's all

642
00:42:04,135 --> 00:42:06,761
Wouldn't you'll be in the
 same circumstances?

643
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:08,828
Oh I see what you mean

644
00:42:10,437 --> 00:42:11,753
Nothing of the sort

645
00:42:12,808 --> 00:42:14,435
The trouble with you is you judge other

646
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:17,226
people by your own low standards

647
00:42:17,226 --> 00:42:19,541
That's because you used to do
 that sort of thing yourself

648
00:42:20,491 --> 00:42:22,107
Well you ought to know

649
00:42:32,245 --> 00:42:34,190
I shall have to leave early
 in the morning,Peter

650
00:42:34,391 --> 00:42:36,414
I've got to go home
change before I go to work

651
00:42:37,225 --> 00:42:39,887
I hate leaving at all but here you are

652
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:43,913
-When are you coming back?
-Saturday do you want me to?

653
00:42:43,913 --> 00:42:45,592
You know I do

654
00:42:46,893 --> 00:42:48,332
I feel almost human again

655
00:42:48,939 --> 00:42:53,328
You and this place I'd almost
 forgotten the reason I'm here

656
00:42:57,438 --> 00:42:58,566
You've been wonderful,Jean

657
00:42:59,324 --> 00:43:01,082
I don't know what I'd have done without you

658
00:43:01,768 --> 00:43:02,862
Or what I do now

659
00:43:14,488 --> 00:43:16,209
-Jean
-Yes

660
00:43:17,066 --> 00:43:18,143
It happened didn't it?

661
00:43:20,771 --> 00:43:21,927
Yes

662
00:43:29,214 --> 00:43:31,503
-When did you know?
-Today earlier on

663
00:43:32,938 --> 00:43:35,264
What are we going to do,
there's no future for you with me

664
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:37,087
-Yes there is
-No,not as I am now

665
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,396
We're not going to give up

666
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:39,889
Where is it all going to end

667
00:43:40,969 --> 00:43:42,661
We'll find a way out somehow

668
00:44:24,385 --> 00:44:27,788
Good morning Mrs. Adams I'm a
police officer perhaps you remember me?

669
00:44:27,788 --> 00:44:30,443
-Yes I think I do
-Do you mind if I came in a moment?

670
00:44:30,443 --> 00:44:32,421
I'd like to ask you a few questions

671
00:44:34,442 --> 00:44:35,855
No,not at all?

672
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:46,136
Now Mrs Adams we're very interested in

673
00:44:46,136 --> 00:44:47,632
the man you went to Victoria Station

674
00:44:47,632 --> 00:44:48,669
with on Saturday night

675
00:44:48,669 --> 00:44:50,938
I've been being watched then?

676
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:54,318
We're making a note of anything
unusual that happens around here just now

677
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:56,975
What's so unusual about a
 man leaving a woman's flat?

678
00:44:57,272 --> 00:45:00,066
In the ordinary way nothing but this particular man

679
00:45:00,066 --> 00:45:01,594
didn't want to be seen leaving that's

680
00:45:01,694 --> 00:45:03,411
all so we found the taxi and checked up

681
00:45:03,411 --> 00:45:05,510
on you who was he?

682
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,139
-A friend
-What was his name?

683
00:45:08,453 --> 00:45:10,198
-Brian?
-Brian what?

684
00:45:10,198 --> 00:45:12,310
I think it was Parkson

685
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,555
-You just think?
-I only met him that night

686
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:16,526
-Yet you brought him back here?
-Yes

687
00:45:16,526 --> 00:45:18,310
I brought him back for a drink

688
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:19,310
I see

689
00:45:20,737 --> 00:45:21,771
What was he like?

690
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:27,413
Medium built dark curly
 hair and a thin face

691
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:30,819
Why did you go to Victoria with him?

692
00:45:30,918 --> 00:45:32,390
I didn't,he came with me

693
00:45:32,456 --> 00:45:33,798
I just gave him a lift that's all

694
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,875
Where'd he went after I
left him I had no idea

695
00:45:36,978 --> 00:45:39,053
You mean you were the
one going to the station?

696
00:45:39,485 --> 00:45:40,886
Yes that's right

697
00:45:40,919 --> 00:45:42,859
But he went into the station
 with you didn't he?

698
00:45:42,959 --> 00:45:48,333
Yes,yes of course he did he came in with me

699
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:49,749
but I left him going to the bar

700
00:45:49,749 --> 00:45:52,704
-Where he went after that
-You've no idea I know

701
00:45:52,704 --> 00:45:55,496
You've told me and where did you go?

702
00:45:57,646 --> 00:45:59,224
-Away for the weekend
-On your own?

703
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:01,943
-Yes,I was alone
-Where?

704
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:05,319
And I must warn you Mrs Adams,
you'd better tell the truth

705
00:46:06,425 --> 00:46:08,020
If you don't we'll soon know

706
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,629
And that means that I should
have to come and call on you again

707
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:15,535
-The anchor Hotel Felty in Sussex
-Thank you

708
00:46:20,689 --> 00:46:23,854
About this man again you're
sure he is what you say he was?

709
00:46:23,854 --> 00:46:25,645
Someone you met casually that night

710
00:46:25,645 --> 00:46:27,002
and brought up here

711
00:46:27,002 --> 00:46:29,700
Yes,not against the law is it?

712
00:46:30,509 --> 00:46:32,824
No but you surprised me,Mrs. Adams

713
00:46:33,743 --> 00:46:34,984
I'd never have believed it

714
00:46:35,315 --> 00:46:37,331
Appearances are often deceptive,
you know,Inspector

715
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,603
Sergeant

716
00:47:23,878 --> 00:47:25,875
Some kids have found a gun
in the mud at Wapping

717
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:28,572
Another Enfield 38 having it tested now

718
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,797
This time we may have got
something,what's your news?

719
00:47:30,813 --> 00:47:33,030
Only the Adams girls ,Sir,according to

720
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:34,504
her you were right she swear she was

721
00:47:34,504 --> 00:47:36,310
only giving someone a lift someone's had

722
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,907
just met them taking back
 with her for a drink

723
00:47:40,595 --> 00:47:41,980
All right there's no need to look

724
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,769
-so depressed about it
-It's not that,Sir

725
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:45,153
It's just that I don't believe it

726
00:47:45,197 --> 00:47:46,564
Where were she over the weekend?

727
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:47,908
Sussex the Anchor hotel Fithy

728
00:47:48,008 --> 00:47:49,106
-Alone?
-So she says

729
00:47:49,108 --> 00:47:51,125
I'm going to get the local
police to check-up on it

730
00:47:51,233 --> 00:47:52,233
OK

731
00:47:53,883 --> 00:47:55,743
-Telephone?
-Of course,of course

732
00:48:09,605 --> 00:48:11,943
Peter,you're wanted on the phone

733
00:48:12,262 --> 00:48:14,687
-It's Jean
-Coming

734
00:48:31,592 --> 00:48:32,691
Hello Jean

735
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:35,470
Something has happened you
must come away from there at once

736
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:36,760
We have to find somewhere else

737
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:40,045
Anywhere I'll meet you don't
stay in that place a minute longer

738
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:42,559
Take the first train to
town and I'll meet in the lounge hall

739
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:46,018
Better still I'll skip the shop
and wait for you some where

740
00:48:46,018 --> 00:48:47,394
Where can we make it?

741
00:48:47,421 --> 00:48:48,425
Have you any suggestions?

742
00:48:48,449 --> 00:48:49,834
Wait a minute I'm trying to think

743
00:48:51,216 --> 00:48:53,676
How about the Victorian Albert
Museum on the ground floor

744
00:48:53,676 --> 00:48:55,352
where the Elizabethan things are you know

745
00:48:55,452 --> 00:48:56,454
Yes, that'll do

746
00:48:56,554 --> 00:48:58,353
Only Peter they maybe watching Victoria

747
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:01,297
Get out at Clapham Junction and
come the rest of the way by bus

748
00:49:01,297 --> 00:49:03,735
All right,I'll be as quick as I can

749
00:49:03,735 --> 00:49:06,518
-Good Bye
-Good Bye Peter

750
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:21,993
-Can I have some toast and coffee,Tony
-You are not going to work today?

751
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:25,937
No,not today I got to go and
see my brother in hospital

752
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,530
What's the matter with your brother?

753
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,763
Going to have an operation

754
00:49:29,763 --> 00:49:32,378
Well don't you worry
about it,he'll be all right

755
00:49:32,378 --> 00:49:35,081
They make anything work
these days and anything

756
00:50:02,215 --> 00:50:04,297
Jim this of all of those
kids picked up at Wapping

757
00:50:04,397 --> 00:50:05,502
The murder gun

758
00:50:07,044 --> 00:50:08,992
-Any fingerprints?
-Not any thing,not yet

759
00:50:09,485 --> 00:50:10,555
Not on our files

760
00:50:11,066 --> 00:50:13,358
We're getting somewhere and
 getting nowhere all the time

761
00:50:13,558 --> 00:50:15,412
It always comes round to the same thing

762
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,820
We don't pick that fellow
up soon I shall go crazy

763
00:50:20,825 --> 00:50:22,078
I've got something interesting

764
00:50:22,177 --> 00:50:23,188
What's that ?

765
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:25,412
One of the chaps E division
has made a routine report

766
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,261
About a girl he questioned
 last Friday night

767
00:50:27,261 --> 00:50:29,714
Thought she were going to
throw herself over Waterloo bridge

768
00:50:29,714 --> 00:50:32,280
-Well ?
-Was the Adams girl

769
00:50:34,472 --> 00:50:35,918
Was it by George

770
00:50:36,315 --> 00:50:37,634
What she want to do that for?

771
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,710
I know the trouble is

772
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,117
Maybe our visit the night before

773
00:50:41,217 --> 00:50:43,225
Why should that worry?
There's was no one there?

774
00:50:44,725 --> 00:50:46,459
Unless she is mixed up in this after all

775
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,073
Yes,you might have something

776
00:50:54,514 --> 00:50:56,999
Wait a minute I have got it

777
00:50:58,792 --> 00:51:00,713
That girl wasn't on that
bridge for a suicide

778
00:51:00,803 --> 00:51:02,555
She was the one who threw this over

779
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:04,965
Now we are getting somewhere

780
00:51:06,043 --> 00:51:07,419
-Pull her in
-Right

781
00:51:10,872 --> 00:51:12,600
Miss how much do I owe?

782
00:51:18,037 --> 00:51:19,088
Stopped

783
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,486
Look after Jean Adams will you let me

784
00:51:40,486 --> 00:51:41,759
know which department she's in

785
00:51:41,816 --> 00:51:43,967
I can tell you that right
 away she is in the ??

786
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,886
-??? Thanks
-She's not in this morning

787
00:51:45,886 --> 00:51:48,406
Must be sick or something

788
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:49,514
 I see

789
00:51:49,989 --> 00:51:51,792
-Hang on just in case
-Right

790
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:16,837
-What happened Jean
-??

791
00:52:17,655 --> 00:52:18,717
Pretend we look at these

792
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:22,767
Peter,they came to my 
place again this morning

793
00:52:22,767 --> 00:52:24,971
-How on earth
-They saw us leave on Saturday

794
00:52:25,356 --> 00:52:27,125
They know I went to Victoria with someone

795
00:52:27,126 --> 00:52:28,373
But they don't know it was you

796
00:52:28,473 --> 00:52:32,100
And they went there now making
 inquiries if I were alone that weekend

797
00:52:32,143 --> 00:52:34,739
-They should know what's all about
-Now I promise tell you later

798
00:52:34,832 --> 00:52:36,386
-Peter,there is something else
-What?

799
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,121
-I think I found him
-Who?

800
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:39,161
The man you want

801
00:52:39,161 --> 00:52:40,789
The one with Australian accent you want

802
00:52:45,357 --> 00:52:46,957
-It sounds impossible
-But it isn't

803
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,910
Luck has been against
you but I've changed it all

804
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:51,684
-Yes,if you are right
-Why isn't I?

805
00:52:51,684 --> 00:52:54,117
I would know in a second
if I could hear him myself

806
00:52:55,535 --> 00:52:56,590
Look I'll chance it

807
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:59,103
-You think he lives there?
-He opened the door with the key

808
00:52:59,114 --> 00:53:00,443
Perhaps he'll open the door to me

809
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,214
Is it to too late for you to get to work?

810
00:53:02,214 --> 00:53:04,371
All right I'll make some excuse

811
00:53:04,371 --> 00:53:05,377
Why?

812
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,363
Well I want you somewhere
 so I can telephone you

813
00:53:07,462 --> 00:53:09,206
is too risky meeting like this in daylight

814
00:53:09,206 --> 00:53:11,518
All right,Peter this may be the answer

815
00:53:11,518 --> 00:53:12,523
-to everything
-I know

816
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:15,039
-Good luck,darling
-I'll telephone you

817
00:53:15,755 --> 00:53:16,944
Let's go this way

818
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:52,039
What do you want?

819
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:54,024
I want to see Mr

820
00:53:55,045 --> 00:53:56,809
I can't remember his name the tall man who

821
00:53:56,909 --> 00:53:58,584
-lives here
-No one lives here but me

822
00:53:59,321 --> 00:54:01,120
That's not exactly true,is it?

823
00:54:07,845 --> 00:54:08,908
Who the dickens are you ?

824
00:54:11,288 --> 00:54:12,907
I think we've met before

825
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,707
In a jewellery shop,remember

826
00:54:19,775 --> 00:54:22,076
-Who is this?
-I don't know

827
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:30,378
I do

828
00:54:32,124 --> 00:54:33,689
-I know who you are
-That's right

829
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:34,907
And I know who you are

830
00:54:42,268 --> 00:54:43,558
Just a moment Mrs. Adams

831
00:54:45,185 --> 00:54:48,414
-I must ask you to come along with me
-What for?

832
00:54:48,414 --> 00:54:50,242
You're wanted for further questioning

833
00:54:50,777 --> 00:54:52,520
In connection with a murder of a policeman

834
00:55:32,468 --> 00:55:34,708
Now Mrs. Adams we paid a visit to your

835
00:55:34,808 --> 00:55:36,757
place this morning we
found these clothes there

836
00:55:36,758 --> 00:55:38,014
Whose are they ?

837
00:55:38,303 --> 00:55:41,368
They belong to my husband
there are a lot of these things there

838
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,564
Mrs Adams you're not

839
00:55:44,664 --> 00:55:45,717
being honest to this

840
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:48,793
These clothes was found in a
 corner behind a curtain in your room

841
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:50,766
That is exactly the same as those

842
00:55:50,865 --> 00:55:51,986
worn by the man we are after

843
00:55:51,986 --> 00:55:53,725
The man who run out of that pub on Thursday

844
00:55:53,824 --> 00:55:54,862
The day of the murder

845
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:59,716
He was in your flat that night when
 we were searching after all wasn't he?

846
00:56:00,884 --> 00:56:03,176
You hid him and you threw his gun over

847
00:56:03,176 --> 00:56:04,298
Waterloo Bridge didn't you?

848
00:56:07,569 --> 00:56:10,358
Look Mrs Adams why don't you
be sensible and make

849
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:11,766
things easier to yourself

850
00:56:11,766 --> 00:56:13,517
We want that man and we mean to get him

851
00:56:13,517 --> 00:56:15,470
He's a dangerous gunman
and he's concerned in

852
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:16,670
the murder of a policeman

853
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:18,922
He's not a gunman and he's
 not concerned in a murder

854
00:56:18,922 --> 00:56:20,150
So you do know him?

855
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:24,609
Well supposing you tell us
what he is concerned in and

856
00:56:24,609 --> 00:56:26,221
exactly where you come into the picture

857
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:31,127
He's concerned in clearing
himself and I'm helping him

858
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:33,380
This is interesting Mrs Adams

859
00:56:34,339 --> 00:56:35,367
Who is he?

860
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:38,864
-A deserter
-That doesn't surprise me

861
00:56:38,864 --> 00:56:41,813
But he's done for your service
that's all forgotten of course

862
00:56:41,963 --> 00:56:43,123
Only you want to do now

863
00:56:43,194 --> 00:56:44,292
is put him in prison

864
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,387
That's hardly the point

865
00:56:45,439 --> 00:56:47,428
We're interested in his
connection with a murder

866
00:56:47,528 --> 00:56:48,968
He had no connection with it at all

867
00:56:49,068 --> 00:56:51,318
He went into the jeweller
to sell that revolver

868
00:56:51,318 --> 00:56:52,670
He took the gun out of his pocket

869
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:53,960
There was a hold-up

870
00:56:54,207 --> 00:56:56,194
I see,go on

871
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:58,072
You know what happened then

872
00:56:58,072 --> 00:56:59,349
Why didn't he come to us?

873
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:00,649
How could he in his position

874
00:57:00,649 --> 00:57:02,146
would you believed him anyway?

875
00:57:02,146 --> 00:57:05,417
No his only chance was to
 find those two men himself

876
00:57:05,417 --> 00:57:08,564
And I think we have found one of them,today

877
00:57:43,366 --> 00:57:45,481
-Who's in this house?
-What's that to do with you?

878
00:57:45,481 --> 00:57:46,895
Come along we are police officers

879
00:57:46,994 --> 00:57:48,475
-Who's in this house?
-Only me

880
00:57:48,475 --> 00:57:50,113
We'll see about that

881
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:56,175
Go on up you go

882
00:58:09,797 --> 00:58:11,605
Nothing upstairs only the men's clothes

883
00:58:13,717 --> 00:58:15,846
-Well,where are they?
-You've not right to come here

884
00:58:15,946 --> 00:58:18,206
Don't start that where are
these two gentlemen friends

885
00:58:18,206 --> 00:58:21,510
-You've been entertaining here
-What do you mean?Entertaining

886
00:58:22,314 --> 00:58:24,313
I'll give you two guesses I want to know

887
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:25,710
where they are and who they are

888
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,443
I don't know what you're talking about

889
00:58:35,024 --> 00:58:37,237
-What's your name?
-Lily

890
00:58:37,524 --> 00:58:38,524
Lily what?

891
00:58:39,597 --> 00:58:40,620
Lily Gatehouse

892
00:58:41,845 --> 00:58:43,516
Lily you are a smart girl I can see that

893
00:58:43,516 --> 00:58:45,329
You know the answers don't you?

894
00:58:45,329 --> 00:58:47,141
I wonder if you know the answer to this one

895
00:58:47,141 --> 00:58:49,042
We're looking for two men

896
00:58:49,042 --> 00:58:51,394
One of them may have two
fingers missing on his left hand

897
00:58:53,437 --> 00:58:54,571
These two men are wanted in

898
00:58:54,571 --> 00:58:56,284
connection with the murder of a policeman

899
00:58:56,851 --> 00:58:58,560
We shall get him in the end,you know Lily

900
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,400
Make no mistake about that

901
00:59:02,443 --> 00:59:06,006
 and afterwards we find out
that you've been shielding them

902
00:59:06,006 --> 00:59:07,930
That's puts you in it,doesn't it?

903
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:09,733
And we should come back for you

904
00:59:09,733 --> 00:59:11,631
on a murder charge

905
00:59:14,388 --> 00:59:16,897
So Lily you're the smart
 girl I think you are

906
00:59:17,078 --> 00:59:18,784
You got something to tell us haven't you?

907
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:26,092
All right

908
00:59:26,364 --> 00:59:28,318
Good well who are they?

909
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:30,612
-Two deserters
-Names?

910
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:33,345
The one with the fingers
shot off is called Slim

911
00:59:33,345 --> 00:59:34,945
-Slim what?
-Slim Elfey

912
00:59:35,313 --> 00:59:37,492
-Australian?
-No but he lived there for years

913
00:59:37,492 --> 00:59:39,990
-The other one?
-Dan

914
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:42,204
-Dan Underwood
-How long have they been here?

915
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,418
Some months now

916
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:45,255
But I had no idea that

917
00:59:45,255 --> 00:59:47,261
they'd anything to do with
 the shooting I swear it

918
00:59:47,261 --> 00:59:48,380
Not until the man

919
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,482
who was at jeweller's shop

920
00:59:49,582 --> 00:59:51,325
What man? We are waiting to hear about him

921
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,054
That man who came to see them

922
00:59:55,054 --> 00:59:58,082
-What did he look like?
-Medium build fresh complexion?

923
00:59:58,082 --> 00:59:59,888
Brown hair,blue eyes is that the man?

924
00:59:59,988 --> 01:00:01,073
Yes I think so

925
01:00:01,173 --> 01:00:02,893
Well what did they talk about ?

926
01:00:02,893 --> 01:00:03,893
I don't know

927
01:00:05,609 --> 01:00:06,803
They sent me out of the room

928
01:00:07,881 --> 01:00:08,979
Where are they now?

929
01:00:09,994 --> 01:00:11,464
They went off with him in a car

930
01:00:11,464 --> 01:00:14,044
Did he go willingly or did
 they perhaps persuaded

931
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:15,077
at the point of a gun

932
01:00:16,203 --> 01:00:19,383
-Slim persuaded him
-Where do they go to?

933
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:21,578
-I don't know
-Where did they get the car?

934
01:00:21,578 --> 01:00:23,102
-Pinched it
-Where from?

935
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,434
I don't know,honestly I don't

936
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,263
Somewhere around here I think

937
01:00:28,961 --> 01:00:30,033
Very useful

938
01:00:31,501 --> 01:00:32,912
All right that'll do for now

939
01:00:34,022 --> 01:00:35,646
Take her away

940
01:00:37,943 --> 01:00:39,925
It looks to be something in
 your story,Mrs. Adams

941
01:00:40,466 --> 01:00:42,126
I'm afraid they've got your friend Burden

942
01:00:42,204 --> 01:00:44,089
They took him away from
 that house two of them

943
01:00:44,089 --> 01:00:45,148
In a car

944
01:00:45,744 --> 01:00:47,425
Say he walked to the car that's something

945
01:00:47,425 --> 01:00:49,177
Cut me in please?

946
01:00:49,177 --> 01:00:50,272
What are you going to do?

947
01:00:50,831 --> 01:00:53,040
We haven't finished them
 yet that car was stolen

948
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,242
Just as soon as we

949
01:00:54,342 --> 01:00:57,280
get the number we should have to
pick it up inside a quarter of an hour

950
01:00:57,330 --> 01:01:00,197
-Haven't you got its number yet then ?
-No, one they took somewhere

951
01:01:00,197 --> 01:01:01,837
outside a theatre just
after performance started

952
01:01:01,878 --> 01:01:02,890
-Theatre?
-Yes

953
01:01:02,901 --> 01:01:05,887
That gives them two hours before
the loss was discovered by then they ???

954
01:01:05,987 --> 01:01:07,615
-Take it down to records,please
-Yes,Sir

955
01:01:07,633 --> 01:01:09,676
There isn't a theatre open
this time in the morning

956
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:10,895
There must be

957
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,719
-Stop,they wouldn't dare to risk anything else
-Which one?

958
01:01:12,998 --> 01:01:14,627
That's just what we are finding out now

959
01:01:22,732 --> 01:01:25,066
I bid you to have to interrupt the 
picture and make an announcement?

960
01:01:25,129 --> 01:01:27,552
-What's the trouble
-We want to know if a car has been stolen

961
01:01:27,552 --> 01:01:28,626
from outside this teller

962
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:31,497
get everyone who's parked their 
car outside to come out here at once

963
01:01:31,576 --> 01:01:35,031
Hello cars from information
 room message number 43

964
01:01:35,031 --> 01:01:37,665
Stolen black Austin saloon

965
01:01:37,665 --> 01:01:41,821
Index number MML eight seven four

966
01:01:42,542 --> 01:01:45,823
Outside Cambridge Theatre Durham Street WC2

967
01:01:45,823 --> 01:01:48,823
Approximate time 1100 hours

968
01:01:48,823 --> 01:01:51,483
Time of origin 11:35

969
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,637
I told you last night not to 
come down here again didn't I

970
01:02:58,637 --> 01:03:00,618
-I don't want either of you
-We want him upstairs

971
01:03:00,618 --> 01:03:01,894
You know why,this is trouble

972
01:03:01,994 --> 01:03:04,504
-And I don't want any trouble 
-It isn't so much you want it what you get it

973
01:03:04,564 --> 01:03:06,654
You've done pretty well  
of chaps I got,Charlie

974
01:03:07,305 --> 01:03:08,883
You have to take the good with the bad

975
01:03:08,912 --> 01:03:09,955
How bad is it then

976
01:03:10,055 --> 01:03:12,347
This is the bloke who 
was in Collin's shop last Thursday

977
01:03:14,678 --> 01:03:17,093
Nearly an hour now we're on the right

978
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:19,054
track that car is 
being hidden somewhere

979
01:03:19,054 --> 01:03:21,098
Must have reach there 
before our message went out

980
01:03:21,619 --> 01:03:23,125
Where,that's the point

981
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:26,624
-Isn't it anything you can do? 
-Mrs. Adams

982
01:03:26,624 --> 01:03:28,705
We're doing everything we possibly can

983
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:30,914
You came in on this a little late,you know

984
01:03:31,014 --> 01:03:33,102
It wasn't our fault

985
01:03:35,138 --> 01:03:36,990
Now then between the time the car left

986
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:38,335
her house and the time it's

987
01:03:38,435 --> 01:03:40,400
description was broadcast it couldn't

988
01:03:40,459 --> 01:03:41,942
possibly get outside a radius of say

989
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,038
three miles from the cherry so to speak

990
01:03:45,352 --> 01:03:47,229
That puts it roughly somewhere here

991
01:03:50,962 --> 01:03:52,173
Wapping

992
01:03:53,802 --> 01:03:55,951
That's where those kids
 found that revolver,isn't it?

993
01:04:18,723 --> 01:04:20,623
I can't have you three hanging around here

994
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:23,343
-I'll tell you I can't have
-There won't be three after tonight

995
01:04:23,343 --> 01:04:25,777
Oh no,oh no you don't

996
01:04:25,804 --> 01:04:28,349
You thought you got rid of 
that revolver last night,didn't you?

997
01:04:28,379 --> 01:04:30,446
It was just found out there
 this morning in the mud

998
01:04:30,546 --> 01:04:32,669
They've been busy around here all day

999
01:04:32,765 --> 01:04:34,447
I'm not having any stiffs in the house

1000
01:04:34,447 --> 01:04:36,179
Why can't you leave me alone

1001
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:37,791
Can't you have other places you can go?

1002
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,033
No there aren't and you know it

1003
01:04:39,033 --> 01:04:41,505
You've taken anything we've 
brought in the past haven't you?

1004
01:04:41,505 --> 01:04:43,143
and being glad of it you'd have taken

1005
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,089
anything that was going from Collins place

1006
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:46,141
if there'd been anything

1007
01:04:46,151 --> 01:04:48,301
You're in this with us Charlie
 right up to your ears

1008
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:49,544
and make no mistake about it

1009
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,769
-stop whining and start doing something
-What can I do

1010
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:53,075
We got to get out of the country

1011
01:04:53,149 --> 01:04:55,150
You can fix it if the money's
 there we know that

1012
01:04:55,239 --> 01:04:56,750
And you've got the money haven't you?

1013
01:04:57,161 --> 01:04:58,839
sooner you get things started 
the sooner you'll get rid of us

1014
01:04:58,927 --> 01:05:01,116
How about that fellow upstairs? I'm
not having any murder done here

1015
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:03,526
We are dealing with that 
as soon as it's dark

1016
01:05:04,548 --> 01:05:06,883
-What are you going do? 
-Take him down the river

1017
01:05:06,929 --> 01:05:08,437
Hold him under for a few minutes

1018
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,966
Then let him go suicide

1019
01:05:14,135 --> 01:05:15,849
I don't like it,and how about that car?

1020
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:18,237
You got rid of plenty of others you 
can get rid of that one

1021
01:05:18,237 --> 01:05:19,800
There's nothing to connect us with it

1022
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,956
Where exactly was that revolver found?

1023
01:05:22,655 --> 01:05:25,397
Just here the children were playing there

1024
01:05:25,445 --> 01:05:27,442
at low tide and saw it's 
sticking out of the mud

1025
01:05:27,542 --> 01:05:30,800
Very well then we'll cover this 
section say from here to here

1026
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:31,956
And take one of your cars

1027
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,048
You people do the rest

1028
01:05:33,148 --> 01:05:35,469
I want every garage dock and yard in the

1029
01:05:35,469 --> 01:05:37,173
district opened and searched in that

1030
01:05:37,173 --> 01:05:38,795
any place large enough to take that car

1031
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:39,851
Right

1032
01:06:37,141 --> 01:06:38,231
Hello

1033
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,243
OK

1034
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:10,794
You're dead lucky everything's fixed

1035
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:13,608
He'll slip you on board all three
 of you and drop you off at Belfast

1036
01:07:13,608 --> 01:07:15,097
Why three of us all of us suddenly?

1037
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:16,189
Because the ship sails in

1038
01:07:16,189 --> 01:07:17,842
less than an hour you'll have to go now

1039
01:07:17,842 --> 01:07:20,047
and take that chip with 
you and alive you understand?

1040
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,883
How do you get rid of him
 afterwards is up to you

1041
01:07:22,248 --> 01:07:23,896
As long you all get out
of here I don't care

1042
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,946
But this is going to cost 
money a lot of money

1043
01:07:27,946 --> 01:07:29,603
All I can afford

1044
01:07:29,603 --> 01:07:32,315
The only thing you can afford 
Charlie is to let us down

1045
01:07:32,315 --> 01:07:33,946
And you would wouldn't you?

1046
01:07:33,946 --> 01:07:35,686
 if you thought you could get away with it

1047
01:07:35,711 --> 01:07:37,835
I wouldn't touch your yard(?)
 if there was any trouble

1048
01:07:37,935 --> 01:07:40,117
Well there isn't going to be
any trouble so that's that

1049
01:07:40,117 --> 01:07:41,249
You can get rid of this

1050
01:07:41,249 --> 01:07:42,758
bloke(?) over the side that is if your

1051
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:44,959
girl(?) has given away(?) and
they are on the way in the morning

1052
01:07:45,025 --> 01:07:46,939
He wont know anything
 as long as he is paid

1053
01:07:46,939 --> 01:07:48,921
And you are going 
to pay him,aren't you,Charlie?

1054
01:07:48,979 --> 01:07:50,782
So there we are they're all set

1055
01:07:51,123 --> 01:07:52,951
-How far is the ship from here?
-Not far

1056
01:07:52,979 --> 01:07:54,960
OK come on let's get him

1057
01:08:07,018 --> 01:08:08,100
He must have jumped out

1058
01:08:12,292 --> 01:08:13,355
He's gone away all right

1059
01:08:22,136 --> 01:08:23,937
-He's gone 
-Never mind about that,look

1060
01:08:32,387 --> 01:08:34,719
They're searching the street 
they're looking for something

1061
01:08:35,619 --> 01:08:36,705
I know what it is

1062
01:08:36,805 --> 01:08:38,636
It's the car your rotten liars you told

1063
01:08:38,636 --> 01:08:40,129
me they couldn't connect you with it

1064
01:08:40,224 --> 01:08:42,316
Those are not local men 
there must be Scotland Yard

1065
01:08:42,316 --> 01:08:43,322
What are we going to do

1066
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,478
You mean what are you
 going to do don't you,Charlie?

1067
01:09:00,024 --> 01:09:01,051
Everything around for now(?)

1068
01:09:44,478 --> 01:09:45,589
This is it

1069
01:10:33,281 --> 01:10:35,043
He won't tell us anything 
now or any other time

1070
01:10:38,565 --> 01:10:40,746
The landlord can have 
been dead a few minutes

1071
01:11:00,809 --> 01:11:01,906
They've got away

1072
01:11:03,738 --> 01:11:05,156
Not with our launch out at that end

1073
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,671
Adams

1074
01:11:17,028 --> 01:11:18,785
That fellow Burden got 
about the way though

1075
01:11:19,747 --> 01:11:23,854
Earlier or else he had it too

1076
01:11:25,774 --> 01:11:26,851
Jim

1077
01:11:26,851 --> 01:11:28,814
Those two men are still here there's no

1078
01:11:28,814 --> 01:11:30,310
way onto the roof they must be

1079
01:11:31,151 --> 01:11:34,067
They shut the landlord's mouth 
now they think they are OK

1080
01:11:35,949 --> 01:11:37,042
We'll see

1081
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:02,180
Car is here and so the culprits(?)

1082
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:04,130
If they to try to get 
out you know what to do

1083
01:12:07,338 --> 01:12:10,035
Listen everybody we're from Scotland Yard

1084
01:12:10,035 --> 01:12:11,304
This is a check-up

1085
01:12:11,304 --> 01:12:13,366
Nobody's allowed to leave

1086
01:12:13,526 --> 01:12:16,909
Anybody thinks of trying as well,I'll tell 
you I got an armed police officer outside

1087
01:12:17,313 --> 01:12:19,173
All right stay where you are everybody

1088
01:13:08,076 --> 01:13:09,524
Pull out your left hand

1089
01:13:12,903 --> 01:13:13,903
Stop that

1090
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:19,768
You won't get away 
with this you now

1091
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:22,665
Get over there,you too

1092
01:13:33,744 --> 01:13:35,187
Not too much of a ? to come after us

1093
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:41,776
Look there

1094
01:14:15,376 --> 01:14:16,391
That's that

1095
01:14:17,664 --> 01:14:19,157
All we want now is fingerprints

1096
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:27,596
Take him away send for an ambulance

1097
01:14:34,481 --> 01:14:35,515
How are you feeling?

1098
01:14:35,515 --> 01:14:38,320
I'll be all right I didn't know you

1099
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,229
people were here I heard the tail end of it

1100
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:41,321
from in there

1101
01:14:42,314 --> 01:14:45,190
I was after those two 
myself but I missed out

1102
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:47,839
No,no you didn't,we're talking 
about Golden street

1103
01:14:47,839 --> 01:14:49,547
-Thank you 
-We got the murder gun

1104
01:14:49,547 --> 01:14:53,117
We got some fingerprints 
and we've got the man

1105
01:14:53,286 --> 01:14:56,425
If I'm not mistaken he's
 taking a bit lying down

1106
01:14:57,592 --> 01:14:59,119
Oh,you've been a very great help to us

1107
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,284
You're Peter Burden alias Brown aren't you

1108
01:15:02,284 --> 01:15:04,894
deserter ?
-Yes

1109
01:15:06,932 --> 01:15:09,916
-How did you know..
-Some just told us quite a lot about you

1110
01:15:27,104 --> 01:15:29,028
-That's all it is inspector ?
-Yes I think so,Sir

1111
01:15:29,128 --> 01:15:32,410
-Except that 
-Yes

1112
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:35,003
Well,Sir,I would like to say that

1113
01:15:38,028 --> 01:15:39,204
Perhaps not my business

1114
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:41,854
-Cpt Willerby
-No questions,Sir

1115
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:44,370
That'll be all,thank you,Inspector

1116
01:15:58,259 --> 01:16:00,159
As has been brought to 
the notice of the court

1117
01:16:00,734 --> 01:16:02,241
by the civil authorities the part you

1118
01:16:02,241 --> 01:16:03,684
have played in bringing to justice

1119
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:04,716
certain criminals

1120
01:16:05,218 --> 01:16:06,787
At no inconsiderable risk to

1121
01:16:06,787 --> 01:16:09,554
yourself whilst taking this into

1122
01:16:09,554 --> 01:16:11,767
consideration however together with your

1123
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:14,306
excellent war record we have to inform

1124
01:16:14,306 --> 01:16:16,583
you that neither of these facts in any

1125
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,247
way mitigates the fact that you are

1126
01:16:18,247 --> 01:16:19,808
guilty of desertion from his Majesty's

1127
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:22,547
forces or relieves you of your liability

1128
01:16:23,023 --> 01:16:25,373
to that service and the seriousness of

1129
01:16:25,373 --> 01:16:28,270
this offence must be duly
 impressed upon you

1130
01:16:51,955 --> 01:16:55,327
-Is it over 
-Yes it's all over

1131
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,318
Listen Jean I've only got a moment

1132
01:16:59,328 --> 01:17:00,957
I'm going away for about a year

1133
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,799
And it'll make everything so much easier if

1134
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:07,244
I know you'll be waiting 
and you will,won't you?

1135
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:10,820
-You know I will
-Bless you

1136
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,119
-When you'll be going?
-Now

1137
01:17:19,847 --> 01:17:22,016
It's really better like
 this isn't it,Peter?

1138
01:17:23,878 --> 01:17:26,243
Yes I suppose so this is something you

1139
01:17:26,243 --> 01:17:27,607
can never get away from

1140
01:17:29,421 --> 01:17:33,664
It's no solution to the 
problem any solution to mine

1141
01:17:36,696 --> 01:17:37,723
Now goodbye

1142
01:17:47,572 --> 01:17:49,003
Good Bye darling

1143
