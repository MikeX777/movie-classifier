1
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,062
Well? Have the four of you
brought a treasure vault?

2
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:55,113
Can't you see?
lt's a cupboard

3
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:57,797
Your master placed an order yesterday.
We're here to deliver it

4
00:02:58,128 --> 00:03:00,103
But my master has already left
for his vacations today

5
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:02,984
Anyway, bring it in.
- Move it, guys

6
00:03:04,112 --> 00:03:05,541
Come on in

7
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:10,021
One and one...

8
00:03:10,671 --> 00:03:12,581
makes eleven

9
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:18,351
one and one...

10
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,268
makes eleven...

11
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:22,501
my friend

12
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:32,741
One and one... is eleven

13
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:11,915
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten...

14
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:14,664
and one... is eleven

15
00:04:20,656 --> 00:04:23,077
One and one is never two

16
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:26,508
Those who laugh,
never cry

17
00:04:27,471 --> 00:04:30,341
Those who keep awake,
never fall asleep

18
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:33,606
Their identities,
they never lose

19
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:36,879
Wherever they find an enemy...

20
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:40,905
they deliver the punch...

21
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:44,108
my friend

22
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:48,751
One and one make eleven,
my friend

23
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:51,785
They are Tara and Sitara

24
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:56,588
Homeless orphans, driven
by poverty and despair...

25
00:04:56,975 --> 00:04:58,885
they have formed a team together

26
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,412
They have taken the words of their
foster mother very seriously

27
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,709
They believe that should
one and one come together...

28
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:08,424
they possess the power of eleven.
They then set out...

29
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:11,883
on the path of thievery and fraud.
They think they will...

30
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,852
win over this world and
carve a place of their own

31
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,829
Little did they know that there are
the worst of thieves in the world...

32
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:24,875
who are not just enemies
of society...

33
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:27,372
but of the nation
and humanity at large

34
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:35,078
An instance of this kind became the
biggest lesson for Tara and Sitara...

35
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:39,788
when they met the dreaded criminals,
Cobra and Panther

36
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,286
Sir, our soldiers are ready
to take the guns to the base

37
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:21,003
Load the guns quickly.
We've got to leave

38
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:24,262
But you have an appointment
with Mr Subramaniam at 12

39
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:28,044
Plans have changed.
For security reasons

40
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:36,614
As you know, sir, no one except you
has the permission to go inside

41
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:39,628
He's on official work
for our department

42
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,790
He's responsible for delivery
of the gun at the base

43
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,213
But orders are orders, sir

44
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:51,461
Major, the Captain is doing
his duty. Orders are orders

45
00:06:51,856 --> 00:06:54,344
You can go ahead.
l'll wait here, okay?

46
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,189
What is the matter?
- This is Dr Subramaniam's cabin, sir

47
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:29,861
While l meet Dr Subramaniam in
privacy, you will wait here

48
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,181
We need proper security
for this gun

49
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,747
We have toiled for years
to develop this gun

50
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,949
Come, let me give you
a demonstration

51
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:13,835
lt has an inbuilt sensor which detects
movements within a 10-kilometer range

52
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:23,973
Our soldiers will be greatly benefitted
in dealing with infiltrators

53
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:30,919
Because we don't want the gun to
fall in wrong hands...

54
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,181
each gun has been given
a different code-number

55
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:38,021
Without the code-number,
this gun will not function

56
00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:41,381
What is the code-number
to operate the gun?

57
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:44,268
Ml2 3853713

58
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:46,292
Thank you. Can we take the gun now?

59
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:48,908
First sign the documents

60
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:55,304
You've signed the document...

61
00:08:55,472 --> 00:08:57,861
but you haven't entered
the password of this operation?

62
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:01,258
You know very well, Ram Singh

63
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:03,941
Without the password,
you cannot take this gun away

64
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:08,424
This gun... l am surely taking away

65
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:50,021
You're here, sir?
- Where else? This is my base

66
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,231
You were in there a little while ago,
and this is the only entry-point

67
00:09:56,688 --> 00:09:58,477
l've arrived just now.
ln your presence

68
00:09:58,671 --> 00:10:00,908
ln my presence, you've
already passed through sir

69
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:04,039
You also had an officer of
your department with you

70
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:24,111
My brother has left with the gun.
You can do what you wish

71
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:29,234
He has only left with the gun.
Not the code

72
00:12:29,878 --> 00:12:32,114
Without the code,
that gun is worthless

73
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:35,380
And l'll get the gun back...
because you're with me

74
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:41,547
You can't do a thing!

75
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,878
Greetings, sir.
- Welcome, Bahadur Singh

76
00:12:49,206 --> 00:12:52,916
What brings you to my place today?
- l've come with a reason, sir

77
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,481
l've come to warn you, sir.
- Warn me...?

78
00:12:58,998 --> 00:13:02,511
A pair of thieves has struck terror.
- Terror...?

79
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:06,356
They hit upon such novel ideas
for robbery...

80
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:09,230
the police are left stunned.
- Don't tell me!

81
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:14,037
A few days ago, they got into
a cupboard and robbed the whole house

82
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:15,632
The whole house...?

83
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,867
They rent a house for a few days...

84
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,751
and sell the place,
as if they own it

85
00:13:21,142 --> 00:13:24,972
Sell it away?
- They pose as servants and...

86
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:28,748
Sir...
- Milk, or the yogurt-shake?

87
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:37,067
The two of them... at your place?

88
00:13:37,462 --> 00:13:41,870
The way they've taken care of me,
even my children haven't

89
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:46,190
After they've taken care of you,
they'll vanish with the loot!

90
00:13:46,678 --> 00:13:49,099
What do you mean?
- They're conning you!

91
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:52,427
They're the twosome
l've been warning you about

92
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:55,539
One is Tara...
- The other is Sitara. l know

93
00:13:57,782 --> 00:14:03,314
l say...
you've ruined all our efforts

94
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:05,611
Even if a criminal
wants to reform...

95
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:08,559
people like you
won't let him turn a new leaf

96
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:12,811
l say... have you forgotten?
- lt might hurt

97
00:14:13,174 --> 00:14:17,963
We had sworn it on your head
that we'd work hard for a living

98
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,976
That we'd never steal again

99
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:25,076
That's just what we were doing,
but you've told our employer about us

100
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:27,764
You've snatched our livelihood.
Where to...?

101
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:30,923
l got a kick on the waist

102
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:36,590
Sir, l wish to
tell you something today

103
00:14:37,718 --> 00:14:42,736
lf these guardians of the law
keep harping on cliches...

104
00:14:43,126 --> 00:14:46,508
people like us will keep
going to the jails

105
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:49,387
No, l'm not letting you guys
become thieves

106
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:53,867
You're staying here with me.
- Sir, l will leave now

107
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:56,235
But you'd better
remain alert with them

108
00:14:58,486 --> 00:15:00,395
A fire...
- he has started

109
00:15:00,662 --> 00:15:02,517
No, he hasn't

110
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:08,267
l know you guys are reformed

111
00:15:08,694 --> 00:15:12,523
But tell me of your modus operandi
as thieves...

112
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,947
so l will remain alert
with cheats in the future

113
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:21,716
We first survey a locality.
- Then?

114
00:15:22,262 --> 00:15:27,084
Then we get into the household
which is most innocent and wealthy

115
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:29,004
Then?
- Then...

116
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:33,227
we serve the master as his servants.
- Like you've been serving me?

117
00:15:35,222 --> 00:15:37,775
And when we've won the confidence
of our master...

118
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:41,877
we lace his milk or yogurt-shake
with a bit of sedative and...

119
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:49,365
Such foolish people! Their
yogurt-shake is laced with sedatives

120
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,434
And they don't even get to know...

121
00:15:53,398 --> 00:15:57,227
Did he... get to know?
The moron

122
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:13,551
Ruined

123
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:17,391
This man was out to
reform those thieves

124
00:16:18,998 --> 00:16:21,616
But those thieves have
put him to sleep

125
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:25,454
l told you to remain alert

126
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:27,956
But you will continue to sleep

127
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:34,986
C'mon

128
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:45,805
Tara and Sitara...
your game is up

129
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:50,990
Don't even try to escape.
Else, l'll let you have it

130
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:54,830
He's getting dramatic.
- Looks like he wants to die

131
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:57,707
Tell me something, Bahadur Singh

132
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:02,095
Why're you always hounding
us innocent guys?

133
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:08,589
Because of you guys,
l haven't had a wash in a week

134
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:12,434
But l'm taking you to
the cleaners. Nicely so!

135
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:22,671
No more jokes, lnspector.
Else, an innocent man will die

136
00:17:24,598 --> 00:17:27,467
That's Cobra, isn't it?
- Yes, sir

137
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:32,275
You guys know who you're messing with?

138
00:17:32,662 --> 00:17:35,728
Shut up! Else, l'll pluck
your eye-balls out

139
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:38,516
You speak as if you've got a
reward of millions on your head!

140
00:17:38,998 --> 00:17:40,907
You're right.
- Can't you see...?

141
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:43,147
the cops and the thieves
are making a deal?

142
00:17:46,678 --> 00:17:49,547
Go ahead and kill him. That's Cobra.
The dreaded criminal

143
00:17:49,974 --> 00:17:52,756
There's a reward of 100,000
for catching him, dead or alive

144
00:17:53,398 --> 00:17:56,910
Landed us in trouble, haven't you?
- You ought to carry a signboard...

145
00:17:57,302 --> 00:18:00,368
that you're Cobra.
How would we know?

146
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,907
There's a reward of
100,000 on his head

147
00:18:05,302 --> 00:18:07,604
Will we get it?
- Sure

148
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:10,932
lf l let you live
to claim the reward

149
00:18:11,638 --> 00:18:13,296
Arrest all three of them

150
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:15,946
Before l turn cold,
let me take his blessings

151
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:33,068
lt's Mr Cobra who's being
presented in court

152
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:37,553
And why're we going there?
- That's the new style

153
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:41,551
Hammer a nail into a block of wood,
it'll sail with it in the waters

154
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:46,735
Like Mr Cobra here.
He's the engine...

155
00:18:47,638 --> 00:18:52,723
and we're the trailers.
lf he runs, we run. For no reason

156
00:19:24,214 --> 00:19:28,175
For how many years do you think
Mr Cobra will be sent away?

157
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:37,068
Going by the way he looks
and behaves, l think...

158
00:19:39,701 --> 00:19:41,873
you tell me how many years
you're likely to get

159
00:19:50,902 --> 00:19:53,652
He's scowling at me.
- ls he?

160
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,187
Let me see, Brother Cobra

161
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,396
Sure he's scowling

162
00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:14,899
l think there's a terrible storm
lurking behind his silence

163
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:34,194
Brother...

164
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:37,939
don't be angry, we're kids.
Give us a smile

165
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,991
You guys are free

166
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,778
Move it

167
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:23,115
Lovely weather...
- Shut up. l've had enough

168
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:24,394
C'mon

169
00:21:40,918 --> 00:21:44,016
There's a car parked down there.
lt'll take you to the highway

170
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:45,387
Mike will...

171
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:51,477
We don't utter names
in the presence of strangers

172
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:54,347
He was revealing our gameplan

173
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:58,514
What's with him, brother?
Why's he fallen down?

174
00:21:59,158 --> 00:22:02,987
My bullet got him.
- We didn't even hear it

175
00:22:03,382 --> 00:22:05,553
When did it happen?
- You fired yesterday, did you?

176
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:08,145
Today. Want to hear it again?

177
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,820
Don't move... l'll shoot

178
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:14,769
Drop the guns,
or l'll shoot

179
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:20,587
Well? We call you brother
and you turn out to be a snob?

180
00:22:21,622 --> 00:22:24,110
What have you been up to?
What...?

181
00:22:24,694 --> 00:22:26,996
Are you going to talk
or undo these chains?

182
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:29,140
What's with the chains?

183
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:35,220
l say, who's screaming?

184
00:22:35,638 --> 00:22:38,256
ls it the chains?
- No, it's a leg actually

185
00:22:41,046 --> 00:22:43,763
The bullet hit him a little
below the chains in the leg

186
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:47,790
What the hell have you done?
Cobra... forgive us!

187
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:51,378
Was it a mistake?
- What if it struck him 4 inches up?

188
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:54,580
No one has survived.
- Let me undo these chains

189
00:22:57,718 --> 00:23:01,547
Why're you shooting at me?
- Not you, l blew the chains away

190
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,794
So what do we do?
- Run

191
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:11,151
Where's my brother... where?

192
00:23:13,173 --> 00:23:14,996
Get up, sir. Police!

193
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,707
Congratulations, sir.
Cobra has been captured

194
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:24,591
That's all right. But where have
Tara and Sitara disappeared...?

195
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:27,285
My job's on the line!
And you...

196
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,989
you call yourself a big criminal
and you couldn't stop those guys?

197
00:23:31,638 --> 00:23:32,750
Get up

198
00:23:33,526 --> 00:23:35,763
How will he get up? He's got
a bullet-injury in his leg

199
00:23:36,118 --> 00:23:38,354
Carry him on your shoulders
and take him to the hospital

200
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:44,430
Where will l go looking for them
in this wilderness? Tara! Sitara!

201
00:23:51,327 --> 00:23:53,748
Lots of stuff they've collected

202
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:01,904
Where are Tara and Sitara?
- Don't you read the newspapers?

203
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:05,266
Don't you watch TV...?
Has there been a robbery in town?

204
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:08,880
Has anyone robbed anyone...?
There's peace and calm in the city

205
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:11,371
What does that mean...? What?

206
00:24:11,763 --> 00:24:16,913
lt means my sons are at their
in-laws (read jail). Tihar Jail

207
00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:22,193
Your sons have run away from jail
and left me in a spot of bother

208
00:24:22,612 --> 00:24:25,197
What...? My sons have run away?

209
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:29,613
Scoundrels! When you can't take
care of my sons...

210
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:32,556
why do you take them away
for six months?

211
00:24:32,883 --> 00:24:35,501
They weren't guests! We took
them away because they were thieves!

212
00:24:35,827 --> 00:24:42,156
And there l was... with a heavy heart
l gave my darling sons to you!

213
00:24:43,443 --> 00:24:45,352
And you make them run away!

214
00:24:48,307 --> 00:24:51,122
Am l crazy to make
the prisoners run away?

215
00:24:51,443 --> 00:24:53,036
They ran away on their own

216
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:55,538
There must surely have been something
lacking in your hospitality

217
00:24:55,923 --> 00:24:58,606
Else, why would my sons run away?
They're my support in life

218
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:02,248
Tara and Sitara.
Now listen carefully, you ass

219
00:25:02,643 --> 00:25:06,734
lf my sons are not returned to me,
l'm going to curse you

220
00:25:07,187 --> 00:25:09,096
You're going to fall
to a criminal's bullets

221
00:25:09,363 --> 00:25:12,232
Even if you escape that,
you'll lose your job

222
00:25:12,915 --> 00:25:16,658
That's enough!
When l find your precious sons...

223
00:25:17,043 --> 00:25:19,912
l'll leave them here on my own.
This woman is a tyrant!

224
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:24,333
Tara, Sitara...
he has left

225
00:25:25,683 --> 00:25:30,091
Darling mother...
you were amazing

226
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:34,321
Enough. You boys ought to
read the writing on the wall...

227
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:38,155
and slip cross the border.
Do telephone me

228
00:25:38,611 --> 00:25:40,847
And don't come back,
till l tell you to

229
00:25:41,203 --> 00:25:45,840
Here's some money.
l collected it for bad times

230
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:50,095
You're so sweet...

231
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:53,521
you're so innocent...

232
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:56,392
you're lovable...

233
00:25:57,363 --> 00:26:01,192
dear mother... our mother

234
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:09,648
Mother, you've done so much for us.
Know what...?

235
00:26:10,163 --> 00:26:12,978
Even if our real mother was here...
- What did you say?

236
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:15,601
Have l given you any less love
than a real mother?

237
00:26:15,923 --> 00:26:18,476
Had your real mother been here, she'd
have handed you over to the police...

238
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:22,866
to prove her greatness. She wouldn't
have shielded you, like l did

239
00:26:23,283 --> 00:26:26,414
But you boys always say such things
to hurt my feelings

240
00:26:26,771 --> 00:26:31,725
No, mother... don't misunderstand us.
What we meant to say was that...

241
00:26:32,243 --> 00:26:35,756
had it not been for you,
we wouldn't even have been alive

242
00:26:36,787 --> 00:26:40,562
We know, the one who rears is far
greater than the one who gives birth

243
00:26:40,948 --> 00:26:44,395
And you have brought us up.
So please don't misunderstand us!

244
00:26:44,948 --> 00:26:49,203
All right. Run away
as quickly as you can

245
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:51,693
You only had the cops
after you earlier

246
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:54,952
But even Cobra's hunting for you now.
He wants to have your legs broken

247
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:58,219
Big deal! We're the ones
who shot at his leg!

248
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:03,336
Of course. But before he
gets into another game...

249
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:06,481
we'll start a new one.
- By cutting ourselves down to size

250
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:27,601
l say, hold this...
l'll make enquiries about the train

251
00:27:35,283 --> 00:27:36,810
Relax

252
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:47,441
What's happening?
Posters for a circus...?

253
00:27:47,956 --> 00:27:50,444
A magician in town?
Or is it a new movie?

254
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:53,517
Right now, it's these two thieves
who are making waves

255
00:27:54,899 --> 00:27:58,314
They've made lives miserable for the
cops and the citizens in the city

256
00:27:59,891 --> 00:28:01,801
Want to take a look?
- All right, let me see

257
00:28:02,035 --> 00:28:05,035
There's a reward for their capture.
lf you catch them, you keep some...

258
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:07,151
and give me some

259
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:47,272
Sitara, l can hear
the band being played for me!

260
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:54,952
l say...
- Look here

261
00:28:56,723 --> 00:28:59,440
l say, sir...
is that your daughter?

262
00:28:59,763 --> 00:29:03,407
No, not my daughter.
But you sure are my son-in-law

263
00:29:03,603 --> 00:29:05,261
Your blessings.
- Bless you

264
00:29:05,652 --> 00:29:08,205
l have another son-in-law...
where is he?

265
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:11,280
l'm not telling you.
- Don't tell me. But l know

266
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:15,762
You can't live without each other.
lf one of you is caught...

267
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:18,568
the other comes forward
to court arrest. Right?

268
00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:20,490
Let's go

269
00:29:35,603 --> 00:29:39,116
Wait there, Sitara...
else, l'll shoot

270
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:43,913
l say, praise the Lord!
- Tara...

271
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,792
You took such a huge risk
to save me?

272
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:51,022
No big risk, Sitara...
we share a great relationship

273
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:55,760
The world knows. Tara and Sitara
are two bodies and one soul

274
00:29:56,788 --> 00:29:59,602
lf something happened to you...?
- What's happening to me?

275
00:30:00,563 --> 00:30:03,433
Tell me, what would you have done
if you were in my shoes?

276
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:07,912
What's a jeep?
l'd have hijacked a train for you!

277
00:30:08,243 --> 00:30:09,967
There you are, aren't you?
- On the dot

278
00:30:10,163 --> 00:30:13,676
Sitara, let me tell you
something today

279
00:30:16,563 --> 00:30:19,246
l respect you a lot, my friend.
- Watch the jeep

280
00:30:26,067 --> 00:30:28,849
When we got to be friends...

281
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:31,920
we spawned a thousand stories
of friendship

282
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:35,763
Friendship was a precious gift

283
00:30:36,148 --> 00:30:39,017
Every season was lovely

284
00:30:39,475 --> 00:30:41,897
They know...
- They know...

285
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:45,743
the whole world knows that...

286
00:30:48,051 --> 00:30:49,360
my friend...

287
00:30:49,555 --> 00:30:51,115
One and one...

288
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:52,841
adds up to eleven...

289
00:30:53,203 --> 00:30:54,959
my friend

290
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:59,756
one and one...

291
00:31:00,723 --> 00:31:03,145
one and one...

292
00:31:03,603 --> 00:31:05,512
is eleven

293
00:31:19,092 --> 00:31:21,841
lf you see someone trying
to cross the fence...

294
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:24,079
go ahead and shoot them

295
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:28,298
Who's in that jeep,
could you explain?

296
00:31:33,363 --> 00:31:35,021
Major Ram Singh

297
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:37,449
l'm Raju Nepali

298
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:41,360
Only two men can help you
cross the border

299
00:31:42,003 --> 00:31:43,912
One is Major Ram Singh,
who won't do it

300
00:31:44,243 --> 00:31:48,073
The other is me...
l do it only for money

301
00:31:48,852 --> 00:31:51,273
That's a new one.
- How much money will you take?

302
00:31:51,603 --> 00:31:54,156
200,000 for two guys.
- We aren't asking the price...

303
00:31:54,483 --> 00:31:57,680
of this place. We want to know
the price for crossing over

304
00:31:58,323 --> 00:32:00,560
That's the price for
crossing over

305
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:05,032
Come over, when you have the money.
You'll find Raju Nepali right here

306
00:32:06,963 --> 00:32:10,346
He won't even say bye...
rude man

307
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:13,682
How are we going to raise
200,000 in this area?

308
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:15,856
Not a soul to rob

309
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:22,634
They found no dear ones, but they picked
on Apna Bank to fulfill their needs

310
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,569
You think we can manage to
squeeze 200,000 out of them?

311
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:30,961
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings

312
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,422
You want to open an account?
- No, we're planning a robbery

313
00:32:33,843 --> 00:32:35,752
Robbery...?
- Foolish man!

314
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:39,917
What will two top businessmen do
if not open an account!

315
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:42,734
We have a lot of money.
- l see

316
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:46,121
Ten million

317
00:32:47,283 --> 00:32:49,006
Ten...

318
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:53,356
He's stuck on ten,
as if he hasn't seen it at all

319
00:32:54,227 --> 00:32:57,839
We hardly have 2 million
in our bank at any given time

320
00:32:58,515 --> 00:33:01,679
lt's a very small bank.
- Not small...

321
00:33:02,164 --> 00:33:03,211
Listen

322
00:33:05,523 --> 00:33:07,432
That's 10 million lost!

323
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:10,889
Something amazing happened
at the bank today

324
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:14,599
There were these customers who
wanted to open an account

325
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:18,701
Of... 10 million

326
00:33:20,116 --> 00:33:23,760
Like an idiot, l told them that
we never have more than 2 million

327
00:33:24,148 --> 00:33:26,057
And they walked away

328
00:33:26,803 --> 00:33:29,324
ls manager in?
-Who could it be so late in the night?

329
00:33:29,523 --> 00:33:31,432
Give in the name of God!

330
00:33:32,627 --> 00:33:34,962
ls this any time to beg
for alms...? Go away

331
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:38,152
We are not beggars, we're here
to make a beggar out of you

332
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:40,845
Who are you?

333
00:33:42,963 --> 00:33:44,686
Look here. l have one too

334
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:47,183
Recognise us? He's the elder brother,
l'm the younger one

335
00:33:47,763 --> 00:33:50,000
Brothers with six bullets each.
- Six...?

336
00:33:54,676 --> 00:33:55,690
Recognise us?

337
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:06,320
Junior... that's a beautiful girl.
- Where?

338
00:34:09,907 --> 00:34:12,722
What insolence is this...?
Dad, call the police immediately

339
00:34:13,108 --> 00:34:18,225
Your telephone's already dead.
- Your dad could be dead too

340
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:24,616
Don't be sad. The look of you
has already driven me mad

341
00:34:25,203 --> 00:34:29,032
See? Your daughter has
robbed my elder brother

342
00:34:29,459 --> 00:34:34,577
l'm going to do some robbing now.
ln your bank

343
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:36,808
We'll go to sleep right here

344
00:34:37,204 --> 00:34:40,171
You'll take us to the bank
tomorrow morning...

345
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:44,969
and personally have your bank robbed.
You'll then see us out...

346
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:47,665
and then will follow the police,
the questions, the answers...

347
00:34:47,924 --> 00:34:50,793
the news channels...
you'll become famous

348
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,845
Keep eating

349
00:34:56,468 --> 00:35:00,723
Brother! There's porridge!
Potato and cauliflower pancakes!

350
00:35:01,812 --> 00:35:04,048
Let me have some porridge
in peace

351
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:08,973
l've made it...
would you like some?

352
00:35:09,363 --> 00:35:11,272
Let me eat it in peace

353
00:35:11,603 --> 00:35:16,076
Will you have some...?
- l'm already eating some. You have it

354
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,767
l see. That's non-fattening,
this is fattening

355
00:35:18,963 --> 00:35:20,240
Very intelligent

356
00:35:20,564 --> 00:35:23,564
What are you doing here?
Go and fetch a bag...

357
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:26,640
we've got to rob a bank!
You got to understand

358
00:35:41,043 --> 00:35:43,280
ls he laughing or crying?
l can't tell

359
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:46,349
Hurry up, son.
You know who l am

360
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:50,385
The brothers with six bullets each.
- Hurry up, l hate delays

361
00:35:50,643 --> 00:35:51,920
Hurry

362
00:35:53,044 --> 00:35:58,313
Are you laughing or crying?
l can't make out

363
00:36:02,356 --> 00:36:04,079
Just run away with me

364
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:06,640
l have so much of money,
l'll keep you happy

365
00:36:09,524 --> 00:36:12,393
You've robbed all the money and you
want to run away with my daughter?

366
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:15,218
The cops will get us, brother.
- Why?

367
00:36:15,603 --> 00:36:18,286
We're bandits, that's why.
Let's go

368
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:21,674
Let's go, l say!
- Let's go

369
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:24,881
They've taken away all the money!

370
00:36:34,803 --> 00:36:37,967
Brother... what bad times

371
00:36:38,324 --> 00:36:40,233
We used to run away with
the money earlier

372
00:36:40,563 --> 00:36:43,116
Now we give money and run away.
- Don't you think...

373
00:36:43,443 --> 00:36:45,352
that rather than pay this guy
200,000...

374
00:36:45,748 --> 00:36:49,359
we could've struck a deal
with Ram Singh himself?

375
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:51,112
He'd have shot you

376
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:57,834
He's been shot!
l see Ram Singh clearly!

377
00:37:02,547 --> 00:37:04,271
Ram Singh's house

378
00:37:04,563 --> 00:37:09,036
Tara and Sitara would never find
a better place to evade the police

379
00:37:09,363 --> 00:37:13,389
Well, they could effortlessly
gain entry into any house

380
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:18,450
Let's see how they trick
their way into Ram Singh's house

381
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:20,872
A hundred-rupee note!

382
00:37:21,843 --> 00:37:23,752
God, if You had to cure
the itch in my hand...

383
00:37:23,923 --> 00:37:25,833
You could've given me
a 500-rupee note!

384
00:37:29,843 --> 00:37:31,185
500 rupees...?

385
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:34,954
Which side of the bed did
l get off this morning?

386
00:37:35,283 --> 00:37:39,440
God, let me find a wallet stuffed
with money since You're so kind!

387
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:46,606
A wallet stuffed with notes!

388
00:37:58,131 --> 00:38:00,236
Scoundrel!
- Cur!

389
00:38:00,884 --> 00:38:05,673
We're going to cure your itch today!
- You steal our wallet!

390
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:08,498
l didn't steal it...
it was lying here

391
00:38:08,691 --> 00:38:10,796
Not lying there.
lt was kept there safely

392
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:14,253
Take him to the police station.
- Let's go

393
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:18,472
No, sir! Please don't
take me to the police station

394
00:38:18,803 --> 00:38:20,145
l'm a very poor man!

395
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,322
l've got a mother, two brothers
and three sisters

396
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:24,010
All sisters have got
to be married

397
00:38:24,243 --> 00:38:28,782
You can marry two of them,
l'll find a better guy for the third

398
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:31,594
Will you find anyone
better than us, you ass?

399
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:33,646
Look at this personality

400
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:36,394
Check out my looks...
better than us, you say?

401
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:39,917
Listen...
You tell him

402
00:38:41,523 --> 00:38:45,931
We aren't marrying your sisters,
but we can help in their marriage

403
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:48,232
How?
- Here you are

404
00:38:49,203 --> 00:38:52,400
Help with a hundred bucks?
- All right, you have a big quota

405
00:38:54,003 --> 00:38:58,094
For the money, you'll have to
extend some help to us

406
00:38:58,484 --> 00:39:00,720
What help?
- Ask my senior

407
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:04,721
Ask junior.
- Ask senior

408
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,567
Just tell me... stop teasing me

409
00:39:07,891 --> 00:39:10,509
Are you scolding us?
- No, please tell me

410
00:39:10,675 --> 00:39:15,115
Madam, look!
Your wedding necklace

411
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:18,637
How did you get it?
- A thief was running away with it

412
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:23,761
This is the last memento of
my husband. lt's so dear to me

413
00:39:24,723 --> 00:39:26,446
l'm glad you caught
the thief, Chhotu

414
00:39:26,643 --> 00:39:29,840
Not me, it was these decent gentlemen.
Tara and Sitara

415
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:32,392
They're the ones
who caught the thief

416
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:43,409
l say, Sitara... a familiar sight.
Our house hasn't changed at all!

417
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:45,835
The same house, the same windows
and the same doors

418
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,015
The same curtains too

419
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,405
Have you been
in this house earlier?

420
00:39:51,827 --> 00:39:55,439
Been here? This is where
we were born, what say?

421
00:39:56,723 --> 00:40:00,236
This is the place where we
were christened and initiated

422
00:40:01,203 --> 00:40:03,691
l'm Tara.
- l'm Sitara

423
00:40:05,107 --> 00:40:07,922
Our father's was going through
a lean patch in those days

424
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:12,713
He had to sell this bungalow.
- Ever since, to this day...

425
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:17,066
we brothers miss our parents
so much!

426
00:40:19,507 --> 00:40:23,282
Mother!
- No, son... calm down

427
00:40:26,227 --> 00:40:28,082
That's just what mother used to say

428
00:40:32,275 --> 00:40:34,795
Don't...
- Mother!

429
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,919
l really miss my mother!
- You are great

430
00:40:44,948 --> 00:40:46,857
A kid...
- Kid?

431
00:40:47,283 --> 00:40:49,192
He's a big kid

432
00:40:51,764 --> 00:40:55,277
Remember when we were children?
l used to bring a chocolate like him

433
00:40:55,923 --> 00:40:58,541
And l used to snatch it from you.
- l used to snatch it back

434
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,320
Know what?
l love eating things l snatch

435
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:04,562
Really? You'll make it big some day!

436
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,140
Sister-in-law... mother...

437
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,360
Gotcha!

438
00:41:12,243 --> 00:41:14,480
Gotcha!
- Gotcha what?

439
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:20,690
He has found his room.
- Not my room... my bedroom

440
00:41:21,843 --> 00:41:23,566
l've found my bedroom

441
00:41:24,979 --> 00:41:27,597
The same texture,
the same air...

442
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:32,079
Come to your senses.
- l've just come to my senses!

443
00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:36,809
l've gone crazy looking
at this house today!

444
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,072
Tara, if you're so attached
to this house...

445
00:41:40,468 --> 00:41:44,624
let's hire a room in a hotel
and you can keep looking at it

446
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:47,049
Must we live in a hotel?
- Yes

447
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:51,025
Stay here for a few days, son.
This is like your own house

448
00:41:51,763 --> 00:41:53,040
Mother!

449
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,849
Tara, don't...

450
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:59,920
l can't get up, you see.
l was only taking her blessing

451
00:42:22,483 --> 00:42:24,239
Brother Sitara...
- Go on

452
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:26,537
Does it remind you of something?
- What?

453
00:42:27,123 --> 00:42:31,596
Didn't our daddy look like him
in his younger days?

454
00:42:31,987 --> 00:42:33,842
Oh yes, the same height,
the same moustache...

455
00:42:34,195 --> 00:42:38,635
and a stern disposition.
There's no difference at all

456
00:42:39,892 --> 00:42:41,321
Who are they?

457
00:42:41,843 --> 00:42:44,080
This bungalow used to belong to them

458
00:42:44,467 --> 00:42:47,664
They're here for a few days,
we asked them to stay over

459
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:53,037
l don't allow strangers
to stay in my house

460
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:03,118
This house isn't ours anymore

461
00:43:03,763 --> 00:43:06,797
So how can the folks here
feel any sense of belonging?

462
00:43:07,443 --> 00:43:10,061
You are not going anywhere.
You're staying here

463
00:43:11,283 --> 00:43:14,731
You don't know what a big favour
you have done to me

464
00:43:15,508 --> 00:43:19,337
l know my son very well.
He'll never disobey me

465
00:43:20,116 --> 00:43:23,149
He's a soldier, you see.
He can't trust people easily

466
00:43:23,763 --> 00:43:25,672
Chhotu...
- Yes, madam?

467
00:43:26,068 --> 00:43:29,897
Take their luggage to the out-house.
- Sure. Please give it to me

468
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:37,962
Mother, even God wouldn't
look any different from you

469
00:43:42,003 --> 00:43:45,200
We haven't ever seen You...

470
00:43:55,828 --> 00:44:01,708
Every saint and Prophet
has said...

471
00:44:02,387 --> 00:44:04,843
in this world...

472
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:07,534
love is the greatest feeling

473
00:44:08,308 --> 00:44:11,177
End my agony...

474
00:44:12,115 --> 00:44:14,984
O Lord...

475
00:44:16,051 --> 00:44:18,472
heed the cry of Radha...

476
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:22,702
Lord Krishna

477
00:44:24,243 --> 00:44:27,112
Help it sail across...

478
00:44:28,531 --> 00:44:31,400
the boat of my dreams...

479
00:44:32,499 --> 00:44:35,761
heed the cry of Radha...

480
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:39,080
Lord Krishna

481
00:44:44,403 --> 00:44:48,746
You sing very well, son.
lt gives me so much of peace

482
00:44:49,684 --> 00:44:52,072
Sitara and l have
always been like this

483
00:44:52,595 --> 00:44:55,345
We've always wanted to
sing melodious songs

484
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:58,538
But alas! we've always
had a terrible chorus

485
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,414
Where's Sitara?
- l say the prayers in the morning...

486
00:45:02,772 --> 00:45:04,681
he performs the rituals
in the evening

487
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:07,435
That's very nice.
Let me take you out

488
00:45:07,699 --> 00:45:09,161
Take her blessings

489
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:13,705
l can drive the wheelchair
on my own

490
00:45:14,356 --> 00:45:18,000
Chhotu, why've you come in
with my luggage and footwear?

491
00:45:18,388 --> 00:45:20,689
l sent for him.
- You...?

492
00:45:21,843 --> 00:45:24,396
We were comfortable in the out-house.
Why call us into the house?

493
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:27,276
Neither are you staying in the house,
nor in the out-house

494
00:45:27,603 --> 00:45:30,734
You can win over my family with
your sentimental crap... not me

495
00:45:31,251 --> 00:45:33,356
You haven't driven Sitara out,
have you?

496
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:37,520
He's waiting for you at the gate.
- You've already driven him out?

497
00:45:38,675 --> 00:45:40,082
Come on, Chhotu

498
00:45:41,043 --> 00:45:44,240
Don't you think we have
been humiliated?

499
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:48,521
Brother...
- You're here too?

500
00:45:48,723 --> 00:45:53,196
l was singing a hymn and he
very respectfully saw me out

501
00:45:53,779 --> 00:45:56,746
But l'm told he didn't even
let you change?

502
00:45:57,363 --> 00:46:01,192
What's changing? He didn't even
let me go to the loo

503
00:46:02,163 --> 00:46:05,512
Listen, get a can for my brother.
- Shut up!

504
00:46:06,963 --> 00:46:10,792
You know, when l lose my temper,
l always give someone a thrashing

505
00:46:11,188 --> 00:46:13,293
l've lost my temper too!

506
00:46:14,643 --> 00:46:17,840
But we can't beat up Ram Singh.
- So?

507
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:24,240
l'm a very poor man! l have a mother,
two brothers and three sisters!

508
00:46:25,203 --> 00:46:26,665
After him

509
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:47,660
The bullet mustn't hit Ram Singh's
son. We want him alive

510
00:47:10,323 --> 00:47:12,046
Help!

511
00:47:14,163 --> 00:47:17,360
Tara, please help!
- Not to worry

512
00:47:18,132 --> 00:47:21,198
The kid has won the race,
you guys have lost

513
00:47:21,587 --> 00:47:24,882
Get going.
- Going...? Me?

514
00:47:25,683 --> 00:47:26,893
Brother...

515
00:47:27,923 --> 00:47:31,436
the jungle's already green.
Come over

516
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:35,689
What happened?
- We have thugs here!

517
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:39,245
You handle them.
- l'm on a pedal...

518
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:43,281
how can l handle them? Get it!
- l'm busy with my own handle!

519
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:47,344
Your handle's busy, my pedal's busy...
it's no so easy

520
00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:50,381
These guys are pointing guns...
swap your handle!

521
00:47:50,836 --> 00:47:51,850
Get him

522
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:54,954
Not so late... they'll lay me out

523
00:48:02,003 --> 00:48:04,075
What are you here for? Run away!
- Run

524
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:05,291
Scram!

525
00:48:14,164 --> 00:48:16,946
Dad, come to
the club house immediately

526
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:20,722
They tried to kidnap me...
the driver has been killed

527
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:23,693
ln the streams of time,
we do not flow

528
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:27,432
We don't talk too much...

529
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:30,766
but we don't remain
silent either

530
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:34,089
Atrocities, we do not tolerate

531
00:48:34,484 --> 00:48:37,353
This world...

532
00:48:37,683 --> 00:48:41,512
has conceded defeat to us...

533
00:48:43,443 --> 00:48:44,785
buddy-boy...

534
00:48:44,948 --> 00:48:47,282
one and one make eleven

535
00:48:51,123 --> 00:48:54,320
Ram Singh's here.
- Sit in your vehicle

536
00:48:56,947 --> 00:49:00,722
Brother, do l look decent enough?
- Wear a sad look

537
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,977
Are you all right?
- Yes

538
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:11,272
Had they not arrived on time,
they'd have kidnapped me today

539
00:49:11,891 --> 00:49:12,840
Bansi...

540
00:49:17,043 --> 00:49:18,952
How will l ever thank you?

541
00:49:19,348 --> 00:49:24,137
You're not supposed to
thank children. Only bless them

542
00:49:26,643 --> 00:49:29,196
We must leave now.
Good bye

543
00:49:30,964 --> 00:49:33,680
You're not going anywhere.
You can stay at the outhouse...

544
00:49:34,323 --> 00:49:36,560
for as long as you wish.
- Brother!

545
00:49:38,163 --> 00:49:39,886
Brother!

546
00:49:46,996 --> 00:49:53,837
l have travelled a long distance,
with my love

547
00:49:58,675 --> 00:50:02,155
Tell me something, sir.
Do you plan on buying this bungalow?

548
00:50:02,483 --> 00:50:05,036
You've made yourself comfortable.
- That's like us brothers, you see

549
00:50:05,428 --> 00:50:08,494
Even when we buy a pair of slippers,
we properly check it out

550
00:50:08,883 --> 00:50:11,752
Can't say when we might use it.
- One thing, sir

551
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:14,928
Whenever you buy the bungalow,
let me be your servant

552
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:18,093
l'm very poor. l have a mother,
two brothers and three sisters

553
00:50:18,483 --> 00:50:20,392
You've got to get them married?
- Right, sir

554
00:50:20,563 --> 00:50:23,280
He's eyeing the bungalow.
- Listen, arrange for some breakfast

555
00:50:25,203 --> 00:50:27,691
You won't forget, will you?
- No way!

556
00:50:28,435 --> 00:50:31,915
l know you've got 3 mothers,
300 brothers, 3500 sisters!

557
00:50:32,243 --> 00:50:34,415
No, one mother, two brothers...
- Get lost!

558
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:41,196
Brother Tara...
- Brother Sitara?

559
00:50:41,587 --> 00:50:43,759
We have a place to hide.
- Right

560
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:49,195
Till Cobra dies,
let's hide in this hole

561
00:50:50,483 --> 00:50:53,036
You see something?
- Great danger

562
00:50:55,156 --> 00:50:58,800
Ram Singh has not adopted us to
take care of us till we're old

563
00:50:59,188 --> 00:51:03,017
We're his guests for a few days!
- We aren't his guests, brother!

564
00:51:05,523 --> 00:51:10,312
You've seen only Ram Singh,
not his sister

565
00:51:12,724 --> 00:51:15,691
She's so beautiful,
and they're such a nice family

566
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:21,517
l wonder why l mustn't marry her
and live with them

567
00:51:21,907 --> 00:51:24,144
Live with them?
What do you think?

568
00:51:24,723 --> 00:51:28,552
ls he the potter Chandan Seth to
give his daughter's hand in yours?

569
00:51:28,915 --> 00:51:31,119
lt's Ram Singh!
- Big deal!

570
00:51:31,507 --> 00:51:34,704
Just as we've got into his house,
we'll get into his heart too

571
00:51:35,443 --> 00:51:36,818
Really?

572
00:51:42,003 --> 00:51:45,200
Know what Pinki?
l'm very happy with your brother

573
00:51:45,843 --> 00:51:49,105
lt was great of him to let
Tara and Sitara stay in your house

574
00:51:49,939 --> 00:51:54,162
For what Tara and Sitara have done,
the house is nothing

575
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,815
They deserve a place
in our hearts

576
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:02,545
Sitara's such a he-man.
He's so brave

577
00:52:04,243 --> 00:52:05,999
Bunty wasn't saved by Sitara alone

578
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,560
Even Tara risked his life
to save him

579
00:52:08,947 --> 00:52:13,104
He's so brave. l'm surprised how he
beat them up, even in a wheelchair

580
00:52:14,643 --> 00:52:18,353
With a brother like Sitara,
what's a wheelchair...

581
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:20,559
you can deliver the punch
even from a bed!

582
00:52:20,723 --> 00:52:24,236
Why're you giving Sitara
all the credit?

583
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:29,678
l'm talking about both of them.
- But l could hear only about one

584
00:52:30,099 --> 00:52:31,790
Because you've been talking
about the other

585
00:52:31,923 --> 00:52:33,068
Oh yes!

586
00:52:34,003 --> 00:52:37,037
l forgot, l must leave now.
l'm getting late for the college

587
00:52:37,683 --> 00:52:40,552
l've got to meet the doctor
and ask him about Tara's legs

588
00:52:40,948 --> 00:52:45,355
But you stay here. You never know.
Sitara might spring here

589
00:53:00,211 --> 00:53:02,120
My love...

590
00:53:04,659 --> 00:53:06,481
my beloved...

591
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:10,323
my love...

592
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:21,456
l'm your beloved...

593
00:53:23,411 --> 00:53:26,640
l'm a lover...

594
00:53:27,091 --> 00:53:29,512
l've given you my heart

595
00:53:33,427 --> 00:53:36,624
l'm a lover...

596
00:53:37,107 --> 00:53:39,824
l've given you my heart

597
00:53:50,643 --> 00:53:53,261
Give my beloved to me...

598
00:53:53,716 --> 00:54:00,753
l've pleaded with God,
l've wept on every shoulder

599
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,667
l have wept so much

600
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:07,274
My love, l have
given my heart to you

601
00:54:11,763 --> 00:54:17,840
Give me my beloved...

602
00:54:18,227 --> 00:54:24,872
l've pleaded with God,
l've wept on every shoulder

603
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:08,009
My beloved, l seek...

604
00:55:08,403 --> 00:55:11,086
at every beautiful twist
love takes

605
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:17,416
To my house she shall come some day,
leaving everything behind

606
00:55:18,579 --> 00:55:21,296
You're the one
who lingers in my breath

607
00:55:21,843 --> 00:55:25,040
You're the one
l always think about

608
00:55:35,891 --> 00:55:38,761
l'm crazy about her...

609
00:55:39,283 --> 00:55:43,538
l'd tell her, if l met her...

610
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,832
l'm your beloved

611
00:55:46,163 --> 00:55:49,033
Your beloved

612
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:52,552
You're my lover...

613
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:56,136
you're the one
l have given my heart to

614
00:56:03,123 --> 00:56:04,846
Sweetheart...

615
00:56:09,843 --> 00:56:11,566
O beloved...

616
00:56:15,603 --> 00:56:17,905
my love...

617
00:56:47,412 --> 00:56:49,005
Where has is gone?

618
00:57:03,603 --> 00:57:05,326
What are you doing?

619
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:10,706
Obviously, l can't swim
in a bathtub

620
00:57:11,283 --> 00:57:15,440
l've been trying to commit suicide.
- What?

621
00:57:15,827 --> 00:57:19,602
Yes, there must be a hilltop
in your city?

622
00:57:20,308 --> 00:57:23,374
There is. Why?
- So take me there...

623
00:57:23,763 --> 00:57:27,025
and give me a gentle kick,
l'll fall off

624
00:57:27,603 --> 00:57:30,952
What are you talking about?
- l have another idea

625
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:33,354
Hold my face like this...

626
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:39,117
and shove it in the tub.
Hold it down firmly, with your foot

627
00:57:39,508 --> 00:57:42,574
Till l stop breathing,
don't take your foot off

628
00:57:42,963 --> 00:57:46,160
l've made a lot of unsuccessful
attempts at suicide

629
00:57:48,148 --> 00:57:53,265
Look at this book. lt has 250 ways
of overcoming your disability

630
00:57:53,683 --> 00:57:56,400
You will be able to walk again,
run again...

631
00:57:56,723 --> 00:58:00,236
and maybe even dance with me too.
- Dance?

632
00:58:02,163 --> 00:58:04,072
Will l be able to walk again?
- Certainly

633
00:58:04,468 --> 00:58:08,559
You mean, l can run...?
l can take your hand and run?!

634
00:58:19,603 --> 00:58:23,018
Pinki's dress...?
Why's it here?

635
00:58:25,203 --> 00:58:27,505
The lame-duck hasn't
jumped her, or has he?

636
00:58:44,723 --> 00:58:48,618
Sitara... you're back early.
- Early?

637
00:58:49,971 --> 00:58:53,419
l think l'm too late.
- Not at all

638
00:58:56,883 --> 00:59:00,145
Give me an explanation.
- Explain what...?

639
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:04,562
She was here to cure a cripple!
- Cure...? There you go!

640
00:59:10,323 --> 00:59:13,192
You're the elder brother
and you push your kid brother?

641
00:59:13,588 --> 00:59:17,035
lt isn't two days since we got here,
and you've gone so far ahead!

642
00:59:17,363 --> 00:59:20,265
l planned on going deeper...
right to the altar

643
00:59:21,299 --> 00:59:22,793
Come to your senses!

644
00:59:23,123 --> 00:59:25,295
We're here to escape,
not to play grooms!

645
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:30,481
lf only Ram Singh saw what l did, he'd
have made a real cripple out of you!

646
00:59:30,803 --> 00:59:34,960
What will Ram Singh do?
l'm not entering his sister's life

647
00:59:35,283 --> 00:59:38,480
His sister's coming into my life!
- Really?

648
00:59:42,003 --> 00:59:45,451
l smile to myself when l think
how tickled l'll be...

649
00:59:45,843 --> 00:59:51,920
when his sister massages my legs.
l can laugh already

650
00:59:57,875 --> 00:59:59,785
Tara, did you feel any pain?

651
01:00:00,372 --> 01:00:02,859
l felt something,
but it wasn't pain

652
01:00:03,379 --> 01:00:05,419
No? You will now

653
01:00:07,923 --> 01:00:11,120
Did you feel any pain now?
- lt wasn't pain

654
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:14,376
And why're you smiling?
- l smile because l see...

655
01:00:14,803 --> 01:00:18,000
how concerned you are
about my cure

656
01:00:18,547 --> 01:00:23,282
You're putting your heart into it.
You're leaving nothing to chance

657
01:00:24,372 --> 01:00:26,543
l think this stick is a fake

658
01:00:26,739 --> 01:00:31,279
With a little stick
you're out to cure me, Pinki

659
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:34,222
And so many big ones
are broken already

660
01:00:35,859 --> 01:00:37,681
Look at that.
- What?

661
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:43,241
Sister, throw away that little stick.
l'll use this whip on Tara's legs...

662
01:00:43,636 --> 01:00:47,018
and make him feel the pain!
Out of my way!

663
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:52,078
Brother, why's the whole family
bent on curing me?

664
01:00:52,499 --> 01:00:57,071
Why's this guy charging at me?
Ask him to hold on

665
01:00:57,459 --> 01:01:01,999
l can't. When Ram Singh
can't control him, how can l?

666
01:01:03,923 --> 01:01:05,679
l've never taken
such a huge stick!

667
01:01:05,843 --> 01:01:08,396
This is a well-oiled stick!

668
01:01:08,819 --> 01:01:10,892
lt has squeezed the life
out of several men!

669
01:01:11,283 --> 01:01:14,152
One blow with this stick and...
- Handle him, brother

670
01:01:14,548 --> 01:01:16,074
He's mad

671
01:01:16,307 --> 01:01:17,714
He's a monkey!

672
01:01:23,892 --> 01:01:24,971
There goes

673
01:01:32,403 --> 01:01:34,312
My leg...

674
01:01:35,283 --> 01:01:38,152
Why're you hitting me?
l was only curing you!

675
01:01:38,483 --> 01:01:40,588
l was curing you too

676
01:01:41,811 --> 01:01:46,154
Give him a banana.
- Yes. For extra energy

677
01:01:46,547 --> 01:01:48,140
Here you are

678
01:01:48,787 --> 01:01:51,722
No one can cure him!
- Hush. You mustn't say such things

679
01:01:52,051 --> 01:01:55,433
l'll surely be cured...
with love

680
01:02:03,955 --> 01:02:05,581
l say, Pinki...

681
01:02:06,003 --> 01:02:08,621
Sitara? How are you?
- Wonderful

682
01:02:08,979 --> 01:02:13,256
l say, what are you doing
with such fat books?

683
01:02:13,587 --> 01:02:16,075
l'm trying to find a new cure
for Tara

684
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:20,080
A new cure for Tara?
- Because he can't walk

685
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,956
l'm trying to find a cure
that will help him move around

686
01:02:23,283 --> 01:02:26,927
Listen to me.
Tara's actually hungry for love

687
01:02:27,252 --> 01:02:30,186
No amount of beating
can ever cure him

688
01:02:32,627 --> 01:02:35,278
So what am l to do?
Could you suggest something?

689
01:02:39,347 --> 01:02:42,478
You ought to produce
the heat in him

690
01:02:43,155 --> 01:02:49,517
lgnite a fire in his body.
So that he burns in the fire...

691
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:55,091
runs helter skelter,
cries, howls, jumps around...

692
01:02:55,604 --> 01:02:59,117
you get me, don't you?
- Yes

693
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,313
Tea

694
01:03:03,603 --> 01:03:07,564
Tell me something, Chhotu.
How do you start a fire?

695
01:03:07,891 --> 01:03:09,352
With petrol

696
01:03:10,035 --> 01:03:16,265
Start the fire with petrol,
and he'll race around like a car

697
01:03:16,595 --> 01:03:18,221
All right

698
01:03:19,731 --> 01:03:22,317
That's the shock-therapy!

699
01:03:22,675 --> 01:03:29,516
There's mischief
in the air today...

700
01:03:30,803 --> 01:03:36,237
it's terribly mischievous today...

701
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:41,998
A storm is coming

702
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,798
That's my line... stop singing

703
01:03:47,763 --> 01:03:51,079
Pinki... why're you watering
the place around me?

704
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:54,826
lt isn't water. lt's petrol

705
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:57,773
l use my hands on the wheelchair,
why use petrol?

706
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:01,263
lt isn't to run your wheelchair,
it's to make you run

707
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:03,660
Me...?
- This is shock therapy

708
01:04:05,043 --> 01:04:07,760
They find a new therapy
for me every day

709
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:10,953
l wonder what she'll do...
she won't start a fire, l hope

710
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:18,190
The dark clouds
move in the skies...

711
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:21,357
every bud...

712
01:04:21,779 --> 01:04:24,234
casts a suspicious
glance at me

713
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:28,072
My God!

714
01:04:48,947 --> 01:04:51,118
Escaped!

715
01:04:57,843 --> 01:04:59,185
Escaped, finally!

716
01:05:00,723 --> 01:05:04,138
You ran away even before
the cure could work!

717
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:07,249
l couldn't help it...
you don't understand

718
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:10,800
Where do you get such
great ideas from?

719
01:05:11,123 --> 01:05:12,911
As if it was my idea.
- Whose was it?

720
01:05:13,203 --> 01:05:15,440
lt was your brother Sitara's

721
01:05:17,043 --> 01:05:20,109
So he's the brains
behind this sight?

722
01:05:20,595 --> 01:05:22,799
Where's the genius?

723
01:05:24,723 --> 01:05:26,250
Where's he?

724
01:05:26,643 --> 01:05:30,091
Sitara, l feel great love
for you today

725
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,809
So, embrace me.
- Let me complete my line

726
01:05:34,131 --> 01:05:40,329
This is Pinki's book.
lt has 250 cures for my impairment

727
01:05:40,755 --> 01:05:43,276
And you gave her
an extra tip!

728
01:05:43,763 --> 01:05:49,164
l merely told her to produce
the heat of love in your body

729
01:05:49,491 --> 01:05:51,084
The heat of love is something...

730
01:05:51,284 --> 01:05:53,193
and setting the body on fire
is yet something else

731
01:05:53,523 --> 01:05:55,432
She was setting my body on fire.
- On fire...?

732
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:01,806
Hide me somewhere...
she seems to have found another cure

733
01:06:02,131 --> 01:06:06,409
Hold on. Let me bowl her out.
- No... l'm bowling her out

734
01:06:06,771 --> 01:06:09,106
Can't l at least hold her?
- Go ahead

735
01:06:09,843 --> 01:06:11,752
Maintain the distance

736
01:07:06,483 --> 01:07:09,680
My enemy...

737
01:07:10,163 --> 01:07:13,611
this is a beautiful moment

738
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:21,135
My foe... a beauty stands
for your love

739
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:25,035
Take me in your embrace...

740
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:28,558
think of nothing else

741
01:08:05,107 --> 01:08:08,882
You're a woman,
a mischievous girl...

742
01:08:09,555 --> 01:08:11,465
l'm an innocent boy

743
01:08:11,827 --> 01:08:14,795
l'm a priest's son,
related to those who worship

744
01:08:15,347 --> 01:08:17,998
You're a big name...

745
01:08:18,483 --> 01:08:22,029
Me, an enemy...?
No way

746
01:08:57,843 --> 01:09:02,447
l will keep awake.
l'll keep you awake too...

747
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:05,106
all night

748
01:09:05,523 --> 01:09:08,206
Let my pining be sated...

749
01:09:08,532 --> 01:09:12,241
do something about it

750
01:09:13,203 --> 01:09:16,519
My heart beats
in loneliness...

751
01:09:16,851 --> 01:09:20,080
there's no one else
at home, my love

752
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:24,529
So come into my arms

753
01:10:00,467 --> 01:10:01,515
Listen, lady...

754
01:10:04,276 --> 01:10:05,486
listen, Goddess!

755
01:10:06,996 --> 01:10:08,905
Someone tell her...

756
01:10:09,651 --> 01:10:12,968
the lndian woman is most beautiful
and talented

757
01:10:13,395 --> 01:10:15,599
But l don't want to be captured

758
01:10:17,139 --> 01:10:20,816
My patience is breaking,
l'm slipping...

759
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:24,238
stop, stop, stop

760
01:11:25,395 --> 01:11:28,145
The curtains are drawn

761
01:11:28,563 --> 01:11:32,011
All windows are shut

762
01:11:32,884 --> 01:11:35,666
For a while...

763
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:39,118
have all the fun you want to

764
01:11:40,724 --> 01:11:43,626
My pining is soaring...

765
01:11:44,019 --> 01:11:47,467
how can l remain
in my senses?

766
01:11:47,859 --> 01:11:50,958
don't stop me anymore, my love

767
01:11:57,492 --> 01:12:04,399
O enemy...
it's a beautiful moment

768
01:12:04,851 --> 01:12:11,921
This youth craves
for your love

769
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:15,598
Take me in your arms...

770
01:12:16,307 --> 01:12:19,438
don't think of anything else

771
01:12:22,131 --> 01:12:25,001
Think of nothing else

772
01:12:37,555 --> 01:12:40,370
Tara's jumping on his feet!

773
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,990
Let me watch!

774
01:12:43,347 --> 01:12:47,024
Tara, you're on your feet...?
Are you out of your mind?

775
01:12:47,987 --> 01:12:49,874
What have l done?

776
01:12:50,259 --> 01:12:53,739
Tara! You're standing on your feet!

777
01:12:54,675 --> 01:12:57,010
l have cured you!

778
01:12:58,932 --> 01:13:01,168
Shake hands!
Tara has recovered!

779
01:13:01,491 --> 01:13:03,280
l guess, you guys
have gone blind

780
01:13:03,603 --> 01:13:07,116
He's standing on his feet!
Congratulations!

781
01:13:07,443 --> 01:13:10,542
Heed my prayer now, sirs!
l'm very poor man...

782
01:13:10,868 --> 01:13:12,777
with a mother, two brothers
and three sisters

783
01:13:13,107 --> 01:13:15,017
Get your mother married,
find jobs for your sisters...

784
01:13:15,219 --> 01:13:17,041
and get your brothers wedded.
- l can't get my mother married

785
01:13:17,203 --> 01:13:19,407
l'll deal with that. Go away.
- l can't get her married

786
01:13:19,731 --> 01:13:21,836
Get lost.
- Move it

787
01:13:26,515 --> 01:13:29,963
l'm feeling great love for you.
- Don't tell me

788
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:33,740
l wrote about fifty or sixty
duets for you

789
01:13:34,067 --> 01:13:37,547
And you stand up in a single duet?
- l'm a Punjabi, you know!

790
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:42,316
l can't hold! That's why
the girl's clean bowled!

791
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:51,955
Mr Cobra, your wound has healed,
the fracture has been set right too

792
01:13:52,307 --> 01:13:56,202
l've been asking you
to try and walk around

793
01:13:58,067 --> 01:14:00,936
You don't respond to anything l say.
- l can't walk, doctor

794
01:14:01,267 --> 01:14:04,529
At this rate, you'll never
be able to walk all your life

795
01:14:04,851 --> 01:14:06,761
You were hurt only in one leg...
- Watch it

796
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:10,475
l've read about a patient
in a medical journal

797
01:14:10,803 --> 01:14:14,065
He was crippled in both legs.
Only because of his will power...

798
01:14:14,387 --> 01:14:16,296
he can walk and move around today.
Read it

799
01:14:16,627 --> 01:14:20,075
l don't want to read it...
- For inspiration. Read it

800
01:14:26,259 --> 01:14:29,739
This is amazing inspiration

801
01:14:32,979 --> 01:14:37,681
Had you shown it to me earlier, l'd
have been running at the Asian Games

802
01:14:38,003 --> 01:14:40,873
l'd have won a medal for lndia.
- Good!

803
01:14:41,204 --> 01:14:44,073
l want to sit up.
- Certainly

804
01:14:44,403 --> 01:14:45,996
Open that.
- Of course

805
01:14:46,323 --> 01:14:48,046
l want to sit

806
01:14:54,003 --> 01:14:56,589
l can... sit up.
- Of course

807
01:14:56,883 --> 01:15:00,429
Let him keep lying, doctor.
Else, we'll be put to sleep

808
01:15:00,756 --> 01:15:05,066
Hush... this is the treatment.
- Doctor... can l stand?

809
01:15:05,427 --> 01:15:07,664
Of course!

810
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:12,331
Help me to my feet, doctor.
l want to stand

811
01:15:14,035 --> 01:15:17,810
Easy...
- l can stand!

812
01:15:18,996 --> 01:15:22,257
Let him sit, doctor.
- Shut up. He's being treated

813
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:24,849
Can l walk, doctor?
- Oh yes

814
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:26,344
Carefully

815
01:15:31,155 --> 01:15:33,163
You don't know him, doctor. ln a
little while, he'll ask if he can run!

816
01:15:33,492 --> 01:15:37,201
l think l can run, doctor.
- Of course you can run

817
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:40,723
Let him run... it's the cure.
- l can run

818
01:15:41,043 --> 01:15:42,320
Slowly

819
01:15:42,675 --> 01:15:45,839
He'll run away!
- Exactly! l want him to run

820
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:51,817
Let me go! l can run.
You are great, doctor

821
01:15:52,275 --> 01:15:56,399
Watch it... there's a glass-pane ahead.
- Stop him!

822
01:16:03,827 --> 01:16:05,769
Where has he gone?
- He has run away!

823
01:16:06,099 --> 01:16:09,514
l told you and you said
it was a cure!

824
01:16:09,843 --> 01:16:12,265
After him! Get him!

825
01:16:20,627 --> 01:16:23,923
Wait there... shoot him
in the leg!

826
01:16:27,156 --> 01:16:30,003
Not his legs, l've just
treated his leg

827
01:16:40,371 --> 01:16:45,128
Don't you think our life has changed,
ever since we've come here?

828
01:16:45,523 --> 01:16:50,345
lt has changed, no doubt.
We haven't committed any robbery...

829
01:16:50,708 --> 01:16:56,404
nor theft, nor picked a pocket.
- That's not what l'm talking about

830
01:16:56,787 --> 01:17:02,384
l'm talking about the moonlike beauty.
About Pinki, that is

831
01:17:02,707 --> 01:17:07,246
She picked me up from the wheelchair
and transported me to her heart

832
01:17:07,603 --> 01:17:12,654
l say, Tara. Priti's made a place
for herself in my heart

833
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:15,729
Why don't we live here then?

834
01:17:16,116 --> 01:17:21,517
Don't you think this is a much better
life than the one we led earlier?

835
01:17:21,843 --> 01:17:25,356
What did we have anyway?
Running away from the cops...

836
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:28,236
and Cobra?
- Don't even talk about Cobra!

837
01:17:29,523 --> 01:17:33,833
He's bitten us black and blue.
- l say, brother

838
01:17:35,027 --> 01:17:38,824
We'll swim across
this river of love

839
01:17:39,123 --> 01:17:42,952
Let's kick this wheelchair
together!

840
01:18:26,226 --> 01:18:27,720
124...

841
01:18:28,082 --> 01:18:29,675
125...

842
01:18:30,066 --> 01:18:31,528
126...

843
01:18:32,054 --> 01:18:33,552
127...

844
01:18:33,927 --> 01:18:35,576
128...

845
01:18:36,842 --> 01:18:40,736
What news have you brought
from Ram Singh?

846
01:18:47,885 --> 01:18:50,154
Have you had enough of the cells...

847
01:18:50,797 --> 01:18:53,831
that you've called me out
for a thrashing today?

848
01:18:54,797 --> 01:18:58,758
Even if you change the location,
you'll ask the same old questions

849
01:19:00,493 --> 01:19:05,763
Your first question: Where is the
ammunition you stole from the army?

850
01:19:08,045 --> 01:19:12,300
Your second question: Whom have
you sold the ammunition to?

851
01:19:14,701 --> 01:19:18,084
Third question:
Where is your hideout?

852
01:19:18,605 --> 01:19:21,671
Right...?
- You forgot my fourth question

853
01:19:22,381 --> 01:19:26,473
Where are your friends hiding?
- That question, l'll surely answer

854
01:19:28,269 --> 01:19:30,636
My friends are close by

855
01:19:31,437 --> 01:19:33,957
Plans to rescue me are also in place

856
01:19:36,077 --> 01:19:38,182
The day l'm free...

857
01:19:39,629 --> 01:19:42,116
you'll be finished, Ram Singh

858
01:19:42,797 --> 01:19:44,707
l'll give you the opportunity
right now

859
01:19:45,037 --> 01:19:47,011
Run away from here
and finish me

860
01:19:47,597 --> 01:19:49,834
You think you're very brave?

861
01:19:50,221 --> 01:19:52,393
Try crossing the main gate
and prove it

862
01:19:54,317 --> 01:19:57,187
l'm the only one standing
between you and your freedom

863
01:19:57,965 --> 01:20:00,070
No one will interfere

864
01:20:01,773 --> 01:20:04,140
With the handcuffs?
- Release him

865
01:20:09,837 --> 01:20:12,935
But remember something. lf l catch
you in the first attempt...

866
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:16,774
you're getting ten blows.
The second time... five

867
01:20:17,421 --> 01:20:20,235
ln the third attempt, you won't be
able to take even one blow

868
01:20:21,261 --> 01:20:22,209
Go on

869
01:20:27,085 --> 01:20:28,459
Soldiers...

870
01:20:29,229 --> 01:20:32,426
this is Ram Singh.
Nobody will stop Panther

871
01:20:32,781 --> 01:20:34,919
Let him go anywhere he wants to

872
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:47,656
Traitor! You threaten
a soldier with death?

873
01:22:08,397 --> 01:22:10,852
That was four blows, Ram Singh.
Just one to go, okay?

874
01:22:11,597 --> 01:22:13,736
Hit me.
- The final blow, eh?

875
01:22:20,237 --> 01:22:24,394
Ladies, listen...
l'm a very poor man

876
01:22:24,717 --> 01:22:26,954
l have a mother, three sisters
and two brothers

877
01:22:27,277 --> 01:22:30,473
All three have got to be married.
How would Tara and Sitara be...

878
01:22:30,797 --> 01:22:33,350
for two of my sisters?
- Not good at all

879
01:22:33,677 --> 01:22:36,939
What's wrong with them?
- Go and find other suitors

880
01:22:37,261 --> 01:22:42,018
l'll do that if l can leave the house.
You won't let me go anywhere

881
01:22:42,989 --> 01:22:45,542
By the way, why did you
say that, Priti?

882
01:22:45,901 --> 01:22:49,830
Obviously! He spoke of getting my
Sitara married to one of his sisters!

883
01:22:50,157 --> 01:22:53,637
Have you noticed his personality?
He's so handsome

884
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:36,843
With the glitter of gold...

885
01:23:43,053 --> 01:23:47,309
with the sparkle of silver...

886
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:57,003
it was when the juice
of roses was extracted...

887
01:23:59,661 --> 01:24:02,956
my beauty, my love...

888
01:24:04,685 --> 01:24:06,889
was created

889
01:24:35,629 --> 01:24:40,582
Those who look at me,
keep looking...

890
01:24:43,181 --> 01:24:47,524
l'm the one they always
think about

891
01:24:50,957 --> 01:24:54,121
Take me in your arms, my love...

892
01:24:55,821 --> 01:24:59,334
make love to me

893
01:25:00,717 --> 01:25:05,124
A bit concealed...

894
01:25:08,045 --> 01:25:12,714
the mischief of your beauty...

895
01:25:14,989 --> 01:25:18,786
it was when the juice
of roses was extracted...

896
01:25:22,061 --> 01:25:25,509
your beauty, my love...

897
01:25:27,213 --> 01:25:29,580
was crafted

898
01:25:39,917 --> 01:25:41,412
Psst to you!

899
01:25:41,837 --> 01:25:42,786
Back again!

900
01:25:43,021 --> 01:25:47,276
This is Cobra speaking.
- Lovely voice. Call for you

901
01:25:47,597 --> 01:25:50,467
Lovely voice...?
Must be my girlfriend

902
01:25:51,245 --> 01:25:53,154
Listen to the romantic chat
l have with her

903
01:25:54,989 --> 01:25:57,290
Where are you, darling?
- This is Cobra

904
01:25:57,613 --> 01:26:02,631
Which cobra is this?
ls it the one we defanged...

905
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:09,798
and made a public mockery of?
- This is Cobra, your father!

906
01:26:11,757 --> 01:26:15,139
lt was Cobra calling.
- l know

907
01:26:15,469 --> 01:26:17,738
Why did you give it to me then?
- l was scared

908
01:26:18,061 --> 01:26:21,378
l understand. l'm scared too.
- Let's sit down

909
01:26:22,829 --> 01:26:24,738
Could he still be on the line?

910
01:26:28,685 --> 01:26:29,929
Still holding

911
01:26:30,253 --> 01:26:32,391
Tara, Sitara...
please come and sit down

912
01:26:32,717 --> 01:26:34,822
Have something to eat,
why're you standing there?

913
01:26:36,557 --> 01:26:39,427
lf you're not hungry, could l have
some juice served to you?

914
01:26:41,293 --> 01:26:43,235
What's the matter, son?
You boys look worried

915
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:47,493
No worry...
it's just a bit of tension

916
01:26:47,853 --> 01:26:51,912
Actually, both of us had
the same nightmare last night

917
01:26:52,237 --> 01:26:56,874
A nightmare...? What was it about?
- We saw a snake... a cobra

918
01:26:57,677 --> 01:27:01,507
A venomous cobra.
- That's a very bad omen

919
01:27:02,189 --> 01:27:06,466
When you have a nightmare like that,
it means your enemy's after you

920
01:27:07,277 --> 01:27:12,679
But you needn't worry. Just find
a small snake and feed it some milk

921
01:27:13,037 --> 01:27:16,299
How about feeding Chhotu instead?
- Good idea

922
01:27:16,877 --> 01:27:22,628
The headlines: The dreaded terrorist
Cobra has escaped from police custody

923
01:27:26,029 --> 01:27:28,200
Cobra has escaped from jail
on several occasions earlier...

924
01:27:28,525 --> 01:27:30,314
and the police are looking for him

925
01:27:34,925 --> 01:27:38,503
Know when a terrorist breaks jail?
- When?

926
01:27:38,957 --> 01:27:41,510
When he wants to extract revenge
from his enemies

927
01:27:41,837 --> 01:27:45,350
l saw it in Sholay
Gabbar runs away from jail...

928
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:49,093
and takes revenge from his enemy.
Cobra's taking revenge too

929
01:27:49,997 --> 01:27:53,990
What's wrong with him...?
He hasn't even had any lunch

930
01:27:54,317 --> 01:27:56,870
He swallowed fear at breakfast

931
01:27:57,869 --> 01:28:01,349
But why are you trembling?
- As if l'd be afraid!

932
01:28:15,629 --> 01:28:19,426
Brother! Cobra is here!
- Hit him!

933
01:28:25,037 --> 01:28:27,590
What are you doing here
so early in the morning?

934
01:28:27,917 --> 01:28:32,140
That's my question. Why are you
sleeping here, instead of the bedroom?

935
01:28:32,461 --> 01:28:36,684
Moron! We are guests and
guests can sleep anywhere

936
01:28:37,037 --> 01:28:40,386
What are you doing here?
- Mr Ram Singh is leaving...

937
01:28:40,717 --> 01:28:44,361
for the outpost for a couple of days.
l came to clean the jeep

938
01:28:47,885 --> 01:28:49,794
And these guys sleep just anywhere

939
01:28:52,877 --> 01:28:56,707
Cobra wouldn't have come here,
for fear of confronting Ram Singh

940
01:28:57,037 --> 01:29:01,314
But if Ram Singh himself leaves,
what happens of our safety?

941
01:29:02,189 --> 01:29:04,523
Say something.
- Know what?

942
01:29:05,229 --> 01:29:06,952
l have an idea.
- Shoot

943
01:29:07,277 --> 01:29:09,644
Why don't we go to the border
with Ram Singh...

944
01:29:09,965 --> 01:29:13,031
and cross the fence
when we get the opportunity?

945
01:29:13,613 --> 01:29:15,587
What made you plan a trip
to the border with me?

946
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:18,634
We wanted to ask you something
about our character

947
01:29:18,957 --> 01:29:22,306
You ask him, brother.
- Me...? No, you ask him

948
01:29:22,637 --> 01:29:24,547
Go ahead and ask... what is it?

949
01:29:30,317 --> 01:29:32,227
Move it! Move!

950
01:29:33,197 --> 01:29:34,474
Freeze!

951
01:29:40,877 --> 01:29:42,088
Get in!

952
01:29:57,869 --> 01:29:59,429
Here they are

953
01:30:19,277 --> 01:30:23,107
Two more guys are coming

954
01:30:41,165 --> 01:30:42,310
Here you are

955
01:30:49,997 --> 01:30:51,907
lt won't go off.
- Try again

956
01:30:52,877 --> 01:30:54,787
lt went off,
but it didn't hit him

957
01:30:59,117 --> 01:31:01,321
The bullet hit his leg!

958
01:31:06,221 --> 01:31:10,150
From your face...

959
01:31:10,829 --> 01:31:14,953
take off the mask...

960
01:31:15,917 --> 01:31:18,536
dear sir

961
01:31:18,925 --> 01:31:21,347
Let the veil be,
do not take it off

962
01:31:21,677 --> 01:31:24,361
lf the veil is taken off...
- Big deal?

963
01:31:24,685 --> 01:31:27,140
You've got a bullet in the leg
and you're singing songs?

964
01:31:27,437 --> 01:31:29,925
What's so special about him?

965
01:31:43,757 --> 01:31:45,667
You've shot me in the leg!

966
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:49,229
You shot him in the leg again!
- lt's his mistake actually

967
01:31:49,517 --> 01:31:51,852
His face has value in police circles
and the public

968
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:54,082
But how will the public know
what's behind the mask?

969
01:31:54,413 --> 01:31:56,552
Let me drop the curtains
on your life!

970
01:31:58,157 --> 01:32:01,321
You don't even know...

971
01:32:01,709 --> 01:32:04,458
your days are getting over

972
01:32:04,877 --> 01:32:08,173
The impossible is
about to happen...

973
01:32:08,493 --> 01:32:11,243
start counting your days

974
01:32:11,597 --> 01:32:14,893
One, two, three, four...
- Five, six, seven, eight...

975
01:32:15,213 --> 01:32:18,312
add it up to eleven,
buddy boy

976
01:32:23,789 --> 01:32:26,953
One and one is eleven...

977
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:29,829
my friend

978
01:32:48,077 --> 01:32:50,314
l say...
- Tell me

979
01:32:50,637 --> 01:32:52,547
Why has Ram Singh brought us here?

980
01:32:52,877 --> 01:32:57,667
Looks like we're getting the
huge reward on Cobra's head

981
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:01,355
l've always thought that
the two of us are great men

982
01:33:01,677 --> 01:33:04,066
But time has always
prevented our success

983
01:33:04,397 --> 01:33:07,267
With times changing...
- Ram Singh will change too

984
01:33:10,157 --> 01:33:14,281
Welcome, Ram Singh.
What do you want to ask now?

985
01:33:14,605 --> 01:33:17,061
Not ask, l've come to
tell you something

986
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:20,833
What?

987
01:33:21,037 --> 01:33:26,471
Your brother Cobra, who wanted
to kidnap me and have you freed...

988
01:33:28,205 --> 01:33:29,993
has been killed

989
01:33:38,765 --> 01:33:40,674
l want to tell you something more

990
01:33:41,613 --> 01:33:44,395
lt wasn't me or
a soldier who killed him

991
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:47,908
He was slain by a couple
of brave civilians

992
01:33:55,981 --> 01:33:58,153
l've brought them with me,
so you can see...

993
01:33:58,477 --> 01:34:01,990
our civilians are no less
than soldiers

994
01:34:08,269 --> 01:34:10,756
ls this a death sentence for us?
- l don't know

995
01:34:11,405 --> 01:34:14,787
We always find happiness
to protect sorrow

996
01:34:15,117 --> 01:34:16,873
l don't know. l'm fed up

997
01:34:33,261 --> 01:34:38,476
Brother Panther, please don't pay
attention to what Ram Singh says

998
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:42,603
Whatever happened was an accident.
- lt sure was

999
01:34:42,989 --> 01:34:46,055
You could say brother Cobra
was destined to die

1000
01:34:48,461 --> 01:34:52,323
And isn't God kind? He snatched
one brother from you...

1001
01:34:52,653 --> 01:34:57,028
and gave you two brothers instead.
- Brothers. Buy one, get one free

1002
01:34:59,597 --> 01:35:01,507
Brother Panther,
please be patient

1003
01:35:02,189 --> 01:35:04,906
l will be patient

1004
01:35:05,261 --> 01:35:09,190
But your brother wasn't patient.
No wonder the scoundrel died!

1005
01:35:09,901 --> 01:35:11,811
The poor guy.
- Oh yes

1006
01:35:12,269 --> 01:35:14,538
The day l escape from here...

1007
01:35:16,877 --> 01:35:18,885
l'll dig your graves

1008
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:22,180
We're talking of patience
and he's talking of graves

1009
01:35:23,757 --> 01:35:26,604
Hold it. You might puke on his face

1010
01:35:36,301 --> 01:35:39,683
Why're you so sad?
Give me a smile

1011
01:35:41,645 --> 01:35:43,750
What do you think of that car?

1012
01:35:46,253 --> 01:35:48,227
Let me take you for a drive.
- Where?

1013
01:35:48,557 --> 01:35:50,467
Wherever destiny takes us

1014
01:36:02,765 --> 01:36:06,594
Let's think it over again. Will we be
able to live without Pinki and Priti?

1015
01:36:06,925 --> 01:36:08,387
No, brother don't!

1016
01:36:08,717 --> 01:36:12,743
We don't want to listen to the
tinkle of Pinki and Priti's bangles

1017
01:36:13,069 --> 01:36:15,108
We must heed the threat of Panther

1018
01:36:15,437 --> 01:36:18,023
Panther, who is caged...

1019
01:36:18,349 --> 01:36:22,724
he's baying for our blood

1020
01:36:23,117 --> 01:36:25,670
Turned your mind, didn't l?
- lf l say something...

1021
01:36:25,997 --> 01:36:28,332
you'll lose your mind too
- What?

1022
01:36:28,653 --> 01:36:30,409
The car is gone

1023
01:36:59,789 --> 01:37:04,394
We've lost the dough,
but the goddesses are here

1024
01:37:05,197 --> 01:37:08,612
Let's forget what is gone and
appreciate what's coming our way

1025
01:37:14,893 --> 01:37:17,511
For beauty, we burn
in the fires of passion

1026
01:37:17,837 --> 01:37:21,099
Like wax, we melt

1027
01:37:21,485 --> 01:37:24,551
We're crazy, we sway

1028
01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:27,853
We slip up
and steady ourselves

1029
01:37:28,205 --> 01:37:32,874
There's no one
quite like us...

1030
01:37:33,197 --> 01:37:35,270
my love...

1031
01:37:38,445 --> 01:37:40,867
One and one make eleven...

1032
01:37:41,837 --> 01:37:44,074
my love

1033
01:38:05,837 --> 01:38:07,942
Tara! Sitara!
Come on out!

1034
01:38:08,429 --> 01:38:13,218
What was that? Lightning? Thunder?
Or, has the roof come off?

1035
01:38:18,093 --> 01:38:20,776
What's up, son? What happened?
- l'm going to decide this today

1036
01:38:21,101 --> 01:38:23,687
Decide what?
- About Tara and Sitara's lives

1037
01:38:31,565 --> 01:38:34,434
You guys think l don't know
anything about you?

1038
01:38:34,765 --> 01:38:38,758
l know every thing. And today,
l've discovered your secret too

1039
01:38:39,085 --> 01:38:40,198
l say, Tara...

1040
01:38:40,525 --> 01:38:43,558
looks like the lid has been blown
off our bank robbery

1041
01:38:47,853 --> 01:38:49,576
Stand right here

1042
01:38:49,997 --> 01:38:52,234
What are you girls doing there?
Come here

1043
01:38:58,701 --> 01:38:59,878
Hurry up

1044
01:39:07,053 --> 01:39:09,835
Lovely couples

1045
01:39:10,925 --> 01:39:13,543
You think no one saw you
dancing and singing?

1046
01:39:19,533 --> 01:39:22,948
Every time l left for the border,
l always worried...

1047
01:39:23,277 --> 01:39:26,626
what would happen of my family,
if something happened to me

1048
01:39:29,069 --> 01:39:32,233
But l'm not worried anymore.
Even if something happens to me...

1049
01:39:32,557 --> 01:39:36,234
l know Tara and Sitara
will look after my family

1050
01:39:37,037 --> 01:39:41,827
l can't believe my luck that
l find such boys right at home

1051
01:39:46,221 --> 01:39:50,280
l'm so happy that you've finalised
a match for Priti and Pinki

1052
01:39:50,605 --> 01:39:53,027
Shouldn't you ask
Priti's parents too?

1053
01:39:53,357 --> 01:39:56,554
What's the problem? Take mother
and go over to their place

1054
01:39:57,197 --> 01:39:59,270
They won't find boys like these,
will they?

1055
01:40:00,077 --> 01:40:02,630
l'm so happy. lf Ram Singh
has sent the proposal...

1056
01:40:02,957 --> 01:40:06,787
it must be from a decent
and high ranking family

1057
01:40:07,469 --> 01:40:10,949
That's all right. But won't you
introduce the boys to us?

1058
01:40:11,597 --> 01:40:15,875
At once. Tara, Sitara...
don't feel shy

1059
01:40:16,205 --> 01:40:17,350
Come here

1060
01:40:21,357 --> 01:40:23,244
l say...

1061
01:40:24,077 --> 01:40:25,604
greetings

1062
01:40:28,813 --> 01:40:31,017
The brothers with
six bullets each

1063
01:40:32,973 --> 01:40:36,552
The same height and looks...
they'd look the same with beards

1064
01:40:37,261 --> 01:40:40,076
There were these scoundrels
who robbed my bank

1065
01:40:40,397 --> 01:40:44,227
These boys bear a striking
resemblance to those fellows

1066
01:40:44,557 --> 01:40:48,451
We look like scoundrels and criminals
to him, although we're well dressed

1067
01:40:48,781 --> 01:40:50,756
lmagine what he'd say if were
were dressed in kurta-pajama!

1068
01:40:51,085 --> 01:40:54,216
l can't tolerate this...
- But l can tolerate it

1069
01:40:54,541 --> 01:40:58,819
We don't want a proposal like this one!
- Let me go ahead, if you don't want it

1070
01:40:59,949 --> 01:41:01,094
Listen sons...

1071
01:41:01,517 --> 01:41:04,998
l was talking about
those two scoundrels

1072
01:41:05,357 --> 01:41:08,041
One of those scoundrels
looked just like you

1073
01:41:08,365 --> 01:41:10,536
He was talking of running
away with my daughter

1074
01:41:10,861 --> 01:41:13,228
Why're you calling us names
again and again?

1075
01:41:14,509 --> 01:41:19,527
l told you we must leave.
- l'm abusing those two chaps

1076
01:41:19,885 --> 01:41:23,267
But we're offended.
- Why?

1077
01:41:23,597 --> 01:41:27,110
Obviously. We look alike.
- l see

1078
01:41:28,173 --> 01:41:29,995
Now tell me, which one of you
is the thief?

1079
01:41:30,317 --> 01:41:31,943
Both, in fact

1080
01:41:32,269 --> 01:41:35,913
l want to know who's the thief
who stole my daughter's heart?

1081
01:41:36,237 --> 01:41:38,146
Who's my son-in-law?

1082
01:41:39,821 --> 01:41:42,156
l'm the one Mr Ram Singh sent.
- l see

1083
01:41:43,757 --> 01:41:47,751
Let's hurry up. l'm getting late.
- This is my watch!

1084
01:41:48,845 --> 01:41:52,074
lt's mine! With a T for Tara!
- No, T stands for Tiku

1085
01:41:52,397 --> 01:41:55,431
lt's Tara!
You'll now say this S is yours

1086
01:41:57,101 --> 01:42:01,030
This S is my wife's !
- S stands for Sitara

1087
01:42:01,997 --> 01:42:04,550
Tara and Sitara.
- Strange coincidence

1088
01:42:04,877 --> 01:42:06,787
We bought them.
We got the receipts too

1089
01:42:06,957 --> 01:42:11,267
Come, let's sweeten our tongue.
- After bitterness comes sweet

1090
01:42:11,597 --> 01:42:13,507
Come, my boys

1091
01:42:15,245 --> 01:42:17,154
We know, you make very
good porridge, don't you?

1092
01:42:17,485 --> 01:42:20,867
Also cauliflower pancakes!
- How did you get to know? How...?

1093
01:42:21,197 --> 01:42:24,426
How many times will you ask...?
We know everything

1094
01:42:24,749 --> 01:42:27,716
This is the hall, there's the bedroom,
and a bathroom with a commode

1095
01:42:28,077 --> 01:42:31,175
The safe's over there.
- And a table, on which...

1096
01:42:31,533 --> 01:42:32,711
Hold it!

1097
01:42:45,165 --> 01:42:48,481
Let's discuss it with Mr Ram Singh
and finalise a date for the wedding

1098
01:42:48,813 --> 01:42:50,471
Your car keys, sir

1099
01:42:50,957 --> 01:42:52,867
Brother...
- l say?

1100
01:42:56,717 --> 01:42:58,441
lt's a surprise!

1101
01:42:58,637 --> 01:42:59,750
Found it!

1102
01:43:00,077 --> 01:43:01,986
Why's he rolling over the bonnet?

1103
01:43:06,317 --> 01:43:08,390
Found it! The car!

1104
01:43:24,429 --> 01:43:28,138
Get the stuff out, l say.
lt's going to make our lives

1105
01:43:28,461 --> 01:43:29,737
One moment

1106
01:43:31,277 --> 01:43:32,554
Who...?

1107
01:43:33,645 --> 01:43:35,555
Your stuff is here

1108
01:43:37,037 --> 01:43:38,947
l'm getting it out.
- Your permanent stuff is here

1109
01:43:39,149 --> 01:43:41,059
You take care of her...
l'll attend to this

1110
01:43:44,717 --> 01:43:46,441
What happened?
- Carry on

1111
01:43:46,637 --> 01:43:50,412
What's happened to him?
- l'm feeling shy... Carry on

1112
01:43:50,733 --> 01:43:52,970
Why've you come to meet me
so late in the night?

1113
01:43:53,357 --> 01:43:56,740
l couldn't help it.
l've found my heart after ages

1114
01:43:57,325 --> 01:43:59,780
Get a hold on your heart...
it's only for a few days

1115
01:44:00,077 --> 01:44:03,373
No way. l've spent
so many days without it

1116
01:44:03,693 --> 01:44:05,832
l'm not letting it
slip out of my hands today

1117
01:44:06,413 --> 01:44:09,162
Go away, before someone comes here.
- Wide open

1118
01:44:09,485 --> 01:44:11,906
What?
- Doors... here and there

1119
01:44:16,077 --> 01:44:17,987
Who's that...?

1120
01:44:18,317 --> 01:44:20,227
Who is it? Tara and Sitara!

1121
01:44:20,557 --> 01:44:22,531
What are you doing here?
- This bag fell down.

1122
01:44:22,861 --> 01:44:24,716
We're putting it in

1123
01:44:25,677 --> 01:44:28,874
This is the bag in which those
thieves stuffed the loot!

1124
01:44:29,197 --> 01:44:33,059
You boys have found my money!
You've found the bag!

1125
01:44:33,389 --> 01:44:35,298
You're like Gods to me!

1126
01:44:35,661 --> 01:44:38,148
Tara, Sitara...
the two of you are great!

1127
01:44:38,477 --> 01:44:43,747
Give us the bag.
- You are great guys! You're angels!

1128
01:45:01,677 --> 01:45:03,749
Every Romeo has left

1129
01:45:06,189 --> 01:45:08,491
Every lover-boy has left

1130
01:45:10,733 --> 01:45:12,521
This isn't love...

1131
01:45:12,845 --> 01:45:14,633
it isn't about lovers...

1132
01:45:14,957 --> 01:45:17,096
you're no friend...

1133
01:45:17,421 --> 01:45:20,967
your love...
is treacherous love

1134
01:45:31,053 --> 01:45:33,192
Every Romeo has left

1135
01:45:35,693 --> 01:45:37,864
Every lover-boy has left

1136
01:45:40,205 --> 01:45:42,594
Let's not talk
about those crazy lovers

1137
01:45:44,621 --> 01:45:47,785
Those fireflies
are better forgotten

1138
01:45:49,037 --> 01:45:50,924
lt wasn't love...

1139
01:45:51,245 --> 01:45:53,994
it wasn't about lovers...

1140
01:45:54,317 --> 01:45:59,303
your love...
is treacherous love

1141
01:46:23,117 --> 01:46:26,216
Where's the show
of modesty anymore?

1142
01:46:27,693 --> 01:46:30,792
Where's the innocence
of yore?

1143
01:46:31,885 --> 01:46:33,892
The veil slips...

1144
01:46:34,381 --> 01:46:36,291
and nothing matters anymore

1145
01:46:36,557 --> 01:46:40,583
Nothing is sacred anymore,
the promises don't matter

1146
01:46:41,293 --> 01:46:44,555
Devastation is about to strike

1147
01:46:45,389 --> 01:46:48,073
Every Juliet has left...

1148
01:46:49,997 --> 01:46:52,453
every lover-girl has gone
into oblivion

1149
01:46:54,605 --> 01:46:57,223
Let's not talk
about those women...

1150
01:47:03,725 --> 01:47:08,810
it isn't love,
it isn't about lovers...

1151
01:47:09,197 --> 01:47:13,987
your love...
is full of deceit

1152
01:47:31,277 --> 01:47:32,870
Call the lover boy

1153
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:34,790
Call lover-girl

1154
01:47:35,117 --> 01:47:36,644
Call Romeo

1155
01:47:37,069 --> 01:47:38,662
Call Juliet over

1156
01:47:39,917 --> 01:47:41,827
Summon Sohni,
call Mahiwal

1157
01:47:42,029 --> 01:47:44,200
Bring Paro
and Devdas here

1158
01:47:44,525 --> 01:47:48,354
How many of them
will you bring...?

1159
01:47:51,437 --> 01:47:54,536
This is love only in name

1160
01:47:55,917 --> 01:47:59,114
What good is this joy?

1161
01:48:00,429 --> 01:48:04,226
When you're heart-broken,
left in the lurch

1162
01:48:04,653 --> 01:48:08,395
When your trust is betrayed...

1163
01:48:08,781 --> 01:48:12,261
The love in your eyes
is make believe

1164
01:48:13,517 --> 01:48:14,728
Every drunken lover has gone

1165
01:48:18,061 --> 01:48:20,549
Those special people
are no more

1166
01:48:22,829 --> 01:48:25,796
Don't even talk of
folk singers...

1167
01:48:27,149 --> 01:48:30,019
nor those who set
examples in true love

1168
01:48:31,757 --> 01:48:36,940
lt isn't about love,
or the beloved...

1169
01:48:37,261 --> 01:48:41,517
your love is treacherous

1170
01:49:10,445 --> 01:49:13,031
Love...

1171
01:49:21,677 --> 01:49:24,230
Brother, l don't believe it.
He looked like Cobra

1172
01:49:24,557 --> 01:49:26,467
Was he Cobra himself?

1173
01:49:32,237 --> 01:49:35,750
What a shameless man!
We threw you off the cliff...

1174
01:49:36,077 --> 01:49:38,947
and you still climb up?
- There was water down there...?

1175
01:49:39,277 --> 01:49:43,554
There was nothing.
God saved me

1176
01:49:43,885 --> 01:49:46,754
And now, you guys will do
just as l ask you to

1177
01:49:47,469 --> 01:49:49,924
Why would God save him?
- Ask Him

1178
01:49:50,253 --> 01:49:53,100
Why would we listen to you?

1179
01:49:53,453 --> 01:49:55,788
We have always done the bidding
of only one person

1180
01:49:56,109 --> 01:50:00,070
Our mother!
- Your mother? Talk to her

1181
01:50:01,741 --> 01:50:03,170
Let me talk

1182
01:50:07,469 --> 01:50:09,836
Mother...? Why are you crying?

1183
01:50:10,157 --> 01:50:13,954
My son, these scoundrels have
kidnapped me and brought me here

1184
01:50:14,285 --> 01:50:16,838
Where are the two of you?
- Brother, Mother's crying

1185
01:50:17,165 --> 01:50:19,019
Mother... are you all right?

1186
01:50:19,277 --> 01:50:24,842
These scoundrels have given me
nothing to eat... the rascals

1187
01:50:25,133 --> 01:50:27,337
Mother!
- Just you listen!

1188
01:50:27,725 --> 01:50:31,270
We're going to ruin your life,
you filthy...

1189
01:50:38,344 --> 01:50:42,173
Chhotu, you've brought uncle today?
- He wanted to see the regiment

1190
01:50:42,567 --> 01:50:45,055
Go ahead and show him around.
Go on

1191
01:50:46,024 --> 01:50:48,260
This way, Uncle... this way

1192
01:50:50,824 --> 01:50:52,547
See the clout l wield?

1193
01:50:53,704 --> 01:50:56,387
l'm no lesser than Mr Ram Singh

1194
01:50:56,936 --> 01:50:59,750
Had you come alone, they've have
turned you away from the gate

1195
01:51:00,103 --> 01:51:03,300
They wouldn't have let you in, even
though you're Tara and Sitara's uncle

1196
01:51:04,264 --> 01:51:07,395
Chhotu's the one they respect!

1197
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:11,229
Nothing's happening to you
till you're with me

1198
01:51:11,623 --> 01:51:14,558
Come straight after me.
Don't turn anywhere...

1199
01:52:04,327 --> 01:52:07,623
Don't shoot! l'm not an enemy...
l'm Major Ram Singh's relative

1200
01:52:07,943 --> 01:52:09,285
Major Ram Singh's relative

1201
01:52:12,872 --> 01:52:17,214
l'm glad you've arrived...
or your guys would've shot me

1202
01:52:17,607 --> 01:52:19,680
Yes, they would.
This is restricted area

1203
01:52:19,911 --> 01:52:21,886
We have orders to shoot
at strangers

1204
01:52:22,024 --> 01:52:25,537
Major, you have very tight
security here. What's up?

1205
01:52:26,183 --> 01:52:28,736
We're holding a very dangerous
criminal here. Panther

1206
01:52:29,704 --> 01:52:31,940
Panther, did you say?

1207
01:52:32,711 --> 01:52:36,094
He's the criminal whose brother
my nephews have killed!

1208
01:52:36,487 --> 01:52:40,578
He has threatened to
come out of jail and...

1209
01:52:40,968 --> 01:52:44,677
Not to worry, Uncle.
He can never escape

1210
01:52:45,127 --> 01:52:47,036
Not only do we have
very tight security...

1211
01:52:47,303 --> 01:52:51,394
the keys to the cell in which he's
locked is always in my custody

1212
01:52:51,784 --> 01:52:53,693
lt's safely kept
in my safe at home

1213
01:53:06,632 --> 01:53:08,868
Caught you, didn't l?
- What do you mean?

1214
01:53:09,383 --> 01:53:13,212
l know why you're secretly
moving around at this moment

1215
01:53:13,671 --> 01:53:15,460
What for?
- To steal

1216
01:53:15,911 --> 01:53:17,951
Steal...?
- Afraid, aren't you?

1217
01:53:18,247 --> 01:53:21,346
But you won't find anything there.
- Where ?

1218
01:53:21,607 --> 01:53:23,843
ln the kitchen.
You're hungry, aren't you?

1219
01:53:27,111 --> 01:53:29,020
You're hungry, right?
- Yes

1220
01:53:29,224 --> 01:53:30,500
l'll go and cook something.
- Hush!

1221
01:53:31,144 --> 01:53:34,013
All are sleeping.
- May l go and cook something for you?

1222
01:53:34,407 --> 01:53:36,262
My hunger has vanished

1223
01:53:37,479 --> 01:53:39,235
Go on. Go

1224
01:54:44,104 --> 01:54:45,478
Dad! Mom!

1225
01:54:46,343 --> 01:54:49,376
What happened?
Let them sleep

1226
01:54:49,927 --> 01:54:52,742
l've got to leave early for school.
lf l don't carry my fees...

1227
01:54:53,063 --> 01:54:55,616
my teacher's going to kill me.
- So take the money from Mummy's purse

1228
01:54:56,007 --> 01:54:58,112
But let them sleep. Go ahead

1229
01:55:15,847 --> 01:55:18,051
Where does Mummy
keep her purse?

1230
01:55:20,263 --> 01:55:22,173
She leaves the cupboard open!

1231
01:55:28,264 --> 01:55:33,599
Moron, you can't see anything.
- The purse is in the cupboard

1232
01:55:34,024 --> 01:55:38,431
lt's not there!
You take a look

1233
01:55:38,824 --> 01:55:40,733
lf l find the purse,
l'm going to fix you good

1234
01:55:53,991 --> 01:55:56,412
lt's right here

1235
01:55:58,247 --> 01:56:00,581
What's this ?
- l couldn't see it

1236
01:56:00,904 --> 01:56:02,813
Can you ever see anything
except food?

1237
01:56:03,143 --> 01:56:05,118
You'll find the rossogollas,
wherever they are

1238
01:56:30,408 --> 01:56:31,618
Tara...
- Yes, Sitara

1239
01:56:31,943 --> 01:56:35,140
Cobra's disappeared.
- He must be in the loo

1240
01:56:35,464 --> 01:56:37,373
He's not there.
- He's dark-skinned...

1241
01:56:37,703 --> 01:56:39,940
switch on the lights,
you'll find him

1242
01:56:40,264 --> 01:56:42,565
Get up, will you?
- What rubbish is this?

1243
01:56:42,888 --> 01:56:44,862
Let me sleep.
- l'm feeling scared!

1244
01:56:45,191 --> 01:56:47,613
Scared...? Scared of what?
- Cobra's not gone...

1245
01:56:47,944 --> 01:56:51,905
to free Panther, has he?
- lf he goes to free Panther...

1246
01:56:52,232 --> 01:56:55,101
it's good news for us.
He'll fall to the security's bullets

1247
01:56:55,431 --> 01:56:57,024
The bloody...
- Rat!

1248
01:56:57,351 --> 01:56:59,904
Not rat, the bloody...
- Rat!

1249
01:57:00,231 --> 01:57:02,849
Yes... rat!
- No, my boys

1250
01:57:03,175 --> 01:57:07,136
lf l die, who'll give you
the whereabouts of your mother?

1251
01:57:07,463 --> 01:57:11,292
Tell us something... where did you
disappear in the middle of the night?

1252
01:57:13,799 --> 01:57:16,996
To have this key made.
- lsn't that a key we heard of?

1253
01:57:17,319 --> 01:57:21,214
You mean we saw it earlier.
- We've broken so many locks

1254
01:57:21,544 --> 01:57:26,333
Must be the key to one of them.
- This is the key to Panther's freedom

1255
01:57:29,351 --> 01:57:31,588
Why has he thrown
the key in our face?

1256
01:57:31,911 --> 01:57:33,820
Explain this... why have you
thrown the key in our face?

1257
01:57:34,024 --> 01:57:37,985
l'll tell you. Because...
why did you throw it?

1258
01:57:38,312 --> 01:57:44,225
With that key, you're going to
free my brother Panther tonight

1259
01:57:44,584 --> 01:57:47,584
Why will the two of us
free your brother?

1260
01:57:48,135 --> 01:57:52,707
Because if you refuse to do that,
the Sun will rise tomorrow...

1261
01:57:53,031 --> 01:57:55,398
but your poor mother will
not see the new dawn

1262
01:57:55,815 --> 01:57:58,662
You're a bloody...
- Rat!

1263
01:57:58,984 --> 01:58:01,853
We'll do it for you...
let's shake paws!

1264
01:58:14,344 --> 01:58:16,897
Lower the beam.
- Tara?

1265
01:58:17,224 --> 01:58:21,152
Can't be you in both places, can you?
The officer's here, open up quickly

1266
01:58:22,024 --> 01:58:23,933
Raise the barrier. Quick

1267
01:59:01,191 --> 01:59:04,060
Mr Ram Singh's car?
- He has just arrived

1268
01:59:04,968 --> 01:59:06,494
At this hour?

1269
01:59:10,791 --> 01:59:13,060
Must l awaken him?
- With love

1270
01:59:13,864 --> 01:59:14,944
Shall l?

1271
01:59:16,744 --> 01:59:18,337
l say, brother!

1272
01:59:18,664 --> 01:59:20,551
Brother Panther...

1273
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:23,141
He's not reacting,
he's not dead, is he?

1274
01:59:23,464 --> 01:59:25,885
Say nice things...
let me try

1275
01:59:26,344 --> 01:59:30,948
Brother Panther...
you're not dead, are you?

1276
01:59:32,104 --> 01:59:34,657
You're the ones who are
going to die. At my hands

1277
01:59:34,984 --> 01:59:36,445
You can't escape

1278
01:59:44,519 --> 01:59:46,112
Tara and Sitara?

1279
01:59:47,687 --> 01:59:49,476
We're helpless

1280
01:59:53,991 --> 01:59:55,267
Open the handcuff

1281
02:00:03,015 --> 02:00:07,455
l've found a truck driver.
We've got to leave in an hour

1282
02:00:07,783 --> 02:00:12,485
Where are we going?
- Wherever the truck takes us

1283
02:00:12,807 --> 02:00:15,874
You know, we have no place of our own.
- But...

1284
02:00:16,647 --> 02:00:20,477
we've ended up doing
something very horrible

1285
02:00:23,175 --> 02:00:25,728
What happened?
What is it, Mother?

1286
02:00:26,152 --> 02:00:29,119
What happened, Mother?
- l'm responsible for what you did

1287
02:00:29,895 --> 02:00:33,921
To save my life, the two of you
have risked your lives

1288
02:00:36,519 --> 02:00:39,366
Even my own children
wouldn't love me so much

1289
02:00:39,687 --> 02:00:44,477
Why are you harping on that?
You're hurting our feelings

1290
02:00:46,215 --> 02:00:48,222
Have we loved her any less
than our own mother?

1291
02:00:48,551 --> 02:00:51,966
Listen to me, Mother.
What's one lifetime...

1292
02:00:52,295 --> 02:00:55,361
we could sacrifice
ten lifetimes for you

1293
02:00:59,655 --> 02:01:02,404
What is the matter?
- We have some questions for you, sir

1294
02:01:02,727 --> 02:01:04,800
l'm sorry, l can't
talk to you

1295
02:01:05,607 --> 02:01:07,517
We're told you've been suspended

1296
02:01:09,127 --> 02:01:11,680
Two wanted thieves lived in your
house and you didn't even suspect...

1297
02:01:12,007 --> 02:01:14,877
their mission was to rescue Panther?
You're such a big officer...

1298
02:01:15,207 --> 02:01:18,339
you hold such an important post...
how could you be deceived, sir?

1299
02:01:18,791 --> 02:01:22,397
Apart from being an officer,
l'm also an lndian

1300
02:01:22,588 --> 02:01:26,101
We lndians have a huge weakness

1301
02:01:27,388 --> 02:01:30,258
We're very emotional

1302
02:01:32,188 --> 02:01:36,793
When a poor man comes to our door,
we share our food with him...

1303
02:01:37,148 --> 02:01:39,865
without even finding out
whether he's hungry or not

1304
02:01:40,188 --> 02:01:42,097
When someone comes seeking shelter...

1305
02:01:42,428 --> 02:01:46,389
we give him shelter in our house,
without finding out...

1306
02:01:46,748 --> 02:01:49,781
what lies in his heart

1307
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:56,471
l was blind to have
wished to marry Tara

1308
02:01:57,148 --> 02:02:01,371
How was l to know that the man
l wanted as my life-companion...

1309
02:02:01,692 --> 02:02:05,402
would ruin my brother's
life some day

1310
02:02:15,388 --> 02:02:18,901
To save their mother's life, Tara
and Sitara had Panther released...

1311
02:02:19,228 --> 02:02:24,018
but it was poor Ram Singh
who had to bear the punishment

1312
02:02:24,348 --> 02:02:27,861
As someone truly said, he paid for
the sins the boys had committed

1313
02:02:34,588 --> 02:02:37,785
What are you doing...?
What?

1314
02:02:38,428 --> 02:02:40,698
You were the one who
always lent us courage

1315
02:02:41,020 --> 02:02:44,914
And we stand by you today.
We are with you

1316
02:02:47,068 --> 02:02:50,713
Dad, whenever l didn't
do well at my studies...

1317
02:02:51,036 --> 02:02:53,458
or was found lacking
in sports and games...

1318
02:02:53,788 --> 02:02:58,261
you were the one who always told me,
A soldier's son must never give up

1319
02:02:58,652 --> 02:03:02,165
lf the one who gave me hope
himself gives up...

1320
02:03:02,492 --> 02:03:05,841
what will happen of us?
- My son...

1321
02:03:06,268 --> 02:03:08,952
your father never gave up,
nor will he ever

1322
02:03:10,684 --> 02:03:13,237
No enemy has ever escaped
my eyes

1323
02:03:14,684 --> 02:03:16,986
What l regret is that those two
enemies lived in my own house...

1324
02:03:17,308 --> 02:03:19,064
and escaped my scrutiny

1325
02:03:19,484 --> 02:03:21,426
No, sir...

1326
02:03:22,364 --> 02:03:24,503
l'm the guilty one!

1327
02:03:25,532 --> 02:03:31,958
They made me tell them
everything about the family

1328
02:03:32,284 --> 02:03:37,074
l'd rather you shoot me, sir!
- Chhotu!

1329
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:43,377
l'll kill those who have
betrayed all of us

1330
02:03:47,324 --> 02:03:48,502
Bastards!

1331
02:03:51,772 --> 02:03:53,682
Whom did the bullet hit?
- Not me

1332
02:04:00,988 --> 02:04:05,145
Tara, we came here to explain
our situation to him

1333
02:04:05,596 --> 02:04:07,701
But he's shooting at us
even before we can speak

1334
02:04:08,668 --> 02:04:16,404
l think this crisis that goes on
and on in our lives...

1335
02:04:17,116 --> 02:04:20,858
Mr Ram Singh, if you could hear
us out before you shoot at us?

1336
02:04:21,180 --> 02:04:22,489
l want to listen to nothing!

1337
02:04:22,812 --> 02:04:24,700
Nobody moves! Else, l'll shoot

1338
02:04:24,988 --> 02:04:28,501
Madam, you step here...
it's a request

1339
02:04:28,828 --> 02:04:30,738
You come here, brother

1340
02:04:33,628 --> 02:04:37,141
You're kidnapping me...?
- l swear it on God!

1341
02:04:37,468 --> 02:04:40,021
Nobody moves!
Else, l'll shoot the old lady!

1342
02:04:40,348 --> 02:04:42,388
Dad! Save Grandma!
- Have patience

1343
02:04:42,716 --> 02:04:46,491
Fatso, not even your father
can save your grandma!

1344
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:48,471
You know what that means?

1345
02:04:49,948 --> 02:04:51,858
Not a word against Dad!
- Patience

1346
02:04:52,156 --> 02:04:56,346
Sir, even if l die,
l'm going to fix these guys!

1347
02:04:56,668 --> 02:04:59,189
Cut that bloody crap!

1348
02:04:59,548 --> 02:05:01,785
You have a mother, two brothers
and three sisters

1349
02:05:02,108 --> 02:05:04,345
You're going to die without
getting them married?

1350
02:05:06,364 --> 02:05:10,642
Not my Mother...
- Your sisters will remain unmarried

1351
02:05:10,973 --> 02:05:14,268
l'll see how you don't
get your mother married!

1352
02:05:14,620 --> 02:05:18,198
No tricks, please.
- No smartness... no

1353
02:05:18,556 --> 02:05:22,385
l'm not playing any tricks.
l'll do just as you say

1354
02:05:22,716 --> 02:05:25,138
Only let my mother go

1355
02:05:25,468 --> 02:05:29,527
See? lt kills you, doesn't it?

1356
02:05:29,884 --> 02:05:33,146
That's how mothers are

1357
02:05:33,852 --> 02:05:36,667
Just as your love for your mother
makes you helpless...

1358
02:05:36,988 --> 02:05:39,988
the two of us were helpless too.
- True

1359
02:05:40,828 --> 02:05:46,993
Cobra had kidnapped our mother.
He asked us to have Panther freed

1360
02:05:47,324 --> 02:05:50,870
Had we not had Panther freed,
the scoundrel...

1361
02:05:51,196 --> 02:05:52,886
The bastard!
- The sonofagun...

1362
02:05:53,213 --> 02:05:54,936
the bloody owl...
- The ape!

1363
02:05:55,228 --> 02:05:58,545
Come to the point.
- He'd have killed our mother

1364
02:05:58,876 --> 02:06:04,407
How could we give death to the
mother who gave us our lives?

1365
02:06:04,828 --> 02:06:06,552
Don't cry, Tara...

1366
02:06:12,252 --> 02:06:14,424
Give me the gun.
- What's the problem?

1367
02:06:18,268 --> 02:06:24,019
Mr Ram Singh, we enacted this drama
to make you see the truth

1368
02:06:24,796 --> 02:06:28,243
lf you still don't trust us,
take this gun...

1369
02:06:28,572 --> 02:06:31,387
and shoot us!
- What are you doing?

1370
02:06:31,708 --> 02:06:35,221
lf you must give the gun to someone,
give it to the mother...

1371
02:06:35,548 --> 02:06:40,021
she has a mother's heart!
And Ram Singh is only her son

1372
02:06:40,348 --> 02:06:43,415
Mr Ram Singh, please forgive us

1373
02:06:43,900 --> 02:06:46,769
Circumstances have driven us
to commit these bad deeds

1374
02:06:47,164 --> 02:06:51,190
But we're not bad human beings.
- Mr Ram Singh...

1375
02:06:51,612 --> 02:06:55,387
we've never wanted to
ruin anyone's family

1376
02:06:55,740 --> 02:06:57,911
Give us just one chance

1377
02:06:58,332 --> 02:07:01,681
We're the ones who set Panther free.
We'll be the ones to bring him back

1378
02:07:02,012 --> 02:07:04,979
That's not all.
Let me tell you, Mr Ram Singh

1379
02:07:05,308 --> 02:07:10,742
The respect and the happiness your
family has lost because of us...

1380
02:07:11,068 --> 02:07:15,541
we brothers will restore to you.
- That's not all

1381
02:07:15,868 --> 02:07:21,106
Just give us one more opportunity.
That's all there is to it

1382
02:07:23,453 --> 02:07:25,689
l see truth in what you say

1383
02:07:26,364 --> 02:07:28,503
Go on. l give you an opportunity

1384
02:07:38,012 --> 02:07:41,328
Pinki, l saw your interview
on television

1385
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:45,177
You said that you're blind

1386
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:51,122
Had you been blind, where would you
have found a handsome man like me?

1387
02:07:52,092 --> 02:07:56,468
l have a request...
please accept me

1388
02:07:59,068 --> 02:08:00,017
No?

1389
02:08:00,893 --> 02:08:04,821
She's willing, because she's shy.
- Don't tell me!

1390
02:08:06,812 --> 02:08:13,271
Please telephone Priti and tell her
that Sitara has turned a new leaf

1391
02:08:14,236 --> 02:08:18,262
And do tell yourself too, that
your Tara has also turned a new leaf

1392
02:08:19,228 --> 02:08:20,177
One moment

1393
02:08:21,788 --> 02:08:25,301
l called you a fatso.
- But he is a fatso

1394
02:08:28,828 --> 02:08:34,262
Brother, we made tall claims and
spoke impressive lines in there

1395
02:08:34,588 --> 02:08:37,850
But where are we going
to look for Panther?

1396
02:08:38,172 --> 02:08:42,067
You played the lion
from Punjab in there

1397
02:08:42,588 --> 02:08:45,904
You spoke of restoring the family's
happiness and honour

1398
02:08:46,236 --> 02:08:51,025
Can't help it. lt's the Punjabi blood
which is forever on the boil

1399
02:08:51,644 --> 02:08:54,164
But what are we going to do now?
- Brother...

1400
02:08:55,452 --> 02:08:57,624
that was the way mother showed us

1401
02:08:58,332 --> 02:09:00,504
A way out of this,
mother will show us too

1402
02:09:03,132 --> 02:09:04,725
Mother!

1403
02:09:12,028 --> 02:09:14,581
Tara, Sitara... the two scoundrels...
- What are you saying, Mother?

1404
02:09:14,908 --> 02:09:17,210
This is the place those two
scoundrels brought me to

1405
02:09:17,532 --> 02:09:21,078
Amazing! She has brought us
to the enemy's den!

1406
02:09:21,404 --> 02:09:24,306
That's how a mother is.
- Enough

1407
02:09:24,636 --> 02:09:26,840
This is no time for emotions,
it's action time

1408
02:09:27,164 --> 02:09:29,073
Go and keep your promise

1409
02:09:29,308 --> 02:09:33,651
Go and inform Ram Singh.
ln the meantime, we'll fix these guys

1410
02:09:33,980 --> 02:09:35,573
Watch it!

1411
02:09:36,028 --> 02:09:38,484
Mother! You've learnt to drive?

1412
02:09:41,596 --> 02:09:45,305
Mother has learnt to drive, brother.
- That's how a mother is

1413
02:09:45,628 --> 02:09:46,774
Right

1414
02:09:53,980 --> 02:09:58,388
l'm leaving your country, so l thought
l'd say bye to you one last time

1415
02:09:59,804 --> 02:10:02,259
You did throw your weight around
in that uniform

1416
02:10:02,716 --> 02:10:06,327
You will now bow your head
out of shame all your life

1417
02:10:07,708 --> 02:10:10,578
You asked me many questions
in custody

1418
02:10:11,036 --> 02:10:13,458
But Panther has the last word

1419
02:10:18,012 --> 02:10:20,184
Have you set the landmines?
- Yes

1420
02:10:20,956 --> 02:10:23,061
And the bombs?
- Yes sir

1421
02:10:24,028 --> 02:10:28,501
Not a trace of evidence
we leave behind

1422
02:10:31,708 --> 02:10:35,124
We've loaded the stuff.
So let's move

1423
02:10:42,780 --> 02:10:45,333
Stop the van!
Chase!

1424
02:10:46,812 --> 02:10:48,405
l'm so happy today

1425
02:10:48,732 --> 02:10:52,507
Without any bloodshed,
or doing anything wrong...

1426
02:10:52,828 --> 02:10:55,381
we've done something great
for the country

1427
02:10:55,708 --> 02:10:58,010
l'm so happy!
- Drive the van!

1428
02:10:58,332 --> 02:11:02,424
l feel like crying.
- Concentrate, will you?

1429
02:11:03,132 --> 02:11:04,856
Overtake the van!

1430
02:11:05,308 --> 02:11:06,585
Hold it!

1431
02:11:07,228 --> 02:11:11,058
Right or left? Where do we go?
- This is the first time...

1432
02:11:11,388 --> 02:11:14,584
we've done something right,
so take a right

1433
02:11:14,908 --> 02:11:17,559
That guy's gonna fall

1434
02:11:23,676 --> 02:11:26,840
l'm very excited today.
- Why?

1435
02:11:27,164 --> 02:11:31,834
Ram Singh will happily get us married.
After that...

1436
02:11:32,188 --> 02:11:38,899
we'll have kids from Pinki and Priti.
- Concentrate on the wheels!

1437
02:11:41,788 --> 02:11:45,301
What do l take now?
Right or left?

1438
02:11:59,772 --> 02:12:05,272
l'm even more excited.
- No excitement. Drive the van!

1439
02:12:05,596 --> 02:12:08,465
Listen...
- No, drive the van

1440
02:12:19,133 --> 02:12:22,100
l say... have we returned
to the same place?

1441
02:12:24,988 --> 02:12:28,818
You kept saying right and
brought us to the wrong place

1442
02:12:30,748 --> 02:12:34,044
When the time is right,
you come to the right place

1443
02:12:34,364 --> 02:12:36,819
Your time isn't right.
Ours is

1444
02:12:37,468 --> 02:12:38,875
Get the clowns

1445
02:12:39,196 --> 02:12:42,262
Strange story...

1446
02:12:43,485 --> 02:12:47,063
it begins and ends

1447
02:12:48,028 --> 02:12:51,411
What destination...
- You can't sing! Not you!

1448
02:12:55,484 --> 02:12:57,393
Who told you to suggest
so many rights!

1449
02:12:57,628 --> 02:13:01,687
You were the one who was driving.
- And who asked me to take right?

1450
02:13:03,164 --> 02:13:05,914
He couldn't understand,
nor could l...

1451
02:13:06,268 --> 02:13:09,138
What destination...?
- Not you! You can't sing!

1452
02:13:10,108 --> 02:13:13,621
Skip the nonsense.
- No nonsense, you don't know

1453
02:13:14,620 --> 02:13:19,508
This chap creates the trouble
and lands me in the soup

1454
02:13:19,868 --> 02:13:22,039
l create the trouble?
- Oh yes

1455
02:13:22,364 --> 02:13:26,423
Brother Panther, ask brother Cobra
who shot him in the leg

1456
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:29,304
lt was him!
- One moment

1457
02:13:29,852 --> 02:13:33,147
Where was the need to say that?
Landed me in trouble again

1458
02:13:33,660 --> 02:13:36,594
Even if l shot at you,
who gave the gun to me?

1459
02:13:36,988 --> 02:13:39,323
lt was him!
- One moment!

1460
02:13:39,676 --> 02:13:43,254
Where was the need to say that?
All right, never mind

1461
02:13:43,580 --> 02:13:47,541
Ask him who gave him those kicks
and took him to the corner?

1462
02:13:48,188 --> 02:13:51,385
lt was him!
- One moment...

1463
02:13:52,156 --> 02:13:53,978
l forgot what l had to say...

1464
02:13:54,268 --> 02:13:58,392
where was the need to say that?
Oh yes, even if l pushed you around...

1465
02:13:58,812 --> 02:14:01,300
who was the one who
gave him the final kick

1466
02:14:01,820 --> 02:14:05,136
Who was it?
Who kicked you?

1467
02:14:08,284 --> 02:14:10,007
Who kicked you?

1468
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:13,780
Both of us had kicked him.

1469
02:14:16,700 --> 02:14:19,035
Both of them had kicked me.
- l'm not sparing them!

1470
02:14:19,324 --> 02:14:20,885
Get them!

1471
02:14:34,332 --> 02:14:37,628
Where has the grenade disappeared?
- Why didn't it explode?

1472
02:14:38,428 --> 02:14:40,665
lt hasn't gone into a coma, has it?

1473
02:14:50,908 --> 02:14:52,632
There... gotcha!

1474
02:14:52,956 --> 02:14:56,022
Kick it. lt's been years
since we played soccer

1475
02:15:01,180 --> 02:15:03,929
l'm David Beckham!
- No, l'm David Beckham!

1476
02:15:04,253 --> 02:15:07,548
lt's me!
- Me!

1477
02:15:08,956 --> 02:15:11,825
What are they up to?
- They're playing with the bomb!

1478
02:15:12,860 --> 02:15:16,821
All right, l'm Ronaldo

1479
02:15:17,596 --> 02:15:18,424
Kick it

1480
02:15:18,748 --> 02:15:20,341
l'm Ronaldo!

1481
02:15:20,668 --> 02:15:23,538
How can you be Ronaldo and
David Beckham? That's not happening

1482
02:15:27,132 --> 02:15:30,394
They're coming for us...
- Let go!

1483
02:15:47,068 --> 02:15:48,824
Tara and Sitara...

1484
02:15:50,236 --> 02:15:52,886
scored a goal.
C'mon!

1485
02:15:57,820 --> 02:15:59,281
Find them!

1486
02:16:01,756 --> 02:16:03,861
Find them! Move it!

1487
02:16:11,292 --> 02:16:15,995
We're hiding in the tank, no doubt.
But can you drive it ?

1488
02:16:16,348 --> 02:16:19,545
l can't even ride a bicycle
and you talk about a tank?

1489
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:21,842
l'm only talking out of tension,
don't get worked up

1490
02:16:22,172 --> 02:16:24,790
l once pushed a handcart,
but l can't even do that now

1491
02:16:30,492 --> 02:16:32,402
They're in the tank!

1492
02:16:44,284 --> 02:16:48,310
What's happening here?
- What's going on?

1493
02:16:50,012 --> 02:16:53,459
The headphone...
listen to the news

1494
02:16:55,548 --> 02:16:56,977
Kill them!

1495
02:16:57,533 --> 02:17:00,828
What happened?
- They say they're going to kill us

1496
02:17:01,148 --> 02:17:04,083
Brother! l'm so scared

1497
02:17:07,996 --> 02:17:11,443
Numbers... ever played roulette?
- Yes

1498
02:17:11,836 --> 02:17:14,618
Try a lucky number.
- One moment

1499
02:17:16,828 --> 02:17:18,584
What's happening here?

1500
02:17:19,708 --> 02:17:21,912
Those guys are kidding us
out there!

1501
02:17:33,660 --> 02:17:36,693
Know what?
Try one and one... it's eleven

1502
02:17:51,196 --> 02:17:52,984
Explosion, brother!

1503
02:17:54,012 --> 02:17:55,223
Shiva!

1504
02:18:02,108 --> 02:18:05,785
Remember what Mother used to say?
When nothing else works...

1505
02:18:06,108 --> 02:18:09,720
a prayer yields fruit.
So let's pray

1506
02:18:13,628 --> 02:18:16,049
God's gift!

1507
02:18:17,180 --> 02:18:22,101
We played football with it, remember?
- Let's play catching the ball

1508
02:18:23,772 --> 02:18:28,824
lf you remember, when we gave it
a hard kick, it simply blew up

1509
02:18:30,108 --> 02:18:32,017
ls it the same one...? You take it!
- You take!

1510
02:18:32,892 --> 02:18:35,543
Toss it out... Go on!

1511
02:18:41,308 --> 02:18:44,821
Let's try some more noises?
- What noises?

1512
02:18:45,148 --> 02:18:48,018
Press these buttons,
something will give way

1513
02:19:04,444 --> 02:19:06,267
Something blew up out there!

1514
02:19:11,933 --> 02:19:14,322
Kasim, l'm not in the car...

1515
02:19:41,788 --> 02:19:44,920
You said you couldn't
even ride a bicycle

1516
02:19:45,244 --> 02:19:47,131
So how're you driving a tank?

1517
02:19:47,356 --> 02:19:51,927
A bicycle needs to be balanced...
this is balanced on its own

1518
02:19:52,348 --> 02:19:54,323
l don't get this. Can you explain?

1519
02:19:59,452 --> 02:20:02,387
Our bag of tricks...

1520
02:20:02,813 --> 02:20:05,780
the world will see

1521
02:20:06,492 --> 02:20:09,624
We're different...

1522
02:20:09,948 --> 02:20:12,631
there's no one
quite like us

1523
02:20:12,956 --> 02:20:16,022
There hasn't been anyone like us...

1524
02:20:16,348 --> 02:20:19,861
nor will there ever be...

1525
02:20:21,916 --> 02:20:24,021
buddy-boy

1526
02:20:24,893 --> 02:20:27,446
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten and one...

1527
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:38,231
one and one makes eleven...

1528
02:20:38,556 --> 02:20:40,978
buddy-boy

1529
02:20:49,948 --> 02:20:52,818
You don't even know...

1530
02:20:53,404 --> 02:20:55,291
your death is soon arriving

1531
02:20:55,613 --> 02:20:56,595
Stop!

1532
02:20:56,925 --> 02:20:59,794
The impossible
is about to happen...

1533
02:21:00,284 --> 02:21:03,034
so start counting
your days

1534
02:21:03,388 --> 02:21:06,171
One, two, three, four...
- Five, six, seven, eight...

1535
02:21:06,748 --> 02:21:09,137
ten and eleven...

1536
02:21:21,404 --> 02:21:25,048
Where have they gone? And who did
this all this? Mr Ram Singh?

1537
02:21:27,196 --> 02:21:28,984
There's Cobra!

1538
02:21:31,228 --> 02:21:32,635
Here you are.
- You use it

1539
02:21:32,956 --> 02:21:34,865
l have a bad aim. You shoot at him.
- l can't shoot at all

1540
02:21:35,196 --> 02:21:37,105
Let's try together.
- Suits me

1541
02:21:39,773 --> 02:21:42,107
We hit his leg again!

1542
02:21:43,164 --> 02:21:45,302
You shoot me in the leg again!
Brother...

1543
02:21:45,692 --> 02:21:48,507
Die, you swine! How long
am l going to carry you?

1544
02:21:51,196 --> 02:21:53,585
No one can tie Panther down

1545
02:21:56,828 --> 02:21:59,828
l'm not sparing you!
- Panther's running away

1546
02:22:34,524 --> 02:22:37,786
Like the other day,
won't you wager a bet today?

1547
02:22:38,428 --> 02:22:40,338
No more blows?

1548
02:22:41,500 --> 02:22:44,402
Today... you get only one blow

1549
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:47,067
One? For Panther?

1550
02:23:11,068 --> 02:23:15,575
What is the story of Tara and Sitara?
Can you explain it?

1551
02:23:16,700 --> 02:23:21,304
You know l can't explain.
Still, l will try

1552
02:23:22,493 --> 02:23:27,064
Although Tara and Sitara
stay in darkness...

1553
02:23:27,388 --> 02:23:32,473
they give light to the whole world.
- My word!

1554
02:23:32,892 --> 02:23:36,340
For the first time, you've
explained it without any hiccups!

1555
02:23:36,988 --> 02:23:40,818
Also for the first time,
we have done something good

1556
02:23:41,308 --> 02:23:46,261
But there's something
piercing my heart

1557
02:23:46,588 --> 02:23:49,622
What?
- Ram Singh's family...

1558
02:23:49,980 --> 02:23:52,347
made no attempt to stop us!

1559
02:23:58,236 --> 02:24:00,789
You're leaving without telling me?
- As if you'd have stopped us

1560
02:24:01,116 --> 02:24:03,025
l could've dropped you
at the station in my jeep

1561
02:24:03,292 --> 02:24:06,423
We don't need any jeep.
- We can walk also

1562
02:24:06,748 --> 02:24:08,658
He's offering us a lift!

1563
02:24:08,988 --> 02:24:10,962
l've arranged a mare for you

1564
02:24:44,060 --> 02:24:46,743
For the first time ever
Tara and Sitara realised...

1565
02:24:47,068 --> 02:24:49,938
that good company could
reform the worst of them

1566
02:24:50,652 --> 02:24:54,809
When the power of one and one
helped humanity and the nation...

1567
02:24:55,132 --> 02:24:58,962
they had found their wives,
a family and a comfortable life

1568
02:25:00,028 --> 02:25:07,546
But old habits die hard.
They wouldn't guarantee otherwise
