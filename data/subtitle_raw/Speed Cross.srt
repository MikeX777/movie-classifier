1
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:39,083
<i>Hello, Paolo? It's Nicola.</i>

2
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:42,333
<i>- Who?
- Nicola Cellammare.</i>

3
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,416
<i>Nicola! Where are you?</i>

4
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,625
<i>I'm in America. I'll finish my race
and come back to Europe.</i>

5
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:53,250
<i>- Really?
- I have a race in Germany, in Neuerburg.</i>

6
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:57,416
<i>I'm going to Neuerburg too!
Let's meet and go together.</i>

7
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,250
<i>Sure! Where will we meet?</i>

8
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:03,375
<i>- Is the Punterito crossroad okay?
- Perfect.</i>

9
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:07,083
<i>- See you there in three days.
- Very well! Bye.</i>

10
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,916
Paolo! I'm here!

11
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,208
- What can I do for you?
- Have you gone crazy?

12
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:23,375
You're two hours late,
and you pretend you don't know me?

13
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,291
What is it?

14
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,375
Nicola!

15
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:34,625
- It's you! How are you?
- I get by.

16
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:39,333
- Everything okay? Problems on the trip?
- No. I'm coming from Genoa.

17
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,250
You came from Genoa?
What road did you take?

18
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:47,875
I don't have a license plate or
headlights, so I came through the fields.

19
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,041
- America didn't change you.
- It tried.

20
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:56,375
- Must we talk on the street?
- Right! Load up your motorbike.

21
00:03:56,458 --> 00:04:01,250
- Wait. Let's eat something first.
- We'll eat on the way.

22
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:05,666
I'm freezing.
This is a very unwelcoming place.

23
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,416
Nicola, must we talk on the street?

24
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,583
Okay! Come on. Help me.

25
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:16,166
- How did it go in America?
- The United States! Wow!

26
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,291
Come here. It's a strange country.
You have to pay taxes!

27
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,125
Or you have to leave the country.
That's it. Go on.

28
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,291
What women did to me... What is it?

29
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,333
Take care of the motorcycle.
You'll tell me later.

30
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,250
Paolo. Paolo!

31
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,041
Give me a hand!

32
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,791
Alright, fine.

33
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,583
What did you do in America
these last four years?

34
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:46,875
What did I do? I raced.
I raced again. I always raced.

35
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:52,416
The last race never ended.
24 hours, always racing.

36
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,250
- Those Americans!
- My head spun like a top!

37
00:04:56,333 --> 00:05:00,000
<i>- So it was tough?
- Yes, but I made it.</i>

38
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:04,375
- You won?
- Yes, but it all went to pay taxes.

39
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,791
<i>- They even took my trophy.
- And you?</i>

40
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:14,958
<i>There were two women on
the podium with such long legs!</i>

41
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,708
<i>- You found comfort looking at them?
- Yes.</i>

42
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,875
<i>Yes, just looking!</i>

43
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,750
- What did you do?
- The usual.

44
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:29,000
<i>I participated in some local races
and kept training.</i>

45
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,375
You call that training?
In and out of a garage?

46
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,458
I even trained on the street.

47
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,333
{\an8}TRAFFIC POLICE

48
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,333
{\an8}- Who is that madman?
- A real lunatic.

49
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,333
- He's a jerk!
- No. He's just crazy.

50
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,041
Wow! What a flight!

51
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,500
When I stopped,
they had such faces on them!

52
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,750
Here I am, ready to pay.

53
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,083
Go ahead and laugh! Now we'll laugh.

54
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,333
No weapons. I was just kidding.

55
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,666
Driver's license and registration.

56
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,583
Were you frightened?

57
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,791
No headlight, no plate.
You're in trouble. Give me your license.

58
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,666
- This jerk is a colleague!
- Oh, that too!

59
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:01,416
- It's Corti, the motocross guy.
- Yes.

60
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,833
Instead of bothering us,
train properly so you'll win on Sunday.

61
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,250
- That's what I'm doing.
- Yes. Go away.

62
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,375
- What are you drinking?
- You want some?

63
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:15,875
- No, thanks. You drink?
- A drop, once in a while.

64
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:20,791
- I decided to leave the police.
- Are you kidding?

65
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:25,708
- You left it four years ago.
- I was born to be a racer.

66
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:29,416
- I wasn't? Darn it!
- What is it?

67
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,208
Something is wrong. The water light is on.

68
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,083
I see.

69
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,208
The fan belt broke.

70
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,875
We need an automotive parts store.

71
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:01,791
I'll go by motorbike.
I don't know if you'd be able to make it.

72
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:06,500
Let's go together. I'll show you I can.

73
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:19,291
- How can you get past there?
- Go. You teach me.

74
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,291
Look at him!

75
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,541
Stop! Slowly! Slowly!

76
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,125
It's hot today, huh?

77
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,041
- Can you give me a belt like this?
- Yes.

78
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,500
Nicola, a little sip
to stimulate your reflexes?

79
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:38,041
"Welcome to Neuerburg." And here we are.

80
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,875
- I saw a beautiful girl!
- There are many beautiful girls here.

81
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,791
- Don't start now.
- You don't start!

82
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,250
- My gosh!
- What?

83
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,875
This place is ancient, it's beautiful.

84
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,083
Did you see the architecture?
Better than America!

85
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,375
What a beautiful cathedral!

86
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,458
This city will go down in history,
thanks to the two of us.

87
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,166
You don't believe me?

88
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,916
Stop, Paolo! Stop!

89
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,666
- What is it?
- Wait. I'll show you.

90
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,500
Good morning.

91
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,208
- My God!
- Good morning.

92
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,500
Me Tarzan. You Jane?

93
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,875
No, huh? You're not Jane?

94
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,958
Not Jane. I'm Inge.

95
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,541
What do I do now?

96
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:04,625
I don't know what you do here
when a boy likes a girl,

97
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,666
but I know how it's done where I'm from.

98
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,708
- Excuse me.
- Wait, I must talk to her.

99
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:14,708
The boy says to the girl,
"Hi. How are you? You're cute."

100
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,458
- "What are you doing tonight?"
- She has to pump my tires.

101
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:23,416
Be quiet a minute. I was saying...
There are two possibilities.

102
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,333
I suggest you choose the second.

103
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:31,750
If the guy is unpleasant,
she says, "Mind your own business."

104
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:35,000
- I choose the first.
- No. There's the second possibility.

105
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,416
- She's nice and will go for it.
- You know, you're right.

106
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,291
Why are you getting into this? Go away!

107
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,208
No. This is an interesting conversation.

108
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,833
- Do you need gas?
- What?

109
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,791
Do you want to fill it up?

110
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:54,916
Yes. It depends on the light.
Sometimes it's red, sometimes not.

111
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,625
Come see. This is it.
At times it's red, at times it isn't.

112
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,416
No, no. This one...

113
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,458
Paolo? Darn it!

114
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,708
Will you stop it?

115
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:18,958
Nicola, we have gas. Everything is okay.

116
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:22,125
- Yes, everything is okay.
- Get inside!

117
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,208
Hi! I'll call you, huh?

118
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:31,250
- See what I did?
- Yes. Good work.

119
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,500
Learn!

120
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,708
I'm coming!

121
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,416
Paolo!

122
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,958
Come on. Let's hurry. A nice shower...

123
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,000
Let's go! Calm down. You never stop!

124
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,750
- I'll find you some, too.
- I'll take care of it.

125
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,291
I'm going out with Inge tonight.
I don't want to leave you alone.

126
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,625
You know what I'll do? Hello!

127
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,833
- I'll ask Inge if she has a friend.
- What do the gentlemen want?

128
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:15,083
- Two singles with bathrooms.
- Did you see the technique?

129
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:19,375
- American style. See?
- Two with a shower. IDs.

130
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,458
IDs.

131
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:28,000
My God! Paolo...
I'm going to the coffee shop.

132
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,791
I'm going to the coffee shop.

133
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,875
- Fill this up.
- Your reflex medicine!

134
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,416
- What would you like?
- Grappa.

135
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,083
Excuse me. Are you
from the International Federation?

136
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:02,541
- Yes. Federal inspector.
- Are you here for the race?

137
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,583
- Yes.
- So am I.

138
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,833
Sorry. Sometimes I forget my good manners.

139
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,833
- Nicola.
- I'm Muller. Are you a participant?

140
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,333
- Yes. One of the best.
- Is my canteen ready?

141
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:18,750
Paolo is a participant too.
Mr. Muller, from the Federation.

142
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,791
- Very pleased to meet you.
- A federal inspector!

143
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:25,458
I'm Paolo Corti.
We are private participants.

144
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:29,875
- We don't have a sponsor yet.
- A big problem!

145
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:34,750
- We must do everything ourselves.
- You are brave.

146
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,416
- Are there many participants?
- Yes, many.

147
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,541
Not bad, huh?

148
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,833
- She's cute.
- She's cute.

149
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:50,416
Yes, but I think she sells love
at variable prices.

150
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,833
I noticed that too.

151
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:57,791
- My friend loves all of them.
- It's not true!

152
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,208
Damn them! When will they stop?

153
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,625
Gentlemen...

154
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,500
Good evening, everyone.

155
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,333
Have you seen this?

156
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:41,083
"The Mafia that lord over our area
have got their hands on sports, too."

157
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:45,166
"The world of racing is another one
of their dirty businesses."

158
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,083
"In order to keep us docile, they use
the rod and carrot system."

159
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:55,125
"But these systems don't work on us."

160
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:59,166
"The races are a big business
for only a few."

161
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,250
"Here, to see fanatics kill one another,
you must pay."

162
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,875
And a lot, too.

163
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,750
A very interesting article,
you must agree.

164
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:15,541
- Who wrote it?
- It's mine.

165
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:20,750
I spiced it up a little,
to increase interest in the races.

166
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:24,416
Very good! You deserve a drink.

167
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,000
No, thanks. Next time.

168
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,666
Oh, no. Now.
Accept, or we'll take offense.

169
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,291
Give it to me.

170
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,375
Here you go. Drink!

171
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:59,583
- Stop it!
- You must oil your brain.

172
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,791
- Stop!
- You write bullshit. You're rusty.

173
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,750
Come on!

174
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:09,541
Must I take offense? I told you to drink!

175
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:13,125
Drink... drink.

176
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,375
Excuse me, but...
what if he doesn't want to?

177
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,916
The joke has lasted long enough.

178
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,333
My friend is right.

179
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,250
What is going on?

180
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,666
What are you doing?

181
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,708
Are you crazy?

182
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,333
Make love, not war.

183
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:19,083
Yes, maybe you're right.
The lesson was enough.

184
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,875
See? He's a good guy.

185
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,791
After all.

186
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:28,541
You two mind your own business
next time, okay?

187
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,833
Yes, we got it. Isn't that right?

188
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,291
Clear.

189
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,833
If you want to go on being a journalist,

190
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,291
I suggest you change pens.
Yours writes bullshit!

191
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,708
Let your elders teach you the job.

192
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,791
What is your article
for tomorrow, Fischer?

193
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:57,208
I'll snipe at Town Hall.
It doesn't provide toilets for dogs.

194
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,916
You're right.
It's time to stop with this disgrace.

195
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,208
It's a serious problem.

196
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,250
Let's go.

197
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,541
Bye, beautiful.

198
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,958
- Thanks. Can I offer you something?
- No, thank you.

199
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,625
I never refuse a glass. A double one.

200
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,166
- Bourbon, right?
- Yes.

201
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,458
Break a leg, boys.

202
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,958
Your drink, sir.

203
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:58,333
Hey, guys! Let's go somewhere
that's made for love.

204
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,416
No?

205
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:08,166
That's for the best. It could be bad
for you. Can you believe that?

206
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,500
- You don't want anything else?
- No, we are tired from the trip.

207
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,750
Some other time. Let's go.

208
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,458
Consider it accepted, okay?

209
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,958
Go ahead and laugh!
There's not much to laugh about.

210
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:28,625
The situation is terrible here.
They say "women are objects".

211
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,666
Women are objects?
Nobody will buy this object here.

212
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,416
Not even rent it.

213
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,625
Don't write bad things about your host,
or have others solve your issues.

214
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,083
See how many problems you've caused?

215
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,083
Now I'll teach you how to live.

216
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,375
Nicola! Quick.
They are beating up the journalist!

217
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,791
Stop! Come on, let's go.

218
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:20,583
Get up. They beat you up good.

219
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:24,750
They really are upset with you.
What do they want?

220
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,791
Nothing. Leave me alone!

221
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,458
What a nice place!

222
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:37,375
Instead of racing,
we've come to this town to fight.

223
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:53,250
Hello? Excuse me, miss.
I need a phone number.

224
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:58,375
The girl who works
at the gas station outside. You have it?

225
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:03,125
Thanks a million.
She gave it to me, but I lost it.

226
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:08,416
Thank you. Can you give it to me?
Let me talk to her.

227
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:10,833
Thank you.

228
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:14,958
Hello? Who is it?

229
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:18,666
Who am I? How can I explain?

230
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:20,583
Yes. Or course!

231
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:25,750
Me Tarzan. You Jane. Do you remember me?

232
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:29,083
Yes, sure. I remember.

233
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:32,416
You've no qualms in calling.
Do you need anything?

234
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,041
Nothing,
I just have a little plan to propose.

235
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,333
Dinner wherever you choose.

236
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:43,875
Dancing in a place you choose, and then...

237
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,500
Then... we could end
the evening somewhere.

238
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:52,125
- I choose the place this time. Okay?
- No.

239
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:54,583
- You said yes?
- Sorry, no.

240
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:59,750
- Did you get offended?
- No, I'm glad to hear from Tarzan.

241
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,958
- But Jane is already in bed.
- Okay.

242
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:08,166
Goodbye now. Say hi to your friend for me.

243
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,166
Bye.

244
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,625
It won't end here.

245
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:29,708
Why don't you say hello
to his friend right away?

246
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,333
Why not?

247
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:46,791
This time, Eric, I prefer to bet
everything on just one racer.

248
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,500
Take it over there.

249
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:58,333
- You can also bet on the test races.
- I prefer betting on the real race.

250
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,291
- Welcome back, Countess.
- Thank you.

251
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:06,166
Hello, Mayer.
This year, there are some strong racers.

252
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,291
Thank you.

253
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:16,583
The best time on 18 as a winner.

254
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:33,833
Twelve.

255
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,958
Are you crazy?

256
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:52,583
- I was kidding.
- Take this!

257
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Paolo, look at them. Are they crazy?

258
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:04,541
Nobody is separating them?

259
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:13,875
Don't get involved.
I've had enough of being a policeman.

260
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,708
- Who will win?
- Get the bike. Let's go test them.

261
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:22,416
Actually, today...

262
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,916
I want to see what you do
to get an idea. You mind?

263
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,083
Are you scared of me?
Come on. They are only test runs.

264
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,625
- I know.
- Come on, get busy!

265
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:34,625
Okay.

266
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:38,916
Whoever bet on 22 was right.

267
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,208
We can try too, dear.

268
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,625
Bet on something, too.

269
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:48,916
Waiter?

270
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,291
Bet it on 18.

271
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,416
- See how he speeds?
- Wait.

272
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:10,458
Better take it easy on initial laps.
Let's study the racetrack first.

273
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:11,916
Okay. Holy smokes!

274
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:24,041
If he keeps goosing the engine,
it'll break.

275
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:28,166
Those people go fast.
It'll be hard to get qualified.

276
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,083
Paolo, are you scared of someone
with a broken exhaust pipe?

277
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:36,291
His exhaust pipe isn't broken!
He's speeding!

278
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:40,916
When I was in the United States...

279
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,208
When I was there, a guy did it
on purpose to make more noise.

280
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:48,666
It sounded like he was speeding.
He's doing the same thing.

281
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,208
- His time will be terrible.
- I don't give a darn!

282
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:09,250
- Mr. Mayer?
- Yes?

283
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,583
- Kurt is on the phone.
- Excuse me a minute.

284
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,250
Mayer.

285
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,083
How are the bets going?

286
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:34,333
Kurt, do you have the final balance
of the other bookmakers?

287
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:37,791
Is there anything else?

288
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:42,500
I think Muller, the Federation guy,
is looking for trouble.

289
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:46,500
He'll be at the racetrack
in a few minutes. Any orders?

290
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:50,750
- No, but tell me when he arrives.
- Alright.

291
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,875
Are you racing, too?

292
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:23,791
Muller is here.

293
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,125
Wow! You got an excellent time!

294
00:29:57,958 --> 00:30:02,250
- You didn't even speed that much!
- I just tried the racetrack.

295
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:08,708
The bumps are the same,
but the curves throw you out.

296
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:12,500
Especially the one after the small valley.

297
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:17,416
You must widen up high when turning,
downshift two gears and give gas.

298
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Two gears?
If I downshift three, are you happy?

299
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:24,541
- I saw. I start with an advantage.
- Nicola, go try it out.

300
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:25,708
I'm going!

301
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:35,541
Tell camera three to center Muller.

302
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,416
Camera three, center Muller.

303
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:54,166
Put him on the big screen.

304
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,916
Eighty-five.

305
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,375
How did I do?

306
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,833
Better than me, you did two tenths less.

307
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:06,416
I speed like a rocket. When you
want to race with me, let me know.

308
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:11,541
- When I was in the United States...
- Okay, I already said it.

309
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,666
I'll go practice.

310
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:55,666
The wolf came out of its den.

311
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:01,083
How many will you kill on Sunday?

312
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:04,750
How many guys
did you find ready to be killed

313
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:07,833
to please your respectable clients?

314
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:12,083
You left the races
because you were afraid,

315
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:15,833
and you hid amongst
the paperwork of the Federation.

316
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:20,916
Don't bother those
who still have the courage to race.

317
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:25,125
Go away, Muller.
Your presence is not needed here.

318
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:28,791
You know I didn't quit
because I was afraid.

319
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,041
It's not about that.

320
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:36,291
You are done, Mayer.
Your races are just massacres!

321
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:39,458
I have evidence of your activity.

322
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:43,625
Here, there's everything
your men do during the races,

323
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:46,125
and your circle of bets.

324
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:48,500
I'll throw it in your face before Sunday!

325
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:53,875
You'll never hold another race again.
You have Walter Muller's word!

326
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:03,791
You were right,
Muller is really looking for trouble.

327
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,041
Take care of it.

328
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,708
- Fill it up, please.
- Yes.

329
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,708
- Fifty marks, please.
- There you go.

330
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:47,000
- I'll bring you the change.
- Okay.

331
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,625
- Here.
- Thanks.

332
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,041
There's nothing here.

333
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:32,875
Come out, Muller! We have to talk to you!

334
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:39,250
Muller!

335
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,125
Why did you shoot?

336
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,291
He was reaching for a gun!

337
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,416
Damn! He just has this.

338
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:28,500
Idiot! Get rid of him.

339
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:34,041
You came here because you like the races?

340
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:37,208
- No. I like the racers.
- I see!

341
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:42,583
- We're racers.
- I know, that's why I'm here.

342
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:45,541
Would you do me a favor?

343
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:49,500
- Just to you?
- No. I'm fine as it is.

344
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:54,333
I'm waiting for the girl who works
at the gas station, she's coming.

345
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:57,333
I spoke for him, he's a bit shy.

346
00:40:57,416 --> 00:41:01,125
He's right, I'm shy. Very shy.

347
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:05,583
He, instead, is very good,
but not with women, with motorbikes.

348
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:07,083
Good for you.

349
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:11,875
You'll see her coming in a bit.
She has a date with me.

350
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:16,166
- I don't believe it.
- Okay. You'll see in a bit.

351
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,458
- I'll leave you alone.
- He's crazy!

352
00:41:21,416 --> 00:41:23,666
I'll make a pass at you now, okay?

353
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:27,333
- As a joke. I'm already in love.
- Sure.

354
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:31,000
How should I make a pass?
Some put their hands on you.

355
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:33,291
Yes, very efficient.

356
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,375
Excuse me a moment.

357
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:48,750
A friend is here. Excuse me.

358
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:04,208
Inge!

359
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:05,958
Stop!

360
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:11,125
You're making me run a lot.

361
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,166
If I'd known, I'd have taken the bike!

362
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:16,875
What happened?

363
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:22,458
Something happened
at the gas station. No more gas?

364
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:25,750
- No. That's not it.
- What happened?

365
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:31,708
I'm not used to finding a guy
who invited me to dinner with a...

366
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:36,083
- I don't know how to say it.
- Whore!

367
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:38,625
I mean... she's called a whore!

368
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:42,625
It was a joke. Paolo was making fun of me.

369
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:45,750
Understand? Will you stop? Please.

370
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:49,166
Stop! Come on. Smile!

371
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:56,750
Peace?

372
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,458
Paolo, open up. I must tell you something.

373
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:11,666
- What is it?
- It's very important.

374
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,291
Go away. I have things to do.

375
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:18,500
It'll only take a moment.
I went out with Inge.

376
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:22,750
- You went to bed with her?
- No, much more.

377
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:26,166
- Something more important.
- I'll be quick.

378
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:30,333
- Are you with a woman?
- Inge, the first day...

379
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:32,666
- Is there a woman here?
- Yes.

380
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,833
- I wanted to tell you...
- We'll talk later.

381
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:38,291
- When we arrived...
- Tomorrow.

382
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:39,541
What is it?

383
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:42,958
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

384
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:55,208
I don't understand women!

385
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:30,000
Paolo, I see strange movements here.

386
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:33,333
Something's up.

387
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:36,708
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Resi.

388
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:40,708
Hi. What always happens happened.

389
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:46,791
Mayer told someone that
the real jackpot is 50,000 dollars,

390
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:50,041
not 5,000 as it was initially.

391
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:53,500
Why? You didn't know?

392
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,791
No, not really.

393
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,416
We always thought
it was 5,000 dollars, not 50,000.

394
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,083
Man, 50,000 dollars!

395
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:09,583
- What does he want in exchange?
- Your life.

396
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,791
Mayer wants your life.

397
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:19,625
Leave, while you still can.

398
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:24,000
This is not just speed cross.
It has nothing to do with sport.

399
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:27,666
Last year, three boys died.
They were all 20 years old.

400
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:32,916
- Swept away on the first lap.
- Mayer has decided who wins.

401
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,875
If someone blocks him
and ruins the bets, he's done for.

402
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,750
50,000 dollars to race against
other people's lives. That's the price.

403
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:50,500
Isn't there a little bit of fanciful
exaggeration going on here?

404
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:53,791
- I wish!
- I mean...

405
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:58,500
Cross races are tough, maybe this one
is tougher than the others.

406
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:04,125
In America, speed cross races are
clandestine. In Nevada, Mexico.

407
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:10,500
But almost nothing happens, nobody dies.

408
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:14,416
There can be some accidents,
but they're just accidents.

409
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:20,875
Listen. What do you say if we relax
before the final tests?

410
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:23,791
Big champions do it, too.

411
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:28,833
Thanks, but it isn't the right moment.
You don't mind, huh?

412
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:34,958
Resi is a good girl. You don't mind,
do you? Let's go test them.

413
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:09,375
We are betting 15 and 85 at one
and a half. They're the favourites..

414
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:11,541
Okay, go. Thanks.

415
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:15,916
Mayer?

416
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,916
Congratulations, there are
some very brave boys this year.

417
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,958
Right.

418
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,750
Are you ready? Set a good time.

419
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:40,000
Kurt, one of the two Italians is
getting good times. The other one?

420
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:43,333
He's at the pit boxes getting times.

421
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:52,625
Wow, Paolo! You are awesome!

422
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:54,458
- Are you Nicola?
- He's good, huh?

423
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:58,375
Someone wants you on the phone.
A girl called Inge.

424
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,000
- Who?
- Inge!

425
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:02,916
Thanks!

426
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,458
Hello Inge? Hi, love. How are you?

427
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:14,666
Please, speak louder. I can't hear you.
I can't hear anything!

428
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,791
I'm speaking out loud! Hear me?

429
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:18,875
Yes.

430
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:24,916
Paolo and I will qualify for sure.
We are doing great!

431
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,541
- I love you! And you?
- Yes. I think so, Nicola.

432
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:31,666
Hurry up. Come now!

433
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,500
No. I can't right now.

434
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:39,250
I have to do a couple of laps,
then I'll come. Do you love me?

435
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,833
- Yes!
- Say it again!

436
00:48:41,916 --> 00:48:43,375
Yes!

437
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:47,666
Bye, baby! Bye! I have to run. Bye!

438
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:06,958
Paolo! You know who was on the phone?

439
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:10,875
I don't care. Go qualify.
You got a shitty time.

440
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:13,750
Yes, you're right. Guess who it was? Inge.

441
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:16,041
Who?

442
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:17,875
Inge!

443
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:22,416
- What did she say?
- My gosh!

444
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,916
She loves me.

445
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:28,458
- This is a love story.
- Take my time.

446
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:30,416
Yes, okay.

447
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:35,166
Watch out for the third curve up there.
Use second gear or...

448
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:55,500
Did Muller stop at the gas station?
He could've left his documents there.

449
00:49:55,583 --> 00:50:00,166
- I told you you as soon as I remembered.
- Those documents are important.

450
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:04,750
They must be there.
We must get them. Take care of it!

451
00:50:05,791 --> 00:50:08,833
- Without revealing yourselves.
- Okay.

452
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:12,541
The gas station girl talked
on the phone with the Italian guy.

453
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:14,583
I don't think it was about documents.

454
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:20,208
Mayer, the two Italians are getting
good times. We must do something.

455
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:25,250
You're right, they're too fast.
They could mess up the bets.

456
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:31,458
It won't be a problem.
You've fixed up tougher guys during races.

457
00:50:31,541 --> 00:50:34,458
Now, let's get those documents back.

458
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:36,208
Be careful.

459
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:12,541
Weird, Kurt and Ramirez are leaving
without the first position time.

460
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:19,166
It might be a racing tactic,
but I don't like it.

461
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:22,125
What do we care?

462
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:37,000
- Hello, we need some information.
- Sure.

463
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:41,583
The other day, a gentleman
got gas here, Mr. Muller.

464
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:46,416
- He left an envelope for me.
- Yes, I remember Mr. Muller.

465
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,166
- But he didn't leave any envelope.
- Think about it.

466
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:54,416
It was an envelope like this.
I'm sure he left it here.

467
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,291
Listen. It's closing time.

468
00:51:59,041 --> 00:51:59,958
I said...

469
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:03,458
Fischer, on the phone!

470
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:07,041
Fischer, you're wanted on the phone. Come!

471
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:10,208
Here on the right. Just as you turn.

472
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:17,791
Fischer.

473
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:19,791
What?

474
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:26,916
I see.

475
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:28,625
Thanks.

476
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:37,208
- Did you try S-5?
- S-5? Sure.

477
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,291
The gas station girl.

478
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:45,500
She just got robbed.

479
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:48,625
- When?
- Just now.

480
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,541
Go.

481
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:29,500
Yes? Yes, she's dead.

482
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:31,875
No, nobody noticed anything.

483
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,000
It looks like a robbery.

484
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:37,375
She has an injury on her head,
as though she banged it.

485
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:39,875
Sure, I'll wait for you.

486
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:44,625
Come on, let's go.

487
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:56,083
I can't wait to leave
this disgusting place.

488
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,666
Nicola, hurry up.

489
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:00,750
Why should we leave?

490
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:07,166
Nicola, I don't like this place.
Strange things happen.

491
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:11,875
Threatened journalists,
Muller vanishes into thin air...

492
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,000
And then Inge. No.

493
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:20,083
I'm convinced it wasn't a robbery.
Something's up here.

494
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:26,250
Nobody would rob
a gas station at that hour.

495
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:29,833
You realize that? It's too risky.

496
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:34,250
Besides...

497
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,791
At that time of day,
they haven't made much money.

498
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:42,791
They do most of the work in the afternoon.

499
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:46,958
In the morning, everyone
is at the racetrack for the tests.

500
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:49,916
The sooner we leave, the better.

501
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,291
Nicola, these people
are willing to do anything.

502
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:56,750
If someone doesn't play their game,
they get rid of him.

503
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:07,208
Maybe these are just
the stupid thoughts of a policeman.

504
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:09,250
Anyway, we're leaving this place.

505
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:11,708
I'm not coming.

506
00:55:12,291 --> 00:55:14,125
What did you say?

507
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:15,958
You heard me.

508
00:55:18,708 --> 00:55:23,166
- I'm not leaving.
- Is this race so important?

509
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,958
It's not about the race,

510
00:55:25,541 --> 00:55:29,000
even if I could use those 50,000 dollars
to go back to America.

511
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:36,833
There are doubts about Inge's death,
you said that.

512
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:39,250
Yes. Listen.

513
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:45,375
Nicola, we are just racers,
and we only know how to race.

514
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:47,166
Not how to be policeman!

515
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,500
Yes, I know what you're saying.

516
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,416
Races, fame.

517
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:57,250
- Millions.
- Does that disgust you?

518
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:58,791
No!

519
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:05,500
So, what do you want to do?

520
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,083
I don't know.

521
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:12,750
I want to know how Inge died.

522
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,166
I must know. Understand?

523
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:21,375
Inge meant something to me, Paolo.

524
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:27,500
We loved each other, Paolo.

525
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:32,750
I can't leave
without knowing who killed her.

526
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:45,000
I don't want to disappoint you, but...

527
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:52,166
She doesn't deserve
the respect you give her.

528
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:07,916
I don't understand. What did you say?

529
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:11,125
Paolo.

530
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:14,333
What do you mean?

531
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,041
I wanted to say that...

532
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,458
The first day we arrived,
Inge slept with me.

533
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:39,208
Aren't you ashamed?

534
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:41,333
Jerk!

535
00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:49,583
She's dead, jerk!

536
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,125
I just wanted...

537
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:06,458
It's not true.
I just wanted you to come away.

538
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:04,833
I told you to be careful!
It was a pointless murder.

539
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:07,375
We needed that girl alive!

540
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:13,666
Who will tell us where the documents are?

541
00:59:30,916 --> 00:59:35,000
Kurt, you've been making stupid mistakes
this whole time.

542
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:37,458
Now, we must fix things.

543
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:43,208
Hello?

544
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:48,083
- Who knows that you're here?
- My men.

545
00:59:48,166 --> 00:59:53,125
I put a couple on the Italians,
maybe they know something.

546
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:56,166
Yes, it's Kurt.

547
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:05,000
One of the two left.
The one who was with Inge stayed in town.

548
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:06,333
Strange, huh?

549
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:13,000
We must keep an eye on them.
Threaten them if it's necessary.

550
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:16,125
But you must not kill them. Is that clear?

551
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:20,500
Okay, don't lose sight of them.

552
01:00:21,791 --> 01:00:25,166
I hope we didn't underestimate those two.

553
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,375
Maybe they even know
where the documents are.

554
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,541
Hurry up.

555
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,833
- Who is it?
- The waiter.

556
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:14,166
- What do you want?
- Hold still!

557
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:22,833
Okay, guys, let him go.
He knows he'd better behave.

558
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:27,250
- What do you want?
- We just want to talk.

559
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:30,125
I hope you don't mind.

560
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:34,125
What were you doing
at the gas station?

561
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,916
Looking for something?

562
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:38,583
I'll tell you.

563
01:02:38,666 --> 01:02:41,791
You were looking for an envelope
with documents in it.

564
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:48,750
- So what if I was?
- You want to end up like Inge?

565
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:17,500
Buddy, pull over. We need to talk to you!

566
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:49,625
Let's see if you're still interested
in what isn't your business.

567
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:53,541
If you have half a brain, leave!
Forget this town.

568
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,708
Drag him out.

569
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:26,791
Down!

570
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:47,000
That's one dealt with.

571
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:15,416
Hey, careful!

572
01:05:33,541 --> 01:05:34,541
Nicola!

573
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:46,916
Nicola! What happened?

574
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:49,458
Who did it?

575
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:56,708
It doesn't seem serious at first glance.

576
01:05:56,791 --> 01:06:00,208
Anyway, I'll wait to see the x-rays.

577
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:02,916
Then I'll be able to be more precise.

578
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,416
- Doctor, the x-rays.
- Thank you.

579
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,833
We'll know more with these,

580
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:11,666
and I can give you a diagnosis.

581
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:15,833
- Doctor, you're wanted on the phone.
- I'll be right there. Excuse me.

582
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:17,500
Please.

583
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:25,125
Hello? What?
Yes, number 12. I remember.

584
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:28,708
He has a broken femur.
That's normal, he had surgery.

585
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:29,791
Yes.

586
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:34,041
What did you give him?
It's what's best, right?

587
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:37,083
You can give him everything.

588
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:42,625
What? No, I wouldn't suggest
traction, at least not right now.

589
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:47,083
Yes, you can dismiss him.
He must return in 20 days.

590
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:49,041
Shoulder, femur...

591
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:51,291
We'll see what's to be done.

592
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53,125
And tibia. There.

593
01:06:58,708 --> 01:07:00,333
What did you give him?

594
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:02,541
Fine.

595
01:07:04,166 --> 01:07:06,000
Alright.

596
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:17,291
I'm sorry, it's a continuous
back and forth in the hospital.

597
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:20,375
We need patience. Let's see.

598
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:24,666
What an ugly fracture!
A really ugly fracture, look.

599
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:28,583
That's a total horizontal break.
It must heal.

600
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:31,750
He will need a cast,
and hopefully the bone will heal.

601
01:07:31,833 --> 01:07:34,541
- Will it be painful?
- Somewhat.

602
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:37,625
We'll try to make it
as painless as possible.

603
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:42,291
- Must he remain immobile?
- Absolutely.

604
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:45,833
- For a long time?
- Yes, unfortunately.

605
01:07:55,916 --> 01:07:59,875
But you... hadn't you left?

606
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:03,000
Good thing I came back.

607
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:06,625
As soon as I leave you a for minute,
look what happens.

608
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:09,833
Nicola...

609
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:14,250
Do you feel like telling me how it went?

610
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:18,875
What's wrong with me?

611
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:24,500
Nothing. Just a broken leg, don't worry.

612
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,375
Kurt and the other two assaulted me.

613
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:31,458
They wanted some documents

614
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:35,375
that they think were at the gas station.

615
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,291
Documents? About what?

616
01:08:37,875 --> 01:08:40,625
I don't know, they didn't tell me.

617
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:43,208
They...

618
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:47,208
They beat me up.

619
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:49,625
Then they threw me down the stairs.

620
01:08:50,791 --> 01:08:53,000
They wanted to scare me.

621
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:56,833
"Go away", they said. Then...

622
01:08:57,458 --> 01:09:02,500
They made me drink a bottle of whiskey.

623
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:04,333
I don't know why.

624
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:10,000
To make it seem like you fell by yourself.

625
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:13,833
- Seem to who?
- The police.

626
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:17,083
To make sure the doctor
didn't file a report.

627
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:23,041
Those bastards gave you whiskey
to cover themselves.

628
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:26,041
They created an alibi.

629
01:09:33,791 --> 01:09:35,666
Just worry about getting better now.

630
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:45,750
Don't have too much fun with the nurses!
I'll come back when I can.

631
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:49,291
You don't have to come back.

632
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:51,583
Take care, Nicola!

633
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:04,791
- You go over there, I'll go here.
- Alright.

634
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I'll be right back.

635
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:03,291
Honey, I must run home.
Will you wait for me? I'm sorry.

636
01:12:03,375 --> 01:12:05,666
Kisses, kisses. Big kiss!

637
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:08,208
Bye.

638
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:16,291
I'm glad you made a decision.

639
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,708
Sooner or later,
you need a Resi in your life.

640
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:23,958
"He who goes with Resi will be happy",
that is my motto.

641
01:12:24,041 --> 01:12:26,375
You're a handsome guy, not like...

642
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:42,166
You're not here to make love, huh?

643
01:12:43,541 --> 01:12:44,458
No.

644
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:49,541
No. I'm sorry, but...
I don't want you to lose out.

645
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:50,708
Here.

646
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:53,666
No, thanks.

647
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:56,166
- Take it.
- No, really.

648
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,375
What did you come here for?

649
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:14,458
They're looking for me, and I have to
hide.

650
01:13:19,916 --> 01:13:24,458
- You don't ask me who?
- I've stopped asking such questions.

651
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:29,750
I mind my own business now.
It's much better this way.

652
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:36,708
- Do you want something to eat?
- No.

653
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:40,541
Can I stay here tonight?

654
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:43,500
Listen.

655
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:46,875
Do you want scrambled eggs or fried?

656
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:48,708
Fried, thanks.

657
01:13:49,708 --> 01:13:53,625
Yes, better fried.
We can scramble them later.

658
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:58,916
Do you know if there's a red soil quarry
in the area?

659
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,291
Red soil?

660
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:02,666
No.

661
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:07,125
The only red things here are the bricks.

662
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:12,833
He disappeared?

663
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:15,500
He couldn't have vanished.

664
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:19,875
- The car?
- It's in the hotel parking lot.

665
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:24,416
- The motorbike is still there.
- He can't have left town.

666
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:29,208
He's hiding. Find him.
We must know what he has in mind.

667
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:31,166
Get going. Now!

668
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:32,291
I bought some stuff.

669
01:16:32,375 --> 01:16:37,791
Cheese, canned meat, beer,
vegetables. A bit of everything.

670
01:16:37,875 --> 01:16:41,041
You did well. I'm starving.

671
01:16:41,125 --> 01:16:44,000
How far have you gotten
with the investigation?

672
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:46,833
I can only make assumptions.

673
01:16:48,083 --> 01:16:50,625
Didn't you want to mind your own business?

674
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:53,333
Well?

675
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:56,625
I changed my mind. So what?

676
01:16:56,708 --> 01:17:00,500
I'm sure that everything
revolves around the racing business.

677
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:04,291
Muller must have found something out
about Mayer.

678
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:07,291
Weren't they more reassured
after getting rid of him?

679
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:10,625
Maybe Muller had gathered some documents.

680
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:17,833
They killed Inge, and went
to Nicola looking for the documents.

681
01:17:17,916 --> 01:17:20,750
Because he had an affair with Inge.

682
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:22,583
Muller, Inge, Nicola,

683
01:17:22,666 --> 01:17:24,416
and me too.

684
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:29,083
We must solve this equation.

685
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:34,625
- What?
- Muller gave Inge the documents.

686
01:17:35,208 --> 01:17:37,791
Since they're still looking for them,

687
01:17:38,458 --> 01:17:40,458
evidently...

688
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:45,416
They couldn't find them on Inge.

689
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:50,000
They are looking for me
because they think I have them.

690
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:55,166
Where are these documents?

691
01:17:57,166 --> 01:17:59,458
Excuse me, but why does...

692
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:04,583
Why Mayer cares so
much about those documents?

693
01:18:04,666 --> 01:18:07,000
What's so incriminating about them?

694
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:16,166
Please, caress me again like that.

695
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:19,708
It's been a long time,
I'd almost forgotten.

696
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:24,750
Excuse me. I have an idea.

697
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:30,291
Are you going out?

698
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:34,583
Be careful, those people are dangerous.

699
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:38,958
- They don't mess around.
- Don't worry.

700
01:18:39,041 --> 01:18:40,458
I'll be careful.

701
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:44,625
If something should happen to me,
go to Nicola.

702
01:18:45,208 --> 01:18:47,500
Tell him there's nothing wrong
with his leg.

703
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:51,875
Help him, if he needs to run away
from this shitty place. Bye.

704
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:09,375
I trust you because
you are a policeman, too.

705
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:12,500
Thanks. Chief...

706
01:21:13,875 --> 01:21:16,458
Schultz. Handcuffs, please.

707
01:21:17,458 --> 01:21:22,375
We know everything about Mayer
and his gang, the worst in the area.

708
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:27,791
Everything you told me
couldn't have happened by chance.

709
01:21:27,875 --> 01:21:30,833
Mayer is responsible
for those three accidents.

710
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,958
I can't do anything,
Mayer has connections up high.

711
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:36,958
One misstep, and I'm done for.

712
01:21:37,041 --> 01:21:42,666
But if you gave me proof, just one piece,

713
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:45,041
I would be the happiest man in the world.

714
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:52,500
I found Muller's documents,
and they can incriminate him.

715
01:21:52,583 --> 01:21:56,791
- You have them with you?
- I wasn't able to get them.

716
01:21:57,916 --> 01:21:59,500
May I know where they are?

717
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:04,583
I'll tell you at the right moment.
It's still early.

718
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:07,416
What do you want to do?

719
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:12,625
I don't really know, exactly.

720
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:20,333
Listen.

721
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:24,750
Try not to let Mayer leave the city.

722
01:22:25,416 --> 01:22:29,708
Have everyone believe
that I'm under arrest. Can you do that?

723
01:22:31,833 --> 01:22:34,333
Tonight you can sleep in cell number four.

724
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:35,291
Thanks.

725
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:39,666
Don't forget
to tell the warden to leave me the key.

726
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,250
The situation is not clear.

727
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:08,333
Pick up all the bets,
and get as much cash as possible.

728
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:13,166
- We must be prepared for the worst.
- Is there a problem?

729
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:16,541
- Maybe. I'm going to the racetrack.
- Alright.

730
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:23,083
Hey, Resi!

731
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:30,125
You came to see if I'll be a client?
Everyone's at the race.

732
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:34,166
I came to bring you news on your friend.

733
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:38,083
- How is the policeman?
- They arrested him.

734
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:43,125
- They arrested him?
- It's a long story.

735
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:47,666
- Are you crazy? I'm all broken up.
- You're fine!

736
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:50,333
- I'm fine?
- There's nothing wrong with you.

737
01:23:50,416 --> 01:23:55,208
Paolo set everything up
to get you out of this mess.

738
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:57,208
- Really?
- Really.

739
01:23:58,583 --> 01:24:03,333
Paolo said to tell you that
you must leave immediately.

740
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:06,500
- Before it's too late.
- Really?

741
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:11,916
You tell Paolo to mind his own business,
I can take care of myself.

742
01:24:12,541 --> 01:24:15,125
<i>We are close to the moment of truth.</i>

743
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:20,750
<i>Only the power of the engine matters,
along with the guts under the suit.</i>

744
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:27,041
<i>I wanted to organize a race
that thrills my supporters.</i>

745
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:31,833
<i>This year, I'll offer a show
worthy of my traditions.</i>

746
01:24:31,916 --> 01:24:36,166
<i>What you will soon see
is something you'll never see again.</i>

747
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:39,833
You can be sure of that.
They won't ever see it again.

748
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:43,541
<i>We are almost ready
for the race to begin.</i>

749
01:24:44,458 --> 01:24:49,208
<i>Participants are leaving the boxes
and heading to get checked.</i>

750
01:24:50,791 --> 01:24:54,041
<i>The bikes get checked
by federation commissioners.</i>

751
01:24:54,125 --> 01:24:59,666
<i>They embody the fairness
typical of speed cross races.</i>

752
01:25:00,916 --> 01:25:06,125
<i>After the check, the participants
rush to reach the racetrack,</i>

753
01:25:06,208 --> 01:25:08,000
<i>for the last test.</i>

754
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:20,333
I remind you that we are watching
the Neuerburg circuit live.

755
01:25:20,416 --> 01:25:25,541
<i>Here's the patron of the race, Mayer,
talking to the head of his team.</i>

756
01:25:25,625 --> 01:25:28,458
<i>We foresee a wonderful show.</i>

757
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:33,625
<i>The press grandstand
is crowded with journalists.</i>

758
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:35,791
<i>The checks are almost done,</i>

759
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:39,958
<i>and the participants receive last
minute advice from the mechanics.</i>

760
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:44,458
Wasn't he supposed to be at the hospital?

761
01:25:44,541 --> 01:25:47,000
Sure. How did he do it?

762
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:50,375
You are imbeciles.
Sabotage him during the race.

763
01:25:50,458 --> 01:25:54,791
And don't mess it up!
If he wins, it'll be a financial disaster.

764
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:58,791
- Almost everybody bet on him.
- Got you.

765
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:06,416
- What is it?
- A little something.

766
01:26:08,125 --> 01:26:11,000
Cute, huh? It cuts like a knife.

767
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:16,583
See you at the starting line.
I'll go fix the exhaust pipe.

768
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:29,916
Kurt!

769
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:34,166
You like to play rough, huh?

770
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:40,833
You'll see.

771
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
<i>The race will begin in a few minutes.</i>

772
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:14,458
<i>The participants
are reaching the starting bar.</i>

773
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:17,250
<i>We see number 85, a favourite,</i>

774
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:22,375
<i>who is here despite what was announced.</i>

775
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:28,666
<i>The participants are reaching
the starting point.</i>

776
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:32,208
<i>Ramirez, number 39,
is the reckless local racer</i>

777
01:28:32,291 --> 01:28:36,416
<i>who won first place last year.</i>

778
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:41,125
<i>We still don't see number 60, Kurt,
the other fearsome local champion.</i>

779
01:28:41,708 --> 01:28:46,166
<i>He's usually on time.
He's coming out of the pit box now!</i>

780
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:52,208
<i>Mr. Mayer asks him to hurry up.</i>

781
01:29:10,458 --> 01:29:14,916
<i>Number 60, Kurt, takes his position, too.</i>

782
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,125
<i>Another few participants,
and the race will begin.</i>

783
01:29:36,083 --> 01:29:39,291
<i>There we go! They're off!</i>

784
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:41,333
<i>A flying start!</i>

785
01:29:41,416 --> 01:29:43,916
<i>Two participants are on the ground,</i>

786
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,333
<i>while all the others
are headed to the first bump.</i>

787
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:20,916
A group of three racers
is firmly in the lead.

788
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,458
Here's number 85. Incredible!

789
01:31:23,541 --> 01:31:28,250
He steps up and attacks
with extraordinary determination.

790
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:53,750
<i>We are holding our breath.</i>

791
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:57,291
<i>Number 85 is not a veteran,</i>

792
01:32:57,375 --> 01:32:59,916
unprepared for this kind of race.

793
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,208
He is in the most difficult position,
heading the group.

794
01:33:03,291 --> 01:33:07,041
He can easily be attacked
by those behind him.

795
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:29,291
We just saw something
very rare in speed cross!

796
01:33:29,375 --> 01:33:31,833
Kurt saved 85 from getting hit!

797
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:54,166
<i>28 and 68 haven't made it
through the fifth lap.</i>

798
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,208
Mr. Mayer. Mr. Mayer!

799
01:34:06,375 --> 01:34:10,375
I was looking for you. We must tell
the race director to stop Kurt.

800
01:34:10,458 --> 01:34:13,916
He's not racing.
I was coming to advise you.

801
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,583
The police arrested him.
Someone beat him up.

802
01:34:17,666 --> 01:34:22,541
- He was tied up in the storage closet.
- Who is that son of a bitch?

803
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:27,333
Get all the cash.
Put it inside the briefcase in my car.

804
01:34:56,875 --> 01:35:00,500
<i>Mr. Mayer is going up the stairs
to the VIP section,</i>

805
01:35:00,583 --> 01:35:04,125
<i>where the representatives
of this town are seated.</i>

806
01:35:05,041 --> 01:35:10,666
{\an8}<i>Next to him is the well-known
Chief Brown.</i>

807
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:14,541
{\an8}<i>"Brown the Tiger",
as some affectionately call him.</i>

808
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:20,166
{\an8}<i>He seems satisfied.
He loves races and is having fun.</i>

809
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:22,583
<i>But let's get back to the race.</i>

810
01:35:42,583 --> 01:35:47,083
There's been a collision between two
motorbikes, and a third was involved.

811
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:50,750
This is the latest information.

812
01:35:50,833 --> 01:35:55,291
The rescue team is heading
to where the flames are rising.

813
01:36:16,333 --> 01:36:19,791
We've reached the last laps
of this exciting race.

814
01:36:19,875 --> 01:36:23,291
The crowd is standing
for this final round.

815
01:36:23,375 --> 01:36:27,208
The authorities are getting ready
to give the awards.

816
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:37,000
<i>Mayer is totally fascinated by this race.</i>

817
01:37:04,916 --> 01:37:09,250
85 is still leading,
followed by number 60

818
01:37:09,333 --> 01:37:12,750
and 39, the other local champion.

819
01:37:34,083 --> 01:37:37,958
<i>87 has sadly gone off-track, too.</i>

820
01:37:38,041 --> 01:37:41,875
<i>A few laps to go before the finish line.</i>

821
01:37:43,166 --> 01:37:45,583
<i>We are at the last lap.</i>

822
01:37:45,666 --> 01:37:49,458
<i>The participants face
the final hurdles of the race,</i>

823
01:37:49,541 --> 01:37:53,166
<i>which is being dominated
by a group in the lead.</i>

824
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:58,125
<i>Three racers are fighting
to win first place.</i>

825
01:38:21,291 --> 01:38:22,291
Mr. Mayer?

826
01:38:23,666 --> 01:38:24,625
Yes?

827
01:38:27,291 --> 01:38:28,916
The race is about to end.

828
01:38:29,833 --> 01:38:32,875
You don't want to miss the finish.
Please, come this way.

829
01:38:33,666 --> 01:38:34,791
Please.

830
01:38:46,541 --> 01:38:48,416
After you, sir.

831
01:39:28,833 --> 01:39:32,041
<i>39 and 60 are vying for first place,</i>

832
01:39:32,125 --> 01:39:35,291
<i>firmly held down
by the amazing number 85.</i>

833
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:56,083
<i>39 is out of the race, too.</i>

834
01:40:02,125 --> 01:40:06,958
There is a duel between 60 and 85
over the few meters remaining.

835
01:40:15,833 --> 01:40:20,125
<i>85 crosses the finish line
and wins the race!</i>

836
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,333
It's me, Paolo!

837
01:40:27,416 --> 01:40:29,416
Don't you recognize me? I'm Paolo!

838
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:31,875
Well done!

839
01:40:32,916 --> 01:40:37,541
Nicola, are you still upset with me?
Come on. Let's stop this!

840
01:40:39,041 --> 01:40:41,125
Cheers for the champion!

841
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:53,083
Great! Great, guys! You made it!

842
01:40:54,083 --> 01:40:55,833
Come up!

843
01:41:13,541 --> 01:41:15,125
Bravo, Nicola!

844
01:41:17,041 --> 01:41:18,791
You are the best!

845
01:41:40,333 --> 01:41:42,708
- Shall we go?
- No, no!

846
01:41:43,666 --> 01:41:45,416
Just a moment, please.

847
01:41:55,458 --> 01:41:56,541
One...

848
01:41:59,375 --> 01:42:01,750
