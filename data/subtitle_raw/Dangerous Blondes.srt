reputation as an amateur detective.

And by the way, Mr Craig.
You know Inspector Clinton, don't you?

Yes. On several occasions when I've been
engaged in a little amateur sleuthing ..

bumped into me as he so aptly puts it ..

What is a panopticon?

45
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,662
A panopticon is a circular prison ..

are visible from a central tower.

I know my own name.

the question please?

Who invented the machine gun?

69
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:56,173
Mr Gatling.

70

I know who that is as well
as I know my own name.

71
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,242

- Yes, Mr Gatling.

Sorry, detective Gatling. Time is up.
That eliminates you.

Who invented the machine gun? I know
that as well as I know my own name.

What is your own name?

00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:23,436

gun was invented by another Gatling.

What's the matter, darling?
- I must see Barry now. Where is he?

00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:42,205
He is on the radio. It's a quiz contest.
- When will he be home?

When the program is over.
What's the matter?

You look like you've seen a ghost.
- Where's the matte?

Someone was going to commit murder
in the darkroom. Chloroform.

00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:51,647
He flashed a light in my face.
- Wait a minute.

90
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:54,354
Sit down and get your breath.

91
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:56,459
You're a little hysterical.

92
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:57,894
I'll get you some sherry.

93
00:05:58,084 --> 00:05:59,271
I don't want any sherry.

94
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:01,707
I suppose it will take
Barry ages to get home?

double talk and speak slowly ..

98

00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:11,725
Nothing has happened yet.
That is, nothing serious.

murder unless we stop it.

Who is going to murder who?
- I don't know, Jane. I don't know.

102
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,146
But whoever was with me in that darkroom
this afternoon was there to kill.

103
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,476
He had a handkerchief in his
hand reeking of chloroform.

104
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:25,980
Then he put a flashlight in
my face and I screamed.

105
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,078
Then all of a sudden I heard the
door to the darkroom open and close.

106
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:31,357
Evidently whoever was there
was after someone else ..

107
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:33,501
Because when he put
the light in my face, I ..

108
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,744
Now wait a minute. Come on
over and sit down. Try to relax.

But you are excited, sure. Look Julie.

00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:45,090
You talk about all this happening in a
darkroom. What do you mean 'darkroom'?

112
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:46,778
I am sorry. I thought you knew.

113
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:50,926
For the past 3 months I've been working
for the McCormick Photography Studio.

114
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:54,035
Oh, I see. And by 'darkroom'
you mean a developing room.

115
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:56,159
That is right.
- Have you quit the theater?

116
00:06:56,487 --> 00:06:57,874
I'm afraid the theater quit me.

117
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:00,454
So, I took a job posing
for the McCormick studio.

118
00:07:00,814 --> 00:07:03,784
I sort-of worked myself in until I am
now chief cook and bottle washer.

rather a rough time of it lately.

didn't even get paid last week.

124
00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:18,472
And then came our big break.

125
00:07:18,746 --> 00:07:22,027
Yesterday, the Cottrell Silver Company
said they would give us a terrific deal.

126
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:25,187
If we could get Mrs Isabel Fleming
to endorse their product.

127
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:27,492
You mean <i>the</i> Isabel Fleming?
- Yes.

128
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:29,223
The wealthy society lady?

129
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:30,350
Yes.

130
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:33,984
How can you hope to get a snooty old gal
like her to pose for an advertisement?

131
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:36,508
Well, her niece Erika
McCormick is the boss's wife.

132
00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:37,388
Oh.

133
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:38,921
Did you swing the deal?

134
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:41,189
We took the photograph an hour ago.

135
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:42,808
Everything went like clockwork.

136
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:45,256
And after that I went into the darkroom.

137
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:46,911
And <i>then</i> is when it happened.

138
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,631
I thought, first I'd tell Mack and then
I decided I'd better get Barry's advice.

139
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:52,821
So I sneaked away and came over here.

We have to take the picture
over again tonight.

152
00:08:21,878 --> 00:08:24,020
The negatives are missing.
We can't find them anywhere.

153
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,855
Isn't that a rather odd thing to happen?

154
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:27,299
Jane, I am scared.

155
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:30,864
Do you see? Someone took the negatives
so we would have to retake the picture.

156
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:32,896
So we would all have to come back there.

157
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,222
Whoever it is wants another chance.

158
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:37,940
Maybe tonight he will ..

But how did he know you were here?

165
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:56,555

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,181
"<i>That only leaves Inspector
Clinton for the detectives</i>."

176
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:45,314
"<i>And Mr Craig for the
detective fiction writers</i>."

177
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,874
"<i>Now we have the jackpot question</i>."

178
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:52,244
In a moment the attendant will hold
in front of you gentlemen ten objects.

179
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:56,389
You will have only ten seconds to look
at them and memorise as many as you can.

180
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:00,518
They will then be taken away and you'll
have five seconds to name each article.

181
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:01,847
Alright, Miss.

182
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:03,684
Now ..

183
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,354
Mr Craig, if you step over here
to this microphone please.

184
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:08,514
And Inspector, if you
would come up on my left.

185
00:10:10,422 --> 00:10:12,288
Alright, gentlemen. Are you ready?

186
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:13,818
Alright. Here we are.

187
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:16,314
One second.

188
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:17,663
Two seconds.

189
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:18,974
Three.

190
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:20,138
Four.

191
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:21,514
Five.

192
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:22,741
Six.

193
00:10:23,342 --> 00:10:24,019
Seven.

194
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,471
Eight.

195
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,010
Nine.

196
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,965
Ten.

197
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:29,630
Alright. Take it away.

198
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:32,820
Alright, Mr Craig.
It's your first guess.

199
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:35,534
A pair of handcuffs.
- One.

200
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:37,897
A ring.
- Two.

201
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,839
A revolver.
- Three.

202
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,431
A cartridge clip.

203
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:43,438
Four.

204
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:45,661
A knife.
- Five.

205
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,438
A silver dollar.

206
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:53,434
Six.

207
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:55,748
A flashlight.

208
00:10:56,245 --> 00:10:57,036
Seven.

209
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:02,424
A watch.

210
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,283
Splendid. That's eight.
Alright, Mr Craig.

211
00:11:06,588 --> 00:11:08,408
Come on Barry. Come on, Barry.

212
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:09,669
A key.

213
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:10,794
Excellent.

214
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,362
And now, Inspector.

215
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:13,754
The last one.

216
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:21,579
I'm sorry, Inspector.
But your time is up.

217
00:11:21,787 --> 00:11:24,975
As so often happens, Inspector.
You overlooked the obvious.

218
00:11:25,238 --> 00:11:26,866
Let him have four of my five seconds.

219
00:11:27,147 --> 00:11:30,191
That's a very sporting gesture.
Alright, Inspector. Go ahead.

220
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:32,150
If you are so smart, what is it?

221
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,988
The great big beautiful tray that the
other nine objects were resting upon.

222
00:11:36,392 --> 00:11:37,121
Correct.

223
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:41,434
And that's the guy who can't
remember to mail a letter.

224
00:11:42,156 --> 00:11:47,327
And now for the final score for the
losing detective team: 200 points.

225
00:11:47,713 --> 00:11:50,451
And for the winning detective
fiction writers team:

226
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:53,065
210 points.

227
00:11:56,518 --> 00:12:00,096
And now ladies and gentlemen, the
Tom Taylor Cigar program is happy ..

228
00:12:00,363 --> 00:12:03,501
To present to the captain of the winning
detective fiction writers team ..

229
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:06,659
This beautiful 21-jewel wristwatch.

230
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:07,998
Thank you.

231
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:12,797
And to the less observant
captain of the losing team.

232
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:16,543
The Sherlock Holmes magnifying glass.

233
00:12:37,986 --> 00:12:39,120
Hiya, princess.

234
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:42,179
What's the matter with the lights?
On the blink again?

235
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:46,676
Jane.

236
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:54,421
Hey, Jane.

237
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:08,151
It's nearly three o'clock.

238
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:09,927
Could she have left me?

239
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,803
I haven't done anything wrong in days.

240
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,669
Wait a minute. When was it I squawked
about the Yanks? No, that wasn't it.

241
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:20,367
If she's upstairs playing
gin rummy again ..

242
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:22,743
Jane.

243
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:24,732
Jane.

244
00:13:27,554 --> 00:13:28,484
Oh, sweetheart.

245
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:30,486
What's the matter? What happened?

246
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:32,752
How did it happen? Did you fall?

247
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,507
Are you hurt, sweetheart?

248
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:38,029
Why, it's Mrs Swanson.

249
00:13:39,254 --> 00:13:40,785
Thank heavens it's you, Mrs Swanson.

250
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:42,763
I felt sure it was my wife.

251
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:44,491
Lie down. You'll be alright.

252
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:47,007
I'll get you some water.

253
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:55,111
Easy does it now. You are alright.

254
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:56,935
There you are.

255
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,371
Oh, Mr Craig.

256
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:02,218
Alright. What happened? You fell down?
- No, sir.

257
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,342
He struck me.
- He did?

258
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,283
Who did?

259
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,442
I don't know. I never did
get a good look at him.

260
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:09,407
Is Mrs Craig alright?
- Yes. Of course.

261
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:11,848
I mean I don't know. I searched
around but I can't find her.

262
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,544
I do hope nothing happened.

263
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:15,786
You can say that again.
What was this man doing?

264
00:14:16,051 --> 00:14:19,081
He was listening at the door and your
wife was talking to another woman.

265
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:20,870
I could just hear their voices.

266
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:23,205
What time was this?
- Let me see.

267
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:27,195
I finished scrubbing the
upper floor at 7 o'clock.

268
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:30,790
I came down here to put away my mop
and my bucket and look at the furnace.

269
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,511
Always, Mr Weaver has me tend
the furnace before I go to bed ..

270
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:35,271
Alright. But what happened?

271
00:14:35,686 --> 00:14:39,047
As I came down the back stairs
I saw this man. His back was to me.

272
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:42,784
He was listening at your door and
I called out. I don't know why I did.

273
00:14:43,105 --> 00:14:44,721
I guess I thought I could frighten him.

274
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,530
He turned to run down the hall.
I made a grab for him and he struck me.

275
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:52,387
You didn't recognise the voice of
the woman talking to my wife?

276
00:14:52,577 --> 00:14:53,713
Did you?
- No, sir.

277
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:55,445
Here, take a little drink of this.

278
00:14:57,707 --> 00:14:58,859
Listening to my wife.

279
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:02,041
Now, why would anybody
want to listen to my wife?

280
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,904
I wonder what she's got
herself mixed up in now.

281
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:34,878
Bad news?
- I hope not.

282
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:43,755
You'll find an ice-bag in the
bathroom, Mrs Swanson.

283
00:15:43,945 --> 00:15:45,991
You'd better put some cold
applications on that head.

284
00:15:55,815 --> 00:15:57,743
Help yourself to anything
you want, Mrs Swanson.

285
00:15:57,933 --> 00:15:59,653
Just make yourself at home.

286
00:16:48,322 --> 00:16:49,439
[ Female scream! ]

287
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:53,649
What's the matter, lady?

288
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,151
I'm sorry. I ..

289
00:16:57,362 --> 00:16:58,457
I? I what?

290
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,805
For a minute I thought it was real.

291
00:17:02,265 --> 00:17:04,275
Well, that's just splendid.

292
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:06,425
Too bad you aren't the advertiser.

293
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:07,590
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:11,125
Say, who told you to barge
in like this anyway?

295
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:13,705
I was looking for Miss Julie Taylor.

296
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,658
She's in Studio 2. Second floor.

297
00:17:16,114 --> 00:17:18,274
Close that door when you go out.
We have work to do here.

298
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:19,609
Excuse me.

299
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:27,907
Julie.

300
00:17:34,092 --> 00:17:34,764
Julie.

301
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:36,440
Jane.

302
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:39,042
I was just going to telephone you.

303
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:42,186
What about? What is wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing is wrong.

304
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:45,303
As a matter of fact, I was going to
tell you not to bother to come over.

305
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:48,541
Everything is going smoothly.
We're all set to take the picture.

306
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:52,362
I don't get it. Didn't you tell Mack and
the others what happened this afternoon?

307
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:53,779
No.

308
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:55,262
No, I didn't.
- Why not?

309
00:17:58,323 --> 00:17:58,993
Well.

310
00:18:00,222 --> 00:18:02,269
Because I came to the
conclusion that I ..

311
00:18:02,635 --> 00:18:03,990
I was just imagining things.

312
00:18:04,327 --> 00:18:06,434
You mean, you <i>imagined</i>
someone trying to grab you?

313
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:08,521
You <i>imagined</i> you smelled chloroform?

314
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,587
It could have been
someone playing a joke.

315
00:18:11,844 --> 00:18:12,656
A joke?

316
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:15,164
Besides, this picture means
everything to the boss.

317
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:17,558
If it doesn't turn out, he's finished.
He is through.

318
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:21,071
If Mrs Fleming and the others find out
there's no telling what will happen.

319
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:23,857
They might walk out on her before
he gets the picture and then ..

320
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,313
Mack would ..
- I see.

321
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:27,605
You're in love with Mack, aren't you?

322
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:29,462
Mack is married.

323
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:31,303
That doesn't answer my question.

324
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:32,727
No.

325
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:35,123
No. I'm not in love with him.

326
00:18:35,598 --> 00:18:36,985
Does that answer your question?

327
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,137
Well. It's an answer.

328
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:41,228
He's a grand guy, Jane.

329
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:44,889
If you met him you'd understand.
- Why don't you introduce me to him?

330
00:18:45,285 --> 00:18:48,261
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Of course I'll introduce you to him.

331
00:18:48,716 --> 00:18:52,193
I want you to meet all of them. Kirk can
do it too. I've told them all about you.

332
00:18:52,737 --> 00:18:53,452
Jane.

333
00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:55,659
You won't say anything?
- Of course not.

334
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:57,142
What about Barry?

335
00:18:57,726 --> 00:18:59,288
I left a note for him to come here.

336
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:01,666
Don't worry. I'll get to him
first and explain everything.

337
00:19:01,953 --> 00:19:03,856
You're an angel.
- Well, thanks.

338
00:19:04,586 --> 00:19:07,276
You'd better open the door a little
wider and let my wings through.

339
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:21,837
Excuse me.

340
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,191
That's alright.

341
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,542
[ Whistle ]

342
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:27,946
That's it. Hold it.

343
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:30,861
Now, move the candelabra
a little more to the right.

344
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:33,336
A little more.

345
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:35,368
Just a little more.

346
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,767
Hey, boys.

347
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:39,465
Boys, I want you to meet Jane Craig.

348
00:19:39,898 --> 00:19:42,001
You've heard me speak of her
and here she is in person.

349
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:43,357
She really is cute.

350
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:45,325
<i>Mrs</i> Jane Craig, Mr Fenley.

351
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:47,027
This is Kirk.
- How do you do.

352
00:19:47,294 --> 00:19:49,199
This is Harry Duerr,
the assistant genius.

353
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:50,986
Kirk, let go of her hand.

354
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:51,944
Oh.

355
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:55,498
How do you do.
- Yeah.

356
00:19:56,312 --> 00:19:58,829
Mack. I want you to meet
my pal, Jane Craig.

357
00:19:59,112 --> 00:19:59,784
Hello.

358
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:01,176
Mack.
- Huh?

359
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,678
Oh, I am sorry.

360
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:05,175
This is Jane Craig - Mr McCormick.

361
00:20:05,423 --> 00:20:07,322
Mr McCormick and I have met before.
- Really?

362
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:08,290
You have?

363
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:10,258
Yes. I ran into him downstairs.

364
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,004
He told me how to find you.

365
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,352
Oh, yes. I remember.
Sorry if I was rude.

366
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:16,893
That's alright. I had no
business barging in like that.

367
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:18,877
That's okay. Everything set, boys?

368
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:19,857
All set.

369
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:21,920
Better round up the people, Julie.
- Yes, Mack.

370
00:20:22,382 --> 00:20:25,803
Look, if you'll stand right over here
you can see exactly how it's done.

371
00:20:26,086 --> 00:20:27,273
I'll only be a minute.

372
00:20:31,202 --> 00:20:32,783
Miss Lawrence.
- Coming.

373
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:36,419
Whenever you're ready, Mrs Fleming.

374
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,910
I'll be right there.

375
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,220
Alright, folks. On the set please.
- Okay.

376
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:45,035
You owe me a dollar and a half.
- I know. I know.

377
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:48,106
What time is it anyway?
- Nine o'clock. Right on the dot.

378
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:51,299
Don't say this thing comes off on time.
- I hope so. I've got a date.

379
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:56,807
Alright, folks. Take the same positions
at the table you had this afternoon.

380
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,674
Miss Lawrence, you sit here please.

381
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:03,474
Careful of the silverware, folks.
It has all been counted.

382
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,787
Joke.
- The joke is over.

383
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,227
How does it look, Kirk?

384
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,071
Terrific. Will you quit worrying?

385
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,356
I'm not worrying.

386
00:21:10,546 --> 00:21:12,229
We're all set. Bring on Madam Queen.

387
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:13,823
Alright, I will get her.

388
00:21:15,891 --> 00:21:19,637
Miss Ralston, as we do the take, can you
look at the silver and <i>not</i> the camera?

389
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:22,660
This picture is for Cottrell Silverware,
not your Hollywood agent.

390
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:26,251
Now look, Mr Fenley. If you don't like
my work you can get someone else.

391
00:21:26,497 --> 00:21:28,950
Now, now, Miss Ralston.
He didn't mean any harm.

392
00:21:29,316 --> 00:21:30,188
Just kidding.

393
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:31,997
Well, I don't like the way he kids.

394
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:37,747
I was just coming for you.
- Evening, Ralph.

395
00:21:38,017 --> 00:21:39,260
Good evening, aunt Isabel.

396
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,949
I hate dragging you out on a
miserable night like this, but ..

397
00:21:42,214 --> 00:21:44,268
I promised to deliver the
photograph in the morning.

398
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:47,263
Don't be absurd. I like rainy weather.
I always did.

399
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:50,015
My husband used to say I
was a regular mud hen.

400
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:52,941
You know, I cannot imagine what
happened to those negatives.

401
00:21:58,532 --> 00:21:59,313
Ralph.

402
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:00,885
Yes. What is it?

403
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:02,890
That woman in the far corner.

404
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:04,854
She wasn't here this afternoon.

405
00:22:07,144 --> 00:22:07,995
No, no.

406
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:11,280
We couldn't locate the model who posed
this afternoon so we've a substitute.

407
00:22:11,742 --> 00:22:13,906
Well, I'm sorry. But she won't do.

408
00:22:14,595 --> 00:22:15,451
Won't do?

409
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:16,925
I don't understand.

410
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,930
I mean I will not be
photographed with her.

411
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:20,389
I don't like her.

412
00:22:21,194 --> 00:22:22,810
But aunt Isabel ..
- Let's not argue.

413
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:25,210
Get someone else.
I'll be in my dressing room.

414
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:33,361
Folks, everyone go out and have a smoke.
We're having a little technical trouble.

415
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,175
Technical trouble?
What are you talking about?

416
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:40,643
I said 'technical trouble'.

417
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:41,896
Oh.

418
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:44,199
Miss Lawrence.

419
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:47,071
The model who posed this
afternoon just arrived.

420
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:49,585
I think she's a little
more suitable so ..

421
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:52,639
I'm afraid we won't need you.
I'll send you your check in the morning.

422
00:22:53,245 --> 00:22:54,454
Yes, Mr McCormick.

423
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:56,122
I understand perfectly.

424
00:22:58,805 --> 00:23:01,143
What's this all about?
- Mrs Fleming objected to her.

425
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:03,449
Why?
- She didn't say why.

426
00:23:03,978 --> 00:23:05,338
What do you know?
- Julie.

427
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,683
Get changed quick.
You'll take her place.

428
00:23:07,873 --> 00:23:10,006
We haven't time to get another model.
- Alright.

429
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:12,384
Mind if I tag along, Julie?
- No. Come on.

430
00:23:13,998 --> 00:23:16,254
Didn't she give any reason at all, Mack?
- No.

431
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:40,302
[ Crying noises ]

432
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,454
[ Crying noises ]

433
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,068
That reminds me.

434
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:08,582
I must write Barry's uncle.

435
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:16,115
Boy.

436
00:25:16,442 --> 00:25:18,730
Whoever tore up these negatives
certainly, did a good job.

437
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:21,344
Why would anyone do it?
- I don't know.

438
00:25:21,743 --> 00:25:23,838
How did you happen to find them, Harry?
- Well, I ..

439
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:26,604
Threw an envelope in the basket
when I worked in here today.

440
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,423
And I suddenly remembered
there was an address on it.

441
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:31,536
So I came in here to get it and ..

442
00:25:32,384 --> 00:25:34,708
There you are.
- Where is the envelope?

443
00:25:35,094 --> 00:25:35,816
I ..

444
00:25:36,837 --> 00:25:37,478
I ..

445
00:25:38,977 --> 00:25:39,935
It's right here.

446
00:25:40,403 --> 00:25:42,065
Wasn't it underneath the negatives?

447
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:43,673
Underneath?

448
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:45,273
Why, no.

449
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,994
I didn't pay particular attention.

450
00:25:49,228 --> 00:25:50,501
I think it was to one side.

451
00:25:51,072 --> 00:25:53,202
You got a pretty tight
story anyway, Harry.

452
00:25:53,538 --> 00:25:56,038
Wait a minute, Kirk. If you're
insinuating I tore those negatives ..

453
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,163
Why, Harry. Nobody is
accusing you of anything.

454
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,913
Why did he say he's not accusing me?

455
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:03,149
I'm sorry. I'm just a bit jittery today.
Things have been so upset.

456
00:26:03,414 --> 00:26:05,116
Come on, boys.
Let's get back to the set.

457
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,312
Good evening.

458
00:26:47,502 --> 00:26:49,424
Decidedly. Assuming one is a duck.

459
00:26:49,911 --> 00:26:51,127
I'm looking for my wife.

460
00:27:01,012 --> 00:27:03,410
Rather an unusual night to play
hide-and-go-seek, isn't it?

461
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,678
I was going to meet my wife here
at the McCormick studios, but ..

462
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:09,448
This place seems to
be practically deserted.

463
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,806
Maybe she's on the second floor.
That's where they're taking the photos.

464
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:41,653
I beg your pardon but if you
are still looking for your wife ..

465
00:27:53,879 --> 00:27:55,643
Gee, is this as fast as this thing goes?

466
00:27:55,979 --> 00:27:57,109
Yep. Got it wide open.

467
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:00,645
She don't go up like no rocket but
she don't fall down like one either.

468
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:03,039
How long have you been
running an elevator, skipper?

469
00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:05,177
Well, now let me see.

470
00:28:05,628 --> 00:28:08,427
I got out of the
Spanish-American war in '99.

471
00:28:09,186 --> 00:28:11,662
I was a bartender for ten
years but had to give it up.

472
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:13,236
My liver went bad on me.

473
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:16,966
Let me see. That was '08.
The same year I lost my teeth.

474
00:28:17,453 --> 00:28:20,930
Yep. I remember exactly because
I got my plates in 1911.

475
00:28:21,898 --> 00:28:23,521
In '14 I got married.

476
00:28:23,872 --> 00:28:25,273
I didn't work for four years.

477
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:29,737
Let me see now. My wife left me
in '18 so I went back to work.

478
00:28:30,064 --> 00:28:32,691
So I have been here 23 years.

479
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:37,353
Excepting 3 weeks back in '33 when
they repealed the 18th amendment.

480
00:28:37,989 --> 00:28:40,387
So you tried bartending again, huh?

481
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:41,709
Nope. Celebrating.

482
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:43,663
Now my gallbladder is no good.

483
00:28:44,453 --> 00:28:48,214
Let me see. That makes
23 years minus 3 weeks.

484
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:52,708
That's 22 years, 11 months and
one week I've run this elevator.

485
00:28:55,405 --> 00:28:57,966
This has all been very interesting.
Now, will you please open the door?

486
00:29:03,094 --> 00:29:04,453
Say, this is the second floor?

487
00:29:04,647 --> 00:29:06,750
Nope. The third. The second
floor is the next one down.

488
00:29:07,085 --> 00:29:09,188
Going down to the second floor?
- Of course. Certainly.

489
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,210
Alright.

490
00:29:10,463 --> 00:29:11,563
Second floor it is.

491
00:29:15,911 --> 00:29:18,709
By the way, skipper.
You said you lost your teeth one year.

492
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:20,893
And you didn't get your
plates until 3 years later.

493
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:23,120
That's correct.
- What held you up so long?

494
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:25,170
Now that's a long story.

495
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,355
For goodness sakes.
We'll end up in the basement.

496
00:29:27,645 --> 00:29:30,415
Nope. You'll end up back on the third
floor. It takes a round trip to tell it.

497
00:29:34,178 --> 00:29:35,250
Are we here already?

498
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,885
It does a little better downhill.

499
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:51,906
Hello, princess.
- Hello.

500
00:29:52,722 --> 00:29:54,287
Hi, Barry. Be with you in a minute.

501
00:29:54,556 --> 00:29:56,715
Tell Mrs Fleming her secretary
is here to drive her home.

502
00:29:56,905 --> 00:29:57,859
Yes. Certainly.

503
00:30:03,332 --> 00:30:04,691
What's it all about, princess?

504
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:06,848
Well, if you're through
looking at the scenery.

505
00:30:07,354 --> 00:30:08,684
Sit down and I'll tell you.

506
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:11,028
[ Female scream! ]

507
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:17,035
Julie.
- Julie, what happened?

508
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:18,508
What's happened to her?

509
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:19,785
She saw that.

510
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:24,794
Shut the door, Jane.

511
00:30:39,817 --> 00:30:40,833

- Yes?

512
00:30:41,023 --> 00:30:42,610
I'm Ralph McCormick.
- How do you do.

513
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:43,645
Not so good.

514
00:30:44,023 --> 00:30:46,755
It happened on the second floor and I
felt it best to keep everyone up there.

515
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:49,060
Mr McCormick.
- Yes?

516
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,508
Was it you who phoned headquarters?
- That's right.

518
00:30:52,722 --> 00:30:53,480
Going up.

The report said Mrs Isabel Fleming.

520
00:30:59,218 --> 00:31:00,090
That's right.

521
00:31:01,884 --> 00:31:03,844
Say, old-timer. Can't we
make a little more speed?

522
00:31:04,337 --> 00:31:05,987
Not unless you want to take the stairs.

523
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:08,150
That is an idea. Drop her down.

524
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:13,777
This thing will shake your teeth out.

525
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:15,966
Not mine. I keep them
buttoned up in my pocket.

526
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:23,654
Step down please.

527
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:28,169
So I fell down.

528
00:31:28,923 --> 00:31:31,294
Ride with the old boy in the
elevator and see what he knows.

529
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,984
It's down the hall, Inspector.

530
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:39,420
Step up please.

531
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:44,912
Alright. Let's go.

532
00:31:45,677 --> 00:31:47,636
Now, old-timer. I want to
ask you a few questions.

533
00:31:47,826 --> 00:31:48,612
Fire away.

534
00:31:48,892 --> 00:31:49,879
What's your name?

535
00:31:50,112 --> 00:31:52,132
Edward E. Philpot. What's yours?
- Gatling.

536
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:53,973
Hey, I'm asking the questions.

537
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,546
How long you worked here?

538
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:57,410
Well, let me see now.

539
00:31:57,813 --> 00:32:01,372
I was mustered out of the
Spanish-American war in 1899.

540
00:32:01,785 --> 00:32:03,474
Got a job right off bartending.

541
00:32:03,703 --> 00:32:07,103
I hung on to it up until the
year after the panic in 1908.

542
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:09,202
The same year I lost my teeth.

543
00:32:09,947 --> 00:32:12,490
Look. All I want to know is,
how long have you worked here?

544
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,347
Now you got me off the track.

545
00:32:14,956 --> 00:32:16,947
Let me see now. As I was saying.

546
00:32:17,322 --> 00:32:21,224
I got out of the Spanish-American
war in 1899.

547
00:32:21,693 --> 00:32:24,289
Mr Kenyon, did you by any chance
see Miss Lawrence leave?

548
00:32:24,706 --> 00:32:25,852
No I didn't.

549
00:32:26,691 --> 00:32:28,222
You knew her personally, didn't you?

550
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:29,651
Only slightly.

551
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:31,776
What do you do, Mr Kenyon?

552
00:32:32,106 --> 00:32:33,520
I'm a dancer in a nightclub.

553
00:32:33,877 --> 00:32:35,061
Where's this nightclub?

554
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:37,431
Just off Sheridan Square.
The Club Cupid.

555
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,590
Oh sure. I know that place well.

556
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:45,171
That is, I've walked by it a good
many times and saw the sign.

557
00:32:45,387 --> 00:32:46,271
It's a dump.

558
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,342
But I won't be there always.
- Where do you live?

559
00:32:49,622 --> 00:32:50,968
322 Bank Street.

560
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:52,896
That is ..

561
00:32:53,275 --> 00:32:54,881
The same building Mr Snyder lives in.

562
00:32:55,313 --> 00:32:55,998
Yeah.

563
00:32:56,232 --> 00:32:57,640
We live in the same apartment.

564
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:58,956
Yeah. That's right.

565
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:01,392
Right this way, Inspector.

566
00:33:01,582 --> 00:33:03,112
Good evening, Inspector.
- Evening.

567
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,944
The body is in dressing room Number 2.

568
00:33:05,294 --> 00:33:06,237
Number 2, huh?

569
00:33:12,114 --> 00:33:13,300
What are you doing here?

570
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,376
Just moseying around.
Asking questions, taking notes.

571
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:19,610
I have written them down. If you're
interested you might save repetition.

572
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:22,352
And by the way, I'd like you to
meet my wife - Inspector Clinton.

573
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,786
How do you do, Inspector?

574
00:33:23,976 --> 00:33:26,902
You made good time getting
over here, Inspector.

575
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:28,714
It only took you fifteen minutes.

576
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:30,385
Why Barry, isn't that a new watch?

577
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:32,359
Yes. The Inspector made
me a present of it.

578
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:34,305
Oh Inspector. How sweet.

579
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,381
Do you mind telling me how
you happen to be here?

580
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:40,599
I just .. happened to drop
in to pick up my wife.

581
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,590
I see. And she just happened to be here?

582
00:33:43,091 --> 00:33:44,274
No. You see, I ..

583
00:33:49,205 --> 00:33:49,820
Yes.

584
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:52,958
You see, I happened to
drop in to see a friend.

585
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:54,127
Miss Taylor.

586
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:55,946
Who happens to work here.

587
00:33:56,547 --> 00:33:57,975
And then the murder happened?

588
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:00,224
You don't happen to know who did it?

589
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:01,739
Unfortunately, no.

590
00:34:02,551 --> 00:34:04,843
You've done a very thorough job here.
- Thank you.

591
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,317
You don't mind if I look
at the body, do you?

592
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:10,160
Not at all. Go right ahead.
- Thanks.

593
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:15,323
What have you found out, Doc?

594
00:34:15,544 --> 00:34:17,590
The jugular vein was severed
with a sharp instrument.

595
00:34:17,926 --> 00:34:19,113
Never knew what hit her.

596
00:34:19,452 --> 00:34:21,253
What did you find, Temple?
- Only a handbag.

597
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:23,110
The money and jewels are still in it.

598
00:34:23,755 --> 00:34:24,799
A pair of scissors.

599
00:34:25,374 --> 00:34:27,576
Could it have been the scissors?
- No.

600
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,902
The wound is big enough to
have been made by a bayonet.

601
00:34:30,092 --> 00:34:30,960
Mathews.

602
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:33,429
Am in your way?

603
00:34:33,827 --> 00:34:35,272
No. I can see over your shoulder.

604
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,061
Mathews, have the men look around.
See if they can find the weapon.

605
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:40,703
There's a whole table full
of knives out in the studio.

606
00:34:41,124 --> 00:34:43,789
You see, they were taking a
picture advertising Cottrell silver.

607
00:34:43,979 --> 00:34:45,566
You can read all about it in my notes.

608
00:34:47,323 --> 00:34:49,110
Here. Take your notes and ..

609
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:50,696
Go and sit down someplace.

610
00:34:51,117 --> 00:34:52,187
Where's the studio?

611
00:34:52,377 --> 00:34:53,447
I will show you.

612
00:34:56,325 --> 00:34:57,631
If you need me just holler.

613
00:34:58,939 --> 00:35:01,262
It took me about thirty minutes
to get here from the house.

614
00:35:01,757 --> 00:35:04,089
Fifteen minutes in the car and
fifteen minutes in the elevator.

615
00:35:05,023 --> 00:35:07,623
When I got here, naturally
I asked for Mrs Fleming.

616
00:35:08,276 --> 00:35:09,778
Miss Taylor went to find her and ..

617
00:35:10,939 --> 00:35:12,444
That's when they discovered it.

618
00:35:12,783 --> 00:35:13,770
What's your name?

619
00:35:15,211 --> 00:35:16,359
Roland X. Smith.

620
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,591
Roland.

621
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:18,680
Smith.

622
00:35:19,043 --> 00:35:21,880
Please. 'X'.
The name is Roland X. Smith.

623
00:35:22,226 --> 00:35:23,284
What is the X for?

624
00:35:23,691 --> 00:35:25,679
To distinguish me from all
the other Roland Smiths.

625
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:32,700
Listen, baby. I want to ask
you a couple of questions.

626
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,214
Okay. Shoot.

627
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,181
Why did you come over
here in the first place?

628
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:41,179
Julie came to the apartment.

629
00:35:41,445 --> 00:35:44,306
After you. She expected
something like this.

630
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:46,409
What's that? I didn't quite catch you.

631
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,427
Get over here on the other side of me.

632
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:55,751
I can talk better over here.

633
00:36:00,152 --> 00:36:03,486
Don't act like a child, Barry. Come over
here and I'll tell you all about it.

634
00:36:05,632 --> 00:36:09,933
Let me see now. I got out of the
Spanish-American war in '99.

635
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:14,450
I was a bartender for 10 years but I had
to give it up. My liver went bad on me.

636
00:36:15,044 --> 00:36:15,942
Who sat here?

637
00:36:16,263 --> 00:36:18,920
No-one sat there. You see, this end
of the table wasn't in the picture.

638
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,696
Oh.

639
00:36:20,231 --> 00:36:21,885
Mrs Fleming sat at the head.

640
00:36:23,053 --> 00:36:24,682
Who sat here on Mrs Fleming's right?

641
00:36:25,193 --> 00:36:27,084
Miss Lawrence sat there originally.
- I see.

642
00:36:27,447 --> 00:36:29,128
She's the woman Mrs Fleming objected to?

643
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:30,239
That's right.

644
00:36:30,491 --> 00:36:32,435
Who took her place?
- Miss Taylor. My assistant.

645
00:36:38,774 --> 00:36:41,366
Look at that table.
Isn't there a piece of cutlery missing?

646
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:44,464
Yes. The carving knife is gone.

647
00:36:45,675 --> 00:36:47,847
Within the easy reach of
anyone who was seated there.

648
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:51,404
Yes. But anyone might have picked it up.
- Let me see that negative again.

649
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:55,141
This picture was taken while
Miss Taylor was seated here, wasn't it?

650
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:55,992
Yes.

651
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,496
Miss Taylor is my ..

652
00:36:57,822 --> 00:36:58,981
It's absurd to think ..

653
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:01,272
No pictures were taken while
Miss Lawrence was here?

654
00:37:01,544 --> 00:37:02,158
No.

655
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:05,157
Have another look.

656
00:37:08,085 --> 00:37:09,673
The knife is missing from the picture.

657
00:37:10,025 --> 00:37:12,643
Therefore, Miss Lawrence could have
been here when the knife disappeared.

658
00:37:13,376 --> 00:37:14,991
Yes, I suppose she could have.

659
00:37:15,414 --> 00:37:17,573
What do you know about this
Lawrence woman, Mr McCormick?

660
00:37:17,934 --> 00:37:20,394
Practically nothing.
We used her on several occasions.

661
00:37:20,684 --> 00:37:23,157
She always seemed to be a rather
mild, quiet, good-natured woman.

662
00:37:23,561 --> 00:37:25,149
You have her address?
- Yes.

663
00:37:25,384 --> 00:37:26,926
I suppose you have some photographs?

664
00:37:27,116 --> 00:37:29,446
Yes. I think we have a model's
directory in the reception room.

665
00:37:29,636 --> 00:37:30,251
Oh.

666
00:37:30,802 --> 00:37:32,052
Let's take a look.

667
00:37:34,664 --> 00:37:35,343
Julie.

668
00:37:36,884 --> 00:37:38,958
Will you help us out please?
Get the Models Directory.

669
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:39,823
Yes.

670
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:42,830
How did you prevail on so prominent
a person as Mrs Fleming ..

671
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,378
To pose for you, Mr McCormick?

672
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,749
She was my wife's aunt.

673
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:46,892
Oh.

674
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:50,088
I may as well tell you that my wife is
the sole heir to the Fleming fortune.

675
00:37:54,222 --> 00:37:56,643
Well, that doesn't necessarily
place you under suspicion.

676
00:37:57,321 --> 00:37:59,603
You seem to have an
up-and-coming business here.

677
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,099
Haven't you?
- I'm on the verge of bankruptcy.

678
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,711
As a matter of fact I
probably will go broke now.

679
00:38:05,388 --> 00:38:06,175
You see ..

680
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:09,412
Mrs Fleming's death is really
a terrible blow to me.

681
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:10,717
How is that?

682
00:38:11,127 --> 00:38:11,901
Well.

683
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:13,628
I was very fond of her.

684
00:38:15,308 --> 00:38:16,495
She was very fond of me.

685
00:38:17,076 --> 00:38:19,062
In fact, she planned to
help me with my troubles.

686
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,509
We had a long chat when
she arrived tonight.

687
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,909
She promised to lend me thirty thousand
dollars to carry on my business.

688
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:27,110
Indeed?

689
00:38:27,853 --> 00:38:29,987
Yes. That is true. I know it's true.

690
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:33,984
Mr McCormick would be stupid to do away
with the person who could save him.

691
00:38:34,174 --> 00:38:35,017
Wouldn't he?

692
00:38:37,689 --> 00:38:40,017
Did you hear Mrs Fleming promise
to lend him the money?

693
00:38:41,648 --> 00:38:42,421
Well ..

694
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:43,902
Not exactly.

695
00:38:44,841 --> 00:38:46,406
You see .. I ..

696
00:38:46,843 --> 00:38:47,658
I told her.

697
00:38:49,101 --> 00:38:50,741
Now I get it.
- Get what?

698
00:38:51,383 --> 00:38:53,533
Why Julie changed her attitude.

699
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,977
You said that after begging you
to have us come over here ..

700
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:59,199
She treated you like a
stepchild when you arrived.

701
00:38:59,457 --> 00:39:00,101
Yeah.

702
00:39:00,656 --> 00:39:01,557
Don't you see?

703
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:04,646
Julie was afraid that it was Mack.

704
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:07,684
Who was going to commit the murder.

705
00:39:11,144 --> 00:39:13,975
That's the new stuff they
use instead of nylon.

706
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,187
Is that so?

707
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:18,693
Then when she found out ..

708
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:21,242
That Mrs 'rich witch' was going
to lend him the money ..

709
00:39:21,432 --> 00:39:24,263
She figured the necessity
for killing her was gone.

710
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:27,579
So she wanted us to forget
about the whole thing.

711
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:29,557
I think you have something there.

712
00:39:30,288 --> 00:39:32,212
You know, that stuff looks nice.

713
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,648
Mrs McCormick.
- Erika.

714
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:39,752
Erika, if there's anything I can do ..

715
00:39:40,074 --> 00:39:41,843
My deepest sympathy.
- Hello, dear.

716
00:39:42,775 --> 00:39:44,401
I tried to get you at the apartment.

717
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:45,889
I was out to dinner.

718
00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:48,875
I want you to meet Inspector Clinton.

719
00:39:51,377 --> 00:39:53,369
Inspector, this is my wife.
- Mrs McCormick.

720
00:39:54,169 --> 00:39:56,623
I'm sorry to meet you under
such unhappy circumstances.

721
00:39:57,537 --> 00:39:58,666
Won't you take a seat?

722
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:01,159
I would like to ask you a few
questions when I can get to you.

723
00:40:06,744 --> 00:40:08,278
Here it is, Inspector.

724
00:40:09,126 --> 00:40:10,390
'Madge Lawrence'.

725
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,470
'Height 5 feet 9'.

726
00:40:13,397 --> 00:40:16,372
'130 pounds. Eyes brown. Hair gray-ish'.

727
00:40:17,156 --> 00:40:19,875
You have Miss Lawrence's address?
- Yes. I have it downstairs in my files.

728
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:22,447
Mind giving it to officer Temple?
- Not at all.

729
00:40:22,856 --> 00:40:25,132
Better take a couple of men with you.
- Alright, Inspector.

730
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:32,156
From 1911 to '13 I went back
to my old job as bartender.

731
00:40:32,686 --> 00:40:34,271
I had to quit. My liver again.

732
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,133
Mrs McCormick.

733
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,451
When was the last time
you saw your aunt?

734
00:40:41,866 --> 00:40:43,324
I had lunch with her yesterday.

735
00:40:43,738 --> 00:40:46,382
Did she give any indication at that
time that she feared for her life?

736
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:49,363
She has never at any time
expressed fears for her life.

737
00:40:49,553 --> 00:40:50,139
Oh.

738
00:40:51,155 --> 00:40:52,170
What's the matter?

739
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,376
I beg your pardon?

740
00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:56,075
I said, what is the matter?

741
00:40:56,696 --> 00:40:57,568
Nothing, sir.

742
00:40:58,484 --> 00:41:00,595
I suppose that was just your
tonsils backfiring, huh?

743
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:01,568
Yes, sir.

744
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:02,689
I mean, no sir.

745
00:41:02,886 --> 00:41:04,425
If you're asking my opinion.

746
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:05,742
Which you're not.

747
00:41:06,158 --> 00:41:08,024
I think he got a little shock from ..

748
00:41:08,494 --> 00:41:09,366
This picture.

749
00:41:09,661 --> 00:41:12,093
Do you know Miss Lawrence?
- Miss Lawrence? No, sir.

750
00:41:12,415 --> 00:41:14,222
Do you know this lady in the picture?

751
00:41:14,753 --> 00:41:15,483
No, sir.

752
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:16,831
Then what startled you?

753
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:19,356
I don't know. I'm a bundle of nerves.

754
00:41:19,782 --> 00:41:22,142
The whole thing is silly.
I'm just imagining things. That's all.

755
00:41:22,437 --> 00:41:24,169
Imagining what? What is silly?

756
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:27,082
I felt I knew the woman in
the picture, but it can't be.

757
00:41:27,272 --> 00:41:28,688
I've not seen her for ten years.

758
00:41:28,878 --> 00:41:31,009
This woman looks younger than
she should after 10 years.

759
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:31,978
Who?

760
00:41:32,168 --> 00:41:33,362
Mrs Fleming, of course.

761
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:35,409
Mrs Fleming?

762
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:37,982
If that's Mrs Fleming,
who's that in there?

763
00:41:38,418 --> 00:41:39,577
The second Mrs Fleming.

764
00:41:41,607 --> 00:41:43,395
And that is the first
Mrs Fleming, isn't it.

765
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,334
Yes.

766
00:41:44,524 --> 00:41:45,868
Then you did recognise her?

767
00:41:46,272 --> 00:41:46,941
Yes.

768
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:47,915
I ..

769
00:41:48,543 --> 00:41:49,415
I don't know.

770
00:41:49,669 --> 00:41:50,716
Of course you do.

771
00:41:50,996 --> 00:41:52,836
A person doesn't change
much in ten years.

772
00:41:53,194 --> 00:41:54,610
Why, I bet you haven't yourself.

773
00:41:55,529 --> 00:41:56,173
Well.

774
00:41:56,753 --> 00:41:58,055
My hair is a little thinner.

775
00:41:58,453 --> 00:42:01,289
Nonsense. I doubt you had more hair when
you worked for the first Mrs Fleming ..

776
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:02,516
Than you have now.

777
00:42:02,817 --> 00:42:04,760
Really, I never worked
for the first Mrs Fleming.

778
00:42:04,975 --> 00:42:06,820
You did know her, didn't you?
- Only by sight.

779
00:42:07,098 --> 00:42:08,886
I saw her at the trial.
- Trial? What trial?

780
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,277
Now, wait a minute. I hate to interrupt
what seems to be a private conversation.

781
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,205
Inspector. Give me a few minutes and
I'll clear this whole thing up for you.

782
00:42:15,425 --> 00:42:16,097
Quiet.

783
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:19,228
Inspector. We're only
trying to help you out.

784
00:42:19,588 --> 00:42:21,756
I realize that and I'm
trying to help you out.

785
00:42:22,229 --> 00:42:23,705
Matthews, open that door.

786
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,794
You mean ..?
- That's exactly what I mean.

787
00:42:28,402 --> 00:42:29,046
Well.

788
00:42:29,928 --> 00:42:32,685
If that's the way you feel about it.
We're only trying to be off assistance.

789
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:36,302
This thing was just beginning
to simplify itself nicely.

790
00:42:36,509 --> 00:42:39,012
Inspector, you're nothing but a silly
self-centered, grumpy old man.

791
00:42:43,696 --> 00:42:44,883
You spoke about a trial.

792
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:46,352
What trial was that?

793
00:42:46,765 --> 00:42:47,552
Inspector.

794
00:42:48,582 --> 00:42:51,597
Roland has been a loyal employee
of my aunt for many years and ..

795
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:54,350
Is obviously reluctant to
drag out family skeletons.

796
00:42:54,998 --> 00:42:56,815
Perhaps I can tell you
what you want to know.

797
00:42:57,014 --> 00:42:57,658
Good.

798
00:43:00,604 --> 00:43:02,029
Is that the first Mrs Fleming?

799
00:43:02,528 --> 00:43:03,525
I wouldn't know.

800
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:07,085
It happened when I was young and most
of it was kept from me for many years.

801
00:43:07,988 --> 00:43:10,805
However, being curious I finally
got to the bottom of it all.

802
00:43:11,894 --> 00:43:14,533
My uncle divorced the first
Mrs Fleming fifteen years ago.

803
00:43:15,149 --> 00:43:17,049
A few months afterwards
he married aunt Isabel.

804
00:43:18,077 --> 00:43:20,704
Later, he died and left his
entire estate to aunt Isabel.

805
00:43:20,894 --> 00:43:24,608
With the exception of $500,000 which
he left to the first Mrs Fleming.

806
00:43:25,614 --> 00:43:27,968
The trial which Roland
spoke of was about the will.

807
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:32,094
My aunt Isabel resented my uncle's
first wife so deeply that ..

808
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:35,441
She declared my uncle insane
in order to break the will.

809
00:43:39,301 --> 00:43:40,984
Are you through questioning me already?

810
00:43:41,442 --> 00:43:42,171
Already?

811
00:43:42,403 --> 00:43:44,468
Not until I learn to write
with my left hand I am.

812
00:43:49,274 --> 00:43:50,003
Hey you.

813
00:43:50,551 --> 00:43:51,459
Wait a minute.

814
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,146
If it isn't machine-gun Gatling.

815
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:55,310
Lieutenant Gatling - my wife.
- How do you do.

816
00:43:55,523 --> 00:43:57,567
What you doing around here?
- Nothing, Lieutenant.

817
00:43:57,757 --> 00:44:00,625
We're just going home.
- Maybe you are and maybe you ain't.

818
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:02,721
Does the inspector know you're around?

819
00:44:03,115 --> 00:44:03,730
Huh?

820
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,587
Yes. Of course. Certainly.

821
00:44:08,556 --> 00:44:10,817
We just left him.
He told us to go on home.

822
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,652
He did, huh?

823
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:14,723
How long have you been around here?

824
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:16,673
Since before the murder, but ..

825
00:44:18,053 --> 00:44:19,990
And the inspector told you to go home?

826
00:44:20,854 --> 00:44:23,073
Before you go, he'll say
he told you to go home.

827
00:44:23,345 --> 00:44:25,250
He'll say alright.
- Come on. We go upstairs.

828
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,142
The inspector won't
like you bringing us.

829
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,635
Don't tell me what he don't like.
I've been with him too long.

830
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,140
You're to stop the whispering too.

831
00:44:36,432 --> 00:44:37,104
Sorry.

832
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,569
How long have you been
running this elevator, Pop?

833
00:44:41,121 --> 00:44:42,585
Well, let me see now.

834
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:44,989
I got out of the Spanish-American
war in 1899 ..

835
00:44:45,305 --> 00:44:46,362
Oh, no you don't.

836
00:44:50,591 --> 00:44:51,421
We'll walk.

837
00:44:52,487 --> 00:44:54,103
The Spanish-American war.

838
00:44:58,109 --> 00:44:58,838
Come on.

839
00:45:01,351 --> 00:45:02,432
Step down please.

840
00:45:15,722 --> 00:45:16,537
Hey, chief.

841
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:18,772
Look who I found trying to
sneak out of the building.

842
00:45:19,246 --> 00:45:20,347
Surprised, ain't you?

843
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:23,259
There ain't anybody sneaking out
on you while I'm around, boss.

844
00:45:23,995 --> 00:45:24,867
[ Telephone ]

845
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:27,356
Now I'm hearing bells ringing.

846
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:28,700
McCormick Studios.

847
00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:31,622
Yes. Just a moment.
It's for you, Inspector Clinton.

848
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:32,799
Huh?

849
00:45:34,506 --> 00:45:35,178
Hello.

850
00:45:36,096 --> 00:45:36,940
Yes, Temple?

851
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,174
Dead?

852
00:45:39,922 --> 00:45:40,828
Are you sure?

853
00:45:41,727 --> 00:45:42,743
Are you sure, Joe?

854
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:45,950
She's either dead or my watch stopped.

855
00:45:46,709 --> 00:45:47,524
Positively.

856
00:45:47,977 --> 00:45:50,080
It looks like she took an
overdose of sleeping tablets.

857
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:53,887
Yes, sir. The place is right around the
corner. You can get here in 5 minutes.

858
00:45:54,215 --> 00:45:55,087
Hey, Charlie.

859
00:45:55,341 --> 00:45:55,985
Look.

860
00:45:56,392 --> 00:45:57,694
Hold on a second, Inspector.

861
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,593
I think Henderson has found something.

862
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:02,103
Yes, sir. We have found
that missing knife.

863
00:46:04,201 --> 00:46:05,159
Good work, boys.

864
00:46:05,456 --> 00:46:06,500
I'll be right over.

865
00:46:08,137 --> 00:46:10,980
Madge Lawrence, the first Mrs Fleming,
murdered Isabel Fleming.

866
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:12,694
And then committed suicide.

00:46:14,504 --> 00:46:16,542
Alright. Thank you all
for your cooperation.

868
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,064
You can all go home now.

00:46:21,581 --> 00:46:22,682
What is it? What now?

871
00:46:22,887 --> 00:46:25,894
What's the matter?
- I left a pot roast in the oven.

872
00:46:38,772 --> 00:46:39,931
There they go. Come on.

873
00:46:40,202 --> 00:46:41,661
The case is closed.

874
00:46:41,889 --> 00:46:44,289
Why go looking for chloroform
cans at this time of the morning?

875
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,513
Because usually the druggist's
name is on the label.

876
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:48,703
I want to find out who bought that can.

877
00:46:50,898 --> 00:46:52,788
Give me a hand. It's slippery.

878
00:46:58,591 --> 00:46:59,490
Help me up.

879
00:46:59,847 --> 00:47:02,013
You stay there, princess.
Where it's safe.

880
00:47:02,706 --> 00:47:03,879

Hello. Hello.

The McCormick Studios.

886
00:49:09,066 --> 00:49:10,854
Darling. You alright?
- Who was it shooting?

887
00:49:11,177 --> 00:49:12,698
I never asked.
Why did you scream?

888
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:14,268
I saw a ghost.
- Nonsense.

889
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:15,902
There's no such things as ghosts.

890
00:49:16,173 --> 00:49:17,930
That's what I thought
until a minute ago.

891
00:49:28,255 --> 00:49:29,325
Turn out the light.

892
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:34,795
Look.
- What's the matter?

893
00:49:35,127 --> 00:49:36,763
It's back again.
- What's back again?

894
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:38,375
The ghost. Back again.

895
00:49:38,565 --> 00:49:39,694
Where? I don't see it.

896
00:49:39,965 --> 00:49:41,066

- Where?

00:49:41,284 --> 00:49:42,300

900
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:50,474
Say something.

901
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:54,831
I got out of the
Spanish-American war in 1899 ..

902
00:49:55,401 --> 00:49:57,776
It's only poor old Pop.
He probably thought we were thieves.

905
00:50:03,053 --> 00:50:04,866
The police.
- Yeah. I called them.

906
00:50:05,188 --> 00:50:07,944
We'd better get out of here before we're
arrested for breaking and entering.

- Morning.

Make sure to get the paper.

Barry, will you put the
garbage out in the hall.

918
00:51:25,045 --> 00:51:26,549
I was just going to.

You don't have to watch me, baby.

00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,242
Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.

921
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,852
Jane. I'll be back in a little while.
I'm going down to police headquarters.

922
00:52:08,255 --> 00:52:09,354
Wait a minute.

923
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:11,074
I can't wait.
I must go right away.

there without me. I want to go too.

925

Now, princess. What do you
want to do, stop traffic?

926
00:52:17,663 --> 00:52:21,081
Now, Jane. You know you can't go out
in the cold right after a hot shower.

927
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:23,206
I won't be gone long.
All I want to do is ..

928
00:52:24,577 --> 00:52:25,859
Gee, you smell good.

929
00:52:26,863 --> 00:52:28,568
So soft and warm.

00:52:29,928 --> 00:52:31,516
Hey, what am I doing? I have to hurry.

931
00:52:34,534 --> 00:52:35,354
I have to.

00:52:35,842 --> 00:52:37,005
Do you, darling?

933
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:39,636
It's murder.

934
00:52:43,642 --> 00:52:45,297
Maybe that will change your mind.

935
00:52:48,214 --> 00:52:51,155
I found that in the back hallway.
Just outside the door of my apartment.

936
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,344
The man listening to
Miss Taylor and my wife ..

937
00:52:53,534 --> 00:52:55,293
Likely dropped it fighting
the housekeeper.

938
00:52:55,632 --> 00:52:56,218
So?

939
00:52:56,618 --> 00:52:59,083
So that proves the eavesdropper
was from the McCormick Studio.

940
00:52:59,398 --> 00:53:00,013
How?

941
00:53:00,356 --> 00:53:02,966
Good heavens, man. It has got
'Prop Room' marked right there on it.

942
00:53:03,156 --> 00:53:05,831
Obviously it's the key to the prop
room of the McCormick Studios.

943
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,983
Does it say McCormick
Studios on the tag?

944
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:08,916
No.

945
00:53:09,288 --> 00:53:11,603
There are hundreds of
property rooms, Mr Craig.

946
00:53:11,866 --> 00:53:13,574
Every theater has a property room.

947
00:53:13,968 --> 00:53:15,840
Every furniture store
has a property room.

948
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:17,827
'Prop room' is quite a common term.

949
00:53:18,017 --> 00:53:19,092
But it all ties up.

950
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,819
Madge Lawrence, or the first
Mrs Fleming as you call her ..

951
00:53:22,009 --> 00:53:23,374
Was not engaged until evening.

952
00:53:23,693 --> 00:53:26,453
Someone tried to chloroform
Julie Taylor in the afternoon.

953
00:53:26,643 --> 00:53:28,608
That same someone followed
her to our apartment.

954
00:53:28,886 --> 00:53:30,159
When she called on my wife.

955
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:31,593
Furthermore, it was a man.

956
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:32,676
Not a woman.

957
00:53:32,945 --> 00:53:34,982
Mrs Swanson glimpsed him
before he knocked her down.

958
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:38,159
Then the first Mrs Fleming couldn't have
murdered the second Mrs Fleming, huh?

959
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:39,247
That's right.

960
00:53:39,437 --> 00:53:41,750
Then why was the knife that
killed the second Mrs Fleming ..

961
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,699
Found in the first
Mrs Fleming's apartment?

962
00:53:43,963 --> 00:53:45,036
Planted.
- Planted?

963
00:53:45,262 --> 00:53:46,358
That's ridiculous.

964
00:53:46,746 --> 00:53:48,577
Nobody left the McCormick Studios.

965
00:53:49,027 --> 00:53:52,765
And yet you say somebody planted that
knife in the Lawrence woman's apartment.

966
00:53:54,623 --> 00:53:55,467
I've got it.

967
00:53:55,804 --> 00:53:57,220
Whoever killed Isabel Fleming ..

968
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:00,803
Put the knife in the first Mrs Fleming's
suitcase before she left the studio.

969
00:54:01,056 --> 00:54:02,587
Probably, she never knew she had it.

970
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:05,392
How did the murderer get her to take
an overdose of sleeping tablets?

971
00:54:05,747 --> 00:54:07,106
Coaxed her over the telephone?

972
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:09,385
Maybe the overdose was an accident.

973
00:54:09,742 --> 00:54:12,576
You yourself said she was in the
habit of taking sleeping tablets.

974
00:54:12,802 --> 00:54:14,692
Yes. And I found out she had a motive.

975
00:54:14,964 --> 00:54:16,437
And I found out she had the knife.

976
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,557
And I found out everybody
else has an alibi.

977
00:54:18,905 --> 00:54:21,295
And I begin to find out that
you're getting to be a pest.

978
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,501
If you pardon me I have some work to do.
- Then you won't reopen the case?

979
00:54:24,773 --> 00:54:27,006
Not on the strength of the
puny evidence you brought up.

980
00:54:27,336 --> 00:54:28,588
Alright, Inspector.

981
00:54:29,554 --> 00:54:31,574
But I'm going to find out
who killed Isabel Fleming.

982
00:54:31,764 --> 00:54:33,814
I'll bet you 5-2 it wasn't
Madge Lawrence.

983
00:54:34,077 --> 00:54:36,994
When you find out Mr Craig, will you let
us know so we can arrest them please?

984
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,149
Will you answer me just one question?

985
00:54:40,481 --> 00:54:41,801
We aim to please.

986
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:46,100
Did you check to see if the Lawrence
woman's fingerprints were on that knife?

987
00:54:51,776 --> 00:54:52,420
Okay.

988
00:54:56,142 --> 00:54:57,202
Imagine that cluck.

989
00:54:57,494 --> 00:55:00,525
Of course you checked if the Lawrence
dame's fingerprints were on the knife.

990
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:01,906
Didn't you, chief?

991
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:03,699
Sure. I knew you did.

992
00:55:06,007 --> 00:55:08,304
And her fingerprints
were not on the knife.

993
00:55:09,425 --> 00:55:10,109
Huh?

994
00:55:14,491 --> 00:55:15,764
Hello, Lewis.
- Hi, Craig.

995
00:55:18,328 --> 00:55:19,873
Hey, Mr Craig. Wait a minute.

996
00:55:20,412 --> 00:55:21,084
Barry.

997
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:24,235
How about a story on the Fleming case?
- Stand aside. Let me get this picture.

998
00:55:24,543 --> 00:55:25,931
Have you any theories, Barry?

999
00:55:26,332 --> 00:55:27,988
Yes, of course. Quite a few.

1000
00:55:28,303 --> 00:55:29,547
Go ahead. Let's hear them.

1001
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:32,281
It's my opinion that the death
of the first Mrs Fleming ..

1002
00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:34,470
Had nothing to do with
the murder of the second.

1003
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,675
What do you mean?

1004
00:55:35,991 --> 00:55:39,226
I mean, I believe the murderer of
Isabel Fleming is still at large.

1005
00:55:39,584 --> 00:55:40,660
Still at large?

1006
00:56:23,312 --> 00:56:25,300
Put it right on top, son.
Give him the money, dear.

1007
00:56:28,191 --> 00:56:30,412
My name is headlined in
every newspaper in the city.

1008
00:56:30,618 --> 00:56:32,665
Princess, you're married
to a very famous man.

1009
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,961
Yes. And so modest.
- I can afford to be.

1010
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:39,253
I wouldn't be surprised to find newsreel
cameramen inside to take pictures of me.

1011
00:56:43,324 --> 00:56:45,360
Barry. I think the lock
has been tampered with.

1012
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:46,989
Don't be silly.

1013
00:57:02,387 --> 00:57:03,591
Oh, Barry.

1014
00:57:04,824 --> 00:57:06,480
Let me go.
- Let her go.

1015
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:08,192
Honey.

1016
00:57:09,939 --> 00:57:10,583
What?

1017
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,224
What's this all about?

1018
00:57:12,684 --> 00:57:14,136
Who are these guys?

1019
00:57:14,383 --> 00:57:16,978
I don't think they're the
newsreel cameramen.

1020
00:57:17,203 --> 00:57:18,419
Here. Let me help you up.

1021
00:57:20,974 --> 00:57:21,990
Now look, fathead.

1022
00:57:22,864 --> 00:57:25,304
You've been running off at the
mouth all day about what you think.

1023
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,007
And what you suspect. You know?

1024
00:57:27,899 --> 00:57:30,943
If you want to stay healthy, keep your
mouth shut and mind your own business.

1025
00:57:31,183 --> 00:57:31,941
You know?

1026
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:34,326
Don't get any more ideas
about the Fleming case.

1027
00:57:34,605 --> 00:57:37,924
Or you'll wind up in the headlines again
but you won't be able to read them.

1028
00:57:38,249 --> 00:57:40,040
You know?
- Whoever hired you must be ..

1029
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,143
Whoever hired me told
me to give you this.

1030
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:45,648
Darling.

1031
00:57:48,253 --> 00:57:50,629
When he wakes up, you'd better
remind him what's good for him.

1032
00:57:51,487 --> 00:57:52,300
You know?

1033
00:58:01,382 --> 00:58:02,528
I'll get you a drink.

1034
00:58:08,793 --> 00:58:09,751
Here. Take this.

1035
00:58:11,702 --> 00:58:12,603
Wait a minute.

1036
00:58:12,793 --> 00:58:15,123
I'm the one who got hit.
- Sorry. I'm all confused.

1037
00:58:15,751 --> 00:58:17,181
He pulled a Sunday punch on me.

1038
00:58:17,371 --> 00:58:19,843
He'd never have got away with it
if he hadn't pulled a Sunday punch.

1039
00:58:20,033 --> 00:58:21,276
You know what this proves?

1040
00:58:21,734 --> 00:58:24,358
Madge Lawrence's suicide had nothing
to do with Isabel Fleming's death.

1041
00:58:24,746 --> 00:58:27,854
Right. Her death just happened to
work in favor of the real killer.

1042
00:58:28,764 --> 00:58:30,792
You know, my theory was
that Madge Lawrence ..

1043
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,805
Overdosed on sleeping tablets. You know.

1044
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:34,847
Maybe accidentally. Maybe on purpose.

1045
00:58:35,073 --> 00:58:36,705
But her only part in the case was ..

1046
00:58:36,895 --> 00:58:39,005
That the murderer planted
the knife in her bag ..

1047
00:58:39,195 --> 00:58:41,536
Knowing her true identity would
come out and she'd be blamed.

1048
00:58:41,989 --> 00:58:44,601
But darling, I know that.
You've bent my ear all day telling me.

1049
00:58:45,219 --> 00:58:48,421
Can't you see it's true? That's why the
killer got hoodlums to scare me off.

1050
00:58:48,877 --> 00:58:50,680
I'm getting hot on the trail, you know.

1051
00:58:50,973 --> 00:58:53,188
And if you don't watch out you
will cool off in the morgue.

1052
00:58:53,378 --> 00:58:55,122
Not me. I know how to
take care of myself.

1053
00:58:55,312 --> 00:58:58,325
Sure you do. I bet you broke that
hoodlum's fist with your jaw.

1054
00:58:58,532 --> 00:59:01,606
Oh? So a guy gets knocked down and
you lose all your confidence in him?

1055
00:59:02,077 --> 00:59:04,151
Now Barry, I didn't mean it that way.

1056
00:59:04,608 --> 00:59:06,453
I have all the confidence
in the world in you.

1057
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:08,672
That's why I want you to
go on with this thing.

1058
00:59:09,315 --> 00:59:11,206
You will get closer and closer ..

1059
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:13,515
First thing you know, you'll get killed.

1060
00:59:13,705 --> 00:59:15,886
This is dangerous business, Barry.
Drop it.

1061
00:59:16,106 --> 00:59:17,978
Are you suggesting that
I behave like a coward?

1062
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:20,071
I'm just suggesting you behave.

1063
00:59:21,271 --> 00:59:23,576
Listen, princess.
Someday, we hope to have a child.

1064
00:59:23,779 --> 00:59:26,849
And I don't want the child to grow up to
point the finger of shame at its father.

1065
00:59:27,122 --> 00:59:29,040
Then we'll teach him not to point.

1066
00:59:30,131 --> 00:59:33,117
No use trying to kid me out of it, Jane.
My job is to get to the bottom of this.

1067
00:59:33,307 --> 00:59:35,576
To the bottom alright.
Of the east river.

1068
00:59:36,214 --> 00:59:37,058
Look, honey.

1069
00:59:37,248 --> 00:59:40,292
I'm just going over to the McCormick
Studios to have a look around.

1070
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,912
I want you to stay here.

1071
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:43,131
Don't be silly.

1072
00:59:43,891 --> 00:59:47,465
After all, if I end up as a widow
I've a right to see how it's done.

1073
00:59:48,198 --> 00:59:48,985
[ Buzzer ]

1074
00:59:49,584 --> 00:59:51,342
Who do you suppose that is?
- I don't know.

1075
00:59:51,532 --> 00:59:53,704
But this time they're not going
to pull a Sunday on me.

1076
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:56,858
Whoever it is, is going to
have to fight fair and square.

1077
01:00:02,246 --> 01:00:03,632
Good evening, Mr Smith.

1078
01:00:04,075 --> 01:00:05,692
Have a seat.
- Thank you.

1079
01:00:05,882 --> 01:00:06,964
Sit down, Mr Smith.

1080
01:00:07,265 --> 01:00:09,739
Would you care for a little sherry?

1081
01:00:10,059 --> 01:00:12,228
Thank you, no. I believe not.
- You're sure?

1082
01:00:12,661 --> 01:00:15,551
On second thoughts I think I will.
I need something to quiet my nerves.

1083
01:00:15,741 --> 01:00:16,842
Let me take your hat.

1084
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,332
I feel like I've been
run through a ringer.

1085
01:00:20,522 --> 01:00:21,623
What's bothering you?

1086
01:00:22,383 --> 01:00:24,450
Your theory in the papers. Thank you.

1087
01:00:25,533 --> 01:00:27,579
Ever since I read it I have
been on needles and pins.

1088
01:00:27,949 --> 01:00:29,308
I just didn't know what to do.

1089
01:00:29,601 --> 01:00:32,859
First I felt I'd have a talk with you.
Then I thought I mustn't talk with you.

1090
01:00:33,078 --> 01:00:35,753
Then I said Yes to myself.
Then I said No to myself.

1091
01:00:36,324 --> 01:00:37,873
I'm all worn out from the argument.

1092
01:00:38,063 --> 01:00:40,065
I know exactly how you feel.

1093
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,146
Thank you.

1094
01:00:41,336 --> 01:00:43,554
Now you're here, old man.
What's on your mind?

1095
01:00:44,456 --> 01:00:45,325
Lee Kenyon.

1096
01:00:46,006 --> 01:00:47,598
Lee Kenyon?
- Yes, darling.

1097
01:00:47,805 --> 01:00:51,995
He's a model who works in the nightclub
where you read the sign walking by.

1098
01:00:52,866 --> 01:00:53,671
Oh yes.

1099
01:00:54,386 --> 01:00:55,683
What about him, Mr Smith?

1100
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:56,907
Just this.

1101
01:00:57,422 --> 01:00:59,311
Two days before Mrs Fleming was ..

1102
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:01,653
Before she passed away.

1103
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:05,408
This Kenyon person came to the house.
I don't know if it was by appointment.

1104
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:07,111
But just before he arrived ..

1105
01:01:07,301 --> 01:01:10,629
Mrs Fleming sent me to the bank and
had me draw out $10,000 in cash.

1106
01:01:11,724 --> 01:01:14,050
I thought it was extraordinary too.
But that isn't all.

1107
01:01:14,645 --> 01:01:18,170
This morning, I checked Mrs Fleming's
effects and the $10,000 is gone.

1108
01:01:21,012 --> 01:01:23,566
I'd better run down to that nightclub
and have a talk with Kenyon.

1109
01:01:23,772 --> 01:01:25,849
My car is outside. I'd be
very glad to run you over.

1110
01:01:26,072 --> 01:01:27,867
That's so sweet of you, Mr Smith.

1111
01:01:28,123 --> 01:01:30,983
You only have a small coupé,
haven't you Mr Smith?

1112
01:01:31,406 --> 01:01:33,235
Oh no. I have a large sedan.

1113
01:01:35,493 --> 01:01:36,778
That's what I said.

1114
01:01:45,163 --> 01:01:46,537
Good evening, Mr Craig.

1115
01:01:48,616 --> 01:01:49,948
Good evening, Mr Craig.

1116
01:01:50,453 --> 01:01:52,546
Good evening, Mr Craig.
This way, Mr Craig.

1117
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:54,256
So, you just walked by the place?

1118
01:01:54,475 --> 01:01:56,491
They probably saw my
picture in the paper.

1119
01:01:58,597 --> 01:02:00,864
I told you not to take that last drink.

1120

[ Door knocks ]

1121
01:02:06,344 --> 01:02:07,169
Come in.

1122
01:02:08,459 --> 01:02:09,994
A friend to see you, Mr Kenyon.

1123
01:02:11,153 --> 01:02:12,561
Oh. Mr Craig.

01:02:12,994 --> 01:02:14,867
Come in. Have a seat.
- Thank you.

1125
01:02:17,326 --> 01:02:20,364
Doesn't this left shoulder
look a little too padded?

1126
01:02:20,677 --> 01:02:23,255
Not at all. A beautiful suit. New?
- Yes.

1127
01:02:24,276 --> 01:02:27,126
Now, Mr Craig. I have been reading
about you in the paper today.

1128
01:02:27,382 --> 01:02:29,011
Oh?
- What can I do for you?

1129
01:02:29,502 --> 01:02:30,873
Do for me?
- Yeah.

1130
01:02:31,297 --> 01:02:34,342
I'm not egotistical enough to think
you came here just to see me dance.

1131
01:02:34,655 --> 01:02:35,357
I see.

1132
01:02:35,576 --> 01:02:37,768
Whatever questions you
want to ask me, go ahead.

1133
01:02:38,324 --> 01:02:40,363
I'll try to answer them if I can.

1134
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:42,834
Alright. Who is your tailor?

1135
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:45,728
Max Morris.

1136
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:48,212
Oh. Forgive me for even
asking that question.

1137
01:02:48,402 --> 01:02:50,624
He charges about $200 for
a suit of clothes, doesn't he?

1138
01:02:50,904 --> 01:02:51,725
Yes.

1139
01:02:52,302 --> 01:02:53,900
Yes. He is rather high, but ..

1140
01:02:54,286 --> 01:02:57,046
A man has to wear well-tailored
clothes when he's before the public.

1141
01:02:57,301 --> 01:03:01,572
Of course. Besides, what's two hundred
dollars to a man who has ten thousand?

1142
01:03:05,158 --> 01:03:06,969
Ten thousand dollars? Me?

1143
01:03:07,407 --> 01:03:09,142
Ten thousand? Why ..

1144
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:12,426
Where would a guy like me
get ten thousand dollars?

1145
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:19,140
From the late Mrs Isabel Fleming?

1146
01:03:24,831 --> 01:03:27,372
Look, Mr Craig. You can't get
me mixed up in this thing.

1147
01:03:27,822 --> 01:03:29,740
I don't know anything about it.
I swear I don't.

1148
01:03:31,077 --> 01:03:33,515
I admit I got ten thousand
dollars from the old lady.

1149
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:35,562
But I had nothing to do
with knocking her off.

1150
01:03:35,752 --> 01:03:37,143
Maybe. Maybe not.

1151
01:03:37,685 --> 01:03:40,986
But you're not telling me she gave you
that money just because she liked you?

1152
01:03:41,342 --> 01:03:41,995
No.

1153
01:03:43,579 --> 01:03:44,880
No. Of course not.

1154
01:03:47,348 --> 01:03:49,347
She gave me the money
to stay away from Erika.

1155
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,312
From Mrs McCormick?

1156
01:03:51,542 --> 01:03:52,187
Yeah.

1157
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:56,211
You see, Erika told her she was going to
divorce Mack and marry somebody else.

1158
01:03:57,014 --> 01:03:58,423
The old lady thought it was me.

1159
01:03:59,155 --> 01:04:02,128
So she called me up there and offered
me ten grand to stay away from Erika.

1160
01:04:02,528 --> 01:04:03,830
Naturally, I took the money.

1161
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,816
Well. I thought it was a
good joke on the old lady.

1162
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:09,926
Especially since I hadn't
seen Erika in over a year.

1163
01:04:10,515 --> 01:04:13,023
You mean, you <i>weren't</i> the
man Erika was in love with?

1164
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:14,363
Certainly not.

1165
01:04:14,662 --> 01:04:17,544
Erika and I used to be good friends
but that's all it amounted to.

1166
01:04:19,543 --> 01:04:21,214
Where did you meet her? Through Mack?

1167
01:04:21,598 --> 01:04:23,097
No. I knew her before Mack did.

1168
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:24,978
Harry Duerr introduced us.

1169
01:04:25,215 --> 01:04:27,348
As a matter of fact, Duerr
introduced Mack to her.

1170
01:04:28,057 --> 01:04:30,318
She and Duerr were kids together.

1171
01:05:05,007 --> 01:05:06,162
Having a good time?

1172
01:05:06,758 --> 01:05:07,610
I was.

1173
01:05:07,986 --> 01:05:10,954
Is that all you came down here for?
Just to have a good time?

1174
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:12,285
What else?

1175
01:05:12,553 --> 01:05:13,805
Where is your boyfriend?

1176
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,827
I was just wondering about that myself.

1177
01:05:17,543 --> 01:05:19,923
He must have wandered
away somewhere, I guess.

1178
01:05:20,723 --> 01:05:22,861
But he'll come back. He always does.

1179
01:05:23,777 --> 01:05:24,714
That's swell.

1180
01:05:24,977 --> 01:05:27,564
We'll hang around and have another
little chat with him. You know?

1181
01:05:27,853 --> 01:05:31,062
You don't have to. He made up his mind
to keep his nose out of the whole thing.

1182
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:32,896
Good, We will wait.

1183
01:05:33,261 --> 01:05:35,573
And congratulate him on using his brain.

1184
01:05:36,695 --> 01:05:37,467
Alright.

1185
01:05:38,275 --> 01:05:39,495
Suit yourself.

1186
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:43,740
Do you mind if I leave you for
a minute to powder my nose?

1187
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:46,960
Wait a minute. You don't want to
get this coat covered with powder.

1188
01:05:47,289 --> 01:05:48,880
You know. Leave it here.

1189
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:50,633
It will be here when you get back.

1190
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:54,384
Very well. But keep a good eye on it.

1191
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:56,164
I just got it.

1192
01:06:05,055 --> 01:06:05,797

1193
01:06:06,292 --> 01:06:07,650
What is it? What's the matter?

1194
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,114
Barry. Those two hoodlums.
They're waiting out front for you.

1195
01:06:12,023 --> 01:06:14,861
Kenyon, is there any way out of here
without going back through the café?

1196
01:06:15,277 --> 01:06:16,974
There's a fire door in the chorus room.

1197
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:18,914
But the girls are making a change.

1198
01:06:19,131 --> 01:06:20,435
Oh? Come on.

1199
01:06:20,856 --> 01:06:23,962
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Blindfold yourself, dear.

1200
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:25,586
I'll see if it's alright.

1201
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:26,927
Girls.

1202
01:06:27,661 --> 01:06:28,448
Come in.

1203
01:06:29,242 --> 01:06:31,466
Listen, girls. I'd like to bring
a gentleman through here.

1204
01:06:33,275 --> 01:06:36,382
But it's a matter of life and death
and besides, he'll be blindfolded.

1205
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,374
Okay. Bring him through.

1206
01:06:45,449 --> 01:06:47,000
Thanks for everything, girls.

1207
01:06:47,261 --> 01:06:48,473
Why, it's Mr Craig.

1208
01:06:48,987 --> 01:06:50,223
Hello, Mr Craig.

1209
01:06:51,355 --> 01:06:52,783
They must know me from my books.

1210
01:06:53,062 --> 01:06:54,704
Don't tell me they can read too.

1211
01:07:07,009 --> 01:07:07,803
Phillip.

1212
01:07:08,216 --> 01:07:10,398
Here is the money for our drinks.
- Thank you, sir.

01:07:10,933 --> 01:07:11,795

1214
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:30,437
Next time, they will know better.

1215
01:07:31,496 --> 01:07:32,610
You know?

1216
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,583
What did you find out from Kenyon?
- I'll tell you on the way to Julie's.

1217
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:41,451
Taxi.

1218
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:43,314
What can we find out from Julie?
- Taxi.

1219
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:45,943
You thought she was in love with Mack?
- Yes.

1220
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,114
Well, when a dame is
in love with a guy ..

1221
01:07:48,304 --> 01:07:51,059
It's only natural for her to know
who the guy's wife is in love with.

1222
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:52,047
Hey. Taxi.

1223
01:07:57,255 --> 01:08:00,300
We'd like to see Julie Taylor please.
Just tell her it's Mr and Mrs Craig.

1224
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:03,270
I am sorry. Miss Taylor checked
out about fifteen minutes ago.

1225
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,418
Checked out at this time of night?
Where'd she go?

1226
01:08:05,608 --> 01:08:07,784
I don't know, sir. She didn't
leave a forwarding address.

1227
01:08:09,324 --> 01:08:10,253
That's strange.

1228
01:08:10,443 --> 01:08:12,172
Yes it is.
After being here for two years.

1229
01:08:12,362 --> 01:08:14,519
I asked her about her mail
and she didn't answer at all.

1230
01:08:14,878 --> 01:08:16,283
She just rushed right on by.

1231
01:08:18,696 --> 01:08:19,683
Thanks very much.

No.

- No.

No.

Yes. He is here. Who is calling?

This is Erika McCormick.

Mr Craig, you've got to help me.

1252
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:13,092
I just found out something.

Now what?

1258
01:09:20,937 --> 01:09:22,696
I'll go over there to
have a talk with her.

1259
01:09:22,961 --> 01:09:24,835
Maybe she'll ring again.
Why not call her back?

1260
01:09:25,108 --> 01:09:26,980
I've a hunch something's
happening over there.

1261
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:29,304
Whatever it is, I hope it
happens before we get there.

1262
01:09:29,961 --> 01:09:31,781
Hey, give us a line on this, will you?

1263
01:09:32,038 --> 01:09:35,169
It was the McCormick dame, wasn't it?
- When can Inspector Clinton talk to us?

you guys, he'll talk to you guys.

How about talking to
Henderson or Gatling then?

1266
01:09:40,856 --> 01:09:42,786
Nobody gets inside. Do you understand?

1267
01:09:45,429 --> 01:09:47,738
Did you tell the boys to come up?
- I sure did, Doc.

1268
01:09:47,928 --> 01:09:49,201
What did you find out, Doc?

1269
01:09:50,214 --> 01:09:51,458
She was strangled alright.

1270
01:09:52,281 --> 01:09:54,957
We may find out more with
an autopsy but I doubt it.

1271
01:09:57,202 --> 01:09:59,640
Do you feel like answering a
few questions, Mr McCormick?

1272
01:10:01,312 --> 01:10:03,443
If I didn't, I'd have to answer
them anyway, wouldn't I?

1273
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,360
No. Not necessarily.

1274
01:10:05,976 --> 01:10:07,111
Still, it might help.

1275
01:10:07,843 --> 01:10:08,601
Go ahead.

01:10:11,176 --> 01:10:13,696
How long were you here before
you telephoned headquarters?

1277
01:10:14,051 --> 01:10:15,639
I told you before. I had just arrived.

1278
01:10:17,084 --> 01:10:18,679
I went into the bedroom and found ..

1279
01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:22,134
I found her and I called
you immediately.

1280
01:10:23,592 --> 01:10:24,808
You were out all evening?

1281
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:27,699
Yeah. I was at the studio
working on the books.

1282
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:32,662
I suppose you can supply witnesses
to corroborate your statement?

1283
01:10:32,884 --> 01:10:33,842
I'm afraid not.

1284
01:10:34,622 --> 01:10:36,462
Unless the elevator man
happened to see me.

1285
01:10:36,729 --> 01:10:38,618
No. Unfortunately for you he didn't.

1286
01:10:39,062 --> 01:10:40,448
We've already checked with him.

1287
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:43,839
Alright. If you think I did it, why
not arrest me and have it over with?

1288
01:10:45,178 --> 01:10:48,380
You seem more concerned with your own
predicament than with your wife's death.

1289
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:51,440
You were on friendly terms, I suppose?

1290
01:10:52,151 --> 01:10:52,852
Well ..

1291
01:10:54,614 --> 01:10:56,964
I may as well tell you.
You will find out anyway.

1292
01:10:57,958 --> 01:10:59,574
This afternoon my wife told me that ..

1293
01:11:00,849 --> 01:11:02,151
She was going to divorce me.

Hey. There's one here that isn't a bill.

01:11:43,516 --> 01:11:44,932

01:11:47,406 --> 01:11:48,249
'Dear Jane'.

1306
01:11:48,439 --> 01:11:51,390
'I suppose it's cowardly for me to run
away but I can't bear to hang around ..'

1307
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:54,131
'And see the grandest person
I've ever known suffer'.

1308
01:11:54,754 --> 01:11:57,248
'Yes. You guessed it from the start.
I love Mack McCormick'.

1309
01:11:57,895 --> 01:12:00,928
'But he doesn't know I'm alive.
However, I want to help him if I can'.

1310
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:02,996
'That's why I am writing to you, Jane'.

1311
01:12:03,186 --> 01:12:05,513
'He's in so much trouble
and the reopening of this ..'

1312
01:12:05,911 --> 01:12:08,407
'Case will just make it more
difficult for him, so ..'

1313
01:12:08,836 --> 01:12:11,121
'Won't you please ask Barry
to let the matter drop'.

1314
01:12:11,541 --> 01:12:14,100
'I am sure the police have the proper
solution to Mrs Fleming's death'.

1315
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:15,820
'There's no need to ask questions'.

1316
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,714
'They only bring out a lot of
gossip and unpleasantness'.

1317
01:12:18,904 --> 01:12:20,405
'Please Jane. Devotedly, Julia'.

1318
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:23,372
'P.S'.

1319
01:12:23,562 --> 01:12:25,567
'I just called Mack at the studio'.

1320
01:12:25,783 --> 01:12:28,084
'If only you could
have heard his voice'.

1321
01:12:28,274 --> 01:12:30,036
'So tired and unhappy'.

1322
01:12:31,005 --> 01:12:32,075

New York Central stationery.

1324
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,732
Evidently, she wrote the
letter at the railroad station.

1325
01:12:38,003 --> 01:12:39,189
Let me see the envelope.

1326
01:12:39,848 --> 01:12:41,645
Picked up at .. 1am.

1327
01:12:42,396 --> 01:12:44,231
She obviously thinks Mack did it.

1328
01:12:44,688 --> 01:12:45,332
Uhuh.

1329
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:47,731
Running away to keep
from being questioned.

1330
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:50,218
She probably doesn't even
know about Erika's death.

1331
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:52,252
Barry, Mack was at the studio.

1332
01:12:52,509 --> 01:12:53,689
She followed him there.

1333
01:12:54,344 --> 01:12:55,493
I wonder at what time.

1334
01:12:56,595 --> 01:12:58,375
Where is my hat?
- Here we go again.

1335
01:13:04,032 --> 01:13:05,105
Show him the letter.

1336
01:13:07,811 --> 01:13:09,427
When did you get this?
- This morning.

1337
01:13:09,617 --> 01:13:11,424
Why didn't you tell the
police Julie called?

1338
01:13:11,614 --> 01:13:13,283
That would prove you were at the studio.

1339
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:15,434
I dragged her into this.
- What time did she call?

1340
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:17,388
What time did she call?

1341
01:13:17,855 --> 01:13:19,160
About a quarter past twelve.

1342
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:20,929
That's when Erika phoned you.

1343
01:13:21,209 --> 01:13:23,312
And she was killed right then
to keep her from talking.

1344
01:13:23,546 --> 01:13:24,875
That proves you didn't do it.

1345
01:13:25,065 --> 01:13:26,467
Erika called you? What is that?

1346
01:13:26,657 --> 01:13:28,368
Mack. We've no time to answer questions.

1347
01:13:28,558 --> 01:13:30,346
We have time to ask one.
Will you answer it?

1348
01:13:30,612 --> 01:13:31,370
If I can.

1349
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,598
Who engaged Madge Lawrence
to pose for the picture?

1350
01:13:33,821 --> 01:13:35,323
I don't know. But Julie would know.

1351
01:13:36,171 --> 01:13:37,616
And we don't know where Julie is.

1352
01:13:38,308 --> 01:13:40,200

01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:43,642
Come on, princess.

1355
01:13:43,832 --> 01:13:45,259
You wait here until we get back.

1356
01:13:45,469 --> 01:13:46,618
Don't worry. I will.

1357
01:13:59,003 --> 01:13:59,873
What now?

1358
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,765
Listen, baby. You used to be an actress.

1359
01:14:01,955 --> 01:14:04,172
Do you think you could sound
like Julie over the telephone?

1360
01:14:04,448 --> 01:14:05,768
Why .. I don't know.

1361
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:07,488
Make up your mind. Yes or no?

1362
01:14:08,408 --> 01:14:09,052
Well.

1363
01:14:10,221 --> 01:14:11,407
Maybe.
- Good. Come on.

1364
01:14:11,597 --> 01:14:13,827
Oh Barry. Whatever you're
figuring on doing ..

1365
01:14:14,153 --> 01:14:15,411
I don't like it.

1366
01:14:23,753 --> 01:14:24,606
Hello, boys.

1367
01:14:27,236 --> 01:14:28,138
Hello Craig.

1368
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,257
Just what do you want around here?

1369
01:14:31,524 --> 01:14:33,916
I just wondered if you had seen Julie.
- No.

1370
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,440
She checked out of her
apartment last night.

1371
01:14:36,793 --> 01:14:38,750
You know that.
- Yes. But how do you know?

1372
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:40,816
We called her apartment
house this morning.

1373
01:14:41,555 --> 01:14:43,822
The clerk said you'd been round
looking for her last night.

1374
01:14:44,029 --> 01:14:46,795
Or rather he said, a nosy guy
with a good-looking woman.

1375
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:48,174
Sounds like you.

1376
01:14:48,364 --> 01:14:49,350
Did you find her?

1377
01:14:49,979 --> 01:14:53,002
No. But my wife received a
letter from her this morning.

1378
01:14:53,309 --> 01:14:54,410
I have it right here.

1379
01:14:57,667 --> 01:14:59,758
What did I do with that letter?
I must have lost it.

1380
01:14:59,976 --> 01:15:01,135
Yeah. I'll bet you did.

1381
01:15:01,555 --> 01:15:03,922
Here's the envelope.
You can see it was mailed last night.

1382
01:15:05,089 --> 01:15:07,248
What do you want around here, Craig?
What are you after?

1383
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:08,394
Oh, I was ..

1384
01:15:08,764 --> 01:15:10,850
Just trying to find out who killed ..

1385
01:15:11,177 --> 01:15:12,934
Isabel Fleming and Erika McCormick.

1386
01:15:13,304 --> 01:15:14,548
I think Julie can tell me.

1387
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:17,214
Alright. So why don't you go
and find her and ask her?

1388
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,784
I know where she is or
I will in a few minutes.

1389
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,789
She'll phone me here at .. ten o'clock.

1390
01:15:24,649 --> 01:15:25,693
You see, gentlemen.

1391
01:15:26,311 --> 01:15:28,820
There are only four people
who could possibly be guilty.

1392
01:15:29,421 --> 01:15:30,860
Mack. Kenyon.

1393
01:15:32,182 --> 01:15:32,816
You.

1394
01:15:34,779 --> 01:15:35,523
And you.

1395
01:15:37,386 --> 01:15:39,981
Whoever it was planned Isabel
Fleming's murder beautifully.

1396
01:15:40,171 --> 01:15:42,278
The aim of the murder was
to get the Fleming fortune ..

1397
01:15:42,468 --> 01:15:44,004
Into the hands of Erika McCormick.

1398
01:15:45,104 --> 01:15:46,818
According to that reasoning it was Mack.

1399
01:15:47,008 --> 01:15:48,595
He's the only one who'd profit by it.

1400
01:15:48,895 --> 01:15:50,888
Mack was terribly hard up I know, but ..

1401
01:15:51,137 --> 01:15:52,381
I don't believe he did it.

1402
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:56,055
No. Mack wouldn't profit by it. You see,
Erika had already applied for a divorce.

1403
01:15:56,317 --> 01:15:57,790
I didn't know that.
- Didn't you?

1404
01:15:58,438 --> 01:16:00,382
Well, Erika was in love
with another man.

1405
01:16:00,761 --> 01:16:02,908
That man wanted her to
get the Fleming fortune.

1406
01:16:03,324 --> 01:16:04,483
Before he married her.

1407
01:16:04,829 --> 01:16:06,851
And .. that man is the murderer.

1408
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:10,886
Somehow Erika found out he was the
murderer so he had to kill her too.

1409
01:16:11,326 --> 01:16:12,584
Now, let's take Kenyon.

1410
01:16:13,504 --> 01:16:14,946
Whoever killed Isabel Fleming ..

1411
01:16:15,207 --> 01:16:18,463
Hired Madge Lawrence knowing the story
of the family feud would come out ..

1412
01:16:18,653 --> 01:16:19,873
And she would be blamed.

1413
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:23,588
Kenyon, who was only another model,
could not possibly have hired Madge.

1414
01:16:25,497 --> 01:16:26,398
That leaves ..

1415
01:16:26,753 --> 01:16:27,625
Just you two.

1416
01:16:28,952 --> 01:16:30,147
Jabber, jabber, jabber.

1417
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:33,030
When Julie telephones ..

1418
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:35,672
She will tell me which of
you employed Madge.

1419
01:16:35,984 --> 01:16:37,228
That's all I have to know.

1420
01:16:37,418 --> 01:16:38,701
Why don't you go away?

1421
01:16:44,165 --> 01:16:46,072
How do you account for Lawrence's death?

1422
01:16:46,873 --> 01:16:48,395
Oh. An accident.

1423
01:16:48,984 --> 01:16:51,543
She was nervous over the scene
she had with Isabel Fleming ..

1424
01:16:51,733 --> 01:16:53,435
And took an overdose
of sleeping tablets.

1425
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:55,376
But the knife?

1426
01:16:55,787 --> 01:16:57,859
It was planted in her bag
before she left the studio.

1427
01:16:58,504 --> 01:16:59,491
Very interesting.

1428
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:02,667
Yeah. It sounds like another
one of your corny books.

Kirk, is Barry Craig there?

1436
01:17:16,724 --> 01:17:17,982
Yes. He's right here.

Julie, I want you to answer
me just one question.

1440
01:17:26,373 --> 01:17:27,303
Now think hard.

1441
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:29,875
Who was it that engaged Madge Lawrence?

1442
01:17:31,362 --> 01:17:32,022
Who?

1443
01:17:33,378 --> 01:17:33,996
Who?

01:17:34,186 --> 01:17:35,289
Is that really Julie?

1445
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:36,724
No. It's Craig's wife.

1446
01:17:38,064 --> 01:17:39,223
Alright, boys. You win.

1447
01:17:40,668 --> 01:17:41,970
It's no use. It didn't work.

1448
01:17:43,053 --> 01:17:43,729
Okay.

1449
01:17:44,048 --> 01:17:44,777
Goodbye.

Well .. I tried.

01:17:48,767 --> 01:17:50,421
And a good try it was too.

01:17:51,001 --> 01:17:52,388
But I warn you about one thing.

We can help Mack if you'll
tell me just one thing.

Now turn around. Both of you.

had since I've been on this case.
