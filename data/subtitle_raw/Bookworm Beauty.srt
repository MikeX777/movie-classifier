1
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,083
<i>Once upon a time,
there was a very well-behaved girl.</i>

2
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,583
<i>The Buddha appeared</i>

3
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:44,000
<i>and gave her a magic book.</i>

4
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,083
<i>When you grow up…</i>

5
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:53,833
<i>The book will give
you the most magical things.</i>

6
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:10,833
Miss Idol, An!

7
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:14,083
Miss Idol, An!

8
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,541
I want to leave the contest.

9
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,000
THREE MONTHS AGO

10
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,000
<i>This is me.</i>

11
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:33,208
<i>At this time, my only dream
is to get into Harvard University.</i>

12
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:37,458
<i>So of course, the only thing
I need to do is to focus on learning.</i>

13
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,000
<i>However, life is not that simple.</i>

14
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,000
JA JA BONG - COOL QUEEN

15
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:54,750
<i>This is Ja Ja Bong,
the school's queen. As cool as a cucumber.</i>

16
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:06,166
<i>This is Na Na Duong. Always wear a "No
Makeup" makeup with a sentimental look.</i>

17
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,000
Ja Bong!

18
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,916
Get out! Out! Out!

19
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:24,291
<i>La La Len Talkative Queen.</i>

20
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,875
Go, Quan!

21
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,125
Go go, Quan!

22
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:10,375
<i>And that is the group of
the most unattractive girls.</i>

23
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,833
<i>And confronting them,
is "The Great Man's Group".</i>

24
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,416
<i>Diu Tomboy Genuine Gentleman.</i>

25
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,916
<i>Skinny Guitar Skinny, Gaily, and Coolio.</i>

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,708
<i>Well-behaved Fatty A Sky full of manners.</i>

27
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,291
We have never messed up with you guys.

28
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:31,458
Why did you blame us
for our class's bad result?

29
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,166
You did nothing.

30
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,125
But distracting boys. Making
them lose concentration on their study.

31
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,666
<i>I've heard</i>

32
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,583
Ja Ja Bong will be a <i>Dep</i> magazine
bikini model this summer session.

33
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,666
Are you serious?

34
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:49,208
I'm late every morning because I dream of…

35
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,666
Make the girls just pay
attention to fashion, not lessons.

36
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,875
Bong looks good in anything.

37
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,208
Three scabby sheep can
spoil the whole flock.

38
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:05,791
What grades do you get?

39
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,458
Your grade is high.

40
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,291
Look. Great grades.

41
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,750
<i>What century are you living in?</i>

42
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,875
The brain is to serve beauty.

43
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,666
Nothing is impossible with our brain.

44
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,125
We get the Miss Idol prize
for our class every year.

45
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,041
Can you?

46
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,875
Just because we don't want to.

47
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,666
- Let's say you want to this time!
- Yes!

48
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,250
If you win, we'll
stand in front of the school…

49
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,458
…screaming out loud
that we are beautiful but stupid.

50
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:40,666
But if you lose, you have
to tell the whole school that…

51
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,750
Genius club is a piece of junk.

52
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,041
Genius club is a piece of junk.

53
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,791
THE AGREEMENT

54
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,458
Let's sign up here.

55
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,083
Hey! Hey there!

56
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,750
You forgot to zip your backpack.

57
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,500
Thank you.

58
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,291
Something wrong!

59
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,458
Is this yours?

60
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,916
My Quan!

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Who's that girl?

62
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,708
Jeez! He knows her period.

63
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,250
She's more special than you, Bong.

64
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,250
Do your eyes hurt?

65
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,958
Take these.

66
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,833
We'll get it signed next Monday.

67
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,291
<i>This is our headteacher.</i>

68
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:34,000
<i>She looks cold but has a big heart.</i>

69
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,125
So weird. Like a freak!

70
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,208
Looks so weird.

71
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,125
- So ugly! Hideous!
- Which planet is she from?

72
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,458
This is the last time I warn you.

73
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,291
You care about everything but your study.

74
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,958
Going to international school
isn't doing anything you want.

75
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,083
In my class,

76
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,791
anyone who can't study well
must repeat a grade.

77
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,166
Don't ever blame me!

78
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,291
An! Introduce yourself!

79
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,875
Gosh! Hurry up,
new friend. We have to study.

80
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,916
Hurry up! Come on!

81
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,041
I'm An.

82
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,583
Oh my!

83
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,375
Why does it take her so long?

84
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,083
Such a role model!

85
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,791
You're wearing uniform to the extra class.

86
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,583
Come on, guys! Don't tease her.

87
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,666
Wow!

88
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,791
I used to go to public school.

89
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:53,458
My Dad said I would be
more confident in this school.

90
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,458
There's a question you haven't answered.

91
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,666
What's your hobby?

92
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,416
I love reading books.

93
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,791
Wow! Tell us
some interesting stories.

94
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,791
I read about
the butterfly effect, the chaos theory,

95
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,416
the perfection of wisdom,

96
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,166
Greek mythology, Ancient Rome.

97
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,000
Do you love doing anything else?

98
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:16,208
Something less weird, like
playing instruments, singing, bowling.

99
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,333
Boring.

100
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,041
An, you can sit over there.

101
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,875
- Wow!
- How lucky she is!

102
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:32,875
- Hi!
- Is it all okay?

103
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,500
Sit next to Quan.

104
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,458
<i>So great to sit near a handsome
guy, although being teased a lot.</i>

105
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,583
<i>How lucky I am!</i>

106
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,083
Why does your hair
have a lot of split ends?

107
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,375
Why are you as fit as a bodybuilder?

108
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,708
Why didn't you eat anything?

109
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,250
What's wrong?

110
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,291
You didn't even touch
the peanut butter made by your Dad.

111
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,541
Why did you use
the whole bottle of medicated oil?

112
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,041
I'm fine, Nanny!

113
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,125
Your Dad dropped by your school,
then he rushed to the airport.

114
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,875
Apply for Miss Idol?

115
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,250
Yup!

116
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,625
You're a potential contestant.

117
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,833
Join our club and be
our entrant for the contest.

118
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,291
I…

119
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,291
- I…
- Don't worry!

120
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,708
Join our club,
okay? This world will be yours.

121
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:10,291
There are books on economics,
politics, philosophy, and critical theory.

122
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,083
Over here are books on
religions, spirit, theology, literature.

123
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,916
There are also books on applied science.

124
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,416
On economics there is

125
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,476
<i>"The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil,
Money &amp; Power"</i> by Daniel Yergin.

126
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,500
On psychology there's <i>"The</i>
<i>first and last freedom"</i> by Krishnamurti.

Or <i>"The power of Now"</i> by Eckhart Tolle.

128
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:27,833
On political philosophy,

129
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:31,041
<i>"The social contract"</i> by Jean
Jacques Rousseau is also a good one.

130
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,541
You can visit the Tam bookstore

131
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,250
on Nguyen Thi Minh Khai St.
Take a right to 496 Alley.

132
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:39,041
Then turn to 20th
Street. From there, turn to 20/10/7.

133
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,166
Many good, cheap books.

134
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,958
I gotta go home. Please find someone else.

135
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,083
I'm sorry! Are you okay?

136
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:24,833
<i>It seems this
is the book my Dad told me about before.</i>

137
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,250
<i>You've just heard the song "Our Memory"</i>

138
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,916
<i>on</i> "Tell Us Your Story on Friday".

139
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,375
<i>From our listener,
Hoai Thuong to her friend, Cong Danh.</i>

140
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,333
<i>May your friendship never die.</i>

141
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,750
<i>Up next is the song "Waiting
for you" from Ms. Lien to Mr. Tho.</i>

142
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:45,666
<i>Her message says "I've
been looking for you as long as I can.</i>

143
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,041
<i>If you get this message,</i>

144
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:52,750
<i>please contact me via
my number 0937005123</i>

145
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,250
<i>Miss you forever."</i>

146
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,208
Here you are.

147
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,916
Poor you!

148
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,916
Come here with us!

149
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,791
Sit down!

150
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,375
Here are some Fresh
cookies. So yummy! Try it!

151
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,541
<i>Jeez! I'm trapped.</i>

152
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,416
<i>Why was I so stupid that time?</i>

153
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,375
What have you done, Duong?

154
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,833
I am starving.

155
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,583
An! An!

156
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,791
An! Hold this please.
I'll go get something to clean the table.

157
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,500
Who's that?

158
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,875
Who's up there?

159
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,125
Watch out!

160
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,916
That fat girl is so savage.

161
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,833
Gosh! What's wrong, An?

162
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,041
Come here! Let me help.

163
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,625
Any tissue?

164
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,583
Oops! It's soaking wet.

165
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,541
You should buy a new one.

166
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,750
It's my Dad's
present from his business trip.

167
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,083
It isn't available here.

168
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,458
Daddy's home!

169
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,267
Something seems wrong with you.

170
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,625
I had to cancel the Singapore
meeting tomorrow morning.

171
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,541
I'm fine, Dad. Have you had dinner yet?

172
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,025
Did you remember your stomach meds?

173
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,413
Do you like the new school?

174
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,291
No man is an island.

175
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,166
Even books need to rely on one another.

176
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,250
Don't isolate yourself, my dear.

177
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,375
Hey.

178
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,666
What's that?

179
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,291
My cousin also has a book like yours.

180
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,875
Here's your stomach medicine, Dad.

181
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,458
- Thanks.
- I'm off for school, Dad.

182
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,625
Remember to make more friends, dear.

183
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,375
Do you still want to
go to Harvard University?

184
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,750
I've told you. Your GPA is not
all you need to get into Harvard.

185
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,750
GPA is just a part of it.

186
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:51,291
They're looking for active students.

187
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,478
If your profile has lots of great
extra-curricular achievements,

188
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,250
you'll have more chance to get in.

189
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,208
Does taking part in Miss Idol count, Dad?

190
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:00,916
Of course!

191
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:07,083
As the club president,
on the day An joins our club,

192
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,125
I'd like to ask for
your blessing, Mr. Einstein.

193
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,083
Please bless her

194
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,583
so that she can
contribute to human development

195
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,458
with her knowledge and intelligence.

196
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,833
Namo Amitabha!

197
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,541
I'm sorry. Thank you, Mr. Einstein.

198
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:37,208
Alright! Let's smell 100 books here

199
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,500
to absorb Mr. Einstein's philosophy, An.

200
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,916
There are four rounds in total.

201
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,291
Round One, Facebook photo.

202
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,916
Round Two, Knowledge.

203
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,250
Round Three, Interview.

204
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,416
And Round Four, Talent.

205
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,041
We first need to choose
an impressive outfit for the first round.

206
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:58,833
Please don't.

207
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,583
Give me back my shirt.

208
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,101
<i>The game's just
starting but this shirt's dirty.</i>

209
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,125
Okay.

210
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,333
If you take this
I'll take that one home to wash.

211
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,625
Then you keep it again? Come on. Hurry up!

212
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,333
Wait a minute! I'll find
Quan to recharge my energy.

213
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,166
Hi, Mom, it's me.

214
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,708
What's wrong?

215
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,375
How can I help you?

216
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,375
I'm busy, mom.

217
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:26,916
Thanks.

218
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:42,875
Ouch!

219
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,458
I explained to Quan. Don't worry.

220
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:54,041
He wouldn't believe
you threw his shirt away.

221
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,458
Look!

222
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,791
- What?
- What's that?

223
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,250
What? Oh my God!

224
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,166
Oh my God!

225
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,583
Oh dear! Unbelievable!

226
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,083
Can you see it? Can you see it?

227
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,208
I see all white.

228
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,791
Yeah,

229
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:15,934
two girls in white dresses.

230
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:16,791
As white as snow.

231
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,583
No. I mean I see a white wall.

232
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,375
Oops, my bad.

233
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:28,208
They always make
it exaggerated just to take a photo.

234
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:36,708
I think we should make
an outfit from recycle bottles

235
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:39,625
to deliver the message
of environmental protection.

236
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,125
And we'll use whatever is available for
makeup. We definitely get tons of likes.

237
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,833
It's strange,

238
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,833
but not beautiful, guys.

239
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:38,541
An has an oval face,

240
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:40,816
don't do her eyebrows too straight.

241
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:05,750
See?

242
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,041
I told you to let me
make you look prettier

243
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,958
but you didn't want to.

244
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,458
Let's come to the photo shoot.

245
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,041
- How beautiful!
- How beautiful!

246
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:41,625
<i>You need to have more than
500 likes to pass the first round!</i>

247
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:50,125
She got hundreds of likes.

248
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,583
Prettier than my girlfriend.

249
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:54,500
<i>We need 100 more likes.</i>

250
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:56,083
<i>What should we do?</i>

251
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:58,250
Mother Nature will
bring you natural beauty.

252
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,583
Come and check out
our make-over tips!

253
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:05,250
And that transformation
happens thanks to cucumbers, tomatoes

254
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:10,208
eggs, honey, pure water
and fruit juice. Everyone can do it!

255
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:18,291
Good news! Good news! The Beauty Club
is sharing beauty tips for you girls!

256
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:21,708
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
chance! Come on, everyone! Come on!

257
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:23,125
How rude!

258
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,958
Come on, come on? Are you a fishmonger?

259
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,166
Listen to me.

260
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,041
Ladies and gentlemen!
Come here, beauty takes it all.

261
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:35,666
How fancy you are!

262
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:41,666
Beauty doesn't take it all.
Beauty plus intelligence is the best.

263
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,666
Let's buy it.

264
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,291
The taste is also okay.

265
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,500
Buy this.

266
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,750
- One for me.
- It's hot.

267
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:52,041

268
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:56,583
Giveaway Vouchers! Vouchers!

Our club will give all of
you a 900-page-long book

on Western Philosophy.

271
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:14,291
You can read it all year, for sure!

272
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:18,916
All year long…

273
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,583
A fat pig,

274
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,583
a skinny stork

275
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,125
and a tomboy

276
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:29,833

BEAUTY SECRETS WITH QUESTIONS
BOOK LOVERS' CLUB

278
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,250
We have no more chance.

279
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:08,996
Photo voting is till 5 p.m.

280
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,000
<i>Now we have fewer likes than before.</i>

281
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:28,750
FROM KHANH AN WITH LOVE

282
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:51,041
How could you have those photos?

283
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,833
It's a long process.

284
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,791
Don't ever tell
La Len I set this mess up, okay?

285
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:00,541
FROM KHANH AN WITH LOVE

286
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:05,291
You ugly duck!

287
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,166
Did you do it to get likes for the photo?

288
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,041
What a pity! Your number of
likes fell immediately.

289
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:14,083
I…

290
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,166
I didn't do anything.

291
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:25,250
Oh gosh! How dirty! Let's wash her face.

292
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,375
Water can't clean her face.

293
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,166
Stop it.

294
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:44,458
Hi Dad!

295
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:45,583
An?

296
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:02,958
<i>Does the magic book really exist?</i>

297
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:05,583
<i>What do you mean?</i>

298
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:08,208
How could you say that to me?

299
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:10,875
You're just creating people like you.

300
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,500
Strict and conservative.

301
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:16,250
Teachers like you are no
longer suitable for this modern age.

302
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:18,750
Do you deserve to be a teacher?

303
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:30,291
An is super cool.

304
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:32,875
Gosh.

305
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:36,000
Only An dares talk like that
to a teacher here. I daren't.

306
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,541
- Yah so do I.
- Look at this.

307
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:42,666
She's our Miss Idol this year.

308
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:02,458
How's your contest?

309
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,500
It's okay, Dad. I passed the first round.

310
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,125
Congratulations.

311
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:15,541
Let's eat.

312
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:25,333
I had to find an organic
food store to buy the ingredients.

313
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:34,083
Nowadays many people
sell their consciences for money.

314
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:39,208
Cheating doesn't bring out any real value.

315
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:41,166
It can't last, sweetie.

316
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,416
Cheating's like a sweet candy at first.

317
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,083
It seduces you.

318
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,166
Gradually,

319
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:57,333
you rely on it.

320
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:05,416
By the time you realize that,

321
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:08,541
it might be too late.

322
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:24,583
Hey! Let's dig in.

323
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:25,500
<i>I'm like a fox</i>

324
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:27,458
<i>You're like a bunch of green grapes</i>

325
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:30,916
<i>When you're young and beautiful
I can't get through to you…</i>

326
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,208
Here comes the cake! Have a bite.

327
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:40,833
What's wrong with you guys?

328
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:54,625
Do you know who posted that clip?

329
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,541
I trust you.

330
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:03,208
But is what you said in
the clip really your thoughts?

331
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:20,958
Actually, An was partially right.

332
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,916
But she expressed
it a bit disrespectfully.

333
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:36,083
It's fine as long as you're apologetic.

334
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:14,416
What happened, An?

335
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:25,333
Do you want to give up?

336
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:29,083
At least you must try your best.

337
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:34,625
If trying my best means
hurting other people, does it count?

338
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:40,166
If it means doing
whatever it takes, does it count?

339
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:41,833
It does.

340
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:51,500
What's important is that after making
mistakes you know how to improve yourself.

341
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:55,833
That's what trying your best means.

342
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:05,416
If you still don't have any good results,

343
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:08,541
you can tear this paper apart.

344
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,125
Would you like to have
a ride with me tomorrow?

345
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:29,500
<i>You love the
yellow outfit, right?</i>

346
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:33,083
<i>There is a really nice song about yellow.</i>

347
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:38,541
<i>It's a song about a couple.</i>

348
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:44,083
<i>But the guy has done something wrong.</i>

349
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:48,958
<i>And he decided to write her a letter.</i>

350
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:51,583
<i>In which he said…</i>

351
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,500
<i>If she forgives him,
then on the day he comes back,</i>

352
00:38:57,583 --> 00:39:01,000
<i>he'll tie a yellow ribbon round
the tree in front of their house.</i>

353
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:36,666
Well, after the exciting first round,

354
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:41,208
now our 16 beautiful contestants will
move on to the second round - Knowledge.

355
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,541
<i>The fourth session, of
self-study, is canceled today.</i>

356
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:46,000
Congratulations, Nhu!

357
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:55,250
Fighting, Nhu! Good job, Nhu!

358
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:59,375
I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO FLY TO AUSTRALIA FOR
AN URGENT BUSINESS TRIP. GOOD LUCK, DEAR!

359
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:02,166
Next, please welcome
Ja Ja Bong and Khanh An.

360
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:09,791
Question One: In Vietnamese Literature,

361
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:10,958
who can become invisible?

362
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:15,083
Thuy Kieu?

363
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,750
What?

364
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:20,125
Although Thuy Kieu is beautiful,
she cannot become invisible.

365
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:24,666
It's the calligraphy master in the poem
called The Master, by Vu Dinh Lien.

366
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,416
Can you prove it?

367
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,333
<i>"The old man still sits there
Crossing the street nobody sees him"</i>

368
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:31,875
No-one seeing him although
he's there means he's invisible.

369
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,375
Congratulations, An!

370
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:37,041
Hurrah!

371
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:41,583
What phenomenon is used in physics

372
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:44,250
to help fiber optic cables send data
in telecommunications?

373
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:48,041
It is…

374
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:49,875
What's wrong with her?

375
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,416
Reflection.

376
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,500
Time is nearly up!

377
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:54,541
What happened?

378
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:55,625
Why did she just shout?

379
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:57,916
- Answer.
- Answer.

380
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,291
Any other answers, Ja Ja Bong?

381
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,083
No, I don't.

382
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,250
The answer is total internal reflection.

383
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:07,291
Ja Ja Bong, fighting!

384
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:10,666
In which country was

385
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,750
the first Euro Cup?

386
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:17,500
France.

387
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:18,625
Congrats, Ja Ja Bong!

388
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,375
A free falling object is
deflected to which direction?

389
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:34,875
It's… it's… it's below.

390
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:38,541
Ja Ja Bong, please!

391
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:43,125
It's… it's the East.

392
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:49,166
Congrats, Ja Bong!

393
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:56,666
Ja Bong!

394
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:19,125
How smart she is!

395
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,833
How could you come up with
the idea of putting ants into her clothes?

396
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,000
What a genius!

397
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,375
It makes me laugh thinking
about that nerdy An. Such a silly monkey!

398
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,875
Well, Ja Ja Bong has made history.

399
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:37,583
What should we say when I beat a member
of the Genius Club in term of knowledge?

400
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:41,208
Beauty takes it all.

401
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:00,625
<i>I'm sorry, Dad. Just one last time.</i>

402
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:08,708
They look pretty high.
You may trip and fall on the stage.

403
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:11,000
Have you ever?

404
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:14,375
My new style.

405
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,041
What are you thinking, Linh?

406
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:20,583
Don't you know Ja Ja Bong's
good at walking on high heels?

407
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:22,291
Hey, Bong!

408
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:26,416
If you walk on stage on these high heels,

409
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,958
the judges will definitely let you win.

410
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Hey!

411
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:36,000
I think cleaning tables with a mop
will suit you more than holding this.

412
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:38,375
You freak me out.

413
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:52,208
That's too much.

414
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,875
Who do you think you are?

415
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,041
Didn't you tell me
that you would try your best?

416
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:03,916
If she finds out
you'll be kicked out of the club.

417
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Let's go.

418
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:08,333
Based on your excellent academic record,

419
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:11,666
the judges decided to replace
the student who had an accident with you.

420
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:50,250
How was Bong?

421
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,250
She's got a sprained ankle.

422
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:56,375
But it's not Ja Ja Bong.

423
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:58,666
It's Nhu, Hao Quan's sister.

424
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:02,458
I've heard Ja Ja Bong
gave Nhu that pair of shoes.

425
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,291
What's this, An?

426
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,375
Pain killer. It hurts a lot, doesn't it?

427
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,708
That's very kind of you.

428
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:41,833
What have you done to help
people in need around you, Ja Bong?

429
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:43,583
Here's my answer to the question.

430
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:47,500
When we grow up
we will realize that we have two hands.

431
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:51,833
One is to help ourselves.
The other is to help other people.

432
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,541
An is lucky,

433
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,375
she got the chance because Nhu fell over.

434
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:57,916
That's nothing to be proud of.

435
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,333
But if we consider it carefully

436
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:02,833
helping others also
means helping ourselves.

437
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:05,375
Why do I say so?

438
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:06,708
Think about it.

439
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:08,041
ARE YOU COMING, DAD?

440
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:10,958
Once you have a genuine
desire to help others,

441
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:13,916
you'll have a strong motivation
to live better and more helpfully.

442
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,583
Excellent, Bong!

443
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,125
Did you guys see that?

444
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:30,291
Or is that an illusion?

445
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,083
Slap me!

446
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:43,583
- Does it hurt?
- Does it hurt?

447
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:52,000
Nonsense! Nonsense!

448
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,583
But… do you know
what she's doing in that room?

449
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:57,666
She is using that book to cheat.

450
00:47:58,583 --> 00:47:59,916
I'm not cheating.

451
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:02,125
I just want to make things fair.

452
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:04,291
You guys know I'm scared
of public speaking, okay?

453
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:06,791
Want to be Ja Bong?

454
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:14,000
Give it back to me.

455
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:50,250
Hey you!

456
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,875
Two boys and two girls. What are you doing
in the ladies' restroom? Get out now!

457
00:48:57,333 --> 00:49:01,750
To clarify how I helped the other people,

458
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:03,916
I'd like to ask Na Na Duong to help.

459
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:07,708
Duong, could you please give me my bag?

460
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,208
Don't go unless you want to look silly.

461
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:15,208
You're the one who looks silly.

462
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:17,708
Tien.

463
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:19,625
Parents got divorced.

464
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,125
Mom then married a foreigner.

465
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:24,208
You live with your step mom in a slum.

466
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:26,500
Your dad rides a bike.
You're at international school

467
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:28,125
thanks to your mom's money.

468
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:30,708
Then Ja Ja Bong
helped you join the Beauty Club.

469
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:33,333
As long as you have
to do everything she asks.

470
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:38,125
What are you talking about?

471
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:42,958
Duong!

472
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:46,625
<i>You think Bong
will keep your secret, okay?</i>

473
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:49,958
She's waiting for you on stage.

474
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:53,416
Aren't you one of
the miserable cases that she used to help?

475
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:54,916
Shut up!

476
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,291
Ja Ja Bong!

477
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:08,000
You're so evil!

478
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:13,708
Duong! Duong! Duong!

479
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,500
What? What was that?

480
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,000
Please ask the technician
to open the charity file for me.

481
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:53,500
I've always been keeping
these things with me.

482
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:59,541
Because they remind
me to keep helping others.

483
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:16,458
Thank you, Bong.

484
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:18,166
You did a really good job.

485
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:21,583
Khanh An on stage, please.

486
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:26,166
- Why did he invite Khanh An?
- What is going on?

487
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:30,583
She is not beautiful.

488
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:35,583
What you just did
earlier is very beautiful.

489
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:37,958
Just what we're
looking for in the school environment.

490
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:41,708
This is the best answer to the question:

491
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:45,041
What have you done to
help people in need around you?

492
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:51,000
Do you think both An and Bong
deserve to get into the final round?

493
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,916
Everything I did, I did it for our club.

494
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:25,375
What a noble act!

495
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:31,541
But it's all about cheating.

496
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:33,208
Our club can't take that.

497
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:39,000
Even when we lose,
we will lose with dignity.

498
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:12,250
Want to grab something to eat?

499
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:13,625
Maybe next time.

500
00:53:13,708 --> 00:53:15,125
Ja Bong!

501
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:19,791
Talk to you later.

502
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:23,166
Wow. An looks gorgeous today.

503
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,250
Great lipstick.

504
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:25,916
Yours looks brighter.

505
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:29,333
- It's nothing compared to yours.
- Yours is the best.

506
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:36,916
Have you made peace with Na Duong?

507
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:40,125
Why do I have to do that?

508
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:44,166
I swear to take back
everything I've given her.

509
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:46,416
Come on! You guys are friends anyway.

510
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:54,208
What's going on?

511
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,333
How could La La Len do this to you?

512
00:53:58,416 --> 00:54:00,216
She even put this on
the school Facebook page.

513
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,166
Hey!

514
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,250
La La Len!

515
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,875
Are you okay?

516
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:45,541
This brand is good. Bong should use this.

517
00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:48,000
Take care of
your skin for the upcoming Final.

518
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:23,958
Hey!

519
00:55:24,041 --> 00:55:25,750
Even though baking is for women,

520
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:28,458
you have to be tougher. Nobody judges.

521
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,958
Tough or soft?

522
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:33,083
As long as it's beautiful.

523
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,583
When cleaning your suitcase this morning,

524
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,166
I found strange men's underwear.

525
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,916
It isn't yours, is it?

526
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:46,166
You should get married soon so
that An can have both a mom and a dad.

527
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:52,625
It looks beautiful.

528
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:57,750
- Hey!
- Quan!

529
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:00,000
Let's hang out!

530
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,375
We have a test tomorrow
afternoon. Don't you need to study?

531
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:06,375
But it's tomorrow afternoon.

532
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:10,208
An, come shopping with us!

533
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:13,833
Quan, join us!

534
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:16,833
Let's go! Go!

535
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:18,750
Go!

536
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,625
Go! Go!

537
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:23,666
Your mom called me
from the States the other day,

538
00:56:24,166 --> 00:56:26,458
saying they wanted
you to pay them a visit.

539
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:28,083
And they've chosen you some ladies.

540
00:56:28,166 --> 00:56:29,958
They wanted to set dates up for you there.

541
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:36,083
Time really flies. I've been
living in Vietnam for 20 years.

542
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:39,041
Get yourself ready
for a shower of presents.

543
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:43,791
On your birthdays,
whether you are home or not,

544
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:47,458
An always makes you a birthday present.

545
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:52,041
But you always travel around.
You didn't spend much time with her.

546
00:56:54,416 --> 00:56:55,583
Well…

547
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:59,875
I'm busy running my business.
I just want her to have a better life.

548
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,500
You think money can
solve all kinds of problems?

549
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,750
What she needs is the love of her dad.

550
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,041
She wants you to spend more time with her.

551
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,625
To be honest,

552
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:17,958
I think An even loves
you more than her own dad.

553
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:19,750
But you're always busy.

554
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,000
You don't have
time for her. Poor little girl!

555
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:13,791
An must have
a really big surprise for you.

556
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:55,125
<i>Dad, with this lunch
box, you will never be hungry.</i>

557
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:08,791
<i>Thank you dad, for bringing me
up since I was an abandoned baby.</i>

558
00:59:17,416 --> 00:59:20,791
<i>Dad, hurry up! Let's find
someone to take care of you.</i>

559
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:24,250
<i>No matter who you get married to, I'll
love that person as much as I love you.</i>

560
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:37,500
<i>Dad, I present you with a lot of time
so that you can be home with me.</i>

561
00:59:37,583 --> 00:59:44,041
<i>Dad, promise me you'll spend
the whole weekend with me on my birthday.</i>

562
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:57,458
Hey! Let's go to
the cafeteria to welcome Nhu back!

563
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:58,541
Yeah!

564
00:59:58,625 --> 00:59:59,916
Hurry up! An's waiting for us.

565
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,875
Forget it. If she's there, we won't go.

566
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:09,708
What's wrong? I thought you guys…

567
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:14,666
Thanks to An, Nhu can
recover quickly. We must invite her.

568
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:21,041
Thanks to An?

569
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:24,541
You're crazy.

570
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:27,666
You thought
her heels got broken by chance?

571
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:35,583
An broke her heels so that Nhu had
an accident and she could replace Nhu.

572
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:51,625
Quan. I just wanted to harm Ja Ja Bong.

573
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:54,125
Doesn't matter who you want to harm.

574
01:00:54,916 --> 01:00:56,375
I trusted you.

575
01:00:58,375 --> 01:00:59,375
Quan!

576
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:01,416
Quan!

577
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:06,458
Quan, please listen to me!

578
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:22,208
<i>This is called "Karma".</i>

579
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:32,000
<i>Joking with me?</i>

580
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:35,000
<i>You think I don't
know what you're doing behind me?</i>

581
01:02:05,416 --> 01:02:07,375
I can't be seen like this.

582
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:09,291
The final round is about to come.

583
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:11,333
And Quan?

584
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:14,916
Hey!

585
01:02:18,041 --> 01:02:20,083
Time for class. Why are
you still reading books?

586
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:47,625
- Hello!
- Hello, I'm Khanh An's headteacher.

587
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:50,000
An missed a crucial test today.

588
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:55,125
She didn't attend
the class either. Is she okay?

589
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:59,041
She's fine.

590
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:03,333
Thank you. I'll talk to her.

591
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:23,208
Dad, your hair butter is the best.

592
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:24,916
My hair feels so smooth.

593
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:28,416
Dad!

594
01:04:34,166 --> 01:04:35,791
Do you want to tell me something?

595
01:04:40,125 --> 01:04:41,500
Did you do anything wrong?

596
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:44,291
Tell me, An.

597
01:04:45,125 --> 01:04:46,458
I didn't do anything.

598
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:48,250
I don't know what you're talking about.

599
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:03,125
Don't you want me to be
more active and beautiful?

600
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:06,375
I just did what they did.
If they can cheat, then so can I.

601
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:07,833
Shut up!

602
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:13,291
The world would be full of bad people

603
01:05:14,458 --> 01:05:15,916
if they all thought like you do.

604
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:18,125
You think you've become lovely, okay?

605
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:20,000
In fact,

606
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:23,500
you just turned out to be a bad one.

607
01:05:34,291 --> 01:05:36,833
I didn't know how to raise you.

608
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:42,083
This is all my fault.

609
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:46,166
I'm not capable of being your father.

610
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:50,583
Dad, I'm wrong. It's my fault. I'm sorry!

611
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:54,208
Dad! Dad!

612
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:57,375
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

613
01:05:57,458 --> 01:05:59,166
Dad, don't go.

614
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,250
Dad! Dad!

615
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:02,416
Dad!

616
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,041
Dad, don't leave me, Dad…

617
01:06:07,125 --> 01:06:09,458
Dad!

618
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:17,500
Dad!

619
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:21,333
How can my
sweetheart manage to do everything?

620
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:23,708
There are only two options.

621
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:27,458
<i>One is to face the pain with discipline.</i>

622
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:32,166
<i>The other is to confront it with regret.</i>

623
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:50,916
<i>An is still young,</i>

624
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,041
<i>she won't be able to understand.</i>

625
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,916
Beauty takes…

626
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,708
Takes what? Say it out loud!

627
01:09:44,791 --> 01:09:47,708
Why do you have to mumble?

628
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:49,583
Beauty takes…

629
01:09:49,666 --> 01:09:50,875
Hold on!

630
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:53,041
What is that?

631
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:59,375
The contest hasn't ended
yet. We don't know the winner.

632
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:02,875
They said they had quit.

633
01:10:04,708 --> 01:10:07,375
The one who signs this form
will be responsible for the contest.

634
01:10:10,166 --> 01:10:12,416
- Does the contest keep going?
- Do they quit?

635
01:10:25,291 --> 01:10:28,000
Hide yourself! Quickly!

636
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:54,708
I KNOW YOU WON'T LEAVE ME…

637
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:55,958
LOTS OF MOSQUITOES HERE.

638
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:58,641
YOU AND NANNY SHOULD TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF… I'M REALLY SORRY, DAD.

639
01:12:44,416 --> 01:12:47,166
<i>They said, if they forgive each other,</i>

640
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:50,208
<i>tie a yellow ribbon round the tree.</i>

641
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:11,208
Thank you, Anh Khue, for
your magnificent performance.

642
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:19,583
Coming on stage is our candidate
with the most likes and votes.

643
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:23,208
Please welcome Ja Ja Bong!

644
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:34,625
Let's welcome
our last performance tonight.

645
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:36,750
Please give it up for Khanh An!

646
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,208
Woooh look… It's Khanh An.

647
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:06,875
<i>Time flies quickly, leaving only memories</i>

648
01:15:06,958 --> 01:15:09,041
<i>Dear memories</i>

649
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:11,916
<i>I will always remember
The voices of my teachers</i>

650
01:15:12,625 --> 01:15:14,875
<i>Dear friends</i>

651
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:17,625
<i>I will always remember
Those times we argued</i>

652
01:15:18,208 --> 01:15:24,083
<i>So that when we are apart
The longings remain in our hearts</i>

653
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:29,791
<i>The longings for old friends
And old school</i>

654
01:15:32,291 --> 01:15:34,416
<i>Putting my hand on my lips</i>

655
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,041
<i>To hold back the…</i>

656
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:38,166
- What happened?
- Oh my God! What happened?

657
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:40,041
- What's going on?
- The music is off.

658
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:41,875
- What's going on?
- What happened?

659
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:44,458
<i>Putting my hand on my lips…</i>

660
01:15:46,791 --> 01:15:52,500
<i>Putting my hand on my lips
To hold back the tears</i>

661
01:15:52,583 --> 01:15:54,250
<i>Time flies so quickly…</i>

662
01:15:54,333 --> 01:15:57,083
- Lip sing?
- Get down!

663
01:15:57,166 --> 01:15:59,208
You're lip-syncing!

664
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:03,208
- You're lip-syncing!
- Get down! Get down!

665
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:08,250
- Stop singing.
- Get down! Get down!

666
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:19,708
How handsome!

667
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:22,625
What's that? Who's that?

668
01:16:25,083 --> 01:16:26,666
A new performance?

669
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:34,666
Yes! An has tried a lot to change.

670
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:44,125
<i>I knew Ja Bong would do
some tricks with the sound system.</i>

671
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:47,458
<i>Let's turn the tables on her.</i>

672
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:16,208
<i>Time flies so quickly
Leaving only memories</i>

673
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:18,833
<i>Dear memories</i>

674
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:21,541
<i>I will always remember
The voices of my teachers</i>

675
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:23,541
<i>Dear friends</i>

676
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:26,166
<i>I will always remember
Those times we argued</i>

677
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:30,833
<i>So that when we part ways
The longings remain in our hearts</i>

678
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:34,916
<i>The longings for old friends
And old school</i>

679
01:17:40,541 --> 01:17:44,791
<i>Putting my hand on my lips
To hold back the tears</i>

680
01:17:45,583 --> 01:17:49,583
<i>Could we stop the flying time?</i>

681
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:54,458
<i>My heart still regrets the good old days</i>

682
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:55,458
<i>Dear friends</i>

683
01:17:55,541 --> 01:18:00,333
<i>I can still hear your voices
And laughters echoing somewhere</i>

684
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:06,916
<i>All of my longings
Who can I send them to now?</i>

685
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:13,583
<i>If you have a wish for this life</i>

686
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:18,791
<i>Remember to wish for time to retrace</i>

687
01:18:18,875 --> 01:18:23,250
<i>So that the passions and burning desires</i>

688
01:18:23,333 --> 01:18:28,041
<i>Can stay eternal in our hearts</i>

689
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:33,375
<i>And so that our love
And dreams will never fade</i>

690
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:37,666
<i>If you have a wish for this life</i>

691
01:18:38,166 --> 01:18:42,583
<i>Remember to wish for time to retrace</i>

692
01:18:42,666 --> 01:18:47,083
<i>So that we can be together again
Making more memories</i>

693
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:53,000
<i>So that the smiles can stay forever
In our eyes, on our lips</i>

694
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:58,708
<i>And in our beautiful memories</i>

695
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:18,541
Dad, why are you here? I thought
you had a business trip today, right?

696
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:22,083
I have sold all
the stock of the overseas branch.

697
01:19:26,916 --> 01:19:30,291
Miss Idol, An! Miss Idol, An!

698
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:36,625
Miss Idol, An! Miss Idol, An!

699
01:19:36,708 --> 01:19:40,166
Thanks a lot for trusting
me, my dear teachers and friends.

700
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
But I don't think I deserve it.

701
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:46,500
I'm so sorry.

702
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:55,500
My Dad taught me to fulfill my
dreams with hard work and real efforts.

703
01:19:58,041 --> 01:20:01,083
But I have cheated to get what I wanted.

704
01:20:02,791 --> 01:20:05,500
That turned me into another person.

705
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:10,291
I hurt my good friends

706
01:20:11,625 --> 01:20:13,833
and even the people I love the most.

707
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:20,375
Then I realize the worst thing is
not about failing to achieve my dreams,

708
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:24,208
but about losing myself.

709
01:20:25,458 --> 01:20:29,000
Thank you everyone for
giving me a chance to make it right.

710
01:20:31,416 --> 01:20:33,541
I'd like to withdraw from the contest.

711
01:20:35,958 --> 01:20:36,958
Why is that?

712
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:37,583
<i>I still can't believe my eyes.</i>

713
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:40,416
<i>Hundreds of yellow ribbons are flying.</i>

714
01:22:03,958 --> 01:22:06,375
<i>Let's end the movie with a wide shot!</i>

715
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:09,666
See? I just quit in
the middle of the contest.

716
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:13,625
Are you curious about what
I do after this to follow my dream?

717
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:16,875
If you want to, ask
your friends to watch this movie

718
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:20,458
so that the producer will have
enough budget for the next sequence.

719
01:22:20,541 --> 01:22:22,083
See you then!
