1
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:57,057
Do you mind taking
the glasses off?

2
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,027
Yeah. Whatever.

3
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,969
Tell me about your
childhood, Charlie.

4
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:11,706
Okay, well, once upon a time,

5
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,407
I was a child.

6
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:17,144
Then I grew up, and that,
that's pretty much it covered.

7
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,485
-Oh, sorry, there's
no smoking in here.

8
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,055
Really?

9
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:29,323
Since when?

10
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:31,191
2007.

11
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,029
Brilliant.

12
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:39,433
I can chew these, but
I'm not allowed to smoke?

13
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,476
I don't think you're supposed
to eat the whole packet.

14
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,286
So what are we, what
are we doing here, Doc?

15
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,788
We're just talking.

16
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:01,889
Are we really, though?

17
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:03,423
About what, what are
we talking about?

18
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:05,727
Whatever you want to
talk about. Just chitchat.

19
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,294
Chitchat, chitchat.

20
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,598
No offence, but I
got plenty of people

21
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:13,333
in my life I can chitchat with.

22
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,208
I would like you tell me
why you think you're here.

23
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:28,549
I'm here because of a
broad, a fraulein, a chick.

24
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:31,586
A chiquita. A dame, if you will.

25
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,420
Maybe it was a fucking woman.

26
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,795
Why don't you tell
me what happened?

27
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:45,099
Start from the beginning.

28
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,368
Okay, if you really,
really wanna know.

29
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,474
So it all started with
this fucking tattoo.

30
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,884
My girlfriend's not
returning any of my calls.

31
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:07,155
She, she says I'm unstable.

32
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,289
I just don't know what to
do with myself anymore.

33
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,457
I just find myself

34
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,529
at home crying and
cuddling my cat.

35
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,999
And I cuddle it
too hard sometimes.

36
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,867
Have you ever squeezed
a cat too hard?

37
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:24,371
Stuff is, there's stuff
popping inside him.

38
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,775
I was like, Sorry, Craig,
but it feels like I'm not me.

39
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:30,044
It feels like I've got
like a hood on my head, so...

40
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,814
so do you know what I've done?

41
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,117
It's terrible. I put one of
my socks on my cat's head.

42
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,285
So he knows how I feel.

43
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:02,610
Sorry I'm late.

44
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:19,392
Um. Well, thank you,
Mitch for sharing.

45
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:20,928
Some appreciation
please, thank you.

46
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,064
For Mitch.

47
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,799
Thank you, thank you.

48
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,534
So, who's next?

49
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:40,347
So, gonna miss this.

50
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,350
What, what do you mean?

51
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,654
I'm moving on. New horizons,
gonna see the world and shit.

52
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:47,989
Wait, where you going?

53
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,157
Winchester.

54
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,459
Winche-- What the
fuck's in Winchester?

55
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,562
I met a girl. Yeah,
she lives there.

56
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:55,830
You met a girl?

57
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,765
Yeah, I met a girl. How
hard is that to believe?

58
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,100
No, sorry, no. Um...

59
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:01,903
How long have you
been dating her?

60
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:04,404
A few months, yeah.
Yeah, we met online.

61
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,207
We've been sending
stuff back and forth.

62
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,542
Mm, stuff?

63
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,877
Yeah, sent her a DVD.

64
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:12,713
DVD?

65
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:14,414
I borrowed my brother's
video camera, yeah.

66
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:16,284
Set out by the end of the bed.

67
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,720
Laid out some candles,
you know, set the mood.

68
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:22,256
And then press record, yeah.

69
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,925
Slip me old khaks off,

70
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:27,261
did the good stuff all
over meself, you know.

71
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,697
Took the tape out, took it
down Dixon's little couriers.

72
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:31,398
Went to the same place.

73
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,535
I gave it to the
fella, paid 399,

74
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,504
it was ready in
a couple of days.

75
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:40,875
Picked it up, stuck a stamp
on it, sent it to Winchester.

76
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,211
She's probably rubbing
herself off to it as we speak.

77
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,179
So you haven't
actually met her?

78
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:47,014
No. No, not yet, no.

79
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:48,583
How do you know
she's not a catfish?

80
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:49,884
She's not a fish.

81
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,451
What if she's
got a dick, Dave?

82
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:53,621
What, like a hermaphrodite?

83
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:54,956
No, like a man.

84
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,325
I don't know. I'll cross
that bridge when I come to it.

85
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,127
Well, you're fucking me,
Dave. You are fucking me here.

86
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:02,563
I'm sorry, Charlie. I'm sure
you can find another dealer.

87
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:03,496
Where?

88
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:04,765
I don't know, go
to a rough area.

89
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,301
Strike up a conversation, Jesus.

90
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,470
Rough area? And get
stabbed in the neck?

91
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,241
It's better than getting
stabbed in the back?

92
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,309
That's a dig at me, isn't it?

93
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,013
I just don't know
what I'm gonna do.

94
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:22,250
You're the only reason I come
to these fucking meetings.

95
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:25,452
Without you, what have I got?

96
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:26,854
Hm?

97
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,093
Fuck you, Dave.

98
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:36,931
Fuck you.

99
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:42,603
Well all that, bit
harsh. I'm a person.

100
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:06,827
Excuse me.

101
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:07,995
Have you got a um...

102
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,143
Haven't seen you at any
of these meetings before.

103
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:25,212
It's my first time.

104
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,083
How'd you find it?

105
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:30,851
Google Maps.

106
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:35,256
Oh no, sorry, I meant
like, did you enjoy it?

107
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:36,757
I know, I was joking.

108
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:40,728
- Yeah, of course.

109
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,564
It was great.

110
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:46,600
Cool.

111
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:49,537
I'm Charlie, by the way.

112
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:57,144
Cool.

113
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:02,550
I have a, I have,
I've got a car.

114
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,987
If you wanna, if you
wanna ride or something.

115
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,124
Sure.

116
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:21,936
What's your thing?

117
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:25,573
Heroin.

118
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:27,808
Glamorous.

119
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:29,443
Yeah.

120
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:31,145
What about you?
What's your vice?

121
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,314
Sex.

122
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:35,950
Sex?

123
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,184
Yeah.

124
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:38,285
Okay.

125
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,087
I like to fuck.

126
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,189
I love it.

127
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:47,628
Doesn't seem like the
worst addiction in the world.

128
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:54,068
What makes you wanna
stick a needle in your arm?

129
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,770
It's pretty fucking gross.

130
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:58,039
No, I don't inject. No.

131
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,074
It doesn't matter, yeah.

132
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,609
There are plenty of more
glamorous drugs out there.

133
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,044
I'll give you that.

134
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:04,378
But you chose heroin?

135
00:09:04,513 --> 00:09:07,048
No, you don't choose
heroin. Heroin chooses you.

136
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:08,682
Fuck off.

137
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:09,950
What?

138
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:12,053
Don't get all poetic about it.

139
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:13,921
It doesn't choose who does it.

140
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:15,489
It's not a living,
breathing thing.

141
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,626
You make your own decisions.

142
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,795
Don't use wanky poetry
to try and cover it up.

143
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:25,433
So who were you waiting for?

144
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,334
Where?

145
00:09:27,468 --> 00:09:29,103
Back at the community centre.

146
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:32,006
My boyfriend.

147
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,176
Oh, you have a boyfriend?

148
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,110
- Yeah.

149
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:37,978
- Cool.

150
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:40,781
Why, did you think I was
gonna fuck you tonight?

151
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:41,982
No, not at all.
That's not what I...

152
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:42,983
No, I was just trying to--

153
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:44,652
I'm fucking with you.

154
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:46,754
Yeah, okay.

155
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,891
Anyway, I'm gonna break up
with him tomorrow, so whatever.

156
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,259
- Oh really, why's that?

157
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:55,663
Because I
don't love him anymore.

158
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,231
Don't see the point in
staying with someone

159
00:09:57,364 --> 00:10:01,402
if you don't love them, even
if he does have a monster cock.

160
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:04,105
Monster

161
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:05,739
cock?

162
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,510
What's a monster cock?

163
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:13,848
Wow, sounds brilliant.

164
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,382
- Such a shame I don't
love him anymore.

165
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:16,350
Yeah, tragic.

166
00:10:18,553 --> 00:10:19,521
So when did you quit?

167
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,089
Heroin.

168
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:23,090
I haven't quit.

169
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:25,793
Why are you going
to the meetings?

170
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:31,065
I'll tell you something,
but it's like a super secret.

171
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,234
You can't ever, ever repeat it.

172
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:36,170
I haven't told anyone
this. You ready?

173
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,805
My lips are sealed.

174
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:38,806
Okay.

175
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,842
I actually meet my dealer there.

176
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,178
What?

177
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,648
Yeah, but he's
um, he told me today

178
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,117
that he's fucking
off to Winchester

179
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:51,719
with a girl that he's never met,

180
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:54,855
so that, that's Charlie
out in the cold.

181
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,560
It's that the
only reason you go?

182
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:01,862
It makes me feel
normal to be around

183
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,598
a load of other fuck-ups.

184
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:04,832
No offence.

185
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,133
None taken.

186
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:10,738
Is that what you
want? To be normal?

187
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:13,741
Maybe.

188
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:17,211
I know I don't wanna die.

189
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:20,748
We all gotta
die at some point.

190
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:24,451
Yeah, but I want,
I wanna be old.

191
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:29,757
I wanna be like 100,
old, like creaky bones.

192
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,362
You know what would suck?

193
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:36,297
What's that?

194
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:40,535
Dying the night before
your 100th birthday.

195
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:43,904
Yeah, that would suck.

196
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:48,175
Almost feel like your whole
life was just a waste of time.

197
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:49,343
Yeah.

198
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:55,517
Hm.

199
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,792
Well, thanks for the ride.

200
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:05,893
Anytime.

201
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:10,231
Are you gonna be at
next week's meeting?

202
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,101
Yeah, I think so. Are you?

203
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,937
Might be, if you're lucky.

204
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:20,274
Cool.

205
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,479
-Well, good luck trying
to find a new dealer.

206
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:29,817
Mm, yeah. Yeah,
I gotta do that.

207
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:30,685
Thanks.

208
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:35,990
Okay.

209
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:38,959
Well, thanks.

210
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,554
Did I mention I
was a sex addict?

211
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:36,884
- Hi, hi, is that Dom, Dominic?

212
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,352
Hi there, Dom.

213
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,422
I'm Charlie. I'm calling from
Hillcooks and Sons Insurance.

214
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:43,023
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

215
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:45,459
Sorry.

216
00:13:46,628 --> 00:13:48,062
Yeah, that's okay, don't, yeah.

217
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,076
Charlie? Quick word.

218
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:03,210
- Yeah.

219
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:06,246
Money! Let's go, people!

220
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,615
Yep, thanks.

221
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,655
- Oh, watch out.

222
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:16,457
Oh, I mean--

223
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,128
She, she, she, she's
gonna fucking kill me.

224
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,697
Okay, Charles.

225
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:25,567
I mean, I can't even
stand to look at her.

226
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,769
Just looking at
her, and her voice.

227
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,437
Her voice is like, just
every time she speaks,

228
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:31,939
just wants to make me, you know,

229
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,108
fucking punch
myself in the dick!

230
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:38,145
You know, and she's like some
annoying, little Smurf twat.

231
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:41,949
Always with the mah mah
mah, I'm so brave. Shut up!

232
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,484
I don't give a shit!

233
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:44,786
I know.

234
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:47,087
- Really gets on my tits.
Really gets on my tits!

235
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,288
Do you understand?

236
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:52,126
Well, maybe it's time to
get a divorce, Mark.

237
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:54,061
- I just, I just, I
just can't be asked.

238
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,831
It's the paperwork, it's the
dog. I fucking love that dog!

239
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:57,965
I know you do.

240
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,067
I love that dog!
It's just a ball ache.

241
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,636
What's, what's
the other option?

242
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,605
Are you gonna stay married
to someone that you hate?

243
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,006
Well, yeah.

244
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,142
Yeah, probably.

245
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,811
I mean, is that, is
that, is that stupid or?

246
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:11,979
Yeah, it's pretty
fucking stupid.

247
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:12,980
- Yeah.

248
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:15,817
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

249
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:19,754
Cowabunga.

250
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:23,858
So, uh, so what's
happening to you?

251
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:26,059
Are you, are you
seeing any, seeing any,

252
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:29,764
got any steam, any
flavours, you got any tang?

253
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:31,298
Charlie tang in the bag.

254
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:32,299
I don't know what you mean.

255
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,836
-Any, any women? Pussy.

256
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:39,841
-Oh, funny enough, I did
meet someone, yeah, at group.

257
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,408
Oh, yeah, heroin?

258
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:45,613
- No. I don't think I should.

259
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:46,848
Come on, tell me,
tell me, tell me.

260
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:49,784
Yeah, it's sex, she's
a sex addict, yeah.

261
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:53,220
Sex, sex, sex? Fuck off!

262
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:54,321
What?

263
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:57,024
I mean fucking hell.
Fucking hell, no!

264
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,426
No no, no no no! No.

265
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:00,895
You're seeing a sex addict?

266
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,362
I didn't say I'm seeing her.

267
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:04,666
Like, we spent the
night together.

268
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,033
Spent the night together.
Spent the night together.

269
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,034
Spent the night
together, I know,

270
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,670
you banged her, didn't you?

271
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:11,371
You Casanova, you hero! Uh!

272
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,073
Yes!

273
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:15,375
Fucking hell. What was it like?

274
00:16:16,544 --> 00:16:17,879
-Yeah, it was um...

275
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,714
It was good, yeah?
It was great, tell me.

276
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:21,048
Tell me, yeah?

277
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:21,850
It was good, yeah.

278
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:22,851
Yeah? Good, good.

279
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,218
It was sex.

280
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,420
Good, good, good,
great, great, great.

281
00:16:26,554 --> 00:16:27,655
Tell me, tell me
some more about it.

282
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:31,391
What happened? What
was she, what was it?

283
00:16:31,526 --> 00:16:32,426
Talk to me about it.

284
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,194
No.

285
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:34,963
- No, you know.

286
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,063
No.

287
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,197
Please, motherfucker.
I need this.

288
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:38,432
I need this, I need this.

289
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:39,801
I sleep next to
the same, you know,

290
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:42,169
miserable old
vagina every night.

291
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,171
I fucking need this for
the midnight wang bang.

292
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,138
Please tell me.

293
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:46,406
I don't want you
thinking about me

294
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,576
while you're masturbating,
Mark, so I'm good.

295
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:50,512
It's too late.

296
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:51,378
What do you mean too late?

297
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:52,479
Too late, you need to leave.

298
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:53,347
-What the f--
what are you doing?

299
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,682
You need to go right now.

300
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:55,449
Oh.

301
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,383
Get out of here!

302
00:16:57,585 --> 00:16:58,620
Where are you--

303
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,788
-Keep up the good work.
-Okay.

304
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:03,791
You're all so much stronger
than you think you are.

305
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,862
I mean, look at you, you've
all been through such hardship

306
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:10,732
and you're all still
here, triumphant.

307
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:12,667
It's great.

308
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:22,744
Look, remember, most pain in
life is temporary. It passes.

309
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,781
We've got to give
ourselves a chance,

310
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:31,451
some time to mend and heal.

311
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:32,554
It's important.

312
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:34,154
Because,

313
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:38,860
we don't want to put
pressure on ourselves.

314
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:43,565
We don't wanna feel pressure
to be okay again straight away.

315
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:44,431
Pain...

316
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:47,001
is why we're here.

317
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:52,406
Pain is the root

318
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,743
of all our various addictions.

319
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,146
Now I know you're all
here for different things,

320
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,214
but I want you to take a minute,

321
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,152
look inside yourself,
and ask yourself,

322
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:08,221
What do I want from
today's session?

323
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,479
Yeah.

324
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,779
What happened to your eye?

325
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:40,114
I tripped.

326
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,283
Who did this to you?

327
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,285
Does it matter?

328
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:49,691
It was your boyfriend.

329
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:51,258
It was my fault.

330
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,394
- Why, what did you do?

331
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,832
I hit him. He hit me back.

332
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:01,569
I don't know why
you think that's okay.

333
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:03,236
Did I say that, Charlie?

334
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:06,239
Shit happens. Why
you here anyway?

335
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,508
Well, you weren't at group.

336
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:10,444
I'm sorry. I couldn't
find anything to wear.

337
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:12,914
Is that really why you're here?

338
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:18,152
Yeah, I was just, I was
just making sure you're okay.

339
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:20,320
No you didn't. You
wanted to fuck me again.

340
00:20:22,724 --> 00:20:23,725
That's not true.

341
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:25,593
Bullshit, you
thought you were gonna

342
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,327
get your dick sucked tonight.

343
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:28,830
Not everything is about sex.

344
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:30,497
Everything that matters is.

345
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:31,866
You really believe that?

346
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:36,204
I believe that you
came here to fuck me.

347
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:37,705
That's what I believe.

348
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,107
Well, I didn't, so.

349
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,376
So what is it then?

350
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:45,880
Why are you here?

351
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:47,447
I don't know. I...

352
00:20:48,616 --> 00:20:52,352
I don't have this like
fancy poetic answer for you.

353
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:56,289
I just, all week I've been
thinking about what was gonna be

354
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,993
the first thing I'd say
when I saw you again.

355
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:02,563
What did you come up with?

356
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:05,233
Hi.

357
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,400
I come up with "hi".

358
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:11,806
Not the most original
thing in the world.

359
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,612
But I would have said "hi" back.

360
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:20,882
Really?

361
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:26,220
Hi.

362
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:27,487
Hi.

363
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,490
Do you wanna come inside?

364
00:21:37,265 --> 00:21:38,398
You can sit down.

365
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:41,102
Yeah, I know. I'm good.

366
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:47,642
How was the meeting?

367
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:49,243
Boring.

368
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:51,112
Full of boring people
telling a boring story

369
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:53,047
about their boring lives.

370
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:54,849
Did it make you feel normal?

371
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:58,753
No, not tonight. Tonight,
it made me feel sad.

372
00:21:58,886 --> 00:21:59,687
- Why?

373
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:00,922
Because you weren't there.

374
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:03,257
Well, you're here now.

375
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:06,194
- Yeah.

376
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:07,962
So what are you
complaining about?

377
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:12,633
I like you.

378
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:15,402
You don't know me.

379
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:16,537
Yeah, but what I know I like.

380
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:17,738
You like fucking me.

381
00:22:17,872 --> 00:22:21,576
Yeah, yeah, I do,
I did. It was lovely.

382
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:24,411
But I think it might
be more than that.

383
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:28,716
I've been thinking about
you nonstop all week.

384
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:30,417
Really?

385
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:31,719
- Yeah.

386
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:32,987
What have you
been thinking about?

387
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,791
I've been thinking
what it would be like to

388
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:39,426
wake up next to
you every morning.

389
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,761
That's pathetic.

390
00:22:40,895 --> 00:22:41,696
That's rude.

391
00:22:47,602 --> 00:22:48,468
Let me take you out.

392
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:49,503
Out where?

393
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:50,437
Outside.

394
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:52,573
- What do you mean outside?

395
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:54,542
Out there, in the
real world. Me and you.

396
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:57,444
I like it better in my world.

397
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:00,848
And why is that?

398
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:03,017
Because in my world,

399
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:05,987
I am God.

400
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:08,356
You're God?

401
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:09,323
-Mm.

402
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:11,559
That's cool. Very cool.

403
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:15,329
You don't strike me
as a particularly

404
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:17,531
religious girl, though.

405
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:20,768
Just because I believe in
God doesn't make me religious.

406
00:23:20,902 --> 00:23:22,370
Mm, true.

407
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,207
A friend of mine
used to say that

408
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,610
the feeling of heroin was
like God's petting you.

409
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:32,747
He wasn't religious either.

410
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,285
Almost makes me wanna try it.

411
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:39,353
I wouldn't.

412
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:42,023
So what do you say?

413
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:42,890
- To what?

414
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:44,659
Let me take you out.

415
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:46,260
- I don't know, Charlie.

416
00:23:46,394 --> 00:23:49,030
I don't really feel
that pretty tonight.

417
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:51,232
Okay, well, what
about the weekend?

418
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:52,400
- Busy.

419
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:54,035
Doing what?

420
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:56,070
Fucking my boyfriend probably.

421
00:23:56,203 --> 00:23:58,572
Yeah.

422
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:03,411
Wait what? Are you--

423
00:24:03,911 --> 00:24:04,745
What?

424
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:06,514
You're still with him?

425
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:07,315
-Yeah.

426
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:08,215
-Why?

427
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:12,119
I just haven't got around
to breaking up with him yet.

428
00:24:12,253 --> 00:24:14,255
I figured, whilst
I'm still with him,

429
00:24:14,388 --> 00:24:15,856
I might as well
keep fucking him.

430
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,625
What about me? What about us?

431
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:19,026
-What about us?

432
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,128
I, I don't mean
anything to you?

433
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:25,066
Charlie, we met
once. We fucked.

434
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,267
A week later, you turn up high

435
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,835
on my doorstep asking me out.

436
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:28,536
What do you want me to say?

437
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,538
I'm not high.

438
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:31,739
-Right.
-Thanks.

439
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:33,607
You asked me what I
was doing this weekend,

440
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:34,642
and I told you.

441
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:35,876
We're not a couple, Charlie.

442
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:41,349
You don't love him.
You don't love him.

443
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:42,550
What, and I love you?

444
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:43,918
-That's not what I said.

445
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:44,785
Mm.

446
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:46,053
I didn't say that.

447
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:47,288
So what are you
saying, Charlie?

448
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:49,290
I'm saying why don't you,

449
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:50,124
fucking,

450
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,260
why don't you fucking
fuck me instead then?

451
00:24:53,394 --> 00:24:54,095
Instead of him?

452
00:24:54,228 --> 00:24:55,096
-Yeah.

453
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:56,364
Right, what would
that make you?

454
00:24:56,564 --> 00:24:59,066
Um, it would make me the
guy that you're fucking

455
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,168
that doesn't punch you
in the face, for one.

456
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:02,937
Charlie, it's not that simple.

457
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,205
Why not?

458
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:05,172
Because he's not
the kind of guy

459
00:25:05,306 --> 00:25:06,874
you can just walk away from.

460
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:09,577
No shit.

461
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:15,049
He said he'd kill me.

462
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:19,020
If I ever left him,
he said he would,

463
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:21,856
he would slit my throat

464
00:25:23,257 --> 00:25:24,759
and no one would
ever find the body.

465
00:25:28,462 --> 00:25:29,463
I believe him.

466
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:35,870
Well...

467
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:39,273
we need to go to the police.

468
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:40,641
Obviously.

469
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:42,943
Since when did you
and I become a we?

470
00:25:43,077 --> 00:25:44,812
I'm serious. I wanna help you.

471
00:25:44,945 --> 00:25:45,746
You can't help me, Charlie.

472
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,048
-I can.
-No one can.

473
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:48,816
No, this is my life,
I've accepted that.

474
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:50,151
You need to do the same.

475
00:25:50,284 --> 00:25:53,621
Fuck just accepting
it. Fuck that, no way.

476
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:56,857
We could just, we
could literally just
disappear forever.

477
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:01,162
You watch too many
movies, Charlie.

478
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,799
Yeah, we can just do that.

479
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:05,866
With what money?

480
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:08,936
I haven't got a penny to
my name, and I'm guessing

481
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,105
all your life savings are
stored in your fucking arm.

482
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:13,474
I smoke it. I don't inject it.

483
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:17,378
Reality is, we're
gonna wake up tomorrow morning

484
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:20,881
and carry on living
these same fucking lives.

485
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:25,920
How much you think we'd need?

486
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:29,558
What?

487
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,092
-How much money to
start a new life?

488
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:32,760
- Did you not just
listen to a word I said?

489
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:35,796
Yeah, but you just,
humour me. Humour me here.

490
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,198
How much you think we'd need?

491
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:39,033
Oh, God, I don't know.

492
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:41,469
50 grand?

493
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:43,737
50 grand, what's 50 grand?

494
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:45,239
Who do you know
that's got 50 grand?

495
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:47,675
Ugh! Um...

496
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:49,578
The bank.

497
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,011
The bank. Plan A, rob a bank.

498
00:26:51,145 --> 00:26:52,279
Wow, that's Plan A?

499
00:26:52,413 --> 00:26:53,881
Yeah, it's not a great
plan, but it's a plan.

500
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:55,683
I'm thinking on my feet here.

501
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:57,685
Do you know anyone else
that's got 50 grand?

502
00:26:57,785 --> 00:26:58,986
Rich people.

503
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,890
Rich people, good one.
Plan B, rob a rich person.

504
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:03,691
Any rich person?

505
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:05,092
Yeah, no.

506
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:07,294
No.

507
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:11,098
We rob a rich person who
isn't gonna call the police.

508
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,367
You know, because
they got dirty money.

509
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:14,301
Dirty.

510
00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:16,470
Ooh.

511
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:18,405
Dirty money, filthy as fuck.

512
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,541
Okay.

513
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:21,408
You can't report
something stolen

514
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:23,512
that's already
been stolen, right?

515
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:25,713
Wait, surely you know
a bunch of drug dealers.

516
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:28,749
I know one drug dealer.
He wears a Casio watch.

517
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:30,585
And anyway, he's fucked
off to Winchester.

518
00:27:30,718 --> 00:27:32,253
What about a porn star?

519
00:27:32,386 --> 00:27:33,555
What about a porn star?

520
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:36,423
A porn star who moonlights
in fucking lonely women,

521
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:38,726
and those women pay him in cash,

522
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,928
and that cash he puts in
a safe in his wardrobe.

523
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:41,729
Would something like that work?

524
00:27:41,795 --> 00:27:42,930
I don't know.

525
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:44,465
Is there a lot of money
in fucking lonely women?

526
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,200
He gets around
five grand a fuck.

527
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,935
Five grand a...

528
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:50,237
Fucking, five grand?

529
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:52,873
That's, who is this guy?

530
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:55,809
His name's Jimmy.
He's my boyfriend.

531
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:00,281
Monster Cock is a porn star.

532
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:01,782
Yep.

533
00:28:02,283 --> 00:28:05,152
Mm, course he
is. Course he is.

534
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:06,887
He's pretty
successful as well.

535
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:09,156
Is he? Yeah, successful
porn star, is he, yeah?

536
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,424
Oh he's great.

537
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,126
Wait just one second.
Let me get this right.

538
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:14,495
You wanna rob your boyfriend?

539
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:16,665
Yeah.

540
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:24,104
Go on. Tell me what you'd do.

541
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:32,413
The first thing
you need to know about Jimmy

542
00:28:32,547 --> 00:28:35,983
is that he is in love with
every inch of his body.

543
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:38,986
And believe me, there
are a lot of inches.

544
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,322
Oh thank you.
You haven't mentioned that.

545
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:42,691
He's
been making adult movies

546
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:44,792
since he was 18.

547
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:47,895
By the time he was 21, he'd
fucked over 1,000 women.

548
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:49,163
You know how I know this?

549
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:52,032
Because it's a fact that
he is very proud of.

550
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:54,802
But porn is not where
he makes his money.

551
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:56,203
The housewives are.

552
00:28:58,105 --> 00:29:00,808
He keeps all of that money
in a locker by his bed.

553
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:02,677
After all, he can't bank it.

554
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,646
It's not exactly
legal what he's doing.

555
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:06,313
It's dirty money.

556
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:07,582
Just
like you wanted.

557
00:29:07,982 --> 00:29:08,916
So
what happens next?

558
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:10,552
We
go back to reality.

559
00:29:10,685 --> 00:29:12,052
Fuck off! We don't have
to go back to reality.

560
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:14,154
Fuck reality. We can do this.

561
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:16,524
This is a solid
plan. We can do this.

562
00:29:16,658 --> 00:29:17,358
He'll kill us.

563
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:18,727
Only if he catches us.

564
00:29:20,595 --> 00:29:22,830
Do you know the combination?

565
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:24,098
What?

566
00:29:24,231 --> 00:29:25,132
To the safe. Do you know
the combination to the safe?

567
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:26,066
Yes. Fuck, yes.

568
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,167
-What is it?

569
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:29,470
Two four four,
three four two five.

570
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:31,706
It spells "big dick".

571
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,474
Oh fuck, we get it,
mate. Jesus Christ.

572
00:29:33,608 --> 00:29:35,677
Look, Charlie, you have no
idea what he's capable of.

573
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:39,480
Well, you've got no idea
what I'm capable of. So...

574
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:41,348
You're a junkie, Charlie.

575
00:29:41,482 --> 00:29:43,350
You're unstable,
confused, fucked up.

576
00:29:43,484 --> 00:29:44,385
You probably won't even remember

577
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,253
this conversation
in the morning.

578
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:48,956
What conversation?

579
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:51,191
I'm joking. Don't
roll your eyes at me.

580
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,527
I'm joking.

581
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:55,396
But I've been a
junkie for five years,

582
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,565
and I still remember
to tie my shoes

583
00:29:57,699 --> 00:30:00,467
and brush my teeth and
wipe my ass, all right?

584
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:03,837
I've never been more serious
about anything in my life

585
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:05,774
than I am right now about this.

586
00:30:06,741 --> 00:30:09,843
I wanna rob your abusive
porn star boyfriend

587
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:13,347
and then sail off into the
fucking sunset with you.

588
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:15,650
You sail?

589
00:30:16,618 --> 00:30:17,686
We'll get a plane!

590
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:18,886
Wait a second.

591
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,954
Wait a second.

592
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:25,694
I'm not sure how I
feel about this story.

593
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:26,561
How you f--

594
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:30,264
Am I not supposed to be the
one that's feeling things, Doc?

595
00:30:30,397 --> 00:30:33,233
I mean, I'm not sure I like

596
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:35,235
where it's going.

597
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:37,137
Well that's what makes
it an interesting story.

598
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:38,439
Who wants to listen to a story

599
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:39,574
where you know how
it's gonna end?

600
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:41,442
I didn't say it
wasn't interesting.

601
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:44,311
Okay, but how about
we pretend for a minute

602
00:30:44,445 --> 00:30:45,680
you're not my therapist?

603
00:30:45,814 --> 00:30:47,749
Just imagine that
we're just two friends,

604
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:48,817
we're sitting in a bar.

605
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:49,818
I don't think so.

606
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,485
It's a little
bit of role play.

607
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,555
I'm sure you and Mr.
Therapist do it all the time.

608
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:55,757
That's none of your
business, Charlie.

609
00:30:58,392 --> 00:30:59,893
It's weird.

610
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:01,395
Weird how uncomfortable you get

611
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:03,330
when I mention anything
about your life.

612
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:06,835
We're not here to
talk about me, Charlie.

613
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:09,236
Mm.

614
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:15,610
And how does that
make you feel, Doc?

615
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:21,215
So do you wanna
know what happened?

616
00:31:22,082 --> 00:31:25,319
Okay, so, a few days later,
there's a knock on my door.

617
00:31:25,452 --> 00:31:26,320
Guess who it is?

618
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,126
Hi, what?

619
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,862
Hi.

620
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:36,964
What are you doing here?
How do you know where I live?

621
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,800
You told me to
meet you here at 11.

622
00:31:38,966 --> 00:31:40,234
You texted me your address.

623
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:42,604
You don't remember?

624
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:46,440
So much for never
forgetting anything.

625
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:49,009
Did I mention why
I wanted to see you?

626
00:31:49,143 --> 00:31:50,043
No.

627
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:51,546
-Aw.

628
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:54,114
-Charlie?

629
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:55,983
Fuck, man, I--

630
00:31:56,116 --> 00:31:58,586
Charlie, Charlie?

631
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,455
Charlie, why the fuck are
you wearing a balaclava?

632
00:32:04,024 --> 00:32:08,128
Fuck, oh well, that's
embarrassing. Sorry, yeah.

633
00:32:09,697 --> 00:32:12,399
Oh fuck, yeah, I think
this might be why

634
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:14,001
I wanted you to come over.

635
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:15,269
To show me your balaclava?

636
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:17,404
Yeah, yeah, I
thought we could maybe

637
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:18,506
wear them when we rob Jimmy.

638
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,107
You really made
me get on a bus

639
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,776
all the way over
here to tell me that?

640
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:26,681
Um, yeah.

641
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:28,215
You're a fucking
idiot, Charlie.

642
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:29,651
Wait wait, don't go. Don't go.

643
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:31,318
You're here now. You
might as well stay.

644
00:32:31,452 --> 00:32:32,720
Well might as well I do that?

645
00:32:33,688 --> 00:32:34,722
Um.

646
00:32:34,856 --> 00:32:36,724
You say um a fucking
lot, don't you?

647
00:32:36,858 --> 00:32:38,760
Only when I can't think
of anything else to say.

648
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,862
Uh.

649
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:44,298
But look, I've got,
I've got coffee,

650
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:47,401
and fruit loaf.

651
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:51,472
It's like fruit,
and it's like bread.

652
00:32:51,606 --> 00:32:52,807
It's like a fruity bread.

653
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,910
But look, I'm sorry, I just,

654
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:58,345
I really think I just
wanted to see you.

655
00:33:03,484 --> 00:33:04,519
Have you got a bed?

656
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:06,921
Um.

657
00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:15,262
I'm coming.

658
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:25,673
Shit.

659
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:30,177
Oh, shit.

660
00:33:31,913 --> 00:33:32,714
Whew.

661
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:38,185
No one has ever made me come
from going down on me before.

662
00:33:39,453 --> 00:33:40,320
Really?

663
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:52,967
-Can I ask you something?

664
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:55,135
Yeah.

665
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,137
-Why, uh,

666
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:00,107
sex?

667
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:05,279
How did you get addicted to it?

668
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:08,482
That's not
a fun story to tell.

669
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:12,854
Yeah, you don't need
to tell me obviously.

670
00:34:12,987 --> 00:34:15,422
I was just curious.

671
00:34:15,557 --> 00:34:16,323
-It's fine.

672
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:18,560
You asked.

673
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,130
Might as well tell you so
you don't imagine the worst.

674
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,236
When I was 13, my parents split.

675
00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:31,539
I stopped talking.

676
00:34:34,943 --> 00:34:37,579
At first, they thought
it was a protest, but...

677
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:40,147
after a few weeks, they
realised they should

678
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,416
probably send me
to a professional.

679
00:34:44,886 --> 00:34:46,353
Dr. Clark.

680
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:51,726
And that didn't really work
either at first, because

681
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:55,329
I was a master at
staying in silence, so...

682
00:34:56,163 --> 00:34:59,166
why would I open my mouth
to a complete stranger?

683
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:03,170
Thing is, Dr. Clark
didn't really mind

684
00:35:03,303 --> 00:35:04,939
that I sat in silence.

685
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:09,611
If anything, it was better
for the physical therapy.

686
00:35:13,982 --> 00:35:17,018
I would sit there from
5:30 in the afternoon

687
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:20,354
with the door locked,
whilst I was told

688
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:22,090
to remove my underwear.

689
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:30,197
I would sit there, whilst Dr.
Clark asked me questions like,

690
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:35,069
"Does that make your tummy feel
funny when I touch you there?"

691
00:35:38,506 --> 00:35:40,775
I would sit there with
a tongue in my ear,

692
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,845
in my mouth,

693
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,285
all over my body, whilst Dr.
Clark made me feel special.

694
00:35:56,557 --> 00:35:57,792
I knew it was wrong, but

695
00:36:01,294 --> 00:36:02,830
I didn't tell anyone.

696
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:08,002
The thing is, what's
so fucked up is that,

697
00:36:11,238 --> 00:36:12,272
I liked it.

698
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:17,078
I know that's not what I'm
meant to say, but I did.

699
00:36:21,248 --> 00:36:22,984
My mum started seeing
a difference in me.

700
00:36:25,419 --> 00:36:26,821
I was talking again.

701
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:33,594
So she figured that therapy
must be doing something right.

702
00:36:35,763 --> 00:36:37,297
And I stopped going.

703
00:36:40,134 --> 00:36:42,436
But I missed the
way it made me feel.

704
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:48,076
I never went back.

705
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:52,780
But I know what I'd do if I did.

706
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:58,586
I'd kill Dr. Clark for
making me who I am today.

707
00:37:07,862 --> 00:37:09,396
I need a shower.

708
00:37:22,877 --> 00:37:24,779
<i>So,</i>
<i>what's his place like?</i>

709
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:26,047
<i>Immaculate, that would be</i>

710
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,347
<i>the best way of describing it.</i>

711
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:29,150
<i>Not a single thing out of place.</i>

712
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:31,384
<i>He takes pride in</i>
<i>everything he owns.</i>

713
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:32,754
<i>So how do we get in?</i>

714
00:37:32,887 --> 00:37:33,688
<i>We walk</i>
<i>through the front door.</i>

715
00:37:33,821 --> 00:37:34,655
<i>How else would we get in?</i>

716
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:36,323
<i>Won't it be locked?</i>

717
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,159
<i>Yes, but I'll</i>
<i>unlock it when I let you in.</i>

718
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:39,426
<i>You're</i>
<i>gonna let me in?</i>

719
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,327
<i>You really need to let me</i>

720
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:41,062
<i>finish here, Charlie.</i>

721
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:42,362
<i>Sorry.</i>

722
00:37:42,663 --> 00:37:43,831
<i>After I</i>
<i>let you in, we both put on</i>

723
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:45,166
<i>the balaclavas and</i>
<i>head to the bedroom.</i>

724
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:46,366
<i>Wait, why</i>
<i>are we gonna rob him</i>

725
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,769
<i>when he's in there?</i>

726
00:37:47,902 --> 00:37:48,803
<i>Because</i>
<i>there's only one key,</i>

727
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:50,805
<i>which funnily enough, he has.</i>

728
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:52,840
<i>And he doesn't allow</i>
<i>anyone in his house</i>

729
00:37:52,974 --> 00:37:53,875
<i>when he's not there.</i>

730
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:55,109
<i>Okay, that makes sense.</i>

731
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:56,911
<i>So, what happens in the bedroom?</i>

732
00:37:57,044 --> 00:37:58,780
<i>I will carefully go over</i>

733
00:37:58,913 --> 00:38:01,215
<i>to the locker and open the safe.</i>

734
00:38:01,348 --> 00:38:03,184
<i>But what am</i>
<i>I gonna be doing then?</i>

735
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,019
<i>Making sure he doesn't wake up.</i>

736
00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:06,921
<i>And what</i>
<i>if he does wake up?</i>

737
00:38:10,224 --> 00:38:11,259
Then we shoot him.

738
00:38:12,693 --> 00:38:13,661
Shoot him?

739
00:38:13,795 --> 00:38:14,962
-Yeah.

740
00:38:15,096 --> 00:38:16,864
In the leg or something,
stop him running after us.

741
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:17,632
With what?

742
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:18,966
With a gun, you idiot.

743
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,469
A gun? Have you
got a gun, have you?

744
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:23,538
No.

745
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:25,405
No, because I
haven't got a gun.

746
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,207
Then we'll get a gun.

747
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:27,474
-Where will we get a gun?

748
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:28,876
I know a guy.

749
00:38:30,878 --> 00:38:31,712
Have you ever
even fired a gun?

750
00:38:31,846 --> 00:38:34,015
No. But how hard can it be?

751
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:36,851
Just point and pull
the trigger, right?

752
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:37,919
Yeah, just like that.

753
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:39,620
-Yes, just like that, Charlie.

754
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:41,289
Can you stop being
such a fucking pussy?

755
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:43,791
Okay, okay, who
is this guy then?

756
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:46,227
Some American, all right?

757
00:38:47,295 --> 00:38:48,428
Word on the street is
there was a drug deal.

758
00:38:48,563 --> 00:38:49,831
Word on the street.

759
00:38:49,964 --> 00:38:50,798
-Can you let me
finish my story?

760
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:52,166
Finish it.

761
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,468
-There was a drug deal
that went wrong in New York.

762
00:38:55,603 --> 00:38:57,738
Two local lads
killed his brother.

763
00:38:57,872 --> 00:39:00,174
Left him dead, shot in the head.

764
00:39:00,308 --> 00:39:03,544
So, he's now over
here looking for them.

765
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:04,779
Apparently, he drives
around with a fucking

766
00:39:04,912 --> 00:39:06,180
arsenal in his boot.

767
00:39:06,914 --> 00:39:10,184
Figure we could just
get one of those guns.

768
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:13,420
Sorry,
that's your plan?

769
00:39:13,486 --> 00:39:15,890
Yes it is, Charlie.

770
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:18,059
You have a better one?

771
00:39:18,526 --> 00:39:20,427
No. No.

772
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:24,065
All right, where would we
find this American then?

773
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:25,432
Sat right over there.

774
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:38,613
Okay, let's say that is him.

775
00:39:38,746 --> 00:39:40,948
What are you gonna do,
just waltz over there,

776
00:39:41,082 --> 00:39:42,850
be like, "excuse me,
Mr. Cowboy, sir,

777
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:43,985
can I buy a gun from you?"

778
00:39:44,118 --> 00:39:45,119
No way.

779
00:39:45,586 --> 00:39:46,053
Yes.

780
00:39:46,187 --> 00:39:47,622
No, no, no.

781
00:39:51,626 --> 00:39:52,459
Hi.

782
00:39:56,463 --> 00:39:59,700
Can we, uh, buy you a drink?

783
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:01,269
I'm good, thanks.

784
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:02,270
Okay.

785
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,907
How about some nuts or...

786
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:07,975
pork scratchings?

787
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:10,278
What the fuck are
pork scratchings?

788
00:40:10,978 --> 00:40:15,583
Sort of like dried
up bits of pig skin

789
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:16,584
with hair.

790
00:40:17,818 --> 00:40:20,354
They're actually a
lot nicer than they sound.

791
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:23,791
I think I'll stick
with the whiskey.

792
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:25,359
That's fair enough.

793
00:40:28,461 --> 00:40:32,767
So, we were wondering...

794
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,501
If you can buy a gun from me?

795
00:40:36,604 --> 00:40:37,805
Yeah, how did you know that?

796
00:40:37,939 --> 00:40:39,941
You talk very loudly,

797
00:40:40,074 --> 00:40:42,743
and I could hear every
single word you said.

798
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:45,780
That's a bit embarrassing.

799
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:47,114
Yeah, a little bit.

800
00:40:47,248 --> 00:40:49,183
Your friend
didn't seem so keen.

801
00:40:51,252 --> 00:40:52,353
He's just a,

802
00:40:54,322 --> 00:40:56,724
he just needs to
grow a pair of balls.

803
00:40:57,658 --> 00:40:58,458
She right?

804
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:01,595
Excuse me?

805
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:02,997
Do you need to grow a pair?

806
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:07,001
I, I, I don't know.
I don't think so.

807
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:07,969
So you've got some then?

808
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:08,602
Some?

809
00:41:08,736 --> 00:41:09,804
Balls?

810
00:41:09,937 --> 00:41:12,606
Yes, I got some, two
of them, thank you.

811
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,641
Prove it.

812
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:15,142
Come again?

813
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:19,213
I don't trust you. I don't
deal with people I don't trust.

814
00:41:20,448 --> 00:41:23,851
If you wanna gun,
get your balls out

815
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:26,220
and put them on the bar.

816
00:41:30,992 --> 00:41:31,726
Right.

817
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:36,597
Can we just, we're just
gonna have a little regroup.

818
00:41:36,731 --> 00:41:37,431
Come over here.

819
00:41:37,565 --> 00:41:38,799
-Okay.
-Sweetheart.

820
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:40,167
So this guy's insane.

821
00:41:40,301 --> 00:41:41,569
Of course he is.
He's fucking American.

822
00:41:41,635 --> 00:41:42,570
Well I'm not getting
my balls out for him.

823
00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:43,938
Why not?

824
00:41:44,071 --> 00:41:44,839
Because it's a weird thing
to ask someone you just met.

825
00:41:44,972 --> 00:41:46,207
Why so weird?

826
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,441
I don't know how many
germs are on the bar either.

827
00:41:47,575 --> 00:41:48,776
I don't wanna do it.

828
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:49,577
Look, just do it real
quick. Just whip them out.

829
00:41:49,677 --> 00:41:50,678
Just whip them out?

830
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:51,712
Whip your tits out.
How about that?

831
00:41:51,846 --> 00:41:52,446
He doesn't want my tits.

832
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,581
Whip your fanny out.

833
00:41:53,647 --> 00:41:54,415
-He doesn't want my fanny.
-Fuck me.

834
00:41:54,582 --> 00:41:55,683
He wants your balls, Charlie.

835
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:57,718
Come on. What is the problem?

836
00:41:57,852 --> 00:41:59,754
I'll tell you what. I'll
do it. How about that?

837
00:41:59,887 --> 00:42:01,222
He's not giving you
very many options, is he?

838
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:02,356
Fine.

839
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,591
-Fine.
-Fine.

840
00:42:04,392 --> 00:42:05,459
What will it be?

841
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:10,197
We gonna do this?

842
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,440
Stop right there.

843
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:23,444
You some kinda fag?

844
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:25,613
What?

845
00:42:25,713 --> 00:42:28,049
A total stranger in a bar

846
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:29,950
ask you take your balls out.

847
00:42:31,452 --> 00:42:33,854
That just makes me
think of two things.

848
00:42:36,257 --> 00:42:39,360
You're either a fag,
or you're desperate.

849
00:42:41,996 --> 00:42:42,797
Which is it?

850
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:44,732
The second one.

851
00:42:44,865 --> 00:42:46,333
You sure about that?

852
00:42:47,635 --> 00:42:48,636
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

853
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:53,040
Okay, meet me
tonight at midnight.

854
00:42:54,543 --> 00:42:56,877
Warehouse 19 at the docks.

855
00:42:58,212 --> 00:42:58,979
Don't be late.

856
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:02,216
The price is 2,000.

857
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:04,519
Right, 2,000.

858
00:43:04,652 --> 00:43:06,654
Is that, so is that pounds or?

859
00:43:07,522 --> 00:43:08,322
Pounds.

860
00:43:08,456 --> 00:43:10,658
Right. You don't take cards?

861
00:43:11,892 --> 00:43:14,462
Thank you. It's cash, he's cash.

862
00:43:14,995 --> 00:43:16,664
Cannot believe you were
gonna get your balls out.

863
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,433
Fuck off. I don't have
2,000 pounds either.

864
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:21,669
Yeah, right, just
leave it with me.

865
00:43:21,735 --> 00:43:24,071
Meet me outside the big
Tasco at 11, all right?

866
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:25,406
So you gonna come
to group tonight?

867
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,774
-Obviously not.

868
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:28,109
Nice to meet you.

869
00:43:28,242 --> 00:43:29,276
See you later.

870
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:34,115
It was at a party.

871
00:43:34,248 --> 00:43:37,051
I don't know how it
happened. It just kinda did.

872
00:43:39,954 --> 00:43:42,022
And, yeah, since
then I feel like

873
00:43:43,157 --> 00:43:47,895
my life's been a
bit foggy and hazy,

874
00:43:48,362 --> 00:43:51,732
kinda like I'm in a, like
a dream or something.

875
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:55,402
You, you ever had that dream
where you're, you're falling?

876
00:43:55,537 --> 00:43:57,471
You know, you're falling
and you're falling

877
00:43:57,606 --> 00:44:01,408
and just before you
wake up, you jolt awake.

878
00:44:01,543 --> 00:44:03,477
Like, I feel like,
since I first used

879
00:44:03,612 --> 00:44:06,013
my life's been like
that, I been falling.

880
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,283
And, I've just been
waiting for something to,

881
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:11,118
to wake me up.

882
00:44:14,255 --> 00:44:17,258
Wow. That's so depressing.

883
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:21,462
Depressing, okay.

884
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:23,130
Sorry, Nick, expecting
something a little bit

885
00:44:23,264 --> 00:44:26,367
more uplifting here, were you?

886
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,868
Fucking depressing.

887
00:44:28,002 --> 00:44:31,038
-No, I, I just mean, it's just

888
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:32,806
sad.

889
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,779
That bit about falling,
totally get it.

890
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:42,449
It touched me on a

891
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:45,620
like deep profound level,
like a human level.

892
00:44:45,753 --> 00:44:47,054
You know, like really,

893
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:49,223
whew, it's just sad.

894
00:44:51,392 --> 00:44:52,561
And depressing.

895
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,827
-Mm.

896
00:44:53,961 --> 00:44:56,330
You see, I seem to
remember about a week ago,

897
00:44:56,463 --> 00:44:59,833
you told a story for about
45 minutes about the time

898
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:02,937
you got so pissed you shat
yourself in a car park.

899
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,438
Whew.

900
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:06,907
Whoa.

901
00:45:08,142 --> 00:45:10,211
I mean, you didn't
have to attack me, man.

902
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:13,180
I'm just saying, we all
have this in common.

903
00:45:13,314 --> 00:45:15,650
Yeah, like, it
binds us together.

904
00:45:15,783 --> 00:45:18,352
It's just sad.

905
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:19,787
And, um,

906
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:22,423
and depressing.

907
00:45:22,557 --> 00:45:24,124
I come to these
things every week,

908
00:45:24,258 --> 00:45:26,227
and I don't say anything,
and the one time I do,

909
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,828
you're kinda like jumping on it.

910
00:45:27,962 --> 00:45:28,896
And it's

911
00:45:30,064 --> 00:45:31,265
annoying.

912
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:34,201
His hand's up, isn't it? Yeah.

913
00:45:46,814 --> 00:45:48,349
He said midnight.

914
00:45:48,482 --> 00:45:51,018
Why say midnight if he
doesn't turn up at midnight?

915
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:52,820
It's just, I hate
people who are late.

916
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,690
- Ugh. He'll be here soon.

917
00:45:55,856 --> 00:45:57,958
You've been saying that
for the last seven minutes.

918
00:45:59,827 --> 00:46:01,228
You're just
nervous, that's all.

919
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:10,304
Yes, I am nervous.
How are you not nervous?

920
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:11,640
-I don't know.

921
00:46:13,841 --> 00:46:15,476
And where did you get
this two grand from?

922
00:46:17,845 --> 00:46:21,248
Baby, I've seen some shoes.

923
00:46:21,382 --> 00:46:22,316
Oh.

924
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:25,019
-Mm, they're red.

925
00:46:26,755 --> 00:46:28,690
And they're latex.

926
00:46:29,691 --> 00:46:34,895
And I think that they would
go perfectly with this outfit.

927
00:46:37,364 --> 00:46:38,399
They sound really nice.

928
00:46:38,533 --> 00:46:41,969
You're gonna love
them, I promise.

929
00:46:42,102 --> 00:46:44,171
Go on. How much are they?

930
00:46:45,272 --> 00:46:46,440
2,000?

931
00:46:46,574 --> 00:46:48,777
Baby, that is a lot of money.

932
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:53,347
Well, you did forget
my birthday last month.

933
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:57,051
And you know, they're
just as much for you

934
00:46:57,184 --> 00:46:58,886
as they are for me.

935
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:01,088
Baby, you're turning me on.

936
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:05,527
-They're one of a
kind, just like you.

937
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,294
Just like me.

938
00:47:07,595 --> 00:47:09,063
Oh, I think I'm gonna come.

939
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:11,398
Oh, can I buy the shoes?

940
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:12,399
Oh, baby.

941
00:47:13,434 --> 00:47:15,035
Can I buy the shoes?

942
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:16,036
Oh, I'm coming.

943
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,905
Can I buy the fucking shoes?

944
00:47:18,038 --> 00:47:20,742
Yes, buy the fucking shoes!

945
00:47:20,908 --> 00:47:21,743
Thank you.

946
00:47:26,548 --> 00:47:27,981
You fucked him again?

947
00:47:28,115 --> 00:47:30,618
What the fuck? No, did you
not just listen to the story?

948
00:47:30,752 --> 00:47:32,319
The story where you
just made him come?

949
00:47:32,453 --> 00:47:33,987
But we didn't fuck.

950
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:35,422
I beg to differ.

951
00:47:35,757 --> 00:47:37,792
You beg to differ
that we fucked?

952
00:47:38,459 --> 00:47:40,628
Well how would you feel if
it was the other way around?

953
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:43,964
Hello, Charlie.

954
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,467
I'm sorry.

955
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:54,375
Yeah. You did what
you had to do, I guess.

956
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:01,783
This is fucking ridiculous
now. Where the fuck is he?

957
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:03,217
He'll be here.

958
00:48:09,456 --> 00:48:10,525
What if he shoots us?

959
00:48:10,658 --> 00:48:11,959
Why would he shoot us?

960
00:48:13,561 --> 00:48:15,963
I don't know. He's an
American, isn't he?

961
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:17,965
Don't they just walk around
and shoot anyone willy-nilly?

962
00:48:18,098 --> 00:48:20,535
Willy-nilly,
who the fuck says that?

963
00:48:20,668 --> 00:48:21,368
I say that.

964
00:48:21,502 --> 00:48:22,269
-Right.

965
00:48:24,438 --> 00:48:25,005
Give me your hand.

966
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:25,707
-What?

967
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,808
Give me your hand.

968
00:48:27,709 --> 00:48:29,811
Feel how fucking fast my
heart is beating right now.

969
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:32,045
Probably got something
to do with the amount

970
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:33,313
of heroin that's been
through your system.

971
00:48:33,447 --> 00:48:35,617
No no no, this is
different, this is different.

972
00:48:37,317 --> 00:48:40,154
This feels, this
is bad, it's bad.

973
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:41,255
We should go, we
should leave this.

974
00:48:41,388 --> 00:48:42,456
No, no, what the
fuck are you doing?

975
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:43,591
Charlie, just look
at me. Let's breathe.

976
00:48:46,326 --> 00:48:47,194
Breathe with me.

977
00:48:50,732 --> 00:48:52,700
Okay, breathe it out.

978
00:48:52,834 --> 00:48:55,068
Maybe, we should just go inside

979
00:48:55,202 --> 00:48:56,437
and have a look
if he's in there.

980
00:48:56,571 --> 00:48:58,506
Hm? How's that sound?

981
00:49:01,408 --> 00:49:03,210
Yeah, that's actually
a really good idea.

982
00:49:03,343 --> 00:49:04,378
-Yeah. Okay.

983
00:49:04,512 --> 00:49:05,446
We shoulda done
that when we got here.

984
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,581
-Right.

985
00:49:06,714 --> 00:49:07,916
Let's go look inside.

986
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:09,684
Okay.

987
00:49:17,024 --> 00:49:18,225
You're late.

988
00:49:38,045 --> 00:49:39,179
Have you got the gun?

989
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:43,383
I've got the gun.

990
00:49:47,221 --> 00:49:48,088
Can we see it?

991
00:49:48,957 --> 00:49:50,491
Money first.

992
00:49:52,092 --> 00:49:53,126
Get the money.

993
00:49:56,396 --> 00:49:57,164
Uh.

994
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,767
Throw it over.

995
00:50:04,973 --> 00:50:05,874
Oh.

996
00:50:06,206 --> 00:50:08,643
The wallet, you
stupid fucking idiot.

997
00:50:08,776 --> 00:50:10,512
Put the money in the
wallet and throw it over.

998
00:50:10,645 --> 00:50:11,880
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

999
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:34,702
You're such an idiot.

1000
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:49,784
It's in the trunk.

1001
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:52,520
You mean the boot?

1002
00:50:53,086 --> 00:50:54,622
I mean the trunk.

1003
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,190
That's what
Americans call boots.

1004
00:50:57,324 --> 00:50:58,325
I know.

1005
00:50:59,928 --> 00:51:00,762
Don't worry.

1006
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,431
I won't shoot you in the back.

1007
00:51:19,146 --> 00:51:20,147
What is that?

1008
00:51:20,815 --> 00:51:21,849
It's a gun.

1009
00:51:23,885 --> 00:51:25,152
What are we supposed
to do with that?

1010
00:51:25,218 --> 00:51:27,055
You ordered a
gun. That's a gun.

1011
00:51:27,187 --> 00:51:29,023
That is a gun.
Yeah, that is a gun.

1012
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:32,727
That is a gun used to shoot
deer with in about 1880.

1013
00:51:34,428 --> 00:51:35,395
You haven't got anything
smaller, have you?

1014
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,431
You didn't specify size.

1015
00:51:37,565 --> 00:51:39,232
No, I know that, but I mean,

1016
00:51:39,366 --> 00:51:40,500
what am I supposed
to do with this?

1017
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:43,538
I can't hide this. It
isn't very subtle, is it?

1018
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:45,238
Wear an overcoat.

1019
00:51:45,372 --> 00:51:46,641
I don't have an overcoat.

1020
00:51:46,774 --> 00:51:48,076
Well, buy one.

1021
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:49,077
Brilliant, so
now I have to buy

1022
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:50,912
an overcoat as well as this?

1023
00:51:51,045 --> 00:51:53,014
We don't, I don't
actually want this.

1024
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,751
So, so you take that,
I'll take the money back

1025
00:51:56,884 --> 00:51:58,285
and then we'll just
go our separate ways.

1026
00:51:58,418 --> 00:52:00,054
No refunds.

1027
00:52:01,756 --> 00:52:03,457
What the fuck do
you mean no refunds?

1028
00:52:03,591 --> 00:52:05,960
I mean no fucking refunds.

1029
00:52:06,094 --> 00:52:08,228
You ordered a gun. That's a gun!

1030
00:52:08,596 --> 00:52:09,764
That's bullshit.

1031
00:52:09,897 --> 00:52:12,199
Tell someone who gives a shit.

1032
00:52:13,735 --> 00:52:14,669
You netted us 2,000--

1033
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:17,505
- Oh, Charlie,
wait. What the fuck?

1034
00:52:19,073 --> 00:52:20,541
Whoa, whoa whoa whoa.

1035
00:52:20,675 --> 00:52:23,778
Okay, why doesn't
everyone just chill out?

1036
00:52:24,512 --> 00:52:26,514
We're cool. We're cool.

1037
00:52:26,648 --> 00:52:29,216
Just that is,

1038
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,885
is like exactly what we need.

1039
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:32,219
Can we not have that one?

1040
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,855
This is my gun.

1041
00:52:33,988 --> 00:52:35,790
But it's literally
the perfect size.

1042
00:52:35,923 --> 00:52:38,559
So is my dick. You
want some of that?

1043
00:52:39,594 --> 00:52:42,063
My advice to you
is take that rifle

1044
00:52:42,229 --> 00:52:44,398
and get the fuck outta here.

1045
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:46,233
-Okay.
-Okay.

1046
00:52:46,668 --> 00:52:47,434
Okay.

1047
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:51,471
One second, though. Is this
thing even loaded like?

1048
00:52:51,606 --> 00:52:52,674
- Of course it's fucking loaded.

1049
00:52:53,608 --> 00:52:54,942
- Ah!

1050
00:52:55,076 --> 00:52:56,678
Ah! I'm so sorry.

1051
00:52:56,811 --> 00:52:58,846
That was, my finger
was on the, I...

1052
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,313
You shot me, kid!

1053
00:53:00,447 --> 00:53:02,249
I did. I did, but
that was an accident.

1054
00:53:02,382 --> 00:53:04,317
Now I'm gonna shoot you!

1055
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:18,566
Oh, fuck me! I can't
believe he shot me!

1056
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,667
Ow!

1057
00:53:19,801 --> 00:53:22,402
Oh Jesus, it's
a fucking graze.

1058
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:25,707
From a bullet. It's a
graze from a fucking bullet.

1059
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,340
Will you stop being
such a fucking baby?

1060
00:53:27,474 --> 00:53:28,910
Have you ever been shot?

1061
00:53:29,043 --> 00:53:29,644
What?

1062
00:53:29,777 --> 00:53:30,878
Have you ever been shot?

1063
00:53:31,012 --> 00:53:32,279
No.

1064
00:53:32,412 --> 00:53:34,148
No, then until you get
shot, you can't say anything.

1065
00:53:34,281 --> 00:53:35,950
Fuck me. Ow!

1066
00:53:37,284 --> 00:53:37,885
Ow!

1067
00:53:57,705 --> 00:53:59,674
Ah! Ah!

1068
00:54:01,876 --> 00:54:04,078
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me!

1069
00:54:04,212 --> 00:54:05,312
Ow! Ow!

1070
00:54:07,115 --> 00:54:08,315
Who the fuck are you?

1071
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:27,935
Are you hibernating?

1072
00:54:29,904 --> 00:54:31,105
Did you hear what I said?

1073
00:54:31,873 --> 00:54:33,406
Are you hibernating?

1074
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:38,646
Are you a dirty little hedgehog?

1075
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,181
I can see that.

1076
00:54:41,616 --> 00:54:43,050
What I can't see

1077
00:54:43,785 --> 00:54:48,156
is what my girl would see in
a fucking junkie hedgehog.

1078
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:50,558
Can you explain it to me?

1079
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:52,026
Mm-hm.

1080
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,695
Yeah, she's with
me for my big dick.

1081
00:54:54,829 --> 00:54:56,030
What did you say?

1082
00:54:57,265 --> 00:55:00,400
You got fucking balls,
I'll give you that.

1083
00:55:01,002 --> 00:55:02,469
Let's have a little bet, huh?

1084
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:08,075
Whoever hast he biggest
dick gets the girl.

1085
00:55:10,377 --> 00:55:11,012
What?

1086
00:55:15,883 --> 00:55:17,185
How's that for you?

1087
00:55:17,384 --> 00:55:19,187
Did you seriously
just get your dick out?

1088
00:55:19,386 --> 00:55:20,254
Your turn.

1089
00:55:22,023 --> 00:55:23,524
No, thank you.

1090
00:55:23,658 --> 00:55:24,659
Why not?

1091
00:55:25,126 --> 00:55:27,094
Well, I don't want to.

1092
00:55:27,228 --> 00:55:29,664
I want you to look at it.

1093
00:55:29,797 --> 00:55:30,865
I don't want to.

1094
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:33,100
Look at my dick.

1095
00:55:33,234 --> 00:55:34,535
Please text me
a picture of it--

1096
00:55:34,669 --> 00:55:38,639
I'm not asking. Look
at my fucking dick.

1097
00:55:38,773 --> 00:55:39,540
I'm actually not gonna.

1098
00:55:39,674 --> 00:55:43,077
Look at my fucking dick.

1099
00:55:44,946 --> 00:55:47,414
Aw, fuck, yeah.
I saw it, mate.

1100
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,950
Come closer.

1101
00:55:49,717 --> 00:55:50,751
-What?

1102
00:55:51,418 --> 00:55:52,687
Come

1103
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:53,821
closer.

1104
00:55:53,955 --> 00:55:56,057
What? What?

1105
00:55:56,456 --> 00:55:58,326
Come closer.

1106
00:55:58,458 --> 00:56:00,427
-What the fuck is going on?

1107
00:56:01,662 --> 00:56:03,097
-Don't make me ask again.

1108
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:06,601
I'm gonna fucking do
it, just give me a second.

1109
00:56:08,336 --> 00:56:09,436
There you go.

1110
00:56:09,537 --> 00:56:10,304
Closer.

1111
00:56:12,573 --> 00:56:15,076
You are fucking odd. Odd.

1112
00:56:16,577 --> 00:56:17,812
-Closer.

1113
00:56:21,282 --> 00:56:22,449
Closer.

1114
00:56:30,258 --> 00:56:31,325
What happened?

1115
00:56:34,762 --> 00:56:37,698
-Now, if you ever

1116
00:56:38,666 --> 00:56:41,269
come near my girl

1117
00:56:41,669 --> 00:56:43,037
ever again,

1118
00:56:43,371 --> 00:56:45,773
and I will fucking
kill you with it.

1119
00:56:46,707 --> 00:56:48,475
You understand me, Hedge?

1120
00:56:49,176 --> 00:56:51,245
Do you understand?

1121
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:55,116
Capiche. Got it.

1122
00:56:55,716 --> 00:56:56,751
Fucking got it.

1123
00:56:57,785 --> 00:56:58,586
Good.

1124
00:57:00,254 --> 00:57:01,222
Fuck me.

1125
00:57:07,528 --> 00:57:08,296
Charlie?

1126
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:14,168
Charlie?

1127
00:57:14,969 --> 00:57:15,770
Charlie?

1128
00:57:18,673 --> 00:57:19,373
Hi.

1129
00:57:19,507 --> 00:57:20,775
-Hi.
-Welcome back.

1130
00:57:23,077 --> 00:57:24,946
Is everything okay?

1131
00:57:25,513 --> 00:57:26,147
Yeah.

1132
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:29,650
Great.

1133
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:34,188
Have you got something you
want to share with the group?

1134
00:57:35,523 --> 00:57:39,093
I'm not really in the mood
for share tonight, actually.

1135
00:57:41,195 --> 00:57:44,298
I don't even know why
I came. I'm gonna go.

1136
00:57:44,432 --> 00:57:45,733
-Charlie, um,

1137
00:57:47,034 --> 00:57:48,102
what are you saying?

1138
00:57:50,338 --> 00:57:51,439
I'm saying

1139
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,843
fuck sharing, I'm gonna
be selfish for a bit.

1140
00:57:56,844 --> 00:57:59,880
-But what if, what
if I suggested to you,

1141
00:58:00,014 --> 00:58:02,550
perhaps, and, and
just something for you

1142
00:58:02,683 --> 00:58:04,285
to think about and work on?

1143
00:58:04,418 --> 00:58:05,219
What?

1144
00:58:06,587 --> 00:58:09,557
Maybe that selfishness
is what brought

1145
00:58:09,623 --> 00:58:11,025
you here in the first place.

1146
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:15,896
Uh, it's not. Heroin is.

1147
00:58:16,764 --> 00:58:19,633
And I wasn't selfish. I
always shared my needles.

1148
00:58:21,836 --> 00:58:23,104
That was,

1149
00:58:23,671 --> 00:58:25,840
I, I smoke heroin, I
don't even inject it.

1150
00:58:25,973 --> 00:58:29,110
That was a joke. Fucking
lighten up, tough crowd.

1151
00:58:29,243 --> 00:58:30,778
I think I can
speak for the group

1152
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:32,780
when I say that wasn't funny.

1153
00:58:33,848 --> 00:58:36,650
Yeah, I sensed that
when nobody laughed.

1154
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:39,787
And look,

1155
00:58:41,589 --> 00:58:42,323
to be honest,

1156
00:58:43,491 --> 00:58:45,493
I don't think this is
working out for me.

1157
00:58:47,628 --> 00:58:50,965
Because, I'll be honest
with you right now,

1158
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:54,602
I get high all the time still.

1159
00:58:56,103 --> 00:58:57,071
I'm still using.

1160
00:58:58,039 --> 00:58:59,407
I'm high right now.

1161
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:01,675
Sh.

1162
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:03,677
Thank you.

1163
00:59:03,811 --> 00:59:05,079
-Welcome.
-Yeah.

1164
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:08,616
That's brave, and
you are among friends.

1165
00:59:09,016 --> 00:59:11,685
And there is no
judgement here, Charlie,

1166
00:59:12,253 --> 00:59:14,021
but please, I implore you.

1167
00:59:15,489 --> 00:59:19,693
Just take a minute, just
for yourself, get centred.

1168
00:59:21,729 --> 00:59:23,064
Maybe have a cup of tea.

1169
00:59:24,498 --> 00:59:25,933
Something nice and hot,
and a nice biscuit.

1170
00:59:26,067 --> 00:59:27,435
-I'm not a kid.

1171
00:59:28,335 --> 00:59:29,804
None of us are kids.

1172
00:59:30,404 --> 00:59:33,007
And talking about this shit

1173
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,475
doesn't actually
make it any easier.

1174
00:59:34,642 --> 00:59:37,278
In fact, it makes
it fucking harder.

1175
00:59:38,913 --> 00:59:42,016
Okay, I come here every
week, and we talk and,

1176
00:59:43,284 --> 00:59:45,653
and it reminds me that
the only thing that's ever

1177
00:59:45,753 --> 00:59:48,389
made me happy in my life

1178
00:59:50,324 --> 00:59:51,492
is heroin.

1179
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:52,726
Charlie, go to
your happy place.

1180
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,229
My happy place
is me doing heroin.

1181
00:59:56,497 --> 00:59:57,731
You're not a smart woman.

1182
00:59:59,033 --> 00:59:59,934
Uh.

1183
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:03,771
Fine, I don't think there's
any need for an insult.

1184
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:10,678
I'm sorry. I'm, I
didn't mean to insult you.

1185
01:00:11,979 --> 01:00:15,517
I was just questioning your
intelligence. That's all.

1186
01:00:18,953 --> 01:00:21,822
Ugh. That's a shame, Charlie,

1187
01:00:21,956 --> 01:00:24,225
because I really
feel like we were,

1188
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:27,428
we were making some
progress, but I'm so sorry.

1189
01:00:27,562 --> 01:00:30,599
I think maybe it's time

1190
01:00:30,731 --> 01:00:31,699
that you left.

1191
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:33,467
Yeah, great.

1192
01:00:33,602 --> 01:00:36,370
I been trying to do that
for like 10 minutes, so

1193
01:00:36,505 --> 01:00:37,606
it's cool with me.

1194
01:00:41,142 --> 01:00:44,445
Jess. Say hi to your cat, mate.

1195
01:00:48,249 --> 01:00:49,551
Good night, children.

1196
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:56,558
You just can't help people
that won't help themselves.

1197
01:00:58,259 --> 01:01:00,227
It's a really big
lesson tonight, guys.

1198
01:01:01,162 --> 01:01:03,831
Let's regroup.

1199
01:01:10,304 --> 01:01:11,038
Hey.

1200
01:01:15,776 --> 01:01:16,511
Can we talk?

1201
01:01:28,255 --> 01:01:30,324
Fuck, Charlie, I'm so sorry.

1202
01:01:32,259 --> 01:01:33,562
Why did you tell him?

1203
01:01:34,061 --> 01:01:35,062
I didn't want to.

1204
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:38,766
He beat it out of me,
saw the texts. I'm sorry.

1205
01:01:38,899 --> 01:01:39,800
Had to.

1206
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:46,173
You know he
slapped me with it.

1207
01:01:48,943 --> 01:01:51,212
His penis, he
slapped me with it.

1208
01:01:52,581 --> 01:01:53,881
What?

1209
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:56,116
He beat the shit out of
me, and he made me crawl over

1210
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,953
to it and then he
was like, "look at it".

1211
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,557
And you know what? It
looked right back at me.

1212
01:02:03,224 --> 01:02:07,161
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1213
01:02:07,828 --> 01:02:10,798
You're laughing,
okay. Fuck you.

1214
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,567
-I'm sorry.

1215
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,836
You've got really
shitty taste in men.

1216
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:17,404
Not all men.

1217
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:20,474
Come on.

1218
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:23,578
You've gone from abusive
porn star to junkie bum.

1219
01:02:23,712 --> 01:02:24,912
You're not a bum.

1220
01:02:28,249 --> 01:02:30,985
Look at me. What have I got?

1221
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:34,989
Got no money. Got no friends.

1222
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:38,025
I have a job. Do have a job.

1223
01:02:38,526 --> 01:02:40,528
Makes me wanna kill myself
every time I clock in.

1224
01:02:42,697 --> 01:02:43,397
What have I got?

1225
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:45,833
You got me.

1226
01:02:52,373 --> 01:02:56,076
Did you, uh, did you
tell him about the plan?

1227
01:02:56,844 --> 01:02:57,712
No.

1228
01:02:57,845 --> 01:02:58,846
No?

1229
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:00,247
Good.

1230
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,083
Because I don't
just wanna rob him,

1231
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:05,419
I wanna fucking kill him.

1232
01:03:08,489 --> 01:03:10,592
So it's pretty much
still the exact same plan,

1233
01:03:10,725 --> 01:03:11,959
just have a different ending.

1234
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:13,460
So we're not gonna
rob him anymore?

1235
01:03:13,595 --> 01:03:16,631
What? Of course we're gonna
rob him. You're not listening.

1236
01:03:16,765 --> 01:03:19,099
It's just that this time
I'm gonna use the gun

1237
01:03:19,233 --> 01:03:21,302
and I'm gonna blow his
fucking brains out.

1238
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:24,438
So you shoot him in the head?

1239
01:03:25,306 --> 01:03:27,509
Yes, I'm gonna
shoot him in the head.

1240
01:03:27,642 --> 01:03:28,942
Why, where were you
thinking of shooting him?

1241
01:03:29,076 --> 01:03:31,445
Don't know, the head just
seems kinda harsh, isn't it?

1242
01:03:31,579 --> 01:03:33,715
Harsh? Look at your face.

1243
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:36,183
Look at my face. This guy
deserves fucking harsh.

1244
01:03:36,317 --> 01:03:37,752
The guy's lucky I don't fucking

1245
01:03:38,653 --> 01:03:39,920
cut his dick off or something.

1246
01:03:42,691 --> 01:03:44,091
Ooh.

1247
01:03:44,659 --> 01:03:45,760
Let's do that.

1248
01:03:45,893 --> 01:03:47,428
I was joking. I
was, that was a joke.

1249
01:03:47,562 --> 01:03:49,229
You're, that's not a joke face.

1250
01:03:49,897 --> 01:03:51,065
No, obviously not.

1251
01:03:51,198 --> 01:03:53,901
No.
Shoot him in the head then.

1252
01:03:57,037 --> 01:03:58,640
So you actually wanna do this?

1253
01:04:00,441 --> 01:04:01,108
Yeah.

1254
01:04:01,241 --> 01:04:02,476
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1255
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:03,477
Okay.

1256
01:04:05,045 --> 01:04:05,946
To justice.

1257
01:04:07,582 --> 01:04:08,449
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

1258
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:09,450
Okay.

1259
01:04:09,584 --> 01:04:10,084
I'll just cheers you.

1260
01:04:10,217 --> 01:04:10,785
It felt right.

1261
01:05:12,781 --> 01:05:13,615
I love you.

1262
01:05:21,689 --> 01:05:23,090
Who the fuck is that?

1263
01:05:24,826 --> 01:05:26,661
I don't know. I don't know.

1264
01:05:27,327 --> 01:05:28,395
Get the gun.

1265
01:05:35,002 --> 01:05:35,737
Who is it?

1266
01:05:51,485 --> 01:05:52,486
Freeze!

1267
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:53,387
Fucking hell!

1268
01:05:53,521 --> 01:05:54,889
Oh fuck, Mark, I'm so sorry.

1269
01:05:55,022 --> 01:05:56,089
I just pissed my pants!

1270
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:58,225
Look at that, proper
pissed myself.

1271
01:05:58,358 --> 01:06:00,929
Yeah. You, do you
want some new trousers?

1272
01:06:01,061 --> 01:06:01,729
Come in.

1273
01:06:01,863 --> 01:06:03,096
Why have you got a gun?

1274
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:06,033
Why is it so big?

1275
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:10,137
Are these really all you have?

1276
01:06:11,506 --> 01:06:13,541
Yeah, everything
else was dirty.

1277
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:15,710
Great, great.

1278
01:06:16,544 --> 01:06:17,879
Great.

1279
01:06:18,045 --> 01:06:19,948
So do you wanna talk
about what happened or?

1280
01:06:21,081 --> 01:06:22,750
With what?

1281
01:06:22,884 --> 01:06:24,084
With what, with what?

1282
01:06:24,218 --> 01:06:27,120
With the whole, the whole
pointing a gun in my face.

1283
01:06:27,254 --> 01:06:28,790
You know, me pissing my pants.

1284
01:06:28,923 --> 01:06:29,624
Yeah, that.

1285
01:06:29,757 --> 01:06:30,491
Yeah, that.

1286
01:06:31,759 --> 01:06:34,228
Yeah, well, it's a,
it's a funny story.

1287
01:06:36,497 --> 01:06:38,867
Um, I'm actually babysitting it.

1288
01:06:39,066 --> 01:06:40,535
It's not my, it
doesn't belong to me.

1289
01:06:40,668 --> 01:06:41,870
That's not funny.

1290
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:42,770
What?

1291
01:06:43,403 --> 01:06:45,205
Well, you said funny story.
That's not a funny story.

1292
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:46,908
It's barely even a story.

1293
01:06:47,074 --> 01:06:50,477
I mean, who the fuck
babysits a gun? It's stupid.

1294
01:06:50,612 --> 01:06:52,847
Whose gun is it anyway?
I'm Mark, by the way.

1295
01:06:52,981 --> 01:06:54,081
Oh yeah, so Mark, this is--

1296
01:06:54,181 --> 01:06:56,450
Oh, oh oh, oh oh oh.

1297
01:06:56,584 --> 01:06:59,721
The, uh, sex addict.

1298
01:06:59,854 --> 01:07:01,589
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1299
01:07:01,723 --> 01:07:02,456
You told him that?

1300
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:03,758
- Addict.

1301
01:07:03,892 --> 01:07:05,793
It just
came up really briefly.

1302
01:07:05,927 --> 01:07:07,094
Nice.

1303
01:07:07,529 --> 01:07:08,630
You know I can see you?

1304
01:07:08,763 --> 01:07:10,665
Don't worry about
the gun thing.

1305
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:14,101
She, she's left, she's left me.

1306
01:07:14,234 --> 01:07:15,168
Who has?

1307
01:07:15,302 --> 01:07:17,304
My bastard wife,
she fucking left me.

1308
01:07:17,437 --> 01:07:20,307
Hey, that's, that's
fantastic news.

1309
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,475
That's exactly what you wanted.

1310
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:22,109
I didn't want that.

1311
01:07:22,242 --> 01:07:23,176
Yes, you did.

1312
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:24,612
No, no no, I
wanted to leave her.

1313
01:07:24,746 --> 01:07:26,781
But the fucking bitch
has beaten me to it.

1314
01:07:26,915 --> 01:07:28,248
Said she wasn't
happy or something.

1315
01:07:28,382 --> 01:07:29,517
I wasn't fucking listening.

1316
01:07:29,651 --> 01:07:31,318
Yeah, Mark, you weren't happy.

1317
01:07:31,451 --> 01:07:34,022
I know. Do you
understand what I'm saying?

1318
01:07:34,154 --> 01:07:37,792
Do you know, seven years.
Seven, seven, seven years.

1319
01:07:37,926 --> 01:07:40,460
And then, then, then, see ya.

1320
01:07:40,595 --> 01:07:41,563
Like, like it's nothing.

1321
01:07:41,696 --> 01:07:43,598
Like it's, like
it's not my house,

1322
01:07:43,731 --> 01:07:45,332
and it's my fucking house.

1323
01:07:45,465 --> 01:07:46,400
Watch the beer.

1324
01:07:46,534 --> 01:07:48,135
And she's so
like smug about it.

1325
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:50,738
It's like she
didn't give a shit about it.

1326
01:07:50,872 --> 01:07:51,338
Do you know what I mean?

1327
01:07:51,471 --> 01:07:52,774
Mark, Mark.

1328
01:07:52,907 --> 01:07:54,408
You didn't give a shit.

1329
01:07:54,542 --> 01:07:56,811
Of course I give a shit!
Of course I give a shit!

1330
01:07:56,945 --> 01:07:58,145
Seriously, the carpet.

1331
01:07:58,245 --> 01:08:00,414
Do you know what?
Fuck the fucking carpet.

1332
01:08:00,548 --> 01:08:02,316
Fuck the fucking carpet.

1333
01:08:02,449 --> 01:08:04,919
Fuck off the fucking carpet!

1334
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:06,688
Mark!

1335
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:08,155
Fucking carpet!

1336
01:08:13,027 --> 01:08:15,730
Wow, I'm so sorry about that.
That's not--

1337
01:08:16,263 --> 01:08:17,999
Yes, that--

1338
01:08:18,165 --> 01:08:19,734
Sorry about that.

1339
01:08:19,867 --> 01:08:21,603
Have you got a flannel
or a tea towel or?

1340
01:08:21,736 --> 01:08:23,170
I'll clean it up right now.

1341
01:08:23,303 --> 01:08:24,271
Don't worry about it.

1342
01:08:32,947 --> 01:08:33,715
You okay?

1343
01:08:40,521 --> 01:08:41,623
Do you still love her?

1344
01:08:44,257 --> 01:08:46,794
Then maybe you need to do
something to show her that.

1345
01:08:47,095 --> 01:08:50,197
Like, like buy her some flowers,

1346
01:08:50,297 --> 01:08:53,500
or maybe like take her out
for a dinner or something.

1347
01:08:53,635 --> 01:08:57,204
And, uh, just something to make,

1348
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:00,440
make, make her realise
that you care still.

1349
01:09:01,843 --> 01:09:04,211
Oh, maybe, yeah.

1350
01:09:06,346 --> 01:09:08,816
Oh for fuck sake.

1351
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:11,886
Can you stop being such
a whiny little bitch?

1352
01:09:13,253 --> 01:09:14,689
You don't love her.

1353
01:09:15,389 --> 01:09:18,026
You're just fucked off
because she left you.

1354
01:09:18,225 --> 01:09:20,662
Makes you feel
small and pathetic,

1355
01:09:21,062 --> 01:09:22,997
like you're not a proper man.

1356
01:09:23,131 --> 01:09:24,364
You're looking at
this the wrong way.

1357
01:09:24,498 --> 01:09:25,867
You need to look
at the positives.

1358
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,135
Positives.

1359
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:30,370
-Yeah. I mean,
you're okay looking.

1360
01:09:31,005 --> 01:09:32,840
I bet you got a few
quid in your pocket.

1361
01:09:32,974 --> 01:09:35,710
Yeah, I mean. I do okay.

1362
01:09:35,843 --> 01:09:38,746
Right, so with an
okay face and money,

1363
01:09:39,714 --> 01:09:41,883
you could probably bang
some half-decent women.

1364
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:46,486
It's not your heart that's
hurting. It's your pride.

1365
01:09:49,791 --> 01:09:52,492
Pretty fucking deep.

1366
01:09:52,627 --> 01:09:55,262
It's not deep.
It's just honest.

1367
01:09:56,664 --> 01:09:58,265
It's late. I'm tired.

1368
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:00,535
Charlie, can you hurry up?

1369
01:10:00,668 --> 01:10:02,269
Because I wanna come
before we go to sleep.

1370
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:06,206
Big day tomorrow. Nice
to meet you, Mark.

1371
01:10:06,339 --> 01:10:07,508
-Yeah, good night.

1372
01:10:18,586 --> 01:10:19,954
Marry her.

1373
01:10:52,019 --> 01:10:53,054
Oh fuck me!

1374
01:10:55,556 --> 01:10:57,324
What are you doing?

1375
01:10:57,457 --> 01:11:00,494
I, I, just, just,
just sleeping.

1376
01:11:00,628 --> 01:11:01,929
Why are you
sleeping on my toilet?

1377
01:11:02,063 --> 01:11:03,396
-I don't know.

1378
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:05,900
I mean, I must have just come
in to do a shit last night

1379
01:11:06,033 --> 01:11:07,400
and fell asleep on the--

1380
01:11:07,535 --> 01:11:08,335
What the fuck is all
the shouting about?

1381
01:11:08,401 --> 01:11:09,704
-Nothing.
-Morning.

1382
01:11:11,371 --> 01:11:12,439
Are you shitting?

1383
01:11:12,573 --> 01:11:16,110
Um, I don't, I don't
even know, to be honest.

1384
01:11:16,244 --> 01:11:17,645
For fuck sake, fucking gross.

1385
01:11:17,779 --> 01:11:19,113
Sorry, sorry.

1386
01:11:21,348 --> 01:11:23,483
Why the fuck have
you got a balaclava?

1387
01:11:23,618 --> 01:11:24,786
Yeah, that's the
important thing, isn't it?

1388
01:11:24,919 --> 01:11:26,486
Why are you sleeping
on my toilet?

1389
01:11:26,621 --> 01:11:28,156
Get the fuck out of my bathroom.

1390
01:11:28,355 --> 01:11:30,892
Yeah, uh, issue, um.

1391
01:11:31,692 --> 01:11:32,794
I've been sitting
here for hours.

1392
01:11:32,927 --> 01:11:34,394
I can't even feel my legs.

1393
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:36,264
Can you, I can't even
feel them at all.

1394
01:11:36,396 --> 01:11:37,364
Can you help me get--

1395
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:39,567
Can you?

1396
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:41,602
Ow, ow ow, owie!

1397
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:44,906
Okay, nice to meet you.

1398
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:47,374
That's enough.

1399
01:11:50,912 --> 01:11:51,846
Yeah.

1400
01:11:53,514 --> 01:11:56,184
You're not gonna put on
the piss trousers again?

1401
01:11:56,383 --> 01:11:58,886
Yeah, they'll be
dry. They'll be fine.

1402
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:00,788
Yeah, but the smell.

1403
01:12:01,622 --> 01:12:02,389
Oh, the smell?

1404
01:12:02,455 --> 01:12:03,791
Yeah.

1405
01:12:03,925 --> 01:12:06,127
Yeah.
Yeah, a little bit pissy still.

1406
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:08,896
But that's all right.
What are you gonna do?

1407
01:12:11,265 --> 01:12:13,768
Probably not gonna come
into work today, Mark.

1408
01:12:13,901 --> 01:12:16,804
Okay, yeah, I think that's,
think that's fair enough.

1409
01:12:17,705 --> 01:12:18,405
Yeah.

1410
01:12:20,473 --> 01:12:21,008
You're um,

1411
01:12:23,678 --> 01:12:25,713
you're not gonna do
anything, you know,

1412
01:12:25,847 --> 01:12:27,515
stupid, are you, Charles?

1413
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:31,052
What do you mean?

1414
01:12:31,185 --> 01:12:32,887
The whole guns
and balaclavas thing

1415
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,890
doesn't exactly say sensible.

1416
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:39,894
And heroin does?

1417
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:41,963
Good point.

1418
01:12:43,097 --> 01:12:43,865
Yeah.

1419
01:12:46,133 --> 01:12:48,102
It's just that, you
know, I, I like you, man.

1420
01:12:48,236 --> 01:12:50,437
You're a good guy.

1421
01:12:53,307 --> 01:12:54,542
Thanks, Mark.

1422
01:12:54,675 --> 01:12:56,210
-Yeah.

1423
01:12:56,344 --> 01:12:57,345
Right.

1424
01:12:58,045 --> 01:13:00,348
Mark, your, your coat?

1425
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,481
-Yeah.

1426
01:13:01,616 --> 01:13:03,618
Can I borrow that
for a couple of days?

1427
01:13:04,252 --> 01:13:07,255
Um, yeah, yeah.
Fits you, yeah.

1428
01:13:07,922 --> 01:13:09,090
-Thanks.

1429
01:13:09,223 --> 01:13:10,992
You know what? You can,
you can keep that one.

1430
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:12,059
-Yeah?

1431
01:13:12,193 --> 01:13:13,961
Yeah. Yeah, thanks
for having me.

1432
01:13:15,096 --> 01:13:16,264
No, thanks for coming.

1433
01:13:16,463 --> 01:13:18,532
Same time next
week or something.

1434
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:19,600
-Yeah, maybe.

1435
01:13:19,734 --> 01:13:21,602
-All right, see ya.

1436
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:29,777
Hm.

1437
01:13:33,114 --> 01:13:36,483
Well, what do you think?
Big enough to hide a musket?

1438
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:37,618
I love it.

1439
01:13:38,552 --> 01:13:39,654
So I have today off.

1440
01:13:39,787 --> 01:13:41,622
Oh, really?

1441
01:13:41,756 --> 01:13:43,624
Mm-hm. What do you wanna do?

1442
01:13:54,501 --> 01:13:55,369
Charlie.

1443
01:13:57,071 --> 01:14:00,508
You need to stop
with the sex stuff.

1444
01:14:01,575 --> 01:14:02,777
Why?

1445
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:06,514
You don't need to go into
so much detail every time.

1446
01:14:07,281 --> 01:14:08,916
It's an important
part of the story.

1447
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:14,288
How is you having sex an
important part of the story?

1448
01:14:14,422 --> 01:14:19,026
Surely the whole planning a
murder is the important part.

1449
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,562
Well, it's a
subplot, isn't it?

1450
01:14:21,696 --> 01:14:22,930
It's character development.

1451
01:14:23,064 --> 01:14:26,934
These aren't
characters, Charlie.

1452
01:14:27,068 --> 01:14:30,771
This isn't a made-up story.
This is your life, isn't it?

1453
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,675
Or is this all
some sort of joke?

1454
01:14:34,809 --> 01:14:36,677
Glad to see you think
my life's a joke, Doc.

1455
01:14:36,811 --> 01:14:37,645
Unbelievable.

1456
01:14:37,778 --> 01:14:39,280
I need a drink.

1457
01:14:51,425 --> 01:14:52,560
Can I get one of those?

1458
01:14:57,898 --> 01:14:59,000
So should I--

1459
01:14:59,433 --> 01:14:59,934
Go ahead.

1460
01:15:00,067 --> 01:15:01,135
Okay, great.

1461
01:15:01,268 --> 01:15:02,636
Supposed to get to
Jimmy's place by 1:00 AM,

1462
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:04,705
on the dot, not a minute later.

1463
01:15:11,078 --> 01:15:12,980
Oh banger, banger.

1464
01:16:15,943 --> 01:16:17,945
Oh fuck, fuck
I'm gonna be late.

1465
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:02,349
Shh.

1466
01:18:03,884 --> 01:18:05,019
Where is he?

1467
01:18:05,152 --> 01:18:06,420
He's in there. You're late.

1468
01:18:06,555 --> 01:18:10,659
Yeah, I know.
Traffic was pretty bad.

1469
01:18:10,791 --> 01:18:12,193
Traffic, at 1:00 AM?

1470
01:18:12,927 --> 01:18:13,961
Yeah.

1471
01:18:14,094 --> 01:18:14,895
For fuck sake,
where's the balaclava?

1472
01:18:15,029 --> 01:18:15,829
Yeah.

1473
01:18:21,769 --> 01:18:24,071
Wait. Do we even
need to wear these?

1474
01:18:24,205 --> 01:18:25,372
We're gonna kill him.

1475
01:18:25,507 --> 01:18:27,542
Yeah, absolutely not, no.

1476
01:18:28,776 --> 01:18:30,110
Good thinking.

1477
01:18:30,244 --> 01:18:31,111
Very warm.

1478
01:18:31,245 --> 01:18:32,046
Shh, shh.

1479
01:18:32,681 --> 01:18:34,815
Okay. Go.

1480
01:18:49,797 --> 01:18:51,031
Why is he fucking naked?

1481
01:18:51,165 --> 01:18:53,801
He always sleep naked.

1482
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:55,035
Just don't look at it.

1483
01:18:55,169 --> 01:18:57,204
Look at it? It's
looking at me again.

1484
01:18:57,338 --> 01:18:58,973
Shut up. Let me get the money.

1485
01:18:59,106 --> 01:18:59,708
Kill him.

1486
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,709
Fine.

1487
01:19:14,989 --> 01:19:15,823
Fuck it.

1488
01:19:20,828 --> 01:19:21,730
Will you hurry the fuck up?

1489
01:19:21,862 --> 01:19:22,731
Shh.

1490
01:19:35,476 --> 01:19:37,278
What are you waiting
for? Shoot him.

1491
01:19:40,281 --> 01:19:41,650
I can't do it.

1492
01:19:41,849 --> 01:19:43,652
You can't do it?

1493
01:19:43,851 --> 01:19:44,586
I can't do this.

1494
01:19:47,689 --> 01:19:49,123
Wait, where the
fuck are you going?

1495
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:51,392
What the fuck are you doing?

1496
01:19:51,526 --> 01:19:52,426
I can't breathe.

1497
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:53,528
What?

1498
01:19:53,662 --> 01:19:54,729
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

1499
01:19:54,862 --> 01:19:55,563
Are you fucking serious?

1500
01:19:55,697 --> 01:19:56,731
Go in there.

1501
01:19:56,864 --> 01:19:58,633
-Go in there!
-Sorry, sorry.

1502
01:19:58,767 --> 01:19:59,734
Just breathe.
Just breathe.

1503
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:12,046
Hello, Hedgehog.

1504
01:20:15,049 --> 01:20:16,417
Jimmy, no no, no no no.

1505
01:20:17,519 --> 01:20:19,253
Get off him, Jimmy.
What the fuck?

1506
01:20:20,722 --> 01:20:21,388
Get off him!

1507
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:26,795
Get off him, Jimmy!

1508
01:20:28,062 --> 01:20:29,830
You think you can rob me?

1509
01:20:29,963 --> 01:20:33,167
You come in my house, you
try and fucking rob me?

1510
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,442
Get off him, Jimmy.

1511
01:20:43,745 --> 01:20:44,945
Baby.

1512
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:48,015
I said get the
fuck off him, Jimmy!

1513
01:20:57,157 --> 01:20:58,526
You okay, Charlie?

1514
01:21:01,395 --> 01:21:02,764
Get on your knees.

1515
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:06,033
What are you
gonna do, shoot me?

1516
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:08,168
Get the fuck on your knees!

1517
01:21:21,348 --> 01:21:23,984
What did I ever do to you, hm?

1518
01:21:34,962 --> 01:21:36,631
I told you
it was a good story.

1519
01:21:39,266 --> 01:21:43,838
You're aware I now have
to inform the authorities?

1520
01:21:43,971 --> 01:21:47,374
I mean, you committed a murder.

1521
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:51,780
Would we really
call it a murder?

1522
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:54,248
You knowingly planned
to kill someone, yes.

1523
01:21:54,381 --> 01:21:55,784
We would call that a murder.

1524
01:21:55,983 --> 01:22:00,120
Yeah, but don't you
think that some people,

1525
01:22:00,254 --> 01:22:03,658
some people just deserve to die?

1526
01:22:06,026 --> 01:22:07,428
You're basically insane.

1527
01:22:07,562 --> 01:22:09,229
Is that the same
thing as crazy?

1528
01:22:09,363 --> 01:22:10,431
Because that seems a
little bit more harsh.

1529
01:22:10,565 --> 01:22:11,699
I'm calling the police.

1530
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:12,767
No, we haven't even
gotten to the real reason

1531
01:22:12,901 --> 01:22:14,301
as to why I'm here yet.

1532
01:22:14,435 --> 01:22:15,570
What are you talking about?

1533
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:16,604
The twist. Every story
needs a twist, right?

1534
01:22:16,738 --> 01:22:18,071
The twist.

1535
01:22:18,205 --> 01:22:20,307
Yeah, that last part where
the audience just go, Fuck me!

1536
01:22:20,441 --> 01:22:21,175
Fuck me?

1537
01:22:21,308 --> 01:22:22,276
Yeah, fuck you, indeed, Doc.

1538
01:22:22,409 --> 01:22:23,611
Don't dial another
fucking number.

1539
01:22:29,517 --> 01:22:31,653
Do you remember that
story she told me in bed?

1540
01:22:32,352 --> 01:22:34,321
About the doctor,
used to touch her

1541
01:22:34,455 --> 01:22:35,590
when she was a little kid?

1542
01:22:38,058 --> 01:22:39,059
It was you, wasn't it?

1543
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,395
Hm?

1544
01:22:41,529 --> 01:22:43,464
You see, after we killed Jimmy

1545
01:22:43,598 --> 01:22:45,432
and seemingly got away with it,

1546
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:47,635
we put our heads
together and we thought,

1547
01:22:47,769 --> 01:22:51,071
who else in our lives
has fucked us over?

1548
01:22:51,205 --> 01:22:53,307
You were the top of her list.

1549
01:22:54,943 --> 01:22:57,077
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1550
01:22:57,211 --> 01:22:59,112
Really? Really?

1551
01:22:59,246 --> 01:23:00,314
Funny that.

1552
01:23:05,352 --> 01:23:06,754
Made up with the
American, by the way.

1553
01:23:08,422 --> 01:23:09,824
You know what I find funny?

1554
01:23:10,859 --> 01:23:13,093
Is that you sit there every day,

1555
01:23:13,227 --> 01:23:15,730
listen to people's
problems, you jot it down

1556
01:23:15,864 --> 01:23:18,499
in our little notepad
and then you go home

1557
01:23:18,633 --> 01:23:23,303
to Mr. Therapist, who
I'm assuming has no idea

1558
01:23:23,437 --> 01:23:25,707
that what really turns you on

1559
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,342
is raping little girls.

1560
01:23:31,513 --> 01:23:34,214
You're delusional, Charlie.

1561
01:23:35,182 --> 01:23:37,217
You have serious
mental health issues.

1562
01:23:39,821 --> 01:23:41,221
Then why have you
stopped dialing?

1563
01:23:44,893 --> 01:23:45,793
Hm?

1564
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:53,433
There you go.

1565
01:23:56,671 --> 01:23:57,471
What do you want?

1566
01:23:59,106 --> 01:24:00,307
What's the time?

1567
01:24:04,311 --> 01:24:05,747
Just gone one.

1568
01:24:07,114 --> 01:24:07,949
Perfect.

1569
01:24:13,253 --> 01:24:15,523
Um, I think that's for you.

1570
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:18,358
Go on.

1571
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:35,275
Hi, Doc.

1572
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:39,581
Bye, Doc.

1573
01:24:57,899 --> 01:25:01,335
Oh my God. I think I'm
getting used to that. Well done.

1574
01:25:01,468 --> 01:25:02,570
Hey, guys.

1575
01:25:03,638 --> 01:25:06,173
Mark, what the fuck
are you doing here?

1576
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:07,207
Don't shoot!

1577
01:25:08,275 --> 01:25:10,545
We're in, we're in
couples therapy.

1578
01:25:10,678 --> 01:25:12,446
This is my wife, by the way.

1579
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:15,349
Linda, Charlie. Charlie, Linda.

1580
01:25:16,183 --> 01:25:17,351
Hi.

1581
01:25:17,484 --> 01:25:19,020
-Hi, Linda.
-Hi.

1582
01:25:19,186 --> 01:25:21,556
-Yeah, turns out no other
women wanted to fuck me, so.

1583
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:23,958
How did you not
see them when you...

1584
01:25:24,092 --> 01:25:25,459
I don't know.

1585
01:25:25,593 --> 01:25:26,961
I just walked in, knocked on
the door. It went so quickly.

1586
01:25:27,095 --> 01:25:28,029
- You guys didn't even say anything.
-  -Fuck me!

1587
01:25:28,195 --> 01:25:30,064
No, no, she's
right. We didn't.

1588
01:25:30,197 --> 01:25:31,331
I think it was the shock.
It all happened so fast.

1589
01:25:31,465 --> 01:25:33,467
Is she dead in there?

1590
01:25:33,601 --> 01:25:34,802
Yes!

1591
01:25:34,936 --> 01:25:35,737
Right.

1592
01:25:37,572 --> 01:25:38,940
Right.

1593
01:25:39,073 --> 01:25:41,308
You can put your
hands down, by the way.

1594
01:25:41,441 --> 01:25:42,476
All right, yeah.

1595
01:25:44,779 --> 01:25:46,614
Whew, so.

1596
01:25:48,348 --> 01:25:52,352
So what, what, what do we
do now? What do we do, now?

1597
01:25:54,722 --> 01:25:55,690
I don't know. I don't know.

1598
01:25:55,823 --> 01:25:56,456
Baby, what do we do?

1599
01:25:56,591 --> 01:25:57,725
I have no idea.

1600
01:25:57,859 --> 01:25:59,426
I mean, there's two ways
we could go about this.

1601
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,962
We could shoot them.

1602
01:26:01,095 --> 01:26:02,362
No, no.

1603
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,632
That's one option. Or?

1604
01:26:04,766 --> 01:26:07,434
We let them go and hope that
they'll not telltale tits.

1605
01:26:09,103 --> 01:26:10,337
What's it gonna be, Mark?

1606
01:26:11,973 --> 01:26:13,407
Yeah, I like, like
the second one more.

1607
01:26:13,541 --> 01:26:15,076
Yeah? Linda?

1608
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:18,378
Second one please.

1609
01:26:18,513 --> 01:26:19,346
Second one.

1610
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:21,983
Okay, great.

1611
01:26:22,116 --> 01:26:23,250
Great.

1612
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:25,920
This is what you say
when the police come.

1613
01:26:26,054 --> 01:26:27,655
You opened the door to
the doctor's office,

1614
01:26:27,789 --> 01:26:29,624
and that is when
you found her dead.

1615
01:26:29,757 --> 01:26:31,324
And then you immediately
called the police.

1616
01:26:31,458 --> 01:26:33,427
You immediately
called the police.

1617
01:26:33,561 --> 01:26:34,562
-Yep.
-Yeah?

1618
01:26:34,696 --> 01:26:35,462
Where's my phone? Here.

1619
01:26:35,596 --> 01:26:36,864
Killers were long gone.

1620
01:26:36,998 --> 01:26:38,132
Mm-hm.

1621
01:26:38,265 --> 01:26:39,266
Is that clear?

1622
01:26:39,366 --> 01:26:41,669
Crystal clear,
yes. Crystal clear.

1623
01:26:42,637 --> 01:26:44,539
Well, we should go.

1624
01:26:44,672 --> 01:26:45,272
Yeah.

1625
01:26:47,274 --> 01:26:51,012
You're a good guy, too, Mark.
Thanks for everything, mate.

1626
01:26:53,715 --> 01:26:54,749
Thanks, man.

1627
01:27:08,361 --> 01:27:10,198
Ah, so?

1628
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:12,967
So.

1629
01:27:13,101 --> 01:27:14,035
Where to now?

1630
01:27:14,702 --> 01:27:15,970
Mexico?

1631
01:27:16,104 --> 01:27:17,304
Mexico.

1632
01:27:17,437 --> 01:27:18,606
Mexico. Mexico.

1633
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:20,474
-Mexico!
-Mexico!

1634
01:27:20,608 --> 01:27:22,610
Mexico! Woo!

1635
01:27:29,984 --> 01:27:32,153
You should probably
put that away now.

1636
01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:33,888
The police will
probably see that.

1637
01:27:40,494 --> 01:27:41,929
What are you doing?

1638
01:27:44,364 --> 01:27:45,867
What the fuck are you doing?

1639
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,202
Don't.

1640
01:27:49,537 --> 01:27:50,772
Fuck off.

1641
01:27:50,905 --> 01:27:52,140
Stop the car, Charlie.

1642
01:27:52,573 --> 01:27:53,241
What do you mean stop the car?

1643
01:27:53,373 --> 01:27:54,341
Stop the car, Charlie.

1644
01:27:54,407 --> 01:27:55,777
I'm not stop, I'm gonna--

1645
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:57,578
Stop the fucking car, Charlie!

1646
01:28:06,419 --> 01:28:07,255
What?

1647
01:28:07,387 --> 01:28:09,991
I'm fucking with you.

1648
01:28:10,124 --> 01:28:11,592
I nearly shit myself then.

1649
01:28:11,726 --> 01:28:13,426
-You were afraid.
-Fuck me!

1650
01:28:13,561 --> 01:28:14,595
Fucking hell.

1651
01:28:14,729 --> 01:28:16,764
You are another
breed. Fucking hell.

1652
01:28:16,898 --> 01:28:20,668
Ah, why would I shoot
you? I fucking love you.

1653
01:28:25,606 --> 01:28:28,142
Think you just, you
just said you love me.

1654
01:28:29,043 --> 01:28:29,844
Yeah.

1655
01:28:35,049 --> 01:28:36,383
Are you crying?

1656
01:28:36,751 --> 01:28:39,620
Mm, mm-mm . No.

1657
01:28:39,754 --> 01:28:40,922
Oh my God, you're crying.

1658
01:28:41,055 --> 01:28:43,456
I'm not, you are. I'm not.

1659
01:28:43,591 --> 01:28:46,493
You're a
fucking pussy, Charlie.

1660
01:28:49,396 --> 01:28:50,598
It's just that nobody's
ever said that to me before.

1661
01:28:50,731 --> 01:28:52,867
Oh my God, shut
up. I love this song.

1662
01:28:56,737 --> 01:28:57,772
Not quite.

1663
01:29:00,808 --> 01:29:02,677
This is half leather.
