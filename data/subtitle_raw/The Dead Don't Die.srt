00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:38,068
Yuck.

3
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,335
The fire's still warm.

4
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:50,968
Is that you, Hermit Bob?

5
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:54,399
We kinda can see you.

6
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:56,999
Farmer Miller says
you might have stole

7
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,566
one of his chickens.

8
00:01:58,568 --> 00:02:01,235
That happens to be
against the law.

9
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:06,899
Now, I'm hoping that it was
a fox that did that.

10
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:10,168
Up your hole
with a wooden pole, Cliff.

11
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:19,366
That also happens to be
against the law.

12
00:02:19,368 --> 00:02:21,801
Should we take him in?

13
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:26,932
Where'd he go?

14
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:29,001
I don't know.

15
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:37,068
I don't see him.

16
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:43,366
Uh, we're gonna go back
to town now...

17
00:02:43,368 --> 00:02:45,366
Hermit Bob.

18
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:48,832
Don't break any more laws.

19
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,867
Just calm down.

20
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:09,266

I mean...

43
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,809
he fired a weapon
at police officers.

44
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:55,107
Yeah, I don't know.

45
00:05:55,109 --> 00:05:57,809
I doubt he even stole
that chicken.

46
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:03,343
Farmer Miller
is such an asshole.

47
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:07,308
I've known Bob
since junior high.

48
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,007
Oh, wow.

49
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:12,241
That must have been
like 50 years ago.

50
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:15,107
Yeah, it was.

51
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:17,940
You know, Bob's been out there
for years,

52
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:19,441
eating squirrels and bugs,

53
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:23,441
and he never hurt anyone
that I ever heard of.

54
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:26,076
Well, he is kind of unusual.

55
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,174
Is it already 20 after 8:00?

56
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:35,441
Shouldn't it be
getting dark by now?

57
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:37,341
Yeah, this
daylight savings thing

58
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:39,374
is all out of whack lately.

59
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,410
Damn it.

60
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:48,274
My watch stopped.

61
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:50,376
Or is broken or something.

62
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:56,074
Yeah, something weird's
going on.

63
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:59,076
Yeah. Weird.

64
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,909
Yeah, this isn't gonna
end well, Cliff.

65
00:07:31,176 --> 00:07:34,441
The ant colonies.

66
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:38,209
All jacked up like it was
the end of the world.

67
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:55,907
Hey, Ronnie,
you want to swing by the diner,

68
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,207
get some doughnuts, coffee?

69
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:02,074
Um... no, thanks.

70
00:08:02,076 --> 00:08:05,074
It seems late
for coffee and doughnuts.

71
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:07,074
I guess so.

72
00:08:07,076 --> 00:08:09,074
This is home base.

73
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:10,809
Are you guys reading me?
Over.

74
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:15,341
- Hey, Mindy.
- You guys okay out there?

75
00:08:15,343 --> 00:08:18,041
Yeah, we're just, uh,
cruising a bit

76
00:08:18,043 --> 00:08:20,308
before we swing on back.

77
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,174
Uh, you need anything?

78
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:24,974
We could, uh, run by the diner,

79
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:27,374
pick you up
some coffee and doughnuts.

80
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:29,074
Negative. Thanks.

81
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,474
There is something strange
going on, though.

82
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:33,641
Have you guys, by any chance,
noticed that the...

83
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:36,007
...and the daylight and the...

84
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:37,940
I think the news report...

85
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:41,107
Hello, hello.

86
00:08:41,109 --> 00:08:43,241
Shit. We lost her.

88
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:56,408
That's funny.

89
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,410
It's completely dead.

90
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:03,041
And it was fully charged.

91
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,007

to the civilian radio?

00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:07,874

Be out shortly, Frank.

122
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,874

123
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:07,107
Would you mind turning off
that goddamn music?

124
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:09,141
Fucking Sturgill Simpson.

125
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:11,410
Sure thing.

126
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:18,341
So, Frank,
what makes you so sure

127
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:22,074
it's Hermit Bob
who stole your chicken?

128
00:11:22,076 --> 00:11:24,641
Well, who the hell else
could it be?

129
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,940
That goddamn hairy lunatic,

130
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:30,174
living out there
all these years like a caveman.

131
00:11:30,176 --> 00:11:32,308
Like some kind of ghost.

132
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,207
Might as well be Amish.

133
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:38,207
Maybe it was a... a fox, Frank.

134
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:41,107
Um, I don't think
Bob ever hurt anybody.

135
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:44,374
Yeah, well, tell that
to my fucking chickens.

136
00:11:44,376 --> 00:11:47,940
Fox, my ass.

137
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:49,641
Here you go, Frank.

138
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:53,074
Want me to put that
in a to-go cup for you?

139
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:56,174
Nah, I can't drink
any more of that stuff.

140
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:58,376
It's too damn black for me.

141
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:05,143
I meant it's too strong.

142
00:12:12,443 --> 00:12:14,207
Take care, Frank.

143
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:16,441
Yeah.

144
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:18,641
This special report:

145
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:21,174
These activities
could possibly be affecting

146
00:12:21,176 --> 00:12:23,274
the Earth's rotation
on its axis.

147
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,341
Scientists say
even the slightest change

148
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:27,907
in this balance
may already be causing

149
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:31,207
a dramatic change
in our usual hours of daylight.

150
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,007
Meanwhile,
government officials,

151
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:36,107
as well as the heads of
the energy companies involved,

152
00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:38,641
say the recent extensive
polar fracking

153
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:42,207
has had no discernible
consequences whatsoever.

154
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:44,474
Here's what
the energy secretary had to say

155
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:46,974
in this evening's
press conference.

156
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:50,308
Listen, these
alarmists are dangerous liars.

157
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,141
Let's not believe something

158
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:55,441
just because one so-called
scientist says it's true.

159
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:58,341
Polar fracking has created
fantastic jobs,

160
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:01,007
big profits and energy
for our great country.

161
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:02,909
Let's not forget our priori...

162
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:06,141
What you think, Fern?

163
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:08,207
I don't know, Hank.

164
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:11,207
Shouldn't it be
getting dark out?

165
00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:21,107
So,
you can see from this diagram

166
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:24,974
that if the Earth is pulled
even slightly off its axis,

167
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:27,041
the repercussions
could be extreme.

168
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:29,141
Coming up
in the next segment...

169
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,007
Holy shit, man, this is crazy.

170
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:36,207
A change in the Earth's
rotation or its spin rate?

171
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:38,207
That'd be catastrophic,
for sure.

172
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,274
All the cycles of the biosphere
would be affected.

173
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:44,107
The natural cycles of sunlight
would be disrupted,

174
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:46,074
plants wouldn't grow,
wind patterns would change,

175
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,107
and tectonic activity...

176
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:50,207
Forget about it.

177
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,376
The polar caps shifting
would mean...

178
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,241
I don't want to say.

179
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:59,074
Total planetary destruction.

180
00:13:59,076 --> 00:14:01,209
For real?

181
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,408
Shut up.

182
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:10,940
Okay, time's up, girls.

183
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:12,641
Way up.

184
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:16,874
Well, if it isn't Geronimo
on the girls' floor again.

185
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:18,474
Do you want to be a girl,
Geronimo?

186
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:20,241
No.

187
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:24,041
Well, then get back
to the boys' section... now.

188
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:26,441
Dennis.

189
00:14:26,443 --> 00:14:30,274
Can you please escort Geronimo
back to the boys' section?

190
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:32,374
I'll deal with these girls.

191
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:35,141
Let's go, Geronimo.
You know the drill.

192
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:36,940
Let's go, you clowns.

193
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,141
It's bedtime for bozos.

194
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:41,842
You two ladies, too.
Let's go.

195
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,007
Secretary of Energy
Pillerton, however...

196
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:47,308
Thank you.

197
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,940
...fully refutes
these speculations,

198
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:51,109
insisting...

199
00:14:54,376 --> 00:14:56,308
See you, Bobby.

200
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,241
- Excellent.
- You got it? Need a bag?

201
00:14:58,243 --> 00:14:59,474
- No, thanks.
- All right.

202
00:14:59,476 --> 00:15:01,308
- Bye, Bobby.
- See you guys.

203
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,274
Wow, it's still so light out.

204
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:05,274
Okay. So...

205
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:24,207
- Bilbo Baggins.
- Hey, Dean.

206
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:26,474
- What's up, buddy?
- How's things?

207
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:28,408
After-hours delivery, WU-PS.

208
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,441
Check this out.

209
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:33,408
Got some
<i>Weird News of the World.</i>

210
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,940
The Earth off its axis.

211
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:39,809
That's bad news.

212
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:46,942
This is for you right here,
for your collection.

213
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:50,274
Oh, man. <i>Starlog.</i>

214
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:52,107
<i>Eerie.</i>

215
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:55,174
<i>Creepy,</i> number 61.

216
00:15:55,176 --> 00:15:58,308
April 1974.

217
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,441
That motherfucker's rare,
before you was born and shit.

218
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:04,174
Oh, man. Here, let me
give you some money.

219
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:06,007
No, that's on me.

220
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:08,341
- Add it to your collection.
- Thanks, man.

221
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,940
Just give me
your Herbie Hancock right here,

222
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:13,907
and I'll be on my way.

223
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:15,474
They need to fix the AC.

224
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:18,207
You know, it's kind of hot
in this motherfucker, huh?

225
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:20,074
All right.

226
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:21,474
Okay-dokay.

227
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:24,176
All right,
see you next week, Frodo.

228
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,107
Hey, Dean.

229
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:33,041
I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind just, uh,

230
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:35,410
dropping a little wisdom
until the next delivery.

231
00:16:38,443 --> 00:16:40,809
The world is perfect.

232
00:16:43,343 --> 00:16:46,276
Appreciate the details.

233
00:16:55,076 --> 00:16:57,241
"The world is perfect.

234
00:16:57,243 --> 00:17:00,143
Appreciate the details."

235
00:17:05,876 --> 00:17:07,874
You guys shouldn't be here.

236
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:14,243
Strange.

237
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:29,043
Tasty porcinis.

238
00:17:31,043 --> 00:17:33,043
Okay.

239
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,107
Mmm.

240
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:52,274
Kitty!

241
00:17:52,276 --> 00:17:53,474
Good evening.

242
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:55,007
This is Posie Juarez.

243
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,241
We interrupt this program

244
00:17:56,243 --> 00:18:00,341
for a Centerville 7 News
Special Report.

245
00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:03,241
People are saying their pets
have either just disappeared

246
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:06,940
or are acting unusually
skittish and aggressive.

247
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:08,940
Here's a report
from Harrisville.

248
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:11,874
Look at this.

249
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:16,874
I mean, I just couldn't find
my cat, Rainbow.

250
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:18,874
And when I finally did
find her,

251
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:20,940
she was under the house.

252
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:23,007
She's never done that before.

253
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:25,007
She's not usually like that.

254
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:27,174
She's very gentle and...

255
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:30,207
That's so strange.
Where are you guys?

256
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:34,274
...too, and she had
this wild look in her eye,

257
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:37,241
and when I finally tried
to pull her out,

258
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:41,374
she scratched me all to shreds,
like a wild animal.

259
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:44,274
That's so creepy.
I knew...

260
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:46,207
We're back?

261
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,074
Hello.

262
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:51,940
Wow, that is strange, and it
seems to be happening all over.

263
00:18:51,942 --> 00:18:54,308
We'll have more reports
at 11:00.

264
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,207
But for now,
this is Posie Juarez

265
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:57,641
for Centerville 7 News.

266
00:18:57,643 --> 00:18:59,107
Stay safe...

267
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:01,041
and keep your eyes open.

268
00:19:01,043 --> 00:19:03,043
Rumsfeld.

269
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:08,074
Rumsfeld. Here, boy.

270
00:19:08,076 --> 00:19:10,076
Where the hell are you?

271
00:19:15,143 --> 00:19:17,308
Goddamn dog.

272
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:22,276
Rumsfeld? You out here?

273
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:25,940
Rumsfeld,
what you doing over there?

274
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:27,174
Get your ass inside.

275
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:33,241
Come on, stupid.

276
00:19:33,243 --> 00:19:35,209
Hey.

277
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,441
What are you doing?

278
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:43,976
Goddamn it.

279
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,974
Holy shit.

280
00:19:48,976 --> 00:19:51,310
Who stole my fucking cows?

281
00:19:56,176 --> 00:19:58,809
Where the hell are my chickens?

282
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,940
Frank's cows.

283
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:10,809
Into the woods, ladies.

284
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:14,076
Welcome to my world.

285
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:24,341
Damn it, Mallory.

286
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:28,343
Even dead,
you reek of chardonnay.

287
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:33,907
Cheap chardonnay.

288
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:38,341
How's she looking?

289
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:41,343
Well, she's not getting
any older.

290
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:46,074
Wow.
The diner sure makes

291
00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:48,408
the world's best coffee,
doesn't it?

292
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,041
Yeah, but how can you
drink it so late?

293
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:54,074
- Won't it keep you up?
- No, I sleep like a baby.

294
00:20:54,076 --> 00:20:55,907
Except maybe when I know
there's a corpse

295
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:57,107
waiting for me at work.

296
00:20:57,109 --> 00:20:59,007
Oh, y-yeah.

297
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,074
Cliff, is the coroner
from Latrobe

298
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:02,441
gonna pick her up tomorrow?

299
00:21:02,443 --> 00:21:04,907
It's getting a little creepy
being here alone

300
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:07,241
with Mallory decomposing
in there.

301
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:10,107
Yeah, they're supposed to come
pick her up tomorrow morning.

302
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:12,074
Thank God.

303
00:21:12,076 --> 00:21:14,474
I don't know why she can't be
over at the funeral home.

304
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:19,107
'Cause she's going
to Potter's Field in Latrobe.

305
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:22,074
And 'cause our new
unusual undertaker,

306
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:25,341
Ms. Winston,
has got those two golfers

307
00:21:25,343 --> 00:21:27,974
that were struck by lightning...
the Logans.

308
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,441
Thanks, Ronnie.

309
00:21:39,443 --> 00:21:41,207
It's not really necessary,
but...

310
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:43,308
Can I, uh,
drive you home, Mindy?

311
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,874
Also not necessary, Ronnie.
You know I have my car here.

312
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:48,207
Oh, yeah.

313
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:51,074
- How is the Prius running?
- Fine.

314
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,874
Can you even fit two people in
that little Smart car of yours?

315
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:57,174
Well, yeah.
Holds two nicely.

316
00:21:57,176 --> 00:22:00,374
This daylight thing
is bothering me.

317
00:22:00,376 --> 00:22:02,474
It's strange.

318
00:22:02,476 --> 00:22:04,241
Well, what can I say?

319
00:22:04,243 --> 00:22:06,141
The world is
kind of strange lately.

320
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:08,341
Yeah, it sure is.

321
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:11,176
If you ask me, this whole thing
is gonna end badly.

322
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:17,007
So, what exactly do you mean,
Ronnie?

323
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:19,308
Oh, uh, don't know.

324
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,274
Just a feeling, I guess.

325
00:22:21,276 --> 00:22:22,974
Strong feeling.

326
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,041
Oh, boy.

327
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,974
You okay doing the whole
night shift alone, Cliff?

328
00:22:27,976 --> 00:22:29,907
Yeah, I can take a nap.

329
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:32,341
I mean, I can just lie down
in that other cell

330
00:22:32,343 --> 00:22:35,007
next to old Mallory.

331
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:36,341
Oh, God.

332
00:22:36,343 --> 00:22:39,243
Next to her... her dead body?

333
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:44,176
Might bring back
some old memories.

334
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:48,374
See you guys tomorrow.

335
00:22:48,376 --> 00:22:51,043
- See you, Cliff.
- Yeah, see you tomorrow, Chief.

336
00:22:57,076 --> 00:23:00,374
"This is all gonna end badly."

337
00:23:00,376 --> 00:23:03,076
What does that mean?

338
00:23:05,143 --> 00:23:08,341
I knew Mallory O'Brien
since I was a kid.

339
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:10,641
And believe it or not,

340
00:23:10,643 --> 00:23:12,974
sh-she was
a pretty young thing, too.

341
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:16,074
Please.

342
00:23:16,076 --> 00:23:19,474
Sorry, but good riddance
to that drunken old goat.

343
00:23:19,476 --> 00:23:22,074
Well, I-I-I don't know, Fern.

344
00:23:22,076 --> 00:23:25,074
Geez, I got to get up
out of here.

345
00:23:25,076 --> 00:23:27,641
I-I got to, uh, get
to the hardware store

346
00:23:27,643 --> 00:23:30,308
early tomorrow morning.

347
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,041
I'm looking forward
to seeing you ladies tomorrow.

348
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:34,374
- Mm.
- Take care, Hank.

349
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:36,374
Good night, Hank. Sweet dreams.

350
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:39,207
Hank is such a gentleman.

351
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,374
Sure is.

352
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:45,974
Well, I better
get started cleaning here.

353
00:23:45,976 --> 00:23:47,874
Listen, Lily.

354
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:50,107
I've been dying to ask you
about that new foreign woman

355
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:51,940
that took over
the funeral home.

356
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:53,274
What's her name?

357
00:23:53,276 --> 00:23:55,074
Her name is Zelda Winston.

358
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:57,074
And she's strange, for sure.

359
00:23:57,076 --> 00:23:59,207
And she's got these, like,
really weird eyes,

360
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:01,940
like she's, like,
looking right through you.

361
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,374
She pays me really well,
though.

362
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:06,141
Zelda. What-what kind
of name is that?

363
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:07,874
I don't know.

364
00:24:07,876 --> 00:24:10,107
She's probably, like, Irish
or Scottish or whatever.

365
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:11,874
And she talks
really funny, though,

366
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:13,274
so I don't always get it right.

367
00:24:13,276 --> 00:24:15,408
But I like the name Zelda.

368
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:19,209
It reminds me of, um,
Zelda Fitzgerald.

369
00:24:20,243 --> 00:24:21,940
Who's that?

370
00:24:21,942 --> 00:24:24,907
That's Great Gatsby's wife.

371
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:27,308
And who's that?

372
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,074
That's the really rich guy
from the 1920s.

373
00:24:30,076 --> 00:24:31,842
The Robert Redford guy.

374
00:24:33,209 --> 00:24:35,308
Well, anyway,
so what's it like over there

375
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,940
in those secret rooms
since she took over?

376
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:41,907
Well, there's these, like,
really creepy back rooms,

377
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:44,141
you know, where they, like,
keep all the stiffs.

378
00:24:44,143 --> 00:24:48,174
And then next to that,
there's this big golden Buddha.

379
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:49,374
A what, now?

380
00:24:49,376 --> 00:24:51,341
There's a big, shiny,
golden Buddha.

381
00:24:51,343 --> 00:24:53,074
And then there's these, like,

382
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:56,174
old-looking samurai swords
on a rack.

383
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:59,441
Really?

384
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:43,842
<i>Amituofo.</i>

385
00:26:54,876 --> 00:26:56,976
That's peculiar.

386
00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:11,809
Now, stay put, will you?

387
00:27:58,942 --> 00:28:02,174
What is it, Liv?

388
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,308
You okay?

389
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,007
Yeah.

390
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:08,341
I guess so.

391
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:11,907
I just got this creepy feeling.

392
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:15,074
You were probably just
having a bad dream.

393
00:28:15,076 --> 00:28:17,341
Yeah, guess so.

394
00:28:17,343 --> 00:28:20,107
A bad dream.

395
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:23,009
It's okay.
Just go back to sleep.

396
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:26,942
Thanks, Stell.

397
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:52,940
Hmm.

398
00:28:52,942 --> 00:28:56,074
Toxic lunar vibrations.

399
00:29:59,143 --> 00:30:02,074
All right, honey, I'm done.

400
00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:04,176
I'm leaving your money here.

401
00:30:06,343 --> 00:30:08,141
I'm out of here, Lil.

402
00:30:08,143 --> 00:30:09,474
Okay, Fern.
See you tomorrow.

403
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,940
Not if I see you first.

404
00:30:11,942 --> 00:30:13,074
Very funny.

405
00:30:13,076 --> 00:30:15,074
Excuse me, we're closed.

406
00:30:15,076 --> 00:30:17,074
What... what happened to you?

407
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:19,341
Aah! Lily!

408
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:27,474
Oh, get the fuck away from me,

409
00:30:27,476 --> 00:30:29,940
you little motherfucker!
Oh, I'll fucking kill you!

410
00:30:29,942 --> 00:30:31,141
I'll shove this mop up
your fucking ass, motherfucker!

411
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:35,074
Get the fuck away from me!

412
00:31:06,876 --> 00:31:08,243
Coffee.

413
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,410
Coffee.

414
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:25,974
Coffee.

415
00:32:38,376 --> 00:32:40,374
Centerville Police Department.

416
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:43,308
This is Chief Robertson.

417
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:46,107
Hi, Hank. What's up?

418
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:48,243
Is it really 6:30?

419
00:32:53,209 --> 00:32:54,942
What?

420
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:58,942
At the diner?

421
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:21,074
Uh, like I said
on the phone, Cliff,

422
00:33:21,076 --> 00:33:25,174
often, Fern gets here early,
and so I thought I might

423
00:33:25,176 --> 00:33:28,341
get some coffee to go,
and-and then this.

424
00:33:28,343 --> 00:33:30,441
Oh, my God.

425
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:32,874
I-I saw them.

426
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:34,876
Fern and Lily.

427
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:44,209
Oh, man.

428
00:34:11,243 --> 00:34:13,441
Uh, wh-what the hell was it?

429
00:34:13,443 --> 00:34:17,074
A wild animal?
Uh, several wild animals?

430
00:34:17,076 --> 00:34:19,874
I don't know.

431
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:24,041
But whatever it was,
it even smashed the coffeepots.

432
00:34:57,976 --> 00:34:59,909
Oh, yuck.

433
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:15,410
Jesus Christ, Cliff.

434
00:35:17,942 --> 00:35:21,074
What the heck was it,
a wild animal?

435
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:23,074
Several wild animals?

436
00:35:23,076 --> 00:35:25,107
That's exactly what I said.

437
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:46,241
Hey, guys.

438
00:35:46,243 --> 00:35:50,141
Wow. Fern's really done wonders
with these flower beds.

439
00:35:50,143 --> 00:35:52,343
Really perks up the place, huh?

440
00:35:56,076 --> 00:35:58,141
What?

441
00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:00,874
- What happened?
- God, Mindy.

442
00:36:00,876 --> 00:36:03,209
I don't think
you want to see this.

443
00:36:28,209 --> 00:36:31,310
Uh, no, no, I didn't need
to see that.

444
00:36:34,143 --> 00:36:36,041
Was it a wild animal?

445
00:36:36,043 --> 00:36:39,043
Or several wild animals?

446
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:44,207
Cliff, is that really
Fern and Lily in there?

447
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:46,207
Uh, no.

448
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:50,942
That was Fern and Lily,
but now...

449
00:36:57,976 --> 00:37:00,174
Do you need me here?

450
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,976
Maybe you could help out
with crowd control.

451
00:37:05,243 --> 00:37:08,241
Okay, folks, can you move it
along now, please?

452
00:37:08,243 --> 00:37:10,207
Thank you.

453
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:12,341
I can't believe it.

454
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,940
God, Ronnie.
This is really awful.

455
00:37:27,942 --> 00:37:30,341
Maybe the worst thing
I've ever seen.

456
00:37:30,343 --> 00:37:33,940
Yeah. Sure is.

457
00:37:33,942 --> 00:37:37,141
I...

458
00:37:37,143 --> 00:37:39,274
I-I got to go.

459
00:37:57,176 --> 00:37:58,974
So, what are you thinking?

460
00:38:01,876 --> 00:38:05,107
You... you really want to know?

461
00:38:07,143 --> 00:38:09,141
I'm thinking zombies.

462
00:38:09,143 --> 00:38:11,041
What?

463
00:38:11,043 --> 00:38:12,974
You know, zombies.

464
00:38:12,976 --> 00:38:16,076
Ghouls. The undead.

465
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:20,974
Are you...

466
00:38:20,976 --> 00:38:22,976
you're trying to tell me...

467
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:27,176
...you're thinking
zombies did this?

468
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:32,074
Yup.

469
00:38:53,143 --> 00:38:55,141
Hey, Jack,
will you check your phone

470
00:38:55,143 --> 00:38:58,109
- and see where we are exactly?
- Yeah.

471
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,341
Oh, man.

472
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,976
I'm not getting
any reception out here.

473
00:39:09,976 --> 00:39:12,107
Geez, I don't even know
if my phone's working,

474
00:39:12,109 --> 00:39:13,909
- for some reason.
- Hmm.

475
00:39:15,643 --> 00:39:18,241
Let me try the radio.

476
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:24,141
Oh, wow,
it's working again, so...

477
00:39:24,143 --> 00:39:26,074
I mean,
they're absolutely wrong.

478
00:39:26,076 --> 00:39:27,874
We know very well
that polar fracking

479
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:29,207
has been great
for this country.

480
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:31,207
In my opinion, these naysayers

481
00:39:31,209 --> 00:39:32,907
should just move
to somewhere else

482
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:35,074
- where they don't have to...

Hey, kids, how's it going?

Eat me.

Whoa, this place is a trip.

512
00:41:31,876 --> 00:41:33,343
Sure is.

513
00:41:34,143 --> 00:41:36,308
Oh. Hi.

514
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,641
Hi.

515
00:41:37,643 --> 00:41:39,474
Nice shirt.

516
00:41:39,476 --> 00:41:42,174
- <i>Nosferatu.</i>
- Yeah.

517
00:41:42,176 --> 00:41:45,074
It's really cool.

518
00:41:45,076 --> 00:41:47,907
Thanks. I make 'em.

519
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:50,374
How about that?
Earth off its axis.

520
00:41:50,376 --> 00:41:53,243
- End of the world.
- Mm.

521
00:41:55,276 --> 00:41:57,107
Flesh-eating zombies.

522
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:59,274
You get a lot of zombies
around here?

523
00:41:59,276 --> 00:42:02,076
That depends, I guess.

524
00:42:03,343 --> 00:42:06,308
Uh, so... so, about the gas.

525
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:09,940
You want to pay cash or credit?

526
00:42:09,942 --> 00:42:12,341
Here you go, Frodo.

527
00:42:12,343 --> 00:42:15,874
Cool. Thanks.

528
00:42:15,876 --> 00:42:20,207
Uh, did you, uh...

529
00:42:20,209 --> 00:42:22,341
Did you just call me Frodo?

530
00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:23,641
Did I?

531
00:42:23,643 --> 00:42:25,940
Hey, is there a motel in town?

532
00:42:25,942 --> 00:42:27,207
Yeah, there is one

533
00:42:27,209 --> 00:42:28,907
- just down the...
- Ooh.

534
00:42:28,909 --> 00:42:30,374
Oh, that's a really good CD.

535
00:42:30,376 --> 00:42:33,107
Sturgill Simpson,
"The Dead Don't Die."

536
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:35,074
Yeah, I know.
I love this song.

537
00:42:35,076 --> 00:42:37,174
Is it nice?

538
00:42:37,176 --> 00:42:39,308
- What?
- The motel.

539
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,907
Oh, yeah.
It's, uh... it's kind of cool.

540
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:43,341
It's one of those
old-school ones.

541
00:42:43,343 --> 00:42:45,341
Like in old-school
horror movies,

542
00:42:45,343 --> 00:42:49,907
with, like... like in <i>Psycho</i>
with the separated bungalows?

543
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:52,107
Uh, the Bates Motel in <i>Psycho</i>

544
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:55,343
was not separated into
"little bungalows."

545
00:42:57,109 --> 00:43:00,074
- Ooh.
- All right.

546
00:43:00,076 --> 00:43:04,441
That's 12 for the CD
and two dollars for the soda.

547
00:43:04,443 --> 00:43:06,641
- Here you go. You can just keep the change.
- Thanks.

548
00:43:06,643 --> 00:43:08,374
Oh, cool.

549
00:43:08,376 --> 00:43:11,009
Whoa.

550
00:43:16,209 --> 00:43:19,341
That's a super cool ride,
by the way.

551
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:21,974
Very, uh, George Romero.

552
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:23,341
Yeah, it's a classic.

553
00:43:23,343 --> 00:43:26,207
Your film knowledge
is impressive.

554
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:27,974
What's your name?

555
00:43:27,976 --> 00:43:29,341
Bobby.

556
00:43:29,343 --> 00:43:31,241
Bobby Wiggins.

557
00:43:31,243 --> 00:43:34,041
What's that?
Bobby Baggins?

558
00:43:34,043 --> 00:43:36,441
No, Wiggins.

559
00:43:36,443 --> 00:43:38,341
I'm Zoe.

560
00:43:38,343 --> 00:43:39,940
Thanks, Bobby.

561
00:44:32,942 --> 00:44:34,474
Will the Feds be
brought in on this?

562
00:44:34,476 --> 00:44:37,343
It's... it's really weird.

563
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:42,274
I see.

564
00:44:42,276 --> 00:44:44,308
But Miss O'Brien...

565
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,976
so she has to stay with us
another night?

566
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,907
Oh, God.

567
00:44:51,909 --> 00:44:54,343
Okay. Thank you.

568
00:44:56,909 --> 00:44:58,174
Hello, Ms. Winston.

569
00:44:58,176 --> 00:45:00,308
Hello,
Officer Minerva Morrison.

570
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:02,207
Do call me Zelda.

571
00:45:02,209 --> 00:45:04,907
Yeah, okay, sure.

572
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:06,907
You've been informed
of the tragedy?

573
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:08,074
I have.

574
00:45:08,076 --> 00:45:09,940
Am I to understand
that the remains

575
00:45:09,942 --> 00:45:12,107
will be brought to
The Ever After Funeral Home

576
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:13,374
for my preparations?

577
00:45:13,376 --> 00:45:15,074
Uh, no,
that won't be necessary.

578
00:45:15,076 --> 00:45:17,141
The Feds have already
collected the remains.

579
00:45:17,143 --> 00:45:19,041
They've brought them
out of the county.

580
00:45:19,043 --> 00:45:21,043
I see.

581
00:45:29,276 --> 00:45:31,274
Is there anything else
I can do?

582
00:45:31,276 --> 00:45:32,940
Yes.

583
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:34,474
I do have
an unrelated question.

584
00:45:34,476 --> 00:45:37,341
- Shoot.
- "Shoot"?

585
00:45:37,343 --> 00:45:39,241
I mean ask me.

586
00:45:39,243 --> 00:45:41,074
Oh, yes.

587
00:45:41,076 --> 00:45:43,341
Are you, by any chance,
a couple?

588
00:45:43,343 --> 00:45:45,341
You and the physically
attractive one?

589
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:48,374
Um, you mean the younger one?

590
00:45:48,376 --> 00:45:50,074
Officer Peterson?

591
00:45:50,076 --> 00:45:53,209
That's the one I mean...
Officer Ronald Peterson.

592
00:45:55,209 --> 00:45:58,241
Well, actually, no.

593
00:45:58,243 --> 00:46:00,974
Why do you ask, Zelda?

594
00:46:00,976 --> 00:46:04,074
Just accumulating
local information.

595
00:46:04,076 --> 00:46:06,074
Oh.

596
00:46:06,076 --> 00:46:08,043
Okay.

597
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:18,207
Dear Jesus.

598
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:20,241
I mean, that's
absolutely horrible.

599
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:22,241
I mean, who or what is-is-is

600
00:46:22,243 --> 00:46:24,907
per-perpetrating
these... these...

601
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:26,141
Hey.

602
00:46:26,143 --> 00:46:29,074
- What's going on?
- Hey.

603
00:46:29,076 --> 00:46:31,074
Nice car.

604
00:46:31,076 --> 00:46:33,107
'68 Pontiac LeMans.

605
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:35,041
Yeah. It's a beauty, huh?

606
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:37,174
It's our friend's
totally rad ride.

607
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:40,141
It's a classic.

608
00:46:40,143 --> 00:46:42,041
Have a good one.

609
00:46:42,043 --> 00:46:43,207
Later.

610
00:46:43,209 --> 00:46:44,641
Guys, I'm so hungry.

611
00:46:44,643 --> 00:46:46,374
Same. Let's eat.

612
00:46:46,376 --> 00:46:48,376
I'll ask. H-Hey.

613
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:52,074
- Nice car.
- Thank you.

614
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:54,441
Uh, do you guys know if there's
a diner or restaurant nearby?

615
00:46:54,443 --> 00:46:55,441
Sorry.

616
00:46:55,443 --> 00:47:00,074
The only diner in town
is closed, indefinitely.

617
00:47:00,076 --> 00:47:01,341
Well, that's unfortunate.

618
00:47:01,343 --> 00:47:04,341
Uh, but we, uh, have
several vending machines

619
00:47:04,343 --> 00:47:07,341
containing snacks, uh,
right over by the office.

620
00:47:07,343 --> 00:47:08,907
Okay. Thanks.

621
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,074
Do you have change
for three dollars?

622
00:47:10,076 --> 00:47:12,076
Yeah, I do.

623
00:47:22,076 --> 00:47:24,374
I like your badge.

624
00:47:24,376 --> 00:47:28,207
Oh, th... thank you.

625
00:47:28,209 --> 00:47:30,308
That's, uh...

626
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,441
- That-that should be good.
- Oh, okay.

627
00:47:35,443 --> 00:47:36,974
- Thanks.
- Oh, no, no.

628
00:47:36,976 --> 00:47:38,341
- You can, you can have it.
- Yeah?

629
00:47:38,343 --> 00:47:40,942
Okay. Thanks.

630
00:47:42,009 --> 00:47:44,207
They just checked in.

631
00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:47,041
Hipsters from the big city.

632
00:47:47,043 --> 00:47:49,341
- Yeah?
- Yep.

633
00:47:49,343 --> 00:47:52,107
My educated guess
would be Pittsburgh.

634
00:47:52,109 --> 00:47:54,408
They got that urban style,
you know.

635
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,974
Oh, well, those plates
are from Ohio,

636
00:47:56,976 --> 00:47:59,641
so my educated guess
would be Cleveland.

637
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:03,343
Oh. Cleveland. Hmm.

638
00:48:05,209 --> 00:48:08,174
Yeah, Cleveland.

639
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,408
Thanks.

640
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:11,109
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

641
00:48:13,909 --> 00:48:15,274
That girl's part Mexican.

642
00:48:15,276 --> 00:48:17,041
- Hmm?
- Really?

643
00:48:17,043 --> 00:48:18,441
How can you tell?

644
00:48:18,443 --> 00:48:20,274
I have an affinity
for Mexicans.

645
00:48:20,276 --> 00:48:22,141
They're, like,
my favorite people.

646
00:48:22,143 --> 00:48:26,007
I love Mexico.
I've been down there twice.

647
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:27,274
Okay, Ronnie,

648
00:48:27,276 --> 00:48:29,408
then you should be the one
to inform them

649
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,241
that if they're gonna spend
the night in Centerville,

650
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:36,207
to not go out and to keep
their hotel room door locked.

651
00:48:36,209 --> 00:48:37,942
Okay?

652
00:48:44,143 --> 00:48:48,308
Uh, you know, Cliff, uh...

653
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:51,308
I know this isn't important
comparatively, uh,

654
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:54,041
but, uh, all of my cats are gone.

655
00:48:54,043 --> 00:48:57,107
And-and, normally, they-they,
uh, just stay inside.

656
00:48:59,343 --> 00:49:01,107
Well, I'm sorry
about that, Danny.

657
00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:02,874
They could be hiding.

658
00:49:04,476 --> 00:49:07,408
Nothing is happening normally
right now.

659
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:10,141
- Yeah.
- How did they react?

660
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:13,341
They said, "I heard you had
a lot of zombies around here,"

661
00:49:13,343 --> 00:49:16,107
and then they laughed.

662
00:49:16,109 --> 00:49:20,940
Infernal hipsters
with their irony.

663
00:49:59,343 --> 00:50:01,343
Melville.

664
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:07,365
"Nameless miseries
of the numberless mortals."

665
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:21,399
Well, everything
looks normal out there.

666
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:22,899
Yeah.

667
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:26,332
But what happened
sounds like the start of

668
00:50:26,334 --> 00:50:28,699
- a gruesome horror film.
- Sure does.

669
00:50:28,701 --> 00:50:31,499
Boo!

670
00:50:31,501 --> 00:50:34,532
Really, really not funny,
Geronimo.

671
00:50:34,534 --> 00:50:37,632
You guys hear about those
grisly murders at the diner?

672
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:40,399
Yeah.
Just talking about them.

673
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:42,365
Creepy.

674
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:43,799
I've been listening
to the radio,

675
00:50:43,801 --> 00:50:46,332
and I'm sure
it's the undead, yo.

676
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,766
Reanimated by the Earth
being thrown off its axis

677
00:50:48,768 --> 00:50:50,699
from the polar fracking.

678
00:50:50,701 --> 00:50:52,532
What are you saying?

679
00:50:52,534 --> 00:50:54,532
I'm saying...

680
00:50:54,534 --> 00:50:57,766
full-on
zombie apocalypse, baby.

681
00:50:57,768 --> 00:50:59,766
Soon, there'll be
hordes of them.

682
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:02,365
- Geronimo.
- Shit.

683
00:51:02,367 --> 00:51:04,066
Do you want to lose
your privileges again?

684
00:51:04,068 --> 00:51:05,833
No, sir.

685
00:51:05,835 --> 00:51:07,768
Then let's go.

686
00:51:09,768 --> 00:51:11,768
Unbelievable.

687
00:51:35,835 --> 00:51:38,499
Cliff,
why'd they used to separate

688
00:51:38,501 --> 00:51:40,499
the children's graves
from the adults'?

689
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:41,733
Don't know.

690
00:51:41,735 --> 00:51:44,332
Some kind of
a 19th-century thing.

691
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:46,365
Huh.

692
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:49,432
Seems like a bad idea somehow.

693
00:51:49,434 --> 00:51:52,566
Yeah. So, what exactly are we
looking for here? Zombies?

694
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:09,332
Hey, look over here.

695
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:11,334
Here's another one.

696
00:52:15,634 --> 00:52:18,701
Oh, man.
This isn't gonna end well.

697
00:52:49,601 --> 00:52:51,733
Goddamn it.

698
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,735
Ghouls.

699
00:52:56,634 --> 00:52:59,532
This is undead, reanimated,

700
00:52:59,534 --> 00:53:02,632
full-on,
flesh-eating zombie shit.

701
00:53:02,634 --> 00:53:04,634
No question.

702
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:26,634
I was supposed to retire.

703
00:53:28,768 --> 00:53:31,334
- Two years ago.
- I know.

704
00:53:32,768 --> 00:53:35,499
- Why didn't you?
- What?

705
00:53:35,501 --> 00:53:37,766
Retire two years ago.

706
00:53:37,768 --> 00:53:40,833
Are we improvising here?

707
00:53:40,835 --> 00:53:43,566
No, I was just asking.

708
00:53:43,568 --> 00:53:45,566
But I probably know
the answer anyway.

709
00:53:45,568 --> 00:53:48,434
Probably. Yeah.

710
00:53:52,367 --> 00:53:54,833
So, is our plan
to continue to inform people

711
00:53:54,835 --> 00:53:57,566
about the zombie danger
before it gets dark?

712
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,833
Oh, God, Ronnie.

713
00:53:59,835 --> 00:54:02,632
Uh... I guess so.

714
00:54:02,634 --> 00:54:04,466
Because we passed
Farmer Miller's place

715
00:54:04,468 --> 00:54:06,766
a little while ago.
Do we need to inform him?

716
00:54:06,768 --> 00:54:09,566
Fuck Farmer Miller.

717
00:54:09,568 --> 00:54:11,566
Really?

718
00:54:11,568 --> 00:54:14,367
He is a citizen of Centerville.

719
00:54:15,768 --> 00:54:17,835
You're right. Uh...

720
00:54:19,835 --> 00:54:21,833
We'll have Mindy call him.

721
00:54:21,835 --> 00:54:23,835
Oh, okay.

722
00:54:32,735 --> 00:54:35,899
So, Ronnie, how the fuck
do you kill a zombie?

723
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:38,301
Well, you got to kill the head.

724
00:54:39,634 --> 00:54:41,833
- "Kill the head."
- Yeah.

725
00:54:41,835 --> 00:54:46,499
By any means necessary,
kill the head.

726
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:48,601
Decapitate.
It's the only way to kill them.

727
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:53,766
Jesus.

728
00:54:53,768 --> 00:54:59,632
And that's really the only way
to stop zombies,

729
00:54:59,634 --> 00:55:02,466
is to kill the head, Hank.

730
00:55:02,468 --> 00:55:07,899
I know it's gruesome,
but complete decapitation.

731
00:55:07,901 --> 00:55:12,599
Doesn't matter if you use
a-a machete, steel wire,

732
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,733
hedge clippers, whatever.

733
00:55:14,735 --> 00:55:18,532
Just as long as the spinal cord
is severed, right?

734
00:55:18,534 --> 00:55:21,768
And the head... is cut off.

735
00:55:23,768 --> 00:55:26,833
And that's it.
De-animated.

736
00:55:26,835 --> 00:55:30,499
Only way to kill the dead:

737
00:55:30,501 --> 00:55:32,066
kill the head.

738
00:55:32,068 --> 00:55:33,766
Uh, wait, Bobby.

739
00:55:33,768 --> 00:55:37,468
I-I'm not so sure
it was zombies.

740
00:55:41,701 --> 00:55:45,799
You said they ate
Lily and Fern's flesh.

741
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:48,699
Usually, they go for
the brains.

742
00:55:48,701 --> 00:55:51,599
It's unusual, but...

743
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:54,365
it's still cannibals, man.

744
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,799
Mm.

745
00:55:55,801 --> 00:55:58,432
Definitely zombies.

746
00:55:58,434 --> 00:55:59,833
Okay?

747
00:55:59,835 --> 00:56:02,499
Hank, you can trust me.

748
00:56:02,501 --> 00:56:05,833
I've seen almost every
zombie film ever made.

749
00:56:05,835 --> 00:56:07,666
Mm.

750
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:10,766
This is zombie shit going down,
and we got to get prepared.

751
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:12,666
I don't know
what to think anymore.

752
00:56:14,568 --> 00:56:16,666
Hank, the shells.

753
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:18,668
Oh, yeah.

754
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:25,733
Better safe than sorry.

755
00:56:25,735 --> 00:56:28,733
Yeah, you're right.

756
00:56:28,735 --> 00:56:31,434
Safe than sorry.

757
00:56:32,735 --> 00:56:35,799
Just kill the head.

758
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:37,432
Several other shocking

759
00:56:37,434 --> 00:56:38,699
and brutal attacks

760
00:56:38,701 --> 00:56:40,699
occurred in this
residential neighborhood

761
00:56:40,701 --> 00:56:42,399
just outside East Brady.

762
00:56:42,401 --> 00:56:43,766
The images are just
too gruesome

763
00:56:43,768 --> 00:56:45,599
to broadcast at this time,

764
00:56:45,601 --> 00:56:48,432
and police are saying
that it almost looked like

765
00:56:48,434 --> 00:56:51,332
the victims were attacked
by a wild animal

766
00:56:51,334 --> 00:56:53,466
or perhaps
several wild animals.

767
00:56:56,835 --> 00:56:58,599
Police did provide this map

768
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:00,499
showing where these...

769
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:02,532
Goddamn it,
my watch doesn't fucking work.

770
00:57:02,534 --> 00:57:04,766
I just got it.
It's mad expensive.

771
00:57:04,768 --> 00:57:07,365
Holy shit, dude,
this is insane.

772
00:57:07,367 --> 00:57:08,733
Wow.

773
00:57:08,735 --> 00:57:11,432
Maybe that Harry Potter guy
at the gas station

774
00:57:11,434 --> 00:57:12,699
wasn't kidding, man.

775
00:57:12,701 --> 00:57:14,499
What, about-about what?

776
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:15,833
About there being zombies
around here.

777
00:57:15,835 --> 00:57:17,566
That's not even funny.

778
00:57:17,568 --> 00:57:19,566
Don't joke.
It's really, really creepy.

779
00:57:19,568 --> 00:57:21,566
Authorities are
warning all citizens

780
00:57:21,568 --> 00:57:23,733
to stay inside
and keep all doors

781
00:57:23,735 --> 00:57:25,666
and windows locked and secured.

782
00:57:25,668 --> 00:57:27,299
Zack, lock the door, will you?

783
00:57:27,301 --> 00:57:28,632
- Got you.
- But for now,

784
00:57:28,634 --> 00:57:30,833
this is Posie Juarez
for Centerville 7 News.

785
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:35,301
Stay safe
and keep your eyes open.

786
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:37,567
Kitties!

787
00:58:39,901 --> 00:58:41,968
Where are you guys?

788
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,734
Kitties!

789
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:55,834
Kitties!

790
00:59:00,968 --> 00:59:04,565
What in the name of...

791
00:59:04,567 --> 00:59:06,066
Cats are gone.

792
00:59:06,068 --> 00:59:08,966
Haven't seen or heard a bird
in two days.

793
00:59:08,968 --> 00:59:10,866
It's already night out.

794
00:59:10,868 --> 00:59:13,766
It's 5:00.

795
00:59:13,768 --> 00:59:15,832
Dear Lord in Heaven, help us.

796
00:59:15,834 --> 00:59:17,799
Free cable.

797
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:20,732
Oh, it's free ca...

798
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:33,768
Thank God you guys are back.

799
00:59:36,035 --> 00:59:39,534
Jesus, Cliff, do we really need
all this stuff?

800
00:59:41,534 --> 00:59:42,999
What's all this for?

801
00:59:43,001 --> 00:59:45,099
We went by the hardware store.

802
00:59:45,101 --> 00:59:47,832
You know what happens.

803
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,866
Hank and that hobbit kid Bobby
from the gas station

804
00:59:50,868 --> 00:59:52,666
have locked themselves in
over there.

805
00:59:52,668 --> 00:59:55,732
They tried to convince
other citizens to join them,

806
00:59:55,734 --> 00:59:57,532
but with no success.

807
00:59:57,534 --> 00:59:58,866
Why? What's happening?

808
00:59:58,868 --> 01:00:00,768
Is it some sort
of epidemic or what?

809
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:04,601
It's zombies.

810
01:00:06,567 --> 01:00:08,599
- What are you saying?
- Well, it's the undead.

811
01:00:08,601 --> 01:00:10,599
They've been reanimated.

812
01:00:10,601 --> 01:00:13,866
Caused by the Earth having been
pulled off its axis,

813
01:00:13,868 --> 01:00:15,599
caused by the polar fracking.

814
01:00:15,601 --> 01:00:17,033
But the authorities
and energy people

815
01:00:17,035 --> 01:00:19,035
keep saying that's not true.

816
01:00:22,834 --> 01:00:24,801
Really?

817
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:31,866
Oh, my God.

818
01:00:31,868 --> 01:00:33,666
- She's alive?
- No.

819
01:00:33,668 --> 01:00:36,699
She's not.
She's just undead.

820
01:00:36,701 --> 01:00:39,666
Chardonnay.

821
01:00:39,668 --> 01:00:42,999
Holy shit.
Did she just say "chardonnay"?

822
01:00:43,001 --> 01:00:45,799
Yeah, she did.

823
01:00:45,801 --> 01:00:47,732
Look out, kids.

824
01:00:47,734 --> 01:00:49,999
Hey, little Mallory.

825
01:00:54,668 --> 01:00:57,832
Chardonnay.

826
01:00:57,834 --> 01:00:59,766
I got this, Cliff.

827
01:01:20,935 --> 01:01:22,699
Chardonnay.

828
01:01:26,035 --> 01:01:28,565
Those are some
pretty good cuts.

829
01:01:28,567 --> 01:01:30,832
You played some
minor league ball, didn't you?

830
01:01:30,834 --> 01:01:32,933
Well, um, a little Class A.

831
01:01:32,935 --> 01:01:34,935
It-it was a long time ago.

832
01:01:36,935 --> 01:01:40,066
Mindy, just remember
to kill the head.

833
01:01:40,068 --> 01:01:42,099
Okay.

834
01:01:42,101 --> 01:01:44,565
Kill the head. Okay.

835
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,565
Ronnie, take this thing
out of here.

836
01:01:46,567 --> 01:01:48,567
You got it, Chief.

837
01:01:51,001 --> 01:01:53,666
Oh, that's very nice.

838
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,966
Very nice, indeed.

839
01:01:55,968 --> 01:01:59,866
You look gorgeous.

840
01:01:59,868 --> 01:02:02,732
You two could have been
the king and queen

841
01:02:02,734 --> 01:02:04,901
of the golf club, so you could.

842
01:02:08,501 --> 01:02:09,968
Oh, my.

843
01:02:17,068 --> 01:02:19,434
What's this?

844
01:02:27,534 --> 01:02:30,099
Are you in this together?

845
01:02:30,101 --> 01:02:32,699
I mean, this is
really inappropriate.

846
01:02:32,701 --> 01:02:35,001
Oh, good grief.

847
01:02:38,834 --> 01:02:40,832
So, the dead just don't
want to die today.

848
01:02:40,834 --> 01:02:42,768
Is that it?

849
01:02:54,035 --> 01:02:56,499
That's a shame.

850
01:02:56,501 --> 01:02:58,801
I had them looking so bonny.

851
01:03:00,701 --> 01:03:03,534
Oh, what is it now?

852
01:03:07,035 --> 01:03:10,035
Who's there?

853
01:03:20,268 --> 01:03:22,035
Shit.

854
01:03:32,001 --> 01:03:33,699
Who the fuck are you,

855
01:03:33,701 --> 01:03:35,266
and what do you want?

856
01:03:35,268 --> 01:03:36,933
Ow! Hey!

857
01:03:36,935 --> 01:03:38,766
Get the fuck...

858
01:03:50,935 --> 01:03:53,766
Shit.

859
01:03:53,768 --> 01:03:55,532
I killed him.

860
01:03:55,534 --> 01:03:56,966
That was weird.

861
01:03:56,968 --> 01:03:58,768
Candy.

862
01:04:00,101 --> 01:04:02,999
- Candy.
- Snapple.

863
01:04:03,001 --> 01:04:04,999
Snapple.

864
01:04:11,868 --> 01:04:13,868
Snickers.

865
01:04:16,768 --> 01:04:20,532
- Popsicle.
- Snickers.

866
01:04:20,534 --> 01:04:22,567
Popsicle.

867
01:04:23,935 --> 01:04:26,035
Popsicle.

868
01:04:36,035 --> 01:04:38,467
Toys.

869
01:04:40,268 --> 01:04:42,467
Skittles.

870
01:04:43,834 --> 01:04:45,834
Toys.

871
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,266
Wi-Fi.

872
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:01,966
Wi-Fi.

873
01:05:01,968 --> 01:05:03,868
Bluetooth.

874
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:08,434
Bluetooth.

875
01:05:10,668 --> 01:05:12,567
Siri.

876
01:05:13,801 --> 01:05:16,567
- Xanax.
- Oxy.

877
01:05:17,834 --> 01:05:20,565
- Xanax.
- Oxy.

878
01:05:20,567 --> 01:05:21,732
Ambien.

879
01:05:21,734 --> 01:05:22,901
Oxy.

880
01:05:27,501 --> 01:05:29,501
Guitar.

881
01:05:31,634 --> 01:05:33,733
Guitar.

882
01:05:33,735 --> 01:05:37,532
- Tools.
- Drill.

883
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:39,499
Sander.

884
01:05:39,501 --> 01:05:41,365
Tools.

885
01:05:42,835 --> 01:05:44,833
- Hey, no. Come on.
- Hey. Hey.

886
01:05:44,835 --> 01:05:46,766
Okay, okay. Holy shit.

887
01:05:46,768 --> 01:05:48,833
- Hey, we need to mow them down.
- Come on, man.

888
01:05:48,835 --> 01:05:50,401
Bobby. Shit.

889
01:06:00,301 --> 01:06:01,634
I got this one, Hank.

890
01:06:06,768 --> 01:06:09,499
Shit.

891
01:06:14,901 --> 01:06:16,666
Hey, Bobby!

892
01:06:16,668 --> 01:06:18,066
The head, Hank!

893
01:06:24,434 --> 01:06:26,699
I killed the head.

894
01:06:37,501 --> 01:06:39,532
What the fuck?
Is this for real?

895
01:06:39,534 --> 01:06:42,332
- Shh, shh! Shh, shh, shh.
- Quiet!

896
01:06:43,601 --> 01:06:45,432
Get the fuck off me!

897
01:06:48,434 --> 01:06:50,833
- Fuck!
- Holy shit!

898
01:06:50,835 --> 01:06:52,666
Shithead!

899
01:06:54,735 --> 01:06:56,365
Save me!

900
01:06:56,367 --> 01:06:58,766
- What? No!
- What are you doing? Stop!

901
01:06:58,768 --> 01:07:00,733
Get the fuck off me!

902
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,501
Closet.

903
01:07:07,835 --> 01:07:09,833
- Fuck!
- Fucking shithead!

904
01:07:17,468 --> 01:07:18,699
...violent...

905
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,499
Reports of these

906
01:07:20,501 --> 01:07:22,066
bizarre attacks are escalating,

907
01:07:22,068 --> 01:07:24,799
with incidents occurring
sporadically across the country

908
01:07:24,801 --> 01:07:28,632
and, as we're now learning,
uh, across the globe.

909
01:07:28,634 --> 01:07:30,466
You see,
these violent marauders

910
01:07:30,468 --> 01:07:33,733
have apparently first
been gathering in cemeteries,

911
01:07:33,735 --> 01:07:37,432
then dispersing
into towns and suburbs,

912
01:07:37,434 --> 01:07:39,532
while other reports suggest...

913
01:07:44,768 --> 01:07:47,234
Great.

914
01:07:49,092 --> 01:07:51,491
Now even the radio's dead.

915
01:07:51,493 --> 01:07:53,491
Good riddance.

916
01:07:55,593 --> 01:07:58,124
Guys...

917
01:07:58,126 --> 01:08:00,224
shouldn't we be
telling each other

918
01:08:00,226 --> 01:08:03,224
that it's all gonna be okay?

919
01:08:03,226 --> 01:08:06,959
That this will all go away,
like a bad dream?

920
01:08:10,092 --> 01:08:12,224
Ronnie?

921
01:08:12,226 --> 01:08:16,393
Gee, Mindy,
I'm not sure I can say that.

922
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,791
Cliff?

923
01:08:23,793 --> 01:08:26,257
Please?

924
01:08:26,259 --> 01:08:29,791
It's all gonna be okay, Mindy.

925
01:08:29,793 --> 01:08:34,259
Maybe it'll all just go away,
like a bad dream.

926
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:40,159
I doubt it.

927
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:00,124
Seven and eight.

928
01:09:00,126 --> 01:09:02,124
Now do both for eight.

929
01:09:02,126 --> 01:09:05,259
And push. And push. Yeah.

930
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,324
Cleveland.

931
01:09:31,193 --> 01:09:32,493
What the...

932
01:09:37,793 --> 01:09:41,359
Now, that's what I call
a murder of crows.

933
01:10:03,226 --> 01:10:06,224
Darn, she's really good
with that thing, isn't she?

934
01:10:06,226 --> 01:10:08,226
She sure is.

935
01:10:13,493 --> 01:10:15,391
She's strange.

936
01:10:15,393 --> 01:10:18,033
- She's Scottish.
- She's Scottish?

937
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:06,009
Let's unbolt the door
and get her in here.

938
01:11:10,543 --> 01:11:14,107
Thank you very much,
Officer Ronald Peterson.

939
01:11:14,109 --> 01:11:16,974
Chief Clifford Robertson.

940
01:11:16,976 --> 01:11:18,541
Officer Minerva Morrison.

941
01:11:18,543 --> 01:11:21,941
What exactly is
your plan of action,

942
01:11:21,943 --> 01:11:23,241
Chief Clifford Robertson?

943
01:11:23,243 --> 01:11:25,974
Well... well...

944
01:11:25,976 --> 01:11:28,208
uh, it's a little
quieter now.

945
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:32,208
I-I think, I guess we should
just get in the patrol car...

946
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:35,541
some of us, anyway...
and, uh, patrol the community.

947
01:11:35,543 --> 01:11:37,141
After all, that is our job.

948
01:11:37,143 --> 01:11:38,840
I'm not staying here.

949
01:11:38,842 --> 01:11:41,107
I-I think we should all
go together.

950
01:11:41,109 --> 01:11:44,076
Well, I guess you're right.

951
01:11:46,276 --> 01:11:48,241
I could stay here
and monitor things,

952
01:11:48,243 --> 01:11:50,241
if that would help.

953
01:11:50,243 --> 01:11:52,041
I'm quite confident
of my ability

954
01:11:52,043 --> 01:11:54,341
to defend myself
against the undead.

955
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:57,210
Well, I-I can see that.

956
01:11:59,842 --> 01:12:04,210
But, uh, can you operate the
police radio and our computer?

957
01:12:06,809 --> 01:12:08,941
Oh, aye.

958
01:12:08,943 --> 01:12:10,341
No bother.

959
01:12:10,343 --> 01:12:11,907
Certainly.

960
01:12:11,909 --> 01:12:13,274
Yeah, if it still works.

961
01:12:13,276 --> 01:12:15,107
I don't know.

962
01:12:15,109 --> 01:12:19,274
That would be a little unusual,
wouldn't it, Cliff?

963
01:12:19,276 --> 01:12:21,308
Well, this is
a highly unusual situation

964
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:25,107
we're in, is it not,
Chief Clifford Robertson?

965
01:12:25,109 --> 01:12:28,840
Perhaps we could all
meet up again in a wee while

966
01:12:28,842 --> 01:12:31,174
in the cemetery.

967
01:12:35,176 --> 01:12:37,274
Yeah, it's okay.
I guess it's okay.

968
01:12:37,276 --> 01:12:39,041
Uh, let's go, guys.

969
01:12:39,043 --> 01:12:40,907
We've got some more weapons
in the patrol car.

970
01:12:40,909 --> 01:12:43,074
Excuse me,
Officer Ronald Peterson.

971
01:12:43,076 --> 01:12:44,840
Might I request that I have

972
01:12:44,842 --> 01:12:46,876
the use of your own
personal vehicle?

973
01:12:48,876 --> 01:12:50,107
Uh, oh.

974
01:12:50,109 --> 01:12:52,907
Oh, uh... okay.

975
01:12:57,376 --> 01:12:59,974
Oh. <i>Star Wars.</i>

976
01:12:59,976 --> 01:13:01,541
Excellent fiction.

977
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:04,107
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, well, yeah.
- Mm.

978
01:13:04,109 --> 01:13:05,807
It's the, uh...

979
01:13:05,809 --> 01:13:07,241
Red convertible Smart car?

980
01:13:07,243 --> 01:13:09,076
Yes.

981
01:13:17,276 --> 01:13:19,109
Mind how you go.

982
01:13:52,842 --> 01:13:54,943
Slow down a second, Cliff.

983
01:13:59,543 --> 01:14:00,976
Excuse me.

984
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:05,243
Yes.

985
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:09,109
Kill the head.

986
01:14:25,876 --> 01:14:29,840
They gravitate towards things
they did when they were alive.

987
01:14:29,842 --> 01:14:31,208
Yeah.

988
01:14:33,043 --> 01:14:35,907
Tennis girl's kind of cute.

989
01:14:35,909 --> 01:14:37,210
Geez, Cliff.

990
01:14:39,009 --> 01:14:42,107
This is way too creepy.

991
01:14:55,776 --> 01:14:57,774
Oh, God.

992
01:14:57,776 --> 01:15:00,041
I know those kids.

993
01:15:00,043 --> 01:15:02,243
But they're all dead.

994
01:15:10,976 --> 01:15:12,874
Watch it, Cliff.

995
01:15:15,076 --> 01:15:17,541
Did you have to do that?

996
01:15:17,543 --> 01:15:19,208
I'm sorry.
I didn't see him.

997
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:21,541
Well, it doesn't matter, Mindy.

998
01:15:21,543 --> 01:15:23,974
They're already dead.

999
01:15:23,976 --> 01:15:25,974
Well, undead, to be precise.

1000
01:15:25,976 --> 01:15:27,842
Reanimated.

1001
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:33,241
Fucking trespasser.

1002
01:15:33,243 --> 01:15:35,176
Kiss your ass goodbye.

1003
01:15:41,376 --> 01:15:45,276
Oh, shit, where are they all
coming from?

1004
01:16:10,651 --> 01:16:12,549
It seems pretty quiet.

1005
01:16:12,551 --> 01:16:15,749
But door number three is open,
so I'm gonna check it out.

1006
01:16:15,751 --> 01:16:17,816
Let's both check it out.

1007
01:16:17,818 --> 01:16:19,818
Well, I'm coming, too.

1008
01:16:39,051 --> 01:16:41,983
Oh, that's bad.

1009
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,951
Sturgill Simpson.

1010
01:18:14,651 --> 01:18:16,551
Oh, my God.

1011
01:18:19,517 --> 01:18:21,451
Why did you do that?

1012
01:18:23,818 --> 01:18:25,818
They're not zombies.

1013
01:18:27,818 --> 01:18:29,983
They're just dead people.

1014
01:18:29,985 --> 01:18:32,716
Well, yeah, for now, they're
still just dead hipsters,

1015
01:18:32,718 --> 01:18:34,582
but they haven't turned yet.

1016
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:36,049
It can take a while.

1017
01:18:36,051 --> 01:18:37,918
He's right, Mindy.

1018
01:18:39,918 --> 01:18:42,482
Now they're just...

1019
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:46,417
dead hipsters from Cleveland.

1020
01:18:47,684 --> 01:18:49,515
Oh, my God.

1021
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:52,216
I can't.

1022
01:18:52,218 --> 01:18:54,517
My God.

1023
01:19:25,784 --> 01:19:28,784
Well, look at all of you.

1024
01:19:30,885 --> 01:19:32,883
So very ravenous,

1025
01:19:32,885 --> 01:19:36,718
yet well past
your expiration date.

1026
01:19:50,684 --> 01:19:53,618
Oh, man.
Get a load of these two.

1027
01:19:55,018 --> 01:19:57,782
Coffee.

1028
01:19:57,784 --> 01:20:01,618
- Coffee.
- Coffee.

1029
01:20:24,517 --> 01:20:25,949
Oh, God.

1030
01:20:25,951 --> 01:20:28,983
Not that again.

1031
01:20:28,985 --> 01:20:31,449
Sturgill Simpson.

1032
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:35,515
- ♪ Oh, the dead don't die ♪
- Great song.

1033
01:20:35,517 --> 01:20:38,782
♪ Any more than you or I ♪

1034
01:20:38,784 --> 01:20:43,216
♪ They're just ghosts
inside a dream ♪

1035
01:20:43,218 --> 01:20:46,782

1036
01:20:46,784 --> 01:20:50,716
♪ They walk around us
all the time... ♪

1037
01:20:50,718 --> 01:20:53,616
Goddamn it.
I can't take any more.

1038
01:21:00,885 --> 01:21:02,885
That was irrational, Cliff.

1039
01:21:34,851 --> 01:21:36,749
Fuck. Do you think Hank

1040
01:21:36,751 --> 01:21:39,451
and Bobby Wiggins
are still in there?

1041
01:21:41,918 --> 01:21:44,849
Should we try to get 'em out?

1042
01:21:44,851 --> 01:21:47,782
Uh, Cliff, we're drawing
some attention.

1043
01:21:47,784 --> 01:21:50,716
Oh, God, Cliff.

1044
01:21:50,718 --> 01:21:53,216
Please get us out of here.

1045
01:21:53,218 --> 01:21:56,618
Please, Cliff. Please.

1046
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:03,849
That should hold.

1047
01:22:03,851 --> 01:22:05,985
Goddamn zombies, Bobby.

1048
01:22:21,276 --> 01:22:23,407
I know those guys.

1049
01:22:23,409 --> 01:22:25,307
They were two of
my best customers.

1050
01:22:25,309 --> 01:22:27,274
Yeah, yeah, the Good brothers.

1051
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:29,541
Travis and Dallas Good.

1052
01:22:29,543 --> 01:22:32,307
They died in a car crash
some time back.

1053
01:22:32,309 --> 01:22:34,407
Oh, shit.

1054
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:36,608
Yeah, now I remember
those guys.

1055
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:38,674
The Good brothers.

1056
01:22:38,676 --> 01:22:41,307
They were really good guitar pickers.

1057
01:22:41,309 --> 01:22:43,841
That's right.
It's-it's like they came out

1058
01:22:43,843 --> 01:22:48,140
of the birth canal
with guitars in their hands.

1059
01:22:49,543 --> 01:22:53,140
I think you saved my life, man.

1060
01:22:53,142 --> 01:22:54,674
No worries, Hank.

1061
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:02,508
Shit.

1062
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:05,307
- What?
- The fucking back door.

1063
01:23:05,309 --> 01:23:07,374
The back door
to the storage room.

1064
01:23:07,376 --> 01:23:10,543
- What?
- Here.

1065
01:23:12,409 --> 01:23:15,441
Jesus, Bobby.

1066
01:23:15,443 --> 01:23:17,543
Shit.

1067
01:23:21,243 --> 01:23:23,142
There's way too many, Hank.

1068
01:23:25,142 --> 01:23:26,508
This here is a nightmare,
Bobby.

1069
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:28,641
We're goners, man.

1070
01:23:28,643 --> 01:23:32,107
Fuck.

1071
01:24:12,843 --> 01:24:14,574
Come on. Give me that!

1072
01:24:14,576 --> 01:24:16,407
Well, I'll be a monkey's ass.

1073
01:24:18,142 --> 01:24:20,140
It's finally payback time.

1074
01:24:20,142 --> 01:24:22,307
You goddamn refugees!
I'll get all of you!

1075
01:24:22,309 --> 01:24:24,574
You're gonna pay for this!

1076
01:24:28,142 --> 01:24:30,174
Get off my property!

1077
01:24:30,176 --> 01:24:31,474
- Hey! Ow!
- Mmm.

1078
01:24:33,343 --> 01:24:35,343
This is good chicken.

1079
01:24:38,176 --> 01:24:40,140
Damn it! Hey!

1080
01:25:03,209 --> 01:25:05,209
You want to get out and check?

1081
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:10,309
Uh, I'd-I'd rather not.

1082
01:25:13,443 --> 01:25:15,641
Well, that's perfect, isn't it?

1083
01:25:15,643 --> 01:25:18,140
Right in the middle
of the fucking cemetery.

1084
01:25:18,142 --> 01:25:21,508
No, it isn't perfect.

1085
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:24,140
Why did you run over them?

1086
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:31,374
They are not
ordinary pedestrians.

1087
01:25:46,376 --> 01:25:48,376
This is definitely
gonna end badly.

1088
01:25:51,543 --> 01:25:53,543
Shut up, Ronnie.

1089
01:25:55,543 --> 01:25:58,841
No, you shut up.

1090
01:25:58,843 --> 01:26:00,841
Shut up, Ronnie!

1091
01:26:00,843 --> 01:26:04,074
Please stop fighting.

1092
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:06,441
Please.

1093
01:26:06,443 --> 01:26:08,841
Mindy.

1094
01:26:08,843 --> 01:26:11,343
Mindy...

1095
01:26:16,443 --> 01:26:18,209
It's my grandmother.

1096
01:26:19,476 --> 01:26:22,307
Oh, God, Granny.

1097
01:26:22,309 --> 01:26:24,407
- Mindy, Mindy.
- No.

1098
01:26:24,409 --> 01:26:26,608
Mindy, get it together.

1099
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:29,140
It was your grandmother.

1100
01:26:31,676 --> 01:26:35,374
I can't take this anymore.

1101
01:26:35,376 --> 01:26:37,541
I can't do it!

1102
01:26:37,543 --> 01:26:40,209
I'm done with this nightmare.

1103
01:26:42,059 --> 01:26:43,491
Granny, I'm coming.

1104
01:26:43,493 --> 01:26:46,057
- I'm coming.
- Mindy?

1105
01:26:46,059 --> 01:26:47,324
No, Mindy! No, don't!

1106
01:26:47,326 --> 01:26:49,757
Oh, no!

1107
01:26:59,893 --> 01:27:01,891
Holy fuck.

1108
01:27:01,893 --> 01:27:03,926
God help us.

1109
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:41,057
Centerville.

1110
01:27:41,059 --> 01:27:42,759
USA.

1111
01:27:46,093 --> 01:27:48,792
A real nice place.

1112
01:28:02,326 --> 01:28:04,959
What an amusing little machine.

1113
01:28:10,893 --> 01:28:13,160
Oh, here's a curious one.

1114
01:28:21,926 --> 01:28:23,059
Hello there.

1115
01:28:24,859 --> 01:28:26,859
Fashion.

1116
01:28:28,759 --> 01:28:31,792
I can assure you
that is not your tartan.

1117
01:28:33,859 --> 01:28:35,226
Nice neck, though.

1118
01:28:58,893 --> 01:29:01,926
Come on. I know
a safe place we can hide.

1119
01:29:13,893 --> 01:29:15,757
Oh, shit.

1120
01:29:15,759 --> 01:29:17,993
Is that Danny Perkins?
Over here.

1121
01:29:20,326 --> 01:29:23,160
Sure looks like him.

1122
01:29:29,726 --> 01:29:32,824
I'm sorry, Ronnie,
if I've lost it.

1123
01:29:32,826 --> 01:29:35,059
It's okay, Cliff.

1124
01:29:36,093 --> 01:29:39,191
But I got to say,

1125
01:29:39,193 --> 01:29:42,224
you have been acting
a lot different

1126
01:29:42,226 --> 01:29:45,258
since all this weird shit
started happening.

1127
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:47,324
What-what are you
saying, Cliff?

1128
01:29:47,326 --> 01:29:52,291
I'm saying that you seem
so oddly controlled.

1129
01:29:52,293 --> 01:29:55,891
I mean, shit.

1130
01:29:55,893 --> 01:30:00,160
Well, I'm just, you know,
dealing with it in my own way.

1131
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:05,093
But I've been telling you
this is all gonna end badly.

1132
01:30:05,968 --> 01:30:07,966
Goddamn it, Ronnie.

1133
01:30:20,868 --> 01:30:22,899
May I ask you a question?

1134
01:30:22,901 --> 01:30:24,732
Sure. Ask away.

1135
01:30:24,734 --> 01:30:27,933
You have been saying
that this is

1136
01:30:27,935 --> 01:30:31,766
all gonna end badly,
from the very beginning,

1137
01:30:31,768 --> 01:30:33,935
over and over.

1138
01:30:36,567 --> 01:30:39,768
So, what made you
so fucking sure of that?

1139
01:30:41,567 --> 01:30:44,599
How did you know everything
in advance?

1140
01:30:44,601 --> 01:30:46,632
Do you really want to know?

1141
01:30:46,634 --> 01:30:47,966
Yes!

1142
01:30:47,968 --> 01:30:50,565
I want to know.
I really want to know!

1143
01:30:50,567 --> 01:30:53,968
Okay. I know because
I've read the script.

1144
01:30:58,901 --> 01:31:01,565
You...

1145
01:31:01,567 --> 01:31:03,834
read the script.

1146
01:31:05,567 --> 01:31:07,567
The whole script?

1147
01:31:09,768 --> 01:31:11,732
All of it?

1148
01:31:11,734 --> 01:31:14,801
Yeah.
Jim gave me the whole script.

1149
01:31:16,068 --> 01:31:19,501
He only gave me our scenes.

1150
01:31:21,226 --> 01:31:24,691
I never saw a complete script.

1151
01:31:24,693 --> 01:31:28,724
After all... I've done
for that guy.

1152
01:31:28,726 --> 01:31:32,292
And it's a lot that
you don't even know about.

1153
01:31:35,426 --> 01:31:37,824
What a dick.

1154
01:32:14,726 --> 01:32:17,557
That's weird.

1155
01:32:17,559 --> 01:32:19,626
They're all leaving.

1156
01:32:42,726 --> 01:32:45,426
Right. Here we go.

1157
01:33:14,559 --> 01:33:19,557
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

1158
01:33:19,559 --> 01:33:21,693
I think I am.

1159
01:33:27,292 --> 01:33:30,224
Was that in the script?

1160
01:33:30,226 --> 01:33:32,424
No.

1161
01:33:32,426 --> 01:33:34,626
Not the one I read.

1162
01:34:19,393 --> 01:34:22,424
Well, that was unexpected.

1163
01:34:22,426 --> 01:34:27,457
I knew there was something
unusual about her.

1164
01:34:27,459 --> 01:34:29,359
Yeah.

1165
01:34:31,426 --> 01:34:36,290
So, Ronnie,
how does it end, then?

1166
01:34:36,292 --> 01:34:39,426
Well...

1167
01:34:41,559 --> 01:34:45,290
We got to give it
our best shot.

1168
01:34:45,292 --> 01:34:47,290
"Our best shot."

1169
01:34:47,292 --> 01:34:49,824
Okay. Yeah.

1170
01:34:49,826 --> 01:34:53,724
But then it ends badly, right?

1171
01:34:53,726 --> 01:34:55,557
Uh, yeah.

1172
01:34:55,559 --> 01:34:57,326
Yeah, it does.

1173
01:34:58,459 --> 01:35:00,557
Okay, then.

1174
01:35:00,559 --> 01:35:02,559
Let's do it.

1175
01:35:04,459 --> 01:35:06,526
Let's do it.

1176
01:35:35,493 --> 01:35:38,991
<i>Cliff and little Ronnie.</i>

1177
01:35:38,993 --> 01:35:41,758
<i>Warriors.</i>

1178
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,760
<i>Among the dead.</i>

1179
01:35:53,426 --> 01:35:54,426
<i>Zombies.</i>

1180
01:35:56,726 --> 01:35:59,224
<i>Remnants of
the materialist people.</i>

1181
01:36:04,493 --> 01:36:08,290
Oh, no, you don't.
No, you don't.

1182
01:36:10,459 --> 01:36:14,791
<i>I guess they've
been zombies all along.</i>

1183
01:36:14,793 --> 01:36:17,290
<i>Ghosts.</i>

1184
01:36:17,292 --> 01:36:18,626
Oh, hey, Bobby.

1185
01:36:20,459 --> 01:36:21,660
Shit.

1186
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:35,693
<i>"Nameless miseries
of the numberless mortals."</i>

1187
01:36:40,493 --> 01:36:41,758
Frank.

1188
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,557
Hey.

1189
01:36:43,559 --> 01:36:44,726
You got this coming.

1190
01:36:47,368 --> 01:36:49,066
<i>Goodbye, Frank.</i>

1191
01:36:49,068 --> 01:36:50,399
<i>You reap what you sow.</i>

1192
01:36:50,401 --> 01:36:53,368
All right, who's next?

1193
01:36:54,234 --> 01:36:55,268
Ow.

1194
01:36:59,268 --> 01:37:01,101
Yuck.

1195
01:37:03,967 --> 01:37:05,134
All righty.

1196
01:37:09,501 --> 01:37:11,834
Hold your head up.

1197
01:37:17,368 --> 01:37:19,932
Granny.

1198
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:22,965
Mindy would want you
to say hi to Grandpa.

1199
01:37:26,435 --> 01:37:28,335
Ah, Hank.

1200
01:37:30,234 --> 01:37:31,967
I'm so sorry, brother.

1201
01:37:33,068 --> 01:37:35,066
I just can't do it.

1202
01:37:35,068 --> 01:37:37,168
You take care of yourself.

1203
01:37:42,234 --> 01:37:45,199
Danny.

1204
01:37:45,201 --> 01:37:47,234
I just saw Hank.

1205

1208
01:37:55,201 --> 01:37:57,132
Mindy!

1209
01:37:57,134 --> 01:37:58,435
Cliff.

1210
01:38:01,234 --> 01:38:02,299
Ronnie.

1211
01:38:02,301 --> 01:38:03,368
No!

1212
01:38:09,234 --> 01:38:11,435
Jesus, Ronnie.
