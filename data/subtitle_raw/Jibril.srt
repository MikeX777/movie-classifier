00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:18,484
SPRING

2
00:02:50,724 --> 00:02:52,564
Sus, get up.

3
00:02:54,244 --> 00:02:56,284
Good morning, darling.

4
00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:01,444
Get up, darling.

5
00:03:03,004 --> 00:03:04,484
FOR MUM

6
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:12,884
Here.

7
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:23,124
Good morning. - Hi.

8
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:27,724
Why did you sleep in the same bed?

9
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:29,364
Susana was having nightmares.

10
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,484
Done.

11
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,684
Wash your face, Susan.

12
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:37,444
Oh man.

13
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:44,644
Go wake your sister up.

14
00:03:59,684 --> 00:04:01,364
Hey! - Stop daydreaming!

15
00:04:01,364 --> 00:04:02,804
I gotta work. - Get in.

16
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:04,644
I'll walk. - I'll drive you.

17
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:09,444
How you doing? - Good. You?

18
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,124
Hamdulillah.

19
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:15,204
Where are the girls? - At school, where else?

20
00:04:15,684 --> 00:04:17,604
You're looking good. - Thanks.

21
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:20,324
New watch? - No, it's really old.

22
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:23,164
Eyes on the road! - I just haven't worn it for ages.

23
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:26,364
From Murti? - Of course! What do you think?

24
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:28,204
He's a good man, Murti.

25
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:32,324
He treats you like a queen. - Typical Arab man.

26
00:04:32,324 --> 00:04:34,644
It's nice. - Yeah, alhamdulillah.

27
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:36,684
Hamdulillah.

28
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:41,444
No, the one before Real City...

29
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:43,724
This one? - Yeah, that one.

30
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:45,724
You like it, huh? - Turn it up!

31
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:48,284
Drive Sadah!

32
00:05:02,444 --> 00:05:04,564
Good morning.

33
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:07,044
Sorry I'm late. My colleague is off sick.

34
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:08,884
Amir, hi. - Hello.

35
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:12,044
That's the one.

36
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:13,444
You need to...

37
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:16,284
sign here, please. - Yep.

38
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:20,084
Perfect.

39
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:22,964
Here, the fee exemption form.

40
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:29,164
Are they your girls?

41
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:30,844
The girls on the photo. - Yes.

42
00:05:30,844 --> 00:05:31,924
Really?

43
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:34,564
Wow, they're adorable. - Thank you.

44
00:05:34,564 --> 00:05:38,244
They really look like you. I can see you in all of them.

45
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:41,324
Right, I'm going to photocopy this.

46
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:43,884
We don't need this, it's the old one. - OK.

47
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:49,244
My friends play some traditional music... - OK.

48
00:05:49,244 --> 00:05:51,324
They play the oud... - Nice.

49
00:05:51,324 --> 00:05:52,724
Do you play too?

50
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:56,084
I play the flute, but I haven't played for ages.

51
00:05:56,964 --> 00:06:01,844
I thought you might like to come to the party with me.

52
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:05,724
We could have a drink and watch the concert together.

53
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:09,604
I don't have the time, Khaled. Sorry.

54
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,324
"No time. Sorry." - No time.

55
00:08:40,363 --> 00:08:44,164
Good morning, Maryam. - Morning, Abu Jamal. How's it going?

56
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:45,164
Hamdulillah.

57
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:53,644
Have you booked the flights? - Yep.

58
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:56,804
It's still warm. - Grab the garlic sauce.

59
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:59,124
When is your flight? - Thursday.

60
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:00,964
That's not so bad, is it?

61
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:04,084
No, but I've gotso much to do before then.

62
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:09,284
Buying presents? - Yeah. Presents, and loads of paperwork.

63
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:12,364
Be happy you get to see the sun!

64
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:15,884
I am, it's just the difficult circumstances.

65
00:09:15,884 --> 00:09:18,804
Let me know if you need any help. - Sure.

66
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:23,884
Seriously. Don't hesitate. - Yeah, I'll see what I get done.

67
00:09:23,884 --> 00:09:25,244
I'll take care of everything.

68
00:09:29,164 --> 00:09:30,684
Open sesame.

69
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,444
Are the boarding passes on your phone? - Oh...

70
00:09:35,244 --> 00:09:36,604
Have a good journey.

71
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:38,644
Thank you, thank you.

72
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:42,084
Say hi to all the family from me. - Will do.

73
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:43,764
And kiss Beirut for me!

74
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:46,724
Have a last look at your car while it's still nice.

75
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:49,244
Oh, you'll be fine.

76
00:09:49,244 --> 00:09:51,644
And the parcel for Jibril. - Yep.

77
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:55,644
I registered your visit. Don't forget to take your ID.

78
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:58,044
Alright. See you.

79
00:09:58,044 --> 00:09:59,084
Bye.

80
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,084
What's the point?

81
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:26,724
Hi.

82
00:11:28,324 --> 00:11:29,764
Maryam.

83
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:30,844
I know.

84
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:34,524
We've seen each other before.

85
00:11:35,684 --> 00:11:37,444
At the wedding.

86
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:40,804
It was a while ago, you were wearing a blue dress.

87
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:41,804
Yep.

88
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:49,604
I handed in your parcel from Sadah. - Thanks.

89
00:11:49,604 --> 00:11:52,044
She's really sorry. - It's fine.

90
00:11:52,484 --> 00:11:56,124
Did Murti fly over with her to Beirut? - Yeah, it's his uncle.

91
00:12:08,204 --> 00:12:10,324
It's crazy getting in here.

92
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:15,124
Getting out's even crazier.

93
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:28,164
What do you do in here all day?

94
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:35,484
Sit around.

95
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:38,484
Read.

96
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:40,404
Exercise.

97
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:44,484
I'm doing an apprenticeship as a locksmith.

98
00:12:44,484 --> 00:12:46,564
Learning to break into places?

99
00:12:49,324 --> 00:12:52,124
I'm also in this group with a priest.

100
00:12:52,124 --> 00:12:54,044
Or pastor... no, he's a priest.

101
00:12:54,964 --> 00:12:55,964
Sorry.

102
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:03,164
He's the only person who understands what's going on here.

103
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:09,844
I'm trying to do my A-levels, and he's helping me with that.

104
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:11,764
A-levels? - Yeah.

105
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:12,884
Cool.

106
00:13:13,844 --> 00:13:14,964
Jibril.

107
00:13:16,724 --> 00:13:18,204
Jibril...

108
00:13:18,204 --> 00:13:20,084
It's a nice name.

109
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:22,044
It's nice the way you say it.

110
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:25,724
Don't you speak Arabic? - Only a little bit.

111
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:34,084
My dad didn't really want us to...

112
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:37,644
speak Arabic.

113
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:40,484
He wanted us to speak German, so we felt like we belonged.

114
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:42,244
I can speak both.

115
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:45,364
That's you.

116
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:48,524
But... I can still learn it.

117
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:54,484
I brought you some chocolate. - Thanks.

118
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:57,324
I was hoping it was for me.

119
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,404
I have to get going.

120
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:16,524
Are you gonna come again?

121
00:14:17,284 --> 00:14:19,284
It was an honour, Jibril.

122
00:14:29,684 --> 00:14:30,684
Thanks.

123
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:35,804
When one door closes, the other will open.

124
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:37,524
Have a nice day. Thanks. You too.

125
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:41,604
Have a nice day. - Bye.

126
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:16,364
Shall I...? - We're about to eat.

127
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:18,644
But not the yellow stuff! - Right.

128
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:20,884
What do you want? - Rice.

129
00:15:21,764 --> 00:15:24,204
Do you want the rest?

130
00:15:24,204 --> 00:15:25,284
No?

131
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:26,444
Not that much!

132
00:15:27,004 --> 00:15:29,004
Not so much. - Stop!

133
00:15:29,004 --> 00:15:30,564
That's enough.

134
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:35,284
Peppers too, Elin?

135
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,724
How was your day?

136
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:41,164
What did you do? - Nothing special.

137
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:44,204
How was your day at Dad's?

138
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:45,484
Chilled.

139
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:48,684
So you watched TV all day? - No.

140
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:51,324
What did you do then? - We went out.

141
00:15:51,844 --> 00:15:54,044
We played... - Then what?

142
00:15:54,044 --> 00:15:56,164
I told you, we went out.

143
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,764
You had a good time then?

144
00:16:03,324 --> 00:16:05,684
Did you clean for him after that?

145
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:06,884
No!

146
00:16:09,684 --> 00:16:12,004
Seriously, Sus. Don't lie to me.

147
00:16:12,644 --> 00:16:14,844
Stop fighting all the time. - We're not.

148
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:17,724
Just tell me. I want to know what you did. - No.

149
00:16:17,724 --> 00:16:19,724
You're my daughter. - So?

150
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:22,044
Are you my daughter? Yes or no.

151
00:16:22,044 --> 00:16:24,204
And my father is my father.

152
00:16:25,244 --> 00:16:28,844
I don't want you vacuuming for him. - What's it to you?

153
00:16:28,844 --> 00:16:31,764
I wanna know what you've been doing. Sus! - Man!

154
00:16:34,204 --> 00:16:36,044
Give me that. - Can't I keep it?

155
00:16:36,044 --> 00:16:37,764
No, give it to me, please.

156
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:48,204
Want a cup of tea or something?

157
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:50,364
I could make some peppermint tea.

158
00:16:51,764 --> 00:16:53,604
I'll go upstairs in a bit.

159
00:16:56,364 --> 00:17:00,044
She said she'd call tonight. - It's already 9:15.

160
00:17:00,044 --> 00:17:01,724
She won't call anyway.

161
00:17:01,724 --> 00:17:04,764
I can't imagine my daughters not talking to me...

162
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:06,604
Do a better job than me then.

163
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:11,444
You can see what she's like when she gets back from her Dad's.

164
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:13,283
She's close to him.

165
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:15,684
That's just how it is.

166
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:20,563
Girls are always close to their dads.

167
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:22,684
Mine is the same. That's the way it is.

168
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:32,804
SUMMER

169
00:17:32,804 --> 00:17:34,364
Morning check!

170
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,084
Say something.

171
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:35,684
How's your Arabic coming along?

172
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:39,004
Not great.

173
00:18:39,004 --> 00:18:41,604
Did you even start? - Not really.

174
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:43,644
You can't be bothered?

175
00:18:44,644 --> 00:18:46,604
How are your kids?

176
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:49,404
Susana's giving me a tough time, but they're good.

177
00:18:49,404 --> 00:18:51,404
Yara's Arabic is really good.

178
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,324
Really? - Yep.

179
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:55,844
And Susana? - She can't be bothered.

180
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:58,604
She's more into her private life. - The old one?

181
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:02,164
Susana's the oldest one, Yara's the middle one.

182
00:19:02,164 --> 00:19:04,484
Twelve. - Susana's twelve, yep.

183
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:06,444
Pretty old.

184
00:20:01,444 --> 00:20:03,524
The coffee should be over there.

185
00:20:15,044 --> 00:20:17,444
Mr Martin, is the coffee on? - Yep.

186
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:19,644
Let's get started then.

187
00:20:19,644 --> 00:20:22,484
It's nice to see you all here once again.

188
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:25,764
Let us give thanks for the companionship,

189
00:20:25,764 --> 00:20:29,404
and for what we talk about, think about and feel.

190
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:33,364
May the Lord be with us. Amen. - Amen.

191
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:36,164
I just got this article.

192
00:20:36,164 --> 00:20:39,884
We talked about relationships in our last two sessions,

193
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:42,564
and about our desires,

194
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:46,684
and Mr Martin, you found something interesting.

195
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:52,764
So, Mr Martin, do you think relationships stand a chance in prison?

196
00:20:52,764 --> 00:20:56,324
Yes and no. Maybe a tiny percentage of them work out.

197
00:20:57,444 --> 00:21:00,804
But generally, speaking from personal experience,

198
00:21:00,804 --> 00:21:02,204
no.

199
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:06,444
Do you have a girlfriend, Mr Böhm? - Not anymore.

200
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:08,764
It lasted for a year.

201
00:21:08,764 --> 00:21:11,524
Then we split upafter I got put in prison.

202
00:21:12,444 --> 00:21:15,404
Did you split up by mutual consent?

203
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:17,244
Yes, we...

204
00:21:17,244 --> 00:21:19,444
She came here for a long-term visit,

205
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:24,124
but we decided a two-hour visit once a month wasn't enough.

206
00:21:24,124 --> 00:21:27,404
Imagine seeing your wife only two hours a month.

207
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:30,124
So we said we'd take a break for the time being.

208
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:33,884
And what happens when I'm out is another story.

209
00:21:40,004 --> 00:21:41,844
Your cornflakes are ready.

210
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:44,444
Mum's eating your cornflakes! - So?

211
00:21:46,124 --> 00:21:47,724
Cornflakes thief!

212
00:21:49,164 --> 00:21:50,764
Good morning.

213
00:21:51,884 --> 00:21:54,124
How's it going? Did you sleep well?

214
00:21:54,404 --> 00:21:56,164
We're having breakfast.

215
00:21:56,964 --> 00:21:58,164
Cornflakes.

216
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:00,484
Wanna speak to him? - I do!

217
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:03,484
Susan.

218
00:22:03,484 --> 00:22:05,084
I'm Jibril.

219
00:22:06,164 --> 00:22:08,524
I guess your Mum told you about me.

220
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:15,244
Good. Yeah, put her on. - OK.

221
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:17,604
Hello.

222
00:22:18,564 --> 00:22:19,884
Hello.

223
00:22:20,764 --> 00:22:22,244
Yara.

224
00:22:22,244 --> 00:22:24,404
Yara! With an "R".

225
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:28,844
With an "R"! Yara.

226
00:22:31,164 --> 00:22:33,084
Give me the phone!

227
00:22:38,284 --> 00:22:40,084
See you sometime soon.

228
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,124
You too? - Yeah.

229
00:22:43,124 --> 00:22:45,284
Here. - Good morning.

230
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:55,324
"Good morning!"

231
00:22:59,884 --> 00:23:02,364
Hello? I'm Elin.

232
00:23:03,524 --> 00:23:05,244
Give it to me.

233
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:11,124
They're sweet.

234
00:23:13,604 --> 00:23:15,524
They're laughing at me.

235
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:21,644
Bye.

236
00:23:35,844 --> 00:23:37,764
No, thanks.

237
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:41,084
Just try it, a few vitamins will do you good.

238
00:23:44,444 --> 00:23:45,564
Yummy.

239
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,124
They're really nice. - Yep.

240
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:52,244
I like them too.

241
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:55,604
Where'd you get them? - Downstairs.

242
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:00,564
Have you heard from your cousin?

243
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,804
Samira? - Yeah.

244
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,284
She's marrying some loser.

245
00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:07,644
He's got no job, nothing...

246
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:11,884
I'm sure she knows what she's doing. - What's that supposed to mean?

247
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:14,804
He's a waster.

248
00:24:14,804 --> 00:24:17,604
How can she marry someone who's such a failure?

249
00:24:20,244 --> 00:24:23,244
If she's happy, she's happy. - "Happy", what does that mean?

250
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:25,444
Mum, she's in love.

251
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:29,244
Love blossoms over time, my child.

252
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:35,044
It's not something that's just there.

253
00:24:35,044 --> 00:24:38,204
A man needs to be able to provide for his family.

254
00:24:40,284 --> 00:24:42,284
But she has a job.

255
00:24:42,284 --> 00:24:45,244
Does she have to work to provide for him then?

256
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:48,844
But she loves him.

257
00:24:49,764 --> 00:24:51,724
And that's enough, is it?

258
00:24:52,484 --> 00:24:55,244
Sometimes it is. - Well, it's not.

259
00:24:55,964 --> 00:24:58,284
You can fall in love very quickly,

260
00:24:58,284 --> 00:25:02,964
but true love grows and stays with you, like me and your father...

261
00:25:02,964 --> 00:25:05,844
he loved and respected me, we got through a lot together.

262
00:25:05,844 --> 00:25:08,284
God bless him. - God bless him.

263
00:25:47,244 --> 00:25:49,044
No ice cream!

264
00:25:49,484 --> 00:25:51,444
You're back already?

265
00:25:51,444 --> 00:25:53,644
I thought you were at work.

266
00:25:53,644 --> 00:25:55,764
Oh God, what are you wearing?

267
00:25:56,884 --> 00:25:59,084
Are you serious? - Yeah...

268
00:25:59,564 --> 00:26:01,604
Why do you look like a clown?

269
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:06,204
You've eaten all the ice creams. Yara! - Leave us alone!

270
00:26:06,204 --> 00:26:08,004
We're allowed.

271
00:26:10,724 --> 00:26:12,084
You clown!

272
00:26:12,644 --> 00:26:13,644
Fuck.

273
00:26:16,604 --> 00:26:19,564
Did you have an ice cream too? - I didn't.

274
00:26:19,564 --> 00:26:21,844
Hey, did you eat four ice creams?

275
00:26:21,844 --> 00:26:25,444
What are you doing back already? - I didn't go in.

276
00:26:25,444 --> 00:26:28,364
You got all dolled up for that? What's your game?

277
00:26:28,364 --> 00:26:31,124
What? - Leave me alone!

278
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:32,364
What's up with Susana?

279
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:36,484
How should I know? She's always like this. - She's not.

280
00:26:36,484 --> 00:26:37,884
Sure she is.

281
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:42,564
Talk to me. - I didn't go in.

282
00:26:42,564 --> 00:26:46,604
Oh, you didn't, did you? That's good to know.

283
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,764
I don't want them eating ice creams before dinner, OK?

284
00:26:49,764 --> 00:26:51,124
The state of this place!

285
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,604
How about a smile?

286
00:27:00,604 --> 00:27:02,364
How was maths? - Good.

287
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,804
What does that mean? - I got a C.

288
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:08,124
Hey! We're over here.

289
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:13,324
How was your day? - Good.

290
00:27:16,404 --> 00:27:19,124
Shall we do something fun? - The funfair!

291
00:27:19,124 --> 00:27:20,964
The funfair? - Is Maggi coming?

292
00:27:20,964 --> 00:27:23,444
Us four and one of my students. - How old?

293
00:27:23,444 --> 00:27:24,564
He's a grown-up.

294
00:27:24,564 --> 00:27:25,564
Brilliant.

295
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:27,644
You too? - Yeah!

296
00:27:27,644 --> 00:27:29,164
Come over here then.

297
00:27:29,164 --> 00:27:31,444
She's allowed on too, right?

298
00:27:32,564 --> 00:27:34,724
How much for three children?

299
00:27:34,724 --> 00:27:36,004
And Khaled?

300
00:27:36,004 --> 00:27:38,364
Are you going on with them? - Me?

301
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:39,404
Yeah!

302
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:59,084
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome on board.

303
00:27:59,084 --> 00:28:02,244
Enjoy your ride on the carousel and...

304
00:28:02,244 --> 00:28:04,964
have fun!

305
00:28:19,404 --> 00:28:22,564
How are we all doing? Are you feeling it?

306
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:28,204
Okey dokey, let's pump it up to the top!

307
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,164
Hello, Maryam Abdul-Karim speaking.

308
00:28:41,164 --> 00:28:43,444
I'd like to speak to Mr Issa.

309
00:28:45,164 --> 00:28:46,604
Gabriel Issa.

310
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:52,324
He's one of the prisoners,on ward 4.

311
00:28:56,004 --> 00:28:58,524
2-4-6-3-6-8-7.

312
00:28:59,964 --> 00:29:01,084
Yes.

313
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:02,404
Thanks. Bye.

314
00:30:18,244 --> 00:30:19,244
Thanks.

315
00:30:21,964 --> 00:30:23,764
Last time I got four.

316
00:30:23,764 --> 00:30:26,764
Yeah, I haven't figured the machine out yet.

317
00:30:28,204 --> 00:30:29,484
It's fine.

318
00:30:32,284 --> 00:30:34,524
Open the present, it's for you.

319
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:37,804
Looks like someone already did.

320
00:30:38,524 --> 00:30:41,044
Yeah, I wrapped it up really nicely,

321
00:30:41,484 --> 00:30:43,164
but, yeah, they...

322
00:30:43,804 --> 00:30:46,164
...ripped it a bit. They always do that.

323
00:30:46,164 --> 00:30:48,084
Yeah, they opened it.

324
00:30:48,084 --> 00:30:49,524
Open it.

325
00:30:51,244 --> 00:30:52,524
Later.

326
00:30:53,524 --> 00:30:56,764
I want it to be a surprise when I'm back in my cell.

327
00:30:56,764 --> 00:30:57,844
OK?

328
00:31:11,084 --> 00:31:13,564
I wanted to come last Thursday.

329
00:31:13,564 --> 00:31:15,004
Where were you?

330
00:31:16,524 --> 00:31:18,204
In the car.

331
00:31:24,364 --> 00:31:26,124
What? - You alright?

332
00:31:26,124 --> 00:31:28,244
I'm good. You? - Yep.

333
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:30,204
I'm good.

334
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:31,804
Did you just have a shower?

335
00:31:35,404 --> 00:31:36,764
Nice.

336
00:31:54,124 --> 00:31:55,684
Why are you so far away?

337
00:32:01,204 --> 00:32:04,324
You know what you looked like up there at the wedding?

338
00:32:05,284 --> 00:32:07,004
Like King Kong!

339
00:32:16,244 --> 00:32:19,124
Don't, or we'll get thrown out.

340
00:32:19,124 --> 00:32:21,284
Well, I will. You won't.

341
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:50,604
That's enough.

342
00:33:14,444 --> 00:33:16,284
What are we doing here?

343
00:33:22,604 --> 00:33:23,684
Sorry.

344
00:33:25,324 --> 00:33:27,164
I didn't mean to meddle.

345
00:33:28,124 --> 00:33:30,004
I'm just worried about you.

346
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:35,124
You just got rid of one bastard, but not his debts.

347
00:33:35,124 --> 00:33:37,244
Don't worry, I won't bring another bastard home.

348
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:39,084
But I do worry.

349
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:42,204
Where's this gonna go next?

350
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,604
I can see how you're acting weird.

351
00:33:53,284 --> 00:33:55,044
You never let me do my thing.

352
00:33:55,804 --> 00:33:57,804
Do your thing?

353
00:33:57,804 --> 00:34:00,324
Deal with your shit yourself then.

354
00:35:36,124 --> 00:35:39,204
I know it's totally stupid, but I'm in front of the building.

355
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:40,204
Seriously.

356
00:35:43,564 --> 00:35:46,444
I had this mad yearning for you today.

357
00:36:12,844 --> 00:36:14,724
She's on WhatsApp again.

358
00:36:14,724 --> 00:36:17,884
Sorry, but I have a life. - And we don't?

359
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,204
You're our mother, that's your life.

360
00:36:20,204 --> 00:36:23,124
That's precisely the problem. - Yeah...

361
00:36:27,524 --> 00:36:29,964
So? What's been happening?

362
00:36:31,484 --> 00:36:33,444
What do you want to know?

363
00:36:33,444 --> 00:36:35,364
You're looking good.

364
00:36:35,364 --> 00:36:36,884
You are, wallah!

365
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,324
Tell me.

366
00:36:43,204 --> 00:36:44,244
It's good.

367
00:36:46,284 --> 00:36:47,644
Give me money.

368
00:36:47,644 --> 00:36:51,764
Money? What for? - To buy something.

369
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:52,884
I saw.

370
00:36:53,604 --> 00:36:55,524
What do you want to buy?

371
00:36:56,044 --> 00:36:57,964
Sweets.

372
00:36:57,964 --> 00:36:59,444
Thanks.

373
00:36:59,444 --> 00:37:00,804
OK, bye.

374
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:02,804
Take your sister with you.

375
00:37:05,084 --> 00:37:07,084
Does it feel good? - Yeah.

376
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:10,364
What are you gonna do now?

377
00:37:10,364 --> 00:37:12,284
Go on holiday, of course!

378
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,244
Good evening.

379
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:02,244
How's it going?

380
00:38:04,644 --> 00:38:05,764
Sorry?

381
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,004
I'm good, I'm just watching...

382
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:11,644
"The Eyes of the Heart".

383
00:38:17,204 --> 00:38:18,404
Crazy.

384
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:20,204
You understand everything.

385
00:38:26,164 --> 00:38:28,684
It all turns pretty dramatic after that.

386
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,724
Right.

387
00:38:31,564 --> 00:38:34,684
They're not allowed to be together anymore.

388
00:38:36,884 --> 00:38:37,884
Yep.

389
00:38:43,244 --> 00:38:45,124
You're so cute.

390
00:38:48,844 --> 00:38:50,644
You just are...

391
00:38:52,404 --> 00:38:54,444
I'd love to kiss you now.

392
00:39:00,764 --> 00:39:02,124
Hello?

393
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:05,084
Are you still there?

394
00:39:06,004 --> 00:39:08,044
Did you hear what I just said?

395
00:39:12,604 --> 00:39:14,684
Well? - I miss you.

396
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,804
Really.

397
00:39:45,964 --> 00:39:47,724
Why are you moping around the place?

398
00:39:48,484 --> 00:39:49,964
I'm fine.

399
00:39:49,964 --> 00:39:52,244
At least do some bums, tums, thighs.

400
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:04,524
What a machine!

401
00:42:51,324 --> 00:42:52,884
AUTUMN

402
00:43:15,124 --> 00:43:18,964
Can't you walk a bit slower? - This is slow.

403
00:43:19,724 --> 00:43:21,764
It's not slow, it's fast. - It is slow!

404
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:31,444
He's not gonna open up.

405
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:35,484
Why not? - Something about some bills.

406
00:43:35,484 --> 00:43:38,124
What bills? - I dunno, bills.

407
00:43:39,364 --> 00:43:40,804
Why's he not opening?

408
00:43:42,524 --> 00:43:44,244
What's that? - My code.

409
00:43:44,244 --> 00:43:46,524
Do you know the code too? - No, only I do.

410
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:49,284
Do your code again then. - Go on!

411
00:43:51,244 --> 00:43:53,804
He's not gonna answer, forget it.

412
00:43:53,804 --> 00:43:56,244
He's at home. He'll answer in a bit.

413
00:43:56,724 --> 00:43:58,164
Get off.

414
00:43:58,164 --> 00:44:00,844
You're so annoying. - Look who's talking.

415
00:44:03,084 --> 00:44:05,004
Just go up and knock, OK?

416
00:44:06,684 --> 00:44:10,564
If you hadn't taken my phone off me I could've called him.

417
00:44:15,204 --> 00:44:16,444
Hello? - Yes?

418
00:44:17,204 --> 00:44:19,404
Could you open the door, please?

419
00:44:19,684 --> 00:44:21,124
Get in.

420
00:44:21,124 --> 00:44:24,444
Bang on the door, he might be asleep. OK? - Yes!

421
00:44:36,444 --> 00:44:38,524
I was told to say hi.

422
00:44:38,524 --> 00:44:41,004
Who by? - Murti and Sadah.

423
00:44:42,804 --> 00:44:44,164
Those two...

424
00:44:44,844 --> 00:44:48,804
They never come and visit me anymore. - They're busy.

425
00:44:48,804 --> 00:44:50,724
They're always travelling.

426
00:44:53,084 --> 00:44:55,444
Sure, travelling... still in China?

427
00:44:56,084 --> 00:44:57,084
Dubai.

428
00:45:11,204 --> 00:45:13,364
How are your A-levels going?

429
00:45:13,364 --> 00:45:15,204
I stopped that.

430
00:45:17,004 --> 00:45:19,444
I dunno... I'm gonna do something else.

431
00:45:20,004 --> 00:45:21,724
I might study architecture.

432
00:45:21,724 --> 00:45:24,444
You can't do a degree without A-levels.

433
00:45:26,444 --> 00:45:28,084
Who says I can't?

434
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:35,764
How are your daughters?

435
00:45:36,084 --> 00:45:37,084
Good.

436
00:45:38,484 --> 00:45:39,484
Great.

437
00:45:41,444 --> 00:45:42,604
Nice.

438
00:45:42,604 --> 00:45:44,564
They're asking about you.

439
00:45:45,484 --> 00:45:46,484
Seriously?

440
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:48,444
Cool.

441
00:45:49,524 --> 00:45:51,444
They could come visit me.

442
00:45:55,724 --> 00:45:57,364
Why not?

443
00:46:09,444 --> 00:46:10,524
Fuck.

444
00:46:26,804 --> 00:46:28,244
Hello, Mum.

445
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,404
Hello. Sorry.

446
00:46:31,204 --> 00:46:33,124
Come on. Susana!

447
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,284
Put the tablet away. - OK.

448
00:46:35,284 --> 00:46:39,044
I'm so sorry, Mum. I really thought he was at home.

449
00:46:39,044 --> 00:46:40,524
Was it hard work?

450
00:46:41,324 --> 00:46:45,444
Are you tired? I'll make you some tea. - No.

451
00:46:45,444 --> 00:46:47,804
Can I get you anything?

452
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:50,644
No, I'm alright. Don't worry. - Bye.

453
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:02,364
Sorry. Bye.

454
00:47:23,484 --> 00:47:26,324
I know it's totally stupid, but I'm in front of the building.

455
00:47:26,324 --> 00:47:27,604
Seriously.

456
00:47:29,604 --> 00:47:32,484
I had this mad yearning for you today.

457
00:47:34,524 --> 00:47:36,004
I'm here.

458
00:47:36,004 --> 00:47:37,844
Can you feel it?

459
00:47:41,404 --> 00:47:42,804
Cell inspection.

460
00:47:46,644 --> 00:47:48,964
Where's your phone? - I don't have one.

461
00:48:20,124 --> 00:48:25,164
You know mobile phones are not permitted.

462
00:48:25,164 --> 00:48:30,604
We must assume it was smuggled in and you have violated the house rules.

463
00:48:30,604 --> 00:48:33,404
It will have consequences regarding your release.

464
00:48:33,404 --> 00:48:37,524
We were all set to taking steps towards your release next week.

465
00:48:37,524 --> 00:48:39,444
We were going to review your situation,

466
00:48:39,444 --> 00:48:44,524
and take steps towards your release if the assessment was positive.

467
00:48:44,524 --> 00:48:47,084
But that's all down the drain now.

468
00:48:49,164 --> 00:48:51,484
There's nothing we can do? - No.

469
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:57,044
You've been here for three years now.

470
00:48:57,044 --> 00:48:58,764
Everything was going well.

471
00:48:58,764 --> 00:49:03,484
You've been working regularly, your urine samples have all been negative.

472
00:49:03,484 --> 00:49:07,444
No complaints about your behaviour.

473
00:49:07,964 --> 00:49:10,604
We have a plan. You have prospects.

474
00:49:14,764 --> 00:49:16,604
Say something.

475
00:49:16,604 --> 00:49:18,564
Right. I get it.

476
00:49:19,444 --> 00:49:20,804
Just go then.

477
00:50:09,124 --> 00:50:10,684
Wanker.

478
00:50:13,204 --> 00:50:14,404
Shut it!

479
00:50:16,284 --> 00:50:17,844
Fuck off.

480
00:50:22,404 --> 00:50:24,124
Hey, babe. It's me.

481
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,564
Why aren't you picking up?

482
00:50:42,884 --> 00:50:46,084
You hear they'reconfiscating mobiles on 4B?

483
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:50,004
Yep. You're a bit late though, they took mine yesterday.

484
00:50:50,804 --> 00:50:51,804
Serious?

485
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,604
Thanks for the chocolate.

486
00:51:00,604 --> 00:51:02,444
All white today.

487
00:51:05,684 --> 00:51:06,684
True.

488
00:51:13,124 --> 00:51:14,964
You cool? - I'm cool.

489
00:51:14,964 --> 00:51:16,804
Everything's cool.

490
00:51:16,804 --> 00:51:20,284
Everything's been cool for three years, just three to go.

491
00:51:20,284 --> 00:51:22,284
Cool every fucking day.

492
00:51:24,324 --> 00:51:26,164
It's all good.

493
00:51:26,164 --> 00:51:28,724
What's going on with you? - Loads.

494
00:51:29,244 --> 00:51:31,524
Eid al-Fitr is coming up.

495
00:51:31,524 --> 00:51:35,684
We decorated the whole flat yesterday. It looks so stupid.

496
00:51:35,684 --> 00:51:39,164
Murti brought so much junk back with him. Proper junk.

497
00:51:39,164 --> 00:51:40,604
For the kids.

498
00:51:40,604 --> 00:51:43,364
Murti's back? - Yep. The day before yesterday.

499
00:51:43,364 --> 00:51:46,044
You don't give a shit about how I'm doing? - Huh?

500
00:51:46,044 --> 00:51:48,724
You don't give a shit about how I'm doing?

501
00:51:49,044 --> 00:51:50,764
What's wrong, Jibril?

502
00:51:52,164 --> 00:51:54,444
What's wrong with you lot, more like.

503
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,524
I just sit here waiting for shit.

504
00:51:56,524 --> 00:51:58,764
I'm a bit stressed right now.

505
00:51:58,764 --> 00:52:00,964
School's starting again.

506
00:52:00,964 --> 00:52:02,844
You're stressed?

507
00:52:02,844 --> 00:52:04,484
About what?

508
00:52:04,804 --> 00:52:06,444
I am, yes.

509
00:52:06,444 --> 00:52:08,284
That's why you don't pick up? - Yep.

510
00:52:08,284 --> 00:52:10,844
And they don't visit me... - I only don't pick up if it's you.

511
00:52:10,844 --> 00:52:12,484
Thought so.

512
00:52:12,484 --> 00:52:14,564
You're absolutely...

513
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:15,884
spot-on.

514
00:52:15,884 --> 00:52:17,404
Go then.

515
00:52:18,364 --> 00:52:20,004
What's wrong, Jibril? - Go.

516
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:21,884
Seriously, what's up? - Go.

517
00:52:21,884 --> 00:52:23,844
Say hi to Murti and Sadah.

518
00:52:23,844 --> 00:52:25,444
I'm here now, Jibril.

519
00:52:26,724 --> 00:52:28,604
Has something happened?

520
00:52:37,764 --> 00:52:40,404
You like hanging out with my friends, huh?

521
00:52:41,564 --> 00:52:42,564
Yeah...

522
00:52:43,284 --> 00:52:45,804
We're going to a spa together next week.

523
00:52:52,684 --> 00:52:55,644
I don't want your chocolate, to be honest.

524
00:53:08,444 --> 00:53:11,044
I'll take them with me, no worries.

525
00:53:11,524 --> 00:53:12,964
Go.

526
00:53:27,044 --> 00:53:28,044
Go.

527
00:53:34,324 --> 00:53:35,764
Move it.

528
00:53:36,244 --> 00:53:38,124
You're pissing me off.

529
00:53:59,964 --> 00:54:01,484
Fucking prick.

530
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,524
What can I do for you, Mr Issa?

531
00:54:54,084 --> 00:54:56,284
The phone thing... it's really shit.

532
00:54:59,444 --> 00:55:02,084
Did you have your disciplinary meeting?

533
00:55:02,804 --> 00:55:04,284
Yep. - And?

534
00:55:05,004 --> 00:55:06,524
It didn't go well.

535
00:55:09,564 --> 00:55:11,284
I want to call my girlfriend.

536
00:55:11,284 --> 00:55:13,004
Miss Abdul-Karim? - Right.

537
00:55:21,844 --> 00:55:23,444
Yeah, but...

538
00:55:24,204 --> 00:55:27,244
What do you mean by that? - I dunno, Jibril.

539
00:55:34,004 --> 00:55:36,244
I dunno. I need some space.

540
00:55:39,524 --> 00:55:41,964
Whatever, I need to get out.

541
00:55:42,764 --> 00:55:46,084
You need to get out? I need to get out, Maryam. Fuck you.

542
00:55:46,684 --> 00:55:48,044
Mr Issa.

543
00:55:48,844 --> 00:55:50,484
That's not possible.

544
00:55:51,524 --> 00:55:53,404
What's the problem?

545
00:55:54,204 --> 00:55:55,964
I dunno.

546
00:55:56,364 --> 00:55:59,004
Why didn't you tell her that they...

547
00:56:00,004 --> 00:56:01,844
confiscated your phone?

548
00:56:04,124 --> 00:56:06,724
I wanted to, but it's...

549
00:56:08,244 --> 00:56:09,804
It's not that easy.

550
00:56:48,164 --> 00:56:50,124
You're doing good, yeah?

551
00:56:50,124 --> 00:56:52,884
You can do whatever you want, and just go,

552
00:56:52,884 --> 00:56:57,524
while I'm left waiting here like an idiot,talking to your fucking mailbox.

553
00:56:57,524 --> 00:56:59,124
I wish you had never come.

554
00:57:14,044 --> 00:57:15,764
Because she has to...

555
00:57:15,764 --> 00:57:17,084
OK. Right, bye.

556
00:57:19,484 --> 00:57:22,164
Good morning. - A very good morning.

557
00:57:22,164 --> 00:57:23,764
I passed B1.

558
00:57:24,804 --> 00:57:26,044
Congratulations.

559
00:57:27,324 --> 00:57:30,644
I actually came to ask you... - Persistent, huh?

560
00:57:30,644 --> 00:57:32,164
Huh? - Persistent.

561
00:57:32,164 --> 00:57:35,084
It means "pigheaded". But not in a bad way.

562
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:37,324
I'll take it as a compliment then.

563
00:59:34,724 --> 00:59:39,244
I don't know what's up with me. But it's not you, it's me.

564
00:59:39,244 --> 00:59:41,444
Sorry for being such a dick.

565
00:59:45,524 --> 00:59:46,764
OK...

566
00:59:50,604 --> 00:59:52,204
I was just...

567
00:59:53,284 --> 00:59:55,164
acting like a wanker.

568
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:02,644
I dunno.

569
01:00:04,884 --> 01:00:06,444
I dunno, Jibril.

570
01:00:13,684 --> 01:00:14,684
Bye.

571
01:03:41,564 --> 01:03:43,324
Great to see you.

572
01:04:06,724 --> 01:04:08,324
Let's get married.

573
01:04:08,324 --> 01:04:10,684
What? - Get married.

574
01:04:11,444 --> 01:04:13,324
But I'm in jail.

575
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:17,084
Are you serious?

576
01:04:18,804 --> 01:04:20,524
What about your mum?

577
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:22,444
She's gonna freak out.

578
01:04:29,004 --> 01:04:31,204
The things you come up with!

579
01:04:34,324 --> 01:04:36,124
WINTER

580
01:04:39,364 --> 01:04:41,204
Wow!

581
01:04:41,204 --> 01:04:43,764
My princess! Cake?

582
01:04:45,764 --> 01:04:47,404
Are you nervous?

583
01:04:48,124 --> 01:04:49,804
Yeah, a little.

584
01:04:50,484 --> 01:04:52,564
Really? - Well...

585
01:04:54,364 --> 01:04:56,484
Shall I put some make-up on you?

586
01:05:00,964 --> 01:05:03,364
He's lucky to get you. - Definitely.

587
01:05:03,364 --> 01:05:08,004
You've only got 20 percent battery. - Put it on power-saving mode.

588
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,164
I managed to get off work early,

589
01:05:10,684 --> 01:05:13,444
glad I made it.

590
01:05:15,204 --> 01:05:16,884
That must be the imam.

591
01:05:16,884 --> 01:05:19,644
Hey, Sus. Put that away.

592
01:05:19,644 --> 01:05:21,964
Now!- Give me those toys.

593
01:05:22,444 --> 01:05:25,404
As-Salaam-Alaikum. - Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.

594
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:27,524
Please come in.

595
01:05:35,644 --> 01:05:38,723
Right. Now we're going to speak to Mr Issa.

596
01:05:39,723 --> 01:05:41,004
On the phone.

597
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:43,324
He's going to ring any second now.

598
01:05:44,364 --> 01:05:46,044
OK. Let's wait.

599
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:53,444
This is certainly unique.

600
01:05:53,444 --> 01:05:56,684
You don't often get marriages like this one.

601
01:05:56,684 --> 01:05:58,164
But...

602
01:05:58,444 --> 01:05:59,444
Hello.

603
01:06:00,244 --> 01:06:01,764
It's me.

604
01:06:06,644 --> 01:06:08,444
Shall we get started?

605
01:06:08,444 --> 01:06:10,284
Yep, let's get started.

606
01:06:12,124 --> 01:06:15,244
Hello, brother Jibril. How are you?

607
01:06:15,884 --> 01:06:17,644
Good, I hope.

608
01:06:18,444 --> 01:06:20,884
I will start with a small reading.

609
01:06:49,684 --> 01:06:53,364
Maryam, daughter of Abdul Karim Majid,

610
01:06:53,364 --> 01:06:55,404
I will now ask you

611
01:06:55,404 --> 01:07:01,124
if you agree to marry brother Jibril Issa.

612
01:07:01,124 --> 01:07:02,284
I do.

613
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:03,164
Excellent.

614
01:07:03,164 --> 01:07:06,524
The witness... the brother is present.

615
01:07:06,524 --> 01:07:11,004
The vows have nowbeen taken on one side,

616
01:07:11,004 --> 01:07:14,244
and now, for you to be tied in holy matrimony,

617
01:07:15,084 --> 01:07:18,404
we need to hear the same vows from you.

618
01:07:18,404 --> 01:07:20,324
Yes!

619
01:07:20,324 --> 01:07:21,964
Al hamdulillah. - Hamdulillah.

620
01:07:21,964 --> 01:07:25,684
I hereby declare you man and wife.

621
01:07:25,684 --> 01:07:28,284
My sincere congratulations.

622
01:07:28,284 --> 01:07:33,723
To finalise the marriage, I will pass on this ring to you.

623
01:07:33,723 --> 01:07:36,004
This is now your ring. - Thank you.

624
01:07:42,564 --> 01:07:44,244
Turn around, please.

625
01:08:30,044 --> 01:08:35,684
PLEASE LEAVE THE ROOM IN THE CONDITION IN WHICH YOU FOUND IT.

626
01:08:35,684 --> 01:08:38,404
ONLY USE BED LINEN YOU HAVE PROVIDED.

627
01:08:44,444 --> 01:08:46,284
My colleague will call you.

628
01:08:46,284 --> 01:08:48,444
You've got till 7 pm.

629
01:08:48,444 --> 01:08:50,164
How are you?

630
01:08:50,404 --> 01:08:52,444
You cooked? - Yeah.

631
01:08:57,803 --> 01:08:59,723
So, this is it. - Huh?

632
01:08:59,723 --> 01:09:01,404
This is our room.

633
01:09:04,124 --> 01:09:06,124
I'm not all that hungry.

634
01:09:06,124 --> 01:09:08,364
I'll just quickly... - Do it later.

635
01:09:09,524 --> 01:09:11,763
Let me just get everything ready.

636
01:09:44,084 --> 01:09:47,964
PLEASE WASH UP CROCKERY AND CUTLERY AT THE END OF YOUR STAY.

637
01:09:57,204 --> 01:09:58,604
Come over here.

638
01:10:18,764 --> 01:10:20,444
Hi. - Hey.

639
01:11:35,804 --> 01:11:37,444
The food.

640
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:24,324
Can I give you a hand?

641
01:12:28,084 --> 01:12:29,764
I'll lay the table.

642
01:12:34,084 --> 01:12:35,604
It's all... plastic.

643
01:13:59,404 --> 01:14:01,044
Let's go eat.

644
01:14:12,604 --> 01:14:13,604
Sorry.

645
01:14:32,484 --> 01:14:33,484
Yummy.

646
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:36,884
I'll soon be two-thirds through my sentence.

647
01:14:38,484 --> 01:14:41,484
It'd be coolto see each other more often, right?

648
01:14:45,884 --> 01:14:48,324
Did you speak to Murti about the job?

649
01:14:50,884 --> 01:14:51,884
No.

650
01:14:52,244 --> 01:14:54,364
I haven't had the time.

651
01:15:19,884 --> 01:15:20,884
Yes?

652
01:15:25,404 --> 01:15:26,404
OK.

653
01:15:32,003 --> 01:15:33,604
Time's up.

654
01:17:13,364 --> 01:17:15,044
NEW YEAR'S EVE

655
01:17:15,644 --> 01:17:17,324
A new year is about to begin...

656
01:17:17,324 --> 01:17:20,324
Why don't you take a selfie, if you know how it works?

657
01:17:20,324 --> 01:17:21,804
Don't be so cheeky.

658
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:23,564
Firstly, one of you.

659
01:17:23,564 --> 01:17:25,564
Oh yes, very nice.

660
01:17:25,844 --> 01:17:28,204
I'm gonna do loads of fireworks!

661
01:17:28,444 --> 01:17:29,604
You?

662
01:17:31,044 --> 01:17:32,764
Let's go. - It's nice...

663
01:17:32,764 --> 01:17:34,364
Move it! - Hey!

664
01:17:35,604 --> 01:17:37,124
Let's go.

665
01:17:37,124 --> 01:17:38,444
Chill.

666
01:17:38,444 --> 01:17:40,124
They're Maggi's.

667
01:17:40,684 --> 01:17:42,524
It's gonna be fun.

668
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:43,524
Hey!

669
01:17:44,684 --> 01:17:46,604
Right... - Little goof.

670
01:17:46,604 --> 01:17:49,844
Look after her, OK? - Yes! Let's go.

671
01:17:50,404 --> 01:17:52,844
I'm serious about the fireworks, OK?

672
01:17:54,844 --> 01:17:56,484
Let's go!

673
01:17:56,484 --> 01:17:58,724
Come on, let's go.

674
01:17:58,724 --> 01:18:00,604
Do your coat up, Yara.

675
01:18:00,604 --> 01:18:01,884
Yes!

676
01:18:03,364 --> 01:18:05,644
This one's for you. - Hey, I heard that!

677
01:18:06,644 --> 01:18:09,003
You can make a wish.

678
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:11,524
Love you. - You too.

679
01:18:11,524 --> 01:18:15,364
Bye, Maggi. - Bye, sweetie. See you next year.
