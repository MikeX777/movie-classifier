1
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,093
- Oh my God!

2
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,160
- First of all, our team is,

3
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,803
we call it team 81,
for this 2018 Badwater.

4
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:19,966
My crew is, first my crew
chief is Peachy Poso.

5
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,653
She has a stellar athlete.

6
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:28,570
She run more than 40
marathons and ultra marathons.

7
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,890
And she finished two
Boston marathons in a row.

8
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,673
And, she do reverse triathlons.

9
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,083
My second crew is Ibar, he
crewed for me two years ago,

10
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,360
from a Lone Pine to Whitney Portal.

11
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,283
And, he's also stellar athlete.

12
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,150
He runs lots of ultra marathons
and marathons as well.

13
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,600
And, last but not the least,

14
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,633
Steve Gerschultz.

15
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,403
He's a doctor,

16
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,980
in profession.

17
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,940
So he's also,

18
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,380
he runs like more than 50 marathons.

19
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,373
He do a lot of triathlons
and do ultras as well.

20
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,170
And, he's a doctor so he's
gonna take care of me.

21
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,790
Usually, if you run the Badwater,

22
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,880
you run like every two
miles, they do like leapfrog.

23
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,410
So, they give me all the nutrition,

24
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,440
food, water, make sure I have everything.

25
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,530
And then now,

26
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,570
the crews also one of the
crews can be a pacer too.

27
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,683
They crew from me after 42 miles,

28
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,610
and the rest to the finish.

29
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,910
What is a pacer?

30
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,780
- Actually, it's like,

31
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,130
it's not really a pacer because
you cannot run side by side.

32
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,810
They have to run behind the runner.

33
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,420
So they usually, they check on me like

34
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,603
if I'm doing good and then what I need,

35
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,313
then I have somebody to talk with.

36
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,310
Why do you like running?

37
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,883
- Oh, there's a lot of reasons.

38
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,503
One is, it's fun.

39
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,180
Number two is, for health reasons.

40
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,403
Number three is a camaraderie
among other runners.

41
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,291
And probably for is a runcation.

42
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,341
You know what I mean?

43
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,370
Like you go to other places,

44
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,060
you are sign up for a race and then you,

45
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,203
at the same time you are in vacation.

46
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,150
So why do you run the Badwater?

47
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,270
This'll be your fifth
time running Badwater.

48
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,810
- Unfortunately my fifth time,

49
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,110
because it's a love and hate relationship.

50
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,643
By the way, I mean, why do I run Badwater?

51
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,160
Because it's a difficult race

52
00:06:05,274 --> 00:06:07,353
and it's a very scenic race.

53
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:09,827
It's very nice out in Death Valley.

54
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:29,380
- You know, the good part is,

55
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,313
I'd say that's about 65 right now.

56
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
What's your resting heart rate normally?

57
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:37,240
- It should be in around 45.

58
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,240
- Oh 45, it heats up and
It's hot out here, so.

59
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,073
- Yeah.

60
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:44,120
- It's probably 60 to 65 right now.

61
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,970
It's still fit, that'll work.

62
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,200
All right, take a listen to
your lungs and your heart.

63
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,033
Make sure that,

64
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,125
deep breath there.

65
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,565
Deep breath.

66
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,033
Right here.

67
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:04,643
Right here.

68
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,440
That's great, you got good lung capacity.

69
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,273
Yeah.
- Okay.

70
00:07:09,273 --> 00:07:10,580
- That's good.

71
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,143
- Take a listen to your heart here.

72
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,240
No arrhythmias.

73
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,073
- All right.

74
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:26,906
- Yeah, yeah.

75
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:27,969
I think you're good to go here.

76
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:28,802
- Okay.

77
00:07:28,802 --> 00:07:29,635
Thank you so much.
- Go get them.

78
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:34,599
Let's go.

79
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:35,820
No, I'm just fan,

80
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,132
I drove all the way from
Texas just to come--

81
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:37,965
Did you really?

82
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:38,798
- Yeah.
- Seriously.

83
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:39,631
Wow!
- Wow!

84
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:40,464
Yeah, yeah.

85
00:07:40,464 --> 00:07:41,562
Well this sure is.

86
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,678
- If I had like my car or my bike.

87
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:45,344
- 2009,

88
00:07:49,462 --> 00:07:51,283
like I happened to hike from

89
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,048
something like 5:30

90
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:57,032
No, I lost an inch, I am 5--

91
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,487
Like actually do you hike?

92
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:26,453
I'm like the shortest, right?

93
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:50,236
One five zero.

94
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:52,590
I'm supposed to be 149.

95
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,271
Yeah but, it's the elevation.

96
00:08:57,821 --> 00:08:59,810
- Tell me reaction?

97
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,643
Yeah that's fine, that's fine.

98
00:09:00,643 --> 00:09:01,476
- All right.

99
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:02,424
Are you okay?

100
00:09:02,424 --> 00:09:03,257
- I think I'm okay.

101
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:04,669
Yeah.
- I think you'll find out.

102
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,750
- So I did--

103
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,504
- I'm just gonna throw up.

104
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:08,455
I'm gonna need it.
- No.

105
00:09:08,455 --> 00:09:09,310
That's why I have Tums,

106
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,910
I have Peptbismal

107
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,160

108
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,123

111
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,263
Yes.

112
00:09:31,263 --> 00:09:33,057
Number 34 are you here?

113
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:35,258

114
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:37,581

00:09:37,581 --> 00:09:38,440

118
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,433
- So you need your beep
lights in a minute, right?

119
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,153
- Make sure you see me,
if I can't see your face.

120
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:07,360
- I want you guys to
step back a little bit,

121
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,448
you guys step back a little
bit to be a little freer.

122
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:21,343
All right, do we have any
more runners coming down?

123
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,000
Any other runners?

124
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,944
Lets go over the roster real quick.

125
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,600
I'll make sure we're all accounted for.

126
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,341
Eight o'clock

127
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,647

Thank you.

132
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:38,740
- Watch the pole, all

Empty.
- You still got?

135
00:11:58,935 --> 00:11:59,850
It's empty, nothing.
- Empty?

136
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:00,853
You need one?

137
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,048
- I have nothing.

138
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:03,534
- Okay.
- Okay.

139
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,920
- Only the water that he don't have one?

140
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,980
Yes, he doesn't have anything.

141
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,796
Any, no nothing.

142
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:25,860
- He finished those?

143
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,860
- Yes, yeah.

144
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:36,600
- There you go.

145
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,907
Now we go driving.

146
00:12:41,663 --> 00:12:44,237
No, no, no, we're going to
drive 'cause it's way to far.

147
00:12:44,237 --> 00:12:45,465
- All right then, whoever--

148
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,970
He's too fast.

149
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,200
- Yeah, I know.

150
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,627
Come on, come on, come on, go.

151
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:02,635
I have nothing

152
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:04,440
- Rj.

153
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,290
- Cross cross cross.
- Cross, cross.

154
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:20,487
How come I cannot open this?

155
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:30,893
- Thank you
- Okay.

156
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,100
He said that they don't go too far

157
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,300
he needs lots of water.

158
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,168
Yeah, make them again.

159
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:03,560
- You know what you can do later on,

160
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,893
you can just go bring the whole tray.

161
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:10,620
You know, and then you
can just clean this one.

162
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,770
Okay.

163
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,375
That's good.

164
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:43,871
Right there.

165
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:45,180
- Gotcha.

166
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,210
I've put this one over here the 10, 12.

167
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:53,660
That's like every two hours
for his BO2 Max and salt.

168
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,950
So every time we finish it,

169
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,420
we'll just cross it so we
know if we give it or not.

170
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,640
- Okay that's fine all right.

171
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,808
Okay, now I think we can go.

172
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:02,641
- Okay.

173
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:13,802
- You wanna sit?

174
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:15,738
You want a chair?

175
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,483
- It's all ice.

176
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:19,316
- It's all ice.

177
00:15:19,316 --> 00:15:20,710
- Again?
- Yeah.

178
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,143
And then this one is no ice.

179
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,974
Why is my nose is itching?

180
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:30,610
- Your nose, it's
probably, it's because its

181
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,443
dry.
- It's dry?

182
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:34,030
'Cause it's dry?

183
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,863
Maybe?

184
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:35,781
Yeah.

185
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:37,383
- My arm, it's so sticky.

186
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:39,724
- Water?
- Water yeah.

187
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:42,330
- Yeah, I'm gonna drink water.

188
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,270
A lot.

189
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:47,333
- Yeah, you need a new one of these?

190
00:15:54,347 --> 00:15:55,600
- There's a lots of water right here.

191
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,110
- Yeah, can you put more water?

192
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,943
- More water?

193
00:15:57,943 --> 00:16:00,026
Lots of water right here.

194
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,239
- Yeah that's CarboPro.

195
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:15,320
- You've wet this.

196
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:19,370
Stick it with a.

197
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,435
Be careful not to wet your.

198
00:16:21,435 --> 00:16:22,602
Shoes.
- Shoes.

199
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:26,231
- I'm okay now.

200
00:16:26,231 --> 00:16:27,703
We're almost, like four miles.

201
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:30,050
- Where to for almost?

202
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,100
- To a Furnace Creek.

203
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:34,867
- Five more.
- No five more, five more.

204
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:35,941
Five more
- five more.

205
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:37,717
We're 12 right, yeah five more miles.

206
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:38,940
We are 12 right now.

207
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,932
- Are you okay?

208
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:40,797
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

209
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:42,805
You need some gel?

210
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:45,068
No you haven't, okay.
- I dint take any gel.

211
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:47,160
But I didn't take anything.

212
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,220
Okay you're good.
- You got gel.

213
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,053
- You're good?

214
00:16:49,053 --> 00:16:50,114
You're good.

215
00:16:50,114 --> 00:16:51,074
- All right.
- All right.

216
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:52,030
Have fun.

217
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,920
- So he wants ice on this one.

218
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,753
- Just ice he says?

219
00:16:55,753 --> 00:16:56,811
Just ice, yeah.

220
00:16:56,811 --> 00:16:58,660
- Pretty much every strenuous workout,

221
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,100
I've probably been working out

222
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,293
fairly seriously, 10, 15 years.

223
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:07,350
And each strenuous workout does give you,

224
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,020
in my personal experience,

225
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,520
a high that lasts usually about 24 hours.

226
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,180
And, basically you feel
good during that time.

227
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,520
And it's the same effect

228
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,520
that you get with drugs
and many other areas.

229
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:28,180
This has a beneficial effect because

230
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,253
it can have you continued
to want to exercise,

231
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,300
at times when you would
rather do other things.

232
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,420
- It's my therapy

233
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,400
It makes me feels calmer after a run

234
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,360
and you go see my,
like, even on my fridge,

235
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,914
it's like, running is cheaper.

236
00:17:50,914 --> 00:17:52,214
What do you call that one?

237
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,620
Cheaper therapy, something like that,

238
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,885
I forgot the word.

239
00:17:57,718 --> 00:18:02,371
But yeah, it, it makes you
more calmer after the run.

240
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:06,600
- Oh, finishing the race,
It's just tough, you know.

241
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,380
I've been running with
Gerald, most of the races.

242
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,480
Probably with three of my a hundred miler.

243
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,820
Running with him.

244
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,800
But this one is just really different.

245
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,233
You know, the heat, the humidity.

246
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,900
It's just record breaking.

247
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,230
So, and I could feel that
Gerald is worried as well,

248
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,943
but I have no doubt that he can finish it.

249
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,517
There was no time
when you were thinking,

250
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:36,680
"Oh oh, we're gonna DNF?"

251
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,793
- No, no way.

252
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,600
It's just being around
with Gerald all the time.

253
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,624
I kind of know that, you know,

254
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:50,317
it's Gerald, there's no DNA for quitting.

255
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:53,120
Just probably drag Gerald

256
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,764
to the finish line or feet crawling.

257
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:59,070
But that's how Gerald is, you know?

258
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,820
- Well, Gerald Tabios was really impressed

259
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,113
when he finished his first Badwater 135.

260
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,253
Basically,

261
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:15,110
well I can say he is the first Filipino,

262
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,577
one of the first few Filipinos so,

263
00:19:17,577 --> 00:19:19,450
who finished this.

264
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,200
And I have written an article wherein

265
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,857
I really recognize him as
the first back to back.

266
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,920
That means for two consecutive years,

267
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,049
he was able to finish the Badwater 135.

268
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,050
And I was really impressed

269
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,160
about his performance in
those two consecutive races.

270
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,350
- Gerald as a runner, he's very cool.

271
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,030
I mean, I don't know how he trains,

272
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,080
like or how we train for the Badwater,

273
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,369
because I know he has a
full time job also like me.

274
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:58,369
So me I trained after office
if I have one or two hours,

275
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:01,773
and I'll just training
the treadmill in the gym.

276
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,050
Gerald is very focused, dedicated

277
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:12,850
and he's really dedicated runner.

278
00:20:13,763 --> 00:20:15,413
He's a cool runner for me.

279
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,467
Very nice, very sweet person.

280
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:22,522
And then he's a good friend of mine also.

281
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,689
Actually we're kababayans,

282
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,160
because I also,

283
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,662
my family, some of my
relatives stay in Bukidnon.

284
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:34,079
Also Visaya.

285
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,059
So you are also Visaya?

286
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,480
- Yes, yes, I can understand a few words,

287
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,160
but I don't speak the dialect.

288
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,390
- Yes so like, inside oven,

289
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,850
you're blowing road side, to
water night, even at night.

290
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,250
How do you survive that?

291
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,620
- I heat train, I train for it.

292
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,730
The only way.

293
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,380
I always talk to a lot of people,

294
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,210
who like past champions
who are my friends,

295
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,860
and they told me just do heat training,

296
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,700
heat training, continued training.

297
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,400
Do sauna, if you can
go to the race itself,

298
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,210
train on the course or go
to Palm Springs which I did.

299
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,190
Like I frequent Palm Springs every Friday.

300
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,023
Is it dangerous?

301
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:14,856
- It is.

302
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,540
It is very special, like hot.

303
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,233
That's just killing you,
It's getting into your skin.

304
00:21:21,174 --> 00:21:22,007
And--

305
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:22,840
- I've been to the Philippines.

306
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,690
I ran the Bataan Death March.

307
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,750
It's hot and humid,

308
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,990
but this is a different heat

309
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,655
'cause it's penetrating into your skin.

310
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:36,508
All right, good job.

311
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:39,606
- I need the spray.

312
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:41,398
The dry spray?

313
00:21:41,398 --> 00:21:42,520
- Yeah, this.

314
00:21:46,353 --> 00:21:50,270
It's been a while.

315
00:21:54,127 --> 00:21:55,759
Mutual Runner.

316
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,609
- Oops oh my God.

317
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,983
It's good.

318
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:13,441
- Nice one some lube.

319
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:18,157
- Lube.

320
00:22:21,238 --> 00:22:22,637
It's like, what lube?

321
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,703
- I think I need like bandana.

322
00:22:27,703 --> 00:22:28,853
- You need banana now?

323
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:30,166
- No, the bandana.

324
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,090
- A bandana?

325
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,350
I thought you said banana.

326
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,812
I'm not gonna put much, is this better?

327
00:22:36,812 --> 00:22:38,285
- Yeah it's good.

328
00:22:38,285 --> 00:22:39,738
It's cold.

329
00:22:39,738 --> 00:22:41,723
- Yeah 'cause this is already warm.

330
00:22:41,723 --> 00:22:44,443
It's starting to get cold too.

331
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:46,192
- Are we like five miles awy?

332
00:22:46,192 --> 00:22:47,275
Yes.

333
00:22:48,554 --> 00:22:52,607
But I will stay five
miles, if five miles

334
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,436
- Give me like two minutes.

335
00:22:58,436 --> 00:22:59,269
Yeah.

336
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:00,469
- Can I have that water.

337
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,545
You want some
lube or you're good?

338
00:23:08,545 --> 00:23:10,338
- I think I'm good, you think?

339
00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:11,547
I have CarboPro right?

340
00:23:11,547 --> 00:23:12,995
Yep you do.

341
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,543
More?

342
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:24,626
- It's the ice.

343
00:23:39,874 --> 00:23:41,350
I think you got
a haircut just for this.

344
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,279
- What is that?

345
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,112
You got a haircut

346
00:23:43,112 --> 00:23:45,471
'cause it's short in the
back a little.

347
00:23:46,304 --> 00:23:47,484
You need a comb?

348
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:49,587
I think I'm good now, I'm just gonna.

349
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:50,420
Just for this I

350
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,490
- I'm gonna check my
system if it's working.

351
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,050
I feel cold when I stop.

352
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,757
- Yes of course, 'cause it's the.

353
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,740
That's why I don't want you to like,

354
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,400
wear like too much of ice.

355
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,280
Yeah, but right now you're fine.

356
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,487
- I'll see you in 15.

357
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:12,837
15.

358
00:24:12,837 --> 00:24:14,431
And he is going.

359
00:24:26,887 --> 00:24:31,887
This is uphill.

360
00:24:32,545 --> 00:24:33,969
Your going uphill here.

361
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:34,802
- Is it uphill?

362
00:24:34,802 --> 00:24:35,635
Yeah.

363
00:24:35,635 --> 00:24:37,230
- That's why my muscles are like.

364
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,520
- Yeah, you can look down and
see their cars down there.

365
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,700
- What's the elevation now?

366
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,003
It's sea level.

367
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,753
More than

368
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:47,370
Probably a couple hundred up,.

369
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:54,837
- Oh my God, I just feel like,

370
00:24:54,837 --> 00:24:56,846
I want to close my eyes.

371
00:24:56,846 --> 00:24:58,600
Take a rest.

372
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,070
- Can I get some water?

373
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,473
- You want this jug to put your thing?

374
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,240
To put your feet up.

375
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,440
- Is there like a thing
that can make me up?

376
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,769
- Caffeine.

377
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:11,103
- What is that?

378
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,545
No to make me up.

379
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:15,803
Awake you up?

380
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,710
Sun's gonna
rise in about half hour.

381
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,331
- Yeah yeah, usually when sun rises.

382
00:25:26,374 --> 00:25:27,834
Can you help him up please?

383
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:30,251
- Is there like a Redbull or?

384
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,230
Yeah, I think this is good.
- Couple of sips later,

385
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,470
yeah.
- Yeah.

386
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,475
And then I just wanna

387
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:47,591
need anew sets of water.

388
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:48,424
Oops!

389
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,352
- What happened?

390
00:25:50,352 --> 00:25:51,887
- Nothing.

391
00:25:51,887 --> 00:25:53,431
- You wet your self?

392
00:25:57,108 --> 00:25:58,770
You want this one?

393
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,771
- This is, it's not empty
yet, but you can put some ice.

394
00:26:01,771 --> 00:26:03,354
Yeah ice.

395
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:05,923
- I wanna go now.

396
00:26:05,923 --> 00:26:08,056
Okay.

397
00:26:08,056 --> 00:26:08,889
I'll see ya'.

398
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,660
I wanna get light.

399
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,020
- Good job.
- Okay.

400
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,270
One more there.

401
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,570
- One more stop and then.

402
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,050
And them we'll
be there at Stovepipe.

403
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:23,924
Stovepipe.

404
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:26,961
You want some massage?

405
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:29,711
- Oh no, look, get me some water.

406
00:26:30,712 --> 00:26:33,994
Oh my God, I just love it here.

407
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:36,397
I like it too,
it's a comfortable chair.

408
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:38,473
- Everything becomes awesome.

409
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:42,034
I love this.

410
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,217
Oh, maybe bandana, right?

411
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,360
- Have this stuff too.

412
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,847
- I fee like a king.

413
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,579
Not a princess?

414
00:27:05,663 --> 00:27:07,425
- Three of those, start there.

415
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:12,703
- I'm gonna be whining soon.

416
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:14,942
Like,

417
00:27:14,942 --> 00:27:15,775
He's like, wait,

418
00:27:15,775 --> 00:27:17,848
let me get the button and hit your head.

419
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,423
Or should I go say what June said?

420
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:26,797
- So where's that musket
sun, it's coming out right?

421
00:27:28,486 --> 00:27:29,319
You want me to take that?

422
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,902
- Less than a mile.

423
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,583
- Almost there.

424
00:27:33,643 --> 00:27:35,880
- I can see the cars, be right there.

425
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,795
- They are all lined up back there, yeah?

426
00:27:37,795 --> 00:27:38,628
- Yeah.

427
00:27:38,628 --> 00:27:39,942
- You're doing well.

428
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,695
Yeah sun comes up every half hour.

429
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:44,646
- It's all good.

430
00:27:44,646 --> 00:27:45,479
- Once the sun comes up--

431
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:48,160
I pee like every one and a half mile.

432
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,670
- Yeah, yeah, that's plenty,
yeah, you're well hydrated.

433
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:57,928
- One more stop and then the
next one is Stovepipe right?

434
00:27:57,928 --> 00:27:59,920
- Yep
- exactly.

435
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,581
Good job.

436
00:28:01,581 --> 00:28:02,581
- Thank you.

437
00:28:43,032 --> 00:28:44,367
Even though we might enough--

438
00:29:07,635 --> 00:29:09,485
And I'll just fill
them in there.

439
00:29:27,955 --> 00:29:29,849
- I think I'm gonna change.

440
00:29:31,443 --> 00:29:34,081
I'm gonna change long sleeves.

441
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:35,651
Long sleeve okay.

442
00:29:54,857 --> 00:29:56,097
Pit stop.

443
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:58,062
It's too early for the time.

444
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:04,665
- And then the blinky lights.

445
00:30:06,582 --> 00:30:08,907
- Nelson had a black
and blinky light, right?

446
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,062
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

447
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,870
- I need you to do something,

448
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,471
you want the new one with that one?

449
00:30:16,471 --> 00:30:17,420
- Yeah.

450
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,404
- So we're gonna walk.

451
00:30:19,404 --> 00:30:20,237
- Okay.

452
00:30:23,478 --> 00:30:25,473
Get it too fast.

453
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,503
Oh my God.

454
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,904
- No, no, towel first.

455
00:30:34,904 --> 00:30:37,870
- I need towel?

456
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,483
- That towel just like here.

457
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,323
- All right.

458
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,953
- Do I need hat now?

459
00:30:44,953 --> 00:30:46,080
- Well you could if you want.

460
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,820
But, it's still--

461
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,290
- Yeah, maybe the next stop, right?

462
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,123
- Yeah.

463
00:30:50,123 --> 00:30:51,160
- You want that hat?

464
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,380
- Yeah later when the sun lights up.

465
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,040
- Are you gonna wear this one again?

466
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,977
- Yeah, just dried it out.

467
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,362
- I should store it.

468
00:31:00,362 --> 00:31:01,195
- Thank you.

469
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:06,195
- What do you call it?

470
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:36,020
- Well, my friend Peachy has
a saying on her refrigerator.

471
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,940
Running is cheaper than therapy.

472
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,000
And, it's probably due to these endorphins

473
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,340
that make you feel good.

474
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:47,200
It also, physiologically just releases,

475
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,183
much of the stress that can
accumulate during the day.

476
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,387
It's recommended as most
people probably know

477
00:31:56,387 --> 00:32:00,750
20, 30 minutes of exercise at
least several times a week.

478
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,950
And that amount will
release the stress that

479
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:06,120
accumulates and be very
beneficial and helpful.

480
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,010
You'll asleep better,
you'll eat healthier foods.

481
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,360
You'll just feel better about yourself.

482
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,590
Is it better than,

483
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,920
pills prescribed by doctor?

484
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,970
- Oh, absolutely.

485
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:18,700
Not only are you getting
the neural effects,

486
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,500
you're also getting the
cardiovascular effects as well.

487
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,550
So your heart muscle is strengthening,

488
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,690
your lungs are increasing in capacity.

489
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,340
So there's many beneficial
effects to exercise.

490
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,959
You don't need to run 135
miles to get this effect,

491
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:37,833
probably a couple of hours
a week is all you need.

492
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,360
But running 135 certainly is
going to increase those effects

493
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,193
and

494
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,303
is beneficial.

495
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,623
- Oh, a lot.

496
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Without the crew, I would say maybe

497
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,145
I'm not so sure If it's possible,

498
00:32:58,145 --> 00:33:01,006
or if they allow it,

499
00:33:01,006 --> 00:33:03,390
to finish one 35 without a crew.

500
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:08,390
'Cause you have to have someone
to deal with your nutrition,

501
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,420
make sure that you have a proper nutrition

502
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,680
that you're hydrated enough.

503
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,213
And plus, you know, if you're a sleepy,

504
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:21,680
what will you do if you're
gonna just like take a cat nap

505
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,900
or you need to just like
sleep the whole hour.

506
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:29,900
So there's a lot that needs
to be done by the crew.

507
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:36,290
- So I was introduced
running like five years ago.

508
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,210
I was wearing my basketball shorts

509
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,640
and my basketball shoes running.

510
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,050
I got an injury because it's
not the proper way of running.

511
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,560
But after that, this is just like,

512
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,800
I love the sport, you know,

513
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,390
it's, you know, when you are working,

514
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,020
especially in New York,
it's very you know,

515
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,710
lots of stress in the work.

516
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:00,910
So when you're running,
it's like you are alone.

517
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:05,260
You can think of the things,
you know, work, family.

518
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,583
But just kind of distressing, you know,

519
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,520
it's you alone so,

520
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,218
that's how I love the sport running.

521
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,560
So we're giving
him some electrolytes.

522
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,197
- Yeah, we're gonna give
him some electrolytes

523
00:34:19,197 --> 00:34:21,610
and some other

524
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,240
supplements called B2O Max,

525
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,333
which is a bronchial vasodilator.

526
00:34:29,479 --> 00:34:33,530
So it helps get a little bit
more blood flow into the lungs.

527
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,530
And the electrolytes.

528
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,447
- So he's been taking that.

529
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:38,320
And the electrolytes,

530
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,830
they are essential to having
the body work correctly.

531
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,540
So we're giving mainly
potassium sodium, calcium.

532
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,240
A couple other electrolytes
that were giving

533
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,130
and that's so that the
cells function optimally.

534
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,260
When you are running in this kind of heat,

535
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,900
you're losing a lot of water
and a lot of electrolytes.

536
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,500
So both of them, you have to replace.

537
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,870
What's the danger
of losing electrolytes?

538
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,070
- If you lose too much electrolytes,

539
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,530
and then you replace it with just water,

540
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:07,350
you can get hyponatremia, which
is a dilution of the sodium.

541
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,210
And actually it can be deadly.

542
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,980
So that's one thing
you really wanna avoid.

543
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,880
That's why electrolytes

544
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,410
with this type of exertion
are very important.

545
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,610
What is the intervals

546
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,460
in the intake of electrolytes?

547
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,780
- We're going every hour.

548
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,750
So two, what we're giving is
something called endurolytes,

549
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,900
which is a supplement.

550
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,710
It's got about six different
electrolytes in it.

551
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,560
We're giving two of those every hour.

552
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,710
All throughout the race.

553
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,740
- Throughout the race yeah.

554
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,163
And then in addition,
he's hydrating of course,

555
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:45,950
it's a water and sugar mixture,
something called CarboPro,

556
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,063
which is a complex carbohydrate.

557
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,320
That's the fuel?

558
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,120
- That's a fuel, yes.

559
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,020
Equally important.

560
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,387
All right.

561
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,623
- He's gonna sit.

562
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:58,691
He's gonna sit, okay.

563
00:35:58,691 --> 00:35:59,825
- On the shady one.

564
00:36:13,727 --> 00:36:15,177
Can you finish this.

565
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:24,674
Just drink up the whole thing.

566
00:36:47,616 --> 00:36:50,783
I'll give you water hold on.

567
00:37:00,979 --> 00:37:02,229
Here, you good?

568
00:37:31,837 --> 00:37:34,840
You know, I wanna go change
this one, it looks so down.

569
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:42,160
I have the, not really good
but it's a

570
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:49,320
Hey

571
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,990
'cause we just like pass that one.

572
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,522
That's the one the 10 a.m. that I told you.

573
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:54,407
- Where is it?

574
00:37:54,407 --> 00:37:55,770
The

575
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,610
no, no, no two minutes.

576
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,727
- Oh that's 10?

577
00:37:58,727 --> 00:38:00,310
Yeah that's 10 a.m.

578
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,340
So we're good.
- Okay.

579
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,940
- And then the next cut
off time is 8:00 p.m.

580
00:38:11,008 --> 00:38:11,841
- Relax.

581
00:39:11,437 --> 00:39:13,291
Where is the other one?

582
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:14,124
That one.

583
00:39:14,124 --> 00:39:15,099
Can you get the,

584
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:16,697
just the handle.

585
00:39:17,932 --> 00:39:19,965
Please, thank you.

586
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,029
Can you transfer some of the water here?

587
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:27,943
No, no, not that one.

588
00:39:36,956 --> 00:39:38,289
Okay, thank you.

589
00:39:55,223 --> 00:39:58,056
Yeah, I'm just checking my system.

590
00:40:25,777 --> 00:40:27,549
You want more?

591
00:40:27,549 --> 00:40:29,398
- No I'm good.

592
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:34,191
What is it?

593
00:40:34,191 --> 00:40:35,725
Your vest?

594
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:36,975
- No it's okay.

595
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:39,513
My shoes melt.
- Watch your shoes,

596
00:40:39,513 --> 00:40:40,346
watch your shoes.

597
00:40:40,346 --> 00:40:42,532
- Melts, see this?

598
00:40:42,532 --> 00:40:43,527
Melt.

599
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,090
Did that melt or just wear?

600
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,273
- It melts.
- It melts.

601
00:40:48,332 --> 00:40:49,213
Tell me about it?

602
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,563
- It's a new shoes.

603
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,998
Five minutes ago

604
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,570
I would say it wears
easily cause it melts.

605
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,563
- Yeah pavement.

606
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:01,750
It's like,
- it's hot.

607
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,850
- It's hot.

608
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:03,860
All right let's go.

609
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,693
Yes let's do this.

610
00:41:04,693 --> 00:41:05,890
I'm just gonna.

611
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,513
Carry on soldier.

612
00:41:08,473 --> 00:41:10,521
- I'm just gonna pee.

613
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,050
You made it.

614
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,172
- I'm going to go down

615
00:41:55,172 --> 00:41:56,572
To Panamint Spring.

616
00:42:01,591 --> 00:42:02,685
- No, I looked right away--

617
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,703
- You need another scarf?

618
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:18,337
- Yeah, might as well.

619
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:33,900
What we gonna do,

620
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,753
you gonna take them at the downhill,

621
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:36,586
- Yeah.

622
00:42:36,586 --> 00:42:38,278
- And then you take them
though the last five--

623
00:42:40,326 --> 00:42:43,560
Fly to Panamint Spring,

624
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,122
and then Ibar is gonna
do a pill after that.

625
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:55,130
- It's still cold, but
it's gonna be hot down.

626
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:55,963
I'm okay.

627
00:42:58,433 --> 00:42:59,822
Are you okay running down?

628
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,950
- Do I need something to kick in?

629
00:43:06,698 --> 00:43:08,489
Going downhill?

630
00:43:09,322 --> 00:43:11,752
- Maybe like, I'm gonna
get a shot of that.

631
00:43:11,752 --> 00:43:12,585
CarboPro?

632
00:43:12,585 --> 00:43:16,523
- No, no the CarboPro, and
then you can add more CarboPro.

633
00:43:16,523 --> 00:43:19,425
No that's not a real

634
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:28,262
Finish that.

635
00:43:28,262 --> 00:43:29,429
- Finish this?

636
00:43:30,907 --> 00:43:32,615
- I'm just gonna go, get something.

637
00:43:32,615 --> 00:43:34,020
Real downhill
or something there.

638
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:34,853
- Yeah.

639
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:38,010
I'm good.

640
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,510
- Just need water.

641
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,840
Are you ready?

642
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,020
So the first parking spots,

643
00:43:48,595 --> 00:43:51,155
because you cannot park,

644
00:43:51,155 --> 00:43:52,480
where there isn't designated parking.

645
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,388
How many miles
is that?

646
00:43:54,388 --> 00:43:55,221
- It's like seven.
- One point.

647
00:43:55,221 --> 00:43:56,054
Seven?

648
00:43:57,713 --> 00:43:59,441
It's on the free park.

649
00:43:59,441 --> 00:44:01,132
Oh free park.

650
00:44:01,132 --> 00:44:01,965
Okay, let's go.

651
00:44:03,684 --> 00:44:04,784
- Yeah, okay let's go.

652
00:44:10,574 --> 00:44:12,410
I'm just gonna wet this
and the I'm gonna go.

653
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,615
- This is quite the race.

654
00:44:56,615 --> 00:44:58,810
The highlights probably would be

655
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:01,770
the extreme conditions
that these runners run in.

656
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:03,720
You think, I'm actually running

657
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,010
my first a hundred miler
in a couple of months.

658
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,470
And I'm excited about that,

659
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,390
but if nothing like the
conditions of this race.

660
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:13,940
This race starts in
110 degree temperature,

661
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,363
and just goes up from there.

662
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,535
Very, very difficult race,
mentally very challenging.

663
00:45:20,535 --> 00:45:23,447
These athletes are some of
the fittest in the world,

664
00:45:23,447 --> 00:45:24,700
but that's probably not enough.

665
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,080
You've got to have the mental toughness

666
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,450
to get through this 135 minutes.

667
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:33,700
- It's a team effort, not
as like an individual,

668
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,290
you know, effort.

669
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:37,320
It's always a team.

670
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,350
If someone's, if you especially,

671
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:41,053
you know, on the second night,

672
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,110
so you just need to bite your lips.

673
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,330
'Cause everyone's goal

674
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:48,130
is to bring that runner
to the finish line strong,

675
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,160
no injury and you know,
everybody's just like,

676
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,957
you know, need to have the
patience I guess is the word.

677
00:45:55,957 --> 00:45:57,260
- It's very important.

678
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:01,570
You know, when you are running
with this kind of distances,

679
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:03,193
you know, takes like 24 hours,

680
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,240
that's the backbone for your, you know,

681
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,830
and how you finish the race.

682
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:10,770
Because when you are tired,
you forget all these things.

683
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,440
You know, nutrition, you got a plan,

684
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,440
you have a spreadsheet, but
go to mile or hour number 18,

685
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:20,050
your done, like all right,
let's just keep on running.

686
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:23,385
But the crew will remind you of what

687
00:46:23,385 --> 00:46:26,090
the things you need to do.

688
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:30,320
So I think running is
like probably 30 or 40 %.

689
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,860
Crew is like 60 or 70 %.

690
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,130
So that's very important to running.

691
00:47:05,476 --> 00:47:07,226
- But it's still hot.

692
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:09,161
It'll take you 10 minutes

693
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:10,693
to do what we did in an hour.

694
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,513
- Yeah.

695
00:47:41,139 --> 00:47:42,310
Right around your joints

696
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:43,417
- Yeah the joints.

697
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:44,917
- Then the muscles.

698
00:47:48,215 --> 00:47:49,704
- I'll weigh it in,

699
00:47:49,704 --> 00:47:51,333
Panamint Springs
- Panamint Springs.

700
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:52,439
Soonest.
- That's the next one.

701
00:47:52,439 --> 00:47:54,270
- That's the next one, yeah.

702
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,490
Steve you were saying that

703
00:47:56,490 --> 00:48:00,680
Badwater is difficult
because it's on pavement?

704
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,380
- Difficult 'cause it's on pavement

705
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,400
compared to a lot of ultras,

706
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,980
which are on the dirt

707
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,870
and it really takes a
beating on the joints,

708
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:11,023
taking the knees, the hips, the back.

709
00:48:12,404 --> 00:48:13,880
It's much more difficult

710
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,383
running hard surface
compared to the dirt surface.

711
00:48:18,383 --> 00:48:19,216
On the body.

712
00:48:19,216 --> 00:48:24,216
- Is there like, something like
nutrition, to keep me going.

713
00:49:43,569 --> 00:49:46,152
- We are taking a burger I see.

714
00:50:19,552 --> 00:50:21,751
- Like bucket with ice.

715
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:23,651
- What are you saying, hurting?

716
00:50:23,651 --> 00:50:26,317
- Just like put them in ice, all right?

717
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,693
We're gonna recycle this.

718
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,563
This are, environmental friendly.

719
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:46,603
Recycle the socks.

720
00:50:53,447 --> 00:50:56,182
Thank you Peachy, you can pit it down now.

721
00:50:56,182 --> 00:50:57,932
No, no, no.

722
00:51:16,495 --> 00:51:18,841
- No, no, I'm gonna go
keep this one for later on.

723
00:51:18,841 --> 00:51:19,674
- Yeah.

724
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:24,726
- Right, only one mile.

725
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:45,030
- Gerald is going on, Gerald
is Gerald doing five Badwaters

726
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:50,030
it's not, no offense meant
to people that does 5k.

727
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:51,820
I do a lot of short races,

728
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:56,820
but I don't think it's
even on the physical side,

729
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:00,430
I've seen that, I've read about it.

730
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:01,590
Not just Badwater.

731
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:05,566
I read about, you know, I
read about ultra runners.

732
00:52:05,566 --> 00:52:08,980
For me it's 95 % mental.

733
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:12,944
So he's very unique 'cause
it's not the physical part,

734
00:52:12,944 --> 00:52:17,290
he's very mentally strong.

735
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:19,593
So that's when if he
thinks he's gonna finish,

736
00:52:19,593 --> 00:52:21,060
he's gonna finish.

737
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,890
So the body just follows.

738
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,300
We've seen that in some of the,

739
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,751
you know videos of,

740
00:52:27,751 --> 00:52:30,344
ultra runners doing, you know,

741
00:52:30,344 --> 00:52:34,001
100 day runs, you know,
through the deserts of,

742
00:52:34,001 --> 00:52:38,480
you know, running through
what eight countries I think.

743
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,880
Even if they were hurt, they recover.

744
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,670
But they never stopped
running every day, you know?

745
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:44,380
So it's basically mind over matter.

746
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:47,200
You know, so once you think
that you're gonna finish,

747
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,782
and that's very rare,

748
00:52:48,782 --> 00:52:50,670
most of the time before
you can even start,

749
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,170
you're really doubting yourself

750
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,863
and obviously to do five Badwater.

751
00:52:54,863 --> 00:52:57,210
There's no doubt in this guy.

752
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,180
That's why he always finishes you know?

753
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:02,460
Because he is very strong mentally.

754
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,887
I think that's key

755
00:53:03,887 --> 00:53:06,540
to being an ultra runner.

756
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,480
So you know that,

757
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,370
your pain threshold is
very high, you know?

758
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:13,450
Because there's so much pain,

759
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:16,150
but if your mind is
stronger than the pain,

760
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:17,727
then you don't feel that,

761
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,440
you don't worry about it too.

762
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,730
A lot of people do, you know,

763
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:23,370
so that's why before they can even start

764
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:26,160
there basically you
might as well not start.

765
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,107
'Cause see if you're doubting yourself,

766
00:53:28,107 --> 00:53:30,163
then don't, all right?

767
00:53:30,163 --> 00:53:31,750
'Cause that's 135 miles, you know?

768
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,580
So I've done it by diving.

769
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,630
And it was a struggle with this drive,

770
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,650
first time I went there for not the crew,

771
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,030
but the watch the team,

772
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,360
I had my dog with me,

773
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,652
me and my dog had to
struggle just to kinda,

774
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,020
keep up with the race, you know?

775
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,520
So just imagine you're actually
doing it for 135 miles.

776
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,200
And again, average heat in Badwater

777
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,700
it's like at least more 110.

778
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,310
So that's very rare.

779
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:58,400
So I'm very proud of Gerald here that,

780
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,600
you know, it's like all very
inspiring what he's doing.

781
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,430
And I love that because, you know,

782
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:08,000
that's always, what I
want is to be involved

783
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,690
with something that would inspire people.

784
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:13,521
And that's what he has done, you know.

785
00:54:13,521 --> 00:54:17,403
So thank you, thank you
for inspiring you know.

786
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:28,683
So what did you say?

787
00:54:28,683 --> 00:54:31,380
- Have you seen those
cars they are going back?

788
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,280
With those crew.

789
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,325
May be they
are going back where--

790
00:54:35,325 --> 00:54:36,497
They might be done.

791
00:54:36,497 --> 00:54:37,425
Yeah, they might be done.

792
00:54:37,425 --> 00:54:38,675
Yeah.

793
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,450
'Cause I know that number
one, probably somebody--

794
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:42,283
It's okay.

795
00:54:42,283 --> 00:54:44,420
- It's like so, I'm ready to
get that temperature reading.

796
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,253
- Okay try, try--

797
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,363
133.

798
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:56,590
- It's hot.

799
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:57,423
133.

800
00:54:57,423 --> 00:54:58,862
- I think it's a good idea that we walk.

801
00:55:00,223 --> 00:55:02,124
- I think the electrolytes were--

802
00:55:04,904 --> 00:55:05,737
- That one.

803
00:55:10,303 --> 00:55:12,520
- Oh my God, my feet are burning.

804
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,353
- Wait, wat, wait.

805
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:14,430
Remove your glasses.

806
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:30,152
Gerald why do
you run the Badwater 135.

807
00:55:30,152 --> 00:55:30,986
- What are you saying?

808
00:55:30,986 --> 00:55:32,643
Why do you run the Badwater 135.

809
00:55:32,643 --> 00:55:35,080
- I don't even know what the answer.

810
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,240
He loves me.

811
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:40,456
- I don't even know
what the answer for now.

812
00:55:40,456 --> 00:55:42,404
'Cause I'm crazy.

813
00:55:42,404 --> 00:55:43,390
Wait, wait, wait.

814
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:45,970
At this temperature, I don't know why.

815
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:47,602
- What a minute Gerald

816
00:55:47,602 --> 00:55:48,781
didn't you just ask me a while ago?

817
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:50,883
- Yeah

818
00:55:51,997 --> 00:55:53,312
This is crazy.
- Ibar, why did you join

819
00:55:53,312 --> 00:55:54,520
the 135 race?

820
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,407
- It's heaven.

821
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,718
- I think I know what heaven means.

822
00:56:02,718 --> 00:56:05,223
- I think we are a bunch
idiots, that's why.

823
00:56:10,855 --> 00:56:11,688
- A little crazy.

824
00:56:11,688 --> 00:56:13,616
- We're not even half way yet.

825
00:56:20,364 --> 00:56:22,509
- Okay the half way, I think it's 72.

826
00:56:23,992 --> 00:56:25,910
- Okay 70 is 140, okay.

827
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:27,020
137

828
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:29,920
Just over halfway.

829
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,463
- Okay, it's nice to know.

830
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,972
- All right, you gonna take this.

831
00:56:40,972 --> 00:56:41,805
All right let's go.

832
00:56:45,506 --> 00:56:47,233
- It's like, it's 200 degrees.

833
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:55,673
- Do you have enough?

834
00:57:17,897 --> 00:57:20,400
- Again, I've been doing
this for a long time.

835
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,820
And my dream is to

836
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,920
see that Philippine flag
being waved at Badwater.

837
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,010
And I know a lot of guys
that were doing the race

838
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:33,140
and some of them I sponsored too,

839
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,500
but they were not Filipinos, right?

840
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,440
So, my dream was to see a flag.

841
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,360
The Philippines flag.

842
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,569
One day I said there
should be a Philippine flag

843
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:41,463
in the Badwater race

844
00:57:41,463 --> 00:57:43,360
or at the Badwater race.

845
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:47,452
And I only knew four ultra
runners back in the days.

846
00:57:47,452 --> 00:57:49,479
It was just Ben,

847
00:57:49,479 --> 00:57:51,312
it was Carmela Laison.

848
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,026
The guy from San Francisco,

849
00:57:57,026 --> 00:58:00,913
Rick Gaston and other girl Tess Gedes.

850
00:58:00,913 --> 00:58:04,773
Tess Gedes owns that Rim
to Rim in the ultra race in

851
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,860
Arizona Grant to grant.

852
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,650
And she also owns that race in Hawaii,

853
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:13,010
which is the volcano, to
volcano I think, right?

854
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,790
So we only had four Filipino ultra runners

855
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:16,623
back in the day,

856
00:58:16,623 --> 00:58:18,070
when we were seven or eight years ago.

857
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,537
So my challenge was,

858
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,837
"Hey, if anyone wants to do it,

859
00:58:21,837 --> 00:58:23,160
"I'll take care of everything."

860
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,910
I'll pay for the entry fee

861
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,840
I'll provide the vehicle.

862
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,650
Everything they need 'cause we're ahead

863
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:31,063
hey, own a running store
so everything they needed

864
00:58:31,063 --> 00:58:32,317
we can get right?

865
00:58:32,317 --> 00:58:34,146
We can get sponsorship.

866
00:58:34,146 --> 00:58:35,910
So that was a standing order.

867
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:38,597
Everybody one by one,
I remember Rick Gaston,

868
00:58:38,597 --> 00:58:40,856
"I only do ultra, I
only do trail running."

869
00:58:43,296 --> 00:58:44,613
And Tess Gedes too so,

870
00:58:44,613 --> 00:58:47,530
I think it was boiling down

871
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:50,650
to just you and supposed
to be Carmella, right?

872
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:53,049
But for some reason, Carmella,
I think stopped, you know.

873
00:58:53,049 --> 00:58:56,367
So Ben was like the best fit and Ben was,

874
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:57,837
"Oh man, I'm not gonna do it.

875
00:58:57,837 --> 00:58:58,897
"I don't lie to do that,

876
00:58:58,897 --> 00:59:00,297
"It's on the road as well,

877
00:59:00,297 --> 00:59:01,953
"I don't want to do the road."

878
00:59:01,953 --> 00:59:03,353
But eventually, you know,

879
00:59:03,353 --> 00:59:05,500
the calling was there, you know,

880
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:10,310
and to be the first one
was, you know, scary.

881
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:11,190
But at the same time,

882
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:15,641
if the community like us we're
there to provide support,

883
00:59:15,641 --> 00:59:18,430
then it could become a reality, right?

884
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,390
So I think that's something that

885
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,420
we're really so proud of being part of.

886
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:24,519
Not like going,

887
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:25,830
"Oh Ben will make it happen."

888
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:27,220
You know, like whatever you need,

889
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:30,265
we'll hey, I wanna share that.

890
00:59:30,265 --> 00:59:32,972
'Cause we were in a very rare,

891
00:59:32,972 --> 00:59:35,690
you know position because we're

892
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:37,115
in the running industry, you know?

893
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:39,590
And that's what I did
too in the Philippines,

894
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:43,010
we brought, not that there
were no running there,

895
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:45,253
but we tried to cultivate
running in the Philippines too.

896
00:59:45,253 --> 00:59:46,700
Like a few years back

897
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,700
when we opened our stores
there you know so, very rare.

898
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,290
That was a funny story
back in the days now,

899
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:54,995
I was, and there's four.

900
00:59:54,995 --> 00:59:58,650
I think I posted it on
them and then I challenged

901
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,968
the four of them who
wants to get.

902
01:00:02,748 --> 01:00:03,581
It took him like two years.

903
01:00:03,581 --> 01:00:05,933
I think he said, you know
what, I'm gonna do it.

904
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:07,360
It took two years, you know,

905
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:11,122
for somebody to really,
you know what let's do it.

906
01:00:11,122 --> 01:00:14,970
And the rest is history, right, so.

907
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:16,703
- I run like the first six miles.

908
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:19,030
It was so hot.

909
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:21,180
After six miles, I stopped running,

910
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,210
even though it's a descent,

911
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:23,810
but they stopped running.

912
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:27,730
I walk, I decided, and then
that was so smart for me.

913
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:30,430
My pacer was Steve, and
then he told me that,

914
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:31,400
that is so smart.

915
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,333
You walk because it's too hot.

916
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,773
So it's a strategy.

917
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,250
So I don't wanna be overheated.

918
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:41,432
And you know that there's,

919
01:00:41,432 --> 01:00:44,523
after the descent in Panamint Spring,

920
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:48,933
it's like you crossed that sand dunes.

921
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:50,973
That was so hot,

922
01:00:50,973 --> 01:00:55,973
that was the hottest place that
I've ever felt in that race.

923
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,000
It feels like 135 for me.

924
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,550
I was even touching my shoes
and then my shoes got melt

925
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:04,383
in that

926
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,690
like mile

927
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:09,440
I wanna say like mile 68

928
01:01:10,453 --> 01:01:12,391
it started to melt.

929
01:01:12,391 --> 01:01:15,507
The rubber started ripping out.

930
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,482
And I was like,

931
01:01:18,482 --> 01:01:20,773
I mean it's like a month old shoes.

932
01:01:22,048 --> 01:01:23,425
It was crazy.

933
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:28,240
So how far are we in the course?

934
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,620
- This will be mile 80, when we get here.

935
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:32,510
Mile 80.

936
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:35,830
- Mile 80, yes so we are making progress.

937
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:38,680
So we're
almost to the 100 mile mark?

938
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,530
Almost to
the 100 mile mark yeah.

939
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:45,088
The next check off will be at 91, mile 91.

940
01:01:45,088 --> 01:01:48,290
How's our runner going?

941
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:49,769
I think he's doing very well.

942
01:01:49,769 --> 01:01:54,180
He's tenacious, he just does not give up.

943
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:56,570
That was really hot a couple of hours ago

944
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:58,380
as we saw and experienced.

945
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,130
And for him to make it through that,

946
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:02,100
that's pretty impressive,
he just kept going.

947
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,370
He's picking up speed?

948
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:04,530
- And he's picking up speed.

949
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,040
I think he's gaining confidence.

950
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,340
I can see that in him.

951
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:10,410
He's kind of bypassing
the van if you noticed.

952
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:13,730
And I think he's gonna finish strong.

953
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,950
How many people
have a DNF already?

954
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:18,470
- Well, when I looked at
the last check-in station,

955
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:21,751
there were somewhere between
12 and 15 that DNFed.

956
01:02:21,751 --> 01:02:22,584
Wow.

957
01:02:22,584 --> 01:02:23,417
- Including some.

958
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:24,250
Is this yours?

959
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:25,638
- It's not, no, no sorry.

960
01:02:25,638 --> 01:02:26,471
Including
- I just don't

961
01:02:26,471 --> 01:02:27,304
need to be conned.

962
01:02:27,304 --> 01:02:28,410
Yeah.

963
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:31,981
Including some very elite runners.

964
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,284
Yeah, well.

965
01:02:33,284 --> 01:02:34,160
- So yeah.

966
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,290
We're going strong.

967
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:37,513
- Going strong, hopefully keep it going.

968
01:02:38,937 --> 01:02:41,470
- When I was in the Philippines,

969
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:45,350
I was like dreaming of
running some day in the US

970
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:46,970
like I was reading like,

971
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,527
I used to buy those magazines,

972
01:02:48,527 --> 01:02:50,330
"The Runner's World"
magazines in the Philippines.

973
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:54,342
Like I go to like a PX Goods store

974
01:02:54,342 --> 01:02:57,320
and then buy this old
'Runner's World" magazines.

975
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,357
And then I like,

976
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,367
"Oh, this is so cool,

977
01:02:59,367 --> 01:03:03,560
"I'm gonna go there, I'm gonna
run the New York marathon."

978
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,660
I was like reading this Oprah wearing,

979
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:09,350
I mean, running the New York marathon.

980
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:11,900
So someday I'm gonna go
there, I'm gonna run.

981
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:15,250
Now, you have to be a runner.

982
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:18,510
You have to run fast to
be a competitive runner.

983
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:20,073
So I don't have time to train.

984
01:03:23,478 --> 01:03:24,978
I work like a dog.

985
01:03:26,038 --> 01:03:27,871
I work 10 hours a day.

986
01:03:28,964 --> 01:03:30,605
So I didn't have time for training.

987
01:03:30,605 --> 01:03:31,967
It's hard to juggle up like,

988
01:03:31,967 --> 01:03:36,640
juggle family, training and running.

989
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:40,677
I mean training, running and your family.

990
01:04:04,518 --> 01:04:07,717
Finally,.

991
01:04:12,827 --> 01:04:13,660
- Tough.

992
01:04:18,949 --> 01:04:20,027
- Yeah.

993
01:04:20,027 --> 01:04:20,860
- All right good.

994
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:23,027
- Everything is Christine.

995
01:04:24,274 --> 01:04:26,860
- That's really hot, you survived 135.

996
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,850
It's very, no, no, no, no.

997
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:30,490
I'm talking about the hat.

998
01:04:31,663 --> 01:04:33,360
- I know.

999
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,997
- It's kinda like relevant to the race.

1000
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,489
- 135 degrees.

1001
01:04:37,489 --> 01:04:38,356
- 135 degrees.

1002
01:04:38,356 --> 01:04:40,070
- Oh, the temperature,

1003
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:40,930
that was so hot.

1004
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:43,852
Badwater 135, 135 degrees.

1005
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,533
- See it now.

1006
01:04:50,533 --> 01:04:52,613
- I know, I haven't
looked at my shoes yet.

1007
01:04:52,613 --> 01:04:53,446
- Yeah you've not.

1008
01:04:53,446 --> 01:04:54,279
- Yeah.

1009
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,593
Not much, not as yours.

1010
01:05:03,697 --> 01:05:06,305
I can only run I know 126.

1011
01:05:07,863 --> 01:05:09,683
And I'm dead.

1012
01:05:09,683 --> 01:05:10,733
- That was hard,

1013
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:13,363
to survive.

1014
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:17,700
- My, allusions like kick in.

1015
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:19,457
- Do we still have ice?

1016
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,290
- Yes.

1017
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:22,093
- We're gonna buy in a Lone Pine, right?

1018
01:05:22,982 --> 01:05:24,410
You think, you still have those bags?

1019
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:26,300
- Yeah, I still have like three under,

1020
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,760
or four untouched yeah.
- Untouched?

1021
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,100
- It's not melt?

1022
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:31,280
- No, 'Cause I bought,

1023
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,113
there's like two in there

1024
01:05:32,113 --> 01:05:34,843
and then I bought another five.

1025
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:36,890
So I guess we're good.

1026
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:38,283
- What time is it?

1027
01:05:38,283 --> 01:05:39,253
- 7:01.

1028
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:41,663
- Steve.

1029
01:05:41,663 --> 01:05:42,803
- No, he's already ready for it.

1030
01:05:42,803 --> 01:05:43,636
- 7:10,

1031
01:05:44,883 --> 01:05:45,716
7:10.

1032
01:05:45,716 --> 01:05:47,286
- Oh, okay.

1033
01:05:47,286 --> 01:05:49,097
- We gonna leave at 7:10.

1034
01:05:49,097 --> 01:05:50,214
What's 7:10.

1035
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:51,457
- Rest
- like it's 7:01.

1036
01:05:51,457 --> 01:05:52,290
7:01?

1037
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:53,123
- Like nine, yeah.

1038
01:05:53,123 --> 01:05:54,360
It's 10 minutes.
- Oh it's 7:10, got it.

1039
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,910
- Do you want me to put you bandana?

1040
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:57,743
Got it.

1041
01:05:57,743 --> 01:05:58,576
What is it?

1042
01:05:58,576 --> 01:05:59,409
- A bandana.

1043
01:05:59,409 --> 01:06:00,845
Oh, I don't need.

1044
01:06:00,845 --> 01:06:01,678
- You don't a bandana?

1045
01:06:01,678 --> 01:06:02,644
Okay.
- No.

1046
01:06:31,648 --> 01:06:33,060
- What is of importance,

1047
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:37,860
well, for me, I've always
been in the running industry.

1048
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,200
So especially as a Filipino,

1049
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,220
that was kind of rare in the past.

1050
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:45,910
So about 20 years, slowly I've met Ben.

1051
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:47,870
Some guys as well.

1052
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:49,499
There was only a few before,

1053
01:06:49,499 --> 01:06:52,204
And now there's like,

1054
01:06:55,997 --> 01:06:57,382
You have done what four now?

1055
01:06:57,382 --> 01:06:58,215
- Five.

1056
01:06:58,215 --> 01:06:59,360
- Five, so that's amazing.

1057
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,050
So when we ID and they own that there,

1058
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:04,380
when we were doing the blogs,

1059
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,050
our blogs with BR and AR

1060
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:08,352
and you know, that'd be,

1061
01:07:08,352 --> 01:07:09,680
I mean eventually we can produce someone

1062
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:13,400
from the Philippines to
come and do our Filipino,

1063
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,091
to do a Badwater and now,

1064
01:07:17,016 --> 01:07:19,813
So I think it's very important
cause it's inspiring.

1065
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,700
We're all promoting
health and fitness plus,

1066
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:28,570
the idea of there's no limit, you know,

1067
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:31,205
right?

1068
01:07:31,205 --> 01:07:35,730
Now you can do 135
miles in 127 degree heat

1069
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:37,620
and it's doable

1070
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,250
and it's not just doable
by people we don't know,

1071
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:41,850
but people we know.

1072
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:45,781
So it makes the dream
a reality that there,

1073
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:49,665
special athletes run.

1074
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:52,300
They are very special but

1075
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,470
knowing that they're also Filipinos,

1076
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:56,090
it makes it very realistic.

1077
01:07:56,090 --> 01:08:00,980
So do this, we're
actually empowering everyone.

1078
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,670
Hey, just follow your dream, you know?

1079
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:06,482
So eventually it's gonna happen with us.

1080
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:08,860
There's a little edge,
that we take like see

1081
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:10,700
we're in this environment of running,

1082
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:14,150
most accepted, most accessible

1083
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:15,400
But are now we're seeing

1084
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,420
actual Filipinos training in
the Philippines doing Badwater.

1085
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:22,490
So that's for me the value
of inspiration by this guys,

1086
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:25,340
you know, they inspired them to,

1087
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,800
if they can do it, those
guys can do it as well.

1088
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,420
I think I'm just happy now

1089
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:31,540
I'm part of that because I'm
in that industry, you know?

1090
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,145
So I think that's what I can add on,

1091
01:08:34,145 --> 01:08:37,483
Very important 'cause
we're inspired people.

1092
01:08:40,947 --> 01:08:41,780
And that's you know,

1093
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:45,213
ultimate as a whole is to
inspire others, you know?

1094
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:48,794
Especially reaching out

1095
01:09:21,478 --> 01:09:22,368
- What?

1096
01:09:22,368 --> 01:09:23,858
- They gonna be waiting for us.

1097
01:09:23,858 --> 01:09:25,101
- Yeah.

1098
01:09:25,101 --> 01:09:26,893
I think two miles.

1099
01:09:55,497 --> 01:09:57,971
- That's a classic
location right in there.

1100
01:09:57,971 --> 01:09:58,833
Yeah.

1101
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:22,137
- It's red, it's not full
blister but it's red there.

1102
01:10:22,137 --> 01:10:23,171
- What is this?

1103
01:10:27,714 --> 01:10:31,755
- It's okay?
- My legs.

1104
01:10:55,811 --> 01:10:56,644
- You're a king man.

1105
01:10:56,644 --> 01:10:58,240
I don't wanna be a princess.

1106
01:11:00,306 --> 01:11:01,556
- At what mile?

1107
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:04,063
90.

1108
01:11:04,063 --> 01:11:05,033
- Mile 90?

1109
01:11:05,033 --> 01:11:05,940
Yeah.

1110
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:07,849
- No princess at mile 90?

1111
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:19,470
That's like the new shoes right?

1112
01:11:20,391 --> 01:11:21,224
- No.

1113
01:11:22,203 --> 01:11:24,803
This is just like two mile.

1114
01:11:24,803 --> 01:11:27,103
Peachy are you
getting ready to run?

1115
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:29,543
Oh yeah, but the runner is not.

1116
01:11:34,692 --> 01:11:36,880
I'm but he's not.

1117
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,256
Let him rest though.

1118
01:11:52,757 --> 01:11:56,370
So from here
what's our next stop.

1119
01:11:56,370 --> 01:12:01,370
- Six mile, well we're
gonna do six mile exchanges.

1120
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:06,473
So Peachy is gonna run six miles.

1121
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:09,070
Run not.

1122
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:11,470
Well, it's up to Gerald.

1123
01:12:11,470 --> 01:12:13,373
It's downhill so he might run a bit.

1124
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:19,410
And then Ibar's gonna run
six and then I'll do six.

1125
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:22,030
And then we're gonna go four, four, four,

1126
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:23,840
and then we're hopefully
gonna be as Lone Pine

1127
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:24,673
at that point.

1128
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:26,730
And that'll be about daybreak,

1129
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:29,650
probably around six o'clock, 6:00 p.m.

1130
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:31,290
or a.m. excuse me.

1131
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:32,870
And then it would probably take us about

1132
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:36,253
four or five hours going up the 13 miles.

1133
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,023
So that should be good time.

1134
01:12:40,674 --> 01:12:43,171
So my guess
is in 11 or 12 o'clock,

1135
01:12:43,171 --> 01:12:44,363
then we shall see.

1136
01:12:46,819 --> 01:12:49,119
And that would
be like, mid-sub 40s.

1137
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:53,130
Yeah that'd be sub 40,

1138
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:54,430
yeah which would be great.

1139
01:12:58,817 --> 01:13:01,850
Is Gerald picking
up good speed, good time?

1140
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:03,780
He's consistent right now.

1141
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:05,170
I don't know if we're picking up time,

1142
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:06,493
but he's been consistent.

1143
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:08,650
He just keeps going.

1144
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,270
He may be can pick up a little
bit of time on this downhill.

1145
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:14,600
It's down downhill yeah.

1146
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,660
Especially if he were to run but.

1147
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:18,740
It's a catch 22, If you run,

1148
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:21,473
you get more tired and
then you need to rest more.

1149
01:13:21,473 --> 01:13:22,670
Otherwise blisters.

1150
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:24,230
It's catch 22.

1151
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:25,063
They'll be okay.

1152
01:13:25,063 --> 01:13:26,660
They're gonna be a little
painful but at this point

1153
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:27,843
he just guts it out.

1154
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:33,640
No major injuries?

1155
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:36,833
- No, he's just very fit.

1156
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:39,433
Put together well.

1157
01:13:45,511 --> 01:13:47,630
Where are we at now Steve?

1158
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:52,630
- We are six miles from the
intersection of the 395.

1159
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,980
And how far
is that in to our race?

1160
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,200
- In the race 13,

1161
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,910
19 miles left.

1162
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:03,846
Wow, we crossed the 100 mile?

1163
01:14:03,846 --> 01:14:06,655
- Yeah, crossed a 100
while you were snoozing.

1164
01:14:06,655 --> 01:14:08,170
How's Gerald?

1165
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:10,640
- We didn't videotape you snoozing,

1166
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,663
snoring though, but we could have.

1167
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,390
I don't get into the desert.

1168
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,030
How's Gerald doing?

1169
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:20,080
- He's doing well, he's tired.

1170
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,480
He's taken naps kind of.

1171
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,840
He's marching forward?

1172
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:25,421
- Every two hours, he's
marching forward, yeah.

1173
01:14:25,421 --> 01:14:26,254
All right.

1174
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:27,770
- He's got a big climb coming up though.

1175
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:28,650
That'll be interesting.

1176
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:30,460
13 Miles left?

1177
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:31,600
- 19 miles left.

1178
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,920
19 miles left and do only.

1179
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,850
- About six miles flat downhill

1180
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:38,355
and then 13 miles up.

1181
01:14:38,355 --> 01:14:40,750
And it's only barely

1182
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,050
six o'clock.
- Six o'clock, yep.

1183
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:42,883
Yeah.

1184
01:14:42,883 --> 01:14:45,190
- So he's got a chance to finish under

1185
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:46,931
40 hours.
- To beat his time.

1186
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:48,914
- Well, we'll see.

1187
01:14:48,914 --> 01:14:52,653
My guess is still around 11
or 12 he's gonna finish so.

1188
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:54,805
All right.

1189
01:14:54,805 --> 01:14:56,233
- We'll see how it goes.

1190
01:14:58,220 --> 01:14:59,053
The runner's high.

1191
01:14:59,053 --> 01:15:00,630
The runner's high is due to endorphins

1192
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:02,760
that are produced with exercise.

1193
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,270
And usually it's fairly extreme exercise.

1194
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:08,310
You need to produce those endorphins.

1195
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:11,420
And it's the same effect that
you get if you eat chocolate,

1196
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:13,000
you fall in love,

1197
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,270
You take narcotics,

1198
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:16,580
all the same stuff.

1199
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,620
It's a neurotransmitter that's in

1200
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:23,449
the brain and it increases
during strenuous exercise,

1201
01:15:23,449 --> 01:15:26,310
during such things as ultras.

1202
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:29,812
It's probably going off
the charts as far as,

1203
01:15:29,812 --> 01:15:33,620
the production of the endorphins.

1204
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:34,860
- Oh, it's a weather.

1205
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,630
This is the first time I felt that

1206
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:39,750
the sunglasses melt on my face.

1207
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:44,183
And that I really need to focus on Gerald,

1208
01:15:44,183 --> 01:15:47,549
to make sure that, you know,

1209
01:15:47,549 --> 01:15:50,640
hydration wise that he's,

1210
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:55,210
hydrated enough to go to the 135,

1211
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:57,130
specialty that's long stretch.

1212
01:15:57,130 --> 01:16:01,600
And we kinda changed
the strategy this year,

1213
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,322
compared from last year so,

1214
01:16:03,322 --> 01:16:07,418
and being a chief crew is hard,

1215
01:16:07,418 --> 01:16:11,300
'cause you have to think
not just for the runner,

1216
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,760
but for the whole team.

1217
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,176
- The elements out there,

1218
01:16:16,176 --> 01:16:20,390
temperature wise it's
just record-breaking.

1219
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:25,390
Now you can get run 135
degrees Fahrenheit temperature

1220
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:29,287
but you know, Gerald's determination,

1221
01:16:29,287 --> 01:16:34,287
yeah, he's making it look really easy.

1222
01:16:34,336 --> 01:16:38,270
And that's the mental toughness

1223
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:39,827
that I've seen in Gerald so.

1224
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:42,750
- Oh Badwater

1225
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:46,823
you're not disappointed with what

1226
01:16:46,823 --> 01:16:50,910
is being tagged as the
word toughest footrace.

1227
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:54,260
So I have proven that, that's true

1228
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:57,300
since I've ran for

1229
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:02,060
about 50 kilometers from Stovepipe Wells

1230
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:05,160
up to Panamint Springs.

1231
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,110
So it's really true.

1232
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:09,340
You have the elevation, the heat,

1233
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:12,253
the distance and the wind.

1234
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:15,563
- What can I say?

1235
01:17:15,563 --> 01:17:17,860
It's the hottest place on earth?

1236
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:22,200
My God, it's very challenging.

1237
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:27,200
Yeah, but it's beautifully dangerous.

1238
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:30,830
I like the solitude,

1239
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:33,680
but it's

1240
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,690
the route.

1241
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:38,950
It's majestic, but it's very dangerous.

1242
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:40,910
But I love Badwater.

1243
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:44,490
I fell in love with it
when I joined it in 2016.

1244
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:49,490
So I told myself I'm gonna
come back for you know,

1245
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,748
for another try.

1246
01:17:51,748 --> 01:17:54,260
- It's like you're in an oven.

1247
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:57,423
You open the open and it
just blows into your face.

1248
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,263
Like continuously.

1249
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,730
I completed the race in 44 hours.

1250
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:07,720
But a lot of it was tough,

1251
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:10,383
like I, you can eat a lot,

1252
01:18:11,301 --> 01:18:14,470
you have to manage the, like
you have really heat train.

1253
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:17,560
Like when I was at mile 42,

1254
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,140
I think I over ate knowing that,

1255
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:23,630
okay, I have'nt since the
start up the race 5:00 p.m.,

1256
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:25,060
I hadn't had breakfast or lunch.

1257
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:26,450
So that was my big meal, right?

1258
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:30,550
And I was the tackle 17
miles of climbing so,

1259
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:32,030
I over ate,

1260
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:33,900
and during the climb was hot.

1261
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,600
My body couldn't process it.

1262
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,260
I was surprised like after
one mile or two miles

1263
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:42,910
how come there's nothing,
I was about to throw up.

1264
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:44,310
And after I cleared it up,

1265
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:46,773
then I had been resurgent again.

1266
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:51,320
- Badwater 135 isn't ultra marathon,

1267
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:54,110
it's a 135 miles.

1268
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:56,320
It starts from Badwater Basin,

1269
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:59,240
which is 282 feet below sea level.

1270
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,940
And then it crosses Death Valley.

1271
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:05,560
And then it ends in Mount Whitney Portal,

1272
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:08,190
which is 8,360 feet.

1273
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:11,840
Mount Whitney Portal is a
trailhead of Mount Whitney,

1274
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,330
which is the highest mountain in the

1275
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:17,463
contiguous United States.

1276
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:23,530
The race is always held in July,

1277
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:28,283
which is the temperature is
basically 120 to 130 degrees.

1278
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:31,930
Is it?
- I'll be right in there.

1279
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:33,480
- Yeah maybe take it off right?

1280
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:35,833
- Is it?

1281
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:37,110
- Yeah, it's.

1282
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:38,210
- It's not bad, right?

1283
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:40,990
- It's not super bad, but it's red.

1284
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:42,509
- And then this too.

1285
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:47,002
- You gonna throw this.

1286
01:19:47,002 --> 01:19:48,489
This is disposable socks Ibar.

1287
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:50,269
- Like this one?

1288
01:19:50,269 --> 01:19:52,820
- The one, no no,

1289
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,566
There's a white one that.

1290
01:19:57,345 --> 01:19:58,178
Was that the one?

1291
01:19:58,178 --> 01:19:59,650
- It's gonna be the same spot probably.

1292
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:00,506
- Same spot, right?

1293
01:20:00,506 --> 01:20:01,629
It's getting worse.

1294
01:20:01,629 --> 01:20:04,653
- Yeah, it's red, it's
not really a blister yet.

1295
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:06,843
- Oh so.

1296
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,412
- I'll just draw the outline of it--

1297
01:20:09,412 --> 01:20:10,298
- Yeah, yeah.

1298
01:20:10,298 --> 01:20:11,473
- It's like an area just about like that.

1299
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,524
It's probably gonna get a blister.

1300
01:20:13,524 --> 01:20:15,270
- Yeah, we'll just have to fix it.

1301
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:16,803
Yeah, towel thanks.

1302
01:20:32,838 --> 01:20:34,588
All right.

1303
01:20:40,323 --> 01:20:41,900
I told you it's plain bun.

1304
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:42,733
- Bun and a burger.

1305
01:20:42,733 --> 01:20:44,576
- Burn and a burger, yeah.

1306
01:20:55,448 --> 01:20:56,828
- Is this a prank?

1307
01:21:02,211 --> 01:21:03,441
Got some more in there?

1308
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:04,274
- What is this?

1309
01:21:04,274 --> 01:21:05,480
Eat some of that yeah.

1310
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,060
- It is fine.

1311
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:07,893
Is this yours?

1312
01:21:07,893 --> 01:21:09,875
- No that is Ibar's it's okay.

1313
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:13,708
Oh it's a prank.

1314
01:21:22,021 --> 01:21:23,137
122.

1315
01:21:23,137 --> 01:21:24,329
- 122

1316
01:21:24,329 --> 01:21:25,829
122 wow!

1317
01:21:27,896 --> 01:21:30,765
- We have to go up that hill.

1318
01:21:30,765 --> 01:21:31,598
- So feeling--

1319
01:21:34,271 --> 01:21:35,316
Finish it finish it.

1320
01:21:42,008 --> 01:21:45,425
So sad Tess.

1321
01:21:52,174 --> 01:21:54,424
- So she decided to call it quits.

1322
01:21:54,424 --> 01:21:56,591
I think so yeah.

1323
01:22:18,613 --> 01:22:19,702
The record, is

1324
01:22:19,702 --> 01:22:23,090
29, that's the new record.

1325
01:22:23,090 --> 01:22:23,923
- I don't know.

1326
01:22:23,923 --> 01:22:26,468
- Yeah, it's something like 20,

1327
01:22:26,468 --> 01:22:27,721
20, 21 yeah.

1328
01:22:27,721 --> 01:22:28,892
- 29 is the highest.

1329
01:22:28,892 --> 01:22:30,319
- Wow super.

1330
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:36,083
- It was 135, the weather yesterday.

1331
01:22:37,730 --> 01:22:39,350
That's what I told to my kids you know,

1332
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:44,200
we're walking for almost two
miles at the Badwater Basin,

1333
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,870
and your dad's runnning 135 miles.

1334
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:48,293
You have to imagine that.

1335
01:22:48,293 --> 01:22:49,127
That's what he said, and then,

1336
01:22:49,127 --> 01:22:50,655
Rita Rona said, you know--

1337
01:22:53,317 --> 01:22:55,559
- you know, because you
can tell all your vacation,

1338
01:22:55,559 --> 01:22:57,753
like, no, I'm not proud of it.

1339
01:22:57,753 --> 01:22:59,501
I'm not telling anybody.

1340
01:23:09,113 --> 01:23:10,004
Donna

1341
01:23:11,889 --> 01:23:15,880
Interesting stories about Gerald.

1342
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:20,100
- Gerald is an old school guy,

1343
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:21,050
he's an old school guy.

1344
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:24,250
He's not really a techy one.

1345
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:28,560
Actually he just changed his cell phone

1346
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,930
from the flip what's that?

1347
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:30,763
It's flipped just.

1348
01:23:30,763 --> 01:23:31,596
Smartphone phone?

1349
01:23:31,596 --> 01:23:34,710
- Yeah, just three years
ago, something like that.

1350
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,770
Because his boss will get angry.

1351
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:40,600
He cannot easily accept
the picture or something.

1352
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:45,600
And then Gerald was my boyfriend
since I was 14 years old.

1353
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:47,750
And whenever he would go to our house,

1354
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:51,070
he will sit down on the same place.

1355
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:52,702
That's what I remember.

1356
01:23:52,702 --> 01:23:54,630
On that corner.

1357
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:56,390
And I did not notice about that.

1358
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:58,680
Who noticed was our housekeeper.

1359
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:00,730
Oh, you know, Gerald is a nice guy.

1360
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:01,673
He's not you know,

1361
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:05,721
I mean he has one place
to stay in our house,

1362
01:24:06,554 --> 01:24:07,920
something like that.

1363
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:09,223
So I think that's it.

1364
01:24:10,317 --> 01:24:11,514
He's a good father.

1365
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:15,480
- Yeah, because my mom and
dad, I was still young.

1366
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,550
My mom and dad don't want us to go out.

1367
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:23,240
So if he wants to see me,
he will visit in our house.

1368
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:26,550
And I wasn't able to ride in his car.

1369
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:28,490
So he would just go to our house.

1370
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:30,253
That was when I was 14 years old.

1371
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:33,800
He's my first boyfriend.

1372
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:36,673
So I love my husband very much.

1373
01:24:39,569 --> 01:24:40,402
He's coming now.

1374
01:25:07,033 --> 01:25:08,504
- It's not party time yet.

1375
01:25:08,504 --> 01:25:09,528
Oh okay.

1376
01:25:09,528 --> 01:25:10,551
- We still have 11 miles to go.

1377
01:25:10,551 --> 01:25:11,950
- Give me a dance, give me a dance.

1378
01:25:13,806 --> 01:25:14,821
Almost there.

1379
01:25:14,821 --> 01:25:17,868
Go Gerald.

1380
01:25:17,868 --> 01:25:19,521
Great job man!

1381
01:25:19,521 --> 01:25:21,545
Yeah we got it, you need
rest room or anything?

1382
01:25:21,545 --> 01:25:22,378
No, I'm good.

1383
01:25:22,378 --> 01:25:23,308
- Okay good job.

1384
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:28,064
You guys are wild--

1385
01:25:35,122 --> 01:25:36,319
Go bro, let's go.

1386
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,950
Well, what did he ask?

1387
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:46,130
- He's asking, where's the kid.

1388
01:25:46,130 --> 01:25:46,963
He's always like that.

1389
01:25:46,963 --> 01:25:48,340
He's always, you know,

1390
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:49,987
whenever we go away, he's always,

1391
01:25:49,987 --> 01:25:50,820
"Oh, where's the kids?

1392
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:51,727
"How's the kids now?

1393
01:25:51,727 --> 01:25:53,100
"Can you call them?"

1394
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,150
He's like, that was really a good father.

1395
01:26:10,862 --> 01:26:12,614
You're wearing
your jacket out really.

1396
01:26:19,211 --> 01:26:20,044
- No I'm good.

1397
01:26:20,044 --> 01:26:20,877
- You're good?

1398
01:26:20,877 --> 01:26:21,883
- Yeah I'm good.

1399
01:26:34,619 --> 01:26:36,700
- You're doing good daddy.

1400
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:37,745
Kids enjoyed.

1401
01:26:37,745 --> 01:26:39,381
- Is there a bathroom,
I'm gonna clean my teeth.

1402
01:26:39,381 --> 01:26:40,548
- Oh you want?

1403
01:26:41,746 --> 01:26:44,058
Where's the bathroom.

1404
01:26:44,058 --> 01:26:46,202
I don't know, where do yo go usually?

1405
01:26:49,997 --> 01:26:52,074
All right, have fun guys, be safe.

1406
01:26:55,512 --> 01:26:56,345
Bye bye.

1407
01:27:00,357 --> 01:27:02,080
- Right now he's more stronger though.

1408
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,590
Even though the time is really late,

1409
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:05,423
but he's still more stronger.

1410
01:27:05,423 --> 01:27:08,410
- Yeah, that's why we know that he

1411
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:10,583
can survive there.
- He's gonna be faster there

1412
01:27:10,583 --> 01:27:12,230
than usual, yeah.

1413
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:14,820
- We know that he can
survive there because,

1414
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:15,660
he's still straight.

1415
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:19,163
And then even though
29 runners DNF now so,

1416
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:21,553
even slow just okay,

1417
01:27:21,553 --> 01:27:23,036
as long as he can finish.

1418
01:27:23,036 --> 01:27:25,854
- That's why I told him,
he's tougher than Badwater.

1419
01:27:25,854 --> 01:27:26,687
- What?

1420
01:27:26,687 --> 01:27:28,450
Badwater.
- He's tougher than Badwater.

1421
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:29,820
Yeah.

1422
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:32,009
- He was like, this is
tough, but you're tougher.

1423
01:27:33,129 --> 01:27:33,962
Do you miss him?

1424
01:27:33,962 --> 01:27:35,563
Yeah.

1425
01:27:35,563 --> 01:27:37,213
- I think he's around the corner.

1426
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:40,830
Phil, yeah yeah.

1427
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:44,240
Phil is our friend, a good friend of ours.

1428
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:45,490
He's a race director of

1429
01:27:45,490 --> 01:27:49,030
the Great New York hundred miles race.

1430
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:50,860
Yeah, he's the race director.

1431
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:52,240
He's a good friend of ours.

1432
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,240
He and Gerald jam each other.

1433
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:58,333
He plays piano and Gerald
sing or whatever plays drums.

1434
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:00,810
They go together.

1435
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:02,633
He's a nice guy.

1436
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:07,380
- Gerald, sorry I missed you Lone Pine.

1437
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:08,940
I ran after you and I just missed you,

1438
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:10,650
but you got to another one man,

1439
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:12,063
congratulations crush it!

1440
01:28:13,334 --> 01:28:14,264
All right Phil.

1441
01:28:14,264 --> 01:28:15,100
- All right all right.

1442
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:15,950
I'll see you there.
- Take care.

1443
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:18,883
- I'll see you at the awards or whatever.

1444
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:22,120
Phil all ready?

1445
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:24,692
- Yeah where I saw these
guys at McDonald's.

1446
01:28:24,692 --> 01:28:27,315
- Because I want you to go with us also.

1447
01:28:27,315 --> 01:28:28,606
But you go finish.

1448
01:28:28,606 --> 01:28:29,806
When are you going home?

1449
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,090
- Tomorrow.

1450
01:28:32,090 --> 01:28:32,923
- Tomorrow?

1451
01:28:32,923 --> 01:28:33,756
Oh yeah, where are you going tomorrow?

1452
01:28:33,756 --> 01:28:35,090
- I'm not going home though.

1453
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:37,470
I'm going to New York
and then getting on a bus

1454
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:39,370
to Virginia Beach for a party,

1455
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:40,561
my cousin he's throwing for me,

1456
01:28:40,561 --> 01:28:41,430
it's along story.

1457
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:44,416
- Oh Phil, James this is Phil McCarthy

1458
01:28:44,416 --> 01:28:46,910
the race director of the Greater New York

1459
01:28:47,810 --> 01:28:50,580
100 mile running expedition.

1460
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,360
Yes, he's a good friend of

1461
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,193
Gerald.
- What kind of songs

1462
01:28:53,193 --> 01:28:54,130
do you guys sing?

1463
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:56,360
- 70s, 80s songs.

1464
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:57,230
Yeah.
- Yeah.

1465
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:59,090
He's a musician.

1466
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:00,774
- Yeah we like to jam

1467
01:29:00,774 --> 01:29:02,621
at their house.

1468
01:29:04,248 --> 01:29:05,081
Nice.

1469
01:29:05,081 --> 01:29:08,280
And he's about to break the world record.

1470
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:10,280
- Yes, we're running across the country

1471
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,640
from San Francisco to New York.

1472
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,060
That's coming up.

1473
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:15,620
- Yeah, good luck.

1474
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:17,724
You can do it Phil.

1475
01:29:19,070 --> 01:29:21,016
Yeah, Phil is a good friend of ours, yeah.

1476
01:29:21,016 --> 01:29:21,965
All right.

1477
01:29:28,025 --> 01:29:29,660
- I think I can feel just beaten down.

1478
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:32,041
How many miles more to go?

1479
01:29:32,041 --> 01:29:35,580
- We've got about six, six and a half,

1480
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:36,890
something like that to go.

1481
01:29:36,890 --> 01:29:39,510
We're gonna do two more miles.

1482
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:42,880
And then our anchor's gonna take over.

1483
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:46,460
Ibar is gonna do the last
four miles, steep four miles.

1484
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:49,790
What's the elevation
from here to the destination?

1485
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:53,320
- We're about 5,200,
we're going to about 83?

1486
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,153
- 83 right?

1487
01:29:54,153 --> 01:29:55,390
- Something like that 82, 83.

1488
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:56,838
So we've got about 3000 more.

1489
01:29:56,838 --> 01:29:57,671
3000.

1490
01:29:57,671 --> 01:30:00,760
- And then so, it's gonna
be about 500 each mile,

1491
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:02,530
particularly the last four miles.

1492
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:04,347
That's gonna be really steep.

1493
01:30:04,347 --> 01:30:06,973
So Ibar's gonna work out
for him the last four miles.

1494
01:30:09,983 --> 01:30:10,840
He might give up?

1495
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:13,735
No.

1496
01:30:13,735 --> 01:30:14,693
No.

1497
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:18,562
Last 10K come on!

1498
01:30:20,822 --> 01:30:21,684
DNF.

1499
01:30:21,684 --> 01:30:24,323
- No.

1500
01:30:24,323 --> 01:30:25,156
Last 10K.

1501
01:30:26,033 --> 01:30:27,708
I know, what do you call it?

1502
01:30:27,708 --> 01:30:30,823
One foot in front of the other.

1503
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:17,167
It's a climb.
- No, no.

1504
01:32:17,167 --> 01:32:18,000
No, 3.6.

1505
01:32:19,276 --> 01:32:20,109
You got

1506
01:32:22,003 --> 01:32:23,440
a 5K

1507
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,740
from that corner up there,

1508
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,900
you got a 5K to get up there.

1509
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:28,733
- Okay.

1510
01:32:28,733 --> 01:32:29,566
- The Badwater 5K.

1511
01:32:29,566 --> 01:32:30,793
- I'm just gonna check my,

1512
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:35,620
check all my systemic if it's working,

1513
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:36,453
and I'm good to go.

1514
01:32:36,453 --> 01:32:37,286
- Okay.

1515
01:32:38,210 --> 01:32:40,064
- I'll see you at the.

1516
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:41,637
See you at the party.

1517
01:32:41,637 --> 01:32:43,330
- Oh you not gonna go and.

1518
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:45,580
- No, I got people to watch.

1519
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:46,660
- Gotcha.

1520
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:47,493
- Okay.

1521
01:32:47,493 --> 01:32:48,326
- Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

1522
01:32:48,326 --> 01:32:49,159
- Yes, thank you.

1523
01:32:49,159 --> 01:32:52,293
- How many people have a DNF so far?

1524
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:54,970
We have 29.

1525
01:32:55,822 --> 01:32:56,655
29?

1526
01:32:56,655 --> 01:32:57,795
- 29 is the count for DNF.

1527
01:32:57,795 --> 01:32:59,450
Is that a
record breaking number?

1528
01:32:59,450 --> 01:33:02,100
- Of that that I don't know,
but it is a very high number.

1529
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:04,170
It's almost one third of the total

1530
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:08,343
count of racers, yeah.

1531
01:33:09,909 --> 01:33:11,583
- I have pin this one,

1532
01:33:11,583 --> 01:33:13,206
I will be the 30th.
- You will.

1533
01:33:14,299 --> 01:33:15,593
Yeah right?

1534
01:33:15,593 --> 01:33:17,790
- Right, no you gonna finish.

1535
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:18,699
You gonna finish.

1536
01:33:18,699 --> 01:33:19,532
I've already put you down
here you're gonna finish so.

1537
01:33:23,221 --> 01:33:24,230
- No turning back.

1538
01:33:24,230 --> 01:33:25,187
- Okay, thank you.

1539
01:33:25,187 --> 01:33:27,691
- I said, I'm not gonna give him the 30.

1540
01:33:28,524 --> 01:33:31,064
- You know, you do not want to be the 30

1541
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:32,863
- Yeah.
- No.

1542
01:33:54,606 --> 01:33:55,923
- Thank you.

1543
01:33:55,923 --> 01:33:56,960
Welcome I will see
you at the finish tonight.

1544
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,400
- All right thank you
so much, see you later.

1545
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,990
Finish line.

1546
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:02,120
Ibar finish line.

1547
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,415
- Yep.

1548
01:34:08,344 --> 01:34:10,147
It's not gonna be easy.

1549
01:34:10,147 --> 01:34:11,805
Going back to the hotel.

1550
01:34:20,233 --> 01:34:23,770
- Section by section, one mile at a time.

1551
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:28,003
Yeah that's the best strategy
for running long distance.

1552
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:31,253
You don't have to think
about 135 miles ahead.

1553
01:34:32,307 --> 01:34:34,803
You just think about
one station at a time,

1554
01:34:34,803 --> 01:34:36,740
like 17 miles, 42 miles.

1555
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:38,160
And then that 17 miles,

1556
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:40,780
you have to cut into another section

1557
01:34:41,617 --> 01:34:46,133
until one foot in front
of the other.
