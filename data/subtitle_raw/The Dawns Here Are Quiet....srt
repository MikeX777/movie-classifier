REAL-DAKOTA INTERFIEST

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It was May, 1942.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In the west, on gray nights
you could hear the sounds of artillery,

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Both sides buried in the ground by 2 meters
holding your positions firmly

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
they finally stopped in trench warfare.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In the east, the Germans bombed day and night
the canal and the Kirov main railway line.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In the afternoon, they waged persistent fights
blocked Leningrad.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,840
There was a resort here.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,070
Several farms were saved at the 181st junction
on a long line of earth.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The Germans did it from time to time
over the turnout and command

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
just in case it kept there
two anti-aircraft stands.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,430
Kumo!
Do you plant potatoes?

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I will drink your Wasia, live!
I still have to work for these apples!

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,090
In my garden, when he comes back ...

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,720
SO SILENT HERE AT DUSK ...

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,620
Based on the novel
Boris Vasiliev

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Due to silence and laziness, soldiers quartered
they had a sauna here.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
There was enough left in twelve houses
young virgins and widows,

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
who can make a moonshine
almost from the humming noise.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Three days, the soldiers slept asleep, they watched,

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and on the fourth someone's name day began,
and over the junction

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,510
the smell of local moonshine did not dissipate ...

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,070
Fiedot Yevgraficz!

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Fiedot Yevgraficz!

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,630
- Fedot Yevgraficz!
Don't make noise! ​​What happened?

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,470
Again...

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,130
Stop it! Enough!

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So what, WaЬkow?
You'll be reprimanded.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,280
And back to the front, away from that nonsense.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Send non-drinkers ...
Hey, non-drinkers ...

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Two teams, nearly 20 people, non-drinkers.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Even if you search the entire front - you also doubt ...

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Send those who do not drink, and that ...
As for the women ...

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,240
Maybe you want eunuchs?
I do not know. Superiors know better.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
- We will finish the enemy and right at you!
Yes, I know your soon ...

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
When I get there, please write ...

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,840
Okay, WaЬkow, get the non-drinkers.
And as for women too ... It will ...

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But this time, watch out, Sergeant,
and you can't cope with them ...

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,020
Pluto, to the carts!

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,580
Sergeant, we'll meet after the war!

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Higher nose, Yevgraficz!
Tomorrow I will bring new ones.

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,560
Maybe a week.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,220
What about you?
Your army ... has arrived.

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Finally.
The second day, a turnout without defense.

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Have they come with the commander?
I don't like it.

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And praise God ...
Because I'm already worried.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,190
To enjoy too early ...

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,480
Collector!

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,010
Come on! Attention!

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Comrade Sergeant. First team
third platoon of the fifth company,

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
an independent air defense battalion
came under your command to protect the facility.

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The team commissioner, Sergeant Keryanov, reports.

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,800
So they found ... non-drinkers.

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Anti-aircraft guns, by the way,
they lived after cha│ups ...

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We're not an anti-aircraft gun.
We're anti-aircraft guns.

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Or maybe more correctly recruits?
Who was fighting besides you?

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You insult us, Comrade Sergeant,
we are under fire.

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Junior Sergeant Osjanin,
how many are you targeting?

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,190
Too little ... for now.

63
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,450
What is your name
Private Bryczkin.

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Jelizaveta.
Are you from the village?

65
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes. This is.
I see ...

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Take an example of how to use the tools.

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,800
Where are you from?
We are from Siberia.

68
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
From over the Yenisei.
Yeah...

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,660
A country not close ...

70
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Why are you here?
Can't you see I'm deploying staff?

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,870
- Because ... borscht is ready.
What about borscht?

72
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,480
It will cool down.

73
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
By the way, Comrade Sergeant -
take care of the room ...

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What room?

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,620
No bushes can be seen nearby ...

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Higher Gray ...
We're out of luck, girls.

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
One boy and his lap is full.

78
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Sure they lived after the chaos
and he with the hostess on the stove.

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,770
It's not true!

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Girls, we have a crush on our Briczkina!

81
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Dushka fell in love with a soldier ...

82
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,720
Poor Lisa!

83
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
LYSE BRICZKIN

84
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,400
The whole life of Lisa Briczkina
She lived in anticipation of tomorrow.

85
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,030
Where!
Here - I told you!

86
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:43,000
She waited every morning
impatiently happy.

87
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The more that the life situation
she postponed the meeting

88
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
with this Christmas happiness for tomorrow.

89
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
They didn't kill her, they didn't destroy her,
but they only translated.

90
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,720
Even when together with the family
they were called the enemies of the Soviet power,

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
they took a house, a farm,

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and with thousands of such boys,
they sent the ku│akєw to Siberia,

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,660
even then it didn't kill her faith
to the bright happiness of tomorrow.

94
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Eastern Siberia, February 1941

95
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,620
So was her childhood.

96
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,770
What do you want?

97
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,250
what, boring?
Boring.

98
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I left your father's address.

99
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,340
You will come in the summer, send you to a technical college.

100
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,890
You will die here.

101
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,240
And stupidity ... no need to do,
even out of boredom.

102
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,650
You can go.

103
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,390
Will you take a lift to the city?
Get in the back, girl ... Get in!

104
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Next time try to be earlier.

105
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
His eyes are full of eyesight.
Is waiting for you...

106
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,650
Well.

107
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,940
He will wake up in the morning
you are not here and he gets nervous ...

108
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,360
Cє┐ ...

109
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,650
Watch out there!

110
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,650
Hфnde hoch!

111
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,960
What if it was Germany?
Where does Germany come from, Comrade Sergeant?

112
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
- Belts ...
What?

113
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,720
Photo belts!

114
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,240
Three days in arrest for violation
front zone discipline.

115
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,480
Yes...

116
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
One must knock, comrade Sergeant -
it's not your home or your barracks.

117
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
what is this?
You do not recognize?

118
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You expose.
There is an order.

119
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What order?
Suitable.

120
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Female soldiers were allowed to dry out
underwear on all fronts.

121
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,700
The commander-in-chief personally ordered.
Have you not heard?

122
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,650
Damn it...

123
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This spring, Fedot Yevgrafich
are 32 years old.

124
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Until then, you considered your life successful.

125
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,700
Despite his incomplete four classes
he graduated from a punch school

126
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,900
and reached the rank of sergeant.

127
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,000
FIEDOT WASKOW
To marry a nurse from the garrison hospital,
who bore him a baby ...

128
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And that's when the Finnish war began,
WaЬkow went to the front.

129
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,790
Sortawa│a, December 1939.

130
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And after hurting,
when I was in the hospital,

131
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
His wife cheated on him with a punch vet
and went south.

132
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Fiedot divorced her, and the boy
picked up through a court

133
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and sent to my mother in the countryside.

134
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,250
And after a year his son died.

135
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Since then, WaЬkow has smiled
only three times.

136
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
To the general who gave him the award,
to the surgeon who took out the bullet

137
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,170
and to his landlady, Maria Nikiforowna,
for default.

138
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,530
Come on!

139
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,890
Cannon for battle!

140
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,650

143
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000

Ready.

144
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,960
Short! Fire!

145
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,650
Azimuth 290.

146
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Distance 2500.

147
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,410
Ready.

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,960
guess! Load faster!

149
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,890
- Nadia!
drinking?

150
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,480
You what ...

151
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,460
- Azimuth 320. Altitude 2900.
- It's 2900.

152
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,500
Distance 3400.
Shoot!

153
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,130
Cheeky girls!

154
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,440
Look, the pilot pops out ...

155
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Leave it alone, Rita. You won't hit him
don't waste any ammo.

156
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,670
Loaded.
- Stop it!

157
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,240
Who?

158
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,090
What didobi│aЬ?
I will give you to the tribunal!

159
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,090
RITA OSJANINA

160
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,330
comrade major ...
I know...

161
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
A shot down plane, whose job?
- Commander of the second unit,

162
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
junior sergeant of Osjanin
Zuch, Osjanina.

163
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's a pity you didn't catch the Live Pilot.

164
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I would ask him what he is doing in your area.

165
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Maybe off course ...

166
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,790
Okay, take the supplement.

167
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,720
The woman at the front, you understand
it is an object of constant attention ...

168
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,420
There are times when you can't stand it ...
what do you mean?

169
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
One staff commander,
Married, by the way,

170
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,610
found a friend.

171
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,640
A member of the Military Council found out about this.

172
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Show me that friend

173
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and you asked me to arrange it
good collective.

174
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,090
do you have a good collective here?
I understand.

175
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,810
Will you let me go, Comrade Major?
Go away.

176
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Commander of Osjanin's unit.
Private Gurwicz ..

177
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Private Czerwiertak.

178
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,200
Private Komilkov.

179
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,200
FIREWORKS

180
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,000
MOSCOW
May-41

181
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh, my are here ...
- Congratulations, Dad!

182
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Stalin handed over in person?

183
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yes - and my hand shook it.

184
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And pass it on. Meet each other, Alexei -
my daughter Evgenia.

185
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Do not trust the angelic appearance -
there is a devil inside.

186
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,440
пeniu - this is Lieutenant Lieutenant Guin.
We fought together in the Finnish war.

187
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,500
пenia ... He is married.

188
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,440
A new city, a whole new life ...

189
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,010
Good morning.
Hello.

190
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,140
Equivalent!
Attention!

191
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Comrades Soldiers - For Your Courage
during the battle ...

192
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I was ordered to advertise in the garrison
bathing day.

193
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,770
Extraordinary.

194
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
пenia, you are like a Russian!
Your skin is transparent.

195
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Poor woman - yes a figure
wrapped in uniform ...

196
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,640
She is beautiful.
Beautiful and rarely happy.

197
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,900
Are you talking about yourself?

198
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Sleeping, you can walk without a bra.
Oh no...

199
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Beautiful underwear is my weakness.

200
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,700
Only a sergeant
I can't resist.
(But it will stop!)

201
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Nobody can resist such a beauty.
(Oh, it will stop!)

202
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Beauty, Ga│ka - is the work of human hands.

203
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,030
Make you a beauty today!

204
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,420
We wrinkle the sweatshirt where it needs to be
and you won't be able to take your eyes off!

205
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
If you want, take care of you.

206
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I was kidding about the sergeant, kidding ...

207
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Take it if you want.
Sleep, take care of me.

208
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Press the sergeant today -
let it warm up!

209
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,220
and me!
- Come on!

210
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,570
Shame...
Yes Rita? Let me gossip ... this is some activity ...

211
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And fall in love as you like,
I won't say a word.

212
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
But to annoy someone for no reason -
I don't understand this.

213
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,830
Do not understand?

214
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,160
Why don't you tell me where you run at night?

215
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Sleep, why don't you sing something?

216
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,220
Girls, Penia knows so many songs ...

217
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
My mom, sister, brother ...

218
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
They all killed with a machine gun.
Was there a warning?

219
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,770
Shooting ...

220
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:47,000
The commander's family caught up -
and a machine gun ...

221
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And I managed to hide
in the house next door.

222
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,140
I've seen everything ...

223
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,480
penia ...

224
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,720
And the colonel?

225
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,660
How could you?

226
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,720
Cє┐ I could!

227
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I can ...

228
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Red Sio
staff of the 11 rifle division.
September 1941.

229
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Staц.

230
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Comrade Colonel,
delivered detained.

231
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,570
Who is this?
Who knows, Maybe a spy, Or maybe ...

232
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,350
penia!

233
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,720
Now you're gonna raise me
or later, after a tip?

234
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,310
Comrade Sergeant!

235
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,180
What do you want?

236
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
what happened
- Germany is in the forest!

237
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
How do you know?
I saw it for myself.

238
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,810
Two, with vending machines.
In camouflage uniforms ...

239
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Makaricz was killed.

240
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,660
Ah yes...

241
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Declare combat readiness.
Kerjanov to me! Run!

242
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Pine!

243
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
His maц ... пre or Ьpi ...
Pine!

244
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Pine, I'm listening.
- Says the 17th. Give me a third!

245
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,570
- Come on now! It's urgent!
Don't yell! Urgent ...

246
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
is that you, WaЬkow?
- Yes, comrade the third!

247
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
what's up
- Germany is in the woods near position!

248
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
We discovered them today, two in number.
Who will discover?

249
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Junior Sergeant Osjanin.
I sounded the alarm, comrade third.

250
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I thought to comb the forest.
How did they look? Your Germany ...

251
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Masked, he says, with vending machines.
Probably the saboteurs!

252
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Take five people from the squad
and shoot my feet the trace will not cool down!

253
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,680
Yes, comrade third!

254
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So on this path you met them?

255
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,700
Here. They walked past me
towards the road.

256
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and backpacks, you say, they had?
Yes, on the back.

257
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I think TNT was good.

258
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,480
And since they are carrying loads, they can
the highway is not their goal.

259
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,330
On the railroad.
On the Kirovskaya railway road, I mean ...

260
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
An enemy has been located nearby,
in the number of two.

261
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Our task to catch up with the enemy,
and taken captive.

262
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
In extreme cases, kill.

263
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Junior Sergeant Osjanin.

264
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,900
Step forward.

265
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,940
Choose four soldiers
from his branch.

266
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Komilkov's soldier.
I am.

267
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
a soldier four-drill.
I am.

268
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,590
That's enough.

269
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
We will be Lapats to Germany, not fish.
Take those that can shoot.

270
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,160
I can shoot.
Father taught me.

271
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Briczkin's soldier.

272
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
One more thing ... Maybe someone knows German?
I.

273
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
What is this "me"? What does "I" mean?
You have to register.

274
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,010
soldier Gurwicz.

275
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,310
Maybe someone else knows?

276
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
- How will it be "hands up"?
- Hфnde hoch!

277
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,550
Exactly ...
Let it be Gurwicz.

278
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Cє┐, at least we won't get wet.
All take off your shoes.

279
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I ordered nothing.
At least it's good not to undress ...

280
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,530
Gadu│y ...

281
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yes...

282
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,010
With such onucami, after three kilometers
you rub your legs to blood.

283
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Yes, clean your weapons
onuce humanly sewn ...

284
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Who needs to be taught!
Get in order and get ready.

285
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Get ammunition and packed lunch
for two days.

286
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,920
40 minutes for everything.
Perform.

287
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,680
Are you from the city?
You can see ...

288
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,920
Okay, I must write, obligatory!

289
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,340
SONIA GURWICZ
Minsk, October 1940

290
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,710
Good morning.

291
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,360
Sonia!

292
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,190
... Today at 4 am,

293
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,510
without a declaration of war,
german army

294
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
attacked our borders
in many places...

295
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,230
Sonia, let's go soon.
I was afraid you would not come ...

296
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,840
For cars!

297
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's B│ok.
I marked there in the book ...

298
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,150
Goodbye, Sonia ...
It is mandatory to write.

299
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Sonia did not receive his letter.

300
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
He died at the end of October from
all your companions,

301
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
in the composition of one of Moscow
the mass-launch division

302
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,380
in the circle of WiaЯm╣.

303
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So yes ... Listen to me.

304
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
A replacement for the duration of the operation
I appointed a younger Sergeant Osjaninъ.

305
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
If an enemy is detected,
or something unclear ...

306
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,510
Who can imitate an animal or a bird?

307
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,900
I am seriously asking!

308
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
In a forest, information cannot be given with a voice.
Germany has ears too.

309
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,500
I can.
Like a donkey.

310
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,840
Osw a lot ...

311
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,210
Okay, let's get quacks.
Like ducks.

312
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
This is how the drake calls the female.
- You speak well!

313
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,480
The signals will be as follows:
twice: ATTENTION - I see the enemy.

314
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Three times - everyone to me. Sure?

315
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,420
For me.

316
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,560
WaЬkow realized that
That if the target of the Germans

317
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,000
there is a diversion on the Kirov railway line -

318
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
one of the most important transport arteries,
which was delivered from the Allies to the front ...

319
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
This stopping them isn't just that
task of local importance.

320
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
A turn to Lake Wope, which was discovered by WaЬkow
still during the Finnish war

321
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The Germans could not know
there were only swamps on the maps.

322
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So the Germans had a turn
only one way.

323
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,920
To the lake via Siniuchin╣ │╣kъ.

324
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,980
And it was impossible for them to miss those little marks.

325
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Well, the Germans are marching.

326
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Very good, even.

327
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,710
About 40 km.

328
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,760
Come on ...

329
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,000
Your father and mother live somewhere,
are you an orphan

330
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,130
I am an orphan.
You could say an orphan ...

331
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,000
You're not sure yourself?

332
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And Who Is Sure Now, Comrade Sergeant?
You're right.

333
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
My parents are in Minsk, I studied in Moscow,
I was preparing for the session.

334
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,400
and suddenly...
Do you have a photo?

335
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,760
What are you guys?

336
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,980
Parents are hesitating?
Naturally.

337
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,230
Naturally?
If it were natural, I wouldn't be asking.

338
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Sonia did not know
and she couldn't know </i>

339
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
That her mother, Wiera Josifowna Gurwicz,

340
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,690
at that time she was wearing
on the chest the ╣thъ starъ </i>

341
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
and the number soulless number of the camp
Little Trostiniec. </i>

342
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,230
Neither her father nor her sister
She was no longer alive. </i>

343
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,010
Maybe they got lost?

344
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Private Gurwicz,
acidify three times.

345
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Why?
To check combat readiness.

346
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,050
Did you forget how I taught?
No, I have not forgotten.

347
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
what happened
If anything happened ...

348
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
The Archangels would already be you
in that world they greeted.

349
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,280
You run like calves.
With a raised tail ...

350
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
What did you see along the way?
Gray order: younger sergeant Osjanin ...

351
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Probably nothing ... She was at the turn
z│aman╣ ga│╣Я.

352
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Bravo. Truth.

353
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Closing?
I didn't notice anything.

354
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Everything's fine.

355
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Dew is knocked off the bushes.

356
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
On the left he is holding
but on the right it fell off the road.

357
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,880
They are eyes!
Bravo the Red Army officer Briczkina.

358
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And there were still two tracks on the way,
German shoe

359
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
what their paratroopers wear.

360
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Judging by the tracks,
I want to circle around the marshes.

361
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,300
And let's go.
Because we'll take these swamps to pass.

362
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,340
Now you can smoke
from 15 minutes.

363
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,030
Who needs it can improve.

364
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,380
Quietly! And don't diverge!

365
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Yes. The route is dangerous.
The order of movement will be as follows:

366
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,670
I am first, followed by Gurwicz,

367
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Briczkin, Komilków, Czetwiertak.

368
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Junior sergeant Osjanin closes up.
Are there any questions?

369
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Deep there?
Sometimes it happens ...

370
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,320
To you ...
Waist, I mean ...

371
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,320
Watch out for rifles.

372
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,340
Mud gas comes out.
We moved it ...

373
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
People like that
incredible things tell ...

374
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
they are fairy tales, of course
Are the leeches here?

375
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
There is nothing here.
Dead place ...

376
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,420
And above him we ...

377
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,630
Comrade Sergeant,
my shoe will fall off my leg!

378
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Damn it...
Found?

379
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,190
No.
We must iЬц.

380
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
How without shoes?
How do you find him now?

381
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,460
Come on! Go ahead, follow me.
Don't stay.

382
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Stay on the path, don't move!
- Help her!

383
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,500
Stop it! There is no going back!

384
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Easy easy!

385
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Not much left to the island.

386
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,610
We will rest there.
Drive.

387
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Further it will be easier.
We'll get to the dry birch and take it easy.

388
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
How will I be without the shoe?
we made up something.

389
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,670
But already beyond the swamp.
Will you hold out?

390
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It's cold, girls.
I'm all wet.

391
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,110
Do you think I'm dry?
I have a drink once and for all ...

392
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Well, comrades soldiers ...

393
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
We take paths and follow me,
in the same order.

394
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,130
Leave them here.

395
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
A little more, comrade Red Army,
make an effort.

396
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,570
A little further, we will rest at the waterfall.

397
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Well, comrade Red Army,
everything okay?

398
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Everything is all right, Comrade Sergeant.

399
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Are you not frozen?

400
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,610
There is no one to warm us to anyway.

401
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And how? It's good?

402
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,880
Even a lot. Thank youъ
Comrade Sergeant.

403
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Come on, comrade soldiers.

404
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,460
We still have an hour and a half to get there.

405
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
How quiet it is!

406
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,710
As in Ьnie.

407
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,570
From the left
Sinjuchina │╣ka begins.

408
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
On the other hand, another lake
It goes hand in hand with this.

409
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
His name is Leguntowo.
There used to be a monk here.

410
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
His name was Legun.
What elusive are you looking for here ...

411
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's full of ...

412
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Germany has only one way between
lakes, through │╣ki.

413
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
We'll wait for them here.

414
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Before we can come, we need to find the positions.

415
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,510
Main and spare - as prescribed by the regulations.

416
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,730
We will choose and we will wait.

417
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Obey a combat order.

418
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
A row of up to two
armed with Fryc's teeth

419
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
moves in the Lake Wope region in order
reaching the Kirov railway line

420
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
and the Bia│omorsko-Baltic canal,
name of comrade Stalin.

421
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Our branch, in the amount of 6 people,

422
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,000
ordered to defend │╣kъ Sinjuchin,
where we are to take the enemy captive.

423
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Neighbor on the left - Lake Wope,
neighbor on the right - Lake Leguntowo.

424
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,480
Questions?

425
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,440
Please go to position.

426
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,380
Maybe we are sitting for nothing?

427
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,530
I doubt ...

428
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,650
That's what I mean - if those Frycw
not confused with tree stumps.

429
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
You can sleep, comrade sergeant.
Wake you up at dawn.

430
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Come on with this sleeping, Osjanina.

431
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
We will have eternal sleep
if Frycєw we sleep.

432
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,500
Well, maybe they're sleeping now?

433
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,260
Fedot Yevgraficz?

434
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Мpi╣ ...
Cє┐, Yes.

435
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
These are people too.

436
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You said yourselves that │╣ka Sinjuchina
this is the only possible transition to the railroad.

437
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
There is no other ...
Wait Osjanin ...

438
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,420
Hold on.

439
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,980
We walked from fifty kilometers ...

440
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
But in an unknown place
every bush is terrible.

441
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Are you thinking right?
Yes, Comrade Sergeant.

442
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And if so, it might be safe
resting somewhere right now.

443
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,320
And I'll fall until the sun.

444
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Shall we smoke, Comrade Rita?
Don't smoke.

445
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,070
Yes ... It's like ...

446
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
The fact that these are also like people ...

447
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,380
I didn't understand that a bit.

448
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,150
Okay you said - I need to rest.

449
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,340
You, too, rest.
Go look at the items.

450
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,400
How's it going, Briczkina
Didn't you notice anything?

451
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
quiet for now.
Watch everything.

452
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Do the bushes move,
do the birds fear anything?

453
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,590
You are a man From the woods, you understand everything.
I understand.

454
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
What, Jelizaweta, did you work in the camp?

455
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
No. Mostly I was helping my father.

456
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,340
He is a forester, we lived in the forest.

457
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
At least you quiver well.

458
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Lisa, Lisa, Lisawieta,
why don't you like me

459
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,880
Why don't you sing to me -
not suitable for you? "

460
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
There is a chant in our pages.

461
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And here they sang ...
Later we will sing, Jelizawiec.

462
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,090
We'll follow our orders, then we'll sing.

463
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,340
Do you promise?
I did say.

464
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Be careful, comrade sergeant.
You promised me.

465
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Born in difficult years
We don't remember our way.

466
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,860
We - children of Russia's terrible years
We cannot forget anything.

467
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:06,260
Fingers for the ashes of summer!
Is there hope in you?

468
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:10,000
From the days of war, from the days of freedom ... "

469
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,780
Who are you reading to?

470
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Anyone. Myself.

471
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,980
Why out loud?
They are poems.

472
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
You spoil your eyes.
It is clear, Comrade Sergeant.

473
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,780
I at all ...

474
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Don't sit on stones.

475
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
They will cool down quickly and will be pulled on
you are warm. You won't notice.

476
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Put on a stick.
All right, Comrade Sergeant. Thank you.

477
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And don't read aloud.

478
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
At night, the air is thick, humid ...

479
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Quiet here at dusk
five kilometers away.

480
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,400
Watch.
Watch, ┐o│nierz Gurwicz.

481
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,500
Dyed?
Natural.

482
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,210
Cluttered.
Nothing, Nothing, fix it.

483
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,980
Comrade Sergeant, are you married?

484
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I am married, soldier of Komilków.
Where is your wife?

485
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
You know where ... At home.

486
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,780
Do you have children?

487
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,610
Kids...
You were a boy ...

488
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,780
How was it?

489
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
He died.

490
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,960
Just before the war.

491
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Died?

492
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,230
Yes.

493
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,900
There was no one to watch.

494
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,320
She feels like ... she has abandoned us.

495
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Why did you curl up like this, comrade soldier?
It is cold.

496
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,210
Yes, you got wet.
Show my forehead.

497
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,630
You have temperature, comrade soldier.
You feel?

498
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,090
It's because of the swamp ...
And the shoe is lost.

499
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
So you take it to drink.
what is this?

500
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Mixture.

501
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,480
Hold on.

502
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
- Potion ... Spirit!
Spirit, Yes. and what?

503
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,400
No, I won't be five.
Carry out the order.

504
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And immediately water ...

505
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
What are you saying, my mom
is a medical worker.

506
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,550
Mom is not here.
War is ...

507
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
And Germany is. Mom will be with those
who survived the war.

508
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,710
Are you clear?

509
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,230
Drink!

510
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,070
Don't inhale. You have.

511
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,610
Something like escaped my head ...

512
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,380
That `s nothing. You'll catch up tomorrow.

513
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Rest, comrade soldier.

514
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And you? Yes, without a coat?

515
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Don't be afraid, I'm healthy.
Light up and get warm ...

516
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,190
It's okay ... Get well.

517
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,550
Mom is gone.
War is ...

518
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,830
And Germany is. Mother will be with those
who survived the war.

519
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:14,130
GALIA CZETWIERTAK

520
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,260
What about moj╣ Gal╣?
Gala!

521
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
- Rita!
What?

522
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,380
Quiet, quiet ...
Hear that?

523
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,840
The birds screamed.

524
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,920
Magpies. The magpies are awake, Rita.

525
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Someone disturbed them.

526
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Looks like we have guests.

527
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
GoЯ, Osjanina, housing the soldiers.
Quick but easy.

528
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,320
lest they get scared.
And he translates to me!

529
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Good morning, Comrade Sergeant
Hi.

530
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
How's Czetwiertak?
Мpi.

531
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
We decided not to wake her up.
Correct decision.

532
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,630
I will be in range of your voice.
But don't show yourself.

533
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,900
He did not show himself.

534
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,650
Come on...

535
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,530
Come on ...

536
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Here they are.

537
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,710
Both. Two.

538
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Three.

539
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Four...

540
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,420
Five ...

541
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Six.

542
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,960
Seven eight...

543
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,260
Nine, ten ...

544
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,440
Eleven, twelve ...

545
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
fourteen, fifteen.

546
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,650
Sixteen.

547
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,650
Sixteen!

548
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Comrade Sergeant,
There were two of them.

549
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,420
It was ...

550
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:49,280
I mean, these two were just scouting.

551
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,000
Gurwicz, listen.

552
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Send me Briczkin, just quietly.

553
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Crawl, comrade translator!

554
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,920
Life depends on it, do you understand?

555
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,690
Comrade Sergeant,
Comrade Sergeant ...

556
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:28,500
What about you?
Smile, Briczkina.

557
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:33,000
It is even better that it is theirs
sixteen, not two.

558
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
We would look for two in the forest,
oh yes they are here!

559
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Way back Do you remember well?
Yes, Comrade Sergeant.

560
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Listen, the Germans have left the pine forest.

561
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
You'll go there, and then along the lake.
where we have cut the bars.

562
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Cheek girl. From there you will go
to the stream. Won't you get lost?

563
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
No, comrade Sergeant.
No. So fast, Yelisawto.

564
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
The swamp is the most important.
The road is narrow.

565
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Step left, right, there will be a problem.
Landmark - birch.

566
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Then two pines,
that are on the island.

567
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Rest a bit there,
don't go right away.

568
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Yes: weapons, backpack, bags - everything
leave here. You'll come faster.

569
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Report the situation to Kerijanov.

570
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
We'll take some Germans,
but we can do it too long, you know ...

571
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,320
So ... Now I have iЬц?

572
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,820
Yes...
Don't forget to tense in front of the swamps.

573
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,670
So run ...
PъdЯ, Jelizawieta.

574
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,260
Ple is, girls.
Пle ...

575
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
There are sixteen of them,
and sixteen machines are power.

576
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
You will not stop such a force in front of you,
We can't forgive either ...

577
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,630
And I'll be here in an hour or two
I think so ...

578
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
How are you feeling
I'm fine. I slept well.

579
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I sent Briczkina to the quarters.

580
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
We can count on support before the night.
Not before.

581
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
If we start fighting them,
we won't make it through the night.

582
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
We will not stop at any positions.

583
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
So what? Are we supposed to watch you go by?

584
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
We can't let them pass
straight on through │╣kъ.

585
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
You have to beat them off the course.
Let it come in a circle.

586
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Directing around the Leguntowo lake.

587
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
But how?

588
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Of course they didn't come here
to fight.

589
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
In this case, please be careful
to slip silently ...

590
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
So they must see us.

591
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,380
And that we didn't notice them ....

592
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Then maybe I'll go somewhere else
and try elsewhere.

593
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Another place is around Lake Leguntowo -
one day's march.

594
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
But who should I show them? Mustache?

595
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,650
Or yourself?

596
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,440
Stop, scout out.
And find out there are only five of us.

597
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:30,170
If for an hour, a half
we won't come up with anything else ...

598
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Comrade Sergeant, what if?
came across lumberjacks?

599
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
What woodcutters? There is a war
the forests are empty, you just saw ...

600
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,570
now women are cutting forests.
Women...

601
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It is true...

602
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Forest workers work in brigades.

603
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Look for them there in that bush.

604
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
You can't kill everyone
one shot.

605
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And if you miss one

606
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
everything will tell who needs ...

607
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,960
Cє┐ girls

608
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,900
the eagle is mine!

609
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Comrade Sergeant,
Comrade Sergeant!

610
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,590
Here come!

611
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,530
Help me.

612
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,480
Further...

613
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
On your seats, girls.
Komilkowa, for me!

614
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,130
Shout louder.

615
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Maybe they escaped?
Maybe they escaped ...

616
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,730
Or maybe not.
They are not green either ...

617
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
They don't send just anyone for such a job.

618
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,530
Wait ...

619
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,480
I see ...

620
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:31,860
Recon.

621
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,570
Count us on your fingers.
Take care of them ...

622
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,960
This is probably a stupid idea.

623
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
But you girls ... maybe even ...

624
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
... you will be able to escape.

625
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,300
Stєj!

626
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,920
Raja, Wiera, go and have a bath.

627
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
If you don't want to ...

628
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,420
It is not!

629
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,860
Girls, get bathed!

630
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,570
Call Ivan!
Hey, Vaniusz, where are you?

631
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,230
Goъ!

632
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,480
Let's go!

633
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
- Wait a minute!
- And wait for me!

634
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Who will work?

635
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,530
Goъ, goъ!

636
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Where are you
Hear that?

637
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,340
Who will be working, I ask?
Come on over here.

638
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Turn off. Ah you ...

639
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
They called from the area
the car is coming soon.

640
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Enough, get out.
Get out, he said.

641
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,800
Enough, I order you to leave.

642
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,030
Get out! That's enough.
Give me a hand!

643
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Go out, go out, play with fire ...

644
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,500
Come on, come on, go on, go!

645
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,530
Go ...

646
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,650
Go ...

647
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
OK...

648
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,650
Now girls ...

649
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:36,380
Now we have no place to go.

650
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
If Briczkina, of course
support will not bring ...

651
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,780
Will bring.

652
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,050
In that case, let's drink a little ...
To her fast legs.

653
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,260
And your bright heads.

654
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:32,000
Look...
This is the culture of the Germans ...

655
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
They wanted coffee.
Why do you think so?

656
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,770
I can smell rum ...

657
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
So they stopped for breakfast.

658
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
But are all sixteen?

659
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
We have to count them, Margarita.

660
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,310
Who hasn't gone ...

661
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:19,500
12 people, two on guard.

662
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
So they're all here.

663
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,680
These two went on scouting.

664
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:32,100
They stood for a long time.
Dry the linen.

665
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
It's about time - we can change
our items, Margarita.

666
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I have a little look around at the rocks.

667
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,690
And you and the girls are going
to the spare position.

668
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Just quiet.
I understand.

669
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Wait!

670
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I spread the tobacco there to dry, take it away.
And my clothes, of course.

671
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,680
I will take, Fedota Yevgraficz.

672
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,260
Did you bring the pouch?

673
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I forgot ...

674
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Fiedota Yevgraficz, dear ...

675
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,500
I don't ... Okay ...
Well there ...

676
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
The smaller of machork╣ ...

677
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,390
At least you didn't forget your backpack?

678
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:11,100
Bring it! I know where it is.
- Yep, Soldier Gurwicz! Comrade translator!

679
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,680
Private Gurwicz shouted.

680
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Komilkow for me.

681
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,260
Remain here to wait!

682
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,420
Germany...

683
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,720
Not good...

684
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,600
Not good.

685
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
That's why she screamed.
Hit inaccurately, must have been tall.

686
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
He missed the heart the first time.
Her breast interrupted.

687
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,560
Pole┐ here, Sonieczko ...

688
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,960
Get some rest.
They're here somewhere.

689
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,350
Here they are.

690
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Stay here and when I pass by
occupy them with something.

691
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Stone, ga│ъzi╣ -
as long as they don't see you.

692
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,460
I'll take care of them. Understand?
I understand.

693
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,340
Zuch, Komilkowa.
I am thankful to you.

694
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,150
Now ... Two already ... less left.

695
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,030
Leave me alone ...

696
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
You have to get used to it, drink ...

697
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
To lose your soul.

698
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Here and the grown men suffer seriously.

699
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,890
And understand one thing ...

700
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
These aren't people.

701
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Not men, not even animals ...

702
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,720
They are fascists!

703
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:59,430
And draw the appropriate conclusions.

704
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
You will find our Sam?
Find.

705
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,190
Go. Go to Sonia.

706
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,760
Don't wait long there,
later we will cry ...

707
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:39,730
Only no hysteria.

708
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:44,600
She was an exemplary student ...
Perfect in everything.

709
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,850
Both at school and at the university ...

710
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:54,260
Most importantly, there are no children
that would be sad ...

711
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:58,160
Neither my own nor someone else's ...

712
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,000
Now they won't be ...

713
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,500
A chain of generations ...

714
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,600
They cut it.

715
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
We will mark on the map.

716
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,730
And after the war, we will erect a monument!

717
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,260
what is this?
Boots.

718
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,100
I will not.
Why are you doing this?

719
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
because we have a barefoot soldier.
- Don't!

720
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
These are not good things, girls ...

721
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
In war, there is only one rule -
you have to think only of the living.

722
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
- Assume, order!
You can't ...

723
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,000
My mother is a medical worker ...
Stop lying. You don't have a mother.

724
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,000
And never did.
I read your papers.

725
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
You're an orphan - Don't be confused.
Why are you doing this?

726
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Why?
Don't be malicious.

727
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,650
Otherwise, we will become bitter.
We will be as mean as the Germans!

728
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:27,850
They hurt?
That `s nothing. Scratch.

729
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:33,000
Thank you, younger sergeant.
For what?

730
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
In the second you gave me
to change the magazine.

731
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:42,530
From that moment to the grave cover
we will ride five together.

732
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Comrade Sergeant, are you a communist?
Yes, what?

733
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Please become president
our Komsomo meeting.

734
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
What meeting? For what?

735
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,720
Cowardice.

736
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Begging...

737
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,600
That's good.

738
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,610
It's great...
Begging...

739
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,000
So let's not delay.

740
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,930
We will judge companion.
We'll make a protocol ... Yes?

741
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And then Germany, our protocol
approved their resolution.

742
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Therefore, as a sergeant
and as a communist ...

743
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I cancel all meetings at this time.
Is it clear?

744
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,970
As for cowardice -
it wasn't him.

745
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Cowardice only in the second fight
going out, girls.

746
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,000
And this is a mistake, a lack of experience ...

747
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,130
Right, Soldier Czetwiertak?

748
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,930
That's right ...

749
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
So I order you to wipe your nose and tears.

750
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
But using ours
stop, girls ...

751
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Germany will not wait.
I can escape to the forest, look for them there ...

752
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
And that means we have to get on their tail ...

753
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
To recognize the situation.

754
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,300
War is not only about who will shoot whom,
but who will outsmart whom.

755
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,890
Wait here.

756
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,970
Shot in the back by his own.

757
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,890
They finished off the wounded.

758
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,960
You see, they have such a right.

759
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:04,530
Let's count ...

760
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
We took care of two there, Gala.

761
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,850
Two here. Should stay 12.

762
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,690
And it's not scary for us anymore
it's a trifle.

763
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,310
Comrade Sergeant!

764
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,880
- Fedot Yevgraficz!
- Comrade Sergeant!

765
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
What are you girls ...

766
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,380
Easy easy...

767
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,680
sucks your sister sisters ...

768
01:27:58,230 --> 01:28:01,000
Five heroines like brothers.

769
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,380
Tell Fiedot ...

770
01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:19,730
And Gala?

771
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:28,030
Our comrades have fallen ...

772
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:31,000
Death of the brave ...

773
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Quadruple in a shootout.

774
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,920
Lisa Briczkina drowned in the swamp.

775
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,460
So together with Sonia,
We've already lost three ...

776
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:47,230
This is what it looks like.

777
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:55,000
For this price, we delayed the whole day
enemy from the lake. Day!

778
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,000
There is nothing here ...
Have you lost something?

779
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,880
The igniter has no ...
You were unnecessarily removed ...

780
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Without a fuse, a grenade is a piece of iron.

781
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
So we were left without artillery, girls ...
it's Nothing, Comrade Sergeant.

782
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,960
We'll manage!

783
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:36,060
Hear me, comrades soldiers,
my order.

784
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,160
Wrєg, armed to the teeth,
is heading in our direction.

785
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:46,000
There are no neighbors on the right,
on the left also.

786
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Therefore I command all soldiers ...

787
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,920
And hold the front personally!

788
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Hold on to the last drop of blood!

789
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,020
Because there is Russia behind our backs ...

790
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,730
And this is simply our homeland!

791
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,520
There will be no help.
We have to come here bh ...

792
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:15,830
Probably the last ...

793
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,500
Here come! To the positions!

794
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,530
The sun ...

795
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,330
Give me the bandages!
Bandages to make the blood of the village ...

796
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:46,700
There is no.
Cholera...

797
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,350
GoЯ ...

798
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:15,060
Rita, it's nothing like that.
The shard passed right through.

799
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,470
Hey you guys!

800
01:34:25,730 --> 01:34:27,700
Run away ...

801
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,560
chasing them to the forest ...

802
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,420
Reptiles ...

803
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:03,630
Hello...

804
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,300
Reptiles!

805
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:42,850
penia ... immediately ... she died?

806
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,970
There are no backpacks, no rifles ...

807
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,680
They took with them or hid ...

808
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,400
But they didn't beat us, you understand ?!

809
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:04,960
I'm still alive
I need to be knocked down yet!

810
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,680
Hurts?
Nothing hurts me.

811
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,300
Here it hurts ...
There's a wound here, Rita.

812
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,130
Yes, my dear...

813
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,630
I consecrated you.

814
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,300
I sacrificed all five.

815
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:29,330
for what? For ten Fryce?
Why so?

816
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:35,060
Everything is clear - There is a war.
It is known - war, of course ...

817
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,680
And then, how will there be peace?

818
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:43,230
It will be clear why you have come to perish?

819
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:46,900
Why didn't I let Frycom take over?
Why did I make a decision too?

820
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:50,000
What to say, Rita?

821
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:56,000
When they ask why our boys
did they not protect their mothers from the bullets?

822
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,130
Why are you married to Death,
and themselves alive and healthy? ...

823
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:05,000
We wanted to protect the Kirov bus
Bie│omorskie canal!

824
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:10,000
And there's security there too,
more people than five girls ...

825
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,600
- ... and a sergeant with a gun.
There's no need to...

826
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:16,000
Motherland Mother ...

827
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,960
It was for her ...

828
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,190
And we protected her.

829
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
First of all her.

830
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,890
And then the channels ...

831
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,260
My last request.

832
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:40,000
Will you fill it?

833
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,430
Take, two bullets left.

834
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,140
Be calmer.

835
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,140
And I'll go and look around.

836
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:08,260
I'll be back by evening.

837
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:11,260
And at night we will get to our own people.

838
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,520
Do you remember when I met Germans ...

839
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,570
I run to my mother, to the city ...
I have a son there.

840
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
One and a half years old, Alik ...

841
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,770
Albert, her name is.

842
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
My mom is very ill...

843
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,520
Don't worry, Rita.
I understood everything.

844
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,770
Kiss me ...

845
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,500
You are ...

846
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,470
Come on ...

847
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,730
On the groundъ! Everyone on the groundъ!

848
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,800
What? Have you defeated us? Yes?!

849
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Five girls ...

850
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:04,000
There were five girls, there were only five!
And you didn't pass!

851
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:08,100
You didn't get anywhere,
and you will die here!

852
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:10,860
You will all die!

853
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:14,630
Personally, kill everyone!

854
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:20,560
Even if the command doesn't forgive,
and then judge me ...

855
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:24,160
Let me judge!

856
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:24,960
WeЯ ...

857
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Comrade Sergeant ...

858
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,760
Comrade Sergeant!
Fedot Yevgrafich ...

859
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:41,430
They brought a supplement.

860
01:46:18,430 --> 01:46:19,830
PIOTR FIODOROW

861
01:46:20,930 --> 01:46:23,230
ANASTASIJA MIKULCHINA

862
01:46:25,130 --> 01:46:27,030
JEWGIENIA MAGAACHOWA
