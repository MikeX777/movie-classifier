1
00:00:28,096 --> 00:00:30,664
* spoke to me

2
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,701
* I can't believe it,
but she spoke to me *

3
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:34,802
I'm Josh.

4
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,670
How are you
this evening?

5
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,506
* close to me

6
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:42,076
* I never thought
I'd get her close to me *

7
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,345
[Woman]
Don't be shy. All
my friends are...

8
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:50,184
* now the moon and the sun
belong to me *

9
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:58,692
* all my wildest hopes,
my crazy dreams *

10
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,661
[Man]
They seem more
like reality.

11
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,230
* fantasy

12
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:05,433
* this girl fulfills
my every fantasy *

13
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,436
Loving from a man.

14
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,438
* she must be

15
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:14,408
* specially designed
by heaven just for me *

16
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:16,577
* just for me

17
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:22,683
* friends that gather,
they see mystery *

18
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:31,292
* I look at her,
and I see a masterpiece *

19
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,862
* she spoke to me

20
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:39,633
* I can't believe it,
but she spoke to me *

21
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,336
* spoke to me

22
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,774
* I can't believe it,
but she spoke to me *

23
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:51,145
* if she hurts me

24
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:54,648
* I'll take it all
with open arms, you see *

25
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,790
* 'cause like a track
under a subway train *

26
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,628
* she could roll
all over me *

27
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,831
* and I'd still
feel the same *

28
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:14,435
* 'cause today is the day
she spoke to me *

29
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:18,672
* I can't believe it,
but she spoke to me *

30
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:23,411
* close to me

31
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:26,647
* I never thought
I'd get her close to me *

32
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,921
[Woman]
I'm stuck in some
groovy wet dream.

33
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,624
* ooh ooh

34
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,395
[Man]
I'm digging the scene.

35
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,399
* yeah, baby

36
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:48,302
[Woman whispering]
Oh, yeah.
That was so nice.

37
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,238
* 1, 2

38
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:52,840
* 1, 2, 3, unh

39
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,442
[Man]
O.K., begin.

40
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:57,811
The only reason I have
consented to doing this

41
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,814
Is because I wish
to clear to my name.

42
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,417
Not that I care
what people think,

43
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:04,818
But enough is enough.

44
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,454
Hold on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

45
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:07,755
Hold on a minute.

46
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,591
Yeah, well, can I finish
my monologue, please?

47
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,327
We're looking for
the latest and the hottest.

48
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,928
O.K.?

49
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:18,566
You know, we're looking for
the beauty of Halle Berry,

50
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,568
The sexiness
of jada pinkett,

51
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,603
The... the soaring voice
of Whitney.

52
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,004
Can you sing?

53
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,606
Yes, I can.

54
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,707
Don't talk.

55
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,841
Listen.

56
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,510
O.K.

57
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,979
We're looking for the range
of Angela bassett.

58
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,748
We're looking
for the total game.

59
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:35,716
You know what I'm saying?

60
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,285
Yeah.

61
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,753
O.K. This thing... this movie
is going to be big.

62
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:41,522
Bigger than big.
Huge.

63
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:45,893
The greatest romantic
African-American film
ever made,

64
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,895
Directed by me,
of course,

65
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:50,498
Told from
the point of view

66
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,400
Of an African-American
woman.

67
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,736
We got Denzel, Wesley,
fish.

68
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,971
They're all signed up
to play supporting roles.

69
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,340
What we need...

70
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,475
What are you
looking at?

71
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,377
Because when you said
their names as supporting...

72
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:04,378
Don't talk.

73
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:05,513
Listen.

74
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,914
O.K.

75
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,650
Now, this total package
that I'm looking for,

76
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,620
We know... i know...

77
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:13,921
She's out there.

78
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,957
And I'll know her
when I see her.

79
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,559
Now you can talk.

80
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,960
Thank you.

81
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,029
Ooh, let's see,
where do I start?

82
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,797
Um...

83
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,766
I've been studying
for several years.

84
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,368
I went to nyu.

85
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,303
Mm-hmm.

86
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:30,471
Done a little off-Broadway,

87
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:31,872
A little episodic
television.

88
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,541
I can sing,
I can dance,

89
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,709
And I can act,
so if you pick me,

90
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,345
You can't go wrong.

91
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:40,348
Let me stop being shy.
I just need a break.

92
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:41,815
A break. That's
what I need, a break.

93
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,851
So, if you let me
finish my monologue,

94
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,387
Then I can do the sides...
Not now.

95
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,422
But I'd read
the sides after.

96
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:49,823
First things first.

97
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,325
Um, stand up.

98
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,660
Okey-dokey.

99
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:53,794
O.K.

100
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:57,097
Hug the camera.

101
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,767
I want you
to turn around.

102
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,369
Uh, wrong way.

103
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,503
Oops. Sorry.

104
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,605
Yeah. That's it.

105
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,007
Slowly.

106
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,010
And slowly.

107
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,380
Keep it turning.

108
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:16,584
The person we're looking for
needs to ooze sexuality.

109
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,420
Very good.
Bravo, bravo.

110
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,554
You may sit
right back down.

111
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,423
All right.

112
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,725
O.K., now if you would just,
uh, unbutton your blouse

113
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,760
So we can see
your breasts.

114
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:27,861
What?

115
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,431
Could you unbutton
your blouse

116
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,699
So we can see
your breasts?

117
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,667
Is that required
of the role?

118
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,002
I mean, nobody told me

119
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,504
I was going to have
to take my top off.

120
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:37,905
Didn't Murray
tell you that?

121
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,908
No, he did not
tell me that.

122
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,543
Well, he fuckin'
should've.

123
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:43,644
O.K., look.

124
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,679
This is kind
of embarrassing.

125
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,615
O.K., um...

126
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,617
Yes, it's required
of the role.

127
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,985
It's a major part
of the role.

128
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,554
All right, and, uh...

129
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:56,490
We're not trying
to be weird here,

130
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:59,159
But we're just
professionals.

131
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,728
Hey, you know what?

132
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,129
I have a picture.
I can go get it

133
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,731
At the house
and bring it back...

134
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:04,832
This topless
little number...

135
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,534
Whoa. Hold it.
Whoa, whoa.

136
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,937
We got 75 fuckin'
other girls to see
here, o.K.?

137
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,573
I'm sorry.
I don't mean
to be abusive,

138
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:13,974
But what's it
going to be?

139
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,144
Can you do it or not?

140
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,046
Come on, honey.
We don't have time.

141
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,181
Just take
your clothes off.

142
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,485
All right, all right.
It's cool. It's cool.
Everything's cool.

143
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,020
* they turn me on

144
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,492
* I don't care
where we go *

145
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:32,693
Yeah.

146
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,194
* I don't care
what we do *

147
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,162
Yeah, that's it.

148
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:38,065
* I don't care

149
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,000
That's great.

150
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,636
* just take me with you

151
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,737
O.K. Now, freeze.

152
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,172
Don't move.
Don't talk.

153
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,774
I can't do this.

154
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,175
You can't do this?

155
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,743
You can't do what?

156
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:52,179
What the hell's
going on here?

157
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,747
What is happening?

158
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,082
[Assistant]
I'm sorry.

159
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:58,118
I mean, where do you
find these girls?

160
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,587
Hey, look, come here.

161
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,954
Aw, shit!

162
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:03,223
* I don't care
where we go *

163
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,026
* I don't care
what we do *

164
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,595
Let her go!

165
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:09,863
Bring the next actress
in here.

166
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,465
She better fucking know
what she is getting into.

167
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,066
Then get me
a fucking cup of coffee!

168
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,234
What in the fuck
is your problem?

169
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,036
Why didn't you
tell me?

170
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,605
If I would've told you,
you would've never went.

171
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:18,972
How did it go,
knock 'em dead?

172
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:22,009
I have never
been so humiliated
in all my life!

173
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,877
Cut the sturm and drang.

174
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:26,113
You want to be
an actress, a star,
you showed them your tits!

175
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,749
So what!
Big fucking deal,
all right?

176
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,017
Sharon stone
spread her legs,

177
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,885
And look what happened.

178
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,821
When I saw that,
I said to myself,
"that's a star."

179
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,656

* housequake

373
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:56,129
* housequake

374
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:57,530
Hey there, sexy,

375
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,099
You've just reached

376
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,701
The hottest
live talk line around...

377
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,570
970-wow!

378
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:07,174

379
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:10,610
The cost of this call
is $1.95 a minute,

380
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,579
Plus a $5.00 connection fee.

381
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,581
Specialty calls
are priced accordingly.

382
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,549
Hi. I'm here
for an appointment.

383
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,986
[Woman]
If you don't want
to play with me...

384
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,587
That's o.K.

385
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,723
Or you're under the age
of 18, please hang up now,

386
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,558
But if you're ready,
willing, and able,

387
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,294
Stay on the line

388
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:31,631
And get your hands on
the fantasy girl
of your dreams.

389
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,633
Hi. Have you
called here before?

390
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,635
Can I have
your name?

391
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,604
The next time
you call in,

392
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,640
All you need
is your phone number
and four-digit i.D.

393
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,242
Excuse me.
I'm here...

394
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,244
All right. I'm going
to hook you up

395
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,279
To one of our
lovely ladies now.

396
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,680
O.K. Hold the line.

397
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:48,982
I'm sorry.

398
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:50,984
Uh, I have
an appointment,

399
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:53,020
And I don't know
which direction to...

400
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,421
Oh, I'll take you.

401
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,123
Come on.

402
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,730
Lil?

403
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,065
Hmm?

404
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,433
Your appointment's here.

405
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,035
[Woman]
Bend over!

406
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,070
Hi. Come on in
and sit down, baby.

407
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,438
How you doing?

408
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,073
I'm just fine,
thank you.

409
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,207
How you doing?

410
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,342
I'm good.

411
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,476
I hear this is a place

412
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,245
Where a girl can make
lots of cash.

413
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,479
You over 18?

414
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:20,680
Of course I am.

415
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,715
A young voice.
That's good.

416
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,284
You're not local.

417
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,419
I'm from queens,
born and raised.

418
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:29,089
And you're an actress?

419
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,557
[Laughing]

420
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,192
Yes, ma'am,
I'm an actress.

421
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:35,462
It's good work,
when I can find it.

422
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,464
"That falling feeling."

423
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,399
Hmm.

424
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,034
How many letters
is it?

425
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,169
Seven.

426
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,204
That falling feeling.

427
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,539
Um...

428
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,108
That's vertigo.

429
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:52,145
All right.

430
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,381
That works.

431
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,317
You like men?

432
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,551
Yes, I love men.

433
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:00,120
My luck's for shit
with them,

434
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,521
But I love them.

435
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,090
So I said to myself,

436
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:05,058
If you can't get it
in real life,

437
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,527
You might as well
get it on the job.
Right?

438
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,129
Right.

439
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,530
You're a dominatrix.

440
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:11,731
Dominatrix?

441
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,366
Dominatrix.
Finish it.

442
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,302
Uh...

443
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:18,605
I would probably
have...

444
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:19,606
Blond hair.

445
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,141
Long blond hair,

446
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,543
Uh...

447
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,578
38 cs...

448
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,780
Yeah, I'd have some
nice, healthy jugs

449
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:30,483
With big,
perky nipples.

450
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:31,851
There.

451
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,487
All right. Come on.
That's good.

452
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,289
Very good.

453
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:37,724
Can't promise you
anything,

454
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,626
But I'll put in
a good word, o.K.?

455
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:40,727
Yes.

456
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,362
Keep your fingers
crossed.

457
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,363
Thank you.

458
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,797
All right.

459
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,399
Speak into this.

460
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:47,734
What do you want me
to say?

461
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,303
A fantasy chat.

462
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,172
Go ahead.
The tape is rolling.

463
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,306
O.K.

464
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,441
Um...

465
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:55,742
Hi there.

466
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,378
I'm so happy
that you called.

467
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,448
Um, what's your name?

468
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,683
Mike! Oh, hi, Mike.

469
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,352
Do you want to play?

470
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,187
That's great.
That's great.

471
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,521
Thanks.

472
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,123
Yeah, yeah. We'll
give this a listen

473
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:11,424
And let
you know, huh?

474
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,361
Are you interested
in any peep show
stuff?

475
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:15,462
Peep show?

476
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:18,265
You sex them up
on the phone.

477
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:19,666
Here's your coffee.

478
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,201
Yeah, thanks.

479
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,569
Good luck, honey.

480
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,537
They get to watch you
jiggle.

481
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,339
I mean, there's no
physical contact
whatsoever.

482
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,707
Mm-hmm.

483
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,809
There's a little, uh,
a little nudity.

484
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,811
But the money's
a lot better.

485
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,813
Listen. Believe me
when I tell you
something.

486
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,748
This is nice,
clean work.

487
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,184
No, thank you.
No. No.

488
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,718
You ever married?

489
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:41,554
Yeah, uh, but it's over.

490
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,156
Oh, I'm sorry.

491
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,457
No, no, really.

492
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:45,625
You don't have
to be sorry.

493
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:46,859
See, he was
a kleptomaniac.

494
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,461
On top of that,
he was weird,

495
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,829
But I don't want
to talk about that.

496
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,865
Any experience?
No experience,
right?

497
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,434
Right.

498
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,802
We have
a training session.

499
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,370
We could
show you the ropes.

500
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:58,805
I mean,
it's not a problem.

501
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,740
We're going to be seeing
a lot of ladies.

502
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,675
I don't think
that this is for me,

503
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,944
This kind of stuff.
The peep show thing.

504
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,879
All right, all right.
Suit yourself.

505
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,948
Something comes up,
I'll give you a ring.

506
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,217
O.K.
Nice meeting you.

507
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,384
Take care.

508
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:14,621
So you, um,
you own this place?

509
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,623
Yeah.
You like it?

510
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,759
Oh, yes, it's...
It's lovely.

511
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,862
So, every girl
works a shift.

512
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,365
You've got three shifts
to choose from.

513
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,600
You choose the one
that suits you best.

514
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,337
Some shifts are busier
than others.

515
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,339
You get paid
by the call.

516
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,773
Bonus if a guy
requests you.

517
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,975
Can I hold your puppy.
Hi, little pup-pup.

518
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,578
Guys call us up,
and they tell us
what they want.

519
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,579
You dig?

520
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,680
I dig.

521
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,250
Toilet training,
bestiality,

522
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,918
Foot fetishes,
butt plugs,

523
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:49,589
Bisexuality, three-ways,
five-ways, six-ways,

524
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:50,990
Yadda yadda yadda.

525
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,325
Yadda yadda yadda.

526
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,560
The mistress-slave routine.

527
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,295
¿Comprende?

528
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:58,531
Comprende.
You know what?
I can do this.

529
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:02,769
Mm-hmm.
I can see myself
just working it.

530
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,804
Can I ask you
a personal question?

531
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:05,938
Sure.

532
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,374
Is your clit pierced?

533
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,441
Nope. Nope.

534
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:09,809
Ah, never mind.

535
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,444
Anyway, shitting's
really big right now.

536
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:12,779
Don't ask me why.

537
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,914
Could be the stock market.
I don't know.

538
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,949
They pay by charge card.

539
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:20,019
They call us, we call you,
you call them,

540
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,855
And you chat until...

I'm on your lap,

899
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,408
And I'm bouncing
my titties
up and down.

900
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,676
These teats
are moving up
and down, Stephen.

901
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,347
Ohh, ohh!

902
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,616
Oooohh!
Ahhhhhh!

903
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:55,321
Oh, you are a gift
on this earth.

904
00:35:55,354 --> 00:36:00,226
Ah-ha, thanks, honey.

905

[Hangs up phone]

906
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,529
Girl 6.

907
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:07,466
Congratulations.

908
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,934
Thank you. I mean,
he just came.

909
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:12,704
His name was Stephen,
and he just... ahh!

910
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:14,673
He hung up happy.
Good job.

911
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:15,941
Now how you feel?

912
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,809
Fine. My mouth's
a little...

913
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:20,412
All right, here.
Have some soda.

914
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:23,549
All right.

915
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,417
Now, miss girl 6,

Voila.

918
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:30,822
Ohh.

919
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,858
You broke your cherry.

920
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:38,230
All right, all right.
Come on, y'all.
Back to work.

921
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:40,766
There we go.
Congratulations, baby.

922
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,274
He came.

923
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:55,281
[Woman]
Oh, yes, Dr. farber.

924
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:57,816
I love it
when you put me
in those stirrups

925
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:01,287
And examine me
with your speculum.

926
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:04,390
Oh, yes.

927
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:06,958
[Woman]
Big girl, big pussy.

928
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:09,361
Slim girl, all pussy.

[Beeping]

930
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,804
Hi there.

931
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,539
Hi there.

932
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,874
I'm so glad
you called.

933
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,477
I'm calling from
my beach house,
housewife.

934
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:27,579
Let's start
in the kitchen.

935
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:29,915
There's whipped cream
in the refrigerator.

936
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:32,918
I've been
on my feet all day,

937
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:35,721
And now I'm on
my hands and knees

938
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,323
Cleaning
the kitchen floor.

939
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:39,625
I sure would like
to take a break

940
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:41,593
So I can talk to you.

941
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:42,994
You're scrubbing
the floor?

942
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,596
Mm-hmm.

943
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,598
Don't stop
scrubbing.

944
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:50,035
If you don't mind,
we'll talk while you work.

945
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:54,873
I'm making slow,
soapy circles

946
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:57,843
On the linoleum
with my scrub brush.

947
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:59,378
What color's
the linoleum?

948
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:00,746
Yellow.

949
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:05,784
It's yellow
with little daisies.

950
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:10,356
Slow, soapy circles

951
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:13,725
On my hands and knees.

952
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,494
Where are your kids?

953
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,629
They're taking their naps.

954
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:20,065
I'm pushing
your dress up
from behind.

955
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:21,767
I'm going to
mount you

956
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,503
Snoopy-doggy-
dog-style,
housewife.

957
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:25,671
Ohh.

958
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:26,972
Don't stop
scrubbing.

959
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,440
Uh-uh.

960
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:29,975
I'm mounting you
now, housewife.

961
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:32,378
Got a lot of work
to do.

962
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:33,745
Don't stop
scrubbing.

[Moaning]

964
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,748
Don't stop
scrubbing.

965
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,685
A woman's work
is never done.

966
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:44,523
Oh, you're so right.
I hate that grimy buildup.

967
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:48,527
With no bra on,
you know?

968
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,996
I go shopping
at the a&p like that.

969
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,598
I'd be the
stock boy,

970
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:55,033
And I would grab
your p-p-produce.

971
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,101
Mm-hmm.

972
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:58,937
I went shopping
yesterday.

973
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,539
What did you buy?

974
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,773
Soup.

975
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,910
Asparagus...

976
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:06,912
Oyster crackers,
you know?

977
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,079
For the soup.

978
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:09,715
For the soup.

979
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,883
Did you get
lamb chops?

980
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:14,019
With mint jelly.

981
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,020

988
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,828
Instant oatmeal.

989
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,696
Whew,
instant oatmeal?

990
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,764
Quick grits.

991
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:27,966
Quick... quick
grits?

Hi.

1001
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,617
Who am I
speaking with?

1002
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:46,952
Who am I
speaking with?

1003
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:47,953
This is lovely.

Wait. Lesley
or lovely.

Hi, lovely.
Hi.

1009
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,526
My name is Bob.
Bob?

1010
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,527
Yeah.

1011
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:56,662
Where you calling
from, Bob?

1012
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:58,497
I'm calling
from Tucson.

1013
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,631
Tucson?

1014
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:01,166
You know where that is?

1015
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,669
Yeah. Is it, uh...
what's it like
down there?

1016
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:04,970
Dry heat.

1017
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:07,205
Dry heat. Mmm.

1018
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,476
I was just, um,
wondering if,

1019
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:14,613
You know, is, uh
is... is there a rule,

1020
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,515
Like, does it
have to be a sex talk?

1021
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:18,717
Oh, no, no, no, Bob.

1022
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,085
It's whatever
you like.

1023
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,753
We can talk
about anything.

1024
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:23,154
We can talk...
Anything?

1025
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:25,691
Anything.
I'm here for you.

1026
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:29,027
Feeling like talking
about my mother, actually.

1027
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,129
What's your
mother's name?

1028
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:34,533
My mom, uh,
her name is Ruth.

1029
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:35,534
Ruth?

1030
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:37,803
And, uh, the thing...

1031
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:42,007
My mother's dying of...
She's dying of cancer now,

1032
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,209
And, uh, I just
wanted to hear...

1033
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:48,847
I wanted to say that
to hear how that sounded.

1034
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,782
Is your mother alive still?

1035
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:52,250
Yes, she is.

1036
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,686
Do you tell her
that you love her?

1037
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,254
Yeah. I tell her
I love her.

1038
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:00,926
I never, um, I never use
those words with my parents.

1039
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,594
That's the thing.

1040
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:05,063
I never said
"I love you" to her,

1041
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:06,565
And I'm agonizing now.

1042
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:07,933
What do you think?

1043
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,035
Well, you know, Bob,
life is about
choices,

1044
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:12,671
And I think that
whatever choice
you decide to make

1045
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,005
Will be
the right choice.

1046
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,241
I'm out here,
and I'm thinking,

1047
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:17,743
And I just, uh,

1048
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:20,045
I just really
needed to talk,

1049
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:22,814
And I'm glad...
I'm really glad that, uh,

1050
00:41:22,848 --> 00:41:24,182
That I dialed
your number.

1051
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,885
I'm glad you dialed
my number as well.

1052
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:28,253
You doing all right?

1053
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,288
I got my first
request tonight.

1054
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,257
Yeah? Congratulations.

1055
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,860
I'm sure it won't
be your last.

1056
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:37,262
You need to give yourself
an activity of some sort...

1057
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,864
A magazine,
a book, something,

1058
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,866
Or you're going to
get hooked, girl.

1059
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:42,300
No.
I'm concentrating.

1060
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,301
Concentrating?

1061
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,269
Mm-hmm.

1062
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:48,774
Well, you coming
with them?

1063
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:49,975
Please.

1064
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,577
You sure about that?

1065
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,744
I'm positive.

1066
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:54,746
All right.
I got to go.

1067
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,114
Take it easy,
all right?

1068
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:57,783
Later.

1069
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:06,224
How much are grapes?

1070
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,760
I'll take a pound
of your grapes.

1071
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:09,761
$3.00.

1072
00:42:09,795 --> 00:42:10,896
$3.00?

1073
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:12,163
Bet.

1074
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,070
One month down,
three to go.

1075
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:23,675
How much longer are
you going to do this
phone bone stuff?

1076
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:26,244
Well, to be
perfectly honest,
Jimmy, I don't know.

1077
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,013
You don't know?

1078
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,981
I don't know, 'cause
I'm starting to like it.

1079
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,216
Like it?

1080
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:32,718
Yeah. My endurance
has picked up,

1081
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:33,985
And I've become
extremely popular.

1082
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:35,587
You like this stuff,
huh?

1083
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:38,089
It's a lot of fun.

1084
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:40,992
My boss lil says
she ain't never seen
nothing like it.

1085
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:43,194
We had 38 phone calls
last night.

1086
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:46,865
17 requests
were for moi.

1087
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,100
17 guys
requested you?

1088
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:52,604
Yeah. That's, like,
what, 50%, right?

1089
00:42:52,638 --> 00:42:54,706
They wanted me.

1090
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,174
I don't know.

1091
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,644
Look at you
eating your food.

1092
00:42:58,677 --> 00:42:59,911
You haven't
blessed it.

1093
00:42:59,945 --> 00:43:01,179
I'm hungry.

1094
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:02,648
I know, but let's
make a toast.

1095
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:04,082
I'm excited
about this.

1096
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:05,083
All right.

1097
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:06,685
To phone bone.

1098
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:09,655
Phone bone.

1099
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:10,922
Mmm.

1100
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:14,893
Amen.

1101
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,895
He needed me
real bad, too.

1102
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,630
I was mistress April.

1103
00:43:18,664 --> 00:43:20,632
This guy was
really into pain.

1104
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,400
He wanted me
to keep counting

1105
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:26,037
As he plucked
his pubic hairs out
one by one

1106
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:27,639
With a monkey wrench.

1107
00:43:27,673 --> 00:43:29,040
With
a monkey wrench?

1108
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:30,241
A monkey wrench.

1109
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:31,643
What happened
to tweezers?

1110
00:43:31,677 --> 00:43:32,978
I could just
picture that.

1111
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:34,780
1, ow!

1112
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:37,182
2, ow! Ow!

1113
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:39,785
3, ouch!

1114
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:42,821
4, it hurts
so good.

1115
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:44,222
Come on.
That's sick.

1116
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,423
That's not sick.
It's sick.

1117
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,992
The man got off.

1118
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:48,259
It's still
sick anyway.

1119
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:50,095
Plus I got my minutes.

1120
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,130
Three requests
because he had to
call back three times.

1121
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:53,965
I'm telling you,
he needed it bad.

1122
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:58,003
Ooh, a pilot called...

1123
00:43:58,036 --> 00:43:59,805
From a cockpit.

1124
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:01,372
Cockpit fuck fantasy,

1125
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:03,709
33,000 feet
in the air

1126
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:07,045
With brigitte,
my busty blonde.

1127
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:09,681
A pilot called you
from his cockpit?

1128
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:10,982
Mm-hmm.

1129
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:12,951
No wonder planes
be falling

1130
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:16,121
Out of the sky
left and right.

1131
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,723
You want
some more wine?

1132
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:19,124
No.
That's all right.

1133
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,726
Come on, Jimmy.
No, come on, baby.

1134
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:23,895
That's all right.
That's all right.

1135
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:26,397
Oh, you remember
Bob from Tucson?

1136
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:28,199
Bob regular?

1137
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:30,135
Yeah, yeah. Well,
we're vibing, right?

1138
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:33,138
He loves to talk to me
about his mother.

1139
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,006
When was the last time
you had an audition?

1140
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,442
He likes to talk to me
about his mother

1141
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:39,010
Because she's got cancer

1142
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:40,211
And they were
never really close.

1143
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:43,114
Now they seem to be
torn, you know?

1144
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:46,151
So, what does
this have to do with
your acting career?

1145
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,485
What happened
to that?

1146
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,120
I'm still an actress, Jimmy.

1147
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:51,489
How are you acting?
What?

1148
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,925
How are you acting?
You're not on stage,
not on camera.

1149
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:56,728
You're on the phone.
How are you acting,
talking on the phone?

1150
00:44:56,762 --> 00:44:59,497
It is acting.
Some perverts,
how's that acting?

1151
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,099
They're not perverts,
Jimmy, o.K.?

1152
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:02,500
They're normal
people, right?

1153
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,937
Baby, let me
tell you something.

1154
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:09,374
You can continue
to live in that
little fantasy world

1155
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:11,977
With the baseball cards
and the autograph bullshit,

1156
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,378
Whatever the fuck
it is you do.

1157
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:17,282
But me, I got to eat,
and I got to pay my rent.

1158
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:19,818
Phone sex is acting.

1159
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:22,520
Now, if you don't
like it,

1160
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,390
You can step.
Fuck you.

1161
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:26,958
I got Willie mays'
and Hank Aaron's
autograph

1162
00:45:26,992 --> 00:45:28,326
On a baseball card.

1163
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,328
They're in
the hall of fame.

1164
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:32,798
Is there a phone sex
hall of fame?

1165
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:35,000
Is there
an equivalent
of cooperstown

1166
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:37,435
For the phone sex
hall of fame?

1167
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,337
You bugging.
You drank too much.

1168
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,006
You're trippin'.

1169
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:43,474
You wish you had
hammerin' Hank's
autograph.

1170
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:46,477
That's a goddamn lie.
I wouldn't be able
to pay my rent.

1171
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:48,914
Phone sex
is where I am.

1172
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:51,482
I'm paying my bills.
It's an investment.

1173
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:55,153
I'm not going
to sell while
it's short money.

1174
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:58,123
I'll sell them
for more
in the long haul.

1175
00:45:58,156 --> 00:46:01,092
Get a life, man.
I ain't paying your rent.

1176
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:04,129
What the fuck is
somebody pulling
out pubic hair

1177
00:46:04,162 --> 00:46:05,530
With a fucking
monkey wrench?

1178
00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:07,532
It doesn't matter.
It's paying me.

1179
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:10,535
I'll hop my ass on a plane,
go to Hollywood,
and live out my dreams.

1180
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:12,137
What'll you do?
You're going to
collect autographs

1181
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,372
And take the next person
that moves in

1182
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:16,141
And make them
pay your rent.

1183
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:19,544
Springtime is usually
that time of the year

1184
00:46:19,577 --> 00:46:22,848
When children are outdoors
enjoying their young lives.

1185
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:25,450
Sometimes, however,
joy is not what they get.

1186
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:27,052
Carol.

1187
00:46:27,085 --> 00:46:28,954
In Harlem tonight,
there is tragedy.

1188
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:32,457
After-school play
has turned into
a most deadly game.

1189
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,592
Nita Hicks
is on the scene.

1190
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,894
Nita.

1191
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:37,195
Thank you, Carol.

1192
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:39,564
It started out as
an after-school game

1193
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:41,132
Between two little girls

1194
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:43,201
In this high-rise
apartment building

1195
00:46:43,234 --> 00:46:45,103
At 1470 Amsterdam Avenue.

1196
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:48,073
What started out as a game
has played itself out

1197
00:46:48,106 --> 00:46:49,540
Into a family's
worst nightmare.

1198
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:52,343
It all started in this
hallway at this door

1199
00:46:52,377 --> 00:46:55,013
That the girls' game of tag
led to tragedy.

1200
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:57,883
Witnesses are telling us
that 8-year-old Angela king

1201
00:46:57,916 --> 00:46:59,550
Was running down
the sixth-floor hallway

1202
00:46:59,584 --> 00:47:02,220
When she leaned
against this elevator door.

1203
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:04,622
The elevator, however,
was not on the sixth floor.

1204
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,292
In fact, it was up
on the 18th floor.

1205
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,494
And that elevator door
should have been secure.

1206
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:11,596
It was not.
It gave way.

1207
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:13,498
8-year-old Angela king

1208
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,500
Fell through the empty
elevator shaft,

1209
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:18,436
Falling six floors
down into the basement.

1210
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:20,438
Angela was rushed
to Harlem hospital,

1211
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:22,440
But officials
are telling me now

1212
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:24,309
That she has been
transferred

1213
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,911
To Manhattan's
mount sinai.

1214
00:47:25,944 --> 00:47:27,312
The little girl
is suffering

1215
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,914
From multiple
skull fractures.

1216
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:30,315
She is in
intensive care.

1217
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,317
She is listed
in critical condition.

1218
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,320
Right now, I'm in the home
of Martha may Jones,

1219
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,055
Who is Angela's aunt.

1220
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:40,425
Yes. I'm her
mother's sister.

1221
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,327
I don't know.

1222
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,930
Her mama's
at the hospital
with her now.

1223
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:47,365
She's a good
little girl.

1224
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:49,167
She was good
in school.

1225
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,635
She did her work.

1226
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:54,172
She always had
a nice smile
on her face.

1227
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,407
[Girls laughing]

1228
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:03,148
O.K., o.K., well...

1229
00:48:03,181 --> 00:48:05,350
Christine and Martin,
have things been any hotter

1230
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,985
Since you guys called
last week?

1231
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:08,987
Sheila, it's so good
to hear your voice.

1232
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:12,357
Listen, Sheila,
I want to live
my fantasy one time

1233
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,225
Of a menage a trois

1234
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:17,128
With Christine
and your friend Rosita.

1235
00:48:17,162 --> 00:48:18,129
Rosita?

1236
00:48:18,163 --> 00:48:19,497
I can't believe him.

1237
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,132
That's my best
friend, Sheila.

1238
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:22,500
I don't believe you.

1239
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:25,103
Martin and Christine,
we go through this

1240
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:27,105
With you guys
every week, o.K.?

1241
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:29,107
Now, tonight,
let's try to have

1242
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,110
A really
hot sexual experience.

1243
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:34,145
Well, why does
he have to have
another woman?

1244
00:48:34,179 --> 00:48:35,313
Right. Right.

1245
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:36,547
He doesn't
really love me.

1246
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:38,149
I love you.

1247
00:48:38,183 --> 00:48:40,051
No, you don't.
That's not love.

1248
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:42,153
Listen. What's wrong?
You don't know
what love is.

1249
00:48:42,187 --> 00:48:45,556
What's wrong for a man
wanting his wife
and his wife's friend

1250
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,159
To lick his dick
at the same time?

1251
00:48:48,193 --> 00:48:49,694
Oh, that's
what you want?

1252
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:54,465
How would you like it
if julio was
licking me, huh?

1253
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:57,268
Julio?
Yeah, julio. And besides,
he's my friend,

1254
00:48:57,302 --> 00:49:00,238
And I talk to him.
And he says that's
not normal, all right?

1255
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,040
[Speaking spanish]

1256
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:04,075
If you do it
with me,

1257
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:05,443
I do it with him.

1258
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:07,012
Oh, do you want julio?

1259
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:09,447
Why don't we get
julio in on this?

1260
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,715
[Man]
I got rolexes

1261
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:12,217
Coming out my ass,
all right?

1262
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,484
You make me come,
I'll buy you a rolex.

1263
00:49:13,518 --> 00:49:15,086
That's worth a rolex.

1264
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,155
That's worth me coming.

1265
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:20,191
Now, Martin, I want you to
talk to her really gently.

1266
00:49:20,225 --> 00:49:21,559
Soothe her, coax her.

1267
00:49:21,592 --> 00:49:23,561
She's your wife.
You love her.

1268
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,763
He doesn't
know how to soothe
or coax nobody

1269
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,433
Because
he likes it hard
all the time.

1270
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:29,600
That's his problem.

1271
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:31,202
He's always rough
with me.

1272
00:49:31,236 --> 00:49:32,503
She's so frigid,
Sheila.

1273
00:49:32,537 --> 00:49:33,738
She's so ice cold.

1274
00:49:33,771 --> 00:49:35,240
Don't say that.
I am not cold.

1275
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:37,108
Frigid, my ass.

1276
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:40,078
Every time my dick
gets next to you,
it shrivels up.

1277
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:42,213
Stop it.
Don't talk
like that.

1278
00:49:42,247 --> 00:49:45,183
I go from condoms to
earmuffs on my dick.

1279
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:49,187
You know the reason
why I have such
a hard time?

1280
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,589
Because
he only likes it
from behind.

1281
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:54,092
He never wants
to look at me.

1282
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,127
I like to look
into his eyes.

1283
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:57,495
He always does that.

1284
00:49:57,528 --> 00:49:59,730
Baby, the doggy style...
That's the thing now.

1285
00:49:59,764 --> 00:50:01,299
That's what's in.

1286
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,733
In? In, my ass, o.K.?

1287
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:04,535
Hey, you're up, 6.

1288
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:06,204
It's Bob regular.

1289
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:07,205
See ya.

1290
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:08,473
O.K.

1291
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:14,745
Bob?

1292
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:16,347
Hey, baby,
how are you?

1293
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:18,283
I'm fine.
I miss you.

1294
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:21,352
You're not going
to believe where
I'm calling you from.

1295
00:50:21,386 --> 00:50:24,089
Oh, let's see.
Your car?

1296
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:25,490
How do you know that?

1297
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,058
'Cause I can tell.

1298
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:28,493
You hear me
all right?
Yeah, I can.

1299
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:29,494
Hello?
Hello.

1300
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:30,495
Hello, lovely.

1301
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:31,496
Yes, Bob.

1302
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,131
Hey, baby.

1303
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:35,533
So, um, how's
your mom doing?

1304
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:38,103
My mom is not
doing so good.

1305
00:50:38,136 --> 00:50:41,706
I'm just driving back
from the hospital now.

1306
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:43,308
I'll tell you
something.

1307
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:46,311
Cancer is
a very bad thing.

1308
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:49,247
It is a beast.

1309
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,149
How are you
holding up?

1310
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:54,085
I'm doing...
I'm doing o.K.

1311
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:57,422
I just feel like I'm wasting
my time, you know?

1312
00:50:57,455 --> 00:50:59,724
Just a big waste
of time out here.

1313
00:50:59,757 --> 00:51:01,226
No point.

1314
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:04,495
Well, you know, Bob,
relationships change.

1315
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:06,631
Not this relationship,
honey.

1316
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:09,134
No, ma'am.
No, thank you.

1317
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:10,535
Look at
you and me.

1318
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,137
When we first
started out,

1319
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,105
It was just
for the sex.

1320
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:16,774
Now every time
I call you, baby,

1321
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,776
All we talk about
is my mother.

1322
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:21,579
But the sex is still
red hot, baby.

1323
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:23,581
Tell you what,
I want you to hang on.

1324
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:25,816
I'm going to pull
this car over.

1325
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:27,652
Just hang on for me.

1326
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,295
I'm back, baby.

1327
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:38,363
Bob.

1328
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:40,265
Yes, lovely.

1329
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:42,300
Can I share
something with you?

1330
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,535
Shoot.

1331
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:47,872
Well, I just...

1332
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:50,408
I just want you
to know

1333
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:51,809
That
the relationship
we share...

1334
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:54,445
You know, talking
about your mom
and everything,

1335
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:56,414
Is really, really
special to me.

1336
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,816
And I just
want you to know

1337
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,818
That I'm always
here for you,

1338
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:03,588
Day or night.
I mean, anytime.

1339
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,590
So don't hesitate
to call me.

1340
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:09,194
I mean, this much time
doesn't have to elapse

1341
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:11,429
Before we connect
again, o.K.?

1342
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,830
Lovely,
I got to go.

1343
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,265
I'll talk
to you later.

1344
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:15,666
Is that
a problem?

1345
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:19,337
Oh, no, no, no, no,
that's no problem,

1346
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:21,539
No problem at all.

1347
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:24,409
Lovely, I'll call you soon.
O.K.

1348
00:52:24,442 --> 00:52:28,579
Remember, lovely
is always going
to be here.

1349
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:30,615
I'll talk to you
later, Bob.

1350
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:31,849
Bye-bye.

1351
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:45,496
And some matches, too.

1352
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,832
Tell me.

1353
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:50,235
You like skiing?

1354
00:52:50,268 --> 00:52:51,702
Not really.

1355
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:52,703
No.

1356
00:52:52,737 --> 00:52:57,275
How about,
um, fishing?

1357
00:52:57,308 --> 00:52:58,276
It's o.K.

1358
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:59,277
Yeah.

1359
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,379
Yeah.

1360
00:53:01,412 --> 00:53:02,380
Who is he?

1361
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:04,449
Who, he?

1362
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:06,251
He's a black bastard.

1363
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:10,921
No offense. No offense,
please, huh?

1364
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:13,724
I want to ask you
something.
Shoot.

1365
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:16,227
I'd like to
take you fishing.

1366
00:53:16,261 --> 00:53:21,999
I have this friend
who's got a cabin
on a lake.

1367
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:26,504
You, me, cabin,
rowboat for two, huh?

1368
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,739
How much?
You, uh..

1369
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:30,875
Work upstairs?

1370
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:32,943
How much are
the cigarettes?

1371
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:35,513
Give me your number.
I'll call you.

1372
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,515
We'll talk
sometimes.

1373
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:38,916
What is the matter
with that, huh?

1374
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,918
Get your fucking hands
off me.

1375
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:44,555
Give me some sex.
Come on.

1376
00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:46,791
I close the shop,
go in the back.

1377
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:47,792
Stop!

1378
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:48,793
O.K., o.K.

1379
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:50,361
Don't do that.

1380
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:51,762
O.K.,
but you know what?

1381
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:53,331
Hey, I'm a rich man.

1382
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:54,732
You know
what I'm saying?

1383
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:56,301
I own this shit.
Yeah.

1384
00:53:56,334 --> 00:53:58,836
You won't have
to do this work.

1385
00:53:58,869 --> 00:53:59,970
Now, come on.
Fishing. Huh?

1386
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:01,439
Or no fishing?

1387
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:05,810
Listen,
you beautiful woman.

1388
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:06,977
Lucky woman.

1389
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:08,579
You could be
my wife.

1390
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,648
I am talking
matrimony over here.

1391
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:12,283
You know
what I'm saying?

1392
00:54:12,317 --> 00:54:14,485
Why don't you just fuck off?
Leave me alone.

1393
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:16,321
Put the cigarettes
in the bag with the matches.

1394
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:17,822
Tell me how
much they cost.

1395
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,290
That's all you
can do for me.

1396
00:54:19,324 --> 00:54:20,725
* if we cannot
make believe *

1397
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,693
* maybe we can
make some time *

1398
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:24,595
* lots of pity
you and me *

1399
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:26,597
* erotic city,
come alive *

1400
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:28,366
* we can fuck
until the dawn *

1401
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:29,734
* making love to...

1402
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,936
We're in the girls'
bathroom, right?

1403
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:34,405
And everybody else
is in class.

1404
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:36,641
I'm going to push you
right into the stall

1405
00:54:36,674 --> 00:54:40,445
And put my hand up that
catholic-school skirt.
Ooh.

1406
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:41,579
[Man]
That's good.
That's good.

1407
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:42,980
I'm so big over here.

1408
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:44,982
I'm, like, deformed.

1409
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:47,785
Oh, Melissa,
unbutton that blouse.

1410
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:49,554
O.K.

1411
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:51,088
Come on,
come on, missy.

1412
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,657
Show them to me.

1413
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,692
Yeah. Show them
to me, too.

1414
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:56,794
Oh, missy.

1415
00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:58,796
Your titties
are so big.

1416
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:00,531
Oh, my God.

1417
00:55:00,565 --> 00:55:01,932
I'm going
to explode.

1418
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:03,100
Yes!

1419
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,536
This is when
I jump out and say,

1420
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:07,838
"What do you two girls
think you're doing?"

1421
00:55:07,872 --> 00:55:09,440
Oh, my God,
Cindy.

1422
00:55:09,474 --> 00:55:11,576
It's Mr. blue,
the custodian.

1423
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:14,545
I pull out my big kielbasa,
and I say,

1424
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:16,747
"Look at my big old kielbasa.

1425
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:19,550
"We're going to have
to work out a bargain,

1426
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:22,820
"Or I'm taking a walk
to the principal's office.

1427
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:25,423
"Why don't you little
naughty girls get down

1428
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:27,425
"And maybe give
Mr. big Jim

1429
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,427
And the twins
a little kiss?"

1430
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,829
Come on, get up there
nice and close.

1431
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:33,398
Ooh, yeah, Mr. blue.

1432
00:55:33,431 --> 00:55:35,833
Oh, the kielbasa's
so big.

1433
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:37,802
Oh, my God.
I love kielbasa.

1434
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,804
Give me a hit
of your cigarette?

1435
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:42,407
Yeah, sure.

1436
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,408
Mmm.

1437
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:45,376
Guess what?

1438
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,412
Hmm.

1439
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:49,013
Bob from Tucson?

1440
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:50,415
Yeah?

1441
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:53,618
He wants to meet me
in person.

1442
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:56,754
I gave him
my phone number.
You what?

1443
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:58,989
You know you're
not supposed
to do that.

1444
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:01,626
Look,
don't get hooked
on this shit.

1445
00:56:01,659 --> 00:56:03,628
It's just talk.
It's a job.

1446
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:05,863
I know, but he's
got a great voice.

1447
00:56:05,896 --> 00:56:07,465
Look,
I don't care.

1448
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:09,434
Did I ever tell
you about...

1449
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:12,470
Yes, you did.
And I don't want
to hear it again.

1450
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:14,439
Give me my cigarette back.
Take it.

1451
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:16,841
I got nothing
to say to you.

1452
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:20,745
Better watch it.
Oh, shit, Jimmy.

1453
00:56:20,778 --> 00:56:22,179
Hanging out,
huh?

1454
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,948
No, no.

1455
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:25,182
I'm getting some milk.
Want something?

1456
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,183
No.

1457
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,184
Later.

1458
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,152
All right.

1459
00:56:28,185 --> 00:56:29,720
What are you
doing here?

1460
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:32,757
I just wanted to bring you
a little something.

1461
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:34,158
No, I didn't steal it.

1462
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:37,595
This old man
gave it to me.

1463
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:41,165
He used to dream
that once he became
a famous actor,

1464
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:43,768
He would get to marry
a beautiful movie star.

1465
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:46,771
He'd say, if you want
something really bad,

1466
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:49,774
You will get a picture of it,
hang it on the wall,

1467
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:52,042
And look at it
every day.

1468
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:55,646
And since you're
into acting and all,

1469
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,182
I figured this
could help you out.

1470
00:56:58,215 --> 00:57:02,052
I hope you like it.
Oh, I love this.

1471
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:05,623
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
No problem.

1472
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:08,158
Can I come up
for a while?

1473
00:57:08,192 --> 00:57:10,461
No, you cannot.

1474
00:57:10,495 --> 00:57:12,863
But thank you
for the magazine,
o.K.?

1475
00:57:12,897 --> 00:57:15,099
And you take care
of yourself.

1476
00:57:19,837 --> 00:57:22,206
When a late-breaking story
hits the news,

1477
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:23,808
Other stories
get pushed aside,

1478
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:26,210
As was the case
of a story

1479
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:28,212
That we covered
four months ago...

1480
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:29,880
A story about
a little girl named Angela,

1481
00:57:29,914 --> 00:57:32,216
Who has one birthday wish.

1482
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:35,620
That wish is to spend time
with a very special lady.

1483
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:37,021
It was a little story,

1484
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:38,956
But one that made
such a big difference

1485
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:40,925
That we decided
to come back here today

1486
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,126
And follow up on it.

1487
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:43,828
That's exactly
what we're doing

1488
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:45,796
With the help of our
very special guest here.

1489
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:48,733
This lady is a movie star
extraordinaire.

1490
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:50,968
She is caring,
compassionate.

1491
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:52,570
She cares
about the community.

1492
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:55,172
This is Halle Berry.
Thank you.

1493
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:58,709
I really can't think
of a better way
to spend today.

1494
00:57:58,743 --> 00:58:00,110
Little Angela's
birthday has touched

1495
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:02,179
Millions of people
around the city,

1496
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:04,982
But it inspired
11,000 people

1497
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:06,884
To respond with
get-well wishes.

1498
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:09,787
If I can be
a part of making
her day special,

1499
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,188
I'm happy
to be here.

1500
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:13,190
Sultan of SWAT?

1501
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:14,525
Yeah, girl.

1502
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,861
Do you have me on
the speakerphone?

1503
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:20,030
Yeah, I got you on
the speakerphone.

1504
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:23,200
Now, I want you
to remember,

1505
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,802
Approaching a girl

1506
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:27,071
Is just like
approaching home plate.

1507
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:28,673
Ha ha ha.

1508
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:29,674
Ha ha.

1509
00:58:29,707 --> 00:58:31,075
I hear you, baby.

1510
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:32,810
I'm, uh...

1511
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,211
I'm a little
nervous.

1512
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:35,780
You know,
them night games,

1513
00:58:35,813 --> 00:58:38,816
Night games
kind of make me
kind of nervous.

1514
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,217
Oh, baby,
come on now,

1515
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,819
Don't be nervous.

1516
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,221
You have to remember,
you're no scrub.

1517
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,557
Oh, baby,
you said that right.

1518
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:48,225
Do you have your
hitter's eye on?

1519
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:51,962
I can see the
rotation on the
seams of the ball

1520
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:54,331
Like Ted Williams.
Ooh.

1521
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,567
Well, I'm on
the pitcher's mound.

1522
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:58,969
Yeah, baby.
I got my pitcher's stance,

1523
00:58:59,003 --> 00:59:01,572
And I've got
that left leg cocked.

1524
00:59:01,606 --> 00:59:03,574
Just like
I like it, baby.

1525
00:59:03,608 --> 00:59:05,309
Tell you
what you do,

1526
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:09,346
And give me that
high leg kick like,
uh, Juan marichel.

1527
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,749
Whoo.
Here it comes, baby...

1528
00:59:11,782 --> 00:59:16,086
A big, fat, juicy one
straight down the middle.

1529
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,022
Shoo.

1530
00:59:20,658 --> 00:59:22,593
[Thwack]

1531
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:27,064
Out of here.

1532
00:59:27,097 --> 00:59:29,233
You could kiss
that baby goodbye.

1533
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:32,637
[Imitates crowd roar]

1534
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:44,248
Whoo.

1535
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:45,816
I love you, girl.

1536
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:48,152
6 for sex,
darling.

1537
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:50,287
Don't I look pretty

1538
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:54,792
With my long blond hair
and big blue eyes?

1539
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:57,227
Don't I look pretty?

1540
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:59,897
I'm getting
on the bus now.

1541
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:03,834
You can smell my hair
as I walk past you.

1542
01:00:03,868 --> 01:00:05,302
You're watching my ass

1543
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:08,305
As I walk
to the back of the bus.

1544
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:10,207
I'm walking.

1545
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,342
I'm walking.

1546
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:15,012
And you want me.

1547
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:17,748
I'm turning around now.

1548
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:20,317
I'm sitting down now.

1549
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,788
I'm crossing my legs now,

1550
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:26,223
And you're watching me.

1551
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:29,727
My flower bed
is all wet now, lover.

1552
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,663
Listen to my flower bed.

1553
01:00:32,697 --> 01:00:34,899
[Moaning]

1554
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:38,903
Now take my boots off.

1555
01:00:38,936 --> 01:00:40,738
Yes, yes.

1556
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:42,673
Now rip my stockings off
with your teeth.

1557
01:00:42,707 --> 01:00:44,441
Oh, yes!

1558
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,811
Don't my feet
look pretty?

1559
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:49,346
Now touch them.
Tickle them.

1560
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,281
[Giggling]

1561
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,050
Oh, yes, yes.

1562
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:56,286
Oh, yes.
Faster, faster, faster.

1563
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,655
Yes!

1564
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:02,192
Don't I look pretty?

1565
01:01:06,196 --> 01:01:10,801
* eatin' my dinner
in a fancy restaurant *

1566
01:01:10,835 --> 01:01:12,336
Hi.

1567
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:13,370
Working?

1568
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:15,205
Ooh, what a surprise.

1569
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:17,708
You went in,
I figured
you'd come out.

1570
01:01:17,742 --> 01:01:19,710
I didn't know
you had a brain.

1571
01:01:19,744 --> 01:01:21,111
Got anybody new?

1572
01:01:21,145 --> 01:01:22,847
Yeah. I got this guy
named Bob regular.

1573
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,114
He's fabulous.
You should meet him.

1574
01:01:24,148 --> 01:01:25,482
I would like
to meet him.

1575
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,451
Bob regular.
What kind of name
is that?

1576
01:01:27,484 --> 01:01:29,053
I got to run.

1577
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:30,420
You got to eat.

1578
01:01:30,454 --> 01:01:32,422
We can go eat
at Sylvia's.

1579
01:01:32,456 --> 01:01:35,025
I'm sorry, but
I got other plans.

1580
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:36,426
All right,
tomorrow.

1581
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,427
Hmm?

1582
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:38,863
Friday.

1583
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:39,897
Friday.

1584
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:40,865
Friday's fine.

1585
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:42,299
Good.
Friday's good.

1586
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:43,768
Good Friday.

1587
01:01:50,908 --> 01:01:54,011
One of my all-time
favorite characters

1588
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,046
Is foxy brown.

1589
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,348
Right on.
Power to the people.

1590
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:00,050
Talk to me fast,
baby.

1591
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:01,451
I got five
heavy-tripping,

01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:02,920
Jive turkeys
on my tail.

1593
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:04,221
Check it out, mama.

1594
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:05,890
The boss man want us
to meet him in Paris.

1595
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:07,191
There's a 4:30 plane.
I'm just across town.

1596
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:08,192
I'll pick you up.

1597
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:09,326
I'm here, baby.

1598
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,161
Stay black and beautiful,
my sister.

1599
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:13,430
Right on.
Power to the people.

1600
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:16,166
Put the phone down, lady.
You surrounded.

1601
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,401
What's wrong?
Who's there?

1602
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:19,403
Hold them off
until I get there.

1603
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:21,271
I'm on my way.

1604
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:25,142
Come on, mama.
Don't make me ask again.

1605
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:27,011
Put the phone down.

1606
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:32,783
You're looking for an
ass-kicking now, mama.

1607
01:02:32,817 --> 01:02:34,051
Yeah, baby.

1608
01:02:57,541 --> 01:03:01,345
[Groaning]

1609
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:06,416
Damn, woman.
You's a bad...

1610
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,085
Shut your mouth!

1611
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:10,320
I'm just talking
about my sister.

1612
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:11,956
Can you dig it?

1613
01:03:14,892 --> 01:03:16,861
Step aside, little mama.

1614
01:03:19,063 --> 01:03:21,431
Don't you know
the black woman

1615
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,834
Is the mother
of civilization?

1616
01:03:23,868 --> 01:03:26,070
You didn't have to
shoot them, stupid.

1617
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:27,905
Let's go to Paris.

1618
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:37,181
Hello, lovely.
It's Bob.

1619
01:03:37,214 --> 01:03:38,582
Where you been?

1620
01:03:38,615 --> 01:03:40,150
I've been busy.

1621
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:42,452
Thought you'd be glad
to hear my voice.

1622
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,488
I am.

1623
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:47,057
It's just, um...

1624
01:03:47,091 --> 01:03:50,928
It's funny hearing
your voice, that's all.

1625
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:55,065
How's your mom doing?

1626
01:03:55,099 --> 01:03:57,434
Listen, I'm
going to be coming
to the big apple

1627
01:03:57,467 --> 01:04:00,470
For one day only
to close up
a big deal.

1628
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,539
I got a little free
time around 2:00.

1629
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:04,141
Let's do
something crazy.

1630
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:07,311
I'm working
a double shift tomorrow.

1631
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,446
Come on. Let's do
something crazy.

1632
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:12,082
Let's go
to coney island,
have some hot dogs,

1633
01:04:12,116 --> 01:04:13,483
Make love
under the boardwalk,

1634
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:14,919
Just like
the song says.

1635
01:04:14,952 --> 01:04:16,420
I'm working, Bob.

1636
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:18,956
Take a vacation,
girl.

1637
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:22,459
Please? I really
want to see you.

1638
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:24,428
Say yes.

1639
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:27,064
All right.

1640
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:28,565
One hot dog.

1641
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:30,467
One Nathan's
hot dog.

1642
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,469
And nothing else.

1643
01:04:32,502 --> 01:04:34,004
O.K., nothing else.

1644
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:35,372
Tomorrow at 2:00.

1645
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:37,474
Yes, I'll see you
at 2:00.

1646
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:38,442
Bye-bye.

1647
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:40,144
All right, baby.
Bye-bye.

It is so unprofessional.

over there.

1700
01:08:32,576 --> 01:08:35,145
I'm going to start
cracking down.

tie you up real good.

familiar to me.

No.

O.K.

1726
01:09:33,737 --> 01:09:36,573
Look, you do not
have to be polite.

1727
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:37,941
I wasn't being polite.

Yeah, well,
whatever. Don't be.

Don't encourage
them, o.K.?

Mm-hmm.

Now, why would
you do a thing
like that to me?

I just want to talk
to you. That's all.

You don't have to be shy
with me, girl 6.

1734
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,563
I'll be good
from now on.

Your daughter looked
as if she was making
a miraculous recovery.

01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:09,573
I mean, all
of us were hoping
she'd be released,

1739
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:11,675
And released
from the hospital
very soon.

1740

the lord's hands now.

is the girl.

on the pink one,

an elevator shaft,

A story that has riveted
this city

And changed
some safety policies.

I'm doing fine.
How are you doing?

1768
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:27,651
My usual
criminal activity.

1769
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:29,919
I still haven't used a gun,
don't intend to,

1770
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:31,921
And I don't go into
people's houses.

1771
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:33,523
I only take from those

1772
01:11:33,557 --> 01:11:35,525
Who got more
than they need.

1773
01:11:35,559 --> 01:11:36,960
That's still my speed.

1774
01:11:36,993 --> 01:11:38,928
You know, supermarkets,

1775
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:41,064
The woolworth's, Macy's,
Korean delis.

1776
01:11:41,097 --> 01:11:42,966
I only take
what I can use...

1777
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:44,534
Clothes, food,

1778
01:11:44,568 --> 01:11:46,536
Your basic fruits
and vegetables,

1779
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:47,937
Meats,
chickens, beef,

1780
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:52,075
Porks, cold cuts,
rice, cereal, milk.

1781
01:11:53,577 --> 01:11:55,945
Damn. You
still smell good.

1782
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:58,314
We had some fun,
didn't we, huh?

1783
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:02,986
Here you go,
enjoy your pie.
Thanks, man.

1784
01:12:03,019 --> 01:12:06,923
You're welcome.
I try to eat balanced.

1785
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:08,958
I still got
my sweet tooth,
you know,

1786
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:10,960
But I still got
my bad habits, too.

1787
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:12,596
Basically good,
but...

1788
01:12:12,629 --> 01:12:14,398
Bad habits.

1789
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:16,433
How is everybody?

1790
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:19,503
Moms doesn't
like me living
at home anymore.

1791
01:12:19,536 --> 01:12:21,505
I told her
I'd seen you.

1792
01:12:21,538 --> 01:12:24,007
She says an ex-wife
is a sign.

1793
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,909
Oh, did she?
Mm-hmm.

1794
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:28,378
You're the only
true love I got.
You know that.

1795
01:12:28,412 --> 01:12:30,547
Really? Well, um...

1796
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,582
I'm going to be
leaving town soon,

1797
01:12:32,616 --> 01:12:35,552
As soon as I'm able...
For good.

1798
01:12:35,585 --> 01:12:38,888
I'm going to California.

1799
01:12:38,922 --> 01:12:39,889
But, um...

1800
01:12:39,923 --> 01:12:42,125
You do that, uh...

1801
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:43,760
That freelance
typing thing.

1802
01:12:43,793 --> 01:12:44,994
Temp work, right?

1803
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:45,995
Wrong.

1804
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,697
I'm into phone sex.

1805
01:12:47,731 --> 01:12:48,698
No shit.

1806
01:12:48,732 --> 01:12:49,966
Yeah.

1807
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:51,535
What, you?

1808
01:12:51,568 --> 01:12:52,936
Why not me?

1809
01:12:54,638 --> 01:12:56,440
Have you ever
called one before?

1810
01:12:56,473 --> 01:12:58,575
Hell no.
I like touch.

1811
01:12:58,608 --> 01:12:59,576
Yeah?

1812
01:12:59,609 --> 01:13:00,577
Mm-hmm.

1813
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:01,811
Call me.

1814
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:04,581
Ring, ring.

1815
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:06,450
Come on.

1816
01:13:06,483 --> 01:13:07,451
Ring.

1817
01:13:07,484 --> 01:13:08,452
All right.

1818
01:13:08,485 --> 01:13:09,853
Come on, call me.

1819
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:10,854
Ahem.

1820
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:11,988
Ring.

1821
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:13,990
Ring.

1822
01:13:14,023 --> 01:13:15,925
Ring.

1823
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:16,926
Ring.

1824
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,528
Ring, God damn it.

1825
01:13:18,562 --> 01:13:20,930
Ring.

1826
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:22,566
Hello.

1827
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:24,701
Hey.

1828
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:27,971
My name is lovely.

1829
01:13:28,004 --> 01:13:29,573
What's yours?

1830
01:13:29,606 --> 01:13:31,575
Joe schbotnick.

1831
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:32,976
Ooh, Joe.

1832
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:36,980
You have a really
sexy voice.

1833
01:13:37,013 --> 01:13:38,982
Where are you
calling from?

1834
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:39,983
Death row.

1835
01:13:40,016 --> 01:13:41,585
Ooh, death row.

1836
01:13:41,618 --> 01:13:43,987
That means you are
a dangerous man, Joe.

1837
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,589
That's right.
Fuckin'-a, man.

1838
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:48,157
Would you like to know
what I look like?

1839
01:13:48,191 --> 01:13:49,726
Sure. Fire away.

1840
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:52,996
I've got blond hair,

1841
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:57,000
Deep, dark, sensuous eyes,

1842
01:13:57,033 --> 01:13:59,603
I'm 5'6",

1843
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:01,605
And my best features

1844
01:14:01,638 --> 01:14:04,608
Are my big breasts.

1845
01:14:04,641 --> 01:14:07,511
They're 40 double-d.

1846
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:10,847
Oh, bitchin'.

1847
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,550
40 double-ds! Dude!

1848
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:16,586
Ooh...

1849
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:19,088
I'm a deep throat, Joe.

1850
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:22,692
Oh, you want some
of this, baby?

1851
01:14:22,726 --> 01:14:25,729
Mmm...
Fuckin'-a, man.

1852
01:14:25,762 --> 01:14:28,565
God damn.

1853
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:32,569
And I want you
so bad, sweet daddy.

1854
01:14:32,602 --> 01:14:35,539
You like that,
Mr. Joe schbotnick?

1855
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:42,512
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-
mmm-mmm-mmm.

1856
01:14:42,546 --> 01:14:43,847
Damn.

1857
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,615
I didn't know you
were such a freak.

1858
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:46,983
I always was.

1859
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:48,985
You just never
brought it out in me.

1860
01:14:49,018 --> 01:14:51,020
I just never brought
it out in you.

1861
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:52,589
You heard me.

1862
01:14:52,622 --> 01:14:54,023
Let me show you something.

1863
01:14:54,057 --> 01:14:55,792
What?
A little shortcut.

1864
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:57,994
I know you're playing.
You're always playing.

1865
01:14:58,027 --> 01:14:59,629
Come on, come on,
come on.

1866
01:14:59,663 --> 01:15:00,697
What?

1867
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,632
Baby girl,
what a pretty hand.

1868
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:04,033
Oh, how sweet.

1869
01:15:04,067 --> 01:15:05,935
What are you doing?

1870
01:15:05,969 --> 01:15:08,605
Would you stop it?
Wait a minute.

1871
01:15:08,638 --> 01:15:10,607
What do you think
you're doing?

1872
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,842
Don't put my hands
down your pants.
What's wrong with you?

1873
01:15:12,876 --> 01:15:14,644
What do you expect,
talking to me like that?

1874
01:15:14,678 --> 01:15:15,945
I was just playing
with you.

1875
01:15:15,979 --> 01:15:17,547
I don't play like that,
all right?

1876
01:15:17,581 --> 01:15:19,549
Don't step up on me
like that, o.K.?

1877
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:21,785
I should kick my own ass
for even going out with you.

1878
01:15:21,818 --> 01:15:23,820
You're right. I'm sorry.
You're damn straight,
you're sorry.

1879
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:25,722
So take your sorry ass home
to your mama.

1880
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:26,990
You're right.

1881
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,730
Shit.

1882
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:38,868
[Cat screeches]

1883
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,585
Aah!

1884
01:15:55,619 --> 01:15:57,621
Oh, my God!
You see it?

1885
01:15:57,654 --> 01:15:59,989
I see it! I see it!

1886
01:16:00,023 --> 01:16:01,591
He spared
no expense, lil.

1887
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:02,992
He spared
no expense.

1888
01:16:03,026 --> 01:16:04,293
No expense.
Well, show everybody.

1889
01:16:04,327 --> 01:16:05,361
Go ahead. Go ahead.

1890
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:06,830
It's gorgeous.

1891
01:16:06,863 --> 01:16:08,865
Aah!

1892
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:10,900
Oh, wait...
Wait a minute.

1893
01:16:10,934 --> 01:16:12,268
Where's miss 6?

1894
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:14,971
Working, working,
working.

1895
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:20,343
Hello.

1896
01:16:20,376 --> 01:16:21,911
I got this
special fantasy.

1897
01:16:21,945 --> 01:16:23,312
Can I tell you?

1898
01:16:23,346 --> 01:16:25,248
Tell me.

1899
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,995
Hey.

1900
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:46,770
* in France there
lived a man who died
of a big disease *

1901
01:16:46,803 --> 01:16:48,371
* with a little name

1902
01:16:48,404 --> 01:16:50,774
* by chance, his girlfriend
came across a needle *

1903
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:53,342
* and soon she did the same

1904
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:56,012
All right, sexy 6.

1905
01:16:56,045 --> 01:16:58,214
It's back
to the salt mines.

1906
01:16:58,247 --> 01:17:00,650
* is being in a gang
called the disciples *

1907
01:17:00,684 --> 01:17:03,319
* high on crack,
toting a machine gun... *

1908
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:05,922
You're like
this hot co-ed.

1909
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,323
You know,
head cheerleader,

1910
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:10,359
And I am the principal
of the school.

1911
01:17:10,393 --> 01:17:12,095
Ooh. Yeah.

1912
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:14,330
Yeah, you see,
everybody's been worried

1913
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:17,300
Because you're just too,
too hot,

1914
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:20,136
And you turn
everybody on too much.

1915
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:23,139
Ooh, yeah, because
I get them hard,

1916
01:17:23,172 --> 01:17:25,942
And it's, like,
so distracting.

1917
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:28,912
Are you, uh...

1918
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:30,313
Hard right now?

1919
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:31,881
I sure am, baby.

1920
01:17:31,915 --> 01:17:33,349
Now, see,
I'm the principal,

1921
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:35,819
And I have to
discipline you.

1922
01:17:35,852 --> 01:17:39,055
Yes, Mr. principal.

1923
01:17:40,356 --> 01:17:42,759
Unzip my pants
and take it out.

1924
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,329
You just
took my hand

1925
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:49,833
And shoved it
down your thing.

1926
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:51,835
Tell me how much
you need it. Tell me.

1927
01:17:51,868 --> 01:17:53,970
I'm so wet.
I need it.

1928
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:55,972
That's good.

1929
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:57,907
Beg for it, sweetheart.

1930
01:17:57,941 --> 01:18:01,711
Oh, please
give it to me,
Mr. principal,

1931
01:18:01,745 --> 01:18:03,112
Because I'm so...

1932
01:18:03,146 --> 01:18:04,347
I'm so...

1933
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,983
I'm so bad,
Mr. principal.

1934
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:08,852
Yeah, that's good.

1935
01:18:08,885 --> 01:18:12,388
Ooh, give it
to me, please.

1936
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:14,390
You want some more?

1937
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:16,292
Huh?

1938
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:19,062
You want some more,
Mr. principal?

1939
01:18:19,095 --> 01:18:20,897
No, no. That's good.
That's good.

1940
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:22,698
Thanks a lot.
I enjoyed that.

1941
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:32,942
Hey.

1942
01:18:32,976 --> 01:18:34,343
6...

1943
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:35,945
You all right?

1944
01:18:35,979 --> 01:18:37,346
Do I look all right?

1945
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,315
No. You look like shit.

1946

Come on down
from that sink.

1947
01:18:41,985 --> 01:18:43,953
I'm sending you home, baby.

1948
01:18:43,987 --> 01:18:45,321
You're burned out.

Look, hey, hey, hey.
Come here.

1953
01:18:55,932 --> 01:18:58,334
I know what
I'm talking about,
o.K., baby?

1954
01:18:58,367 --> 01:18:59,969
I've been
through this.

1955
01:19:00,003 --> 01:19:02,338
You need some rest.
Yeah?

1956
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:04,373
So, what are you
trying to tell me,

1957
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:05,975
I'm on leave?

1958
01:19:06,009 --> 01:19:07,343
Yeah, you on leave.

1959

You go somewhere,
recharge your batteries.

1960
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:11,380
You come back,
you're good as new.

1961

1962
01:19:13,016 --> 01:19:14,383

1963
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:16,219
Mmm.

1964
01:19:17,954 --> 01:19:19,923
I need this job, lil.

1965
01:19:19,956 --> 01:19:22,325
I know you need
the job, 6,

1966
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:25,328
But I'm not changing
my mind, o.K.?

1967
01:19:25,361 --> 01:19:26,930
Now, go on home.

1968
01:19:26,963 --> 01:19:28,197
Go ahead.

1969
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:34,938
Is that job
still available?

1970
01:19:34,971 --> 01:19:36,339
Why the change of heart?

1971
01:19:36,372 --> 01:19:38,041
I got my own phone.

1972
01:19:38,074 --> 01:19:39,442
Still got those pipes?

1973
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:42,345
Yes, I do.

1974
01:19:42,378 --> 01:19:44,948
Good. When do you
want to start?

1975
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:46,983
As soon as possible.

1979
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:19,348
If you do decide
to accept this mission,

1980
01:20:19,382 --> 01:20:20,917
You must realize

1981
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:23,152
That your own private line
is essential.

1982
01:20:23,186 --> 01:20:25,955
I suggest getting
an unlisted phone number

1983
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:28,357
That is inaccessible
to caller i.D.

1984
01:20:28,391 --> 01:20:31,194
Choose a phone
with a lightweight receiver.

1985
01:20:31,227 --> 01:20:33,296
I suggest getting a headset.

1986
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:36,933
That way your hands
are kept free.

1987
01:20:36,966 --> 01:20:39,368
While office-bound
fantasy girls are restricted

1988
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:41,270
By what they can say,

1989
01:20:41,304 --> 01:20:44,240
A fantasy girl
who works out of the home,

1990
01:20:44,273 --> 01:20:45,474
A home girl,

1991
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:48,544
Can experience complete
and total freedom.

1992
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:50,513
You can invite your caller

1993
01:20:50,546 --> 01:20:52,982

his deepest,

2000
01:21:02,558 --> 01:21:05,561
No taboos.

2001
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:11,400
Yeah.

2002
01:21:11,434 --> 01:21:14,403
Are you ready, baby?

2003
01:21:14,437 --> 01:21:16,339
Huh?

2004

This is the man

And you better
get another girl
to wipe your feet with.

some sicko calls...

Listen here, baby.

You got to listen
to your father.

But, ma!

2033
01:22:26,009 --> 01:22:28,978
How was I supposed
to know he was a sicko?

2034
01:22:29,012 --> 01:22:32,281
All he kept saying was,
"can I come over?

2035

be right here.

going to do, George?

that stuff out here,

stolen cigarettes.

Take them and get out.

I get sick
of this nonsense
week after week.

2129
01:26:08,731 --> 01:26:11,234
It's always the same
with those girls
upstairs,

2130

Those bloody
phone sex girls.

2131

Phone sex girls?
Yes.

Don't you dare

I just thought
she was somebody I knew.

2149

Yeah, well, she's not.

[Ronnie speaking spanish]

2153
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:19,435
Don't take it personal.
She doesn't speak to me,
either.

2154
01:27:19,468 --> 01:27:21,304
I guess
she's working, huh?

2155
01:27:21,337 --> 01:27:24,273
Yeah.
I hear her sometimes
through the door.

2156
01:27:24,307 --> 01:27:25,741
I haven't seen her
in weeks.

2157
01:27:25,774 --> 01:27:27,410
She gave me her number...
It's unlisted...

2158
01:27:27,443 --> 01:27:29,712
But she told me not
to give it to you.

2159
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:33,316
Besides,
she screens her calls
and don't call back.

2160
01:27:33,349 --> 01:27:35,418
I miss her, man.

2161
01:27:35,451 --> 01:27:38,387
If you could get her
to call me...

2162

I don't know.

2163
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:41,690

It's me calling

Can you take three
of Niki's regs today?

2169
01:28:00,509 --> 01:28:01,644
She's got the flu.

2170

Call me back asap.

2171
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:05,714

You never
call me back, girl.

2176
01:28:12,488 --> 01:28:13,656
I never see you.

2177

Hi, baby doll.

This is your lover calling.

2181
01:28:20,396 --> 01:28:22,331
I'm surprised
you're not home.

2182
01:28:22,365 --> 01:28:23,966
I usually don't
leave messages,

2183
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:25,534
And I don't really
like machines.

2184
01:28:25,568 --> 01:28:27,803
I much prefer human beings.

2185
01:28:27,836 --> 01:28:31,039
I think whoever invented
the answering machine
should be shot.

2186

How can we continue
this romance

Bye, baby doll.

Hello, love.
It's Mr. snuff.

2190
01:28:46,955 --> 01:28:48,757
I know.

2191
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:52,795
Uh, listen,
I want to ask you
a question...

2192
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:54,062
Are you ugly?

2193
01:28:54,096 --> 01:28:55,464
No. I'm beautiful.

2194
01:28:55,498 --> 01:28:57,500
The reason
I ask you that

2195
01:28:57,533 --> 01:29:00,102
Is because I was
watching Oprah
the other day,

2196
01:29:00,135 --> 01:29:02,638
And they had
the program
on phone sex,

2197
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:04,973
And every one
of those girls
was ugly.

2198
01:29:05,007 --> 01:29:07,710
So I'm asking you,
are you ugly?

2199
01:29:07,743 --> 01:29:10,413
No. I'm absolutely,

2200
01:29:10,446 --> 01:29:12,681
Positively gorgeous.

2201
01:29:12,715 --> 01:29:13,749
You're beautiful?

2202
01:29:13,782 --> 01:29:16,452
Yes, I'm beautiful.

2203
01:29:16,485 --> 01:29:17,720
That doesn't
make sense.

2204
01:29:17,753 --> 01:29:19,522
How can a slut
be beautiful?

2205
01:29:19,555 --> 01:29:22,458
The Mona Lisa's
beautiful.

2206
01:29:22,491 --> 01:29:24,393
The statue of liberty's
beautiful.

The grand canyon,
the first day of spring,

2208
01:29:26,429 --> 01:29:28,030

that's beauty,

2209
01:29:28,063 --> 01:29:29,765
But a slut...

2210
01:29:29,798 --> 01:29:32,501
Is just slutty, right?

2211
01:29:32,535 --> 01:29:33,602
You know?

2212
01:29:33,636 --> 01:29:35,404
Yes.

2213
01:29:35,438 --> 01:29:36,672
Did you miss me?

2214
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:39,107
Kind of.

2215
01:29:39,141 --> 01:29:40,776
I missed you.

2216
01:29:40,809 --> 01:29:43,111
You know, I really
opened up to you.

2217
01:29:43,145 --> 01:29:45,414
I've opened my heart
up to you.

2218
01:29:45,448 --> 01:29:46,449

2219
01:29:46,482 --> 01:29:47,750

2220
01:29:47,783 --> 01:29:50,152
I do, absolutely.

2221
01:29:50,185 --> 01:29:52,855
And now it's time
for the good part.

2222
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:55,023
I'm scared.

2223
01:29:55,057 --> 01:29:56,659
I'll be quick,

2224
01:29:56,692 --> 01:29:59,462
And you'll be
much happier
when it's over.

2225
01:29:59,495 --> 01:30:00,663
O.K.

2226
01:30:00,696 --> 01:30:02,598
You're not happy
now, are you?

2227
01:30:02,631 --> 01:30:04,600
No.
No.

2228
01:30:04,633 --> 01:30:07,570
You're not happy
because you're
a fuck slut, right?

2229
01:30:07,603 --> 01:30:08,737
Right.

2230
01:30:08,771 --> 01:30:10,072
So say that.

2231
01:30:10,105 --> 01:30:12,074
I'm a fuck slut.

2232
01:30:12,107 --> 01:30:14,843
No, no. "I'm not
happy because..."

2233
01:30:14,877 --> 01:30:15,944
Say it.

2234
01:30:15,978 --> 01:30:18,847
I'm not happy...

2235
01:30:18,881 --> 01:30:20,649
Because I'm
a fuck slut.

2236
01:30:20,683 --> 01:30:22,184
That's right.
There you go.

2237
01:30:22,217 --> 01:30:24,019
But you're going
to be much happier

2238
01:30:24,052 --> 01:30:25,588
When everything
is said and done.

2239
01:30:25,621 --> 01:30:27,623
Now, this is what
we're going to do.

2240
01:30:27,656 --> 01:30:29,892
We're going to put
your head in the bag.

2241
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:31,894
We're going to tie it
nice and tight.

2242
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:33,829
We're going to tie it
nice and snug.

2243
01:30:33,862 --> 01:30:36,899
And then I'm going to give you
the fuck of your life.

2244
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:38,166
I'll do that for you.

2245
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,802
And then it's lights out.

2246
01:30:39,835 --> 01:30:40,936
Oh, no.

2247
01:30:40,969 --> 01:30:44,039
Lights completely out.

2248
01:30:44,072 --> 01:30:46,709
Why are you
doing this to me?

2249
01:30:46,742 --> 01:30:48,577
That's none
of your fucking business.

2250
01:30:48,611 --> 01:30:50,145
But you have to
make it my business

2251
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:51,647
Because I want
to love you.

2252
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,516
Don't you contradict me.

2253
01:30:53,549 --> 01:30:55,183
I don't need anything
from you, you understand?

2254
01:30:55,217 --> 01:30:58,954
Yes.
Are you ready? O.K.

2255
01:30:58,987 --> 01:31:02,024
Good. We're going to spice
things up, all right?
Mm-hmm.

2256

I'm going to come
to your apartment,

2257
01:31:04,126 --> 01:31:06,562
And we're going to do this
for real. How does that sound?

2258
01:31:06,595 --> 01:31:10,766
Oh, baby, please,
let's do it like this.

2259
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:13,536
Don't you fucking perform.
I'm not.

Don't you fucking
perform for me.

the performing.

I'm not performing for you.

2264
01:31:22,244 --> 01:31:23,912
Then what are you doing?

2265
01:31:23,946 --> 01:31:27,750
I just want to...
I just want to love you.

2266

No, no, I don't want
your love.

2267

I don't need your love.
I have enough love.

I have plenty,
believe me.

2269

I have a mother.
I have friends.

2270

Oh, come on,
give it to me.

2272
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:39,628
Please.
Bullshit.

2273

very close to you.

And I'll be there
in a few minutes.

2276

I'll get that bag
tied around your head,

[Ring]

2294
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,081
Hello?

2295
01:32:33,115 --> 01:32:34,683
Hey, I'm out
on the corner.

2296
01:32:34,717 --> 01:32:36,652
I was wondering
if you needed anything.

2297
01:32:36,685 --> 01:32:38,220
Maybe some haagen-dazs?

2298
01:32:38,253 --> 01:32:40,288
Or how about a dozen
of those long-stemmed red roses

2299
01:32:40,322 --> 01:32:41,757
That you love so much?

2300
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:45,728
Look, why don't you
just leave me alone?

2301
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:51,199
[Ring]

2302
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:54,737
[Ring]

2303
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:55,771
Hello?

2304
01:32:55,804 --> 01:32:57,239
Well, guess what.

2305
01:32:57,272 --> 01:32:59,642
They're out of the green bags,
but I got the blue,

2306
01:32:59,675 --> 01:33:00,809
And they're
the see-through kind,

2307
01:33:00,843 --> 01:33:01,944
Is that good?

2308
01:33:01,977 --> 01:33:04,346
You know what, um...

2309
01:33:04,379 --> 01:33:07,049
That sounds really,
really good, baby.

2310
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:11,353
I think you should get
those green baggies
and come on over

2311
01:33:11,386 --> 01:33:14,222
Because I got something
for your ass,
you sick motherfucker!

2312
01:33:14,256 --> 01:33:16,358
I'm going to kill you
if you come over here!

2313
01:33:16,391 --> 01:33:18,794
That's what I want to hear.
I swear to God
I'm going to kill you!

2314
01:33:18,827 --> 01:33:22,264
Why you been holding
out on me like that?
[Shouting]

2315
01:33:22,297 --> 01:33:24,800
Why'd you hold out
on me?
Come over!

2316
01:33:24,833 --> 01:33:26,802
That's right.

2317
01:33:26,835 --> 01:33:29,772
[Ring]

2318
01:33:52,728 --> 01:33:54,162
Jimmy!

2319
01:33:54,196 --> 01:33:56,098
Jimmy!

2320
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:57,332
What?

2321
01:33:57,365 --> 01:33:58,366
Open the door.

2322
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,868
Hold on, hold on.

2323
01:33:59,902 --> 01:34:03,271
You got to
let me in, Jimmy.
Look at you.

2324
01:34:03,305 --> 01:34:04,873
Please let me
spend the night.

2325
01:34:04,907 --> 01:34:07,009
Yes.
Phone bone stuff?

2326
01:34:07,042 --> 01:34:10,212
Come on. You look
pitiful. Pitiful.

2327
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:20,022
Jimmy?

2328
01:34:21,724 --> 01:34:22,991
Jimmy?

2329
01:34:23,025 --> 01:34:25,060
Jimmy?

2330
01:34:25,093 --> 01:34:26,695
What?

2331
01:34:26,729 --> 01:34:28,130
You asleep?

2332
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:31,066
Yes.

2333
01:34:31,099 --> 01:34:32,367
Guess what.

2334
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,837
What?

2335
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:37,005
I'm going to go
to Los Angeles.

2336
01:34:40,909 --> 01:34:45,280
I thought L.A.
was falling into
the pacific ocean.

2337
01:34:45,313 --> 01:34:49,284
No, I just think
that it's, um...

2338
01:34:49,317 --> 01:34:52,320
You know, it's time
that I started

2339
01:34:52,354 --> 01:34:55,858
Pursuing my acting thing,
you know?

2340
01:34:55,891 --> 01:34:58,326
You mean it
this time, huh?

2341
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:01,196
Yeah.

2342
01:35:01,229 --> 01:35:04,499
Well, if that's what
you want to do...

2343
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:07,702
I'm all for it.
I'm happy for you.

2344
01:35:08,904 --> 01:35:11,306
Thank you.

2345
01:35:11,339 --> 01:35:14,309
You know, I've been...

2346
01:35:14,342 --> 01:35:18,246
Trying to tell you...
If I ever saw you...

2347
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:21,083
That, uh,
I finally broke down

2348
01:35:21,116 --> 01:35:25,387
And sold off some
of my memorabilia
collection.

2349
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:26,488
Really?

2350
01:35:26,521 --> 01:35:27,956
Yup.

2351
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:30,092
It was hard to do,
but, uh...

2352
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:32,227
I can't wait 20 years.

2353
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:35,030
I got to eat now.
I got to pay the rent.

2354
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:37,332
Especially since
you're moving.

2355
01:35:37,365 --> 01:35:40,102
Who am I going
to borrow money from?

2356
01:35:40,135 --> 01:35:42,971
Ha ha ha.

2357
01:35:43,005 --> 01:35:46,041
Some other fool,
I guess. Ha ha.

2358
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:50,412
I got something for you,
I want to give you.

2359
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:52,848
This is a tops,

2360
01:35:52,881 --> 01:35:56,351
Mint condition
1964 baseball card,

2361
01:35:56,384 --> 01:35:58,987
Signed by Hank Aaron
and Willie mays,

2362
01:35:59,021 --> 01:36:01,189
Both hall of famers.

2363
01:36:01,223 --> 01:36:02,991
Hank Aaron's
hit more home runs

2364
01:36:03,025 --> 01:36:05,027
Than anybody
in major league baseball,

2365
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:07,529
More than babe Ruth.

2366
01:36:07,562 --> 01:36:09,231
It's for you.

2367
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:12,000
Signed by both.

2368
01:36:12,034 --> 01:36:14,937
So remember me
by that, all right?

2369
01:36:15,938 --> 01:36:17,172
Give me a kiss.

2370
01:36:17,205 --> 01:36:18,273
All right.

2371
01:36:18,306 --> 01:36:19,341
I will.

2372
01:36:19,374 --> 01:36:21,143
Don't sell that.

2373
01:36:21,176 --> 01:36:24,579
No matter
how low you get,

2374
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:26,581
Don't ever
sell that one.

2375
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:28,183
Say hey,
Willie mays...

2376
01:36:28,216 --> 01:36:30,452
The greatest ball player
that ever lived.

2377
01:36:30,485 --> 01:36:33,856
[Woman chattering]

2378
01:36:39,194 --> 01:36:41,196
Asked Jesus,

2379
01:36:41,229 --> 01:36:43,165
"Who is the greatest
in the kingdom of heaven?"

2380
01:36:43,198 --> 01:36:44,566
It says in the Bible

2381
01:36:44,599 --> 01:36:46,835
Jesus called
a little child onto him

2382
01:36:46,869 --> 01:36:49,404
And set the child
in the middle of them.

2383
01:36:49,437 --> 01:36:51,073
Hi.
Hi.

2384
01:36:51,106 --> 01:36:54,376
I decided to bring this
to you in person.

2385
01:36:54,409 --> 01:36:56,478
Angela, look at that.
That's for you.

2386
01:36:56,511 --> 01:36:58,914
What you going to say
to the lady?

2387
01:36:58,947 --> 01:37:00,048
Thank you.

2388
01:37:00,082 --> 01:37:01,449
Oh, you're welcome,
honey.

2389
01:37:01,483 --> 01:37:04,152
Say God bless you.
God bless you.

2390
01:37:04,186 --> 01:37:06,922
God bless you, too.
Can I have a kiss?

2391
01:37:06,955 --> 01:37:08,190
Thank you
for the money.

2392
01:37:10,192 --> 01:37:12,360
God will bless you, miss.
Thank you.

2393
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:19,134
Hey.

2394
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:21,403
I heard your girl
Angie got out.

2395
01:37:21,436 --> 01:37:23,438
Thought we could
celebrate.

2396
01:37:28,210 --> 01:37:29,577
You been calling
my house?

2397
01:37:29,611 --> 01:37:31,179
I would,
but you're unlisted.

2398
01:37:31,213 --> 01:37:33,015
I just wanted
a normal conversation.

2399
01:37:33,048 --> 01:37:35,617
All right.
I'm going to L.A.
where it's safe.

2400
01:37:35,650 --> 01:37:37,953
How in the hell
is L.A. safe?

2401
01:37:37,986 --> 01:37:39,521
It's safer than here.

2402
01:37:39,554 --> 01:37:42,090
Plus I got to get
my acting thing
going again.

2403
01:37:42,124 --> 01:37:43,926
You can't act
in New York?

2404
01:37:43,959 --> 01:37:45,360
No. There's
too much history.

2405
01:37:45,393 --> 01:37:46,628
Oh, Judy.

2406
01:37:46,661 --> 01:37:48,496
I'm going
to miss you, Judy.

2407
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:50,632
Judy.

2408
01:37:50,665 --> 01:37:54,402
I always did
like the way
you called me that.

2409
01:38:30,205 --> 01:38:32,307
* Tracy died

2410
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:37,279
* soon after
a long-fought
civil war *

2411
01:38:40,282 --> 01:38:46,154

his last tear *

2412
01:38:46,188 --> 01:38:47,655
Taxi!

2413
01:38:50,392 --> 01:38:52,327
About time.

2414
01:39:05,673 --> 01:39:07,109
Yes!

2415
01:39:07,142 --> 01:39:08,376
Driver, drive. Drive!

2416
01:39:08,410 --> 01:39:09,511
Where are you going?

2417
01:39:09,544 --> 01:39:10,979
To cali!

2418
01:39:11,013 --> 01:39:12,647
Jfk. Make sure
she gets there safe.

2419
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:14,216
What time's
your flight?

2420
01:39:14,249 --> 01:39:15,350
In an hour.

2421
01:39:15,383 --> 01:39:17,185
Peace.

2422
01:39:17,219 --> 01:39:19,988
Bye, Judy.

2423
01:39:27,529 --> 01:39:30,698
* sometimes it snows

2424
01:39:30,732 --> 01:39:34,036
* in April

2425
01:39:36,738 --> 01:39:38,606
Miss brown.

2426
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,675
He's so sorry
to keep you waiting.

2427
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:44,379
He and your agents
had to work out
a few minor details.

2428
01:39:44,412 --> 01:39:46,648
This is, of course,
not a reading.

2429
01:39:46,681 --> 01:39:48,216
It's more like
a meeting.

2430
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:51,453
He just wants
to go over specifics,
catch up.

2431
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:55,157
Yes, of course, darling.

2432
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:58,360
* all good things,
they say *

2433
01:39:58,393 --> 01:40:01,629
* never last

2434
01:40:04,366 --> 01:40:08,770
* springtime was always
my favorite *

2435
01:40:08,803 --> 01:40:10,772
* time of year

2436
01:40:13,508 --> 01:40:15,743
* a time for lovers

2437
01:40:15,777 --> 01:40:19,514
* holding hands
in the rain *

2438
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:26,788
* now springtime
only reminds me of... *

2439
01:40:26,821 --> 01:40:29,424
* Tracy's tears

2440
01:40:31,493 --> 01:40:33,295
Welcome to Hollywood,
lovely.

2441
01:40:33,328 --> 01:40:35,330
Glad you could make it.

2442
01:40:35,363 --> 01:40:36,531
How have you been, doll?

2443
01:40:36,564 --> 01:40:38,833
I've been fine,
thank you.

2444
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:41,269
So let's have
a look at you.

2445
01:40:41,303 --> 01:40:43,205
Mm-hmm.
Good enough to eat.

2446
01:40:46,308 --> 01:40:48,743
O.K. Here we go.

2447
01:40:48,776 --> 01:40:51,779
Rob, you, uh, you going
to shoot her the line?

2448
01:40:51,813 --> 01:40:53,481
Yeah.

2449
01:40:53,515 --> 01:40:55,350
And when you
answer him, honey,

2450
01:40:55,383 --> 01:40:59,821
I want you to turn
your head... Real slow.

2451
01:40:59,854 --> 01:41:01,656
Then we're going to kiss.

2452
01:41:01,689 --> 01:41:02,757
O.K.

2453
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:05,427
And then...

2454
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:07,429
Well...

2455
01:41:07,462 --> 01:41:08,496
O.K., rob.

2456
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:10,298
Delivery.

2457
01:41:14,869 --> 01:41:16,838
Come in.

2458
01:41:18,806 --> 01:41:21,309
O.K., now we're
going to kiss.

2459
01:41:24,179 --> 01:41:25,547
Good, good.

2460
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:28,183
Now let your top
open up.

2461
01:41:28,216 --> 01:41:29,817
Come on, come on.

2462
01:41:29,851 --> 01:41:31,586
We need to see
your tits, honey.

2463
01:41:31,619 --> 01:41:34,256
Keep the kiss going,
please.

2464
01:41:34,289 --> 01:41:35,690
Rob, help her.

2465
01:41:35,723 --> 01:41:37,725
We don't have all year,
sweetheart.

2466
01:41:38,726 --> 01:41:40,528
Mmm. Mmm.

2467
01:41:40,562 --> 01:41:42,530
Please don't do that.

2468
01:41:42,564 --> 01:41:44,566
Stop.

2469
01:41:44,599 --> 01:41:47,169
Don't do that.

2470
01:41:47,202 --> 01:41:48,770
Rob, that's o.K.

2471
01:41:48,803 --> 01:41:51,906
Look, I've got other ladies
waiting to audition.

2472
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,741
I don't have all day, lovely.

2473
01:41:53,775 --> 01:41:55,743
O.K. Whenever
you're ready,

2474
01:41:55,777 --> 01:41:57,479
Let's see
what you've got.

2475
01:41:57,512 --> 01:41:59,814
The only reason I've
consented to doing this

2476
01:41:59,847 --> 01:42:02,417
Is because I wish
to clear my name,

2477
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:05,620
Not because I care
about what people think,

2478
01:42:05,653 --> 01:42:07,455
But enough is enough.

2479
01:42:07,489 --> 01:42:10,292
And if it helps
some people in the end,

2480
01:42:10,325 --> 01:42:12,360
That's fine, too.

2481
01:42:13,395 --> 01:42:16,198
Some people
call me a freak.

2482
01:42:16,231 --> 01:42:18,200
I hate that word

2483
01:42:18,233 --> 01:42:20,168
Because I don't believe
in labels.

2484
01:42:20,202 --> 01:42:22,337
I consider myself
to be normal,

2485
01:42:22,370 --> 01:42:25,340
Whatever normal is.

2486
01:42:25,373 --> 01:42:27,875
But... What you going
to do, huh?

2487
01:42:29,544 --> 01:42:32,747
That was the deal.

2488
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:34,649
Mm-hmm.

2489
01:42:34,682 --> 01:42:37,219
Good. Very good.

2490
01:42:37,252 --> 01:42:38,820
O.K.

2491
01:42:38,853 --> 01:42:41,356
Ooh, ooh, look, there was
no offense here, o.K.?

2492
01:42:41,389 --> 01:42:43,925
I'm just trying to be free.
No restrictions.

2493
01:42:43,958 --> 01:42:46,628
That's what
the role required.

2494
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:48,230
Hmm.

2495
01:42:48,263 --> 01:42:50,365
No offense taken.

2496
01:42:52,767 --> 01:42:54,536
Oops.

2497
01:42:57,972 --> 01:43:01,643
* but all good things,
they say *

2498
01:43:01,676 --> 01:43:04,679
