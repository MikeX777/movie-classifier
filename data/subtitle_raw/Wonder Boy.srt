[man in French] It's funny
you mention your kid.

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,960
-I had a dream last night.
-[driver] Yeah?

4
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,400
What was it about?

5
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,640
I'll tell you, but you can't tell anyone.

6
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,400
-[driver] You know I wouldn't.
-That's why I'll tell you. I trust you.

7
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,440
I dreamed that…

8
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,160
I saw my biological mother

9
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,120
and biological father in my sleep.

10
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,800
-[driver] Did they have faces?
-I can't remember if they did.

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,720
[driver] Did you remember
when you woke up?

12
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,160
The dream, yes, but not the faces.

13
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,480
I've actually been thinking that I…

14
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,680
It's been on my mind for a while…

15
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,160
-[driver] To know who it is?
-Yeah.

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,800
With every interview, I wonder…
Every time that…

17
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,120
Can you imagine?

18
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,800
Do you think my mom sees them?

19
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,920
When I do all these things on TV,

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,440
do you think she can see

21
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,040
that it's her son?

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,000
Can you sense something like that?

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,880
I'm 30.

24
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,400
Let's say my life expectancy
is between 80 and 90 years,

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,560
100 if things go really well.

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,320
That means I'll spend the next 60 years…

27
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,560

41
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
-[Mom] Hello?
-Hi, Mom. It's Olivier.

42
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,080
-Hi, sweetheart.
-How are you?

43
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,120
-Fine, and you?
-Yes, I'm fine.

44
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,000
Is your desire

45
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,120
stronger than your reason?

46
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,480
-That's something else, you see?
-Yes.

47
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,240
So, you can create an image yourself.

48
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,520
If you liked the image,

49
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,400
perhaps you imagined faces
for these people.

50
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480
-Yeah.
-What was your mother like?

51
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,480
Mixed-race? Dark skin? Light skin?

52
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,920
She had very dark skin.

53
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,880
Very dark. And your father?

54
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,720
Very white.

55
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,840
Yes, that's something we were told…

56
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,040
That's what I can't understand.

57
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,240
Do you have any information
I'm not aware of?

58
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,800
No, that's the only… You can ask Dad.

59
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,960
It's the only thing I know.

60
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,000
I only mention this man
because you're talking about your dream.

61
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,200
You're sure that…
What I mean is that I'd like--

62
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,960
Olivier, if there was anything…

63
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,240
I swear,

64
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
if I knew something,

65
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,680
I would tell you.

66
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,600
[Olivier] I'd like to start
looking into it after the show.

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,720
[Mom] That'll be… Okay.

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,760
I feel like, with everything I've managed
to achieve in the last few years,

69
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,800
it's the right time.

70
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,080
The more I know where I'm going,
the more I need to know where I'm from.

71
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,480
[Olivier] I love the waistline it creates.

72
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,520
[in English] No? You like?

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,400

-[Olivier] Mm-hm.

74
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,760

77

Even if there's only one…

78
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,040
Okay, sure.

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,600
Try to check with him.
Some pairs must be ready.

80
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,880
-No, the pairs arrive tomorrow.
-[woman 2] Okay.

81
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,160

-[woman 2] Tomorrow?

-This is new!
-It's not certain.

84
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,440
[In English] See you tomorrow?

85
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,520
-For once, I won't be alone in the office!
-[In French] Would 14:30 work for you?

86
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,720
-Perfect.
-To relaunch some pieces?

87
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,520
But we'll reschedule lunch.

ten years old and I came with my parents,

by the beauty of Paris,

so, I wanted, today, to celebrate…

through all the files at home…

That's why I feel sad,
because I know he's looking

168

You did what had to be done.
Now we wait for the file.

175
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,320
[in English] No, he's that way.

176
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,720
[in French] Tell him
I went to the children's home

177
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,560
I adopted him from.

178
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,600
There's no one left from when…

179
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,920
And the people who work there now…

180
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,520
They don't even know
the staff from before.

181
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,680
When I got there, I was in tears.

182
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,440
Going through those gates again…

183
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,320
It was hard.

184
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,400
-It was good.
-We did it.

185
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,960
-Not bad.
-Not bad.

186
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,920
-It's a bit too much…
-Yes, it's noisy.

187
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,240
[in English] Open tour!

188
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,680
[crowd chatters]

189
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,440
[inaudible speech]

190
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:53,000
[inaudible speech]

191
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,080
[man on phone in French] I'm listening.

192
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,360
[Olivier] I just wanted to say…

193
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,280
The dinner was good, right?

194
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
[man on phone] Oh, yes. It was good.

195
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,600
-[Olivier] But…
-[man on phone] It was very good.

196
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,240
-[Olivier] Were Grandpa and Grandma happy?
-[man on phone] Yes, they were very happy.

197
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,560
[Olivier] Don't you think
Mom's acting weird?

198
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,280
[man on phone] I know why.

199
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,240
I'll tell you. It's because…

200
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,040
we talked about your adoption
this evening.

201
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,320
The strangest thing about her

202
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,760
is the way she's reacting
to my adoption now.

203
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,240
I don't understand the mixed messages
that I'm getting from you guys.

204
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,960
You said you were sure
there was something, and Mom--

205
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,840
[man on phone] Yes,
I'm sure there's a letter.

206
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,040
But it might not be important,
what's in it, I mean.

207
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,560
They told us there were things
that concerned Olivier,

208
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,160
but not us.

209
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,960
That's important,
because Mom never said that.

210
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,280
That's what I'm saying.

211
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,680
At some point,

212
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,840
she went to see

213
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,520
a hypnotist and a psychic…

214
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,920
-But that's just--
-Yeah, but that's not based on anything.

215
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,080
And this woman,

216
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,280
she's the one who told us,
with her pendulum,

217
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,280
what we wanted to know.

218
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,440
[in English] Whatever.

219
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,640
[in French] The Health and Welfare Office
called me.

220
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,960
They found my file,
and there's something in it.

221
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,400
So…

222
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,400
Great! I'm very happy for you!

223
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,000
What did they tell you to do?

224
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,680
They called me to tell me they found it.

225
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,280
The woman was quite strange.

226
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,040
I asked if there was anything in the file,
and she said yes.

227
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,640
"It might not answer all your questions,

228
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,560
but you'll definitely find some answers."

229
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,080
-[in English] Are you ready for it?
-[in French] I don't know.

230
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,680
I can't…

231
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,480
Seeing pictures in the file
would get to me the most.

232
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,840
[woman on phone] …a satisfaction survey
that you can accept or decline.

233
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,960
The Department of Gironde
thanks you for your participation.

234
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,560
I'm looking for my biological parents.

235
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,280
Someone contacted me to let me know

236
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,680
that my file should be arriving,

237
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,520
and I wanted to know
if you had an idea of when that would be.

238
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,160
[man on phone] Well,
this is the main office for Gironde.

239
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,520
-Your name, please?
-Rousteing, Olivier.

240
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,160
-[woman on phone] Hello?
-Yes, hello.

241
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,080
My name is Olivier Rousteing.

242
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,920
I'm calling, because someone
from your office called me

243
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,600
to let me know that you'd found my file,
and I'd like to know when it will arrive.

244
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,840
-Has it been found or not?
-It seems it has, yes.

245
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,040
Someone called me
to let me know it had been found,

246
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,200
and so I'm calling to find out
when it will be sent… to your office.

247
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,120
-Who called you?
-A woman.

248
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,760
No… A woman, okay.

249
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,640
-You don't have a name?
-No. No name.

250
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,800
A first name?

251
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,680
No first name or last name.

252
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,520
She called and told me
they'd found my file,

253
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,280
and that I had to call back
on the same number

254
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,520
to find out when it would arrive.

255
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,080
So I wanted to know if it had arrived,

256
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,720
and if you had any information.

257
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,080
Okay, I'll look,
but I don't know who called, so…

258
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,000
Can I take your details?

259
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,800
We have it here,
but I'm not sure who's handling it.

260
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,680
You received my file?

261
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,920
I can see that it's been logged,
but I haven't seen it myself.

262
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,320
I don't know who it's been assigned

263
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,000
to read it through with you.

264
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,720
-I'll call you back.
-Okay.

265
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,600
[Olivier] Hello?

266
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,120
-[woman on phone] Mr. Rousteing?
-Yes?

267
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,440
I'm calling you back as we discussed.

268
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,800
Listen… After checking, it turns out
I was wrong. It hasn't arrived.

269
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,080
-It's been requested from the archives.
-Okay.

270
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,920
So, we're waiting

271
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,920
to hear back from the archives.

272
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,840
Okay.

273
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,440
As soon as we have the file,

274
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,160
we'll send you a letter

275
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,800
indicating the staff members available
to read through the file with you.

276
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,760
Okay.

277
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,160
We'll have to wait.

278
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,680
Do you know when it might arrive?

279
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,560
We don't know that.

280
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,680
We can't control the delay, sir.

281
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,080
[chattering voices]

282
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,040
-[in English] Balmain VS. Yeah!
-Yeah!

283
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,720
Okay, do it, do it.

284
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,920
But do it seriously!

285
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,720
Yeah. Do it, do it!

286
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,560
Hi, guys. Today's the VS and Balmain show
all together.

287
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,280
…like a dream. And

288
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,080
I kind of feel emotional about it,
but it's gonna be amazing.

289
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,120
-Okay!
-Thank you, Cosmo. Love you guys!

290
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,400
Thank you very much.

291
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,120
[upbeat music playing]

292
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,840
[man] What do you wanna see?

293
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,760
-[man] Like something with culture--
-[Olivier] Something really chill.

294
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,920
We can just, like, relax
and something like… You know?

295
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,120
What about this? Like, one thing…

296
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,360
-Like, this is an antique market.
-This is nice.

297
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,960
Like something more modern.
Where young people hang out.

298
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,240
It's so cold.

299
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,480
-It's freezing.
-Hm?

300
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,480
It's freezing.

301
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,200
[Olivier] Are we still, in 2017,

302
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,320
telling me
that my casting is really diverse?

303
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,360
Of course it's diverse,
but it's actually normal.

304
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,040
You know?
And that's what I think is sad, is that

305
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,520
my casting is much more different
than the others.

306
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,960
I think what should be the question
is to the others

307
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,720
and say,
"Why your casting is not diverse?"

308
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,600
You know what I mean?
I think we should switch the question.

309
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,720
Because my casting is normal.

310
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,320
My casting is just a reflection
of what's in the world today.

311
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,680
Maybe the casting
of some other fashion shows are wrong.

312
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,480
[Olivier in French] I'm afraid to leave,
because I'm more afraid of going home.

313
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,560
I've realized that, whenever I travel,

314
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,280
a sense of solitude starts to grow in me
and intensifies when I get home.

315
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,920
The people in the lobby say,

316
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,840
"I'm going to see my boyfriend,
my family, my children."

317
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,040
And I ask myself what I'm going to do.

318
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,320
I'm going to lock myself in my office
to continue my collections.

319
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,400
It's interesting when you think about it.

320
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,720
All that people see of me
is what I've created myself,

321
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,520
and I think I got a bit lost

322
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,280
in…

323
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,880
In this deep solitude, really.

324
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,480
What I'm most scared of

325
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,040
is that I'm not that old

326
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,080
and now, when I'm supposed to have fun,
I'm not enjoying myself.

327
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
I'm constantly in control.

328
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,320
I'd like to say,
"I'm going home this weekend."

329
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,760
"I'm going home Thursday morning at six

330
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,120
and someone will be waiting."
When, in fact…

331
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,040
Mohammed is waiting for me.

332
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,160
Who am I doing it for?

333
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,120
When your parents don't want you,
you wonder what you're doing here.

334
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,960
I realize I'm actually scared
about this film ending.

335
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,400
What will the last scene be?

336
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,920
Will my life just go on like before?

337
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,800
[Olivier in English] Now, girls,
start moving.

338
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
Yeah, okay. Now start to just…

339
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,560
[laughter]

340
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,200
[In French] It's going too fast.

341
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,160
At least, I…

342
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,600
At least I had airbags in the back.

343
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,800
Yes, hello?

344
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,800
[Woman on phone] We've received your file.

345
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,080
-Are you able to come to Bordeaux?
-Absolutely.

346
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,760
Let me know a time, and I'll come.

347
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,760
I don't know…

348
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,280
We have to decide together.

349
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,360
-I don't want to impose a date.
-No, but…

350
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,960
What I mean is
I want to see my file as soon as possible.

351
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,000
Will you be coming
for the Christmas holidays?

352
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,920
Absolutely.

353
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,800
-When will you arrive?
-I actually arrive on the 24th.

354
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,040
I'm arriving very late.

355
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,840
So, you arrive on the 24th…

356
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,000
And how long are you staying?

357
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,000
Until the 26th.

358
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,280
I'm very scared my file will be empty.

359
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,240
In your file, you have

360
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,240
your data.

361
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,720
The document completed
when your birth mother handed you over.

362
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,240
So there's nothing.

363
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,120
What would you call nothing?

364
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,920
I won't find out the identity
of my biological mother.

365
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,120
Yes, you will. In the document…

366
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,080
Well, you'll see.

367
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,840
But, yes,
there is information on your mother.

368
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,040
It might not end up
being everything you'd hoped,

369
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,480
but we can't call it nothing.

370
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,280
Okay. Is there any information
on my biological father?

371
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,840
There's no identity,
but there is some information.

372
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,880
Okay.

373
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,160
-You'll see for yourself.
-Of course.

374
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,160
It's hard to say in advance
where it will lead you. We don't know.

375
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,600
Okay. Thank you very much.

376
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,680
-Thank you. See you Friday.
-Yes, see you on the 22nd.

377
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,760
-[Olivier] Hello.
-[woman] Hello.

378
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,040
-I'm Mrs. Lamothe.
-[Olivier] Pleased to meet you.

379
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,280
[Mrs. Lamothe] Take a seat… here.

380
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,240
Okay…

381
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,160
-You've come a long way.
-Yes.

382
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,720
-Not too tiring?
-No, I'm okay.

383
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,280
You're okay? Do you feel ready?

384
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,040
I don't know.

385
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,360
Do you ever actually feel ready?

386
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,240
Okay. We'll take it slow.

387
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,480
So, here we go.

388
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,840
You'll be able… to read through your file.

389
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,640
This is a process you began

390
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,920
several years ago.

391
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,960
Yes, I came when I was young.
I was 16, I think.

392
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,440
-In 2001, I think?
-Yeah.

393
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,640
And… when I saw that the last name
I used wasn't my birth name,

394
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,880
my family name,

395
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,080
I couldn't get over it.

396
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
I just couldn't imagine that

397
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,960
there was another Olivier
before Olivier Rousteing.

398
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,920
-So, yeah.
-Okay.

399
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,960
After you sent this letter to our office,

400
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,760
you didn't then have a meeting

401
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,280
-with anyone… to discuss it?
-No.

402
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,160
So this is your first time
going through this process.

403
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,800
-Okay.
-But, I mean, it's…

404
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,560
I wanted to do it before,
but I didn't feel ready.

405
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,800
I'm not sure you can ever be ready.

406
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,720
But I really want to find out, so…

407
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,440
Do you have any particular expectations?

408
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,600
My first hope is to see…
what my parents look like.

409
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,880
But that won't happen today.

410
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,160
To understand where I'm from. My origins.

411
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,280
Because I grew up without really…

412
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,600
Without really knowing

413
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,560
why my skin is this color.

414
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,480
Um, I also want to know why…
I was given up for adoption.

415
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,160
So I hope…

416
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,000
[Mrs. Lamothe] We don't know

417
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,440
if it was your mother who named you

418
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,080
or if the maternity staff
gave you your name.

419
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,080
You were born at Pellegrin Hospital.

420
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,520
No paternity was acknowledged.

421
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,800
The baby was a natural child.

422
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,120
That means you were born out of wedlock,

423
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,040
outside of a legitimate union.

424
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
So…

425
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,040
the different handwriting might mean

426
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,400
that your mother filled some of it in.

427
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,120
Okay?
We can try to find out who filled in--

428
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,440
There are spelling mistakes.

429
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,360
[Mrs. Lamothe] There are
spelling mistakes, but, well…

430
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,440
-She must have been young.
-[Mrs. Lamothe] Indeed.

431
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,880
So… perhaps she filled in part of this.

432
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,840
-So--
-That's a child's handwriting.

433
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,680
[Mrs. Lamothe] She was Catholic,
and she wrote like a young child, yes.

434
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,480
"Was he baptized? No."

435
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,040
"Place of birth: Pellegrin Hospital."

436
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,840
"State of health of the infant: Good."

437
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,920
It wasn't necessarily your mother
who filled this in.

438
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,880
-It must have been done later.
-Mm-hm.

439
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,400
You were born a little prematurely.

440
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,760
-[sniffs] Ah! Cool.
-Yes.

441
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,880
You were fed with a bottle.
Again, she didn't fill that in.

442
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,320
Next… So…

443
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,640
As for information on your birth mother…

444
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,160
Here, I've covered up

445
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,560
the day and month of birth.

446
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,080
Those are identifying elements
that we can't…

447
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,120
At your current stage,
we can't share that information with you.

448
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,080
Oh, really?

449
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,800
[Mrs. Lamothe] However,
she was born in 1970--

450
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,440
-Hold on. In 1970, so--
-[Mrs. Lamothe] In Djibouti.

451
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,200
-You were--
-She was 15?

452
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,360
[Mrs. Lamothe] She was 15.

453
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,040
[he exhales]

454
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,200
[Mrs. Lamothe] Yes, she was 15.

455
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,600
[he sniffs]

456
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,120
That's awful!

457
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,640
[he gasps]

458
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,000
[Mrs. Lamothe] You didn't think
she was so young?

459
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,640
[he sobs]

460
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,920
That's terrible!

461
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,600
What seems terrible to you?

462
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,120
Fifteen, I mean…

463
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,240
-She was so young!
-[Mrs. Lamothe] Yes.

464
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,200
Yes, but you know, at 15…

465
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,960
It is very young. That's true.

466
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,320
How old did you think she was?

467
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,520
-You knew she was very young.
-Yes, but…

468
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,760
[Mrs. Lamothe] You weren't imagining
a teenager.

469
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,000
[he sniffs]

470
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,520
No.

471
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,680
[Mrs. Lamothe] So the biological father
was 25.

472
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,840
Your mother, 15 and a half years old.

473
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,480
Big age gap.

474
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,280
[Mrs. Lamothe] Yes.
She got pregnant before she was 15.

475
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,240
But we don't know--

476
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,640
It's not indicated,
but, if she had agreed to disclose it,

477
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,200
she could have indicated

478
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,360
whether it was a romantic
or non-consensual relationship.

479
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,400
-But… it doesn't say.
-[he sniffs]

480
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,680
-Okay.
-He was a young Ethiopian man.

481
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,040
That tells you something else
about your roots.

482
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,320
-He was unemployed.
-Mm-hm.

483
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,760
[Mrs. Lamothe] That's all there is.

484
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,120
"Has she been made aware
that registration as a ward of the state

485
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,360
is only definitive after three months,

486
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,920
and that she can request the child
be returned to her before then? Yes."

487
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,680
"Does the mother seem attached
to the child,

488
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,800
and are there grounds to believe
she may request they be reunited?"

489
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,440
There's no information provided here.
As you'll see below,

490
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,200
she didn't ask…

491
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,120
She didn't try…
to establish a relationship.

492
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,880
"Does the mother wish to remain anonymous

493
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,560
for the child's entire life? Yes."

494
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,240
So, this here is really what allows us…

495
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,280
to consider this file
a request for anonymity on her part.

496
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,720
That's why I covered up
certain pieces of information.

497
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,880
Because she specifies
"for the child's entire life."

498
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,360
That said, in light of the current law,

499
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,200
we might be able to see
if she'll reconsider this decision,

500
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,320
and ask her if, now,

501
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,920
she is in a position
to review this decision,

502
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,800
and if she wishes…

503
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,000
And if you do too, of course.
If you both wish to take this step.

504
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,840
You have to make the request.

505
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,840
"She arrived in France in July

506
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,800
with her sisters and brother,

507
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,160
all younger than her…"

508
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,360
So she was the eldest.

509
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,600
"…and her mother, to settle in Bordeaux,
where her uncle lives."

510
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,760
"Her parents are separated."

511
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,360
"The mother and uncle know…"
About the pregnancy, that is.

512
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,160
"…but not her siblings,
and she does not want them to."

513
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,720
She hid her pregnancy
from her brothers and sisters.

514
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,200
"She does not wish to discuss the father,

515
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,120
whom she barely knew, it seems."

516
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,320
"She was in seventh grade in Djibouti."

517
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,160
"She is going to a private
vocational college to study IT."

518
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,480
"She had a C-section

519
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,520
since her pelvis was too narrow."

520
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,160
"She did not see the child."

521
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,760
So the birth was…

522
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,840
-Not easy.
-[Mrs. Lamothe] Not easy.

523
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,040
A C-section, because she was young,

524
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,760
and her build was probably

525
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,960
very slim, a little bit like you. So…

526
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,120
Here's what she was able to write
about her reasons.

527
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,240
"I'd like to continue my studies

528
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,560
without looking after
or thinking about a child."

529
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,400
She must have written that.
There's a mistake here too.

530
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,880
"Mother of Somalian origin."

531
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,560
So…

532
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,920
you are of Somalian and Ethiopian origin.

533
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,640
-Okay. Wow.
-There you go.

534
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,160
When you're adopted, well, given up…

535
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,800
Like many people, you make up stories,

536
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,000
especially being a person of color
in a white family.

537
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,760
I imagined many things.

538
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,080
But…

539
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,800
some are dreams and some are nightmares.

540
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,480
What I learned today is more…

541
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,080
It's a pretty sad story.

542
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,400
Well, it could have been
a real love story.

543
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,600
We just don't know.

544
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,720
If it was a love story,

545
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,160
she'd have spoken about it.

546
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,000
Not necessarily.

547
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,520
[gentle piano music plays]

548
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,400
[indistinct conversation]

549
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,280
My grandson.

550
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,600
Isn't he beautiful!

551
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,280
Look at him later on, older.

552
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,680
Was your dad there?

553
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,680
No, no one knows.

554
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,840
-Your mom doesn't know?
-No. No one.

555
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,680
Not even your mom! Goodness.

556
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,480
-So, you--
-It has to be hush-hush.

557
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,440
-Yes, hush-hush.
-Hush-hush!

558
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,000
[laughter]

559
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,000
I don't want them to know, because then,

560
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,040
I would've had to go see them,
and I don't have time.

561
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,640
-Oh, okay then.
-I'm going back to Paris.

562
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,200
I'm not sharing you.

563
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,400
-I can have you to myself.
-All for him!

564
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,520
From Sunday, you're going to have
45,000 people here, no?

565
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,600
No!

566
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,920
Eighteen or 20.

567
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,480
Yeah, it's not…

568
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,360
-You know a lot of them.
-And a lot I don't know!

569
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,160
Not many!

570
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,240
I don't know who he is! A singer…

571
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,400
-[Olivier] Yeah!
-It's…

572
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,800
-[Olivier] Maître Gims.
-Maître Gims, that's it!

573
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,720
I was trying to get it.

574
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,720
[Grandmother] We can't sit together
on the armchair.

575
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,000
No.

576
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,880
He fell asleep!

577
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,840
Scooch over!

578
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,920
Sit down next to me.

579
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,120
"Grandma, I'm coming
to the supermarket with you!"

580
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,880
He was this big.

581
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,240
His mother would get up
and she'd say, "He's gone!"

582
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,080
Oh man…

583
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,520
[he sighs]

584
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,800
Yeah…

585
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,600
-I have a headache.
-You do?

586
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,720
-I just take one?
-Yes.

587
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,440
-If you can.
-What did you give me?

588
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,840
-Paracetamol.
-Is that okay?

589
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,760
Yes! It's…

590
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,200
[she chuckles]
I'm not trying to poison you!

591
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,400
Enjoy the cake,

592
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
and find a good spot for the photo.

593
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,680
Take it with you. It's not for you?

594
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
No, it's for you!

595
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,680
Grandpa will eat it
in the morning or tonight.

596
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,960
[Olivier] It's crazy,
because I've always dreamed…

597
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,480
of having this in front of me…

598
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,760
but I never knew…

599
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,320
I always thought I'd be

600
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,880
so strong that I'd control my emotions,

601
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,640
that I'd be able to anticipate,
whatever the answers were,

602
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,440
and now, I feel like I'm…

603
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,080
I don't feel free…

604
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,600
Yet.

605
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,760
I have to look in the mirror,
and say I'm from this continent,

606
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,240
these countries…

607
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,840
But there are no pictures.

608
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,640
One thing touched me today
that felt really… nice.

609
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,920
It's really dumb.

610
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,320
She said my mother was very slim
and that, ultimately,

611
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,160
unfortunately for her,
her youth and her size

612
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,160
prevented her from…
actually giving birth to me.

613
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,960
But it's the first time
I've ever been told I look like someone.

614
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,160
Actually… when I opened it, I just wanted
to take her in my arms and say,

615
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,360
"I understand you. It'll be over soon."

616
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,120
"It's just a fucking dream."

617
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,480
"You'll wake up, and it'll be over."

618
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,440
Then I said to myself…

619
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,120
maybe one day she'll see this film.

620
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,800
-Suzanne?
-[woman] Can you come help us? Yes?

621
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,760
[man] Is it okay?

622
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,360
Yes, but they'll put that…

623
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,960
-Yes, you're right.
-It should…

624
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,040
[woman] It's going to be like that
afterwards.

625
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,480
There's also a button to fasten it.

626
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,920
[she laughs]

627
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,920
-I was like, "Okay, perfect!"
-[woman] I'm going to take it.

628
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,800
-[man] Where do I put the embroidery?
-We're shooting upstairs.

629
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,840
[indistinct chatter]

630
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,280
No.

631
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,840
[Olivier] I'm calling because I received
a call from Mrs. Lamothe.

632
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,000
It's Olivier Rousteing.

633
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,360
I was wondering… if I could talk to her.

634
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,920
[man on phone] Of course.
I'll put you through.

635
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,120
Children's Services?

636
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,080
-Yes, please.
-Okay. I'll connect you.

638
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,560
-[Olivier] Hello. Happy New Year!
-[Mrs. Lamothe] To you too!

639
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,800
Yes, it was quite
an unusual end to the year.

640
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,240
I wanted to thank you again
for the support that

641
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,680
you gave me.

642
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,120
It meant a lot.

643
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,640
I thought long and hard

644
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,240
after our conversation,

645
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,640
and I'm ready to take
the next step towards finding her.

646
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,200
Okay.

647
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,680
I'll try…

648
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,880
This weekend,
I'll fill in the form you gave me.

649
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,720
Do I send it to you?
Who should I send it to?

650
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,280
Send it directly to the National Council
for Accessing Personal Origins in Paris.

651
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,200
-Yes.
-And to save time,

652
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,520
I'll send… an email

653
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,760
to Mrs. Anat, the…

654
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,920
She runs the department

655
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,680
that deals with the files.

656
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,560
We work with her a lot.

657
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,480
I'll let her know in advance,
and send her the documents right away.

658
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,880
We'll save time that way.

659
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,440
If I send it to her directly…

660
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,480
Okay.

661
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,440
…then they can start the investigation.

662
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,000
It can take some time.

663
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,040
Yes, I imagine.

664
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,520
But if your birth mother
is still in France,

665
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,880
she might still be in Gironde,
or in another region.

666
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,200
Or she could no longer be with us.

667
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,240
Yes, sure, but…

668
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,480
that can be verified very quickly.

669
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,680
I'll take care of things on my end,
and keep you updated if there's any news.

670
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,960
No problem. I'm available anytime.

671
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,680
Thanks again, Mrs. Lamothe.

672
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,560
-Bye. Have a good day.
-You're welcome. Bye.

673
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,520
All good?

674
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,120
[indistinct chatter]

675
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,840
[man] That's the boy
who had the missing look.

676
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,440
I mean, I know it was bad,

677
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,480
and he was extremely nervous, but…

678
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,480
You know? We were lucky, we could say.

679
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,720
Have you spoken to your mom
since her birthday?

680
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,520
On the phone?

681
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,600
No…
Well, we spoke for two or three seconds.

682
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,160
[man] She just sent a text.

683
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,840
She says to have a good show
and enjoy blowing off steam tonight.

684
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,200
I think she misses you.

685
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,840
[dramatic music plays]

686
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:18,760
[applause]

687
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,680
-[in English] You liked it?
-I loved it. It felt like…

688
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,440
-Blade Runner, future and bold.
-That was it. Mad Max.

689
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,160
-[Orlando] Mad Max, all of it. I loved it.
-[Olivier] Cool!

690
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,840
[in French] Hi! Happy New Year!

691
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,640
-To you too.
-Thank you.

692
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,160
-Welcome.
-[man] This is my first Balmain show.

693
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,560
-Really?
-[man] These boys are quite extravagant.

694
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,400
Yes, they're very extravagant. It's…

695
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,080
We love adding masculinity
to our womens wear.

696
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,880
Women wearing men's jackets.

697
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,760
But you never hear
about men also wearing clothes

698
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,000
translated by the codes of femininity.
That's what interested me.

699
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,920
[man in English] I mean…

700
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,560
[Olivier In French] "Father married
or unmarried to mother. Unmarried."

701
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,200
"Date and place of birth, nationality:
25 years old, Ethiopian."

702
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,120
"Profession: Unemployed."

703
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,360
"Current residence." Nothing.

704
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,000
"Health." Nothing.
"Other information." Nothing.

705
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,520
[man] It's also possible
she just didn't want

706
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,000
to provide the information.

707
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,840
"She does not wish to discuss the father,
whom she barely knew, it seems."

708
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,040
The only thing…

709
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,640
The only important thing to know

710
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,480
is if she was with him willingly.

711
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,080
That's what you want to know.

712
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,120
[in English] Anyway, this is the letter.

713
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,080
And we just need to send.

714
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,960
[man] Okay.

715
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,440
[Olivier] I will give you the address.

716
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,120
[Olivier in French] I discovered
that my biological mother was 14

717
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,440
and my biological father was 25.

718
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,040
That she was from Somalia
and he was from Ethiopia.

719
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,480
Why should I feel better?
Because I've pinned down the origins

720
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,600
of my facial features?

721
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,080
Absolutely not.

722
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,240
I want to meet her to understand why

723
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,600
she brought me into the world
and rejected me.

724
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,120
Then I'd have a new answer.

725
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,960
Will it be enough for me?

726
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,440
I'm so furious, and…

727
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,920
I mean, really furious.

728
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,080
And yet, I'm thankful,
since I wouldn't be here otherwise.

729
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,920
But when you've been abandoned,

730
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,760
it gives you this uncontrollable,
raging zeal for life.

731
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,560
And the problem, when you have this zeal,

732
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,640
and you are so hard on yourself,

733
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,840
is that

734
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,320
it gradually becomes a prison of anger.

735
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,120
If I have to be honest,
I hate her for who I am,

736
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,880
because I am always unsatisfied.

737
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,320
Finally, what I dreamed of as a kid,
to know where I come from,

738
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,440
is no longer enough today,
now that I'm in my thirties.

739
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,840
Because I want to know

740
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,560
why, and when I've understood why,

741
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,880
I'll want to know my biological father,

742
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,240
who might explain, if I get to meet him.

743
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,480
Then, finally, it won't be enough,
because, when he's told me why,

744
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,840
I won't be happy.
I'll say, "Why did you make this choice?

745
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,360
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that to her?"

746
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,840
Now, I think I'm…

747
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,280
unable to receive a good answer.

748
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,120
I'm not able to appreciate the answers.

749
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,600
As long as I don't know who I am,

750
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,640
I can't love myself.

751
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,880
[trainer] Knee.

752
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,960
One, two.

753
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,720
One.

754
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,640
-You're exhausting me.
-Skipping rope next.

755
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,640
[trainer] Twenty seconds.

756
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,480
I'm dead.

757
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,120
[trainer] It's just the start.

758
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,040
-[Olivier] Go easy.
-As usual.

759
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,040
[Olivier] No, I'm telling you go easy,
because I don't want to be…

760
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,120
Don't forget I have a show, my dear.

761
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,880
Don't push me, or I'll destroy you.

762
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,000
[trainer] One more minute.

763
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,480
Four, three, two, one, and rest.

764
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,480
I hate that.

765
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,240
I really hate that.

766
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,240
[Olivier] Our skirts are 38 cm.

767
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,240
It would be nice to have them
10 cm. higher at the waist

768
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,360
and 10 cm. longer.

769
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,760
Put that in the side seam here,
and in the yoke, here.

770
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,120
-Okay?
-Yeah.

771
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,400
It's real yellow.
It doesn't exist in white.

772
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,120
-So we wanted to check if you liked it.
-Yeah, it's fine.

773
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,280
This, no.

774
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,240
That could look good.

775
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,120
All in nude draped tulle?

776
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,800
No, all in my black draped tulle

777
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,720
on a base of nude tulle.

778
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,560
It's between bougainvillea and bubblegum.

779
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,760
Let's get rid of it.

780
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,480
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

[sewing machine clacks]

782
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,120
[Olivier] Maybe it needs to be shorter?

783
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,720
It's a bit short, no?

784
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,120
Okay.

Claire,
it's great having long dresses this year.

788
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,240
-She just has to avoid stepping on…
-On the train.

789
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,640
[Olivier] They're so long!

790
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,200
You know what happened this morning?

791
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,280
-[driver] What?
-I went… I was coming out of

792
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,320
the gym, the boxing gym, and

793
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,040
there was a guy in the changing room…

794
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,400
who I like, and he said hello to me.

795
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,240
[driver] Mm-hm.

796
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,880
You don't give a shit,
but I'm telling you anyway.

797
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,240
[driver] Do you see him
every day at the gym?

798
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,400
No, but when I do,
he puts a huge smile on my face.

799
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,640
Today I saw him, and he said hi.

800
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,000
[driver] It's a good start!
Why'd you never say hi before?

801
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,040
I'm not going to say hello. Are you nuts?

802
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,400
[driver] You can say hello.

803
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,200
No way! Are you crazy?
He'd think I'm flirting with him.

804
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,200
[driver] I say hi to lots of people.

805
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,160
You flirt with everyone.

806
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,240
-You're not ashamed?
-No.

807
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,040
[Olivier in English] Shame on you,
Mohammed.

808
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,800

Oh my God!
That was pretty chill at the end, no?

824
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,080
That was great!

[cheering]

827
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,000
[Olivier in French] When I started,
people would applaud.

828
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,880
Today, they don't applaud anymore.

829
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,520
Now, the applause
is an Instagram post, a like.

830
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,160
It's interesting.

831
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,720
Seven years ago, it was the applause
and the noise in the room.

832
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,200
Now, it's more the number of flashes…
in the room.

833
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,760
Today, I felt those flashes.

834
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,840
It was nice.

835
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,080
In one interview, I was asked,

836
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,920
"Why the grandeur every time?

837
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,560
City hall, Paris, the opera house?"

838
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,440
Actually, I've always wanted to affirm…

839
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,080
my nationality,

840
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,160
my "passport," so to speak,

841
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,160
because I was scared
of not being French enough.

842
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,960
But, in the end, I am French now.

It's from before we went

01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,080
[parents chuckle]

862
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,000
[Olivier sniffs]

863
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,200
[Mom] I wrote it all out for you there.

864
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,680
There's a message from Benoît and Marie.

865
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,840
You're really nasty, you know that?

866
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,080
[Olivier laughs and cries]

867
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,680
This is crazy.

868
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,800
There's this smell

869
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,200
of the paper that hasn't been opened
in 30 years, and you know

870
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,200
that the last person to touch it

871
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,160
was this woman, so…

872
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,400
It's quite a powerful…

873
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,440
emotion.

874
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,880
There are all the letters

875
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,120
that you guys sent.

876
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,040
-[Mom] We sent letters?
-Yes.

877
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:21,200
There's a short letter saying the period--

878
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,280
-Of adjustment.
-Yes, the adjustment period was over.

879
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,000
You sent that letter to tell her

880
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,800
that I had started to smile

881
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,440
and walk a little bit

882
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,400
and that the family had accepted me,
and I was with my grandparents.

883
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,520
There was your letter
saying you really wanted me to stay.

884
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,840
-It's…
-Of course!

885
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,400
[woman on phone] I understand
that you're waiting to hear something,

886
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,360
but, at the same time,

887
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,080
we have to see what is most relevant

888
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:56,680
so that you have the best chances

889
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,000
of succeeding in this process.

890
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:03,480
This is the kind of process
that can't be rushed.

891
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:08,160
Will someone contact me if they find her

892
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,360
or only if she gives her consent?

893
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,920
Oh, no, they contact you before.

894
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,200
The Council for Personal Data
doesn't handle the whole process.

895
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:21,040
They conduct the investigation
to find her.

896
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,480
The process is broken down into steps,

897
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:27,760
both on your mother's side and yours.

898
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,400
You're in it together.

899
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:33,240
You'll receive feedback
after every step taken on her part.

900
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,200
When she's been contacted,
if she responds or not,

901
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,280
what she says and so on.

902
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,000
This is the case for you too.
You're both informed.

903
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,080
-[Olivier] Mohammed?
-Yeah?

904
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,640
[Olivier] I did something last night.

905
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:56,320
I signed up to use a dating app.

906
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,080
-[Mohammed] Which one? Meetic?
-Come on. Meetic?

907
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,720
Look at me.
You think I'm going to go on Meetic?

908
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,600
I joined Adopteunmec.com.

909
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,520
No, I'm joking.

910
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,280
[Mohammed] It seems to work.

911
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,720
No, so I actually signed up

912
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,440
to use this crazy app

913
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,480
that's actually linked directly
to your Instagram.

914
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:22,160
It's only people
who are looking for love or friendship,

915
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,880
but who are often very well-known.

916
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,240
And so you actually have to wait for…

917
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:30,600
Registration takes a little bit of time,

918
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,240
while they check your profile,
then they accept you.

919
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,080
Still no hearts for me.

920
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,840
[Mohammed] It hasn't even been 24 hours.

921
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,000
-It'll happen.
-And if it doesn't?

922
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,480
[Mohammed] If it doesn't happen,

923
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,520
it will one day or another.

924
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,360
Apps always work.

925
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,360
I don't know, Momo.

926
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,720
[Mohammed] You don't give yourself
enough time.

927
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,040
-Really?
-[Mohammed] Yes.

928
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,520
It's not because of your work, but…

929
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,560
Maybe you should

930
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,880
fit in a day when…

931
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,120
At least one day a week
when you do something else.

932
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,280
I know you love your work, that it's…

933
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:25,520
It's what you love to do,
but it takes up all your time.

934
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:30,280
Does your contract say,
"Chauffeur and shrink," or what?

935
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,960
[sirens wailing]

936
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:16,560
[indistinct chatter]

937
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,800
[woman in English] There you go!
Now we're getting somewhere.

938
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,360
-[Olivier] Now we talk.
-Yeah.

939
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,080
Yeah, now it's starting to fit.

940
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:27,880
There they go.

941
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:31,880
Good?

942
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,680
-Fave.
-[in French] Grab a tape measure,

943
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,120
and we'll see
exactly how much needs to go.

944
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,240
Give me a pin.

945
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,280
[in English] There's a bag behind you.

946
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,440
Shall I try the next one? I love this one.

947
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,560
[man] It's so good.

948
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,840
[Jennifer Lopez] When it has
a bit of light on it, it's gonna be nice.

949
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,560
It won't look like a rug. It'll look like…

950
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,920
When it has a little bit
of the beads in it, the black beads,

951
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,880
yeah, it won't look like a rug.

952
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,760
[woman in French] I need to know what time
the pieces have to be ready tomorrow.

953
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,600
Because, depending on whether
she wants her fitting extra early,

954
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:19,840
we have to work out
who's sleeping tonight, who isn't…

955
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,440
How to organize the work.

956
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,000
[in English] Do we have a crown?

957
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:27,280
Don't ask us!
This crown is stuck in customs.

958
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,360
But you already have
the cross of the queen here.

959
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,280
Yes.

960
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,000
Yeah, this is it!

961
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,720
-Maybe we will…
-Sometimes.

962
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,080
Depends on how I feel.

963
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,720
Yeah, it's beautiful.

964
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,160
-Happy?
-[Olivier] Yeah.

965
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,840
-Are you happy?
-Very.

966
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,240
…with two more people.

967
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:50,960
Are you able to work non-stop
between now and tomorrow noon?

968
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,000
I have to go to a class
and come right back.

969
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,000
-[woman 1] Until 11 a.m.?
-Yeah.

970
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:59,240
[woman 1] Straight through till tomorrow?
You feel you can physically manage that?

971
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,240
You think you can manage that
without any sleep?

972
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,720
-[woman 2] Oh, yeah.
-Yeah? Okay, cool.

973
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,320
As soon as I'm done with this,
I can move to a different…

974
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,160
If you keep giving me coffee.

975
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,680
I can get you… I can get you
as much coffee as you want.

976
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,480
[serene music plays]

977
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,920
[music becomes more upbeat]

978
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:21,040
[Olivier in French] You're going to
blow away in this wind.

979
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,440
She looks divine.

980
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:31,760
It's stunning.

981
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,440
It's really stunning.

982
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,400
[on phone] Hello,
this is Sophie Anat here,

983
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,840
from CNAOP, the National Council
for Accessing Personal Origins.

984
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:20,480
I was just calling to update you
on the progress of your file.

985
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,040
So, if you are available,

986
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:28,080
call me back on my direct line
at the number displayed.

987
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,800
Thank you. Speak to you soon. Bye.

988
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:54,280
[woman] As I told you, we were waiting
to hear from the private pension office.

989
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:57,520
I only received a reply on…

990
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,520
-July 17th, I think.
-[Olivier] Okay.

991
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,720
Uh…

992
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,560
They found a corresponding address.

993
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,400
I also heard back

994
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:13,120
from the health insurance office
two days later.

995
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,560
They also found a corresponding address,
and it's the same.

996
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:18,440
That's where we are.

997
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,720
But that means
we're talking about an address--

998
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:22,720
[woman] In France.

999
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,920
-Wow.
-[woman] That's what I'm saying.

1000
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,120
But…

1001
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:35,560
we really have to…
I mean, I'd really like to get across…

1002
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,880
that nothing is certain.

1003
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,720
No, it's crazy.

1004
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,920
But it's still something positive,

1005
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,040
this discovery about the address, because,

1006
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,560
on the face of it,

1007
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:53,440
she's not on the other side of the world.

1008
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:54,840
That was unexpected.

1009
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,520
You have her first and last names?

1010
01:12:59,040 --> 01:12:59,960
[woman] Of course.

1011
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,160
Which I can't have, obviously.

1012
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,560
-Nope.
-That's right.

1013
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,880
What's the origin of her names?

1014
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,920
Can you tell?

1015
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,200
I can't answer questions about that.

1016
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,400
-I'm wondering if they sound foreign.
-[woman] I can imagine.

1017
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,800
Is it a… I mean,
could it be a French name?

1018
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,640
[woman] Yes.

1019
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,000
-Okay.
-[woman] It's--

1020
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:26,560
I mean, it's not at all…
It's not extraordinary or anything.

1021
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:29,720
-Or especially unusual.
-Okay.

1022
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,880
You know so much more than me.
It's horrible.

1023
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,520
Do people address their parents
formally or informally when they meet?

1024
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,560
There's no rule.

1025
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,400
There's no rule.
Each person decides for themselves.

1026
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,200
Everyone is free to choose

1027
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,760
depending on what they experience or feel.

1028
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,240
Even what you call them.

1029
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,560
When people…

1030
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,640
We might suggest, for example,

1031
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,960
that people write a letter

1032
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,240
to the biological parent,
if they agree to it.

1033
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,280
-That they exchange letters.
-Of course.

1034
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,880
For letters,

1035
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,760
you write to the person
according to how you see them,

1036
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:10,760
how you feel.

1037
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:14,320
You can write "Mrs." and her last name,
you can write "Mom"…

1038
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,760
It's not straightforward. And…

1039
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,680
At the same time, it speaks volumes.

1040
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,560
You have to say things as you feel them.

1041
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:25,000
Which part of France does she live in?
Can't I know that either?

1042
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,600
-[woman] She lives in the Southwest.
-Okay.

1043
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,120
That's big.

1044
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,160
You know,
you could tell me the town. I mean…

1045
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:40,120
I'm sure a lot of people live there.
Yeah, okay.

1046
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:41,880
Uh…

1047
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:45,720
Would you like to write…

1048
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,920
-Yes.
-[woman] …to her?

1049
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,760
I suggest you do that.

1050
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:53,240
But I can't guarantee I'll be able to…

1051
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,960
I'll explain the circumstances in which

1052
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,400
I can give her the message.

1053
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:02,560
If I manage to reach her on the telephone,

1054
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,400
I'll tell her about you,
what you're hoping for,

1055
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,920
our conversations, all that.

1056
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,480
-But those are just my words.
-Of course.

1057
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,920
What I can do is tell her,

1058
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,160
"Olivier has written you a letter."

1059
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,560
"Would you permit me to read it to you

1060
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,520
and then forward it to you?"

1061
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,880
-Reading it to her first.
-That would be amazing.

1062
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,400
-[woman] I've had people say no before.
-Okay.

1063
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,680
[woman] People who say,
"No, I don't want that,"

1064
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,560
because then it makes you too real.

1065
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,000
Mm. Yes.

1066
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,800
[woman] For the moment, you're a baby

1067
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,480
who was entrusted into state care…

1068
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,960
Uh…

1069
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,760
I think, in the file,
it said she didn't see you.

1070
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,720
-No, I don't think she did.
-[woman] Right.

1071
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,400
Mrs. Lamothe told me
it was a bit of a mystery.

1072
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,520
She took it to mean
that she didn't see me.

1073
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,000
-She had a Cesarean.
-[woman] I read it. I'm positive.

1074
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,520
Yeah, I know, but she had a Cesarean,

1075
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,200
so they put her to sleep

1076
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,120
and took the baby.

1077
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:51,960
[Olivier] Dear…

1078
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,440
Three little dots.

1079
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,040
I obviously don't know
how to start this letter.

1080
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,240
Which last name. Which first name.

1081
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,160
Should I address you formally or not?

1082
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,600
I could say
I've spent a year looking for you.

1083
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,800
But my approach
in this letter is to be honest.

1084
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,480
So I've spent 32 years looking.

1085
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,800
Thirty-two years of doubt,
but 32 years of happiness too.

1086
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,200
Thirty-two years of questions.

1087
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,080
Thirty-two years of love,

1088
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,400
of solitude, of worry.

1089
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,840
My position is both simple
and very complicated.

1090
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,920
You are my biological mother.

1091
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,680
And for that, I thank you.

1092
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,720
I thank you for the person I am today.

1093
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,680
I thank you for giving birth to me.

1094
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,760
But also because I've had
so much love in my life.

1095
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,080
So many values, so much protection,

1096
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,120
to face a world that can be very tough

1097
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,920
and does you no favors.

1098
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,960
I've had a great family.

1099
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,440
I have a great family.

1100
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,400
One that loves me.

1101
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,240
I have friends.

1102
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,960
My parents who dried my eyes,

1103
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,080
comforted me, and wiped away my tears.

1104
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,440
Who heard my first laughs,
saw my first steps

1105
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,400
and felt my pain.

1106
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,200
But I thank you for all of that.

1107
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:23,920
But within all this,
I've become an adult full of doubts.

1108
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,440
Inexplicable fears.

1109
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:29,400
And maybe only you can help me.

1110
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,560
-[Olivier] Mohammed.
-Yes?

1111
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,800
[Olivier] Want to hear
something funny that happened?

1112
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,080
-[Mohammed] What is it?
-I read an article, and…

1113
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,240
It was about me,
and the title was The Wonder Boy.

1114
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:54,040
-[Mohammed] "The Wonder Boy"?
-Yeah.

1115
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,200
-Do know what that is?
-[Mohammed] No.

1116
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,880
[Olivier] A wonder boy is a boy

1117
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,240
who has achieved success

1118
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:05,120
without necessarily much luck in his past,

1119
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,960
who fought to make it.

1120
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,040
He's a success

1121
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,960
who you could say is…

1122
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,080
[Mohammed] Deserving?

1123
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,400
Not deserving. He's a success…

1124
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,240
that wasn't supposed to happen.

1125
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,400
Do you think I'm a wonder boy?

his biological mother yet.

she recognizes herself in this film."
