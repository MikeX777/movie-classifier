2
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:52,317
- Mommy.
- How's my beautiful girl?

3
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,253
Rodger has my pinwheel.

4
00:00:56,655 --> 00:00:58,557
Boys don't play
with pinwheels.

5
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:00,527
Rodger.

6
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,497
Amelia, come keep mommy company

7
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:07,267
while she does
some calculations.

8
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:12,105
Rodger, I'll come
check on you in a bit.

9
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,174
Rodger, boys don't
play with pinwheels.

10
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:28,286
Rodger.

11
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:39,531
Hey.

12
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,202
We've got a long
drive ahead of us.

13
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:45,370
If we wanna make it to
Pritchard before nightfall,

14
00:01:45,403 --> 00:01:47,840
we've gotta leave soon.

15
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:49,841
Jordan's packing the car.

16
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:50,742
Yeah.

17
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,336
Okay, guys, keep your
eyes open for a gas station

18
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,507
'cause I need fuel
in the form of like

19
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:23,808
five to 10 pepperoni sticks.

20
00:02:23,842 --> 00:02:25,878
Well, I think you
are out of luck.

21
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,513
I'm pretty sure there
is no gas station

22
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:29,181
between here and my house.

23
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:34,387
Well, how about a
couple road rockets, huh?

24
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:35,754
Beer me, Beth.

25
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,390
What?

26
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,623
Beer me.

27
00:02:38,657 --> 00:02:40,493
We don't have any beer.

28
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,461
Beer him too, 'cause
he just crushed two weeks

29
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:44,864
of homework since Westport.

30
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:46,431
- That is true.
- And Jordan,

31
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:48,801
- we don't have any beer.
- It's a hot day.

32
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:51,736
And you know what sounds
great on a hot day?

33
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,639
- An IPA.
- Is this a bit right now?

34
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:55,740
Is she doing a bit because
like we don't have any beer,

35
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:57,376
let alone an IPA.

36
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,376
Well, look at this
there's a gas station.

37
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:00,478
So, that's fortuitous.

38
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:01,913
Now we're talking.

39
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:03,915
Yeah, go ahead and get
your pepperoni sticks.

40
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:06,285
Think they have IPA?

41
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:07,620
They
probably have IPA.

42
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:28,640
Hey, babe,
can I give you a hand?

43
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:29,508
Nah, it's okay.

44
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,376
Jordan's got it.

45
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:31,677
Already on it.

46
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:37,716
Welcome to my humble abode.

47
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,585
Hm, my abode.

48
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:40,485
Same thing.

49
00:03:41,552 --> 00:03:42,788
Yeah, pretty much, actually.

50
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:57,603
This is all yours now, hey?

51
00:03:57,635 --> 00:03:58,670
Yeah, I guess.

52
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:01,441
I haven't seen the will, but.

53
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:04,443
You're right.

54
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:06,545
They should probably have
left the house to me.

55
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:10,316
I'm thinking if we put
the jacuzzi right here

56
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:12,050
in the living room
that'd be really nice

57
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:14,653
and that's kind of like what
your dad would have wanted.

58
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,723
Yeah, I'm pretty
sure you're right.

59
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:27,567
Hey, I just
realized something.

60
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,570
We are orphan buddies now, huh?

61
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:36,308
Hm?

62
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:37,009
No?

63
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:41,012
Anyone hungry?

64
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:42,447
- Always.
- Yes.

65
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:53,492
You guys
want some sandwiches?

66
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:54,394
Eh.

67
00:04:57,963 --> 00:05:00,600
So, did your dad,

68
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:04,403
- did it happen here?
- I don't know.

69
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:07,406
I'll ask the lawyer when I
go meet him in the morning.

70
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,108
So, it could've happened here.

71
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:11,877
Or in the living
room or his bedroom.

72
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,579
Oh, where are we sleeping?

73
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:15,381
'Cause I am not
sleeping in his bed.

74
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:16,815
Oh, good point.

75
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:17,949
I don't really wanna
sleep in there either.

76
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:19,084
Look, we will take my room,

77
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:20,719
you can have Amelia's old room.

78
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:23,556
It's still setup?

79
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:25,391
Yeah, my mom wouldn't let
us touch it after she died.

80
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:26,791
It might be a little dusty, but.

81
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:29,361
I can handle
dusty, that's fine.

82
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:31,096
It's just the creepy factor

83
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,499
I've got a little bit
of a problem with.

84
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:35,901
Well, then I think
you're fresh outta beds.

85
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:37,670
Great, I will take the couch.

86
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:40,872
Unless you guys had
like a family dog

87
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:44,410
that went teets up on it?

88
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:45,844
Jordan, thanks for coming.

89
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:50,115
No place I would rather be.

90
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:52,717
Oh, thank you.

91
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,721
I will eat all of these
sandwiches to myself.

92
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,127
Beth, I just
wanted to thank you.

93
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,028
Oh, you don't have
to thank me, Rodg.

94
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:04,997
I know, but you
were excited for me

95
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,899
to meet your parents
over spring break.

96
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:09,568
Oh, there'll be plenty of
time to go to Hartford later.

97
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,002
I know, but I was
so looking forward

98
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,538
to throwing the pigskin
around with your dad.

99
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:14,140
- Oh, were you?
- Touchdowns.

100
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,440
- Mm hm.
- Yeah.

101
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:16,108
- Right.
- Absolutely.

102
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:17,610
Totally.

103
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:18,943
Sorry, clearly Jordan and I

104
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:20,912
have similar coping mechanisms.

105
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:24,817
Yeah, you do except
Jordan copes 24/7.

106
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,420
That's very true.

107
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:43,735
Sorry, it's just a weird time.

108
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:46,439
It's okay.

109
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:47,139
I get it.

110
00:06:57,649 --> 00:06:59,518
And
yonder, I think he heels.

111
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,685
Not only in place of the final,

112
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:02,120
but maybe as well.

113
00:07:03,654 --> 00:07:05,123
It's a new Stafford,
the connection-

114
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:09,762
And yonder, I think he heels.

115
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:11,062
Not only in place of the final,

116
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,697
but maybe as well.

117
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:26,846
Great.

118
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:54,105
If any of you dolls decide
to get up in the middle night

119
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:56,275
and crawl into bed with me,

120
00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:58,978
I will twist your heads
off like bottle caps.

121
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:01,947
Consider yourself warned.

122
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:21,601
No.

123
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:23,802
No.

124
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:32,778
When is the
funeral service then?

125
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:35,681
Monday, 1:00 p.m.
at St. Michaels.

126
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:38,684
I'll clear my schedule.

127
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:42,888
Oswald was a good man.

128
00:08:44,822 --> 00:08:45,891
He was a good friend.

129
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:49,095
He loved you very much.

130
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:51,096
I know.

131
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:54,299
You know he told me
once that he thought

132
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:56,235
you were smarter than
both him and your mother.

133
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:58,836
That's saying something.

134
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,739
He wouldn't have been surprised

135
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:02,775
if you graduated high school
two or three years early.

136
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:04,744
Yeah, well, I didn't.

137
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:12,650
Okay, well, I can get into
whatever specifics you'd like,

138
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:14,120
but to give you the gist of it,

139
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,758
he left everything to you;
a house, everything in it.

140
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,961
He'd accumulated quite
a substantial nest egg-

141
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,029
- Sorry, do you know what
happened to him, specifically?

142
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:28,033
The hospital said heart
attack, but he wasn't even 50.

143
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,735
All I know is
that they found him

144
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:32,705
at the top of the stairs
outside Amelia's room.

145
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:37,710
When we last spoke he did
seem distracted though.

146
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:40,879
He was almost manic.

147
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:42,815
And what do you mean by that?

148
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,151
He was very agitated.

149
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:48,820
He mentioned he had
discovered something.

150
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,627
But I didn't realize he
was that out of sorts.

151
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:55,327
No.

152
00:09:57,328 --> 00:09:59,864
No, I don't think anyone did.

153
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:46,811
- Hey.
- Hey.

154
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:52,384
You know, if I knew that
your dad didn't have any porn

155
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:55,220
I would have gone to Fort
Lauderdale with the Tri-Lambs.

156
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:57,423
But don't worry, I took
care of that for you.

157
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,324
You're welcome.

158
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,393
Nice shirt, you look good.

159
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:05,464
I bet Max could not keep
his hands off of you.

160
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:07,131
All right, so
you want me to take

161
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:09,031
a look for the power
cord for the laptop?

162
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:10,369
Already charging.

163
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:11,903
That was fast.

164
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,471
Gotta find Ozzie's stash.

165
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:15,006
And that was gross.

166
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,074
You know where Beth is?

167
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:18,843
Uh, upstairs probably.

168
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:23,415
All right, I think that is
where I will be for a while.

169
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:25,918
Bye.

170
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,230
Hey.

171
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:39,798
Hey, what's up?

172
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:41,365
I was just talking
to my parents.

173
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,934
How'd it go?

174
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,168
It's fine, it was all right.

175
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:45,437
Oh.

176
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,805
I should have come with you.

177
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:47,939
No, no, don't sweat it.

178
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:50,174
The funeral's gonna be Monday.

179
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:51,076
Okay.

180
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,912
So, did you get the house?

181
00:11:53,945 --> 00:11:55,214
Yeah.

182
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:56,347
Are you gonna keep it?

183
00:11:57,315 --> 00:11:58,951
Maybe.

184
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,252
I mean, I'd be lying if
I said I hadn't thought

185
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:01,886
of some upgrades I would make.

186
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,755
Oh, you should
work on the drafts

187
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:06,324
because your sister's bedroom
door like shut super hard

188
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:08,059
and scared the shit out of me.

189
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:09,094
- Really?
- Yeah.

190
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:11,429
All right, we can
move rooms if you want.

191
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:13,097
No, no, no.

192
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,033
No, I like it in here.

193
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,769
All right.

194
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:17,470
Come on.

195
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:21,774
I'll be, uh,
I'll be right down.

196
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,375
Okay.

197
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:05,116
I am so sorry, Rodger.

198
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:09,455
It's just the two of us now.

199
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,192
So, we're gonna have to take
care of each other, okay?

200
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,111
Oh, no.

201
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:35,447
- Beth!
- Oh, God.

202
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,383
I found a photo
album and if you think

203
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,953
that Rodger is
strange looking now,

204
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:44,222
just you wait till you
see the preteen version.

205
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:46,390
I was born ready.

206
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:53,165
- Aw, so weird looking.
- Looks like a cute kid.

207
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:55,233
- Weird looking guy.
- It's cute!

208
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:04,375
You remember what
we did in there?

209
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:05,277
Stop it.

210
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:08,147
- Please.
- Mm hm.

211
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:11,316
Okay.

212
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:13,018
You throw it away.

213
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:16,055
Toss it.

214
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:20,325
Okay, let
me see these photos.

215
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:23,294
- Coffees.
- Thank you, ooh.

216
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:27,164
Thanks.

217
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:29,935
Aw.

218
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:34,273
You're so cute!

219
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,341
- Oh, he's not weird looking.
- Oh, God.

220
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,611
- Right?
- You're so cute.

221
00:14:40,644 --> 00:14:42,280
Nothing strange about
that kid, look at that.

222
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:44,048
- No, just, just the face.
- Nothing.

223
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:46,284
Oh, look at that
littler super hero.

224
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:48,953
- Is that the basement?
- Yep.

225
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,423
I have never been down there.

226
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:53,591
My mom always said
it was off limits.

227
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:57,328
I mean, Amelia and I always
snuck down and played scientist.

228
00:14:57,361 --> 00:15:00,365
So, I remember this one
time we got spanked so bad

229
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:02,234
'cause we messed up one
of my mom's equations.

230
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:04,603
She'd been working on
it for like months.

231
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:07,939
I think the only reason
she invited us down

232
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:10,442
in the lab this time was
because she just won a grant.

233
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:12,444
Wanted a photo of
the happy family

234
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:15,079
in front of her life's work.

235
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:18,016
Wait, is that a
head back there?

236
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:20,985
Yeah, Rodger's mom
collected severed heads.

237
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,388
Like she was a serial killer.

238
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:26,190
- Jordan.
- Beth?

239
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:28,427
Stop.

240
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:31,363
Well, she killed one person,

241
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:36,200
so I guess technically not a
serial killer, just a killer.

242
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:44,041
Amelia, take your
arms out please.

243
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:44,944
Thank you.

244
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,213
Okay, everybody say cheese.

245
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:54,686
Cheese!

246
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:57,156
All right, Rodger.

247
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:02,561
Your mom's been
gone for six years.

248
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,630
I think it's time for
a little catharsis.

249
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,034
Eh?

250
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:12,037
To the lab!

251
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:31,555
You guys trying to hide the
Ark of the Covenant in here?

252
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:33,525
I mean, it's a good plan.

253
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:36,794
Put it amongst all of this junk.

254
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:37,730
What's this for?

255
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,432
I don't know.

256
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:42,067
I'd have to spend
some time with it.

257
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,335
My mom was like
a physics genius.

258
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:45,269
- So are you.
- Oh.

259
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:48,206
But she did have about
20 years of study

260
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,474
on me when she wrote this.

261
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:50,508
So, yeah.

262
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:09,293
What the hell?

263
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:11,730
What is it, more
physics stuff?

264
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:15,733
It looks like some
psychiatrist reports on me.

265
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:18,769
When did you go
to a psychiatrist?

266
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:20,672
That is a good question.

267
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:22,607
I have zero memory
of any of this.

268
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,178
It looks like when
I was about eight.

269
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,679
Well, what do the reports say?

270
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,414
Well, I can't tell.

271
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:32,084
The doctor's
handwriting is horrible.

272
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:34,485
There's also a ton
of abbreviations.

273
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:37,155
Looks like around the time
when Amelia died though.

274
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:42,161
Jordan, do you remember anything
about me going to a shrink?

275
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:45,496
Jordan?

276
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,469
It's fine.

277
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,605
Jordan?

278
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,741
Seriously?

279
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:59,478
Ah!

280
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,480
Fuck.

281
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:03,814
I'm sorry, I had to.

282
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:06,151
- I'm sorry.
- Geez, Jordan.

283
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:09,855
Seriously, Jordan?

284
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:10,822
Beth, wait.

285
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,525
I thought it was funny.

286
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:14,659
No, I know it was funny.

287
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,294
That was funny, that's funny.

288
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,145
- Hi.
- Hi.

289
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:37,515
Look, I like Jordan, I do.

290
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:40,484
You know I do, but
sometimes she just

291
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:41,886
doesn't know when to stop.

292
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,822
I know, you're right.

293
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:46,258
Jordan has always been there
for me when no one else was.

294
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,159
- I know.
- There's been a lot of times

295
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:49,927
in my life I needed
someone to turn to,

296
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:51,462
and she was always there.

297
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,500
But now you have me.

298
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:59,571
Yeah and I am very lucky to
have both of you in my life.

299
00:19:00,637 --> 00:19:03,407
What, but only one of us

300
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:04,710
- will be doing this.
- Oh.

301
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:20,391
Are you sure?

302
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:22,226
Yeah.

303
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:44,249
Oh, fuck.

304
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:56,627
Oh, my God!

305
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:57,895
Jesus, what?

306
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,598
- What?
- I saw something,

307
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,634
I thought I, I thought
I saw a shadow.

308
00:20:03,634 --> 00:20:04,502
But.

309
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,539
Uh, would you be referring
to your own shadow?

310
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:10,809
I don't know, yeah, maybe.

311
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,444
I'm sorry.

312
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,479
- You scared?
- Yeah.

313
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:15,779
Huh.

314
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:30,662
What the fuck?

315
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:44,342
Oh, if this is an
invitation I'm afraid

316
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,377
I'll have to politely decline.

317
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,947
Jordan, did you
uh, sorry did you...

318
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:52,951
Did I?

319
00:20:52,983 --> 00:20:54,785
Sorry, I thought
I saw something.

320
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:58,323
Maybe I was just falling
asleep in the shower.

321
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,291
Does that, does that
happen to people?

322
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,961
What do you think you saw?

323
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,397
I thought I saw a
person in there with me

324
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,700
and they starting speaking
with this messed up voice,

325
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:09,967
and then they disappeared.

326
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:15,572
It sounds, it
sounds pretty great.

327
00:21:15,605 --> 00:21:18,844
I mean, I would get the voice
thing checked out, but nice.

328
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,352
So, how does it look?

329
00:21:27,384 --> 00:21:28,987
Oh, I don't know.

330
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:33,025
I doubt these are my only
records from Dr. Henrietta Cox.

331
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,627
It's only a few pages here.

332
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,761
I'm assuming there's
gotta be more.

333
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:37,762
So, what is she writing about?

334
00:21:37,795 --> 00:21:39,898
Don't know yet.

335
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,732
I'm not that far in,
but I wouldn't mind paying her a visit.

336
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:43,734
You should.

337
00:21:46,037 --> 00:21:47,673
- Have a good run.
- Bye.

338
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:09,727
So, I said, listen dude,

339
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,863
this is Tinder not
the Laugh Factory.

340
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:14,598
Go find somewhere else to
practice your tight five.

341
00:22:14,632 --> 00:22:16,901
Okay.

342
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:18,502
Poor guy caught you
at the wrong time.

343
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:21,773
Missed me by
like five minutes.

344
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:23,542
What are you
guys talking about?

345
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:30,447
I'm what you would call,
Rodg, how would you put it?

346
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,615
- I wouldn't put it-
- You know what?

347
00:22:31,648 --> 00:22:32,750
Don't, yeah, don't.

348
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:35,887
I am sexually liberated.

349
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,823
Depending on the slant of the
wind I can be as buttoned up

350
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:41,725
as Jim Caviezel or as
loose as John Mayer.

351
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:47,499
That was weird.

352
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:51,136
Speaking of weird, I
found something strange

353
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,570
on your dad's laptop.

354
00:22:52,603 --> 00:22:54,439
- Uh uh, oh, God no.
- No.

355
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:55,839
Whatever you found on
there, I don't wanna know.

356
00:22:55,873 --> 00:22:57,409
- No, no!
- I don't wanna know about it.

357
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,543
- I don't wanna know about it.
- No!

358
00:22:58,576 --> 00:22:59,943
Just keep it to yourself.

359
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:01,813
No, well there were
photos and files,

360
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:03,847
things that he had been writing
over the past couple years.

361
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:05,884
- And what's weird about that?
- Right, that's normal.

362
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:10,922
But I did find a file on
the desktop that's password

363
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:16,394
protected and I could open
it for you if you wanted.

364
00:23:17,994 --> 00:23:19,596
Well, what
was the name of the file?

365
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,065
That's the thing,
it was called "Rodger"

366
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:23,567
and it was created right
around the time he died.

367
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:31,009
That is weird.

368
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,576
- Go for it.
- Cool.

369
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:52,596
What the hell?

370
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,132
Hey, did you hear that?

371
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:57,501
- No, what was it?
- Sounded like something fell.

372
00:23:57,535 --> 00:23:59,471
It was probably
just the house settling

373
00:23:59,503 --> 00:24:01,673
or Amelia's door
slamming shut again.

374
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,709
Did you reopen it?

375
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:06,110
I don't know, I must've.

376
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:10,515
Or Jordan passed out while
she was going to the bathroom.

377
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:14,152
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- All right.

378
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:35,941
Let me in.

379
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:42,212
Jesus!

380
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:43,114
What?

381
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:46,585
Rodg.

382
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,855
I coulda sworn someone
was in bed with us.

383
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:52,790
You wish.

384
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,027
- No, it-
- Come here.

385
00:24:58,962 --> 00:25:02,533
All right.

386
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:19,951
Dr. Cox.

387
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:23,654
- How have you been?
- Oh, great.

388
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:27,625
Sorry, I, I, I
really have to run.

389
00:25:27,657 --> 00:25:29,059
Bye, Grace.

390
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:34,065
I'll be right back, I
gotta talk to someone.

391
00:25:38,301 --> 00:25:40,270
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dr. Cox.

392
00:25:40,304 --> 00:25:41,206
Can I help you?

393
00:25:42,606 --> 00:25:43,908
You're Dr. Henrietta Cox.

394
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:46,076
No, sorry.

395
00:25:49,145 --> 00:25:50,014
Sorry.

396
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,625
Dr. Cox, why are
you avoiding me?

397
00:26:02,692 --> 00:26:03,862
I guess Oswald was wrong.

398
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,232
Your father said you blocked
out our sessions completely.

399
00:26:12,336 --> 00:26:14,673
Why didn't you want
me to know who you were?

400
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:17,675
Decaf?

401
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:20,110
No, thanks.

402
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:23,047
And my father was
right by the way.

403
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,182
I don't remember you.

404
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:25,583
He just had one of your files.

405
00:26:28,385 --> 00:26:30,120
I didn't want you
to know who I was

406
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:32,990
because I didn't
wanna stir things up.

407
00:26:33,023 --> 00:26:35,359
Your father said you didn't
remember our sessions,

408
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,162
and I wanted to
leave it that way.

409
00:26:38,695 --> 00:26:40,063
I shouldn't have
gone to that funeral,

410
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:42,232
but we were friends
and colleagues,

411
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:43,801
and I felt I should say goodbye.

412
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:45,236
Well, that's just it.

413
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:46,337
Why don't I have
any memory of you?

414
00:26:47,837 --> 00:26:48,706
Please sit.

415
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:06,958
Memory repression whether
through natural processes

416
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,961
or otherwise can be
brought on to help forget

417
00:27:10,994 --> 00:27:13,230
negative events one
has experienced.

418
00:27:13,263 --> 00:27:15,198
I know my sister
died, I remember that,

419
00:27:15,231 --> 00:27:18,802
but Dr. Cox, did...

420
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:20,372
Did I do something horrible?

421
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,842
Not to my knowledge.

422
00:27:24,974 --> 00:27:26,778
Am I schizophrenic?

423
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,747
It was a consideration,
but the first signs

424
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,017
of schizophrenia usually
present themselves

425
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:36,354
in an individual's 20s, so you
would have been a rare case.

426
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:37,989
So, what was it?

427
00:27:38,021 --> 00:27:40,390
I didn't get to
do a full analysis.

428
00:27:40,423 --> 00:27:43,028
After a month, your mother
pulled you out of care.

429
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:46,163
Why did my parents bring
me here in the first place?

430
00:27:46,196 --> 00:27:47,931
You have to
understand you weren't

431
00:27:47,964 --> 00:27:49,332
really very talkative in our-

432
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:50,801
- Dr. Cox, please.

433
00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:55,440
In simple terms?

434
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:59,810
You had an imaginary friend.

435
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:03,414
That's it?

436
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:06,884
A lot of kids have
imaginary friends.

437
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:10,954
But, Rodger, not many kids
are scared to death of theirs.

438
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,762
Can I read the
rest of the file?

439
00:28:17,795 --> 00:28:19,197
I gave everything
I had to your father.

440
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,365
I really don't have
a lot to tell you.

441
00:28:21,397 --> 00:28:24,868
I've had a ton of patients in
the last dozen or so years-

442
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:27,404
- Then just tell
me what you remember.

443
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:33,744
Just that you didn't
like to go into any room

444
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,279
if you thought she was in there.

445
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,750
Okay, well, which
rooms specifically?

446
00:28:38,782 --> 00:28:39,416
Oh, geez.

447
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,317
Most of them.

448
00:28:43,253 --> 00:28:45,889
I do remember after
one particular day

449
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:49,360
you couldn't go into
the bathroom anymore.

450
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:56,334
Rodger, are you okay?

451
00:28:58,001 --> 00:28:59,037
Yeah, I'm fine.

452
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:01,438
- What happened?
- Nothing.

453
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:02,906
Would you ever
just consider that

454
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,942
it was 'cause my
sister had died?

455
00:29:04,974 --> 00:29:06,977
You started seeing
it before she died.

456
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:12,016
But you did tell me that the
first time you saw your friend

457
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,253
you were in the backyard
with your sister.

458
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:19,923
That's my four o'clock.

459
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:21,959
Okay, you mind if I just
wait outside till it's over?

460
00:29:21,991 --> 00:29:23,894
There's just a couple more
things I wanna talk to you about.

461
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:27,031
I have to go look after
my aunt, she's very sick.

462
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:29,400
I'm going to be on
leave indefinitely.

463
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:31,035
If you don't mind.

464
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,827
Rodger?

465
00:29:58,528 --> 00:29:59,798
Are you home?

466
00:30:00,497 --> 00:30:01,365
Jordan?

467
00:30:25,021 --> 00:30:26,124
Who's there?

468
00:30:39,068 --> 00:30:40,070
Who's there?

469
00:30:58,188 --> 00:31:00,925
Ow!

470
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,494
Beth, are you okay?

471
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:05,096
Jesus.

472
00:31:05,128 --> 00:31:06,096
What were you doing down here?

473
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,565
What were you doing?

474
00:31:07,597 --> 00:31:08,965
I heard the door slam
and I called your name

475
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:10,433
and you didn't answer me.

476
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:12,370
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- Obviously.

477
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,139
Well, do you think
it's sprained or-

478
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:17,275
- No, it's just, it just hurts.

479
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:21,545
What were you looking for?

480
00:31:21,577 --> 00:31:23,446
I went to Dr. Cox's office.

481
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,548
She told me she gave my
dad the rest of the files,

482
00:31:25,582 --> 00:31:27,685
so I figured maybe
it was, I don't know,

483
00:31:27,718 --> 00:31:29,220
packed up down here somewhere.

484
00:31:29,252 --> 00:31:31,422
What else did she tell you?

485
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:32,622
Not much, she
doesn't really remember

486
00:31:32,655 --> 00:31:34,224
anything about my case.

487
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:35,960
But do you wanna
help me look for it?

488
00:31:35,992 --> 00:31:38,596
Well, I'd like to
bandage my wrist first.

489
00:31:40,163 --> 00:31:41,265
- Right, of course-
- And I'm studying

490
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:42,500
for a biochem midterm, so.

491
00:31:42,532 --> 00:31:43,634
Why, it's in like two weeks.

492
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,269
Because some of us aren't

493
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:46,536
second generation
Einstein's, Rodger.

494
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:49,908
There you guys are.

495
00:31:51,741 --> 00:31:52,609
What's going on?

496
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,246
Beth, I can help
you find the bandage.

497
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:56,213
I got it.

498
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,274
So, trouble in paradise?

499
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,411
No, no, I was
just being stupid.

500
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:31,281
Sometimes I think I don't listen
to her as much as I should.

501
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:33,183
Hm.

502
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,086
Some people just aren't
dating material, you know?

503
00:32:35,118 --> 00:32:36,386
Oh, and you are?

504
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,123
I think so.

505
00:32:39,155 --> 00:32:40,490
I've had my share of
relationships, sure.

506
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:41,625
Yeah, I mean
there's a difference

507
00:32:41,657 --> 00:32:43,226
between dating someone though

508
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:45,663
and swiping right on
every dude in the state.

509
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:55,038
I'm gonna go work on
that encryption thing.

510
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:58,508
Jordan, Jordan,
come on I didn't...

511
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:00,310
Come on, Jordan.

512
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:03,280
Jordan, I didn't
mean it like that.

513
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:05,249
Idiot.

514
00:34:42,778 --> 00:34:44,114
What the hell?

515
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,638
What you doing?

516
00:35:09,438 --> 00:35:13,409
Helping my ungrateful
friend crack an encryption.

517
00:35:13,443 --> 00:35:14,678
For what reason?

518
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,147
I have no idea.

519
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,249
Sounds like a dick.

520
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:21,852
He is.

521
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:24,755
I, uh, got you
something though.

522
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:29,927
- Whirly?
- Yeah.

523
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,896
Where did you find this?

524
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:34,898
Just one of the
boxes downstairs.

525
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:36,634
Oh, God.

526
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:37,701
I thought this was a goner.

527
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:39,536
I loved this so much.

528
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,210
Hey, I'm sorry
for snapping at you.

529
00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:47,644
I was being an idiot.

530
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:49,614
Hm, you are an idiot.

531
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,668
What are you doing?

532
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,436
I'm gonna go stay with
a friend for a few days.

533
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:15,271
Beth, I came up here
to apologize, okay?

534
00:36:15,304 --> 00:36:16,173
You don't...

535
00:36:18,507 --> 00:36:20,677
- Beth?
- Rodg, you lost your sister

536
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:25,715
and your mom and your dad was
all you had left and Jordan.

537
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:28,786
And now, with your
dad gone and.

538
00:36:31,288 --> 00:36:33,356
Rodg, I see the way
that you look at her.

539
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,560
At some point a girl's gotta
start believing what she sees.

540
00:36:36,592 --> 00:36:38,494
I don't know what
you think you saw, but-

541
00:36:38,527 --> 00:36:41,531
- Look, I get that this
is a weird time for you.

542
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:42,666
Okay, I get that.

543
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:44,534
With your dad, with everything.

544
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:48,639
I just, I just think I'm gonna
head out for a day or two

545
00:36:48,672 --> 00:36:52,342
and we could both use some
time to collect our thoughts.

546
00:37:05,422 --> 00:37:08,425
Okay, well, I guess I'll see ya.

547
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,027
Yeah.

548
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,748
Hey, mom.

549
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:34,919
Your father is off
fucking some whore.

550
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:45,396
Beth just left.

551
00:37:47,797 --> 00:37:49,632
- She left?
- Yep.

552
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:51,068
Like left, left?

553
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:52,068
I don't think we're
gonna be seeing her

554
00:37:52,101 --> 00:37:53,403
until school next week.

555
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:55,706
What happened?

556
00:37:57,606 --> 00:37:59,610
I don't know, I really
don't wanna talk about it.

557
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:02,945
All right, then
rather than focusing

558
00:38:02,978 --> 00:38:06,317
on the enigma that
is a woman's heart,

559
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:08,719
why don't we tackle a
more manageable mystery.

560
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:11,454
If the rest of
your file was here

561
00:38:11,487 --> 00:38:12,656
we would've found it already.

562
00:38:14,056 --> 00:38:14,924
Backwash?

563
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:17,427
Okay.

564
00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:20,897
Then tell me, where could it be?

565
00:38:22,498 --> 00:38:24,567
Maybe she didn't
tell you the truth

566
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:26,436
about the rest of the file, hm?

567
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:27,804
- Dr. Cox?
- Mm hm.

568
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:29,440
So you think it's still there?

569
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:31,474
Unless she moved
it after your visit.

570
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:34,377
I mean, she's out of town.

571
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:35,378
If she was here then we
could talk to her about it.

572
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:37,480
Mm hm, but she's not.

573
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:41,885
So maybe we just
break into her office?

574
00:38:43,552 --> 00:38:44,922
I don't think that's
the best option-

575
00:38:44,954 --> 00:38:46,556
- Listen,
she hasn't been honest

576
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,492
with you from the
very beginning.

577
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:49,492
So, in my mind there's one way
we're gonna get what we want.

578
00:38:49,525 --> 00:38:50,728
And that's a B and E?

579
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,463
- And that's a B and E.
- Mm hm.

580
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,599
It's fine, it's fine.

581
00:38:56,632 --> 00:38:57,534
I'll do it myself.

582
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,909
Fine.

583
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:07,545
We will break into her office.

584
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,751
Do it as fast as you can.

585
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:16,653
Okay, don't rush me.

586
00:39:24,027 --> 00:39:26,896
I think maybe a little
haste would be good.

587
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:28,698
I don't need haste.

588
00:39:28,731 --> 00:39:30,067
I have wit and...

589
00:39:43,646 --> 00:39:44,782
Bravo.

590
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,016
You're the man.

591
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:50,153
- Only flashlights in here.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

592
00:39:50,186 --> 00:39:51,054
I know.

593
00:39:59,862 --> 00:40:01,664
Seriously?

594
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:03,132
I said I would
bring a flashlight.

595
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:05,869
How am I supposed to
know that it's dead?

596
00:40:05,902 --> 00:40:07,503
Check.

597
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:08,605
You would check.

598
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,208
Just use your phone.

599
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,143
I know, I am.

600
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:31,829
Do you really think
you wanna go back?

601
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,564
You could just spend the
rest of the break with me

602
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,200
and I'll get you back
to school for Sunday.

603
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,568
No, I really think
that I was wrong.

604
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:43,773
Jordan is his best
friend and I got jealous.

605
00:40:43,806 --> 00:40:45,241
I know how much
he cares about me,

606
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:47,545
and I really care about him.

607
00:40:48,878 --> 00:40:50,480
Okay.

608
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:53,050
Well, if you change your
mind I'm here for you.

609
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,699
She said she was outta town.

610
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,602
She's got meetings
booked all week long.

611
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,171
I guess that sick
aunt of hers just got better.

612
00:41:15,871 --> 00:41:17,507
Hm, a true miracle.

613
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:22,713
Your file, good sir.

614
00:41:23,646 --> 00:41:25,047
Very well done.

615
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:27,217
Let's get outta here
before we get caught.

616
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,719
Hey, hey,
hey, that's a good idea.

617
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,788
I think a better idea
would be if we just

618
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,558
like really quickly
shit on her desk.

619
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:39,530
Who hurt you?

620
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:43,233
You're so close to
being cool all the time,

621
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:45,702
but you just never get there.

622
00:42:13,028 --> 00:42:13,898
Hello?

623
00:42:14,797 --> 00:42:15,932
Who's there?

624
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,568
Look, Jordan, this isn't funny.

625
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:20,804
Rodg?

626
00:42:46,128 --> 00:42:46,996
Seriously?

627
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:50,233
Harlot.

628
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:52,635
Who are you?

629
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:53,936
What are you doing here?

630
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:57,073
Harlot!

631
00:43:04,813 --> 00:43:05,815
No.

632
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:13,322
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

633
00:43:13,356 --> 00:43:14,291
No, no, no!

634
00:43:15,858 --> 00:43:17,760
No, no!

635
00:43:17,793 --> 00:43:20,329
No!

636
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:34,311
- Want some wine?
- Yeah, sure.

637
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:40,651
So, anything else about your
imaginary friend in there?

638
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:43,053
Yeah, this has got
everything I needed.

639
00:43:43,085 --> 00:43:44,221
And some other stuff.

640
00:43:44,253 --> 00:43:45,322
What is it?

641
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,893
Dr. Cox hypnotized me
to repress my memories.

642
00:43:53,896 --> 00:43:55,364
Hm.

643
00:43:55,398 --> 00:43:57,000
What?

644
00:43:57,032 --> 00:43:58,768
She had a session
with my little sister

645
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,004
a week before she died.

646
00:44:13,115 --> 00:44:15,018
Dr. Cox, we really need to talk.

647
00:44:17,786 --> 00:44:18,888
This is the rest of my file.

648
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:20,322
I tried to find my sister's,

649
00:44:20,356 --> 00:44:23,026
but it's not in any
of your drawers.

650
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:25,863
- I should call the police.
- Oh, please, be my guest.

651
00:44:29,932 --> 00:44:30,867
What do you want?

652
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:33,469
I just wanna hear about
the rest of my sessions,

653
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:35,338
and now my sister's.

654
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:38,842
It's best if you just put all
this behind you and move on.

655
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:39,742
I have.

656
00:44:40,476 --> 00:44:41,978
I'm sorry, you have?

657
00:44:43,346 --> 00:44:45,882
It's just, it was
something like...

658
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:49,485
Listen, Ozzie and I
thought it would be better-

659
00:44:49,518 --> 00:44:50,386
- Ozzie?

660
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:54,090
Only my mom called
my dad, Ozzie.

661
00:44:54,123 --> 00:44:58,961
How, how close were you two?

662
00:44:58,994 --> 00:45:01,831
We were.

663
00:45:01,864 --> 00:45:03,500
- You fuck!
- No, you, Rodger,

664
00:45:03,532 --> 00:45:05,034
I know this is upsetting.

665
00:45:06,902 --> 00:45:08,904
Did your husband know about
your relationship with my dad?

666
00:45:08,938 --> 00:45:09,807
Don't!

667
00:45:11,974 --> 00:45:13,242
I want Amelia's file.

668
00:45:14,177 --> 00:45:15,846
I don't have it.

669
00:45:15,878 --> 00:45:18,114
- I burned in.
- Sounds great.

670
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:23,153
But I can tell you everything,
just please don't do this.

671
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:28,057
How do I know you're
gonna tell me the truth?

672
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:28,958
I give you my word.

673
00:45:30,492 --> 00:45:32,295
But with I'm about
to say I don't expect

674
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:34,297
you to believe me anyway.

675
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:44,240
Over
the last few days,

676
00:45:44,273 --> 00:45:47,143
some weird things
have been going on.

677
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,880
I swear I keep seeing
someone in the house,

678
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:53,250
but when I go to check
it out, no one's there.

679
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,056
This is the third time this
week that I've cleaned these up.

680
00:46:00,088 --> 00:46:01,824
Shut it off!

681
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:03,126
Whoa.

682
00:46:05,394 --> 00:46:08,565
Promise me you won't
talk to anybody about this.

683
00:46:08,597 --> 00:46:10,333
I promise.

684
00:46:11,934 --> 00:46:13,302
Your parents brought
you in to see me

685
00:46:13,335 --> 00:46:14,971
around your eighth birthday.

686
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:18,942
They said you'd been extremely
agitated for a few days.

687
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:24,079
That was around the time your
imaginary friend showed up.

688
00:46:24,112 --> 00:46:25,815
Obviously I believed
something else

689
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,818
was causing your anxiety.

690
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:32,856
But when you talked you would
only talk about your friend

691
00:46:33,922 --> 00:46:35,024
and how that friend was starting

692
00:46:35,057 --> 00:46:36,893
to gravitate towards Amelia.

693
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:42,231
I figured if I could
get her to admit

694
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:44,134
that she'd never
really seen your friend

695
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:46,369
then that might take some
of the pressure off you.

696
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:51,875
I also got the sense your mom
wasn't the best for you kids.

697
00:46:51,907 --> 00:46:53,543
You must've read
that in the file.

698
00:46:53,576 --> 00:46:56,346
Is that why you only gave
my dad half the folder?

699
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:57,246
No.

700
00:46:58,414 --> 00:47:00,383
He knew what I thought of her.

701
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:02,286
I didn't get it
all to him because

702
00:47:04,052 --> 00:47:06,123
I didn't want him
to ask me about it.

703
00:47:07,489 --> 00:47:09,425
What I found with
you and Amelia,

704
00:47:11,393 --> 00:47:13,929
it changes how one
perceives reality.

705
00:47:32,014 --> 00:47:34,884
Could I talk to Amelia
alone for a moment?

706
00:47:45,394 --> 00:47:46,496
She's very pretty.

707
00:47:47,396 --> 00:47:49,099
Thank you.

708
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,902
Amelia, I'd like
to talk to you

709
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:54,438
about Rodger's imaginary friend.

710
00:47:55,338 --> 00:47:56,940
Who's that?

711
00:47:56,972 --> 00:47:59,009
The woman who's in
your house sometimes.

712
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:00,009
Debbie?

713
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,443
She's not imaginary.

714
00:48:01,476 --> 00:48:04,313
Rodger's never called
her by a name before.

715
00:48:04,347 --> 00:48:06,583
She's my friend, not Rodger's.

716
00:48:06,615 --> 00:48:08,918
What can you tell
me about Debbie?

717
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,387
We play together.

718
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,655
She doesn't stay
very long though.

719
00:48:12,688 --> 00:48:15,224
Why is Debbie not
Rodger's friend?

720
00:48:15,257 --> 00:48:18,327
I don't know, she just
always want to play with me.

721
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,996
Why do you think that is?

722
00:48:20,028 --> 00:48:23,233
Ask her.

723
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:24,401
Um, I would-

724
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:31,206
Debbie doesn't like strangers.

725
00:48:33,175 --> 00:48:35,144
So, you
saw what, a ghost?

726
00:48:37,146 --> 00:48:38,682
I thought I was
losing my mind.

727
00:48:40,215 --> 00:48:42,585
Then later I learned that Amelia

728
00:48:42,617 --> 00:48:45,621
had died in an accident
in your basement.

729
00:48:45,655 --> 00:48:49,125
I told your mother about
my experience with Debbie.

730
00:48:49,157 --> 00:48:51,126
She thought it was crazy.

731
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:53,529
And after that she wouldn't
let me see you again.

732
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,099
You hypnotized me.

733
00:48:57,132 --> 00:48:58,534
You watch too many movies-

734
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,203
- You hypnotized me
to make me forget.

735
00:49:00,235 --> 00:49:01,704
That's not normal
memory repression.

736
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:02,438
Rodger.

737
00:49:04,206 --> 00:49:06,442
- Undo it.
- I don't know how.

738
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:07,577
You made me forget, okay?

739
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:09,179
You can make me remember.

740
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:10,980
Whatever this thing
is if it exists,

741
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:12,682
it might've killed my sister.

742
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:15,585
I don't think so.

743
00:49:18,153 --> 00:49:20,356
Your father told me
that Amelia complained

744
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:23,125
that Debbie disappeared
about a week before she died.

745
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,496
Dredging up those memories now
for you will only be worse.

746
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,165
You're gonna hypnotize
me or your husband's

747
00:49:29,197 --> 00:49:30,666
gonna find out exactly
what you've been up to.

748
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:32,701
I'm sorry you had
to find out like this,

749
00:49:32,735 --> 00:49:36,740
but please don't ruin my
marriage because of your anger.

750
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:40,210
Ruin you marriage?

751
00:49:42,277 --> 00:49:44,613
You did that a long time ago.

752
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:51,421
Fine!

753
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:57,494
Sit down.

754
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:03,233
But I should warn you
there's no guarantee

755
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:05,001
this is going to work.

756
00:50:12,307 --> 00:50:13,342
Close your eyes.

757
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:19,548
Listen to the ticking...

758
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:26,423
Of the grandfather clock.

759
00:50:42,204 --> 00:50:44,273
Let me out.

760
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:46,743
Everybody say cheese.

761
00:50:46,775 --> 00:50:48,544
Cheese.

762
00:50:48,577 --> 00:50:50,213
Nice, just one more.

763
00:50:53,516 --> 00:50:54,617
Rodger.

764
00:51:02,724 --> 00:51:04,760
This is called an equation.

765
00:51:04,793 --> 00:51:07,396
How do you cast your equation?

766
00:51:07,429 --> 00:51:10,232
A physicist applies an
equation to the laws of physics.

767
00:51:10,266 --> 00:51:12,469
Let me out.

768
00:51:16,338 --> 00:51:18,541
How do you feel?

769
00:51:20,543 --> 00:51:22,211
I'm uh, I'm okay.

770
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:25,615
I don't really
remember anything more

771
00:51:25,648 --> 00:51:27,550
than I did before though.

772
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:28,718
It can take days.

773
00:51:30,152 --> 00:51:31,653
Sometimes many
sessions of this nature

774
00:51:31,686 --> 00:51:33,188
to unlock your memory.

775
00:51:33,222 --> 00:51:34,357
Sometimes it
doesn't work at all.

776
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:38,161
The human mind has
allowed these memories

777
00:51:38,193 --> 00:51:41,565
to be locked away from their
owner for a reason after all.

778
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:47,536
Sorry.

779
00:51:52,507 --> 00:51:53,609
Hey.

780
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,478
Hey, you need to come home.

781
00:51:56,512 --> 00:51:58,548
Like now.

782
00:51:58,581 --> 00:52:00,617
Why, just tell
me over the phone.

783
00:52:01,951 --> 00:52:03,385
Okay, no, all right.

784
00:52:03,418 --> 00:52:04,753
I'm coming home.

785
00:52:11,193 --> 00:52:12,594
Okay, there's two videos
in the encrypted file.

786
00:52:12,628 --> 00:52:14,497
The first isn't
the most.

787
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:16,699
Well, we'll just start
at the beginning, okay?

788
00:52:16,731 --> 00:52:17,766
You ready?

789
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,668
Go.

790
00:52:20,603 --> 00:52:21,838
Over the last few days,

791
00:52:23,405 --> 00:52:24,608
some weird things
have been going on.

792
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:27,844
I swear I keep seeing
someone in the house,

793
00:52:27,876 --> 00:52:30,813
but when I go to check
it out, no one's there.

794
00:52:32,715 --> 00:52:35,351
This is the third time this
week that I've picked these up.

795
00:52:35,384 --> 00:52:40,322
Shut it off.

796
00:52:40,356 --> 00:52:41,858
Jordan, what, what is-

797
00:52:41,891 --> 00:52:42,893
- Just wait.

798
00:52:45,494 --> 00:52:48,631
After all the
things I've seen in this house,

799
00:52:48,664 --> 00:52:50,266
you came to mind, Rodger.

800
00:52:50,298 --> 00:52:51,967
And I don't know if you
really remember this,

801
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:56,673
but 12 years ago we, we took
you to see a psychiatrist.

802
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:59,709
You had an imaginary friend.

803
00:52:59,742 --> 00:53:01,278
We didn't think it was real.

804
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,481
But now I know you
weren't making it up.

805
00:53:06,315 --> 00:53:08,318
And I think she's back.

806
00:53:15,423 --> 00:53:20,362
Rodg, I think there's a naked
murder ghost in your house.

807
00:53:21,963 --> 00:53:22,831
Right.

808
00:53:24,699 --> 00:53:26,535
I think there's some things
I should probably tell you.

809
00:53:30,905 --> 00:53:33,677
So, you believe
in hypnosis now?

810
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:36,346
Yeah, I guess so.

811
00:53:36,378 --> 00:53:37,880
But you are the
last person on earth

812
00:53:37,913 --> 00:53:39,282
who would believe in hypnosis.

813
00:53:39,315 --> 00:53:40,950
I concluded this at that kegger,

814
00:53:40,983 --> 00:53:42,585
remember the one that
Steve Gutenberg showed up

815
00:53:42,617 --> 00:53:44,920
to at 3:00 a.m. and
you said, I quote,

816
00:53:44,954 --> 00:53:46,456
"I am the last person on earth

817
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:48,324
who would believe in hypnosis."

818
00:53:48,356 --> 00:53:50,492
Look, I don't even know
if it's really worked.

819
00:53:50,525 --> 00:53:54,029
Everything I've seen so far
is stuff I already remembered.

820
00:53:54,063 --> 00:53:56,599
So?

821
00:53:56,632 --> 00:53:57,567
Demon ghosts?

822
00:53:58,733 --> 00:54:00,402
Demon ghosts.

823
00:54:00,436 --> 00:54:03,306
Right, where's the kerosene?

824
00:54:03,338 --> 00:54:04,806
Nuke it from orbit?

825
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,909
Only way to be sure.

826
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,582
Okay, well, we're
not doing that.

827
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:15,952
And I'm not leaving.

828
00:54:17,385 --> 00:54:18,920
- You're not leaving?
- Yeah.

829
00:54:18,954 --> 00:54:20,056
You're not fucking leave?

830
00:54:20,088 --> 00:54:21,923
Of course you're not leaving.

831
00:54:21,956 --> 00:54:24,393
Whatever this thing is it
probably lead to my dad's death.

832
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,928
I think and I bet
that it had probably

833
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,329
had something to do
with Amelia's, too.

834
00:54:27,362 --> 00:54:28,297
So, I can't go.

835
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:34,336
All right.

836
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:36,940
We'll stay.

837
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,610
No, Jordan,
that was not an invitation-

838
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:42,411
- I'm not leaving you alone in
this house with Lady Imhotep.

839
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:45,914
Jordan, you don't
have to do that-

840
00:54:45,947 --> 00:54:46,815
- Well, I am.

841
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:51,354
We aren't going anywhere
in this house alone, okay?

842
00:54:51,387 --> 00:54:52,955
Buddy system all the way.

843
00:54:52,987 --> 00:54:54,790
I gotta take a dump?

844
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,492
Well, buddy, buckle up,
you're coming to Stinker Town.

845
00:54:56,525 --> 00:54:58,927
- Oh, geez.
- Oh, you know what else?

846
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,729
We should get cat bells.

847
00:55:00,762 --> 00:55:02,097
So, if one of us falls asleep

848
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,766
and she tries to
snatch the other one,

849
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:05,867
- she can't because cat bells.
- Cat bells.

850
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,670
Well, we're not
gonna do cat bells.

851
00:55:08,704 --> 00:55:09,806
We're just gonna
stick very close

852
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:11,440
together and sleep in shifts.

853
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,342
How about that?

854
00:55:17,413 --> 00:55:20,782
So, where has this Debbie
been the last 12 years?

855
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,823
It's over, I
called off the people.

856
00:55:28,556 --> 00:55:30,759
I feared whatever was
in there went away.

857
00:55:30,793 --> 00:55:33,096
- It might be infections.
- Whoa.

858
00:55:33,128 --> 00:55:34,630
- I'm trying-
- No, we're leaving.

859
00:55:34,663 --> 00:55:36,599
The door is locked.

860
00:55:36,632 --> 00:55:40,737
Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy!

861
00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:42,405
Rodger, you
know you're not supposed

862
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:44,539
to come down here
when I'm working.

863
00:55:44,572 --> 00:55:47,476
Being a scientist is
like being a wizard.

864
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,878
Why's that?

865
00:55:48,911 --> 00:55:49,778
You're writing
spells like Merlin.

866
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:52,614
Sort of.

867
00:55:52,648 --> 00:55:54,717
This is called an equation.

868
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,152
You should ask
your dad about it.

869
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:57,953
I have to get back to work.

870
00:56:04,726 --> 00:56:05,594
Hey.

871
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:09,165
You good?

872
00:56:09,197 --> 00:56:11,000
You have a nightmare?

873
00:56:11,032 --> 00:56:12,067
No, I think it was a memory.

874
00:56:13,702 --> 00:56:14,904
I was in the basement
when I was a kid,

875
00:56:16,472 --> 00:56:17,874
my mom moved out of
the way and in between

876
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,675
the whiteboards was
this bloody face.

877
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:21,911
And that's a memory?

878
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:25,414
Yeah, I think so.

879
00:56:25,447 --> 00:56:26,982
I mean, maybe it was a
dream, but it seemed real.

880
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,552
It seemed like I had
been there before.

881
00:56:29,585 --> 00:56:32,755
Okay, so, every
time you fall asleep

882
00:56:32,788 --> 00:56:34,056
memories are coming back?

883
00:56:37,025 --> 00:56:38,894
That would seem to
be the going trend.

884
00:57:06,088 --> 00:57:07,690
What's this?

885
00:57:07,722 --> 00:57:08,690
These sleeping pills
should knock you out

886
00:57:08,724 --> 00:57:10,559
in about a half an hour.

887
00:57:10,592 --> 00:57:12,761
I'm gonna take the caffeine
pill so I can stay awake

888
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:15,932
while you are
unlocking the mystery.

889
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:17,767
Jordan, nothing says
that I'm gonna remember

890
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,602
something every
time I fall asleep.

891
00:57:21,536 --> 00:57:23,639
I'm all ears
for a better plan.

892
00:57:34,849 --> 00:57:36,184
You know, my mom was
never the best parent

893
00:57:36,217 --> 00:57:37,886
before Amelia died.

894
00:57:39,288 --> 00:57:41,923
But after, she was
worse to dad an I.

895
00:57:41,956 --> 00:57:46,596
She was consumed by this
anger, her equations,

896
00:57:46,628 --> 00:57:49,531
and definitely her booze, but...

897
00:57:52,867 --> 00:57:54,237
I don't know, even
after all that

898
00:57:54,269 --> 00:57:56,873
I still missed
her when she died.

899
00:57:58,974 --> 00:58:02,245
I never wanted
to ask you this.

900
00:58:02,277 --> 00:58:05,080
But you always
say that she died.

901
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:07,583
She just disappeared.

902
00:58:07,615 --> 00:58:08,951
They never found her body.

903
00:58:08,983 --> 00:58:10,853
Wherever she was, she died.

904
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:13,956
Sure, I could easily see
her leaving dad and I,

905
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:15,625
especially after the affair,

906
00:58:15,657 --> 00:58:17,025
but she never would
have left her work.

907
00:58:17,059 --> 00:58:19,729
This stuff was way
too important to her.

908
00:58:22,164 --> 00:58:24,567
So you think that
creature killed her, too?

909
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:27,737
Maybe.

910
00:58:29,605 --> 00:58:32,942
So, it killed one member
of your family, maybe two,

911
00:58:32,974 --> 00:58:34,777
possibly even three.

912
00:58:34,809 --> 00:58:36,679
What are we doing here, Rodger?

913
00:58:36,711 --> 00:58:38,581
If it killed my family,
then I have to kill it.

914
00:58:40,282 --> 00:58:42,818
And you know how to do that?

915
00:58:45,653 --> 00:58:50,326
No.

916
00:58:54,663 --> 00:58:58,233
Yeah, I know it doesn't seem
like it, but I am scared.

917
00:59:00,869 --> 00:59:02,672
Whatever happens,
I've got you.

918
00:59:07,876 --> 00:59:12,148
This would be a fabulous
time for Beth to come back.

919
00:59:13,715 --> 00:59:15,250
Well, I'm glad it's
you who's here with me.

920
00:59:17,952 --> 00:59:18,820
Me, too.

921
00:59:24,326 --> 00:59:27,096
God, how am I
falling asleep already?

922
00:59:39,307 --> 00:59:40,675
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

923
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:43,078
I'm gonna leave the light on.

924
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:44,981
Everything'll be fine, Rodger.

925
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:47,750
I'll be back soon when I'm
done grading some papers, okay?

926
00:59:47,782 --> 00:59:49,918
No, I need the light to read.

927
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:52,588
Okay.

928
00:59:54,956 --> 00:59:57,025
"'But never use that
spell, young apprentice,'

929
00:59:57,059 --> 00:59:58,694
cautioned Merlin.

930
00:59:58,726 --> 00:59:59,961
'Even in 30 years
time if you become

931
00:59:59,994 --> 01:00:01,630
a master sorcerer yourself.'

932
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:04,267
'Why?'

933
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:20,750
Merlin responded,
'Because that opens a gate

934
01:00:20,782 --> 01:00:23,118
that'll send you to
the Netherworlds.'"

935
01:00:28,056 --> 01:00:33,061
Rodger!

936
01:00:47,342 --> 01:00:48,211
Fuck.

937
01:01:25,146 --> 01:01:27,949
Opens a gate to
the Netherworlds.

938
01:01:47,068 --> 01:01:47,936
Okay.

939
01:03:00,608 --> 01:03:02,010
Horror Vacui.

940
01:03:14,889 --> 01:03:16,057
Fuck me.

941
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:17,192
There you are.

942
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:18,461
Why didn't you wake me up?

943
01:03:20,628 --> 01:03:22,331
You had another memory.

944
01:03:22,364 --> 01:03:23,932
What?

945
01:03:23,965 --> 01:03:26,234
Just a bunch of
little tiny snippets.

946
01:03:26,268 --> 01:03:27,135
And?

947
01:03:28,436 --> 01:03:30,271
I don't know, I still
can't put together

948
01:03:30,304 --> 01:03:32,007
anything substantial,
but I remember the ghost.

949
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,844
It was in my bed as a kid.

950
01:03:36,478 --> 01:03:38,847
How are we not halfway
back to campus right now?

951
01:03:43,952 --> 01:03:46,088
And what's all this stuff?

952
01:03:47,588 --> 01:03:48,891
I think this has
something to do

953
01:03:48,923 --> 01:03:50,226
with what's going on here.

954
01:03:54,028 --> 01:03:57,365
I didn't um, I didn't
ask you about your dad.

955
01:03:58,967 --> 01:04:00,403
You watched a video
of him being killed

956
01:04:02,003 --> 01:04:04,940
and I didn't even
check in with you.

957
01:04:04,972 --> 01:04:07,610
What are you talking
about, the curtain video?

958
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:09,077
Yeah.

959
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:11,513
He didn't die there, they...

960
01:04:13,047 --> 01:04:14,983
They found him at the
top of the stairs.

961
01:04:18,219 --> 01:04:20,622
What?

962
01:04:20,655 --> 01:04:21,489
Rodger, wait up.

963
01:04:21,523 --> 01:04:22,591
Where are you?

964
01:04:22,623 --> 01:04:24,259
Rodger, are you okay?

965
01:04:28,563 --> 01:04:30,032
It's not gone.

966
01:04:30,965 --> 01:04:32,300
How do you know?

967
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:34,502
Because it doesn't
just go away.

968
01:04:40,474 --> 01:04:43,112
Jordan!

969
01:04:43,144 --> 01:04:44,547
Harlot.

970
01:04:46,547 --> 01:04:47,415
Harlot.

971
01:04:50,251 --> 01:04:52,922
Let her go!

972
01:04:59,293 --> 01:05:00,328
Are you okay?

973
01:05:01,295 --> 01:05:02,364
Physically?

974
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:05,567
So that's your friend
from the shower?

975
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:06,634
Yeah.

976
01:05:06,668 --> 01:05:07,536
Come on.

977
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:15,978
All right, the videos we
found on my dad's computer

978
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:17,378
he took with his phone.

979
01:05:17,411 --> 01:05:18,246
On the night he
died he called 911.

980
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,715
Yeah.

981
01:05:19,748 --> 01:05:20,516
I'm assuming there's
another video on here.

982
01:05:20,548 --> 01:05:21,416
Okay.

983
01:05:22,717 --> 01:05:24,319
You've got some
strong coffee to make.

984
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:26,621
I got me some work to do.

985
01:05:26,655 --> 01:05:31,661
Check.

986
01:05:33,228 --> 01:05:34,596
This shouldn't
take much longer.

987
01:05:34,628 --> 01:05:35,498
Yeah.

988
01:05:39,266 --> 01:05:41,069
I'm sorry this is
happening to you.

989
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,739
You've already had to go
through so much in your life.

990
01:05:43,771 --> 01:05:44,639
Yeah.

991
01:05:47,409 --> 01:05:49,478
You know I'm always
here for you, right?

992
01:05:53,681 --> 01:05:56,685
I love you.

993
01:05:58,786 --> 01:06:00,088
There's something wrong

994
01:06:00,121 --> 01:06:01,222
with the flow of this equation.

995
01:06:01,255 --> 01:06:03,024
I just keep coming back to it.

996
01:06:45,699 --> 01:06:46,568
Oh, shit.

997
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:51,672
My mom, she created a
formula for time travel.

998
01:06:51,706 --> 01:06:53,509
No, it's the ghost.

999
01:06:57,612 --> 01:06:58,481
Is this your mom?

1000
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:11,760
Rodger.

1001
01:07:14,496 --> 01:07:19,501
Rodger.

1002
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:26,175
I think maybe we should
get some coffee in you.

1003
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,709
Horror Vacui.

1004
01:07:27,742 --> 01:07:30,813
Do you know what that means?

1005
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:32,313
Abhors a vacuum.

1006
01:07:34,181 --> 01:07:39,087
When you lose the most
precious thing in your life,

1007
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:41,590
while your father is
off fucking some whore.

1008
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:44,360
That's what you're left with.

1009
01:07:46,527 --> 01:07:47,495
The emptiness.

1010
01:07:49,396 --> 01:07:50,266
The vacuum.

1011
01:07:53,768 --> 01:07:55,771
That's a fucking horror.

1012
01:08:03,811 --> 01:08:06,214
The equation was
supposed to send her back.

1013
01:08:08,182 --> 01:08:12,153
There's this one part, this
part right here that's wrong.

1014
01:08:12,186 --> 01:08:13,822
When she applied the formula
to whatever she created

1015
01:08:13,855 --> 01:08:15,791
it didn't just send
her back in time.

1016
01:08:17,591 --> 01:08:19,228
It must've slit her between
the past and the future,

1017
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,296
in our present.

1018
01:08:21,496 --> 01:08:22,597
This is bananas.

1019
01:08:23,797 --> 01:08:25,501
Did we take ayahuasca?

1020
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:27,402
Listen to me, okay?

1021
01:08:27,435 --> 01:08:28,837
The ghost first showed up
when I was eight years old.

1022
01:08:28,869 --> 01:08:30,238
My mom vanished when I was 14.

1023
01:08:30,271 --> 01:08:31,773
That's six years.

1024
01:08:31,805 --> 01:08:33,307
She's only reappearing
now that I'm 20.

1025
01:08:33,341 --> 01:08:34,710
That's another six years.

1026
01:08:34,743 --> 01:08:36,245
So, my mom must have
traveled in time

1027
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,514
six years both
backwards and forwards.

1028
01:08:40,347 --> 01:08:41,682
I think her essence
was trying to tell me

1029
01:08:41,716 --> 01:08:43,785
that when I was a kid.

1030
01:08:43,818 --> 01:08:45,854
I don't understand.

1031
01:08:45,886 --> 01:08:46,822
Let me show you.

1032
01:08:48,422 --> 01:08:50,492
Get this, my mom time traveled

1033
01:08:50,524 --> 01:08:52,293
from this point six years ago.

1034
01:08:52,327 --> 01:08:54,195
If I got my dates correct
then she went back

1035
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:56,198
to a couple days
before Amelia's death.

1036
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:57,331
She tried to stop it.

1037
01:08:57,364 --> 01:08:58,800
The problem was she didn't start

1038
01:08:58,832 --> 01:09:00,668
moving forward in
time at the point.

1039
01:09:00,702 --> 01:09:03,838
She kept moving backwards
down the time stream.

1040
01:09:03,872 --> 01:09:05,474
Because her essence
had arrived here

1041
01:09:05,506 --> 01:09:08,376
in present day probably
about three weeks ago.

1042
01:09:09,743 --> 01:09:11,279
That's why I saw
her in the shower

1043
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:12,748
doing the exact
thing I saw as a kid.

1044
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:15,384
She's, Jordan, she's
living the same life

1045
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:18,254
moving in two different
directions down the time stream.

1046
01:09:19,753 --> 01:09:21,222
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

1047
01:09:24,225 --> 01:09:26,594
So, you saw your
mom in the shower?

1048
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:32,367
Don't, don't!

1049
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:46,949
Oswald Dultrar.

1050
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:48,951
Is she trying to say adulterer?

1051
01:09:50,752 --> 01:09:52,221
She said that to me after
she pulled you down the stairs.

1052
01:09:52,253 --> 01:09:53,721
You think she thinks I'm my dad?

1053
01:09:55,289 --> 01:09:56,591
You do look a
lot like pictures

1054
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,327
of your dad when he was younger.

1055
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:01,863
I just don't understand.

1056
01:10:01,895 --> 01:10:03,198
Is she a ghost?

1057
01:10:04,798 --> 01:10:06,568
'Cause sometimes she's solid
and sometimes she's not.

1058
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,703
- Why?
- When you split in time

1059
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:10,372
like that it's
gotta be difficult

1060
01:10:10,404 --> 01:10:11,872
for her to keep her
body and mind sound.

1061
01:10:11,905 --> 01:10:15,743
Kinda like tuning a dial
to find a radio station.

1062
01:10:15,777 --> 01:10:17,479
Eventually you find
a strong frequency,

1063
01:10:17,511 --> 01:10:19,347
but then you pass
back into static.

1064
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,682
She was there when I
was kid in the house,

1065
01:10:20,715 --> 01:10:23,385
she was just inside out.

1066
01:10:26,587 --> 01:10:27,855
This is so messed up.

1067
01:10:28,922 --> 01:10:30,425
Yeah, this is so messed up.

1068
01:10:35,329 --> 01:10:36,597
My mom messed up.

1069
01:10:36,631 --> 01:10:37,599
I just don't understand
how she coulda

1070
01:10:37,631 --> 01:10:38,600
made this kinda mistake.

1071
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:44,840
Well, she was drinking a lot.

1072
01:10:45,974 --> 01:10:47,309
Yeah, maybe, but...

1073
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:52,581
So, what are we gonna do?

1074
01:10:53,648 --> 01:10:54,682
Build a time machine?

1075
01:10:57,585 --> 01:10:59,721
Yeah, we send her back.

1076
01:11:01,389 --> 01:11:02,990
What could possibly go wrong?

1077
01:11:44,064 --> 01:11:45,933
Mom?

1078
01:11:45,966 --> 01:11:47,034
You were supposed to drive me
to the mall to meet Jordan.

1079
01:11:50,404 --> 01:11:52,474
Mom, I was supposed to
be there 40 minutes ago.

1080
01:12:44,926 --> 01:12:46,728
I'm playing with
my new friend.

1081
01:12:46,761 --> 01:12:48,563
Amelia, she's not your friend.

1082
01:12:48,595 --> 01:12:49,563
Sure she is.

1083
01:12:49,596 --> 01:12:50,831
We're playing hopscotch.

1084
01:12:50,864 --> 01:12:51,733
It's my turn.

1085
01:13:06,914 --> 01:13:09,583
- Get down!
- No, we like to play up here.

1086
01:13:09,617 --> 01:13:11,820
If I keep doing it
maybe she'll come back.

1087
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,922
You shouldn't be up
there, it's dangerous.

1088
01:13:16,623 --> 01:13:19,594
Rodger, why won't
she come back?

1089
01:13:19,627 --> 01:13:20,996
I miss her.

1090
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:23,598
Just get down before
you kill yourself.

1091
01:14:14,515 --> 01:14:16,851
Shit!

1092
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:18,619
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1093
01:14:19,787 --> 01:14:21,155
Oswald Dultrar-

1094
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:24,159
- You fucking killed
Beth, you fuck.

1095
01:14:31,832 --> 01:14:32,933
Jordan, Jordan,
come on, wake up.

1096
01:14:32,966 --> 01:14:33,934
We gotta go.

1097
01:14:33,967 --> 01:14:35,069
My mom killed Beth.

1098
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:36,704
- We gotta go.
- What?

1099
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:39,608
We gotta go now!

1100
01:14:58,659 --> 01:14:59,528
Hey.

1101
01:15:00,962 --> 01:15:03,999
I know you feel like you
have to do something.

1102
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:06,168
We made the right
decision by leaving, okay?

1103
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:09,204
Yeah, you're right.

1104
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:22,918
I'm gonna go get some coffees.

1105
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:24,953
Got a long night ahead of us.

1106
01:15:24,985 --> 01:15:25,854
Okay.

1107
01:16:50,971 --> 01:16:51,840
Okay.

1108
01:18:05,779 --> 01:18:07,381
You piece of shit.

1109
01:18:07,414 --> 01:18:09,951
I know, I'm sorry,
but you did say I think

1110
01:18:09,984 --> 01:18:11,886
we're making the
right move by leaving.

1111
01:18:11,918 --> 01:18:14,322
I meant both of us, jackass.

1112
01:18:14,354 --> 01:18:16,156
Yeah, Jordan, I know,

1113
01:18:16,189 --> 01:18:17,424
but I needed to get you
outta there to keep you safe.

1114
01:18:17,457 --> 01:18:18,326
All right?

1115
01:18:19,393 --> 01:18:20,828
What are you looking at?

1116
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:29,437
You did it, didn't you?

1117
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:31,072
Almost.

1118
01:18:31,104 --> 01:18:32,973
It doesn't quite
yet though, it's-

1119
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:35,409
- It's, it's a
compatibility issue.

1120
01:18:35,443 --> 01:18:37,244
You're using newer cables.

1121
01:18:37,278 --> 01:18:38,246
You need to use old
cables like your mom did.

1122
01:18:38,279 --> 01:18:39,147
Try it.

1123
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:04,872
Just don't hang up.

1124
01:19:04,905 --> 01:19:06,073
Stay on the phone with me.

1125
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:09,042
All right, but I
need my hands for this,

1126
01:19:09,076 --> 01:19:10,278
so you're going dark.

1127
01:19:29,997 --> 01:19:31,166
Have you seen her again?

1128
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:32,466
Not yet.

1129
01:19:34,268 --> 01:19:36,104
Have you figured out what
you're gonna do when it happens?

1130
01:19:37,904 --> 01:19:40,007
Yeah, I think so.

1131
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:43,110
I mean, I certainly hope so.

1132
01:19:43,144 --> 01:19:44,244
You
really are smarter

1133
01:19:44,278 --> 01:19:46,381
than all of us, aren't you?

1134
01:19:46,413 --> 01:19:48,248
Yeah, yet I'm still the
one here in this house.

1135
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:09,403
You're not
gonna die on me, are you?

1136
01:20:11,505 --> 01:20:13,440
You know the best
memories I have in my life

1137
01:20:13,474 --> 01:20:15,177
are from the tree
house that day.

1138
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:21,182
- Jordan.
- Yeah, me too.

1139
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:41,202
Rodger, what is going on?

1140
01:20:54,481 --> 01:20:57,085
Oswald Dultrar.

1141
01:21:11,131 --> 01:21:12,000
Fuck.

1142
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:19,140
Fuck.

1143
01:21:41,095 --> 01:21:43,365
Rodger, are you okay?

1144
01:21:44,698 --> 01:21:45,666
She
keeps phasing out.

1145
01:21:45,699 --> 01:21:46,268
I can't track her.

1146
01:21:47,635 --> 01:21:49,971
Please, Rodg,
just get outta there.

1147
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:53,408
It's, it's too dangerous.

1148
01:21:57,243 --> 01:21:58,712
It's
too unpredictable.

1149
01:21:58,746 --> 01:22:00,347
- It's like-
- It's like I need to know

1150
01:22:00,381 --> 01:22:01,950
where she's gonna
be before she...

1151
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,568
You
did it didn't you?

1152
01:22:55,536 --> 01:22:56,636
Close, the best
memories I have in my life

1153
01:22:56,670 --> 01:22:58,006
are in the tree house that day.

1154
01:22:59,707 --> 01:23:02,010
I know you feel
like you have to do something.

1155
01:23:02,042 --> 01:23:03,710
You fucking killed Beth,

1156
01:23:03,743 --> 01:23:07,014
you fuck.

1157
01:23:08,082 --> 01:23:10,352
Oswald Dultrar.

1158
01:23:11,685 --> 01:23:14,155
Get off!

1159
01:23:14,188 --> 01:23:15,757
Jordan!

1160
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:28,336
No!

1161
01:23:28,368 --> 01:23:30,771
So I said, this is
Tinder, not the Laugh Factory.

1162
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:32,407
Go find somewhere else.

1163
01:23:45,685 --> 01:23:47,688
I am sexually liberated.

1164
01:23:50,557 --> 01:23:51,692
Help!

1165
01:23:51,725 --> 01:23:53,394
No!

1166
01:23:55,162 --> 01:23:56,831
I was wanting to get
the file for Amelia.

1167
01:23:56,863 --> 01:23:58,532
When you lose the most
precious thing in your life.

1168
01:23:58,565 --> 01:24:02,170
I'm playing
with my new friend.

1169
01:24:03,369 --> 01:24:05,372
Why are you hands cold?

1170
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,311
Rodger has my pinwheel.

1171
01:26:35,021 --> 01:26:39,226
Mom, can I
go to Isla's tonight?

1172
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,728
We'll see.

1173
