00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:31,834


14
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:35,534
It's been 40 years since
King Dan-jong was killed,

15
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:36,600


16
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,667
but he had no descendants
to succeed his throne.

17
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:45,099
how could the ordinary people,
busy with their lives,

18
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:48,966
could they recall
the King's death?

19
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:50,233


20
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:52,566
Director: Shin Sang-ok
The Great Buk-ak mountain,

21
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:56,634
near the palace, remains silent.

22
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:57,634


23
00:01:57,634 --> 00:02:00,200
By the tombs

24
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,132
of the six murdered officials
loyal to the King,

25
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:08,300
the Han River flows quietly.

26
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,199


27
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,600
King Se-jo killed his nephew,
King Dan-jong

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,766
to replace him
and get on the throne.

29
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:17,400


30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,400
But after thirteen years,

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,199
King Se-jo also passed away.

32
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,266


33
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:29,866
His eldest son, Duk-jong
died before his death,

34
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:32,467
and King Se-jo's second son, Ye-jong

35
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:36,600
died after his first year as a King.

36
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,467


37
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:42,667
So Queen Jung-lim
ordered Prince Ja-san,

38
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:47,300
King Duk-jong's second son,
to accede the throne.

39
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,300
His name is King Sung-jong.

40
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,700


41
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,533
He was honored for his wit
and intelligence

42
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,300
but he also lusted after women.

43
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,133


44
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:02,433
He had three queens

45
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:03,334


46
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:05,600
and many concubines

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,633
who bore twenty-eight
princes and princesses.

48
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:12,600


49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,199
King Sung-jong's wives
grew jealous of one another,

50
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,667
and Queen Yoon,
Prince Yeon-san's mother,

51
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,734
was executed with poison.

52
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:25,567
It was a horrible event.

53
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:49,633


54
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:51,667
Come here, Concubine Jung.

55
00:03:51,667 --> 00:04:05,834


56
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:07,400
Who's next?

57
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,633
The son of Concubine Uhm.

58
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:10,667
No.

59
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,300


60
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,533
It's Prince Jin-sung.

61
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:15,667
Prince Jin-sung.

62
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,334
Where is he?

63
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:18,399


64
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,132
He's here.

65
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:22,000


66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,915
Brother, let's go.

67
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:30,367


68
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,266
This is unfair.

69
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:32,867


70
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:35,834
Mother, you should join us.

71
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:40,500


72
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,233
So that I can get
my face printed?

73
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:47,466
The King has arrived.

74
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:50,600


75
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,800
Majesty.

76
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,100
What a pleasant sight this is.

77
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,867
Father!

78
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:56,901
My brood!

79
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:59,466
Your Majesty, take time off,

80
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,666
and play with your children.

81
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,733


82
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:06,733
But where is Prince Yeon-san?

83
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:07,600


84
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,634
I heard he has worries lately,

85
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:13,600


86
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,199
he doesn't study,
and always goes hunting.

87
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,466
Is this true?

88
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:21,533
No, Majesty. Prince Yeon-san

89
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:26,533
is absorbed in his studies
day and night.

90
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:38,434


91
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:39,733
There it is!

92
00:05:39,733 --> 00:06:08,733


93
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:09,901
My lord.

94
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:10,800


95
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,867
My lord!

96
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:13,166


97
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,666
Listen to my wishes.

98
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,901
Go away,

99
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:17,199
old woman!

100
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,600
Sir.

101
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,166
Please, let me see the Prince.

102
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,766
I need to speak to him.

103
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:27,567
Please, sir.

104
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:30,199
Show me some mercy, sir.

105
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,466
No!

106
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:37,233


107
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:39,199
You heartless man.

108
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,266


109
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,800
You don't notice your grandmother,

110
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,466


111
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:47,634
and you're clueless of
your mother's unjust death.

112
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:48,266


113
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:51,567
You hopeless boy.

114
00:06:51,567 --> 00:07:43,100


115
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,199
Your Majesty,

116
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,132


117
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,533
I heard the prince killed
a man while hunting today.

118
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:50,800
Are you aware of this?

119
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,334
Yes. I know, mother.

120
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:56,701
Even a common man
wouldn't be this cruel.

121
00:07:56,701 --> 00:08:00,800
How can our future King
kill a man like this?

122
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,834
I learned that

123
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:08,901
when he saw a soldier kill
a calf looking for its mother,

124
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:12,367
he became furious
and killed the soldier.

125
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,334
Is this true?

126
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:16,567
Yes. His murder is unacceptable,

127
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:21,134
but even if the calf is just an
animal looking for its mother,

128
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,300
the soldier was wrong to kill it.

129
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,201


130
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:27,367
A calf looking for its mother?

131
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:28,334
Yes.

132
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:31,466


133
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:34,667
His behavior is suspicious these days.

134
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:35,958


135
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:42,167
Could he know that the queen
is not his natural mother?

136
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,500
I'm not sure.

137
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,067


138
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,999
Don't worry, mother.

139
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:50,933
I will look into it,
and keep him under control.

140
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:53,567
When we deposed his mother,

141
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,100


142
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,767
we should've deposed him, too.

143
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:58,399


144
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,133
We would be free of trouble.

145
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:11,767


146
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,500
Here is the kayagum, Prince.

147
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,234


148
00:09:15,234 --> 00:09:16,201
Uncle,

149
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:17,299


150
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:18,734
play a tune.

151
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:19,701


152
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:20,734
No.

153
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:23,100


154
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,134
Not today.

155
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:28,200
Good players choose their listeners,

156
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,701
but please play for your nephew.

157
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:32,100


158
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,533
I feel bad lately,
and I miss your music.

159
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,966


160
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:39,999
I can't.

161
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:40,299
Why can't you?

162
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:42,567


163
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,734
Today is May 16.

164
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:50,100


165
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,200
It's the queen's memorial.

166
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,167


167
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:56,100
Here.

168
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,734


169
00:09:57,734 --> 00:09:59,600
Let's just have a drink.

170
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,267
What do you mean by
the queen's memorial?

171
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:03,833
My mother is alive.

172
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:07,100


173
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,734
You mean Queen Yoon
who was deposed and poisoned?

174
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,133


175
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:14,734
Why do you feel
sorry for a criminal?

176
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:16,133


177
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,333
She was my sister-in-law,

178
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,833


179
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,866
and she adored me.

180
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:25,734


181
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:26,767
Uncle.

182
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:30,799


183
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,299
Uncle.

184
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,167
Why was she executed?

185
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,134
I don't know.

186
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:38,269
- Please, tell me.
- I don't know.

187
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:40,366
- Please, tell me.
- I really don't know.

188
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:42,201


189
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:45,701
When she was queen,
didn't she have a child?

190
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:50,432


191
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:51,966
Blood will tell.

192
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:53,399


193
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,999
Blood will tell?

194
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:56,399


195
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,399
Never mind.

196
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,634


197
00:10:58,634 --> 00:10:59,633
Never mind.

198
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:03,866


199
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:05,201
Blood will tell?

200
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:16,067


201
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:18,500
You've gotten better.

202
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,900


203
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,833
How is it, mother?

204
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,833
What is the prize

205
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:27,833


206
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,634
you promised me?

207
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:31,833
Dried persimmons.

208
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:32,533


209
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:34,432
That's all, mother?

210
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:34,966


211
00:11:34,966 --> 00:11:37,067
Then a bottle of liquor.

212
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:38,667


213
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:39,700
Mother.

214
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,799


215
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,866
Here.

216
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:43,033


217
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:44,201
What?

218
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:48,167


219
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,167
Stand back.

220
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,432


221
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:51,600
Prince,

222
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,134


223
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:54,600
why are you here?

224
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,479


225
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:58,033
- Need to speak to me?
- It's nothing.

226
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:58,833


227
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:03,433
Then please
come and play with Jin-sung.

228
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:05,033
Brother, please come.

229
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:08,399


230
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,600
Prince!

231
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,933


232
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:17,500
Blood will tell.

233
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:26,400


234
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,667
Mother!

235
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,833


236
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,000
Mother.

237
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,500


238
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,734
Mother.

239
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:41,734


240
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:42,866
Mother,

241
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:43,567


242
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:47,634
how can I live without
someone to rely on?

243
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,700


244
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,033
Oh, Mother.

245
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:52,167


246
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:53,100
My son.

247
00:12:53,100 --> 00:13:36,700


248
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,134
The night is so cold.

249
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:41,134
Turn off the lamp.

250
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:42,398
Turn it off.

251
00:13:42,398 --> 00:13:46,167


252
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,767
- Ja-Won.
- My lord?

253
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:48,899


254
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:53,833
If you don't tell me the truth,
I'll cut off your head.

255
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,700
I will.

256
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,732


257
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:57,933
Ever seen the deposed queen?

258
00:13:57,933 --> 00:14:01,167


259
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,433
Why are you silent?

260
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:03,500


261
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,301
Then I'll put
my sword to your neck?

262
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:07,033


263
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,500
Prince.

264
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Prince.

265
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500


266
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,201
Go on.

267
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:14,866
Yes, I've seen her.

268
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:15,767


269
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:19,100
What did her face look like?
Was it round or long?

270
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,234


271
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,799
Her skin was white and slender.

272
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,067
What else?

273
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:27,433
She looked kind.

274
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:33,000
And her body was slim and refined.

275
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,301
Did she have a child?

276
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:38,767
My lord, I'm sorry, but I can't say.

277
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,033
Answer me now.

278
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:42,466
Yes, I will lord.

279
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,201


280
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:45,400
Hurry.

281
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,336
My lord, you're her only son.

282
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:59,267


283
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:03,100
So I'm the son of a sinner.

284
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,866
My lord,

285
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:07,734
my life is in your hands now.

286
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:11,234
Why was she deposed?
Why did they poison her?

287
00:15:11,234 --> 00:15:14,433
My lord, I can't answer.

288
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:18,433
The King ordered anyone
who reveals the queen's past

289
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:18,966


290
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:21,966
to be hacked into pieces.

291
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:24,267
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

292
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:26,201


293
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:27,301
Alright.

294
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,000
Tell me.

295
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,067


296
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:34,033
She was deposed because
she scarred the King's face

297
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,732


298
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:37,567
The King's face?

299
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:38,701
Yes.

300
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:42,301
My lord, please be careful.

301
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:46,366
If people discover that you
know of your mother's death,

302
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:48,067
your position will be in danger.

303
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:50,933
- In danger?
- Yes,

304
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:55,333
they might take your crown away.

305
00:15:55,333 --> 00:16:00,167
They're watching every move you make.

306
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,466
Really?

307
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:08,561
You should become closer
with the queen and Prince Jin-sung.

308
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:09,267


309
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:13,567
You should act

310
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,234
like you don't know this secret.

311
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:18,899
How could I, if I know the truth?

312
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,433
How can I even keep
a smile on my face?

313
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:24,500
My lord, your voice is too loud.

314
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,167


315
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:34,932
My lord, wait until you
accede to the throne.

316
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:38,466
All the people of this country

317
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:41,533
are relying on your future.

318
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,433
So please consider it.

319
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:44,400


320
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,333
It's for your future.

321
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,333


322
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,366
My lord,

323
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:51,932


324
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:55,000
it's late, we should go back.

325
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,567


326
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,200
Leave me alone.

327
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,667


328
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,234
Leave me alone.

329
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:12,200


330
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,267
Oh, there's Yeon-san!

331
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:17,401


332
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:18,467
Yeon-san.

333
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:21,200


334
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,166
The King is coming. Please, get up.

335
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,233
Son.

336
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:26,067


337
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:29,401
Raising this dear early was worth it.

338
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:30,634


339
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:34,634
Listen carefully.
The reason I raised this deer

340
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:37,433
is to follow the example

341
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:40,500
of King Moon in China

342
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,067
whose hobby was to breed
a deer, as a sign of nobility.

343
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:48,534
As I expected,
my prince is sentient.

344
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:52,299
It's so meek and
obedient to a human.

345
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:56,200
No other animal
is smarter than a deer.

346
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,900


347
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,967
What are you doing?

348
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:05,634


349
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:09,500
It's an obedient animal
that does you no harm,

350
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,567
and you kick it for no reason?

351
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:13,500


352
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,267
How can you be so cruel?

353
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:16,601


354
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:20,467
Is that crueler than a saint

355
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,567
poisoning his obedient disciple?

356
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:23,433


357
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:25,534
Go to the royal school

358
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:29,433
and read Mencius

359
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:30,166


360
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,267
to think over what you just did.

361
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:49,932


362
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:52,666
Read, my lord.

363
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,932
You'll never finish
by midnight at this pace.

364
00:18:56,932 --> 00:18:59,567


365
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:02,634
Please read it from the beginning.

366
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:03,932


367
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:08,901
He creates the law and order,

368
00:19:08,901 --> 00:19:13,099
and rules his country with them.

369
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:18,267
All the people followed his way

370
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:19,099


371
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:23,800
at a younger age than me

372
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,733


373
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:31,166
They respected him as a father.

374
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,000


375
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,601
Please, continue.

376
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:34,467


377
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:38,267
All of this is nonsense.

378
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:39,866
What?

379
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:41,232
I don't want to read.

380
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:43,166


381
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:47,267
If you refuse to study,
I will tell it to the King.

382
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:55,467


383
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:56,500
My lord,

384
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,200


385
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,366
if you feel tired
take a short break first.

386
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,467
I think he despises me

387
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:04,500


388
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,567
since I'm a sinner's son.

389
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,200


390
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,299
We'll see about that.

391
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:12,534
How dare he throw this book at me?

392
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:49,601


393
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:50,634
Mother,

394
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:52,567


395
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:55,233
what sin forced you
to get buried here.

396
00:20:55,233 --> 00:21:00,299


397
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,701
I resent you for passing on
your sin to me.

398
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:05,999


399
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,967
With this disgrace on me,

400
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,500
I'm forever a sinner's son.

401
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,967
Even though I become King,

402
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:15,634
how can I rule with honor?

403
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:16,400


404
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,666
Mother.

405
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:21,366


406
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:22,866
Mother.

407
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:55,166


408
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,834
King Sung-jong
ruled for 25 years.

409
00:21:58,834 --> 00:21:59,666


410
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:03,634
On December 25, 1494

411
00:22:03,634 --> 00:22:06,334
he died,
at the young age of 38.

412
00:22:06,334 --> 00:22:07,099


413
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:11,500
After Prince Yeon-san led
the funeral, he became King.

414
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,267


415
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:17,534
Speak, Your Majesty.

416
00:22:17,534 --> 00:22:19,433


417
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:23,467
My mother committed
a sin to the last King,

418
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,299


419
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,767
and died as a deposed queen.

420
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:31,433
My father's order was
passed before his death.

421
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,701
So she should be forgiven.

422
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:36,933
I'm King of this country now.

423
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:39,866
But if my mother's
tomb remains disgraced,

424
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:44,601
neither I nor my mother's
ghost can be at ease.

425
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:45,701
So then?

426
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:49,400
So please forgive her crime,

427
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,767
and have her buried
beside my father's royal tomb.

428
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:53,634


429
00:22:53,634 --> 00:22:55,299
Please allow it.

430
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:57,733


431
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:58,767
I can't.

432
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:00,334


433
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:00,866
What?

434
00:23:00,866 --> 00:23:02,232


435
00:23:02,232 --> 00:23:07,701
She's a criminal that was
exiled by the last King.

436
00:23:07,701 --> 00:23:08,666


437
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,400
It's impossible.

438
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,366


439
00:23:11,366 --> 00:23:13,834
Your father would never allow it.

440
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:15,866


441
00:23:15,866 --> 00:23:20,666
Please consider this as a son's duty.

442
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,733
I told you it's impossible.

443
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:23,634


444
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:27,133
Think about your dignity as a King.

445
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:28,166


446
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:30,864
Consider every matter carefully.

447
00:23:30,864 --> 00:23:38,299


448
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:39,500
In that case,

449
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,433


450
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:45,299
if moving her tomb is
dishonorable as a King,

451
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,467


452
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,701
I want an ordinary shrine

453
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:50,299


454
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:52,400
built for her at least.

455
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,634


456
00:23:58,634 --> 00:24:01,433
Discuss it with the court.

457
00:24:01,433 --> 00:24:03,567


458
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,467
Why are you silent?

459
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:12,334


460
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:13,733
What's your answer Minister Yoon?

461
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:15,800


462
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,200
I agree with Your Majesty.

463
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,666


464
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:23,334
What about you?

465
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:23,866


466
00:24:23,866 --> 00:24:26,467
Your Majesty is right.

467
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:27,601


468
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:31,767
I'm glad to hear you all agree.

469
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,967
I will name it the
"shrine of filial piety",

470
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:36,534
and call the tomb "Hui".

471
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:40,567


472
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:43,366
I will speak, Your Majesty.

473
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:48,767
Forgive my words.

474
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:50,099
What is it?

475
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:51,700


476
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,767
Queen Yoon was dignified,

477
00:24:56,767 --> 00:25:01,334
so it's right to change
her tomb into an honorable one.

478
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,567
But the last King deposed her,

479
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:08,227
so it is disrespectful to do this.

480
00:25:08,227 --> 00:25:08,866


481
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:09,967
What?

482
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:10,433


483
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:15,467
No matter how much pity
you feel for the queen,

484
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:20,567
Your Majesty can't treat this
as a personal matter.

485
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:24,901
Even if a shrine
or tomb aren't built,

486
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:28,634
you can still hold
a memorial for your mother.

487
00:25:28,634 --> 00:25:32,299
And if you hold it
at her present tomb,

488
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:35,299
you will fulfill your filial duty.

489
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:39,567
Please don't do things
unfit for royal custom,

490
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:44,567
find another way
to fulfill your filial obligation.

491
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:45,133


492
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:46,700
What?

493
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,767
Listen: What makes you so sure?

494
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:53,567
Who made our custom?

495
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:55,634
Isn't it made by human beings?

496
00:25:55,634 --> 00:25:57,999


497
00:25:57,999 --> 00:25:59,901
If a custom doesn't serve
justice or loyalty

498
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:02,834
then it's not a good custom.

499
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:05,567


500
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:08,166
As a human being, I'll make my own.

501
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,634
Your Majesty,

502
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:13,834
a custom is not made
by an individual.

503
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:16,866
It becomes a custom

504
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,901
if everyone agrees on it.

505
00:26:19,901 --> 00:26:23,666


506
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:29,634
I speak for all the officials,
Your Majesty.

507
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:32,166
Forgive me for saying this,

508
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:34,933
but I cannot obey
Your Majesty's wish,

509
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:37,799
to change her tomb
into a honorable one.

510
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:38,500


511
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,532
What?

512
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:41,999


513
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:45,933
According to
the last King's command,

514
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:47,901
even after 100 years

515
00:26:47,901 --> 00:26:52,767
we must not change his ways
and always obey them.

516
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:57,999
Why are you disobeying
your father's last command?

517
00:26:57,999 --> 00:53:55,598


518
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,567
If building a shrine
is against the last King's will,

519
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:05,666
we cannot permit
Your Majesty's wish.

520
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,567


521
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:10,933
Don't you all
have mothers, too?

522
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:16,834


523
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:18,201
Imbeciles.

524
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:40,866


525
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:42,933
The King
has arrived.

526
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:58,866


527
00:27:58,866 --> 00:28:01,967
What's wrong, Your Majesty?

528
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:02,733


529
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:06,532
How could they do this
to me, my darling?

530
00:28:06,532 --> 00:28:07,401


531
00:28:07,401 --> 00:28:09,401
They rejected to enshrine my mother.

532
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:11,799


533
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:14,599
What's my right as a King?

534
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,201
Is a King born from the sky
instead of a mother's womb?

535
00:28:18,201 --> 00:28:19,101


536
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:22,999
They have no compassion.

537
00:28:22,999 --> 00:56:45,732


538
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:23,834
My darling,

539
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:24,634


540
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:27,599
I was raised without my real mother.

541
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:29,567


542
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:32,532
I had to hide my true feelings.

543
00:28:32,532 --> 00:28:33,034


544
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:37,599
Know how sad
and lonely I spent my life?

545
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:42,166


546
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:43,500
My darling,

547
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,733


548
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:46,933
let's give everything up,

549
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:47,532


550
00:28:47,532 --> 00:28:49,567
and live a normal life.

551
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:50,634


552
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:53,432
I can fulfill my duty as a son

553
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:54,900


554
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,067
for my poor mother's soul.

555
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:57,799


556
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:00,432
Let's go together, alright?

557
00:29:00,432 --> 00:29:01,834


558
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:02,901
My darling.

559
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:05,700
Your Majesty, let's think it over.

560
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,767


561
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:10,666
It'll be better
if we wait a bit longer.

562
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,967


563
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:15,101
You crazy old hag!

564
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:19,034
Please ask your lord.

565
00:29:19,034 --> 00:29:21,866
- He'll know who I am.
- Go away!

566
00:29:21,866 --> 00:29:24,901
Give me some food at least.

567
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:28,532
I told you he isn't in, old hag!

568
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:34,201
He'll know me,
but you kick me out like this.

569
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:35,700


570
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,634
What's all this noise out here?

571
00:29:39,634 --> 00:29:40,467


572
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:42,233
Just a crazy old woman.

573
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:44,567
She says she's the King's
grandmother.

574
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:45,901
The King's grandmother?

575
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:46,901
Yes.

576
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:47,567


577
00:29:47,567 --> 00:29:49,799
She must be lying, my lord.

578
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,067


579
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:54,532
I can't believe she's still alive.

580
00:29:54,532 --> 00:29:55,067


581
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:58,767
Let me see.
Sure she called herself that?

582
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:00,432
Yes.

583
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,733
If it's true, then I'm lucky.

584
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:04,634
Go find her.

585
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:06,933
- Why?
- Just find her quickly!

586
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:07,967
Yes, my lord.

587
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:18,067


588
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,666
How can I find her?

589
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,900


590
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,201
Even if you have to search
everywhere, you have to find her.

591
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,500
Yes, my lord.

592
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,134


593
00:30:28,134 --> 00:30:29,134
One more thing.

594
00:30:29,134 --> 00:30:30,633


595
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:34,700
Someone else may be looking for her.

596
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,467
So find her quickly.

597
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,509
Yes, my lord.

598
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:49,300


599
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,933
Listen!

600
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,300


601
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,433
Do you have to dishonor
the King's mother?

602
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:56,401


603
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:58,500
Think it over.

604
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,099
Your Majesty is right.

605
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:01,401
What's right?

606
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,767
Is it right to do it or not?

607
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:08,500
It's right to enshrine
your mother, Your Majesty.

608
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,034
Listen to me, ministers.

609
00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:12,833
You may oppose me

610
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:15,099
but I'll never change my mind.

611
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:17,933
Enshrining my mother's tomb,

612
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:20,334
is my custom and duty.

613
00:31:20,334 --> 00:31:22,267
Your Majesty is right.

614
00:31:22,267 --> 00:31:24,134
Minister of finance,

615
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:25,433
don't worry about the cost.

616
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:29,700
Build her shrine behind Jong-bu
temple, with the best materials.

617
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,500


618
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,300
Minister of affairs.

619
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,933
First, I'll go to my mother's
tomb and perform a memorial.

620
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:42,134
So prepare all the materials
that I need.

621
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:48,366


622
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:52,500
If someone resists me

623
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,401
I will punish him severely.

624
00:31:54,401 --> 00:32:03,467


625
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:06,700
Queen Mother, what should we do?

626
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,767
The royal judges and inspectors
came to contest the King.

627
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:15,334
The royal scholars
also came to defy him.

628
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:19,467
They won't leave the palace

629
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:21,833
until the King cancels his order.

630
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:24,967
They're protesting this very moment.

631
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:30,833


632
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:32,500
Your Majesty,

633
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,732
their words are right.

634
00:32:36,732 --> 00:32:39,967
The deposed queen
is your natural mother,

635
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:45,433
but Your Majesty should never
admit her into the royal family.

636
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:50,300
Forgive me Your Majesty,
but please cancel your order.

637
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,833


638
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:59,099
More protest letters,
Your Majesty.

639
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:00,099


640
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:01,366
From Cholla province.

641
00:33:01,366 --> 00:33:04,334
Don't they have parents, too?

642
00:33:04,334 --> 00:33:06,900


643
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,866
Ignore the ones good
at following laws and custom.

644
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:11,866


645
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:15,401
I'm the King of this land.
I'll do as I please.

646
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:15,933


647
00:33:15,933 --> 00:33:17,767
Just burn the letters.

648
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:21,732
- Your words reign supreme.
- Queen Mother has arrived.

649
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:25,534


650
00:33:25,534 --> 00:33:26,433
Your Majesty.

651
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:27,433


652
00:33:27,433 --> 00:33:32,000
This dynasty is not yours,
but your ancestors.

653
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,799


654
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,900
This country is not yours
but your ancestors.

655
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,866
It's for the people living here.

656
00:33:38,866 --> 00:33:39,732


657
00:33:39,732 --> 00:33:43,433
Know what dignity
and royalty stands for?

658
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:44,500


659
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,866
Perform a memorial?

660
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:51,433
How can a King perform
a memorial at a sinner's tomb?

661
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:52,401


662
00:33:52,401 --> 00:33:54,700
I'm doing it not as a King,

663
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,732


664
00:33:55,732 --> 00:33:57,732
but as a dutiful son.

665
00:33:57,732 --> 00:33:59,034


666
00:33:59,034 --> 00:34:03,267
So is it wrong to perform
a memorial for my mother?

667
00:34:03,267 --> 00:34:04,967


668
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:07,334
Your throne is not your own.

669
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:08,099


670
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:12,034
So you can't act as you please.

671
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:14,034


672
00:34:14,034 --> 00:34:16,833
Consider the royal family's honor,

673
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:19,367
and your ancestors.

674
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:21,367


675
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:27,936
Consider all the people
who respect you as a father.

676
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:28,666


677
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:33,367
Why did you put
a sinner's son on the throne,

678
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:37,434
and forbid
my filial duty as a son.

679
00:34:37,434 --> 00:34:39,501
Even as a human being?

680
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:40,666


681
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:45,666
How could you speak rudely to me?

682
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,434
I'm sick of it,

683
00:34:47,434 --> 00:34:51,467
I'm sick of this throne,
this wealth and honor.

684
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:53,567
If I'm denied my filial duty

685
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:54,099


686
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:56,637
because of an unjust law and custom,

687
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:59,934
I'd rather be a criminal,

688
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:03,032
and be like a real son,

689
00:35:03,032 --> 00:35:03,800


690
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,199
to serve with my hands

691
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:06,967


692
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:09,900
a warm bowl of rice
at my poor mother's tomb.

693
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,300


694
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,601
Please answer to my wishes.

695
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:16,601
Please,

696
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:17,467


697
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:18,701
Grandmother.

698
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:19,932


699
00:35:19,932 --> 00:35:20,900
I beg you.

700
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,867


701
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:22,833
Never!

702
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:25,400


703
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
Until I die,

704
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400


705
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,067
until the day I die,

706
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:34,567
you'll never perform
a memorial for her.

707
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:49,199


708
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,333
Stay strong, Your Majesty.

709
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:52,967


710
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:58,166
No one can actually forbid
the King's wishes.

711
00:35:58,166 --> 00:35:59,634
Stay strong.

712
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:19,833


713
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:20,900
Ja-won.

714
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,967
Yes?

715
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:23,867


716
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:26,300
Tell the head courtesan
to prepare a party.

717
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,134


718
00:36:27,134 --> 00:36:29,666
Call every courtesan there is.

719
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:30,900


720
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,032
Drinking, dancing,
and playing with women

721
00:36:34,032 --> 00:36:36,666
isn't against our custom, right?

722
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:37,300


723
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,333
Got it?

724
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:39,099


725
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:42,367
I'll do as you wish.

726
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:49,233


727
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:52,367
Can't you excite me more?

728
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:53,833


729
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,900
- Of course, Your Majesty.
- How?

730
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,233


731
00:36:57,233 --> 00:36:58,501
Majesty.

732
00:36:58,501 --> 00:36:59,601


733
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:04,134
It's past midnight,
so please rest.

734
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:05,067


735
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:06,434
Alright.

736
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:07,400


737
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,800
Let's go to my chambers,

738
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,434
and I'll teach you my own custom.

739
00:37:13,434 --> 00:37:14,134


740
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:16,601
Your Majesty, that's too vulgar!

741
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,199
Why is it vulgar?

742
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,666


743
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:21,400
Forgive us, Your Majesty.

744
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,199


745
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,900
Forgive what?

746
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:33,934


747
00:37:33,934 --> 00:37:35,534
Cowards,

748
00:37:35,534 --> 00:37:39,534
I should fix your mouths
with a hammer.

749
00:37:39,534 --> 00:37:44,266
So you'll never repeat
dumb words like "forgive me".

750
00:37:44,266 --> 00:37:47,634


751
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:49,001
Listen carefully.

752
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:49,934


753
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:55,101
All of you were born
from vulgar things.

754
00:37:55,101 --> 00:37:59,467
If you think it's vulgar,
vulgar also is your life!

755
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:02,567


756
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:04,400
Now, let's go in.

757
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,800


758
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,567
This moment
we'll enjoy.

759
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:11,833


760
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:16,934
Queen mother is very upset now.

761
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:21,400
She ordered Your Majesty
to stop playing and rest.

762
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,367


763
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:26,300
It's been a month
since you've been drinking

764
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,201
without any rest.

765
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:28,733


766
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:34,800
The last King's deer
looks to be worried, too.

767
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,766
It comes out,
and looks up at Your Majesty.

768
00:38:38,766 --> 00:39:56,900


769
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,400
What's that sound?

770
00:39:58,400 --> 00:41:34,367


771
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,432
Your Majesty!

772
00:41:36,432 --> 00:41:46,867


773
00:41:46,867 --> 00:41:48,967
Come and sit, Your Majesty.

774
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:52,400


775
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,634
What brings His Majesty here?

776
00:41:54,634 --> 00:41:56,001
Very nice.

777
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:56,833


778
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:58,567
You're stingy, uncle.

779
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:01,867
How could you enjoy
this party alone?

780
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:04,333


781
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:07,699
This party is for a fool like me.

782
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:10,733
Your Majesty mustn't attend,

783
00:42:10,733 --> 00:42:11,400


784
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,534
if so, who will rule?

785
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:16,300


786
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,666
Have a drink.

787
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:21,567


788
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,067
Fill His Majesty's glass.

789
00:42:23,067 --> 00:42:34,599


790
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:35,666
What's your name?

791
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:38,300


792
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,400
Jang Nok-soo.

793
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,934


794
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,800
So you're Jang Nok-soo!

795
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,300


796
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,534
Yes, Your Majesty.

797
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:50,300
Uncle, give her to me.

798
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,599


799
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:57,101
If you adore her, she's yours.

800
00:42:57,101 --> 00:42:58,034


801
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:01,201
But Your Majesty,

802
00:43:01,201 --> 00:43:02,166


803
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:07,699
you should adore her like me,
and do it forever.

804
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:08,900


805
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:13,432
If you let me,
I'll adore her till I die.

806
00:43:13,432 --> 00:43:16,934


807
00:43:16,934 --> 00:43:17,967
Here.

808
00:43:17,967 --> 00:45:04,766


809
00:45:04,766 --> 00:45:05,800
Nok-soo.

810
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,400


811
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,733
Your Majesty.

812
00:45:08,733 --> 00:45:09,599


813
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,300
Don't ever leave me,
and love me forever.

814
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,699
Of course.

815
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:18,733


816
00:45:18,733 --> 00:45:19,833
Nok-soo.

817
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:46,199


818
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:48,601
You're not like usual.

819
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:51,233


820
00:45:51,233 --> 00:45:56,400
How could you protect
the King like this?

821
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:05,400


822
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,867
You brats!

823
00:46:06,867 --> 00:46:12,233


824
00:46:12,233 --> 00:46:13,867
Come here.

825
00:46:13,867 --> 00:46:14,856


826
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:16,717
You bastards!

827
00:46:16,717 --> 00:46:22,699


828
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:24,599
You brats.

829
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:32,101


830
00:46:32,101 --> 00:46:36,760
You brats! Give it back!

831
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,463


832
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:39,940
There she is.

833
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:49,967


834
00:46:49,967 --> 00:46:51,967
My husband.

835
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:55,300
Your daughter came out of the palace.

836
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,833
- Come here.
- Father.

837
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:58,300


838
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,699
What's wrong?

839
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:03,333
I quit my service and came out.

840
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:05,900
Sister, is this true ?

841
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,967
Yes.

842
00:47:06,967 --> 00:47:07,632


843
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:12,666
The King is so furious these days

844
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:13,400


845
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,199
because of the deposed Queen Yoon.

846
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:20,300
A few days ago,
the King killed

847
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:25,699
his father's beloved deer,

848
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:26,701


849
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:30,800
and took in his uncle's concubine.

850
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,367
How could he do that?

851
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:34,867
I'm glad you left.

852
00:47:34,867 --> 00:47:38,166


853
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:40,367
This country is in danger.

854
00:47:40,367 --> 00:47:44,166


855
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:47,367
- What is this?
- Could it be important?

856
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:54,233


857
00:47:54,233 --> 00:47:55,699
Give it to me.

858
00:47:55,699 --> 00:47:58,300


859
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,733
Oh, my goodness.

860
00:47:59,733 --> 00:48:00,300


861
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,367
Aren't you Madam Shin?

862
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:03,567


863
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:05,900
Aren't you
the King's grandmother?

864
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:06,766


865
00:48:06,766 --> 00:48:08,067
Yes, I am,

866
00:48:08,067 --> 00:48:08,733


867
00:48:08,733 --> 00:48:10,900
but I don't recognize you.

868
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,067
Minister Park Se-won.

869
00:48:14,067 --> 00:48:15,967
- Minister Park?
- Yes.

870
00:48:15,967 --> 00:48:16,567


871
00:48:16,567 --> 00:48:20,802
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.
What happened to you?

872
00:48:20,802 --> 00:48:23,599


873
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:28,867
I've grown old to wander
shamefully like this.

874
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:31,000


875
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,333
Hurry and escort her inside.

876
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:34,467


877
00:48:34,467 --> 00:48:36,000
Please, come inside.

878
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,233


879
00:48:37,233 --> 00:48:39,737
Thank you so much.

880
00:48:39,737 --> 00:48:41,000
I'm so grateful.

881
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:51,367


882
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:53,099
- Did it go well?
- Yes, my lord.

883
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:54,166
Give it to me.

884
00:48:54,166 --> 00:49:02,101


885
00:49:02,101 --> 00:49:03,333
All right.

886
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:04,400


887
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,257
I will give you money.

888
00:49:06,257 --> 00:49:12,000
So find four or five reliable men
who are strong

889
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,034


890
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:14,967
and good swordsmen.

891
00:49:14,967 --> 00:49:16,134
Yes, my lord.

892
00:49:16,134 --> 00:49:18,166


893
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:20,900
If my plan goes well

894
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,666


895
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:25,932
and the King rewards me,

896
00:49:25,932 --> 00:49:28,067
this crime is worthwhile.

897
00:49:28,067 --> 00:49:29,934
Let's go outside.

898
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:31,400


899
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,501
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

900
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:34,601


901
00:49:34,601 --> 00:49:39,233
If it's true, we should
take her out of there tonight.

902
00:49:39,233 --> 00:49:40,000


903
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
We can do it.

904
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,233


905
00:49:44,233 --> 00:49:45,367
But...

906
00:49:45,367 --> 00:49:46,032


907
00:49:46,032 --> 00:49:47,166
What is it?

908
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:51,266
It would cost more money.

909
00:49:51,266 --> 00:49:51,967


910
00:49:51,967 --> 00:49:57,266
Don't worry about money.
Just do your best.

911
00:49:57,266 --> 00:49:58,199
Yes, sir.

912
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:58,661


913
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:00,608
One more thing...

914
00:50:00,608 --> 00:50:02,666


915
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,601
Are you asleep, Madam Shin?

916
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,532


917
00:50:06,532 --> 00:50:07,666
Who is it?

918
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:09,233


919
00:50:09,233 --> 00:50:11,634
You're in danger.

920
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:12,501


921
00:50:12,501 --> 00:50:15,032
- Leave quickly.
- Why?

922
00:50:15,032 --> 00:50:18,567
Minister Park is trying to kill you.

923
00:50:18,567 --> 00:50:20,166
Please come quickly.

924
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:22,000
He's trying to kill me?

925
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,501
If you meet the King,
Minister Park will be punished.

926
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:29,967
That's why he's holding you.

927
00:50:29,967 --> 00:50:31,233
Please come quickly.

928
00:50:31,233 --> 00:50:42,967


929
00:50:42,967 --> 00:50:43,900
That way.

930
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,166


931
00:50:46,166 --> 00:50:47,900
Over here.

932
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:58,333


933
00:50:58,333 --> 00:50:59,601
Thank you.

934
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:04,300


935
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,932
Please get on.

936
00:51:05,932 --> 00:51:08,000


937
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,534
Let's go.

938
00:51:09,534 --> 00:51:46,666


939
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,034
Don't move!

940
00:51:48,034 --> 00:51:49,701
Who the hell are you?

941
00:51:49,701 --> 00:52:08,199


942
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:09,266
Lift her up.

943
00:52:09,266 --> 00:52:24,400


944
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,900
My lord!

945
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,099
What happened to you?

946
00:52:28,099 --> 00:52:32,233


947
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:33,434
Tell me.

948
00:52:33,434 --> 00:52:36,434
I'm sorry, my lord.

949
00:52:36,434 --> 00:52:37,000


950
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,967
They took her away from us.

951
00:52:39,967 --> 00:52:43,333
What? Who took her away?

952
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:44,199


953
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:46,666
They hid their faces

954
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:49,333
so I couldn't recognize them.

955
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,199


956
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:52,601
This is serious.

957
00:52:52,601 --> 00:52:53,534


958
00:52:53,534 --> 00:52:55,199
What should I do?

959
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:56,501


960
00:52:56,501 --> 00:53:00,900
Meanwhile,
Nok-soo stole the King's heart,

961
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,367
and became a concubine.

962
00:53:03,367 --> 00:53:06,300
Her home was flooded with wealth.

963
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,467
The King gave her
many jewelry and gold,

964
00:53:09,467 --> 00:53:12,367
All the governors
gave her property as bribery

965
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:15,400
and it was worth more
than their taxes.

966
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,634
Come here.

967
00:53:16,634 --> 00:53:18,932


968
00:53:18,932 --> 00:53:20,666
Who sent this?

969
00:53:20,666 --> 00:53:24,467
My goodness, it's beautiful.

970
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:28,300
It's from Poong-chun palace.

971
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,501
What?

972
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:31,266
- Poong-chun palace?
- Yes, Madam.

973
00:53:31,266 --> 00:53:32,467


974
00:53:32,467 --> 00:53:35,032
From Lady Hyun-sook?

975
00:53:35,032 --> 00:53:37,000
Yes, Madam.

976
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,166
From Lord Lim Sa-hong's wife.

977
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:41,300
I see.

978
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,932


979
00:53:42,932 --> 00:53:46,434
Isn't Lady Hyun-sook,
the King's aunt.

980
00:53:46,434 --> 00:53:47,501
Yes, Madam.

981
00:53:47,501 --> 00:53:50,333


982
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:52,534
Another governor probably

983
00:53:52,534 --> 00:53:55,567
used her to give it to me.

984
00:53:55,567 --> 00:54:00,932


985
00:54:00,932 --> 00:54:04,333
I've seen a similar jewel

986
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:06,900
on the Queen's skirt.

987
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,434
But it's nothing compared to this.

988
00:54:09,434 --> 00:54:12,367
Be quiet. You're too noisy.

989
00:54:12,367 --> 00:54:13,634


990
00:54:13,634 --> 00:54:16,300
But who's Madam Shin?

991
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,634
I'm not sure, Madam.

992
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:19,333


993
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:22,367
Maybe Lord Lim's concubine?

994
00:54:22,367 --> 00:54:23,467
Maybe.

995
00:54:23,467 --> 00:54:26,467


996
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:29,567
Tomorrow is
Lady Hyun-sook's birthday.

997
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:31,266
Really?

998
00:54:31,266 --> 00:54:32,900
They invited me.

999
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:52,467


1000
00:54:52,467 --> 00:54:56,134
Welcome.
Thank you for coming.

1001
00:54:56,134 --> 00:54:57,367
My pleasure.

1002
00:54:57,367 --> 00:55:00,000
Please, come inside.

1003
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:16,934


1004
00:55:16,934 --> 00:55:20,800
It's not much,
but please help yourself.

1005
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,032
It's so much.

1006
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:25,766
- Please.
- Thank you.

1007
00:55:25,766 --> 00:55:29,434


1008
00:55:29,434 --> 00:55:30,534
My dear friend,

1009
00:55:30,534 --> 00:55:31,867


1010
00:55:31,867 --> 00:55:36,567
I appreciate you sending
me such a precious gift,

1011
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:38,001


1012
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,666
I don't know how to thank you.

1013
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:46,833
It was sent from Madam Shin,

1014
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:48,833
your grandmother-in-law.

1015
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:49,733
What?

1016
00:55:49,733 --> 00:55:50,666


1017
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:52,567
My grandmother-in-law?

1018
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:55,467
Yes, the King's grandmother.

1019
00:55:55,467 --> 00:55:57,634


1020
00:55:57,634 --> 00:56:00,001
Her life story

1021
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:03,666
is longer than a novel.

1022
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:04,867


1023
00:56:04,867 --> 00:56:07,500
Let's eat first,

1024
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,266


1025
00:56:08,266 --> 00:56:10,467
and talk about it later.

1026
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:11,001


1027
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:12,701
Lady Hyun-sook

1028
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:16,467
Tell me about Madam Shin first.

1029
00:56:16,467 --> 00:56:19,733
Is she still alive?

1030
00:56:19,733 --> 00:56:21,434


1031
00:56:21,434 --> 00:56:23,701
Yes, she's still alive.

1032
00:56:23,701 --> 00:56:28,833
I think I saw her when
I was a young kisaeng.

1033
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:32,567
I think you've heard
of the deposed Queen.

1034
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:33,434


1035
00:56:33,434 --> 00:56:38,634
After her deposal,
Madam Shin had nobody to rely on.

1036
00:56:38,634 --> 00:56:41,800


1037
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:46,001
Her home was taken away,
so she wandered as a beggar.

1038
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:46,701


1039
00:56:46,701 --> 00:56:51,199
She finally came to me
in desperation

1040
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,534
and asked me
to take her in as a maid.

1041
00:56:55,534 --> 00:56:57,434


1042
00:56:57,434 --> 00:57:00,599
But how could I?

1043
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:01,733


1044
00:57:01,733 --> 00:57:06,333
How could the King's
grandmother be my maid?

1045
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:07,567


1046
00:57:07,567 --> 00:57:09,467
So I asked my father

1047
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,199


1048
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:15,367
and he was shocked by this news.

1049
00:57:15,367 --> 00:57:17,833
He said he was jobless

1050
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:19,001
but he added

1051
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:20,467


1052
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:26,233
he couldn't leave her out.
to die of starvation.

1053
00:57:26,233 --> 00:57:27,666


1054
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:32,001
So he gave her food
and shelter to help her.

1055
00:57:32,001 --> 00:57:32,900


1056
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,333
Poor woman.

1057
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:35,833


1058
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:39,367
If the King knew this,

1059
00:57:39,367 --> 00:57:41,666
he would be miserable.

1060
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,800


1061
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,266
He thinks day and night
about his mother.

1062
00:57:46,266 --> 00:57:49,434


1063
00:57:49,434 --> 00:57:53,833
Considering her difficult life,

1064
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:58,900
why did she give me
such a precious jewel?

1065
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,467


1066
00:58:00,467 --> 00:58:04,434
It bears an astonishing story.

1067
00:58:04,434 --> 00:58:05,500


1068
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,567
When Queen Yoon
was in the palace,

1069
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:12,567
King Sung-jong gave it to her.

1070
00:58:12,567 --> 00:58:13,266


1071
00:58:13,266 --> 00:58:18,300
She always told her mother,
Madam Shin

1072
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,634
that she must pass the jewel

1073
00:58:21,634 --> 00:58:23,833
on to her daughter-in-law,

1074
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:24,599


1075
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:27,367
sighing for this day to come.

1076
00:58:27,367 --> 00:58:28,967


1077
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:33,500
Madam Shin couldn't meet
the present Queen,

1078
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,001


1079
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:38,800
so when she heard
you became a concubine,

1080
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,701
she thought
you were worthy of it, too.

1081
00:58:42,701 --> 00:58:46,300
That's why she sent it to you.

1082
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,434


1083
00:58:47,434 --> 00:58:48,666
I see.

1084
00:58:48,666 --> 00:58:50,233


1085
00:58:50,233 --> 00:58:55,434
By any chance
is Madam Shin here today?

1086
00:58:55,434 --> 00:58:57,434
Yes, she is.

1087
00:58:57,434 --> 00:58:58,599
Really?

1088
00:58:58,599 --> 00:58:59,800


1089
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,266
Then I'd like to meet her.

1090
00:59:02,266 --> 00:59:05,467


1091
00:59:05,467 --> 00:59:07,701
Concubine Jang is here.

1092
00:59:07,701 --> 00:59:09,199


1093
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:10,001
Please, greet her.

1094
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:14,634


1095
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,134
It's an honor.

1096
00:59:16,134 --> 00:59:17,900


1097
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,233
No, it's my honor.

1098
00:59:20,233 --> 00:59:30,934


1099
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:34,666
How are the King and Queen?

1100
00:59:34,666 --> 00:59:35,766
Fine.

1101
00:59:35,766 --> 00:59:38,134


1102
00:59:38,134 --> 00:59:40,800
I've waited so long.

1103
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,201


1104
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:46,699
I've always dreamed
of this day to meet you.

1105
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:47,833


1106
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:52,067
I'm honored to receive
your precious gift.

1107
00:59:52,067 --> 00:59:52,733


1108
00:59:52,733 --> 00:59:56,632
I don't know how to thank you.

1109
00:59:56,632 --> 00:59:57,500


1110
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,900
Please, don't.

1111
00:59:58,900 --> 00:59:59,500


1112
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,266
It's not me who gave it to you.

1113
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:06,867
It's from my daughter,
the deposed Queen.

1114
01:00:06,867 --> 01:00:10,500


1115
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,900
Now, I have no other wishes,

1116
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,500


1117
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,967
except for one.

1118
01:00:15,967 --> 01:00:19,766
My grandson, who I saw as a child,

1119
01:00:19,766 --> 01:00:24,067
is now a great King.

1120
01:00:24,067 --> 01:00:28,632
To see him wear his crown...

1121
01:00:28,632 --> 01:00:29,201


1122
01:00:29,201 --> 01:00:32,001
To see him just once,

1123
01:00:32,001 --> 01:00:32,967


1124
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:37,201
is my last wish before I die.

1125
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:40,599


1126
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:43,166
My daughter was unjustly killed.

1127
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:45,300
My poor daughter.

1128
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:45,833


1129
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:47,699
My lady,

1130
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:51,166
please help me release this grief.

1131
01:00:51,166 --> 01:01:14,599


1132
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:17,567
What's wrong, uncle?
Are you missing Nok-soo?

1133
01:01:17,567 --> 01:01:20,867


1134
01:01:20,867 --> 01:01:22,500
What are you doing?

1135
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,500
Fill his glass!

1136
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:29,934


1137
01:01:29,934 --> 01:01:31,699
Worthless.

1138
01:01:31,699 --> 01:01:33,001
Shameful.

1139
01:01:33,001 --> 01:01:35,766


1140
01:01:35,766 --> 01:01:38,632
A day doesn't pass
without a party

1141
01:01:38,632 --> 01:01:39,934


1142
01:01:39,934 --> 01:01:44,900
and he even gets drunk
with whores from the street.

1143
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,500


1144
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,632
Who will manage
of the affairs of this state?

1145
01:01:50,632 --> 01:01:52,934


1146
01:01:52,934 --> 01:01:53,934
Furthermore,

1147
01:01:53,934 --> 01:01:54,833


1148
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:59,733
the King indulges
with so many women lately

1149
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:00,733


1150
01:02:00,733 --> 01:02:04,001
this palace is becoming a harem.

1151
01:02:04,001 --> 01:02:07,733


1152
01:02:07,733 --> 01:02:13,900
If you don't stop
the King's misconduct,

1153
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:14,733


1154
01:02:14,733 --> 01:02:17,201
this country will collapse.

1155
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:17,639


1156
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:22,699
I will carry out your wish.

1157
01:02:22,699 --> 01:03:44,266


1158
01:03:44,266 --> 01:03:48,500
You're very charming.
What's your name?

1159
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,201
Sung Lim-chun, Majesty.

1160
01:03:51,201 --> 01:03:53,034
Come live in the palace.

1161
01:03:53,034 --> 01:03:55,001
A lowly person like me?

1162
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:56,134
Not so.

1163
01:03:56,134 --> 01:03:56,800


1164
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,599
Stay with us.

1165
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:03,567
I like common people like you,
who doesn't care for custom.

1166
01:04:03,567 --> 01:04:05,001
Right, uncle?

1167
01:04:05,001 --> 01:04:05,766


1168
01:04:05,766 --> 01:04:09,067
I'm the world's most pathetic King.

1169
01:04:09,067 --> 01:04:11,567
I have no rights.

1170
01:04:11,567 --> 01:04:13,400
My elders give me no rights,

1171
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,699
and the ministers
deprive me of power.

1172
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:19,500
All those dumb ministers

1173
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,900
don't care about
ruling over the people

1174
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,001
but bother me with custom.

1175
01:04:26,001 --> 01:04:29,632
Those corrupt scholars
who complain about me,

1176
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:34,201
criticize my clothes, my shoes,
what I eat and how I sleep.

1177
01:04:34,201 --> 01:04:35,532


1178
01:04:35,532 --> 01:04:40,300
Only when an obedient
and foolish man takes the throne

1179
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:40,833


1180
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:43,599
will they praise him as a great King.

1181
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:44,201


1182
01:04:44,201 --> 01:04:47,632
So how can a proud man
like me rule as King?

1183
01:04:47,632 --> 01:04:48,166


1184
01:04:48,166 --> 01:04:50,034
Don't you agree?

1185
01:04:50,034 --> 01:04:51,067
Am I wrong?

1186
01:04:51,067 --> 01:04:58,733


1187
01:04:58,733 --> 01:05:01,666
Don't worry about them.

1188
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:02,500


1189
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,900
Just laugh it away.

1190
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:05,699


1191
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:09,134
Then the world may look different.

1192
01:05:09,134 --> 01:05:10,900
So let's laugh!

1193
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:38,567


1194
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,067
Your Majesty.

1195
01:05:40,067 --> 01:05:40,567


1196
01:05:40,567 --> 01:05:42,101
What's wrong?

1197
01:05:42,101 --> 01:05:43,067


1198
01:05:43,067 --> 01:05:46,630
Did I make some mistake?

1199
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:51,967


1200
01:05:51,967 --> 01:05:53,166
Nok-soo.

1201
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:53,699


1202
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:54,833
Come here.

1203
01:05:54,833 --> 01:05:59,001
Know how lonely uncle was
because you were gone?

1204
01:05:59,001 --> 01:06:00,666
Go fill his cup.

1205
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:01,201


1206
01:06:01,201 --> 01:06:02,166
Majesty.

1207
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:03,067


1208
01:06:03,067 --> 01:06:04,833
She's yours not mine.

1209
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:09,666


1210
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:10,934
Majesty.

1211
01:06:10,934 --> 01:06:11,699


1212
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:15,833
This isn't the time
to be free of worries.

1213
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:17,201
But it's fun.

1214
01:06:17,201 --> 01:06:17,833


1215
01:06:17,833 --> 01:06:19,501
Majesty.

1216
01:06:19,501 --> 01:06:22,067
I have something urgent to say.

1217
01:06:22,067 --> 01:06:24,467
Please be done with this party.

1218
01:06:24,467 --> 01:06:26,699
Did someone insult me again?

1219
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:28,166
Fine.

1220
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:31,934
If somebody insulted me,
I will tear his mouth apart!

1221
01:06:31,934 --> 01:06:32,967
Who is it?

1222
01:06:32,967 --> 01:06:54,067


1223
01:06:54,067 --> 01:06:56,467
I will speak, Your Majesty.

1224
01:06:56,467 --> 01:06:57,300


1225
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,300
The country is in despair recently.

1226
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:00,967


1227
01:07:00,967 --> 01:07:03,467
Your Majesty has spent so much

1228
01:07:03,467 --> 01:07:06,501
the treasury is almost empty.

1229
01:07:06,501 --> 01:07:07,067


1230
01:07:07,067 --> 01:07:10,233
This has never happened before.

1231
01:07:10,233 --> 01:07:14,867
so please reconsider
for this country and the people.

1232
01:07:14,867 --> 01:07:16,067
And?

1233
01:07:16,067 --> 01:07:18,800
I will speak, Your Majesty.

1234
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,833
Please reduce the banquets,
and consider a humble life.

1235
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:27,434
This is the way
for a King to rule his people.

1236
01:07:27,434 --> 01:07:28,900
And you?

1237
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,400
I will speak, Your Majesty.

1238
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:36,000


1239
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,367
This is the list of expenses
for all your banquets,

1240
01:07:41,367 --> 01:07:44,000
after inspecting the treasury.

1241
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,099
- 3170 bags of rice
and other crops.

1242
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:49,300
- 19 gallons of honey.

1243
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,867
- 24 gallons of oil.

1244
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:54,199
- 6263 rolls of cotton.

1245
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:57,266
- 562 white candles.

1246
01:07:57,266 --> 01:08:00,099
- 370 yellow candles.

1247
01:08:00,099 --> 01:08:05,067
In addition to this, blue silk,
light blue silk, dark blue silk,

1248
01:08:05,067 --> 01:08:08,233
tiger silk, duck silk, lamb silk.

1249
01:08:08,233 --> 01:08:12,867


1250
01:08:12,867 --> 01:08:15,800
As well as red silk,

1251
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,966
white silk, yellow silk.

1252
01:08:18,966 --> 01:08:20,367
Go away!

1253
01:08:20,367 --> 01:08:23,000


1254
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,600
I'm flattered.

1255
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,533


1256
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:30,832
Go tell this to Queen Mother
I'm still sober enough

1257
01:08:30,832 --> 01:08:33,067
to rule this country!

1258
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:36,199


1259
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:38,199
Why are you all still there?

1260
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:42,466


1261
01:08:42,466 --> 01:08:43,434
Ja-won.

1262
01:08:43,434 --> 01:08:46,501


1263
01:08:46,501 --> 01:08:49,400
Prepare a banquet
in Sang-lim garden,

1264
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:54,266
and tell the royal cooks
to prepare a big feast.

1265
01:08:54,266 --> 01:08:54,899


1266
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:56,501
Go to the kisaengs.

1267
01:08:56,501 --> 01:08:57,367
No!

1268
01:08:57,367 --> 01:08:58,301


1269
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:02,600
Go to the streets,
and bring every whore there is!

1270
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,867
Yes, my lord.

1271
01:09:03,867 --> 01:09:13,167


1272
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:15,400
I'm the loneliest man there is.

1273
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:27,033


1274
01:09:27,033 --> 01:09:28,199
I'm glad you came.

1275
01:09:28,199 --> 01:09:29,033


1276
01:09:29,033 --> 01:09:34,199
I was about to call you
to hear about my aunt's birthday.

1277
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:35,567


1278
01:09:35,567 --> 01:09:37,100
What's that?

1279
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,367
Majesty,

1280
01:09:38,367 --> 01:09:39,301


1281
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:41,367
please look at this.

1282
01:09:41,367 --> 01:09:44,800


1283
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:48,134
It's a very valuable item.

1284
01:09:48,134 --> 01:09:49,234
What is it?

1285
01:09:49,234 --> 01:09:50,600
Wait.

1286
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,434


1287
01:09:51,434 --> 01:09:53,567
You should dress formally

1288
01:09:53,567 --> 01:09:54,400


1289
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,167
and undo the package
with your own hands.

1290
01:09:58,167 --> 01:09:59,533
What on earth is it?

1291
01:09:59,533 --> 01:10:01,501
Forgive me for this

1292
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:06,301
but Your Majesty shouldn't
spend your time too freely.

1293
01:10:06,301 --> 01:10:07,234


1294
01:10:07,234 --> 01:10:12,533
It contains the last Queen's
poor and miserable spirit.

1295
01:10:12,533 --> 01:10:13,500
What?

1296
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:13,932


1297
01:10:13,932 --> 01:10:15,832
The last Queen?

1298
01:10:15,832 --> 01:10:17,400


1299
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,367
- So it's my mother's?
- Yes.

1300
01:10:19,367 --> 01:10:40,167


1301
01:10:40,167 --> 01:10:41,466
What is this?

1302
01:10:41,466 --> 01:10:42,466


1303
01:10:42,466 --> 01:10:44,333
What is this dirty thing?

1304
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:45,000


1305
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,367
Are you mocking me?

1306
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:46,932


1307
01:10:46,932 --> 01:10:48,434
No, Your Majesty.

1308
01:10:48,434 --> 01:10:50,399


1309
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:54,367
How dare I mock you?

1310
01:10:54,367 --> 01:10:57,500


1311
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,567
It's her blood and tears,

1312
01:11:00,567 --> 01:11:02,801
at the time of her death,

1313
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:03,466


1314
01:11:03,466 --> 01:11:07,266
when she was poisoned.

1315
01:11:07,266 --> 01:11:08,533


1316
01:11:08,533 --> 01:11:11,332
She wiped her blood and tears

1317
01:11:11,332 --> 01:11:14,199
with this cloth and said:

1318
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:16,266


1319
01:11:16,266 --> 01:11:19,567
"Mother, I'm leaving now.

1320
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:21,533


1321
01:11:21,533 --> 01:11:23,833
When my son grows up,

1322
01:11:23,833 --> 01:11:26,801
please give him this cloth,

1323
01:11:26,801 --> 01:11:28,199


1324
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:31,399
and tell him about
my unjust death."

1325
01:11:31,399 --> 01:11:33,701
Then she passed away.

1326
01:11:33,701 --> 01:11:36,634


1327
01:11:36,634 --> 01:11:37,667
Majesty,

1328
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:38,900


1329
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:41,667
now is not the time to drink.

1330
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:42,399


1331
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:44,500
Gather yourself,

1332
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:48,600
and free her spirits
from this misery.

1333
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,466


1334
01:11:49,466 --> 01:11:50,466
This...

1335
01:11:50,466 --> 01:11:52,567


1336
01:11:52,567 --> 01:11:56,567
This is really my mother's blood?

1337
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:57,567
Yes.

1338
01:11:57,567 --> 01:12:01,333


1339
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:03,300
Where did you get this?

1340
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,634


1341
01:12:05,634 --> 01:12:09,833
I met your grandmother

1342
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:12,500
at Lady Hyun-sook's
birthday banquet.

1343
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,199
So she's still alive?

1344
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:15,667
Yes.

1345
01:12:15,667 --> 01:12:19,233
She's waiting for you
in the Ok-hwa room.

1346
01:12:19,233 --> 01:12:21,001
- The Ok-hwa room?
- Yes.

1347
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:22,033
Let's go.

1348
01:12:22,033 --> 01:12:26,734


1349
01:12:26,734 --> 01:12:28,833
Is she my grandmother?

1350
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:30,900
Yes, she is.

1351
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,567


1352
01:12:32,567 --> 01:12:33,867
Grandmother.

1353
01:12:33,867 --> 01:12:44,567


1354
01:12:44,567 --> 01:12:46,332
Majesty.

1355
01:12:46,332 --> 01:12:50,199


1356
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:54,233
You're the old woman I met

1357
01:12:54,233 --> 01:12:55,399


1358
01:12:55,399 --> 01:12:57,533
on my way back from hunting?

1359
01:12:57,533 --> 01:12:58,766


1360
01:12:58,766 --> 01:13:00,701
Yes, Your Majesty.

1361
01:13:00,701 --> 01:13:02,233
This can't be!

1362
01:13:02,233 --> 01:13:03,734


1363
01:13:03,734 --> 01:13:08,466
I treated my grandmother
like a dog.

1364
01:13:08,466 --> 01:13:10,266


1365
01:13:10,266 --> 01:13:11,466
Grandmother.

1366
01:13:11,466 --> 01:13:12,332


1367
01:13:12,332 --> 01:13:13,367
Grandmother.

1368
01:13:13,367 --> 01:13:18,500


1369
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,701
Majesty.

1370
01:13:19,701 --> 01:13:20,600


1371
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:24,966
Please stop crying,
and bring her into the palace.

1372
01:13:24,966 --> 01:13:26,634


1373
01:13:26,634 --> 01:13:28,301
Please, stand up.

1374
01:13:28,301 --> 01:13:31,201
Grandmother, please go inside.

1375
01:13:31,201 --> 01:13:33,001
I want to hear about my mother.

1376
01:13:33,001 --> 01:13:34,567


1377
01:13:34,567 --> 01:13:35,634
Please.

1378
01:13:35,634 --> 01:13:38,300


1379
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,734
Please, tell me.

1380
01:13:39,734 --> 01:13:42,300


1381
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:45,634
Is this really my mother's blood?

1382
01:13:45,634 --> 01:13:48,634


1383
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:49,600
Yes.

1384
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,533


1385
01:13:50,533 --> 01:13:52,399
It's her blood.

1386
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:53,934


1387
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:55,167
Please, tell me.

1388
01:13:55,167 --> 01:13:55,934


1389
01:13:55,934 --> 01:13:59,434
Tell me everything about her death.

1390
01:13:59,434 --> 01:14:01,266


1391
01:14:01,266 --> 01:14:04,300
Ever since your mother
was a concubine,

1392
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:05,600


1393
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,966
the last King loved her so much.

1394
01:14:08,966 --> 01:14:10,567


1395
01:14:10,567 --> 01:14:14,233
Three years after
his first wife died,

1396
01:14:14,233 --> 01:14:15,833


1397
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:19,701
your mother gave birth to you.

1398
01:14:19,701 --> 01:14:21,300


1399
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,266
That year,

1400
01:14:23,266 --> 01:14:23,801


1401
01:14:23,801 --> 01:14:27,434
your father made your mother Queen,

1402
01:14:27,434 --> 01:14:28,734


1403
01:14:28,734 --> 01:14:31,934
and declared you

1404
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:32,600


1405
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:35,033
to be his successor.

1406
01:14:35,033 --> 01:14:36,001
Please, go on.

1407
01:14:36,001 --> 01:14:40,634


1408
01:14:40,634 --> 01:14:42,100
It's beautiful!

1409
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:43,201


1410
01:14:43,201 --> 01:14:47,900
I can wear a cloth made
by your lovely hands.

1411
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:48,867


1412
01:14:48,867 --> 01:14:50,667
How can I thank you?

1413
01:14:50,667 --> 01:14:51,567


1414
01:14:51,567 --> 01:14:53,634
If people knew about this

1415
01:14:53,634 --> 01:14:56,600
they would weave harder
to be like you.

1416
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:00,934
It's my duty as a woman, Majesty.

1417
01:15:00,934 --> 01:15:03,800
Let me measure your size.

1418
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,667
All right.

1419
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:10,033


1420
01:15:10,033 --> 01:15:12,900
You're so tall, Your Majesty.

1421
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:13,432


1422
01:15:13,432 --> 01:15:15,867
So how much cloth is needed?

1423
01:15:15,867 --> 01:15:16,734


1424
01:15:16,734 --> 01:15:18,867
Over half a role just for your back.

1425
01:15:18,867 --> 01:15:20,966
I should've been shorter.

1426
01:15:20,966 --> 01:15:23,466
It would be less work for you.

1427
01:15:23,466 --> 01:15:24,201


1428
01:15:24,201 --> 01:15:26,634
- Majesty.
- My darling.

1429
01:15:26,634 --> 01:15:31,934


1430
01:15:31,934 --> 01:15:35,432
Please, don't do this.
The court lady is watching.

1431
01:15:35,432 --> 01:15:38,500
Why are you so shy, my bride?

1432
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,734


1433
01:15:40,734 --> 01:15:41,734
Majesty.

1434
01:15:41,734 --> 01:15:45,734
But there were people

1435
01:15:45,734 --> 01:15:48,167
jealous of their happiness.

1436
01:15:48,167 --> 01:15:51,067
Feeling neglected by the King

1437
01:15:51,067 --> 01:15:54,500
they were concubines
Jung and Uhm.

1438
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:59,134
And the other was the
King's mother, Queen In-su.

1439
01:15:59,134 --> 01:15:59,867


1440
01:15:59,867 --> 01:16:02,766
She was a widow

1441
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:05,934
so she adored the King very much

1442
01:16:05,934 --> 01:16:09,934
and hated your mother
for taking him away.

1443
01:16:09,934 --> 01:16:11,432


1444
01:16:11,432 --> 01:16:12,667
In autumn, your mother

1445
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:13,466


1446
01:16:13,466 --> 01:16:18,600
held a silkworm festival

1447
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,001
and ordered
all the palace women to come.

1448
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:27,667
But concubines
Jung and Um didn't appear.

1449
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:29,001


1450
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:32,033
You didn't go because
you were with Queen Mother?

1451
01:16:32,033 --> 01:16:35,466
You disgraceful fools.
Aren't you scared of death?

1452
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:40,934
But how dare we object
Queen Mother's calling?

1453
01:16:40,934 --> 01:16:44,201
Didn't she know
about the festival?

1454
01:16:44,201 --> 01:16:46,033
Nonsense.

1455
01:16:46,033 --> 01:16:48,001
Beat those disgraceful women.

1456
01:16:48,001 --> 01:16:55,966


1457
01:16:55,966 --> 01:16:58,667
Queen Mother has arrived.

1458
01:16:58,667 --> 01:16:59,734
Queen Mother.

1459
01:16:59,734 --> 01:17:00,699
Queen Mother.

1460
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:02,466


1461
01:17:02,466 --> 01:17:05,900
How in the world
could you do this?

1462
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:11,533


1463
01:17:11,533 --> 01:17:15,699
They couldn't go
because I called them

1464
01:17:15,699 --> 01:17:16,567


1465
01:17:16,567 --> 01:17:19,900
to care for the pain in my legs.

1466
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,399


1467
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:26,067
I'm to blame so let them free.

1468
01:17:26,067 --> 01:17:27,432
Forgive me,

1469
01:17:27,432 --> 01:17:28,634


1470
01:17:28,634 --> 01:17:31,201
but it's to teach royal etiquette.

1471
01:17:31,201 --> 01:17:33,167
There are no other intentions.

1472
01:17:33,167 --> 01:17:34,600


1473
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,067
If that is your command,

1474
01:17:37,067 --> 01:17:38,067


1475
01:17:38,067 --> 01:17:40,734
I will send them back tomorrow.

1476
01:17:40,734 --> 01:17:42,734
So please don't worry.

1477
01:17:42,734 --> 01:17:53,001


1478
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:55,533
After this incident,

1479
01:17:55,533 --> 01:17:57,766
concubines Jung and Uhm

1480
01:17:57,766 --> 01:18:00,567
went to a fortune teller's home

1481
01:18:00,567 --> 01:18:04,100
in Nam Mountain every day.

1482
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:04,690


1483
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:07,167
They even sold their property,

1484
01:18:07,167 --> 01:18:10,833
to find some way to get rid of you

1485
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:13,367
and your mother.

1486
01:18:13,367 --> 01:18:17,500


1487
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,100
Take this, please.

1488
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:25,634


1489
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:27,567
We hope it'll do.

1490
01:18:27,567 --> 01:18:28,201


1491
01:18:28,201 --> 01:18:29,966
It's so much.

1492
01:18:29,966 --> 01:18:32,266
So is it going well?

1493
01:18:32,266 --> 01:18:34,567
It's not an easy matter.

1494
01:18:34,567 --> 01:18:35,867


1495
01:18:35,867 --> 01:18:38,100
If people learn about this,

1496
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:42,634
they would cut my neck, and yours.

1497
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:44,699
So never let this out.

1498
01:18:44,699 --> 01:18:46,399
Please don't worry.

1499
01:18:46,399 --> 01:19:01,500


1500
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,533
A few days later,

1501
01:19:03,533 --> 01:19:08,100
you suddenly got very sick.

1502
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:12,067
The palace was in turmoil.

1503
01:19:12,067 --> 01:19:20,800


1504
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,067
Mother,

1505
01:19:22,067 --> 01:19:23,001


1506
01:19:23,001 --> 01:19:24,833
what should I do?

1507
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:25,500


1508
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,533
Medicine may be helpful

1509
01:19:28,533 --> 01:19:31,600
but his illness seems too severe.

1510
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:36,567
So we should pray to the gods
in a great temple or mountains

1511
01:19:36,567 --> 01:19:39,067
or find a famous fortune teller

1512
01:19:39,067 --> 01:19:42,432
to heal the little prince?

1513
01:19:42,432 --> 01:19:47,033
I think his illness
is caused by an evil spirit.

1514
01:19:47,033 --> 01:19:47,766


1515
01:19:47,766 --> 01:19:52,201
You're right.
Do you know of any fortune tellers?

1516
01:19:52,201 --> 01:19:55,966
There's one
who lives in Nam Mountain.

1517
01:19:55,966 --> 01:19:58,466
He's very good
at curing illnesses.

1518
01:19:58,466 --> 01:20:01,934
Then let's hurry.
We have no time.

1519
01:20:01,934 --> 01:20:16,634


1520
01:20:16,634 --> 01:20:18,500
How could this be.

1521
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:19,234


1522
01:20:19,234 --> 01:20:21,201
It's a terrible misfortune.

1523
01:20:21,201 --> 01:20:22,134


1524
01:20:22,134 --> 01:20:22,966
What is it?

1525
01:20:22,966 --> 01:20:24,000


1526
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,667
I can't do this.

1527
01:20:25,667 --> 01:20:26,734


1528
01:20:26,734 --> 01:20:29,867
Why can't you. Tell me what's wrong.

1529
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:30,867


1530
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:32,634
If money is short...

1531
01:20:32,634 --> 01:20:33,734


1532
01:20:33,734 --> 01:20:35,399
Here's more.

1533
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:39,766


1534
01:20:39,766 --> 01:20:42,001
I shouldn't be doing this.

1535
01:20:42,001 --> 01:20:43,867


1536
01:20:43,867 --> 01:20:48,333
You must guarantee my life.

1537
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:51,733
Don't worry.
If your magic works,

1538
01:20:51,733 --> 01:20:55,067
I will ask the Queen
to reward you handsomely.

1539
01:20:55,067 --> 01:20:56,600


1540
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:57,766
Alright, then.

1541
01:20:57,766 --> 01:20:59,600


1542
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,100
The prince seems to be very sick.

1543
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:03,833


1544
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:04,766
Am I right?

1545
01:21:04,766 --> 01:21:05,500


1546
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,833
You are. Please, go on.

1547
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:08,699


1548
01:21:08,699 --> 01:21:13,800
How could an evil spirit
enter the palace?

1549
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,234
It's strange.

1550
01:21:15,234 --> 01:21:16,934
Strange?

1551
01:21:16,934 --> 01:21:18,234


1552
01:21:18,234 --> 01:21:22,033
His illness didn't come
by natural means,

1553
01:21:22,033 --> 01:21:25,367
but from someone's evil magic.

1554
01:21:25,367 --> 01:21:28,733
Someone's evil magic? Whose?

1555
01:21:28,733 --> 01:21:35,234


1556
01:21:35,234 --> 01:21:37,934
My life could be in danger

1557
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:38,600


1558
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,766
but I already started,
so I can't stop.

1559
01:21:41,766 --> 01:21:45,000


1560
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,800
Can you really guarantee my life?

1561
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,301
I told you not to worry.

1562
01:21:52,301 --> 01:21:57,367


1563
01:21:57,367 --> 01:22:00,301
Women whose family name

1564
01:22:00,301 --> 01:22:01,167


1565
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:03,934
is a four-legged animal

1566
01:22:03,934 --> 01:22:04,667


1567
01:22:04,667 --> 01:22:10,167
controls his illness with a spell.

1568
01:22:10,167 --> 01:22:12,067
If you let this go on,

1569
01:22:12,067 --> 01:22:13,100


1570
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,234
the prince could die.

1571
01:22:14,234 --> 01:22:15,800


1572
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,766
So what should we do?

1573
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:18,533


1574
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:21,699
Go to the palace quickly

1575
01:22:21,699 --> 01:22:22,400


1576
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,899
and walk three steps westward
from the prince's chimney.

1577
01:22:26,899 --> 01:22:30,033
If you dig there,
you'll find an object.

1578
01:22:30,033 --> 01:22:31,367
My goodness!

1579
01:22:31,367 --> 01:22:34,899
Then take him out
of the palace somehow,

1580
01:22:34,899 --> 01:22:36,699
and put him in a safe place.

1581
01:22:36,699 --> 01:22:38,766


1582
01:22:38,766 --> 01:22:41,266
This could've been worse.

1583
01:22:41,266 --> 01:22:47,100
If you give me 50 bags of rice
and some fabric

1584
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:53,149
I'll pray for 100 days
and get rid of the evil spell.

1585
01:22:53,149 --> 01:23:03,221


1586
01:23:03,221 --> 01:23:05,501
2, 3...

1587
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:06,434
It's here.

1588
01:23:06,434 --> 01:23:13,867


1589
01:23:13,867 --> 01:23:14,966
It's here.

1590
01:23:14,966 --> 01:23:19,932


1591
01:23:19,932 --> 01:23:21,100
My goodness!

1592
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:38,506


1593
01:23:38,506 --> 01:23:40,523
My goodness!

1594
01:23:40,523 --> 01:23:43,932


1595
01:23:43,932 --> 01:23:45,466
My daughter,

1596
01:23:45,466 --> 01:23:48,932
how could this be possible?

1597
01:23:48,932 --> 01:23:52,567
That fortune teller was right, Madam.

1598
01:23:52,567 --> 01:23:53,567
Alright.

1599
01:23:53,567 --> 01:23:54,199


1600
01:23:54,199 --> 01:23:57,367
If her family name
is a four-legged animal,

1601
01:23:57,367 --> 01:23:58,167


1602
01:23:58,167 --> 01:24:00,832
who do you think she is?

1603
01:24:00,832 --> 01:24:02,266


1604
01:24:02,266 --> 01:24:03,501
I'm not sure.

1605
01:24:03,501 --> 01:24:04,533


1606
01:24:04,533 --> 01:24:08,600
I'm positive
one of the concubines did this.

1607
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,266


1608
01:24:09,266 --> 01:24:10,634
Madam,

1609
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:14,533
in a proverb,
Jung means a donkey.

1610
01:24:14,533 --> 01:24:15,434


1611
01:24:15,434 --> 01:24:18,899
You're right.
Concubine Jung did this.

1612
01:24:18,899 --> 01:24:20,367


1613
01:24:20,367 --> 01:24:21,867
Concubine Jung?

1614
01:24:21,867 --> 01:24:23,266
Yes.

1615
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:26,000
Queen Mother trusts her,

1616
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,134
and the King adores her.

1617
01:24:29,134 --> 01:24:31,367
Since she has a baby,

1618
01:24:31,367 --> 01:24:34,199
she's acting like a Queen.

1619
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:34,966


1620
01:24:34,966 --> 01:24:38,701
Because of that festival,

1621
01:24:38,701 --> 01:24:40,600
she's bearing a grudge,

1622
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:44,400
so she must've planned this.

1623
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:48,832
That wench
is trying to kill my son.

1624
01:24:48,832 --> 01:24:51,800
I'm so angry I can't speak.

1625
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,867
Calm down for now.

1626
01:24:53,867 --> 01:24:54,966


1627
01:24:54,966 --> 01:24:59,199
If you act rash,
it could ruin your honor.

1628
01:24:59,199 --> 01:24:59,899


1629
01:24:59,899 --> 01:25:04,266
We should wait
for a chance to spoil her later.

1630
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:05,234


1631
01:25:05,234 --> 01:25:08,000
The prince's illness
is more urgent.

1632
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,899
So let's move him

1633
01:25:09,899 --> 01:25:14,800
into a safe place after
we get the King's permission.

1634
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:19,067
Madam Shin made a good suggestion.

1635
01:25:19,067 --> 01:25:20,266
Alright.

1636
01:25:20,266 --> 01:25:21,333


1637
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:26,167
So we moved you safely

1638
01:25:26,167 --> 01:25:30,033
into Minister Kang's home.

1639
01:25:30,033 --> 01:25:31,701


1640
01:25:31,701 --> 01:25:35,266
My lady, I have two plans.

1641
01:25:35,266 --> 01:25:36,533
What are they?

1642
01:25:36,533 --> 01:25:37,734


1643
01:25:37,734 --> 01:25:42,533
The first plan
is to poison Concubine Jung.

1644
01:25:42,533 --> 01:25:44,067
What?

1645
01:25:44,067 --> 01:25:46,800
- Poison her?
- Yes.

1646
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,932


1647
01:25:47,932 --> 01:25:52,932
The second is to split up
Concubine Jung and the King

1648
01:25:52,932 --> 01:25:53,434


1649
01:25:53,434 --> 01:25:57,434
and ask the fortune teller
to cast a spell on her.

1650
01:25:57,434 --> 01:26:01,800
Just like they did to us,

1651
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,701
we should try to kill her, too.

1652
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:05,533


1653
01:26:05,533 --> 01:26:07,966
I think the second is better.

1654
01:26:07,966 --> 01:26:09,301


1655
01:26:09,301 --> 01:26:11,567
I thought so, my lady.

1656
01:26:11,567 --> 01:26:14,199


1657
01:26:14,199 --> 01:26:17,800
But if you split up the King

1658
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:18,400


1659
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,132
and Concubine Jung yourself,

1660
01:26:21,132 --> 01:26:24,067
it will disgrace
your dignity and honor.

1661
01:26:24,067 --> 01:26:28,699
So I think it's better
to find another way.

1662
01:26:28,699 --> 01:26:48,400


1663
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,333
Concubines Jung and Uhm
plotted to kill the prince?

1664
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:54,333


1665
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:57,600
My goodness.

1666
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,067
How could this be possible?

1667
01:27:01,067 --> 01:27:01,832


1668
01:27:01,832 --> 01:27:03,966
Within the royal palace.

1669
01:27:03,966 --> 01:27:07,067


1670
01:27:07,067 --> 01:27:08,766
Since the Queen is too,

1671
01:27:08,766 --> 01:27:09,766


1672
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:14,167
arrogant, rude, and jealous,

1673
01:27:14,167 --> 01:27:16,899
I predicted this to happen.

1674
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:19,567
I don't think
the Queen sent this.

1675
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:22,067
- I found it outside my door.
- It's definitely her.

1676
01:27:22,067 --> 01:27:23,333


1677
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:26,533
I'm not sure what you think,

1678
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:28,033
but I think this letter
means the opposite.

1679
01:27:28,033 --> 01:27:32,567
Concubines Jung and Uhm

1680
01:27:32,567 --> 01:27:36,000
are not trying to kill the prince,

1681
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:36,867


1682
01:27:36,867 --> 01:27:41,734
but the Queen is trying
to kill them, instead.

1683
01:27:41,734 --> 01:27:43,833
I'm sure of it.

1684
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:45,801
Concubines Jung and Uhm

1685
01:27:45,801 --> 01:27:51,300
would never do such a thing.

1686
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:56,199
It's my fault
for letting this happen.

1687
01:27:56,199 --> 01:27:56,801


1688
01:27:56,801 --> 01:27:59,533
Forgive me.

1689
01:27:59,533 --> 01:28:04,966
Lately, you are too generous
to the Queen.

1690
01:28:04,966 --> 01:28:07,199
I can't stand her arrogance.

1691
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:08,300


1692
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:10,167
How will you deal with this?

1693
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:12,266


1694
01:28:12,266 --> 01:28:13,701
I'll take care of it.

1695
01:28:13,701 --> 01:28:31,000


1696
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,867
If you read
this spell book for 100 days

1697
01:28:35,867 --> 01:28:40,567
he said Concubine Jung
and her son will never survive.

1698
01:28:40,567 --> 01:28:45,300


1699
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:46,766
This is poison.

1700
01:28:46,766 --> 01:28:47,533


1701
01:28:47,533 --> 01:28:49,667
If they eat a little, they'll die.

1702
01:28:49,667 --> 01:28:50,801


1703
01:28:50,801 --> 01:28:52,801
The King has arrived.

1704
01:28:52,801 --> 01:28:53,701
Oh, goodness!

1705
01:28:53,701 --> 01:28:54,567


1706
01:28:54,567 --> 01:28:55,533
Put it away!

1707
01:28:55,533 --> 01:28:57,100
Hurry.

1708
01:28:57,100 --> 01:29:07,801


1709
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:10,434
Coming from
Queen Mother's quarters?

1710
01:29:10,434 --> 01:29:12,500
I see your mother is here.

1711
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,266
Yes, she is.

1712
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:28,167


1713
01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:29,867
Why are you standing there?

1714
01:29:29,867 --> 01:29:31,833
Come here and sit down.

1715
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:32,399


1716
01:29:32,399 --> 01:29:33,367
Yes.

1717
01:29:33,367 --> 01:29:34,167


1718
01:29:34,167 --> 01:29:38,266
What's wrong?
I told you to come here.

1719
01:29:38,266 --> 01:29:39,167


1720
01:29:39,167 --> 01:29:42,333
I need to talk to you.

1721
01:29:42,333 --> 01:29:44,701
No, my foot is asleep.

1722
01:29:44,701 --> 01:29:46,634


1723
01:29:46,634 --> 01:29:47,766
My goodness!

1724
01:29:47,766 --> 01:29:49,466


1725
01:29:49,466 --> 01:29:50,667
What's that?

1726
01:29:50,667 --> 01:29:54,766
It's nothing.
Nothing but women's stuff.

1727
01:29:54,766 --> 01:29:55,801
Give it to me.

1728
01:29:55,801 --> 01:29:59,801


1729
01:29:59,801 --> 01:30:02,701
This?

1730
01:30:02,701 --> 01:30:08,399


1731
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:11,266
It's poison, isn't it?

1732
01:30:11,266 --> 01:30:12,132


1733
01:30:12,132 --> 01:30:13,367
Say something.

1734
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:15,399


1735
01:30:15,399 --> 01:30:18,766
You must've sent this letter.

1736
01:30:18,766 --> 01:30:20,833
I never thought you'd do this.

1737
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:22,801
You vicious woman.

1738
01:30:22,801 --> 01:30:43,701


1739
01:30:43,701 --> 01:30:45,501
Tell me the truth.

1740
01:30:45,501 --> 01:30:46,434


1741
01:30:46,434 --> 01:30:47,867
Majesty.

1742
01:30:47,867 --> 01:30:48,567


1743
01:30:48,567 --> 01:30:53,500
How dare I lie to you
in the name of the gods?

1744
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,734
The poison was mine,

1745
01:30:55,734 --> 01:30:58,100
and I thought the spell book

1746
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:02,600
could help heal the prince.

1747
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:03,434


1748
01:31:03,434 --> 01:31:06,701
So I gave it to the Queen.

1749
01:31:06,701 --> 01:31:10,333
But why did you own poison,

1750
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:12,333
and then hand it to the Queen?

1751
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:14,266


1752
01:31:14,266 --> 01:31:16,766
I've suffered a fever every year

1753
01:31:16,766 --> 01:31:17,399


1754
01:31:17,399 --> 01:31:19,634
so I had to keep it.

1755
01:31:19,634 --> 01:31:21,167


1756
01:31:21,167 --> 01:31:25,333
The Queen was worried
about my illness,

1757
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:28,819
and she wanted a little,
so I gave it to her.

1758
01:31:28,819 --> 01:31:29,399


1759
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:32,500
Keep beating her,
until she tells the truth.

1760
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,766


1761
01:31:34,766 --> 01:31:37,233
Queen Mother has arrived.

1762
01:31:37,233 --> 01:31:43,867


1763
01:31:43,867 --> 01:31:45,766
She's a wicked girl!

1764
01:31:45,766 --> 01:31:47,900


1765
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:52,934
The Queen must've conspired
with her mother and her maid.

1766
01:31:52,934 --> 01:31:56,500
But we don't have any clear evidence.

1767
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:58,833
What are you talking about?

1768
01:31:58,833 --> 01:32:00,132


1769
01:32:00,132 --> 01:32:02,701
Kill that wicked maid tomorrow,

1770
01:32:02,701 --> 01:32:03,766


1771
01:32:03,766 --> 01:32:07,533
and forbid Madam Shin
to visit her daughter.

1772
01:32:07,533 --> 01:32:08,434
And the Queen...

1773
01:32:08,434 --> 01:32:10,567


1774
01:32:10,567 --> 01:32:14,300
After conferring with the ministers,

1775
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:16,100
depose the Queen.

1776
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:28,466


1777
01:32:28,466 --> 01:32:33,199
Lord Lim, you know the King
won't rule forever.

1778
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:33,966


1779
01:32:33,966 --> 01:32:37,266
Once the King passes away,

1780
01:32:37,266 --> 01:32:39,867
my grandson will take his place.

1781
01:32:39,867 --> 01:32:40,399


1782
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:44,001
So please ask the King

1783
01:32:44,001 --> 01:32:46,766
not to depose the Queen.

1784
01:32:46,766 --> 01:32:47,300


1785
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:51,132
Then I will never forget
your kindness.

1786
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:52,667


1787
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:54,934
I understand, Madam.

1788
01:32:54,934 --> 01:32:55,701


1789
01:32:55,701 --> 01:32:57,600
I trust you with this.

1790
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:05,167


1791
01:33:05,167 --> 01:33:08,233
Today, I want to discuss
the Queen deposal.

1792
01:33:08,233 --> 01:33:09,833
It's a serious matter.

1793
01:33:09,833 --> 01:33:10,367


1794
01:33:10,367 --> 01:33:15,233
I want to hear your opinions,
and expect honest answers.

1795
01:33:15,233 --> 01:33:19,867


1796
01:33:19,867 --> 01:33:21,567
Majesty,

1797
01:33:21,567 --> 01:33:26,734


1798
01:33:26,734 --> 01:33:29,399
I, Prime Minister Yoon,

1799
01:33:29,399 --> 01:33:31,934
think that
deposing the Queen is just.

1800
01:33:31,934 --> 01:33:35,867


1801
01:33:35,867 --> 01:33:39,100
Since all of you are silent
you must all agree.

1802
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:41,001


1803
01:33:41,001 --> 01:33:43,567
Then it's done.
Leave the court.

1804
01:33:43,567 --> 01:33:48,167


1805
01:33:48,167 --> 01:33:51,634
I, Lord Lim, will speak.

1806
01:33:51,634 --> 01:33:52,634


1807
01:33:52,634 --> 01:33:55,300
The Queen is the mother
of this state.

1808
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:00,634
If you depose her due
to her maid's trivial sin,

1809
01:34:00,634 --> 01:34:03,801
please forgive me,

1810
01:34:03,801 --> 01:34:08,775
but it is unjust as a King
to punish a guiltless person.

1811
01:34:08,775 --> 01:34:10,867


1812
01:34:10,867 --> 01:34:16,067
Her maid confessed
that it is not the Queen's fault,

1813
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:20,201
so it is wise
not to depose the Queen.

1814
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:22,533
She is not only
the mother of your son,

1815
01:34:22,533 --> 01:34:26,634
but of all the officials
and people of this country.

1816
01:34:26,634 --> 01:34:30,067
So she is my mother, too.

1817
01:34:30,067 --> 01:34:32,067
This may be disloyal
to Your Majesty,

1818
01:34:32,067 --> 01:34:32,900


1819
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:38,067
but I cannot betray
my guiltless mother.

1820
01:34:38,067 --> 01:34:39,466


1821
01:34:39,466 --> 01:34:42,067
Your Majesty must handle this justly.

1822
01:34:42,067 --> 01:34:45,134
So please cancel your order

1823
01:34:45,134 --> 01:34:47,667
to depose the Queen.

1824
01:34:47,667 --> 01:34:53,100


1825
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:57,201
Maid Sam-weol carried poisons

1826
01:34:57,201 --> 01:34:59,699
and disturbed the palace.

1827
01:34:59,699 --> 01:35:04,167
So for breaking the law,
she should be hanged.

1828
01:35:04,167 --> 01:35:08,766
The head maid
didn't fulfill her duty

1829
01:35:08,766 --> 01:35:11,067
and allegedly delivered the letter.

1830
01:35:11,067 --> 01:35:13,533
So exile her after she's beaten.

1831
01:35:13,533 --> 01:35:14,033


1832
01:35:14,033 --> 01:35:18,833
Madam Shin brought
a spell book into the palace.

1833
01:35:18,833 --> 01:35:21,600
So she's forbidden to enter.

1834
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:33,201


1835
01:35:33,201 --> 01:35:37,000
Afterwards, your mother lived

1836
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,266
in solitude in her room,

1837
01:35:40,266 --> 01:35:45,201
and always slept weary
nights in her formal clothes.

1838
01:35:45,201 --> 01:35:48,432
She spent her days
in tears and sighs.

1839
01:35:48,432 --> 01:35:50,234
The King has arrived.

1840
01:35:50,234 --> 01:35:56,766


1841
01:35:56,766 --> 01:35:58,134
My dear.

1842
01:35:58,134 --> 01:35:58,934


1843
01:35:58,934 --> 01:36:00,600
The moon is so bright.

1844
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,766


1845
01:36:02,766 --> 01:36:06,501
Did you sleep
with your formal dress on?

1846
01:36:06,501 --> 01:36:10,466


1847
01:36:10,466 --> 01:36:11,466
My dear.

1848
01:36:11,466 --> 01:36:13,266


1849
01:36:13,266 --> 01:36:15,400
Please say something.

1850
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,934


1851
01:36:17,934 --> 01:36:20,067
It's too late to worry about me.

1852
01:36:20,067 --> 01:36:21,533


1853
01:36:21,533 --> 01:36:23,833
Sleep with my dress on?

1854
01:36:23,833 --> 01:36:26,667
My dear, please don't do this.

1855
01:36:26,667 --> 01:36:27,500


1856
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,867
It's all my fault.

1857
01:36:28,867 --> 01:36:30,632


1858
01:36:30,632 --> 01:36:33,533
The moon is bright
and you seek a woman.

1859
01:36:33,533 --> 01:36:34,567


1860
01:36:34,567 --> 01:36:37,266
Why didn't you go
to Concubine Uhm or Jung,

1861
01:36:37,266 --> 01:36:37,934


1862
01:36:37,934 --> 01:36:41,966
and come back
to a viscous woman like me?

1863
01:36:41,966 --> 01:36:43,266


1864
01:36:43,266 --> 01:36:45,899
Don't bring up the past.

1865
01:36:45,899 --> 01:36:46,833


1866
01:36:46,833 --> 01:36:48,100
Just go to sleep.

1867
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:49,934


1868
01:36:49,934 --> 01:36:51,833
Why shouldn't I?

1869
01:36:51,833 --> 01:36:52,699


1870
01:36:52,699 --> 01:36:56,301
You smile with glee
by just hearing her name.

1871
01:36:56,301 --> 01:36:58,800
So why should I stop?

1872
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,301


1873
01:37:00,301 --> 01:37:01,867
That wench.

1874
01:37:01,867 --> 01:37:03,699
I'll get her back for this.

1875
01:37:03,699 --> 01:37:04,966
My dear,

1876
01:37:04,966 --> 01:37:09,466
you are the mother of this land,
where are your manners?

1877
01:37:09,466 --> 01:37:10,766
Mother of this land?

1878
01:37:10,766 --> 01:37:11,800


1879
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:16,067
You adore the concubines
who disgraced the Queen.

1880
01:37:16,067 --> 01:37:16,800


1881
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,632
You think I'm a liar,
and I have no manners now?

1882
01:37:20,632 --> 01:37:21,667


1883
01:37:21,667 --> 01:37:23,400
Get out.

1884
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:26,567
Go to Concubine Jung
and have your fun.

1885
01:37:26,567 --> 01:37:28,134
My dear.

1886
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:29,833
You hate me that much?

1887
01:37:29,833 --> 01:37:32,899
Go away. I despise you.

1888
01:37:32,899 --> 01:37:34,966


1889
01:37:34,966 --> 01:37:37,500
Think about it, Majesty,

1890
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,333


1891
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:42,333
you let Sam-weol get hanged,

1892
01:37:42,333 --> 01:37:43,400


1893
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:48,167
and forbade my mother
to even visit me.

1894
01:37:48,167 --> 01:37:49,199


1895
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:51,501
How could you be so cruel?

1896
01:37:51,501 --> 01:37:52,466


1897
01:37:52,466 --> 01:37:55,466
That night I weaved for you,

1898
01:37:55,466 --> 01:37:56,167


1899
01:37:56,167 --> 01:37:59,832
you came to me
and I measured you.

1900
01:37:59,832 --> 01:38:00,400


1901
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,234
Do you remember
what you told me?

1902
01:38:03,234 --> 01:38:03,932


1903
01:38:03,932 --> 01:38:06,966
I've never imagined
you'd do this to me.

1904
01:38:06,966 --> 01:38:08,199
Never.

1905
01:38:08,199 --> 01:38:09,134


1906
01:38:09,134 --> 01:38:10,100
My dear.

1907
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:10,800


1908
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:14,434
Didn't I say
that it was all my fault?

1909
01:38:14,434 --> 01:38:15,266


1910
01:38:15,266 --> 01:38:17,867
- My dear.
- Go away.

1911
01:38:17,867 --> 01:38:18,932
Stop it.

1912
01:38:18,932 --> 01:38:19,501


1913
01:38:19,501 --> 01:38:20,600
My dear.

1914
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,932


1915
01:38:22,932 --> 01:38:25,301
- Let go of me.
- My dear.

1916
01:38:25,301 --> 01:38:27,466
Please, stop it.

1917
01:38:27,466 --> 01:38:30,400
After three years had passed,

1918
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:35,228
the King went to her that night

1919
01:38:35,228 --> 01:38:37,466
and spent it with her.

1920
01:38:37,466 --> 01:38:42,899


1921
01:38:42,899 --> 01:38:48,533
But the King and Queen's
night together

1922
01:38:48,533 --> 01:38:49,266


1923
01:38:49,266 --> 01:38:51,899
was discovered

1924
01:38:51,899 --> 01:38:55,966
by Queen Mother the next morning

1925
01:38:55,966 --> 01:38:57,932
when she heard about

1926
01:38:57,932 --> 01:38:58,434


1927
01:38:58,434 --> 01:39:02,000
a red scar on his face.

1928
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,167


1929
01:39:03,167 --> 01:39:06,434
The King has arrived.

1930
01:39:06,434 --> 01:39:30,367


1931
01:39:30,367 --> 01:39:35,832
How did you get
that scar on your face?

1932
01:39:35,832 --> 01:39:36,266


1933
01:39:36,266 --> 01:39:37,301
What?

1934
01:39:37,301 --> 01:39:38,899


1935
01:39:38,899 --> 01:39:40,600
How did this happen?

1936
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,067


1937
01:39:41,067 --> 01:39:44,363
Who dare do this
to the King's face?

1938
01:39:44,363 --> 01:39:45,567


1939
01:39:45,567 --> 01:39:47,067
Tell me who did it.

1940
01:39:47,067 --> 01:39:47,734


1941
01:39:47,734 --> 01:39:51,667
It's nothing,
nothing to worry about.

1942
01:39:51,667 --> 01:39:53,100
It's nothing?

1943
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:55,033


1944
01:39:55,033 --> 01:39:57,867
Your body is from
your royal ancestors

1945
01:39:57,867 --> 01:40:00,567
and you call that scar nothing?

1946
01:40:00,567 --> 01:40:01,833


1947
01:40:01,833 --> 01:40:04,699
- Where's the King's escort?
- Yes, Madam.

1948
01:40:04,699 --> 01:40:07,000
Who served the King last night?

1949
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:07,899


1950
01:40:07,899 --> 01:40:09,600
Answer me!

1951
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,600


1952
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:12,833
The Queen.

1953
01:40:12,833 --> 01:40:13,533


1954
01:40:13,533 --> 01:40:15,100
What?

1955
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:16,632
The Queen?

1956
01:40:16,632 --> 01:40:18,800


1957
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:22,567
Why didn't you stay away
from that disgraceful Queen?

1958
01:40:22,567 --> 01:40:23,201


1959
01:40:23,201 --> 01:40:25,833
I knew this would happen.

1960
01:40:25,833 --> 01:40:29,699


1961
01:40:29,699 --> 01:40:33,100
Our country is at risk.

1962
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:37,667
Mother, your voice is too loud.
Please, calm down.

1963
01:40:37,667 --> 01:40:40,800
Call the ministers,
and depose her now.

1964
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,500


1965
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:45,632
If you had listened to me earlier
this wouldn't have happened.

1966
01:40:45,632 --> 01:40:46,567


1967
01:40:46,567 --> 01:40:49,632
If you oppose me this time

1968
01:40:49,632 --> 01:40:51,632
I will leave this palace.

1969
01:40:51,632 --> 01:40:53,533


1970
01:40:53,533 --> 01:40:58,699
The palace was in turmoil
over the Queen again.

1971
01:40:58,699 --> 01:40:59,600


1972
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:04,466
Your mother was accused
of scratching the King's face

1973
01:41:04,466 --> 01:41:07,800
and she was kicked out of the palace.

1974
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:10,667


1975
01:41:10,667 --> 01:41:11,833
Thank you.

1976
01:41:11,833 --> 01:41:14,134


1977
01:41:14,134 --> 01:41:18,632
You served me well for so long.

1978
01:41:18,632 --> 01:41:19,766


1979
01:41:19,766 --> 01:41:21,734
I'm exiled as a criminal

1980
01:41:21,734 --> 01:41:22,266


1981
01:41:22,266 --> 01:41:25,667
but I ask you one last favor.

1982
01:41:25,667 --> 01:41:26,501


1983
01:41:26,501 --> 01:41:29,367
What is it, my Queen?

1984
01:41:29,367 --> 01:41:30,632
My prince.

1985
01:41:30,632 --> 01:41:34,134


1986
01:41:34,134 --> 01:41:35,567
I'm never to return,

1987
01:41:35,567 --> 01:41:36,600


1988
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:40,699
so I would like
to meet him one last time.

1989
01:41:40,699 --> 01:41:43,533


1990
01:41:43,533 --> 01:41:46,833
Please ask the King
to permit it.

1991
01:41:46,833 --> 01:41:47,899


1992
01:41:47,899 --> 01:41:49,033
Yes,

1993
01:41:49,033 --> 01:41:50,167


1994
01:41:50,167 --> 01:41:52,201
I will ask His Majesty.

1995
01:41:52,201 --> 01:42:14,100


1996
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:16,301
I have a message, Your Majesty.

1997
01:42:16,301 --> 01:42:19,400


1998
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:24,167
Before the Queen
leaves the palace forever,

1999
01:42:24,167 --> 01:42:27,234
she asks to meet the prince,

2000
01:42:27,234 --> 01:42:29,333
just for one last time.

2001
01:42:29,333 --> 01:42:30,134


2002
01:42:30,134 --> 01:42:35,567
I hope Your Majesty
will show her mercy.

2003
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:37,466
Meet the prince?

2004
01:42:37,466 --> 01:42:38,899
Yes, Your Majesty.

2005
01:42:38,899 --> 01:42:40,033


2006
01:42:40,033 --> 01:42:42,333
Queen Mother has arrived.

2007
01:42:42,333 --> 01:42:47,800


2008
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:52,301
What are you doing here?
Did the Queen leave?

2009
01:42:52,301 --> 01:42:54,800
Very soon, Queen Mother.

2010
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:57,167
So why are you here?

2011
01:42:57,167 --> 01:42:58,932


2012
01:42:58,932 --> 01:43:03,199
The Queen wants to meet
her son for one last time.

2013
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:04,134
What?

2014
01:43:04,134 --> 01:43:04,832


2015
01:43:04,832 --> 01:43:06,033
Meet the prince?

2016
01:43:06,033 --> 01:43:11,832


2017
01:43:11,832 --> 01:43:13,234
What will you do?

2018
01:43:13,234 --> 01:43:14,333


2019
01:43:14,333 --> 01:43:16,434
In my opinion,

2020
01:43:16,434 --> 01:43:19,400
it could leave
a bad impression on him.

2021
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:19,932


2022
01:43:19,932 --> 01:43:22,434
So you'd better not permit it.

2023
01:43:22,434 --> 01:43:26,301


2024
01:43:26,301 --> 01:43:29,932
Go and tell her she can't.

2025
01:43:29,932 --> 01:43:31,033
Yes, Your Majesty.

2026
01:43:31,033 --> 01:43:34,234


2027
01:43:34,234 --> 01:43:36,333
What a shameless woman.

2028
01:43:36,333 --> 01:43:42,567


2029
01:43:42,567 --> 01:43:43,567
Majesty,

2030
01:43:43,567 --> 01:43:44,567


2031
01:43:44,567 --> 01:43:47,701
I wanted to drink today.

2032
01:43:47,701 --> 01:43:52,199
So I prepared a small feast
in the palace garden.

2033
01:43:52,199 --> 01:43:55,033
Please wait for me.

2034
01:43:55,033 --> 01:43:56,367
I will be there soon.

2035
01:43:56,367 --> 01:43:58,667
Then please hurry.

2036
01:43:58,667 --> 01:44:25,766


2037
01:44:25,766 --> 01:44:27,300
Listen.

2038
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:28,300


2039
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:33,033
Take the prince and let him
meet his mother.

2040
01:44:33,033 --> 01:44:34,300
Yes, Majesty.

2041
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:35,634


2042
01:44:35,634 --> 01:44:39,333
Avoid Queen Mother.
Understand?

2043
01:44:39,333 --> 01:44:43,067
Yes, Your Majesty is so kind.

2044
01:44:43,067 --> 01:45:10,266


2045
01:45:10,266 --> 01:45:13,033
My Queen!

2046
01:45:13,033 --> 01:45:14,634
My Queen!

2047
01:45:14,634 --> 01:45:18,466
- My Prince.
- My Queen.

2048
01:45:18,466 --> 01:45:19,466
My Prince.

2049
01:45:19,466 --> 01:45:22,033


2050
01:45:22,033 --> 01:45:23,333
My Prince.

2051
01:45:23,333 --> 01:45:35,100


2052
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:40,100
Don't forget my face, my prince.

2053
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:41,667


2054
01:45:41,667 --> 01:45:45,399
Grow up

2055
01:45:45,399 --> 01:45:46,033


2056
01:45:46,033 --> 01:45:48,132
to be a great King.

2057
01:45:48,132 --> 01:45:52,234


2058
01:45:52,234 --> 01:45:54,000
My Prince.

2059
01:45:54,000 --> 01:46:02,533


2060
01:46:02,533 --> 01:46:03,766
Mother!

2061
01:46:03,766 --> 01:46:04,399


2062
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:05,634
Mother!

2063
01:46:05,634 --> 01:46:07,682


2064
01:46:07,682 --> 01:46:10,997
- Mother!
- My Queen!

2065
01:46:10,997 --> 01:46:12,399


2066
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:16,266
After your mother was deposed

2067
01:46:16,266 --> 01:46:18,167
and exiled from the palace

2068
01:46:18,167 --> 01:46:19,300


2069
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:25,801
her beautiful black hair
became piled with dirt,

2070
01:46:25,801 --> 01:46:30,067
and the grief in her heart
made her ill.

2071
01:46:30,067 --> 01:46:42,600


2072
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:43,701
Mother,

2073
01:46:43,701 --> 01:46:44,600


2074
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:46,033
look at this.

2075
01:46:46,033 --> 01:46:46,567


2076
01:46:46,567 --> 01:46:48,367
Blood came out.

2077
01:46:48,367 --> 01:46:48,900


2078
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:50,600
My daughter,

2079
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:51,399


2080
01:46:51,399 --> 01:46:54,634
try to get some rest.

2081
01:46:54,634 --> 01:46:56,033


2082
01:46:56,033 --> 01:46:57,367
Mother,

2083
01:46:57,367 --> 01:46:58,766


2084
01:46:58,766 --> 01:47:01,434
I want to live for a long time

2085
01:47:01,434 --> 01:47:02,199


2086
01:47:02,199 --> 01:47:04,333
and see my son

2087
01:47:04,333 --> 01:47:08,199
becomes King.

2088
01:47:08,199 --> 01:47:10,001


2089
01:47:10,001 --> 01:47:11,701
You will.

2090
01:47:11,701 --> 01:47:13,033


2091
01:47:13,033 --> 01:47:15,399
But at that time,

2092
01:47:15,399 --> 01:47:16,234


2093
01:47:16,234 --> 01:47:20,667
any existence of your mother
was made forbidden,

2094
01:47:20,667 --> 01:47:21,399


2095
01:47:21,399 --> 01:47:23,466
and they deceived you

2096
01:47:23,466 --> 01:47:27,734
by replacing her.

2097
01:47:27,734 --> 01:47:28,701
Understand?

2098
01:47:28,701 --> 01:47:30,501


2099
01:47:30,501 --> 01:47:33,033
Now, everyone leave.

2100
01:47:33,033 --> 01:48:14,900


2101
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:19,734
Why aren't you asleep
and playing the pipe?

2102
01:48:19,734 --> 01:48:21,899
Let me try it once.

2103
01:48:21,899 --> 01:48:47,500


2104
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:49,000
Go to bed now.

2105
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,132


2106
01:48:51,132 --> 01:48:53,634
And don't study too much.

2107
01:48:53,634 --> 01:48:57,533
Go out often, and exercise
your mind and body.

2108
01:48:57,533 --> 01:49:00,867
Observe the people to learn

2109
01:49:00,867 --> 01:49:03,266
how to become a wise King.

2110
01:49:03,266 --> 01:49:04,177


2111
01:49:04,177 --> 01:49:05,534
Yes.

2112
01:49:05,534 --> 01:50:15,734


2113
01:50:15,734 --> 01:50:17,634
I have returned, father.

2114
01:50:17,634 --> 01:50:21,367
Did you see
something interesting today?

2115
01:50:21,367 --> 01:50:22,634


2116
01:50:22,634 --> 01:50:25,833
There was nothing to see.

2117
01:50:25,833 --> 01:50:28,001
But I went out
of the south gate,

2118
01:50:28,001 --> 01:50:31,701
and I saw a calf
chasing its mother.

2119
01:50:31,701 --> 01:50:34,600
Chasing its mother,
the calf answered,

2120
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:37,734
and when the calf called,
its mother answered.

2121
01:50:37,734 --> 01:50:38,367


2122
01:50:38,367 --> 01:50:43,478
Although they were animals,
their affection was moving.

2123
01:50:43,478 --> 01:50:45,966


2124
01:50:45,966 --> 01:50:48,695
- Now, go inside.
- Yes, your Majesty.

2125
01:50:48,695 --> 01:50:52,167


2126
01:50:52,167 --> 01:50:53,158
Listen here.

2127
01:50:53,158 --> 01:50:54,912


2128
01:50:54,912 --> 01:50:56,166
Yes, Your Majesty.

2129
01:50:56,166 --> 01:50:57,600


2130
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:58,934
Call my secretary.

2131
01:50:58,934 --> 01:51:04,332


2132
01:51:04,332 --> 01:51:07,533
I have arrived,
Your Majesty.

2133
01:51:07,533 --> 01:51:09,567


2134
01:51:09,567 --> 01:51:14,634
Visit the deposed Queen,
and check how she is recently.

2135
01:51:14,634 --> 01:51:15,734
Yes, Majesty.

2136
01:51:15,734 --> 01:51:18,100


2137
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:21,167
Find out whether
she repents her sin

2138
01:51:21,167 --> 01:51:22,466
or not.

2139
01:51:22,466 --> 01:51:23,190


2140
01:51:23,190 --> 01:51:26,800
I will do as
Your Majesty wishes.

2141
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:27,399


2142
01:51:27,399 --> 01:51:29,167
When you return,

2143
01:51:29,167 --> 01:51:29,966


2144
01:51:29,966 --> 01:51:34,432
tell the King
she hasn't repented yet

2145
01:51:34,432 --> 01:51:35,500


2146
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:37,600
and that she does everything
to defy him.

2147
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:38,600


2148
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:40,067
And tell the King

2149
01:51:40,067 --> 01:51:44,033
that she viciously insults him.

2150
01:51:44,033 --> 01:51:45,699


2151
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:47,500
If you don't obey me,

2152
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:51,266
and tell the King otherwise,

2153
01:51:51,266 --> 01:51:52,766
you will die.

2154
01:51:52,766 --> 01:51:54,899
I will obey.

2155
01:51:54,899 --> 01:51:56,466


2156
01:51:56,466 --> 01:51:57,466
Then go.

2157
01:51:57,466 --> 01:52:14,567


2158
01:52:14,567 --> 01:52:16,867
Oh, goodness.

2159
01:52:16,867 --> 01:52:17,699


2160
01:52:17,699 --> 01:52:20,934
What brings you
to our lowly home?

2161
01:52:20,934 --> 01:52:22,067
Hello, Madam.

2162
01:52:22,067 --> 01:52:23,033


2163
01:52:23,033 --> 01:52:27,134
The King's secretary is here.

2164
01:52:27,134 --> 01:52:29,466
Open the door and greet him.

2165
01:52:29,466 --> 01:52:34,067


2166
01:52:34,067 --> 01:52:36,033
How have you been?

2167
01:52:36,033 --> 01:52:37,600
How do you do?

2168
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:38,134


2169
01:52:38,134 --> 01:52:41,600
It's been hard for you, hasn't it?

2170
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:42,500


2171
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:44,667
How is the King?

2172
01:52:44,667 --> 01:52:49,333


2173
01:52:49,333 --> 01:52:50,966
How is my Prince?

2174
01:52:50,966 --> 01:52:51,600


2175
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:54,201
- They're fine.
- Thank goodness.

2176
01:52:54,201 --> 01:52:57,367
Please, help us.

2177
01:52:57,367 --> 01:52:58,201


2178
01:52:58,201 --> 01:53:02,000
I beg you to tell the King

2179
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,234
and the prince of her love.

2180
01:53:05,234 --> 01:53:07,567


2181
01:53:07,567 --> 01:53:08,632
Mother,

2182
01:53:08,632 --> 01:53:09,234


2183
01:53:09,234 --> 01:53:10,832
please don't.

2184
01:53:10,832 --> 01:53:12,134


2185
01:53:12,134 --> 01:53:17,167
I'm a deposed criminal
who is very ill now.

2186
01:53:17,167 --> 01:53:22,067
If they learn this,
it will only worry them.

2187
01:53:22,067 --> 01:53:26,333


2188
01:53:26,333 --> 01:53:30,033
Please, don't mention me.

2189
01:53:30,033 --> 01:53:31,067


2190
01:53:31,067 --> 01:53:35,333
Just tell them
I'm repenting my sin

2191
01:53:35,333 --> 01:53:36,100


2192
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:39,800
and that I'm doing well.

2193
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:43,266


2194
01:53:43,266 --> 01:53:44,234
Yes.

2195
01:53:44,234 --> 01:53:52,400


2196
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:56,333
How could I betray
such a kind woman?

2197
01:53:56,333 --> 01:53:56,899


2198
01:53:56,899 --> 01:53:58,899
I'm a brave man, too.

2199
01:53:58,899 --> 01:54:01,600
Even if my life is threatened,

2200
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,033
I will tell the truth.

2201
01:54:03,033 --> 01:54:09,266


2202
01:54:09,266 --> 01:54:11,033
Come closer.

2203
01:54:11,033 --> 01:54:17,667


2204
01:54:17,667 --> 01:54:20,400
So how is she?

2205
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:21,766


2206
01:54:21,766 --> 01:54:23,632
Please forgive me.

2207
01:54:23,632 --> 01:54:24,400


2208
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,400
What is there to forgive?

2209
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,333
Please forgive me.

2210
01:54:28,333 --> 01:54:29,699
Tell me now.

2211
01:54:29,699 --> 01:54:30,800


2212
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:33,632
Then just tell us what you saw.

2213
01:54:33,632 --> 01:54:40,067


2214
01:54:40,067 --> 01:54:42,800
Has she not repented yet?

2215
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:43,699


2216
01:54:43,699 --> 01:54:46,733
And defy the King?

2217
01:54:46,733 --> 01:54:51,067


2218
01:54:51,067 --> 01:54:52,100
Yes.

2219
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:53,600


2220
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:55,632
She hasn't repented yet

2221
01:54:55,632 --> 01:54:56,867


2222
01:54:56,867 --> 01:54:59,167
and defies Your Majesty.

2223
01:54:59,167 --> 01:55:02,501


2224
01:55:02,501 --> 01:55:04,367
Also...

2225
01:55:04,367 --> 01:55:05,434


2226
01:55:05,434 --> 01:55:06,567
What else?

2227
01:55:06,567 --> 01:55:07,067


2228
01:55:07,067 --> 01:55:08,600
Tell me.

2229
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:09,733


2230
01:55:09,733 --> 01:55:11,600
She said that as long as she lives,

2231
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:13,966


2232
01:55:13,966 --> 01:55:16,100
she will seek justice.

2233
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:17,201
What?

2234
01:55:17,201 --> 01:55:18,766


2235
01:55:18,766 --> 01:55:20,434
Majesty,

2236
01:55:20,434 --> 01:55:21,699
please calm down.

2237
01:55:21,699 --> 01:55:22,667


2238
01:55:22,667 --> 01:55:26,100
Repeat what you just said.

2239
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:30,033


2240
01:55:30,033 --> 01:55:31,966
She said if she lives longer,

2241
01:55:31,966 --> 01:55:34,367


2242
01:55:34,367 --> 01:55:36,766
she wants to seek justice.

2243
01:55:36,766 --> 01:55:40,832


2244
01:55:40,832 --> 01:55:43,067
That's enough.

2245
01:55:43,067 --> 01:55:45,301


2246
01:55:45,301 --> 01:55:46,333
You can go.

2247
01:55:46,333 --> 01:55:49,667


2248
01:55:49,667 --> 01:55:52,932
Majesty, she's dangerous.

2249
01:55:52,932 --> 01:55:55,867
She will spoil the prince
if she lives.

2250
01:55:55,867 --> 01:55:56,434


2251
01:55:56,434 --> 01:55:59,733
I'm very worried
for this country.

2252
01:55:59,733 --> 01:56:02,134


2253
01:56:02,134 --> 01:56:04,634
Punish her. With poison.

2254
01:56:04,634 --> 01:56:06,501


2255
01:56:06,501 --> 01:56:08,234
It's the only way.

2256
01:56:08,234 --> 01:56:09,466


2257
01:56:09,466 --> 01:56:11,266
Human life is precious.

2258
01:56:11,266 --> 01:56:12,234


2259
01:56:12,234 --> 01:56:15,501
I need more time to think.

2260
01:56:15,501 --> 01:56:17,932


2261
01:56:17,932 --> 01:56:20,966
Why do you need more time?

2262
01:56:20,966 --> 01:56:21,634


2263
01:56:21,634 --> 01:56:24,367
Order it right away.

2264
01:56:24,367 --> 01:56:30,067


2265
01:56:30,067 --> 01:56:33,100
Mother, please,
open the window,

2266
01:56:33,100 --> 01:56:34,567
I want to see the moon.

2267
01:56:34,567 --> 01:56:43,434


2268
01:56:43,434 --> 01:56:48,266
There's a beautiful
full moon tonight.

2269
01:56:48,266 --> 01:56:49,932


2270
01:56:49,932 --> 01:56:53,966
It doesn't matter
if it's full or not.

2271
01:56:53,966 --> 01:56:55,033


2272
01:56:55,033 --> 01:56:57,501
The King's secretary,

2273
01:56:57,501 --> 01:56:58,932


2274
01:56:58,932 --> 01:57:02,000
isn't he such a kind man?

2275
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,367
If he's human, he'll pity you.

2276
01:57:05,367 --> 01:57:06,234


2277
01:57:06,234 --> 01:57:10,033
I pray to the gods
that they'll pity you.

2278
01:57:10,033 --> 01:57:13,600
And if the King makes
you a Queen again,

2279
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,701


2280
01:57:14,701 --> 01:57:19,634
I can die peacefully now,
without any grief.

2281
01:57:19,634 --> 01:57:21,300


2282
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:22,434
Mother,

2283
01:57:22,434 --> 01:57:23,434


2284
01:57:23,434 --> 01:57:25,100
you mustn't die.

2285
01:57:25,100 --> 01:57:26,333


2286
01:57:26,333 --> 01:57:28,466
You must live longer,

2287
01:57:28,466 --> 01:57:29,801


2288
01:57:29,801 --> 01:57:32,134
until I return for you,

2289
01:57:32,134 --> 01:57:33,033


2290
01:57:33,033 --> 01:57:37,434
so I can make
the rest of your life happy.

2291
01:57:37,434 --> 01:57:38,033


2292
01:57:38,033 --> 01:57:42,434
Will that day really come?

2293
01:57:42,434 --> 01:57:43,266


2294
01:57:43,266 --> 01:57:45,367
I have a feeling

2295
01:57:45,367 --> 01:57:46,300


2296
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:49,567
that good news will come soon.

2297
01:57:49,567 --> 01:57:51,067


2298
01:57:51,067 --> 01:57:54,067
I hope so, too.

2299
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:56,199


2300
01:57:56,199 --> 01:57:59,333
Moon, moon,

2301
01:57:59,333 --> 01:58:01,300
Bright moon

2302
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:02,734


2303
01:58:02,734 --> 01:58:06,734
The moon where Poet Li-po drinks

2304
01:58:06,734 --> 01:58:08,500


2305
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:13,890
There, there in that moon

2306
01:58:13,890 --> 01:58:14,701


2307
01:58:14,701 --> 01:58:19,000
The great laurel tree

2308
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,234


2309
01:58:20,234 --> 01:58:24,301
in the moon

2310
01:58:24,301 --> 01:58:25,932


2311
01:58:25,932 --> 01:58:31,067
Cutting it

2312
01:58:31,067 --> 01:58:31,899


2313
01:58:31,899 --> 01:58:36,167
with a jade axe

2314
01:58:36,167 --> 01:58:37,333


2315
01:58:37,333 --> 01:58:43,037
Trimming it

2316
01:58:43,037 --> 01:58:47,434
with a golden axe

2317
01:58:47,434 --> 01:58:48,867


2318
01:58:48,867 --> 01:58:53,867
Building

2319
01:58:53,867 --> 01:58:58,167
a small house

2320
01:58:58,167 --> 01:58:59,199


2321
01:58:59,199 --> 01:59:03,801
Living

2322
01:59:03,801 --> 01:59:04,867


2323
01:59:04,867 --> 01:59:08,367
with my parents

2324
01:59:08,367 --> 01:59:23,333


2325
01:59:23,333 --> 01:59:25,900
Are they coming for us?

2326
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:37,100


2327
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:38,600
The King commands you.

2328
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:39,766


2329
01:59:39,766 --> 01:59:40,966
The King?

2330
01:59:40,966 --> 01:59:47,766


2331
01:59:47,766 --> 01:59:50,766
- My daughter.
- Accept the King's command.

2332
01:59:50,766 --> 01:59:52,833


2333
01:59:52,833 --> 01:59:53,900
My daughter.

2334
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:55,966


2335
01:59:55,966 --> 01:59:58,233
The King asks to see you.

2336
01:59:58,233 --> 01:59:59,934
The King?

2337
01:59:59,934 --> 02:00:02,199
You were right last night.

2338
02:00:02,199 --> 02:00:05,500
Your premonition was right.

2339
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:06,900


2340
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:09,667
You may become Queen again.

2341
02:00:09,667 --> 02:00:12,533
It must be good news.

2342
02:00:12,533 --> 02:00:16,266
Hurry and get ready.
Go accept his command.

2343
02:00:16,266 --> 02:00:20,567


2344
02:00:20,567 --> 02:00:22,934
Heed the King's command.

2345
02:00:22,934 --> 02:00:23,966
Yes, Sir.

2346
02:00:23,966 --> 02:00:28,801


2347
02:00:28,801 --> 02:00:32,399
Even if you
can't dress like a Queen,

2348
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:37,399
you should put on
a Queen's veil.

2349
02:00:37,399 --> 02:00:38,434
Here.

2350
02:00:38,434 --> 02:00:41,801


2351
02:00:41,801 --> 02:00:45,766
My hands shake
so much I can't put it on.

2352
02:00:45,766 --> 02:00:47,867
My poor daughter.

2353
02:00:47,867 --> 02:00:48,701


2354
02:00:48,701 --> 02:00:50,734
I feel faint.

2355
02:00:50,734 --> 02:00:55,199


2356
02:00:55,199 --> 02:00:59,266
Bow and accept
the King's command.

2357
02:00:59,266 --> 02:01:42,533


2358
02:01:42,533 --> 02:01:45,533
Your character is vile

2359
02:01:45,533 --> 02:01:47,766
and unmannered.

2360
02:01:47,766 --> 02:01:52,300
As a Queen, your behavior
was unacceptable.

2361
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:54,934
You insulted the royal throne.

2362
02:01:54,934 --> 02:01:58,934
Also, you said
you'll seek justice forever.

2363
02:01:58,934 --> 02:02:03,067
If you return as Queen,
bearing this evil mind,

2364
02:02:03,067 --> 02:02:06,867
though the prince is wise
he won't be able to rule.

2365
02:02:06,867 --> 02:02:07,701


2366
02:02:07,701 --> 02:02:11,001
King Mu of China killed

2367
02:02:11,001 --> 02:02:13,900
his innocent wife for his country.

2368
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:19,266
So if I forgive my evil wife again,
it will be immoral.

2369
02:02:19,266 --> 02:02:23,266
So I order Queen Yoon
to be poisoned.

2370
02:02:23,266 --> 02:02:24,900


2371
02:02:24,900 --> 02:02:27,701
No.
How could this be?

2372
02:02:27,701 --> 02:02:29,600


2373
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:33,567
Let me see for myself.
There must be a mistake.

2374
02:02:33,567 --> 02:02:35,001


2375
02:02:35,001 --> 02:02:36,199
Mother?

2376
02:02:36,199 --> 02:02:37,701


2377
02:02:37,701 --> 02:02:39,667
Why should I be killed?

2378
02:02:39,667 --> 02:02:40,734


2379
02:02:40,734 --> 02:02:42,934
Why should I die?

2380
02:02:42,934 --> 02:02:45,533
I'm innocent, mother.

2381
02:02:45,533 --> 02:02:46,966


2382
02:02:46,966 --> 02:02:49,734
Why did I go to the palace?

2383
02:02:49,734 --> 02:02:53,199
Do I have to die like this, mother?

2384
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:53,801


2385
02:02:53,801 --> 02:02:54,900
Mother?

2386
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:55,500


2387
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:57,332
This can't be.

2388
02:02:57,332 --> 02:02:58,600


2389
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:00,833
My poor daughter.

2390
02:03:00,833 --> 02:03:02,701


2391
02:03:02,701 --> 02:03:05,966
She waited for 10 years in tears,

2392
02:03:05,966 --> 02:03:06,600


2393
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:11,100
hoping one day that the King
will have pity on her.

2394
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:12,001


2395
02:03:12,001 --> 02:03:15,634
My daughter,
why does she have to die?

2396
02:03:15,634 --> 02:03:16,266


2397
02:03:16,266 --> 02:03:17,533
My Lord,

2398
02:03:17,533 --> 02:03:18,300


2399
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:21,600
you can't kill her.
Kill me first!

2400
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:24,399
You can't kill her.
My poor daughter.

2401
02:03:24,399 --> 02:03:25,634
Mother.

2402
02:03:25,634 --> 02:03:34,399


2403
02:03:34,399 --> 02:03:37,567
Listen to me.
Hear my words.

2404
02:03:37,567 --> 02:03:39,199


2405
02:03:39,199 --> 02:03:44,001
Although I'm a deposed criminal
to be executed now,

2406
02:03:44,001 --> 02:03:45,600


2407
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:48,867
I was a Queen

2408
02:03:48,867 --> 02:03:51,332
and mother of the prince once.

2409
02:03:51,332 --> 02:03:51,966


2410
02:03:51,966 --> 02:03:56,567
Don't think I'm being impolite
for these words.

2411
02:03:56,567 --> 02:03:58,500


2412
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:00,900
Bring me the bowl.

2413
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:01,833
Yes, Madam.

2414
02:04:01,833 --> 02:04:09,701


2415
02:04:09,701 --> 02:04:10,801
My Daughter...

2416
02:04:10,801 --> 02:04:13,567


2417
02:04:13,567 --> 02:04:15,012
My Daughter!

2418
02:04:15,012 --> 02:04:19,533
After I die from this poison,

2419
02:04:19,533 --> 02:04:21,701


2420
02:04:21,701 --> 02:04:26,233
tell the King these last words:

2421
02:04:26,233 --> 02:04:28,199


2422
02:04:28,199 --> 02:04:30,466
I don't know what misfortune

2423
02:04:30,466 --> 02:04:31,367


2424
02:04:31,367 --> 02:04:35,867
caused me to be killed now,

2425
02:04:35,867 --> 02:04:39,332


2426
02:04:39,332 --> 02:04:43,567
but tell the King that I wish

2427
02:04:43,567 --> 02:04:44,867


2428
02:04:44,867 --> 02:04:47,734
he lives happily
with the prince forever.

2429
02:04:47,734 --> 02:04:50,100


2430
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:51,167
Also,

2431
02:04:51,167 --> 02:04:53,033


2432
02:04:53,033 --> 02:04:54,766
after I die,

2433
02:04:54,766 --> 02:04:56,432


2434
02:04:56,432 --> 02:04:59,500
bury me near the palace,

2435
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:00,934


2436
02:05:00,934 --> 02:05:04,201
so even as a poor spirit,

2437
02:05:04,201 --> 02:05:06,766
I could somehow see

2438
02:05:06,766 --> 02:05:09,766
the King's face once more.

2439
02:05:09,766 --> 02:05:18,067


2440
02:05:18,067 --> 02:05:20,567
My daughter!

2441
02:05:20,567 --> 02:05:28,766


2442
02:05:28,766 --> 02:05:30,001
Let go of me!

2443
02:05:30,001 --> 02:05:56,033


2444
02:05:56,033 --> 02:05:58,869
My daughter!

2445
02:05:58,869 --> 02:06:06,699


2446
02:06:06,699 --> 02:06:07,900
Mother.

2447
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:09,533


2448
02:06:09,533 --> 02:06:11,734
I'm leaving now.

2449
02:06:11,734 --> 02:06:12,699


2450
02:06:12,699 --> 02:06:15,466
When the prince becomes King,

2451
02:06:15,466 --> 02:06:16,634


2452
02:06:16,634 --> 02:06:21,100
give him this cloth full
of my blood and tears.

2453
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:21,800


2454
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:24,295
My daughter!

2455
02:06:24,295 --> 02:06:42,600


2456
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:43,632
Mother.

2457
02:06:43,632 --> 02:06:44,966


2458
02:06:44,966 --> 02:06:46,667
Mother!

2459
02:06:46,667 --> 02:06:49,239


2460
02:06:49,239 --> 02:06:50,534
Mother...

2461
02:06:50,534 --> 02:06:54,533


2462
02:06:54,533 --> 02:06:55,867
Is anybody outside?

2463
02:06:55,867 --> 02:06:56,634


2464
02:06:56,634 --> 02:06:58,033
Is anyone there?

2465
02:06:58,033 --> 02:06:59,966


2466
02:06:59,966 --> 02:07:02,167
- Is anyone there?
- Yes, my lord.

2467
02:07:02,167 --> 02:07:03,899


2468
02:07:03,899 --> 02:07:07,001
Arrest concubines
Jung and Um right away.

2469
02:07:07,001 --> 02:07:07,934


2470
02:07:07,934 --> 02:07:12,333
Call the penal officer
and prepare the torture chairs.

2471
02:07:12,333 --> 02:07:14,667
Evil witches!

2472
02:07:14,667 --> 02:07:18,600


2473
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:21,734
The penal officer is here.

2474
02:07:21,734 --> 02:07:22,634
Good.

2475
02:07:22,634 --> 02:07:26,567
The torture chairs and soldiers
are ready, Your Majesty.

2476
02:07:26,567 --> 02:07:27,833
Good.

2477
02:07:27,833 --> 02:07:31,833
Concubines Jung and Um
have been detained.

2478
02:07:31,833 --> 02:07:35,567


2479
02:07:35,567 --> 02:07:37,134
Tie them on the chairs.

2480
02:07:37,134 --> 02:07:38,134


2481
02:07:38,134 --> 02:07:41,134
Tie them on the chairs!

2482
02:07:41,134 --> 02:07:49,667


2483
02:07:49,667 --> 02:07:51,567
You evil witches!

2484
02:07:51,567 --> 02:07:54,567
Are you aware
of your crimes?

2485
02:07:54,567 --> 02:07:57,167


2486
02:07:57,167 --> 02:07:59,833
Why did you plot
against my mother!

2487
02:07:59,833 --> 02:08:02,634


2488
02:08:02,634 --> 02:08:07,001
You're the ones who made
my mother a criminal.

2489
02:08:07,001 --> 02:08:09,466


2490
02:08:09,466 --> 02:08:10,934
Answer me!

2491
02:08:10,934 --> 02:08:13,432


2492
02:08:13,432 --> 02:08:17,851
You evil witches, answer me!

2493
02:08:17,851 --> 02:08:24,900


2494
02:08:24,900 --> 02:08:27,737
Queen Mother has arrived!

2495
02:08:27,737 --> 02:08:30,234


2496
02:08:30,234 --> 02:08:32,367
Majesty.

2497
02:08:32,367 --> 02:08:33,466


2498
02:08:33,466 --> 02:08:34,934
What's the meaning of this?

2499
02:08:34,934 --> 02:08:35,966


2500
02:08:35,966 --> 02:08:39,201
They are your father's concubines.

2501
02:08:39,201 --> 02:08:40,500


2502
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:42,733
How could a son torture

2503
02:08:42,733 --> 02:08:43,234


2504
02:08:43,234 --> 02:08:46,201
his father's loved ones?

2505
02:08:46,201 --> 02:08:49,000
This is outrageous!

2506
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:50,266
What did you say?

2507
02:08:50,266 --> 02:08:52,234


2508
02:08:52,234 --> 02:08:55,215
You not only dishonored your father,

2509
02:08:55,215 --> 02:08:56,301


2510
02:08:56,301 --> 02:09:01,100
but how dare you beat them
with a King's hand?

2511
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:01,934


2512
02:09:01,934 --> 02:09:06,100
You worry for the concubines,
but what about my real mother?

2513
02:09:06,100 --> 02:09:06,867


2514
02:09:06,867 --> 02:09:09,234
If my torturing them is unjust,

2515
02:09:09,234 --> 02:09:11,966
what to say about you
poisoning my mother?

2516
02:09:11,966 --> 02:09:13,301
What did you say?

2517
02:09:13,301 --> 02:09:15,067
My mother.

2518
02:09:15,067 --> 02:09:18,134
You drove my mother to death,
didn't you?

2519
02:09:18,134 --> 02:09:18,667


2520
02:09:18,667 --> 02:09:21,100
I did.
But that was different.

2521
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:22,301
What's the difference?

2522
02:09:22,301 --> 02:09:24,632
She wasn't poisoned as a Queen,

2523
02:09:24,632 --> 02:09:27,266
but as a deposed sinner
who was exiled.

2524
02:09:27,266 --> 02:09:30,100
What? A sinner?

2525
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:31,833


2526
02:09:31,833 --> 02:09:35,162
- Queen mother.
- Queen mother.

2527
02:09:35,162 --> 02:09:36,485


2528
02:09:36,485 --> 02:09:39,067
This is outrageous!

2529
02:09:39,067 --> 02:09:41,766


2530
02:09:41,766 --> 02:09:43,201
Heed my words.

2531
02:09:43,201 --> 02:09:44,333


2532
02:09:44,333 --> 02:09:46,667
Carry out these commands.

2533
02:09:46,667 --> 02:09:49,266
Arrest all the officials
who permitted my mother's death,

2534
02:09:49,266 --> 02:09:52,766
and the ones
who wrongfully accused her,

2535
02:09:52,766 --> 02:09:56,333
and the treacherous bastards
who went to execute her.

2536
02:09:56,333 --> 02:09:58,966
Arrest all of them this instant!

2537
02:09:58,966 --> 02:10:00,067


2538
02:10:00,067 --> 02:10:01,800
Arrest all who tried

2539
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:05,966
to split up my father and mother.

2540
02:10:05,966 --> 02:10:08,867


2541
02:10:08,867 --> 02:10:12,333
I knew this disaster would happen.

2542
02:10:12,333 --> 02:10:13,167


2543
02:10:13,167 --> 02:10:16,100
I'm not sure if I will live today.

2544
02:10:16,100 --> 02:10:20,367
If we got rid
of Madam Shin as I said,

2545
02:10:20,367 --> 02:10:22,134
this wouldn't have happened.

2546
02:10:22,134 --> 02:10:24,367
Watch your mouth.

2547
02:10:24,367 --> 02:10:27,400
What will happen to this country?

2548
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:27,934


2549
02:10:27,934 --> 02:10:30,699
If I'm late, don't wait too long.

2550
02:10:30,699 --> 02:10:32,067


2551
02:10:32,067 --> 02:10:33,301
Let's go.

2552
02:10:33,301 --> 02:10:40,501


2553
02:10:40,501 --> 02:10:41,533
Stop.

2554
02:10:41,533 --> 02:10:42,301


2555
02:10:42,301 --> 02:10:44,201
Stop the beating.

2556
02:10:44,201 --> 02:10:50,033


2557
02:10:50,033 --> 02:10:52,067
Listen to me, ministers.

2558
02:10:52,067 --> 02:10:52,832


2559
02:10:52,832 --> 02:10:56,033
Officers Lee Se-ja
and Lee Saeng-geun

2560
02:10:56,033 --> 02:10:58,466
carried out my mother's execution,

2561
02:10:58,466 --> 02:11:01,434
so kill them with poison, too.

2562
02:11:01,434 --> 02:11:05,333
And cut off Secretary Kim's head
who served my father.

2563
02:11:05,333 --> 02:11:06,466


2564
02:11:06,466 --> 02:11:11,634
And the officials who decided
to permit my mother's death

2565
02:11:11,634 --> 02:11:15,867
and all the historians
of my father's era,

2566
02:11:15,867 --> 02:11:18,966
flog them all and exile them,

2567
02:11:18,966 --> 02:11:21,167
and have them wait for my next order.

2568
02:11:21,167 --> 02:11:22,932


2569
02:11:22,932 --> 02:11:26,033
Exile Concubine Jung's sons

2570
02:11:26,033 --> 02:11:30,533
as well as her daughters
to the corners of this country.

2571
02:11:30,533 --> 02:11:33,501
And cut off the heads
of her parents, too.

2572
02:11:33,501 --> 02:11:34,201


2573
02:11:34,201 --> 02:11:36,033
Ministers Jung, Han, and Shin

2574
02:11:36,033 --> 02:11:36,832


2575
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:39,867
didn't oppose
my mother's execution.

2576
02:11:39,867 --> 02:11:42,766
But even though they're already dead,

2577
02:11:42,766 --> 02:11:45,466
dig them out of the national tombs,

2578
02:11:45,466 --> 02:11:46,033


2579
02:11:46,033 --> 02:11:49,400
and smash their skeletons.

2580
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:52,634
Jung In-jee
was a praised high minister,

2581
02:11:52,634 --> 02:11:55,167
but he didn't stop
my mother's death.

2582
02:11:55,167 --> 02:11:59,201
So hold his memorial
as an ordinary man.

2583
02:11:59,201 --> 02:12:00,100


2584
02:12:00,100 --> 02:12:02,167
As you wish, Majesty.

2585
02:12:02,167 --> 02:12:03,701


2586
02:12:03,701 --> 02:12:06,832
A loyal official who serves the King

2587
02:12:06,832 --> 02:12:10,667
should always be consistent
with his words

2588
02:12:10,667 --> 02:12:13,966
I thought Minister Yoon
was a faithful man,

2589
02:12:13,966 --> 02:12:17,400
but you agreed to depose my mother.

2590
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:21,800
You pretended to be innocent
and agreed with all my orders.

2591
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:24,033
You're a very cunning old man.

2592
02:12:24,033 --> 02:12:25,167


2593
02:12:25,167 --> 02:12:27,466
Confiscate his property!

2594
02:12:27,466 --> 02:12:30,167
And hang him and his son!

2595
02:12:30,167 --> 02:12:32,033


2596
02:12:32,033 --> 02:12:35,333
Why are you hesitating?
Tie up this old hag now! Do it now!

2597
02:12:35,333 --> 02:12:35,899


2598
02:12:35,899 --> 02:12:39,300
I will speak, Majesty.

2599
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:39,800


2600
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:45,134
It is natural for Your Majesty
to mourn for the old Queen's death

2601
02:12:45,134 --> 02:12:46,567
but revenging the past...

2602
02:12:46,567 --> 02:12:47,400


2603
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:48,466
Damn you!

2604
02:12:48,466 --> 02:12:49,067


2605
02:12:49,067 --> 02:12:53,899
You worthless scholars
pretend to be well-spoken!

2606
02:12:53,899 --> 02:12:56,600
How dare you criticize me?

2607
02:12:56,600 --> 02:12:57,934
All right.

2608
02:12:57,934 --> 02:13:01,400
Then I will cut off
your well-spoken tongues!

2609
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:02,699
Listen here!

2610
02:13:02,699 --> 02:13:03,966


2611
02:13:03,966 --> 02:13:07,301
Throw them into prison
until I give my next order.

2612
02:13:07,301 --> 02:13:10,167
The country was in turmoil day by day

2613
02:13:10,167 --> 02:13:13,158
and the people's wrath
reached high into the sky.

2614
02:13:13,158 --> 02:13:16,411
A plot to depose King Yeon-san

2615
02:13:16,411 --> 02:13:19,199
and to save the country
was secretly made

2616
02:13:19,199 --> 02:13:22,701
by patriotic officials.

2617
02:13:22,701 --> 02:13:25,833
A revolution was being organized,

2618
02:13:25,833 --> 02:13:26,634


2619
02:13:26,634 --> 02:13:29,667
and the turbulent life
of King Yeon-san

2620
02:13:29,667 --> 02:13:32,434
was coming to the climax.

2621
02:13:32,434 --> 02:15:04,918


2622
02:15:04,918 --> 02:15:09,047
