1
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:30,809
My friends and I live happily

2
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:32,482
in a distant paradise.

3
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:35,686
Peace, quiet and tranquility

4
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:37,546
completely untouched by,

5
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,257
well, I don't even know
what it's untouched by,

6
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:41,389
we've never been touched...

7
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,148
I was just touched by

8
00:00:42,426 --> 00:00:43,621
a touching romance novel.

9
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:47,592
I baked some cookies
with a touch of nutmeg.

10
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:51,198
I'm touching my
nose with my tongue.

11
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:53,631
- Will you guys get out of here!
- No need to get touchy.

12
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:55,235
Hey I said we were happy,

13
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,668
I didn't say we weren't
off our rockers.

14
00:00:57,941 --> 00:00:59,909
Anyway, welcome to our home

15
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,440
KIKORIKI!

16
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:02,907
Safety, beauty...

17
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,478
friendship...we got it.

18
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:07,547
If you're looking for excitement,

19
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:10,481
purpose and chance to really shine

20
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:12,188
not our thing really.

21
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:13,912
Not that I'm complaining.

22
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,318
An old bird like me,

23
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:17,617
ah, who needs that stuff?

24
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:20,192
Okay, boys — cue the crescendo!

25
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:58,859
Wow, how romantic!

26
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:00,661
Could you imagine being here

27
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:03,907
with the love of your life someday?

28
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:10,103
Huh!? But well, I but ...

29
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:16,377
- Yes!
- No!

30
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,018
No!

31
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:23,991
- Krash! Please! Enough already.

32
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,093
- Krash!
- Here? Or here maybe?

33
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:28,695
Come on! Slow down!

34
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:34,865
Wait, I'm Serious.

35
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:38,164
Krash, I honestly I don't see
the point of this.

36
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:41,076
There!

37
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,801
The perfect spot!

38
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:45,515
We dig here.

39
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,844
Just think of it, Chiko.

40
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,851
Some future civilization
will dig up our box

41
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,251
in a hundred years, maybe a million.

42
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:55,548
Gimme that!

43
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:57,590
They'll learn about all our incredible
adventures and write amazing books about us.

44
00:02:57,828 --> 00:02:59,819
Maybe we'll be like Robin
Hood or Ali Baba for them.

45
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:02,828
Today. Krash saved Kikoriki from

46
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:04,329
the terrible Viking invasion.

47
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:06,093
What are you even talking about?

48
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,166
What Vikings?

49
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:08,394
It's just us here,

50
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,662
and we're all friends.

51
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:13,240
This is crazy, Krash.

52
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,871
You don't get what I'm saying.

53
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,603
It's not whether it's real that matters
— it's whether it's fun to read!

54
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:19,815
Oh right,

55
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,313
just lie about ourselves, c'mon!

56
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:24,179
The books they write about
us will be nonsense!

57
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:25,786
It's not hooey if it
gets them excited.

58
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:27,080
What do you want to write?

59
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:28,882
Krash ate a carrot today?

60
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,958
We wanna thrill em, not kill em.

61
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:33,253
If someone finds this box
someday and opens it,

62
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,658
it’ll be like they discovered
some amazing world

63
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:36,764
and then they will
want to go out

64
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:38,523
and actually do stuff

65
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,067
not just sit around

66
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:41,204
and think about doing something.

67
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:43,463
Krash, hold on, something's
wrong about this...

68
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,936
Nothing wrong about it!
Nothing wrong at all.

69
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:46,573
It's our duty to the
next generation.

70
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,142
Don’t you see, Chiko?

71
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:51,006
And if I end up looking
amazing along the way,

72
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:52,181
then I'll just have
to live with that.

73
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,908
No, Krash, something's wrong with
the sand.... AAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!

74
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,520
I'm thinking we can probably stop
digging now... AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!

75
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:09,794
- Chiko? Are you alive?
- I must be or it wouldn’t hurt so much.

76
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:22,440
- Where are we?
- I-I-I don't know,

77
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,343
but anyplace else would
definitely would be better...

78
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:29,583
Come on now, Chiko.

79
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,084
It's like Ali Baba's cave.

80
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:42,064
- Shh! Hear that?
- Ha'?

81
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:44,097
I heard a noise.

82
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:45,927
THERE!

83
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,432
Come on, let's check it out.

84
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:49,435
It'll be cool.

85
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:51,937
Yeah, you mean like the time
we checked out the beehive?

86
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:53,267
Oh wow,

87
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:09,015
it's like some kind of magic box.

88
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:12,262
How cool is this thing, huh?

89
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,861
I got dibs on this!

90
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:20,228
Fine it’s all yours.
Let’s go before somebody

91
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:33,847
- Holy Carrot... is that a...
- dinosaur.

92
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:40,315
Chiko, this is crazy!

93
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:42,389
How could all this stuff get here?

94
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,127
No one'll believe this

95
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:47,023
is it even for real?

96
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,528
One thing's for real,

97
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,701
I'm really scared...

98
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:05,511
"Tired of the same old burger?

99
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:07,080
Try a different old burger!"

100
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,117
"Here are some meaningless
lines and shapes..."

101
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:14,187
“I'm losing my mind

102
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:15,050
film at eleven!”

103
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,453
“Tired of the same old cereal?

104
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:17,716
Try a different old cereal...”

105
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,986
Goal goal GOOOAAALLL!!

106
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:26,696
Please Lord make me taller-

107
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:57,791
We have to get out of here!

108
00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:02,699
Okay - but we're takin'
this baby with us!

109
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:11,311
Don't drop it!

110
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:19,518
- Run this way!
- You mean like a scared idiot?

111
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:23,952
Don't let it go!

112
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:33,103
Rosa, I want to
say something here,

113
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:35,168
um, if, cuz...

114
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:36,371
Just lemme read this

115
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:47,112
Ahem, OK here goes...

116
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,977
I hope my words do not start to drift

117
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:55,421
As I stand here at the
edge of this cliff...

118
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:59,186
Ahem that's just a figure of speech,

119
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:00,293
not an actual...

120
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,124
Uh, I might be quiet like a sturgeon

121
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:04,561
But to open my heart

122
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:07,496
I sure don't need a surgeon.

123
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,364
I'm on the line, like a wet shirt

124
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,835
Preparing these words I am about to blurt

125
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,510
I shout these words

126
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,041
to the skies above

127
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,047
Rosa you are the one that I L—

128
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,957
Hold on, hey...

129
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:32,661
You'll never guess what we just did!

130
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:33,727
Maybe destroyed any

131
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:37,092
hope of ever being HAPPY
in this life!?!?

132
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,101
Point Dokko!

133
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,865
Come on?!

134
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,771
That birdie was out!

135
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:52,845
- This birdie says it was in.
- Hey everyone!

136
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,551
Look at what we found!

137
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,752
Here, here, careful,
down, down...

138
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,886
Perfect!

139
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,422
Maybe it's like,

140
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:03,625
an ice chest

141
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:06,093
Or a planter

142
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:08,228
A fish tank...or um...

143
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,833
Television.

144
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:14,169
Dokko! Hurry!

145
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:15,838
We're waiting here.

146
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:18,097
Sheesh, while we're young!

147
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:19,569
Whoops, too late.

148
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,543
Hold your horse feathers!
I need tools!

149
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:26,112
Let a master work!

150
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:29,317
- When I meet one, I'll be happy to.

151
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,020
So Carlin, you mean if this
television thing works,

152
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:34,121
we'll actually be able to see everything
that’s out there in the world?

153
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,085
Like everything

154
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,816
Castles and royal weddings
and faraway places?

155
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:40,119
That's what Dokko says!

156
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:43,229
I really hope so.
Because I mean, like,

157
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:44,797
I've read all of my
books so many times

158
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:46,934
and I'm sure this
television is going to

159
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,331
show me so many new things.

160
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:50,198
I just can't Walt to finally see

161
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,135
how the rest of the world lives.

162
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:56,611
This is really quite spectacular. Really
stellar. I read about television years ago,

163
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,473
but it was only a theory back then.

164
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:01,217
M-Hm...let's fix these loose hits...and...

165
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:03,977
Hey, stop pushing, let me
see, no fair pushing girls.

166
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:06,715
Quiet!

167
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:09,220
Oh, it's almost scary!

168
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:10,927
Please oh please oh please.

169
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:12,322
Voila!

170
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:21,729
<i>A I forgot!</i>

171
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,245
Back to the amazing adventures of Lucien!

172
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,448
When evil strikes our city again-

173
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:42,659
Lucien, Lucien!

174
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,860
When you're in trouble
you've got a friend--

175
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:47,790
Lucien, Lucien!

176
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:53,197
The bear in the blue mask - Lucien

177
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:58,669
Prepare for the blue mask - Lucien

178
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:06,907
Lucien! Lucien, Lucien!

179
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:09,777
Lucien, Lucien!

180
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,612
Lucien!

181
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:14,620
Haha, Lucien!

182
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:18,954
Wondering which shampoo gets my coat

183
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:21,357
so shiny —

184
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,929
You guessed it, Lucien!

185
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,161
On sale wherever shampoo

186
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:26,891
named after Lucien is sold!

187
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,803
<i>When you're head in 10 the mall,</i>

188
00:11:34,077 --> 00:11:36,341
you don't expect no trouble,

189
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:39,014
But you folks know as well as

190
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:40,944
I do that Doctor
Caligari and his thugs

191
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:43,413
never rest...

192
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:51,854
I got this.

193
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,462
Gotcha, tiger!

194
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:00,432
Lucien Diapers 20% Discount

195
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:01,593
With Lucien brand diapers

196
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:02,997
UR-ine luck!

197
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:05,230
Just try to get em too wet!

198
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:11,370
- Wow, he did it! Our hero!
- You scared the organs out of me

199
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:13,981
That Lucien is some kind of hero.

200
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,843
You gotta be —

201
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,109
ya think the let
just any bum on TV?

202
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:20,357
Doesn't look like Caligari
was involved this time...

203
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,580
Though who knows...

204
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,454
arson is right up his alley...

205
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:30,631
Looking for a little
PICK ME UP, super-zero?

206
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,198
HA! Mwa ha! My little trap worked!

207
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,402
Obliterate him!

208
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,651
Ugh! So unfair!

209
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:55,084
Why would anyone want to Kill
a dreamboat like Lucien?

210
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:59,626
- TAKE THAT!
- I, too, fall to sympathize with them.

211
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,127
He doesn't deserve it.

212
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,461
You said it!

213
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,363
'Adventure of Lucien”'

214
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:09,002
So concludes another chapter
in "The Life of Lucien"!

215
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:11,036
Shot on location, all day, every day!

216
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:12,867
No one can help you now, Lucien!

217
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:14,042
Lucien brand potato chips

218
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:15,767
put punch in your crunch!

219
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:19,380
- Take that, Caligari!
- Oh Lucien, how can we ever thank you?

220
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:21,947
Now back to more Lucien.

221
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:34,395
Lucien, I feel life
slipping away from me--

222
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:38,692
I'm telling you, Maria, really.
it’s my fault!

223
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:41,130
I was simply too late.

224
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:42,566
- You were fine.
- Totally wasn't.

225
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:43,499
- No, you were fine.
- No, I wasn't.

226
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,674
Let's just agree to disagree.

227
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,205
Lucien, I'm fish food at this point,

228
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:52,415
but you have a world to save.

229
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:56,674
Watch out for Caligari and his gang...

230
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,048
They're everywhere... everywhere...

231
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,758
Maria? Maria!

232
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:09,795
MARIIIIIIA!

233
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:23,813
Agh, I can't take it anymore!

234
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:25,310
Not another second!

235
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:28,984
Who knows how but Caligari's creeps have
infested the earth,

236
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:32,210
destroying decency,
annihilating the innocent.

237
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:37,385
Lucien's working his karate-chopping
hands to the bone to stop them.

238
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,459
And we just let him.

239
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:43,097
What are we,

240
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:44,663
but a bunch of mooching,

241
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:46,266
no-account,

242
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:47,662
lousy loafing sponging
siphoning users,

243
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:49,269
freeloading on the flesh

244
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:53,339
of the last decent creature on earth.

245
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:54,702
Well maybe you folks
can just sit there

246
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,436
and let him do all our dirty work,

247
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,850
but this is one bird that can't.

248
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:07,421
Wuh? huh?

249
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:11,554
This is terrible.

250
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:14,422
The guy's a saint. a saint.

251
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,463
Working his karate-chopping
hands to the bone

252
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,030
While this nasty Caligari
wipes us all out,

253
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:22,067
one by one. Like... like... like...

254
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:26,165
Mariiiiiia... aaaaa!

255
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:30,743
Well then what are
we doing here, guys?

256
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,008
Let's get on the stick!

257
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:37,082
Lucien needs us more then ever

258
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,687
let's ride!

259
00:15:43,493 --> 00:15:48,829
- We gotta find Lucien!
- What?

260
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:51,460
Dokko, where'd ya say the
signal is coming from?

261
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:58,469
Aa...iii... from across the sea!

262
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,474
Have you guys all
just lost your minds?

263
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:08,673
Okay let's get those gherkins stowed!
Chop chop, sailors!

264
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:09,315
Aye Aye, Mister Krash!

265
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,418
Gherkins, away!

266
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,815
Gherkins stowed!

267
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,256
- Swab the poop deck!
- Who named it the poop deck?

268
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,966
I believe it was that seagull flying over our heads.

269
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:25,835
Okay, this way with the TV!

270
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,695
Follow me!

271
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:32,335
There we go, this way! Come on, come on!

272
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,206
Now, just take it up the ladder.
Come on, what're ya waiting for!

273
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:40,145
Ah, Lucien Peanut Butter...

274
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,183
Great! So watch out, Caligari!

275
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,351
Dokko, stop goofing!

276
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,519
May contain nuts.

277
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,382
Just a bit more!

278
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:47,955
That's it, perfect.

279
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,316
It's a great honour for me
to be working with Lucian.

280
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:54,259
Lucian inspires us and teaches us
all to always be brave and honest.

281
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:57,831
I'm proud to know the only true
hero of this generation...

282
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:06,405
I for one respect your
decision to stay, Wally.

283
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:08,872
After all, there are those
of us who are called

284
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,943
to greatness. And there
are others of us

285
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:13,911
that are called to stay behind

286
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:16,208
and water the plants of those
that are called to greatness.

287
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,318
Do be a dear.

288
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:20,552
Rosa don't go!

289
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,258
You'll never make it out there!

290
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:24,619
Do you realize the ocean's almost
one hundred per cent water!

291
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,352
You'll drown! You'll get those
weird wrinkly fingertips!

292
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:37,531
Dear sweet Wally.

293
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:38,763
When you're fighting the good fight
the elements are on your side!

294
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,703
The wind! The sun!
We'll be fine!

295
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:46,575
Didn't you see three days ago how Lucien
crossed the ocean all by himself?

296
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,114
While wrestling robotic sharks!

297
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,481
You've all flipped your flapjacks!

298
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:55,615
And it's all this Lucien's fault!

299
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:57,655
I'll kill him, I'll kill him!
Die die diiiee!!!

300
00:17:57,893 --> 00:18:00,021
Yeeuughh...!

301
00:18:00,263 --> 00:18:03,631
Grab him, grab him! He's lost it!

302
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,358
It's just his nerves. Here —

303
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:07,467
Stay, boy.

304
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:08,898
Do your part proudly

305
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:11,232
there's a war to win, boy.

306
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:18,269
- And don't over water.
- Shove off, mates!

307
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:26,319
Bye Wal!

308
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,059
Bye, Rosa...

309
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,409
Lucien, don't leave!

310
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:51,648
- Why do you have to go?
- I'm sorry. 
 can’t. Justice calls.

311
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:57,376
- But when will we see you again?
- Maybe sometime down the line

312
00:18:57,653 --> 00:19:03,592
in, say, ten — twenty years...

313
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:08,161
Oh gimme a break here...
twenty years...

314
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:22,176
Rosa!!!!!!!

315
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:30,717
- Keep it down, I'm trying to sleep.

316
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:33,284
Wally... Wally...

317
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:34,853
Wally!?1?

318
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,526
Rosa I gotta tell you

319
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,062
I (gasp) gotta tell ya (choke) I lov—

320
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:50,602
Wally...drink up. A spot of
warm tea will set you right.

321
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,172
OW! So I just sat there
on the beach forever.

322
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,070
OW!

323
00:19:55,344 --> 00:19:59,713
I thought you definitely wouldn't
be gone for all that long.

324
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,975
OW! At the latest you'd come
to your senses by nighttime.

325
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:05,846
And when you didn't, I realized
you were right...

326
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:08,455
If something really matters
to you have to go after it,

327
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:10,192
even if it's totally crazy,

328
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:11,723
I mean totally crazy!

329
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:17,127
So I lit the lighthouse and here I am...
coming after...what matters most.

330
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,927
Welcome to Team Lucien!
That's the stuff, kid...

331
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:24,332
And THIS - makes it official!

332
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:26,541
I think blue's your color...

333
00:20:36,252 --> 00:20:39,085
Holy carrot...!

334
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:46,490
"Hey you wild things! Let's
get this party started!"

335
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:50,392
Ahoy! Avast! Shalom!
We need help!

336
00:20:50,633 --> 00:21:05,071
Hello!!! Yahoo, sailors! Hey! Hey come ONNNN! You've got room...!

337
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:08,443
Room, they got plenty —
hearing, not so much!

338
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,549
Who needs YOU?!

339
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:12,845
And you call that MUSIC?!

340
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:16,422
The forces of good are defeated once again!

341
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:19,321
Hal! Very soon...you will be destroyed

342
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:21,427
FOREVER!

343
00:21:35,478 --> 00:21:36,912
Look sharp sailors!

344
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:38,511
Rough seas ahead!

345
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:40,044
Gee, thanks for filling me in.

346
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:42,148
I was about to start a pedicure.

347
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,046
Olga, if we don't make it, you should know

348
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:49,087
your lunch tastes just as
delicious in both directions!

349
00:21:49,325 --> 00:21:50,918
Will you all stop with the jokes?!

350
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,652
It makes me nervous!

351
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:58,595
Oh, and these waves are
putting you to sleep?

352
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:00,962
So, where's this Lucien...?

353
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:03,831
What are we, chopped liver?!

354
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:15,878
- RO-SA! It's now or never!
- WHAT?

355
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:21,112
I just said "ROSA!
It's now or NEVERRR!"

356
00:22:22,658 --> 00:22:25,491
"Push down on the lever"?

357
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:29,062
NO! That's not what I'm

00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,121
Great Jolson's ghooooooooooooooost!!!

361
00:22:56,392 --> 00:22:58,588
Wet wool! Wet wool!

362
00:22:58,861 --> 00:23:02,491
- Batten down the hatches!
- Sadly [ failed hatch battening!

363
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:06,361
- Then man the rudder!
- We have a rudder?

364
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:15,938
Hey Krash?

365
00:23:19,949 --> 00:23:25,080
Guys, at my funeral, just make sure
I don't claaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaash!

366
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,877
...watch it, Valentino, no means no...

367
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:35,657
Holy carrot!

368
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,723
We made it!

369
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:43,591
Vappabaduba!

370
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:48,193
And I didn't have to row!

371
00:24:59,081 --> 00:24:59,741
Whaddaya know!

372
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:03,110
I can't believe we actually did it!

373
00:25:03,352 --> 00:25:05,787
Three cheers for US!

374
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:07,045
We did it, we dd it, we did it!

375
00:25:25,374 --> 00:25:27,138
Please hand over your papers - now!

376
00:25:27,376 --> 00:25:30,539
We need your IDs and all the
paperwork for your boat!

377
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,908
No can do! We don't have any!

378
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:35,480
Your point of departure?

379
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:39,985
- Far away! Across the seal
- To help out-the good guys!

380
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:43,055
And team up with the biggest
hero of them all...

381
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,556
Lucien!

382
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:54,866
- Find anything yet?
- No, boss.

383
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:57,732
Try Immigration.
What a pain in my caboose.

384
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,236
Yes Boss!

385
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,969
Now listen! I DEMAND to know why

386
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:04,145
we're being locked up like criminals!

387
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,350
- like criminals...
- Oh, I don't know...

388
00:26:09,618 --> 00:26:13,987
maybe it's because you have no...
No passports... no ID...

389
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:17,123
You've given us no CLUE as
to where you came from,

390
00:26:17,392 --> 00:26:20,418
what you want and what
diseases you're carrying!

391
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,926
- Which ones would you like?
- You're killing me. Ugh.

392
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,132
Just to keep an eye
on you clowns,

393
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:26,231
we'll be throwing you in quarantine...

394
00:26:26,468 --> 00:26:27,902
Quarantine my tushy feathers!

395
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:31,163
We know why you're really
covering your faces...

396
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:35,567
As if we can't tell by that sinister
glint in your beady little eyes!

397
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:37,108
Oh brother.

398
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:42,684
Those idiots think we're
too stupid to see that

399
00:26:42,918 --> 00:26:44,443
they 're working for Caligari.
Imbeciles!

400
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,849
But I've got a trained actor's eye!

401
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:51,149
I spotted them...the very
second I first saw them!

402
00:26:51,426 --> 00:26:54,919
Agreed! I've seen better acting
in a grade school pageant.

403
00:26:55,164 --> 00:26:55,995
We're gonna need

404
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:58,131
Lucian to bust us out of here!

405
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,631
Which means one of us will
have to sneak out somehow

406
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,166
and let him know our whereabouts...

407
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:05,429
But how do we decide...who goes?

408
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,488
Quick, quick, quick!
Before they come back!

409
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:28,820
Oh, isn’t that great... JUST when
I was beginning to like it here!

410
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:32,032
Wait...whose is that one?

411
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:37,470
Uh, um, not mine. Who's left? etc...

412
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:43,911
Chiko...

413
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:47,116
Chiko?!

414
00:27:51,720 --> 00:28:00,151
Far away, far from where you roam,

415
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:09,327
Far beyond the clouds,
there awaits your home.

416
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:18,343
Tied by a single thread

417
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:27,512
Stretching out from your door.

418
00:28:27,756 --> 00:28:35,789
In your home, there a
light burns bright.

419
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:39,830
Burning through the night,

420
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:45,336
burning out of sight.

421
00:28:45,574 --> 00:28:54,039
Tied by a single thread

422
00:28:54,283 --> 00:29:08,289
Stretching out from your door.

423
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:11,726
Always know, anywhere you roam,

424
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:16,427
You are never lost.

425
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,472
There's a way back home.

426
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:26,078
You are never lost.

427
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:34,848

428
00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:43,895

Stretching out from your door.

430
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:54,765
Excuse me, I can't find my friends.

431
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:59,140
Where’s the first place folks
go when they get here?

432
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,382
Blee blop um diddle, wait um, lemme think

The museum?

435
00:30:30,212 --> 00:30:34,843
Oh why dd I ever come on this trip?

436
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:43,454
Hey, you in ze fancy hat -

00:30:46,862 --> 00:30:49,388
- Got nowhere to go...
- Den go home, porcupine

439
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:52,361
Hedgehog. My home is far away.

440
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:56,128
Don't know if I'll ever see it again.

441
00:30:57,572 --> 00:31:00,064
You are cold, yah?

442
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:03,004
Maybe could use a strudel?

443
00:31:05,414 --> 00:31:07,610

Don't buy zee

geniuses in ziss town.

469
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,228
So I verk here.

470
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:06,593
Now off to Zlumberland, my pointy pal.

471
00:33:07,469 --> 00:33:09,164
But where are you gonna sleep?

472
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:13,500
Pah! Zleep is for weaklings
and zissypantses.

473
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,267
No offense, Porcupine.

474
00:33:15,544 --> 00:33:18,036
- Hedgehog.
- Vatever.

475
00:33:20,348 --> 00:33:25,787
Hope your big shot hero
friends find you tomorrow.

476
00:33:28,323 --> 00:33:32,317
You're a good man,
Pin, just like Lucien.

477
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:38,694
Maybe I'll wake up and
this'll all be a dream...

478
00:33:39,868 --> 00:33:52,179
And I'll be home with Krash, and
Olga and Rosa and Wally and...

479
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:16,531
Ever since Lucien began
fighting crime on his hit show,

480
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:19,206
a real life crime spree has plagued
our city and helped our ratings.

481
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:21,102
Today was no exception,

482
00:34:21,376 --> 00:34:24,471
as another robbery took place during
the afternoon broadcast of LUCIEN.

483
00:34:24,713 --> 00:34:26,238
Our field reporter exploits, I mean
explores their misery, shall we?

484
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:30,315
My mother gave me that jewelry.

485
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:31,746
Where were you, you dumb camel?

486
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:36,948
Watching the Lucien show,
like everyone else in town!

487
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:39,819
Next up, undercover weather
and tomorrow's cops.

488
00:34:40,061 --> 00:34:42,325
Wait — reverse that.

489
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:49,126
hee hee sure baby, I'll
give 'em the royal welcome.

490
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:50,897
Get up there!

491
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,300
Ow, my neck!

492
00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:55,202
They're coming — everyone act natural!

493
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:05,818
Oooookay kiddies — who's gonna
be big and brave for nursie?

494
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,620
Yesss! Woohoo!

495
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:13,317
That's the spirit!
Let's dance, feathers.

496
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,724
That's why I called,

497
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:20,731
What do you want first, the
good news or the bad news?

498
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:21,959
Or the pretty good news?

499
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,138
Okay, so bad news then good news
then some pretty good news?

500
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:29,037
Dead-end.

501
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:40,178
Oh, the good then
pretty good, then bad.

502
00:35:40,455 --> 00:35:42,116
Okay. Here's the good news. What?
Okay, then here's the bad news.

503
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:12,687
Watch it, wool-bag!

504
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:19,554
Uhuhuh... Lucien... Lucien!!!

505
00:36:19,828 --> 00:36:21,023

Century Tower...There!

508
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:31,036
All agents, we've got 624 in progress.
A lavender ram heading south on 3rd.

509
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,206
227 with a big 10-4 on the 624, Over.

510
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:44,750
Hey! Ram! Stop right there! Where
do you think you're going!

511
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,814
Hey, get a map, you crazy
foreigner doo-doo head!

512
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:53,083
Learn where you're going or beat it!

513
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:54,886
<i>-Out of the way!
-You with them?</i>

514
00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:03,800
If I were mayor I tel you! Agh!

515
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:08,576

00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:16,934
- What about his personal life?
- He grows potatoes.

529
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:18,043
Any debts?

530
00:38:18,313 --> 00:38:21,510
He bought a big house downtown
and still hasn't paid it off.

531
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:26,485
He's ours!

532
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:31,687
This is my show and I ain't
lettin' some farmer who

533
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,396
won a contest off a box
of cereal call the shots,

534
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,621
I don't care if it's
in his deal or not.

535
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:41,564
He's gonna do what I
say, and that's final.

536
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:44,100
Lucien!

537
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:45,465
I can't believe it! Lucieeeeen!

538
00:38:45,707 --> 00:38:48,369
Lucien!

539
00:38:49,177 --> 00:38:54,547
Lucien, save us, we need your help!

540
00:38:54,816 --> 00:39:00,255
Hang on, little feller —
there's trouble brewing.

541
00:39:00,722 --> 00:39:03,157
I've got your back.

542
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:06,759
What is this, the three little pigs?

543
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:10,726
Where's the set for Doctor
Caligari's secret lair?

544
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:13,627
I made a few tweaks.

545
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:17,498
I'm sick of these senseless fights,
shoot-outs, and socks in the kisser.

546
00:39:17,739 --> 00:39:20,333
Lucien's making the
show he want's to make.

547
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:23,670
A family show. Wholesome entertainment.

548
00:39:23,912 --> 00:39:26,438
Enough jumping around and running about
like a lunatic, for a man of my age.

549
00:39:26,714 --> 00:39:29,183
Ain't dignified.

550
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:30,543
Hal Jumping around and running?

551
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,776
The stunt men do all of that for you,

552
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:44,728
you useless old hack! This is our
world, hayseed. You just act in it.

553
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,799
Change the set back to Caligari's lair.

554
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:50,663
Anyone one does what this
loser says, they're fired!

555
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:54,205
Yeah, then good luck doing the
Lucien show without Lucien! I quit!

556
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:56,103
You quit when I say!

557
00:39:56,377 --> 00:40:00,336
I created Lucien the day
I found you on the farm.

558
00:40:00,582 --> 00:40:03,017
I only hired you
'cause you were cheap!

559
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:05,015
You shadow-creeper!

560
00:40:05,253 --> 00:40:06,743
You sun-fearing weasel!

561
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,150
Let the winds gather the
threatening clouds,

562
00:40:09,424 --> 00:40:13,224
and may the lightning
illuminate your errant ways!

563
00:40:13,461 --> 00:40:15,987
Good luck with your silly little show, pal.
I'm going home.

564
00:40:16,264 --> 00:40:17,425
Yeah? Going home?

565
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,327
I just have one question — WHAT home?

566
00:40:20,602 --> 00:40:26,063
We're selling your house. You should
have read your contract more carefully.

567
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:28,503
You've got nothing without us.

568
00:40:28,776 --> 00:40:32,269
No home, no car, no
savings, no pension!

569
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,539
Bupkis, bear! You owe so
much you'll be working

570
00:40:35,817 --> 00:40:38,582
for us until the big
hibernation in the sky.

571
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,914
You're through!

572
00:40:41,155 --> 00:40:42,623
You've got nothing,
nada...BUPKIS, bear!

573
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,225
You'll be paying it off for the
rest of your miserable life!

574
00:40:46,494 --> 00:40:51,591
<i>You'll never be free from
us, plow boy, never!</i>

575
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:57,533
You messed with the wrong rhino, you
fur covered bag of fertilizer...

576
00:40:57,805 --> 00:41:00,001
That's it! I win!

577
00:41:00,274 --> 00:41:01,764
AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT!

578
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:02,841
Okay, let's go! Time
is money, folks!

579
00:41:03,111 --> 00:41:04,135
<i>We've got dead air to fill</i>

580
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,575
Cue some music and get me a
replacement for this clown!

581
00:41:06,848 --> 00:41:10,478
- Anybody!
- Move it, people, you heard him!

582
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,154
- How "bout this guy?
- We're not that desperate!

583
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:17,051
- Then how about this one?
- Good enough.

584
00:41:17,325 --> 00:41:21,159
Get him onstage, disinfect him, and
get his lines up on the prompter.

585
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:24,366
Say hello, the sun is shining

586
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:27,624
Time to have some kooky fun.

587
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:30,861
Say goodbye to all
that whining, and sing

588
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:34,234
Stubi-dubi-dubi-dubum...

589
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:37,445
Say hello, the whole world loves you

590
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:40,705
you're one lucky son-of-a-gun.

591
00:41:40,982 --> 00:41:45,146
Stubidoobidoo! Wondering which
shampoo gets my coat so shiny?

592
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:47,753
You guessed it... Julien!

593
00:41:48,022 --> 00:41:50,889
Problems drop just like flies

594
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,752
When you just shut your eyes, and sing

595
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:55,019
Stubidu-dubidu

596
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,231
Stubi-dubi-dubi-dubum...

597
00:41:57,498 --> 00:42:00,263
Why don't we try that kid
who was babbling on and

598
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:03,095
on about winds and storms
to read the weather

599
00:42:03,337 --> 00:42:04,805
He didn't sound half bad!

600
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:10,000
Besides that... Bet
he works for peanuts!

601
00:42:10,511 --> 00:42:13,481
Say hello, adventure's calling

602
00:42:13,715 --> 00:42:15,649
A brand new life has just begun

603
00:42:15,883 --> 00:42:19,877
Hold on, wait! Hero crossing!

604
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,420
Thank you very much...

605
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:26,717
But if-if-if you find it
all appalling, just sing

606
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,931
Say hello, the doors wide open

607
00:42:30,198 --> 00:42:32,565
If you're ever havin' trouble copin', sing

608
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,101
Stubi-dubi-dubi-dubum...

609
00:42:39,907 --> 00:42:44,367
- I have a little proposal for you.
- Talk to the hoof!

610
00:42:45,947 --> 00:42:49,315
Lucien!

611
00:42:50,118 --> 00:42:50,983
What the??

612
00:42:51,252 --> 00:42:54,187
I don't care WHO he is,
you're in my parking spot!

613
00:42:54,422 --> 00:42:59,417
- So out of the way— before I call a...
- What are we waiting for?

614
00:43:00,061 --> 00:43:03,395
So sorry! You mean THAT Lucien.

615
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:08,262
I love this guy! There's no one
that that I love more than Lucien!

616
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,870
Let me help you...

617
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:12,231
...with your bag, sir...

618
00:43:12,473 --> 00:43:14,737
you know I only eat YOUR tuna fish.

619
00:43:17,578 --> 00:43:19,410
Wow... Lucien...
Autograph?

620
00:43:19,647 --> 00:43:23,413
Make it to Shchafuhgahughlemaka.

621
00:43:23,651 --> 00:43:26,416
They said they were part of your team.

622
00:43:26,654 --> 00:43:31,421
Just sign here, and we'll
take care of the rest.

623
00:43:34,295 --> 00:43:37,731
- Lucien! Holy carrot!
- Where have you been?

624
00:43:37,965 --> 00:43:40,127
- We knew you'd come!
- We're so happy to see you! It's you!

625
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:48,071
Lucien!

626
00:44:05,827 --> 00:44:07,454
Yall's are who?

627
00:44:07,695 --> 00:44:09,959
Lucien's Team Invincible!

628
00:44:10,198 --> 00:44:12,189
Hip, hooray!

629
00:44:12,466 --> 00:44:17,165
Lucien? There's no more Lucien.

630
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:21,205
-What? What do you mean?
-What's he talking about?

631
00:44:21,475 --> 00:44:22,806
I'm so confused...

632
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:26,014
What the heck should we call you then?

633
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,914
You shouldn't.

634
00:45:02,383 --> 00:45:04,477
Stand clear of the closing doors.

635
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,178
Next stop: Igorville

636
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:25,066
Alright, I give up!

637
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,775
What do you nut jobs want from me?!

638
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:30,841
We came from far away to be
with you to defeat Caligari!

639
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:33,342
- And his minions!

640
00:45:33,581 --> 00:45:35,777
The world is in peril!

641
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:38,519
Look! The fan club's closed, folks!

642
00:45:38,753 --> 00:45:41,051
Ditch the masks and go home.

643
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:44,657
No autographs, no nothin'.

644
00:45:44,926 --> 00:45:45,859
Am I making myself clear?

645
00:45:46,093 --> 00:45:49,461
Now please leave me alone!
I've got a lot on my mind!

646
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:55,100
But sir, we came to fight!

647
00:45:56,137 --> 00:45:58,606
wait a darn second

648
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,104
so you want us to fight EVIL together?

649
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,937
I see, you're not fans...

650
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,114
You're! A bunch of! Nutjobs!

651
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,818
I got NO energy for this.

652
00:46:11,085 --> 00:46:13,349
- Go back to Kookoo-Ville, kids.
- Lucien! Wait!

653
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:15,419
Listen, get it together, team.

654
00:46:15,656 --> 00:46:18,853
Just go with the flow. Don't
you get what's happening here?

655
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:23,222
You think he lets any bunch
of bananas fight with him?

656
00:46:23,464 --> 00:46:25,831
He's really TESTING us, d'ya get it?

657
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,535
Caligari's spies are watching everything.

658
00:46:28,769 --> 00:46:30,897
We gotta split up, fan out

659
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:33,800
It's time to go undercover.

660
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,736
And now, the moment you've

661
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:37,136
all been waiting for!

662
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,506
The terrifying leap into the abyss!

663
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:49,315
Featuring the once great star of the screen
- Lucien!

664
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,083
Go on, jump already
if you're gonna jump!

665
00:46:57,164 --> 00:47:00,361
Psst, hey Lucien! Agent
Krash here, remember?

666
00:47:00,634 --> 00:47:02,124
Agent Krash?

667
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,235
Oh, It's you.

668
00:47:03,504 --> 00:47:05,495
Did you find your hedgehog
friend or whatever?

669
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,004
Haven't stopped looking -
that's what friends do.

670
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,437
I've searched the town
with a fine-toothed comb.

671
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:11,075
Maybe I needed a hairbrush.

672
00:47:11,345 --> 00:47:16,112
Wonder if he's undercover,
like us...heard anything?

673
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,114
Nah.

674
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:19,743
Niiice!

675
00:47:20,021 --> 00:47:24,356
That's a tough dive.

676
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,617
Let's hear it for Lucien!

677
00:47:26,894 --> 00:47:29,886
He'll be signing autographs for
anyone with cash who still cares.

678
00:47:30,164 --> 00:47:32,292
Stick around, next leap in 10 minutes!

679
00:47:32,533 --> 00:47:34,399
And...done! There!

680
00:47:34,668 --> 00:47:36,500
Museum

681
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,407
Eez it possible zat you missed zem?

682
00:47:49,216 --> 00:47:52,550
No. Nobody came today either.

683
00:47:52,787 --> 00:48:09,330
Ach, maybe tomorrow, Porcupine.

684
00:48:15,242 --> 00:48:17,233
It's the television
event of the century!

685
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,446
Even huger than last week's
television event of the century.

686
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:24,412
Meet this generation's only
true hero - the amazing Julien!

687
00:48:32,226 --> 00:48:34,092
Holy cannoli!

688
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,854
Look at these babies over here, Joey!

689
00:48:37,131 --> 00:48:41,295
Can it, numb-nut! What kind
of mutton-head are you?

690
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,547
Krash! Carlin! Is that you?

691
00:48:57,785 --> 00:48:59,412
You came for me?

692
00:49:03,824 --> 00:49:05,519
- Oh, hello.
- H-hello...

693
00:49:05,793 --> 00:49:10,731
Hey. How's it going?

694
00:49:11,132 --> 00:49:12,725
Who are you?

695
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:16,164
Depends — uh, who are you?

696
00:49:16,437 --> 00:49:18,701
Well, I'm nobody, really.

697
00:49:18,939 --> 00:49:20,236
During the day I wait
around for my friends,

698
00:49:20,474 --> 00:49:22,238
and at night, Pin lets
me sleep over here,

699
00:49:22,476 --> 00:49:24,570
He's the guard. Oops!

700
00:49:24,812 --> 00:49:26,405
Don't spread that around

701
00:49:26,647 --> 00:49:28,775
he could get in trouble
for letting me stay.

702
00:49:29,016 --> 00:49:34,284
No, heh heh your secret's
safe with us, little fella.

703
00:49:34,522 --> 00:49:38,459
- Thanks. So you guys work nights eh?
- Uh...matter of fact, we do.

704
00:49:38,692 --> 00:49:41,127
Ahhhh! You get everything polished
while the place is closed.

705
00:49:41,362 --> 00:49:45,128
- Yeah, we're polishers.
- Why don't you take these ones?

706
00:49:45,366 --> 00:49:48,392
What, you think we're idiots here?

707
00:49:48,669 --> 00:49:49,659
Those cases are wired, dude.

708
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,271
Oh! No problem, guys.

709
00:50:01,182 --> 00:50:03,674
Yeah, give us a hand
and we can clean out,

710
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,909
I mean clean up the whole joint.

711
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:13,382
Well, it was areal
pleasure meeting you.

712
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,563
Yeah, let us know if you end up
sleeping over, say, at the bank.

713
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:19,959
They got a safe there we really
been meaning to clean out, too.

714
00:50:20,201 --> 00:50:24,229
See ya in the funny papers!

715
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:30,434
- Adios!
- Bye now! 'Night!

716
00:50:42,089 --> 00:50:44,421
Go! Go! Go! MOVE IT!

717
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,393
Holy Schnitzel!

718
00:50:49,897 --> 00:50:51,592
Charlie 1, to Charlie 2.

719
00:50:51,865 --> 00:50:53,833
I have the two suspects in my sights!
Moving in!

720
00:50:54,068 --> 00:50:58,369
Chiko? Vy dit you open zee door?

721
00:50:59,206 --> 00:51:00,469
You're surrounded!

722
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:02,073
Resistance is futile!

723
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,300
Put your paws and flippers in the air,

724
00:51:04,578 --> 00:51:05,670
or we open fire.

725
00:51:05,913 --> 00:51:08,382
Do it!

726
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:12,746
Okay, er, let's give it a shot

727
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:16,287
Ahem, “for today's forecast we're um,
looking at lots of sunshine

728
00:51:16,557 --> 00:51:19,322
“point to swirly stuff and big
line of triangles over shoulder”

729
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,154
moving West Northwest.”

730
00:51:22,396 --> 00:51:24,330
That's fine you're fine, you're fine

731
00:51:24,565 --> 00:51:27,398
everything's fine!

732
00:51:27,635 --> 00:51:27,999
It's all good.

733
00:51:28,269 --> 00:51:31,637
Where's that new kid! Three minutes to air!

734
00:51:31,905 --> 00:51:36,206
I'm here! Over here! COMING!!

735
00:51:45,286 --> 00:51:47,220
Hee hee hee!!! Can you
believe that little moron?

736
00:51:47,454 --> 00:51:49,149
I thought you had bathwater
for brains but that guy!

737
00:51:49,423 --> 00:51:52,916
Bathwater!

738
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:58,458
Hee hee! We're in the do-dee-o-do.
dooot doot da doo dah...

739
00:52:01,935 --> 00:52:02,561
Hello?

740
00:52:02,803 --> 00:52:04,897
Agent Rosa!
It's Agent Wally.

741
00:52:05,139 --> 00:52:10,805
I need you to turn on the TV and check
out the weather report, right away!

742
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,108
Okay...

743
00:52:22,189 --> 00:52:23,657
Good morning, Wally.

744
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:26,155
Today, were uh looking at lots of sunshine

745
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,328
with a bunch of clouds in the
approaching high pressure system.

746
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,328
The wind is windy, and the
ocean is exceedingly wet,

747
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,228
And even though there is a threat
of a storm coming in from the sea,

748
00:52:35,502 --> 00:52:37,436
it will never stop me from telling you,

749
00:52:37,671 --> 00:52:40,663
Rosa, what I've been wanting
to say to you for so long.

750
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,876
Rosa, I wanted to... Rosa,
I wanted to tell you that

751
00:52:43,143 --> 00:52:46,135
for a really long time now,

752
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:51,409
I... I... you... I...

753
00:52:51,685 --> 00:52:53,551
Wally! We found Chiko! Let’s go!

754
00:53:04,531 --> 00:53:07,728
We found him!

755
00:53:08,001 --> 00:53:13,303
- That's him!
- What is it? What's going on?

756
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,907
We found Chiko!

757
00:53:16,343 --> 00:53:17,833
A major robbery was
stopped in progress—

758
00:53:18,078 --> 00:53:18,510
Now the city can sleep
knowing— These criminal

759
00:53:18,746 --> 00:53:19,212
masterminds, who have terrorized
the city are at last—

760
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:24,543
The getaway car has
not yet been found.

761
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,254
Would you care to comment
on these events?

762
00:53:27,521 --> 00:53:31,014
Outrageous! They deserve life!

763
00:53:31,258 --> 00:53:33,192
The verdict will be announced today.

764
00:53:33,427 --> 00:53:38,422
You have been found guilty and
sentenced to life in prison!

765
00:54:07,227 --> 00:54:13,690
Oh... oh please...

766
00:54:14,468 --> 00:54:18,905
What do you freaks WANT!!!!

767
00:54:28,982 --> 00:54:31,007
So what do you want me to do about it?

768
00:54:31,285 --> 00:54:33,754
You want me to blow up
the cockamamie jail?

769
00:54:33,987 --> 00:54:37,184
Oh, well, yes, thank you — Jolly good!

770
00:54:37,458 --> 00:54:40,450
You're out of your coconuts.

771
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,527
Look, I've got enough
idiots trying to force

772
00:54:43,797 --> 00:54:46,596
me do stuff without you
nut-bars joining in.

773
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:50,600
Now can you please leave
nicely, or do I have

774
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:54,468
to call the chuckle squad
to haul you away?!

775
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:59,077
But Lucien, we came all the way from across
the sea to help YOU in your mission.

776
00:54:59,346 --> 00:55:03,943
Which got our friend put in jail!
Don't you care?

777
00:55:04,184 --> 00:55:06,380
It's a Caligari plot, obviously!

778
00:55:06,653 --> 00:55:09,679
When he heard we're all working together
he decided he had to break us up,

779
00:55:09,957 --> 00:55:11,891
so he framed Chiko for a robbery.

780
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:15,288
Now don't you see that you've
got to help us all out?

781
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:19,363
Caligari is a made-up character!

782
00:55:19,633 --> 00:55:22,295
Just the same as Lucien is

783
00:55:22,536 --> 00:55:24,163
My real name is—
—Barry!

784
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:27,396
Fine, you're not nuts,
you're from far away.

785
00:55:27,674 --> 00:55:30,666
You gambled everything to
come here and got ripped off.

786
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,106
WELL JOIN THE CLUB!

787
00:55:32,379 --> 00:55:34,313
I wish I never left the farm!

788
00:55:34,548 --> 00:55:36,016
I came to be a great actor...

789
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,014
and instead I'm selling shampoo!

790
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,448
So we both got robbed here.

791
00:55:40,721 --> 00:55:44,055
Sometimes you aim for the sky
and get kicked in the can!

792
00:55:44,324 --> 00:55:47,624
Tough! You clowns are NOT my problem!

793
00:55:47,861 --> 00:55:51,798
Uh...Sounds like you're on the fence.
Take your time! We'll wait.

794
00:55:52,032 --> 00:55:56,060
Seems he's coming around though!

795
00:56:01,742 --> 00:56:05,679
Hey guys...? Just, please,
listen to me closely.

796
00:56:05,913 --> 00:56:10,783
He's not gonna be “coming around”...
Okay? No really.

797
00:56:11,051 --> 00:56:15,716
He's not...responsible for us...
He's just an actor...

798
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:19,483
and he's just playing a part...
It's not real-life...

799
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,455
It's like...theatre.

800
00:56:21,728 --> 00:56:26,495
Like theater? It's just...pretend?

801
00:56:26,733 --> 00:56:29,430
Make-believe and that's all?

802
00:56:29,703 --> 00:56:37,008
- So, there's no Lucien? Nowhere?
- No one's swooping in to rescue us?

803
00:56:37,377 --> 00:56:39,311
No one.

804
00:56:48,055 --> 00:56:54,825
- Guys, come on. Let's go.
- See ya...

805
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,666
Thanks for getting
through to them for me.

806
00:57:02,936 --> 00:57:05,871
Get away from me.

807
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:31,025
Here. Sorry we couldn't find any
gold-plated Egyptian dishes for you...

808
00:57:31,298 --> 00:57:36,236
But we DID mange to find
you some ancient food!

809
00:57:45,345 --> 00:57:48,781
Hey Chuck, do these new uniforms
make me look fat, or what?

810
00:57:49,016 --> 00:57:52,816
- No, you look great!
- Yeah, but good-great, or great-great?

811
00:57:53,353 --> 00:57:58,655
- Okay, team, Chiko's in there somewhere!
- Thanks for narrowing that down for us...

812
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:02,055
The first thing we do is get over this
high voltage electric fence... I think

813
00:58:02,329 --> 00:58:07,267
Great! I'm right behind you!
And then what? Huh?

814
00:58:07,501 --> 00:58:12,268
That, my friends, is the question.

815
00:58:12,506 --> 00:58:16,807
Tell me. Have any of you folks
ever heard of the word...PLAN?

816
00:58:17,044 --> 00:58:18,341
Of course we've got a plan!

817
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,740
Everyone knows you have to
have some kind of plan.

818
00:58:21,014 --> 00:58:23,711
Colin, tell him the plan...
Tell him what the plan is, hm?

819
00:58:23,984 --> 00:58:28,080
What? Me? PLAN?! What do I
look like, Planny McPlan?!

820
00:58:28,321 --> 00:58:30,813
Maybe we can buy a plan...

821
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:38,025
There IS one shady character...who
just might be able to help!

822
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:59,542
I always did love this view.

823
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:04,314
How about... a heads-up before you
decide to drop in and scare me to death?

824
00:59:04,591 --> 00:59:10,121
You know what a nervous
nellykins I am.

825
00:59:10,397 --> 00:59:13,025
Look, Barry... I'll tell you
what I found on this “Chiko”.

826
00:59:13,266 --> 00:59:14,734
Then I'm going back to bed.

827
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:18,905
He and that other guy are in cell
block 47 at the State Penitentiary.

828
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:21,972
There's a chance he'll be declared
incompetent for insanity—

829
00:59:22,242 --> 00:59:24,370
You should hear the
dribble he's spewing:

830
00:59:24,611 --> 00:59:25,078
Good, evil, peace, friends, Lucien,

831
00:59:25,078 --> 00:59:30,039
Caligari, dinosaurs wearing slippers...

832
00:59:30,283 --> 00:59:32,479
That screwball—one
of a kind, for sure.

833
00:59:32,753 --> 00:59:37,247
There are six more right
outside your door. Humor me.

834
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:42,095
Caligari! It's a trap!

835
00:59:42,095 --> 00:59:48,762
Ahh! Caligari!

836
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:54,171
Seriously, Barry!? This is your team?

837
00:59:54,441 --> 00:59:58,611
I can't do it... — this is not some scripted
TV show -

838
00:59:58,612 --> 01:00:01,411
it's a real prison break-out.

839
01:00:01,648 --> 01:00:03,082
This is suicide!

840
01:00:03,316 --> 01:00:06,980
C'mon, Eugene, you're the
master of ingenious plans.

841
01:00:07,254 --> 01:00:09,279
I know, you're probably
thinkin' that when Old

842
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,491
Barry lost his job he
went off the deep end.

843
01:00:11,758 --> 01:00:13,749
But it's not about that, Eugene.

844
01:00:13,994 --> 01:00:15,628
These guys need us for real.

845
01:00:15,629 --> 01:00:16,027
For once we could say we did
something

846
01:00:16,263 --> 01:00:21,895
that actually mattered.

847
01:00:22,135 --> 01:00:26,663
What do you say, old friend?

848
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:32,071
OK, here's the floor plan, the sewage
system, the security guards' schedule...

849
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,905
Quiet!

850
01:00:35,182 --> 01:00:37,674
Anyone know electricity?

851
01:00:37,951 --> 01:00:39,942
Uh, just basics...

852
01:00:40,187 --> 01:00:42,622
You're on alarm systems.
Don't mess it up!

853
01:00:42,856 --> 01:00:44,517
Listen up, geniuses.

854
01:00:44,791 --> 01:00:47,624
There's not one part of this plan
that's unimportant, not a one!

855
01:00:47,861 --> 01:00:49,662
You must commit every single

856
01:00:49,663 --> 01:00:52,223
step of it to memory —

857
01:00:52,465 --> 01:00:57,460
<i>... 'til you know it in your sleep!
One misstep and you're all goners!</i>

858
01:00:57,704 --> 01:01:01,004
I've made a thousand cunning
plans in my career, and

859
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:04,176
every one of them, RUINED!
By a stupid mistake.

860
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:06,179
Uh uh...that and the fact

861
01:01:06,179 --> 01:01:07,442
that you always stop to chit chat

862
01:01:07,681 --> 01:01:10,707
before pushing the big red button!

863
01:01:10,984 --> 01:01:12,418
Enough with the wisecracks!

864
01:01:12,652 --> 01:01:14,620
Let's move on. ON to the weather!

865
01:01:14,855 --> 01:01:17,017
What's up the for cast?
You with the horns.

866
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,783
I regret that it's looking
very stormy! Sir.

867
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:23,196
That's perfect. Most
important,

868
01:01:23,196 --> 01:01:26,860
cool heads... Yeah.

869
01:01:35,909 --> 01:01:38,537
Yagh! Woman, we're not
even being chased yet!

870
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,212
- Who gave you your license?

871
01:01:40,213 --> 01:01:42,341
- What's a license?

872
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:46,783
Ugh - Pull up ahead at the station.

873
01:01:47,053 --> 01:01:48,543
I'll wait for you there. Not to worry.

874
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:52,156
I bought you tickets for
the last train out.

875
01:01:52,425 --> 01:01:53,586
The nine-fifteen.,

876
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,954
Hit the breaks, hit the breaks!

877
01:01:56,196 --> 01:01:57,230
- Miss that train and you're on your own.

878
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:00,860
- Thanks, buddy.

879
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,735
What-what the devil are you wearing?!

880
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,837
I said black, nothing but black!!

881
01:02:07,374 --> 01:02:09,741
But only bad guys wear black...

882
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:13,746
Wha - but - eugh!

883
01:02:13,747 --> 01:02:14,612
Come on, it'll be fine!

884
01:02:14,881 --> 01:02:16,815
Or not!

885
01:02:27,093 --> 01:02:28,754
Lets do this...

886
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,763
Oh, buddy your life was looking

887
01:02:30,764 --> 01:02:33,529
like you'd ride into the sunset.

888
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:36,964
Everything was easy as pie.

889
01:02:37,237 --> 01:02:43,665
So quiet, so peaceful, so mellow.

890
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:47,780
And now your starring in

891
01:02:47,781 --> 01:02:52,281
someone else's movie.

892
01:06:28,868 --> 01:06:31,565
The wiring diagram used
completely different colors.

893
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:37,299
We're 20 seconds behind...

894
01:06:37,544 --> 01:06:43,415
I'll cut this one, and the
red one too, just in case.

895
01:06:54,727 --> 01:06:58,357
Chico...

896
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:01,034
Warden, I'm worried I

897
01:07:01,034 --> 01:07:03,867
left my iron on at home!

898
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,071
Hey warden, warden, where you going?

899
01:07:06,339 --> 01:07:08,603
- Chiko! Chikooo!
- Krash?

900
01:07:08,841 --> 01:07:09,933
I can't believe it!

901
01:07:10,176 --> 01:07:12,201
We've been looking all over for you!

902
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,708
I've been looking for you too!

903
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,608
I missed you so much!

904
01:07:15,882 --> 01:07:17,043
Hello! Looks like fun!

905
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,050
Let’s have a pillow

906
01:07:18,051 --> 01:07:19,541

907
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,311
Lucien...

908
01:07:21,588 --> 01:07:24,888
It's you... I KNEW you'd
come and save us!

909
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:27,821
I knew it. ..

910
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,567
Ladies and Gentlemen: The train

911
01:07:34,567 --> 01:07:36,467
scheduled to leave in five minutes

912
01:07:36,703 --> 01:07:39,001
is actually leaving in five minutes.

913
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:42,334
We sincerely apologize
for any confusion.

914
01:07:42,575 --> 01:07:47,240
- Look, Ma! It's Dr. Cali-gari!
- Right, and I'm Jab-ba the Hut...

915
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,142
- Yeah that's what dad calls you.
- I'll kill him,

916
01:07:50,416 --> 01:07:51,583
Annnnd NOW! The moment

917
01:07:51,584 --> 01:07:51,880
you've all been waiting for!

918
01:07:52,118 --> 01:07:56,282
Presenting...the only
real hero of our times —

919
01:07:56,556 --> 01:07:59,582
It's the Ju-lien SHOOOOW!

920
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,624
Hurry up!

921
01:08:02,895 --> 01:08:06,559
- Uh...but... You forgot Pin!
- What's a Pin?

922
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,600
- He's in there...

923
01:08:08,601 --> 01:08:09,397
- No you don't, kid!

924
01:08:09,636 --> 01:08:11,001
We're sticking to the plan!

925
01:08:11,271 --> 01:08:12,864
He's on his OWN!

926
01:08:13,106 --> 01:08:16,132
I"m not going anywhere without Pin!

927
01:08:16,643 --> 01:08:19,305
I am so in love with you...you—

928
01:08:19,579 --> 01:08:21,172
Oh, forget it!

929
01:08:21,414 --> 01:08:22,609
OPEN it!

930
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:25,117
But we don't have the keys

931
01:08:25,118 --> 01:08:25,607
to these cells!

932
01:08:26,252 --> 01:08:29,586
Oh all right, episode
three hundred sixty-five.

933
01:08:29,822 --> 01:08:32,484
It's th Case of the Loose Tooth!
AC-TION!

934
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:35,592
Get that rope tied to the cell door!

01:08:40,099 --> 01:08:42,134

my (ON/OFF) WAAAY!

Hey, whoa! Vat in zee world

01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:16,168
Talk with your feet, flappy!

942
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,936
You'd better move it or lose it!

943
01:09:19,205 --> 01:09:21,970
Just pretend you're having
a bad dream and relax...!

944
01:09:29,182 --> 01:09:31,116
Agh, my sciatica...

945
01:09:31,351 --> 01:09:32,685
Where—are—those—guys?!

946
01:09:35,488 --> 01:09:37,286
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

947
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,626

01:09:42,895 --> 01:09:44,886
Hey! Over here, you! Hurry up!

949
01:09:45,398 --> 01:09:47,196

01:09:47,533 --> 01:09:48,500
Bingo!

951
01:10:18,431 --> 01:10:20,058
Come on!

952
01:10:27,407 --> 01:10:28,374
Come on, Chiko, come on!

953
01:10:28,608 --> 01:10:30,940
Gimme your paws!

954
01:10:35,448 --> 01:10:38,884
It’s a dream. It's just a DREAM!
I'm dreaming, that’s all...

955
01:10:39,118 --> 01:10:40,252
Lullaby

956
01:10:40,253 --> 01:10:44,554
and good night, go
to zleep leetle penguin,

957
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:58,032
Oh, good.

958
01:10:58,271 --> 01:11:04,267
At least we have...power

959
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:38,371
It worked!

960
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:51,714
Hm, I don’t sink zat vas "off"!!

961
01:12:05,338 --> 01:12:06,203
No...no...NOO!!

962
01:12:06,472 --> 01:12:07,667
All right!

963
01:12:16,649 --> 01:12:19,983
Were you taking a nap?!

964
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:28,258
It's all clear! C'mon!

965
01:12:28,528 --> 01:12:34,695
Hey, wait! Where are the...

966
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:37,960
Crazy Al on the Crazy Eights with
some crrrrrazy weather news!

967
01:12:38,237 --> 01:12:38,370
"Dude,

968
01:12:38,371 --> 01:12:39,839
 where's my blimp?"

969
01:12:40,072 --> 01:12:44,600
Seems that storm has knocked our WJUL Eye
in the Sky blimp loose and it's outta here!

970
01:12:44,877 --> 01:12:52,375
First caller to spot it wins a year's
supply of Julian Teeth Whitener!
Oh the insanity on the new Julian FM.
Now, back to our show!

971
01:12:53,386 --> 01:12:55,388
Wondering which shampoo

972
01:12:55,388 --> 01:12:56,685
gets my coat so shiny?

973
01:12:56,923 --> 01:12:59,756
You guessed it... Julien!

974
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:08,399
Julien! Sign my face!
Sign my baby's face!

975
01:13:09,368 --> 01:13:12,404
Sol After this
commercial...

976
01:13:12,405 --> 01:13:14,305
go to scene 18.

977
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:17,340
Now back to our show...the

978
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:21,274
amazing adventures of...
Julien!

979
01:13:21,547 --> 01:13:26,542
Sorry, you're fine, you're fine!

980
01:13:26,786 --> 01:13:29,084
Everything's fine...It's all good.

981
01:13:29,422 --> 01:13:33,017
Has anyone seen the new kid?
Tell him, three minutes to air!

982
01:13:33,259 --> 01:13:35,853
I'm here, over here. Coming!

983
01:13:36,095 --> 01:13:37,187
Can you believe
that little moron?

984
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:38,591
I thought you had
bathwater for brains,

985
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:42,165
- but that guy!
- Hah! Bathwater!

986
01:13:42,435 --> 01:13:45,598
Hah! Bathwater!

987
01:13:45,938 --> 01:13:48,236
What do you think you're
do-ing, coming here?!

988
01:13:48,474 --> 01:13:52,104
How many times do I have to tell you
don't bring the loot to the studio!

989
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,780
Are you trying to get me
put away or something?!

990
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:56,539
But boss, you won't believe it!

991
01:13:56,816 --> 01:13:59,148
Its like Christmas in July!

992
01:13:59,418 --> 01:14:01,409
Yeah, there was some
four-eyes nerd there!

993
01:14:01,654 --> 01:14:02,955
He handed it
right over to us!!

994
01:14:03,589 --> 01:14:05,284
Will you look at all of this stuff!

995
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:09,961
You know, I never thought I’d say
this, but you idiots are geniuses!

996
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:13,530
Boss, you just keep everyone
staring at that idiot box,

997
01:14:13,799 --> 01:14:17,963
and we'll keep stealing their stuff
from right under their noses!

998
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,195
- That's right, that’s right!
Boo. Boo. What a crock,

999
01:14:20,473 --> 01:14:22,407
what a lowlife! Lock him up!
Throw away the key!

1000
01:14:23,476 --> 01:14:28,243
Test pattern! Bring up
the TEST PATTERNNN!!

1001
01:14:33,853 --> 01:14:38,848
Stu-bee-doobee-doobee...beedoh!

1002
01:14:39,825 --> 01:14:43,625
- There's only one harness left!
- We didn't count on the penguin!

1003
01:14:43,863 --> 01:14:46,230
Get outta here..

1004
01:14:46,499 --> 01:14:50,834
- But...
- C'mon, hurry up!

1005
01:14:58,844 --> 01:15:02,007
- Woah something's wrong!
- The rope is caught on a blimp!

1006
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:03,738
WAS caught on a b—OOFF!

1007
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,389
This'un's for real, boy.

1008
01:15:45,357 --> 01:15:47,621
Woaoaoaoaoaoaohhhh!!!

1009
01:15:54,967 --> 01:16:00,599
- Lucien!
- Barry! You can...

1010
01:16:04,777 --> 01:16:06,905
Agh! Come on!

1011
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:11,640
- Faster, Olga! Don’t lose him!
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

1012
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,374
Agh! Left! Turn left!

1013
01:16:41,647 --> 01:16:45,743
-Come on, turn left!
-Turn left!

1014
01:16:45,985 --> 01:16:47,146
Which is my left, my stirring
hand or my writing hand?

1015
01:16:47,419 --> 01:16:53,916
That's how I remember —
stirring or writing.

1016
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,959
- When you're driving?
- No, when I'm cooking!

1017
01:16:57,196 --> 01:17:00,791
- We're not cooking!
- Right, we're dying!

1018
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:02,967
Lemme out...

1019
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:07,230
- Pull me in, PULL ME IN!!
- Gotcha!

1020
01:17:27,827 --> 01:17:30,296
Go! Everyone into the blimp, NOW!

1021
01:17:30,529 --> 01:17:33,897
Let's move it, folks! Pedal to the metal!

1022
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:38,433
Chiko! You're almost home free,
buddy, so feel the burn!?

1023
01:17:38,671 --> 01:17:40,332
We got everyone?

1024
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:43,372
Uh, not quite!

1025
01:17:58,557 --> 01:18:01,527
Hey weatherman.

1026
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,253
You're not off the air yet.

1027
01:18:20,713 --> 01:18:25,173
Does anyone know how to
fly one of these things?

1028
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:27,215
Don't look at me!

1029
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:30,753
In theory, I can do it!

1030
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:40,965
- And in practice?
- Let’s do it!

1031
01:18:41,233 --> 01:18:45,898
And this here goes- I'm
doing it, I'm flying!

1032
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,072
I'm flying—look at this!

1033
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:50,639
Chiko, look! A news camera!

1034
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:52,002
It's recording everything!

1035
01:18:52,244 --> 01:18:55,009
I'm gonna record you,
so even after you die—

1036
01:18:55,247 --> 01:18:56,908
Which, let's face it,
pal, under the current

1037
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,117
circumstances, is probably
only a matter of seconds

1038
01:18:59,385 --> 01:19:02,252
THEN, they'll find the
video, and know

1039
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:05,423
that once upon a time
lived the great Chiko!

1040
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:08,525
A real hedgehog for the ages.
You'll be famous! A legend! A STAR!

1041
01:19:09,728 --> 01:19:12,891
Oh good, more turbulence...

1042
01:19:13,132 --> 01:19:17,069
- Where are we?
- Somevhere over big vater.

1043
01:19:17,303 --> 01:19:22,639
Either we've been blown way out to sea, or
we're going in circles, I can't tell...

1044
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:29,111
Hey, look! I see a light!

1045
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:32,215
Those were my mother's last words...

1046
01:19:32,484 --> 01:19:34,578
- What light? Where?!
- It's a city!!

1047
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:36,845
Come on, come on, press
something, come on!

1048
01:19:37,122 --> 01:19:39,147
Take us down before we
all get blown BACK!!

1049
01:19:39,425 --> 01:19:41,587
Krash! No!

1050
01:20:08,854 --> 01:20:10,879
H-h-holy carrot!
That’s our lighthouse!

1051
01:20:11,156 --> 01:20:14,820
No place like home! Bring
it nice and easy now...

1052
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,529
Now we just need a nice landing.

1053
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:43,453
Bam bam, cool!

1054
01:20:43,722 --> 01:20:47,556
Yes, Lucien was a TV hero.

1055
01:20:47,826 --> 01:20:49,191
Doesn't matter at all.

1056
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:51,021
Whether it's a hero or not

1057
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:54,426
we got more important then that.

1058
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:56,998
And I like that.

1059
01:20:57,236 --> 01:20:57,862
Hold still.

1060
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:00,435
Don't move!

1061
01:21:03,909 --> 01:21:07,675
Al right Chiko, here we go,
time for your big scene.

1062
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:13,150
You've finally captured Caligari
and you've got him all tied up!

1063
01:21:13,419 --> 01:21:14,113
Yeeahh.

1064
01:21:14,386 --> 01:21:16,855
Okay, Caligari, ready to do this?

1065
01:21:17,089 --> 01:21:18,853
You're angry, you're scared.

1066
01:21:19,091 --> 01:21:23,119
You're ready to run. Feel
it but don't over feel it.

1067
01:21:23,395 --> 01:21:24,885
Action!

1068
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:33,704
- So... are we there yet?
- Nah, not yet.

1069
01:21:33,939 --> 01:21:36,806
Almost there.

1070
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:41,670
So, you know how they say that behind
every great man is a great woman?

1071
01:21:41,947 --> 01:21:44,644
Well, here I am behind you...
and you are the greatest...

1072
01:21:44,917 --> 01:21:46,510
You see, Rosa, after all we've been
through, there's nothing to be afraid of

1073
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,242
anymore and I can finally just let the
words flow straight from my heart...

1074
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:52,287
Rosa, you are the only one
that I have ever loved. There.

1075
01:21:52,558 --> 01:21:53,081
There! I said it!

1076
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:55,657
You do know she's still lost
her hearing from the accident,

1077
01:21:55,928 --> 01:21:57,953
- right Wally?
- I know, I know,

1078
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:00,722
but at least I can practice.

1079
01:22:00,966 --> 01:22:03,594
You are smokin', Action Star.

1080
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:06,328
This and a Ferrari and I'm there.

1081
01:22:06,605 --> 01:22:10,098
Hurry it up, hot stuff!
You're already beautiful.

1082
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:12,674
Coming, handsome!

1083
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:14,376
Hold on!

1084
01:22:15,914 --> 01:22:17,780
Here! How's this?

1085
01:22:22,321 --> 01:22:24,653
Okey-doke, Peeplez!

1086
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:32,996
Please! Come on...Can
I open my eyes now?

1087
01:22:33,265 --> 01:22:34,391
Almost there.

1088
01:22:34,633 --> 01:22:36,328
Scarf OFF!

1089
01:22:38,137 --> 01:22:39,832
Okay!

1090
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:43,198
That is one FINE lookin'
house you got there!

1091
01:22:43,475 --> 01:22:44,840
It is lovely, isn't it?

1092
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:47,943
Like they used to
make back in the day!

1093
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:52,845
- And it comes with a real sturdy BENCH!
- Handy to have out in the yard!

1094
01:22:53,118 --> 01:22:57,385
- It's a beaut. Just perfect!
- Thanks, Berry!

1095
01:22:57,623 --> 01:23:01,560
And it's got a fireplace,
garden and pot - belly stove!

1096
01:23:01,793 --> 01:23:02,726
Uh, Rosa?

1097
01:23:02,961 --> 01:23:06,556
So, that means your hearing's back...

1098
01:23:07,032 --> 01:23:08,864
Say something?

1099
01:23:09,134 --> 01:23:12,297
So which one of you
does this belong to?

1100
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:16,337
That, my dear friend... That
little number is yours! Go on!

1101
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:19,010
- Step in!
- You crazy?

1102
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:23,374
You want to... give this to me!
You guys are nuts!

1103
01:23:23,649 --> 01:23:25,242
I- I can't believe you folks!

1104
01:23:25,484 --> 01:23:28,112
I can’t just, come on! We're
talking about a house!

1105
01:23:28,353 --> 01:23:31,846
Sorry, dear chap! It looks like
you're stuck here...with us.

1106
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,582
- Welcome Home!

1107
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:36,624
Go ahead, Barry!

1108
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:53,105
Ok guys, this is your last chance--

1109
01:23:53,378 --> 01:24:00,717
Going, going, going and a half—GONE!

1110
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:06,551
Okay! I'm thinking, once a guy has a
house, it's time to have a house party!

1111
01:24:07,092 --> 01:24:09,584
I think it's time we get it started right now!

1112
01:24:09,861 --> 01:24:12,660
Come on, people, shake a leg!

1113
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:25,808
My friends! Attention, my friends...?

1114
01:24:26,078 --> 01:24:29,537
A photo for posterity!

1115
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:43,292
Okay, we're a bunch of fools.

1116
01:24:43,562 --> 01:24:46,691
We crashed a blimp and broke
every single bone in our bodies!

1117
01:24:46,932 --> 01:24:51,233
But we found two new guys that
we can CREAM in badminton!

1118
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,547
Wait! We're-we're a cleaning service!

1119
01:30:38,817 --> 01:30:40,615
I could polish that gun for you...!

1120
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:44,152
So, can you tell us Eugene,
how did you catch them?

1121
01:30:44,422 --> 01:30:50,054
Episode 112- The Case of the
Super-glued Steering Wheel

1122
01:30:50,295 --> 01:30:51,820
I'm so confused,

1123
01:30:52,097 --> 01:30:53,462
is this news, or is this the show?

1124
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:56,065
I'm totally meshugenah.
