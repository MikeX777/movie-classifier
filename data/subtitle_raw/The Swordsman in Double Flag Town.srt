2
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,401
This is a legendary story

3
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,317
According to the old folks,

4
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:35,400
when Haige came to Double Flag Town,

5
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,526
it was still a vast desert

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,163
Some say it was eighty-one years ago,

7
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,284
others say it was seventy-one

8
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,373
Either way, it's a thrilling story
of the Chinese West

Have you seen the Lethal Swordsman?

20
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,760
Shit, are you trying to scare me?

21
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,337
That horse is foaming at the mouth.
Do you want it to die of thirst?

22
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,721
Do you have any dry food?

23
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,398
You seem intelligent

24
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,944
Do you know who I am?

25
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,160
For five hundred miles around,

26
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,161
there isn't anyone who hasn't heard of me.
I am Desert Eagle, a knight-errant

27
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,878
Well, don't you know?

28
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,636
Don't be in such a hurry!

29
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,431
Cold water will choke you and break your lungs!

30
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,529
First time traveling, right?

31
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,950
- Where are you going?
- To Double Flag Town

32
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,165
Double Flag Town? Alone?

33
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:50,003
That's no place for a boy on his own

34
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,880
I am going to get a wife

35
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,719
Ah, a child like you...

36
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,508
...speaks of getting a wife?

37
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,009
What does she look like?

38
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,147
I have never seen her

39
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,148
Well, we are going the same way.
Just follow me

40
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,447
With this flying sandsword, I travel all over...

41
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,415
...to weed out the wicked and help the poor

42
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,872
I bet you can't find another
man like me in the Northwest

43
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,547
Hey, can you lend me some money?

44
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,053
I am saving it for the wedding

45
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,722
Then it's ok

46
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:50,556
Look, this road leads to Double Flag Town

47
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,276
Hey, knight-errant!

48
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,167
I think you're a good man.
Here is half my money

49
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,165
If you run into any trouble,

50
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,133
come to Dry Straw to find me

51
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,692
I need a saddle in two days!

52
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,988
- Who is that on horseback?
- Is he a swordsman?

53
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,460
Fire!

54
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:03,799
We have aged wine and
specially tenderized horsemeat

55
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,543
Let's go and look

56
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,712
What are they doing?

57
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,845
Have you seen the Lethal Swordsman?

58
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,324
Hi! Are you two from the West?

59
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,415
Let me do it

60
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,965
Come in, please

61
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,307
Little Pigtail, what are you here for?

62
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,513
I am here to fetch my wife

63
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,558
The Little Pigtail! The Little Pigtail!

64
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,473
Brother Chang, busy?

65
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,105
Whose daughter? What is her name?

66
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:50,697
I don't know her name.
My father arranged for me when I was a boy

67
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,658
She has a mole on her butt

68
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,570
On his deathbed, my father told me that...

69
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,618
...my would-be-father-in-law is a lame man

70
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,867
Do you know him?

71
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,789
What does he do?

72
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,132
No, there is no lame man in this town

73
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,719
My memory is bad? Not in this town maybe?

74
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,392
My dad couldn't speak clearly at his death

75
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,502
No food for you! Go elsewhere!

76
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,845
Haomei, who are you talking to?

77
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,222
A dirty kid with a pigtail

78
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,395
He dared to knock on our door at midnight

79
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,114
Pretending to be a swordsman...

80
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,326
...with two rags on his legs

81
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,631
Where are you from, you bastard?

82
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,005
- Stop!
- Dad, beat him hard!

83
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,806
What have you done?!

84
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,470
Stop!

85
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,969
Stop! You wild rat!

86
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,516
I'll beat you to death!

87
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:34,694
Kowtow to my father-in-law

88
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:49,668
The Lethal Swordsman is coming!

89
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,690
I've been looking for you for seven years

90
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,072
Pull out your sword

91
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:29,971
My leg was injured in a swordfight

92
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:34,100
I couldn't fight with your father any more

93
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,354
I quit my wandering life many years ago

94
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:43,605
I opened this restaurant to make a living

95
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,984
I am not the man I used to be

96
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,702
My father sent me here to find my bride

97
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:03,584
Stay here, we can discuss it later

98
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,547
Haomei

99
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,640
Haomei

100
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,354
Come and see your big uncle's son

101
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,940
I never want to see him

102
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,530
Never!

103
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,577
Where does this uncle come from?

104
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:53,797
When his father was alive,
I betrothed my daughter to his son

105
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,307
to protect her

106
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:02,973
But now, I have only one leg,

107
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,272
and the whole world is a mess

108
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:15,243
Besides, that child has
neither skills with a sword nor common sense

109
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,862
If something happens to me,

110
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,581
how can I leave Haomei in his hands?

111
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:16,967
Such a young kid yet he practices
Midnight Emptiness Kung fu?

112
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:43,407
From this day on, you'll work here

113
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,911
In this town, you must remember three virtues

114
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,788
The hand virtue, the foot virtue
and the eye virtue

115
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,551
There are also these rules

116
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,643
Never be inquisitive,

117
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:09,562
and never talk with strangers

118
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,696
Too many people come here to seek their revenge

119
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:19,985
One slip of the tongue can kill a man

120
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,367
Haige

121
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:36,042
Pick the bones out of this carcass for cooking

122
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,795
At work, never carry your daggers

123
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:20,920
Take them off!

124
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:28,933
My dad said that if my head is on my shoulders,
my swords stays on my body

125
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,856
I doubt if he knows Kung fu

126
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,604
What a shame to carry the daggers

127
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,764
How stupid!
Look how much lean meat you're wasting!

128
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,811
Watch!

129
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,524
Watch! Did you see?

130
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,492
Eye virtue!

131
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:40,924
Lame Big Brother!

132
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,761
It was said that your son-in-law has come

133
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:47,598
He's my brother's child. My nephew

134
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,719
Oh? Folks are talking...

135
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,012
It's none of your business!

136
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,190
What's the big deal?

137
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,024
The art of your father's swordsmanship

138
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,740
has never been seen in books

139
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:18,750
In the past years he defeated
countless famous swordsmen

140
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,623
He was well recognized in the Northwest

141
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:29,595
His swordart absorbed the essence
of fist and palm boxing

142
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:37,019
To laymen, his technique looked very simple

143
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:46,699
It had neither fancy maneuvers
nor a life-threatening whistle

144
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:51,700
But a professional swordsman
understand its deadly strokes

145
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,374
Most important part is when he unsheathes
his sword for his last deadly stroke

146
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,709
The sword carries his breathing strength,

147
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,875
which in turn pushes the sword

148
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,963
You can't tell when the sword
is out of the sheathe,

149
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,585
and when its tip stabs into the enemy's flesh

150
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,587
This swiftness all depends on
one's breathing strength

151
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:14,017
Without it, it is impossible
to perform this maneuver

152
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,479
Even if you want to learn,
you are not able to

153
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,353
Haomei, Haige.
Tomorrow you go out and walk the horses

154
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,156
- I don't want to go with him
- Haomei!

155
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,132
Look, the Little Pigtail

156
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:50,679
Look!

157
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:56,059
The Little Pigtail without little tail

158
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,100
Good Little Sister is walking with a Little Pigtail

159
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,643
without a little tail!

160
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,392
Good Little Sister!

161
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:07,237
Good Little Sister is walking with
a Little Pigtail

162
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,151
without a little tail!

163
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,150


164
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,950
Good Little Sister is going to marry!

165
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,786
Good Little Sister is going to marry!

166
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,893
We don't want him!

167
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,808
Tell him to leave! We don't want him!

168
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,022
Tell him to leave!

169
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,352
Little Pigtail! Tell him to leave!

170
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:50,527
We don't want him! Tell him to leave!

171
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,199
Little Pigtail!

172
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,039
I am afraid the weather is going to change

173
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:09,836
Stay up late tonight,
and put some wood in the stove

174
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,708
Don't let the fire die out

175
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,925
Haomei

176
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,596
Let me tell you the truth

177
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,098
Haige came here...

178
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,727
...to take you home as his bride

179
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:42,245
But he's not the one I'm satisfied with

180
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:52,167
Go to sleep. I won't allow this marriage

181
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:04,513
When the knife cuts into the flesh, go along
the bone. Don't use sheer animal strength

182
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,891
You father should have taught you this...

183
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,731
...if he taught you martial arts. Did he?

184
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,067
Everything about him is marvelous except
that he doesn't have common sense

185
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:32,666
Haomei, you go and take the leather on

186
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,583
our backyard fence to Uncle Tanner

187
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,460
- Did you hear?
- Yes, Daddy

188
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:46,884
Let's go

189
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,697
Watch, let me show you

190
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,775
If you really want to learn skills,

191
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:06,946
you should watch, ask and practice

192
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,746
Let me try

193
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,810
When my father was alive,

194
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,819
a big man carrying a sword said to him that...

195
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,984
...he could cut a very thick tree trunk

196
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,362
in two with the back of his sword

197
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,613
My father said that...

198
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:35,583
...he could do it with his hand

199
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,836
How thick was the tree trunk?

200
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,753
This thick

201
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,638
There was a large crowd around the backyard

202
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,515
After a roar from my father...

203
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,645
Did he cut it in two?

204
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,648
No. He only made a twenty-inch crack

205
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,243
For this my father lost five acres of land

206
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,503
I say your father is not a loser,
cracking should be counted as breaking

207
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,377
Later my dad told me that...

208
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:30,047
...at the time he farted,
losing some of his energy

209
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,507
Otherwise, he could have cut it in two

210
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,290
- Haomei
- Yes?

211
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,537
Your butt...

212
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,044
Is there a mole on your butt?

213
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:12,256
My dad said the girl
whose butt has a mole is my bride

214
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,804
What are you talking about? Nonsense!

215
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,685
Haomei!

216
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,030
Haomei! Stop!

217
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,489
Hold on a second !

218
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,306
I taught you to have the eye virtue!

219
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:39,267
Never look at what you're not supposed to!

220
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,762
I wanted to see if her butt has a mole!

221
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,184


222
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,306
Dad

223
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,190
Stand aside!

224
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,443
Watch, today I will spank him
like he'll never forget!

225
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,154


226
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,107
Dad. Please stop

227
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,210
I bet this!

228
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,725
Come on! Come on!

229
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,479
Come on! Come on!

230
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,775
You lose!

231
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:55,897
- Man, more wine!
- I am coming!

232
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,660
- Lame Man!
- Yes

233
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:14,465
Lame Man » where is your pretty daughter?

234
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:18,885
She is sick and at home in bed

235
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:28,808
Lame Man, go ahead and feed my horse

236
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,149
Yes, sir. It will be well attended

237
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,252
Let's see what happens

238
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,298
What are you doing?

239
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,634
- Come on, let me touch!
- Let me go! Let me go!

240
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:09,557
Daddy! Let me go!

241
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:15,358
Let me go!

242
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,394
Daddy! Daddy!

243
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:20,022
Help me!

244
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,362
After you feed the horse,
come to the hall and help

245
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,907
Daddy! Help me!

246
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,155
- Haomei!
- Daddy! Help me!

247
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,829


248
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:35,249
- Daddy! Help me!
- Second Big Brother!

249
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:39,591
Daddy! Help me!

250
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:44,672
Second Big Brother, please don't!

251
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:47,841
Stop!

252
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,401
- Daddy!
- Haomei!

253
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,410
You little bastard! Pull out your sword!

254
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:31,718
She is my bride!

255
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,725
Your bride?

256
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,233
This pretty girl?

257
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:41,695
You sleep with her? You sleep with
a little pretty lady Budhlsattva?

258
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:45,023
A little shit like you should have
this pretty lady fortune?

259
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:34,243
Second Big Brother has been killed!

260
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:40,121
Second Big Brother has been killed!

261
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,214
It wasn't me

262
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:46,043
I didn't do it. I don't know

263
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,634
The Little Pigtail killed him!

264
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,162
You think the Lethal Swordsman
is easy to deal with?

265
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,622
The kid killed his second brother

266
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:23,046
The bastard will certainly
create a blood bath in our town

267
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,717
The Lethal Swordsman has been well known
in the Northwest for more than twenty years

268
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,054
The Lethal Swordsman has been well known
in the Northwest for more than twenty years

269
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:38,721
He always kills with one deadly stroke

270
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:43,892
If your father was still alive,
maybe he could have dealt with him

271
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:49,814
But now...

272
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:26,309
Haomei

273
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:31,527
From today on, you are his woman

274
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:38,284
He lives, you live.
He dies, you die

275
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,997
Haige, Haomei is yours now

276
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:48,335
You must treat her well from now on

277
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,344
Get up

278
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:04,856
Pack. Leave at daybreak

279
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:09,816
The Lethal Swordsman and his men
will be here in three days

280
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:13,190
If you can't get out of the desert, you'll die

281
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:27,792
If you see a little swordsman here,
let him stay!

282
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,050
Quick!

283
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,215
This is...

284
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:43,889
You...

285
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,050
You, little brother

286
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:50,104
we Double Flag Town folks beg you

287
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,975
You can't leave

288
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,312
Since you killed Lethal Swordsman's brother,

289
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:59,360
he will come

290
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,653
What can we do without you?

291
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,578
Big Lame Brother, he must not leave

292
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,868
If you don't stay, we'll be
on our knees till we die

293
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:17,423
But he is only a child

294
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:23,467
Little Swordsman, your Kung fu is outstanding

295
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:26,182
If you can do away with this bully,

296
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:28,722
you are the hero of the people
of Double Flag Town

297
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:31,012
You can't leave!

298
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,945
The people are right

299
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,361
They are right

300
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,498
We should face the catastrophe...

301
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,627
...that we created

302
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,625
Come on. Go on eating

303
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:48,173
Floating sand stirring wind! I got it!

304
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,728
Be careful on your way

305
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,227
- Go quickly and be back soon
- I will

306
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:14,037
The Little Pigtail is running away!

307
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:18,919
The Little Pigtail is running away!

308
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:22,336
He can't leave!

309
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,814
You coward!

310
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,603
Are you trying to let him escape?

311
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:42,317
No, no

312
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:44,938
Stop dreaming! You can't get away!

313
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,740
You can't go away!

314
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:52,245
If you run away, whom should we turn to?

315
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:55,369
I'm not drunk

316
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:59,331
My feet haven't turned red yet.
Don't try to fool us!

317
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,627
Everybody,

318
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:08,670
he is going to find the Desert Eagle for help

319
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,967
The Desert Eagle?

320
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:17,603
I know him. This man is marvelous

321
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:21,607
I made horseshoes for him.
Maybe he's the man to fight the Lethal Swordsman

322
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:26,070
He asks for big money! Will he come?

323
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:30,487
Haige helped him once.
He will certainly come

324
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:34,412
How can we trust you?
You can't depend on a promise

325
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,037
What if the Little Pigtail doesn't come back?

326
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:43,079
- I guarantee he will
- How can you guarantee that?

327
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:47,049
I allowed him to marry Haomei,
so he is my son-in-law

328
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,217
If he won't return,

329
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:53,055
me and Haomei will wait
for the Lethal Swordsman to claim our heads

330
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:55,265


331
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,057
Yes, he should hurry up to get there

332
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:28,916
I'll be back

333
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:07,254
More wine

334
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:12,467
You owe me money. How dare you act rude here?

335
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,431
I owe you money?

336
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:26,019
Yes, I owe you money. I won't deny it

337
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,976
Desert Eagle helps the poor
and give tyrants their due

338
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:31,604
I deserve more and you know it

339
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,741
I just owe you a little money

340
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:40,906
I admitted that. Why worry?

341
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:50,043
Watch. It's silver

342
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:59,554


343
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:24,039
Although my brother
is not a first class swordsman,

344
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,708
his sword art is outstanding

345
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:32,290
His swordsmanship must be extraordinary

346
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:40,139
Tell everyone we will meet at Double Flag Town

347
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,948
Are you having trouble with the Lethal Swordsman?

348
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,378
I killed his little brother

349
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:15,837
I wanted to leave town with my bride,
but the townspeople wouldn't let me leave

350
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:20,467
They all said that the Lethal Swordsman
would come for revenge

351
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:24,642
I've come here for help

352
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:31,561
With or without you, sooner or later.

353
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,479
I would've cut him in two

354
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,106
Well, eat

355
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:52,037
Don't worry.
Death is fast approaching for the Lethal Swordsman

356
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:57,633
- Do you have any money?
- Yes. This is all I have

357
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:12,315
Fuck! I still owe that woman for the hotel bill

358
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,772
If you are able to help,
my father-in-law will pay you well

359
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:25,202
I'm always easy to bargain with. Eat!

360
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,037
When will the Lethal Swordsman arrive?

361
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,661
In two days

362
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:37,749
Well, I'll see you the day after tomorrow,
at high noon

363
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,339
Haven't you seen that boy's rolling eyes?

364
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,337
You can tell he's a bastard

365
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:29,179
He wouldn't leave his bride here, would he?

366
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,978
Women are men's foot-rags.
You can go anywhere to pick them up

367
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,598
We may witness a bloody drama

368
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:40,606
Wait for death.
The Lethal Swordsman is coming tomorrow

369
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:44,023
Wait for death! Wait for death!

370
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,790
The Little Pigtail will come back

371
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,453
It's hard to say

372
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,666
We are folks. How can he cheat us?

373
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,583
She's coming

374
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:29,587
Why hasn't the Little Pigtail come back?

375
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,588
He never knew the Desert Eagle in the first place!

376
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,840
He never knew him! You lied!

377
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:35,388
You go bring him back!

378
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:36,977
Bring him back!

379
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,846
Come on now. Leave him alone

380
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,727
The Lame Brother is not that sort of man

381
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:44,568
He will by no means abandon us

382
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,898
It's still broad daylight. We must have patience!

383
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,820
Let's wait!

384
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:02,138
Haige!

385
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:01,701
Haige did it! He persuaded
the Desert Eagle to come and help us

386
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,449
Let's toast to him

387
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,626
I can't drink

388
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,505
You're our hero!

389
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,882
Drink!

390
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:18,506
The Lethal Swordsman
isn't the rival of Desert Eagle

391
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:21,596
We're going to see some action!

392
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:45,786
The Desert Eagle fights the Lethal Swordsman

393
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:48,372
We're going to see some action!

394
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,545
Saaaa, floating sand stirring wind

395
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:59,138
Shoooooo, a swimming snake shaking its tail

396
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:04,469
Huaaaa, a hand rising and sword falling

397
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:09,474
Yeeee, blood splashing

398
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,703
Who do you think will win?

399
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,280
I say the Lethal Swordsman

400
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:29,125
The Desert Eagle is also a hero

401
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,209
Let's bet!

402
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:33,751
- No problem! I bet one goat!
- One goat!

403
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,420
Whoever regrets is a son of a bitch!

404
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:39,628
- Settled!
- OK! A goat!

405
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:46,142
Drink

406
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:09,893
Haomei, do you have a mole on your butt?

407
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:12,103
Haven't you seen it?

408
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,353
The door fell down before I saw it

409
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:23,036
Set a fire!

410
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:31,523
Do you want to die?

411
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:45,364
He hasn't shown up

412
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:57,012
Daddy!

413
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,686
Stay here!

414
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:06,610
- Daddy! Come back!
- Don't go!

415
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:10,864
Daddy!

416
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:14,489
Daddy! Come back!

417
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:40,731
I killed your brother!
It has nothing to do with the others!

418
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:42,270
Go ahead, draw your sword!

419
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:53,661
Daddy! Let me go!

420
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:06,424
Daddy!

421
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:10,216
Haomei

422
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,474
- Come back!
- Daddy!

423
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:51,003
Daddy! Wake up!

424
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:00,720
Stop!

425
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:15,613
He's only a child

426
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:18,534
If you want revenge,
it won't be too late when he grows up

427
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:27,625
It's not decent for a swordsman

428
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,254
like you to kill a child!

429
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:06,161
Floating sand stirring wind

430
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:09,789
A swimming snake shaking its tail

431
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:31,402
Wake up. Drink

432
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:38,660
Who says that the Desert Eagle hasn't shown up?

433
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:46,829
I am the Desert Eagle

434
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:52,837
I am the Desert Eagle

435
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:08,189
I haven't drunk too much

436
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:10,479
Look at my feet. They're not red

437
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:47,048
From who did you learn the sword art?

438
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:17,514
Floating sand stirring the wind!

439
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:21,021
Where is the Lethal Swordsman?

440
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:18,912
Quit crying!

441
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:23,542
I already knew he wasn't your match

442
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:32,012
My money! Didn't we have a deal?

443
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:43,770
My dear nephew?

444
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:48,020
My dear nephew!

445
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:57,530
I didn't get the worst of it.
This sword has a gold handle

446
01:28:58,041 --> 01:28:59,623
You cheated me

447
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:10,300
You are not grateful, but I can't be unkind

448
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:11,714
If you need me,

449
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:13,928
I'll be at Dry Straw
