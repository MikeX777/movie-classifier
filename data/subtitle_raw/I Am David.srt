1
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:44,226
Are you listening to me?

2
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:49,857
You must escape from here tonight.
It's your only chance to stay alive.

3
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,569
If you follow my instructions
and make it out of the camp...

4
00:00:53,694 --> 00:00:57,281
...travel when it's dark
to flee Bulgaria so you won't be seen.

5
00:00:57,573 --> 00:00:59,950
They'll be everywhere waiting
to arrest you...

6
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:03,120
...and unless you're very careful,
you'll be caught.

7
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,793
If you make it across the border,
you must get this envelope to Denmark.

8
00:01:10,794 --> 00:01:15,716
First, head south to Salonika and hide
on a ship that's going to Italy.

9
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:19,303
When you arrive there,
travel north as far as you can.

10
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:22,764
Your journey will be long
and it may be impossible...

11
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,018
... but you must get this evelope
to the authorities in Denmark.

12
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:28,854
You must not open it.

13
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,149
If anyone sees it's contents
before you get there...

14
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:33,817
...you'll end up back here.

15
00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:36,528
Do you understand?

16
00:01:36,903 --> 00:01:39,489
I know you've lived
in this camp your entire life...

17
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:42,367
...but there is a world outside it.

18
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:44,786
However, it's a very dangerous world.

19
00:01:44,953 --> 00:01:46,454
Trust no one.

20
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:15,692
When the time comes,
get from the barracks to the west fence.

21
00:04:43,755 --> 00:04:44,631
When you see the signal,

22
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:46,800
you will have 30 seconds
to get over the fence...

23
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:49,135
...before the current is turned back on.

24
00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:33,012
Shoot me.

25
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:25,773
Hidden behind the log at the edge
of the field...

26
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:29,568
...you will find a bunndle filled with
items you will need for your journey.

27
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:17,449
If you follow my instructions
and make it out of the camp...

28
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:21,411
...travel when it's dark
to flee Bulgaria so you won't be seen.

29
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:24,957
You must do everything I just told you
if you want to escape.

30
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:27,125
They're moving me
to another camp tomorrow...

31
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:29,711
...and I can no longer watch over you.

32
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:56,529
Follow your compass south to Salonika.

33
00:07:56,696 --> 00:07:59,199
Travel there by any means possible.

34
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,043
Who did it?

35
00:09:47,514 --> 00:09:50,100
Get out! Get out now!

36
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:56,857
You want to escape this paradise?
Are you that ungrateful?

37
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:52,120
The border between Bulgaria
and Greece is heavily gurarded...

38
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:56,625
...and much of the fence is strung
with alarm wires. Do not touch it.

39
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:22,358
Stop him! Stop him! Stop, little boy!

40
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:25,445
Come back here! Come back!

41
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:31,534
Stop! Where do you think you're going?
You cannot escape!

42
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:34,162
Stop! We will get you!

43
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:36,873
Stop!

44
00:11:37,874 --> 00:11:39,667
Stop!

45
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:43,379
We will get you!

46
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,599
Follow your compass south to Salonika...

47
00:11:54,724 --> 00:11:57,018
...and hide on a ship
that's going to Italy.

48
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:45,107
-Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
-Okay. Good work.

49
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:11,884
Hey! Why isn't this hatch closed?

50
00:14:40,471 --> 00:14:41,890
Johannes...

51
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:44,225
...am I dead?

52
00:14:45,894 --> 00:14:46,853
No.

53
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,690
I don't think I can make it.
They're going to find me.

54
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:54,610
Not if you're careful.
You must remain unseen.

55
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:56,571
And if you are seen,

56
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,157
you must blend in with the people
around you.

57
00:14:59,282 --> 00:15:00,366
How?

58
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:04,245
You know many languages from
the different men you knew in the camp.

59
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:09,083
Just listen closely and you'll be able
to speak to people...

60
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,877
...and understand them.

61
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,129
I'm afraid.

62
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:15,923
There are places where
the world is good.

63
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,925
I've seen them.

64
00:15:18,426 --> 00:15:22,305
A long time ago, but I have seen them.

65
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,016
You will, too.

66
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:27,935
Why didn't you come with me?

67
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:30,187
This is your journey.

68
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:35,192
-I have my own.
-But what am I looking for?

69
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,821
What am I gonna find in Denmark?

70
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:40,573
Freedom.

71
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:44,034
But I don't even know who I am.

72
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:57,172
What are you doing in my spot?

73
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,634
You dind't touch my magazines, did you?

74
00:16:04,888 --> 00:16:08,142
I've got to report all stowaways
to the captain. You're in big trouble.

75
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:11,520
No, please don't tell him.
I need to get to Italy.

76
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:18,235
I'll give you this
if you don't turn me in!

77
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,411
Pearl handle.

78
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:30,122
Pretty nice. It looks Soviet.

79
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:34,042
Throw in the compass
and you've got a deal.

80
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:37,004
I can't. Just the knife.

81
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:41,425
You know, I could take this
and trun you in anyway.

82
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:44,344
But I'm an honest guy...

83
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:48,682
...and l'd probably get in trouble
for not turning you in sooner.

84
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:51,226
Okay, you've got yourself a deal.

85
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:53,854
Roberto, quit looking
at your magazines and get up here!

86
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,898
Keep your pants on, I'll be right up.

87
00:16:57,441 --> 00:17:00,360
Look, I can't take a chance
on anybody seeing you...

88
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:02,696
...getting off the ship
when we get into port.

89
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,615
So when we're close to shore,
I'll lower you overboard...

90
00:17:05,782 --> 00:17:07,951
...then you can swim to land.

91
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:16,376
Don't worry. The current will help you
drift to the coast.

92
00:17:17,294 --> 00:17:18,461
You all set?

93
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:21,047
Have fun.

94
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:33,744
Once you arrive in Italy,
travel north until you reach Denmark.

95
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:04,751
Why do they hate us so much, Johannes?

96
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:06,545
Because it's easy to hate people

97
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:08,839
who don't believe
the same things you do.

98
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:11,383
Did my parents not believe what
the guards believe?

99
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,176
Is that why I'm in here?

100
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:15,512
I didn't know anything
about your parents, but...

101
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,265
...I would assume so.

102
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:20,141
I don't remember them.

103
00:20:21,393 --> 00:20:23,478
Do you know what they were like?

104
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:26,523
What they believed ?
Where we were from?

105
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:28,149
David...

106
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:30,110
...I don't know anything about you.

107
00:20:30,235 --> 00:20:31,945
I wish I were dead.

108
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:34,948
Don't ever say that.
Don't even think it.

109
00:20:35,073 --> 00:20:37,492
Why not? There's nothing good here.

110
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:39,786
What's the point in even staying alive?

111
00:20:39,953 --> 00:20:43,414
If you're alive, you can change things.
If you're dead, you can't.

112
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:47,836
Do whatever you can to stay alive,
no matter what. Go.

113
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:04,060
I know you've lived
in this camp your entire life...

114
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:06,729
...but there is a world outside it.

115
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,899
However, it's a very dangerous world.

116
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:12,860
Trust no one.

117
00:21:57,655 --> 00:21:59,532
Beautiful loaves, huh?

118
00:21:59,657 --> 00:22:01,575
Sorry to scare you.

119
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:03,994
You want to get some bread?

120
00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:07,373
-Yes, please.
-Do you have any money?

121
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,166
No.

122
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,669
I'm afraid my bread is not free.

123
00:22:11,835 --> 00:22:13,420
Where do you live?

124
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:17,883
I'm in the circus.

125
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,177
In the circus?

126
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:24,139
Well, it's not going to be here
for another 2 weeks.

127
00:22:24,264 --> 00:22:26,684
I think you are a little early.

128
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,896
Where can I get some money
for some bread, sir?

129
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:34,775
Just take a look at this kitchen.

130
00:22:34,942 --> 00:22:36,026
It's spotless.

131
00:22:36,193 --> 00:22:39,655
And over there,
that's a traditional wood-burning oven.

132
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,867
You know what Abruzzi
down the street bakes his bread with?

133
00:22:44,034 --> 00:22:45,452
Gas.

134
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:50,499
And still people buy from him
instead of me! It's unbelievable!

135
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:57,130
You know,
before I can give you some bread...

136
00:22:57,297 --> 00:23:00,008
...you have to do something for me.

137
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:03,804
-You have to smile.
-Why?

138
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,558
Why? Because you're about to have
the best bread in Italy.

139
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:10,268
That's why.

140
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:20,904
Oh, Saint Elizabeth...

141
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:26,076
...the boy wants to know why
he should smile.

142
00:23:26,243 --> 00:23:28,703
I don't think he know how to.

143
00:23:29,037 --> 00:23:30,372
Who's that?

144
00:23:30,497 --> 00:23:32,540
That's Saint Elizabeth.

145
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:35,043
She's the patron saint of bakers.

146
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,630
She takes care of everyone
who needs help.

147
00:23:38,755 --> 00:23:41,174
But especially bakers.

148
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:43,760
Here, see for yourself.

149
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:46,971
You keep that...

150
00:23:47,138 --> 00:23:50,683
...and maybe she'll help you
out sometime, too.

151
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,435
I'll tell you what.

152
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:57,190
Just stay here and I'll pick you
out a nice, fresh loaf.

153
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:32,099
There is something about his face...

154
00:24:32,266 --> 00:24:34,310
...his eyes.

155
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:37,813
They are not the eyes of a normal boy.

156
00:24:37,939 --> 00:24:40,274
Come and see for yourselves.

157
00:24:43,361 --> 00:24:46,572
My friends want to talk to you.

158
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:52,495
They just want to know who you are.
Nothing to worry about.

159
00:24:55,247 --> 00:24:58,292
We need to ask you a few questions.

160
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:06,842
I'm trying to help you.
You've got to believe me!

161
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:08,260
Let me go!

162
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:50,677
Travel north as far as you can.

163
00:25:51,011 --> 00:25:52,763
Good luck to you.

164
00:26:19,748 --> 00:26:23,418
Line up, right now! Line up!

165
00:26:24,836 --> 00:26:28,632
Line up over here right now! Right now!

166
00:26:28,924 --> 00:26:30,550
Who did it?

167
00:26:30,842 --> 00:26:32,594
Which one of you is responsible?

168
00:26:35,221 --> 00:26:37,432
It was him. I know it.

169
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:38,933
Shoot him!

170
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,321
Saint Elizabeth...

171
00:26:51,488 --> 00:26:53,156
...my name is David...

172
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:56,951
...and, well, the baker told me that
you help people.

173
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:58,828
I want to get to Denmark...

174
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:01,831
...and I need help getting out
of these woods.

175
00:27:01,998 --> 00:27:04,125
I have to get to Denmark...

176
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:07,128
...and I can't if I'm lost in here.

177
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:47,251
You must remain unseen.

178
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:49,587
And if you are seen,

179
00:27:49,712 --> 00:27:52,715
you must blend in with the people
around you.

180
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:57,053
Oh, Saint Elizabeth,

181
00:27:57,261 --> 00:28:00,222
the boy wants to know why
he should smile.

182
00:28:00,431 --> 00:28:02,767
I don't think he knows how to.

183
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:20,492
Saint Elizabeth, remember how I said
I wouldn't ask you for anything else?

184
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:37,634
Go away! Please go away!

185
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,553
I didn't mean to make you mad.

186
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:43,640
I promise,
I was just trying to blend in.

187
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:46,226
Gina! Be quiet!

188
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:50,022
What are you doing in my vineyard?
Were you eating my grapes?

189
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:54,234
Well, it's a good thing you are here
because I need help. Come along.

190
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:57,070
Come on.

191
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:00,908
Thank God Gina caught you.
I'm desperate.

192
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:04,661
I need you to run this wine over
to the Bertelli's party.

193
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,830
Please be careful.

194
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,085
Now, it's 3 farms up the road
and here's 2 lira for your trouble.

195
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:16,798
What? I'm not giving you more.

196
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:20,302
-Do you know which way is north?
-What do I look like, a compass?

197
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:22,387
I have no idea.
Ask the Bertellis. Now go.

198
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:25,932
Go, go. Go!

199
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:33,648
Gina, you bad dog! Come!

200
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,785
Finally!

201
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:31,414
Where have you been?
You should have been here an hour ago.

202
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,587
Good news, everyone! The wine is here.

203
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,674
3 cheers for the delivery boy!

204
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:46,179
I don't need any strange-looking
urchins at my party.

205
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:48,014
Now scat!

206
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,228
What's the matter with you?

207
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,814
You have to go to the toilet
or something?

208
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,986
-l'd like to buy some food, please.
-Well, congratulations.

209
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:48,991
-You came to the right place.
-l'd like one of those...

210
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:52,202
...that, and one of those.

211
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,912
You got money?

212
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,000
Why don't I just sell you
the whole store for that?

213
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:01,920
Yeah, and I'll throw in my wife
and kids, too.

214
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,839
Get lost.

215
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,095
David!

216
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:40,685
Mother...

217
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,148
If you'd ever listen to me,
this kind of thing wouldn't happen.

218
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,609
Look, just calm down.
We can't be that far from a gas station.

219
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,611
I'm not going to go hiking off
when we don't know where we're going.

220
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,030
I don't even have the right shose on.

221
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,534
Excuse me, young man?

222
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,868
We need some help.

223
00:33:58,035 --> 00:33:59,495
Do you know if there's a gas station
around here?

224
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,039
The kid's not gonna speak English.
Use your Italian.

225
00:34:02,164 --> 00:34:03,040
Right.

226
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:21,267
My wine shop needs steak.

227
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,895
My wine shop needs steak.

228
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:30,276
No?

229
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,194
My wine shop needs steak?

230
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,572
I saw a place back there where
they do that.

231
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,992
Oh, you speak English. Great.

232
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:42,121
Would you go get us some gas?
I'll give you a tip if you do.

233
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,580
Yes, sir.

234
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:27,374
Sir...

235
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:29,918
...l'd like to buy some things.

236
00:36:42,448 --> 00:36:43,491
Hey!

237
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,870
What are you doing on my property?
Think you're gonna steal something?

238
00:36:53,209 --> 00:36:54,460
Come on and fight me!

239
00:36:56,295 --> 00:36:58,297
What's this? Something else you stole?

240
00:36:58,464 --> 00:37:01,884
-Give me that, that's mine.
-Oh, yeah? I think it's mine now.

241
00:37:05,471 --> 00:37:07,807
Go ahead and run, little piggy!

242
00:37:07,932 --> 00:37:09,350
And don't ever come back!

243
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:02,444
Johannes...

244
00:38:05,656 --> 00:38:07,616
...I want to escape.

245
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:14,957
You said that if we weren't dead,
we could change things.

246
00:38:15,082 --> 00:38:18,126
But how do we know
they're going to let us live?

247
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:19,211
We don't.

248
00:38:19,336 --> 00:38:21,797
Then we should leave while we still can.

249
00:38:21,922 --> 00:38:26,051
-They'd kill us if we tried.
-They're going to kill us anyway.

250
00:38:26,218 --> 00:38:29,680
We should do whatever
we can to stay alive.

251
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:32,224
That's what you said.

252
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,813
You're scared.

253
00:38:38,397 --> 00:38:39,606
Yes.

254
00:38:40,357 --> 00:38:41,399
I am.

255
00:38:41,817 --> 00:38:45,237
I don't want to be scared anymore,
Johannes.

256
00:38:46,947 --> 00:38:48,949
Neither do I.

257
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:05,090
Garlo! Help!

258
00:39:09,177 --> 00:39:11,262
Help!

259
00:39:13,056 --> 00:39:15,016
Help!

260
00:39:22,816 --> 00:39:24,234
Help!

261
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:30,990
Don't breathe!

262
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:02,980
I love you, David.

263
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:15,451
Are you awake?

264
00:40:16,535 --> 00:40:17,662
I was watching you.

265
00:40:17,787 --> 00:40:20,373
I wanted to make sure
you were all right.

266
00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:23,542
How long have I been asleep?

267
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:25,419
Since yesterday.

268
00:40:25,544 --> 00:40:27,546
You must have been tired.

269
00:40:27,671 --> 00:40:30,382
When the doctor came,
you didn't even waske up.

270
00:40:30,508 --> 00:40:32,802
Mother put you under the covers.

271
00:40:33,427 --> 00:40:35,679
Where's my bundle?

272
00:40:35,805 --> 00:40:38,182
What bundle?

273
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:42,520
Nothing. I was just confused.

274
00:40:42,728 --> 00:40:44,271
You got burned...

275
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,690
...but not very bad.

276
00:40:46,815 --> 00:40:49,485
I got burned, too. See?

277
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:53,280
Mine weren't bad, either,
but Cecha and Angelo are in trouble.

278
00:40:53,447 --> 00:40:55,991
Papa made them go the bed
without supper...

279
00:40:56,116 --> 00:40:59,161
...because they weren't supposed
to be playing with fire.

280
00:41:00,662 --> 00:41:02,623
What's your name?

281
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:07,836
-David.
-I'm Maria.

282
00:41:08,712 --> 00:41:10,964
Thank you for saving me, David.

283
00:41:11,548 --> 00:41:13,133
Papa said I could have died.

284
00:41:14,635 --> 00:41:16,345
You could have, too.

285
00:41:16,803 --> 00:41:18,764
You're very brave.

286
00:41:24,102 --> 00:41:26,688
Did I just smile at you?

287
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,650
Yes. How come?

288
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,860
I don't know.

289
00:41:31,985 --> 00:41:34,488
Is it because you think I look funny?

290
00:41:34,613 --> 00:41:35,822
No.

291
00:41:35,947 --> 00:41:39,284
Then myabe you love me.

292
00:41:40,243 --> 00:41:42,037
You're awake.

293
00:41:42,162 --> 00:41:43,955
Maria, did you wake him up?

294
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:45,749
I told you not to.

295
00:41:46,374 --> 00:41:50,337
His name is David, Mama,
and he woke up on his own.

296
00:41:50,504 --> 00:41:52,047
Didn't you?

297
00:41:53,215 --> 00:41:56,927
Go downstairs and get ready for lunch.
David will be down in a minute.

298
00:41:57,093 --> 00:41:58,678
Yes, Mama.

299
00:42:05,644 --> 00:42:07,896
You saved my Maria.

300
00:42:08,438 --> 00:42:09,606
For this...

301
00:42:09,773 --> 00:42:12,108
...I owe you my life.

302
00:42:15,028 --> 00:42:16,821
Are you feeling okay?

303
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:21,117
We have to get hold of your parents now
that you're awake.

304
00:42:21,242 --> 00:42:22,869
They must be very worried.

305
00:42:23,036 --> 00:42:26,790
We've been asking around,
but no one knows where you're from.

306
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,209
They won't be worried about me.

307
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:33,671
I don't live around here.
I'm on my way somewhere.

308
00:42:33,796 --> 00:42:35,089
By yourself?

309
00:42:35,798 --> 00:42:37,634
Where are you going?

310
00:42:39,844 --> 00:42:41,763
Lunch is ready, senora.

311
00:42:42,138 --> 00:42:43,222
Thank you, Julia.

312
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,560
Well...

313
00:42:48,019 --> 00:42:50,063
...if you're away from home...

314
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,691
...then I want you to stay
with us for a few days.

315
00:42:53,816 --> 00:42:56,652
The doctor said you should rest
and let your burns heal.

316
00:42:56,819 --> 00:43:00,239
I have brought you
some of Carlo's old clothes.

317
00:43:00,656 --> 00:43:03,493
Now, get dressed and come downstaris.

318
00:43:03,659 --> 00:43:06,120
We've made a special lunch
in your honor.

319
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:08,831
Everyone's dying to meet you.

320
00:43:45,451 --> 00:43:47,870
I just wanted to tell you I was sorry.

321
00:43:48,162 --> 00:43:50,497
I didn't mean to beat you up yesterday.

322
00:43:51,874 --> 00:43:55,586
Look, I thought you were one
of the boys who stole Maria's bike.

323
00:43:55,878 --> 00:43:58,547
You probably would have done
the same thing, right?

324
00:43:58,756 --> 00:44:01,342
-No.
-Carlo, come down to lunch!

325
00:44:01,508 --> 00:44:04,428
-I called you 5 minutes ago!
-Coming.

326
00:44:05,095 --> 00:44:07,848
Please don't tell my parents
what happened yesterday, okay?

327
00:44:07,973 --> 00:44:09,683
I didn't mean it, I swear.

328
00:44:09,808 --> 00:44:11,185
All right?

329
00:44:14,563 --> 00:44:15,856
Thanks.

330
00:44:15,981 --> 00:44:17,024
Come on.

331
00:44:40,964 --> 00:44:46,094
David, my name is Giovanni Rescigno
and I'm Maria's father.

332
00:44:46,261 --> 00:44:48,972
It's n honor to hv you here in our home.

333
00:44:51,266 --> 00:44:55,562
David, come over here.
Maria wants you to sit next to her.

334
00:44:57,272 --> 00:44:59,399
Maria, I know it's your turn
to say grace...

335
00:44:59,524 --> 00:45:03,904
...but it you don't mind,
l'd like to say it today.

336
00:45:06,823 --> 00:45:08,366
Dear God, we thank you...

337
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:11,953
...for this wonderful food
of which we're about to partake...

338
00:45:12,078 --> 00:45:15,290
...and for all the bounty
which you provide for us.

339
00:45:15,415 --> 00:45:19,294
We especially want to thank you
for sending us David...

340
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:21,838
...whose bravery and selflessness...

341
00:45:21,963 --> 00:45:25,925
...has kept our dearest Maria safe
and well.

342
00:45:26,301 --> 00:45:31,264
Please bless David
and our little family...

343
00:45:31,764 --> 00:45:36,477
...and guide us so that we may continue
to perform your good works.

344
00:45:36,644 --> 00:45:38,813
Thank you so very much.

345
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,940
Amen.

346
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:46,195
Well, David, I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

347
00:45:46,654 --> 00:45:48,072
Let's eat.

348
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,842
It's okay, David?

349
00:46:55,139 --> 00:46:57,057
Is it nice to have a family?

350
00:46:58,851 --> 00:47:00,477
I like it...

351
00:47:01,103 --> 00:47:03,939
...but I don't know anyone
who doesn't have one.

352
00:47:04,481 --> 00:47:05,983
Don't you have a family?

353
00:47:06,442 --> 00:47:09,403
I don't know, but l'd like one.

354
00:47:10,696 --> 00:47:12,656
We can be your family.

355
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:15,492
You can be an honorary memeber.

356
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:27,963
Do you like your brother Carlo?

357
00:47:28,088 --> 00:47:31,049
Yes, but he makes fun of me a lot.

358
00:47:31,174 --> 00:47:35,637
He calls me "crybaby",
but I don't cry as much as I used to.

359
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:38,181
Don't you like him?

360
00:47:38,473 --> 00:47:40,726
There's a lot of people I don't like.

361
00:47:40,851 --> 00:47:42,269
Why not?

362
00:47:43,603 --> 00:47:47,024
Becuase the world is filled
with terrible people, Maria...

363
00:47:47,524 --> 00:47:50,402
...and they all do terrible,
evil things.

364
00:47:51,528 --> 00:47:53,071
I've seen them.

365
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,783
You don't think that
we are terrible people, do you?

366
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,328
-No, not at all.
-Not even Carlo?

367
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:07,127
Let's go inside.
I want to show you something.

368
00:48:07,502 --> 00:48:10,297
My papa has lots of poetry books.

369
00:48:10,463 --> 00:48:12,716
He reads to me from them.

370
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,287
Shakespeare is my favorite.

371
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:45,164
Do you like Shakespeare's sonnets?

372
00:48:45,665 --> 00:48:47,500
I've never heard them.

373
00:48:48,001 --> 00:48:50,336
You don't know anything good...

374
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:51,504
...do you?

375
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:56,301
What's that?

376
00:48:58,761 --> 00:49:00,263
That's the Earth.

377
00:49:02,015 --> 00:49:05,101
I've never seen a map like this before.

378
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:07,186
Do you know how to read it?

379
00:49:07,353 --> 00:49:08,312
Uh-huh.

380
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:11,774
That's Italy...

381
00:49:11,899 --> 00:49:13,401
...and there is Russia...

382
00:49:13,526 --> 00:49:15,528
...and there's America.

383
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:17,697
Where's Denmark?

384
00:49:19,949 --> 00:49:21,701
That's up here.

385
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:26,122
Switzerland and Germany
are between them and us.

386
00:49:26,372 --> 00:49:30,960
-Have you ever been to Denmark?
-No. Have you?

387
00:49:32,545 --> 00:49:34,505
I'm on my way there now.

388
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:36,799
You are?
Why are you going to Denmark, David?

389
00:49:37,008 --> 00:49:41,679
You know you're not supposed to be
in here without Papa's permission.

390
00:49:41,804 --> 00:49:44,640
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to read David some poetry.

391
00:49:44,765 --> 00:49:45,850
All right.

392
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,686
Why don't you go and cut some flowers
for the dinner table?

393
00:49:48,811 --> 00:49:52,231
-Can David help me?
-No, let David stay here.

394
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,900
Papa and I want to talk to him.

395
00:50:06,245 --> 00:50:08,622
How's your hand feeling?

396
00:50:09,498 --> 00:50:10,416
Fine.

397
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:14,753
David, Gianni and I just want
to make sure everything's okay with you.

398
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,465
This morning you said
you're on your way somewhere.

399
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,092
Where are you going?

400
00:50:20,592 --> 00:50:23,095
I'm going to...

401
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,597
...to meet up with the circus.

402
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,018
The circus?

403
00:50:30,144 --> 00:50:33,105
Yes, I'm in the circus.

404
00:50:33,272 --> 00:50:35,732
And what do you do in the circus?

405
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:39,528
-Lots of thing.
-And that's where your parents are?

406
00:50:39,695 --> 00:50:41,530
Yes.

407
00:50:41,697 --> 00:50:44,533
Why are your parents letting
you travel by yourself?

408
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:49,246
-It's okay. They don't mind.
-David, are you lying to us?

409
00:50:49,371 --> 00:50:50,831
No.

410
00:50:52,165 --> 00:50:55,210
Are you lying to us?

411
00:50:55,377 --> 00:50:58,505
In this house, lies are not permitted.

412
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:01,633
-No, I swear!
-Okay.

413
00:51:01,675 --> 00:51:03,385
It's okay, David. It's okay.

414
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:06,429
We just wanted to make sure everything
was all right.

415
00:51:06,555 --> 00:51:10,517
You don't have to worry.
My goodness, we wouldn't hurt you.

416
00:51:11,643 --> 00:51:15,021
We're sorry to ask you
so many questions.

417
00:51:18,567 --> 00:51:21,361
Why don't you go
and get ready for dinner?

418
00:52:06,614 --> 00:52:08,157
You stole it.

419
00:52:12,203 --> 00:52:15,623
When no one was around,
I went into the man's office.

420
00:52:15,915 --> 00:52:18,209
do you know what they'll do to
you if they find it?

421
00:52:18,376 --> 00:52:19,460
It was in his desk.

422
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:23,131
Promise me you'll never take something
that's not yours again.

423
00:52:23,214 --> 00:52:25,258
You must promise me that.

424
00:52:31,722 --> 00:52:35,601
Who did it?
Which one of you is responsible?

425
00:52:35,726 --> 00:52:38,896
It was him. I know it.

426
00:52:39,313 --> 00:52:42,900
Shoot him. They must be taught a lesson.

427
00:52:56,372 --> 00:52:58,916
No, it was him.

428
00:53:52,803 --> 00:53:55,138
Take care of her, Saint Elizabeth.

429
00:53:55,806 --> 00:53:59,643
I don't deserve to have
you look after me anymore.

430
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,895
I don't deserve anything good.

431
00:54:10,445 --> 00:54:13,406
Please tell Maria that I'm sorry.

432
00:54:13,615 --> 00:54:16,409
And if you talk to Johannes...

433
00:54:16,535 --> 00:54:18,578
...tell him I'm sorry, too.

434
00:55:31,817 --> 00:55:34,820
-Workers of the world...
-Unite!

435
00:55:34,987 --> 00:55:41,369
-Workers of the world...
-Unite!

436
00:55:58,385 --> 00:56:00,429
That was a big mistake, boy.

437
00:56:02,723 --> 00:56:05,601
It wasn't me! I didn't throw it!

438
00:56:17,071 --> 00:56:18,239
Let me out!

439
00:57:50,705 --> 00:57:52,999
Where do you think you're going?
Come on!

440
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,170
You better stay right there, boy!

441
00:57:59,672 --> 00:58:00,715
Come back!

442
00:58:05,553 --> 00:58:05,970
Come back here!

443
00:58:06,137 --> 00:58:08,765
Where do you think you're going?
Come here!

444
00:58:11,517 --> 00:58:12,727
I'll find you, boy!

445
00:58:34,081 --> 00:58:38,044
Hey, my firiend!
I see you made it to shore. Well done.

446
00:58:38,169 --> 00:58:40,254
Roberto? Why aren't you on the ship?

447
00:58:40,421 --> 00:58:43,883
I quit. It was too boring.

448
00:58:44,008 --> 00:58:47,762
Besides, they caught me
stealing a crate of tomatoes.

449
00:58:47,887 --> 00:58:49,430
You need a ride?

450
00:58:50,014 --> 00:58:51,140
Hop in.

451
00:58:56,896 --> 00:58:59,440
Where are you going to?

452
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,401
-Denmark.
-Denmark?

453
00:59:03,444 --> 00:59:06,363
That's a long way.
I'm only going to Milan.

454
00:59:06,489 --> 00:59:10,159
-That's okay.
-I was in Denmark a few summers ago.

455
00:59:10,284 --> 00:59:14,205
It's pretty nice.
Lots of good-looking girls.

456
01:00:19,811 --> 01:00:22,689
Good-bye, my friend, and good luck.

457
01:00:22,814 --> 01:00:25,108
Say hello to Denmark for me.

458
01:01:06,733 --> 01:01:07,984
Hello.

459
01:01:08,401 --> 01:01:10,361
I thought there was somebody there.

460
01:01:10,486 --> 01:01:14,741
I always know when someone's looking
at me behind my back.

461
01:01:14,908 --> 01:01:17,994
some sort of psychic energy,
don't you think?

462
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,581
Come over and take a look at this,
will you?

463
01:01:22,707 --> 01:01:24,167
I've been trying all morning...

464
01:01:24,334 --> 01:01:27,837
...to capture the essence
of this beautiful place.

465
01:01:28,087 --> 01:01:31,257
Usually when I come up here,
it inspires me...

466
01:01:31,382 --> 01:01:35,011
...but today, nothing seems
to be working for me.

467
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,555
What do you think?

468
01:01:38,264 --> 01:01:40,725
It's very pretty.

469
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:44,061
Is it?
It all seems a bit lifeless to me.

470
01:01:47,773 --> 01:01:50,610
You've got a very interesting face.

471
01:01:50,735 --> 01:01:52,987
Would you mind if I painted it?

472
01:01:53,112 --> 01:01:55,531
What color do you want to paint
my face?

473
01:01:57,241 --> 01:01:58,075
I like that.

474
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,162
I think you'll make quite
a challenging subject.

475
01:02:01,329 --> 01:02:03,998
That is, if you don't mind
sitting for a bit.

476
01:02:04,999 --> 01:02:09,086
I'm Sophie, by the way.
What's your name?

477
01:02:09,211 --> 01:02:09,962
David.

478
01:02:10,129 --> 01:02:13,132
David? That's too perfect.

479
01:02:13,257 --> 01:02:18,220
Michelangelo had his David,
so you've got to let me have mine.

480
01:02:27,187 --> 01:02:29,607
You're very good at sitting still,
David.

481
01:02:29,732 --> 01:02:34,611
Most aduIts I paint can't sit still
for a minute without fidgeting.

482
01:02:35,446 --> 01:02:37,573
I always tell them the more they move...

483
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:40,451
...the worse they look in the picture.

484
01:02:43,162 --> 01:02:45,622
But that doesn't mean
you can't move your mouth.

485
01:02:45,748 --> 01:02:49,585
Talking won't ruin the painting.
I'm not that bad.

486
01:02:50,002 --> 01:02:52,296
I don't really have anything to say.

487
01:02:52,421 --> 01:02:54,673
Well, then you don't have
to say anything.

488
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,259
There are an awful lot of people
in this world...

489
01:02:57,342 --> 01:02:58,677
...who have nothing to say,

490
01:02:58,802 --> 01:03:01,680
but seem to spend
all their time talking.

491
01:03:02,556 --> 01:03:05,726
You're right to conserve your words.

492
01:03:05,851 --> 01:03:08,604
It means you'll be a man
with great power.

493
01:03:08,729 --> 01:03:10,897
I don't want to be a man of great power.

494
01:03:11,023 --> 01:03:14,318
Then you don't have to be.

495
01:03:16,194 --> 01:03:21,033
Just be happy that you're the kind
of person who could be if he wanted to.

496
01:03:23,869 --> 01:03:25,787
I'm having such trouble...

497
01:03:25,871 --> 01:03:28,206
...with your eyes.

498
01:03:28,748 --> 01:03:32,252
I've never had to use
so much black paint before.

499
01:03:33,044 --> 01:03:36,715
Such serious eyes.

500
01:03:39,384 --> 01:03:42,721
Such a serious face.

501
01:03:52,647 --> 01:03:56,317
Well, just one or two more finishing
touches and then we're done.

502
01:03:57,527 --> 01:04:01,656
I wish my house was a bit closer.
l'd love to invite you to lunch...

503
01:04:01,823 --> 01:04:04,826
...to repay you for your kindness.

504
01:04:04,993 --> 01:04:06,035
Where do you live?

505
01:04:06,202 --> 01:04:09,664
Just over the border, in Switzerland.

506
01:04:13,668 --> 01:04:14,919
David...

507
01:04:15,044 --> 01:04:19,215
...are you quite sure your parents
won't mind you coming this far?

508
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,634
It's okay. They don't mind.

509
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:24,554
They don't live around here anyway.

510
01:04:25,346 --> 01:04:26,973
I see.

511
01:04:29,767 --> 01:04:31,561
What's that?

512
01:04:31,811 --> 01:04:34,272
That's just my sketchbook.

513
01:04:34,439 --> 01:04:36,649
All my drawings are in there.

514
01:04:38,234 --> 01:04:42,113
-Can I look at them, please?
-You can if you want to.

515
01:04:42,238 --> 01:04:44,782
But I warn you, they're not very good.

516
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:47,994
I went to a few art classes
when I was younger...

517
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:51,122
...but I never really kept up with it.

518
01:04:51,414 --> 01:04:54,709
I only studied painting again
a year ago.

519
01:04:54,876 --> 01:04:56,877
Just for my own amusement.

520
01:05:07,179 --> 01:05:08,597
Who's that?

521
01:05:08,723 --> 01:05:14,145
That's just a boy
I knew a long time ago.

522
01:05:15,563 --> 01:05:18,441
I told you they were not very good.

523
01:05:23,612 --> 01:05:26,657
-I have to get out.
-What?

524
01:05:26,824 --> 01:05:29,326
Is something the matter?

525
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:32,997
You can do whatever you want.
I thought you want to see Switzerland.

526
01:05:33,122 --> 01:05:35,082
I do.

527
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:42,339
Well, now...

528
01:05:42,506 --> 01:05:47,344
...they're going to ask us
for identification. Do you have any?

529
01:05:50,013 --> 01:05:52,349
-No.
-Well, it doesn't really matter.

530
01:05:52,516 --> 01:05:55,853
This is an easy border.
It shouldn't be a problem.

531
01:05:56,311 --> 01:05:58,021
Okay?

532
01:05:58,272 --> 01:05:59,523
Okay.

533
01:06:10,784 --> 01:06:13,120
-Good day, ma'am.
-Good morning.

534
01:06:13,245 --> 01:06:15,872
-Your papers, please.
-Yes, of course.

535
01:06:22,337 --> 01:06:26,341
-And for the boy also.
-This is my grandson, officer...

536
01:06:26,466 --> 01:06:29,928
...and we left the house in such
a hurry this morning...

537
01:06:30,053 --> 01:06:33,557
...he forgot
to bring his identification.

538
01:06:36,017 --> 01:06:37,853
I don't know.

539
01:06:37,978 --> 01:06:41,606
Our orders are to check
everyone's papers, even children.

540
01:06:43,483 --> 01:06:47,028
Couldn't you relax the rules for a bit?

541
01:06:47,195 --> 01:06:49,406
All he wants to do is to come
into your country...

542
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:54,411
...overthrow the government
and then rush right out again.

543
01:06:58,164 --> 01:07:02,168
All right, Mrs. Anderson.
Have a nice day.

544
01:07:02,836 --> 01:07:04,087
And young man...

545
01:07:04,212 --> 01:07:09,592
...see if you can get us pay raises
while you're taking over our country.

546
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:21,854
There, you see? No problem.

547
01:07:22,021 --> 01:07:24,190
Now we can go and have some lunch.

548
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:35,618
I'm afraid there's
no escaping my artwork.

549
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:39,122
But it's less expensive
than buying real paintings.

550
01:07:39,247 --> 01:07:41,374
They look like real paintings to me.

551
01:07:41,499 --> 01:07:43,042
But wait a minute.

552
01:07:43,209 --> 01:07:47,630
We have to add my latest work
to the gallery wall.

553
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:49,882
Hold it a minute, would you?

554
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:55,888
Thank you.

555
01:08:07,233 --> 01:08:08,985
Is that what I look like?

556
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:13,114
To me, yes. It's my impression of you.

557
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:17,243
That's why
it's called impressionistic painting.

558
01:08:17,868 --> 01:08:19,995
So...

559
01:08:21,622 --> 01:08:24,834
...what do you see when you look at it?

560
01:08:26,752 --> 01:08:28,420
Me?

561
01:08:28,587 --> 01:08:33,050
Well, yes.
That's not quite what I meant.

562
01:08:33,259 --> 01:08:36,136
you have to look
at paintings differently...

563
01:08:36,262 --> 01:08:39,306
...from the way
you look at other things.

564
01:08:39,431 --> 01:08:41,350
More closely...

565
01:08:41,475 --> 01:08:45,020
...to see what it says to you.

566
01:08:53,821 --> 01:08:55,155
Well...

567
01:08:56,281 --> 01:08:59,827
...when I look at the boy
in that painting...

568
01:08:59,993 --> 01:09:04,873
...I see a very intelligent,
very serious person...

569
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,000
...and a good person.

570
01:09:07,125 --> 01:09:09,002
But...

571
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:14,550
...ther's something about the eyes...

572
01:09:14,675 --> 01:09:20,055
...and the face that seems lost and sad.

573
01:09:20,597 --> 01:09:23,350
But that's as far as I can see...

574
01:09:23,475 --> 01:09:29,022
...because he doesn't want to
let the world see any further.

575
01:09:29,147 --> 01:09:33,735
-Do you really see all that?
-Yes. Yes, I do.

576
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:39,366
Oops, there's our tea.

577
01:09:47,123 --> 01:09:51,086
I hope there's enough food for you.
I'm a very light eater...

578
01:09:51,211 --> 01:09:54,339
...but I know boys
can pack away quite a lot.

579
01:09:54,506 --> 01:09:56,967
I'm fine. It's very nice. Thank you.

580
01:09:57,133 --> 01:09:58,218
Good.

581
01:09:59,302 --> 01:10:02,931
Hello, Annette.
I thought you might smell our food.

582
01:10:03,056 --> 01:10:05,892
Or have you come to say hello
to our guest?

583
01:10:06,393 --> 01:10:08,269
Do you like cats?

584
01:10:08,436 --> 01:10:10,438
I don't know. I guess so.

585
01:10:10,647 --> 01:10:13,400
Well, if you knew Annette, you would.

586
01:10:13,525 --> 01:10:18,696
She's very sweet and also very funny,
aren't you, pussycat?

587
01:10:18,863 --> 01:10:20,365
What's that?

588
01:10:21,032 --> 01:10:22,951
What?

589
01:10:23,117 --> 01:10:24,577
This?

590
01:10:25,954 --> 01:10:27,956
It's a locket.

591
01:10:28,456 --> 01:10:32,835
I've had it for ages.
It belonged to my mother.

592
01:10:33,628 --> 01:10:35,171
And look, I'll show you.

593
01:10:35,338 --> 01:10:39,217
My father had it inscribed on the back.

594
01:10:40,885 --> 01:10:44,889
He gave it to her on their wedding day.

595
01:10:50,061 --> 01:10:53,231
Is that the same boy that you drew?

596
01:10:54,607 --> 01:10:56,567
Yes.

597
01:10:57,568 --> 01:11:00,905
That's my son, Peter.

598
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:04,784
Or he was my son.

599
01:11:05,535 --> 01:11:11,040
He died not long after that picture
was taken.

600
01:11:11,707 --> 01:11:15,503
-What happened?
-Pneumonia.

601
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:18,923
He'd always been a frail child...

602
01:11:19,048 --> 01:11:23,177
...but he was a very sweet,
very loving boy.

603
01:11:23,427 --> 01:11:25,179
Did he live here with you?

604
01:11:25,346 --> 01:11:29,517
No, we all lived in Zurich then. But...

605
01:11:29,642 --> 01:11:32,269
...some other things happened...

606
01:11:32,436 --> 01:11:34,897
...after Peter died and...

607
01:11:35,022 --> 01:11:37,816
...and I decided to move up here.

608
01:11:37,942 --> 01:11:42,738
And besides,
who wouldn't want to live up here?

609
01:11:43,072 --> 01:11:46,659
It's such a beautiful place,
don't you think?

610
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:50,079
We think so, don't we, pussycat?

611
01:11:52,498 --> 01:11:54,958
Would you like to hold her?

612
01:11:55,125 --> 01:11:58,045
-She won't bite.
-Okay.

613
01:12:04,384 --> 01:12:06,303
She's so soft.

614
01:12:08,055 --> 01:12:09,598
And she's vibrating.

615
01:12:09,765 --> 01:12:12,559
She's purring, David.

616
01:12:12,726 --> 01:12:15,646
Have you never stroked a cat before?

617
01:12:15,979 --> 01:12:17,356
No.

618
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:34,498
Where do you live, David?

619
01:12:53,058 --> 01:12:54,476
Nowhere.

620
01:12:57,938 --> 01:12:59,606
I'm in the circus.

621
01:13:00,023 --> 01:13:01,858
In the circus?

622
01:13:02,025 --> 01:13:05,779
Oh, my goodness.
That must be very interesting.

623
01:13:05,945 --> 01:13:08,740
Yes, it is. It's very interesting.

624
01:13:09,115 --> 01:13:11,576
If you need a place to stay the night...

625
01:13:11,701 --> 01:13:14,704
-...you're very welcome to stay here.
-No.

626
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:18,625
I can't. I have to go.
I can't stay anywhere anymore.

627
01:13:18,792 --> 01:13:22,378
David, if there's something
troubling you...

628
01:13:22,545 --> 01:13:25,799
...l'd very much like to help you
if I can.

629
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,387
Please...

630
01:13:31,554 --> 01:13:34,807
-...don't turn me in.
-Turn you in to whom?

631
01:13:34,933 --> 01:13:36,392
To them.

632
01:13:36,851 --> 01:13:38,811
To him, to anyone.

633
01:13:38,978 --> 01:13:43,358
I wouldn't dream of turning you
in to anybody for any reason.

634
01:13:43,483 --> 01:13:47,737
You're quite safe here, David.
You're safe.

635
01:13:48,196 --> 01:13:50,782
From the guards?

636
01:13:51,282 --> 01:13:53,868
From everybody.

637
01:13:54,285 --> 01:13:58,456
I want to tell you everything,
Sophie, but I can't.

638
01:13:58,581 --> 01:13:59,999
I just can't.

639
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:03,544
You don't have to tell me anything.

640
01:14:03,669 --> 01:14:06,506
I just want you to know that
you're safe here...

641
01:14:06,631 --> 01:14:09,592
...and that everything
will be all right.

642
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:30,613
Sleep well, David.

643
01:14:30,905 --> 01:14:33,324
Everything's all right.

644
01:15:16,325 --> 01:15:20,412
Good morning, David.
I hope I didn't wake you.

645
01:15:21,955 --> 01:15:24,041
I have to go to the village.

646
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:27,753
I promised to take some food
to a friend of mine who's sick.

647
01:15:28,337 --> 01:15:31,590
You can come along if you want to.

648
01:15:37,346 --> 01:15:41,016
Why do people do such terrible things?

649
01:15:41,808 --> 01:15:43,935
Like what?

650
01:15:44,269 --> 01:15:48,732
Like beat people and kill them,
and make them prisoners.

651
01:15:49,316 --> 01:15:52,569
Most people don't do that.

652
01:16:00,202 --> 01:16:03,288
My friend Johannes always used
to tell me...

653
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,707
..."trust no one."

654
01:16:05,832 --> 01:16:09,961
Life wouldn't be worth living
if you did that, David.

655
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:16,217
You can be cautious,
but you have to let people in.

656
01:16:16,551 --> 01:16:20,388
How do you know if they're bad or not?

657
01:16:20,513 --> 01:16:25,643
David, most people are good.

658
01:16:26,102 --> 01:16:29,939
They have families and friends...

659
01:16:30,064 --> 01:16:34,652
...and they just want to live their
lives as happily as they can.

660
01:16:34,819 --> 01:16:39,115
There will always be bad people
in this world...

661
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:42,952
...and you'll usually know
them when you meet them...

662
01:16:43,077 --> 01:16:45,163
...but sometimes you won't.

663
01:16:47,165 --> 01:16:49,834
But you can't let that stop you from...

664
01:16:50,001 --> 01:16:54,297
...living your life fully and freely...

665
01:16:54,422 --> 01:16:57,008
...and making friends...

666
01:16:57,175 --> 01:17:00,887
...and seeing the goodness in people.

667
01:17:01,012 --> 01:17:05,600
Because if you don't do that,
you'll never find any happiness.

668
01:17:13,524 --> 01:17:17,028
Now this is my friend's house.

669
01:17:17,278 --> 01:17:19,655
But you don't need to come in, David.

670
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:24,368
Why don't you go exploring?
Look around some of the shops.

671
01:17:24,535 --> 01:17:29,415
I'll meet you in the bookshop
in a little while, okay?

672
01:17:33,627 --> 01:17:36,297
They're nice people, David.

673
01:17:36,422 --> 01:17:39,300
You don't have to worry about anything.

674
01:17:39,467 --> 01:17:40,801
Okay?

675
01:19:51,472 --> 01:19:52,682
Hello.

676
01:19:54,976 --> 01:19:56,811
And hello to you.

677
01:21:02,626 --> 01:21:06,046
You must do everything I just told you
if you want to escape.

678
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:08,173
They're moving
me to another camp tomorrow...

679
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:11,176
...and I can no longer watch over you.

680
01:21:12,761 --> 01:21:15,848
This is the only way
you'll ever be safe.

681
01:21:16,181 --> 01:21:18,142
Do you understand?

682
01:21:19,017 --> 01:21:21,603
I know you've lived in this camp
your entire life...

683
01:21:21,812 --> 01:21:24,523
...but there is a world outside it.

684
01:21:24,648 --> 01:21:29,278
However, it's a very dangerous world.
Trust no one.

685
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:32,906
And...

686
01:21:33,031 --> 01:21:35,617
...I'm sorry about your friend Johannes.

687
01:23:17,969 --> 01:23:22,557
I've seen this bood before.

688
01:23:23,891 --> 01:23:25,560
What is it?

689
01:23:26,978 --> 01:23:29,605
That's a wonderful book, David.

690
01:23:29,772 --> 01:23:33,985
It was written by a woman
who lost her husband and her son...

691
01:23:34,151 --> 01:23:36,737
...in Bulgaria after the war.

692
01:23:36,862 --> 01:23:38,864
The husband came from England.

693
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:40,574
When he went to Bulgaria

694
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:42,451
to rouse people against
the communists...

695
01:23:42,576 --> 01:23:45,705
...he took her and the boy with him.

696
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:49,875
But they were all arrested,
and the man and the boy were killed.

697
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,336
But one of the guards
had known the woman...

698

and helped her to escape.

-Yes. She lives in Denmark.

01:27:09,156 --> 01:27:11,075
I am David.

702
01:27:12,952 --> 01:27:15,037
I know, David.

703
01:27:15,162 --> 01:27:17,122
