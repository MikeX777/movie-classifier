00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,100
Anna,

2
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,980
this isn't the first time

3
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,900
I've addressed you this way.

4
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,540
In 2014,

5
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,500
I told you
about a film I wanted to make,

6
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,620
as brief and clear as a gesture.

7
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,500
I made it,

8
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,100
but, in the end,
it was long and complicated.

9
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,860
The film was dedicated to you.

10
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,580
I know you haven't seen it.
That doesn't matter.

11
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,740
You turned 18 this year,

12
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,220
more or less the age of the characters.

13
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,660
A year that we spent in lockdown,

14
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,940
on hold, forced to reflect on our lives.

15
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,420
The present has come to a halt,

16
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,580
leaving us the past and the future.

17
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,980
We think once more
about all our experiences

18
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,580
and all we have been through.

19
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,140
What we have built,
our successes and failures.

20
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,820
What we have acquired

21
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,100
and what we have lost.

22
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,820
About those we have lost.

23
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,580
Those who have died
and those who are missing.

24
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,020
Our vanished loves.

25
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,740
The felling of loss is dreadful

26
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,100
because it is incomprehensible.

27
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,620
Yet, at the same time,

28
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,700
it is magnificent in its depth.

29
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,020
In this lockdown,
silence would have been nice.

30
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,220
Everyone has something to say,

31
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,460
but what can we really do?

32
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,820
A gesture, probably.

33
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,860
The strongest,

34
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,620
the craziest,

35
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,700
the most violent, the most beautiful.

36
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,580
Like love.

37
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,980
But we can't always
imagine this gesture.

38
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,740
So we start dreaming of films again.

39
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,940
That makes you think about time,

40
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,340
about the perception
of things over time.

41
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,980
Take your time.
Do nut surrender to the current mood.

42
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,700
That will be your liberty.

43
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,100
And I repeat to you, as seven years ago,

44
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,980
that even if winter is long and harsh,

45
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,380
spring always returns.

46
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,620
And that's why we keep going.

47
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,530
Because there's always a rebirth.

48
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,260
NOCTURAMA, which was dedicated to you,

49
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,140
may have seemed full of despair,

50
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,580
but it too
carried this rebirth within it.

51
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,020
This new film

52
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,700
is my own little gesture today.

53
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,300
A gesture towards you, my love.

54
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,348
<i>This will be my sorrow
and I must bear it alone.</i>

55
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:31,340
<i>I hug you in my</i>

56
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,920
Hello and welcome to my channel,
Patricia Coma's channel.

57
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,000
A channel to help you live better.

58
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,960
Living better means living longer.

59
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,440
Living longer means

60
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,920
a better chance of understanding things.

61
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,840
As the Romanian philosopher Cioran said:

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,520
"It's no use killing oneself
As one always does it too late."

63
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,040
Music, please.

64
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,600
<i>The weather with Patricia Coma</i>

65
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:23,030
I don't know where you live,
but you do.

66
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,400
Look at the map behind me.

67
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,640
Find your home
and you'll know the weather tomorrow.

68
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,200
If you live in northern France,

69
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,880
it will be about 48°C in the afternoon.

70
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,040
If you live in Nice, like me,

71
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,600
it will be 61°C.

72
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,200
You can't go out anyway,
so never mind.

73
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,480
Hi, Tess, I'm busy now.

74
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,560
Can I call you later?
OK, bye.

75
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,760
(Gilles Deleuze)
The dream that people have

76
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,240
is always a devouring dream
that threatens to engulf us.

77
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,440
The fact that others dream
is very dangerous.

78
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,640
A dream is an overwhelming desire
for power.

79
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,040
And each one of us is more or less

80
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,520
the victim of others' dreaming,

81
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,640
even the most graceful young girl's.

82
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,400
The most graceful young girl can

83
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,320
be a voracious ghoul.

84
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,720
Not through her soul,
but through her dreams.

85
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,650
Beware of other's dreaming

86
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,640
because if you're caught in it,
you're finished.

87
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,400
Never get caught in another's dream.

88
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,800
I need to be honest
and tell you something.

89
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,600
Tell me what?

90
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,000
It's hard to say this.
I don't know how.

91
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,080
It's about Scott.

92
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,400
He had and accident?

93
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,200
No, he's fine, but you won't like it.

94
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,160
I don't understand. What is this?

95
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,520
I'm sorry to have to tell you.

96
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,160
Stop, you're worrying me.
What's wrong?

97
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,720
The other evening,

98
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
I saw him kiss another woman.

99
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,440
What?

100
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,800
No.

101
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,160
It's true.

102
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,240
Who was it?

103
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,760
It doesn't matter.
We don't care who she was, ok.

104
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,520
He's cheating on you.

105
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,200
I find it hard to believe,
coming from you.

106
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,560
Sharon, I'd never have made up
such a thing.

107
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
No, but it suits you.

108
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,040
You come here accusing him,

109
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,040
Yet won't say who she is.

110
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,400
I saw them, I didn't imagine it.

111
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,800
He cheated on you. I came to tell you

112
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,680
because I worry about you.

113
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,520
I weighed the pros and cons all night.

114
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,120
But I felt you had a right to the truth.

115
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,280
Is knowing the truth a good thing?

116
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,560
Frankly, I'm not so sure.

117
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,960
It can be better to suffer one hour
than every hour.

118
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,040
I don't know.

119
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,640
What would you do in my shoes?

120
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,400
Hello and welcome to my channel.

121
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,040
Patricia Coma's channel,

122
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,520
A channel to help you live better.

123
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,280
I'll talk now about something

124
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,600
I especially cherish:
the Revelator.

125
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,160
It's a small square device
with four luminous pads.

126
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,680
One red, one blue, one green
and one yellow.

127
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,480
It's a game.

128
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,160
The rules are simple:

129
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,760
Just repeat the colour sequence
that appears and vanishes

130
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,560
by pressing
the pads that have just lit up.

131
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,760
Most people find it useful

132
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,450
as it exercises the memory.

133
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,280
And it can be played alone,
an advantage today.

134
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,840
As it's easy at first,
that encourages you to continue.

135
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,560
Win.

136
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,520
Win.

137
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,800
Win.

138
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,560
Win.

139
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
Win.

140
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
Win.

141
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,810
On continuing, you realize
even if you're distracted,

142
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,320
even if you're not sure,

143
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,080
You're never mistaken.

144
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,280
Win.

145
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,040
You can't be caught out.

146
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,840
You feel almost invincible.

147
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,800
You self-confidence is boundless.

148
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,760
Then you'll wonder
what is really happening.

149
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,240
You can't get it wrong
even if you want to.

150
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,000
How is that possible?

151
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,520
To prove you aren't winning by chance,

152
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,000
you try to force a mistake.

153
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,960
But it can't be done.

154
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,720
You always press the right colour.

155
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,840
At that point, you begin to have doubts.

156
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,440
Not in yourself, as you keep winning,

157
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,440
but in the fact that the Revelator
is simply showing

158
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,840
you don't control your choices

159
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,520
and free will doesn't exist.

160
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,600
Don't be afraid.

161
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Look.

162
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,880
I'm not afraid,
with a thousand reasons to be,

163
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,000
a thousand decisions to make.

164
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,360
What will I do about Scott?

165
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,920
Leaving him terrifies me.

166
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,480
So I force myself not to be afraid.

167
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,440
I try my hardest.
I control myself

168
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,200
What are you going to do?

169
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,480
What are you going do?

170
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't know.

171
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,400
I love Scott.

172
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,200
Maybe I should turn a blind eye.

173
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,080
And suffer in silence?

174
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,160
I could never leave him.

175
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,240
It would be too painful.
A world collapsing.

176
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,040
Do you think he's really in love

177
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,120
or is it just a fling?
-I don't know.

178
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,440
I can't leave him.

179
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,720
I think he would kill me.

180
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,520
Even telling him seems impossible.

181
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,000
It can be better to suffer one hour
than every hour.

182
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,600
I don't know.

183
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
What would you do in my shoes?

184
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,880
I don't know.

185
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,080
The Revelator is simply proving to you

186
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,400
you don't control your choices

187
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,200
and free will doesn't exist.

188
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,000
How's it going?

189
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,280
I'm fine.

190
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,360
-I had a really weird dream.
-Shit, so did I.

191
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,280
-What was it?
-You first.

192
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,160
-No, go on.
-You first.

193
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,360
I was in the wood, I was walking...

194
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,320
Never get caught in another's dream.

195
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,320
I know I'm here for you German class,
but I got swamped.

196
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,760
I've taken on too many things,

197
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,720
but I don't want to give any up.

198
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,360
But I have one quality.

199
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,240
I can do two things at once:
Answer my fans' questions

200
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,000
and give you a German lesson.

201
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,540
Daphné from Toulouse asks me,

202
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,060
"How can we reach limbo?"

203
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,860
The first way to reach limbo

204
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,740
is to pile up enough levels,

205
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,380
to sink deeper into the spirit,

206
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,650
in order to attain a state

207
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,660
where only the raw subconscious remains,

208
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,740
disconnected from reality.

209
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,410
<i>Patrcia,
I have an important question for you.</i>

210
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,810
<i>But it's a personal one.</i>

211
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,940
<i>Could you possibly answer me in private?</i>

212
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,180
<i>I am currently
full of doubt and anxiety, and</i>

213
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,440
-Ready?
-Yes.

214
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,800
Go on.

215
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,400
Win.

216
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,160
-You see.
-Try it again.

217
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,520
Win.

218
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,320
You're the devil.

219
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,440
I've thought it over.

220
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,600
I'll talk to Scott.
-You'll leave him?

221
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,400
Winning's sole interest
lies in losing.

222
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,120
You want to lose, at least once.
But you can't

223
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,000
First, you feel disappointment.
Playing isn't fun.

224
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Then anxiety.You want to stop playing.

225
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,320
Then emptiness.
You want nothing anymore

226
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,200
The only question that interests you is:

227
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
"How is it possible?"

228
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,760
The first possibility,
if you win each time,

229
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,520
is simply that the colour combination

230
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,400
offered by the Revelator

231
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,760
matches your thought pattern
as you play.

232
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,640
Each sequence
is a phototherapeutic transcription

233
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,080
of your association of ideas.

234
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,320
You simply follow your thoughts

235
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,800
and so win,
as they're yours.

236
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,040
The second possibility is that,

237
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,480
without realizing,

238
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,040
you're under hypnosis.

239
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,600
Hypnosis is a way to attain limbo,

240
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,480
to allow your brain to reach a level
that you cannot control.

241
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,080
You're able to do things

242
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,080
you could not do normally.

243
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,920
Patricia?

244
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,560
-Are you lost?
-Yes.

245
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,360
Let's go that way.
It's dangerous here.

246
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,520
What's your name?

247
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,040
What are you doing here?

248
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,600
I don't know.

249
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,680
What do you usually do?

250
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,680
I pass the time doing nothing much.

251
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,280
Do you have friends?

252
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,200
Yes, but we rarely see each other.

253
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,760
How do you feel?

254
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,920
I'm a bit scared.

255
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,760
Then again, there are reasons to be,
with terrorism,

256
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,900
ecology, the economy.
The future is scary.

257
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,600
Obviously, but I've always known that.

258
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,600
You live with it.
That's true.

259
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,600
What did you want to ask in private?

260
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I wanted to know...
I don't know...

261
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,720
It's something personal... about love...

262
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,080
But I don't dare ask.

263
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,080
Ask me when you feel ready.

264
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,200
-Bought a Revelator?
-Yes.

265
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Don't be afraid.
Bought from my channel?

266
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,480
I dunno.

267
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,000
No one but me sells them.
Know how it works?

268
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,480
Yes.

269
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,840
This is the one place it won't work.
The only one.

270
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,760
It's a bit like...

271
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,920
a place out of time.

272
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,000
We call it the Free Zone.

273
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,040
But you can play anywhere else.

274
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,120
But what's the games goal?

275
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,400
Patricia?

276
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,320
Win.

277
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,040
Be it
a thought transcription or hypnosis,

278
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,960
you are not free to choose.

279
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,520
Most people who buy a Revelator
stop choosing.

280
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,160
Some of them even come down
With catatonia.

281
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,080
They gaze at what happens,

282
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,360
but aren't part of the world.

283
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,160
They can be,
but don't want to be..

284
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,720
I'd like a romance
that no one judges.

285
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,560
That no one talks about,
that no one sees.

286
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,600
Other people's gaze is so toxic.

287
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,160
Yeah, I understand,

288
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,960
but it may not be possible.

289
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,520
I need a romance that no one judges

290
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:54,757
Not even me.

291
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,860
<i>Revelator, barely used.</i>

292
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,700
<i>Set a starting price
and let bidders compete.</i>

293
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,720
A hot soup
with vegetables that stay raw.

294
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,800
That may seem odd or absurd,

295
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,240
Unfeasible, inconsequential, futile...

296
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,440
However,
it's not odd, it's a life skill.

297
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,080
Nor absurd as it's meaningful.

298
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,360
Nor inconsequential
as I preserves vitamins,

299
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,760
And surely not futile.
as we touch the vegetable's heart.

300
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,000
The Crudimix exists,
here it is.

301
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,800
It heats raw food
with its power and its beauty.

302
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,000
It produces hot soups
with vegetables that stay raw.

303
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,960
We shall talk about production
in a coming tutorial.

304
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,080
However, no one can tell if the Crudimix

305
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,280
could grind up a human hand.

306
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,640
For a hand cannot fit
through the Crudimix's top.

307
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,940
Next week, the deeper meaning
of Michael Jackson's songs.

308
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,960
What we took for paedophilia

309
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,200
is in fact philanthropy.

310
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,760
As his song says:

311
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,440
"We are the world,
we are the children.

312
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,000
We are the ones to make a brighter day,
so let's start giving."

313
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,560
Scott, where were you?

314
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,000
-I was at the office.
-This late?

315
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
What are you imagining, Sharon?

316
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,640
I don't lie. You know I love you.

317
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,800
I'm sure there's another woman
in your life.

318
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,360
Sharon, you're the only one.

319
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,720
I saw you look at Barbara.
Don't lie.

320
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,560
I'm not lying.

321
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,760
In fact, I was thinking,

322
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,440
Robert Pattinson
should ditch Kristen Stewart.

323
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,400
She'll cheat on him again.

324
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,200
He can find better.

325
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,280
A doll cannot lose heart.

326
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,200
Only a conscious being can.

327
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,680
I could lose heart, not her.

328
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,080
We could say that deciding
to stop choosing

329
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,560
Shows we can still do so.

330
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,120
But it's not true.

331
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,740
Every form of behaviour
is compatible with determinism.

332
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,680
Why and how do things occur?

333
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,440
That's the profound question

334
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,360
that we spend our lives
trying to answer.

335
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,760
And we shall soon talk about production.

336
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,000
For now, we'll listen

337
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,280
To a Neapolitan singer,
born in Piedmont.

338
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,160
Even if he has a moustache, long hair

339
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,520
and resembles a soccer player,

340
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,880
he is able to sing
definitive things like:

341
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,360
"You are a woman, I am a man
You loved me,

342
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,240
You loved me,

343
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,960
You loved me."

344
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,240
I'll say it again:

345
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,040
every form of behaviour
is compatible with determinism.

346
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,120
(Andrea Laszlo De Simone)
-A volte

347
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,600
Perdo parti di me

348
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,680
Rimango cosi solo

349
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,720
In stati di abbandono

350
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,360
E a volte
(La mente è debole)

351
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,600
Io non sono in me
(E a volte forte come alberi)

352
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,720
Perdo la lucidità
(Dà frutti l'anima)

353
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,560
E non so più chi sono
(E il corpo muore per mangiarti)

354
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,120
Sono solo un uomo

355
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,400
Sono solo un uomo

356
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,440
Robert Pattinson
should ditch Kristen Stewart,

357
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,440
She'll cheat on him again.

358
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,520
He can find better.
-Scott, where were you?

359
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,640
I've gone from tycoon to TV star

360
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,760
to US president on my first run.

361
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm not just smart, I'm a genius
a very stable genius.

362
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,160
This late?
You're hiding something, Scott.

363
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,480
Kim Jong-un called me old,

364
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,480
but I never called him short and fat.

365
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,890
I want to be his friend,
And perhaps will be.

366
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,160
I'm sure there's another woman
in your life.

367
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,600
Kim Jong-un says the nuclear button
is on his desk.

368
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,720
Can someone in his feeble regime
tell him

369
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,320
my button is bigger, more powerful
and works?

370
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,720
Io non sono in me
(Che cadono come niente)

371
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,720
Perdo la lucidità
(L'istinto è un vento forte)

372
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,320
E non so più chi sono
(Un lupo combattente)

373
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,560
Sono solo

374
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,120
I saw you look at Barbara.
Don't lie.

375
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,000
The Chinese invented global warming

376
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,560
to make American labour uncompetitive.

377
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,040
It's cold and snowy in New York,

378
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,920
we need global warming.

379
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,000
Ma sono solo un uomo

380
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,920
Sorry, losers, my IQ is record-breaking
and you know it.

381
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,640
Don't beat yourself up.

382
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,080
It's not your fault.

383
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,660
<i>I'm going to eat your soul.</i>

384
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,820
<i>Puke it up and eat it again.</i>

385
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,680
I don't understand.

386
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,120
I'm going to eat your soul.
Puke it up and eat it again.

387
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,600
(Bonnie Banane)
-Such osmosis

388
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,680
Such harmony

389
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,160
Such symbiosis

390
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,520
Such irony

391
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,840
Such osmosis

392
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,520
Such harmony

393
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,160
Such mise en scène

394
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,800
Eternal mise en abyme

395
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,520
I watch the scene

396
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,520
I immerse myself in it

397
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,600
I observe this cascade of hair

398
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,680
As it's being combed

399
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,800
Who are the servants?

400
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,240
Who holds the reins?

401
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,240
Will some disturb

402
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,880
Our bodies as they bathe?

403
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,760
Such Osmosis

404
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,400
Such Harmony

405
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,360
Such mise en scène

406
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,840
Eternal mise en abyme

407
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,200
Add a little of this oil...

408
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,400
-Is that you?
-Yeah.

409
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,840
-It's brilliant.
-You said it.

410
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,640
I never know how I get here.
How I leave.

411
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,120
No one does.

412
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,240
It's as if there were trapped souls
that can't find the door..

413
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,760
While others move freely.

414
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,360
Here you can do so much.
You can produce so much.

415
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,680
But me...
What can I produce?

416
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,640
I don't know. You'll see
what you can bring.

417
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,200
(L'osmose)
What is the reason for it?

418
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,880
(L'osmose)
What is the cause of it?

419
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,800
(L'osmose)
A whole load of things

420
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,560
Production, what is it?

421
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,000
In Latin,
productio means to extend or bring forth,

422
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,400
But if you present evidence
at a trial,

423
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,840
you produce it.

424
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,040
It's also the act of engendering,
of giving birth.

425
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,840
It's a phenomenon found in nature

426
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,440
and also in society.

427
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,640
Karl Marx founds
his understanding of man on it.

428
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,080
Perhaps love is also
an extension of production

429
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,480
by other means.

430
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,000
A business deal above all.

431
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,680
A masterpiece of industrial influence

432
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,760
over romantic life and reproduction

433
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,720
to create prototypes:
your children.

434
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,040
Lives born of French fiction.

435
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,680
Today production in the noble sense
has a poor reputation.

436
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,000
Look at Jeff Bezos.

437
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,560
They say he sold his soul
to the devil,

438
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,560
but he just invents things.

439
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,520
Starting from a garage,
look where he is now.

440
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,960
His latest challenge: becoming immortal.

441
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,320
Immortality is a fine project.

442
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,600
Thanks to my channel,

443
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,880
you many not become immortal,

444
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,800
but you will live better.

445
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,360
For me, this world is evil,

446
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,640
and the evil within me comes from that.

447
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,560
I was born with the devil in me.

448
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,520
I was obliged to kill,

449
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,320
just as a poet is obliged to write.

450
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,840
Satan stood next to my crib

451
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,920
and has been with me since.

452
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,400
I was born to be possessed by demons.

453
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,600
How does it work specifically?

454
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,040
Specifically?

455
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,120
It's always the same,
and always different.

456
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,520
If I think of the last one...

457
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,280
She hitched a ride,
we talked a little in the car...

458
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,840
I looked at her.

459
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,120
And, the thing is,
that girl didn't even look human.

460
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,000
All I could see her as
was a store dummy.

461
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,480
She looked like an Apple phone.

462
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,920
She kept saying words that weren't hers.

463
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,040
Words that everyone says.

464
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,640
As if she were begging
to be looked at or heard.

465
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,560
So I pulled out a knife.

466
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,280
Then she was begging to live.
To go on living.

467
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,890
I got sick of listening to her,

468
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,940
so I stabbed her.

469
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,940
How did that feel?

470
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,080
I'd like some water.

471
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,680
Thank you.

472
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,160
You look into their eyes.

473
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,400
You feel the breath leave their body.

474
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,760
And, right then, believe me
you're God.

475
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,320
And after?

476
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,880
After, I went home.
I felt pretty good.

477
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,880
Good enough to eat pears, for instance.

478
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,720
Are you gonna hurt me?

479
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,520
-No.
-But you've often lied, right?

480
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,000
That's true.

481
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,360
You're totally indifferent.

482
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,720
Even psychopaths have emotions.

483
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,920
Well, maybe not.

484
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,040
Satan dwells in each one of us.

485
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,960
I reject
the hypocritical and moralistic dogma

486
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,720
of this so-called civilized society.

487
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,120
I don't need to hear those views.

488
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,720
I've heard them enough.
They make me sick.

489
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,800
Maybe you're just very paranoid.

490
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,920
-May I ask you something?
-Of course.

491
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,600
-It's a real question.
-I'm listening.

492
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,280
If I'm beheaded,

493
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,000
do you think I could hear,
even briefly,

494
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,480
the blood gushing from my neck?

495
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,720
The ultimate pleasure
to end all pleasure.

496
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,560
I don't know.
Maybe.

497
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,480
But very briefly.

498
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,440
That's something.

499
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,640
-I don't understand.
-Even psychopaths have emotions.

500
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,520
Well, maybe not.

501
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,760
Maybe you don't understand me
or simply can't.

502
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,560
-Scott...
-If I'm beheaded,

503
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,480
could I hear, even briefly,

504
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,920
the blood gushing from my neck?

505
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,040
The ultimate pleasure

506
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,240
to end all pleasure.

507
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,440
I don't understand!

508
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,360
I'm going to eat your soul.
Puke it up and eat it again.

509
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,560
I'm going to eat your soul.
Puke it up and eat it again!

510
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,520
Ted Bundy.

511
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,520
Charles Manson's out.
He never Killed.

512
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,000
-Edmund Kemper.
-Kemper's not bad.

513
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,920
-I like the cannibal.
-The Jap?

514
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,720
No, the German one.

515
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,080
The one with a 4-year-old girl
cut up in his fridge.

516
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,360
There were bits in the fridge,
a hand cooking in a pan

517
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,920
and even intestines jammed in the bin.

518
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,400
I don't know him. Gross.
I forget his name.

519
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,680
For me. Donald Harvey is the best

520
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,320
I find his story so touching.

521
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,040
No, it's Ted Bunny, hands down.

522
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,240
Plus he's a hunk.

523
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,720
Ok, but Donald Harvey killed
to ease his victims' pain.

524
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,040
That's beautiful, he said once,

525
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,520
"I'm the angel of death.",
That's beautiful.

526
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,720
The angel of death is Charles Cullen.

527
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,480
- There can be two.
- I'm sure.

528
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,760
-You're sure?
-I heard a story

529
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,040
about a woman
whose arm really hurt

530
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,600
because of injuries from burns
or something...

531
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,080
She was begging for someone to kill her.

532
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,640
So he killed her.
It's really beautiful.

533
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,560
Edmund Kemper's last victim
was his mother.

534
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,290
He beheaded her, put her head
on a shelf and used it as a dartboard

535
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,120
- Respect
- That's horrible.

536
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,040
Plus he was exceptionally gifted
with an IQ of 250.

537
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,600
-250?
-150, 150!

538
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,960
Chill.

539
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,560
Ted Bundy, returned to crime scenes

540
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,600
to bang his victims as long as he could.

541
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,520
Until animals ate them.

542
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,360
-Horrible.
-I think he said:

543
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,920
"I'm the coldest son of a bitch

544
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,360
you ever met."
-Ouh yeah!

545
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,040
You're all fans of the stars.

546
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,520
I think I'm touched more

547
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,080
by serial killers who stay unknown.

548
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,640
- True.
- They remain unknown.

549
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,320
They touch me the most.

550
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,480
- You don't seem touched.
- Looking at me?

551
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,320
With Zoom, no one knows

552
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,520
who's watching who.

553
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,840
It's wild. Looking at me, Tess?

554
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,920
Yes, I'm looking at you.

555
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,280
-Tess, I'm looking.
-Who am I looking at?

556
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,400
Ok, cut it out now.

557
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,760
Tess? The book?

558
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,760
I have the book.

559
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,280
Awesome.

560
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,640
No.

561
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,600
"How to be top dog
without being a bitch?"

562
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,360
It's a handbook?

563
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,440
-How to show character?
-I guess so.

564
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,400
Like how to be self-confident,

565
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,000
Bold and all that without...
-Without getting an attitude.

566
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,240
What's being a bitch?

567
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,640
I don't want to be vulgar...
It means what it says.

568
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,400
...

569
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,080
"A girl's superficial

570
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,440
relationships result from her

571
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,960
inner superficiality."

572
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:16,180
If your relationships are superficial,
you're superficial inside.

573
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,980
It's how you are.

574
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:23,810
Superficial relations don't make
you superficial. It's meaningless.

575
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:28,160
Why are we obliged to be superficial?
Start by asking that.

576
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,360
"A girl is superficial..."

577
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,520
Nice.

578
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,720
"Seduction never ends for a girl,

579
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,080
the girl ends with seduction."

580
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,880
-That's really sad.
-It's depressing.

581
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,360
-She lives for seduction?
-Horrible.

582
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,520
Who's this girl anyway?

583
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,170
It's us.

584
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,920
I didn't under it as a girl,
I though it meant

585
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,120
a citizen in society.

586
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,480
Why say girl if they don't mean a girl?

587
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,240
The citizen ends when their seduction...

588
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,720
-It's Greek to me.
-Who's behind you, Tess?

589
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,480
-No one.
-Are you sure?

590
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,440
Who sees someone being me?

591
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,400
The stress...

592
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,320
"A girl isn't meant
To understand you.

593
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,880
Understand us?

594
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,680
Understand what?

595
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,440
As the girl,
we can't understand ourselves?

596
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,200
Our parents?

597
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,680
So we never understand ourselves.

598
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,600
We don't know ourselves.

599
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,840
We don't understand ourselves
or others.

600
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,200
"The girl is a viewpoint on passing
time, but a viewpoint incarnated...

601
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,000
-Euh...
What happened?

602
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,560
Tess?
-Has she gone?

603
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,920
Tess?

604
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,240
Tess?
-Tess?

605
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,600
Act as if your decisions mattered.

606
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,480
Never mind reality.

607
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Our survival

608
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,500
depends on our capacity
for lying to ourselves.

609
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,400
Any news of Tess?

610
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,760
None at all.

611
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,920
-Spooky.
-Spooky, yeah.

612
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,600
-Totally spooky.
-Totally spooky.

613
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,240
The curfew...

614
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,240
Shit, I'm sick of this lockdown.

615
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,600
I'll go mad. I wanna kill someone,

616
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,840
blow stuff up.

617
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,720
Chill. Chill, babe.

618
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,520
We're in it together, we'll make it.

619
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,840
We're sure to.

620
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,560
Sharon seems suspicious.

621
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,960
I can't go on much longer.

622
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,000
But I'm not sure

623
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,400
What I feel for Barbara.

624
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,840
Do I love one,
the other or both.

625
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,440
I think I'm lost, Ashley.

626
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,640
Sorry I can't focus
On what you're saying.

627
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,440
I have problems too.

628
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,400
The curfew...
Shit, I'm sick of this lockdown.

629
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,840
I'll go mad.
I wanna kill someone,

630
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,920
Blow stuff up.

631
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,240
Chill, Ashley.
We're all in the same shit.

632
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,640
Screw others.

633
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,400
I have to do something.

634
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,600
Something has to happen.

635
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,000
I beg you, Scott. Fuck me.

636
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,560
-Shit, I'm your brother.
-Screw that.

637
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,920
I need to do something
That feels good.

638
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,720
Please, fuck me.

639
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,600
Ok, but even if winter
Is long and harsh,

640
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,960
spring always returns.

641
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,200
Screw that. This is winter.

642
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,360
I know what I say will not change

643
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,800
your behavior or your decisions.

644
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,640
But I'll say it anyway.

645
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,560
Maybe because I have no choice either.

646
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,320
But perhaps I do it too
to feel less lonely.

647
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,840
I can't see you.

648
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,240
I don't know you.

649
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,840
But I know you're there.

650
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,360
Even if there aren't
many subscribers yet.

651
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,680
Maybe there isn't even one for now.

652
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,560
But I know it will increase.

653
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,280
That it will work.

654
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,840
Shit, Scott,
you'll make me cum.

655
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,080
Why is your climate today?

656
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,960
My climate?

657
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,600
Yes, your internal weather.

658
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,880
The shock is too great

659
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,200
for me to figure out how I feel.

660
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,080
I can't think,

661
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,920
I feel anaesthetized,
I'm like a zombie

662
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,320
Maybe you could decide
to do differently?

663
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,280
Yes, but now I know it's no use.

664
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,200
A draw will determine
access to a vaccine.

665
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,760
Only 15% of the world's population
can be vaccinated.

666
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,320
Go on.

667
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:59,160
The draw will eliminate countries
rather than people.

668
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,840
With 7.8 billion people
it would be unmanageable.

669
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,240
But 197 countries are manageable.

670
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,280
I can't think clearly about my life.

671
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,080
I'd like to find the words, but I can't
I feel divided.

672
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,720
You know, a break-up

673
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,120
is a paroxysm of false phrases.

674
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,240
Phrases established before the break-up.

675
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,120
Our relationship
is a power struggle now.

676
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,960
-That's good. It's good
-I don't know...

677
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,840
I can't think clearly about my life.

678
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,520
I could never say anything conclusive.

679
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,760
There's no subject of dispute,

680
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,960
There are just desires for dispute.

681
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,200
Australia has been eliminated.

682
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,480
But it's not much use
as the population is only 25 million.

683
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,440
I don't know.
I can't think clearly about my life.

684
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,160
I could never say anything conclusive.

685
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,080
Confusion is a luxury only the very

686
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,880
young can afford.
And you're not so young.

687
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,720
Brazil is eliminated.

688
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,200
With 210 million, that's better.

689
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,120
I can't think clearly about my life.

690
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,320
Maturity isn't a matter of age
but of working on..

691
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,040
Africa is eliminated,

692
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,160
That's good as the population
is 1.216 billion.

693
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,720
We're progressing.

694
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,000
Ah.

695
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,600
France has just been eliminated.

696
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,360
I could never say anything conclusive.

697
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,560
Sometimes, girls rewrite history
to avoid feeling shame,

698
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,240
depriving themselves of depth.

699
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,440
-I don't understand.
-Think of yourself.

700
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,400
Solely of yourself.
-But...

701
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,320
Others?

702
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,560
You pay me, not others.

703
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,480
-What can I do?
-Be selfish

704
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,400
Later, confront what you've done.

705
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,600
Face it.

706
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,800
Yes, but it's painful and hard
Facing things.

707
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,720
It takes time from life's pleasures.

708
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,960
Sharon...

709
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,360
Yes?

710
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,280
The transference is working.

711
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,240
-I don't know.
-It is.

712
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,340
I'm doing a transference onto you.

713
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,460
I see you as my daughter.

714
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,760
Are you sure that's a good thing?

715
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,120
Yes. It's a very good thing,
believe me.

716
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,520
Now, imagine you're in a forest,

717
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,600
alone, at night,

718
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,280
and tell me what you feel.

719
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,600
Patricia?

720
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,440
Patricia, are you there?

721
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,800
Patricia, I'm going this way, ok?

722
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,080
Tess?

723
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,680
Shit, it's good to see you.

724
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,480
I'm really pleased.

725
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,760
Me too. I was worried
We all were.

726
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,920
It was horrific.

727
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,360
-What was? What happened?
-It was horrific.

728
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,200
Tell me.
Why are you in the Free Zone?

729
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,960
What's that?

730
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,880
Here. It's a place. I don't really know.

731
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,360
I can't get out of this fucking place.

732
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,840
How did you get here?
-I don't know,

733
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,280
I come in and out somehow.

734
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,640
What happened on Zoom?

735
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,120
A guy got into my place.
He came into my room.

736
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,880
Yeah, I know. We all saw him.

737
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,280
I didn't.
He was behind me.

738
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,120
He grabbed me by my neck.

739
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,080
I couldn't move or cry out.

740
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,850
He tried to strip me.

741
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,800
I kept hitting him,
so he began beating me.

742
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,600
He started tearing my clothes,

743
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,800
hitting me harder and harder.

744
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,760
He tried to rape me.

745
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,400
I hit him,
but he held my neck and my arms.

746
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,200
At one point, I kicked the wardrobe
and we fell back.

747
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,560
He let go of my neck,
and, staggering back

748
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,680
I fell six floors from the window.

749
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,320
That's how I died.

750
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,920
By falling six floors.

751
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,880
What are you doing here, Tess?

752
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,200
You should ask yourself

753
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,960
what you're doing here.

754
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,240
Tell me what's wrong, Sharon, please.

755
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,040
It can't be because of what I said.

756
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,040
I wasn't myself.
I spoke those words,

757
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,840
But it wasn't me saying them.

758
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,320
I don't give a damn about Barbara.
It's true. Believe me.

759
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,280
It's not that.

760
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,040
I don't give a damn
about that slut Barbara.

761
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,320
-So What's wrong?
-Scott...

762
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,080
I had a horrible dream.

763
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,200
And I think it was real.

764
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,520
That everything in the dream is true.

765
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,400
What did you dream?

766
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,200
I was alone in a forest at night.

767
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,240
Totally lost.

768
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,880
I didn't know where to go.

769
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,640
It got darker and darker.

770
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,800
As I went it deeper,
I began to meet people.

771
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,960
People I knew.
Well, people I had known.

772
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,200
Because they were all dead.

773
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,040
I met everyone who had died around me.

774
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,320
My father...

775
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,920
My brother...

776
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,160
I met them all in that forest.

777
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,880
-You spoke to them?
-Yes.

778
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,400
What did you say?

779
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,840
I asked questions, mainly to my brother.

780
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,600
Did he answer?

781
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,160
He said he was always watching me.

782
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,200
That he had seen me crying,

783
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:04,800
Limping and living in the belief
that injury should guide us.

784
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,600
He told me to stop seeing his death

785
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,960
as a mystery I had to solve.

786
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,800
It was a dream, Scott, but a true dream.

787
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,600
The forest exists. I was really there.

788
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,160
I'm sorry, Sharon. So sorry for you.

789
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,760
Did that scare you?

790
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,040
No, it enlightened me.

791
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,560
Good.

792
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,400
You know, one day, men will look back

793
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:49,160
and say I gave birth
to the 21st century.

794
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,720
No, the 21st century is mine.

795
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,480
You can't steal it.

796
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,080
So how did it enlighten you?

797
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,160
About what to do. I'm leaving.
We aren't fee to choose here,

798
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:07,000
it's scientifically proven.
-Where will you go?

799
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,920
Somewhere free will exists

800
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,360
Even if I confront my fears.
I'll confront them and it'll be fine.

801
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,150
Do you feel you're renouncing
something by doing that?

802
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,800
I know I'll hurt people,

803
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,770
They won't understand
and blame themselves,

804
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,640
say it's their fault.
I hope they 'll understand.

805
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,920
I won't be dead, just everywhere.

806
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,120
You're probably right.

807
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,840
Tutta

808
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,920
La volontà

809
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,280
D'un tratto se ne va

810
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:53,240
Di fronte all'ovvietà

811
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,000
Tutto questo

812
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,040
E immensità

813
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,640
E lavorare per 10 ore

814
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,720
Compiere sempre scelte di cuore

815
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,360
Chiedere scusa

816
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:16,440
I understand her so well.
If only I could leave too.

817
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,400
I'm not brave enough.

818
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:21,400
Sometimes, it can be braver to stay.

819
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,520
I miss her.

820
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,400
I have nothing special to say today.

821
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,600
Nothing to teach you
or to share with you.

822
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,880
Some days are like that
You have to accept them.

823
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,320
I don't know who I am anymore!

824
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,520
Screw this soap opera after 40 years!

825
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,080
Three people have played me!

826
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,120
Sharon, did you really buy a Revelator?

827
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,480
Am I played by Heidi Stone,

828
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,520
Monica Roberts,
or Sharon Potter?

829
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:28,530
Is it a sign that a Sharon
was the last to play Sharon Williams?

830
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:30,160
A sign I'm really her?

831
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:34,720
Tell me. I'm losing my mind!

832
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,020
And I'm accused of murder too,
accused of Jess' murder!

833
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:40,440
Do you realize?

834
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,640
Maybe it'll all work out.

835
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,000
I want to go away, Scott.

836
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,000
I want to leave you.

837
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,360
You want us to split up?

838
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,440
I gave you my most beautiful years.

839
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,760
Have you had other years?

840
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,920
Forgive me.

841
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,040
I hope the scars I leave you

842
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,600
won't make you forget
the power of my feelings for you.

843
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,880
Have you had other dreams?

844
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,280
You really want to know?

845
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,920
Yes.

846
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,800
Eagles don't fly with pigeons.

847
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,560
I know what you'll say.

848
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,400
What can you expect of my modernity

849
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,440
when all that awaits your is survival?

850
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,360
I simply say: take what you can.

851
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,680
I give you all I can.

852
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,400
I promise.

853
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,560
I give you all I...

854
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,720
<i>The weather with Patricia Coma</i>

855
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,520
We have to regain trust.

856
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:24,280
I feel better today
and I hope you do too.

857
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,880
So, the weather.

858
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,880
I don't know where you live,
but you do.

859
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:33,440
Look at the map behind me,
find your home

860
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,920
and you'll know the weather tomorrow.

861
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,200
If you're in northern France,

862
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:41,080
it will be around 57°C
In the afternoon.

863
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,560
If you live in Nice, like me,

864
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,480
It'll be 71°C.

865
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,920
You can't go out anyway,
so never mind.

866
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,840
Hello and welcome to my channel,
Patricia Coma's channel.

867
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,480
A channel that will teach you
to live better.

868
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:06,000
Coma comes from the Greek, kōma,
which means "deep sleep".

869
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,240
In Latin caumare,
which means "to rest in great heat"

870
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,640
And chômage, "unemployment".

871
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,880
Dad?

872
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,160
Dad, is that you?

873
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,920
Dad?

874
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,840
Hello, dear.

875
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:42,640
-Patricia.
-It's good to see you.

876
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,960
Do you have your Revelator?

877
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,640
No, I left it.

878
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,000
-It doesn't work here, right?
-No, it doesn't.

879
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,880
But can I do what I want here?

880
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:02,360
Yes. Here, you can be yourself.
No one will judge you.

881
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,960
-It's really scary.
-Yes, that's true.

882
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,320
Why sell things and go to a place
where they don't work?

883
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,720
I'm like everyone else.

884
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,080
I have to make a living

885
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:26,160
and I need somewhere to be free.

886
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,600
Why doesn't it work here?

887
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:34,600
Because here isn't like in real life.

888
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,160
It's a sort of...
halfway station.

889
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,160
Like an intermediary state.
A hazy state.

890
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:50,080
-But you...
Are you still alive?

891
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,160
Do you know what "limbo" means?

892
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:52,540
Anna,

893
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:57,580
there's no world before
and no world after,

894
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:02,020
as we have so often heard.

895
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:08,260
But there's you in the world

896
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:11,820
and that's what matters.

897
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:20,940
We need to think that our sacrifices

898
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:24,340
will be rewarded

899
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:28,420
by access to another reality.

900
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:34,860
That the negative
will be purifying in a way.

901
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:40,580
That the worst thing would be
that it's all no use.

902
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:47,740
We are passing through a period

903
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,900
that is between life and death,

904
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,460
between day and night.

905
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:59,940
A sort of day for night effect,

906
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:04,420
but without a director.

907
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:12,460
"If you pass through hell, do not stop."

908
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:16,660
Limbo,

909
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:21,780
is not just between two worlds,

910
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:25,820
between dream and reality.

911
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:33,740
It comes from <i>limbus</i>,
 meaning "the margin",

912
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:40,260
a blank space waiting to be filled.

913
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:44,940
In the centre, there is no space.

914
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:51,460
It is in limbo that you'll see

915
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:55,620
things impossible to see elsewhere.

916
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:01,020
That others will not see.

917
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:09,540
In this time of darkest night

918
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:12,820
in which we are sinking

919
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,380
ever more deeply,

920
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,940
there can be clarity

921
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:24,940
as vast as the obscurity.

922
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,380
One is so alone there,
one becomes oneself.

923
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:34,860
And that is the moment
when one attains poetry,

924
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,940
that which we shall need

925
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:41,100
when a new day dawns.

926
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:45,540
Because a new day will soon dawn.

927
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:54,780
A new day will soon dawn, my love,

928
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:59,460
and you will emerge from limbo

929
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:04,700
with a strength that you cannot imagine.

930
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:15,220
And I shall be near you,

931
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,660
or rather behind you,

932
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:26,060
watching you unleash it.

933
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:32,540
That will be the start of another story.

934
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:38,180
A story that belongs only to you.
