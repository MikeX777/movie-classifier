1
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,187
Hello... agent 166 here.

2
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:17,037
Hello it's the police station.

3
00:01:17,157 --> 00:01:20,440
Hello... hello.

4
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:23,884
This is the police station... hello.

5
00:01:24,765 --> 00:01:25,566
Let's go.

6
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:35,656
He's dead.

7
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:28,088
Should have arrived?

8
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,289
Looks like it.

9
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:37,698
Let's go.

10
00:03:37,778 --> 00:03:38,899
Okay.

11
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:17,818
Come on.

12
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,762
The new agent from London is here.

13
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:44,885
Looks like the detective has
high hopes for him.

14
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:48,929
What hopes? More like another agent
for us to kill.

15
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:50,330
Let's go.

16
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,151
Lady do you need a taxi?

17
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:42,583
Got a light?

18
00:05:47,628 --> 00:05:49,189
"Flying Horse Night Club"

19
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:03,644
Where am I staying?

20
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:04,805
The Crown Hotel.

21
00:06:21,862 --> 00:06:22,783
Thanks.

22
00:07:02,342 --> 00:07:08,709
Although you have my life

23
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:15,075
but you don't have my soul.

24
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:21,321
Because in my heart

25
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:27,688
there's only one person.

26
00:07:27,808 --> 00:07:33,854
My life has gone numb

27
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:40,060
but my soul is still alive.

28
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:46,226
No matter what you do

29
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:52,753
you don't have the key to my heart.

30
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:56,837
I don't ask for much

31
00:07:56,957 --> 00:08:01,001
just some time together.

32
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:05,245
It might only be a dream

33
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:09,570
but I'll treasure every second of it.

34
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:15,736
Why linger on a sad life... one may ask!

35
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:21,942
Makes sense if I can at least
keep my soul pure.

36
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:28,148
For my love for him

37
00:08:28,268 --> 00:08:37,998
the one I can never forget.

38
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:47,808
Check that babe out.

39
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:49,049
Where?

40
00:08:52,693 --> 00:08:55,576
Judging from her jewellery
she must be rich

41
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:57,698
...and she's quite a looker.

42
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,740
Have you seen her before?

43
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,500
No.

44
00:09:03,864 --> 00:09:04,905
I'll go up to her.

45
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:05,706
Go on.

46
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:12,993
Hey when did you get here?

47
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:17,878
You look preoccupied

48
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:18,799
what are you looking at?

49
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:21,562
Hello!

50
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,324
Who are you?

51
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:27,447
Such a lovely occasion and yet you ask?

52
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:29,249
What are you doing?

53
00:09:31,812 --> 00:09:34,655
Are you alone? Let me keep you company.

54
00:09:37,337 --> 00:09:38,298
Do I know you?

55
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:43,744
I'm 403 now you know me.

56
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:47,427
Let me keep you company.

57
00:09:47,948 --> 00:09:49,510
You must be drunk.

58
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,871
What's the mission?

59
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:54,675
Drunk? I'm only intoxicated by
your beauty.

60
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:56,356
That man there with songstress Dolly...

61
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:57,878
He is Cheng Tiehu. You take a look

62
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,562
He's our lead.

63
00:10:01,682 --> 00:10:03,483
Come on

64
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:04,925
...we're friends now.

65
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:06,486
Please leave right away.

66
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:07,768
The next point of contact.

67
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:11,371
Got it! Don't be such a party pooper.

68
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:13,614
The bowling alley at 9 p.m. tomorrow.

69
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:16,937
Come on dance with me come on.

70
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:18,539
You hit me?

71
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,861
How dare you!

72
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:23,263
You should be flattered.

73
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:25,505
You must dance with me come on.

74
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:26,987
Come on...

75
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:33,033
What are you doing?

76
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:35,155
Please stop bothering the lady.

77
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:37,598
Who the hell are you? Beat him up.

78
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:33,974
It's alright...

79
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,537
It's over...

80
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,061
Put all the damages...

81
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:41,902
on my bill.

82
00:11:42,022 --> 00:11:42,863
Okay

83
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:45,826
Where are you staying?
I'll give you a lift.

84
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:48,549
Oh where's my necklace?

85
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:53,073
Let's go.

86
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:56,276
Get back on stage.

87
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:20,300
A pretty lady like you

88
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,022
...shouldn't be drinking out alone.

89
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,624
That's just too dangerous.

90
00:12:24,384 --> 00:12:26,026
You have a point.

91
00:12:26,707 --> 00:12:28,308
You should get some rest.

92
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,991
See you.

93
00:12:31,071 --> 00:12:31,992
Bye.

94
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:46,887
Sorry I forgot to return this.

95
00:12:48,488 --> 00:12:50,410
God it's broken!

96
00:12:50,611 --> 00:12:51,491
Let me take a look.

97
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,494
Should I fix it?

98
00:12:54,615 --> 00:12:55,375
You know how?

99
00:12:55,495 --> 00:12:56,456
I'll try.

100
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:08,949
Quite precious I must say

101
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:11,111
Must have cost you around $100000

102
00:13:11,431 --> 00:13:13,994
Very good. How do you know?

103
00:13:14,515 --> 00:13:16,116
You paid too much for it.

104
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:19,720
I'd only charge you $85000.

105
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,841
You?

106
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:28,569
"Cheng Tiehu Manager Echo Jewellery"

107
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,852
So you're in the business.

108
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,615
Mr. Cheng my name is Luo Na.

109
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:36,496
Are you here on a vacation?

110
00:13:36,577 --> 00:13:41,501
No actually I'm here to see someone

111
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:45,986
Might as well...
buy some good quality diamonds.

112
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:47,107
Excellent

113
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,149
Should you need to buy any jewellery

114
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:50,831
...my store welcomes you always.

115
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:02,683
It's fixed.

116
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:03,644
Thanks.

117
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,966
I don't know anyone here

118
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:07,608
I'll certainly pay a visit to your store.

119
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:09,409
Please give me a good price
for the jewellery.

120
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:12,212
Of course it'd be to your satisfaction.

121
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:12,773
I should go now.

122
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,333
Alright.

123
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:13,814
Bye.

124
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:14,895
Bye.

125
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:06,346
You still remember me?

126
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,269
Good timing right?

127
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:10,871
Where did you go with the woman?

128
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:12,312
Don't be jealous.

129
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:16,436
Let me tell you she's something.

130
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:19,479
Of course young and pretty

131
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,522
...and she looks rich.

132
00:15:21,642 --> 00:15:22,763
Not that

133
00:15:22,883 --> 00:15:24,284
I saw a picture of her in the locket

134
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:26,446
It's her with the "Bald guy"

135
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,248
The "Bald guy"

136
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,170
I think I should check her background.

137
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,812
Haven't you heard that after
he got arrested

138
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:34,855
a woman has got hold of all his wealth?

139
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,977
Could that be her?

140
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:40,621
Get me a towel.

141
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:17,457
What is it Dolly?

142
00:16:17,538 --> 00:16:18,659
Chief

143
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:21,221
Tiehu has just met a woman who's new here.

144
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:24,464
She's very rich could have links
with the Bald Guy.

145
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:27,948
Tell Tiehu to check on her background.

146
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:29,229
Keep on guard.

147
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:30,230
Yes chief.

148
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,071
Dolly.

149
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:31,752
Here.

150
00:16:31,872 --> 00:16:33,954
Good job at the phone booth.

151
00:16:34,074 --> 00:16:36,316
You'll be rewarded.

152
00:16:36,436 --> 00:16:37,397
Thank you chief.

153
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,441
Lucky you!

154
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,522
Zhicheng.

"Unloading coffin by River Xia
on April 17th"

156
00:22:31,431 --> 00:22:33,033
"Unloading coffin by River Xia

157
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:05,886
Please come inside.

158
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,047
Is the manager here?

159
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:08,008
Yes he is.

160
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:09,249
Mr. Cheng.

161
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,291
Hi!

162
00:24:15,295 --> 00:24:17,137
What a surprise welcome!

163
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:19,019
Please come upstairs.

164
00:24:27,027 --> 00:24:28,028
Have a seat.

165
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:35,235
Smoke?

166
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:37,197
I'd like to buy some diamonds.

167
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:37,878
Sure.

168
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:40,320
Inlay diamonds or loose ones?

169
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,602
Whatever!

170
00:24:41,682 --> 00:24:42,763
I'll show you.

171
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:43,644
OK.

172
00:25:24,885 --> 00:25:26,687
I know that you won't be interested
in these.

173
00:25:26,807 --> 00:25:29,009
2 days later we got a new shipment
coming in.

174
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:30,410
The 17th?

175
00:25:31,932 --> 00:25:33,774
The best grade from South America;

176
00:25:33,894 --> 00:25:35,215
You won't be disappointed.

177
00:25:35,656 --> 00:25:38,859
Then I have to wait two more days.
I'll be bored.

178
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:41,021
I could show you around.

179
00:25:41,141 --> 00:25:42,182
You won't be bored.

180
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:43,143
You will?

181
00:25:43,263 --> 00:25:45,626
Sincerely.

182
00:25:46,226 --> 00:25:47,187
Thanks.

"Bring Tiehu to meet the Bald"

184
00:27:35,976 --> 00:27:37,417
Come with me.

185
00:28:27,387 --> 00:28:31,311
I think she could be the Bald guy's
mistress.

186
00:28:32,993 --> 00:28:36,116
It'd be a big deal if she really is.

187
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:37,598
Where is she now?

188
00:28:37,678 --> 00:28:40,360
We said goodbye after the prison visit

189
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,643
she said she wanted to go shopping.

190
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:30,851
Now that we've confirmed her identity...

191
00:29:30,971 --> 00:29:32,893
What's the next step?

192
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:34,815
What's the rush?

193
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:36,937
I'm not hurrying.

194
00:29:37,057 --> 00:29:39,980
Rather we'd get it over with
this being a big issue

195
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,984
I must ask for the chief's instructions.

196
00:29:58,238 --> 00:29:58,959
I'm Luo Na.

197
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:02,643
I've been looking for you everywhere!

198
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:05,525
What for?

199
00:30:05,646 --> 00:30:07,087
The Bald guy gave you a large sum;

200
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:08,929
You should give it up
what are you waiting for?

201
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:11,131
The money's for me

202
00:30:11,251 --> 00:30:12,212
...you've got nothing to do with it.

203
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:14,815
What? You want everything to yourself?

204
00:30:14,895 --> 00:30:17,257
We deserve the money.

205
00:30:17,337 --> 00:30:18,819
At least we should get half.

206
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:19,980
Half of it?

207
00:30:20,701 --> 00:30:23,263
What a joke! He treated you guys...

208
00:30:23,383 --> 00:30:25,025
really well when you worked for him.

209
00:30:25,105 --> 00:30:26,627
Be smart Luo Na.

210
00:30:26,747 --> 00:30:29,229
Bald guy's men wanted to split
the money with her.

211
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,831
From the way she speaks

212
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:32,833
I could imagine that she isn't
easy to handle.

213
00:30:32,913 --> 00:30:34,755
You aren't getting a dime.

214
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,516
Fine don't regret.

215
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:37,998
We'll see.

216
00:30:38,078 --> 00:30:41,121
Show me what you've got.

217
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:43,323
I'm not scared of you.

218
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:11,572
Follow them.

219
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,162
Traffic unit... traffic unit.

220
00:32:42,282 --> 00:32:44,084
We await your order.

221
00:32:44,204 --> 00:32:47,007
Send back up... send back up now.

222
00:32:47,087 --> 00:32:48,048
Got it.

223
00:33:14,675 --> 00:33:15,636
Let's go.

224
00:35:14,274 --> 00:35:18,518
Attention all units.

225
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,401
Urgent...

226
00:35:21,481 --> 00:35:24,444
Pull over the car
with a license plate AA2058

227
00:35:24,524 --> 00:35:27,768
Grey roadster.

228
00:35:27,888 --> 00:35:29,970
Two young male suspects in the car.

229
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,732
They're armed.

230
00:35:31,852 --> 00:35:34,454
Please pay attention... over.

231
00:36:02,482 --> 00:36:03,604
What is it?

232
00:36:04,284 --> 00:36:05,205
Go.

233
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:52,252
Chief.

234
00:36:52,332 --> 00:36:55,055
B1 and C7 have arrived.

235
00:36:55,135 --> 00:36:56,777
I'll see them right away.

236
00:36:58,218 --> 00:36:59,099
Yes.

237
00:37:16,476 --> 00:37:17,678
The chief will see you right away.

238
00:37:17,798 --> 00:37:18,759
Yes.

239
00:37:45,986 --> 00:37:48,068
Chief I've told Tiehu and others

240
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:50,671
...to spy on Luo Na.

241
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:52,833
Nothing suspicious so far.

242
00:37:54,595 --> 00:37:56,757
She's indeed Bald Guy's mistress.

243
00:37:56,877 --> 00:37:58,719
These are the pictures I took.

244
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:00,500
Pass it to C7.

245
00:39:00,621 --> 00:39:01,301
Yes.

246
00:39:11,271 --> 00:39:13,994
Keep spying on her.

247
00:39:14,074 --> 00:39:14,995
Yes.

248
00:39:16,957 --> 00:39:19,439
There's a hidden infrared camera
in this jewellery box

249
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:21,041
...which can film in the dark.

250
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:25,005
C7 give this to her as a present

251
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:25,806
Yes.

252
00:39:25,886 --> 00:39:28,088
Tell her to meet me
at Fair Lady Beauty Salon.

253
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:31,411
I want to take a look at her.

254
00:39:31,491 --> 00:39:32,412
Yes.

255
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:51,031
Why did you give this to me?

256
00:39:51,151 --> 00:39:52,673
I walked pass an antique shop

257
00:39:52,793 --> 00:39:54,274
...and sort of took a fancy to it.

258
00:39:54,354 --> 00:39:56,757
I thought you might like it.

259
00:39:56,877 --> 00:39:57,838
Thanks.

260
00:39:57,918 --> 00:40:00,681
Luo Na about the shipment I told you

261
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:02,082
I've already made an appointment
with the seller.

262
00:40:02,202 --> 00:40:04,244
Where?

263
00:40:04,364 --> 00:40:06,286
Fair Beauty Salon 3pm tomorrow.

264
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:06,927
I'll go with you.

265
00:40:07,047 --> 00:40:07,888
Sure.

266
00:40:15,576 --> 00:40:17,257
Why isn't she here yet?

267
00:40:18,939 --> 00:40:21,902
It's only 2:50.

268
00:40:22,022 --> 00:40:22,783
And why does she want to meet me

269
00:40:22,863 --> 00:40:25,025
...in a beauty salon?

270
00:40:25,706 --> 00:40:27,908
I don't know

271
00:40:28,028 --> 00:40:29,830
I guess because beauty salon is a
favorite for women.

272
00:40:31,071 --> 00:40:32,192
I'll set your hair Mr. Cheng?

273
00:40:32,272 --> 00:40:33,033
Sure.

274
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:36,476
Please come inside.

275
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:05,626
Miss Luo would you like to read
the headlines?

276
00:41:06,026 --> 00:41:06,587
What do you want?

277
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:09,830
Just a chat with you.

278
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,231
What about?

279
00:41:11,311 --> 00:41:12,793
The Bald Guy.

280
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:10,571
Move over...

281
00:42:58,619 --> 00:42:59,660
The police is here.

282
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,501
Let's go before we get into trouble.

283
00:43:21,441 --> 00:43:23,283
Let's go.

284
00:43:23,403 --> 00:43:26,206
Go!

285
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,649
Pick him up.

286
00:43:34,575 --> 00:43:36,176
Mr. Chen.

287
00:43:42,182 --> 00:43:46,066
Mission accomplished sir.

288
00:43:56,316 --> 00:43:57,037
Have a drink.

289
00:43:57,117 --> 00:43:57,918
Thanks.

290
00:44:04,204 --> 00:44:05,005
Who were they?

291
00:44:05,085 --> 00:44:06,647
What do they want from you?

292
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:12,252
Sorry I shouldn't pry.

293
00:44:13,654 --> 00:44:18,418
There's no point in keeping things
from you.

294
00:44:18,498 --> 00:44:20,661
Remember the man

295
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:22,703
I visited in the prison the other day?

296
00:44:22,823 --> 00:44:27,027
His nickname is "Bald Guy".
Have you heard of him?

297
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:32,232
A very well known smuggler.

298
00:44:32,352 --> 00:44:36,196
I was an orphan since I was very young.

299
00:44:36,276 --> 00:44:38,799
He has been taking care of me.

300
00:44:38,879 --> 00:44:40,641
Before he got arrested

301
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:43,924
he left me a large sum of money
to safe keep.

302
00:44:44,044 --> 00:44:48,008
And his men have been stalking me

303
00:44:48,128 --> 00:44:51,932
...tracking me down and hassling
for the money.

304
00:44:52,052 --> 00:44:57,537
I've been on the run.

305
00:44:58,298 --> 00:45:05,706
Who'd have thought that
they could find me!

306
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:14,715
If it wasn't for you...

307
00:45:14,835 --> 00:45:17,397
I'd have been kidnapped by them.

308
00:45:17,477 --> 00:45:19,079
Don't say that Luo Na.

309
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:20,080
We are friends.

310
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,402
I can't let them bully you around.

311
00:45:22,482 --> 00:45:25,966
They are ruthless.

312
00:45:26,086 --> 00:45:30,250
I'm totally on my own.

313
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:33,413
They could kill me sooner or later.

314
00:45:34,615 --> 00:45:36,456
What should I do?

315
00:45:39,499 --> 00:45:40,460
Don't worry.

316
00:45:40,581 --> 00:45:43,303
I'll do whatever I can to protect you.

317
00:45:47,227 --> 00:45:48,869
You?

318
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:54,995
Why are you so nice to me?

319
00:45:55,075 --> 00:45:56,917
You should know.

320
00:45:57,998 --> 00:45:59,600
You're lying!

321
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,843
No I'm very sincere.

322
00:46:11,051 --> 00:46:14,294
Don't lie to me don't let go!

323
00:46:14,414 --> 00:46:18,298
I love you trust me.

324
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:20,941
Stop it.

325
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:24,104
I know you have a lover.

326
00:46:24,224 --> 00:46:25,225
Who?

327
00:46:25,345 --> 00:46:26,947
The singer.

328
00:46:27,067 --> 00:46:30,711
Dolly? She's just a fling.

329
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:33,674
Since I've met you

330
00:46:33,754 --> 00:46:35,676
I fell in love.

331
00:47:36,697 --> 00:47:37,497
Come in.

332
00:47:56,597 --> 00:47:58,238
What do you want?

333
00:47:58,358 --> 00:48:00,360
You should know that it's my room.

334
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,443
So what? Where's Tiehu?

335
00:48:05,285 --> 00:48:06,567
Haven't you got any manners?

336
00:48:06,687 --> 00:48:09,049
Don't pretend that you're from
the upper crust.

337
00:48:09,129 --> 00:48:10,891
I know that...

338
00:48:11,011 --> 00:48:14,935
you're the mistress of the Bald Guy
the smuggler.

339
00:48:15,055 --> 00:48:18,699
So you've done your homework.

340
00:48:19,499 --> 00:48:20,901
Of course.

341
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:25,305
It's not a big deal that you have money.

342
00:48:25,425 --> 00:48:28,629
I'm warning you Tiehu is my man.

343
00:48:28,709 --> 00:48:30,631
Get your hands off him!

344
00:48:30,711 --> 00:48:33,674
Don't even think of stealing him
away from me.

345
00:48:35,035 --> 00:48:37,638
I don't want to have a conversation
with you.

346
00:48:37,758 --> 00:48:41,962
I'll call the police if you won't leave.

347
00:48:42,082 --> 00:48:44,204
Don't try to mess with me.

348
00:48:47,608 --> 00:48:50,851
Little obnoxious tramp
if you don't speak clearly

349
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:52,532
...l'm gonna kill you.

350
00:50:26,146 --> 00:50:27,467
Very impressive!

351
00:50:27,588 --> 00:50:30,591
We need a talent like her!

352
00:50:30,671 --> 00:50:33,313
She's loaded with money...
why'd she join us?

353
00:50:36,236 --> 00:50:39,119
If I want her then it's not up to her.

354
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:42,402
She has no choice when I want to pick her.

355
00:50:42,482 --> 00:50:44,244
Tell Tiehu to arrange with her.

356
00:50:44,364 --> 00:50:46,687
Bring money to my yacht to see
the merchandise.

357
00:50:46,807 --> 00:50:47,648
Yes.

358
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:30,851
Please sit down.

359
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:44,144
This is Mrs. Jin and this is Miss Luo Na.

360
00:51:44,264 --> 00:51:45,746
Have you brought your money?

361
00:51:45,866 --> 00:51:46,787
Yes.

362
00:52:05,405 --> 00:52:06,406
All there.

363
00:52:31,872 --> 00:52:34,955
These are the best grade.

364
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:58,458
Miss Luo Mr. Cheng Tiehu sent us.

365
00:52:58,538 --> 00:53:00,300
The bank's safety deposit box is ready.

366
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,942
He told us to escort you to the bank.

367
00:53:05,065 --> 00:53:06,747
This is Mr. Cheng's card.

368
00:53:10,551 --> 00:53:11,151
Please come in.

369
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,192
Thanks.

370
00:53:14,675 --> 00:53:15,355
This is it.

371
00:53:15,475 --> 00:53:16,276
Alright...

372
00:53:29,489 --> 00:53:30,290
Let's go.

373
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:32,833
Leave her here.

374
00:54:32,953 --> 00:54:34,755
Hurry.

375
00:55:02,222 --> 00:55:04,224
A woman let's take a look.

376
00:55:15,155 --> 00:55:16,276
Luo Na.

377
00:55:18,038 --> 00:55:19,319
Luo Na.

378
00:55:22,522 --> 00:55:23,644
Luo Na.

379
00:55:25,085 --> 00:55:25,846
Are you looking for Miss Luo?

380
00:55:25,926 --> 00:55:26,727
Has she gone out?

381
00:55:26,847 --> 00:55:29,049
Not since she returned this afternoon.

382
00:55:30,891 --> 00:55:34,214
She looked pale when she came back.

383
00:55:34,855 --> 00:55:35,535
If you could please open the door

384
00:55:35,656 --> 00:55:36,617
Sure.

385
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:42,342
Thanks.

386
00:55:45,265 --> 00:55:51,031
Luo Na...

387
00:56:03,644 --> 00:56:04,725
"Luo Na like we said before

388
00:56:04,845 --> 00:56:06,286
we'll eventually claim back the money...

389
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:07,848
which was left to us by the Bald Guy.

390
00:56:07,928 --> 00:56:09,009
If you dare to call the police

391
00:56:09,089 --> 00:56:10,851
we'll kill you for sure"

392
00:56:43,163 --> 00:56:44,284
Who are you?

393
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:45,726
I'm her friend.

394
00:56:45,846 --> 00:56:46,847
Didn't you spot the...

395
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:48,809
no visitors sign outside?

396
00:56:49,289 --> 00:56:50,450
Sorry.

397
00:56:50,571 --> 00:56:52,773
She's still in critical condition.

398
00:56:52,893 --> 00:56:55,976
No guests.

399
00:56:56,096 --> 00:56:57,537
Please leave right away.

400
00:56:57,898 --> 00:56:58,939
Sure.

401
00:57:02,863 --> 00:57:04,865
Doctor you must save her.

402
00:57:04,945 --> 00:57:06,466
You see she has no friend...

403
00:57:06,587 --> 00:57:07,868
or relative here other than me.

404
00:57:07,988 --> 00:57:09,710
Don't worry we'll try our best.

405
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:10,711
Thanks.

406
00:57:25,445 --> 00:57:26,446
Detective.

407
00:57:27,207 --> 00:57:30,010
Well done Ai Si.

408
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:31,692
What's my next step?

409
00:57:31,812 --> 00:57:33,574
What they're trying to do is obvious.

410
00:57:33,694 --> 00:57:35,976
First they sold you the diamonds
at a low price. Then

411
00:57:36,096 --> 00:57:38,739
they stole it all back pretending to
be Bald Guy's men.

412
00:57:38,859 --> 00:57:41,061
So you're forced into a dead end.

413
00:57:41,461 --> 00:57:42,502
I guess their goal...

414
00:57:42,623 --> 00:57:44,585
is wanting you to join their group.

415
00:57:44,705 --> 00:57:46,386
If that's the case

416
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:48,428
I'm looking forward to it.

417
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:50,270
But they didn't know that...

418
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:52,953
we've already caught all of
Bald Guy's crew.

419
00:57:53,073 --> 00:57:53,794
But why are they forcing me

420
00:57:53,874 --> 00:57:55,636
...to join them?

421
00:57:55,716 --> 00:57:58,238
I reckon they take you to be
Bald Guy's mistress

422
00:57:58,358 --> 00:58:00,360
...and they need a talent like you.

423
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,843
So they want your money and you.

424
00:58:02,923 --> 00:58:05,966
They are so wicked.

425
00:58:06,086 --> 00:58:09,369
Go with the flow infiltrate them.

426
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:12,412
According to our sources
they have a large network

427
00:58:12,492 --> 00:58:14,494
...robbery smuggling

428
00:58:14,615 --> 00:58:17,257
drug trafficking... you name it.

429
00:58:17,337 --> 00:58:19,820
Find out where their HQ is

430
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:20,741
...and try to blow it up.

431
00:58:20,861 --> 00:58:22,102
We'll work with you

432
00:58:22,222 --> 00:58:23,503
...to put them in jail.

433
00:58:23,624 --> 00:58:25,025
I'll try my best.

434
00:58:25,105 --> 00:58:27,147
I have some gadgets for you.

435
00:58:37,357 --> 00:58:38,919
A bottle of perfume...

436
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,923
on this end;

437
00:58:43,043 --> 00:58:44,965
And it works as a tranquilizer
on the other.

438
00:58:51,852 --> 00:58:55,335
This is a camera

439
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:58,018
you can take pictures in the dark.

440
00:59:03,223 --> 00:59:06,827
As for this purse

441
00:59:06,907 --> 00:59:09,029
press here and bullets will fire
from both ends.

442
00:59:09,149 --> 00:59:11,632
Could kill within 20 yards.

443
00:59:18,478 --> 00:59:20,480
As for this watch...

444
00:59:20,561 --> 00:59:23,123
there are two time bombs inside.

445
00:59:23,243 --> 00:59:26,326
It can attach to any metallic surface.

446
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:33,894
When in danger just turn...

447
00:59:34,014 --> 00:59:37,778
the gem on the headband

448
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,143
through these fine wires;

449
00:59:43,263 --> 00:59:45,425
We'll receive your signal

450
00:59:45,826 --> 00:59:47,307
...and it will show us your location.

451
00:59:47,427 --> 00:59:49,229
We'll rush to save you.

452
00:59:51,912 --> 00:59:53,233
Got it?

453
00:59:54,474 --> 00:59:56,957
This is a dangerous and tough mission.

454
00:59:57,077 --> 00:59:58,639
You've got to be very careful.

455
00:59:58,759 --> 01:00:01,081
Since it's my job

456
01:00:01,201 --> 01:00:05,165
and to get revenge for Zhicheng
I'm not afraid.

457
01:00:05,285 --> 01:00:08,248
Good luck!

458
01:00:25,105 --> 01:00:26,827
You could be hassled by the Bald guy's men

459
01:00:26,947 --> 01:00:28,749
That's why I checked you out
from the hotel.

460
01:00:28,869 --> 01:00:29,870
Where am I staying then?

461
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:31,071
Stay at my place for a while.

462
01:00:31,191 --> 01:00:32,993
I'll take care of everything.

463
01:00:36,396 --> 01:00:37,237
Let's go.

464
01:00:51,251 --> 01:00:52,212
Who is it?

465
01:00:55,535 --> 01:00:56,617
Me.

466
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:08,829
How about a truce?

467
01:01:13,073 --> 01:01:15,876
I know everything about you.

468
01:01:17,477 --> 01:01:22,362
You've come to an dead end.

469
01:01:24,084 --> 01:01:26,286
What are your plans?

470
01:01:26,406 --> 01:01:28,048
I don't know what you mean.

471
01:01:28,128 --> 01:01:30,170
Fine I'll be frank.

472
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:33,293
You know we're sort of in the same boat.

473
01:01:33,413 --> 01:01:36,456
You don't want to be hassled
by Bald Guy's men

474
01:01:36,577 --> 01:01:38,619
...and you want to be alive.

475
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:42,262
You also wish to maintain your
luxurious lifestyle.

476
01:01:42,382 --> 01:01:43,984
There's only one way out.

477
01:01:44,384 --> 01:01:45,465
What?

478
01:01:45,586 --> 01:01:46,907
Join us.

479
01:01:47,027 --> 01:01:48,188
Dolly.

480
01:01:48,468 --> 01:01:51,031
I've asked for the chief's permission.

481
01:01:51,832 --> 01:01:53,393
What kind of an organization are you?

482
01:01:53,473 --> 01:01:54,314
The Dark Angels

483
01:01:54,434 --> 01:01:57,918
Tiehu say if eventually I do agree
to join;

484
01:01:58,038 --> 01:01:59,800
Will they guarantee my safety...

485
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,401
and a good lifestyle?

486
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:05,566
The chief is mighty impressed with you.

487
01:02:05,686 --> 01:02:07,968
You'll be in danger should you refuse.

488
01:02:09,009 --> 01:02:10,530
Is that true?

489
01:02:14,615 --> 01:02:17,618
Fine I'll join you.

490
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,081
Come with me.

491
01:04:19,419 --> 01:04:20,420
Chief

492
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:24,464
B1 and C7 are here with Luo Na.

493
01:04:24,585 --> 01:04:26,426
Line up everyone.

494
01:04:26,546 --> 01:04:27,267
Yes.

495
01:04:33,393 --> 01:04:35,515
Send them in.

496
01:04:36,476 --> 01:04:37,397
Yes chief.

497
01:05:29,089 --> 01:05:32,052
We're here to recommend Luo Na to join us.

498
01:05:32,573 --> 01:05:34,134
Hello chief.

499
01:05:51,191 --> 01:05:54,955
Luo Na are you sincere in joining
the Dark Angels?

500
01:05:55,075 --> 01:05:56,436
Wholeheartedly.

501
01:05:56,556 --> 01:05:58,839
Once a member you'll never get out.

502
01:05:58,919 --> 01:06:01,001
Are you willing to give everything
including...

503
01:06:01,081 --> 01:06:03,804
your life and absolute devotion
to the society?

504
01:06:03,884 --> 01:06:04,605
I do.

505
01:06:04,685 --> 01:06:07,728
And that should you betray us
you'll be shot to death.

506
01:06:07,848 --> 01:06:08,969
I understand.

507
01:06:09,089 --> 01:06:09,930
No regrets?

508
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,331
No.

509
01:06:11,451 --> 01:06:12,292
Good.

510
01:06:19,499 --> 01:06:20,661
What is it?

511
01:06:20,781 --> 01:06:23,704
Bangkok branch wants to report to you.

512
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:40,721
Chief.

513
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:44,725
Connect the Bangkok branch.

514
01:06:44,845 --> 01:06:45,686
Yes.

515
01:06:49,409 --> 01:06:51,051
The call's ready chief.

516
01:06:53,493 --> 01:06:54,575
This is the HQ.

517
01:06:54,695 --> 01:06:56,977
The goods have been shipped
and it'd be...

518
01:06:57,097 --> 01:07:00,821
unloaded at 2am in a deserted island
in Pattaya.

519
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:01,862
Yes.

520
01:07:01,982 --> 01:07:04,865
We already have the diamonds of
Pinjun Jewellery Co.

521
01:07:04,985 --> 01:07:08,629
Police is keeping watch
we can't use the original plan

522
01:07:08,749 --> 01:07:11,231
Change of plan. Use toys instead...

523
01:07:11,351 --> 01:07:13,393
and shift to Flight 709.

524
01:07:13,473 --> 01:07:15,876
Yes chief.

525
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:43,143
Let's welcome our new member.

526
01:07:43,263 --> 01:07:45,586
Welcome.

527
01:07:46,506 --> 01:07:47,948
Thank you everyone.

528
01:07:48,789 --> 01:07:50,631
Serve the organization well.

529
01:07:50,751 --> 01:07:51,832
Yes.

530
01:07:51,952 --> 01:07:53,313
I'll show you around.

531
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:42,402
This is the most dangerous;
Tunnel of Fatal Light.

532
01:08:45,045 --> 01:08:48,048
Anything through here will get burnt.

533
01:08:50,891 --> 01:08:51,772
Look.

534
01:08:57,858 --> 01:09:00,781
You must wear one of these
protective gear.

535
01:09:34,735 --> 01:09:38,298
Attention all departments...

536
01:09:38,418 --> 01:09:42,583
The chief is inspecting...

537
01:10:12,492 --> 01:10:13,574
Follow me.

538
01:10:43,003 --> 01:10:45,966
Our experts have a new creation.

539
01:10:46,086 --> 01:10:48,609
It's still in testing progress.

540
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:54,534
Not only that it provides a boost of
energy

541
01:10:54,655 --> 01:10:58,098
...it will also regenerate your youth.

542
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:03,023
When we succeed

543
01:11:03,143 --> 01:11:06,907
...this will be the only
drug people purchase.

544
01:11:07,027 --> 01:11:09,149
I believe we'll be successful.

545
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:10,991
A4.

546
01:11:11,071 --> 01:11:11,792
Here.

547
01:11:11,872 --> 01:11:13,153
Show her to her room.

548
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:13,634
Yes madam.

549
01:11:13,754 --> 01:11:16,476
This is your new home.

550
01:11:16,597 --> 01:11:19,159
I'll give you an important mission
tomorrow.

551
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:21,642
You must take all orders from A4.

552
01:11:21,722 --> 01:11:22,803
Yes chief.

553
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:12,653
What a nice room!

554
01:12:14,094 --> 01:12:16,216
Our chief is always concerned that

555
01:12:16,296 --> 01:12:20,420
every member will be settling
in comfortably.

556
01:12:22,062 --> 01:12:22,903
Can you tell me...

557
01:12:23,023 --> 01:12:25,465
what's my mission tomorrow?

558
01:12:27,387 --> 01:12:30,230
You'll know.

559
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:31,391
Get some rest.

560
01:12:58,218 --> 01:13:00,100
Now you could tell me?

561
01:13:00,581 --> 01:13:01,622
You have to kill someone.

562
01:13:01,742 --> 01:13:02,703
Kill someone?

563
01:13:03,704 --> 01:13:05,706
A special agent of the police.

564
01:13:05,826 --> 01:13:06,947
Where?

565
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:10,631
Should be here any minute.

566
01:13:14,635 --> 01:13:16,597
This is a special packet of cigarettes.

567
01:13:16,677 --> 01:13:19,119
One blow and poisonous needle
will be shot out

568
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:21,201
...victim will be dead in three minutes.

569
01:13:21,321 --> 01:13:22,522
I'll do it here?

570
01:13:42,062 --> 01:13:43,223
Action.

571
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:22,823
Excuse me can I borrow a light?

572
01:14:27,147 --> 01:14:29,670
I'm 009 there's a poisonous needle
inside.

573
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:31,872
Light up and act normal.

574
01:14:36,877 --> 01:14:38,999
Fake your death three minutes later
thank you.

575
01:15:05,465 --> 01:15:06,947
Congratulations on your first job
well done!

576
01:15:07,067 --> 01:15:08,789
Piece of cake.

577
01:15:12,072 --> 01:15:13,794
You were really calm.

578
01:15:13,874 --> 01:15:16,997
No wonder the chief thinks highly of you.

579
01:15:19,239 --> 01:15:20,200
How do you know that...

580
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,442
he's working for the police?

581
01:15:22,923 --> 01:15:24,765
Since he stepped off the plane we knew...

582
01:15:24,885 --> 01:15:26,847
he's here to investigate us.

583
01:15:26,967 --> 01:15:28,448
You guys are really fierce!

584
01:15:31,852 --> 01:15:32,813
Have some wine.

585
01:15:34,494 --> 01:15:36,496
In the past we've had our oversight

586
01:15:36,617 --> 01:15:38,619
There was a fellow called Xu Zhicheng
who...

587
01:15:38,739 --> 01:15:41,021
infiltrated our society and revealed
our name list.

588
01:15:41,221 --> 01:15:44,585
Luckily I found out in time
and I shot him to death.

589
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:48,188
Well he should have known better.

590
01:15:48,548 --> 01:15:51,151
Exactly. If or not someone's a spy...

591
01:15:51,271 --> 01:15:53,273
one can't escape my deft eye.

592
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:55,035
I can tell by just one look.

593
01:15:55,555 --> 01:16:00,320
In that case am I a spy?

594
01:16:02,322 --> 01:16:05,245
If you are a spy then you...

595
01:16:05,325 --> 01:16:08,128
Then you'll shoot me to death.

596
01:16:08,248 --> 01:16:09,249
Right?

597
01:16:10,771 --> 01:16:13,574
Of course not I trust you completely.

598
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:16,416
Even if you were a spy
but being such a beauty

599
01:16:16,496 --> 01:16:18,218
I wouldn't want to kill you.

600
01:16:18,298 --> 01:16:19,299
Thanks.

601
01:16:25,786 --> 01:16:28,268
Luo Na are you willing to devote
yourself...

602
01:16:28,348 --> 01:16:29,830
to the Dark Angels?

603
01:16:30,671 --> 01:16:32,793
Of course.

604
01:16:32,873 --> 01:16:35,756
Are you suspecting me?

605
01:16:38,999 --> 01:16:43,283
No but I have another challenge for you.

606
01:16:43,403 --> 01:16:44,925
A challenge?

607
01:16:45,045 --> 01:16:47,768
You should know that I find you
very attractive.

608
01:16:51,491 --> 01:16:53,453
Don't do that.

609
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:56,737
You can't force me.

610
01:16:56,857 --> 01:17:00,300
Fine then. Truce?

611
01:17:23,003 --> 01:17:24,004
What are you doing?

612
01:17:29,089 --> 01:17:30,731
None of your business.

613
01:17:30,851 --> 01:17:31,732
You...

614
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:01,421
Stop it.

615
01:19:07,067 --> 01:19:08,629
He...

616
01:19:28,929 --> 01:19:30,651
Send Luo Na to her room.

617
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:31,571
Yes.

618
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:00,400
Chief.

619
01:20:06,566 --> 01:20:09,810
I beg you to forgive me.

620
01:20:10,570 --> 01:20:12,653
Please spare me just once.

621
01:20:17,337 --> 01:20:18,218
Get rid of him.

622
01:20:18,298 --> 01:20:19,179
Yes.

623
01:20:32,272 --> 01:20:35,035
Are you sure that's my box?

624
01:20:36,076 --> 01:20:37,598
So wicked.

625
01:20:48,528 --> 01:20:50,611
I never thought that...

626
01:20:50,731 --> 01:20:52,933
they'd trick you into this.

627
01:20:53,053 --> 01:20:55,495
I wouldn't let you join if I knew.

628
01:20:55,616 --> 01:20:57,778
What should I do?

629
01:20:58,699 --> 01:21:00,661
I've already joined.

630
01:21:01,902 --> 01:21:04,665
The rule is one can't leave
without orders.

631
01:21:04,785 --> 01:21:05,946
But if you really want to go

632
01:21:06,066 --> 01:21:07,988
...I can think of a way.

633
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:11,672
But where can I hide?

634
01:21:11,792 --> 01:21:13,393
Even if I can get out

635
01:21:13,513 --> 01:21:15,876
the men who worked for that Baldie
are still after me.

636
01:21:16,116 --> 01:21:18,038
Even if they can't find me

637
01:21:18,118 --> 01:21:20,280
...what will I live on?

638
01:21:25,285 --> 01:21:27,888
Dolly's right.

639
01:21:29,249 --> 01:21:33,694
Gotten myself in a dead end; no way out!

640
01:21:37,898 --> 01:21:39,019
Luo Na.

641
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:43,664
I'm surrounded by enemies.

642
01:21:43,784 --> 01:21:46,266
Only you are on my side.

643
01:21:47,868 --> 01:21:52,232
Tiehu I know that you love me.

644
01:21:52,312 --> 01:21:56,877
You're my only friend
I want you to protect me.

645
01:21:56,997 --> 01:21:58,238
Don't worry.

646
01:21:58,358 --> 01:22:01,241
I won't let you get hurt.

647
01:22:12,332 --> 01:22:14,414
The chief told you to take this.

648
01:22:14,534 --> 01:22:16,937
It'd counter the anesthetic's effect.

649
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:17,858
Thanks.

650
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:20,581
You must be tired get some rest.

651
01:28:13,934 --> 01:28:15,656
Where were you?

652
01:28:16,897 --> 01:28:17,658
I...

653
01:28:17,738 --> 01:28:19,900
I asked you a question.

654
01:28:23,463 --> 01:28:25,305
I was in Tiehu's room.

655
01:28:26,226 --> 01:28:28,709
Really?

656
01:28:31,111 --> 01:28:32,232
Don't be scared.

657
01:28:32,352 --> 01:28:35,555
I wouldn't interfere in your
relationships.

658
01:28:44,564 --> 01:28:46,967
Come here Luo Na.

659
01:28:55,255 --> 01:28:56,857
I like you a lot.

660
01:28:56,977 --> 01:28:59,660
I won't treat you as a regular member

661
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:01,381
I'll trust you in an important position.

662
01:29:01,662 --> 01:29:03,864
I knew you would.

663
01:29:03,984 --> 01:29:06,306
Oh really?

664
01:29:06,426 --> 01:29:08,989
Because I'm pretty and I'm able.

665
01:29:09,069 --> 01:29:10,510
What else?

666
01:29:10,631 --> 01:29:14,755
Because I am in a dead end.

667
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:18,238
It's my only chance to shine working
for you.

668
01:29:18,318 --> 01:29:21,602
That's right you will be rewarded.

669
01:29:21,682 --> 01:29:23,604
When all the representatives
from different...

670
01:29:23,684 --> 01:29:25,165
countries are here for the meeting

671
01:29:25,285 --> 01:29:26,767
...l'll tell the others about you.

672
01:29:26,887 --> 01:29:28,649
Thanks chief.

673
01:29:28,729 --> 01:29:29,690
Your second job...

674
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:32,613
is to attend a swimsuit show.

675
01:29:32,693 --> 01:29:34,695
A swimsuit show?

676
01:29:34,775 --> 01:29:38,178
Only those I think high will be
assigned to this job.

677
01:29:44,064 --> 01:29:45,385
The rule here is

678
01:29:45,465 --> 01:29:47,988
you can't tell anyone else about
our conversation.

679
01:29:48,068 --> 01:29:48,949
Sure.

680
01:30:11,692 --> 01:30:13,934
What were you doing? Napping?

681
01:30:14,054 --> 01:30:15,095
No.

682
01:30:38,318 --> 01:30:39,680
C7.

683
01:30:42,162 --> 01:30:43,283
Here.

684
01:30:44,244 --> 01:30:46,126
Was Luo Na in your room earlier?

685
01:30:46,246 --> 01:30:47,407
Earlier?

686
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:50,450
She said that she was with you.

687
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:52,332
She...

688
01:30:52,452 --> 01:30:54,975
Tell me is that true?

689
01:30:55,936 --> 01:30:58,098
Yes what's the matter?

690
01:30:58,218 --> 01:30:58,979
Nothing.

691
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:18,759
Where were you?

692
01:31:18,879 --> 01:31:19,680
I...

693
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,401
Where were you?

694
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,930
Why did you tell the chief that
you were with me?

695
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:40,540
What's going on with you?

696
01:31:42,382 --> 01:31:45,545
I couldn't sleep...

697
01:31:47,507 --> 01:31:50,791
and I sneaked into the chief's office.

698
01:31:50,871 --> 01:31:51,952
What for?

699
01:31:54,034 --> 01:31:57,598
I wanted to find my jewellery box.

700
01:31:57,718 --> 01:31:59,039
Did anyone see you?

701
01:31:59,479 --> 01:32:00,721
No.

702
01:32:01,241 --> 01:32:03,003
I didn't get any work done.

703
01:32:03,083 --> 01:32:05,525
I warn you this place is full of traps.

704
01:32:05,646 --> 01:32:07,567
You can get killed easily.

705
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:09,089
Don't run around like that anymore.

706
01:32:09,209 --> 01:32:11,211
But my jewels...

707
01:32:14,054 --> 01:32:15,776
We'll think of another plan.

708
01:32:17,377 --> 01:32:19,059
The chief was asking me about you earlier.

709
01:32:19,499 --> 01:32:21,742
She was waiting for me here.

710
01:32:23,023 --> 01:32:23,944
What does she want?

711
01:32:24,064 --> 01:32:25,906
She gave me a second job.

712
01:32:26,026 --> 01:32:28,428
She told me not to tell anyone

713
01:32:29,509 --> 01:32:32,512
but you know I won't keep any secrets
from you.

714
01:32:32,633 --> 01:32:35,636
I am to participate in a swimsuit show.

715
01:32:36,076 --> 01:32:37,678
A swimsuit show?

716
01:33:51,191 --> 01:33:52,593
Why her?

717
01:33:53,273 --> 01:33:54,995
She's more able than you.

718
01:34:18,899 --> 01:34:20,661
Why her?

719
01:34:20,781 --> 01:34:21,782
She's prettier than you.

720
01:35:43,303 --> 01:35:44,985
Don't shoot it's me.

721
01:35:47,347 --> 01:35:48,468
Bald Guy?

722
01:35:56,156 --> 01:35:57,557
You got out?

723
01:35:57,878 --> 01:35:58,599
Where's Tiehu?

724
01:35:58,679 --> 01:36:00,000
Tiehu?

725
01:36:00,721 --> 01:36:01,642
Hurry and tell him that...

726
01:36:01,762 --> 01:36:03,684
the Luo Na with him is a fake.

727
01:36:04,484 --> 01:36:05,445
A fake?

728
01:36:07,848 --> 01:36:09,529
The real one's been dead for two years.

729
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:11,011
Oh no!

730
01:36:11,692 --> 01:36:12,372
What?

731
01:36:12,492 --> 01:36:14,334
She infiltrated our group!

732
01:36:14,855 --> 01:36:16,456
She's an agent for the police
where is she?

733
01:36:16,576 --> 01:36:17,457
At the HQ.

734
01:36:17,537 --> 01:36:18,979
Hurry we must catch her.

735
01:36:19,099 --> 01:36:19,780
Sure.

736
01:36:24,024 --> 01:36:27,067
Presently I have some good news.

737
01:36:27,187 --> 01:36:29,029
According to our experts

738
01:36:29,149 --> 01:36:32,272
...our drug will be successful.

739
01:36:37,998 --> 01:36:41,481
We will have mass production of it

740
01:36:41,602 --> 01:36:45,205
the daily production to supply
a population of 100000

741
01:36:45,285 --> 01:36:49,049
We'll be controlling half of
the world's market share.

742
01:36:49,449 --> 01:36:52,132
Chief under your leadership

743
01:36:52,252 --> 01:36:53,654
...our society's growth is limitless.

744
01:36:53,934 --> 01:36:54,855
Three cheers for the chief!

745
01:36:55,295 --> 01:36:56,817
Hurray!

746
01:36:58,458 --> 01:37:00,821
Please take a look around.

747
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:12,873
This is an electronic oven.

748
01:37:53,714 --> 01:37:57,638
Let me introduce you our new member.

749
01:37:57,758 --> 01:37:58,799
Luo Na.

750
01:37:58,919 --> 01:37:59,760
Here.

751
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:03,203
You'll be A2 from now on.

752
01:38:03,283 --> 01:38:04,645
Yes.

753
01:38:05,165 --> 01:38:07,087
She'll be based in the HQ.

754
01:38:07,207 --> 01:38:09,449
If I'm not around

755
01:38:09,529 --> 01:38:11,571
...you can report to her.

756
01:38:11,692 --> 01:38:12,532
Yes.

757
01:38:12,653 --> 01:38:15,495
I've called this regional
representatives' meeting

758
01:38:15,616 --> 01:38:17,898
...to review what we've done;

759
01:38:18,018 --> 01:38:20,380
And to seek ways for bigger expansion.

760
01:38:22,142 --> 01:38:23,423
Look.

761
01:38:34,314 --> 01:38:36,156
In just a few years we have...

762
01:38:36,236 --> 01:38:38,879
already established branches
in so many places.

763
01:38:38,999 --> 01:38:40,721
Owing to the hard work of you all...

764
01:38:40,841 --> 01:38:42,282
our members will enjoy

765
01:38:42,402 --> 01:38:45,445
...the best lifestyle on earth.

766
01:38:45,565 --> 01:38:48,088
But I've found out that

767
01:38:48,208 --> 01:38:50,851
one of you hasn't been loyal.

768
01:38:55,736 --> 01:38:57,417
A16.

769
01:38:57,898 --> 01:39:00,580
You've made the biggest mistake...
you know?

770
01:39:00,661 --> 01:39:02,342
I...

771
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:05,505
From the portion of March collections...

772
01:39:05,626 --> 01:39:07,507
you've kept 100000 dollars to yourself.

773
01:39:07,628 --> 01:39:09,990
You've broken our rule.

774
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:11,792
You must be punished.

775
01:39:22,683 --> 01:39:24,885
If any of you think of making
the same mistake again

776
01:39:25,005 --> 01:39:27,848
...remember what happened to A16 today.

777
01:39:41,301 --> 01:39:44,344
Being a time of unrests in many places

778
01:39:44,464 --> 01:39:47,908
I think it's our chance to expand
our business.

779
01:39:48,028 --> 01:39:51,351
You must all work harder in
your own district.

780
01:40:02,242 --> 01:40:03,844
What is it Dolly?

781
01:40:03,964 --> 01:40:05,606
The Bald Guy wants to see you.

782
01:40:05,726 --> 01:40:08,288
I'm in a meeting ask him to wait.

783
01:40:08,408 --> 01:40:09,810
It's urgent.

784
01:40:09,890 --> 01:40:11,732
Please see us immediately.

785
01:40:45,405 --> 01:40:48,849
Alright game over. Stand up.

786
01:40:52,893 --> 01:40:53,934
What's going on?

787
01:40:54,294 --> 01:40:55,255
She's not Luo Na.

788
01:40:55,335 --> 01:40:56,697
She's works as a police...

789
01:41:02,062 --> 01:41:02,823
C7.

790
01:41:02,943 --> 01:41:03,664
Here.

791
01:41:03,784 --> 01:41:04,584
Come here right away.

792
01:41:04,665 --> 01:41:05,465
Yes.

793
01:41:16,036 --> 01:41:17,117
Chief.

794
01:41:17,237 --> 01:41:20,360
Tiehu it's all because of you.

795
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,883
You must get rid of her for me.

796
01:41:23,003 --> 01:41:23,924
Yes.

797
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:33,774
Never could guess you'd lie to me too!

798
01:41:44,865 --> 01:41:47,828
Why are you all so nervous?

799
01:41:48,548 --> 01:41:51,031
I wouldn't be here if I was scared.

800
01:41:51,111 --> 01:41:53,273
Who are you?

801
01:41:54,715 --> 01:41:56,316
I'm 009.

802
01:41:56,436 --> 01:41:58,038
Who else is working with you here?

803
01:41:58,158 --> 01:41:59,800
No one;

804
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:03,003
But there'll be plenty who'll die with me.

805
01:42:03,123 --> 01:42:03,964
How come?

806
01:42:04,044 --> 01:42:06,526
I've set up a time bomb.

807
01:42:06,647 --> 01:42:09,810
You'll all die with me.

808
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:11,571
Don't panic.

809
01:42:12,693 --> 01:42:13,814
Where is it?

810
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:17,137
Don't even dream that I'll tell you.

811
01:42:17,257 --> 01:42:18,058
Fine.

812
01:42:18,899 --> 01:42:20,460
You want to blow up my HQ

813
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:24,464
...you'll know what I'm made of.
Tie her up.

814
01:42:49,409 --> 01:42:50,490
Golden Bay.

815
01:42:55,055 --> 01:42:55,535
Get ready.

816
01:42:55,656 --> 01:42:56,697
Yes.

817
01:42:58,418 --> 01:42:59,379
We're going now.

818
01:43:34,334 --> 01:43:36,416
You won't die a quick death.

819
01:43:36,496 --> 01:43:40,100
Only you'll know when the bomb will blow.

820
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:42,262
Sit here and enjoy!

821
01:43:44,625 --> 01:43:46,106
Let's go chief.

822
01:43:46,707 --> 01:43:48,909
Be calm when we're heading out.

823
01:43:49,029 --> 01:43:50,150
Don't create a commotion.

824
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:50,991
Yes.

825
01:43:51,071 --> 01:43:53,393
What about the other members?

826
01:43:53,473 --> 01:43:55,195
No big deal!

827
01:43:55,275 --> 01:43:56,276
Who cares!

828
01:44:36,156 --> 01:44:37,958
Fifteen more minutes to go.

829
01:44:38,038 --> 01:44:38,879
What should we do?

830
01:44:40,681 --> 01:44:41,642
That way... hurry.

831
01:44:47,167 --> 01:44:48,488
No more protective suits.

832
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:51,211
Forget it. Let's climb through on top.

833
01:45:57,317 --> 01:45:57,998
Which way?

834
01:45:58,118 --> 01:45:59,039
That way.

835
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:00,480
I've got the chief's permission.

836
01:46:00,601 --> 01:46:01,401
No.

837
01:46:32,873 --> 01:46:33,754
Careful of the machines.

838
01:46:33,834 --> 01:46:34,675
Sure.

839
01:47:24,925 --> 01:47:28,849
The police is here...

840
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:33,453
Don't shoot...

841
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:44,865
Upstairs! Hurry!

842
01:48:02,242 --> 01:48:03,043
Come on.

843
01:48:14,655 --> 01:48:16,256
Have you seen Tiehu and Luo Na?

844
01:48:16,376 --> 01:48:17,257
No.

845
01:48:17,337 --> 01:48:19,419
No? Hurry we must catch them.

846
01:48:19,499 --> 01:48:21,261
Hurry go!

847
01:48:30,631 --> 01:48:31,752
What are you doing down here?

848
01:48:31,832 --> 01:48:34,274
She's new I'm just showing her around.

849
01:48:34,394 --> 01:48:36,717
What's to see in such a dirty place?

850
01:49:35,535 --> 01:49:36,977
Be careful.

851
01:49:38,178 --> 01:49:40,060
Have you seen them? Come on.

852
01:49:41,982 --> 01:49:42,703
Go that way.

853
01:49:42,823 --> 01:49:43,904
Go.

854
01:49:50,711 --> 01:49:51,191
You go that way.

855
01:49:51,271 --> 01:49:52,392
Go.

856
01:50:00,721 --> 01:50:01,441
Come.

857
01:50:14,975 --> 01:50:15,856
That way.

858
01:50:18,218 --> 01:50:19,179
A snake!

859
01:50:34,594 --> 01:50:35,515
Let's go.

860
01:51:16,156 --> 01:51:17,397
Look chief.

861
01:51:32,052 --> 01:51:33,814
Look!

862
01:51:36,176 --> 01:51:37,177
Shoot them.

863
01:51:54,034 --> 01:51:55,115
Tiehu.

864
01:51:55,235 --> 01:52:00,400
Don't move...

865
01:52:06,446 --> 01:52:07,447
Ai Si are you alright?

866
01:52:07,567 --> 01:52:09,610
I'm fine but they're really violent!

867
01:52:09,690 --> 01:52:12,292
No but you did a good job.

868
01:52:22,102 --> 01:52:23,904
Inform the marine police to
intercept the yacht.

869
01:52:24,024 --> 01:52:24,344
Yes sir.

870
01:52:24,424 --> 01:52:25,465
There's no need to.

871
01:52:27,587 --> 01:52:28,588
Just a few more seconds.

872
01:52:28,709 --> 01:52:29,710
A few more seconds?

873
01:52:32,192 --> 01:52:33,353
Look.
