Who?

181
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:26,981
Next.

182
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:30,528
Cammi, we realized all
look like Dylan.

183
00:15:31,123 --> 00:15:31,923
I. ..

184
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:34,942
I do not want to be mean, but ...

185
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,626
you're not her type.

186
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:41,644
I'll I'm just saying ... as a friend.

187
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:45,161
I do not want to see you hurt.

188
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:47,701
Friends?

189
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:58,154
It 's the right time
'cause my partner Carl,

190
00:15:58,274 --> 00:16:00,490
is doing the nap.
It was his turn.

191
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,943
So 'a good time.
The snake has just eaten.

192
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,531
We enter through this door.

193
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:07,215
Ouch. Revenue.

194
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:10,054
- I can not wait to see it.
- Right here.

195
00:16:10,174 --> 00:16:13,974
Tuck here. Make space.
There 'room for everyone. Plenty of space.

196
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:16,826
Revenue. Next, you, put your '.

197
00:16:17,297 --> 00:16:18,197
It's okay.

198
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:28,410
Shh, stand still.

199
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,327
The snake should not be awakened.

200
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:40,661
Observed.

201
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:45,747
The reptilian brain has much
in common with the DNA

202
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,017
of humans.

203
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,308
It's about the human ...

204
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:52,493
But maybe you and 'evolved
much more 'than humans

205
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:55,870
in terms of animal intelligence ...

206
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:59,250
- Oh, please.
- And ability 'to survive

207
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:00,947
and perhaps even

208
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,330
conquer the man!

209
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:07,814
Who 'really the animal more'
smart on planet earth?

210
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:10,135
Ask yourself this question!

211
00:17:11,743 --> 00:17:13,621
And here's to you Pete,

212
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:15,769
the giant snake.

213
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:18,988
Oh God!

214
00:17:19,225 --> 00:17:21,724
Pete, what did you eat?
Have you eaten Carl!

215
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:23,667
Oh my God, look,
Pete and 'alive!

216
00:17:23,787 --> 00:17:25,468
Look, and 'alive!

217
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:27,542
Carl! And 'real!

218
00:17:29,272 --> 00:17:30,022
Live!

219
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:32,384
Oh, his tail is moving.

220
00:17:32,504 --> 00:17:34,700
It was worth it
for $ 2, come on.

221
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,220
It 's alive, look!
It 's just a trick.

222
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,390
It 'really a bad snake!

223
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:44,722
Hey, now go back.

224
00:17:44,842 --> 00:17:48,092
It 'a joke, come on.
Will remember for a lifetime.

225
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:58,128
Hey guys, what are you doing?

226
00:18:00,117 --> 00:18:01,417
Open the door.

227
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,648

Open the door.

230
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:12,971
Guys?

231
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:17,171
Guys, open the door!

232
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,828
Guys, there is' something in here!

233
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:23,333
Guys, come on! Open the door!
It's not 'fun!

234
00:18:25,962 --> 00:18:27,829
Guys, open the door!

235
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:30,490
Open the door!

236
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:45,391
I open it for you.

237
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:47,563
Ouch.

238
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:54,167
Adam?

239
00:18:56,707 --> 00:18:57,457
Adam?

240
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:11,375
Oh, you were the 'inside?

241
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,101
Now you're screwed.

242
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:16,412
Come on, brother, you were
just messing with you.

243
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,167
Are you okay?

244
00:19:19,463 --> 00:19:21,007
Friend! Hey!

245
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:22,505
Come on, man.

246
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,515
This damn door
I redid the manicure.

247
00:19:25,635 --> 00:19:27,994
- Paint on the fingers, splinters ...
- Damn!

248
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:31,628
- Come on, you've never made a joke?
- I am a bit 'jealous.

249
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:35,405
Sometimes you're idiots
guys, I swear.

250
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:38,325
Look, I'm the 5 and 'the first ...

251
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,309
What the hell '?

252
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:43,451
A grain of corn,
I think it's a grain of corn.

253
00:19:43,571 --> 00:19:45,295
- Come on, brother.
- It's about time!

254
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:48,415
Jack, I told you
not to eat that stuff.

255
00:19:59,594 --> 00:20:01,844
Hey Taylor, I have to drive, moved.

256
00:20:05,012 --> 00:20:06,262
Get out of there '.

257
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:09,071
Hey, guys!

258
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,058
Hey, guys!

259
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:12,782
Hey ...

260

what ... what '?

261
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,248
Well ', I was' behind
to listen to my C.B.

262
00:20:17,368 --> 00:20:20,568
and it seems that someone
was killed on the highway.

263
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:25,436
And now all traffic
flows up to Corn County.

264
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:28,788
- Accident?
- No, someone did that to pieces.

265
00:20:29,316 --> 00:20:31,188
E 'was slain really well.

266
00:20:31,308 --> 00:20:32,658
And if I were you,

267
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,214
I would change the road.

268
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,970
Unless you
commitments for a month or two.

269
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:41,105
Hey, guys,
someone 'was killed.

270
00:20:41,225 --> 00:20:41,975
What?

271
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,359
Well ', he killed?
Maybe we should leave.

272
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:08,007
Well, 'according to that nut them'

273
00:21:08,127 --> 00:21:10,527

We take the back roads.

- I want these in central, okay?
- I got it.

276

At the lake or to the spa?

00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,081
To the lake. We have a guardian

I need to check the tires.

299

We should go home.

Madison, had a gun. If
wanted food, we would have taken it.

338
00:26:32,043 --> 00:26:35,043
It has no right to stop us.
It's not 'her the way.

339

900
01:16:46,909 --> 01:16:49,809
But I killed my real father ,
a long time ago .

901
01:16:51,321 --> 01:16:53,221
Once I had a sister.

902
01:16:54,302 --> 01:16:55,602
A half-sister .

903
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:58,712
What about you?

904
01:16:59,242 --> 01:17:00,692
Of your family?

905
01:17:00,892 --> 01:17:03,042
I had an older brother ' old ...

906
01:17:03,983 --> 01:17:05,283
A half-brother .

907
01:17:05,898 --> 01:17:06,848
E ' dead!

908
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:09,060
My sister ...

909
01:17:09,685 --> 01:17:11,235
dirono she was dead.

910
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:13,720
They said he was dead.

911
01:17:13,885 --> 01:17:17,135
And I know that if I
still have a chance ' to see her,

912
01:17:17,861 --> 01:17:19,711
put things in order .

913
01:17:21,331 --> 01:17:22,672
I found you.

914
01:17:26,435 --> 01:17:29,287
Please tell me
why ' of your nickname.

915
01:17:32,985 --> 01:17:35,235
She used to sing a little song .

916
01:17:37,425 --> 01:17:39,736
The little spider # #

917
01:17:40,441 --> 01:17:42,883
# Upgrade ' on the gutter #

918
01:17:44,342 --> 01:17:46,881
It was the # rain #

919
01:17:47,898 --> 01:17:50,696
# And the spider fell down ' ... #

920
01:17:51,841 --> 01:17:52,941
Oh , my God!

921
01:18:01,484 --> 01:18:03,834
You're the one that kept me on track.

922
01:18:04,463 --> 01:18:05,113
You.

923
01:18:07,445 --> 01:18:08,245
Cammi .

924
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,550
You took away .

925
01:18:12,975 --> 01:18:14,625
You took away from me.

926
01:18:18,185 --> 01:18:19,835
Now I can not stop it.

927
01:18:20,735 --> 01:18:21,885
You have to figure it out.

928
01:18:23,237 --> 01:18:25,485
They ...
tried to stop me.

929
01:18:26,463 --> 01:18:28,012
But do not stop.

930
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:30,119
Enough, enough , enough!

931
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:33,057
What are you doing ?
Cammi !

932
01:18:35,928 --> 01:18:36,728
Cammi !

933
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,450

938
01:18:59,383 --> 01:19:01,033

939
01:19:06,662 --> 01:19:07,512
Spider.

940
01:19:09,593 --> 01:19:10,981
You ' , it ' .

943
01:19:58,548 --> 01:19:59,398
Oh , no!

944
01:20:03,741 --> 01:20:04,541
Dylan.

945
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:07,009
No.

946
01:20:12,847 --> 01:20:13,497

What ... what happens?

950
01:21:11,518 --> 01:21:12,718
I had to stop .

951
01:21:14,949 --> 01:21:16,403
You are a danger to driving.

952
01:21:17,963 --> 01:21:20,113
I can not stop looking at you.

953
01:21:22,553 --> 01:21:23,603

01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:35,781
Are you at home.

that my brother was dead,

965
01:22:04,922 --> 01:22:06,422

966
