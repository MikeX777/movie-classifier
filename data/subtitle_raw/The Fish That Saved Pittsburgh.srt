361
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,866
THEY'RE ASTROLOGICALLY INCOMPATIBLE.

362
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,000
THEY'RE WHAT?

363
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:43,666
ZODIAC, MAN.

369
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,066

SLOW DOWN. SLOW DOWN.

A ROOSTER AND SOME HENS.

382
00:17:18,366 --> 00:17:20,233
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE ROOSTER.

THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CHICKENS.

384
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:24,833

385
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,866
GET RID OF THE CHICKENS.

386

TYRONE, WHAT MADE YOU THINK I'D POSSIBLY GO FOR THIS?

394
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,366

1604
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,966
I'VE OFTEN SAID THIS, FRIESMAN,

1605
01:12:53,033 --> 01:12:55,266
THAT WEALTH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD.

1606
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:56,866
BUT IT ISN'T THE MOST IMPORTANT

1607
01:12:56,933 --> 01:12:58,066
UNLESS YOU'RE HAVING FUN!

1608
01:12:58,133 --> 01:13:00,366
AND I INTEND TO HAVE FUN TONIGHT.

1609
01:13:00,433 --> 01:13:03,133
THE MOST IMPORTANT FUN IN THE WORLD!

1610
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,266
TONIGHT, THE WORLD IS YOURS, MR. TILSON.

1611
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:09,166
WELL, LET'S SEE.

1612
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:11,766
GIVE ME ABOUT TWO HOURS,

1613
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:13,733
AND I'LL HAVE THAT OLD WORLD

1614
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,900
RIGHT THERE IN THE PALM OF MY HAND.

1615
01:13:16,966 --> 01:13:18,833
TONIGHT, FRIESMAN,

1616
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:22,066
THERE'S GOING TO BE AN OLD-FASHIONED FISH FRY!

1617
01:13:22,133 --> 01:13:23,900
GOD DAMN.

1618
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:26,833
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

1619
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:29,166
THE LOS ANGELES TEAM.

1620
01:13:29,233 --> 01:13:31,200
[MUSIC PLAYS]

1621
01:15:16,066 --> 01:15:17,400
MMM! MMM!

1622
01:15:17,466 --> 01:15:18,866
MMM!

1623
01:15:55,533 --> 01:15:57,066
MR. COMMISSIONER,

1624
01:15:57,133 --> 01:15:58,400
I JUST, UH, WANT YOU TO HAVE

1625
01:15:58,466 --> 01:16:00,066
THIS SPECIFIC BALLOON.

1626
01:16:00,133 --> 01:16:01,433
THEY'RE ALL BASICALLY THE SAME.

1627
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,300
HAVE PISCES THE FISH THAT I DESIGNED,

1628
01:16:03,366 --> 01:16:04,866
ALSO MY NAME'S ON THIS.

1629
01:16:04,933 --> 01:16:06,266
I SIGNED THIS MYSELF.

1630
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:09,466
I MEAN, LITERALLY SIGNED OVER 30,000 OF THEM.

1631
01:16:09,533 --> 01:16:12,100
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, TILSON.

1632
01:16:38,566 --> 01:16:40,366
IT IS AN INCREDIBLE SCENE

1633
01:16:40,433 --> 01:16:41,500
HERE IN PITTSBURGH.

1634
01:16:41,566 --> 01:16:43,233
A CAPACITY CROWD IS ON HAND,

1635
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,733
AND THEY ARE VIEWING ONE OF

1636
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,833
THE STIRRING MOMENTS IN SPORTS.

1637
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,400
IT IS A SPORTS HAPPENING.

1638
01:16:48,466 --> 01:16:50,866
THERE IS PANDEMONIUM ALL AROUND ME.

1639
01:16:50,933 --> 01:16:52,366
INCREDIBLE! AS THE PISCES

1640
01:16:52,433 --> 01:16:54,733
MAKE THEIR WAY FROM THE SKY!

1641
01:18:29,433 --> 01:18:30,700
GET THEM, MOSES!

1642
01:18:30,766 --> 01:18:31,933
PARTY, FISH!

1643
01:18:39,166 --> 01:18:40,100
LET'S GO, PISCES!

1644
01:18:40,166 --> 01:18:41,166
WHERE THE HELL IS MONA?

1645
01:18:41,233 --> 01:18:43,233
WHAT TIME HAVE YOU GOT?

1646
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:44,266
[SET SHOT] ALL RIGHT.

1647
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:45,866
WHERE THE HELL IS SHE?

1648
01:18:45,933 --> 01:18:47,266
THANKS, TY.

1649
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:48,966
HOW COME NO MO?

1650
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,066
LORD, GIVE US A SIGN.

1651
01:18:52,133 --> 01:18:53,333
FELLAS,

1652
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,333
THE DEVIL IS LOOSE TONIGHT.

1653
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,866
I HEARD THAT, MAN.

1654
01:18:55,933 --> 01:18:58,200
WITHOUT MONA, MAN, I THINK IT'S DEAD.

1655
01:18:58,266 --> 01:18:59,466
MONA'S NOT HERE?

1656
01:18:59,533 --> 01:19:01,266
ALL RIGHT, MEN, LET'S LIGHTEN UP.

1657
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:02,600
LIGHTEN UP. NOW, THE STARTING--

1658
01:19:02,666 --> 01:19:04,200
STARTING LINEUP ON THE BENCH. ALL RIGHT?

1659
01:19:04,266 --> 01:19:05,433
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1660
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,833
ALL RIGHT, NOW,

1661
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:10,000
WE MAY NOT HAVE MONA, BUT...

1662
01:19:10,066 --> 01:19:11,133
WE'VE STILL GOT HER CHAIR.

1663
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,033
ALL WE HAVE TO DO

1664
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:14,233
IS EXECUTE.

1665
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:16,866
WE HAVE TO EXECUTE OUR GAME PLAN.

1666
01:19:16,933 --> 01:19:19,133
WE HAVE TO EXECUTE BALL CONTROL.

1667
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,200
MEN, THE NAME OF THE GAME TONIGHT

1668
01:19:21,266 --> 01:19:22,200
IS EXECUTION.

1669
01:19:22,266 --> 01:19:25,100
[STARTING HORN]

1670
01:19:26,533 --> 01:19:30,266
MEN, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO SAY--

1671
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:32,433
IF THERE'S NO TONIGHT, THERE'S NO TOMORROW.

1672
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,933
IF MONA WERE HERE,

1673
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,866
WE ALL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT SHE'D SAY. HUH?

1674
01:19:36,933 --> 01:19:37,966
HUH?

1675
01:19:38,033 --> 01:19:39,333
I THINK THAT SAYS IT ALL.

1676
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,266
ALL RIGHT?

1677
01:19:40,333 --> 01:19:41,266
PISCES FISTS.

1678
01:19:41,333 --> 01:19:42,400
O.K., LET'S GO.

1679
01:19:42,466 --> 01:19:44,033
I'LL BE HERE IF YOU NEED ME.

1680
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:45,433
PISCES GOT THE POWER.

1681
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:46,566
POWER TO THE FISH.

1682
01:19:46,633 --> 01:19:49,066
OUR FISH, FISH...

1683
01:19:49,133 --> 01:19:50,966
HELLO AGAIN, EVERYBODY,

1684
01:19:51,033 --> 01:19:52,433
FROM COURTSIDE THIS IS CHICK HEARN WELCOMING YOU

1685
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,100
TO THE LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.

1686
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:56,966
LOS ANGELES AGAINST THE PITTSBURGH PISCES.

1687
01:19:57,033 --> 01:19:58,900
WHAT A GAME IT SHOULD BE.

1688
01:19:58,966 --> 01:20:00,433
LOS ANGELES WITH PEOPLE LIKE KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR,

1689
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,200
CONNIE HAWKINS, LOU HUDSON, NORM NIXON,

1690
01:20:02,266 --> 01:20:04,200
LUCIEN TUCKER-- ALL TO CHALLENGE

1691
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:06,933
MOSES GUTHRIE AND HIS TEAMMATES.

1692
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,133
LOS ANGELES CONTROLS THE TIP.

1693
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,866
A HOOK SHOT NO GOOD FOR LOS ANGELES.

1694
01:20:16,933 --> 01:20:19,366
REBOUND IS TAKEN OFF THE RIM BY BULLET HAINES.

1695
01:20:19,433 --> 01:20:22,166
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PISCES TO HIT THE SCOREBOARD FIRST.

1696
01:20:22,233 --> 01:20:23,900
BOUNCE PASS COMES OVER TO GUTHRIE.

1697
01:20:23,966 --> 01:20:27,033
HIS PASS INTERCEPTED. NICE PLAY BY BILL PINE.

1698
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:28,933
NOW DOWN THE FLOOR THEY GIVE IT TO NORM NIXON,

1699
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,500
THEIR LITTLE POINT GUARD, AVERAGING 18.5 POINTS A GAME.

1700
01:20:31,566 --> 01:20:32,566
HE GOES TO THE FREE THROW LINE.

1701
01:20:32,633 --> 01:20:34,300
HIS 15-FOOTER IS GOOD!

1702
01:20:34,366 --> 01:20:37,033
AND LOS ANGELES IS IN FRONT 2 TO NOTHING.

1703
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,466
IN WHITE, THE PISCES ON THIS PSYCHEDELIC FLOOR.

1704
01:20:39,533 --> 01:20:41,200
ONE OF THE MOST UNUSUAL BASKETBALL FLOORS

1705
01:20:41,266 --> 01:20:43,233
MAN WILL EVER SEE.

1706
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,233
REVEREND JACKSON WITH IT.

1707
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:47,933
HIS PASS COMES INSIDE, BACK TO JACKSON.

1708
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,366
UNDERNEATH THE BASKET, TRAVELING IS CALLED.

1709
01:20:50,433 --> 01:20:52,166
OVERPASSING ON THE PLAY.

1710
01:20:52,233 --> 01:20:54,333
THE PISCES, THEY LOOK A LITTLE BIT TENSE.

1711
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,233
THEY CAME OUT IN A COUPLE OF THE GAMES

1712
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,533
IN THE PRELIMINARY ROUNDS OF THE PLAYOFFS THE SAME WAY,

1713
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:01,133
BUT RALLIED, AND HERE THEY ARE IN THE CHAMPIONSHIPS.

1714
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,900
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR,

1715
01:21:02,966 --> 01:21:05,266
A DOMINANT FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF BASKETBALL.

1716
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:08,500
AND OUTSIDE, LUCIEN TUCKER BURNS HIS EX-TEAMMATE.

1717
01:21:08,566 --> 01:21:10,566
DOESN'T HE LIKE THAT.

1718
01:21:10,633 --> 01:21:12,866
NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN TUCKER AND PARTICULARLY GUTHRIE.

1719
01:21:12,933 --> 01:21:15,066
LOU HUDSON KNOCKS THE BALL AWAY.

1720
01:21:15,133 --> 01:21:16,900
HIS TEAMMATE GETS THE BALL, AND THAT'S TUCKER.

1721
01:21:16,966 --> 01:21:18,433
DOWN THE FLOOR TO NIXON.

1722
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,100
BEAUTIFUL PASS UNDERNEATH TO RON CARTER.

1723
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:21,800
AND A SPINNING LAY-UP.

1724
01:21:21,866 --> 01:21:24,033
OH. A SENSATIONAL PLAY BY LOS ANGELES.

1725
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:28,033
BACK ON DEFENSE, THE 7'2" KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR.

1726
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,866
A LOT OF PUSHING AND SHOVING,

1727
01:21:29,933 --> 01:21:31,266
PARTICULARLY IN THAT 3-SECOND AREA.

1728
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:33,200
THE BALL COMES OUT IN FRONT.

1729
01:21:33,266 --> 01:21:34,900
THE PISCES PUT UP A SHOT, AND THEY DRILL IT HOME.

1730
01:21:34,966 --> 01:21:38,366
NICE SHOT OUT IN FRONT BY SET SHOT BUFFORD.

1731
01:21:38,433 --> 01:21:40,266
STOLEN. THEY HAVE THE BALL ONCE MORE COMING BACK,

1732
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:42,200
AND DOWN THE MIDDLE GOES LOS ANGELES.

1733
01:21:42,266 --> 01:21:43,333
A SLAM DUNK-- LUCIEN TUCKER.

1734
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,066
AND HE HAS A SMILE

1735
01:21:45,133 --> 01:21:47,100
AS HE COMES BACK DOWN THE FLOOR.

1736
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:50,133
O.K. I WANT YOU TO GET A NOTE OFF TO THE L.A. BOYS

1737
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,933
'CAUSE THEY'RE GONNA WIN, AND THEY'RE GONNA WIN BIG.

1738
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,600
I WANT TO SEND THEM SOME LITTLE GOODIES,

1739
01:21:54,666 --> 01:21:58,266
SOME, UH, SOMETHING IN THE ORDER OF A BASKETBALL,

1740
01:21:58,333 --> 01:22:00,233
MAYBE A PAPIER-MACHé WITH THEIR INITIALS ON IT.

1741
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:02,900
BE KIND OF CUTE... AND CHEAP.

1742
01:22:02,966 --> 01:22:06,166
UM, HOW ABOUT SOME EXOTIC FRUITS FROM THE ISLANDS?

1743
01:22:06,233 --> 01:22:07,300
OUR ISLANDS.

1744
01:22:07,366 --> 01:22:09,833
AND THIS--THIS IS UNIQUE.

1745
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,166
GET THIS DOWN.

1746
01:22:11,233 --> 01:22:13,166
BLACK THINGS FOR BLACK PLAYERS

1747
01:22:13,233 --> 01:22:15,200
AND WHITE THINGS FOR WHITE PLAYERS.

1748
01:22:15,266 --> 01:22:17,133
THAT WAY, WE HAVE NO PROBLEMS.

1749
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,366
THE LOS ANGELES CLUB WAS FAVORED COMING INTO THIS GAME,

1750
01:22:19,433 --> 01:22:21,166
DESPITE THE BRILLIANCE THIS YEAR,

1751
01:22:21,233 --> 01:22:22,333
IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE SEASON, AT LEAST,

1752
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,000
BY THE PISCES.

1753
01:22:24,066 --> 01:22:25,933
HERE'S SET SHOT BUFFORD AGAINST MITCHELL.

1754
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,900
TAKES IT OVER TO MOSES GUTHRIE.

1755
01:22:27,966 --> 01:22:30,233
GREAT PLAY! THE FIRST STEP BEAT LUCIEN TUCKER.

1756
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:32,200
AND NOW THEY ARE BUMPING HARD WITH ELBOWS.

1757
01:22:32,266 --> 01:22:34,033
AND SOMETHING BIG COULD COME OF THIS.

1758
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:35,333
LET'S HOPE NOT.

1759
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:36,400
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE EITHER MAN

1760
01:22:36,466 --> 01:22:37,533
EJECTED FROM THIS GAME.

1761
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,200
INTERCEPTION! JAMAAL TRUTH,

1762
01:22:39,266 --> 01:22:41,833
THE ARABIC HEADDRESS BLOWING IN THE BREEZE.

1763
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,866
HE'S GOT A SLAM DUNK! HE MISSED THE SHOT!

1764
01:22:43,933 --> 01:22:45,366
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH.

1765
01:22:45,433 --> 01:22:48,900
OH. WHAT A BIG PLAY IN THIS BALLGAME.

1766
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,800
LOOKS LIKE OUR CINDERELLA TEAM'S

1767
01:22:52,866 --> 01:22:54,866
ABOUT TO TURN INTO A PUMPKIN.

1768
01:22:56,366 --> 01:22:57,966
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

1769
01:22:58,033 --> 01:22:59,466
I SAID THE CINDERELLA TEAM'S

1770
01:22:59,533 --> 01:23:01,366
ABOUT TO CHANGE INTO A PUMPKIN.

1771
01:23:01,433 --> 01:23:03,033
IT'S A CRYIN' SHAME.

1772
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,500
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE PISCES

1773
01:23:04,566 --> 01:23:05,366
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PLAY BETTER...

1774
01:23:05,433 --> 01:23:07,366
CINDERELLA...

1775
01:23:07,433 --> 01:23:09,200
MIDNIGHT...

1776
01:23:09,266 --> 01:23:11,566
