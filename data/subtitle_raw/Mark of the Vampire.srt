1
00:02:15,278 --> 00:02:18,338
I'm sorry, gentleman and lady,

2
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:21,715
but it will be best for you
to stay here tonight.

3
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:24,446
Come now, my good man,
you can't frighten us.

4
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:26,614
We've been over your foul roads before.

5
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,953
Please, you do not understand.

6
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,687
It is not the road. It is the darkness.

7
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:35,761
Here our doors are protected
with bat thorns.

8
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:39,460
- What is all this bat thorn business?
- It keeps them out.

9
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:43,097
They're afraid of it,
the demons of the castle.

10
00:02:57,954 --> 00:03:01,219
Good evening. It's a lovely evening.

11
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:06,288
Well, Doctor,
for one who is not afraid of the dark,

12
00:03:06,362 --> 00:03:08,592
you have been pushing your horse
pretty fast.

13
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:10,895
Well, you know horses.

14
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:14,662
Once they get started for home,
there's no stopping them.

15
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:19,972
I admit I was a bit impatient...
I mean, hungry

16
00:03:20,043 --> 00:03:22,102
for one of your wonderful meals.

17
00:03:22,178 --> 00:03:25,909
Yes, the vampires are hungry, too,
for their supper.

18
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:31,312
Nonsense. Rubbish. Vampires. Nonsense.

19
00:03:32,355 --> 00:03:35,984
I won't keep you waiting.
I'll be right out for my supper.

20
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:40,091
He can "tut-tut" all he likes
about vampires,

21
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,731
but I'd hate to be on a farm
needing his help tonight.

22
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:47,360
- What is all this about vampires?
- Yes, and this castle.

23
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:50,868
That's where they live in their coffins.

24
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:54,774
And they come out at night
and drink people's blood.

25
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,445
Silly superstition.

26
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:02,712
You would not laugh
if you lived in these mountains.

27
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:05,845
Fancy, Ronnie,
vampires in the 20th century.

28
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:08,982
Ripping.
They'll never believe that at the club.

29
00:04:14,497 --> 00:04:16,397
She says, "Please do not mock.

30
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,866
"Because if the vampires should hear you,

31
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:21,699
"they would take their revenge
on all of us."

32
00:04:57,907 --> 00:05:01,900
<i>- Did you find out what was the matter?
- Monsieur Baron Otto is coming.</i>

33
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:05,414
One minute.
I have something to say to you.

34
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:10,051
I'm the bearer of very sad tidings.

35
00:05:11,454 --> 00:05:14,651
Last night your master, Sir Karell,
was murdered.

36
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:18,651
There's no cause for alarm.

37
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:20,758
Get up on your feet.

38
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:26,358
Police Inspector Neumann from Prague
is upstairs now with the body.

39
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:29,599
He'll be down here shortly
to question all of you.

40
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:33,130
Now, tell him the truth
and nothing can happen to you.

41
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:36,473
That's all. You can go back to your work.

42
00:05:39,248 --> 00:05:41,739
In the University of Prague
there are records,

43
00:05:41,818 --> 00:05:44,844
documents that prove the existence
of these creatures.

44
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:47,981
Dr. Doskil, I'm uninterested
in your old wives' tales.

45
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:50,116
I'm trying to find the cause
of Sir Karell's death.

46
00:05:50,193 --> 00:05:51,854
But you have it right here.

47
00:05:51,928 --> 00:05:55,989
These little wounds on his throat
are the bite of the vampire.

48
00:05:56,566 --> 00:06:00,297
- Yes, you said.
- I have seen such marks in these parts.

49
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,837
Sir Karell dismissed you at 9:15 last night.

50
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,065
Yes, Mr. Inspector, yes.

51
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,768
Then what were you doing down here
this morning at 3:30?

52
00:06:06,843 --> 00:06:09,710
I don't know. I couldn't sleep.

53
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:14,113
A bat was fluttering against my window,
and I felt something was wrong.

54
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:16,241
A bat made you feel that way?

55
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,085
Yes, sir. No, sir. I don't know.

56
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:26,655
And you, why didn't you come to
the castle at once when Jan telephoned?

57
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:29,391
Because Jan told me
Sir Karell was already dead.

58
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:32,866
Does your medical license admit Jan
to certify to the death of your patients?

59
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,869
Oh, no, no. Of course not.

60
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:38,134
But it was night, and I realized
there was nothing I could do.

61
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:43,008
Oh, I see. You're no moonflower.
You're a morning glory.

62
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,440
Now, if there's enough daylight
to bring out the physician in you,

63
00:06:47,517 --> 00:06:50,008
make a thorough examination of the body
for the cause of death.

64
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:52,577
Real, not supernatural.

65
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,490
Here, Jan, give the doctor a hand.

66
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,151
Why, the idea.

67
00:07:00,663 --> 00:07:03,427
I'll get your wrap, my dear.
We'll step over to my place.

68
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:06,093
- You've eaten nothing.
- Oh, the very thought of food.

69
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:07,431
I couldn't. I couldn't.

70
00:07:07,503 --> 00:07:10,404
But, Irena,
you must conserve your strength.

71
00:07:11,174 --> 00:07:13,506
- It's Fedor.
- My dear, I'll tell him.

72
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:15,066
No. No, thanks.

73
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:27,916
Oh, where have you been? I've been
making enough noise to raise the dead.

74
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,981
Oh, don't, Fedor. Don't.

75
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:32,918
Well, what's wrong, dear?
What's happened?

76
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:36,362
Fedor, Father's... Father...

77
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:40,166
Oh, you poor darling.

78
00:07:43,706 --> 00:07:46,800
This young man,
tell me something about him.

79
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,770
Who, Fedor? Miss Borotyn's fiancé,
Mr. Vincenté from Prague.

80
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:55,340
- His family, wealthy?
- Moderately. Why?

81
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:57,210
With Sir Karell out of the way

82
00:07:57,286 --> 00:07:59,117
Miss Borotyn will come into
quite a bit of money.

83
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,713
Why, surely you can't suspect Fedor?

84
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,620
What are Miss Borotyn's immediate plans?

85
00:08:05,127 --> 00:08:08,358
Why, naturally,
she'll be moving next door to my place,

86
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:10,228
I being her guardian.

87
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:13,097
- Oh, her guardian.
- Why, yes.

88
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:17,934
And being her guardian, naturally,
you'll be the sole executor of her estate.

89
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:19,941
Yes. Why, what's wrong?

90
00:08:20,977 --> 00:08:24,344
Oh, I see. I'm under suspición, too.

91
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,072
In such cases, everyone's under suspición.

92
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:31,586
The idea of talking to me as though
I were one of his common policemen.

93
00:08:32,655 --> 00:08:34,520
"Old wives' tales.

94
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,957
"Look for the cause of death.

95
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:40,223
"Real, not supernatural."

96
00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:54,576
- What? What is it?
- Look.

97
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:17,722
Well, Doctor, what have you found?

98
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,169
Inspector, the examination
fully confirms my diagnosis.

99
00:09:22,405 --> 00:09:25,169
Those marks are the only sign of violence.

100
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:26,973
Had Sir Karell been ailing of late?

101
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:29,409
No, on the contrary,
he enjoyed good health,

102
00:09:29,478 --> 00:09:31,503
except for a slightly sluggish heart.

103
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:34,311
- And you prescribed for that?
- Naturally.

104
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:38,581
- Well, I shall want an autopsy.
- Of course, that will be done.

105
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:42,920
But I am positive. The cause of his death
is told by those little wounds.

106
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:46,826
Well, surely, Doctor, a man of your
learning does not believe in vampires?

107
00:09:46,896 --> 00:09:51,128
Then how do you account for his body
being drained dry of blood?

108
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:54,860
Yes, Mr. Coroner.

109
00:09:55,371 --> 00:10:00,138
In the night, Farmer Narodni
was found dead in the road.

110
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:05,211
Count Mora and his daughter
were seen again near the castle.

111
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:08,079
Oh, piffle. Superstitious twaddle.

112
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:10,717
- Dr. Doskil.
- Yes?

113
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:13,550
You've examined the body
of this farmer, too?

114
00:10:13,723 --> 00:10:16,749
I did. The corpse was drained of blood.

115
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:20,824
There were the same marks
that I found on Sir Karell's throat.

116
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,195
And you have seen this Count Mora
and his daughter?

117
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,594
No, sir.

118
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:29,536
When I saw them,
they was in form of bats.

119
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:33,164
These poor deluded creatures believe

120
00:10:33,242 --> 00:10:36,075
that vampires change themselves
into bats

121
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:37,874
and back again into human forms.

122
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:40,472
- How versatile.
- Really, Mr. Coroner!

123
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,219
"Poor deluded creatures." I must protest.

124
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:48,880
- I hold a degree from the medical faculty...
- Sit down!

125
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:54,360
Do you want to make your township
and this court ridiculous?

126
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,161
Forget your absurd old superstitions.
This is 1934.

127
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:03,597
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think that under existing circumstances

128
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:08,171
the decisión of this inquest must be
that Sir Karell Borotyn

129
00:11:08,244 --> 00:11:11,577
met his death
from cause or causes unknown.

130
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:29,391
Darling, they're doing all this for you.
Doesn't it make you happy?

131
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:36,396
- What... Why, dear, you're crying.
- Boris, please drive on.

132
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:47,173
I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't mean to make you sad.

133
00:11:48,984 --> 00:11:51,544
Forgive me, Fedor, for being so moody,

134
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,250
but seeing them all dancing
suddenly brought it all back.

135
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,825
How Father used to tell me
that at my wedding feast

136
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:04,558
all the villagers and peasants
for miles around would come,

137
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:07,560
and they'd sing and dance.

138
00:12:09,672 --> 00:12:13,301
Fedor, he had it all planned.

139
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,344
Now he isn't here.

140
00:12:19,348 --> 00:12:24,081
Darling, I'll always try to make you
as happy as your father wanted you to be.

141
00:12:26,856 --> 00:12:30,383
The villagers and peasants would be quite
satisfied with wine of the country.

142
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,324
It is just what Sir Karell would have done.

143
00:12:32,394 --> 00:12:34,919
- Yes, sir, but for one thing.
- What's that?

144
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:38,194
He would have had the wedding feast
at the castle.

145
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:41,528
Come, Jan, do you think Miss Irena
could bear to go back there?

146
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:44,437
- After that dreadful tragedy?
- I suppose not, sir.

147
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:46,839
But it's heartbreaking
to see the place neglected,

148
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:49,878
rain and sleet entering
through the broken windows.

149
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:51,378
I know how you feel.

150
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:55,277
Recheck your list.
Be sure we've got enough of everything.

151
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,526
But you must remember life goes on,
my dear.

152
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:09,723
Your father wouldn't want these days,
of all days, to be clouded for you.

153
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:13,667
I know. I feel ashamed of the way
I acted with Fedor last night,

154
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:16,169
but it all seemed to sweep over me again.

155
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:18,672
Well, no more of that, young lady.

156
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:22,770
If I remember correctly,
we have a wedding to prepare for.

157
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:25,575
Fedor!
Fedor, oh, darling, what's the matter?

158
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:26,910
Annie, some water, quick!

159
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:29,712
What is it, Fedor? What happened to you?

160
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:32,849
I don't know. I can't remember.

161
00:13:33,956 --> 00:13:38,791
I was running to the train
and then, by the castle, I fell.

162
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:42,429
I must have struck my head.

163
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:45,126
Oh, you poor dear. Here, drink this.

164
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:47,395
Fedor.

165
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:50,033
You say you fell by the castle?

166
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:53,300
When I came to, it was dawn.

167
00:13:54,076 --> 00:13:55,976
I was too weak to move.

168
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:58,372
I just lay there.

169
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:03,314
It seems...
It seemed hours before I was able

170
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,518
to drag myself here.

171
00:14:05,588 --> 00:14:08,079
Annie, the doctor, quick. Dr. Doskil.

172
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:13,457
Fedor! Those wounds, like Father's.

173
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,495
Vampire! Vampire! Let me out of here!

174
00:15:39,882 --> 00:15:42,180
Slow down! Slower!

175
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:45,448
- Are you trying to kill me?
- Let go! Let go!

176
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:49,389
Slow down! Slow down!
I'm not gonna be upset in no ditch!

177
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:54,026
And I'm gonna tell the Baron
how you've been beating his horse.

178
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:56,997
It's all your fault,
taking so much time over your beer.

179
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:59,296
I told you we had to get home
before sunset.

180
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:02,701
Why are you afraid of the dark?
The darkness won't hurt us.

181
00:16:02,771 --> 00:16:07,231
If you wake up dead in the morning,
your body drained dry of blood,

182
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:09,600
you'll be afraid of the dark!

183
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:17,377
Afraid of the dark.

184
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,563
Heaven. Heaven, protect us. Oh, heaven.

185
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,495
I've been a good girl.
I've been a good girl all my life.

186
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:35,332
Don't let her get me.

187
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:38,432
She's got me! She's got me!

188
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:45,640
We must see him! We must see him!

189
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,740
- But you can't! You can't disturb him now!
- We've got to see him.

190
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:49,909
He must be told what we saw.

191
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:52,852
I must warn you.
You cannot disturb him now.

192
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:55,082
- What is this? What is this?
- The castle, sir!

193
00:16:55,157 --> 00:16:57,455
It's haunted, sir. Dead people!

194
00:16:57,526 --> 00:16:59,551
- Jan, close the door.
- We saw them! We saw them!

195
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:02,461
- Yes, we did, sir!
- Keep quiet. I'll explain.

196
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:05,830
- Some real-estate brokers from Prague...
- No, no. We saw a woman.

197
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:09,029
- A dead woman in her grave clothes.
- That's enough!

198
00:17:09,104 --> 00:17:12,301
What you probably saw was one of
the broker's clients inspecting the castle.

199
00:17:12,374 --> 00:17:13,773
The place is being shown for rent.

200
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:16,208
Oh, excuse me, sir. I'm new here.

201
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:18,871
I want no more disturbances in this house.

202
00:17:18,981 --> 00:17:20,414
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

203
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:22,609
Miss Irena has gone through
enough excitement.

204
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:25,881
No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll keep my tongue.

205
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:50,337
What is it? Boris!

206
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:55,736
Oh, Boris.

207
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:57,608
What happened to her?
What's she doing out here?

208
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,115
I don't know! I couldn't find her.
I looked all over and there...

209
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,276
I don't know! I don't know!

210
00:19:04,286 --> 00:19:07,119
I felt her deadly, cold breath on my throat.

211
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:10,020
I must have fainted.

212
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,493
I knew no more.

213
00:19:33,148 --> 00:19:37,175
Colleague, your diagnosis is correct.

214
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:38,844
Professor Zelin.

215
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,293
Gentlemen, I've spent my life
in the study of...

216
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:52,696
Miss Borotyn, will you excuse us, please?

217
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:57,597
May we continue our talk
in another room?

218
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:12,251
- Maid.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

219
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:16,491
Go to Miss Borotyn. Stay with her.

220
00:20:16,692 --> 00:20:20,560
- Under no circumstances leave her.
- No, sir.

221
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:25,698
Professor Zelin, why all this secrecy?

222
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:29,500
I broke off my sentence
for Miss Borotyn's sake.

223
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:34,700
There is no more foul or relentless
enemy of man

224
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,403
in the occult worid

225
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:41,415
than this dead-alive creature
spewed up from the grave.

226
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,183
True. True.

227
00:20:43,652 --> 00:20:47,486
This attack by a beautiful woman
on Miss Borotyn

228
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:51,485
goes far to confirm
the legend of the castle.

229
00:20:52,494 --> 00:20:55,088
Who else could it have been but...

230
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:57,961
- The daughter of Count Mora.
- Exactly.

231
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:00,661
My very own conclusión, Professor.

232
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:04,968
- What is your advice?
- We can't undo what's been done.

233
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:10,170
Miss Borotyn is in danger
of repeated attacks.

234
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:16,644
Come in, please.

235
00:21:21,523 --> 00:21:23,923
It's Inspector Neumann. Excuse me.

236
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:29,792
Baron Otto, I must speak
to Inspector Neumann before he leaves!

237
00:21:29,865 --> 00:21:32,163
Please. You should be lying down.

238
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:35,959
Miss Borotyn,
you must come away from there.

239
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:37,869
I'm afraid you treat me like an invalid.

240
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:41,170
Maid, quick. The doors, the windows.

241
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:44,610
I want everything
closed and fastened securely.

242
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,741
- Every moment counts. Run along now.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

243
00:21:49,785 --> 00:21:51,116
Dr. Doskil,

244
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,117
there's a certain thorny weed

245
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,750
- that grows in these parts.
- Yes, yes. Bat thorn.

246
00:21:57,826 --> 00:22:02,286
That's it. That's it. I want you
to get me some, if you will, please.

247
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:06,262
We'll have to work fast.
The sun will soon be down.

248
00:22:06,335 --> 00:22:08,326
Yes, yes. Very good, sir.

249
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:13,902
With my permissión,
a broker in Prague leased the castle.

250
00:22:13,975 --> 00:22:16,773
Look. Look at the signature of the tenant.

251
00:22:17,913 --> 00:22:21,644
Karell Borotyn. Some relative, no doubt.

252
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:25,278
- No, no, it's Karell himself.
- What's wrong with you, man?

253
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:26,685
Sir Karell's been dead for a year.

254
00:22:26,755 --> 00:22:29,155
It's his signature, I tell you.
I know it as well as my own.

255
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,089
Inspector Neumann.

256
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,924
Your arrival is providential.

257
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:39,293
We need his help the worst way.

258
00:22:39,668 --> 00:22:43,729
Inspector, Miss Borotyn has been attacked

259
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:45,568
by a vampire.

260
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:48,336
Well, I suppose coming from you
this is no joke.

261
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,105
But you know
I don't believe in such things.

262
00:22:50,178 --> 00:22:51,770
Why have you sent for me?

263
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:54,748
Why were you instrumental
in bringing me down here?

264
00:22:54,816 --> 00:22:57,410
Please, Professor, no argument.
I can't stand any more of this.

265
00:22:57,486 --> 00:23:00,387
- I'm too excited.
- I beg your pardon, Baron.

266
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:01,513
Sorry, Baron.

267
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,888
I'll tell you why
I brought you here, Professor.

268
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:05,586
I thought you'd help me uncover the truth.

269
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,892
Why, the facts speak for themselves.
There have been three attacks.

270
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:14,495
Sir Karell is dead.
Miss Borotyn and her fiancé

271
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:18,005
lie within the shadow of worse than death.

272
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:22,773
The vampire is a pestilence that grows.

273
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:25,035
Each victim that it kills

274
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:27,911
itself becomes a vampire.

275
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,846
A corpse by day,
at night it leaves its coffin

276
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:35,515
to sustain its unnatural life

277
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,559
on the blood of the living.

278
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,229
Inspector, we must protect this house
with bat thorn

279
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,289
to prevent their entrance.

280
00:23:45,934 --> 00:23:49,028
Baron, I have sent for a supply.

281
00:23:49,104 --> 00:23:52,596
If you will pardon me, I'll see if it's arrived.

282
00:23:55,343 --> 00:23:58,107
Inspector, do you really think...

283
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,240
Miss Borotyn,
you should not be down here.

284
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,281
You must not disregard my warnings.

285
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:09,221
But I heard a voice, outside, calling me.

286
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:11,782
It's your weakened condition, child.

287
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,853
No. No, it sounded like Father,
Father's voice.

288
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:18,764
Come. I'll take you back to your room.

289
00:24:19,801 --> 00:24:23,737
Did you hear what she said?
Her father's voice.

290
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:31,669
Hysteria. I place no stock in it.

291
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:36,508
His signature. His signature on that lease.

292
00:24:36,585 --> 00:24:39,110
Now don't you start believing
that nonsense.

293
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,781
Dead people don't leave their graves.

294
00:24:42,991 --> 00:24:47,724
But, Inspector, we must make sure
that Sir Karell's body is still in its coffin.

295
00:25:45,987 --> 00:25:50,185
Fedor, you're not well enough.
You promised me not to come tonight.

296
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:53,853
What are you trying to keep from me?
Who is this man?

297
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,926
Oh, I'm sorry.

298
00:25:56,298 --> 00:26:00,359
Professor Zelin. Professor, Mr. Vincenté.

299
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,730
You've been so ill, dear.
We thought it best not to let you know.

300
00:26:04,806 --> 00:26:07,866
- But now that you're here...
- Please, please.

301
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:10,138
You'll overtax your strength.

302
00:26:10,745 --> 00:26:12,178
Mr. Vincenté,

303
00:26:12,414 --> 00:26:16,009
Miss Borotyn must be spared
all excitement.

304
00:26:16,084 --> 00:26:19,076
She's passed through a terrible ordeal.

305
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:24,753
Like you,
she was attacked by the vampire.

306
00:26:24,826 --> 00:26:26,225
The vampire?

307
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,426
She must have rest.

308
00:26:29,497 --> 00:26:32,933
She'll get rest. I'm taking her
away from here tonight. Now!

309
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:34,628
Mr. Vincenté,

310
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,861
if you interfere with my plans,

311
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:40,002
if you disobey me,

312
00:26:40,508 --> 00:26:42,908
my work will be destroyed.

313
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,811
Why, it's not only your lives,

314
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:49,372
your souls are at stake.

315
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:52,449
We must all die.

316
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,683
There's nothing terrible about death,

317
00:26:55,757 --> 00:27:00,091
but to live on after death,

318
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:03,494
a soul earth-bound,

319
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:05,556
a vampire.

320
00:27:05,634 --> 00:27:08,933
You don't wish any such fate
for your beloved.

321
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:11,438
- No, of course not.
- Of course not.

322
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:14,737
- Then you must leave with me.
- I'm not leaving here.

323
00:27:16,044 --> 00:27:18,774
Please, dear. Do as he says.

324
00:27:20,048 --> 00:27:22,949
I'm so tired. Good night.

325
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:25,919
Maid, maid, come here, please.

326
00:27:25,987 --> 00:27:27,716
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

327
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:34,590
I want you and the butler
to place some of this bat thorn

328
00:27:34,663 --> 00:27:37,723
in every room on this floor.
You understand?

329
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,994
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Go along.

330
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:44,361
Come, young man.

331
00:27:49,644 --> 00:27:51,077
Don't do that.

332
00:27:51,446 --> 00:27:53,812
He wants some of this
put in every room in the house.

333
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:57,818
- Oh, yes, you?
- No, we.

334
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:05,116
The vampire's power prevails

335
00:28:05,193 --> 00:28:09,653
during the hours
between sunset and sunrise

336
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:12,825
- when it leaves its coffin.
- Professor.

337
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:18,338
- We've just come from Sir Karell's tomb.
- The coffin was empty.

338
00:28:19,641 --> 00:28:23,634
Help! Help!

339
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:31,075
- Irena! Irena!
- Fedor! Fedor!

340
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,815
- Darling. What happened?
- Oh, my dear.

341
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:36,288
What happened?

342
00:28:36,357 --> 00:28:37,984
Stop jittering. What are you trying to say?

343
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:40,550
Oh, it was terrible. It was awful.

344
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:43,893
- Quiet, please. One at a time.
- Speak up. Tell me what happened.

345
00:28:43,965 --> 00:28:48,061
Yes, sir. We were told to put
some of the bat thorn in every room.

346
00:28:48,136 --> 00:28:51,970
We had just come out of that door
and started down the hall...

347
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:55,440
I don't like it. It's a horrible business.

348
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,375
I wish he'd hung
the beastly stuff up himself.

349
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,345
We'll get it over with.

350
00:29:19,234 --> 00:29:23,000
- He was there. Coming towards us.
- Yes, yes.

351
00:29:23,872 --> 00:29:27,603
He had a white face, a dead white face,

352
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:29,399
with burning eyes

353
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:34,574
- and a ghastly wound on his head.
- It was Count Mora.

354
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:37,015
- Yes, yes.
- Have you been drinking?

355
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:38,950
No. No, sir.

356
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,778
If I have, I hope to choke on the next one.

357
00:29:43,758 --> 00:29:45,953
This is no time for levity.

358
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:51,323
The vampire,
he is still somewhere within this house.

359
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:56,302
Young man, place some bat thorn
at this door and lock it securely.

360
00:29:56,371 --> 00:29:58,805
- Yes, sir.
- Maid, butler,

361
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:01,232
search the rooms at that end of the house.

362
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:05,575
You mean go into those rooms?

363
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:07,547
- Yes, you idiot.
- Hurry.

364
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:10,879
Baron Otto,
we must drive him out of here.

365
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:14,410
Quick, Inspector,
we must search the rooms at this end.

366
00:30:17,058 --> 00:30:21,586
In that room, Baron.
Quick, Inspector, we've no time to lose.

367
00:30:28,303 --> 00:30:30,396
Maria, Maria, don't leave me.

368
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:34,000
- Inspector. Inspector, what is it?
- He got through the window.

369
00:30:34,075 --> 00:30:36,805
- Did you...
- Baron, Inspector, come here.

370
00:30:37,645 --> 00:30:41,046
- Please, quick.
- What is it, Professor? What is it?

371
00:30:41,683 --> 00:30:42,775
Look.

372
00:30:45,954 --> 00:30:49,583
Was that he? The last one?

373
00:30:49,657 --> 00:30:53,286
- Who?
- Sir Karell, her father.

374
00:30:53,361 --> 00:30:56,023
- Her father?
- Why, yes.

375
00:30:56,097 --> 00:30:59,089
Didn't you find his coffin empty?

376
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:02,694
No, no, I can't believe that.
I won't believe that.

377
00:31:03,171 --> 00:31:07,369
Inspector, please hurry.
Place this at these doors.

378
00:31:07,442 --> 00:31:09,239
I'll attend to the others.

379
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,744
- Professor.
- Baron, a moment.

380
00:31:12,614 --> 00:31:16,448
Baron, there are things going on
in this house that I don't like.

381
00:31:16,517 --> 00:31:19,008
- What do you mean?
- Well, this weed,

382
00:31:19,387 --> 00:31:22,447
the way the Professor's acting,
I don't like it.

383
00:31:22,891 --> 00:31:24,722
Well, I'm bewildered.

384
00:31:24,993 --> 00:31:26,392
I no longer know what to think.

385
00:31:26,794 --> 00:31:30,230
I'm afraid, Fedor, afraid to close my eyes.

386
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:34,428
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We'll be here with you, watching over you.

387
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:37,596
No, no, no. We must go.

388
00:31:37,672 --> 00:31:39,799
We can't remain here.

389
00:31:39,874 --> 00:31:43,810
She must have quiet.
She must have sleep.

390
00:31:43,878 --> 00:31:46,870
Her exhausted body demands it.

391
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:50,509
Miss Borotyn,
the maid will be here with you.

392
00:31:50,585 --> 00:31:53,076
But I dread every moment
between now and morning.

393
00:31:53,154 --> 00:31:56,021
Dismiss all fear from your mind.

394
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,718
The room is quite safe now.

395
00:32:36,397 --> 00:32:39,525
The organ. That music.
He was always at the organ.

396
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,034
Sounds like it comes from the dead.

397
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,201
This window.

398
00:33:18,673 --> 00:33:20,197
It's Sir Karell.

399
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:25,641
- Are you sure? Are you sure it's Sir Karell?
- Yes.

400
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:45,729
The night will soon be spent
and nothing accomplished.

401
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,826
Well, are we going to sit here and think,
or are we going to do something?

402
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:52,270
Incredible. Incredible.

403
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,877
If Sir Karell...

404
00:34:00,948 --> 00:34:04,349
I still maintain Miss Borotyn's
the only one who can influence her father.

405
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:06,944
- Are you mad?
- Good heavens, no.

406
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:11,117
Can't you understand?
She mustn't even know her father's there.

407
00:34:11,192 --> 00:34:12,216
Of course not.

408
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:15,023
- Vampires or no vampires, I'm going to...
- What are you going to do?

409
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:18,532
- Call headquarters for help.
- Yes, surround the place, set fire to it.

410
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,263
Fire, an army of police,
a hurricane of bullets

411
00:34:23,337 --> 00:34:25,066
would do no good.

412
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:29,269
You seem to forget
that during the hours of darkness

413
00:34:29,343 --> 00:34:32,278
the vampire can't even be harmed,

414
00:34:32,346 --> 00:34:34,246
let alone destroyed.

415
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,606
If they can't be destroyed,
then we're wasting time.

416
00:34:36,684 --> 00:34:40,450
I didn't say they couldn't be destroyed.
They can.

417
00:34:40,888 --> 00:34:43,982
By day the vampires must return

418
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:46,526
to the ground in which they were buried

419
00:34:46,594 --> 00:34:50,587
or else find shelter
in some accursed retreat.

420
00:34:50,665 --> 00:34:53,225
It is then they are powerless.

421
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:56,793
Then we must leave at daybreak.
It's our chance to get away from here.

422
00:34:56,871 --> 00:34:57,963
What?

423
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:01,805
And leave these monsters here
to continue their work of destruction?

424
00:35:01,876 --> 00:35:05,004
- It would be cowardice.
- What else is there to do?

425
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:09,106
Search for them.
Find their corpse-like bodies.

426
00:35:09,183 --> 00:35:12,380
It is in that state and that state only

427
00:35:12,453 --> 00:35:14,318
they can be destroyed.

428
00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:19,185
Their heads must be severed
with one clean stroke

429
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,993
and a sprig of bat thorn
placed within the gaping wound.

430
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,656
We would be crazy to attempt
what you're planning.

431
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:30,397
I'll never do it, never.
In the morning, we're leaving.

432
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:31,904
I agree with you.

433
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:34,635
Yes? Yes.

434
00:35:37,078 --> 00:35:38,204
2:30.

435
00:35:39,247 --> 00:35:41,715
In three hours it will be daylight.

436
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,486
Oh, thank heaven
the house is well protected for the night.

437
00:35:46,988 --> 00:35:50,253
Come, gentlemen,
let's go to bed and get some rest.

438
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,601
I had gone to bed as you said.

439
00:36:42,043 --> 00:36:44,944
I laid here for hours trying to go to sleep.

440
00:36:45,346 --> 00:36:47,610
But I was restless. I couldn't.

441
00:36:48,482 --> 00:36:50,416
Then I heard Maria leave the room.

442
00:36:50,484 --> 00:36:53,544
Why did you leave the room?
You had your orders.

443
00:36:53,621 --> 00:36:56,556
To get some coffee to keep me awake.

444
00:36:56,624 --> 00:36:58,489
You fool.

445
00:36:59,393 --> 00:37:02,726
And after Maria left the room,
then what happened?

446
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:06,162
I heard a sound like wind at the casement.

447
00:37:07,068 --> 00:37:08,535
I felt a draft.

448
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:12,971
Then I saw her,
just as she was on the terrace.

449
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:17,134
I fought to keep my eyes open,
but they closed.

450
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:21,373
I felt again that deadly, cold breath.

451
00:37:22,316 --> 00:37:26,377
The horror of it made me feel faint.

452
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:29,620
There, there, my child.

453
00:37:43,604 --> 00:37:46,732
That young man, go to him. Hurry.

454
00:37:50,444 --> 00:37:52,776
That cross I told you to wear...

455
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:56,874
Maid, get it immediately.
Put it about her neck.

456
00:37:57,718 --> 00:38:01,484
- Wake up. Come on.
- Go away. What? What's the matter?

457
00:38:01,555 --> 00:38:04,683
- What's wrong?
- Fedor, are you... Are you all right?

458
00:38:05,593 --> 00:38:08,585
Something's wrong.
Irena, what's happened to her?

459
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:10,995
Mr. Vincenté, quiet, please.

460
00:38:11,065 --> 00:38:13,124
Fedor, Irena, she's been...

461
00:38:15,436 --> 00:38:17,768
Miss Borotyn is asleep.

462
00:38:18,306 --> 00:38:21,707
Quick, Inspector, close that door, please.

463
00:38:21,776 --> 00:38:23,539
Why are you here?

464
00:38:23,611 --> 00:38:28,139
We've been watching through the night,
but now the dawn is here.

465
00:38:28,215 --> 00:38:32,481
We wanted to be sure
that you were safe before we retired.

466
00:38:32,553 --> 00:38:36,853
I felt drowsy.
I must have fallen sound asleep.

467
00:38:36,924 --> 00:38:39,688
Sound? You were in a stupor.
We had to shake you.

468
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,954
Stupor?

469
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:45,993
Tell me,

470
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:51,028
this deep sleep, did it refresh you?

471
00:38:51,272 --> 00:38:53,240
Why, yes. Why do you ask?

472
00:38:54,942 --> 00:38:56,500
What are you doing?

473
00:38:56,577 --> 00:38:59,978
I just wanted to look
at the wounds on your neck.

474
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:18,998
That deep sleep was unnatural.

475
00:39:19,433 --> 00:39:21,594
Fortunately, he wasn't harmed.

476
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:25,004
When the maid screamed out to us,

477
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:27,905
it must have frightened the monster away.

478
00:39:29,143 --> 00:39:32,772
Gentlemen, we must face the truth,

479
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:35,247
the horrible truth.

480
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,414
Miss Borotyn is in their power.

481
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:43,181
To save her we must break the spell.

482
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:48,287
If we don't succeed in destroying
those monsters by sundown,

483
00:39:48,362 --> 00:39:49,989
we may be too late.

484
00:39:50,064 --> 00:39:52,897
- Quick, get into your clothes.
- Come, Baron.

485
00:40:14,655 --> 00:40:15,917
Professor.

486
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:21,451
Professor Zelin.

487
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:23,824
In here, Inspector.

488
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:28,466
- Have you searched thoroughly above?
- Yes.

489
00:40:28,536 --> 00:40:30,902
Not so much as a mark
on the dust-covered floor.

490
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:35,169
Same over there at the organ
where you saw Sir Karell playing.

491
00:40:35,676 --> 00:40:38,907
The dust lies thick and undisturbed.

492
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:43,678
That's what makes it so difficult
to find the vampire's hiding place.

493
00:40:43,751 --> 00:40:46,481
Well, don't let's stand here talking.
Let's go on looking for them.

494
00:40:46,554 --> 00:40:49,114
You're quite right, Inspector.
Have you some matches?

495
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,214
Yes.

496
00:40:50,758 --> 00:40:51,918
Oh, look.

497
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:55,689
No, no, no, no, no. Up there on the rod.

498
00:41:01,202 --> 00:41:02,669
Stop, you fool.

499
00:41:02,736 --> 00:41:05,569
Would you destroy
what might give us a clue?

500
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:06,867
Smash it. Take no chances.

501
00:41:06,941 --> 00:41:09,739
No, no, no. That would do no good.

502
00:41:10,044 --> 00:41:13,673
It's only in its own corpse-like state

503
00:41:13,747 --> 00:41:15,942
that it can be destroyed.

504
00:41:16,717 --> 00:41:19,914
Now, we must search the vaults

505
00:41:19,987 --> 00:41:22,012
beneath the old ruins.

506
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,850
Come, we have not much time left
before sunset.

507
00:41:27,928 --> 00:41:30,226
- You have matches, Inspector?
- Yes, Professor.

508
00:41:30,297 --> 00:41:31,389
Yes.

509
00:42:46,574 --> 00:42:49,008
Professor Zelin, are you all right?

510
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:08,920
- Professor. Professor Zelin.
- Here. Please, hurry.

511
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:21,403
Quick, Inspector, get the candle.
We must find the others.

512
00:43:21,742 --> 00:43:25,041
No, no. Don't leave. Destroy him first.

513
00:43:27,948 --> 00:43:30,178
Stop him!

514
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:33,619
Have you gone mad?

515
00:43:33,687 --> 00:43:36,281
One more stupid act and we'll be lost.

516
00:43:36,357 --> 00:43:38,723
Please, please don't leave him like this.

517
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:42,228
And expose ourselves to the vengeance
of the others?

518
00:43:42,396 --> 00:43:45,923
Why, their fury would follow us
to the ends of the earth.

519
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:51,370
No, we must destroy them all together.
Come.

520
00:44:01,982 --> 00:44:06,442
Inspector, put a mark on that door
so we'll know his hiding place.

521
00:44:13,627 --> 00:44:15,822
- Quick, matches.
- Wait, please.

522
00:44:19,867 --> 00:44:23,325
We'll be trapped in here. Hurry.
The sun is going down.

523
00:44:34,248 --> 00:44:37,877
I'm staying here until you come with me.
I won't leave you.

524
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:41,283
Fedor, you must go.

525
00:44:42,189 --> 00:44:44,987
If you love me, please do as I ask.

526
00:44:52,366 --> 00:44:53,697
Inspector.

527
00:44:58,806 --> 00:45:00,034
Inspector.

528
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:03,036
The fool.

529
00:45:28,402 --> 00:45:31,098
Fedor, we're being silly.

530
00:45:33,373 --> 00:45:37,104
Don't let's argue, darling.
We'll just forget all about it.

531
00:45:37,678 --> 00:45:39,942
Now, you run along downstairs.

532
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:43,880
I want to get out of this negligee.
I haven't had a dress on for ages.

533
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:47,853
- Irena, I don't understand you.
- You silly boy, what's wrong?

534
00:45:48,388 --> 00:45:51,255
Last night you were terrified
and tonight you're...

535
00:45:51,325 --> 00:45:54,954
- You're gay and cheerful.
- Are you sorry because I'm happy?

536
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:57,195
Yes? Come in.

537
00:45:58,766 --> 00:46:01,599
Those doors. Those doors.
They shouldn't be open.

538
00:46:01,668 --> 00:46:04,432
They should be closed. The bat thorn.

539
00:46:08,075 --> 00:46:10,373
Oh, Miss, you know
the Professor said that you shouldn't...

540
00:46:10,444 --> 00:46:11,934
Go away, Maria. Leave us alone.

541
00:46:12,012 --> 00:46:13,707
It's all right, Maria. You can go.
I'm with her.

542
00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:16,181
- Oh, mister. But, mister...
- No, run along. Just run along, okay?

543
00:46:17,551 --> 00:46:20,987
What's the matter with everyone,
worrying about a silly weed?

544
00:46:21,054 --> 00:46:23,579
Irena, I've got to know
why you're acting like this.

545
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:25,818
What are you hiding from me?

546
00:46:26,226 --> 00:46:29,491
- Don't ask me, please.
- But I have a right to know.

547
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,861
There's something wrong with you.
You're not yourself.

548
00:46:32,933 --> 00:46:36,130
Irena, look at me.

549
00:46:42,142 --> 00:46:45,043
Irena, I feel that I'm losing you.

550
00:46:45,546 --> 00:46:49,778
Fedor, forgive me.
Forgive me for what I am doing.

551
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:54,252
- Darling, tell me. Tell me.
- Fedor, I...

552
00:46:55,489 --> 00:46:57,957
- No, no, no, no.
- Irena.

553
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,991
Irena! Irena!

554
00:47:08,235 --> 00:47:09,896
Inspector Neumann.

555
00:47:15,943 --> 00:47:17,604
Inspector Neumann.

556
00:47:40,667 --> 00:47:42,464
Be brave, my child.

557
00:47:44,938 --> 00:47:46,132
I'll try.

558
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:50,240
Then go with Luna.

559
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:12,462
No, no. Don't go up.

560
00:48:14,401 --> 00:48:16,164
But don't you see?

561
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,961
If Sir Karell was in life

562
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:22,736
the kindly, benevolent person
you describe,

563
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:25,710
your lifelong and devoted friend,

564
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:29,074
you could go to him.
You could appeal to him.

565
00:48:29,149 --> 00:48:31,549
No, no. I can't.

566
00:48:53,907 --> 00:48:56,842
Go away, Fedor! Go away! Go away!

567
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:58,468
Irena. Irena!

568
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:05,509
Everything is getting cloudy.

569
00:49:06,853 --> 00:49:08,878
Getting cloudy.

570
00:49:09,957 --> 00:49:11,754
You understand?

571
00:49:12,693 --> 00:49:14,752
Getting cloudy.

572
00:49:16,296 --> 00:49:18,924
You're going upstairs.

573
00:49:19,466 --> 00:49:21,559
You understand?

574
00:49:22,903 --> 00:49:26,270
You're going upstairs.

575
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:54,032
- No, no. I can't do it.
- But, Miss Borotyn.

576
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:56,092
I can't go on.

577
00:49:56,169 --> 00:49:58,069
But you must. You wouldn't fail us now.

578
00:49:58,138 --> 00:50:00,129
- Miss Borotyn.
- Inspector.

579
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:03,301
Inspector Neumann,
I can't go through with it.

580
00:50:03,377 --> 00:50:06,403
He looks so much like Father,
even his voice.

581
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:11,349
I've been willing to do all the other things
you've asked of me, but this...

582
00:50:11,418 --> 00:50:13,215
This is more than I can endure.

583
00:50:13,286 --> 00:50:17,382
But don't you see this is our last chance?
Everything else has failed.

584
00:50:17,457 --> 00:50:19,584
But you both said Baron Otto
would break down and confess

585
00:50:19,659 --> 00:50:23,186
if we confronted him with this gentleman
pretending to be my father.

586
00:50:23,263 --> 00:50:26,323
I know, we all thought
our vampire scheme was so simple,

587
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,563
so certain of success.
We never thought we'd fail.

588
00:50:29,636 --> 00:50:30,967
I'm sorry.

589
00:50:31,938 --> 00:50:33,565
But, Miss Borotyn,

590
00:50:34,841 --> 00:50:36,536
after the attack on Mr. Vincenté,

591
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:39,044
it was you who first suspected the Baron
of the crime.

592
00:50:39,112 --> 00:50:41,410
We are positive you are right,
but we lack definite proof.

593
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:44,507
If you fail us now, we will never know.

594
00:50:45,218 --> 00:50:49,746
But to live through those moments again,
to act as if you were my father,

595
00:50:49,956 --> 00:50:54,620
alive and with me...
Don't you see the horror of it?

596
00:51:07,074 --> 00:51:10,237
It's one year ago.

597
00:51:11,845 --> 00:51:16,373
One year ago. You understand?

598
00:51:17,384 --> 00:51:20,080
One year ago.

599
00:51:21,555 --> 00:51:24,922
You're going to see Sir Karell.

600
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:26,983
You understand?

601
00:51:27,928 --> 00:51:31,523
You're going to see Sir Karell.

602
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:51,082
Miss Borotyn, get ready.

603
00:51:51,151 --> 00:51:53,881
Baron Otto will be here any moment.

604
00:51:53,954 --> 00:51:55,922
I'm afraid you can't count on me.

605
00:51:55,989 --> 00:52:00,949
Oh, no, no, no, my dear child,
you must be courageous.

606
00:52:01,027 --> 00:52:04,588
I admit what we're trying to do
is only an experiment,

607
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:08,930
but I feel certain,
now that we have the Baron hypnotized,

608
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:11,869
he will reenact his crime if he's guilty.

609
00:52:11,938 --> 00:52:14,133
Baron Otto is at the door, sir.

610
00:52:17,344 --> 00:52:21,212
Oh, please. Without you, we're helpless.

611
00:52:22,716 --> 00:52:24,240
I'll do my best.

612
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:28,518
Inspector.

613
00:52:30,123 --> 00:52:31,215
Jan,

614
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:34,089
I want you to do exactly as you did
the night of the murder.

615
00:52:34,161 --> 00:52:35,389
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

616
00:52:35,462 --> 00:52:36,520
- Omit nothing.
- No, sir.

617
00:52:36,596 --> 00:52:37,961
Let him in.

618
00:52:42,702 --> 00:52:45,000
- Good evening, Jan.
- Good evening, Baron.

619
00:52:45,071 --> 00:52:47,266
- How's your rheumatism?
- It's gone, sir.

620
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,867
- Thanks to the fine weather we're having.
- That's good.

621
00:52:55,282 --> 00:52:59,013
Now, we'll soon know
if my theory is correct.

622
00:52:59,085 --> 00:53:00,416
I hope you're right.

623
00:53:00,487 --> 00:53:02,717
I'm anxious to know
how he drained that body of its blood.

624
00:53:02,789 --> 00:53:03,813
Yes.

625
00:53:04,491 --> 00:53:07,927
- Irena, I've never seen you more lovely.
- Oh, thank you, dear Baron.

626
00:53:07,994 --> 00:53:11,794
- No, Karell, I'm only staying a moment.
- It will do me good to stop for a smoke.

627
00:53:11,865 --> 00:53:14,095
Speaking of smoke, that reminds me,

628
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:17,102
those pipes I ordered from London
have come.

629
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:20,805
Yes, they came this afternoon
and they are beautiful.

630
00:53:20,874 --> 00:53:22,364
- Well...
- Now,

631
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:27,203
- any three of them are yours.
- Three? I'll be satisfied with one.

632
00:53:28,348 --> 00:53:30,373
Now that's like the one you gave me
two years ago.

633
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,384
- Now, Father, don't work too late.
- No, no.

634
00:53:32,452 --> 00:53:34,420
- And don't forget your medicine.
- I won't.

635
00:53:34,487 --> 00:53:37,183
- She knows you, Karell.
- I know you both.

636
00:53:41,127 --> 00:53:44,119
- Good night, Father.
- Good night.

637
00:53:44,898 --> 00:53:46,263
- Good night, Baron.
- Good night, Irena.

638
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:48,460
Put it here on the desk, Jan.

639
00:53:49,736 --> 00:53:52,864
Jan, three drops of this in a glass of water.

640
00:53:52,973 --> 00:53:55,271
- Yes, sir.
- Now, what about the third one?

641
00:54:03,883 --> 00:54:05,612
There, there, there.

642
00:54:09,689 --> 00:54:12,180
- Now...
- Karell,

643
00:54:12,926 --> 00:54:16,020
I was surprised when Irena told me
this afternoon.

644
00:54:16,162 --> 00:54:19,325
I thought you weren't going to consent
to her marriage to that boy.

645
00:54:19,399 --> 00:54:22,300
Well, now, if I weren't here,
you'd be her guardian.

646
00:54:22,369 --> 00:54:23,927
What would you have done?

647
00:54:24,004 --> 00:54:27,565
I would have said no.
I never would have given my consent.

648
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:31,137
I've always hoped that we had other plans.

649
00:54:31,211 --> 00:54:34,772
What do you mean, other plans?

650
00:54:35,715 --> 00:54:36,875
Well,

651
00:54:38,151 --> 00:54:41,382
that she would marry someone
more worthy of her,

652
00:54:41,454 --> 00:54:44,048
someone nearer her station in life,

653
00:54:44,124 --> 00:54:46,092
who could give her
what she's accustomed to.

654
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:49,151
Why, you know she'll always have
more than enough.

655
00:54:49,229 --> 00:54:51,390
Haven't I arranged for that?

656
00:54:56,403 --> 00:54:59,338
- How soon is the wedding?
- Within a fortnight.

657
00:55:00,507 --> 00:55:01,906
A fortnight?

658
00:55:04,978 --> 00:55:08,243
Karell, will you let me have
Irena's ruby necklace?

659
00:55:08,415 --> 00:55:11,578
There may be time to have
bracelet and earrings made to match.

660
00:55:11,651 --> 00:55:14,643
And you would have said no?

661
00:55:14,721 --> 00:55:18,748
Why, you've spoiled her
since the day she was born.

662
00:55:20,894 --> 00:55:22,555
Jan, help me here.

663
00:55:41,581 --> 00:55:44,243
Now, where did I put that necklace?

664
00:55:47,253 --> 00:55:50,188
- There it is, my good friend.
- Thanks, Karell.

665
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:52,290
I've been keeping you from your work
long enough.

666
00:55:52,359 --> 00:55:54,020
- No, no. I'm glad you came over.
- Good night.

667
00:55:54,094 --> 00:55:55,186
Good night.

668
00:56:01,634 --> 00:56:04,034
- Good night, Jan.
- Good night, sir.

669
00:56:05,872 --> 00:56:09,069
Quick. Get through one of those rooms
and watch the window on the terrace.

670
00:56:09,142 --> 00:56:10,234
Yes.

671
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:11,334
Well?

672
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:15,711
- He thinks he's drugged your wine.
- I know. I saw him. Jan, come here.

673
00:56:16,616 --> 00:56:20,484
Tell me, did Sir Karell drink the wine
before he dismissed you?

674
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,082
No. No, sir.

675
00:56:22,155 --> 00:56:23,554
- You're positive?
- Quite.

676
00:56:23,623 --> 00:56:26,490
Drink it, collapse,
and then we'll see what happens.

677
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:27,821
All right.

678
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:37,764
- Put these pipes in my room, Jan.
- Yes, sir.

679
00:56:38,204 --> 00:56:40,195
I don't think I'll be wanting
anything more tonight.

680
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:43,208
- Very good, sir. Good night, sir.
- Good night.

681
00:58:22,442 --> 00:58:24,740
Stop! Don't move, Baron!

682
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:31,112
Look at me. Look me in the eye, Baron.

683
00:58:31,885 --> 00:58:33,147
That's it.

684
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:37,046
Everything is getting cloudy.

685
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:40,152
Cloudy.

686
00:58:41,461 --> 00:58:42,951
You understand?

687
00:58:45,098 --> 00:58:46,861
You are returning,

688
00:58:48,201 --> 00:58:52,831
returning to the present. You understand?

689
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:58,907
You are returning to the present.

690
00:59:09,689 --> 00:59:10,815
Baron.

691
00:59:12,191 --> 00:59:13,453
Baron Otto,

692
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:17,689
you're under arrest for the murder
of Sir Karell Borotyn.

693
00:59:19,365 --> 00:59:23,597
You were very clever in concealing
the motive of your crime.

694
00:59:24,537 --> 00:59:27,973
We never dreamt it was Miss Borotyn
you were after.

695
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:31,173
Franz, take him out to the car.

696
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:39,141
I don't get the idea
of his heating the glass.

697
00:59:39,218 --> 00:59:43,052
Only to cup him with,
to cup him of his blood.

698
00:59:43,556 --> 00:59:47,925
That hot glass over the wound
creates a powerful suction.

699
00:59:49,062 --> 00:59:50,620
Forgive me, Fedor,

700
00:59:50,697 --> 00:59:52,631
but they wouldn't let me tell you.

701
00:59:52,699 --> 00:59:55,065
They were afraid that you wouldn't let me
go through with it.

702
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:01,402
This vampire business,
it has given me a great idea for a new act.

703
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:06,569
Luna, in the new act I will be the vampire.

704
01:00:07,547 --> 01:00:10,744
Did you watch me? I gave all of me.

705
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:14,347
I was greater than any real vampire.

706
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,945
Sure, sure, but get off your makeup.

707
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:19,787
Yes, and help me
with some of this packing.
