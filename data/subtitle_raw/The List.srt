1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,727
Take Mr. Candler's horse
and lead it in the back.

3
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,922
Thank you. Go on in.

4
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,938
Are you with us then?

5
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,628
I, the Lord, my God...

6
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,214
am a jealous God...

7
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,341
visiting the iniquities...

8
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,553
of the fathers upon the children...

9
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,305
unto the third
and the fourth generations...

10
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,725
and showing mercy-

11
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,568
This is the final-

12
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,131
Hear!

13
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,205
Jefferson McClintock on line one.

14
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:11,418
Please, Bonny, no more calls.
I'm late enough as it is.

15
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,964
- Did you say "McClintock"?
- Yes.

16
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,842
Put him through.

17
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,846
Mr. McClintock. Renny Jacobson.

18
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,349
Yes, sir, it has been a long time.
What can I do for you?

19
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,936
Okay.

20
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,944
Yes, sir. I understand.

21
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,614
Yes, sir.

22
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,577
Right.

23
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,620
I appreciate you calling.

24
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,622
Thank you.

25
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,719
Sir.

26
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,481
Tell Mr. Barnette-

27
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,275
Tell Mr. Barnette there's nothing
I can do about the signatures...

28
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,486
on the South End
merger documents.

29
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,405
Seems I gotta go to Charleston
to bury my father.

30
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,407
Oh, I'm sorry.

31
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:41,633
I have high hopes for Mr. Jacobson.
Very high hopes.

32
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:47,681
#Amazing #

33
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,810
#Grace #

34
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:56,856
# How sweet #

35
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:01,152
#The sound #

36
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:05,365
#That saved #

37
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:09,035
#A wretch #

38
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:15,709
#Like me #

39
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,254
#I once #

40
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,298
# Was lost #

41
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:27,053
#But now #

42
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:31,474
#I am found #

43
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,894
#So blind ##

44
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,287
I wanna miss him, Mama A.

45
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,414
I know, son.

46
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:00,837
He was just so different
after your mama died- harder.

47
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,340
All I ever knew was hard.

48
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,804
Well, you know...

49
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,265
he told me, right before he died...

50
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,602
that he knew he might have
been too hard on you.

51
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,606
I guess he never told you.

52
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,113
Come on, honey.

53
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,115
Oh.

54
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,594
There we are in the quad at The Citadel.

55
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,638
Can you find your father?

56
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,684
Yup.

57
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,686
Shall we?

58
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,025
- Uh, have a seat.
- I brought my copy.

59
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:07,153
Even with the size of the estate,
it shouldn't be too complicated.

60
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,323
He left everything to me.

61
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,743
Renny, uh, what do you remember
about holographic wills?

62
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:20,208
They're handwritten,
without the legal boilerplate.

63
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,503
Uh, usually no witnesses.
Why?

64
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,840
Well, your, uh,
father added this to his file.

65
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:31,094
It's dated one month
after the will you have.

66
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,347
We just found it.

67
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,851
- How do we know this is authentic?
- He anticipated that.

68
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:42,188
This from a local psychiatrist attesting
to his mental competency.

69
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,733
Handwriting analysis.

70
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,821
It's a match.

71
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,199
"A II my residual estate...

72
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,744
"in equal shares to The Citadel...

73
00:08:55,827 --> 00:09:00,749
Charleston Historical Society
and the Episcopal Parish of St. Albans."

74
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,751
Whoa.

75
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,798
He left me nothin'?

76
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,638
- Well, we can just tear it up.
- Renny, you're a lawyer.
You know better than that.

77
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:19,059
St. Albans Parish?
I mean, he wasn't even religious.

78
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,145
- Yeah, maybe that was the guilt speaking.
- Oh, please!

79
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,231
He's paying his way into heaven!

80
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:29,110
Well, he did say that you
were to receive his, uh...

81
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,363
gold coin collection and, uh-

82
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,656
"The right, title and interest...

83
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,534
"to any and all assets,
tangible and intangible...

84
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,746
to my share of the Covenant List
of South Carolina, Limited."

85
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,667
We went through the inventory of assets
and didn't find any record of this company.

86
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,421
- You know what it is?
- He never told me anything,
Mr. McClintock. Obviously.

87
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,841
Well, he, uh...

88
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,761
did leave you this key
to a safe-deposit box.

89
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,264
Number 413 at Planters
and Merchants Bank.

90
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,810
Oh, and one other thing here.

91
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:05,522
Do, uh- Do you recognize
any of these names?

92
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,529
"Desmond Larochette,
Bart Maxwell...

93
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,157
Thomas Layne IV,
Taylor Johnston. "

94
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,622
Families with long histories
in the low country.

95
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,959
No personal connections?

96
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,044
No, none that I know of.
Why?

97
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:33,008
Well, he left instructions that his obituary
was to be sent to these people.

98
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,804
- Well, any responses?
- No.

99
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:44,644
Was there anything else, or...
should I not even bother to ask?

100
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:48,064
Fortunately not.

101
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,026
I'll delay the sale of the house
for a few weeks...

102
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,029
so you can take out
anything you want to.

103
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,158
What about, uh-

104
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,327
What about the first edition
of To Kill a Mockingbird?

105
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,206
Well, you keep it.

106
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,792
And his boat, the Jacobson IV?

107
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,545
Oh, sorry.
That's a titled asset.

108
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,341
Tell me.

109
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,261
What was he worth?

110
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,182
How much did he not leave me?

111
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,521
Well, depending on the value of the securities
at the time of probate...

112
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,694
it was more than $22 million.

113
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,163
#Everybody everywhere #

114
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:49,209
#Is happy #

115
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,009
#Leads them up the garden path #

116
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:01,930
#So easily #

117
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:09,312
#Don't close your eyes #

118
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:20,448
#Don't look so surprised #

119
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:28,748
# You had to swallow every lie ##

120
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,105
Also, uh...

121
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,525
contact Mr. Thompson
at New Dominion.

122
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,486
Get a meetin' lined up sometime
in the next week to discuss escrow.

123
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,740
Remind him that Pat Jenkins
promised us prime plus one.

124
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,742
If he doesn't-

125
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,869
"1863."

126
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,420
What's this?

127
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:49,806
I expect the terms of my will
may have come as a shock.

128
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,144
My father's will contained
those same provisions.

129
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,063
Don't worry.

130
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,816
Your true wealth lies
in the Covenant List of South Carolina...

131
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,819
or, as we call it, "The List."

132
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,363
If anyone else is
in the room with you...

133
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,533
please ask them to leave.

134
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,953
The gold coin has been passed down
from father to son...

135
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,997
for 140 years...

136
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,833
as a symbol of the true source
of financial stability...

137
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,918
for our family.

138
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,922
Toward the end of the war, most planters
and landowners faced the loss...

139
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,300
of everything
their families had built.

140
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:29,346
Our family, together with
10 other plantation owners...

141
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,265
entered into an agreement,
a covenant, if you will.

142
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,809
This group smuggled gold
out of the Confederacy...

143
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:38,438
to safe havens
throughout the world.

144
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,983
Funds now flow
through Swiss banks.

145
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:46,029
For many years, I've had the honor
and privilege of being the keeper of the List.

146
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,658
On the wall next to my desk...

147
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,952
there is a compartment.

148
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:56,873
In the top left drawer rests a key.

149
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,960
That key opens the compartment
which contains the List.

150
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,672
By now there should be
a letter on my desk...

151
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:07,926
notifying you of the meeting that will begin
your initiation process.

152
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,143
Do not discuss this with anyone.

153
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,438
Most importantly...

154
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:24,025
there has not always been
unity among the members.

155
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,027
Be careful.

156
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,322
Preservation of the List is everything.
Carpe diem.

157
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,826
Rice Planter's Inn, this weekend.

158
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,953
Listen to me.
Listen to me!

159
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,664
I am holding in my hand,
as we speak...

160
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:41,710
a letter from your bank giving me
full ownership of this account.

161
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:45,672
Now you're telling me that without
this Desmond Larochette's signature...

162
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:49,926
I can't get access
to my money? Really?

163
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,470
Listen here.
I'm goin' out of town this weekend.

164
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,348
Come Monday,
you better have my money.

165
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,360
No. Not again.

166
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,085
Hi.

167
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:29,132
Thanks.

168
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:34,054
Can I help?

169
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,389
No. Thank you.

170
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,934
- Haven't I seen you before?
- Honestly, right now is really not the time.

171
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,437
You were at St. Albans
Cemetery, right?

172
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,900
I was burying my father.

173
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,528
So was I.

174
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,993
- How did you remember me?
- You were crying.

175
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,995
I wasn't.

176
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,332
One of y'all need a tow?

177
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,334
Yeah. I do. Hi.

178
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,588
Uh, shop's right around the corner, baby.
You wanna ride over with me and Harold?

179
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,340
I can give you a lift.

180
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:15,679
Or at least allow me to wait with you,
make sure everything's okay.

181
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,098
Really, it's okay.
I think I'll just chance it with Harold.

182
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:21,351
How 'bout, uh, I buy you lunch?

183
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:25,188
Hey, uh-
Y'all can call my cell, right?

184
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,732
- Yeah.
- How's that barbecue over there?

185
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:31,528
The best pig in the county. Tell 'em I sent you,
they'll give you extra hush puppies.

186
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:35,573
- Best pig in the whole county.
- Sugar, you sure you don't want a ride?

187
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,702
We'll be in plain view
the whole way.

188
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,539
Promise.

189
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,710
Renny Jacobson.

190
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,171
Jo Johnston.

191
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,550
Pleased to meet you, Jo.

192
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,970
#And you shiver when the cold-#

193
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,566
I always thank God for barbecue.

194
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,360
At this place,
you pray after you eat.

195
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:18,908
- Some more tea?
- Yeah. Please.

196
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,871
Mmm. Thank you.

197
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:28,168
- What was your father's name?
- Taylor.

198
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:31,004
Taylor Johnston.

199
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:34,215
Harold.

200
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,677
Ooh. Thanks. Hello.

201
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,391
Mm-hmm.

202
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,562
Okay. Yeah.

203
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:54,736
Thank you. Yeah. Okay. Bye.

204
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:01,743
Unbelievable. I'm not going to know
anything until tomorrow.

205
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:06,289
Jo, are you going to
the Rice Planter's Inn?

206
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,542
Jo Taylor Johnston?

207
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,088
Yeah.

208
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:17,842
Josiah Fletchall Jacobson.

209
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,312
Let's make some arrangements.

210
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,857
I can bring you back
for your truck.

211
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,995
- Have you tried to get your money?
- Money?

212
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,084
What money?

213
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:54,087
What did your father tell you?

214
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,923
Nothing.
He left when I was a baby.

215
00:20:57,007 --> 00:21:00,343
I got a letter and that truck,
and you can see how that turned out.

216
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,345
Well...

217
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:06,808
figure over 140 years'
compound interest.

218
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,436
Is this legitimate?

219
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,188
I'm a lawyer,
and I'm keepin' an open mind.

220
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,190
Hmm.

221
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:20,447
I just came here to find out
more about my father.

222
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:23,283
I know too much about my father.

223
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:45,263
Which one doesn't belong?
Wow.

224
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,640
My mom's always been the volunteer.

225
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:51,019
She used to volunteer at the library,
and she also volunteered at the hospital...

226
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:54,022
so that kind of got me interested in medicine,
but I don't know.

227
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,901
School's really expensive, so right now
I'm just taking the semester off...

228
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,153
from nursing school
at Wake Forest.

229
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,490
Hmm. How do you like
the South as opposed to Michigan?

230
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,910
Um, well, when it's like this,
I like it a lot.

231
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,788
You know, it's nice
not having as much snow.

232
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:14,167
The people are friendlier,
at least when you first meet them.

233
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,711
What about you?

234
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:19,339
Me? Well, uh-

235
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:22,509
For me the South is many things.

236
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:27,180
It's, uh, live oaks
with long memories...

237
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:30,225
like the ones we passed
coming in here.

238
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:33,103
Azaleas in April.

239
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:37,649
Novels, for sure, by Faulkner, Percy.

240
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:40,527
Characters so real,
they remind me of my neighbors.

241
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:45,699
The sun rising over
the Ashley River...

242
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,909
with the mist
comin' off the water.

243
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:53,373
- And barbecue.
- Definitely the barbecue.

244
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,583
Wow.

245
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,294
Impressive, huh?

246
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:01,256
- You ready for this, Jo?
- I guess.

247
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,221
Good afternoon.

248
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:12,475
Your father's room, Mr. Jacobson.

249
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,396
Second floor,
turn right, third door on your left.

250
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:19,357
And your father's room
is across the hall.

251
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:21,609
The meeting is in there.

252
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,653
7:00.

253
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,655
Thank you.

254
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,627
Are you ready?

255
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:54,017
A woman!

256
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:01,107
Well, we can see that, Gus.

257
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:04,152
You must be Josiah.
You have your father's eyes.

258
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:07,739
- Desmond Larochette.
- People call me Renny.

259
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:11,159
I bet they do.
And you are?

260
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:14,204
Jo Taylor Johnston.

261
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:17,665
Jo. Ah.
Without an "E," I presume.

262
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:21,419
Mmm. Very nice to meet you.

263
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:24,047
Uh-Well, gentlemen, please...

264
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,132
introduce yourself to our guests.

265
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,635
Mr. Jacobson, Miss Johnston.

266
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:31,304
Bart Maxwell.

267
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:34,140
- Bart Maxwell.
- Renny Jacobson. Nice to meet you.

268
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:36,142
- Thomas Layne.
- Michael Flournoy.

269
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,228
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.

270
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,480
- Hey. I'm Gus Eicholtz.
- Hey. Renny Jacobson.

271
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:43,358
Can I get y'all a drink?
Rather, two drinks.

272
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:46,820
- Um, soda water, with lime, please.
- Yes, ma'am. You, sir?

273
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:49,030
- Chivas, rocks.
- Comin' up.

274
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:54,703
- Nervous?
- Not since the bar exam.

275
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:59,457
You should've had Gus coach you.
He seems to know the bar very well.

276
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,835
- Here you go.
- Oh. Thank you.

277
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:04,004
- Thank you.
- Who is that?

278
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,341
That's John C. Calhoun...

279
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:10,385
secretary of state under
William Henry Harrison.

280
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:14,180
Enduring symbol of the old South.

281
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:17,934
- Died in 1850.
- He looks mad.

282
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:21,521
Not half as mad as he'd look
if he died in 1865.

283
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:25,942
In these parts, when people talk about "the war,"
they mean the war between the states.

284
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:29,988
Or some of us down here call it
"the war of Northern aggression."

285
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:34,075
Oh, come on now, Harry.

286
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,203
Hurts no one
to let her dine with us.

287
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:40,790
What can you tell me
about my father?

288
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,878
He was a brilliant engineer.

289
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:47,339
Could have designed
the Golden Gate.

290
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:51,051
But every time I talked to him,
he was in a new town.

291
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:55,221
At these things, he'd stay at the bar,
kept mostly to himself-

292
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:58,433
especially about his family.

293
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:01,144
Why would he keep me a secret?

294
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:05,398
Dear heart, do you see
any other women here?

295
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,904
Lady and gentlemen.

296
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:13,656
Would you please
take your places for dinner?

297
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:18,411
We all have assigned seats.
Your family sits right over there, Miss Johnston.

298
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:22,082
- This is your father's chair.
- Thank you.

299
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:26,127
I was, uh, sorry to hear about your father.
Where'd it happen?

300
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:29,798
He'd just double bogeyed number 17
on the links course at Wild Dunes.

301
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:34,177
- That hole almost killed me one time, remember?
- Yeah.

302
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:40,975
Now, I'll give you the real introductions
to these people here.

303
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:44,437
Flournoy wishes he could put "count"
in front of his name.

304
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:47,649
Roget there is Desmond's shadow.

305
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:51,194
Harry nurses his grudge
against Desmond.

306
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:56,241
Seems that Desmond's great-granddaddy
shot Harry's great-granddaddy...

307
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:59,119
in the kneecap with a Derringer.

308
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:03,456
Do you like chateaubriand?

309
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,167
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

310
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:08,712
Weiss-

311
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,131
He's a bean counter from Virginia.

312
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:15,468
He looks tough, but he takes a bodyguard
with him everywhere he goes.

313
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:21,182
And Desmond, well...

314
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:24,310
he's not enjoying this evening.

315
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:27,689
He does not enjoy the controversy...

316
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:30,650
caused by Miss Johnston.

317
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:34,195
And unless he can pull
a Strom Thurmond...

318
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,823
he'll die without an heir.

319
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:38,992
Of course, Thomas here...

320
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,494
is enjoying Miss Johnston.

321
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:44,247
Absolutely.

322
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,499
And poor Bart Maxwell.

323
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:50,253
Getting married in two weeks.
Gonna lose his freedom.

324
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,547
To a Yankee, no less.

325
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,509
Hear. Hear.

326
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:01,723
Miss Johnston,
your presence here tonight...

327
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:04,184
presents us with quite a dilemma.

328
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:06,561
I'm sure you can appreciate that.

329
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:09,356
Now, I've spoken to Harry here...

330
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:12,609
and we believe the issue
should be discussed by all the members...

331
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,861
in your absence.

332
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:17,197
As for Mr. Jacobson...

333
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:20,784
why, I see no reason why he shouldn't
be part of these discussions.

334
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:23,912
Is that fair,
to put him in that position?

335
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:26,206
I have no problem
with him staying.

336
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:30,043
- Well, I do.
-  All right. Let's put it to the vote.

337
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:32,712
I shall abstain.

338
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:35,924
All those in favor of Mr. Jacobson
leaving the room...

339
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:39,010
while Miss Johnston's
status is discussed...

340
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:41,096
please raise your right hand.

341
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:47,185
Harry, Robert, Michael.
Anyone else- Jerrod.

342
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:51,356
That's four to three.
Majority rules.

343
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:04,786
They seem harmless enough.

344
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,871
I'm sure you'll get in.

345
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:09,082
I'm not sure I want in.

346
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,835
- What?
- I don't know, Renny. Come on.

347
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:15,088
It's like secret societies
and blood oaths.

348
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,133
These aren't little kids.
They're grown men. It feels weird.

349
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:21,553
Just play along, Jo.
Think about the money.

350
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,390
Please, rejoin us.

351
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,312
Miss Johnston...

352
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:34,190
your family...

353
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:38,528
has participated in the List
since the very beginning.

354
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:41,990
Uh, nevertheless,
there's something to be said...

355
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:43,992
for tradition.

356
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:46,745
Membership has passed
from father to son...

357
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:49,205
for nearly a century and a half.

358
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:53,960
Now, it's this-
this dedication to tradition...

359
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:56,004
that's been our strength.

360
00:29:56,087 --> 00:30:00,550
The Johnston family participation
in the List...

361
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,385
has come to an end.

362
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:09,184
I'll go...

363
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:11,811
but first I have some questions.

364
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:14,356
I want to know more
about my father.

365
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:18,985
Uh, we don't socialize very much,
Miss Johnston.

366
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:22,030
- It's a business partnership.
- So you don't know anything.

367
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:27,660
My father left me a letter blaming
this group for the way his life turned out.

368
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:31,498
Every old Southern family
has its share of, um, lunatics...

369
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:33,833
in the back parlor...

370
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,586
and illegitimate children
in the shack down the road.

371
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:41,132
That's not quite what I meant,
and I think you know that.

372
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:46,179
- Well, then thank you for dinner, gentlemen.
- Miss Johnston.

373
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:49,891
- We do hope that you will use your discretion.
- Wait a minute.

374
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:53,937
- What about her money?
- Participation in the List is for members only.

375
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,981
Even if she's out,
shouldn't she be paid for the past?

376
00:30:57,065 --> 00:31:00,694
That's her father's responsibility.
That's not ours.

377
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:04,197
Miss Johnston,
you wait here just a minute.

378
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,744
Years ago...

379
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:12,539
your father and I were fishing off
the Florida Keys...

380
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:15,750
and a storm wave
washed me overboard.

381
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:19,337
Your father saved my life.

382
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:24,634
Now, when you think about him...

383
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:29,431
try to remember,
that's the kind of man he was.

384
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:34,352
Thank you. Good night.

385
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:43,778
Gentlemen.

386
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:45,822
I'd like to call to order...

387
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,824
the 247 th meeting...

388
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:51,369
of the Covenant List
of South Carolina, Limited.

389
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:53,413
Now, I- Renny.

390
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,418
Will you please sit down?

391
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,130
Thank you.

392
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:05,633
Now at this time,
I'd like to pause...

393
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,470
in honor of the memory
of Benjamin Hammond...

394
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:10,472
an original signer of the list...

395
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:14,351
who died childless in 1884.

396
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:23,943
Right. Harry here-

397
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:26,196
He's our historian.

398
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:33,495
The Covenant List
of South Carolina, Limited...

399
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:38,124
was established during the war
between the states by our ancestors...

400
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:41,252
to provide for the financial security...

401
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:44,631
of their families and descendants.

402
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:47,384
Now, wherefore...

403
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:52,222
the mutual promises recited herein...

404
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:54,557
are agreed to by the undersigned-

405
00:32:56,267 --> 00:32:59,813
Uh, in-by blood covenant...

406
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:04,317
and bind their descendants...

407
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:07,529
to the rule of primogeniture.

408
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:09,823
Signed Henri Larochette...

409
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:13,535
George P. Smithfield,
Alexander Weiss, Frederick Eicholtz-

410
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:15,870
- Harry. Are you finished?
- Pierre Roget-

411
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:19,165
- Good job. Good job, Harry.
- Marcus J. Johnston-

412
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:21,751
Good. Thank you, Harry.

413
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:24,087
All right, Harry. Thank you.

414
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,923
- Um, right.
- Good job.

415
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:30,885
Uh- Renny, would you mind?

416
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:35,098
- I have some questions too.
- There's no need. You're already in.

417
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:40,020
Would you join me?
It's just a formality.

418
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:48,778
Now...

419
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:50,822
just sign here in the space...

420
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:53,491
underneath your father's name.

421
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:06,379
Now, for millennia...

422
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:09,549
blood has represented life.

423
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:12,886
Now, your life,
along with your forefathers...

424
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:16,556
is joined to us
by an irrevocable bond.

425
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:33,073
Congratulations, son.

426
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:37,077
Welcome.

427
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,995
- Hear! Hear!
- Welcome.

428
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:48,213
Bravo. Bravo.

429
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:55,303
- You're one of us now.
- Gentlemen.

430
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:59,432
I'd like to propose a toast...

431
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:01,935
to Bart.

432
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:04,354
- Hear! Hear!
- Hear! Hear!

433
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:07,107
Thank you, everyone.

434
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,193
Uh, tomorrow we're reenacting
the South's defeat at Fort Anderson.

435
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:13,446
I'm sure you've seen the signs.
Everyone's invited.

436
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:16,783
Thanks. For the record,
I will be wearing gray.

437
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:24,184
- Good morning.
- Hey. Good morning, Renny.

438
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:28,313
Uh, Renny.
We need to talk.

439
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:31,358
Okay.

440
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:35,904
Not here.
At the Jamboree later today.

441
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:42,077
Good.

442
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,412
- So you're gettin' married?
- Yeah. Two weeks.

443
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:47,707
How'd you know she was the one?

444
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:51,711
You'll know.

445
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,299
So, you learn
the secret handshake yet?

446
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:58,426
Somethin' like that.

447
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:03,723
Could you, uh- Could you meet me
out front in a few minutes?

448
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,725
Sure.

449
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:17,570
Good morning, Renny.

450
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:19,948
Good morning.

451
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:22,742
You have not touched
the shrimp and grits.

452
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:26,788
That recipe is
from 82 Queen Street.

453
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:29,082
It is delicious.

454
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:31,126
A woman scorned.

455
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:34,754
I don't think she's the type to-

456
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:37,590
Well, we don't take any chances.

457
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:43,263
Why, look at how
her daddy deceived us.

458
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:45,598
Just make sure
she's headed home...

459
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:49,853
and that she intends on
keeping her mouth shut.

460
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:55,400
Delicious.

461
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:03,700
Okay.

462
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:11,624
- Mr. Larochette.
- Where are you going in such a hurry, huh?

463
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:15,503
Pursuing Miss Johnston?
I'll tell you this.

464
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:18,131
It's a better hobby than any of mine.

465
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:21,718
- Mr. Weiss sort of asked me to-
- Oh, that old goat.

466
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:24,637
Listen, the List has survived
for over 140 years.

467
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,639
She's not a threat.

468
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:30,977
You spend as much time
with her as you want.

469
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:33,646
- Thank you, sir. I intend to.
- Good.

470
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,399
Oh, listen.
We'll be reconvening tonight...

471
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:38,443
discussing a possible disbursement.

472
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:41,321
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.

473
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:44,491
Did you see that Corvette in the lot?

474
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:47,619
- Beautiful, huh?
- Yes, sir.

475
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:51,581
Well, it's yours.
Welcome to the List, son.

476
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:55,835
The title and a little gas money
in the envelope.

477
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:59,255
- Thank you, Mr. Larochette.
- Renny.

478
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:02,884
I know your relationship
with your daddy wasn't the best.

479
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:07,722
- He kind of had his own way.
- Yeah, he did.

480
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:10,975
I know I didn't see eye to eye
with him either.

481
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:15,021
I just want you to know
that I am here for you...

482
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:17,440
whenever you need me.

483
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:19,693
Thank you, sir.
I- I appreciate it.

484
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:22,529
- Now, you drive safely.
- I will. Thank you.

485
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:36,668
Well, looks like you got more
than a secret handshake.

486
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:39,045
Just found out my transmission's
totally shot.

487
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:41,047
Hmm.

488
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:47,303
- Best I can do.
- Thank you.

489
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:50,682
Ah, but wait.
You gave me the wrong set.

490
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:52,767
You wanna go for a ride?

491
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:11,911
My grandfather owned several miles
of beach just north of here.

492
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:15,040
He sold it in the '20s.
Dumb move, huh?

493
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:17,375
How can you own the beach?
Oh, wait.

494
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:20,545
Then again, who needs beachfront property
when you're a member of the List?

495
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:22,547
- Ah. Ha-ha.
- Ha-ha.

496
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,175
So what are you gonna do
with all your money anyway?

497
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:28,094
Get free. Quit the firm.

498
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:31,473
I'm tired of being
lawyer number 104 out of 104...

499
00:40:31,556 --> 00:40:33,558
on that letterhead.

500
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:38,438
Then- I don't know.
I thought I might... write.

501
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:41,983
Write? Hmm.
Any ideas?

502
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:46,363
Somethin' important like, uh,
The Yankees' Guide to Southern Barbecue.

503
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:48,656
I'm almost done with my research.

504
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,658
Oh, okay.

505
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:53,828
Actually, I do have
an idea in mind.

506
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:57,582
I've always been fascinated with the story
about a group of 10,000 Southerners...

507
00:40:57,665 --> 00:41:01,086
who pulled up and moved
to Brazil in 1867.

508
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:04,005
- Really? I never heard that.
- Most people haven't.

509
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:08,385
They, uh-They settled in the jungle
near São Paulo.

510
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:10,428
That's amazing.

511
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:13,515
Uh-And this is a true story?

512
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:16,685
Planted sugarcane.
Their descendants still live there.

513
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:19,562
- Well, what's it called?
- Americana.

514
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:21,773
Hmm.

515
00:41:21,856 --> 00:41:24,234
Well, I think it's a great idea.

516
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:26,986
You should do it,
no matter what happens.

517
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:33,284
Junior year I told my father I was thinkin'
of changin' majors to English.

518
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:35,495
Hmm. What'd he say?

519
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:37,622
- He made it easy for me.
- Uh-huh.

520
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:40,875
Major in pre-law
or go on financial aid.

521
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:45,922
Hmm. Well, I think you
should write it now.

522
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:48,133
In fact, if you don't, I will.

523
00:41:48,216 --> 00:41:50,969
You're not an intellectual
property lawyer, are you?

524
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:53,054
Ooh!

525
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:57,934
- Wow!
- Uh-huh!

526
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:00,186
- May I?
- Yeah.

527
00:42:00,228 --> 00:42:04,357
People comb this beach for years
and never find one like that.

528
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:07,110
- So what's it worth?
- Well, nothing.

529
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:09,738
You can buy one at any beach shop
for two bucks.

530
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:13,199
Finding it yourself
is what makes it valuable.

531
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:16,828
Good answer.
Come on.

532
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:21,916
Was that a heart attack?

533
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:52,489
Fire! Fire!

534
00:42:52,572 --> 00:42:55,784
You see Bart?
He's got the flag.

535
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:57,869
Fire!

536
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:03,333
Up the hill! Up the hill!

537
00:43:39,202 --> 00:43:42,163
Good night, Jo. I'll, uh-
I'll see you in the morning.

538
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:44,749
- Good night.
- Renny.

539
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:49,337
Can I have a word
with you a minute?

540
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,926
The meeting's being postponed
till next weekend.

541
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,804
I presume you want to be present
to discuss the disbursement.

542
00:43:57,887 --> 00:44:00,140
- Yes, sir.
- Well.

543
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:04,352
I just can't believe he's gone.

544
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:08,314
He truly was a sweet, sensitive soul.

545
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:12,694
Please.

546
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,866
My nanny used to read me
Bible stories every mornin'.

547
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:21,619
My favorite was
the one about Joseph.

548
00:44:23,204 --> 00:44:25,999
In a jealous rage,
his brothers threw him into a pit...

549
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:28,043
tried to kill him.

550
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:30,295
But he survived.

551
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:35,258
And years later, when he was
in charge of the whole country...

552
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:37,802
they came and knelt before him...

553
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:41,681
begging for their lives.

554
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:44,517
Yeah. Power.

555
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:49,189
True power is when your enemies
beg down before you.

556
00:44:54,235 --> 00:44:56,821
You must take every opportunity, son.

557
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:58,865
The world is about to be yours.

558
00:44:58,948 --> 00:45:01,701
Bart's gone.

559
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:04,287
I'm glad you're here.

560
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:12,212
Hey!
Keep your voice down!

561
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:15,632
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- Keep your voice down.

562
00:45:15,715 --> 00:45:19,844
Bart Maxwell-
He was with us, me and your dad.

563
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:23,807
- Have you tried to get any of your money yet?
- Yes.

564
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:26,851
- Did you get it?
- No.

565
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:30,563
- What stopped ya?
- Gettin' Mr. Larochette's permission.

566
00:45:30,605 --> 00:45:32,607
Exactly.

567
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:37,070
Do you think he should have power
of veto over what's rightfully ours?

568
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:39,406
I don't know.
I just want my money.

569
00:45:39,447 --> 00:45:41,408
Right.

570
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:43,451
I'll be in touch.

571
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:58,675
- Here.
- Oh. Thanks.

572
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:06,141
Hey, um, could we stop
by the family cemetery on the way out?

573
00:46:06,224 --> 00:46:08,935
I just want to visit
my father's grave again...

574
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:11,146
and I don't know when
I'm gonna be back.

575
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:13,148
Sure.

576
00:46:16,943 --> 00:46:19,529
- I'll meet you back here.
- Take your time.

577
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:10,497
I hope I didn't disturb you.
Beautiful, aren't they?

578
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:13,416
Made in Charleston...

579
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,711
patterned after larger versions
in a cathedral in France.

580
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:19,923
Pretty fancy for a small church.

581
00:47:20,006 --> 00:47:22,676
- They're magnificent.
- Hmm.

582
00:47:22,717 --> 00:47:25,220
- Renny Jacobson.
- Michael Harriston.

583
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:28,181
You the church historian?

584
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:30,517
Uh, some might say so.

585
00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:34,896
You know, you pick up a lot by osmosis
if you stay around long enough.

586
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:38,441
You might remember my mother's family.
The Candlers.

587
00:47:38,525 --> 00:47:40,860
Sure do. Good family.

588
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:48,535
- You been to the plot recently?
- Not since I was a little boy
at my grandfather's funeral.

589
00:47:48,576 --> 00:47:51,788
Well, I can lead you right to it.

590
00:49:04,569 --> 00:49:06,780
"Dead at 33."

591
00:49:25,256 --> 00:49:27,258
Here you are.

592
00:49:29,678 --> 00:49:31,971
"Amos Candler.

593
00:49:32,013 --> 00:49:34,057
Though dead, he speaks."

594
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:37,394
Was he a direct ancestor?

595
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:39,688
Amos Candler?

596
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:45,193
Why, he would have been
your great-great-great grandfather.

597
00:49:46,194 --> 00:49:48,446
First Candler to settle around here.

598
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,828
- Did the church put the flowers on the grave?
- No, I did.

599
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:57,914
Today's the anniversary
of his death.

600
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:04,379
I do a little something each year.

601
00:50:04,462 --> 00:50:08,466
He was as fit for heaven as anyone
who ever set foot in the low country.

602
00:50:17,308 --> 00:50:20,603
Well, I'll leave you alone.

603
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:26,234
No, I'm- I'm done.

604
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,823
You know much
about the Civil War?

605
00:50:31,906 --> 00:50:33,867
I know a little bit.

606
00:50:35,827 --> 00:50:39,414
I'm sure I probably had
some ancestors fighting in it.

607
00:50:39,497 --> 00:50:41,499
- I just-
- Hmm.

608
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:44,169
- I don't know.
- Probably so.

609
00:50:44,252 --> 00:50:47,797
You ever have dreams
about the Civil War?

610
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:49,841
I can't say that I have.

611
00:50:51,843 --> 00:50:54,262
I do.

612
00:50:54,346 --> 00:50:57,057
We were talkin' about Amos Candler.

613
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,476
Now, Amos, he used to sit...

614
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:01,519
at the end of the family pew...

615
00:51:01,603 --> 00:51:04,773
right there behind us,
in the second row.

616
00:51:04,856 --> 00:51:08,485
He's probably lookin'
over our shoulder right now.

617
00:51:08,568 --> 00:51:12,697
- How's that?
- Part of the great cloud of witnesses.

618
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:17,660
That's, uh-That's unsettling.

619
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:21,414
Well, only if you got something to hide...

620
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:23,750
which, of course, all people do.

621
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:26,002
But I like to think of it as positive.

622
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:29,047
You know, more like
the- the home crowd...

623
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,591
cheering you on at a-
at a football game.

624
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:36,596
So, if he were here...

625
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,683
what would he be yelling
from the grandstand?

626
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:43,645
Given our surroundings
and your pilgrimage...

627
00:51:43,728 --> 00:51:46,356
I'd say he'd probably be yellin'...

628
00:51:46,439 --> 00:51:49,609
"Pray, Josiah!

629
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:51,611
Pray!"

630
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:56,658
Yeah. I don't know much about that.

631
00:52:00,453 --> 00:52:02,497
Mm-hmm.
Well, supposedly...

632
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:06,501
he... often left his pew...

633
00:52:06,584 --> 00:52:09,587
to go kneel and pray
at that altar right there.

634
00:52:12,465 --> 00:52:16,136
You know, I should-
I should be leavin'.

635
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:20,056
Hmm.

636
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:25,186
I'll pray for your journey, son.

637
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:33,862
How'd you know my name was...

638
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:37,657
Josiah?

639
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:39,534
Hello?

640
00:52:41,286 --> 00:52:43,204
Hello!

641
00:52:57,969 --> 00:53:00,680
- Hey.
- Hey. Have you seen the caretaker?

642
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:04,142
Was I supposed to?

643
00:53:05,393 --> 00:53:07,312
Question.

644
00:53:07,395 --> 00:53:10,690
Where can we find out
more about your family?

645
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:15,236
She practically raised me.

646
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,322
Gave me the name Renny.

647
00:53:17,405 --> 00:53:21,201
Said I pecked at my food
like a Carolina wren.

648
00:53:21,284 --> 00:53:24,079
- Mama A.
- Oh!

649
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:26,331
Mmm.

650
00:53:26,414 --> 00:53:29,042
- Mama A, this is Jo.
- Oh, hello, children!

651
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:31,044
- Hi.
- Mmm.

652
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:43,598
But you didn't come here for johnnycakes,
now, did you, boy?

653
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:50,397
What can you tell us
about the Jacobsons?

654
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:56,736
Sad tales.

655
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:03,076
Well, you know,
the old-time Jacobson...

656
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:05,829
the one that made it
through the war-

657
00:54:05,912 --> 00:54:09,124
- J.F.
- Jeremiah.

658
00:54:09,207 --> 00:54:13,086
Now, as I recall, he was a-
he was a rich planter before the war.

659
00:54:13,169 --> 00:54:15,088
Very successful.

660
00:54:17,298 --> 00:54:19,300
What became of him?

661
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:21,469
Got himself killed in a bar fight.

662
00:54:23,138 --> 00:54:25,765
His son, Hiram, went crazy.

663
00:54:26,933 --> 00:54:29,060
Locked himself up in a room.

664
00:54:29,144 --> 00:54:31,855
Died from something
they used to call the apoplexy.

665
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:36,526
- A stroke.
- Mm-hmm.

666
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:41,573
Now, I knew
your father's daddy personally-

667
00:54:41,656 --> 00:54:43,616
who was one unhappy man.

668
00:54:43,658 --> 00:54:46,953
He was lost on his yacht
at sea, right?

669
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:52,125
Left Charleston Harbor one bright,
sunny day and never come back.

670
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:57,213
After that, only your mama
could reach your daddy.

671
00:54:57,297 --> 00:55:00,467
Seemed like he was mad
at the whole wide world.

672
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:04,637
And now him.

673
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:08,350
Ah, it's just-

674
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:11,394
just a tragedy,
that whole Jacobson story.

675
00:55:14,606 --> 00:55:18,401
What about my mother's side,
the Candlers?

676
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:21,696
Not so much money,
but a whole lot more happiness.

677
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,949
I saw the Amos Candler monument.

678
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:27,994
Hmm. Now, he was rich
before the war.

679
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:31,539
By the time it got into
your mama's generation...

680
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:34,167
all that money had done
gone with the wind.

681
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:38,505
What else do you know
about my mother's family?

682
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:45,553
Um, here.

683
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:48,223
Your mama told me
one day you'd come here...

684
00:55:48,306 --> 00:55:51,059
lookin' for answers
about her family.

685
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:56,106
And I knew today was that day.

686
00:55:58,733 --> 00:56:00,694
She wanted me to give you this.

687
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:09,869
How did she know
I was goin' to ask?

688
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:22,215
Dear Renny, I have said prayers for you...

689
00:56:22,298 --> 00:56:25,593
that I believe will be answered
after my death.

690
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:29,055
The letter you hold in your hand
is one of them.

691
00:56:29,097 --> 00:56:33,518
Son, your life has
an ordained purpose.

692
00:56:34,686 --> 00:56:38,231
When you were born,
I named you Josiah.

693
00:56:38,314 --> 00:56:41,359
Josiah was a king of Israel...

694
00:56:41,443 --> 00:56:45,196
a righteous man who confronted
an ancient evil.

695
00:56:46,614 --> 00:56:50,410
I know this may sound strange
and unusual to you...

696
00:56:50,493 --> 00:56:54,039
but I believe Josiah's call
is similar to your own.

697
00:56:55,623 --> 00:56:58,501
There is more to life
than we can see...

698
00:56:58,585 --> 00:57:00,670
with our natural eyes...

699
00:57:00,754 --> 00:57:04,174
or know with our finite minds.

700
00:57:04,257 --> 00:57:07,427
My prayers for you
live on after I'm gone.

701
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:11,348
All my love, Mother.

702
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:13,433
- Hey.
- Hey.

703
00:57:13,516 --> 00:57:16,436
Look, uh, today at the cemetery...

704
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:19,105
I saw every List member
in my family...

705
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:21,691
and they all died
really, really young, Renny.

706
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:24,611
And just-
Will you look?

707
00:57:27,113 --> 00:57:29,824
And then-And then there were
all these- these baby crosses...

708
00:57:29,908 --> 00:57:31,910
and they're all over the place.

709
00:57:31,993 --> 00:57:34,704
I don't know, Jo, okay?
I just, uh-

710
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:38,166
But think about it.
Your father, my father, Bart Maxwell.

711
00:57:38,249 --> 00:57:42,253
- Something's wrong.
- I hear you. I do.

712
00:57:47,676 --> 00:57:50,804
I know you need to get back
to Winston, Salem, but...

713
00:57:50,887 --> 00:57:53,306
I was hoping maybe
you'd follow me to Charlotte.

714
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:56,142
I'd really like to introduce you
to my landlady, Mrs. Stokes.

715
00:57:56,184 --> 00:58:00,814
- It's fine. She reminds me of Mama A.
- Yeah.

716
00:58:07,404 --> 00:58:09,364
- Hickory nuts.
- Oh, thank you.

717
00:58:09,447 --> 00:58:12,492
Put 'em in hot water, boil 'em for 30 seconds
to separate the meat.

718
00:58:12,575 --> 00:58:14,494
Thanks.

719
00:58:14,577 --> 00:58:17,247
Now, you-you be careful, son.

720
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:21,835
Hmm.

721
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:26,506
Is it okay if Joe spends the night?

722
00:58:26,589 --> 00:58:30,010
- My guest room's always available.
- Thanks, Mrs. Stokes.

723
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:34,305
Ah! Barnette's office again. Here you go.

724
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:37,851
Excuse me.

725
00:58:38,977 --> 00:58:42,939
- So you were a missionary?
- Forty-five years.

726
00:58:44,232 --> 00:58:47,360
- And is that your father?
- Mm-hmm.

727
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:49,320
What was he like?

728
00:58:49,362 --> 00:58:51,406
He did his best.

729
00:58:51,489 --> 00:58:53,491
And yours?

730
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:55,744
Absent.

731
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:58,538
Leaves a hole, doesn't it?

732
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,582
A big one.

733
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:04,461
You know...

734
00:59:04,544 --> 00:59:06,629
years ago...

735
00:59:06,713 --> 00:59:11,676
I wrote down every disappointment
on a piece of paper...

736
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,887
forgave each one...

737
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:16,556
and then burned them.

738
00:59:17,932 --> 00:59:22,687
Now I can look at that picture...
and smile.

739
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:24,731
Hmm.

740
01:00:10,985 --> 01:00:13,029
This is where she prays.

741
01:00:50,942 --> 01:00:54,612
- Can you tell Jo I'll be back in a few hours?
- Sure thing.

742
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:58,825
So what do you think?

743
01:01:00,577 --> 01:01:05,540
She's great, but I don't think
it really matters what I think now, does it?

744
01:01:07,584 --> 01:01:09,669
I'll be back soon.

745
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,755
I'm sure you will.

746
01:01:18,553 --> 01:01:20,513
Morning.

747
01:01:20,555 --> 01:01:23,641
Jo, hey! It's Renny.

748
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:26,144
No, everything's fine.
Uh, listen.

749
01:01:26,227 --> 01:01:30,732
I wonder if you wouldn't mind staying
at Mrs. Stokes's house just a couple more days.

750
01:01:30,815 --> 01:01:33,777
Really? Well, that- that'd be great.

751
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:36,780
Okay, I'll, uh-
I'll see you soon.

752
01:01:36,863 --> 01:01:38,782
All right, bye.

753
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,292
I'm worried about him.

754
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:51,336
Mm-hmm.

755
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:54,005
I've prayed for a lot
of people in that room...

756
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:58,426
but recently it's Renny
who keeps sending me back.

757
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:02,013
I don't think you and I are worried
for the same reasons.

758
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:04,307
You wanna tell me?

759
01:02:04,391 --> 01:02:07,686
- Good morning, Bonny.
- Good morning, Renny.

760
01:02:07,727 --> 01:02:11,398
Will you tell Barnette I got the signatures
and I'll have the memo on Monday.

761
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:13,400
- Will do.
- Thank you.

762
01:02:13,483 --> 01:02:15,652
- Mm-hmm.
- Is he here?

763
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:17,696
Right behind you.

764
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:21,616
- Hey, Renny.
- Thomas.

765
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,035
Good to see you.

766
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:27,414
I'm here on behalf of Gus Eicholtz.

767
01:02:28,873 --> 01:02:31,835
Let's get some air.
How ya doin', darlin'?

768
01:02:31,918 --> 01:02:35,088
Gus says we can trust you
on this matter.

769
01:02:36,589 --> 01:02:39,884
The Larochette family
has maintained a tight grip on the List...

770
01:02:39,926 --> 01:02:43,722
and its funds for far too long.

771
01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:46,850
We now believe that Desmond
and a couple of the others...

772
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:51,688
are plotting to tip the scales
even further in their favor.

773
01:02:51,771 --> 01:02:53,815
I don't understand, Thomas.

774
01:02:53,898 --> 01:02:57,277
The List has been going strong
since the Civil War.

775
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,530
Well, Taylor Johnston, a daughter.

776
01:03:00,613 --> 01:03:03,450
Bart Maxwell, no son.

777
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,621
The power of attorney we all
sign enables the List...

778
01:03:08,705 --> 01:03:12,459
to reclaim a member's money
if he dies without a male heir.

779
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:15,211
The power of attorney is invalid
once a person dies.

780
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:18,840
That's very true. Very true.

781
01:03:19,966 --> 01:03:23,011
So who's telling
the Swiss bankers, hmm?

782
01:03:23,094 --> 01:03:25,096
Well, who gets the money?

783
01:03:26,097 --> 01:03:28,975
- Larochette.
- You're kidding.

784
01:03:29,017 --> 01:03:31,853
From the beginning, that family
has been in total control.

785
01:03:31,936 --> 01:03:35,273
And nobody but nobody crosses 'em.

786
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:39,486
Till now.

787
01:03:56,795 --> 01:04:00,507
There's a plan in place,
and you play a big part in it.

788
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,467
Me?

789
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:05,178
I saw the way you stood up
for Miss Johnston the other night.

790
01:04:05,261 --> 01:04:07,764
You got a lot of guts, kid.

791
01:04:07,847 --> 01:04:10,350
We like that.

792
01:04:10,433 --> 01:04:13,019
As it stands now,
there's eight voting members.

793
01:04:13,103 --> 01:04:17,190
But before we put a rubber stamp
on Desmond's distribution plan...

794
01:04:17,273 --> 01:04:22,904
I want you to call for a vote
to replace him as president.

795
01:04:22,987 --> 01:04:26,866
- On what grounds?
- Well, you're an attorney. Be creative.

796
01:04:28,243 --> 01:04:31,871
If Desmond tries a power play,
we'll come up with somethin'.

797
01:04:33,873 --> 01:04:37,877
All we need to act on this
is a simple majority, and we'll have that.

798
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:43,883
Now, Harry and Robert, well, they'll side
with Desmond. That's no big surprise.

799
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:45,927
But the others-

800
01:04:46,011 --> 01:04:49,389
well, the others are with me-
with us.

801
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:52,559
Who'll be the new president?

802
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:55,645
Well, that would be me.

803
01:04:55,729 --> 01:04:58,773
And my first act as president
will be to make a motion...

804
01:04:58,857 --> 01:05:03,737
for distribution of the significantly
larger sum of money...

805
01:05:03,778 --> 01:05:08,033
than any of us, except for Desmond,
of course, has ever seen.

806
01:05:08,074 --> 01:05:11,745
Exactly... how large?

807
01:05:13,663 --> 01:05:17,167
Does 30 million each work for you?

808
01:05:19,919 --> 01:05:24,132
My second act is to give that girl
what is rightfully hers.

809
01:05:27,177 --> 01:05:30,722
You know, you guys...

810
01:05:30,764 --> 01:05:34,100
y'all keep telling me
how great my father was.

811
01:05:34,142 --> 01:05:37,437
- He was.
- Really? Really?

812
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:41,941
Well, what kind of man disinherits
his only son with no explanation whatsoever?

813
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:44,361
Can you answer me that?

814
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:47,906
I didn't think so.

815
01:05:47,947 --> 01:05:52,577
And Desmond Larochette has been
the only person who has helped me so far.

816
01:05:57,165 --> 01:05:59,125
I'm gonna have to think about it.

817
01:06:01,294 --> 01:06:06,383
Well, I'm sure
when the time comes...

818
01:06:06,466 --> 01:06:08,760
you'll make the right decision.

819
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:24,818
Something I've learned, Jo...

820
01:06:24,901 --> 01:06:29,906
is that God's children and his enemies
make the same mistake-

821
01:06:29,989 --> 01:06:33,410
they both underestimate
the power of prayer.

822
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:39,708
Let's keep praying.

823
01:06:43,044 --> 01:06:45,171
Renny Jacobson.

824
01:06:45,255 --> 01:06:50,010
Renny, I want to invite you
to come out to dinner on Friday night.

825
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:52,887
Yeah. Can you do that?

826
01:06:54,014 --> 01:06:56,641
Well, you can stay here the night.

827
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:58,643
Right, no problem. Okay.

828
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:01,604
Listen, I'm gonna put you on to Frank.
He'll give you directions.

829
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:05,150
I'll see you then. All right.

830
01:07:05,233 --> 01:07:09,279
Now, what have we got?
You know, I like that Jacobson boy.

831
01:07:43,271 --> 01:07:46,316
- Would you like a drink, Renny?
- Brandy's fine.

832
01:07:46,399 --> 01:07:51,279
Good. It's a brandy kind of room, isn't it?

833
01:07:51,363 --> 01:07:54,074
Well, down the hatch.

834
01:07:54,115 --> 01:07:56,451
Here's to all of us.

835
01:07:58,244 --> 01:08:01,414
Mmm. Do you play?

836
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:04,084
- From time to time.
- Ah. Mm-hmm.

837
01:08:10,924 --> 01:08:14,761
Desmond Larochette.

838
01:08:17,889 --> 01:08:20,684
- Right there.
- Let's see.

839
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:24,229
A little castle here. Hmm.

840
01:08:24,312 --> 01:08:26,690
Very good. That's good.

841
01:08:26,773 --> 01:08:29,484
Interesting. All right now.

842
01:08:31,945 --> 01:08:37,075
Rook takes pawn.
That would be checkmate.

843
01:08:37,117 --> 01:08:41,663
Smart. That's good. Good.

844
01:08:41,746 --> 01:08:45,041
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

845
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:47,085
You know, Renny...

846
01:08:49,087 --> 01:08:51,631
the benefits of the List are many.

847
01:08:51,715 --> 01:08:56,845
A sense of belonging to history,
to a brotherhood, loyalty.

848
01:08:56,928 --> 01:08:58,972
Prosperity.

849
01:09:00,306 --> 01:09:02,892
Yeah.

850
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:06,354
There's more to your inheritance
than just money.

851
01:09:06,438 --> 01:09:10,859
It's called power, Renny.
There's tremendous power in the List.

852
01:09:10,942 --> 01:09:13,486
It's something that
your daddy knew about.

853
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:17,741
It can either be used
for good or for evil.

854
01:09:21,244 --> 01:09:23,204
Come with me.

855
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:26,875
Here, come here.
Give me a hand a minute.

856
01:09:29,127 --> 01:09:31,838
Now-

857
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,840
Yeah, nice and clean.

858
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:38,928
Now, I want you to totally
have your mind a blank.

859
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:42,182
Touch this. Now, Renny...

860
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:47,520
is there someone in your life,
someone whose heart you wanna touch?

861
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:53,902
Now just concentrate.

862
01:09:53,985 --> 01:09:55,904
Picture them, Renny.
Picture them.

863
01:09:55,987 --> 01:09:58,239
See their face.

864
01:10:00,075 --> 01:10:02,660
Good, good, good.

865
01:10:02,702 --> 01:10:07,457
Now, release the power.

866
01:10:10,794 --> 01:10:14,089
Release the power and touch 'em!

867
01:10:15,632 --> 01:10:17,926
Yeah!

868
01:10:25,558 --> 01:10:28,061
Good. How do you feel?

869
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:34,192
- All right?
- Good.

870
01:10:35,527 --> 01:10:37,487
That's enough for tonight.

871
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:41,408
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night. Sleep well.

872
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,920
Was it the girl?

873
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:56,548
I think so.

874
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,802
I like him.

875
01:11:01,803 --> 01:11:04,639
He's a good man.
He's a good man.

876
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:06,725
Jo?

877
01:12:04,657 --> 01:12:08,661
Yeah, right. Well, let me know
as soon as escrow closes.

878
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:11,498
Right. Oh, Renny. Here.

879
01:12:11,539 --> 01:12:15,710
Yeah, all right.
I'll talk to ya later. All right, bye.

880
01:12:15,794 --> 01:12:18,588
Lawyers! Sit down.
Ah, coffee?

881
01:12:18,672 --> 01:12:21,299
- Please.
- Ah, well...

882
01:12:21,383 --> 01:12:24,010
Renny, I'm real proud of ya.

883
01:12:24,094 --> 01:12:27,806
Real proud of you.
You did real well last night.

884
01:12:27,847 --> 01:12:30,308
- It was exhilarating.
- Exhilarating?

885
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:32,435
- Yes, sir.
- Some milk?

886
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:34,979
- Please.
- Ah.

887
01:12:35,021 --> 01:12:38,983
I think it's time
we had a money talk.

888
01:12:39,025 --> 01:12:43,154
Now I've decided,
given the global economic picture...

889
01:12:43,238 --> 01:12:45,782
I think maybe we should hold off
for a year or two.

890
01:12:45,865 --> 01:12:48,243
What do you say?

891
01:12:48,326 --> 01:12:50,954
Oh. You look disappointed.

892
01:12:51,037 --> 01:12:52,997
Uh, Mr. Larochette-

893
01:12:53,081 --> 01:12:57,043
Listen, son.
I'm always gonna take care of you.

894
01:12:57,085 --> 01:13:00,714
I mean, there'll be tens
of millions soon enough.

895
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:02,674
Sugar?

896
01:13:02,716 --> 01:13:06,511
Help her, Lord. Heal her.

897
01:13:06,553 --> 01:13:09,597
Lord, please, help her.

898
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:12,100
Help her. Help her.

899
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,562
Heal her.

900
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:18,690
Heal her. Heal her.

901
01:13:20,734 --> 01:13:22,944
Heal her.

902
01:13:23,028 --> 01:13:27,198
Help her.
Help her, Lord, please.

903
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:34,372
Heal her.

904
01:13:44,257 --> 01:13:46,217
Thomas!

905
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:50,638
- You were right.
- Of course I was.

906
01:13:50,722 --> 01:13:54,225
- About what?
- No disbursement.

907
01:13:54,309 --> 01:13:57,395
All right, look.
I'll do this on one condition.

908
01:13:57,479 --> 01:14:01,524
I get to be custodian,
like my father, to keep the List.

909
01:14:01,608 --> 01:14:04,652
- You serious?
- Of course I'm serious!

910
01:14:08,823 --> 01:14:11,326
All right, done deal.

911
01:14:11,409 --> 01:14:15,622
All right, look. Before Desmond speaks,
you have make the motion. All right?

912
01:14:15,705 --> 01:14:17,707
- All right.
- You okay with this?

913
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,918
- Yeah.
- All right.

914
01:14:19,959 --> 01:14:23,672
Give me a little head start.
I don't want people to see us walk in together.

915
01:14:33,973 --> 01:14:36,643
Gentlemen, please.
I'd like to call to order...

916
01:14:36,726 --> 01:14:39,979
the 248th meeting of the Covenant List
of South Carolina, Limited.

917
01:14:40,021 --> 01:14:43,692
- I'd like to make a motion.
- So be it, Renny.

918
01:14:43,775 --> 01:14:47,696
I move for the election of Thomas Layne
as president of the List.

919
01:14:47,779 --> 01:14:51,282
- You are crazy!
- The boy has every right.

920
01:14:51,366 --> 01:14:53,451
Is there a second?

921
01:14:53,535 --> 01:14:55,036
I second.

922
01:14:56,705 --> 01:15:00,750
- Discussion?
- I realize I'm a new member...

923
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:04,546
but I think there needs to be
more openness about our finances...

924
01:15:04,629 --> 01:15:06,840
and a more liberal distribution
of funds.

925
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:10,260
Maintaining heavy central control
is no longer necessary, gentlemen.

926
01:15:10,343 --> 01:15:12,554
This isn't 1863.

927
01:15:13,555 --> 01:15:17,183
Do not make his mistake.

928
01:15:17,267 --> 01:15:20,061
It's time for a change.
Look at the small number in this room.

929
01:15:20,145 --> 01:15:23,273
You know it. I know it.

930
01:15:23,356 --> 01:15:25,734
He knows it.

931
01:15:25,817 --> 01:15:29,070
Don't be blinded by commitment
to the past.

932
01:15:31,364 --> 01:15:34,534
Well, you can tell
the man's a lawyer.

933
01:15:36,786 --> 01:15:38,955
Any other discussion?

934
01:15:40,373 --> 01:15:44,002
No? Right.
Well, let's put it to the vote.

935
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:48,131
All those in favor of
Thomas Layne becoming president?

936
01:15:52,969 --> 01:15:54,888
One.

937
01:15:56,556 --> 01:15:58,767
You seconded the motion?

938
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:01,728
Just so we could vote
on it and move on.

939
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:06,232
- I'm perfectly satisfied with Desmond's leadership.
- Well-

940
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,278
Thomas?

941
01:16:10,362 --> 01:16:12,572
Where did you come up
with this bull?

942
01:16:12,655 --> 01:16:17,952
I can assure you I have never had
any aspirations for that office.

943
01:16:18,036 --> 01:16:22,248
Never have, and I'd venture
to say I never will.

944
01:16:25,502 --> 01:16:27,504
Oh, I see.

945
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:30,715
This was a test.

946
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:33,593
If you choose to call it that.

947
01:16:33,635 --> 01:16:35,720
Now, please be quiet.

948
01:16:35,804 --> 01:16:39,808
What on earth
were you thinking, son?

949
01:16:39,891 --> 01:16:42,310
Now, as I was saying...

950
01:16:42,394 --> 01:16:45,188
the sole purpose
of this meeting tonight is...

951
01:16:45,271 --> 01:16:48,191
to discuss the distribution of monies.

952
01:16:48,274 --> 01:16:50,944
Now I propose a distribution from...

953
01:16:50,985 --> 01:16:55,573
the corpus of the List
to our individual accounts-

954
01:16:55,657 --> 01:16:57,617
excluding Renny here-

955
01:16:57,659 --> 01:17:00,453
to the sum of $30 million.

956
01:17:00,537 --> 01:17:05,625
That's 30 million each, gentlemen.

957
01:17:07,794 --> 01:17:10,630
As for Jacobson here...

958
01:17:10,714 --> 01:17:13,883
I move that we delay
any payment of monies to him...

959
01:17:13,967 --> 01:17:17,053
for a probationary period
of, say, 24 months.

960
01:17:17,137 --> 01:17:20,640
No- 36 months.

961
01:17:20,724 --> 01:17:22,142
I second.

962
01:17:23,226 --> 01:17:25,020
Hmm.

963
01:17:34,738 --> 01:17:36,740
Three missed calls.

964
01:18:20,033 --> 01:18:23,495
I ever tell you the story behind this picture?

965
01:18:25,914 --> 01:18:31,378
This is Vusi-Vusi Lakota.
It was taken just outside of Cape Town.

966
01:18:32,837 --> 01:18:35,799
One day someone says
there's a deadly black mamba in the bush...

967
01:18:35,882 --> 01:18:39,177
and that everyone must get inside.

968
01:18:39,219 --> 01:18:42,931
Panic. But not Vusi.

969
01:18:43,014 --> 01:18:47,394
He just calmly grabbed a shovel...

970
01:18:47,477 --> 01:18:49,896
headed straight into the bush.

971
01:18:51,898 --> 01:18:55,694
Thirty minutes later, he came
out holding the dead mamba.

972
01:18:55,735 --> 01:18:58,571
That's when we took the picture.

973
01:18:58,655 --> 01:19:01,074
That night...

974
01:19:01,116 --> 01:19:04,703
I asked him why he did it.

975
01:19:04,744 --> 01:19:09,207
And he just said,
"When you know evil exists...

976
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:12,836
you must fight it."

977
01:19:26,474 --> 01:19:28,476
The ledger.

978
01:20:50,892 --> 01:20:53,561
Welcome back.

979
01:20:54,688 --> 01:20:56,648
Well, nice to see you again, Renny.

980
01:20:56,690 --> 01:21:00,318
Oh, thank you.
I was just looking for that. Thank you.

981
01:21:00,402 --> 01:21:03,697
Gentlemen, would you mind
giving us a minute?

982
01:21:05,782 --> 01:21:09,202
All right. Well, come with me.

983
01:21:14,374 --> 01:21:17,085
You cannot seize power, Renny.

984
01:21:17,168 --> 01:21:20,380
You have to be groomed for it.

985
01:21:20,463 --> 01:21:23,216
I didn't come here to steal it.

986
01:21:23,299 --> 01:21:25,635
- What did you do to her?
- Me?

987
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:28,304
No. You did it.
That's all right.

988
01:21:28,388 --> 01:21:31,933
We can fix it because
you are the key, Renny.

989
01:21:32,017 --> 01:21:34,394
How am I the key?

990
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:37,272
There were 12 invitations...

991
01:21:37,355 --> 01:21:40,442
to the first meeting in 1863.

992
01:21:40,525 --> 01:21:43,403
Only one of the 12-
a Judas-

993
01:21:43,445 --> 01:21:45,905
decided to go his own way.

994
01:21:45,947 --> 01:21:49,242
What does that have
to do with Jo? Or me?

995
01:21:51,411 --> 01:21:53,788
Amos Candler.

996
01:21:56,374 --> 01:21:59,002
He foolishly then walked away.

997
01:21:59,085 --> 01:22:02,255
Your mother's family
then faced financial ruin.

998
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:06,760
But you- a Candler and a Jacobson-
you complete the List.

999
01:22:06,801 --> 01:22:10,472
Now you've felt the power, right?
How did you describe it?

1000
01:22:10,555 --> 01:22:13,266
Oh, yeah. Exhilarating.

1001
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:17,395
It is written,
"A cord of three strands...

1002
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:20,440
cannot easily be broken."

1003
01:22:20,482 --> 01:22:24,611
Larochette, Candler, Jacobson.

1004
01:22:24,694 --> 01:22:28,948
I can be the father that you so long for.

1005
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:31,159
What about Jo?

1006
01:22:31,242 --> 01:22:35,372
Come on! That's no problem.
No, she can be fine.

1007
01:22:35,455 --> 01:22:38,500
That can be part of
our pilgrimage together.

1008
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:40,877
- How?
- Unity.

1009
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:45,590
It's time for the Candler
and the Jacobson blood to join.

1010
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:49,177
And it's time for you
to stand up and be a man!

1011
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,971
It's time for you
to make your mark!

1012
01:22:53,306 --> 01:22:56,976
And unlike your daddy,
I will be here for you.

1013
01:22:58,895 --> 01:23:01,147
All right.

1014
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:06,027
All right. No way.

1015
01:23:08,196 --> 01:23:10,990
I'm out! It's over.

1016
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:15,495
You better think
about our future, boy.

1017
01:23:15,537 --> 01:23:17,914
Trust me, I have.

1018
01:23:17,997 --> 01:23:20,834
Someone with your potential...

1019
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:24,921
doesn't come along
but once in the generations.

1020
01:23:25,005 --> 01:23:27,340
But let me tell you this.

1021
01:23:27,424 --> 01:23:31,803
Before this is over,
you're gonna be beggin' for mercy.

1022
01:23:35,598 --> 01:23:37,726
Call the police.

1023
01:23:37,809 --> 01:23:39,853
We have an intruder.

1024
01:23:50,363 --> 01:23:52,824
Jacobson, your lawyer's here.

1025
01:24:03,043 --> 01:24:06,546
A.L. Jenkins.

1026
01:24:06,629 --> 01:24:10,133
You can thank Mama A
for bringing me down here.

1027
01:24:11,384 --> 01:24:13,720
That doesn't mean I'm staying.

1028
01:24:13,762 --> 01:24:17,265
You got four charges facing you.

1029
01:24:17,349 --> 01:24:20,226
Criminal trespass,
possession of burglary tools...

1030
01:24:20,268 --> 01:24:24,439
criminal damage to property
and attempted burglary.

1031
01:24:24,522 --> 01:24:27,400
That last one's a felony.

1032
01:24:28,651 --> 01:24:31,196
And, uh...

1033
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:35,367
your law firm just called
the desk sergeant.

1034
01:24:35,408 --> 01:24:38,453
You're fired.

1035
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:46,461
You got one hour.

1036
01:25:09,025 --> 01:25:11,695
Oh, Father...

1037
01:25:11,778 --> 01:25:14,614
God, you got to do something
about Renny now.

1038
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:17,826
I can't help him no more.
I can't.

1039
01:25:17,909 --> 01:25:22,497
You see the trouble he in.

1040
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:26,501
His mommy and daddy
leave me to care for him.

1041
01:25:26,584 --> 01:25:31,297
But he needs you, Jesus.
I can't help him no more.

1042
01:25:31,381 --> 01:25:33,633
He in this mess
as he is in trouble...

1043
01:25:33,717 --> 01:25:36,553
but, Lord, he just need
to know you, Jesus.

1044
01:25:37,637 --> 01:25:41,099
Help him, Lord.
Help my Renny.

1045
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:43,143
Help my baby boy.

1046
01:25:44,644 --> 01:25:47,105
Oh, Lord.

1047
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:00,869
Save his soul.

1048
01:26:10,086 --> 01:26:12,088
Is that it?

1049
01:26:13,131 --> 01:26:15,550
Yeah.

1050
01:26:15,633 --> 01:26:17,677
You got any evidence?

1051
01:26:17,761 --> 01:26:19,637
No.

1052
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:23,099
I mean, uh, nothing except three dead,
a woman in the hospital...

1053
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:27,312
and me stuck here
about to lose everything.

1054
01:26:30,607 --> 01:26:33,610
What do you want, son?

1055
01:26:33,693 --> 01:26:36,321
What do I want?

1056
01:26:36,363 --> 01:26:38,365
Well, let's see.

1057
01:26:38,448 --> 01:26:41,701
I want the money.
I want the girl.

1058
01:26:41,785 --> 01:26:44,371
And I want no criminal record.

1059
01:26:45,747 --> 01:26:49,626
Okay. No problem.

1060
01:26:49,709 --> 01:26:51,878
Let's just call Desmond Larochette.

1061
01:26:51,961 --> 01:26:56,049
I'm sure he'll be willing to drop
the charges and take you under his wing.

1062
01:27:00,053 --> 01:27:02,389
What do you really want?

1063
01:27:13,817 --> 01:27:16,319
I want Jo to be okay.

1064
01:27:16,403 --> 01:27:18,738
I want no jail time.

1065
01:27:20,031 --> 01:27:23,243
And I would just like...

1066
01:27:23,326 --> 01:27:25,453
to start over.

1067
01:27:26,746 --> 01:27:29,916
Now, that's better.

1068
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,586
We've got problems legal and spiritual,
but we can handle both.

1069
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:38,091
First, let's just face Judge Austin.

1070
01:27:39,134 --> 01:27:41,636
Let's post bail.

1071
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,596
Great.

1072
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:58,278
Larochette.

1073
01:28:43,907 --> 01:28:45,909
Who's there?

1074
01:29:04,094 --> 01:29:06,012
Who are you?

1075
01:29:08,556 --> 01:29:10,850
What do you want?

1076
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:37,168
Renny!

1077
01:29:40,422 --> 01:29:43,008
Oh, shoot. Renny.

1078
01:30:49,032 --> 01:30:52,160
What is this, Lord? Victory?

1079
01:30:55,205 --> 01:30:58,833
What do I need to do?
My strength is almost gone.

1080
01:31:14,891 --> 01:31:20,188
"For I am poured out
like a drink offering...

1081
01:31:20,271 --> 01:31:24,192
"and the time
for my departure has come.

1082
01:31:26,069 --> 01:31:30,990
"I have fought the good fight.

1083
01:31:31,032 --> 01:31:33,785
"I have finished the race.

1084
01:31:36,287 --> 01:31:39,207
I have kept the faith."

1085
01:31:51,886 --> 01:31:55,265
Do you understand that with
a guilty plea to these charges...

1086
01:31:55,348 --> 01:31:58,393
you'll never practice law again?

1087
01:31:58,476 --> 01:32:00,395
Yes, Your Honor, I understand.

1088
01:32:00,478 --> 01:32:03,898
Mr. Jacobson,
you are hereby sentenced...

1089
01:32:03,982 --> 01:32:08,862
to three years confinement
in the South Carolina State Penitentiary.

1090
01:32:12,115 --> 01:32:15,577
Said sentence to be served on probation.

1091
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:21,249
I further order you
not to go on or about...

1092
01:32:21,332 --> 01:32:25,086
the person or the property
of Desmond Larochette.

1093
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:28,506
I hope you get
your life together, son.

1094
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:33,386
Court adjourned.

1095
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:40,727
Well, that's one of your problems solved.

1096
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:42,729
Disbarment?"

1097
01:32:42,771 --> 01:32:45,815
But no jail time.

1098
01:32:47,233 --> 01:32:49,402
Let's walk outta here.

1099
01:32:58,703 --> 01:33:01,373
Robert, inform the members...

1100
01:33:01,414 --> 01:33:05,251
that there'll be a special
meeting tomorrow night!

1101
01:33:06,961 --> 01:33:08,922
So how do we handle Gus?

1102
01:33:08,963 --> 01:33:11,925
Something unique would be nice.

1103
01:33:12,008 --> 01:33:15,011
I called the hospital.
She's still hanging on.

1104
01:33:15,095 --> 01:33:17,097
I'm surprised
she's not dead.

1105
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:19,641
Ah.

1106
01:33:19,724 --> 01:33:23,478
The others submitted
to the power of the List.

1107
01:33:23,561 --> 01:33:26,022
But don't worry.

1108
01:33:26,106 --> 01:33:28,650
I've seen the end
right from the beginning.

1109
01:33:46,292 --> 01:33:48,837
I call that my wall of faith.

1110
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:51,131
Look at their eyes.

1111
01:33:52,674 --> 01:33:55,385
Before God got hold of them...

1112
01:33:55,468 --> 01:33:57,303
and after.

1113
01:34:00,974 --> 01:34:04,936
All those people
had one thing in common-

1114
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:08,189
they thought they were 1,000 miles
from the promised land.

1115
01:34:09,357 --> 01:34:13,945
Truth is, they was
just one step away.

1116
01:34:15,405 --> 01:34:18,700
Amen.

1117
01:34:18,783 --> 01:34:20,994
"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."

1118
01:34:21,077 --> 01:34:23,663
Heal her.
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures"-

1119
01:34:23,747 --> 01:34:25,331
Heal her.
"And leadeth me beside the still waters."

1120
01:34:25,415 --> 01:34:27,334
Heal her.
"He restoreth my soul.

1121
01:34:27,417 --> 01:34:30,795
He leadeth me in the path of righteousness
for his namesake. " Surrender.

1122
01:34:30,837 --> 01:34:35,008
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil"-

1123
01:34:35,091 --> 01:34:38,136
Surrender. Strength. "For thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

1124
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:41,181
"He preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

1125
01:34:41,264 --> 01:34:45,018
"Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup overflows.

1126
01:34:45,101 --> 01:34:48,021
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life.

1127
01:34:48,104 --> 01:34:51,232
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever. "

1128
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:36,403
Yes! Yes,
I, the Lord thy God...

1129
01:35:36,486 --> 01:35:39,030
am a jealous God...

1130
01:35:39,072 --> 01:35:42,701
visiting the iniquities
of the fathers upon the children...

1131
01:35:42,784 --> 01:35:47,080
unto the third and fourth
generation of them that hate me...

1132
01:35:47,163 --> 01:35:49,082
and showing mercy...

1133
01:35:49,165 --> 01:35:52,961
unto the thousands of them
that love me...

1134
01:35:53,044 --> 01:35:56,756
and keep my commandments.

1135
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:59,259
This is what the Lord said.

1136
01:35:59,342 --> 01:36:01,720
I've got something to say.

1137
01:36:02,971 --> 01:36:07,100
I kept asking myself, "Why?"

1138
01:36:07,183 --> 01:36:10,061
Why did my father
leave me nothin'?

1139
01:36:10,103 --> 01:36:12,439
Why did you trick me?

1140
01:36:12,522 --> 01:36:15,692
And why did all this
have to happen?

1141
01:36:15,775 --> 01:36:18,403
And then I realized...

1142
01:36:19,904 --> 01:36:22,574
you're all blind.

1143
01:36:22,615 --> 01:36:26,244
My father. You, Larochette.

1144
01:36:26,327 --> 01:36:28,288
Even you, Gus.

1145
01:36:28,329 --> 01:36:30,623
You're all blinded by this.

1146
01:36:30,707 --> 01:36:34,127
You're nothing but a bunch
of selfish, greedy old men.

1147
01:36:34,169 --> 01:36:37,255
And I don't want any part of it.

1148
01:36:39,466 --> 01:36:42,385
Whatever has happened
in the past...

1149
01:36:42,469 --> 01:36:44,804
whatever will happen
from this point forward...

1150
01:36:44,888 --> 01:36:49,392
your power over me,
over my family...

1151
01:36:49,476 --> 01:36:53,188
over the people I love,
ends now!

1152
01:37:07,619 --> 01:37:11,831
He signed in blood.
I own him.

1153
01:37:22,008 --> 01:37:25,970
Rower? I'll show you power.

1154
01:38:04,718 --> 01:38:06,636
Blessing.

1155
01:38:08,722 --> 01:38:10,682
Blessing.

1156
01:38:13,101 --> 01:38:15,103
Bless-

1157
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:40,670
- What's this?
- It's Daisy's holographic will.

1158
01:38:40,754 --> 01:38:43,298
- Her what?
- It's a will in her own handwriting.

1159
01:38:43,381 --> 01:38:46,760
She wrote it four days ago.
Perfectly legal.

1160
01:38:46,801 --> 01:38:50,472
Believe me, I should know.

1161
01:38:50,555 --> 01:38:52,932
Renny, she gave you the house.

1162
01:38:55,185 --> 01:38:57,687
She gave me a lot more than that.

1163
01:38:57,771 --> 01:38:59,731
They all did.

1164
01:39:33,556 --> 01:39:35,558
So why weren't you?

1165
01:39:36,768 --> 01:39:38,687
Why wasn't I what?

1166
01:39:38,770 --> 01:39:40,772
Crying.

1167
01:39:42,565 --> 01:39:44,984
Well, why were you?

1168
01:39:47,904 --> 01:39:50,532
My entire life
I've been looking for my father.

1169
01:39:50,615 --> 01:39:55,245
So, when we buried him,
that was it. You know?

1170
01:39:55,328 --> 01:39:57,247
I'd never know him.

1171
01:39:58,665 --> 01:40:02,961
But... here, with Mrs. Stokes...

1172
01:40:03,003 --> 01:40:07,590
I think I found what it is
I'm looking for.

1173
01:40:07,674 --> 01:40:09,634
Thank you.

1174
01:40:19,269 --> 01:40:21,187
Isn't it gorgeous?

1175
01:40:26,026 --> 01:40:27,861
Yes, it is.

1176
01:40:31,322 --> 01:40:35,869
This place kind of reminds me of Lake Moultrie
in Charleston where I grew up.

1177
01:40:35,952 --> 01:40:39,873
I was... five years old, I guess...

1178
01:40:39,956 --> 01:40:43,126
the first time my parents
brought me there.

1179
01:40:49,424 --> 01:40:52,886
It's where my father
taught me to swim.

1180
01:40:52,969 --> 01:40:54,888
I was horrible at it too.

1181
01:40:54,971 --> 01:40:59,851
I mean, I'd struggle
in the water, flailing my arms...

1182
01:40:59,893 --> 01:41:02,937
trying anything
I could just to stay afloat.

1183
01:41:04,314 --> 01:41:07,817
My mother,
she'd stand on the bank...

1184
01:41:09,027 --> 01:41:11,613
lookin' down.

1185
01:41:11,696 --> 01:41:14,616
She'd just pray.

1186
01:41:27,879 --> 01:41:30,674
Jo.

1187
01:41:58,243 --> 01:42:01,663
There is something I've learned, Jo.

1188
01:42:01,746 --> 01:42:03,957
God's children and his enemies...

1189
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:07,585
both make the same mistake-

1190
01:42:07,627 --> 01:42:11,297
they both underestimate
the power of prayer.

1191
01:42:12,966 --> 01:42:14,801
Let's keep praying.
