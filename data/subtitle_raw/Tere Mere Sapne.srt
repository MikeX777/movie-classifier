1
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:47,536
It is said that the movements of
stars make or break a person's life.

2
00:00:49,648 --> 00:00:54,142
Or, the day any star
takes a left turn above...

3
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:57,650
...then many new lives will
be born here, below, on earth.

4
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,794
Once, due to these
turns of the stars...

5
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:11,965
...in 1974, two children were born
on the same day at the same time.

6
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:16,863
Many other children too were
born but these two were different.

7
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:21,013
One was born in an ordinary
settlement of Mumbai...

8
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:23,641
...in a South Indian family.

9
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,919
Hey, what do you think
of yourself? Get out!

10
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:34,884
But neither did this child
want to learn the qualities...

11
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,161
...of a Brahmin nor the
South Indian simplicity.

12
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,364
Hey, Balu!

13
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:45,028
His style was different.

14
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:46,471
Mr. Shastri is coming!

15
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,436
His name was Balu.

16
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:55,136
- You think so end of yourself!
- What's the matter?

17
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,880
He plays cards with the
children, at school!

18
00:01:58,217 --> 00:02:00,777
You always keep rebuking him!

19
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:03,385
Balu and his father
never saw eye to eye.

20
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,419
One day, Balu let his
father's lifetime efforts...

21
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:10,158
...go down the drain

22
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:15,899
Watch what I do to your now!
Get out of the house!

23
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,098
Our second artiste, who
was born along with Balu...

24
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,973
...was growing up.

25
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:25,837
Far away, across seven oceans.

26
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:34,448
This is London's Brighton
School. Rahul studies here.

27
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:41,589
The grandson of a millionaire
businessman Shambunath Mehta.

28
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,122
His only heir.

29
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:51,497
Grandpa!

30
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,474
- Rahul dear.
- Uncle Ramu, where is grandpa?

31
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:06,575
Son, grandpa has
gone out for 3-4 days.

32
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:15,483
This is uncle Ramu,
the loyal manager of this house.

33
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,222
The one who can empathize
with Rahul's sentiments.

34
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:24,795
Rahul acquired one too many things.

35
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:28,039
But these stars snatched away
his parents in childhood itself.

36
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,369
This music box gave him
company in his Ioneliness.

37
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:38,706
With which is associated,
a plethora of his parent's memories.

38
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,761
Many years elapsed.

39
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:54,428
Time taught and
showed many experiences.

40
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,238
Balu and Rahul went
on amassing dreams.

41
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:04,474
The time has come today
to fulfil those dreams.

42
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:09,004
Both of them have turned 21 today.

43
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:13,981
Come to wish them
on their birthday.

44
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,690
Hey! Who is it?

45
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:43,444
Happy birthday, dear brother.

46
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:46,477
How did that hoodlum come home?

47
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:51,516
How did he come home, huh?
Rascal, get up!

48
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:56,590
Wow! My father loves me so much!

49
00:04:57,596 --> 00:05:00,030
He cradles me on my birthday.

50
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,967
He had done the same,
20 years ago, when I was a baby.

51
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:09,573
Am I cradling you?
Get up and get out!

52
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:12,067
He is your own son!

53
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:14,902
- Don't you understand, buddy?
- You call me buddy!

54
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,909
How can you be my son?
Despite being a Brahmin...

55
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:20,413
...you smoke, drink
and eat meat! Go to your room!

56
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:23,011
- Don't come here!
- Father!

57
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,219
Why shouldn't he? Have some shame.
It's our son's birthday today.

58
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:30,219
He has become 21 today. Won't
you wish him? You throw him out!

59
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,431
- You be quiet!
- Freshen up, son.

60
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:34,926
I'll feed you 'kheer' (sweet dish)

61
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,992
Watch, mother! Someday,
luck will shine on me too.

62
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:40,567
Really? I shall also
see how that happens!

63
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:43,500
You are not my father, Shastri!

64
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,301
- What did you say?
- Mother!

65
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,941
I think, the father
and son are fighting again.

66
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:51,075
My son's sleep has been disturbed.

67
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,544
Come on, son.
Get dressed soon.

68
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,819
- Happy birthday, brother!
- Hey, Paro!

69
00:05:57,956 --> 00:06:01,687
- Here's your gift.
- Is this any gift? My cab key?!

70
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:06,755
It isn't only a key. There is also
a fantastic sports can with it. Look.

71
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:12,068
At least you gave me a gift.

72
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:16,334
Hey, drive some
sense to your father too!

73
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:39,154
There's no water.
Close the kitchen tap.

74
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:46,066
Shastri!
Where are you quietly hiding?

75
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,965
If you have the
guts, then come out!

76
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:50,867
- He is not at home.
- I know. Therefore I have come.

77
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:56,748
- Here's some 'kheer'.
- Wow! Paro, will you have some?

78
00:06:57,716 --> 00:06:59,240
Get lost!

79
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:03,516
Don't spare that bloody Balu today!

80
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:06,552
Oh God! I'll be damned!

81
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:11,322
Paro, please save my skin
for the last time. Please!

82
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,191
- Who is it now?
- My creditors. Paro, get up!

83
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:19,192
Please! Will you have
some 'kheer'? It's delicious!

84
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:24,566
Paro! Can't you do this
much for your brother? Paro!

85
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:30,272
- Please, Paro!
- For the last time.

86
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:33,478
I swear, I shall
never do this again!

87
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:37,512
- We will surely catch Balu
today. - Let's go and see.

88
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,485
We won't spare him!

89
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:44,093
- Who are you?
- My name is Jaggu.

90
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:46,664
I am Dubai returned.
Is Balu at home?

91
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:47,964
Brother is not at home.

92
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,295
Hey, I am Charusingh.
Balu drives my taxi.

93
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:59,270
- Drive him out!
- We saw the taxi outside.

94
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:01,340
So we thought, he was at home.

95
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:05,044
Well, brother left his
taxi here and has gone out.

96
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,753
No problem, dear. My job
is to lend and take money.

97
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:11,689
This is my profession.

98
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:16,222
I only came to tell Balu that
he has hit a jackpot of Rs.5,000.

99
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:24,100
Have some 'kheer'.

100
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:29,472
Come out. We will feed
you to your hearts content!

101
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,743
Paro, sit in. I'll have
some sweets and come soon.

102
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:37,712
Hey, it's my birthday.
Let's talk amicably.

103
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,446
I shall feed you sweets!

104
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,620
- I told you, I'm full.
- Brother?

105
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:54,562
- Are you okay?
- They're feeding me sweets.

106
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,761
- Hey you!
- Hey, you'll have me killed.

107
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,314
Forget me. Catch him first.
He is escaping.

108
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:26,930
, Fix an appointment...
No, he will be there on time.

109
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:32,904
Happy birthday, Rahul dear.

110
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:41,312
Is it my birthday today?
Thank you, uncle Ramu.

111
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:44,248
You have turned 21 today.

112
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,948
Quickly freshen up.
We'll go to the temple.

113
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:15,911
Rahul dear, come on.

114
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,879
Grandpa must be waiting
for you for breakfast.

115
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:25,184
The managers have come to discuss
about the Japanese shipment.

116
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:28,692
- You may have to go to Japan.
- Really?

117
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:46,702
I hope, grandpa is
in a good mood today.

118
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:53,450
I will surely go to India this
year. Please explain to him, uncle.

119
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,747
He will never refuse you.

120
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:36,023
Good morning, grandpa.

121
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:44,602
Thank you, grandpa.

122
00:11:56,581 --> 00:12:01,041
Rahul, did you
see your birthday gift?

123
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:02,044
No.

124
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,600
This is my third car, uncle Ramu.
You know, I don't want all this.

125
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:25,338
What is it that
you want from life?

126
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:28,607
Grandpa, I want to ask for
something else from you today.

127
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:34,547
If you permit me, then I will
get the answers to many questions.

128
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:38,147
These answers will
tell me my future, grandpa.

129
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:40,582
Balu's future. Pick.

130
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:42,554
Quickly come out
and save me from Balu.

131
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,958
That arrogant Shastri too
is here. Save me from him also.

132
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,422
Or both will be damned!

133
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:54,667
- Wow!
- Wow!

134
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:57,237
Listen to what the
astrologer says, father!

135
00:12:57,909 --> 00:12:59,240
Wow! What a future this boy has!

136
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,909
Wow!

137
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:04,307
According to this, he is destined
for happiness, wealth... everything!

138
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:09,282
He will have a fleet of cars.
Money will fall on his lap!

139
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:11,755
He already has that.
He drives a taxi.

140
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:16,417
Taxi is not written,
in this. He will own cars!

141
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:21,662
Father, whenever I come here,
the parrot picks the same card!

142
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:26,567
- Suppose, all the cards are same,
then? - Certainly not! Pick up your card! ****

143
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,508
- It will be absolutely miserable!
- You said miserable, you demon?!

144
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,206
You have been drinking my
blood since the time you were born.

145
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:36,514
And even now, you ask for a debt.
That's why you bring me here.

146
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:40,978
Balu, I am not going to be
impressed with your card or parrot, Okay?! ****

147
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:44,849
Please consider, father!
It is the question of my future.

148
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:48,192
Your future?
Will a parrot tell you your future?

149
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,592
- My car! My money!
- Here's your future!

150
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,362
- Here goes your future!
- Father!

151
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:56,593
What is it that you want from life?

152
00:13:57,235 --> 00:14:00,636
Grandpa, I only
wish to go to India.

153
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,635
I want Rs.20,000
to go to Dubai, father.

154
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:10,637
- To go to Dubai?
- Yes. I'm only asking for a debt.

155
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:12,945
I'll repay you within
a month, with interest.

156
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:15,216
I will not even give
you a penny! Get lost!

157
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:19,449
- What a father I have!
- Come ahead soon!

158
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:22,358
Here's one rupee!
Buy your bus ticket with it!

159
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:29,356
Stingy man! I asked
for 20,000, and he left in a bus...

160
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:31,029
...leaving me helpless!

161
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:39,874
But whenever I speak of going
to India, you ask me not to.

162
00:14:40,578 --> 00:14:42,136
And that is the only
country which I want to go to.

163
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:47,608
Rahul, that is the
country which I detest.

164
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:50,111
That is the country,
where our factory...

165
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:52,219
...has been incurring
losses since 20 years.

166
00:14:52,824 --> 00:14:56,225
That is the country with
which I wish to have no ties!

167
00:14:56,661 --> 00:15:00,153
But we do, grandpa!
After all, we are Indians.

168
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,325
We were Indians; but aren't anymore.

169
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:06,998
Neither are you,
nor was your mother.

170
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:11,905
She was a fool to go to
India. And she never returned.

171
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:15,704
Today, you wish to repeat history?

172
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:20,040
Look Rahul, I have lost my daughter.

173
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:27,223
- I don't wish to lose you now.
- You won't lose me, grandpa.

174
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:31,355
You'll have me closer to you.
I promise. Please let me go.

175
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:38,492
Rahul, you are very stubborn...
just like your mother.

176
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:43,235
No. Just like my grandpa.

177
00:15:58,356 --> 00:16:00,790
If I throw your bodies
from the seventh floor...

178
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:04,760
...then your corpses won't be
worthy of being eaten even by the dogs! ****

179
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,867
You know how we have bribed
the Labor Commissioner...

180
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:15,766
...and put this
factory under a lock out.

181
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,107
That's your problem, Mr. Mathur!

182
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:22,143
Mr. Kante, the task
will be simplified...

183
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:26,274
...because the power of attorney,
Mr. Rahul, is coming to India.

184
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:29,077
We have been hearing this
since the last 4 months.

185
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,416
The chairman's son is coming
to India. So what we do?

186
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:37,493
Don't worry, Mr. Kante.
Just keep watching.

187
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:40,620
Spare no efforts in
Mr. Rahul Mehta's welcome.

188
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,066
And keep the court
papers ready, understand?

189
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:58,281
Is a leader coming?

190
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:03,052
Our company's owner's son, Rahul
Mehta, is returning from London...

191
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:04,514
...to India for the first time.

192
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:09,022
What's written on the banner, Sir?

193
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:13,827
They mean to wish him
belatedly for his birthday.

194
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:18,096
I know! Even I know that
much of English! He talks big!

195
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,430
- Sir, when was his birthday?
- The day-before-yesterday.

196
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:24,368
The day-before-yesterday?!

197
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,179
What have you done?
You've broken my head!

198
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,176
Forget your head, Sir.
My luck is bad!

199
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:35,910
Do you know, it was my birthday
too on the 9th of October?

200
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:42,156
And look at me! I'm in this
rotten taxi, and that bloody fool...

201
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,154
I see!

202
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,970
Sir, please sit in my office
until your baggage arrives.

203
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,766
Your car too is parked there.

204
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:30,572
Your Vice-Chairman, Mr. Mathur,
has sent you this phone.

205
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:33,806
And has apologized for
not being able to reach on time.

206
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:36,046
You carry on. We'll come.

207
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:41,942
Uncle Ramu, why is
there a crowd outside?

208
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:44,014
To welcome you.

209
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:49,687
The son of such a great man is
coming to India for the 1st time.

210
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:52,956
So, his welcome
will be equally grand.

211
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,969
I know, son.
Go to the office and rest.

212
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:08,706
I'll bring the baggage, okay?

213
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:18,250
Who are you? Leave me!

214
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,202
Hey, I'm not Rahul
Mehta but Rahul Verma!

215
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:37,802
What! Give the garland back.

216
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:47,978
Yes, we need it.

217
00:19:57,895 --> 00:20:01,626
Hey, where are you looking,
Ramsingh? Mirchandani is in front of you! ****

218
00:20:07,605 --> 00:20:10,438
- Hey, you've become so fat!
- Not at all!

219
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:13,210
But how did you recognize me?

220
00:20:13,678 --> 00:20:17,205
Mirchandani is the city's
greatest, private detective.

221
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:19,374
Why do you forget that?

222
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:24,254
Therefore, grandpa has hired me to
look after Rahul. Where's Rahul?

223
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,835
Hey, show me your license
and take the taxi out!

224
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:39,726
What!

225
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:42,096
Hey, show me your license and
take the taxi away from here.

226
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:43,706
I am!

227
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:53,915
What bad luck!

228
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:01,388
Hey! Hey you! Where are you going?

229
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:04,991
Look at him. He will book me!

230
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,421
Look at his face!
He can see Rs.100!

231
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:10,665
I'll give the money.
Please let's go!

232
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:13,169
Take the taxi out, or
I'll break your leg!

233
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:15,663
I beg of you to
please go from here!

234
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:18,802
- I'll break your other leg too!
- What's going on? Quiet!

235
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,272
Quiet!

236
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,845
Hey, stop honking!

237
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:25,980
Take away your taxi!

238
00:21:30,354 --> 00:21:34,085
Wow! What a bomb!

239
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:39,993
Hey, Romeo! First, take your
taxi away or I'll break your leg!

240
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:44,257
He's breaking my leg, while he's
folding his hands... I'll leave!

241
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:46,964
Hey, stop!

242
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,871
Hurry! We are already late.

243
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:02,647
- Did you find out anything?
- I searched the whole airport.

244
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,750
But of no avail.

245
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:10,359
He left for the hotel.

246
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:13,529
No problem.

247
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,297
- Where do you want to go, Sir?
- I've to go to Hotel New Castle.

248
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:19,434
But first, take me around Mumbai.

249
00:22:19,704 --> 00:22:22,138
Sir, when people come from
abroad, they are loaded with baggage.

250
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,766
But you have come empty handed.

251
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:27,401
That's because I haven't come from
abroad. I came to receive someone.

252
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:30,680
I see! That son of a rich father?

253
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:34,215
- Who?
- Rahul... Rahul Mehta.

254
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:36,146
Had you come to garland him?

255
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:38,948
Y... y... yes!
I had come to meet him.

256
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:43,189
How fortunate that bloody fool is!

257
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:48,858
Sir, do you know he and me share
the same birthday? - 9th October.

258
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:52,964
He is even born in
the same year - 1974!

259
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,534
The snafu created by
the Lord above is strange.

260
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,144
Snafu? What's that?

261
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,878
Snafu means a mix-up, confusion.

262
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,911
"Strange is your way,
strange is your play".

263
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:12,718
"You gave a silver
spoon in the mouth of a rat!"

264
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:15,389
My plight is similar.
God willed that rat to be born...

265
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,557
...in a millionaire's
home and me, in

266
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,522
What a miserable life!

267
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,435
Slog hard day and night,
but the outcome is the same.

268
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:29,701
But money isn't everything
in this world, my friend.

269
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,905
You possess a very
precious thing - freedom.

270
00:23:33,444 --> 00:23:37,346
My foot! Freedom is fine
only up to the 15th of August!

271
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,683
I do not want freedom after that!

272
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:42,779
I want dough, hard cash!

273
00:23:43,654 --> 00:23:45,383
A bungalow to reside,
in, a car to roam around...

274
00:23:45,656 --> 00:23:48,921
...a retinue of people
all around, to salute you!

275
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:51,691
I have heard that the rich too
have their pot full of sorrows.

276
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,487
Then bestow me with all the sorrows!

277
00:23:53,798 --> 00:24:00,033
Give me cancer, ulcer...
and I won't even whimper a protest.

278
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:04,434
But give me dough too,
which that swine has.

279
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:09,706
And in which he is rotting.
I swear, I too want to rot that way!

280
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:15,448
You are a very interesting
man, friend and extremely lovable.

281
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:18,319
Really, sir?

282
00:24:22,193 --> 00:24:25,026
Hey, a cordless too?
That's real cool!

283
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,531
Why is the phone getting
disconnected every time?

284
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,300
Is it possible that he has
directly gone to the hotel?

285
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:36,730
Tell me something.
Where is St. Andrew's Church?

286
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:40,336
- Hey, that's very far from here.
- Take me there.

287
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:44,309
There's a 'paan' (betel leaf)
Shop on the way owned by Guruji.

288
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:46,378
The 'paan' there...

289
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,177
- 'Paan'? What's that?
- Don't you know what it is?

290
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:52,754
'Paan'? Let's go.

291
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,398
Good-day. How are you?

292
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:07,160
Prepare two 'paan' for us...
Sir, how do you want yours to be?

293
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:11,932
- Just like yours.
- Make both yummy? Add tobacco.

294
00:25:13,344 --> 00:25:17,110
Forget about eating 'paan'.
You've been eating it for free since 2 months! ****

295
00:25:17,381 --> 00:25:19,406
Pay first! Then you'll get 'paan'.

296
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,809
Hey, am I going to
run away? I will pay!

297
00:25:24,288 --> 00:25:29,316
Respect me a little.
Sir is with me.

298
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,162
Don't call me sir. I am your
friend. Call me by my name - Rahul.

299
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:38,167
- How much is it?
- No, sir. Why should you pay?

300
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:39,598
My credit goes on.

301
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,530
Take this.

302
00:25:48,112 --> 00:25:53,345
You con Balu? You indulge
in smuggling, wearing a suit?

303
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,914
Hey, since when did you
start this illegal business?

304
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:01,254
Did you print this note
at home huh? Smart lass!

305
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:08,564
You show a passport? Is it fake?
...And that too, a British passport?

306
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,867
Wow! An illegal
business, in London style!

307
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:28,040
I called such an affluent man, a rat!

308
00:26:28,452 --> 00:26:32,718
He can buy me with
my taxi! What do I do?

309
00:26:34,358 --> 00:26:42,060
Come on! I'll sit in the front.

310
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,736
Please do. It is
your taxi, Mr. Rahul.

311
00:26:47,471 --> 00:26:49,905
Hey, Balu! Take the 'paan'.

312
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:53,633
But the next time, I will not
give it to you for free!

313
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:55,702
Thank you!

314
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:17,797
- Has Mr. Mehta come?
- Not yet. The press, too, await him.

315
00:27:20,037 --> 00:27:22,631
What do I do now?

316
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:28,979
Do one thing. Tell him that
Mr. Mehta left directly for Delhi.

317
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,049
There is no need to tell anybody
anything for the time being.

318
00:27:32,716 --> 00:27:37,779
You need not worry.
I'll just go and get rid of them.

319
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:40,385
- But Rahul?
- He too will come.

320
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:43,686
He has come from London, not from
a village, that he will get lost.

321
00:27:44,128 --> 00:27:47,859
And don't forget,
Detective Mirchandani is with you.

322
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:51,399
I'll go and tackle them.

323
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,335
Hello, Ramsingh.
Did you reach safely?

324
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:06,578
- Yes, we did.
- Fine. Get Rahul on the line.

325
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:11,143
- Well, he is...
- Say that he is in the bathroom.

326
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,149
- He is in the bathroom.
- As soon as he comes out...

327
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:16,322
...have him talk to me.
- Okay.

328
00:28:16,794 --> 00:28:19,126
- He is happy, isn't he?
- He is very happy.

329
00:28:19,563 --> 00:28:21,394
Good. Have him talk to me soon.

330
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:26,095
You are unnecessarily getting
worried. Everything will be fine.

331
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,468
I'm here.

332
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:30,597
Wonder where Rahul is.

333
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:35,372
Mr. Rahul... no... buddy.

334
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:42,685
If my father were to give me
Rs.20,000, then I'd go to Dubai.

335
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:46,479
Earn 200,000 - 300,000 in 2 years
and have my own business in Mumbai.

336
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:49,716
Look here. I am trapped in a cobweb.

337
00:28:51,295 --> 00:28:54,355
You are very fortunate, friend.
I wish, I were in your shoes.

338
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:57,358
If you were in my shoes, then
you'd have got a father like Shastri.

339
00:28:57,701 --> 00:29:00,226
You would have committed
suicide in just two days!

340
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:02,105
At least, you have a father.

341
00:29:03,874 --> 00:29:06,365
- Hello, Grandpa?
- Who is it?

342
00:29:12,116 --> 00:29:15,813
- So you've come out?
- From where?

343
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,022
- From the bathroom. Where else?
- From the bathroom?

344
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:21,651
Yes. Ramsingh mentioned that
you were in the bathroom.

345
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:23,583
I see! So, you've
already spoken to him?

346
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:26,794
Yes. Didn't he mention it to you?

347
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:30,458
I had told him to ask
you to telephone me.

348
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:32,497
Yes. That's why I have called you.

349
00:29:34,138 --> 00:29:36,663
- How did you like India?
- Hey, hang up!

350
00:29:37,808 --> 00:29:40,538
- What's the matter?
- Grandpa, I've eaten 'paan'.

351
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,309
- It's very delicious.
- Delicious, my foot!

352
00:29:43,981 --> 00:29:47,542
Immediately, spit if out. Until
then, give the phone to Ramsingh.

353
00:29:47,918 --> 00:29:51,012
I will kill him.
How did he let you eat 'paan'?

354
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:53,647
Give him the phone immediately.
Where is that rascal?

355
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,620
Well... he is in the bathroom.

356
00:29:57,094 --> 00:29:58,755
Knock on the door, thump it!

357
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:14,377
Whenever this city of Mumbai
gets on my nerves, I come here.

358
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:18,037
I swear, buddy,
I find immense peace.

359
00:30:19,116 --> 00:30:21,084
Balu, do you know, I
was born here in Mumbai?

360
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:22,713
Really?

361
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:26,754
My parents died in an accident.
When I was only 2 years old.

362
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:32,025
My grandpa took me to London
from here, where I grew so big.

363
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:35,129
But my heart always
pined to come to India.

364
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:38,834
I wanted to see the house in
which my parents used to live.

365
00:30:40,904 --> 00:30:43,896
And the cemetery
where they were buried.

366
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:46,332
Buried? Meaning?

367
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,607
Meaning, my mother was a Hindu
and my father, a Christian.

368
00:30:49,446 --> 00:30:53,382
I am half Hindu and half
Christian. And you are a Brahmin.

369
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:59,278
Only for name sake. My father
considers me to be an untouchable since birth. ****

370
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:02,223
Therefore he doesn't let me
inside the house. I live separately.

371
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,856
He has given it to me
but I pay the rent.

372
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:10,295
One more thing. My grandpa
is a millionaire, not me.

373
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:12,561
I don't claim any
right over his money.

374
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:17,272
And yes! I do have some money.
Do you yet consider me your friend?

375
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,809
Buddy, you were only
a millionaire previously.

376
00:31:21,078 --> 00:31:22,875
But now... you have become precious!

377
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:28,374
- Will come to my tiny house?
- Yes. - You can meet mother too.

378
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:29,784
- Let's go.
- Yes.

379
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,301
- Mother! Father!
- Where did you get this friend from?

380
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:52,301
- He is my friend Rahul.
- Where do you live?

381
00:31:53,377 --> 00:31:54,844
- Pardon?
- Which caste do you belong to?

382
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:59,974
He's... a Hindu, a Brahmin. He
belongs to a higher caste than us.

383
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:02,682
Brahmin? I think,
your friend is very wealthy.

384
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:07,018
He was in Dubai for 2 years.
That's why he has minted money.

385
00:32:07,858 --> 00:32:11,487
Had you also given me Rs.20,000,
I too would have been rich like him.

386
00:32:11,862 --> 00:32:14,626
Don't talk about money.
I'll go and meet Ramnath.

387
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:19,963
- Have you eaten?
- No.

388
00:32:20,504 --> 00:32:21,937
Balu, take him home.
I'll be back soon.

389
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:24,568
- How much one these?
- Rs.40 per dozen.

390
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:28,303
This is my area.
Afzal Tonda stays here.

391
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:31,145
He doesn't let any
chances slip out of his hand.

392
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:34,273
Khalid stays here. An absolute
trickster but he is my buddy.

393
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:38,219
- Hi, Khalidbhai! How are you?
- Absolutely cool!

394
00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:42,618
And Pakhia's house is here.
He used to think, he was too smart!

395
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:45,121
But I whacked him,
and he wet his pants!

396
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:47,294
- Hey, trapped a new
guinea pig? - Hey Michael!

397
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:49,556
Who asked you to talk?
Get lost!

398
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,566
Shall I whack you?
He talks big!

399
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,400
Do one thing. You go.
There's a rotten tap ahead.

400
00:32:57,674 --> 00:33:00,871
Four-five women will be fighting
there. Near it, is a rotten building.

401
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:03,703
I live there. Go there. I'll
settle the matters and come soon!

402
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:09,282
- Hey Balu!
- Don't let him escape!

403
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:28,597
- Where is Mr. Shastri's house?
- This is it.

404
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,012
- Sister, spare me!
- Quiet!

405
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,478
I've been teaching you
a tune since 2 months.

406
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:41,146
Let alone the tune, you couldn't
even learn to hold a violin!

407
00:33:41,752 --> 00:33:43,276
- Wait!
- Please, sister!

408
00:33:43,587 --> 00:33:47,114
Wait or you'll surely see me
flaring today. Don't harass me!

409
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:49,592
- Forgive me, sister.
- Wait.

410
00:33:52,863 --> 00:33:53,761
Alas!

411
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:07,906
What's this Paro? What's wrong
with you? It's turmeric water!

412
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,879
Yes. The maid just left. I was
sprinkling water to sanctify...

413
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,878
...the house. I was throwing
the remaining water, when he came!

414
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:20,185
You should have at least
watched. The poor boy is drenched.

415
00:34:20,624 --> 00:34:22,387
No problem.
He has been sanctified.

416
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:29,598
Look, Balu has come.

417
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:35,200
Go with him and change... Quiet!

418
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:45,078
Why did you lie
about me to your family?

419
00:34:46,116 --> 00:34:48,641
I have to, buddy.
You don't know my father.

420
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:54,151
I can't understand how
to lie this. Please explain.

421
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:56,318
Wrap it around.

422
00:34:57,694 --> 00:34:58,888
Tie a knot here.

423
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,028
And... take this...
and slip it inside!

424
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:08,037
Now watch what a fantastic
sacred thread I make for you...

425
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:10,236
...with the string used for kites...

426
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:15,342
...that all the girls
here will just stick to you.

427
00:35:16,213 --> 00:35:17,237
You have a piano?

428
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,311
It may be a piano for you.
For me, it is a furniture.

429
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:24,582
It is in a bad state.
Does anyone keep a piano this way?

430
00:35:25,055 --> 00:35:27,455
It isn't mine;
it belonged to the previous tenant.

431
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:31,117
He didn't pay. So Shastri
asked him to keep the piano back.

432
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:36,589
It's been here since then...
Beware of Shastri!

433
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:47,876
Here's your sacred
thread. Come here.

434
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:55,846
- Brother.
- Coming.

435
00:35:56,954 --> 00:36:00,287
Come out and witness
the gaiety... Brother!

436
00:36:01,024 --> 00:36:04,721
- I'm coming!
- Hurry!

437
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:11,765
That's enough! I'm going
to complain to the police.

438
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:14,667
Are you mad? Do you
want to put his life in danger?

439
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,703
In danger? Meaning?

440
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:20,635
If you complain to the
police, what will they do?

441
00:41:21,144 --> 00:41:23,078
They will print Rahul's
picture in all the newspapers.

442
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:25,210
Flash it on all the T. V channels.

443
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:28,584
The underworld will learn of
it and they will capture Rahul.

444
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,750
So that they can deal
in millions with grandpa.

445
00:41:35,258 --> 00:41:37,522
Hey, mother! There's
so much peace at home today.

446
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,221
Hey, Shastri is not at home!

447
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:43,989
- Shastri is not at home, indeed!
- You've made very tasty items today.

448
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:47,462
Hey, will you eat all
alone or feed your friend too?

449
00:41:47,904 --> 00:41:50,600
Hey, what's in friendship?
Just attack!

450
00:41:51,274 --> 00:41:52,571
Yes, son. Attack soon.

451
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,609
For, if he attacks, then there will
be nothing left for you, understand?

452
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,378
Take.

453
00:42:02,218 --> 00:42:05,585
Mother, Rahul was saying that he
wanted to eat 'halwa' (sweetmeat).

454
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:07,914
So I said that the
halwa which my mother makes...

455
00:42:08,224 --> 00:42:11,716
...is out of this world! Yummy!

456
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:15,662
You want to eat 'halwa',
and you take Rahul's name instead.

457
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,832
Actually, I have
prepared 'halwa' today.

458
00:42:19,235 --> 00:42:22,295
Fine! Rahul was asking
for it, right? Take, Rahul.

459
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:26,007
- Eat some 'halwa'. Take, son.
- You are my mother...

460
00:42:26,276 --> 00:42:27,174
...and he will eat 'halwa'?

461
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:30,208
- Rahul was saying so, son!
- Please give me, mother.

462
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,971
- Rahul was saying so, son!
- Feed me with your hands, mother.

463
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:39,377
- Feed me!
- Take, son.

464
00:42:39,689 --> 00:42:43,648
Brother, I've washed all his
clothes and removed the stains too.

465
00:42:44,294 --> 00:42:47,889
Rahul, stay back for a day or two.

466
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:50,658
We'll roam around,
watch movies, huh?

467
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:55,362
Hey! Stay here for a day
or two. We'll have fun.

468
00:42:55,772 --> 00:42:56,397
Yes.

469
00:42:56,673 --> 00:42:58,265
Even I don't feel like going.

470
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,143
I've had food prepared by
a mother for the first time.

471
00:43:02,445 --> 00:43:04,538
- Shall I stay back?
- No asking in friendship.

472
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:05,643
Just do it.

473
00:43:06,983 --> 00:43:09,816
- No. Uncle Ramu will be worried.
- Then telephone him.

474
00:43:10,687 --> 00:43:12,382
- Shall I talk to him?
- No, I will.

475
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:17,586
- Uncle Ramu?
- Rahul dear?

476
00:43:19,429 --> 00:43:21,590
Rahul dear, I long
to hear your voice.

477
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:26,094
I know. I called, so that
you can sleep in peace.

478
00:43:27,337 --> 00:43:30,306
How can I, when you
are not in front of me?

479
00:43:30,974 --> 00:43:33,909
- Are you in trouble?
- No, uncle. I'm absolutely fine.

480
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,341
And I am really
enjoying wherever I am.

481
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,442
I have experienced what
life is, for the first time.

482
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:48,286
- So I won't be able to come.
- No, son. Don't do this.

483
00:43:49,492 --> 00:43:50,959
There is a press
meeting at noon tomorrow.

484
00:43:51,494 --> 00:43:53,792
The board meeting follows it.
Will you attend?

485
00:43:54,197 --> 00:43:58,531
- Yes and no.
- Meaning?

486
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:02,036
Meaning, someone else will
attend the meeting instead of me.

487
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:07,733
Hey, have you gone mad? How can
someone else impersonate you?

488
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:11,805
He surely can. Look, other than
Mirchandani and yourself...

489
00:44:12,115 --> 00:44:14,174
...nobody else knows who I am.

490
00:44:15,251 --> 00:44:18,584
People will accept anyone whom
both of you present as Rahul Mehta.

491
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,189
And yes. Take care of yourself.

492
00:44:37,407 --> 00:44:39,272
Are you mad?
How can I impersonate you?

493
00:44:40,043 --> 00:44:44,275
- They'll hand me over to the
police. - They will not. I've spoken to them. ****

494
00:44:45,014 --> 00:44:50,213
Now listen. Go straight to
the hotel and confidently say...

495
00:44:50,553 --> 00:44:54,717
Then watch what a red
carpet welcome you receive!

496
00:44:55,258 --> 00:44:58,591
And from where am I going
to get Rahul Mehta's confidence?

497
00:45:01,097 --> 00:45:04,828
Look Balu, if you imagine
that you are Rahul Mehta...

498
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,193
...the sole heir to
72 factories and companies...

499
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:11,668
...across 16 countries, then
you'll gain confidence naturally.

500
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:18,579
I won't, buddy! You go.
These complications are beyond me.

501
00:45:19,015 --> 00:45:20,039
You are too much!

502
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:25,046
Why are you scared? I'm with you.

503
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:33,751
Look, suppose you do become
a rich man tomorrow, then?

504
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,706
No, this cannot be.

505
00:45:53,149 --> 00:45:54,707
This can't be.

506
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,814
Can I really become rich?

507
00:46:02,225 --> 00:46:04,216
Why not? You surely can.

508
00:46:05,862 --> 00:46:08,160
- Wow!
- If you wish. Do you want to?

509
00:46:09,732 --> 00:46:14,226
- I do want to.
- Then your path is over there.

510
00:46:15,004 --> 00:46:15,971
And yours?

511
00:46:32,855 --> 00:46:35,380
- So, will you be staying there?
- No. Only for 2-3 days.

512
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:36,818
Have I ever stayed away from you?

513
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:41,362
I had banned you from coming
home. Why have you come?

514
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,990
I have not come to meet
you but to meet mother.

515
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,996
Forget it.

516
00:46:48,171 --> 00:46:50,264
- Don't talk to strangers.
- I've already stopped doing it now.

517
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,973
- Take care of your things.
- Yes, I will!

518
00:46:52,275 --> 00:46:54,800
- Taken everything you need?
- Yes, I have.

519
00:46:55,645 --> 00:46:59,046
- Have your meals on time.
- There are many to take care of me.

520
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:03,285
- Look, do have milk at dusk.
- Milk at dusk? I will have.

521
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,087
- What kind of a job is yours?
- It is a very good job, mother.

522
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:09,888
I'll be interacting with big shots.

523
00:47:10,293 --> 00:47:12,386
I have given up mixing
with such commoners.

524
00:47:12,695 --> 00:47:14,629
Who will give you a job, huh?

525
00:47:15,765 --> 00:47:19,201
He has failed in class X, 10 times!
You will get one job! This!

526
00:47:20,703 --> 00:47:22,398
This is also an art!
What do you know?

527
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:24,633
Don't impede him when he is
leaving for work!

528
00:47:25,408 --> 00:47:27,000
Hey, move aside!

529
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:29,038
Bye, Paro. Take care.

530
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:33,180
- Get lost!
- I am going!

531
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:35,847
- Hey, you left this, son.
- I'll eat it, mother.

532
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:37,417
Read further!

533
00:47:46,195 --> 00:47:50,256
Who's it...
Brother, it's your phone.

534
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:57,037
Who's it? ...Mr. Kante?

535
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,641
What do I do about you, Mathus?
When we met...

536
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:03,437
...you had said that the chairman's
son would be coming to India.

537
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,271
- Has he come?
- Yes, he has, Mr. Kante.

538
00:48:06,816 --> 00:48:09,046
- So what have you done?
- Two days later...

539
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,514
...there will be a Board of
Directors' meeting. We'll assemble there. **

540
00:48:12,255 --> 00:48:14,280
I'll have the documents signed
as soon as I get a chance.

541
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:18,153
Mathus, you are so
foolish that I pity you!

542
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:20,729
Therefore, I spare you every time.

543
00:48:21,497 --> 00:48:24,523
If you act smart this time, then
I will have you leave...

544
00:48:24,867 --> 00:48:26,391
...this world, understand?

545
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,060
This is Mathus family's
promise to you.

546
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,667
After eating so much of our money,
you can't sign on one paper?

547
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:36,209
We had so many tenants vacate the
place because you wished so!

548
00:48:36,512 --> 00:48:39,845
Remember one thing! Even if I
have to walk over your dead body...

549
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,712
...and build a building here,
I will not hesitate, understand?

550
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,384
Hit the bloody swine!

551
00:48:46,055 --> 00:48:47,022
Stop!

552
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:11,476
- Hey, where are you going?
- Hey, look there!

553
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:19,821
- Excuse me.
- Hey, move aside!

554
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:41,566
This is all I could rattle!
That's the end of my confidence!

555
00:49:45,848 --> 00:49:51,787
Sir, there's a man here. He says,
his name is Rahul Mehta.

556
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:53,882
- Should I send him upstairs?
- No!

557
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:57,450
We will come down to receive
him. He... he is our boss.

558
00:50:06,402 --> 00:50:10,964
I'm extremely sorry, sir. I didn't
recognize you, and misbehaved.

559
00:50:11,207 --> 00:50:13,266
It's all right, buddy!

560
00:50:14,043 --> 00:50:16,034
I've got used to hearing this much.

561
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:19,848
I swear, if you say a word more,
then I'll break you right here!

562
00:50:22,618 --> 00:50:24,882
Hey! What a groovy lass!

563
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,353
My my!

564
00:50:28,391 --> 00:50:33,294
I swear, I should pack her
and take her home!

565
00:50:33,896 --> 00:50:35,295
Impertinent loafer!

566
00:50:53,716 --> 00:50:54,705
I think, he is Ramsingh.

567
00:50:55,618 --> 00:50:59,418
Oh God! What specimen has
Rahul sent?

568
00:51:00,756 --> 00:51:02,314
He looks a hoodlum.

569
00:51:04,427 --> 00:51:05,257
What a snob!

570
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:14,894
Oh dear, where have you trapped me?

571
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:22,208
Hey, what a gorgeous room!

572
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:25,812
What fun it would be if Paro and
mother were here!

573
00:51:28,217 --> 00:51:31,448
I swear, my life will be
made here!

574
00:51:33,589 --> 00:51:35,420
Hey, it's great!

575
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:40,826
Hey, what are you doing?
Leave me!

576
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:42,863
How could you dare to
come here as Rahul?!

577
00:51:43,499 --> 00:51:46,491
Answer truthfully, with which
here are you associated?

578
00:51:47,503 --> 00:51:48,470
- Me?
- Yes.

579
00:51:48,804 --> 00:51:50,431
- Your gang has how many more men?
- Gang?

580
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,673
Where have you kidnapped my boss?
Tell me soon where Rahul is or...

581
00:51:54,944 --> 00:51:58,812
Hey! I have no gang!
And I am no hoodlum!

582
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:02,148
I haven't kidnapped your Rahul!
He's living there on his own volition.

583
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:04,612
And I'm not fond of staying here,
understand? Look there!

584
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:18,697
Who's it? Rahul?

585
00:52:23,439 --> 00:52:28,502
Yes. There is no difference between
the man who is with you now, and myself. **

586
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,838
Because of him, I am
very happy today.

587
00:52:34,283 --> 00:52:39,949
Uncle, if you get to know him
once, you will love him.

588
00:52:40,923 --> 00:52:44,916
Rahul dear, I want to meet you.

589
00:52:45,294 --> 00:52:47,319
Uncle, please! I want to stay
here for a few more days.

590
00:52:53,903 --> 00:52:57,999
Fine. If you say so, then...

591
00:53:03,646 --> 00:53:04,510
Order for some juice.

592
00:53:40,049 --> 00:53:41,949
Not understanding?
Fool!

593
00:53:51,427 --> 00:53:52,394
You understand English?

594
00:55:44,573 --> 00:55:45,631
What's all this, Paro?

595
00:57:10,459 --> 00:57:12,222
- What did you say your name was?
- Rahul.

596
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:16,196
Yes! Your father was a
very noble man.

597
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:21,501
So was your mother. She was a
very strong and understanding lady.

598
00:57:22,504 --> 00:57:25,029
- Yes! Your mother was a Hindu.
- Yes.

599
00:57:25,774 --> 00:57:27,469
Everybody was dead against
their marriage.

600
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,874
But they loved each other so much
that they silenced everybody.

601
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:33,474
And they got married in this Church.

602
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,414
Your father used to
play the piano very well.

603
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:39,651
He was very fond of
teaching children.

604
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:44,887
Sometimes, he would even begin
in the church itself.

605
00:57:45,594 --> 00:57:48,290
Your father was my younger
brother's good friend.

606
00:57:49,798 --> 00:57:53,564
He would often come to my house.
Therefore, I know about him.

607
00:58:02,878 --> 00:58:05,847
Father, I wish to
visit their graves.

608
00:58:06,515 --> 00:58:09,416
Their graves aren't here.
Perhaps, it is at Mahalaxmi.

609
00:58:10,185 --> 00:58:13,518
Father Braganza will come after a
week. We'll find out from him.

610
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,755
Meet him. Okay?

611
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:25,732
Are you married?

612
00:58:29,638 --> 00:58:30,468
No, father.

613
00:58:31,106 --> 00:58:34,337
But you surely must be in love
with someone, huh?

614
00:58:35,911 --> 00:58:38,038
My child, remember one thing.

615
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:41,950
Whatever you do in life,
do it ****

616
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:47,714
Like your parents. May your
parents' souls rest in peace.

617
00:58:58,901 --> 00:59:02,530
Hold it like this... with this
hand and cut it.

618
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:07,670
You should hold it this way.

619
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:12,147
Just a minute...
What's your name?

620
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:19,114
- And yours?
- Eeshwarkumar Mirchandani. Why?

621
00:59:19,621 --> 00:59:24,422
Aren't you ashamed?
You are named after Gods...

622
00:59:24,626 --> 00:59:27,220
...and you eat food like
you are doing a post-mortem!

623
00:59:28,063 --> 00:59:31,965
Hey, God's given 2 hands. Use it to
the fullest. I'll demonstrate.

624
00:59:33,635 --> 00:59:34,499
Look.

625
00:59:46,181 --> 00:59:49,344
- Balu, how are you?
- Hey, Rahul! How are you?

626
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:53,745
- First class!
- First class? You're learning!

627
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:56,123
Tell me, where are you calling from?

628
00:59:56,558 --> 00:59:58,389
- Where are you?
- At the dining table.

629
00:59:58,827 --> 01:00:01,887
I am in the taxi,
waiting at the red signal.

630
01:00:02,364 --> 01:00:06,164
- Hey, I feel very sad hearing it.
- Certainly not! I'm enjoying.

631
01:00:07,069 --> 01:00:11,199
- I am in love.
- You? In love? You're improving!

632
01:00:11,607 --> 01:00:14,167
- Tell me, who is she?
- She is extremely lovely, buddy.

633
01:00:14,443 --> 01:00:17,469
- Have you spoken to her?
- Not yet. - Why?

634
01:00:18,113 --> 01:00:22,482
I'm very scared. It's first love.
I don't know how to tell her...

635
01:00:22,818 --> 01:00:23,978
...from where to begin.

636
01:00:24,353 --> 01:00:29,052
Take the Lord's name and buy her
some thing nice from your first pay.

637
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:30,688
Suppose she returns the gift, then?

638
01:00:31,193 --> 01:00:36,062
Then it's your bad luck.
But if she accepts it...

639
01:00:36,398 --> 01:00:38,866
...then the green signal will
turn on the line will be clear.

640
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:45,832
I'm speaking from my cordless.
I can't talk much. I'm very busy.

641
01:00:46,608 --> 01:00:49,771
I am fed up with these meetings
and press conferences. Bye.

642
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,545
Look, think before you
talk in the press conference.

643
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:55,648
The reporters read a bit
too much between the lines.

644
01:01:04,626 --> 01:01:07,959
- Please make way.
- Hey, shall I break your headlight?

645
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:11,092
Oh, photographs?

646
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:15,768
You clicked, then move aside.
Hey beardie, you click.

647
01:01:17,506 --> 01:01:18,734
Wow, this is great!

648
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:43,991
This is no way. Sit properly!

649
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:52,968
Brother, our work
will become easier now.

650
01:01:53,775 --> 01:01:57,108
Uncle Ramu, what are the traffic
police doing with this Mercedes?

651
01:01:57,946 --> 01:02:01,279
Rahul dear, he's
Vidyacharan Mathur.

652
01:02:02,184 --> 01:02:03,674
The vice-chairman
of General Products.

653
01:02:07,322 --> 01:02:09,313
He is my younger brother
Shamcharan Mathur.

654
01:02:10,325 --> 01:02:12,816
The company's general manager.
And he is my youngest brother.

655
01:02:13,061 --> 01:02:14,050
I'm very pleased to meet you.

656
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:20,127
Uncle Ramu, does this company
belong to Mehta or Mathur?

657
01:02:20,736 --> 01:02:22,829
I think, grandpa has
employed them in dozens!

658
01:02:23,672 --> 01:02:26,607
For a while, I thought my
name had become Rahul Mathur!

659
01:02:30,879 --> 01:02:32,141
She's my daughter Pooja.

660
01:02:32,781 --> 01:02:34,078
The company's
Public Relation Officer.

661
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:38,584
Daddy, I think I have
seen him somewhere.

662
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:42,889
He's coming to India for the first
time. You must have seen someone else.

663
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,754
For example, all the
taxis in Mumbai look alike.

664
01:02:48,797 --> 01:02:50,822
Similarly, people too look alike.

665
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:55,261
Take your Mathur family, for
example. But you're an exception.

666
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:58,401
You are different.

667
01:02:59,441 --> 01:03:05,778
- She'll take you around Mumbai.
- Implying, the meter is down!

668
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,080
125.

669
01:03:30,405 --> 01:03:33,568
Sister, when I grow up, will
I also have to study so many books?

670
01:03:34,643 --> 01:03:37,635
You just can't concentrate
on studies and you talk big!

671
01:03:37,946 --> 01:03:40,676
At the speed with which you're
going, you'll end up at a grocer's shop. ****

672
01:03:44,686 --> 01:03:47,985
Sister... I haven't seen
Uncle Pianist since yesterday.

673
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:54,424
He's very nice, isn't he?
He plays the piano so well.

674
01:03:56,898 --> 01:03:58,763
Sister, here's Uncle Pianist.

675
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:22,488
I was going home...
I saw both of you.

676
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:26,757
I thought, even you were
going there. I'll reach you.

677
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:34,397
Let's go, sister.

678
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:35,532
Let's go.

679
01:05:04,366 --> 01:05:06,163
Shall we go to eat an ice-cream?

680
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:43,661
Hey, you spilt all the milk!

681
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:05,176
Hey you! You park your
taxi in a No Entry lane?

682
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:08,414
Come out. Isn't this the same cab...

683
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:11,385
...that had broken the traffic
light at the airport the other day?

684
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:16,724
Come out. Show me your license.

685
01:12:21,903 --> 01:12:23,200
Is this a license or a credit card?

686
01:12:24,439 --> 01:12:27,738
- It is an international license.
- I know that.

687
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:30,706
First tell me, where would
you drive a taxi before this?

688
01:12:31,346 --> 01:12:33,439
- In London.
- In which district is it?

689
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:41,986
- Is this a walkie talkie?
- No, a mobile phone.

690
01:12:43,057 --> 01:12:49,826
Balu, do something. A traffic
cop is after my life. What do I do?

691
01:12:50,832 --> 01:12:53,392
That's all? Give him
Rs.10-20 and close the matter.

692
01:12:54,068 --> 01:12:56,127
- Hurry!
- Okay! Just a minute.

693
01:13:01,843 --> 01:13:03,572
Amazing! I think he got
scared seeing the phone.

694
01:13:04,312 --> 01:13:06,872
- Now speak.
- I'm thoroughly enjoying myself.

695
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:11,315
- And even I'm stuck in the traffic.
- Meaning. - Try and understand!

696
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,253
- I've met with an accident.
- With whom?

697
01:13:16,057 --> 01:13:17,718
- There is someone.
- How does she look?

698
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:23,224
If you see her, you'll
go crazy. That latest model of 96!

699
01:13:25,099 --> 01:13:27,329
But I'm scared
of going close to her.

700
01:13:27,635 --> 01:13:31,867
- Scared? And that too, you?
- She's very posh, like you.

701
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:36,169
Now, you find a way which
will make my driving easy.

702
01:13:37,111 --> 01:13:39,739
Fine, I'll tell you.
Listen intently.

703
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:48,987
Hey, you are a maestro, buddy.
I was planning to seek your advice.

704
01:13:49,657 --> 01:13:52,125
But you turned the
tables on me. Okay, listen.

705
01:13:53,094 --> 01:13:57,030
It's an everyday hassle!
Looks like all of Mumbai's water...

706
01:13:57,532 --> 01:13:58,760
...is only in this tap!

707
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,398
Look, buddy. Listen carefully.

708
01:14:00,902 --> 01:14:08,638
First of all, slowly
try to find out what she likes.

709
01:14:09,277 --> 01:14:13,373
And do just that. Woo her in style!
Buy her flowers, clothes, jewelry...

710
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:20,021
And become exactly the
way she wants to see you.

711
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:26,152
That will be it, buddy!
The matter will click!

712
01:14:27,128 --> 01:14:29,460
She'll go bonkers!
Assume, she is smitten, buddy!

713
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:33,667
She is smitten! To woo,
is beyond... your 'buddy'!

714
01:14:33,935 --> 01:14:39,237
Because it isn't as
easy as he thinks it is!

715
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:42,303
Understand, Mr. Whoever-You-Are!

716
01:14:47,548 --> 01:14:51,575
What do you think of yourself?
You ask others, how to woo me?

717
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:54,719
I didn't know that despite
studying at Oxford University...

718
01:14:55,056 --> 01:14:57,081
...your standards would be so low!

719
01:14:57,892 --> 01:15:00,383
Like an absolute
roadside vagrant! Good bye!

720
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:03,992
Pooja, where are you going?

721
01:15:05,366 --> 01:15:08,563
Why are you getting so angry?

722
01:15:08,903 --> 01:15:10,393
Rahul, get out of my way!

723
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:14,475
- Do you want to know?
- Yes, I do.

724
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:16,740
Before that, listen
to what I want to say.

725
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:21,638
Yes, I did ask my friend
how to win you because I...

726
01:15:23,751 --> 01:15:28,484
I love you. I am Oxford
University educated.

727
01:15:29,924 --> 01:15:32,552
But when it comes to love,
I am an absolutely illiterate!

728
01:15:33,027 --> 01:15:35,723
You are backward to quite
an extent, let alone love.

729
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:40,066
This isn't backwardness but
an openness of the heart!

730
01:15:40,902 --> 01:15:44,599
I had got many
proposals in London but...

731
01:15:45,773 --> 01:15:47,297
...you are different.

732
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:52,805
Now, you teach this
illiterate boy about love.

733
01:15:55,283 --> 01:15:58,741
And I spoke only with my friend;
I didn't make a noise about it!

734
01:16:00,421 --> 01:16:02,355
Will you meet my friend?
He drives a taxi.

735
01:16:02,857 --> 01:16:06,554
What to do now? I am...

736
01:16:22,577 --> 01:16:25,603
Hey, why are you staring like this?

737
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:28,774
It's me. Didn't you recognize me?

738
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:35,885
I do recognize!
But I cannot fathom, how a man...

739
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:38,454
...who was a taxi
driver until yesterday...

740
01:16:38,726 --> 01:16:40,626
...wears a suit,
jacket and boots today!

741
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:44,198
And the poor boy who
was a millionaire's son...

742
01:16:44,532 --> 01:16:46,261
...roams around as a taxi driver!

743
01:16:46,667 --> 01:16:50,398
I cannot fathom how the
tables have been turned!

744
01:16:51,172 --> 01:16:52,730
- Should I fall unconscious?
- Hey, no!

745
01:16:53,107 --> 01:16:56,076
It's all a matter of luck.
Who knows what will happen when?

746
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:57,140
Yes.

747
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:03,911
You just spoke about the stars.

748
01:17:04,285 --> 01:17:07,413
So I'm thinking when
had luck will befall me...

749
01:17:07,688 --> 01:17:11,146
...and the municipality
will break down my shop.

750
01:17:11,626 --> 01:17:15,255
So, I am going
around with a beforehand.

751
01:17:17,498 --> 01:17:20,626
Nothing will happen.
Don't worry.

752
01:17:21,035 --> 01:17:24,471
Just make us 2 'paan'
filled with tobacco.

753
01:17:27,141 --> 01:17:31,703
And make another 'paan'
filled with 'gulkhan'.

754
01:17:33,781 --> 01:17:36,147
Who eats that?

755
01:17:36,784 --> 01:17:40,845
Don't ask that. Just prepare it.

756
01:17:41,255 --> 01:17:42,153
Okay!

757
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:47,921
I've fallen in love at first sight.

758
01:17:55,136 --> 01:18:00,005
He is my friend Ra... Balu.
...She is Pooja.

759
01:18:01,976 --> 01:18:03,034
He is a very good friend of mine.

760
01:18:18,993 --> 01:18:21,518
- You had me frightened!
- Who is it, dear?

761
01:18:23,364 --> 01:18:24,729
It's only Murli, mother.

762
01:18:25,666 --> 01:18:28,829
I had asked me to bring tamarind
last Sunday. He hasn't yet got it.

763
01:18:31,839 --> 01:18:33,704
The pianist has sent a letter.

764
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:38,305
He has called you
to the beach at five.

765
01:19:14,882 --> 01:19:17,442
Murli, look how your sister
is trying to impress me.

766
01:19:31,899 --> 01:19:33,093
Hey Paro, where are you going?

767
01:24:27,781 --> 01:24:30,477
- Mr. Shastri, good-day.
- Greetings!

768
01:24:30,784 --> 01:24:33,753
- You look very happy today.
- I am very happy today...

769
01:24:34,221 --> 01:24:36,018
...because my daughter's
alliance has been fixed.

770
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:39,186
The boy is from an lyer
family and an engineer at PWD.

771
01:24:39,626 --> 01:24:43,255
He has his own house
and hails from a devout family.

772
01:24:44,131 --> 01:24:45,996
He visits the holy pilgrimage
in Tirupati every year.

773
01:24:46,199 --> 01:24:48,064
So it is as good
as fixed, isn't it?

774
01:24:50,771 --> 01:24:52,705
They will be coming the
day-after-tomorrow to see Paro.

775
01:24:52,973 --> 01:24:55,134
Heartiest congratulations.
Don't forget to invite me.

776
01:24:55,542 --> 01:24:56,736
Thank you. See you again.

777
01:24:58,078 --> 01:25:02,845
Mother, what's the hurry?
Let's wait for a few days more.

778
01:25:03,650 --> 01:25:08,246
Why, dear? You've completed your
B.A. You don't want to study further.

779
01:25:08,588 --> 01:25:10,579
I want to study.
I want to do my M. A.

780
01:25:11,424 --> 01:25:14,450
Enough of studying! All your
batch mates have got married.

781
01:25:14,995 --> 01:25:16,758
You too get married
and go to your place.

782
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:18,993
Don't say that, mother.
I am your daughter.

783
01:25:20,734 --> 01:25:25,262
That is your fault, Paro.
A daughter belongs to someone else.

784
01:25:26,439 --> 01:25:29,408
The home where she is born,
is not her own.

785
01:25:31,278 --> 01:25:34,304
Her home is where
her husband lives.

786
01:25:35,382 --> 01:25:36,644
You are a guest in
this house, dear.

787
01:25:38,685 --> 01:25:40,175
A guest who visits once in a while.

788
01:25:49,529 --> 01:25:51,588
- Sister.
- Where is Rahul?

789
01:27:46,379 --> 01:27:47,573
Paro, I'm very happy today.

790
01:27:50,116 --> 01:27:52,880
Do you know, my parents live here?
I came to meet them.

791
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,785
You also come and meet them.
They'll be very glad to meet you.

792
01:28:03,063 --> 01:28:04,052
What's wrong?

793
01:28:09,569 --> 01:28:11,867
- Who are you?
- I'll tell you everything.

794
01:28:12,405 --> 01:28:14,430
- First, come and meet them.
- No!

795
01:28:14,774 --> 01:28:18,642
Paro, you are insulting my parents.
Come on.

796
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:25,047
Where have you come from? What
do you want? What's your name?

797
01:28:29,622 --> 01:28:33,752
I am Rahul Mehta, the sole
heir to Mehta Industries.

798
01:28:35,562 --> 01:28:38,030
I am a Christian,
I live in London.

799
01:28:38,965 --> 01:28:43,129
My grandpa is a millionaire.
I have never lacked anything.

800
01:28:44,671 --> 01:28:47,731
My parents are dead.
They reside here nowadays.

801
01:28:48,842 --> 01:28:52,369
And I have come from London to
meet them. Any more questions?

802
01:28:57,417 --> 01:29:02,320
What did my love lack,
that you hid so much from me?

803
01:29:02,756 --> 01:29:06,749
Love? Some thing that gets shattered
in no time, isn't called love.

804
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:09,922
This is called love!
What my parents felt!

805
01:29:10,730 --> 01:29:13,927
They loved and trusted each other.

806
01:29:15,001 --> 01:29:17,663
They faced the troubles
of the world together.

807
01:29:18,204 --> 01:29:21,435
When they left this world,
they were together even then.

808
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:27,878
This is love. People hold it
as an exemplar even today.

809
01:29:28,815 --> 01:29:31,340
Your love?
I have seen your love!

810
01:29:32,285 --> 01:29:34,412
Your love was short - lived!

811
01:29:35,288 --> 01:29:38,519
What do you know, what love is?
Go! Go away from here!

812
01:29:39,993 --> 01:29:41,392
You cannot be my Rahul.

813
01:29:43,663 --> 01:29:45,893
- You cannot be my Rahul!

814
01:30:32,479 --> 01:30:33,878
Have you gone to sleep?

815
01:30:36,549 --> 01:30:39,609
I am not sleeping, Laxmi.
I am listening to music.

816
01:30:41,054 --> 01:30:44,785
- What Melodious music!
- Our Rahul play sit.

817
01:30:44,924 --> 01:30:48,553
I know it very well, Laxmi.

818
01:31:52,859 --> 01:31:54,884
Sister, Uncle Pianist
has sent a letter.

819
01:31:58,164 --> 01:32:00,155
How often have I asked
you not to go there?

820
01:32:16,149 --> 01:32:18,982
We are indeed very happy
to meet all of you.

821
01:32:19,619 --> 01:32:22,486
And we like your daughter a lot.

822
01:32:23,756 --> 01:32:28,420
- Do you cook, dear?
- She cooks everything... very well!

823
01:32:29,729 --> 01:32:31,993
- You too ask her.
- How much has she studied?

824
01:32:32,966 --> 01:32:34,490
She is B.A. Passed,
with first division!

825
01:32:36,336 --> 01:32:39,464
Let her also speak.
Is she mute?

826
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:43,801
No. She talks a lot.
But today, she is feeling shy.

827
01:32:44,677 --> 01:32:47,009
You said that she plays
the violin very well?

828
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:50,611
Yes. She plays the violin as well
as teaches the children here.

829
01:32:51,517 --> 01:32:54,077
Murli must be getting the violin.
Where the hell is he?

830
01:32:54,287 --> 01:32:55,413
Murli, bring the violin.

831
01:33:41,601 --> 01:33:44,365
What's the matter, dear?
At least, tell your mother.

832
01:33:53,046 --> 01:33:56,846
No, dear! What are you doing?
This cannot be!

833
01:34:18,671 --> 01:34:20,002
Sister has sent this.

834
01:39:57,610 --> 01:39:59,771
Due to the export order of
the Japanese Company...

835
01:40:00,046 --> 01:40:01,513
...Toshika Hara,
being cancelled...

836
01:40:01,781 --> 01:40:04,750
...this is the state of our 25
year old Mehta & Mehta Industries.

837
01:40:05,384 --> 01:40:09,013
Our company's chairman,
Mr. Shambunath Mehta...

838
01:40:09,488 --> 01:40:12,616
...has given us orders
to shut this unit.

839
01:40:12,992 --> 01:40:15,552
And to repay this company's
debt with the 200 million...

840
01:40:15,961 --> 01:40:17,826
...that we'll get by
selling this land.

841
01:40:18,164 --> 01:40:21,861
The court formalities are over.
Only one formality remains now.

842
01:40:22,568 --> 01:40:26,902
For Mr. Rahul Mehta to give his
consent by signing on this document.

843
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,177
Hey, sit down!

844
01:40:38,617 --> 01:40:45,955
Fantastic! He speaks very well!

845
01:40:48,527 --> 01:40:54,955
Just a minute! What a
speech he's written! Wow!

846
01:40:55,468 --> 01:40:57,800
Long live our revolution!

847
01:41:01,674 --> 01:41:03,904
Down with Mr. Mathur!

848
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:05,336
Mr. Mathur.

849
01:41:06,645 --> 01:41:09,341
- What's happening there?
- Nothing. He is a crazy worker...

850
01:41:09,615 --> 01:41:11,947
...of our company Dattabhau. He's
been on a hunger strike since 9 days.

851
01:41:12,918 --> 01:41:15,910
- He'll die!
- Forget it! It's a hunger strike.

852
01:41:16,589 --> 01:41:18,955
The police will come, beat them
and they'll come to their senses.

853
01:41:19,525 --> 01:41:21,152
- Come in.
- The man's been ***...

854
01:41:21,427 --> 01:41:24,919
...since 9 days. Over it, the cops
will beat him! You should be ashamed!

855
01:41:26,532 --> 01:41:29,092
Are you this company's
vice-chairman or... a butcher?!

856
01:41:29,935 --> 01:41:32,301
- Shame on you!
- Hey, where are you going?

857
01:41:33,205 --> 01:41:36,436
Long live our revolution!

858
01:41:36,876 --> 01:41:41,074
Hey, brothers! Will you
please lower your volume?

859
01:41:42,081 --> 01:41:44,413
- Hail Dattabhau!
- Hey, listen to me!

860
01:41:45,384 --> 01:41:47,147
- Long live our revolution!
- Hey, open the lock!

861
01:41:47,686 --> 01:41:49,051
- What can I do, sir?
- Open the lock!

862
01:41:50,456 --> 01:41:54,483
- Hold this!
- Don't go out! They are dangerous!

863
01:41:54,894 --> 01:41:59,957
- Long live our revolution!

864
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:03,766
Down with Mr. Mathur!

865
01:42:07,873 --> 01:42:11,604
- Just a minute!
- Fulfil our demands!

866
01:42:11,944 --> 01:42:13,707
My name is Rahul Mehta.
Who is Dattabhau?

867
01:42:14,213 --> 01:42:15,077
I'll show you.

868
01:42:18,951 --> 01:42:22,944
This a very dangerous situation
from the security point of view.

869
01:42:27,126 --> 01:42:28,957
Dattabhau, Mr. Rahul Mehta has come.

870
01:42:30,462 --> 01:42:31,759
I see! Rahul!

871
01:42:33,732 --> 01:42:37,964
Mr. Shambunath's daughter's son!
How are you, son?

872
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:40,995
I'm fine, but what's all this?

873
01:42:42,107 --> 01:42:45,270
You have not eaten since 9 days?!
At this rate, you will die!

874
01:42:46,212 --> 01:42:50,512
No problem.
Maybe, they will heed us then.

875
01:42:50,783 --> 01:42:54,048
The company is bankrupt.
For how long will they incur losses?

876
01:42:54,787 --> 01:42:56,516
These have never been
any losses, son.

877
01:42:57,590 --> 01:43:00,150
Mr. Mathur and his team
have always taken advantage.

878
01:43:00,860 --> 01:43:03,260
And have always kept
your grandpa in the dark.

879
01:43:04,864 --> 01:43:06,263
He was always kept in the dark!

880
01:43:07,166 --> 01:43:09,657
All of them kept
looting the company.

881
01:43:10,169 --> 01:43:13,070
And today, they are throwing it
in thrash like a sucked bone!

882
01:43:14,907 --> 01:43:19,310
Since the last 6 months, 2,000
laborers have been unemployed!

883
01:43:20,713 --> 01:43:22,704
And they are *** to death!

884
01:43:23,983 --> 01:43:26,645
They are selling this
land for 200 million.

885
01:43:26,986 --> 01:43:28,010
200 million?!

886
01:43:29,889 --> 01:43:33,086
This place must be worth at
least a billion rupees!

887
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:38,887
They will *** mess up even this
deal! Or what's the need to sell?

888
01:43:40,165 --> 01:43:42,633
Dattabhau, can the company
run on its own again?

889
01:43:43,035 --> 01:43:45,026
Why not? It can!

890
01:43:45,771 --> 01:43:48,001
But on a condition that the
management will be honest.

891
01:43:49,842 --> 01:43:52,538
Then, let's decide today itself.
Come with me!

892
01:43:54,513 --> 01:43:57,482
Hail Rahul Mehta!

893
01:43:57,716 --> 01:44:00,685
Hail Dattabhau!

894
01:44:16,602 --> 01:44:18,502
- Mr. Mathur, have the lock open!
- What are you saying?

895
01:44:18,804 --> 01:44:20,431
I am saying what you
don't want to listen.

896
01:44:21,006 --> 01:44:24,100
- This company will reopen.
- Impossible! It's been decided!

897
01:44:24,877 --> 01:44:27,971
- We've signed the document.
- It does not have my signature!

898
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:30,912
- Have the lock open.
- Do you know its outcome?

899
01:44:31,317 --> 01:44:35,151
- And the board of directors...
- Damn them! Get a hammer!

900
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:39,855
Mr. Mehta, what are you doing?

901
01:44:40,526 --> 01:44:44,826
You don't know what will happen.
You are making a mistake.

902
01:44:55,107 --> 01:45:02,172
- Hail Dattabhau!
- Hail Rahul Mehta!

903
01:45:15,494 --> 01:45:17,394
Balu, there's no problem
for the machinery.

904
01:45:17,796 --> 01:45:20,959
If you break this wall, then you'll
make place for it! It's done!

905
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:26,066
Careful. You'll get hurt.

906
01:45:27,539 --> 01:45:30,030
There will be no wall,
no partition.

907
01:45:30,642 --> 01:45:34,510
Break all of it!

908
01:46:06,945 --> 01:46:09,778
Had you thought about the poor...

909
01:46:10,449 --> 01:46:12,474
...then maybe, this company
would have progressed too!

910
01:46:44,216 --> 01:46:47,413
After today, there will be
no boss and no employee.

911
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:51,719
All of us will be equal shareholders
of this company's profits.

912
01:52:00,532 --> 01:52:03,467
Do you know who the girl is,
whom I love...

913
01:52:04,035 --> 01:52:05,696
...and am going to marry?

914
01:52:09,841 --> 01:52:17,213
- How do you know?
- Hey. O you think, I'm crazy?

915
01:52:17,816 --> 01:52:20,842
Hey, it is written
all over your face!

916
01:52:24,890 --> 01:52:25,720
Rascal!

917
01:52:26,858 --> 01:52:30,658
My blessings are with you.
Go to sleep.

918
01:52:33,465 --> 01:52:36,662
Brother has kept the room so untidy.
What will Rahul think?

919
01:52:38,069 --> 01:52:40,799
Murli, hold it properly.
Hey, hold it properly!

920
01:52:45,377 --> 01:52:46,503
Hey, I'm coming too!

921
01:53:12,137 --> 01:53:16,574
How could you dare to
touch a Brahmin girl?

922
01:53:18,877 --> 01:53:22,506
Hey, you tease a girl from our
colony! I'll teach you a lesson!

923
01:53:24,382 --> 01:53:29,251
Don't hit him!
Leave my Rahul!

924
01:53:30,422 --> 01:53:31,855
Leave him!

925
01:53:37,195 --> 01:53:41,131
- Somebody save my Rahul!
- Hey, leave him!

926
01:53:43,735 --> 01:53:46,932
If anyone even touches Rahul,
I'll break his hands and legs.

927
01:53:47,205 --> 01:53:49,673
- Balu, don't...
- Get lost! - Don't interfere!

928
01:53:51,176 --> 01:53:52,905
- What's happening?
- You are responsible for this, Shastri! *******

929
01:53:53,245 --> 01:53:56,078
You consider yourself a devout, and
have sins committed in your house?

930
01:53:57,549 --> 01:54:01,883
Guruji, the people here told me just
today that he is a Christian.

931
01:54:02,988 --> 01:54:06,287
And I have witnessed
both of them embrace!

932
01:54:06,791 --> 01:54:09,954
I've seen him visit the cemetery
for Catholics, many times.

933
01:54:10,495 --> 01:54:11,757
His parents graves are there!

934
01:54:12,364 --> 01:54:15,800
- You lied to me?
- He didn't, I did! And I made...

935
01:54:16,067 --> 01:54:18,001
...him wear the sacred thread
so that he could gain entry at home!

936
01:54:24,142 --> 01:54:26,167
You pretended to be Brahmin
despite being a Christian.

937
01:54:26,645 --> 01:54:29,045
You deceived us by
wearing the sacred thread!

938
01:54:29,381 --> 01:54:30,712
- Beat him so much that...
- Quiet!

939
01:54:31,216 --> 01:54:33,776
If any man steps ahead,
I swear, I'll kill him!

940
01:54:34,052 --> 01:54:38,614
He gave you a petty job,
and you have become his slave?

941
01:54:39,024 --> 01:54:41,515
Didn't you think
anything about your sister?

942
01:54:41,826 --> 01:54:45,193
I speak with the right of a brother!
And she has to marry somebody.

943
01:54:45,964 --> 01:54:48,262
So, what does he lack?
Why is Rahul bad?

944
01:54:49,167 --> 01:54:52,159
So what if he is a Christian?
Had I been so orthodox like you...

945
01:54:52,437 --> 01:54:54,769
...then I'd have been starving to
death! And what have you given me?

946
01:54:55,907 --> 01:55:00,469
No, Balu! Stop it!

947
01:55:01,246 --> 01:55:08,015
They want to beat me? You want
to beat me? Please go ahead!

948
01:55:10,188 --> 01:55:14,352
Why have you stopped? Beat me! Yes,
it's true, that I'm a Christian.

949
01:55:14,893 --> 01:55:19,023
But it's also true that we love
each other and want to get married!

950
01:55:20,699 --> 01:55:23,099
If you yet want to beat me,
then do go ahead!

951
01:55:25,403 --> 01:55:28,566
But hear Paro say the truth
once, that she loves...

952
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:31,035
...and wants to
get married to me.

953
01:55:32,377 --> 01:55:35,938
If this is my crime, then
beat me! Please kill me!

954
01:55:38,249 --> 01:55:41,047
Paro, speak!
Tell them what the truth is.

955
01:55:43,021 --> 01:55:46,889
Please tell them!
Please speak Paro!

956
01:55:51,596 --> 01:55:52,460
Tell them!

957
01:56:00,171 --> 01:56:04,699
Yes, I love Rahul!
I love him very much!

958
01:56:08,313 --> 01:56:09,712
But...

959
01:56:14,319 --> 01:56:16,787
I love my father also very much.

960
01:56:20,258 --> 01:56:24,251
This marriage will take
place only with his consent!

961
01:56:55,326 --> 01:56:58,295
Are you happy now, dear?

962
01:56:59,497 --> 01:57:01,988
You have made your
father bow his head!

963
01:57:04,169 --> 01:57:08,333
My Balu took away half of my life.

964
01:57:09,841 --> 01:57:11,900
Why did you do this, huh?

965
01:58:12,637 --> 01:58:14,867
Do you know that you are
the chief of the Brahmin's society?

966
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:18,409
Its very foundation could shake
with this decision of yours!

967
01:58:21,279 --> 01:58:22,303
Foundation?

968
01:58:23,314 --> 01:58:24,679
Which foundation?

969
01:58:26,084 --> 01:58:29,178
The foundation of
this house has broken.

970
01:58:30,555 --> 01:58:33,046
And you talk about
the foundation of the society?

971
01:58:34,826 --> 01:58:40,093
My Balu - I threw
him out of the house.

972
01:58:42,066 --> 01:58:46,765
He drives a taxi.
He could have become an engineer.

973
01:58:47,806 --> 01:58:53,711
I did not do anything
for my children! Nothing!

974
01:59:52,971 --> 01:59:55,599
If you wish, then this
marriage can take place but...

975
01:59:56,574 --> 01:59:58,701
...only after
the boy is consecrated.

976
02:00:00,044 --> 02:00:04,640
- Yes, he will do everything.
- You don't interfere.

977
02:00:08,019 --> 02:00:12,456
- Rahul, did you hear?
- Yes, I did. I accept it.

978
02:00:15,860 --> 02:00:19,023
The ritual of consecration
will be very difficult and long.

979
02:00:21,299 --> 02:00:22,630
I accept everything.

980
02:00:23,368 --> 02:00:26,599
The engagement will take
place a week before the wedding.

981
02:00:28,039 --> 02:00:30,803
The decision to marry,
cannot be changed after that.

982
02:00:31,876 --> 02:00:35,835
During this period, the girl
and the boy cannot see each other.

983
02:00:36,848 --> 02:00:38,042
Do you accept?

984
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:43,214
Yes, I do.

985
02:00:44,188 --> 02:00:46,952
Fine! With God's blessings and
under the auspices of the stars...

986
02:00:47,358 --> 02:00:52,762
...and planets, I fix the wedding
for the 10th of the next month.

987
02:00:56,601 --> 02:00:57,932
Sister, leave me!

988
02:01:03,508 --> 02:01:07,569
- Wow! It's done!
- Hey, what's the matter?

989
02:01:08,413 --> 02:01:11,576
- You appear very happy today.
- It's something to be happy about.

990
02:01:12,350 --> 02:01:13,715
Firstly, you are not angry with me.

991
02:01:14,085 --> 02:01:18,385
Secondly, my sister's
wedding has been fixed!

992
02:01:19,123 --> 02:01:21,353
- Sister?
- And that too, with a...

993
02:01:21,793 --> 02:01:23,260
...very good friend of mine.

994
02:01:23,761 --> 02:01:27,356
Hey, but you had said
that you have no siblings.

995
02:01:27,799 --> 02:01:30,495
And that, you are all alone. Where
did a sister come from suddenly?

996
02:01:31,703 --> 02:01:34,866
I am alone.
But I look upon her as my sister.

997
02:01:35,273 --> 02:01:40,973
- I see!
- Hey, how are you? Real cool, huh!

998
02:01:41,279 --> 02:01:43,406
Hey, what are you doing?
Sit properly.

999
02:01:44,349 --> 02:01:47,546
Do you know who sit this way?
The taxi drivers here.

1000
02:01:47,952 --> 02:01:50,318
Me, a taxi driver? Rubbish!

1001
02:01:51,522 --> 02:01:55,219
But hats off to your
observation! What... Wow!

1002
02:01:55,560 --> 02:02:01,226
- Let's have a 'paan' to that!
- 'Paan'? - Eat and see!

1003
02:02:04,969 --> 02:02:05,993
Hey Balu?

1004
02:02:14,512 --> 02:02:15,444
How are you?

1005
02:02:16,914 --> 02:02:19,610
Hey, you stare again!

1006
02:02:21,085 --> 02:02:23,212
Hey, your eyes will
fall off into the 'paan'.

1007
02:02:25,423 --> 02:02:29,985
Look here. My, my!
Isn't she very beautiful?

1008
02:02:30,862 --> 02:02:32,386
Do you know who she is?

1009
02:02:33,598 --> 02:02:36,328
She your daughter-in-law!

1010
02:02:41,939 --> 02:02:45,966
- How is she?
- Very lovely! Absolutely lovely!

1011
02:02:46,344 --> 02:02:50,303
A suit, a tie and boots,
in the first round!

1012
02:02:50,581 --> 02:02:52,412
In the second, a bride and a car!

1013
02:02:52,750 --> 02:02:56,413
And in the third round,
there will be a lovely baby!

1014
02:03:01,893 --> 02:03:04,225
Now, that depends on her!

1015
02:03:05,663 --> 02:03:08,325
- What do you think, darling?
- About what?

1016
02:03:08,966 --> 02:03:10,934
About what he is saying.

1017
02:03:12,303 --> 02:03:15,466
Hey, try and understand!

1018
02:03:16,974 --> 02:03:18,100
Hey, where are you going?

1019
02:03:18,643 --> 02:03:21,806
- Hey listen!
- What's wrong?

1020
02:08:37,395 --> 02:08:39,659
Mrs. Patel, this is Rahul
speaking from Mumbai. How are you?

1021
02:08:40,398 --> 02:08:43,367
- How is grandpa?
- Oh Rahul? Everything's fine.

1022
02:08:45,469 --> 02:08:48,996
Hey, I am going to get
married on the 10th next week.

1023
02:08:49,907 --> 02:08:52,467
I've called four times.
Why hasn't anyone informed grandpa?

1024
02:08:53,677 --> 02:08:55,269
Please do inform grandpa.

1025
02:09:05,990 --> 02:09:08,959
Rahul is so highly educated.
Why does he drive a taxi?

1026
02:09:09,627 --> 02:09:13,188
There's an advertisement
published for a good job.

1027
02:09:13,798 --> 02:09:16,062
The interview will be held
tomorrow. Ask him to go.

1028
02:09:17,268 --> 02:09:19,065
I'll go and meet the men
preparing the podium.

1029
02:09:19,870 --> 02:09:22,270
- Have you heard what I said?
- Yes, I have.

1030
02:09:27,445 --> 02:09:29,970
Hey, don't go in front of
him! It will be sacrilegious!

1031
02:09:30,648 --> 02:09:31,637
I won't.

1032
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:05,104
Greetings! How are you?

1033
02:10:07,117 --> 02:10:08,141
How are your parents?

1034
02:10:10,154 --> 02:10:11,382
Won't you come in?

1035
02:10:13,858 --> 02:10:17,760
Won't you come in front of me?
Don't you desire to meet me?

1036
02:10:20,898 --> 02:10:21,990
Do you think of me?

1037
02:10:24,101 --> 02:10:25,090
How often?

1038
02:10:27,071 --> 02:10:30,404
Enough. Now tell me,
What brings you here?

1039
02:10:39,683 --> 02:10:43,084
Father...
I am going for my interview.

1040
02:11:25,896 --> 02:11:27,329
Where have you
brought me, Ramsingh?

1041
02:11:31,435 --> 02:11:35,269
Hey Paro, take care of the
children! Or else, throw them out!

1042
02:11:45,215 --> 02:11:49,117
How could you let Rahul
stay in such a deplorable colony?

1043
02:11:50,754 --> 02:11:54,815
It stinks everywhere.
Mirchandani, which house is it?

1044
02:11:55,726 --> 02:12:00,095
I'll inquire, Sir...
Which his Mr. Shasti's house?

1045
02:12:00,531 --> 02:12:02,260
- That vagrant, Balu's father?
- Yes.

1046
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:04,261
Take a right, then a left.
It's the first house.

1047
02:12:04,835 --> 02:12:06,200
First right, then left.
Please come, Sir.

1048
02:12:06,971 --> 02:12:10,304
What an awful place
you've brought me to!

1049
02:12:11,909 --> 02:12:15,606
Wow, what an auspicious day!

1050
02:12:17,014 --> 02:12:20,074
I say, there cannot be
a better day than the tenth.

1051
02:12:21,018 --> 02:12:23,350
The stars favor this marriage.

1052
02:12:24,054 --> 02:12:28,923
If they get married in this period,
they'll lead a happy married life.

1053
02:12:42,973 --> 02:12:44,406
Who, amongst you,
is P.V.K. Shastri?

1054
02:12:46,010 --> 02:12:47,409
I am. What is the matter?

1055
02:12:49,246 --> 02:12:52,215
- He is Mr. Shambunath Mehta.
- London's eminent businessman.

1056
02:12:52,716 --> 02:12:53,740
So what am I to do?

1057
02:12:55,019 --> 02:12:59,251
- Rahul is my daughter's son.
- What! You are Rahul's grandpa?

1058
02:12:59,890 --> 02:13:01,255
Where is Rahul?

1059
02:13:02,192 --> 02:13:04,922
I'll take rent from you if you
stay in my room after marriage.

1060
02:13:05,396 --> 02:13:06,954
- Rascal!
- That I am. - The retinue is here.

1061
02:13:07,431 --> 02:13:09,490
Your grandpa has come from London.

1062
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:11,893
- Where is he?
- At Balu's place. - Let's go.

1063
02:13:13,003 --> 02:13:16,962
I'm sorry, I didn't know
that you Rahul's grandpa sit.

1064
02:13:17,374 --> 02:13:20,468
- I have not come here to sit.
- Rahul must be on his way.

1065
02:13:21,045 --> 02:13:23,570
He is getting married to my
daughter the day-after-tomorrow.

1066
02:13:25,816 --> 02:13:29,912
- Grandpa! You?
- Are you displeased to see me?

1067
02:13:30,354 --> 02:13:33,482
What are you saying!
I knew, you would surely come.

1068
02:13:34,324 --> 02:13:37,054
I have not come here
to attend the wedding.

1069
02:13:38,228 --> 02:13:40,822
I have come here to
take you back to London.

1070
02:13:41,465 --> 02:13:42,727
Most of the arrangements are done.

1071
02:13:43,167 --> 02:13:50,505
Fine! Arvind, pay Mr. Shastri
for all the losses he has incurred.

1072
02:13:53,844 --> 02:13:56,244
I knew, this is precisely
what you would do.

1073
02:13:58,382 --> 02:14:01,249
After all, you are the son
of that father who was born...

1074
02:14:01,485 --> 02:14:02,577
...in this filth!

1075
02:14:02,853 --> 02:14:06,516
Grandpa, for God's sake,
do not speak ill about my parents.

1076
02:14:07,891 --> 02:14:10,451
Your mother was my daughter too.

1077
02:14:11,562 --> 02:14:13,120
There is no need
to talk too much here.

1078
02:14:15,833 --> 02:14:19,701
Mr. Shastri, this is for the loss
and the trouble you undertook.

1079
02:14:20,337 --> 02:14:21,429
Keep it.

1080
02:14:22,339 --> 02:14:26,867
You have no right to insult
anyone. Apologize to him.

1081
02:14:27,244 --> 02:14:29,337
You are not in
your senses right now.

1082
02:14:30,581 --> 02:14:32,549
The infamy I had to
endure because of you...

1083
02:14:32,950 --> 02:14:36,386
...is enough to last a lifetime.

1084
02:14:38,756 --> 02:14:41,452
Ramsingh, tell him that
all of us will be returning...

1085
02:14:41,692 --> 02:14:42,818
...by tomorrow's flight.

1086
02:14:53,036 --> 02:14:54,594
- Rahul dear...
- Uncle Ramu.

1087
02:15:03,747 --> 02:15:06,614
You have greatly
deceived me, Ramsingh.

1088
02:15:07,918 --> 02:15:15,882
Despite being an old, loyalist
of mine, you kept me in the dark.

1089
02:15:17,194 --> 02:15:19,185
Didn't you find anyone
else other than Rahul...

1090
02:15:19,463 --> 02:15:21,124
...to send, to that
deplorable colony?

1091
02:15:22,299 --> 02:15:24,199
You forgot your standing!

1092
02:15:24,935 --> 02:15:31,272
This** has proved, he is the
son of that father...

1093
02:15:32,442 --> 02:15:35,468
...whose life began from a dirty
slum and ended there too.

1094
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:40,675
That's enough, Mr. Shambunath.
You may tell me anything.

1095
02:15:41,485 --> 02:15:46,422
But I won't tolerate even a word
spoken against my Rahul.

1096
02:15:47,124 --> 02:15:52,221
- You are not his father, Ramsingh!
- I know, I'm not his father.

1097
02:15:55,232 --> 02:15:57,427
But I have nurtured him
for 19 years.

1098
02:15:57,768 --> 02:16:01,568
Thanks for that!
But you have done no favor.

1099
02:16:02,339 --> 02:16:04,364
You were paid for this,
every month.

1100
02:16:05,075 --> 02:16:08,340
Wow! Wow, Shambunath!

1101
02:16:09,913 --> 02:16:16,250
You, eventually, did weigh years
of loyalty with money!

1102
02:16:17,321 --> 02:16:18,811
Driver, stop the car.

1103
02:16:23,694 --> 02:16:26,162
Shambunath, your
daughter left you.

1104
02:16:27,097 --> 02:16:30,362
Don't lose your son now, or you
will be left all alone.

1105
02:16:31,201 --> 02:16:32,691
Driver, start the car.

1106
02:17:00,097 --> 02:17:02,964
- Who are you? What you want?
- Quietly come with us!

1107
02:17:03,433 --> 02:17:05,526
Or I'll shoot you!
Come on!

1108
02:17:10,941 --> 02:17:12,203
Mr. Shambunath!

1109
02:17:35,599 --> 02:17:39,000
Mathus... what is all this?

1110
02:17:39,703 --> 02:17:42,399
We have to do this sometimes.
What do I do?

1111
02:17:42,940 --> 02:17:45,636
If we had amicably asked you to
transfer all the factories...

1112
02:17:45,909 --> 02:17:48,275
...of Mumbai, in our
names, would you have done so?

1113
02:17:49,112 --> 02:17:50,875
No, right? Therefore, we
kidnapped you.

1114
02:17:51,381 --> 02:17:55,750
Mathus, you have
always been foolish.

1115
02:17:56,253 --> 02:17:59,222
Your petty mind is
working over-time.

1116
02:18:00,324 --> 02:18:02,724
And you are committing a
folly again.

1117
02:18:03,293 --> 02:18:06,524
Mr. Mehta, Mr. Mathus has not been
so audacious, I have.

1118
02:18:07,464 --> 02:18:11,764
And I am not foolish.
Kante is my name.

1119
02:18:12,569 --> 02:18:17,472
Now, quietly sign it. Anyway, I'm
not fond of kids and old people.

1120
02:18:18,275 --> 02:18:21,472
I will. But it is futile.

1121
02:18:22,045 --> 02:18:25,708
Before coming to India, I had
transferred all my properties...

1122
02:18:26,016 --> 02:18:28,746
...businesses and bank
accounts in Rahul's name.

1123
02:18:31,254 --> 02:18:34,087
I told you, I am not foolish.

1124
02:18:34,891 --> 02:18:37,689
I have arranged for this too...
Call Rahul.

1125
02:18:42,699 --> 02:18:46,795
Look, I'm Rahul speaking...
His grandson Rahul Mehta.

1126
02:18:48,905 --> 02:18:51,430
Ask him to telephone me
as soon as he gets back.

1127
02:18:56,013 --> 02:18:58,777
Let's eat, son.
Balu will not come.

1128
02:18:59,750 --> 02:19:00,910
I think, Balu has come.

1129
02:19:06,189 --> 02:19:08,919
- Uncle Ramu!
- Grandpa has been kidnapped!

1130
02:19:09,526 --> 02:19:10,891
- What are you saying?
- The truth, son.

1131
02:19:12,262 --> 02:19:16,164
- It has to be his doing.
- Come with me.

1132
02:19:16,466 --> 02:19:17,330
Let's go.

1133
02:19:27,210 --> 02:19:29,269
- Is Mr. Mathus there?
- No. Brother is not here!

1134
02:19:30,580 --> 02:19:32,172
Swine! Tell me where my
grandpa is!

1135
02:19:41,458 --> 02:19:42,948
Hey, Rahul! He'll die!

1136
02:19:49,366 --> 02:19:51,095
At least ask him where
grandpa is.

1137
02:19:51,935 --> 02:19:54,768
His face reveals that this is his
doing! Answer, swine!

1138
02:19:55,439 --> 02:19:56,963
Tell me, where is grandpa?
Answer!

1139
02:19:57,541 --> 02:19:59,008
I told you, he is not Rahul.

1140
02:19:59,409 --> 02:20:02,503
Have you ever called me, your own
since childhood? Never!

1141
02:20:03,814 --> 02:20:06,009
Your lust to earn money made
you so crazy...

1142
02:20:06,516 --> 02:20:09,280
...that you never knew when
the ones your own, went away from you!

1143
02:20:09,753 --> 02:20:13,154
I do not want your wealth,
your luxuries! I don't!

1144
02:20:13,590 --> 02:20:19,085
Look! Despite death being so
close to you, you fail to understand!

1145
02:20:20,030 --> 02:20:21,520
You refuse to accept your Rahul?

1146
02:20:21,832 --> 02:20:23,527
What difference does my
signature make?

1147
02:20:24,668 --> 02:20:27,967
I was an orphan, I am
and will remain one!

1148
02:20:28,472 --> 02:20:32,806
Hey, resolve your family disputes
outside! Quietly sign now!

1149
02:20:33,443 --> 02:20:36,241
First, go and get the sign of the
man who wrote this on my hand!

1150
02:20:37,214 --> 02:20:40,513
Hey, where has it gone? Whose
signature did you want?

1151
02:20:42,352 --> 02:20:46,448
Oh, mine? You unnecessarily
wasted my time... Crazy man!

1152
02:21:02,038 --> 02:21:02,902
Let's go, grandpa.

1153
02:21:14,251 --> 02:21:17,550
Mathur's and Kante's men have
kidnapped grandpa.

1154
02:21:18,355 --> 02:21:21,847
Where are you now? I need your
help. Why aren't you talking?

1155
02:21:26,563 --> 02:21:28,963
You deceived Kante!
Tie the scoundrels!

1156
02:21:29,799 --> 02:21:33,428
- Who asked you to act smart?
- We had escaped.

1157
02:21:34,004 --> 02:21:36,598
Your name is Balu, huh?
You are Rahul's friend.

1158
02:21:37,240 --> 02:21:39,265
Now telephone him and call him.

1159
02:21:40,110 --> 02:21:44,604
Hey, I am Rahul's friend! I'll
die but won't call him! Get lost!

1160
02:21:44,948 --> 02:21:47,781
Hey you! The value of your
life has fallen down.

1161
02:21:48,552 --> 02:21:52,511
Quickly telephone Rahul or I'll
decrease the life span of your grandpa!

1162
02:21:53,156 --> 02:21:54,851
Hey Kante, you are a big fool!

1163
02:21:55,492 --> 02:21:59,053
He made his grandson's life, a hell.

1164
02:21:59,396 --> 02:22:00,920
He never loved him.

1165
02:22:01,264 --> 02:22:03,027
Is Rahul an ass, to risk his life...

1166
02:22:03,333 --> 02:22:04,823
...and save this stone-hearted man?

1167
02:22:05,335 --> 02:22:07,530
I am telling you, he will not come.

1168
02:22:08,038 --> 02:22:11,064
Do one thing. Rack your petty mind
and think of a new plan.

1169
02:22:11,408 --> 02:22:15,811
Then telephone me. We'll talk.
I'll leave now.

1170
02:22:16,580 --> 02:22:20,209
Stop your theatrics, or I shall
end your grandpa's life!

1171
02:22:20,750 --> 02:22:21,842
Telephone Rahul!

1172
02:22:23,086 --> 02:22:25,987
Quickly telephone him, or the
next bullet will come out...

1173
02:22:26,323 --> 02:22:27,881
...from your grandpa's brains!

1174
02:22:33,630 --> 02:22:35,655
Rahul, where are you now?

1175
02:22:48,778 --> 02:22:51,542
- No! Spare me!
- Spare him. He's my father-in-law!

1176
02:22:52,349 --> 02:22:53,247
Even I am!

1177
02:23:19,009 --> 02:23:19,998
Rahul, run!

1178
02:23:42,565 --> 02:23:45,659
Swine! You dared to touch
my grandpa!

1179
02:23:50,840 --> 02:23:57,473
Grandpa, forgive me. I behaved
impertinently with you.

1180
02:23:59,783 --> 02:24:05,688
For a while, I felt that I had
lost you forever, son.

1181
02:24:06,222 --> 02:24:08,554
No, grandpa. I'll take you to
the hospital.

1182
02:24:09,559 --> 02:24:12,050
No, I do not want to
go to the hospital.

1183
02:24:12,929 --> 02:24:15,523
I want to first attend my
grandson's wedding.

1184
02:24:16,433 --> 02:24:20,529
- First, come to the hospital.
- I said, I don't want to!

1185
02:24:22,305 --> 02:24:23,465
You are very stubborn.

1186
02:24:24,974 --> 02:24:30,344
You are right. Just like you.

1187
02:24:32,716 --> 02:24:34,911
Balu, come here.

1188
02:24:35,885 --> 02:24:39,412
- Balu.
- Yes?

1189
02:24:41,191 --> 02:24:47,323
Tell him that he is the cane
now of this lame man.

1190
02:24:48,898 --> 02:24:52,925
He can take me wherever he wants.
Let's go.

1191
02:25:14,591 --> 02:25:17,958
Mr. Shashi, now get Balu
also married quickly.

1192
02:25:18,561 --> 02:25:19,892
Who will marry him, Mr. Mehta?

1193
02:25:36,146 --> 02:25:38,205
- What's this?
- Marriage. - Marriage?

1194
02:25:48,525 --> 02:25:50,755
It is said that the
movement of stars...

1195
02:25:51,661 --> 02:25:53,754
...make or break a
person's life.

1196
02:25:55,298 --> 02:26:01,237
Someday, when a star up here taken a
left... I'm sorry, a right turn...

1197
02:26:02,405 --> 02:26:03,929
...then in the earth below...
