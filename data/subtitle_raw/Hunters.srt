00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,127
<i>Civilization wouldn't
end with nuclear fire.</i>

3
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:31,164
<i>It'd be tattered and torn
by the likes of disease.</i>

4
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>One that could mutate rapidly.</i>

5
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:36,804
<i>The greatest minds in the
world couldn't understand it.</i>

6
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:38,706
<i>And therefore, it took over.</i>

7
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:40,742
<i>Chaos followed.</i>

8
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,045
<i>But the disease
just didn't stop at death, no.</i>

9
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,517
<i>Those who survived it became
something entirely different.</i>

10
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,320
<i>Aggressive,
almost indestructible.</i>

11
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:57,057
<i>Cannibalistic. Mutants.</i>

12
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,795
<i>We began to call them hunters.</i>

13
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,465
<i>Every once in a while,
I find something out in the wild.</i>

14
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:44,606
<i>Something unexpected, useful.</i>

15
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,409
<i>Sometimes I even find things
that remind me of a time</i>

16
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,713
<i>that was a hell of a lot
better than right now.</i>

17
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:02,356
<i>Sometimes I wonder,</i>

18
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,493
<i>you know, bringing something
back to the camp</i>

19
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,896
<i>is better than nothing, right?</i>

20
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,636
<i>It's definitely better than
not returning at all.</i>

21
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:11,926
<i>Days are long
and the terrain is tough,</i>

22
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,730
<i>but it keeps the monsters
at bay for now.</i>

23
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,373
<i>This is John Wrecker,</i>

24
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:03,978
<i>Trace Operative, Station 222.</i>

25
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,749
<i>The world we knew is gone.</i>

26
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:13,487
<i>Pacifica has become a land
of death and despair.</i>

27
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,400
<i>Every day, we fight to
survive this new nightmare,</i>

28
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,903
<i>to survive each other.</i>

29
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,043
<i>Dangerous creatures
now roam the island,</i>

30
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,680
<i>born out of the apocalypse.</i>

31
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:47,688
<i>They hunt us
from station to station.</i>

32
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,661
<i>And I do the same to them.</i>

33
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:12,046
<i>They're evolving,
becoming more dangerous.</i>

34
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:18,853
<i>And therefore, so must I.</i>

35
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:54,622
<i>When I'm out here by myself,</i>

36
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,095
<i>I start understanding
these creatures more and more.</i>

37
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:05,633
<i>I start noticing patterns.</i>

38
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:16,544
<i>I start realizing
their tendencies.</i>

39
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:19,847
<i>They're starting to become
more predictable.</i>

40
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,526
<i>My biggest fear, though,
is that I am too.</i>

41
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,868
<i>Sleep is a luxury.</i>

42
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,472
<i>But I know
I'm gonna grind it out.</i>

43
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,108
<i>I think of my father</i>

44
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,110
<i>and my father always wanted me
in those corners,</i>

45
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,477
<i>grinding it out.</i>

46
00:07:58,713 --> 00:07:59,880
<i>I'm just praying to
whatever gods are up there</i>

47
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:04,218
<i>that maybe let the hope
shine in a bit first.</i>

48
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,275
Hey, John.
Didn't see you come in.

49
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:59,413
No, I don't suppose
you did there, Lewis, did ya?

50
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:02,850
You get one?

51
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:06,621
Yes, sir.

52
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:09,256
I found
their little feeding area,

53
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:12,092
just outside of
that point right there.

54
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,831
What'd it take
to bring her down?

55
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:18,866
A little too much C-4.

56
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:23,337
Anything left of 'em?

57
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:32,880
Got the usual bits and pieces.

58
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:34,381
Copy that.

59
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,787
Did you hear any chatter
on the wire lately?

60
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,457
Yeah, 221.

61
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:47,762
They had a couple of refugees
come down with a fever.

62
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:49,797
A lot of them didn't make it.

63
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,200
Shame.

64
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,908
John, that looks pretty rough.

65
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,779
Go get changed. Go see Grace.

66
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:05,913
She'll bandage you up.

67
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:08,516
Yeah.

68
00:19:10,952 --> 00:19:12,285
Going out again soon?

69
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:16,289
Yeah, in the morning.

70
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:19,292
Anything I can get for you?

71
00:19:19,961 --> 00:19:21,428
Besides a bit of shuteye?

72
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:32,172
I need more grenades.

73
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,375
Copy that.
We're running pretty low.

74
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,345
Well then I guess I'll have to
use them sparingly.

75
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:43,818
And some more C-4, please.

76
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:46,420
Oh, John, John, hang on.

77
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:47,454
I almost forgot.

78
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:54,394
Got you all fixed up.

79
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,464
Replaced the Lithium reactor,

80
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,867
managed to weld some of
the plates back together,

81
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,202
and we fixed the comm unit.

82
00:20:02,937 --> 00:20:04,404
Should be pretty good to go now.

83
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:18,385
No worries.

84
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:21,488
Should give you
a tactical advantage.

85
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,627
Let's hope so.

86
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:31,966
<i>All these people, my people.</i>

87
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,670
<i>I walk by,
they're huddled in the camp.</i>

88
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:37,337
<i>They're looking for warmth.</i>

89
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,740
<i>They're looking for food.</i>

90
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:40,641
<i>They're looking for supplies.</i>

91
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:45,880
<i>Anything that can help them
get by each day,</i>

92
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,248
<i>each hour, each minute.</i>

93
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:12,339
John.

94
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:14,675
Sergeant Wrecker.

95
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:19,781
Ah, the war,
it's been over for years.

96
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:23,785
I'm pretty sure
we could lose the formalities.

97
00:21:28,523 --> 00:21:29,824
If you say so.

98
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:31,559
What can I do for you?

99
00:21:33,995 --> 00:21:37,932
Lewis thought that I might need
a bit of a seeing to on...

100
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:42,670
Take a seat in my chair.

101
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:43,738
Thank you.

102
00:21:48,576 --> 00:21:50,812
Not too deep.
Let me grab some gauze.

103
00:21:51,546 --> 00:21:52,680
Was it a scab?

104
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:53,748
No.

105
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:55,983
Was it close?

106
00:21:58,619 --> 00:21:59,620
Close enough.

107
00:22:01,956 --> 00:22:05,458
You know, John,
their cells aren't like ours.

108
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:10,463
What?

109
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,002
The scabs, their cells,

110
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:17,939
after the infection takes over,

111
00:22:17,972 --> 00:22:19,472
it mutates the cells.

112
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:25,880
You're telling me these
creatures don't feel any pain?

113
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:27,447
That's correct.

114
00:22:28,883 --> 00:22:30,551
It starts on the frontal lobe
of the brain.

115
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:32,053
- What do you mean?
- The brain starts

116
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,420
to disintegrate.

117
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:35,890
I've done a lot of research,
uh, motor skills,

118
00:22:35,923 --> 00:22:37,692
judgment, social skills,

119
00:22:37,725 --> 00:22:38,726
they're all shot.

120
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:40,595
Yeah, but these things they...

121
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:42,362
they communicate
with each other.

122
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:44,131
Yes, they do.

123
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:45,733
- And?
- The cells mutate.

124
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,368
Bone density, it grows slightly.

125
00:22:49,604 --> 00:22:50,605
Then the heart,

126
00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:53,040
it goes to a crawl.

127
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,146
After several days
of rapid mutation,

128
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,781
that's when the lights go on.

129
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:03,150
Rapid movement agitates them.

130
00:23:03,918 --> 00:23:06,921
Motor function
now increases dramatically.

131
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:08,623
As does hunger.

132
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:11,759
Yeah. Um...

133
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:15,863
What am I telling you
all this for?

134
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:18,065
You already know it already.

135
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,535
I guess it's just a lot...

136
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:26,674
it's a lot better hearing it
from somebody like you.

137
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:32,513
I do imagine a lot, by the way.

138
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:35,516
What do you imagine?

139
00:23:38,753 --> 00:23:40,621
Oh.

140
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:45,693
Uh, I... I know you're going
back out on patrol again soon.

141
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:48,696
So get some rest.

142
00:23:48,963 --> 00:23:49,964
Get some food in ya.

143
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,701
And be safe.

144
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:59,807
I just found this incredible,
uh, reading material

145
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,841
when I was...

146
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:09,717
and, uh... it's new words. Uh...

147
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:15,523
It is a base... it's baseball.

148
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:17,091
- Baseball?
- Mm-hmm.

149
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:18,125
I love baseball.

150
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:20,628
I remember baseball.

151
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:29,704
I'm gonna, ah...

152
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:32,740
Oh, I...

153
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,781
Okay.

154
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:41,983
I got some tests to do.

155
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:44,151
Right. I'll...

156
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:47,888
Okay.

157
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,769
I'm not looking
to mess up anybody's day.

158
00:28:24,438 --> 00:28:25,439
All right?

159
00:28:29,343 --> 00:28:30,945
Hey, guys.

160
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:36,317
I'm not looking for any trouble.
Put the guns down.

161
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:44,391
Bastard!

162
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:14,221
Don't waste the ammo.

163
00:31:33,427 --> 00:31:35,563
<i>John? John?</i>

164
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:38,365
<i>John? John? John? John?
John? John?</i>

165
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,634
John? John?

166
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,402
Wake up. Wake up, John.

167
00:31:43,705 --> 00:31:45,339
- What's going on?
- We need you.

168
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,042
Yeah.

169
00:31:51,111 --> 00:31:52,112
Okay.

170
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,589
Hey guys.

171
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:04,024
Go ahead, Lewis.

172
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:05,192
Tell him what you heard.

173
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:09,229
Scanning through the channels
like I always do.

174
00:32:10,464 --> 00:32:13,434
And I came across
this communication.

175
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:16,069
Could barely make it out,
and I...

176
00:32:16,504 --> 00:32:19,440
You know, it's just
better if I play it for you.

177
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:30,951
<i>I repeat, we're under attack!</i>

178
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:36,089
<i>Something, scabs,
they're here!</i>

179
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:40,194
<i>They must have followed a
scouting party back to our camp.</i>

180
00:32:42,095 --> 00:32:44,632
<i>If there are any trace operatives
in the immediate vicinity,</i>

181
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:47,100
<i>we need help!</i>

182
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:58,245
Did you try
getting back to these guys?

183
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:00,981
John, I've tried every channel.

184
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:03,150
Every open line
of communication.

185
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:04,752
I've just got static.

186
00:33:09,122 --> 00:33:10,123
Breakwater Creek.

187
00:33:11,793 --> 00:33:14,361
Breakwater Creek. Why do
I know Breakwater Creek?

188
00:33:15,362 --> 00:33:18,098
Isn't that... isn't that
the old fifth well station?

189
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:21,168
We used to trade plants
and spring water

190
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:22,704
with them a while back.

191
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,071
Okay.

192
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:33,413
Okay.

193
00:33:35,148 --> 00:33:36,149
John.

194
00:33:40,287 --> 00:33:41,689
What, you don't want
me going out now?

195
00:33:42,557 --> 00:33:45,058
I just don't understand
why another operative can't go.

196
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:49,162
'Cause I'm pretty sure
we don't have any around.

197
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:21,542
John to Lewis.

198
00:42:22,843 --> 00:42:23,878
John to Lewis.

199
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:27,081
Lewis? John, do you read me?

200
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:34,555
Lock the bunker down.
No one leaves.

201
00:42:36,157 --> 00:42:37,892
I'm on my way back.
Lewis, do you read?

202
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:44,131
Lewis, I'm staring at
a trace map right now.

203
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,969
And if these things didn't know
where we lived before,

204
00:42:50,304 --> 00:42:51,939
they sure as hell do right now.

205
00:42:59,313 --> 00:43:01,682
I'm on my way back. Over.

206
00:48:26,373 --> 00:48:27,374
What's this?

207
00:48:30,444 --> 00:48:31,445
Hi, John.

208
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:38,285
It looks like a bladed weapon
of some sort.

209
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,921
A bladed weapon of some sort?

210
00:48:43,323 --> 00:48:44,324
Are you kidding me?

211
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:49,564
I've never seen anything
handcrafted like that before

212
00:48:50,063 --> 00:48:52,266
in all my tracing days.

213
00:48:53,568 --> 00:48:54,602
Where'd you...
where'd you find it?

214
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:56,538
Are you kidding me?

215
00:48:57,438 --> 00:48:59,406
Ye... yeah, where'd you find it?

216
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,578
Where did I find...? I found that
at a marauder camp.

217
00:49:04,178 --> 00:49:06,581
These scabs are
making their own weapons.

218
00:49:06,614 --> 00:49:10,618
They're crafting
their own fucking weapons.

219
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:13,721
I haven't heard any chatter
on the radio about this.

220
00:49:13,755 --> 00:49:15,723
I haven't heard anything
from any other camps.

221
00:49:15,757 --> 00:49:18,693
That's your job.
That's exactly what you should be doing.

222
00:49:18,726 --> 00:49:19,727
You should be on the radio.

223
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:22,463
You should know these things.
I'm going out there.

224
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:24,699
I'm naked. I have no idea.

225
00:49:24,732 --> 00:49:27,334
And yet these scabs
are out there now creating,

226
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:29,737
crafting their own weaponry.

227
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:31,271
You're supposed to be
on top of this!

228
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:33,608
I'm going out there.
I'm risking my life.

229
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:36,310
I'm risking the lives of
everybody here in this bunker.

230
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:38,646
And that's what I gotta
go out and find?

231
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:40,748
What are you worried about
bladed weapons for?

232
00:49:40,782 --> 00:49:44,619
You got guns and explosives
and all sorts of technology.

233
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:47,187
They're making it on their own!

234
00:49:47,221 --> 00:49:49,456
I mean, how do you know it was
the scabs and not the marauders?

235
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,992
You said it yourself,
you found it in a marauder camp.

236
00:49:54,662 --> 00:49:56,296
I don't know.

237
00:49:58,131 --> 00:50:01,034
I'm going out there.
This is your job.

238
00:50:01,201 --> 00:50:02,637
You need to be on that thing.

239
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,606
That is what you do.

240
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:06,139
That is what you do.

241
00:50:07,074 --> 00:50:08,610
I mean, there has been
some chatter on the radio

242
00:50:08,643 --> 00:50:11,411
of some refugees gone missing
past couple of weeks.

243
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,215
I mean, that...
that does seem to connect,

244
00:50:15,249 --> 00:50:16,416
to make a little bit of sense.

245
00:50:17,484 --> 00:50:20,020
Lewis, goddammit,
they're handcrafting weaponry!

246
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:23,390
They're evolving!
Can you imagine if they get their hands

247
00:50:23,423 --> 00:50:25,760
on guns and explosives?

248
00:50:26,694 --> 00:50:28,028
- Jesus.
- No.

249
00:50:29,531 --> 00:50:30,665
No.

250
00:50:30,698 --> 00:50:33,467
This, you, me,
everything we're doing,

251
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,602
the whole bunker,

252
00:50:34,636 --> 00:50:36,671
done and dusted.

253
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:41,108
I... this bunker is done!

254
00:50:41,141 --> 00:50:43,443
These lives that
we're trying to protect

255
00:50:43,811 --> 00:50:44,612
are for naught!

256
00:50:46,614 --> 00:50:47,849
John, how long
have you been out there?

257
00:50:47,882 --> 00:50:49,182
Three days!

258
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:52,720
John, you look like shit.

259
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,354
You need some rest.

260
00:50:54,722 --> 00:50:56,524
You're no good to us dead.

261
00:51:03,798 --> 00:51:05,198
You do your job, John.

262
00:51:06,734 --> 00:51:07,735
Protect us.

263
00:57:31,018 --> 00:57:32,620
You wear the colors.

264
00:57:35,723 --> 00:57:36,991
You wear the armor.

265
00:57:37,959 --> 00:57:39,193
You must know the words.

266
00:57:40,261 --> 00:57:41,562
Convince me you're not a thief

267
00:57:41,595 --> 00:57:43,731
who just stole
some soldier's uniform.

268
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:45,900
I'm John T Wrecker.

269
00:57:46,968 --> 00:57:50,470
Identification number 00324.

270
00:57:51,272 --> 00:57:52,673
This is my quadrant.

271
00:57:53,874 --> 00:57:54,875
This is my sector.

272
00:57:58,179 --> 00:58:00,480
I trained
in the Anchorage facility.

273
00:58:03,617 --> 00:58:05,252
I trained
in the Anchorage facility.

274
00:58:05,286 --> 00:58:08,723
John T Wrecker. 00324.

275
00:58:08,756 --> 00:58:11,258
This is my quadrant.
This is my sector.

276
00:58:13,761 --> 00:58:15,262
And how long
you been hunting for?

277
00:58:18,165 --> 00:58:19,400
I don't know.

278
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:31,712
None of us do.

279
00:58:34,015 --> 00:58:35,916
You don't wanna go in there.

280
01:00:50,284 --> 01:00:51,719
Well there's problems
to the north,

281
01:00:51,752 --> 01:00:52,920
as I'm sure you've heard.

282
01:00:58,025 --> 01:00:59,026
Thanks.

283
01:01:01,328 --> 01:01:02,329
Yeah, I've heard.

284
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:06,133
A lot of missing people.

285
01:01:11,939 --> 01:01:13,440
Is that what brings you
around this way?

286
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:18,112
Yeah, for the most part.

287
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:24,318
Plus there's been shortages
of ammunition

288
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,352
for quite some time.

289
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:30,791
Pretty sure that's been
a problem for us,

290
01:01:31,225 --> 01:01:36,130
for everyone, everywhere,
for quite some time.

291
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:43,103
So what's your situation
down in this sector?

292
01:01:46,941 --> 01:01:48,209
I'm starting to notice
the scabs are fewer

293
01:01:48,242 --> 01:01:49,143
and farther between.

294
01:01:52,846 --> 01:01:54,715
Well, that's different
from my experiences.

295
01:01:55,249 --> 01:01:57,184
- Pardon?
- Scabs, I've...

296
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:00,888
I've seen them migrate
a little bit more.

297
01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:03,057
Migrate?

298
01:02:04,391 --> 01:02:06,360
- Like a herd?
- Something like that.

299
01:02:09,997 --> 01:02:11,031
That makes sense.

300
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:14,134
Go on.

301
01:02:17,838 --> 01:02:19,873
There's something new out there,
from what I gather.

302
01:02:21,008 --> 01:02:22,209
Yeah, there's been
a few instances

303
01:02:22,243 --> 01:02:24,345
where I've run into
some survivors who...

304
01:02:25,479 --> 01:02:26,981
who've been to camps
with missing people

305
01:02:27,014 --> 01:02:28,749
and in the way those camps
have been...

306
01:02:30,552 --> 01:02:31,885
attacked is...

307
01:02:33,887 --> 01:02:35,055
It's different.

308
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:39,126
Yeah. I'm starting
to notice that too.

309
01:02:41,028 --> 01:02:42,029
How do you mean?

310
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:44,532
I'm checking out these camps

311
01:02:45,432 --> 01:02:47,268
and there are no bodies
to be found.

312
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:55,009
There's no way that one of
these creatures, these monsters,

313
01:02:55,909 --> 01:02:57,512
whatever you wanna call it,
these scabs,

314
01:02:57,545 --> 01:03:00,314
there's no way that
they can do that by themselves.

315
01:03:01,549 --> 01:03:04,451
These things
are next to invincible.

316
01:03:06,186 --> 01:03:07,522
You can barely kill 'em.

317
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:10,491
And now I'm starting
to think they're not

318
01:03:10,858 --> 01:03:11,925
working alone anymore.

319
01:03:15,195 --> 01:03:17,532
And I'm thinking if we can get
a group of people together,

320
01:03:17,565 --> 01:03:19,066
prepare them properly,

321
01:03:20,602 --> 01:03:22,570
that we can all work together
and we can take them out.

322
01:03:22,604 --> 01:03:24,204
- No.
- Yes.

323
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:25,806
We need your help.

324
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:27,975
I need your help.

325
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:29,943
No.

326
01:03:29,977 --> 01:03:31,312
- Yes.
- No.

327
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:34,582
Why not? We need help.
We need to work together.

328
01:03:34,616 --> 01:03:37,251
We have to bring everybody,
side-by-side

329
01:03:37,284 --> 01:03:39,820
and start picking them off
like they're picking us off.

330
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:43,190
- It could work. Yes.
- No.

331
01:03:43,223 --> 01:03:45,025
- Why not?
- Because.

332
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:46,927
- Because what?
- Because you know.

333
01:03:47,629 --> 01:03:50,598
You know we're depleted,
you know we have no ammunitions.

334
01:03:50,632 --> 01:03:53,033
Why do you think
I'm walking around here?

335
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:54,902
I lost my entire camp.

336
01:03:59,373 --> 01:04:01,909
And you think that
you can just kill all these?

337
01:04:03,243 --> 01:04:05,112
With what? What do you have?

338
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:08,516
Three clips?
How many clips do you have?

339
01:04:09,249 --> 01:04:10,217
- How many clips?
- Three.

340
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:11,519
- You have three clips?
- I have three clips.

341
01:04:11,553 --> 01:04:13,521
You have three clips.

342
01:04:15,255 --> 01:04:16,624
They've told you.

343
01:04:16,658 --> 01:04:18,225
We've ran out of soldiers.

344
01:04:18,258 --> 01:04:21,261
We have no supplies.
We have no ammunitions.

345
01:04:21,663 --> 01:04:23,163
What do you expect?

346
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:24,865
I'm expecting to do something.

347
01:04:26,934 --> 01:04:27,901
It's not gonna wor...

348
01:04:27,935 --> 01:04:29,370
I'm not gonna sit around here
and just die.

349
01:04:29,403 --> 01:04:31,205
Well, it's not gonna work. Okay?

350
01:04:31,238 --> 01:04:33,374
So do me a favor,
pack your shit,

351
01:04:33,407 --> 01:04:35,876
and when I come back, be gone.
Understand?

352
01:04:44,017 --> 01:04:45,252
Yeah, I understand.

353
01:04:55,028 --> 01:04:57,231
<i>John.
I was just about to call you.</i>

354
01:04:58,165 --> 01:05:00,000
I'm just happy
to be counted, sir.

355
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:02,503
It's easy to think
you've been forgotten

356
01:05:03,303 --> 01:05:07,040
when you're left out here in
this pretty piece of the world.

357
01:05:09,042 --> 01:05:10,678
<i>Oh, no. Quite the contrary.</i>

358
01:05:10,712 --> 01:05:12,146
<i>There's a lot of activity
going on</i>

359
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:13,447
<i>in your neck of the woods.</i>

360
01:05:17,151 --> 01:05:19,319
I just received
a video transmission

361
01:05:19,721 --> 01:05:21,488
that was sent over six days ago.

362
01:05:22,456 --> 01:05:24,324
<i>Yes. 227.</i>

363
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:26,594
And what's the status
on that, General?

364
01:05:27,428 --> 01:05:30,364
<i>Yeah, they've been dark
for over 24 hours.</i>

365
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,033
They've been dark?

366
01:05:33,434 --> 01:05:35,302
<i>We can assume
they've been overrun.</i>

367
01:05:36,771 --> 01:05:38,338
<i>Give me a sit rep, John.</i>

368
01:05:39,072 --> 01:05:41,074
<i>What's the climate like
over in your quadrant?</i>

369
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,612
Pretty typical
until a few days ago.

370
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:51,018
Some scavenging scabs,
poaching refugees, marauders.

371
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:53,721
I tracked them.
I took care of it.

372
01:05:55,055 --> 01:05:56,023
And then you know what happened?

373
01:05:57,391 --> 01:05:59,460
<i>And then you saw
this new breed, huh?</i>

374
01:05:59,493 --> 01:06:01,629
Yeah, I did.

375
01:06:03,263 --> 01:06:05,199
<i>Scabs have always been tough.</i>

376
01:06:05,232 --> 01:06:07,468
<i>Their biological makeup
stresses their cells</i>

377
01:06:07,501 --> 01:06:09,203
<i>and nerve endings,
but we've always known</i>

378
01:06:09,236 --> 01:06:11,004
<i>and dealt with the fact
that they're hard to kill,</i>

379
01:06:11,371 --> 01:06:16,076
<i>but this new breed
is much more... trying.</i>

380
01:06:18,613 --> 01:06:21,749
How many trace operatives
have we lost recently, sir?

381
01:06:22,684 --> 01:06:24,351
<i>Look, John,
you know as well as I do</i>

382
01:06:24,384 --> 01:06:26,320
<i>that our numbers
are dwindling.</i>

383
01:06:26,353 --> 01:06:28,590
<i>Especially since the Red Road
rose up back east</i>

384
01:06:28,623 --> 01:06:31,124
<i>and started their own
personal war over territory.</i>

385
01:06:31,391 --> 01:06:32,760
<i>They've actually conquered
quite a bit</i>

386
01:06:32,794 --> 01:06:35,362
<i>but we can't fight two wars
at once.</i>

387
01:06:35,797 --> 01:06:38,999
Sir, how many?

388
01:06:40,133 --> 01:06:41,502
<i>I've got 16 operatives left</i>

389
01:06:41,536 --> 01:06:43,237
<i>on the entire
western seaboard.</i>

390
01:06:47,241 --> 01:06:50,612
<i>These new scabs,
they've been watching us,</i>

391
01:06:50,645 --> 01:06:52,145
<i>waiting, it would appear.</i>

392
01:06:53,681 --> 01:06:55,182
<i>Still primitive
in their fashion</i>

393
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:56,584
<i>of using bladed weaponry,</i>

394
01:06:56,618 --> 01:07:00,287
<i>but they're communicating,
coordinating attacks.</i>

395
01:07:02,422 --> 01:07:05,560
<i>They've killed over 50
operatives in the last 10 days.</i>

396
01:07:07,094 --> 01:07:08,663
<i>Who knows how many refugees?</i>

397
01:07:08,696 --> 01:07:11,031
<i>Hundreds,
maybe even a thousand.</i>

398
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,169
Well, I have reason to believe we
have two of those scabs out here,

399
01:07:17,437 --> 01:07:20,508
and I'm fairly certain
that they know

400
01:07:20,542 --> 01:07:22,075
where our bunker is located.

401
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,515
<i>Then they'll come
for you, John.</i>

402
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:30,050
<i>What's your inventory like?</i>

403
01:07:33,555 --> 01:07:35,823
Low. Yeah.

404
01:07:37,324 --> 01:07:38,158
Always low.

405
01:07:40,193 --> 01:07:42,496
Although I'm sure
I could fashion together

406
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:43,598
whatever we needed.

407
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:48,368
Do a quick MacGyver
if necessary.

408
01:07:49,604 --> 01:07:51,305
Everything else
is peachy though.

409
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,375
<i>We've been working on
something in the lab.</i>

410
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:58,178
<i>Desperate times call for
desperate measures, right?</i>

411
01:07:58,211 --> 01:08:00,213
<i>I may have something
that could work.</i>

412
01:08:00,715 --> 01:08:02,449
<i>Can you get to an airdrop
if I can manage</i>

413
01:08:02,482 --> 01:08:04,418
<i>to get something to you
within a few miles?</i>

414
01:08:07,555 --> 01:08:09,591
I think anything would help
at this point, sir.

415
01:08:11,726 --> 01:08:13,093
<i>Okay.</i>

416
01:08:14,394 --> 01:08:15,730
<i>I've got one available helo
with enough extra fuel</i>

417
01:08:15,763 --> 01:08:17,331
<i>for a slight detour.</i>

418
01:08:18,633 --> 01:08:20,100
<i>I'll send you the coordinates
through the telecom.</i>

419
01:08:21,368 --> 01:08:22,269
<i>Hell, I'll even throw in
something from the old war</i>

420
01:08:22,436 --> 01:08:23,437
<i>that might help.</i>

421
01:08:24,204 --> 01:08:25,640
I appreciate it.

422
01:08:27,374 --> 01:08:29,209
<i>You'll know
what to do with it.</i>

423
01:08:29,242 --> 01:08:31,579
<i>But John, only take a dose</i>

424
01:08:31,613 --> 01:08:33,480
<i>if you know
you're in for a battle.</i>

425
01:08:34,348 --> 01:08:35,516
<i>You understand
what I'm saying?</i>

426
01:08:36,951 --> 01:08:38,151
Yes, sir.

427
01:08:39,419 --> 01:08:40,688
<i>Look, I can't make
any promises about this stuff,</i>

428
01:08:41,956 --> 01:08:43,357
<i>but it works, then luck's
gonna be on our side.</i>

429
01:08:46,561 --> 01:08:47,595
<i>Good luck, soldier.</i>

430
01:16:53,848 --> 01:16:56,117
<i>After receiving the care
package from General Taylor,</i>

431
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:57,284
<i>I headed back to camp.</i>

432
01:16:58,686 --> 01:17:00,888
<i>It was refreshing fighting
something more human than not,</i>

433
01:17:01,422 --> 01:17:04,692
<i>but nothing about it felt...
human.</i>

434
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,962
<i>Killing to be able to kill.</i>

435
01:17:09,598 --> 01:17:13,067
<i>I know Grace or... or Lewis would
have something to say about it,</i>

436
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:17,271
<i>but if they asked me
right now what I thought,</i>

437
01:17:17,304 --> 01:17:19,006
<i>I'd tell 'em
straight to their faces</i>

438
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:22,009
<i>that I'm glad
it's in our hands now.</i>

439
01:17:22,042 --> 01:17:23,844
<i>Wrecker,
can you hear me? Come in.</i>

440
01:17:24,278 --> 01:17:26,180
<i>Listen, I don't know
if you can talk</i>

441
01:17:27,181 --> 01:17:28,349
<i>but you got to
understand something.</i>

442
01:17:28,382 --> 01:17:29,717
<i>Grace went out
looking for you.</i>

443
01:17:30,184 --> 01:17:31,285
<i>She hasn't come back.</i>

444
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:33,787
<i>I think she's gone missing.</i>

445
01:19:43,384 --> 01:19:44,653
<i>Hello, John.</i>

446
01:19:44,686 --> 01:19:47,087
<i>I was just given some
information about your post.</i>

447
01:19:47,855 --> 01:19:50,324
<i>Lewis, he's a good soldier.</i>

448
01:19:53,193 --> 01:19:54,529
<i>Anyway, he's a good asset.</i>

449
01:19:58,566 --> 01:20:00,000
<i>Did you get the package?</i>

450
01:20:10,277 --> 01:20:12,179
<i>Everyone is a soldier
at this point.</i>

451
01:20:12,212 --> 01:20:13,914
<i>We're fighting
a losing battle.</i>

452
01:20:15,049 --> 01:20:17,552
<i>And I need to know
if what I gave you works.</i>

453
01:20:18,452 --> 01:20:19,820
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

454
01:20:21,623 --> 01:20:24,458
<i>You've always been one of the
best soldiers in my arsenal.</i>

455
01:20:30,164 --> 01:20:33,033
<i>Humanity needs every man
and woman we can muster.</i>

456
01:20:33,467 --> 01:20:34,468
<i>You understand me?</i>

457
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:11,205
I see you had no problem
finding me again.

458
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,945
What is it? What's wrong?

459
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:24,619
I lost something today.

460
01:21:28,989 --> 01:21:30,457
Well, I guess that's something
you're just going

461
01:21:30,491 --> 01:21:31,559
to have to get used to.

462
01:21:43,036 --> 01:21:44,037
Shit.

463
01:21:47,575 --> 01:21:49,309
It was August, or I...

464
01:21:50,645 --> 01:21:52,312
think it was,
I have no fucking clue.

465
01:21:54,415 --> 01:21:56,417
There were two men
in my quadrant.

466
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:58,118
We lost Miller a few months ago.

467
01:22:00,187 --> 01:22:02,423
Son of a bitch didn't even die
by one of those scumbags,

468
01:22:02,456 --> 01:22:04,425
he had pneumonia,
if you can believe that shit.

469
01:22:07,428 --> 01:22:09,129
Anyway, I was outpost
for a couple of days

470
01:22:09,163 --> 01:22:13,267
and when I got back...
camp was destroyed.

471
01:22:17,104 --> 01:22:19,473
No bodies, no bones.

472
01:22:22,276 --> 01:22:24,211
Just the smell of death
and evidence of slaughter.

473
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,184
Did you go out
and look for anyone?

474
01:22:31,185 --> 01:22:32,587
What difference would that make?

475
01:22:34,321 --> 01:22:35,322
I know they were dead.

476
01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:38,425
Being eaten
off somewhere in the dark.

477
01:22:39,761 --> 01:22:40,961
I failed my mission.

478
01:22:44,198 --> 01:22:45,733
This is
a different type of Hunter.

479
01:22:49,169 --> 01:22:50,572
All right?
They're still animalistic but...

480
01:22:52,105 --> 01:22:53,641
they're starting to remember
that they're human.

481
01:22:55,643 --> 01:22:57,211
They're starting to remember
the English language.

482
01:22:57,244 --> 01:22:59,046
And I'm not talking about
grunts or scribbles.

483
01:22:59,079 --> 01:23:01,549
I'm talking about they're
starting to learn how to write.

484
01:23:02,617 --> 01:23:05,486
Yeah. And I've seen that too.

485
01:23:06,521 --> 01:23:08,288
More than one
is just impossible.

486
01:23:09,757 --> 01:23:10,758
It's impossible.

487
01:23:13,661 --> 01:23:15,229
That's why I have one of these.

488
01:23:18,198 --> 01:23:20,000
'Cause you need
one hell of a punch.

489
01:23:24,404 --> 01:23:25,740
The doctors
wanted a sample of them.

490
01:23:25,773 --> 01:23:27,509
They just don't have
the resources anymore.

491
01:23:27,542 --> 01:23:30,778
So now it's just every man,
woman, and child

492
01:23:30,812 --> 01:23:32,246
fending for themselves.

493
01:23:37,351 --> 01:23:39,554
Some reason I think God
just fucking hates us.

494
01:23:44,559 --> 01:23:45,693
Well, I need your help.

495
01:23:47,829 --> 01:23:49,531
No one else has the training.

496
01:23:49,564 --> 01:23:51,498
No one else knows
how to use the firepower.

497
01:23:51,533 --> 01:23:55,570
Plus maybe...
you and your death wish

498
01:23:56,871 --> 01:23:58,105
wouldn't hurt us.

499
01:24:02,577 --> 01:24:04,512
Now is a chance for you
to redeem yourself.

500
01:24:05,713 --> 01:24:07,114
Whether you want to or not,

501
01:24:07,147 --> 01:24:09,316
you have an obligation
to the oath,

502
01:24:10,183 --> 01:24:12,587
to the people
that you swore to protect,

503
01:24:14,187 --> 01:24:17,424
to get big where others hide
and they get small.

504
01:24:19,259 --> 01:24:21,563
You wear those colors
because you honor those

505
01:24:21,596 --> 01:24:22,730
who came before you.

506
01:24:24,364 --> 01:24:27,702
Honor them by fighting
in their memory,

507
01:24:27,735 --> 01:24:30,237
fighting for the ones
that you swore to protect.

508
01:24:33,273 --> 01:24:34,576
I'm going back to my post.

509
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,613
And if you feel like
completing your mission,

510
01:24:40,314 --> 01:24:41,749
you know where to find me.

511
01:27:45,533 --> 01:27:46,768
<i>You still recording?</i>

512
01:27:46,801 --> 01:27:48,669
<i>Commander is gonna wanna see
these things in CQC.</i>

513
01:27:48,703 --> 01:27:50,337
<i>Keep it rolling, Wrecker.</i>

514
01:29:33,507 --> 01:29:34,909
A limb for a limb.

515
01:31:21,716 --> 01:31:26,921
<i>This is John Wrecker,
Trace Operative, Station 222.</i>

516
01:31:28,756 --> 01:31:29,790
<i>We have disbanded</i>

517
01:31:31,525 --> 01:31:35,763
<i>and I've sent what little survivors
we had left to another outpost.</i>

518
01:31:36,230 --> 01:31:41,102
<i>One where hopefully
they can find safety.</i>

519
01:31:41,902 --> 01:31:43,771
<i>On the orders
of General Taylor,</i>

520
01:31:44,772 --> 01:31:45,740
<i>I was given a serum</i>

521
01:31:47,675 --> 01:31:49,510
<i>and I wanna confirm
that it worked.</i>

522
01:31:50,311 --> 01:31:54,949
<i>No pain and a surge of
adrenaline overtakes the body.</i>

523
01:31:55,816 --> 01:31:59,787
<i>It is my hope and
my belief that this serum</i>

524
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:03,190
<i>will put us on a level playing
field with those scabs.</i>

525
01:32:05,026 --> 01:32:08,029
<i>I've killed two of 'em,
this new breed,</i>

526
01:32:08,929 --> 01:32:11,065
<i>but I am certain that
there are more out there.</i>

527
01:32:12,066 --> 01:32:14,935
<i>I no longer consider
this outpost my home.</i>

528
01:32:15,936 --> 01:32:18,839
<i>And I believe that
I've found a new purpose,</i>

529
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:20,941
<i>a new mission,</i>

530
01:32:22,109 --> 01:32:24,545
<i>not to protect just one place
in particular,</i>

531
01:32:26,647 --> 01:32:30,684
<i>but to roam Pacifica
and wage new war</i>

532
01:32:31,152 --> 01:32:32,787
<i>on this new breed of hunter.</i>

533
01:32:33,888 --> 01:32:37,024
<i>This is John T Wrecker
signing off.</i>
