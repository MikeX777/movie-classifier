1
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,578
Grand Hotel. Grand Hotel.

2
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,891
The time is 01:35 am.

3
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,564
Yes, this is the night operator.

4
00:01:03,337 --> 00:01:04,695
I'll give you the night clerk.

5
00:01:06,112 --> 00:01:07,413
Hello? Night clerk speaking.

6
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:08,885
Alright. Yes.

7
00:01:09,657 --> 00:01:11,558
Has Mr Mark Stone arrived?
- Not yet.

8
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:14,090
Miss Hallie Hobart in?
- She's not in, Mr Thorne.

9
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:16,981
Did you ring her?
- Yes. But she's not in, Mr Thorne.

10
00:01:17,254 --> 00:01:17,840
Ah.

11
00:01:18,388 --> 00:01:20,147
These salesmen won't
take no for an answer.

12
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:21,850
I'll give her a buzz.

13
00:01:22,393 --> 00:01:23,838
Room 417, please.

14
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:30,187
How many times?
Miss Hobart is out. O-U-T.

15
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:33,031
That's just what I wanted to
know, girlie. How are you all?

16
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:35,110
Say, you're not allowed in here.
- No?

17
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:38,874
Well I've never seen your
face but I know your voice.

18
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:41,302
Charlie Thorne of the
Bellside Harvester Company.

19
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:44,052
I just blew in tonight.
- Yes, you were here last year.

20
00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:46,452
Sure. Where's Hallie Hobart?

21
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:49,407
Well, if you don't tell anybody.
She's out on business.

22
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:51,350
You know Mr Kent Carr, don't you?

23
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:54,265
Sure. Kent Carr of the
Carr Harvester Company.

24
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:55,828
What's she doing out with him?

25
00:01:56,197 --> 00:01:58,243
They're out with some customers.
You know, farmers.

26
00:01:59,182 --> 00:02:01,878
Selling machinery.
Hallie is helping me put the deal over.

27
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:04,725
Hallie makes a lot of money that
way. You know, percentage.

28
00:02:05,348 --> 00:02:08,167
Say, is Mr Mark Stone
one of the rustics?

29
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:09,855
Who?
- Mark Stone.

30
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:11,000
No.

31
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,555
She still works in the barber shop?
- Yes, she's still manicuring.

32
00:02:15,055 --> 00:02:16,276
Trimming them good, eh?

33
00:02:16,473 --> 00:02:18,466
She must have a lot of
money in the old sock now.

34
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:20,758
Plenty. She's a smart girl.

35
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:22,944
Hello?

36
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:24,511
She's out.

37
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:27,414
That's young McConnell again.
He's drunk.

38
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:30,660
He's waiting for Hallie too.
- McConnell the packer's son?

39
00:02:31,073 --> 00:02:34,103
He wanted to marry her, didn't he?
- Sure, and he still does.

40
00:02:34,574 --> 00:02:36,743
He's got plenty of Jack.
- That he has.

41
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:40,044
You know, last year when Hallie
was away on her vacation.

42
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:44,011
He had her room all fixed
up by an interior decorator.

43
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:45,774
Have you seen it?
- No.

44
00:02:46,055 --> 00:02:47,871
Does that mean he's
got the run of the place?

45
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:51,069
No. He doesn't get to
first base with Hallie.

46
00:02:51,724 --> 00:02:53,493
She's smart, Hallie is.
- Right.

47
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:56,916
Hello?

48
00:02:57,637 --> 00:02:58,366
Alright.

49
00:03:01,324 --> 00:03:03,625
Hello? Ice water in 620.

50
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,370
He's the drunkest thing.

51
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:08,118
You must get quite an
earful on this board, baby.

52
00:03:08,373 --> 00:03:09,703
Plenty. I could write a book.

53
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:11,788
Would you like to leave
a message for Hallie?

54
00:03:11,985 --> 00:03:15,127
No, I'll hang around. I've got to
see her. I want to talk business.

55
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:17,854
Why don't you wait up in her room: 417?

56
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:21,095
I'll have Mike let you in.
You can give him a quarter.

57
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:23,565
You know, young McConnell is
waiting down there in the lobby.

58
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:25,206
That's a great idea.

59
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,189
You have what's called a brain, baby.

60
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:28,444
Grand Hotel.

61
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:31,133
I said you've got what
they call a brain.

62
00:03:31,497 --> 00:03:33,528
Grand Hotel.
- Well, let it go.

63
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:37,709
Mike. On the phone.

64
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:39,848
Have you a reservation, sir?

65
00:03:40,112 --> 00:03:41,306
Yes, the name is Stone.

66
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:44,028
Yes. There's a reservation
here for a Mr Mark Stone.

67
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,084
I'm David. That's my brother.
He's not coming.

68
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:50,698
David Stone. 418.
- Yes, sir.

69
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:52,584
Right this way.

70
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:54,206
Goodnight, sir.
- Goodnight.

71
00:03:55,014 --> 00:03:56,978
Gee, I wish had half that
young fellow's money.

72
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:59,843
He might like to have half of
anybody's money. Who is he?

73
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:02,645
The son of Ezra Stone, the richest
wheat farmer in the state.

74
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,587
Looks as if he hadn't change for a dime.

75
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:06,286
Just good old farm stock.

76
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,017
Hallie Hobart in yet? Give her a buzz.

77
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:14,995
I told you, Mr McConnell. She's not in.

78
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:17,657
Give her another buzz anyhow.
I had a date with her. Go on.

79
00:04:17,905 --> 00:04:19,974
Hey. Why not run along home, buddy.

80
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:21,595
The lady isn't in.

81
00:04:22,183 --> 00:04:23,398
You know what time it is?

82
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:24,933
A quarter to two.

83
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:27,344
Who wants to know?

84
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:29,727
I'm the house officer and
you're making too much noise.

85
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,857
I did, eh? I don't like detectives.

86
00:04:32,193 --> 00:04:33,294
They're a snoopy lot.

87
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:36,295
Now look here young fellow. We don't
want any trouble here. Go on, get out.

88
00:04:37,517 --> 00:04:39,100
It's terrible. I'm going to bed.

89
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:41,303
Leave them to me.
I'll get rid of them alright.

90
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:43,971
Just .. just a minute.

91
00:04:44,191 --> 00:04:46,923
You must say goodnight to the lady now
because we're going home to go to bed.

92
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:48,721
Goodnight, Mr Olsen.

93
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:51,171
Say goodnight to the lady.
We're going home to go to bed.

94
00:04:51,368 --> 00:04:53,721
Goodnight, Mr France. We had
a perfectly charming time.

95
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:55,365
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

96
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,197
I kiss your hand, madame.

97
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:04,143
Let me help you up.

98
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:13,372
Everything is fine.
Now, I'll see you in the morning.

99
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:16,287
Don't forget.
- Yes.

100
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:19,752
Mike .. get him out of here.

101
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:24,356
I've got a date with you, Hallie.
- Yes, I know. I know.

102
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,006
What's the idea?

103
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:29,648
I've got a date with Hallie.

104
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:31,480
Who?

105
00:05:31,677 --> 00:05:33,965
Charlie Thorne of the Bellside
Harvester Company.

106
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:35,635
Yes, I know Charlie Thorne, but ..

107
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,605
He said it was Business.

108
00:05:37,802 --> 00:05:39,346
Business? At this hour of the night?

109
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:41,312
It was alright to let him in, wasn't it?

110
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:44,228
No, Mike. You know better than to
let a man in my room at this hour.

111
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,429
Miss Hallie. I'm sorry.

112
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,746
Sure, I wouldn't do anything wrong.
- You wouldn't, would you.

113
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:51,193
Stupid Irishman.

114
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,594
Ah bless your little heart.

115
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:56,079
Stupid man.

116
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:00,517
Hello Charlie.
- Hello.

117
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:03,205
How are you, little fellah?

118
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:05,774
Say, how did you get in here?
You've got a nerve.

119
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:07,993
I busted in to talk business to you.

120
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,267
Business? Oh, no.

121
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:12,061
I'm through with business for today.
I was in the shop at nine.

122
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:16,983
This will only take you a minute.

123
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,940
No, Charlie. Save it for the morning.

124
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,782
Run along, there's a dear.

125
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:23,960
Alright, we'll let it go. Goodnight.

126
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:28,759
Johnny, I didn't mean to be
rude but I'm all worn out.

127
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:31,301
Now wait a minute.

128
00:06:31,498 --> 00:06:33,121
You're not doing me any favor, baby.

129
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,403
I just wanted to let you in
on a little quick, sure dough.

130
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,338
Some quick, sure dough?

131
00:06:38,994 --> 00:06:40,336
Listen, you old crosspatch.

132
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:42,647
I'm all in, you see.

133
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:45,266
Tomorrow I have to get
up bright and early.

134
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:47,594
But .. suppose you tell me all about it.

135
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:49,803
And I'll go in there
and get comfortable.

136
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:52,046
Comfortable?
- Yes.

137
00:06:52,554 --> 00:06:55,370
Comfortable? I haven't
been comfortable in a week.

138
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,600
You got a drink for me?

139
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,515
Me? No, I never drink the stuff.

140
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:02,625
I hate it.
- It's a great pity.

141
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:04,607
I'll try to struggle along.

142
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:07,188
What's on your mind?

143
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,811
You've heard of Ezra Stone, haven't you?

144
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:10,957
Yes. Who is he?

145
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:13,115
He's the biggest wheat
farmer in the country.

146
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:17,200
His son Mark Stone is due here and I'm
going to sell him some machinery.

147
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,852
What do you want me to do?

148
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:21,242
This fellow Mark Stone.

149
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,640
Comes from a strait-laced family, see.

150
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:28,017
Narrow-minded, you know.
- Yeah, I know.

151
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:31,709
They've got so much money,
the banks won't take it.

152
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:33,355
They have to pay storage on it.

153
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:34,880
Good to hear it.

154
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:37,338
He's a tough trader, Hallie.
And I thought ..

155
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:38,650
I'm way ahead of you.

156
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:41,052
You want me to take him to
a party and loosen him up.

157
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:42,493
And help you get the deal.

158
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:45,055
Am I right, professor?
- You're a mind reader.

159
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:48,858
You know, when those
bozos fall, they fall hard.

160
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:51,491
And you're the baby ..

161
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:53,717
That can make them stumble.

162
00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:56,527
And when Mr Stone is stumbled ..

163
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:59,117
How much in it for the
little girl who trips him?

164
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:00,800
I'll give you one percent.

165
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:04,216
Nothing doing. I can get two
percent from Kent Carr.

166
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,143
Oh, Kent Carr.

167
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,327
Yes. Kent Carr.

168
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:10,369
He's out after the same guy.

169
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,044
Well, snap.

170
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:14,385
And you were too tired?

171
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,484
I'm never too tired for
a bit of big business.

172
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:21,956
I'll give you three percent but not a
word to Kent Carr or anybody else.

173
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:23,025
Okay with me.

174
00:08:23,346 --> 00:08:25,572
I don't like Kent Carr
anyway. He's too fresh.

175
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:28,189
You keep the boys in
their places, don't you.

176
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,916
Yes, it's the only way.

177
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:32,882
A man will give you more if
you don't give him anything.

178
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,833
Not even a little promise?

179
00:08:35,675 --> 00:08:36,816
Now, Charlie.

180
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:41,095
When does your Mr Stone roll in?

181
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,077
Tonight, or tomorrow morning.

182
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:44,970
It's a big order, Hallie.

183
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:47,185
Well .. I could do with the money.

184
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:49,704
I'm saving every cent now.

185
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,630
What are you saving up for?

186
00:08:51,944 --> 00:08:53,274
To get out of this burgh.

187
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:55,452
Charlie, I've got my
life all planned out.

188
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,248
I'm off to Paris.

189
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:58,697
Yeah?
- Uhuh.

190
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:00,229
Why to Paris?

191
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:02,888
I'm going to make something of myself.

192
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,667
I'm going to be someone.

193
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:07,937
You've got enough saved up
now to take a trip to Paris.

194
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:10,133
But it isn't just a trip I want.

195
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:11,571
I'm going for keeps.

196
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:13,670
Charlie, I take French
lessons twice a week.

197
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:16,390
And Charlie .. look .. come here.

198
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:21,105
Clothes.

199
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:22,953
Aren't they marvelous?

200
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:24,491
Paris.

201
00:09:27,663 --> 00:09:28,679
What's the matter?

202
00:09:28,876 --> 00:09:30,957
Where did you get the wardrobe?

203
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:32,834
What do you mean?

204
00:09:33,545 --> 00:09:34,565
Commissions.

205
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,406
And I've got an interest in Madam
Bernstein's shop downstairs.

206
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:39,927
I believe you, Hallie.
- You should.

207
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:46,424
You think you're smart, don't you?
- Of course I'm smart.

208
00:09:46,883 --> 00:09:49,418
Someday, you'll meet some
nice kid and fall in love.

209
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:51,759
<i>Then</i> we'll see how smart you are.

210
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:53,774
Me and love? Bunk. Never.

211
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:57,251
It sneaks up on you, this love business.
- Not on this baby it won't.

212
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:00,246
I know too much about men. I hate them.

213
00:10:00,857 --> 00:10:02,518
Someday you'll marry one and then ..

214
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:03,941
Me? No, sir.

215
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,869
The only interest I have
in your fair sex is ..

216
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:08,994
The old bankroll.
- Check.

217
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,005
And then for Paris. France.

218
00:10:13,484 --> 00:10:16,121
Little fellah, you'll get
anything you go after.

219
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:17,874
You bet I will.

220
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:20,828
Don't forget mister Mark Stone.

221
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:22,902
Alright, partner. Mister Mark Stone.

222
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:24,819
Goodnight.

223
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:25,964
Goodnight.

224
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,701
Pleasant dreams.
- Thanks, Charlie.

225
00:11:02,998 --> 00:11:03,670
Hello?

226
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:05,406
Hello. Hello, dear.

227
00:11:06,613 --> 00:11:08,291
You did? That's too bad.

228
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:09,769
What time is it?

229
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:11,118
Oh.

230
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:15,091
Well call me about .. eight, will you.

231
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:16,638
Yes, I know it.

232
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:18,384
I'll catch you up sometime.

233
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:19,894
Sure.

234
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:22,225
For a long time, yes.

235
00:11:22,773 --> 00:11:23,559
Goodnight.

236
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,605
Hello Charlie, when did you get in?

237
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:26,347
Look, look. The farmer's friend.

238
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:27,680
And how.
- Kent Carr.

239
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:29,207
How are you?
- Alright, boy.

240
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:32,346
Monk, Seen Hallie this morning?
- Not seen her. We're not speaking.

241
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,417
If you mean Hallie Hobart, she's down
at Madam Bernstein's dress shop.

242
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:39,208
Much obliged. Start me on
the second car-load, baby.

243
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:43,066
Home James.

244
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,745
And don't spare the horses.

245
00:12:47,704 --> 00:12:48,943
What are you laughing at?

246
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,643
When I get to Paris I'll have one
of these every night of the week.

247
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:53,593
Take me with you.
- You, in Paris?

248
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:57,062
Come on. Make it snappy, will you Queen.
He's in the barber shop now.

249
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,637
Who?

250
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:00,737
Young David Stone.
This is the kid brother.

251
00:13:00,962 --> 00:13:02,738
He's come out to buy
the equipment instead.

252
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,796
He's a babe in arms. All you got to do
is beam on him and he'll buy anything.

253
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:08,618
Like this, Charlie?

254
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:11,794
Stop clowning, will you.
This is business.

255
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,192
Kent Carr is liable to
snap him up any minute.

256
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,121
You'll head him off with a manicure.

257
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:17,925
Alright, Charlie. I'll be right over.

258
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,063
Come on, will you.
- Now don't rush me.

259
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:22,495
Three percent, baby.

260
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:25,085
Where is the body?

261
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:27,886
The blond dome in the
second chair. Get going.

262
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,916
The sleeping beauty.

263
00:13:50,014 --> 00:13:50,662
Ah.

264
00:13:51,636 --> 00:13:52,912
Corn on the cob.

265
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:55,292
Hey, what is this?
- A manicure.

266
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,500
He's all finished, Hallie.
- Leave him to mama. I'll finish him.

267
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,602
Hey, what is this?

268
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:02,115
A manicure. Good morning.

269
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:05,327
Good morning to you.
I don't want anything like that.

270
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:07,576
Hey, don't bother with my hair, alright.

271
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:10,130
Hey, have you got my ..

272
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:12,092
Here, take this towel.
- Thank you.

273
00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:14,693
We'll put it on your account.

274
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:16,624
I would like to get my coat.

275
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,930
Alright, thanks.

276
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:22,453
Say, what am I in for, anyway?

277
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:24,771
This won't hurt you a bit.
Sit right down.

278
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:26,718
I'll try anything once.

279
00:14:28,064 --> 00:14:29,247
You sure will.
- No.

280
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:31,612
Now wait a minute.
You sit right down there.

281
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:33,385
You're in the big city now.

282
00:14:33,648 --> 00:14:34,815
I sure am.

283
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:36,710
Here. Put that one over there.

284
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:39,418
You don't get to the city much, do you.
- No, I don't.

285
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:42,042
You see, my father has just taken
over a lot of new property.

286
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:44,010
We're getting new equipment for it.

287
00:14:45,063 --> 00:14:47,030
I see. You must have a
lot of acreage up there?

288
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:48,517
It's a lot of work.

289
00:14:49,152 --> 00:14:50,310
What do you do for fun?

290
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:54,128
We've been spending most of our spare
time building that big new church.

291
00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:55,762
A church?

292
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:58,449
Well, you've heard of that
big new church my father built?

293
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,292
Yes. I believe I did hear about it.

294
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:01,850
It's a big church, isn't it.

295
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,830
Is it? Say, you should see it.

296
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:06,187
Do you know he sent to
Belgium for those bells?

297
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,058
Gee, they are old bells.

298
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,444
You can hear those bells
for miles and miles.

299
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:12,337
Playing over that wheat.
- Really?

300
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:13,720
Sounds pretty.

301
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:16,068
It is. They play a hymn every evening.

302
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:17,829
A hymn? How nice.

303
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,926
It's: 'Oh God, our help in ages past.
Our hope for years to come'.

304
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:22,962
You know?

305
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,927
Yes. Of course I know that one.

306
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:26,523
Hello Mr Stone.

307
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:28,543
Hello there. How are you?

308
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,201
How about a bite of dinner tonight?
- I'd be very glad.

309
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:32,041
Fine.

310
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:34,598
By the way, what's your preference?
Blondes or brunettes?

311
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:35,589
What?

312
00:15:35,786 --> 00:15:37,927
How would you like to have
a nice little blond mama?

313
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:40,722
Or one of these willowy brunettes.
You know.

314
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:43,221
With the dreamy eyes
and the oriental look?

315
00:15:43,571 --> 00:15:45,444
You know, with that da, da, da.

316
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:46,993
Know what I mean?

317
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,550
If you gentlemen want to talk that
way I'm afraid I must leave.

318
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:51,311
No. No, you stay here.

319
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:55,424
Say, you hadn't better talk that sort
of stuff when there's a lady around.

320
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:57,363
I see. In front of a lady.

321
00:15:57,719 --> 00:15:58,460
Okay.

322
00:15:58,657 --> 00:15:59,939
I'll see you at 7 o'clock.

323
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:02,547
I'm awfully sorry if I said
anything to hurt a lady's feelings.

324
00:16:02,924 --> 00:16:05,262
It's quite alright, sir.
But I detest vulgarity.

325
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,139
Particularly when women
are held up to ridicule.

326
00:16:08,454 --> 00:16:09,746
Sure. Sure, I understand.

327
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:11,317
Well, I'll be seeing you.

328
00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:13,359
You'll pardon my round
shoulders, won't you.

329
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:16,406
Disgusting creature.

330
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:19,023
You mean Kent Carr?
I don't know him, but ..

331
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:22,977
I have to talk business with him about
threshing machines and things like that.

332
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:25,559
There's always the daytime
for business, isn't there?

333
00:16:26,296 --> 00:16:28,026
I don't know.
It sounds impertinent of me.

334
00:16:28,223 --> 00:16:30,366
But after you told me about
that beautiful church and ..

335
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,074
And those bells and things.

336
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:35,931
It just makes me shudder to think of
you going out with a man like that.

337
00:16:36,893 --> 00:16:38,991
You're right. Say, I guess I won't go.

338
00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:41,530
I'll call him up if you say so.

339
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,903
It isn't if <i>I</i> say so, but ..

340
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:46,239
It would make me much
happier if you would.

341
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:49,231
You're very nice.

342
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:55,246
I'd hate to think I was the one
who spoiled the evening for you.

343
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:57,943
That sort of thing that
doesn't interest me any.

344
00:16:58,274 --> 00:16:59,290
I know it doesn't.

345
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,995
What's your name?
- Hallie.

346
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:04,466
Hallie Hobart.

347
00:17:04,836 --> 00:17:06,598
Miss Hobart, eh?
- No. Just Hallie.

348
00:17:07,968 --> 00:17:08,815
To everyone?

349
00:17:09,564 --> 00:17:10,522
Everyone I like.

350
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:12,739
Hallie.

351
00:17:13,037 --> 00:17:13,938
Yes, Mr Stone?

352
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:16,963
Well .. I'm David to those <i>I </i>like.

353
00:17:17,985 --> 00:17:18,997
Alright. David.

354
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:22,555
How about Hallie having
some dinner with David?

355
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,262
I'm sorry, but I have an engagement.

356
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:28,276
Gee, I'm sorry.

357
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:31,996
Are you going to call
that man and put it off?

358
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:33,541
Sure.

359
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:36,964
Well then, I'll call my engagement off.

360
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:39,331
And Hallie will have a
bit of dinner with David.

361
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:41,184
You won't?
- Yes.

362
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:42,645
Will you?
- I will.

363
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:45,055
I thought you'd have liked wrestling.

364
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:48,043
I don't mind boxing,
but I dislike wrestling.

365
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,610
You do?

366
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:53,308
Ah.

367
00:17:53,804 --> 00:17:55,873
There, you see. There is another hold.

368
00:17:56,182 --> 00:17:58,602
Now, you can take a fellow's
arm and twist it like that, see.

369
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,470
I've had enough jujitsu lessons
or this evening, thank you.

370
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,688
Do you know you can break
a fellow's arm that way.

371
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:06,222
I fully realize that.
Will you let me go?

372
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:10,622
Say.

373
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:15,615
You now, my brother Mark and I, we can
take anybody in the State for jujitsu.

374
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:16,864
Really?

375
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:19,616
I didn't hurt you, did I?
- No, no.

376
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:21,870
You just broke my arm. That's all.

377
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,676
Of course.
I'm a lot stronger than I look.

378
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:27,811
You're one of those tough guys?
- Well.

379
00:18:29,624 --> 00:18:31,441
You people here in the city.
You might say ..

380
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,508
I was what you call
a sucker, because I ..

381
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:36,687
I don't go in for this nightlife
and drinking and smoking and ..

382
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:37,665
And what?

383
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,516
Well, cavorting in general.

384
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,147
Cavorting? Oh yes.

385
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:42,370
Yes.

386
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,962
Well .. I could say you were suckers.

387
00:18:45,432 --> 00:18:46,109
Why?

388
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:51,452
Because you don't know the joy of
that dawn coming up over the wheat.

389
00:18:52,536 --> 00:18:54,026
Yes. That might be rather nice.

390
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:56,339
It's the whole thing. It's ..

391
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:58,797
Everybody waking up and everything ..

392
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:02,225
Feeling good and all the
birds singing and the ..

393
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:04,122
Dogs all going crazy.

394
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:05,601
<i>You</i> are going crazy ..

395
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:07,409
Yeah.

396
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,101
I take it you don't like
the city very much?

397
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:13,840
Well .. I don't know.
You know, it makes me kind of sad.

398
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:16,343
Were you sad with me tonight?

399
00:19:16,846 --> 00:19:18,363
No, I didn't mean that.

400
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:20,966
Well, don't drink or smoke or ..

401
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:23,520
Cavort, as you call it.

402
00:19:23,717 --> 00:19:25,449
Ah but you smoke, don't you?

403
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,545
No.
- Yes.

404
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:29,194
I saw you. I saw you
when you were talking ..

405
00:19:29,514 --> 00:19:32,173
When you talked to that woman
in the room where ladies go.

406
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,715
Me?
- Yeah.

407
00:19:34,683 --> 00:19:35,930
I got in there by mistake.

408
00:19:36,338 --> 00:19:37,550
You did, did you?

409
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:41,481
That young woman in charge,
she pushed me right out though.

410
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:43,799
And you say you saw me smoking?

411
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:45,823
Well, I thought so.

412
00:19:48,164 --> 00:19:49,812
You don't think I'd lie to you, do you?

413
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,074
No. I didn't mean that.

414
00:19:55,646 --> 00:19:57,271
Can you get any smoke on my breath?

415
00:19:58,019 --> 00:19:58,662
What?

416
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:00,763
Any smoke on my breath?

417
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:03,215
No.
- Well, can you?

418
00:20:04,182 --> 00:20:05,498
No.
- Can you?

419
00:20:14,158 --> 00:20:16,410
I .. I'm sorry.
- Don't bother.

420
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:18,539
You're just like every other man.

421
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:20,763
I thought you were different.

422
00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:23,222
I'm the one to be sorry.

423
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:26,549
I guess I .. I guess I'd better go.

424
00:20:27,196 --> 00:20:28,211
Yes, you'd better.

425
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,294
Do you often kiss women you don't love?

426
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:34,713
Do you?
- No.

427
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,535
Are you that kind?
- No, I'm not.

428
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:39,222
Well, I wouldn't have believed it.

429
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,261
Goodnight.

430
00:20:45,027 --> 00:20:45,813
Goodnight.

431
00:20:55,882 --> 00:20:57,314
Get me Charlie Thorne, will you?

432
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:01,842
Hello? Hello, Charlie?

433
00:21:02,523 --> 00:21:03,723
No. He's just gone.

434
00:21:04,341 --> 00:21:05,398
Everything is fine.

435
00:21:06,244 --> 00:21:07,656
No. Listen, just get this.

436
00:21:08,277 --> 00:21:11,020
He gave me a tiny,
tiny little kiss, see.

437
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:14,699
And I was very hurt and very indignant.

438
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:17,218
Sure. Now here's the dope.

439
00:21:17,697 --> 00:21:19,903
I've got him all steamed up
about you and the machinery.

440
00:21:20,673 --> 00:21:24,432
Tomorrow, when I see him I'm
going to be very cold. Very cold.

441
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:28,378
And when you see him, you'll be the
one who makes it all right between us.

442
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,295
That's the time you get your work in.

443
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:32,991
Sure I'm smart.

444
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:34,898
What? Paris?

445
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:37,804
Yes, sir. I'm on my way, boy.

446
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:39,832
It won't be long now.

447
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:03,234
Alright Mr Stone,
I'll explain the whole thing.

448
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:05,836
It was Friday when the kid arrived.

449
00:22:06,328 --> 00:22:07,710
He met the gal on Saturday.

450
00:22:08,235 --> 00:22:10,012
They were out together Saturday night.

451
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:12,896
They were out motoring
most of the day on Sunday.

452
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,650
I couldn't get near him
to talk any business.

453
00:22:16,098 --> 00:22:18,888
My firm called up and wanted
to know what it was all about.

454
00:22:19,523 --> 00:22:21,018
So I communicated with you.

455
00:22:21,896 --> 00:22:24,573
I thought you ought to know that
this dame had hooked him.

456
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,050
And boy, when I say hooked him ..

457
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:28,605
I don't mean 'maybe'.

458
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,826
There she is now.

459
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,357
The Stone deal is off.
- What?

460
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:52,462
Mark Stone blew into town this morning
and he's burning up about you.

461
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:53,886
About me? What did I do?

462
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,482
Only sent that kid brother
David off his nuts about you.

463
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:58,931
I can't help that.
It was in the deal, wasn't it?

464
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,490
He takes him back to the
wheat belt with him tonight.

465
00:23:02,433 --> 00:23:04,700
I as good as had that money in the bank.
- Yeah.

466
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:08,911
How are you, Mr Stone?
- How do you do?

467
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,991
Do you know Miss Hobart?
- I'm going to.

468
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:12,284
Well, I know you.

469
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:15,217
I'd know you anywhere.

470
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,243
David told me such a lot about you.

471
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:19,346
I'd like to talk to you privately.

472
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,878
Privately?
- Yes.

473
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:23,207
Let's see.

474
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:25,351
Let's come in here.

475
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,906
I'm going to be off for a minute, dear.

476
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:46,999
Well here we are, Mr Stone.

477
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:48,924
I must apologise for the mess.

478
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,279
You know, I'm quite a businesswoman.

479
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:53,800
Among other things, I have
an interest in this business.

480
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:55,553
What's your real business?

481
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,453
What?

482
00:23:58,681 --> 00:23:59,810
You heard what I said.

483
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,789
I don't like your tone.
- And I don't like your kind.

484
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:05,850
My kind?

485
00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:08,441
My kind?

486
00:24:10,663 --> 00:24:12,993
Well, Mr Stone. I guess there's
nothing more for us to say.

487
00:24:13,305 --> 00:24:14,578
I have a lot to say to you.

488
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:16,505
You keep your voice
down and cut that out.

489
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:17,707
I don't like it.

490
00:24:17,904 --> 00:24:20,579
You put your dirty hands on the cleanest
boy to ever step out of the wheat.

491
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,807
Oh yeah?
- Yes.

492
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:24,650
The law of this country drove
your kind off the streets.

493
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:27,326
It drove you out of your drives.
And where did it drive you to?

494
00:24:27,653 --> 00:24:29,984
To places like this. Disgraceful ..
- You stop it.

495
00:24:33,066 --> 00:24:34,024
You must be mad.

496
00:24:35,304 --> 00:24:37,154
Listen to me.
- No. You listen to me.

497
00:24:37,884 --> 00:24:40,252
I've got people in this town who
would cut your tongue out ..

498
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:42,152
For half of what you've said to me, see.

499
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,769
So keep out of my way.

500
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:46,079
How much to let him alone?

501
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:47,421
How much money?

502
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:49,008
Bah ..

503
00:24:59,883 --> 00:25:01,242
You've tried the barber shop?

504
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:03,590
Well, could you have her paged?

505
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:06,101
Or try her room again?

506
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:18,039
[ Telephone ]

507
00:25:18,866 --> 00:25:20,164
Hello .. what?

508
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,515
What? No .. no ..

509
00:25:24,883 --> 00:25:25,895
You cut me off.

510
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:39,808
I have seen that woman.
And I was right about her.

511
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:42,242
Another word from you
about her and I'll hit you.

512
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,577
Let me go.

513
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:45,899
David .. I'm going home now.

514
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:47,867
You're coming with me.
- No. You go.

515
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:50,872
Don't let me stop you, Mark. But you've
made enough trouble for one day.

516
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:52,950
Do you realise the
trouble you're headed for?

517
00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:54,799
I know just what I'm doing.
- Oh yeah?

518
00:25:55,485 --> 00:25:57,401
You poor little fool. You're mad.

519
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:01,062
You're my brother.
I'm your flesh and blood.

520
00:26:01,674 --> 00:26:03,768
Don't you see this woman
has got you in her clutches?

521
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:04,848
Shut up.

522
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,539
Get this straight, girlie.
Don't ring this room again.

523
00:26:11,758 --> 00:26:13,746
If the barbershop calls,
you don't know where I am.

524
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:16,503
Get me Mr Charlie Thorne.
He's the only one I want to talk to.

525
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:20,122
There's someone knocking at
the door. I'll call you later.

526
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:21,843
Come in.

527
00:26:25,872 --> 00:26:27,631
Hallie, what did Mark say to you?
- Plenty.

528
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:29,019
He's gone home.
- Good.

529
00:26:29,348 --> 00:26:31,320
Hallie, what did he say?
- What didn't he say?

530
00:26:31,582 --> 00:26:33,338
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

531
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:35,552
I told him if he said
another word I'd hit him.

532
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:37,377
I would have, really. Hallie.

533
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,799
You see, this is the first
quarrel we've ever had.

534
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,219
Father and Mark and ..

535
00:26:41,543 --> 00:26:44,047
What does it all matter?
I don't want to hear all this.

536
00:26:45,108 --> 00:26:47,010
You people don't mean
anything in my young life.

537
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,069
Hallie, don't say that.

538
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,827
We do mean something to you.

539
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:53,173
Why not be a nice boy and
go home with your brother?

540
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:56,726
You're all washed up now. No reason for
you hanging around any longer, is there.

541
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:58,092
Yes, Hallie. There is.

542
00:27:00,465 --> 00:27:01,370
I love you.

543
00:27:02,673 --> 00:27:03,316
What?

544
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:05,201
I love you, Hallie.

545
00:27:05,566 --> 00:27:06,496
Don't be silly.

546
00:27:07,086 --> 00:27:08,952
I'm not a child.
I know just what I'm doing.

547
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:10,758
When will it be?

548
00:27:12,078 --> 00:27:13,351
What are you talking about?

549
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,763
Our marriage.
- Marriage?

550
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:17,400
Are you proposing marriage?

551
00:27:17,985 --> 00:27:20,327
Don't pretend you didn't know.
You knew that I loved you.

552
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,365
How do you know who or what I am?

553
00:27:22,922 --> 00:27:24,643
I don't care who or what you are.

554
00:27:24,855 --> 00:27:26,499
A woman's life begins with her <i>tomorrow</i>.

555
00:27:26,776 --> 00:27:27,934
Not with her <i>yesterday</i>.

556
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,040
And your tomorrow is with me, isn't it.
- A woman's tomorrow?

557
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,752
Where did you read that?

558
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:35,052
Don't make fun.

559
00:27:35,495 --> 00:27:36,798
Don't be too serious.

560
00:27:37,326 --> 00:27:39,351
I .. I don't want to marry anyone.

561
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:43,042
No?
- No.

562
00:27:44,975 --> 00:27:47,199
Well .. I can only ask you.

563
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:50,038
And offer you my life and
that's what I'm doing, Hallie.

564
00:27:50,245 --> 00:27:51,254
[ Door knocks ]

565
00:27:55,015 --> 00:27:55,974
Send them away.

566
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:57,988
Please send them away.
- No, I can't do that.

567
00:27:58,292 --> 00:27:59,893
I'll call you later.
- But you won't.

568
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:01,674
If I say I will, I will.

569
00:28:02,154 --> 00:28:04,633
You must tell me something now.
It isn't 'no' is it? It isn't 'no'.

570
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,160
Go now, I'll call you later.

571
00:28:06,513 --> 00:28:07,242
Come in.

572
00:28:08,722 --> 00:28:10,517
Hello.
- Hello Charlie.

573
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:12,715
You want to see me?
- Yes.

574
00:28:13,046 --> 00:28:15,167
Hello David. I just saw
your brother leaving.

575
00:28:16,222 --> 00:28:16,897
Yes.

576
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:20,069
Hallie, I will see you later?
- Yes, David.

577
00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:23,158
Will you call me, or shall I call you?
- I'll call you.

578
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,333
I'll wait for your call.
- Alright.

579
00:28:27,755 --> 00:28:29,199
I'll be in my room.
- Okay.

580
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,833
What happened with brother Mark?
- What happened?

581
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,409
Charlie, what a dirty swine that man is.

582
00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:40,928
From what I can gather you
didn't make much of a hit.

583
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,109
Charlie.

584
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:44,496
He didn't mince any words.

585
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,920
He called me something that I ..

586
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:50,490
He called me something ..
- He suggested the worst?

587
00:28:50,883 --> 00:28:52,660
Yes. And then some.

588
00:28:53,511 --> 00:28:54,768
Sanctimonious hypocrite.

589
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:58,120
You know me.
Everybody around here knows me.

590
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:00,439
I'm not above getting while
the getting is good, but ..

591
00:29:01,536 --> 00:29:02,874
But he called me ..

592
00:29:03,947 --> 00:29:05,907
I never thought I really
hated anyone. But this ..

593
00:29:06,422 --> 00:29:07,522
This is it.
- Sure.

594
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:10,753
Hate is the same as love.
It sneaks up on you in the dark.

595
00:29:11,776 --> 00:29:13,044
And get this for laughs.

596
00:29:14,206 --> 00:29:16,805
Get this for a payoff.
The kid just proposed marriage.

597
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:18,854
Marriage?
- Yes, marriage.

598
00:29:19,463 --> 00:29:21,864
Isn't that a laugh?
- That's unnatural.

599
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:24,439
What a way to get even
with the Stone family.

600
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,569
What a revenge.

601
00:29:26,107 --> 00:29:29,048
I'd give anything, anything to
get even with that Mark Stone.

602
00:29:31,724 --> 00:29:32,385
Yeah?

603
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:39,621
Shoot.

604
00:29:40,494 --> 00:29:42,171
I'll marry that kid.
- Uhuh.

605
00:29:42,534 --> 00:29:44,207
And go up to the wheat with him.
- Uhuh.

606
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:46,658
And take them all for a real good time.

607
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:50,724
And grab yourself 50,000
frog skins to move out.

608
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:52,331
Sure. That's it.

609
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:54,396
50,000 dollars to leave.

610
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:55,838
Gee, what an idea.

611
00:29:57,364 --> 00:29:59,249
50,000 dollars in the old stocking.

612
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:00,788
And then off to Paris.

613
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,664
Let the wedding bells ring out.

614
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:33,335
But all your neighbors have
been using this stuff for years.

615
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:34,890
You see what I mean, Mr Stone?

616
00:30:36,063 --> 00:30:38,001
I don't do business on Sundays.

617
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:39,593
No.

618
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,643
Well.

619
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,521
In the city, we sort-of figure
Sunday as a sort-of a holiday.

620
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:49,368
In the city, yes.

621
00:30:50,747 --> 00:30:52,103
A devil's holiday.

622
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:54,018
Oh.

623
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,309
Will you join me, sir?

624
00:31:04,585 --> 00:31:05,228
Well?

625
00:31:06,628 --> 00:31:08,101
You know, as the good book says ..

626
00:31:10,143 --> 00:31:11,272
A Sunday well spent ..

627
00:31:11,672 --> 00:31:12,866
Means a week of content.

628
00:31:13,722 --> 00:31:15,572
That's it isn't it, Mr Stone?
- Yes.

629
00:31:16,316 --> 00:31:18,820
That and a lot of hard work.
- Yes, sir.

630
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:21,259
Work. Hmm.

631
00:31:22,874 --> 00:31:24,473
Well .. that's just it.

632
00:31:24,846 --> 00:31:28,600
And with this new equipment you can
save about 60 percent of the same work.

633
00:31:30,127 --> 00:31:30,945
I ..

634
00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:35,020
Mr Stone.

635
00:31:35,783 --> 00:31:36,650
Mr Stone.

636
00:31:37,623 --> 00:31:38,524
They're here.

637
00:31:39,235 --> 00:31:43,097
And David's put her in Mrs Stone's room.
- Alright, I'm coming right up.

638
00:31:43,294 --> 00:31:44,575
It's sacrilege, I say.

639
00:31:44,892 --> 00:31:47,068
I told them not to take ..
- Alright. I'm coming.

640
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:48,262
Alright.

641
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,017
That marriage.

642
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,441
Must have been quite a
shock to you, Mr Stone.

643
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:55,025
Yes. It was.

644
00:31:56,129 --> 00:31:58,129
Yes, she certainly
took that kid of yours.

645
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,862
But she's bad news if
I know it when I see it.

646
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:01,703
Oh?

647
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,305
Yeah. The kid is daffy about her.

648
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:07,666
But she's a cold dish if ever I saw one.

649
00:32:08,577 --> 00:32:09,850
Can I give you a lift, sir?

650
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:11,544
No thank you. No, I'll walk.

651
00:32:12,002 --> 00:32:13,577
I'll walk along with you, Mr Stone.

652
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,794
You don't mind if I leave
my car here, do you?

653
00:32:15,991 --> 00:32:16,892
Certainly not.

654
00:32:17,456 --> 00:32:18,250
Thank you.

655
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:22,305
Hello there, Mr Stone.

656
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,228
Hello there, Mrs Stone.

657
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:26,041
I didn't know you had a home like this.

658
00:32:26,275 --> 00:32:27,581
Do you like it?
- Hmm.

659
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:29,645
Father built it for mother.

660
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:31,482
Yes? Must have cost plenty.

661
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:34,742
Plenty? Father doesn't
care what he spends.

662
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:36,803
As long as it's for
something worthwhile.

663
00:32:37,348 --> 00:32:38,879
The church out there.
- Worthwhile?

664
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,848
What do you mean?
- Well.

665
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,030
His home and his church.

666
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:44,278
His books.

667
00:32:44,657 --> 00:32:45,970
That's father.
- Really?

668
00:32:46,594 --> 00:32:47,523
He sounds nice.

669
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,745
He is. Just wait until you meet him.

670
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:58,522
That's Mark.

671
00:32:59,457 --> 00:33:01,284
Let's go upstairs.
I want to powder my nose.

672
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:02,596
Alright.

673
00:33:16,739 --> 00:33:19,128
When young folks fall
in love, there is ..

674
00:33:19,518 --> 00:33:21,365
Nothing much you can do to stop it.

675
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:29,556
Hmm. Maybe it's nice after all.

676
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:31,523
Nice?

677
00:33:33,022 --> 00:33:35,057
Ask anyone around that hotel about her.

678
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,475
They'll tell you.

679
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:39,253
David is married to her. Not you.

680
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:41,343
Me?

681
00:33:57,296 --> 00:33:58,521
Aren't you unpacked yet?

682
00:33:58,718 --> 00:33:59,751
No.
- Why?

683
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:03,528
David. Is that your mother?

684
00:34:04,012 --> 00:34:06,582
Yes. That's mother.
- Did she die in this room?

685
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,300
Yes, Hallie. She did.

686
00:34:11,244 --> 00:34:12,910
I hate the thought of a death around me.

687
00:34:13,686 --> 00:34:14,674
It's detestable.

688
00:34:15,131 --> 00:34:16,893
But we all know mother is happy.

689
00:34:17,564 --> 00:34:19,535
What do you mean, 'happy'? In a grave?

690
00:34:26,652 --> 00:34:29,135
You know, I don't like pictures
that look right at you.

691
00:34:30,124 --> 00:34:32,292
No matter where in the room,
they always look at you.

692
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:33,330
See that?

693
00:34:33,527 --> 00:34:35,436
But Hallie. Mother would
love you just as I do.

694
00:34:35,722 --> 00:34:37,085
I'm not so sure she would.

695
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:40,401
Here. Let me do it.

696
00:34:42,771 --> 00:34:45,584
Hallie, what's the matter? You seem
to have changed somehow suddenly.

697
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:47,769
Changed? How?

698
00:34:48,174 --> 00:34:49,790
I've been watching you.
- Watching me?

699
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:53,187
I love you, I always want to be
near you, watching your moods.

700
00:34:55,537 --> 00:34:57,125
How have I changed? How?

701
00:34:58,294 --> 00:35:00,211
You have always been so confident and ..

702
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:01,964
You seem to doubt yourself.

703
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:04,708
Why should I doubt myself? Doubt what?

704
00:35:05,655 --> 00:35:08,225
You said mother wouldn't have loved
you when you know she would have.

705
00:35:10,637 --> 00:35:12,576
Has anything happened
to make you unhappy?

706
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:19,564
Hallie, is anything wrong?

707
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:21,471
No, no.

708
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:26,364
I'd give my life for you.

709
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:28,491
I think you would.

710
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:31,059
Hallie, I love you. I love you so much.

711
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:32,592
Yes, I know you do.

712
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:37,797
Hallie darling, look at me.

713
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,236
There is something in your
eyes, something way back.

714
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:43,020
Something that seems to be crying out.

715
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:44,137
It is.

716
00:35:44,796 --> 00:35:47,013
Hallie, don't ever be
unhappy. Don't. Please.

717
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:48,567
I couldn't bear it.

718
00:35:54,448 --> 00:35:55,824
Come on. Run along.

719
00:35:56,348 --> 00:35:57,392
I want to be alone.

720
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,492
When you're in love.

721
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:07,702
You make such a fool
of yourself, don't you.

722
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,742
And yet, you're not really making
a fool of yourself, are you?

723
00:36:11,939 --> 00:36:13,546
No. No, run along now.

724
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:16,511
Hammond.

725
00:36:17,851 --> 00:36:18,701
Mr Stone.

726
00:36:20,393 --> 00:36:21,158
Hammond.

727
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:24,038
I have business with Mr Carr of
the Carr Thrashing Company.

728
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:26,044
This is my foreman.
- Father.

729
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,279
He'll tell you all that
he's been telling me.

730
00:36:38,704 --> 00:36:40,806
Put it right in there, Mr Hammond.
It won't hurt a bit.

731
00:36:41,003 --> 00:36:43,448
I've been trying to tell Mr Stone
about our new models.

732
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,212
But you can't talk engines
to him on Sundays.

733
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:48,717
You found that out, eh?

734
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:51,961
Well .. she's here.

735
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:53,977
In our home.
- Yes, I know.

736
00:36:55,332 --> 00:36:56,803
What are you going to do, father?

737
00:36:57,836 --> 00:36:58,708
I don't know.

738
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,100
You should have stayed with him.

739
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:03,131
I warned him.
What more could I have done?

740
00:37:03,408 --> 00:37:04,843
You should have stayed with him.

741
00:37:05,446 --> 00:37:06,630
Poor little David.

742
00:37:07,154 --> 00:37:08,691
Poor little fool.
- Mark.

743
00:37:09,035 --> 00:37:10,531
Ask this salesman Carr about her.

744
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:12,808
She married David for money.
- Nevertheless ..

745
00:37:13,488 --> 00:37:16,140
They're married.
She bears the name of Stone.

746
00:37:16,337 --> 00:37:17,409
You can buy her off.

747
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:20,422
How about David if he loves her?
How about him?

748
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,784
Well.

749
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:24,350
He'll get over it.
It's for his own good.

750
00:37:24,947 --> 00:37:27,139
There must have been some
reason for David loving her.

751
00:37:27,336 --> 00:37:28,122
No reason.

752
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:31,807
A fine boy like that must have
seen some good in the girl.

753
00:37:32,888 --> 00:37:34,079
Good?
- Now, Mark.

754
00:37:34,661 --> 00:37:36,231
Who of us is without sin?

755
00:37:36,736 --> 00:37:38,202
We must be kind.

756
00:37:38,594 --> 00:37:41,077
Whatever she's been,
she's entitled to her chance.

757
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:43,662
If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out.

758
00:37:44,377 --> 00:37:46,057
It is your eye that's offended, Mark.

759
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:49,307
I haven't seen the girl.
- Wait until you do and you see her.

760
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:51,679
Her trade is written on her face.
- Now Mark, stop that.

761
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,811
Are you ready?

762
00:38:04,193 --> 00:38:05,852
Isn't that sunset wonderful?

763
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:08,731
All this peace after the city.

764
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:10,211
I like cities.

765
00:38:11,036 --> 00:38:13,369
The bigger and the noisier
they are, the better I like them.

766
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:18,428
This place is so quiet it depresses me.

767
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:24,509
But you'll get used to it.
You'll find yourself.

768
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,354
No I won't. I don't like it.

769
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,745
You get old and crabby
in places like this.

770
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,374
It gets you.

771
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,456
Look how it got that brother of yours.
That .. Mark.

772
00:38:35,257 --> 00:38:36,015
That one.

773
00:38:36,512 --> 00:38:37,677
Just the sudden change.

774
00:38:37,874 --> 00:38:40,581
I haven't changed. Why do you
keep on saying I've changed?

775
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:42,394
I'm never going to change. Never.

776
00:38:43,283 --> 00:38:44,024
Come on.

777
00:38:47,646 --> 00:38:49,018
You'll never change to me.

778
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:51,924
And I'll never change.

779
00:39:00,867 --> 00:39:02,025
Do you see what I mean?

780
00:39:02,288 --> 00:39:04,664
We have all the patents on
all this new equipment.

781
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:06,459
I showed Mr Stone in the city.

782
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:08,356
Hello there.

783
00:39:08,788 --> 00:39:09,801
Well, well.

784
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,133
The bride herself. How are you, kid?

785
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,642
What you doing here?

786
00:39:16,964 --> 00:39:19,167
Mr Stone asked me up.
- Hallie.

787
00:39:19,662 --> 00:39:21,873
Hallie, meet Mr Hammond.
This is our foreman.

788
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:23,974
This is Mrs Stone, Jack.
- How do you do?

789
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:26,498
Glad to meet you, Mrs Stone.
Congratulations.

790
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:27,521
Ha-ha.

791
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:29,483
Thank you. Ha-ha.

792
00:39:33,764 --> 00:39:35,587
Have you seen the
view from here, Hallie?

793
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:39,180
Thank you Mr Carr for your patience.
Put him up for the night.

794
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:45,794
Father. How are you?

795
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,179
Hallie.

796
00:39:51,994 --> 00:39:52,637
Well?

797
00:39:53,233 --> 00:39:54,532
Here we are, Mr Stone.

798
00:39:55,411 --> 00:39:57,011
Here is the happy pair.
- Yes.

799
00:39:58,204 --> 00:40:00,350
Weren't you surprised?
- Yes, I was.

800
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:03,156
But Dad, I sent you a
telegram right after.

801
00:40:03,522 --> 00:40:04,650
Yes, David. You did.

802
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,386
You don't look at all like the irate
parent they have in story books.

803
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:10,368
When the hero runs off with the heroine.

804
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,531
No, father is not that sort at all.

805
00:40:12,948 --> 00:40:13,975
I know you're not.

806
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,711
Mark. Come on.

807
00:40:22,163 --> 00:40:23,035
Come on, you.

808
00:40:23,327 --> 00:40:24,850
Come on and join the family party.

809
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:28,230
Oh Hamlet.

810
00:40:28,981 --> 00:40:31,399
I am thy father's ghost.

811
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:33,733
Suppose you come and
talk to me for a while?

812
00:40:34,004 --> 00:40:35,077
Would you like that?

813
00:40:35,274 --> 00:40:36,697
Sure .. I'd love it.

814
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,227
Then I come too.
- No.

815
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:41,250
No. You stay here and listen
to some of this man's jokes.

816
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,618
He's a very funny man.

817
00:40:44,504 --> 00:40:45,534
Very funny.

818
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:53,743
Hmm .. nice.

819
00:40:54,356 --> 00:40:55,600
You like books, don't you.

820
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,906
Yes, very much.
- David told me.

821
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,699
What is this?
- Wheat and corn.

822
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,989
And that?
- Those are the beans.

823
00:41:04,326 --> 00:41:05,169
I like corn.

824
00:41:06,037 --> 00:41:07,739
You can eat this stuff, can't you?
- Yes.

825
00:41:09,512 --> 00:41:11,071
Terrible.
- Tell me.

826
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:13,447
What part of the country are you from?

827
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:14,433
Iowa.

828
00:41:14,654 --> 00:41:16,205
Iowa? Well, well.

829
00:41:18,093 --> 00:41:19,182
Do you love David?

830
00:41:21,067 --> 00:41:22,907
Mr Stone. Speaking of love.

831
00:41:23,516 --> 00:41:25,148
My son Mark says you do not.

832
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:27,710
That Mark. He'd say anything.

833
00:41:28,342 --> 00:41:29,795
Say, how did he get that way?

834
00:41:30,189 --> 00:41:31,913
But you're not answering my question.

835
00:41:32,964 --> 00:41:34,881
Do you really love David?

836
00:41:35,385 --> 00:41:37,144
If I didn't, why should
I have married him?

837
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:39,437
Still, you're evading my question.

838
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:40,539
Evading what?

839
00:41:41,405 --> 00:41:44,407
Could you go on living here
now you are David's wife?

840
00:41:44,928 --> 00:41:46,015
Living our lives?

841
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:50,109
Now, Mr Stone. I don't know yet
what kind of a life that would be.

842
00:41:50,487 --> 00:41:52,004
And yet you married him?

843
00:41:52,432 --> 00:41:54,017
You agreed to share his life.

844
00:41:54,237 --> 00:41:55,939
What are you driving at, Mr Stone?

845
00:41:56,482 --> 00:41:57,338
Just this.

846
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:00,774
We are men who believe in the <i>one</i> woman.

847
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:03,027
The <i>one</i> love.

848
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,818
David has been nurtured in that thought.

849
00:42:06,554 --> 00:42:08,017
Ever since he was a child.

850
00:42:08,747 --> 00:42:11,116
We are simple people.
- I get you. Sure.

851
00:42:11,674 --> 00:42:14,581
Say, if this thing didn't work out,
I could always be on my way.

852
00:42:15,339 --> 00:42:17,385
I'd always planned another
kind of a life anyway.

853
00:42:17,582 --> 00:42:19,602
Why didn't you follow
the life you'd planned?

854
00:42:20,063 --> 00:42:20,707
Well.

855
00:42:20,984 --> 00:42:23,677
Because David came along
and he loved me and ..

856
00:42:24,393 --> 00:42:26,643
There you are.
- But you didn't love him.

857
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,312
You don't love him now.

858
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:31,504
That boy gave you his life.

859
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,608
This thing will crush him.
- No, sir. He'll get over it.

860
00:42:34,891 --> 00:42:35,792
Get over what?

861
00:42:36,629 --> 00:42:38,434
Well, if it doesn't work out.

862
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:44,145
I love that boy.

863
00:42:45,767 --> 00:42:46,804
He is my flesh.

864
00:42:48,088 --> 00:42:49,459
I've watched him grow.

865
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:51,885
From the time when I
could hold all of him.

866
00:42:52,505 --> 00:42:53,720
In my one hand.

867
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,149
Until now.

868
00:42:57,051 --> 00:42:58,220
In his eyes.

869
00:42:58,873 --> 00:43:01,893
I can see the reflection
of the woman I loved.

870
00:43:04,936 --> 00:43:05,554
My.

871
00:43:06,306 --> 00:43:07,598
<i>One</i> woman.

872
00:43:09,077 --> 00:43:10,041
She's gone.

873
00:43:11,746 --> 00:43:14,572
But even though it was God who took her.

874
00:43:16,777 --> 00:43:18,299
The agony of her going ..

875
00:43:19,627 --> 00:43:21,313
Is .. here.

876
00:43:23,483 --> 00:43:24,203
Here.

877
00:43:28,101 --> 00:43:29,626
You mustn't hurt.

878
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:31,714
That boy.

879
00:43:32,455 --> 00:43:35,104
I don't want to hurt him.
- Then why did you come here?

880
00:43:35,581 --> 00:43:38,362
Why did you marry him?
- Don't you talk to me like that.

881
00:43:38,942 --> 00:43:40,401
Mark talked to me that way too.

882
00:43:40,641 --> 00:43:42,891
Mark was right about you.
- Now you stop it.

883
00:43:43,468 --> 00:43:44,973
I'm going.
- Yes, go.

884
00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:47,021
Hey.

885
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:49,440
Who do you all think
you all are, anyway?

886
00:43:49,908 --> 00:43:50,494
Go.

887
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,416
I'm going .. but remember.

888
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:59,150
I'm Mrs David Stone and I've
got something coming to me.

889
00:43:59,788 --> 00:44:00,546
How much?

890
00:44:01,365 --> 00:44:02,008
What?

891
00:44:02,912 --> 00:44:04,013
How much do you want?

892
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:04,882
To go?

893
00:44:05,377 --> 00:44:07,724
Yes .. and never see him again.

894
00:44:10,236 --> 00:44:10,893
Well.

895
00:44:11,975 --> 00:44:12,925
You give me.

896
00:44:13,327 --> 00:44:15,730
Fifty thousand dollars and I'll
never see him again. Never.

897
00:44:17,703 --> 00:44:19,412
Never see him again?
- No, no.

898
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,699
Fifty thousand dollars.

899
00:44:28,456 --> 00:44:30,117
And he'll find some nice girl, I'm sure.

900
00:44:30,615 --> 00:44:31,744
It will be just right.

901
00:44:33,294 --> 00:44:34,054
David.

902
00:44:34,392 --> 00:44:35,521
Don't go in that room.

903
00:44:35,883 --> 00:44:37,079
What's he saying to her?

904
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:39,860
What should he be saying
to a creature like that?

905
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:41,784
Creature?

906
00:44:43,732 --> 00:44:44,490
Creature?

907
00:44:45,497 --> 00:44:46,181
Mark.

908
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:52,113
Take that back.

909
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:56,386
Take that back.

910
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,315
And your other cheek, you hypocrite.

911
00:45:02,709 --> 00:45:03,444
Down.

912
00:45:50,238 --> 00:45:51,010
Hammond.

913
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:53,631
Hammond .. come quick.

914
00:46:06,325 --> 00:46:07,864
Mark.
- He hit me.

915
00:46:10,275 --> 00:46:10,891
Go.

916
00:46:12,257 --> 00:46:13,088
Get out.

917
00:46:13,793 --> 00:46:14,957
Get out!
- I'm going.

918
00:46:25,771 --> 00:46:26,589
David.

919
00:46:28,109 --> 00:46:29,784
David.
- Yes, Mr Stone.

920
00:46:55,418 --> 00:46:56,578
Come on, lightning.

921
00:46:57,122 --> 00:46:58,938
Where have you been?
What have you got there?

922
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:01,571
Hallie Hobart. 417.

923
00:47:01,768 --> 00:47:03,184
I know. Where's the rest of it?

924
00:47:03,484 --> 00:47:05,653
Up in the room.
She hasn't finished packing yet.

925
00:47:06,022 --> 00:47:07,584
No? She goes out tonight.

926
00:47:07,936 --> 00:47:09,638
We must get this stuff
down to the depot.

927
00:47:09,835 --> 00:47:10,473
Hey.

928
00:47:11,917 --> 00:47:13,333
They're having a party up there.

929
00:47:16,156 --> 00:47:17,744
Listen Charlie, before we go in there.

930
00:47:18,207 --> 00:47:19,885
Make it snappy. I got a thirst.

931
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,250
You'll see a change in her.
It isn't the same Hallie.

932
00:47:22,537 --> 00:47:24,327
Women are always changing, Monk.

933
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:26,263
See if I got this right.

934
00:47:26,917 --> 00:47:29,388
Brother Mark took a swing
at the white-haired boy ..

935
00:47:29,585 --> 00:47:31,430
And the kid had to have an operation.

936
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:35,304
Hallie grabbed herself a new
bankroll and is back in the big city.

937
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:38,190
She's buying everything in sight.
She has two suites knocked into one.

938
00:47:38,634 --> 00:47:40,146
Tomorrow she shoves off for Paris.

939
00:47:40,343 --> 00:47:41,559
That's the story?
- Yes.

940
00:47:41,756 --> 00:47:44,571
Lucky girl. I'd say it was a
break in the right direction.

941
00:47:48,088 --> 00:47:50,487
Listen Charlie, it isn't a
break in the right direction.

942
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:53,461
She's brooding Charlie.
Brooding all the time.

943
00:47:53,672 --> 00:47:55,508
Monk, you're still stuck on her.
- Of course.

944
00:47:55,794 --> 00:47:56,784
I always will be.

945
00:47:56,981 --> 00:47:58,695
Love agrees with you, kid.
You look fine.

946
00:47:59,154 --> 00:48:00,913
I've been on the wagon
since Dad's funeral.

947
00:48:01,305 --> 00:48:03,795
I'm in the firm now, Charlie.
I'm all set to marry her.

948
00:48:04,266 --> 00:48:05,539
You're in the firm?
- Yep.

949
00:48:05,788 --> 00:48:08,647
Hallie isn't going to turn
you down, kid. Not Hallie.

950
00:48:09,055 --> 00:48:09,928
Here you are.

951
00:48:11,481 --> 00:48:12,364
Thanks.

952
00:48:16,113 --> 00:48:16,842
Charlie.

953
00:48:17,118 --> 00:48:18,920
I can't get her alone.
She's never alone.

954
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:21,723
She has a gang around her all the time.
- Who's she got?

955
00:48:22,705 --> 00:48:25,452
Fellows in the orchestra and
girls who hang around the hotel.

956
00:48:26,013 --> 00:48:27,000
Stuck on anybody?

957
00:48:27,492 --> 00:48:29,974
There's a new tenor that sings
downstairs with the orchestra.

958
00:48:31,122 --> 00:48:31,885
A tenor?

959
00:48:32,185 --> 00:48:34,440
She's stuck on anyone that will
stay up with her. And drink.

960
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,881
Did you say 'drink'?
- Yes.

961
00:48:37,172 --> 00:48:38,386
I thought you did.

962
00:48:38,933 --> 00:48:40,444
Let's go.
- Charlie, listen.

963
00:48:41,189 --> 00:48:42,347
She's leaving tomorrow.

964
00:48:42,627 --> 00:48:44,562
It means a final break
with the family if I ..

965
00:48:44,894 --> 00:48:46,252
Pull up stakes and follow her.

966
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:47,882
And I .. well ..

967
00:48:48,464 --> 00:48:49,937
I couldn't go on here without her.

968
00:48:50,479 --> 00:48:51,895
What do you want me to do, Monk?

969
00:48:52,241 --> 00:48:54,468
She likes you, Charlie.
You're sort-of a buddy. You know.

970
00:48:55,284 --> 00:48:57,072
She'll tell you everything.
I know she will.

971
00:48:57,317 --> 00:48:59,319
Now .. well .. simply ..

972
00:48:59,752 --> 00:49:01,627
Try to find out what's
the trouble, you see.

973
00:49:01,963 --> 00:49:05,409
And it it's money she wants, well I've
got all the money in the world now.

974
00:49:05,796 --> 00:49:07,304
I'll see what I can do.
- Fine.

975
00:49:07,501 --> 00:49:08,716
Is that the tenor fellow?

976
00:49:08,913 --> 00:49:10,713
Yes. He's giving a
farewell party for her.

977
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:15,481
Hello, Charlie.

978
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,133
Charlie, bless your heart.
- The Queen. How are you?

979
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:30,917
You're just in time.
- Time for what?

980
00:49:31,246 --> 00:49:32,575
I leave tomorrow.
- I know.

981
00:49:32,983 --> 00:49:34,702
You know everybody don't you?
- Sure.

982
00:49:35,003 --> 00:49:37,195
Charlie .. let's go inside.
I want to talk to you.

983
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:43,566
That maid.

984
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,944
I was better off when I didn't have her.

985
00:49:47,049 --> 00:49:48,525
Well, you got your ambition.

986
00:49:48,961 --> 00:49:50,656
Off to Paris with a bankroll.

987
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:53,154
Yeah, a bankroll.
- Tell Papa.

988
00:49:53,828 --> 00:49:55,329
Don't let's talk about me, Charlie.

989
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:56,986
Have a drink.
- Drinking?

990
00:49:57,309 --> 00:49:59,013
Sure, why not?
- Why not?

991
00:49:59,421 --> 00:50:01,166
Hallie, Mr Stone is calling.

992
00:50:02,525 --> 00:50:03,824
Who?
- Mr Stone.

993
00:50:04,072 --> 00:50:04,973
Stone?
- Hmm.

994
00:50:05,394 --> 00:50:07,316
Where, on the wire?
- No. He's downstairs.

995
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,988
I've gone away. I'm not here.
- Alright, kid. Don't worry. Alright.

996
00:50:15,226 --> 00:50:16,227
This is dead.

997
00:50:18,303 --> 00:50:18,946
Dead?

998
00:50:19,402 --> 00:50:20,217
Who's dead?

999
00:50:20,611 --> 00:50:22,112
Who?
- What's the matter with you?

1000
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:24,102
What did you just say just now?

1001
00:50:24,593 --> 00:50:26,084
The champagne is dead.

1002
00:50:33,712 --> 00:50:34,727
Say, what hit you?

1003
00:50:36,654 --> 00:50:37,477
Hit me?

1004
00:50:38,206 --> 00:50:38,935
Charlie.

1005
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:42,694
Nothing has hit me but a chunk
of money and a lot of fun.

1006
00:50:43,398 --> 00:50:44,723
That's all. Look.

1007
00:50:45,032 --> 00:50:46,646
Am I starting out right?
- Sure.

1008
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,416
Look at that frilled lace.
- Yeah.

1009
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,944
I'm going to get a lot
of new clothes in Paris.

1010
00:50:51,671 --> 00:50:53,573
I sail on the 14th.
- Yeah, I know.

1011
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:54,499
Come in.

1012
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:57,782
Look at that. Isn't that pretty or not?

1013
00:50:58,714 --> 00:51:01,134
All embroidered with
crystals and .. pearls.

1014
00:51:11,258 --> 00:51:13,254
What do you want?
- I want to speak to you.

1015
00:51:14,759 --> 00:51:16,844
There's nothing you can say to me.
- There is.

1016
00:51:17,362 --> 00:51:19,336
If you'll pardon me I'll shove off.
- No.

1017
00:51:19,711 --> 00:51:20,526
Stay there.

1018
00:51:20,803 --> 00:51:22,205
I'm sorry.
- You stay too.

1019
00:51:27,261 --> 00:51:28,567
Well, what is it?

1020
00:51:29,842 --> 00:51:31,000
I want to speak to you.

1021
00:51:32,046 --> 00:51:32,832
Privately.

1022
00:51:34,994 --> 00:51:36,467
These people are my friends.

1023
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:38,801
If you've anything to say, say it now.

1024
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:56,096
No.

1025
00:51:58,086 --> 00:51:59,458
I've changed my mind.

1026
00:52:05,936 --> 00:52:06,779
That's that.

1027
00:52:07,204 --> 00:52:09,179
You're a tough baby.
- Sure I am.

1028
00:52:09,441 --> 00:52:10,427
What did he want?

1029
00:52:12,142 --> 00:52:13,014
I don't know.

1030
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:16,089
Perhaps you should have
listened to what he had to say?

1031
00:52:16,754 --> 00:52:17,535
I wonder.

1032
00:52:18,042 --> 00:52:18,685
What?

1033
00:52:20,378 --> 00:52:21,250
I don't know.

1034
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:23,881
I just got a kind of funny feeling.

1035
00:52:24,372 --> 00:52:25,717
About young Stone?

1036
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:26,909
Yes.

1037
00:52:27,106 --> 00:52:28,860
That kid is kinda daffy
anyway, isn't he?

1038
00:52:29,665 --> 00:52:30,901
Who?
- Young Stone.

1039
00:52:32,114 --> 00:52:33,812
What do you mean, 'daffy'?
- I mean ..

1040
00:52:34,165 --> 00:52:35,409
What do you mean, 'daffy'?

1041
00:52:35,665 --> 00:52:37,739
Hallie, I won't argue.
I don't want to fight with you.

1042
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,174
Hallie, what's the matter with you?

1043
00:52:42,371 --> 00:52:43,795
Nothing is the matter with me.

1044
00:52:44,758 --> 00:52:45,430
Daffy.

1045
00:52:46,399 --> 00:52:48,173
I didn't say he was daffy.

1046
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,753
He was a sweet kid.

1047
00:52:51,948 --> 00:52:53,708
You bet he was a sweet kid.

1048
00:52:54,284 --> 00:52:56,208
And you love him and
you know it, little fellow.

1049
00:52:56,405 --> 00:52:57,134
Charlie.

1050
00:52:57,385 --> 00:52:58,371
Will you stop it.

1051
00:52:59,162 --> 00:53:00,350
Now don't you start.

1052
00:53:00,694 --> 00:53:01,852
And you were the <i>one</i>.

1053
00:53:02,472 --> 00:53:04,787
Charlie, stop it.
Stop it before I go crazy.

1054
00:53:05,327 --> 00:53:06,563
[ Telephone ]

1055
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,020
Yeah?

1056
00:53:09,116 --> 00:53:10,753
It's the baggage man about your trunk.

1057
00:53:14,518 --> 00:53:16,347
I don't want to talk to him.
- Hallie.

1058
00:53:16,922 --> 00:53:18,487
Get out, will you. Get out.

1059
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:19,487
'Obviously enough, the only one
who seems to understand me ..'

1060
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:24,946
'Is the Austrian specialist ..'

1061
00:54:27,312 --> 00:54:32,238
'Father brought from New York'.

1062
00:54:36,828 --> 00:54:38,244
That's three games, mister Mark.

1063
00:54:38,593 --> 00:54:39,780
Your mind is not on it.

1064
00:54:40,213 --> 00:54:42,777
Doctor. Must we really have that
woman here again? Must we?

1065
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:44,886
The boy must have nourishment and sleep.

1066
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:46,652
Would she make such a difference?

1067
00:54:46,865 --> 00:54:48,442
As I explained it to your father.

1068
00:54:49,103 --> 00:54:50,748
He has what you'd call an obsession.

1069
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:54,021
You see, ever since he became
conscious of the operation he ..

1070
00:54:54,411 --> 00:54:57,102
Wife has been on his mind to
the exclusion of everything else.

1071
00:54:57,299 --> 00:54:58,873
And that's serious.
- Yes, yes.

1072
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:01,062
It's what we call a 'fixed idea'.

1073
00:55:01,403 --> 00:55:02,726
That woman. That woman.

1074
00:55:03,041 --> 00:55:04,459
No, no. Let's have another game.

1075
00:55:04,938 --> 00:55:05,609
No.

1076
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,963
If he'd never seen her.
If he'd only never seen her.

1077
00:55:09,683 --> 00:55:11,799
You have to watch your
nerves, my friend.

1078
00:55:12,457 --> 00:55:13,796
Or we will have you ill too.

1079
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:17,299
I'm sorry, doctor. I'm sorry.

1080
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,762
You see, I ..

1081
00:55:20,223 --> 00:55:21,953
I didn't have any
sleep at all last night.

1082
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,432
David. He never closed
his eyes, poor boy.

1083
00:55:24,629 --> 00:55:26,605
I heard you talking to
him round about daylight.

1084
00:55:26,834 --> 00:55:28,375
He never stopped talking.

1085
00:55:29,405 --> 00:55:31,364
He said he felt he was going
to die at any moment.

1086
00:55:32,031 --> 00:55:33,912
He said he would tell
his mother all about it.

1087
00:55:34,618 --> 00:55:35,662
He said he could ..

1088
00:55:36,859 --> 00:55:38,696
He could hear his mother in heaven.

1089
00:55:39,017 --> 00:55:40,034
Calling him.

1090
00:55:40,865 --> 00:55:41,794
That's natural.

1091
00:55:42,568 --> 00:55:44,827
I had cases like this
continually during the war.

1092
00:55:45,177 --> 00:55:46,250
Yes?
- Shell shock.

1093
00:55:46,447 --> 00:55:48,910
You'll see a great change in
the boy when she comes back.

1094
00:55:49,381 --> 00:55:50,411
I had a case in ..

1095
00:55:50,608 --> 00:55:51,875
What is he doing now?

1096
00:55:52,218 --> 00:55:53,417
Writing another letter.

1097
00:55:54,066 --> 00:55:55,311
He's done ten pages.

1098
00:55:55,927 --> 00:55:56,639
Doctor.

1099
00:55:57,035 --> 00:55:59,439
He thinks he can drink some tea.
- Good.

1100
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,151
Break an egg in it.
- In the tea?

1101
00:56:02,691 --> 00:56:04,391
Yes. And beat it up well.

1102
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,613
If you say so, doctor.

1103
00:56:10,432 --> 00:56:11,561
That's another letter.

1104
00:56:12,598 --> 00:56:15,292
I promised to mail the last one
this morning. Thirty pages of it.

1105
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:18,088
You can't read a word of what
he writes, he writes so fast.

1106
00:56:18,285 --> 00:56:19,643
His mind runs ahead a little.

1107
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,189
Did you hear the whistle?
That's the train getting near.

1108
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,539
They'll be on that train.

1109
00:56:24,931 --> 00:56:26,599
They'll be on that train.

1110
00:56:27,103 --> 00:56:28,119
We just have time.

1111
00:56:31,322 --> 00:56:32,443
Mister Mark.
- Hmm?

1112
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:35,237
Whatever your feelings
may be, forget them.

1113
00:56:35,763 --> 00:56:36,814
Be nice to her.

1114
00:56:37,032 --> 00:56:39,389
Especially in front of the boy.
A lot depends on it.

1115
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:40,800
Doctor.

1116
00:56:41,354 --> 00:56:42,112
Do you ..

1117
00:56:42,638 --> 00:56:44,901
Do you think he'll get over this?

1118
00:56:45,534 --> 00:56:46,589
If you will ..

1119
00:56:47,287 --> 00:56:51,164
All pull together it will be alright.
A little patience. A little tolerance.

1120
00:56:51,785 --> 00:56:52,829
It will be alright.

1121
00:56:53,545 --> 00:56:55,046
Never cross your bridges.

1122
00:56:55,389 --> 00:56:56,623
Until you get to them.

1123
00:57:16,785 --> 00:57:17,655
Well, David.

1124
00:57:18,126 --> 00:57:19,027
What a letter.

1125
00:57:21,017 --> 00:57:21,707
Yes.

1126
00:57:22,448 --> 00:57:25,095
You see, I can't seem to
make it clear to Hallie that ..

1127
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:27,028
I'd like to go to Paris with her.

1128
00:57:27,441 --> 00:57:30,355
You see, she thinks I'm a rube.
She said so once.

1129
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:34,252
I can't seem to get it down in writing
that I've changed. You see ..

1130
00:57:34,783 --> 00:57:36,244
My point of view has changed.

1131
00:57:36,547 --> 00:57:38,663
Absolutely.
You've changed of course, David.

1132
00:57:39,531 --> 00:57:41,032
But you don't have to write it now.

1133
00:57:41,765 --> 00:57:43,238
You can tell her when she arrives.

1134
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:46,732
Who?
- Your wife. Hallie.

1135
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,045
Arrives where?
- Arrives here.

1136
00:57:50,044 --> 00:57:53,681
You see, your father and Mark have
changed their opinion of her entirely.

1137
00:57:53,878 --> 00:57:55,266
Your father went to get her.

1138
00:57:57,327 --> 00:57:58,966
No. No, she doesn't like it here.

1139
00:57:59,987 --> 00:58:02,456
Anyway, whatever they say,
Mark and father, they hate her.

1140
00:58:02,903 --> 00:58:04,563
No. Get that out of your mind.

1141
00:58:04,952 --> 00:58:06,076
They don't hate her.

1142
00:58:10,877 --> 00:58:11,648
Doctor.

1143
00:58:12,468 --> 00:58:13,512
You're not joking?

1144
00:58:14,698 --> 00:58:16,724
She's .. she's really coming here?

1145
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,369
Yes David, she will be
here in a few minutes.

1146
00:58:19,873 --> 00:58:21,742
They're on their way
from the station now.

1147
00:58:28,513 --> 00:58:29,586
I don't see the car.

1148
00:58:30,253 --> 00:58:31,687
I saw it coming a minute ago.

1149
00:58:33,636 --> 00:58:34,236
No.

1150
00:58:36,023 --> 00:58:36,952
Come on, David.

1151
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:38,840
Come on, change your clothes.

1152
00:58:39,037 --> 00:58:41,310
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me before?

1153
00:58:41,765 --> 00:58:43,773
Come on, come on.
Don't let her see you like this.

1154
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:45,541
Come on, change your clothes, David.

1155
00:58:45,738 --> 00:58:47,560
I couldn't let her see
me looking like this.

1156
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:49,076
Of course not. Come on.

1157
00:58:49,453 --> 00:58:50,439
Here is your tea.

1158
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:51,825
Here is your tea.

1159
00:58:52,524 --> 00:58:54,086
He wants to look good for his lady.

1160
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:55,408
Get his coat.

1161
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:57,042
Come on now, drink. Drink.

1162
00:58:57,334 --> 00:58:58,406
It will do you good.

1163
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,777
Doctor, could I take this bandage off?

1164
00:59:00,974 --> 00:59:02,726
No, no. But she will understand that.

1165
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,838
But .. I could put a cap over it?

1166
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:07,998
Of course.
- A cap would be splendid.

1167
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:09,433
Yes. Will you get one?

1168
00:59:10,194 --> 00:59:12,136
She'll think it funny I
don't take the cap off.

1169
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:12,960
No.

1170
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,423
Then I can tell her right
away or afterwards ..

1171
00:59:15,716 --> 00:59:17,247
I won't have to keep the bandage on?

1172
00:59:17,602 --> 00:59:19,929
You will be a good fellow
and you'll drink this tea.

1173
00:59:20,414 --> 00:59:21,372
Sure. I will.

1174
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,466
That's the way I like to see you, David.

1175
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:26,737
A good boy.

1176
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:29,839
She mustn't get the feeling
that I've been ill, you know.

1177
00:59:30,288 --> 00:59:32,295
Because she hates illness and death.

1178
00:59:32,785 --> 00:59:34,292
She said that's what she hated.

1179
00:59:35,342 --> 00:59:37,973
You won't tell her I've been ill?
- No, of course not. Get dressed now.

1180
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:41,123
You'll tell Mark and father not
to say I've been ill, won't you?

1181
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:42,522
Of course.
- Thanks.

1182
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,386
Come now, David. Get your clothes on.

1183
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:47,906
I'm going to ask her now. I'm going
to ask her right in front of them.

1184
00:59:48,371 --> 00:59:50,537
I'll show them they're all liars.
They're all liars.

1185
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:52,197
Now don't upset yourself.

1186
00:59:52,565 --> 00:59:55,944
You don't want your wife to come and see
you looking like a scarecrow, do you?

1187
01:00:02,305 --> 01:00:03,868
Where is she? What happened?

1188
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,212
She's not coming.

1189
01:00:06,454 --> 01:00:07,502
Not coming?
- No.

1190
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,941
Hello, Mr Stone.

1191
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:12,565
Well, you never saw such a change.

1192
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:14,691
He's as happy as a kid.
- Change?

1193
01:00:15,009 --> 01:00:15,997
He is splendid.

1194
01:00:16,837 --> 01:00:19,036
Where is that young lady?
I want to talk to her first.

1195
01:00:19,629 --> 01:00:20,615
She's not coming.

1196
01:00:22,002 --> 01:00:23,320
She's not coming?
- No.

1197
01:00:25,391 --> 01:00:26,263
What is this?

1198
01:00:26,942 --> 01:00:28,287
I've just told him she was.

1199
01:00:29,243 --> 01:00:30,596
Why didn't you telephone me?

1200
01:00:31,034 --> 01:00:32,496
I didn't think it was necessary.

1201
01:00:37,628 --> 01:00:38,500
Mister Stone.

1202
01:00:38,697 --> 01:00:40,827
You have no right to endanger
the life of your son.

1203
01:00:41,156 --> 01:00:42,832
I don't think this will kill him.

1204
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:45,000
But if he did die.

1205
01:00:45,494 --> 01:00:47,042
It would be better that he did.

1206
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,027
Rather than contaminate him ..

1207
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:50,184
With <i>that</i>.

1208
01:00:55,751 --> 01:00:57,420
What happened? Didn't you see her?

1209
01:00:57,617 --> 01:00:59,002
Yes, I saw her.

1210
01:00:59,611 --> 01:01:00,738
I don't care.

1211
01:01:01,299 --> 01:01:04,022
This is my case and I'm going ..
- This is my son.

1212
01:01:04,922 --> 01:01:06,227
This is my family.

1213
01:01:06,819 --> 01:01:08,527
I have the right to change my mind.

1214
01:01:08,887 --> 01:01:10,095
Alright, David.

1215
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:13,570
He's all dressed up like Sunday.

1216
01:01:14,744 --> 01:01:16,421
I'll talk to him myself.
- No, no.

1217
01:01:17,411 --> 01:01:18,798
You've talked too much already.

1218
01:01:20,547 --> 01:01:21,573
Well, well.

1219
01:01:21,924 --> 01:01:23,433
Mr Stone, that's just too bad.

1220
01:01:28,015 --> 01:01:28,887
Where is she?

1221
01:01:30,146 --> 01:01:31,018
She's hiding.

1222
01:01:31,385 --> 01:01:32,572
She's not coming, David.

1223
01:01:34,321 --> 01:01:34,973
No?

1224
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:37,960
David, I ..
- You see, David.

1225
01:01:38,741 --> 01:01:40,225
Your father couldn't find her.

1226
01:01:41,242 --> 01:01:43,218
She's gone away. She went abroad.

1227
01:01:46,089 --> 01:01:47,968
To Paris?
- That's right. Paris.

1228
01:01:49,044 --> 01:01:50,810
We're sending her to Paris.

1229
01:01:51,158 --> 01:01:52,202
It won't take long.

1230
01:01:52,652 --> 01:01:54,394
She said she wanted to go to Paris.

1231
01:01:56,683 --> 01:01:59,308
She'll be happy there.
- Of course David, she will.

1232
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,077
I'll write to her.
- That's right, come on.

1233
01:02:03,336 --> 01:02:04,008
David.

1234
01:02:07,073 --> 01:02:08,375
Thank you for going, father.

1235
01:02:08,637 --> 01:02:10,039
My boy, my boy.

1236
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,690
Come on, David.

1237
01:02:15,969 --> 01:02:17,919
I've been sending my
letters to the hotel.

1238
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,260
They will forward them to her?
- Of course, David.

1239
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:24,574
You sent that one this
morning, didn't you Mark?

1240
01:02:26,294 --> 01:02:27,109
Yes, David.

1241
01:02:32,387 --> 01:02:33,402
I'll write to her.

1242
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:34,872
A nice, long letter, David.

1243
01:04:14,097 --> 01:04:14,945
<i>Hello</i>.

1244
01:04:26,891 --> 01:04:28,488
There's nothing to discuss.

1245
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:29,795
Yes there is.

1246
01:04:31,419 --> 01:04:32,434
Thank you, doctor.

1247
01:04:34,228 --> 01:04:34,957
You see.

1248
01:04:35,516 --> 01:04:37,928
I wasn't quite myself when
Mr Stone called on me and ..

1249
01:04:38,883 --> 01:04:39,984
I thought afterwards.

1250
01:04:40,427 --> 01:04:41,585
After he'd gone that ..

1251
01:04:41,799 --> 01:04:43,415
It might have been something about him.

1252
01:04:43,992 --> 01:04:44,664
David.

1253
01:04:45,543 --> 01:04:46,300
And I ..

1254
01:04:46,955 --> 01:04:49,064
I thought, well it might be serious.

1255
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:50,682
It is.

1256
01:04:51,667 --> 01:04:52,672
Very serious.

1257
01:04:53,773 --> 01:04:56,837
Is there anything I can do?
- There's a lot you can do.

1258
01:04:57,141 --> 01:04:58,501
There's nothing she can do.

1259
01:04:58,698 --> 01:05:00,174
We differ sir, on that point.

1260
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:01,452
This is my son.

1261
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:03,692
Please.
- Please, now.

1262
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:06,182
I don't want to be any more trouble.

1263
01:05:07,728 --> 01:05:09,230
I just want to do the thing that ..

1264
01:05:11,389 --> 01:05:12,261
What's right.

1265
01:05:12,568 --> 01:05:15,021
You see what I mean, doctor?
- Perfectly, Mrs Stone.

1266
01:05:15,688 --> 01:05:17,561
You say you want to do the right thing.

1267
01:05:18,258 --> 01:05:20,958
The only right thing you can do is
leave this house right now. At once.

1268
01:05:21,155 --> 01:05:22,656
Yes, I know. I'm out of place here.

1269
01:05:23,235 --> 01:05:25,125
I haven't felt right here
ever since I came.

1270
01:05:27,998 --> 01:05:29,414
I wouldn't have come here today.

1271
01:05:30,163 --> 01:05:31,849
If I hadn't the feeling that ..

1272
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:33,179
Perhaps.

1273
01:05:33,711 --> 01:05:35,802
Of course. You felt that
David needed you.

1274
01:05:36,005 --> 01:05:36,725
Yes.

1275
01:05:37,335 --> 01:05:38,860
I had a feeling that ..
- You ..?

1276
01:05:40,617 --> 01:05:42,140
What could <i>you</i> feel?

1277
01:05:53,899 --> 01:05:54,581
Shame.

1278
01:05:56,835 --> 01:05:57,560
Maybe.

1279
01:06:00,444 --> 01:06:02,281
But Mr Stone did send for me.

1280
01:06:03,146 --> 01:06:04,876
He must have thought
I could help somehow.

1281
01:06:05,073 --> 01:06:07,561
I've changed my mind.
There's nothing you can do here now.

1282
01:06:07,817 --> 01:06:09,536
But I tell you I wasn't myself.

1283
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:11,527
I haven't been.

1284
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:13,915
I .. I'll tell you the truth.

1285
01:06:15,727 --> 01:06:17,925
I won't kid you or myself.

1286
01:06:18,491 --> 01:06:20,321
Any longer .. I ..

1287
01:06:34,228 --> 01:06:35,206
It isn't you ..

1288
01:06:36,094 --> 01:06:36,781
Is it?

1289
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:39,364
You poor kid.

1290
01:06:40,145 --> 01:06:40,990
Yes, David.

1291
01:06:41,628 --> 01:06:42,357
It's me.

1292
01:06:59,783 --> 01:07:00,644
Hallie.

1293
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:02,887
Now you are here.

1294
01:07:03,669 --> 01:07:04,913
You can tell me something.

1295
01:07:05,704 --> 01:07:06,716
You can tell me.

1296
01:07:07,999 --> 01:07:10,359
Now .. you can all hear.

1297
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:12,484
They can all hear it.

1298
01:07:13,694 --> 01:07:14,782
Hallie, you can ..

1299
01:07:16,184 --> 01:07:16,865
No.

1300
01:07:17,602 --> 01:07:18,961
No, they're all going to hear.

1301
01:07:19,158 --> 01:07:20,301
What liars they are.

1302
01:07:21,072 --> 01:07:23,187
What liars they are.
- What is it, David?

1303
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:26,127
Hallie .. they told me.

1304
01:07:26,864 --> 01:07:28,129
That when you went away.

1305
01:07:29,256 --> 01:07:30,896
They paid you money.

1306
01:07:31,357 --> 01:07:32,172
To go away.

1307
01:07:33,058 --> 01:07:34,332
That you took money.

1308
01:07:35,127 --> 01:07:35,970
To leave me.

1309
01:07:38,857 --> 01:07:40,107
It's silly, isn't it?

1310
01:07:41,752 --> 01:07:43,767
It isn't true, is it? You didn't.

1311
01:07:44,257 --> 01:07:45,149
Yes, David.

1312
01:07:45,736 --> 01:07:46,542
I did.

1313
01:07:47,653 --> 01:07:48,325
But ..

1314
01:07:48,949 --> 01:07:49,782
You?

1315
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:52,351
You took money.

1316
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:54,869
To go away and leave me?

1317
01:07:55,066 --> 01:07:56,269
David, I did. But ..

1318
01:07:57,041 --> 01:07:58,163
But I ..
- Oh no ..

1319
01:07:58,882 --> 01:08:00,895
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

1320
01:08:01,633 --> 01:08:04,008
It isn't true. I don't believe it.
- Yes.

1321
01:08:04,457 --> 01:08:06,001
No, it isn't true.

1322
01:08:07,025 --> 01:08:07,733
David.

1323
01:08:08,728 --> 01:08:09,520
Go away.

1324
01:08:10,481 --> 01:08:11,883
What are you doing?

1325
01:08:13,505 --> 01:08:14,193
David.

1326
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,204
David.

1327
01:08:26,423 --> 01:08:27,480
No, no.

1328
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:29,967
Stay down there, all of you.

1329
01:08:34,764 --> 01:08:36,752
I have to tell him something.
I've got to tell him.

1330
01:08:37,055 --> 01:08:38,597
I brought the money back. All of it.

1331
01:08:39,132 --> 01:08:41,562
All of it. Please let me go.
- No, no.

1332
01:08:42,203 --> 01:08:44,623
Look. I sold everything. Everything.

1333
01:08:45,261 --> 01:08:46,319
To get that money.

1334
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,479
Won't you let me
tell it to him before ..

1335
01:08:48,963 --> 01:08:50,640
Mr Stone, you couldn't.

1336
01:08:51,111 --> 01:08:52,327
He won't let me tell him.

1337
01:08:52,524 --> 01:08:53,895
Come quickly.
- David.

1338
01:08:54,534 --> 01:08:55,242
David.

1339
01:08:57,218 --> 01:08:57,893
David.

1340
01:08:58,525 --> 01:09:00,082
David, David. Don't die.

1341
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:03,592
Quiet please.

1342
01:09:04,836 --> 01:09:06,303
He is very ill. Let me get there.

1343
01:09:06,815 --> 01:09:08,079
I love him, I love him.

1344
01:09:08,276 --> 01:09:10,497
I can't stand it. I can't stand it.

1345
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:12,191
Be quiet now.

1346
01:09:14,521 --> 01:09:15,279
I did it.

1347
01:09:15,824 --> 01:09:16,782
I did all of it.

1348
01:09:17,243 --> 01:09:18,908
Don't take him away. Don't.

1349
01:09:19,223 --> 01:09:20,438
He's a good kid.

1350
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:21,867
A good kid.

1351
01:09:29,232 --> 01:09:30,776
What happened? What ..?

1352
01:09:31,099 --> 01:09:32,766
David .. David ..

1353
01:09:34,438 --> 01:09:35,968
Get out of here. All of you, please.

1354
01:09:36,503 --> 01:09:38,233
No please, all you. Go downstairs.

1355
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:39,495
David.

1356
01:09:40,336 --> 01:09:41,141
David.

1357
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:42,930
Come on, boy.
- What's the matter?

1358
01:09:43,228 --> 01:09:45,579
I will help you. I will help you later.

1359
01:10:04,129 --> 01:10:05,458
Steady, Mark. Steady.

1360
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:08,166
Leave him to the doctor. We can't help.

1361
01:10:09,134 --> 01:10:10,343
Have faith, Mark.

1362
01:10:11,823 --> 01:10:12,609
Stay here.

1363
01:10:18,452 --> 01:10:19,269
Well, boss.

1364
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:21,913
I got something for you.

1365
01:10:22,216 --> 01:10:23,237
Here he is.

1366
01:10:24,168 --> 01:10:26,626
A brand-new tooth.

1367
01:10:30,572 --> 01:10:32,921
How do you do, Mrs Stone?

1368
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,218
A brand-new tooth.

1369
01:10:38,505 --> 01:10:39,148
Look.

1370
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:45,303
Eleven months old and there's
nineteen pounds of her.

1371
01:10:46,391 --> 01:10:48,687
We grow good ones in
this neck of the woods.

1372
01:10:52,017 --> 01:10:54,697
Glad to see you back again, Mrs Stone.

1373
01:10:55,032 --> 01:10:56,672
Father, father.

1374
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:59,222
I want you to meet my ..

1375
01:10:59,648 --> 01:11:00,292
Anna.

1376
01:11:01,193 --> 01:11:02,687
Eighteen years with this one.

1377
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:05,184
This is Mrs Stone.

1378
01:11:06,206 --> 01:11:09,014
She went away before you had
a chance to get acquainted.

1379
01:11:09,488 --> 01:11:11,751
How do you do, Mrs Stone.
I'm so pleased to meet you.

1380
01:11:12,691 --> 01:11:13,649
Come on, father.

1381
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:17,184
She wears the pants in this family.

1382
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:20,729
Alright, mother.

1383
01:11:22,909 --> 01:11:23,604
Well.

1384
01:11:24,294 --> 01:11:25,395
He is asleep at last.

1385
01:11:25,665 --> 01:11:26,337
Oh no.

1386
01:11:26,914 --> 01:11:29,525
Asleep. Actually asleep.
His pulse is normal.

1387
01:11:30,123 --> 01:11:31,895
He fainted at the shock of seeing you.

1388
01:11:32,214 --> 01:11:33,258
He will be alright.

1389
01:11:33,571 --> 01:11:36,082
But I want to be absolutely sure ..

1390
01:11:36,279 --> 01:11:38,329
That you're going to
stay here, Mrs Stone.

1391
01:11:39,696 --> 01:11:41,082
A lot depends on you.

1392
01:11:51,509 --> 01:11:53,328
I'll stay if ..
- If what?

1393
01:11:53,571 --> 01:11:56,347
Oh I know. I know all you could say.

1394
01:11:56,585 --> 01:11:58,215
And all you have a right to say.

1395
01:11:59,714 --> 01:12:01,968
I couldn't even answer you back.

1396
01:12:04,648 --> 01:12:05,491
I am licked.

1397
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,452
I don't know.

1398
01:12:10,305 --> 01:12:12,156
I don't want anything except ..

1399
01:12:16,001 --> 01:12:16,842
I love him.

1400
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:21,980
I fought against it.

1401
01:12:23,956 --> 01:12:25,143
I don't know why, but ..

1402
01:12:26,671 --> 01:12:27,514
There it is.

1403
01:12:32,837 --> 01:12:33,839
I'll do anything.

1404
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,751
Anything you say.

1405
01:12:37,143 --> 01:12:37,921
Anything.

1406
01:12:44,134 --> 01:12:45,448
Mr Stone.

1407
01:12:46,109 --> 01:12:47,611
There <i>is</i> a chance.

1408
01:12:47,941 --> 01:12:48,784
Isn't there?

1409
01:12:49,511 --> 01:12:50,354
For someone.

1410
01:12:52,796 --> 01:12:54,363
No matter what they've done.

1411
01:12:56,592 --> 01:12:57,657
If they say that ..

1412
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:02,831
If they're .. sorry.

1413
01:13:21,539 --> 01:13:22,355
Father.

1414
01:13:23,986 --> 01:13:25,375
A young heart.

1415
01:13:25,978 --> 01:13:27,594
Is open for your love.

1416
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,038
Bless her.

1417
01:13:31,146 --> 01:13:32,456
Bless them both.

1418
01:13:33,823 --> 01:13:35,245
Never to part.

1419
01:13:36,755 --> 01:13:37,877
Amen.

1420
01:13:38,509 --> 01:13:40,197
Doctor. He's awake.

1421
01:13:40,744 --> 01:13:41,790
He's awakened now.

1422
01:13:41,987 --> 01:13:43,023
David.

1423
01:14:43,389 --> 01:14:44,259
..t-g..
