1
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:41,373
Morning.

2
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,043
Sean.

3
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:46,779
Hey.
How's it going, buddy?

4
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,781
Yeah, it came through.

5
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,285
Well, 'cause I know you like
your offers for breakfast.

6
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,122
Yeah, it's 2.5, 5% on the back
end.

7
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,024
Yeah.
Will do.

8
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,893
Hey, did you pick up my suit?

9
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:02,861
It's next to your tux. I...

10
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:04,464
Emma.

11
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:05,497
Hey!

12
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,799
How was Belize?

13
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,568
Yeah?

14
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,141
♪ This is your good morning
<i>song ♪</i>

15
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,243
♪ It will last, all day long

16
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,346
No.
I promise, it's Saturday!

17
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,681
Almost.
Tomorrow.

18
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,750
And you'll be waking up
at Cade's.

19
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:25,651
Yes!

20
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:27,386
And I get to go straight home
with him, too,

21
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:28,087
after school, right?

22
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,022
Mm-hmm.
You're his MVP.

23
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:32,424
Go get dressed.

24
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:35,461
Of course, you know you're
mine too.

25
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:37,062
You could stay here instead.

26
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:41,333
Make popcorn, cuddle,
watch Star Wars Episode 27.

27
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,735
Mom, I'm ten.

28
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,577
Can I have cereal?

29
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,580
Sure.

30
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:58,617
Wow.

31
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,119
Where's Lupe?

32
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,855
Ensenada.
Visiting her mother.

33
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:04,490
OK.

34
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:06,258
Hurry up, Sawyer.
I'm going to be late.

35
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,293
Oh, no.
I'm taking him today.

36
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,730
Like that?
Really?

37
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,999
I don't have to get out of
the car.

38
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,501
No.
I said I'm taking him.

39
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,970
Get dressed.
You have pilates at nine.

40
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,438
I like taking him.

41
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,707
And I told Cade's mom I'd
meet her to hand off the gift.

42
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:24,409
OK.
I know Cade's mom.

43
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,378
Sawyer, come on, seriously!

44
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,814
Buddy, let's do this.
I've got a flight!

45
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,015
Wait.
Where are you going?

46
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,117
The Tony's.
Rose, I told you this.

47
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,952
Wait, they're Sunday.

48
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,454
Who are the Tony's?

49
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:37,356
It's an award ceremony in New
York.

50
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,958
Daddy's client was nominated
for a play she did.

51
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,461
It's a whole weekend, Rose.
It's like the Oscars.

52
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:43,662
There's parties, there's press.

53
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,498
I just didn't realize
that you had to be there.

54
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,699
Rose, I'm her agent!

55
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,836
It is okay.
I just didn't know.

56
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,474
Can you please transfer
some money to my account?

57
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:58,310
I have that hair appointment
this afternoon.

58
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:02,514
I'll call Christophe and take
care of it.

59
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,484
I checked your account.

60
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,525
You have enough to get you
through the weekend.

61
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,223
Have fun, honey.
Brush your teeth,

62
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:13,825
and if you get lonely or
scared or anything...

63
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:14,993
Mom.

64
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,596
I know.
You're ten.

65
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,032
My perfect ten.

66
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,395
<i>...to the sky. Lift up and</i>

67
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:28,734
<i>3... 2... 1...
lower down to the ground.</i>

68
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:31,403
Wonderful job, everyone!

69
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,071
<i>Alright...</i>

70
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:48,920
Hi, Rick.

71
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,722
Rose!
I need you.

72
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,557
Go to the club today at noon.

73
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,225
<i>Garden patio, okay?</i>

74
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:56,561
<i>I want you to wear that
flowered halter tieback piece.</i>

75
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,897
Gary says, "A couple of the
partners' wives

76
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,299
are having lunch."
They know you're coming.

77
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,568
<i>Now, I want you to see if
Cliff's wife comes.</i>

78
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,771
<i>If she says anything
about him buying in.</i>

79
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,072
No, Rick.
I can't.

80
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,040
You can't?
Why?

81
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,074
Why not?

82
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,043
You know that I hate those
things.

83
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,145
Rose.
I need this information.

84
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,614
It will affect whether I make
partner.

85
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,917
Well, I-I have to take Sawyer's
P.E. clothes.

86
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,118
No, screw...

87
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,621
screw Sawyer's P.E. clothes,
OK?

88
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,056
I need you to do this.

89
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:27,192
How is me glugging down
Prosecco and butter lettuce

90
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,061
going to make you partner?

91
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,364
Okay, you know what?
You're right, you're right.

92
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:35,233
I'm sorry to interrupt the
convenience that I buy you.

93
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,903
Why don't you just go back
to reading your magazines

94
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:41,306
or whatever it is that you do,
OK?

95
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:52,851
China will own half of Wilshire by
the end of the year. I promise you.

96
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:53,919
Confucius say,

97
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:57,756
"Not a bad thing when they're
funding half your kale habit."

98
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,959
Gary. Nice to see you.

99
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,894
Ah, it's always nice to be
seen.

100
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,596
Darling, spare key.

101
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,032
Oh, are you guys sharing a car
now?

102
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:07,733
That's so cute.

103
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,067
- They're sharing a car.
- No, no.

104
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,068
It's more like trading it in.

105
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,571
This one's already five days
old.

106
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,373
Is it five?
I thought it was six.

107
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,475
It's a new model release.

108
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,210
That's it,
I'm staying off Mulholland.

109
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,478
Victoria.

110
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,047
Why can't one of your five
assistants handle this?

111
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,716
Because they're busy assisting
me, darling.

112
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,486
- Need a light, boss?
- Nope. I quit.

113
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:28,120
It's bad for you.

114
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:30,055
- But, this is good for you.
- Gary, don't!

115
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,290
Darling, please!

116
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,459
This is L.A.
No one will miss it.

117
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,527
It's like he owns the place.

118
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,962
He practically has an address
here.

119
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:40,232
And he's too lazy to drive
the forty-five minutes home

120
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,267
even though he loves his cars.

121
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,835
Rose, you've met Gary, right?

122
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:44,469
Oh, of course.

123
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,805
I thought you were heading
to New York with Rick.

124
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:47,973
We have an event tonight,

125
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,041
but I'm scooting out there
tomorrow.

126
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,977
Ladies,
always nice to see you.

127
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,145
And I was just noticing,

128
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:55,113
you in the floral and you in
the modern.

129
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,848
If you switched,
much better.

130
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,283
- Just an opinion.
- Oh, Gary!

131
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,551
Just an opinion, darling!

132
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,987
Vicki, you know me.
And, oh!

133
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,922
Dessert.
On me.

134
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:07,259
On us?
On us!

135
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,060
Stop it.

136
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,061
Keys are at valet?

137
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,431
Okay bye, darling.
Bye, girls.

138
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,498
- Bye, Gary.
- Bye.

139
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,833
God.
Such a comedian.

140
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,669
Oh, I gotta take this.

141
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,738
Dierdre, Hi.

142
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,274
Why not?

143
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,110
Dierdre, they're depending on
you.

144
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,513
No, I'll let...

145
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,582
I'm going to handle it.
Okay?

146
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,517
Did I call it or did I call
it...

147
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,152
Well. I mean, once a quitter...

148
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,521
She walked off that sitcom
on Season two.

149
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,756
She was only a recurring...

150
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:38,890
Dierdra Banks?
Cliff's wife?

151
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:39,758
Yeah, she signed up to teach

152
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,126
the Life Skills course at
New Haven

153
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,428
which is a women's shelter
the agency sponsors,

154
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,365
and now she's claiming
she's "out of her league"...

155
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,501
Hi, Nancy.

156
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,636
Hello, darling.
How are you?

157
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,038
The Tonys.
Oh.

158
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,406
Yeah.
No, have the best time.

159
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:56,875
Nancy, I'm sorry, I can't... I
can't hear you.

160
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,610
I think we're having a bad
connection.

161
00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,978
I'll get back to you.

162
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:02,247
Hey, wait a minute.

163
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:05,016
Weren't you like, Miss
Colorado, or something?

164
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,252
Arizona.
I was Miss Arizona.

165
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:10,922
Oh, that's right!
Gary was saying that.

166
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,190
So what was your cause?

167
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:15,660
My cause?
Do you mean my platform?

168
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,996
Oh, well I spoke to teen girls

169
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,966
on making your presence a
present.

170
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,436
Can probably work with that.

171
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,304
What's your day like?

172
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,545
<i>♪ Na na na na na na na, na
na na na na na ♪</i>

173
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:37,315
<i>♪ Na na na na na na na, na
na na na na na ♪</i>

174
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,651

00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,353

185
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,551
Rick made me go to this lunch,
and one of the wives there

186
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:16,054
asked if I could teach a class
to women from a shelter.

187
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,022
She gave me an address
downtown.

188
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,891
It's probably like a hotel
ballroom or something.

189
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,961
Apparently, they like topics
like self-esteem,

190
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,931
job skills,
professional wardrobing.

191
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:29,801
So, I pulled out my crown and
sash!

192
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:33,872
I don't know if it goes well,
maybe, maybe I could go back.

193
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,808
You know maybe this...
this could be my thing.

194
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,211
Anyway, I just, I thought you
might get a kick out of it.

195
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,380
It's been a while, Mom.

196
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,316
- If you get a minute, call...
- I'm sorry.

197
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:45,584
<i>your message has been erased.</i>

198
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,153
<i>To re-record your message
press one.</i>

199
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,397
Learn to drive!

200
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,535
Please leave a
<i>message after the tone.</i>

201
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,137
Hi, Sawyer!
Honey, it's me.

202
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,739
Remember, once you get out of
school

203
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,175
you can turn your ringer back
on.

204
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:13,144
Call me.
I miss you.

205
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:17,115
And remember, I'm just a phone
call away if you need anything.

206
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,617
Love you, Honey.

207
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,266
<i>You have arrived.</i>

208
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,668
Yeah.

209
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,037
Is this the New Haven shelter?

210
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:47,706
Who are you?

211
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,874
Oh, Rose Raynes.
Bev sent me to replace Deirdre.

212
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,343
I'm here to present to the
ladies.

213
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,647
Okay.
Come on in.

214
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,282
I'm Bigs.

215
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,533
It's really nice to meet you,
Bigs.

216
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:18,703
I'm sorry, could I possibly get
some help with my things?

217
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:19,904
What things?

218
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,873
Just some visuals.

219
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,409
We'll play it by ear.

220
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,211
Okay...
Yes.

221
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,011
Bigs!

222
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,647
It's Friday.
You know I need my insulin.

223
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,450
I'm playing it by the rules.
I'm playing it straight.

224
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,185
You've got to play back with
me.

225
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,107
You want to play it straight,
Jasmine?

226
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,555
Go to class today and then I'll
take you to get your insulin.

227
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,859
See, I can't even tell you how
many laws you violatin'

228
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,161
by holdin' my meds from me.

229
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,697
It's discrimination!
It's blackmail,

230
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:48,399
and I'm not even gonna mention
the disabilities act

231
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,400
'cause I know my rights!

232
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,736
You're not disabled,
you're diabetic.

233
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,673
Who Miss America?

234
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,176
She is your teacher.

235
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,044
You a real Miss America?

236
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:01,746
No.

237
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:04,182
Why do they keep bringing these
pretty-ass white bitches

238
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,517
to talk at us?

239
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:13,091
So, where do the
"white bitches" usually stand?

240
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,727
Oh, right.

241
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:16,694
Come on.
Let's go.

242
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:17,428
I'll show you where.

243
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,630
In here.
Come on.

244
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,299
So, they'll pretty much sit
anywhere.

245
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,169
You can sit on the couch
or that stool over there,

246
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,837
maybe the rug,
something like that?

247
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,373
Ah, that's okay.
I'll stand.

248
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,041
Do you have an easel?

249
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,210
A what?

250
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:33,812
Never mind.

251
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:35,113
Ladies!

252
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,147
It's class time!
Come on, let's go!

253
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,550
You know, I did like two
classes last night.

254
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:39,801
So, I'm good.

255
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:41,051
Yeah, that's great, but we
didn't have any classes

256
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:41,986
last night.

257
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,321
Yeah, No.
We watched one of those,

258
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,222
things on Dr. Phil.

259
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,657
It was a crazy intervention
thing.

260
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:46,891
Sammy and I watched it
together.

261
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,829
This woman with her daddy, her
baby-daddy, her husband,

262
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:51,763
whose child is it?

263
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,531
Dr. Phil was sweating like
Nixon.

264
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,400
It... it changed me.

265
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:56,768
Maybelle.
Maybelle.

266
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,402
Come out here.

267
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:59,137
Bring your notebook.
Let's go.

268
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:00,638
Leslie!

269
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,673
<i>Coming!</i>

270
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:02,807
Life Skills!

271
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,442
Hi!
I'm Rose.

272
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,012
Hey, you've got dinner duty

273
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:08,680
tonight, right?

274
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,148
Yeah, I got it.

275
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,516
Oh, yes, I love me some
Leslie-baby cooking.

276
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,183
What you cookin'?

277
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,918
You cook like a fat black
woman.

278
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,954
Hey, whatever twenty bucks
of ingredients gets me.

279
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,488
All right, all right.

280
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,691
Notebooks, notebooks, and give
me the phones, please.

281
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:20,425
Give me the phones.

282
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:22,493
Why you always gotta be takin'
our cell phones.

283
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,662
That's an invasion of privacy.

284
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,865
House rules.
No phones during class.

285
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,366
What time is it?

286
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,733
You got fifty-eleven clocks in
here and none of them work.

287
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:30,869
You got to tell me since

288
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:31,703
I ain't got a phone.

289
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,937
Why don't you get a watch?

290
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:33,938
It's 3:04.

291
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,340
This class ends at 4:00 p.m.

292
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:37,141
I expect you to be outside
waiting

293
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:41,179
to take me to go get my insulin
by 4:01 PM, Bigs.

294
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:41,946
Oh, wait, I need to go, too,

295
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,048
because I gotta get groceries
for dinner.

296
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,383
What's the matter with your
car?

297
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,251
It's moody.

298
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,318
Yeah, me too.

299
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,086
All right.
Listen up!

300
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,388
Class starts now.
It's 3:05...

301
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,090
60 minutes, that's house rules.

302
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,491
At 4:05, I will take anyone who

303
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:56,628
wants to go on a little errand
run, okay?

304
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,296
What's your name again?

305
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:58,830
Rose.

306
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:02,734
Rose... is taking Deirdre's
place this week, okay?

307
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:03,969
Enjoy.

308
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,672
- Thank you.
- What's this?

309
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,108
My bio.
Could you please read it?

310
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,809
...why can't you read it?

311
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,946
Well, it's written in third
person, for someone else to...

312
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:18,049
Typically before I present,
someone introduces me?

313
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,350
Yeah, that's what I just did.
That's what I did.

314
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,419
- I just introduced you.
- I'll do it!

315
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,825
"Rose Landry...

316
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:31,829
Oh. Raynes.
It's, Rose Raynes, now.

317
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,231
Rose "Raynes"

318
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,600
"Rose Raynes is a Phoenix
native

319
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,935
and daughter of Suzanna Landry

320
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:41,139
and the step daughter of the
Honorable Judge Joseph Landry.

321
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:45,076
Rose graduated from Mesa Vista
High School where she was

322
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,477
captain of the cheer squad

323
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,947
and the president of the
Thespian Society."

324
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,115
You know, I think my second
husband left me

325
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,351
for someone in the lesbian
society.

326
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:54,319
She said, "Thespian".

327
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,287
That's them girls who twirl
flags.

328
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,633
- Thespian...
- No, its...

329
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:58,589
Actually, it's like the drama
club.

330
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,325
- Yes... Yes!
- You know... acting.

331
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,293
Oh, so you an actress.

332
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:03,528
I was...

333
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,763
You know what?
Let's... let's forget the bio.

334
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:06,597
Thank you.

335
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,765
It's really out of date,
anyway.

336
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:11,936
Basically, what it says is,
many, many years ago,

337
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,237
I was Miss Arizona.

338
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,307
And now, I'm here to teach
a Life Skills class.

339
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,443
I'm filling in for Dierdra,
who...

340
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,178
had some someplace else she
had to be.

341
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,447
I wish I had some else to be.

342
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:23,715
You're being rude,
now.

343
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:25,283
You shut up, Maybelle!
You the motor mouth!

344
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,118
- Motor mouth, Maybelle!
- You know what? Both of you!

345
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,455
Shut up!
Sit down, Jasmine.

346
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:31,656
Thank you.

347
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,227
Everyday, we each wake up and
ask ourselves

348
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,161
the same question.

349
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,164
"What gift can I offer the
world?"

350
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,399
That is not my top question.

351
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,835
Were you on TV when you
were Miss Arizona?

352
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,371
The National pageant
was televised, yes.

353
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:47,205
Ya know, I was on TV, too,

354
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,407
in the studio audience of
Let's Make a Deal

355
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,043
and I almost got to come on
down but this woman

356
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,878
just bum-rushed the stage.
She just lost her mind.

357
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,214
Please! Just let her do her
presentation!

358
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,415
All right, then.

359
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,183
Continue.

360
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,519
The gifts we offer others

361
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,254
should reflect our
best selves,

362
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,123
our brightest aspirations.

363
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,225
Our boldest dreams.

364
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,626
And, when...

365
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:12,296
when we dig deep to find our
inner beauty

366
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,999
we discover the potential...

367
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,502
of our outer beauty.

368
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,540
We may not choose our names

369
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,809
or where we were born but,

370
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:27,845
the one present we always
can control...

371
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,784
is our presence.

372
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,554
I'm sorry.
I'm-I'm not prepared.

373
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:37,955
I am not what you need.

374
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:38,756
Nuh uh!

375
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,291
Nuh uh, Miss Arizona!
You ain't goin' nowhere!

376
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:43,795
If you don't do this class,
I don't get my insulin.

377
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:45,396
Teach!

378
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:49,033
Just keep going.
You're doing great.

379
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,406
Okay...

380
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,577
How about a do-over.
Yeah?

381
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,080
Life Skills.
Okay?

382
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,082
You know what, why don't we go
around the room

383
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:08,653
and each of you tells me your
name where you're from, and...

384
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:11,689
how about what you want most in
life.

385
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,792
Right now.
Jasmine let's start with you.

386
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:19,664
Jasmine from south central,
and I need 4:05 to happen.

387
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,300
Great!
Promise it will!

388
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,568
Next.

389
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:28,239
Her name's Sammy.
She moved around a lot.

390
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,675
Oh!
Her parents in the military?

391
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,844
Foster care.

392
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:36,614
Right now, she just needs
a safe place to stay.

393
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,051
Well, then I'm glad you're
here, Sammy.

394
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,752
It's nice to meet you.

395
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,690
Uh, my turn?

396
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,160
Great.
I'm Leslie.

397
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:52,463
Born and raised a Dodger.
"Whoa!"

398
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:56,734
Um, I'm a hairdresser.
Mother of three.

399
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,436
12, 10, and 7.

400
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:02,974
And, what I need most right
now is to find my boys.

401
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,243
Get em back.

402
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,046
And you don't know where
they are?

403
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,251
No.

404
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,822
After Mick created his last
masterpiece on me he...

405
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,291
he changed the locks while I
was at work.

406
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:24,162
So, a friend recommended this
place but they don't...

407
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:25,263
They don't take kids here

408
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,098
because there's not enough
room.

409
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,700
So, I just stayed here one
night.

410
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,236
Went back home the next
morning to get the boys

411
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:35,406
breakfast and off to school
and,

412
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,077
and they were gone.

413
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:48,653
Anyway, Mick's still there in
and out.

414
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,088
I drive by on my way to work.

415
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,190
Have you gone to the police?

416
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,791
Of course, she's been to the
police!

417
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,593
They make her stand on line
and fill out forms!

418
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,696
That's their answer, their
prescription for everything!

419
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,430
Paperwork!

420
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,299
Yeah, they referred me to a
lawyer

421
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,034
and a private investigator.

422
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,603
The state prosecutor's
backed up.

423
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,640
I got a pro bono group
reviewing my case.

424
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,344
In the meantime,
I'm um,

425
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,113
saving my money and

426
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,115
looking for my boys.

427
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:25,590
Yeah, I'm Maybelle,
short for Maybelline.

428
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:26,591
I grew up in Tennessee.

429
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,259
Lived all over the south,
really.

430
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,428
Followed my fourth ex-husband

431
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,696
down here in '03.

432
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,565
I'm kind of an expert
on who not to marry.

433
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:35,800
Divorce 101.

434
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:38,069
That's a life skill I could
teach!

435
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,805
Sorry, what was your question,
sweetie?

436
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,106
Oh um,

437
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,608
what you want most in life.

438
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,509
Oh, what do I want most?

439
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,110
A job!

440
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,913
That way I could leave this
joint.

441
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:49,547
A job!

442
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,716
Great!
Let's start there.

443
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,584
What would your dream job be?

444
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,820
I think I would make a great
life coach.

445
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:57,588
Those who can't do,
teach.

446
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,957
Oh, let's not dismiss her
dream.

447
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:03,694
Okay, so to be a life coach
or to get any job really,

448
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:06,597
this... this is an area where
your presence

449
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,132
literally pays off!

450
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,600
What is your job?

451
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,235
Oh, I stay at home with my son.

452
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,371
But, like before that.
What did you do?

453
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,640
Well, I got married young.
Um.

454
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:18,376
I tried acting for a minute
and,

455
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:21,212
You know, I spent my years as
Miss Arizona,

456
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:23,814
traveling and speaking to
audiences.

457
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:25,616
So what you saying is,

458
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,085
you ain't never had no real
job?

459
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,821
She in here teachin' a job
skills class

460
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,356
and ain't got one!

461
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,526
Bigs, is this some kind a
joke or somethin'?

462
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,662
<i>Jasmine, class isn't over!</i>

463
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,463
Hey, being a mom is a job.

464
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,799
So what, are you on any TV
shows,

465
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,434
like what shows what I've seen
you on?

466
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,436
It ain't like you got to apply

467
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:46,470
to be no trophy wife.

468
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,573
We in here trying to learn how
to fill out job applications.

469
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,375
Ever filled out one of them?

470
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,544
I have, actually.

471
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:54,812
You know, I'm trying
to pick up

472
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,914
a gig at night and I just...

473
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,849
I don't even know what address
to put.

474
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:00,051
You can't list this one.

475
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:02,553
For safety reasons, we just end
up looking homeless.

476
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:03,321
Yeah, I just make one up.

477
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,488
You know, they never look,
anyway.

478
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,491
Well, on any application you
only want to include things

479
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,061
that cast you in a flattering
light...

480
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,363
awards,
achievements.

481
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,332
What if you have a felony?

482
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,067
I... um...

483
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:19,070
I mean, do I list that on my
application?

484
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,908
I-I guess it depends
on the charge?

485
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,243
Girl,
you got a rap sheet a mile long.

486
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,212
It only leads up to that
felony.

487
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,780
Well it makes sense when

488
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:30,815
I explain it.

489
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:34,118
So, you know when my fourth
ex-husband left me,

490
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,586
he took my dog.

491
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:38,689
Let me tell you something.

492
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:43,194
You threaten my dog,
I'll shoot you in the face.

493
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:46,131
I see.

494
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:47,865
So, Miss Arizona.

495
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,434
Does she need to put
that on the application?

496
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,938
...I maybe wouldn't put that.

497
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,240
See, you don't know nothing
about how hard it is

498
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:59,310
to find a job when the world
don't need you.

499
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:01,112
Actually, I do.

500
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:03,047
Do you see that crown?

501
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:06,250
That is the last time someone
told me I was worth anything.

502
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:07,351
Girl, stop!

503
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:08,285
It look like you got a man

504
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:09,587
taking pretty good care of
you!

505
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:13,157
Yeah, my husband hasn't looked
me in the eyes since

506
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,393
the day our son was born.

507
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,361
And, Sawyer's ten.

508
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:21,532
Today, he told me he's too
old to hug me anymore.

509
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,934
I'd get a job if I had a degree
or experience

510
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,803
in anything besides bleaching
my teeth.

511
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:27,705
Listen, I realize it might not

512
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:30,474
seem like I have real problems
but, you know what?

513
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:34,078
I am here and I am willing
to help in any way I can.

514
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,347
Maybelle, you want to be a life
coach?

515
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:37,181
I believe you can!

516
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:38,082
I don't know what it takes,

517
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,850
but maybe I can help you find
out.

518
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:44,488
I can help all of you!

519
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,157
Amen!

520
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,592
She one of them girls that did
a monologue for her talent.

521
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,894
- Jasmine...
- What!

522
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:51,829
Why you gotta be like that?

523
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,201
Hey, Bigs? You gettin' that?

524
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:58,436
<i>Yeah.</i>

525
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,904
The house line's unlisted.

526
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:02,540
Sammy's ex got it somehow
and called yesterday.

527
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:03,674
We think he might
know she's here.

528
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:06,143
Which means here is a very
dangerous place to be.

529
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,978
Leslie!
Is your car working today?

530
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,213
Yeah, it's possible.
I don't...

531
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:10,247
Okay, we might be having some
company.

532
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:12,917
I need you guys to go and get
Jasmine's medicine

533
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,819
and don't come back until
I call you, okay?

534
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:16,353
- Okay.
- Got it.

535
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,022
Rose!

536
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,657
I'm sorry, we're going to have
to reschedule, okay?

537
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:20,991
Oh, no. That's okay.

538
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,026
Okay.

539
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:29,467
Girl, damn your car!

540
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,369
This car make me itch.

541
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:39,510
You outta gas?

542
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:41,712
It's the ignition.

543
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:46,851
Come on!

544
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:47,952
All right, all right.

545
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:48,686
This isn't working.

546
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:50,054
Let's get the Princess to take
us.

547
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:51,689
You know she's lookin'
for somethin' to do.

548
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,624
Come on, come on!
Let it go!

549
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,493
I hate this car!

550
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,128
You ask her!

551
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:04,368
Unlock it.

552
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,004
You're taking us to the
pharmacy.

553
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,472
Uh, sure.

554
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,508
Yeah.
Hop in!

555
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:20,484
This one of them cars that talk
at ya?

556
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:22,753
There's a voice control
feature.

557
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,656
You wanna step on it, grandma?

558
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:26,757
We all got a good enough reason

559
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,692
to get out of this
neighborhood.

560
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:30,361
Sure.

561
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:31,345
Would think you more

562
00:25:31,346 --> 00:25:32,346
than the rest of us.

563
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,999
<i>We've hit the 5, the 405,</i>

564
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,701
<i>the 101, all in
Friday traffic!</i>

565
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,937
<i>I said take the 110.</i>

566
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,338
<i>Hmm.</i>

567
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:43,707
Let me see, valet.
Ooh!

568
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,477
So, somebody just come and
park your car right now?

569
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:47,278
No.

570
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,512
Rich people.

571
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,048
What is all this down here?

572
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,982
So, if you put it on this,

573
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,784
this is buying a Christmas
tree?

574
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,452
What's that?

575
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:56,687
Is that for falling cactuses?

576
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:57,688
Like if you get hit by a
cactus?

577
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,224
A cactus hits you in the side,
you just press that?

578
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,326
It's been like, an hour.

579
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:04,328
More like three.

580
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,329
If you give me an address,

581
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:07,298
- we can punch it in.
- I know where I'm going.

582
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,465
Turn left.

583
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,868
Oh, no no no.
Turn right.

584
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:14,405
What's the street
name, maybe?

585
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,806
Don't worry about it,
princess.

586
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,575
She knows the street!

587
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:18,976
Sammy's carsick.

588
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:20,511
Yeah, she's gonna hurl, if you
keep

589
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:21,312
making those hairpin turns.

590
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:24,114
Y'all shut up back there.
I know where I'm goin'.

591
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,549
Besides, no one is getting car
sick

592
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,251
with Miss Turtle here on the
wheel.

593
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,052
Don't most people want to see

594
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:30,254
how fast they can drive these
things?

595
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:32,623
See that's it.
Right there.

596
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,758
"Korean Pharmacy."

597
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,627
Is it Korean insulin?

598
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:38,295
There ain't no Korean insulin,

599
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:40,030
they just got the best co-pays.

600
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,366
Alright, y'all don't go off and
leave me.

601
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:45,469
Though, I'd catch up with the
way you drive.

602
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:46,770
Hurry.

603
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:49,106
"Best co-pays."

604
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,108
Yeah, I wanna get
me some of that

605
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,910
"Korean insulin."

606
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,746
Is she diabetic?

607
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:04,688
So, what does he do?

608
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,458
Oh, are you asking me?

609
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,127
Yeah, your husband.
What does he do?

610
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,763
Oh, he's a talent agent.

611
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,432
Wait, like for actors?

612
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:15,833
Yes.

613
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,468
Do he know anyone famous?

614
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:21,271
Well, he reps most of the
people on that show.

615
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:22,539
He packaged that show.

616
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,674
Really?
I love that show!

617
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:25,542
Wait, so what does that mean,
packaged?

618
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:28,345
It's when an agent puts
together like a,

619
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:29,947
group deal of talent.

620
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:32,783
Keeps things agency friendly,
it's more commission.

621
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:35,285
I always wanted to do hair
on a movie set.

622
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:38,222
I did a shampoo commercial once
for a friend.

623
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:39,790
I did a shampoo commercial!

624
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:44,228
"Turn your locks lovely with
Lovely Locks 2-in-1."

625
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,231
I completely forgot I had
a hair appointment.

626
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:48,899
You know, Leslie can do your
hair.

627
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:51,301
Hang on, I think I saw your
commercial.

628
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,470
Dude, I recognize...
I recognize you!

629
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,305
I used to pay attention to that
kind of stuff.

630
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,975
Wait, did your husband get you
that job?

631
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,310
Only job he ever got me.

632
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,312
Really.

633
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,947
Yeah, he... he judged the Miss
Arizona pageant.

634
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:06,684
Promised me the world.
Moved me to LA.

635
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:11,822
But, then he signed some
really big clients and...

636
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:14,925
Anyway.
I got pregnant, so.

637
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:19,329
You ever meet Billy Bob
Thornton?

638
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,900
Wait, so do you like,
go to the Oscars and stuff?

639
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:23,467
I did once.

640
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:25,269
Rick's actually at the Tonys
this weekend.

641
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:28,072
Really.
So, why aren't you with him?

642
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:30,040
Oh.
It's just work for him.

643
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,609
There's no point
bringing me along.

644
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:34,745
Well, Honey.

645
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:35,746
There's just one reason

646
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:39,450
a man doesn't want to
bring his wife along.

647
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,719
Miss America!

648
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:44,288
Alright, they out.
We got to go somewhere else.

649
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,657
What's in your bag?

650
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:47,558
My insulin.

651
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,993
Don't worry I've got another
supplier around the street.

652
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:53,063
So, we can just make a quick
little drive-by.

653
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,800
Okay, do you think maybe we
could stop at a store first?

654
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:59,403
I mean, if Im cooking tonight,
I need to get a few things.

655
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,105
No, no.
We're not going back 'til we

656
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:02,106
get the all clear from Bigs.

657
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:03,874
Well, I'm starving.
We gotta eat some time.

658
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:06,510
Okay, well there's a taco
truck right there, so,

659
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:08,345
twenty bucks of tacos it is.

660
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,516
Okay, give me one chimichanga.

661
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:13,951
A combo.
I need some chips.

662
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,953
I don't have enough.
I told you.

663
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,755
You can't have the munchies
yet,

664
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:18,956
it's only been like 5 minutes.

665
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:20,557
Popped out like eight kids.

666
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,026
Sammy. Just one taco?

667
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:25,395
Rose, you sure I can't
get you something?

668
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:27,498
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Thank you.

669
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,867
Are you sure?
I got three bucks left.

670
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:32,903
You don't want like a taquito
or anything?

671
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:34,705
You have it.

672
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:35,906
We'll split it.

673
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:36,740
You got all that extra money

674
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:38,442
but you can't give me no
chips?

675
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:39,376
Zip it.

676
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,211
Girl, you better eat that
taquito!

677
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,213
That's it.
Thank you.

678
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:50,687
Oh, no.

679
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:56,860
No bueno?

680
00:29:56,929 --> 00:30:01,632
I just haven't really felt much
like eating lately.

681
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,600
I can't even imagine.

682
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,604
Sawyer's at his first sleepover
tonight and I...

683
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,777
Mama can't rest without
her cubs.

684
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,815
You have a ten-year-old too,
right?

685
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:18,816
Yeah.

686
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,317
What is he into?

687
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:25,155
You know.
Soccer, friends.

688
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:26,456
Oh, who am I kidding.

689
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:29,092
Not showering, not doing his
homework,

690
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:32,663
and you know,
thinking he's too old for me.

691
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:33,864
Mine, too.

692
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,699
Sawyer used to be my little
buddy.

693
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,000
He would hold my hand at the

694
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,068
mall, and play with my hair,

695
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,470
and now, he just looks at me
like,

696
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,005
"Where you come from?"

697
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:47,845
You'll get them back.

698
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,851
I won't stop until I do.

699
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,325
I worried this might happen.

700
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:05,295
He always threatened that if I
left,

701
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:07,831
I'd never see my boys again.

702
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,167
But, I just never...

703
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,171
Anyway.

704
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,440
At some point you have to
wonder

705
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:19,209
if you're doing your boys more
harm

706
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,278
letting them see their dad

707
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,448
treat their mom a certain way,
you know?

708
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:37,561
Does she ever...

709
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:39,730
Talk?

710
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:44,801
Yeah, occasionally we can, you
know, pull a few words out.

711
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:47,638
It's a trust thing.

712
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,341
I just think it's a lot easier
for her to just

713
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:54,211
live outside of her own life,
you know?

714
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,048
Bigs told me about when she
first got to the shelter

715
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,584
it was... it was bad.

716
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,552
He...

717
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:07,090
Her ex beat her broken.

718
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:11,995
He... locked her in this tiny
little garage shed

719
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:14,264
for months on end.

720
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:17,401
Wouldn't feed her unless
she...

721
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,069
performed.

722
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:27,945
Found out the police were after
him and he just like took off.

723
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,080
Left her in there.

724
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:32,082
No food.

725
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:35,786
Took them two weeks to find
her.

726
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,055
Arizona!

727
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:39,423
Good to go?

728
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,959
You managed to finish
half a taquito.

729
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:48,966
Anyway.

730
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:51,868
We appreciate you helping us.

731
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,372
Yeah.

732
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:03,213
Right here.

733
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,581
To the right.
Pull over.

734
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,651
I don't see any drugstores.

735
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,720
He does it outta of his house.

736
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:12,856
Jasmine, are you buying drugs?

737
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,658
Yeah, duh, of course!
I told you.

738
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,060
I am not assisting in your
drug deal!

739
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:17,728
Okay, hold tight.

740
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,063
Ain't nobody gonna take
your crown away from you.

741
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:22,199
It's medicinal.
I have a condition.

742
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:25,402
It's legal now anyway.
It's all over the news.

743
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,772
Oh, are you talking about
marijuana?

744
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:30,841
Yeah, Sherlock.

745
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,944
Oh, yeah, I've actually heard
of the benefits.

746
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:36,346
My friend's daughter has
seizures and she said that

747
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,648
the PCP oil has healing
properties

748
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,250
without getting you high.

749
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,585
Yeah.

750
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:43,754
You want to get that PCP oil
any time you gotta headache,

751
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:45,655
or you know, cramps or
anything.

752
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:46,890
That'll reallly work out.

753
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,280
I'll be right back.

754
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:56,533
Maybe we should just
drive around the block.

755
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,402
She said she'll be right back.

756
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:02,105
Yeah, it might take her a
little while to pay for it.

757
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:08,145
Let's just drive around the
block.

758
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,047
Yeah.
Okay.

759
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:17,287
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

760
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:19,956
That house.

761
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:22,859
That looks familiar.
That's... that's Dusty's house.

762
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:24,227
Who's Dusty?

763
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,462
It's Mick's cousin.

764
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:27,898
- Mick's Leslie's husband.
- Ex!

765
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,066
Ex.

766
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:31,234
That's Mick's car.

767
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:32,869
They're here!

768
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,905
- My boys are here!
- Hey hey hey!

769
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,273
What are you doing?!

770
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,640
- My boys are inside!
- You got a death wish, huh?

771
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:39,059
- No!
- I know sweetie.

772
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,476
What do you think, he's going
to just hand them over to you?

773
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,746
He's been hiding them from the
cops for like two weeks!

774
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,047
I'm going in there.

775
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:45,615
She's right.
This could be dangerous.

776
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,951
We don't even know that they're
in there.

777
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:48,385
- Okay?
- What!

778
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:50,921
I know, just hang on.
We can't be stupid about this.

779
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:53,156
Rose, where are those file
folders that you have?

780
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:54,858
- They're in the back.
- Okay.

781
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,159
- Wait!
- Hold it!

782
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:58,628
You think a pageant brochure
is gonna get me my boys back?

783
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,997
I mean no offense, Rose, but...

784
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:01,631
All right.

785
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:02,966
Your boys have been out of
school

786
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,234
for like two weeks, right?

787
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:05,068
Yes!

788
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,003
Charlie, Leo, and James Miller.

789
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:07,637
- Right?
- Yes!

790
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,239
My feeling is that paperwork

791
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,842
has been started somewhere,
right?

792
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:12,642
What are you thinking?

793
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:14,311
I'm thinking that you're
dressed perfectly

794
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:16,346
for your new job as the
Assistant

795
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:18,148
to the head of Child
Protective Services.

796
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,417
I'm your boss,
I do the talking.

797
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:21,751
Let's go!

798
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:23,620
Please hurry!

799
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:26,857
Hey, let's go!
I thought you're an actress!

800
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,359
What...

801
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:30,127
Come on, Annette.

802
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:31,361
Annette?

803
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,597
We're not
using our real names.

804
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,098
Please!

805
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,734
What if he pulls a weapon?
I have a son, too, you know.

806
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,469
People who were trying to keep
their kids

807
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,571
don't usually pull a weapon on
the authorities.

808
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,073
Why don't we call
that authorities?

809
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:45,375
We are the authorities.
You and me!

810
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:48,578
Will you just smile, and look
pretty and serious.

811
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,113
Lemme see that.

812
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,617
Just keep your mouth shut.

813
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:04,061
What?

814
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,798
Mr. Miller?

815
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:11,569
Who are you?

816
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:15,172
I'm... Jasmine Maybelline.

817
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:15,839
I'm the director of,

818
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,808
Los Angeles Department of
Child Protective Services,

819
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,243
and this is my assistant,
Annette,

820
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:22,746
and we are here
to speak to a...

821
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:24,548
"Mick Miller" about the health

822
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,417
and well-being of his
children.

823
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:29,920
Hold on a minute.

824
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:30,954
Mick!

825
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:32,022
What?

826
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,525
Some ladies here to see you.
C.P.S.

827
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,527
Different ones than last time.

828
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:38,995
Y-Yes!

829
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,298
Unfortunately, our colleagues
who were here

830
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,366
just left a few holes in the
paperwork.

831
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:47,003
Not a big deal.
Shouldn't take too long to fix.

832
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,040
Yeah?

833
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,741
Are you Mick Miller,

834
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:56,546
the father of Leo, James, and
Charlie Miller?

835
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:57,647
Yeah.

836
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:58,715
We're from C.P.S.

837
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,618
I'm Jasmine and this is my
assistant, Annette.

838
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,353
Yeah, yeah, I already told you.

839
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,488
My kids are staying with my
sister, Sarah, for a while.

840
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,391
Alright, when Leslie ran off,
it about did them in.

841
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,126
I gotta work.

842
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:11,228
Unfortunately, our colleagues,

843
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,364
when they mixed up the
paperwork,

844
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:15,465
We...

845
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:16,466
we're just here to make it
right.

846
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:18,401
You know, sometimes when
people,

847
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,570
behave in a way that, um,

848
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,738
is unreliable and...

849
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,507
and leaves you
feeling disappointed.

850
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:27,744
So all we need is just, your
sister's address

851
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,546
and we can be out of your
hair.

852
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:31,681
It's just to process the file.

853
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,750
You know.
Paperwork.

854
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:40,824
Will you grab my phone, Dusty?

855
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:45,428
Paperwork.

856
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,063
- Yeah.
- Paperwork.

857
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,598
It's just...

858
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:56,840
"113 Hack's Cross
Louisville, Kentucky 40206."

859
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:59,409
Thank you so much.
Just one more question.

860
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:03,546
In your estimable opinion,
Mr. Miller, do you feel like,

861
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:06,716
Sarah is a competent guardian,
temporarily,

862
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:09,619
for these children while you
work out your...

863
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:10,387
domestic issues?

864
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:13,490
No I... I don't got no domestic
issues, all right?

865
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:17,460
Their mother ran off!
That's called abandonment.

866
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:18,995
Waiting for the courts
to prove it.

867
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:21,231
You're not going to give this
to Leslie now, are you?

868
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:22,699
T-That bitch is crazy!

869
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:23,733
She's gonna get them boys and

870
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:24,868
she's going to hurt them
again.

871
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,102
Nope.
This is just for our files.

872
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:29,673
You've been so helpful.
We're going to get going now.

873
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:32,542
- Thank you so much.
- Have a good night.

874
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:34,210
Yeah.

875
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,414
That was amazing!
You could be an actress!

876
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:38,982
What a waste of skin.

877
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:42,052
We gotta make a clean getaway.
Come on.

878
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:43,186
Rose!

879
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:44,120
Maybelle!
Leslie!

880
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,355
Wait up!
Wait!

881
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:46,222
Damn!

882
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:49,059
- Who those dudes? They got...
- Come on!

883
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:50,327
Get in!

884
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,296
Bitch!

885
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:54,631
Dusty, get my gun and my keys!
- Go, go, go!

886
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:56,066
Why'd you leave
me in the first place?

887
00:38:56,068 --> 00:38:57,133
Well, we found Mick.

888
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:58,034
Where are my kids?

889
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,903
- In Kentucky.
- With his sister?

890
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:02,138
Someone named Sarah.
You know her?

891
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,806
She's nuts!

892
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:04,974
She lives in a commune in the
woods.

893
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,043
No phones.
No electricity.

894
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,545
- One of them Dateline cults?
- God!

895
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:10,780
He's telling everyone
you abandoned them.

896
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:12,015
What?
No!

897
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:13,583
- I would never do that!
- We know you didn't.

898
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:15,685
We'll get your kids even if we
have to

899
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:16,586
drive to Kentucky to get em.

900
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:18,455
I don't think we can actually
drive to...

901
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:20,757
Step on it!
We've got company.

902
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:25,862
Pull over!
Hey!

903
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:27,197
Pull over!

904
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,031
They're gonna kill us!

905
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,500
Not if you drive!
Step on it!

906
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,370
They've got a gun!

907
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:35,472
Pull over!

908
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:36,706
Watch out!

909
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:38,675
Come on!
Pull over!

910
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:48,118
We shook em!
They're gone!

911
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,719
You don't get out much, do you?

912
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,855
Oh my gosh!

913
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:58,762
Girl, scoot over,
here I come.

914
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:00,864
Move, girl!
Move!

915
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:02,832
Should we double-buckle?

916
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,667
Girl, I will strangle you with
that thing!

917
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,569
Don't you harness me.
Let me do my thing.

918
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:10,907
I think we just got hit, but
what... what happened?

919
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,309
Do you have bulletproof windows
in this thing?

920
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:16,079
Rick bought this off a client.
A rapper!

921
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,782
It came with added
security features.

922
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:23,787
Surface wound!
You've got insurance.

923
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,088
This dead ends.

924
00:40:25,157 --> 00:40:28,425
Just sit back and spectate
and let me drive!

925
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:32,462
Hey, what's going on here?

926
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:35,265
Just go man, just go, go!

927
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:40,570
Y'all go on in.
I'm gonna wait right here.

928
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:46,075
Oh, you out already?

929
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:49,078
- Good behavior!
- Keep your nose clean.

930
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:51,548
Working on it.

931
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:53,783
Thank you.

932
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:54,451
I told them!

933
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,886
We know where they are, and
what do they do?

934
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:58,354
Start more paperwork!

935
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:00,757
The Kentucky police said
it would be Monday before

936
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:04,093
they could file to start
an official investigation.

937
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:05,328
Damn paperwork.

938
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,562
You can't wait until Monday for
them to process.

939
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:08,565
Your kids may be long gone by
then!

940
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:08,965
Right!

941
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,366
Can't they send someone out?

942
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:11,201
I mean, they sent someone

943
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:12,902
to the general area that I
described.

944
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:15,772
They said that they found
some old burnt building.

945
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:16,673
I mean, it's ridiculous!

946
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:19,075
They can pull up her old
library fines and her old

947
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:23,079
expired DMV records,
but they can't find my kids!

948
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,948
We're not waiting till Monday,
all right?

949
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,617
We're going to get you to
Kentucky.

950
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:29,519
- All right.
- OK.

951
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:30,553
Come on.

952
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:31,721
Let's go.

953
00:41:32,224 --> 00:41:34,023
I know how far it is.
I lived there.

954
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,226
I really don't think I can
drive to Kentucky.

955
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:38,027
My son comes home tomorrow.
I'm so sorry.

956
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,930
Oh, of course not.
I wouldn't expect you to go.

957
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:41,931
No, no we're not driving
there.

958
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,533
It would take too long.
He'd get the word out.

959
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:46,236
By the time you got there,
the kids will be long gone.

960
00:41:46,238 --> 00:41:48,471
Maybelle, I don't have room on
my card

961
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:50,373
to book a plane ticket.

962
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:51,174
I do!

963
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:52,408
I have money.
Lots of it.

964
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:56,312
Well, I don't, my husband does,
but I have a credit card.

965
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:59,148
I can fly you to Kentucky.

966
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:02,352
Wait.
You would, you would do that?

967
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:03,853
Of course!

968
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:11,394
What's up?

969
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:14,030
We're gonna fly Leslie to
Kentucky.

970
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:15,131
All right.

971
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:16,933
Let's see.
Nonstop.

972
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:19,903
Do you prefer economy,
business, or first?

973
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:22,505
I've... I've never been on a
plane.

974
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:23,406
- Really?
- No.

975
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:25,208
Pick whatever's gonna get
her there first.

976
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,911
Well, all seats technically
arrive at the same time.

977
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:29,212
Just book it!

978
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:31,648
...business.
More legroom.

979
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:32,782
Aisle or window?

980
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:35,418
- I don't...
- Window.

981
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,454
There's a red eye that leaves
from LAX in four hours.

982
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:39,522
You can make it!

983
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:42,425
- Thank you so much!
- Of course!

984
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:43,359
There's only one seat left.

985
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:45,695
Okay well then book it before
it's gone!

986
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:49,632
I'm so happy with...

987
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:52,936
What?!
It says declined!

988
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:57,173
I bought a dress

989
00:42:57,175 --> 00:43:00,410
in case Rick got an extra
ticket to the Tonys.

990
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:02,011
Can you return it?

991
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:02,845
It's not with me.

992
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:04,480
You haulin' around in this tank

993
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:06,683
and you ain't got no more than
gas money.

994
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:08,851
Rick likes to keep low limits
on credit cards.

995
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:11,454
I bet he ain't got no low
limits on his credit cards.

996
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:13,489
Let me check my debit.

997
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:16,826
Money's really not my
strong suit.

998
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:18,094
I'm sorry.

999
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:21,264
It looks like you the one
who need a life skills class.

1000
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:27,036
You guys, Bigs just texted,
"Coast not clear. Stay away."

1001
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:28,638
Just get Bigs' credit card.

1002
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,807
Bigs ain't got no eight hundred
dollars.

1003
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:32,508
Well, maybe New Haven?

1004
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:33,610
What am I supposed to say?

1005
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:35,912
I need 800 bucks to flee the
program

1006
00:43:35,914 --> 00:43:37,580
so I can chase down my kids?

1007
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:39,449
Let me make a call.

1008
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:45,922
Sorry.

1009
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:49,025
She fake... She fake!

1010
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:51,060
It's not for a hair
appointment.

1011
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:52,528
It's an emergency.

1012
00:43:52,597 --> 00:43:54,897
OK. This is why you have
an emergency credit card.

1013
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:57,600
With a thousand dollar limit!

1014
00:43:57,769 --> 00:44:00,036
Rick, please.

1015
00:44:00,105 --> 00:44:00,803
I really need it.

1016
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,672
It's just eight hundred
dollars.

1017
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:04,974
Take it from my allowance, now,
come on.

1018
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,609
It's not for that wallpaper, is
it?

1019
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:09,145
Because the bathroom does not
need grasscloth, Rose.

1020
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:12,148
No this isn't about wallpaper.
It's an emergency.

1021
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,316
It's for a friend.

1022
00:44:13,718 --> 00:44:14,718
<i>A loan.</i>

1023
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:18,221
Okay, which one of your
friends needs 800 dollars?

1024
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,657
It's for a woman I met at
a shelter today.

1025
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:24,761
Okay, so you want to give a
loan to a homeless person?

1026
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:26,195
You can kiss that goodbye.

1027
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:27,463
<i>And why'd you miss your hair
appointment?</i>

1028
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:29,899
<i>I had to pull strings to get
you...</i>

1029
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:43,479
<i>You've reached
Judge Edward Landry.</i>

1030
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:47,183
<i>Suzanna and I will be
off the grid on safari.</i>

1031
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:50,346
Beverly Hills go on strike?

1032
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:54,484
I never thought it would be so
hard to drum up 800 dollars.

1033
00:45:54,686 --> 00:45:56,819
- I'm sorry.
- It's ok.

1034
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:59,922
I got a guy who owes me a
favor.

1035
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:02,492
What kind?

1036
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,994
Not what you thinking.

1037
00:46:05,663 --> 00:46:07,563
Come on, let's drive.

1038
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,666
Leslie girl,
you lucky I love you.

1039
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:22,111
What you got here?

1040
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:23,513
What's in this box?

1041
00:46:23,515 --> 00:46:26,015
What is this?

1042
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:28,317
Oh, God!
Oh, my God.

1043
00:46:30,522 --> 00:46:31,921
Oh, my God!

1044
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:32,922
That's the creepiest thing I've
ever seen!

1045
00:46:32,924 --> 00:46:35,057
What is that?
Why is this in your car?

1046
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:37,426
Let me guess!
It's your talent!

1047
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:39,328
Yes.
That is Lolly.

1048
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,364
- Lolly?
- They have names.

1049
00:46:41,366 --> 00:46:42,632
What's so funny?

1050
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:47,737
Do you still practice, what is
it, puppeteering?

1051
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:49,572
Ventriloquism?
No, no, no.

1052
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:52,542
She hasn't come out of the
closet in like, fifteen years.

1053
00:46:52,544 --> 00:46:55,878
There's no place
like West Hollywood.

1054
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:01,350
He works over there.
Park here.

1055
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:06,656
<i>♪ Call all the ladies out,
they're in their finery ♪</i>

1056
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:08,825
<i>♪ A hundred jewels on throats</i>

1057
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:11,294
<i>♪ A hundred jewels between
teeth ♪</i>

1058
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:12,862
I didn't even
know what to bring.

1059
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:15,031
I wasn't even sure what to talk
about.

1060
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:16,632
Life Skills is kind of broad.

1061
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:20,203
So, you thought you'd let
your puppet do it for you?

1062
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:21,971
Man, get out of my way.

1063
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:22,638
Five dollar cover.

1064
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,941
- Oh, we're on the guest list.
- We don't have a list.

1065
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:26,159
Denver working the bar.

1066
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,376
We just came here to get
something from him.

1067
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:27,810
All of you?

1068
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:28,845
- Yeah.
- Yes, man!

1069
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:30,813
Just coming for some
equipment.

1070
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,415
We'll be back out in five.

1071
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:41,824
<i>♪ Livin' in ruins of a palace
within my dreams ♪</i>

1072
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:47,530
<i>♪ And you know we're on each
other's team ♪</i>

1073
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:50,333
I'll go find Denver.

1074
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:01,344
Hello, West Hollywood!

1075
00:48:01,346 --> 00:48:03,646
How are LA's
finest doing tonight?

1076
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:09,452
Who wants to see us crown this
year's Showdown Show Queen?

1077
00:48:11,122 --> 00:48:14,423
She is so pretty.
Look at her hair.

1078
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:15,091
Yeah, I think she's a

1079
00:48:15,093 --> 00:48:17,693
different kind of queen than
you're used to.

1080
00:48:17,695 --> 00:48:18,695
Oh...

1081
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:22,765
Ooh, lights on!

1082
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:26,802
As you know, contestants will
compete in evening gown,

1083
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:28,037
interview,

1084
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:29,972
and our finalists will share
their lovely talent.

1085
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:32,541
They're having a
pageant!

1086
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:34,677
Tonight's Queen will earn the
title,

1087
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:35,711
a one year membership to

1088
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:39,215
Frenchie's Fabulous Fitness
Dancing Classes,

1089
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:40,416
and a custom made purse,

1090
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:44,220
filled with fifteen hundred
dollars in cash!

1091
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:46,022
Check out this purse.
Custom made.

1092
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:48,324
Fifteen hundred dollars in
cash!

1093
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:50,026
Be cool, be cool.

1094
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:51,827
Jeez, come on.

1095
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:52,695
The party is about to start.

1096
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:55,464
So, liquor up, and we'll see
you in twenty.

1097
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:57,466
All right, get out.
Just leave.

1098
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:58,467
That queen owes me but says

1099
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:01,037
she isn't going to pay up
tonight, so,

1100
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:03,539
we need a plan C if we
gonna get you on that plane.

1101
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:04,674
I think I got one.

1102
00:49:04,676 --> 00:49:06,008
Whoever wins that purse
tonight

1103
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:08,210
gets fifteen hundred dollars,
right?

1104
00:49:08,212 --> 00:49:09,478
Right?

1105
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,247
So, we're going to win it!

1106
00:49:11,249 --> 00:49:13,349
Specifically, you!

1107
00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:14,684
What?!
No, no.

1108
00:49:14,752 --> 00:49:17,320
I'm... I'm not a "queen"
like that I'm not...

1109
00:49:17,322 --> 00:49:17,954
I saw this movie once.

1110
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:20,790
The actress who played Mary
Poppins she was a woman

1111
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:24,293
who dressed as a man,
who dressed like a woman.

1112
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,494
So, you're an actress.

1113
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:27,663
You just gonna dress like a
queen.

1114
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:29,765
OK, there are so many problems
with that plan.

1115
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:31,334
Don't even get me started.

1116
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:35,371
Why?
You won Miss Arizona, right?

1117
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:36,372
Yeah, but...

1118
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:38,574
But this is just...
you know...

1119
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:42,945
You got a car full of talent.
You got gowns, you got outfits.

1120
00:49:42,947 --> 00:49:46,949
- You even have a crown.
- But, she's not a man.

1121
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:48,918
You identify as a woman, right?

1122
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,720
- Of course, but...
- Of course.

1123
00:49:50,722 --> 00:49:55,124
So, in a lot of people's book
that would qualify you.

1124
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:56,659
Where is your makeup?

1125
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:58,094
- In the car.
- Great.

1126
00:49:58,096 --> 00:50:00,930
You know you can't just turn up
and enter these things.

1127
00:50:00,932 --> 00:50:04,567
There's always a procedure.
There's forms to fill out.

1128
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:06,135
Paperwork.

1129
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,805
I'll take care of
it.

1130
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:15,678
Where did you find it?

1131
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,447
Don't worry about it, Princess.
I gotcha.

1132
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:22,351
Oh.

1133
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,920
Can't you see the place is
occupied?

1134
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:29,825
It looks great, okay.

1135
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:36,599
Wow.
Um...

1136
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:40,770
Let's do this!

1137
00:50:40,772 --> 00:50:41,971
Yes!

1138
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:51,680
Ginger Marie Minj.

1139
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:54,917
Destiny Elizabeth Child.
What?

1140
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:56,352
Did you steal my lashes?

1141
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:58,254
Why would I steal your lashes,
girl?

1142
00:50:58,256 --> 00:51:01,023
I don't like arachnophobia.
I have arachnophobia.

1143
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:03,059
I like a nice, subtle daytime
lash.

1144
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:05,428
I know you try to give
me side- eye but you can't see...

1145
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:09,131
you can't see through those
crusty ass caterpillars you got.

1146
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:11,100
That's ok, that's ok!

1147
00:51:11,102 --> 00:51:14,470
You ain't gonna steal
nothing you never took...

1148
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:16,872
Oh, hey honey.
Can we help you?

1149
00:51:17,108 --> 00:51:18,407
Are you lost?

1150
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:22,378
- You are so beautiful.
- I know.

1151
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:25,247
Well, hello darling.

1152
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:25,815
Hi.

1153
00:51:25,817 --> 00:51:29,118
Welcome to our
lair.

1154
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,288
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1155
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:35,791
Only contestant teams
are allowed in back.

1156
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:38,227
Great,
then we're in the right place.

1157
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:40,596
Oh!
And you are?

1158
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:43,099
We're her team.
Uh, this is...

1159
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:44,300
"Arizona Night."

1160
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:45,734
We just landed.
Flight delayed.

1161
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:47,336
So if you could shoo-shoo,
flutter-flutter,

1162
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:50,406
so we could prep Miss Arizona
for the Showdown.

1163
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:52,007
How do you do?

1164
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:54,076
Mm-Hmm.
You're not on my list.

1165
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:54,977
She certainly is.

1166
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:57,046
Maybe you just lost the
paperwork.

1167
00:51:57,048 --> 00:51:59,548
I don't lose
paperwork.

1168
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:02,551
So you saying you ain't never
lose anything before?

1169
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:04,153
You never lose your
mama's lipstick?

1170
00:52:04,155 --> 00:52:06,689
You ain't ever lose the
championship soccer game

1171
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:09,492
'cause sports just wasn't yo
"thing?"

1172
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:11,127
You never lose your mind

1173
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:13,963
when an election didn't go
your way?

1174
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:15,865
- I didn't know...
- Nah!

1175
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:18,567
See, Miss Arizona ain't no
loser.

1176
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:19,535
She came here to win.

1177
00:52:19,537 --> 00:52:21,370
Now, we done taped her and
padded her

1178
00:52:21,372 --> 00:52:22,872
and flew all the way in
business class

1179
00:52:22,874 --> 00:52:24,740
from Phoenix, Arizona to help
her.

1180
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:28,711
Now you gone help us?
Or, you gonna help us?

1181
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:31,747
We don't allow silicone.

1182
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:34,016
- They're not silicone.
- I got a waiver.

1183
00:52:34,018 --> 00:52:36,585
We'll set up right
over there in the corner.

1184
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:38,888
Come on.
Let's go.

1185
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,490
Come on, ladies.

1186
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:47,163
Did you see the way she told
Braxton?

1187
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:50,099
Did you see that?

1188
00:52:50,101 --> 00:52:54,670
Oh my God... ain't nobody
talked to her like that!

1189
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:58,841
There's hairspray in that bag.

1190
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,142
Lower your voice.

1191
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:01,110
Oh, sorry.

1192
00:53:01,112 --> 00:53:03,412
No, no.
Like, "lower it."

1193
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:06,148
Like a man.
Speak from here.

1194
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:07,850
Like this?

1195
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:11,520
Nah, like you're dealing with
an Adam's apple and stuff.

1196
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,489
Like... like this?

1197
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:14,256
Um, better.

1198
00:53:14,258 --> 00:53:17,159
Okay, let's work on your
introduction.

1199
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:20,462
Okay, um... Hi,
I'm Rose Raynes.

1200
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:21,864
No, no.
You're Arizona Night.

1201
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:23,365
But that sounds like a
stripper's name.

1202
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:26,202
Perfect.
Tell us all about yourself.

1203
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:26,635
Um,

1204
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:30,406
I like...
basketball?

1205
00:53:30,408 --> 00:53:31,507
No, no, no, no.

1206
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:33,309
This is an opportunity for you
to tell us

1207
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,244
who you really are, what you
really like.

1208
00:53:35,246 --> 00:53:37,913
You know, like shopping and
shopping,

1209
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:38,948
and sitting by the pool all
day,

1210
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:42,117
- drinking mimosas, whatever.
- That's not what I do all day.

1211
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:42,585
Seriously?

1212
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:44,119
That's what I would do, if I
were you.

1213
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:45,721
Anyway.

1214
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,856
Go ahead.
Continue.

1215
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:50,526
Did you see Arizona's ankles?
She fish!

1216
00:53:50,528 --> 00:53:52,428
Girl, who cares if
she's fish.

1217
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,163
She can't enter this
competition.

1218
00:53:54,165 --> 00:53:55,130
We don't do bio-queens.

1219
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:56,432
I'm gonna take care of it,

1220
00:53:56,434 --> 00:53:58,934
babe, I told you that, okay?

1221
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:00,769
What you gonna do?

1222
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:02,605
You better, because if I don't
win,

1223
00:54:02,607 --> 00:54:06,008
I don't get my show and you
don't get your commission.

1224
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:12,414
Braxton!
How come there ain't nothin'

1225
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,382
but carrots in that
green room?

1226
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:15,451
What the hell we supposed to
do with vegetables?

1227
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:17,319
You ain't running no bunny
pageant.

1228
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:19,154
Okay, see.

1229
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:21,323
- What?
- Seriously?

1230
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:22,024
Seriously.

1231
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:26,895
You better check that attitude.
You better check that attitude!

1232
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:33,569
Ooooooh!

1233
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:36,038
I got it, I got it.

1234
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:37,840
- Here.
- OK.

1235
00:54:38,276 --> 00:54:41,677
Has anyone
seen a pair of gloves?

1236
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,513
All right, let's go watch.

1237
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:45,681
All right?

1238
00:54:45,683 --> 00:54:47,683
Go out and fight.
Keep it soft and pretty.

1239
00:54:47,685 --> 00:54:49,918
Aww!
Hug!

1240
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,923
All right, let's go!
Come on.

1241
00:54:55,393 --> 00:54:58,694
I really wish I hadn't bought
that dress.

1242
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:01,230
Yeah.
Me, too.

1243
00:55:01,232 --> 00:55:04,099
Hey, nice work with the pageant
hair.

1244
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:08,704
Miss Pasadena, 1996!

1245
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:13,809
You look beautiful.

1246
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:15,444
Thank you.

1247
00:55:15,446 --> 00:55:16,478
All right.

1248
00:55:17,248 --> 00:55:19,048
Go get em.

1249
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:21,417
What's up, party people?

1250
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,987
Tonight, you're in the right
spot watching me on stage

1251
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,188

00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,826
Seven of the most...

00:55:33,197 --> 00:55:35,898
What?
Just say it!

1256
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,267
Eight.
Okay, thank you.

You tell me now.
Now's the time you tell me.

00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:40,589
beautiful, amazing and
georgous!

1286
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:41,323
Oh, my God.
Hot!

1287
00:57:41,325 --> 00:57:44,693
While these beauties get ready
for the evening gown competition,

1288
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:46,962
this is your time to mix and
mingle, get loose,

1289
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:49,698
head to the bar and we'll
see you in fifteen.

1290
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:51,967
Hello, Rose.

1291
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:56,071
Gary?

1292
00:57:57,074 --> 00:57:59,408
So, this was your event?

1293
00:58:00,411 --> 00:58:01,410
Ta dah!

1294
00:58:01,412 --> 00:58:02,544
Okay, Princess.

1295
00:58:02,546 --> 00:58:04,780
Evening gowns!
Come on!

1296
00:58:08,252 --> 00:58:09,885
Hey, what's wrong?

1297
00:58:10,054 --> 00:58:12,988
That woman, Emerald,
is actually a man named Gary.

1298
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,123
Honey, I think they're all men
named Gary.

1299
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,875
Oh, no.
I mean I know him.

1300
00:58:16,876 --> 00:58:18,626
He's my friend's husband.
He works for Rick's talent agency!

1301
00:58:18,629 --> 00:58:19,428
For real?
He's here?

1302
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:22,130
Looks like he's got a hidden
talent of his own, huh!

1303
00:58:22,132 --> 00:58:24,533
He knows I'm not a...
He'll turn us in!

1304
00:58:24,535 --> 00:58:26,201
No, no, no.
It's better than that.

1305
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:28,670
He knows that you know
he's your friend's husband.

1306
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,839
Yeah, well, no.
He's got more to lose than you do.

1307
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:33,342
Okay, but if he turns us in,
I will be disqualified.

1308
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:35,677
Then, how will we get the
money?

1309
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:37,045
Arizona Night!

1310
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:38,280
I need you, stat!

1311
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:39,214
They know!

1312
00:58:39,216 --> 00:58:40,782
He told!
I knew it!

1313
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:42,751
- What do I say?
- You!

1314
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:43,785
Arizona!

1315
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:46,355
I need your music
for the talent?

1316
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:48,423
Music!
On it.

1317
00:58:48,425 --> 00:58:50,125
- Who's got it?
- Of course.

1318
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,660
Yes, Jasmine,
could you get it?

1319
00:58:51,662 --> 00:58:53,395
It's... um,
in that case right there.

1320
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:54,496
Shania Twain?

1321
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:56,999
I was like 13.
I was in a country phase.

1322
00:58:58,602 --> 00:58:59,434
Thanks!

1323
00:58:59,436 --> 00:59:00,602
Oh, you rude.

1324
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:01,670
Come on.
Let's get you in this.

1325
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:03,939
Okay, let's go behind
the clothing racks.

1326
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:05,307
I seen more skin in this place
in the last 20 minutes

1327
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:08,844
- I seen in my whole life.
- Yeah, but I have a few parts I need to hide!

1328
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:10,379
Fine, I got it.
I got it, I got it.

1329
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:12,347
- We need you on stage, stat!
- You good?

1330
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:14,449
Sammy, let's go watch.
Okay.

1331
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:19,121
Well, hey y'all!

1332
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:21,323
It's the mouth of the south
here provin' that

1333
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:22,624
some gingers do have souls.

1334
00:59:22,626 --> 00:59:25,761
And tonight, if you vote for
me for Showdown Show Queen,

1335
00:59:25,763 --> 00:59:29,197
you and I can do some good
for those kids at base camp.

1336
00:59:30,301 --> 00:59:33,969
You're going to need to state
your name and your causes, okay?

1337
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:36,838
My cause.
What's my cause?

1338
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,507
Just talk about your brochures
or something.

1339
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:40,742
I don't know.
It's not your first rodeo.

1340
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:43,545
Sweetheart, we all know you
support the NRA.

1341
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:45,581
I brought the guns tonight.

1342
00:59:46,383 --> 00:59:47,716
Buongiorno!

1343
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:49,551
I'm Luscious... as they come

1344
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:52,120
and I am thrilled to bring
attention

1345
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:56,758
to the Astraea Lesbian
Foundation for Justice.

1346
00:59:57,361 --> 01:00:01,597
Now, introducing Miss Arizona
Night!

1347
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:12,908
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1348
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:20,449
I'm Arizona Night and I'm
here to show support for...

1349
01:00:21,552 --> 01:00:24,386
the New Haven Women's Shelter.

1350
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:28,357
May we all dare
to hope and dream.

1351
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:31,960
Thank you, Arizona.

1352
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:35,130
Last,
but certainly not least,

1353
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:37,265
Miss Delilah!

1354
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:42,304
Don't you mean save the best
for last?

1355
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:43,405
Hi.
I'm Delilah,

1356
01:00:43,407 --> 01:00:45,207
the host of your local Talk
Truth show.

1357
01:00:45,209 --> 01:00:47,042
And I'm delighted to be here
tonight

1358
01:00:47,044 --> 01:00:49,611
as an authentic
champion for gay rights.

1359
01:00:49,613 --> 01:00:50,345
Tonight, I plan on donating

1360
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:53,315
half of my prize money to the
True Colors Foundation,

1361
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:55,617
and I hope to inspire all
the contestants

1362
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:58,253
to reveal their
true colors.

1363
01:01:01,558 --> 01:01:02,791
"Hello."

1364
01:01:02,793 --> 01:01:05,394
- "This is crazy!"
- You are so weird.

1365
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:07,262
What?
I'm not weird.

1366
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:08,563
I'm totally normal.

1367
01:01:08,565 --> 01:01:09,998
Do you
remember how to do this?

1368
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,401
Yeah, is it kind of like riding
a bike, or what?

1369
01:01:12,403 --> 01:01:14,903
Riding a bike.

1370
01:01:14,905 --> 01:01:17,172
Oh my god!
You just threw your voice!

1371
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:19,708
No, no!

1372
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,744
Well, I don't do monologues.

1373
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:25,647
- Jesse to Braxton.
- Braxton to Jessee.

1374
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:31,186
- Jesse to Braxton.
- Braxton to Jesse, hello?

1375
01:01:32,423 --> 01:01:37,959
<i>Our first finalist is Delilah,
dancing to... Slave!</i>

1376
01:01:37,961 --> 01:01:41,697
I'm sure Emerald is loving
that.

1377
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:43,632
Are they a thing?

1378
01:01:43,634 --> 01:01:46,935
Delilah's the puppet,
Emerald's the strings,

1379
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:50,672
literally and legally.
He's Delilah's agent.

1380
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:53,875
Hot Hollywood gossip, but you
didn't hear that from me.

1381
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:56,745
Stay out of their way.
Delilah needs to win this title tonight.

1382
01:01:56,747 --> 01:02:01,116
Thinks it's gonna to get her talk
show picked up by a network.

1383
01:02:04,154 --> 01:02:06,788
How long have you known
Emerald?

1384
01:02:08,025 --> 01:02:11,860
A year or so.
She's pretty new to the scene.

1385
01:02:12,496 --> 01:02:14,563
Where are you from, honey?

1386
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:16,198
Arizona.

1387
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:18,533
Of course.

1388
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:21,870
and what are you running from?

1389
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,239
Nothing.

1390
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,875
This is a long way from
Arizona.

1391
01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:29,511
Yeah,
I guess so.

1392
01:02:31,115 --> 01:02:33,048
How long have you been
doing this?

1393
01:02:33,684 --> 01:02:34,983
Competing?

1394
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,318
Sure.

1395
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:41,490
Child, I've been performing onstage
since I was about 17 years old.

1396
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:46,161
My mom accepted me as is,
my dad... didn't.

1397
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:49,598
So, after he moved out,

1398
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:52,934
Lucious moved in and I came
out.

1399
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:55,137
Junior year of high school.

1400
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:57,105
What does your puppet do?

1401
01:02:57,641 --> 01:03:00,475
Lolly?
We sing duets.

1402
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:04,246
Now is it hard to talk and sing
through your mouth like that?

1403
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:06,615
Not once you get the hang of
it.

1404
01:03:06,884 --> 01:03:08,683
It's actually kind of nice
sometimes.

1405
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:11,186
Being able to say whatever you
want.

1406
01:03:11,255 --> 01:03:11,853
I heard that!

1407
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:13,388
<i>Let's here it for Delilah!</i>

1408
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:15,791
<i>- Our second finalist is Ginger.
- Yay!</i>

1409
01:03:15,793 --> 01:03:17,926
Work it out, Ginger!
Yes!

1410
01:03:17,928 --> 01:03:21,029
- Let them have it!
- What is your talent!

1411
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:23,698
I salsa dance.

1412
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,501
- Oh!
- But, I'm not dancing tonight

1413
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:28,470
because I have a bad ankle.

1414
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:30,539
But, what if they call your
name?

1415
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:31,873
They won't.

1416
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:33,542
I already told them.

1417
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:36,812
I'm just wearing this because
it's comfortable.

1418
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:38,513
I made it myself.

1419
01:03:38,515 --> 01:03:40,048
You make costumes?

1420
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,884
Day job.
I work in theater.

1421
01:03:42,886 --> 01:03:45,654
Wait, so are you out
of the competition, then?

1422
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:48,256
Most of us aren't here to win
a crown.

1423
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:49,157
Gazelle just likes to sing.

1424
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:53,061
Sunshine is an insurance broker
that lives in the valley.

1425
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:55,230
For some of us, it's a
platform.

1426
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:59,000
For all of us, it is an art
form.

1427
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:02,804
A way of feeling beautiful.

1428
01:04:03,207 --> 01:04:04,472
So, you don't care about the
money?

1429
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:09,277
Oh honey, I stopped leanin' on
the green a long time ago.

1430
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:10,512
You know what they say.

1431
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:14,783
The love of money is the root
of all evils.

1432
01:04:14,785 --> 01:04:16,251
That is true.

1433
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:19,988
But tonight,
I could really use the money.

1434
01:04:21,892 --> 01:04:24,492
And, what would you do with it?

1435
01:04:25,796 --> 01:04:27,495
Something important.

1436
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:29,398
Hmm.

1437
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:35,203
Well, Arizona,
good luck to you.

1438
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,038
I need to reapply.

1439
01:04:37,474 --> 01:04:40,108
Arizona?
They're looking for you.

1440
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:47,048
Slay them sister!
Slay them!

1441
01:04:48,986 --> 01:04:50,285

No!

1484
01:07:59,209 --> 01:08:00,675
I have it on video.

1485
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:02,644
Delilah, tame yourself!

1486
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:04,312
Delilah!

1487
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:05,780
Back.
Off!

1488
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,315
She ain't no drag queen.

1489
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:08,783
What are you saying?

1490
01:08:08,785 --> 01:08:10,652
I'm saying she is a she!

1491
01:08:10,654 --> 01:08:13,421
Emerald just told me she works
with her husband.

1492
01:08:14,091 --> 01:08:14,589
What?

1493
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,925
Is that true, Arizona?

1494
01:08:17,094 --> 01:08:18,726
And she stole my gloves.

1495
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:23,164
Ladies, meet Miss Rose Raynes,
aka Miss Arizona.

1496
01:08:23,567 --> 01:08:25,867
And now, why you got to come
invade our show?

1497
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:28,036
No woman's stealing my show!

1498
01:08:28,038 --> 01:08:29,404
Wait.
Stop.

1499
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,207
She did it for me.

1500
01:08:32,409 --> 01:08:34,609
My ex-husband did this,

1501
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:37,112
and he also shipped my kids off
to Kentucky and

1502
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:39,447
if we don't get there before
he does tonight,

1503
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,483
I may never see them again.

1504
01:08:41,485 --> 01:08:43,785
So, please.

1505
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:46,654
What does this have to do
with that?

1506
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:47,755
Okay?

1507
01:08:47,858 --> 01:08:49,836
Because we needed the money to
get there.

1508
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:52,660
That's all!
And we just thought Miss Arizona could win.

1509
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:53,428
No offense, y'all.

1510
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:55,296
No offense, y'all,
but there's

1511
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:57,999
a whole lot of other ways to
make a little bit of money.

1512
01:08:58,001 --> 01:09:00,602
Okay!?

1513
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:03,238
You know what?
You're right, and we tried.

1514
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:06,007
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to take anything from you.

1515
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:09,077
I was...
I was just trying to help.

1516
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:13,481
Come on, let's go.

1517
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:15,884
Stop!

1518
01:09:15,952 --> 01:09:18,653
You're not going anywhere,
until you've got your money.

1519
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:20,021
Her money?

1520
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:23,124
- She can't compete!
- And, who are you?

1521
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,061
Why are you here?
Why are we all here?

1522
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,130
This is not about winning.

1523
01:09:30,901 --> 01:09:32,100
- Destiny.
- Yes?

1524
01:09:32,102 --> 01:09:35,270
Your sequined outfit costs
twice as much as this prize.

1525
01:09:35,272 --> 01:09:36,838
Well, that is true,
I mean, but really.

1526
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,440
We're here being true
to who we are,

1527
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:42,911
which most of the world
doesn't want us to be.

1528
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:47,582
So, if we're going to continue
to demand love,

1529
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:50,518
then we need to start giving
it, girls.

1530
01:09:51,454 --> 01:09:52,520
Okay?

1531
01:09:53,089 --> 01:09:56,157
I, for one, don't think that
what Miss Arizona is doing

1532
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:57,725
is really all that bad.

1533
01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:58,860
Me, neither!

1534
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:02,197
Well, I do!
And I'm telling Braxton!

1535
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:04,032
Miss Thing?

1536
01:10:04,267 --> 01:10:05,300
You tell Braxton,

1537
01:10:05,302 --> 01:10:07,702
and I will show him the video
that Miss Ginger just took

1538
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:10,405
of what you did to Miss
Arizona's personal property,

1539
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:13,741
to the cop that's out in the audience.

1540
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:16,377
Two different angles!

1541
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:19,447
He's not here to do the YMCA.

1542
01:10:19,449 --> 01:10:21,182
Oh, come on...

1543
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:36,397
You know, I wore this dress
when I won Miss Arizona.

1544
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,800
It's okay, Sweetheart.

1545
01:10:38,802 --> 01:10:40,868
You can borrow anything of
mine.

1546
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:41,302
Anything!

1547
01:10:41,304 --> 01:10:43,771
Girl, what's she supposed to do
with, use that as a tent?

1548
01:10:43,773 --> 01:10:44,872
Oh, step down!

1549
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:47,275
I made half of your costumes.
Okay?

1550
01:10:47,277 --> 01:10:49,544
- That's gonna require a lot of stuffing.
- Oh, please.

1551
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:51,379
I'm just saying,
she got to stuff a lot.

1552
01:10:51,381 --> 01:10:53,648
Look, we can piece something
together.

1553
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:55,149
You're gonna be fine.

1554
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:03,591
I... is your radio on?

1555
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,428
The jig is up, Rose.

1556
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,830
Or what, Gary?

1557
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:11,165
The way I see it you have
a lot more to lose than I do

1558
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:12,900
with our little run in,
tonight.

1559
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:14,135
Oh, Sweetheart!

1560
01:11:14,137 --> 01:11:16,838
Before you bring this up
at the company picnic,

1561
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,805
take a look out there.

1562
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:21,776
There's Cliff, there's Emily,
and there's your little friend.

1563
01:11:22,012 --> 01:11:23,177
- Vicki?
- Yeah, Vicki.

1564
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:26,648
Vicki knows, Bev knows,
everybody knows.

1565
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:29,217
I know how to take
care of the clients.

1566
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:30,285
Now, look.

1567
01:11:30,287 --> 01:11:32,186
I don't know who put you up to
this charade,

1568
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:34,422
and I don't know what you're
looking for,

1569
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:36,624
but you're not gonna find it
here.

1570
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:39,027
So...

1571
01:11:39,095 --> 01:11:43,264
I think it's time for you to
go home, Rose.

1572
01:11:43,266 --> 01:11:45,199
It's past your bedtime.

1573
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:48,936
Eight hundred dollars
for me to drop out.

1574
01:11:48,938 --> 01:11:50,605
That's easy.

1575
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:53,374
I'll wire it to you in the
morning.

1576
01:11:53,376 --> 01:11:54,909
<i>Each finalist will join me</i>

1577
01:11:54,911 --> 01:11:58,246
<i>onstage to answer one last
question.</i>

1578
01:11:58,248 --> 01:12:00,214
That will be too late.

1579
01:12:00,216 --> 01:12:02,216
Good luck to Delilah.

1580
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,721
I'll be right back.

1581
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:08,856
And, audience!
That's when we throw to you.

1582
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:10,358
Her kids are going to be gone
in she doesn't get there.

1583
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,995
- I mean, why would I dress in drag for no reason?
- I know, I can help you.

1584
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:15,163
- I'm going to help you.
- Yeah?

1585
01:12:15,165 --> 01:12:16,497
Yes.
I got this.

1586
01:12:16,599 --> 01:12:19,200
Our first finalist is like a
cool glass of sweet tea.

1587
01:12:19,202 --> 01:12:21,569
Miss Ginger!

1588
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:23,338
Hello, Miss Ginger.

1589
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:24,605
Tell us.

1590
01:12:24,607 --> 01:12:27,842
What does it mean to you to be
beautiful?

1591
01:12:28,278 --> 01:12:29,510
Thank you.

1592
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:35,283
To me, beauty means finding the
light in all of the darkness.

1593
01:12:35,285 --> 01:12:36,818
I may never be the pretty one,

1594
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:39,354
but I will always be the
beautiful one.

1595
01:12:40,757 --> 01:12:45,293
Our next finalist, the one and
only, Delilah!

1596
01:12:45,295 --> 01:12:48,363
Hello, Miss Delilah.

1597
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:51,599
Delilah,

1598
01:12:51,835 --> 01:12:54,869
what does it mean to you to be
beautiful?

1599
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,638
Thank you, esteemed judges and
panel.

1600
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:01,075
Being beautiful to me means
taking time to honor

1601
01:13:01,077 --> 01:13:03,044
the inner queen you are.

1602
01:13:03,046 --> 01:13:05,146
And I have a big inner queen
in me.

1603
01:13:07,684 --> 01:13:08,316
What is it?

1604
01:13:08,318 --> 01:13:09,584
It's my husband's best
friend,

1605
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:12,220
and he owes me a huge favor.

1606
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:14,622
Arizona!

1607
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:19,093
- <i>Arizona?</i>
- It's in here somewhere.

1608
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:22,530
- They're calling my name.
- Just, just go.

1609
01:13:22,532 --> 01:13:24,699
Arizona, they need you.

1610
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:29,871
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1611
01:13:29,873 --> 01:13:30,538
Nice dress!

1612
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:32,907
All right, Arizona.
Let's get serious.

1613
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:33,875
You got to tell us.

1614
01:13:33,877 --> 01:13:37,712
What does it mean to you to be
beautiful?

1615
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:45,153
Go on, girl!

1616
01:13:46,723 --> 01:13:48,055
I was born into a world

1617
01:13:48,057 --> 01:13:50,858
where I was trained from the
time I was a little girl

1618
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:53,761
to sit still and look pretty.

1619
01:13:54,297 --> 01:13:55,062
But, as I've grown,

1620
01:13:55,064 --> 01:13:59,000
I've learned that outer beauty
can hide a hollow shell.

1621
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,068
Friendship.

1622
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:04,405
Being kind.
Helping others.

1623
01:14:05,175 --> 01:14:07,475
Looking out for those
who need us most.

1624
01:14:07,477 --> 01:14:09,577
And doing whatever it takes

1625
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:11,245
to be there for them.

1626
01:14:12,215 --> 01:14:13,915
That's what makes us beautiful.

1627
01:14:15,552 --> 01:14:17,652
Arizona, please clarify.

1628
01:14:17,654 --> 01:14:19,954
You said "since I was a little
girl?"

1629
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:21,789
If that statement is true,

1630
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:24,358
technically, you'd be
disqualified.

1631
01:14:24,594 --> 01:14:27,528
- Disqualify her!
- Go enter Miss America!

1632
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:28,696
She did the right paperwork!

1633
01:14:28,698 --> 01:14:31,065
She checked all the right
boxes!

1634
01:14:32,535 --> 01:14:33,768
Arizona.

1635
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:35,036
What's up?

1636
01:14:35,038 --> 01:14:38,105
Are you a female, or what?
Come straight.

1637
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:40,741
Yes, I am.

1638
01:14:42,178 --> 01:14:43,110
Okay.

1639
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:45,112
That disqualifies you from
the competition.

1640
01:14:45,114 --> 01:14:47,048
Now, we'll fill that final
position

1641
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:48,316
with our next finalist,

1642
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:51,786
Destiny, who will now
show us her talent.

1643
01:14:52,422 --> 01:14:54,322
And she looks ready.

1644
01:14:54,924 --> 01:14:55,456
All right.

1645
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,058
It's about damned time.

1646
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:59,126
Who's ready for some Hot Stuff?

1647
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:01,829
I got all the hot stuff you
need, okay?

1648
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:10,872
<i>♪ Sittin' here, eatin' my
heart out waitin' ♪</i>

1649
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:14,108
<i>♪ I'm waitin' for some lover
to call ♪</i>

1650
01:15:31,294 --> 01:15:34,662
<i>The winner is... Miss Delilah!</i>

1651
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:37,765
Whoa!
Get back here, Arizona!

1652
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:39,300
That should have been me up
there!

1653
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:40,167
You took my spot!

1654
01:15:40,169 --> 01:15:42,169
I didn't mean to take anything
from you.

1655
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:43,638
This was supposed to be our
night!

1656
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:46,374
There are hundreds of nights
for girls like you.

1657
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,209
Hey, hey, hey!

1658
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:49,544
Back off!
Hey!

1659
01:15:49,546 --> 01:15:50,878
Go on, Ariziona!
Get out of here!

1660
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,214
- Don't you touch my white girl!
- Go on, Arizona!

1661
01:15:53,216 --> 01:15:54,715
Get out of here!
Go!

1662
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:00,187
Kick her ass,
sea bass.

1663
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:02,189
Touch her again!
Touch her again!

1664
01:16:02,191 --> 01:16:05,192
You don't want this!
You... Where's Rose?

1665
01:16:05,194 --> 01:16:06,427
Where's Rose at?

1666
01:16:06,429 --> 01:16:07,762
I knew she was a
girl

1667
01:16:07,764 --> 01:16:09,196
when she walked up in
here, girl, I told y'all.

1668
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:11,832
- Y'all didn't believe me.
- Nobody could ever believe you.

1669
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:12,567
All you do is lie.

1670
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:15,369
- The devil is a lie.
- That's how I got in this mess.

1671
01:16:15,371 --> 01:16:17,505
I can't believe you
got into that mess.

1672
01:16:17,507 --> 01:16:22,343
- Must have took a whole bucket of Crisco.
- Somebody had to do it, okay?

1673
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,746
I have to pull over.

1674
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:30,818
Hey, hey, you did your best.
It's okay.

1675
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:33,454
Yeah, you probably wouldn't
have made the plane anyway.

1676
01:16:33,456 --> 01:16:36,223
No, it's not that.

1677
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:38,926
That was the weirdest
night of my life.

1678
01:16:39,996 --> 01:16:43,097
When that song came on!

1679
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:47,134
"Man, I feel like a woman!"

1680
01:16:47,136 --> 01:16:48,536
When I woke up this morning,

1681
01:16:48,538 --> 01:16:52,340
I never thought my day would
end up here.

1682
01:16:55,445 --> 01:16:57,745
But I'm really glad it did.

1683
01:16:58,815 --> 01:16:59,815
Yeah.

1684
01:16:59,849 --> 01:17:02,883
I wish you'd won the
money, though.

1685
01:17:02,885 --> 01:17:04,085
No!

1686
01:17:04,087 --> 01:17:04,719
No, we did!

1687
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:08,255
We won, we definitely won!
I forgot to tell you.

1688
01:17:08,257 --> 01:17:10,024
We are getting you to Kentucky.

1689
01:17:10,893 --> 01:17:11,959
What?

1690
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:14,128
- What?
- Yes!

1691
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:28,275
Yay!
You found it.

1692
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:30,611
- I tried calling you.
- I must have left my phone.

1693
01:17:30,613 --> 01:17:32,980
It's okay.
Everything is set.

1694
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:34,882
Come on.
Watch your step.

1695
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:39,220
The big planes are with the
rest of the agency in New York.

1696
01:17:39,222 --> 01:17:41,255
But, this one can get her to
Louisville nonstop.

1697
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:43,891
The pilot just can't get here
till 7 a.m.

1698
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,793
But, there's a diner down
the street

1699
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:47,962
if you guys want to
kill some time.

1700
01:17:47,964 --> 01:17:48,763
Yeah,
that's perfect!

1701
01:17:48,765 --> 01:17:50,431
OK, now I've got to get back
to the club

1702
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:52,400
because I literally left
everybody there.

1703
01:17:52,402 --> 01:17:53,901
But, I'll be back here in the
morning.

1704
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:56,470
- Thank you so much.
- Of course.

1705
01:18:04,914 --> 01:18:07,014
Best burger I ever ate.

1706
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:13,421
So, you think you'd really
work at a place like this?

1707
01:18:13,623 --> 01:18:14,355
Yes.

1708
01:18:14,424 --> 01:18:16,090
Why is that so funny?

1709
01:18:16,092 --> 01:18:18,025
I don't know, because you'd
have to touch

1710
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:19,994
things like, butter.

1711
01:18:19,996 --> 01:18:21,862
You've all told me that you've
worked in diners.

1712
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,665
I don't see why the idea of
me working in a place

1713
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:26,300
like this is so funny.

1714
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:28,703
You know they make you wear
polyester.

1715
01:18:28,838 --> 01:18:30,871
And rubber shoes.

1716
01:18:35,778 --> 01:18:36,610
Rubber shoes!

1717
01:18:36,612 --> 01:18:39,647
- Shoes!
- Rubber shoes!

1718
01:18:39,816 --> 01:18:41,449
You too, huh?

1719
01:18:41,451 --> 01:18:43,684
I've never had a real job, and
I just,

1720
01:18:43,686 --> 01:18:45,953
I don't know,
I think it might be fun.

1721
01:18:46,155 --> 01:18:47,521
It really isn't.

1722
01:18:49,092 --> 01:18:50,257
But, why a diner?

1723
01:18:50,259 --> 01:18:52,927
Growing up, I was never allowed

1724
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:54,829
to eat food like this as
a kid.

1725
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:56,363
My mom had a sign
in the kitchen:

1726
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:58,466
"Nothing tastes as good as
thin feels."

1727
01:18:58,468 --> 01:19:01,535
But, all the people on TV
and commercials and stuff,

1728
01:19:01,537 --> 01:19:05,339
whenever they eat food like
this they always seem so...

1729
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:06,907
happy.

1730
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,576
I don't know, I think it might
be fun

1731
01:19:08,578 --> 01:19:11,245
to serve people all this happy
grease.

1732
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:13,748
You know what else is fun?

1733
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:14,982
What?

1734
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:16,717
Eating it.

1735
01:19:19,589 --> 01:19:21,021
Here.
For you.

1736
01:19:21,023 --> 01:19:22,189
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no no.

1737
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:24,525
One little ole bite.
It's not gonna kill you.

1738
01:19:24,527 --> 01:19:27,628
- I'm fine.
- You'll still be a negative size 2.

1739
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:29,330
Stop.
I'm fine.

1740
01:19:29,332 --> 01:19:30,231
- Do it.
- Do it.

1741
01:19:30,233 --> 01:19:32,466
- Do it, do it, do it, do it!
- Do it, do it, do it, do it!

1742
01:19:32,468 --> 01:19:34,835
Guys!

1743
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:37,772
Fine, fine!
Alright, fine!

1744
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:39,907
I will take a bite.

1745
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:46,747
Here we go.

1746
01:19:52,255 --> 01:19:54,522
- It's good.
- Just good?

1747
01:19:56,325 --> 01:19:57,491
It's amazing!

1748
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:01,796
- That was easy.
- This is so good!

1749
01:20:06,068 --> 01:20:07,268
Oh.

1750
01:20:07,537 --> 01:20:09,804
I don't know if I can swallow
this.

1751
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:11,238
It's delicious!

1752
01:20:11,808 --> 01:20:13,641
Your mother would be proud.

1753
01:20:17,046 --> 01:20:18,546
Beautiful!

1754
01:20:19,215 --> 01:20:22,049
I'll take this whenever you
guys are ready.

1755
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:31,926
- It's sixty-two dollars!
- What?

1756
01:20:31,928 --> 01:20:36,797
Jasmine, you said these burgers
were four bucks each?

1757
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,465
What the?

1758
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:41,135
On the kid's menu!

1759
01:20:41,137 --> 01:20:42,137
What?

1760
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:49,143
Oh, look at Miss America.

1761
01:20:49,212 --> 01:20:50,945
Living the dream.

1762
01:21:03,226 --> 01:21:05,125
I hope you enjoy.

1763
01:21:05,127 --> 01:21:07,361
It is so good.

1764
01:21:12,268 --> 01:21:13,834
Hey!
Tyhefe!

1765
01:21:13,836 --> 01:21:18,505
That dude owe me money!
Don't you drive off Tyhefe!

1766
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:20,474
I done told you!

1767
01:21:20,476 --> 01:21:22,276
I told you I'd be lookin' for
your butt!

1768
01:21:22,278 --> 01:21:24,011
Take me to the ATM
right now!

1769
01:21:24,013 --> 01:21:26,847
Take me to the ATM, Tyhefe.

1770
01:21:26,849 --> 01:21:27,615
Is she gonna be alright?

1771
01:21:27,617 --> 01:21:30,384
There's one
right across the street.

1772
01:21:30,853 --> 01:21:33,287
Jasmine's always gonna be
alright.

1773
01:21:45,635 --> 01:21:48,235
That's one way to get to
Kentucky.

1774
01:21:49,005 --> 01:21:51,238
How you doing, Sammy?

1775
01:21:51,607 --> 01:21:53,140
I'm kind of scared.

1776
01:21:53,643 --> 01:21:55,709
Oh, baby.
You got us.

1777
01:21:56,345 --> 01:21:58,379
I don't want to go back.

1778
01:21:58,915 --> 01:22:00,347
He knows.

1779
01:22:00,349 --> 01:22:03,918
No, no, if our location gets
out, New Haven will move us.

1780
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:05,419
Hey, Rose.

1781
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:08,155
How many people will fit in
that plane?

1782
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:10,591
I don't know?
Four or five?

1783
01:22:11,694 --> 01:22:13,460
What if we all go?

1784
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:17,031
Afraid, I can't cross state
lines, right now, ladies, but...

1785
01:22:17,033 --> 01:22:17,531
I wish I could.

1786
01:22:17,533 --> 01:22:20,567
I have to pick up my son in
three hours.

1787
01:22:22,872 --> 01:22:24,838
Can I come?

1788
01:22:25,474 --> 01:22:28,108
Oh my gosh, that would be so
great.

1789
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:29,510
Get a fresh start?

1790
01:22:29,512 --> 01:22:32,446
Well, what about your things?
Should we go get them?

1791
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:33,881
I have my ID.

1792
01:22:39,221 --> 01:22:41,689

- Yeah.

1826
01:25:15,544 --> 01:25:17,711
Yeah!
We built a fort on the trampoline

1827
01:25:17,713 --> 01:25:21,014
and stayed up all night long
until like, midnight.

1828

Oh, I understand.

1845
01:26:05,728 --> 01:26:07,060
Thank you, bye-bye.

1846
01:26:08,063 --> 01:26:09,563
Oh!
Mr. Raynes.

1847
01:26:09,565 --> 01:26:13,133
I tried to reach you, but I
couldn't get past your...

1848
01:26:13,135 --> 01:26:13,934
assistant.

1849
01:26:13,936 --> 01:26:16,737
I'm afraid Mr. Murdock is
unable to consult

1850
01:26:16,739 --> 01:26:20,641
with you because he's already
consulted with your...

1851
01:26:20,943 --> 01:26:22,943
Mrs. Raynes.

1852
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,180
Rose hired Murdock?

1853
01:26:26,182 --> 01:26:27,848
Well, not officially yet,

1854
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:30,184
but they did have a
consultation,

1855
01:26:30,186 --> 01:26:32,352
which creates a conflict.

1856
01:26:33,622 --> 01:26:34,054
Okay.

1857
01:26:34,056 --> 01:26:36,256
Okay, they?
Who is they?

1858
01:26:36,258 --> 01:26:37,357
Oh, dear.

1859
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:39,526
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to say.

1860
01:26:42,631 --> 01:26:43,764
Right.

1861
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:44,898
<i>I understand, but Mrs. Raynes</i>

1862
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:45,832
<i>already came in.</i>

1863
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:46,567
Yeah.
Yeah.

1864
01:26:46,569 --> 01:26:48,535
Let me guess.
For a "consultation."

1865
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,304
Well, I can tell you right now,

1866
01:26:50,306 --> 01:26:52,406
she's not hiring your firm
either so,

1867
01:26:52,408 --> 01:26:54,341
why don't you go ahead and
tell me

1868
01:26:54,343 --> 01:26:56,843
who's the douche bag she came
in with?

1869
01:26:56,845 --> 01:26:58,312
<i>No.
That was no douche bag.</i>

1870
01:26:58,314 --> 01:27:01,114
<i>That firecracker was her life
coach.</i>

1871
01:27:02,351 --> 01:27:05,252
I didn't think I could ever
love you again.

1872
01:27:05,254 --> 01:27:07,221
After all we've been through.

1873
01:27:08,524 --> 01:27:10,390
But then I realized...

1874
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:12,526
it was all my fault.

1875
01:27:12,995 --> 01:27:15,896
I made you react the way you
did.

1876
01:27:16,599 --> 01:27:18,298
When I set your car on fire,

1877
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:21,868
I forgot your brother
was hog tied in the trunk.

1878
01:27:22,171 --> 01:27:23,171
Rose!

1879
01:27:23,205 --> 01:27:25,672
Hey, realtor's here.
You ready to sign?

1880
01:27:25,874 --> 01:27:26,607
- Yes.
- All right.

1881
01:27:26,609 --> 01:27:27,608

beds.

1882
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:29,209

1883
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:30,310

1884
01:27:30,312 --> 01:27:31,979
She has three kids coming with
her.

1885
01:27:31,981 --> 01:27:32,879
Yeah.
Got it.

1886
01:27:32,881 --> 01:27:33,714
See you, Boss.

1887
01:27:33,716 --> 01:27:35,616
- Bye, Bigs.

Sawyer.

1889
01:27:40,556 --> 01:27:42,522
Are you sure I'm right for this
part?

1890
01:27:42,524 --> 01:27:43,790
This woman is kind of a
psychopath.

1891
01:27:43,792 --> 01:27:45,559
What are you talking about?
I don't see it that way.

1892
01:27:45,561 --> 01:27:49,196

1899
01:27:59,341 --> 01:28:01,508
