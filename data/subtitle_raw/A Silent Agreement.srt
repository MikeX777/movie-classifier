Okay.

It moans passionately.

34
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:10,775
It aches, arches and breaks.

35
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:17,224
It groans compassionately.

36
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:19,568
My heart!

37
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:22,857
My love!

38
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:27,531
At the finish, as it was at the start!

39
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:39,224
Just get out! Just get away from me! Just get! Get!

40
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:42,684
2 To get distance from you &

41
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:46,819
What the hell were you thinking?

42
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:48,147
Are you serious?

43
00:02:48,226 --> 00:02:49,398
"Groans compassicnately"?

44
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:53,690
- No, what it's supposed to mean is --
- It doesn't mean anything, Blake.

45
00:02:53,976 --> 00:02:55,603
Now, just get out. Just get out!

46
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:58,524
I have a show to run, get cut!

47
00:03:00,976 --> 00:03:01,977
Reuben!

48
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:03,972
Get your arse out there!

49
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:14,611
That was Blake Rhodes with his rendition of...

50
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:17,602
...Hate Attack.

51
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:24,442
Coming up next; we have "Feathers
From A Thousand Li Away".

52
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:27,712
Apassage from "The Joy Luck
Club" written by Amy Tan,

53
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:30,149
and performed by Reuben Heywood.

54
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:38,527
Fuck!

55
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:45,062
The... The cld woman remembered a ss - a swan
she bought years ago in -in-in-in -in

56
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:47,921
- in Shanghai for a foolish sum.

57
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,770
"This bird," boasted the market
vendor "was once a duck..."

58
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:55,815
"...that stretched its neck out in hopes
of - of someday becoming a goose."

59
00:03:56,566 --> 00:04:00,104
...And now look, it - it - it
-it's too beautiful to eat."

60
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:05,345
So the woman a-a-and the swan
sa-sa-sa-sailed across an ocean...

61
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:11,568
...m-many thousands of Li wide,
str-stre-stretching their necks toward America.

62
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,211
On her journey, the woman coced to the swan;

63
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:18,059
"In America, I will have daughter just like me"

64
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:22,310
"but over there no one will say her worth is
measured by the loudness of her hushand's belch."

65
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:27,436
"Over there she will be too full of Coca-Cola
to ever swallow any sorrow and over there -- "

66
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:36,727
"80 - s0 the woman a-a-and the - a-and the sw -
and the swan sailed across an ocean..."

67
00:04:49,816 --> 00:04:52,069
[laughter and confused chatter]

68
00:04:58,146 --> 00:05:00,672
Uh, apologies, ladies and gentlemen.

69
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:03,314
We appear to be having a
technical issue backstage.

70
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,461
Uh, but please remain in your seats,

71
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:08,320
our next performer will be on momentarily.

72
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:11,859
(muttering) What the fuck is going on?

73
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:15,432
L can't interpret under these conditions!

74
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,893
The last line he said needed subtitles!

75
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:19,591
I can't understand a word he says!

76
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:21,017
This is amateur theatre!

77
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:23,017
It's supposedtobea-a-a-a-a-a-a..

78
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:24,346
...asafeplace for somebody
who has a speech impediment!

79
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:26,142
I'm sorry, Reuben, but that's simply not true.

80
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:29,649
What about Blake? He was unintelligible!

81
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:31,301
At least he was speaking English.

82
00:05:31,316 --> 00:05:32,306
L 'am speaking English!

83
00:05:32,316 --> 00:05:34,728
I've your script in front of me and
I could barely understand you.

84
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:35,977
Can you understand me now?

85
00:05:36,526 --> 00:05:38,221
He was speaking English the whole time.

86
00:05:38,436 --> 00:05:40,973
I don't know why you had to cancel
his performance halfway through.

87
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:42,721
I could lip-read him the whole time.

88
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:44,091
Oh, that's not what you said befere!

89
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:48,191
Look! I have a show to run, so just
sort this out amongst yourselves.

90
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:50,392
- What about my play?
- Learn your lines better!

91
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:51,471
L know my lines!

92
00:05:51,526 --> 00:05:52,971
Oh, you could have fooled me!

93
00:05:55,276 --> 00:05:57,608
Um, don't mind her. She's a bit of a linguist.

94
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,602
She has no patience for miscommunication.

95
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:01,898
But you could lip-read my
performance, couldn't you?

96
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:04,108
Um... ll can now.

97
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:05,687
What?

98
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:09,525
Sorry. I just... stretched the truth a little bit.

99
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:12,598
I mean, I can lip-read them, but I
didn't like how they were treating you.

100
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:13,721
I thought I'd help you out a bit.

101
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:17,813
So you couldn't lip-read - you
couldn't lip-read my performance?

102
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:19,607
Sorry.

103
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:21,522
You locked really invested, though.

104
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:24,027
Thanks...

105
00:06:25,606 --> 00:06:27,973
I'm Derek. My sign name is "Derek".

00:06:30,316 --> 00:06:31,852
- Sorry?
- Reuben.

108
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:34,063
Reuben? It's nice to meet you.

109
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,067
Thanks.

110
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:37,477
Um...

111
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:38,777
Wanna get out of here?

112
00:06:39,276 --> 00:06:40,061
What?

113
00:06:40,396 --> 00:06:41,397
Do you want to get out of here?

115
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:10,435
[REUBEN] I don't know to
compete with those people.

116
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,307
Are you lip-reading me?

117
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:16,432
Yeah... Well, I try.

118
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:22,318
Right. Yeah...

119
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:26,685
You know, "a flower; it doesn't think
about competing with its neighbours...

120
00:07:27,816 --> 00:07:29,068
...itjust blooms."

121
00:07:32,606 --> 00:07:38,602
It's... hard... to... bloom...
when... you... have... a... st--

122
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:41,602
No, no, no! Tell me.

123
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:44,777
Try.

124
00:07:47,186 --> 00:07:48,187
Okay.

125
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:52,937
A stutter is like, um...

126
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:55,688
...my words are, um.

127
00:07:58,396 --> 00:07:59,397
...fabric...

128
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:01,858
...going through a machine.

129
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,673
And at random times, it just gets... jammed.

130
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,973
And it misses stitches.

131
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:10,607
Right...

132
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:14,230
I think that's the same for me when
I'm trying to learn new words...

133
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:16,722
...except that it's more of a, um...

134
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:18,778
...hearing impediment.

135
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:21,357
Um...

136
00:08:21,816 --> 00:08:23,432
Are you profoundly deaf?

137
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,029
Yeah. Profoundly deaf.

138
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:26,107
Wow.

139
00:08:27,066 --> 00:08:28,773
Yeah, it doesn't stop me, though.

140
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:31,820
L mean, I'm doing a political
science degree at uni right now.

141
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:33,357
That's impressive.

142
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:40,939
Yeah. Who else better than me to lead
the LGBTQIA and deaf rights rallies?

143
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:43,392
But do those overlap?

144
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:45,277
They do for me.

145
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,570
Yeah. The arts is just a...

146
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:50,278
...it's a form of therapy.

147
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:54,690
I think it's a way of helping people
regulate their mood and expressions.

148
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:56,317
It's healthy.

149
00:08:58,646 --> 00:08:59,932
Doesn't help me with my stutter.

150
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,067
You know...

151
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:06,393
You can do anything if it has purpose.

152
00:09:12,276 --> 00:09:16,634
I'm - I'm writing a play called
"The Burden of Being Me", it's...

153
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:20,480
...kinda based on my life and I think it has purpose.

154
00:09:21,276 --> 00:09:26,851
But I take it up to the theatre and they won't
show any part of it. It's discrimination.

155
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:31,821
Egotistical thespians and
their overwritten musings.

156
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:34,729
Big deal. You don't need them for your validation.

157
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:36,817
Don't I?

158
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,604
Not if you say your work has much purpose.

00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:45,567

00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:05,971

Have you always been deaf?

Yep. Have you always had a stutter?

No, actually... Um...

178
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:37,228
I was an only child.

179
00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:40,973
Are you...? Are you still an only child?

180
00:11:41,226 --> 00:11:42,227
Yes.

181
00:11:42,646 --> 00:11:48,972
But, um, when I was 3, uh, my mother
had twins and, uh, they were stillborn.

182
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:51,386
Oh my God.

183
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:52,522
I'm sorry to hear that.

184
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,774
She was pretty cold towards me after that.

185
00:11:56,936 --> 00:11:57,937
Towards everyone, really.

186
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:02,901
I don't think anyone... feels rejection
as much as a small child, you know?

187
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:05,647
What about your dad?

188
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,604
He's a math teacher and she's a proofreader.

189
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:11,939
So they're very astute in finding fault and...

190
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:14,642
...taking it upon themselves to fix things.

191
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:17,319
That would be you, I take it?

192
00:12:19,186 --> 00:12:20,972
Didn't get much better after that. Um...

193
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:23,723
I wore glasses, had a stammer, so...

194
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:27,856
...I was bullied a lot at school and
wasn't one to really fit in, you know?

195
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:31,648
What's wrong?

196
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:37,978
Don't take it the wrong way...

197
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:40,068
...but, I find that when...

198
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,188
...guys share their sob stories on the first date...

199
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:44,817
...it's ared flag.

200
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:46,602
Itisn't a sob story.

201
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:51,531
Like you being deaf. I have had to cvercome
and it's made me who I am.

202
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:55,399
Yeah, but there's a difference between
fitting in and belonging.

203
00:13:02,606 --> 00:13:04,062
What's your sob story?

204
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:09,461
I need you to look at me so I can lip-read you.

205
00:13:09,476 --> 00:13:11,319
Oh, sorry. Um...

206
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:13,899
What's your sob story?

207
00:13:18,436 --> 00:13:20,063
Not really a sob story...

208
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:21,527
. but...

209
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:23,273
...Well, I...

210
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:25,221
...bulked up just a little bit.

211
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:29,025
Just to, you know, get attention from guys.

212
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:30,886
Yeah...

213
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:33,604
Hearing guys really don't know
how to flirt with deaf guys.

214
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:39,471
They just think sign language is all
"ugh, lock at me, I'm a spastic!"

215
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:41,227
You know, but...

216
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:46,031
It's amazing that you can create
meaning cut of these hand-shapes.

217
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:48,181
Like, if you put it here;

218
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:50,683
That's "silly". Or, "fuckwit".

219
00:13:51,276 --> 00:13:53,108
Or "available".

220
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:54,978
Or "stubborn”.

221
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:56,527
It's amazing.

222
00:13:57,646 --> 00:14:02,231
So, silly... available... stubborn.

223
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:04,773
I'm all three of those things!

224
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:06,397
Convenient!

225
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:10,434
Yeah... No one has ever really
learnt my language, so...

226
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:12,147


227
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:15,228
L know what it's like to be misunderstood.

228
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,359
So, how doc you find the
confidence to go intoc politics?

229
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:21,477
Hm? Sorry?

230
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:24,274
How do you find the confidence to go into politics?

231
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:27,972
Well, I find that...

232
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:33,612
...if you've got something to say and nc cne's
listening, change the way you campaign.

233
00:14:34,226 --> 00:14:35,227
What do you mean?

234
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:39,401
Well, that play you're doing;
Why not turn it into a film?

235
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:41,641
I can't turn it into a film!

236
00:14:41,646 --> 00:14:43,421
Films cost millions of dollars to make.

237
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:48,351
And who would I get to direct it
and edit it and... l don't know... gaffer it?

238
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:54,811
Well, if you are as motivated
as you say you are, you'll manage.

239
00:14:55,106 --> 00:14:58,132
Yeah. And I've always wanted to do a bit of acting.

240
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:00,524
But I just never had the opportunity.

241
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:02,317
Because you're deaf?

242
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:04,437
Well, it's...

243
00:15:04,896 --> 00:15:09,811
All the... there's no captions or
interpreters at workshops or theatres.

244
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:12,478
And that's a problem because you're deaf?

245
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:17,605
It's because I'm deaf that I
want to doit. I want to try.

246
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:21,274
Then you should.
If I'turn my stage play into afilm...

247
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:23,393
...I'd love to have you as my leading man.

248
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:24,687
Aww.

249
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:26,603
That's sweet of you.

250
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:29,067
Yeah.

251
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:34,059
But... you know, it can't just be the both of us.

252
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,431
All right? So...

253
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:38,358
Get all of this negativity and self-doubt...

254
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:41,684
Cram it into a ball. Cram it tight.

255
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:44,934
Throw it all the way over there.
Make a wish.

256
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:47,279
If you could pick anyone...

257
00:15:47,606 --> 00:15:51,691
...any actor to be in your
leading role, who would it be?

258
00:15:52,776 --> 00:15:54,028
Million dollar question.

259
00:15:58,526 --> 00:15:59,607
Everything...

260
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:01,647
...Is stolen.

261
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:07,014
There is nothing new, there is nothing original...

262
00:16:07,026 --> 00:16:10,132
...there are seven deadly sins,
there are seven days to the week...

263
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:13,013
...and there are seven basic
plot points in storytelling.

264
00:16:13,026 --> 00:16:15,131
Douglas. Seven plots, peints. Go.

265
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:21,142
<i>- Uh... Comedy, tragedy... rags to riches...
- The quest, rebirth, overcoming
the monster and voyage and return.</i>

266
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:24,478
Good. Good... Now...

267
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:30,424
Every story, every idea, is just areactiocntoa
stimulus that comes before it.

268
00:16:30,436 --> 00:16:34,851
Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't,
sometimes they overpower the competition...

269
00:16:34,856 --> 00:16:35,857
However...

270
00:16:37,976 --> 00:16:39,899
When you think about it,

271
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:45,277
there are only so many combinations of notes
that go into making the symphony that...

272
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:48,303
...eventually some tunes start to sound the same.

273
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:51,820
Some stories resemble other
stories with common elements...

274
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:55,685
But, sir, the writer is always
responsible for the manuscript.

275
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:59,218
In the context of film, the
writer always owns the work,

276
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,978
they just sell the rights to film it, don't they?

277
00:17:01,316 --> 00:17:02,317
Hmm.

278
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:06,093
Interesting theory. Let's test it. Let's make a scene!

279
00:17:06,106 --> 00:17:07,096
Okay...

280
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:08,881
- Uh, name? You've got a name of character?
- Geoff.

281
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:11,012
- Geoff, Geoff, Geoff -- what's Geoff doing?

282
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:12,562
Uh, he's in court.

283
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:14,649
- He's in court. Geoff's in court...?
- For manslaughter.

284
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:17,422
Okay, Geoff's in court for
manslaughter. What's the cutcome?

285
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,437
Uh, he gets, uh...

286
00:17:19,276 --> 00:17:20,641
- Executed. Nice.
- Yeah, executed.

287
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:24,111
Lovely. Lovely work. Geoff's in court for
manslaughter and he gets executed.

288
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:26,228
We've created a story. Okay?

289
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:29,069
But with so many people contributing...

290
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,522
...who owns it?

291
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:37,145
That's why you guys are so
important to this industry.

292
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:40,923
You write up the contacts, you draw
up the clear lines of distinction...

293
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:44,190
<i>...between the author and the
production company and above all...</i>

294
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,148
...you protect your own work.

295
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:48,352
- But, sir?
- Gareth.

296
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:51,570
Gareth. How do you know all this? You're an actor.

297
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:56,348
L'am not a producer. I am not a lawyer.

298
00:17:56,356 --> 00:18:00,611
L 'am, however, married to the best
entertainment attorney in Australia.

299
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:04,064
And they say showbiz marriages don't last!

300
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:08,764
Well, here is a clear example of when both parties...

301
00:18:08,776 --> 00:18:13,316
...are passichately respectful
for what a contract represents.

302
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:17,147
All right, moving on...

303
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:28,926

Hey, Lily.

331
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:47,777
Ugh, I'm exhausted.

332
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:50,148
How was your day?

333
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:56,107
Six solid hours, pontificating back my degree toc a
dozen dead-eyed university students...

334
00:20:57,026 --> 00:20:59,643
Not exactly where I thought
I'd find myself at this age.

335
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:04,607
You?

336
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:07,353
Ch, the usual.

337
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,228
Intellectual property.

338
00:21:09,856 --> 00:21:11,358
Copyright infringement.

339
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:15,474
People confusing the role of a
solicitor for that of an attorney.

340
00:21:16,436 --> 00:21:20,282
Same old, same old.

341
00:21:23,396 --> 00:21:25,683
Hm, same cld, same old.
Sounds a bit close to home.

342
00:21:27,816 --> 00:21:31,650
You know, it occurred to me today,
that I was 27 when I got my first AFl award.

343
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:37,141
Best Australian Actor in multiple genres,
year after year and now I've lapped that age and...

344
00:21:38,146 --> 00:21:39,807
...it occurs to me that in your 50s...

345
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:44,071
...the only roles you can count
on getting are the ones that
threaten to muffin-top your belt buckle.

346
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:55,227
You're still all right, mate.

347
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,893
Still geod looking. I love ya.

348
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:05,473
L want to blow your mind.

349
00:22:08,606 --> 00:22:09,687
Look, no, Lily...

350
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:11,971
I'm just not in the mood.

351
00:22:14,316 --> 00:22:16,273
Ch, come on!

352
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:17,437
You promised.

353
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:24,977
Gareth.

354
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:26,647
What?

355
00:22:28,186 --> 00:22:30,393
Gareth, my cycle's been irregular...

356
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,853
- ...more than usual.
- Well, that's a turn-on!

357
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:36,012
"Hey, Honey, I'm staring down
the barrel of menopause...

358
00:22:36,026 --> 00:22:38,313
"...we should be going at it like we're 19 again."

359
00:22:38,396 --> 00:22:40,228
Gareth! This is serious!

360
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,136
My time's running cut.

361
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:45,137
And we've waited long enough already.

362
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:46,181
Not this again!

363
00:22:46,816 --> 00:22:50,605
What kind of man turns down a
marathon of sex with his wife?

364
00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:52,147
Lillian...

365
00:22:52,356 --> 00:22:54,347
It's not the right time to have kids.

366
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:55,528
I'm not ready.

367
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:58,973
- You've been saying that for years!
- It's too soon!

368
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:03,478
But you're teaching now.

369
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:06,352
Take a look around you, Gary.

370
00:23:06,606 --> 00:23:08,893
It's not like we're below the poverty line.

371
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:13,884
Lillian, my career has taken a nose-dive
and I'm not finished with it yet.

372
00:23:13,896 --> 00:23:16,354
"Only those that can't do, teach."

373
00:23:16,776 --> 00:23:19,609
I haven't finished doing.
And that's the end of it.

374
00:23:25,726 --> 00:23:29,230
You still have plenty of
opportunities ahead of you, Gareth.

375
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:36,391
But I don't.

376
00:23:38,026 --> 00:23:39,858
Aw, Lily, come on.

377
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:45,280
Come on, Lillian. Come on, come here.

378
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:47,563
L hate seeing you like this.

379
00:23:54,186 --> 00:23:55,187
Look...

380
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:57,643
Just give it some time.

381
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:00,938
You know, it'll be worth the wait, won't it?

382
00:24:04,436 --> 00:24:05,437
Hey?

$IT

384
00:24:34,566 --> 00:24:36,967
So when you want to count, you count out here.

385
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,319
One, two, three, four, five.

386
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,428
But if you want to say how old you are,
you do it off your nose.

387
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:43,814
- So, I'm 257
- Yeah. That's right.

388

So, want. Don't want.

Comfortable. Not comfortable.

390
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,939
Good luck. Bad luck.

391
00:24:58,106 --> 00:24:59,858
- It's all in the expression.
- Ch!

392
00:25:00,146 --> 00:25:03,218
So, go good, bad.

393
00:25:03,226 --> 00:25:05,274
- Yeah. Pretty simple.
- Okay, um...

394
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:12,392
Did... you... get... the sign... for... stutter?

395
00:25:12,896 --> 00:25:13,897
Oh yes, yes.

396
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:15,477
Stutter.

397
00:25:16,436 --> 00:25:17,597
Yeah. Talk, block.

398
00:25:17,606 --> 00:25:18,607
Talk, block. Okay.

399
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:28,186
Um, I reckon... Uh, children...
uh, should have, um...
regular... uh, bullying... classes.

400
00:25:30,186 --> 00:25:33,019
What, to teach them how to
bully? Or how to be bullied?

401
00:25:33,026 --> 00:25:34,141
No, neither, neither. Um...

402
00:25:34,726 --> 00:25:40,278
<i>More how to... um, uh, combat a
bully... um, and how to not be one.</i>

403
00:25:41,276 --> 00:25:42,778
This is breaking my hands!

404
00:25:43,026 --> 00:25:46,314
Don't worry. You're just breaking them in.
Okay? Just keep practising.

405
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:47,858
- Okay.
- Don't worry.

406
00:25:48,686 --> 00:25:50,029

Should I crder for you, next time?

413
00:26:18,356 --> 00:26:21,360
I don't want anybody to ever speak for me.

414
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:25,133
Ohreally? Is that why we're together?
So you can learn a bit of sign language?

415

- 1s that what our relationship is based on?
- No, no, no, no, no.

I'm with you because I find you fascinating.

...the dumbest thing you could say.

423
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:55,149
You've got the skills, you
just need to keep practising.

424

That's easy for you to say, you den't have a stutter!

425
00:26:58,186 --> 00:27:01,975
Well, I'm deaf, you know!
And I have to deal with that.
It's not easy for me to say anything.

Jl've been kicked around, I've been left for dead.

520
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:21,063
Jl've been sick and tired, I've been Heaven-sent.

521
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:26,134
So, um, when I finish my degree,
I'll be, um, working in social justice...

522
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:29,901
...uh, particularly for the deaf
community and, um, deaf education.

523
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:32,221
Very admirable.

524
00:32:33,646 --> 00:32:36,229
L teach maths at the local high school.

525
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:37,819
That's one of my favourite subjects.

526
00:32:38,816 --> 00:32:42,480
Favourite subjects? You shouldn't say
things just to impress my parents.

527
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:46,223
Oh, seeing you interpret for
him is impressive enough.

528
00:32:59,356 --> 00:33:01,358
Ah! They're here, Roy!

529
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:03,938
I'll see you both in the lounge room.

530
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:13,857
Hey.

531
00:33:14,436 --> 00:33:15,642
They like you.

532
00:33:18,146 --> 00:33:19,568
That's good, I like them too.

533
00:33:22,936 --> 00:33:23,937
You know...

534
00:33:24,776 --> 00:33:28,030
With me signing to you all night...

535
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:32,276
...I think they are starting to
think I'm becoming mere, um...

536
00:33:34,436 --> 00:33:35,437

538
00:33:40,106 --> 00:33:41,642
Yeah, but Auslan's not academic.

539
00:33:42,976 --> 00:33:44,273
No, but it's, um...

540
00:33:45,026 --> 00:33:47,028
...ad-different language. It's like...

541
00:33:47,606 --> 00:33:48,596
...binary.

542
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:51,860

549
00:34:09,646 --> 00:34:10,818
They're all right.

550
00:34:13,026 --> 00:34:14,141
Well, yeah, but...

551
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:18,644
They're too academic...

552
00:34:19,276 --> 00:34:20,562
...for their own good.

553
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:22,391
And mine too.

554
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:27,778
You're perfect.

555
00:34:31,276 --> 00:34:32,607
I'm far from perfect.

556
00:34:47,566 --> 00:34:48,567
That's you.

557
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:51,524
You think I'm hollow and transparent?

558
00:34:52,816 --> 00:34:53,817
No.

559
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:55,967
Because you're well-rounded,

560
00:34:55,976 --> 00:34:57,478
and you're beautiful.

561
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:18,931
That's me?

562
00:35:19,436 --> 00:35:20,437
Exactly.

563
00:35:21,106 --> 00:35:24,474
J You'll be Thelma and I'll be Louise

564
00:35:24,726 --> 00:35:29,527
2 We'll escape this horror, easy as you please &

565
00:35:29,686 --> 00:35:30,778
And that's me?

566
00:35:31,356 --> 00:35:32,357
That's right.

567
00:35:37,726 --> 00:35:39,524
My mum is going to love you!

568
00:35:45,526 --> 00:35:47,221
[FAYE] Sketch the oval of the face.

569
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,593
There should be six constant vertical lines...

570
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:57,069
...intersecting at the apex of the head,
hairline, eyebrows, nose, mouth and chin.

571
00:35:57,356 --> 00:35:59,222
This gives the dimensions of the head.

572
00:36:00,606 --> 00:36:05,351
Duplicate another oval of the same size
and turn it ninety degrees.

573
00:36:05,606 --> 00:36:08,564
This gives the third dimension
of the skull, creating its depth.

574
00:36:10,026 --> 00:36:12,222
Follow the sternccleidomasteid...

575
00:36:12,726 --> 00:36:17,061
...inthe direction of the face and
carry it through to the clavicle.

576
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:20,638
The ear has a triangular bone structure,

577
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:23,934
with the node in the centre
having a direct line to the nose.

578
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:28,684
The eyes should measure three times
across the width of the face.

579
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:35,479
Draw a circle for the eyeball
and surround it with a hexagon.

580
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:39,025
This creates the points of the eyelids.

581
00:36:47,776 --> 00:36:49,722
Uh, now, where was I?

582
00:36:50,356 --> 00:36:51,357
Uhm...

583
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:56,854
Don't draw a mouth, draw lips.

584
00:36:57,066 --> 00:37:00,320
But don't be seduced by large lips and large eyes.

585
00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:23,145
Oh, Reuben, I'm sorry.
This must be going way over your head.

586
00:37:23,526 --> 00:37:27,360
No, it's fine. I'm just really taken
in by the dynamic in the room.

587
00:37:27,856 --> 00:37:28,971
It's a bit overwhelming, isn't it?

588
00:37:29,526 --> 00:37:30,527
L can't even...

589
00:37:30,976 --> 00:37:32,819
...what do you call it? Finger-spell, yet.

590
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:36,315
No, but you're getting there.
Maybe if I had more time to teach you.

591
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:40,230
Well, I never get the chance because full-time
carpentry keeps my hands full, literally.

592
00:37:40,316 --> 00:37:42,967
Well, I'll teach you to sign with a hammer
and a saw in each hand, then.

593
00:37:42,976 --> 00:37:43,966
All right.

594
00:37:43,976 --> 00:37:45,978
The important thing is communication.

595
00:37:46,526 --> 00:37:49,359
<i>Nothing breaks down a
relationship faster than alack of --</i>

596
00:37:49,776 --> 00:37:51,642
-- alack of communication.

597
00:37:54,276 --> 00:37:55,277
My dad.

598
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:57,107
Um...

599
00:37:57,726 --> 00:37:59,182
I found that, uh...

600
00:38:00,066 --> 00:38:06,062
...with my stutter, um, and being with, uhm,
Derek these last few months...

601
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:07,187
...that, uh, my...

602
00:38:07,436 --> 00:38:10,804
...sighing has improved and
my speech is improving too.

603
00:38:10,816 --> 00:38:12,398
So, I was, um...

604
00:38:12,976 --> 00:38:16,981
...before, thinking cf becoming mute and now...

605
00:38:17,606 --> 00:38:20,598
But you could think about changing your...

606
00:38:20,606 --> 00:38:23,883
...your barrier into something more
meaningful and purpeseful.

607
00:38:23,896 --> 00:38:26,319
You know, somebody could
really learn from your story.

608
00:38:27,936 --> 00:38:29,688
Yeah, uh, do you have a sign-name yet, Reuben?

609
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:35,223
Did-did you just... call me a loser?

610
00:38:39,646 --> 00:38:42,468
Um, no. It's, uh, it's colloquial...

611
00:38:42,476 --> 00:38:45,650
...for learning. It's kind of
like, um... like shorthand.

612
00:38:46,646 --> 00:38:47,818
Shorthand?

613
00:38:48,396 --> 00:38:49,386
That's very apt.

614
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:51,842
L was stunned the first time
Courtney invited me over.

615
00:38:51,856 --> 00:38:54,029
I mean, talk about encountering culture.

616
00:38:54,396 --> 00:38:56,148
[FAYE] You mean counterculture, don't you?

617
00:38:56,276 --> 00:38:58,597
No, I mean, it was like stepping intc another world.

618
00:38:58,606 --> 00:39:00,222
And it was anything but silent. All these...

619
00:39:00,226 --> 00:39:04,106
...gestures and things happening and
suddenly everyone just bursts out laughing.

620
00:39:04,896 --> 00:39:08,218
<i>Yeah, he said it was a little bit like
walking around and everyone's listening...</i>

621
00:39:08,226 --> 00:39:11,400
-...to acomedy podcast on headphones in public.
- Yeah!

622
00:39:11,606 --> 00:39:15,281
You know what I'm talking about.
And... Auslan's quite a talent.

623
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,722
Uh-uh, no, it's a skill.

624
00:39:17,976 --> 00:39:21,674
No, but talent is something your
born with. And it can't be taught.

625
00:39:21,686 --> 00:39:25,566
It's always inside you. It just needs a bit of a Polish.

626
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:30,897
Polish.

627
00:39:32,026 --> 00:39:37,305
I've...um, when I was in speech therapy, I - I heard
that if you need to correct
someone's words like that,

628
00:39:37,316 --> 00:39:40,320
it means that they, um, learned it by reading.

629
00:39:41,106 --> 00:39:42,107
Qch, I like that.

630
00:39:43,026 --> 00:39:44,027
[MYLES] Wow, that's deep.

631
00:39:44,726 --> 00:39:46,569
[FAYE] Well then, speaking of talent...

632
00:39:47,186 --> 00:39:50,281
I received a letter today from
the Australian Disabilit...

633
00:39:51,066 --> 00:39:53,728
The Australian Disability and Arts Society.

634
00:39:54,356 --> 00:39:55,972
They've received my submission.

635
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:59,685
Ch, Mum! That's fantastic news!
Good of them to let you know that it arrived.

636
00:40:00,066 --> 00:40:01,227
But there's more!

637
00:40:01,396 --> 00:40:03,558
They've shortlisted me for
one of their annual grants.

638
00:40:03,566 --> 00:40:07,264
- Aw, Faye! Congratulations!
- Yeah, Mum, that's fantastic news!

639
00:40:07,276 --> 00:40:08,391
- Thank you.
- What's the grant?

640
00:40:09,026 --> 00:40:10,107
Fifty grand!

641
00:40:11,146 --> 00:40:13,228
Wow! What would you do with that?

642
00:40:14,686 --> 00:40:16,438
Ch, probably...

643
00:40:16,646 --> 00:40:17,772
...fall off my chair!

644
00:40:19,566 --> 00:40:20,567
[FAYE] Reuben...

645
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:25,685
Maybe you could, um, submit that play
of yours during the next round of submissions?

646
00:40:28,816 --> 00:40:32,275
But I don't consider my speech
impediment a disability.

647
00:40:32,476 --> 00:40:34,729
Disability or not, you've got talent.

648
00:40:36,026 --> 00:40:37,027
Well...

649
00:40:37,106 --> 00:40:40,315
You must be a good man because
you passed the first - the litmus test.

650
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:43,399
The neighbour's dog didn't bark at you as
you walked past, up the driveway.

651
00:40:47,226 --> 00:40:48,227
Derek?

652
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:50,522
Does your...? Do you like...?

653
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:52,392
...think in sign language?

654
00:40:53,026 --> 00:40:56,030
Like, do the voices in your
head, like, sign to each other?

655
00:40:56,316 --> 00:40:59,229
Well, my thoughts don't stutter
if that's any difference.

656
00:40:59,476 --> 00:41:03,219
Yeah, but I always thought, like, a speech
impediment was caused by...

657
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:06,901
...anxiety or like an intellectual kind of... thing?

658
00:41:07,316 --> 00:41:10,889
I've always thought that once people
start seeing themselves as a victim...

659
00:41:10,896 --> 00:41:12,318
...that's that they become.

660
00:41:12,476 --> 00:41:15,821
L only ask because the three of us could
all apply to the ADAS Fund.

661
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:19,315
A playwright, a carpenter and a deaf politician.

662
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:22,897
I'm an activist.

663
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:25,029
[FAYE] More like a crusader.

664
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:27,017
L know what you're thinking.

665
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:31,315
"Silly Myles, a tradie can't be a writer."
But a creative mind is a creative mind.

666
00:41:31,566 --> 00:41:32,567
He's got a point there.

667
00:41:33,146 --> 00:41:33,977
What's the idea?

668
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:36,056
Picture it;

669
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:39,513
<i>An epic, sweeping historical
drama about carpenters.</i>

670
00:41:39,526 --> 00:41:40,937
[FAYE] Hm, sounds biblical.

671
00:41:42,726 --> 00:41:44,683
It's called "Gone With The Window".

672
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:50,522
It's about this little
renocvaticn/construction company
run by this cbnoxiocus chick
named Charlctte G'Hara, right...

673
00:41:50,816 --> 00:41:54,844
Well, Charlotte's got this burning crush on this
delicate lesbian named Ashleigh.

674
00:41:54,856 --> 00:41:58,429
Ashleigh is going out with this
prissy little twit named Melanie
and this guy, Brett, or whatever...

675
00:41:58,436 --> 00:42:01,713
...comes along and declares his undying
love for Charlotte and she's all like, "nah".

676
00:42:01,726 --> 00:42:04,593
And it's set in this epic crisis, like the GFC.

677
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:05,721
So, everyone's going bankrupt.

678
00:42:05,726 --> 00:42:09,811
So, Brett and Charlotte join forces and employ
abunch of slaves to burn down half the city.

679
00:42:09,896 --> 00:42:13,343
Which Brett and Charlotte
will then make a fortune on,
when they're hired to rebuild everything...

680
00:42:13,356 --> 00:42:16,303
...whilst underhandedly helping people
claim on their insurance policies.

681
00:42:16,316 --> 00:42:20,264
Melanie and Ashleigh, though, decide to sell their
big plantation to Brett, in exchange for his sperm.

682
00:42:20,276 --> 00:42:26,101
Melanie gets pregnant through IVF
and Charlctte decides tc drop a
palette of cinder blocks on her
head in exchange for the chair.

683
00:42:27,816 --> 00:42:28,817
What do you reckon?

684
00:42:34,526 --> 00:42:35,527
[Faye laughs]

685
00:42:36,276 --> 00:42:37,277
You know...

686
00:42:37,566 --> 00:42:38,772
When Derek was little...

687
00:42:38,936 --> 00:42:41,189
...the neighbours were selling a litter of puppies.

688
00:42:41,316 --> 00:42:43,728
Of course, Derek was drawn to the runt of the litter.

689
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,901
L discouraged him, saying that
the runt was special and...

690
00:42:49,436 --> 00:42:51,530
...and it shouldn't be taken away from his mum.

691
00:42:53,566 --> 00:42:56,183
He locked up at me with those
big green eyes and said;

692
00:42:57,186 --> 00:43:00,975
"Mummy, am I a runt puppy too?"

693
00:43:02,526 --> 00:43:04,312
It nearly broke my heart.

694
00:43:07,976 --> 00:43:09,899
It was then I knew I had a choice;

695
00:43:10,976 --> 00:43:13,104
I could either protect him from the world...

696
00:43:13,896 --> 00:43:17,025
...or be there to pick up the pieces
when the world was done with him.

697
00:43:17,776 --> 00:43:19,028
L chose the latter.

698
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:23,684
[FAYE] Derek has areal sense of right and wrong.

699
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:28,321
And for better or for worse, it keeps
him frem mixing with the wrong crowd.

700
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,813
Matthew was heavy-handed.

701
00:43:31,106 --> 00:43:33,723
He was anti-Auslan and pro-surgery.

702
00:43:34,436 --> 00:43:38,225
Cochlear implants are a real point of
contention with the deaf community.

703
00:43:38,776 --> 00:43:41,211
And when both of Derek's attempts failed,

704
00:43:41,226 --> 00:43:43,934
Matthew concluded that his son was defective.

705
00:43:44,146 --> 00:43:49,812
[REUBEN] Why? He's so articulate and he...
he can express his intelligence
at every opportunity.

706
00:43:50,476 --> 00:43:52,023
[FAYE] That comes from building him up.

707
00:43:52,316 --> 00:43:54,717
Confidence accumulates over time,

708
00:43:54,726 --> 00:43:57,184
until a person can make it on their own.

709
00:43:57,226 --> 00:44:01,356
As you can imagine, it doesn't take very
much to knock somebody down.

710
00:44:01,476 --> 00:44:05,026
[REUBEN] Is that why Derek has such an
interest in political and social agendas?

711
00:44:05,316 --> 00:44:09,071
[FAYE] I think so. Turning negatives inte
a positive is the key to survival.

712
00:44:10,066 --> 00:44:13,149
You know, when I'm with Derek
and - and - and I'm signing...

713
00:44:13,686 --> 00:44:16,360
...I've my... my confidence back.

714
00:44:16,776 --> 00:44:21,976
L could have used these sKkills
tc give up och my speech
impediment altcgether and not
have to worry about it again, but...

715
00:44:22,276 --> 00:44:26,395
...I've found that since I've met Derek,
I've sort of resolved the problem.

716
00:44:27,316 --> 00:44:32,231
But... when I'm signing, I'm so
much more charismatic and clear!

717
00:44:32,776 --> 00:44:35,848
And I think; this would be a really
good second act for my screenplay.

718
00:44:35,856 --> 00:44:39,281
L was thinking it would be about a guy
who gets through his speech impediment...

719
00:44:39,356 --> 00:44:42,439
...with his deaf partner using
Auslan and the deaf community.

720
00:44:42,526 --> 00:44:43,687
What do you think?

721
00:44:44,276 --> 00:44:47,109
And I suppose you'd like to, um...

722
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:51,139
...give in tc Derek's aspirations as an
actor and make him the lead role?

723
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,147
Yeah!

724
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:53,716
Look...

725
00:44:53,726 --> 00:44:58,641
One-hit wonders like Marlee Matlin
come and go in a flash with the deaf community.

726
00:44:59,646 --> 00:45:02,934
But, if Derek concentrated his energies into...

727
00:45:03,186 --> 00:45:06,679
...human rights, activism, deaf-awareness...

728
00:45:06,686 --> 00:45:07,938
...like Helen Keller...

729
00:45:08,276 --> 00:45:10,472
Now that's a real purpose.

730
00:45:11,276 --> 00:45:13,222
No, Faye. That's real hypocrisy.

731
00:45:26,526 --> 00:45:31,475
How can something so... strong...

732
00:45:31,726 --> 00:45:32,727
...beso...

733
00:45:34,856 --> 00:45:37,029
...gentle and expressive?

734
00:45:37,436 --> 00:45:39,313
Work it out yourself, man!

735
00:45:43,396 --> 00:45:44,397
[Reuben exhales deeply]

736
00:45:47,026 --> 00:45:48,027
Could you hear that?

737
00:45:48,896 --> 00:45:50,148
Yeah, I felt that!

738
00:45:54,566 --> 00:45:55,681
Can you feel that?

739
00:45:55,936 --> 00:45:57,938
Yeah, I can feel that!

740
00:46:02,646 --> 00:46:04,182
L can feel that, too.

741
00:46:06,186 --> 00:46:08,860
$IT

742
00:46:14,226 --> 00:46:17,890
[REUBEN] Are you sure he - he - he - he...
he wants to meet with me, not
just read the screenplay...

743
00:46:17,896 --> 00:46:20,263
.on -on -on his cwn?

744
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:24,110
[DEREK] Den't worry. Relax.
I'll be with you every step of the way.

745
00:46:30,476 --> 00:46:31,602
G-G-G-Gareth!

746
00:46:31,896 --> 00:46:33,102
You must be Reuben.

747
00:46:33,186 --> 00:46:34,187
G'day.

748
00:46:34,276 --> 00:46:35,277
Yeah, uh...

749
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,650
I don't normally take, uh, unsolicited calls, but...

750
00:46:39,646 --> 00:46:43,344
Uh, I guess it's all, um,
eh-uh-uh, very su - very sudden.

751
00:46:43,356 --> 00:46:44,687
Yeah, yeah, whoa. It's okay.

752
00:46:44,816 --> 00:46:48,059
Actually I was honoured
that you, uh, thought of me.
Uh, sit down, sit down.

753
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:49,568
- Okay.

754
00:46:51,146 --> 00:46:54,571
Tell me about this idea -- are you a, uh, a student?

755
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:56,853
- Writer.
- Ch, a writer?

756
00:46:57,686 --> 00:47:00,929
My wife works with a lot of writers.
She's a copyright lawyer.

757
00:47:00,936 --> 00:47:03,348
She's also my own personal legal rep.

758
00:47:03,356 --> 00:47:05,859
I don't do a thing unless she's put her stamp on it.

759
00:47:06,976 --> 00:47:07,807
Oh.

760
00:47:07,816 --> 00:47:09,682
Have you got a copy of the script?

761
00:47:10,606 --> 00:47:11,971
Yeah! Um...

762
00:47:12,476 --> 00:47:14,217
Uh, this is Derek. He-he's deaf.

763
00:47:14,226 --> 00:47:16,467
Oh, hey. Gareth Dona...

764
00:47:16,476 --> 00:47:17,477
Sorry.

765
00:47:18,226 --> 00:47:20,934
I'll leave it up to you to keep him up to speed.

766
00:47:23,396 --> 00:47:24,898
Right, uh...

767
00:47:25,646 --> 00:47:26,977
"The Burden of Being Me"

768
00:47:27,686 --> 00:47:28,892
Interesting title.

769
00:47:29,606 --> 00:47:30,357
Thank you.

770
00:47:31,276 --> 00:47:32,266
What's it about?

771
00:47:32,276 --> 00:47:33,641
Um, us. It's, um...

772
00:47:33,646 --> 00:47:36,900
It's, uh, the main c-character,
uh, Robin, he's, um...

773
00:47:37,356 --> 00:47:42,430
He - he - he - he - he's based on me, he wants
to be atheatre a-a-a-a-actor and he, um...

774
00:47:42,436 --> 00:47:44,131
...he has this, uh, this-Th-Th-this-is --

775
00:47:44,146 --> 00:47:45,136
Look!

776
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:46,682
-...this stammer...
- Hang on, hang on, hang on!

777
00:47:47,356 --> 00:47:50,530
You - you don't have to be starstruck
around me. I'm just a regular guy.

778
00:47:51,526 --> 00:47:53,563
L wasn't... was 1?

779
00:47:54,146 --> 00:47:57,355
I-1-1 have a stutter, that's what
you're picking up on, but...

780
00:47:58,436 --> 00:48:01,815
...l get that when I'm crdering a cheeseburger.
So it's not like it's really about you at all.

781
00:48:02,026 --> 00:48:03,471
Have you tried speech therapy?

782
00:48:05,726 --> 00:48:07,273
Yes... but, um...

783
00:48:08,316 --> 00:48:10,717
Nothing is better for me than when I'm signing.

784
00:48:10,726 --> 00:48:12,353
[GARETH] Then, why haven't
you been signing all along?

785
00:48:13,936 --> 00:48:15,313
I-1-1 dunno. It's weird.

786
00:48:16,606 --> 00:48:20,782
Uh, "Burden", is this... your only project?
Have you got anything better?

787
00:48:21,396 --> 00:48:24,320
It's my life story, so it matters the most to me.

788
00:48:24,606 --> 00:48:29,635
And it - it's about masculinity and assertion
and courage and self-esteem, belonging --

789
00:48:29,646 --> 00:48:31,068
And self-indulgence!

790
00:48:32,726 --> 00:48:33,727
No...

791
00:48:34,316 --> 00:48:37,024
They say "if you want to be a filmmaker,
you need to write about what you know".

792
00:48:37,316 --> 00:48:39,353
L thought you said you wanted to be a theatre actor?

793
00:48:41,976 --> 00:48:42,977
That's more the character.

794
00:48:43,526 --> 00:48:44,527
Ugh, okay!

795
00:48:47,606 --> 00:48:49,313
You're going to have a lot of trouble with this.

796
00:48:50,186 --> 00:48:50,971
Why?

797
00:48:50,976 --> 00:48:54,389
You can't expect to be a director and have a stutter.
People will lose patience.

798
00:48:54,396 --> 00:48:55,101
What?

799
00:48:55,526 --> 00:48:58,427
You also have to be open
and prepared for criticism...

800
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,394
...at all times, if you want toc
survive in the film industry.

801
00:49:02,186 --> 00:49:03,472
I don't think that's true.

802
00:49:03,476 --> 00:49:08,550
Take any career outside of the arts and they're
not open to that much scathing review and criticism.

803
00:49:08,566 --> 00:49:11,763
Like, take, uh, a teacher or a doctor or a lawyer;

804
00:49:11,776 --> 00:49:16,304
People can either be taught or not taught,
treated or not treated, trialled or not trialled...

805
00:49:16,316 --> 00:49:20,435
...but the point is that nobody can tell me whether
I'm good enough to be an actor or a writer.

806
00:49:21,186 --> 00:49:22,859
You really are a wordsmith, Reuben.

807
00:49:23,816 --> 00:49:25,648
You didn't stutter cnce through that.

808
00:49:26,226 --> 00:49:30,026
Which means when you're passionate
about something, all that stuff goes away!

809
00:49:30,606 --> 00:49:33,064
Which is why I'm interested
in being part of this film.

810
00:49:33,476 --> 00:49:35,774
Really? Oh, thanks, Gareth!

811
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:39,480
So, the main characters are Robin and Drake...?

812
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,392
Have you cast anyone?

813
00:49:43,276 --> 00:49:44,277
Us.

814
00:49:48,646 --> 00:49:50,102
Who's producing?

815
00:49:51,566 --> 00:49:54,183
I don't actually have a producer as yet...

816
00:49:56,106 --> 00:49:57,892
But if you know anybody...?

817
00:50:08,976 --> 00:50:12,901
I've not actually produced a movie befere,
but I think "Burden"...

818
00:50:13,146 --> 00:50:14,773
...has the makings of a...

819
00:50:14,896 --> 00:50:19,311
...atopical and a very profitable film.
It's a... a story about two...

820
00:50:19,646 --> 00:50:22,308
...characters who are LGBT and disabled --

821
00:50:22,316 --> 00:50:26,071
-- disability's a great thing at the moment.
It's right in vogue! Spot on.

822
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:30,525
So, hypothetically, how would you produce it?

823
00:50:30,606 --> 00:50:32,279
What? Me, personally?

824
00:50:33,226 --> 00:50:35,012
L would run it by my wife, Lillian.

825
00:50:35,026 --> 00:50:38,018
We would doc some preliminary
proposals for the funding bodies;

826
00:50:38,026 --> 00:50:41,212
The Australian Screen Fund,
The Film Finance of New Scuth Wales...

827
00:50:41,226 --> 00:50:44,184
...The Sydney Screen Company.
I've got some, uh, contacts. You know?

828
00:50:45,106 --> 00:50:47,313
Wow, you've got some really deft skill.

829
00:50:48,436 --> 00:50:49,437
It's called being professional.

830
00:50:52,476 --> 00:50:53,477
Perfect!

831
00:50:55,026 --> 00:50:56,027
All right!

832
00:50:57,186 --> 00:50:58,438
I'm excited to get started!

833
00:50:58,726 --> 00:50:59,727
Uh, can I keep this?

834
00:50:59,936 --> 00:51:02,030
- Sure.
- And can you...?

835
00:51:02,186 --> 00:51:03,813
...email me a soft copy?

836
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:05,227
Thanks, Gareth. Yeah.

837
00:51:07,436 --> 00:51:08,437
Talk to you later!

838
00:51:09,726 --> 00:51:10,727
Thank you!

839
00:51:13,396 --> 00:51:14,397
What does that mean?

840
00:51:15,186 --> 00:51:17,280
He thinks he's king shit, doesn't he?

841
00:51:18,816 --> 00:51:22,184
He-he-he's a famous, uh, film... person.

842
00:51:22,316 --> 00:51:24,182
He-he-he's trying to impress us.

843
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:25,772
No, it doesn't.

844
00:51:28,026 --> 00:51:29,027
That man...

845
00:51:29,436 --> 00:51:31,643
...wants to support my film.

846
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:34,029
We should be happy about this.

847
00:51:35,856 --> 00:51:36,857
Come on.

848
00:51:43,186 --> 00:51:44,187
How is it?

849
00:51:48,186 --> 00:51:49,187
Lillian!

850
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:50,516
Oh, sorry!

851
00:51:50,526 --> 00:51:51,527
What's it like?

852
00:51:51,686 --> 00:51:54,474
It's very engrossing!

853
00:51:55,186 --> 00:51:58,861
Any, uh, juicy roles for a
distinguished actor like myself?

854
00:51:59,976 --> 00:52:01,262
Um...

855
00:52:01,276 --> 00:52:02,277
Yes.

856
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:04,022
The role of Shane.

857
00:52:04,276 --> 00:52:06,893
He's the estranged father of the deaf guy.

858
00:52:07,066 --> 00:52:08,761
He doesn't sign, but...

859
00:52:08,776 --> 00:52:10,221
...ch,it's interesting!
- Good, good, good.

860
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:12,433
More suitable for me, if he doesn't sign.

861
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:15,593
But, he also gets jealous of Robin!

862
00:52:15,606 --> 00:52:18,280
For having his son's emotional priority.

863
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:22,110
It's a very well-crafted story of the male ego!

864
00:52:24,566 --> 00:52:25,567
Excellent.

865
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,729
This could be the big break I've been waiting for.

866
00:54:04,646 --> 00:54:08,719
I've, uh, taken the liberty of giving a
friend of mine the script.

867
00:54:08,726 --> 00:54:11,570
She's a - a proper writer and proofreader, so...

868
00:54:12,276 --> 00:54:14,062
My mum's a proofreader.

869
00:54:14,726 --> 00:54:16,216
Did she read the script?

870
00:54:16,226 --> 00:54:17,773
No, but it's still my story.

871
00:54:17,856 --> 00:54:18,846
Hmm.

872
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:22,110
<i>Well, it's just as well I had it professionally
proofread. There's some notes.</i>

873
00:54:25,606 --> 00:54:28,678
<i>Uh, Gareth, I don't like - I don't want people
re-re-reading my-my-my-my screenplay.</i>

874
00:54:28,686 --> 00:54:29,687
Reuben!

875
00:54:29,896 --> 00:54:31,728
L can't understand a word you're saying.

876
00:54:33,226 --> 00:54:36,469
L don't want people reading my
screenplay without my permission.

877
00:54:36,476 --> 00:54:38,308
Please don't go spreading it around.

878
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,091
Look, it never hurts to get a second opinion.

879
00:54:40,106 --> 00:54:42,712
And you are really going to have to get
used to people criticising your work...

880
00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:44,933
...if you want to be in this industry.

881
00:54:45,976 --> 00:54:48,070
Haven't we - haven't we
already had this conversation?

882
00:54:51,646 --> 00:54:52,852
Look, she has noidea!

883
00:54:53,066 --> 00:54:54,227
Oh, what do you mean?

884
00:54:54,476 --> 00:54:56,478
She - she says here "cut out the bubble scene"!

885
00:54:56,816 --> 00:54:57,817
Let me see...

886
00:54:58,276 --> 00:55:01,132
Yeah, look. Right here, in her notes. It says...

887
00:55:01,146 --> 00:55:03,922
"Not a believable exchange between characters".

888
00:55:03,936 --> 00:55:05,347
That's how it really happened, though!

889
00:55:05,356 --> 00:55:07,176
Well, doesn't it matter? Does it serve a purpose?

890
00:55:07,186 --> 00:55:08,472
Have you even read the screenplay?

891
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:13,146
Itis clearly a-a-a-a visual metaphor,
showing the characters' united resolve!

892
00:55:17,776 --> 00:55:19,778
Of course I've read the screenplay, Reuben!

893
00:55:20,356 --> 00:55:23,940
Do you think I'd be putting this much work into
something that I didn't understand completely?

894
00:55:25,606 --> 00:55:26,596
Anyway, we're getting off track.

895
00:55:26,606 --> 00:55:28,062
And-and right here, she says;

896
00:55:28,816 --> 00:55:31,672
"It's too dry-wit with dialogue. It
isn't how people really speak."

897
00:55:31,686 --> 00:55:34,303
She's gone through it, saying
"Ha!" and "LOL" all over the place.

898
00:55:34,316 --> 00:55:35,841
Who does that with - with proofreading?

899
00:55:35,856 --> 00:55:38,359
It's just her opinion, Reuben.
You don't have to nitpick it.

900
00:55:39,106 --> 00:55:41,598
But she's gone through my entire
screenplay and nitpicked it!

901
00:55:41,606 --> 00:55:43,893
She's a professional writer.

902
00:55:44,316 --> 00:55:45,932
She's won awards for her work.

903
00:55:45,936 --> 00:55:48,212
So what? This isn't her writing!

904
00:55:48,226 --> 00:55:52,185
The funding bodies look favourably on projects
that have award-winning people attached.

905
00:55:52,436 --> 00:55:55,883
The tighter you edit it, the more
chance you stand of making the film.

906
00:55:55,896 --> 00:55:57,182
But I'm the writer.

907
00:55:57,186 --> 00:55:58,381
Then why didn't you edit it?

908
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:00,512
L did! But she's gone through it with a chainsaw!

909
00:56:00,526 --> 00:56:02,278
That's how you edit!

910
00:56:02,476 --> 00:56:04,513
You have to be savage and cut a lot out.

911
00:56:04,526 --> 00:56:06,608
But that's my job, as the writer. And how about --

912
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,318
What happens when I'm directing it?

913
00:56:09,186 --> 00:56:10,187
Huh?

914
00:56:11,146 --> 00:56:12,932
I'm directing this film, aren't 1?

915
00:56:14,936 --> 00:56:16,222
- Are you?
- Yes!

916
00:56:16,226 --> 00:56:17,671
What makes you think you know how to direct?

917
00:56:17,686 --> 00:56:19,802
- My plays!
- It's not the same thing, Reuben.

918
00:56:19,816 --> 00:56:21,136
Of course, it's the same thing!

919
00:56:21,146 --> 00:56:24,423
L don't need to imagine the story,
like some other director would, I have lived it!

920
00:56:24,436 --> 00:56:26,109
Ugh, so you keep saying!

921
00:56:26,896 --> 00:56:27,897
Ugh!

922
00:56:29,856 --> 00:56:31,858
Perhaps you're too close to the story.

923
00:56:32,316 --> 00:56:36,719
Your - your - your decision making process
can be influenced by your emotional connection...

924
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,309
...to the finer points.
I really think you should reconsider...

925
00:56:39,316 --> 00:56:43,765
...before taking on such a heavy
responsibility without some experience.

926
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:45,642
I 'have all the experience that I need.

927
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:49,964
And I never asked for this critical analysis from
somebody who has no idea about it.

928
00:56:49,976 --> 00:56:52,684
Oh, oh, welll Ch. I won't tell her you said that.

929
00:56:55,646 --> 00:56:56,647
Was it you, Gareth?

930
00:56:58,726 --> 00:56:59,921
Ch, Reuben!

931
00:56:59,936 --> 00:57:03,361
I 'have far better things to do with
my time than to fix your screenplay.

932
00:57:04,686 --> 00:57:06,063
Look, about the legals...

933
00:57:07,276 --> 00:57:08,277
Your, uh...

934
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:13,180
Your mum didn't proofread the screenplay,
because you said it's based on her?

935
00:57:13,186 --> 00:57:16,110
So how many people in the actual script are real?

936
00:57:16,396 --> 00:57:17,511
Quite a few.

937
00:57:17,526 --> 00:57:18,561
Who?

938
00:57:18,566 --> 00:57:20,341
Well, there's me, because it's
my story, and Derek and --

939
00:57:20,356 --> 00:57:22,358
Yeah, yeah, I mean is -- is it your original work?

940
00:57:22,436 --> 00:57:23,267
Of course.

941
00:57:23,276 --> 00:57:25,813
Have the names and distinguishing
characteristics been changed?

942
00:57:26,936 --> 00:57:28,222
Yeah, what are you getting at?

943
00:57:29,186 --> 00:57:30,187
Well...

944
00:57:31,726 --> 00:57:35,310
I need to get Lily to draw up contracts
for the people mentioned to give their approval...

945
00:57:35,316 --> 00:57:38,638
...for their likeness and characters
based on them to be in the movie.

946
00:57:38,646 --> 00:57:40,023
That isn't necessary at all.

947
00:57:40,776 --> 00:57:41,777
At all.

948
00:57:44,936 --> 00:57:46,358
Okay. Will your mum sue?

949
00:57:47,316 --> 00:57:49,512
- Why would she sue?
- Defamation. Slander.

950
00:57:49,526 --> 00:57:52,052
- I'm not slandering my own
mother in my screenplay.
- You never know!

951
00:57:52,066 --> 00:57:54,387
No, I know. Nobedy is going to sue anybody.

952
00:57:54,396 --> 00:57:56,319
It's called being prepared, Reuben.

953
00:57:58,066 --> 00:57:59,898
Speaking of which...

954
00:58:01,396 --> 00:58:04,730
I've, uh, done, uh, a script
breakdown for the budget.

955
00:58:07,026 --> 00:58:08,721
I didn't think it would be this much.

956
00:58:09,106 --> 00:58:10,892
No. Of course, you wouldn't.

957
00:58:11,146 --> 00:58:15,481
This is how it's done in the professional industry.
I've done this budget the proper way.

958
00:58:15,856 --> 00:58:18,393
Why are Derek and I only "proposed cast"?

959
00:58:18,726 --> 00:58:22,219
Well, the funding corps are
going to want name actors, you know.

960
00:58:22,226 --> 00:58:23,842
We probably should get some big names.

961
00:58:23,856 --> 00:58:25,358
Is that why you're on here?

962
00:58:25,606 --> 00:58:26,596
Well...

963
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:28,938
You want me to act and produce, don't you?

964
00:58:29,686 --> 00:58:32,530
Well ye-yes... but there's no little
asterisk next to your name.

965
00:58:33,896 --> 00:58:35,182
Ch, Reuben!

966
00:58:35,776 --> 00:58:37,062
I'm a known actor!

967
00:58:37,936 --> 00:58:38,926
You know...

968
00:58:38,936 --> 00:58:43,100
Giving me top billing makes this project
far more attractive to distributors.

969
00:58:43,106 --> 00:58:44,847
That should be your focus!

970
00:58:44,856 --> 00:58:47,177
My focus is on the integrity of my screenplay!

971
00:58:47,186 --> 00:58:49,348
And that bubble scene has to be in it for the plot!

972
00:58:49,356 --> 00:58:50,926
We're not harping back to that, are we?

973
00:58:50,936 --> 00:58:51,676
[exasperated cry]

974
00:58:51,686 --> 00:58:53,461
You must be Reuben Heywood!

975
00:58:53,476 --> 00:58:56,434
I read your script. It's very well done.

976
00:58:56,686 --> 00:58:58,472
Well, thank you very much. I'm glad you think so.

977
00:58:58,566 --> 00:59:00,386
Are you talking about the bubble scene?

978
00:59:00,396 --> 00:59:01,386
Yes, but --

979
00:59:01,396 --> 00:59:04,821
I thought it was inspired!
How did you come up with that?

980
00:59:05,316 --> 00:59:08,934
It just sort hap-happened that way, I guess.
I was very eloquent with bubbles that night.

981
00:59:09,106 --> 00:59:09,857
It's brilliant!

982
00:59:10,066 --> 00:59:12,728
- The bubble is the perfect metaphor!
- Thank you! Thank you!

983
00:59:12,776 --> 00:59:15,598
It's weightless, it can't be lifted by 100 men!

984
00:59:15,606 --> 00:59:18,303
And it's too fragile. Imagine
100 men trying to lift at it!

985
00:59:18,316 --> 00:59:23,277
[REUBEN] I was thinking if there were bubbles
coming through the frame
it would be really artistic...

986
00:59:23,316 --> 00:59:24,317
[LILLIAN] Excellent!

987
00:59:24,856 --> 00:59:27,188
$IT

988
00:59:40,976 --> 00:59:41,977
I already did!

989
00:59:43,276 --> 00:59:46,109
Nice to see you're keeping your
cool in this weather, Courtney.

990
00:59:46,936 --> 00:59:49,177
Can you come and help me sort
those paint tins, out back?

991
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:51,314
I'm busy. Ask this couch potato.

992
00:59:52,106 --> 00:59:53,801
Derek's had exams all week.

993
00:59:53,816 --> 00:59:57,901
Well, ask Reuben. I can't remember the last time
he wasn't hanging around like a bad smell.

994
00:59:58,436 --> 01:00:01,770
Reuben's off helping that actor
friend of his become a producer.

995
01:00:01,776 --> 01:00:03,892
Shows fine leadership and equity.

996
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:07,525
Your hairdressing business might have
done better if you'd had a mentor.

997
01:00:07,776 --> 01:00:12,225
Ch yeah, a mentor half my age and with
a speech imp -- a speech impediment!

998
01:00:12,686 --> 01:00:13,687
Oh, shut up!

999
01:00:13,726 --> 01:00:16,070
Oh look, what's burrowed into your mood today?

1000
01:00:27,726 --> 01:00:28,978
What does that mean?

1001
01:00:33,936 --> 01:00:35,222
Ugh, Mum!

1002
01:00:38,146 --> 01:00:40,069
She could never take a joke!

1003
01:00:46,566 --> 01:00:47,852
Is this a joke, Gareth?

1004
01:00:48,316 --> 01:00:50,557
L was looking at the Australian Screen Fund...

1005
01:00:50,566 --> 01:00:55,402
...and it clearly states that
they don't support projects
where one entity is the writer, director or actor.

1006
01:00:56,026 --> 01:00:57,027
So...

1007
01:00:58,726 --> 01:01:03,232
We could bump you intc a
cameo somewhere, but you
and your boyfriend just can't write your own roles.

1008
01:01:03,936 --> 01:01:06,189
Both of us? But what about Derek's role?

1009
01:01:06,316 --> 01:01:08,227
Well, he's never acted. We
don't even know if he can act.

1010
01:01:08,936 --> 01:01:10,813
L know he can act, I've seen him do it.

1011
01:01:11,026 --> 01:01:13,723
Reuben, nepotism is not a good thing.

1012
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:15,028
Coming from you?

1013
01:01:15,436 --> 01:01:18,849
<i>And - and nobody in here is even noted
as being good enough for Shane.</i>

1014
01:01:18,856 --> 01:01:20,517
Ch, what? You don't think I can play the part?

1015
01:01:20,526 --> 01:01:21,937
- No, I --
- Who have you got in mind?

1016
01:01:22,066 --> 01:01:25,149
- Well, nobody but --
- Reuben! Do you want my help or not?

1017
01:01:25,856 --> 01:01:29,815
L'just think it would be more authentic if
Derek and I play ourselves. That - that's all.

1018
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:31,897
Okay...

1019
01:01:32,726 --> 01:01:33,716
Well...

1020
01:01:33,726 --> 01:01:37,594
You won't get the funding and then you'll have
to make the film with unpaid acters and crew...

1021
01:01:37,606 --> 01:01:39,392
...who can walk off at any time.
Is that what you want?

1022
01:01:39,526 --> 01:01:41,642
- No! It's just --
- Look, Reuben!

1023
01:01:41,816 --> 01:01:43,068
If you do it my way...

1024
01:01:43,606 --> 01:01:45,529
...this film is going to make you a lot of money.

1025
01:01:46,066 --> 01:01:48,683
I don't want a lot of money, I want the catharsis.

1026
01:01:49,476 --> 01:01:51,183
That's not how business works!

1027
01:01:52,066 --> 01:01:54,569
This is show business.

1028
01:01:54,896 --> 01:01:56,432
You need to put on a show.

1029
01:01:56,776 --> 01:02:00,428
And to do that you need to go cut and
big name actors with lots of razzle dazzle,

1030
01:02:00,436 --> 01:02:03,963
not some kind of glorified home movie
with you and your boyfriend making cut.

1031
01:02:03,976 --> 01:02:07,731
- That's not what it is at all!
- You've gotta make money! You've got to!

1032
01:02:08,226 --> 01:02:12,185
You've got to reach large audiences!
You've got to cross cultural divides!

1033
01:02:12,526 --> 01:02:13,527
Qch, coh!

1034
01:02:16,976 --> 01:02:18,922
What if we make one of the characters Chinese?

1035
01:02:18,936 --> 01:02:20,677
- No!
- Why not?

1036
01:02:20,686 --> 01:02:25,772
Because the film isn't about that. It's about people
wi-wi-wi-with disabilities a-a-a-and who are deaf.

1037
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:26,977
And...

1038
01:02:27,026 --> 01:02:33,523
Because the leads are LGBT
it's already an encrmous
cultural standpoint. And it's -
it's already relevant and topical.

1039
01:02:33,726 --> 01:02:36,514
You don't need to shoehorn in
every minority just to tick boxes...

1040
01:02:36,526 --> 01:02:39,177
...and the peint is, people will come
to a film for a good story.

1041
01:02:39,186 --> 01:02:40,631
It doesn't matter who the actors are.

1042
01:02:40,646 --> 01:02:43,172
You've clearly never made a movie before.

1043
01:02:43,186 --> 01:02:45,609
- No, I haven't but --
- And the ASF know it!

1044
01:02:45,726 --> 01:02:47,683
Excuse me, I'm trying to speak here!

1045
01:02:49,776 --> 01:02:50,777
Okay.

1046
01:02:54,026 --> 01:02:55,027
I'm listening.

1047
01:02:55,436 --> 01:02:56,551
No, you're not!

1048
01:02:56,566 --> 01:02:59,183
You're just... waiting for me
to finish so you can argue!

1049
01:02:59,396 --> 01:03:00,386
Huh?

1050
01:03:00,396 --> 01:03:02,592
Huh? What kind of uneducated belch is that?

1051
01:03:02,606 --> 01:03:04,802
Reuben! Life is too short for your stuttering!

1052
01:03:04,816 --> 01:03:06,011
Your patience is too short!

1053
01:03:06,026 --> 01:03:07,425
Ugh, now you're talking shit. I have to go to work.

1054
01:03:07,436 --> 01:03:09,530
- But, Gareth I was --
- No, Precious!

1055
01:03:09,776 --> 01:03:11,107
I don't want to hearit!

1056
01:03:11,316 --> 01:03:16,277
And no one else does either! I am working my
butt off for his film that's so important to you!

1057
01:03:16,436 --> 01:03:18,347
- But, Gareth, this is my --
- And this how you repay me?

1058
01:03:18,356 --> 01:03:19,801
- This is my life story --
- Get out!

1059
01:03:19,816 --> 01:03:21,523
- Gareth! Fuck!
- Get out!

1060
01:03:21,646 --> 01:03:24,593
I've been in the film industry longer
than you've been alive, Reuben!

1061
01:03:24,606 --> 01:03:26,677
I've seen the plight of gay and leshian people...

1062
01:03:26,686 --> 01:03:29,804
...I've been to third world countries and
seen the slums and the poverty there...

1063
01:03:29,816 --> 01:03:33,639
<i>...but people help those people, Reuben,
because they're grateful
for everything they have ...</i>

1064
01:03:33,646 --> 01:03:35,171
- No, Gareth! No!
- ... unlike you!

1065
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,518
You think you-you-you can do w-w-w-w-whatever
you want h-h-h-here can't you, Gareth...

1066
01:03:37,526 --> 01:03:39,301
...but you can't! Because you
don't have any disabilities...

1067
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:40,966
- Spit out, mate!
-...youaren't LGBT...

1068
01:03:40,976 --> 01:03:43,183
...and you don't have any poverty.
Because, lock around you, Gareth!

1069
01:03:44,106 --> 01:03:46,973
James Cameron wasn't on
the fuckin' Titanic, Reuben!

1070
01:03:47,146 --> 01:03:50,923
Yet he made one hell of a movie about it!
With big names! With big money!

1071
01:03:50,936 --> 01:03:52,688
The way it's supposed to be made!

1072
01:03:52,816 --> 01:03:54,352
You know how he made it?

1073
01:03:54,856 --> 01:03:55,857
Hm?

1074
01:03:56,526 --> 01:03:58,813
He filmed it in Mexico.

1075
01:03:59,226 --> 01:04:01,320
Using the local unemployed.

1076
01:04:02,146 --> 01:04:04,069
You see, it's not about altruism...

1077
01:04:04,526 --> 01:04:07,644
...it's about the fuckin' money! Now, get cut!

1078
01:04:08,776 --> 01:04:11,780

2 And totally blind

1084
01:04:44,776 --> 01:04:49,475
J To not see the life we could lead

1085
01:04:50,436 --> 01:04:52,211

2 My favourite regret J

1088
01:04:59,226 --> 01:05:00,523
[MYLES] So, your mum drew that?

1089
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:04,724
Mmhm. Little bit of a Derek shrine up there.

1090
01:05:05,396 --> 01:05:07,353
He looks like a surfing Jesus.

1091
01:05:07,606 --> 01:05:09,973
That's what he is. That's who he is.

1092
01:05:12,276 --> 01:05:13,971
She must care about him a lot.

1093
01:05:14,226 --> 01:05:18,072
She does, she does. I think she's always
been pretty worried about him. You know...

1094
01:05:18,226 --> 01:05:20,149
Deaf baby and everything.

1095
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:22,717
But, I getit. You know, I think he needs support.

1096
01:05:22,726 --> 01:05:28,608
And I think it's hard for anyone
to have kids these days.
Let alone have a deaf kid, or grow up deaf.

1097
01:05:29,066 --> 01:05:30,067
Crazy...

1098
01:05:30,566 --> 01:05:31,567
Do you...?

1099
01:05:31,726 --> 01:05:34,570
Do you think, maybe, cne day...

1100
01:05:35,276 --> 01:05:39,645
Further down the line, of course,
like... you'd want kids? At all? Like...

1101
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:46,529
Like, further down the track...
Do you see yourself...
having a little Courtney or a...

1102
01:05:47,066 --> 01:05:48,591
Alittle Man-Courtney?

1103
01:05:48,606 --> 01:05:50,438
- Alittle Man-Courtney!
- Alittle Man-Courtney?

1104
01:05:50,936 --> 01:05:54,031
Um... Yeah. No, I would. I would like kids...

1105
01:05:54,186 --> 01:05:58,521
<i>But, I don't know. Again, with Derek...
Like, Dad was deaf so...</i>

1106
01:05:58,526 --> 01:06:01,063
...I'think it's hereditary and...

1107
01:06:01,936 --> 01:06:05,315
You know, marriage and kids and
everything sounds really good, but it's...

1108
01:06:05,526 --> 01:06:07,221
...kinda stressful as well.

1109
01:06:07,226 --> 01:06:08,227
Yep.

1110
01:06:11,436 --> 01:06:12,437
Do you want kids?

1111
01:06:15,316 --> 01:06:16,317
Maybe.

1112
01:06:18,146 --> 01:06:19,147
Maybe, eh?

1113
01:06:23,356 --> 01:06:24,357
Maybe.

1114
01:08:14,436 --> 01:08:16,359

J Forever, my favourite regret J

1121
01:08:49,896 --> 01:08:52,228
What are you deing, Gareth?

1122
01:09:02,106 --> 01:09:03,392
You're nearly through it!

1123
01:09:03,976 --> 01:09:05,353
Yes, it's quite an easy read.

1124
01:09:05,726 --> 01:09:08,434
Aside from some spelling and
punctuation here and there, it was...

1125
01:09:08,776 --> 01:09:10,278
...actually quite polished.

1126
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,933
Are you sure this is the same version
you gave the original proofreader?

1127
01:09:13,106 --> 01:09:14,358
- Mmhm.

1128
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:18,187
Don't do that.

1129
01:09:19,976 --> 01:09:21,432
You're a grown man, Reuben.

1130
01:09:22,646 --> 01:09:23,647
Mum...

1131
01:09:26,436 --> 01:09:28,689
Why didn't you have more
children when you had me?

1132
01:09:31,726 --> 01:09:34,980
When a woman has an abortion,
or a miscarriage

1133
01:09:35,566 --> 01:09:36,897
...or a stillbirth...

1134
01:09:37,226 --> 01:09:38,648
...the womb knows.

1135
01:09:39,106 --> 01:09:40,892
And the next baby would sense that.

1136
01:09:42,276 --> 01:09:46,474
Imagine growing in a place that lacked safety,
surrounded by worry and fear all the time.

1137
01:09:48,186 --> 01:09:49,859
Do you think that's why I have a stutter?

1138
01:09:50,106 --> 01:09:51,107
Don't be silly.

1139
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:54,069
I never had an abortion ora
miscarriage before I had you!

1140
01:09:54,186 --> 01:09:57,770
When I was growing up, I would snuggle up to
you on the couch and you would never hug be back!

1141
01:09:57,776 --> 01:09:58,766
L knew it!

1142
01:09:58,776 --> 01:10:00,517
When I reached that scene, I nearly saw red!

1143
01:10:00,526 --> 01:10:02,346
I'm only building a character based on what I know.

1144
01:10:02,356 --> 01:10:06,680
No! You don't know the first thing about what a
woman goes through when she has a stillbirth!

1145
01:10:06,686 --> 01:10:08,814
Let alone when it's twins!

1146
01:10:09,106 --> 01:10:13,441
And... I'm sorry if that disqualifies
me from being Mother of the Year!

1147
01:10:13,726 --> 01:10:17,151
Mum! I was only basing a stage
play, based oh my own experience!

1148
01:10:18,816 --> 01:10:19,817
Look right here.

1149
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:21,135
See this?

1150
01:10:21,146 --> 01:10:21,305
This is a comprehensive list of
everything that you are entitled to...

1151
01:10:21,316 --> 01:10:24,092
This is a comprehensive list of
everything that you are entitled to...

1152
01:10:24,106 --> 01:10:26,529
<i>- Oh, come on!
- ... and which the world owes you!</i>

1153
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:28,801
Mum, I was just --

1154
01:10:28,816 --> 01:10:29,817
[door slams]

1155
01:10:30,106 --> 01:10:31,426
Reuben, stop!

1156
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,768
Now, why did you go and
write that play about us?

1157
01:10:33,776 --> 01:10:34,891
It wasn't for you!

1158
01:10:34,896 --> 01:10:35,897
Stop.

1159
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,807
Didn't you think that we'd find out?

1160
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:41,172
It wasn't for you to find out,
it was for my own catharsis as a writer!

1161
01:10:41,186 --> 01:10:43,974
For the amateur theatre people,
which you never come to see anyway!

1162
01:10:44,276 --> 01:10:46,552
- Ortoseeme--
- Just slow down. Take a breath.

1163
01:10:46,566 --> 01:10:49,137
No, Dad! It was for me, not for you!

1164
01:10:49,146 --> 01:10:51,649
L guess - 1 gu - 1 guess I'm not
a good enough writer, am 1?

1165
01:10:54,436 --> 01:10:55,346

1189
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,067
Yes.

1190
01:12:18,686 --> 01:12:20,279
Did you sleep well last night?

1191
01:12:21,276 --> 01:12:24,723
J Stay by my side &

1192
01:12:24,976 --> 01:12:27,070
Then you won't be needing your pants.

1193
01:12:28,026 --> 01:12:31,940
J Stay here tonight

1194
01:12:34,396 --> 01:12:38,435
J Stay by my side

J Stay here tonight, ooh

1198
01:13:33,606 --> 01:13:34,607
[LILLIAN] Now!

1199
01:13:37,026 --> 01:13:38,027
Ugh, now!

1200
01:13:38,776 --> 01:13:39,777
Now?

1201
01:13:40,976 --> 01:13:43,320
[Gareth exerts himself]

1202
01:14:03,646 --> 01:14:04,647

01:14:13,976 --> 01:14:16,399

01:14:25,106 --> 01:14:26,107
[ringtone]

1205
01:14:29,186 --> 01:14:30,176
Reuben Heywood.

1206
01:14:30,186 --> 01:14:31,631
[GARETH] Ruby, it's Gareth. How're you doin'?

1207
01:14:31,646 --> 01:14:33,341
[GARETH] You haven't been
answering your phone...

1208
01:14:33,356 --> 01:14:35,893
...I thought, maybe you've
been screening your calls.

1209
01:14:36,276 --> 01:14:39,029
Uh, I hope our little quarrel
last week didn't upset ya?

1210
01:14:39,276 --> 01:14:41,278
No, I've been, um...

1211
01:14:41,776 --> 01:14:42,777
...job hunting.

1212
01:14:43,276 --> 01:14:46,632
[GARETH] Oh! Oh, uh, that's not going to distract
you from the film tee much, is it?

1213
01:14:46,646 --> 01:14:48,671
[GARETH] Hey, I could get another director, or...

1214
01:14:48,686 --> 01:14:51,633
[GARETH] ... in fact, I could bump an A.D.
in to direct, if you can't handle it.

1215
01:14:51,646 --> 01:14:53,353
N-n-no. It's fine...

1216
01:14:53,776 --> 01:14:54,777
I've got it.

1217
01:14:55,106 --> 01:14:56,392
Okay. Cool, yeah, great.

1218
01:14:56,476 --> 01:14:57,819
Great. Listen, um...

1219
01:14:58,526 --> 01:15:01,439
I need you to change one of
the roles to suit Shelley Astor.

1220
01:15:01,856 --> 01:15:02,857
[REUBEN] In "The Burden of Being Me"?

1221
01:15:02,976 --> 01:15:06,719
Yeah, she just cleaned up at the Young Talent
Music Awards and there's murmurings...

1222
01:15:06,726 --> 01:15:08,728
...that she's looking for film
roles. What do you think?

1223
01:15:09,436 --> 01:15:10,722
But why for this film?

1224
01:15:10,726 --> 01:15:13,639
I mean, it's a story about two gay guys
and Shane, who you're playing.

1225
01:15:13,646 --> 01:15:14,977
There's just no role for her.

1226
01:15:15,396 --> 01:15:17,569
Eh... doesn't matter. We change a role to suit her.

1227
01:15:17,976 --> 01:15:21,321
I think a heterosexual romance has
more marketability anyway.

1228
01:15:22,566 --> 01:15:24,557
That's fine but what about the story that I wrote?

1229
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:28,355
Reuben, you stumbled into the film
industry because you got rejected...

1230
01:15:28,476 --> 01:15:29,898
...from amateur theatre.

1231
01:15:30,226 --> 01:15:33,173
I have all the practical skills
to make this film properly.

1232
01:15:33,186 --> 01:15:35,939
You, pardon me for being blunt, do not.

1233
01:15:36,066 --> 01:15:38,967
I know how professional films work.
I've won the awards.

1234
01:15:38,976 --> 01:15:41,183
Believe me, I know better, okay?

1235
01:15:43,606 --> 01:15:44,687
Are you crying?

1236
01:15:46,606 --> 01:15:47,778
Geez, Rubes.

1237
01:15:48,526 --> 01:15:51,439
Next time you find your balls,
make sure you stick 'em on harder, ckay?

1238
01:15:51,976 --> 01:15:53,398
Oil Lily?

1239
01:15:54,276 --> 01:15:55,277
Lil?

1240
01:15:56,476 --> 01:15:57,477
Oi, Lil.

1241
01:15:57,896 --> 01:15:59,569
You'll never guess what just happened.

1242
01:15:59,856 --> 01:16:01,938
I heard. That was nasty.

1243
01:16:02,226 --> 01:16:03,523
What's the matter with you?

1244
01:16:04,566 --> 01:16:06,148
L just had my period.

1245
01:16:06,276 --> 01:16:07,277
Oh!

1246
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:10,149
Well, so, that's a good thing, right?
Because you thought you were...

1247
01:16:10,936 --> 01:16:12,563
...hitting the... change?

1248
01:16:12,646 --> 01:16:15,058
Until this morning, I thought I had missed it.

1249
01:16:15,066 --> 01:16:16,067
Exactly!

1250
01:16:16,436 --> 01:16:19,610
And until this morning, I was happy because...

1251
01:16:19,856 --> 01:16:21,722
...I thought I was pregnant.

1252
01:16:25,226 --> 01:16:26,216
This again!

1253
01:16:26,226 --> 01:16:29,093
Yes! This again! My body's a ticking clock, Gareth!

1254
01:16:29,106 --> 01:16:32,531
Well, maybe you're having trouble conceiving
because you're so stressed about it.

1255
01:16:32,646 --> 01:16:33,636
That's not fair.

1256
01:16:33,646 --> 01:16:34,818
Well, it's still true.

1257
01:16:35,646 --> 01:16:38,399
We're having trouble conceiving!

1258
01:16:38,776 --> 01:16:42,223
L wish you'd start to realize
how important this is to me!

1259
01:16:42,526 --> 01:16:46,064
Lil, do you even think it's fair,
we have a child at our age?

1260
01:16:46,856 --> 01:16:48,847
L want to be a mother.

1261
01:16:48,856 --> 01:16:51,223
Well, great! Just. Not. Now.

1262
01:16:53,476 --> 01:16:59,472
I've given my soul to this marriage and all I'm
asking for is a little physical compensation.

1263
01:16:59,566 --> 01:17:00,556
Huh! Little?

1264
01:17:00,566 --> 01:17:02,853
You're talking about ancther human being.

1265
01:17:04,316 --> 01:17:06,102
Don't you want to leave a legacy?

1266
01:17:16,026 --> 01:17:17,141
I've got an idea.

1267
01:17:17,816 --> 01:17:18,806
Oh, yeah?

1268
01:17:18,816 --> 01:17:22,639
Yeah, you draw me up a contract for Reuben,
giving me full rights to the script...

1269
01:17:22,646 --> 01:17:24,774
...inall territories, in perpetuity.

1270
01:17:25,686 --> 01:17:28,394
Oh, wow. That's a big call. Will he accept that?

1271
01:17:28,646 --> 01:17:33,026
Well, he'll have to if we stand a chance of getting
this one last movie made. And then...

1272
01:17:33,276 --> 01:17:34,937
We can stop racing the clock...

1273
01:17:35,146 --> 01:17:36,523
You can have your baby...

1274
01:17:37,186 --> 01:17:38,859
And I get to go out on top!

1275
01:17:39,276 --> 01:17:40,277
L see!

1276
01:17:40,726 --> 01:17:42,273
What about compensation?

1277
01:17:42,436 --> 01:17:43,426
Compensation, for --

1278
01:17:43,436 --> 01:17:44,938
Ch, Reuben! Yeah, uh...

1279
01:17:45,646 --> 01:17:49,025
10% of the budget should
cushion the little princess.

1280
01:17:50,436 --> 01:17:51,938
So, what you're saying is...

1281
01:17:52,146 --> 01:17:55,650
As long as you get what you want,
I can get what I want?

1282
01:17:59,186 --> 01:18:00,529
I'd like nothing more.

1283
01:18:04,566 --> 01:18:06,898
At least what I want won't take a miracle.

1284
01:18:07,186 --> 01:18:12,272
2l am all of everything

1285
01:18:12,606 --> 01:18:15,462
Jlam east and west

1286
01:18:15,476 --> 01:18:16,932

1287
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:22,771
2l am wind and I'm the sea

1288
01:18:22,976 --> 01:18:26,719
2 Oh, it's I who loves you best &

1289
01:18:26,726 --> 01:18:28,967
- Myles! What a surprise!
- Hi.

1290
01:18:28,976 --> 01:18:31,104
You should have called. Courtney is out with Derek.

1291
01:18:31,316 --> 01:18:34,149
Oh, I - I know. I wanted to speak
to you when she wasn't here.

1292
01:18:34,396 --> 01:18:35,932
Sounds serious, come in.

1293
01:18:37,396 --> 01:18:39,057
You know I love Courtney, so much.

1294
01:18:39,066 --> 01:18:41,068
Yes, anybody can see that.

1295
01:18:41,686 --> 01:18:46,681
And I know she's had a really hard time this last
year with her business failing and everything...

1296
01:18:46,896 --> 01:18:50,480
But... l was thinking now
might be the right time to...

1297
01:18:51,396 --> 01:18:52,522
Faye...

1298
01:18:53,226 --> 01:18:54,716
I would like to ask Courtney to marry me.

1299
01:18:54,726 --> 01:18:56,683
Far out! And you want my blessing?

1300
01:18:56,936 --> 01:18:58,279
And to ask a favour.

1301
01:18:58,856 --> 01:19:00,108
Yes?

1302
01:19:00,606 --> 01:19:04,395
Well, Courtney's probably going to want to have
the wedding in Bali or Vanuatu or something...

1303
01:19:04,526 --> 01:19:06,722
...and I realize, not everyone's equipped to do that.

1304
01:19:06,856 --> 01:19:11,464
So I was thinking, we could
stage a surprise party here;
invite all her friends, some photographers...

1305
01:19:11,476 --> 01:19:13,399
...and I could propose in the middle of the party.

1306
01:19:13,686 --> 01:19:16,610
That scunds absclutely inspired, I love it!

1307
01:19:17,106 --> 01:19:19,108
- Also. ..
- Mm?

1308
01:19:19,356 --> 01:19:23,224
Having now met Matthew, I don't
suppose he'd like to make either journey.

1309
01:19:24,396 --> 01:19:27,070
No, I'm afraid Matthew's quite set in his ways.

1310
01:19:27,276 --> 01:19:31,474
Well, I was thinking that I could
setup alive video stream to him...

1311
01:19:31,646 --> 01:19:32,977
...with your permission, of course.

1312
01:19:33,476 --> 01:19:35,478
So, it would be like he's here, but he's not here.

1313
01:19:35,726 --> 01:19:37,820
Would I have to interact with him in any way?

1314
01:19:38,186 --> 01:19:40,518
No, it'd just be like he's watching
asurveillance tape.

1315
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:42,893
Of his daughter's wedding propesal?

1316
01:19:43,226 --> 01:19:44,227
Pretty much, yeah.

1317
01:19:45,026 --> 01:19:46,096
Myles Bradford!

1318
01:19:46,106 --> 01:19:48,052
You are a gentleman and a scholar!

1319
01:19:48,066 --> 01:19:51,024
And a solicitously brilliant romantic!

1320
01:19:51,276 --> 01:19:53,973
I'd be pleased to help you crganize the party and...

1321
01:19:54,526 --> 01:19:57,211
I wish you and Courtney many
blessed years together!

1322
01:19:57,226 --> 01:19:58,227
Thank you.

1323
01:19:58,356 --> 01:20:00,688
Thank you! Thank you, Faye!

1324
01:20:01,526 --> 01:20:06,271
J When you're at the end of an end

1325
01:20:06,396 --> 01:20:11,106
2l am all of everything

1326
01:20:12,186 --> 01:20:17,647
Jlam all of everything &

1327
01:20:21,816 --> 01:20:22,817
oh, Lily!

1328
01:20:23,186 --> 01:20:24,347
Sorry, I didn't see you there!

1329
01:20:24,356 --> 01:20:26,108
I have the contract you asked for.

1330
01:20:27,566 --> 01:20:28,567
Thanks, Hun.

1331
01:20:30,936 --> 01:20:32,779
What were you deing?

1332
01:20:33,936 --> 01:20:36,428
Uh, just... learning to sign.

1333
01:20:36,436 --> 01:20:37,437


1334
01:20:37,606 --> 01:20:41,895
L'just think the romantic lead would be
a better role for me if I aged him up a bit.

1335
01:20:42,476 --> 01:20:43,386
Oh...

1336
01:20:43,396 --> 01:20:47,344
So, you'll be giving up the
role of Shane for the role of...

1337
01:20:47,356 --> 01:20:49,779
...Rebin, but... making him older?

1338
01:20:51,816 --> 01:20:54,262
I'm geing to combine Shane
and Robin into one juicy role.

1339
01:20:54,276 --> 01:20:55,471
I think it'd be better then.

1340
01:20:55,816 --> 01:20:57,318
- For the film, you mean?
- Yeah, yeah.

1341
01:20:59,026 --> 01:21:03,133
So, you'd be playing the role of the guy
with the stutter, but making him straight...

1342
01:21:03,146 --> 01:21:05,353
...and also aging him up?

1343
01:21:05,646 --> 01:21:06,716
That's actually quite compelling.

1344
01:21:06,726 --> 01:21:09,855
L can see you making a comeback
with a role that complex!

1345
01:21:10,026 --> 01:21:12,802
<i>Are you actually going to make him
ahomophobe, the way Shane is, as well?</i>

1346
01:21:12,816 --> 01:21:14,602
Ch, nah, I'm gonna get rid of that bullshit.

1347
01:21:15,066 --> 01:21:16,215
L just think it'd be better if...

1348
01:21:16,226 --> 01:21:18,718
...the audience identified with the character,

1349
01:21:18,726 --> 01:21:21,605
and far better if they could
understand what he was saying, if...

1350
01:21:22,186 --> 01:21:23,608
...he was a straight guy,

1351
01:21:23,816 --> 01:21:25,022
that got tongue-tied.

1352
01:21:25,436 --> 01:21:28,360
So, what makes him so "tongue-tied"?

1353
01:21:28,566 --> 01:21:29,397
Ah!

1354
01:21:36,226 --> 01:21:37,773
Wait, you can't just do that!

1355
01:21:38,276 --> 01:21:40,893
Well, when I have full veto, I can.
I can do whatever I want.

1356
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:42,477
You want a baby, don't you?

1357
01:21:43,976 --> 01:21:45,171
Yes! But...

1358
01:21:45,186 --> 01:21:46,938
Yes, but what?

1359
01:21:47,896 --> 01:21:48,897
Well...

1360
01:21:50,856 --> 01:21:52,312
I think it's the...

1361
01:21:52,686 --> 01:21:57,351
...dynamic of the guy with the stutter and
his deaf partner that give the film its, um...

1362
01:21:57,976 --> 01:22:01,776
...its social commentary and
its, um... moral compass.

1363
01:22:02,976 --> 01:22:03,977
Yeah?

1364
01:22:04,066 --> 01:22:06,433
And the girl. As lovely as she is...

1365
01:22:06,646 --> 01:22:07,647
...could...

1366
01:22:08,316 --> 01:22:11,354
...could be his, um... his sister? You know?

1367
01:22:12,606 --> 01:22:14,882
...l suppose I could do that. But...

1368
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:18,025
I don't even know if Shelley's going
to do the role. I guess I could ask her.

1369
01:22:18,606 --> 01:22:22,019
Aw, it would really boost my
star-power if we collaborated, though!

1370
01:22:22,026 --> 01:22:24,723
Ooh! Imagine that. Wow.

1371
01:22:25,646 --> 01:22:26,932
But why on this project?

1372
01:22:27,646 --> 01:22:32,686
"The Burden of Being Me"
is a such a powerful and dynamic story.

1373
01:22:32,856 --> 01:22:34,858
Why not collaborate with this, um...

1374
01:22:35,856 --> 01:22:37,779
...Shelley Astor...

1375
01:22:38,646 --> 01:22:41,183
...oh something you actually care about?

1376
01:22:42,026 --> 01:22:44,814
Something about a beautiful
singer that shows off her big...

1377
01:22:44,936 --> 01:22:46,028
...voice! You know?

1378
01:22:46,186 --> 01:22:50,191
Lily! You're overloading my brain!
Can't you see I'm trying to rehearse?

1379
01:22:50,396 --> 01:22:51,602
Now, go away!

1380
01:22:52,396 --> 01:22:54,398
The truth doesn't need to be "rehearsed".

1381
01:22:57,816 --> 01:22:58,817
[ringtone]

1382
01:23:03,066 --> 01:23:04,067
Hello?

1383
01:23:06,396 --> 01:23:07,397
She is?

1384
01:23:08,146 --> 01:23:09,853
Oh, my God, that is fantastic -- no.

1385
01:23:10,476 --> 01:23:13,070
Thank you. When? Oh, uh, where - where? Where?

1386
01:23:13,856 --> 01:23:15,722
Yep, yep. Oh, ckay. Ch!

1387
01:23:15,936 --> 01:23:18,439
I'll be there. Thank you.
Thank you! Thank you so much!

1388
01:23:18,646 --> 01:23:19,772
Okay, bye now!

1389
01:23:19,976 --> 01:23:20,977
Bye!

1390
01:23:22,816 --> 01:23:23,601
Who was that?

1391
01:23:28,106 --> 01:23:29,358
Shelley's agent!

1392
01:23:29,816 --> 01:23:32,353
She wants to meet and talk
to me about doing the film!

1393
01:23:46,526 --> 01:23:47,527
Oh!

1394
01:23:47,816 --> 01:23:50,808
Good morning, Mr. Donahue!
I'm... I'm such an avid fan.

1395
01:23:50,816 --> 01:23:52,591
No, I am a big fan. Really, truly.

1396
01:23:52,606 --> 01:23:54,108
Sit, please. Sit, sit.

1397
01:23:55,066 --> 01:23:57,808
Um, my publicist is over there by the bar...

1398
01:23:57,816 --> 01:24:00,319
...ll was hoping we could get a drink shortly, or...?

1399
01:24:00,816 --> 01:24:02,341
Yeah! Well - well... Absolutely!

1400
01:24:02,356 --> 01:24:04,882
Anything! Look, anything you want. I'm just so...

1401
01:24:04,896 --> 01:24:08,184
...excited to have the opportunity
to work with you. It's...!

1402
01:24:08,686 --> 01:24:11,439
Yes! Now, tell me about this film of yours.

1403
01:24:12,436 --> 01:24:17,067
Did you know that this is the
sign for shell? As in Shelley?

1404
01:24:18,106 --> 01:24:19,346
I'm a singer, Gareth.

1405
01:24:19,356 --> 01:24:22,178
The deaf are hardly my target demographic.

1406
01:24:22,186 --> 01:24:23,381
Ch, no, no, no.

1407
01:24:23,396 --> 01:24:24,818
That's just it!

1408
01:24:26,276 --> 01:24:27,641
L'am inspired...

1409
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:30,319
...tointroduce you to the silver screen...

1410
01:24:30,646 --> 01:24:34,480
...inthe most unpredictable
characterisation you could think of;

1411
01:24:35,726 --> 01:24:36,978
As a singer...

1412
01:24:37,396 --> 01:24:39,353
...who falls in love with a deaf man!

1413
01:24:39,816 --> 01:24:42,092
Ah, that's... that's fascinating!

1414
01:24:42,106 --> 01:24:43,892
Are - are you writing or directing it?

1415
01:24:44,186 --> 01:24:46,644
Well, I'm... I'm definitely producing, but, um...

1416
01:24:47,276 --> 01:24:48,766
...l could write and direct, I suppose.

1417
01:24:48,776 --> 01:24:49,675
You haven't written it yet?

1418
01:24:49,686 --> 01:24:53,316
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's... I've written it.
It's just, uh, I need to make seme, uh...

1419
01:24:53,476 --> 01:24:54,557
Just... minor adjustments.

1420
01:24:54,566 --> 01:24:56,068
Oh! Right, okay.

1421
01:24:56,276 --> 01:24:57,846
It's, uh... You look lovely, by the way.

1422
01:24:57,856 --> 01:24:58,846
Oh, thank you.

1423
01:24:58,856 --> 01:25:00,802
I really love the album too! It's just...

1424
01:25:00,816 --> 01:25:02,898
Thanks! I'm pretty excited about it.

1425
01:25:07,646 --> 01:25:08,556
Reuben!

1426
01:25:08,566 --> 01:25:09,567
My good man!

1427
01:25:09,776 --> 01:25:11,926
Ay, thanks for coming around.
I know how you like to communicate...

1428
01:25:11,936 --> 01:25:15,281
...with text and email but I can't
stand all that crap, besides --

1429
01:25:15,436 --> 01:25:19,134
-- time is of the essence. I think I've
finally solved our little problem.

1430
01:25:19,146 --> 01:25:20,318
Come onin, come on in!

1431
01:25:21,856 --> 01:25:22,857
Reuben...

1432
01:25:24,776 --> 01:25:25,777
...meet Peter Raymond.

1433
01:25:25,976 --> 01:25:28,650
He's going to play the role of Drake in
"The Burden of Being Me"!

1434
01:25:29,396 --> 01:25:31,216
But that's Derek's role. He needs to be deaf.

1435
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:32,398
He is deaf!

1436
01:25:32,566 --> 01:25:33,931
Isn't that great?

1437
01:25:34,226 --> 01:25:35,352
Lily found him.

1438
01:25:35,526 --> 01:25:38,143
Well, actually, his disability support worker...

1439
01:25:38,186 --> 01:25:41,360
...uh, hired Lily to prosecute the
drama school, when they wouldn't...

1440
01:25:41,476 --> 01:25:44,719
...change the course to suit his needs.
But she's very good. She won, of course.

1441
01:25:44,726 --> 01:25:46,603
Oh, I've got some paper work for you to sign.

1442
01:25:46,816 --> 01:25:47,817
But, why?

1443
01:25:48,026 --> 01:25:51,394
Think about it, right. The
deafness in our script is good...

1444
01:25:51,776 --> 01:25:53,392
...but having a character...

1445
01:25:53,526 --> 01:25:56,928
...that's deaf and has cerebral palsy
just knocks it out of the park!

1446
01:25:56,936 --> 01:25:58,267
For originality, den't you think?

1447
01:25:58,276 --> 01:26:01,268
What about my character?
The one w-w-with the stutter?

1448
01:26:01,276 --> 01:26:03,392
Oh, yeah, yeah, I want to talk to you about that one.

1449
01:26:03,646 --> 01:26:05,683
I 'haven't told you yet, so brace yourself.

1450
01:26:06,856 --> 01:26:11,601
I've managed to secure Shelley
Astor to play the role...

1451
01:26:11,606 --> 01:26:14,314
...of Robyn. Robin, witha Y.

1452
01:26:14,726 --> 01:26:16,137
But Robin's my character!

1453
01:26:16,146 --> 01:26:18,649
What, no, no, no, no! Not anymore.

1454
01:26:18,726 --> 01:26:21,468
She's a singer who falls in love with a deaf man...

1455
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:24,013
. only, his estranged father, Shane, gets in --

1456
01:26:24,026 --> 01:26:25,516
But-but-but-but you're playing Shane!

1457
01:26:25,526 --> 01:26:27,016
Yeah, yeah, I'm playing Shane.

1458
01:26:27,026 --> 01:26:30,178
He tries to break them up, their romance,
because he's a- he's a jealous dad.

1459
01:26:30,186 --> 01:26:31,301
But don't worry, I've...

1460
01:26:31,316 --> 01:26:35,810
I've written him just as, uh, nasty and as
relatable as you originally intended.

1461
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:38,478
No, you haven't! You've just
hijacked my whole story!

1462
01:26:41,976 --> 01:26:43,819
Uh... What do you think?

1463
01:26:45,026 --> 01:26:45,686
[loud thumping]

1464
01:26:46,726 --> 01:26:49,024
Hey, hey! Don't cut me out of this conversation!

1465
01:27:07,476 --> 01:27:08,853
You, see... Reuben...

1466
01:27:09,146 --> 01:27:14,061
Able-bodied actors get Oscars for playing
characters like Peter with authenticity.

1467
01:27:15,226 --> 01:27:16,591
We've got the real thing!

1468
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:19,189
- And Shelley Astor?
- Yes! And Shelley Astor!

1469
01:27:19,726 --> 01:27:22,593
But that's another complication!
Why would you want to complicate things?

1470
01:27:22,606 --> 01:27:24,028
Complications?

1471
01:27:24,226 --> 01:27:26,058
You think Peter is a complication?

1472
01:27:26,066 --> 01:27:27,773
In this instance, yes!

1473
01:27:27,896 --> 01:27:31,150
It's still a love story involving a deaf man!

1474
01:27:31,526 --> 01:27:35,463
You've got to be more grateful for what you've got
and you've got to be more
flexible with your rigid ideas.

1475
01:27:35,476 --> 01:27:36,386
I don't believe this!

1476
01:27:36,396 --> 01:27:39,593
Oh, okay, you're just butt-hurt
that's not a queer love story!

1477
01:27:39,606 --> 01:27:40,846
Is that what's got your goat? Hey?

1478
01:27:40,856 --> 01:27:42,096
Not at all! Gareth!

1479
01:27:42,106 --> 01:27:43,107
Reuben!

1480
01:27:44,186 --> 01:27:47,190
Let me give you some advice, ckay?

1481
01:27:47,936 --> 01:27:50,064
Make the changes to the script.

1482
01:27:50,396 --> 01:27:52,273
Sign on the dotted line.

1483
01:27:52,856 --> 01:27:56,315
And then let's make this movie
that's sc important to you.

1484
01:27:57,776 --> 01:27:58,777
Okay?

1485
01:28:01,896 --> 01:28:02,897
Okay?

1486
01:28:04,526 --> 01:28:05,527
Okay...

1487
01:28:06,356 --> 01:28:07,357
Okay!

1488
01:28:16,276 --> 01:28:19,428
It's no accident that the face
is the same size as your hand.

1489
01:28:19,436 --> 01:28:21,359
Perfect for face-palming.

1490
01:28:23,856 --> 01:28:28,271
But, I'm reading through the contract
and Peter has a point.

1491
01:28:28,686 --> 01:28:33,647
This film could get a lot of praise
and recognition for its uniqueness.

1492
01:28:37,776 --> 01:28:38,777
[ringtone]

1493
01:28:40,356 --> 01:28:41,357
It's Gareth.

1494
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:49,266
Hello, Gareth?

1495
01:28:49,276 --> 01:28:50,266
Reuben!

1496
01:28:50,276 --> 01:28:51,266
Yeah, yeah, how are ya?

1497
01:28:51,276 --> 01:28:53,142
Yeah, ook, lock, have you signed that contract?

1498
01:28:53,186 --> 01:28:56,645
You mean the one where I sign over
100% of the - of - of my story to you?

1499
01:28:59,936 --> 01:29:01,643
No, I haven't signed it.

1500
01:29:01,816 --> 01:29:03,773
Well, shit, Reuben. What are you waiting for?

1501
01:29:04,186 --> 01:29:05,847
We've got Shelley Astor on board...

1502
01:29:05,856 --> 01:29:08,848
...we've got all the proposals for
The Australian Screen Fund...

1503
01:29:08,856 --> 01:29:11,177
...The Film Finance of New South Wales,
The Sydney Screen Company...

1504
01:29:11,186 --> 01:29:13,860
...they're all ready to go.
Do you want funding or not?

1505
01:29:14,976 --> 01:29:18,105
Why am I signing over 100% of
creative control to you, again?

1506
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,529
That's how it's done.

1507
01:29:19,816 --> 01:29:22,422
The writer grants the producer full veto rights.

1508
01:29:22,436 --> 01:29:26,350
The funding bodies pay the budget to the producer
because they're reliable and bankable...

1509
01:29:26,356 --> 01:29:28,211
...and promise a return on their investment.

1510
01:29:28,226 --> 01:29:30,399
It's industry standard. Trust me.

1511
01:29:30,686 --> 01:29:31,676
But...

1512
01:29:31,686 --> 01:29:34,030
But Derek says I should have it
checked over by a professional.

1513
01:29:34,226 --> 01:29:35,728
Well, yeah, how soon can you do that?

1514
01:29:35,936 --> 01:29:40,567
No! No, no, that's... uh, there's not encugh time.
You've got to sign it and scan it, now!

1515
01:29:43,066 --> 01:29:45,319
Reuben, I have to deliver the contract by...

1516
01:29:45,856 --> 01:29:46,937
. dpm.

1517
01:29:47,026 --> 01:29:48,027
Why 4pm?

1518
01:29:48,566 --> 01:29:50,102
Well, look, it's something about...

1519
01:29:50,476 --> 01:29:52,649
...submissions. I dunno. It's...

1520
01:29:52,816 --> 01:29:56,343
<i>They probably want the information so they can
collate it before the end of business day.</i>

1521
01:29:56,356 --> 01:29:59,428
I haven't told you befere, Reuben,
because I know how you hate...

1522
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:03,191
...getting stressed about these things.
But I can't wait any longer.

1523
01:30:03,726 --> 01:30:06,070
You have to sign it, right now!

1524
01:30:13,436 --> 01:30:15,928
I really don't like making demands on people.

1525
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,392
Okay, but I must insist.

1526
01:30:17,776 --> 01:30:19,107
Trust me.

1527
01:30:19,566 --> 01:30:21,591
You don't need to read the fine print.

1528
01:30:21,606 --> 01:30:22,846
There's no time for it, anyway.

1529
01:30:22,856 --> 01:30:26,929
Besides, it's just a standard agreement.
The real agreement, like I said...

1530
01:30:26,936 --> 01:30:28,392
...is between you and me.

1531
01:30:28,606 --> 01:30:30,517
So, what is "our agreement"?

1532
01:30:30,526 --> 01:30:32,813
[GARETH] Oh, geez, Reuben, we've been over this.

1533
01:30:32,976 --> 01:30:34,978
Look, our agreement is;

1534
01:30:35,106 --> 01:30:37,928
That we're going to make your
story into a film. Have it your way.

1535
01:30:37,936 --> 01:30:39,961
Your cast, your choice of crew...

1536
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:43,685
...and at the end of the day, we split it 50/50.
And I promise you...

1537
01:30:44,526 --> 01:30:49,430
...that all that bullying and rejection that you
grew up with with culminate
into the biggest and best...

1538
01:30:49,436 --> 01:30:49,470
<i>...that all that bullying and rejection that you
grew up with with culminate
into the biggest and best...
... trlumph of your life!</i>

1539
01:30:49,476 --> 01:30:51,319
...triumph of your life!

1540
01:30:52,026 --> 01:30:58,352
What did you say about... Shelley Astor?
And Peter Raymond? And the investors? And...

1541
01:30:59,226 --> 01:31:00,648
.can I still use Derek?

1542
01:31:01,776 --> 01:31:03,312
You want this, don't you, Reuben?

1543
01:31:04,686 --> 01:31:09,522
Think of all those bully's
taunts. Count up all the times
you've been teased for your stutter...

1544
01:31:09,526 --> 01:31:12,393
...or wearing glasses or
being a sensitive little soul.

1545
01:31:12,526 --> 01:31:14,711
You wanna make this movie, don't you?

1546
01:31:14,726 --> 01:31:17,468
You want to show those turkeys up, don't you?
What are you waiting for?

1547
01:31:17,476 --> 01:31:19,968
We're on a deadline, Reuben!

1548
01:31:19,976 --> 01:31:24,220
We only get this chance once and everything
is in perfect alignment, in this moment!

1549
01:31:24,226 --> 01:31:27,139
Shelley is a massive star!
And you've got me!

1550
01:31:27,146 --> 01:31:28,853
Who's going to help you, Reuben?

1551
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:31,012
What's going to happen now...

1552
01:31:31,026 --> 01:31:32,528
...if you don't trust me?

1553
01:31:38,026 --> 01:31:39,027
Okay.

1554
01:31:42,066 --> 01:31:43,067
Okay?

1555
01:31:44,276 --> 01:31:45,277
Okay...

1556
01:31:56,526 --> 01:31:59,143
I'm sending you the contract now.

1557
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:10,064
[GARETH] Good bey, Reuben. Talk to you later.

1558
01:32:29,226 --> 01:32:31,979
L see you really twisted his arm on that one.

1559
01:32:32,396 --> 01:32:35,354
It's all a bit... really... Darwinian, isn't it?

1560
01:32:36,976 --> 01:32:39,354
Did you even mean a word of what you just said?

1561
01:32:39,896 --> 01:32:40,897
Oh, Lillian...

1562
01:32:41,476 --> 01:32:45,526
You can't maintain a nice garden without
spreading a little bit of bullshit around.

1563
01:32:46,436 --> 01:32:47,437
L see.

1564
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:49,647
Look, Hun...

1565
01:32:49,896 --> 01:32:52,979
I'm net normally insensitive, but when I am...

1566
01:32:54,226 --> 01:32:55,853
...he'll get over it.

1567
01:32:59,526 --> 01:33:00,527
[ringtone]

1568
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:06,307
Hello?

1569
01:33:06,316 --> 01:33:09,775
Reuben, hey! It's... it's Doug.

1570
01:33:10,726 --> 01:33:11,727
Um...

1571
01:33:12,606 --> 01:33:16,031
Look, I'm not sure how to break
this to you, so I'm just genna...

1572
01:33:17,726 --> 01:33:21,060
...Il glanced at the contact you sent me.

1573
01:33:21,066 --> 01:33:22,067
And...

1574
01:33:23,186 --> 01:33:26,724
...well, I'm kind of having trouble
understanding why you signed it.

1575
01:33:27,526 --> 01:33:28,607
What do you -- what do you mean?

1576
01:33:29,396 --> 01:33:30,397
Well...

1577
01:33:30,896 --> 01:33:33,103
Did you even read it before signing it?

1578
01:33:34,896 --> 01:33:35,897
Why?

1579
01:33:37,146 --> 01:33:38,147
It's just...

1580
01:33:39,106 --> 01:33:40,892
I mean, I've never seen anything like it.

1581
01:33:41,276 --> 01:33:44,894
The contract is so heavily
biased in Gareth's favour.

1582
01:33:44,976 --> 01:33:45,977
It's like...

1583
01:33:46,776 --> 01:33:49,723
It's like you've literally signed your life away.

1584
01:33:51,066 --> 01:33:56,561
He said it was standard industry practice
for a producer to have full rights to a film.

1585
01:33:58,686 --> 01:34:00,393
Hm, well, there's truth in that, but...

1586
01:34:01,396 --> 01:34:04,400
I mean, there's nothing in there
about upfront compensation.

1587
01:34:04,856 --> 01:34:05,857
There's a...

1588
01:34:06,526 --> 01:34:10,975
...aclause that alludes to "10% of the budget",
but you don't have a budget in place yet.

1589
01:34:11,526 --> 01:34:12,527
And...

1590
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:16,883
...then it goes on to say that the
producer has complete and utter jurisdiction...

1591
01:34:16,896 --> 01:34:19,854
...to change and edit whatever
he wants at any given time.

1592
01:34:20,816 --> 01:34:22,181
What does that mean for me?

1593
01:34:24,146 --> 01:34:29,562
Well, it means that you'll only see your 10%
if Gareth produces the film you've written.

1594
01:34:36,106 --> 01:34:37,107
He won't.

1595
01:34:38,856 --> 01:34:40,972
He means to change the entire thing.

1596
01:34:43,526 --> 01:34:44,527
Yep...

1597
01:34:44,896 --> 01:34:47,433
...that's pretty clear in the
language of the contract.

1598
01:34:49,066 --> 01:34:50,932
Do you think he'll keep you on as a writer?

1599
01:34:51,816 --> 01:34:52,817
Maybe...

1600
01:34:55,316 --> 01:34:57,068
Reuben, you should have read this thing.

1601
01:34:58,146 --> 01:35:00,649
I know you and you take people at face value.

1602
01:35:00,726 --> 01:35:02,319
You want to trust, but...

1603
01:35:03,856 --> 01:35:05,858
Man, you've signed a deal with the devil.

1604
01:35:09,976 --> 01:35:12,388
- This is why I need you to help
with the fees, so you can...
- Oh my God!

1605
01:35:12,396 --> 01:35:15,422
...l don't know what's more stupid.
The terms of this garbage...

1606
01:35:15,436 --> 01:35:16,881
...orthe fact that you signed it!

1607
01:35:16,896 --> 01:35:18,591
- But Mum, I --
- Having read your original screenplay...

1608
01:35:18,606 --> 01:35:22,270
...I thought it was in quite horrible taste to base
those characters on your father and l.

1609
01:35:22,276 --> 01:35:24,802
- Maybe if you --
- And this! This is precisely what happens to films...

1610
01:35:24,816 --> 01:35:26,306
...based on nasty intentions.

1611
01:35:26,316 --> 01:35:28,557
- Maybe if you --
- You end up signing contacts like this!

1612
01:35:28,566 --> 01:35:30,842
Maybe if you took more interest in my writing,
you'd understand I had to --

1613
01:35:30,856 --> 01:35:34,065
No, no. Stop, look. All right,
we're not in a position...

1614
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:35,966
...to fund your legal fees.

1615
01:35:35,976 --> 01:35:39,526
- But, Dad!
- No, no, you're going to have to
take this cne on your chin. Okay?

1616
01:35:39,646 --> 01:35:40,818
It's time you grew up, mate.

1617
01:37:23,726 --> 01:37:25,433
We're rehearsing. What do you want?

1618
01:37:26,566 --> 01:37:28,273
L want to perform in this year's showcase.

1619
01:37:28,896 --> 01:37:29,897
Are you kidding?

1620
01:37:30,186 --> 01:37:32,132
Did you forget that you walked out on us?

1621
01:37:32,146 --> 01:37:35,571
No, I remember... I'm actually making a
film about it, in case you hadn't heard.

1622
01:37:35,726 --> 01:37:37,433
No, I heard.

1623
01:37:37,726 --> 01:37:39,433
Word gets around.

1624
01:37:40,186 --> 01:37:41,859
So, who did you get to play me?

1625
01:37:42,606 --> 01:37:45,689
Nobody, because the film isn't being
made, anyway. At least, not with me.

1626
01:37:45,776 --> 01:37:47,778
- What do you mean?
- Emily, we're waiting for you!

1627
01:37:49,226 --> 01:37:50,682
Ch, Reuben.

1628
01:37:51,896 --> 01:37:52,886
Where's the boyfriend?

1629
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:55,422
Shut up, Blake. The only thing uglier
than your haircut is your personality.

1630
01:37:55,436 --> 01:37:56,437
Uh-uh-uh!

1631
01:37:58,726 --> 01:37:59,727
Reuben.

1632
01:38:00,316 --> 01:38:02,341
Come on, man. That's not the way to make friends.

1633
01:38:02,356 --> 01:38:04,768
Pfftl F-f-f-friends? Wh-w-w-wh-with you twe?

1634
01:38:04,776 --> 01:38:06,346
Look, what are you doing here?

1635
01:38:06,356 --> 01:38:10,680
He only wants to burrow back into the theatre
because he's been kicked out of his own film, Emily.

1636
01:38:10,686 --> 01:38:11,972
- What?
- Yeah!

1637
01:38:11,976 --> 01:38:13,569
That interpreter, Felicity, told me!

1638
01:38:13,646 --> 01:38:16,889
Ch, she heard it from some, uh,
deaf actors Reuben's boyfriend knows.

1639
01:38:16,896 --> 01:38:18,842
Apparently, they were all thinking of boycotting it...

1640
01:38:18,856 --> 01:38:22,133
<i>...until it dawned on them that there
would be more deaf characters...</i>

1641
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:24,513
...and that they could be in the
same film as THE Shelley Astor!

1642
01:38:24,526 --> 01:38:26,972
Oh my Geod, are you for real?

1643
01:38:27,066 --> 01:38:30,513
You know what, guys, just forget it. I'm resigned te
being the victim. I'm pretty used to it!

1644
01:38:30,526 --> 01:38:31,721
- Ugh!
- Reuben!

1645
01:38:32,356 --> 01:38:36,600
Look. If you actually have
a showcase idea in mind...

1646
01:38:36,606 --> 01:38:38,938
- ...I'minterested to see what you have.
- Emily!

1647
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:40,728
Seriously, Blake. Shut up.

1648
01:38:43,646 --> 01:38:44,647
Come on.

1649
01:38:52,276 --> 01:38:53,971
You've rehearsed? You're all prepared?

1650
01:38:54,026 --> 01:38:55,721
L -1 have rehearsed.

1651
01:38:55,816 --> 01:38:56,806
And I'm not nervous at all.

1652
01:38:56,816 --> 01:38:59,057
Good. You are prepared, though?
You've learned your part?

1653
01:38:59,066 --> 01:39:00,056
I'm ready, I'm ready.

1654
01:39:00,066 --> 01:39:03,604
- Okay. I'm sure you'll do fine.
- Mum, please, you're making me --

1655
01:39:13,316 --> 01:39:15,171
Are you all ready for next Saturday night?

1656
01:39:15,186 --> 01:39:17,462
Aw, I wouldn't miss it. I'm so excited.

1657
01:39:17,476 --> 01:39:20,355
Oh, it's going to be a beautiful
surprise proposal party.

1658
01:39:20,436 --> 01:39:21,722
I'm happy to help.

1659
01:39:22,646 --> 01:39:24,432
Uhm... Actually, um...

1660
01:39:26,776 --> 01:39:27,777
Hm, yes, what?

1661
01:39:32,606 --> 01:39:35,644
No, but I expect it'll be scmetime soon, why?

1662
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:50,807
Hm, wow! Very ambitious.

1663
01:39:50,816 --> 01:39:54,150
And I suppose that the lead role
would be perfect for my son?

1664
01:39:59,646 --> 01:40:00,647
No?

1665
01:40:04,316 --> 01:40:05,727
You want me to invest in it?

1666
01:40:07,476 --> 01:40:08,978
My arts grant?!

1667
01:40:10,146 --> 01:40:14,811
The one that I earned through my art-making
practice! The one that I competed for!

1668
01:40:18,726 --> 01:40:21,423
Please, Faye. It's a film about the deaf. And - and...

1669
01:40:21,436 --> 01:40:24,963
...it has Auslanin it and it showcases the
community you've made feel such a part of...

1670
01:40:24,976 --> 01:40:27,092
I'm sorry, Reuben. The answer's no!

1671
01:40:27,106 --> 01:40:31,942
Uh, good evening ladies and gentlemen
and welcome to this evening's showcase.

1672
01:40:32,066 --> 01:40:34,717
Our show will be commencing
in just a few minute's time...

1673
01:40:34,726 --> 01:40:37,809
...soif you could all please
make your way to your seats,

1674
01:40:37,816 --> 01:40:41,309
please ensure that all mobile
devices are switched off,

1675
01:40:41,316 --> 01:40:43,478
and I hope you have an enjoyable evening.

1676
01:40:43,686 --> 01:40:44,687
Thank you.

1677
01:40:57,526 --> 01:40:59,187
[applause]

1678
01:41:02,396 --> 01:41:06,924
Melody's bosom heaved with blunt regret,

1679
01:41:06,936 --> 01:41:11,442
as she stood on the peak of the Irish moor.

1680
01:41:11,776 --> 01:41:19,183
Her corset strangled her aching heart,
as the icy wind stroked...

1681
01:41:19,566 --> 01:41:22,775
...through her thick, chestnut hair.

1682
01:41:23,776 --> 01:41:25,107
She knew...

1683
01:41:25,606 --> 01:41:30,271
...there was an omen in every moment.

1684
01:41:30,686 --> 01:41:35,351
She that this was her moment to choose.

1685
01:41:36,146 --> 01:41:38,023
Satisfaction...

1686
01:41:38,476 --> 01:41:40,319
...or sacrifice.

1687
01:41:41,146 --> 01:41:42,147
Love...

1688
01:41:42,936 --> 01:41:44,358
...or loneliness.

1689
01:41:45,686 --> 01:41:46,687
Life...

1690
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:50,029
...or death.

1691
01:41:51,976 --> 01:41:53,683
[applause]

1692
01:41:57,026 --> 01:42:00,724
That was Blake Rhodes, with his reading of...

1693
01:42:01,186 --> 01:42:05,191
..."An Omen in Every Moment", by Edith Keegan.

1694
01:42:05,856 --> 01:42:07,392
Next up, we have...

1695
01:42:08,316 --> 01:42:10,683
"Feathers From A Thousand Li Away"

1696
01:42:11,026 --> 01:42:14,439
Apassage from "The Joy Luck
Club", written by Amy Tan...

1697
01:42:14,816 --> 01:42:17,228
...and performed by Reuben Heywood.

1698
01:42:19,356 --> 01:42:21,313
{muttering to self)
Hopefully, it won't be as shit.

1699
01:42:23,436 --> 01:42:28,727
<i>"The old woman remembered a swan she'd bought,
years age in... Shanghai for a foolish sum..."</i>

1700
01:42:43,066 --> 01:42:44,067
2 [gentle Oriental music] &

1701
01:42:44,396 --> 01:42:45,773
The old woman remembered...

1702
01:42:45,816 --> 01:42:49,901
...aswan she had bought years
ago in Shanghai for a foolish sum...

1703
01:42:50,896 --> 01:42:53,433
..."this bird," boasted the market vendor...

1704
01:42:53,936 --> 01:42:58,681
..."was once a duck that stretched it neck out
in hopes of someday becoming a goose...

1705
01:42:59,066 --> 01:43:02,104
...and now look, it is too beautiful to eat!"

1706
01:43:02,776 --> 01:43:06,030
So the woman and the swan
sailed across an ocean...

1707
01:43:06,226 --> 01:43:07,853
...many thousands of Li wide...

1708
01:43:09,026 --> 01:43:11,643
...stretching their necks toward America.

1709
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:15,604
On her journey, the woman coced to the swan;

1710
01:43:17,146 --> 01:43:20,400
"In America, I will have a daughter just like me...

1711
01:43:21,356 --> 01:43:27,147
<i>"...bul over there, no one will say her worth is
measured by the loudness of her husband's beleh.</i>

1712
01:43:28,226 --> 01:43:30,934
"Over there, no one will look down on her...

1713
01:43:31,476 --> 01:43:35,185
"...'cause I will make her speak
only perfect American English.

1714
01:43:36,356 --> 01:43:40,941
"And over there, she will be too
full to ever swallow any sorrow.

1715
01:43:42,436 --> 01:43:45,474
"She will know my meaning,
because I will give her this swan.

1716
01:43:45,896 --> 01:43:49,025
"Acreature that became more
than what was hoped for."

1717
01:43:50,776 --> 01:43:53,609
But when the woman arrived in the new country...

1718
01:43:54,526 --> 01:43:57,439
...the immigration officials
took the swan away from her!

1719
01:43:57,726 --> 01:44:00,184
Leaving the woman fluttering her arms...

1720
01:44:01,186 --> 01:44:03,280
...with only a single swan feather...

1721
01:44:03,566 --> 01:44:04,852
...fora memory.

1722
01:44:06,066 --> 01:44:08,558
And she had to fill cut so many forms that...

1723
01:44:08,566 --> 01:44:12,776
...she forgot why she left Shanghai
and why she'd come in the first place.

1724
01:44:15,816 --> 01:44:17,352
Now the woman was old.

1725
01:44:17,526 --> 01:44:20,530
And she had a daughter who
grew up speaking only English...

1726
01:44:20,606 --> 01:44:22,938
...and drinking more Coca-Cola than sorrow.

1727
01:44:24,316 --> 01:44:25,681
Foralong time now...

1728
01:44:26,436 --> 01:44:30,475
...the woman wanted to give her daughter
the single swan feather and tell her;

1729
01:44:31,026 --> 01:44:34,223
"This feather might look worthless...

1730
01:44:35,566 --> 01:44:37,523
"...butit comes from afar...

1731
01:44:37,816 --> 01:44:40,979
"...and carries with it, all my good intentions."

1732
01:44:42,396 --> 01:44:44,069
And so the woman waited...

1733
01:44:44,686 --> 01:44:46,859
...year after year...

1734
01:44:47,186 --> 01:44:49,564
...until she could tell her daughter this...

1735
01:44:50,726 --> 01:44:54,321
...in perfect American English.

1736
01:44:57,526 --> 01:44:59,392
[applause]

1737
01:45:10,436 --> 01:45:13,064
Hello, may I please speak to
Gareth Donahue, please?

1738
01:45:14,186 --> 01:45:16,359
Oh, excellent. Great, how are you?

1739
01:45:16,776 --> 01:45:18,221
Good, uh, good.

1740
01:45:18,226 --> 01:45:22,481
My name is Courtney and I'm calling
from the Australian Screen Fund.

1741
01:45:23,646 --> 01:45:26,399
Yeah, yeah, I just have a
couple of questions to ask you.

1742
01:45:27,856 --> 01:45:29,642
L haven't submitted anything yet.

1743
01:45:29,816 --> 01:45:32,057
[COURTNEY] Uhm, they're
just preliminary questions.

1744
01:45:32,066 --> 01:45:34,182
Uh, yep, sure. Go ahead.

1745
01:45:35,186 --> 01:45:37,439
Okay, great! Um, question one...

1746
01:45:38,646 --> 01:45:40,273
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1747
01:45:40,776 --> 01:45:43,928
Reuben, you little shit!
Don't you dare call here again!

1748
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:46,519
- Is something wrong, Gareth?
- Shut up, Lillian!

1749
01:45:46,526 --> 01:45:47,527
[phone rings]

1750
01:45:49,396 --> 01:45:50,397
What?

1751
01:45:50,476 --> 01:45:53,571
Gareth, do you even understand how much
bad karma you're bringing on yourself?

1752
01:45:54,026 --> 01:45:55,892
Rubes, you know I don't believe in that crap.

1753
01:45:56,146 --> 01:45:58,729
No, you wouldn't believe in that,
'cause you don't believe in yourself, either.

1754
01:45:59,066 --> 01:46:01,717
You just take other people's ideas, as your own...

1755
01:46:01,726 --> 01:46:04,320
...and give them no credit for it
-- or reward for their hard work.

1756
01:46:04,526 --> 01:46:09,350
You just smudge intricate
details into some bland cliché,
devoid of any authenticity or sincerity...

1757
01:46:09,356 --> 01:46:12,144
...and all in the name of grubby
money and unregulated power!

1758
01:46:12,316 --> 01:46:13,317
Oh.

1759
01:46:13,566 --> 01:46:15,933
Oh, okay, what are you gonna do about it? Huh?

1760
01:46:16,186 --> 01:46:18,553
Gotothe papers? Start a smear campaign?

1761
01:46:18,566 --> 01:46:22,525
L will take you down for defamation so hard,
you will leave a crater in the pavement!

1762
01:46:22,646 --> 01:46:26,344
You think I would give you
that kind of satisfaction by
naming names and giving you that kind of notoriety?

1763
01:46:26,356 --> 01:46:27,687
What do ya want, Rubes?

1764
01:46:27,976 --> 01:46:29,683
An apology? Huh?

1765
01:46:29,856 --> 01:46:30,891
You're not gonna get one.

1766
01:46:30,896 --> 01:46:33,558
Oh, I know, some uninterrupted time to tell me off!

1767
01:46:33,566 --> 01:46:34,852
Well, I'm not listening!

1768
01:46:34,856 --> 01:46:38,099
You said yourself I can bombard you over
the pheone like nobody else can!

1769
01:46:38,106 --> 01:46:40,461
L can talk over you like a radio signal!

1770
01:46:40,476 --> 01:46:42,308
No! You can pull the wool cver my eyes...

1771
01:46:42,316 --> 01:46:44,887
<i>...and you can fool other people inte
following your leadership with your...</i>

1772
01:46:44,896 --> 01:46:46,466
...slick sales pitch and big promises --

1773
01:46:46,476 --> 01:46:50,640
I can just keep geing forever if you want, Ruby.
It doesn't really matter, 'cause
I'm not gonna be listening.

1774
01:46:50,646 --> 01:46:52,307
Ha! Keep talkin', buddy.

1775
01:46:52,316 --> 01:46:57,220
-- And you can take my story and you can change
the names and the genders and
the careers and the motivations...

1776
01:46:57,226 --> 01:47:00,059
. and you can give my character
an accent or a lisp or...

1777
01:47:00,066 --> 01:47:02,091
...a-a-an enlarged tongue, or no tongue or...

1778
01:47:02,106 --> 01:47:05,633
...false teeth or no speech skills at
all, but you can't silence me, Gareth!

1779
01:47:05,646 --> 01:47:09,219
Or my truth about what a horrible,
vicious shake in the grass you are!

1780
01:47:09,226 --> 01:47:10,227
[clears throat]

1781
01:47:22,316 --> 01:47:24,717
You've been listening to my
private phone conversations!

1782
01:47:24,726 --> 01:47:27,013
L somehow feel strangely invelved!

1783
01:47:27,026 --> 01:47:28,642
Oh and I suppose you agree with him?

1784
01:47:28,646 --> 01:47:30,808
Every incredulous word!

1785
01:47:30,816 --> 01:47:33,763
Look at yourself, Gareth!
You're turning into a menster!

1786
01:47:33,776 --> 01:47:35,096
Aw, are you scared of me, Lily?

1787
01:47:35,106 --> 01:47:37,211
Uh, of you? Christ no!

1788
01:47:37,226 --> 01:47:40,059
I'm scared of whatever it is that
makes me support you...

1789
01:47:40,066 --> 01:47:41,761
...and your nasty little secrets!

1790
01:47:41,776 --> 01:47:44,928
Those nasty little secrets bought
this house and everything in it!

1791
01:47:44,936 --> 01:47:47,530
Well, I despise this house
and I loathe everything in it!

1792
01:47:47,606 --> 01:47:48,721
There's the door.

1793
01:47:49,896 --> 01:47:53,685
How am I supposed to enjoy the tainted
reward for the suffering of other pecple?

1794
01:47:53,816 --> 01:47:56,854
You really expect me to share
in the spoils of your delusions?

1795
01:47:56,976 --> 01:47:58,728
It's never bothered you before!

1796
01:47:59,066 --> 01:48:02,172
Well, it's always bothered me and maybe
if you paid a little bit more attention...

1797
01:48:02,186 --> 01:48:03,768
...you might understand that!

1798
01:48:03,776 --> 01:48:04,777
I don't need this shit.

1799
01:48:07,026 --> 01:48:08,016
[phone rings]

1800
01:48:08,026 --> 01:48:11,280
I tell you, if that's Reuben... I'm
gonna throttle the little prick.

1801
01:48:11,526 --> 01:48:12,527
Ooh.

1802
01:48:13,356 --> 01:48:14,357
[phone rings]

1803
01:48:18,026 --> 01:48:19,858
Hey! Shelley!

1804
01:48:20,276 --> 01:48:21,562
How are you, beautiful?

1805
01:48:22,896 --> 01:48:23,897
You did?

1806
01:48:24,066 --> 01:48:25,067
Who'd you get?

1807
01:48:25,566 --> 01:48:27,318
Ch, I love her!

1808
01:48:27,566 --> 01:48:29,398
That's box office, right there!

1809
01:48:31,186 --> 01:48:32,859
2 [groovy music] &

1810
01:48:42,186 --> 01:48:44,143
[general chatter]

1811
01:48:56,026 --> 01:48:58,176
Hey, Reuben! I'm glad you could make it.

1812
01:48:58,186 --> 01:48:59,768
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss it for the world.

1813
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:01,517
I'm so excited to see Myles propose!

1814
01:49:01,526 --> 01:49:03,392
I know, it's very exciting.

1815
01:49:04,276 --> 01:49:05,607
You know, I've realized something.

1816
01:49:06,396 --> 01:49:07,727
You're a little runt.

1817
01:49:07,896 --> 01:49:08,897
Pardon me?

1818
01:49:09,606 --> 01:49:11,631
Do you remember when Derek first introduced us?

1819
01:49:11,646 --> 01:49:14,764
And ... Itold you the story
about when he was little and...

1820
01:49:14,776 --> 01:49:19,771
<i>...him wanting a puppy and
how I had to explain to him
that the littlest and weakest
one was the most special?</i>

1821
01:49:20,896 --> 01:49:22,898
So, I'm the weak little outcast, am I?

1822
01:49:23,106 --> 01:49:28,101
No, you are the one chosen by nature
to face the toughest of obstacles.

1823
01:49:28,316 --> 01:49:31,525
And with that, you gain the
most strength and support.

1824
01:49:31,856 --> 01:49:34,029
Well, thank you, Faye. I'm really feeling it now.

1825
01:49:34,276 --> 01:49:35,641
Maybe this will help;

1826
01:49:41,026 --> 01:49:42,642
It may seem worthless...

1827
01:49:42,936 --> 01:49:44,859
...butit comes from my heart...

1828
01:49:45,146 --> 01:49:47,729
...and it carries with it, the best of intentions.

1829
01:49:50,316 --> 01:49:51,386
How can you afford this?

1830
01:49:51,396 --> 01:49:55,321
Ch! Worst case scenario,
I'll just have to use crayons instead of paints.

1831
01:49:55,726 --> 01:49:57,603
It's a balanced risk I'm willing to take.

1832
01:49:58,436 --> 01:49:59,779
- Thank you.
- Gimme a hug.

1833
01:50:03,476 --> 01:50:06,650
So, when she gets here, are we all
going to hide and surprise her?

1834
01:50:06,976 --> 01:50:07,966
No, Mum.

1835
01:50:07,976 --> 01:50:11,935
You just... wait for her to walk in and
I'll kneel down on one knee and propose.

1836
01:50:12,106 --> 01:50:13,107
Simple as that.

1837
01:50:13,976 --> 01:50:15,728
There's charm in simplicity.

1838
01:50:26,146 --> 01:50:27,147
What's geing on?

1839
01:50:27,566 --> 01:50:30,228
Quiet everybody, Myles is
going to propose to her now!

[gasping]

1841
01:50:43,276 --> 01:50:44,277
Um...

1842
01:50:45,026 --> 01:50:46,027
Yeah.

1843
01:50:47,026 --> 01:50:48,027
What he said...

1844
01:50:49,606 --> 01:50:50,607
Will you?

1845
01:50:52,436 --> 01:50:53,437
[thudding on counter-top]

1846
01:50:56,316 --> 01:50:57,317
What?

1847
01:50:58,436 --> 01:50:59,437
Would...

1848
01:51:01,226 --> 01:51:03,024
Okay, goon... Ask me.

1849
01:51:05,356 --> 01:51:06,687
Courtney Shanahan...

1850
01:51:07,936 --> 01:51:09,313
...will you marry me?

1851
01:51:11,856 --> 01:51:16,930
I've... been waiting... for this
moment since I was a little girl...

1852
01:51:21,566 --> 01:51:22,681
Yes, of course!

1853
01:51:22,686 --> 01:51:24,222
Of course I'll marry you!

1854
01:51:25,356 --> 01:51:26,357
[awkward clapping]

1855
01:51:29,976 --> 01:51:32,308
Reuben, do you even
comprehend what you've done?

1856
01:51:32,316 --> 01:51:34,933
Oh, lock Faye, just leave me the fuck alone, will ya?

1857
01:51:35,026 --> 01:51:36,471
L feel bad encugh already!

1858
01:51:37,816 --> 01:51:39,682
That's it, just fuck off, you stupid bitch!

1859
01:51:40,566 --> 01:51:42,227
He told your mother to fuck off.

1860
01:51:43,726 --> 01:51:44,727
No!

1861
01:51:45,226 --> 01:51:47,979
You fuck off!

1862
01:51:48,436 --> 01:51:50,029
[shocked murmurs]

1863
01:52:33,646 --> 01:52:37,401
<i>And Reuben, you can consider
that cheque null and void!</i>

1864
01:52:47,066 --> 01:52:48,067
Reuben!

1865
01:52:48,226 --> 01:52:52,481

01:54:37,276 --> 01:54:38,277

1899
01:55:45,226 --> 01:55:46,352
[Reuben sobs]

1900
01:55:46,976 --> 01:55:48,853
J [ethereal music] &

1901
01:55:54,566 --> 01:55:56,068
[soft chatter]

1902
01:56:02,476 --> 01:56:04,103
You really have some nerve.

1903
01:56:04,356 --> 01:56:08,475
How am I supposed to go on sighing now,
when every gesture reminds me of Derek?

1904
01:56:09,026 --> 01:56:15,227
And after all he did for you
and your speech impediment
and you're prepared to just wash
your hands of him? Literally?

1905
01:56:15,856 --> 01:56:19,531
I 'have lost the only person
who ever loved me for me.

1906
01:56:20,686 --> 01:56:22,188
That's not my preblem.

1907
01:56:24,066 --> 01:56:26,091
You really should have let me
put my screenplay in with him.

1908
01:56:26,106 --> 01:56:27,642
It could have been cremated too, then.

1909
01:56:27,816 --> 01:56:30,057
And you're thinking about your screenplay now?

1910
01:56:30,066 --> 01:56:31,318
Of course I am.

1911
01:56:32,646 --> 01:56:37,277
That screenplay was the manifestation
of my love for Derek and the gift that he gave me.

1912
01:56:37,856 --> 01:56:40,188
Without it, I've got no semblance of him.

1913
01:56:40,726 --> 01:56:42,023
So, you tell me, Faye...

1914
01:56:54,726 --> 01:56:56,569
That's what he would have wanted.

1915
01:57:03,686 --> 01:57:07,475
[GARETH] Shelley, I swear, the funding is coming,
we've just to put it in the next round.

1916
01:57:08,276 --> 01:57:13,521
No, I know. I-l know I said
we'd have the funding by now,
but I can't be responsible
for what the funding bod --

1917
01:57:13,776 --> 01:57:14,766
Oh, wh --

1918
01:57:14,776 --> 01:57:16,028
Hey, hey, don't take that tone.

1919
01:57:16,106 --> 01:57:17,528
I'm deing this for you, okay?

1920
01:57:17,646 --> 01:57:20,069
The least I expect, is that you show me the s --

1921
01:57:20,976 --> 01:57:23,729
Well, cancel the tour! We've got a movie to make!

1922
01:57:24,526 --> 01:57:25,425
No...

1923
01:57:25,436 --> 01:57:29,714
Shelley, hey, baby, this role is perfect for you.

1924
01:57:29,726 --> 01:57:33,185
That's why I want you, and only you, lead the film.

1925
01:57:36,186 --> 01:57:37,187
Please!

1926
01:57:37,776 --> 01:57:38,777
Shelley...

1927
01:57:39,606 --> 01:57:42,632
Don't give up oh me. Okay,
look, look. Just let me level --

1928
01:57:42,646 --> 01:57:44,899
Yes! I need you, the funding --

1929
01:57:45,356 --> 01:57:47,643
What do you mean I'm all talk? How dare you?

1930
01:57:48,976 --> 01:57:49,977
Oh!

1931
01:57:50,186 --> 01:57:52,143
Oh, what? So you're quitting?

1932
01:57:52,476 --> 01:57:55,070
Uh, well, you just remember
who my legal rep is, okay?

1933
01:57:55,606 --> 01:57:58,428
Oh yeah? Well, we'll see about
that! Look, Shelley, shut up!

1934
01:57:58,436 --> 01:58:00,052
L can't deal with you, right now!

1935
01:58:00,066 --> 01:58:02,307
And you'd better be ready for the legal ramific --

1936
01:58:02,316 --> 01:58:03,317
Shelley!

1937
01:58:14,936 --> 01:58:15,937
L know, right?

1938
01:58:18,936 --> 01:58:23,396
Gareth, you're just going to have to give up
on that film. Just drop it, okay?

1939
01:58:23,606 --> 01:58:24,778
No, Lily.

1940
01:58:26,106 --> 01:58:29,474
I'll just find another star. I've got connections.
I can make it work!

1941
01:58:34,276 --> 01:58:35,641
L own it.

1942
01:58:35,646 --> 01:58:37,341
I can do what I want with it.

1943
01:58:37,356 --> 01:58:39,632
And thanks to you, it's legal and binding.

1944
01:58:39,646 --> 01:58:43,025
Hm, thanks to me, you're geing straight to Hell.

1945
01:58:43,226 --> 01:58:44,682
What on Earth are you talking about?

1946
01:58:46,436 --> 01:58:47,562
What the fuck's this?

1947
01:58:48,896 --> 01:58:53,311
Remember Reuben? The stuttering
playwright we slapped in the face?

1948
01:58:54,146 --> 01:58:56,513
Well, his deaf boyfriend died last month.

1949
01:58:56,526 --> 01:59:00,724
And Reuben's pouring his heart out
in a stage play in honour of his memory.

1950
01:59:01,186 --> 01:59:03,644
Well, I'm not respensible for that!

1951
01:59:04,026 --> 01:59:08,224
You'd better have a look at this play.
If he's using anything from "Burden”, we'll sue him!

1952
01:59:09,106 --> 01:59:14,761
You stole that man's baby!
The same way you begrudge me of mine!

1953
01:59:14,776 --> 01:59:15,891
Oh, for crying out loud!

1954
01:59:16,526 --> 01:59:19,632
He gave it to you to surrogate
and nurture and bring to term!

1955
01:59:19,646 --> 01:59:22,468
And you just snatched it away
and now, because of me...

1956
01:59:22,476 --> 01:59:25,264
...there's been an enormous miscarriage of justice!

1957
01:59:25,276 --> 01:59:26,687
Well, no more!

1958
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:28,148
No more what?

1959
01:59:28,276 --> 01:59:31,962
I'm sick of your nonsense, Gareth!
I'm geing to give Reuben his film back.

1960
01:59:31,976 --> 01:59:33,853
You will do no such thing, Lily!

1961
01:59:33,976 --> 01:59:36,809
Gareth! You are a lowly, despicable dog!

1962
01:59:36,816 --> 01:59:40,423
You have the gall to insult that man's integrity
and his commitment to his work...

1963
01:59:40,436 --> 01:59:42,552
...even when he's suffered such a significant loss?

1964
01:59:42,566 --> 01:59:44,182
Lily, you're getting a bit upset.

1965
01:59:44,356 --> 01:59:45,676
You're a bully!

1966
01:59:45,686 --> 01:59:48,633
You're a coward, you're a thief
and you're a -- argh, a bully!

1967
01:59:48,646 --> 01:59:50,171
I've done nothing illegal!

1968
01:59:50,186 --> 01:59:52,598
You've done nothing ethical, or even fair!

1969
01:59:52,606 --> 01:59:55,348
- Oh, apparently, I stole someone's baby!
- From me!

1970
01:59:55,356 --> 01:59:59,463
You stole my chance at
having children! And now this!

1971
01:59:59,476 --> 02:00:01,717
Reuben's created this script cut of nothing!

1972
02:00:01,726 --> 02:00:06,311
He crafted it out of complete
belief in himself and the whole time...

1973
02:00:06,316 --> 02:00:09,980
...you've just been sitting there like a spider,
waiting to devour it!

1974
02:00:10,226 --> 02:00:12,092
You know that film belongs to Reuben.

1975
02:00:12,106 --> 02:00:15,428
And you can't just run off with somecne's
life force and say it's your own!

1976
02:00:15,436 --> 02:00:16,597
I don't have to listen to this shit!

1977
02:00:16,606 --> 02:00:18,802
Oh, yes you do!

1978
02:00:18,816 --> 02:00:19,806
And you will!

1979
02:00:19,816 --> 02:00:22,217
You are absolutely, batshit mad! Do you know that?

1980
02:00:22,226 --> 02:00:25,389
When we got married, I wanted to have children.

1981
02:00:25,396 --> 02:00:28,093
You said wait. So, I did!

1982
02:00:28,106 --> 02:00:31,861
L waited years for you to build
your career and I built mine.

1983
02:00:32,316 --> 02:00:35,308
Waiting patiently for you to say it was the right time!

1984
02:00:35,316 --> 02:00:38,923
L stamped and signed over
all your dirty, rotten deals.

1985
02:00:38,936 --> 02:00:43,521
I 'hung off your arm at every pompous,
self-indulgent awards ceremony.

1986
02:00:43,526 --> 02:00:44,516
But you...!

1987
02:00:44,526 --> 02:00:47,939
You just take all the energy and take over and...

1988
02:00:48,816 --> 02:00:52,559
You are the cancer to the
fulfillment of decent people!

1989
02:00:52,566 --> 02:00:54,967
Well, fuck me drunk!
Didn't you marry poorly!

1990
02:00:54,976 --> 02:00:57,479
You conned us both out of cur chance at happiness!

1991
02:00:57,816 --> 02:01:00,422
Those two were in love!

1992
02:01:00,436 --> 02:01:02,962
- It's not ab--
- The same way we were in love!

1993
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:04,478
It's not about love!

1994
02:01:04,646 --> 02:01:06,466
It's about doing it the correct way.

1995
02:01:06,476 --> 02:01:08,467
Oh, and I suppose your way is the correct way?

1996
02:01:08,476 --> 02:01:09,477
Exactly!

1997
02:01:10,976 --> 02:01:14,105
You're really going to claim expertise on this?

1998
02:01:14,936 --> 02:01:15,937
Yes!

1999
02:01:17,226 --> 02:01:20,423
You're going to hijack Reuben's story;

2000
02:01:20,436 --> 02:01:24,930
The autobiography of a gay playwright,
with a stutter, who learns to sign...

2001
02:01:24,936 --> 02:01:31,603
...only to lose his deaf boyfriend 50 years
too soon -- and somehow -- you're geing to have...

2002
02:01:31,646 --> 02:01:33,808
...superior knowledge on the subject, over him?

2003
02:01:33,816 --> 02:01:37,400
<i>Weren't we talking about
parenthood a moment ago? Huh?</i>

2004
02:01:37,566 --> 02:01:41,264
For Christ's sake, Lily! Pick
a complaint and stick with it!

2005
02:01:41,276 --> 02:01:43,222
L 'am not responsible for your happiness!

2006
02:01:43,226 --> 02:01:46,139
You are solely responsible for my unhappiness!

2007
02:01:46,146 --> 02:01:47,591
All right, now you're being pathetic.

2008
02:01:47,606 --> 02:01:48,846
You're pathetic!

2009
02:01:48,856 --> 02:01:49,857
Oh!

2010
02:01:50,026 --> 02:01:51,357
What are you gonna do, huh?

2011
02:01:51,936 --> 02:01:53,279
You're gonna ruin me?

2012
02:01:53,356 --> 02:01:54,357
Divorce me?

2013
02:01:54,816 --> 02:01:57,183
What will you have then? Huh?

2014
02:01:57,436 --> 02:02:01,031
No children. Not even a potential father for them.

2015
02:02:01,316 --> 02:02:05,651
Exactly, so tell me what I have to lose!

2016
02:02:06,396 --> 02:02:07,397
Me!

2017
02:02:07,976 --> 02:02:09,762
Lillian, you lose me!

2018
02:02:09,776 --> 02:02:12,677
Aw, well, good fucking riddens!

2019
02:02:12,686 --> 02:02:18,102
No wonder we can't conceive a child.
You're incapable of conceiving an original idea!

2020
02:02:19,316 --> 02:02:20,636
Where are you going?

2021
02:02:20,646 --> 02:02:21,852
Get back here!

2022
02:02:21,976 --> 02:02:25,856
I'm going to restore hope back to
the life of a fellow human being!

2023
02:02:25,896 --> 02:02:28,319
Something you wouldn't understand!

2024
02:02:30,816 --> 02:02:33,023
You can't save the world, Lillian!

2025
02:02:33,436 --> 02:02:37,191
Ng, but I can save one man's last semblance of his!

2026
02:02:38,526 --> 02:02:40,472
Those contracts still stand!

2027
02:02:40,476 --> 02:02:42,729
Aw, yeah? Well, sue me!

2028
02:02:44,896 --> 02:02:45,897
Goddamn it!

2029
02:02:54,396 --> 02:02:55,397
Fuck!

2030
02:02:58,106 --> 02:03:00,188
J [peaceful acoustic music] &

2031
02:03:28,396 --> 02:03:30,069
Private rehearsal, sorry!

2032
02:03:33,726 --> 02:03:35,069
What do you want?

2033
02:03:37,276 --> 02:03:39,529
I... just want to extend...

2034
02:03:39,856 --> 02:03:42,143
...my deepest sympathies..

2035
02:03:43,186 --> 02:03:44,972
...and most sincere regrets.

2036
02:03:46,356 --> 02:03:47,357
Thanks.

2037
02:03:51,146 --> 02:03:52,432
So, how are you?

2038
02:03:53,856 --> 02:03:55,051
Devastated!

2039
02:03:55,066 --> 02:03:56,067
Thank you!

2040
02:03:57,526 --> 02:03:59,472
I've been thinking a lot about Gareth.

2041
02:04:00,316 --> 02:04:02,648
And how he's rewriting your script...

2042
02:04:02,776 --> 02:04:04,926
...to fit Shelley and Peterin...

2043
02:04:04,936 --> 02:04:10,318
...which would give no reason to credit
or compensate you, for your contribution.

2044
02:04:11,316 --> 02:04:13,592
I've had on my mind a lot lately, myself.

2045
02:04:13,606 --> 02:04:15,461
Well, you know you can do the same to him, right?

2046
02:04:15,476 --> 02:04:16,477
What?

2047
02:04:16,896 --> 02:04:20,526
Even without changing the premise.
You can't copyright history.

2048
02:04:22,726 --> 02:04:24,728
What about... intellectual property?

2049
02:04:26,316 --> 02:04:27,465
It's your story.

2050
02:04:27,476 --> 02:04:30,355
Gareth might own... an account toit...

2051
02:04:31,276 --> 02:04:35,031
You, meanwhile, have the actual
memory and experience.

2052
02:04:35,436 --> 02:04:39,521
Change the names, rearrange the plot and
you've got yourself a whole new "Burden”.

2053
02:04:41,226 --> 02:04:42,227
I'll say.

2054
02:04:44,646 --> 02:04:48,230
Well, unlike Gareth, I've actually read
"The Burden of Being Me".

2055
02:04:49,776 --> 02:04:51,437
You're a very talented writer.

2056
02:04:51,856 --> 02:04:55,440
Who clearly has vivid insight into what he loves.

2057
02:04:56,566 --> 02:04:57,567
L did have...

2058
02:04:58,146 --> 02:04:59,147
. until he stole it.

2059
02:04:59,566 --> 02:05:03,560
Just because Gareth owns the
title and the deeds to that story...

2060
02:05:03,566 --> 02:05:06,172
...doesn't mean he has a claim to the...

2061
02:05:06,186 --> 02:05:08,860
...title of the film or deeds therein.

2062
02:05:08,936 --> 02:05:10,188
Don't you see?

2063
02:05:10,566 --> 02:05:13,649
If someone wanted to create a reality TV show on...

2064
02:05:14,066 --> 02:05:16,023
...celebrities wanting to beat each other up.

2065
02:05:16,606 --> 02:05:19,189
They could have just as easily
have called it "Star Wars".

2066
02:05:20,686 --> 02:05:21,687
Um...

2067
02:05:22,146 --> 02:05:24,569
I'm pretty sure that would
be legal action, right there.

2068
02:05:25,816 --> 02:05:28,569
There's always loopholes. Trust me.

2069
02:05:32,356 --> 02:05:34,188
Derek once said, um...

2070
02:05:35,026 --> 02:05:36,528
"Love all but...

2071
02:05:37,896 --> 02:05:39,227
...trust few."

2072
02:05:42,396 --> 02:05:44,979
I'm pretty sure that was Shakespeare.

2073
02:05:46,856 --> 02:05:48,062
What would I know?

2074
02:05:48,396 --> 02:05:49,818
I'm just - just a thespian.

2075
02:06:00,226 --> 02:06:02,979
Do you mind if I just watch you rehearse?

2076
02:06:08,476 --> 02:06:09,477
Okay.

2077
02:06:15,776 --> 02:06:18,552
Peter, I know I'm not very
good at finger-spelling, but...

2078
02:06:18,566 --> 02:06:20,978
...I'm-1'mtrying my best, so cut me some slack.

2079
02:06:21,146 --> 02:06:22,602
Um... go - go ahead.

2080
02:06:27,186 --> 02:06:28,893
Peter, please don't quit.

2081
02:06:29,396 --> 02:06:30,397
Go ahead.

2082
02:06:36,526 --> 02:06:37,891
Stopped keying? What - what?

2083
02:06:38,226 --> 02:06:40,854
St-stop -- operator, wh-what does it -- ?

2084
02:06:43,436 --> 02:06:44,813
Oh, he... he hung up?

2085
02:06:47,226 --> 02:06:48,512
Uh, thanks... Um...

2086
02:06:48,526 --> 02:06:49,812
Oh, yeah, uh...

2087
02:06:49,976 --> 02:06:51,182
Stop keying.

2088
02:06:51,896 --> 02:06:52,897
Go ahead.

I've got something for you...

2094
02:07:43,476 --> 02:07:46,320
Just that I thought that I'd
invest in my son's legacy.

2095
02:07:47,686 --> 02:07:49,108
The runt puppy that...

2096
02:07:49,396 --> 02:07:51,148
...turned into a swan.

2097
02:07:51,606 --> 02:07:55,065
A creature that was more than
anybody could ever hope for.

2109
02:08:56,356 --> 02:08:58,188
Thank you all for coming tonight.

2110
02:08:58,776 --> 02:09:01,768
Now that you've seen my feature film,
"The Purpose of Being Me"

2111
02:09:01,776 --> 02:09:04,689
You'll see why I need to thank some
people in the audience tonight.

2112
02:09:05,186 --> 02:09:08,269
Not - n-not just those who... uh... supported and...

2113
02:09:08,276 --> 02:09:12,645
...loved me throughout the whole ordeal, but those
who were challenging and bullying me throughout it.

2114
02:09:13,146 --> 02:09:14,966
'Cause it's thanks to you that I had to...

2115
02:09:14,976 --> 02:09:16,933
...strive for excellence. To...

2116
02:09:17,106 --> 02:09:18,858
...overcome and prove you wrong.

2117
02:09:19,276 --> 02:09:22,928
And I would hope that this film will help
others to pursue their creative endeavours...

2118
02:09:22,936 --> 02:09:24,279
...in whatever form they may take.

2119
02:09:25,816 --> 02:09:29,343
Even thought the words I have to say
might have trouble getting out sometimes,

2120
02:09:29,356 --> 02:09:32,394
what l... want to say should
not be lost in translation.

2121
02:09:33,566 --> 02:09:36,354
Because actions speak louder than words.
