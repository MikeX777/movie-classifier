00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,390
Hi, everyone, my name is Hong An.

3
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,365
I am eight years old.

4
00:00:34,365 --> 00:00:40,007
Like any other child, I'm being taken to "school" every morning by my dad.

5
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:44,099
Concentrate on your driving! What are you looking at?

6
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:46,782
- Mom.
 - What?
 - Everyone stops at traffic lights.

7
00:00:46,782 --> 00:00:48,432
Why isn't he looking at the traffic light but at me?

8
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:50,165
We are in the car lane.

9
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:52,140
Oh, is this the car lane?

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,000
I've never driven a car. How would I know?

11
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,949
To be honest, I don't have a dad.

12
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:01,715
This is my mom.

13
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:04,057
I consider her to be my dad.

14
00:01:04,057 --> 00:01:06,674
That's right. My mom is quite strict,

15
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:09,316
but she really loves me.

16
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:14,015
Mom, I told you before. We need to fill up the motorbike with gasoline. Why are you so forgetful?

17
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:16,607
Stop nagging! Everyone makes mistakes.

18
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:20,674
But you always make mistakes, Mom. You're raising me all wrong!

19
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:23,507
This is my biggest dream.

20
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:26,032
As you know, I go to "school" everyday.

21
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:29,607
But not for studying... I go there to buy banh mi*.
 (*Vietnamese bread)

22
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:30,882
- Mom.
 - What?

23
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,432
When can I go to school?

24
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:35,324
You're only eight years old! You don't need to go to school. When you're nine, you can go.

25
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:38,507
But all of my friends have gone to school since they were six years old.

26
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:40,007
Why do children nowadays start going to school so early?

27
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:43,420
I didn't go to school until I was about fourteen or fifteen years old.

28
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:46,850
Mom!

29
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:49,975
D*mn...

30
00:01:52,158 --> 00:01:53,932
I am sorry.

31
00:01:53,932 --> 00:01:58,449
Shame on you! How dare you hit her car?

32
00:01:58,449 --> 00:02:01,541
Maybe you don't know who she is, right?

33
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:09,490
[Accidentally Dad]

34
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,965
Since you are sick like this, don't call me, okay?

35
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:18,190
I-If you die, don't even look for me!
 - Stop!

36
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:19,974
- Run after your dad!
 - Remember, don't call me!

37
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:23,066
Daddy, be careful. Don't fall!

38
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:26,440
He fell, but he's all right.

39
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:28,265
Keep enjoying your coffee.

40
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:30,858
Continue enjoying your coffee, okay?

41
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,183
- Mom!
 - What is it?

42
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:37,466
He left.

43
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:42,240
Oh my gosh! I almost coughed up my throat.

44
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,210
Mom, was it ketchup or chilly sauce?

45
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,060
I mixed them together.

46
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:48,465
That's gross!

47
00:02:48,465 --> 00:02:50,107
What are we celebrating?

48
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:52,599
Let me think about it. Great acting!

49
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,690
Let's get fried chicken across the street.

50
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:57,160
Okay, make sure to remove the skin for me.

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,558
Oh my, she's on a diet!

52
00:02:59,558 --> 00:03:02,632
To be honest, she didn't want to be this way,

53
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:05,424
but she needs money for her business.

54
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:09,482
As you know, though, doing business has its ups and downs.

55
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:14,166
In case of a down, I don't get to eat fried chicken.

56
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:17,241
- Is it tasty?
 - What are you doing?

57
00:03:17,241 --> 00:03:19,374
We don't even have food to eat, yet you're feeding the dog?

58
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:22,757
I pitied Mun. She hasn't eaten all day!

59
00:03:22,757 --> 00:03:24,549
What about me?

60
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:26,291
You eat this.

61
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,290
Here, this is for you.

62
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,092
- You eat it.
 - What about you?

63
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:32,899
- I'll eat "Mun's meat."
 - No!

64
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,440
Mun, you have to go down.

65
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:38,490
- Let's eat so we can go to work this evening.
 - I'm going to eat.

66
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,050
Yes.

67
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,899
The way of living is like this.

68
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:47,582
We eat when we are hungry and laugh when we are happy. It's a shame we don't have a dad.

69
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:51,608
If we did, we would be so happy.

70
00:03:52,883 --> 00:03:56,316
[Five, ten, fifteen... forty]

71
00:03:56,316 --> 00:04:00,024
If we get another great "deal" like this, we will be awesome tomorrow.

72
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:01,732
- As usual?
 - Yes.

73
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:05,308
Let's go big this time and make their jaws drop!

74
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,024
- Okay. All right.
 - N-Not yet!

75
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:14,608
- Be careful, do you hear?
 - Okay.

76
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:19,425
- Mommy!
 - Oh my God! My baby!

77
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,815
Roll back.

78
00:04:20,816 --> 00:04:22,750
Oh, Lord, help me, please!

79
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,720
- He hit my child.
 - Help me!

80
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,316
Are you all right?

81
00:04:27,316 --> 00:04:29,565
Maybe my ribs are broken!

82
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:33,257
Lord, I have no money to take her to the hospital. This could cost â‚«5,000,000!

83
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:34,590
Oh my God!

84
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,990
Hey! H-Hey!

85
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,207
- What are you doing?
 - Come here. What are you doing?

86
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:41,674
- Are you asking me what I'm doing?
 - You hit a person, and now you want to run? What are you up to?

87
00:04:41,674 --> 00:04:44,075
- Where did you get hurt, Baby?
 - Mom, my lungs are probably damaged.

88
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,766
Damaged lungs?

89
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:47,715
Gosh, that would cost â‚«10,000,000!

90
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:49,632
Give me fifteen and a half million dong. I'll take her to the hospital.

91
00:04:49,632 --> 00:04:52,865
- How the h*ll is it â‚«500,000 extra?
 - It's for the taxi! Do you think the taxi is free?

92
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:55,507
- Are you going to give me the money?
 - It hurts!

93
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:58,082
Everybody, come and see this!

94
00:04:58,082 --> 00:05:00,307
You, stop screaming!

95
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:02,308
Here, take this!

96
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:05,874
- How much are you compensating?
 - Only this much for you and your daughter... Take it or leave it!

97
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:07,865
- You don't care about her life!
 - What else do you want?

98
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:10,665
- What do you want? Will you give me the money or not?
 - You...
 - I'm in so much pain!

99
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:13,083
- What compensation?
 - Run if you can! What's your plate number?

100
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,582
- Six, seven, eight... God of Fortune!*
 - What are you doing?
 (Asians like to pray to this god for more money.)

101
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,674
- I dare you to run!
 - H-Hey!

102
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:20,365
You hit my daughter and now you want to leave?

103
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:23,150
Go ahead and hit me as well.

104
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,041
- I want to die!
 - It hurts!

105
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,491
I'm so worthless!

106
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:34,800
Mom, my hand is broken too.

107
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:42,107
Where is she? Where is my daughter?

108
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,024
Are you planning to kidnap her? Are you a kidnapper too, now?

109
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:46,925
Go away. Get away. Hey...

110
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,275
What are you doing? Where are we going?

111
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:54,315
I'm taking the two of you to withdraw money, all right?

112
00:05:54,316 --> 00:06:00,516
All right, but make sure it's â‚«15,500,000, or I won't get out of the car.

113
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:05,408
Hey, why don't you take us to the bank to get money? Why are you bringing us to the hospital?

114
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:06,808
Oh my God. My heavens!

115
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:09,558
Hey, do you hear me?

116
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:15,116
Hey, you, put her down! Put my daughter down!

117
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:17,024
- Child, lie still, okay?
 - What are you doing?

118
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:19,132
Hey, what are you doing?

119
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:21,340
Are you going to give us the money or not? Give money to my child!

120
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,932
- What are you doing? Keep silent!
 - Why did you bring us here?

121
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:26,049
Everyone, come and see! He hit my daughter and now he wants to run.

122
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:28,141
- Give me the money!
 - Stop screaming.

123
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:29,866
Stop, your *ss.

124
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:31,774
Give me the money. Give it!

125
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:33,274
Give me the money right now!

126
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:36,775
Security! Security, take him!

127
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:39,875
Arrest him, not me!

128
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:42,799
- Lady, be calm, all right?
 - Give me the money!

129
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:45,500
Be quiet. Keep her still.

130
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:48,907
Are you going to give me the money or not?

131
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:50,515
Why did you bring my child here?

132
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:52,675
Are you going to be quiet?

133
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:56,533
- How is she, Nurse?
 - She's fine, no serious injuries.

134
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:59,190
Hey, why the h*ll do you answer him? He's not a doctor.

135
00:06:59,191 --> 00:07:00,991
I am her mom. She was seriously injured.

136
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:03,508
This is Doctor Tung Son.

137
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,333
- Son Tung* what?
 - Doctor Tung Son.
 (*singer)

138
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,258
He is the head of this hospital's emergency department.

139
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:19,225
There shouldn't be a problem now.

140
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:22,400
- Everyone, go back to work.
  - All right.

141
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:25,525
You, too.

142
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:33,540
It hurts! I'm hurting!

143
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,415
I'm hurt. It hurts.

144
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,650
Hey, Sweetie, where does it hurt?

145
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,257
Tell me.

146
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:49,383
My ribs are hurting. Here...

147
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:50,875
- Here?
 - Yes.

148
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:55,099
This is your belly, not your rib cage.

149
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,475
All right, your ribs are up here.

150
00:07:57,475 --> 00:08:02,483
Do a better job acting next time, or else it'll get awkward.

151
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:08,632
- I am hungry.
 - My child is hungry.

152
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:11,282
Why did you fall in front of this uncle's car?

153
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,183
Put on your slippers, quickly.

154
00:08:14,183 --> 00:08:15,899
Thank you, Doctor.

155
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,566
Hey.

156
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:25,257
I'm not in pain anymore.

157
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:26,924
No pain!

158
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,566
What a dream!

159
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:39,357
- This is for you.
 - Mom...

160
00:08:42,191 --> 00:08:44,791
- No, I won't take it.
 - Hey,

161
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,600
this is for you.

162
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,100
- When you are hungry, get something to eat, okay?
 - All right.

163
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,282
Promise me you won't do this again.

164
00:08:54,282 --> 00:08:56,650
- It's bad.
 - Okay.

165
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,625
Good girl.

166
00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:03,524
- Go home.
 - Okay. Mom, here.

167
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:05,307
He gave it to you so you keep it. Keep it safe.

168
00:09:05,307 --> 00:09:08,090
Remember his face. Make sure to say thank you whenever we see him again.

169
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,880
All right.

170
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,083
It would be best not to see each other again.

171
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:25,290
It would be best not to see each other again.

172
00:09:26,008 --> 00:09:28,408
It would be best not to see each other again.

173
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:31,400
Mom, why aren't you eating?

174
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:36,550
Are you skipping a meal cause you lost in gambling?

175
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:41,008
Do you like it? Here...

176
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:44,049
Ladies and Gentlemen,

177
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:46,515
as per our previous meeting's report,

178
00:09:46,515 --> 00:09:52,449
we are looking for a person to fill the deputy director position of our hospital.

179
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:57,024
Doctor Thanh is going to retire by the end of this year.

180
00:09:57,024 --> 00:10:00,774
In front of you is the list with our candidates.

181
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:04,050
Please take a look.

182
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:12,432
As you see, the results show that only Doctor Tung Son is left on the list.

183
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:13,991
Yes.

184
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:21,183
You have one month to get ready for the assignment and to present it in front of hospital directors.

185
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:23,507
For transparency,

186
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:30,816
I am going to invite some professors and PhDs from the Ministry of Health to join this event.

187
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:34,224
Madam, please take just one pill.

188
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:38,000
Then I will take you to every corner of this hospital.

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,525
Please just take one. Please...

190
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:42,674
Just this one pill, please...

191
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:44,541
Doctor.

192
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:48,207
Tell me why you don't want to take your medication.

193
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,807
- I want to eat sticky rice with sugar.
 - It's really sweet.

194
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:53,749
If we eat that, the sugar level in our bodies will increase.

195
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:55,724
Then our bodies will get tired, won't they?

196
00:10:55,724 --> 00:10:59,257
How about this? Let's have sticky rice with chicken. Let's eat that instead.

197
00:10:59,257 --> 00:11:01,533
It's better with drumsticks!

198
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:04,050
- Here we are.
 - Here it is.

199
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,340
This is your sticky rice with drumsticks. No, no, no.

200
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,640
- Now give me my medicine!
 - Medicine.

201
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,366
- Here.
 - Here it is.

202
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:12,732
Here you are.

203
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:16,299
All right, well done!

204
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:20,375
All done.

205
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,815
- Let's have some rest.
 - Sticky rice with chicken drumsticks!

206
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:25,965
Sticky rice with chicken drumsticks...

207
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:28,225
But they don't have chicken drumsticks. Is it okay with shredded chicken instead?

208
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:31,224
I know they are shredded from the chicken drumsticks.

209
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:32,991
Right... Yes.

210
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,450
- "A Ty, A Ty."
 - What?

211
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,725
It's me. She means "Nurse."

212
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:43,249
Nurse, please hide it for "A Tun", my son.

213
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:45,240
Don't let A Tun see it.

214
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,915
Let me tell you,

215
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,724
he's a grown-up. He won't eat this.

216
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:52,932
There's plenty of sticky rice out there. He can buy it whenever he wants.

217
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:57,441
The thing is, he is not going to visit you. Do you understand?

218
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:08,166
I mean, he is busy all the time. He doesn't have time to come here and visit you.

219
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:13,516
He's really busy at work. Yes, he's very busy.

220
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:18,416
Have some rest, Madam. He will visit you tonight. Get some rest.

221
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:31,015
Put it down.

222
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:32,716
Why?

223
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:35,849
You're not allowed to drink this coffee.

224
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:37,691
Is there something inside?

225
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:39,940
There are three "things."

226
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:44,940
First of all, drinking coffee during lunch, before eating, will cause your stomach to hurt.

227
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,441
Secondly, it contains more caffeine than milk.

228
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:49,565
It's going to affect your brain.

229
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:52,115
Then who would take care of your patients,

230
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:54,566
and of me?

231
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:03,225
Firstly, I already ate.

232
00:13:03,225 --> 00:13:07,240
Secondly, I ordered a strong coffee for myself

233
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,440
because I was exhausted from working on the assignment last night. So this morning,

234
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,283
I need to take in enough caffeine to stay awake.

235
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:19,199
You argue with me whenever I say anything.

236
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,890
That's because what you said was wrong.

237
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,300
How about the third one?

238
00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:28,557
When someone cares about a friend,

239
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,915
even though it's embarrassing,

240
00:13:31,915 --> 00:13:36,166
you should pretend that you're touched by the fact that I care.

241
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,233
Understood?

242
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:43,257
Stop talking nonsense. This is way too much.

243
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,865
What would you like to eat? It's my treat!

244
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:48,724
Are you on the menu?

245
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:51,391
It would be boring if you weren't!

246
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,475
I'm sorry.

247
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,274
Will you be able to work at the hospital tomorrow if you drink this much?

248
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:08,024
I drink a lot. Did you bring enough money?

249
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:11,475
Baby, I have nothing but money. Feel free.

250
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,741
Good! Wait for me.

251
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:19,215
Hey... Hey!

252
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:21,315
You are soon going to live abroad.

253
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:24,766
Leave her alone, or else Karma is going to find you!

254
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:28,124
I don't care. Having that hot woman would be great karma anyway.

255
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:30,600
Whatever...

256
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,815
Here.

257
00:14:32,816 --> 00:14:34,991
Cheers!

258
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Drink!

259
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:53,008
- Hey, let's go.
 - Whereto?

260
00:14:54,766 --> 00:14:57,166
Where is Cong?

261
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:24,030
I can't believe you are that kind of man!

262
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,850
You are about to move abroad, and now you go to the club to find yourself some women!

263
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,640
No, I only went there with my brothers.

264
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,274
- I'm going to die to show you.
 - Don't...

265
00:15:29,274 --> 00:15:31,550
- Don't worry. I'm coming home now. Don't die.
  - I'm going to kill myself.

266
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,007
I'm going to die right now!

267
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:35,108
Hey, Son...

268
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,174
My friend...

269
00:15:38,174 --> 00:15:41,183
"Design" somewhere for me to vomit.

270
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:44,490
Do whatever you want in my room. Good stuff is waiting for you in there too.

271
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,558
This way...

272
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,941
Not this way...

273
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:32,420
How come she looks so sexy?

274
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,924
No, Karma will find me.

275
00:16:35,924 --> 00:16:38,174
No, no, no...

276
00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:41,075
- Hey you!
 - I am here.

277
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:43,475
Watch you sleep?

278
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,308
Let me do it.

279
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:52,516
Only watching...

280
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:54,633
Don't...

281
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:01,557
Go to sleep.

282
00:17:01,557 --> 00:17:04,300
I am tired.

283
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,758
Do you remember?

284
00:18:21,441 --> 00:18:24,024
Hey!

285
00:18:24,024 --> 00:18:27,058
Who are you? Are you trying to run away?

286
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:28,666
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,340
I was so drunk yesterday that I don't remember anything.

288
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:36,358
Yesterday, your friends tried to get me drunk.

289
00:18:36,358 --> 00:18:39,290
Where's Cong? Where's Cong?

290
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,958
- He's sleeping.
 - Where?

291
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,949
At home... He went home yesterday.

292
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:48,183
Or should I call him here to talk with you?

293
00:18:48,183 --> 00:18:50,482
Tell me! Do you want to run away?

294
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:52,499
I have no idea who you are!

295
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,732
What is your name? Where are you from? Who is your family?

296
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:58,266
What if something happens? What the h*ll would I do?

297
00:19:00,191 --> 00:19:03,991
It would be best not to  see each other again.

298
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,041
Would you like me to remind you about last time?

299
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,700
There's no need.

300
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,357
As you tell the story,

301
00:19:23,358 --> 00:19:26,590
I feel terrible just thinking about it.

302
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,174
What do you want?

303
00:19:28,174 --> 00:19:34,308
I want you to make up for what my child and I went through during the past seven years.

304
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,758
You're still "aggressive," like before.

305
00:19:42,758 --> 00:19:45,666
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

306
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:50,482
We played an "adult game." Having a child is normal.

307
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,258
What?

308
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,341
The girl you crashed into...

309
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:02,808
She is your daughter.

310
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:07,783
How fortunate is that... right?

311
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:11,500
Since the heavens have given it, enjoy it.

312
00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:16,290
The heavens or just a game?

313
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,000
What are you doing?

314
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:22,491
The game has just started.

315
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:28,566
Oh my God! You are crazy!

316
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:33,700
Are you out of your mind? At that time, my wife told me to go home.

317
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,199
I haven't even touched her yet!

318
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,982
Oh my God, I was drunk as h*ll! How should I remember?

319
00:20:38,982 --> 00:20:42,090
Right, this lady seems to be a scammer.

320
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,800
It was my mistake. What if she belongs to someone else?

321
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,600
Stupid!

322
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,532
You are so stupid.

323
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:50,240
What is a DNA test for?

324
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,840
Come on! You are a doctor. You should know about that.

325
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,357
Think about it. That night, you may not have "eaten" her,

326
00:20:55,357 --> 00:20:57,924
but you must have done something.

327
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,025
That's bullsh*t!

328
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,815
A DNA test is very easy.

329
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:07,290
But what if my colleagues and Thuy Linh find out about it?

330
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,840
Moreover, I have my study abroad program.

331
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,791
I don't care what others think of you, but you've been watching me bathe for way too long now.

332
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:21,091
Mom,

333
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:22,840
what are you calculating?

334
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,840
How much did we spend, the past seven years?

335
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,099
That would be a huge amount! You lose it every day during gambling.

336
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:30,233
She always says inauspicious things!

337
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:32,600
Not that one?

338
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:34,608
Do you want to have a dad?

339
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:35,857
Yes, I want one,

340
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:38,233
but he has to be an awesome mafioso!

341
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:41,824
No, why would he? He only needs to have money.

342
00:21:41,824 --> 00:21:44,149
You would spend all the money on gambling anyway.

343
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:46,525
Stop cursing at me!

344
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:53,350
I told Chaien and Seiko I have a Mafia dad.

345
00:21:54,616 --> 00:21:57,865
- You really want a dad, don't you?
 - Yes.

346
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:04,391
Let me see. Your handwriting is a disaster!

347
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,008
Whatever! Having money is enough.

348
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:15,625
Hey, Doctor, are you free? Come calculate the last seven years with me!

349
00:22:16,258 --> 00:22:20,157
Are you deaf? I'm calling you. Hey!

350
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,341
What are you doing now?

351
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,558
What are you doing? Don't touch me! What do you want?

352
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:26,633
Why are you here?

353
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:29,874
I told you to give me some time to find out what happened that night, and then I'd come to find you.

354
00:22:29,874 --> 00:22:32,041
How much longer will it take? Another seven years?

355
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,966
- What?
 - Do you know how difficult it is to raise a child for seven years?

356
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:39,499
Do you know how hard it is to raise her alone? Do you understand?

357
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:43,315
How do I know if that child is mine? How do I know if you aren't lying?

358
00:22:43,315 --> 00:22:45,565
You "eat" it or throw it away! That's your business. Nobody cares.

359
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:48,966
I am her mom. I surely know who her dad is!

360
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:52,458
I want Hong An to have a dad.

361
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:55,657
Do you only want to make money out of this?

362
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:57,633
Do I want to make money out of this?

363
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:06,233
Let's see. How much did I spend these past seven years?

364
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:09,558
Take a DNA test, and you will know.

365
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,025
Okay, do you want money? I will give you money.

366
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:17,040
But on the condition that you  give me time to think about this situation.

367
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,650
Who are Hong An's parents?

368
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,266
Please hurry to the security office.

369
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:24,275
Hello, Dad.

370
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:28,550
How much more time do you need to think?

371
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,291
Take her home. I'll see you tonight.

372
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:34,258
Okay, tonight or else...

373
00:23:34,258 --> 00:23:37,616
I don't know what will happen tomorrow!

374
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:56,124
- What are you doing?
 - I'm checking your leg for you.

375
00:23:56,124 --> 00:23:58,883
Why? My head hurts.

376
00:23:59,858 --> 00:24:01,858
I am sorry.

377
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:09,233
Don't do this anymore, okay?

378
00:24:10,441 --> 00:24:13,915
- That's immoral.
 - You're right.

379
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:17,700
I am sorry. I will focus more.

380
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,066
I'm talking about your personal issue.

381
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,500
That is immoral!

382
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,650
- Do you know?
 - Of course I know.

383
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,257
What is done at night will eventually appear in the daytime.

384
00:24:40,257 --> 00:24:43,582
It's a big problem anyway.

385
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,483
Auntie, this one is very important to me.

386
00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:50,265
I hope you won't tell anyone.

387
00:24:50,265 --> 00:24:56,675
It's hard for me, but I pity you so I won't.

388
00:24:57,466 --> 00:25:01,124
Now you have to make sure that I won't.

389
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,524
How do you want me to do that?

390
00:25:02,524 --> 00:25:08,565
Between now and this afternoon, bring me chicken sticky rice,

391
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:10,233
but with drumsticks, okay?

392
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:12,899
Just chicken?

393
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,732
Make sure I get it before 4 p.m.

394
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:19,750
Otherwise, I will tell every single person in this hospital,

395
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,516
you...

396
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:26,007
took my chicken that day.

397
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:31,390
Don't be like this anymore, Doctor. That is "immoral."

398
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,958
Ch-Chicken...

399
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:36,715
I have a headache.

400
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:39,291
I have a headache, too. Have some rest, okay?

401
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:42,633
I'll take a look at you later.

402
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:59,390
- You're here. Where is your mom?
 - I am here.

403
00:26:00,483 --> 00:26:02,483
And you...

404
00:26:03,675 --> 00:26:07,075
Hey, where are you going?

405
00:26:07,075 --> 00:26:09,491
- Oh my God!
 - It's so beautiful.

406
00:26:09,491 --> 00:26:11,300
What a beautiful house!

407
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,058
It's just a rental home. Don't bring things out of order.

408
00:26:13,058 --> 00:26:15,032
I don't care as long as it's pretty.

409
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:18,133
What are you doing? Where are you going?

410
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:21,233
I'm going to look in which room we'll be staying, and clean up.

411
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:23,000
- What?
 - What?

412
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,424
You said you were going to let me know tonight.

413
00:26:25,424 --> 00:26:29,083
Why did you tell me you would take me to see my dad?

414
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:32,233
We are just meeting. Why did you bring your baggage?

415
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:35,899
We can't afford to pay the rent so the landlord kicked us out.

416
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:37,725
Oh my God!

417
00:26:37,725 --> 00:26:41,724
Sooner or later, you have to admit it so we'd better just move in here in advance.

418
00:26:41,724 --> 00:26:43,490
Is he my dad?

419
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,074
Your dad? You'd wish!

420
00:26:45,074 --> 00:26:47,075
Nice, I like it.

421
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,782
- What?
 - Get out of my house.

422
00:26:51,782 --> 00:26:53,583
No.

423
00:26:54,966 --> 00:26:58,540
Son, are you home?

424
00:26:59,725 --> 00:27:02,857
- Do you have someone else here tonight?
 - No way!

425
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:06,732
This is my sister. She just came to the village.

426
00:27:06,732 --> 00:27:08,641
What is your name?

427
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:11,491
Well, I am Thuy Linh.

428
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:13,482
- My daughter's name is Hong An.
 - Yes.

429
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:16,433
You probably know me, right?

430
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:18,266
No, not yet.

431
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,900
My name is Phuong.

432
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:26,615
You are here. Your daughter is here. Where is your husband?

433
00:27:26,615 --> 00:27:28,558
He passed away.

434
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:35,983
I am so sorry to hear that.

435
00:27:37,408 --> 00:27:40,150
I am a single mom,

436
00:27:40,783 --> 00:27:43,041
such a pity for my daughter.

437
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:45,716
She never met her dad.

438
00:27:45,716 --> 00:27:48,465
You know, he was the "have fun and run" type of man.

439
00:27:48,465 --> 00:27:51,333
Exactly the same... Their children are totally "like father, like son."

440
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,291
Look at this mole!

441
00:27:55,225 --> 00:27:57,058
Luckily, she looks like her uncle.

442
00:27:57,058 --> 00:27:59,775
Her dad doesn't have it.

443
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:04,675
How lucky you are!

444
00:28:04,675 --> 00:28:06,908
We often wanted to remove it,

445
00:28:06,908 --> 00:28:08,983
but it cost â‚«10,000,000 so we didn't.

446
00:28:08,983 --> 00:28:10,907
- Indeed, don't remove it. It's a waste of money.
 - You're right!

447
00:28:10,907 --> 00:28:12,490
It brings good luck.

448
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,325
That's right. That one helps us make some money.

449
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:16,825
I...

450
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:18,991
gradually make money.

451
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,400
Poor you and your daughter...

452
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:31,441
Sister, after visiting me, you're going back home, right?

453
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:33,250
No way!

454
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:38,716
No, my daughter is sick. May we stay here so she can be cared for?

455
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:41,408
At least she still has an uncle here.

456
00:28:42,966 --> 00:28:45,775
If that's the case, you should stay here.

457
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,325
That's right.

458
00:28:49,991 --> 00:28:52,940
- Hey, Baby.
 - What?

459
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:59,016
We have a dinner reservation tonight. We may be late.

460
00:28:59,016 --> 00:29:02,182
I forgot. Let's go, Darling.

461
00:29:02,182 --> 00:29:05,565
We're going out for dinner. Help yourself at home.

462
00:29:05,565 --> 00:29:08,580
Child, go to sleep early, okay?

463
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:13,116
- Let's go, Darling.
 - Mom, I am starving.

464
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:22,050
Then... would you like to come with us?

465
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,000
Hong An!

466
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,158
- Hong An, come over here!
 - All right.

467
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,250
Mom, what's going on?

468
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,957
- That hurts.
 - Sit here!

469
00:29:45,008 --> 00:29:50,132
This is a fancy restaurant. I can't afford to pay for your mess.

470
00:29:50,132 --> 00:29:53,507
That's fine. We will take care of it.

471
00:29:53,507 --> 00:29:56,866
- It's okay.
 - She's going to kill them all.

472
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:03,257
My daughter is so naughty.

473
00:30:03,257 --> 00:30:06,449
We should wait outside so you can enjoy your dinner.

474
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:11,765
No, it is totally fine. If you go, we won't feel comfortable.

475
00:30:11,765 --> 00:30:15,549
- Right, Honey?
 - Yes.

476
00:30:20,283 --> 00:30:23,982
We're going to become family members anyway, aren't we?

477
00:30:23,982 --> 00:30:27,657
You're right! It looks like you guys are about to get married.

478
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:30,441
He seems like a good man. Grab him while you can.

479
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:34,930
Would you like to order? Otherwise, they will close their kitchen.

480
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,399
- What do you want to eat?
 - I want French fries.

481
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:39,640
No, we should order lobster here.

482
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,532
No, I want French fries first!

483
00:30:41,532 --> 00:30:42,625
- Lobster.
 - No.

484
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:46,191
Don't push her if she doesn't like to eat that, right, Honey?

485
00:30:47,608 --> 00:30:49,340
- Enjoy your dinner.
 - Thank you.

486
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,140
Thank you so much. Eat!

487
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,508
Don't be shy.

488
00:30:54,508 --> 00:30:55,732
Here,

489
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:57,616
enjoy your food, Honey.

490
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:00,633
That much? How could we eat all of that?

491
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:02,407
Why not? There are four of us.

492
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:04,624
Correct, don't worry, "Uncle." We also have Mun.

493
00:31:04,624 --> 00:31:06,425
Oh, yes.

494
00:31:06,425 --> 00:31:08,633
Come on. Let's eat.

495
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,066
- Eat, Honey.
 - Okay.

496
00:31:17,866 --> 00:31:19,966
What is this?

497
00:31:20,575 --> 00:31:23,624
Hong An has been sick and hasn't had any appetite lately,

498
00:31:23,624 --> 00:31:25,574
but today she really enjoys the food.

499
00:31:25,574 --> 00:31:28,433
I'm going to take it out so she can have it for breakfast tomorrow.

500
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:31,483
Lobster for breakfast?

501
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:34,900
We eat whatever we have. I can't make requests.

502
00:31:35,991 --> 00:31:38,199
What if she can't finish it?

503
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:42,132
It's all right, Honey. We hardly have dinner together like this.

504
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,374
- Check, please.
 - I already asked for it, Honey.

505
00:31:46,374 --> 00:31:47,758
No, you can't do that.

506
00:31:47,758 --> 00:31:49,307
If you'd pay, I would feel so bad!

507
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,740
Yes, I feel bad, too.

508
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,240
- All right, let me pay this bill.
 - Okay, go ahead.

509
00:31:56,466 --> 00:31:58,699
He's joking. I already did.

510
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:01,125
Let's go home.

511
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:04,832
I knew it. Thank you!

512
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,550
Come here and let's talk.

513
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,641
What?

514
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:28,115
You're full, aren't you? What else do you want?

515
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:31,890
I already told you. I want my child to have a dad.

516
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,365
Don't I keep telling you?

517
00:32:34,365 --> 00:32:36,308
I need more time.

518
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:40,375
During this time, I have a lot of things to take care of. I just can'tâ€”

519
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,325
What for? How much more time?

520
00:32:43,325 --> 00:32:46,174
Because of that Linh?

521
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:48,657
Tell me what else you have to do? Let me help you out.

522
00:32:48,657 --> 00:32:50,283
It's personal.

523
00:32:50,283 --> 00:32:52,716
All right, what nowâ€”

524
00:32:55,783 --> 00:32:57,583
What?

525
00:32:59,075 --> 00:33:00,975
A new place?

526
00:33:00,975 --> 00:33:03,050
Okay, I know.

527
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,399
Do you have money? Lend me some.

528
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:07,200
You'd wish!

529
00:33:09,158 --> 00:33:11,058
Let's see.

530
00:33:21,616 --> 00:33:24,216
Dad, I am hungry.

531
00:33:24,758 --> 00:33:26,975
I am hungry.

532
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:31,950
Tell your mom.

533
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,391
Dad, read this.

534
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:42,783
What the h*ll is going on so early in the morning?

535
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:46,549
I took some money for my business trip. I'll be back tomorrow.

536
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:48,650
Thank you.

537
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:06,724
She won't pick up the phone.

538
00:34:06,724 --> 00:34:09,283
When will she pick up?

539
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:11,015
When she goes broke, Dad.

540
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:14,116
What? Again...

541
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,830
[Gia An]

542
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:28,091
Make sure you remember what I told you.

543
00:34:28,091 --> 00:34:30,783
When someone asks you who you are, what do you tell them?

544
00:34:30,783 --> 00:34:32,724
I'll say, "I am a daughter of my mom."

545
00:34:32,724 --> 00:34:34,449
"My mom is Uncle Nam's daughter,"

546
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,674
"a niece of Eighth Auntie, sister of Grandpa Tam,"

547
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,490
"from Uncle Ba and Auntie Sau's side."

548
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,708
Yes. What about me? Who am I?

549
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:43,025
- Daddy.
 - No.

550
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:45,374
I am your "Uncle Ba," understand?

551
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,458
Why do I have to lie?

552
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:50,356
"Grown-ups" said children should not lie!

553
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,033
This is not a lie.

554
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:56,400
It's just a little bit off from the truth.

555
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,900
As long as it's not going to hurt anyone, it's fine, okay?

556
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,850
So what do you want to say?

557
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,666
I want that someday,

558
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:09,490
you will tell everybody in the hospital that

559
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,591
I am your daughter...

560
00:35:11,591 --> 00:35:13,616
or not.

561
00:35:13,616 --> 00:35:15,700
I'll be late.

562
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:19,199
Don't be scared. Nobody's here.

563
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,257
What if someone suddenly shows up?

564
00:35:21,257 --> 00:35:23,408
Oh my goodness, someone appeared!

565
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:28,232
- Good morning, Doctor!
 - Good morning.

566
00:35:29,575 --> 00:35:32,450
Who left a little girl here?

567
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,315
Is she your niece, Doctor?

568
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:36,349
I am the daughter of my mom.

569
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:39,015
My mom is Uncle Nam's daughter,

570
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:41,408
a niece of Eighth Auntie...

571
00:35:44,116 --> 00:35:48,116
Oh my God, I forgot.

572
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:55,082
She is Sixth Aunt's grandchild. She is my niece.

573
00:35:55,783 --> 00:35:57,349
On my, what a sweetie!

574
00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:01,782
- Next time, just say you are his niece.
 - Okay.

575
00:36:01,782 --> 00:36:03,324
One look, and I knew you were related.

576
00:36:03,324 --> 00:36:05,265
Look at this mole! Just the same as the one you have, Doctor.

577
00:36:05,265 --> 00:36:07,691
But why is yours bigger?

578
00:36:07,691 --> 00:36:10,383
You're hilarious!

579
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:21,340
You two look like father and daughter.

580
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,499
Really, do you think so?

581
00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:25,916
So do I.

582
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,649
No way, not like father and daughter.

583
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:31,291
This little girl is a hundred times prettier than the doctor!

584
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,366
Here you go again.

585
00:36:34,616 --> 00:36:36,441
We're here. Say goodbye, Baby.

586
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:37,841
Goodbye.

587
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:40,649
Stop being sarcastic. I know who I am. That's why I don't have a husband!

588
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:43,383
- You're "too much."
 - Whatever!

589
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:45,583
- Apparently, we are here.
 - We're supposed to be on this floor!

590
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:48,208
Why do we keep fighting like this?

591
00:36:49,025 --> 00:36:50,749
Oh my, Doctor Son's niece is so smart!

592
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:54,049
Miss Van never listens to anyone, but today she listened to her and took her medicine.

593
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:57,765
If I had a daughter like her, I could raise a hundred children like Au Co.

594
00:36:57,765 --> 00:37:00,415
- Are you talking about my niece?
 - Yes, your niece! Who else?

595
00:37:00,415 --> 00:37:03,690
My nieces are so bad. Like h*ll, I just want to slap their butts a few times.

596
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,191
D-Doctor...

597
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:08,474
One day, I will bring Mun here to play with you all.

598
00:37:08,474 --> 00:37:11,949
She is very smart. She understands everything.

599
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:16,807
All right, you must keep your promise, okay?

600
00:37:16,807 --> 00:37:20,983
We will soon have "dog meat" to "enjoy."

601
00:37:21,933 --> 00:37:26,207
Hey, come here. Let them all rest. Come with me.

602
00:37:26,207 --> 00:37:28,325
Okay.

603
00:37:28,325 --> 00:37:30,249
Let's go. Say goodbye to them.

604
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:32,558
Goodbye, Madam.

605
00:37:32,558 --> 00:37:34,983
Goodbye, Madam.

606
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,150
That hurts!

607
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:53,007
What did I tell you?

608
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:55,832
Don't go anywhere, and don't tell any nonsense.

609
00:37:55,832 --> 00:37:58,324
Why did you go there, talking with them and not letting them rest?

610
00:37:58,324 --> 00:38:00,407
No, I played with them.

611
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:03,091
And I didn't tell any "nonsense."

612
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:05,324
Are you arguing with me? Like who?

613
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,325
Same as you!

614
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:13,141
Hey...

615
00:38:13,141 --> 00:38:16,791
Stop retorting, okay?

616
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:22,291
Nobody taught you how to communicate right. The way you are talking is very rude.

617
00:38:22,808 --> 00:38:24,783
As you know,

618
00:38:24,783 --> 00:38:28,499
I don't have a dad so nobody taught me.

619
00:38:28,499 --> 00:38:31,983
Doctor, Doctor, come with me! The patient in room nine has gone into shock.

620
00:38:31,983 --> 00:38:33,783
Okay.

621
00:38:33,783 --> 00:38:35,483
Stay here nicely.

622
00:38:35,483 --> 00:38:38,475
"Uncle Ba" will be back, okay?

623
00:38:38,475 --> 00:38:40,758
- Let's go.
 - All right.

624
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:47,441
Fine! You bring me here and now you leave me.

625
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:03,033
Where are you, Hong An?

626
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,890
Hong An!

627
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,808
Child, you stay here! You're such a crafty child!

628
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,874
You're this little, yet you know how to steal other people's wallets! You have no manners!

629
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:18,390
- No, I didn't steal your wallet.
 - If not you, then who did?

630
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,590
My wallet obviously was inside my bag!

631
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,124
- You're denying it!
 - Hey, Miss, what are you doing?

632
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:24,907
Oh, Lord! This girl tried to steal my wallet!

633
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:26,575
- Who are you?
 - I am her uncle.

634
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:30,124
Her uncle? How come you let her do this? Take her home and teach her, please!

635
00:39:30,124 --> 00:39:32,699
She's only this small, but she already knows how to pick pockets!

636
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:34,591
I'm sorry, Miss.

637
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:37,216
Sweetie,

638
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:41,374
- say sorry and give it back to her.
 - Why? I didn't steal her wallet.

639
00:39:41,374 --> 00:39:43,899
- Say sorry and give it back to her right now.
 - I didn't do it!

640
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:45,974
What? Admit it! Stop lying.

641
00:39:45,974 --> 00:39:47,974
I did not do this!

642
00:39:47,974 --> 00:39:49,675
- D*mn it!
 - Miss, what are you doing?

643
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:52,550
She did not admit it! Obviously, I went to go shopping!

644
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,065
What made my purse open up, causing my wallet to fall on the ground?

645
00:39:55,065 --> 00:39:56,432
If not her, then who did it?

646
00:39:56,432 --> 00:39:58,208
- Is this one yours?
 - Of course it's mine!

647
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,740
Double-check if you are missing anything, please.

648
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,074
Thank God, nothing is missing, or else I would drag your a*s to the police!

649
00:40:03,074 --> 00:40:06,465
Hey, Miss, how did you know my niece did it?

650
00:40:06,465 --> 00:40:09,991
Hey, Young Brother and everybody here witnessed it. Isn't that right?

651
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,541
Isn't it?

652
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:14,800
Really? This guy... is a drug addict!

653
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,357
- For sure, he tried to steal the wallet!
 - Catch him!

654
00:40:17,357 --> 00:40:22,129
Oh, no, why did we blame this poor little girl?

655
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,491
I am sorry.

656
00:40:29,491 --> 00:40:32,025
Please forgive me.

657
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:34,840
I am so sorry.

658
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,908
I kept telling you, but you didn't trust me.

659
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:40,657
I said, I was sorry.

660
00:40:40,657 --> 00:40:43,400
Please don't cry.

661
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:49,132
I just wanted to help her pick up that wallet. I did not do anything wrong.

662
00:40:49,132 --> 00:40:50,674
I'm so sorry.

663
00:40:50,674 --> 00:40:52,816
I'm sorry. Forgive me, please.

664
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:55,483
Please, don't cry. Don't cry.

665
00:40:55,483 --> 00:40:57,783
All right, here you go.

666
00:40:57,783 --> 00:40:59,699
How much...

667
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:01,890
Bet some more.

668
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,116
Put some more in.

669
00:41:04,116 --> 00:41:06,950
Put some more in!

670
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,141
Hands up.

671
00:41:09,141 --> 00:41:11,670
- All right, let's bet â‚«100,000.
 - Okay.

672
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,650
Be careful while dealing.

673
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,000
- Really?
 - Pull.

674
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,525
- Slowly.
 - Oh my God!

675
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:23,965
There are so many toys for you here.

676
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:26,507
Why are you still upset with me, Sweetie?

677
00:41:26,507 --> 00:41:30,424
I am sorry, Baby. I told you I didn't mean it.

678
00:41:30,424 --> 00:41:35,457
My mom only takes money from the rich, from the bad, to give to the poor.

679
00:41:35,457 --> 00:41:40,030
She never takes anything from the poor or the elderly.

680
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,800
Then...

681
00:41:42,525 --> 00:41:46,090
This morning she took it from me.

682
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,490
Do you mean she thinks I am a bad person?

683
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:51,499
Really, did she take your money this morning?

684
00:41:51,499 --> 00:41:52,782
Yes.

685
00:41:52,782 --> 00:41:55,532
Then she is wrong.

686
00:41:55,532 --> 00:41:58,507
This one sounds acceptable.

687
00:41:58,507 --> 00:42:00,449
What? Don't you eat mushrooms?

688
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:05,407
- No, I am scared mushrooms make my belly hurt.
 - So am I.

689
00:42:05,407 --> 00:42:07,625
If I eat it, I will get a stomachache.

690
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,616
- They're terrible!
 - Yes, they are.

691
00:42:09,616 --> 00:42:12,557
Anyway, we're still friends now, aren't we?

692
00:42:12,557 --> 00:42:14,058
No.

693
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,341
Come on, what else do you want?

694
00:42:17,341 --> 00:42:19,582
- Do you really want to be friends with me again?
 - Yes.

695
00:42:19,582 --> 00:42:22,383
Come here, and I'll whisper it in your ear.

696
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:35,465
- Hey.
 - Hey, Handsome, come in.

697
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:37,407
This is my dad, my dad!

698
00:42:37,407 --> 00:42:39,958
- Your dad?
 - Daddy.

699
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:41,958
All right, do you remember?

700
00:42:42,975 --> 00:42:47,299
But I am not your dad. I can't say that.

701
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:50,857
Don't worry. Saying this won't hurt anyone, right?

702
00:42:50,857 --> 00:42:53,032
You said that before, remember?

703
00:42:53,032 --> 00:42:55,033
But...

704
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:59,790
Do it for me, please.

705
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:04,200
Chaien and Seiko both have dads.

706
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,550
Only I don't have a dad. They are always teasing me.

707
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:29,783
Daddy, sit here.

708
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:40,540
- Why does your face look like that?
 - Your place looks scary.

709
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:45,325
Don't be scared, Daddy. They look bad, but deep down, they are kind.

710
00:43:45,325 --> 00:43:49,300
You wretched woman! Stop right there! I'm going to beat you right now.

711
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,690
Stop right there!

712
00:43:50,691 --> 00:43:53,033
Who are you beating?

713
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,900
Oh my heavens!

714
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,649
Should we call the police?

715
00:44:00,649 --> 00:44:05,382
Don't worry. They usually fight on the street, not inside the home.

716
00:44:05,382 --> 00:44:07,933
It's safest inside the house.

717
00:44:09,641 --> 00:44:11,641
D*mn it!

718
00:44:12,258 --> 00:44:14,299
Hey, Child, what are you looking at?

719
00:44:14,299 --> 00:44:17,591
Keep going! I don't dare to have an opinion.

720
00:44:25,825 --> 00:44:28,857
- Is he finished?
 - He finished a long time ago.

721
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:33,265
Can I go home?

722
00:44:33,265 --> 00:44:36,857
Stay here with me, Daddy. I will protect you!

723
00:44:36,857 --> 00:44:39,366
- It's scary.
 - Hong An!

724
00:44:39,366 --> 00:44:41,816
Hong An, who is that?

725
00:44:51,725 --> 00:44:53,932
Hong An, where have you been lately?

726
00:44:53,932 --> 00:44:56,099
I have not seen you for a while.

727
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:58,408
And who is this man?

728
00:44:58,408 --> 00:45:01,933
- He is my dad.
 - What?

729
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:05,340
How come you don't look like him?

730
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,782
What?

731
00:45:06,782 --> 00:45:11,824
Who said I don't? My dad is an "authentic" mafioso.

732
00:45:11,824 --> 00:45:16,183
An "authentic" mafioso... Mafia...

733
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,382
Yes, I am an authentic mafioso.

734
00:45:19,382 --> 00:45:23,232
- Which area do you handle?
 - The emergency room.

735
00:45:23,232 --> 00:45:26,974
Hey, hospital, hospital, hospital...

736
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:30,932
I handle the hospital area.

737
00:45:30,932 --> 00:45:35,507
I mean, I take care of the hospital, the gas station, the morgue and so on.

738
00:45:35,507 --> 00:45:36,833
Even the morgue!

739
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,765
Really? That is so creepy!

740
00:45:38,765 --> 00:45:40,549
Not just that...

741
00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:44,207
Every day, people die in my area.

742
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:47,415
Death is nothing to me.

743
00:45:47,415 --> 00:45:49,841
Are you scared?

744
00:45:49,841 --> 00:45:52,574
Murderer!

745
00:45:52,574 --> 00:45:55,724
I'm joking. I'm a doctor.

746
00:45:55,724 --> 00:45:58,165
- I give injections to the patients.
 - Yes, indeed.

747
00:45:58,165 --> 00:46:00,424
- Oh, I know.
 - Good.

748
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,932
Do you give injections to the dogs?

749
00:46:03,932 --> 00:46:06,240
- Yes, you're right.
 - No, it's not like that.

750
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,050
For animals, doctors are called "veterinarians."

751
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:14,415
But I'm a doctor. Someone who saves people is called a "doctor." Do you understand?

752
00:46:14,415 --> 00:46:17,840
But you can give injections to dogs as well, can't you?

753
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,465
No, I can'tâ€”

754
00:46:19,465 --> 00:46:25,066
He can give injections to pigs, dogs, chickens, and all types.

755
00:46:26,266 --> 00:46:29,216
Hong An's father...

756
00:46:29,216 --> 00:46:32,183
He is a "whatever mafioso!"

757
00:46:32,183 --> 00:46:34,649
Chaien, Seiko, come home now!

758
00:46:34,649 --> 00:46:36,750
All right!

759
00:46:38,475 --> 00:46:45,275
See you later, Mr. Whatever-mafia.

760
00:46:53,566 --> 00:46:55,866
Whatever-mafia...

761
00:46:55,866 --> 00:46:58,590
Who are they?

762
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:00,265
They are my friends.

763
00:47:00,265 --> 00:47:02,866
Your friends?

764
00:47:02,866 --> 00:47:05,266
That's why!

765
00:47:05,266 --> 00:47:07,650
Are you okay?

766
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,399
- Such a harmful pizza!
 - Dad!

767
00:47:18,399 --> 00:47:20,716
I remember I didn't eat mushrooms.

768
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:24,082
Here you are. Take this to refresh yourself.

769
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:29,220
Is it better, Dad?

770
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,849
Better... but my tummy is still a bit hurt.

771
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:35,633
Drink some water, Dad.

772
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:37,683
Thank you.

773
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:44,990
What is it?

774
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:47,699
What is inside? The taste is weird and sour.

775
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:50,415
- That is the water from the well.
 - How can you drink this?

776
00:47:50,415 --> 00:47:53,641
Let me drink. It's good.

777
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:02,440
- Seriously?
 - It's totally normal water.

778
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,520
Oh, my goodness, it's hot.

779
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,890
Is there no fan here?

780
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:10,615
No, we don't have one.

781
00:48:10,615 --> 00:48:13,374
My mom said we need to save money to buy a house,

782
00:48:13,374 --> 00:48:15,320
not a fan.

783
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,150
Before... Isn't this...

784
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:21,440
So this is not your house.

785
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,224
No. No, we're just renting this place.

786
00:48:25,224 --> 00:48:28,008
But where did you live before?

787
00:48:28,008 --> 00:48:31,408
- Me? On the street.
 - What?

788
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:36,307
Because mom lives in the casino so I live on the street.

789
00:48:36,307 --> 00:48:39,765
On the street, I could play whenever I wanted to. It was so much fun!

790
00:48:41,858 --> 00:48:44,475
Don't you go to school?

791
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:50,490
My mom said I'm too young to go to school.

792
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:55,375
I can go when I get older.

793
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:05,065
Doctor, Chaien's dad has passed out! Please help him.

794
00:49:05,065 --> 00:49:07,400
Take me there right now.

795
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,100
Move. Please move.

796
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,570
- Stay away, please.
 - Make way! He's a doctor!

797
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:15,333
- Wake up, Daddy!
 - Give me something for his head.

798
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:16,850
Give me something, please. Thanks, Miss...

799
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:18,525
- Calm down, Chaien!
 - But this is my dad!

800
00:49:18,525 --> 00:49:21,332
- But my dad can help your dad.
 - What happened with Dad, Mother?

801
00:49:21,332 --> 00:49:23,624
His heart stopped. Call the ambulance, please!

802
00:49:23,624 --> 00:49:25,825
Daddy!

803
00:49:44,683 --> 00:49:46,383
He's conscious!

804
00:49:49,866 --> 00:49:53,225
- Mr. Mole, what is your name?
 - I am Tung Son.

805
00:49:53,225 --> 00:49:54,707
- Are you a doctor?
 - Yes, I am.

806
00:49:54,707 --> 00:49:56,207
Thank you, Doctor Tung Son.

807
00:49:56,207 --> 00:50:00,408
Thanks to him, this fatty man came back to life.

808
00:50:05,391 --> 00:50:09,891
Daddy, how did you know how to save Chaien's father?

809
00:50:09,891 --> 00:50:14,357
Since I am a doctor, that was "easy-peasy."

810
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:17,533
You are awesome, Dad!

811
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:23,858
See?

812
00:50:23,858 --> 00:50:27,641
You were out this afternoon. Now you have a sunstroke!

813
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:31,374
- Let me adjust the temperature.
 - No, it's okay, Dad.

814
00:50:31,374 --> 00:50:33,441
- All right.
 - Okay.

815
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:36,733
- Daddy, can I borrow your hand?
 - What?

816
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:40,500
- What?
 - Your hand...

817
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,500
- Why?
 - Give it to me. Then you'll know.

818
00:50:47,208 --> 00:50:49,974
- It smells dirty!
 - Does it smell dirty?

819
00:50:49,974 --> 00:50:52,933
It's smelly, but I love it!

820
00:50:55,683 --> 00:50:58,724
- You're such a weird one!
 - I don't mind.

821
00:50:58,724 --> 00:51:03,191
Whenever I am with you, I'm so happy.

822
00:51:08,808 --> 00:51:10,908
Here's some porridge.

823
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:18,491
Here, open your mouth.

824
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:22,991
Good girl.

825
00:52:16,141 --> 00:52:18,766
Son speaking.

826
00:52:21,741 --> 00:52:24,441
I was wrong.

827
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,024
Forgive me, Mr. Ma.

828
00:52:28,024 --> 00:52:31,200
I promise I will give you your money back.

829
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,741
Help me, please.

830
00:52:32,741 --> 00:52:35,933
They're going to cut off my hand because I can't pay him back!

831
00:52:35,933 --> 00:52:40,349
Shut up! What a big mouth! Be careful, or I'll cut your tongue.

832
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:45,425
Son, did you bring all the money?

833
00:52:46,925 --> 00:52:49,025
I'm still missing some.

834
00:52:49,025 --> 00:52:50,816
I am sorry.

835
00:52:50,816 --> 00:52:55,307
What do you mean? Can't you even withdraw â‚«50,000,000 without some of it still missing? Are you joking with me?

836
00:52:55,307 --> 00:52:59,565
I'm telling you the truth. When I was at the bank this morning to withdraw the money, it was very busy.

837
00:52:59,565 --> 00:53:01,607
I had to go to the ATM to withdraw the money.

838
00:53:01,607 --> 00:53:06,074
I was able to withdraw the â‚«30,000,000 left on my card.

839
00:53:06,074 --> 00:53:09,874
Oh, God, how is that enough?

840
00:53:09,874 --> 00:53:13,908
All right, leave her hand.

841
00:53:13,908 --> 00:53:16,265
- Cut two fingers and feed them to the dogs.
 - Okay!

842
00:53:16,265 --> 00:53:20,800
Wait! Don't cut! Please...

843
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,657
These fingers are used to deal cards.

844
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,215
Are you still thinking about gambling? Cut her entire hand off for me!

845
00:53:25,215 --> 00:53:28,574
I will sew them for her later, free of charge!

846
00:53:28,574 --> 00:53:32,391
Wait! He's not your grandfather. Why are you listening to him?

847
00:53:32,391 --> 00:53:35,175
Hey, don't you think you've gone too far?

848
00:53:35,175 --> 00:53:38,307
Think about the seven years I raised your daughter!

849
00:53:38,307 --> 00:53:42,649
That does not relate to this. It has not yet been defined she's my child!

850
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:45,775
Cut it now! Cut the entire hand!

851
00:53:45,775 --> 00:53:48,380
I will stitch them up later!

852
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:51,725
On the way to the hospital, take this for a paternity test.

853
00:53:51,725 --> 00:53:53,999
- Did you just threaten me?
 - Yes!

854
00:53:53,999 --> 00:53:55,666
- Go ahead!
 - Cut them!

855
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,274
- Cut!
 - Cut now!

856
00:53:57,274 --> 00:53:59,908
- Cut.
 - You cut it for me. Cut now!

857
00:53:59,908 --> 00:54:02,057
Cut so she can get rid of her habit! She's gambling all the time!

858
00:54:02,057 --> 00:54:04,382
- It doesn't matter how sick your daughter is at home!
 - Cut it!

859
00:54:04,382 --> 00:54:07,090
Cut it! Cut them!

860
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:20,382
- Is she your cousin?
 - Yes.

861
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,507
Why have I never heard about her before?

862
00:54:22,507 --> 00:54:24,550
Why would I have to tell you?

863
00:54:25,675 --> 00:54:29,975
Her story is her husband doesn't believe her daughter is his "real" daughter.

864
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:35,933
She wants to prove he's wrong by having him take a paternity test.

865
00:54:35,933 --> 00:54:37,924
Why doesn't her husband trust her?

866
00:54:37,924 --> 00:54:40,165
Do we still have such men on Earth?

867
00:54:40,165 --> 00:54:42,066
Yes, of course.

868
00:54:42,066 --> 00:54:45,157
I am out of luck so I met an a*shole.

869
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,425
He is a "have fun and run" man.

870
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,707
Again, are there still men like that on Earth?

871
00:54:51,707 --> 00:54:55,190
It got even worse when he said to me,

872
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:57,540
"It would be best not to see each other again."

873
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,332
I cannot forget this.

874
00:54:59,332 --> 00:55:01,791
That phrase sticks in my mind like a clue.

875
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,966
- Really?
 - Yes.

876
00:55:07,316 --> 00:55:12,425
So a man like that got  her pregnant and ran away?

877
00:55:13,233 --> 00:55:15,057
He has such bad eyes!

878
00:55:15,057 --> 00:55:19,582
If I were him, I would "run to you."

879
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:23,574
Yes, he did "hit" me.

880
00:55:23,574 --> 00:55:26,420
- That sounds good.
 - But still he refused to accept his daughter.

881
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,810
Why?

882
00:55:27,815 --> 00:55:31,315
For now, I wish for my daughter to have a dad,

883
00:55:31,315 --> 00:55:34,050
even if I'd die trying.

884
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:37,915
I sympathize with you. I will help you.

885
00:55:37,915 --> 00:55:40,899
That man should not have been born in this world!

886
00:55:40,899 --> 00:55:43,115
- Betrayer!
 - Buffoon!

887
00:55:43,115 --> 00:55:45,257
He lives without morality!

888
00:55:45,257 --> 00:55:49,382
- If he had a child, that child would...
 - Hey,

889
00:55:49,382 --> 00:55:52,407
don't talk about people who are not here.

890
00:55:52,407 --> 00:55:56,682
Yes, you're right. He's not here. We shouldn't talk behind his back.

891
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,224
Did he pass away?

892
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:02,465
Sorry, I'll let it slip.

893
00:56:02,465 --> 00:56:05,566
Are you crazy? He is still alive!

894
00:56:13,158 --> 00:56:15,357
Doctor, we have the result of the paternity test.

895
00:56:15,357 --> 00:56:18,275
Okay, I'm coming back now.

896
00:56:56,333 --> 00:57:00,016
What is it? Hey, what is it?

897
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,790
- Why did you come home so late?
 - I had to go to work.

898
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,199
Today is your daughter's birthday! Why did you come home this late?

899
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:12,116
I wasn't aware of that.

900
00:57:12,116 --> 00:57:13,865
Don't you remember your daughter's birthday?

901
00:57:13,865 --> 00:57:17,282
I could forget my own birthday, but absolutely not those of my children!

902
00:57:17,282 --> 00:57:22,007
Here... Not just my children's, I even remember his birthday.

903
00:57:22,007 --> 00:57:25,333
Stop it. You're being weird. Don't be so loud, or else she will hear us.

904
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:28,375
- Give him the birthday hat.
 - Okay.

905
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:31,466
Go. Go in.

906
00:57:34,308 --> 00:57:36,182
Hong An, Children, come down here.

907
00:57:36,182 --> 00:57:38,300
Okay.

908
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:44,800
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª
 â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

909
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:51,050
 â™ª Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday, Hong An! â™ª

910
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:54,400
Happy birthday to you, Baby!

911
00:57:57,033 --> 00:57:59,533
Here, Hong An,

912
00:57:59,533 --> 00:58:01,457
this is your birthday cake.

913
00:58:01,457 --> 00:58:04,615
Don't give it to her! Take it to the table so she can blow out the candles.

914
00:58:04,615 --> 00:58:06,825
Come here, Baby. Here...

915
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:12,033
Yes, lower it a bit. Here...

916
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:14,350
Okay, blow them out.

917
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,033
Wait!

918
00:58:16,033 --> 00:58:18,791
First of all, make a wish.

919
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,550
- Blow.
 - Blow.

920
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:29,315
- What did you wish for?
 - Maybe she wished for her mom to have more money.

921
00:58:29,315 --> 00:58:32,532
No, she wished for her mom to become God of Fortune.

922
00:58:32,532 --> 00:58:35,215
Stop! Don't talk like that.

923
00:58:35,215 --> 00:58:37,380
- Yes.
 - No.

924
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,110
No.

925
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:43,375
No, I wish for my parents to always stay here with me.

926
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,874
That is so typical!

927
00:58:45,874 --> 00:58:48,124
See, your parents are always here with you.

928
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,125
- Isn't that right, Dad?
 - Yes.

929
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:54,441
Okay, that's not important. What's important is that there are gifts!

930
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:57,707
This... this is for you!

931
00:58:57,707 --> 00:59:00,882
That's from me. I'm giving it to you, Hong An!

932
00:59:00,882 --> 00:59:02,524
All right. All right, now.

933
00:59:02,524 --> 00:59:05,725
Thank you. Do you even have a gift for me, Seiko?

934
00:59:05,725 --> 00:59:09,115
- My sponsor?
 - Thank you so much!

935
00:59:09,115 --> 00:59:10,815
How about Mr. Mole?

936
00:59:10,815 --> 00:59:12,933
His gift...

937
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:18,399
This is our gift for you.

938
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:21,041
Thank you so much.

939
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:24,841
Everybody, let's enjoy dinner!

940
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:39,720
- Bye.
 - Bye bye.

941
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:43,258
Goodbye, Mr. Mole.

942
00:59:43,258 --> 00:59:45,333
Take care on your way home.

943
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:47,732
Mom, where is Mun?

944
00:59:47,732 --> 00:59:51,332
- I don't know. Go look for her.
 - Okay.

945
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:54,475
Mun!

946
00:59:54,475 --> 00:59:55,891
Hey,

947
00:59:55,891 --> 00:59:59,174
what's wrong with you tonight? It's your daughter's birthday! Why did you put on a poker face all night?

948
00:59:59,174 --> 01:00:02,366
Hey, hey, I'm talking to you. Where are you going?

949
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:04,850
- Have you had enough?
 - No.

950
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:08,790
Not yet, I paid â‚«300,000 for the taxi.

951
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:11,640
And this was the first time in my life I arranged a birthday party for her.

952
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:15,175
- It's not that expensiveâ€”
 - I want to know if the both of you have had enough.

953
01:00:15,175 --> 01:00:20,065
As you know, life is full of ups and downs.

954
01:00:20,065 --> 01:00:22,758
At the moment, it's not exactly enough.

955
01:00:23,641 --> 01:00:26,791
I think this is enough.

956
01:00:30,133 --> 01:00:35,258
Take your bags and leave my house, please.

957
01:00:36,175 --> 01:00:39,882
To be honest, I don't want her to know.

958
01:00:39,882 --> 01:00:42,100
She would be sad.

959
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:44,657
What are you talking about?

960
01:00:44,657 --> 01:00:46,815
Why are you showing me this attitude?

961
01:00:46,815 --> 01:00:49,774
I did this for your daughter!

962
01:00:49,774 --> 01:00:53,940
For her joy, whose else? This was her first birthday party!

963
01:00:57,683 --> 01:01:01,508
The two persons above are not blood relatives: Father and Daughter.

964
01:01:01,508 --> 01:01:03,641
No way!

965
01:01:04,233 --> 01:01:06,565
How could the result be like this?

966
01:01:06,565 --> 01:01:08,016
This is impossible.

967
01:01:08,016 --> 01:01:10,350
Why?

968
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:13,316
With a woman like you...

969
01:01:17,491 --> 01:01:22,291
I might not be a good mother,

970
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,400
but...

971
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,507
I'm trying to do what's best for her, whatever it may take.

972
01:01:27,507 --> 01:01:29,240
I just want her to have a father!

973
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,599
Aren't you just craving money?

974
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:34,682
Yes, I'm always in need of money,

975
01:01:34,682 --> 01:01:36,874
but, although I've lied to you now and then,

976
01:01:36,874 --> 01:01:39,891
I wouldn't sell my daughter!

977
01:01:43,258 --> 01:01:46,075
I would never sell my daughter.

978
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:54,700
To be honest, I really did like her.

979
01:01:56,225 --> 01:01:59,741
For the last time, how much do you want?

980
01:01:59,741 --> 01:02:02,900
This is the last time I'm going to give you money.

981
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,033
I don't need your money.

982
01:02:05,975 --> 01:02:08,432
I want the both of us to take the paternity test again.

983
01:02:08,432 --> 01:02:10,807
I want to get the results myself!

984
01:02:10,807 --> 01:02:12,825
What are you doing?

985
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:20,333
Now I understand.

986
01:02:20,808 --> 01:02:22,599
You are a doctor.

987
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:25,266
All of your colleagues work at the hospital.

988
01:02:26,116 --> 01:02:29,215
They'd help you achieve whatever you want.

989
01:02:29,215 --> 01:02:32,583
You could have changed the result! You changed it, didn't you?

990
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:35,157
You can say whatever you want,

991
01:02:35,157 --> 01:02:37,966
but don't talk about my medical etiquette!

992
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:46,432
So who else could be her father?

993
01:02:46,432 --> 01:02:49,274
- Who else could be her father?
 - I don't know.

994
01:02:49,274 --> 01:02:52,265
To be honest, I don't even want to know.

995
01:02:52,265 --> 01:02:55,400
You are her mother. You should know it.

996
01:02:57,625 --> 01:03:00,341
It's clearly written on this result.

997
01:03:01,741 --> 01:03:04,591
You don't know it at all!

998
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:10,215
You should know...

999
01:03:10,215 --> 01:03:12,699
who you slept with.

1000
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:15,190
Don't you know?

1001
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:18,775
Or are you just pretending you don't remember?

1002
01:03:22,091 --> 01:03:25,057
Let me tell you,

1003
01:03:25,057 --> 01:03:31,325
in your eyes, I might be dirty and cheap,

1004
01:03:34,383 --> 01:03:38,124
but I'm not a prostitute.

1005
01:03:39,183 --> 01:03:41,300
And even if I were prostitute...

1006
01:03:42,382 --> 01:03:46,507
I would still know who my child's father would be!

1007
01:03:46,507 --> 01:03:48,908
I would definitely know.

1008
01:03:55,016 --> 01:03:57,433
I am sorry, though.

1009
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,324
I am not her dad.

1010
01:04:00,324 --> 01:04:02,850
But this result...

1011
01:04:29,975 --> 01:04:32,141
Let's go, Mom.

1012
01:04:48,266 --> 01:04:50,466
Dad,

1013
01:04:52,491 --> 01:04:56,758
am I really not your daughter?

1014
01:05:03,408 --> 01:05:05,208
No.

1015
01:05:07,983 --> 01:05:09,983
Dad.

1016
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,500
Dad!

1017
01:06:06,275 --> 01:06:09,715
- This is for you.
 - Thank you, Dad.

1018
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,700
Dad!

1019
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:17,291
My daughter, come over to Daddy!

1020
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:19,575
I missed you so much!

1021
01:06:24,608 --> 01:06:26,365
Everything will be fine.

1022
01:06:26,365 --> 01:06:29,866
He will just stay mad at you for a few days, and then it will be over.

1023
01:06:29,866 --> 01:06:34,849
He's just like my dad, who punished me because I didn't listen to him.

1024
01:06:34,849 --> 01:06:38,191
Yet, that evening, he brought me ice-cream anyway.

1025
01:06:56,175 --> 01:07:00,040
- Are you trying to call him again?
 - I miss him so badly, Mom.

1026
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,799
- Let me call him.
 - I told you so many times,

1027
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:05,057
stop calling him! He's not your father!

1028
01:07:05,057 --> 01:07:07,099
You are lying!

1029
01:07:07,099 --> 01:07:09,690
Stop being stubborn! He is a bad person. Don't ever call him again!

1030
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:13,499
I don't want to listen to you. You're lying!

1031
01:07:13,499 --> 01:07:15,799
He is not your father! Don't you understand?

1032
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:19,415
- You're lying!
 - Am I lying?

1033
01:07:25,233 --> 01:07:29,157
Stay away from me! I hate you!

1034
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:31,857
Stay away from me!

1035
01:07:31,857 --> 01:07:34,366
I hate you!

1036
01:07:39,291 --> 01:07:41,249
I want to see my dad.

1037
01:07:41,249 --> 01:07:44,508
I miss him!

1038
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:52,091
I hate you!

1039
01:07:52,091 --> 01:07:54,975
I miss him!

1040
01:07:54,975 --> 01:07:58,191
I miss him!

1041
01:07:58,858 --> 01:08:03,483
I miss him a lot! I miss him, Mom.

1042
01:08:05,408 --> 01:08:07,208
Darling.

1043
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:10,750
Darling,

1044
01:08:12,033 --> 01:08:16,408
- what's wrong? Doesn't it taste good?
 - That's not it.

1045
01:08:16,408 --> 01:08:20,615
- Why don't you eat?
 - I will. You go ahead.

1046
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:28,391
Mun, I have a question for you.

1047
01:08:28,391 --> 01:08:32,325
Do you think me and Daddy Son look alike?

1048
01:08:33,408 --> 01:08:37,308
See, even you say "yes."

1049
01:08:37,308 --> 01:08:42,141
How come Daddy Son said I am not his daughter?

1050
01:08:43,908 --> 01:08:50,808
Anyway, forget it. You can't even talk.

1051
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:54,732
You're just like me.

1052
01:08:54,732 --> 01:08:56,599
We don't have a dad.

1053
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:59,600
He left you, too.

1054
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:04,450
Why do adults always lie?

1055
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:11,175
Why did he lie to me?

1056
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,600
I miss him so much.

1057
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:51,891
Hello... I know. I understand.

1058
01:09:51,891 --> 01:09:54,816
I am coming right now. Why are you rushing me?

1059
01:09:56,391 --> 01:09:58,091
Mom,

1060
01:09:58,091 --> 01:09:59,990
are you going to see my dad?

1061
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:01,724
Why would I be going to see him? I'm going to make some money.

1062
01:10:01,724 --> 01:10:04,765
Mom, let me go see him. I miss him.

1063
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:09,990
I repeat, don't ever mention him again.

1064
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:13,825
Mentioning him is bad luck. I didn't gamble, yet I can already see myself lose.

1065
01:10:13,825 --> 01:10:15,990
Go to sleep!

1066
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:17,990
Why is your temperature so high?

1067
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:22,482
You will feel better after sleeping, okay? I left some food for you in there, in case you're hungry.

1068
01:10:22,482 --> 01:10:25,249
Mom, come back home early, please.

1069
01:10:25,249 --> 01:10:28,632
I know. I'll be back soon. Stop nagging. Go to sleep.

1070
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:53,332
"Lucky at cards, unlucky in love" is a true saying.

1071
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:55,824
Every day should be like this.

1072
01:10:55,824 --> 01:10:59,625
Hong An, wake up. I have noodles for you,

1073
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:01,665
very tasty noodles.

1074
01:11:01,665 --> 01:11:04,116
Get up, Hong An.

1075
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:19,080
Why is your temperature so high? Hong An...

1076
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,670
Hong An,

1077
01:11:24,016 --> 01:11:27,500
why is your temperature so high, Sweetie?

1078
01:11:30,341 --> 01:11:32,741
Hong An, Hong An,

1079
01:11:32,741 --> 01:11:36,040
Hong An, Hong An!

1080
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,230
Help me!

1081
01:11:43,641 --> 01:11:45,941
Help me!

1082
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:48,608
Help!

1083
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:52,283
Help me, please!

1084
01:11:52,933 --> 01:11:55,110
Help!

1085
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:57,600
Help me, please!

1086
01:11:59,266 --> 01:12:02,716
Help my daughter, please!

1087
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:11,825
Hong An!

1088
01:12:13,508 --> 01:12:16,750
Help my daughter, please!

1089
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:21,757
Based on this result and her symptoms,

1090
01:12:21,757 --> 01:12:26,166
she might have blood cancer.

1091
01:12:27,116 --> 01:12:32,300
Before we can say for sure, we need to take some more tests.

1092
01:12:41,041 --> 01:12:42,740
Did you say blood cancer, Doctor?

1093
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,865
She is normal and healthy, Doctor.

1094
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:48,557
Your family was probably too busy to notice she had those symptoms.

1095
01:12:48,557 --> 01:12:52,583
Symptoms such as fever, persistent fatigue,

1096
01:12:52,583 --> 01:12:54,966
and skin rash.

1097
01:12:54,966 --> 01:12:58,358
She's been having them for a while now.

1098
01:13:20,283 --> 01:13:24,783
Hey, did you call her son A Tun?

1099
01:13:25,808 --> 01:13:27,699
I've tried to call him so many times,

1100
01:13:27,699 --> 01:13:31,791
but the one who picked up the phone was never him.

1101
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,790
What are you doing?

1102
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:43,949
- From morning until now...
 - A Tun?

1103
01:13:43,949 --> 01:13:45,615
How could you take money from your mother?

1104
01:13:45,615 --> 01:13:49,774
Your mother spent all day begging, for only a few dollars. Now you are going to take them. Are you even human?

1105
01:13:49,774 --> 01:13:51,920
- No.
 - So what's it to you?

1106
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,360
Hey, stop!

1107
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:57,508
- What?
 - Take it easy. Why are you fighting with the elders?

1108
01:13:57,508 --> 01:14:00,932
You dogs, it's none of your business. You'd better get away from here!

1109
01:14:00,932 --> 01:14:02,600
Come here!

1110
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,215
Catch him!

1111
01:14:04,215 --> 01:14:06,240
Stop running!

1112
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,500
Sister Thuy is  his mother.

1113
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,825
He hit her until she was like this.

1114
01:14:43,991 --> 01:14:45,791
Hey!

1115
01:14:47,141 --> 01:14:49,424
Why don't you go see your mother for the last time?

1116
01:14:49,424 --> 01:14:51,425
I am tired.

1117
01:14:54,641 --> 01:14:59,783
Are you tired? Is it acceptable for you to say that?

1118
01:15:00,433 --> 01:15:02,307
When she was still alive,

1119
01:15:02,307 --> 01:15:06,765
you forced her to become a beggar so that there was enough money for you to take drugs.

1120
01:15:06,765 --> 01:15:08,824
Now that she has passed away,

1121
01:15:08,824 --> 01:15:10,957
I ask you to come and see her for the last time.

1122
01:15:10,957 --> 01:15:13,390
Did you say you were tired?

1123
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:19,408
Did you know she kept asking to see you every single day?

1124
01:15:24,741 --> 01:15:30,440
My mom was in good health until she came here!

1125
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:35,291
Her death, it's your fault.

1126
01:15:36,658 --> 01:15:39,490
Are you here to lecture me?

1127
01:15:40,466 --> 01:15:42,800
Are you human?

1128
01:15:43,366 --> 01:15:44,566
What?

1129
01:15:44,567 --> 01:15:47,140
I'm asking you if you are human or just an animal?

1130
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:48,749
What did you say I am?

1131
01:15:48,749 --> 01:15:51,516
You're an unfilial and ungrateful child!

1132
01:15:51,516 --> 01:15:53,325
Doctor Son!

1133
01:15:53,325 --> 01:15:56,458
Doctor Hung is calling you.

1134
01:15:58,325 --> 01:16:03,732
Mind your words. Watch out for me next time!

1135
01:16:46,408 --> 01:16:49,500
Daddy, this is for you.

1136
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:55,200
- Thank you, Sweetie.
 - Don't open it yet.

1137
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,816
Whenever you miss me, you can open it.

1138
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,020
["You're My Hero" by Your Daughter]

1139
01:17:07,475 --> 01:17:10,040
My dad is going to become a super hero.

1140
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,465
He will come on a sunny day.

1141
01:17:12,465 --> 01:17:16,349
He will kill all the bad people and take back the world,

1142
01:17:16,349 --> 01:17:18,282
and protect me.

1143
01:17:18,282 --> 01:17:21,240
I used to brag about that to my friends,

1144
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,657
but till I met you,

1145
01:17:23,657 --> 01:17:26,490
I believed that this superhero was real.

1146
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:29,357
My dad was an "authentic" superhero!

1147
01:17:29,357 --> 01:17:32,090
The way you saved Chaien's dad,

1148
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:33,949
the way you help the patients,

1149
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:37,540
and the way you treat me...

1150
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:42,090
I'm truly happy to be your daughter.

1151
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:45,591
Hong An loves you very much.

1152
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:57,207
You're a bad person. Get out of here, please!

1153
01:17:57,207 --> 01:17:59,415
Dad, someone is causing disturbance here.

1154
01:17:59,415 --> 01:18:00,816
Who is it?

1155
01:18:00,817 --> 01:18:02,540
Here... Here, Dad!

1156
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:04,641
- Where?
  - Here, Dad!

1157
01:18:06,216 --> 01:18:08,307
Hey, Doctor Son!

1158
01:18:08,307 --> 01:18:10,941
- Do you know where they went?
 - Haven't you heard?

1159
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:14,774
Hong An is sick. She's been in the hospital for the past few days.

1160
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:54,358
Dad...

1161
01:19:00,266 --> 01:19:02,882
- Have some rest.
 - No, I want to sit with you, Dad.

1162
01:19:02,882 --> 01:19:04,524
- Dad!
 - All right, okay,

1163
01:19:04,524 --> 01:19:06,275
take it easy.

1164
01:19:06,275 --> 01:19:08,591
Dad,

1165
01:19:08,591 --> 01:19:11,758
I miss you so badly.

1166
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,650
I know. It's okay.

1167
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:21,491
I miss you badly.

1168
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:24,350
Be good.

1169
01:19:31,283 --> 01:19:33,658
Tell me,

1170
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:37,065
how do you feel?

1171
01:19:37,065 --> 01:19:39,675
I don't know.

1172
01:19:39,675 --> 01:19:43,525
Before, it recovered by itself.

1173
01:19:43,525 --> 01:19:47,900
But not this time.

1174
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,300
Dad...

1175
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:54,824
Daddy, promise me you will stay here with me.

1176
01:19:54,824 --> 01:19:58,974
Please don't leave me anymore. Please...

1177
01:19:58,974 --> 01:20:01,483
Please, Daddy...

1178
01:20:03,916 --> 01:20:08,450
Please, Daddy...

1179
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:10,633
I promise.

1180
01:20:22,058 --> 01:20:23,658
Daddy...

1181
01:20:23,658 --> 01:20:26,090
- Don't cry.
 - Daddy!

1182
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:27,983
- Don't cry.
 - Daddy!

1183
01:20:27,983 --> 01:20:29,999
Don't leave me alone, please.

1184
01:20:29,999 --> 01:20:33,300
It hurts so much, Daddy.

1185
01:20:34,558 --> 01:20:38,258
- Mom.
 - What are you doing here?

1186
01:20:40,433 --> 01:20:42,608
Why are you here?

1187
01:20:43,183 --> 01:20:46,357
I heard she was sick.

1188
01:20:46,357 --> 01:20:48,074
She is not your daughter.

1189
01:20:48,074 --> 01:20:51,183
You don't have any responsibility toward her.

1190
01:20:51,183 --> 01:20:54,649
I know you're still very mad at me butâ€“

1191
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,550
But what?

1192
01:20:56,550 --> 01:21:00,265
Did you come here to give her hope, and then leave again like before?

1193
01:21:00,265 --> 01:21:02,816
She's sick because she misses you.

1194
01:21:03,683 --> 01:21:06,608
What more does it take for you to be satisfied?

1195
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:15,658
Daddy!

1196
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:21,975
Daddy!

1197
01:21:21,975 --> 01:21:24,666
Daddy!

1198
01:21:25,325 --> 01:21:27,408
I am so sorry.

1199
01:21:28,791 --> 01:21:31,491
Daddy!

1200
01:21:38,908 --> 01:21:41,108
Daddy!

1201
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:45,249
Her blood cancer has come to stage two.

1202
01:21:45,249 --> 01:21:47,757
We need to start using chemotherapy.

1203
01:21:47,757 --> 01:21:51,558
I hope your bone marrow matches hers.

1204
01:21:56,841 --> 01:21:59,958
M-Mom!

1205
01:22:00,691 --> 01:22:03,675
- Mom!
 - I'm here. I'm here.

1206
01:22:03,675 --> 01:22:05,932
Mom, it hurts so much!

1207
01:22:05,932 --> 01:22:07,774
I know. I know. Hold on, okay?

1208
01:22:07,774 --> 01:22:11,091
It hurts so much!

1209
01:22:11,658 --> 01:22:13,774
I know. I know, Baby.

1210
01:22:13,774 --> 01:22:16,657
I never had this much pain in my life!

1211
01:22:16,657 --> 01:22:22,400
I know. You can't touch that. It will hurt.

1212
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:27,340
I know. Hong An, don't touch it, or else it will start bleeding.

1213
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:29,990
You have to keep it in to help you recover, okay?

1214
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:33,082
- No, I hate it!
 - I do, too.

1215
01:22:33,082 --> 01:22:34,899
I want to go home.

1216
01:22:34,899 --> 01:22:38,957
I want to go home, too. We will go home when you get better.

1217
01:22:38,957 --> 01:22:40,625
It's going to hurt, Baby.

1218
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:43,083
Daddy!

1219
01:22:44,391 --> 01:22:47,224
I miss Daddy!

1220
01:22:47,224 --> 01:22:50,349
Tell him to come here, Mom!

1221
01:22:50,349 --> 01:22:52,857
Unfortunately, your bone marrow doesn't match hers.

1222
01:22:52,857 --> 01:22:57,875
I think we need to try to find other sources.

1223
01:22:57,875 --> 01:23:02,000
All you can do is look for your relatives.

1224
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,557
Hopefully, we can find a match to help her.

1225
01:23:04,557 --> 01:23:08,366
Her condition is getting worse by the day.

1226
01:23:16,675 --> 01:23:18,575
Hong An...

1227
01:23:20,925 --> 01:23:23,291
Can you please...

1228
01:23:30,358 --> 01:23:33,041
save my daughter?

1229
01:24:02,225 --> 01:24:04,130
Hong An,

1230
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:06,070
Hong An...

1231
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:08,330
An!

1232
01:24:13,591 --> 01:24:15,941
Your "Uncle Ba" is here.

1233
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:27,875
I am here for you, all right?

1234
01:24:28,425 --> 01:24:33,258
I am here. Don't be afraid.

1235
01:24:35,566 --> 01:24:38,525
Be strong, Sweetie.

1236
01:24:38,525 --> 01:24:41,333
Get well soon.

1237
01:24:44,975 --> 01:24:51,400
I will do anything for you, all right?

1238
01:24:52,075 --> 01:24:55,775
Mun...

1239
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:59,980
- What?
 - I want...

1240
01:25:00,891 --> 01:25:04,883
Do you want me to bring Mun over?

1241
01:25:07,141 --> 01:25:09,541
I promise I will.

1242
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:12,241
I promise.

1243
01:25:32,741 --> 01:25:35,641
I promise.

1244
01:25:43,216 --> 01:25:46,175
Thank you for agreeing to the bone marrow test.

1245
01:25:46,175 --> 01:25:50,065
It's not a big deal. I do love her.

1246
01:25:51,241 --> 01:25:55,758
Hopefully, my bone marrow will match hers.

1247
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:01,550
So...

1248
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:04,066
I am so sorry...

1249
01:26:04,066 --> 01:26:06,333
about what happened on her birthday.

1250
01:26:10,866 --> 01:26:13,800
Your apology makes me feel embarrassed.

1251
01:26:14,908 --> 01:26:17,533
I should be the one to say sorry.

1252
01:26:18,316 --> 01:26:22,600
I tried to force you to take care of her, making up so many stupid things.

1253
01:26:23,366 --> 01:26:25,632
I've caused you trouble.

1254
01:26:25,632 --> 01:26:27,533
I messed up...

1255
01:26:28,191 --> 01:26:30,466
everything.

1256
01:26:30,466 --> 01:26:33,291
But everything I did...

1257
01:26:34,041 --> 01:26:36,575
was only for my daughter,

1258
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:39,891
hoping she'd get to have a dad.

1259
01:26:40,766 --> 01:26:44,116
That is her biggest wish in life.

1260
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:50,249
But during those years, why didn't you look for her "real" dad?

1261
01:26:50,249 --> 01:26:52,874
Who said I didn't?

1262
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:55,749
I've searched for him in every corner.

1263
01:26:55,749 --> 01:26:58,375
I don't know his name.

1264
01:26:58,375 --> 01:27:00,299
I don't have his address.

1265
01:27:00,299 --> 01:27:03,208
How could I find him in a sea of people?

1266
01:27:04,133 --> 01:27:06,650
There was no clue.

1267
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:11,974
You don't understand how much I struggled.

1268
01:27:11,974 --> 01:27:14,090
I was a girl with a bright future ahead,

1269
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:16,091
but then I got pregnant.

1270
01:27:20,391 --> 01:27:22,465
I got kicked out of school.

1271
01:27:22,465 --> 01:27:24,607
My dad is extremely strict.

1272
01:27:24,607 --> 01:27:27,607
It made him feel so embarrassed

1273
01:27:27,607 --> 01:27:31,458
toward his friends, relatives, and neighbors.

1274
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:34,350
He kicked me out.

1275
01:27:35,658 --> 01:27:39,341
I tried to have an abortion many times.

1276
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:49,600
[Obstetrics]

1277
01:27:52,683 --> 01:27:55,382
Who is Miss Phuong?

1278
01:27:55,382 --> 01:27:57,365
Miss Phuong?

1279
01:27:57,365 --> 01:27:59,699
I really wanted to do it, but somehow I couldn't.

1280
01:27:59,699 --> 01:28:02,140
My heart didn't give me permission.

1281
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:04,541
Now I realize...

1282
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:07,249
my daughter is just like me.

1283
01:28:07,249 --> 01:28:10,015
Everybody runs away from us,

1284
01:28:10,015 --> 01:28:12,225
dismisses us.

1285
01:28:14,666 --> 01:28:16,525
It's a pity.

1286
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:19,010
Should I have...

1287
01:28:20,825 --> 01:28:23,150
abandoned her, too?

1288
01:28:40,258 --> 01:28:42,058
Darling,

1289
01:28:42,058 --> 01:28:44,683
is there something you'd like to tell me?

1290
01:28:48,325 --> 01:28:50,900
Why are you acting strange today?

1291
01:28:59,925 --> 01:29:03,090
Otherwise, tell me next time.

1292
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:05,433
Today I am tired, too.

1293
01:29:07,016 --> 01:29:09,700
Go help Hong An.

1294
01:29:10,908 --> 01:29:13,525
She is your daughter.

1295
01:29:29,241 --> 01:29:32,333
What do you mean?

1296
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:34,133
I...

1297
01:29:36,808 --> 01:29:40,233
How do you know she is my daughter?

1298
01:29:40,233 --> 01:29:42,275
It was me.

1299
01:29:42,783 --> 01:29:46,416
I changed your paternity result.

1300
01:29:53,866 --> 01:29:57,066
Are you crazy? Why did you do that? Why?

1301
01:29:57,066 --> 01:29:58,374
Because I didn't want to lose you!

1302
01:29:58,374 --> 01:30:01,174
- You are obviously very selfish!
 - Yes,

1303
01:30:01,174 --> 01:30:04,065
I am selfish. So what? I wanted him to belong to me!

1304
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:05,799
There's nothing wrong with what I did!

1305
01:30:05,799 --> 01:30:08,424
Son and I are obviously the perfect couple.

1306
01:30:08,424 --> 01:30:10,682
He loves me and always takes care of me.

1307
01:30:10,682 --> 01:30:12,907
He would have been mine!

1308
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:16,474
Until the both of you came and messed everything up.

1309
01:30:16,474 --> 01:30:20,825
That's all your fault, both yours and your daughter's!

1310
01:30:25,158 --> 01:30:27,825
You're out of your mind!

1311
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:33,891
She is just a child.

1312
01:30:35,033 --> 01:30:41,315
If she is your daughter, you won't be selected for the study abroad program.

1313
01:30:41,315 --> 01:30:45,049
Everything you built up will be gone!

1314
01:30:45,049 --> 01:30:47,082
I wanted to wait until you came back.

1315
01:30:47,082 --> 01:30:48,882
I would have told you the truth,

1316
01:30:48,882 --> 01:30:52,150
but I hadn't expected...

1317
01:30:54,416 --> 01:30:57,741
I never would have thought An would be sick!

1318
01:31:00,233 --> 01:31:02,990
Daddy!

1319
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:05,925
She is dying.

1320
01:31:18,066 --> 01:31:22,366
I am so sorry. I was wrong!

1321
01:31:22,366 --> 01:31:24,824
If you are Father and Daughter,

1322
01:31:24,824 --> 01:31:27,615
the universe will make it happen for you to be together.

1323
01:31:27,615 --> 01:31:31,766
I can't do anything to interfere!

1324
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:38,916
She is my daughter.

1325
01:31:40,425 --> 01:31:43,725
She is my daughter.

1326
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:46,799
She is my daughter.

1327
01:31:46,799 --> 01:31:50,200
Honey, Darling,

1328
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:53,882
I know what I did was wrong. I love her, too.

1329
01:31:53,882 --> 01:31:55,840
I didn't mean to hurt her!

1330
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,441
Darling, Son, please don't leave me.

1331
01:31:59,441 --> 01:32:01,800
Honey...

1332
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,075
Son, Son!

1333
01:32:04,075 --> 01:32:06,282
Right now, her condition is getting worse.

1334
01:32:06,282 --> 01:32:08,590
We need to process the surgery immediately.

1335
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:12,282
I don't think she could live past tomorrow.

1336
01:32:12,282 --> 01:32:15,383
Please go ahead.

1337
01:32:16,075 --> 01:32:20,533
I will do anything to save my daughter.

1338
01:32:20,533 --> 01:32:22,474
Get ready.

1339
01:32:22,474 --> 01:32:26,750
We will start tomorrow morning, otherwise I think it will be too late.

1340
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,425
All right.

1341
01:32:32,991 --> 01:32:34,491
Mom!

1342
01:32:34,491 --> 01:32:36,824
Mom, you promised to get me chicken sticky rice.

1343
01:32:36,824 --> 01:32:39,575
Why did you buy beans sticky rice?

1344
01:32:40,408 --> 01:32:41,849
Son, I'm sorry.

1345
01:32:41,849 --> 01:32:45,865
I did go to your favorite shop, but they were closed.

1346
01:32:45,865 --> 01:32:48,832
I will buy it for you tomorrow.

1347
01:32:48,832 --> 01:32:51,582
No, you eat this. I won't eat it!

1348
01:32:51,582 --> 01:32:53,615
 - I want to eat chicken sticky rice!
 - Son!

1349
01:32:53,615 --> 01:32:56,183
Son, Son!

1350
01:32:57,591 --> 01:32:59,591
Mom! Mom!

1351
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:03,415
Mom, don't leave me!

1352
01:33:03,415 --> 01:33:06,075
- Mom!
 - Poor lady.

1353
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,890
Somebody, call an ambulance, please.

1354
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:12,450
She's going to be fine.

1355
01:33:14,433 --> 01:33:16,865
Be strong, Sweetie.

1356
01:33:16,865 --> 01:33:19,149
Get well soon.

1357
01:33:19,149 --> 01:33:24,775
I will do anything for you, all right?

1358
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:28,791
Mun...

1359
01:33:29,375 --> 01:33:33,275
 - What?
 - I want...

1360
01:33:34,233 --> 01:33:38,091
Do you want me to bring Mun over?

1361
01:33:40,533 --> 01:33:43,333
Mom, don't worry.

1362
01:33:43,333 --> 01:33:47,458
No matter what, I will save your grandchild.

1363
01:33:50,616 --> 01:33:54,358
- I'm begging you. Please, I will give it to you tomorrow.
 - Get away from me.

1364
01:33:54,358 --> 01:33:55,940
- No, no!
 - I promise, tomorrow.

1365
01:33:55,941 --> 01:33:57,232
- So many times...
 - Especially the dog...

1366
01:33:57,233 --> 01:34:01,016
- Bring me the money, then we'll talk.
 - Go away.

1367
01:34:05,316 --> 01:34:09,025
Hello, are you coming? Why are you not here yet?

1368
01:34:09,591 --> 01:34:10,991
All right.

1369
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:13,132
It's always you.

1370
01:34:13,132 --> 01:34:16,025
This time I'm going to kill you.

1371
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:21,524
Promise me you will keep her alive. We miss Hong An so much!

1372
01:34:21,524 --> 01:34:23,150
I know. Don't worry.

1373
01:34:23,150 --> 01:34:25,908
Don't forget, please!

1374
01:34:26,525 --> 01:34:30,500
Chaien, Seiko, come home to eat!

1375
01:34:46,608 --> 01:34:47,808
Doctor, Doctor!

1376
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:51,109
The patient went into a coma. Let's resuscitate her right away.

1377
01:36:02,516 --> 01:36:03,957
Have you tried calling Doctor Son?

1378
01:36:03,957 --> 01:36:06,999
If he's not coming, I'm afraid it will be too late.

1379
01:36:06,999 --> 01:36:09,016
Call him again, please.

1380
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:18,770
Hey!

1381
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:24,282
I want that someday, you will tell everybody in the hospital that

1382
01:36:24,282 --> 01:36:27,250
I am your daughter...

1383
01:36:30,691 --> 01:36:33,691
Are you okay? Are you all right?

1384
01:36:33,691 --> 01:36:38,890
â™«  Daddy wants to tell the world  â™«

1385
01:36:38,890 --> 01:36:40,891
â™«  Daddy's baby is the lovely  â™«

1386
01:36:40,891 --> 01:36:43,149
â™«  And awesome one  â™«

1387
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:49,070
â™«  Your baby wants to tell the world  â™«

1388
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:53,770
â™«  My Daddy is the best person  â™«

â™«  Daddy will always want to do everything to make you happy  â™«

1390
01:36:58,810 --> 01:37:03,180
â™«  I love how your eyes brighten  â™«

1391
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:11,740
â™«  Daddy, you are the pride of me  â™«

1392
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:16,810
â™«  Daddy's life was absent of laughter  â™«

1393
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:21,780
â™«  If my baby is not there in the morning  â™«

1394
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:23,620
Where are you?

1395
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:26,990
â™«  Since you came into my world  â™«

1396
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:31,670
â™«  I know what happiness is  â™«

1397
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:36,670
â™«  Daddy hug me, hold me close to your heart  â™«

1398
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:41,090
â™«  Kiss me, my baby. Do you know I love you so much?  â™«

1399
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:48,750
â™«  You are my joy  â™«

1400

â™«  Daddy, promise to protect me for the rest of my life  â™«

1401

â™«  Never leave me in the dark  â™«

1402

â™«  No matter how far apart, just need to call out  â™«

1403
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:08,340
â™«  Daddy will always be by your side  â™«

1404
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:10,450
Hong An...

1405
01:38:10,450 --> 01:38:16,150
â™«  Even if you are an adult, you will always be Daddy's baby  â™«

1406
01:38:16,150 --> 01:38:20,570
â™«  I will forever be Daddy's baby  â™«

1407
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:26,270
â™«  You will always be young and innocent in Daddy's eyes  â™«

1408
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:35,130
â™«  And Daddy will do anything for you  â™«

1409
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:38,390
My baby Hong An is awake.

1410
01:38:43,433 --> 01:38:46,258
Where do you want to go? Where are you going?

1411
01:38:46,258 --> 01:38:49,383
Where is Daddy, Mom?

1412
01:38:59,458 --> 01:39:02,275
He went for his study abroad program.

1413
01:39:03,516 --> 01:39:06,316
He told you to take care of yourself.

1414
01:39:06,316 --> 01:39:10,641
When will he get home?

1415
01:39:14,516 --> 01:39:17,316
It's an important trip.

1416
01:39:18,391 --> 01:39:20,750
When...

1417
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:25,266
He will come back when you are better.

1418
01:39:34,108 --> 01:39:36,208
It's fine.

1419
01:39:36,208 --> 01:39:39,791
I'll buy you a wig tomorrow.

1420
01:39:39,791 --> 01:39:42,715
The wig will be better than my hair. It'll be all right.

1421
01:39:42,715 --> 01:39:44,916
Yes.

1422
01:39:55,316 --> 01:39:56,716
Hong An!

1423
01:39:56,716 --> 01:39:58,625
Hong An!

1424
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:01,290
 - Hong An!
 - Daddy!

1425
01:40:07,466 --> 01:40:09,266
Daddy,

1426
01:40:11,091 --> 01:40:13,441
it's me.

1427
01:40:14,983 --> 01:40:16,983
Daddy!

1428
01:40:21,308 --> 01:40:24,670
Daddy, Daddy!

1429
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:28,824
Daddy! Daddy!

1430
01:40:31,566 --> 01:40:33,666
Daddy!

1431
01:40:33,666 --> 01:40:36,199
Dad! Daddy, Daddy!

1432
01:40:36,199 --> 01:40:38,475
What is going on?

1433
01:40:38,475 --> 01:40:40,366
Daddy...

1434
01:40:41,751 --> 01:40:44,540
Nurse, I saw my dad die!

1435
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:49,133
No way! I'll take you to see your daddy when you are better.

1436
01:40:49,133 --> 01:40:51,082
I'm doing great right now.

1437
01:40:51,082 --> 01:40:53,382
Please take me to see my dad.

1438
01:40:53,382 --> 01:40:55,350
Please...

1439
01:41:05,491 --> 01:41:07,691
Daddy!

1440
01:41:07,691 --> 01:41:09,965
What happened to you, Dad?

1441
01:41:09,965 --> 01:41:11,866
- Daddy!
 - Hong An, Hong An...

1442
01:41:11,866 --> 01:41:14,666
Hong An, Hong An, Hong An, let him rest!

1443
01:41:14,666 --> 01:41:16,965
Don't shake him like that. Let him sleep.

1444
01:41:16,965 --> 01:41:20,515
What happened to him, Mom?

1445
01:41:20,515 --> 01:41:23,749
- What happened to him, Mom?
 - Be good.

1446
01:41:23,749 --> 01:41:27,491
Wake up, Daddy!

1447
01:41:27,491 --> 01:41:30,391
Daddy, stop joking, please.

1448
01:41:30,391 --> 01:41:33,550
I don't understand you now.

1449
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:35,916
Daddy,

1450
01:41:35,916 --> 01:41:40,141
wake up, please!

1451
01:41:40,758 --> 01:41:44,633
Mom, wake him up!

1452
01:41:44,633 --> 01:41:47,265
I promise I will be a good girl.

1453
01:41:47,265 --> 01:41:50,108
Don't cry.

1454
01:41:50,108 --> 01:41:52,441
Daddy,

1455
01:41:52,983 --> 01:41:57,458
do you remember what you promised me?

1456
01:41:57,458 --> 01:42:01,432
You promised to take me out to eat,

1457
01:42:01,432 --> 01:42:06,341
to tell me stories,

1458
01:42:06,341 --> 01:42:09,650
to take me back to the countryside,

1459
01:42:09,650 --> 01:42:17,733
and to tell everyone in the hospital one day that

1460
01:42:17,733 --> 01:42:20,399
I am your daughter.

1461
01:42:20,399 --> 01:42:23,190
Don't lie to me, Daddy!

1462
01:42:23,191 --> 01:42:26,924
Wake up, please. Don't lie to me!

1463
01:42:26,924 --> 01:42:28,716
Hong An, I'm asking you, Baby.

1464
01:42:28,716 --> 01:42:33,991
Please, you are not allowed to lie!

1465
01:42:33,991 --> 01:42:37,815
- Daddy.
 - I'm asking you, Baby, don't be like this.

1466
01:42:37,815 --> 01:42:40,341
- Daddy!
 - Please, Baby...

1467
01:42:40,341 --> 01:42:42,925
Listen to me, Hong An.

1468
01:42:42,925 --> 01:42:44,600
Daddy!

1469
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:47,358
- Hong An...
 - Wake up, please!

1470
01:42:47,358 --> 01:42:50,274
Don't be like this, Daddy!

1471
01:42:50,274 --> 01:42:53,791
- Don't lie to me!
 - Listen to me, Hong An.

1472
01:42:59,283 --> 01:43:02,383
Hong An, Hong An...

1473
01:43:02,383 --> 01:43:06,150
Daddy! Daddy!

1474
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:13,858
You're not lying, right?

1475
01:43:14,916 --> 01:43:17,350
Right, Daddy?

1476
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:20,525
You're a smart girl.

1477
01:43:20,525 --> 01:43:22,965
Even if I want to, I don't dare to.

1478
01:43:22,965 --> 01:43:26,975
I knew that you were not lying.

1479
01:43:28,041 --> 01:43:32,940
Promise me not to  leave me ever again.

1480
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:44,241
Sister,

1481
01:43:50,075 --> 01:43:51,790
I am sorry.

1482
01:43:51,790 --> 01:43:54,332
Because of me, she almost...

1483
01:43:54,332 --> 01:43:57,690
It's okay. Forget it. It's over now.

1484
01:43:58,316 --> 01:44:01,740
If God wants us to circle a few times, we just do it.

1485
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:03,850
We cannot change it.

1486
01:44:03,850 --> 01:44:07,115
- Are you still angry with me?
 - Of course I am.

1487
01:44:08,041 --> 01:44:10,324
But I'm more angry with myself.

1488
01:44:10,324 --> 01:44:12,149
I was too careless to know my daughter was sick.

1489
01:44:12,149 --> 01:44:15,766
I have a part in this happening.

1490
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:20,633
I am glad that you forgive me.

1491
01:44:20,633 --> 01:44:23,583
Have you visited Son lately?

1492
01:44:25,883 --> 01:44:27,670
Why?

1493
01:44:28,583 --> 01:44:32,158
After all this, I feel like I don't deserve to be with Son.

1494
01:44:32,158 --> 01:44:35,441
He should be with someone better than me.

1495
01:44:37,091 --> 01:44:39,133
You mean...

1496
01:44:39,133 --> 01:44:41,857
I think you are.

1497
01:44:41,857 --> 01:44:44,141
And Hong An needs a family, too.

1498
01:44:44,141 --> 01:44:47,383
Oh my God, it was just a one night stand.

1499
01:44:47,383 --> 01:44:50,066
You? How many nights...

1500
01:44:51,233 --> 01:44:52,900
Maybe not...

1501
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:57,440
No, what I mean is that you had more time with Son than I did.

1502
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:59,699
You know him better than I do.

1503
01:44:59,699 --> 01:45:02,732
I feel you fit him. He will...

1504
01:45:02,732 --> 01:45:06,050
Gosh, I have no chance!

1505
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:07,583
Me neither...

1506
01:45:07,583 --> 01:45:10,457
No, open your door, and he will "jump" into you.

1507
01:45:10,457 --> 01:45:13,515
I did, but he doesn't want to come in.

1508
01:45:13,515 --> 01:45:15,616
I "expanded" my door. He won't even crawl in.

1509
01:45:15,616 --> 01:45:19,133
Oh, Lord, you two want to destroy the door!

1510
01:45:19,133 --> 01:45:23,570
From now on, I only have one person in my heart.

1511
01:45:23,570 --> 01:45:25,740
It is...

1512
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:28,691
Baby Hong An!

1513
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:34,390
- Let's go play. Let's go.
 - No, wait, Dad.

1514
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:36,990
You have to do what you promised.

1515
01:45:36,990 --> 01:45:38,591
What?

1516
01:45:38,591 --> 01:45:42,916
Remember? That promise...

1517
01:45:42,916 --> 01:45:45,200
- Right now?
 - Yes, please.

1518
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,600
Please...

1519
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:47,816
Now?

1520
01:45:50,308 --> 01:45:52,215
Don't be shy.

1521
01:45:52,215 --> 01:45:55,083
You can do it!

1522
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:00,350
I am Tung Son.

1523
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:03,049
- Hong An is my daughter.
 - Hey, of course, I knew that one.

1524
01:46:03,049 --> 01:46:04,665
She wants me to say it out loud.

1525
01:46:04,665 --> 01:46:07,724
- Speak louder.
 - I can't.

1526
01:46:07,724 --> 01:46:09,557
- Why?
 - My wound stitches would break.

1527
01:46:09,557 --> 01:46:13,050
Don't worry. This doctor will sew them back up for you.

1528
01:46:17,041 --> 01:46:18,824
I am Doctor Son!

1529
01:46:18,824 --> 01:46:21,407
Hong An is my daughter!

1530
01:46:21,407 --> 01:46:23,032
I am Doctor Son!

1531
01:46:23,032 --> 01:46:25,200
Hong An is my daughter!

1532

Thanks to our other language moderators!

1536
01:46:36,533 --> 01:46:38,915
Today I'm taking you to school. Are you happy?

1537
01:46:38,915 --> 01:46:42,166
- Yes, I am.
 - That's good.

1538
01:46:42,166 --> 01:46:44,232
The air is so fresh, Dad.

1539
01:46:44,232 --> 01:46:47,133
- So fresh!
 - Yes, fresh!

1541
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:56,740
Look at how pitiful he is.

1542
01:46:56,740 --> 01:46:59,182
Who said it was bad luck for him to hit us with his car?

1543
01:46:59,182 --> 01:47:02,108
Now he drives me to school.

1544
01:47:02,108 --> 01:47:06,024
Thinking back, thanks to that accident,

1545
01:47:06,024 --> 01:47:09,949
I have Dad and he drives me to school.

1546
01:47:09,949 --> 01:47:13,157
Do you think my dad is handsome?

1547
01:47:13,157 --> 01:47:17,775
After seeing me in school, I just know you'd all love to hit his car.

1548
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:25,683
Dad, is something wrong?

1549
01:47:26,633 --> 01:47:28,733
What the heck!

1550
01:47:29,908 --> 01:47:33,325
- What is going on?
 - I don't know.

1551
01:47:33,325 --> 01:47:36,966
The first day of going to school is not good at all.

1552
01:47:37,475 --> 01:47:39,149
We have run out of gasoline.

1553
01:47:39,149 --> 01:47:41,132
Why didn't you refill?

1554
01:47:41,132 --> 01:47:44,291
I thought your Mom had done it for me.

1555
01:47:44,891 --> 01:47:48,175
She has never had that habit.

1556
01:47:48,175 --> 01:47:50,391
But where is your car?

1557
01:47:50,391 --> 01:47:53,049
I gave it to her to refill the gasoline.

1558
01:47:53,049 --> 01:47:55,582
What? Really?

1559
01:47:55,582 --> 01:47:58,649
You are doomed.

1560
01:48:01,050 --> 01:48:02,660
You got tricked.

1561
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:04,290
Hey...

1562
01:48:04,290 --> 01:48:06,925
She's changed and she isn't like before.

1563
01:48:06,925 --> 01:48:09,974
Don't judge her that way, do you hear?

1564
01:48:09,974 --> 01:48:13,757
 - If you don't believe it, call her!
 - Don't you believe me? I'll prove it to you.

1565
01:48:13,757 --> 01:48:16,449
Let me prove it to you. I'll call her.

1566
01:48:16,449 --> 01:48:18,340
Okay, put her on speaker.

1567
01:48:18,340 --> 01:48:20,833
Your mom is calling right now.

1568
01:48:21,533 --> 01:48:24,982
- Does An's mom...
 - Hello?

1569
01:48:27,841 --> 01:48:29,657
Sorry, this phone is...

1570
01:48:29,657 --> 01:48:32,240
She pawned this phone.

1571
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:35,825
 - Has this phone been pawned?
 - Yes,

1572
01:48:35,825 --> 01:48:38,741
 - and the white car, too.
 - What?

1573
01:48:38,741 --> 01:48:43,224
 - My car has been pawned!
 - Wow, she's a "badass" this time. She even pawned the car!

1574
01:48:46,766 --> 01:48:48,699
Dad, Dad!

1575
01:48:48,699 --> 01:48:52,140
 - What are you doing?
 - I'm calling the police to arrest your mom.

1576
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:56,241
 - Police station speaking.
 - Sir, my car got stolen.

1577
01:48:57,416 --> 01:49:01,016
See, my mom never changes.

1578
01:49:01,016 --> 01:49:05,091
Only my dad always falls for her trap.

1579
01:49:06,733 --> 01:49:10,150
Que Phuong!

1580
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:18,180
[The End]
