Thomas Reddmann
Was arrested earlier today

For the murder of Bloom incorporated

Thomas Reddmann
Will be incarcerated

00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,337
It was a setup.

So, he escaped
With another patient

367
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:56,714
And used him
As dead meat'?

368

376
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:28,037
It's fine. It's just
A little splinter.

377
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,673
Mmm, yes, they start small.

378
00:36:30,738 --> 00:36:33,548
But the infection
Can spread.

379
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,417
You don't want that.

380
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,814

Right.

389
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:19,090
Now, just remove
The fingernail.

No, don’t look at them.

00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,342
[Door opens]

547
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,588
What a messy
Girl she was.

548
00:50:40,487 --> 00:50:43,195
You, uh,
You want me...

549
00:50:43,256 --> 00:50:45,896
Yes, Mr. Tucker.

550
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:50,203
Spick and span.
Spick and span.

551
00:50:54,935 --> 00:50:56,642
Okay.

552
00:50:58,538 --> 00:51:00,108
[Trembling voice]
Okay.

553
00:51:34,908 --> 00:51:36,751
This job sucks.

554
00:51:55,562 --> 00:51:58,202
Good job, Mr. Tucker.

555
00:51:58,265 --> 00:52:00,336
Most impressive.

556
00:52:02,169 --> 00:52:04,513
I'm just happy
You’re happy.

557
00:52:04,571 --> 00:52:07,677
That's the attitude.

558
00:52:07,741 --> 00:52:11,985
If only that attitude were more
Evident in your other work.

559
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:16,118
In fact, I'm afraid I have to
Express extreme dissatisfaction

560
00:52:16,183 --> 00:52:18,527
With the work of the
Group as a whole.

561
00:52:18,585 --> 00:52:22,761
A company which
Does not get results

562
00:52:22,823 --> 00:52:25,326
Cannot sustain itself.

563
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,532
And a company which
Cannot sustain itself,

564
00:52:28,595 --> 00:52:32,668
Has to start reevaluating
Its workers' positions.

565
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:38,810
It's time for
A performance review.

566
00:52:40,273 --> 00:52:42,014
Right.

567
00:52:52,652 --> 00:52:56,361
What I want is for you to
Think back on that day.

568
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,529
The day you saw me.

569
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,197
Why were you
At the building?

570
00:53:02,696 --> 00:53:06,337
I'd been out drinking
The night before.

571
00:53:06,399 --> 00:53:10,939
I was hungover and I was
Late for a job interview.

572
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,721
[Elevator bell]

573
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,223
You say I was grinning.

574
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,759
That's how I remember it.

575
00:53:21,815 --> 00:53:26,423
And then I heard
Someone screaming,

576
00:53:26,486 --> 00:53:29,057
And I realized
It was me.

577
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:35,169
I had to get a delivery to
A small publishing house.

578
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,271
I remember
Seeing this girl

579
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:42,404
Who looked?
Out of place.

580
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,644
Who I now know
As Annabelle.

581
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:51,518
And then the elevator
Doors opened.

582
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,648
[Screaming]

583
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:57,156
You looked terrified.

584
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,629
Like you were in shock.

585
00:54:01,688 --> 00:54:04,601
I'd been tracking the
Headhunter for months.

586
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,366
I was pretty sure I knew where
And when his next kill would be.

587
00:54:07,427 --> 00:54:08,906
I just didn't know
Who it'd be.

588
00:54:08,962 --> 00:54:11,670
I entered the lobby
And there you were.

589
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:13,802
I told you to put
The axe down.

590
00:54:16,036 --> 00:54:17,709
After a moment
You complied,

591
00:54:17,771 --> 00:54:20,945
So I decided to use
Non-lethal force.

592
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:23,146
I took you
Into custody.

593
00:54:23,209 --> 00:54:27,316
I did my best to have
You acquitted, Redd.

594
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,656
Rest assured of that.

595
00:54:29,716 --> 00:54:31,696
Did you really?

596
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:34,027
The prosecution's evidence,

597
00:54:34,087 --> 00:54:35,828
It was overwhelming!

598
00:54:38,992 --> 00:54:43,372
Guy Marr and the police asserted
That I decapitated Ms. Shelly Bloom

599
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,205
In the lift.
Correct?

600
00:54:45,265 --> 00:54:46,471
Correct.

601
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,308
And nobody saw
The actual killing

602
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,780
Because the lift's camera was out.
Also correct?

603
00:54:50,837 --> 00:54:52,145
Yes.

604
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:56,017
I think you missed
A key piece of evidence.

605
00:54:56,076 --> 00:54:59,216
Are you aware that the lift in
Question was custom built'?

606
00:55:00,814 --> 00:55:03,055
No.

607
00:55:03,116 --> 00:55:05,323
But you are aware
Of Miloan brand elevators?

608
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,461
This black line

609
00:55:13,526 --> 00:55:17,064
Is the height of the
Miloan brand elevator.

610
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:23,207
But this red line
Is the highest point

611
00:55:23,269 --> 00:55:26,216
In the custom-built
Elevator.

612
00:55:26,272 --> 00:55:28,274
Our elevator.

613
00:55:29,609 --> 00:55:31,555
Okay.

614
00:55:31,611 --> 00:55:36,890
Do you know how much pressure one
Has to use to decapitate a person?

615
00:55:38,151 --> 00:55:40,563
No. No, I don't.

616
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:46,369
Because when
The masked murderer

617
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,269
Decapitated
Ms. Shelly Bloom,

618
00:55:48,328 --> 00:55:51,332
The prosecution asserted
That he used his axe.

619
00:55:51,398 --> 00:55:55,369
Like a guillotine to sever
Skin, sinew and bone

620
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:59,349
By using an extraordinary
Amount of force.

621
00:55:59,406 --> 00:56:01,443
Like this.

622
00:56:01,508 --> 00:56:03,351
No, no, no,
Redd, please.

623
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:07,324
[Shouting]

624
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:26,266
[Hinges squeak]

625
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,663
[Door closes]

626
00:56:52,726 --> 00:56:55,104
Thank God.

627
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,936
What happened in there'?

628
00:56:59,132 --> 00:57:01,134
Are you okay'?

629
00:57:33,633 --> 00:57:35,112
Who's Peter Bava?

630
00:57:35,168 --> 00:57:36,772
What?

631
00:57:36,836 --> 00:57:38,611
There's an
Inconsistency here.

632
00:57:38,671 --> 00:57:40,776
Peter Bava.

633
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,049
He's listed as an alibi witness but
His statement was never taken.

634
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:46,021
Maybe it got lost.

635
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,026
That's what I thought, too, but the
Statement is listed as evidence

636
00:57:49,082 --> 00:57:50,959
And the documents been removed. 

637
00:57:51,017 --> 00:57:53,327
Edward.

638
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,127
Edward.

639
00:57:55,188 --> 00:57:57,190
Do you know?
Peter Bava'?

640
00:58:01,961 --> 00:58:04,908
Hang on, this is. This is your
Signature at the bottom, right'?

641
00:58:08,701 --> 00:58:10,476
Edward.

642
00:58:10,537 --> 00:58:11,982
Is that your signature?

643
00:58:16,009 --> 00:58:18,250
It looks like it, but.

644
00:58:18,311 --> 00:58:20,018
Well, it either is
Or it isn't.

645
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,821
What are you hiding?
Nothing.

646
00:58:24,517 --> 00:58:26,360
This was all
Along time ago.

647
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:29,923
Do you know how many cases?
I've worked since then'?

648
00:58:29,989 --> 00:58:32,560
Why should I care about?
Any other case but this'?

649
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:36,095
(Rudy) Redd could’nt have
Killed Shelly Bloom.

650
00:58:36,162 --> 00:58:37,835
What'?

651
00:58:37,897 --> 00:58:40,002
No, no, no,
I'm not saying that.

652
00:58:40,066 --> 00:58:43,206
I just. I wanna know
Who Peter Bava is.

653
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,579
No.

654
00:58:45,638 --> 00:58:47,743
He didn't have enough
Room to swing the axe.

655
00:58:54,314 --> 00:58:56,294
(Annabelle)
Edward.

656
00:58:56,349 --> 00:58:57,760
What are you hiding?

657
00:59:03,389 --> 00:59:07,098
After I arrested
Thomas Reddmann,

658
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,232
The media
Was all over me.

659
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:13,072
Detective Crandell
Catches the headhunter.

660
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:16,636
But Reddmann
Was so calm.

661
00:59:16,703 --> 00:59:19,206
He had total faith
In the system.

662
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,213
He had weak alibis
For all the other murders.

663
00:59:23,276 --> 00:59:25,017
He was always at work.

664
00:59:25,078 --> 00:59:27,991
And when he wasn't in the office,
He was nowhere he could prove.

665
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:32,223
But the second
Killing, he.

666
00:59:34,454 --> 00:59:36,400
He had an alibi
For the second.

667
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:41,805
The headhunter killing
Of October 14th.

668
00:59:41,861 --> 00:59:44,102
Redd was firing
An employee

669
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:46,370
For having
A bad attitude.

670
00:59:46,432 --> 00:59:51,313
That employee was a man by
The name of...Peter Bava.

671
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,948
I asked him
If he was certain

672
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,545
That the date he was
Fired on was the 14th.

673
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:58,680
And he said,

674
00:59:58,745 --> 01:00:00,725
Yeah, man,
Check it out.

675
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:04,091
He gave me a letter
Of termination.

676
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:07,620
Seriously.
I framed it.

677
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,133
The day they fired me
From this place,

678
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,465
That was the greatest
Day of my life.

679
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:17,338
Come on, Peter.
That guy was fucked up.

680
01:00:17,397 --> 01:00:19,377
Any detective that
Works the streets

681
01:00:19,432 --> 01:00:22,606
Knows that if you've got 80% percent of
The evidence, you can find the other 20%.

682
01:00:22,669 --> 01:00:25,309
Well, I had 80% of the evidence.
More, even.

683
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:30,047
I kept telling myself we had the
Right guy until Peter Bava.

684
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:34,081
But I've always
Known there's

685
01:00:34,147 --> 01:00:37,424
A special place in hell
For me for what I did.

686
01:00:37,483 --> 01:00:40,521
Then I got shot on the job
And I ended up in this chair.

687
01:00:40,586 --> 01:00:43,533
It felt like
I'd paid the price.

688
01:00:43,589 --> 01:00:46,695
So, we're all here
Because of you.

689
01:00:46,759 --> 01:00:48,568
(William) Because you
Are incompetent

690
01:00:48,628 --> 01:00:50,073
Or just because
You’re corrupt?

691
01:00:50,129 --> 01:00:52,473
Oh, now you're
Calling me corrupt?

692
01:00:52,532 --> 01:00:54,341
You withheld evidence.

693
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,142
I'm no expert, but that sounds
An awful lot like corruption.

694
01:00:57,203 --> 01:00:59,843
It was just
One witness.

695
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,477
I only withheld
One witness.

696
01:01:02,542 --> 01:01:04,579
It's all so fucking
Easy to judge now.

697
01:01:04,644 --> 01:01:07,022
But At the time there was
So much pressure on me,

698
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,390
I had to make
An arrest.

699
01:01:12,685 --> 01:01:15,291
Oh, fuck me.

700
01:01:20,626 --> 01:01:22,469
Edward.

701
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,039
Is there something
You want to tell me'?

702
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,038
Redd.

703
01:01:32,505 --> 01:01:34,576
We can talk
About this.

704
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,120
With this new evidence,
I could get you a retrial.

705
01:01:37,176 --> 01:01:40,350
But it's not
New evidence, is it'?

706
01:01:40,413 --> 01:01:45,089
It's evidence which was
Deliberately withheld by you.

707
01:01:45,151 --> 01:01:47,631
Please.

708
01:01:47,687 --> 01:01:49,564
Oh. Ah!

709
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:51,124
Oh!

710
01:02:01,868 --> 01:02:03,472
[Cutting sound]

711
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:13,321
What is this'?

712
01:02:13,379 --> 01:02:15,450
What are you doing?

713
01:02:15,515 --> 01:02:17,256
Shh.

714
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:18,852
[Panting]

715
01:02:20,753 --> 01:02:23,962
Oh, is that--

716
01:02:24,023 --> 01:02:26,094
Is that my blood?

717
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,571
Shh.

718
01:02:28,628 --> 01:02:31,234
Is that my blood?

719
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,975
[Panting]

720
01:02:39,105 --> 01:02:40,880
Is that my leg'?

721
01:02:42,275 --> 01:02:45,313
Is that my fucking leg'?

722
01:02:45,378 --> 01:02:49,292
[Edward shouting]

723
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:52,886
