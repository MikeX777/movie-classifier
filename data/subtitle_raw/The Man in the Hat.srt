2
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:11,501
You know Alain, his twin brother

3
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:14,334
He was always kind to me

4
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:16,793
Well we flirted a bit

5
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,085
It's normal, no?

6
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,793
What could I do?

7
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,793
Jean-Claude had been dead
more than a year

8
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:26,918
You can't wait forever

9
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:30,668
So we became lovers

10
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,585
It wasn't bad at all

11
00:08:33,543 --> 00:08:36,375
Even better, amazing

12
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,418
I know, it was his brother

13
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,251
but at last I could breathe

14
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:44,251
Things were better

15
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:47,918
apart from his dog, Kremone

16
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,543
She was his true love

17
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:55,002
She was so angry that she would
lie on the bed between us

18
00:08:55,043 --> 00:08:56,626
to stop Alain touching me

19
00:08:56,877 --> 00:08:59,209
Then one day she disappeared

20
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:01,960
We looked everywhere

21
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,543
Then the gravedigger phoned and said
he'd found her at the cemetery

22
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:08,418
She'd spent the whole day
sitting on his grave

23
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:17,626
What's incredible

24
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:21,501
during the night she decided
to dig up his bones

25
00:09:22,418 --> 00:09:23,668
The gravedigger returned at dawn

26
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:28,543
She'd dug up the earth

27
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:32,543
Nothing, there was just an empty hole

28
00:09:33,002 --> 00:09:34,002
not even a coffin!

29
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,877
The police came

30
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:40,251
I insisted they re-open the case

31
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:44,002
They finally told me
Jean-Claude was not dead

32
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,918
He'd fled the country

33
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,835
Something with the mafia

34
00:09:47,376 --> 00:09:48,668
He’d grassed to the police

35
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:51,668
Puff, vanished

36
00:09:57,293 --> 00:09:58,209
He lives in Algeria

37
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:01,918
can't come back or

38
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:03,626
he'd be killed

39
00:10:05,002 --> 00:10:07,209
He'd done it for me, for all of us

40
00:10:08,043 --> 00:10:12,710
I insisted I had to see him or else

41
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,877
I'd reveal everything

42
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:16,084
I loaded the car

43
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:20,293
Kremone beside me, motionless, expectant

44
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:24,626
I don't understand what goes on
in the head of that poodle

45
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:27,084
One evening I was in a cafe

46
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,626
Jean-Claude arrived

47
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:31,293
He shouted

48
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:34,334
“my wife with my brother
how is it possible?!”

49
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:41,043
He said he couldn't live
without Kremone

50
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:46,835
Kremone looking back
over his shoulder...

51
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:49,376
...in triumph!

52
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,543
She's beautiful but sad

53
00:32:26,085 --> 00:32:28,001
What about my ceiling?

54
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:42,168
My omelette?

55
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:48,626
Seeing you sitting there
makes me think of my cousin

56
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:52,668
She was mad about chickens

57
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:57,793
I don't remember where
she was living then

58
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:01,085
but she’d seen an advert

59
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,501
in a newspaper

60
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:06,001
for 10 chickens and an enormous coop

61
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:11,418
I went to the farm, mud everywhere

62
00:36:15,835 --> 00:36:17,876
Old buildings but no people

63
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:22,709
I went to look for the farmer

64
00:36:24,168 --> 00:36:25,960
There were animals everywhere...

65
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,835
…but nobody

66
00:36:31,126 --> 00:36:33,793
So I decided to leave

67
00:36:34,377 --> 00:36:39,543
I was going back to my van
when I heard a strange noise

68
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,626
And there in the ditch

69
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:44,709
stuck in the mud was an old man

70
00:36:45,168 --> 00:36:49,835
Unable to get out,
his legs stuck in the mud

71
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,377
I couldn't pull him out on my own

72
00:36:54,793 --> 00:36:57,085
He asked me to get him a coffee

73
00:36:58,876 --> 00:37:00,459
Do you want some more coffee?

74
00:37:07,918 --> 00:37:12,168
"Reheat the pot on the stove" he said

75
00:37:14,918 --> 00:37:17,377
I went to the kitchen, lit the gas...

76
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:20,377
...and I heard footsteps

77
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,751
A man came into the kitchen

78
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:30,626
He was handsome. Very handsome

79
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:34,210
You can't imagine how handsome!

80
00:37:38,709 --> 00:37:40,043
He told me his dream

81
00:37:40,377 --> 00:37:42,293
he was stuck in a ditch

82
00:37:42,918 --> 00:37:45,127
covered in mud - a horrible nightmare

83
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:47,751
He woke when he heard me come in

84
00:37:49,793 --> 00:37:51,626
We went out to the ditch...

85
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:55,418
...there was no one there!

86
00:37:56,168 --> 00:37:57,835
The old man had gone

87
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,835
It was as if I had
entered into his dream

88
00:38:10,793 --> 00:38:12,751
So we drank the coffee

89
00:38:13,127 --> 00:38:15,418
I stayed for 3 days

90
00:38:17,751 --> 00:38:19,418
After a few weeks we got married

91
00:38:20,085 --> 00:38:22,001
We were very happy...

92
00:38:22,918 --> 00:38:25,876
...well, I think we were

93
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:30,584
I never got the chickens
Nor him - he disappeared

94
00:38:36,252 --> 00:38:40,127
I'm now alone
you have your chicken

95
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,918
Don't do that again, what you did last night

96
00:38:49,085 --> 00:38:51,376
Don't do that to me

97
00:51:10,585 --> 00:51:15,377
Listen now to The Song of Forgotten Cars

98
00:52:02,377 --> 00:52:05,043
And now, the Song of Forgotten Cigarettes

99
01:07:05,543 --> 01:07:09,001
Ladies and gentlemen,
our laureate, Professor...

100
01:07:09,043 --> 01:07:10,043
...Schmetterling

101
01:07:16,585 --> 01:07:20,502
Before we hear from our
distinguished guest

102
01:07:20,834 --> 01:07:25,210
I would like us to reflect
on his discoveries

103
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:30,751
while listening to the Saint Felix ensemble

104
01:08:34,084 --> 01:08:37,960
It gives us great pleasure to award him

105
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,708
the Ewaldiana Prize

106
01:08:40,252 --> 01:08:43,252
named after one of the famous founders

107
01:08:43,668 --> 01:08:46,085
of the science of crystallography

108
01:20:21,835 --> 01:20:23,793
I remember one day with my uncle

109
01:20:25,543 --> 01:20:27,918
he said he was going to climb this rock

110
01:20:28,959 --> 01:20:32,834
I said you're mad - it's too high
It's dangerous

111
01:20:35,585 --> 01:20:36,918
But he was too confident

112
01:20:38,335 --> 01:20:39,376
He climbed it

113
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,293
he jumped

114
01:20:43,043 --> 01:20:44,460
and I never saw my uncle again

115
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:50,752
The police put a net across the river

116
01:20:51,668 --> 01:20:53,335
A thick fog came down

117
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:57,251
They never found him

118
01:21:03,043 --> 01:21:06,710
We went to eat at Gaspard's
as it was a Sunday

119
01:21:09,834 --> 01:21:11,543
It was a sad meal

120
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:18,918
No grandfather

121
01:21:21,959 --> 01:21:24,251
and now no uncle

122
01:21:34,793 --> 01:21:35,959
I'm tired

123
01:21:39,251 --> 01:21:40,251
Good night

124
01:22:57,793 --> 01:23:03,043
Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to
the 19th fête of St.Julien en Clop

125
01:23:04,293 --> 01:23:07,210
Between us, I'd love a smoke

126
01:23:07,251 --> 01:23:08,210
Between us, I'd love a smoke

127
01:23:08,251 --> 01:23:11,543
but my doctor has forbidden me
after the death of his dog

128
01:23:13,627 --> 01:23:16,085
I'd like to thank
Mr & Mrs Fanonvilliers

129
01:23:16,502 --> 01:23:19,293
for the mutton they supply for the grill

130
01:23:19,709 --> 01:23:21,001
They know nothing about sheep

131
01:23:21,793 --> 01:23:27,335
The mutton reminds us of
our beautiful countryside

132
01:23:30,126 --> 01:23:31,418
Apologies...

133
01:23:32,168 --> 01:23:33,668
...I have terrible stomach cramps...

134
01:23:34,543 --> 01:23:36,834
...I think it's the oysters
prepared by my husband

135
01:23:39,793 --> 01:23:42,168
I'd like to thank Mrs Leboitier

136
01:23:42,959 --> 01:23:45,502
for her exceptional tomatoes

137
01:23:46,043 --> 01:23:48,251
whose flavour is beyond our wildest dreams

138
01:23:49,834 --> 01:23:53,793
And the wines supplied by Gaston Leduc

139
01:23:55,377 --> 01:23:57,043
who despite his great age

140
01:23:57,418 --> 01:24:00,085
still adds to the general drunkenness

141
01:24:04,043 --> 01:24:06,793
We are all here together
faced with an uncertain future

142
01:24:07,377 --> 01:24:09,001
rotten with uncertainty

143
01:24:09,585 --> 01:24:14,585
defenceless against a world
in perpetual evolution

144
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:18,001
towards the abyss…

145
01:24:19,335 --> 01:24:20,418
…of oblivion

146
01:24:22,585 --> 01:24:26,126
I leave you amongst these trees,
these stones

147
01:24:27,168 --> 01:24:28,502
these bottles, and

148
01:24:29,126 --> 01:24:31,126
your favourite chicken race!
