to look the same.

doing science fiction...

be different? How's it gonna be new?

...what can happen to the human body when
things go wrong, genetically speaking.

in the first Alien...

15
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,057
...is just a tiny tributary
of what's actually going on.

which opened up the door...

upset them a little bit or take that risk.

SPAIHTS: The idea of returning to Alien, and of
particularly bringing Ridley back to Alien...

29
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,387
...had been floating around for years.

30

...I was not even ostensibly going
to a meeting about the project.

to talk generally about writing projects.

across a desk, uh, without warning.

"We've thought about going back
to Alien."

36
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,118
And I said, "Alien? Back--? Well...."

37
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,287
And I sort of walked through
the films in my head...

38
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,332
...and by the time you get done
with the four orthodox Alien movies...

39
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,751

the mythology is so dense...

of how to write the next one...

41
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,006
...where on earth you'd go from there.
And they said:

42
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,551
"Oh, we feel the same way.
We'd go back."

43
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,929
SCOTT: There's one question no one asked
in all four movies...

44
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,806
...much to my amazement.

45
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,599
I'm surprised no one said:

46
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:08,938
"Who's the big guy in the seat
that became known as the space jockey?"

47
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,608
I don't know who gave it that name,
but somebody called it a space jockey.

48
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:13,776
It's not in the film.

49
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:18,281
This guy sitting in his chair
in the middle of this craft...

50
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,910
...clearly a craft, was a big question.
Who was that?

51
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,495
I'd never thought about it before...

52
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,081
...but l discovered instantly
that I had all these opinions...

53
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,792
...and I started mouthing off in the room.
I got very opinionated.

54

"Well, you'd have to go back to
the ship wreck from which it all sprang.

the space jockey...

56
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:42,805
...the dead giant in the chair
with an elephantine proboscis, rib cage."

57
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,641
What do you do if you're gonna go
make a movie about that guy...

58
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,269
...and his comrades
on some big starship?

59
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,730
They look ridiculous.
They'll be unintentionally funny.

60
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,940
We won't relate to them,
because they're not people.

61
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,192
They're gonna speak some language
we don't understand.

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,485
How do you do it?

63
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:01,699
And it seemed very plain to me
that the only way...

64
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:05,161
...you could go dive into the story
of the space jockeys...

65
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,331
...is if their story was ultimately ours.

66
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,416
If their story lead back to us.

67
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:14,045
They needed to be intrinsically involved
in the human story...

68
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,298
...in human history
and, l thought, in our evolution.

69
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,551
LlNDELOF:
I first heard about the fact...

70
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,596
...that Ridley was considering
coming back to sci-fi...

71
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,599
...and that he was gonna do
maybe an Alien prequel.

72
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,686
And I think l was hearing the same thing
that everybody else was, which is...

73
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:34,023
...he was very interested
in this massive corpse...

74
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,817
...that was sitting in a chair
in the beginning of Alien...

75
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,279
...and sort of telling a story
from the point of view of:

76
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,866
"Okay, well, what was that? And
how does that plug into the mythology?"

77
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,661
And I think, you know, sort of every bone
in my fan-boy body...

78
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,206
...was just sort of vibrating.
Oh, my God, I can't wait to see that.

79
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,708
SCOTT:
Then that evolved.

80
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:56,253
And from that evolution,
I pitched to Fox and Fox said:

81
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,714
"Wow, that's a really interesting idea."

82
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:03,678
And that's where we started to evolve
into previsitation.

83
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,930
Have we been previsited before?

84
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:10,184
And the more you climb into it,
the more you realize it's entirely logical.

85
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,397
SPAIHTS: The notion that our gods
really came not from the heavens...

86
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,273
...but from the stars, from other worlds.

87
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,900
And, you know, there's no shortage...

88
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,528
...obviously, of this kind
of theorizing and mythologizing...

89
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:24,865
...from relatively serious scholarship
to wild conspiracy theories...

90
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,910
...saying that the pyramids,
the lnca temples...

91
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,746
...the Greek astronomers,
all of this ancient wisdom...

92
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,000
...these old accomplishments were
assisted by powers from beyond the stars...

93
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,044
...that we, ourselves,
were shaped by something else.

94
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:42,091
SCOTT: lt's entirely illogical to believe
that we haven't been visited before.

95
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,428
Because there's two points of arrogance
attached to that idea.

96
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,347
One is to believe that we're it
in this entire galaxy.

97
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,974
There has to be more.

98
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,686
Not humanoids, necessarily,
but more other life forms.

99
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,273
And it's arrogant for us to believe
that we are superlative...

100
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,942
...as opposed to we may be minor.

101
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,028
Next day,
the head of Ridley's company called...

102
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,281
...asked me to write that down for him
because he wanted to show it to Ridley.

103
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,576
You're not supposed to write anything
down as a screenwriter without a contract.

104
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,870
I immediately wrote it down
and they sent it to Ridley.

105
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,290
They told me it would only go to Ridley,
and it immediately shot into the studio...

106
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,250
...and up the ladder
to the top of the studio.

107
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,879
And within 1 0 days, it was sitting
in front of the co-chairs of Fox...

108
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,714
...and we were locking it down.

109
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:27,053
And after that, I worked as fast and
as hard as I've ever worked on anything.

110
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,847
Ridley and l and Michael Costigan
and Michael Ellenberg...

111
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,640
...we just spent months in the room...

112
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,101
...hashing out story,
going around draft after draft...

113
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,228
...and finding our way to the story.

114
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:39,982
ELLENBERG: Who would fly a spaceship
filled with these horrible creatures on it?

115
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,652
What would possess anyone to do that,
human or alien?

116
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,322
And that's the real question
he was always sort of curious about.

117
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,990
What would motivate someone
to do that?

118
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,785
And so the whole premise
from the beginning...

119
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,329
...and what then became,
and now is Prometheus...

120
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,664
...that idea still is what the movie is.

121
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,627
And there's something very pure and special
about the development of this...

122
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,838
...because it became about,
who would make monsters?

123
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:07,009
SPAIHTS: We began with Giger's monster.
We began with the beast.

124
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:11,514
That's the core of the franchise,
it's the core monster.

125
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,309
As a new frontier to explore,
we looked at these giants...

126
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,311
...these Engineers, as I called them.

127
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,772
The aliens who had shaped us,
the old gods.

128
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,441
SCOTT: l came up with saying,
"What happens if these guys exist?

129
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,610
And if they do exist, who were they?"

130
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:29,031
And I always figured that pilot
was flying a battleship.

131
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,035
And the battleship was a carrier
of deadly objects.

132
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,664
The deadly objects were the eggs,
and the eggs were the DNA...

133
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:41,293
...that would be carried out to destroy,
would be used to destroy.

134
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,878
What would they be destroying?

135
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,799
SPAIHTS: The farther we pushed
into the development of the story...

136
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,509
...the bigger the Engineers got...

137
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:52,221
...and the more marginalized
the original Alien monster became...

138
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,224
...until that monster became
a kind of feature or grace note...

139
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,811
...in a larger story that was
about humanity meeting its makers.

140
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,189
Humanity confronting the forces
that had created it...

141
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,233
...and maybe not liking them that much.

142
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,569
Spaihts did a lot of the footslog...

143
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,697
...and a lot of the stuff around the table
with me going:

144
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,700
"Yeah, but what about this
and what about that?"

145
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,953
And this will be Holloway,
"Are you seeing this?"

146
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,329
-Coming down the ramp.
-Yep.

147
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,623
That's when you go
to the Magellan bridge.

148
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,127
If there's six people,
they're gonna have six helmets.

149
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,046
All got screens on them, all moving.

150
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:30,676
A very good example of their race,
so he's kind of like perfection.

151
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,052
MAN: Yeah.
-All right.

152
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,181
Why would you wanna find out
about who these people are...

153
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,891
...and who made this
and who made what?

154
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:41,103
SCOTT: l tend to lob in kind of little
milestones in the story saying:

155
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,688
"There's this and this and this.

156
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,108
And when it rams it,
guess what, it doesn't destroy it.

157
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,776
It comes down, bounces."

158
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,487
SCOTT: lt bowls it,
so it goes down, hits the ground...

159
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,949
...starts to roll like a Frisbee
across the landscape.

160
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,367
SCOTT:
And then rolls after them.

161
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,871
I come up with those ridiculously
large ideas...

162
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,249
...because mainly I think
I can pull that off.

163
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,793
Then it's how do you organically
roll those into it?

164
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,672
SPAIHTS: He spitballs freely
and creatively all the time.

165
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,300
And always visually.
He's always sketching and drawing.

166
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,969
So that iterative process
had been underway for months.

167
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,971
We would sit and talk
and he would draw things.

168
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,641
And sometimes just stuff
he was making up off the cuff.

169
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,478
And often things ruinous to the story
that I'd written for that week.

170
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,064
I'd bring in pages
and he would kick my sand castle down.

171
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,316
"What if this was happening?
What if there was a...?

172
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:31,153
What do they call that thing where
they model a solar system, like an orrery?"

173
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,490
He's like, "What if there was an orrery?"
I'm like, "What would that look like?"

174
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,201
He'd start sketching
and then I have to figure out what that is...

175
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,411
...what its meaning will be,
what role it will play.

176
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,039
And so l throw my pages away
and go and write new pages.

177
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,417
This is an early draft of the script...

178
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,920
...which l wrote and rewrote
and handed in again and again.

179
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:52,049
And this one is one that's been marked up
by Ridley himself.

180
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:55,344
And in the early going,
you can see the fine detail...

181
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,221
...on which he offered feedback...

182
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,684
...and had strong opinions
about individual images, individual words...

183
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,811
...shadows and light, everything.

184
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:07,231
And I would go through
and sort of implement his notes.

185
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,402
And the highlighting is me telling myself
I've done the work l need to do.

186
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,529
So we got the side notes.
The complimentary ones:

187
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,448
"Better, this is great. But watch out.
Don't get too much like this."

188
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:21,203
Um, so you get notes as general as, "Come on,
do better than this, be more mysterious."

189
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:25,374
And notes as specific as,
"l hate this word. Use another word."

190
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:31,672
MAX: Conceptually, l think the first draft
that I read had a lot of potential.

191
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,135
And was stimulating visually to an extent
that opened up the universe...

192
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:40,889
...that I had always seen
as a claustrophobic interior movie...

193
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,892
...suddenly became
much more involved...

194
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,273
...with the exterior landscape
and exploration of it.

195
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,941
And that was very interesting.

196
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,403
And also suggesting
what the civilization...

197
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:59,241
...that was behind the encounter
in the first movie might have been.

198
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:05,331
SPAIHTS: Once the story got
about four drafts in, we started staffing up.

199
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,543
And Arthur Max came aboard
as our production designer and really--

200
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:10,836
And artists under him.

201
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,506
--and really began to push
the design of the film.

202
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:20,304
MAX: lt's very difficult to build a world
of science fiction...

203
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:25,434
...when you have only a static object
and a room to begin with.

204
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,439
SPAIHTS: I would literally come in
and write some new pages...

205
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,441
...come in and talk to people about them.

206
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,777
Ridley would go home
and I'd go down to the art room...

207
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,404
...and hang out
with Arthur and his artists.

208
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,616
And we'd sip a glass of wine
and talk about the monsters...

209
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:44,119
...and what they ought to be like
and how we think the scene really looks.

210
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,122
And I would go home and come back in
at 9:30 the next morning...

211
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,084
...and there would be paintings
this wide on the wall...

212
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,002
...of the scene I wrote the day before.

213
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,505
ELLENBERG: That group then started
in a very intimate way...

214
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,549
...that was really, l think,
enriching for Ridley.

215
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,469
He took the process that he applies
in all of his movies...

216
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,346
...in these kind of big design movies...

217
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,641
...he was able to take that process
and apply it to a world of science fiction.

218
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,353
The concept work on this movie
was sort of its own script work.

219
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,731
You know, and that was script work taking
place alongside the actual script work.

220
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,277
Often l'd walk into that room of artists
and I would see Ridley's footprints.

221
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,154
There would be Post-it notes
and guys saying:

222
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,865
"That's gotta come down.
Ridley wants this head shaped like that.

223
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,993
And this needs to be whiter,
and that needs to be desexualized...

224
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,496
...and this needs to be darker
and more haunted looking."

225
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,666
And artists would be tearing stuff up
because Ridley had been through...

226
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:34,169
...and reinventing it with his vision
stamped on it.

227
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,880
And then I would see that vision
and see where Ridley was going...

228
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,466
...and carry that home
when l wrote my new pages.

229
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:43,137
And at a flick they can go away and
there'd just be a plastic window...

230
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,390
-...which will come back up if you want it.
-Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Yup.

231
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,267
Screens would probably be
just that simple.

232
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,978
-Yeah.
SPAIHTS: In the first drafts of the film...

233
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:55,315
...where the monsters and the monstrous
complications that our heroes ran into...

234
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,569
...were much more on the model
of the classic Alien monster.

235
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,489
Eggs, facehuggers,
impregnation, chest-bursting.

236
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,701
The entire complex of the Engineers
that you'll see in the film...

237
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:09,872
...the pyramidal temple, the underground
catacombs, the huge caverns...

238
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,165
...those weren't there yet.

239
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,501
In the very first conceptualization
of the film...

240
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,337
...the exploratory ship made a search,
found a beacon...

241
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:21,550
...and set down beside what would
ultimately prove to be the shipwreck...

242
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:25,012
...the derelict from the first Alien film,
the crescent-shaped ship.

243
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,265
In exploring that ship,
our explorers got into trouble...

244
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,435
...and as they began to meet and find
the remains of the Engineers...

245
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,896
...and ultimately a living Engineer
whom they revive...

246
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,648
...they were tangling with menaces
along the way...

247
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:41,570
...which were recognizable ancestors
of the beast, the demon from Alien.

248
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,406
What l'm trying to do is reinvent
the facehugger.

249
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,616
-Right.
-Okay?

250
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,203
In the early phases, the project
was actually called Alien: Prequel.

251
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,081
It was an early development.
We didn't know, um, what it was gonna be.

252
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,585
We had parts of the script
that we had read, you know, early on.

253
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,756
And there were chest-bursters.
There were facehugger-type creatures.

254
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:05,052
There were things that were more directly--
You could correlate to Alien.

255
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,095
I had done paintings of a creature...

256
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,307
...that was gonna come out
of one of the characters' chest.

257
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,101
You were gonna see these tentacles
poking out.

258
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,771
And then it would pull itself--
It would open up the rib cage...

259
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,690
...and actually release itself
through the person.

260
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,859
But, you know, Ridley felt
it was too on-the-nose...

261
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,861
...and he kind of wanted to depart
from that.

262
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,156
He wanted to do things
that were more subtle, but scarier...

263
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,742
...and not as on-the-nose
as the original Alien.

264
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,037
SCOTT: Those are the things
that are decided around a table.

265
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,291
And then off that, all the rich stew...

266
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,210
...Lindelof comes in and goes:

267
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:42,965
"Ah, I really like the script,
but we could do this, this and this."

268
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:47,844
And so Lindelof, foom, carves through it
and suddenly I've got a three-act piece.

269
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:52,599
Three-act selling tool
that I can make into a three-act film.

270
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,769
LlNDELOF: What if the sequel to this movie
was not Alien?

271
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,814
But it was an entirely different movie
that started running parallel...

272
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,149
..to Alien, Aliens or whatever?

273
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:06,196
So that while this would certainly
take place in the Alien universe...

274
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,907
...and there would be all the bells
and whistles...

275
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,369
...of what we've come to expect
from what Ridley originally did...

276
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,871
...um, in terms of the tone of it,
the way that it looked...

277
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,666
...but also in terms of
how hypersleep works.

278
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:21,086
So maybe it's not a prequel at all, maybe
it's an original science-fiction movie...

279
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,381
...that sort of trades in the same stock,
but really focuses on the story.

280
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:28,719
That being said, all the things that
I loved about Jon's work...

281
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:33,515
...was that he seemed very interested
in this idea of the Engineers.

282
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,684
I think frankly
that he was brought aboard...

283
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:40,272
...because, uh, at the time
that I was working on that script...

284
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,857
...I had never had a movie produced.

285
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,152
And in the view
of a studio head, untested.

286
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,154
It happened when we were
in the homestretch.

287
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,991
Like, we think we're ready to go, um,
and the studio had two thoughts.

288
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,495
They were like, "Let's dial back the Alien
monsters and lean more on the Engineers."

289
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,914
And, "Let's get a known writer on this
and bring it home."

290
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:02,044
Uh, which, of course, l didn't love, but which
as an unproduced writer at that time...

291
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,296
...I had been told to expect
from the very beginning.

292
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,756
So I wasn't that surprised.

293
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,549
And they talked to a number of writers...

294
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,760
...and Damon was the guy who got it,
in their view...

295
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,138
...and really seemed to love the story
for what it was, to understand its soul...

296
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:17,559
...and to be happy to carry forward
in the spirit of what had been done so far.

297
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,855
Maybe it's a day later,
because they're trudging to the next silo.

298
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:26,902
Uh, you have the birth of the silvertish
that comes out of the body...

299
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,072
...of the Engineer and comes for her.

300
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,324
I think that's the end on the end.

301
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,493
The idea of taking Alien...

302
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:38,622
...which is just essentially this very cool,
"ln space, no one can hear you scream"...

303
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,669
...it's terrifying, but on a thematic level,
it's kind ofjust is what it is.

304
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,337
To take that and suddenly say:

305
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:49,091
"Now let's start to play
with all these incredibly heady ideas...

306
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,386
...just about philosophically speaking
about God and the universe."

307
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,597
And then, you know, you say,
"Here's a bunch of humans...

308
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:59,601
...that are seeking out a race of beings who
may or may not have created life on Earth.

309
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,772
And they're bringing with them
this synthetic human that they've created."

310
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,941
You now have a couple
of different generations.

311
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,902
And so you have this character, David,
on the ship with them...

312
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,113
...who basically has a perspective of:

313
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,448
"Hey, l hang out with my creators
all the time.

314
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,618
And you might be disappointed,
I have to be honest with you."

315
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,328
Suddenly bringing that into the mix...

316
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,956
...which was very much there already
in Jon's draft...

317
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,126
...I felt like, "Okay,
let's make this thing about creation."

318
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,045
And that opened a tremendous
amount of doors.

319
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:31,007
And certainly that was the movie that
I think Ridley wanted to make all along.

320
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,093
SCOTT:
They are religious.

321
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,096
Because the whole story
is about who made them.

322
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,806
-Yeah. Right.
-God made them.

323
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:41,435
MAX: What they discovered
was never explained in the first movie.

324
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,479
So it was really a kind of blank canvas
for us.

325
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,023
LlNDELOF:
I do not write well alone.

326
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:51,027
And in this case,
it's why l really love television so much...

327
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,572
...because it's such
a collaborative writing process.

328
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,451
Since this was the first movie
that I was really working on "alone"...

329
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,163
...um, uh, Ridley became the guy
that I co-wrote the movie with.

330
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,585
SPAIHTS: You really are creating
not just some characters and a tale...

331
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,671
...but a whole world,
the universe in which they live.

332
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,676
And you're crafting spaceships
and planetoids...

333
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:18,180
...technology and events
that can't happen in this world.

334
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,849
You're really inventing from the whole cloth
an alien species.

335
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,685
Their language, their cataclysmic fate.

336
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,564
Um, that's a great big canvas to paint on.

337
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:33,695
LlNDELOF: We had intense story sessions over
the course of probably four or five weeks.

338
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:37,032
At least three hours or four hours
at a time, three days a week...

339
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,493
...before I went off
and generated my draft...

340
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,747
...which l wrote very quickly because
by then l had such a clear understanding...

341
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,373
...going scene by scene.

342
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,959
And of course,
I can't really think off the top of my head...

343
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,379
...of a more brilliant visual director
working in the medium right now...

344
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,757
...especially for this kind of a movie.

345
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:56,009
And so l would just sit and listen...

346
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,346
...to how Ridley described
how he saw the scenes visually.

347
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,348
And then I just kind of
had to figure out...

348
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,350
...what characters were saying
to each other...

349
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,560
...or how to get into those moments.

350
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:10,732
SPAIHTS: To be engaged in that act of
world creation is a huge turn-on for any writer.

351
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,861
And then on top of that,
to be engaged in that in collaboration...

352
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:19,741
...with a filmmaker of the magnitude
and skill of Ridley Scott...

353
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,452
...and the team that he assembled,
it's just a gift.

354
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,248
Hey, how you doing?

355
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,249
[English - US - SDH]
Hey, how you doing?

356
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:38,385
Science fiction is much harder
than doing the ancient world, for example.

357
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:43,014
Whereas, with science fiction,
everything has to be invented.

358
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,684
MESSING:
We tried to be truthful to the first film...

359
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,520
...but also give moments
that were unique and new.

360
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,564
Some of that was in the color
and the lighting...

361
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,107
...and opening up the atmosphere...

362
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:55,151
...and giving more scale and depth
to the environment.

363
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,364
PROCTER: lt's not an aesthetic choice
for Ridley. It's a thematic choice.

364
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:04,035
And our job was to kind of make
that thematic choice visually palatable...

365
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,245
...and workable.

366
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:10,208
His attitude toward creating is very similar
to the way we paint, actually.

367
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:15,797
Which is a lot by creating accidents
and almost misdirection.

368
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:21,428
You know, trying to find a way
of creating that's not the usual way.

369
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:25,724
SCOTT: Monsters are difficult
because every goddamn hideous monster...

370
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,183
...has been explored.

371
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,353
Monsters. These are beautiful.

372
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:35,358
Until somebody comes up with something
that's different. You go, "That's different."

373
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:54,502
MAX: lt was like a think-tank room
that we were all set up in...

374
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,964
...in a building adjacent
to Ridley's offices.

375
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,175
So that he can come and participate.

376
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:03,595
Everybody had their voice heard
in that room.

377
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,555
I mean, you could cam-lever it from here.

378
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,808
You could just give it a structural post
and it just cam levers the other way.

379
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,894
Then the part that you need
to hit the ground....

380
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,104
MAX:
The walls were lined with artwork.

381
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,648
We started off with empty walls...

382
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:19,110
...and slowly we ran out of space
several times.

383
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,613
The discussions were
round-table discussions.

384
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,823
Everybody had an opinion.

385
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,910
I was thinking that, the four tentacles,
of having it just moving around...

386
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,829
-Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hm, mm-hm.
-...would be really good acting.

387
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,581
It would give you options, that's all.

388
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,584
SCOTT: The design was one of the things
I really enjoyed doing.

389
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,837
And so, between Arthur Max
and finding his team...

390
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:42,509
...he got in these designers
who are kind of cyber-world designers.

391
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,969
They design stuff
on these marvelous laptops.

392
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:49,516
Arthur chose, literally handpicked,
I think, honestly...

393
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,351
...five of the best in the business.

394
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,772
Absolutely superlative capabilities.

395
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,857
And because l can draw....

396
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,901
And also there's many
reference photographs.

397
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,238
Arthur and I always work on a lot
of reference photographs saying:

398
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:07,200
"Like this, like that, but not like that.
Physically like this, but not like that."

399
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:11,371
And so you're suddenly getting
absolute points of reference...

400
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,581
...saying, "Do me a sketch of this.

401
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,000
I know l didn't like that
because l've done that before."

402
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,337
So how do you get off on something
which looks slightly different?

403
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,630
It's really hard.

404
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,550
-That's a great little sketch.
-Yeah.

405
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,052
-Thank God for art school.
PAGE: Yeah.

406
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,888
MESSING: We would have meetings
and then Jon Spaihts would come in...

407
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:32,142
...and work with Arthur and us
and Ridley too.

408
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,687
It was interesting.
I've never had a experience...

409
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,356
...where a director would sit next to me
and literally draw.

410
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,609
And I would draw and he would draw.
Then he'd say, "What do you think of this?"

411
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,697
And then we'd flesh it out more and then
show it to him and he'd draw back over it.

412
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,908
Very few people are true artists
in this industry...

413
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,910
...and he is one of them.

414
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,581
You know, he could design
the whole movie himself if he had the time.

415
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,462
LEVY: We found that there was a lot
of pressure on us.

416
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,965
And it wasn't given by anybody
aside from us.

417
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,468
But we really wanted, visually...

418
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:11,306
...to tie in those two universes
which are part of this one universe.

419
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:14,392
And the difficulty was exactly that,
is that on the first one...

420
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,395
...you're into like a trucker type
of environment that's very raw...

421
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,939
...and very bulky and things like that.

422
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:23,067
And we had to tie it in with a universe
that's much more sharp...

423
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,694
...and very design-ly detailed.

424
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:28,364
And it was very tricky for us to do so...

425
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,034
...without feeling like
we were gonna disappoint fans.

426
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:35,163
I mean, we are fans ofAlien
and we don't want to disappoint.

427
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:40,168
It's got out of control with the build-up of
liquid and calcium over a thousand years.

428
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,797
Although it was supposed to be
a highly secretive room...

429
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:48,760
...with warning signs on the door
and "do not enter unless authorized"...

430
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,639
...people came and went very freely,
and ideas changed...

431
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:56,059
...as people came and went
and encountered the latest thinking.

432
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,978
And there was an open forum
for discussion.

433
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,440
That was, I think, very healthy and fertile.

434
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:06,486
SCOTT: l would go in there on a regular basis
for a period of almost four months, actually...

435
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,823
...designing the absoluteness
of the landscapes...

436
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,493
...the interior of the ships, the rooms,
the suits...

437
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:16,496
...the creatures that we might see.

438
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:21,668
Everything was designed here
with four or five people.

439
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:24,504
-Hello.
MAN: Hi.

440
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,340
PROCTER: Ridley would come by with--
You knew Ridley was coming...

441
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:31,261
...because a tray of red wine would show up
with enough glasses for everyone.

442
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,304
"Oh, l guess Ridley's gonna come by."
Ha, ha.

443
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,974
I love the conglomeration
of people in headsets.

444
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,685
PROCTER: To be working
on such a grand franchise...

445
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:41,813
...you wouldn't necessarily expect
the process to be so intimate...

446
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,190
...and kind of friendly, but it was.
It was really nice.

447
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:47,652
You get an A for attitude.

448
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,195
[MEN CHUCKLE]

449
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,574
And he just thought that was all great.

450
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,618
These are storyboards...

451
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,203
...drawn by Ridley.

452
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,414
Some of them are just simple diagrams...

453
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:05,461
...helping to think through set designs
and ideas...

454
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,340
...for intercutting between characters...

455
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,260
...and actions and locations
in the movie.

456
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,596
And it's really a blueprint...

457
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,223
...a very simple blueprint, at this stage...

458
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:20,018
...to plan the movie.

459
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:25,189
I got lucky, in a way, because I came across
a guy called H.R. Giger...

460
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,066
...29, 30 years ago.

461
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:31,195
And Giger had this one picture
which I always thought was:

462
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,573
"That's it. That is it."

463
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:36,117
He'd already done it. lt was in a book.

464
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:39,454
SCANLAN: We know the ultimate, in a sense.
We've seen that point.

465
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,832
To move back from that
was a sort of comforting way of saying...

466
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,045
...we have to hold onto
the Giger-type elements.

467
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,255
We have to hold onto the purity
of the original...

468
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:52,091
...but at the same time,
try and bring in new elements...

469
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:56,095
...things that are not necessarily backward
from where we were...

470
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,766
...but are of a similar DNA.

471
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,811
SCOTT: How are you doing?
-This is Laura.

472
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,773
MAX:
We met with Giger personally.

473
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:10,109
He came over and we did a presentation
of all our designs...

474
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,945
...and hoped he would react positively...

475
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:16,032
...you know, because we wanted him
to be impressed with what we had done.

476
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,993
We discussed with him
some fresco panels...

477
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:22,455
...based on some of the designs
he had done for the first movie...

478
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:23,748
...that were never used.

479
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,960
Ridley had turned me
onto some of the drawings.

480
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:30,880
Said, you know, "Can we do something
with these shapes and designs?"

481
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:35,259
Ridley felt it was very important
to involve Giger in the design of this film...

482
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,638
...and he really wanted to involve him
in any way he could.

483
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,808
The other question is,
when he's in the space suit...

484
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:45,728
...without the helmet,
does his head start to change?

485
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,523
MESSING: We were trying to keep things
in the vein of him...

486
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,608
...even though there was
definite departures.

487
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,319
But he appreciated that,
and he definitely--

488
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,780
Even a few pieces, he even said,
you know, "That's mine."

489
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:56,990
This is Genesis.

490
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,201
This is his flight suit,
this is his pressure suit.

491
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:04,163
-It's nice, huh? There's his pressure suit.
-Yeah, yeah.

492
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,208
-But l took off this, which is yours...
-Yeah.

493
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:11,337
...to say, how does he slide into that,
into the shell?

494
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,256
-Uh-huh.
-That's his shell.

495
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,343
This looks like a baby.

496
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:19,762
A bad baby.

497
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,642
[GRUNTS]

498
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,228
Anyway, it's a thought.

499
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:30,523
SCOTT: He saw what I was doing, l think
he thought l was so far down the road...

500
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:34,902
...I think he was a bit amazed
at how things have changed now...

501
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,863
...how fast things are moving.

502
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:40,867
And honestly,
we just had to move quickly and move on.

503
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:44,370
There's a couple drawings here and there
that he did which are kind of interesting...

504
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:47,957
...but fundamentally l just didn't have time.
I had to move.

505
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:53,212
But l hope he likes the film
because it's still based on his original id--

506
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,717
Or origins of him are in this film,
which is the guy in the chair...

507
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:02,472
...who is the space jockey,
that will always be H.R. Giger.

508
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:07,977
The pilot chamber is like a sacred cow
of the Alien tradition...

509
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:13,316
...and it was with great trepidation
that I approached the design for that.

510
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:20,073
And all the concept artists
were high priests of science fiction...

511
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,912
...and were extremely critical
of any outrageous...

512
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,665
...to be applied to their icon...

513
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,417
...their holy of holies...

514
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:34,921
...the space jockey chair and chamber.

515
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:39,217
PROCTER: Essentially what l tried to do was
something that was as close as possible...

516
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:43,096
...to the original movie's version
of what Giger had done...

517
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,722
...Giger's original illustrations...

518
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,433
...that preceded that sculpt
of the original movie...

519
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,853
...but that also incorporated,
you know, new functional requirements...

520
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,855
...that were simply not seen in the movie.

521
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,149
MESSING: A lot of research went
into recreating that chair.

522
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:58,069
And, you know, you may have thought
we just had archival reference...

523
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,404
...and we could just--
We had the blueprints. We didn't.

524
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,033
We had to dig deep to find reference...

525
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:07,245
...to reconstruct that chair
as accurately as we could.

526
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,373
And then everything else from it
kind of grew out of that.

527
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:13,960
And all the design changes
were very challenging...

528
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:17,296
...but to keep it consistent with the original
was quite a task.

529
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:21,259
PROCTER: The thing has to articulate
vertically and come out of the floor...

530
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,344
...as this giant vertical thing
that tips down...

531
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,097
...introduces a whole different set
of concerns...

532
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,683
...for the layout of the various parts.

533
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:32,603
Giger had put in some, you know,
gear-toothed kind of arcing elements...

534
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:37,275
...and some feeling of articulation
to the three sets of rods...

535
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:41,154
...that support the cannon on the end
that were definitely the starting-off point...

536
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,282
...for allowing that kind of an action,
but still it had to be figured out.

537
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,784
Okay, if it does that,
which parts kind of go with it?

538
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,829
Which ones move? Which ones don't?
And how do the layers, you know, work?

539
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:53,082
I was able to actually produce
a rigged model...

540
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,209
...of how this thing would work.

541
00:29:55,377 --> 00:30:00,339
We shifted the emphasis
of the biological forms...

542
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,634
...that Giger tended to play up.

543
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,678
We played those down...

544
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,848
...and we went more toward
the mechanical forms.

545
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:11,726
Sometimes we would definitely clash
with the production designer...

546
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:15,813
...where he would see, for example,
for the whole Engineer architecture...

547
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,481
...in those basements, you know?

548
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,444
He would see something that's very
monolithic and very, very simple...

549
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,864
...and Ben, Steve and l, we'd go much more
towards a Gigerish approach, you know?

550
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,366
Which is much more organic...

551
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,703
...and much more,
I would say, shocking...

552
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:34,707
...and almost, l mean, very weird,
you know?

553
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:38,419
You see this in the design, in many ways,
where it is a mixture of that.

554
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:42,882
Of very monolithic architectural,
giant monolithic, and Gigerish world.

555
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,719
But in a way, l think it created
for a very interesting look.

556
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:49,055
MESSING:
In the chamber room, there was these pods.

557
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:51,098
We did a ton of versions, me and David...

558
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:55,186
...and I ended up kind of taking it over
and was really fleshing out the details for it.

559
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,731
And Ridley wasn't sure. He wanted
to orient it, you know, head to toe.

560
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,275
Where were the Engineers sleeping?
How were they facing?

561
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,735
Why were they in here?

562
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,946
And we ended up, he said,
"You know what?

563
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:10,243
We can just put this in front
of the telescoping, you know, pilot chair...

564
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,746
...and it'd be a great story moment
where you see these sleeping pods...

565
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,539
...but you don't know the purpose of it."

566
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,792
In Ridley's mind,
it could be a different spaceship.

567
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,586
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
Maybe he's just changing it.

568
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:24,257
He doesn't need to explain
why he's doing it. lt's for the story.

569
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,385
SCOTT:
It was a skeleton in a chair.

570
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,388
And I said,
"Well, no, it wasn't. It was a suit."

571
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,350
Said, "You think of space suits
in a very conventional fashion.

572
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:40,523
If I'm telling you it wasn't a skeleton,
but in fact it was-- Not an exoskeleton.

573
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:44,151
It's an organic suit, that's what it is.

574
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,321
I'm gonna show you how it opens
and what's inside...

575
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,449
...because what's inside is a humanoid."

576
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:54,453
LEVY:
My first reaction was to be horrified.

577
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,915
I was thinking,
"He's taking such a cult thing...

578
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,419
...and what is he doing with it?
This can't work."

579
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,337
And I think that's what he does best.

580
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,673
He takes something
that you think you know...

581
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,800
...and he just turns it upside down.

582
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:12,847
MESSING: It's probably one of the
most iconic figures in sci-fi history.

583
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:17,476
When Ridley was first talking about
the idea of having this human figure...

584
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:21,314
...representing the space jockey character,
we all pretty much hated it.

585
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,899
HUANTE: He had seen a sculpture
that I had done...

586
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,153
...and this character
was, you know, completely lopsided...

587
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:29,864
...and really muscular and blown out,
and he loved it.

588
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:33,159
The photograph
that I took of it too was, uh....

589
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:35,870
It was really hot. So it was really just--

590
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,331
You know, it looked ghostly.

591
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,250
MESSING: It was interesting but we didn't think
it was really appropriate.

592
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:45,671
But then, you know, as the storyline
progressed and Ridley was really....

593
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,840
You know,
he was very confident about this.

594
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,176
He was not gonna--
No one was gonna change his mind.

595
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,594
It still retains that...

596
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:53,846
-...but it looks more helmet-like.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

597
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:57,350
SCANLAN: We call the Engineer
an elephantine Engineer...

598
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,310
...because of the trunk.

599
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,688
It's the suit that the Engineers wear...

600
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:06,525
...in order to be able to travel in space.

601
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:10,529
And when they're not in that,
they're wearing what we call a pressure suit.

602
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:14,325
So the design of the Engineer
was driven from that perspective...

603
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:18,287
...that actually the big discovery is
that this isn't a creature in its own right.

604
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,665
This is a suit.
This is worn by another being.

605
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:26,879
MAX: l think Ridley found it more interesting
if they were our creators that--

606
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:29,590
He kept quoting the Bible passage:

607
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,718
"And God created man
in his own image."

608
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,471
SCOTT: l thought,
if you're gonna be biblical about it...

609
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,391
...then is religion erased memory?

610
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,645
Was there really God,
was there the son of God...

611
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:46,065
...or were they visitations
of superior beings?

612
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,693
-Warrior priests or something. Mm-hm.
-Exactly right.

613
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,406
And here is something
slightly ominous...

614
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,201
...which is a serious pair
of high-tech shoes-- Boots.

615
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,703
MAX:
We got Neville Page involved.

616
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,498
Neville specializes in creature design.

617
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:06,961
And we introduced him
to the physical anatomy...

618
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,754
...that was a brief from Ridley...

619
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,966
...that it shouldn't be like
a bodybuilder musculature.

620
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,093
It should be like classical statuary.

621
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:18,764
When you look at them,
they're very much more compact...

622
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,558
...and less over-developed...

623
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,687
...but exaggerated in every detail.

624
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:27,648
And so we try to express those...

625
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:31,485
...and overlay them
with this classical veneer...

626
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:32,945
...to make them god-like.

627
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:38,784
PAGE: I spent a lot of time developing,
you know, the ultimate head...

628
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,703
...which was classical-art driven.

629
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:46,292
We kept looking at da Vinci's work
for that bulky, husky body...

630
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,879
...the strong nose, the small lips.
You know it was like--

631
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,841
The names thrown out were David,
the David sculpture...

632
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:57,470
...the Statue of Liberty and Elvis Presley.

633
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,014
And when you hear that as a brief,
you're like:

634
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,475
"What the hell am I gonna do?" Ha, ha.

635
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,144
I understood, though,
as you look at those three images, you go:

636
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,645
"Oh, l get it, l get it."

637
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:11,066
It's that specific mouth,
that nose and these eyes.

638
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:15,488
MAX: He wanted them to be,
in a strange sort of way, beautiful...

639
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,573
...and not frightening.

640
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,784
Frightening comes with attitude.

641
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,995
ELLENBERG:
The first camera test with the Engineer...

642
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:24,830
...he scared the people walking around.

643
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:27,750
Not because he did anything.
It was that unsettling.

644
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,336
Because you did feel--
The effect we were going for...

645
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:34,673
...in creating the design of those Engineers,
manifested itself in reality.

646
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:38,636
Which is, it was deeply unsettling to see
something that was kind of superhuman...

647
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,514
...kind of vacant in the eyes,
blackened eyes...

648
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,099
...looking down at you
and looking kind of upset at you.

649
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,019
The way in which it felt
like an angry father...

650
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:50,022
...or angry parent was troubling.

651
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,108
It was, you know, a lit room.
It was not like he was doing anything fancy.

652
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,527
It was just scary.

653
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:58,113
All the actors got to experience that
and they got to interact with an actor...

654
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:02,368
...and have dialogue with those characters
and not just talk to some blank screen.

655
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:05,371
RAPACE: I really like that it's really
kind of attractive the same way...

656
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,039
...because they're beautiful.

657
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,792
You wanna go closer,
you wanna touch them in a way.

658
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,048
You wanna kind of be embraced by them
and that makes it much more interesting.

659
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,718
SCOTT:
I don't like to repeat myself...

660
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:23,514
...so you're constantly evolving
with these guys...

661
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,725
...who are really great creators
in their own right.

662
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,353
So frequently we'll just talk or scribble,
saying:

663
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,690
"No, like this, or like that."
We've now got such a marvelous wealth...

664
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:37,069
...of encyclopedic wealth of information
on any laptop.

665
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:40,489
Like, we designed a thing,
this is called a Trilobite...

666
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,241
...by just going into deep-sea things...

667
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:46,370
...and looking at things
which are marvelous details.

668
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,122
God's the best designer in the world.

669
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,499
You can't do better than God.

670
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:53,669
I think, you know, Carlos Huante's,
Neville Page and Neal Scanlan's team...

671
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,755
...did a good job of trying to take
this monumental task...

672
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,925
...of at least being
on the same level as Alien...

673
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,677
...which was, you know,
almost impossible.

674
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:04,680
Can l do a combination
of the veins plus this?

675
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,600
Because this is changing cranium.

676
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:12,187
SCANLAN: Holloway's infected.
He then impregnates Shaw...

677
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,982
...and from that, Shaw then gives birth,
in a sense...

678
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,234
...to what we call the Med-Pod creature...

679
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:20,112
...which was extracted through
from her stomach.

680
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,115
That then grows into the Trilobite.

681
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,035
What's sort of happening
almost in tangent with that is Fifield.

682
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,997
And Fifield's been exposed to the gloop
and so he begins to go through...

683
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,375
...a sort of, you know, transformation
independent of that...

684
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:37,004
...and becomes what we call
the Fifield creature.

685
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:40,549
And that ultimately the Engineer
crossed with the Trilobite...

686
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:46,263
...gives us what we call the deacon,
and he is the penultimate--

687
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:50,809
As far as the film is concerned,
the penultimate combination of all of this.

688
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:54,480
SCOTT: The idea of biting the umbilical.
MAN: Yeah?

689
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:55,814
Think it's too much?

690
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,818
MAN: l think it's, you know, an interesting
idea for the European version.

691
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:03,822
The evolutions that emerge from them...

692
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,911
...evolve to higher and higher forms,
which you see illustrated here...

693
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:14,166
...eventually leading back
to the original Giger alien.

694
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:18,462
So we're basically attempting
to deconstruct Giger's alien...

695
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,257
...and show how it evolved
from its humanoid host...

696
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,677
...both Earthly humans...

697
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:29,181
...and our space jockey Engineer species.

698
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:34,853
HUANTE: I go, "Oh, we have to have
the precursor to the facehugger...

699
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,940
...that looks like this centipede thing
that is--

700
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:40,859
Centipede of the facehugger
who's got, like, a hundred fingers."

701
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,866
This thing just crawls around
and that's the thing that attacks the guy.

702
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,660
Grabs him, grabs his arm.

703
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:53,539
Then we could have that cool 1 970s
science-fiction astronaut...

704
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,499
...you know, looking at his arm.

705
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,629
This thing has grabbed his hand
and, you know, that'd be cool, right?

706
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:03,757
And I know Ridley's all about that.
He gets that.

707
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:09,680
SCANLAN: The Med-Pod creature
was really a baby form.

708
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,558
He's an embryotic form
or a baby form of this.

709
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:15,728
And Ivan Manzella
did a number of sketches...

710
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,397
...and designs in ZBrush.

711
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:22,943
And we showed those to Ridley
and I think we got lucky.

712
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,904
We showed Ridley something, and he said,
"Yeah, that's great."

713
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:29,658
And so we had that design quite early...

714
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:33,120
...and that gave us the blueprint
for where we would go later.

715
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,705
He just worked well as a design.

716
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,624
The fact that the tentacles
are fused initially...

717
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,711
...and that they split
and they continue to split...

718
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,756
...to create the tentacles later.

719
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,259
This is Ivan.
He's working on the Med-Pod creature...

720
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:52,431
...which is obviously taken out of Shaw
in the Med-Pod sequence.

721
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:57,102
We're inside a little room within a room,
really, and this is our sort of fortress.

722
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:02,065
The work that goes on in here
is the concept design for the creatures.

723
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,651
We're working on designs here
in the U.K...

724
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,571
...we're doing designs that have
been worked on as well in the States.

725
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:12,326
And it sort of all comes together and we get
a sort of weekly visit from Ridley...

726
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:15,621
...where we sit down at the table,
Ridley with his sketch pad...

727
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:18,624
...and we show him
sort of work in progress.

728
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:22,669
He adds elements that he feels
and points us in the right direction...

729
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,421
...and we carry on going.

730
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,132
There was one creature
that Carlos and I...

731
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,718
...were kind of batting back and forth
to one another.

732
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,388
When I was given Carlos' image
to work with...

733
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,809
...Ridley said,
"Just give me your own take on it."

734
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,478
You know, "Give me the--
What you think, alien should look like."

735
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,606
This particular--
"The baby," as it was referred to.

736
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:46,944
So I, if it's a verb,
Gigered the hell out of it...

737
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,112
...and brought it in, proud as punch...

738
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,075
...that it's like, yeah,
that really feels like Giger's aesthetic.

739
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:57,079
And Ridley was like,
"No. No, no, that's not it at all."

740
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,456
Man, we were all over the place
on Fifield.

741
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,875
I think I actually spent the most time
on Fifield.

742
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:05,170
Ridley wanted variations
of a Carlos thing that he did...

743
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,964
...which was a baby face.

744
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,133
And the baby-face character
that was Fifield...

745
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:14,721
...was gonna have inverted legs
and a bit of a tail.

746
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:19,768
It was like a very, very quick morph
from Fifield to this monster.

747
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,563
Oh, that one is still the best.
Carlos' drawing.

748
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,859
PAGE: That's mark one. That's the original.
SCOTT: That's the best. Yep.

749
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,528
The concern was, for a lot of it...

750
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:33,365
...Ridley's feelings were that
it looked too much like a goblin.

751
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,326
As soon as you get to that,
it doesn't work somehow.

752
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,329
It's got a goblin. Somehow it's a goblin.

753
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,707
SCANLAN: lt looks a bit like Gollum.
SCOTT: Yeah.

754
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,584
It's better than Gollum, actually.

755
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:47,754
And then we took it more where Fifield
would be infected...

756
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:51,633
...still humanoid,
limb length would grow...

757
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:55,512
...and we needed to keep
some of his features...

758
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,514
...which, again,
that's a real tough balance...

759
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,642
...because as soon as you start to morph
it into a creature, they disappear.

760
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,686
So we talked about the tattoo...

761
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:07,858
...and making that tattoo, wherever it be,
on the face or on his body...

762
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,777
...and having that become something
that will allow us...

763
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:15,324
...to basically see that it's still Fifield.

764
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,576
Martin, that we saw earlier...

765
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:20,913
...is working on further
sort of Fifield designs.

766
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,582
And again, back to Ridley on those...

767
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,251
...back to his,
back to the sculpting process.

768
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:30,505
PAGE: At this point, it was clear
we're not trying to do Giger's aesthetic.

769
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,215
We weren't gonna do the facehugger...

770
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:37,346
...and we weren't going to do
any kind of metaphor to the first film.

771
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,891
But at the same time,
this Trilobite creature...

772
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,269
...became, like, the uber-metaphor
of the facehugger, in a way.

773
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:47,773
Because it's very tentacular...

774
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:49,775
...it's, in the same way, somewhat sexual.

775
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:52,277
And quite honestly, on that one...

776
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:56,949
...when l was done with
kind of the face of it, if it even has one...

777
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:02,871
...it had the most vulvas
that I've ever put into a design. Ha, ha.

778
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,417
It was a celebration of vulvas, really,
which seemed appropriate.

779
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:11,630
It's just the way
the organic mechanism works.

780
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,800
The fact that it had seven tentacles...

781
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:16,802
...that was a struggle for me
quite a while...

782
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,805
...because we didn't wanna do
just an octopus.

783
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,974
And there was a few images
at the very beginning...

784
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,601
...where it looked just like an octopus.

785
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:28,480
But in the end,
it was all about one pose that I did...

786
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:32,651
...to give it a sense of, one, locomotion...

787
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:36,530
...and make it look like there was power
and strength in these tentacles...

788
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:38,991
...to actually lift it off of the ground.

789
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,118
How powerful can we make this look?

790
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,705
And between the combination of
Weta's efforts and Alex Alvarez...

791
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:48,041
...I just looked at it and thought,
"This thing's pretty bad-ass."

792
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,502
The deacon, the ultramorph...

793
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,838
...I think, really, from the beginning...

794
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:56,091
...Carlos kind of nailed it.

795
00:43:56,259 --> 00:44:00,387
There were a couple versions
of the alien that l--

796
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:03,515
The Xenomorph, the ultramorph,
whatever it became.

797
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:08,687
That I-- lt was straight out
of one of Giger's paintings.

798
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,480
I embellished a little couple things...

799
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:14,067
...but l kept it as close to his stuff
as I could.

800
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:18,280
You have to. He invented the look.

SCANLAN: Sometimes, l think, your
first impressions are often the best.

802
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:24,870
I remember when we joined the project
there was a drawing in existence...

803
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:28,331
...of a rather silver-y,
metallic-looking deacon--

804
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:32,002
The deacon being the description
for the point at the back of the head.

805
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:36,256
--lying in a pool of fluid,
and it was quite impressionistic...

806
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:37,758
...but it was great.

807
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:42,429
And I think we went down
so many different alternatives.

808
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:46,266
When it came to it,
nothing was better than that one thing.

people, was like a landmark watershed thing.

I mean, it reinvented the look
of science-fiction movies forever.

I got the feeling right away...

823
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:40,654
...that I don't think Ridley Scott
just wants to rehash the familiar territory.

824
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:44,241
He wanted to capture the effect
of the first Alien.

825
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:49,746
He was gonna take the same elements
and present them in a new way.

826
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:53,416
The stylings that we were working on
were reminiscent of the Nostromo...

827

but at the same time...

environment...

833
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,857

[GASPlNG]

835
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:39,129
I was cast to do development
for the human technology.

836
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:43,800
First thing l started on was the excavation.

837
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:48,722
They had these excavation pods.
They were kind of like submersibles.

838
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:51,725
They were hovering around,
and I assumed it was Mars.

839
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:53,643
And they're digging.

840
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:59,149
They shear off this cliff
and there are hieroglyphs.

841
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:02,903
They approach Weyland to get funding.

842
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,823
Weyland doesn't have an office
like in an office building.

843
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:10,994
So the first idea was that
it was on this enormous habitat...

844
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,455
...you know, like a huge space station.

845
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:18,835
So they travel there in sort of a shuttle
and they land...

846
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:23,965
...and we developed this enormous
biosphere kind of thing.

847
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:29,512
It was a huge ring with farmland and lakes
and things inside of it.

848
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,391
And the idea was that Weyland
is already developing--

849
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:37,854
He's basically developing the solar system.

850
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,485
MESSING:
Prometheus was actually called--

851
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:46,154
Originally, in the early script,
it was called the Magellan...

852
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:49,199
...and it was this voyage and trying
to discover uncharted territories.

853
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:52,869
And then Ridley decided
to name it the Prometheus...

854
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,247
...after he had already named the movie.

855
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,708
MAX: The Prometheus is the flagship
of the Weyland fleet.

856
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:03,964
Weyland, the character who's our chairman
of the board of the corporation, it's his ship.

857
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,592
And on his ship, we decided
it was gonna be state-of-the-art...

858
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,053
...with every conceivable facility...

859

...including a penthouse suite
with cutting-edge medical facility...

...communication systems,
scanning systems...

861
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:25,151
...infinite capacity for
entering hostile planetary climates.

862
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,238
PROCTER:
Good production design is so heavily driven...

863
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,156
...by the basic volumes of the spaces...

864
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,242
...and the needs
of what the camera's gonna do...

865
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,828
...and the functional aspects
of the storytelling...

866
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:38,331
...that Arthur was able to give us all the
guidance we needed for all those things...

867
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:42,419
...and that last little bit of, you know,
kind of icing, filigree, sci-fi techy stuff...

868
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,839
...that was up to us to help him with,
but that didn't mean...

869
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:49,050
...that he wasn't guiding the ship in terms
of what components were needed...

870
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:51,219
...and how big they ought to be
and everything else.

871
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:56,599
Specifically, it's a ship of exploration
that's got a lot of equipment.

872
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,769
What Arthur and Ridley said was that...

873
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,440
...you know,
this thing lands and it opens up...

874
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:09,446
...and it becomes like a mobile factory.
You know, it's like a complex.

875
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:14,909
And so l started thinking about
oil exploration ships, oil rigs.

876
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:19,622
They're these huge platforms
that float around on these big legs.

877
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:24,961
And that sort of became
the very starting point of the shape.

878
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:30,925
MAX:
I wanted to have some kind of animal aspect...

879
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:34,471
...like an insect that could land...

880
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:39,434
...but also have another level
of image overlaying it.

881
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,644
It wasn't just an aircraft.

882
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:47,108
It also had a kind of identity beyond aircraft.

883
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:51,988
Great big cargo bays,
almost like some insects carry their young...

884
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,907
...under their belly, like spiders do.

885
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:58,828
And so these pods would open up
and it would be a modular system of pods...

886
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:04,125
...carried on an underbelly
of a gigantic gantry crane...

887
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:06,878
...that would be able to fly and free-stand.

888
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:09,756
Probably the most difficult thing
with this design...

889
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:14,761
...was the fact that it winds up standing
on these giant pillars...

890
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:19,474
...which became the engines,
but it can't fly that way.

891
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:24,896
It became pretty clear that the engines
had to change their orientation.

892
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:28,024
The Nostromo
had its propulsion engines...

893
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:32,070
...and then it had these other engines
that were the landing engines.

894
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:36,491
And I thought, "Well, if we're gonna
make this thing move around...

895
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:43,123
...what if there's just the main engines
and they use that for everything?"

896
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:49,712
We ended up with this design with four
engines which became legs, landing legs.

897
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,383
PROCTER: The kind of functional parameters
that they wanted with these four...

898
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:56,845
...you know, VTOL vectoring engines
and the feeling of a creature...

899
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,889
...kind of sitting on the landscape
with these four big legs...

900
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:04,310
...you know, those desires were so clearly
strong with Ridley and Arthur both...

901
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:08,398
...that I knew that whatever l adapted from
Steve's had to incorporate that.

902
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:13,736
And frankly, one of Steve's models
was extremely close to that concept.

903
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,405
And then it was just a detailing pass.

904
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:18,241
It was just figuring out
what's the surface breakup and detailing...

905
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:21,244
...that will give this thing
the scale that it needs, because it's huge.

906
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,788
And it has a fairly aeronautic shape...

907
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:26,749
...that makes it look like, you know,
an atmospheric flying vehicle.

908
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,627
I mean, the Nostromo was like a box.
It was chunky and it didn't--

909
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,504
It looked like it could land on a planet...

910
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:34,424
...but it was not meant to fly around
on a planet, whereas this one...

911
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,927
...really could do long-distance sorties
on a planet in its atmosphere.

912
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,805
But at the same time,
it wanted to feel a bit like Alien 1.

913
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:43,391
At least in my mind,
that's what I wanted it to feel like.

914
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:46,519
And it wanted to have a sense of scale...

915
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:51,149
...that traditionally they got by, you know,
kit-bashing tons of little tank parts...

916
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:54,652
...and battleship parts and all kinds of stuff
onto miniature models.

917
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:58,698
And so l took it upon myself to kind of
really study pictures of the Nostromo...

918
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:01,910
...and I would literally kit-bash
in Photoshop...

919
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,620
...whole chunks of the Nostromo skin...

920
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,540
...and lay that onto my illustrations
to get that exact kind of...

921
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:11,461
...you know, pipe conduits running
on the surface and all that kind of stuff.

922
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:17,258
The landing foot is made up of a piece
of a Terex mining bulldozer's shovel bit...

923
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:20,261
...and pieces of World War Il
German sort of train tanks...

924
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:24,432
...and all kinds of crazy stuff.
I mean, I literally used the old methods.

925
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,818
MAX: We tried to do graphics with steroids
on this one.

926
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:40,782
Very bold, on an enormous scale,
including the exterior of the Prometheus...

927
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:46,871
...which is kind of based on the graphics
from various fighter aircrafts...

928
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:49,374
...and bombers from World War lI.

929
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:51,751
PROCTER:
I did it in a huge number of color schemes.

930
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:55,213
Ended up doing some stuff that was stronger
than l initially was comfortable with...

931
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:58,007
...in terms of yellow stripes
and things that were influenced by...

932
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,885
...beautiful Messerschmitts
and different fighters from World War Il.

933
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,929
But l have to say that the use of the yellow...

934
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:06,349
...and the use of it with white and black,
graphically, it's worked really well.

935
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:09,894
And what's neat is that it does relate back
to some of the early concept work...

936
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:14,649
...of Chris Foss and Ron Cobb as well
from Alien 1 .

937
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:17,694
Then l worked on almost
all of the human interior sets...

938
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,989
...whether it be the Weyland-Vickers suite...

939
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:24,200
...which is up in the lifeboat
that lives on top of the ship...

940
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:28,580
...or the medical bay or the mess hall...

941
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,916
...or the cryo-sleep systems...

942
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:34,210
...the bridge of the ship,
which had this cool idea...

943
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:38,548
...that Ridley kind of brought back
from Alien 1 of the extruding platform...

944
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,050
...which was very much like Ash's station
on the Nostromo...

945
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,219
...but now we're using it,
you know, in the bridge.

946
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,890
MAX: The bridge is one area where
we actually looked at the design work...

947
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,351
...that was done for the original film.

948
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:55,440
Now, the Nostromo, as we saw
when we saw the film screened...

949
00:53:55,608 --> 00:54:02,614
...I began to appreciate the claustrophobia
and how jammed up the spaces were.

950
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:07,785
In fact, Ridley mentioned
how difficult it was to film in...

951
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:12,290
...but how rich it was
because it was so tight and enclosed.

952
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:17,086
At the same time, he wanted
a sense of scale on this version...

953
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:22,133
...so we had to be large but very intimate.

954
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:24,385
PROCTER:
You know, the bridge design of Prometheus...

955
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:27,597
...is actually kind of a Ron Cobb
bridge design from Alien 1...

956
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,098
...that got split into two things.

957
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,851
It got split into the bridge
and then into Ash's pod...

958
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,728
...but originally it was sketched as one...

959
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:38,024
...and we actually kind of returned it
in some way to that Ron Cobb form.

960
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:41,069
SCOTT:
You got the desk, the cockpit...

961
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:46,240
...the main desk for Janek, the pilot,
and his copilots...

962
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:50,328
...and the feed corridors up to that,
and it's always limited.

963
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:53,498
You'd be amazed
how you have to eke out your budget...

964
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:56,793
...because sets of that quality
are very costly.

965
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,836
It's really knowing exactly what you want.

966
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:02,840
And if you know exactly what you want,
you're gonna kind of maintain budget.

967
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:06,803
If you don't know what you want and say,
"l might need it," that's when it goes up.

968
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,347
MAX:
We wanted a window.

969
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:14,769
So we decided to introduce
a gigantic wrap-around windscreen...

970
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:21,901
...multifaceted, kind of in the tradition
of a stealth bomber technology...

971
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:25,113
...very jewel-like and faceted...

972
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:31,661
...wrapping under the skull
of the insect carapace...

973
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:37,959
...and tucked under the chin, as it were,
so that you could then also include...

974
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:42,088
...a gangplank viewing platform
for the captain...

975
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:45,758
...and stand out and be able to look down
on the planet's surface below you...

976
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,969
...as you cruised on over.

977
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:52,056
PROCTER: We definitely gave thought to how
the different components of the interiors...

978
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:53,683
...fit into the ship in general.

979
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,686
A huge amount of what you're
worried about when you're building sets...

980
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,480
...is how it fits into the stages
that you have to build them in...

981
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:02,150
...and what's the height
and what's the visual-effects needs...

982
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,776
...of how far away green screens are.

983
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:07,280
The bridge is a good example of something
where the set itself has a lot of height...

984
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:11,367
...and then it has to be mounted up
a certain distance to get certain angles...

985
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:14,245
...down below the glass looking up
at the people, and then it's got--

986
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:17,540
You know, it needs the giant clearance
of green-screen lighting all around it...

987
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,375
...and, you know, at least a 270.

988
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:23,546
MAX: And that all had to be put
on engineering bellows...

989
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:28,509
...which are big, rubber,
gasketed vibration pads...

990
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:33,723
...so that we could do turbulent vibration
as we came into the atmosphere...

991
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,517
...and rock the whole ship.

992
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:40,354
And then that implied
various elements of design...

993
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,232
...i.e., is the roof attached to the walls?

994
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,694
Are the corridors attached
to the main space?

995
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:50,239
And we decided not to do that,
to detach evertyhing from each other...

996
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:54,327
...so everything was a bit free
to jostle and jangle...

997
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:57,497
...but we didn't know
how that would really behave.

998
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:02,585
I thought it might start oscillating
beyond control and smash itself to bits.

999
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,587
Fortunately, that didn't occur.

1000
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,885
Then there was design of the vehicles
to explore the planet...

1001
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:15,681
...because in the end this is
an archeological scientific expedition.

1002
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,434
So the vehicles had to be able to cope...

1003
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:23,022
...with every kind of inhospitable
environment that you can imagine.

1004
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,025
And how do we actually make
a functioning vehicle?

1005
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:29,153
And not only one vehicle but six.

1006
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:35,076
It was very interesting to take a different
take that was done on other movies...

1007
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:36,619
...which is not something military.

1008
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,956
The goal here when we worked on
the rover and the other vehicles...

1009
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:45,211
...was to have a kind of design that reflects
something more like a National Geographic.

1010
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:48,673
You know, a team of explorers
and not at all something military.

1011
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:54,637
It was more a take that was about explorers
and something that had, like, high money...

1012
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:59,058
...in order to build those vehicles,
and something that's very technically sharp.

1013
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:06,190
MAX: We ended up building
three large rovers and some ATVs...

1014
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:10,069
...which were all practical
and would be used on locations.

1015
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:13,489
We wanted them to go,
you know, 50 miles an hour...

1016
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,950
...with a dozen people onboard.

1017
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:19,745
SCOTT: So all that had to be designed
were the interior of those buses.

1018
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:24,166
The buses are driven by electronics,
so there's all the screens.

1019
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:28,504
There's a million screens
in every feasible space in that ship...

1020
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,923
...and outside each of these vehicles.

1021
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:35,845
MAX: So we went to the military, of course,
because they have the best toys.

1022
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:40,308
And then we got several
different chassis...

1023
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:46,230
...and did concept designs on each of them
in sketch form...

1024
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:49,942
...to present to Ridley,
and this went on for about a month.

1025
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,363
We got a load of notions
that basically went...

1026
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:58,826
...from vehicles that had passengers
sitting on the outside...

1027
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:01,329
...others that hovered and flew.

1028
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:07,251
So there was a very free-ranging
design phase that embraced all kinds of--

1029
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:13,090
We didn't wanna put any limits on Ridley,
saying, you know, "This is possible."

1030
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:16,093
And he picked on a few basic ideas...

1031
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:20,014
...and gave us some of his famous
Ridleygram sketches...

1032
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:24,185
...to discuss
what the shape language was...

1033
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:26,354
...and we developed from there.

1034
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:32,443
We ended up on a Czechoslovakian
surplus chassis...

1035
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,987
...a vehicle called a Tatra 8x8...

1036
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:40,701
...which is an all-terrain, all-wheel steering,
broken-axel...

1037
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:43,537
...high-speed military transport vehicle...

1038
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:47,750
...and designed our body shell on that...

1039
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:51,504
...based on an armored personnel carrier.

1040
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:55,174
Not that there was gonna be
any battle scenes...

1041
00:59:55,342 --> 01:00:02,139
...but the thinking was that these scientists
and explorers of unknown planets...

1042
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,767
...would be prepared
to encounter anything.

1043
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:08,437
We got three of them over
from Czechoslovakia...

1044
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:12,566
...stripped them all down
of their old truck bodies...

1045
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:16,862
...and then we blasted out in a great hurry
because of the constraints of time.

1046
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:23,077
I think it took us 1 1 weeks to build
from scratch once we got the chassis.

1047
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:27,289
Most car companies take about a year
or two to develop a design...

1048
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:32,545
...and then about a year to actually come up
with a single prototype vehicle.

1049
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:39,427
So that gives you a sense
of how accelerated film process is.

1050
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:43,806
A body shell that had a lot of input
from Ridley...

1051
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:48,769
...about the nuance of the proportions
of windows and angles...

1052
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:52,898
...so it had a very aggressive character
with great visibility...

1053
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:56,402
...and accessorized using
all LED lighting.

1054
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,405
We wanted to be state-of-the-art
for film lighting...

1055
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:03,200
...so all the lighting was custom designed
and installed.

1056
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:06,829
Every element of the vehicle
is made from scratch...

1057
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:11,167
...including the body shell,
interior paneling, seating...

1058
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:16,881
...and all applied
to the basic Tatra chassis.

1059
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:26,182
PROCTER: lt's very much about people
for Ridley, this story, and not about...

1060
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,685
...what could a crazy, bio-technological
alien race look like and function like?

1061
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,979
It's not really about that.

1062
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:34,732
It's about this kind of religious pursuit
of the main character...

1063
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,568
...and her quest for answers.

1064
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:46,368
MAX: There was a lot of craftsmen,
a lot of artists, a lot of technicians...

1065
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:51,540
...art directors, set designers, draftspersons
who worked with me.

1066
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,752
And without the craft skills
that they brought...

1067
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,713
...and the devotion to the work
that they brought...

1068
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,673
...it wouldn't be the movie that it is.

1069
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,221
PROCTER:
Ridley, because he created this universe...

1070
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:08,057
...is much less precious about it
than anybody else on the planet.

1071
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:10,935
You know, all of us see it as something
that's written in stone...

1072
01:02:11,103 --> 01:02:13,646
...and that has gone on
to this incredible life as a franchise...

1073
01:02:13,814 --> 01:02:16,107
...and a series and comic books
and all this kind of stuff.

1074
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:19,235
To Ridley,
I think he's aware of all those things...

1075
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:22,404
...but fundamentally,
it's still just a job he did in the 1 970s.

1076
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,406
It's something that he came up with.

1077
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,743
And if that's what it is,
then he can change it.

My experience of doing futuristic films was

Girl with the Dragon Tattoo...

1097
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:59,627
...which l thought was particularly
well done, the first one.

1098
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,795
So I was very interested in the director...

1099
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:06,175
...but l was even more interested in the girl
in the lead, who was Noomi Rapace.

1100
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:11,889
And I thought Noomi was particularly a
combination of intelligence and physicality.

So we did shoot a test ultimately.
The studio requested it.

1119
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:17,830
There was also, from their standpoint,
I would say a legitimate question:

really exciting, with her and with Dariusz Wolski.

That was the first day Ridley
and Dariusz had worked together.

You would have thought they had
worked together for 20 years.

We shot two camera tests
that he just liked a lot, and that was it.

Arthur Max put it together super simple.

creepy vibe.

WOLSKl: We just completely improvised
something with whatever.

When we're working,
with the scenes and the costumes...

it's like he knows what he wants.

1166
01:07:47,856 --> 01:07:51,358
But he's very open at the same time,
so if l come up with something...

1167
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:54,153
...he's always ready to kind of try that
and think about it.

1168
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:58,240
So it really felt like
we were finding her look together.

1169
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:01,034
And this mission, it's very practical...

1170
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:04,455
...so l wanted to have hair
that we didn't need to fix.

1171
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:05,873
She hadn't done anything.

1172
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:09,877
So if we can get to that with the blond one
as well, that's really good.

01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,128
-I agree.
-But it's kind of--

...Vickers, yeah.

01:08:20,889 --> 01:08:26,143
So it was a balance between finding
something that was quite soft...

1179
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:30,063
...but not hardcore or boyish
or masculine.

the fantastic hairdresser we have...

1182
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:38,906
...she brought so many different wigs
and she had one red.

1183
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,241
I was like, "Wow, well, but maybe not."

1184
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:44,161
And Ridley saw it and he was like,
"No, l don't think so. Not red."

1185
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:48,540
And then we popped it on and he was like:
"Oh, wow, yeah." Ha-ha-ha.

1186
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:49,750
The red looks really good.

Her whole persona
with this red hair that she has...

1188
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,425
...is a completely different persona
to had she been blond.

1189
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:00,093
So it did have an impact.

1190
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:03,305
Just really more the linear function
of her clothing.

1191
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:07,142
She's got long lines
and she's got functionality...

1192

that there's either an alternative agenda...

01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:46,630
It's like sharkskin silver, gray, shiny.

1269
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:50,258
This suit was fitted
to an inch of my body.

1270
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,844
But there was something about
putting the jacket on...

1271
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:56,056
...that almost, like, made me feel like
I was throwing my back out...

1272
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:59,893
...because when I put it on,
it just kind of sucked me into this posture...

1273
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,478
...that just became Vickers.

1274
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:05,982
And I would put this jacket on
and it was just like Vickers just came alive.

MAN:
Fourteen Charlie, take two, A mark.

1276

SCOTT: The male housekeeper
onboard the ship is called David.

1277
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:15,826
He is a creation
of the Weyland Corporation.

1278
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:21,164
We don't hide the fact, because Alien 1,
you know, had a character in there...

1279
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:23,667
...who was played by Ian Holm...

1280
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:26,586
...and at that moment,
he was a hidden agenda of the company.

1281
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:31,508
So I thought rather than hide the fact,
it'll be more fun while everyone's sleeping...

1282
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:35,470
...for this number of--
The distance that this ship will take...

1283
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:38,515
...David will be there
keeping an eye on things.

1284
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:44,855
I'm king of the world.

1285
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:49,609
SCOTT: One of the best actors we've got
out there right now is Michael Fassbender.

1286
01:14:49,777 --> 01:14:51,695
And I just point-blank asked him.

1287
01:14:51,863 --> 01:14:54,906
And he read the script and point-blank
said yes and that was it.

1288
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:57,993
My only instruction to Michael
I think was l said:

1289
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,204
"You know, in essence you're a servant."

1290
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:07,127
So his combination
of that massive mental capability...

1291
01:15:07,295 --> 01:15:09,087
...at the same time as having
to be servile...

1292
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:11,131
...gives rise for some actually
pretty humorous--

1293
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:13,508
I think he's quite humorous.

1294
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,635
FASSBENDER:
What l was really wanting to work...

1295
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:17,721
...with David as well
is the ambiguity about him.

1296
01:15:17,889 --> 01:15:20,724
I want him to be like that guy
that's so annoying, you know.

1297
01:15:20,892 --> 01:15:23,184
Like, "ls he taking the piss out of me
or being for real?"

1298
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:27,564
And I always want that. It's like
you don't know with him what's going on.

1299
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:30,400
That sort of ambiguity you want to have
with the audience as well...

1300
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:32,319
...where they're not sure, you know.

1301
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:37,282
"ls there an agenda? Has this robot got,
you know, human feelings?"

1302
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:42,287
So just trying to sort of
address all the areas correctly.

1303
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:45,332
Michael Fassbender's one of
the best actors l've ever worked with.

1304
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:49,044
He has an immediate access
to things that takes...

1305
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:52,339
...on a good day, hours for most actors.

1306
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:55,634
And in a not-so-good day, months...

1307
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:59,846
...for other actors.
He has just a real raw talent.

1308
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:02,641
-Got it. Genius. Now cut.
-Ha-ha-ha.

How long?

1311
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:11,816
Sixteen inches, fully erect.
It varies when it's relaxed.

1312
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,694
-Let's get--
-Where would you like me, over here?

1313
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,989
-I'd like you to remove your pants first.
-Certainly.

1319
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,963
FASSBENDER:
There's a very easy relationship on set.

1320
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:36,174
Everybody's having fun
and sort of getting on with it.

What do you need it for? Bypass surgery.

[ALL LAUGHING]

1323
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:45,100
There is a young, fresh cast,
but then we've also got...

1324
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:49,854
...you know, heavy sort of Oscar-winners.
Sort of, Charlize Theron.

1325
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:53,525
And she plays Vickers,
who's like this coldhearted bitch.

1326
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:58,571
And she's not very nice to David either.
I don't think anyone really is.

1327
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:02,742
Basically we wanted that sort of
immaculate, blond side-parting...

1328
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:05,078
...and evertyhing is so precise with him.

1329
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:09,582
In terms of his outfit, Janty
came up with a very sort of totalitarian...

1330
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:12,919
...sort of almost fascist-type
sort of uniform...

1331
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,588
...you know, where everything is just so
and in place.

1332
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:22,554
YATES: He was actually going to be barefoot,
because why would he need anything?

1333
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:26,891
But because of the line in the script
that he gets into a space suit...

1334
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:32,397
...and he does conform
to the normal human apparel...

1335
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:35,775
...we just kept him down to very fine lines.
Very--

1336
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:41,072
Again, the linear look,
which matches his character, really.

1337
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,284
Just jackets that are all-in-one,
trouble-free.

1338
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:49,414
And in the end,
we used the flip-flop option.

1339
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,834
LlNDELOF: I feel like most of
the coolness of David...

1340
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:57,047
...really was evoked by
Fassbender's previous work.

1341
01:17:57,214 --> 01:18:00,091
As opposed to me saying,
"This is what it's gonna be."

1342
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:04,137
Because him playing that role
as a synthetic human...

1343
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:07,974
...just opened all these other creative doors
and was just the greatest thing ever...

1344
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:10,810
...so it's almost like the words
that are coming out of his mouth...

1345
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:12,979
...don't even feel like
they're words that l wrote.

1346
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:16,191
They're just words that Fassbender
was whispering in my ear...

1347
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:18,985
...as l was typing on my computer.

1348

Janek, l'd worked with once before
on American Gangster.

1351
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:34,667
Idris Elba.
And Idris, l'd always admired his stuff.

1352
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:37,337
I need a strong guy,
a guy who could fly the ship.

1353
01:18:37,505 --> 01:18:39,506
I'd believe him, l'd buy him...

1354
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:45,345
...into being probably ex-pilot
of some kind before he joined up...

1355
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:48,723
...with the Weyland Corporation
where he did a few long hauls.

1356
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:51,893
Fortunately for me, he said yes,
so I was thrilled to bits.

1357
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:57,190
And he evolves
right through the three acts...

1358
01:18:57,358 --> 01:19:01,611
...finally turning himself into a bomb
which will bring down the juggernaut.

1359
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:05,365
The set of characters in this film
is kind of vast.

1360
01:19:05,533 --> 01:19:08,618
I think Ridley's put together
an interesting set of cast.

1361
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:10,370
You watch these people,
you believe them.

1362
01:19:10,538 --> 01:19:16,626
And Ridley's very good at directing
these actors to seem like a team.

1363
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:18,128
Or not.

1364
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:22,257
FASSBENDER: Then you've got Rafe Spall
and Sean Harris...

1365
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,552
...two English actors
who l was aware of their work.

1366
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:27,929
And they're just great guys.
They make a great pair.

1367
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:31,683
I think they're gonna be, again, bringing
a lot of comedy element to the film.

1368
01:19:31,851 --> 01:19:36,938
And also just the dynamic between them
is very organic and very loose.

1369
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:38,731
And that's the great thing about Ridley.

1370
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:42,527
He allows you to go off-page, stay on-page,
do whatever you want, really.

1371
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:45,238
And if it works, it works.
If it doesn't, it doesn't.

1372
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:47,532
You know, and there's no pressure.

1373
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:50,910
Then we've got Kate Dickie,
who is in Red Road.

1374
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:53,413
I saw her, she blew me away in that film.

1375
01:19:53,581 --> 01:19:57,876
Every morning we have to insert
Michael Fassbender's head onto his body...

1376
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:01,254
...in order to get him to perform.

1377
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:03,548
Every night he goes home
and his bloody head falls off.

1378
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:06,217
I always forget, my creator.

1379
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:09,804
Yeah, Guy's a blast. l mean,
we just sort of end up telling jokes all day.

Bathing his feet.
I think that was my most fun day.

01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:21,441
...two Pygmies waiting in your room, sir,

01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:23,776
-Only two?
-That's all I could find.

1386
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:27,655
Like, "l have the two Pygmies
and three Brazilian swimwear models...

1387
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:30,909
...waiting in your room, sir."
And he's like, "Only two Pygmies?" Ha-ha.

He's very easy to work with.
He's a consummate professional.

that sarcastic attitude.

you know...

1396
01:20:56,644 --> 01:20:59,229
...Edison, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.

He's the billionaire megalomaniac.

1398
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:05,318
He's a man who thinks outside
of the square.

1399
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:09,781
And a lot of people do that in life,
but a lot of people don't have the facility...

1400
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:12,492
...or the finance to be able to
actually act on that.

1401
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:18,498
I believe that he feels that we've gotten
so close, that we're getting closer...

1402
01:21:18,666 --> 01:21:22,252
...that it's actually possible to discover
who it is that actually created us.

1403
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:25,672
You know, the process
that I had to go through was...

1404
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:29,259
...quite a lot of prosthetic makeup
in order to look as old--

1405
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,928
You know, it was basically
around about the 1 00-year mark.

1406
01:21:32,096 --> 01:21:37,976
So it was important to find a way
to make that look as realistic as possible.

1407
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:42,188
Which, you know, the Prosthetics team
did an incredible job...

1408
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:45,233
...but it takes five hours
in a makeup chair to get it there.

1409
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:48,069
I was a lot younger when
I first sat down in this makeup chair.

[LAUGHlNG]

1411
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:53,533
Just an indication of how bloody long
we've been sitting here.

1412
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:56,786
PEARCE: The difficult thing about playing
somebody who's a lot older than yourself...

1413
01:21:56,954 --> 01:22:00,456
...is that people know how old l am,
they know what I look like...

1414
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:02,500
...so there's always gonna
be scrutiny anyway.

1415
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:04,627
I'm just hiding myself away.

1416
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:06,546
I mean, I remember saying to Ridley:

1417
01:22:06,714 --> 01:22:09,674
"Why aren't you just casting
some old bloke?"

1418
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:13,511
But it was important for him at the time
to find somebody...

1419
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,849
...who sort of had a youthful quality,
I suppose, that comes through.

1420
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:22,478
And then once I talk about David being
in the room, maybe l can wander forward.

1421
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:26,316
PEARCE: But at the same time, manage
something that was seemingly realistic.

1422
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:27,775

YATES:
How l started with Prometheus...

1425
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:48,755
...was really by
vast quantities of research.

1426
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:52,258
And it just all screamed to me:

1427
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:55,678
"Prototype, prototype, prototype,
as soon as possible."

1428
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:58,931
Ridley was quite adamant
that he wanted to avoid...

1429
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:04,729
...the puffy space suit
that is really a NASA space suit.

1430
01:23:05,773 --> 01:23:09,817
SCOTT: lt can't be too bulky.
It's gotta be practical. They have to be athletic.

1431
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,487
By then, they won't be
walking around in suits...

1432
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:16,115
...which are this fat and this thick
to keep them warm.

1433
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:21,913
You'll have such an evolution of capabilities
by then, they'll probably be skintight.

1434
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:28,002
He loved the skinny look of the NASA
undersuits which in the '60s were silver.

1435
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:31,089
And he loved that look,
the very linear look.

1436
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:34,300
It was more interesting, really.
More technical.

1437
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:38,388
And plus it gave the actors
a lot more chance to be mobile.

1438
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:42,975
Under the space suit,
which has basically two layers...

1439
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:45,812
...there is a neoprene under-undersuit.

1440
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:49,148

[GRUNTS]

1442
01:23:53,320 --> 01:24:00,034
YATES: And it's a form of a biosuit, airprene,
which is a neoprene which breathes.

1443
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:02,286
So the actors would never get hot.

1444
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:07,083
And we were able to buy
this amazing neoprene from Taiwan...

1445
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:09,168
...with a beautiful pattern on it.

1446
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:12,922
And then all the tubes
that monitor the blood...

1447
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:16,801
...that monitor the oxygen levels,
that monitor your heart rate...

1448
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:21,973
...were attached in an orange tubing
around the body.

1449
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:24,016
And so it's quite a thing of beauty.

1450
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:25,852
SCOTT:
Action!

1451
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:30,022
I'm so excited because the neoprene ones
are the ones with all the orange.

1452
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:32,108
You know, the rubber ones.

1453
01:24:32,276 --> 01:24:35,153
They don't get seen that often.
They're supposed to go under our blue.

1454
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:40,533
And they are just beautifully beautiful,
molded, amazing.

1455
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:43,995
SCOTT: l figured by then,
you'll put a bubble on your head.

1456
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:47,373
Why are you gonna create a helmet
where you've got blind spots?

1457
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:48,708
That's ridiculous.

1458
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:51,711
When you wanna do that,
you really want a globe...

1459
01:24:51,879 --> 01:24:55,923
...because the plastic by then
will be absolutely bulletproof.

1460
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,385
You're gonna have a helmet
which has no blind spots at all.

1461
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:03,931
And in that helmet, they've got
video screens this big, like postage stamps.

1462
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:08,853
Each one works, so in there, he can look at,
you know, Fifield and Millburn.

1463
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:12,231
If they wanna talk to him,
he can glance at them to see them.

1464
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:16,235
Around his neck will be all this technology
which will whisper in his ear all the time.

01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:18,654
YATES:
To start with the helmet...

1466
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:24,869
...the globe was very specific to Ridley's
design, which is egg-shaped...

1467
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:31,250
...which is more oval
than any other globe or dome...

1468
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:34,754
...that I've seen on a helmet before.

1469
01:25:34,922 --> 01:25:37,590
And integral into that helmet...

1470
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:42,428
...are nine working video screens...

1471
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:45,681
...X amount of tech
being played on them.

1472
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:48,851
What we've got here
is our kind of basic shells...

1473
01:25:49,019 --> 01:25:54,899
...being fitted up with their
internal dashboards and LCD screens...

1474
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:59,487
...and all the associated electronics
that drive the screens in here...

cameraman so he can light the face.

that had to be installed.

PEARMAlN: Also there are some effects
we can have on there...

1479
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:17,296

on their faces.

presence of the Weyland logo.

They also have trousers
that are very overstitched.

And they have jackets
which have a lot of overstitching.

The background
of the Prometheus patch...

1494
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:17,607
...is based on Prometheus,
the fallen angel...

...and he has his wings outspread...

1496

hoping to get back.

about winning an Oscar all the time.

was being prepared on a rolling basis.

01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,847
And for a movie of this scale
and this level of design, that was terrifying.

You walk onto a set, and the set's there,
it's there. It's not a green screen or anything.

me away immediately are the sets on this film.

...I think is evertyhing.

England was the attractive place
because it was 20 percent on spend.

1529

So it's a great tax rebate.

And also, working with the English crews
is kind of nice. You know, it's good fun.

Go and have a cup of tea,
just keep the operators here.

That set is--

1540
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:30,633
I've never worked on this
since l did Legend.

is 40 percent longer...

1542
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:35,971
...than H stage at Shepperton.

1543
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:40,309
So I fundamentally booked
the Bond stage for 1 0 months.

1544
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:41,936
And five other stages.

1545
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:44,772
So we had-- And we also had the backlot.

1546
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:54,240
Enough of a backlot to do
some pretty marvelous stuff...

...from the belly of the Prometheus.

01:30:57,202 --> 01:31:00,621
You've got this garage
which lowers itself down.

1549

It's, like, almost hangar-sized.

1550
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:06,085
Out of which the ATVs come
and the buses...

...which take our people onto the planet.

ELLENBERG: We were green-lit, basically,
at the end of October...

1554
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:23,686
...and we were shooting it, you know,
third week of March.

1555
01:31:23,854 --> 01:31:26,981
With nothing built. Zero.

1556
01:31:27,148 --> 01:31:29,233
We had designed a lot,
so that was great...

1557
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:30,943
...but we had built nothing.

1558
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:33,737
Because we only had that five months,
it was a madcap process...

1559
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:37,366
...where every set would be done, struck,
and we'd start the next one...

1560
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:40,452
...and have that ready five or six days prior
and onto the next.

1561
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:42,580
So for a massive epic movie like this...

1562
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:48,335
...it was done with a degree of factory
precision that was remarkable.

1563
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:53,173
HUFFAM: Our actual prep time from when
we got the actual go-ahead to filming...

1564
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,759
...was short for this scale of film.

1565
01:31:55,927 --> 01:32:00,264
So we were having to get it all done
under a huge pressure of time.

1566
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:04,184
Also here, in London, it's very, very busy.

1567
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:07,438
Stage space availability
was not good for us.

1568
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:12,484
So every stage we've worked on has not
had to just work for one set...

1569
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:16,530
...it's, at a minimum, had to work for two
and often had to work for three.

MAX: The Bond stage is the biggest stage
in Europe.

1571
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:24,204
Still wasn't big enough for us
because we had a lot to get into them.

1572
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:30,294
And so we decided to extend it by about
another third as long.

1573
01:32:31,254 --> 01:32:35,007
This is one of those sets
where size does matter.

1574
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:38,135
And I'm sure Ridley would say it's big,
but it's not big enough.

1575
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:39,887
We had a lot to get into them.

1576
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:45,559
We built a roof over the entryway
and created a stage within a stage.

1577
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:51,607
That's because we had to combine
the interior of the pyramid structure...

1578
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:56,320
...we had to have chambers and corridors
suggesting that scale...

1579
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:59,031
...combined with the interior
of the juggernaut...

1580
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:04,328
...which is basically a ship similar
to the crashed derelict ship...

1581
01:33:04,496 --> 01:33:08,832
...the croissant ship of the first movie.

1582
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,336
Additional 1 50 feet
was very, very beneficial...

1583
01:33:12,504 --> 01:33:15,172
...because that's the entrance
to this cave.

1584
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:18,676
We had to be very careful about
how we used the space...

1585
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:21,261
...because there was never gonna be
enough space...

1586
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:24,723
...because the juggernaut was enormous
in scale...

1587
01:33:24,891 --> 01:33:28,352
...compared to the Prometheus.
More than twice as big.

1588
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:31,522
And so we had to figure out
how we could combine...

1589
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:34,608
...with digital extension
and 3D modeling...

1590
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:37,361
...how we could create
that sense of scale.

1591
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:41,824
SCOTT: l designed the Bond stage with Arthur
as a massive complex...

1592
01:33:41,992 --> 01:33:46,286
...from the minute you walk into
what I describe as the hives...

1593
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:48,414
...they're kind of domes.

1594
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:51,625
And because l was always going for scale,
evertyhing was big.

1595
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:55,796
So the Bond stage was chalk to chalk.
It was jammed.

1596
01:33:55,964 --> 01:33:59,508
KEENE: We got four or five big sets,
all vying for space.

1597
01:33:59,676 --> 01:34:02,553
There is no space left in there.
There's barely enough space for the crew.

1598
01:34:03,263 --> 01:34:04,722
[BELL RINGS]

1599
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:07,307
MAN:
Rolling.

1600
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:09,184
KEENE:
We're always fighting each other...

1601
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:11,770
...trying to find a little corner
to put a certain monitor.

1602
01:34:11,938 --> 01:34:14,523
A little corner to put your table
full of equipment.

1603
01:34:14,691 --> 01:34:18,485
Let's start getting everybody out of the way
who doesn't need to be here.

1604
01:34:18,987 --> 01:34:22,406
LlNDELOF: The first set that l went onto was
the interior of the ship.

1605
01:34:22,574 --> 01:34:26,160
Of the Prometheus. So the science lab
had been built and a number of corridors.

1606
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:29,413
And I walked into video village
and Ridley was just sitting there...

1607
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:33,208
...with 3D glasses on
and there were six HD screens.

1608
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:35,586
Each one of them had
a different camera.

1609
01:34:35,754 --> 01:34:37,046
I looked at them and I was like:

1610
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:40,507
"Oh, my God, like,
this is actually happening."

1611
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:54,104
FASSBENDER: Walking around the spaceship,
you feel like you're walking on a spaceship.

1612
01:34:54,272 --> 01:34:57,149
The Art Department and the carpenters
and all the guys that have...

1613
01:34:57,317 --> 01:35:00,944
...put the work in have done
a really stunning job.

1614
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:05,032
Mm.

1615
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:08,952
ELLlOTT: On the first day we walked onto set,
I think there was a mutual feeling...

1616
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:12,289
...of we were on the ship and--
You've all seen the film...

1617
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:14,708
...so this was kind of daunting.

1618
01:35:14,876 --> 01:35:18,629
You know, we're about to do the first take
and we're now about to do...

1619
01:35:18,797 --> 01:35:21,048
...the prequel of Alien.

1620
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:23,175
SCOTT:
And action.

1621
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:25,219
ELLlOTT:
But after that first scene...

1622
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:28,263
...everyone establishes who they are
and we just kind of get on with it.

1623
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:29,473
MAN:
B mark.

1624
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:33,894
WONG: He chose a scene where we had all just
woken up out of two years of hyper-sleep.

1625
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:38,273
So we're all a bit spaced out anyways.
So I guess that really worked.

1626
01:35:38,441 --> 01:35:41,652
And in some respects, we didn't really
know each other, as well.

1627
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:44,071
So, you know, the way they he planned it
was perfect.

1628
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:45,489
MAN:
Marker.

1629
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,449
Is this seat taken?

1630
01:35:47,617 --> 01:35:52,454
And that was thrilling because, you know,
for all of us, we've grown up with Alien.

1631
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:57,793
The idea of working with Ridley Scott
and then to come onto the set...

1632
01:35:57,961 --> 01:36:02,005
...on the first day and to be
on the spaceship was unbelievable.

1633
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:03,924
So there was like 1 5 of us.

1634
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:07,010
He wanted to do a thing where we were
all queuing up and getting our food.

1635
01:36:07,178 --> 01:36:09,471
And he was like, "Okay, no rehearsal.

1636
01:36:09,639 --> 01:36:12,641
Let's just get three cameras on this,
see what happens."

1637
01:36:17,063 --> 01:36:19,356
My fingers are still numb.

1638
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:22,901
And then I've never been out
this long before, so....

1639
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:25,904
-No one's been out that long before.
-Right.

1640
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:28,532
That was thrilling. That was like,
"We're in the Alien film."

1641
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:32,202
You know, I mean, this is Ridley, you know,
so that was really, really cool and exciting.

1642
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:33,996
That was the first day. It was brilliant.

1643
01:36:34,164 --> 01:36:35,372
MAN 1 : Cut it.
MAN 2: Cut it.

1644
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:38,041
We broke for lunch and Michael Ellenberg
said to me:

1645
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:42,212
"Let's go over to one of the other stages,"
where essentially they had built....

1646
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:45,632
In the script, it was originally called
the ampule room.

1647
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,343
There is no green screen.
They just built it.

1648
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:52,764
This entire stage had basically been
transformed into an alien world.

1649
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:54,641
I got tears in my eyes. I was like:

1650
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,560
[GASPS]

1651
01:36:57,061 --> 01:37:01,064
Because it's almost like a piece of art.

1652
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:06,069
With sci-fi movies, and it's out in space,
and a lot of technique...

1653
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:11,408
...and you can kind of lose the beauty.
And you can kind of lose reality.

1654
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:14,578
But l think Ridley is totally unique.

1655
01:37:14,746 --> 01:37:17,539
The whole design and the costumes
and evertyhing...

1656
01:37:17,707 --> 01:37:21,376
...is really beautiful in a very cruel way.

1657
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:24,630
And it helped me so much
because you don't have to pretend then.

1658
01:37:24,797 --> 01:37:26,340
It's a short way into it.

1659
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:29,509
SCOTT: Speed up the entrance a little bit
all around.

1660
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:32,387
SHAW:
Stop. Don't touch it.

1661
01:37:32,555 --> 01:37:35,557
WOOD: Ampules come alive
in the middle of the set.

1662
01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:38,101
We're gonna do a dozen, actually...

1663
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:43,232
...of practical and not a visual effect.
And it's basically corn starch and water...

1664
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:45,234
...with a vibration underneath it.

1665
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:49,238
Inside, you've got a container
that's gonna have the fluid in it...

1666
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:53,242
...that distributes it from the middle
container out to the outside.

1667
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:55,869
And that comes from a large reservoir
off set.

1668
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:59,915
The cover goes on the top and,
at a certain point...

1669
01:38:00,083 --> 01:38:04,461
...to the director's discretion,
a little air ram pushes the lid up a little bit...

1670
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:08,840
...and black fluid will ooze down the side
as well as the effect that you've got...

1671
01:38:09,008 --> 01:38:11,134
...on the top of the ampule.

1672
01:38:12,178 --> 01:38:15,973
SCOTT: We built more set
than you might build, normally.

1673
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:19,226
Because, I think, it worked out
economically better...

1674
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:21,895
...than actually saying,
"Well, let's have this green screen.

1675
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:26,608
We can do evertyhing digitally."
Digitally is not cheaper.

Sometimes you can see the wires.

1678
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:32,072
You know, you can see the science fiction...

1679
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,116
...in a lot of movies that are made today...

1680
01:38:34,284 --> 01:38:37,786
...because the actors are doing it
in front of a green screen.

1681
01:38:37,954 --> 01:38:40,998
As much as they're being told
what is happening around them...

1682
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:45,836
...you know, they're not attaching
the thought to that environment.

1683
01:38:46,004 --> 01:38:48,005
I mean, they're acting in a void.

1684
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:50,549
Which l think
is always horrendously difficult...

1685
01:38:50,717 --> 01:38:52,509
...both for the actor
as well as the director.

1686
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:53,677
MAN:

1687
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:55,220
MARSHALL-GREEN:
In this case...

1688
01:38:55,388 --> 01:38:57,848
...we have the luxury
of evertyhing is there on the day.

1689
01:38:58,016 --> 01:39:02,644
And we can attach the thought
to exactly what's going to be seen.

1690
01:39:02,812 --> 01:39:05,647
KEENE: So for an outsider to look at the way
we make the movie...

1691
01:39:05,815 --> 01:39:07,190
...would be pretty comical.

1692
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:10,652
You've got a 7'6" guy
covered in red dots...

1693
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:12,946
...and it's purely so
that they can track him...

1694
01:39:13,114 --> 01:39:15,657
...and create a computer-generated
version of it later.

1695
01:39:15,825 --> 01:39:18,368
But at least we have something practical
to play with on the day.

1696
01:39:19,037 --> 01:39:20,412
And that's great for us.

1697
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:23,874
It's much better than, you know,
having to just imagine everything.

1698
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:28,211
SCOTT:
It's the terrible twins. Wow.

1699
01:39:29,047 --> 01:39:31,340
Hmm. lntimidating, right?

-Perfectly normal.

01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:47,856
FASSBENDER: I love that.
SCOTT: Look at the skin.

1707
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:50,901
He's got-- The veins are painted in.
It's beautiful.

1708
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:55,113
FASSBENDER: Ridley seems to like very much
the idea of building it and having it there...

1709
01:39:55,281 --> 01:39:57,449
...so everything is sort of viable.

1710
01:39:57,617 --> 01:40:01,036
The texture of everything is there to touch,
to sort of interact with.

1711
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:04,414
That's the thing, watching him, you can see
the texture and the feel of things...

1712
01:40:04,582 --> 01:40:06,208
...is very important to him.

1713
01:40:06,376 --> 01:40:09,878
Do we need this many people here, guys?
Get behind the cameras. Move, move.

1714
01:40:10,046 --> 01:40:12,422
Anyone not doing anything,
move down that corridor.

1715
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:16,093
-Where's the gap that that can go in?
-There are holes all over it. Keep probing.

1716
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:20,764
DlCKlE: You're getting to see real, live things
in front of you.

1717
01:40:20,932 --> 01:40:22,891
And things like the head exploding.

1718
01:40:23,059 --> 01:40:28,271
When we take an Engineer's head back and
open it and it turns out that's not his head.

1719
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:31,149
We open it up and inside is this head.

1720
01:40:31,317 --> 01:40:33,443
Well, then, l thought on the day
that they would say:

1721
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:35,070
"Okay, now you're gonna
imagine this."

1722
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:37,072
But they had
the whole Animatronics Department.

1723
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:41,743
So this head was literally twitching,
and mouth-shaking...

1724
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:45,789
...and blood-oozing,
and veins throbbing, and....

1725
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:52,337
So as an actor, it's a dream because
you just can react to what's in front of you.

1726
01:40:52,505 --> 01:40:54,297
That shook you, didn't it?

1732
01:41:16,863 --> 01:41:20,490
...everything comes
research and development on the job.

1733
01:41:20,658 --> 01:41:25,412
There's nothing that existed beforehand.
Everything's been generated from scratch.

1734
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:28,331
From Ridley's imagination,

I'd have three or four big, big 3D monitors.

1779

I'm actually editing 3D.

It helped having Dariusz Wolski.

1783
01:43:56,939 --> 01:44:00,108
WOLSKl: What's necessary for 3D
is that when you have four rigs...

1784
01:44:00,443 --> 01:44:03,987
...I had to have an instant switch
to watch eight cameras...

1785
01:44:04,155 --> 01:44:07,490
...which is left eye, right eye of every rig
at every time, 2D.

1786
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:11,995
Because that monitors my lighting
and monitors if the lenses are in focus.

1787
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:18,376
And all this stuff has to be rigged
to the stereo card.

1788
01:44:18,544 --> 01:44:21,463
And then everything has to be fed back
to the video playback.

1789
01:44:21,631 --> 01:44:27,135
And that has to come back to two big 3D
monitors that Ridley's watching next to me.

1790
01:44:28,095 --> 01:44:31,514
And for 2D monitors, you can watch
four cameras at the same time.

1791
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:34,351
But also he wants to-- He can switch
from one camera to another.

1792
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:37,103
So that requires a lot of cable.

1793

And a lot of very, very, very intricate
wiring.

The 3D element is a big factor.

it's a slower process.

more time to your schedule...

1812
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:43,753
And Ridley likes to shoot with three or four
cameras simultaneously.

1813
01:45:43,921 --> 01:45:47,841
So you're in small sets with a lot
of cameras taking up a lot of spaces...

ELLENBERG: I think the biggest surprise,
in a really pleasurable way for them...

1825
01:46:24,336 --> 01:46:29,132

and big landscapes, the 3D was fine.

1826

But where they really were excited by it,
and really, l think, it started to change...

1827
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:34,971
...sort of some of their choices
in the movie...

1828
01:46:35,139 --> 01:46:39,100
...was in the smaller, more intimate scenes
on the interiors of the ship...

1829
01:46:39,268 --> 01:46:43,980
...because it opened up sets, it gave them
a lot of different options to play with.

1830
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:46,065
It gave them the opportunity
to make the scares...

1831
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:47,942
...that much bigger
and pop that much more.

that's happening, so just do it."

of animated shots almost...

1894
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:03,471

as an actor, you have so many tools.

my father...

When are we getting to it?"

1902
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:29,622
"Ridley's still just trying to get
some of the images for you...

1903

...so that we can throw it on the monitor
for you to really see."

And I was just like, "Who does that?"

1905

So many other directors would just be like,
"This is your job."

Like, "Bring me emotion."

There it is. Imagine--"

We were able to bring that arm above,
lower it down...

and it was dangling from the arm...

2219
02:06:47,850 --> 02:06:50,769
...waiting to be born, as it were, or freed...

2220
02:06:50,937 --> 02:06:55,148
...that was achieved by bursting that sac.

2221
02:06:55,316 --> 02:06:58,443
Actually, it was burst
using a very, very sharp razor...

2222
02:06:58,611 --> 02:07:00,654
...which will have been removed
in postproduction.

2223
02:07:00,822 --> 02:07:02,990
And that allowed the sac
to instantly burst...

2224
02:07:03,157 --> 02:07:05,951
...and spew all of this sort of fluid.

2225
02:07:06,369 --> 02:07:08,745
The first thing we had to do
is to get the creature inside.

2226
02:07:08,913 --> 02:07:11,999
And to get the creature inside,
we had to roll it up in a certain way.

2227
02:07:12,166 --> 02:07:15,502
It was a little bit like origami.
We had to find the right way to fold him...

2228
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:18,839
...so that we could guarantee that
on every shot he would look the same.

2229
02:07:19,007 --> 02:07:21,508
That was then introduced into the condom.

2230
02:07:21,676 --> 02:07:25,971
And then into the condom,
we then added the fluid...

2231
02:07:26,139 --> 02:07:29,516
...and all the other little bits of skin
and evertyhing else.

2232
02:07:29,684 --> 02:07:32,519
At the same time, we had to continue
to draw on the condom...

2233
02:07:32,687 --> 02:07:34,354
...and get it as tight as we could.

2234
02:07:34,522 --> 02:07:39,026
The tighter it was, the more violent
the release and more beautiful it was.

becomes completely clear with liquid.

-I think you need more of this.

John Hurt got off lately, didn't he?

They have done such an amazing job,
so it felt--

2249
02:08:26,574 --> 02:08:29,493
I almost started to believe
in the situation...

2250
02:08:29,660 --> 02:08:33,080
...and forgot l was hanging and everybody were
in a situation with my feet down there.

2251
02:08:33,581 --> 02:08:36,416
I saw my feet, you know, on the dummy,
and I was like:

2252
02:08:36,584 --> 02:08:37,667
"Why can't l move my feet?"

2253
02:08:38,086 --> 02:08:40,504
Because it's--
Because it really felt like me.

2254
02:08:40,671 --> 02:08:43,006
I think I had my hand on her breast...

2255
02:08:43,174 --> 02:08:45,801
...and I was sort of hand-on-breast
talking to Noomi...

2256
02:08:45,968 --> 02:08:50,222
...and someone in the monitor shouted,
"This isn't right." Ha-ha-ha.

2257
02:08:50,389 --> 02:08:52,265
This really isn't right,
and then you realize...

2258
02:08:52,433 --> 02:08:55,936
...when you look at the monitor
that it didn't look right.

2259
02:08:56,104 --> 02:09:00,065
Inside all the tentacles
are a series of discs...

2260
02:09:00,233 --> 02:09:03,276
...and each stage has a number of cables,
normally four...

2261
02:09:03,444 --> 02:09:05,779
...that give it left, right,
up and down motion.

2262
02:09:05,947 --> 02:09:07,572
So by stacking them together...

2263
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:11,076
...you can get what's called an S-shape
or a complete curl.

2264
02:09:11,244 --> 02:09:15,789
So all in all, there was about,
I would have thought, 60 or 70 cables...

2265
02:09:15,957 --> 02:09:21,128
...running to the tentacles
through the body of the creature.

2266
02:09:21,295 --> 02:09:24,339
They were connected
to a series of servo motors.

2267
02:09:24,507 --> 02:09:27,926
The servo motors
replaced the human operators.

2268
02:09:28,094 --> 02:09:32,472
And the whole system is then operated
through a remote-control system.

2269
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:37,435
Effectively, a number ofjoysticks, using
what we call electronic expression makers...

2270
02:09:37,603 --> 02:09:41,606
...allows one or two people
to mix all of those motors together...

2271
02:09:41,774 --> 02:09:43,650
...in a predetermined fashion.

2272
02:09:43,818 --> 02:09:46,486
So that when they move the joystick
in one particular way...

2273
02:09:46,654 --> 02:09:47,946
...they'll get one expression.

2274
02:09:48,114 --> 02:09:49,823
They move it in another,
they'll get another.

2275
02:09:49,991 --> 02:09:54,369
And by moving between those different
motions, you can get a whole array...

2276
02:09:54,537 --> 02:09:58,373
...of different sort of activities
out of the creature.

2277
02:09:58,541 --> 02:10:00,667
The big decision is--
Blood is red, obviously.

2278
02:10:00,835 --> 02:10:02,210
Do you go red?

2279
02:10:02,378 --> 02:10:03,628
As soon as you go red...

2280
02:10:03,796 --> 02:10:07,007
...then the blood stakes
immediately go much, much higher...

2281
02:10:07,175 --> 02:10:09,843
...than if you choose
an alternative color.

2282
02:10:10,011 --> 02:10:12,596
If we used ambers,
if we used milky solutions...

2283
02:10:13,264 --> 02:10:18,185
...all of those things can be quite
off-putting and are obviously unpleasant...

2284
02:10:18,352 --> 02:10:19,519
...but it's not bleeding.

2285
02:10:19,937 --> 02:10:23,273
So we decided we'd take
two approaches with Ridley.

2286
02:10:23,441 --> 02:10:24,774
One was that everything we did...

2287
02:10:24,942 --> 02:10:29,696
...we did as an amber
or a milky or a clear take...

2288
02:10:29,864 --> 02:10:32,824
...and then we'd have our second version,
which was blood red.

2289
02:10:33,701 --> 02:10:37,454
And in many ways with blood,
you can never not have enough.

02:10:46,255 --> 02:10:48,715
...and I think that you get
one or two conservative takes...

you open up the floodgates.

or eight years ago...

mold it, cast it, test it...

So with that hard form, we can go back,
we can polish everything.

We probably had a team of fabricators
working on the thing for six months.

the best possible design...

that we're using...

...is very used to wearing suits.

Welcome to my life.

2351
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:10,500
The surface of the suit is transparent...

2352
02:14:10,668 --> 02:14:13,545
...so it's got
like a translucent layer like skin.

2353

So that would be the difference between
the stunt suit and the hero suit.

2354
02:14:16,882 --> 02:14:19,050
The stunt suit would be more painted.

2355
02:14:19,218 --> 02:14:23,304
The hero suit actually had a cast skin,
transparent skin over it...

2356
02:14:23,472 --> 02:14:27,934

and made it look quite sort of squid-like.

When, you know-- In a bygone time
when there were no alternatives...

2366
02:15:01,510 --> 02:15:02,844
...that would have been the route.

2367
02:15:03,012 --> 02:15:05,597
But now with CG,
I think we all chose early on...

2368
02:15:05,764 --> 02:15:09,142
...that this was a character
that would be fantastic in CG.

2369
02:15:09,310 --> 02:15:13,646
So we only took the design
to a point of reference, really.

2370
02:15:13,814 --> 02:15:15,356
A finished point of reference...

2371
02:15:15,524 --> 02:15:18,568
...but we didn't go
into the finer details of things...

2372
02:15:18,736 --> 02:15:21,154
...like the certain elements
that existed on the tentacles...

2373
02:15:21,322 --> 02:15:22,655
...which we brought to life in CG.

2374
02:15:22,823 --> 02:15:25,325
Opening up
and seeing all the textures inside them.

2375
02:15:25,493 --> 02:15:30,079
We didn't do that. We chose
a much more sort of neutral look to it...

2376
02:15:30,247 --> 02:15:33,833
...but took it from the 2D
right away to a full sculpt...

2377
02:15:34,001 --> 02:15:35,168
...through the molding process.

2378
02:15:35,336 --> 02:15:38,505
It's sort of like the way through
which we finished artworking a character.

2379
02:15:38,839 --> 02:15:43,009
It was posable and moveable,
and we did use it in a few shots...

2380
02:15:43,177 --> 02:15:46,346
...but its real purpose, l think,
was to serve as a lighting...

2381
02:15:46,514 --> 02:15:49,849
...and a visual textual reference
for CG to take on and take from there.

2382

...for the sequence with the Engineer's
fight with the trilobite...

2392
02:16:16,043 --> 02:16:19,754
...we could use elements of the trilobite...

2393
02:16:19,922 --> 02:16:24,842

MAN 2: He's blocking the door.

2397
02:16:40,609 --> 02:16:43,570
Right, we need to knock this door off,
knock her somehow.

2398
02:16:43,737 --> 02:16:46,614
As Shaw's being attacked
by the Engineer...

2399
02:16:46,782 --> 02:16:52,078
...the trilobite is clearly becoming aware
of something happening behind the door.

2400
02:16:52,246 --> 02:16:55,248
We were using sound effects, l suppose,
as well as some visual effects...

2401
02:16:55,416 --> 02:16:58,376
...shadow effects,
as well as the odd glimpse...

2402

...of a tentacle passing across a window
or something like that.

2403
02:17:01,338 --> 02:17:03,923

in the background...

2413
02:17:24,612 --> 02:17:29,616
The med pod creature that came
from Sean and Holloway has grown.

2414
02:17:29,783 --> 02:17:31,326
It's impregnated the Engineer...

2415
02:17:31,493 --> 02:17:35,163
...and mixed the DNA of the Engineer
with that of the trilobite.

2416
02:17:35,331 --> 02:17:37,415
It gives us what we call the Deacon.

2417
02:17:37,583 --> 02:17:40,376
We started to sculpt that
as a full-sized sculpt.

2418
02:17:40,544 --> 02:17:42,420
Stood about 4 feet tall.

2419
02:17:42,588 --> 02:17:43,963
We built two versions of him.

2420
02:17:44,131 --> 02:17:46,299
We built one version
which went inside the sac...

2421
02:17:46,467 --> 02:17:49,093
...which was born out of the Engineer...

2422
02:17:49,261 --> 02:17:51,596
...and a second version,
which is what we call a rod puppet.

2423
02:17:51,764 --> 02:17:56,976
So the sequence begins with the Engineer
lying on the ground, dead.

2424
02:17:57,144 --> 02:18:00,938
The trilobite's crawled away
and died somewhere in the corner.

2425
02:18:01,106 --> 02:18:04,692
And the creature begins
to sort of want to liberate itself.

2426
02:18:04,860 --> 02:18:08,821
So the whole heaving of its body
on the ground was the first sign.

2427
02:18:09,239 --> 02:18:12,575
So we built a full-size Engineer,
and he was an animatronic.

2428
02:18:12,743 --> 02:18:14,827
Everything is weighted
and evertyhing is jointed...

2429
02:18:14,995 --> 02:18:17,664
...so that it will only move
in a way that we would move.

on the ground.

When the Deacon is born
from the Engineer...

2432
02:18:23,921 --> 02:18:26,839
...he's still connected to him
with his umbilical.

2433
02:18:27,007 --> 02:18:30,885
So his umbilical passes from the stomach
of the Deacon through the embryotic sac...

02:23:40,946 --> 02:23:42,780
...that we are insured to do...

2523
02:23:42,948 --> 02:23:47,201
...and so, you know,
I watched my stunt guy jump off the ATV...

2524
02:23:47,369 --> 02:23:51,080
...and I tried to make sure
I did it just as good if not better.

2525
02:23:52,708 --> 02:23:54,625
INCH:
They were tracked ATVs, difficult vehicles.

2526
02:23:54,793 --> 02:23:56,961
We had to jump it off a ramp and it would--

2527
02:23:57,337 --> 02:24:00,631
You know, one moment they would grip
one side and not the other...

2528
02:24:00,799 --> 02:24:03,509
...and so he did a little bit
but not a huge amount.

2529
02:24:05,804 --> 02:24:09,098
To me, that was the biggest
action sequence in it as a set piece.

2530
02:24:09,266 --> 02:24:11,475
As they were arriving back
from picking the head up...

2531
02:24:11,643 --> 02:24:14,270
...they jump off the back,
the head gets blown away.

2532
02:24:14,438 --> 02:24:16,522
So we would rehearse that
with our doubles.

2533
02:24:16,690 --> 02:24:19,483
Basically, she gets-- Stands down,
she gets jerked off the ground...

2534
02:24:19,651 --> 02:24:22,987
...and then she gets blown, tumbling down
towards this big stanchion...

2535
02:24:23,155 --> 02:24:25,364
...which is the leg of the main spaceship.

2536
02:24:25,532 --> 02:24:27,199
She gets pinned against that.

2537
02:24:27,367 --> 02:24:29,952
And then Holloway sees that,
comes out on his bike...

2538
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:33,247
...jumps off the edge of the ramp there,
gets-- Drives down to her...

2539
02:24:33,415 --> 02:24:36,250
...wind bowls that over.

2540
02:24:37,210 --> 02:24:38,836
WOOD:
That was a lot of work for us there.

2541
02:24:39,004 --> 02:24:42,298
We had four massive,
big aero-wind machines up there.

2542
02:24:42,466 --> 02:24:46,260
Probably 1 5 to 20 guys,
all throwing vermiculite and dust.

2543
02:24:46,428 --> 02:24:50,723
So that was pretty full-on, um,
with all that work, and at night as well.

2544
02:24:50,891 --> 02:24:53,726
RAPACE: The pieces that were kind of
in the storm were hitting me.

2545
02:24:53,894 --> 02:24:56,854
It was really hard and it felt like
somebody was punching me.

2546
02:24:57,189 --> 02:25:01,525
So even though it's a "fake" situation,
you get really bruised...

2547
02:25:01,693 --> 02:25:06,155
...and, you know, sore and, uh,
we were shooting night time.

2548
02:25:06,323 --> 02:25:07,865
It was dark and really cold.

2549
02:25:08,408 --> 02:25:09,909
INCH:
It was a night shoot.

2550
02:25:10,077 --> 02:25:12,703
We were working with the elements,
those wind machines...

2551
02:25:12,871 --> 02:25:15,873
...and they changed what we did
with the wires quite a bit.

2552
02:25:16,041 --> 02:25:17,541
We couldn't shoot that on a set...

2553
02:25:17,709 --> 02:25:20,544
...so everything I put towards that,
we had to basically--

2554
02:25:20,712 --> 02:25:24,590
I had to create a grid over the top
of this exterior set.

2555
02:25:24,758 --> 02:25:28,552
So, what l'd done basically was I brought
in a load of mechanical winches...

2556
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:32,223
...which give the ability to be able
to lift somebody up in the air...

2557
02:25:32,390 --> 02:25:36,602
...fly them across the ground,
jerk them off the ground, tumble them.

2558
02:25:40,607 --> 02:25:42,733
Because of the tight schedule
on that movie...

2559
02:25:42,901 --> 02:25:46,612
...that set was never really finished
until the day we shot on it.

2560
02:25:46,780 --> 02:25:50,825
So I was having to work rehearsals
in the evening on that set...

2561
02:25:50,992 --> 02:25:54,411
...while those guys were basically
making the set during the day.

2562
02:25:55,580 --> 02:25:59,250
RAPACE: We were actually rehearsing
and working that sequence...

2563
02:25:59,417 --> 02:26:01,544
...before we started to shoot the movie...

2564
02:26:01,711 --> 02:26:03,754
...and we were, you know,
hanging on these wires...

2565
02:26:03,922 --> 02:26:07,174
...and going back and forth,
and I think, you know, all this is really fun.

2566
02:26:07,342 --> 02:26:10,427
I enjoy it
and I wanna do as much as I can.

2567
02:26:11,596 --> 02:26:17,434
My stunt double is fantastic,
but l really wanna do it, so l was like:

2568
02:26:17,602 --> 02:26:19,937
But sometimes, you know,
they can't let us do everything...

2569
02:26:20,105 --> 02:26:21,313
...because if I get hurt, we--

2570
02:26:21,481 --> 02:26:25,234
You know, if something happened to me,
it could kind of-- Big disaster.

2571
02:26:25,402 --> 02:26:27,653
INCH: I was lucky with that double,
to tell you the truth.

2572
02:26:27,821 --> 02:26:30,531
When I actually first did some test stuff
for Ridley for it...

2573
02:26:30,699 --> 02:26:32,116
...I actually brought her in.

2574
02:26:32,284 --> 02:26:35,744
That was before they'd cast Noomi
and we shot with test stuff with her.

2575
02:26:35,912 --> 02:26:38,289
And, like, two weeks after that
he was talking about Noomi...

2576
02:26:38,456 --> 02:26:40,374
...and he said,
"l wanna have that double...

2577
02:26:40,542 --> 02:26:43,043
...because you can shoot on her.
She was amazing."

2578
02:26:43,211 --> 02:26:46,338
The tumbling and bouncing around stuff
was, you know--

2579
02:26:46,506 --> 02:26:49,175
That was all her double,
but then, you know, we still got moments...

2580
02:26:49,342 --> 02:26:51,635
...of being on this
when we were doing the rescue...

2581
02:26:51,803 --> 02:26:54,305
...we used all of--
Pretty much all of the actress...

2582
02:26:54,472 --> 02:26:57,558
...and the same for, um, Charlie as well.

2583
02:26:58,643 --> 02:27:01,061
You can program those winches
so that you could, you know--

2584
02:27:01,229 --> 02:27:04,565
I can pick somebody up and bounce them
around the rooms here, very, very safely...

2585
02:27:04,733 --> 02:27:07,526
...so it is something you can use
with the real actor...

2586
02:27:07,694 --> 02:27:10,154
...but they need to have time
to feel comfortable...

2587
02:27:10,322 --> 02:27:13,616
...and, you know, feel comfortable
with what they're doing, so it was a--

2588
02:27:13,783 --> 02:27:16,452
You know, we didn't get a huge amount
of rehearsal time with them...

2589
02:27:16,620 --> 02:27:19,663
...but l think David,
Michael Fassbender, he--

2590
02:27:19,831 --> 02:27:21,332
We had one day's rehearsal with him...

2591
02:27:21,499 --> 02:27:24,168
...but he nearly did, I think,
90 percent of his own stuff.

2592
02:27:24,336 --> 02:27:26,921
He did an amazing job, actually.
Really, really amazing job.

2593
02:27:33,178 --> 02:27:36,972
FASSBENDER: It's a lot of fun. You get to do
wire work, which is good fun, you know...

2594
02:27:37,140 --> 02:27:39,975
...once you get evertyhing tucked up
out of the way in the harness.

2595
02:27:40,644 --> 02:27:42,102
It's not looking too good for them...

2596
02:27:42,270 --> 02:27:46,941
...so David just sort of goes about his thing
and he puts a harness on his back...

2597
02:27:47,108 --> 02:27:51,820
...and opens up the door of the spaceship,
and goes out and saves their lives.

2598
02:27:54,699 --> 02:27:55,950
But, you know, it's wire work...

2599
02:27:56,117 --> 02:27:59,620
...so you just have to sort of allow yourself
to go and enjoy the ride...

2600
02:27:59,788 --> 02:28:01,830
...and it sort of takes you along.

2601
02:28:07,170 --> 02:28:09,880
Open the door. Open the door.

2602
02:28:15,720 --> 02:28:18,889
-Jesus, that's scary.
SCOTT: That good?

2603
02:28:19,057 --> 02:28:20,599
That is so scary.

2604
02:28:20,767 --> 02:28:23,560
INCH: This is when they found out
that Charlie was--

2605
02:28:23,728 --> 02:28:26,730
All the way through that mission,
Charlie's kind of deteriorating.

2606
02:28:26,898 --> 02:28:29,900
He's kind of-- Stuff's happening to him,
he's feeling ill.

2607
02:28:30,068 --> 02:28:32,486
He's basically been impregnated
by the alien.

2608
02:28:35,115 --> 02:28:36,907
[SHOUTS]

2609
02:28:37,993 --> 02:28:40,244
INCH: They're rushing to come back
onto the ship.

2610
02:28:40,412 --> 02:28:41,996
Vickers has heard what's going on.

2611
02:28:42,163 --> 02:28:44,081
They're on all the intercom
on the way back in...

2612
02:28:44,249 --> 02:28:47,001
...and she's basically meeting them
at the garage.

2613
02:28:47,168 --> 02:28:49,503
-What the hell?
SHAW: Unh.

2614
02:28:49,963 --> 02:28:51,422
VICKERS:
He's not coming on this ship.

2615
02:28:51,589 --> 02:28:54,300
KEENE: lt's a particularly tricky scene
for Noomi emotionally...

2616
02:28:54,467 --> 02:28:58,554
...because her love interest in the film
is being burnt to death...

2617
02:28:58,722 --> 02:29:02,766
...and also for Charlize because we actually
gave her a practical flame thrower.

2618
02:29:03,226 --> 02:29:04,685
If you need to turn it on and off...

2619
02:29:04,853 --> 02:29:07,938
...if anything happens to go wrong,
just switch that off and drop it.

2620
02:29:08,106 --> 02:29:09,690
-I don't like the words:
-Ha, ha.

2621
02:29:09,858 --> 02:29:12,109
-"lf something happens to go wrong."
-It's just protocol.

2622
02:29:12,277 --> 02:29:14,570
So we had a little rehearsal,
put her in a fire suit...

2623
02:29:14,738 --> 02:29:17,448
...and made sure she was comfortable
doing it.

2624
02:29:19,701 --> 02:29:21,368
I'd had a stunt double for her...

2625
02:29:21,536 --> 02:29:24,121
...and we were just messing around,
Ridley and l, and Ridley went:

2626
02:29:24,289 --> 02:29:26,165
"Wouldn't it be cool
if we could get the shot...

2627
02:29:26,333 --> 02:29:29,460
-...of Charlize setting him on fire?"
-Action!

2628
02:29:30,420 --> 02:29:33,213
MAN:
We can use that one. That was best.

2629
02:29:36,801 --> 02:29:40,679
Yeah, that was, um, my last day of shooting
in London, actually, when we did that...

2630
02:29:40,847 --> 02:29:45,809
...and I'm sure they made it the last day
just in case something went aflame.

2631
02:29:45,977 --> 02:29:48,312
Setting anybody on fire is hard enough,
you know.

2632
02:29:48,480 --> 02:29:53,859
I mean, the preparation that goes
into a full-body burn is quite intense.

2633
02:29:55,028 --> 02:29:59,031
Obviously, he's got all the gel suits on,
he's completely protected...

2634
02:29:59,199 --> 02:30:01,950
...but the reality of any burn
is it's a very dangerous thing to do.

2635
02:30:02,452 --> 02:30:04,495
MAN:
Action, Florian!

2636
02:30:14,422 --> 02:30:16,173
End.

2637
02:30:20,220 --> 02:30:21,845
Time out.

2638
02:30:23,473 --> 02:30:26,141
THERON: He's gotta step closer to me
before I do it.

2639
02:30:26,309 --> 02:30:27,518
MAN 1 :
Let him get closer.

2640
02:30:27,685 --> 02:30:30,604
-Okay, camera's running. Up!
MAN 2: Ready?

2641
02:30:30,772 --> 02:30:35,401
Three, two, one, action!

2642
02:30:36,361 --> 02:30:37,528
SHAW:
No!

2643
02:30:37,695 --> 02:30:40,155
No!

2644
02:30:42,283 --> 02:30:45,285
KEENE: The fear that something
had actually hurt the guy...

2645
02:30:45,453 --> 02:30:47,663
...and I think that came across. Um--

2646
02:30:47,831 --> 02:30:50,249
One of the moments in the film
where Charlize's character...

2647
02:30:50,417 --> 02:30:52,042
...shows some vulnerability...

2648
02:30:52,210 --> 02:30:55,212
...in that she's-- You know,
she's actually killing somebody.

2649
02:30:55,380 --> 02:30:58,340
And you could see that in her eyes
that she didn't like doing it.

2650
02:30:58,508 --> 02:31:01,176
She was uncomfortable doing it
and when we cut...

2651
02:31:01,344 --> 02:31:03,720
...and we put the stunt man out,
she was quite freaky...

2652
02:31:03,888 --> 02:31:06,890
...until the moment when the stunt man
put his thumbs up and said he's okay.

2653
02:31:07,058 --> 02:31:10,727
Oh, my God, l'm so shaky right now.

2654
02:31:10,895 --> 02:31:13,188
MAN 1 : You got that? They're good?
MAN 2: Yeah.

2655
02:31:13,356 --> 02:31:15,065
THERON:
Not my favorite thing, I have to say.

2656
02:31:15,233 --> 02:31:19,194
I had, like, a little moment of,
"Ugh, this is badass and I'm really badass...

2657
02:31:19,362 --> 02:31:21,113
...because l've got this flamethrower...

2658
02:31:21,281 --> 02:31:24,825
...and I'm just being a badass
in a Ridley Scott movie"...

2659
02:31:24,993 --> 02:31:28,662
...and then l went,
"Okay, don't want to burn this guy...

2660
02:31:28,830 --> 02:31:31,248
...and I wanna be able
to live with myself."

2661
02:31:31,416 --> 02:31:34,835
And this-- You know, these stunt guys
are crazy. They're just insane.

2662
02:31:35,003 --> 02:31:38,088
MAN: Very nice.
-Burning through all those layers.

2663
02:31:38,256 --> 02:31:40,132
INCH:
For us, as stunt people, that's what we do.

2664
02:31:40,300 --> 02:31:42,176
We get set on fire and it's no big deal.

2665
02:31:42,343 --> 02:31:44,928
But for someone
to actually torch somebody...

2666
02:31:45,096 --> 02:31:47,097
...it's a big deal for them, you know.

2667
02:31:47,265 --> 02:31:49,224
You're kind of trusting in me saying that:

2668
02:31:49,392 --> 02:31:51,810
"Yeah, he'll be fine.
We've got this special gel.

2669
02:31:51,978 --> 02:31:53,937
He's all gelled up.
You know, he'll be fine."

2670
02:31:54,105 --> 02:31:58,609
THERON: The flame was so hot
that I had a space helmet on...

2671
02:31:58,776 --> 02:32:01,528
...and I could feel the heat,
like, through the space helmet...

2672
02:32:01,696 --> 02:32:03,697
...and he's just lying there.

2673
02:32:03,865 --> 02:32:06,950
-I felt it through the-- Through the....
WOMAN: Yeah, l know.

2674
02:32:07,118 --> 02:32:09,036
MAN 1 : Nice one. This one--
MAN 2: l'll show you.

2675
02:32:09,204 --> 02:32:11,663
THERON: No, l would like some vodka.

INCH: Fifield was another big workshop
moment for us because l think we--

2683
02:32:38,733 --> 02:32:41,527
Because there was a lot of processes
when we were talking about that...

2684
02:32:41,694 --> 02:32:43,987
...the visual effects,
as to what they were gonna do...

2685
02:32:44,155 --> 02:32:45,822
...with the look of this character.

2686
02:32:45,990 --> 02:32:48,909
Originally, it was gonna be
a full-on CG character...

2687
02:32:49,077 --> 02:32:50,994
...so we were gonna basically
shoot the action...

2688
02:32:51,162 --> 02:32:52,996
...without anybody
and then shoot a plate...

2689
02:32:53,289 --> 02:32:55,999
...and then they were gonna
put the creature in there.

2690
02:33:01,130 --> 02:33:03,340
And then we got talking,
and, like, Ridley was saying:

2691
02:33:03,508 --> 02:33:06,343
"Let's see what he can bring to it,
bring to the table."

2692
02:33:06,511 --> 02:33:07,844
I started workshopping with him...

2693
02:33:08,012 --> 02:33:12,099
...and we'd shoot some moments
of him kind of going crazy, as Sean does...

2694
02:33:12,267 --> 02:33:15,310
...heh, and, um, they loved the idea of him...

2695

...using some part of him
within that moment.

2696

as it runs down...

2709
02:34:11,284 --> 02:34:14,745
...and another guy is setting him on fire
and he disappears around a corner...

2710
02:34:14,912 --> 02:34:17,414
...and the next thing you know,
he's flying off of this truck...

2711
02:34:17,582 --> 02:34:20,250
...and they're shooting him
and he's on fire.

2712
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:24,254
As Fifield's running
through the garage...

2713
02:34:24,422 --> 02:34:27,341
...we've got these mechanics running
and getting flame torches.

2714
02:34:27,508 --> 02:34:30,886
And then as he runs around the corner,
we'd clip him with fire.

that was probably, like...

of what the final look would be.

And Weta used the clean plates to recreate
the CG version of the actor's performance.

They matched the animation
to his performance.

2955
02:48:13,834 --> 02:48:15,501
And you could put the two side-by-side.

2956
02:48:15,669 --> 02:48:19,839
Ridley wanted a very aggressive
taking over of his body.

2957
02:48:20,007 --> 02:48:22,800
And we knew we had to get
into a molecular level...

2958
02:48:22,968 --> 02:48:26,137
...to see, you know, his component parts
were being torn apart.

2959
02:48:26,305 --> 02:48:29,557
You know, molecule by molecule,
by the infection with the goo.

2960
02:48:29,725 --> 02:48:31,476
So the main things
that we were looking at...

2961
02:48:31,643 --> 02:48:33,603
...is firstly grounding it in reality...

2962
02:48:33,770 --> 02:48:37,732
...and using reference
for each of the types of DNA...

2963
02:48:37,900 --> 02:48:39,984
...because we have such
a short amount of time...

2964
02:48:40,152 --> 02:48:44,280
...to tell the story of the DNA
getting infected, breaking apart...

2965
02:48:44,448 --> 02:48:47,658
...and then reforming and recombining
to show Earth DNA.

2966
02:48:47,826 --> 02:48:50,828
We had to make the designs
of the different DNA...

2967
02:48:50,996 --> 02:48:55,208
...quite different and quite graphical,
quite illustrative of what they were.

2968
02:48:55,375 --> 02:48:57,001
So the Engineer's DNA, you know...

2969
02:48:57,169 --> 02:48:59,128
...we thought,
"This needs to be quite sinister."

2970
02:48:59,296 --> 02:49:02,048
But we know it's gonna get infected
and the infection has to look...

2971
02:49:02,216 --> 02:49:04,717
...you know, more messed up
than the Engineer's DNA.

2972
02:49:04,885 --> 02:49:06,010
So, you know, we were using--

2973
02:49:06,178 --> 02:49:09,680
We used quite a light color palette
for the Engineer's DNA...

2974
02:49:09,848 --> 02:49:13,476
...and then the infection comes on
as very dark, and as very melted-looking...

2975
02:49:13,644 --> 02:49:18,898
...and it starts to distort
and then break apart the Engineer's DNA.

2976
02:49:19,066 --> 02:49:22,902
Ridley actually said to us for that section,
"lt has to feel like war in there."

2977
02:49:23,070 --> 02:49:25,112
The DNA just being torn apart...

2978
02:49:25,280 --> 02:49:28,324
...and just ripping itself apart
in as many different ways as possible.

2979
02:49:28,492 --> 02:49:30,743
One thing about the particles
that Ridley really wanted...

2980
02:49:30,911 --> 02:49:33,037
...to kind of hit in terms of the way
that they move...

2981
02:49:33,205 --> 02:49:36,040
...he wanted to get a sense
that they weren't just falling off him.

2982
02:49:36,208 --> 02:49:39,919
He wanted to give a sense that they
had a little bit of intelligence, almost.

2983
02:49:40,087 --> 02:49:41,587
He said we should look at starlings...

2984
02:49:41,755 --> 02:49:44,215
...and he saw some great footage
of starlings...

2985
02:49:44,383 --> 02:49:47,843
...the way that they flock and move.
Ridley liked that sense of motion.

2986
02:49:48,011 --> 02:49:51,889
And that's what Weta used as a reference
for how those would animate.

2987
02:49:52,057 --> 02:49:53,099
It always had to escalate.

2988
02:49:53,267 --> 02:49:57,562
So each shot needed to be
much more advanced than the one before.

2989
02:49:57,729 --> 02:49:59,814
It got to the stage
where parts of the Engineer...

2990
02:49:59,982 --> 02:50:02,900
...would just tear open
and there's a shot where, you know...

2991
02:50:03,068 --> 02:50:06,529
...his back just opens right up, you know,
so you could see his spine.

2992
02:50:06,697 --> 02:50:08,739
You know, being able
to contribute ideas like that...

2993
02:50:08,907 --> 02:50:10,866
...and you'd put them
in front of Ridley and say:

2994
02:50:11,034 --> 02:50:13,202
"Well, how about
we just have his back tear open?"

2995
02:50:13,370 --> 02:50:15,913
And to have him come back and go,
"Yeah, that's great!"

2996
02:50:16,081 --> 02:50:19,917
You know, it's just fantastic to know
that some of the ideas that Weta created...

2997
02:50:20,085 --> 02:50:22,587
...are, you know, getting into the film.

2998
02:50:25,799 --> 02:50:27,717
STAMMERS: Ridley loves to shoot
as much practically...

2999
02:50:27,884 --> 02:50:29,844
...and for evertyhing
that we had in the film.

3000
02:50:30,012 --> 02:50:32,763
There was a practical version of that,
though, he could shoot with...

3001
02:50:32,931 --> 02:50:38,686
...but at some point, we always knew
that we're gonna have to take over to CG.

3002
02:50:38,854 --> 02:50:41,105
There's the spaceships,
the Prometheus...

3003
02:50:41,273 --> 02:50:43,649
...that was a given
that we were gonna have to do that.

3004
02:50:43,817 --> 02:50:46,152
There were so many scenes,
so, you know, we said:

3005
02:50:46,320 --> 02:50:51,115
"Let's invest all the money into building
really great CG versions of these ships."

3006
02:50:51,283 --> 02:50:54,619
The Prometheus' design of it
came purely from the Art Department.

3007
02:50:54,786 --> 02:50:57,038
Steve Burg and Ben Procter
were responsible...

3008
02:50:57,205 --> 02:50:59,582
...for, you know,
building and detailing the ship...

3009
02:50:59,750 --> 02:51:03,127
...to a point where we had really good
approved concepts from Ridley.

3010
02:51:03,295 --> 02:51:05,087
MARlS:
He actually built the model himself...

3011
02:51:05,255 --> 02:51:06,922
...and used that to give to MPC...

3012
02:51:07,090 --> 02:51:09,967
...who was hired to actually create it
for the feature.

3013
02:51:10,135 --> 02:51:12,303
HENLEY: lt was a great opportunity
to show, you know...

3014
02:51:12,471 --> 02:51:16,098
...our potential on what we could do
with computer graphics on spaceships.

3015
02:51:16,266 --> 02:51:19,018
We were given some very cool
concept designs...

3016
02:51:19,186 --> 02:51:21,145
...which had a fair amount of detail.

3017
02:51:21,313 --> 02:51:24,774
But through the film and the previs
and getting the storyboard from Ridley...

3018
02:51:24,941 --> 02:51:27,610
...there were shots
that were extremely close.

3019
02:51:27,778 --> 02:51:29,445
We had an awful lot of coverage of it.

3020
02:51:29,613 --> 02:51:31,280
So we had the design based...

3021
02:51:31,448 --> 02:51:33,699
...from the concept guys
and we built it to that stage...

3022
02:51:33,867 --> 02:51:36,285
...and then we had to go
in and in and in, closer and closer.

3023
02:51:36,703 --> 02:51:40,331
DOMENECH: And zoom into the cockpit.
We have a rough interior.

3024
02:51:41,667 --> 02:51:43,834
You can sort of see the seats in there.

3025
02:51:44,336 --> 02:51:46,587
MAN: lt's very cool.
DOMENECH: lt's a very, very heavy model.

3026
02:51:46,755 --> 02:51:50,966
It is a very, very large ship,
so it looks like a jet fighter sometimes.

3027
02:51:51,134 --> 02:51:54,011
So VTOL ships who can do
vertical takeoff and landing...

3028
02:51:54,179 --> 02:51:57,682
...and it's got these four massive legs, like,
the engines.

3029
02:51:57,849 --> 02:52:00,726
So it's like we have to make it look cool
where at the same time...

3030
02:52:00,894 --> 02:52:04,605
...it cannot really be super agile
because that takes the size away.

3031
02:52:04,773 --> 02:52:07,566
And with all the landings--
It's, like, we did it as slow as possible...

3032
02:52:07,734 --> 02:52:09,360
...without making it look boring.

3033
02:52:09,528 --> 02:52:11,862
So it's agile, at the same time,
it has to look massive.

3034
02:52:12,030 --> 02:52:13,406
DANESE:
Selling the scale of it...

3035
02:52:13,573 --> 02:52:17,952
...you wanna feel something massive
is landing on this dusty planet.

3036
02:52:18,120 --> 02:52:23,040
We had to do this huge amount
of dust raised by the ground.

3037
02:52:23,208 --> 02:52:27,878
So, really, the scale of that shot is given
by how the dynamic of the dust...

3038
02:52:28,046 --> 02:52:31,424
...and the tiny points
and the tiny rocks are moving.

3039
02:52:31,591 --> 02:52:33,050
When we're getting close...

3040
02:52:33,218 --> 02:52:35,720
...you need to see the detail
and there's so much texture time...

3041
02:52:35,887 --> 02:52:39,724
...went into adding scale to the ship
to make it feel like it was big enough.

3042
02:52:40,392 --> 02:52:45,020
HENLEY: Maybe we need just a sense of a
little more specular in some of these areas...

3043
02:52:45,188 --> 02:52:47,231
...that are quite smooth.

3044
02:52:47,399 --> 02:52:51,068
Just very subtly change the value,
you know, in the highlights here.

3045
02:52:51,236 --> 02:52:53,571
That was a big challenge
definitely for building it...

3046
02:52:53,739 --> 02:52:56,073
...because it's a task
that you could just go on and on.

3047
02:52:56,241 --> 02:53:00,161
But, you know, the final result is great
and MPC did a fantastic job on that.

3048
02:53:02,247 --> 02:53:04,081
HENLEY:
Planet from above as you fly in.

3049
02:53:04,249 --> 02:53:06,751
Ridley found a particular moon
of Jupiter...

3050
02:53:06,918 --> 02:53:08,878
...and so that became the model
for the gas giant.

3051
02:53:09,045 --> 02:53:12,798
We shot things like ink swirling
to get, like, nice fluid patterns.

3052
02:53:12,966 --> 02:53:14,300
And we wanted to have the rings...

3053
02:53:14,468 --> 02:53:17,261
...so we analyzed Saturn rings,
but tried something slightly different.

3054
02:53:17,429 --> 02:53:19,680
Ridley had gone talked
to some NASA guys...

3055
02:53:19,848 --> 02:53:22,933
...about what it should be out there
in space, what it should be on the planet.

3056
02:53:23,101 --> 02:53:25,352
He had all this feedback
that he was very excited about.

3057
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:26,854
STAMMERS:
Planet environment was incredible.

3058
02:53:27,022 --> 02:53:28,939
Steve Messing
was one of the concept artists...

3059
02:53:29,107 --> 02:53:31,442
...responsible for most
of the planetscapes.

3060
02:53:31,610 --> 02:53:33,319
It was clear that it was gonna,
you know--

3061
02:53:33,487 --> 02:53:36,489
If something real was gonna be shot,
it was going to be heavily manipulated.

3062
02:53:36,656 --> 02:53:40,451
The whole planet environment was gonna
require quite a lot of visual-effects work...

3063
02:53:40,619 --> 02:53:42,828
...to join different landscapes together...

3064
02:53:42,996 --> 02:53:45,790
...add atmospherics and weather
and lightning, and things like that.

3065
02:53:45,957 --> 02:53:48,292
Ridley's main--
He first brought forward...

3066
02:53:48,460 --> 02:53:52,046
...was that it was gonna be terrible weather
on this planet, and that was our basic brief.

3067
02:53:52,214 --> 02:53:54,632
STAMMERS: We've put a lot of effort
into designing with Ridley.

3068
02:53:54,800 --> 02:53:59,512
All the landscape was kind of based
on him really loving Wadi Rum in Jordan.

3069
02:53:59,679 --> 02:54:02,306
HENLEY: There was a photo
that Ridley had found somewhere...

3070
02:54:02,474 --> 02:54:04,558
...of some really interesting
mountain landscape...

3071
02:54:04,726 --> 02:54:08,437
...and he'd drawn in some pyramids
in the middle of that valley he found.

3072
02:54:08,605 --> 02:54:11,023
And that became kind of the thing
that we wanted to create.

3073
02:54:11,191 --> 02:54:15,486
STAMMERS: l went to Jordan with an aerial
unit and MPC's supervisor, Charlie Henley...

3074
02:54:15,654 --> 02:54:17,822
...and we shots thousands
of thousands of stills.

3075
02:54:17,989 --> 02:54:19,406
We shot loads of plates as well.

3076
02:54:19,574 --> 02:54:21,826
So there's some real plates
of Jordan untouched...

3077
02:54:21,993 --> 02:54:25,830
...and then there are areas where you see
a sandy desert as the ground.

3078
02:54:25,997 --> 02:54:30,376
We've replaced that with digital versions
of what we've shot in lceland.

3079
02:54:35,715 --> 02:54:36,757
Hey, baby.

3080
02:54:37,175 --> 02:54:38,592
STAMMERS:
The creature work was--

3081
02:54:38,760 --> 02:54:40,678
You know, there's a good variety
of creature work.

3082
02:54:40,846 --> 02:54:44,098
Neal Scanlan's team,
the creature supervisor...

3083
02:54:44,266 --> 02:54:47,226
...had a number of tasks to create,
and Hammerpedes are a great example.

3084
02:54:47,394 --> 02:54:50,312
You know, Neal's team did a fantastic...

3085
02:54:50,480 --> 02:54:52,815
...fully animatronic version
of the Hammerpede.

3086
02:54:52,983 --> 02:54:54,358
Puppeteered versions...

3087
02:54:54,526 --> 02:54:56,902
...things that could be wrapped
around Millburn's arm...

3088
02:54:57,070 --> 02:54:59,780
...that we could, you know, puppeteer
for real, pull through, so....

3089
02:54:59,948 --> 02:55:01,866
We shot most of that scene
with the Hammerpede...

3090
02:55:02,033 --> 02:55:04,827
...with a practical Hammerpede
there for the whole time.

3091
02:55:04,995 --> 02:55:08,414
MARlS: Ridley really wanted to try
and do things real first...

3092
02:55:08,582 --> 02:55:11,584
...and where it would fail,
then he would want us to do it digitally.

3093
02:55:11,751 --> 02:55:14,044
STAMMERS: There were certain limitations
of things he couldn't do.

3094
02:55:14,212 --> 02:55:16,839
The way that the mouth kind of uncurls
and opens up...

3095
02:55:17,215 --> 02:55:20,551
...we could only see it from behind
sort of, you know, doing kind of this--

3096
02:55:21,344 --> 02:55:23,929
You know, MPC ended up
doing the frontal version...

3097
02:55:24,097 --> 02:55:25,472
...where it unfolds and opens up...

3098
02:55:25,640 --> 02:55:27,641
...then we cut to the rear view
which is practical.

3099
02:55:27,809 --> 02:55:30,561
So we're cutting from practical to CG
a number of times...

3100
02:55:30,729 --> 02:55:34,064
...and then, obviously, there's a point
where the head gets cut off.

3101
02:55:34,232 --> 02:55:37,276
At that point that's where we just take
what he had and it's like, "Okay."

3102
02:55:37,444 --> 02:55:39,820
Now we go CG,
we gotta regrow a new head.

3103
02:55:39,988 --> 02:55:43,532
The head is gonna then burrow into
the acid burn hole that's in Millburn's arm...

3104
02:55:43,700 --> 02:55:46,785
...and once it gets into his helmet,
that's all down to us to take over...

3105
02:55:46,953 --> 02:55:50,581
...and, you know, Rafe Spall
did a great performance...

3106
02:55:50,749 --> 02:55:53,292
...in reacting to something
that he had no idea...

3107
02:55:53,460 --> 02:55:55,085
...really what it was gonna be doing.

3108
02:55:55,253 --> 02:55:58,005
Now, he knew it was gonna end up
being rammed down his throat...

3109
02:55:58,173 --> 02:56:01,592
...so he gave a good performance
for that.

3110
02:56:01,760 --> 02:56:05,179
You know, really a pretty disgusting shot
at the end of it. It was great.

STAMMERS: Ridley, you know, really
wanted it to be quite graphic as well.

3131
02:57:04,197 --> 02:57:06,240
We did quite a heavy previs
on this sequence.

3132
02:57:06,408 --> 02:57:11,412
In fact, a team from Halon did a great job
of prevising the whole sequence.

3133
02:57:11,830 --> 02:57:15,874
And we previs'd it as an R-rated version
and we previs'd it as a PG-1 3 version.

3134
02:57:16,042 --> 02:57:18,627
The Med Pod was one of the most exciting
sequences to work on...

...to the chest-bursting scene
in the original Alien.

3137
02:57:23,133 --> 02:57:27,511

to make it look as real...

as we possibly could.

02:57:38,273 --> 02:57:40,441
You know, the whole scanning motion
and laser-cutting...

3142
02:57:40,608 --> 02:57:43,360
...the spreading, and the claw that comes in
to pull out the placenta.

3143
02:57:43,528 --> 02:57:46,196
That's all there.
Sort of full CG work at that point.

3144
02:57:46,364 --> 02:57:49,116
There's a lot of subtle things going on
through the sequence.

3145
02:57:49,284 --> 02:57:52,119
Firstly, Noomi is actually
quite a proficient belly dancer...

3146
02:57:52,287 --> 02:57:54,788
...and what we've done
is put some enhancements onto that...

3147
02:57:54,956 --> 02:57:59,043
...so you can see the trilobite just nudge
against her flesh from the inside...

3148
02:57:59,210 --> 02:58:00,544
...and put the odd bulge in.

3149
02:58:00,712 --> 02:58:03,964
STAMMERS: This sequence is, you know,
is incredible.

3150
02:58:04,132 --> 02:58:10,012
Neal Scanlan's team just gave us the most
incredible practical things to work with.

3151
02:58:10,180 --> 02:58:14,266
I mean, you know, fully animatronic
baby trilobite with a placenta...

3152
02:58:14,434 --> 02:58:16,810
...and a placental sac that's full of goo.

3153
02:58:16,978 --> 02:58:19,730
It's just-- lt was great.
There were some really good things.

3154
02:58:19,898 --> 02:58:23,067
Having the on-set reference that Ridley shot
gave us a lot of confidence...

3155
02:58:23,234 --> 02:58:25,652
...to know what he wanted
and be able to replicate that...

3156
02:58:25,820 --> 02:58:28,697
...and be able to deliver something
that we knew he'd be happy with.

3157
02:58:30,909 --> 02:58:34,328
STAMMERS: The staples are brilliant.
We talked about that, you know, with Ridley.

3158
02:58:34,496 --> 02:58:38,207
The practicalities of what really would be
in terms of futuristic surgeries.

3159
02:58:38,374 --> 02:58:41,460
Like when you've got this fantastic
Med Pod machine that can do...

3160
02:58:41,628 --> 02:58:44,922
...you know, any number of things,
yet he still wants staples?

3161
02:58:45,090 --> 02:58:46,632
But he just loved the idea of staples.

3162
02:58:46,800 --> 02:58:49,301
It's just that thing of like,
seeing that staple gun gets you...

3163
02:58:49,469 --> 02:58:50,511
[lMlTATING STAPLING]

3164
02:58:50,678 --> 02:58:53,347
...and you know, sticking staples
in her stomach was just brilliant.

3165
02:58:55,141 --> 02:58:57,601
That baby trilobite
grows really, really quickly.

3166
02:58:57,769 --> 02:59:01,605
And I remember a moment when we
went over to Neal's creature shop.

3167
02:59:01,773 --> 02:59:05,400
When he was sculpting the original version
of that, it was a lot smaller.

3168
02:59:05,568 --> 02:59:07,903
I think we were all thinking
it was a bit big already.

3169
02:59:08,071 --> 02:59:11,657
And Neal said to Ridley-- He said,
"l'm really concerned about the scale."

3170
02:59:11,825 --> 02:59:14,827
And Ridley said, "Yeah. Yeah.
We should make it bigger."

3171
02:59:14,994 --> 02:59:16,912
And he was like--
Neal was like, "Oh, okay."

3172
02:59:17,080 --> 02:59:20,332
MARlS: Neal essentially built pieces,
gave us all the reference we needed...

3173
02:59:20,500 --> 02:59:21,917
...and we just gave that to Weta...

3174
02:59:22,085 --> 02:59:25,671
...and Weta built it and then on top of that
they put their textures...

3175
02:59:25,839 --> 02:59:28,924
...because Ridley wanted
that peeling, flaking skin look to it...

3176
02:59:29,092 --> 02:59:31,135
...which was really hard to do
prosthetically, so....

3177
02:59:31,302 --> 02:59:32,845
You know, Weta finished all that off...

3178
02:59:33,012 --> 02:59:35,556
...and they had a great basis
from Neal's stuff.

3179
02:59:35,723 --> 02:59:40,477
STAMMERS: You know, the battle between
those two becomes this great struggle...

3180
02:59:40,645 --> 02:59:42,354
...and he's just overwhelmed.

3181
02:59:42,522 --> 02:59:45,983
You know, Ridley had a great idea
for that sequence.

3182
02:59:46,151 --> 02:59:47,985
You know, he should get his feet up
on the door.

3183
02:59:48,153 --> 02:59:50,070
"Get his feet up on the door.
He's pulling back."

3184
02:59:50,238 --> 02:59:55,117
And you get these sort of great shots
where you could really feel the struggle...

3185
02:59:55,285 --> 02:59:57,703
...of him just trying to pull back away
from this thing...

3186
02:59:57,871 --> 02:59:59,746
...and, you know,
braced up against the door.

3187
02:59:59,914 --> 03:00:01,123
It's a great moment.

3188
03:00:01,291 --> 03:00:03,458
HlLL: One of the main design aspects
with the trilobite...

3189
03:00:03,626 --> 03:00:06,587
...was to really get a sense
of tension and strength...

3190
03:00:06,754 --> 03:00:09,089
...in this quite squishy, you know--

3191
03:00:09,257 --> 03:00:12,176
He has a vertebrae,
but down his tentacles he has no bones.

3192
03:00:12,343 --> 03:00:16,346
So we needed to make sure that
when his tentacles are very stretched out...

3193
03:00:16,514 --> 03:00:18,348
...that we get a sense
of the musculature...

3194
03:00:18,516 --> 03:00:21,435
...and when it was compressed,
when he was all squashed up...

3195
03:00:21,603 --> 03:00:24,354
...you know, you see all the folds
and wrinkles in the skin.

3196
03:00:24,522 --> 03:00:25,814
STAMMERS:
They had a real challenge...

3197
03:00:25,982 --> 03:00:28,025
...to animate the trilobite's performance
to match...

3198
03:00:28,193 --> 03:00:30,277
...what lan Whyte
was effectively doing with nothing.

3199
03:00:30,445 --> 03:00:33,447
Definitely a tricky sequence for sure.
But...

3200
03:00:33,615 --> 03:00:36,200
...again, that worked out really well
in the end.

3201
03:00:41,080 --> 03:00:43,081
[CHATTERING]

3202
03:00:44,918 --> 03:00:48,045
The Fifield creature, it was another beat
that Ridley wanted an action sequence.

3203
03:00:48,213 --> 03:00:51,715
And he conceived this as a short beat
just to keep the pace of the film going.

3204
03:00:51,883 --> 03:00:54,218
And we need an exciting action moment.

3205
03:00:54,385 --> 03:00:58,764
And Fifield's transitioned
into something slightly more alien.

3206
03:00:58,932 --> 03:01:01,892
It was a bit ambiguous
as to which way it was gonna go.

3207
03:01:02,060 --> 03:01:05,562
MARlS: The original intent was that
any kind of gross movements:

3208
03:01:05,730 --> 03:01:08,565
Big running, jumping, things like that
would be a digital character...

3209
03:01:08,733 --> 03:01:11,443
...which they would build one on set
which would be shown here...

3210
03:01:11,611 --> 03:01:13,153
...as some sort of prosthetic.

3211
03:01:13,321 --> 03:01:15,822
We would go across to that
and just match to that...

3212
03:01:15,990 --> 03:01:19,701
...and then we'd do his digital motions so
he could run properly how Ridley wanted.

3213
03:01:19,869 --> 03:01:23,997
Ridley kind of wanted to take it more
into an animal realm for his motions...

3214
03:01:24,165 --> 03:01:26,583
...sort of kind of baboonish
things like that.

3215
03:01:26,751 --> 03:01:29,086
STAMMERS: There was one image
that Ridley kept going back to...

3216
03:01:29,254 --> 03:01:31,338
...which was what he refers to
as the "baby head."

3217
03:01:31,506 --> 03:01:33,090
And he kind of loved that image.

3218
03:01:33,258 --> 03:01:38,136
And, you know, the design kind of really
worked, worked and worked around that ...

3219
03:01:38,304 --> 03:01:42,516
...for a long time and when, you know,
we're getting closer to shooting...

3220
03:01:42,684 --> 03:01:45,936
...we were still not at a point where we had,
you know, a final design for that.

3221
03:01:46,104 --> 03:01:47,688
SLOAN:
When we started on Fifield...

3222
03:01:47,855 --> 03:01:50,941
...he was kind of big,
kind of mean, kind of fast.

3223
03:01:51,109 --> 03:01:53,026
That was pretty much all we had
at the beginning.

3224
03:01:53,194 --> 03:01:56,780
We ended up having the actor,
Sean Harris, who played Fifield.

3225
03:01:57,573 --> 03:02:00,659
He was in a prosthetic makeup
and with sort of blackened-up armor...

3226
03:02:00,827 --> 03:02:02,953
...and he ran
through the entire sequence for us.

3227
03:02:03,121 --> 03:02:04,955
Sean is incredibly intense, as well.

3228
03:02:05,123 --> 03:02:08,125
Anything you'd wanted, he was fine.
"Fifield needs to be on fire."

3229
03:02:08,293 --> 03:02:09,626
"That's fine. Set me on fire."

3230
03:02:15,758 --> 03:02:18,468
SCOTT:
I can design the whole thing...

3231
03:02:18,636 --> 03:02:23,140
...see it shot with the actor in makeup,
in full makeup...

3232
03:02:23,308 --> 03:02:25,142
...see how he does...

3233
03:02:25,310 --> 03:02:29,813
...and then do a combination
of elements of the actor...

3234
03:02:29,981 --> 03:02:32,816
...in relation
to some digital enhancement.

3235
03:02:33,484 --> 03:02:36,028
-Um, or not.
FERNANDEZ: The first brief of Fifield...

3236
03:02:36,195 --> 03:02:38,488
...was more or less human,
more or less alien.

3237
03:02:38,656 --> 03:02:40,824
Ridley was not locked in
on the concept yet.

3238
03:02:40,992 --> 03:02:43,327
So development continued at Weta.

3239
03:02:43,494 --> 03:02:45,871
One of the big things
was getting right balance in the face.

3240
03:02:46,039 --> 03:02:49,624
Like, between seeing the actor
and having the--

3241
03:02:49,792 --> 03:02:51,668
Maintaining the alien design
on the outside...

3242
03:02:51,836 --> 03:02:53,587
...because he's transforming
into the alien.

3243
03:02:53,755 --> 03:02:56,256
HlLL: We sort of came up with a sort of
withered remainder of a head.

3244
03:02:56,424 --> 03:02:59,176
And then over time
and over a few design iterations...

3245
03:02:59,344 --> 03:03:02,512
...it became more important
and the head actually shrunk...

3246
03:03:02,680 --> 03:03:07,017
...to the point where the outer exoskeleton
head was actually quite tight...

3247
03:03:07,185 --> 03:03:10,020
...to Fifield as a kind of distorted human.

3248
03:03:10,188 --> 03:03:11,938
FERNANDEZ:
While on the body side of things...

3249
03:03:12,106 --> 03:03:14,107
...really, it comes more down to,
like, proportions.

3250
03:03:14,275 --> 03:03:17,652
Limb length, like joints,
the setup of the legs and the arms.

3251
03:03:18,529 --> 03:03:20,030
So that show the alien features...

3252
03:03:20,198 --> 03:03:23,950
...but still enable us to do
all the crazy movements he's gonna do.

3253
03:03:24,118 --> 03:03:27,245
There were times when we're designing,
"l don't want something too monstrous.

3254
03:03:27,413 --> 03:03:29,706
It's gonna be quick,
we're not gonna see much."

3255
03:03:29,874 --> 03:03:33,752
Funny if the actor is winning.

3256
03:03:34,212 --> 03:03:36,380
The digital enhancement is excellent...

3257
03:03:36,798 --> 03:03:38,882
...but it looks like a monster.

3258
03:03:39,050 --> 03:03:41,551
Whereas, the actor
still looks like the actor...

3259
03:03:41,719 --> 03:03:43,553
...and what he does
is pretty damned good.

3260
03:03:43,721 --> 03:03:46,848
So both are done,
but l'm able to look at them both...

3261
03:03:47,016 --> 03:03:50,060
...and say, "Okay,
which is the most effective?"

3262
03:03:50,228 --> 03:03:53,355
A few comments were kind of like,
"You know, we wanted to see Sean Harris."

3263
03:03:53,523 --> 03:03:55,565
Like, he's a great actor...

3264
03:03:55,733 --> 03:03:59,069
...and provided a sense of character
and realism to the shots.

3265
03:03:59,237 --> 03:04:02,030
And they felt like seeing a CG character
at that point of Sean Harris...

3266
03:04:02,198 --> 03:04:03,740
...almost takes you out of the movie.

3267
03:04:04,575 --> 03:04:08,203
Weta did a fantastic job
of creating a CG version of Fifield.

3268
03:04:08,371 --> 03:04:12,082
And it's--
You know, he's really disgusting.

3269
03:04:12,250 --> 03:04:16,878
Ultimately, what you see in the final film
is Sean Harris in makeup.

3270
03:04:21,592 --> 03:04:24,553
The Deacon's birth
was another one of those sequences...

3271
03:04:24,720 --> 03:04:26,054
...that people are waiting for.

3272
03:04:26,222 --> 03:04:28,598
STAMMERS: l remember seeing
early concepts of the Deacon...

3273
03:04:28,766 --> 03:04:33,270
...six to eight months before we started
shooting. We're not that far from what it was.

3274
03:04:33,438 --> 03:04:37,399
I mean, it still had, you know, no eyes
and an elongated head.

3275
03:04:37,567 --> 03:04:39,776
MAN 1 :
Close the mouth. Close the mouth.

3276
03:04:39,944 --> 03:04:41,611
-Close the mouth.
MAN 2: Mm. Yummy.

3277
03:04:41,779 --> 03:04:43,029
MAN 3:
Up. Up.

3278
03:04:43,197 --> 03:04:47,409
Neal's team again, you know,
built a full prosthetic version...

3279
03:04:47,577 --> 03:04:50,454
...of the Deacon for the birth of it
from the Engineer.

3280
03:04:50,621 --> 03:04:54,249
And what you see in the film
is something again where we shot...

3281
03:04:54,417 --> 03:04:56,334
...everything practically
as much as we could.

3282
03:04:56,502 --> 03:04:59,212
MARlS: Ridley said, "Yeah, we'll do that
for real and as much as we can."

3283
03:04:59,380 --> 03:05:00,922
So they puppeteered the Deacon.

3284
03:05:01,090 --> 03:05:04,968
He stands up and he starts screaming.
It was great. They did a fantastic job.

3285
03:05:05,136 --> 03:05:07,345
There was a couple of things
that we had to add to it.

3286
03:05:07,513 --> 03:05:12,851
Weta essentially took a digital scan
of the creature on set, the puppet...

3287
03:05:13,019 --> 03:05:16,146
...photographed it and they built a version
that matched to it exactly.

3288
03:05:16,314 --> 03:05:19,065
The Deacon is actually described
as an ultramorph.

3289
03:05:19,233 --> 03:05:22,319
You know, it's come out of not a human,
but from an Engineer.

3290
03:05:22,487 --> 03:05:24,779
So it's much bigger and stronger...

3291
03:05:24,947 --> 03:05:26,990
...and much more developed
than the xenomorph.

3292
03:05:27,158 --> 03:05:30,911
But it's still just been born,
and it's still finding its feet.

3293
03:05:31,078 --> 03:05:33,830
So quite literally
when we first animate it...

3294
03:05:33,998 --> 03:05:37,792
...it needed to sort of scrabble around
as if it was a newly born...

3295
03:05:37,960 --> 03:05:40,670
...standing-up-for-the-first-time animal,
to get him on his feet.

3296
03:05:40,838 --> 03:05:42,172
And the first time he talks.

3297
03:05:42,340 --> 03:05:43,673
STAMMERS:
A lot of people think, you know...

3298
03:05:43,841 --> 03:05:46,510
...it's just trying-- A precursor
to what was designed as the alien.

3299
03:05:46,677 --> 03:05:49,137
But the jaw is actually based
on a goblin shark.

3300
03:05:49,305 --> 03:05:52,015
You know,
Ridley loves that motion that it has.

3301
03:05:52,183 --> 03:05:55,477
And it has this lower jaw
that sort of unlatches...

3302
03:05:55,645 --> 03:05:57,521
...and a secondary jaw comes out...

3303
03:05:57,688 --> 03:06:01,525
...and that's totally where the Deacon's jaw
is based on.

3304
03:06:06,697 --> 03:06:10,367
STAMMERS: The scene towards the end of
the film when the Prometheus is taking off...

3305
03:06:10,535 --> 03:06:13,620
...and the Juggefnaut is taking off,
we see the Juggefnaut for the first time.

3306
03:06:13,788 --> 03:06:15,580
It's the best action sequence in the film.

3307
03:06:15,748 --> 03:06:18,041
It's long, there's lots happening,
there's a lot of drama.

3308
03:06:18,209 --> 03:06:21,878
And, you know, it's the first time
that we really see the Juggefnaut...

3309
03:06:22,046 --> 03:06:23,838
...in detail emerging out of the silo.

3310
03:06:24,006 --> 03:06:26,174
Shaw is kind of running up the hill
out of the way.

3311
03:06:26,342 --> 03:06:29,344
You see this thing emerging behind her.
It's a fantastic moment.

3312
03:06:29,512 --> 03:06:33,056
MARlS: Going into it, he always knew
that it was gonna be a big event.

3313
03:06:33,224 --> 03:06:35,225
We had talked about
doing a miniature for it...

3314
03:06:35,393 --> 03:06:37,394
...because we knew
we could get pieces of it.

3315
03:06:37,562 --> 03:06:40,021
But we're worried because of the amount
of detail on that ship.

3316
03:06:40,189 --> 03:06:43,733
It's so complicated to build. We'd get one
or two takes and we wouldn't be happy.

3317
03:06:43,901 --> 03:06:47,279
MPC did some fantastic CG destruction.

3318
03:06:47,446 --> 03:06:49,906
And they sold me on the idea
that these guys can do it.

3319
03:06:50,241 --> 03:06:54,244
HENLEY: The original derelict was the basis
for the current Juggefnaut that we built.

3320
03:06:54,412 --> 03:06:57,914
What Ridley wanted to do in this film
was bring in a much higher level...

3321
03:06:58,082 --> 03:06:59,416
...of detail and scale.

3322
03:06:59,584 --> 03:07:02,377
STAMMERS: The Juggefnaut was
real difficult one to get the scale of...

3323
03:07:02,545 --> 03:07:04,379
...and it's a thousand foot in diameter.

3324
03:07:04,547 --> 03:07:07,424
How much sort of detail do you get
on something of this sort of size?

3325
03:07:07,592 --> 03:07:10,176
Of course we'll see the Juggefnaut
has a very specific design...

3326
03:07:10,344 --> 03:07:13,305
...that we were trying to maintain
from the original Alien.

3327
03:07:13,472 --> 03:07:17,434
So we had to go in and put so much
of that little piping detail work...

3328
03:07:17,602 --> 03:07:18,768
...around the exterior.

3329
03:07:18,936 --> 03:07:22,856
The whole Juggefnaut had so much detail
to it to maintain the huge scale that it is.

3330
03:07:23,024 --> 03:07:24,441
HENLEY:
One of the biggest challenges...

3331
03:07:24,609 --> 03:07:26,610
...was understanding the scale
of the Juggernaut...

3332
03:07:26,777 --> 03:07:29,029
...and being able to have the cameraman
visualize that.

3333
03:07:29,196 --> 03:07:31,114
When we brought it back to MPC...

3334
03:07:31,282 --> 03:07:33,700
...and analyze the shots
and laid it out in post-vis...

3335
03:07:33,868 --> 03:07:37,537
...we found that the Juggefnaut
was almost always completely out of frame.

3336
03:07:37,705 --> 03:07:40,415
SCOTT: l'm very happy with the sequence
as it occurs towards the end.

3337
03:07:40,583 --> 03:07:42,709
You know,
because a lot of this is on paper...

3338
03:07:42,877 --> 03:07:45,295
...and you draw it and think...

3339
03:07:45,671 --> 03:07:49,883
...well, if the Juggefnaut was rammed
dy the Prometheus...

3340
03:07:50,051 --> 03:07:54,304
...because the Prometheus has to use itself
as a missile to bring it down...

3341
03:07:54,472 --> 03:07:58,558
...and in so doing, Janek,
the crew and who is left...

3342
03:07:58,726 --> 03:08:00,268
...Chance and Ravel...

3343
03:08:00,436 --> 03:08:05,815
...will sacrifice themselves
for the good of Earth.

3344
03:08:05,983 --> 03:08:10,487
It's that moment where we're
into some pretty big effects work.

3345
03:08:10,655 --> 03:08:13,365
And that whole sequence
is a big one for us.

3346
03:08:13,532 --> 03:08:15,575
The great crumpling motion...

3347
03:08:15,743 --> 03:08:18,703
...as the nose of the Prometheus
rams into the Juggefnaut.

3348
03:08:18,871 --> 03:08:21,498
The way we crumple our ship
against the other one...

3349
03:08:21,666 --> 03:08:25,835
...to make it hold and strengthen
to make it look like there's things inside--

3350
03:08:26,003 --> 03:08:28,171
We have our own destruction tool
here at MPC.

3351
03:08:28,339 --> 03:08:32,008
And we just model invisible objects inside
that's supposed to be the structure...

3352
03:08:32,176 --> 03:08:34,344
...to help it maintain form
while it's being crushed.

3353
03:08:34,512 --> 03:08:37,764
Luckily, inside the ship, there's
not much stuff modeled in the sides...

3354
03:08:37,932 --> 03:08:42,018
...so the explosion comes in pretty quick
and helps us hide the hollowness...

3355
03:08:42,186 --> 03:08:43,937
...of the whole ship.

3356
03:08:44,480 --> 03:08:45,605
STAMMERS:
We pull back and we--

3357
03:08:45,773 --> 03:08:48,441
You know, we're back
with Shaw and Vickers on the ground...

3358
03:08:48,609 --> 03:08:51,027
...and they're witnessing the explosion
up in the sky...

3359
03:08:51,195 --> 03:08:54,989
...and then the debris starts raining down,
and we're into just absolute mayhem.

3360
03:08:55,157 --> 03:08:57,283
PANlS: The Prometheusjust explodes
into billions of pieces.

3361
03:08:57,451 --> 03:08:59,994
Just like pfft, in the air,
and then that's all the pieces...

3362
03:09:00,162 --> 03:09:02,706
...that we have to bring back
in the ground and just explodes.

3363
03:09:02,873 --> 03:09:04,874
And a lot of little debris hitting and it's--

3364
03:09:05,042 --> 03:09:07,001
They escape a few while they're running.

3365
03:09:07,169 --> 03:09:09,838
All these pieces are trying to hit them
and they just dodged them.

3366
03:09:10,005 --> 03:09:11,339
SCOTT:
Of course it doesn't end there.

3367
03:09:11,507 --> 03:09:15,427
The Juggefnaut falls to earth
like a giant horseshoe...

3368
03:09:15,594 --> 03:09:17,387
...and starts to roll.

3369
03:09:17,555 --> 03:09:20,473
DOMENECH: This is post-vis.
That's how we took the plate...

3370
03:09:20,641 --> 03:09:24,227
...and Art and Animation Department,
we made a rough version...

3371
03:09:24,395 --> 03:09:27,147
...of what it would look like
when it's rendered. All this is real.

3372
03:09:27,314 --> 03:09:31,317
And then you guys from Art
added extra pinnacles.

3373
03:09:31,485 --> 03:09:33,570
They're called pinnacles.
They're rock formations.

3374
03:09:33,738 --> 03:09:35,113
They're like volcanic rocks.

3375
03:09:35,281 --> 03:09:37,365
You can see
the explosion elements there.

3376
03:09:37,533 --> 03:09:39,409
You can see the meteorites we added.

3377
03:09:39,577 --> 03:09:41,786
That's the Juggernaut.

3378
03:09:41,954 --> 03:09:44,873
And you can see the pyramids
in the background.

3379
03:09:45,040 --> 03:09:47,417
It's all a virtual environment.

3380
03:09:47,585 --> 03:09:52,505
SCOTT: And l always thought
that's a great idea, but can we pull it off?

3381
03:09:52,673 --> 03:09:56,426
So applying my boards
to their designs of the Juggefnaut...

3382
03:09:56,594 --> 03:09:59,929
...suddenly the whole thing starts
to evolve and become feasible.

3383
03:10:00,097 --> 03:10:03,433
Now it's the most spectacular sequence
of the movie.

3384
03:10:10,941 --> 03:10:11,941
[English - US - SDH]

3385
03:10:19,617 --> 03:10:23,077
THERON: l really feel like it's a movie
that, uh, stands on its own.

3386
03:10:23,245 --> 03:10:27,207
It really doesn't feel like it's trying
to set up a story...

3387
03:10:27,374 --> 03:10:29,042
...or kind of continue a story.

3388
03:10:29,460 --> 03:10:32,754
SCALlA: l felt the way the Alien franchise
was developing...

3389
03:10:32,922 --> 03:10:34,839
...that there was nothing more
for them to say.

3390
03:10:35,007 --> 03:10:39,385
But when he saw an idea
behind this universe and this world...

3391
03:10:39,553 --> 03:10:43,097
...where he could create something
and contribute something new...

3392
03:10:43,265 --> 03:10:44,766
...then he jumped on it.

3393
03:10:44,934 --> 03:10:48,269
SCANLAN: There are strong references,
visual references to the original.

3394
03:10:48,687 --> 03:10:53,274
Whether, ultimately, it links the story
together is not necessary.

3395
03:10:53,442 --> 03:10:57,403
It's not necessary
that this ticks all the boxes.

3396
03:10:57,571 --> 03:11:02,784
I think I'll be allowed to show my face
at Comic-Con next year.

3397
03:11:03,118 --> 03:11:07,539
It was something l was very aware of
as being an enormous responsibility...

3398
03:11:07,706 --> 03:11:11,751
...to the lexicon of sci-fi iconography.

3399
03:11:12,962 --> 03:11:16,631
SCOTT: We began almost two and a half
years ago without a story, without a script...

3400
03:11:16,799 --> 03:11:19,259
...and here we are two years later.

3401
03:11:19,426 --> 03:11:23,638
It's pretty damn good and pretty fast,
given the scale of the production.

3402
03:11:23,806 --> 03:11:25,932
And given the fact
that I was particularly nervous...

3403
03:11:26,100 --> 03:11:30,228
...about returning to the genre
after all this time.

3404
03:11:48,789 --> 03:11:54,002
We got to the point now where we know
what we want to do because we're there.

3405
03:11:54,169 --> 03:11:57,755
We're at about two hours and eight minutes
right now, which is fantastic.

3406
03:11:57,923 --> 03:12:03,052
You might, out of this whole thing,
slender 45 seconds, maybe.

3407
03:12:03,220 --> 03:12:05,597
A minute, if we're lucky.

3408
03:12:05,764 --> 03:12:07,307
So we're really getting to the point...

3409
03:12:07,474 --> 03:12:10,184
...of absolutely fine, fine, fine,
super-fine tuning.

3410
03:12:10,352 --> 03:12:13,354
It really becomes the choice
of the filmmakers...

3411
03:12:13,522 --> 03:12:18,109
...Pietro and I, to finally decide
which hole it's gonna go in through.

3412
03:12:18,277 --> 03:12:19,944
MAN:
Right, that's what it is.

3413
03:12:20,112 --> 03:12:23,156
-Um, and you feel good about it?
-Yeah. l feel very good about it.

3414
03:12:23,324 --> 03:12:25,700
It's very unusual. lt's different.

3415
03:12:25,868 --> 03:12:29,370
The great thing about this film
is it's really, really fresh.

3416
03:12:29,705 --> 03:12:32,874
Because l-- The reason why l didn't do
science fiction for years...

3417
03:12:33,042 --> 03:12:37,420
...was it was a recycling pot
of familiar stuff and familiar ground...

3418
03:12:37,588 --> 03:12:40,590
...and rarely do you have something new.

3419
03:12:40,758 --> 03:12:43,718
And I think what's interesting
about this one is it feels new.

3420
03:12:52,019 --> 03:12:53,353
So you came after all.

3421
03:12:53,520 --> 03:12:57,440
SCALlA: The idea of Prometheus,
the Titan stealing fire from the gods...

3422
03:12:57,608 --> 03:13:00,151
...and giving it to humans,
it's about knowledge.

3423
03:13:00,319 --> 03:13:03,655
It's the same Genesis story
about, uh, Adam and Eve.

3424
03:13:03,822 --> 03:13:06,032
You know, the tree of life,
the knowledge of, uh....

3425
03:13:06,367 --> 03:13:09,118
Answering those questions, that--
The knowledge of the gods.

3426
03:13:09,286 --> 03:13:11,412
Well, we can't. That's the mystery.

3427
03:13:11,580 --> 03:13:15,041
Really, what, uh, fascinated me
was the idea of hubris.

3428
03:13:15,209 --> 03:13:17,919
VICKERS: lf you're really going down there,
you're going to die.

3429
03:13:18,087 --> 03:13:21,005
SCOTT: You know, if you really wanna clip this,
I was wondering...

3430
03:13:21,173 --> 03:13:25,551
...that when you got him going
from her saying, "I am now"...

3431
03:13:25,719 --> 03:13:30,306
...to the screwdriver, what about go--
Cut to the door opening? Voom.

3432
03:13:30,474 --> 03:13:31,766
Then Charlize is standing there.

3433
03:13:31,934 --> 03:13:33,726
SCALlA: lt's a little screwdriver.
-Yeah.

3434
03:13:33,894 --> 03:13:35,728
SCALlA: l thought so. So just cut it--
-Yeah.

3435
03:13:35,896 --> 03:13:37,188
-Just keep it moving.
-Yeah.

3436
03:13:37,356 --> 03:13:39,983
Keep it moving. Yeah.

3437
03:13:44,071 --> 03:13:45,697
You know what? Leave it as it is.

3438
03:13:45,864 --> 03:13:49,575
It almost looks like that screwdriver
opened the door, which is kind of amusing.

3439
03:13:49,743 --> 03:13:53,496
SCALlA: Let me show you.
I mean, I can see it with a fade.

3440
03:13:54,123 --> 03:13:56,708
Better. Better.

3441
03:13:56,875 --> 03:13:58,793
-Better.
SCALlA: Let me add some head, then.

3442
03:13:58,961 --> 03:14:00,420
SCOTT:
Yep.

3443
03:14:01,171 --> 03:14:02,964
This is the Stanley Kubrick scene.

3444
03:14:03,799 --> 03:14:05,383
DAVlD:
Yes, sir.

3445
03:14:06,510 --> 03:14:09,637
SCALlA: Both for me and for Ridley,
for everybody on the film...

3446
03:14:09,805 --> 03:14:12,265
...it was a learning process
to go through this stage.

3447
03:14:12,433 --> 03:14:19,147
Now, this, uh, is a fully digital show,
shot on Red Epic digital cameras.

3448
03:14:19,314 --> 03:14:22,316
SCOTT:
You've still got to be careful with, uh, digital...

3449
03:14:22,484 --> 03:14:25,737
...because you think,
"There it is. Fantastic. Looks great."

how we would import the images...

3453
03:14:38,417 --> 03:14:42,253
...and, uh, there's a whole other step
on the set...

3454
03:14:42,421 --> 03:14:47,175
...in terms of ingesting, you know,
the, uh, raw media files...

3455
03:14:47,342 --> 03:14:49,927
...putting them in stereo,
giving it back to editorial.

3456
03:14:50,095 --> 03:14:51,846
We would be working in HD.

multiple cameras, you know...

...almost 5K resolution...

3459

I mean, it really adds up quickly.

A superior species, no doubt.

3461
03:15:05,402 --> 03:15:09,155
SCALlA: For me, the most important thing
was to watch dailies in 3D...

3462
03:15:09,323 --> 03:15:12,408
...to really get the sense
of what these 3D images would look like.

3463
03:15:12,576 --> 03:15:16,162
We had a great, you know,
60-inch screen.

3464
03:15:16,330 --> 03:15:19,415
I had all my monitors balanced
and color graded properly...

3465
03:15:19,583 --> 03:15:21,626
...so that what Ridley would see
on the set...

3466
03:15:21,794 --> 03:15:24,712
...or what Darek would see on the set
would be exactly the same...

3467
03:15:24,880 --> 03:15:26,214
...as we would see in dailies.

3468
03:15:26,381 --> 03:15:29,008
I just remembered the first 3D shot
that we put up...

3469
03:15:29,176 --> 03:15:32,386
...and I saw is David
putting his hand up in dark...

3470
03:15:32,554 --> 03:15:34,388
...and the door opens up
and he walks in.

3471
03:15:34,556 --> 03:15:36,390
And it's such a beautiful shot,
just in 3D.

3472
03:15:36,558 --> 03:15:37,809
And it was like, "Ah."

3473
03:15:37,976 --> 03:15:41,020
You know that feeling that's just like,
"Oh, great. This is gonna be great."

3474
03:15:41,188 --> 03:15:44,774
It was like literally just opening the door
into this world...

3475
03:15:44,942 --> 03:15:46,567
...and you're gonna go with it.

3476
03:15:46,735 --> 03:15:49,153
And Ridley saw it and he was like,
"This is gonna be cool."

3477
03:15:51,156 --> 03:15:54,117
The first cut, I have to say,
that, uh, unlike some other films...

3478
03:15:54,284 --> 03:15:57,203
...actually came together, uh, rather quickly...

3479
03:15:57,371 --> 03:15:59,872
...and, uh, it wasn't extremely long.

3480
03:16:00,040 --> 03:16:03,084
I think it was probably slightly
over two and a half hours.

3481
03:16:03,252 --> 03:16:06,254
Whereas usually the pictures always end up
like around three.

3482
03:16:06,421 --> 03:16:09,423
It was very easy for me to go back
and make the first cut...

3483
03:16:09,591 --> 03:16:11,050

There's no problem.

I was always aiming to make it, obviously,
a lot shorter than that.

3489
03:16:25,607 --> 03:16:28,609
I mean, I think that the goal was always
to be around two hours.

3490
03:16:30,404 --> 03:16:31,779
The first stage of that cut...

3491
03:16:31,947 --> 03:16:34,949
...of taking the next half hour out
from two and a half...

3492
03:16:35,117 --> 03:16:36,951
...1 5 minutes is fairly easy...

3493

...because certain scenes
become really apparent that you don't need.

3494
03:16:40,622 --> 03:16:42,290
For example,
the Janek and Vickers scene...

3495
03:16:42,457 --> 03:16:44,458
...because the movie
was going somewhere else...

3496

on the brakes then, so--

of Marc Streitenfeld...

3613
03:23:10,971 --> 03:23:12,513
...for the last three or four movies...

3614

for us this time.

This has been a real challenge for him...

3616

...because it's become a combination
of symphonic.

3617
03:23:19,938 --> 03:23:22,690
Marc comes from a point of view
of having marvelous sounds.

3618

He's got great sounds in his head,
not just musical things.

He applies sounds to music,
and I kind of like that way of thinking.

But in this instance, you've gotta--

3621
03:23:33,118 --> 03:23:36,996

that part of it has to be symphonic.

that I wrote really early on...

3623

and sound ideas that l heard.

this pulsating sound.

In a way it's beautiful, but in another way,
it's very aggressive and violent.

3628

with, you know, the Engineers.

Something more, um, ethereal...

In his face, you actually see
that this means something to him.

he has an expectation of something.

to keep alive through the film...

It wasn't about copying that,

attacking somebody.

3758
03:32:08,382 --> 03:32:12,219
You want him to be scary.
You want him to be powerful.

3759
03:32:12,386 --> 03:32:15,055
So you use certain sounds
that will do that.

3760
03:32:15,223 --> 03:32:17,224
And we would give weight
to a lot of things...

3761
03:32:17,391 --> 03:32:20,519
...like if, you know, a big tentacle
slaps the side of the thing...

3762
03:32:20,686 --> 03:32:22,562
...it's gonna be fat.

3763
03:32:24,732 --> 03:32:26,691
I did watch the original Alien,
but what l did--

3764
03:32:26,859 --> 03:32:28,777
So I had it on my iPhone
and I listened to it...

3765
03:32:28,945 --> 03:32:31,029
...without even watching it,
a couple times through.

3766
03:32:31,197 --> 03:32:35,242
Just to see what things stood out to me,
or what things were unique.

3767
03:32:35,409 --> 03:32:37,160
Ian Holm gets his head ripped off...

3768
03:32:37,328 --> 03:32:40,330
...or David in Prometheus
gets his head ripped off.

3769
03:32:40,498 --> 03:32:42,582
The voice changes
because it's no longer connected...

3770
03:32:42,750 --> 03:32:44,543
...to the mother computer board
anymore.

I know.

Have a good journey, Mr. Weyland.

3773
03:32:50,758 --> 03:32:52,217
I filled my mouth with water...

3774
03:32:52,385 --> 03:32:55,011
...and just put a microphone
and gaggled and garbled...

3775
03:32:55,179 --> 03:32:58,557
...and that made this kind of sticky,
wet sound that we processed.

3776
03:32:58,724 --> 03:33:01,268
It just makes a little, like, electronic.

3777
03:33:01,435 --> 03:33:03,728
DAVlD [ON RECORDlNG]:
Have a good journey, Mr. Weyland.

3778
03:33:03,896 --> 03:33:05,647
-Turn the speakers a little bit.
-Problem is--

3779
03:33:05,815 --> 03:33:08,608
I think it's-- What's actually a reenactment
from this moment on...

3780
03:33:08,776 --> 03:33:11,278
...because he really becomes a machine.

3781
03:33:11,445 --> 03:33:15,115
DAVlD: Have a good journey, Mr. Weyland.
STOECKlNGER: Does this change?

3782
03:33:15,283 --> 03:33:17,951
-I like when you add this.
DAVlD: Mr. Weyland.

3783
03:33:19,453 --> 03:33:22,330
Have a good journey, Mr. Weyland.

3784
03:33:22,498 --> 03:33:24,749
-That's that flutter.
-Yeah. Yeah.

Paradise.

3786
03:33:27,086 --> 03:33:30,338
STOECKlNGER: We used all sorts of things
they might have used in 1 979.

3787
03:33:30,506 --> 03:33:32,799
Guitar pedals and weird flanging units...

3788
03:33:32,967 --> 03:33:37,470
...to affect David's voice
to make it sound severed and weird.

3789
03:33:37,638 --> 03:33:40,932
Nowadays, we deal with computers
and evertyhing is automated.

3790
03:33:41,100 --> 03:33:42,851
Well, guitar pedals aren't automated.

3791
03:33:43,019 --> 03:33:44,978
So every time it would go
through the chain...

3792
03:33:45,146 --> 03:33:46,313
...it would change for Ron...

3793
03:33:46,480 --> 03:33:49,232
...and he was adjusting it,
or I was back there adjusting it.

3794
03:33:49,400 --> 03:33:53,820
And so it was like a live performance
at times, just mixing in the movie.

3795
03:33:53,988 --> 03:33:56,573
HEMPHlLL: The way Ridley likes to work
when he mixes is...

3796
03:33:56,741 --> 03:33:59,659
...we've obviously got a lot of material,
a zillion tracks and whatever...

3797
03:33:59,827 --> 03:34:02,329
...but we wants to go and flow.

3798
03:34:02,496 --> 03:34:04,164
He doesn't wanna, you know,
stop and start.

3799
03:34:04,332 --> 03:34:08,084
He wants to see what happens
and see us perform with sound.

3800
03:34:08,252 --> 03:34:11,963
That if we make mistakes, fine,
but it's all about the concepts.

3801
03:34:12,131 --> 03:34:14,674
You finesse--
You can finesse later, whatever...

3802
03:34:14,842 --> 03:34:16,092
...but get the concepts right.

3803
03:34:16,260 --> 03:34:18,053
So the tempo is very fast with Ridley.

3804
03:34:18,221 --> 03:34:19,763
You have to be audience.

3805
03:34:19,931 --> 03:34:22,682
You have to watch the movie
as an audience and respond to it.

3806
03:34:23,017 --> 03:34:25,352
We're not technicians.
That's not what we do.

3807
03:34:25,519 --> 03:34:28,271
We're moviegoers and we're storytellers.

3808
03:34:28,439 --> 03:34:31,274
And we watch that film,
we put our hearts into it...

3809
03:34:31,442 --> 03:34:33,526
...and what the characters are doing,
what's going on.

3810
03:34:33,694 --> 03:34:37,280
And we mix it
as if we were an audience member.

3814
03:34:49,335 --> 03:34:54,547
KEENE: The original Alien film was one
of the most influential movies of all time.

3815
03:34:54,715 --> 03:34:58,969
So there is always gonna be a lot
of lnternet buzz, a lot of fan buzz...

3816
03:34:59,428 --> 03:35:03,932
...about, you know, effectively, you know,
Ridley making a new Alien film.

3817
03:35:04,100 --> 03:35:06,643
FASSBENDER: It's almost become
its own mythology, you know.

3818
03:35:06,811 --> 03:35:09,187
That first film had such a huge impact...

3819
03:35:09,480 --> 03:35:12,482
...and sparked the imagination
of a whole fan base...

3820
03:35:12,650 --> 03:35:14,526
...that they've remained loyal to it.

3821
03:35:14,694 --> 03:35:20,907
This is what l found with sci-fi-comic-book-
superhero sort of fans, they're very vocal fans.

3822
03:35:21,075 --> 03:35:24,661
And they're also very passionate,

I think there's something
so incredibly special and undeniable...

3826
03:35:34,422 --> 03:35:37,173
...when you have a fan base
who loves the genre.

3827
03:35:38,092 --> 03:35:41,428
ELLENBERG: The speculation on the lnternet
for the movie has been, frankly, fantastic.

3828
03:35:41,595 --> 03:35:44,973
It's been interesting to us, occasionally
amusing when there's really strange stuff...

3829
03:35:45,141 --> 03:35:48,435
...but showed how much both passion
there is for the subject...

3830
03:35:48,602 --> 03:35:51,104
...how deeply the previous movies
had affected people...

3831
03:35:51,272 --> 03:35:54,065
...and what yearning there was
not just to see those stories continue...

3832
03:35:54,233 --> 03:35:58,570
...but frankly, to see that quality
and level of science fiction return.

3833
03:35:58,738 --> 03:36:00,947
SPAIHTS: It was the first time
I had touched something...

3834
03:36:01,115 --> 03:36:04,034
...that was so alive in the imagination
of a fan base...

3835
03:36:04,201 --> 03:36:07,620
...that people were anticipating it
long before it came out.

3836

and even, like, slips of the lip...

03:36:12,293 --> 03:36:17,339
...by which l might divulge plot details,
had monetary value, had cultural value.

3838
03:36:17,506 --> 03:36:20,633
People were ravenous for them
and making stuff up on the web.

3839
03:36:20,801 --> 03:36:25,013
And this is the first time that l had ever sat
in my room by myself thinking...

3840
03:36:25,181 --> 03:36:27,807
...knowing that there were tens
of thousands of people out there...

3841
03:36:27,975 --> 03:36:30,643
...wondering what l was up to,
and waiting to see it.

3842
03:36:30,811 --> 03:36:32,812
And that's a very different way to write.

3843
03:36:32,980 --> 03:36:36,316
I've been coming to the Con
since, uh, the mid-'90s.

3844
03:36:36,484 --> 03:36:39,319
And I waited in line
like much of you did, uh...

...to get into this room
and others like it...

3846
03:36:42,073 --> 03:36:46,701
...and, uh, although it's pretty awesome
to be up here presenting to you guys...

3847
03:36:46,869 --> 03:36:51,581
...I just want you to know that my heart
and soul are still in the audience.

3848

LlNDELOF:
If you put 1 0 fans...

3849
03:36:53,542 --> 03:36:58,630
...people who just know the Alien franchise
backwards and forwards in a room...

3850
03:36:58,798 --> 03:37:01,674
...and you basically present to them,
"We'd like to do this."

3851
03:37:01,842 --> 03:37:04,552
There's no single idea
where you will get...

3852
03:37:04,720 --> 03:37:09,015
...you know, 1 0 of them to say unanimously,
"That is a rad idea.

3853
03:37:09,183 --> 03:37:11,351
We're on board with that."
You get frozen by indecision.

3854
03:37:11,519 --> 03:37:15,063
So at the end of the day, you basically say,
"l'm a representative of this jury.

3855
03:37:15,231 --> 03:37:16,523
I'm the foreman.

3856
03:37:16,690 --> 03:37:18,525
And since l'm a fan of Alien...

3857
03:37:18,692 --> 03:37:21,277
...if it can get by me,
then l'm gonna be okay with it."

3858
03:37:21,445 --> 03:37:25,198
And the fact of the matter is, the last thing
that Ridley Scott wants to do...

3859
03:37:25,366 --> 03:37:28,952
...is piss off the people who, essentially,
for the last 25 years...

3860
03:37:29,120 --> 03:37:31,037
...like, sort of idolized this movie.

-Anybody interested?

03:37:48,222 --> 03:37:51,224
Prometheus attempts at giving an answer.

3864
03:37:51,392 --> 03:37:54,561
It's a bold statement
to say what we're saying in this film.

because we get to bring it back...

3866
03:37:57,982 --> 03:38:04,028
...with philosophical questions
and not another take on this creature.

THERON: Ultimately, if we were ever
in a circumstance...

3868
03:38:07,241 --> 03:38:11,119
...where we got that close
to understanding where we come from...

3869
03:38:11,287 --> 03:38:16,082
...I think the biggest question would be,
how do you adapt from what you thought...

3870
03:38:16,250 --> 03:38:21,212
...or what you were taught to believe,
or what your faith tells you believe?

3871
03:38:21,380 --> 03:38:25,758
Perhaps the whole thread of, uh,
this movie...

3872
03:38:25,926 --> 03:38:30,680
...is a cautionary tale
about the perils of playing God.

that's what's--

3875
03:38:37,021 --> 03:38:40,607
We're on Alien,
and it just happens to be different.

3876
03:38:40,774 --> 03:38:45,445
It was 30 years ago he made the first one.
It's coming back to a bit of history for him.

3877
03:38:46,572 --> 03:38:49,449
PEARCE: Ridley is definitely a visual director.
There's no doubt about it.

3878
03:38:49,617 --> 03:38:51,534
I mean,
he has the most extraordinary vision.

3879
03:38:51,702 --> 03:38:56,956
He really is able to create worlds
that other people can't.

3880
03:38:57,124 --> 03:38:59,125
But not at the expense of the actors.

3881
03:38:59,793 --> 03:39:03,630
SCOTT: We have all these funny little ideas
and they all kind of start to interconnect.

3882
03:39:03,797 --> 03:39:05,089
That's the most enjoyable moment.

3883
03:39:05,257 --> 03:39:08,384
I think that's what is marvelous
about my job.

3884
03:39:08,552 --> 03:39:13,389
People say, "Well, you've been on this now
for 14 months and almost at delivery.

3885
03:39:13,557 --> 03:39:15,308
It's pretty quick for this kind of movie.

3886
03:39:15,476 --> 03:39:19,229
Do you never get bored?"
And I said, "Never, ever get bored...

3887
03:39:19,396 --> 03:39:21,731
...because every day
has a whole new set of problems."

3888
03:39:23,984 --> 03:39:27,111
You get to see your conception
comes together...

that ball and make it beautiful.

the ending of Prometheus?
