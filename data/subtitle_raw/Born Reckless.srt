- Hi!
- How's Charlie?

27
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,369
- Oh, he'll live.
- He took a bad spill.

28
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,647
This is not much but..

29
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,449
You're awfully generous, Kelly.

30
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:38,709
Uh, Charlie might have rode
the limit if that bronc

31
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,453
hadn't been so spooky.

32
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,713
Charlie won't be doing nothing for a while.

33
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,524
Yeah, that's why I figured
you'd be needing this.

34
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,328
You can read a girl's mind
better than that.

35
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,465

37
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:10,207
Had a tough fight.

38
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:13,286

away from that kind of fight.

a real nice hand there.

You ride, you rope, you sing.

76
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,502
You've got more talent than I thought.

77
00:06:43,638 --> 00:06:45,905
- Anything else?
- Alright, I give up.

78
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
You can let go now.

79
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,654
Now, Jackie, that's out of character.

80
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:52,511
You could win top prize money
with me any time, any place.

81
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:53,971
And before we get to Panamint

82
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,373
I'd written enough copy
to make you the hottest

83
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,050
rodeo queen in the whole circuit.

84
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,377
That's only the second
thing you have in mind.

85
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,579
What's the matter, baby,
don't you like to see

86
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:02,721
your name in the newspapers?

87
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:03,914
You couldn't put it in large

88
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,725
enough print.
Now get your hands off!

89
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:08,161
Sure.

90
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:10,730
Ow.

91
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,268
Hey, Charlie!

92
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,470
Five, I get your ten,
he don't rope that girl.

93
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:19,730
You gotta bet.

94
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,174
No!

95
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,676
No!

96
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,136
Help!

97
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:27,146
Let me go.

98
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,349
Get off.

99
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,549
Mark Wilson.

100
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,560
Now, son, you shouldn't do that.
Not to a known sports writer.

101
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:44,297
You loss him up, we can't do
a good job writing about this.

102
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,431
You don't do that.
We don't sell tickets.

103
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,826
We don't get any money
in the kitty proprietary.

104
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:51,570
We don't get any prizes,
we don't eats well.

105
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:16,429
Go back, get the wagon.

106
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,021
I'd like to saddle my hands on that

107
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:43,596
rope spinning trick riding little...

108
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,892
Then you saw me ride today?

109
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:50,287
Yeah, I saw you ride.

110
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,823
Lady, next time keep sitting in the saddle.

111
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,291
Maybe guys don't get such a good look.

112
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,702
You don't get yourself
in such a tight spot.

113
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,171
I'm sorry, I got you into it.

114
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,840
But thanks for helping me out.

115
00:09:02,577 --> 00:09:04,777
You can drop me off at the nearest bus stop

116
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,237
or something.

117
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:07,680
I'll be alright.

118
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:12,910
And Mister.

119
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,519
You'd better keep sitting in the saddle

120
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,914
next time you ride, too.

121
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:19,858
Maybe you won't get to eat so much dirt.

122
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:13,713
- Cool Man!
- Eve, honey!

123
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,950
Hi, Eve. How are you doing?

124
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:21,712
Jackie Adams. Eve Tuttle.

125
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,856
- Hello, Eve.
- Jackie.

126
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,317
- What?
- Oh no, this is strictly co-op.

127
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:27,526
Everybody on their own.

128
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:29,520
Well, in that case you take number six

129
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,330
and you two take number 44.

130
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:34,133
Okay. I'm not sleepy.
Take care of the horses.

131
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:35,592
- I'm gonna wander.
- Yeah.

132
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:36,927
- See you in the morning.
- Sure thing.

133
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:40,473
- Kelly, mind if I wander, too?
- Sure, why not.

134
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,207
Goodnight, see you in the morning.

135
00:10:42,343 --> 00:10:43,709
Goodnight.

136
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:50,883
- How've things been?
- Sometimes we eat.

137
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:54,487
Sometimes we think about
the things we ain't got to eat.

138
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,089
Kelly, has he been behaving himself?

139
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,749
Well, you know Kelly.

140
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,026
At least we keep moving.

141
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,354
Or somebody's aim is pretty bad.

142
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:06,991
Oh now, Eve, you know Kelly
ain't got them kinda bad habit.

143
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,701
Sure.

144
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,436
Well, how's things between you and Kelly?

145
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:12,732
Well, I guess you'd say we're

146
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,966
just between eating and thinking.

147
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:17,768
Well, stop thinking and point
Kelly to Little River.

148
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,404
They're having a big
frontier rodeo up there.

149
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:21,780
Locals.

150
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,842
Kelly oughta walk away with the whole town.

151
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,018
Locals?

152
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,380
Locals?

153
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,382
I didn't know they held rodeos here.

154
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:32,792
Yeah, pulled it last season.

155
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,561
Let's sit down.

156
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,804
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

157
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:50,009
Cool Man and I worked just two seasons ago.

158
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:51,802
We did pretty good.

159
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:54,747
Eve's husband,
he, uh... didn't do so well.

160
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,449
Fell off a horse and broke his neck.

161
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,820
- You're chilly?
- Hmm-mm.

162
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:03,823
Thanks.

163
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,860
Like an empty battlefield out there.

164
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:13,065
Yeah, sometimes you take
a little blood, leave a little.

165
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:17,628
I saw you ride the other day.

166
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:19,905
Yeah, I guess I did eat
a mouthful of dirt at that.

167
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,298
For a minute, I didn't think

168
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,234
you'd walk away from that Brahma.

169
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:24,977
And neither did I.

170
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,880
Seems like... each time
I walk away a little slower.

171
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,184
Why do you, Kelly?

172
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:32,443
Why do I what?

173
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:33,853
Stay in it?

174
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,056
Ah, lots of reasons I guess.

175
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:40,325
Name one that's worth getting buried for?

176
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:43,996
I'd sort of be unhappy if I got
buried with my pockets empty.

177
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:45,522
It'd hurt my pride.

178
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:46,924
It'd hurt your pride a lot more

179
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,068
if they couldn't bury you all in one piece.

180
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:52,930
Well, to tell the truth
I figure I got three

181
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,274
maybe four more good years left in me.

182
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,411
So, one day I don't walk away
from a bull or a horse.

183
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,671
I end up like Cool Man.

184
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:03,274
Twisted ribs, broken bones.

185
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:06,152
A hole big enough to stick your
fist in it from a steer's horn.

186
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:09,546
When that happens,
I want to have enough put away

187
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,690
so that I can let my aching body to rest

188
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:13,759
in a nice piece of land
I've got picked out.

189
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:18,089
Yeah, I got me a real sweet

190
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:20,633
little piece of land all picked out.

191
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:24,070
If you live that long.

192
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:28,508
I'll live that long.

193
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,518
- Name?
- Kelly Cobb.

194
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,322
'Not from around
these parts, huh, friend?'

195
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,783
'Ah, you might say a little bit
from every place.'

196
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:47,153
Why? What's that got
to do with it?

197
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:50,395
Oh, now, don't go get
in your horns up at me, friend.

198
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:52,265
I'm just running this week.

199
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,800
The Mayor here, he makes all of the rules.

200
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,869
'He wants to keep
it a family affair.'

201
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,138
'All the contestants
local from town.'

202
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:02,875
I don't figure our entry money's
smell is too different.

203
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,610
Exactly what I was thinking.
Weren't you, Mayor?

204
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,588
Isn't that what you were thinking, Mayor?

205
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:19,817
Hmm-mm. I w-was.

206
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:22,219
You see, friend, no discrimination.

207
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,863
That'll be 20 dollars.

208
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,962
And there's a special $10 entry

209
00:14:30,972 --> 00:14:33,564
for the big two horse race for the day.

210
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:35,508
That lets us out.

211
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:37,434
You're not so local yourself.
Are you?

212
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,004
'It's for the top prize money,
friends.'

213
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,814
Kelly, wait a minute.

214
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,378
Oh, Jackie, I can't take your money.

215
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:49,155
Forget it, you pay me back.

216
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:58,789
How would you like to win that?

217
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,833
Yeah, in the roping contest.

218
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:09,342
'Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.'

219
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:12,011
'A great big western
welcome to you all.'

220
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:15,280
'To the Frontier Days rodeo
here in Little River.'

221
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,017
'We've got the top hands from
the surrounding country here'

222
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:20,678
and they're going to be
competing for top money

223
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:24,015
on the toughest broncs, bulls
and steers that we could find.

224
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:25,358
'You're all in for a large size'

225
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:28,093
'afternoon of thrills,
stills and spills.'

226
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:30,389
'Now, ladies and gentlemen,
on our afternoon's program'

227
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:32,431
'it's the cowboys saddle back riding'

228
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:35,626
'and it looks as if the first
boy is about ready to come out.'

229
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:38,771
'Yes, he is, and here he comes.'

230
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:45,244
'Little Dave getting
stumbled up. That's it.'

231
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,704
Now, ladies and gentlemen, we are ready

232
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:48,047
for our next bronc rider.

233
00:15:48,182 --> 00:15:51,184
It's a new face to you folks.
It's Kelly Cobb.

234
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:52,985
'He's having a little bit of trouble'

235
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,788
'but he'll be out in a minute
and here he comes.'

236
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:57,522
'And it's Kelly Cobb.'

237
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:05,656
Play with him, Kelly.
Hook a head.

238
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,857
- Ride 'em.
- There it is.

239
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,659
- Ya-a-ay.
- 'It's a money ride.'

240
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:10,535
'For sure,
ladies and gentlemen.'

241
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,805
'Next up is Franky Crawford.'

242
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,539
'Franky is a pretty good boy.'

243
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:19,070
'Oh, man, oh, man,
that was a real spill.'

244
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,605
Too bad, ladies and gentlemen,
we've got a little

245
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:21,814
bull docking coming up.

246
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:24,617
This is the one of the dangerous
events in rodeo

247
00:16:24,752 --> 00:16:26,752
which the cowboy attempts to fist down

248
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:28,545
a fast running steer after diving

249
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:29,755
from the back of his horse.

250
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,424
'These steers
can really break.'

251
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,038
'They can break faster than a turkey'

252
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,760
'on a day before Thanksgiving.'

253
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,166
'And Kelly Cobb
isn't pulling one bit.'

254
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:43,560
'He really nailed that steer
right out of the chute'

255
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,837
'and he's twisting him down.'

256
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:48,040
'Man, is that Kelly Cobb
like greased lightning.'

257
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:51,243
'Looks like he's the one
to beat here today.'

258
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:54,505
'My, my, that doggy there
looks like he ran smack'

259
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,849
'into a butcher's convention.'

260
00:16:56,984 --> 00:16:59,252
'The next dogger out
is Franky Crawford.'

261
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:08,193
'Got some calf ropin'
coming up next, folks.'

262
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:11,264
From here it looks like
Ben Preston, the next roper.

263
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,366
Here he comes after those veal chops.

264
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:28,139
'Oops, Ben's having a little
trouble bring home the bacon.'

265
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:30,283
'Well, it wasn't
that effective, Frank.'

266
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:34,419
'Hey, Maestro.
How 'bout a little waltz music"

267
00:17:44,966 --> 00:17:46,699
'Here comes Slim Turner, folks.'

268
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:50,235
'Slim works in Jenkins' grocery
store here in Little River.'

269
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:52,437
'He's got a hankerin'
to be a big rodeo star.'

270
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:53,764
Oops, then, well

271
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:55,908
keep practicin', boy, keep practicin'.

272
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:03,649
'Well, that Kelly Cobb's
back again.'

273
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:06,177
'And folks, if he keeps on goi"
the way he has been today'

274
00:18:06,187 --> 00:18:09,455
'he'll really be totin' home a
sack full of that green stuff.'

275
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:16,062
'He's got a pair of gats
ropes around the calf's neck.'

276
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,261
'He's down on him now.
He's got him down.'

277
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,372
'He's making his wraps
and tie off.'

278
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:29,474
'There it is. It's time.'

279
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,211
'And it looks like fast time
in anybody's league.'

280
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:36,007
And a time of ten-one,
ladies and gentlemen.

281
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:37,377
Very good time in anyone's league.

282
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,552
'And a hard time
to beat here today.'

283
00:18:41,356 --> 00:18:45,224
'Yes, sir, sure looks like that
man's up to play for keeps.'

284
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,094
'He's got the money
in his pocket right now.'

285
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:52,557
'And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for the big event'

286
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,900
'of today's rodeo.
It's the Roman riding race'

287
00:18:55,036 --> 00:18:57,302
'Standing race.
Four teams in the race.'

288
00:18:57,438 --> 00:19:00,505
'Eight horses.
The boys are warming up now.'

289
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:02,375
'Going on down around.'

290
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,910
'They are really going
to give you a big thrill.'

291
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:06,286
'You want to watch this close.'

292
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,913
'It's the most
difficult thing to do.'

293
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:09,289
'This is a short closed arena.'

294
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,908
'The boys will be standing one foot'

295
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:12,317
'on the back of each horse.'

296
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:14,853
'Very hard, takes tremendous balance'

297
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:16,521
'and skill to do this job.'

298
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,123
'We've got four
of our men there.'

299
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:19,992
'We've got Sandy Lawson, Buck Hughes'

300
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:23,520
'Kelly Cobb and Red Mars.'

301
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,723
'They're about ready now, they're still'

302
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:27,933
'coming down through.
They're into a gallop now.'

303
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:29,402
'There's one up.'

304
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,862
'Watch closely, another boy up.
There's the third'

305
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:33,873
'and then there's the fourth.'

306
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:35,340
'And they're off.'

307
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:38,944
'It's the first turn,
it's Sandy Lawson in the lead.'

308
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,337
'Other boys are going wide.'

309
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,448
'Watch it now, there's
a bunch-up on the turn.'

310
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:49,021
'Watch closely now.
Lawson holding in there.'

311
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:51,490
'Buck Hughes pressing close
after him.'

312
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:54,126
'Lawson still going on down
through there.'

313
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:56,896
Come on.

314
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:58,889
'All the boys
had to pull wide then.'

315
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:00,891
'Speeding so fast.'

316
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,301
'It's Sandy Lawson in the lead.'

317
00:20:02,437 --> 00:20:04,570
'Uh-oh, he was in the lead.'

318
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:08,365
'They're really flying now.'

319
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,168
'It's Buck Hughes,
in the lead now.'

320
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:14,914
'Watch it, Buck,
they're closing up on you.'

321
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,649
'Going down
the back stretch now.'

322
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:25,271
There's a bad spill, ladies and gentlemen.

323
00:20:25,326 --> 00:20:28,094
'It's Buck Hughes, he's hung up.
Trying to get loose.'

324
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:35,468
Yes, he did. He got loose,
ladies and gentlemen.

325
00:20:35,603 --> 00:20:38,329
Buck Hughes is free
and the race is going on.

326
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:39,472
'They're really moving now.'

327
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:42,808
'These boys are really
riding hard.'

328
00:20:42,943 --> 00:20:44,944
'Here they come, coming up.'

329
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,804
- 'One lap to go.'
- Yeah!

330
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:48,539
Yeah, get outta there, Kelly.

331
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:52,017
Kelly Cobb, now coming in
and taking the lead.

332
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:55,288
'It's a very short lead.'

333
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,282
'Kelly Cobb is going to win it,
and he's coming down'

334
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:59,492
'to the wire and it is
Kelly Cobb.'

335
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:00,626
'Your winner!'

336
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:16,575
Big brother Spade.

337
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:19,770
He's gone and the money with him.

338
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,316
Yeah, that's right.
We've been taken.

339
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,250
It's Frontier Day, gentlemen.

340
00:21:25,386 --> 00:21:27,987
And we just got pioneered.

341
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:30,223
Let's go look up the sheriff.

342
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,731
Good lookin' philly.

343
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:49,575
Whoa.

344
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,547
Well, here we go again.

345
00:21:54,682 --> 00:21:56,616
Yeah, but in the opposite direction.

346
00:21:57,952 --> 00:22:00,886
That fellow took the money.
He took it alright.

347
00:22:01,022 --> 00:22:02,821
Took it and took all.

348
00:22:02,957 --> 00:22:04,357
I say that we blow out of here

349
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,026
just as quietly and gently as we can.

350
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:08,601
Well, what's that got to do with us?

351
00:22:08,696 --> 00:22:11,088
I'm the one that sweated out
there for nothing today.

352
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:12,565
Come on, get with it, Kelly boy.

353
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,368
The law just might get the unfriendly idea

354
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,695
we was in with that feller.

355
00:22:17,705 --> 00:22:19,838
Ringers.

356
00:22:19,974 --> 00:22:21,174
Honest, I swear, I thought

357
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:22,775
I just heard somebody shot..

358
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:26,503
Good looking piece of horse flesh.

359
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,614
I bet you got him trained real good.

360
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,726
Have a nice trip, Jafford.

361
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:42,628
I was just admiring the horse.

362
00:22:47,602 --> 00:22:48,602
Darn it.

363
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:05,585

And now, friends, I have a treat for you.

386
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:05,462
We're gonna have a number by a little lady

387
00:25:05,472 --> 00:25:08,473

388
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:10,601

that the Bill Oakie

ever turned anyone away from here hungry.

393

Thank you.

They liked you.
I like you, too.

435
00:27:24,145 --> 00:27:26,012
Come on, let's talk.

436
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:34,353
Yeah, she's over 21.
Maybe she wants a career.

437
00:27:37,624 --> 00:27:39,758
Look, I... my friends...

438
00:27:39,894 --> 00:27:41,294
They'll wait.

439
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:44,297
- Really, I...
- You know, you're pretty good.

440
00:27:46,634 --> 00:27:48,501
How would you like
to work here permanently?

441
00:27:50,505 --> 00:27:53,639
- What do I have to do?
- Sing.

442
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:56,909
What else?

443
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:01,973
Now, child

444
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:04,383
you shouldn't be thinking things like that.

445
00:28:05,186 --> 00:28:07,486
I shouldn't? Father?

446
00:28:28,343 --> 00:28:29,742
'Kelly!

447
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:31,878
'Kelly!'

448
00:28:32,947 --> 00:28:34,881
You better get the wagon ready.

449
00:28:35,683 --> 00:28:37,683
Go on, get moving.

450
00:28:46,361 --> 00:28:47,760
This is getting to be a habit.

451
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,962
That makes it twice
I had to say, "I'm sorry."

452
00:28:50,097 --> 00:28:52,823
Now, the trouble is you don't
know your own strength.

453
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:55,501
For a little girl you pack
an awful lot of manpower.

454
00:28:56,503 --> 00:28:59,304
For you too, Kelly?

455
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,631
I gotta check the wagon.

456
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:03,509
We've got plenty of
night driving to do yet.

457
00:29:21,796 --> 00:29:24,730
Thanks. I'm not very hungry.

458
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:28,401
You can tell me to shut up

459
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:30,603
or stop thinking out loud.

460
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:32,605
But you got a fire burning for Kelly

461
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,607
almost as hot as this one?

462
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:38,878
'Kelly, he's not like
ordinary people.'

463
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:41,914
It takes a wild man to ride a wild horse.

464
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:45,818
He's no different when it comes to women.

465
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:50,089
I know... like a raising
from a coal.

466
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:52,683
Just when you think he might
get the peaceful notion

467
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:55,561
of going the route, it's..

468
00:29:57,232 --> 00:30:00,032
Yeah, when Kelly unseats them,
they hit that ground

469
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:03,769
harder than any bronc can throw 'em.

470
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:07,874
And sometimes that kind of hurt
can last a long time.

471
00:30:10,377 --> 00:30:13,179

506
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:34,653

Grandfather, he believes in the siesta.

512
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:47,666
He says it's healthy
and restful for the body.

513
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:49,727

00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:13,959
You did not bring the money?

522
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:17,296
You did not send any money
for the last six months.

523
00:33:18,565 --> 00:33:19,632
Ups and downs, Papa.

524
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:20,900
I got thrown in Malad City

525
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:22,893
and I hurt my arm, I couldn't rope.

526
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:24,837
Couldn't send you what I didn't win.

527
00:33:24,972 --> 00:33:26,705
And before Malad city

528
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:30,243
when you called me to send you money

529
00:33:30,377 --> 00:33:31,710
you've wrecked then maybe

530
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:33,846
a woman's heart, hey,<i> amigo?</i>

531
00:33:35,582 --> 00:33:36,849
Ah, that was different.

532
00:33:36,984 --> 00:33:39,510
Oh, no. It is no different.

533
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,786
It is money.

534
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:45,190
From Red Bluff, you sent me $300.

535
00:33:45,326 --> 00:33:48,861
From Angel's Camp you borrowed back $200.

536
00:33:48,996 --> 00:33:50,863
You win again at Santa Maria

537
00:33:50,998 --> 00:33:52,998
and send more money.

538
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:55,534
You get into trouble at Pocatello

539
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,503
then you come to Reno.

540
00:33:58,806 --> 00:34:00,940
Ah, Kelly Cobb.

541
00:34:01,075 --> 00:34:02,275
I dreamed that some day

542
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:05,611
we are able to buy that land out there.

543
00:34:05,746 --> 00:34:07,346
That you and I, we raise

544
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:09,682
a good-blooded cattle.

545
00:34:09,817 --> 00:34:11,542
Horses, too, maybe.

546
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:13,486
Like the one you are riding.

547
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:16,021
But how are we gonna go this?

548
00:34:16,157 --> 00:34:17,823
If you send, you borrow

549
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,358
you send, you borrow?

550
00:34:19,494 --> 00:34:22,295
Hm, pretty soon you're gonna
borrow more than you send.

551
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,762
Then what?

552
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:25,298
We have nothing.

553
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,901
Um, Papa, I, uh..

554
00:34:29,036 --> 00:34:32,229
- How much?
- Entry fees for tomorrow.

555
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,340
<i>Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay..</i>

556
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:47,778
Hey, that's it, Tom.

557
00:34:47,788 --> 00:34:50,656
Calf ropin', bareback, bull doggin'

558
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:52,257
saddle broncs and brahmas.

559
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:54,393
Hey, going the whole
route, this time, eh, Kelly?

560
00:34:54,529 --> 00:34:55,853
Yeah.

561
00:34:55,863 --> 00:34:57,997
Tell me, what are you planning
to do between events?

562
00:34:58,132 --> 00:35:00,132
- Pray.
- Well.

563
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:02,134
With some of the bulls we got
around here, ride

564
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:04,136
that might not be a bad idea.

565
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:05,863
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

566
00:35:05,873 --> 00:35:08,574
- Number 30.
- See you in the arena.

567
00:35:51,118 --> 00:35:52,552
'He's beautiful.'

568
00:35:55,256 --> 00:35:57,156
What you got against living?

569
00:36:00,195 --> 00:36:03,996
- So, it talks.
- He's a bad one.

570
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:05,322
'He's got spooks running loose in him'

571
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:07,099
'from his feet to his brain.'

572
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:10,136
What's it like to ride him?

573
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:13,506
To be on his back?

574
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:17,342
Like you stop living for 10 seconds.

575
00:36:17,478 --> 00:36:19,870
Your head comes off, and you can't think.

576
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,881
Can't breathe.

577
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:24,483
You go blind until it's all over.

578
00:37:13,668 --> 00:37:15,734
Do you still think he's beautiful?

579
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,503
I know somebody that is.

580
00:37:20,141 --> 00:37:24,001
- What are you selling?
- Les Hunter.

581
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:27,138
What is that, a name or a new tranquilizer?

582
00:37:27,148 --> 00:37:29,148
I'd hate to think of it
putting you to sleep.

583
00:37:31,218 --> 00:37:32,618
Well, I doubt that.

584
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:36,322
What do you do?
Rope or... ride?

585
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:38,749
Rope a little.

586
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:41,552
In the spectator's manner of speaking.

587
00:37:41,562 --> 00:37:43,154
I see.

588
00:37:43,164 --> 00:37:45,898
Oh, no. No, you don't see.

589
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:48,634
I've got a winter home here.

590
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,970
My ex-husband was very generous.

591
00:37:51,105 --> 00:37:52,505
So was I.

592
00:37:56,643 --> 00:37:59,212
Well, one good turn deserves another.

593
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:02,315
This yours, too?

594
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:03,549
Mm-hm.

595
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:07,486
I'm having a little party before the rodeo.

596
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:12,183
Wanna drive me home?

597
00:38:12,193 --> 00:38:13,626
I have to work for a living.

598
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:16,295
I'll let you.

599
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:21,634
Kelly!

600
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:27,732
You, uh, you go ahead
and take care of things.

601
00:38:27,742 --> 00:38:30,042
'I'll see you both back
at the ranch later on.'

602
00:38:55,703 --> 00:38:56,894
Alright, I know.

603
00:38:56,904 --> 00:39:00,573

Alright, kids, everybody go to bed.

649
00:43:15,362 --> 00:43:18,631
You dream the same dream as Kelly, baby.

650
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:21,901
How do you dream dreams
with your eyes open, Papa?

651
00:43:22,036 --> 00:43:24,904
Well, sometimes it is the best way.

652
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:27,673
You can see what you want in your dream.

653
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:34,580
I dream someday all this
belong to Kelly and I.

654
00:43:34,715 --> 00:43:37,783
I save hard to put away my share.

655
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:39,118
And Kelly?

656
00:43:40,254 --> 00:43:41,912
I know he wants it, too.

657
00:43:41,922 --> 00:43:44,657
But sometimes his eyes are shut too tight.

658
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:48,060
Not the way he went off
with that little dream today.

659
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:50,329
His eyes weren't shut.

660
00:43:51,398 --> 00:43:52,798
He will wake up.

661
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:57,470
You didn't see this dream, Papa.
Right out of a bedtime story.

662
00:43:57,605 --> 00:43:59,472
But not for children.

663
00:44:00,275 --> 00:44:02,533
I don't know, Papa.

664
00:44:02,543 --> 00:44:04,802
With me I get whistles and propositions

665
00:44:04,812 --> 00:44:06,812
from all the wrong characters.

666
00:44:06,947 --> 00:44:09,982
From Kelly, all I get is protection.

667
00:44:11,552 --> 00:44:15,521
What haven't I got
that low-down saddle red wants?

668
00:44:17,024 --> 00:44:18,491
You wait.

669
00:44:18,626 --> 00:44:20,293
Kelly will open his eyes and then...

670
00:44:20,427 --> 00:44:22,628
Then it can be too late.

671
00:44:22,763 --> 00:44:25,356
I don't want the man I marry
in this business.

672
00:44:25,366 --> 00:44:26,832
I know I'm in it.

673
00:44:26,968 --> 00:44:28,501
I'm not on the outside looking in

674
00:44:28,635 --> 00:44:30,703
where all the Kelly's look glamorous.

675
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:34,507
I've seen too many of 'em
hit the dirt and lay there

676
00:44:34,642 --> 00:44:35,774
and never get up.

677
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,645
- Not Kelly.
- Who says, Papa?

678
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,114
I want Kelly in one piece.

679
00:44:42,249 --> 00:44:45,518
I want him to enjoy
the kind of life I can give him.

680
00:44:45,652 --> 00:44:47,920
I don't want him living it in a wheelchair.

681
00:44:49,324 --> 00:44:53,359
Kelly's indestructible.
One of the iron men.

682
00:44:54,461 --> 00:44:55,728
Like Cool Man?

683
00:44:57,198 --> 00:44:59,131
Maybe after tomorrow

684
00:44:59,266 --> 00:45:00,666
and Kelly wins

685
00:45:00,801 --> 00:45:03,436
maybe we'll come closer to our dreams.

686
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:05,538
Maybe, Papa.

687
00:45:06,341 --> 00:45:07,940
Maybe.

688
00:45:19,286 --> 00:45:20,953
'Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.'

689
00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:23,014
'It's a big day
here at Panamint.'

690
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:26,483
'As the Grand Entry Plate
starts off the first day'

691
00:45:26,493 --> 00:45:28,019
'of our two-day rodeo'

692
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:29,828
'of what promises to be the biggest'

693
00:45:29,964 --> 00:45:32,231
'most exciting rodeo
in the whole rodeo circuit.'

694
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:35,034
'With contestants
competing for prize stakes'

695
00:45:35,169 --> 00:45:37,102
'that few other
rodeos can match.'

696
00:45:37,238 --> 00:45:39,172
'You name any state in the union'

697
00:45:39,306 --> 00:45:40,497
'and we've got a cowboy'

698
00:45:40,507 --> 00:45:42,099
'representing that state
here today.'

699
00:45:42,109 --> 00:45:43,701
'And they'll be riding the Brahmans'

700
00:45:43,711 --> 00:45:45,236
the barebacks,
the saddle broncs.'

701
00:45:45,246 --> 00:45:48,181
'They'll be doing calf roping
and bulldogging.'

702
00:45:52,387 --> 00:45:55,646
Stop worrying, he'll be here.

703
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:58,249
Too much prize money for him not to show.

704
00:45:58,259 --> 00:46:00,517
I'm not worried.

705
00:46:00,527 --> 00:46:03,320
Peanuts, peanuts, popcorn.

706
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,598
Peanuts. Peanuts.

707
00:46:10,871 --> 00:46:13,664
'We have assembled here today
some of the finest women riders'

708
00:46:13,674 --> 00:46:15,274
'in the country,
ladies and gentlemen.'

709
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:18,669
And we present the first event
of the afternoon

710
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:20,871
Worlds Championship Tele-Pole Trick Riding

711
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:23,148
'in the women's division.'

712
00:46:23,284 --> 00:46:25,551
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

713
00:46:28,823 --> 00:46:30,890
Each Callahan tryin' to outride
these ladies'

714
00:46:31,025 --> 00:46:33,225
'will be giving some
pretty good riding lessons.'

715
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,028
'Yes, siree, folks, these girls
don't take a back saddle'

716
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:37,530
'to no man.'

717
00:46:39,033 --> 00:46:42,568
'And now, for the first girl
out here is Mara Haynes.'

718
00:46:45,572 --> 00:46:47,773
'There goes little Joan Kirk,
ladies and gentlemen.'

719
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:49,308
'Little,
but what a big performer.'

720
00:46:49,444 --> 00:46:50,968
'Look at the girl ride.'

721
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:52,044
'And here's Jackie Adams.'

722
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:53,646
'And when it comes to trick riding'

723
00:46:53,781 --> 00:46:56,573
'That Jackie sure knows
all the tricks.'

724
00:46:56,583 --> 00:47:01,386
'And now out there in the center
of the field comes Bell Vince.'

725
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:06,717
'Well, now, you just try that
on your hobby horse.'

726
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:08,861
'There goes Jackie Adams again,
folks.'

727
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:12,064
'And Jackie handles that horse
like it was a baby carriage.'

728
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:15,468
'Looks like this girl's gonna
wrap up all the high points.'

729
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,875
'How'd you like that,
ladies and gentlemen?'

730
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,609
'Wasn't that something?'

731
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:33,544
A trial riding on four feet,
a horn dynamite today, folks

732
00:47:33,554 --> 00:47:35,154
and there you go.

733
00:47:44,765 --> 00:47:46,157
'And now, friends, we're gonna have'

734
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:50,769
'the wild and woolly
Brahma bull.'

735
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,574
'Comin' out of the chutes now
is Bert Johnson.'

736
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:58,978
'Bert's got himself straddled
to Blind Fury and believe me'

737
00:47:59,113 --> 00:48:03,516
'Blind Fury can't see Bert
for dust.'

738
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:10,723
Tonight, Kelly baby.

739
00:48:10,858 --> 00:48:14,727
Only tonight Liz sees that you behaved.

740
00:48:14,862 --> 00:48:17,930
That you're nice to Liz.

741
00:48:22,803 --> 00:48:25,104
That's for not being nice to Liz.

742
00:48:39,754 --> 00:48:41,254
Just remember.

743
00:48:43,758 --> 00:48:45,816
'And next, comin' out of chute four'

744
00:48:45,826 --> 00:48:47,818
'Chuck Appleton from Calgary.'

745
00:48:47,828 --> 00:48:49,795
'Boy, look at that man go.'

746
00:48:57,838 --> 00:48:59,504
'Well, comin' out of chute number 10'

747
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,033
'I see the last man
up on the Brahmas today'

748
00:49:02,043 --> 00:49:05,177
'is Johnny Morgan
from Stockton, California.'

749
00:49:05,312 --> 00:49:07,580
'Johnny tied the record
for calf ropin' last year.'

750
00:49:07,715 --> 00:49:09,782
'Now, let's see if he can
outride this Brahma.'

751
00:49:18,393 --> 00:49:20,918
That's one event
you can scratch for the day.

752
00:49:20,928 --> 00:49:22,795
Maybe you're lucky at that.

753
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,398
'Folks, these bulls
must be fed on split atoms'

754
00:49:25,532 --> 00:49:26,924
'the way they explode.'

755
00:49:26,934 --> 00:49:28,459
'You just don't take
your life in your hands'

756
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:32,405
'when you ride these express
trains, you give it away.'

757
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:35,074
'Well, we've got another one of
those gentle four-legged beasts'

758
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:37,143
'mounted and ready to go.'

759
00:49:40,081 --> 00:49:43,082
'Next to a Brahma these broncs
are pretty dangerous fellas.'

760
00:49:43,217 --> 00:49:46,886
'They go north, south, east
or west all at the same time.'

761
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:02,835
Well, we got another one of
these gentle four-legged beasts

762
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:05,362
mounted and ready to go.

763
00:50:05,372 --> 00:50:07,106
And he's gone.

764
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,648
'Oh-oh, he's got his foot
caught in his stirrup.'

765
00:50:15,783 --> 00:50:17,382
'Good footwork there.'

766
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:21,378
'Next rider up is Kelly Cobb.'

767
00:50:21,388 --> 00:50:24,223
'Looks like Kelly's ready now
and he's comin' out.'

768
00:50:38,005 --> 00:50:39,664
'I guess Kelly forgot
to do one of his tricks'

769
00:50:39,674 --> 00:50:42,775
'and can that soft ground
can be pretty hard.'

770
00:50:50,285 --> 00:50:53,419
'Well, he's shaky, but we don't
hear any bones rattle.'

771
00:50:58,425 --> 00:51:01,460
'Kelly's up now to try
his luck at calf roping.'

772
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:12,638
'Guess that rope
just wasn't long enough, huh?'

773
00:51:12,773 --> 00:51:14,431
'Kelly lost.'

774
00:51:14,441 --> 00:51:16,441
'One of the trickiest of all bronc riding'

775
00:51:16,577 --> 00:51:17,977
'is the bareback event.'

776
00:51:18,112 --> 00:51:20,112
'You really don't have too much to sit on'

777
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:22,815
'and it's a question as to
who can hold on the longest.'

778
00:51:34,395 --> 00:51:37,864
'Well, I guess Kelly decided
to sit this one out.'

779
00:51:42,003 --> 00:51:43,260
'Comin' up now, ladies and gentlemen'

780
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:44,737
'is a bulldoggin' event.'

781
00:51:44,872 --> 00:51:46,539
'This requires perfect teamwork'

782
00:51:46,674 --> 00:51:49,742
'careful skill and timing
on the part of the cowboy'

783
00:51:49,877 --> 00:51:51,544
'who must stow the steer
to the ground.'

784
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,870
'And the utmost precision'

785
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,548
'and riding on the part
of his hazer.'

786
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:05,191
That sure got a big hunk of beef
dropped down on him.

787
00:52:10,365 --> 00:52:12,097
'But while the boys are checking over Judd'

788
00:52:12,233 --> 00:52:13,966
'next comin' out is Cool Man Edwardson'

789
00:52:14,101 --> 00:52:16,093
'to saddle the hay
for Kelly Cobb.'

790
00:52:16,103 --> 00:52:18,237
'Kelly seems to be
a little off his stride today.'

791
00:52:18,373 --> 00:52:19,572
'But today isn't over yet.'

792
00:52:19,707 --> 00:52:21,506
Maybe you'd better let that one pass

793
00:52:21,642 --> 00:52:24,035
before you pass out.

794
00:52:24,045 --> 00:52:26,379
You don't wanna haze for me,
just forget it.

795
00:52:26,513 --> 00:52:29,482
Somebody's got to see
that you don't get killed.

796
00:52:52,206 --> 00:52:54,873
'Here they are,
Cool Man and Kelly.'

797
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:06,919
You alright?

798
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,824
I'm sorry, I missed.

799
00:53:17,031 --> 00:53:18,555
'That was a close one alright'

800
00:53:18,565 --> 00:53:20,633
'but Cool Man is up,
and he's walking away from it.'

801
00:53:20,768 --> 00:53:24,971
'No, sir, you can't keep an old
hound dog like Cool Man down.'

802
00:53:31,646 --> 00:53:35,514
- We're quite a team, alright.
- So I blew today.

803
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:38,109
You got something to say, say it!

804
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:40,385
- I gotta be some place.
- Sure, you do.

805
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:43,722
But don't explain that to me,
explain it to Jackie.

806
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:46,383
Oh, so that's how it is.

807
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:47,860
No, it ain't how it is.

808
00:53:47,995 --> 00:53:50,062
So, I'm a louse.
Now, can I go?

809
00:53:50,197 --> 00:53:51,856
I got something important to take care of.

810
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:53,357
So have I.

811
00:53:53,367 --> 00:53:54,733
You!

812
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:57,202
I beat my brains out for you.

813
00:53:57,338 --> 00:54:00,005
I picked you up shoveling out stables.

814
00:54:00,141 --> 00:54:01,674
I taught you everything I know.

815
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:04,810
I wanted you to be even better than I was.

816
00:54:04,945 --> 00:54:08,806
Every time you come out of
a chute, I come out again, too.

817
00:54:08,816 --> 00:54:12,618
Every time you went the ride on
the bull, I rode the limit, too.

818
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:15,488
Every time you got
your brains scrambled on a bronc

819
00:54:15,622 --> 00:54:18,757
I got a headache.
It was worth it.

820
00:54:18,893 --> 00:54:20,960
I wanted you to be great.

821
00:54:21,095 --> 00:54:25,131
The only thing I couldn't
teach you was how to be human.

822
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:29,502
- I'll talk to you later.
- I'll talk to you now.

823
00:54:29,636 --> 00:54:31,704
I've seen you fracture lots of hearts.

824
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,907
But every time I see you walkin'
over that kid, the way you have

825
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:38,511
wavin' that cheap saddle trash
in front of her eyes..

826
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:47,386
I'm sorry, partner.

827
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:25,558
Tonight, Kelly baby.

828
00:55:25,693 --> 00:55:29,762
Only tonight Liz sees that you behaved.

829
00:55:29,897 --> 00:55:33,065
That you're really nice to Liz.

830
00:55:37,038 --> 00:55:39,572
That's for not being nice to Liz.

831
00:55:47,715 --> 00:55:49,115
Just remember.

832
00:56:15,142 --> 00:56:17,334
You wanna drink?
Maybe to forget.

833
00:56:17,344 --> 00:56:19,211
Hmm, no, thanks, Papa.
That wouldn't help.

834
00:56:19,346 --> 00:56:20,671
It help me forget.

835
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:23,616
Ooh, would I ever forget that rodeo today?

836
00:56:23,751 --> 00:56:24,875
That Kelly! Whew!

837
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:28,087
Yeah, Kelly, you-you can say that again.

838
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:31,290
You know what he did?
He hit me.

839
00:56:31,426 --> 00:56:33,284
That's what he did.

840
00:56:33,294 --> 00:56:35,086
My friend!

841
00:56:35,096 --> 00:56:38,231
And me, I taught him all he knows.

842
00:56:38,365 --> 00:56:40,365
Every time he rides

843
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:42,768
I ride again, too.

844
00:56:42,903 --> 00:56:46,497
Every time he wins, I win again, too.

845
00:56:46,507 --> 00:56:51,043
Every time he gets thrown
and crawls in the dirt, I cry.

846
00:56:51,178 --> 00:56:53,979
It's the same thing my friend Kelly does.

847
00:56:54,115 --> 00:56:55,581
But you know what?

848
00:56:55,716 --> 00:56:59,051
There's one thing I can't do through him.

849
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:01,854
Is make love and break hearts.

850
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:03,456
Or saddle up a cheap tramp.

851
00:57:03,591 --> 00:57:06,926
Cool Man, where is he?
Where's Kelly now?

852
00:57:07,061 --> 00:57:11,264
Probably out breakin'
all records calf ropin'. Heh.

853
00:57:11,398 --> 00:57:13,524
You saved yourself a lot of tears.

854
00:57:13,534 --> 00:57:16,269
- Just forget Kelly Cobb.
- Yeah, that's right.

855
00:57:16,403 --> 00:57:19,530
Take it from an old man.
Forget.

856
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:23,000
And you tell me, can you forget him, Papa?

857
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:25,136
Can you forget your dream?

858
00:57:25,146 --> 00:57:26,545
And you, Cool Man.

859
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:30,341
Can you forget Kelly? Forget all
the good things about him?

860
00:57:30,351 --> 00:57:32,343
Do you want to?

861
00:57:32,353 --> 00:57:35,546
Papa, let me have the keys
to your pick-up truck.

862
00:57:35,556 --> 00:57:36,947
- Oh, they're in the truck.
- Uh, no, Papa.

863
00:57:36,957 --> 00:57:38,949
Don't let her have 'em.
She can't drive.

864
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:41,294
- Why not?
- You're sober, that's why.

865
00:57:41,428 --> 00:57:44,163
You don't know how sober.

866
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,766
Thanks, Papa.

867
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:53,806
My friend, Kelly.

868
00:57:57,044 --> 00:57:58,477
He's a no-good..

869
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,439
...white-bellied, olive-branched

870
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:05,518
side-windin', snake-eyed baloney bull.

871
00:58:05,652 --> 00:58:08,321
- That's what he is.
- <i>Si.</i>

872
00:58:08,455 --> 00:58:09,522
And that's not all.

873
00:58:09,657 --> 00:58:12,291
He's buzzard bait, that's what he is.

874
00:58:15,062 --> 00:58:19,332
Hittin' me the way he did, my friend.

875
00:58:19,466 --> 00:58:21,534
The dirty sage rat.

876
00:58:23,004 --> 00:58:25,062
<i>Si.</i>

877
00:58:25,072 --> 00:58:26,664
You know what I'm gonna do

878
00:58:26,674 --> 00:58:29,675
the next time I see that vulture?

879
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:35,348
I'ma gonna wring his neck
so hard till he starts raspin'

880
00:58:35,482 --> 00:58:37,482
like a turkey gobblin' it's spurs

881
00:58:37,618 --> 00:58:39,276
the night before Thanksgiving.

882
00:58:39,286 --> 00:58:41,478
<i>Si.</i> He-he.

883
00:58:41,488 --> 00:58:45,290
And then I'm gonna spin him around

884
00:58:45,426 --> 00:58:48,227
and whop his lump so hard

885
00:58:48,363 --> 00:58:50,495
that it'll make riding a Brahma bull

886
00:58:50,631 --> 00:58:52,632
seem like a hobby horse.

887
00:59:01,442 --> 00:59:04,443
<i>Si.</i> Ha-ha-ha.

888
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:41,138
Look, I was tossing him down
pretty good last night.

889
00:59:41,148 --> 00:59:43,674
I probably said a lot of things.

890
00:59:43,684 --> 00:59:45,818
Then, I would like to know
if you meant them.

891
00:59:45,953 --> 00:59:48,754
Liz, you're a big girl.
And you've got a big check book.

892
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:52,083
[chuckles I've got a big taste for life.

893
00:59:52,093 --> 00:59:54,359
I'm trying to tell you, Liz,
I don't go with it.

894
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,696
You and me, we're riding
two different horses.

895
00:59:57,832 --> 00:59:59,398
You talk too much.

896
01:00:15,116 --> 01:00:17,450
Well! Company.

897
01:00:17,585 --> 01:00:20,586
You could say that again, girl.

898
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:23,055
Out of my way, you!

899
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:25,458
Jackie, honey, wait a minute.
Let's get this straight.

900
01:00:25,593 --> 01:00:27,059
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

901
01:00:27,194 --> 01:00:29,328
Jackie, baby, I only came here
to say goodbye.

902
01:00:29,464 --> 01:00:31,497
I'll bet you did.

903
01:00:34,469 --> 01:00:36,401
Jackie, please, wait.

904
01:00:41,943 --> 01:00:47,004
- Now look what you've done.
- I haven't started.

905
01:00:47,014 --> 01:00:48,748
What are you gonna do?

906
01:01:01,963 --> 01:01:03,863
Where have I been?

907
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:13,072
- You make me nervous.
- Do I now?

908
01:01:20,247 --> 01:01:22,247
So, cool off!

909
01:01:22,383 --> 01:01:23,716
Both of you!

910
01:01:57,952 --> 01:01:59,485
Go away!

911
01:02:01,488 --> 01:02:02,488
Now.

912
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:08,093
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

913
01:02:08,229 --> 01:02:09,628
Oh, no.

914
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:18,771
Oh, my head. What did
I drink that wine for?

915
01:02:18,906 --> 01:02:20,898
Oh!

916
01:02:20,908 --> 01:02:21,941
Ooh!

917
01:02:24,845 --> 01:02:27,913
Coffee, Mama.
Good and hot.

918
01:02:28,049 --> 01:02:29,707
You're gonna sober up and haze for me today

919
01:02:29,717 --> 01:02:31,909
even if it kills ya.

920
01:02:31,919 --> 01:02:35,846
To be dead would be
such a glorious feeling.

921
01:02:35,856 --> 01:02:38,391
Bite your tongue for saying such a thing.

922
01:02:38,525 --> 01:02:41,394
Oh, even that wouldn't feel better

923
01:02:41,528 --> 01:02:45,198
if I had widen my head.

924
01:02:45,332 --> 01:02:46,432
Drink it.

925
01:02:48,736 --> 01:02:50,102
Where's Jackie?

926
01:02:57,011 --> 01:03:00,479
Uh, she, she did not come back last night.

927
01:03:00,615 --> 01:03:03,282
'So, where is she then?
What happened to her?'

928
01:03:12,026 --> 01:03:14,151
Here, Kelly.

929
01:03:14,161 --> 01:03:15,795
Now it is your turn.

930
01:03:21,102 --> 01:03:23,235
'Well, here we go again,
ladies and gentlemen.'

931
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:25,963
'About to wind up the big
two-day meet here'

932
01:03:25,973 --> 01:03:28,365
'at Panamint's Annual Rodeo.'

933
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:31,302
'And friends, this is the day
that some cowboy's'

934
01:03:31,312 --> 01:03:33,246
'gonna walk away
with all the money.'

935
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:36,849
'And here we go now,
to the calf roping contest.'

936
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:59,338
'Hey, now. That's mighty
fancy roping and tying'

937
01:03:59,474 --> 01:04:02,741
'in the greased lightning time
of, hold on to your seats'

938
01:04:02,877 --> 01:04:04,277
'nine seconds flat.'

939
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:07,079
'And I'd say that's gonna be
the time to beat.'

940
01:04:10,818 --> 01:04:13,686
'Hold on, partner.
Ride 'em up.'

941
01:04:13,821 --> 01:04:16,489
'And here, yes, sir.'

942
01:04:16,624 --> 01:04:19,892
'That was Tommy Parks, folks
and he whipped the lemon.'

943
01:04:20,027 --> 01:04:22,427
'And from where I'm sitting,
it looks like Kelly Cobb'

944
01:04:22,563 --> 01:04:25,198
'is back up in the saddle
for little Bronkey.'

945
01:04:31,238 --> 01:04:32,429
Outside.

946
01:04:32,439 --> 01:04:33,439
Ya!

947
01:04:41,448 --> 01:04:43,640
'Man, he's really glued to that saddle

948
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,651
'like it was his own skin.'

949
01:04:45,786 --> 01:04:48,053
'He rode that biggie
right into the ground.'

950
01:04:48,189 --> 01:04:52,383
'Yup, Kelly's back
in pitching today, alright.'

951
01:04:52,393 --> 01:04:55,328
'And there goes Rob Dotson out
on Flying Death.'

952
01:04:59,334 --> 01:05:01,192
'Boy, you just don't sit down for dinner'

953
01:05:01,202 --> 01:05:03,169
'after riding
one of those, fellows.'

954
01:05:06,341 --> 01:05:09,141
'That steer has rolled over
on him. He might be hurt.'

955
01:05:09,276 --> 01:05:11,644
'Nope. Jake's on his feet.'

956
01:05:16,351 --> 01:05:18,809
'He's doggin' that steer
right into the dirt.'

957
01:05:18,819 --> 01:05:20,019
'Good boy, Jake.'

958
01:05:23,558 --> 01:05:26,692
You look like I felt yesterday.

959
01:05:26,827 --> 01:05:28,361
Don't worry about me.

960
01:05:28,495 --> 01:05:30,555
Well, I don't wanna have to
pick you up off the ground.

961
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:32,198
I can't take the time.

962
01:05:34,169 --> 01:05:36,235
'Well, that's
Georgie Brooks takin' off.'

963
01:05:36,371 --> 01:05:41,707
'And does he ever take off.
Hey, Georgie, where did he go?'

964
01:05:41,842 --> 01:05:42,842
Let's go.

965
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:43,910
'Anyway, folks'

966
01:05:43,978 --> 01:05:45,036
'if you think doggin' a steer'

967
01:05:45,046 --> 01:05:46,837
'racin' at express train speed'

968
01:05:46,847 --> 01:05:48,181
'is easy'

969
01:05:48,315 --> 01:05:49,982
'just don't try.'

970
01:05:50,117 --> 01:05:51,984
Keep your eye on Kelly Cobb, folks.

971
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:53,819
Number 30 out there today.

972
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:57,823
'There they go.'

973
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,660
'Kelly Cobb put that steer down
in the sensational time'

974
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:12,529
'of four and two-tenth seconds
and comin' out of'

975
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:13,931
'chute number nine'

976
01:06:13,941 --> 01:06:16,341
'it's Long Whisker
aboard Savage Man.'

977
01:06:16,477 --> 01:06:17,668
'Go do it, Long.'

978
01:06:17,678 --> 01:06:19,937
That's the buzzard to beat.

979
01:06:19,947 --> 01:06:21,747
I saw him steer a guy
with his horns for good

980
01:06:21,882 --> 01:06:23,416
the day we checked in.

981
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:26,018
You call that spook, Kelly?

982
01:06:26,153 --> 01:06:28,713
You don't know what a nice funeral you had.

983
01:06:28,723 --> 01:06:29,822
Thanks.

984
01:06:31,692 --> 01:06:34,551
'This looks like
a nonstop ride to nowhere.'

985
01:06:34,561 --> 01:06:37,029
'And, man, does that bull
hate people.'

986
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:41,092
'Too bad, Don.
Try him again sometime.'

987
01:06:41,102 --> 01:06:42,760
And now, out of chute number three

988
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:45,905
Kelly Cobb is gonna try out
a pair or two on Black Knight.

989
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,241
'This bull, friends,
holds the world's record'

990
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:51,510
'for throwin' every cowboy
that ever climbed aboard him.'

991
01:06:51,646 --> 01:06:54,914
'He's a killer, folks,
but we got an old saying.'

992
01:06:55,049 --> 01:06:57,783
'That there ain't never a bull
that can't be rode'

993
01:06:57,918 --> 01:07:01,578
'or a cowboy
that can't be thrown.'

994
01:07:01,588 --> 01:07:03,222
Let me know what happened.

995
01:07:04,725 --> 01:07:05,858
Outside.

996
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:17,470
Ride him, Kelly, ride him!

997
01:07:17,605 --> 01:07:20,331
'Kelly Cobb just did
the impossible, folks.'

998
01:07:20,341 --> 01:07:22,808
'And rode that bull until
it's horns shook loose.'

999
01:07:24,279 --> 01:07:26,804
Hi, Jackie.
You've come just in time.

1000
01:07:26,814 --> 01:07:28,948
Our Kelly, he's a new man today.

1001
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:32,685
He's stymieing even the wildest
one into a little kitties.

1002
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:34,745
He better.

1003
01:07:34,755 --> 01:07:37,290
Put another dime in the jukebox, Cool Man.

1004
01:07:37,424 --> 01:07:40,559
- That bull blows a wicked horn.
- That's no property here.

1005
01:07:40,695 --> 01:07:43,296
It's your brain saddlin' back in your head.

1006
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:44,964
You went the limit.

1007
01:07:45,099 --> 01:07:47,232
- I did?
- Sure.

1008
01:07:50,037 --> 01:07:52,371
Where have you been all night?

1009
01:07:52,507 --> 01:07:54,307
Or-or should I ask such a question?

1010
01:07:54,441 --> 01:07:56,509
It's alright, Mama.

1011
01:07:56,644 --> 01:07:59,712
I stayed with a couple of girls
over at the trailer camp.

1012
01:07:59,847 --> 01:08:02,573
Kelly, he worries very bad.

1013
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:05,117
Before I'm through, he'll worry a lot more.

1014
01:08:05,252 --> 01:08:07,252
That is good.

You're the finest looking gal here.

1057
01:11:02,697 --> 01:11:05,097
How about a dance?

1058
01:11:05,232 --> 01:11:06,899
Why not?

1059
01:11:12,573 --> 01:11:15,708
Our little Jackie is growin' up fast.

1060
01:11:15,843 --> 01:11:17,510
Yeah.

1061
01:11:17,644 --> 01:11:19,044
Come on, gang.
The drinks are on me.

1062
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,283
Set 'em up.

1063
01:11:32,793 --> 01:11:37,388
How about a drink for poor
dry-little-old me, Champ?

1064
01:11:37,398 --> 01:11:40,333
Sure, I'll buy a poor
dry-little-old you a drink.

1065
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:43,068
Champ, you had me squeeze my
heart out for you this afternoon

1066
01:11:43,204 --> 01:11:44,662
until it hurt.

1067
01:11:44,672 --> 01:11:45,738
It hurt bad.

1068
01:11:45,873 --> 01:11:47,398
Looks like her luck might run out

1069
01:11:47,408 --> 01:11:49,942
if she gets a live one she can't handle.

1070
01:11:50,077 --> 01:11:52,211
Yeah, I tried seeing her after the rodeo.

1071
01:11:52,347 --> 01:11:54,271
She wouldn't listen to me say I was sorry.

1072
01:11:54,281 --> 01:11:56,874
She kissed me off without a word.

1073
01:11:56,884 --> 01:11:59,076
Well, why cry on your beer?

1074
01:11:59,086 --> 01:12:02,655
- Kiss off on the rocks.
- Anytime you say, champ.

1075
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:07,226
Maybe she's just trying
to make you over-anxious.

1076
01:12:09,564 --> 01:12:10,696
Thanks, father.

1077
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,773
Let's grab a table.

1078
01:12:31,186 --> 01:12:33,386
Ah, let's drink up.

1079
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:52,405
Now, you got yourself quite a gait.

1080
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:54,807
How would you like to
meander over to my place?

1081
01:12:54,942 --> 01:12:56,475
See my new saddle.

1082
01:12:56,611 --> 01:12:59,011
That saddle is already broken in.

1083
01:12:59,146 --> 01:13:00,813
I'm sure it is.

1084
01:13:10,024 --> 01:13:11,490
Excuse me.

1085
01:13:18,099 --> 01:13:20,032
Marky, baby.

1086
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:21,767
Oh, no.

1087
01:13:21,902 --> 01:13:23,560
Marky, honey.

1088
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:26,171
I'm sorry about what happened.

1089
01:13:26,307 --> 01:13:27,907
Really I am.

1090
01:13:28,042 --> 01:13:31,502
Sure I know you couldn't be sorrier.

1091
01:13:31,512 --> 01:13:35,506
You did say I have more talent
than you thought?

1092
01:13:35,516 --> 01:13:39,051
Sure, but that was last week.

1093
01:13:39,186 --> 01:13:43,188
Maybe I've got even more talent this week.

1094
01:13:43,324 --> 01:13:45,182
Where you going to ride next, champ?

1095
01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:47,260
I might just be there.

1096
01:13:47,394 --> 01:13:50,263
- Who said we were leaving?
- Kelly, baby.

1097
01:13:50,397 --> 01:13:52,865
You read a girl's mind.

1098
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,793
You readin' Mark Wilson's mind too?

1099
01:13:55,803 --> 01:13:57,002
Settle back.

1100
01:13:57,138 --> 01:13:58,671
It's too late this time.

1101
01:14:00,475 --> 01:14:03,742
You said you could make me
the<i> hottest</i> rodeo queen

1102
01:14:03,878 --> 01:14:05,402
in the circuit.

1103
01:14:05,412 --> 01:14:08,947
But you said that was only
the<i> second</i> thing I had in mind.

1104
01:14:10,951 --> 01:14:14,687

01:17:30,017 --> 01:17:31,083
Well, finally.

1152
01:17:31,218 --> 01:17:32,409
You better get the wagon warmed up.

1153
01:17:32,419 --> 01:17:33,552
'Kelly.'

1154
01:17:33,688 --> 01:17:35,621
- Excuse me.
- But Kelly..

1155
01:17:47,502 --> 01:17:48,901
That was a rough one.

1156
01:17:49,036 --> 01:17:51,103
When do I ever stop saying I'm sorry.

1157
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:53,906
Pretty quick.
Just as soon as we're married.

1158
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:55,708
<i>'Ole.'</i>

1159
01:17:55,843 --> 01:17:58,836
I-I only want to be like you,
Uncle<i> Senor</i> Kelly.

1160
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:00,838
To ride the bull, rope the calf.

1161
01:18:00,848 --> 01:18:02,181
Just like you, Uncle<i> Senor</i> Kelly.

1162
01:18:16,998 --> 01:18:18,864
Alright. Out you get and off
to bed you go.

1163
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,860
- See you, Uncle<i> Senor</i> Kelly.
- Manuel, wait a minute.

1164
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:24,261
Give this to Papa in the morning.

1165
01:18:24,271 --> 01:18:25,538
It's for him from us.

1166
01:18:25,673 --> 01:18:27,740
Tell him we'll be back.
Tell him that...

1167
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:31,944
Manuel, tell Papa he can dream
his dream for real now.

1168
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:34,547
All our eyes are open.

1169
01:18:34,682 --> 01:18:35,682
I'll tell Papa.

1170
01:18:35,816 --> 01:18:37,950
And when we do come back, Manuel

1171
01:18:38,085 --> 01:18:42,355
we won't be roping calves,
taming broncs, riding bulls

1172
01:18:42,489 --> 01:18:44,156
or dogging steers.

1173
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:46,083
We're gonna grow 'em right here.

1174
01:18:46,093 --> 01:18:49,162
He's right, Manuel. And we'll
need you and your help.

1175
01:18:49,296 --> 01:18:51,364
<i>Si.</i>
