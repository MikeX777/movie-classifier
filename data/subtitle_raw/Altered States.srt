1
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:47,553
The tank itself...

2
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:49,751
...was unusual in that it was vertical...

3
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,286
...and looked like an old boiler.

4
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,160
inside the tank the subject wore
a heavy glass bubble...

5
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:58,894
...and you would have thought the whole
contraption uncomfortable to say the least.

6
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:00,435
it was, however, effective.

7
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,867
of the 23 students tested,
only two found the experience unpleasant.

8
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:07,466
Some even called it exhilarating.

9
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,739
A number of students hallucinated.

10
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,243
Dr. Jessup found the encephalographic
evidence especially interesting.

11
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,578
And one Saturday afternoon, in April 1967...

12
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:20,350
...he decided to try the experience
for himself.

13
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:51,169
Arthur. Hey, Arthur.

14
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:53,443
Are you there?

15
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,683
Can you hear me, Arthur?

16
00:03:57,854 --> 00:03:59,287
Arthur, answer me.

17
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,457
Is that it? You want me
to come in and get you out?

18
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,391
i want to get a look at those EEG tracings.

19
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:01,511
How do you feel?

20
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,146
Not bad.

21
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,510
I hallucinated like a son of a bitch.

22
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:08,684
A variety of dream states, mystical states...

23
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:11,520
...a lot of religious allegory,
mostly out of Revelation.

24
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:13,755
You were in there close to five hours.

25
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:15,021
It felt like an hour.

26
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:16,759
I'd like to try that myself sometime.

27
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,357
You should. You'll like it.

28
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:23,834
Did we have any communication?

29
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:26,801
Sure. I kept checking you out
like you told me to.

30
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,874
How did I respond?

31
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,270
Very orderly.
At one point you were crying.

32
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:33,910
You mean, actually crying?

33
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:36,417
You were sobbing.
There were tears on your face.

34
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:39,814
When I asked you what was going on,
you said you were...

35
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,016
...re-experiencing your father's death.

36
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,620
Did you make notes?

37
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,223
It's all there.

38
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:52,100
I'd like to try this again next week. Do you
think you could make it again next week?

39
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:53,969
What are we looking for?

40
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:57,429
I don't know, yet.

41
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:02,375
There's really very little literature
on this kind of research.

42
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,437
There are some good people in the field:
Tart, Ornstein and Deikman...

43
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:08,746
...but most of it is radical-hip stuff,
drug-culture apologias.

44
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:12,685
Obviously, the first thing to do is
set up some sensible methodology...

45
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:15,781
...study these experiences
under controlled laboratory conditions.

46
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:18,190
It won't interfere with the work
we're doing with Hobart.

47
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:21,662
What are we getting into?
Sensory deprivation? Isolation studies?

48
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:24,165
I mean, where will we be going
with the tank stuff?

49
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:27,031
We're not writing up a grant.
Strictly bootlegging, just for kicks.

50
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,162
We've got the use of this tank.
Let's play with it.

51
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:31,138
Let's find out where it takes us.

52
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,103
It's fascinating stuff.
I think we ought to get into it.

53
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,908
I didn't even know they had one of those
isolation tanks at New York Hospital.

54
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,951
Must be some guy
in the Psychology Department...

55
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,850
...doing sensory deprivation studies.

56
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:47,856
What's Jessup doing with it?

57
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:52,426
You've got me. He's been taking students
out of his classes and testing them.

58
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,725
He's been doing this for three, four months.

59
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
Did you know...

60
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,664
...Jessup was into this kind of stuff?

61
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:00,326
Not until you just told me.

62
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:01,961
What do you want?

63
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:04,097
How long are you going to let it ring?

64
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,368
It's okay, I'll get it.

65
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:08,334
He's the last guy in the world I figured...

66
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:12,541
...to be screwing around with anything
as flaky as altered states of consciousness.

67
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:15,778
Let's face it. Jessup is pretty flaky himself.

68
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:19,413
That's him.

69
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:43,103
Arthur says you're very shy.
He wants me to draw you out.

70
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:46,077
Draw me out?
That doesn't sound like Arthur.

71
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,985
Well, what he actually said was
you were a high-handed, arrogant prick.

72
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:52,114
A little nuts, but brilliant...

73
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:55,720
...and that if I ever got you talking,
I would find you fascinating.

74
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:57,720
That sounds more like Arthur.

75
00:07:57,793 --> 00:08:01,058
He says you're doing some work with him
and Alan Hobart at Payne-Whitney.

76
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,290
What sort of work?

77
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:04,392
Toxic metabolite stuff.

78
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:06,594
We're replicating Heath's
and Friedhoff's strategies...

79
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:09,331
...trying to find maverick substances
specific to schizophrenia.

80
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,669
I think we're chasing our tails.
What do you do?

81
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,437
I'm a physical anthropologist.
I'm sweating out my dissertation.

82
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,340
Where?

83
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:16,577
Columbia.

84
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:18,546
Holloway, and that bunch.

85
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,572
You're kind of young for a Ph.D.,
aren't you?

86
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm 24.

87
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,111
That's still pretty good.

88
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:28,419
I didn't get my Ph.D. until I was 25.
I'm supposed to be a whiz kid.

89
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:30,992
I'm a whiz kid, too.

90
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:39,434
Anthropology seems to attract
good-Iooking women.

91
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:46,068
So you don't think schizophrenia can be
reduced to a single etiological agent?

92
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,909
I'm not even sure it's a disease.

93
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,145
You think madness is simply
another state of consciousness?

94
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:54,615
There's a body of evidence to support that.

95
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:58,919
You don't like to talk
about your work, do you?

96
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:00,114
As a rule, no.

97
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:09,597
I'm interested in interior experiences,
especially the religious experience.

98
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,963
The only reason I'm working
with schizophrenics now...

99
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:15,629
...is the religious experience is
so significant in schizophrenia.

100
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:17,963
There's only so much
you can do with animals.

101
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,098
I worked with monkeys...

102
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:21,575
...but they can't tell you what goes on
in their consciousness.

103
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,544
You need human beings for that.

104
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:27,407
You can't ablate human beings,
nor stick electrodes in their skulls...

105
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,815
...so I have to use
a trance-inducing technique...

106
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:32,718
...and the isolation tank seemed
the least risky.

107
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:36,554
And I'd like to go home with you tonight.
Would that be all right with you?

108
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:40,623
I've got a roommate.
We'll be confined to the living-room couch.

109
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:44,124
What's wrong with the living-room couch?

110
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,164
You tend to slip off a lot.

111
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:48,935
I'm sure we'll manage.

112
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:50,834
I'm sure we will.

113
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:57,340
So, whenever you want to go there,
you let me know.

114
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,645
How about right now?

115
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:17,929
What are you thinking about?

116
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:19,223
God...

117
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,868
...Jesus, crucifixions.

118
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:31,603
As a rule, do you usually think about
Christ and crucifixions under sexual stress?

119
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:41,312
When I was nine years old,
I used to see visions...

120
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,518
...visions of saints and angels,
even Christ himself.

121
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,832
Of course I don't do that anymore...

122
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,296
...not since I was 16.

123
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:00,031
Were your parents religious?

124
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:01,977
Anything but.

125
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:06,745
My father was an aeronautical engineer.
My mother, a clinical psychologist.

126
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,075
What happened?

127
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:12,678
I mean, how did a little kid who saw
visions of Christ turn into a physiologist...

128
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,019
...teaching at the Cornell Medical College?

129
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,755
I stopped believing.

130
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:18,050
It was very dramatic.

131
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:22,257
My father died a protracted
and painful death of cancer.

132
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:27,092
I was 16 years old
and very fond of my father.

133
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:29,933
I used to race to the hospital
every day after school...

134
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:33,200
...and sit in his room doing my homework.

135
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,610
He was very heavily sedated.

136
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:37,875
The last few weeks he was in coma.

137
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:44,283
One day I thought
I heard him say something.

138
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:47,283
I got up and leaned over him...

139
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,984
...my ear an inch away from his lips.

140
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,991
"Did you say something, Pop?"

141
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,696
Then I heard the word he was desperately
trying to say, a soft hiss of a word.

142
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:01,100
He was saying...

143
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:05,765
"...terrible..."

144
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:15,441
"...terrible."

145
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:21,948
So the end was terrible,
even for the good people like my father.

146
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:25,016
So the purpose of all our suffering
was just more suffering.

147
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:32,594
By dinner time, I had dispensed with God
altogether. I never saw another vision.

148
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:39,506
I haven't told anybody
about this in 10 years.

149
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:45,305
I'm telling you now
because I want you to know...

150
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:48,676
...what sort of a nut
you might be getting mixed up with.

151
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,681
Arthur was right.

152
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:55,254
You are a fascinating bastard.

153
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:28,302
Well, it's settled.

154
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:32,143
Metcalfe spoke to Spencer again this
morning and it's definite. The job's mine.

155
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:34,876
I'll be in Nairobi doing
my post-doc work July and August...

156
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,145
...and in September,
I'll be teaching at Harvard.

157
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:38,277
Terrific.

158
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:42,450
It looks like we'll both be teaching
at Harvard in September.

159
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,991
Looks that way.

160
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:48,756
You can't get any tidier than that, can you?

161
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:55,498
We're going to be together in Boston
and I think we should get married.

162
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,673
You know, of course,
I'm supposed to be at least a little bit nuts.

163
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:01,903
A little bit?

164
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:03,842
You're an unmitigated madman!

165
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:10,010
You don't have to tell me how weird
you are. I know how weird you are!

166
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,281
I'm the girl in your bed
the past two months.

167
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:15,118
Even sex is a mystical experience for you.

168
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:18,418
You carry on like a flagellant,
which can be very nice...

169
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:21,054
...but I sometimes wonder
if it's me that's being made love to.

170
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,998
I feel like I'm being harpooned by some
raging monk in the act of receiving God.

171
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:34,670
And you are a Faust freak, Eddie.
You'd sell your soul to find the great Truth.

172
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:38,336
Well, human life doesn't have great truths.

173
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:42,510
We're born in doubt. We spend our lives
persuading ourselves we're alive.

174
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,712
And one way we do that is
we love each other, like I love you.

175
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,181
I can't imagine living without you.

176
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,782
So let's get married.

177
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:53,359
If it turns out to be a disaster,
it'll be a disaster.

178
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,329
We'll shake hands and say goodbye.

179
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,565
He's giving her dimethyltryptamine.

180
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,599
It takes effect in about a minute
and she'll trip out for about half an hour.

181
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:16,544
Do you feel different now?

182
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:19,613
Less anxious?

183
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:21,688
Much less.

184
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:23,924
Do you have any special feelings?

185
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:25,285
I feel...

186
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:28,891
...like my heart is being touched by Christ.

187
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,077
There's a lot of religious delusion
among acute schizophrenics.

188
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,544
Some guys say schizophrenics are
physically different from the rest of us.

189
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,181
It's almost as if they were trying
to change their physical selves to...

190
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,918
...adapt to their schizophrenic image
of themselves.

191
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,228
All right, we'll get married,
since it's that important to you.

192
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,799
I'm not comfortable with women...

193
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:15,742
...and I'm not likely to find anyone
half as remarkable as you again.

194
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:19,111
I think I can make
a reasonably good husband.

195
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,480
I don't want to lose you, you see.

196
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:30,154
I suppose that's the closest thing to
a declaration of love I'll ever get out of you.

197
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:43,968
Am I really that weird in bed?

198
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:45,403
Sometimes.

199
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:49,276
Shall I try to change?

200
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:51,243
No, I kind of like it.

201
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:18,064
-Daddy, I'm tired.
-We'll give the little lady a ride!

202
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,505
Hey, Mason, be careful.

203
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:22,201
How you doin', Eddie?

204
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:23,904
Hi, Mason. How about a beer?

205
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:33,585
-lf I didn't see this, I wouldn't believe it!
-You were supposed to come next week!

206
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:49,304
Look at the family man!
Oh, Eddie, you look so good!

207
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:50,360
I don't believe it.

208
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,600
Not again? When did this happen?

209
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:54,198
Well, it's a long story.

210
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:56,344
Have you found a place yet?

211
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:59,105
We got a nice little place
near Huntington Field.

212
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:01,510
We moved to San Francisco
seven years ago.

213
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,414
Arthur is going to teach at Boston U.

214
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:04,984
I can't believe it's been seven years.

215
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:07,180
I hear you just got associate professor.

216
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:09,013
You guys must be loaded!

217
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:11,992
We've got a place in Maine
you can use for the summer.

218
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,551
I'm going to Africa again in June.
Eddie will be in Mexico.

219
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,258
Do you know a guy named Eccheverria,
University of Mexico?

220
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:18,560
Says he worked with you.

221
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,033
Sure. A very bright young guy.

222
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:22,866
He's here at the Botanical Museum.
We'll all have to get together.

223
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:25,338
I'm going back to Mexico with him in June.

224
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:26,396
What's in Mexico?

225
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,774
Eccheverria's got this witch doctor
down there, the Hinchi Indians.

226
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:32,672
They're an isolated tribe in Central Mexico
who still practice...

227
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:36,411
...the ancient Toltec rituals, sacred
mushroom ceremonies, that kind of thing.

228
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:39,186
Apparently they use some kind
of hallucinatory drug...

229
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:42,451
...that is supposed to evoke
a common experience in all users.

230
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,620
Maggie has fallen asleep on the couch.
Will you take care of her?

231
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,364
Did you ever get into an isolation tank
since New York?

232
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:51,763
No. Did you?

233
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,631
No, but I just found out
there's one here at the Medical School.

234
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:57,570
I didn't think anybody was doing
those kind of studies anymore.

235
00:20:57,639 --> 00:20:59,630
We did some interesting stuff in that tank...

236
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,233
...in New York for the few months
we played around with it.

237
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:05,280
Maybe when I get back from Mexico
we'll get into it again.

238
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,541
Why not?

239
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,154
A terrific housekeeper she's not.

240
00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:21,294
They're getting a divorce, you know.

241
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:24,698
-I don't know if they're getting--
-What are you talking about?

242
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:26,927
She and the kids are moving to Cambridge.

243
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:28,401
That's why this place is such a mess.

244
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,904
They're moving her stuff
into storage tomorrow.

245
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,011
Then she's going off to Africa
for a year with the kids.

246
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,842
And he's going to Mexico.

247
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:42,472
When she comes back, she's going
to live in Cambridge and he's staying here.

248
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,212
It's he who wants the divorce, not her.

249
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:46,652
I'm surprised they stayed together
this long.

250
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,321
When did all this happen?

251
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,324
She just told me five minutes ago.

252
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:54,026
What about the letters she kept writing us
about how happy they were?

253
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:57,327
Don't ask me. She's still crazy about him.
He's still crazy.

254
00:22:08,977 --> 00:22:11,502
Sylvia just told me
you're getting a divorce.

255
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,142
We're getting separated.

256
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:17,242
We probably won't get around
to the divorce until next year.

257
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,415
I know it's none of my business, but why?

258
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:23,947
You're married to a great woman
who adores you.

259
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:26,290
My God, if anybody has it made, you have.

260
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,355
You're a respected and admired figure...

261
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,628
...a full professor on the faculty
of the Harvard Medical School.

262
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:37,294
For God's sake, is that how you imagine
me? A respected and admired figure?

263
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,967
A devoted father? A loving husband?

264
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:43,808
Well, I've also published nearly two papers
a year for the last seven years...

265
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:46,473
...and not a fundamental piece of work
in the lot.

266
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:50,550
I sit around the living rooms
of other young married faculty members...

267
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:54,248
...talking infantile masturbation, who's
sucking up to the head of the department...

268
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:56,654
...whose tenure is hanging by a thread.

269
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:59,520
Emily is content to go on with this life.

270
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:02,221
She insists she's in love with me,
whatever that is.

271
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:05,226
What she means is
she prefers the senseless pain...

272
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,858
...we inflict on each other to the pain...

273
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:09,301
...we would otherwise inflict on ourselves...

274
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,470
...but I'm not afraid of that solitary pain.

275
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:18,170
If I don't strip myself of all this clatter
and clutter and ridiculous ritual...

276
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,741
...I shall go out of my fucking mind!

277
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,044
Does that answer your question, Arthur?

278
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,518
What question was that?

279
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,519
You asked me why I was getting divorced.

280
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,318
Listen, it's your life.

281
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,156
I'm sorry I even asked.

282
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:37,156
Why don't I call Eccheverria
and we'll all go out and have some dinner?

283
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:42,660
As a matter of fact, Eduardo,
my year in India was disappointing.

284
00:23:42,737 --> 00:23:44,204
No matter how you slice it...

285
00:23:44,272 --> 00:23:46,866
...yoga's a state-specific technology
operating in the service of...

286
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:48,341
...an a piori belief system....

287
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,403
We scientists have a moral obligation to
the public as well as to our own research.

288
00:23:52,747 --> 00:23:54,009
It just never occurred to baboons...

289
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:57,848
...that they could shorten that time
to five minutes if they used a stick.

290
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:03,181
Originally, man was just another
savanna-living primate like the baboon.

291
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:08,194
What dignifies the yogic practices is the
belief system itself is not truly religious.

292
00:24:10,098 --> 00:24:11,963
There is no Buddhist god, per se.

293
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:16,800
It is the Self, the individual Mind, that
contains immortality and ultimate Truth.

294
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:18,800
What is not religious about that?

295
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,104
You've simply replaced God
with the original Self.

296
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:22,370
Yes, but we've localized it.

297
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:24,503
Now I know where the Self is.
It's in our own minds.

298
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:27,912
It's a form of human energy.
Our atoms are six billion years old.

299
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:31,475
We've got six billion years
of memory in our minds.

300
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:34,615
Memory is energy! It doesn't disappear!
It's still in there!

301
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:37,556
There's a physiological pathway
to our earlier consciousnesses.

302
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:40,652
There has to be.
It's in the goddamned limbic system.

303
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,390
Jessup, you're a whacko!

304
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:45,599
What's whacko about it?
I'm a man in search of his true Self.

305
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:47,999
How archetypically American can you get?

306
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:50,762
Everybody's looking for their true selves.

307
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,330
We're all trying to fulfill ourselves...

308
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:56,310
...understand ourselves,
get in touch with ourselves...

309
00:24:56,378 --> 00:25:00,678
...face the reality of ourselves,
explore ourselves, expand ourselves.

310
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:02,473
Ever since we dispensed with God...

311
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:06,681
...we've got nothing but ourselves
to explain this meaningless horror of life.

312
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:07,981
You're whacko.

313
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:12,420
Well, I think that the true Self...

314
00:25:13,128 --> 00:25:17,724
...that original Self, that first Self,
is a real, mensurate, quantifiable thing...

315
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:20,830
...tangible and incarnate...

316
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,038
...and I'm going to find the fucker.

317
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:50,296
What are their chemical properties?

318
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,122
Are they safe?

319
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:56,762
The mushrooms are almost
certainly amanita muscaria...

320
00:25:57,172 --> 00:26:00,699
...a very powerful psychedelic
and a little dangerous.

321
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:04,573
It contains belladonna, alkaloids...

322
00:26:04,946 --> 00:26:07,005
...atropine, scopolamine.

323
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:10,582
The sinicuiche plant is highly regarded...

324
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,485
...among a number of Indian tribes.

325
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,580
I've seen it as far north as Chihuahua.

326
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:18,591
The Indians say it evokes old memories...

327
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:21,154
...event ancient ones...

328
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:25,260
...and the Hinchis call it The First Flower.

329
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,227
The first in the sense of primordial?

330
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:30,497
Yes.

331
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,807
In the sense of the most ancient.

332
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:35,139
I'd like to try it.

333
00:26:37,045 --> 00:26:39,707
Do you think they would
let me join in their ritual?

334
00:26:40,915 --> 00:26:43,179
Well, they seem like agreeable people.

335
00:26:56,665 --> 00:27:00,226
Est todo bien para ti
participar en la ceremonia.

336
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,968
He says it's all right for you
to participate in their ceremony.

337
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:07,798
Ask him what kind of an experience
I can expect.

338
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:10,542
Are they gathering these mushrooms
for the ritual?

339
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:12,807
No, they're being harvested for next year.

340
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,911
Qué clase de experiencia
puede esperar mi amigo?

341
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:24,216
Su alma regresar a su primera alma.

342
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,157
Your soul will return to the First Soul.

343
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,554
Ask him what this First Soul will look like.

344
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:32,429
?Cómo es la primera alma?

345
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:35,169
Es la ateria increada.

346
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:38,204
It is Unborn Stuff.

347
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:43,734
Entonces, usted se lanzará en el vacio....

348
00:27:44,646 --> 00:27:47,137
Then you will propel into the void.

349
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,349
Usted verá una mancha.

350
00:27:49,818 --> 00:27:51,308
You will see a spot.

351
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,551
La mancha se convertiráen una grieta.

352
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,220
The spot will become a crack.

353
00:27:58,126 --> 00:28:00,219
Esta es la Grieta Entre la Nada...

354
00:28:00,295 --> 00:28:02,729
This is the Crack Between the Nothing...

355
00:28:03,865 --> 00:28:06,265
De esta Nada saldr su Alma increada.

356
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:09,628
...and out of this Nothing will come
your Unborn Soul.

357
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,203
Digale que extienda la palma de la mano.

358
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,743
He wants you to hold the root.
Put out your hand with your palm up.

359
00:30:41,189 --> 00:30:42,486
Are you all right?

360
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:02,331
We only have their word I killed a lizard.

361
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,364
You didn't see it
and I have no recollection of it!

362
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,731
This whole hideous business is
just a joke...

363
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,868
...the Indians have played on me
to make the gringo look like a fool!

364
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:13,880
Look, you asked me what happened
and I told you!

365
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:16,812
You drank the mixture
and you went outside.

366
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,846
After a while there was a scream
and some dogs were barking.

367
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:21,411
I shouted after you.

368
00:37:21,622 --> 00:37:24,216
The screaming stopped.
The brujo yelled at me to come back.

369
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:25,316
Oh, bullshit!

370
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,922
Then why did you ask the brujo to give you
the mixture to take back to Boston?

371
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:33,023
I thought I'd like Arthur to analyze,
maybe synthesize, it.

372
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:37,661
The noise is stupefying.

373
00:37:59,927 --> 00:38:01,986
The sun became black...

374
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:04,124
...as sack cloth.

375
00:38:09,236 --> 00:38:12,364
The full moon became like blood.

376
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:17,369
Then a great mountain burning with fire...

377
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:22,979
...was thrown into the sea.

378
00:38:29,523 --> 00:38:33,254
Then the beast ascends
from the bottomless pit.

379
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:37,659
The angel of the bottomless pit.
His name is...

380
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,164
...Abaddon.

381
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,667
He's off the wall!

382
00:38:48,843 --> 00:38:49,832
Are you okay?

383
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,935
Get this stuff! It's new!

384
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,946
It's deafening! The noise is deafening!

385
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:58,048
Can you hear me above this noise?

386
00:39:00,321 --> 00:39:01,686
The most unbelievable thing I've seen!

387
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,621
I'm watching the birth agony
of a mountain!

388
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,386
Oh, my God.

389
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:08,826
Are you okay?

390
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:13,528
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.

391
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,702
Do you want me to bring you down now?

392
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,229
What happens now?

393
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:23,538
He's blacked out.
These blackouts can get pretty freaky.

394
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,545
Sometimes they last as long as four hours.

395
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:29,174
When he comes out of it, he's as chipper
as a bird, but he doesn't remember a thing.

396
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,242
Just how dangerous is this stuff
he brought back from Mexico?

397
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:34,310
I didn't say dangerous,
just said it was weird.

398
00:39:34,388 --> 00:39:35,480
It hangs around too long...

399
00:39:35,556 --> 00:39:38,684
...and what's really screwy is
it heads straight for the brain.

400
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,851
Well, I don't believe this.

401
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:45,062
You guys are shooting up with an untested
drug that stacks up in the brain...

402
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,226
...and works in the nucleus of the cell
and you don't call that dangerous?

403
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,294
For the record, we don't actually shoot up.

404
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:54,003
-Eddie drinks a 10-milligram....
-It will stop now!

405
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:56,236
You guys are supposed to be
reputable scientists...

406
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,507
...not two kids in the dorm freaking out
on Mexican mushrooms!

407
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,882
Why do you think I called you for?
Let's see you stop him.

408
00:40:11,025 --> 00:40:12,583
This ain't LSD, goddamnit!

409
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:15,253
This is no serotonin antagonist
you're drinking!

410
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,427
How many grams of that stuff
you think you've got in you?

411
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,023
Two? Three?

412
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:23,293
You could be working up
one hell of a case of cancer...

413
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,133
...with all the antimetabolites in you.

414
00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:28,801
The Hinchis have been drinking that stuff
for centuries with no incidence of cancer.

415
00:40:28,876 --> 00:40:30,207
Fuck the Hinchi Indians!

416
00:40:30,277 --> 00:40:32,142
You don't know anything
about those mushrooms!

417
00:40:32,213 --> 00:40:33,976
They seem to have
fantastic staying powers!

418
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,948
We've shot up at least 30 rats
with that stuff.

419
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,950
Some of them have
a whopping load in them...

420
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,486
...and none of them have been
noticeably affected.

421
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:43,146
Where are we going?
We were going to get something to eat.

422
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:44,657
Eddie wants to show me an isolation tank.

423
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:48,456
Isolation tank! You guys get flakier
every time I talk to you!

424
00:40:48,629 --> 00:40:51,427
I thought all that isolation tank stuff
went out in the '60s...

425
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:53,626
...with Timothy Leary
and all them other gurus!

426
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,727
Will you shut up for a minute
and let somebody else say something?

427
00:40:56,804 --> 00:40:58,601
What happens during
these blackout periods is...

428
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:00,731
...you get the feeling
of phenomenal acceleration...

429
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:03,936
...like you're being shot out over millions,
billions of years.

430
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:05,603
Time simply obliterates.

431
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:08,846
You sense the hallucination is going on,
but you get no images.

432
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:10,713
I want to break through
that blackout barrier.

433
00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:14,618
I want to know what those images are
that I know are going on but I can't see.

434
00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:18,124
We can't raise the dosage of the drug
because we're close to toxic levels now.

435
00:41:18,192 --> 00:41:20,524
The only way to intensify
the experience is...

436
00:41:20,594 --> 00:41:22,528
...to take the 200 milligrams
along with the tank.

437
00:41:22,596 --> 00:41:25,326
There's more I'd like to do to that drug
before you take it again.

438
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,866
I'd like to do a half-life determination.

439
00:41:26,934 --> 00:41:28,697
-That would take us a year!
-I'd like to know the transport system.

440
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:30,361
I'd like to find some analogues.

441
00:41:30,437 --> 00:41:33,065
This Mexican stuff
is an extraordinary substance...

442
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,337
...and every instinct I have tells me
I'm onto something hot here...

443
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,402
...and another 200 milligrams
isn't going to kill anybody.

444
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:42,808
There it is.

445
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:47,981
Oh, it's horizontal.

446
00:41:50,057 --> 00:41:52,287
It's smaller than the one
we had in New York.

447
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:55,458
If they're doing sleep studies, it must be....

448
00:41:55,529 --> 00:41:59,124
I don't think anybody's used it in years,
but I checked it out yesterday and it works.

449
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,633
It won't take a week
to get this place cleaned.

450
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:01,668
You could get your ass in a sling...

451
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:04,465
...if it ever gets out you're using
an untested drug on human subjects.

452
00:42:04,538 --> 00:42:06,631
Don't worry.
Nothing's going to happen to me.

453
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:07,865
Let's get a quick hamburger.

454
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,341
I'm seeing one of my students tonight.

455
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,342
All right!

456
00:42:11,645 --> 00:42:15,081
Do what you want to do.
I think you're both irresponsible as hell!

457
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:19,317
Don't call me and tell me you're worried
about Eddie putting all this shit into him!

458
00:42:19,386 --> 00:42:22,446
I'm telling you, don't you put
any more of that shit into him...

459
00:42:22,523 --> 00:42:24,616
...until you know a hell of a lot more
about it!

460
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:27,718
I've offered you the use of my lab
and all the rats you can cut!

461
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,628
That's as much as I want to be implicated
in your dumb experiments!

462
00:42:30,698 --> 00:42:31,824
Go get your own dumb hamburger.

463
00:42:31,899 --> 00:42:34,663
I've already got my own date
I'm an hour late for!

464
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,772
I already did these first three.
You do the rest.

465
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:02,154
Couldn't resist, right?

466
00:43:02,263 --> 00:43:05,232
Well, somebody's got to keep his eye
on you two sorcerers.

467
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,460
What have you got in there,
some kind of salt solution?

468
00:43:08,535 --> 00:43:11,902
Ten percent magnesium sulfate,
for buoyancy.

469
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:15,968
Weird, man.

470
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,617
One, two, three, four.

471
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:27,113
one, two, three, four.

472
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,347
Okay, you're fine.

473
00:43:29,456 --> 00:43:32,948
Wednesday, January 7th, 4:28 P. M.

474
00:43:34,495 --> 00:43:35,962
Hey, this is terrific!

475
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,327
He went into theta like a shot.
No spindling, nothing.

476
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:43,964
Grasslands, savannas.

477
00:43:46,173 --> 00:43:47,606
i feel...

478
00:43:47,975 --> 00:43:50,773
...i am actually alive
and inside this landscape.

479
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:54,972
A density of woodlands about a mile away.

480
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,041
Beyond that,
mountains that seem to be smoking.

481
00:43:58,152 --> 00:44:01,553
Newly born mountains,
Cenozoic, latter Tertiary.

482
00:44:03,624 --> 00:44:05,251
i'm in an edge-area.

483
00:44:05,592 --> 00:44:07,958
Utter tranquility, but alive.

484
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:10,553
Life in the trees. Life in the sedge.

485
00:44:11,498 --> 00:44:12,556
oh, my God...

486
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,199
...the birth of man. That's got to be it!

487
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:19,136
y God! There it is...

488
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:21,808
...a proto-human.

489
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:25,208
The first, and the original
truly human form...

490
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:29,775
...tiny, perhaps 4 feet high,
completely furred...

491
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:32,249
...chimp-like, but erect.

492
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,911
No knuckle walking. Shorter arms.

493
00:44:33,987 --> 00:44:36,251
He's moving along so gracefully.

494
00:44:36,623 --> 00:44:38,557
There's two, three of them.

495
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,991
Bipedal, tiny, little furred
humanoid creatures...

496
00:44:44,064 --> 00:44:46,396
...a chunk of lava in their hands...

497
00:44:48,068 --> 00:44:49,933
...stalking or hunting something.

498
00:44:51,905 --> 00:44:53,497
For Christ's sake.

499
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:56,335
Are you okay, Eddie?

500
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:59,607
i'm becoming one of them.
i'm no longer observing.

501
00:45:01,315 --> 00:45:02,475
i'm one of them.

502
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,855
Killing something, a goat.

503
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,489
i'm killing...

504
00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:13,252
...i'm eating...

505
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:17,028
...i'm eating the blood, hot flesh of a goat.

506
00:45:23,604 --> 00:45:24,730
Are you okay?

507
00:45:25,939 --> 00:45:26,871
Beautiful.

508
00:45:28,442 --> 00:45:30,000
Do you want to come down?

509
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,891
It sounded like he was having
a bad trip to me.

510
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,554
Some of these tank trips can get
pretty creepy.

511
00:45:52,399 --> 00:45:53,889
What the hell was that?

512
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:58,994
Are you okay?

513
00:45:59,973 --> 00:46:00,940
Beautiful.

514
00:46:01,542 --> 00:46:03,032
Do you want to stop this?

515
00:46:03,577 --> 00:46:06,478
-Do you want me to leave you alone?
-Yeah.

516
00:46:23,564 --> 00:46:26,294
I thought you said these things don't last
more than four hours.

517
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,765
It's a quarter to nine.

518
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:29,127
He's coming out.

519
00:46:31,472 --> 00:46:35,238
I don't like being out of contact
for these long periods of time.

520
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:47,008
I think he's in shock.

521
00:46:47,087 --> 00:46:49,783
He must have had a seizure,
hit his head or something.

522
00:47:52,352 --> 00:47:54,149
What do you want blood tests for?

523
00:47:55,422 --> 00:47:56,480
What does he say?

524
00:47:56,557 --> 00:47:58,684
"Buccal smear, blood for a karyotype...

525
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:00,920
"...also pictures for the Goodman
and Sarich lab.

526
00:48:00,994 --> 00:48:03,554
"Picture of my neck. Now, before I...

527
00:48:04,231 --> 00:48:05,255
"...reconstitute."

528
00:48:05,332 --> 00:48:06,458
Before he what?

529
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:08,867
Before he reconstitutes.

530
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:12,729
Then take his damn blood,
and maybe he'll let me have a look at him.

531
00:48:16,577 --> 00:48:18,943
Do you mind if I examine your neck
for a minute?

532
00:48:20,514 --> 00:48:21,446
Any masses?

533
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:29,415
Stop talking shit!

534
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,980
Are you trying to say
your dumb hallucination has externalized?

535
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:33,287
What did he write?

536
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,157
"Not common aphasia.

537
00:48:35,228 --> 00:48:38,755
"Time-space,
fallout from the hallucination."

538
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,925
You are a fucking flake, Jessup.

539
00:48:41,034 --> 00:48:42,797
Get dressed. I'm taking you
to the Brigham...

540
00:48:42,869 --> 00:48:44,700
...and do a complete workup on you.

541
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,703
You are a very sick dude,
you dumb son of a bitch.

542
00:48:49,776 --> 00:48:51,744
I'll look down your throat,
do some skull films...

543
00:48:51,812 --> 00:48:54,838
...get a CAT scan, maybe even
an arteriogram, and I'd like...

544
00:48:54,915 --> 00:48:57,440
...an unbiased eye
to look at those EEG tracings.

545
00:48:58,919 --> 00:49:00,250
What does he say?

546
00:49:00,621 --> 00:49:01,383
"X-ray! "

547
00:49:02,155 --> 00:49:05,420
All right, finish up with him
and let's get him over to X-ray.

548
00:49:05,826 --> 00:49:07,191
Be right back.

549
00:49:36,123 --> 00:49:37,818
is it possible it's purely mechanical?

550
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:40,792
Well, if it isn't neurological,
it's got to be mechanical.

551
00:49:41,194 --> 00:49:45,358
I'd like some plain films of this guy's neck.
A PA, a lateral and oblique.

552
00:49:45,432 --> 00:49:46,797
I'm backed up to my ass!

553
00:49:46,867 --> 00:49:49,165
Just take the damn pictures!
This is an emergency!

554
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,154
Might be a TIA.

555
00:50:11,058 --> 00:50:13,288
I guess we'd better not tell Eddie he had...

556
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:17,762
...blood all over his face when he came
out of the tank. He'll claim it was...

557
00:50:18,899 --> 00:50:21,766
...goat's blood from that goat
he was eating in his hallucination.

558
00:50:21,835 --> 00:50:24,303
You know, you're really getting
as weird as he is!

559
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:26,202
What do you think happened?

560
00:50:27,307 --> 00:50:30,299
He's not the type for hysterical conversion,
so I'm thinking seizure.

561
00:50:30,377 --> 00:50:34,370
He came out of that tank in a fugue state
and had blood all over his face.

562
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,678
He must have had a seizure
while in the tank...

563
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:39,947
...bit his lip while convulsing
and is postictally aphasic.

564
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,956
I thought maybe he had a vascular insult,
a stroke, a flipped embolus...

565
00:50:45,092 --> 00:50:48,323
...but neurologically he's intact,
so I'm thinking seizure now.

566
00:51:00,774 --> 00:51:03,299
Now you just take it easy.

567
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:05,901
None of us are so terrific at reading X-rays.

568
00:51:06,213 --> 00:51:07,373
What are you looking for?

569
00:51:07,447 --> 00:51:10,473
Just put these in an envelope.
Who's reading tonight in Radiology?

570
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:11,915
Dr. Wissenschaft.

571
00:51:14,688 --> 00:51:16,679
I want someone reliable to look at them.

572
00:51:16,757 --> 00:51:18,725
I'd rather not have everyone
in the Brigham on this.

573
00:51:18,792 --> 00:51:21,192
It's bad enough we've got
this nosy X-ray technician.

574
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:22,421
Are you all right?

575
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,465
I'm fine. I tried to indicate
this was just a transient thing.

576
00:51:25,532 --> 00:51:27,932
A transient ischemic attack,
that's all it was.

577
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,202
-He's got his voice back.
-It wasn't an ischemic attack!

578
00:51:31,404 --> 00:51:33,269
It wasn't a seizure.
You saw the X-rays, Mason.

579
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,605
There was something anterior to the larynx
that looked like a laryngeal sac.

580
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,236
That's strictly simian.
I obviously regressed...

581
00:51:39,746 --> 00:51:42,180
...to some quasi-simian creature.

582
00:51:47,788 --> 00:51:49,688
I'll show these to someone
who can read them right.

583
00:51:49,756 --> 00:51:51,849
You're reading them wrong. That's all...

584
00:51:51,925 --> 00:51:53,051
...because no one is going to tell me...

585
00:51:53,126 --> 00:51:55,959
...you de-differentiated
your goddamn genetic structure...

586
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,520
...for four goddamn hours
and then reconstituted!

587
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:01,863
I'm a professor of endocrinology
at the Harvard Medical School!

588
00:52:01,935 --> 00:52:04,665
I'm an attending physician
at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital!

589
00:52:04,738 --> 00:52:06,035
I'm a contributing editor...

590
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:08,040
...to the American Journal
of Endocrinology!

591
00:52:08,108 --> 00:52:12,169
And I'm a fellow and vice-president of the
Eastern Association of Endocrinologists!

592
00:52:12,245 --> 00:52:14,213
And president of the Journal Club!

593
00:52:14,748 --> 00:52:16,375
And I'm not going to listen
to any more of...

594
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:21,250
...your cabalistic, quantum,
friggin', dumb, limbo mumbo jumbo!

595
00:52:21,655 --> 00:52:23,885
I'm going to show these to a radiologist!

596
00:52:35,535 --> 00:52:36,524
Do me a favor.

597
00:52:36,603 --> 00:52:39,037
Conclusion, bilateral aspiration pneumonia.

598
00:52:39,372 --> 00:52:42,830
-Do me a favor and take a look at these.
-What's the story in this case?

599
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:48,074
A 35-year-old white man, acute onset
of aphasia, no history of trauma.

600
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,212
What are you looking for?

601
00:52:50,283 --> 00:52:53,343
It looks to me like the architecture is
somewhat abnormal.

602
00:52:56,056 --> 00:52:57,148
Somewhat?

603
00:52:58,558 --> 00:53:00,253
This guy is a fucking gorilla!

604
00:54:09,896 --> 00:54:11,420
Are you okay, Dr. Jessup?

605
00:54:11,598 --> 00:54:12,690
Yes.

606
00:55:43,023 --> 00:55:44,786
Are you all right, Dr. Jessup?

607
00:55:51,498 --> 00:55:52,556
I'm fine.

608
00:56:02,242 --> 00:56:03,971
I just want to make a few notes.

609
00:56:42,215 --> 00:56:44,115
My God, you look so marvelous!

610
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,876
How have you been, Eddie?

611
00:56:47,087 --> 00:56:48,384
Just fine. You?

612
00:56:48,788 --> 00:56:49,812
Fine.

613
00:56:50,757 --> 00:56:51,815
Look, there's Daddy.

614
00:56:51,891 --> 00:56:54,223
Are you going to drive us
to our new house?

615
00:56:54,928 --> 00:56:56,725
You bet. Depending how nice you are...

616
00:56:56,796 --> 00:56:59,264
...maybe we'll take you
to a Chinese restaurant.

617
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:04,633
Don't let anybody tell you
baboons aren't occasionally carnivorous.

618
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,165
I observed instances of predation...

619
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,304
...which involved the unmistakable
behavior of hunters.

620
00:57:10,376 --> 00:57:13,311
A pair of baboons killed
the Thomson's gazelle and ate it.

621
00:57:13,379 --> 00:57:15,404
There was even
a rudimentary communication...

622
00:57:15,482 --> 00:57:17,109
...between the two baboons...

623
00:57:18,218 --> 00:57:19,446
...so I've become...

624
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,613
...fascinated with the work being done
on nonverbal communications with apes.

625
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,954
I've been corresponding with the Gardners
at the University of Nevada.

626
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:29,153
i may just go out and spend
a couple of weeks there this summer.

627
00:57:29,329 --> 00:57:32,025
I've got nothing else to do
except write up my report.

628
00:57:32,098 --> 00:57:34,828
I don't suppose you recorded
any of those baboon sounds?

629
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,067
Of course I did. Why?

630
00:57:37,137 --> 00:57:38,900
I'd like very much to hear them.

631
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,194
Of course.

632
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:43,807
Mrs. Tally said she'll be here
tomorrow morning at 10:30...

633
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,742
...to help you put everything away.

634
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:49,610
She wanted to know if you wanted her
to come back to work steady.

635
00:57:50,116 --> 00:57:51,845
i got a letter from ason
about a week ago...

636
00:57:51,918 --> 00:57:53,783
...just before we left Nairobi.

637
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:00,623
He says you've been working
with a very complex drug...

638
00:58:00,693 --> 00:58:02,684
...which you brought back from Mexico.

639
00:58:03,296 --> 00:58:06,424
It hasn't been thoroughly tested yet
and is dangerous as hell.

640
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,096
What else did Mason write you?

641
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:14,906
That over the past year you've taken
about two grams of that drug yourself...

642
00:58:15,175 --> 00:58:19,271
...and you had a very unusual instance of
genetic regression about three months ago.

643
00:58:19,946 --> 00:58:22,278
You may have leukemia or lymphoma.

644
00:58:24,284 --> 00:58:26,844
He's been trying to get you
to go for a complete workup...

645
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,683
...but you've refused to go.

646
00:58:29,189 --> 00:58:31,521
He's worried stiff that you're cracking up.

647
00:58:32,058 --> 00:58:34,322
He thinks you're behaving very strangely...

648
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:38,056
...and he begged me to talk to you
about this when I got back.

649
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:42,128
Mason is pathologically incapable
of keeping his mouth shut about anything.

650
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:45,404
-He's a stupid, starched, doctrinaire idiot!
-Mason is a first-rate doctor!

651
00:58:45,471 --> 00:58:47,268
It's not leukemia!

652
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,706
Or any other kind of cancer!

653
00:58:52,478 --> 00:58:55,743
I've let him do a liver-spleen scan on me
and a CAT scan.

654
00:58:55,815 --> 00:58:57,908
I have been probed, scoped and palpated!

655
00:58:57,984 --> 00:59:01,181
He's had a mirror down my throat
or up my ass for the last three months...

656
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,279
...and there is no evidence,
no suggestion whatsoever of cancer!

657
00:59:04,357 --> 00:59:05,949
What else did Mason write you?

658
00:59:08,528 --> 00:59:10,621
Which of these has
the baboon vocalizations on them?

659
00:59:10,697 --> 00:59:12,528
-I'd like to hear them.
-Why?

660
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:15,193
Did he write you that during
the regression...

661
00:59:15,268 --> 00:59:17,293
...I had an aphasic experience
for about four hours?

662
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:20,339
The only sounds I could get out were
clicks and grunts.

663
00:59:20,406 --> 00:59:22,431
They sound like the baboon vocalizations
on your tapes.

664
00:59:22,508 --> 00:59:24,976
Mason said you took blood tests
and the lab report showed...

665
00:59:25,044 --> 00:59:27,569
...some characteristics
of simian blood group systems.

666
00:59:27,747 --> 00:59:29,374
They also picked up antigens
specific to man.

667
00:59:29,449 --> 00:59:30,473
I'd like to see that data.

668
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:34,452
The thing to do is for me to get back
to that isolation tank and try it again!

669
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,887
Let's see if it happens again!
None of us really believes it happened.

670
00:59:37,957 --> 00:59:41,484
After three months, I'm beginning
to wonder if it ever happened myself.

671
00:59:41,561 --> 00:59:44,553
They won't go back to the tank.
Mason's taken over the project.

672
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:47,395
He's got Arthur up in his lab every day
fractionating rats' brains!

673
00:59:47,467 --> 00:59:51,233
What the hell am I supposed to do
while they're fractionating rats' brains?

674
00:59:55,975 --> 00:59:58,102
Everybody thinks your father's going nuts.

675
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,304
Mommy, when are we going to eat?

676
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,215
Run along now and play with Grace.

677
01:00:05,285 --> 01:00:09,278
I am convinced that the regression was
triggered by an act of consciousness.

678
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:12,415
When I was in the tank,
I entered another consciousness!

679
01:00:12,592 --> 01:00:15,425
I became another self,
a more primitive self...

680
01:00:15,495 --> 01:00:17,588
...and the drug, in some way...

681
01:00:18,431 --> 01:00:21,696
...triggered the externalization
of that other, more primitive self.

682
01:00:23,069 --> 01:00:24,627
At least look at my data!

683
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,535
Of course. Would tomorrow afternoon be--

684
01:00:26,606 --> 01:00:29,598
Don't patronize me!
It's just possible I'm not mad, you know!

685
01:00:29,676 --> 01:00:31,769
I'm asking you to make
a small quantum jump with me...

686
01:00:31,844 --> 01:00:33,971
...to accept one deviant concept...

687
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,647
...that our other states of consciousness
are as real as our waking state...

688
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,241
...and that reality can be externalized!

689
01:00:39,319 --> 01:00:40,308
You're screaming.

690
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,876
I get this patronizing shit...

691
01:00:41,954 --> 01:00:44,616
...from Arthur and Mason for three months
and I'm sick of it!

692
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:48,525
We've got millions of years stored away
in that computer bank we call our minds!

693
01:00:48,594 --> 01:00:52,121
We have got trillions of dormant genes
in us, our whole evolutionary past.

694
01:00:52,198 --> 01:00:54,029
Perhaps I've tapped into that!

695
01:00:54,634 --> 01:00:57,660
I want to get back into that tank
and repeat the experiment.

696
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:01,935
The most elementary laboratory behavior!
Repeat the experiment. Confirm it!

697
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,673
I would like other responsible scientists
with me when I do it!

698
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:08,270
I would like a little consensual validation
on this.

699
01:01:08,948 --> 01:01:12,281
We may have demonstrated
a whole new force in nature!

700
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:16,653
For God's sake, don't you agree
it merits further investigation?

701
01:01:16,723 --> 01:01:18,281
I have the tapes, notes and everything.

702
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:21,725
What time would you like to come
and look at the stuff tomorrow?

703
01:01:22,495 --> 01:01:23,792
2:00, 2:30.

704
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,992
I just want to get the girls.
I'll be right back.

705
01:02:08,408 --> 01:02:11,002
-i'll get it, i'll get it.
-No, no, i will.

706
01:02:12,378 --> 01:02:14,778
It's 8:30, so get washed
and changed right now...

707
01:02:14,847 --> 01:02:17,611
...and I want no trouble
from either of you tonight.

708
01:02:17,683 --> 01:02:18,775
Hello?

709
01:02:19,285 --> 01:02:21,344
Oh, Mason. Thank you for calling.

710
01:02:21,921 --> 01:02:23,684
I assume you've spoken to Arthur.

711
01:02:24,524 --> 01:02:27,118
No, no, I just got back
from dinner with the kids.

712
01:02:27,527 --> 01:02:30,257
Well, I just don't know what to say.

713
01:02:30,396 --> 01:02:33,490
I think you're absolutely right.
He's on the verge of a breakdown.

714
01:02:33,566 --> 01:02:37,195
He was here all afternoon and carried on
like a madman and then just disappeared.

715
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:40,706
Ordinarily I wouldn't be this panicky,
but I just am very worried.

716
01:04:51,938 --> 01:04:54,964
-What's the trouble?
-There's an animal loose in the basement!

717
01:04:55,374 --> 01:04:56,705
What kind of animal?

718
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,273
Monkey, I think!

719
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:23,968
Charlie! Charlie Thomas!

720
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:26,666
Where are you?

721
01:05:28,975 --> 01:05:31,443
We've got an animal loose
in the B-building basement.

722
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:34,001
I'm heading to the north corridor
leading to the boiler room...

723
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,672
...so you guys come down the other way.

724
01:05:35,748 --> 01:05:38,308
Now, watch your step.
He's a pretty good-sized ape.

725
01:05:38,451 --> 01:05:41,648
Call the animal rooms and....
What the hell is he doing down here?

726
01:06:10,783 --> 01:06:12,546
He must be in here somewhere.

727
01:06:14,987 --> 01:06:16,750
I'm gonna take a look up here.

728
01:08:08,067 --> 01:08:09,830
Get out of here!

729
01:13:55,914 --> 01:13:57,905
What were you doing in the tank room?

730
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:03,015
I remember large fragments
of what happened, but not all of it.

731
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:08,025
You'll have to be patient with me.

732
01:14:09,228 --> 01:14:12,391
I've had Mason looking all over Boston
for you all night.

733
01:14:13,565 --> 01:14:15,055
It's okay. I'm all right.

734
01:14:24,643 --> 01:14:28,010
I suppose getting a call at 2:30
in the morning from the police...

735
01:14:29,314 --> 01:14:31,976
...to the effect your husband has been
found sleeping naked...

736
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,746
...in the city zoo might have caused you
some concern.

737
01:14:34,953 --> 01:14:36,113
I think you could say that.

738
01:14:36,188 --> 01:14:39,680
And Mason writing you this whole time
that I'm having a nervous breakdown...

739
01:14:39,758 --> 01:14:42,454
...and you figured
I finally flipped out altogether.

740
01:14:44,963 --> 01:14:49,024
I'm sorry, Emily. Forgive me. I know
what a harrowing day I've caused you.

741
01:14:49,101 --> 01:14:51,160
I suppose you've been sitting here
all this time...

742
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:53,932
...trying to figure out
how to get me to a psychiatrist.

743
01:14:54,006 --> 01:14:55,496
As a matter of fact, I have.

744
01:14:55,674 --> 01:14:58,575
I don't know how you've put up with me
all these years.

745
01:15:01,046 --> 01:15:02,172
I loved you.

746
01:15:06,518 --> 01:15:10,215
Oh, my God, Emily, I don't know
how to tell you this. I really don't.

747
01:15:10,889 --> 01:15:12,823
The implications are staggering.

748
01:15:13,392 --> 01:15:15,622
Apparently I entered
a very primitive consciousness.

749
01:15:15,694 --> 01:15:18,527
All I can remember is what was
comprehensible to that consciousness.

750
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:22,158
I don't remember, at least not clearly,
how I got out of the tank room.

751
01:15:23,468 --> 01:15:25,527
The first thing I remember are the dogs.

752
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:28,835
I followed a pack of wild dogs to the zoo.
That's how I got there.

753
01:15:31,009 --> 01:15:34,445
In the zoo, I hunted down,
killed and ate a small sheep.

754
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:41,013
I was utterly primal.
I consisted of nothing more...

755
01:15:41,086 --> 01:15:44,112
...than the will to survive,
to live through the night...

756
01:15:44,556 --> 01:15:45,955
...to eat...

757
01:15:47,059 --> 01:15:48,321
...to drink...

758
01:15:51,196 --> 01:15:52,356
...to sleep.

759
01:15:56,201 --> 01:15:58,965
It was the most supremely
satisfying time of my life.

760
01:16:02,941 --> 01:16:04,636
I may have killed a man tonight.

761
01:16:06,612 --> 01:16:07,874
I remember...

762
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:11,540
...beating on a....

763
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:22,953
You don't know the trouble I had
getting these clothes.

764
01:16:23,028 --> 01:16:25,394
I had to go down to the security office.

765
01:16:27,532 --> 01:16:30,160
They want you to call
the security office right now.

766
01:16:30,302 --> 01:16:33,135
There was some kind of ape loose
in your isolation tank room tonight.

767
01:16:33,205 --> 01:16:36,902
Do you know anything about that?
This ape almost killed a security guard.

768
01:16:37,576 --> 01:16:40,807
You didn't bring some ape
down to that tank room tonight, did you?

769
01:16:45,384 --> 01:16:48,581
Your watch and stuff are
in your jacket pocket. Are you all right?

770
01:16:49,655 --> 01:16:50,883
Is he all right?

771
01:16:51,256 --> 01:16:53,281
Tell Mason what you've been telling me.

772
01:16:53,425 --> 01:16:55,620
I want to hear Mason's views on all this.

773
01:16:57,129 --> 01:16:59,393
I think Mason's views will be predictable.

774
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:04,232
y God! There it is...

775
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:10,169
...a proto-human. The first and
the original truly human form.

776
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:14,944
Tiny. Perhaps four feet high.
Completely furred.

777
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:19,077
Chimp-like, but erect.
No knuckle walking. Shorter arms.

778
01:17:19,151 --> 01:17:23,850
He's moving along so gracefully.
There's two, three of them.

779
01:17:25,257 --> 01:17:26,884
Bipedal, tiny....

780
01:17:35,133 --> 01:17:37,533
i'm killing....

781
01:17:37,602 --> 01:17:39,570
i'm killing something, a goat.

782
01:17:40,105 --> 01:17:41,800
i'm killing...

783
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:44,870
...i'm eating hot flesh.

784
01:17:45,143 --> 01:17:46,974
i'm eating the blood of a goat.

785
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:52,311
Are you okay?

786
01:17:53,218 --> 01:17:54,207
Beautiful.

787
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:55,445
Beautiful.

788
01:17:55,887 --> 01:17:58,117
it sounded like he was having
a bad trip to me.

789
01:17:58,190 --> 01:18:00,750
Some of these tank trips can get
pretty creepy.

790
01:18:03,528 --> 01:18:05,052
What the hell was that?

791
01:19:00,118 --> 01:19:01,779
Did I wake you? It's Emily.

792
01:19:02,888 --> 01:19:05,823
Eddie, I'm in a kind of wild panic.
I need to talk to you.

793
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:20,561
I don't know how even
to put this into words...

794
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:22,937
...but I'm beginning to think
what happened to you was...

795
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,999
...not just a hallucinatory experience.

796
01:19:25,076 --> 01:19:29,012
I've got this gut feeling that something
phenomenological did actually happen...

797
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,708
...that there was some kind
of genetic transformation.

798
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:35,317
I don't know why I think this is
in defiance of all rationality, but I do...

799
01:19:35,387 --> 01:19:38,845
...and now that I do, I'm terrified.
I mean really terrified. Petrified.

800
01:19:38,924 --> 01:19:40,016
So am I.

801
01:19:40,091 --> 01:19:42,252
I don't want you doing
this experiment again next week.

802
01:19:42,327 --> 01:19:43,794
I have to find out if it actually happened.

803
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,489
I'm asking you to put the experiment off...

804
01:19:45,564 --> 01:19:47,532
...till we understand it more
to minimize the risk.

805
01:19:47,599 --> 01:19:50,295
You can't. You have to work back
from the event itself.

806
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:52,996
But you may be causing yourself
irreversible genetic damage!

807
01:19:53,071 --> 01:19:54,265
We're not dealing with genetics!

808
01:19:54,339 --> 01:19:56,534
We're beyond mass and matter here,
beyond even energy.

809
01:19:56,608 --> 01:19:58,667
What we're back to is the first thought.

810
01:20:00,078 --> 01:20:01,875
I'm trying to tell you I love you.

811
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:04,276
I know that.

812
01:20:05,584 --> 01:20:09,281
And I'm trying to tell you,
this is an all-bets-are-off sort of thing.

813
01:20:09,421 --> 01:20:12,913
We may be opening a black box that may
scrap our whole picture of space-time.

814
01:20:12,991 --> 01:20:15,152
We might even have a link
to another universe.

815
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:18,492
For God's sake, you're a scientist.
You must know how I feel.

816
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:23,099
Yes, I know how you feel.

817
01:20:26,204 --> 01:20:28,866
It's very late.
Would you like to stay here tonight?

818
01:20:31,476 --> 01:20:34,707
I could do with a little love
and a little reassurance right now.

819
01:20:36,014 --> 01:20:37,413
You'll stay, won't you?

820
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:19,119
If I come out of that tank anthropoid,
I'll be in a very primitive state...

821
01:21:19,190 --> 01:21:22,956
...and impossible to relate to,
so sedate me while I'm still in the tank...

822
01:21:23,028 --> 01:21:26,054
...otherwise you'll have to chase me around
and subdue me.

823
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:30,362
You come out of that tank
looking like an ape...

824
01:21:30,435 --> 01:21:33,199
...I'm going over to Mass. Mental
and commit myself.

825
01:21:34,339 --> 01:21:36,807
If it happens, we'll bring him down
with a big bolus of Amytal.

826
01:21:36,875 --> 01:21:40,208
What do you mean if it happens?
Everybody keeps saying if it happens!

827
01:21:40,412 --> 01:21:44,439
Do you think something is gonna happen?
Because if you do, I'd like to know.

828
01:21:46,051 --> 01:21:48,076
I'm sorry. I'm just nervous as hell.

829
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:49,612
Listen, so am I.

830
01:22:53,585 --> 01:22:54,711
Anything happen?

831
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,379
I just checked him 10 minutes ago.

832
01:22:58,523 --> 01:23:00,252
Did you order chicken or turkey?

833
01:23:00,325 --> 01:23:02,020
I hope chicken is all right.

834
01:23:02,093 --> 01:23:04,425
I've got nearly 1 1 :00.
That's more than two hours now.

835
01:23:04,496 --> 01:23:06,259
I think we should stop this.

836
01:23:07,098 --> 01:23:08,656
Frankly, I'm really frightened!

837
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:10,758
We could be screwing up
his whole genetic structure!

838
01:23:10,835 --> 01:23:12,496
Now how do we stop this?

839
01:23:12,604 --> 01:23:14,765
-Can you bring him down?
-He's gonna be sore as hell.

840
01:23:14,839 --> 01:23:16,204
We should never have let him do it!

841
01:23:16,274 --> 01:23:18,572
I don't know how we let him
talk us into this.

842
01:23:18,643 --> 01:23:20,702
We were humoring him,
but we know he's not crazy...

843
01:23:20,779 --> 01:23:22,269
...and we all know, deep in our hearts...

844
01:23:22,347 --> 01:23:25,282
...he may be onto something
beyond our own comprehension!

845
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:28,217
Now, because I believe him,
I want this thing stopped!

846
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:17,219
His signs are all good.

847
01:31:17,288 --> 01:31:19,256
He'll sleep a day or two,
come out a bit stuporous.

848
01:31:19,323 --> 01:31:21,314
He's got a whopping load of drugs in him.

849
01:31:21,392 --> 01:31:24,088
It's not uncommon
for a psychedelic experience like this...

850
01:31:24,162 --> 01:31:25,186
...to whack you out.

851
01:31:25,263 --> 01:31:27,595
You'd hardly call this
just a psychedelic experience.

852
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:29,927
His heart is good. His pressure is good.

853
01:31:30,001 --> 01:31:32,265
I'm more worried about you
than I am about him.

854
01:31:32,336 --> 01:31:33,394
I'm all right.

855
01:31:41,612 --> 01:31:44,638
Of all the goddamn men in this whole
world, why do I have to love this one?

856
01:31:44,715 --> 01:31:46,182
I can't get him out of me.

857
01:31:46,884 --> 01:31:49,682
Do you know how many men
I tried to fall in love with this past year?

858
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:53,019
No matter who I'm in bed with, I have
to imagine it's him or nothing happens.

859
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:55,081
No matter who I'm eating with
or walking with...

860
01:31:55,159 --> 01:31:57,684
...there's always this pain
because it isn't him.

861
01:31:58,396 --> 01:32:00,091
I'm possessed by him.

862
01:32:03,901 --> 01:32:05,368
Oh, it's crazy!

863
01:32:07,038 --> 01:32:09,097
I think that's the way it's supposed to be.

864
01:32:09,173 --> 01:32:10,401
But he doesn't give a damn about me!

865
01:32:10,474 --> 01:32:13,409
You're the only thing he cares about
outside of his work.

866
01:32:15,346 --> 01:32:18,747
I was never real to him. Nothing in
the human condition was ever real to him.

867
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,078
He's a truth lover.

868
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:24,486
Reality to Eddie is only that
which is changeless, immutably constant.

869
01:32:25,523 --> 01:32:28,515
What happened to Eddie tonight,
that was Eddie's idea of love.

870
01:32:30,528 --> 01:32:32,189
That's consummation.

871
01:32:33,364 --> 01:32:35,855
He finally got it off with God.

872
01:32:35,933 --> 01:32:40,302
He finally embraced the Absolute,
was finally ravished by Truth...

873
01:32:40,371 --> 01:32:42,464
...and it goddamned near destroyed him!

874
01:32:44,775 --> 01:32:47,005
He never loved me.
You knew him as well as I did.

875
01:32:47,078 --> 01:32:50,138
We were all bits
of transitory matter to him.

876
01:32:52,783 --> 01:32:56,275
All right, now, you're going into shock.
I'm going to get you something.

877
01:33:10,968 --> 01:33:14,233
We reached a point tonight
where physical science just breaks down.

878
01:33:14,305 --> 01:33:15,795
We're in blue skies!

879
01:33:16,107 --> 01:33:18,701
Tonight was history,
and what are we going to do about it?

880
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:21,078
I'm going to do nothing about it!

881
01:33:21,379 --> 01:33:22,937
Tonight scared the hell out of me!

882
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:24,641
That tank just blew up!

883
01:33:24,982 --> 01:33:28,509
Whatever happened inside that tank
released a hell of a lot of energy.

884
01:33:29,353 --> 01:33:33,153
For God's sake, let's drop this goddamn
thing. I don't want to talk about it.

885
01:33:33,224 --> 01:33:36,125
I can't help it!
You may want to go to sleep...

886
01:33:36,227 --> 01:33:39,025
...but the way I feel
I don't expect to go to sleep for a year!

887
01:33:39,096 --> 01:33:41,064
I'm on fucking fire!

888
01:33:41,666 --> 01:33:45,625
I am in there mopping up the goddamned
tank room and I would like to know why!

889
01:33:46,103 --> 01:33:48,128
Do you believe in supernatural agencies?

890
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:49,536
No, sir, I do not!

891
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:53,404
Then what we saw tonight was
a physical phenomenon...

892
01:33:53,477 --> 01:33:56,207
...an inexplicable physical phenomenon!

893
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:59,044
If it's phenomenological,
then it's explicable. I have to know why.

894
01:33:59,116 --> 01:33:59,980
Let me talk!

895
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:01,484
I've been mopping that tank room...

896
01:34:01,552 --> 01:34:04,180
...for the last three hours
and I've had it! Leave me alone!

897
01:34:04,255 --> 01:34:07,452
I would like to tell you
what I would like to do!

898
01:34:07,658 --> 01:34:10,149
We have got to repeat this
with other human subjects!

899
01:34:10,227 --> 01:34:11,694
We need a selective sample!

900
01:34:11,762 --> 01:34:14,788
We will put up a notice
in the Student Union for volunteers!

901
01:34:14,999 --> 01:34:17,968
And get five or six subjects
and go back to square one with them...

902
01:34:18,035 --> 01:34:19,662
...and step up the doses of the drug...

903
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:22,934
...in a graduated fashion
and check them against Eddie's values!

904
01:34:23,541 --> 01:34:26,635
We could even get a grant,
for Christ's sake!

905
01:34:29,547 --> 01:34:33,381
And here you are, willing to use an
untested drug on innocent human beings!

906
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:35,048
Please stop shouting!

907
01:34:44,495 --> 01:34:45,553
How are you?

908
01:34:47,031 --> 01:34:48,965
Would you like to go back to sleep?

909
01:34:50,968 --> 01:34:52,094
Yes.

910
01:34:53,404 --> 01:34:56,339
Would you mind if Mason had
a quick look at you first?

911
01:34:58,175 --> 01:34:59,369
Good idea.

912
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,178
Maybe you ought to have
a quick look at him.

913
01:36:08,446 --> 01:36:10,038
Oh, I hope it isn't the kids.

914
01:36:11,649 --> 01:36:12,707
Hello?

915
01:36:16,554 --> 01:36:18,681
Everything's fine, Arthur. He's fine.

916
01:36:19,523 --> 01:36:21,252
It's Arthur. Are you fine?

917
01:36:23,327 --> 01:36:26,353
I'll call you back when I'm more awake.
Everything is fine.

918
01:36:31,602 --> 01:36:33,331
God, I wonder what time it is.

919
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:36,505
I should call the kids.

920
01:36:38,242 --> 01:36:40,540
I can't tell you
how much you mean to me...

921
01:36:41,011 --> 01:36:44,503
...how much I need you and the kids.
I just wanted you to know that.

922
01:36:44,782 --> 01:36:48,013
You saved me. You redeemed me
from the pit. I was in it, Emily.

923
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:51,415
I was in that ultimate moment of terror...

924
01:36:51,489 --> 01:36:53,457
...that is the beginning of life.

925
01:36:53,691 --> 01:36:54,885
It is nothing.

926
01:36:56,293 --> 01:36:58,261
Simple, hideous nothing.

927
01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:03,488
The final truth of all things is
that there is no final Truth.

928
01:37:05,369 --> 01:37:08,998
Truth is what's transitory.
It's human life that is real.

929
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:10,199
I don't want to frighten you...

930
01:37:10,274 --> 01:37:13,107
...but what I'm trying to tell you is
that moment of terror...

931
01:37:13,177 --> 01:37:16,578
...is a real and living horror,
living and growing within me now...

932
01:37:17,681 --> 01:37:20,741
...and the only thing that keeps it
from devouring me is you.

933
01:37:20,985 --> 01:37:22,953
Why don't you just come back to us?

934
01:37:25,689 --> 01:37:29,216
It's too late.
I don't think I can get out of it anymore.

935
01:37:30,294 --> 01:37:32,785
I can't live with it. The pain is too great.

936
01:37:41,405 --> 01:37:42,565
Defy it, Eddie!

937
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:45,074
You made it real. You can make it unreal!

938
01:37:45,543 --> 01:37:46,976
If you love me, Eddie...

939
01:37:47,211 --> 01:37:48,200
...if you love me!

940
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:50,008
Eddie! Defy it!

941
01:39:36,654 --> 01:39:37,916
I love you, Emily.
