1
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,692
Reverse Egyptian suplex!

2
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:31,829
Reverse Egyptian suplex!

3
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,198
He's going for the pin!

4
00:00:33,235 --> 00:00:34,101
<b>Subrip: Pix
-One!</b>

5
00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:34,835
<b>Subrip: Pix
-Two!</b>

6
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:36,005
<b>Subrip: Pix
-Three!</b>

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,108
<b>THE BET
-And it's all over!</b>

8
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:40,148
<b>THE BET
-What an absolute war that was!</b>

9
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:41,836
<b>THE BET
-Okay wrestling fans,</b>

10
00:00:41,837 --> 00:00:43,787
<b>THE BET
-it's time for the main event.</b>

11
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:46,828
After years of heartbreak,
unfulfilled dreams and

12
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:50,000
shattered confidence, this
young man will finally

13
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:53,274
have one last shot
at the world title.

14
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:54,911
Does he have any chance?

15
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:57,719
If you ask this announcer,
he's fucked.

16
00:00:57,755 --> 00:01:00,557
Dude, thanks for bogarting
all these sweet wrestling

17
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,126
DVDs from work.

18
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,695
Yeah dude.

19
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:04,932
I'd rather you have them
than see them getting

20
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:06,936
thrown out when
the store closes.

21
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:11,880
Keep an
eye on dad tonight.

22
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:14,317
He hasn't been the same since
we moved into the garage.

23
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:15,254
No problem.

24
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,058
Good luck on your date.

25
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:19,763
Maybe she'll let you
sniff her butthole.

26
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,634
It's just dinner, dude.

27
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:27,945
Hey Mr. B, what you
working on over there?

28
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:31,722
Completing the
perfect woman.

29
00:01:32,424 --> 00:01:35,094
I look forward
to meeting her.

30
00:01:37,234 --> 00:01:39,837
I already got started,
I hope you don't mind.

31
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:43,277
Just need to get my
drink on tonight.

32
00:01:43,314 --> 00:01:47,686
Well I get getting your
drink on this evening.

33
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:50,192
This is a really beautiful
place you picked.

34
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:52,162
I am starving. I mean
I could eat a horse.

35
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:52,963
That's funny.

36
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:55,402
Let's see do they have horse,
I'm checking.

37
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,777
No, no! They have 30
dollar soup though.

38
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:07,061
So, I feel like I've
been totally talking

39
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:08,396
your face off about me.

40
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:09,231
No.

41
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:12,873
Tell me more about you.

42
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:15,812
I...
work at a video store.

43
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,350
People still rent movies?

44
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:19,050
Well, no actually.

45
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:20,888
That's kind of
the problem.

46
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:22,859
I dunno, I think it's kind of
sad that people don't go

47
00:02:22,895 --> 00:02:23,928
to video stores anymore.

48
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:25,932
It's kind of an Americana
kind of, sort of thing.

49
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:27,433
I dunno. Going...

50
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:28,302
Brandon?

51
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:29,307
No, I'm Denton.

52
00:02:29,342 --> 00:02:30,174
Shaniqua?

53
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:31,076
Danielle!

54
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:32,045
Holy shit, I don't care.

55
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:33,949
Come here, come here.

56
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:36,721
So good to see you!

57
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,825
-You look fucking amazing.
-Thank you.

58
00:02:38,864 --> 00:02:41,098
-Hey, Brandon, this is Denton.
-Denton!

59
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:42,767
On a date with
a real girl?

60
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:43,939
Good for you, buddy.

61
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:46,209
It's just kind of like a
blind date sort of thing.

62
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:47,745
It's going bad.

63
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:49,149
I'm right here.

64
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:50,217
I figured as much.

65
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,219
Hey, you know what, I made
some improvements to the

66
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:55,227
old choo-choo train, if
you want to, come.

67
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:57,197
For like a ride, you know.

68
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:58,867
Meet me in the parking lot.

69
00:02:58,903 --> 00:03:00,037
That a girl.

70
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:02,675
Okay so, thank you so much
this has been really great.

71
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,943
- Yeah.
- And yeah.

72
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,850
Good luck with the whole
video store job thingy.

73
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:08,186
-Thank you.
-Okay, bye!

74
00:03:08,223 --> 00:03:10,024
Hey, cancel my drink?

75
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,165
Later, Denton!

76
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,070
Whenever you're
ready, chief.

77
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,747
It's all over folks!

78
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:22,382
He fucked that one up!

79
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,227
That was awesome.

80
00:03:27,895 --> 00:03:29,061
Dad.

81
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,467
Come on, come on.

82
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,070
Let's go to bed?

83
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:37,247
Come on, let's go to bed.

84
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:44,895
So, how was the big date?

85
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:47,100
It was not good.

86
00:03:47,137 --> 00:03:50,174
It was not, in fact,
it was pretty terrible.

87
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,186
Well, life is a
series of miserable dates.

88
00:03:58,527 --> 00:03:59,927
Terrific.

89
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:03,133
Now Batting, Jackson Price.

90
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,037
I got one.

91
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:05,772
Kendra McNulty.

92
00:04:07,544 --> 00:04:08,911
Kendra McNulty.

93
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:14,123
She was fine and she
would've got that root.

94
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:16,495
That was a God damn ball!

95
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,199
Those fucks paid
off the ump again.

96
00:04:19,237 --> 00:04:20,336
Ed, stat me.

97
00:04:20,372 --> 00:04:24,109
Well according to this,
"Dyke Piazza," you're 0 and 4

98
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:25,947
for the entire day, so it
looks like all that money

99
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,317
you spent on glare
protection is really

100
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:28,386
working out for you.

101
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:29,956
Bullshit!

102
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:32,160
What the hell is this?

103
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:34,064
It's a list of all
the hottest girls

104
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:36,169
we went to school with.

105
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:37,172
Kendra McNulty?

106
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,174
Please.

107
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:40,277
You want to talk about
fine middle school puss?

108
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:42,113
Hayley Matthews.

109
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,418
Yeah.

110
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:46,323
Hayley Matthews, yo, that
was the first girl in our

111
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:47,557
grade to have sex, right?

112
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:49,261
Hell yeah. She sucked
off Danny Clarke

113
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:50,398
on the 8th grade
field trip.

114
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:52,302
No, that was
Mikey Milligan.

115
00:04:52,338 --> 00:04:53,971
How do you know?

116
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:56,142
'Cause I was sitting
in between them.

117
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,150
She leaned over your
dick to suck his?

118
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:01,320
Oof.

119
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:03,325
I cannot believe you
let her do a flyover.

120
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,495
Next time a girl
tries to do that?

121
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:07,032
Air pocket.
Bring her down.

122
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:08,502
If I could do it all over
again, I would have a

123
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,307
vault of vag to dive into.

124
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,044
They would call
me Scrooge McFuck.

125
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,480
I literally don't think
anyone would call you that.

126
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:16,285
A couple people might.

127
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:17,987
You guys talking
Duck Tales?

128
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:22,127
Wait, apologies for getting you
wet with a cartoon analogy.

129
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:23,565
But can you please
not interrupt serious

130
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:25,305
conversations about pussy?

131
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:26,438
Hey Denton, what
do you think?

132
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:27,942
You wanna send one of your
ladies out here so we can

133
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:29,144
end this and go home?

134
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,379
I got hot yoga!

135
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,016
I want him dead.

136
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:34,956
Wiggins, get up there and
smash the ball down that

137
00:05:34,992 --> 00:05:36,125
motherfucker's throat.

138
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:37,495
Will do, coach.

139
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:38,497
Here we go.

140
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:40,098
Do it, Ken Spiffy Junior.

141
00:05:40,136 --> 00:05:41,838
Two for two.

142
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,615
Good hustle, good hustle,
Wiggins.

143
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:47,480
Good hustle.

144
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:49,084
Dropping dimes, Brandon.

145
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:51,224
Now batting, Wiggins.

146
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:52,260
Come on dude, really?

147
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:53,928
You're gonna text
during the game?

148
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:55,397
It's called sexting
you fucking nerd.

149
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:56,668
Yeah?
Is it pre-paid?

150
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:59,408
No. It's unlimited
like your mom.

151
00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:02,045
-Strike!
-Shit!

152
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:04,084
Jackson, you
gotta chill dude.

153
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,086
Have you forgotten?

154
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:06,588
When old man Lucas shuts
down the video store,

155
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,024
our team goes with it.

156
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,195
Look at that old
fuck out there.

157
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,268
Rubbing our faces
in his shit.

158
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:14,504
Our faces right
in his shit!

159
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,507
Eddie, honey.

160
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,512
I just finished my work
out, but I'm going to go

161
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:18,480
pick up a six pack.

162
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:20,082
We're still watching the
game tonight, right?

163
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:20,950
Absolutely, baby.

164
00:06:20,987 --> 00:06:21,954
-Alright.
-Alright, see you tonight.

165
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,189
Love you!

166
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:26,663
I would totally
go big on your wife.

167
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,300
Strike three!

168
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:29,902
Goin' down swinging,
like your girlfriend

169
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:31,205
on my dick last night.

170
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,044
Joke's on you, I don't
have a girlfriend.

171
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:35,480
Horribly embarrassing.

172
00:06:35,517 --> 00:06:36,450
Bring it in.

173
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:37,686
You guys suck dick.

174
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:41,525
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you,
fuck you, madam, fuck you...

175
00:06:41,564 --> 00:06:43,331
You so want to bone her.

176
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:44,567
Always have.

177
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:46,103
Always will.

178
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,541
Hey.

179
00:06:48,577 --> 00:06:50,445
You checking out my
mom's ass, perverts?

180
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:52,184
-Yeah.
-No.

181
00:06:52,218 --> 00:06:53,451
I thought that was
your step mom's ass.

182
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:54,520
Fuck you, Jackson.

183
00:06:54,557 --> 00:06:55,322
You fucking Ewok.

184
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:56,692
By the way, I saw
your game today.

185
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:58,329
0 for 4, nice.

186
00:06:58,365 --> 00:06:59,598
What's this?

187
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:02,871
Hand that to me.

188
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:05,075
You're making a list of
all the girls you wish you

189
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:06,211
fucked in school.

190
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:07,913
That's hilarious, 'cause I
have a list of girls I did

191
00:07:07,951 --> 00:07:09,251
fuck in school.
Serge here's seen it.

192
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:10,252
It's a big fuckin' list!

193
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:12,991
Hey, Denton could fuck
every girl on that list.

194
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:14,426
Let the man speak.

195
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:15,930
So you think Denton could get
through this whole list?

196
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,170
Every name? Could you
do that, Denton?

197
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:20,206
I didn't say anything,
I... maybe her.

198
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:22,344
God, I smell a
bet coming on.

199
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,114
I wish any of you fuckers
had anything of value.

200
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:24,916
Anything.

201
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:27,221
I'd drain you for
every penny.

202
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:31,060
In the meantime, we've
got a train to catch.

203
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:32,565
Enjoy tickling each
others' pussies, ladies.

204
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:35,072
Pussy!

205
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:42,154
Woo woo!

206
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:49,866
This place is jumping.

207
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:51,504
How do you have
any movies left?

208
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,740
What's up guys,
how you doing?

209
00:07:52,778 --> 00:07:56,114
Good, we're just doing some
man stuff around the corner.

210
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:58,286
Figured we'd stop
by, say what's up.

211
00:07:58,322 --> 00:07:59,019
'Sup.

212
00:07:59,057 --> 00:08:01,225
We still on for
Taco Tuesdays?

213
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:02,694
God, yes, please.

214
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,033
Nice. Any chance we can
push that up a little bit?

215
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:06,603
I have a training
sesh at night.

216
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,204
A training "sesh?"

217
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:10,511
Yeah, it's short for session.

218
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:11,146
Okay.

219
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:12,615
Who you training tonight?

220
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:14,621
I haven't decided yet.

221
00:08:14,656 --> 00:08:15,688
Hi! Hey, how's it going.

222
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:16,524
How's it going?

223
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,129
Yeah.

224
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:20,463
Why don't you smell that.

225
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:23,771
Smell it.

226
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,110
What does that
smell like to you?

227
00:08:26,146 --> 00:08:27,445
Kind of like an envelope.

228
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:30,152
It smells like a
sweaty asshole.

229
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:32,155
Here, try this one.

230
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,332
Dude, all of your movies
smell like a fuckin' asshole.

231
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,605
-Smells like a butthole.
-Really, I...

232
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:42,110
Now my player smells
like a fuckin' asshole.

233
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,781
You guys sitting
on this shit?

234
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:48,258
Delivery for Lucas
Gourmet Condoms.

235
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:50,094
You know what,
actually that goes across

236
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,596
the street to the
company over there.

237
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:54,100
They're not getting stuff here
'til the end of the summer.

238
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:56,471
Those fuckers are getting
packages here already?

239
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:57,609
I don't give two shits.

240
00:08:57,644 --> 00:08:59,378
This is what it
says on the package,

241
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,014
this is where
I'm dropping it.

242
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:04,054
Hey, why don't you
smell this thing?

243
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,992
What does that
smell like to you?

244
00:09:07,197 --> 00:09:08,264
Smells like...

245
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,168
wet dirty assholes.

246
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,243
What the fuck are
you guys doing here?

247
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:20,521
Denton, what's up?

248
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,794
Hi, Br...

249
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,595
Denise.

250
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:26,200
That was close,
you almost had it.

251
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:28,471
Sorry, you guys are
actually already having

252
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:30,510
packages delivered
to the video store.

253
00:09:30,547 --> 00:09:31,110
Sorry.

254
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:32,279
Denise!

255
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:33,650
One second.

256
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:36,621
Okay, I'll
send him back.

257
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:37,658
Hey!

258
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:38,826
Yes?

259
00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:40,163
Mr. Lucas wants
to see you.

260
00:09:40,198 --> 00:09:41,298
He's in Brandon's office.

261
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,533
Okay, just right
around the corner.

262
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:44,772
H-how does
he know I'm here?

263
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:48,380
'Cause they're watching,
and you have your Taco

264
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,419
Tuesday with your friends
later at La Cabaña.

265
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:54,125
H-how did you know that?

266
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:58,234
Good luck with
the old man, okay?

267
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,269
It'll be fine.

268
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:05,815
Hey!

269
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:06,583
Denton!

270
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,653
What's up, man?

271
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:08,688
I meant to say
congratulations

272
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,224
on fucking Danielle.

273
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:11,193
That's awesome.

274
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,263
I didn't, I didn't.

275
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:13,431
I'm sorry, wait, wait.

276
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:14,265
That was me.

277
00:10:14,302 --> 00:10:15,369
I fucked her. Twice.

278
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:16,338
We filmed it, actually.

279
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:17,240
What was the
movie called?

280
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:19,610
"The Great
Train Blowjobbery."

281
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:21,581
Gimme all your cum, man!

282
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:23,921
Did Danielle know you
that you were filming her?

283
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,389
What are you,
fucking stupid?

284
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:27,327
Like we asked
permission to film her?

285
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:28,194
Train porno.

286
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:29,798
It's the world's
fastest growing fetish.

287
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:32,504
We're the Lucas and
Sergeberg of the genre.

288
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,278
"Shagheart Express,"
"Missionary: Possible,"

289
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:36,679
"Me Hard On The
Orient Express."

290
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:38,384
"Trains, Planes, and
Cock Is Your Meal."

291
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:39,451
Fucking classics, bro.

292
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:40,253
Amen, sister.

293
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,427
Tell him Mr. Lucas
said "fuck you!"

294
00:10:44,364 --> 00:10:45,764
Denton.

295
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:47,869
I'm glad you came by.

296
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:48,870
It's a big day, man.

297
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:52,244
After my groundbreaking
career in the flavored

298
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,384
jimmy biz, I'll be retiring
at the end of the summer.

299
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,859
So Brandon's you're new
point person in regards to

300
00:10:58,894 --> 00:10:59,927
the takeover.

301
00:10:59,964 --> 00:11:03,634
Now I want my product in
that bullshit video store

302
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:04,638
within ninety days.

303
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:05,872
Yes, sir.

304
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:08,478
We've started our move out and
we will be out on time.

305
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:09,682
You damn well better.

306
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:12,254
You know, you should've just
closed that shithole today.

307
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,525
I mean, what the hell have
you wasted your whole damn

308
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:16,429
life for in there?

309
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:19,570
Well it means
something to me, sir.

310
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:25,013
I can remember all of the
best times growing up

311
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:27,283
going to that video
store and...

312
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:28,921
I made all my best
friends there.

313
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:31,759
And I know people don't rent
at a video store anymore.

314
00:11:31,796 --> 00:11:38,775
I know that's kinda in the past,
but it's made me who I am.

315
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:39,910
A huge pussy.

316
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:40,912
Shit!

317
00:11:40,948 --> 00:11:42,048
Hit him with the low, dog.

318
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:50,031
Alright, alright. Son, you're
either born a loser or a winner.

319
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:51,868
Take Brandon here.

320
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:55,842
The day his momma shit him
out of her vag hole...

321
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,513
God rest her soul.

322
00:11:57,548 --> 00:11:58,716
He hit the ground a winner.

323
00:11:58,753 --> 00:12:00,821
Now, Serge on
the other hand.

324
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:02,222
I'm a real fuck up.

325
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:07,499
Well, let me tell
you what success is.

326
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:12,043
You see, I wake up in the
morning, I slam me down a

327
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,948
Red Bull and some vodka.

328
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:15,816
Go clubbing with
some young poon.

329
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:17,655
Take me some viagras.

330
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,461
And at the end of the
night, I squeeze me some

331
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:25,537
of the finest little young
tatas money can buy.

332
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:27,309
They're very big.

333
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:31,384
You see, I can
smells success.

334
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,692
Just like the
old man?

335
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,334
Not a friggin'
wiff of it on you.

336
00:12:39,903 --> 00:12:42,337
You know what?

337
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,410
Give these to
your old man.

338
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:46,848
That's barbeque flavor,
that's his favorite.

339
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:50,355
Give him something.

340
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,625
Anything.

341
00:12:52,831 --> 00:12:56,369
As far as you two, don't forget,
promotional party tonight.

342
00:12:56,404 --> 00:12:57,737
Peppermint Zebra.

343
00:12:57,774 --> 00:12:59,475
First lap dance is on me.

344
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:00,610
Yeah, daddy!

345
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,617
The second lap
dance is on me, too!

346
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:06,989
Honey, it's 1 o'clock.

347
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:09,495
It's time for our
couples' mani-pedi.

348
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:10,965
Hi, Denton.

349
00:13:11,001 --> 00:13:12,067
Hi, Kirsten.

350
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:13,435
Hey, it's Mrs.
Lucas to you.

351
00:13:13,472 --> 00:13:14,673
Mhm.

352
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:17,946
Mani-pedi headache
here we go.

353
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:19,448
Woo!

354
00:13:19,885 --> 00:13:21,853
Baker!

355
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,024
Where the fuck you
think you're going?

356
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:23,890
Sit down.

357
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:27,865
Are you done
being mean to me?

358
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:29,671
I got a present for you.

359
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,079
It's a go, bitch.

360
00:13:34,115 --> 00:13:36,418
You tell your little butt
buddies at that stupid

361
00:13:36,455 --> 00:13:39,158
video store that the CEO
of Lucas' Gourmet Condoms

362
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,726
signed off on everything.

363
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:41,827
Rosenburg drew
it up in legal.

364
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:43,967
He's a Jew so I assume it's
binding and everything.

365
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:45,534
You know?

366
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:47,673
I'm gonna watch you fail
and I'm gonna love every

367
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:48,576
second of it.

368
00:13:48,613 --> 00:13:55,525
Every damn second of it.

369
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:58,931
Is that...
Did you...

370
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:00,198
Can I go now?

371
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:01,735
Get the fuck out of here.

372
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:03,908
Let's the game begin.

373
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:07,582
-Cocksmoker!
-Better.

374
00:14:13,464 --> 00:14:16,100
What the hell is this?

375
00:14:16,136 --> 00:14:17,535
There he is!

376
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:19,907
That you, lucky
motherfucker, is a legal

377
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,140
and binding document.

378
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:23,447
That's right. Me and Jackson sat
down with Lucas' legal team

379
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:25,450
this morning and hammered
out all the details.

380
00:14:25,488 --> 00:14:27,690
I have to sleep with
twelve girls this summer

381
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:29,694
or the Lucas'
get my house?

382
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,701
Well, you're renting your
house to that asshole, Bob.

383
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,806
Technically, you
live in the garage.

384
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:35,907
What are you guys
lawyers now?

385
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,980
Well I actually had a lawyer
look over the details.

386
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:46,161
Hello! Offices of
Charles McDee.

387
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:48,801
And he may or may
not be my uncle.

388
00:14:48,836 --> 00:14:51,038
A contract?

389
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:56,149
Yeah, yeah.

390
00:14:56,184 --> 00:14:58,019
You good, man.
You're good.

391
00:14:58,056 --> 00:14:58,754
But don't worry, man.

392
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,926
We did all the
legwork for you.

393
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:06,035
My god.

394
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:10,477
That, my friend, is nine
of your school crushes.

395
00:15:10,514 --> 00:15:13,150
You actually picked out
most of them yourself.

396
00:15:13,187 --> 00:15:15,456
Wait, what are the
two empty slots for?

397
00:15:15,491 --> 00:15:17,693
You get to pick the
two wild card bitches.

398
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,730
That's right. As long as we
can prove you went to school

399
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:22,202
with them, you can decide
whoever you want.

400
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,043
Well now I think it's time
for a celebratory shake.

401
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:26,511
-Gentlemen? Yeah?
-No.

402
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:28,617
100% alright.
Thanks though.

403
00:15:28,653 --> 00:15:30,553
What the fuck's
going on here?

404
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:31,823
-Sorry, Bob.
-Sorry, Bob.

405
00:15:31,857 --> 00:15:34,159
Sorry is right, you
sorry motherfuckers.

406
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:36,899
What's those white bitches
doing on the wall?

407
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,237
These are all the girls that
Denton went to school with?

408
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,605
Yeah, he's
gonna fuck them.

409
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:41,408
He's gonna fuck them?

410
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:42,812
That guy is going
to fuck them?

411
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,046
He's going to get fucked?

412
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:46,052
You don't necessarily have to
sleep with them so you know.

413
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:48,288
No, you just
gotta bust a fat nut.

414
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:49,525
It doesn't matter how.

415
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:51,830
Handy, beej,
missionary.

416
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,871
Old country,
doggie, bukkake.

417
00:15:54,907 --> 00:15:56,908
Gang bang, facial, 69.

418
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:58,812
Cum dump truck,
shitty kitty.

419
00:15:58,847 --> 00:15:59,913
Yo, I like that one.

420
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:01,618
Shitty kitty,
shitty kitty.

421
00:16:01,654 --> 00:16:02,954
Or Siberian jizzsicle.

422
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,856
You know what I like?

423
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:05,960
Fucking Nigerian
cocksicle.

424
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:07,129
That's what I like.

425
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,201
The drill this shit out of
your big dry fucking asses.

426
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:11,036
-Bye, Bob.
-Bye, Bob.

427
00:16:11,072 --> 00:16:13,173
-Thanks.
-Fuck you.

428
00:16:13,211 --> 00:16:14,879
That's right. We just need
to have solid evidence

429
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:15,745
of each hookup.

430
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:17,115
Guys, I can't do this.

431
00:16:17,153 --> 00:16:19,053
This is your chance, D.

432
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,759
Your biological cock
is ticking, man.

433
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:24,731
Dude, if you do this, you
get 100% of the Lucas

434
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:26,201
Gourmet Condom company.

435
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,067
You get everything.

436
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:29,073
All associated
properties and holdings.

437
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,880
The video store stays open
and we can still play ball.

438
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:35,855
Can't lose the team, D.

439
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:38,326
Jackson might
kill himself.

440
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,836
And after what Mr.
Lucas did to your dad.

441
00:16:43,673 --> 00:16:45,240
Think about it.

442
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,331
Hey, champ.

443
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:58,267
Hey, Mr. Blossy.
How you doing?

444
00:16:58,303 --> 00:17:00,105
-Hey, kid.
-Hi.

445
00:17:00,142 --> 00:17:02,076
Is your dad home?

446
00:17:02,113 --> 00:17:03,245
Nope.

447
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,082
Don't think he's, no.

448
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:06,684
Is everything okay?

449
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:08,789
No, no.

450
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:14,869
Your dad's been stealing
my son's Legos.

451
00:17:14,904 --> 00:17:16,171
What?

452
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:17,774
Are you sure?

453
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:19,579
I've been picking
them up all day.

454
00:17:19,614 --> 00:17:20,613
Legos.

455
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:23,117
From my house
to your house.

456
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:24,320
He's...

457
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:25,957
He's had a rough go of it.

458
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:28,730
Well I think he's
getting worse.

459
00:17:43,198 --> 00:17:45,099
Maybe those assholes
were right.

460
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:47,969
Fuck yeah we are.

461
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:49,307
Get up, man.

462
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:50,409
You got chicks to do.

463
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,682
Wait a minute, what is Scott
Quaker doing up there?

464
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,055
You're gonna
laugh at this.

465
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:58,256
He's actually one
of your dates.

466
00:17:58,295 --> 00:17:59,961
-No! No, no.
-Okay, look!

467
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:02,066
For two of the dates you
only have to kiss.

468
00:18:02,102 --> 00:18:04,104
It's supposed to
be twelve girls.

469
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,676
You and Snot Shaker were
inseparable in the third grade.

470
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,243
Everybody knows you
had a crush on him.

471
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:08,980
Lucas wouldn't budge.

472
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:10,115
I didn't have
a crush on him.

473
00:18:10,152 --> 00:18:12,955
Listen, guys didn't even
like girls in the third grade.

474
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,759
I loved pussy in
the third grade.

475
00:18:14,796 --> 00:18:15,761
Ask Wiggins.

476
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:17,364
Yeah, it was pretty gross.

477
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:19,135
Here's the docs here
for your first date.

478
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:20,837
We pick the
sluttiest one first.

479
00:18:20,874 --> 00:18:23,108
Seventh grade,
Haley Matthews?

480
00:18:23,146 --> 00:18:26,016
I haven't even talked to
her in like fifteen years.

481
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:27,852
Surprise again.

482
00:18:27,888 --> 00:18:30,357
You've actually been talking
to her all day online.

483
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:31,661
We told her you ride a
Harley though because

484
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:32,628
she's into bad boys.

485
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:35,868
You sold me as a bad
boy to Haley Matthews?

486
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:38,173
How am I actually gonna
impress a girl like that?

487
00:18:38,211 --> 00:18:40,814
This, Denton, clearly
isn't doing the trick.

488
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:41,647
Fuck no.

489
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:43,451
But, I mean, what's
wrong with me?

490
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:44,988
I'm fine, right?

491
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:47,862
Okay, I guess I'll start....

492
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:50,701
You don't put any
product in your hair.

493
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:51,836
You're always talking
about bands that

494
00:18:51,873 --> 00:18:53,038
no one's ever heard of.

495
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:56,678
Like I'm sorry, guys, but
who the fuck is Black Sabbath?

496
00:18:57,317 --> 00:19:00,086
Yeah, man. You live
in a garage.

497
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:03,660
Wiggins, you live
in a garage with me.

498
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:05,163
Yeah.

499
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,769
You're gonna have
to shave your shaft.

500
00:19:07,804 --> 00:19:11,075
Your taint, your grundle,
your satchel page.

501
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:13,747
You gotta be as bald as
a Scandinavian turtle.

502
00:19:13,782 --> 00:19:14,715
It's gotta fucking shine.

503
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:17,253
I gotta see my face in
your right nut, man.

504
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,994
Look, I'm dressed like a
Crip's stepfather right now.

505
00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:22,097
Does it matter?

506
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:24,469
No, because I'm confident.

507
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:26,475
You just gotta be
confident in who you are.

508
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:29,981
Or in this case,
who you are not.

509
00:19:34,894 --> 00:19:37,329
Look man, I get it.

510
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:39,433
You're in a rut.

511
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:41,972
Are you gonna do
something about it?

512
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:44,747
If you're not gonna
do it for you...

513
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,065
Alright, let's do it.

514
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:55,398
-Fuck yeah.
-Nice.

515
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:12,935
Hi...

516
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:16,277
I'm sorry, is
this 264 Pacific?

517
00:20:16,313 --> 00:20:17,813
Denton!

518
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,367
-Hi.
-Hi, Hailey!

519
00:20:28,404 --> 00:20:30,240
My god, you
look so great.

520
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:33,446
You look, I can't tell.

521
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,481
I know, right? I mean,
who would've thought?

522
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,818
Not me.

523
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:41,394
Where's your Harley?

524
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:44,537
Yeah, it's in the shop.

525
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:47,208
Seat's broken.

526
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:49,211
Well, we're
all ready to go.

527
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:50,914
We?

528
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:35,909
Rolling Rocks tonight, baby!

529
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,530
My therapist thought it
would be a good idea if I

530
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,302
had a major life change.

531
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:50,704
So here I am.

532
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:52,375
This was...

533
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:53,344
This is a big one.

534
00:21:57,623 --> 00:22:02,128
Yeah, started a pretty sweet
softball team with my buddies.

535
00:22:02,164 --> 00:22:06,404
My dad's building a
woman out of Legos.

536
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,149
I sell my sperm
at a sperm bank.

537
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:14,153
I thought you were
a cage fighter.

538
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:18,861
Yeah.

539
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,499
Here's the interesting
part of the story.

540
00:22:20,535 --> 00:22:22,168
Well...

541
00:22:22,204 --> 00:22:25,009
The best part of the story
is coming right now.

542
00:22:25,046 --> 00:22:27,480
I was living in this
apartment and there was

543
00:22:27,518 --> 00:22:34,194
this old Asian
handyman who taught me to

544
00:22:34,231 --> 00:22:38,704
paint fences
and wash cars.

545
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,541
Stuff like that.

546
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,084
So you know what?

547
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:47,523
I was like, this sucks.

548
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:51,596
Being a teen with problems
and no direction, this is

549
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:53,299
not the life I want.

550
00:22:53,336 --> 00:22:56,272
But you know, turns out he
was a martial arts master

551
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:59,113
and he taught
me a few things.

552
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,251
A blonde kid with
feathered hair gave me a

553
00:23:01,287 --> 00:23:03,255
rash of shit and
I was like...

554
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:06,028
Let's enter a tournament
together of karate.

555
00:23:06,064 --> 00:23:11,272
And I craned kicked
him in the face.

556
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,009
And that sorta thing just,
you know, naturally leads

557
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:16,115
to cage fighting.

558
00:23:16,152 --> 00:23:17,384
That's so cool.

559
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:18,553
Yeah.

560
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:19,689
What's your
finishing move?

561
00:23:20,594 --> 00:23:24,698
Finishing move,
finishing move is the...

562
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:28,507
head butt to the nuts.

563
00:23:28,544 --> 00:23:31,213
Yeah, I get a handful of
those nards and just

564
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:33,049
boom, boom, boom, boom.

565
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:35,086
Six or seven times...

566
00:23:37,494 --> 00:23:42,400
So you have a girlfriend
or a wife or something?

567
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:44,307
Nah, I don't need the ag.
You know?

568
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:50,821
Yeah, it's just my
chopper, cage, and tats.

569
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:51,721
Tattoos?

570
00:23:51,758 --> 00:23:52,790
Yup, yup.

571
00:23:52,827 --> 00:23:54,461
Yeah, it's a
full back piece.

572
00:23:54,498 --> 00:23:57,668
Yeah, hour's work.
It's a yakuza tattoo.

573
00:23:57,701 --> 00:24:00,238
Yeah, but instead
of a samurai,

574
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:02,343
it's Arnold Schwarzenegger.

575
00:24:02,378 --> 00:24:07,453
Squat thrusting Mars.

576
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,692
I've got to see that.

577
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:10,760
Sorry, I can't, baby.

578
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:11,663
No, can't do it.

579
00:24:11,698 --> 00:24:12,663
What?

580
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,504
Yeah, it melted off in
the explosion when I was

581
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,506
escaping the state pen.

582
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:20,747
My god, that is so hot.

583
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,159
What is it?

584
00:24:26,195 --> 00:24:28,530
The sisters warned
me this could happen.

585
00:24:29,703 --> 00:24:31,672
What? What could happen?

586
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:37,349
Sisters.

587
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:42,860
I will never forget the
time we've spent together.

588
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:45,197
Your life lessons and
blessings will stay with

589
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,504
me all the days
of my life.

590
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,544
Unfortunately, the
exorcism performed on my

591
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:56,521
devil pussy has failed.

592
00:24:58,662 --> 00:25:01,332
I want you to fuck
me until I tap out.

593
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:03,669
Holy shit.

594
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:04,771
Hallelujah.

595
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:06,811
Hallelujah!

596
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:09,850
Your knee's on my neck.

597
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,118
I'm sorry.

598
00:25:22,746 --> 00:25:24,581
Eleven to go, boys!

599
00:25:24,616 --> 00:25:25,682
-Yes!
-Yes!

600
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:26,317
Nice.

601
00:25:26,354 --> 00:25:28,489
Details, details, details!

602
00:25:28,525 --> 00:25:29,457
It was not real.

603
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:31,762
She did like porno stuff.

604
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:32,629
Of course.

605
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,599
Butthole?

606
00:25:35,538 --> 00:25:37,172
Yours?

607
00:25:38,778 --> 00:25:41,548
Butthole, butthole,
butthole, butthole,

608
00:25:41,584 --> 00:25:43,485
butthole, butthole!

609
00:25:45,424 --> 00:25:46,657
Yeah!

610
00:25:46,694 --> 00:25:49,196
Big D's gonna go big
over all you bitches.

611
00:25:50,938 --> 00:25:51,736
It's everywhere.

612
00:25:51,772 --> 00:25:53,238
It's in your mouth.

613
00:25:53,273 --> 00:25:54,773
It's in your
fucking mouth.

614
00:25:56,582 --> 00:25:58,550
I would tongue
kiss Leo DiCaprio.

615
00:25:58,586 --> 00:25:59,619
What are you saying?

616
00:25:59,655 --> 00:26:02,259
He has supple lips, it's
possible that whenever...

617
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,467
D, straight up
now tell me.

618
00:26:06,502 --> 00:26:08,737
Did you really fuck
clap trap Matthews?

619
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:09,740
That's disgusting.

620
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:11,144
Hope you double
bagged it, man.

621
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,883
But because I'm a
gentlemen and a scholar,

622
00:26:13,917 --> 00:26:15,852
I got you a little present.

623
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,456
Rain jimmies
on this bitch.

624
00:26:17,491 --> 00:26:18,557
No. Come on.

625
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:19,729
Just stop it.

626
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,167
Hey, gram this.
I wanna keep it.

627
00:26:24,472 --> 00:26:25,705
Hashtag blessed.

628
00:26:25,741 --> 00:26:28,912
Hashtag clean these
up you fucking idiots.

629
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:34,924
Wiggins, hand me a condom.

630
00:26:37,232 --> 00:26:39,969
Brussel sprouts or
Thai Sweet Chili?

631
00:26:40,005 --> 00:26:43,843
Thai Sweet Chili.

632
00:26:48,522 --> 00:26:49,655
Alright, guys.

633
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:53,696
Let's throw some greenery on
that scenery for Destiny.

634
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:55,601
Welcome to church,
gentlemen.

635
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,346
Remember, Ed said smart
girls want to be hot and

636
00:27:01,383 --> 00:27:03,684
hot girls want
to be smart.

637
00:27:04,387 --> 00:27:05,486
What the fuck
does Ed know?

638
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:07,360
He's home with his wife.

639
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:56,294
You must be really good at
math to be able to count

640
00:27:56,329 --> 00:27:57,797
up all those ones.

641
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:58,798
Yeah, I guess.

642
00:27:58,835 --> 00:28:01,805
I mean, it can be really
hard to keep track of

643
00:28:01,842 --> 00:28:05,713
especially if people throw in
fives when they really like me.

644
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,550
That's a valid point.

645
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,320
Did you wanna
get a lap dance?

646
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,523
They're two for
one right now.

647
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,029
That means that you get
two lap dances, but you

648
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:15,900
only pay for one.

649
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:18,805
You are good at math.
That's...

650
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:20,844
I would love one.

651
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:22,047
Two.

652
00:28:36,046 --> 00:28:39,584
I've just received news
from the other side.

653
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:42,423
The dark lord has special
instructions for us.

654
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:44,560
No, how's he doing?

655
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,437
He's well and says
thank you for asking.

656
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:52,076
You're welcome.

657
00:28:52,112 --> 00:28:53,980
You're welcome.

658
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,723
I'm getting a message from
the dark lord himself

659
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:01,326
right now.

660
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,463
What news does he bring?

661
00:29:07,442 --> 00:29:11,379
He says that we should
consummate our unholy

662
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:16,090
tryst on this unhallowed
ground this very eve.

663
00:29:16,128 --> 00:29:17,761
-He does?
-Mhm, yes.

664
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,500
Yes, he does.

665
00:29:21,873 --> 00:29:23,641
Then you must be
the chosen one.

666
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:26,111
I am totally that guy.

667
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:28,583
Then we must commence
this ritual immediately.

668
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:29,752
Okay.

669
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:31,355
Here, put this on.

670
00:29:31,393 --> 00:29:33,094
The neighbors are always
complaining about the noise.

671
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,663
It'll just take a minute.

672
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:41,745
Don't worry.

673
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,682
It only hurts
a little bit.

674
00:30:25,605 --> 00:30:27,172
You ready?

675
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:28,476
You ready?

676
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:32,517
Let's go.

677
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:50,017
Carly.

678
00:30:50,054 --> 00:30:50,952
Carly.

679
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,124
Hey.

680
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:23,856
That's a big dragon?

681
00:31:23,892 --> 00:31:25,860
These are big sharp teeth?

682
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:28,064
What does he say?

683
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:30,736
-Rawr!
-Rawr!

684
00:31:31,942 --> 00:31:32,640
Excuse me, sir.

685
00:31:32,676 --> 00:31:33,609
Can I help you
with something?

686
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:36,248
No, I'm just checking
out this hot chick.

687
00:31:37,653 --> 00:31:38,720
You know what?

688
00:31:38,756 --> 00:31:39,989
No, no, I love kids.

689
00:31:40,026 --> 00:31:41,125
I don't love...

690
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:42,795
They love...

691
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:45,968
Sh... Hey!

692
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:47,172
Hi.

693
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:50,075
My god, Denton?

694
00:31:50,112 --> 00:31:52,614
- My god.
- Denton Baker?

695
00:31:52,651 --> 00:31:55,053
From Abrams
Elementary, right?

696
00:31:55,088 --> 00:31:56,121
Yeah, Amanda Morrison.

697
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,162
Look at...
You got tall.

698
00:31:59,196 --> 00:32:01,198
You're, you're big.

699
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:04,237
God, that is crazy.

700
00:32:04,276 --> 00:32:06,678
I can't believe you still
hang out with those guys.

701
00:32:06,713 --> 00:32:09,817
What is Jackson up to?

702
00:32:09,853 --> 00:32:13,624
Jackson thinks he's
a personal trainer.

703
00:32:14,364 --> 00:32:16,664
-Wait, what?
-Yeah, yeah.

704
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,799
He got in shape?

705
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,202
No, no, he did not.

706
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:21,607
He just he works the
graveyard shift at the

707
00:32:21,644 --> 00:32:22,911
24-hour gym.

708
00:32:22,946 --> 00:32:25,248
So like one person comes
in and he's like I'm

709
00:32:25,285 --> 00:32:26,784
personally training them.

710
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,019
Okay, that makes
more sense.

711
00:32:28,057 --> 00:32:29,289
Yeah.

712
00:32:29,326 --> 00:32:30,826
What about you?

713
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:31,928
What have you been up to?

714
00:32:31,965 --> 00:32:32,964
Where are you working now?

715
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,941
I got into
cage fighting.

716
00:32:37,978 --> 00:32:39,913
Really? Cage like...

717
00:32:42,688 --> 00:32:44,187
No, you didn't.

718
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:46,625
Seriously, where
are you working?

719
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:48,832
Actually I'm in
the movie business.

720
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,068
That's even worse
than cage fighting.

721
00:32:51,105 --> 00:32:53,240
Well, it's kinda true.

722
00:32:53,277 --> 00:32:55,846
I still work at
Video Fun Time.

723
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:56,948
Really?

724
00:32:56,984 --> 00:32:58,083
Still?

725
00:32:58,121 --> 00:32:59,254
Yeah.

726
00:32:59,288 --> 00:33:00,487
Well, not for much longer
actually because the Lucas'

727
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:05,163
bought out the building for
their gourmet condom business.

728
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:07,134
That is...

729
00:33:07,171 --> 00:33:09,606
-That's disgusting.
-Yeah.

730
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:13,346
Well this is me.

731
00:33:13,384 --> 00:33:18,992
So super cool bumping
into you, Denton.

732
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,100
You know what?

733
00:33:22,136 --> 00:33:25,608
Would you wanna continue
this conversation sometime?

734
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:28,079
Nope.

735
00:33:28,983 --> 00:33:30,149
Is that a...

736
00:33:30,185 --> 00:33:31,251
-What...
-Yes.

737
00:33:32,191 --> 00:33:33,790
Yeah, I'd love to
catch up some more.

738
00:33:33,826 --> 00:33:34,925
Cool, cool.

739
00:33:34,961 --> 00:33:38,164
How's 8 tonight?
Is that...

740
00:33:38,202 --> 00:33:40,003
Yeah, sure!

741
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:42,307
We can get that
cup of coffee.

742
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,278
Cool.

743
00:33:45,084 --> 00:33:46,717
Here, let me...

744
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:54,733
Meet me here.

745
00:33:57,476 --> 00:33:59,009
Stop looking at
my cock, man.

746
00:33:59,046 --> 00:33:59,811
I'm not.

747
00:33:59,847 --> 00:34:01,715
You're peeing on
the bathroom side.

748
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:04,019
I'm doing dishes
on the right side.

749
00:34:05,157 --> 00:34:06,657
Where the fuck
have you been?

750
00:34:06,695 --> 00:34:07,862
Well I'm sorry,
Schwartzkopf.

751
00:34:07,896 --> 00:34:09,764
I was busy playing
stalker at the daycare.

752
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,701
In fact, I'm lucky I
didn't get arrested.

753
00:34:11,737 --> 00:34:13,237
Yeah, that
Morrison chick.

754
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:14,775
How's she looking
nowadays?

755
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:16,778
Great, yeah.

756
00:34:16,815 --> 00:34:18,817
She seems really
cool, too.

757
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:19,851
Yeah? How'd you hit that?

758
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:20,921
HJ?

759
00:34:20,956 --> 00:34:22,089
No, I did not.

760
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,025
You know, BJ?

761
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,260
No.

762
00:34:24,297 --> 00:34:25,730
- FJ?
- Get off me.

763
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:26,732
Did you get one
of those FJ's?

764
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:27,434
I did not get...

765
00:34:27,472 --> 00:34:28,405
I didn't get an FJ.

766
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,875
I didn't have quite the
time that I needed.

767
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:32,210
I couldn't close the
deal, but right now,

768
00:34:32,248 --> 00:34:33,949
I'm actually going
to see Amanda.

769
00:34:33,983 --> 00:34:35,284
But this is a
mandatory meeting.

770
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,253
You can do this
one without me.

771
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:38,157
I swear to god, you're
doing amazing work.

772
00:34:38,193 --> 00:34:39,427
Goodbye.

773
00:34:39,463 --> 00:34:42,366
Denton, remember to be the man,
you have to beat off the man.

774
00:34:42,402 --> 00:34:43,501
It's beat the man.

775
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,175
If you want to be the man,
you have to beat the man.

776
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,913
You don't wanna
beat him off.

777
00:34:48,947 --> 00:34:49,846
Yeah.

778
00:34:51,954 --> 00:34:53,520
But do you remember
that story that

779
00:34:53,557 --> 00:34:55,458
you got up in front of the
entire second grade class

780
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:57,229
and you read it out
loud to everybody?

781
00:34:57,266 --> 00:34:58,132
Yeah.

782
00:34:58,166 --> 00:34:59,867
I can't believe
you remember that.

783
00:34:59,903 --> 00:35:01,170
Of course I do.

784
00:35:01,206 --> 00:35:02,840
Donny the Lucky Donkey.

785
00:35:02,878 --> 00:35:07,048
Actually it was the Donny,
the Down on His Luck Donkey.

786
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:12,260
How come? How did you
never get married?

787
00:35:12,297 --> 00:35:14,097
Well my dad was in the
coast guard so we moved

788
00:35:14,134 --> 00:35:17,003
around a lot when I was a kid
and then I guess after I got

789
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:20,111
my teaching degree, I carried
on the family tradition.

790
00:35:20,146 --> 00:35:21,379
So you're saying
you're a gypsy?

791
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:23,384
No, I'm not a gypsy.

792
00:35:23,418 --> 00:35:25,753
Sounds like what
a gypsy would say.

793
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:28,260
No, my girlfriends are all
getting married and having

794
00:35:28,297 --> 00:35:30,965
kids and I'm just happy
that I've finally found a

795
00:35:31,001 --> 00:35:32,301
place to settle
down and write.

796
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,237
So you're a writer?

797
00:35:33,273 --> 00:35:35,911
Well I'm writing a book.

798
00:35:35,945 --> 00:35:39,449
It's a self-help book
about how parents aren't

799
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:42,155
really instilling enough
self-confidence in their

800
00:35:42,192 --> 00:35:44,929
kids and the affect that
it has on them later on in

801
00:35:44,963 --> 00:35:46,463
their adult lives.

802
00:35:47,269 --> 00:35:48,302
What about you?

803
00:35:48,338 --> 00:35:51,508
It's hard to go out and
date when you're living in

804
00:35:51,543 --> 00:35:53,478
a garage with your dad.

805
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:58,891
That's hysterical.

806
00:35:59,626 --> 00:36:01,429
God, you're
really serious.

807
00:36:01,465 --> 00:36:03,333
Kinda.

808
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,402
How did that happen?

809
00:36:04,438 --> 00:36:07,407
God, I thought your dad
was a successful inventor.

810
00:36:07,443 --> 00:36:10,081
Well he was until his
greatest invention was

811
00:36:10,115 --> 00:36:12,016
stolen out from right
underneath him.

812
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:13,920
What was it?

813
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:15,423
Gourmet Condom.

814
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,060
-No!
-Mhm.

815
00:36:17,097 --> 00:36:19,233
Wait, how did your dad
even come up with the idea

816
00:36:19,268 --> 00:36:22,071
for a gourmet condom
in the first place?

817
00:36:22,106 --> 00:36:22,737
I don't wanna do this.

818
00:36:22,777 --> 00:36:24,210
See, we're
having a coffee.

819
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:25,345
It's a really
wonderful time.

820
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,178
I don't wanna
screw anything...

821
00:36:26,215 --> 00:36:27,281
Come on.

822
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,251
I can't go back.

823
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,021
You know, once I say
it, it can't be unsaid.

824
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:30,688
I dare you.
Bring it on.

825
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:32,526
Let's go.
Gross me out.

826
00:36:32,563 --> 00:36:35,166
Well before I was born, my
parents went on this kind

827
00:36:35,201 --> 00:36:37,436
of zany, wacky diet where
they couldn't eat anything

828
00:36:37,472 --> 00:36:38,405
after midnight.

829
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,076
My mom goes off to the
other room to put on

830
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:42,512
something a little
more comfortable.

831
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,851
My dad seeing this as an
opportunity to cheat on

832
00:36:44,887 --> 00:36:47,424
the diet, grabs BBQ
chicken wing and starts

833
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,393
mowing down on it.

834
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:51,866
The fray of all of this,
he gets the chicken

835
00:36:51,902 --> 00:36:54,037
drippings all
over his junk.

836
00:36:54,074 --> 00:36:56,175
Fuck.

837
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:59,447
My mom sneaks in, surprised
the hell out of him.

838
00:37:00,353 --> 00:37:05,193
They're in a position where
they're going to have relations.

839
00:37:06,298 --> 00:37:09,036
Phillip, you
taste delicious.

840
00:37:09,072 --> 00:37:11,373
And my mom doesn't
seem to mind it.

841
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:12,474
I know.

842
00:37:12,512 --> 00:37:15,850
His wheels starting turning
and the rest is history.

843
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:17,384
My dad doesn't know how to
balance a checkbook, let

844
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,987
alone run a company.

845
00:37:19,023 --> 00:37:20,623
So Mr. Lucas
offers his help.

846
00:37:20,661 --> 00:37:22,863
In the interim,
my mom gets sick.

847
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,034
Lucas says, you know what?
Don't worry about it.

848
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,405
While you're gone, I will
get this business started

849
00:37:27,443 --> 00:37:28,376
and running.

850
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:30,378
So we're watching TV
a couple weeks later.

851
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:34,286
And there's an ad for
Lucas' gourmet condoms.

852
00:37:34,324 --> 00:37:36,125
Didn't you guys get
a lawyer? Anything?

853
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,559
We got a lawyer,
we tried to do all that,

854
00:37:37,597 --> 00:37:39,130
but my dad didn't
have any copyrights.

855
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:41,369
He didn't have any proof
like solid evidence.

856
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:45,309
And from then on, it's just
been this downward spiral.

857
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:48,484
My god.
That is so fucked up.

858
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,485
But you know what?

859
00:37:49,521 --> 00:37:52,324
This actually would make
a really great example

860
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,326
for my book.

861
00:37:53,362 --> 00:37:57,133
Hear me out, your complete
and utter lack of

862
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,471
self-confidence has
led you to be not only

863
00:37:59,509 --> 00:38:03,213
jobless, but homeless
and girl-less as well.

864
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:04,617
My god, thank you!

865
00:38:04,652 --> 00:38:06,653
No, seriously!

866
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,061
Yet the only thing that
you are lacking is

867
00:38:10,097 --> 00:38:11,463
testicular fortitude.

868
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:12,464
What are you
talking about?

869
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:14,436
Balls, Denton.

870
00:38:15,072 --> 00:38:18,577
Look, I am, I am
very confident.

871
00:38:18,614 --> 00:38:19,680
Really?

872
00:38:19,717 --> 00:38:21,452
Hi.

873
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:23,120
I'm Denton.

874
00:38:23,157 --> 00:38:25,025
Would you maybe like
wanna, I don't know,

875
00:38:25,061 --> 00:38:26,193
go on a coffee
date with me?

876
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,498
Even though all I'm gonna
do is drink peppermint tea.

877
00:38:28,536 --> 00:38:31,072
That was a C minus
impression at best.

878
00:38:31,106 --> 00:38:32,574
Really?

879
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,045
What is this
pussy ass drink?

880
00:38:35,081 --> 00:38:38,685
It's filled with antioxidants
and fights cervical cancer.

881
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:41,226
So you look kinda
dumb right now.

882
00:38:41,262 --> 00:38:46,001
Look, this is gonna be the
summer that I change your life.

883
00:38:46,038 --> 00:38:48,507
And I get to document
it in my book.

884
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:51,513
I Have the Balls
of an 8-Year-Old.

885
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,284
Elegant, yet sexy.

886
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,286
I'm gonna go to
the bathroom.

887
00:38:54,322 --> 00:38:55,322
You think about it.

888
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:57,092
I'll be back.

889
00:38:57,128 --> 00:38:58,461
Scream that title again.
What was it?

890
00:38:58,496 --> 00:38:59,562
Shut up.

891
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:01,365
Denton.

892
00:39:01,402 --> 00:39:03,403
You're my fucking
hero, man.

893
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,110
It's been an honor watching
wet your kilt tonight.

894
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,985
I know you're gonna fuck
all these hot bitches.

895
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,126
How do you know
about that?

896
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:16,097
Sensei Jackson didn't
tell you about me?

897
00:39:16,132 --> 00:39:18,300
I'm his star pupil, man.

898
00:39:18,338 --> 00:39:20,039
Remember a couple years
back when that guy had to

899
00:39:20,074 --> 00:39:21,574
be cut out of his house.

900
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:22,443
Yeah.

901
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,545
That was me.

902
00:39:23,581 --> 00:39:26,418
I weighed 750
fucking pounds.

903
00:39:26,456 --> 00:39:30,594
I had to prop my titties up on a
towel rack just to dry them off.

904
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,065
That's about when Sensei
Jackson found me.

905
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:35,571
Put me on a grueling
training reg.

906
00:39:35,608 --> 00:39:40,347
Had me sucking in his sweet,
delicious power shakes.

907
00:39:40,384 --> 00:39:42,284
He fucking saved
my life, man.

908
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,686
The dude is a saint.

909
00:39:43,724 --> 00:39:45,459
Hey, will you
autograph my cock?

910
00:39:45,494 --> 00:39:47,195
Nope! Hey!

911
00:39:49,068 --> 00:39:51,336
You wanna
get out of here?

912
00:39:51,371 --> 00:39:54,275
Yes, let's.

913
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:57,115
Hope you two had
a great night.

914
00:39:57,552 --> 00:39:59,320
You're the shit, dude.

915
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,090
The shit!

916
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:03,428
Free video, free video,
free video, free video,

917
00:40:03,465 --> 00:40:04,565
free video, free video...

918
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:07,369
Wiggins, Wiggins!
Who's that for?

919
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,572
Me.

920
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,108
Free video, free video...

921
00:40:10,144 --> 00:40:11,778
You work here.
Why would you...

922
00:40:11,815 --> 00:40:13,616
Dude wait, one of your
crushes are coming.

923
00:40:13,652 --> 00:40:14,416
Who?

924
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,452
D man!

925
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:16,253
What's up, dog?

926
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:17,457
High.

927
00:40:17,492 --> 00:40:18,625
Low.

928
00:40:18,663 --> 00:40:20,128
Let me see if
you're my bro.

929
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,533
So new release day.

930
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:22,835
Talk to me.

931
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:24,873
Any new jizz flicks drop?

932
00:40:24,909 --> 00:40:26,576
Everything new is
in the back, Scott.

933
00:40:26,612 --> 00:40:27,846
Alright, sweet.

934
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,215
I'll be back in a sec
because it only takes me

935
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:31,353
a minute to sin it.

936
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:33,524
You remember now, come on.

937
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:35,228
He seems like a power top.

938
00:40:35,264 --> 00:40:36,597
You into that?

939
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:37,599
Wiggins.

940
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,570
Dude, I am not hooking
up with a dude, dude.

941
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:42,175
Okay, well first of all,
if you did, I'm a good

942
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,677
enough friend that I
wouldn't tell anybody.

943
00:40:43,715 --> 00:40:45,449
Second of all, all you
have to do is give him a

944
00:40:45,483 --> 00:40:46,616
little bit of tongue
and just...

945
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,919
I'm not gonna do it, man!

946
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:48,855
I don't care.

947
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:50,324
Jackson's gonna have
to figure this out.

948
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,192
I'm not gonna do it.

949
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,094
I'll lose the whole bet.
I don't care.

950
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:54,266
Hey, what bet you
boys talking about?

951
00:40:54,302 --> 00:40:55,100
Nothing, nothing.

952
00:40:55,137 --> 00:40:57,440
Alright, fuck it
well, I got my MMA.

953
00:40:57,474 --> 00:40:58,807
I got my porno.

954
00:40:58,846 --> 00:41:01,615
I'm ready to jack and jack
off right there, you know.

955
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,382
Hit me.

956
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,253
That's pretty literal.

957
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:05,824
Okay, we got Ben Her.

958
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,826
Citizen Came.

959
00:41:06,862 --> 00:41:08,697
Woodfellas.

960
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:09,599
Deep Impact.

961
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:12,338
No, actually this
one's not a porno.

962
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:13,071
Did you know that?

963
00:41:13,108 --> 00:41:15,242
I'm a pervert,
not an idiot.

964
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,914
Scott, man.

965
00:41:16,951 --> 00:41:18,117
I can't rent you these.

966
00:41:18,152 --> 00:41:20,822
You've had Stop or My Mom Will
Squirt out for two years.

967
00:41:20,858 --> 00:41:22,927
Man, Denton your my
brother and you know the

968
00:41:22,963 --> 00:41:25,666
last decade's been a bit
of a buttfuck for me.

969
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:28,536
You know, my MMA career
was going great then I got

970
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:31,376
busted for being on the
juice and cycled off to

971
00:41:31,413 --> 00:41:33,481
lose the titties and then
I started getting my ass

972
00:41:33,516 --> 00:41:34,782
kicked real bad.

973
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,955
Had to tap out
on the dream.

974
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,023
Listen, okay.

975
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:39,692
You can rent these, but
you gotta bring them back

976
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,798
before the store
closes, okay man?

977
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:45,239
You have my word as a
retired man of the cage.

978
00:41:45,275 --> 00:41:46,875
I'll bring these
back safely.

979
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,447
Knock on my wood.

980
00:41:49,485 --> 00:41:50,718
He's full of those, isn't he?

981
00:41:51,855 --> 00:41:52,853
Hey, Denise.

982
00:41:52,891 --> 00:41:53,889
-Hi.
-Hey.

983
00:41:53,927 --> 00:41:55,393
You know what, these
packages keep getting sent

984
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,596
over the video store.

985
00:41:56,632 --> 00:41:58,733
I'm sorry. It's just those guys
messing with you I'm sure.

986
00:41:58,771 --> 00:41:59,937
Sure is, motherfucker.

987
00:41:59,972 --> 00:42:01,440
Boom, bitch!

988
00:42:01,474 --> 00:42:04,243
Dikembe says
not in my house.

989
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,780
Hey, Serge, you wanna
go old school on this

990
00:42:05,817 --> 00:42:06,614
little baby pussy?

991
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:07,552
-Yeah.
-Hey, guys!

992
00:42:07,588 --> 00:42:09,522
Come on!
No, no, no, no, no!

993
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,195
Does it feel good?

994
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:13,297
Higher!

995
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:14,666
Higher!

996
00:42:14,704 --> 00:42:16,237
Hey, hey!

997
00:42:16,273 --> 00:42:17,271
No wonder you've
only at four girls.

998
00:42:17,307 --> 00:42:18,775
You're wearing
boxer shorts.

999
00:42:18,811 --> 00:42:20,746
Bitches love briefs now.

1000
00:42:20,782 --> 00:42:21,681
Come on, man.

1001
00:42:21,717 --> 00:42:22,982
We're going to H&M.
We'll buy you some.

1002
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:25,288
Clean this shit up, Denise.

1003
00:42:25,324 --> 00:42:26,456
Yeah, clean that
shit up, Denise.

1004
00:42:26,492 --> 00:42:28,427
Denton, I'm so sorry!

1005
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:29,529
Let me help you.

1006
00:42:29,565 --> 00:42:30,865
Thanks.

1007
00:42:32,438 --> 00:42:35,442
You know, Denton, we
had homeroom together.

1008
00:42:35,478 --> 00:42:36,377
That's right.

1009
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:37,314
-In eleventh grade.
-In eleventh grade.

1010
00:42:39,387 --> 00:42:40,420
Yeah.

1011
00:42:40,454 --> 00:42:43,357
So I'm gonna take my
fifteen minute break now.

1012
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,561
Yeah, okay.

1013
00:42:44,597 --> 00:42:48,268
Yeah, and that's just enough
time for me to suck you off.

1014
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:48,969
What now?

1015
00:42:56,456 --> 00:42:57,689
Bring it up.
Let's dig deep!

1016
00:42:57,724 --> 00:42:58,690
Dig in!

1017
00:42:58,726 --> 00:42:59,925
Dig in, let's get it!

1018
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:01,831
Let's get it, you
little bitches.

1019
00:43:01,867 --> 00:43:02,632
Come on, grandpa.

1020
00:43:02,668 --> 00:43:03,900
Pick it up.
Pick it up, Wilfred.

1021
00:43:03,936 --> 00:43:04,869
I am number one,
you're right.

1022
00:43:04,907 --> 00:43:05,840
Thank you.

1023
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:07,275
Why don't you hop on
a bike, Uncle Jemima?

1024
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:08,744
-Here we go.
-Jesus Christ, man.

1025
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,846
Calm down.

1026
00:43:09,882 --> 00:43:11,817
What are you rushing the
bloods and the crips, dude?

1027
00:43:11,853 --> 00:43:13,989
I'm wearing both colors
to signify unity.

1028
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:16,327
That's kinda cool.

1029
00:43:16,362 --> 00:43:17,894
Come on, grandpa.
You can do it.

1030
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:20,266
So funny bit of news.

1031
00:43:20,304 --> 00:43:22,572
I just got surprise
fellatio from the

1032
00:43:22,608 --> 00:43:23,842
receptionist that
works at Lucas...

1033
00:43:23,876 --> 00:43:25,443
Denise Davids?

1034
00:43:25,481 --> 00:43:26,648
- Yes!
- Shit.

1035
00:43:26,684 --> 00:43:28,619
You are so screwed.

1036
00:43:28,655 --> 00:43:29,586
What?

1037
00:43:29,623 --> 00:43:31,925
World class
psycho stalker.

1038
00:43:31,961 --> 00:43:33,929
You know in school when
those girls made those

1039
00:43:33,965 --> 00:43:36,300
origami things to predict
who their soulmate was?

1040
00:43:36,338 --> 00:43:37,571
-Yeah?
-She rigged hers.

1041
00:43:37,608 --> 00:43:40,544
Rigged the fucking
thing, dude.

1042
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:41,578
Gross.

1043
00:43:41,614 --> 00:43:43,815
Yeah, she had one of those
things where like...

1044
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:47,490
You know when one person loves
another person like a lot,

1045
00:43:47,528 --> 00:43:50,666
but the other person loves
the other person more.

1046
00:43:50,701 --> 00:43:52,534
She got a restraining
order against her.

1047
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,938
Okay, okay.

1048
00:43:53,974 --> 00:43:55,775
She's nuts for real.

1049
00:43:55,811 --> 00:43:57,711
She had her dog baptized.

1050
00:43:59,918 --> 00:44:01,418
Hello?

1051
00:44:02,692 --> 00:44:03,824
It's her.

1052
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:08,400
Gotcha.

1053
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:11,809
You've reached the
voicemail of Denton.

1054
00:44:11,844 --> 00:44:12,910
Leave a message.

1055
00:44:14,617 --> 00:44:15,917
Beep.

1056
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:18,021
Not convincing.

1057
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:19,991
I didn't do a
good job at all.

1058
00:44:20,028 --> 00:44:20,927
No.

1059
00:44:25,905 --> 00:44:27,572
No one's home.

1060
00:44:29,614 --> 00:44:30,813
God.

1061
00:44:30,849 --> 00:44:32,751
What is that smell?

1062
00:44:37,563 --> 00:44:38,829
Denton, Denton, Denton.

1063
00:44:38,865 --> 00:44:40,835
You've been busy, girl.

1064
00:44:42,007 --> 00:44:43,006
Hey, Serge, Go
wet that bed.

1065
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:44,009
Alright.

1066
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:48,418
Think the tall
fuck's got it in him?

1067
00:44:48,454 --> 00:44:50,655
-Nah.
-I'm gonna piss on top.

1068
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:54,730
What the fuck's
going on here?

1069
00:44:54,766 --> 00:44:55,698
Who the fuck are you?

1070
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:56,835
What are you doing here?

1071
00:44:56,869 --> 00:44:58,536
Tell him what
we're doing here.

1072
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:00,074
We broke in.

1073
00:45:00,112 --> 00:45:02,012
Obvious yes, you're
fucking break in.

1074
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:03,080
-Can I talk to you?
-I got this, B.

1075
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,583
Can you come here
a little bit?

1076
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:05,819
Are you fucking sure?

1077
00:45:05,856 --> 00:45:07,122
He's got a knife.

1078
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:07,856
Yeah, I see that.

1079
00:45:07,893 --> 00:45:08,958
It's fine, it's
fine, it's fine!

1080
00:45:08,994 --> 00:45:10,394
Well why are you here?

1081
00:45:10,432 --> 00:45:11,965
I need information
about this bet.

1082
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,936
I wanna ruin their
lives, alright?

1083
00:45:13,972 --> 00:45:14,704
I hate Denton.

1084
00:45:14,742 --> 00:45:16,542
-I hate him, too.
-Good, good!

1085
00:45:16,577 --> 00:45:18,980
Maybe there's a way we
both get what we want.

1086
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:21,619
Two blowjobs.

1087
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:24,089
He's touching my dick.

1088
00:45:24,126 --> 00:45:24,891
Here's the deal.

1089
00:45:24,929 --> 00:45:26,964
I need information
about this bet.

1090
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,137
Every time you find something
out, you give me a call.

1091
00:45:30,173 --> 00:45:32,541
I give you cash.

1092
00:45:37,621 --> 00:45:41,726
I present to you
Sarah Dawn Samuels.

1093
00:45:46,806 --> 00:45:49,910
What is
she doing here?

1094
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,215
Well auditioning for
reality TV all day,

1095
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:54,721
only time she has to
work out is at night.

1096
00:45:56,827 --> 00:45:58,630
During my shift.

1097
00:46:00,769 --> 00:46:02,871
I'm her personal
trainer so to speak.

1098
00:46:02,907 --> 00:46:04,875
We've spent some
time together.

1099
00:46:04,911 --> 00:46:07,179
Through all that bonding,
I've learned her deepest

1100
00:46:07,215 --> 00:46:09,617
desires and
darkest secrets.

1101
00:46:09,653 --> 00:46:15,463
Her scent is that of a rose
garden after a midsummer's rain.

1102
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,434
She's a siren
in the water.

1103
00:46:17,471 --> 00:46:20,673
She calls to me and only
I hold the key to her

1104
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,811
soul's relaxation.

1105
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:30,193
It pains me to betray my
lady, but it's for the

1106
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:32,097
good of the bet.

1107
00:46:32,134 --> 00:46:35,538
I hold in my hand her
one Achilles' heel.

1108
00:46:35,574 --> 00:46:38,211
Or should I say,
Achilles' crotch.

1109
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,150
That's a serious
pre-op moose knuckle.

1110
00:46:42,188 --> 00:46:44,523
It looks like six
dollar burger.

1111
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:46,260
If it ever gets
out, she's ruined.

1112
00:46:46,297 --> 00:46:47,697
Really, Jackson?

1113
00:46:47,733 --> 00:46:49,233
We're resorting
to blackmail now.

1114
00:46:49,269 --> 00:46:51,637
Yeah, super. Now we're
sexual predators.

1115
00:46:51,672 --> 00:46:52,972
Sexual predators?

1116
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,677
What are we just walking
the streets looking for

1117
00:46:54,713 --> 00:46:57,750
houses for teddy bears in
the window to wander into?

1118
00:46:57,786 --> 00:46:59,688
Not in my wildest dreams.

1119
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:02,227
Sorry, baby.

1120
00:47:05,204 --> 00:47:06,637
Jackson, just give me...

1121
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:09,041
-Stop, stop it!
-Hi, Sarah.

1122
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:11,079
Stop it!

1123
00:47:11,115 --> 00:47:12,648
Jackson!

1124
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:02,274
Hi, Denton.

1125
00:49:11,931 --> 00:49:14,032
Hey, dad. What are you
doing up so early?

1126
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:16,103
No time for sleep.

1127
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:18,909
Your stepmother
is getting close.

1128
00:49:19,646 --> 00:49:21,680
Yeah, she's...

1129
00:49:21,717 --> 00:49:22,817
She's looking sharp.

1130
00:49:22,853 --> 00:49:24,152
You know, actually
grab a seat.

1131
00:49:24,188 --> 00:49:26,190
I've been meaning
to talk to you.

1132
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:30,032
Is everything okay?

1133
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:31,368
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1134
00:49:31,405 --> 00:49:32,771
I'm fine.

1135
00:49:34,043 --> 00:49:37,213
So you and second grade...

1136
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,282
Amanda Morrison.

1137
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:40,788
Yeah, Amanda.

1138
00:49:40,824 --> 00:49:42,893
You guys are spending a lot
of time together this summer.

1139
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:47,835
Yeah, she's
she's really great.

1140
00:49:47,871 --> 00:49:49,839
You think she'd be okay
with this whole bet thing

1141
00:49:49,876 --> 00:49:51,911
you got going on?

1142
00:49:56,724 --> 00:49:58,356
What the hell do I know?

1143
00:49:58,393 --> 00:50:01,697
A guy making a woman
out of plastic, right?

1144
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:03,099
Give me the glue,
will you?

1145
00:50:08,981 --> 00:50:09,980
Planet of the Apes.

1146
00:50:10,016 --> 00:50:11,416
No. No, no, no.

1147
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:15,291
Planet of the Apes
with Marky Mark?

1148
00:50:15,329 --> 00:50:18,066
God, God, no!

1149
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,179
Sloth from the Goonies!

1150
00:50:25,215 --> 00:50:26,782
No, no!

1151
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:27,717
I'm Harry.

1152
00:50:27,755 --> 00:50:29,956
I'm Harry from Harry
and the Hendersons.

1153
00:50:29,992 --> 00:50:31,425
I've never seen it.

1154
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:32,394
You're kidding me.

1155
00:50:32,431 --> 00:50:33,864
You've never seen Harry
and the Hendersons?

1156
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,766
No.

1157
00:50:34,802 --> 00:50:37,338
God, that was on my
favorite VHS tape.

1158
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:38,541
What are you
talking about?

1159
00:50:38,576 --> 00:50:39,608
Yeah, no. Okay...

1160
00:50:39,646 --> 00:50:42,081
When I was growing up, my
dad he made us this VHS

1161
00:50:42,117 --> 00:50:44,085
tape that had like
six movies on it.

1162
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:46,256
It was made in that super
poor person's speed.

1163
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,959
I guess you
weren't poor, okay.

1164
00:50:47,996 --> 00:50:51,032
Well it had Blackstar
Fighter, Flight of Dragons,

1165
00:50:51,068 --> 00:50:55,807
Beast Master, Monster Squad,
and Harry and the Hendersons.

1166
00:50:59,117 --> 00:51:01,253
Hey look...

1167
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,293
I've been thinking.

1168
00:51:03,327 --> 00:51:07,097
Summer's almost over and
I've had a really great

1169
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,171
time hanging out with you.

1170
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:15,246
I know that we are just
friends, but what if we...

1171
00:51:15,284 --> 00:51:16,250
We went?

1172
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:17,455
-What if you and I...
-What if you and I...

1173
00:51:17,489 --> 00:51:19,257
-Went out?
-If you wanted...

1174
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:21,996
What if you and I went...

1175
00:51:22,032 --> 00:51:23,031
On a date?

1176
00:51:23,068 --> 00:51:23,766
Are you?

1177
00:51:23,804 --> 00:51:25,171
You are, you're
asking me out.

1178
00:51:25,206 --> 00:51:26,539
Are you asking me
out on a proper date?

1179
00:51:26,577 --> 00:51:28,812
What if I was?

1180
00:51:28,847 --> 00:51:31,315
I'd really have to
do the maths on that.

1181
00:51:31,351 --> 00:51:32,786
I don't know.

1182
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:34,154
Probably think about it.

1183
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:36,927
Quite frankly, I'm
not attracted to you.

1184
00:51:36,963 --> 00:51:38,898
It would be me
doing you a favor.

1185
00:51:40,101 --> 00:51:40,866
Really?

1186
00:51:40,903 --> 00:51:41,668
You know, were you
in a grease fire

1187
00:51:41,706 --> 00:51:42,940
or something because
your face...

1188
00:51:47,619 --> 00:51:49,854
Maybe I can change your mind.

1189
00:51:50,992 --> 00:51:52,993
Denton!

1190
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:54,931
Where have you been?

1191
00:51:54,967 --> 00:51:56,600
Grab me some cans of beer
and a handful of those

1192
00:51:56,637 --> 00:51:59,039
grapes and let's get
the hell out of here.

1193
00:51:59,077 --> 00:52:00,110
It's cool.

1194
00:52:00,144 --> 00:52:03,047
We can pick up where we
left off later on tonight.

1195
00:52:03,485 --> 00:52:06,455
-Tonight?
-Yeah!

1196
00:52:06,492 --> 00:52:08,327
On our first
official date.

1197
00:52:09,264 --> 00:52:11,333
Where?

1198
00:52:11,367 --> 00:52:13,034
It's a surprise.

1199
00:52:14,141 --> 00:52:16,576
Just pick me up here
later after work.

1200
00:52:16,612 --> 00:52:17,611
Okay.

1201
00:52:26,264 --> 00:52:27,262
Well thanks a lot, man.

1202
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,533
I was just about
to kiss her.

1203
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,170
You haven't hooked
up with her yet?

1204
00:52:30,206 --> 00:52:32,342
You've seen her fifty
times this summer.

1205
00:52:33,246 --> 00:52:35,213
You're gonna fuck this up.

1206
00:52:35,251 --> 00:52:37,219
How? What are you
talking about?

1207
00:52:37,255 --> 00:52:39,456
You're in love with her.

1208
00:52:39,492 --> 00:52:40,492
I am...

1209
00:52:40,527 --> 00:52:42,361
That is not...

1210
00:52:42,398 --> 00:52:46,069
How would one know though
if they were in love?

1211
00:52:47,076 --> 00:52:48,307
Close your eyes.

1212
00:52:48,344 --> 00:52:49,978
Okay.

1213
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:53,618
-Imagine yourself fucking her.
-Okay.

1214
00:52:53,655 --> 00:52:57,126
Her pants are around her ankles,
she's bent over the bed.

1215
00:52:57,163 --> 00:52:59,632
It's really hot, her
hair's kinda tussled.

1216
00:52:59,668 --> 00:53:01,402
You just blew a load
right inside her.

1217
00:53:01,436 --> 00:53:02,469
-Epic.
-Okay. Alright.

1218
00:53:02,507 --> 00:53:04,307
I mean, you've
stained her soul.

1219
00:53:04,344 --> 00:53:06,379
What do you wanna do next?

1220
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:09,618
I kinda just wanna cuddle.

1221
00:53:09,655 --> 00:53:11,289
Fuck.

1222
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,095
How are you supposed to
focus, man, when you're

1223
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:16,565
all fucking puppy dogs
and ice cream upstairs?

1224
00:53:16,601 --> 00:53:18,369
Where are we going even?

1225
00:53:19,141 --> 00:53:19,872
Hey, guys.

1226
00:53:19,909 --> 00:53:22,444
This fucking
guy's gonna do it.

1227
00:53:22,481 --> 00:53:25,451
He has eight or nine fucking
bitches there already.

1228
00:53:25,487 --> 00:53:26,520
Yeah, I'm telling you.

1229
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:29,693
The guy has a cock like a
fucking gold cock, man.

1230
00:53:29,728 --> 00:53:31,663
That's very
unfortunate news, Bob!

1231
00:53:31,699 --> 00:53:33,233
It's like a fucking
broken fire hydrant.

1232
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:34,269
You should see
the kid spraying.

1233
00:53:34,304 --> 00:53:36,672
This is fucking
jizz fucking city.

1234
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:39,280
And one of these fucking
children, the mother came...

1235
00:53:39,315 --> 00:53:41,283
She slipped on the jizz.

1236
00:53:42,722 --> 00:53:46,161
You okay? Because if you're
not okay, I'm not okay.

1237
00:53:46,197 --> 00:53:48,431
He's doing much better
than I thought he would.

1238
00:53:48,467 --> 00:53:51,505
I can't lose this bit
to that lanky fuck.

1239
00:53:52,143 --> 00:53:55,180
We gotta get serious,
real serious.

1240
00:53:55,215 --> 00:53:57,616
Operation Derailment Serious.

1241
00:53:57,655 --> 00:53:59,457
Denise!

1242
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,593
Sit down.

1243
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,339
You nervous?

1244
00:54:08,376 --> 00:54:09,409
No.

1245
00:54:09,443 --> 00:54:10,643
-You look nervous.
-Nope.

1246
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:11,511
She look nervous to you?

1247
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,014
Definitely looks nervous.

1248
00:54:13,052 --> 00:54:14,385
I'm not nervous.

1249
00:54:15,356 --> 00:54:16,456
I'm gonna cut
to the chase.

1250
00:54:16,492 --> 00:54:18,227
We know you know
about the bet.

1251
00:54:18,264 --> 00:54:19,163
We know you're
one of the girls.

1252
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:20,464
And we know you blew
Denton in the lobby.

1253
00:54:20,501 --> 00:54:21,701
There's a video.
Serge here has seen it.

1254
00:54:21,737 --> 00:54:24,204
Yeah, it was a
sweet fucking BJ.

1255
00:54:24,242 --> 00:54:25,442
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1256
00:54:25,478 --> 00:54:27,413
Here's what you
need to do for me.

1257
00:54:28,784 --> 00:54:30,685
Help me win the bit.

1258
00:54:30,722 --> 00:54:32,356
How do I help
you win the bit?

1259
00:54:32,393 --> 00:54:34,060
I can't unblow him.

1260
00:54:36,134 --> 00:54:37,400
Well you're a crazy
super stalker, right?

1261
00:54:37,438 --> 00:54:38,671
You got his
passwords and shit.

1262
00:54:38,706 --> 00:54:40,707
Just his social media
info, email accounts,

1263
00:54:40,742 --> 00:54:42,644
social security number,
home phone, home address,

1264
00:54:42,681 --> 00:54:43,612
parent's phone,
parent's address.

1265
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:44,748
I'm gonna stop
you right there.

1266
00:54:44,786 --> 00:54:46,787
We actually just need
you to log into one of his

1267
00:54:46,822 --> 00:54:49,257
email accounts and send an
email to Amanda Morrison.

1268
00:54:49,293 --> 00:54:50,226
Alright?
Pretend to be Denton.

1269
00:54:50,262 --> 00:54:52,030
Say it's an emergency.
I don't give a fuck.

1270
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:53,266
However you do it.

1271
00:54:53,302 --> 00:54:56,204
Get her over to that garage
battle station that they have.

1272
00:54:56,239 --> 00:54:58,608
When she sees what he's
really up to, she's never

1273
00:54:58,646 --> 00:55:00,079
gonna talk to him again.

1274
00:55:00,115 --> 00:55:02,050
Let alone fuck
him, am I right?

1275
00:55:02,086 --> 00:55:03,420
And then we got
this in the bag.

1276
00:55:03,456 --> 00:55:06,292
Paper or plastic!

1277
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:09,566
Or bring your own bag and save
the environment or something.

1278
00:55:09,603 --> 00:55:10,802
He's just such a good guy.

1279
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:14,108
I don't feel comfortable like
messing up his whole thing.

1280
00:55:14,146 --> 00:55:15,713
That's so cute she
thinks she has a choice.

1281
00:55:15,748 --> 00:55:17,414
You're gonna feel
comfortable with it or

1282
00:55:17,452 --> 00:55:18,652
you're gonna be fired.

1283
00:55:22,563 --> 00:55:23,463
Go now psycho.

1284
00:55:23,498 --> 00:55:24,530
What are you doing?

1285
00:55:24,565 --> 00:55:26,032
Do my bidding.

1286
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,303
What are you doing?

1287
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:29,306
Just get the
fuck out of here.

1288
00:55:29,344 --> 00:55:30,777
-Okay!
-Get the fuck out of here.

1289
00:55:30,813 --> 00:55:32,547
-You just had to say that.
-Go!

1290
00:55:33,585 --> 00:55:36,155
I don't understand
you two.

1291
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,425
Yo, did you
watch that tape?

1292
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:39,429
Yeah.

1293
00:55:39,465 --> 00:55:40,631
Crazy ones can really
suck a dick, am I right?

1294
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:43,436
I know, I'm going to the psych
ward for my next blowjob.

1295
00:55:55,864 --> 00:55:57,164
Well this is the place.

1296
00:55:57,199 --> 00:55:59,802
Looks like a
fucking shithole.

1297
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,376
Wait, Kendra lives here?

1298
00:56:02,411 --> 00:56:05,014
Yeah, and she thinks
you're a doctor.

1299
00:56:05,485 --> 00:56:07,553
So you're gonna
want to suit up.

1300
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:09,657
I'm getting a disease just
looking at this place.

1301
00:56:09,693 --> 00:56:11,260
Are you packing jimmies?

1302
00:56:11,762 --> 00:56:12,628
No.

1303
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:14,568
That's okay. I got
plenty in the glove.

1304
00:56:17,376 --> 00:56:20,112
Wait a minute, why do you
have a water pistol in your...

1305
00:56:20,148 --> 00:56:22,350
That's not an
ordinary water pistol.

1306
00:56:22,385 --> 00:56:23,686
It's filled
with your seed.

1307
00:56:24,925 --> 00:56:27,461
Why do you have a water pistol
filled with my seed in here?

1308
00:56:27,496 --> 00:56:30,366
Well, you know that
place you donate sperm?

1309
00:56:30,402 --> 00:56:31,368
Yeah?

1310
00:56:31,405 --> 00:56:32,371
Well yeah, I snuck in in
the middle of the night

1311
00:56:32,407 --> 00:56:34,275
and grabbed a bunch of
your cum and filled up

1312
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:35,844
this water pistol here.

1313
00:56:37,248 --> 00:56:38,281
Why?

1314
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:41,523
Well, you know, just in
case there was some chicks

1315
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:42,390
you couldn't pull down.

1316
00:56:42,427 --> 00:56:43,460
It's a contingency plan.

1317
00:56:43,496 --> 00:56:44,362
Okay. You know what?

1318
00:56:44,398 --> 00:56:45,063
Just give me that back.

1319
00:56:45,099 --> 00:56:46,266
-It's my cum.
-I need it.

1320
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:47,668
You know what?
I got money...

1321
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:48,737
-This is important?
-Can I have my...

1322
00:56:48,775 --> 00:56:50,809
Give me my cum back!

1323
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,153
-Geez.
-Sorry.

1324
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:59,427
You know, I always knew
you'd be successful.

1325
00:57:00,532 --> 00:57:03,202
I have great
intuition with men.

1326
00:57:04,306 --> 00:57:06,307
Except for the
ones that I marry.

1327
00:57:09,516 --> 00:57:11,115
You got a little
one, do you?

1328
00:57:13,324 --> 00:57:14,390
-Seven.
-No shit.

1329
00:57:14,427 --> 00:57:15,794
Four boys, three girls.

1330
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:18,164
But they're with their
respected fathers tonight.

1331
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:21,539
I thought that it'd be
nice to give us a little

1332
00:57:21,576 --> 00:57:24,679
privacy since you were so kind
to take a house call, doctor.

1333
00:57:24,715 --> 00:57:25,480
Doctor...

1334
00:57:25,516 --> 00:57:26,616
Mhm.

1335
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,519
Is so formal.

1336
00:57:28,556 --> 00:57:29,822
You know, just
call me Denton.

1337
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,693
Just regular old
Denton will do.

1338
00:57:31,728 --> 00:57:35,699
So what seems to
be the situation?

1339
00:57:35,737 --> 00:57:36,703
Yeah.

1340
00:57:36,739 --> 00:57:37,638
My wrist.

1341
00:57:37,675 --> 00:57:39,876
It's like really been
giving me trouble.

1342
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,615
- It really hurts to...
- Take a look.

1343
00:57:41,648 --> 00:57:42,514
Think it could be?

1344
00:57:43,989 --> 00:57:45,389
Do you think
you could help?

1345
00:57:45,423 --> 00:57:46,922
I do, I do....

1346
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,362
Let's have a...

1347
00:57:49,398 --> 00:57:52,302
listen to the old ticker.

1348
00:57:55,378 --> 00:57:57,346
Yeah, yes.

1349
00:57:57,382 --> 00:57:58,682
Yeah.

1350
00:57:59,753 --> 00:58:00,619
I've heard this before.

1351
00:58:00,657 --> 00:58:02,992
I'm afraid you have
poor circulation.

1352
00:58:03,027 --> 00:58:04,827
And I think you could
be in immediate danger.

1353
00:58:04,865 --> 00:58:05,898
My!
What should we do?

1354
00:58:05,934 --> 00:58:07,936
Well I think we should
probably start by getting

1355
00:58:07,971 --> 00:58:10,373
you out of that tight,
restrictive top.

1356
00:58:10,409 --> 00:58:12,844
Yeah, maybe even those
tight, tight, tight pants.

1357
00:58:12,882 --> 00:58:14,717
Are you sure?

1358
00:58:14,751 --> 00:58:16,452
Yes, very sure.
Very sure.

1359
00:58:16,487 --> 00:58:20,759
It's the first thing we
learn in doctor school.

1360
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:22,798
That must
have been so hard.

1361
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:23,933
It was.

1362
00:58:23,969 --> 00:58:25,068
Yes, it certainly was.

1363
00:58:25,106 --> 00:58:30,280
But when you see the look
of pure laughter on a baby

1364
00:58:30,317 --> 00:58:33,420
child's face after
a successful brain

1365
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:35,860
appointment it makes
everything worth it.

1366
00:58:35,896 --> 00:58:37,730
You know that you're
doing the lord's work.

1367
00:58:37,766 --> 00:58:39,968
These hands, I'll tell you,
they've seen some stories.

1368
00:58:56,503 --> 00:58:57,670
Denton!

1369
00:58:58,809 --> 00:59:01,012
Denton, it's me!

1370
00:59:01,047 --> 00:59:02,380
Amanda?

1371
00:59:02,416 --> 00:59:03,849
Denton, I got here
as fast as I could.

1372
00:59:03,885 --> 00:59:05,753
Is your dad okay?

1373
00:59:07,525 --> 00:59:08,591
Mr. B, Mr. B, Mr. B!

1374
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,631
-Wake up, wake up, wake up!
-Damn you, Phil Collins!

1375
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:12,501
Amanda Morrison is here.

1376
00:59:12,536 --> 00:59:14,270
-Who?
-Second grade!

1377
00:59:14,307 --> 00:59:15,875
Denton, are you in there?

1378
00:59:15,911 --> 00:59:18,378
No, no!

1379
00:59:18,414 --> 00:59:20,550
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

1380
00:59:20,588 --> 00:59:21,286
One second.

1381
00:59:21,322 --> 00:59:22,589
I gotta put my
pants back on.

1382
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,559
Me too, me too.

1383
00:59:28,036 --> 00:59:29,804
Denton, are you home?

1384
00:59:40,061 --> 00:59:41,996
What the hell is this?

1385
00:59:47,009 --> 00:59:49,311
Fuck me, Scott.

1386
00:59:49,347 --> 00:59:51,081
No, I'm Denton.

1387
00:59:51,117 --> 00:59:54,421
No, no, Scott's my fiancé.

1388
00:59:54,456 --> 00:59:55,455
Did you just finish?

1389
00:59:55,492 --> 00:59:56,726
No, I don't...

1390
00:59:56,762 --> 00:59:58,864
Wait, you have a fiancé?

1391
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,000
Of course you
have a fiancé.

1392
01:00:00,036 --> 01:00:01,503
Kendra, I'm home.

1393
01:00:01,539 --> 01:00:02,705
Give me a beer.

1394
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:05,777
Make sure it's cold as shit from
that new fridge, you know?

1395
01:00:06,983 --> 01:00:08,516
Hey, Denton!

1396
01:00:08,552 --> 01:00:09,718
What ya doing here, boy?

1397
01:00:09,755 --> 01:00:11,556
It's great to see you.

1398
01:00:11,592 --> 01:00:14,061
Wait a minute, you're not
here for them movies, is ya?

1399
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:16,100
Because you know, I really
do need a little more time

1400
01:00:16,135 --> 01:00:19,072
on those, you
know, but...

1401
01:00:19,108 --> 01:00:23,380
Wait a minute, why
is she in her undies?

1402
01:00:24,152 --> 01:00:27,956
And why does grandpa
have a chubbie?

1403
01:00:29,831 --> 01:00:31,064
Bing!

1404
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:32,099
Grandpa!

1405
01:00:32,135 --> 01:00:34,570
Did my woman suck
this man's cock?

1406
01:00:34,608 --> 01:00:35,539
No.

1407
01:00:35,577 --> 01:00:36,944
Sucked it real good.

1408
01:00:36,978 --> 01:00:38,077
-You!
-You seen it?

1409
01:00:38,114 --> 01:00:40,449
Licked his
pooper hole, too.

1410
01:00:40,485 --> 01:00:41,618
His butthole.

1411
01:00:41,655 --> 01:00:42,353
No, Scott.

1412
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,858
My butthole is
unlicked today.

1413
01:00:44,894 --> 01:00:47,597
You little adulterer,
coming into my beautiful home,

1414
01:00:47,632 --> 01:00:50,535
making my angel eat
at your gas station.

1415
01:00:50,572 --> 01:00:52,607
I got some bad, bad
news for you, boy.

1416
01:00:52,643 --> 01:00:55,479
Your timing's all sorts of
shit because I'm back on

1417
01:00:55,516 --> 01:00:56,715
the juice, motherfucker.

1418
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:57,818
I'm sorry, doc.

1419
01:00:57,855 --> 01:00:59,021
He's gonna fuck you up.

1420
01:00:59,057 --> 01:01:00,625
-Yeah, that's right.
-Scott, Scott!

1421
01:01:00,661 --> 01:01:02,562
Just calm down
for just a second.

1422
01:01:02,597 --> 01:01:03,496
Yeah, yeah.

1423
01:01:03,532 --> 01:01:04,632
What you got,
what you got?

1424
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,003
Fuck that shit, boy.

1425
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:07,038
Come on, bring it on.

1426
01:01:07,074 --> 01:01:08,641
Come on, dog.

1427
01:01:09,612 --> 01:01:11,815
Cool your motherfucking
jets, Scott.

1428
01:01:11,851 --> 01:01:12,983
What are you gonna do?

1429
01:01:13,018 --> 01:01:14,685
Shoot me with a water gun?

1430
01:01:14,724 --> 01:01:16,592
Do not make me
pull this trigger.

1431
01:01:16,628 --> 01:01:17,561
Go time!

1432
01:01:40,543 --> 01:01:42,009
Wiggins! Dad!

1433
01:01:42,045 --> 01:01:43,011
You're not gonna
believe this.

1434
01:01:43,047 --> 01:01:45,082
I just hooked up with
Kendra and I shot a load

1435
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,085
into Scott's mouth.

1436
01:01:46,121 --> 01:01:46,987
What?

1437
01:01:47,023 --> 01:01:48,222
Well not technically
I didn't shoot...

1438
01:01:48,259 --> 01:01:49,893
No, no, no,
technically I did.

1439
01:01:49,929 --> 01:01:50,661
It doesn't matter!

1440
01:01:50,697 --> 01:01:51,730
The point is...

1441
01:01:51,768 --> 01:01:54,670
I'm about to win
this fucking...

1442
01:01:54,706 --> 01:01:56,541
Bet?

1443
01:01:57,143 --> 01:01:58,676
I'm part of a bet?

1444
01:01:58,713 --> 01:02:00,246
Look, look, look...

1445
01:02:00,284 --> 01:02:02,786
- I can explain.
- You can explain?

1446
01:02:02,822 --> 01:02:05,659
I don't think that
needs explanation.

1447
01:02:05,695 --> 01:02:07,094
This is disgusting.

1448
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:08,498
Are you kidding right now?

1449
01:02:08,534 --> 01:02:10,000
Don't touch me!

1450
01:02:10,036 --> 01:02:12,004
I am so freaked
out right now.

1451
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:14,177
I never want to
see you again.

1452
01:02:14,211 --> 01:02:15,679
Don't say that.
Amanda, please...

1453
01:02:15,717 --> 01:02:16,983
Don't.

1454
01:02:25,068 --> 01:02:26,770
Who are you?

1455
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:35,219
Yeah, man...
Who are you?

1456
01:02:47,315 --> 01:02:49,115
Heard the big news.

1457
01:02:49,152 --> 01:02:50,617
You fucked it all up.

1458
01:02:50,655 --> 01:02:52,723
I gotta admit, for a
second there you had me

1459
01:02:52,759 --> 01:02:53,958
genuinely concerned.

1460
01:02:53,994 --> 01:02:55,161
Nine girls, one guy.

1461
01:02:55,197 --> 01:02:56,297
Not bad.

1462
01:02:56,335 --> 01:02:58,036
I tip my dick to you, sir.

1463
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:02,308
You actually came here
just to be a dick to me?

1464
01:03:02,347 --> 01:03:03,846
Listen to me, you
quivering pussy.

1465
01:03:03,882 --> 01:03:05,784
This bet was your shot.

1466
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:07,721
I gave it to you on a
silver fucking platter.

1467
01:03:07,755 --> 01:03:10,925
But you, as you do, kept
up the family tradition.

1468
01:03:10,963 --> 01:03:11,996
Failure.

1469
01:03:12,032 --> 01:03:14,000
So I think my family can't
take anything else from

1470
01:03:14,036 --> 01:03:15,135
your family.

1471
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:17,005
My dad takes your
dad's company.

1472
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:19,877
I take this shithole you
call a video store, and

1473
01:03:19,914 --> 01:03:22,217
then tomorrow when you
lose that bet, I'm gonna

1474
01:03:22,253 --> 01:03:23,885
make you and
daddy homeless.

1475
01:03:23,922 --> 01:03:24,955
You know why?

1476
01:03:24,992 --> 01:03:27,929
Cause you and all your
little friends, you're all

1477
01:03:27,965 --> 01:03:29,766
a bunch of
fucking weirdos.

1478
01:03:29,802 --> 01:03:32,772
I win, you lose.

1479
01:03:32,807 --> 01:03:34,240
Suck my dick.

1480
01:03:38,153 --> 01:03:39,119
See you at the
game tomorrow.

1481
01:03:39,155 --> 01:03:40,588
You can sick my dick.

1482
01:03:44,164 --> 01:03:46,632
...watching anime porn
and I catch the dude...

1483
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:48,103
What the fuck are
you doing, man?

1484
01:03:48,139 --> 01:03:49,306
What's it look like
I'm doing, Jackson?

1485
01:03:49,342 --> 01:03:51,077
Okay, dude, chill. Clearly you
just need to talk about...

1486
01:03:51,112 --> 01:03:52,612
Talk about what, Ed?

1487
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:54,250
How you two
ruined my life?

1488
01:03:54,286 --> 01:03:56,086
Dude, you were this close
to winning the bet.

1489
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:57,891
Don't you dare
back out now.

1490
01:03:57,927 --> 01:03:59,093
I don't fucking
care about the bet.

1491
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:00,028
I don't care
about the bet.

1492
01:04:00,067 --> 01:04:02,300
I've lost the only
person I wanna be with.

1493
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,043
-Scott Quaker.
-God...

1494
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:08,012
It's not, I didn't...

1495
01:04:08,047 --> 01:04:09,680
God damnit!

1496
01:04:10,788 --> 01:04:12,320
What? She'll understand, right?

1497
01:04:12,356 --> 01:04:13,824
We'll just go by her
house, explain the

1498
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:15,626
situation she'll get it.

1499
01:04:15,663 --> 01:04:17,364
She'll understand what, Ed?
That she was right?

1500
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,204
She's part of some stupid bet
that my friends got me into.

1501
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:23,610
I cannot believe I let you
guys convince me to do this.

1502
01:04:26,418 --> 01:04:27,885
Fuck you.

1503
01:04:27,922 --> 01:04:29,021
Fuck me?

1504
01:04:29,057 --> 01:04:33,027
Dude, you sit here all day
bitching and moaning about

1505
01:04:33,065 --> 01:04:35,300
your life and things
that happen to you.

1506
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,073
Be it girls, or your job.

1507
01:04:37,108 --> 01:04:38,641
Man, fuck, even us!

1508
01:04:38,677 --> 01:04:40,778
And when shit doesn't go
your way, you go on the

1509
01:04:40,815 --> 01:04:43,952
fucking rag and just bitch about
how shit Denton's life is.

1510
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:45,255
Back me up on
this, Wiggins.

1511
01:04:45,293 --> 01:04:46,057
I still wet the bed.

1512
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:47,929
I can't really talk.

1513
01:04:47,963 --> 01:04:49,096
God damn shame.

1514
01:04:49,132 --> 01:04:50,098
Are you kidding me?

1515
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:51,871
How shit my life is?

1516
01:04:51,905 --> 01:04:54,173
Jackson, when's the last time
you hooked up with a chick?

1517
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:54,974
What was it years?

1518
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:56,143
And by the way,
your shakes suck.

1519
01:04:56,179 --> 01:04:57,212
And you, Ed?

1520
01:04:57,248 --> 01:04:59,449
You are so full of shit.

1521
01:04:59,485 --> 01:05:01,688
You're this love guru,
but except the only girl

1522
01:05:01,724 --> 01:05:03,860
you've ever been
with you married.

1523
01:05:03,896 --> 01:05:06,865
You two have been living
vicariously through me,

1524
01:05:06,902 --> 01:05:09,137
but it's not you who
has the shit life.

1525
01:05:09,173 --> 01:05:10,606
It's me!

1526
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:13,113
Get out.
Just get out of here.

1527
01:05:13,148 --> 01:05:14,148
All of you.

1528
01:05:14,184 --> 01:05:16,052
And take this
trash with you.

1529
01:05:21,699 --> 01:05:22,431
Come on, Wiggins.

1530
01:05:22,469 --> 01:05:23,867
Wiggins, get out here.

1531
01:05:23,903 --> 01:05:25,271
-Get the fuck out!
-Wiggins!

1532
01:05:25,309 --> 01:05:27,344
Wiggins, get the
fuck out of here!

1533
01:05:27,378 --> 01:05:28,444
You've upset Wiggins.

1534
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:29,814
Wiggins, go.

1535
01:05:29,851 --> 01:05:31,952
He's a fucking mess.

1536
01:05:31,987 --> 01:05:32,953
I'll leave you one.

1537
01:05:32,989 --> 01:05:33,888
I'll leave you one.

1538
01:05:33,925 --> 01:05:34,690
Go!

1539
01:05:34,726 --> 01:05:36,693
Wiggins is my friend now.
He's...

1540
01:05:36,731 --> 01:05:38,365
Get out, get out!

1541
01:05:48,989 --> 01:05:50,155
D-dad.

1542
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:52,292
Not you, you
don't have to go.

1543
01:05:54,266 --> 01:05:58,170
I refuse to let the lovely
Legos lose her virginity

1544
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:00,411
in this den of sadness.

1545
01:06:00,447 --> 01:06:03,350
You need to be alone
right now anyway, son.

1546
01:06:03,385 --> 01:06:05,820
You got a lot
to think about.

1547
01:07:33,003 --> 01:07:33,869
Your dad's coming.

1548
01:07:33,905 --> 01:07:35,105
Yeah.

1549
01:07:35,141 --> 01:07:37,778
How'd it go
with lady Lego?

1550
01:07:38,983 --> 01:07:40,350
It was horrible.

1551
01:07:40,385 --> 01:07:42,519
We all went to the
field last night.

1552
01:07:42,557 --> 01:07:45,195
He got butt naked and made
us all gather around her

1553
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:47,865
as he mounted her right
over there on home plate.

1554
01:07:47,902 --> 01:07:51,539
On first thrust, she
exploded into a million pieces.

1555
01:07:51,576 --> 01:07:56,315
He just sat there defeated as
his bruised old boner went limp.

1556
01:07:56,353 --> 01:07:58,855
Saddest shit
I've ever seen.

1557
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:01,027
Well, well, well...

1558
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:03,230
Look at these
video fun fucks.

1559
01:08:03,266 --> 01:08:04,299
You guys excited?

1560
01:08:04,336 --> 01:08:07,539
You like the smell of the
field, the cut grass,

1561
01:08:07,576 --> 01:08:10,278
the stands full of quivering
lady pussies waiting

1562
01:08:10,315 --> 01:08:13,184
for the B dog to
satisfy them??

1563
01:08:13,221 --> 01:08:15,957
God, I wanted to see you
guys lose, but to see you

1564
01:08:15,993 --> 01:08:18,362
lose in front of a packed house,
life is fucking sweet.

1565
01:08:18,398 --> 01:08:20,565
Like brown sugar
on white pussy.

1566
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:23,974
Hey look, y'all, President
and CEO of Goldman Nutsucks.

1567
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:26,177
Sorry, guys, I don't
speak poor person.

1568
01:08:26,216 --> 01:08:27,248
Mary Kate.

1569
01:08:27,283 --> 01:08:28,516
Ashley.

1570
01:08:28,552 --> 01:08:30,119
You ladies eighteen yet?

1571
01:08:30,155 --> 01:08:31,957
Jackson, I know you're
gonna miss this most so

1572
01:08:31,993 --> 01:08:34,228
really try and
enjoy it, okay?

1573
01:08:34,262 --> 01:08:35,896
Good luck out
there, ladies.

1574
01:08:42,448 --> 01:08:44,115
He almost hit that truck.

1575
01:08:54,273 --> 01:08:55,672
Gentlemen.

1576
01:08:55,707 --> 01:09:00,414
It's been an honor serving
with you on that battlefield.

1577
01:09:00,453 --> 01:09:06,195
You fought like warrior
poets in the days of old,

1578
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:13,242
but I ask you one last
time to fight with me.

1579
01:09:13,278 --> 01:09:14,511
Can you do that?

1580
01:09:14,546 --> 01:09:17,516
Fight with me!

1581
01:09:20,658 --> 01:09:22,893
Spit on me.

1582
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:24,430
I got some in my mouth.

1583
01:09:24,466 --> 01:09:27,269
Thanks for coming out, folks,
to the last game of the season.

1584
01:09:27,307 --> 01:09:29,409
It's gonna be a doozey.

1585
01:09:29,444 --> 01:09:32,581
Now batting, Jackson Price.

1586
01:09:34,655 --> 01:09:35,988
What's in this?

1587
01:09:36,024 --> 01:09:37,692
Jackson's shake
masterpiece.

1588
01:09:37,729 --> 01:09:39,897
The final cuntdown.

1589
01:09:41,572 --> 01:09:43,072
That was a good pitch.

1590
01:09:43,106 --> 01:09:44,707
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

1591
01:09:44,743 --> 01:09:46,076
Yeah?

1592
01:09:46,112 --> 01:09:47,078
What is that?

1593
01:09:47,114 --> 01:09:48,213
Balls on chin.

1594
01:09:48,252 --> 01:09:50,486
Dude, I'm not in the mood
for jokes right now, man.

1595
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,190
Remember the tri-county
little league championships?

1596
01:09:53,228 --> 01:09:54,493
Yeah, yeah.
Who could forget?

1597
01:09:54,529 --> 01:09:57,132
You got hit in the face
twice in one game.

1598
01:09:57,167 --> 01:09:59,435
Taking those two balls
to the chin was the best

1599
01:09:59,472 --> 01:10:01,106
thing I ever did.

1600
01:10:01,143 --> 01:10:02,542
Why, what do you mean?

1601
01:10:02,581 --> 01:10:05,516
Everyone knew I wasn't
gonna get on base and if I

1602
01:10:05,551 --> 01:10:07,353
struck out, which I
was going to, the game

1603
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:09,024
would've been over, right?

1604
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:12,297
My only option to get on base
was to get hit by a pitch.

1605
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,167
Wait a minute, you
did that on purpose?

1606
01:10:14,204 --> 01:10:17,141
Yeah, I had to drink through
a straw for three months and

1607
01:10:17,177 --> 01:10:18,476
it was worth it.

1608
01:10:18,512 --> 01:10:20,547
We won because I didn't
accept the shitty hand of

1609
01:10:20,582 --> 01:10:22,216
cards that fate dealt me.

1610
01:10:22,253 --> 01:10:24,454
I took destiny
into my own hands.

1611
01:10:24,492 --> 01:10:26,694
Old man opportunity
knocked, the sixth grade

1612
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:31,036
version of myself answered
the door, and then I took

1613
01:10:31,072 --> 01:10:33,274
his two balls on my chin.

1614
01:10:37,085 --> 01:10:38,351
No, no! No, no, no!

1615
01:10:38,389 --> 01:10:39,255
Run, run.

1616
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:40,257
Where's your glove?

1617
01:10:40,292 --> 01:10:41,592
Where's your glove?

1618
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,230
Safe.

1619
01:10:46,805 --> 01:10:48,472
Good lead off, red.

1620
01:10:48,509 --> 01:10:51,846
Fuck all your mothers.

1621
01:10:51,882 --> 01:10:53,382
All of them.

1622
01:10:54,118 --> 01:10:55,318
You're up, D.

1623
01:10:56,157 --> 01:10:57,623
Let's light this bitch up.

1624
01:10:57,659 --> 01:10:59,260
On your games, boys.

1625
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:06,542
Now batting, Denton Baker.

1626
01:11:06,578 --> 01:11:08,380
Son of a bitch.

1627
01:11:08,716 --> 01:11:09,748
Dude, you suck.

1628
01:11:09,784 --> 01:11:11,487
Strike.

1629
01:11:12,224 --> 01:11:13,056
You know what, Lucas?

1630
01:11:13,092 --> 01:11:14,492
You want some esse?

1631
01:11:14,529 --> 01:11:16,297
According to this
contract, the bet's not

1632
01:11:16,332 --> 01:11:18,167
over til the end of
this season, right?

1633
01:11:18,203 --> 01:11:19,302
Yeah.

1634
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,740
Well there's still eight innings
left to win this thing.

1635
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:24,279
-Okay, okay.
-Hey, Jackson.

1636
01:11:24,315 --> 01:11:26,483
Game's not over, boys!

1637
01:11:28,324 --> 01:11:30,126
You're right.

1638
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,761
I have been a pussy.

1639
01:11:35,872 --> 01:11:39,410
I need you to
stall this game.

1640
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:46,090
Help!

1641
01:11:46,127 --> 01:11:48,896
My jockstrap is
twisted around my balls.

1642
01:11:48,932 --> 01:11:50,565
Come on.
Delay of game, blue!

1643
01:11:50,603 --> 01:11:53,373
You know, I wanted to wear
it like Maris did during

1644
01:11:53,408 --> 01:11:56,179
his 61 homerun season.

1645
01:11:56,215 --> 01:11:58,885
I read that he did that on
the back of his baseball card.

1646
01:11:58,921 --> 01:11:59,920
This is bullshit, Jackson.

1647
01:11:59,956 --> 01:12:02,358
I'm a bit of a
card collector.

1648
01:12:02,395 --> 01:12:03,528
Tops.

1649
01:12:03,564 --> 01:12:05,398
Hey, focus!
Don't look at him!

1650
01:12:05,435 --> 01:12:06,468
Look at me.

1651
01:12:06,502 --> 01:12:07,568
Don't look at me.

1652
01:12:07,605 --> 01:12:10,542
Fleer, Waxpacks.

1653
01:12:10,578 --> 01:12:11,577
Where you going?

1654
01:12:11,613 --> 01:12:13,748
To take a set of
balls on the chin.

1655
01:12:13,784 --> 01:12:15,418
What?

1656
01:12:15,889 --> 01:12:16,887
What, is he gay now?

1657
01:12:16,922 --> 01:12:18,590
No, no, it's a metaphor.

1658
01:12:18,627 --> 01:12:21,130
Honis Wagner of
the Honis Wanger card.

1659
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:22,399
Blue!

1660
01:12:22,436 --> 01:12:23,635
-Delay of game.
-Wayne Gretsky.

1661
01:12:23,671 --> 01:12:25,606
God!

1662
01:12:25,643 --> 01:12:28,279
It's like a
hangman's noose!

1663
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:50,591
And that was the Sneeches
by Dr. Seuss.

1664
01:12:51,662 --> 01:12:53,730
Do you guys know what the
moral of the story is?

1665
01:12:53,766 --> 01:12:57,271
The moral of the story is
that there was this one

1666
01:12:57,309 --> 01:12:59,244
boy sneech who
was confused.

1667
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:00,912
What are you doing?

1668
01:13:00,948 --> 01:13:06,925
There was this girl sneech who
was amazing and beautiful and

1669
01:13:06,961 --> 01:13:12,403
funny and confident in who she
is and he thought to himself.

1670
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,442
He thought, you know what?
You know what I need?

1671
01:13:14,476 --> 01:13:17,346
I need, I need, I need a
couple stars under my belt

1672
01:13:17,382 --> 01:13:18,949
to really impress
this girl.

1673
01:13:18,985 --> 01:13:21,487
The girl sneech.

1674
01:13:21,521 --> 01:13:23,724
So he goes over to his boys in
Whoville and he says to them...

1675
01:13:23,761 --> 01:13:24,961
They were like, you
know what, dude?

1676
01:13:24,997 --> 01:13:27,498
You need, you need
to be confident.

1677
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:29,872
You need to be like
the Cat in the Hat.

1678
01:13:29,907 --> 01:13:31,875
So he goes over and he
slams some beers with

1679
01:13:31,911 --> 01:13:34,914
Thing 1 and Thing 2, he
hits the town, he hooks up

1680
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,653
with a bunch of chicks.

1681
01:13:37,524 --> 01:13:40,594
That's not who he is.

1682
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:42,364
That's not what
he's about.

1683
01:13:43,436 --> 01:13:46,907
He's more like the
Lorax in reality.

1684
01:13:46,943 --> 01:13:50,014
Planting grickle grass,
and climbing truckular

1685
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:52,987
trees, and smoking cheese
with the Barbaluts.

1686
01:13:53,024 --> 01:13:54,859
What are you
trying to say?

1687
01:13:56,595 --> 01:13:59,633
Amanda, I fell in love
with you this summer.

1688
01:14:01,974 --> 01:14:05,679
I screwed it up.
I just screwed it up.

1689
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:09,854
But you need to know that
the man that I was when I

1690
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:13,429
was with you, that's
who I really am.

1691
01:14:14,265 --> 01:14:16,268
Yeah, the sneech may have
stolen a blind girl's

1692
01:14:16,304 --> 01:14:18,305
glasses and shot a jizz
pistol in a dude's mouth.

1693
01:14:18,341 --> 01:14:18,939
That happened.

1694
01:14:18,975 --> 01:14:20,542
That did.

1695
01:14:20,579 --> 01:14:23,382
I'm not asking you
for a second chance.

1696
01:14:23,418 --> 01:14:26,288
If this is the last time
I get to see you then I

1697
01:14:26,324 --> 01:14:31,699
understand, but you need
to know that from now on

1698
01:14:31,735 --> 01:14:34,939
I'm gonna be
who I really am.

1699
01:14:34,975 --> 01:14:37,478
Who I always was.

1700
01:14:39,318 --> 01:14:42,655
The sneech knows where
his real star is.

1701
01:14:45,497 --> 01:14:46,731
Okay.

1702
01:14:49,105 --> 01:14:50,672
Okay.

1703
01:14:56,052 --> 01:14:58,055
I'm so lonely.

1704
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,029
How we doing, boys?

1705
01:15:03,068 --> 01:15:06,506
Good, man. Bottom of nine,
all tied up.

1706
01:15:06,541 --> 01:15:08,007
How'd it go?

1707
01:15:08,046 --> 01:15:12,819
Not the
smoothest actually.

1708
01:15:12,853 --> 01:15:14,921
But atleast I
came clean to her.

1709
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:18,563
Yeah, well you're a better
man for it and all that.

1710
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,966
Right.

1711
01:15:20,002 --> 01:15:21,335
You're up, D.

1712
01:15:21,372 --> 01:15:22,371
Here we go!

1713
01:15:22,407 --> 01:15:23,440
Here we go!

1714
01:15:23,475 --> 01:15:24,708
Big D.

1715
01:15:25,447 --> 01:15:26,413
Here we go.

1716
01:15:26,449 --> 01:15:27,882
Move it back.
Here we go.

1717
01:15:27,917 --> 01:15:29,483
-Big hitter, big hitter!
-Denton.

1718
01:15:29,521 --> 01:15:31,524
Let's go.

1719
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,993
Dead man walking.

1720
01:15:36,804 --> 01:15:38,538
Everyone's getting
fucked in the ass.

1721
01:15:38,574 --> 01:15:40,509
I'm gonna fuck so many
bitches in your house,

1722
01:15:40,546 --> 01:15:41,779
it's gonna be disgusting.

1723
01:15:41,814 --> 01:15:44,885
Every single one of these fucks
is getting fucked in the ass.

1724
01:15:44,921 --> 01:15:48,426
Yeah, you're whole bedroom is
gonna be painted in my semen.

1725
01:15:49,896 --> 01:15:51,564
Time out!

1726
01:15:56,476 --> 01:15:57,743
Are you...

1727
01:15:58,582 --> 01:16:00,048
Hey, hi, hi!

1728
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:03,389
Denton, did you really
mean what you said?

1729
01:16:04,895 --> 01:16:06,796
It's the most honest
I've been all summer.

1730
01:16:06,832 --> 01:16:08,065
This is bullshit.

1731
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,068
Is this bet really
that important to you?

1732
01:16:10,105 --> 01:16:11,338
No.

1733
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:12,274
Come on.

1734
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:14,311
It's not as important
as being with you.

1735
01:16:15,516 --> 01:16:17,418
Let's play ball.

1736
01:16:29,712 --> 01:16:31,880
I gotta full on
Louisville Chubber.

1737
01:16:31,917 --> 01:16:33,050
Me too.

1738
01:16:35,658 --> 01:16:37,626
-Now go win this game.
-Okay.

1739
01:16:41,704 --> 01:16:42,903
Hey, Amanda?

1740
01:16:42,939 --> 01:16:45,108
Hi, Amanda Morrison?

1741
01:16:45,145 --> 01:16:46,778
-Yeah.
-I'm Denise Davids.

1742
01:16:46,814 --> 01:16:47,645
You don't know me.

1743
01:16:47,684 --> 01:16:49,685
Listen, I'm not
gonna hurt you, okay?

1744
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:52,790
I do have to show you
something right now.

1745
01:16:52,827 --> 01:16:53,993
It's important.

1746
01:16:54,029 --> 01:16:55,462
You may not like it.

1747
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,001
But you might.

1748
01:16:58,003 --> 01:16:58,801
Here we go, D.

1749
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,875
Knock his cock right
off of his body.

1750
01:17:00,911 --> 01:17:02,210
We want pain, we
wanna see blood.

1751
01:17:02,246 --> 01:17:04,715
-Here we go!
-Alright.

1752
01:17:04,752 --> 01:17:06,419
Let's see what you got.

1753
01:17:09,796 --> 01:17:10,929
This one's for you, daddy.

1754
01:17:10,965 --> 01:17:12,800
Son, I'm so
proud of you.

1755
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:14,168
Here we go, D.
Right in his pussy.

1756
01:17:14,204 --> 01:17:15,837
Right in his pussy.

1757
01:17:15,875 --> 01:17:17,108
Here we go.
Here we go.

1758
01:17:17,145 --> 01:17:18,411
Big hitter, big hitter.

1759
01:17:20,185 --> 01:17:23,122
You always made me proud,
and you know what,

1760
01:17:23,157 --> 01:17:25,025
your momma was proud, too.

1761
01:17:34,514 --> 01:17:35,880
Yo, B, we got a problem, dog.

1762
01:17:35,914 --> 01:17:36,980
Don't answer it.
Shut up.

1763
01:17:37,018 --> 01:17:38,184
Last night's movie leaked.

1764
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:39,654
Are you shitting me?

1765
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:43,528
Is this train
going to Paris?

1766
01:17:43,564 --> 01:17:44,896
Why indeed it is, ma'am.

1767
01:17:44,935 --> 01:17:45,934
All aboard.

1768
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:48,204
Next stop, the
Eiffel Tower.

1769
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,875
I love big, erect things.

1770
01:17:49,912 --> 01:17:52,915
Well you are in luck, ma'am,
because we have two.

1771
01:17:57,793 --> 01:18:00,229
Let's get a moving here.

1772
01:18:00,266 --> 01:18:01,900
My god.

1773
01:18:09,252 --> 01:18:10,852
Full steam ahead!

1774
01:19:23,104 --> 01:19:24,603
Fuck what you stand for!

1775
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,675
Fuck everything
that you like!

1776
01:19:26,712 --> 01:19:27,578
Yes!

1777
01:19:31,287 --> 01:19:32,253
You fucking...

1778
01:19:32,288 --> 01:19:34,557
You little son of a bitch!

1779
01:19:35,262 --> 01:19:36,695
Shut the fuck up, old man!

1780
01:19:36,733 --> 01:19:37,599
Hey, you know
what, Jackson?

1781
01:19:37,635 --> 01:19:38,900
You can have the game.

1782
01:19:38,935 --> 01:19:40,871
You'll never play in
this league again.

1783
01:19:40,908 --> 01:19:42,241
Denton lost the
fucking bet.

1784
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,846
Actually, Lucas,
no, he didn't.

1785
01:19:44,882 --> 01:19:45,948
You're bitch 11.

1786
01:19:45,985 --> 01:19:47,219
He's still one bitch shy.

1787
01:19:47,255 --> 01:19:48,755
That means your
house is mine.

1788
01:19:48,791 --> 01:19:50,692
And I'm gonna burn it to
the goddamn ground right

1789
01:19:50,729 --> 01:19:53,865
after I take a
huge shit in it.

1790
01:19:53,902 --> 01:19:55,234
Denise.

1791
01:19:55,273 --> 01:19:58,143
I think you have one more
text message to send.

1792
01:19:58,176 --> 01:19:59,342
What?

1793
01:20:09,064 --> 01:20:14,071
For our next motion picture,
the Pole Her Express.

1794
01:20:16,014 --> 01:20:18,349
Is this train going
to the south pole?

1795
01:20:18,384 --> 01:20:23,024
It isn't, ma'am, but
you can go south on my pole.

1796
01:20:23,061 --> 01:20:24,895
Let me slide
on down here.

1797
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:32,914
Lord, here we go.

1798
01:20:32,948 --> 01:20:35,183
Santa's dropping his load.

1799
01:20:35,921 --> 01:20:38,021
That's a whole lot of egg nog.

1800
01:20:38,059 --> 01:20:40,929
You're welcome.
Merry Christmas to you.

1801
01:20:40,965 --> 01:20:44,836
Twelve girls in one summer.

1802
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:45,907
Damn!

1803
01:20:45,942 --> 01:20:49,813
As my first official act
as the new CEO of Mr. B's

1804
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:51,751
Gourmet Condoms...

1805
01:20:52,255 --> 01:20:55,726
Mr. Lucas, you're
fucking fired.

1806
01:20:55,762 --> 01:20:59,333
Brandon, you are
super fucking fired.

1807
01:20:59,368 --> 01:21:01,871
What the hell is
going on?

1808
01:21:01,908 --> 01:21:06,381
The contact signed
by Brandon himself.

1809
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:10,055
Daddy, I can explain.

1810
01:21:12,762 --> 01:21:13,895
You goddamn fucking moron!

1811
01:21:13,932 --> 01:21:15,432
Daddy, I'm sorry!

1812
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:16,369
You greedy little shit.

1813
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:18,340
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
-Jesus fucking...

1814
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:20,109
Yeah, that's right.

1815
01:21:20,145 --> 01:21:22,414
You guys can suck
our black dicks.

1816
01:21:22,451 --> 01:21:25,453
Yeah, man. You can suck
all our black dicks.

1817
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:26,524
That's right, boy.

1818
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:29,931
Now as my second official
act as the CEO, I intend

1819
01:21:29,966 --> 01:21:33,770
to return the company back to
its original owner and creator.

1820
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:36,275
The world's
greatest inventor.

1821
01:21:36,313 --> 01:21:37,378
My dad.

1822
01:21:37,416 --> 01:21:38,515
-Me?
-Yes.

1823
01:21:38,551 --> 01:21:40,051
-You're giving it to me?
-Yes

1824
01:21:40,087 --> 01:21:42,824
- Me? My god.
- Yeah.

1825
01:21:43,261 --> 01:21:46,065
I kinda have a
thing for inventors.

1826
01:21:48,002 --> 01:21:50,037
-And you.
-No.

1827
01:21:50,074 --> 01:21:54,514
But there's still
something that I owe you.

1828
01:21:54,548 --> 01:21:55,515
Boom!

1829
01:21:55,551 --> 01:21:56,784
Dad! Dad?

1830
01:21:56,822 --> 01:21:58,122
That's right, Brandon.

1831
01:21:58,158 --> 01:22:00,126
We throw low around here.

1832
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:05,002
Rain jimmies on these bitches.

1833
01:22:05,038 --> 01:22:07,340
Get 'em up!
Throw 'em up!

1834
01:22:07,377 --> 01:22:08,376
All of them!

1835
01:22:08,412 --> 01:22:09,912
Get all of them!

1836
01:22:09,949 --> 01:22:12,418
Look, Amanda, about these
last couple months.

1837
01:22:12,454 --> 01:22:14,789
Screw your past.

1838
01:22:20,171 --> 01:22:24,444
Besides, I still haven't
told you about my summer.

1839
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:25,345
What?

1840
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:45,109
So let me get
this straight.

1841
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:46,478
You own the company.

1842
01:23:46,515 --> 01:23:47,347
Yup.

1843
01:23:47,384 --> 01:23:48,550
You stole the company.

1844
01:23:48,586 --> 01:23:49,552
Yup.

1845
01:23:49,587 --> 01:23:53,192
You won it back because
your son won a bet where

1846
01:23:53,229 --> 01:23:56,231
he had to sleep with
twelve girls in a summer.

1847
01:23:56,269 --> 01:23:57,435
A whole summer.

1848
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:59,070
You nailed it.

1849
01:24:03,483 --> 01:24:04,617
Gluten free.

1850
01:24:05,523 --> 01:24:06,889
Gluten free.
