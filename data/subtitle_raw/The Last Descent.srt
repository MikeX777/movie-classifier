00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,155
FEMALE NURSE:
ls there a name yet?

4
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,436
EMILY:
His name is John.

[airplane passing overhead]

6
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,298
It's slipping.

7
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,567
John.
-Oh. I got it. I got it.

8
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,602
John.
-I got it. I got it.

9
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,337
Somethings missing.
-What is it?

10
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,706
I think I left it on the plane.
-Left what?

11
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,223
The diaper bag.
It's not here.

12
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,511
Okay, you know what,
I'm gonna go back for it.

13
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,579
I'm gonna go back.

14
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,080
I'm gonna tear that plane
apart for you, all right?

15
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,516
First, hold this.
Thank you.

16
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,485
You goober.

17
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,086
Daddy thinks he's so funny.

18
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:03,256
Because I am funny.
[cell phone ringing]

19
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,492
Josh. Josh.
-John.

20
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:09,496
Josh. Where are you?

21
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:13,466
Josh, where are you? Can
you hear me, Josh? -John.

22
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,601
I can't hear you.
-He's right there.

23
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,735
I see him.
-I can't hear him. Where...

24
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:16,770
There you are.

25
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,039
Welcome to Utah.

26
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,774
[laughs]

27
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,108
How's my favorite niece?

28
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,277
You remember Uncle Joshy?

29
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,613
Yeah, your uncle
Osh Kosh B'Gosh.

30
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,481
Okay, Mr. John
Jacob Jingleheimer-

31
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,517
All fight, I'm done
with the nicknames.

32
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,419
Hey, race you to the car.

33
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,054
WOMAN:
Whoa.

34
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,056
Go ahead.

35
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:41,902
[music playing]

36
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,418
MAN: So, it's doctor's school.
You out anybody open yet?

37
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,153
No, not yet.

38
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,655
Stuffs harder
than it looks though.

39
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,423
Between the books
and the diapers, I am sleeping

40
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,393
at least a few times
a week, right, Ems?

41
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,195
Is he...
Uh, who are you?

42
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,296
[Josh laughing]

43
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,730
I'm just kidding.

44
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,667
No, he's on some crazy
new schedule, I think.

45
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,503
A 36-hour a day would make
my life a lot easier.

46
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,671
What have you been up to?

47
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,207
Oh, just work and school,
trying to transfer out

48
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,110
and get to a different
environment, I guess.

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,245
Oh, you're still the kid that wants
to get away from home, huh?

50
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,379
Yeah.
-Well, I get it.

51
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,515
But for the record,

52
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,618
it'd have been nice
if I could've stayed.

53
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,687
I'm glad
you're still here, though.

54
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:41,754
<i>I'm home.</i>

55
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,389
It wouldn't be home
without you.

56
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,624
Focus on driving.

57
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,794
Yeah, I'll try to.
Well, you're almost home.

58
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,195
What are you talking about?

59
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,730
Hey, Em, there's
a box back there.

60
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,133
It's a brown, rectangular...

61
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,733
Send that up, that'd be great.

62
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,704
Oh, wow. She's out.

63
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,172
That was quick.

64
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,532
She's a little juggernaut.

65
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:04,911
No way!
You brought 'em?

66
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,580
Hey, yes, I did.
-Yes.

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,282
I can't believe
you still have this.

68
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,818
Does it still even work?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

69
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,721
You know it's heavy duty
if it survives Dad.

70
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,757
These things'll be good for
another six generations, man.

71
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:18,825
This is awesome.

72
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,827
Yeah, thinking we've got
a little bit of time.

73
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,730
We've got all this gear
just sitting here, right now.

74
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,765
And Nutty Putty
just opened back up.

75
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,500
Maybe it'd be...
-Nutty Putty's open again?

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,803
Yeah. So I think it would be
a great opportunity

77
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:34,607
to show Emily
your great love for her

78
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,576
by forgetting everything
I'm saying right now.

79
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,312
Damage is done, Josh.
It's too late now.

80
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,314
But I get him
for the rest of the trip.

81
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,317
Yes! Yes, it is on. Yeah.

82
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,286
You know,
we have the whole

83
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,288
rest of the vacation
to act like kids.

84
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,822
Let's chill tonight.

85
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,925
And then maybe tomorrow before
I have to go back to Virginia.

86
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,527
After Thanksgiving we'll be
too fat to fit in the cave.

87
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,762
Besides, you know Mom.

88
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,297
She's not gonna let us
out of her sight

89
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,766
once she has the whole ﬂock
under one roof again.

90
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:04,116
You're trying to hide it,
but I know you want to go.

91
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,240
All fight, dude, I get it.
I mean, caves are scary, so,

92
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,943
I mean,
if you don't want to go...

93
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,778
It's whatever,
you do what you gotta do.

94
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,380
You could be more obvious
what you're doing.

95
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,740
Uh-huh. Okay.

96
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,788
I'm not scared.
You know that, right?

97
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:26,593
I know there's a cave, we both
want to go to forever, but like...

98
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,696
Hey, I said you could go.

99
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,964
All right, I'm in.
Let's do it. Yes!

100
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:31,998
Yes. Whoo!

101
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,633
It's on!
- [mouthing words]

102
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,993
Yes!

103
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,639
Okay.

104
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,008
For the record, that wasn't a win
that you just had, okay?

105
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,277
You didn't manipulate me.
I had to think things through

106
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,627
because I'm an adult,
I'm responsible...

107
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,718
JOHN: I'm not scared of the cave. There's
nowhere to be better than a cave.

108
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,078
It doesn't make any sense.

109
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,244
[ignition beeping]

110
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,347
[beeping stops]

111
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,992
All right.

112
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,460
Hey, you wanna...

113
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,763
You want to change the batteries
in your headlamp just to be safe?

114
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,531
We're only going
for a few hours so...

115
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,999
Mmm...
-All right, fine. Yeah.

116
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,503
Hey, just give me a call when
you're ready to come home, okay?

117
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,538
Okay.
-I'd like to talk about some stuff.

118
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,540
Oh, thanks. Stuff?
-Yeah, stuff.

119
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,909
What kind of stuff?
-Oh, just you know...

120
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,678
awesome Thanksgiving stuff,

121
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,447
but I want
to talk about it tonight.

122
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,615
About what?

123
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,617
It's married people stuff, man.
You wouldn't understand.

124
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,851
I don't want to know.

125
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,620
I'm scared. I have no idea
what you're talking about,

126
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,522
but you have my attention.
-Good, then be quick.

127
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,556
Okay.

128
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,024
Ooh. I don't want
to lose this in there.

129
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,384
Take that. Ah!

130
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,697
It's going in the diaper bag?
I'm never seeing that again.

131
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:11,931
Stop.

132
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,948
Why don't you buy me
a new one then?

133
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,037
All right, you win.
I love you.

134
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,605
I love you, too.

135
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:20,807
Have fun.
-I will.

136
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,167
[car engine starts]

137
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,346
Drive safe.
-See you later.

138
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,706
I miss you.

139
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,619
Ready to go?
-Yeah.

140
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,979
Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

141
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,675
I really can't believe it.

142
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,677
I didn't think they'd ever
open up this cave again.

143
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:01,681
Yeah, it's been like two years
since they closed it.

144
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,716
Only started letting people
back in in May.

145
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,718
They make you jumps through
hoops for these permits.

146
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,420
Permits?
-Yeah, dude.

147
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,389
It's like
a Mo-week wait to get 'em.

148
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,090
That's a big gamble taking Ems
about my health.

149
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,861
[chuckles]
Dude, you're predictable.

150
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,697
You gotta be known
for something.

151
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,175
You coming?
-Yeah.

152
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,429
Good to be home.

153
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,031
What do you think?
Six feet till it opens back up?

154
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,067
Oh, are you crazy?
-Come on, man.

155
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,417
I'm the one scared
of everything, right?

156
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,476
So what we're looking for
is The Birth Canal.

157
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,478
It should be around
here somewhere.

158
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,747
This is even one
of the easier squeezes

159
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,781
'cause everybody has to do it.

160
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,298
[both panting and struggling]

161
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:22,028
Heh, and I give you the slide.

162
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,211
JOSH: Let's do this.
-JOHN: All fight.

163
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,546
This place is unreal.

164
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:41,781
It's warm, too.

165
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,783
Yeah, I did a lot of reading
on this monster

166
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,085
before I got the permits.
-Yeah?

167
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,554
I guess, they haven't even
explored all of it yet.

168
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,156
Back before they closed it,
they were getting like

169
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,624
5.000 people a year.

170
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,259
That's a lot of people going
to a cave that has no end.

171
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,627
Right?

172
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:55,895
Did they say why
it's called Nutty Putty?

173

out of the rock, right,

it gets really humid,

00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,668
So don't think about me.
I'll still be here.

351
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,435
Just- Just don't think.
Just run.

352
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,373
It's okay.
-No.

353
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,376
It's okay. I'm okay.

354
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,736
It's okay.

355
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,517
Okay.
[sniff I F19]

356
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,877
Okay.

357
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,747
Okay.

358
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,402
[deep breath]

359
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,762
Okay.

360
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,307
If you can get in,
you can get out.

361
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,785
That's logical, fight?

362
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,947
They don't feel okay. Okay.

363
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,949
One, two...

364
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,495
[grunting]

365
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,923
I don't want to knock you off.

366
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,587
Okay.

367
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,409
A lot of good that's gonna do.

368
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,568
Come on, John.

369
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,803
You actually know
what you're doing

370
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:22,736
unlike everybody else that gets
stuck down here, all right?

371
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,479
Okay.

372
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,458
Breathe. Breathe.

373
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,964
[rain pattering;
no audible dialogue]

374
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,875
<i>WOMAN:
John?</i>

375
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,235
<i>Hey, John.</i>

376
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,318
WOMAN: Hey, John.
Hey, open it.

377
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,686
You got to drink
some water, buddy.

378
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:08,887
You've been down here a while.

379
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,589
[slurping]

380
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,949
Okay.

381
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,694
Yeah.

382
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,296
Did Josh find you?

383
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,730
WOMAN:
Yeah.

384
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,999
Me and a whole bunch
of other people.

385
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,934
Rescue crews are here.

386
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,636
I'm Susie, by the way.

387
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,506
And we're gonna get you
out of here, lickety-split.

388
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,474
Heh. Hi, Susie.

389
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,834
I'm John.

390
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,480
Uh, did you say a whole
bunch of people?

391
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,782
Oh, man.

392
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,850
Josh must think
this is his fault.

393
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,854
Can we talk about this guy
stuck in a cave under me?

394
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,389
[chuckles]

395
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,692
He tends
to beat himself up, is all.

396
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,360
Really, it's, uh,

397
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,630
what my whole family think...
That poor kid.

398
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,498
Great. Well...

399
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,368
you can be that worrywart,
but I'm gonna check up on you.

400
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,603
JOHN:
Okay.

401
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:01,840
Hey, can I... Can I out
some of your pants off?

402
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,008
JOHN:
Yeah.

403
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,344
It might give us
some more wiggle room.

404
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,754
Yeah.
-Okay.

405
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,020
[scissors snipping]

406
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,056
My wife is gonna love this one.
-Oh, yeah? Heh.

407
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,425
She gonna think
I'm getting fresh?

408
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,495
No, she's gonna love it
'cause she hates these jeans.

409
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:24,763
SUSIE [chuckles]:
Oh.

410
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,799
I tend to hold on to things
till they're way dead,

411
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,779
and, uh, I thought
I had a few more miles left.

412
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,509
Do you have a lot
of saliva building up?

413
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,145
Uh...Yeah.

414
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,481
My mouth
keeps filling up with it.

415
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,783
I feel like if I don't keep
spitting constantly,

416
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,551
it will go up into my nose.

417
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,911
Okay, just checking.

418
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,907
This angle
isn't good for my body.

419
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:59,431
I know, it's a curse of being
in medical school.

420
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,433
Whoa! Yeah?
-Yeah.

421
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,403
Okay, well, keep us up to date
on how you're feeling.

422
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,904
I mean, you're going to know

423
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,907
how to diagnose you
better than any of us.

424
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,267
JOHN:
Unfortunately.

425
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,679
I wish I could get this
a little tighter,

426
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,982
or a little higher up.

427
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:20,719
Hey, I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna save this,

428
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,054
and some of our guys
can get you out.

429
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,423
Are you ready?

430
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,024
[John gasps in relief]

431
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,798
Am I ever?
-Good.

432
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,163
All right, give it a pull!

433
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,513
MAN [in distance]:
Okay, give it a pull!

434
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,570
SUSIE:
Okay, okay, hold up!

435
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,472
Hold up.

436
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,807
That was a...

437
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,508
That was just a test...
-Mm-hmm.

438
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,143
...so don't worry, all fight?

439
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,503
Okay.

440
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,715
I'm gonna...

441
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,050
I'm gonna go
talk to some of the guys

442
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,220
about seeing if we can get
some more leverage.

443
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,555
You're leaving?

444
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,458
No, I- We'll get somebody here
to be with you, okay?

445
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,093
I just gotta... I got to talk
to the rest of my team.

446
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,729
Yeah. Okay.

447
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:07,566
We're gonna
get you out, John, okay?

448
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,201
JOHN:
Okay.

449
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,735
Wait a minute.

450
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,938
Hey, uh, Susie,

451
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,041
thank you for coming down.
Thank you for coming down here.

452
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,243
Heh. I'm sure
you had better things to do

453
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,178
the day before Thanksgiving.

454
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,714
[laughs]
Are you kidding?

455
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,016
Better today than tomorrow.

456
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,952
Some of us wouldn't
be able to fit in here

457
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,554
after some turkey and stuffing.
We'd all be real...

458
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,122
[balloon sound]

459
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,991
[both laugh]

460
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,093
JOHN:
Yeah.

461
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,928
Hey, can you reach your light?

462
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,598
Uh...

463
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,167
Yeah, I think so.
-Well, I just...

464
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,736
It depends on what
you can handle, you know?

465
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,838
You might want to conserve
the battery on that thing

466
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,740
as long as you can.

467
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,100
Yeah.

468
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,645
Got it. Okay, yeah.

469
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,005
SUSIE:
Okay. Okay.

470
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,111
Shoot.

482

Where's Hodgson?
-Right there.

483
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,199
Thanks.

484
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,868
And will someone get ahold
of the news station,

485
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:53,738
and get rid of that chopper'?
I can barely hear myself think.

486
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,807
How long you been standing there?
-Not long.

487
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,108
How's our boy
doing down there?

488
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,710
He's been trapped
at least three hours.

489
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,078
He's got near zero mobility,

490
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,713
and it's next to impossible
to get a rope on him

491
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,648
anywhere that gives us
any purchase.

492
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:04,883
Well, how deep is he?

493
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,952
Pretty much all the way down
in one of the unmapped parts.

494
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,688
About 100 feet below ground
through a bunch of tunnels.

495
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,356
HODGSON: I thought
they closed that place off.

496
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,024
SUSIE: They did,
it's been closed to the public,

497
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:16,061
but it looks like his brother
got a special permit to get in.

498
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,129
Sheriff Hodgson.
-Dr. Doug Murdock.

499
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,899
I'm a trauma critical care,
Utah Valley Medical.

500
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,867
How is John doing physically?

501
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,270
It's hard to say.
He's gurgling a lot.

502
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,606
What kind of angle's his body at?

503
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,975
He's pretty much
all the way down,

504
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,453
maybe a 70-degree angle.

505
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,146
The body can't survive that long.

506
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,948
Blood has to pump backwards,

507
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,384
circulation slows,
capillaries leak.

508
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,252
I mean, things start
to fail pretty quickly.

509
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,921
Well, how long has he got?

510
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,724
Considering how long
he's already been trapped,

511
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,159
he's gonna get delirious
in another two hours.

512
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:51,363
Six to eight hours from that,
his body starts shutting down.

513
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,666
So once we get him out,
is he going to be okay?

514
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,267
There'll be toxins
built up in his blood.

515
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,036
So if you take him out
on the wrong angle,

516
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,038
that could rush
to his heart and kill him.

517
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:03,274
So the faster we act,
the better his chances.

518
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,010
Let's get our guy
and get him down there.

519
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,245
Who's taking point?
-Aaron.

520
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,780
SUSIE:
Are you sure he's ready again?

521
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,715
I mean, he hasn't been
the same since Crandall.

522
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,317
HODGSON:
Yeah, none of us have been.

523
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,119
I know, and he thinks
he should have been in there.

524
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,755
This feels all too similar.
Should we tap someone else?

525
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,823
HODGSON: Aaron's the best
we got, you know that.

526
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,325
Besides that,
he loves that place.

527
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,027
He's been down there
mapping it for years.

528
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:25,627
That place is unique.
It's got to be Aaron.

529
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,373
Are you ready?
-Yeah, I'm headin' down.

530
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,942
What's the guy's name?
-John Jones.

531
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,344
Okay.
-How are you feeling?

532
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,180
Good.
-Are you sure?

533
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,382
Yeah. See you down there.

534
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,351
Hey, Aaron, you know
this could be a while.

535
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,086
It doesn't look like you're
taking a lot with you.

536
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,088
You've been
in this cave, Susie.

537
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,756
You know she doesn't like
to be stuffed.

538
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,692
HODGSON:
Whatever you think, Aaron.

539
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,993
Look, Susie gave us an idea

540
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,761
of what we're
working with down there.

541
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,296
Sol need you to get to him,

542
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,964
find a way to get him free,

543
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,299
and when the time comes,
we're going to have

544
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,149
to get real creative on this one.

545
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,720
I'm not coming out without him.

How are you feeling, buddy?

559
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,201
Can you get me out of here?

560
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,069
I'm kind of done
with being on my head.

561
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:49,073
The question is, what are
you doing on your head?

562
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,442
I wish it was a longer
and more interesting story.

563
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:54,292
AARON: I bet you do.
I bet you do.

564
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,482
Real story, it's gonna be
the one about

565
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,217
how we got you out of here.

566
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,985
[scoffs]

567
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,922
<i>SUSIE: John's body is too big
to just be pulled out.</i>

568
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,858
He's so deep, it's hard
to get any leverage.

569
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,494
It looks like when he went in,
he sucked in air

570
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,829
to squeeze in
where he's trapped.

571
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,231
So if we're going to get him out,
he's going to have to do it again

572
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,599
and push while we pull.

573
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,901
But there's a problem,
the tunnel bends

574
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,269
right against his back.

575
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,071
Meaning what?

576
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:24,921
Meaning we probably have
to break his legs to get him out.

577
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,278
JOHNI
That bad, huh?

578
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,047
AARON:
Eh, I've been a part of

579
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:32,550
a lot of search and rescues
that seem near impossible.

580
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,321
We'll figure this out, man,
no doubt in my mind.

581
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,681
JOHN:
Okay.

582
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:42,074
Here, you don't
need this fight now.

583
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,590
You're probably thirsty.

584
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,662
Drink coming down.

585
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,152
Got it. Thank you.

586
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,621
Is that lemon?

587
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,623
I always wondered
who bought that awful ﬂavor,

588
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,458
and now I know it's
you search and rescue guys.

589
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,027
Hey, I didn't buy it, all right?

590
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,629
I get what you mean, though.
It's disgusting.

591
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,631
It takes like
dish soap or something.

592
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,399
But, hey,
when we get on the surface,

593
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,468
you get me a bigger budget,

594
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,070
I'll come get the other guys
with, I don't know,

595
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,672

00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,276
Yeah. You know, actually,

AARON:
It's okay.

613
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:34,038
Cleanliness is impossible
in a wild beauty like this one.

614

Besides, it's crazy with walls
getting soft and hard.

Yeah.

Don't try it upside down,
you'll start seeing things.

And, uh, that's what
you call it, fight?

This is doing the same thing
and expecting a different result.

It's the definition
of insanity, right?

Brilliant.

The moisture's constantly working

652
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,147
It makes it both slick and soft.

far enough, we've got a real problem.

hope that they could pour it
on him and he'd just slip free.

00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,376
It just doesn't always go that way.

697

JOHN:
You know, uh,

698
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:36,307
I could actually go for
some more Gatorade right now.

699
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:37,441
[chuckles]

700
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,611
You sure it's not gonna
make matters worse?

701
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,414
That stuff really
isn't that bad anymore.

702
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,017
AARON: All right.
Hold on. Just a second.

703
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,985
All right.

704
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:50,345

705
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,021
Thank you.

706

You got it?

707
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,109
Got it.

708
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,392
Yeah, that stuff
really isn't that bad.

709
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:32,409
I used to think
it tasted like dish soap, but...

710
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,546
JOHN:
It's becoming my favorite.

711
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,226

Hey, Aaron.
-Yeah?

How are you doing?

715
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,680
I'm great, man.
-You good?

716
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,850
AARON: Hey, don't worry
about me, okay?

717
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,485
You just focus on breathing.

718
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,120
You just breathe.

719
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,480
Very slow. Slow and easy.

[Aaron grunts, exhales]

721
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:14,438
Well, we've got
a little bit of time here.

722
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,107
Why don't you tell me
about yourself, John.

723
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,942
Where are you from?

724
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,478
Oh, and, uh, make sure
you take a deep breath

725
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,079
before you start talking.

726
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:25,082
I want you to breathe
slow and easy for now.

727
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,442
Slow and easy.

back into my mission.

Look at you assuming things.

Nobody wants
to be that guy, you know?

to suffer through Spanish?

Yeah, it sucked.

When I can.
I sound terrible, though.

Yeah.

so much time out there

Hey, John,

825
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,161
promise me you won't
talk like that again.

826
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:13,030
It's just...

827
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,047
We just don't need
to talk about it.

828
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,869
I'm pretty sure you get
to talk life and death

829
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,739
with people like me
all the time, right?

830
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,806
[sighs]

831
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:25,075
Well, I try to avoid it.

832
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,477
To be honest with you, man,

833
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:29,213
I haven't really been into
the church thing for a while.

834
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:31,415
Really, any kind of church.

835
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,283
Just wasn't your thing or...

836
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:34,518
I don't know.

837
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:37,921
I'm just living my life
a day at a time,

838
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,291
just trying to do my job right,
help people.

839
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,894
They can learn about
all that life and death stuff

840
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,363
when they're on the surface,
when we're not involved.

841
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,966
So helping people»

842
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,202
Look at that.

843
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,204
You believe
in something, right?

844
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,564
Yeah, sure.

845
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:06,316
I thought you were gonna start
preaching to me.

846
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,919
[chuckles]

847
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,923
No. To each their own.

848
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:15,125
It's fun to hear
other people's thoughts

849
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,027
on this stuff, though.

850
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:18,395
It probably sounds
lame to most,

851
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:22,443
but to be honest,
it makes me feel at peace.

852
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,203
Yeah, that's the reason

853
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:29,006
why we do all this
church stuff anyway, right?

854
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,508
To feel good?
-I guess so.

855
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:34,077
It'd probably be good if
more people treated it like that.

856
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,847
You know,
as long as you find

857
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,148
what makes you happy.

858
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,250
Yeah? I mean, that's kind of
the endless search

859
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,886
for everyone, it seems,
and every time...

860
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:44,922
[laughs]
Wow!

861
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:47,282

AARON: Look at you
sneaking that in on me.

863
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:54,064
Man, you want me
to save you first,

864
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:57,568
and then you can do
your rescue on me.

865
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:01,115
No, I'm just conversing, is all.

866
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:04,575
That was obviously...

867
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:09,008
They were suggestions,
so I'll be sticking you to it.

869
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,349
You're something else, dude.

872
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:18,956
[grunts]

873
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:21,316
Come on!

874
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,161
[drill whirring in distance]

875
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,011
That sounds like it's going well.

876
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:29,591
Yeah, it better be.

877
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,535
So what brought you
down here anyways?

878
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:36,139
I mean, I'd assume
you're pretty used to caving.

879
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,474
What tipped you off?

880
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:40,210
Well, you're sporting some
fantastic vintage headlamps.

881
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:44,948
Besides, most people are
too afraid to get down this far.

882
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:48,715
I guess I could never
turn down an adventure.

883
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,022
That's probably
how I ended up in Virginia.

884
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:54,382
Really? What's in Virginia?

885
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:59,096
I'm going to school to be
a pediatric cardiologist.

886
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:03,200
Oh, so you're
working with kids?

887
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,369
Yeah.

888
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:08,005
Well, at least their hearts.
-Phew.

889
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:11,141
What made you want to do that?
Isn't that like 50 years of school?

890
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,501
JOHN:
Give or take.

891
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,605
My...

892
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,686
My sister, uh,

893
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,923
my younger sister had
heart surgery when she was four.

894
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,526
And I wanted to...

895
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,355
You know, it's sad.

896
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:42,339
You have to be on the edge
of losing everything

897
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,007
to really open your eyes

898
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:47,645
and... see the beauty
in the simple things.

899
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:54,146
Hey, I thought we weren't
gonna talk like that, John?

900
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:58,155
I've been studying
to be a doctor

901
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:01,024
the past few years, and...

902
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,460
I can hear my own breathing, man.

903
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,396
Yeah, I can't sugarcoat
things for you.

904
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,031
Obviously, John,
I know this is bad,

905
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:11,881
but you're gonna get
out of here, you have to.

906
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,470
I wish I could believe
any fib you could give me.

907
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,651
I don't want to die down here.

908
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:38,061
I told you
I can hear my breathing.

909
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:40,597
JOHN:
Please, just stop.

910
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:41,765
John, look at me.

911
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,767
Why didn't I spend
more time with my wife?

912
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:46,570
No, hey, John, look at me.
Listen, look at me!

913
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,930
Eyes on me, right here.

914
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:07,515
I believe you.

915
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:18,369
<i>[III]</i>

916
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,141
Such a John thing to do.

917
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,343
Always pushing himself
just a little too hard.

918
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:29,346
Well, that's why he's so strong.

919
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:32,349
And that's what's going
to get him through this.

920
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:36,353
He's gotten himself into some
crazy situations before, right?

921
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,555
Rock climbing, scuba diving.

922
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,390
Getting married?

923
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,526
Yeah, that's one
he's not getting out of.

924
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:44,795
I don't care how deep
of a hole he crawls down.

925
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,596
Yeah.

926
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,632
The guy on phone told me
there's already

927
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,368
a bunch of people there
working to get him out.

928
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:54,337
And as soon as I hung up,
I knew it was gonna be okay.

929
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:56,373
And I still know it.

930
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:57,774
They're getting him out.

931
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,843
Look, Em,
Pvejust been down there,

932
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,678
and I know how it is.

933
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:03,513
And I don't want
to take away hope.

934
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,382
He will, Josh, he will get out.

935
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:08,326
How do you know?
-Because...

936
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,449
Because he has to.

937
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:18,695
<i>AARON: All right,
you're obviously a stud.</i>

938
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:20,864
You're in med school,

939
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:25,135
which takes serious foresight
to make it work, let's be honest.

940
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:27,671
I bet that wife of yours

941
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,706
feels pretty lucky
that she snagged you, huh?

942
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:33,376
Uh-uh.
You got it backwards.

943
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,612
I had to win her over.

944
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,114
Yeah.

945
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,316
She made me fight for it.

946
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,828
Really?
Like a fight, huh?

947
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:44,354
Yeah.

948
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,456
I'd have preferred a fist fight.

949
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,693
It would have been less painful.

950
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:52,053
Easier on my heart. Heh.

951
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,801
Well...
Wait, wait, wait, you're going

952
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,436
to leave me hanging
right there'?

953
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,738
Come on.

954
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:03,273
You've got to tell me
about this girl

955
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:06,376
that completely owned you.

956
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:10,424
Oh, she is, uh...
She's everything.

957
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:16,553
It's one thing to find a girl

958
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,929
that who you want to marry.

959
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,226
And it's something
completely different

960
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:26,409
to find a girl
that you have to marry.

961
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,376
[John coughing]

962
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:33,094
Damn.

-EMILY: Hey!

964
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:56,273
You're gonna get yourself killed.

965
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:00,897
This is the first time I met you.

966
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:03,257
At a crosswalk.

967
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:04,534
I'm sorry?

968
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,269
We realized we were going
to same class together.

969
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,238
You're in O. Chem, too?

970
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:09,940
You must be
a glutton for punishment.

971
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,300
I'm John.

00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:14,811

973
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,213
Emily.

<i>JOHN: I immediately wished
I had something more to say</i>

976

[light chattering]

979
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:56,820
Hey, guys, I'm taking off.

980
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,288
Where are you going?

981
00:55:58,388 --> 00:55:59,990
Home.

982
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,692
Wow, Mr. "Let's pull
an all nighter" is leaving early.

983
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:05,428
A little distracted. I'm sorry.

984
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,788
See you at class.

I am so sorry.

988
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:24,347
Here, let me get those.

989
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:28,418
Is this like a normal thing
for you, running into things?

990
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,387
No, destiny did this.

991
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,989
I swear, I'm usually like
really... I'm nimble.

992
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:36,493
Yeah, for you, destiny's
kind of a jerk, if you ask me.

993
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:40,843
Taking away your grace,
throwing you at cars, at me.

994
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:42,565
Yeah, you've got
a serious issue

995
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:43,867
with that destiny guy,
too, I guess.

996
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:45,835
Taking away my nimble,

997
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:49,039
my ability to be nim...
and words.

998
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:53,009
<i>I'm a funny person, I swear
I am, but funny John was gone.</i>

<i>But! was determined
to make her laugh.</i>

1000
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:58,515
<i>Make the girl smile,
and you got a chance, right?</i>

1001
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,417
This is cool.

1002
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:02,085
Orange, that's...

1003
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:04,935

or something?

1004
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:08,625
<i>Yeah, 1 had no game
whatsoever.</i>

1005

<i>And then finally...</i>

1006
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:13,763
Wait, we're going fishing

1007
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:14,998
at midnight
at the Provo Golf Course,

1008
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,734
and you should... You'll love it,
you should totally come.

<i>1 had no idea
where that came from.</i>

<i>We weren't going fishing.
I didn't even know who we was.</i>

<i>I'm 90% sure there's
no fish in any of the ponds</i>

<i>that we'd have
to trespass to get to.</i>

Really?

1014
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:31,081
Unfortunately, yeah.

1015
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:33,441
I'm soin.

1016
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,778
What?

00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,857
<i>1 pooled together the fastest
fake tradition ever.</i>

EMILY: This is crazy.
You guys do this all the time?

1019
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:46,062
Yeah, what else
are you gonna do

1020
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:47,530
in the middle
of the night in Provo?

1021
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,433
Actually, I kind of take you
as a bookworm.

1022
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:51,868
I'm pretty sure I've seen you

1023
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,070
somewhere in that library
every time I go.

1024
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,839
Wait, you've seen me before?

1025
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,141
Yeah, you're always there.
It's not like I could miss you.

1026
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,410
What was with this whole
destiny stuff then?

1027
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,845
This whole time you were tailing me.

1028
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:04,848
Okay, destiny, first off,
that's your word,

1029
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:07,851
and second, destiny for you
was a well-timed hit

1030
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,819
that nearly ruined
my research paper.

1031
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:11,888
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

1032
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,657
Anyways, now here we go.

1033
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:17,427
It is dark outside,
so be careful when you cast.

1034
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:18,795
Okay.
-Because...

1035
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,063
...you may hook somebody.

1036
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,498
All right, got it.

1037
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:25,068
So cast her and the hook
in the water, fight?

1038
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,670
Yeah. You've never
fished before, have you?

1039
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,940
No. Ha ha, but I've seen it
in the movies, so...

1040
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,509
Yeah, that's good enough.
-Okay.

1041
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:34,511
That's absolutely fine, so...
-All right.

1042
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:37,046
Geez. Calm down, stop, stop!

1043
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:38,148
Stop.
-I'm so sorry.

You guys good back there?
-MAN: We're good.

-EMILY: All right.

All right, let me slowly breathe.

1048
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:46,556
Okay, I'm sorry.
-Don't say sorry to me.

1049
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:48,425

said sorry to them.

I don't know what I'm doing.

I'm- I just...

1052
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:56,666
I don't like not knowing how
to do things, and this is just...

1053
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:58,868
"I don't not like not knowing
how to do things"?

1054
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,437
That's a fantastic
double negative.

1055
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,472
Yeah, uh...
-So, you're good at that.

1056
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,140
Can you just show me

1057
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,676
how to do this,
so I don't go nuts

1058
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:09,212

Well, yeah, I can.

We really got to focus
on your technique,

1061

1062
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:16,820

It's four months,

1090

you can get back
to living in the library,

I love you.
Marry me, Ems.

if I let you go again,

1127
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:10,126
then I won't get another
chance to marry you.

1128

But... I just got to ask.

1136

I never had
a feeling this strong.

1137
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:36,788
So, Ems, will you marry me?

1138
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:42,725
I'm sorry.

1139
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:45,085
I just can't.

Well, technically,

1143
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:01,244
she didn't really
say anything, I guess.

1144
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:02,945
What?

1145
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:05,181

that song for her,

1147
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,152
and it was just nothing?

1148
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:11,287
Yeah.

01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,923
I don't really have
a good voice, though.

01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,225
No...

1151
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,394
It only makes sense,

1152
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:21,494
you gotta fight
for a girl like that.

Can you tell her I'm sorry?

1212
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:10,266

I'm so sorry
to put her through this.

Ems, I've told you everything
that was in my heart.

1312
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:01,223
And I knew
you had your doubts

1313

about me and about us and...

1314
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:08,397
I know just as long as I could
spend all the days I have

1315
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:10,866
on this earth with you,
then those days

1316
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:13,335
would be good days...
great days.

1317
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,838
They'd be great
because they would be ours.

1318
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,640
And I couldn't imagine
any future

1319

more wonderful
than one that had you in it.

the same way that I look...

It didn'tfeel fight before, fight?
But it feels fight now.

And marriage is a big thing.
It's a huge thing.

1330

And I can't just say yes
or I couldn't say yes.

1331

But I mean, I say yes now.

And, okay,
I shouldn't have done that,

1333

just say something
