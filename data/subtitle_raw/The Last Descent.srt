00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,155
FEMALE NURSE:
ls there a name yet?

4
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,436
EMILY:
His name is John.

[airplane passing overhead]

6
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,298
It's slipping.

7
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,567
John.
-Oh. I got it. I got it.

8
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,602
John.
-I got it. I got it.

9
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,337
Somethings missing.
-What is it?

10
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,706
I think I left it on the plane.
-Left what?

11
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,223
The diaper bag.
It's not here.

12
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,511
Okay, you know what,
I'm gonna go back for it.

13
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,579
I'm gonna go back.

14
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,080
I'm gonna tear that plane
apart for you, all right?

15
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,516
First, hold this.
Thank you.

16
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,485
You goober.

17
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,086
Daddy thinks he's so funny.

18
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:03,256
Because I am funny.
[cell phone ringing]

19
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,492
Josh. Josh.
-John.

20
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:09,496
Josh. Where are you?

21
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:13,466
Josh, where are you? Can
you hear me, Josh? -John.

22
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,601
I can't hear you.
-He's right there.

23
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,735
I see him.
-I can't hear him. Where...

24
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:16,770
There you are.

25
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,039
Welcome to Utah.

26
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,774
[laughs]

27
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,108
How's my favorite niece?

28
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,277
You remember Uncle Joshy?

29
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,613
Yeah, your uncle
Osh Kosh B'Gosh.

30
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,481
Okay, Mr. John
Jacob Jingleheimer-

31
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,517
All fight, I'm done
with the nicknames.

32
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,419
Hey, race you to the car.

33
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,054
WOMAN:
Whoa.

34
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,056
Go ahead.

35
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:41,902
[music playing]

36
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,418
MAN: So, it's doctor's school.
You out anybody open yet?

37
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,153
No, not yet.

38
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,655
Stuffs harder
than it looks though.

39
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,423
Between the books
and the diapers, I am sleeping

40
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,393
at least a few times
a week, right, Ems?

41
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,195
Is he...
Uh, who are you?

42
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,296
[Josh laughing]

43
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,730
I'm just kidding.

44
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,667
No, he's on some crazy
new schedule, I think.

45
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,503
A 36-hour a day would make
my life a lot easier.

46
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,671
What have you been up to?

47
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,207
Oh, just work and school,
trying to transfer out

48
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,110
and get to a different
environment, I guess.

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,245
Oh, you're still the kid that wants
to get away from home, huh?

50
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,379
Yeah.
-Well, I get it.

51
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,515
But for the record,

52
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,618
it'd have been nice
if I could've stayed.

53
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,687
I'm glad
you're still here, though.

54
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:41,754
<i>I'm home.</i>

55
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,389
It wouldn't be home
without you.

56
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,624
Focus on driving.

57
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,794
Yeah, I'll try to.
Well, you're almost home.

58
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,195
What are you talking about?

59
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,730
Hey, Em, there's
a box back there.

60
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,133
It's a brown, rectangular...

61
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,733
Send that up, that'd be great.

62
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,704
Oh, wow. She's out.

63
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,172
That was quick.

64
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,532
She's a little juggernaut.

65
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:04,911
No way!
You brought 'em?

66
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,580
Hey, yes, I did.
-Yes.

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,282
I can't believe
you still have this.

68
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,818
Does it still even work?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

69
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,721
You know it's heavy duty
if it survives Dad.

70
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,757
These things'll be good for
another six generations, man.

71
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:18,825
This is awesome.

72
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,827
Yeah, thinking we've got
a little bit of time.

73
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,730
We've got all this gear
just sitting here, right now.

74
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,765
And Nutty Putty
just opened back up.

75
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,500
Maybe it'd be...
-Nutty Putty's open again?

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,803
Yeah. So I think it would be
a great opportunity

77
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:34,607
to show Emily
your great love for her

78
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,576
by forgetting everything
I'm saying right now.

79
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,312
Damage is done, Josh.
It's too late now.

80
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,314
But I get him
for the rest of the trip.

81
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,317
Yes! Yes, it is on. Yeah.

82
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,286
You know,
we have the whole

83
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,288
rest of the vacation
to act like kids.

84
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,822
Let's chill tonight.

85
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,925
And then maybe tomorrow before
I have to go back to Virginia.

86
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,527
After Thanksgiving we'll be
too fat to fit in the cave.

87
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,762
Besides, you know Mom.

88
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,297
She's not gonna let us
out of her sight

89
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,766
once she has the whole ï¬‚ock
under one roof again.

90
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:04,116
You're trying to hide it,
but I know you want to go.

91
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,240
All fight, dude, I get it.
I mean, caves are scary, so,

92
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,943
I mean,
if you don't want to go...

93
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,778
It's whatever,
you do what you gotta do.

94
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,380
You could be more obvious
what you're doing.

95
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,740
Uh-huh. Okay.

96
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,788
I'm not scared.
You know that, right?

97
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:26,593
I know there's a cave, we both
want to go to forever, but like...

98
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,696
Hey, I said you could go.

99
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,964
All right, I'm in.
Let's do it. Yes!

100
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:31,998
Yes. Whoo!

101
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,633
It's on!
- [mouthing words]

102
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,993
Yes!

103
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,639
Okay.

104
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,008
For the record, that wasn't a win
that you just had, okay?

105
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,277
You didn't manipulate me.
I had to think things through

106
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,627
because I'm an adult,
I'm responsible...

107
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,718
JOHN: I'm not scared of the cave. There's
nowhere to be better than a cave.

108
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,078
It doesn't make any sense.

109
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,244
[ignition beeping]

110
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,347
[beeping stops]

111
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,992
All right.

112
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,460
Hey, you wanna...

113
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,763
You want to change the batteries
in your headlamp just to be safe?

114
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,531
We're only going
for a few hours so...

115
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,999
Mmm...
-All right, fine. Yeah.

116
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,503
Hey, just give me a call when
you're ready to come home, okay?

117
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,538
Okay.
-I'd like to talk about some stuff.

118
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,540
Oh, thanks. Stuff?
-Yeah, stuff.

119
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,909
What kind of stuff?
-Oh, just you know...

120
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,678
awesome Thanksgiving stuff,

121
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,447
but I want
to talk about it tonight.

122
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,615
About what?

123
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,617
It's married people stuff, man.
You wouldn't understand.

124
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,851
I don't want to know.

125
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,620
I'm scared. I have no idea
what you're talking about,

126
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,522
but you have my attention.
-Good, then be quick.

127
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,556
Okay.

128
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,024
Ooh. I don't want
to lose this in there.

129
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,384
Take that. Ah!

130
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,697
It's going in the diaper bag?
I'm never seeing that again.

131
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:11,931
Stop.

132
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,948
Why don't you buy me
a new one then?

133
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,037
All right, you win.
I love you.

134
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,605
I love you, too.

135
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:20,807
Have fun.
-I will.

136
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,167
[car engine starts]

137
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,346
Drive safe.
-See you later.

138
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,706
I miss you.

139
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,619
Ready to go?
-Yeah.

140
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,979
Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

141
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,675
I really can't believe it.

142
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,677
I didn't think they'd ever
open up this cave again.

143
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:01,681
Yeah, it's been like two years
since they closed it.

144
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,716
Only started letting people
back in in May.

145
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,718
They make you jumps through
hoops for these permits.

146
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,420
Permits?
-Yeah, dude.

147
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,389
It's like
a Mo-week wait to get 'em.

148
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,090
That's a big gamble taking Ems
about my health.

149
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,861
[chuckles]
Dude, you're predictable.

150
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,697
You gotta be known
for something.

151
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,175
You coming?
-Yeah.

152
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,429
Good to be home.

153
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,031
What do you think?
Six feet till it opens back up?

154
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,067
Oh, are you crazy?
-Come on, man.

155
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,417
I'm the one scared
of everything, right?

156
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,476
So what we're looking for
is The Birth Canal.

157
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,478
It should be around
here somewhere.

158
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,747
This is even one
of the easier squeezes

159
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,781
'cause everybody has to do it.

160
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,298
[both panting and struggling]

161
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:22,028
Heh, and I give you the slide.

162
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,211
JOSH: Let's do this.
-JOHN: All fight.

163
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,546
This place is unreal.

164
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:41,781
It's warm, too.

165
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,783
Yeah, I did a lot of reading
on this monster

166
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,085
before I got the permits.
-Yeah?

167
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,554
I guess, they haven't even
explored all of it yet.

168
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,156
Back before they closed it,
they were getting like

169
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,624
5.000 people a year.

170
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,259
That's a lot of people going
to a cave that has no end.

171
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,627
Right?

172
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:55,895
Did they say why
it's called Nutty Putty?

173
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,831
Yeah. I guess as you get
deeper into the cave,

174
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,967
you'll see
these nodules of chert

175
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,169
that are seeping
out of the rock, right,

176
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,971
and as you get deeper in,
it gets really humid,

177
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,106
so it makes it soft, so you can work it
between your fingers,

178
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,942
and it don't... it feels like
you're handling honey.

179
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,811
Rocks that turn into honey?

180
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,513
Are you kidding me?
We have to do that.

181
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,580
Right?
-Yeah.

182
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,885
Well, I don't think it
actually turns into honey,

183
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,887
and I think you got
to get pretty deep, too.

184
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,655
I don't know.
-Well...

185
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,590
I could be messing
it all up my head.

186
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,193
Well, the more you know.

187
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,295
<i>â™ª Bam, bam, ham, bam I</i>

188
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,130
That's absolutely
not the jingle, but nice try.

189
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,532
[laughs]

190
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,133
Whatever, man.
Whatever.

191
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,568
JOHN: I gotta
be honest, I'm impressed

192
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:36,903
with your suddenly
random knowledge.

193
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,305
I'm just reciting what I read
fight off of the web page.

194
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,240
Oh, take the win, Josh.
Oh, come on, man.

195
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,042
I really love it

196
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,144
when you accidentally
show your awesomeness.

197
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,680
You don't need to clown me.
-I'm not clowning you.

198
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,849
I'm not.
You know, I'm only good

199
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,651
at anything
because I get pushed.

200
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,952
Okay?

201
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,587
Like when
I was a high school kid,

202
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:55,955
and you were just the kid,
you know,

203
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,057
you used to show me up when
you hung with the older guys.

204
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,560
But it made me
look great, you know?

205
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,094
Like remember
that one time at Scout camp,

206
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,629
where I came
with a mascot thing?

207
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,264
Oh, yeah, yeah. Beav.
-Yeah, The Beav.

208
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,566
You know,
went and carved it

209
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,700
on all the trees
where you were camping.

210
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,201
It looked awesome.
-Yeah. Yeah, it did.

211
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,203
It did, it looked awesome.

212
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,605
You know,
a large chunk of who I am

213
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:16,742
is because, you know, of you.

214
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,978
And that's
a good thing, though.

215
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,787
Hopefully, I return
the favor, even slightly.

216
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,319
Yeah.

217
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,655
Yeah. Let's keep going.

218
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,359
[imitating Yoda]
Proud of you, I am, Joshwalker.

219
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,761
You can't just let a moment
be a moment, can you, man?

220
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,330
I can't.
- [Josh laughs]

221
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,932
It's getting harder to do, too.
My throat hurts.

222
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,292
Ah, wait up.
-All right.

223
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,387
It's got to be
around here somewhere.

224
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,624
Still worth looking for?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

225
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,158
It's supposed to be really cool.

226
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,094
It's okay. I'm enjoying this, man.
I missed you.

227
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,929
- [laughs]
-Don't tell anyone. Here.

228
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,097
JOSH:
Thank you. Here you go.

229
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,366
JOSH: Thanks.
-Okay.

230
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,726
[deep breathing]

231
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,404
It should be close.
Let's split up.

232
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,805
Let's do it. Yeah.

233
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,407
Scream like a pterodactyl
if you find anything.

234
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,642
You spaz.

235
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,002
JOSH:
Oh, man.

236
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,382
<i>[III]</i>

237
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:22,271
Ah. Come on.

238
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,222
[grunting]

239
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,160
Okay.

240
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,567
[groaning and deep breathing]

241
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,433
No kidding, Josh.

242
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,068
That first crawl was nothing.

243
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,836
Okay.

244
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,196
All right.

245
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,444
Okay. All right.

246
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,512
Okay.

247
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:43,560
We're gonna do this,
and then...

248
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,333
[grunting]

249
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,068
Nope, this isn't good.

250
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,428
I got to turn around.

251
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,797
Oh!

252
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,934

[heart beating]

254
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,909
You've got to be kidding me.

255
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,387
Josh.

256
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,707
Josh! Josh!

257
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,461
Josh, are you near me?

258
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,437
[distant mufï¬‚ed]
Josh, can you hear me?

259
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,880
Josh!

260
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,548
Are you kidding me with this?

261
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,949
Come on, Josh.

262
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,309
Josh!

263
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,615
Crazy.

264
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,786
Come on, Josh.

265
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,531
Josh!

266
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,891
Geez.

267
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,594
I can't even think.

268
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,797
I can't even think.

269
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,800

JOSH [distant muffled]:

273
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,289
Josh.
-John, I can't hear you.

274
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,124
Josh, are you near me?
-What?

275
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,993
Say it again.
-What do you mean?

276
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,926
I don't know
what tube you're down.

â™ª Gently down the stream... â™ª
Got it'?

283

you could be singing right now.

284
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,009
Holy crap.

00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,026
Holy crap.

287
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,395
Of all the tunnels
you could have gone in...

00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,823
...whoo, this is the one.

00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,035
John?

291
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,470
Yeah?
-John.

292
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,813
On. Uh, uh...

293
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,308
Wow.
-Yeah, I don't know.

294
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,509
Just don't come down here, okay?

295
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,012
Okay.
-Can you reach me to pull?

296
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,581
Uh, not with my hands.
That's not a good idea.

297
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,683
Um, let me
try something else, okay?

Man it's dark.

302
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,757
Shoot.

00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,066

Okay.

John, what in the world...

306
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:55,434
Not that I just... I can't even
figure out how you got down there.

307
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,436
I'm actually kind of impressed
though, like, I'm not even mad.

JOHN: Josh, you can't
come down here.

309
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,339
You got to stop.

310
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,808
I'm not gonna let you sit there.
I just got to figure this out.

311
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,344
Um...

312
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,550
Can you turn at all? -No.

00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,977
I'm completely stuck.

00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,290
Okay, I'm gonna wrap my legs
around you and pull, okay?

316
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,825
Got n.
-All right.

317
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,661

All right.

322
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,536
We'll do something else.

323
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,682
Okay, there we go.

324
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,127
Okay.

325
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,628
You know what,
we're just gonna do it.

326
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,231
I'm just gonna pull you
out of here, all right?

327
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,366

Hey.

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,811
Are you okay?
Are you hurting?

331
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,881
No, no, I'm fine.
Why not, right?

332
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,928
Huh, yeah.
For real, you're good?

333
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,221
I'm better.

334
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,522
Okay.
-All right.

335
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,757
All right. On three.
-Uh-huh.

336
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:30,429
Yeah. One, two, three.

No.

Yeah, okay, that's
probably smart.

Yeah, just go, Josh.
I'll be fine.

346

I can't leave you down here.

-I'm getting you out.

349
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,566
Just go. Okay, I'm not
going anywhere, right?

350
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,668
So don't think about me.
I'll still be here.

351
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,435
Just- Just don't think.
Just run.

352
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,373
It's okay.
-No.

353
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,376
It's okay. I'm okay.

354
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,736
It's okay.

355
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,517
Okay.
[sniff I F19]

356
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,877
Okay.

357
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,747
Okay.

358
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,402
[deep breath]

359
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,762
Okay.

360
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,307
If you can get in,
you can get out.

361
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,785
That's logical, fight?

362
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,947
They don't feel okay. Okay.

363
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,949
One, two...

364
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,495
[grunting]

365
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,923
I don't want to knock you off.

366
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,587
Okay.

367
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,409
A lot of good that's gonna do.

368
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,568
Come on, John.

369
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,803
You actually know
what you're doing

370
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:22,736
unlike everybody else that gets
stuck down here, all right?

371
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,479
Okay.

372
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,458
Breathe. Breathe.

373
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,964
[rain pattering;
no audible dialogue]

374
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,875
<i>WOMAN:
John?</i>

375
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,235
<i>Hey, John.</i>

376
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,318
WOMAN: Hey, John.
Hey, open it.

377
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,686
You got to drink
some water, buddy.

378
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:08,887
You've been down here a while.

379
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,589
[slurping]

380
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,949
Okay.

381
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,694
Yeah.

382
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,296
Did Josh find you?

383
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,730
WOMAN:
Yeah.

384
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,999
Me and a whole bunch
of other people.

385
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,934
Rescue crews are here.

386
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,636
I'm Susie, by the way.

387
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,506
And we're gonna get you
out of here, lickety-split.

388
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,474
Heh. Hi, Susie.

389
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,834
I'm John.

390
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,480
Uh, did you say a whole
bunch of people?

391
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,782
Oh, man.

392
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,850
Josh must think
this is his fault.

393
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,854
Can we talk about this guy
stuck in a cave under me?

394
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,389
[chuckles]

395
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,692
He tends
to beat himself up, is all.

396
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,360
Really, it's, uh,

397
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,630
what my whole family think...
That poor kid.

398
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,498
Great. Well...

399
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,368
you can be that worrywart,
but I'm gonna check up on you.

400
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,603
JOHN:
Okay.

401
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:01,840
Hey, can I... Can I out
some of your pants off?

402
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,008
JOHN:
Yeah.

403
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,344
It might give us
some more wiggle room.

404
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,754
Yeah.
-Okay.

405
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,020
[scissors snipping]

406
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,056
My wife is gonna love this one.
-Oh, yeah? Heh.

407
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,425
She gonna think
I'm getting fresh?

408
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,495
No, she's gonna love it
'cause she hates these jeans.

409
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:24,763
SUSIE [chuckles]:
Oh.

410
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,799
I tend to hold on to things
till they're way dead,

411
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,779
and, uh, I thought
I had a few more miles left.

412
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,509
Do you have a lot
of saliva building up?

413
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,145
Uh...Yeah.

414
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,481
My mouth
keeps filling up with it.

415
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,783
I feel like if I don't keep
spitting constantly,

416
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,551
it will go up into my nose.

417
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,911
Okay, just checking.

418
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,907
This angle
isn't good for my body.

419
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:59,431
I know, it's a curse of being
in medical school.

420
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,433
Whoa! Yeah?
-Yeah.

421
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,403
Okay, well, keep us up to date
on how you're feeling.

422
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,904
I mean, you're going to know

423
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,907
how to diagnose you
better than any of us.

424
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,267
JOHN:
Unfortunately.

425
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,679
I wish I could get this
a little tighter,

426
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,982
or a little higher up.

427
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:20,719
Hey, I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna save this,

428
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,054
and some of our guys
can get you out.

429
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,423
Are you ready?

430
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,024
[John gasps in relief]

431
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,798
Am I ever?
-Good.

432
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,163
All right, give it a pull!

433
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,513
MAN [in distance]:
Okay, give it a pull!

434
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,570
SUSIE:
Okay, okay, hold up!

435
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,472
Hold up.

436
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,807
That was a...

437
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,508
That was just a test...
-Mm-hmm.

438
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,143
...so don't worry, all fight?

439
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,503
Okay.

440
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,715
I'm gonna...

441
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,050
I'm gonna go
talk to some of the guys

442
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,220
about seeing if we can get
some more leverage.

443
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,555
You're leaving?

444
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,458
No, I- We'll get somebody here
to be with you, okay?

445
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,093
I just gotta... I got to talk
to the rest of my team.

446
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,729
Yeah. Okay.

447
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:07,566
We're gonna
get you out, John, okay?

448
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,201
JOHN:
Okay.

449
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,735
Wait a minute.

450
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,938
Hey, uh, Susie,

451
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,041
thank you for coming down.
Thank you for coming down here.

452
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,243
Heh. I'm sure
you had better things to do

453
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,178
the day before Thanksgiving.

454
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,714
[laughs]
Are you kidding?

455
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,016
Better today than tomorrow.

456
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,952
Some of us wouldn't
be able to fit in here

457
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,554
after some turkey and stuffing.
We'd all be real...

458
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,122
[balloon sound]

459
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,991
[both laugh]

460
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,093
JOHN:
Yeah.

461
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,928
Hey, can you reach your light?

462
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,598
Uh...

463
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,167
Yeah, I think so.
-Well, I just...

464
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,736
It depends on what
you can handle, you know?

465
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,838
You might want to conserve
the battery on that thing

466
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,740
as long as you can.

467
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,100
Yeah.

468
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,645
Got it. Okay, yeah.

469
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,005
SUSIE:
Okay. Okay.

470
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,111
Shoot.

Where's Hodgson?
-Right there.

483
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,199
Thanks.

484
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,868
And will someone get ahold
of the news station,

485
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:53,738
and get rid of that chopper'?
I can barely hear myself think.

486
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,807
How long you been standing there?
-Not long.

487
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,108
How's our boy
doing down there?

488
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,710
He's been trapped
at least three hours.

489
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,078
He's got near zero mobility,

490
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,713
and it's next to impossible
to get a rope on him

491
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,648
anywhere that gives us
any purchase.

492
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:04,883
Well, how deep is he?

493
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,952
Pretty much all the way down
in one of the unmapped parts.

494
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,688
About 100 feet below ground
through a bunch of tunnels.

495
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,356
HODGSON: I thought
they closed that place off.

496
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,024
SUSIE: They did,
it's been closed to the public,

497
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:16,061
but it looks like his brother
got a special permit to get in.

498
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,129
Sheriff Hodgson.
-Dr. Doug Murdock.

499
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,899
I'm a trauma critical care,
Utah Valley Medical.

500
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,867
How is John doing physically?

501
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,270
It's hard to say.
He's gurgling a lot.

502
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,606
What kind of angle's his body at?

503
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,975
He's pretty much
all the way down,

504
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,453
maybe a 70-degree angle.

505
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,146
The body can't survive that long.

506
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,948
Blood has to pump backwards,

507
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,384
circulation slows,
capillaries leak.

508
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,252
I mean, things start
to fail pretty quickly.

509
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,921
Well, how long has he got?

510
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,724
Considering how long
he's already been trapped,

511
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,159
he's gonna get delirious
in another two hours.

512
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:51,363
Six to eight hours from that,
his body starts shutting down.

513
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,666
So once we get him out,
is he going to be okay?

514
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,267
There'll be toxins
built up in his blood.

515
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,036
So if you take him out
on the wrong angle,

516
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,038
that could rush
to his heart and kill him.

517
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:03,274
So the faster we act,
the better his chances.

518
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,010
Let's get our guy
and get him down there.

519
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,245
Who's taking point?
-Aaron.

520
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,780
SUSIE:
Are you sure he's ready again?

521
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,715
I mean, he hasn't been
the same since Crandall.

522
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,317
HODGSON:
Yeah, none of us have been.

523
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,119
I know, and he thinks
he should have been in there.

524
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,755
This feels all too similar.
Should we tap someone else?

525
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,823
HODGSON: Aaron's the best
we got, you know that.

526
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,325
Besides that,
he loves that place.

527
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,027
He's been down there
mapping it for years.

528
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:25,627
That place is unique.
It's got to be Aaron.

529
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,373
Are you ready?
-Yeah, I'm headin' down.

530
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,942
What's the guy's name?
-John Jones.

531
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,344
Okay.
-How are you feeling?

532
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,180
Good.
-Are you sure?

533
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,382
Yeah. See you down there.

534
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,351
Hey, Aaron, you know
this could be a while.

535
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,086
It doesn't look like you're
taking a lot with you.

536
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,088
You've been
in this cave, Susie.

537
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,756
You know she doesn't like
to be stuffed.

538
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,692
HODGSON:
Whatever you think, Aaron.

539
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,993
Look, Susie gave us an idea

540
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,761
of what we're
working with down there.

541
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,296
Sol need you to get to him,

542
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,964
find a way to get him free,

543
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,299
and when the time comes,
we're going to have

544
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,149
to get real creative on this one.

545
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,720
I'm not coming out without him.

How are you feeling, buddy?

559
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,201
Can you get me out of here?

560
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,069
I'm kind of done
with being on my head.

561
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:49,073
The question is, what are
you doing on your head?

562
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,442
I wish it was a longer
and more interesting story.

563
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:54,292
AARON: I bet you do.
I bet you do.

564
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,482
Real story, it's gonna be
the one about

565
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,217
how we got you out of here.

566
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,985
[scoffs]

567
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,922
<i>SUSIE: John's body is too big
to just be pulled out.</i>

568
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,858
He's so deep, it's hard
to get any leverage.

569
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,494
It looks like when he went in,
he sucked in air

570
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,829
to squeeze in
where he's trapped.

571
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,231
So if we're going to get him out,
he's going to have to do it again

572
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,599
and push while we pull.

573
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,901
But there's a problem,
the tunnel bends

574
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,269
right against his back.

575
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,071
Meaning what?

576
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:24,921
Meaning we probably have
to break his legs to get him out.

577
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,278
JOHNI
That bad, huh?

578
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,047
AARON:
Eh, I've been a part of

579
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:32,550
a lot of search and rescues
that seem near impossible.

580
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,321
We'll figure this out, man,
no doubt in my mind.

581
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,681
JOHN:
Okay.

582
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:42,074
Here, you don't
need this fight now.

583
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,590
You're probably thirsty.

584
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,662

585
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,152
Got it. Thank you.

00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,621
Is that lemon?

587
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,623
I always wondered
who bought that awful ï¬‚avor,

588
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,458
and now I know it's
you search and rescue guys.

589
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,027
Hey, I didn't buy it, all right?

590
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,629
I get what you mean, though.
It's disgusting.

591
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,631
It takes like
dish soap or something.

592
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,399
But, hey,
when we get on the surface,

593
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,468
you get me a bigger budget,

594
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,070
I'll come get the other guys
with, I don't know,

It's okay.

Cleanliness is impossible
in a wild beauty like this one.

614

Besides, it's crazy with walls
getting soft and hard.

This is doing the same thing
and expecting a different result.

of insanity, right?

Brilliant.

The moisture's constantly working

It makes it both slick and soft.

on him and he'd just slip free.

696
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,376
It just doesn't always go that way.

JOHN:
You know, uh,

698
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:36,307
I could actually go for
some more Gatorade right now.

700
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,611
You sure it's not gonna
make matters worse?

701
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,414
That stuff really
isn't that bad anymore.

702
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,017
AARON: All right.
Hold on. Just a second.

703
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,985
All right.

705
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,021
Thank you.

You got it?

Got it.

708
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,392
Yeah, that stuff
really isn't that bad.

709
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:32,409
I used to think
it tasted like dish soap, but...

It's becoming my favorite.

715
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,680
I'm great, man.
-You good?

716

AARON: Hey, don't worry
about me, okay?

717
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,485
You just focus on breathing.

718
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,120
You just breathe.

719
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,480

Well, we've got
a little bit of time here.

722
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,107
Why don't you tell me
about yourself, John.

723
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,942
Where are you from?

724
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,478
Oh, and, uh, make sure
you take a deep breath

725
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,079
before you start talking.

726
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:25,082
I want you to breathe
slow and easy for now.

727
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,442
Slow and easy.

talk like that again.

We just don't need
to talk about it.

828
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,869
I'm pretty sure you get
to talk life and death

829
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,739
with people like me
all the time, right?

830

00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,477
To be honest with you, man,

833
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:29,213
I haven't really been into
the church thing for a while.

834
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:31,415
Really, any kind of church.

835
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,283
Just wasn't your thing or...

836
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:34,518
I don't know.

837
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:37,921
I'm just living my life
a day at a time,

838
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,291
just trying to do my job right,
help people.

839
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,894
They can learn about
all that life and death stuff

840
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,363
when they're on the surface,
when we're not involved.

841
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,966
So helping peopleÂ»

842
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,202
Look at that.

843
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,204
You believe
in something, right?

844
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,564
Yeah, sure.

845
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:06,316
I thought you were gonna start
preaching to me.

[chuckles]

847
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,923
No. To each their own.

848
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:15,125
It's fun to hear
other people's thoughts

849
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,027
on this stuff, though.

850
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:18,395
It probably sounds
lame to most,

851
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:22,443
but to be honest,
it makes me feel at peace.

852
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,203
Yeah, that's the reason

853
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:29,006
why we do all this
church stuff anyway, right?

854
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,508
To feel good?
-I guess so.

855
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:34,077
It'd probably be good if
more people treated it like that.

856
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,847
You know,
as long as you find

857
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,148
what makes you happy.

858
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,250
Yeah? I mean, that's kind of
the endless search

859
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,886
for everyone, it seems,
and every time...

860
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:44,922

Wow!

AARON: Look at you
sneaking that in on me.

863
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:54,064
Man, you want me
to save you first,

864
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:57,568
and then you can do
your rescue on me.

865
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:01,115
No, I'm just conversing, is all.

866
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:04,575
That was obviously...

867
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:09,008
They were suggestions,
so I'll be sticking you to it.

870
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,217
[drill rattling]

871
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,577
[drill rattling]

872
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:18,956
[grunts]

873
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:21,316
Come on!

874
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,161
[drill whirring in distance]

875
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,011
That sounds like it's going well.

876
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:29,591
Yeah, it better be.

877
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,535
So what brought you
down here anyways?

878
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:36,139
I mean, I'd assume
you're pretty used to caving.

879
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,474
What tipped you off?

880
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:40,210
Well, you're sporting some
fantastic vintage headlamps.

881
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:44,948
Besides, most people are
too afraid to get down this far.

882
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:48,715
I guess I could never
turn down an adventure.

883
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,022
That's probably
how I ended up in Virginia.

884
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:54,382
Really? What's in Virginia?

885
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:59,096
I'm going to school to be
a pediatric cardiologist.

886
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:03,200
Oh, so you're
working with kids?

887
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,369
Yeah.

888
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:08,005
Well, at least their hearts.
-Phew.

889
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:11,141
What made you want to do that?
Isn't that like 50 years of school?

890
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,501
JOHN:
Give or take.

891
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,605
My...

892
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,686
My sister, uh,

893
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,923
my younger sister had
heart surgery when she was four.

894
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,526
And I wanted to...

895
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,355
You know, it's sad.

896
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:42,339
You have to be on the edge
of losing everything

897
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,007
to really open your eyes

898
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:47,645
and... see the beauty
in the simple things.

899
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:54,146
Hey, I thought we weren't
gonna talk like that, John?

900
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:58,155
I've been studying
to be a doctor

901
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:01,024
the past few years, and...

902
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,460
I can hear my own breathing, man.

903
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,396
Yeah, I can't sugarcoat
things for you.

904
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,031
Obviously, John,
I know this is bad,

905
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:11,881
but you're gonna get
out of here, you have to.

906
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,470
I wish I could believe
any fib you could give me.

907
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,651
I don't want to die down here.

908
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:38,061
I told you
I can hear my breathing.

909
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:40,597
JOHN:
Please, just stop.

910
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:41,765
John, look at me.

911
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,767
Why didn't I spend
more time with my wife?

912
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:46,570
No, hey, John, look at me.
Listen, look at me!

913
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,930
Eyes on me, right here.

914
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:07,515
I believe you.

915
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:18,369
<i>[III]</i>

916
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,141
Such a John thing to do.

917
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,343
Always pushing himself
just a little too hard.

918
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:29,346
Well, that's why he's so strong.

919
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:32,349
And that's what's going
to get him through this.

920
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:36,353
He's gotten himself into some
crazy situations before, right?

921
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,555
Rock climbing, scuba diving.

922
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,390
Getting married?

923
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,526
Yeah, that's one
he's not getting out of.

924
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:44,795
I don't care how deep
of a hole he crawls down.

925
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,596
Yeah.

926
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,632
The guy on phone told me
there's already

927
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,368
a bunch of people there
working to get him out.

928
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:54,337
And as soon as I hung up,
I knew it was gonna be okay.

929
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:56,373
And I still know it.

930
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:57,774
They're getting him out.

931
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,843
Look, Em,
Pvejust been down there,

932
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,678
and I know how it is.

933
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:03,513
And I don't want
to take away hope.

934
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,382
He will, Josh, he will get out.

935
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:08,326
How do you know?
-Because...

936
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,449
Because he has to.

937
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:18,695
<i>AARON: All right,
you're obviously a stud.</i>

938
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:20,864
You're in med school,

939
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:25,135
which takes serious foresight
to make it work, let's be honest.

940
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:27,671
I bet that wife of yours

941
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,706
feels pretty lucky
that she snagged you, huh?

942
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:33,376
Uh-uh.
You got it backwards.

943
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,612
I had to win her over.

944
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,114
Yeah.

945
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,316
She made me fight for it.

946
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,828
Really?
Like a fight, huh?

947
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:44,354
Yeah.

948
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,456
I'd have preferred a fist fight.

949
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,693
It would have been less painful.

950
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:52,053
Easier on my heart. Heh.

951
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,801
Well...
Wait, wait, wait, you're going

952
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,436
to leave me hanging
right there'?

953
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,738
Come on.

954
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:03,273
You've got to tell me
about this girl

955
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:06,376
that completely owned you.

956
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:10,424
Oh, she is, uh...
She's everything.

957
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:16,553
It's one thing to find a girl

958
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,929
that who you want to marry.

959
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,226
And it's something
completely different

960
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:26,409
to find a girl
that you have to marry.

961
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,376
[John coughing]

962
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:33,094
Damn.

-EMILY: Hey!

964
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:56,273
You're gonna get yourself killed.

965
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:00,897
This is the first time I met you.

966
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:03,257
At a crosswalk.

967
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:04,534
I'm sorry?

968
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,269
We realized we were going
to same class together.

969
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,238
You're in O. Chem, too?

970
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:09,940
You must be
a glutton for punishment.

971
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,300
I'm John.

972
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:14,811
Emily.

973
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,213
Emily.

<i>JOHN: I immediately wished
I had something more to say</i>

a complete blank.</i>

976

[light chattering]

979
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:56,820
Hey, guys, I'm taking off.

980
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,288
Where are you going?

981
00:55:58,388 --> 00:55:59,990
Home.

982
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,692
Wow, Mr. "Let's pull
an all nighter" is leaving early.

983
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:05,428
A little distracted. I'm sorry.

984
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,788
See you at class.

I am so sorry.

988
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:24,347
Here, let me get those.

989
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:28,418
Is this like a normal thing
for you, running into things?

990
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,387
No, destiny did this.

991
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,989
I swear, I'm usually like
really... I'm nimble.

992
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:36,493
Yeah, for you, destiny's
kind of a jerk, if you ask me.

993
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:40,843
Taking away your grace,
throwing you at cars, at me.

994
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:42,565
Yeah, you've got
a serious issue

995
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:43,867
with that destiny guy,
too, I guess.

996
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:45,835
Taking away my nimble,

997
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:49,039
my ability to be nim...
and words.

998
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:53,009
<i>I'm a funny person, I swear
I am, but funny John was gone.</i>

<i>But! was determined
to make her laugh.</i>

1000
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:58,515
<i>Make the girl smile,
and you got a chance, right?</i>

1001
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,417
This is cool.

1002
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:02,085
Orange, that's...

1003
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:04,935

or something?

1004
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:08,625
<i>Yeah, 1 had no game
whatsoever.</i>

1005

<i>And then finally...</i>

1006
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:13,763
Wait, we're going fishing

1007
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:14,998
at midnight
at the Provo Golf Course,

1008
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,734
and you should... You'll love it,
you should totally come.

1009

<i>1 had no idea
where that came from.</i>

<i>We weren't going fishing.
I didn't even know who we was.</i>

<i>I'm 90% sure there's
no fish in any of the ponds</i>

<i>that we'd have
to trespass to get to.</i>

Really?

1014
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:31,081
Unfortunately, yeah.

1015
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:33,441
I'm soin.

1016
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,778
What?

00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,857
<i>1 pooled together the fastest
fake tradition ever.</i>

EMILY: This is crazy.
You guys do this all the time?

1019
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:46,062
Yeah, what else
are you gonna do

1020
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:47,530
in the middle
of the night in Provo?

1021
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,433
Actually, I kind of take you
as a bookworm.

1022
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:51,868
I'm pretty sure I've seen you

1023
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,070
somewhere in that library
every time I go.

1024
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,839
Wait, you've seen me before?

1025
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,141
Yeah, you're always there.
It's not like I could miss you.

1026
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,410
What was with this whole
destiny stuff then?

1027
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,845
This whole time you were tailing me.

1028
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:04,848
Okay, destiny, first off,
that's your word,

1029
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:07,851
and second, destiny for you
was a well-timed hit

1030
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,819
that nearly ruined
my research paper.

1031
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:11,888
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

1032
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,657
Anyways, now here we go.

1033
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:17,427
It is dark outside,
so be careful when you cast.

1034
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:18,795
Okay.
-Because...

1035
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,063
...you may hook somebody.

1036
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,498
All right, got it.

1037
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:25,068
So cast her and the hook
in the water, fight?

1038
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,670
Yeah. You've never
fished before, have you?

1039
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,940
No. Ha ha, but I've seen it
in the movies, so...

1040
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,509
Yeah, that's good enough.
-Okay.

1041
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:34,511
That's absolutely fine, so...
-All right.

Stop.
-I'm so sorry.

All right, let me slowly breathe.

1048
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:46,556
Okay, I'm sorry.
-Don't say sorry to me.

1049

said sorry to them.

I'm- I just...

1052
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:56,666
I don't like not knowing how
to do things, and this is just...

1053
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:58,868
"I don't not like not knowing
how to do things"?

1054
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,437
That's a fantastic
double negative.

1055
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,472
Yeah, uh...
-So, you're good at that.

1056
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,140
Can you just show me

1057
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,676
how to do this,
so I don't go nuts

1058
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:09,212

Well, yeah, I can.

on your technique,

1061

1062
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:16,820

It's four months,

1090

if I let you go again,

1127
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:10,126
then I won't get another
chance to marry you.

I never had
a feeling this strong.

1137
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:36,788

I'm sorry.

1139
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:45,085

Well, technically,

1143
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:01,244
she didn't really
say anything, I guess.

1144

What?

1145
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:05,181

that song for her,

1147
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,152

1148
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:11,287
Yeah.

a good voice, though.

No...

1151
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,394
It only makes sense,

1152
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:21,494

Just a minute.

1211

Can you...
Can you tell her I'm sorry?

1212
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:10,266
I shouldn't have
come down here.

I'm so sorry
to put her through this.

1214

Ems, I've told you everything
that was in my heart.

1312
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:01,223
And I knew
you had your doubts

1313

about me and about us and...

1314
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:08,397
I know just as long as I could
spend all the days I have

1315
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:10,866
on this earth with you,
then those days

1316
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:13,335
would be good days...
great days.

1317
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,838
They'd be great
because they would be ours.

1318
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,640
And I couldn't imagine
any future

1319
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:20,309
more wonderful
than one that had you in it.

the same way that I look...

-No, I have so much to say.

It didn'tfeel fight before, fight?
But it feels fight now.

01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,268
And marriage is a big thing.
It's a huge thing.

1330
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:48,571
And I can't just say yes
or I couldn't say yes.

1331

But I mean, I say yes now.

1332

And, okay,
I shouldn't have done that,

1333

just say something

out of this hole.

Hey, I don't have
a family like you, John.

1437
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:27,836
And what happened at Crandall Mines
a couple of years back,

1438
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:30,940
it just... just shook everybody.

1439
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:37,212
And to see families grow up
without a...

1440
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:42,017
without a dad, just...

1441
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:46,450
makes you start thinking,
"Well, why wasn't I there?"

1442
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:50,225
We lost three rescuers that day,
and they were good men.

1443
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:52,828
Really good men.

1444

Why did I live?

1445
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:01,837
Eventually, you just gotta go
into these situations

1446
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:07,819
and tell yourself,
"Well, if this is it, fine.

1447
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:13,445

and it's working for me."
