1
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,338
The average European consumes 28 pigs in his life

2
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:44,691
160,000 liters of petroleum, 700,000 kWh hours of energy

3
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,293
and 1,5 million liters of water.

4
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,571
He produces 900 tons of CO2 and is partially responsible

5
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,337
for cutting down 1,800 hectares of rainforest.

6
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,051
And for one child dying of starvation.

7
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,529
Most people know that, but forget about it

8
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,776
because they have to go to work or pick up their kid from daycare.

9
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,255
And some think about it for too long.

10
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,018
And then they have the choice to either kill themselves

11
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,575
or go completely mental.

12
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,215
Do you know those numbers by heart?

13
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,735
I calculated them at some point.

14
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,939
Well, this is Jule's room, she moved out a week ago

15
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,653
and, well, the mattress is mine.

16
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,179
Great. -Do you need anything else?

17
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,016
I think I'll take a walk.

18
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,051
Pick up some hot Berlin chicks, huh?

19
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,730
No, just getting some fresh air.

20
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,777
It's really great to see you.

21
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,175
Have you ...Have you heard from Sarah at all lately?

22
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,332
Okay.

23
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,130
I'll go to sleep. -Night.

24
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,298
Do we know each other?

25
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,888
No, don't think so.

26
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,930
Then why are you staring at me?

27
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,297
I thought I knew you from somewhere. - I see.

28
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,179
Did you just get back from vacation?

29
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,099
Why?

30
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,177
You look like someone who just got back from vacation.

31
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,970
I livee by the sea, maybe that's why.

32
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,813
I see.

33
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,210
What happened to your eye?

34
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,253
Beat up.

35
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,853
Who?

36
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,213
Guys in Moscow.

37
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,729
And what do you do in Moscow?

38
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,091
My grandma lives there.

39
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,818
I visited her.

40
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,251
I met those guys in a park.

41
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,171
We started chatting. They were quite nice actually.

42
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,053
They wanted to play cards with me and drink vodka.

43
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,208
We drank quite a lot.

44
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,139
Then one of them invited me over to his place,

45
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,776
in one of those residential highrises.

46
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,577
We kept on drinking there.

47
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,209
I think they wanted to get me drunk.

48
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,614
Well, and then I woke up in the elevator.

49
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,733
Blood on my face and no pants on.

50
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,973
No wallet, keys, cell.

51
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,219
Sick.

52
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,576
Do you know your way around here?

53
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,453
Why? You look like someone who'd know.

54
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,252
No, I'm just visiting.

55
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,012
Who are you v1siting? -A friend.

56
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,338
And where's your girlfriend now?

57
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,092
She's not my girlfriend.

58
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,688
Just a friend.

59
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,371
Why did you follow me earlier?

60
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,690
I thought you were one of those guys who stalk people.

61
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,377
Ever done it with a guy?

62
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,970
No. You?

63
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,378
I...

64
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,849
I had a girlfriend once but...

65
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,856
that didn't work out somehow.

66
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,020
I have a son. -Really?

67
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,459
David.

68
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,572
How old is he?

69
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,338
Four months.

70
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,855
Sick.

71
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,336
Do you think he'll be like me?

72
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,811
I mean, it's possible, right? That he'll turn out the same?

73
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,133
Yes, maybe.

74
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,131
where is he now?

75
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,691
With Anne.

76
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,776
They don't live here.

77
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,972
Guess it's better that way.

78
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,093
Sometimes I l1sit them,

79
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,175
but she doesn't want me there somehow.

80
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,972
Why not?

81
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,173
Her idea of a man is different.

82
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,459
Hallesches Tor, transfer to U6 and bus lines,

83
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,576
exit to the right.

84
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,978
Well, I have to get off at the next stop.

85
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,535
I have a couple more to go.

86
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:14,816
Well, if you want, we can meet up tomorrow or something.

87
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,100
Yeah, sure.

88
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,579
Yeah, sure.

89
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,816
I don't know, in the evening?

90
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,171
We can talk on the phone. -Yes.

91
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,615
Give me your number.

92
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,413
0153...

93
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,777
76 89...

94
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,378
042...Marla

95
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,337
Marlo ...

96
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,252
Kirill

97
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,977
Well then, see you tomorrow. -See you.

98
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,736
And then he sits there, eyes open wide and asks me why?

99
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,532
And I say: the light hits the water with an angle and then it refracts.

100
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,498
Yes, but why... -Well that's .. .

101
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,972
Wait, and then I find this physics book and that's exactly what it says.

102
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,849
The light refracts and the refraction index and that's it.

103
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,369
I don't remember having learned it any different.

104
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,809
So what did you tell him? -I said I'd look it up at home.

105
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,654
Now I've got this smart mechanical engineer here with me

106
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,010
and I'm sure he'll explain it to me, right?

107
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,013
Well...

108
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,448
The light is a wave. Look, like this.

109
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,492
And if the wave hits another medium,

110
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,452
then the part that hits it first

111
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,732
moves either faster or slower.

112
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,536
Depending on the concentration of the medium.

113
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,493
Because light always chooses the fastest way. So ...

114
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,692
Yes, but why? -What "why"?

115
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,252
Well, why does it always choose the fastest way?

116
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,139
No idea.

117
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,211
Can you pass the zucchini?

118
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,530
Just tell him the thing about the waves and

119
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,699
make it sound more complicated, then he won't ask anymore.

120
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,256
But I can't lie to him. -That's no lie.

121
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,139
I mean...

122
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:40,616
Scientifically speaking it is correct. -Scientifically ...

123
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,690
So what did you end up doing yesterday?

124
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,895
Well, I went for a walk.

125
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:03,014
And then I saw the sunrise at Warschauer Bridge.

126
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,456
So you were out for quite some time.

127
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,419
Yes.

128
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,250
You don't have to tell me anything...

129
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,096
Yes, well, I met someone.

130
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,173
In the street or what?

131
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,498
Yes, on the bridge. -At sunrise?

132
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,296
Yes. -And what's her name?

133
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,332
Kirill

134
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,818
Yes...

135
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,008
Oh, hi!

136
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,411
Hi -Hi!

137
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,931
That's my dad. This is Marlo.

138
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,452
Hello. -Hello.

139
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,739
He could give us a ride.

140
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,457
Didn't we want to walk?

141
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,135
Yes, but if there's a ride.

142
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,890
Okay, fine. Let's go.

143
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,730
You want the main entrance?

144
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,978
Yes, right? -Yes.

145
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,975
Maybe we just have to walk around it.

146
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,572
It looks pretty creepy.

147
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,412
The Nazi's built it.

148
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,009
German megalomania in stone.

149
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,817
I'm sure you could build huge airships in there.

150
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,251
And then fly over Berlin.

151
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,690
Yes, maybe.

152
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,212
By the way, your glasses look like shit.

153
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,699
They are my dad's. -I see.

154
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,571
Because of the black eye.

155
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,453
Your dad and you, you don't talk much, right?

156
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,256
No, never have.

157
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,771
Why did he come here?

158
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,452
See if I'm still alive.

159
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,333
Did you notice the way he looked at you?

160
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,537
Yes.

161
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,769
He wanted to look inside your head.

162
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,255
Why would he want to do that?

163
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,813
So he can read your thoughts and control you.

164
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,696
You're nuts!

165
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,579
If one person jumped off the TV tower every 30 seconds,

166
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,375
it would take 3 years ...

167
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,291
for all Berliners.

168
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,655
Why would they jump off?

169
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,810
Don't know. Just because.

170
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,338
where do you study?

171
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,977
College, in L¨¹beck.

172
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,052
Is that by the sea?

173
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,336
Well, you can ride the bike there.

174
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,451
I could -. I'll be with you.

175
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,378
Then we can hang out by the sea together.

176
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,978
Do you want kids some day?

177
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,258
No idea.

178
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,816
Anne says he looks just like me.

179
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,732
Just smaller.

180
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,819
Little David,

181
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,616
big Kirill.

182
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,215
When did you last see him?

183
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,818
Before I went to Russia.

184
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,498
But I think he didn't want to see me somehow.

185
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,856
Why?

186
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,770
I dreamt a group of lesbians stalked me.

187
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,338
They whipped me.

188
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,130
First they chained me, then they whipped me.

189
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,339
One after the other.

190
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,092
Why lesbians?

191
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,778
I don't know.

192
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,898
They were wearing those strange leather suits.

193
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,172
And felt very important.

194
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,380
Have you ever dreamt something like that before?

195
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,578
No.

196
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,652
Hi.

197
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,489
What are you doing here? -I work here.

198
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,212
I see.

199
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:23,252
So that's your Russian guy? -Seems like it.

200
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:27,454
Well, I didn't want to disturb you. -No problem.

201
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,249
I guess I'll get going then ...

202
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,814
Okay, then...

203
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,411
See you around.

204
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,853
Have fun, you two. Bye.

205
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,135
Was that your girlfriend?

206
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,738
Friend. Yes.

207
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,491
Looks nice.

208
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,688
Yes, she does.

209
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,611
Sociology?

210
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,653
Yes.

211
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,335
I can even still play some chords.

212
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,532
You lured me here with spaghetti.

213
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,859
Yes.

214
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,249
Guess I ate it already.

215
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,216
I have Nutella and toast.

216
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,051
Does everyone have their own shelf?

217
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,218
Yes.

218
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:17,811
Your roommates... don't happen to have spaghetti?

219
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,419
Don't know.

220
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,334
But it wouldn't be okay for me to eat it anyways.

221
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,217
I could live off Nutella and toast actually.

222
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,409
I guess I feel like taking a shower now.

223
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,698
You could stand on the roof.

224
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,413
Really? Now?

225
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,858
Sure, why not?

226
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,854
Can you pass the shampoo? -Yes.

227
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,973
Wait...

228
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,369
I'll do your hair.

229
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,296
I think it's too short.

230
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,494
Maybe it'll work better with yours.

231
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,458
Hello...

232
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,650
where are you now?

233
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,778
Do you want me to go?

234
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,658
Hi.

235
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,458
I'm at the bakery.

236
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,012
Eating something.

237
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,773
There's only Nutella at your place ...

238
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,173
Okay.

239
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,338
I can bring something for you.

240
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,533
Okay, see you.

241
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,491
Hey.

242
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,219
Hi.

243
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,178
What are you doing?

244
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,213
I'm looking for something.

245
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,537
Here, this is what I meant.

246
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:56,774
Ford Mondeo wagon, 97, red.

247
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,492
That was our family car.

248
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:08,217
Her father gave it to us when she was pregnant.

249
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,336
I flipped the thing over.

250
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,818
On a dirt road.

251
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,817
What do you mean, "flipped it over"?

252
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,857
I climbed out of the window.

253
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,737
Didn't have a scratch on me.

254
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,458
And then?

255
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,458
I hitchhiked to Berlin.

256
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,173
And the car?

257
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,259
Shit

258
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,699
Is that for me?

259
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,218
Want some?

260
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:01,131
No, I already had some.

261
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:43,494
My father said the police towed the thing.

262
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,894
And her dad wants my dad to pay now.

263
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,815
But it was a gift, right?

264
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:33,695
There's this guy recently who sings on my voicemail.

265
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:36,775
Wanna hear it?

266
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,336
That's you...

267
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,455
Isn't it?

268
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:13,410
Why do you sing on your own voicemail?

269
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,172
Hello?

270
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:04,296
Can you talk to me and look at me?

271
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:26,851
Do you want to lick my ass?

272
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:32,376
What? -lick my ass.
