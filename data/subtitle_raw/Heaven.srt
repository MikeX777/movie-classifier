2
00:00:43,094 --> 00:00:45,629
Daddy, wake up.

3
00:00:54,038 --> 00:00:55,072
Daddy, wake up.

4
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:03,547
Come on, come on.

5
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,414
One, two, three.

6
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:05,082
One,

7
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:05,950
two,

8
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,484
three, four, five.

9
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:08,953
Come on, wake up.

10
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,623
Did you see the
track marks on her?

11
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:15,525
Nothing?

12
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:16,560
No pulse.

13
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:18,095
All right, I got it.

14
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:19,030
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Okay.

15
00:01:19,063 --> 00:01:19,931
All right.

16
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:22,699
Ready, clear.

17
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:27,404
No pulse.

18
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:29,774
Clear.

19
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:32,742
Still no pulse.

20
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:35,112
Come on, come on.

21
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:36,113
Call it.

22
00:01:36,147 --> 00:01:37,514
No, no, no.

23
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:38,149
No, let's just do
it one more time.

24
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,851
All right.

25
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:40,751
Clear.

26
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:44,155
All right, here we go.

27
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:49,459
- Quick.
- Yes.

28
00:01:49,492 --> 00:01:50,594
Yeah.

29
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:51,695
We got a pulse.

30
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:52,696
Okay.

31
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:53,865
We got a pulse.

32
00:01:53,898 --> 00:01:55,066
- We got a pulse.
- All right, all right.

33
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,033
That's what I'm
talking about, okay.

34
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:57,168
Up high, man.

35
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,035
All right.

36
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:00,637
Okay.

37
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:31,836
Get off me.

38
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:34,105
Look at her feet.

39
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:37,975
Sir, you cannot call
EMT for swollen feet.

40
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:39,542
Make sure to get
her to the doctor

41
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,711
to get them checked, okay.

42
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:49,519
Oh my god.

43
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:50,187
Ricky.

44
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:52,223
My son, is he okay?

45
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,590
No, how is he?

46
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,960
He's okay.

47
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:57,527
Okay.

48
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:08,538
Jonathan.

49
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:09,472
Hey Tim.

50
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:11,075
Quiet tonight, huh.

51
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,044
God's smiling down
on his children.

52
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:14,211
Yeah.

53
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:15,445
Here you go.

54
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:20,184
May God bless you sir.

55
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:21,218
You have a nice evening.

56
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:23,220
All right.

57
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:28,225
Night's getting
interesting already.

58
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:29,961
You need to hydrate, bruh.

59
00:03:29,994 --> 00:03:30,828
Oh, thanks.

60
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:32,797
Too much coffee, man.

61
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:37,835
You look happy.

62
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:41,238
Eh, nah, it's just
my usual face, man.

63
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:42,739
Oh yeah.

64
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:45,176
So, did you talk to her?

65
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:46,844
Who?

66
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:48,578
You know who, Francesca.

67
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:49,880
Oh.

68
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:52,716
I mean, I said, hi, you know.

69
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:54,718
She heard me this time.

70
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:57,654
Did she say hi back?

71
00:03:58,756 --> 00:03:59,622
Yep.

72
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:03,094
That's pretty good.

73
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:04,728
It's only taken you
what, six months?

74
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:06,831
Hey, I'm working on it, man.

75
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:07,832
- Relax.
- Sure, sure.

76
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:09,033
- Relax.
- Sure.

77
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:10,001
I just need a
little more time.

78
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:10,667
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right.

79
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,268
Hey.

80
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:12,502
Got a light?

81
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:16,639
Are you serious?

82
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,276
Yeah, bad for
my health, right?

83
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,948
Man.

84
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:29,186
I don't know, sometimes man,

85
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,621
it's just doesn't
make any sense.

86
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:32,622
What?

87
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:33,924
Idiots like her?

88
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,894
I don't know.

89
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,764
That's crazy, man.

90
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:42,665
Yeah.

91
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,101
I mean,

92
00:04:44,135 --> 00:04:45,002
look,

93
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,305
I guess the only way
I can make sense of it

94
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:50,174
is to believe that
there's something more

95
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,575
beyond this life, man.

96
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:56,280
I mean, this can't
be all there is bro.

97
00:04:56,313 --> 00:04:59,682
God's got a much
bigger plan, trust me.

98
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:03,287
Yeah, what, like Heaven?

99
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,090
Yeah.

100
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:07,958
Heaven.

101
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:14,731
It's gotta be better than this.

102
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:17,535
I hope so.

103
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:21,138
Me too, man.

104
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:23,573
Me too.

105
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:26,911
Daddy,

106
00:05:26,944 --> 00:05:28,379
time to wake up.

107
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,280
Wake up.

108
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:38,122
Who is that?

109
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,194
Where am I?

110
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:49,266
Wake up!

111
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:57,228
Honey.

112
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:58,929
Sorry.

113
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:00,764
My hospital appointment.

114
00:08:00,798 --> 00:08:03,033
Oh, oh, yeah, okay.

115
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,935
All right, here we go.

116
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:08,372
Oh man, I hate
this piece of junk.

117
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,140
Hey now, hey stop.

118
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,378
Don't be hating on old Betsy.

119
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,080
Betsy?

120
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:17,248
Yeah, Betsy, her name.

121
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:18,949
Don't you remember?

122
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:24,521
Since when did Betsy
become the official name

123
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:26,090
of this old truck?

124
00:08:26,123 --> 00:08:27,391
It's official.

125
00:08:28,826 --> 00:08:32,029
Pops had her as long
as I can remember.

126
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,799
Until he gave her to us.

127
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:37,868
And here,

128
00:08:39,036 --> 00:08:41,038
yep, there it is.

129
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:43,007
She's got her trusty roadmap.

130
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,907
Yeah.

131
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,911
I think it's time for change.

132
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,513
We can't afford a new car.

133
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:52,082
No, no, you can get a great
new lease at the moment.

134
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,984
You know, no money
down and drive away.

135
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:54,985
It's great.

136
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,020
Great.

137
00:08:56,053 --> 00:08:56,920
- Get me a new truck...
- Great,

138
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:57,888
add that to our mortgage

139
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:00,858
and our insurance and copay.

140
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:01,859
Oh.

141
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:03,160
Wait.

142
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:04,061
See, see.

143
00:09:04,995 --> 00:09:06,130
There you go.

144
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:07,498
She's a reliable old broad.

145
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:08,399
Good job.

146
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:11,302
What?

147
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:12,303
Don't say it.

148
00:09:12,336 --> 00:09:13,304
Don't say it.

149
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:14,471
I know you're going to say it.

150
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:15,572
I wasn't going to
say just like you.

151
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:16,540
Ugh.

152
00:09:16,573 --> 00:09:18,809
But you are a reliable.

153
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:21,312
It's the truth, truth.

154
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:22,946
And you are old,

155
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:26,116
old soul, I should
say, old soul.

156
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,984
Okay.

157
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:28,285
Okay, oh, old soul.

158
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,387
Put your seat.

159
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:32,956
I don't know, it's really old.

160
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,091
I think it's cool,

161
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:35,926
it's got personality.

162
00:09:37,094 --> 00:09:38,429
Yeah.

163
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:41,332
Old Betsy is very
reliable, isn't she?

164
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:43,267
Betsy, is that what
you call her pops?

165
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,935
- Yeah.
- Betsy.

166
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:46,370
Do you like her?

167
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,474
You're going to need that.

168
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,475
What, need, what?

169
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,444
The roadmap.

170
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:56,313
Oh no, see they have
these things called GPS now.

171
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:57,548
It's a, it's pretty new,

172
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:59,550
but much more reliable
than a map, so.

173
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,218
Hmm.

174
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:04,888
Not more liable
than that road map.

175
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:06,357
He's talking about the Bible.

176
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,025
Oh yeah.

177
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:09,493
Does this have maps on it?

178
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,362
I mean, I guess if we
were in the middle east,

179
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:12,529
it'd be pretty useful.

180
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:18,235
It's a map to God, Jonathan.

181
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:19,470
Okay, yeah.

182
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:22,439
Well I'm not really into
that sort of stuff, so.

183
00:10:22,473 --> 00:10:24,475
Well, all I can say is

184
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:27,478
I'll do a deal with you.

185
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:28,612
Okay?

186
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:30,247
Yeah, now we're talking.

187
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,384
Well, you may not like it, but

188
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:34,618
I will give you

189
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:37,254
this truck for free.

190
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:38,422
Free?

191
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,391
Wait, really pops?

192
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:42,659
On one condition.

193
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:43,560
Okay.

194
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:47,965
You leave the roadmap

195
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:51,535
in the glove box, just in
case you need it one day.

196
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:55,506
Cause you can't always
rely on the PGSs, SPGs.

197
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:56,373
GPS.

198
00:10:57,307 --> 00:10:58,142
That.

199
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,309
- Yeah.
- Right.

200
00:11:01,378 --> 00:11:05,249
I know may seem like
a lot of nonsense.

201
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:09,052
Some stories that had no
relevance to you right now.

202
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,021
But I was just like you

203
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:15,993
and a time came in my
life when I was lost.

204
00:11:16,026 --> 00:11:18,695
And if it wasn't
for that roadmap,

205
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:23,167
I would never have been found.

206
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,507
Okay.

207
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:32,543
It's staying.

208
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:38,582
But, but wait,

209
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,051
don't you mean you
wouldn't have found it

210
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:44,388
because like how
could a map find you?

211
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:45,289
It's.

212
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:47,991
Yeah, you'll see.

213
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:56,633
You'll understand later.

214
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,035
You'll understand later.

215
00:11:58,068 --> 00:11:59,436
- I'll see.
- Okay.

216
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:19,423
Well,

217
00:12:20,524 --> 00:12:22,593
the doctor seems
positive about this,

218
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:23,627
this round.

219
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,396
Yeah, well we'll see.

220
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,266
No, I think this is
the one that's gonna,

221
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,134
this is the one that's
going to do it, you know.

222
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:45,282
It's the 12th today.

223
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:48,452
I thought,

224
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:51,789
I thought you weren't
gonna remember that,

225
00:12:51,823 --> 00:12:53,090
you know, with
everything going on.

226
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:54,124
No.

227
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:55,325
I never forget.

228
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:06,503
You look tired.

229
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:07,371
Oh.

230
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:10,140
I am.

231
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:12,743
No, I mean, not just today.

232
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:14,177
I mean, for the last few months

233
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,814
you've been looking tired.

234
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:17,681
Yeah,

235
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,383
It's all,

236
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,251
night shift work and stuff.

237
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:22,586
Yeah, it's ever since they
put you on graveyard shift.

238
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:23,487
Yeah.

239
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,424
Well it's more money, so.

240
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:35,833
I don't think you
should work there anymore.

241
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:36,733
Well,

242
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:38,836
I can't,

243
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,572
I can't just change
jobs, you know.

244
00:13:43,173 --> 00:13:45,275
Well, you could,

245
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:48,278
you could find a different
job in the same department.

246
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,180
You said there's
that manager position

247
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:52,149
that they were
opening up, right?

248
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:53,350
Normal hours.

249
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:54,518
Normal shifts.

250
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:58,722
You wouldn't walk around
like a zombie vampire.

251
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:01,391
Thanks.

252
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:02,292
Yeah.

253
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:05,763
Yeah, no look, it's,

254
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:06,864
they just get really weird

255
00:14:06,898 --> 00:14:08,800
when you try to change things

256
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:09,666
when you ask for new positions...

257
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,768
Jonathan.

258
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:13,871
You don't know, unless you ask.

259
00:14:13,905 --> 00:14:15,907
I mean, I didn't know if you
wanted to go on a date with me

260
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,908
until I asked.

261
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:18,910
I had a plan.

262
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:20,310
I was working on it.

263
00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:21,846
Yeah, yeah, you had a plan.

264
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,815
And it all fell through
at the last minute.

265
00:14:23,848 --> 00:14:24,681
Okay.

266
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:27,217
Well you procrastinate.

267
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,619
You get stuck in that,

268
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:30,253
that head of yours

269
00:14:31,388 --> 00:14:33,523
and just overthink things.

270
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:38,629
Oh, I think
you're running late.

271
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:41,899
See, sometimes it's
good to over think.

272
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,201
Okay.

273
00:14:45,736 --> 00:14:48,806
Do you want me to come in?

274
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,173
No.

275
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:51,608
I want you to go home
and get some rest.

276
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:52,509
Okay.

277
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,447
Just give it a push.

278
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:58,482
Give it a push,
know how it works.

279
00:14:58,515 --> 00:14:59,716
I know Betsy.

280
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:02,519
See, I know.

281
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:05,255
I'm gonna get
that boulder out.

282
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:06,623
I've got a plan.

283
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,258
You know what
your plan should be,

284
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,726
to get some help.

285
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:12,429
Oh, don't forget.

286
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:14,832
Okay.

287
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:16,533
- I got it.
- Yeah.

288
00:15:29,981 --> 00:15:33,951
I know it's not
the ideal situation.

289
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:36,921
It would be worse to
try and do this now.

290
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:38,790
I still don't have a job

291
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:40,290
and you just lost yours.

292
00:15:40,323 --> 00:15:42,359
Your brother said we
could stay with him.

293
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:43,293
Yeah.

294
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:44,361
You know how he is?

295
00:15:44,394 --> 00:15:45,997
He's super religious.

296
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,397
No, he's not.

297
00:15:47,431 --> 00:15:48,298
He's.

298
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:54,504
He's got faith in
something bigger than this.

299
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,408
I think that's a good thing.

300
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:01,578
But you're not religious.

301
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:02,814
And you always said

302
00:16:02,847 --> 00:16:04,548
you didn't want to turn
out like your parents.

303
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,349
Like if God was real,

304
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:11,688
why would there be so much
suffering in this world?

305
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:18,896
But how does that determine
whether there's a God or not?

306
00:16:19,797 --> 00:16:21,231
I don't know.

307
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:23,768
It just does.

308
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,370
I don't know.

309
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,009
I thought I knew.

310
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:36,881
I guess I don't.

311
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:37,782
It just,

312
00:16:40,985 --> 00:16:42,854
it doesn't feel right.

313
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:49,392
Elizabeth,

314
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:52,395
what options do we have?

315
00:17:08,813 --> 00:17:12,349
Hey, do you want me
to come in with you?

316
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:18,655
No.

317
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:16,113
Hey, I need to talk
to Elizabeth Spencer.

318
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:17,447
I'm sorry, sir.

319
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,515
We cannot give out
personal information.

320
00:18:18,548 --> 00:18:20,550
No, I need to talk to her.

321
00:18:20,584 --> 00:18:21,518
Sir.

322
00:18:21,551 --> 00:18:25,056
You need to leave or
we will call security.

323
00:18:52,183 --> 00:18:53,050
Did you?

324
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,939
This is just so

325
00:19:16,774 --> 00:19:17,641
wow.

326
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,448
Do you know where I am?

327
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:27,885
Of course I do.

328
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,154
Yeah,

329
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:31,756
where am I?

330
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:33,523
You know.

331
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:36,193
No, I really don't
know where I am.

332
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:37,560
Yes, you do.

333
00:19:38,963 --> 00:19:39,830
I do?

334
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:44,769
Is this,

335
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:47,805
is this heaven?

336
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:49,840
I told you would know.

337
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:53,177
Whoa.

338
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:56,613
There must be some mistake.

339
00:19:56,646 --> 00:19:58,249
I shouldn't be here.

340
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,482
I had so much more to do...

341
00:19:59,516 --> 00:20:00,684
Forget what is behind

342
00:20:00,717 --> 00:20:02,485
and look to what is ahead.

343
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:03,154
Yeah.

344
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:05,089
No, no, no, no, no.

345
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,523
I mean, I was never any good.

346
00:20:06,556 --> 00:20:07,758
I failed at everything.

347
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:08,993
I was terrible with my faith.

348
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:10,227
I never went to church.

349
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:12,029
I was hopeless at my job.

350
00:20:12,063 --> 00:20:12,964
I mean surely.

351
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:16,767
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

352
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:18,568
Jonathan, you're not dressed.

353
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:19,569
What?

354
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:20,704
Church.

355
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:21,906
Church, you remember
that, don't you?

356
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:23,673
I got the game on.

357
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:27,278
Oh, come on, come on,
we have to go to church.

358
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:30,714
Pastor Steve asked us to go
to lunch at his house after.

359
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:32,283
I have have nothing
in common with that guy.

360
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,750
Well, you have
one thing in common.

361
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:34,617
Yeah?

362
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:35,585
Yeah, Jesus.

363
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:38,588
He likes to talk about Jesus.

364
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:40,024
Yeah.

365
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:41,759
No, I mean, seriously, you,

366
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:43,127
you have all those questions.

367
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,562
This is a great opportunity
to get them answered.

368
00:20:45,595 --> 00:20:46,730
So when you're
trying to, you know,

369
00:20:46,764 --> 00:20:48,966
act really intelligent
at small group.

370
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,135
What do you mean trying to?

371
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,003
Come on,

372
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,005
come on.

373
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:56,107
DVR the game, let's go.

374
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,741
Can you at least
leave the pie?

375
00:20:57,775 --> 00:20:59,609
No, you're not to eat it all.

376
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:01,879
Yeah, but last time
I only got one slice.

377
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:02,880
That's good.

378
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:04,115
Your doctor would be happy.

379
00:21:04,148 --> 00:21:06,616
That's just code
for saying I'm fat.

380
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:07,284
All right,

381
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,888
okay, let's do it.

382
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,265
Hi Elizabeth.

383
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:22,867
This is Dr. Howard.

384
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,169
Could you please call me
back as soon as possible?

385
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:26,070
Thank you.

386
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:32,575
The most important thing

387
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:34,045
was that in all the doubts,

388
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:36,013
fears, worries,

389
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:38,249
and all the times you
stumbled and fell,

390
00:21:38,282 --> 00:21:40,051
you still believed.

391
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:41,684
It's always about the heart.

392
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,620
Even at the lowest point,

393
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:45,256
you still believed.

394
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:46,723
It's on the inside,

395
00:21:46,757 --> 00:21:48,826
not what's on the outside.

396
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:50,261
Only man looks at that.

397
00:21:50,294 --> 00:21:52,163
But God looks at this.

398
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:56,699
Huh.

399
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,070
I still have a pulse.

400
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:01,138
You have a lot to learn.

401
00:22:01,172 --> 00:22:04,041
But we have all of
eternity to learn.

402
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:06,743
Aren't we supposed to
be wearing like robes

403
00:22:06,777 --> 00:22:09,113
and have wings and halos?

404
00:22:09,146 --> 00:22:11,949
Should I be playing
a harp or something?

405
00:22:11,982 --> 00:22:12,749
Oh, wait.

406
00:22:50,921 --> 00:22:52,056
Jonathan,

407
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:53,991
Pastor Steve was
asking about my pie.

408
00:22:54,024 --> 00:22:55,392
It's, the recipe is my mom's.

409
00:22:55,426 --> 00:22:56,861
It's really.

410
00:22:56,894 --> 00:22:59,729
Wow, that looks amazing.

411
00:22:59,763 --> 00:23:00,630
Try it.

412
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:03,934
That's incredible.

413
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:05,369
The pie's amazing.

414
00:23:05,402 --> 00:23:07,171
It's hands down the best pie
I've ever had, Elizabeth.

415
00:23:07,204 --> 00:23:09,039
Why, thank you, Pastor Steve.

416
00:23:09,073 --> 00:23:11,375
Just call me Steve.

417
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:13,410
Well, thanks Steve.

418
00:23:13,444 --> 00:23:15,012
Jonathan, you wanna have some,

419
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:16,380
it's really delicious.

420
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:18,816
Of course you know that.

421
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:20,017
Yeah, I do.

422
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,254
Oh, Jonathan's
watching his weight.

423
00:23:23,287 --> 00:23:24,155
Oh yes.

424
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:25,990
Good idea.

425
00:23:27,124 --> 00:23:29,293
I've been watching
my weight for years.

426
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:30,761
Still never changes though.

427
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:58,122
Guys, guys,

428
00:23:58,155 --> 00:23:59,790
Bora Bora this time of the year,

429
00:23:59,823 --> 00:24:00,958
Amazing.

430
00:24:00,991 --> 00:24:01,959
I just got back.

431
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:04,061
It is beautiful.

432
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:04,929
All right.

433
00:24:04,962 --> 00:24:07,164
What do you think?

434
00:24:07,198 --> 00:24:08,165
She's a beast.

435
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:09,466
Hey, check it out, check it out.

436
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,868
Come on.

437
00:24:13,003 --> 00:24:14,305
Yeah, come in here.

438
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:18,275
Check out that cool
leather interior, smell it.

439
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,879
You know, I can get
you a great deal

440
00:24:21,912 --> 00:24:22,780
on one of these bad boys.

441
00:24:22,813 --> 00:24:23,948
Yeah?

442
00:24:23,981 --> 00:24:26,350
Come on down to the
showroom tomorrow.

443
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,185
Honey.

444
00:24:28,219 --> 00:24:30,221
Yeah, yeah, I'll be a minute.

445
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:31,989
You're wife is
gonna love this.

446
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:52,042
So what did Peter want?

447
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:53,444
Who?

448
00:24:53,477 --> 00:24:55,145
Peter Lock, you know, you
were just talking to him.

449
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:56,347
He goes to our church.

450
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,348
Oh.

451
00:24:57,381 --> 00:24:59,116
I don't, just stuff.

452
00:25:00,884 --> 00:25:03,520
Did you like his truck?

453
00:25:03,554 --> 00:25:04,555
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

454
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:05,956
It's pretty cool.

455
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,458
It's kind of like a
smart truck, you know,

456
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:08,459
it's like a smart house

457
00:25:08,492 --> 00:25:09,994
and it's got all these
kind of cool features.

458
00:25:10,027 --> 00:25:11,862
How much is the lease?

459
00:25:11,895 --> 00:25:13,297
Oh,

460
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,566
he said he's got this
great deal on the loan.

461
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,469
So come on down the
showroom and yeah.

462
00:25:18,502 --> 00:25:19,937
- Yeah.
- Jonathan,

463
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,838
okay.

464
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:23,907
Look as much as I think
you look really hot

465
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:25,976
inside of the truck,

466
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,077
the thing is,

467
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:31,148
I just, you're going
to sign the lease

468
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:34,051
and then you're
going to be stuck.

469
00:25:35,286 --> 00:25:36,253
Yes.

470
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:38,088
It's like you won't,

471
00:25:38,122 --> 00:25:39,556
you're not going to
get out of the cycle.

472
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,959
It's just a lease, that's all.

473
00:25:41,992 --> 00:25:42,960
No, it's not the lease.

474
00:25:42,993 --> 00:25:45,429
It's your work, it's your work.

475
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,931
Our bills are gonna pile up.

476
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:50,301
And this is not
the right time for,

477
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:51,468
I mean, because what it means

478
00:25:51,502 --> 00:25:53,270
is that you're not
going to be available

479
00:25:53,304 --> 00:25:55,039
to make any changes.

480
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:56,440
And you're already working a job

481
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,976
that completely exhausts you.

482
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:00,311
I mean, you'll have a truck.

483
00:26:00,344 --> 00:26:01,312
That would be great.

484
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:02,946
You have a truck,

485
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,982
but you'll have to take on
more shifts to pay for it.

486
00:26:05,015 --> 00:26:07,918
And you're already burning
the candle at both ends.

487
00:26:07,951 --> 00:26:10,120
A truck is not going
to make you feel good

488
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:13,190
when you're working on these
night shifts all the time.

489
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:15,192
Why are you being so
negative all the time?

490
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:16,160
What do you mean?

491
00:26:16,193 --> 00:26:18,128
I'm not being negative.

492
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,497
This is,

493
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:24,234
this is not just a truck for me.

494
00:26:24,268 --> 00:26:25,469
This is for both of us.

495
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:27,938
I know, I know
it's not the truck.

496
00:26:27,971 --> 00:26:28,939
It's your job.

497
00:26:28,972 --> 00:26:30,474
I want you to be
able to be free,

498
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:34,278
to be able to make changes
in your life for your job.

499
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:35,913
I can't just make changes.

500
00:26:35,946 --> 00:26:37,114
I keep telling you that.

501
00:26:37,147 --> 00:26:38,649
They don't like it when
you ask for new shifts

502
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:40,517
and new changes
and all this stuff.

503
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:41,952
You just think I can do that.

504
00:26:41,985 --> 00:26:42,953
I can't just do that.

505
00:26:42,986 --> 00:26:44,188
I have to get out.

506
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:45,322
I have to get out of here.

507
00:26:45,356 --> 00:26:46,890
Come on.

508
00:26:46,924 --> 00:26:47,524
You can't just run away every
time we have an argument,

509
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:48,926
you have to run away.

510
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:49,626
It's not that, I
just have to get out.

511
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,494
I have to get out.

512
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:51,428
I'm hurting.

513
00:26:51,462 --> 00:26:53,330
I, I just need some fresh air.

514
00:26:53,364 --> 00:26:54,565
I need to just,

515
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:57,968
I just need some fresh air.

516
00:26:58,001 --> 00:26:59,036
Okay.

517
00:26:59,069 --> 00:26:59,937
Okay.

518
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:03,907
- Okay.
- You okay?

519
00:27:03,941 --> 00:27:05,242
Oh, I just need
some fresh air.

520
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:06,477
I just need,

521
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,644
I just need my,

522
00:27:07,678 --> 00:27:08,979
hold on, hold on.

523
00:27:09,012 --> 00:27:10,948
Are you having a panic attack?

524
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:11,982
Yeah, maybe.

525
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:12,683
Maybe.

526
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:13,984
- Just breathe.
- Okay.

527
00:27:14,017 --> 00:27:14,885
Okay.

528
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,087
Oh, okay.

529
00:27:18,155 --> 00:27:19,022
Okay.

530
00:27:19,957 --> 00:27:20,591
Okay.

531
00:27:20,624 --> 00:27:21,592
Okay.

532
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:22,493
Okay.

533
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,197
Did you,

534
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:30,434
do you ever get the results
back from the doctor?

535
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:31,602
No, not yet.

536
00:27:34,371 --> 00:27:37,174
I'm sure it's
going to be okay.

537
00:27:39,676 --> 00:27:41,645
And if it's not?

538
00:27:41,678 --> 00:27:43,680
It's going to be fine.

539
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:46,150
Okay, but,

540
00:27:48,652 --> 00:27:50,120
but if it's not,

541
00:27:52,356 --> 00:27:55,325
you just promise me
to leave the job.

542
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,994
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

543
00:27:57,027 --> 00:27:58,695
Really?

544
00:27:58,729 --> 00:28:00,330
Yeah, I promise.

545
00:28:01,365 --> 00:28:02,433
Okay.

546
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:03,333
- I feel better now.
- Good.

547
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:04,234
Okay.

548
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:07,738
All right.

549
00:28:07,772 --> 00:28:09,039
Now we need to
stop by the store.

550
00:28:09,072 --> 00:28:10,407
Okay, what for?

551
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:12,342
I need to get
some ingredients.

552
00:28:12,376 --> 00:28:13,444
I'm going to make a pie.

553
00:28:13,477 --> 00:28:14,344
For who?

554
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,014
For you, weirdo.

555
00:28:17,047 --> 00:28:18,582
Yeah, for you.

556
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,684
Okay, that sounds good.

557
00:28:24,756 --> 00:28:28,325
So how long have
I been here for?

558
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:30,160
Time is an old
fashioned thing now.

559
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:32,329
You're on eternity time.

560
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:33,230
Oh.

561
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:35,767
Is that like dog years?

562
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,401
You know, like one year up here

563
00:28:37,434 --> 00:28:38,735
is seven years in earth?

564
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,471
More like a thousand
years is like a day,

565
00:28:40,504 --> 00:28:42,606
and a day is like
a thousand years.

566
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:43,507
Oh.

567
00:28:45,576 --> 00:28:46,443
So,

568
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:49,680
how did I get here?

569
00:28:49,713 --> 00:28:50,647
You know.

570
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:53,417
I do?

571
00:28:58,522 --> 00:28:59,523
Okay.

572
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:40,564
Yep, gonna need the old roadmap.

573
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,242
Okay, honey, you win.

574
00:29:56,246 --> 00:29:57,648
Time for a change.

575
00:29:59,182 --> 00:30:00,050
Yeah.

576
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:02,787
All right.

577
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:14,464
All right, okay.

578
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:57,775
It just, I feel so different.

579
00:31:01,345 --> 00:31:03,714
It's hard to explain.

580
00:31:03,747 --> 00:31:04,748
I know.

581
00:31:04,782 --> 00:31:06,249
You used to worry a lot.

582
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:08,652
Now you will never worry again.

583
00:31:08,685 --> 00:31:09,854
You used to carry

584
00:31:09,887 --> 00:31:12,522
the weight of the
world on you everyday.

585
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:16,593
That boulder of worry and
fear crushed you constantly.

586
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:21,164
And now you will never worry
about that burden again.

587
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:23,734
Yeah.

588
00:31:23,768 --> 00:31:25,435
I feel so peaceful.

589
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,638
And no more fears
and no more tears.

590
00:31:27,671 --> 00:31:29,373
It all gets wiped away.

591
00:31:29,406 --> 00:31:34,411
All those years of pain and
suffering are all gone now.

592
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,480
It's amazing.

593
00:31:52,696 --> 00:31:55,699
Hey, they said you
wanted to talk to me.

594
00:31:55,732 --> 00:31:58,301
Yes, Elizabeth, take a seat.

595
00:32:06,276 --> 00:32:07,310
I thought we
were going to start

596
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:09,914
another round of
treatment today.

597
00:32:11,281 --> 00:32:12,616
That was correct.

598
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:13,450
But.

599
00:32:17,955 --> 00:32:19,222
What is it?

600
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:23,694
I'm afraid it's not good news.

601
00:32:23,727 --> 00:32:24,862
The test came back

602
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:27,230
and we're at a stage four.

603
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:30,001
At this point,

604
00:32:30,034 --> 00:32:31,568
the plan is to make sure

605
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:34,604
you're as comfortable
as you can be.

606
00:32:40,277 --> 00:32:42,279
Hey, don't be sad.

607
00:32:42,312 --> 00:32:43,680
Huh?

608
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:44,748
God's got it.

609
00:32:46,349 --> 00:32:47,952
Don't worry.

610
00:33:16,047 --> 00:33:16,914
Okay.

611
00:33:19,516 --> 00:33:21,919
Okay, God, maybe you got this.

612
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:28,625
I don't,

613
00:33:32,395 --> 00:33:33,497
I don't know.

614
00:33:34,966 --> 00:33:36,266
I don't know.

615
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,436
I can only handle so much, God.

616
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:41,471
It's just getting too much.

617
00:33:41,505 --> 00:33:42,774
This too much.

618
00:33:57,855 --> 00:33:58,722
Okay.

619
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,528
Okay, so I made a mistake.

620
00:34:04,561 --> 00:34:06,063
Maybe I deserve it.

621
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:14,939
Okay.

622
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,706
Okay.

623
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:20,544
God, I gotta, I need you so bad.

624
00:34:20,577 --> 00:34:21,545
I need you.

625
00:34:23,014 --> 00:34:25,615
Just help me, help me believe.

626
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:27,350
Help me.

627
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:31,488
Help me see beyond this, God.

628
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:35,793
Oh God, I just need
your peace, God.

629
00:34:35,827 --> 00:34:39,030
Please, please just
give me your peace.

630
00:34:41,531 --> 00:34:42,399
Please.

631
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:51,541
Okay.

632
00:34:51,575 --> 00:34:52,442
Okay.

633
00:34:53,476 --> 00:34:54,344
Okay.

634
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:09,559
Come here.

635
00:35:44,195 --> 00:35:45,062
I'm sorry.

636
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:47,697
I lost track of time.

637
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:49,066
Oh, you found my phone.

638
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,001
Thanks.

639
00:35:50,034 --> 00:35:51,668
I took an Uber.

640
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:52,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

641
00:35:52,904 --> 00:35:54,071
Yeah.

642
00:35:54,105 --> 00:35:56,640
Jonathan, you know I
don't ask for a lot.

643
00:35:56,673 --> 00:35:58,776
I just ask for you
to be there for me.

644
00:35:58,809 --> 00:35:59,777
I know.

645
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,710
I don't care about this house.

646
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:01,745
I don't care about the yard.

647
00:36:01,779 --> 00:36:02,947
I don't care about any of it.

648
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,614
I just want you to
be there for me.

649
00:36:04,648 --> 00:36:05,615
Yeah, I am.

650
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:08,019
I never see you anymore!

651
00:36:08,052 --> 00:36:10,855
Ever since they put you on
that stupid night shift,

652
00:36:10,888 --> 00:36:11,856
it's not good for you.

653
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:12,857
It's not good for me.

654
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,891
It's not good for either of us.

655
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:15,059
All right.

656
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:16,994
Look, I just need
some more time.

657
00:36:17,028 --> 00:36:18,595
Chuck just said
another six months,

658
00:36:18,628 --> 00:36:21,198
I could get a promotion
and I can get enough money

659
00:36:21,232 --> 00:36:22,233
to fix this house up.

660
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:23,566
Isn't that what you want?

661
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,567
Is that what you want from me?

662
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:25,602
That's why I'm doing this.

663
00:36:25,635 --> 00:36:27,504
I'm doing this for us.

664
00:36:32,843 --> 00:36:35,212
I don't have any more time.

665
00:36:38,182 --> 00:36:39,716
It's not working.

666
00:36:45,923 --> 00:36:46,991
No, no, no.

667
00:36:49,026 --> 00:36:49,860
It's gonna work.

668
00:36:49,894 --> 00:36:50,761
No.

669
00:36:54,531 --> 00:36:55,833
Oh.

670
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:16,220
Jonathan?

671
00:37:16,253 --> 00:37:17,554
Jonathan.

672
00:37:17,587 --> 00:37:19,023
Tim?

673
00:37:19,056 --> 00:37:19,890
It's me.

674
00:37:19,924 --> 00:37:20,758
I.

675
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:21,792
Oh my gosh.

676
00:37:21,826 --> 00:37:22,827
You're here.

677
00:37:24,128 --> 00:37:25,129
I can't,

678
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:25,997
I can't believe it.

679
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,564
I mean,

680
00:37:27,597 --> 00:37:29,000
you looks so happy and healthy.

681
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:30,801
I mean, you always happy,

682
00:37:30,835 --> 00:37:32,003
which I could never
quite understand.

683
00:37:32,036 --> 00:37:33,503
Well, I always

684
00:37:35,773 --> 00:37:36,941
just tried

685
00:37:36,974 --> 00:37:38,641
to hold on to the
hope that one day,

686
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:40,744
no matter what happened,

687
00:37:40,778 --> 00:37:42,113
I would be here in paradise.

688
00:37:42,146 --> 00:37:43,747
Things were bad sometimes.

689
00:37:43,781 --> 00:37:44,982
I mean they were,

690
00:37:45,016 --> 00:37:47,818
but I could believe
that I would be here

691
00:37:47,852 --> 00:37:49,186
in paradise.

692
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,087
And I am.

693
00:37:54,925 --> 00:37:56,093
That's my family.

694
00:37:56,127 --> 00:37:57,627
You never met them.

695
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,929
- No.
- Yeah.

696
00:38:00,097 --> 00:38:01,032
I lost them

697
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,034
early on,

698
00:38:04,301 --> 00:38:06,569
early on in a house fire.

699
00:38:07,271 --> 00:38:09,606
That's why I was homeless.

700
00:38:11,008 --> 00:38:13,244
See, I was a big,
successful lawyer,

701
00:38:13,277 --> 00:38:14,211
a big shot.

702
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:17,547
I thought I had it all.

703
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,919
I didn't have anything.

704
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,587
Traveling, always
away from them.

705
00:38:24,621 --> 00:38:27,058
And then one day I got a call.

706
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:28,225
It's all gone.

707
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:32,229
It crushed me.

708
00:38:35,966 --> 00:38:37,600
You're supposed to be
happy in Heaven, right?

709
00:38:37,634 --> 00:38:39,303
But just the thought of that,

710
00:38:39,336 --> 00:38:41,272
that crushed me.

711
00:38:41,305 --> 00:38:43,040
I could never get up

712
00:38:44,175 --> 00:38:46,777
because I was a self-made man.

713
00:38:47,812 --> 00:38:49,847
I didn't need anybody's help.

714
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,015
You know that.

715
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,652
It wasn't until I hit bottom

716
00:38:58,655 --> 00:38:59,990
and I reached out

717
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:03,894
and I asked for God's help.

718
00:39:05,396 --> 00:39:07,865
And he showed me this place.

719
00:39:09,033 --> 00:39:12,136
And he showed me my
family living here.

720
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,939
It was in a dream.

721
00:39:15,873 --> 00:39:17,241
It was in a dream.

722
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:20,411
The craziest thing in the
world in a dream and I,

723
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:23,280
I just held on to that every day

724
00:39:23,314 --> 00:39:25,116
and every night.

725
00:39:25,149 --> 00:39:26,217
Now I'm here.

726
00:39:27,218 --> 00:39:28,953
I followed His word.

727
00:39:30,788 --> 00:39:33,190
It's, it's so funny, I mean,

728
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:37,027
I always thought you were
the crazy homeless guy.

729
00:39:37,061 --> 00:39:38,728
I was pretty crazy.

730
00:39:41,031 --> 00:39:42,632
But you weren't.

731
00:39:44,835 --> 00:39:46,971
You're the one who's wise.

732
00:39:48,005 --> 00:39:48,939
You saw this place.

733
00:39:48,973 --> 00:39:49,974
You have peace.

734
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:51,674
I never had that.

735
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,210
I was too busy like everybody
else trying to get it,

736
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:55,880
trying to make it work,

737
00:39:55,913 --> 00:39:57,214
working, making money,

738
00:39:57,248 --> 00:39:58,949
try to put it all together,

739
00:39:58,983 --> 00:40:01,185
hold it in my own hands.

740
00:40:01,218 --> 00:40:02,887
But you let it all.

741
00:40:03,888 --> 00:40:05,022
You trusted God

742
00:40:05,055 --> 00:40:07,224
cause you saw this place.

743
00:40:07,258 --> 00:40:08,159
You were the wise one.

744
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,327
You have peace, I have had that.

745
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:13,831
We all have a different road
that God gives us, you know.

746
00:40:13,864 --> 00:40:15,966
Mine was different.

747
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,235
They all lead to one place,

748
00:40:18,269 --> 00:40:19,136
to Him.

749
00:40:20,404 --> 00:40:22,739
You gotta meet my family.

750
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,281
- Hey.
- Hey.

751
00:40:32,149 --> 00:40:33,150
Ooh, thanks.

752
00:40:34,285 --> 00:40:36,020
You got anything stronger?

753
00:40:36,053 --> 00:40:37,388
Stronger than root beer?

754
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:39,056
Yeah, yeah, a little bit.

755
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:42,059
I'm sorry man, I don't drink.

756
00:40:42,092 --> 00:40:43,460
Oh, right.

757
00:40:43,494 --> 00:40:46,263
Because of your religion.

758
00:40:46,297 --> 00:40:47,998
No.

759
00:40:48,032 --> 00:40:50,834
It's just that I
used to drink a lot.

760
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:51,969
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

761
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:57,241
But then after I found religion,
as you like to call it,

762
00:40:57,274 --> 00:40:59,810
I just lost the taste for it.

763
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,847
I guess that's a good thing.

764
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:05,249
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

765
00:41:05,282 --> 00:41:07,384
You're gonna have a spare
room while you're here.

766
00:41:07,418 --> 00:41:08,852
Oh yeah.

767
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:10,087
Thanks.

768
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,488
It's not going to be
for long, you know,

769
00:41:11,522 --> 00:41:12,957
it's just until

770
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:16,927
this all blows over with
Elizabeth and you know.

771
00:41:20,864 --> 00:41:21,765
Talk about eye sores.

772
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:22,967
It's not that bad.

773
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,934
No, that,

774
00:41:24,868 --> 00:41:26,303
that is really bad.

775
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:30,174
Well, look, I was
actually wondering

776
00:41:30,207 --> 00:41:33,177
if you might be interested
in buying it off me.

777
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,245
Oh, what, the boulder?

778
00:41:34,278 --> 00:41:35,512
No, no,

779
00:41:35,546 --> 00:41:36,413
the house.

780
00:41:37,948 --> 00:41:39,550
Look, it's just that I
don't need a place this big.

781
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:41,285
I'm traveling so much these days

782
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:44,521
and you might want to
be marrying Elizabeth

783
00:41:44,555 --> 00:41:47,191
hopefully sooner than later.

784
00:41:47,224 --> 00:41:49,360
I don't know, this is like
the right kind of place

785
00:41:49,393 --> 00:41:50,527
to have kids, settle down.

786
00:41:50,561 --> 00:41:52,830
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down on that.

787
00:41:52,863 --> 00:41:53,497
Okay.

788
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,531
All right.

789
00:41:54,565 --> 00:41:55,399
Just think about it.

790
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:56,400
Okay.

791
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:59,169
I'd make you a great deal.

792
00:41:59,203 --> 00:42:02,273
So, what are you doing again?

793
00:42:02,306 --> 00:42:04,241
Mercy ships.

794
00:42:04,275 --> 00:42:05,409
It's aid work.

795
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:06,310
I manage medical teams.

796
00:42:06,343 --> 00:42:07,578
Oh yeah.

797
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:09,079
That's cool.

798
00:42:09,113 --> 00:42:10,114
What are you studying to be?

799
00:42:10,147 --> 00:42:10,981
An EMT?

800
00:42:12,116 --> 00:42:13,050
Yeah.

801
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:15,352
No, I'm still working on that.

802
00:42:15,386 --> 00:42:17,421
That's great, man.

803
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:18,455
That's good.

804
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:20,824
So listen,

805
00:42:20,858 --> 00:42:24,995
I was planning on going
to a small group thing

806
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:26,163
with the church tonight.

807
00:42:26,196 --> 00:42:27,998
You all want to come?

808
00:42:30,334 --> 00:42:31,902
No, dude.

809
00:42:31,935 --> 00:42:34,305
You know, I'm not into all
that religious stuff, like.

810
00:42:34,338 --> 00:42:36,173
Right, right, right.

811
00:42:36,206 --> 00:42:38,309
Cause you got your
life all together

812
00:42:38,342 --> 00:42:40,811
and everything's going well.

813
00:42:42,613 --> 00:42:43,614
I'm kidding man.

814
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:44,982
Come on, come on down

815
00:42:45,015 --> 00:42:46,483
and see all the crazy
religious freaks.

816
00:42:46,517 --> 00:42:47,918
That'd be a good time.

817
00:42:47,951 --> 00:42:49,053
Oh my gosh.

818
00:42:50,954 --> 00:42:51,822
Bro, fine.

819
00:42:53,023 --> 00:42:54,491
Hey, there we go.

820
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,595
I mean what else
am I going to do?

821
00:42:58,629 --> 00:43:00,197
Great question.

822
00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:04,168
Oh yeah.

823
00:43:04,201 --> 00:43:07,271
Lots of crazy religious freaks.

824
00:43:07,304 --> 00:43:08,872
We can all make mistakes.

825
00:43:08,906 --> 00:43:11,275
As men, we tend to lead first

826
00:43:11,308 --> 00:43:12,609
and ask questions later.

827
00:43:12,643 --> 00:43:14,378
And sometimes this
can be a good thing.

828
00:43:14,411 --> 00:43:16,413
Sometimes it can be bad.

829
00:43:17,915 --> 00:43:19,083
If we make the wrong decision,

830
00:43:19,116 --> 00:43:21,251
we end up hurting
those around us.

831
00:43:21,285 --> 00:43:24,421
Our wives, friends,
kids, girlfriends,

832
00:43:25,522 --> 00:43:28,258
and then guilt
can weigh us down.

833
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,129
And if we're not careful,

834
00:43:32,162 --> 00:43:34,598
that guilt will lead us right
back to the same decision

835
00:43:34,631 --> 00:43:37,134
that got us there
in the first place.

836
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:40,371
Now we may choose to
live in that guilt

837
00:43:40,404 --> 00:43:41,271
in a cave,

838
00:43:42,606 --> 00:43:45,909
hidden where we once used
to lead out on the horizon.

839
00:43:45,943 --> 00:43:48,612
As man if left to
our own devices,

840
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:53,150
we'll stay in that cave for
as long as we possibly can.

841
00:43:53,183 --> 00:43:55,085
Heck we even set
them up in our homes

842
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,121
and call them man caves.

843
00:43:59,656 --> 00:44:02,393
If we choose to
live in those caves,

844
00:44:02,426 --> 00:44:03,293
in guilt,

845
00:44:04,495 --> 00:44:07,264
we're in the darkness, lost.

846
00:44:07,297 --> 00:44:10,134
And as we crawl deeper
and deeper into that cave,

847
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:13,203
we need a lamp to guide us out.

848
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:16,306
Jesus says he is a
lamp unto our feet.

849
00:44:17,474 --> 00:44:18,675
We must follow that lamp

850
00:44:18,709 --> 00:44:22,379
to lead us out of guilt
and fear and shame.

851
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,216
Jesus wants us to live lives

852
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,451
that go beyond,

853
00:44:27,484 --> 00:44:29,486
into eternity in heaven.

854
00:44:30,721 --> 00:44:34,525
He wants us to live our
lives to the fullest.

855
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:36,960
Do children go there,

856
00:44:36,994 --> 00:44:38,295
like to heaven?

857
00:44:38,328 --> 00:44:40,531
I mean like, like little kids,

858
00:44:40,564 --> 00:44:42,032
you know babies.

859
00:44:43,634 --> 00:44:45,169
Yes, of course.

860
00:44:47,204 --> 00:44:51,575
Do you mean when a child
dies in a miscarriage?

861
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:53,343
No, the other one.

862
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:56,447
Yes, Jonathan.

863
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,716
That is the beauty of
eternity with Christ.

864
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:04,021
That when you die, you
live forever in heaven.

865
00:45:04,054 --> 00:45:04,756
In paradise.

866
00:45:12,529 --> 00:45:14,998
Hey, I just need to
get some air real quick.

867
00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:39,523
Hey, what's wrong?

868
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,496
I made a mistake and,

869
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:47,698
look, I tried to stop it,

870
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:49,333
but it was my fault

871
00:45:49,366 --> 00:45:50,701
and I, look I, I.

872
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:55,239
Hey, it's okay.

873
00:45:55,272 --> 00:45:56,139
It's okay.

874
00:45:57,775 --> 00:46:01,745
This is what forgiveness
is all about.

875
00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:04,214
You can start over again.

876
00:46:04,248 --> 00:46:05,649
Yeah?

877
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:07,584
That's what I did.

878
00:46:07,618 --> 00:46:09,119
So can you.

879
00:46:09,152 --> 00:46:10,654
Man, after she left me,

880
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,758
she didn't just go to her
parents' house for awhile.

881
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:15,559
She left me for good.

882
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:21,298
I broke her heart

883
00:46:22,432 --> 00:46:24,701
and I made her do
that horrible thing.

884
00:46:24,735 --> 00:46:28,205
And I can't forgive
myself for that.

885
00:46:28,238 --> 00:46:29,239
It's okay.

886
00:46:30,474 --> 00:46:32,075
It's not over yet.

887
00:46:34,344 --> 00:46:35,212
Yeah.

888
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,181
It's not over yet.

889
00:46:41,318 --> 00:46:42,185
Yeah.

890
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,388
Yeah.

891
00:46:51,261 --> 00:46:52,729
God, if you're real

892
00:46:54,698 --> 00:46:57,467
and you are who
they say you are,

893
00:47:00,137 --> 00:47:04,541
then I'm praying now that
you give me a second chance.

894
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:06,677
Please.

895
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,464
I'm sorry.

896
00:47:27,497 --> 00:47:32,135
I was wrong and I never
should've pushed you into it.

897
00:47:32,169 --> 00:47:32,804
It's too late.

898
00:47:32,837 --> 00:47:34,438
No, no it's not.

899
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,541
If you're talking about us,

900
00:47:37,574 --> 00:47:39,643
then yeah, it's too late.

901
00:47:40,544 --> 00:47:42,880
I was talking about Rachel.

902
00:48:01,498 --> 00:48:03,233
See, I thought it was too
late too, but it's not true.

903
00:48:03,266 --> 00:48:04,668
It's not too late.

904
00:48:11,408 --> 00:48:12,877
Because I believe

905
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:15,178
that we will see her again

906
00:48:15,947 --> 00:48:16,814
in Heaven.

907
00:48:20,517 --> 00:48:22,619
But you don't
believe in Heaven

908
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:24,521
No, I do, I do now.

909
00:48:24,554 --> 00:48:27,925
And I know that you
have for so long

910
00:48:27,959 --> 00:48:31,328
and I'm sorry that
I never did, but

911
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:32,229
tonight I

912
00:48:33,831 --> 00:48:38,301
am a crazy religious person,
just like my brother.

913
00:48:38,335 --> 00:48:39,202
Really?

914
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:41,204
I'm sorry.

915
00:48:52,582 --> 00:48:53,851
I forgive you.

916
00:48:55,452 --> 00:48:58,255
I can't wait to
see Rachel again.

917
00:48:59,924 --> 00:49:01,324
Yeah, me too.

918
00:49:07,932 --> 00:49:10,534
Hey wait, where are you going?

919
00:49:11,936 --> 00:49:14,471
I'm staying with my parents.

920
00:49:16,473 --> 00:49:19,309
Since you, we are
Christians now,

921
00:49:20,477 --> 00:49:22,746
we can't be living together.

922
00:49:24,281 --> 00:49:26,283
Not until we're married.

923
00:49:28,685 --> 00:49:30,320
You sure about that?

924
00:49:30,353 --> 00:49:30,988
Don't.

925
00:49:31,022 --> 00:49:31,889
Okay.

926
00:49:31,923 --> 00:49:33,490
Okay, all right.

927
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:36,259
So,

928
00:49:38,029 --> 00:49:39,629
when you're ready,

929
00:49:40,898 --> 00:49:41,766
come back.

930
00:49:52,043 --> 00:49:53,343
Okay, then.

931
00:49:54,979 --> 00:49:56,313
Let's do this.

932
00:50:11,763 --> 00:50:13,363
You need to go down there.

933
00:50:13,396 --> 00:50:16,433
There's someone that
wants to meet you.

934
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,555
Welcome home, Daddy.

935
00:51:11,588 --> 00:51:12,455
Rachel.

936
00:51:13,423 --> 00:51:14,324
My daughter.

937
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:20,430
I've been waiting
for you and this moment

938
00:51:20,463 --> 00:51:22,499
for a long time.

939
00:51:22,532 --> 00:51:23,835
Time to come out of the dark.

940
00:51:23,868 --> 00:51:26,369
I have someone else
I want you to meet.

941
00:51:26,403 --> 00:51:27,872
Let's keep going, Daddy.

942
00:51:27,905 --> 00:51:29,040
Death is no more.

943
00:51:29,073 --> 00:51:30,808
Daddy, it's no more.

944
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,035
Hi Jonathan.

945
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:06,643
Hey.

946
00:52:19,991 --> 00:52:21,125
How are you?

947
00:52:28,132 --> 00:52:30,600
Actually, I feel terrible.

948
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,808
I really miss my hair.

949
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:43,513
I miss feeling healthy.

950
00:52:45,649 --> 00:52:48,085
And I just miss being with you.

951
00:52:50,553 --> 00:52:51,521
With me?

952
00:52:51,554 --> 00:52:52,522
Yeah.

953
00:52:52,555 --> 00:52:54,524
How crazy is that?

954
00:53:06,703 --> 00:53:07,939
Hey Jonathan.

955
00:53:07,972 --> 00:53:08,806
Yeah?

956
00:53:10,207 --> 00:53:11,708
I was thinking.

957
00:53:13,244 --> 00:53:14,577
Do you remember

958
00:53:15,846 --> 00:53:17,647
before we got married

959
00:53:18,816 --> 00:53:20,151
what you told me?

960
00:53:23,087 --> 00:53:27,457
You said that one day we
will see our Rachel again.

961
00:53:30,261 --> 00:53:31,996
Remember, in Heaven?

962
00:53:44,741 --> 00:53:46,777
I want you to know

963
00:53:46,811 --> 00:53:49,746
even though I feel
really terrible,

964
00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:57,554
I just feel, I just feel
like this peace around me.

965
00:53:57,587 --> 00:53:58,688
I can't explain it.

966
00:53:58,722 --> 00:53:59,589
It's like,

967
00:54:01,624 --> 00:54:03,094
it's like a warmth.

968
00:54:04,627 --> 00:54:06,596
It's just all over my body.

969
00:54:06,629 --> 00:54:07,497
Like I,

970
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,102
I can just feel God.

971
00:54:11,135 --> 00:54:12,702
I can feel His presence.

972
00:54:12,736 --> 00:54:14,772
I know it's gonna be okay.

973
00:54:15,806 --> 00:54:18,009
I know He's got this.

974
00:54:22,645 --> 00:54:23,513
Jonathan,

975
00:54:27,885 --> 00:54:31,088
even though I'm going
away for a while,

976
00:54:35,026 --> 00:54:38,595
we're also gonna
see each other again

977
00:54:38,628 --> 00:54:39,629
really soon.

978
00:54:51,976 --> 00:54:53,110
This next part

979
00:54:54,912 --> 00:54:56,113
of the journey,

980
00:54:58,681 --> 00:55:00,117
that's the good part.

981
00:55:11,661 --> 00:55:14,065
There's no more pain.

982
00:55:14,098 --> 00:55:15,933
There's no more tears,

983
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:19,602
and no more suffering,

984
00:55:20,838 --> 00:55:22,039
no more sorrow,

985
00:55:25,642 --> 00:55:26,977
no more sickness,

986
00:55:29,246 --> 00:55:30,580
no more death,

987
00:55:32,383 --> 00:55:34,151
no more evil,

988
00:55:34,185 --> 00:55:35,652
no more sadness.

989
00:55:38,389 --> 00:55:41,591
All of our tears
will be wiped away.

990
00:55:42,692 --> 00:55:44,862
The old things are no more.

991
00:55:47,064 --> 00:55:48,999
The day has dawned.

992
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:04,882
Come on daddy, hurry up.

993
00:56:39,783 --> 00:56:40,717
Jonathan.

994
00:56:44,054 --> 00:56:47,424
I was remembering when
I married you two,

995
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:49,293
you basically eloped.

996
00:56:50,928 --> 00:56:52,263
I was so nervous.

997
00:56:53,397 --> 00:56:56,934
It was my first
marriage ceremony, but

998
00:56:56,967 --> 00:56:59,236
I knew then she was special.

999
00:57:02,006 --> 00:57:03,207
I know I can't do much to help.

1000
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,108
And

1001
00:57:05,809 --> 00:57:09,313
I know Elizabeth is
still your whole world.

1002
00:57:10,447 --> 00:57:12,316
And I know that right
now you must feel

1003
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:15,718
like you cannot carry
home without her.

1004
00:57:18,822 --> 00:57:23,027
Heaven is God's answered
from the broken hearted.

1005
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,929
There's always hope.

1006
00:57:24,962 --> 00:57:26,363
It's not over yet.

1007
00:57:41,278 --> 00:57:44,048
So sorry, I was in
the middle of Africa

1008
00:57:44,081 --> 00:57:45,950
and I tried to get her
as fast as I could.

1009
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,785
I, I just couldn't.

1010
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:49,887
There was no flights.

1011
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,921
It's okay.

1012
00:57:52,323 --> 00:57:53,924
You're my brother.

1013
00:57:55,059 --> 00:57:58,262
You'll walk through
fire to get to me, so.

1014
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,464
It's okay.

1015
00:58:00,497 --> 00:58:01,365
John, I,

1016
00:58:03,867 --> 00:58:05,002
I am so sorry.

1017
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,008
Liz was amazing.

1018
00:58:21,151 --> 00:58:22,519
Jonathan,

1019
00:58:22,553 --> 00:58:25,756
how are you coping
with all of this?

1020
00:58:30,894 --> 00:58:32,196
I'm okay.

1021
00:58:32,229 --> 00:58:34,265
I know that's what we say,

1022
00:58:34,298 --> 00:58:36,066
but that's not
always how we feel.

1023
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,369
I mean, how are you doing?

1024
00:58:38,402 --> 00:58:42,206
People don't really
care about how I feel.

1025
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:45,242
No one really cares about that.

1026
00:58:45,276 --> 00:58:46,210
It's like in my job,

1027
00:58:46,243 --> 00:58:49,880
people just want to be
told that it's okay.

1028
00:58:49,913 --> 00:58:51,315
Everything's okay.

1029
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,551
I don't know.

1030
00:58:58,422 --> 00:58:59,356
Jonathan,

1031
00:59:00,391 --> 00:59:01,925
say how you feel.

1032
00:59:03,227 --> 00:59:06,263
If you won't say it to
me, then say it to God.

1033
00:59:06,297 --> 00:59:08,265
Tell Him how you feel.

1034
00:59:14,204 --> 00:59:15,806
It is okay to hurt.

1035
00:59:19,209 --> 00:59:21,345
It's okay to grieve, okay.

1036
00:59:25,316 --> 00:59:27,151
That's more than okay.

1037
00:59:27,184 --> 00:59:29,353
That's what makes us human.

1038
00:59:30,287 --> 00:59:31,455
We're not machines.

1039
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:33,957
We're flesh and we're blood.

1040
00:59:35,592 --> 00:59:38,195
When we lose someone, we hurt.

1041
00:59:41,231 --> 00:59:44,101
Sometimes that
hurt can take years

1042
00:59:46,603 --> 00:59:47,471
and

1043
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:52,843
sometimes they never heal.

1044
00:59:56,146 --> 00:59:57,981
It's with us forever.

1045
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:10,427
I can stay here if that
will help, if you like.

1046
01:00:12,396 --> 01:00:13,263
I just,

1047
01:00:14,565 --> 01:00:18,168
please just tell me
what you need from me.

1048
01:00:21,405 --> 01:00:22,272
I just,

1049
01:00:25,609 --> 01:00:28,145
I just want to be left alone.

1050
01:00:31,048 --> 01:00:31,982
That's all.

1051
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:07,317
I want you gone!

1052
01:01:08,685 --> 01:01:09,686
I

1053
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:10,687
want

1054
01:01:10,721 --> 01:01:11,688
you

1055
01:01:11,722 --> 01:01:13,023
gone!

1056
01:01:13,056 --> 01:01:15,025
Why won't you move?

1057
01:01:22,132 --> 01:01:23,000
Why?

1058
01:01:45,289 --> 01:01:47,090
Here, daddy.

1059
01:02:00,671 --> 01:02:03,740
You see the track
marks on her arm?

1060
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:06,677
Come on.

1061
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:08,278
Stay with us, stay with us.

1062
01:02:08,312 --> 01:02:09,513
Not today.

1063
01:02:09,546 --> 01:02:10,414
One,

1064
01:02:10,447 --> 01:02:11,281
two,

1065
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:12,249
three,

1066
01:02:12,282 --> 01:02:13,250
four,

1067
01:02:13,283 --> 01:02:14,117
five.

1068
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:17,087
Come on now.

1069
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,388
Don't die on me.

1070
01:02:22,059 --> 01:02:23,494
Come on.

1071
01:02:23,527 --> 01:02:25,496
- All right.
- No pulse.

1072
01:02:25,529 --> 01:02:26,530
All right.

1073
01:02:26,563 --> 01:02:27,431
Clear.

1074
01:02:30,234 --> 01:02:31,635
No pulse.

1075
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:33,136
One more time.

1076
01:02:34,204 --> 01:02:35,038
Clear.

1077
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:38,642
Oh, come on, come on.

1078
01:02:38,675 --> 01:02:40,210
Still no pulse.

1079
01:02:42,279 --> 01:02:44,381
All right, give
it one more shot.

1080
01:02:44,414 --> 01:02:46,216
One more time.

1081
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:47,117
Clear.

1082
01:02:55,292 --> 01:02:56,693
Call it.

1083
01:02:59,363 --> 01:03:00,230
3:45.

1084
01:03:04,635 --> 01:03:07,304
I guess it was only
a matter of time.

1085
01:03:20,852 --> 01:03:24,655
Mrs. Jones,
are you sleeping again?

1086
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,235
Her feet.

1087
01:03:38,268 --> 01:03:40,737
You never checked her feet.

1088
01:03:40,772 --> 01:03:43,206
Sir, is there someone
we can call for you?

1089
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,107
No.

1090
01:03:54,351 --> 01:03:55,319
Can you
check on my wife?

1091
01:03:55,352 --> 01:03:57,087
We just got married.

1092
01:04:02,794 --> 01:04:04,361
I got a pulse.

1093
01:04:04,394 --> 01:04:06,363
Okay, okay, she's
gonna be okay.

1094
01:04:06,396 --> 01:04:07,464
- Okay.
- It's gonna be okay.

1095
01:04:07,497 --> 01:04:08,532
It's all right.

1096
01:04:08,565 --> 01:04:09,633
There you go.

1097
01:04:14,237 --> 01:04:15,138
Hey.

1098
01:04:15,172 --> 01:04:16,139
What's up man?

1099
01:04:16,173 --> 01:04:17,140
Hey.

1100
01:04:17,174 --> 01:04:17,875
Good for you.

1101
01:04:17,909 --> 01:04:18,675
You got that water thing going.

1102
01:04:18,709 --> 01:04:19,576
It's about time.

1103
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:20,477
Yeah.

1104
01:04:22,713 --> 01:04:24,581
You look happy.

1105
01:04:24,615 --> 01:04:27,618
Nah, man, it's
just my usual face.

1106
01:04:27,651 --> 01:04:30,755
Did you go on that date yet?

1107
01:04:30,788 --> 01:04:32,556
What date?

1108
01:04:32,589 --> 01:04:33,858
You know, with Francesca?

1109
01:04:33,891 --> 01:04:34,892
Did you go on that date?

1110
01:04:34,926 --> 01:04:36,226
Yeah, we went on a date.

1111
01:04:37,661 --> 01:04:40,197
Actually, it's been three dates.

1112
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,565
- Three?
- And a fourth

1113
01:04:41,598 --> 01:04:42,432
tomorrow.

1114
01:04:42,466 --> 01:04:43,400
Whoa.

1115
01:04:43,433 --> 01:04:45,502
When did all this happen?

1116
01:04:46,603 --> 01:04:48,538
Yeah, I mean, I know I,

1117
01:04:49,506 --> 01:04:51,541
I haven't been around.

1118
01:04:51,575 --> 01:04:52,442
Yeah.

1119
01:04:53,377 --> 01:04:54,678
It's wow.

1120
01:04:54,711 --> 01:04:58,348
Look, I didn't want
to bring it up, man.

1121
01:04:58,382 --> 01:04:59,416
I don't know.

1122
01:04:59,449 --> 01:05:00,717
Oh no, no, no.

1123
01:05:00,751 --> 01:05:02,319
It's, it's great.

1124
01:05:02,352 --> 01:05:04,254
It's, it's really good to
hear good news for a change.

1125
01:05:04,287 --> 01:05:06,256
So you know, it's awesome.

1126
01:05:06,289 --> 01:05:07,591
- Thanks.
- Really happy for you.

1127
01:05:07,624 --> 01:05:10,560
Well if you think
that's good news,

1128
01:05:10,594 --> 01:05:13,463
then you would be
interested in this.

1129
01:05:13,497 --> 01:05:14,364
Bam!

1130
01:05:15,465 --> 01:05:16,333
Oh.

1131
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:18,368
Way to go, Chuck.

1132
01:05:18,402 --> 01:05:20,270
And only after a few dates.

1133
01:05:20,303 --> 01:05:21,271
That, that's impressive.

1134
01:05:21,304 --> 01:05:22,339
That's...

1135
01:05:22,372 --> 01:05:23,407
- Hey.
- That's awesome.

1136
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,777
- It's not over yet.
- Yeah.

1137
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:27,577
That's what you told me.

1138
01:05:27,611 --> 01:05:28,478
I did?

1139
01:05:29,446 --> 01:05:30,580
Look, man.

1140
01:05:30,614 --> 01:05:32,817
When you first
started working here,

1141
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:36,620
I had just had that horrible
break up with Doreen.

1142
01:05:36,653 --> 01:05:39,423
Yeah, you were in
pretty bad shape.

1143
01:05:39,456 --> 01:05:41,224
You got that right.

1144
01:05:41,258 --> 01:05:44,594
But then you told me I
would meet somebody else

1145
01:05:44,628 --> 01:05:46,964
and I said it's
never gonna happen.

1146
01:05:46,998 --> 01:05:49,700
It's never gonna happen, man.

1147
01:05:49,733 --> 01:05:51,601
I couldn't believe it.

1148
01:05:54,571 --> 01:05:55,973
But then you said.

1149
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:58,843
It's not over yet.

1150
01:05:58,876 --> 01:06:00,277
That's right.

1151
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,481
It's not over yet.

1152
01:06:07,852 --> 01:06:08,853
I hope so.

1153
01:06:14,058 --> 01:06:14,892
Me too.

1154
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:43,653
Jonathan.

1155
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:46,623
It's okay.

1156
01:06:46,656 --> 01:06:47,624
It's okay.

1157
01:06:47,657 --> 01:06:49,827
Everything's okay.

1158
01:08:07,171 --> 01:08:08,039
Stop the car.

1159
01:08:08,072 --> 01:08:08,906
What?

1160
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:09,774
Stop, stop, stop.

1161
01:08:09,807 --> 01:08:10,975
There's, look.

1162
01:08:11,008 --> 01:08:12,609
Look, look.

1163
01:08:12,642 --> 01:08:14,511
There's a bench.

1164
01:08:14,544 --> 01:08:15,378
Oh.

1165
01:08:17,747 --> 01:08:19,349
Look at the bench.

1166
01:08:20,417 --> 01:08:21,751
Oh, it's perfect.

1167
01:08:23,087 --> 01:08:23,921
Great.

1168
01:08:23,955 --> 01:08:25,022
Clean it up, and,

1169
01:08:25,056 --> 01:08:25,923
oh yeah.

1170
01:08:27,859 --> 01:08:28,993
Oh, I love it.

1171
01:08:32,495 --> 01:08:33,931
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1172
01:08:33,965 --> 01:08:35,099
It's probably
full of termites.

1173
01:08:35,132 --> 01:08:36,466
No, no.

1174
01:08:36,499 --> 01:08:37,500
We can like clean
it up or something.

1175
01:08:37,534 --> 01:08:38,401
It's fine.

1176
01:08:39,136 --> 01:08:40,604
Oh, it's so good.

1177
01:08:40,637 --> 01:08:42,073
Why don't you
just get a new one?

1178
01:08:42,106 --> 01:08:43,140
- It's just like...
- It's not the same.

1179
01:08:43,174 --> 01:08:44,574
It's not the same.

1180
01:08:44,608 --> 01:08:46,509
It's just like a
Home Depot bench.

1181
01:08:46,543 --> 01:08:47,510
They're really cheap.

1182
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:48,678
I know, I know.

1183
01:08:48,712 --> 01:08:49,814
Well, I'm just
letting you know

1184
01:08:49,847 --> 01:08:50,948
in case you think
you're going to do it up

1185
01:08:50,982 --> 01:08:52,149
and sell for a million dollars.

1186
01:08:52,183 --> 01:08:53,483
Cause it's not going to happen.

1187
01:08:53,516 --> 01:08:54,684
It's not worth anything.

1188
01:08:54,718 --> 01:08:55,719
I know.

1189
01:08:55,752 --> 01:08:56,620
It's okay.

1190
01:08:57,721 --> 01:08:59,123
Come on, it's great.

1191
01:08:59,156 --> 01:09:00,191
Please,

1192
01:09:00,224 --> 01:09:02,392
please, please, please.

1193
01:09:03,127 --> 01:09:04,594
Okay, okay.

1194
01:09:04,628 --> 01:09:06,696
More junk for the house.

1195
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:07,664
All right.

1196
01:09:07,697 --> 01:09:09,566
It's not junk.

1197
01:09:09,599 --> 01:09:10,433
Man.

1198
01:09:10,467 --> 01:09:11,601
Can you?

1199
01:09:11,635 --> 01:09:12,169
- It's gross.
- Just be careful.

1200
01:09:12,203 --> 01:09:13,771
Don't scratch.

1201
01:09:13,804 --> 01:09:15,139
Okay, okay.

1202
01:09:15,172 --> 01:09:16,706
All right, here we go.

1203
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:17,775
Okay, all right.

1204
01:09:17,808 --> 01:09:19,476
Right there, that's good.

1205
01:09:19,509 --> 01:09:20,177
Watch it.

1206
01:09:20,211 --> 01:09:21,578
Watch it.

1207
01:09:21,611 --> 01:09:22,479
You know, it's not
really helping me,

1208
01:09:22,512 --> 01:09:23,680
what you're doing.

1209
01:09:23,713 --> 01:09:24,849
- Doesn't really help at all.
- Stop.

1210
01:09:24,882 --> 01:09:27,484
- But I appreciate it.
- This is great.

1211
01:09:27,517 --> 01:09:28,752
It might make you feel better.

1212
01:09:28,786 --> 01:09:29,787
Just,

1213
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:30,788
all right lift it,

1214
01:09:30,821 --> 01:09:31,789
higher, higher.

1215
01:09:31,822 --> 01:09:32,823
Oh, careful.

1216
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:34,825
Jonathan.

1217
01:10:34,919 --> 01:10:35,786
Yes.

1218
01:10:37,054 --> 01:10:38,655
Yes, right there.

1219
01:10:38,688 --> 01:10:39,857
That's exactly it.

1220
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:41,258
Thank you for your help.

1221
01:10:41,292 --> 01:10:42,193
- Yes.
- Excuse me.

1222
01:10:42,226 --> 01:10:43,593
You're welcome, honey.

1223
01:10:43,626 --> 01:10:44,895
This is good.

1224
01:10:44,929 --> 01:10:45,863
This is good.

1225
01:10:45,896 --> 01:10:47,865
Okay, that way, that way.

1226
01:10:49,967 --> 01:10:50,935
I love it.

1227
01:10:50,968 --> 01:10:51,836
I love it.

1228
01:10:51,869 --> 01:10:53,070
It's so good.

1229
01:10:53,104 --> 01:10:54,071
It's like Betsy.

1230
01:10:54,105 --> 01:10:55,172
Yeah.

1231
01:10:55,206 --> 01:10:57,775
Just as old and ugly is Betsy.

1232
01:10:59,609 --> 01:11:00,244
It true.

1233
01:11:05,783 --> 01:11:08,752
Do you remember
when we first met?

1234
01:11:09,652 --> 01:11:11,055
Yeah.

1235
01:11:25,735 --> 01:11:29,774
Do you
remember our first date?

1236
01:11:29,807 --> 01:11:31,008
Yeah.

1237
01:11:31,042 --> 01:11:32,309
It was the park.

1238
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:35,146
Yeah, a park.

1239
01:11:35,179 --> 01:11:36,213
It had that tree,

1240
01:11:36,247 --> 01:11:38,648
a river running through it.

1241
01:11:44,822 --> 01:11:46,090
Oh, and the bench, yeah.

1242
01:11:46,123 --> 01:11:47,124
The bench.

1243
01:11:52,163 --> 01:11:55,299
And we just talk
about our future, and

1244
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:59,270
how many children we'd have,

1245
01:11:59,303 --> 01:12:01,738
what kind of house we'd own.

1246
01:12:03,774 --> 01:12:04,607
I told you

1247
01:12:05,843 --> 01:12:07,144
I wanted to have a house

1248
01:12:07,178 --> 01:12:10,580
on a river with a
bench just like this.

1249
01:12:12,116 --> 01:12:14,085
We could just sit on it.

1250
01:12:15,886 --> 01:12:17,755
And grow old together.

1251
01:12:20,091 --> 01:12:20,958
Remember?

1252
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:51,755
Well, that worked.

1253
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:00,697
It's,

1254
01:13:02,833 --> 01:13:04,034
this feels so...

1255
01:13:06,103 --> 01:13:07,071
Real?

1256
01:13:07,104 --> 01:13:07,938
Yeah.

1257
01:13:09,406 --> 01:13:11,842
It's like I I was in a dream

1258
01:13:13,244 --> 01:13:15,379
but now I've woken up.

1259
01:13:15,412 --> 01:13:16,280
Yeah.

1260
01:13:17,448 --> 01:13:18,415
This is it.

1261
01:13:18,449 --> 01:13:19,817
This is it, Jonathan.

1262
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:22,786
This is the house I
always dreamed of.

1263
01:13:23,787 --> 01:13:25,289
I should've listened to you.

1264
01:13:25,322 --> 01:13:26,190
I know.

1265
01:13:27,825 --> 01:13:29,894
It's okay, it's okay.

1266
01:13:29,927 --> 01:13:30,761
It doesn't matter anymore.

1267
01:13:30,794 --> 01:13:31,929
That's in the past.

1268
01:13:31,962 --> 01:13:33,063
I'm sorry.

1269
01:13:33,097 --> 01:13:34,098
I just,

1270
01:13:34,131 --> 01:13:36,767
I spent our whole marriage

1271
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,269
working, trying to

1272
01:13:38,302 --> 01:13:42,006
get enough money to buy
you your dream house.

1273
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:43,407
And in the process,

1274
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,911
we never got to spend
any time together.

1275
01:13:48,379 --> 01:13:50,481
I wasted all that time.

1276
01:13:50,514 --> 01:13:51,382
I'm sorry.

1277
01:13:53,851 --> 01:13:56,954
I guess God had a better plan,

1278
01:13:56,987 --> 01:13:59,223
just not the one I thought.

1279
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:02,993
It doesn't even
matter anymore.

1280
01:14:03,027 --> 01:14:05,095
There's something
that's been puzzling me

1281
01:14:05,129 --> 01:14:06,230
since I've been here.

1282
01:14:06,263 --> 01:14:09,233
What's that?

1283
01:14:09,266 --> 01:14:11,101
How did I get here?

1284
01:14:12,236 --> 01:14:14,737
Jonathan, you'll know soon.

1285
01:14:18,242 --> 01:14:19,109
Okay.

1286
01:14:52,142 --> 01:14:55,546
Everybody, what
are you doing here?

1287
01:14:55,579 --> 01:14:58,249
Hey, I got you some help.

1288
01:14:58,282 --> 01:14:59,250
Yeah?

1289
01:14:59,283 --> 01:15:00,784
What for?

1290
01:15:00,818 --> 01:15:02,519
We just want to help
you move that bolder.

1291
01:15:02,553 --> 01:15:05,856
I mean, you keep going on
about how annoying it is.

1292
01:15:05,889 --> 01:15:07,424
So I don't know, man.

1293
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:09,126
We just want to
help, that's all.

1294
01:15:09,159 --> 01:15:10,861
Yeah, but

1295
01:15:10,894 --> 01:15:12,263
don't worry about it.

1296
01:15:12,296 --> 01:15:14,131
I'm probably just going
to sell the house with it.

1297
01:15:14,164 --> 01:15:14,999
It's fine.

1298
01:15:15,032 --> 01:15:15,866
What?

1299
01:15:16,834 --> 01:15:18,002
With that thing?

1300
01:15:18,035 --> 01:15:19,436
Yeah, yeah.

1301
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:22,206
Look, I'm not a
real estate expert,

1302
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,308
but I'm sure if we got
rid of that eyesore,

1303
01:15:24,341 --> 01:15:27,077
then you'll probably
get a lot more for it.

1304
01:15:27,111 --> 01:15:28,479
Yeah, I don't know.

1305
01:15:28,512 --> 01:15:30,981
I mean, I've been trying to
move that thing for years.

1306
01:15:31,015 --> 01:15:32,916
It's just not going to budge.

1307
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:33,884
So don't worry about it.

1308
01:15:33,917 --> 01:15:36,487
Hey, it's not over yet.

1309
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:40,557
Yeah.

1310
01:15:40,591 --> 01:15:43,360
Beginning to regret I ever
told you that expression.

1311
01:15:45,562 --> 01:15:46,897
No way.

1312
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:49,533
It's my favorite
catchphrase, man,

1313
01:15:50,534 --> 01:15:52,970
and my fiance's as well.

1314
01:15:53,003 --> 01:15:53,971
Wow.

1315
01:15:54,004 --> 01:15:54,972
That's awesome, man.

1316
01:15:55,005 --> 01:15:55,973
Congratulations.

1317
01:15:56,006 --> 01:15:56,974
That's really great.

1318
01:15:57,007 --> 01:15:58,142
- That's awesome.
- Thanks, man.

1319
01:15:58,175 --> 01:15:59,476
And Pastor Steve
is going to marry us.

1320
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:00,911
Oh, that's great.

1321
01:16:00,944 --> 01:16:01,979
Awesome.

1322
01:16:02,012 --> 01:16:04,181
And well, I was wondering

1323
01:16:04,214 --> 01:16:07,051
if we could have
the ceremony here

1324
01:16:07,084 --> 01:16:08,585
because I live in an apartment

1325
01:16:08,619 --> 01:16:10,354
and so does she.

1326
01:16:10,387 --> 01:16:11,255
Here?

1327
01:16:12,289 --> 01:16:13,590
Really?

1328
01:16:13,624 --> 01:16:16,960
I mean, once the
boulder's out, of course.

1329
01:16:18,362 --> 01:16:19,229
Well,

1330
01:16:20,464 --> 01:16:21,332
okay then,

1331
01:16:22,466 --> 01:16:24,068
I guess you're right.

1332
01:16:24,101 --> 01:16:25,202
It's not over yet.

1333
01:16:27,571 --> 01:16:29,073
- Let's do it.
- Let's get to it.

1334
01:16:29,106 --> 01:16:30,908
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1335
01:16:30,941 --> 01:16:32,376
Let's do it, fellas.

1336
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:15,652
It's a stubborn old thing.

1337
01:17:16,587 --> 01:17:17,454
Wow.

1338
01:17:20,023 --> 01:17:22,126
I got an idea.

1339
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:23,560
Where you going?

1340
01:17:34,204 --> 01:17:36,540
Oh man, I
hate this piece of junk.

1341
01:17:36,573 --> 01:17:38,442
Hey, now, hey, stop.

1342
01:17:39,443 --> 01:17:42,012
Don't be hating on old Betsy.

1343
01:17:43,313 --> 01:17:44,615
Betsy.

1344
01:17:44,648 --> 01:17:45,616
Yeah, Betsy.

1345
01:17:45,649 --> 01:17:46,617
That's her name.

1346
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:48,318
Don't you remember?

1347
01:17:50,187 --> 01:17:52,556
Since when did Betsy
become the official name

1348
01:17:52,589 --> 01:17:53,557
of this old truck?

1349
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:55,058
It's official.

1350
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,030
Pop's had her as long
as I can remember,

1351
01:18:02,232 --> 01:18:04,234
until he gave her to us.

1352
01:18:05,436 --> 01:18:07,638
And here, yep, there it is.

1353
01:18:09,206 --> 01:18:11,508
She's got her trusty roadmap.

1354
01:18:25,255 --> 01:18:26,190
See, there you go.

1355
01:18:26,223 --> 01:18:28,358
She's a reliable old broad.

1356
01:18:28,392 --> 01:18:30,060
Betsy.

1357
01:18:30,093 --> 01:18:30,727
What?

1358
01:18:30,762 --> 01:18:31,695
Don't say it.

1359
01:18:31,728 --> 01:18:34,097
- I wasn't...
- Don't say it.

1360
01:18:35,767 --> 01:18:39,102
I wasn't going to
say just like you.

1361
01:18:54,117 --> 01:18:55,252
You guys ready?

1362
01:18:55,285 --> 01:18:56,320
Let's do it.

1363
01:19:01,225 --> 01:19:02,659
Wait, wait, stop.

1364
01:19:04,461 --> 01:19:06,196
We forgot something.

1365
01:19:07,164 --> 01:19:09,500
We need to pray this thing away.

1366
01:19:09,533 --> 01:19:10,367
Jonathan.

1367
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,336
Yeah?

1368
01:19:12,369 --> 01:19:13,237
I don't,

1369
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:18,175
I don't want you

1370
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:20,077
to do this life alone.

1371
01:19:25,215 --> 01:19:26,283
Okay?

1372
01:19:26,316 --> 01:19:27,184
I

1373
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:31,188
just don't want you to go.

1374
01:19:31,221 --> 01:19:33,156
I don't want you to go.

1375
01:19:37,762 --> 01:19:39,062
Don't worry.

1376
01:19:39,096 --> 01:19:41,565
Listen, you're
going to see again.

1377
01:19:41,598 --> 01:19:42,466
Okay?

1378
01:19:46,403 --> 01:19:48,105
You gotta let go.

1379
01:19:48,138 --> 01:19:50,574
And you gotta let God in.

1380
01:19:58,115 --> 01:19:59,817
Don't forget that.

1381
01:19:59,851 --> 01:20:01,385
You gotta Him in.

1382
01:20:02,519 --> 01:20:05,589
It's too hard to do
on your own, okay.

1383
01:20:07,391 --> 01:20:08,258
Okay.

1384
01:20:12,897 --> 01:20:13,765
Let go.

1385
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:17,100
Let go, okay.

1386
01:20:23,473 --> 01:20:24,474
Okay, God,

1387
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:28,178
it's your turn now.

1388
01:22:01,973 --> 01:22:03,407
Jonathan, stop.

1389
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,643
I think you're going
to blow the engine.

1390
01:22:06,677 --> 01:22:08,311
You're gonna blow the engine.

1391
01:22:08,345 --> 01:22:09,746
I got this.

1392
01:22:09,781 --> 01:22:11,816
You remember when I was
just about to get married.

1393
01:22:11,849 --> 01:22:13,851
You pulled me
aside and you said,

1394
01:22:13,885 --> 01:22:16,553
with faith, you
can move mountains.

1395
01:22:16,586 --> 01:22:17,521
What?

1396
01:22:17,554 --> 01:22:19,423
Well this is a mountain.

1397
01:22:19,456 --> 01:22:20,825
We can move this.

1398
01:22:20,858 --> 01:22:21,725
Well.

1399
01:22:31,869 --> 01:22:32,870
Keep going.

1400
01:22:32,904 --> 01:22:34,237
What?

1401
01:22:34,271 --> 01:22:35,338
Keep going.

1402
01:22:36,941 --> 01:22:37,875
Hey, hey.

1403
01:22:38,876 --> 01:22:39,877
It's moving.

1404
01:22:40,845 --> 01:22:42,312
It's moving.

1405
01:22:51,555 --> 01:22:53,290
It's not over yet.

1406
01:23:05,302 --> 01:23:06,737
Okay.

1407
01:23:06,771 --> 01:23:08,505
Now we can get going.

1408
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:11,608
What?

1409
01:23:11,641 --> 01:23:12,509
Get going.

1410
01:23:13,911 --> 01:23:15,746
Didn't you tell him?

1411
01:23:17,014 --> 01:23:17,882
Oh yeah.

1412
01:23:19,016 --> 01:23:21,451
I haven't been clear
about the date.

1413
01:23:21,485 --> 01:23:22,552
Date?

1414
01:23:22,586 --> 01:23:24,055
Yeah.

1415
01:23:24,088 --> 01:23:25,923
The wedding is today.

1416
01:23:27,691 --> 01:23:28,658
Ah, okay.

1417
01:23:31,695 --> 01:23:33,663
It's a surprise wedding.

1418
01:23:33,697 --> 01:23:36,333
She thinks he's coming
to meet my folks,

1419
01:23:36,366 --> 01:23:37,769
but,

1420
01:23:37,802 --> 01:23:39,904
well, she's got to meet them

1421
01:23:39,937 --> 01:23:43,507
and then we're going
to go get married.

1422
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:44,374
Okay.

1423
01:23:44,407 --> 01:23:45,642
But I,

1424
01:23:45,675 --> 01:23:46,944
I don't have anything.

1425
01:23:46,978 --> 01:23:48,645
Oh, don't worry.

1426
01:23:48,678 --> 01:23:49,814
We have the catering

1427
01:23:49,847 --> 01:23:51,816
and seating, et cetera
coming from church.

1428
01:23:51,849 --> 01:23:53,350
It's all taken care of.

1429
01:23:53,383 --> 01:23:55,352
And we'll clean it up.

1430
01:23:55,385 --> 01:23:56,854
Okay.

1431
01:23:56,888 --> 01:23:57,721
All right.

1432
01:23:57,754 --> 01:23:58,622
Okay.

1433
01:23:58,655 --> 01:24:00,057
Let's, let's do it then.

1434
01:24:00,091 --> 01:24:01,291
Let's do it.

1435
01:24:18,042 --> 01:24:18,976
Jonathan?

1436
01:24:19,944 --> 01:24:21,678
What are you doing?

1437
01:24:21,711 --> 01:24:22,712
Elizabeth,

1438
01:24:27,118 --> 01:24:29,053
will you marry me?

1439
01:24:35,092 --> 01:24:36,526
Jonathan?

1440
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:37,995
What are you doing?

1441
01:24:41,799 --> 01:24:42,800
Oh, I see.

1442
01:24:45,002 --> 01:24:47,972
Maybe we should drive
around the block, hun.

1443
01:24:48,005 --> 01:24:49,106
Okay.

1444
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:49,974
Yeah, okay.

1445
01:24:50,007 --> 01:24:50,842
Okay.

1446
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:52,576
Oh my gosh.

1447
01:24:57,048 --> 01:24:58,049
Sorry.

1448
01:24:58,082 --> 01:24:59,516
I was kind of choking.

1449
01:24:59,549 --> 01:25:00,584
Are you okay?

1450
01:25:00,617 --> 01:25:01,919
I'm fine.

1451
01:25:01,953 --> 01:25:03,087
Were my parents just here?

1452
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:03,955
Oh.

1453
01:25:03,988 --> 01:25:05,589
Yeah.

1454
01:25:05,622 --> 01:25:07,591
They're just going to drive
around the block for awhile.

1455
01:25:07,624 --> 01:25:09,126
Why?

1456
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,828
Well.

1457
01:25:10,862 --> 01:25:13,496
Oh, I haven't
answered you yet?

1458
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:14,631
No.

1459
01:25:14,664 --> 01:25:15,498
Yes.

1460
01:25:15,532 --> 01:25:16,901
Yes.

1461
01:25:16,934 --> 01:25:18,401
Oh, my leg's asleep.

1462
01:25:18,435 --> 01:25:19,837
- No.
- Come here.

1463
01:25:21,038 --> 01:25:23,406
How are you feeling?

1464
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,509
Man, I don't know
if I can do this.

1465
01:25:27,812 --> 01:25:30,982
With faith the size
of a mustard seed,

1466
01:25:31,015 --> 01:25:33,184
you can move mountains.

1467
01:25:35,887 --> 01:25:37,487
Am I good?

1468
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:38,655
You look great, brother.

1469
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:40,024
I've known you
two for a while now.

1470
01:25:40,057 --> 01:25:42,894
So I knew this was
only a matter of time.

1471
01:25:42,927 --> 01:25:44,862
When something is God's will,

1472
01:25:44,896 --> 01:25:47,999
the only thing standing
in the way is us.

1473
01:25:48,032 --> 01:25:51,135
When we let go and we
let God take the reins,

1474
01:25:51,168 --> 01:25:54,005
everything goes much smoother.

1475
01:25:54,038 --> 01:25:58,910
So while all of this seems to
be happening rather quickly,

1476
01:25:58,943 --> 01:26:01,645
it's been destined
from the beginning.

1477
01:26:01,678 --> 01:26:03,713
Today it is my pleasure

1478
01:26:03,747 --> 01:26:05,749
to bring you two
together under God,

1479
01:26:05,783 --> 01:26:07,985
as husband and wife.

1480
01:26:08,019 --> 01:26:09,954
You may kiss the bride.

1481
01:26:42,219 --> 01:26:44,055
It's amazing.

1482
01:26:44,088 --> 01:26:45,823
Is all food this good?

1483
01:26:45,856 --> 01:26:46,958
I mean it's incredible.

1484
01:26:46,991 --> 01:26:47,925
Yeah.

1485
01:26:47,959 --> 01:26:48,759
Everything's amazing here.

1486
01:26:48,793 --> 01:26:49,592
I mean it's Heaven.

1487
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:50,694
Well yeah.

1488
01:26:51,594 --> 01:26:53,030
And that's not it.

1489
01:26:53,064 --> 01:26:54,865
It's not just about pie, honey.

1490
01:26:54,899 --> 01:26:56,599
There's so much more to see.

1491
01:26:56,633 --> 01:26:58,903
I mean you could spend
a thousand years here

1492
01:26:58,936 --> 01:27:01,839
and there's always something
new to experience and see

1493
01:27:01,872 --> 01:27:05,076
and smell and it never gets old.

1494
01:27:05,109 --> 01:27:07,544
You never get used to it.

1495
01:27:07,577 --> 01:27:08,578
Oh, sorry.

1496
01:27:15,685 --> 01:27:17,121
That's okay, honey.

1497
01:27:17,154 --> 01:27:18,688
Actually, that's the best part.

1498
01:27:18,722 --> 01:27:21,258
You can eat as much as you want.

1499
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,028
Whoa.

1500
01:27:25,863 --> 01:27:26,730
Wow.

1501
01:27:28,766 --> 01:27:29,699
I guess that's Heaven, isn't it.

1502
01:27:40,244 --> 01:27:42,980
Have I got something on my face?

1503
01:27:44,048 --> 01:27:45,249
No.

1504
01:27:45,282 --> 01:27:46,150
It's just,

1505
01:27:47,284 --> 01:27:50,021
this next part is so special.

1506
01:27:50,054 --> 01:27:51,288
Well it's already
been pretty special.

1507
01:27:51,322 --> 01:27:52,289
No, I know.

1508
01:27:52,323 --> 01:27:54,025
I know, but,

1509
01:27:54,058 --> 01:27:54,925
but this,

1510
01:27:56,127 --> 01:27:58,561
this is why we're here.

1511
01:28:04,734 --> 01:28:05,836
Whoa.

1512
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:06,736
Is that?

1513
01:28:08,806 --> 01:28:09,672
Yes.

1514
01:28:10,707 --> 01:28:12,043
I can just...

1515
01:28:12,076 --> 01:28:13,643
Yes, daddy.

1516
01:28:13,676 --> 01:28:14,677
He's real nice.

1517
01:28:14,711 --> 01:28:16,147
He's always been there for me.

1518
01:28:16,180 --> 01:28:18,681
And you can talk
to him any time.

1519
01:28:25,756 --> 01:28:27,124
I feel,

1520
01:28:27,158 --> 01:28:28,225
I don't know.

1521
01:28:30,094 --> 01:28:32,063
It's hard to explain.

1522
01:28:32,096 --> 01:28:35,933
I'm just really, I'm not
nervous or anything, but, whoa.

1523
01:28:35,966 --> 01:28:38,169
It's okay, it's okay.

1524
01:28:38,202 --> 01:28:39,336
You can go.

1525
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:40,737
Just let it go.

1526
01:28:41,704 --> 01:28:42,572
Go.

1527
01:28:57,388 --> 01:28:58,255
Hey.

1528
01:28:59,689 --> 01:29:00,825
Where are you?

1529
01:29:00,858 --> 01:29:03,360
I'm on the Mercy
ship right now.

1530
01:29:03,394 --> 01:29:06,263
We had to go to port because
the weather's been so bad.

1531
01:29:06,297 --> 01:29:08,966
So I think I found
the one room on ship

1532
01:29:08,999 --> 01:29:12,770
that actually has
a wifi connection.

1533
01:29:12,803 --> 01:29:14,138
Wow.

1534
01:29:14,171 --> 01:29:16,841
I just wanted to
check with you, you know

1535
01:29:16,874 --> 01:29:19,676
and see how you're doing.

1536
01:29:19,709 --> 01:29:20,778
Yeah, yeah.

1537
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:24,614
I'm doing okay.

1538
01:29:28,718 --> 01:29:29,787
Oh, a,

1539
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:32,356
I, I got the
boulder out finally.

1540
01:29:34,225 --> 01:29:35,192
Mount Rushmore?

1541
01:29:35,226 --> 01:29:37,061
You got rid of the boulder?

1542
01:29:37,094 --> 01:29:38,329
No way.

1543
01:29:46,103 --> 01:29:48,272
It was a bit of a miracle.

1544
01:29:48,305 --> 01:29:50,241
I can only imagine.

1545
01:29:50,274 --> 01:29:51,775
So.

1546
01:29:51,809 --> 01:29:55,678
So how are you really
feeling these days?

1547
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,981
Everything okay?

1548
01:30:01,886 --> 01:30:02,752
Yeah.

1549
01:30:05,122 --> 01:30:05,990
I'm okay.

1550
01:30:08,425 --> 01:30:09,293
I'm just,

1551
01:30:12,296 --> 01:30:16,233
just trying to figure out
what to do next, that's all.

1552
01:30:16,267 --> 01:30:18,335
Okay, well that's good.

1553
01:30:18,369 --> 01:30:21,438
Elizabeth wanted
me to quit my job.

1554
01:30:22,739 --> 01:30:24,775
Okay.

1555
01:30:24,808 --> 01:30:27,111
And it was just the,

1556
01:30:27,144 --> 01:30:29,113
the night shift, the long hours,

1557
01:30:29,146 --> 01:30:30,014
it's just,

1558
01:30:31,048 --> 01:30:33,918
it's just wearing me out.

1559
01:30:33,951 --> 01:30:35,685
So why didn't you?

1560
01:30:44,862 --> 01:30:45,728
I don't,

1561
01:30:46,964 --> 01:30:47,831
I don't know.

1562
01:30:47,865 --> 01:30:48,731
I guess,

1563
01:30:49,767 --> 01:30:54,338
I guess I was just
procrastinating a lot, you know.

1564
01:30:54,371 --> 01:30:57,341
She always said I was
a real procrastinator,

1565
01:30:57,374 --> 01:30:59,109
overthinking things.

1566
01:31:01,312 --> 01:31:02,146
But now,

1567
01:31:06,850 --> 01:31:09,153
now that she's gone, I guess,

1568
01:31:12,323 --> 01:31:13,390
I don't know.

1569
01:31:15,125 --> 01:31:16,260
I don't know.

1570
01:31:16,293 --> 01:31:19,763
You know, God speaks
to us all the time.

1571
01:31:21,031 --> 01:31:23,000
And those closest to us

1572
01:31:25,102 --> 01:31:28,105
can be some of God's
loudest voices.

1573
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:33,010
So if she was telling
you to do this,

1574
01:31:34,812 --> 01:31:37,982
and I don't know,
maybe you should.

1575
01:31:38,015 --> 01:31:40,251
I mean this could be

1576
01:31:40,284 --> 01:31:42,752
the next phase in your life.

1577
01:31:43,487 --> 01:31:44,355
Yeah.

1578
01:31:47,424 --> 01:31:51,128
Keep your chin
up brother, okay.

1579
01:31:51,161 --> 01:31:52,029
Okay.

1580
01:31:53,964 --> 01:31:55,933
Talk to you soon.

1581
01:31:55,966 --> 01:31:56,834
Okay.

1582
01:32:25,162 --> 01:32:27,598
Goodbye, old friend.

1583
01:33:25,255 --> 01:33:27,991
Yep, gonna need the old roadmap.

1584
01:33:38,402 --> 01:33:40,204
Okay, honey, you win.

1585
01:33:44,274 --> 01:33:45,876
Time for a change.

1586
01:33:47,111 --> 01:33:47,978
Yeah.

1587
01:33:50,514 --> 01:33:51,382
All right.

1588
01:34:01,024 --> 01:34:02,393
All right.

1589
01:34:17,441 --> 01:34:18,308
Hey God,

1590
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:23,614
it's me again.

1591
01:34:27,484 --> 01:34:29,586
I know it's been a while.

1592
01:34:31,588 --> 01:34:32,923
I'm sorry, but

1593
01:34:37,461 --> 01:34:38,328
I can't

1594
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:44,435
really comprehend everything
that's happened, but

1595
01:34:44,468 --> 01:34:48,572
somehow it's all gonna
make sense in the end.

1596
01:34:48,605 --> 01:34:50,007
You have a plan.

1597
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:52,609
And I just got to
trust it, I guess.

1598
01:34:56,613 --> 01:34:57,481
Anyway,

1599
01:34:59,483 --> 01:35:01,318
Elizabeth wanted
me to change jobs

1600
01:35:01,351 --> 01:35:05,222
and I know I should have
done this earlier, but

1601
01:35:05,255 --> 01:35:06,590
I'm doing it now.

1602
01:35:11,495 --> 01:35:13,363
I wasted so much time.

1603
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:17,267
I spent so much time
trying to fix things,

1604
01:35:17,301 --> 01:35:19,002
and my own strength
trying to make it work,

1605
01:35:19,036 --> 01:35:21,038
and my own strength and,

1606
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:25,108
I should've done this earlier.

1607
01:35:39,122 --> 01:35:39,990
Well,

1608
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:45,195
it's not over yet, huh.

1609
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:52,102
It's not over yet.

1610
01:36:22,299 --> 01:36:24,668
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming.

1611
01:37:21,224 --> 01:37:23,360
Daddy, wake up.

1612
01:37:24,929 --> 01:37:26,330
Daddy, wake up.

1613
01:37:45,649 --> 01:37:46,884
Now I get it.

1614
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:50,855
I was lost, now I'm found.

1615
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:12,442
Come and
sit with me, Jonathan.

1616
01:38:29,761 --> 01:38:32,295
I'm really happy you're here.

1617
01:38:33,965 --> 01:38:37,401
This is, this is pretty cool.

1618
01:38:37,434 --> 01:38:39,236
Yes, Jonathan.

1619
01:38:39,269 --> 01:38:40,203
Yes, it is.

1620
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:42,907
So,

1621
01:38:43,875 --> 01:38:47,611
are you ready for the
next part of your life?

1622
01:38:49,713 --> 01:38:50,580
Yeah.

1623
01:38:52,884 --> 01:38:54,284
Did you know that many people

1624
01:38:54,317 --> 01:38:56,319
have been waiting
for you, Jonathan?

1625
01:38:56,353 --> 01:38:58,555
Especially Rachel.

1626
01:38:58,588 --> 01:39:00,424
She watched with
great excitement

1627
01:39:00,457 --> 01:39:02,292
as I worked in your life.

1628
01:39:02,325 --> 01:39:04,261
And she saw your faith grow.

1629
01:39:04,294 --> 01:39:06,430
And as it grew, it
turned into trust

1630
01:39:06,463 --> 01:39:08,866
and trust blossomed into love.

1631
01:39:10,034 --> 01:39:11,735
From the day of your
salvation until now,

1632
01:39:11,769 --> 01:39:13,303
I've been with you,

1633
01:39:13,336 --> 01:39:15,739
guiding you and directing you.

1634
01:39:16,874 --> 01:39:20,644
I have loved you with
an everlasting love.

1635
01:39:20,677 --> 01:39:22,612
Now rejoice and be glad

1636
01:39:23,848 --> 01:39:25,883
for great is your reward.

1637
01:39:27,551 --> 01:39:30,253
You are receiving your
inheritance that can never perish,

1638
01:39:30,287 --> 01:39:31,421
spoil or fade.

1639
01:39:32,757 --> 01:39:34,357
All this is yours.

1640
01:39:37,627 --> 01:39:39,596
Welcome home, my son.

1641
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:15,298
Pretty amazing, right?

1642
01:40:15,332 --> 01:40:16,000
Yeah.

1643
01:40:17,367 --> 01:40:19,804
How long was he with him for?

1644
01:40:19,837 --> 01:40:22,572
Oh, a thousand
years is like a day.

1645
01:40:22,606 --> 01:40:25,275
A day is like a thousand years.

1646
01:40:26,778 --> 01:40:27,912
It's incredible.

1647
01:40:27,945 --> 01:40:29,080
I know.

1648
01:40:29,113 --> 01:40:30,915
He went through my
whole entire life,

1649
01:40:30,948 --> 01:40:32,549
like my childhood.

1650
01:40:33,550 --> 01:40:35,752
Every day, every second is,

1651
01:40:37,955 --> 01:40:39,523
all the times I
thought I was alone,

1652
01:40:39,556 --> 01:40:42,526
all the times I thought
He wasn't there,

1653
01:40:42,559 --> 01:40:43,761
He was with me.

1654
01:40:45,562 --> 01:40:47,664
He talked to me
about how He was,

1655
01:40:47,697 --> 01:40:49,934
He was raising Rachel
all these years,

1656
01:40:49,967 --> 01:40:51,635
taking care of her.

1657
01:40:52,702 --> 01:40:53,570
And then,

1658
01:40:55,739 --> 01:40:58,843
He just went so
deep into my heart

1659
01:40:58,876 --> 01:41:02,013
that He just took
away all the pain,

1660
01:41:02,046 --> 01:41:03,413
all that burden,

1661
01:41:03,446 --> 01:41:06,750
and all that stuff that
I've been carrying.

1662
01:41:07,985 --> 01:41:09,653
Just left me with...

1663
01:41:09,686 --> 01:41:10,520
Peace.

1664
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:14,424
Peace.

1665
01:41:21,731 --> 01:41:23,835
Jonathan, so good to see you.

1666
01:41:23,868 --> 01:41:25,569
Pops, how are you?

1667
01:41:25,602 --> 01:41:26,838
So how's old Betsy going?

1668
01:41:26,871 --> 01:41:28,973
Well, she was going
right to the very end.

1669
01:41:29,006 --> 01:41:29,974
Wow.

1670
01:41:30,007 --> 01:41:31,408
She outlived me by 15 years.

1671
01:41:31,441 --> 01:41:32,109
Not bad.

1672
01:41:33,077 --> 01:41:34,444
Yeah, she was pretty reliable.

1673
01:41:34,477 --> 01:41:36,981
I'm just glad she
got you both around.

1674
01:41:37,014 --> 01:41:39,649
I just want to say thank
you for the, for the roadmap.

1675
01:41:39,683 --> 01:41:40,985
Better than a GPS.

1676
01:41:41,018 --> 01:41:42,686
Yeah, that's right.

1677
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:45,790
Now, have you tried
Elizabeth's apple pie here?

1678
01:41:45,823 --> 01:41:46,791
It's even better.

1679
01:41:46,824 --> 01:41:47,925
I know.

1680
01:41:47,959 --> 01:41:48,658
Every bite is better
than the last.

1681
01:41:48,692 --> 01:41:49,392
That's right.

1682
01:41:49,426 --> 01:41:50,094
And

1683
01:41:51,728 --> 01:41:53,563
it never runs out.

1684
01:41:53,597 --> 01:41:54,431
That's right.

1685
01:42:05,009 --> 01:42:07,912
Let's give thanks.

1686
01:42:07,945 --> 01:42:09,146
This is incredible.

1687
01:42:14,584 --> 01:42:16,519
Our father,

1688
01:42:16,553 --> 01:42:17,822
who art in Heaven

1689
01:42:18,789 --> 01:42:21,158
hallowed be thy name.

1690
01:42:21,192 --> 01:42:23,627
Thy kingdom has come.

1691
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:26,030
Thy will is done in Heaven.

1692
01:42:26,063 --> 01:42:28,698
Thank you for our daily bread,

1693
01:42:28,732 --> 01:42:31,735
and for forgiving
us of all our sins.

1694
01:42:31,769 --> 01:42:34,906
Thank you for wiping
away all our tears.

1695
01:42:34,939 --> 01:42:38,009
Thank you for delivering
us from all evil.

1696
01:42:38,042 --> 01:42:40,111
For thine is the kingdom,

1697
01:42:40,144 --> 01:42:41,178
and the power,

1698
01:42:41,212 --> 01:42:42,646
an the glory,

1699
01:42:42,679 --> 01:42:44,215
forever and ever.

1700
01:42:44,248 --> 01:42:45,917
Amen.
