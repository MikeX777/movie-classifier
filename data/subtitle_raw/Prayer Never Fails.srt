1
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,757
- Let me go. She needs me.

2
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,791
Let me go.

3
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,884
- Well look who it is.

4
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:45,078
A man smart enough
to end up in cuffs.

5
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,424
- How do you keep
it all together?

6
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:49,448
Hm.

7
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,896
Everything falling
apart in your life and

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,422
still you believe.

9
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:32,886
- Nice shot.

10
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,228
Composure, you gotta
keep that composure.

11
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,877
Come on, Rob, what
are you gonna do?

12
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,736
What are you gonna do?

13
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,448
Come on guys.

14
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,049
You have to know when to
take it hard to the hole,

15
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,584
or when to pull up and shoot.

16
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,528
A player that doesn't know
that is not gonna play

17
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,819
this game long.

18
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,479
When you leave the court
at that final buzzer,

19
00:03:01,503 --> 00:03:03,383
you better be able to look
me in the eye and say

20
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:04,260
that you give it all.

21
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,563
All you had, is
left on the floor.

22
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,165
Give us strength to fight,

23
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,002
to the last man to the
last play to the last bell

24
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,836
we fight.

25
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,004
- We fight.

26
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,171
- We fight.
- We fight.

27
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,339
- We fight.
- We fight.

28
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,507
- We fight.
- We fight.

29
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,675
- We fight.
- We fight.

30
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,843
- We fight.
- We fight.

31
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,011
- We fight.
- We fight.

32
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,178
- We fight.
- We fight.

33
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,146
- We fight.
- We fight.

34
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,170
- Amen.
- Amen.

35
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,026
- I'll catch up with you.
- Bye.

36
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,860
- Hey coach.

37
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,219
- What's up man?

38
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,000
What's going on?

39
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,544
What, you want me to
walk you to class?

40
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:21,236
What's on your mind?

41
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,030
- It's my dad.

42
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,132
He's a punk.

43
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,934
Sometimes,

44
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:35,017
sometimes I just want
to punch him, you know?

45
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,042
He's just...

46
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,344
He's so sick.

47
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,490
- Sick how, man.

48
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
- Kurt.

49
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:55,861
Sit down.

50
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,975
I'm just thinking to myself,
when was the last time

51
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,012
that we had a father son chat?

52
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,713
- I can't recall, sir.

53
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,072
- Neither can I.

54
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,011
So, how's school?

55
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,416
- It's good I guess.

56
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,458
- Girlfriend?

57
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,504
- No.

58
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,139
- No?

59
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,373
Boyfriend?

60
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,875
- What? No.

61
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,643
Any other questions, sir.

62
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,835
- Kurt, relax.

63
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,348
I'm just making sure
that I know my son.

64
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,850
You know they say that
teenagers change, so I'm just

65
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:45,854
determining the level
of your adjustment.

66
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:49,458
- What do you even
know about us?

67
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,093
- You can stop with
the histrionics.

68
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,762
- Do you know your wife
calls her friends cry...

69
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,397
- That's enough.

70
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,590
- Stop it Jim.

71
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,105
- He did that to you?

72
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,950
- I didn't say that. I just...

73
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,151
- Well what did you say?

74
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,220
You better say something, what?

75
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,012
- Never mind. Just...

76
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,325
I tripped whatever, you know.

77
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,752
He was yelling, I got scared.

78
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,323
- Um.

79
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,163
Listen, listen man.

80
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,244
Relationships with our
parents can be very

81
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,346
complicated, okay?

82
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,616
They can be very
very complicated.

83
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,153
We want to protect them a
lot of the time because

84
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,888
they protected us right?

85
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,557
But there comes a time when
a parent can do something

86
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,292
that's gonna cause you to,

87
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,153
to not see them for
over 20 years.

88
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,290
That's, you know, tragedy.

89
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:08,494
It hurts, a lot, but
it does happen.

90
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,942
All I'm saying is
that you know, there

91
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,468
can be a time when

92
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,882
you shouldn't protect them.

93
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,786
- Coach, he's a judge,
what am I supposed to do,

94
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,051
call the cops?

95
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:26,889
- I would suggest that you
pray to know what to do.

96
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,457
- I don't know how to pray.

97
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:32,652
Can you help me get the
conversation started or something?

98
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:14,060
- Mr. Paul, this is Judge
Rogers, Kurt's father.

99
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,263
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.

100
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:22,941
What happened, Kurt, you been...

101
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:24,479
- Judge Rogers was
in my office today

102
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:26,506
before I finished lunch.

103
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,951
- You pervert.

104
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,420
If I find out you laid
a hand on my son.

105
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,989
- Dude, are you
serious right now?

106
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:38,184
- You do understand that praying
is against school policy?

107
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,489
- I know the policy.

108
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,872
- You people use religious
coercion and propaganda to

109
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,040
brainwash kids like my boy.

110
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,610
I presided over three cases
where so called Preachers

111
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,211
were praying.

112
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,079
- Dad, you're tripping.

113
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,103
- Shut up!

114
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,590
Don't use that kind
of language with me.

115
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,193
I never should have brought
you to this school.

116
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,785
God does not exist.

117
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,833
And no so called coach is
gonna change that fact.

118
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,468
- Well maybe he doesn't exist,

119
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,494
because if he did exist,

120
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,776
he wouldn't have made
you such a jerk.

121
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,877
- Aiden, stop!

122
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,545
Stop!

123
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:34,082
Clean out your office,
get out of here.

124
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:36,652
Get out of here, Aiden,

125
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,552
get out of here.

126
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:38,887
- What are you talking about?

127
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,271
What are you doing?
- You're fired!

128
00:09:40,295 --> 00:09:41,823
You're fired. - I'm fired?

129
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,626
For what? - Go!

130
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,928
Get out of my school.

131
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,432
- I didn't do anything, Mr.
Patterson.

132
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:48,463
- You did. Go.

133
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,833
- Mr. Patterson, those are
my boys that I coach.

134
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,759
- Those were your boys.

135
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:55,504
- Mr...

136
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,530
- It's done.

137
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,232
I'm sorry, go.

138
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
- Mr...

139
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,570
- Go, go home.

140
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,482
It's time, go home.

141
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,506
Go home.

142
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,964
- Alright, listen up.

143
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,143
I've got some bad news.

144
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,712
Coach Paul's been terminated

145
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,115
and he's not gonna coach tonight

146
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,416
nor any further.

147
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,653
I'll have my starting
five at tip off.

148
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,322
Everybody be ready.

149
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,186
- Are you serious?

150
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:50,285
- Hey lawyer, who doesn't
answer the phone.

151
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,029
Calling to let you know
that we're not doing

152
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:54,222
business with you anymore.

153
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,325
Your line's closed,

154
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:00,295
and you need to get out of
this thing before you end

155
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,654
up getting hurt.

156
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,238
- Everybody's sweating bullets.

157
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:13,475
Weaves going back and oh...

158
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,676
One girl's had separated,

159
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,045
it looked like two
different people.

160
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:23,709
I'm telling you, I would've
been so embarrassed.

161
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,154
- Oh my God.

162
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,591
- Miss Lilly, on
a church Sunday,

163
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,951
fell out with a heat stroke.

164
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,697
Roll it went up over her head.

165
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,623
It was so embarrassing.

166
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,860
Oh, Lord, I mean,

167
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:46,799
it is so hot and we can't
get a drop from the sky.

168
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,711
- It hasn't been
this bad for years.

169
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,213
- It really hasn't.

170
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,249
I mean, I can't remember when
we had a drought like this.

171
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,273
It was...

172
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,509
Oh...

173
00:12:58,421 --> 00:12:59,421
- What?

174
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,347
- You know when it was?

175
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,417
That summer I found
out I had a twin.

176
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,565
And I would sit under that
big old live oak tree.

177
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:14,269
I said, "God you just saving
your tears until I find"

178
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,905
my baby brother and then
you going rain down those

179
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,807
cool tears of joy.

180
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,809
Baby brother, shoot.

181
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,043
Dog gone it.

182
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,279
- Well you are five
minutes older than me.

183
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,147
- Well how do you know?

184
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,648
I'm gonna check the records.

185
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,251
You better stop talking
that older sister stuff,

186
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,552
thank you, Bill.

187
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:34,222
- We found out we liked the
same flavor ice cream.

188
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,015
- I know, it's crazy.

189
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:38,059
Both hate okra.

190
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,561
- Oh you know it's true.

191
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,896
Can't stand it.

192
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,990
- Hm mm mm.

193
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,730
Hmm.

194
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,404
So how's the practice going?

195
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,840
- It's good, doing very good.

196
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,012
- And my case?

197
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,581
- Good.

198
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,664
You know, I filed
all the papers.

199
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:20,502
I just keep waiting and
waiting for the trial date.

200
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,526
- Well it's filed and that's
good, that's progress.

201
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,338
That's really good.

202
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,362
Yeah.

203
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,637
So how you doing for money?

204
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:33,571
- I'm good.

205
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,422
Well I could use a little
loan if you've got it.

206
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,891
Just until the next
settlement comes in.

207
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:43,915
- Michael,

208
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,020
you know I don't put
icing on cornbread.

209
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,189
No, I cannot.

210
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,737
You know I invested
all my savings

211
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:59,975
on the case for son and all those
experts you said I needed.

212
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,611
I don't know if you know
but all of that came

213
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,969
out of my house.

214
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,986
- And you will get it back.

215
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,087
- When?
- Off the top.

216
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,114
- When? It's been
two years Michael.

217
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,060
- Laurel, some of these
things take time.

218
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,796
- Well I don't have time.

219
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,698
Because now the bank is
making rumblings about

220
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,057
taking my house.

221
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:30,129
- How much does the bank say
they want to save your house?

222
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,837
- $10,400, can you find that?

223
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,525
- I'm not gonna let anybody
take that house from you.

224
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:51,549
Okay?

225
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,484
Nobody.

226
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,032
- Promise?

227
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,057
- I promise.

228
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,592
- In Jesus name.

229
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,597
I believe in you.

230
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,872
I don't want this
ice cream to melt.

231
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,659
- You know they can't
keep a good man down.

232
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,496
Tonight.

233
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:16,811
Princeton, Memphis, Oregon,
FSU, those will be easy.

234
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,672
Thanks for that, hope you
still got the touch.

235
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,989
- Excuse me?

236
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,258
You that lawyer, with
all the ads everywhere?

237
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,726
- That would be me.

238
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,261
Michael Brown.

239
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,530
- Do you like
throwing money away?

240
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,865
- Excuse me?

241
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,601
- All those games you
picked, they're all wrong.

242
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,270
Princeton is, Charmin soft.

243
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,773
Oregon is fast, they
can't shoot the ball.

244
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,510
Memphis just got a new
coach, what are you doing?

245
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:52,704
Florida State, they need to
stick to playing football.

246
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:58,887
- Aiden Paul.

247
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,911
- Yeah.

248
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,147
Thank you.

249
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,290
- Hey, thanks.

250
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,569
In case you need a good lawyer.

251
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,371
- Water, coffee, or juice?

252
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,395
- Water and

253
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,899
I'll have the light menu.

254
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,316
- Can you cover this?

255
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,670
- Thank you.

256
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,638
- Any time brother.

257
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,441
- Thanks for taking care
of the boys today, Ray.

258
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,143
- We missed you.

259
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,646
We got outscored by 20
in the second half.

260
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,685
- This thing's got me
thrown, I mean, really.

261
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,787
I got no idea how he could've
found out about that

262
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,990
on the same day, I mean it
doesn't make any sense.

263
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,014
- I know.

264
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,835
- You did?

265
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,859
- Yeah.

266
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,096
Look man,

267
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,231
I feel bad.

268
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,512
I was hoping,

269
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:34,215
this might help you
get on your feet.

270
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,517
Just read it.

271
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,519
The lady's a good lady,

272
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,854
and it's a private school
and all, but I mean,

273
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:40,878
it's a gig.

274
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,523
- Then they started to
concentrate, but they

275
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:09,417
didn't have to concentrate
under pressure.

276
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,819
This is a big deal
right here for this...

277
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:15,914
- Kansas just used
its last time out.

278
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,860
- Oh.

279
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,387
- He backed off as well. Wow.

280
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,836
- He's got one more,
Kansas at the very least

281
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,107
will have a shot to tie
with 10.8 seconds.

282
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,617
- Kansas has made only
two three on the night.

283
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:46,487
They must make one here
to extend the game.

284
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,590
Thomson driving, almost
lost the handle.

285
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:52,560
Chambers for the tie,

286
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,429
Unbelievable.

287
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:58,299
Dosier at mid court, for
the championship no, we're

288
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:01,235
going into overtime
in San Antonio.

289
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:04,138
Jim the free throws did it.

290
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,208
It put Memphis in this position.

291
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,006
- In Heaven.

292
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,678
Beyond my understanding.

293
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,547
My faith is in you.

294
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,761
- What's up, Coach?

295
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,220
- What's up, man?

296
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,116
- Come on, man. Stop acting
like you ain't happy to see

297
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,669
us or something.

298
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,805
I know you miss getting
down with us, huh?

299
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,597
I know you miss that.

300
00:22:46,975 --> 00:22:47,975
What's up, Coach?

301
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,811
- Coach!

302
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,245
- What's up, Coach?

303
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,270
- What's up?

304
00:22:58,977 --> 00:22:59,978
- Hey Coach.

305
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,714
- What's up, man?

306
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,602
Look guys, the important
thing is is that

307
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,128
you stay together,

308
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,741
right, because you're a team.

309
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,210
That's what a team does,
a team stays together,

310
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,802
no matter what. So,

311
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,115
no excuses.

312
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,474
- Look, this Coach Clemmins.

313
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,453
I have no idea what he's doing,

314
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,088
and I don't think he does.

315
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,157
- Hey coach, for real.

316
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,759
They did you wrong.

317
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,460
They did you real wrong.

318
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,429
I don't know if we can

319
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,498
do this without you on
the sidelines, man.

320
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,233
- Yeah you can, man.

321
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,324
Yeah you can.

322
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,404
Well, you know man,

323
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,007
there's no place I'd rather be,

324
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,742
you know that.

325
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,612
You believe that when
I say that right?

326
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:58,636
But,

327
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,883
it's out of my control.

328
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,085
- Coach, you can sue them.

329
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,888
- No, man, everybody
wants to file a lawsuit.

330
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,190
That's not me. I'm not
filing a lawsuit.

331
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:12,627
- So you're just gonna
sit back and accept it?

332
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:16,264
Just gonna sit back
and do nothing?

333
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,066
- No I'm actually
looking for a job, man.

334
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,468
- How's that job,

335
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:24,372
get you back on the
sidelines with us coach?

336
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,641
- I guess it doesn't Ron.

337
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,276
- You told us to never give up.

338
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,845
Go for our goals, our
dreams, everything.

339
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,747
And now look at you.

340
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,248
What are you gonna do?

341
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,883
- All that,

342
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,419
all that talk about us

343
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,855
being part of a team,

344
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:44,725
all that talk about us
being like your sons,

345
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,694
just talk right?

346
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,119
Just tough, talk.

347
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,973
- Seeing as life is
really complicated okay?

348
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,108
You don't know that
because you're

349
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:04,069
16, 17 years old
but, it really is.

350
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,083
Tried everything I could.

351
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:12,110
- I think it's pretty
simple, coach.

352
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,913
You always taught us,

353
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,047
to fight.

354
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,020
You always taught
us to play hard.

355
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:27,902
And now that it's time for
you to fight and play hard,

356
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,904
you just punk out.

357
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:30,928
- Punk out?

358
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,532
I love all you guys, but
you gotta go alright?

359
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,556
I'm...

360
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,071
I'm not your coach
anymore, okay?

361
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:07,165
- You kicking us out now?

362
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,767
- Come on.

363
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,629
- I knew you were nothing

364
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:29,653
but a fake,

365
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,167
white boy pretender.

366
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,427
- Man, get out of my house.

367
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,082
My house.

368
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,106
My house.

369
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:11,855
- Hey.

370
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,260
You're the swami.

371
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:20,007
You were right about
those games, you know?

372
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,209
- Yeah, you were right too,

373
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,079
I think I might need a lawyer.

374
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,171
- Let's talk.

375
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,116
- I saw your sign out there,

376
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,785
on the road,

377
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,353
and in the diner,

378
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,046
and then I found your card here.

379
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:42,897
Three times, do you know
the significance of that?

380
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,598
- I can't say that I do.

381
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:48,302
- Oh, it's the Holy Trinity,
Jesus died and then

382
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,538
rose on the third day,

383
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,307
there's 27 books of the Bible
which is three to the third

384
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,108
power...

385
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,477
- 66 books in the Bible.

386
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,501
- Right.

387
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:01,515
- 27 in the New Testament.

388
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:05,186
- Alright, well 66 is still
a multiple of three and

389
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,056
Jesus prayed three times in
the Garden of Gethsemane.

390
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,558
Before his arrest. - Okay.

391
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,859
- After that...
- Okay, okay

392
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,828
I get it. Three's a sign.

393
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:14,862
- Right.

394
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:15,886
- Look.

395
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:21,226
I don't even know if I
believe there is a God.

396
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:26,865
But I sure know you can't
pray with kids in schools.

397
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,010
- You ever try that?

398
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,445
- Praying?

399
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,469
Who hasn't?

400
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,750
- What'd you ask for?

401
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:37,751
- For what?

402
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:38,986
- For what?

403
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,288
- That I wouldn't have
a wife that cheated.

404
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:42,623
- And?

405
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,325
- I'm divorced.

406
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,694
- Because she cheated?

407
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:47,718
- No.

408
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,520
- You did.

409
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,664
- I don't think I can help you.

410
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,178
- Counselor, what do
you want most in life?

411
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,104
- Make money, be happy.

412
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,476
- Well, all I want to do,

413
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,279
is help kids.

414
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:18,016
I want to help boys become men.

415
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,795
To coach them and help them,
it's the only thing I know

416
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:22,963
how to do.

417
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:26,567
That's what I'm good
at, that's my calling

418
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,026
is to do that and

419
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,505
that's why I'm here right
now, is because a kid came

420
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,031
to me for help and

421
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,877
and I gave it to him,

422
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,980
the best way I know how, the
only way I knew how to help him

423
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,908
and they took everything
away from me for that.

424
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,414
So I'm here now asking

425
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,293
for your help,

426
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:55,429
and yeah, you would be putting
your neck out on the line,

427
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:58,132
but that's what I did for
somebody who needed help

428
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,592
and that's why I'm here so...

429
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,834
Come on, let's
make some history.

430
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,734
- I need a retainer.

431
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:36,637
Up front in case you
have a crisis of faith.

432
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,039
I'll do the rest on contingency.

433
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,999
- How much do you need?

434
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,267
- $10,500.

435
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,003
- Mr. Brown, I'm unemployed,
I don't have access to

436
00:31:47,027 --> 00:31:48,595
that kind of money.

437
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,177
- I can't do it for free, swami.

438
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,989
- Would you take $5000, Mr.
Brown?

439
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,690
- Michael?

440
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,872
- What are you doing here?

441
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,607
How did you know where I was?

442
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,634
- Do you realize
what you are doing?

443
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:53,781
I just want to pay my score.

444
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,616
They're gonna make me
tell them everything.

445
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,141
Everything I know.

446
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,421
You should check your office.

447
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,555
- Why?

448
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,058
- They left a message.

449
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,849
- You know you give
a person a chance

450
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,618
and they just take advantage
of you, today you just

451
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,287
can't be nice, didn't want
to listen to the pretty face

452
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,722
that you got involved,

453
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,492
after you knew your
line was closed.

454
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,394
I want my money.

455
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,362
And whatever happens to
the people you love,

456
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,621
that's all you.

457
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,484
- We should go, get out of here.

458
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:38,508
- Go?

459
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,354
Go where?

460
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,547
- Anywhere, just not here.

461
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,584
A vacation, hm?

462
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,207
I mean you spend all your
time around these old things

463
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:52,299
nobody wants.

464
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,636
- Oh, so I guess
I'm nobody, huh?

465
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,038
- Well I didn't mean nobody.

466
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:02,209
I just meant we should
be, more spontaneous.

467
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,233
Leave.

468
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,146
- I have to work.

469
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,772
- You own the shop.

470
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,509
- And I need $10,400 remember?

471
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:14,979
- I remember.

472
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:19,092
But a few days won't hurt.

473
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:22,463
I mean the case is gonna
be settled real soon.

474
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,487
- It will?

475
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,489
- It will.

476
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,506
- Michael look at me.

477
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,576
In my eyes and tell me you
think this case is gonna

478
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,934
be settled soon.

479
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,870
- It will.

480
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,585
- We're the same.

481
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,010
Exactly same DNA.

482
00:35:49,157 --> 00:35:50,157
- It will.

483
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,182
- Michael...

484
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,995
- This is a...

485
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,855
- I've known about
it for a while.

486
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,635
I just wanted to see how
long it was gonna take

487
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,994
for you to tell me about it.

488
00:36:42,043 --> 00:36:43,043
- Why didn't you...

489
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,067
- Why?

490
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,084
Because with people you love,

491
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:53,611
you tend to be more forgiving.

492
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:59,159
But I just kept hoping that
you would do something,

493
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,595
do something to make it right.

494
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,619
- Laurel...

495
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,239
- And you want me to leave,

496
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:13,273
my life.

497
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,842
You look around here and

498
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:19,112
you see old stuff,
but I see treasures.

499
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:22,683
The people who made
all this stuff,

500
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:26,253
they've long since passed,
but what they put their

501
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:27,277
hands to

502
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,447
is treasure.

503
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:36,430
That's their legacy and I
used to have one of my own.

504
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:40,124
That died in that car
accident, so right now.

505
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:44,838
I just want to make
their legacy live on

506
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:45,862
right here.

507
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,336
So no, I don't need a vacation.

508
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,406
I am where I need to be.

509
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,320
- I'll pay you back.

510
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,344
Every cent.

511
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,886
- I have to work.

512
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,991
- Laurel, I'll pay you back.

513
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:15,925
I promise.

514
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,730
I promise.

515
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:31,941
- Oh God.

516
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,324
- That's my sister, my heart.

517
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,893
I did this to her,
I got to fix it.

518
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,352
I'm gonna fix it.

519
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:43,753
Watch me.

520
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,006
- I pledge allegiance

521
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:56,109
to the flag of the United
States of America,

522
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:59,112
and to the republic
for which it stands

523
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:03,383
one nation indivisible with
liberty and justice for all.

524
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:04,742
Have a nice day.

525
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:06,777
- Under God.

526
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,114
- Do I know you?

527
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:12,583
- Under God.

528
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,596
One nation under God.

529
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,633
Approved by Congress in 1954,

530
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:23,828
is there a specific reason
you excluded that phrase?

531
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,333
Oh, you've been served,

532
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,913
by Michael Brown,
attorney at law.

533
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:35,539
Mr. Paul will see you in court.

534
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,158
- And the plaintiff should
be allowed a hearing

535
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:47,027
for immediate reinstatement.

536
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,930
My client's season will be
nearly over in 60 days,

537
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,098
your Honor.

538
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,433
- My client needs more
time for discovery.

539
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,102
We need more time.

540
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,803
Six months is what
we're thinking.

541
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,138
- Six...

542
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:01,208
Your Honor, this hearing
should take place this week.

543
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,577
- That's not feasible and
besides that's absurd.

544
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,112
- That is not absurd...

545
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,147
- I have heard from both
of you upwards of an hour,

546
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:09,349
you want to forever try the
case to make the plaintiff

547
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:10,917
suffer, and you

548
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:13,061
want to catch them with their
pants down so they can't

549
00:40:13,085 --> 00:40:14,755
prepare properly.

550
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,624
Both positions strategically
valid, both positions

551
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:18,992
logically flawed.

552
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:22,229
Gentlemen, you have 30 days
to complete discovery.

553
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,064
Trial begins in another 30 days,

554
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,466
I'm sorry if you're client
has to miss his basketball

555
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:30,237
season but my docket does not
revolve around basketball.

556
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,021
And I'm sorry if you're
client has to work to

557
00:40:32,045 --> 00:40:34,574
prepare for trial but
sometimes counselor,

558
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,877
that's the way it goes.

559
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,636
Thank you, gentlemen.

560
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:40,580
- Thank you your Honor.

561
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,481
- Thank you your Honor.

562
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:42,907
- You're welcome.

563
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,267
- I had hoped you'd be a
little more sympathetic

564
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,893
to my client's case your Honor.

565
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:07,174
- I am a man of both fact
and faith Mr. Brown,

566
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,709
and I would suggest you
find a strong dose of both

567
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,836
before this trial begins.

568
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,135
- I'm Joseph T.
Herrington, trial lawyer,

569
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,804
Judge Rogers asked that I,

570
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,740
that we intervene and bring
our two hundred years

571
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:43,043
of collective
experience to bare.

572
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,469
Now who is this lawyer who is

573
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,406
shaking a stick in the beehive.

574
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,688
Smart, filed a

575
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:57,290
claim for retaliation.

576
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:01,261
Doesn't depend on the success
of the underlying claim.

577
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,353
Nevertheless.

578
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,942
Michael Brown, Yale Law in 1985,

579
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:19,513
three disciplinary complaints,
suspended for six months,

580
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,748
last chance reinstatement.

581
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,550
Misses deadlines.

582
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:27,520
Last five years filed
65 cases, 58 settle,

583
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:29,322
three lost at trial,

584
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:33,017
two dismissed due to
lack of prosecution and

585
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:36,930
one little victory for a
rear end car accident,

586
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:37,955
verdict, uh,

587
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,190
$2,500

588
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:47,474
We will not simply
scorch the earth,

589
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:50,610
they'll be no settlement,
they'll be no compromise,

590
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,469
they'll be no way out.

591
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,470
Still,

592
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,784
you go get me a

593
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:00,353
settlement conference with Mr.

594
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:01,545
Michael Brown.

595
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:12,856
- Aiden Paul?

596
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:17,293
Aiden?

597
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:35,257
- The first amendment does
not give coaches the right

598
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:37,657
to impose their religion
on their students either.

599
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,592
Coaches are
government employees,

600
00:43:39,616 --> 00:43:42,095
when they are coaching, they
are bound by the establishment

601
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,097
clause of the first amendment.

602
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,000
This means that they cannot
encourage, organize,

603
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,702
or participate in prayer.

604
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,670
When they get home,
they can pray,

605
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:54,865
but whenever they coach,
they coach and not preach.

606
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,947
- You know, you've managed
to divide the community

607
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,682
in a way I haven't
seen I a while.

608
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:05,919
Your resume is impressive
but I must say,

609
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,854
and I'm not one to
beat around the bush,

610
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:11,782
there is no one in the
state who will hire you.

611
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,857
- Aiden Paul?

612
00:44:21,135 --> 00:44:22,135
- Good afternoon.

613
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,604
- How may I help you?

614
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:27,741
- This is my first time here,
so I don't really know what

615
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:31,945
to do but I have to apply
for unemployment benefits.

616
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,914
- Fill out these forms and
wait over there. Next.

617
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:37,984
- Ma'am, I'm sorry I'm not
trying to violate any thing,

618
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:42,179
but I've just been waiting
in line for three hours.

619
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:48,118
- Denied.

620
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,627
- You lost Michael.

621
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,330
Don't let this escalate.

622
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:06,379
It won't be good
for either of us.

623
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:08,238
- I'll have the money.

624
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,751
Long before it's due.

625
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:12,775
Guaranteed.

626
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:44,507
- Hi.

627
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,220
- Hey.

628
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,155
I've been looking for
you for over a week.

629
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,523
Trial's around the corner,

630
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:53,193
I'm meeting with the defense
in less than 24 hours.

631
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:54,094
- I've been busy.

632
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,361
- Your phones off.

633
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:57,105
- I'm staying at a
friend's house right now.

634
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,898
And I don't need
that extra bill.

635
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,870
- Well good news and
bad, which first?

636
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,305
- Um,

637
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,372
I don't know why don't we
let the good news drown out

638
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,274
the bad news?

639
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:09,743
- Alright bad.

640
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,579
The firm of Herrington Smith
and Hail took over the case.

641
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,748
We drew the partner Joseph
Herrington, he's tough.

642
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:18,685
Hasn't lost a trial in 20 years.

643
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,620
- So we can't win?

644
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:22,722
- Oh yeah, yeah we can beat him.

645
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:24,224
But we may not have to.

646
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,458
That's the good news.

647
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:28,719
They called, wanted
to talk settlement.

648
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,464
- Well that's...

649
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:33,433
That's a good thing, right?

650
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,526
- Good? That's very good.

651
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:38,805
- See I pushed for this
trial to come up fast,

652
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,273
that put pressure on them,

653
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,257
they don't want to put their
resources in this and

654
00:46:42,281 --> 00:46:44,878
know that it's bad PR so,

655
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:47,671
they want me to
come by tomorrow.

656
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:52,652
- Like a get my job back,
like very soon, good thing?

657
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:55,555
- I told them if getting your
job back wasn't on the table

658
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:56,923
we wouldn't talk.

659
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,958
They said let's talk.

660
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,251
It'll all be over tomorrow.

661
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,910
- Sorry, after conferring
with my client we decline to

662
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,101
make an offer.

663
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,321
- You never had any
plans to settle.

664
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,658
That's considered deception,
deceit, old fashioned lying.

665
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,927
- I did no such thing, there's
always a possibility,

666
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:37,497
albeit a lower than
slight chance, but

667
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,189
anything's possible.

668
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:41,457
- Well.

669
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:46,539
If that's the way you
want to play it.

670
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:49,709
- You're really not gonna
dismiss this suit are you?

671
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,010
- I don't quit.

672
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,413
- After you learn a few
things about your client,

673
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:56,950
I'm sure that withdrawing
might be a smart move.

674
00:47:56,974 --> 00:48:00,978
- Patience prevents me
from folding prematurely.

675
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,624
- I got to give you
a little credit.

676
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,060
Realizing that if you argue
the merits that the actual

677
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:11,097
constitutionality, the
prayer, you lose so instead,

678
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:12,632
you plead retaliation.

679
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:15,401
That may get you an A in
my common law class but

680
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:19,372
in the end, these are
little consequence here.

681
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,040
- That's presumptuous.

682
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,499
- Provatic maybe.

683
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:24,867
Reality is

684
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,337
if you argue prayer,

685
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:29,939
you lose.

686
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:35,989
- I'll take that
under consideration.

687
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:39,092
- You realize this trial
starts in two weeks?

688
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,860
Per your request?

689
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,129
- That's fine counselor.

690
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:45,198
I wouldn't mind
hastening the headline,

691
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:47,734
Joseph Herrington loses.

692
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,259
Now that headline,

693
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,361
I'd toiler for.

694
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,429
- T.

695
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,366
Joseph T. Herrington.

696
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,045
Not Joseph Herrington
the plumber,

697
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,880
Joseph Herrington
sanitary worker,

698
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:03,883
Joseph T Herrington, litigator,

699
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:05,685
that's something you
seem to forget.

700
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,821
There will be no settlement.

701
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,456
- Very well.

702
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,215
Joseph Herrington. T.

703
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,563
- With your client and his
lawyer, I would expect this

704
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:21,034
to be the shortest
deliberation in history.

705
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,058
We're done.

706
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:39,552
- $5,000.

707
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:40,576
One hand.

708
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:33,099
I wasn't sure if I
should run or slug you.

709
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,163
- You said that you wanted
to talk so I hope you got

710
00:51:35,187 --> 00:51:36,235
some good news for me.

711
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,870
- You should've made
an appointment.

712
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:39,806
My life doesn't revolve
around this case.

713
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:43,309
- I never seen another soul
anywhere near this office.

714
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,378
Hopefully we'll just be
back to normal living,

715
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,042
you know as soon as we
get the settlement.

716
00:51:47,066 --> 00:51:48,667
Thank God for that.

717
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:55,254
- You lost your job,
your house, your team,

718
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,422
your record,

719
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,115
still you thank God.

720
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:03,587
You lost your job for praying.

721
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:08,201
If prayer was so powerful,
wouldn't you still be working?

722
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:09,335
- What am I supposed to do?

723
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,971
Just be faithful when I am

724
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:13,830
rolling in the riches,

725
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:15,865
balling,

726
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:17,833
on top.

727
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,805
- They're not settling.

728
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,212
- They're not settling?

729
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,649
- They're not settling.

730
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:35,804
- That's funny because I
thought that you told me

731
00:52:35,828 --> 00:52:37,563
they called you

732
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:41,167
and said that they
wanted to settle.

733
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,735
- They called,

734
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,203
but they snuck me.

735
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:45,228
- Snuck you?

736
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:50,910
Oh I see so they outsmarted
you is what you're saying.

737
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:53,813
- Say it any way you want.

738
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,339
But that's not the worst part.

739
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:59,619
- That's not the worst part?

740
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,054
What's the worst part?

741
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:06,359
- No matter what happens,
just keep praying right?

742
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:09,061
- Why don't you go ahead and
tell me the worst part?

743
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:10,085
- Look,

744
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:12,798
you see that stack of
motions they filed.

745
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:16,593
That's 50 grand in fees
sitting on that desk.

746
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:21,407
- Where's your stack of motions?

747
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:22,875
- You didn't pay me 50 grand.

748
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:26,403
- Well what is five
grand stack look like?

749
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:32,542
That's really it?

750
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,054
That's really it?

751
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:36,756
- And there's more.

752
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,780
- More?

753
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:40,726
Oh there's more?

754
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:41,750
- More.

755
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:46,790
- There's even more. Wow.

756
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,078
- You should've told me.

757
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:01,771
- This is supposed to be sealed.

758
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,120
Why are you handing me this?

759
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:10,723
This is sealed.

760
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:11,891
This is sealed record.

761
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,826
- If that gets in.

762
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,061
You can't win.

763
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,796
- What do you mean
if it gets in?

764
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,060
It's not supposed to be in,
it's not supposed to be here,

765
00:54:19,084 --> 00:54:21,534
you're not supposed, no one is
ever supposed to be able to

766
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:22,868
look at this.

767
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:25,829
Because it's supposed
to be sealed.

768
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:30,409
We're dropping this lawsuit
right now, do you understand?

769
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,277
- Drop it?

770
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:32,211
- Yeah. I can't go to trial

771
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:33,479
with a lawyer... - They have it!

772
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,263
- Who can't keep something
that was sealed as

773
00:54:35,287 --> 00:54:38,651
a minor record.
- Their money unsealed it.

774
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,515
- There's no way this
should be here right now,

775
00:54:40,539 --> 00:54:41,587
do you understand?

776
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,122
There's no way.

777
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:44,557
- So you just want to drop it?

778
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:45,691
- Yeah, that's right.

779
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,326
- All my time.

780
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,261
The kids are important.

781
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:51,030
Et cetera and so forth.

782
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:53,099
You know I don't get you, swami.

783
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,457
I don't get you.

784
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,471
One minute you're all about
prayer and the next minute

785
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,172
you're ready to quit.

786
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:02,274
- Ready to quit?

787
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:04,810
- I'm not quitting anything,
I'm getting out of suicide

788
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,846
right now, that's
what I'm doing.

789
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:09,015
I lost my job, I lost my
bike, I lost my house,

790
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,384
I lost my living, I
lost everything.

791
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:13,048
And all I keep... I'm
waiting for answers,

792
00:55:13,072 --> 00:55:15,054
all I keep getting is you,
sitting here telling me

793
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:16,288
it gets worse.

794
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:19,191
Oh they outsmarted me. Oh.

795
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:21,427
You're sealed record from
when you were 10 years old

796
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:25,097
is now public because they
have money and we don't.

797
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,356
- That's right.

798
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:31,904
I tell you this so you know
what we're up against.

799
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:35,532
I tell you this so that
you can understand,

800
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,535
they're playing for keeps.

801
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:40,969
You get it?

802
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,173
You get it?

803
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:46,810
And all you got is me.

804
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,079
Hm, me.

805
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:53,526
The only person crazy
enough or desperate enough

806
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,561
to take your case.

807
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:58,197
The only person who's willing
to stick their neck out

808
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,031
for you.

809
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:00,890
The only person who...

810
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,173
You can't quit.

811
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,365
We can't quit.

812
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,911
I didn't tell you this to quit.

813
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:14,037
I told you this to fight!

814
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:21,454
Now you asked me
something the other day.

815
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,255
You asked me did I
want to make history,

816
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:26,158
well I'm telling you now.

817
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:27,784
Let's make history.

818
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:32,522
- What are we gonna do
about this, Mr. Brown?

819
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,336
- Mr. Brown?

820
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,351
- Ladies and gentlemen,

821
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:40,800
our legal system trust the
community to enforce the law.

822
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,326
Today, you are that community,

823
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,106
your job is important.

824
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,965
And relatively simple.

825
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:54,747
You have to decide if Aiden
Paul violated a rule,

826
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:58,708
and whether any violation
deserved termination.

827
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:01,577
Now,

828
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:06,325
they will tell you that Mr.
Paul was terminated for

829
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,184
praying with a player,

830
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:14,066
and that that prayer constituted
a violation of policy,

831
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,835
and for that,

832
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:17,760
termination was proper.

833
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,564
And then you'll hear the truth.

834
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:27,203
The truth is,

835
00:58:28,504 --> 00:58:31,650
that Mr. Paul threatened
to report the school's

836
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:34,854
principal's violations
to the Board,

837
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:38,114
and later, that same
day, he was fired.

838
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:49,792
Those are the facts
ladies and gentlemen.

839
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:52,394
At the end,

840
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:06,642
actually,

841
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:10,723
the reason we're here

842
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:11,747
is prayer.

843
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:17,186
And where you believe

844
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:20,189
it's greatest value lies.

845
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:24,426
Thank you.

846
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:34,246
- Oh.

847
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,270
The truth.

848
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,240
The truth.

849
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:43,155
You know, when
someone tells you,

850
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:47,326
they declare that they rely
on the truth all too often,

851
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,352
in actuality, the truth,

852
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:51,688
it evades them.

853
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,502
Because they're so
blinded by their

854
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:59,462
passionate stand
of their position.

855
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:06,111
Now I have no doubt that Mr.
Brown believes his client's

856
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:09,572
position carries the
shield of the truth.

857
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:15,311
But reality is far
from that barometer.

858
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:20,059
You see in 1962, our
Supreme Court held

859
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:24,229
that teacher led prayer
is unconstitutional.

860
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:26,999
I'm gonna say it again,
listen very carefully.

861
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:30,860
The Supreme Court held
that teacher led prayer

862
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:35,898
is unconstitutional.

863
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:42,214
Opening up prayer in school
is akin to opening up.

864
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,817
Pandora's box, why,
because we don't want

865
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:48,487
our children indoctrinated
with whatever religion,

866
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:52,091
whatever religion, just
happens to be popular

867
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:52,925
at the moment.

868
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,017
So we say no.

869
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:58,731
You want to discuss those things,
you want to ask questions

870
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:02,034
you do it inside your own home.

871
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,894
The separation of
church and state

872
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,830
is an enforceable,

873
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:10,566
constitutional

874
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:12,467
principle.

875
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:18,708
Mr. Paul very simply,
violated that principle,

876
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,779
and the school,

877
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:27,216
they terminated him
for doing such.

878
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:35,134
That termination, you know
what that termination does?

879
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:38,470
It protects our children
from the undue influence of

880
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:41,840
people who happen to be popular.

881
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,943
People that our children
look up to like Mr. Paul

882
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,303
who will do anything to win.

883
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:53,475
Influence.

884
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,547
People who influence
our children.

885
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:05,354
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, with that verdict.

886
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:09,935
I want you to inform
the plaintiff,

887
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:13,572
I want you to inform Mr.
Paul that we as a community

888
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:16,332
we respect and we
uphold the law.

889
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:24,006
No matter how many
athletic events

890
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:30,613
you may coach to victory.

891
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:33,048
We respect,

892
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:40,189
and we uphold the law.

893
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,430
Thank you.

894
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:03,722
- Your Honor,

895
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:07,183
plaintiff calls Kurt
Rogers to the stand.

896
01:03:34,704 --> 01:03:36,744
- It has been brought to the
court's attention that.

897
01:03:36,768 --> 01:03:39,625
Mr. Kurt Rodgers was never
properly served a subpoena

898
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,194
to testify in court today.

899
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:45,664
- Judge I was informed by the
witness that he would testify

900
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:47,065
today,

901
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:50,569
but I would move to admit
his deposition testimony.

902
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:53,038
- Your Honor we object to the
admission of this deposition,

903
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:55,240
we were not informed of
the deposition because.

904
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:58,477
Mr. Brown deprived the
defense the opportunity to

905
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:01,446
cross examine the witness, the
deposition is inadmissible

906
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,372
hearsay under rule 801.

907
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,918
- Mr. Brown?

908
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,687
- I anticipated the witness
would be here to testify

909
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:09,711
your Honor.

910
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:13,225
- Not good enough.

911
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:15,289
If the defense did not have
the opportunity to cross

912
01:04:15,313 --> 01:04:17,696
examine the witness,
the testimony,

913
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,388
it's not admissible.

914
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:30,976
- Your Honor, these witnesses
are inappropriate.

915
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,412
The facts of this case
turn on whether Mr. Paul's

916
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:36,715
termination was a violation
of school policy.

917
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:38,819
- Your Honor, is counsel
gonna allow us to put on our

918
01:04:38,843 --> 01:04:41,920
case or continue these jack
in the box objections?

919
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:46,115
- Is opposing counsel gonna
adhere to one single rule?

920
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:50,195
- I agree with Mr. Herrington,
this case is not about.

921
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,798
Mr. Paul's character, it
is only about whether he

922
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:55,100
was terminated for
violating a rule,

923
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:57,703
or for pretexual reason.

924
01:04:58,561 --> 01:04:59,629
Next witness.

925
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:06,578
- Mr. Patterson, you
claimed that Coach Paul

926
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:09,681
was terminated for
praying with a student?

927
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:11,984
- That's correct, yes.

928
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:15,487
- Isn't it true that on the
same day he was terminated,

929
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:18,590
he informed you that he was
going to report you to the.

930
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:22,527
Board for the misallocation of
funds assigned to the team?

931
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,062
- Not in that way, no.

932
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,530
- In what way then Mr.
Patterson?

933
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:26,656
- I recall he

934
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:30,135
mentioned some kind
of a complaint, but

935
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,704
I don't recall him
threatening me to

936
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:36,408
threatening to report
me to my superiors, no.

937
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,211
- But if he was to do so on
the same day that he was

938
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:40,579
terminated,

939
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,048
it would look pretty bad
for you wouldn't it?

940
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:45,284
- Yeah, if you say so.

941
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:46,818
- Well did you?

942
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:47,719
- Did I what?

943
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:49,888
- Did you miss allocate funds?

944
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:52,224
- Absolutely not, sir,
and I'm insulted.

945
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:55,160
- Oh I'm so sorry
to insult you, sir.

946
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:56,962
Do you need a moment
to gather yourself?

947
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:57,796
- Objection your Honor.

948
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,097
Argumentative.

949
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,466
- Sustained. That statement
will be stricken.

950
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:04,269
- Mr. Patterson praying
with a student

951
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,038
is not a terminable
offense is it?

952
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:07,063
- Yes it is.

953
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,043
- According to your policies,

954
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:15,147
conviction of a felony,
forgery, falsifying records,

955
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:19,017
stealing, fighting, immoral
or indecent conduct,

956
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,520
these are listed as
terminable offenses,

957
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:25,590
and funny thing is, there's
no mention of prayer.

958
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:28,126
- It's not specifically
stated, I'll give you that,

959
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:31,153
it's assumed under
indecent conduct.

960
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:34,666
- I'm sorry.

961
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,703
Are you saying that your
school district categorizes

962
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:39,962
prayer as indecent conduct?

963
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:45,410
- Yes, but not in the way
you may think however.

964
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:48,313
- Well pray tell
how do you do so?

965
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,582
- Indecent defined as
not being the norm,

966
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:53,676
not fitting, not
indecent as obscene.

967
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:56,822
- The definition that
you're relying upon,

968
01:06:56,846 --> 01:07:00,292
this definition is written
in your policies?

969
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:01,126
- No I don't think...

970
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,385
- No it is not.

971
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:08,133
You would agree, Mr. Patterson,
that being transgender

972
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:09,534
is not the norm?

973
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:11,136
- Honor, objection.

974
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,938
- A little grace your Honor.

975
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:14,206
- Very little.

976
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,540
- Yes I would agree.

977
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:18,410
- And there is a transgender
teacher working at your

978
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:22,147
school, and a parent complained
because this teacher

979
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:24,483
discussed it with a student.

980
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:25,851
- I believe that's true, yes.

981
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,487
- And according to
your definition,

982
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:32,190
not being the norm
is indecent, right?

983
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,493
- According to that
logic, I guess.

984
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:37,028
- And that teacher
still teaches, yes?

985
01:07:37,052 --> 01:07:39,064
- Mr. Brown, precisely
what is your point?

986
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:42,834
- My point is that you chose
to terminate Coach Paul

987
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:46,004
for praying with a student
but you chose not to

988
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:49,141
terminate a transgender
teacher who discussed

989
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:52,168
their sexual identity
with students.

990
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:54,136
Mr. Patterson.

991
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:59,418
Tolerance and
understanding is a river,

992
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:02,378
that flows both up
stream and down.

993
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:04,980
Does it not?

994
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:30,172
- Guard said it's about
that time, he's locking up.

995
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:37,556
- My mentor was never allowed
to enter the room down there.

996
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:40,292
He and everyone that looked
like him were forced to

997
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:41,317
sit up here.

998
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,487
Argue from the balcony.

999
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:47,255
Separate.

1000
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:53,162
- Shackled by stupidity, huh?

1001
01:08:55,164 --> 01:08:57,166
- Shackled by stupidity.

1002
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:03,072
- So I'm up tomorrow?

1003
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,543
- It comes down to you.

1004
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:14,092
- They can't bring up the
things about the past?

1005
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:16,285
- No I don't think so, but

1006
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:18,888
don't open the door.

1007
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:26,805
I thought you said at the
beginning of this thing that

1008
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:29,207
if we argue prayer's
okay at any time,

1009
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:31,810
then we're gonna lose?

1010
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:32,834
100%.

1011
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:41,042
- We might.

1012
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:48,551
But what are we
really fighting for?

1013
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,019
Just a job.

1014
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:53,923
- History, right?

1015
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:59,137
- History remembers those who

1016
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:01,597
win in a spectacular fashion.

1017
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:04,767
Or lose in the same way.

1018
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:12,274
Either way, you and I
will be remembered.

1019
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:25,821
- Coach?

1020
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:28,257
Hey old man.

1021
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:35,040
- We know you gotta
take the stand.

1022
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:39,811
- And we know you've kind of
always had our backs and...

1023
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:42,280
- We wanted to have your back.

1024
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:43,784
- Just don't let them
shake you coach.

1025
01:10:43,808 --> 01:10:47,352
You know they say a solid
d wins championships.

1026
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:50,112
- Hey man, I
appreciate it, guys.

1027
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,194
What we in a huddle now?

1028
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:58,530
What we gonna do? Do we fight?
We fight.

1029
01:10:58,554 --> 01:10:59,698
- We fight.

1030
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:00,865
- We fight.
- We fight.

1031
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:02,033
- We fight.
- We fight.

1032
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:03,201
- We fight.
- We fight.

1033
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:04,369
- We fight.
- We fight.

1034
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:05,537
- We fight.
- We fight.

1035
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:06,504
- We fight.
- We fight.

1036
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,106
- Amen.
- Amen.

1037
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:13,602
- You guys, thank
you for coming.

1038
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,474
- What? They followed me.

1039
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,010
What can I say?

1040
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:06,564
You were terminated, for praying
with one of the students

1041
01:12:06,588 --> 01:12:08,867
and that that
violated the rules.

1042
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:13,171
Did you or did you not
pray with Kurt Rodgers?

1043
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:14,195
- I did.

1044
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:18,132
- And why?

1045
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:23,672
- I did it because I
recognized pain in his eyes.

1046
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,175
I knew it.

1047
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,110
And

1048
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:33,958
so then I made a choice to
help one of my players.

1049
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:35,050
That was all.

1050
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,569
- You do understand that
not everyone believes

1051
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:46,371
prayer helps?

1052
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:49,374
- I'm not concerned with
what everyone believes,

1053
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:50,809
or what everyone thinks.

1054
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,753
I just know that I'm the
only person who's walked

1055
01:12:52,777 --> 01:12:54,879
a mile in my own shoes,

1056
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:55,903
and I know

1057
01:12:57,506 --> 01:13:01,243
the hopelessness of a
life without any faith,

1058
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:08,250
know what that can be like.

1059
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,930
Everything I do, and
everything I did

1060
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:13,498
was to

1061
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:17,626
help my players, and help
them become better men.

1062
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:23,298
- Your witness.

1063
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:29,180
- You understood that prayer in
school is against the rules?

1064
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:30,515
- No I didn't.

1065
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:33,618
The constitution guarantees
my right to free speech.

1066
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:34,919
Period.

1067
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:37,989
- Strain lay interpretation
be that as it may,

1068
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:39,748
is it your claim that

1069
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:42,050
prayer helps,

1070
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:44,352
helps.

1071
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:47,723
That prayer has helped you.

1072
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:50,335
- Yeah.

1073
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:52,604
- Helped you as a child?

1074
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:54,038
- Uh huh.

1075
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:57,766
- Prayer's helped you as far
back as you can remember?

1076
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:00,879
- I've been praying
all my life and

1077
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:04,482
it has always helped me
through troubles yes.

1078
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:06,985
- In 1991, when you
were 10 did you...

1079
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:08,920
- Objection, your Honor.

1080
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,556
This is case is not about Mr.
Paul's character,

1081
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,324
as a child or an adult.

1082
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:15,560
The facts of this case
turn on whether Mr. Paul's

1083
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:19,030
termination was a violation
of school policy and

1084
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:21,232
I quote Mr. Herrington.

1085
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:22,656
- He has you there Mr.
Herrington...

1086
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,640
- Counselor's just a tad
late with that objection,

1087
01:14:24,664 --> 01:14:28,039
Mr. Paul is the one who opened
up the door to his past,

1088
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:32,134
on a principle that prayer
has always helped him.

1089
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:43,644
In 1991,

1090
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:48,617
were you arrested for murder?

1091
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:54,494
Don't look at your counsel,
he can't answer that for you,

1092
01:14:54,518 --> 01:14:55,962
you're up there all on your own.

1093
01:14:55,986 --> 01:14:58,927
In 1991, were you
arrested for murder?

1094
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:04,676
- I was.

1095
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,846
- And did pray help you then?

1096
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:08,870
- It did.

1097
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:12,717
- Did prayer help you when you

1098
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:16,387
pushed a man through
a glass window?

1099
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:17,411
- Yeah.

1100
01:15:20,382 --> 01:15:22,827
- Did prayer help you when
you punched the man and you

1101
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,119
broke his nose?

1102
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:33,629
Did prayer help you when you
shot and killed the man?

1103
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:36,798
Your very own father?

1104
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:45,316
- Thank you Lord that you
will redeem my soul in peace

1105
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,885
from the battle
that is against me.

1106
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:47,952
- I'm sorry I can't,

1107
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:48,853
I'm standing right
here, I can't hear it,

1108
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:50,321
could you speak up?

1109
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:53,057
- Thank you Lord that you
will redeem my soul in peace,

1110
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:54,441
from the battle
that is against me.

1111
01:15:54,465 --> 01:15:56,065
- Your Honor, please
instruct the witness

1112
01:15:56,089 --> 01:15:57,996
to answer the questions before?

1113
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,265
- Please, sir, answer the
counsel's questions.

1114
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:02,624
- His questions, yeah I did.

1115
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,294
It did help me then.

1116
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:08,539
- That's the same help,
that you were giving Kurt

1117
01:16:08,563 --> 01:16:10,775
regarding his father.

1118
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:12,534
No further questions.

1119
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:38,593
- Counsel?

1120
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:44,433
- The plaintiff calls Nona Paul.

1121
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:47,845
- What are you doing?

1122
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:51,316
- She called, said
it's her last chance.

1123
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,884
- You should've
told me about this.

1124
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:53,751
I don't like this at all.

1125
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:56,020
- Just trust me.

1126
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:39,755
- It's time.

1127
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:42,924
It's my turn.

1128
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,806
- Did Aiden shoot his father?

1129
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:00,342
- No. No he didn't.

1130
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:06,557
- Did he say he did?

1131
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:08,893
- Objection.

1132
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:10,585
- Overruled.

1133
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:15,757
- Yes, yes he did.

1134
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:20,896
- Ms. Paul, in your own words,

1135
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:24,842
tell us what
happened that night.

1136
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:26,701
- I was a drug addict.

1137
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:29,538
I had two strikes.

1138
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:34,375
His father,

1139
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:37,379
was a horrible,

1140
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:39,948
violent man.

1141
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:46,221
He and his friends would
do terrible things to me.

1142
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:52,561
Things a child should
never have to see.

1143
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:57,265
Aiden was always my protector.

1144
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:02,671
Until that night.

1145
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:06,842
That night, his
father went after,

1146
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:08,776
Aiden,

1147
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:15,059
and I decided in a split
second, I would do,

1148
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:17,085
what I knew I had to do.

1149
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:33,635
- What did you mean by
coming after Aiden?

1150
01:19:38,773 --> 01:19:40,675
No need to answer that.

1151
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:56,534
- Your mother has cancer.

1152
01:19:56,558 --> 01:20:01,172
Small cell carcinoma, it's a
very invasive type of cancer.

1153
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:02,196
I'm sorry.

1154
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:06,677
- Come together
they asked of him,

1155
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:09,947
saying Lord we'll doubt
this time restore again

1156
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:12,350
in the kingdom to Israel.

1157
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:14,285
And he said unto them,

1158
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:17,188
it's not for you to know
the times or the seasons

1159
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:20,958
which the Father hath
put in his own power,

1160
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,894
but you shall receive power.

1161
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:25,654
- Can you forgive me?

1162
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:37,175
- I was just a little kid.

1163
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,701
And you left me in the system.

1164
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:47,876
I grew up in foster homes.

1165
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:51,746
You never even came to visit me.

1166
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:55,183
- I was a coward.

1167
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:01,790
Simple as that.

1168
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:08,897
Facing you everyday, I,

1169
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:14,202
it was facing my failure.

1170
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:18,539
My fear.

1171
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:23,678
You are everything I
wish I could have been.

1172
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:33,831
I don't deserve
your forgiveness,

1173
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:35,900
I don't deserve your love.

1174
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:38,035
- Yeah you do, I
want you to have it.

1175
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:41,296
You do deserve it,
you already have it.

1176
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:44,275
You're forgiven okay?

1177
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:46,244
I forgive you.

1178
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,846
I don't even care, I just want

1179
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:51,106
I just want you to be here.

1180
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:55,710
I just want you to be here.

1181
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:02,860
- Well Mr. Brown, we
find ourselves in

1182
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:04,328
a precarious position.

1183
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:06,697
Here's the promise, don't have
my money by the end of the

1184
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:09,557
day, that email
becomes a reality.

1185
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,796
- Counsel?

1186
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,823
Are you ready for
closing arguments?

1187
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:24,208
- He's pointing to you.

1188
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:27,945
- Mr. Brown is the
plaintiff ready?

1189
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:29,070
- Your Honor,

1190
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:34,318
I need a recess for a day.

1191
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:35,343
- Objection.

1192
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:39,590
- This jury has been patient
and I will not make them

1193
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:40,992
wait another day.

1194
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:43,694
- Your Honor, I have to
attend to a personal matter,

1195
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:46,955
of extreme urgency
and I have to do it,

1196
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:49,400
right now.

1197
01:23:49,424 --> 01:23:52,203
- Your Honor if he had a matter
of such grave importance

1198
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:55,573
he should've addressed
it before today.

1199
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:59,110
- Mr. Brown, I find this last
minute request to be both

1200
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:00,611
unprofessional and discourteous,

1201
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:02,913
Mr. Herrington, are you ready
for closing arguments?

1202
01:24:02,937 --> 01:24:05,049
- Prepared your Honor.

1203
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:08,085
- It is time for your closing Mr.
Brown, now.

1204
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:12,289
- With all due respect your
Honor, to you and to the jury.

1205
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:16,151
I will not be doing my
closing argument today.

1206
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:19,619
There are some things
even more important than

1207
01:24:19,643 --> 01:24:20,978
our convenience,

1208
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:24,368
or even the rule of law.

1209
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:27,796
Today I'm faced with
one of those things.

1210
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:32,333
Please forgive me.

1211
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:34,912
I'll be ready tomorrow.

1212
01:24:34,936 --> 01:24:36,080
- Mr. Brown.

1213
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:39,183
Mr. Brown! If you step
into that gallery,

1214
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:41,118
I'll order you arrest
and held in contempt

1215
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:42,987
of court, this is my courtroom.

1216
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:44,989
And you will be
held accountable.

1217
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:46,624
In my court, in my book,

1218
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:48,793
do you understand?

1219
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:04,942
- Let me go.

1220
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:06,744
She needs me.

1221
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:07,768
Let me go.

1222
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:10,904
No.

1223
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:24,886
- There he is.

1224
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,857
Man too smart to
end up in cuffs.

1225
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:32,236
- How do you keep
it all together?

1226
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:33,260
Hm?

1227
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:37,741
Everything falling
apart in your life and

1228
01:25:37,765 --> 01:25:39,877
still you believe.

1229
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:41,846
- Don't think I don't get tired.

1230
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:44,882
Don't think I don't
ask for answers.

1231
01:25:44,906 --> 01:25:47,142
I do, but I keep the faith.

1232
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:49,711
- I'm a gambler.

1233
01:25:50,745 --> 01:25:51,745
I gamble.

1234
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:56,851
You don't know what it feels
like to grow up a gambler.

1235
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,421
You feel empty,

1236
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:02,489
unwanted.

1237
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:07,529
The only place I've...

1238
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:13,401
The only place I actually
felt like someone,

1239
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:17,114
was sitting at a table.

1240
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:19,350
- Well Michael, you know
there's one family that I know

1241
01:26:19,374 --> 01:26:22,810
that I'm always a part
of no matter what.

1242
01:26:26,091 --> 01:26:27,091
- No matter what.

1243
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:28,550
- No matter what.

1244
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:46,467
- I stand here, my hands and
feet shackled like a slave.

1245
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:50,905
My freedom is restricted.

1246
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:52,873
Freedom.

1247
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:57,445
Freedom is why we're here today.

1248
01:26:58,513 --> 01:27:01,725
The defendant has shackled
my client's freedom to share

1249
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:03,827
his faith with someone who

1250
01:27:03,851 --> 01:27:05,687
simply asked for help.

1251
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:10,668
And when my client responded
yes I'll help you,

1252
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:13,938
and decided to break
his shackles,

1253
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:15,196
they fired him.

1254
01:27:17,131 --> 01:27:18,199
They say that

1255
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:23,371
prayer in schools is
constitutional prohibited.

1256
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:27,851
I say it's constitutionally
protected.

1257
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:32,046
Freedom of speech protects
our right to speak freely,

1258
01:27:34,215 --> 01:27:37,695
and a plain text reading of
the amendment says no law,

1259
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:41,889
no law shall be made to impede
free exercise of religion.

1260
01:27:42,824 --> 01:27:46,503
So they say separation
of church and state,

1261
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:50,632
I say there would be no
state without the church.

1262
01:27:51,532 --> 01:27:54,378
But ladies and gentlemen,

1263
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:55,470
I'm helpless,

1264
01:27:56,938 --> 01:28:01,109
I've taken him as far as
my abilities have allowed.

1265
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:03,978
And now it's up to you.

1266
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:08,759
I'm helpless bound
in these shackles.

1267
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:12,120
I can't break them, I
can't unlock them.

1268
01:28:13,688 --> 01:28:16,190
I can't do anything on my own.

1269
01:28:55,763 --> 01:28:58,442
- Has the jury
reached a verdict?

1270
01:28:58,466 --> 01:29:00,234
- We have your Honor.

1271
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,144
We find

1272
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:18,386
for the plaintiff, Aiden Paul.

1273
01:29:21,556 --> 01:29:23,333
- And for damages?

1274
01:29:23,357 --> 01:29:27,295
- We award the plaintiff
$700,000 reinstatement

1275
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:32,743
with full pay and for the
defendant to pay attorney

1276
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:35,336
fees in the amount of $250,000.

1277
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,892
And the jury collectively

1278
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:51,795
wants to say that
as a community,

1279
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:54,264
we wish more teachers

1280
01:29:54,288 --> 01:29:57,334
would take the time to
pray with the students

1281
01:29:57,358 --> 01:29:59,169
in our schools.

1282
01:29:59,193 --> 01:30:02,172
- Defense moves for a
directive verdict your Honor.

1283
01:30:02,196 --> 01:30:03,607
- Denied.

1284
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:06,276
- Request to the state of
the order pending appealed.

1285
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:07,211
- Denied.

1286
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:08,479
Coach Paul,

1287
01:30:08,503 --> 01:30:10,714
you are ordered reinstated
as of immediately.

1288
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:12,516
Congratulations, counselor.

1289
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,184
But my order of
contempt still stands,

1290
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:16,520
you still have to show more
respect for the institution

1291
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:17,821
of the law,

1292
01:30:17,845 --> 01:30:21,492
now you may conclude your
celebration in custody.

1293
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:22,516
Bailiff.

1294
01:30:57,685 --> 01:30:59,096
- Five minutes older than me.

1295
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,531
- Stop it.

1296
01:31:00,555 --> 01:31:03,491
I am the baby and
I always will be.

1297
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:15,245
- Never understood, I always
wondered how a man could

1298
01:31:15,269 --> 01:31:18,506
survive in quarters
fit for a rat, huh?

1299
01:31:19,941 --> 01:31:23,120
Well, the reason for my visit.

1300
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:24,745
- You read my mind.

1301
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:28,149
- Thomas Hill.

1302
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:30,150
- Who?

1303
01:31:31,285 --> 01:31:34,264
- He sat unseen for nearly
30 years but a name who

1304
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:37,358
who still haunts me
to this very day.

1305
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:43,974
Third year, law school I was
an intern in the district

1306
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:47,544
attorney's office and I
tried my first case.

1307
01:31:47,568 --> 01:31:49,070
I was arrogant and

1308
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:52,039
he beat me down.

1309
01:31:53,608 --> 01:31:57,387
The walk of shame when I got
back to the office, whoa.

1310
01:31:57,411 --> 01:32:01,582
I promise I'd never allow
myself to get beat again.

1311
01:32:03,718 --> 01:32:05,362
When things got difficult,

1312
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:08,765
those two words,
they motivated me,

1313
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:09,790
Thomas Hill.

1314
01:32:13,094 --> 01:32:15,596
Now replaced by Michael Brown,

1315
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:19,042
the only man to have
ever beaten me,

1316
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:21,378
replaced by the only other
man to have ever beat me

1317
01:32:21,402 --> 01:32:23,914
who's name will drive
me to my twilight

1318
01:32:23,938 --> 01:32:26,340
to never feel this way again.

1319
01:32:28,676 --> 01:32:31,221
- Was that a long
winded congratulations?

1320
01:32:31,245 --> 01:32:34,749
- That's what it sounded
like to me, yeah.

1321
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,632
- Seeing that a jury's
ordered my client to pay

1322
01:32:41,656 --> 01:32:44,668
nearly one million dollars
combined with the fact that

1323
01:32:44,692 --> 01:32:48,639
we do not wish to upset the
Supreme Court's precedent's

1324
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:51,942
in the unlikely event that
you should win an appeal.

1325
01:32:51,966 --> 01:32:56,137
I have been authorized to
make you a one time offer.

1326
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:09,950
- $300,000.

1327
01:33:11,786 --> 01:33:15,122
- $200,000 Mr Paul,
$100,000 to counsel.

1328
01:33:19,126 --> 01:33:22,129
- This check is dated
four days ago.

1329
01:33:23,863 --> 01:33:25,943
- I had the authority to
issue it anytime I felt that

1330
01:33:25,967 --> 01:33:29,947
you actually had a chance
to make your case.

1331
01:33:29,971 --> 01:33:32,406
Which didn't arise until your

1332
01:33:33,541 --> 01:33:34,985
moving

1333
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:36,009
closing.

1334
01:33:44,919 --> 01:33:47,464
I don't want to stand
around here all day so,

1335
01:33:47,488 --> 01:33:49,056
what's it gonna be?

1336
01:33:51,002 --> 01:33:52,002
- My job?

1337
01:33:52,026 --> 01:33:53,928
- Court's order stands.

1338
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:06,874
I did ask the judge
for one little favor.

1339
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:13,693
- You can go ahead and
roll your things up,

1340
01:34:13,717 --> 01:34:16,887
I'll be back to get
you in 10 minutes.

1341
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:20,130
- Still don't think there's
anything greater going

1342
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:21,131
on in here Michael?

1343
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:22,332
- What are you doing?

1344
01:34:22,356 --> 01:34:24,334
- What does it look
like I'm doing, man.

1345
01:34:24,358 --> 01:34:25,602
- Here and now?

1346
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:27,528
- Don't you understand,

1347
01:34:28,429 --> 01:34:29,597
don't you see?
