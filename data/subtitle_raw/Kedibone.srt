1
00:00:07,416 --> 00:00:12,083
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

2
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:16,375
five, four, three, two, one…

3
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:20,166
Happy New Year!

4
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,875
I love you, baby!

5
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:14,875
Congratulations, baby! Huh?

6
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,375
- Going to varsity.
- Yes, that's me.

7
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:21,041
- When did you get the text?
- They've just sent it.

8
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,458
-Let's get out of here.

9
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:28,750
It might get worse
than it already is.

10
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,833
Guys, he's scared!

11
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,416
Happy!

12
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,375
Mmm-mm!

13
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,541
Mmm-mm!

14
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,041
Huh-uh! Please stop!

15
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,166
-Damn!

16
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,375
Wow! Varsity.

17
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,583
Aunt, I passed!

18
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,041
I got three distinctions!
Can you believe it?

19
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,125
Wow!

20
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,291
Finally, I can get rid
of that school uniform.

21
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,458
Oh! By the way, you need to send a
deposit along with my matric results.

22
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,458
My girl.

23
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,661
Isn't there a cheaper school

24
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,916
Not this again, Aunty.

25
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,958
I told you there is no better school
that offers a Degree in Acting.

26
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,541
Acting again?

27
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,666
But you said if I pass
you going to let me go.

28
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,541
Yes, because I thought you'd realise
that there's no money in acting.

29
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,750
Well, that's what I've chosen.

30
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,666
Then that means we
have to move to plan B.

31
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,184
But you've never told
me about plan B though.

32
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,476
That's because I didn't
think we'd needed it…

33
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,851
but the way you are carrying on
we will definitely need plan B.

34
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:46,791
You remember that stokvel,
Hope of Glory that fell apart?

35
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,875
Yes.

36
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:54,875
Well I took all your varsity
savings and invested it there.

37
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,083
I'm leaving.

38
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,666
Aunt, you took my tuition money
and invested it in Hope of Glory!

39
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,041
Who does that!

40
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,125
Kedibone!

41
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,541
I was hoping for a great
return on my investment

42
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,267
so I could give this house a facelift
and also pay for your tuition.

43
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,458
Okay, now how will I go to
university if there's no money?

44
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,333
Are you saying I should
stay at home the whole year?

45
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,625
Am I homebound doing nothing?

46
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,791
I've been working at
Checkers for 16 years.

47
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,041
I spoke with my manager

48
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,525
and he said I should bring your
CV and you can start working.

49
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,500
Me?

50
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,666
Work at Checkers?

51
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,791
If you start now, you'll have a huge
pension fund by the time you retire.

52
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,041
That's not going to happen.

53
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,500
I'm not going to
work at Checkers!

54
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,041
Kedibone!

55
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,666
Stop acting like a spoilt child.

56
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,125
You know the situation.

57
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,458
There is no money. It's gone!

58
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:51,958
My goodness! Huh-uh!

59
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Really!

60
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,291
Argh! Uh!

61
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,125
You know sometimes I
wish my mom was here.

62
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,083
Coz I wouldn't be going
through all of this.

63
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,125
Like… I just want
to study, baby.

64
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,392
I don't want to be a statistic,

65
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,434
I want to leave the township

66
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,125
and just further my studies.

67
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,791
-Baby.

68
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:17,875
Listen…

69
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,708
You will go to varsity. Okay?

70
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,500
-Hey?

71
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,291
You seem to forget that I
can make anything happen.

72
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,625
Look… I never want
to see you cry, baby.

73
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:28,750
Understand?

74
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:32,375
Just trust me and
all will be fine.

75
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,416
I need this student
loan, please!

76
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,291
- My sister.
- It's a bit too late, hey.

77
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,708
I can't help you.

78
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,583
I know, but I really
need your help…

79
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,066
- I can't afford to take a gap year.
- It's already too late.

80
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:02,666
<i>I'd kill to have a car
like this, bra. Eish!</i>

81
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,208
<i>- Cool!
- Cool!</i>

82
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,458
<i>There's no jitter
here, do you hear.</i>

83
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,875
<i>Because it's a German machine.</i>

84
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,083
<i>Your dad left you a
good inheritance, hey!</i>

85
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,625
<i>Convertible! Coupe. Woah!</i>

86
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,375
<i>I just wannt study, baby.</i>

87
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,458
<i>You will go to varsity. Okay?</i>

88
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,625
I am totally going to beat you.

89
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,333
There! Take that!

90
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,333
Hey, Mrembula.

91
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:26,875
What's up, buddy?

92
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,583
Hah! Take that!

93
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,166
Mrembula…

94
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,291
What's up, brother?

95
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,208
I sold my car.

96
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,958
I had to, man.

97
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,583
Kedibone…

98
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,375
varsity…

99
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,208
Mrembula, are you telling
me that you sold your car?

100
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,250
Because of a girl?

101
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,125
Huh?

102
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,791
Mrembula sold the car
that his father gave him?

103
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,583
The whole BMW 325i is gone.

104
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,333
How much did you sell it for?

105
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,333
- Twenty five.
- What!

106
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,666
Twenty five thousand?

107
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,916
Have you lost your mind?

108
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Huh!

109
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,958
You're telling me you sold your
whole inheritance for Kedibone…

110
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,125
for R25,000?

111
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,416
You know what that car is?

112
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,041
That's a classic.

113
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:27,375
You and Mrembula
are couple goals.

114
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,541
You're my role model.

115
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,333
Themba… sell his car?

116
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,976
- He would never do that for me.
- Bottom line, we're going to varsity.

117
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,666
Yes! First years. First years.

118
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,541
How much do you still need?

119
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,083
Ten thousand…

120
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,208
Okay, listen…

121
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,000
Mrembula said he'd
give me R25,000.

122
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,333
So, I will give you R5,0000
and we will both be short.

123
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,166
Kedi…

124
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,250
- Are you being for real?
- Yes.

125
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,208
Kedi!

126
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,458
Oh…! Kedi!

127
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,976
This is the car I was
telling you about.

128
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,625
We call it Rosary.

129
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,458
Rosary?

130
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,375
Yeah, you know that thing…

131
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,583
Mother Theresa?

132
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,958
Say a short prayer and
it'll get you to work.

133
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,750
You see?

134
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:17,958
Here's the key.

135
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,375
If you fix it…

136
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,708
you can drive it.

137
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,416
Are we good? Yeah. Thank you.

138
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,083
Sure!

139
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,458
Mrembula bro…

140
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,583
Look at this!

141
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:33,916
Hey! What's all this?

142
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,625
I'm tired of being friends with guys
who can't think with their heads.

143
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,166
Go to hell!

144
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,291
Can you fix this car or not?

145
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,184
Yeah, the starter just
needs a bit of attention.

146
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,416
Well then stop complaining.

147
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,875
Friends like you
are draining, bro!

148
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,166
From a BMW to this!

149
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,625
Just stop right here.

150
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,416
Right here.

151
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,375
Yoh, Babe! This
feels like a dream.

152
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,708
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

153
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,958
Don't worry about it.

154
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,208
As long as we're happy.

155
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,166
Calm and relaxed… I'm happy.

156
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,490
Yeah but baby, you didn't have
to sell your father's car.

157
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,750
Don't worry about it, baby.

158
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,083
We sold that car
for a good cause.

159
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,666
Look where you are now?

160
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,916
But baby… this one is so old.

161
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,083
-What?

162
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:41,041
Which car? This
one? This is Rosary.

163
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,791
Give me two months
with this car.

164
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,041
You'll see when I
pull up in here.

165
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,416
-I'll show them flames.

166
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,291
You will even get new friends.

167
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,000
-And besides…

168
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,500
I'm getting a Lamborghini
with your first paycheck.

169
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,958
- With my paycheck?
- Yes.

170
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,583
Thank you.

171
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,791
I love you.

172
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,458
-I'll call you.

173
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,166
Baby…

174
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,333
-You must drive safe.

175
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,500
Love you.

176
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:22,958
Babe!

177
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,666
Babe!

178
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:41,458
My sister relax.
Gents, let's help.

179
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,541
Don't worry. We got this.

180
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,041
-Let's go, king.

181
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,125
Ah!

182
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,916
Let's go.

183
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,541
Where did that lady say we are
supposed to leave the trays?

184
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,791
Um…

185
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,375
I think there where
it says 'Out'.

186
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,458
Right there.

187
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,041
By the conveyor belts?

188
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,666
Yoh, friend!

189
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,916
-It's like a dream.

190
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,625
-Yoh!

191
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,958
Why is it doing that?

192
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,416
Okay…

193
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,083
They go in there
to get washed? Yoh!

194
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,041
Mmm!

195
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,750
What's wrong?

196
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,083
<i>Eish</i>…

197
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,916
It's just that, like…

198
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:16,083
I'm happy being here but at
the same time, I'm pregnant.

199
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,250
I mean, I am going to show soon…

200
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,625
and we eat a lot…

201
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,583
You'll be fine, don't
even worry about it…

202
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,541
Oh, don't stress about it.

203
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,875
Are you still my best friend?

204
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,000
Of course. Best friend.

205
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,875
That's my best friend.

206
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,875
Cute… Who are you?

207
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,309
Look at her hair,
that poofy thing.

208
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,541
Who did that?

209
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,208
It's Neo from Zone
6 in Diepkloof.

210
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,083
So, are you telling me
that's your actual hair?

211
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,208
- No…
- Yeah.

212
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,958
They crotched her and added
extensions plus a wig.

213
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,333
Okay, wait, guys.

214
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,666
Are you telling me that total nobodies
just joined this conversation?

215
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,809
How is this any
of your business?

216
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,666
You don't know me,
right? You don't know me?

217
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,083
You… tell me… where you from?

218
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,916
I'm from Soweto.

219
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,791
How are you this pretty
and you come from there?

220
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,291
Yes?

221
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,500
Right? Because there are no
beautiful girls in Soweto?

222
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,083
Hold on, guys!

223
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,601
Is someone gonna shut this bitch
up because she's been talkin...

224
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,875
Okay!

225
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,291
Jeez, guys.

226
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,291
So, are you First years?

227
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,583
Yeah… and you?

228
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,666
Do we look like
First years, doll?

229
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,625
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,541
Be careful of the
Fuck boys on campus,

231
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,125
they're a little tricky.

232
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,166
I like you.

233
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,583
We'll see you around.

234
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,583
Bye.

235
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,559
Why are you defending them?
They're not your friends.

236
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,023
Yes, but you don't
know them either.

237
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,083
Did you come with them?
You also don't know them.

238
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:54,666
Let's go.

239
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,375
Let's go!

240
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,500
When I try to start
the car… nothing.

241
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,458
So I ask Kedibone to
help so I can kick start.

242
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,500
Just before she starts to push…

243
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,083
some guys came to the rescue.

244
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,375
Come on, bro!

245
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,250
Doesn't she use this
car as her Uber?

246
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,458
So if you have to kick
start, she must push.

247
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,333
- Huh-uh. Push?
- Yeah.

248
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,500
No man, c'mon.

249
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,041
Mrembula there's one thing I
don't understand about you.

250
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,333
How can you…

251
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:27,791
give up your whole inheritance for
a girl you haven't even slept with?

252
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,041
Not once. Not even once!

253
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,916
Msithi, don't talk shit.

254
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,833
You know very well I'm
waiting for her to turn 21…

255
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,541
then I can deflower her!

256
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,791
Why do you act like you
don't know what the deal is?

257
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,083
When she turns 21? Yeah.

258
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,458
What if you die before then?

259
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,541
Should I…

260
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,083
deflower her for you?

261
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,708
-Three thousand… per month.

262
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,875
- So expensive.
- R1,500 a month?

263
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,601
- Where are we going to get this money?
- Buy airtime. We need to call them.

264
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:03,750
To go and see them
requires taxi money and…

265
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,916
Hello…

266
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,041
- Hello.
- Hi.

267
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,925
I overheard you are
looking for accommodation.

268
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,375
Hi.

269
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,333
Are you a student?

270
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,416
No, I used to be.

271
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,625
But now, I am an
acting lecturer.

272
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,500
Oh, Acting? Me too.

273
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,208
- I am a First Year student.
- Seriously?

274
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,750
- Yeah.
- Okay.

275
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,250
A young Thespian. Huh?

276
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,250
Lesbian?

277
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,041
- No. Thespian.
- Thespian!

278
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,333
I can already see you transforming
into the different characters…

279
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,041
and bringing light and shade
and dynamics to the roles.

280
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,791
-You go Thespian!

281
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,666
Yeah. That's fantastic!

282
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,166
So, where do you stay?

283
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,875
Um… for now we stay at home.

284
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,916
Yeah. We don't have enough
money to pay for res.

285
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,583
Oh…and these ones are expensive.

286
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,208
These are all just exploitation
of the African child.

287
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,333
Huh?

288
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,666
My friend owns the
Bannister Hotel.

289
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,916
Next to it, there's
free accommodation.

290
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,166
Free?

291
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,333
It's like a backpackers.

292
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,333
- What is a backpackers?
- Backpackers?

293
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,208
I can show you if you want.

294
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,625
Yes.

295
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:22,916
Here it is, ladies.

296
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,208
Come in.

297
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,875
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

298
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,000
No man!

299
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,458
Why aren't there any windows?

300
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:42,208
You know living in
the city is expensive.

301
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,166
Okay look, if someone moves out,
you will get one of the other rooms.

302
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,250
Woah!

303
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,708
And who's underwear is this?

304
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,833
Ah… these underpants?

305
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,666
Let me move them.

306
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,500
Um… Yeah.

307
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,500
- I can help you get settled...
- No, thanks.

308
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,125
Please give us a moment…

309
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,458
to… um, to…

310
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,291
to discuss this.

311
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,458
Oh, you want…

312
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,125
-some privacy? Okay.

313
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,208
Okay…

314
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,833
I'll see you around then.

315
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,166
-Ah!

316
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,750
Woah!

317
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,791
Friend, you're so extra.

318
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:00,291
It's my birthday week.
What do you want from me?

319
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,250
Ah, I'm gonna get so drunk.

320
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,291
Anyways, let's toast
to being fabulous.

321
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,875
No! Toast to me…

322
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,767
This is about me. Why the fuck
would we toast to anything else?

323
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,208
- Okay, okay, we'll have it your way.
- Yeah!

324
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,375
And I'm not going to serve them

325
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:19,041
because they think they are
better than anyone from Soweto.

326
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,458
Ha! Why are you
being so negative?

327
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,250
I'm sure they tip well
with all that money.

328
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,708
Their table is yours then.

329
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,166
-And we'll share
whatever they tip you.

330
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,875
-Babes, it's my dad.

331
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,791
- He's on his way.
- Okay.

332
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,041
Hi Franco.

333
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,333
Let me help.

334
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,375
-You're going to be fine.

335
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,541
Hey!

336
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,833
- Hey.
- How's it going?

337
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,791
- How are you?
- Sharp. Where's my daughter?

338
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,666
Um… she just quickly
rushed to the bathroom.

339
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,958
She's not feeling well.

340
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,458
You drink girls drink a lot.

341
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,541
- Daddy.
- Hi, baby.

342
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,416
My little dolphin.

343
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,125
Ah, dolphin.

344
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,500
Are you okay?

345
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,708
I don't feel well.

346
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,250
Here, have some water.

347
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,708
Yeah, drink.

348
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,541
Daddy, I want you to
meet my new friend.

349
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:19,833
She saved me!

350
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,017
Oh, it's the girl
with the pretty hair.

351
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,250
I think you need to
go home now, dolphin.

352
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,083
Amanda, please come and
take her to the car.

353
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:30,375
Make sure Njabulo takes
you home, he's in the car.

354
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,916
Take her bag and everything.

355
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,500
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

356
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,625
You must stop drinking
too much, baby girl.

357
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,666
You're so funny.

358
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,208
- Let me get the bi...
- I have to…

359
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,083
I really want to thank you
for saving my little dolphin.

360
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,166
Argh, it's not a problem.

361
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,890
She just wasn't feeling
well. That's all.

362
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,263
Has anyone ever told
how beautiful you are?

363
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,125
No…

364
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,750
But thank you… Sir.

365
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,166
Huh-uh. Call me Franco.

366
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,625
Sorry.

367
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,208
Ah! You don't have to be sorry.

368
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,458
The person who has to be sorry is
the one who made this gorgeous…

369
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:03,541
beautiful, stunning paragon
of human perfection.

370
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,583
Huh? Clean after drunks.

371
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,208
No, no, no. I need his address.

372
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:10,250
I want to find where he stays.
I want to know his parents.

373
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:15,166
- I will deal with him. Huh?
- You're so funny.

374
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,125
- What is your name?
- Uh… Kedibone.

375
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,083
Can I call you crayfish?

376
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,666
Uh… okay…

377
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,333
Let me get the bill.

378
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,416
Crayfish…

379
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,041
-I owe you one.

380
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,833
Three, two, one. Tada!

381
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,291
Daddy, you got me a car!

382
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,750
-Mmm?

383
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:49,250
Crayfish, come. Come
celebrate with your friend.

384
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,000
We'll catch up at lunch, okay?

385
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:53,958
Great.

386
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,958
I got a car!

387
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,708
- How about we ditch school?
- Yes!

388
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:04,458
- And we go shopping.
- Yeess!

389
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,375
But I have class soon.

390
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:10,916
Dude, dude, it's Monday. Everyone
in there is hung over. Let's go!

391
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,375
Okay, but I'm broke.

392
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,083
Don't worry. It's
on me. Come on!

393
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,625
It's my treat. Let's go.
I'll pay for everything.

394
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:23,250
- Dolphin's got a car!
- I've got a car!

395
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:24,875
Let's go, baby.
Let's go, Crayfish.

396
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,625
-Friend, come!

397
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,291
Uh-uh… you stay.

398
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:31,041
Go to school. School is cool.

399
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,166
Beautiful girls.

400
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,208
Okay, so let's get back to this.

401
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:59,250
When you say virgin…

402
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,791
you mean like virgin?

403
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,208
Virgin, virgin?

404
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:03,333
Yeah…

405
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:05,041
Like never used
a tampon, virgin.

406
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,458
Girl, do you know what
your vagina looks like?

407
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,583
Yeah.

408
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:12,166
Does your man know what
your vagina looks like?

409
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,666
Yeah, but…

410
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:18,916
I am waiting until I turn 21.

411
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,916
That's cute.

412
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,583
Let me tell you
about my first time.

413
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,500
It was super romantic.

414
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,458
There were flowers, champagne.

415
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:30,625
His parents are super
rich, obviously so…

416
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,750
He booked us out
this hotel room.

417
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,583
The sex itself was terrible.

418
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,458
But the experience
was just wonderful.

419
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:37,750
Okay and…

420
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,375
What does sex feel like?

421
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:40,875
Sex is amazing!

422
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,458
Sex is like…

423
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,750
it's like God floating down
from the heavens on a cloud

424
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:48,708
and whispering sweet
sensations into your ear.

425
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:50,958
But most guys…

426
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:53,083
Most guys don't know how
to make you come so, girl,

427
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:57,625
you gotta get on that dick and
grind and you grind and you grind!

428
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:59,541
I swear, it'll be amazing.

429
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,708
<i>Eish</i>! That sounds…

430
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:03,916
Sounds… rough.

431
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:05,833
You know what.

432
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:07,083
My first time…

433
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,916
I know Mrembula is
a very gentle guy.

434
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,625
- Hmm-mm.
- So he's gonna…

435
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,208
kiss me.

436
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,583
And he's gonna
unbutton my shirt.

437
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,041
Uh-huh!

438
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,625
And he's gonna
suck on my titties.

439
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:21,000
Geez, you've got this thing down
to like, every clothing item.

440
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:23,291
And then he is gonna…

441
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,611
Put his penis
inside your vagina.

442
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,625
I'm tired of swimming.

443
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,250
I need to go home now.

444
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:52,642
Thank you so much
for everything.

445
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,083
I will take you home.

446
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:55,250
If you don't mind.

447
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:57,500
Okay.

448
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:58,625
Thank you.

449
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:00,708
Let's go. You'll
be safe. Trust me.

450
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:39,166
Ah… Crayfish.

451
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:40,958
So…

452
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:42,041
this is it?

453
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:43,125
Yeah.

454
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:44,708
It's way smaller
than your mansion.

455
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:46,791
You don't have to
be embarrassed.

456
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,250
You have a roof over your head.

457
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,416
Yes, but one day…

458
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,767
You know, I'm gonna buy myself
a life away from this place.

459
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:54,708
And you know what that day could
be much sooner than you think.

460
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:57,333
- What do you mean?
- I want us to be special friends

461
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:58,791
and have a special friendship.

462
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:01,958
Franco…

463
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,708
What exactly do you want?

464
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,500
You know what, close your eyes.

465
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,541
Close your eyes.

466
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,708
Just wait!

467
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:12,250
Patience. Patience. Patience.

468
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:16,583
Don't open your eyes yet.

469
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,250
And now, open…

470
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,291
What's this?

471
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,458
Possibilities.

472
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,541
Here…

473
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:38,583
It's yours. Take it.

474
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,416
- Uh, Franco, no I… I can't.
- No, no, no.

475
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,875
You can't be rude.
Don't be rude.

476
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:46,541
It's a gift. It's yours.

477
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:53,833
Ahh…

478
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:58,750
Yeah…

479
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,916
Spend it however you like.

480
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,875
Do your hair, your
nails, the works…

481
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,541
Have fun with it.

482
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:08,333
Okay?

483
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:10,833
Later.

484
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,458
Jesus Christ!

485
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,458
Woah!

486
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:33,541
Beauty.

487
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:45,416
What is this?

488
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,541
It's a phone.

489
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,458
Yeah but…

490
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,541
I've got a phone.

491
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:51,791
Yeah, I bought it for you.

492
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,416
I already have a phone
and it works fine.

493
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,916
Huh-uh! This one
is also yours. Huh?

494
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,166
One more thing…

495
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,791
I won a cellphone.

496
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:10,041
You gotta be kidding me!

497
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:14,458
You won a cellphone,
just like that?

498
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:15,750
No way!

499
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:18,041
- Congrats, baby.
- Thank you, baby.

500
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,583
Actually, I want you to have it.

501
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:22,875
There we go, there we go!

502
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,416
Beauty.

503
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,041
Go for it, go for it, go for it!

504
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,958
Ah, this palette is so amazing!

505
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,541
I should have
gotten one as well.

506
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,745
And these colours are gonna
look so good on your skin.

507
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,833
Fuck it, you are beautiful!

508
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:38,392
Like I forget and then I
look at you, I'm just like,

509
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:39,666
"Oh my God, you're beautiful."

510
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,083
And can I tell you something?

511
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,000
Rich people love beautiful shit.

512
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,833
Beautiful cars,
beautiful houses.

513
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:47,916
Beautiful fish. Great.

514
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:49,750
Fantastic.

515
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,166
I swear to God, Kedi…

516
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,750
with that face…

517
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,708
You'll have the rich
falling over you.

518
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,541
Opening every door for you.

519
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:00,000
Will snatch that face…

520
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,291
get you a good weave.

521
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,375
Don't do that. That
doesn't look classy.

522
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:05,500
Afterall…

523
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,083
I want to get you a rich man.

524
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,083
Take you out of poverty.

525
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,041
Woah!

526
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:35,000
Comrades are really funny, hey.

527
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,875
Seriously man, I'm telling you.

528
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:38,541
If the tender is
for R200 million…

529
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,250
and Mbaks wants R50 million…

530
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,708
give it to him.

531
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:44,916
Just give it to him.

532
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,800
How else are you going
to get the next tender.

533
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:49,791
Hey, cheers guys!

534
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,541
-Cheers!

535
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:54,750
- All the best.
- Oh, politicians are very funny.

536
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:56,833
Oh, they are very funny.

537
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:03,583
- Hello, Bra D.
- Hello.

538
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:05,500
Quick word with you?

539
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:07,458
Sure. What's wrong?

540
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,250
Uh…

541
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,541
Bra D, I wanted to know if…

542
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,125
anyone has off days

543
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:16,375
so I could work
during that period?

544
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:17,916
You want to work overtime again?

545
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:20,125
Yeah, I need it Bra D.

546
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:22,541
Your dad used to
say the same thing.

547
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:24,458
"I really need this overtime."

548
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:26,226
And when I warned him
about overworking himself…

549
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,375
He said one day, he
would buy this place.

550
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:29,375
Is that why?

551
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,375
Ah… No. Bra D.

552
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:33,291
Bra D, I'm saving up for lobola.

553
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:35,041
Huh?

554
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:37,875
You want to get married?

555
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:39,083
Yes, I do.

556
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:40,958
Oh my boy…

557
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:42,791
That's a beautiful thing.

558
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:44,833
You can work the extra hours.

559
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,416
Just make sure you
don't break your back.

560
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,458
Remember, after the wedding,

561
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:51,833
you still need to
consummate the marriage.

562
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,226
- I hear you Bra D.
- You know what I'm talking about?

563
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,583
Bra D…

564
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:59,000
- Thank you Bra D.
- Do you have the experience?

565
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:10,458
I need to go and
fetch this car part

566
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:12,000
that Msithi's been
nagging me about.

567
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,375
Okay.

568
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,791
Thank you.

569
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:17,541
-So…

570
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:22,333
I swear to God, I
am gonna tag you.

571
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:24,351
Two thousand likes by the
end of the day, darling.

572
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:25,291
I promise!

573
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:26,666
Okay? Average.

574
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,708
Hey, Kedi…

575
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,458
Is that not your friend?

576
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:34,458
-Can you see your likes?

577
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:36,750
Come… see your likes.

578
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:40,958
That is a beautiful
picture. It's pretty.

579
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:44,333
So… who has to come up
first and show us something?

580
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,416
Kedibone.

581
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,420
Why don't you come up?
Let's show them something.

582
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:55,458
So we sit down.

583
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,791
We lock our toes.

584
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:01,000
And we lock our hands.

585
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,500
And we lock our eyes.

586
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:10,833
And on my count…

587
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,375
One…

588
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:13,833
Two…

589
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:14,916
Three…

590
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:20,875
Let me not into the
marriage of true minds.

591
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,958
Admit impediments.

592
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:27,041
We tried our best but
you're not forgiving us.

593
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:29,625
Love does not insist
in its own way.

594
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:31,375
Your name is Martha

595
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,892
and you will work in that factory
for a duration of six months.

596
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,833
After which you will
pack all your belongings

597
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:38,583
and go back to those very
valleys and mountains,

598
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:41,541
where you will be greeted
by smiles and giggles.

599
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:45,416
From the children you've
left for a whole six months.

600
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:49,958
And they will be
expecting gifts from…

601
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,625
from that Johannesburg.

602
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:56,583
But as you step
onto your doorstep…

603
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:01,666
you realise that all those gifts
that were promised by Johannesburg…

604
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,666
were intangible.

605
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,833
That's it. That's
it Kedi. Well done!

606
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:22,625
Nice one.

607
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:25,291
Rise of the African child.

608
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,041
Good. Okay, I'll see
you guys next week.

609
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,875
- Alright, have a good one.
- Bye, Sir.

610
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:31,166
Kedibone…

611
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,583
May I have a word with you.

612
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,291
I was wondering if…

613
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:38,875
-I can meet you in
the dressing room…

614
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:41,083
Once you've gotten your things.

615
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:43,583
Just something that I
wanna talk to you about.

616
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:45,041
Okay… um…

617
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,267
-Dressing room…
I'll see you there.

618
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:47,375
Okay. It's this side.

619
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,708
Hi, Franco…

620
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,875
Yeah. I know, I know.

621
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,458
Can I just call you later?

622
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:03,958
Bye.

623
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,000
Rise of the African Child.

624
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:14,291
It's a big play, you know.

625
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,166
It's important to us Africans.

626
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,875
And Kedibone…

627
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,500
you're perfect for this role.

628
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:24,291
It's as if it was
written for you.

629
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:26,916
You'll see.

630
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,458
It's going to be wonderful.

631
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,416
You're perfect.

632
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:35,416
Just perfect.

633
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,375
So, aren't we talking anymore?

634
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:13,958
- Friend…
- No!

635
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:16,875
Don't "friend" me. I
can't get hold of you.

636
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:20,958
When I call, you don't answer
'cause you're busy with Franco…

637
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,666
Wait, let me get my phone.

638
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,708
I'm good, right?

639
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:57,291
I'm good.

640
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,375
I'm good.

641
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,083
I think need the gym.

642
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,833
I must get a personal trainer.

643
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,541
And you could be the one.

644
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:07,875
-Me? -Yes.

645
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,541
- I wish. Yoh!
- I'm telling you.

646
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:11,583
I'll pay you.

647
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,208
Look at that.

648
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,041
Huh?

649
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,666
Yes…

650
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,875
There we go.

651
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:28,958
Thank you.

652
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:31,083
No, thank you.

653
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:33,750
-For being a good friend.

654
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:38,666
It's okay.

655
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:41,416
I'll wait.

656
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,333
I'm a patient man.

657
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:45,083
Huh?

658
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:47,166
Take care.

659
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,250
Yeah.

660
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:50,291
-Okay.

661
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,125
The old man is exhausted!

662
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:54,625
-I need to go now.

663
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,291
- Look after yourself okay.
- Okay.

664
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,000
Have fun.

665
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:00,708
Enjoy it.

666
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:02,833
-Thank you.

667
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:08,166
Alright…

668
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:10,041
What's up, Crayfish!

669
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:13,250
Woah!

670
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,833
Hey, hey, hey!

671
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:17,416
Yoh!

672
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:20,458
We're celebrating,
because I found an agency.

673
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:22,500
- Mmm-hm.
- Agency?

674
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:23,916
Mmm-hm, acting agency.

675
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:25,833
Oh okay, so…

676
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:28,166
Those people who send you…

677
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,725
- To television stations?
- To auditions.

678
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,184
- Yeah…
- And then they're are going to tell you

679
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:33,875
if you got the gig.
Those type of things.

680
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:36,083
-Okay. Okay.

681
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,375
Got you.

682
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:45,625
Babe.

683
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:46,916
The necklace?

684
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,166
Is that real?

685
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,875
No, baby, I got from China Town.

686
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:52,541
It's so cheap.

687
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:54,666
It cost about R20.

688
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,916
Yoh, no. It looks like…

689
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,583
Like the real thing.

690
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:00,434
They really know how to make
these things these days.

691
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:02,625
Ah, you know how
the Chinese are.

692
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:04,750
-I know them.

693
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,583
Don't worry we'll be alright.

694
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:08,583
Soon we'll be able to
afford to eat crayfish.

695
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,708
Hey? As well as…

696
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:13,041
Lobster, huh?

697
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,625
The high life things.

698
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,875
<i>Fuck it, you're beautiful!</i>

699
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:47,083
<i>And can I tell you something,</i>

700
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:49,375
<i>rich people love beautiful shit!</i>

701
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:53,916
<i>After all, I want to
get you a rich man.</i>

702
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:56,208
<i>Take you out of
poverty, you know.</i>

703
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:10,916
- Good day.
- Hi.

704
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,375
Take a seat.

705
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,083
How can I help you?

706
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:21,500
Ma, I actually came to…

707
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:25,750
I want Kedibone's
hand in marriage.

708
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,833
I… I want to make her my wife.

709
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:31,625
Hah! That will never happen.

710
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,583
This child!

711
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,250
No, that can't happen.

712
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:39,208
- Why not?
- No ways.

713
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:41,000
Please hear me out.

714
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:42,666
Kedibone…

715
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,041
I love Kedibone.

716
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:45,833
Are you ready for marriage?

717
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:49,083
Or you think marriage is a joke.

718
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:51,541
- I am ready.
- Okay, forget that.

719
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:53,250
I'll pretend that I'm Kedibone.

720
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:56,666
Propose to me so I can see if
you're as ready as you claim to be.

721
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:58,458
Mmm!

722
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,250
Okay… um…

723
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:03,625
Uh…

724
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:05,416
Put the ring on my finger!

725
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:08,958
Kedi…Kedibone.

726
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:12,375
K… K… Kedibone Ma… Manamela.

727
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:21,833
Are you just going to
keep calling her name?

728
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:24,458
And not state your intention?

729
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:26,208
If you're going to
propose to Kedibone,

730
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:28,291
you need to be confident.

731
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:30,708
And not stutter,
Kedibone, Kedibone!

732
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:33,541
I will allow you
to marry Kedibone

733
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:37,875
but don't do what you
just did ever again.

734
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:40,708
This won't work.
Go and practise!

735
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:45,625
Use a mirror and make sure you know
what to say when you talk to Kedibone.

736
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:46,916
Go, go, go!

737
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,416
It's a surprise.

738
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,958
Wait a minute, wait a bit.

739
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:52,583
Stand right here.

740
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:55,375
- Okay, now I'm nervous.
- Okay. Ready?

741
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:57,583
-Ah!

742
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,291
This is yours.

743
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:02,416
Fully paid and all.

744
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,541
Welcome home, Crayfish.

745
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:09,750
What!

746
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:20,833
This is so…

747
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,750
Look at my view!

748
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:31,583
No frickin ways!

749
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:34,250
Phew!

750
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,375
Hmm.

751
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:06,416
Do you want a taste
of this crayfish?

752
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:09,541
Yes, Crayfish.

753
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:11,458
Yes.

754
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:35,041
-Ah! -

755
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:41,416
- Isn't there a lift?
- We're already here my guy.

756
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:44,583
We're going to get fit here.

757
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:46,458
I am already fit.

758
00:44:46,541 --> 00:44:47,916
I was born fit.

759
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,958
So, baby, what do you think?

760
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:52,458
-Ah!

761
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:54,666
-Yeah! You did well.

762
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,875
-Ah! The view!

763
00:44:57,958 --> 00:44:59,458
Look at the Jozi skyline.

764
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:01,250
-Ah, wow!

765
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:02,541
So, tell me…

766
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:04,541
the agent put all
of this together?

767
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:06,583
Yes, baby. All of it.

768
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:11,666
Marble floors, marble
kitchen, everything.

769
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,500
- Just for you?
- No, baby, with Tanya.

770
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:16,666
This other girl from
school. She is so cool.

771
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:22,833
I also want this
for myself one day.

772
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:24,583
Wow! Yeah!

773
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:26,875
Tony Montana views.

774
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:28,333
The world is mine!

775
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,291
I'm telling you.

776
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:41,500
I'm telling you. Hey, hey!

777
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:42,958
Are you jealous now, Msithi.

778
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,625
We're here on the
December 16 holiday.

779
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:49,166
And I can't wait for us to make
great memories, right here.

780
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,291
- Right here?
- Mmm…

781
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:53,375
- Like… now?
- Mmm-hm.

782
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:55,541
Msithi…

783
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:57,958
Go kick start the car,
we're leaving soon.

784
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,916
- I have to go.
- Okay.

785
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,708
Bye, baby.

786
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:15,583
I'm telling you Msithi
the first three weeks…

787
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:17,916
I couldn't sleep…

788
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,750
Thinking about how these rich
boys might try and get with Kedi.

789
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:26,625
Yoh!

790
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:29,416
At least she got a
decent place now.

791
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,500
The one she used to
live in was trash.

792
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:34,791
Yeah, yeah. I agree.

793
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:38,250
She's in heaven now
compared to where she was.

794
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:41,541
Tell me something. Is she
only staying with her friend?

795
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:44,125
Of course.

796
00:46:44,208 --> 00:46:46,666
And the agent is paying rent?

797
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,333
Yeah, that sounds
just about right.

798
00:46:49,416 --> 00:46:51,458
Have you met this agent?

799
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:54,041
What business do I
have with the agent?

800
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:57,541
Have you met him? Do
you even know his name?

801
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:59,708
- Who are you talking about?
- The agent.

802
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:01,375
Msithi, how am I
supposed to know?

803
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:05,250
What's with all these questions?
You should've asked Kedibone!

804
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:07,750
I don't know anything about
agents and how these things work.

805
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,708
Okay, then. Don't
get so emotional.

806
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:11,625
Delivery for Kedibone.

807
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:15,541
Kedibone?

808
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,583
That's me.

809
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:23,125
Rise of the African Child.

810
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:27,208
You know, Dineo…
This is a big play.

811
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:29,458
And you are just the right
person for this role.

812
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:36,833
You and only you are
perfect for this role.

813
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:39,000
It's as if they wrote
this play for you.

814
00:47:58,708 --> 00:47:59,791
Yes?

815
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,875
I thought you said
you'd call me.

816
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:06,166
Look, my plate is kinda
full right now, so… yeah.

817
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,875
But do you know what, I really
need this class in order to pass.

818
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:12,041
I don't know, Kedibone.

819
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:22,041
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

820
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:43,625
I saw on Instagram you are
looking for actors and models.

821
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:45,291
Well, I'm studying
to be an actress.

822
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:46,500
Oh, okay.

823
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:48,083
Uh… tell me…

824
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:49,958
What kind of acting do you do.

825
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:53,083
Well, I am acting on a
stage play at school.

826
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:54,326
And they gave me a lead role…

827
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:56,625
w… which I lost but I'm
gonna get it back soon.

828
00:48:56,708 --> 00:48:59,388
Tell me, what are you busy with
next weekend. Are you are available?

829
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,041
I'm definitely free!

830
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:02,625
- Hello.
- Hello, Sir.

831
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:05,083
Uh… I would like to make
a withdrawal, please.

832
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:06,708
Okay please insert
your card there.

833
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:11,583
Please enter your pin.

834
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:16,125
Okay, so… how much
do you want to draw?

835
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:19,708
All of it.

836
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,041
Are you sure?

837
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:22,750
Yes.

838
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:24,500
Please hurry up, my sister.

839
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:27,000
So, where do I get the script?

840
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,458
Don't worry where you are going.

841
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:30,181
They will have a script
for you my angel.

842
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,041
And how much do you pay?

843
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:33,541
Let me tell you.

844
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:34,625
Eighty thousand rand.

845
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:35,833
For starters!

846
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:37,250
Eight… Eighty thousand…

847
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:38,916
My girl, I'm telling you.

848
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,791
Plenty more where
that came from.

849
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:43,541
Okay, this is all of it.

850
00:49:43,625 --> 00:49:46,416
Twenty thousand…
as you requested.

851
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:00,541
Am I gonna get my
lead role back?

852
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,500
Yes.

853
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,541
-Ah! -How are you?

854
00:50:50,625 --> 00:50:55,125
I called you here because I want to know
who you've invited for the ceremony.

855
00:50:55,208 --> 00:50:57,250
I've already spoken
to Gheminah about it.

856
00:50:57,333 --> 00:51:00,500
She said she'll invite
the friends from varsity.

857
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:02,416
Okay, but don't forget
about the cousins.

858
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,916
And the rest of the family.

859
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,541
This is a big deal.

860
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:07,000
I won't forget about them.

861
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:09,166
It's just that I wanted
to lay low because

862
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,041
you know, it's a surprise.

863
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:13,166
I'm aware that it's a surprise.

864
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,000
I know how to keep a secret.

865
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:18,875
What I want to know is do you have
the funds to make this possible?

866
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:21,125
Financially I'm sorted.

867
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:25,000
I even got overtime
pay from work.

868
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:28,500
She's also found an agent. Everything
is going according to plan.

869
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:30,375
Hey! Wow!

870
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:32,541
Thank God for that agent.

871
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:34,583
He's a gift from above.

872
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:41,208
Oh, now I'm convinced
that this acting thing…

873
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:44,083
You know… it's working for her.

874
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:48,291
I'm also going to see if we can
extend an invitation to the agent.

875
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,666
You see, now you're talking.

876
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:55,458
The agent needs to bear
witness to everything.

877
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,791
- You know what I'm saying.
- I hear you loud and clear.

878
00:51:57,875 --> 00:51:59,125
Okay then…

879
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:02,375
I'm preparing dinner now
and you're not invited.

880
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:03,833
Please…

881
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:07,208
Okay Ma'am, on another note…

882
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:11,416
I think you have
a hidden talent.

883
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,333
Could you hit me
with one more note…

884
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:15,250
- before I leave.
- Hey!

885
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:21,708
Okay girl, outside.

886
00:52:21,791 --> 00:52:23,375
Make sure you get the job done.

887
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:25,541
He can have you, okay?

888
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:28,541
Uh, uh, uh!

889
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:30,500
What's this?

890
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:33,517
How are you going
to work like this?

891
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:34,666
Go get changed.

892
00:52:35,791 --> 00:52:37,708
Hurry up and start drinking.

893
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:42,708
Ooh, I can't deal
with ghetto girls.

894
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:56,541
You okay?

895
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:04,458
- I think she wants some.
- She should. Definitely.

896
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:11,333
It'll make you feel
so good. Trust me.

897
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:13,666
Have just a little. I cut
a little line just for you.

898
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:17,708
It's a nice small one…

899
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:24,333
It's good, hey?

900
00:53:24,416 --> 00:53:26,333
-Did you inhale?

901
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:30,583
It's good, hey?

902
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,208
I feel like I'm
getting a nose bleed

903
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:36,125
Fuck!

904
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:56,250
Don't forget that you're paying.

905
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,833
Yes. Yes.

906
00:53:58,416 --> 00:53:59,500
You see…

907
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,791
-Hi… -Who's this?

908
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,541
- Karabo.
- Oh, Kedibone.

909
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:58,625
Yeah, where are you? I'm
still at your house and…

910
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:00,166
I need my money.

911
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:02,476
Listen, I'm at the airport now
getting ready to go to Cape Town so…

912
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,642
You said you'd give me R 80,000.
When are you going to give it to me?

913
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:06,416
Let me send you…

914
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,250
- You wanted your R500.
- Five hundred ra…

915
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:12,833
- What!
- Please don't stress me.

916
00:55:12,916 --> 00:55:14,875
I'm tired and I'm late
for my flight, bye.

917
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:16,208
No, but you…

918
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,333
More lemon, please.

919
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,625
Thank you.

920
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:51,500
Kedibone.

921
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,500
- How are you?
- Hi, Sir.

922
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:56,708
Don't call me sir.
We're not at school.

923
00:55:57,458 --> 00:55:59,291
Let's dance.

924
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:03,208
No, I can't dance because
these heels are killing me.

925
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:04,750
I'm not used to them.

926
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:05,833
Oh!

927
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:10,708
Can I join you?

928
00:56:10,791 --> 00:56:13,541
Do you need some company?

929
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:17,875
I'm actually waiting for my friends
they just went to the bathroom.

930
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,583
They'll be back for their seats.

931
00:56:19,666 --> 00:56:22,166
I'll see you around then.

932
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,125
Shots?

933
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:39,583
I don't do tequila shots.

934
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:43,666
Look around, it's a
nominations after-party.

935
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:45,333
Loosen up a bit.

936
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:48,166
Yes, but do you see
that old man over there?

937
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:51,541
- That old man?
- Yes.

938
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:52,916
Tequila did that to him.

939
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,333
He's an old man.

940
00:56:54,416 --> 00:56:56,000
You can't compare the two.

941
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,166
Come on.

942
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,500
Okay fine.

943
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:04,625
Yeah!

944
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:10,708
Ah ha…

945
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:13,208
You know what, actual…
here's another one.

946
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:14,375
To your nomination.

947
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,541
So, you do know who I am?

948
00:57:19,583 --> 00:57:22,916
Smash, the whole country
knows who you are.

949
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:26,166
- [Smash laughing]

950
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,333
You know how to do
your thing. Yoh!

951
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:29,708
What is your name, buy the way?

952
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:32,250
I'm Kedibone.

953
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:33,625
Kedibone?

954
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:35,666
- Yeah.
- Oh.

955
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:36,892
I haven't seen you around, um…

956
00:57:36,916 --> 00:57:38,500
are you… new to the
acting industry?

957
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:42,166
Yeah, I'm studying
acting actually.

958
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:44,166
- Really?
- Yeah.

959
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:48,250
I mean I am chilling with
actors, colleagues, producers.

960
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:52,958
How are you gonna get to know anyone in
the industry if you're chilling here?

961
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:54,083
Okay…

962
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:56,041
Give me your things.

963
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:07,833
Friend, call me back.

964
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:09,166
I think…

965
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,500
I think something is wrong.

966
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:14,000
I think I am having
contractions.

967
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:15,666
Okay…

968
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:22,541
Yoh!

969
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,958
Should we leave this joint?

970
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:27,916
Yeah, but he's my ride.

971
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,083
Who?

972
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:31,041
Him.

973
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:32,583
Him?

974
00:58:32,666 --> 00:58:33,892
You're gonna leave
your life in his hands?

975
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:35,291
Seriously?

976
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:36,583
Seriously?

977
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:38,416
Can I Uber you home,
wherever it is?

978
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,708
Let's just go.

979
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:42,875
- Okay.
- Okay.

980
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,750
-Msithi.

981
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,333
How…

982
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:53,333
how do you get back in the game?

983
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:54,541
Let me school you.

984
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:56,025
When you're making
love to a woman…

985
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:57,125
Step one.

986
00:58:57,833 --> 00:58:58,916
Step two.

987
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,875
Aye! Nicki Minaj.

988
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:02,750
Ah! Face forward, back is mine!

989
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:04,000
- Slow.
- Hey, man!

990
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:04,958
The aim is not to rush…

991
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,601
- No, man!
- …remember you're in charge.

992
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:08,767
- Hey, man!
- When you get to the 4th round.

993
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:10,250
You do the Thuso Phala shake.

994
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:13,583
Then you release.

995
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:15,583
I got this!

996
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:18,791
Aye!

997
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:19,875
Ah!

998
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:23,458
Ah!

999
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:31,708
Where did you get this?

1000
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:33,458
It's on a wall in my house.

1001
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:36,291
I know it's in your
house… I mean like…

1002
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:37,375
like where's the…

1003
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:39,083
where did you buy it?

1004
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:43,250
Online photo of the day…

1005
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:45,583
just like blew it up
and put it on my wall.

1006
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,458
-I'm sorry it's not my...
-Relax.

1007
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:50,541
Oh, that's why.

1008
00:59:57,833 --> 01:00:00,208
Ah!

1009
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:04,416
Yoh, it's the Gqom party
vibe. Take me to Soweto!

1010
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,125
Yes, yes! Oh yeah!

1011
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:25,958
Ah…

1012
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:28,458
You know what, dancing is not…

1013
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,791
- You're going to hurt yourself.
- For everyone.

1014
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:32,458
You need a degree for this shit.

1015
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:33,708
- Yoh!
- Come here.

1016
01:00:34,708 --> 01:00:36,375
Huh-uh, huh-uh, Smash.

1017
01:00:37,916 --> 01:00:38,958
What?

1018
01:00:39,625 --> 01:00:40,833
What, what, what, like…

1019
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:42,375
I have protection.

1020
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:44,166
It… it's not that.

1021
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,208
Wait! Don't, don't…

1022
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:49,916
It's…

1023
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,601
It's not like you are
virgin or something right…

1024
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:54,208
coz that would be some
really fucked up shit.

1025
01:00:56,916 --> 01:00:58,833
-You are?

1026
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:01,416
No! Shit! Really?

1027
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:05,375
I'm just waiting for
somebody who really loves me.

1028
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:07,458
You know and…

1029
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:08,833
Someone special.

1030
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:10,625
Well, you're…

1031
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,833
special…

1032
01:01:11,916 --> 01:01:12,916
to me.

1033
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,666
Trust me, trust me. Listen.

1034
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:16,541
We're here…

1035
01:01:16,625 --> 01:01:19,083
in this moment right
now for a reason.

1036
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:32,166
Huh… Uh-uh.

1037
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:33,250
Stop.

1038
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:36,125
Please.

1039
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:37,208
I so… I…

1040
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:38,791
I just don't wanna do this.

1041
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:42,416
-I'm not ready.

1042
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:46,166
I love you.

1043
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:48,500
I mean I… I could love you.

1044
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:50,250
- I love you.
- I will love you.

1045
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:52,541
-I will…

1046
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,083
What are you saying?

1047
01:01:54,791 --> 01:01:56,083
Kedi…

1048
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:57,333
I love you.

1049
01:01:57,416 --> 01:01:59,500
-And I… will always love you.

1050
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,166
What… What are you saying?

1051
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:03,916
- Come on.
- Huh-uh. Huh-uh.

1052
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,541
Hmm-mm!

1053
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:07,541
If you…

1054
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:10,750
If you really, really,
really love me then…

1055
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:12,041
you'll wait.

1056
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:14,791
Alright.

1057
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:20,250
In the family…

1058
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,750
Are you sleeping for real?

1059
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:22,833
Hey, Babe…

1060
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:38,208
Smiso.

1061
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:39,291
Smiso!

1062
01:03:39,375 --> 01:03:40,791
You, get up!

1063
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,458
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh shit!

1064
01:03:44,166 --> 01:03:45,208
Are you serious?

1065
01:03:45,291 --> 01:03:47,583
Babe listen, when did you land?

1066
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:48,875
Fuck you!

1067
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,291
Now I know why
your phone is off!

1068
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:51,434
You were busy with this whore!

1069
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:52,500
In my house! Babe, I had…

1070
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:53,934
- I had an awards ceremony.
- Get your hands off me!

1071
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:54,958
You!

1072
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:56,642
Get your things and get
the fuck out of my house.

1073
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,666
Now!

1074
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:58,958
Pamela, leave her.

1075
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:01,333
Don't… You're don't have
to talk to her like that.

1076
01:04:01,416 --> 01:04:02,517
We are supposed to
be getting married.

1077
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:03,875
I am pregnant with your child

1078
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:06,708
but as soon as I turn my back
you fuck around like this!

1079
01:04:06,791 --> 01:04:08,583
What is wrong with you, Smiso!

1080
01:04:08,666 --> 01:04:09,666
I can explain.

1081
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,041
Are you still here!

1082
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:12,708
Get up and get out!

1083
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:16,625
Get the fuck out of my house.
Get the fuck out of my house!

1084
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:18,041
Don't talk to her like that.

1085
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:19,333
Leave me alone!

1086
01:04:19,416 --> 01:04:20,833
Get the fuck out of my house!

1087
01:04:20,916 --> 01:04:22,166
Baby…

1088
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:24,125
Eish! Shit!

1089
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:58,250
Kedibone…

1090
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:00,750
It's going to be alright.

1091
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,875
Don't be scared.

1092
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,333
Are you okay?

1093
01:05:08,916 --> 01:05:09,958
Yeah.

1094
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:13,291
Okay.

1095
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:14,833
We should go to bed.

1096
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:21,666
S… Step…

1097
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:35,375
on…

1098
01:06:55,708 --> 01:06:57,541
Please! One line, one line.

1099
01:06:58,208 --> 01:06:59,208
Please!

1100
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:08,750
Okay. It's time.

1101
01:07:11,791 --> 01:07:13,333
No wait, wait. Please!

1102
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:21,208
Well, you're pregnant.

1103
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:25,083
Fuck!

1104
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:26,541
Fuck!

1105
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,125
Eww Kedi!

1106
01:07:28,208 --> 01:07:30,000
Eww!

1107
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:32,083
Fuck!

1108
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:36,208
Are you gonna tell
your boyfriend?

1109
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:42,333
It's not his?

1110
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:46,250
So… what's the plan?

1111
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:52,791
Kedibone…

1112
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:54,795
What's going on? I'm in
the middle of my lecture.

1113
01:07:57,041 --> 01:07:58,166
I'm pregnant.

1114
01:07:59,916 --> 01:08:00,916
It's not mine.

1115
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,208
Dexter, a girl
always knows, okay.

1116
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:04,958
No… No, she doesn't.

1117
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:07,791
I want an abortion.

1118
01:08:21,541 --> 01:08:22,958
Um… okay.

1119
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:28,416
- Let's do it.
- I'm broke. I only have like… 2000.

1120
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:32,541
- And I need 7000.
- Yoh! I don't have that kind of money.

1121
01:09:16,166 --> 01:09:17,500
So, this is your cousin?

1122
01:09:18,916 --> 01:09:20,458
- Yes, I am the cousin.
- Yeah.

1123
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:34,500
So you're claiming
that's my child?

1124
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:53,875
Franco…

1125
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:59,416
I did everything
you asked me to do.

1126
01:10:01,541 --> 01:10:06,125
We'd go to fancy parties. Do my
make-up, dress up and then show up.

1127
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:10,083
This how you treat me?

1128
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:14,958
From being a crayfish to just
being pollution in the ocean?

1129
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,625
Is this how you see me now?

1130
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:24,041
You know what?

1131
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:27,166
I didn't send you…

1132
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:29,875
to be a porn star.
Do you hear me?

1133
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:32,833
Hmm? Busy entertaining
other men. Hmm!

1134
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:34,916
Like a whore. After everything!

1135
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,041
After everything I
have done for you!

1136
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:39,583
From me.

1137
01:10:39,666 --> 01:10:43,000
I sacrificed every
single thing for you.

1138
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:46,208
I sacrificed my youth and
my beauty for you, Franco.

1139
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:50,375
You took my virginity.

1140
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:55,125
And you took my money.

1141
01:10:55,916 --> 01:10:57,541
What did you do with all of it?

1142
01:10:58,958 --> 01:11:00,625
I paid for tuition.

1143
01:11:01,666 --> 01:11:02,791
And I have to eat.

1144
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,184
How much are we
talking about exactly?

1145
01:11:12,208 --> 01:11:13,250
Uh… Five thousand.

1146
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:14,541
Are you mad!

1147
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,666
Then I'm keeping it.

1148
01:11:24,958 --> 01:11:27,458
If the family finds out
about the pregnancy…

1149
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:28,708
they will come for you.

1150
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:32,458
I'm coming with.

1151
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:35,291
Let's go.

1152
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:38,166
Mavis, car keys!

1153
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:17,375
The biggest whore in
the fucking world!

1154
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:20,375
- What?
- We know you slept with her father.

1155
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:23,583
How could you do this to me?

1156
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:28,625
Don't you… Hey! Hey!

1157
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:30,750
Don't you dare touch her!

1158
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:51,375
-I need a drink.

1159
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:53,375
A drink like alcohol?

1160
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:54,791
- Yes.
- Now?

1161
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:56,083
Just drive.

1162
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,416
- How's things Msithi?
- Good thanks and yourself?

1163
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,250
I'm good, can I have the usual.

1164
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:05,541
Alright, sharp!

1165
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:09,083
I got a nice surprise for you.

1166
01:13:09,166 --> 01:13:10,291
Check this out.

1167
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:13,708
Who this is?

1168
01:13:17,166 --> 01:13:19,250
<i>Don't forget that you're paying.</i>

1169
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:23,083
<i>Touch is a move and
a move is a price.</i>

1170
01:13:23,166 --> 01:13:25,583
No man, is this not Kedibone?

1171
01:13:25,666 --> 01:13:27,333
- Yes, that's her.
- Mrembula's girl?

1172
01:13:28,083 --> 01:13:29,625
- Yers.
- Where did you get it?

1173
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:31,166
- Instagram.
- Oh, I see…

1174
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:32,333
You've got data, hey.

1175
01:13:32,416 --> 01:13:34,583
She's a slay queen now?

1176
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:38,041
- Thanks.
- Cheers!

1177
01:13:51,666 --> 01:13:53,791
I'm going to the bathroom, okay

1178
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,416
- What's up man.
- I'm good, what's up?

1179
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,291
Why are you checking
out my girl.

1180
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:04,476
- What's up with that?
- What?

1181
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,708
- What's up with that?
- Oh! Oh!

1182
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:08,791
Chill man, let me
show you something.

1183
01:14:10,541 --> 01:14:12,625
<i>Don't forget that you're paying.</i>

1184
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:15,125
<i>Touch is a move and
a move is a price.</i>

1185
01:14:15,208 --> 01:14:17,500
<i>Hey, he saw you!</i>

1186
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:22,416
Where did you get this?

1187
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,541
It's on the…

1188
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:26,375
You know what, forget it.

1189
01:14:43,416 --> 01:14:44,458
We're leaving.

1190
01:14:45,208 --> 01:14:46,583
Oh, baby.

1191
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:50,291
I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you.

1192
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:53,541
Kedibone are you cheating on me?

1193
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,875
- What?
- You heard me. Answer my question.

1194
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:58,458
Are you cheating?

1195
01:14:58,541 --> 01:14:59,750
No, baby.

1196
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:01,538
What are you talking about?

1197
01:15:01,583 --> 01:15:03,500
Explain to me why
there's a video of you…

1198
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:05,458
twerking on some random guys…

1199
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:08,916
On that guy's phone
back at the restaurant.

1200
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,666
So you are accusing
me of cheating?

1201
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:12,958
Seriously, Tebogo?

1202
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:16,500
I'm at school every day but
you're accusing me of cheating!

1203
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:21,541
You know what, it's fine.

1204
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:23,875
I can tell you've
found someone else.

1205
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,708
What!

1206
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:27,434
- You've found someone else.
- Someone else?

1207
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:28,684
- You got a new girlfriend Tebogo.
- Someone else?

1208
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:30,541
If you want to break
up do it like a man.

1209
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:32,125
What are you on about?

1210
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:35,000
I'm trying and…

1211
01:15:35,083 --> 01:15:37,333
Here I am thinking
I have your support.

1212
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:41,916
You're not being fair, baby.

1213
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,541
I'm sorry.

1214
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,541
Sorry. It's just…

1215
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:54,625
It's just that the way that
guy was looking at you…

1216
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:56,708
Next thing…

1217
01:15:56,791 --> 01:15:58,375
I see someone who
looks like you…

1218
01:15:58,458 --> 01:15:59,541
Babe…

1219
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:02,291
Cheating on you is the
last thing on my mind.

1220
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:08,750
Tebogo.

1221
01:16:10,458 --> 01:16:12,916
- Look at me.
- Please don't lie to me.

1222
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:15,958
Please don't lie to me.

1223
01:16:16,041 --> 01:16:17,791
I would never lie to you, baby.

1224
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,166
I would never lie to you.

1225
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:33,250
Oh, Msithi?

1226
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,625
We need to talk.

1227
01:16:42,333 --> 01:16:43,666
And Tebogo?

1228
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:45,625
I need to talk to you alone.

1229
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:47,916
What is it? Is everything okay?

1230
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:49,750
Are you cheating?

1231
01:16:51,458 --> 01:16:53,458
- What?
- Cut the crap!

1232
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:55,500
Don't act all innocent here.

1233
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:57,333
I see your promiscuous ways!

1234
01:16:57,416 --> 01:16:58,541
Me, promiscious?

1235
01:16:58,625 --> 01:17:00,208
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1236
01:17:00,958 --> 01:17:02,809
I have been seeing you
with these celebrity guys.

1237
01:17:02,833 --> 01:17:05,750
Driving Lamborghini's with big
bellies and high blood pressure.

1238
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:08,625
I am the dealer that side. You don't
think they tell me these things.

1239
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:14,958
You know…

1240
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:18,708
All wanted to do in
this industry was…

1241
01:17:18,791 --> 01:17:20,333
just to make it.

1242
01:17:25,666 --> 01:17:26,916
But then you meet…

1243
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:29,125
Can I call you crayfish?

1244
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:31,125
A young Thespian.

1245
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:34,041
I saw on Instagram that you are
looking for actors and models.

1246
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:35,416
So you do know who I am?

1247
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:38,375
To meet mercy people and then…

1248
01:17:39,916 --> 01:17:41,583
They sell you the world…

1249
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:42,875
What's this?

1250
01:17:43,916 --> 01:17:45,666
Possibilities!

1251
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:47,333
And you, Kedibone…

1252
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:49,083
You're perfect for this role.

1253
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,583
So, how much do you guys pay?

1254
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:52,708
Eighty thousand rand.

1255
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:54,000
Just for starters!

1256
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:57,250
I mean I am chilling with
actors, colleagues, producers.

1257
01:17:58,083 --> 01:18:02,041
How are you gonna get to know anyone in
the industry if you're chilling here?

1258
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:06,338
And then they just wanna
use you for your looks.

1259
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:09,208
Great fit!

1260
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:12,791
Woah!

1261
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,250
I didn't know how I was
going to tell Tebogo.

1262
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:34,916
I mean…

1263
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:37,250
He paid for my tuition…

1264
01:18:37,916 --> 01:18:40,291
by selling his inheritance!

1265
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:41,541
I know.

1266
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:48,416
I'm sorry.

1267
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:53,708
I'm not the one
you're cheating on.

1268
01:18:53,791 --> 01:18:56,958
You need to apologise
to Mrembula not me!

1269
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,708
Yes, I know Msithi.

1270
01:19:02,375 --> 01:19:03,416
Can I use your phone?

1271
01:19:04,541 --> 01:19:07,458
I wanna call these other girls.
They wanted to come fetch me and…

1272
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:10,083
I just wanna cancel
my plans, please.

1273
01:19:10,166 --> 01:19:11,750
You're sleeping around…

1274
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:13,875
but you can't afford airtime?

1275
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:23,958
Thank you.

1276
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:57,625
Msithi?

1277
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:00,416
Thank you.

1278
01:20:02,041 --> 01:20:03,125
Stop!

1279
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:07,541
Bloody cheater!

1280
01:20:52,375 --> 01:20:55,083
<i>You have reached the
voicemail box of…</i>

1281
01:20:55,166 --> 01:20:56,458
<i>Yeah, Cray, Cray.</i>

1282
01:20:57,458 --> 01:20:58,666
<i>You put me on voicemail.</i>

1283
01:21:00,625 --> 01:21:02,000
<i>Hey!</i>

1284
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:03,875
<i>You took me for a ride.</i>

1285
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:06,708
<i>And played with my heart.</i>

1286
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:10,291
<i>You know, Crayfish…</i>

1287
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:13,458
<i>I gave you everything I have.</i>

1288
01:21:13,541 --> 01:21:15,625
<i>I was there for you emotionally.</i>

1289
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:17,500
<i>Financially.</i>

1290
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:19,083
<i>Physically.</i>

1291
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:22,458
<i>And you just drop
me automatically.</i>

1292
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,833
<i>Hey Crayfish… Crayfish!</i>

1293
01:21:30,833 --> 01:21:32,958
<i>You hurt me Crayfish.</i>

1294
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:41,333
Cray…

1295
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:43,666
Eish!

1296
01:21:47,916 --> 01:21:49,166
Woah!

1297
01:21:50,291 --> 01:21:51,916
Life is tough!

1298
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,083
Hey!

1299
01:22:06,541 --> 01:22:07,916
Thank you. Thank you.

1300
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,250
Thank you very much.

1301
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:11,875
-You know this one's
for you, right?

1302
01:22:15,666 --> 01:22:19,166
Smash, Smash, Smash, Smash!

1303
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:32,500
Can I have a word?

1304
01:22:33,708 --> 01:22:34,625
What!

1305
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:36,541
I've meant to give you a call.

1306
01:22:36,625 --> 01:22:39,000
It's just I realised I
don't even have your number.

1307
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:41,458
You already got what you wanted.

1308
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:42,708
Listen…

1309
01:22:44,541 --> 01:22:45,875
I came to apologise.

1310
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:47,333
I should have said that I'm…

1311
01:22:48,291 --> 01:22:49,333
engaged.

1312
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:56,666
You must think I'm a dog.

1313
01:22:57,333 --> 01:22:58,458
Dogs are cute!

1314
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:00,750
You are evil, Smash!

1315
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:03,333
Hey, come on, I…

1316
01:23:03,416 --> 01:23:04,833
You raped me.

1317
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:07,625
Rape?

1318
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:09,666
Kedi, I didn't…

1319
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:10,750
I didn't rape you.

1320
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:13,875
We both got back…

1321
01:23:13,958 --> 01:23:15,666
You raped me, Smash.

1322
01:23:22,666 --> 01:23:24,041
Hear me out. Hear me out.

1323
01:23:25,291 --> 01:23:26,500
I genuinely wanna help you.

1324
01:23:27,208 --> 01:23:28,684
You said you wanna
get into the industry.

1325
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:30,041
I wanna hook you up. I wanna…

1326
01:23:30,125 --> 01:23:31,476
- I want you to meet my people.
- You know what.

1327
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,300
- Get into his book…
- You're wasting my time.

1328
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:36,375
Kedi…

1329
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:37,458
Kedi…

1330
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:41,375
Smash! Smash! Smash!

1331
01:23:54,458 --> 01:23:55,500
Hello.

1332
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,666
I brought some baby clothes.

1333
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Thank you.

1334
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,250
Themba.

1335
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:52,291
Come get the baby.

1336
01:25:11,166 --> 01:25:12,166
So…

1337
01:25:14,833 --> 01:25:16,500
How's life been treating you?

1338
01:25:25,458 --> 01:25:26,458
Fine.

1339
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:54,291
I'm sorry.

1340
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,083
Hi, baby.

1341
01:26:34,083 --> 01:26:36,125
Okay where are you taking me?

1342
01:26:38,958 --> 01:26:41,041
Yeah, but how must
I know what to wear

1343
01:26:41,125 --> 01:26:42,765
when I don't know
where you're taking me.

1344
01:26:43,833 --> 01:26:46,083
Baby, come on, you
know I hate surprises.

1345
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:50,583
Okay, okay fine.

1346
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:51,875
Cool.

1347
01:26:57,375 --> 01:27:00,166
Ah! Crayfish!

1348
01:27:00,791 --> 01:27:04,791
I don't like how things
ended between us.

1349
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:07,083
- I know your birthday is coming up.
- Don't touch me!

1350
01:27:07,833 --> 01:27:08,916
Yoh!

1351
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,791
I bought you something, hey.

1352
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:12,875
Voila!

1353
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:14,750
You bought me a car?

1354
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,458
This is not just any car.

1355
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:20,250
This is a machine.

1356
01:27:21,875 --> 01:27:23,916
I'm fine. You can keep it.

1357
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,375
Ah!

1358
01:27:25,458 --> 01:27:26,833
Since when?

1359
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:30,458
I'm moving out.

1360
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:33,166
- Where to?
- I'm going back home.

1361
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,625
Am I a joke to you?

1362
01:27:38,083 --> 01:27:40,250
I will tell you when to leave.

1363
01:27:41,083 --> 01:27:43,166
I'm the one paying
for this apartment.

1364
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:44,666
Do you hear me!

1365
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:46,708
And you still owe me.

1366
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:49,916
One last round.

1367
01:27:50,666 --> 01:27:53,333
- Where do you think you're going?
- Don't touch me!

1368
01:27:53,416 --> 01:27:54,767
- Get off me!
- You're my whore, I own you.

1369
01:27:54,791 --> 01:27:56,041
Now shut up!

1370
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:02,958
Kedibone!

1371
01:28:04,583 --> 01:28:05,958
Baby…

1372
01:28:06,666 --> 01:28:07,934
He's the agent I told you about.

1373
01:28:07,958 --> 01:28:09,250
Agent?

1374
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:12,791
Kedibone what's going on here?

1375
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:15,941
- Huh?
- Guess who's in trouble now.

1376
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:17,916
I'm sorry, baby.

1377
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,750
Here's the story young
man, listen carefully.

1378
01:28:21,583 --> 01:28:24,625
I know this looks bad.

1379
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:27,208
But I'll save you the heartache.

1380
01:28:27,291 --> 01:28:28,291
Kedibone?

1381
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:31,041
There's a lot of women out there
and they're still gonna hurt you.

1382
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:33,833
I know because I was once
a young man like you.

1383
01:28:33,916 --> 01:28:35,666
They'll hurt you real bad.

1384
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:38,000
You see how full of
fish the ocean is?

1385
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:40,750
Crayfish there,
crayfish all over.

1386
01:28:40,833 --> 01:28:41,958
And you know what you did?

1387
01:28:42,041 --> 01:28:43,833
You chose one crayfish and…

1388
01:28:43,916 --> 01:28:45,076
And you put it in the fridge.

1389
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:47,208
And left the door unlocked.

1390
01:28:47,791 --> 01:28:49,791
What did you think
was going to happen?

1391
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:52,875
I opened the door and helped
myself to some crayfish.

1392
01:28:52,958 --> 01:28:54,541
And it was appetising.

1393
01:28:54,625 --> 01:28:56,375
I must say, your
crayfish is delicious.

1394
01:28:56,458 --> 01:28:57,875
Never tasted anything better...

1395
01:28:57,958 --> 01:29:01,791
-Tebogo, please.

1396
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:04,250
Tebogo you're hurting him.

1397
01:29:04,333 --> 01:29:05,333
Tebogo stop!

1398
01:29:05,416 --> 01:29:06,416
Let him go.

1399
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,625
Let go of me!

1400
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:09,958
Tebogo no, no no…

1401
01:29:10,916 --> 01:29:12,583
Please don't kill me, I'm sorry.

1402
01:29:12,666 --> 01:29:14,875
Let's talk about
this. C'mon man.

1403
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:23,458
Let's go.

1404
01:29:23,541 --> 01:29:26,625
Tebogo you're hurting
me, let me go!

1405
01:29:32,083 --> 01:29:35,291
Tebogo you are hurting me.

1406
01:29:35,375 --> 01:29:36,625
Let go of me.

1407
01:29:36,708 --> 01:29:39,416
- Shut up!
- Baby, I'm sorry.

1408
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,666
Baby, I'm sorry.

1409
01:29:42,583 --> 01:29:45,291
Baby, listen, I'm sorry.

1410
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:47,208
- Get inside.
- Please.

1411
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:50,708
-Kedibone Manamela.

1412
01:29:51,333 --> 01:29:52,375
My pure innocent woman.

1413
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:53,458
Virgin!

1414
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:55,958
Virgin!

1415
01:29:56,666 --> 01:29:57,708
You!

1416
01:29:58,750 --> 01:29:59,750
Jesus!

1417
01:30:00,916 --> 01:30:02,476
<i>Your dad left you a good
inheritance in this car.</i>

1418
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,166
<i>-He did!</i>

1419
01:30:07,833 --> 01:30:10,166
<i>I just wanna study, baby.</i>

1420
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:11,541
- Baby, please.
- Don't touch me!

1421
01:30:11,625 --> 01:30:13,291
Tell me about your agent.

1422
01:30:13,375 --> 01:30:14,625
It's really not what you think.

1423
01:30:14,708 --> 01:30:16,375
Kedibone Manamela!

1424
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:18,125
- Baby, I'm sorry.
- Jesus!

1425
01:30:18,208 --> 01:30:19,833
I'm sorry, baby!

1426
01:30:19,916 --> 01:30:22,750
You are sorry? Are you
sorry for my father's car.

1427
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:25,208
I love you, baby.

1428
01:30:26,875 --> 01:30:28,541
Baby, no!
