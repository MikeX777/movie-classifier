1
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:39,917
-Nice knife.
-Beautiful, isn't it?

2
00:00:40,118 --> 00:00:44,282
Very nicely done.
And totally made by hand.

3
00:00:44,623 --> 00:00:47,114
And here are other specialties...

4
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:50,921
crafted by my own handiwork.

5
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:54,997
Everything done by me.
And, well... I'm selling them.

6
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,328
-Is this a marble handle?
-No, it's not marble.

7
00:00:58,537 --> 00:01:03,031
It's made from a bone
from the leg of an ostrich.

8
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:07,142
And this one's walnut.
It's only found in San Luís.

9
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:08,540
It's a special tree.

10
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:11,443
-Found only there?
-Yes, only in San Luís.

11
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,675
I have relatives who work there
and sent it to me.

12
00:01:13,885 --> 00:01:15,648
-Hard wood, right?
-Very hard.

13
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:17,754
-Fantastic.
-Very beautiful.

14
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:21,153
Makes a nice souvenir.
That 's why I'm offering it.

15
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,419
It's a rare wood, right?

16
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:26,928
It's from a ship that
sunk in the year 1800.

17
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:30,062
-You don't say!
-I found it on the shore.

18
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:33,432
Well, it's a handle
full of history.

19
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:37,541
-How much?
-The work alone's worth 100 pesos.

20
00:01:37,743 --> 00:01:40,576
-100 pesos?!
-Yes. But look at the finishing.

21
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:42,610
It's not easy to earn 100 pesos.

22
00:01:42,814 --> 00:01:45,339
lf I had that much,
I wouldn't work here.

23
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:49,416
-Well, it's that...
-No, it's too much money.

24
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:54,787
-I could take 80.
-No, no, no.

25
00:01:54,993 --> 00:01:56,551
-80, how about that?
-No, no.

26
00:01:56,762 --> 00:01:59,424
No? Okay, let's go on.

27
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:02,566
Let 's see if anyone likes
this one here.

28
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:05,293
-I like them all.
-Yeah.

29
00:02:05,604 --> 00:02:08,334
Make me an offer and
I'll tell you if I take it.

30
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,474
-This is how I make a living now.
-This is very nice...

31
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:12,644
very nice for
crazyman Contreras.

32
00:02:13,412 --> 00:02:16,813
Not nice enough for you.

33
00:02:17,015 --> 00:02:18,607
There it is!

34
00:02:18,817 --> 00:02:20,944
Make me an offer, guys.

35
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:22,711
Come on.

36
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:24,479
-let 's go back to work.
-What do you think?

37
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,521
We gotta get started.
Let 's get to work.

38
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:30,354
-Well, guys...
-Bye, old man.

39
00:02:30,562 --> 00:02:32,154
I'm ready.

40
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:35,864
Coco, we didn't sell anything today.
Things are looking bad.

41
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:20,235
Hey, listen!

42
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:22,879
Those are excellent knives!

43
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:25,015
I mean it!

44
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:02,915
Good morning, pal.

45
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:04,952
Good morning.

46
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:09,854
Haven't you seen the sign
on your way in?

47
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:12,363
What sign, mister?
I didn't see it.

48
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:15,363
You're on private property, pal.

49
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:19,025
I'm sorry, sir.
It's just that...

50
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:22,729
I came to try and sell knives
to the guys there...

51
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:24,806
Under whose authorization?

52
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,773
No one's, sir.

53
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:29,538
You'll have to follow me.

54
00:04:29,748 --> 00:04:32,239
Papers, please.

55
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:34,949
Just a minute, please.

56
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:38,418
I don't think I have them here.

57
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:41,615
I forgot to take them
when I went out.

58
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:45,820
I'm sorry.
Must have left them at home.

59
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:48,929
How much for this one?

60
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:52,229
-This one?
-Yes.

61
00:04:58,276 --> 00:05:01,040
You can keep it.

62
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:09,481
Listen, signs are made to be read.

63
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:13,590
Yes.
That 's what I'll do next time.

64
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,520
You may go, pal.

65
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:19,052
Hey, Villegas!

66
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:21,316
How are you doing?

67
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:23,187
-How now, Sabino?
-How are you?

68
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:27,397
All nice and clean, huh?

69
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,827
Just because I got fired!

70
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:32,595
They want to reopen
in the spring.

71
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:34,271
I have your things there.

72
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:37,635
-Thanks.
-What about the knives?

73
00:06:37,842 --> 00:06:39,776
I think they're
a little too pricey.

74
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:42,572
-Pricey?
-I'll try to bring the price down.

75
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:46,911
Well, they're importing Brazilian
knives now, they're much cheaper.

76
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:49,586
But mine are handcrafted.

77
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:54,248
The only thing people
care about is that they cut.

78
00:06:56,261 --> 00:06:58,161
-How's Rosa?
-She's fine.

79
00:06:58,363 --> 00:07:01,093
Seems that an employment agency...

80
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,563
found her work at a hotel,
as cleaning lady.

81
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:05,861
It's easier for a woman.

82
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:08,938
Besides, she's young.
What are we to do?

83
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,664
I'm hanging on for now,
but sooner or later...

84
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,901
I guess it'll be my turn to get
a swift kick in the butt.

85
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:20,214
There are your tools
and a box with your belongings.

86
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:21,885
-Sit down.
-Okay.

87
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:24,282
Let 's have some tea.

88
00:07:24,556 --> 00:07:26,751
I'll give you a mattress.

89
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,892
You can keep it. lf I need it,
I'll ask you to return it.

90
00:07:29,094 --> 00:07:32,291
No. I left it there because
I didn't have any place for it.

91
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,775
Where's Borzi now?

92
00:07:45,977 --> 00:07:49,936
-He went to Rosário, to his brother.
-Wasn't his brother in jail?

93
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:53,044
And he'll stay there,
because he got about 30 years.

94
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:56,277
Seems Borzi was kinda
fond of his sister-in-Iaw.

95
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:04,492
So, is everything of yours there?
Nothing missing?

96
00:08:04,763 --> 00:08:07,323
Yes, but that doesn't matter.
It's okay.

97
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:11,499
Tell me, that agency
where Rosa got her job...

98
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:12,931
what 's the address?

99
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:17,570
-Name?
-Juan Villegas.

100
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:18,765
-Villega?
-Villegas.

101
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:23,414
V-I-I-I-E-G-A-S.

102
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:25,947
But everybody calls me Coco.

103
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:28,384
Profession?

104
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:32,386
Mechanic.
Well, light mechanics.

105
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:37,823
-Are you a mechanic or aren't you?
-I am. You can put ''mechanic'' there.

106
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,460
I used to work at a gas station.

107
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:45,033
-And what happened?
-Well, it was sold.

108
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:47,602
The gas station was sold recently.

109
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:52,172
I did a bit of everything there.
Lubricated...

110
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:56,543
Hello?

111
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:03,343
Listen... listen...

112
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:06,490
It's not my problem if they don't
pay you what was agreed upon!

113
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:07,780
No, no, no...

114
00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:10,893
our company is not liable for
problems with third-party employers.

115
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:14,793
Read carefully
the contract you signed.

116
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:19,201
No, I'm not interested
in what you think!

117
00:09:19,404 --> 00:09:22,999
No! I'll delete you from the
system, that 's it! Simple as that.

118
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:27,409
You do whatever you want!

119
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:33,975
-Age?
-52.

120
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:36,345
Is that a problem?

121
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:38,646
No.

122
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:43,089
Well, in this country,
anything can be a problem.

123
00:09:43,294 --> 00:09:46,058
-Married or single?
-Married.

124
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:52,100
But you can put ''single''.
I haven't seen my wife in 20 years.

125
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,329
-I'll put ''single''.
-Single.

126
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:09,984
-Residence?
-I'm living with my daughter...

127
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:12,349
in Fitz Roy.

128
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:15,683
Things are getting difficult.

129
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:24,131
Okay, you've been added
to the system.

130
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:26,393
How will it be, then?

131
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:29,198
-May I contact your daughter?
-Yes.

132
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:31,739
But since I'm always
around here anyway...

133
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:34,935
No. Here's my card.

134
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:38,115
-There's my phone. You call me.
-Mr. Barreiro...

135
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:43,884
sometimes, in my spare time,
I make knife handles.

136
00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:46,079
lf you're interested...

137
00:10:46,457 --> 00:10:48,254
lf you want, I can show you.

138
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:51,189
No, no. Not now.

139
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:53,694
-But they're right here.
-No, not now.

140
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:55,729
Okay.

141
00:10:58,136 --> 00:11:01,003
Where's the bottle?

142
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:05,406
Look, the milk's gone sour!

143
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,910
Hush, love. You haven't
even been cleaned yet. Yeah, baby.

144
00:11:10,114 --> 00:11:11,775
I gotta do everything around here.

145
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:14,850
0n your feet, lazybones!
Nice example you're setting!

146
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:17,180
-Are you going to the bathroom?
-You can go, but don't take long!

147
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:19,618
Here, watch her a bit!

148
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,393
Watch your daughter, come on!

149
00:11:28,132 --> 00:11:30,862
Milk for the baby, come on!

150
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:33,627
Come on, hurry,
you're gonna be late for school!

151
00:11:33,838 --> 00:11:38,935
Come, Tucumano, get a move on.
Take care of the baby.

152
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,244
Quick!

153
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:51,506
-Wanna check the oil?
-No, no need to.

154
00:12:51,716 --> 00:12:54,184
That 'll be 28.50.

155
00:12:55,453 --> 00:12:57,887
You been working here long?

156
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:00,683
No, not for very long.

157
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:04,658
-Do you like the work?
-So-so.

158
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:09,357
I've worked at a gas station
for almost 20 years.

159
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,935
Cool.

160
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:16,498
Your change. Thanks.

161
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,539
Wait, I almost forgot.

162
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:23,476
This is a special offer
from the gas station.

163
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:25,546
You have to scratch it
with a coin.

164
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,750
-The coin you gave me?
-Exactly.

165
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:32,748
-Here?
-Yeah, right there.

166
00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:40,497
-There's something written there.
-let me see.

167
00:13:40,798 --> 00:13:45,701
You've won a liter of oil.
Come with me. See?

168
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:48,371
And you also won
a pair of sunglasses...

169
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:50,564
like the ones in the movie
''Men In Black''.

170
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:54,176
-Have you seen that movie?
-No, I don't think so.

171
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:58,106
-Come in. Here.
-Thanks.

172
00:13:58,316 --> 00:14:00,284
Mario, he just won a prize.

173
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:02,180
Congratulations, sir.
How do you do?

174
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:04,582
Go fetch the prize from the back.

175
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:06,518
-Right away.
-Here it is.

176
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:09,989
I'll write down your name
and give you your prize.

177
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:13,652
-Today's my lucky day.
-Indeed, it must be.

178
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:21,268
You know if they need
a mechanic or a gas clerk here?

179
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:24,305
No, we don't have any openings.

180
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:27,945
-Have you tried the Gypsy's garage?
-No.

181
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:30,706
It's near the exit for Cañadón.

182
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:32,382
They're always hiring there.

183
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:36,314
Anything will do.

184
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:38,216
Getting a job is what counts.

185
00:14:38,423 --> 00:14:41,449
Excuse me.
I brought the oil and the glasses.

186
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:44,457
-Here they are.
-Great.

187
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:47,888
-They must be worth a lot.
-Yes.

188
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:52,700
Put them on,
let's see how they look.

189
00:14:55,072 --> 00:15:00,408
-You look like a man in black.
-I bet you can't see a thing.

190
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:03,409
-Are you gonna put them on now?
-No, I'll put them away.

191
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:10,186
GYPSY'S TIRE REPAIR SHOP

192
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:13,920
What do you want?

193
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,218
-Is your boss around?
-No, he's out to lunch.

194
00:15:16,427 --> 00:15:18,657
-Can I wait for him?
-What for?

195
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:22,327
It's personal.

196
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:26,636
You can wait outside, if you want.

197
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:29,766
Okay, thanks.

198
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:47,183
Look, if you're selling something,
nobody here's gonna buy anything.

199
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:50,189
No, I'm not selling anything.

200
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:09,872
Shit!

201
00:16:11,082 --> 00:16:14,916
Tribilín, who the hell
parked in the driveway?

202
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:17,417
I'm sorry,
I'll move it right away.

203
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:21,319
Haven't you seen the sign?
What did I paint it for?

204
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:24,461
N0 PARKING
Goddamn.

205
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:33,963
Let 's go, quick.

206
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:37,737
Keep the TV down, baby's asleep.

207
00:16:37,942 --> 00:16:40,433
Mauro, later, I want you
to show me the grade you got.

208
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:43,808
-Okay.
-I already know about it.

209
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:47,017
-What are you doing?
-I'm fixing the plumbing.

210
00:16:47,218 --> 00:16:50,346
-I'll find something to mend it.
-I think...

211
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:54,284
it would be best to replace
the pipe. Then it'll be perfect.

212
00:16:54,892 --> 00:16:56,792
And how much
is that gonna cost me?

213
00:16:56,994 --> 00:17:00,191
I don't know.
How much should I charge you?

214
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:03,333
It's not expensive.
I'll take care of it.

215
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:05,764
Listen, Dad...

216
00:17:06,571 --> 00:17:10,132
Earlier today, at the gas station,
they called me back.

217
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:13,742
They told me to scratch a card.

218
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:17,176
I scratched it and I got a prize.

219
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:22,648
A can of oil and sunglasses
like the ones you see on the TV.

220
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:27,847
I almost asked for the prize in cash,
but I didn't have the heart to do it.

221
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:33,058
I'll see if I can buy a grindstone
with my severance pay.

222
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:37,225
You keep spending your money like
that, you'll end up selling your car.

223
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:39,164
The knife business...

224
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:43,306
won't work if I don't
make them. It's no use.

225
00:17:43,507 --> 00:17:46,999
Why don't you get a job
doing what you do best?

226
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:55,041
Look... there are so many
new gas stations around.

227
00:18:01,392 --> 00:18:06,420
Well, I'm going to Vasco's store
to buy a new length of pipe.

228
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:10,829
Otherwise, Lucia,
you won't have water today.

229
00:18:56,847 --> 00:19:00,112
-Good morning. Something wrong?
-Actually, I don't know.

230
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:03,912
I heard a noise, like something
cracking. I stopped to take a look.

231
00:19:04,121 --> 00:19:05,918
Don't worry,
I'll check it out for you.

232
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:07,488
Thanks.

233
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:17,933
-Is it bad?
-No.

234
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:21,263
The fan pulley is cracked.

235
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,935
It needs to be welded.

236
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,537
You can see it was
already badly welded.

237
00:19:30,748 --> 00:19:33,911
It happened to my dad.
This car belonged to him.

238
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:39,317
-Is it easy to fix?
-Well, if I had a welding arc...

239
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:42,457
But around here...

240
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,595
I have a welding arc down
at the ranch. They always use it...

241
00:19:45,796 --> 00:19:48,526
but it's 150 km from here.

242
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:55,294
We're gonna have to tow it.

243
00:19:55,506 --> 00:19:57,804
There's no other way.

244
00:19:58,008 --> 00:20:00,169
Look, it's 150 km.
It's not nearby.

245
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:03,947
-Have you got the time?
-That 's the one thing I've got.

246
00:20:12,523 --> 00:20:14,514
Do you live around here?

247
00:20:14,725 --> 00:20:18,388
No. I'm living in Buenos Aires now.
I was born in Telken.

248
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:21,163
I'm from Patagonia,
even though it's hard to tell.

249
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:24,701
-Do you mind if I smoke?
-No.

250
00:20:24,902 --> 00:20:27,029
-Dou you wanna smoke?
-Thanks, I don't smoke.

251
00:20:27,238 --> 00:20:31,038
I'll smoke now,
because my mom won't let me.

252
00:20:32,743 --> 00:20:36,270
I'm 33 years old,
but she still yells at me.

253
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,108
And now your dad is going
to yell at you because of the car.

254
00:20:39,316 --> 00:20:41,113
No. My father is dead.

255
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,719
-I'm really sorry.
-No, it's okay.

256
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:48,915
He died 18 months ago.

257
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,661
What do you do for a living?

258
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:57,895
Well, I used to work
at a gas station.

259
00:20:58,102 --> 00:21:02,061
-Now I carve knife handles.
-Knife handles?

260
00:21:02,273 --> 00:21:06,141
-Take a look, they're in my bag.
-let me see.

261
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:10,906
They're very beautiful.

262
00:21:11,348 --> 00:21:12,713
What 's this one made of?

263
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:17,149
A special wood
from the Misiones forest.

264
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:21,051
A friend of mine who lives there
sent the wood to me.

265
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,029
This one looks like a face.
Is it a face?

266
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,790
It 'll be the head of a puma.

267
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:31,131
So you're an artist!

268
00:21:31,936 --> 00:21:34,336
No... well... thanks.

269
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:48,042
I'll go see Mom,
she must be worried sick.

270
00:21:48,252 --> 00:21:50,482
Can you tell me
where the welding tools are?

271
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:52,747
Look in the shed.
Must be there.

272
00:21:56,327 --> 00:21:58,557
Good afternoon.

273
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:01,488
Good afternoon, ma'am.

274
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:04,634
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

275
00:22:04,835 --> 00:22:06,860
So my daughter dragged you
all the way out here.

276
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:11,007
It doesn't matter.
Things that happen.

277
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:15,770
-Especially on the road.
-When this one sets her mind...

278
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,349
She's so stubborn. She insisted on
going to Comodoro to sell the car.

279
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:22,849
Nobody drives it.
It 'll end up going to waste.

280
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:26,216
But this isn't just any old car.

281
00:22:26,423 --> 00:22:29,654
-Yes, it's a fine automobile.
-Exactly. See?

282
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,090
You can't just sell it like that!

283
00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:34,787
Is it anything very complicated?

284
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:36,933
No, Mom,
he's just welding a pulley.

285
00:22:37,134 --> 00:22:39,694
Let him explain.

286
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:44,667
I just have to weld this
pulley and it's done.

287
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,002
Then we'll put it back...

288
00:22:47,211 --> 00:22:51,238
Isn't that gonna cost me?
With the present situation...

289
00:22:51,582 --> 00:22:54,483
I still don't know.
We'll see later on.

290
00:22:54,685 --> 00:22:58,451
-Think about it when you sell it.
-To repay you for your trouble...

291
00:22:58,656 --> 00:23:01,147
you could stay
and have tea with us.

292
00:23:02,526 --> 00:23:05,654
See this?
It's made here. All homemade.

293
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:09,196
-Very difficuIt to find in town.
-Delicious.

294
00:23:09,466 --> 00:23:12,401
Dad was a specialist
in fruit jams, wasn't he?

295
00:23:12,603 --> 00:23:16,232
I could never make them
like he did. Try the cookies.

296
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,499
Those over there.

297
00:23:19,376 --> 00:23:22,209
The recipe's from a family
who lives nearby.

298
00:23:22,613 --> 00:23:26,310
I'll fill two jars of jam
for you to take home.

299
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:28,576
Great. Thanks.

300
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,624
What did your husband
do for a living?

301
00:23:34,825 --> 00:23:37,623
-Well, what he didn't do!
-Everything, except politics.

302
00:23:38,195 --> 00:23:41,756
Yes, but he always liked
to be on top of current events.

303
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:45,561
He was the first to bring Hereford
livestock to Patagonia.

304
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:49,967
He organized wild hog hunts,
planted native fruits...

305
00:23:50,174 --> 00:23:54,406
He always had some project going.
Couldn't stand still.

306
00:23:54,712 --> 00:23:56,680
But, in his own way,
he lived happily.

307
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,543
His last endeavor was with dogs.

308
00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:04,084
He wanted to breed
Argentine dogos and export them.

309
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:07,189
But he didn't live
long enough to do it.

310
00:24:07,391 --> 00:24:10,053
Have you seen that breed?
They're big, white dogs.

311
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,718
-Yes, I think I've seen them.
-They're fighting dogs, aren't they?

312
00:24:13,931 --> 00:24:15,592
lf you raise them to do that.

313
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:17,699
Otherwise, they're as gentle
a creature as any.

314
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:20,563
Mom, they were genetically
bred to be fighting dogs.

315
00:24:20,771 --> 00:24:23,604
-No one is born evil.
-They're not evil, they're fierce.

316
00:24:23,807 --> 00:24:26,503
No! They're just hounds.

317
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,669
Listen, wouldn't you like to take
the one we have here with you?

318
00:24:32,716 --> 00:24:33,910
A dog?

319
00:24:34,418 --> 00:24:36,682
I guarantee that, as soon as
you see him, you'll want him.

320
00:24:39,623 --> 00:24:43,650
It's just that I'm going
through some dire straits.

321
00:24:43,861 --> 00:24:46,853
-And to keep a dog...
-They're rustic beasts.

322
00:24:47,064 --> 00:24:48,531
It's no problem at all.
They adapt easily.

323
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:51,257
My husband bought him
to set up his kennel...

324
00:24:51,468 --> 00:24:53,902
but he died shortly after
the dog arrived.

325
00:24:54,104 --> 00:24:56,231
He's the puppy of a famous dog.

326
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,501
Yes, of a great champion.
It's a thoroughbred dog.

327
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:03,339
I have his pedigree.

328
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:09,109
Breaks my heart to see him wandering
around all day, poor thing.

329
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:13,779
You see, I'm in no condition
to take care of a dog anymore.

330
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:18,724
Take a look. Could be a great
company to someone lonely.

331
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:23,161
You'll find him sad. But he was
very happy when he got here.

332
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,733
I'd be happy to know
he's with someone like you.

333
00:25:25,936 --> 00:25:28,097
I found his papers.

334
00:25:28,305 --> 00:25:31,570
Look, here's the name of his father:
Quilapán de los Andes.

335
00:25:31,775 --> 00:25:35,006
-A great champion.
-Here's his registration number.

336
00:25:35,212 --> 00:25:38,773
And the vaccination schedule.
Here it is: Le Chien Kennel.

337
00:25:38,982 --> 00:25:41,416
''Le Chien'' because
my husband was French.

338
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:44,644
You'll see what
a fantastic dog. Come.

339
00:25:44,855 --> 00:25:47,915
Careful, there's a ditch there.

340
00:25:51,195 --> 00:25:54,596
Everything was left
unfinished here.

341
00:25:56,633 --> 00:25:58,294
Come in.

342
00:25:58,535 --> 00:26:01,504
LE CHIEN KENNEL

343
00:26:04,575 --> 00:26:07,203
So, what do you think?

344
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:21,057
Classy dog, isn't he?

345
00:27:01,865 --> 00:27:05,323
Out. Out.

346
00:27:10,474 --> 00:27:12,066
Out.

347
00:27:14,144 --> 00:27:16,169
Let 's go home.

348
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,100
VACCINATION SCHEDULE

349
00:27:48,078 --> 00:27:49,306
DOGBREEDERS' FEDERATION
OF ARGENTINA

350
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:18,802
Come on, Le Chien. Come.

351
00:28:22,546 --> 00:28:25,106
Let 's go home.

352
00:28:29,953 --> 00:28:31,716
Come, Le Chien.

353
00:28:31,922 --> 00:28:35,380
Mom, come see!
There's a white dog outside!

354
00:28:35,592 --> 00:28:38,083
What? What do you mean, a dog?

355
00:28:38,295 --> 00:28:40,354
Honest! There's a white dog there.

356
00:28:40,964 --> 00:28:42,329
Where did that dog come from?

357
00:28:42,532 --> 00:28:43,624
Tucumano?

358
00:28:43,934 --> 00:28:45,765
What dog is that, Dad?

359
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,104
He's on a leash.
He won't do anything, dear.

360
00:28:49,373 --> 00:28:53,434
What is that dog doing here, Dad?

361
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:56,169
-I brought him.
-What kind of idea is that?

362
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,975
-Mom, he's trying to break free!
-See? Are you insane?

363
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:03,118
Tucumano, Tucumano!
Take that dog away from here!

364
00:29:03,353 --> 00:29:06,254
You've never wanted a dog in
your life! What idea is that now?

365
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:09,755
What 's gotten into you, Dad?
Tell me!

366
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,353
Take that dog away, Tucumano.
I can't even hang my laundry to dry.

367
00:29:14,564 --> 00:29:17,863
I don't want any dogs here!
Understand?

368
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:19,626
Okay?

369
00:29:19,936 --> 00:29:22,234
I don't want dogs here!

370
00:29:46,863 --> 00:29:48,956
-It's done, sir.
-Thank you.

371
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:51,532
That gentleman there
wants to talk to you.

372
00:29:51,735 --> 00:29:54,499
-Which one?
-That one over there.

373
00:30:02,846 --> 00:30:04,780
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

374
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:07,745
-Is the dog yours?
-Yes.

375
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:10,715
Well, I have a warehouse
full of wool...

376
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:13,913
and I need some surveillance.

377
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:16,851
Well...

378
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,086
Just for three or four days.
Until the wool is transported.

379
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:24,026
I never leave my dog alone.

380
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:29,336
No, no, no. I'll hire you as
a guard along with your dog.

381
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:36,474
I'll pay you 30 pesos a day.
What do you say?

382
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,672
-I think it's okay.
-Come with me.

383
00:30:39,883 --> 00:30:42,852
lf one Galván,
the previous guard, shows up...

384
00:30:43,053 --> 00:30:46,318
and he's drunk,
do not let him in.

385
00:30:46,523 --> 00:30:49,515
lf he wants to get his things,
tell him to come back tomorrow...

386
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:51,421
in the afternoon, when I'm here.

387
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:56,122
And if he insists too much,
sic the dog on him.

388
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:58,028
All right?
You have my permission.

389
00:30:58,235 --> 00:31:00,465
No problem.

390
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:04,364
Come in.

391
00:31:05,342 --> 00:31:07,333
You may unleash the dog.

392
00:31:07,544 --> 00:31:09,978
It's his first day,
better not yet.

393
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,943
Whatever you say.

394
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:16,108
This is where you'll stay.

395
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:19,217
It's a little grimy...

396
00:31:19,423 --> 00:31:22,654
however...
Well, come in.

397
00:31:24,461 --> 00:31:27,521
There's a heater and food.

398
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:31,827
Now help me close
the gate, please.

399
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:25,513
Open up!
The wind's blowing!

400
00:32:35,966 --> 00:32:36,955
Open up!

401
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:40,330
Down, Le Chien!

402
00:32:43,707 --> 00:32:48,235
Down, Le Chien!
Stay down!

403
00:32:48,545 --> 00:32:50,979
Get that dog away from me, pal.

404
00:32:52,516 --> 00:32:57,044
Brother, please.
I'm asking you. Please.

405
00:33:00,524 --> 00:33:02,992
-Are you Galván?
-Yes.

406
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:06,788
I have orders
not to let you in.

407
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:09,261
You'll have to come back to get
your things in the afternoon.

408
00:33:09,466 --> 00:33:12,162
I can't come back
in the afternoon, brother.

409
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:14,667
Those are the orders I have.

410
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,200
It's just a handful of things.

411
00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:21,206
I'll gather them and I'll go.

412
00:33:22,445 --> 00:33:25,676
It won't take more
than ten minutes.

413
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:32,146
Please, I'm asking you.

414
00:33:37,627 --> 00:33:40,323
I'll get everything
in five minutes.

415
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,761
Can you carry all that?

416
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:48,096
I'll get a plastic bag
or something.

417
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:05,349
I have such bad luck!

418
00:34:05,555 --> 00:34:07,887
Such bad luck!

419
00:34:14,297 --> 00:34:17,095
Sorry.

420
00:34:25,175 --> 00:34:26,335
Hey, where are you going?

421
00:34:26,543 --> 00:34:29,011
Galván is inside.
He wants to talk to you.

422
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:31,077
What?

423
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:46,554
You can't go in the bank
with that animal, sir.

424
00:34:46,763 --> 00:34:48,697
It's quick, I'll be in and out.

425
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:51,458
Nothing personal,
but the dog can't go in.

426
00:34:51,768 --> 00:34:54,965
Crap!

427
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:58,206
lf I let him tied over there,
would you keep an eye on him?

428
00:34:58,608 --> 00:35:00,803
I can't.
What if it bites someone?

429
00:35:01,211 --> 00:35:03,270
No, he never bites.

430
00:35:03,813 --> 00:35:05,405
He's a hound, he's tame.

431
00:35:05,615 --> 00:35:08,812
Well, so be it.
But I didn't see anything.

432
00:35:09,285 --> 00:35:10,809
Come on, Le Chien.

433
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:14,420
Come on.
We have to draw some money.

434
00:35:14,624 --> 00:35:15,716
-Good morning, Roque.
-Good morning, sir.

435
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:17,449
You let your headlights turned on.

436
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:21,256
Thanks.
Regulations again.

437
00:35:26,136 --> 00:35:28,661
Excuse me, is this dog yours?

438
00:35:29,406 --> 00:35:31,101
Yes.

439
00:35:31,307 --> 00:35:33,241
-It's a beautiful animal.
-Yes, very beautiful.

440
00:35:33,443 --> 00:35:36,469
-What 's his name?
-Le Chien.

441
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:40,077
May l?

442
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:44,919
Yes, of course.
Touch him.

443
00:35:45,722 --> 00:35:47,383
Could be a fine hound.

444
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,684
-Have you tried him with hogs?
-Not yet.

445
00:35:50,894 --> 00:35:53,590
Could be a fine hound.

446
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:58,733
Because of his bite, you know?

447
00:35:58,935 --> 00:36:01,062
Got one heck of a bite.

448
00:36:01,271 --> 00:36:02,704
Yeah, I think he does.

449
00:36:02,906 --> 00:36:05,136
And he could do fine
on a show too.

450
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:07,536
Can I have a look?

451
00:36:07,744 --> 00:36:10,577
Let 's see.
Nice hind legs.

452
00:36:12,449 --> 00:36:14,280
Beautiful animal.

453
00:36:14,484 --> 00:36:17,612
-Really good, isn't he?
-Yes, it's a fine specimen.

454
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:19,880
You could take him to a show.
Do you have his pedigree?

455
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,081
Yeah, I got it.

456
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:24,692
Why don't you prepare him?

457
00:36:24,894 --> 00:36:27,954
I know someone who could
train him for you.

458
00:36:28,164 --> 00:36:29,188
-Were you going to the bank?
-Yes.

459
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:32,835
-Come, I'll give you the address.
-Okay.

460
00:36:33,503 --> 00:36:35,869
-Sir, your headlights.
-I forgot again.

461
00:36:36,072 --> 00:36:37,334
Please, turn them off for me.

462
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,509
-Of course.
-Thank you. Let 's go.

463
00:36:50,453 --> 00:36:52,421
-You were going to the bank, right?
-Yes.

464
00:36:52,622 --> 00:36:55,785
-What were you going to do?
-I need to cash a check.

465
00:36:55,992 --> 00:36:58,290
-Give it to me, I'll see to it.
-Thank you very much.

466
00:36:58,495 --> 00:36:59,587
-Good morning, Marta.
-Good morning.

467
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:01,263
-Cash this check for me.
-Okay.

468
00:37:01,464 --> 00:37:05,730
Come in, make yourself
comfortable. We'll talk.

469
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:25,277
Well, let's see.

470
00:37:25,488 --> 00:37:28,013
The man I was telling you
about is called Walter Donado.

471
00:37:28,224 --> 00:37:29,623
-Is that so?
-Yes.

472
00:37:29,826 --> 00:37:33,023
He's the best dog wrangler I know.

473
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:36,665
It's just that I don't know anything
about dogs. It 'd be great...

474
00:37:36,866 --> 00:37:41,064
Don't worry, this man's the best.
He lives in Trelew.

475
00:37:41,271 --> 00:37:42,761
I'm looking for his address.

476
00:37:43,973 --> 00:37:48,376
He'll be easy to find,
he's the manager at the racetrack.

477
00:37:48,845 --> 00:37:50,142
Let 's see, here it is.

478
00:37:50,346 --> 00:37:52,837
I'll write his address...

479
00:37:53,049 --> 00:37:55,813
on one of my cards.

480
00:37:56,452 --> 00:38:00,218
Here are his address
and his phone number.

481
00:38:01,257 --> 00:38:04,385
Tell him that Zacarias,
from the Santa Cruz Bank, sent you.

482
00:38:04,594 --> 00:38:06,619
-He owes me a lot of favors.
-Thanks.

483
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,398
While we wait for your money...

484
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,626
take a look at this animal.

485
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:19,539
It was my favorite for years.
Such a big dog!

486
00:38:19,742 --> 00:38:22,074
He fell 300 meters
struggling with a wild hog.

487
00:38:22,278 --> 00:38:25,907
He died, but we had to break
his jaw to pry the hog loose.

488
00:38:26,182 --> 00:38:30,414
Look at this one.
He was gutted by a hog.

489
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,716
We put everything back inside, sewn
him up and he was up and running.

490
00:38:34,924 --> 00:38:37,188
They don't feel pain.

491
00:38:38,728 --> 00:38:41,959
They're totally
insensitive to pain.

492
00:38:42,165 --> 00:38:46,329
You know what?
They're from another planet.

493
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:52,073
-Excuse me.
-Come in.

494
00:38:52,275 --> 00:38:53,469
l brought the money
from the check.

495
00:38:53,676 --> 00:38:55,541
-Is it yours?
-Yes.

496
00:38:55,745 --> 00:38:57,838
I'll need you to sign here.

497
00:38:58,047 --> 00:39:00,845
-Of course.
-Pick up a pen.

498
00:39:01,084 --> 00:39:02,779
Here.

499
00:39:06,856 --> 00:39:09,381
-Here it is.
-You're very kind. Thanks.

500
00:39:09,592 --> 00:39:11,924
-Please count it.
-No need to.

501
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,823
-Thank you, miss.
-Thank you, sir.

502
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:15,621
Very well.

503
00:39:15,832 --> 00:39:18,027
Every month, we go out to hunt
on some friend's grounds.

504
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:22,864
This month's Dr. Recabarren's turn,
down in Laguna Grande.

505
00:39:23,072 --> 00:39:24,903
-Okay.
-My friend, as soon as you can...

506
00:39:25,308 --> 00:39:27,367
just call me and
you'll go with us.

507
00:39:27,577 --> 00:39:29,442
And, of course, bring your dog,
so he'll begin to learn.

508
00:39:29,646 --> 00:39:33,173
I know very little about dogs.
Almost nothing.

509
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:36,375
Don't worry, you'll enjoy it.

510
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:42,919
Yes, on behalf of Zacarias,
accountant at the Santa Cruz Bank.

511
00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:50,190
No, that 's not why I'm calling.
I don't work at the bank.

512
00:39:53,303 --> 00:39:58,400
Well, I've got a dog,
and Mr. Zacarias told me about you.

513
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:04,139
I'd like to know whether
we can do something with the dog.

514
00:40:04,347 --> 00:40:07,214
Yes, the dog's father is called...

515
00:40:08,084 --> 00:40:11,110
Quilo de los Pan.

516
00:40:12,055 --> 00:40:15,752
Quilapán. That 's it.

517
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:20,293
Trelew's racetrack?
Yes, I know it.

518
00:40:20,663 --> 00:40:23,496
Yes, I can be there today.

519
00:40:54,263 --> 00:40:56,823
Wait here, Le Chien.

520
00:41:16,853 --> 00:41:18,912
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

521
00:41:19,122 --> 00:41:22,523
I'm looking for Walter Donado,
the manager.

522
00:41:22,725 --> 00:41:25,785
He's not here.
He went to Trelew to buy some parts.

523
00:41:25,995 --> 00:41:28,395
I'm told he lives around here.

524
00:41:28,598 --> 00:41:30,657
There, right by the office.
I'll show you.

525
00:41:42,712 --> 00:41:44,339
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

526
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:47,539
Excuse me, I'm looking for Walter.

527
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,480
He's not in.
He went to buy some parts.

528
00:41:50,686 --> 00:41:53,382
-Yes, I know.
-But he'll be back soon.

529
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:55,147
Then I'll wait for him here.

530
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:59,192
-Wouldn't you rather come in?
-Won't I disturb you?

531
00:41:59,395 --> 00:42:01,886
-Absolutely not.
-Well, thanks.

532
00:42:02,498 --> 00:42:04,591
Please come in.

533
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:06,735
Come say hi, Mabelita.

534
00:42:06,936 --> 00:42:10,201
Sit down.
Would you care for some tea?

535
00:42:10,406 --> 00:42:12,567
Thank you, ma'am.

536
00:42:14,177 --> 00:42:18,238
Hi, cutie.
Are you studying?

537
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:20,814
Poor thing, she's so nervous
she lost her voice.

538
00:42:21,017 --> 00:42:22,245
Nervous?

539
00:42:22,452 --> 00:42:25,478
It's because she has a presentation
Thursday at City Hall.

540
00:42:25,688 --> 00:42:27,417
That 's why she's like that.

541
00:42:27,623 --> 00:42:29,818
When she was little,
she recited poems like an angel.

542
00:42:30,026 --> 00:42:33,086
Now she gets nervous
and her voice disappears.

543
00:42:33,296 --> 00:42:35,127
Recite it to him, Mabelita.

544
00:42:40,803 --> 00:42:45,900
The dark swallows will come back
To hang their nests on the balcony

545
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:51,069
And again, with their wings
To their crystals...

546
00:42:51,981 --> 00:42:55,940
I don't understand. She gets so
nervous. She knows it by heart.

547
00:42:56,152 --> 00:42:57,915
Come on, Mabelita, slower.

548
00:42:58,121 --> 00:43:01,818
''The dark swallows will
come back...'' Come on.

549
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:06,191
No, not like that,
with a dry throat! We can't hear you.

550
00:43:07,029 --> 00:43:09,293
I can't.

551
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:13,632
See?
That 's how she gets.

552
00:43:14,137 --> 00:43:16,071
-She's nervous.
-Yes.

553
00:43:16,272 --> 00:43:18,900
And I'm tired of that.

554
00:43:20,243 --> 00:43:22,837
My God, what a disgrace.

555
00:43:23,646 --> 00:43:27,013
You don't need to tell me!
I saw him in the car!

556
00:43:27,216 --> 00:43:29,480
You have no idea what kind
of a dog this gentleman has.

557
00:43:29,685 --> 00:43:31,448
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you. Walter Donado.

558
00:43:31,654 --> 00:43:34,919
-You've got pure gold there!
-Did you like him?

559
00:43:35,324 --> 00:43:38,225
Come. Let 's sit down
and go over his papers.

560
00:43:39,862 --> 00:43:42,456
That 's it.

561
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:47,860
You got his vaccinations too.
That 's very important.

562
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,832
Of course! His mother is
Diosa Cristal de los Apóstoles.

563
00:43:54,043 --> 00:43:56,739
Didn't he belong
to that French guy?

564
00:43:57,146 --> 00:43:59,614
Yes, his widow gave him to me.

565
00:43:59,815 --> 00:44:03,717
What are we sitting here for?
Let 's see him right away.

566
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,888
You wanna know?

567
00:44:06,088 --> 00:44:08,886
With this dog well trained,
we're going to make some noise.

568
00:44:09,091 --> 00:44:11,321
You think so?

569
00:44:11,527 --> 00:44:14,291
-Have you thought about selling him?
-I didn't think about it.

570
00:44:14,497 --> 00:44:17,364
What a head you've got!

571
00:44:18,634 --> 00:44:20,534
Wanna do me a favor?

572
00:44:20,736 --> 00:44:23,296
Take me to Gesei's house.
He's president of the Association.

573
00:44:23,506 --> 00:44:24,768
Yeah, let's go.

574
00:44:24,974 --> 00:44:27,408
I want him to see it.

575
00:44:28,277 --> 00:44:31,075
His jaw will drop to the floor!

576
00:44:31,981 --> 00:44:35,974
To exhibit a dog at a show
is not a snobbish thing, Villegas.

577
00:44:36,185 --> 00:44:38,710
It's an art. You gotta choose the
right time to make the dog's debut.

578
00:44:38,921 --> 00:44:41,947
It's like a soccer
player's career.

579
00:44:42,158 --> 00:44:44,991
lf you don't work well on it,
it'll be over soon.

580
00:44:45,194 --> 00:44:48,994
That 's why the dog should be
shown first at small shows...

581
00:44:49,198 --> 00:44:51,962
local ones, and only after that
go to international ones.

582
00:44:52,168 --> 00:44:54,227
I've known about
badly presented dogs...

583
00:44:54,437 --> 00:44:57,031
whose careers were ruined.
And they were great dogs!

584
00:44:58,307 --> 00:45:02,073
That 's why it's important
to build the dog's name.

585
00:45:02,278 --> 00:45:04,746
You need people to know him,
start asking questions.

586
00:45:05,081 --> 00:45:08,050
Then his breeding services
will begin to be sought.

587
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:10,609
lf memory serves,
a week from now...

588
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,685
there's a show in Bahía Blanca.

589
00:45:12,888 --> 00:45:17,222
3 general contests and a grooming
contest. Shall we sign him in?

590
00:45:17,893 --> 00:45:20,088
-A week from now?
-A week!

591
00:45:20,296 --> 00:45:22,389
In a week, with a dog like this...

592
00:45:22,598 --> 00:45:24,031
we can make him perfect!

593
00:45:24,233 --> 00:45:26,997
He needs to stroll,
to learn to raise his head...

594
00:45:27,203 --> 00:45:29,433
...and to stand still.
-You know...

595
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:32,938
...I've never been to a dog show.
-I'll show you what it's like.

596
00:45:33,142 --> 00:45:35,474
When we get back home,
I'll show you on a magazine.

597
00:45:35,678 --> 00:45:38,044
In 1994, we've been in Tampa, USA.

598
00:45:38,247 --> 00:45:40,613
It was a hit!
I'm in one of the pictures.

599
00:45:40,816 --> 00:45:42,841
Remind me to show it to you
when we get back home.

600
00:45:43,052 --> 00:45:46,852
Problem is,
I'm kinda short on money.

601
00:45:47,323 --> 00:45:50,315
I'll tell you what.
I'll prepare the dog...

602
00:45:50,526 --> 00:45:54,053
give you food and lodging,
and we'll split the profits in half.

603
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:56,197
What do you say?

604
00:45:57,433 --> 00:45:58,900
-Well...
-Deal?

605
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:00,966
Deal.

606
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,229
Partners!

607
00:46:15,351 --> 00:46:19,253
-Chip off the old block, isn't he?
-Beautiful.

608
00:46:19,455 --> 00:46:21,719
-He looks fine.
-What do you mean, ''looks fine''?

609
00:46:21,924 --> 00:46:24,722
Must be from the litter of
that female of Rocatagliata.

610
00:46:24,927 --> 00:46:28,021
-Yeah, the one a French guy bought.
-let's get him on the ground...

611
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:29,925
so you can take
a good look at him.

612
00:46:32,768 --> 00:46:35,236
Come on, Le Chien.

613
00:46:35,438 --> 00:46:36,962
Come, Le Chien.

614
00:46:38,407 --> 00:46:40,500
Le Chien, come.

615
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,804
-Ieave him. He'll get down alone.
-Yeah, he always does that.

616
00:46:44,013 --> 00:46:48,279
Come on.
Don't embarrass me.

617
00:46:51,187 --> 00:46:53,587
-He's kinda nervous, right?
-Le Chien, come on.

618
00:46:53,789 --> 00:46:56,223
Careful.

619
00:46:56,792 --> 00:46:59,522
-Jesus!
-Did he bite you?

620
00:46:59,729 --> 00:47:01,720
Just a scratch.

621
00:47:03,265 --> 00:47:04,630
It's okay.

622
00:47:05,067 --> 00:47:06,056
It's nothing.

623
00:47:06,268 --> 00:47:10,136
-You think he's got rabies?
-These dogs don't have rabies.

624
00:47:14,977 --> 00:47:17,377
Looks like this dog
has character.

625
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,377
Our friend has just had
his initiation.

626
00:47:19,582 --> 00:47:22,380
No self-respecting
dogo owner is without scars.

627
00:47:22,585 --> 00:47:25,748
Look, he did that
because he likes you!

628
00:47:25,955 --> 00:47:28,822
Look at this. Compound punctured
fracture pulling two dogs apart.

629
00:47:29,024 --> 00:47:33,654
Radius, elbow and five tendons.
And it wasn't even on purpose!

630
00:47:39,368 --> 00:47:42,303
Welcome to the club, pal.

631
00:47:42,972 --> 00:47:44,667
Okay.

632
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:48,176
Come, Villegas.

633
00:47:48,377 --> 00:47:51,938
Come in, dear Villegas.
I want you to feel at home.

634
00:47:52,581 --> 00:47:55,641
This is never used, except
on Saturdays and Sundays...

635
00:47:55,851 --> 00:47:59,048
when some freak wants to test
his car. 0r when there's a race.

636
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:03,385
Come with me.
I'll put your mattress here.

637
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:07,892
This will be your room.
I'll fix your mattress here.

638
00:48:08,898 --> 00:48:11,765
-let the dog loose.
-Won't he escape?

639
00:48:11,967 --> 00:48:14,265
Here's what I promised you.

640
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,974
You'll see how incredible it is.

641
00:48:20,176 --> 00:48:24,670
Take a look at this.
Tampa, Miami, 1994.

642
00:48:26,215 --> 00:48:28,945
Look at this fantastic show.

643
00:48:30,186 --> 00:48:34,748
This is Argentina's delegation.
See any familiar faces?

644
00:48:34,957 --> 00:48:36,618
Look closely.

645
00:48:36,826 --> 00:48:39,192
-It's you!
-Yes.

646
00:48:39,395 --> 00:48:42,956
There were 60 of us up there.
We almost won the first series.

647
00:48:43,165 --> 00:48:45,292
And you took the dogs there?

648
00:48:45,501 --> 00:48:48,629
Of course! Would we go
to a dog show without dogs?

649
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:50,271
Dumb question!

650
00:48:50,473 --> 00:48:53,237
You can't imagine how much
money flows around this thing.

651
00:48:53,442 --> 00:48:56,502
In the US, there are
80 million dogs...

652
00:48:56,712 --> 00:48:59,476
and they're only
the first minority.

653
00:48:59,682 --> 00:49:01,912
0n top of that, there are still...

654
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:06,414
the sponsors, balanced
dog foods, laboratories...

655
00:49:06,622 --> 00:49:11,491
vaccines, collar manufacturers...
the money behind all that is huge!

656
00:49:11,694 --> 00:49:15,994
I'll tell you more:
when that dog of yours takes off...

657
00:49:16,198 --> 00:49:18,393
we're gonna need a sponsor.

658
00:49:18,601 --> 00:49:21,798
Nowadays, without a sponsor,
you can't do a thing.

659
00:49:22,238 --> 00:49:27,198
But first things first.
First comes Bahía Blanca.

660
00:49:27,409 --> 00:49:30,207
Rest. Tomorrow, early in
the morning, we'll begin training.

661
00:49:30,412 --> 00:49:31,401
-Thanks.
-See you tomorrow.

662
00:49:31,614 --> 00:49:33,411
See you tomorrow.

663
00:49:33,716 --> 00:49:36,378
There's a flashlight. Ten minutes
from now, I'll turn the lights off.

664
00:49:36,585 --> 00:49:38,348
Thank you.

665
00:49:48,531 --> 00:49:49,998
Left, right, left.

666
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:51,598
Left, left.

667
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,563
Left, right, left.

668
00:49:53,769 --> 00:49:56,033
Very good.
We're doing fine, Villegas.

669
00:49:56,305 --> 00:49:57,602
Make him stop, Villegas.

670
00:49:58,641 --> 00:50:00,609
No, Villegas. No.

671
00:50:02,411 --> 00:50:04,003
Turn around.

672
00:50:04,213 --> 00:50:05,646
Stroll him now.

673
00:50:06,849 --> 00:50:08,248
Come on.

674
00:50:10,853 --> 00:50:12,980
Make him turn!

675
00:50:14,123 --> 00:50:15,420
Pull him!

676
00:50:16,792 --> 00:50:20,284
You gotta pull hard, Villegas!
Be firm! Use your strength!

677
00:50:20,496 --> 00:50:23,397
Very important: the head.

678
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,260
Control the leash in your hand.

679
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:29,130
Then, highlight the head. It's the
head we wanna sell, the dog's head.

680
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:32,307
Why a towel?
The wet towel is to clean him up.

681
00:50:32,508 --> 00:50:35,033
That way, the dog goes
to the show brand new.

682
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:36,711
See how this covers it all up?

683
00:50:36,912 --> 00:50:40,939
Hold him tight and keep
some distance.

684
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:43,311
Keep him on a short leash.

685
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,379
You're gonna do fine
in Bahía Blanca.

686
00:50:46,589 --> 00:50:50,081
-You really think so?
-Walter has an eye for these things.

687
00:51:23,959 --> 00:51:27,292
This is the big day, gentlemen!
That 's it!

688
00:51:27,496 --> 00:51:29,157
-What time is it?
-It's 3 in the morning...

689
00:51:29,365 --> 00:51:30,992
but we have
a long day ahead of us.

690
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,294
I borrowed these clothes.

691
00:51:34,503 --> 00:51:38,234
And this cap... is a present.

692
00:51:41,777 --> 00:51:45,736
Come have tea with no sugar
to wake you up, Villegas.

693
00:51:46,415 --> 00:51:47,848
What elegance!

694
00:51:48,283 --> 00:51:52,879
-How do I look?
-You look like an exhibitor.

695
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:57,690
WELC0ME - R0YAL CANIN
GR0WTH AND RESPECT

696
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:12,734
Wait here. I'll check
our position. Stay with him.

697
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:35,796
Good morning.
Are you the dog's owner?

698
00:52:35,998 --> 00:52:38,159
-Yes.
-Here's your pin.

699
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:39,857
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

700
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:42,333
-Bye.
-Bye.

701
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:45,870
Villegas!

702
00:52:46,075 --> 00:52:47,872
Look what I've brought!

703
00:52:48,077 --> 00:52:50,341
The catalog.
Look who's here.

704
00:52:50,546 --> 00:52:52,377
Bombón de Le Chien.

705
00:52:52,948 --> 00:52:54,245
Walter Donado.

706
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:56,414
Juan Villegas.

707
00:52:57,553 --> 00:53:01,580
See the guy in the yellow shirt
brushing a white dog?

708
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:03,052
-You see him?
-Yes.

709
00:53:03,258 --> 00:53:08,696
With that mutt, he won 3 national
and 2 Pan-American championships.

710
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:11,422
Enough money to buy his wife a car...

711
00:53:11,633 --> 00:53:13,965
and make a down payment
on his home.

712
00:53:14,169 --> 00:53:16,296
And all that with
the shit our country is in!

713
00:53:16,505 --> 00:53:19,406
Goes to show what
this dog business is like.

714
00:53:19,808 --> 00:53:22,868
Argentine dogo,
male category...

715
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:26,138
...please, step forward.
-There's our call.

716
00:53:26,348 --> 00:53:29,146
We're ready.
Gotta take him to the circuit.

717
00:53:29,351 --> 00:53:30,943
Come on, champ, knock 'em dead!

718
00:53:31,153 --> 00:53:32,279
-What do I do?
-Show what you can do.

719
00:53:32,488 --> 00:53:34,649
-No, you stay here.
-I stay here?

720
00:53:34,857 --> 00:53:40,159
Watch and learn. We're gonna
bring you the prize. Come on.

721
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:47,826
3RD BAHÍA BLANCA D0G SH0W

722
00:54:19,668 --> 00:54:23,126
Hi, handsome. Are you okay?

723
00:54:23,338 --> 00:54:27,536
That 's it. Good dog.
There's a pal.

724
00:54:31,814 --> 00:54:35,215
Okay. In circles, please.

725
00:54:35,884 --> 00:54:37,749
That way.

726
00:54:38,987 --> 00:54:40,614
Come on, Le Chien.

727
00:54:49,498 --> 00:54:51,796
Very good.
There, behind him.

728
00:54:53,302 --> 00:54:55,361
Secretary, please.

729
00:55:00,776 --> 00:55:02,744
Show the number.

730
00:55:18,727 --> 00:55:19,853
703...

731
00:55:26,368 --> 00:55:31,567
And the winner of the aduIt male
Argentine dogo category is...

732
00:55:32,574 --> 00:55:34,565
You. First place.

733
00:55:40,382 --> 00:55:42,111
Second.

734
00:55:42,317 --> 00:55:43,511
-Third.
-Thanks.

735
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:45,786
What did I tell you?

736
00:55:45,988 --> 00:55:49,583
Moderation. That 's how you
celebrate your first round.

737
00:55:49,791 --> 00:55:51,281
But what did the judge say?

738
00:55:51,493 --> 00:55:53,256
-Was it good?
-What do you think?

739
00:55:53,462 --> 00:55:56,863
We've won the first round
and we're in the finals.

740
00:55:57,065 --> 00:56:02,298
Dear friends, this is the most
anticipated moment in the show.

741
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:07,069
The moment of choosing
the three best dogs...

742
00:56:08,143 --> 00:56:10,543
-What are you doing?
-Here, take him up.

743
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:14,910
Quick, they're calling him!
Do you want to get us disqualified?

744
00:56:15,117 --> 00:56:19,315
Run, run! Go, Le Chien!

745
00:56:24,593 --> 00:56:27,562
Sir! There, sir!

746
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:32,061
Sir! Wait, sir!
You have to stay here.

747
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:37,231
There.

748
00:56:38,507 --> 00:56:40,634
Straighten him up.

749
00:56:46,882 --> 00:56:50,613
Well, the president of our jury...

750
00:56:50,919 --> 00:56:54,184
Mr. Martín Collazo,
is performing...

751
00:56:54,656 --> 00:56:57,056
his customary visual inspection...

752
00:56:57,259 --> 00:56:59,887
of every category's winner...

753
00:57:00,095 --> 00:57:05,123
in our 3rd Bahía Blanca Dog Show.

754
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:06,995
All these...

755
00:57:07,202 --> 00:57:13,835
formidable specimens from
the foremost breeds in our country.

756
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,874
Well, we're close
to the final result.

757
00:57:22,084 --> 00:57:23,073
Let 's decide.

758
00:57:23,285 --> 00:57:28,882
Mr. Collazo and Dr. Renazzi,
secretary in this show...

759
00:57:29,091 --> 00:57:32,254
are going over the last details.

760
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:40,196
The judge is getting the trophies
from his collaborators!

761
00:57:40,402 --> 00:57:42,063
Well, now walk around.

762
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:48,937
Now they perform the traditional
walkaround of the chosen ones.

763
00:57:55,384 --> 00:57:59,980
First prize goes
to the poodle toy...

764
00:58:00,188 --> 00:58:04,989
number 769.

765
00:58:05,794 --> 00:58:10,731
-Second prize goes to...
-Second.

766
00:58:10,932 --> 00:58:12,957
...the Belgian shepherd...

767
00:58:13,168 --> 00:58:18,071
number 767.

768
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,132
-Third prize...
-Third.

769
00:58:20,342 --> 00:58:26,338
...to the Argentine dogo
Bombón de Le Chien...

770
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:30,416
number 703.

771
00:58:33,655 --> 00:58:36,749
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

772
00:58:43,598 --> 00:58:45,691
I knew it! I knew it!

773
00:58:45,901 --> 00:58:49,564
We got third place!
I told you!

774
00:58:50,172 --> 00:58:52,868
And I've already sold
an insemination!

775
00:58:53,075 --> 00:58:55,908
-From the dog?
-Of course! Who could it be from?

776
00:58:56,111 --> 00:58:59,979
We gotta call this guy tomorrow.
He's got a female in heat.

777
00:59:00,182 --> 00:59:03,151
-Great!
-We can charge him some 600 pesos.

778
00:59:03,351 --> 00:59:06,115
Without blinking.

779
00:59:09,524 --> 00:59:13,290
Yes, 600. People in this business
know he's worth that much.

780
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:18,996
I don't know what kind of a dog
could do the job for 400 pesos.

781
00:59:21,303 --> 00:59:24,101
We can offer you a discount.

782
00:59:24,306 --> 00:59:25,864
500.

783
00:59:29,878 --> 00:59:32,506
450. That 's my last offer.

784
00:59:34,716 --> 00:59:37,207
I've got everything.
Even his brucellosis test.

785
00:59:37,419 --> 00:59:41,082
It's a healthy animal.
Don't worry, he's got it all.

786
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:43,424
Yes.

787
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:45,149
-Here's your order.
-Don't worry.

788
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,386
Tomorrow we'll be there.
I've got the address.

789
00:59:48,663 --> 00:59:50,927
Well, see you tomorrow.

790
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:55,903
-Okay. How much?
-7.50.

791
00:59:56,104 --> 00:59:59,471
-Put it on our tab.
-No, you gotta pay cash.

792
00:59:59,908 --> 01:00:04,607
What do you mean?
In Miami, we never had to pay cash.

793
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,110
What 's going on here?

794
01:00:11,186 --> 01:00:12,619
Give him eight pesos.
He can keep the change.

795
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:14,482
I've got it.

796
01:00:16,725 --> 01:00:19,091
Let 's make a toast...

797
01:00:19,895 --> 01:00:21,988
to the future.

798
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:26,957
To this partnership,
born to be a success!

799
01:00:27,169 --> 01:00:29,194
And also to Le Chien.

800
01:00:32,107 --> 01:00:34,507
To Le Chien!

801
01:01:03,505 --> 01:01:05,166
Do you like that chubby girl?

802
01:01:05,974 --> 01:01:07,635
She sings fine.

803
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:11,675
Yeah, sure.

804
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,077
She reminds me of a girlfriend
I had 30 years ago.

805
01:01:15,283 --> 01:01:17,615
-Could it be her?
-I don't think so.

806
01:01:29,164 --> 01:01:32,065
I'll bring her over
so you can make sure.

807
01:01:46,014 --> 01:01:49,848
-This is Coco Villegas.
-Nice to meet you. Susana.

808
01:01:50,051 --> 01:01:53,487
He's the most important
dog breeder in Patagônia.

809
01:01:53,688 --> 01:01:56,816
One of his dogs just won
first prize in Bahía Blanca.

810
01:01:57,025 --> 01:01:59,789
-How nice! Congratulations.
-Thank you.

811
01:01:59,995 --> 01:02:03,761
The dog should be congratulated
too, but they wouldn't let him in.

812
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:06,224
-Do you want some cider?
-Yes.

813
01:02:06,434 --> 01:02:08,732
Waiter, a cider, please!

814
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:10,871
Your work is
interesting, isn't it?

815
01:02:11,072 --> 01:02:14,803
You're always traveling
and going to dog shows.

816
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:17,478
Well, actually, he's the one
doing most of the traveling.

817
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:21,547
Sometimes, we need
to take a dog to the US.

818
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,342
How nice.

819
01:02:23,551 --> 01:02:25,178
It's a very important business.

820
01:02:25,387 --> 01:02:29,050
There are 80 million dogs in
the US. They're the first minority.

821
01:02:29,257 --> 01:02:34,217
-Must be very thrilling.
-No, no. Pour it here.

822
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:37,594
Well, let's ask for
a moment of silence.

823
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:41,098
Let 's make a toast, shall we?

824
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:46,298
I'd like to ask for silence
and propose a toast...

825
01:02:46,508 --> 01:02:49,966
because we have here the owner
of the best dog, who has just won...

826
01:02:50,178 --> 01:02:55,480
the Bahía Blanca Dog Show:
Mr. Coco Villegas!

827
01:03:02,357 --> 01:03:07,727
And also to Le Chien, the best dog,
who they didn't allow in here!

828
01:03:45,967 --> 01:03:47,867
You sing very nicely.

829
01:03:48,069 --> 01:03:49,696
-I thought you were Arabic.
-No.

830
01:03:49,904 --> 01:03:52,498
When I was a child, I worked for a
Lebanese man who owned a store...

831
01:03:52,707 --> 01:03:56,939
...and I always heard this song.
-Must be difficult.

832
01:03:57,512 --> 01:03:59,139
Not when you like to sing.

833
01:03:59,347 --> 01:04:01,542
I mean, it must be
difficuIt to understand.

834
01:04:01,983 --> 01:04:03,848
I wouldn't know.
I sing it phonetically.

835
01:04:04,052 --> 01:04:06,213
I don't really understand,
but I always check first...

836
01:04:06,421 --> 01:04:09,788
that there aren't any foul words.
This is a family place.

837
01:04:14,062 --> 01:04:15,290
Go, fatso!

838
01:04:19,768 --> 01:04:21,736
Cognac and a show for everyone!

839
01:04:24,305 --> 01:04:26,136
Give her money,
you fat cheapskate!

840
01:04:33,214 --> 01:04:34,977
Okay, who's the asshole?

841
01:04:46,127 --> 01:04:48,891
You like to throw bread around?

842
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:53,361
-Stop, it, fatso!
-Enough!

843
01:04:53,568 --> 01:04:57,470
Get outta here, you idiots!
Out!

844
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:05,970
Don't worry.

845
01:05:06,181 --> 01:05:08,911
They'll hold him at the police
station just for a few hours.

846
01:05:09,117 --> 01:05:11,517
Tomorrow he'll
be released, surely.

847
01:05:12,253 --> 01:05:15,620
At these parties, there's always
someone who drinks too much.

848
01:05:16,925 --> 01:05:19,917
-It was this one who won the prize?
-Yes.

849
01:05:20,128 --> 01:05:21,527
He's very handsome.

850
01:05:21,729 --> 01:05:24,892
I had a little dog when
I was living in Buenos Aires.

851
01:05:25,099 --> 01:05:28,762
-A Pomeranian.
-Did you live in Buenos Aires?

852
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:32,770
I've lived there for two years.
I sang at the Horizonte Club.

853
01:05:33,341 --> 01:05:36,606
It was a Syrian-Iebanese club,
but it was a posh place.

854
01:05:36,945 --> 01:05:39,436
Its patrons were very wealthy.

855
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:45,943
We're close.
It's five blocks from here.

856
01:05:47,121 --> 01:05:51,217
Whenever you want to throw a party,
call me. I'll organize it for you.

857
01:05:51,426 --> 01:05:53,860
Shayla is my trade name.

858
01:05:54,062 --> 01:05:58,226
I'll hire the musicians, everything.
Even a dancer, if you want.

859
01:06:01,603 --> 01:06:03,093
Let 's have a coffee.

860
01:06:03,304 --> 01:06:06,296
I don't want to disturb you.
It's very late.

861
01:06:06,508 --> 01:06:08,738
Disturb me?
You brought me all the way here.

862
01:06:08,943 --> 01:06:11,411
Have a coffee,
then you can go back.

863
01:06:14,015 --> 01:06:15,778
Come in.

864
01:06:16,818 --> 01:06:19,787
-Allow me.
-Make yourself at home.

865
01:06:20,255 --> 01:06:24,055
I'll brew the hot coffee
I promised you.

866
01:06:24,259 --> 01:06:25,248
Thank you.

867
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:29,897
-Do you like Turkish coffee?
-Well... today's Turkish food day.

868
01:06:33,034 --> 01:06:37,130
My dad built this house some months
before he got married to my mom.

869
01:06:37,338 --> 01:06:40,569
-It looks well preserved.
-Not exactly.

870
01:06:40,775 --> 01:06:45,439
I need to fix the roof, there are
some leaks. What are we to do?

871
01:06:46,047 --> 01:06:48,072
You make the Turkish
coffee in here.

872
01:06:48,283 --> 01:06:52,583
In this pot. Look, copper on the
outside and pewter on the inside.

873
01:06:54,455 --> 01:06:57,356
-Careful, it's hot.
-Thanks.

874
01:07:05,934 --> 01:07:09,426
-Something's left on your tongue?
-Yes.

875
01:07:09,637 --> 01:07:14,199
It's the dregs. When you finish
drinking it, it'll be in the cup.

876
01:07:19,047 --> 01:07:21,072
Do you want me to read them?

877
01:07:21,282 --> 01:07:24,809
-Read them?
-Yes, you can read coffee dregs.

878
01:07:26,254 --> 01:07:28,745
Really.
They tell about your future.

879
01:07:30,358 --> 01:07:32,690
-Okay.
-I'll tell you how it's done.

880
01:07:32,894 --> 01:07:35,362
You put the cup here.

881
01:07:35,563 --> 01:07:38,760
Cover it.
Now turn it upside down.

882
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:41,834
-Turn it?
-Yes. Keep it here.

883
01:07:44,372 --> 01:07:46,966
Leave it on the table.

884
01:07:47,175 --> 01:07:49,006
That 's it.

885
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:05,416
Now lift it carefully.

886
01:08:06,127 --> 01:08:08,527
That 's it.

887
01:08:14,369 --> 01:08:16,360
You fooled me.

888
01:08:17,739 --> 01:08:20,003
You are the one who travels a lot.

889
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:23,336
-And you'll keep on traveling.
-Really? Are you sure?

890
01:08:23,544 --> 01:08:26,035
Yes, I can see a big trip here.

891
01:08:26,247 --> 01:08:29,114
To buy a farm.
Is that possible?

892
01:08:31,185 --> 01:08:32,652
0r a bit of land.

893
01:08:34,255 --> 01:08:36,416
A little bit of land?

894
01:08:36,624 --> 01:08:39,058
Yes, could be a little bit.

895
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:41,754
-There are nice places around here.
-Really?

896
01:08:41,963 --> 01:08:44,523
lf you want, I can show you.

897
01:08:53,775 --> 01:08:55,709
He's got a clean record.

898
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:59,004
Chief gets here only in the morning.
Nothing can be done until then.

899
01:08:59,213 --> 01:09:04,310
He got a bit carried away,
but he's a nice guy.

900
01:09:04,519 --> 01:09:07,215
Then I'd advise him
to get a grip.

901
01:09:07,422 --> 01:09:09,913
-You want to see him?
-If it's possible, yes.

902
01:09:10,758 --> 01:09:13,750
Come with me.

903
01:09:17,765 --> 01:09:20,165
-There he is.
-Ask him who started it!

904
01:09:20,368 --> 01:09:22,928
-Ask him who threw bread around.
-Are you crazy?

905
01:09:23,137 --> 01:09:25,037
What difference does
it make who threw bread?

906
01:09:25,239 --> 01:09:29,471
I was dancing, I wasn't bothering
a soul, and all of a sudden...

907
01:09:29,677 --> 01:09:34,410
somebody threw bread at me.
Not just a bit, a whole bun!

908
01:09:35,383 --> 01:09:39,012
-Only five minutes.
-Thanks.

909
01:09:42,256 --> 01:09:43,917
Listen.

910
01:09:44,892 --> 01:09:50,125
Take the dog to this Pascual guy.
To do the job.

911
01:09:50,331 --> 01:09:52,663
-You got his phone number?
-No.

912
01:09:54,469 --> 01:09:55,527
Here.

913
01:09:56,404 --> 01:09:58,770
Make him sign
the work order first.

914
01:09:58,973 --> 01:10:03,740
The dog shouldn't mount her
without him signing first.

915
01:10:03,945 --> 01:10:07,312
I know this business.
It's full of wiseguys.

916
01:10:32,874 --> 01:10:35,308
-Yes?
-Mr. Pascual?

917
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:37,501
You're a bit early.

918
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,274
Well, come in.

919
01:10:43,718 --> 01:10:47,484
In here. I've already taken
Pamela's temperature.

920
01:10:47,688 --> 01:10:48,985
She's almost ready.

921
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:51,556
Have you brought his papers,
vaccinations, test results?

922
01:10:51,759 --> 01:10:54,421
Yes, it's everything here.

923
01:10:57,064 --> 01:10:58,531
Sit down.

924
01:11:10,912 --> 01:11:12,903
Bombón de Le Chien.
Is that the dog's name?

925
01:11:13,114 --> 01:11:15,082
No, Le Chien.

926
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:19,447
''Bombón de Le Chien''.
Le Chien is the kennel.

927
01:11:22,557 --> 01:11:25,890
Who in the world
would name a dog Bombón?

928
01:11:29,997 --> 01:11:33,296
Well, I'll take Pamela's
temperature again.

929
01:11:35,303 --> 01:11:38,204
The big guy said
you had a lot of dogs.

930
01:11:38,406 --> 01:11:40,670
He told me you were
expanding your kennel.

931
01:11:40,908 --> 01:11:42,500
Well, as a matter of fact, we are.

932
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:45,873
Wait a minute.
I'll be right back.

933
01:11:55,256 --> 01:11:58,089
Pamela, come here!

934
01:11:58,893 --> 01:12:01,088
It's a thermometer!

935
01:12:02,763 --> 01:12:05,061
Come on, Pamela, come out!

936
01:12:05,533 --> 01:12:10,027
Come on, out!
It's only a thermometer!

937
01:12:12,206 --> 01:12:16,040
-It's time to introduce them.
-Come, Le Chien.

938
01:12:23,384 --> 01:12:26,444
I hope he likes his bride.

939
01:12:28,856 --> 01:12:32,849
-It's her first time. What about him?
-I think it's his first time too.

940
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:36,052
What do you mean? The fat guy
told me he was experienced.

941
01:12:36,264 --> 01:12:39,290
Well, then, it must be true.

942
01:12:39,834 --> 01:12:43,133
-That fat guy is a crook.
-No, he knows his business.

943
01:12:43,337 --> 01:12:45,066
In you go.

944
01:13:24,045 --> 01:13:26,343
See?
Told ya.

945
01:13:27,815 --> 01:13:30,181
Now we have a problem.

946
01:13:35,723 --> 01:13:39,887
Let 's leave them alone to see
if they understand each other.

947
01:13:40,628 --> 01:13:43,188
Nature is wise. Come.

948
01:13:53,507 --> 01:13:56,999
That dog is a coward!
He won't even come out!

949
01:13:57,211 --> 01:14:00,544
I'll miss her heat.
I'll have to wait six months more.

950
01:14:00,748 --> 01:14:05,515
Who's gonna pay for her food and
my lost profit? Who? You guys?

951
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,689
Why the hell did I do
business with you?

952
01:14:08,889 --> 01:14:11,653
Now I know why he's called Bombón!

953
01:14:11,859 --> 01:14:16,228
And I had her already fixed with
a three-year-old male, a stud!

954
01:14:17,531 --> 01:14:20,466
Where am I gonna find
a male now?

955
01:14:20,668 --> 01:14:23,432
Curse the moment I let
that tub of lard convince me!

956
01:14:23,637 --> 01:14:25,502
Where the heck is that fatso?!

957
01:14:30,578 --> 01:14:32,671
How did it go?

958
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,077
So-so.
The dog got scared.

959
01:14:36,884 --> 01:14:39,648
-Scared? What happened?
-I don't know.

960
01:14:39,854 --> 01:14:42,948
-The dog couldn't do it.
-What do you mean?

961
01:14:43,157 --> 01:14:45,250
He just laid there and
didn't want to do anything.

962
01:14:45,459 --> 01:14:47,791
You should have helped him.
The dog doesn't know.

963
01:14:47,995 --> 01:14:50,759
Besides, the guy got mad.

964
01:14:50,965 --> 01:14:53,934
What a jerk! The dog doesn't know,
you need to help him.

965
01:14:54,135 --> 01:14:57,468
-They're just like teenagers.
-What do we do now?

966
01:14:57,671 --> 01:15:01,198
We look for an experienced
female to teach him.

967
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:05,502
For instance, didn't anybody
help you in your first time?

968
01:15:08,482 --> 01:15:12,043
-What will we do if he can't do it?
-Of course he can!

969
01:15:13,354 --> 01:15:15,845
Our business is
dog reproduction.

970
01:15:16,057 --> 01:15:19,424
We get them busy and we produce
them. It's just like a factory.

971
01:15:20,795 --> 01:15:25,255
Here it is. El Entrevero.
Stop when you see a payphone.

972
01:15:25,466 --> 01:15:28,993
Last year, this guy had
some fantastic females.

973
01:15:38,245 --> 01:15:42,181
Wait here.
I'll call Omar and I'll be right back.

974
01:15:47,721 --> 01:15:49,484
-Hi there.
-Good afternoon.

975
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:51,783
-How do you do?
-Fine, and you?

976
01:15:51,992 --> 01:15:55,587
Same old, same old.
Did they close your gas station?

977
01:15:55,796 --> 01:15:58,390
Yes, a while ago...

978
01:15:58,732 --> 01:16:01,633
...and I got fired.
-You're at another gas station now?

979
01:16:01,836 --> 01:16:03,565
No, I've changed professions.

980
01:16:03,771 --> 01:16:06,569
-You've changed professions?
-I'm a dog breeder now.

981
01:16:06,774 --> 01:16:07,763
I'm an exhibitor.

982
01:16:08,275 --> 01:16:10,869
-A dog exhibitor?
-Yes.

983
01:16:11,078 --> 01:16:13,911
-Who would have thought it?
-I've got one right here.

984
01:16:14,115 --> 01:16:15,673
Beautiful animal.

985
01:16:16,217 --> 01:16:18,014
Very well groomed.

986
01:16:18,853 --> 01:16:22,118
-Quiet, Le Chien! Down!
-Holy shit!

987
01:16:22,556 --> 01:16:24,080
I need a dog just like this one.

988
01:16:24,391 --> 01:16:26,586
We get about three
burglaries a month here.

989
01:16:26,794 --> 01:16:28,989
Would you have a dog
like this to sell me?

990
01:16:29,196 --> 01:16:32,927
In the future. Soon.

991
01:16:33,134 --> 01:16:36,399
Save a puppy for me.
I want a male.

992
01:16:37,304 --> 01:16:39,966
-See you.
-Okay. Don't you forget.

993
01:16:40,774 --> 01:16:43,106
Well, everything is settled.

994
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:46,404
I've just spoken to Omar.
He's got a bitch in heat.

995
01:16:46,614 --> 01:16:49,708
She's perfect, because
she's old and experienced.

996
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:52,215
She went through two heats
without being mounted.

997
01:16:52,419 --> 01:16:55,582
He's gonna impregnate her
just by looking at her!

998
01:16:55,789 --> 01:16:58,952
What dog was that guy
talking about?

999
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,890
-He wants a puppy from this one.
-What did I tell you?

1000
01:17:02,096 --> 01:17:06,226
They sell just like hot cakes. And
after he develops a taste for it...

1001
01:17:12,606 --> 01:17:16,804
She doesn't have a pedigree,
but she's fine. I guarantee it.

1002
01:17:17,011 --> 01:17:19,605
Old and without a pedigree?
Then you'll have to pay me.

1003
01:17:19,813 --> 01:17:24,773
No, buddy. lf your dog doesn't learn
with her, you may as well give up.

1004
01:17:25,419 --> 01:17:29,446
-Carmelo, is Malena in heat?
-Her heat has just started.

1005
01:17:29,657 --> 01:17:33,718
Bring her. Pamela is her daughter.
lf he doesn't learn with both...

1006
01:17:33,928 --> 01:17:37,955
-What a party for you, you big lug!
-Carmelo, bring her here.

1007
01:17:38,165 --> 01:17:42,226
Help me, Villegas. Release him,
he's going crazy already.

1008
01:17:42,436 --> 01:17:46,304
He's going nuts.
Go, Le Chien! Attaboy!

1009
01:17:50,144 --> 01:17:52,908
Let 's see this female.

1010
01:17:53,814 --> 01:17:59,252
Look, Le Chien is mad.

1011
01:17:59,453 --> 01:18:00,943
Go, Le Chien!

1012
01:18:01,155 --> 01:18:03,248
That 's it!

1013
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:10,960
-He went inside.
-Well, this is a new breed.

1014
01:18:11,165 --> 01:18:13,725
There's something
wrong with this dog.

1015
01:18:13,934 --> 01:18:17,426
Must've been traumatized because
his owner died when he was a puppy.

1016
01:18:17,805 --> 01:18:21,764
Let 's help him mount so he'll
understand how the thing works.

1017
01:18:22,142 --> 01:18:25,407
-I don't get it.
-He just needs a hand.

1018
01:18:27,581 --> 01:18:29,947
I'll help you.

1019
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:33,911
Come on, Le Chien!

1020
01:18:34,121 --> 01:18:35,884
What 's his problem?

1021
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:38,089
Come on!

1022
01:18:38,292 --> 01:18:39,816
With him, nothing happens.

1023
01:18:40,427 --> 01:18:42,019
That 's impossible. Come on!

1024
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:44,993
We're gonna have to use
artificial insemination.

1025
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:46,928
That 's for wealthy dogs.

1026
01:18:47,134 --> 01:18:48,863
Everybody will laugh at me
at the Association.

1027
01:18:49,069 --> 01:18:52,903
Looks like you'll have
a dog just for show.

1028
01:18:53,107 --> 01:18:56,099
Come on, Le Chien!

1029
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:57,299
What 's his problem?

1030
01:18:57,745 --> 01:18:59,576
He's a beautiful specimen.

1031
01:19:00,047 --> 01:19:02,914
The only problem is his libido.

1032
01:19:03,617 --> 01:19:05,278
He hasn't got one.

1033
01:19:05,486 --> 01:19:07,750
I've had similar cases...

1034
01:19:07,955 --> 01:19:10,753
but this one is extreme.

1035
01:19:11,058 --> 01:19:16,394
You need to remember
that he's already an adult.

1036
01:19:17,264 --> 01:19:20,700
What about the celery
treatment, the...?

1037
01:19:21,235 --> 01:19:25,797
No, those things...
they're like...

1038
01:19:26,006 --> 01:19:29,442
Those are Chinese folktales.
You can't trust them.

1039
01:19:29,643 --> 01:19:32,476
However, he's a
wonderful specimen...

1040
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,080
with a great character.

1041
01:19:35,282 --> 01:19:37,113
He's got a lot going for him.

1042
01:19:37,318 --> 01:19:40,014
He can be trained to do
a lot of things...

1043
01:19:40,521 --> 01:19:43,456
like bringing your newspaper.

1044
01:19:44,758 --> 01:19:48,455
He's a very docile dog.
He'll be fine at home.

1045
01:19:49,129 --> 01:19:53,498
That guy may be a vet
or whatever...

1046
01:19:53,701 --> 01:19:56,431
but this dog's gonna
surprise us at any moment.

1047
01:19:57,304 --> 01:20:00,000
Things that happen
in the animal business.

1048
01:20:01,642 --> 01:20:06,011
Look, Villegas, stay here
in Bahía Blanca. Find a job.

1049
01:20:06,213 --> 01:20:08,272
You're a mechanic, man.

1050
01:20:08,482 --> 01:20:12,782
Don't worry about the dog. I'll take
care of him for a few weeks.

1051
01:20:12,986 --> 01:20:15,454
I won't even charge you for that.

1052
01:20:28,369 --> 01:20:30,394
What 's wrong, Villegas?

1053
01:20:31,538 --> 01:20:33,529
Can't you keep in touch by phone?

1054
01:20:33,741 --> 01:20:37,575
When you're all nice and settled,
you can take him with you.

1055
01:20:38,212 --> 01:20:41,409
Relax. You know
I'll take good care of him.

1056
01:20:47,721 --> 01:20:49,586
I almost forgot!

1057
01:20:50,257 --> 01:20:55,923
I paid to sign him in
at the show. 25 pesos.

1058
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:59,190
Keep the receipt.
It's a record, anyway.

1059
01:21:05,139 --> 01:21:07,198
-Here.
-Thanks.

1060
01:21:17,684 --> 01:21:20,482
TOURIST CENTER
''LAS TONINAS''

1061
01:21:24,691 --> 01:21:26,852
Here comes the bus, Villegas.

1062
01:21:38,739 --> 01:21:40,730
-Can you open it down here?
-Is it a dog?

1063
01:21:40,941 --> 01:21:43,136
He's used to traveling.

1064
01:22:00,761 --> 01:22:03,662
Behave, Le Chien.

1065
01:22:03,864 --> 01:22:05,593
You can close now.

1066
01:22:08,435 --> 01:22:10,198
Don't worry,
I'll take care of him.

1067
01:22:10,404 --> 01:22:13,305
-Okay, thanks.
-As soon as you're settled, call me.

1068
01:22:13,507 --> 01:22:16,032
-Of course.
-Bye.

1069
01:22:52,112 --> 01:22:54,706
-Good morning.
-Hi.

1070
01:22:54,915 --> 01:22:58,612
-Do you have a payphone here?
-No, we don't have one.

1071
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,157
-How much for these alfajors?
-Seis pesos.

1072
01:23:13,133 --> 01:23:14,760
Here.

1073
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,019
I brought it for you.

1074
01:23:42,963 --> 01:23:45,523
I can't accept this.

1075
01:23:46,199 --> 01:23:49,566
You must have worked
very hard to make it.

1076
01:23:50,904 --> 01:23:52,804
It doesn't matter.

1077
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,867
-All right.
-You can use it in the kitchen.

1078
01:23:58,278 --> 01:24:01,042
But it's not a kitchen knife!

1079
01:24:01,248 --> 01:24:05,048
0r you can just keep it.

1080
01:24:05,452 --> 01:24:07,181
Well, thanks.

1081
01:24:07,821 --> 01:24:10,289
I'll keep it dearly.

1082
01:24:11,058 --> 01:24:12,855
Looks like...
It's a cat, isn't it?

1083
01:24:13,527 --> 01:24:16,121
-Right?
-It's a puma.

1084
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:19,197
-Yes, a puma.
-A puma.

1085
01:24:22,235 --> 01:24:23,862
What about the dog?

1086
01:24:25,005 --> 01:24:28,736
Walter kept him.
Walter, the fat guy.

1087
01:24:28,942 --> 01:24:31,433
He's got space at his place.

1088
01:24:32,179 --> 01:24:34,113
I just love dogs.

1089
01:24:34,314 --> 01:24:38,683
But it's hard to travel around
bringing dogs along.

1090
01:24:38,885 --> 01:24:41,547
I told you about the dog
I had in Buenos Aires, didn't l?

1091
01:24:42,155 --> 01:24:47,491
When my father got sick, I came
here, and I left her with a friend.

1092
01:24:47,694 --> 01:24:50,959
Then I was told she got sad and...

1093
01:24:51,164 --> 01:24:53,530
she died soon after that.

1094
01:24:55,402 --> 01:24:58,337
We get used to their company.

1095
01:24:59,439 --> 01:25:02,340
It's just like two people
who are in love.

1096
01:25:03,076 --> 01:25:06,307
We never notice we care
so much for someone...

1097
01:25:06,513 --> 01:25:08,378
until they go away.

1098
01:25:43,483 --> 01:25:45,417
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1099
01:25:45,619 --> 01:25:47,917
-How are you, ma'am?
-I'm fine.

1100
01:25:49,089 --> 01:25:50,784
Walter?

1101
01:25:50,991 --> 01:25:53,926
Every time you come here,
Walter isn't home.

1102
01:25:56,196 --> 01:26:00,496
He's awfully busy, because
there's a race this Sunday.

1103
01:26:01,968 --> 01:26:04,937
-You came for the dog?
-Yes.

1104
01:26:05,138 --> 01:26:08,437
Walter wanted to call you, but he
didn't know where to reach you.

1105
01:26:09,443 --> 01:26:11,308
The dog's escaped.

1106
01:26:15,949 --> 01:26:17,849
What do you mean, escaped?

1107
01:26:18,051 --> 01:26:20,042
He must have escaped really early.

1108
01:26:20,253 --> 01:26:24,622
About 5 AM. I got up at 8
and he was already gone.

1109
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:35,857
Poor Walter.
He was so worried.

1110
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:14,504
-Hi.
-Hi, mister.

1111
01:27:14,708 --> 01:27:19,145
Have you seen the white dog
Walter, the manager, had?

1112
01:27:19,346 --> 01:27:22,144
I saw him a few days ago,
when he was training it.

1113
01:27:22,349 --> 01:27:26,080
-Haven't you seen the dog today?
-No, not today.

1114
01:27:26,286 --> 01:27:29,119
-It's a nice dog, isn't it?
-Yes.

1115
01:27:29,956 --> 01:27:32,720
-What breed is it?
-Dogo.

1116
01:27:32,926 --> 01:27:34,894
Maybe it was stolen, chief.

1117
01:27:38,165 --> 01:27:40,895
Watch out for the people
who live in El Progreso, chief.

1118
01:27:41,101 --> 01:27:43,535
People there are kinda dangerous.

1119
01:27:44,471 --> 01:27:48,032
I heard they eat dogs there.

1120
01:28:30,817 --> 01:28:34,685
Kid, have you seen a huge
white dog around here?

1121
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:16,088
Have you seen a huge white dog?

1122
01:29:16,296 --> 01:29:17,354
No.

1123
01:29:17,864 --> 01:29:19,422
Not here.

1124
01:29:19,633 --> 01:29:22,898
Look for it near
the brick factory.

1125
01:29:23,403 --> 01:29:24,995
-The brick factory?
-Yes.

1126
01:29:26,306 --> 01:29:29,503
-Where that smoke's coming from?
-Yes, around there.

1127
01:29:29,709 --> 01:29:31,404
Thanks.

1128
01:30:08,381 --> 01:30:11,908
Hi. I'm looking for
a big white dog.

1129
01:30:12,118 --> 01:30:15,781
-I've seen him there.
-Well, thanks.

1130
01:30:42,983 --> 01:30:44,712
Bombón!

1131
01:30:45,318 --> 01:30:46,444
Bombón?

1132
01:30:55,261 --> 01:30:57,991
Have you seen
a white dog around?

1133
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:03,196
He must be behind those bricks.

1134
01:31:04,037 --> 01:31:05,504
-That way?
-Behind those piles of bricks.

1135
01:31:05,705 --> 01:31:07,138
Thanks.

1136
01:31:28,261 --> 01:31:29,353
Le Chien!

1137
01:31:36,903 --> 01:31:38,200
Bombón, here!

1138
01:31:44,844 --> 01:31:46,505
Le Chien?

1139
01:31:51,551 --> 01:31:53,143
Bombón!

1140
01:32:56,616 --> 01:32:57,981
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1141
01:32:58,184 --> 01:33:00,812
-Are you going to Viedma?
-No, to Bahía Blanca.

1142
01:33:01,054 --> 01:33:03,887
-Could you give us a ride?
-Of course. Hop in.

1143
01:33:04,090 --> 01:33:05,717
I'll put the dog in the back.

1144
01:33:05,925 --> 01:33:08,553
-Doesn't he bite?
-No, he doesn't do anything.

1145
01:33:08,761 --> 01:33:10,729
Thank you, sir.

1146
01:33:11,798 --> 01:33:14,266
Are you gonna stay long
in Buenos Aires?

1147
01:33:14,467 --> 01:33:16,435
We hope so.
We don't know.

1148
01:33:16,636 --> 01:33:18,536
We're going because
there are more jobs there.

1149
01:33:18,738 --> 01:33:21,832
We're gonna try our luck.

1150
01:33:22,375 --> 01:33:25,344
-Have you been there before?
-No. You?

1151
01:33:25,545 --> 01:33:26,739
No.

1152
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:29,947
I've never been there, and now...

1153
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:32,118
What do you do?

1154
01:33:32,318 --> 01:33:34,513
-I'm a dog breeder.
-How nice!

1155
01:33:34,721 --> 01:33:36,518
I'm an exhibitor.

1156
01:33:36,723 --> 01:33:38,884
What does an exhibitor do?

1157
01:33:40,293 --> 01:33:42,090
Takes his dogs to dog shows.

1158
01:33:42,295 --> 01:33:45,093
The prizes are really great.

1159
01:33:45,298 --> 01:33:46,959
Have you got a lot of them?

1160
01:33:47,167 --> 01:33:49,465
Right now, I've only got this one.

1161
01:33:49,669 --> 01:33:53,537
But we'll see if things
get better in the future.

1162
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:57,267
No, I was asking whether
you have a lot of prizes.

1163
01:33:57,477 --> 01:33:59,468
Yeah, I've got some.

1164
01:34:00,713 --> 01:34:03,477
-But not many yet.
-Okay.
