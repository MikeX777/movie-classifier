7
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,559
What's the matter with Yisrael?
He overslept.

8
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,438
I don't know, he always wakes
the neighborhood up on time.

10
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,434
Pull!

11
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,811
Pull.
- Be careful not to fall.

12
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,646
Don't worry,
Baruch.

13
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,488
Yisrael the Indian is arriving.
- He's late today.

14
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,615
Yisrael,
you asshole!

15
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,075
You're 10 minutes late.

16
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,453
I should be the alarm clock...

17
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,288
You? You'll have us
sleeping till noon.

18
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,040
No way.
I'm precise as a Swiss watch.

19
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,750
Yeah, sure...

20
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,629
Come down already.
It's getting hot here.

Producers:
Amir Harel & Haim Manor

22
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,027
All together now...

Director:
Benni Torati

24
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,494
It weighs a ton...

25
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,879
Did you speak to the synagogue
about the memorial service?

26
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,465
Everything's arranged, Mom.

27
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,094
How about the notices?

28
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,098
Yisrael plastered notices
all over the neighborhood.

29
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,165
Nissim.

30
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,167
Nissim!

31
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,882
I had a dream about Dad,
blew my mind.

32
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,428
I saw Dad standing
in front of the old theater.

33
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,849
You and Aaron were there too.

34
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,185
The whole neighborhood
was gathered around.

35
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,980
Dad was nailing the door
of the theater shut.

36
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,066
Everyone was crying
like little children.

37
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,485
Quite a dream.
- There's even more to it.

38
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,907
Then Dad tries to pry loose
the boards nailed to the door

39
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,325
but he doesn't have the strength.

40
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,329
He grabs me by the collar,
like this... Like this.

41
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,748
He asks me to help him.

42
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,876
But my arms are weak
and the boards won't budge.

43
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,088
Then Dad, with tears
in his eyes,

44
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,757
makes me promise I'll do
one final screening

45
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,634
to undo the vow.

46
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,469
A vow is no laughing matter, Nissim.

47
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,639
I'll tell you his exact words:

48
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,309
"Screen one last movie
to undo the vow."

49
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,522
"Memorial service -
Morris Mandebon"

50
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,625
How are you, Yisrael?

51
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,921
Avram?

52
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,486
Seniora.

53
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,074
You won't believe it.
Avram is back.

54
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,035
Avram? Which Avram?

55
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,122
Avram Mandebon. I just saw him
in the street, honest.

56
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,043
Seniora, he hasn't changed.
He looks exactly the same.

57
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,961
Yisrael.

58
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,548
Which Avram? Dad's brother?

59
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,010
I swear, Nissim, I just saw him.
I wouldn't lie to you.

60
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,553
What is he doing here?

61
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,388
He finally came to
his brother's memorial.

62
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:14,392
Enough.
- Why? Because he's an uncle?

63
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,939
Have a seat.
Want some coffee?

64
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,442
I've dislocated my shoulder!

65
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,783
One... two... three...

66
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,661
It weighs a ton.

67
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,500
Be careful!

68
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,004
What happened?
- You got up late today...

69
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,631
I'll play you a song
that'll set your hair on fire.

70
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,469
What's this?
- A mast for the bonfire.

71
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,056
Tie a rag doll to the top
and it'll be a great bonfire.

72
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,351
Make the doll a Brezhinev.
- No. This year it's De-Gaulle.

73
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,481
What?

74
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:47,485
Lt'll look better if you
twist it around like this.

75
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,487
You twist yours!

76
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,157
Do you owe me any money?
- I don't owe you anything.

77
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,825
Just asking.

78
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,660
Want to play again?

79
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:58,830
Show me some money.

80
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,458
Enough?

81
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,626
Pull up a crate.

82
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,263
Both face cards lose,
the ace is the winner.

83
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,515
Watch carefully.
Don't whine later.

84
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,523
Three cards: King here,
ace here, and queen here.

85
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,901
King here, queen here,
and the ace here.

86
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,904
Where's the ace?
- Morad, it's in the middle.

87
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,739
It's in the middle.

88
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,824
How do you flip a match?

89
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,994
Morad, do me a favor...
- Get lost!

90
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,710
Show me how to flip a match.
- Get lost, you Jellyfish!

91
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,592
Both face cards lose,
the ace is the winner.

92
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,516
David, how are you, honey?

93
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,267
Wait a second,
I want to talk to you.

94
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,644
Wait a minute!

95
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,729
Give me back my stockings,
you thief!

96
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,940
Do you hear me, David?!

97
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,903
Sarah, go home.
Your food is getting cold.

98
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,702
Queen loses, king loses.
Where's the ace?

99
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,164
Queen.

100
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,627
Let's play again.

101
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,212
He's broke.

102
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,673
Let him play for credit.
- I need a guarantee.

103
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,967
Where can I get a guarantee?
- He hasn't got anything.

104
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,261
He can wager the "mop".
- What?

105
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,639
Wager the "mop".
- Over my dead body!

106
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,808
Suit yourself.

107
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:42,934
Wait a minute, dumbo.

108
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,477
Morad, don't worry, he'll lose.

109
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,021
I can feel it this time.

110
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,403
Alright, the "mop"
against the entire pot.

111
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,908
Winner takes all.
- Agreed.

112
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,243
Sit down.

113
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,040
Stay out of it.
This time I'm on my own.

114
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,750
Morad, we'll hex him.

115
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,632
No hexing!
- Oh, alright.

116
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:21,056
Both face cards lose,
the ace is the winner.

117
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,102
Where's the ace?

118
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,357
Are you sure?

119
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,818
Up to your tricks again?
- No tricks.

120
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,197
You can still change your mind.
- This one.

121
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,910
Damn!

122
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,377
Give me the "mop".

123
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,547
Once he brings the money,
you give it back.

124
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,132
Remember, you give it back.

125
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,051
Bring the money,
get the "mop" back.

126
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,888
If he doesn't return it,
we'll pluck out his eyebrows.

127
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,189
Take good care of it!

128
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,384
Taking him for a joyride?
- Hi!

129
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,971
Oh my goodness!
- What is it?

130
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,266
What have you done to yourself?

131
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,518
He looks good like this.

132
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,732
He lost the "mop" to Yisrael.

133
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,192
He'll give it back to me
once I pay.

134
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,902
Sure.

135
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,406
So, planning to set
the neighborhood on fire?

136
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,075
The bonfire they put up
in the Ezra quarter

137
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,703
is nothing compared to ours.

138
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,831
It wasn't the real thing.
They only had tires to burn.

139
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,708
We'll use wood.

140
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,377
Isn't this a tire?
- No, it's for sitting on.

141
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,922
Will there be hot potatoes?
- Charcoal, more likely.

142
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:20,592
Who's that yelling?

143
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,307
Climb aboard.
Let's get moving.

144
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,185
Step on it, Baruch!

145
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,146
Don't take my gas canisters!
- I'll bring them back.

146
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,899
No, don't take them!
- I'll bring them back!

147
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,195
What's going on?
- Nothing. Clear the area.

148
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,780
He's taking my canisters.

149
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,740
I told you,
I'll bring them back.

150
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,868
Mrs. Leah, please step aside.

151
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,829
Now put them back
and beat it.

152
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,623
And don't raise any dust.

153
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,168
Do you think you're
the law around here?

154
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,754
It's between me and her,
so keep out of it!

155
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,215
Beat it before I spatter you
all over the place.

156
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,140
Enough, Nissim.

157
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,893
If I see you here again

158
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,853
I'll chop off your legs.

159
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,190
Get lost.

160
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,120
Mrs. Leah, don't worry,
we'll put back the canisters.

161
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,540
Bless you. He keeps
stealing them all the time.

162
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:37,043
Don't worry, he won't be
back again. - Thank you.

163
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,214
Wow, almost...

164
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,175
Aim it higher...

165
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,888
You did it, Morad.

166
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,016
You're the champ.

167
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,018
It's caught fire!

168
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:57,147
Morad. Here's Aaron.
Ask him about the clothes.

169
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,318
Playing with fire?

170
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,113
Aaron, how are my clothes?

171
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,242
The trousers are all right,
but the shirt...

172
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,327
Come later,
I've got a shirt for you.

173
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,329
What happened
to your hair?

174
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,874
Yisrael's got it.
- Playing cards?

175
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,253
I'll get it back but...
- Natural looks best.

176
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,798
Don't block the passage.

177
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,052
Let me try once.

178
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:50,116
Need any help?
- Hey, Aaron.

179
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,581
You've grown stout.

180
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,125
We're not children anymore.

181
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,215
How are you?

182
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,259
All right.

183
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,556
It's been 25 years.

184
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,853
Gone in a flash.

185
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,900
How did he die, Aaron?

186
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,823
Merciful God, Morris's heart
gave way in his sleep.

187
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,325
He went to bed
and didn't get up again.

188
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,078
Was he angry at me?

189
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,583
Ever since you left
something inside of him died.

190
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,210
He was never the same again.

191
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,511
He loved you, Avram.

192
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,181
He missed you a lot.

193
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,062
I made a mistake.

194
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,982
I should have come back
to talk to him before he died.

195
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,574
At least you'll say Kaddish
at the service.

196
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,331
Yonatan, make sure
the potatoes don't burn.

197
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,002
Don't worry, I'll manage.

198
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,380
How long has Avram been gone?

199
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:31,259
20, maybe 15 years,
I don't know exactly.

200
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,222
Much more.
At least 30 years.

201
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,726
He left the night Morris
and Seniora got married.

202
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:43,646
Shoo away the smoke.
I remember that wedding.

203
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,733
People drowned in tears.

204
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,904
Why did he leave?

205
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:56,159
Why? He and Morris
argued over the theater.

206
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,121
Go.

207
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,626
What's he come back for?

208
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,587
What for? To say Kaddish
for his brother.

209
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,964
He's a year late.

210
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,308
He asked about you.

211
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:21,851
Your turn.

212
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,272
Aren't you going
to talk to him?

213
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:32,987
What's there to talk about?
- Life.

214
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,533
Whose life?

215
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,018
We'll use a large board.
- Yes.

216
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:48,229
Here we install the crossbar
of the bicycle

217
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,190
and these are the handlebars.

218
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,485
The white wheel goes here...

219
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:57,155
One wheel over here,
and another over here.

220
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,616
What about axles?
- Axles?

221
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:04,079
One plank here,
and another over here.

222
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,498
How is it going to hold?
- Size 10 nails.

223
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:11,961
We overturn this crate
and install it up here.

224
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:17,342
It can carry lots of wood.
- A real jet wagon!

225
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:21,429
I can't get that dream
about Dad out of my mind.

226
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:24,391
That's because
of his memorial service.

227
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:28,395
George, he wants us
to undo the vow.

228
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:31,940
The place's been closed for
30 years. It's all in ruins.

229
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,441
So what?

230
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,443
We can get it
organized in a jiffy.

231
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,032
Hi there.

232
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,828
What are you up to,
building a spaceship?

233
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:47,622
We'll use it
to carry the lumber.

234
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:50,417
A lumber shuttle to
clear the entire neighborhood.

235
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:52,460
What are you doing?

236
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:56,047
I've been trying to open it
for half an hour!

237
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,509
Try the other way around.
- I knew it!

238
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,640
Any coffee?
- It's on its way.

239
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,113
Binyamin, how are you?

240
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,282
Okay, Mrs. Seniora. And you?

241
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:25,452
Fine. How much is this?
- 5 shekels.

242
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:28,204
And the apples?
- 6 shekels.

243
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,915
Need anything else?
- No.

244
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,339
Weigh them for me, please.

245
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,812
Hello, Seniora.

246
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,900
Weigh them, please.

247
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,293
Look at this.
- Great.

248
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:17,504
Now take it apart.

249
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,881
We need the fork.
- Alright.

250
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:23,051
Come on, Morad,
do your Tarzan bit.

251
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,762
Lay off it, George,
we've got a wagon to build.

252
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:28,682
Come on. You haven't
done it in a long while.

253
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,101
Just once for the gang.

254
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:32,602
Go for it.

255
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,690
You guys are something...

256
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,748
What's this yelling
first thing in the morning?

257
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,127
I almost lost my breath.
- Aaron, how are the trousers?

258
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:59,379
Bend your leg.

259
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,756
What is this?
- Gabardine.

260
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,758
This is gabardine?!

261
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,303
Even I can't tell what
this could possibly be.

262
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,223
Go to the tailor,
he'll make you a decent pair.

263
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:11,433
Tell him Aaron sent you.

264
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,059
Right on, Aaron!

265
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:19,441
Any coffee?

266
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:33,788
Aaron, could you operate
a movie projector?

267
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,750
Are you trying to rub
salt into my wounds?

268
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,918
Why do you ask?

269
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,129
We want to screen
a movie in the theater.

270
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,675
Which theater?
- Dad's theater.

271
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,887
Dad's theater is dead!

272
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:52,557
Dad came to Nissim in a dream
and told him to open the theater.

273
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,267
To undo the vow.

274
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,981
I swear, Aaron,
those were his very words.

275
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,862
You've got to ask your uncle.

276
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,323
What's he got to do with it?

277
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:11,034
He owns half the theater.

278
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:13,328
You're paying him
too much respect.

279
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:16,539
That's not the issue.
You should ask him.

280
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:20,126
Dad vowed to stop screening movies.
He never said not to go inside.

281
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,212
I'm going to open it.

282
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,550
He's not joking. We're going
to open the theater.

283
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,628
I'm going in.

284
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:05,565
What?

285
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,443
It's stuffy.

286
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:04,332
Look what we smoked
in the old days.

287
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:12,966
Our orangeade.

288
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:27,522
"Day of Vengeance,"
starring Juliano Jemma.

289
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:30,025
There's Lee Van Cleef.

290
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:35,238
Not with the scissors.
Don't cut any hair, Leon.

291
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:38,575
Put your hands here.
That's it, that's the way.

292
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,661
From here
and then round it out.

293
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:45,415
It's impossible, Yisrael.
- Spray it, then shape it.

294
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,959
How does Fuad
keep his mustache stiff?

295
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:58,219
Are the Mandebon brothers
going to reopen the theater?

296
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:01,848
Why would they?
Who goes to movies these days?

297
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:04,267
So what were they
doing there inside?

298
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:07,187
They can't go into the theater.

299
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:10,065
It would break the vow.
- What are you talking about?

300
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:11,983
I saw them with my own eyes.

301
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:21,785
Yisrael, get up.

302
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,671
Have a seat, Avram.

303
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,426
How have you been?

304
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:40,970
A shave?

305
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:46,851
"Desperado Square"

306
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:05,328
Hey, who invented the cart?

307
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:09,040
It's Morad's design.
He put together a jet!

308
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:13,920
You've got a criminal mind, Morad.

309
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:15,672
Sarah, what are you doing here?

310
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,008
Waiting for Jellyfish David
to come out of the club.

311
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:21,678
Did you bring the telephone pole?

312
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:24,597
You bet,
we busted our asses.

313
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,599
Don't worry, I'll find you more.

314
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,687
Who'd like to braid my hair?

315
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:33,314
Me, Sarah, please.
- Me, sweetheart.

316
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,983
No, me.
- Let me do it.

317
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:37,027
Yonatan first, then Baruch.

318
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,778
Let me iron out the curls.

319
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:41,031
Maybe later.

320
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:43,992
Give me your hands.

321
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:48,872
Your hair's tough as nails.
- Watch your language.

322
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:51,791
Don't pull it tight.
- Focus on the game.

323
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,501
You always blow it.

324
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:55,962
From beneath...

325
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:39,422
Dances well, doesn't he?

326
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,384
Yudakis says
you have a fine voice.

327
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:44,761
Fine for the shower.

328
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,222
I'll set you one onstage.

329
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,100
Sophisticated, huh?

330
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:56,981
Aren't you bored alone?
- No, I like it this way.

331
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:22,507
Your son is working hard.

332
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:27,929
That's okay, let her
wear him out a bit.

333
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:42,754
What's this?
- It's what they do in Greece.

334
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:44,964
So go to Greece,
before I kick your ass!

335
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,694
Morad, how are the braids?
- Better than Yonatan's.

336
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:15,578
George, tell Nissim
not to kick me in the ass.

337
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:16,955
You're driving him crazy.

338
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,040
But he kicks me
in front of everybody.

339
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:21,960
I'll tell him,
not in front of everybody.

340
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:31,136
What now?
- Sarah's sitting over there.

341
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:34,723
So wait till she leaves.

342
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:49,571
We don't need more eggplant,
but bring some pickles.

343
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:51,990
And more olives too.

344
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:56,578
Why won't he listen to me?
- Enough. What now?

345
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,794
What's the matter? - What?
- Hurts, doesn't it?

346
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,421
Where are my things?
- What things?

347
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:08,923
My cassettes that I gave you.

348
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:10,675
I returned them,
you don't remember.

349
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,011
And the stockings you stole.

350
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:16,806
What did you do with her stuff?
- I swear she's forgotten, Yonatan.

351
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:19,267
Give it back before
she pours out your brains.

352
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,104
Where's all the stuff you stole?
- Answer him.

353
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:25,690
Alright, I'll give it back.

354
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:29,027
I'm sick and tired of you.
- Bring it back quick!

355
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:30,904
Everybody here's a witness.

356
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:38,661
The cassettes and the stocking.

357
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:41,289
You can all sit on my dick!

358
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:43,458
Catch the sonofabitch!

359
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:56,596
What a jerk.

360
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:02,769
Nissim, don't kick him in the ass
in front of everybody.

361
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:09,317
He came crying to you?
Did you see his prick?

362
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:12,070
He dangles it in front of me.

363
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:24,958
Check out Yisrael
and his fancy hairdo.

364
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:27,460
He's doing Raj Kapoor.

365
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:31,923
Who's Raj Kapoor?
- The great Indian movie star.

366
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:36,344
Yisrael had seen
lots of movies, hasn't he?

367
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,847
He used to peep in
from the roof of the theater.

368
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:44,144
Till one day your dad caught him
and knocked him out cold.

369
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:47,647
Next day he'd show up again,
as if nothing happened.

370
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:50,734
Aaron, which movies were
the big blockbusters?

371
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:56,239
First there was Godzilla,
then Machista, then Hercules.

372
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:59,284
Then came Zorro,
then the cowboys.

373
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:01,411
Once we started
showing Indian movies,

374
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,496
that was all people
wanted to see.

375
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:06,916
3 hour long movies,
full of singing and dancing.

376
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,210
The show would start
at 16:30.

377
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,880
By 15:00 people were
already lining up for tickets.

378
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:14,799
When the theater shut down

379
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:18,678
people went crazy,
got really depressed.

380
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:20,680
Especially Yisrael.

381
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:24,601
He scribbled
"Desperado Square" on the wall.

382
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:28,104
Which movie should we screen?

383
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:32,567
If you screen an Indian movie,
the neighborhood will go wild.

384
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:33,735
Which one?

385
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:38,281
Ask Yisrael. He'll know for sure.

386
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:41,326
Yisrael!

387
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:45,038
Yisrael, come over here.

388
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,751
Turn around for us.

389
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:55,382
It's a perfect fit.
- Thank you, George.

390
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:56,758
Have a seat.

391
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:10,522
"The Wanderer".
- Who made it? - Raj Kapoor.

392
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:15,694
Who played in "Mother India"?
- Nargis, Sunil Dat, Rajandra Kumar.

393
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:17,570
Ask something really hard.

394
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,865
Yisrael, which Indian movie

395
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:24,661
was the biggest hit of all time?

396
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:29,249
There are a few.
- Not a few, the biggest.

397
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,835
The one movie that
everyone loved the most.

398
00:37:34,212 --> 00:37:35,213
"Sangam."

399
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:39,592
I swear, George.

400
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:42,095
Isn't it?

401
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,890
"Sangam" was a big hit,
it played for half a year.

402
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:49,519
Until Morris shut the theater.
- Too bad about the theater.

403
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:53,148
What was the name, "Sangam"?

404
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:57,235
In Indian it means "meeting."
- It has a great story-line

405
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:03,742
about two lifelong friends
named Goppal and Sundar,

406
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:07,495
both of them in love with Radha
but neither knows about the other.

407
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:11,833
When Goppal discovers that
Sundar is in love with Radha too

408
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:16,671
he bows out in his favor
on account of true friendship.

409
00:38:17,547 --> 00:38:18,548
Quite a story.

410
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:20,925
For years Goppal suffers silently

411
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:25,388
because he loved Radha
and Radha loved him.

412
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:27,265
A real man!

413
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:31,269
He gave up his true love
for the sake of friendship!

414
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:35,231
It all turns out
very sad in the end.

415
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:38,068
Your mom can tell you
what a great movie it was.

416
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:42,697
Cheers.

417
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:47,202
Besides, the stars of the movie
are Raj Kapoor, Rajandra Kumar

418
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:49,954
and Vyjan Tamila,
really great actors.

419
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:51,748
The songs are in color.

420
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:54,834
There are 31 acts,
it's almost 4 hours long.

421
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:57,379
They don't make them
like that anymore.

422
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:24,114
That's the music
I heard in my dream.

423
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:25,490
No kidding?

424
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:33,206
"Sangam" is it.

425
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:39,212
Is "Sangam" going to play again?

426
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:42,048
Calm down,
Yisrael.

427
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,430
Why "Sangam"?

428
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:52,475
Why, isn't it the best?
- No, it isn't the best.

429
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:55,895
Aaron and Yisrael both say
it's a blast.

430
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:59,149
Where will you find it?
- At the dealer's.

431
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:03,236
Forget about Indian movies,
people won't come.

432
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:06,156
What are you talking about?
People love them.

433
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:09,242
Forget about "Sangam,"
try a different movie.

434
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:14,414
Mom...

435
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:19,169
What's gotten into her?

436
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:22,422
Did you see that?
- I was sure she'd be pleased.

437
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,800
Since when do I drink tea anyway?

438
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:38,646
Hey, asshole, if you don't stop
I'll bash in your face!

439
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:41,024
Hi, Pyramid.

440
00:40:42,317 --> 00:40:43,318
What's up?

441
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:45,278
He's splitting my head
with that song of his.

442
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:49,908
Same tune all the time.
I've begged him to stop.

443
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:53,578
He wants to be a singer. Where's
the projector? - Under the canvas.

444
00:40:55,246 --> 00:40:57,999
Pyramid, can we
take these boards?

445
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:00,001
Only the ones on top.

446
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:02,087
You've got lots.
Show some generosity.

447
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:03,296
I need them.

448
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,759
Can you lift this projector
by yourself?

449
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:09,469
Even with my teeth.

450
00:41:09,594 --> 00:41:13,765
Come on, Pyramid, do Hercules
against the Titans for them.

451
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:16,601
Not now.
- Come on, one little Hercules.

452
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:18,728
Just once for the gang.

453
00:41:18,853 --> 00:41:21,231
I'm going nuts
from the damn "pom-pa".

454
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,109
We'll put everything
back in place.

455
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:25,860
Just a quick one.

456
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:27,862
Morad, get him the stick.

457
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:38,623
He looks just like Steve Rivers.
Just like a Roman.

458
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,543
From here he looks
more like a Crusader.

459
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:43,545
No way, like a conquistador.

460
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,551
No conquistador and no Crusader,
I'm going to teach him to sing.

461
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:51,594
Where are you going?

462
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,809
That "pom-pa" can really
drive you nuts.

463
00:41:57,976 --> 00:42:01,021
Finally got here, Pyramid?
- You've fucked my mind!

464
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:03,231
You want to be a singer?

465
00:42:04,524 --> 00:42:06,818
You've ruined my health!

466
00:42:07,277 --> 00:42:08,945
It's his legs!

467
00:42:10,238 --> 00:42:13,116
No, it's his kneecaps.
I can tell by the sound.

468
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,165
Now it's the legs!

469
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:23,877
Hello, George. Hello, Nissim.
Nothing wrong with Yudakis, I hope?

470
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,962
No, don't worry.

471
00:42:26,087 --> 00:42:30,133
I thought maybe
you'd come to find a new singer.

472
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,429
Where would we find such a voice?
- Nowhere. He's a great singer.

473
00:42:34,637 --> 00:42:37,223
To what do I owe the honor?
- We're looking for a movie.

474
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:41,019
A movie? Which?
- "Sangam."

475
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:49,527
What's wrong, cat got your tongue?
- This is a real surprise.

476
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:52,655
Whatever made you
think of "Sangam"?

477
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:54,074
Never mind,
just look for it.

478
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,534
If I had "Sangam"
would I be sitting in this office?

479
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:57,786
Look for it.

480
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:01,122
How about cowboys, a western?

481
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,458
No westerns.
Just get us "Sangam."

482
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:07,253
Okay, let's take a look.

483
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:12,092
"The Wanderer", "Mother India"...

484
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:15,762
"A Night in Paris"...

485
00:43:16,137 --> 00:43:17,889
Here, see for yourself.

486
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:21,935
"Sangam"...rubbed out.

487
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,187
It's been rubbed out.

488
00:43:24,312 --> 00:43:26,731
I told you I didn't
have the movie.

489
00:43:34,155 --> 00:43:37,534
Jango is lying in the mud
as the Mexicans kick him

490
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:39,619
mercilessly in the face

491
00:43:39,953 --> 00:43:43,498
and smash the palm of his hands
with their rifle butts.

492
00:43:43,623 --> 00:43:45,000
"Where is the gold?"

493
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:47,544
"In the cemetery,"
he says.

494
00:43:48,586 --> 00:43:53,258
So Fernando Sancho
lets out a huge roar:

495
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:56,052
Muchachos... amigos...
tequila.

496
00:43:56,761 --> 00:43:59,097
And the Mexicans
begin to celebrate.

497
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:02,434
Meanwhile Jango
manages to escape

498
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:04,310
but he doesn't
forget to take the coffin

499
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:06,146
he's been dragging
the entire movie.

500
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,231
He opens the coffin

501
00:44:08,356 --> 00:44:12,402
and takes out a huge machine gun
with revolving barrel and hand-crank.

502
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:14,946
He mounts it on a grave

503
00:44:15,071 --> 00:44:17,115
and waits for the
Mexicans to arrive.

504
00:44:17,615 --> 00:44:19,075
Meanwhile, he pulls out
a bottle of whiskey

505
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,579
and gulps down a few sips.
A few minutes later

506
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:29,586
Fernando Sancho shows up
with 50 or 60 roughnecks,

507
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:32,630
each one uglier than the next.

508
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:34,841
They get off their horses.

509
00:44:34,966 --> 00:44:36,885
Jango takes his time.

510
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,972
He tosses away the bottle and
strips the blanket from the gun,

511
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:43,808
grips the hand-crank and...

512
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:49,731
In just seconds he mows down
the entire band of Mexicans.

513
00:44:49,856 --> 00:44:52,192
Some of them fall this way,
others fall that way.

514
00:44:53,151 --> 00:44:56,196
So he killed all of them?
- Rubbed them out completely.

515
00:44:56,404 --> 00:44:59,032
He plugged them full of holes

516
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:01,910
so the tequila poured
out of them.

517
00:45:02,577 --> 00:45:05,580
In short, the Mexicans
came looking for gold

518
00:45:06,414 --> 00:45:08,333
and got hot lead instead.

519
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:11,169
They made great movies
in the old days...

520
00:45:11,711 --> 00:45:14,881
Yonatan, who's stronger,
Hercules or Machista? - Machista.

521
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:16,716
Are you kidding?
Hercules is stronger.

522
00:45:16,841 --> 00:45:18,927
No way, Machista is stronger.

523
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:21,388
Aaron, who's stronger,
Machista or Hercules?

524
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:24,516
Machista is no competition,
Hercules was much stronger.

525
00:45:24,891 --> 00:45:26,351
What did I tell you?

526
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,232
So, do we have a projector?
- You bet.

527
00:45:32,565 --> 00:45:33,817
How about the movie?

528
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:39,614
The movie? The dealer says that of
all the movies he bought from Dad

529
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:42,701
only "Sangam" is missing.
- Where could it be?

530
00:45:45,328 --> 00:45:47,414
Only your uncle could have it.

531
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,417
But wait and I'll find out.

532
00:46:03,638 --> 00:46:04,639
Hey, Avram.

533
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:08,018
How's it going?
- Alright.

534
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:14,149
Tell me, have you got "Sangam"?

535
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:15,942
What?

536
00:46:16,067 --> 00:46:18,486
The movie "Sangam,"
haven't you got it?

537
00:46:20,321 --> 00:46:21,865
What do you want?

538
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,451
We want to screen it
in the movie theater.

539
00:46:26,578 --> 00:46:28,621
No movie, Aaron.

540
00:46:30,206 --> 00:46:32,584
The dealer says that of all the
movies he bought,

541
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:35,337
only "Sangam" is missing.
So where could it be?

542
00:46:36,087 --> 00:46:37,714
Only you could have it.

543
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:44,304
Tell me, is Seniora behind it all?

544
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:46,931
Enough, Avram,
don't be stubborn.

545
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:50,018
Come see how we've put
new chairs in the theater,

546
00:46:50,185 --> 00:46:52,354
a new screen and projector.

547
00:46:55,106 --> 00:46:58,360
Come on, let's relive
our old dreams.

548
00:47:00,987 --> 00:47:02,489
The past is dead.

549
00:47:04,157 --> 00:47:06,242
It's dead.

550
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:45,115
Raise it a little more.
Some more. That's it.

551
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:49,661
Watch out, Morad,
you'll burn down the theater!

552
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:51,121
Are you mad?

553
00:48:11,641 --> 00:48:13,143
Bored?

554
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:16,354
Why do you think I'm bored?

555
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:21,484
Watch my little girl, I'm going
to get her something to drink.

556
00:48:32,954 --> 00:48:35,582
How are you, Amalya?
- Alright.

557
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:39,044
Look at me.

558
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:46,134
How do I look?
- Handsome.

559
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:50,472
What does your mom say
about me? - Cute.

560
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:54,642
Cute means imbecile.
- That's right.

561
00:48:56,686 --> 00:48:59,606
Won't you put in a word for me?
- Do it yourself.

562
00:49:00,273 --> 00:49:01,649
You're just like your mom.

563
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:04,402
He'll spoil your girl.
- Don't interfere.

564
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:10,075
Why are you mixing her up?
- This is serious conversation!

565
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,452
Playing the bogey man...

566
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:15,497
I heard there's a new singer.

567
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:18,083
No, she only sings
in the shower.

568
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:20,460
I bet you'd love
to do backing vocals.

569
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:22,128
Did I say anything?

570
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:25,256
No, you're a real silent movie.

571
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:27,050
Come on, honey.

572
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,401
Got the hots?

573
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,987
I'm burning!

574
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:53,368
Now it's my turn.

575
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:56,454
Sarah, I'm in a big hurry.
I don't want to play anymore.

576
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:59,165
Sarah, it'll be easier
to hit him from here.

577
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:03,586
Sarah, I've got things to do.

578
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,259
Morad, you said that
we'd change places.

579
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:13,471
You promised, Morad.
I don't want to play anymore.

580
00:50:13,596 --> 00:50:15,682
Enough, Morad!

581
00:50:19,352 --> 00:50:22,105
Morad, I swear that I'll
give her back the stocking!

582
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:32,490
Release him right away.

583
00:50:32,615 --> 00:50:35,285
We were just fooling with him.
- Stop fooling with him.

584
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:40,331
Nissim, he asked for it.
- Okay, clear out of here.

585
00:50:40,457 --> 00:50:44,002
Nissim, I want him to give back
my stocking and my cassettes.

586
00:50:44,419 --> 00:50:47,339
Alright, move it.
Clear out of here.

587
00:50:50,592 --> 00:50:54,220
7 against 1? Shame on you.
- You shut up!

588
00:50:54,554 --> 00:50:56,097
Come here.

589
00:50:57,932 --> 00:51:00,935
Come over here!

590
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:18,328
What's this?

591
00:51:19,162 --> 00:51:20,997
It's Sarah's.

592
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:23,375
This is Sarah's?

593
00:51:25,418 --> 00:51:28,588
You had everyone alarmed,
we were sure it was real.

594
00:51:30,298 --> 00:51:33,176
Go on, take it apart and
return the stocking to her.

595
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,221
Go on,
return it to her!

596
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,919
Don't like resistance,
do you?

597
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:10,922
It runs in the family.

598
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:30,483
Aren't you going to sing?

599
00:55:08,183 --> 00:55:11,478
We'll pay him,
how much does he want?

600
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,857
It's not a matter
of money, Nissim.

601
00:55:16,107 --> 00:55:20,612
So what's the problem?
What does he want?

602
00:55:23,531 --> 00:55:25,825
You can't give him
what he wants.

603
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:31,664
I could get it in a cinch.
You pay him too much respect.

604
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:37,295
Be patient, Nissim.

605
00:55:52,352 --> 00:55:53,353
Yisrael.

606
00:55:55,897 --> 00:55:58,983
Is it holding in the wind?
- Like concrete.

607
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:01,111
If it doesn't hold,
use thumbtacks.

608
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,322
Have you got the jitters?
- Have I got the jitters?

609
00:56:04,447 --> 00:56:06,658
My stomach is churning,
I'm counting the minutes.

610
00:56:07,325 --> 00:56:08,993
Come here, sit down.

611
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:21,840
Now you won't have
to climb on the roof.

612
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:26,761
Now you'll have a ticket.

613
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:31,433
Yeah, but it'd better be
a good seat in the middle.

614
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:34,769
Yisrael, how many times
have you seen "Sangam"?

615
00:56:35,228 --> 00:56:38,023
A 100 maybe 200 times.

616
00:56:39,107 --> 00:56:41,234
From the matinee show
until 4 in the morning.

617
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,820
Why do you always
exaggerate?

618
00:56:44,195 --> 00:56:46,239
No exaggeration, I swear.

619
00:56:46,573 --> 00:56:48,283
First, the matinee show...

620
00:56:48,491 --> 00:56:49,868
then the evening show...

621
00:56:49,993 --> 00:56:52,704
and the late night show
with Avram and Seniora.

622
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:01,463
I swear.

623
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:05,425
I'd peek from the roof.

624
00:57:05,925 --> 00:57:09,554
What an amazing view.
- Which roof?

625
00:57:10,263 --> 00:57:12,432
The roof of the theater.

626
00:57:12,557 --> 00:57:15,560
You saw Avram and Seniora
from the roof?

627
00:57:15,685 --> 00:57:18,772
They used to watch "Sangam."
- Did you ever tell anyone?

628
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,234
No, I swear.

629
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:25,445
Yisrael.

630
00:57:31,242 --> 00:57:33,286
Don't speak like that
about Seniora

631
00:57:33,411 --> 00:57:36,498
because it could make
the wrong impression.

632
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:39,751
I won't say anything.

633
00:57:41,753 --> 00:57:44,130
Go on inside.

634
00:58:02,315 --> 00:58:04,401
Is that the truth
or is he making it up?

635
00:58:08,279 --> 00:58:10,865
You think Dad shut down
the theater without a reason?

636
00:58:14,869 --> 00:58:15,870
So?

637
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:19,332
Do you mean to tell me that
Mom was involved with Avram?

638
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:21,918
I really don't know.

639
00:58:31,302 --> 00:58:34,431
For the eternal soul of Morris,
the son of Rebecca Mandebon.

640
00:58:34,764 --> 00:58:37,684
May the spirit of the Lord
be his guide to Paradise.

641
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:43,732
Amen!

642
00:58:44,649 --> 00:58:47,193
Amen.
- Amen.

643
00:58:50,321 --> 00:58:52,157
What's the matter with you?

644
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:55,493
Everything's alright, Mom.

645
00:58:56,828 --> 00:58:59,706
We're going to the synagogue
to check if everything's ready.

646
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:08,340
Get up already.

647
00:59:09,466 --> 00:59:11,593
Go on, get up!

648
00:59:14,262 --> 00:59:16,681
Go straight!

649
00:59:18,933 --> 00:59:21,186
What do you thing you're doing?

650
00:59:22,937 --> 00:59:25,315
That's it.
You can park here.

651
00:59:27,233 --> 00:59:28,610
Come on, Morad.

652
00:59:28,735 --> 00:59:31,488
Look how much wood Yisrael's got!

653
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:37,285
Did I split my skull?
- No, just a tiny bump.

654
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:40,205
Damn this board!
- What's the problem?

655
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:42,999
This board is the problem!
- Let's take it to the bonfire.

656
00:59:43,124 --> 00:59:44,793
It's good for the bonfire!

657
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:48,797
Pull, pull hard.
It's no good this way.

658
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:53,176
Come over here.
- No, I'll go there.

659
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,513
All together now:

660
00:59:56,638 --> 00:59:58,723
One, two, three, pull...

661
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:04,646
Oh no, look what we've done!

662
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:07,774
Now he'll be able to get
the motorcycle inside.

663
01:00:07,899 --> 01:00:09,943
We've made him a garage.

664
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:12,696
Come on, let's take the boards.

665
01:00:18,076 --> 01:00:21,579
Dear Morris,
God bless his soul.

666
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:29,796
Seniora.

667
01:00:30,797 --> 01:00:33,383
Life is a flowing river and
we're not getting any younger.

668
01:00:33,508 --> 01:00:36,386
Whatever is left unresolved
will remain that way forever.

669
01:00:37,345 --> 01:00:40,849
You should talk to him.

670
01:00:41,182 --> 01:00:43,435
I'm not going to talk to him.

671
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,395
It'll turn out badly,
I'm telling you.

672
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:48,314
Nissim is furious.

673
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:53,778
You're the only one
he'll give the movie to.

674
01:00:53,903 --> 01:00:56,406
They can screen
a different movie.

675
01:00:56,531 --> 01:00:58,658
There's no point now
in opening old wounds.

676
01:00:58,783 --> 01:01:00,660
Will there ever be
an end to the story?

677
01:01:00,785 --> 01:01:02,537
It ended long ago.

678
01:01:03,538 --> 01:01:05,290
Know when, Aaron?

679
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:08,752
That night when I waited
for him beside the theater.

680
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:12,547
"I'll just go talk to Morris,
I'll be right back," he said.

681
01:01:14,674 --> 01:01:17,010
I waited all night.
Until morning.

682
01:01:17,886 --> 01:01:20,138
Until the sun rose.

683
01:01:22,223 --> 01:01:24,017
That's when it ended.

684
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:34,527
Be careful.
- Move aside.

685
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:41,326
You're a whale, damn you!

686
01:01:41,659 --> 01:01:43,995
Enough, Morad,
or I'll drown you.

687
01:02:05,892 --> 01:02:08,895
Yisrael, come in! What are
you afraid of? Come on!

688
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:00,674
What's he doing here?

689
01:04:15,188 --> 01:04:18,692
Why has he come now? He didn't
bother to come to the funeral.

690
01:04:18,817 --> 01:04:22,445
Let him be.
- Why should I?

691
01:04:22,696 --> 01:04:24,948
He's won't give the movie
yet has the nerve to come here!

692
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:27,117
Enough, Nissim, not now.

693
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:54,102
The sons of the deceased
will say Kaddish.

694
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:57,480
His brother too.
- He's not saying Kaddish for Dad!

695
01:04:57,647 --> 01:04:59,524
Calm down, Nissim,
he's his brother.

696
01:04:59,649 --> 01:05:02,152
He's not saying Kaddish
for Morris Mandebon.

697
01:05:03,653 --> 01:05:05,447
Not for Dad.

698
01:05:43,818 --> 01:05:45,362
What's the matter with you?

699
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:47,030
He came to say Kaddish
for his brother

700
01:05:47,155 --> 01:05:48,698
and you go crazy on him?

701
01:05:48,823 --> 01:05:50,158
In the synagogue,
for all to see?

702
01:05:50,283 --> 01:05:53,286
You think I don't know why
Dad shut down the theater?

703
01:05:55,413 --> 01:05:57,832
Aaron.
- What?

704
01:05:58,917 --> 01:06:00,960
Tell us what went on there.

705
01:06:01,086 --> 01:06:02,337
What do you mean?

706
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:07,175
You screened it for them.
- Yisrael told us all about it.

707
01:06:08,176 --> 01:06:09,177
It's true.

708
01:06:09,427 --> 01:06:11,888
I screened "Sangam" for them
when everyone had gone.

709
01:06:12,013 --> 01:06:15,558
So, was Avram
in love with Mom?

710
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:18,353
Everybody was.

711
01:06:19,437 --> 01:06:21,564
But as for her, she had
her heart set on Avram.

712
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,733
Did Dad know about it?

713
01:06:24,609 --> 01:06:27,529
If he'd known, he would
have stayed away from her.

714
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:32,117
But the parents arranged a match
and it put Avram in a terrible jam.

715
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:35,078
His only way out
was to disappear.

716
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:37,205
That's why he won't give us
the movie?

717
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:40,208
George, it's not just
any movie.

718
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:42,836
"Sangam" was their movie.

719
01:07:18,663 --> 01:07:21,499
"De-Gaulle"

720
01:07:23,626 --> 01:07:25,837
Morad, straighten out the doll.

721
01:07:29,758 --> 01:07:33,178
Watch out for nails, Baruch,
or you'll hurt yourself.

722
01:07:34,262 --> 01:07:37,098
We have to reinforce it, Yonatan.

723
01:07:37,557 --> 01:07:40,352
There won't be any "Sangam."
- Why? Too bad.

724
01:07:40,643 --> 01:07:43,730
There's no "Sangam"?
- Avram won't let them have it.

725
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:46,024
What a pity.

726
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:48,943
I saw the movie with my mother
30 years ago.

727
01:07:49,069 --> 01:07:51,529
Everyone cried.
It was so much fun.

728
01:07:51,654 --> 01:07:53,490
I really wanted to see it.

729
01:07:53,615 --> 01:07:56,701
Badriya told me about the
movie for 3 hours, crying,

730
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:59,829
and she said it was nothing
compared to the movie itself.

731
01:08:31,986 --> 01:08:32,987
Seniora.

732
01:08:52,257 --> 01:08:54,342
Why did you come here?

733
01:08:55,969 --> 01:08:58,054
To talk to you.

734
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:06,688
Not a day passed that
I didn't think of you.

735
01:09:16,656 --> 01:09:18,616
Thought of me?

736
01:09:19,617 --> 01:09:22,412
So why didn't you
talk to Morris?

737
01:09:22,662 --> 01:09:25,165
You promised
you'd tell him about us.

738
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:28,293
I didn't have the courage.

739
01:09:29,586 --> 01:09:32,005
He was so happy.

740
01:09:32,964 --> 01:09:36,634
When I came to talk to him, he
asked me to be his best man.

741
01:09:37,052 --> 01:09:39,846
The words stuck in my throat,
I couldn't speak a word.

742
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:42,891
So you ran away?

743
01:09:43,099 --> 01:09:47,145
Had I stayed, it'd be like
living in a cage all my life.

744
01:09:48,313 --> 01:09:50,106
I had to go.

745
01:09:51,983 --> 01:09:54,694
Had you talked to him,
he would have understood.

746
01:09:59,616 --> 01:10:01,701
I made a mistake, Seniora.

747
01:10:04,496 --> 01:10:07,082
Now there's nobody
to talk to anymore.

748
01:10:08,124 --> 01:10:10,418
What used to be
can never be again.

749
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:16,758
Seniora.

750
01:10:48,665 --> 01:10:53,753
"Morris Mandebon - R.I.P."

751
01:10:55,296 --> 01:10:58,550
You'll blast us to the sky
with your bonfire.

752
01:10:58,925 --> 01:11:01,720
We'll light the bonfire when
everyone leaves the theater.

753
01:11:02,053 --> 01:11:04,472
It'll be just like fireworks.

754
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:11,730
Hey, Avram?

755
01:11:13,106 --> 01:11:16,151
Come have coffee with us.
- Some other time.

756
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:23,700
Come and get "Sangam."

757
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,161
Right on!

758
01:11:29,372 --> 01:11:31,791
I'll send Yisrael to pick
it up on his motorcycle.

759
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:34,669
Come see the movie.

760
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:38,131
I'll save you a seat, Avram.

761
01:11:48,308 --> 01:11:53,646
"Sangam"

762
01:12:47,075 --> 01:12:51,246
Morad, put these fuel tanks inside.
Hide them well.

763
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:56,626
Morad! Look, it's leaking.

764
01:12:57,919 --> 01:12:59,838
Bring it over here.

765
01:13:00,296 --> 01:13:01,673
Plug it with this.

766
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:05,969
Wait a minute.
I have a better idea.

767
01:13:07,345 --> 01:13:09,931
You and your gizmos.

768
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:12,559
I hope this works.

769
01:13:12,684 --> 01:13:13,685
Good for you.

770
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:15,687
Morad, put it inside

771
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:17,772
so nobody will find it.

772
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,822
Put the board back
so nobody can see it.

773
01:13:31,911 --> 01:13:34,122
Bet you it's going to be
the biggest bonfire ever.

774
01:13:34,247 --> 01:13:36,458
We worked hard, didn't we?

775
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:38,793
Who'll guard the bonfire?

776
01:13:39,711 --> 01:13:41,546
How should I know?

777
01:13:41,713 --> 01:13:43,590
We'll post Jellyfish David.

778
01:13:44,174 --> 01:13:46,301
We'll be watching the movie.

779
01:13:46,551 --> 01:13:48,928
Okay, Jellyfish David,
he'll be the guard.
