00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,596
MEMORIES OF MY MELANCHOLY WHORES

2
00:00:45,357 --> 00:00:48,356
- Hello?
- Today is the day.

3
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:51,099
What day?

4
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,788
Tomorrow I'll be 90 years old,

5
00:00:56,195 --> 00:01:01,827
and I want to give myself
a crazy love night with a virgin.

6
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:05,945
Oh, it's you, my sad sage.

7
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,335
Disappear for 20 years and now
you demand the impossible.

8
00:01:11,631 --> 00:01:15,370
Is anything impossible for you,
dear Rosa Cabarcas.

9
00:01:56,392 --> 00:02:00,180
SOMEWHERE IN THE CARIBBEAN

10
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,559
I'm ugly, shy, and 
old-fashioned.

11
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:08,736
But using the power of
not wanting to be it,

12
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,014
I've managed to
play the opposite.

13
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:16,224
Until this sunrise
I've been able to show,

14
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:19,725
how I am through my
own free will,

15
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:23,272
although it serves only
to lighten my conscience.

16
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:57,975
A gentleman
should not spy.

17
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:01,328
And certainly not
on his own mother.

18
00:03:03,172 --> 00:03:04,924
But she is so beautiful.

19
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:16,235
SUNDAY OF THE SAGE -Selective Memory-
- Can we trust our brain?-

20
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:21,637
GLORIFICATION OF THE OLD AGE

21
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,447
When did I realize that I'm old?

22
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:40,524
I was less than half as old
as I am today...

23
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:48,076
when one day...

24
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:49,823
Say one!

25
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,832
One!

26
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:54,145
Say one!

27
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:56,323
One!

28
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,338
How old are you?

29
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,848
44.

30
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,356
Nothing's wrong
with your lungs.

31
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,768
But what's that pain
when I'm breathing?

32
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,798
It's normal for your age.

33
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:14,746
Then is something
wrong with my age?

34
00:04:15,105 --> 00:04:17,162
I see, you're a philosopher.

35
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:25,730
Philosopher.

36
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:38,198
God day.

37
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:47,199
No! Leave me!

38
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,307
Let me go!

39
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:05,361
The day has come.

40
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:07,404
Which day?

41
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:10,183
Tomorrow I'll be 90 years.

42
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:15,300
And I want to give myself
a crazy love night with a virgin.

43
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:19,917
Oh, it's you,
my sad sage.

44
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:24,658
Disappear for 20 years and now
you demand the impossible.

45
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:29,426
Is anything impossible for you,
dear Rosa Cabarcas.

46
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:32,542
Give me some time,
I'll see what I can do.

47
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:34,191
Listen, Rosa Cabarcas.

48
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:39,131
In my age an hour counts
like a whole year.

49
00:07:39,537 --> 00:07:44,770
I just want a virgin,
and I want her tonight.

50
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:49,879
But why a virgin?
They say, it's rarely enjoyable.

51
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:52,322
It's not about having fun.

52
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:55,669
It's a question of life or death.

53
00:07:56,785 --> 00:08:00,698
Virgins are out of fashion. What
do you want to prove to yourself?

54
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:02,555
Nothing!

55
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:04,816
I know very well,
what I'm able to.

56
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:07,464
I call back.

57
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,729
The moment she sensed
the sting,

58
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:16,538
she fell into a deep sleep.

59
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:21,511
That sleep overcame all
inhabitants of the castle.

60
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:24,421
The King and the Queen,

61
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:27,335
who had just entered
the vestibule,

62
00:08:27,653 --> 00:08:32,602
fell asleep, and with them
all their servants.

63
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:34,634
Also the horses.

64
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:39,698
When the prince came
into the vestibule,

65
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:43,378
all inhabitants of the castle
had fallen asleep.

66
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:14,464
Good day.

67
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,373
Damiana?
Are you coming on a Friday?

68
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:24,911
Shouldn't the apartment
look nice for tomorrow?

69
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,717
Is it important?

70
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:34,709
Listen, my girl!
There's nothing to be afraid of.

71
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,938
An old man.
How should he harm you?

72
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:43,039
In one night you can earn more
than in four weeks in the factory.

73
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:46,219
Doesn't it sound good?

74
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,821
Alright!
Only one thing:

75
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:53,198
Think more of your sick mother
and less of yourself!

76
00:11:26,844 --> 00:11:27,661
Yes?

77
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:30,107
You're a lucky fool.

78
00:11:30,412 --> 00:11:33,165
I've found a lovelier goose
than you asked for.

79
00:11:33,495 --> 00:11:34,815
That sounds good.

80
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,394
- But there's a problem.
- What?

81
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:41,459
As I told you, virgins are rare,
especially beautiful ones.

82
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,141
- And?
- I have doubts about her age.

83
00:11:46,547 --> 00:11:49,121
I was just a kid when I
lost my chastity.

84
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,894
You don't risk anything, but who will
pay me for three years in prison?

85
00:11:54,283 --> 00:11:58,451
No one goes to prison,
and last of all you.

86
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:03,450
The ones who could accuse you
are all your customers.

87
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,879
They wouldn't dare.

88
00:12:06,065 --> 00:12:08,665
But you must pay me
2 pesos more.

89
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:10,421
No problem.

90
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,368
Well, come at 10pm.

91
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,170
Any problems?

92
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,163
None!

93
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:05,868
Senor! It is not an entrance.
It's an exit.

94
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,206
You're dressing like a bishop
for a ritual.

95
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:24,884
Maybe.

96
00:13:25,924 --> 00:13:29,562
What do I know about
bishops' dressing habits?

97
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,063
When did you last
wear that suit?

98
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:36,266
Many years ago.

99
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:41,984
For a wedding.
Why?

100
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:46,764
It looks as if it's not yours.

101
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:57,727
Pardon.

102
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:47,595
Congratulations, my girl!
An exceptional choice.

103
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:51,974
Young man!

104
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,614
Can you come to the library
in ten minutes?

105
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,630
My love.

106
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:07,294
If you knew...

107
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:13,683
If only you knew,
how long I have longed for,

108
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:15,546
that you

109
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:19,620
should come through this door.

110
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,373
You smell like a perfumery.

111
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:46,962
Aqua de Florida. Only for men.

112
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,018
But I doubt you
just meet men?

113
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:52,263
That's true.

114
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,556
Will you be late?

115
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:57,133
One never knows.

116
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:02,270
Be careful. In a couple of hours
you won't be 89 anymore!

117
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:05,073
I know that myself.

118
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:27,498
Prominent wedding in
the Palomar de Castro family.

119
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:34,251
Well my love,
now there's no way back!

120
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:40,115
Young man, you shall know,

121
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,258
that we are honoured
to include

122
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:45,693
in our family
such a respectable journalist.

123
00:18:05,173 --> 00:18:07,403
Do you have a cigarette?

124
00:18:07,714 --> 00:18:11,593
33 years, 2 months and 17 days ago
I quit smoking.

125
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,927
I didn't think you were so old.

126
00:18:15,254 --> 00:18:17,028
You're very kind, my girl.

127
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:19,764
I wish, I had a cigarette for you.

128
00:18:22,086 --> 00:18:25,078
And then one over.

129
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:31,015
And one under.
And then one over again.

130
00:18:31,372 --> 00:18:33,047
I have to go.

131
00:18:50,164 --> 00:18:54,840
Ximena! A lady should
always wear underwear.

132
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:58,956
Some ladies are just
always ready for action.

133
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:02,958
But you don't belong to
that kind of ladies. Or do you?

134
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:08,172
I don't know.
Try it out!

135
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:11,677
I will, in a few days.

136
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:15,650
Couldn't you stay
a little longer?

137
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:21,263
I told you I have to work
for the Diario De La Paz tonight.

138
00:19:21,658 --> 00:19:25,014
And I must prepare myself
for the wedding.

139
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:43,082
With you I would even
do it for free.

140
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,379
Over my dead body.

141
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:53,055
Why?

142
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:56,898
My principles. I always pay
if I want something.

143
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,936
In other words...

144
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:12,091
If I had asked you to lie
with me,

145
00:20:14,104 --> 00:20:16,425
then I had to pay you?

146
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:17,532
No!

147
00:20:22,076 --> 00:20:23,799
That's unrighteous.

148
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,659
Who said life is righteous,
Casilda?

149
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,144
Be careful, Maestro.

150
00:20:45,707 --> 00:20:48,212
Rosa Cabarcas' house is not
the same anymore.

151
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:51,552
Thank you. Thank you.

152
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:01,990
God bless you, doctor.

153
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:04,157
Enjoy your fuck!

154
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,928
Thank you, my friend!

155
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:12,442
Until death parts us.

156
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:17,422
Will you honour these women?
Love them?

157
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:21,716
Take care for them?
Be faithful to them?

158
00:21:22,677 --> 00:21:24,315
Till death do us part.

159
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:27,154
Till death do us part.

160
00:21:27,468 --> 00:21:29,618
Till death do us part.

161
00:21:40,473 --> 00:21:42,116
Only one at a time!

162
00:21:43,081 --> 00:21:45,125
One... One at a time!

163
00:22:14,946 --> 00:22:17,585
You can pay me next week.

164
00:22:27,608 --> 00:22:28,943
You don't so old.

165
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:32,774
You do. But it suits you.

166
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:34,631
Really?

167
00:22:35,914 --> 00:22:39,792
The years have even shined up
your dead horse-face.

168
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:42,670
Cause the horse changed stable.

169
00:22:43,105 --> 00:22:46,731
You had a cock
like a galley slave.

170
00:22:47,893 --> 00:22:49,155
How are you?

171
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,838
The only change since
we met last

172
00:22:53,203 --> 00:22:56,752
is that my ass itches sometimes.
Always at full moon.

173
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,157
Lack of use.

174
00:22:59,424 --> 00:23:01,681
I only use it for
chastely purposes.

175
00:23:01,992 --> 00:23:04,665
Oh Maestro,
I didn't imply anything.

176
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:08,189
The girl! She has been
waiting since 10pm.

177
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:11,889
She is beautiful, clean
and has good manners.

178
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:15,074
But she's dying of fear,
because a girlfriend,

179
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:19,116
who ran away with a sailor,
bled to death within two hours.

180
00:23:20,073 --> 00:23:22,101
Poor girl... lets go.

181
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:28,340
In addition to all that
she sews buttons in a shirt factory.

182
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:33,057
It doesn't sound so hard?
- That's what men think.

183
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,295
It's worse than woodcutting.
Help me!

184
00:23:44,943 --> 00:23:47,173
The Bolero is life itself.

185
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,381
For whom are you mourning?

186
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:56,321
For my husband and my son.
They both left this world recently.

187
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,362
I'm sorry to hear that.

188
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:04,437
I gave her a mixture of valerian
and bromine. She sleeps now.

189
00:24:04,814 --> 00:24:05,912
Wait here!

190
00:24:18,978 --> 00:24:20,504
Yes, she sleeps.

191
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:29,784
Let her sleep as long
as possible.

192
00:24:30,143 --> 00:24:32,703
Your night is longer than hers.

193
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:39,185
What do you think, I should do?
- You'll find out.

194
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:41,506
It's you who's called
the sage.

195
00:25:37,923 --> 00:25:40,259
A tender bull before
the fight.

196
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,850
Shit!

197
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:22,632
What shall I do,
if you don't like me?

198
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:04,617
Take it easy, my girl.

199
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,542
Nobody will hurt you.

200
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:24,036
Delgadina, Delgadina...

201
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:31,873
Delgadina, Delgadina...

202
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:39,040
The bed of Delgadina...

203
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:45,436
...is watched by angels.

204
00:28:07,701 --> 00:28:09,864
Don't be afraid, my friend...

205
00:28:12,186 --> 00:28:15,303
Very soon you won't
feel pain anymore.

206
00:28:21,143 --> 00:28:23,291
The bell tolls anyway.

207
00:28:30,352 --> 00:28:35,520
In the end...
of this crazy love night...

208
00:28:38,722 --> 00:28:41,781
we'll be united
in the sleep.

209
00:29:10,008 --> 00:29:14,160
You must know I love you all,
but one at a time.

210
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:56,931
Goodbye forever.

211
00:31:02,238 --> 00:31:04,019
May God protect you.

212
00:31:18,027 --> 00:31:19,382
Never again!

213
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:12,341
Tell me, Damiana.

214
00:32:12,642 --> 00:32:14,553
What do you remember?

215
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,729
I didn't remember anything,
but your question makes me think.

216
00:32:19,098 --> 00:32:21,532
I've never been in love.

217
00:32:21,848 --> 00:32:25,397
I have.
I cried because of you for 22 years.

218
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,592
We would have been
a beautiful couple.

219
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:36,989
It's not a good idea
to say that now!

220
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:39,612
It doesn't please or
comfort me anymore.

221
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:44,554
For 22 years you fucked me,
once a month,

222
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,411
always the same way.

223
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:52,246
You won't believe me,

224
00:32:52,574 --> 00:32:56,481
but thanks God
I'm still a virgin.

225
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:42,463
I wish you that you get
100 years old. Damiana

226
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:02,372
You have an appointment
in the cathedral!

227
00:34:02,705 --> 00:34:07,904
We know, you're up there!
Come out!

228
00:34:08,405 --> 00:34:11,630
If you can't behave like a gentleman,
show at least you're a man!

229
00:34:11,993 --> 00:34:15,267
She trusts you, and is waiting.
You'll pay for this!

230
00:34:15,655 --> 00:34:17,468
Ximena cries in the cathedral!

231
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:34,224
With this column...

232
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:39,879
I add a happy end...

233
00:34:41,197 --> 00:34:45,955
to a long and straight life.

234
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,049
Who's there?

235
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:52,401
What happened to the girl?

236
00:34:52,992 --> 00:34:54,220
Nothing.

237
00:34:55,068 --> 00:34:57,161
You didn't even wake her up?

238
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:01,311
A woman will never forgive the man,
who doesn't honour her début.

239
00:35:05,401 --> 00:35:08,720
Maybe she just played sleeping
out of fear?

240
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:11,802
She rather thinks
that you're unable.

241
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:14,778
I wouldn't like it leaks out.

242
00:35:15,107 --> 00:35:20,579
I don't care. She is in such
a pathetic condition,

243
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:25,574
that no one will believe her,
neither sleeping nor awake.

244
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:28,551
I could make her
return the money.

245
00:35:29,023 --> 00:35:33,492
Forget it!
No harm is done.

246
00:35:33,896 --> 00:35:38,587
It helped me realize that I'm
not up for these things anymore.

247
00:35:39,478 --> 00:35:43,608
Anyway, the girl is right.
I'm finished!

248
00:35:50,268 --> 00:35:54,420
Thank you for the 90 years.

249
00:36:06,904 --> 00:36:10,485
Reception of visitors
in the printing hall.

250
00:36:39,176 --> 00:36:42,691
My dear Don Jerónimo,
You shouldn't...

251
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:47,142
I know. It is only
a little compensation

252
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:52,954
for all the words I have censored out.
from your columns over the years.

253
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:55,974
A censor does only
what his work is.

254
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,015
With Gods help!

255
00:37:16,044 --> 00:37:18,353
You are a man
in his prime.

256
00:37:18,668 --> 00:37:21,819
Thank you, Don Tulio. Almost. Almost.

257
00:37:22,168 --> 00:37:23,999
Where's your column?

258
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:28,776
- This time there's none.
- Are you kidding?

259
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,039
I'm sorry, señor.

260
00:37:32,874 --> 00:37:34,102
Impossible!

261
00:37:35,874 --> 00:37:39,105
Think of it
as an exception, please.

262
00:37:39,415 --> 00:37:44,284
I had a difficult night
and woke up numb.

263
00:37:45,247 --> 00:37:47,850
Then you should have
written about it.

264
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:52,555
The readers would enjoy
to learn how life is with 90.

265
00:37:52,953 --> 00:37:55,865
Perhaps it's
a delightful mystery.

266
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:58,629
Apparently she marked you
immediately.

267
00:38:00,035 --> 00:38:05,244
How beautiful!
You still blush so elegantly.

268
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:10,182
It has certainly been
a phenomenal night. I envy her.

269
00:38:13,075 --> 00:38:15,509
What I said before, was a joke.

270
00:38:16,366 --> 00:38:18,955
- Here you are.
- I knew it!

271
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:23,293
I knew you wouldn't
abandon me!

272
00:38:23,573 --> 00:38:24,930
Bravo, young man!

273
00:39:05,017 --> 00:39:07,785
It would be wonderful with you,

274
00:39:08,778 --> 00:39:10,361
because I need it.

275
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:41,005
Promise me that you
marry a white woman.

276
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:45,710
And that you'll have
at least three children.

277
00:39:46,641 --> 00:39:49,394
The girl you call Florina,

278
00:39:49,682 --> 00:39:51,434
just like me,

279
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:54,195
like my mother and
my grandmother.

280
00:39:55,972 --> 00:39:57,769
Will you do that for me?

281
00:40:05,263 --> 00:40:07,538
I'm happy about
the newspaper today,

282
00:40:07,845 --> 00:40:10,518
because I thought
you were 100 and not 90.

283
00:40:11,012 --> 00:40:12,923
Do you see me so weak?

284
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,414
But no!

285
00:40:14,636 --> 00:40:16,752
I was surprised how young
you still look.

286
00:40:17,844 --> 00:40:20,644
So good that you aren't
one of these dirty old men,

287
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:24,295
who play older so people think
they are still in good shape.

288
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:27,056
I have a gift for you.

289
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:28,809
What is it?

290
00:40:29,758 --> 00:40:30,793
The girl.

291
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,098
Thanks, that's over.

292
00:40:37,131 --> 00:40:40,168
I'll send her to your home,
wrapped in silk paper,

293
00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:43,740
warmed in a lukewarm
herbal bath with sandalwood.

294
00:40:45,047 --> 00:40:46,241
All for free!

295
00:40:46,505 --> 00:40:48,063
Don't you dare.

296
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:50,490
You're right.

297
00:40:51,504 --> 00:40:54,204
The girl was in a
poor condition yesterday,

298
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:59,031
because she had sewn on 200 buttons
with needle and thimble before.

299
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:05,352
And she was actually afraid that
it might become a bloody rape.

300
00:41:06,293 --> 00:41:08,568
But now she's prepared
for the sacrifice.

301
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:10,187
Better for her.

302
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:13,186
You may be interested,

303
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:16,656
that the girl got up at night,
to go to the bathroom,

304
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:21,031
but you slept so deep that
she didn't want to wake you up.

305
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,863
Why are you wasting both yours
and my time with silly lies?

306
00:41:26,415 --> 00:41:27,564
The truth is,

307
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:30,861
that she woke up in the morning
and you were gone.

308
00:41:31,163 --> 00:41:32,801
The girl regrets.

309
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:36,820
Poor her, she's at my place.

310
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:38,970
I don't believe you.

311
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:41,837
Shall I sent her to you?

312
00:41:42,286 --> 00:41:43,924
Damn, no!

313
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:45,896
No!

314
00:41:58,117 --> 00:42:00,108
Typical censor Ortega.

315
00:42:02,324 --> 00:42:03,677
This is absurd.

316
00:42:05,074 --> 00:42:09,033
And what can I say?
You speak of justice?

317
00:42:09,906 --> 00:42:11,897
After so many years, please.

318
00:42:14,614 --> 00:42:18,812
Then I'm glad that
you listened to my protest.

319
00:42:19,322 --> 00:42:20,675
Goodbye.

320
00:42:27,653 --> 00:42:30,042
The crosses are not added by me.

321
00:42:30,944 --> 00:42:33,014
I find them tasteless.

322
00:42:41,484 --> 00:42:42,963
Allow me to say,

323
00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:45,660
that you're the most indispensable
man I know.

324
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:48,030
I'm talking about
your termination.

325
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,818
Finished is finished.

326
00:42:51,065 --> 00:42:52,703
No Maestro.

327
00:42:54,023 --> 00:42:55,903
Didn't you read the newspapers?

328
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:59,098
So you ignore that your column
didn't appear?

329
00:42:59,397 --> 00:43:01,069
It wasn't published?

330
00:43:01,355 --> 00:43:02,629
No!

331
00:43:03,441 --> 00:43:08,073
Don Jeronimo used his red pencil
all the way through it.

332
00:43:08,479 --> 00:43:10,754
But in private,
I can tell you

333
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,739
that I am grateful for the
censor's mercilessness.

334
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:16,529
As long as you can hold
a feather

335
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:20,612
and use your typewriter,
we want you to go on.

336
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:25,921
You are a star among
our columnists and critics,

337
00:43:26,267 --> 00:43:28,504
since you were almost a child,

338
00:43:29,308 --> 00:43:32,489
We don't want that this star
burns out too early.

339
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:38,139
I urge you,
Don't leave the ship at sea.

340
00:43:48,097 --> 00:43:53,046
The Archduke Franz Ferdinand
of Austria-Hungary

341
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:57,862
and his wife, the Archduchess,

342
00:44:03,636 --> 00:44:09,074
were killed yesterday by gunfire,

343
00:44:12,009 --> 00:44:15,160
while they visited Sarajevo.

344
00:45:26,995 --> 00:45:30,305
Good evening. How are you?
What's new, Maestro?

345
00:45:32,036 --> 00:45:35,631
The heir apparent
of Austria-Hungary is no more.

346
00:45:35,952 --> 00:45:40,025
- What do you mean?
- They were murdered yesterday.

347
00:45:40,368 --> 00:45:42,279
What does that mean for us?

348
00:45:43,617 --> 00:45:47,656
Regardless of who you are,
death can get you anywhere.

349
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:49,638
That's not new.

350
00:45:51,532 --> 00:45:54,046
No, but it's good to know.

351
00:46:25,567 --> 00:46:26,795
Casilda!

352
00:46:27,734 --> 00:46:29,008
Casilda!

353
00:46:32,816 --> 00:46:34,534
I'm busy!

354
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:45,456
My brother is not joking.
He's attacking us.

355
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:51,121
I tell you, girl, I know
the governor very good.

356
00:46:51,521 --> 00:46:54,593
If I want I can move people.

357
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:59,571
I can get them killed.

358
00:47:00,187 --> 00:47:05,376
We're planning to let
someone disappear.

359
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:09,504
Don't you like your Casilda?

360
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:11,120
You'll see...

361
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:13,659
Of course I like my Casilda!

362
00:47:14,767 --> 00:47:17,281
But I forgot that tonight...

363
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:22,691
I'll come back tomorrow.

364
00:47:22,932 --> 00:47:24,763
I must go now.

365
00:47:27,473 --> 00:47:28,701
Another time.

366
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,692
Ximena!

367
00:47:42,304 --> 00:47:45,262
I've been dreaming
of this moment.

368
00:47:46,678 --> 00:47:48,509
Funny you should say that.

369
00:47:49,636 --> 00:47:51,592
And who are you?

370
00:47:54,218 --> 00:47:58,496
I think she recognizes you,
but she doesn't remember.

371
00:48:21,671 --> 00:48:24,331
What do you have in the basket?
- A cat.

372
00:48:25,004 --> 00:48:26,323
May I see it?

373
00:48:30,586 --> 00:48:32,065
Little Tiger.

374
00:48:33,502 --> 00:48:34,855
How old is she?

375
00:48:36,335 --> 00:48:38,855
Dont know.
She was just given me.

376
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:42,243
Because she looks very old.
Like ten years or so.

377
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:46,720
I think she was exposed
and has experienced a lot.

378
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:48,687
What is your work?

379
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:53,058
I'm a journalist.

380
00:48:53,456 --> 00:48:56,184
- For how long already?
- For a century.

381
00:48:58,622 --> 00:49:01,898
Take care of yourself.
You aren't 18 anymore.

382
00:49:02,955 --> 00:49:07,153
Thank you for reminding me.
I had forgotten it.

383
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:50,517
Girl! Your bracelet!

384
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:21,382
Delgadina...

385
00:50:30,439 --> 00:50:31,952
It's good, wife.

386
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:35,868
It's good, wife!

387
00:50:39,313 --> 00:50:41,986
Sorry for the rage recently.

388
00:50:42,312 --> 00:50:46,544
Don't worry.
I knew you'd call.

389
00:50:48,435 --> 00:50:53,270
I want that the girl awaits me
like God created her.

390
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:55,117
As you wish.

391
00:50:57,392 --> 00:50:59,428
But you'll miss the pleasure...

392
00:51:00,517 --> 00:51:02,587
to undress her
piece by piece,

393
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:05,728
like old men love to do,
for whatever reason.

394
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,427
But I know it.
- Why?

395
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,552
Because every time
they get a little older.

396
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:21,764
Then tonight at 10 clock.
Before the little fish gets cold.

397
00:52:22,544 --> 00:52:28,222
The virgin in her head...

398
00:52:31,917 --> 00:52:37,275
carried her along on a litter,

399
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:43,783
the bells of joy...

400
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:51,733
tolled for Delgadina.

401
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:56,179
Delgadina,

402
00:52:57,662 --> 00:52:59,095
my girl

403
00:53:00,078 --> 00:53:01,716
that you are for me.

404
00:53:08,743 --> 00:53:12,452
THE TIGER
EATS NOT FAR FROM HERE

405
00:54:25,271 --> 00:54:26,784
Is anyone here?

406
00:54:29,978 --> 00:54:31,730
I'm not talking to you.

407
00:54:33,769 --> 00:54:36,727
Why are you so old already?

408
00:54:39,935 --> 00:54:45,293
How old you are has nothing to do with
how long you have lived,

409
00:54:45,684 --> 00:54:48,881
but how long you intend
to continue living.

410
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:06,846
Now I know
that it wasn't a hallucination,

411
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:12,904
but another miracle...

412
00:55:15,387 --> 00:55:18,584
the first love of my life...

413
00:55:20,011 --> 00:55:23,526
at the age of 90.

414
00:55:24,718 --> 00:55:28,393
I don't understand how you can spend
two nights with this child,

415
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:30,158
without touching her.

416
00:55:31,967 --> 00:55:36,324
Sex is just the consolation,
if you can't experience love.

417
00:55:36,716 --> 00:55:38,672
It's your right not
to like her,

418
00:55:38,965 --> 00:55:42,116
but damn behave
like an adult.

419
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:45,020
The case isn't that simple.

420
00:55:45,881 --> 00:55:48,031
I'd have another one for you,

421
00:55:48,339 --> 00:55:49,613
a little older,

422
00:55:51,213 --> 00:55:53,522
also a virgin, good looking.

423
00:55:53,796 --> 00:55:56,404
Her father wants to swap her
for a house.

424
00:55:57,066 --> 00:56:00,501
But we will certainly
get a discount.

425
00:56:00,878 --> 00:56:02,391
Shut up!

426
00:56:02,628 --> 00:56:06,018
I want that girl again
and I want her always.

427
00:56:06,336 --> 00:56:09,567
Without fail, without dispute
nor bad memories.

428
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:11,245
Good.

429
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:17,181
That must be what the doctors call
... senile dementia.

430
00:56:21,332 --> 00:56:23,050
Senile dementia.

431
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:02,821
My mother owned them,

432
00:57:06,616 --> 00:57:09,369
and before her my grandmother,

433
00:57:10,491 --> 00:57:13,449
and long before that
my great-grandmother.

434
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:16,457
I want you to wear them.

435
00:57:37,527 --> 00:57:39,722
There's a picture on the wall.

436
00:57:41,276 --> 00:57:43,107
It's painted by Figurita.

437
00:57:43,401 --> 00:57:45,471
A man we really liked.

438
00:57:46,651 --> 00:57:50,121
The best brothel dancer
that ever existed.

439
00:57:51,816 --> 00:57:55,445
And so good-hearted,
that he pitied the devil.

440
00:57:57,315 --> 00:58:00,227
The woman in the picture
is a nun.

441
00:58:01,981 --> 00:58:06,372
Figurita abducted her from
a monastery and married her.

442
00:58:08,771 --> 00:58:10,762
I leave it here,

443
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,615
so it is the first thing
you see when you wake up.

444
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:19,635
I tell my readers,

445
00:58:20,394 --> 00:58:26,072
I float between
wandering clouds,

446
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:36,730
carried by the love,
I feel for you,

447
00:58:37,474 --> 00:58:42,707
with an extraordinary intensity,

448
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:49,375
I haven't known in my
life previously.

449
00:58:50,847 --> 00:58:54,237
We've never published
hand-written texts. You know that.

450
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,519
The idea is absurd!

451
00:58:56,763 --> 00:59:01,598
This isn't a conventional column.
These are love letters.

452
00:59:02,012 --> 00:59:04,207
Love letters that everybody
can relate to.

453
00:59:05,177 --> 00:59:07,566
Make no mistake, Marco Tulio.

454
00:59:07,843 --> 00:59:11,631
The gentle savages own the future.

455
00:59:38,047 --> 00:59:40,561
I think it was Delgadina, who...

456
00:59:40,838 --> 00:59:42,112
Delgadina?

457
00:59:42,629 --> 00:59:45,382
That isn't the girl's name...
- Don't tell me.

458
00:59:46,504 --> 00:59:49,780
Well, finally she's yours.

459
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:54,974
I've never seen her face
and I don't know her real name.

460
00:59:55,335 --> 00:59:56,893
For me she's Delgadina.

461
00:59:58,377 --> 01:00:00,034
It sounds like anorexia.

462
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:04,085
I think it was Delgadina,

463
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:08,645
who wrote that verse about the tiger
on the bathroom mirror.

464
01:00:08,999 --> 01:00:10,049
What verse?

465
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:13,221
"The tiger doesn't eat
far from here. "

466
01:00:13,498 --> 01:00:17,571
No, she can't have done it.
She can neither read nor write.

467
01:00:17,956 --> 01:00:19,071
Who then?

468
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:21,267
Maybe...

469
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,536
someone who died
in that room.

470
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:30,179
I don't need a full moon,
to set my bum on fire tonight...

471
01:00:30,579 --> 01:00:32,171
Don't complain now!

472
01:00:32,412 --> 01:00:36,087
Be happy that you still
have a butt that can burn!

473
01:00:37,244 --> 01:00:39,200
Why don't you marry her?

474
01:00:40,327 --> 01:00:43,080
You live already together
practically.

475
01:00:43,618 --> 01:00:45,813
It will be cheaper
for you.

476
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:49,662
To be good or not
is the question at your age,

477
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,180
but you said it's too late
for you.

478
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:54,150
I've never been married.

479
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:57,766
Your beautiful eyes
didn't give me time for it.

480
01:01:09,238 --> 01:01:14,837
I have a funny feeling that Delgadina
will grow up before her time.

481
01:01:16,278 --> 01:01:17,996
That is normal.

482
01:01:18,236 --> 01:01:20,113
A flower must blossom.

483
01:01:20,361 --> 01:01:21,635
Sooner or later.

484
01:01:23,277 --> 01:01:25,586
In one week is her birthday.

485
01:01:27,402 --> 01:01:30,599
I never thought about
that angels have a birthday.

486
01:02:02,145 --> 01:02:03,737
Delgadina,

487
01:02:05,811 --> 01:02:08,371
we are alone in this world.

488
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:14,549
The elderly know best
how to love, my Delgadina,

489
01:02:14,893 --> 01:02:17,532
because they have
nothing else to do.

490
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:21,438
The young ones on the other hand
at the beginning of their life,

491
01:02:21,766 --> 01:02:23,085
care about their work,

492
01:02:23,808 --> 01:02:26,163
about success and money.

493
01:02:26,432 --> 01:02:30,141
For the elderly all that
isn't important anymore.

494
01:02:30,473 --> 01:02:33,351
The past is forgotten.

495
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:38,474
What remains is nostalgia,
which is as pointless as sorrow

496
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,645
and love,
if it appears by chance.

497
01:02:46,845 --> 01:02:52,397
Never again, I will wake up
with a bitter taste.

498
01:02:56,260 --> 01:03:01,698
Never again, I will say I have
missed an experience.

499
01:03:02,134 --> 01:03:04,887
And as long as my lips
can say "Thank you",

500
01:03:05,175 --> 01:03:08,531
I will always honour,
what you have taught me.

501
01:03:08,841 --> 01:03:13,835
Me, who has written and spoken
about everything in the world.

502
01:03:14,215 --> 01:03:16,524
But misunderstood
the essence.

503
01:03:17,256 --> 01:03:21,249
- What is it, Mary?
- Who is this Delgadina in reality?

504
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,223
I don't believe she exists.

505
01:03:23,505 --> 01:03:26,736
Sure she exists,
but she lives in another town.

506
01:03:29,421 --> 01:03:32,811
You have no right to speak,
if no one asks you.

507
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,888
Why do you think
she is from another city?

508
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:39,287
Because he wouldn't dare to publish
love letters in the newspaper,

509
01:03:39,586 --> 01:03:42,100
if we could meet her in
the street.

510
01:03:43,168 --> 01:03:46,319
- Where were you with the cat?
- At the vet.

511
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:51,037
- For what?
- The cat is ill.

512
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:53,485
And?

513
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:58,750
They want to euthanize her,
but they need you must agree.

514
01:03:59,123 --> 01:04:02,718
- Why do they want to kill her?
- Because she is very old.

515
01:04:03,997 --> 01:04:06,272
Well, do you agree?

516
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:11,492
I ask you, whether you agree,
that they euthanize her?

517
01:04:11,788 --> 01:04:13,779
No!

518
01:04:15,496 --> 01:04:19,455
You can kill her she is
threatening public health.

519
01:04:19,787 --> 01:04:21,743
But not because she is old.

520
01:04:27,785 --> 01:04:30,618
For a long time I slept early,

521
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:36,616
and when I woke up in middle of
the night, I didn't know where I was,

522
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:42,316
and for a moment
not even who I was.

523
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:45,685
Unfortunately, after eating,

524
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:48,985
I saw myself obliged,
immediately to leave my mother,

525
01:04:49,281 --> 01:04:54,516
who tattled with the others in the
garden if it was a balmy night,

526
01:04:55,946 --> 01:05:00,861
or in a small room, where they gathered
when the weather was bad.

527
01:05:02,195 --> 01:05:06,029
My only consolation was,
when I went upstairs to sleep,

528
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:09,273
that mom would come
to give me a kiss,

529
01:05:09,569 --> 01:05:11,639
when I lay in bed.

530
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:17,060
It was Isabel, who made
the snails cry.

531
01:05:20,484 --> 01:05:21,963
Whose were they?

532
01:05:42,937 --> 01:05:44,450
My poor son.

533
01:05:53,311 --> 01:05:57,224
Get dressed and come with me.
I have a serious problem.

534
01:06:12,516 --> 01:06:14,188
Isn't that J. M. B?

535
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,756
Help me dress him.

536
01:06:22,014 --> 01:06:24,926
Nothing is more difficult
than to dressing corpse.

537
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:30,526
This isn't the first time I do it.
Someone must hold him.

538
01:06:30,928 --> 01:06:34,716
Who could be convinced by
a body stabbed to death

539
01:06:35,053 --> 01:06:39,092
in the suit of an
English gentleman?

540
01:06:58,174 --> 01:07:02,406
- You are trembling.
- Because of her, Delgadina.

541
01:07:02,756 --> 01:07:06,305
- Best you take her with you.
- You know I can't.

542
01:07:06,631 --> 01:07:09,813
Then tell her to disappear
before someone comes.

543
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:11,262
I will.

544
01:07:13,463 --> 01:07:15,977
Nothing will happen a journalist.

545
01:07:16,254 --> 01:07:17,607
Not you either.

546
01:07:17,837 --> 01:07:21,487
You're the only liberal, who has
influence on the government.

547
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:42,659
Delgadina!

548
01:07:43,624 --> 01:07:44,818
Delgadina!

549
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,712
Be quiet, sage!

550
01:07:49,414 --> 01:07:52,611
The girl isn't there,
She's gone.

551
01:07:52,914 --> 01:07:54,108
Better that way.

552
01:07:55,955 --> 01:07:57,866
Best you disappear also...

553
01:07:58,121 --> 01:08:00,521
Silence!
Do you know what time it is?

554
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,023
You're right.

555
01:08:06,537 --> 01:08:07,970
She don't suit you.

556
01:08:16,701 --> 01:08:20,250
- Is everything made up?
- According to my sources, yes.

557
01:08:20,908 --> 01:08:22,307
Good.

558
01:08:22,741 --> 01:08:25,892
If your sources are
really trustworthy,

559
01:08:27,115 --> 01:08:28,025
Well...

560
01:08:28,282 --> 01:08:30,000
This is the truth:

561
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:35,942
The young banker
wasn't murdered by rebels,

562
01:08:36,322 --> 01:08:41,760
as they believed erroneously,
but by someone who knew him well.

563
01:08:46,848 --> 01:08:49,032
THE TRUTH ABOUT
THE KILLING OF THE BANKER

564
01:09:03,609 --> 01:09:08,239
Life is sad,
if we live without an illusion.

565
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:27,118
Have you seen the señora? - No.

566
01:09:28,646 --> 01:09:30,841
Sorry,
have you seen the señora?

567
01:09:31,104 --> 01:09:34,335
No, señor. We haven't heard
from her for a long time.

568
01:09:34,687 --> 01:09:36,484
Have you seen the señora?

569
01:09:36,728 --> 01:09:38,002
No. Really.

570
01:09:38,639 --> 01:09:42,922
Sage, why don't you moderate
your letters a little?

571
01:09:43,268 --> 01:09:47,659
While we think about how we comfort
all those readers who are in love.

572
01:09:52,142 --> 01:09:54,895
Are you ill, maestro?
- No.

573
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,397
But I'm sick.

574
01:09:59,557 --> 01:10:00,876
Sick with love.

575
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,893
Two unidentified corpses
of young girls are found

576
01:10:04,223 --> 01:10:06,532
in the Amphitheatre.
- How old?

577
01:10:06,848 --> 01:10:08,167
They are very young.

578
01:10:08,389 --> 01:10:11,108
Maybe refugees
be from the inland,

579
01:10:11,388 --> 01:10:13,982
hunted by the butchers
of the regime.

580
01:10:14,262 --> 01:10:19,017
The condition invades us
silently to us stain with blood.

581
01:10:19,428 --> 01:10:21,066
Not with blood, maestro.

582
01:10:21,553 --> 01:10:23,305
With shit!

583
01:10:40,925 --> 01:10:42,244
What do you want?

584
01:10:44,299 --> 01:10:47,177
You wouldn't have done
that to me, Delgadina.

585
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:24,236
Damiana!

586
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:27,111
Take off your clothes
and roll around with me.

587
01:11:27,348 --> 01:11:29,608
What do you do
if I say yes?

588
01:11:37,747 --> 01:11:42,901
Your eyes have the same colour
as Delgadina's when she's angry.

589
01:11:44,246 --> 01:11:48,080
Maybe you can help me
to find her.

590
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:54,841
Take it easy.

591
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:58,011
Come, come, come.

592
01:12:03,659 --> 01:12:06,253
One, two...

593
01:12:15,074 --> 01:12:16,393
Who's there?

594
01:12:16,615 --> 01:12:18,287
A friend.

595
01:12:18,531 --> 01:12:21,523
- I'm looking for the owner.
- There's no owner.

596
01:12:22,614 --> 01:12:25,447
Open the door at least,
so I can get my cat.

597
01:12:25,738 --> 01:12:27,137
There's no cat.

598
01:12:28,113 --> 01:12:30,343
- Who are you?
- No one.

599
01:12:38,486 --> 01:12:41,284
- How old was the girl?
- Maximum 16.

600
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:44,887
- No, 15 at most.
- And how did she look like?

601
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,424
- Why do you ask?
- I'm a journalist.

602
01:12:47,735 --> 01:12:50,807
- She was tall and thin.
- Short, curly hair.

603
01:13:05,106 --> 01:13:10,738
Is there a young girl here
who had a bicycle accident?

604
01:13:11,147 --> 01:13:15,425
Yes, half an hour ago.
Can you identify her?

605
01:13:15,771 --> 01:13:17,648
- Maybe.
- Follow me.

606
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:24,411
I... I'm not the one
you are looking for.

607
01:13:49,848 --> 01:13:52,999
What would I've done,
if she had been there?

608
01:14:21,301 --> 01:14:22,859
Excuse me, señor.

609
01:14:23,134 --> 01:14:26,649
Is it you who writes the love letters
in the newspaper?

610
01:15:24,539 --> 01:15:25,813
Are you back?

611
01:15:39,203 --> 01:15:40,477
Are you back?

612
01:15:44,576 --> 01:15:46,931
- Yes, I'm back.
- Where were you?

613
01:15:47,493 --> 01:15:49,165
Take it easy!

614
01:15:49,409 --> 01:15:52,128
I gave myself a break,
in Cartagena de Indias.

615
01:15:52,408 --> 01:15:54,717
- And she?
- You shall take it easy.

616
01:15:55,033 --> 01:15:57,433
- You have to wait.
- How long?

617
01:15:57,658 --> 01:16:01,571
- No idea. I'll let you know.
- Wait! Give me a hint.

618
01:16:01,949 --> 01:16:03,223
I have no hint.

619
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:05,162
- Damn it!
- Be careful!

620
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:08,580
You could harm yourself,
but worse you could harm her.

621
01:16:08,822 --> 01:16:11,734
Give me at least an idea
of what's going on.

622
01:16:12,072 --> 01:16:14,506
After all, we are accomplices.
Or not?

623
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:15,780
Calm down.

624
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:18,176
She's fine, she's waiting
for my call.

625
01:16:18,446 --> 01:16:20,184
Right now that's all.

626
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:22,363
I won't say more!

627
01:17:13,019 --> 01:17:14,372
Shit!

628
01:17:20,351 --> 01:17:22,660
Today is the day.

629
01:18:21,215 --> 01:18:22,728
Whore!

630
01:18:30,962 --> 01:18:32,315
My God!

631
01:18:42,669 --> 01:18:44,148
Let's go!

632
01:18:52,084 --> 01:18:55,599
Now behave yourself like an adult.
What's wrong with you?

633
01:18:55,917 --> 01:18:59,067
Everything has become clear for me,
Señora Cabarcas.

634
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:04,123
You have sold Delgadina's virginity
to one of your influential customers,

635
01:19:04,998 --> 01:19:08,195
so that you go free
for the crime.

636
01:19:08,498 --> 01:19:13,652
And then, a honeymoon threesome.
The other two in bed,

637
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:19,393
and you on the luxurious patio,
happy about your impunity.

638
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:21,107
Marvelous!

639
01:19:22,121 --> 01:19:25,875
Jealousy always knows
more than the truth.

640
01:19:26,202 --> 01:19:28,432
But the truth is different.

641
01:19:28,702 --> 01:19:30,932
I was alone in
Cartagena de Indias,

642
01:19:31,201 --> 01:19:34,671
while the scandal cooled down.
I came back yesterday.

643
01:19:34,992 --> 01:19:38,064
The girl came at once to me,
in such a poor condition,

644
01:19:38,367 --> 01:19:42,155
I bathed her for you, dressed her
and sent her to the beauty salon.

645
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:47,087
Her jewelry and clothes
are just cheap imitations!

646
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:50,964
Bawd and whore!
That's what you are!

647
01:19:51,323 --> 01:19:53,200
Damn it!

648
01:19:53,448 --> 01:19:58,044
Sage, go and look for the girl,
beg her pardon

649
01:19:58,359 --> 01:20:00,752
and take care of her,
for now and forever.

650
01:20:00,977 --> 01:20:03,068
No one deserves more
to be happy.

651
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:05,156
Fucking bitches!

652
01:20:05,404 --> 01:20:07,474
I don't want to know
you anymore,

653
01:20:07,779 --> 01:20:09,576
or any other whore

654
01:20:09,862 --> 01:20:12,092
and least of all her!

655
01:20:14,153 --> 01:20:15,871
Farewell forever!

656
01:20:19,984 --> 01:20:21,656
God be with you.

657
01:20:24,483 --> 01:20:26,041
Sage!

658
01:20:28,483 --> 01:20:29,802
Sage!

659
01:20:30,336 --> 01:20:32,116
I'll send the bill

660
01:20:32,315 --> 01:20:34,262
for the mess in the room.

661
01:20:35,273 --> 01:20:37,833
It'll cost you dearly!

662
01:20:42,855 --> 01:20:46,006
I inherited them
from my mother.

663
01:20:46,771 --> 01:20:50,366
I've had them for
more than 60 years.

664
01:20:57,478 --> 01:21:01,437
They have been purchased here
more than 100 years ago,

665
01:21:04,227 --> 01:21:05,501
Please wait.

666
01:21:23,931 --> 01:21:26,729
Don't tell your father,
that we've been here.

667
01:21:30,388 --> 01:21:34,859
In this business it's important that
each purchase is recorded.

668
01:21:36,345 --> 01:21:41,908
On February 7th 1882 has your mother,
Florina de Dios Cargamantos,

669
01:21:44,052 --> 01:21:49,684
exchanged the mounted stones
in her earrings for imitations,

670
01:21:51,259 --> 01:21:56,128
and sold the originals
to us for 20 pesos.

671
01:21:58,258 --> 01:22:03,048
At least gold is gold
platinum and platinum.

672
01:22:03,424 --> 01:22:05,960
We can offer you...
- No thanks.

673
01:22:07,174 --> 01:22:08,543
I'll keep them,

674
01:22:08,724 --> 01:22:12,105
in memory of an other
Florina de Dios,

675
01:22:12,422 --> 01:22:14,253
whom I never met.

676
01:22:18,046 --> 01:22:19,320
Mom!

677
01:22:32,585 --> 01:22:34,416
Now I'm an old man.

678
01:22:37,709 --> 01:22:38,903
Mother,

679
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:42,443
I always believed
that dying of love

680
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:45,025
happened only in poetry.

681
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:50,886
But today I found out
that it's not only possible,

682
01:22:52,332 --> 01:22:57,248
but that I myself,
old and lonely,

683
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:00,356
am dying of love.

684
01:23:01,413 --> 01:23:03,847
And I would have told you,
mother,

685
01:23:04,163 --> 01:23:07,606
that I wouldn't exchange

686
01:23:07,873 --> 01:23:11,532
the pleasure of my pain
for anything in the world.

687
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:55,253
Are you still doing it?

688
01:23:57,903 --> 01:24:03,036
I've had trouble to remember names
and faces for years now.

689
01:24:03,818 --> 01:24:07,891
But yours, Casilda Armenta,

690
01:24:09,567 --> 01:24:11,398
I will never forget.

691
01:24:11,983 --> 01:24:14,133
Not even after 40 years?

692
01:24:16,191 --> 01:24:18,760
Not even after 40 years.

693
01:24:30,063 --> 01:24:31,493
What are you doing here?

694
01:24:34,604 --> 01:24:36,595
I escape from myself.

695
01:24:38,854 --> 01:24:40,333
You look sad.

696
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,112
I am.

697
01:24:44,894 --> 01:24:46,373
Come home with me.

698
01:24:50,003 --> 01:24:52,425
Whenever you are mentioned
on the radio,

699
01:24:52,650 --> 01:24:56,316
they pay tribute to you, because
people admire you so much.

700
01:24:56,891 --> 01:25:00,042
They call you "Master of Love".

701
01:25:00,766 --> 01:25:02,802
Imagine.

702
01:25:03,057 --> 01:25:07,653
I think no one knew your charm
and your quirks as well as I do.

703
01:25:08,014 --> 01:25:09,652
Seriously,

704
01:25:09,889 --> 01:25:12,119
no one could have
tolerated more.

705
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:14,580
The truth is that I'm getting old.

706
01:25:14,972 --> 01:25:16,246
Yes.

707
01:25:16,846 --> 01:25:18,165
Your body.

708
01:25:19,952 --> 01:25:24,041
But from what you tell me,
you're still a young man inside.

709
01:25:25,803 --> 01:25:27,919
Do what you want.

710
01:25:28,178 --> 01:25:30,567
But do not lose
that spirit.

711
01:25:32,219 --> 01:25:35,768
There is no bigger misfortune
than to die alone,

712
01:25:36,926 --> 01:25:38,245
Isn't it so?

713
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:40,776
It's enough.

714
01:25:43,759 --> 01:25:45,829
It's enough, woman.

715
01:25:50,716 --> 01:25:51,910
Woman!

716
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:54,155
Today is the day.

717
01:25:54,422 --> 01:25:57,573
I haven't seen the girl
for more than a month.

718
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,917
But she must have recovered
from the shock that night,

719
01:26:01,213 --> 01:26:04,125
because she has
found a new job

720
01:26:04,421 --> 01:26:07,618
More pleasant and better paid
than sewing on buttons.

721
01:26:08,295 --> 01:26:10,650
That can only mean
as a whore.

722
01:26:11,253 --> 01:26:12,845
As a whore?

723
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:14,724
Then she'd be here.

724
01:26:15,794 --> 01:26:17,785
How should I know
she's not here?

725
01:26:18,252 --> 01:26:21,801
In this case it's better
if you don't know.

726
01:26:22,126 --> 01:26:23,036
Or is it?

727
01:26:23,459 --> 01:26:26,769
It would have been best
for the sage,

728
01:26:27,084 --> 01:26:31,680
if he had never met
madam Rosa Cabarcas!

729
01:26:35,416 --> 01:26:37,771
I'll look for her, I promise.

730
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:41,077
It's difficult but it
will not kill me.

731
01:26:41,373 --> 01:26:44,331
Wait and you'll see.

732
01:27:02,785 --> 01:27:04,457
My poor son.

733
01:27:05,576 --> 01:27:07,019
I bless you.

734
01:27:07,493 --> 01:27:09,893
This is the wrong moment,
mother!

735
01:27:22,198 --> 01:27:23,631
Have you found her?

736
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:26,639
Not yet.

737
01:27:27,906 --> 01:27:30,739
But I think I will
before the day ends.

738
01:27:39,029 --> 01:27:40,621
If you find her...

739
01:27:41,737 --> 01:27:43,295
Remember:

740
01:27:43,819 --> 01:27:47,778
If you find her, forget all
grandfatherly sentimentality.

741
01:27:49,235 --> 01:27:50,714
Wake her up,

742
01:27:51,818 --> 01:27:55,731
and fuck her good and proper
with your donkey dick

743
01:27:56,067 --> 01:28:00,618
that the devil rewarded you with
for your cowardice and pettiness.

744
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:04,903
Honestly. Don't die before
you've experienced the miracle,

745
01:28:05,232 --> 01:28:07,143
to fuck out of love.

746
01:28:14,814 --> 01:28:16,213
We'll see.

747
01:28:23,396 --> 01:28:25,352
Bring me my girl tonight!

748
01:28:28,728 --> 01:28:29,956
That's impossible.

749
01:28:31,394 --> 01:28:34,033
Tonight,
for the Holy Father's sake.

750
01:28:34,352 --> 01:28:36,024
Impossible.

751
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:55,085
Well, here you have her.

752
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:57,910
She wants to me?

753
01:28:58,347 --> 01:29:00,144
You has to meet you,

754
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:04,309
- Does she agree?
- She must agree.

755
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:06,931
What do you mean?

756
01:29:07,804 --> 01:29:11,558
Don't they call you the sage?
Don't be so stupid.

757
01:29:12,137 --> 01:29:13,331
I'm not.

758
01:29:13,595 --> 01:29:15,267
Then you're blind.

759
01:29:17,177 --> 01:29:20,294
Don't you see the girl's
quite crazy with love for you?

760
01:29:23,801 --> 01:29:25,917
Let's make a deal,

761
01:29:27,592 --> 01:29:28,961
notarized.

762
01:29:35,423 --> 01:29:38,779
The one who survives,
inherits everything from the other.

763
01:29:40,672 --> 01:29:41,946
No.

764
01:29:42,381 --> 01:29:46,852
Because when I die,
everything should go to the girl.

765
01:29:48,671 --> 01:29:50,151
The girl doesn't count.

766
01:29:50,338 --> 01:29:54,854
I take care of the girl and bequeath
her everything, yours and mine.

767
01:29:55,212 --> 01:29:57,885
I have no one else
in this world.

768
01:32:24,434 --> 01:32:26,868
I'm crazy out of love!

769
01:32:27,933 --> 01:32:30,970
Not crazy, demented!

770
01:32:35,724 --> 01:32:37,282
Maybe!

771
01:32:38,682 --> 01:32:42,038
But today
the world is much better!

772
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:50,136
Do you hear me?
