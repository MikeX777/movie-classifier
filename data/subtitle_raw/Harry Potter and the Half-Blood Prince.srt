...this very minute, perhaps...

...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle's walls.

344
00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:49,648
But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.

345
00:31:52,701 --> 00:31:54,817
Just something to think about.

00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,660

-I had a free period this morning, professor.
-So I noticed.

00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,155
I would think you would want to
fill it with Potions.

355

Or is it no longer your ambition
to become An Auror?

356
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,454
It was, but I was told I had to
get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.

357
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,454
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

358
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:51,217
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly
happy to accept N.E.W.T. students...

359

my book yet, and nor has Ron.

374
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:40,100
now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.

375
00:33:40,271 --> 00:33:44,230
Any ideas what these might be?

376
00:33:45,735 --> 00:33:48,317
-Yes, Miss...?
-Granger, sir.

377
00:33:51,575 --> 00:33:56,035
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

378
00:33:56,204 --> 00:33:58,911
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

379
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:04,205
It's terribly tricky to make.

380
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,416
And this is Amortentia...

381
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,002
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

382
00:34:09,927 --> 00:34:13,761
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

383
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:17,048
For example, I smell...

384
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:21,849
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

385
00:34:22,023 --> 00:34:25,356
...spearmint toothpaste.

386
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:30,236
SLUGHORN: Now, amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

387
00:34:30,407 --> 00:34:35,401
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

388
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:42,246
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

389
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,587
Sir? You haven't told us
what’s in that one.

What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...

392
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:01,015
...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

393
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:03,680
But it is more commonly referred to as--

394
00:35:03,858 --> 00:35:09,148
-Liquid Luck.
-Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid Luck.

395
00:35:09,656 --> 00:35:12,648
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

So this is what I offer each of you today.

399
00:35:27,842 --> 00:35:32,677
One tiny vial of Liquid Luck to the student
who, in the hour that remains...

400
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:37,432
...manages to brew an acceptable
Draught of Living Death...

401
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,844

on page 10 of your books.

402

a student manage to brew A potion...

403
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:48,192
...of sufficient quality to claim this prize.

You crush it. Don't cut it.

408
00:36:34,244 --> 00:36:36,735
no. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's--

849
01:14:19,854 --> 01:14:23,346
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

-Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
-Dumbledore can make mistakes.

Yes, I did.

If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that’s news to the ministry...

870
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:11,800

Dumbledore wants it.

Purely for academic purposes,
you understand.

1186
01:47:07,779 --> 01:47:10,691
Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?

1187
01:47:10,865 --> 01:47:12,071
My thoughts exactly.

1188
01:47:12,242 --> 01:47:18,738
Always have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.

1189
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:23,993
Old Potions Master's habit, you know.

1190
01:47:24,672 --> 01:47:27,129
I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

1191
01:47:27,299 --> 01:47:30,962
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

1192
01:47:32,388 --> 01:47:33,969
Oh, dear.

1193
01:47:43,691 --> 01:47:46,899
-Would you Like me to say a few words?
-Yes.

1194
01:47:47,153 --> 01:47:48,689
He had a family, I trust?

1195
01:47:48,863 --> 01:47:50,353
Oh, yeah.

1196
01:47:55,704 --> 01:47:57,194

1198
01:48:03,754 --> 01:48:06,666
Farewell, Aragog...

...king of the arachnids.

1200
01:48:10,553 --> 01:48:13,135
Your body will decay...

1201
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:17,223
...but your spirit lingers on.

1202
01:48:17,935 --> 01:48:24,556
And your human friends find solace
in the loss they have sustained.

[SLUGHORN & HAGRID SINGING]

1204
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:43,368
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1205
01:48:43,545 --> 01:48:47,254
no bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

1206
01:48:47,424 --> 01:48:52,589
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1207
01:48:52,763 --> 01:48:57,928
One afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.

1208
01:48:58,102 --> 01:48:59,683
Poof.

1209
01:48:59,854 --> 01:49:03,062
-That's very odd, isn't it?
-It is, isn't it?

1210
01:49:03,233 --> 01:49:06,942
But that’s life, I suppose.

1211
01:49:07,112 --> 01:49:12,448
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

1212
01:49:12,617 --> 01:49:16,280
-Poof.
-Poof.

[HAGRID SNORING]

1214
01:49:30,845 --> 01:49:33,962
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1215
01:49:34,974 --> 01:49:39,263
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1216
01:49:40,188 --> 01:49:43,146
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

1217
01:49:43,942 --> 01:49:47,480
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1218
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:51,487
As I watched, it sank.

1219
01:49:52,993 --> 01:49:55,826
Just before it reached the bottom...

1220
01:49:55,996 --> 01:49:57,452
...it transformed...

1221
01:49:58,832 --> 01:50:00,663
...into a wee fish.

1222
01:50:02,336 --> 01:50:04,452
It was beautiful magic.

1223
01:50:05,464 --> 01:50:07,705
Wondrous to behold.

1224
01:50:10,344 --> 01:50:13,086
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1225
01:50:15,474 --> 01:50:16,509
Your mother.

1226
01:50:18,561 --> 01:50:21,052
The day I came downstairs...

1227
01:50:22,023 --> 01:50:24,309
...the day the bowl was empty...

1228
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:28,021
...was the day your mother....

01:50:32,033 --> 01:50:34,024
I know why you're here.

1230
01:50:37,039 --> 01:50:39,030
But I can't help you.

1231
01:50:40,834 --> 01:50:42,540
It would ruin me.

1232
01:50:46,257 --> 01:50:48,714
Do you know why I survived, professor?

1233
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:51,091
The night I got this?

1234
01:50:52,847 --> 01:50:54,462
Because of her.

1235
01:50:55,391 --> 01:50:57,177
Because she sacrificed herself.

1236
01:50:57,602 --> 01:50:59,968
Because she refused to step aside.

1237
01:51:00,146 --> 01:51:03,354
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

01:51:03,525 --> 01:51:07,234
-Don't say his name.
-I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

Otherwise, she died for nothing.

RIDDLE:
I was in the library the other night...

1254
01:52:47,675 --> 01:52:49,836
...in the Restricted Section...

1255
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:54,338
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1256
01:52:55,641 --> 01:52:58,383
It's called, as I understand it...

1257
01:52:59,687 --> 01:53:01,018
...a Horcrux.

1258
01:53:02,857 --> 01:53:05,599
-I beg your pardon?
-Horcrux.

1259
01:53:06,027 --> 01:53:08,689
I came across the term while reading...

1260
01:53:08,863 --> 01:53:11,855
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1261
01:53:12,033 --> 01:53:16,527
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom,
but this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed.

1262
01:53:16,705 --> 01:53:18,241
Which is...

1263
01:53:19,374 --> 01:53:21,205
...why I came to you.

1264
01:53:24,046 --> 01:53:29,666
A Horcrux is An object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1265
01:53:29,844 --> 01:53:32,460
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1266
01:53:35,057 --> 01:53:39,050
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1267
01:53:39,228 --> 01:53:42,846
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1268
01:53:43,024 --> 01:53:44,139
Protected?

1269
01:53:44,317 --> 01:53:47,525
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1270
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:51,401
In other words, you cannot die.

1271
01:53:58,582 --> 01:54:01,745
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1272
01:54:01,877 --> 01:54:04,664
SLUGHORN: I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

01:54:07,883 --> 01:54:09,214
Yes.

1275
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:14,675
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1276
01:54:15,558 --> 01:54:20,302
RIDDLE: Can you only split the soul once?
For instance, isn't seven...?

1277
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:21,970
Seven?

1278
01:54:22,732 --> 01:54:28,022
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1279
01:54:28,196 --> 01:54:31,939
To rip the soul into seven pieces....

1280
01:54:33,118 --> 01:54:36,155
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All Academic?

1281
01:54:40,918 --> 01:54:42,249
Of course, sir.

1282
01:54:45,214 --> 01:54:47,205
It'll be our little secret.

1283
01:54:56,017 --> 01:54:57,257
HARRY
Sir.

1284
01:55:12,659 --> 01:55:14,775
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1285
01:55:14,953 --> 01:55:17,615
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

1286
01:55:17,789 --> 01:55:20,906
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1287
01:55:21,084 --> 01:55:22,119
What are they exactly?

1288
01:55:22,294 --> 01:55:25,627
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1289
01:55:28,801 --> 01:55:30,507
A ring, for example.

1290
01:55:31,137 --> 01:55:32,627
Or a book.

1291
01:55:33,931 --> 01:55:36,297
-Tom Riddle's diary.
-It's a Horcrux, yes.

1292
01:55:36,809 --> 01:55:38,925
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1293
01:55:39,103 --> 01:55:41,389
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1294
01:55:41,564 --> 01:55:43,475
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1295
01:55:43,650 --> 01:55:48,644
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1296
01:55:48,822 --> 01:55:50,813
-The ring?
-Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1297
01:55:51,199 --> 01:55:55,943
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1298
01:55:56,121 --> 01:55:59,989
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux....

1299
01:56:00,167 --> 01:56:01,327
One destroys Voldemort.

1300
01:56:01,502 --> 01:56:04,414
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden Anywhere.

1301
01:56:04,588 --> 01:56:07,830
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1302
01:56:21,814 --> 01:56:23,679
...leaves traces.

1303
01:56:31,491 --> 01:56:33,573
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1304
01:56:33,743 --> 01:56:36,029
-When you leave the school?
-Yes.

1305
01:56:36,872 --> 01:56:39,955
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1306
01:56:40,125 --> 01:56:44,209
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1307
01:56:45,756 --> 01:56:50,420
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1308
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:56,676
SNAPE: Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1309
01:56:56,851 --> 01:56:59,467
...that you take too much for granted?

1310
01:56:59,645 --> 01:57:04,685
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this Anymore?

1311
01:57:04,859 --> 01:57:06,975
Whether it has or hasn’t is irrelevant.

1312
01:57:07,862 --> 01:57:13,653
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1313
01:57:32,054 --> 01:57:33,669
Oh, Harry.

1314
01:57:36,267 --> 01:57:38,599
You need a shave, my friend.

1315
01:57:41,397 --> 01:57:45,606
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1316
01:57:45,777 --> 01:57:49,736
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1317
01:57:51,283 --> 01:57:53,649
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1318
01:57:54,119 --> 01:57:55,609
I'm an old man.

1319
01:57:55,787 --> 01:57:57,448
You still look the same to me, sir.

1320
01:57:58,916 --> 01:58:01,908
Just Like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1321
01:58:02,086 --> 01:58:05,294
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1322
01:58:08,050 --> 01:58:12,544
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1323
01:58:12,722 --> 01:58:16,214
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1324
01:58:16,392 --> 01:58:18,223
But there is one condition?

1325
01:58:18,394 --> 01:58:21,602
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1326
01:58:22,482 --> 01:58:24,097
Yes, sir.

1327
01:58:24,275 --> 01:58:26,391
You do understand what I'm saying?

1328
01:58:26,986 --> 01:58:29,477
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1329
01:58:29,656 --> 01:58:31,988
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1330
01:58:32,159 --> 01:58:36,152
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1331
01:58:41,335 --> 01:58:42,916
Your word, Harry.

1332
01:58:44,546 --> 01:58:46,036
My word.

1333
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:48,501
Take my arm.

1334
01:58:49,927 --> 01:58:52,339
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1335
01:58:53,014 --> 01:58:56,472
Well, being me has its privileges.

This is the place.

01:59:46,152 --> 01:59:47,733
Oh, yes.

1338
01:59:48,655 --> 01:59:51,237
This place has known magic.

1339
01:59:59,249 --> 02:00:00,785
-Sir!
-In order to gain passage...

1340
02:00:00,959 --> 02:00:02,369
...payment must be made.

1341
02:00:02,544 --> 02:00:06,162
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1342
02:00:07,758 --> 02:00:09,589
-You should've let me, sir.
-No, Harry.

1343
02:00:10,052 --> 02:00:12,759
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1344
02:00:34,661 --> 02:00:39,280
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1345
02:00:39,458 --> 02:00:42,791
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1346
02:00:45,381 --> 02:00:46,791
Careful.

1347
02:01:10,323 --> 02:01:11,438
There it is.

1348
02:01:12,951 --> 02:01:15,658
The only question is,
how do we get there?

1349
02:01:37,852 --> 02:01:39,683
If you would, Harry.

1350
02:02:26,986 --> 02:02:29,398
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1351
02:02:30,031 --> 02:02:31,396
Oh, yes.

1352
02:02:42,503 --> 02:02:44,084
It has to be drunk.
