1
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:30,064
Get him! Get him!

2
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:32,900
Ready!

3
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:36,070
You're going down.
Set. Hike.

4
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:48,716
Damn.

5
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,718
Did that hurt?

6
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,688
Get up,
you ain't no carpet king,
you're a queen.

7
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,056
Get up!

8
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:58,292
Time-out.

9
00:00:58,426 --> 00:00:59,793
Get up, man.

10
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,230
I think his nose is broke.

11
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:05,499
You can get him for me.
Finish this thing off.

12
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,235
You gonna finish the game.

13
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:10,371
Next touchdown wins,
we got the ball,
so you man up.

14
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:11,772
I'm a little banged up here.

15
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,607
You know why you got
25 years?

16
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,276
Yeah, because I refused
to testify

17
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,111
against anybody
whose last name ended
in a vowel.

18
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:20,814
No, you got 25 years
because you're a quitter.

19
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,317
When things get tough,
you look for shortcuts.
You quit.

20
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:26,187
You quit on your family,
you quit on your friends,

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,755
you quit on God.

22
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:30,858
And that's because
you ain't got no heart.

23
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,460
Yeah, that's right,
I called you a quitter.

24
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,728
What you gonna do about it?

25
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:37,998
If that don't sit well
with you,
prove me wrong.

26
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:48,709
Barry Minkow,
for once in your life,
don't take a shortcut.

27
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:51,212
Take the pain and help
this team win.

28
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:57,518
Well, you know, I think
we're all born
with certain genes.

29
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,320
I think
Barry was missing one.

30
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,589
It's got to be something
deep-seated in Barry.

31
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,792
Barry did what he did.
I mean, nobody really
put him up to it.

32
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,760
Barry could convince
anybody of anything,

33
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,696
and he was very,
very good at it.

34
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,431
From the moment
he shook my hand...

35
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:11,932
He's a sociopath.

36
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,503
I thought this was
the entrepreneur of the year.

37
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,306
He was almost incapable
of not lying.

38
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,241
And, you know,
I give him credit for this

39
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,410
tremendous scam
that he pulled at that time.

40
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:23,744
He had so much charisma...

41
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,913
I've never seen anybody
like Barry.

42
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:29,116
...that you
believed everything.
Everything.

43
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,918
He could sell ice to Eskimos.

44
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,954
Barry reinvented himself.

45
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:38,091
You know, for a young guy,
it was pretty amazing
what he pulled off.

46
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:40,494
JERRI: He didn't want
his lights turned off.

47
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,031
He didn't want to be his dad.

48
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,401
Hey, pally boy.
BARRY: Hey, Pop.

49
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,072
How'd you do today?

50
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,942
Ah, not bad.

51
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:59,780
Outfitted the YMCA
down the street with
a half a dozen gym fans.

52
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,181
Half a dozen?

53
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,184
Good thing it gets hot
in the Valley, huh?

54
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,886
That's pretty good, right?

55
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,391
Let me give you
some advice, kiddo.

56
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:14,262
Never work for somebody else
if you can help it.

57
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:19,800
Now get in the house
and wash up.

58
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:27,641
Move.
Jeez.

59
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:29,310
Go away.

60
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,111
ROBERT: My commission check
is gonna be larger this week.

61
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:33,013
CAROL: Enough to pay
the gas bill?

62
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,382
(MUSIC PLAYING
OVER TELEVISION)

63
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:35,616
ROBERT: It'll be fine.

64
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,318
Mom said no MTV.

65
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,319
Ow!

66
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,220
Knock it off!
Shut up.

67
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,923
ROBERT: What are you
talking about?
I'm doing the best I can.

68
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,328
They do this every night.
When is this going to stop?

69
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:52,366
When someone in this family
figures outhow to earn
some real money.

70
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,034
FRANZESE: That was it.
He wanted to make money
and that was it.

71
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,536
MIKEY: He wanted millions.

72
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:56,604
FRANZESE:
That's what drove him.

73
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,105
JERRI: He wanted the girls.

74
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,308
FRANZESE: He wanted people
to love and adore him.

75
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:04,244
JERRI: And the girls
only wanted you
if you had a red Ferrari.

76
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:20,928
Hi, Mindy.

77
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,964
Hi...
Barry.

78
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,971
I'm telling you, man,
I'm making things change.

79
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,573
That so, big guy?

80
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,308
Yeah, that's so.
Check it out.

81
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,179
When'd that happen?

82
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,248
That's five days a week
for three months at the gym.

83
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:47,888
See, look, I might not have
Matt Maple's money.

84
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,357
I can't throw a football
like Bobby Biddelo.

85
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,925
No.
But I can look
like Lou Ferrigno.

86
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,494
I'm going after
the three Ps, Mikey.

87
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,262
What are the three Ps?

88
00:04:55,396 --> 00:05:00,968
Position plus possession
equals popularity.

89
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:03,837
I'm gonna build a new Barry.

90
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:07,575
Well, how's all this
supposed to happen?

91
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,310
I'm gonna start a business,
I'm gonna keep working out,

92
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:12,513
I'm gonna make a ton of money

93
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,182
and then I'm gonna have
everything that I want.

94
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:19,487
JERRI: He wanted to be a star.

95
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,490
MIKEY: It could have been
a fabulous story.

96
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,499
Barry! Get to it!

97
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:34,702
See, the way it goes
is you work off
your membership fee

98
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,605
by working off
your membership fee.

99
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,455
Hi, Mom.

100
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,590
Excuse me, could you just
hold on for one second.

101
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,325
I'll be right back with you.

102
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,728
Sweetheart, listen,
I heard on your last run

103
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,095
you brought the degreaser,
you brought the sanitizer,

104
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,397
but, Barry, you forgot the...

105
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:04,898
Scotchgard.
Scotchgard.

106
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,634
You can never,
never forget that.
I know.

107
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,570
Barry, we want to sell
Scotchgard.
Scotchgard. I know.

108
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,372
Listen, you gotta get
on this one,kiddo.
You're a terrific worker

109
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,174
but I don't want my boss
to think... Excuse me...

110
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,676
You don't want
your boss to think...

111
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,010
I just don't want
my boss to think

112
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,378
that you're just here
because of me.

113
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:19,947
That would be terrible.
That would be nepotism.

114
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,348
I'm a good worker.
Just...

115
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,451
Yeah, go back and work.
Go, go, go.

116
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,018
Sorry.

117
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,689
Hello?

118
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,564
Whoa.

119
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:37,998
That guy juices.

120
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,401
What, you mean steroids?

121
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:44,538
No, like, I think
he drinks a lot of V8.

122
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,373
Yeah, I mean steroids.

123
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,277
Awesome.

124
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,820
Hey, how do you get so big?

125
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,555
How do you think?

126
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,125
Is there...

127
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,596
Is there any way
I could buy some
'roids off of you?

128
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,998
How you gonna pay, kid?

129
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,267
I got a part-time job
cleaning carpets.
I can pay.

130
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:19,573
I'll tell you what.
I'll swap you.

131
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:23,611
A carpet cleaning
for some 'roids.

132
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,413
Deal.

133
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,516
We're done, kid.

134
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,689
Nice job, kid.

135
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,258
Definitely worth
some of these.

136
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,832
Thanks.

137
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,366
Hey, um...

138
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,268
Hey, what is all this stuff?

139
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,037
Just call it my inventory.

140
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,773
Ah. Gotcha.

141
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:58,746
Yeah, as soon as I figure out
how to get my own
steam cleaner,

142
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,247
I'm gonna go
into business for myself.

143
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,983
How much do
one of them things cost?

144
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,652
Like a thousand bucks.

145
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,219
Tell you what.

146
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:17,230
A thousand cash for equipment.
Six bills for capital.

147
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,269
Now you're in business, kid.

148
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,506
Um...

149
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,779
Oh, you'll pay me back.

150
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,514
Interest only. $200 a week.

151
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,250
What are you,
some kind of loan shark?

152
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:40,020
I'm a businessman, kid.

153
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,689
You want in?

154
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,993
Yeah. Yeah, I want in.

155
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,262
* It's another great day

156
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:52,499
* It's another great day

157
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:55,168
* It's another fine moment

158
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,239
* And it keeps getting better

159
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,876
* Yeah, I'm making it happen

160
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:08,248
* This is where it all begins

161
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,352
* In my perfect world

162
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,488
* Perfect world

163
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,226
* I can't wait to wake up

164
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,731
* I can't wait to wake up

165
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:27,467
* And do it again

166
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,872
* This is where it all begins

167
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,443
* In my perfect world

168
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,847
* Perfect world

169
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:44,017
* Perfect world

170
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,218
* I can't wait to... *

171
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,054
Yes, hello, there.

172
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:51,692
I just had my carpets cleaned
by this company
called ZZZZ Best.

173
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:55,528
It's owned
by this wonderful kid
who is only 16.

174
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:57,665
You should do a story
on him.

175
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:02,369
All I see on the news
are stories about kids
on drugs and in gangs.

176
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:06,173
This young man
is a role model.

177
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,075
What's that?

178
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,010
All right.

179
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,312
Yes, ZZZZ Best.

180
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,547
Four Zs.
With four Zs.

181
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:18,786
Okay. Thank you. Goodbye.

182
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,222
Thank you, Grandma.
You're the best.

183
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,324
What, you can't stay
and visit?

184
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,492
I wish I could.
I've got so much to do.

185
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,327
But I'll come by later.

186
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,462
Can you make me
some of that spaghetti
that you make so good?

187
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,298
With the meatballs, too.

188
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:35,268
I'm just so proud of my son.
He did this all himself.

189
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,370
Can you make sure
the sign is in the shot?

190
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:38,906
So, what's Barry's secret?

191
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,308
Well, he's always been
highly motivated.

192
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,311
Dad, stop.
No false modesty, son.

193
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,815
I'd like to take
this opportunity and offer
anyone who's watching

194
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:50,350
a 50% discount
if they come down,
right now.

195
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,385
I will clean
your carpets personally.

196
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,754
Dad will even help too!
Do you see
what I'm talking about?

197
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,523
I mean, he's brilliant!
Barry Minkow.

198
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,761
Hey, Barry.

199
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,864
Yo, Barr!

200
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,700
Barry, my man!

201
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,601
Hey, carpet dude!

202
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:15,909
Hi.
Hey.

203
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,250
Well, do you like
your meal?

204
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,118
It was really good.

205
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,586
Are you ready to go?
Yeah.

206
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,588
I don't really like
horror movies
that much,

207
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:32,125
but do you wanna see
Blade Runner
with me this weekend?

208
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,394
Yeah? Awesome.

209
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,698
Two hundred and forty bucks!

210
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:41,468
Don't sweat it, man.
Business is good!

211
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,036
But you're doing this
every weekend.

212
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,206
Okay, will you look around you
for a second?

213
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,108
Dude,

214
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:53,680
I'm finally in.
We are finally in.
It's totally worth it.

215
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:03,423
You can't do this to me.
I haven't done anything wrong.

216
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,426
Barry. Sit down.

217
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:16,269
We didn't realize
that you were underage.

218
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,771
In the state of California,

219
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,639
the signature card
that opens a checking account,

220
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,042
it's a legally
binding document.

221
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,376
It's a contract.

222
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,412
And you cannot sign
a legally binding

223
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,414
business check
if you're only 16.

224
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:31,251
Now, like I said, if you want
to get your father
in here to co-sign...

225
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,820
My father?

226
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,689
It's my company, okay?

227
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:38,558
I started this thing,
not my dad.

228
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,527
You know this!
Barry, listen.

229
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,797
I'm not one
to stifle entrepreneurship.

230
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:47,634
I'm impressed with what
you've accomplished,
believe me.

231
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,103
But this is the way
the system works.

232
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,472
Now, I have no choice
but to close
your account immediately

233
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,842
and return
all outstanding checks.

234
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,378
You said you were
impressed by me. Right?

235
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,952
Then why can't you make
an exception for me?

236
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,019
I'm sorry, kid.

237
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,720
You've seen what I've done.

238
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:11,224
I really am.
I wish it didn't have
to be this way.

239
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,626
But the rules are the rules.

240
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,795
You can't break the rules.

241
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,066
Look at me, kid.

242
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,102
I can't let you
bounce checks on me.

243
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,904
I know.

244
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,939
And I've been
lettin' you skate.

245
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:33,146
You owe me 800 bucks.

246
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,147
I know.

247
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,782
I know. Look, Victor, man,

248
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,750
you know I'm in trouble
with these checking accounts.

249
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:41,821
Okay? I would have to be crazy
to try to screw you.

250
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:45,358
I wouldn't even be in business
if it wasn't for you, man.

251
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,127
I owe you big.

252
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:53,233
All I got to my name
is 20 bucks.
Just take it.

253
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,601
Okay, enough.

254
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,972
Okay, look.

255
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,508
You pay me $500 cash
by Friday,

256
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:05,045
I let the other $300 slide
for one more week.

257
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,446
You got it?

258
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,847
Thank you.

259
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,417
Thank you, man.
I won't let you down.

260
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,885
I promise.

261
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,754
You better not.

262
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,472
Mr. Barry.

263
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,441
Ron, I need a money order

264
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,177
for Sparkle Janitorial Supply
for 500 bucks.

265
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,645
Coming right up.

266
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,389
MAN: Hey, Ron,
you got a delivery!

267
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,258
Hey, Barry, give me one sec.
I'll be right back.

268
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,825
Yeah, yeah.

269
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,293
Oh, God!

270
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:37,971
MAN: Barry,
you feeling all right?

271
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:40,974
Yeah... No, no,
I'm good, I'm good.

272
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,417
I saw you on the news.
You're an impressive
young man, Barry.

273
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,019
How can I help you?

274
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:29,156
Mr. Fitzgerald,
I've been to every bank
n the area

275
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,591
and no one will open
a business
checking account for me

276
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,992
because they say
I'm too young.

277
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,961
Funny thing is,
I already had one open

278
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,730
for over half a year
before anyone ever
found out my age.

279
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:41,668
I would have thought
that I had proven my ability
to be responsible.

280
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:46,206
You don't impress me
as being too young.
You seem pretty mature.

281
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,341
I get that all the time.

282
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,143
Look, Mr. Fitzgerald,

283
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,012
I've started a good business.

284
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,547
And I know
what I'm capable of.

285
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,982
I mean, I already have
seven employees,

286
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,585
all of whom are paying taxes
on their wages.

287
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,353
I'm simply a victim of my age.

288
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:01,721
Well put.

289
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,626
I just need someone
to take a small risk

290
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,261
and put a little trust in me.

291
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,402
Fine. I'll take the chance.

292
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:19,906
But you'll need to keep me
updated twice a week
on ZZZZ Best's status.

293
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,710
Even though every newspaper
and TV show
is keeping me posted.

294
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,645
Here, I want you
to sign the bottom here.

295
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,081
Of course.
I'll fill in the rest, okay?

296
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:33,853
Thank you.
Congratulations.

297
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,555
I won't let you down.

298
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,258
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING
ON CAR STEREO)

299
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,931
What is this?

300
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,066
What do you think, huh?
What is this?

301
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,201
What?

302
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,070
Dude!

303
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:53,072
What is this?
Come on, baby.

304
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,441
Jump in,
let's go for a spin.
What?

305
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,443
How...

306
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,946
How did you afford this, man?
We're not making any profits.

307
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,748
Don't have to afford it.

308
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,983
Just gotta cover
the monthly payments.

309
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,687
Look, it's all
about appearances,
my man.

310
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:13,160
The way you look
is the way
the world thinks you are.

311
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,027
Speaking of appearances,

312
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:17,364
there's a misprint
in the Yellow Pages ad.

313
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:20,867
It says, "Serving the area
for over 10 years."

314
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,602
That's not a misprint.

315
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,771
It's a business tactic.

316
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,774
Everybody does it.
Nobody is going to check.

317
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,242
What do they have to check?

318
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:30,877
What, you think
anyone is gonna believe

319
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,414
you started the business
when you were six years old?

320
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,349
That's ambitious, man.

321
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:39,852
Must have been tough
balancing nap time
and making payroll.

322
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:42,622
You wanna think?
Or you wanna drive?

323
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,056
Let's drive, man.

324
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,662
Fastest car on the market.

325
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,065
Hold on.

326
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,045
I can't stay ahead of expenses
no matter how much
business I bring in.

327
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,747
Victor's payments
are killing me.

328
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,759
Mikey...

329
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,462
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.
Check this out.

330
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,731
Yeah. What?

331
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,866
Look at this.
Look, the checks...

332
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:32,339
The checks from
the NorthRidge account
haven't cleared yet.

333
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,040
All right?

334
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,710
So if I write a check
from that account
into the second account,

335
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,179
I can cover my shortage
until I can deposit
more customer checks.

336
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,714
And then I just run it
the other way

337
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,082
when the NorthRidge account
is short.

338
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:44,817
Then I never have to
keep the full amount

339
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,719
as long as I deposit
the new money in time.

340
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,755
Yeah. That's called
check kiting.

341
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,189
Really?

342
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,259
I thought I made that up.

343
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,626
No, you did not.

344
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,861
Anyways, anyways,
it doesn't matter.

345
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,296
Yeah, it does, it's illegal.

346
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,196
It doesn't matter.

347
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,598
It's only temporary.

348
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,433
It's only until I can
square things up.

349
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,034
'Cause kids,
during the summertime,
are gonna work cheap.

350
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,336
I can go after
more customers,

351
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,904
I can do
more advertising and then...

352
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,038
And then I can
pay it all off...

353
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,307
It's gonna cost you
more money.

354
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,941
I can pay it all off!

355
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,982
Everything's gonna be fine.

356
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:37,870
Mikey!

357
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,207
You're late.

358
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,211
I know. I know.
I was at Victor's. Sorry.

359
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,246
I had to pick up
some company letterhead.

360
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,981
Letterhead?
Yeah, yeah.

361
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,484
You know,
for corporate documents,
that kind of thing.

362
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,886
Did you get another loan?

363
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,122
What do you mean,
did I get another loan?

364
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,824
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

365
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,059
You got another loan?
How much was it?
Yes. Yes.

366
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,496
Four grand. But it's not
a big deal.
Interest is like $500 a week.

367
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,131
$500 a week! Barry...
Okay, hear me out.
Hear me out.

368
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,766
No, no, no.
Give me your hand.

369
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:10,136
What?
Half the reason
I got the loan

370
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,573
is because I think that you

371
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,777
deserve a bonus.

372
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,412
Really?
Yeah, really.

373
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:21,814
Come on, man.
You work your butt off.

374
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,451
I just want you to know
I appreciate you.

375
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:28,655
Go take out that
cute little girl
I saw you with last week.

376
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,089
I...

377
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:33,826
I think you're gonna
like this place.

378
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,161
All right.

379
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:01,921
Beats the garage, huh?

380
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,024
It's awesome, man.

381
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,693
ROBERT: Hey, Barry.

382
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,127
I'm up here, Pop.

383
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,268
Well...

384
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:19,205
Very nice.

385
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,342
Impressive.

386
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:25,612
Son...

387
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,581
You know
I am so proud of you.

388
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:33,019
But I don't want you
to get in any trouble.

389
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,121
And I just feel like...

390
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:37,457
You're in over your head.

391
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,527
Dad, don't tell me
how to run my business.

392
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,795
No, no, no. Your whole life
you've played it safe, okay?

393
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:44,363
I'm taking my shot here.

394
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,970
Hey...

395
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:54,507
Why don't you come
work for ZZZZ Best?

396
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:57,644
You can build up
my commercial accounts.

397
00:22:57,777 --> 00:23:00,346
I'll match your salary
at Windy City
with a better commission.

398
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,881
I don't think
that's the best idea.

399
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:03,349
Come on, Dad.
You've always been at jobs

400
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,184
that didn't require
any talent.

401
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:10,222
Come work for me.
Show me what you can do.

402
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,502
Come here.

403
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,304
Son...

404
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,413
Hey, Dad?

405
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:37,316
You start work Monday.

406
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:41,754
See you later, Mr. Minkow.

407
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,723
Yeah, see you, boys.

408
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,928
That's our new
commercial manager.

409
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:50,229
You have a sec?
Yeah.

410
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,402
Look at that.

411
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:58,505
So...

412
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:01,741
I might not be smart enough
to get it,

413
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:06,513
but Victor doesn't sell
cleaning equipment, right?

414
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,981
No, but the banks
and insurance companies

415
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,282
don't need to know that.

416
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,752
Right, so...

417
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:17,890
We purchased
10 Crowell Triple-Vac
Dual Pump...

418
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:20,226
Water-heated steam cleaners.

419
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,064
I don't know that brand.

420
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:28,134
That's 'cause
they don't exist.

421
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:31,270
Sounds good though, right?

422
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:35,307
Yeah.

423
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:38,110
Sounds good.

424
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,613
Hey, Mike.

425
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:42,114
From now on...

426
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:44,416
"Mr. Minkow."

427
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,121
Hey! If that isn't
the little...

428
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:52,024
Look at you!
Not so little anymore.
What happened to you?

429
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,026
Hey, Uncle Joe.

430
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,362
Look at you.
Trying to look like you.

431
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,598
I should be so lucky.

432
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:03,002
Damn! Come here, I want to
show you something.
Watch your step.

433
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,137
What... What happened
to this place?

434
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:06,873
Well, this one
was a flood.

435
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,108
Hard to imagine
you could do anything
with this, huh?

436
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,678
It smells like
the inside of
a Halloween costume.

437
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:15,948
This is called
restoration work.

438
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:17,316
Fires, floods...

439
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,218
The insurance companies
contract it out

440
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,955
to restore it
and make it new again.

441
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:26,225
Big money. Big money.

442
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,595
This could be your future.

443
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:30,697
Come on. I want to
show you something.

444
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,407
Wow. This is amazing.
Mmm-hmm.

445
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,579
Before and after.
Not bad for
three weeks' work, huh?

446
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:50,249
Look. Uncle Joe,
I appreciate you
bringing me out here,

447
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,720
but I'm just
a carpet cleaner.

448
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:58,424
Yeah. So was I
when I started 35 years ago.

449
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:03,095
You know,
all the carpet companies
out there...

450
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,064
All your competitors,
they all advertise

451
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,266
for one big thing
that you don't.

452
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,869
Emergency water damage
restoration.

453
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,373
Water heater
busts in the house,

454
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,408
water floods
the carpets everywhere.

455
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,077
The first people called
are the carpet cleaners

456
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,979
who come in
and extract the water.

457
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:23,482
Bingo! And you make millions.

458
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:30,189
If you're ever interested
in that kinda thing,
just let me know.

459
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,258
I'll help you
find some work.

460
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:51,778
Are you insane?

461
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:54,681
You can't open
another office.

462
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:56,649
Barry, you think that
I don't know that you're
kiting checks again?

463
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,951
This company is hanging on
by a thread.

464
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:00,687
Relax.
And we both know...

465
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,690
Relax! Okay?
Everybody cheats a little bit.
It's not a big deal.

466
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,057
It's a big deal.
It is a big deal.

467
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:06,959
It's not.
It's not a big deal!

468
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:10,396
Okay? I had to expand
to generate more cash
to catch up on my...

469
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:13,199
Barry, you can't run
one office on...
Do not...

470
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:17,036
Do not raise your...
Barry!

471
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,872
Do not raise
your voice at me.

472
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:27,814
It's settled. All right?

473
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:32,819
I already got the location
picked out.

474
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,993
Look, everybody thinks
I'm some kind of
hotshot now, man.

475
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,932
Barry Minkow,
the young entrepreneur.

476
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:49,936
I gotta keep that going.

477
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:52,671
Mike, it's who I am now.

478
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:20,166
With the debts
and the divorce, I really need
the extra income.

479
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,001
Great. Happy to help.

480
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:25,471
Now, I need you to
mock up a few documents

481
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:28,941
for a bloated
insurance company.
So, don't feel bad.

482
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:31,577
Feeling bad was
not something
I was factoring in.

483
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,815
You do have the cash, right?

484
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,295
You're sure this was
one of your competitors?

485
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,496
Yeah.

486
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,731
What did they steal?

487
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:28,500
Four Crowell Triple Vac
steam cleaners.

488
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:30,669
Yeah, but Barry,
even at 1,500 a piece,

489
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:32,038
that doesn't equal $12,000.

490
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:33,139
Water damage.

491
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:35,207
"Water damage"?

492
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:36,775
Yeah.

493
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:39,511
See, when they broke in,
they set off the sprinklers,

494
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:40,880
which caused water damage.

495
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:43,382
These guys are trying to
put me out of business!

496
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,384
But we fixed it.

497
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,453
Because that's what we do.

498
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:50,722
It's expensive.
Really?

499
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:53,092
Yeah, it's called
"restoration work."

500
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,827
In fact, ZZZZ Best is going to

501
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,162
be awarded out
more restoration jobs

502
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,429
from other big companies

503
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:59,866
as early as next week
and that...

504
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:01,968
That's where the real
growth opportunities are

505
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,769
in the carpet-cleaning
industry.

506
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:19,251
I think a little toast
is in order for the man
of the hour.

507
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:22,021
Dad, come on.
No, no, no.

508
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,524
Here's to Barry
on your 18th birthday.

509
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:30,496
You're an adult,
well, legally anyway.

510
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:33,765
Now, you can get married,
even join the army

511
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,135
with or without
our permission.
To my son, Barry...

512
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:37,904
I am sorry to interrupt,

513
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:41,073
but you know how it is
when your father tries
to be funny.

514
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:43,042
Right...

515
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:47,146
But I would like to
say something.
I'd like to toast you, Barry.

516
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:55,054
I am so proud
of your success.

517
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:58,824
Thank you, Mom.

518
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:04,130
Cheers.
To ZZZZ Best, son.

519
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:05,932
Cheers, guys.
Mazel tov.

520
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,507
WOMAN: And so,
as we look forward

521
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,543
to the excitement
of new lives,

522
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:19,211
we, the fresh-faced class...

523
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:21,613
MIKEY: Man, I feel like
I don't even know you anymore.

524
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,517
Come on.
Yeah you do, Mikey.

525
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:30,122
Same old Barry. I'm just
a regular business now,
that's all.

526
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:33,525
But like Icarus,
who flew too high to the sun,

527
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,527
we need to keep watch,

528
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:38,564
to keep level and not
let the temptations
of our new freedom

529
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,432
be the end of us.

530
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,701
Come on.

531
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:43,970
Who doesn't cheat
on their taxes

532
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,437
or inflate
an insurance claim?

533
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,974
Can we just enjoy graduation?

534
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:51,443
I applaud you fellow students
on this day of rebirth...

535
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,479
The answer is, everyone.

536
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,081
And nobody gets hurt,
all right?

537
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:58,050
So, don't come at me
with that
self-righteous attitude.

538
00:31:58,184 --> 00:32:02,288
In fact, I think I deserve
a little thanks.

539
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,458
Really. You're running
flush now because of me.

540
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:09,561
Congratulations to
the class of 1984!

541
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:36,788
Damn it.

542
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:27,906
JOE: Hey,
it's your favorite uncle.

543
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,241
BARRY: Hey, Uncle Joe.
How are you?

544
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,277
JOE: I'm good, kid. Listen.

545
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,046
I'm out there
in the business community
and I'm hearing things.

546
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,183
Like you're expanding too fast
and you can't possibly
be profitable.

547
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:39,551
BARRY: Uncle Joe,
that's just jealous people

548
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,054
using their stories
as an excuse
for their mediocrity.

549
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:44,823
Yeah, yeah.
I'm hearing that, too.
See?

550
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,925
JOE: Okay. All right.
But be careful.

551
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:50,162
You have to be a little bit
of a thief in business,
I know that.

552
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:52,631
But you don't want
to become a thief.

553
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,901
Then you're not
in business anymore,
you're just a crook.

554
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,007
There's a project
over in Tarzana

555
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:04,076
and I have
an interested buyer.

556
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,345
He won't close on the sale
until I fix a rip
in the carpet.

557
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:07,646
BARRY: I'll get someone
right on it.

558
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,315
JOE: No, no. He wants you.

559
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:12,151
He wants to meet
the millionaire kid
success story.

560
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:15,754
Just be careful. I hear
this guy's connected.
A real Mafioso.

561
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,123
I mean it.

562
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:22,861
I read about you
in the Examiner,
didn't I?

563
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:25,931
Yeah, yeah.

564
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,334
Joe says you're a pro.

565
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:29,835
That's my Uncle Joe.

566
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:35,006
How do you do that, Barry?

567
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:39,077
Pull down a profit like that?

568
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:40,779
Cleaning carpet?

569
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:43,749
I never heard of that.

570
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:49,855
Well, Jack, the real money,
it's not
in the carpet cleaning.

571
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:52,090
It's in these things
called restoration jobs.

572
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:53,392
Oh, yeah?

573
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,428
Like cleaning up
after an old fire?

574
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:58,063
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

575
00:34:58,197 --> 00:35:01,300
Um, the jobs,
they come in through...

576
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,001
Through these
insurance adjusters.

577
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:05,171
My company, ZZZZ Best,
we got, like...

578
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,406
We got three of these jobs
lined up right now.

579
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,940
But I plan on expanding,

580
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:13,579
because each job contract
is worth about 25 grand.

581
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,381
That must be nice.

582
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:17,783
BARRY: Yeah, yeah.
It's really nice.

583
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,117
You know, you have
these huge buildings

584
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,753
with these complex
sprinkler systems

585
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:25,023
and they go off inadvertently,
causing floods.

586
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:27,393
You know,
and it's expensive to fix.

587
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:32,631
If I had the money,
there's no limit
to what I could do.

588
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:35,100
How much?
A hundred grand.

589
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:40,005
A hundred grand?
Just for clean

590
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,907
No, no.
It's much more than that.

591
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,377
It's extracting the water,
dehumidifying the area,

592
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:47,313
you know,
padding and tack strips,
mold treatment.

593
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:49,881
You see,
all this requires money,
lots of money,

594
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:51,917
and these worthless
insurance companies,

595
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,486
they're notoriously slow
for these large payouts.

596
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:58,023
And see, that's what
sets me apart
from my competition.

597
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,492
Look, Jack,
how many carpet cleaners

598
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:03,061
do you know in this business
that are well

599
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:06,632
How much are you
gonna pull down right now?

600
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,767
With these restorations?

601
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,204
These three?
Eighty grand. Profit.

602
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:17,309
It's good. So give me proof.

603
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:18,410
Proof?

604
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:19,545
Yeah, proof of
the jobs, huh?

605
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,079
A little accountability.
You know?

606
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:23,615
I mean,
I'll come in right now.
Fifty grand cash.

607
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:25,951
You need money,
I'll raise money, you know.

608
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:29,755
I'll talk to friends.
It's all numbers, Barry.

609
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:31,156
"Numbers"?
It's just numbers.

610
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,660
Yeah, yeah, numbers.
It's all numbers.

611
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:37,296
We come in,

612
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:40,732
we come in for a lot more
than a hundred, you know.

613
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,133
A lot more.

614
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:47,205
We split profit,
you know? 50/50.

615
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,008
"50/50"?

616
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:55,213
All the jobs.
If you're interested.

617
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:02,521
Yeah. Yeah! Yeah, of course,
I'm interested.

618
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,998
The proof, the documents,
I can bring those by tomorrow.

619
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:16,435
You want a drink?

620
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,971
Nah, I don't drink.

621
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:24,410
Good for you.
You're a smart kid.

622
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:33,084
This is unacceptable.

623
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:34,920
You don't understand.
No, no, you don't understand.

624
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:38,357
You got those
credit card accounts
because I vouched for you!

625
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,726
Twenty-five thousand
in fraudulent accounts!

626
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,528
Look it wasn't me! I swear!

627
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:43,729
Barry.

628
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:45,597
It was crooked
carpet cleaners! Look...

629
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:48,367
They want me
out of business...
Keep it down.

630
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,201
Look, they faked
the credit card slips

631
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:52,638
so they could double-bill
the customers
and make more money.

632
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,272
What do you want me to do?

633
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:56,107
I just found out
about this last night.
I already fired them.

634
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:57,743
Were you planning
on telling me?

635
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:59,911
Yes... I guess...
You guess?

636
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:03,482
Yes, yes, yes.
Of course I was planning on...

637
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:07,152
Look, I'm a little
over my head here, Bill.

638
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:11,423
Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

639
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:15,894
All right.

640
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:21,967
I can keep your accounts open
for five business days.

641
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,069
You deposit $10,000
at that time

642
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:26,071
and the rest five days
after that...

643
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:27,305
I won't let you down.

644
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:28,974
You better meet
these deadlines, Barry.

645
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,476
Otherwise, I will
shut you down

646
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:32,444
and I will bounce
all your checks.

647
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:37,383
This is a joke to you, huh?

648
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:42,421
That would put me
out of business.

649
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,590
I know.
So it should motivate you.

650
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:46,191
Now, get the hell out of here.

651
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,536
Hey, I need your help.

652
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:02,874
Look, we need to find
a way to fake some
nonexistent restoration jobs.

653
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:06,945
All right? I'm not
talking about staging
a phony break-in.

654
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:12,718
I'm talking about hundreds
of thousands of dollars
in jobs that don't exist.

655
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,252
Got any ideas?

656
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:17,022
I can incorporate
a phony adjusting firm.

657
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,126
A phony adjusting firm.

658
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:26,932
So, what, it would fake
the jobs
on the firm's letterhead?

659
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,333
Yeah.

660
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:33,138
That's great.
That's great! Okay.

661
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:35,073
And in the meantime,
I'll work hard

662
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,610
trying to get ZZZZ Best
some legitimate claims
to cover your back.

663
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:41,046
I'll catch you
in your office later.

664
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,982
Okay, okay. Thank you.

665
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:47,085
I really appreciate this.
I wouldn't ask you if
it wasn't life or death.

666
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,655
I got 100 employees
depending on me.

667
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,056
Well, they're your problem.

668
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:53,158
I'm just doing this
for money, is all.

669
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,560
As long as you do it.

670
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:07,539
So, he's still standing there,

671
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:09,675
in his underwear,
holding an identical
toothbrush.

672
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:12,644
So, I tell the guy,
as we always say at ZZZZ Best,

673
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:15,481
"We don't just cut corners,
we clean them."

674
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:22,353
Can I trust him?
Absolutely.

675
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:25,256
So, let me explain to you
how a restoration job works.

676
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,825
All right, gorgeous woman.

677
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,059
Come here.
You be the building.

678
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:29,394
Stand here
next to me. All right?

679
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:31,096
Come here! Come on. I'm...

680
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:47,679
What about the Feds?

681
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,248
Huh?

682
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,584
Did they come see you yet?

683
00:40:52,718 --> 00:40:54,419
Who?
The FBI.

684
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:58,590
The FBI... No.
No?

685
00:40:58,724 --> 00:41:00,291
No.

686
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:06,164
Well... They might,
you know.

687
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,166
They'll probably pay you
a visit.

688
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:11,537
Ask questions about me.

689
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:15,306
Well, if they do,
just say nothing more

690
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,776
than our arrangement,
you know?

691
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:20,311
"Our arrangement"?

692
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,313
Yeah, it's legitimate.

693
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:26,151
You could prove that.

694
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,155
Can't you?
Yeah, yeah.

695
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:32,758
Of course.
Of course I can prove it.

696
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:16,301
Hey, how you doing?

697
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:19,404
How are you?
Hi.

698
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:23,575
Hi. Hey, baby.
I got a present
for you inside. Okay?

699
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:25,911
Okay.
I'll be in in a second.

700
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,617
Can I help you?

701
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,952
Yeah, you can.
I'll introduce myself
to you first.

702
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:36,454
I'm Special Agent Gamble. FBI.

703
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:40,759
That's your girlfriend?

704
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,664
Yeah.
Very nice. Good luck.

705
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:47,265
Thank you.

706
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:52,804
Anyway, I'm here,
I'm investigating a Jack...

707
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:53,905
Saxon.

708
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:56,574
Yes. Jack Saxon.

709
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:58,343
I understand he's been
shaking you down

710
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:00,111
on some loan
that he made you...

711
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:02,047
He hasn't given me a loan,
he's a business consultant.

712
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,715
"Business consultant"?

713
00:43:07,352 --> 00:43:10,856
New house, huh?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

714
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:14,893
Look, we'd like you
to testify in a grand jury

715
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:17,629
about your business deals
with this Saxon.

716
00:43:19,665 --> 00:43:21,767
With all due respect,
why would I testify
against him?

717
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,501
He's been nothing
but a help to my company.

718
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:25,070
I understand.
It's not...

719
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:26,938
Barry? Come on inside.

720
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,375
Come on.

721
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:33,779
Sorry. Duty calls. It was
nice to meet you,
Mr. Special Agent...

722
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:35,380
Gamble.
Gamble.

723
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:38,216
Thank you, Mr. Mincow.

724
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,218
It's Minkow.

725
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,088
HALL: There was a cockiness,
I was cocky. Barry was cocky.

726
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:46,324
Everything we did
just seemed to fall
nto place.

727
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:50,561
It was almost like we were
beinglooked over by some
guardian angel.

728
00:43:50,696 --> 00:43:53,264
JERRI: In fact, there were
more people
that didn't believe Barry

729
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:55,233
than the ones that did.

730
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:56,968
But he only needed a couple.

731
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:59,270
HALL: Altogether,
I think the FBI said

732
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:02,674
I created about 23,000
false documents

733
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:05,744
to convince Wall Street,
NASDAQ and the SEC

734
00:44:05,877 --> 00:44:09,580
that we were doing about
$400 million
worth of restoration work

735
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:12,150
when in reality,
we were doing none.

736
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:13,584
JERRI: Barry was working with

737
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:15,486
the investment banking firm
of Payne Cameron

738
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,422
to take ZZZZ Best public.

739
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:22,560
However, Barry and Jack Saxon
had a side scheme
to pump and dump,

740
00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:24,996
acquiring ZZZZ Best stock
at five cents apiece,

741
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:29,367
selling at the market price
and violating securities laws.

742
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,738
HALL: The biggest scam
we pulled off
was the Sacramento job.

743
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:36,207
Barry staged a walkthrough
of a newly-restored
office building

744
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:37,976
to fool
the Wall Street auditors

745
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:39,544
into believing that ZZZZ Best

746
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,546
had done
all of the restoration work.

747
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,115
We hadn't done
any of that work.

748
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:47,285
He even bribed the doorman
a hundred bucks
to make it look good.

749
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:49,888
Hey, Mr. Minkow!
Nice to see you again!

750
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,323
Bob, how are you?
How's the wife?
Still alive.

751
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:54,659
That's too bad.
Say hi to the kids for me.

752
00:44:54,793 --> 00:44:56,427
You got it!

753
00:44:56,561 --> 00:44:59,697
Just like family.
Everyone at ZZZZ Best
is like family.

754
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:03,101
JERRI: A con man
has a tremendous amount
of charisma.

755
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:04,803
Smell it and say
to the woman,

756
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:09,040
"Ma'am, that's not dog urine.
That's your three-year-old."

757
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:12,143
What's this ladder doing here?
Mike, please find out
who was here last.

758
00:45:12,277 --> 00:45:14,645
Doesn't even look like
there was
any water damage at all.

759
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,848
Well, that's the point.

760
00:45:16,982 --> 00:45:20,018
JERRI: See, he doesn't
take your money.
You give it to him.

761
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:23,254
Gentlemen, attached,
you will find
our project summary.

762
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:25,556
As you can see,
we went with
the cost-effective

763
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,258
nylon carpet to save time,

764
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:30,428
and, most importantly,
your money.

765
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:33,965
JERRI: It's theft
with a smile.

766
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:42,841
HALL: Once the Wall Street
auditors signed off
on our financials,

767
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:46,211
Payne Cameron
took ZZZZ Best public.

768
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:52,217
By the end of the day,
we had a market cap
of well over $300 million.

769
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:55,153
Truth be told,
we were worth almost nothing.

770
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:58,356
This is tremendous.
Where's Barry?
Dad.

771
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:59,991
Hey, Barry, we saw you
on Oprah.

772
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:01,993
Hey! I stole the show, right?
Listen, I want Carson.

773
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:04,796
I want to be on Johnny Carson!
What's this?

774
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:06,197
It's the Tribune! Read it!

775
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:08,867
"Happy Birthday, Barry Minkow.

776
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,603
"Your stock is worth
$100 million!

777
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:15,673
"You control a $300 million
public company"!

778
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,379
Hey, everybody!
Enough with this cheap stuff.

779
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,081
Hey, you, I don't even
know you.

780
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:25,183
Go buy me the most
expensive champagne
you can find.

781
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:26,351
Five hundred bottles.

782
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:28,253
Drinks on me, everybody!

783
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:38,864
So, you're
the birthday kid, huh?

784
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:40,398
Uh...

785
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:44,335
I'm not a kid.
All of these people here
work for me.

786
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:45,871
Well, I don't work for you.

787
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,407
Okay, who are you?

788
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,742
My name is Sam.

789
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:56,347
Sam, that's a guy's name.

790
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,016
You better be careful.

791
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:02,053
I might just decide
this party is a bore
and leave.

792
00:47:02,187 --> 00:47:03,654
Who invited you?

793
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:07,725
Happy birthday, Barry.
See you later.

794
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:11,429
Whoa. Babe.

795
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,431
Dude, stop. Stop.

796
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,033
Where's Mindy?

797
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:18,636
Okay. Have a good night,
buddy.

798
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:24,009
You've got all these
people fooled, don't ya?

799
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,913
If you've got a problem
with me,

800
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:30,148
you canalways stop
picking up your check.

801
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:36,021
You can't have me
fooled, Barry.
You can't have me fooled.

802
00:47:36,154 --> 00:47:40,658
You know what
the difference is
between you and me, Mike?

803
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:44,562
I lead. You follow.

804
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,197
You're embarrassing.

805
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:02,680
Baby.

806
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,615
Hey, birthday boy.
Close your eyes.

807
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:06,484
Why?
Close your eyes.

808
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,119
Okay.

809
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:11,289
What is this?

810
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:14,025
A little toy
for the love of my life.

811
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:15,493
What? No. Wait, Barry.

812
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,495
It's your birthday.
It's not my birthday.

813
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:18,997
Because I love you,
that's why.

814
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,131
What are you doing?

815
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:21,699
Listen... Listen to me. Now.

816
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,869
I want you to take
your new car,
grab a friend right now,

817
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:26,737
and I want you to go
for a little joyride,
all right?

818
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:29,274
And I don't want you come back
until this is on empty.

819
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:32,877
Right now?
Right now! Right now.
Go, go, go.

820
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:35,813
Thank you.
I love you.
You're welcome.

821
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:57,735
Hello there.

822
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:00,972
What took you so long?

823
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:08,179
It's my house,
you wait for me.

824
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:09,847
We'll see about that.

825
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:36,607
Ma! What are you doing here?

826
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:38,543
I'm sorry, I just wanted
to see you.

827
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:40,145
I wanted to congratulate you,

828
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:42,780
but you were surrounded by
so many presents and people,

829
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:45,250
I didn't get a chance...
I'm in the bathroom,
for God sakes.

830
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:50,721
But I wanted to
congratulate you on,
on the article.

831
00:49:50,855 --> 00:49:53,258
Dad give you that?
Yeah.

832
00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:55,693
You come over to tell me
you're proud of me?

833
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,264
It's very impressive.

834
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:04,869
"Impressive." I think
it's a bit more
than impressive...

835
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:08,106
Come on, you've been praying
for this your whole life,
haven't you?

836
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:15,413
Yeah, I was praying for this
but I was praying
to my vanity.

837
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:16,514
What's that supposed to mean?

838
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,316
Please listen. I wanted...

839
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,851
I wanted so much more
than what your father
could provide.

840
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:22,887
I didn't realize
what a good man he was.

841
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,990
"A good man." A good man
pays the water bill.

842
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:27,758
A good man keeps
the lights on in the house.

843
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:30,928
A good man will take care of
and provide for his family

844
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:34,165
no matter what the cost. I...
Mom... Mama... I'm a good man.

845
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:37,168
It's very hard to be
a good man, Barry.

846
00:50:37,302 --> 00:50:41,872
You're really doing this to me
on my birthday, Mom?

847
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:45,243
What are you doing?
You want to turn on
all this now?

848
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:49,347
I am the most successful thing
to ever come from this family.

849
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:52,883
All right? This is everything
that you've wanted.

850
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:54,719
This is everything
that Dad's wanted.

851
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:56,687
This is everything that
I've wanted
for my entire life.

852
00:50:56,821 --> 00:51:00,591
I mean, come on, I control
a $300 million company.

853
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,860
When I was downstairs,
blowing out
my birthday candles,

854
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:05,496
I couldn't even think of
anythingto wish for,
because I already have...

855
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,198
You don't have anything.

856
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:10,301
You don't have anything,
because you don't
have morality!

857
00:51:12,337 --> 00:51:13,704
I don't have...

858
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:18,709
You don't have God.

859
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:21,112
"God"?

860
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:29,053
How much is God? I'll buy God.

861
00:51:59,384 --> 00:52:02,387
No, no, no.

862
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:06,691
Look, this is ancient history.

863
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:08,526
The banks and my investors
know about this.

864
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:11,128
A few dishonest
carpet cleaners
false-billed some customers.

865
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:12,630
I fired them
and paid everyone back.

866
00:52:12,763 --> 00:52:14,665
I don't see
what the problem is.

867
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:18,002
BROKER: The problem is that
stock prices respond
to news reports.

868
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,104
And your stock is
already down half a point.

869
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:22,039
There's a lot of pressure
to sell the shorts, Barry...

870
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:25,443
Okay. Well,
then hold them off! Okay?
Forget the shorts!

871
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:28,846
I'm gonna...

872
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,748
I'm issuing a press release
for this afternoon

873
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,250
that'll clear
this whole thing up.

874
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,985
Our stock will be back up
to normal in no time.

875
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:39,324
I have to go.
I'll call you back.

876
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:42,993
First Bank of
Santa Barbara is

877
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:45,896
calling in their
$7 million loan
because of the article.

878
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:51,369
What about
NorthRidge National?
The same.

879
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:56,140
That's nine million bucks,
Mikey.

880
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:58,075
Barry, there's one more thing.

881
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,347
Saxon sold all of his shares.

882
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,514
He what?

883
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:07,818
Okay.

884
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,489
Mike, I need you
to do something for me,
all right?

885
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:14,492
I need you to draft
a press release, okay?

886
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:17,495
Say that Payne Cameron has
fully investigated
all of these charges

887
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:19,397
and cleared ZZZZ Best
of any wrongdoing.

888
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,098
Are you kidding me?

889
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,469
Just do it.

890
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:32,843
Amy?

891
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:34,712
Amy!

892
00:53:36,414 --> 00:53:37,548
Amy!

893
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:38,749
People keep
calling us, Barry.

894
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:40,485
Thank you
for the observation.

895
00:53:40,618 --> 00:53:43,921
Amy, now listen, I need you...
I need you to...

896
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:48,359
I need you to schedule
a press conference
for this afternoon, okay?

897
00:53:48,493 --> 00:53:50,194
How do I do that?

898
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:52,930
Time to earn
your paycheck, Amy. Go!

899
00:53:58,436 --> 00:53:59,537
This is Barry.

900
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:11,181
Hey! Look on
the bright side. All right?

901
00:54:11,316 --> 00:54:12,883
At least they're only talking
about credit card fraud,

902
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:15,720
not the restoration jobs,
right?

903
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:18,222
Mr. Minkow,
can you comment on why

904
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:20,325
your stock went down
four points today?

905
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:22,627
Absolutely. See, that was
a reaction
to the LA Times story

906
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,330
about a past problem we had
with some dishonest
carpet cleaners.

907
00:54:25,463 --> 00:54:27,532
The banks and our investors
already knew about this.

908
00:54:27,665 --> 00:54:32,102
But is it true that the SEC
has ordered an investigation
of ZZZZ Best?

909
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:34,472
I'm unaware of
any such investigation.

910
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,307
Your prospectus states that

911
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:39,510
you completed a $7 million
restoration project
in Sacramento

912
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:42,246
and yet, ZZZZ Best never
filed a permit
for such construction.

913
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,350
And in fact, ZZZZ Best
doesn't even hold
a contractor's license.

914
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:46,951
How do you explain that?

915
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,757
I'm going to have to
refer that question
to our legal staff.

916
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,291
You know,
that's all for today.

917
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:56,427
I'm so sorry. I have to go.
Thank you all.

918
00:54:56,561 --> 00:54:59,397
Mr. Minkow, how do you feel
about Payne Cameron resigning?

919
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:03,167
We have
more questions, Mr. Minkow.

920
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,338
We are here, live,
on ZZZZ Best's property.
Barry Minkow...

921
00:55:18,516 --> 00:55:21,251
I can't believe
that Payne Cameron resigned.

922
00:55:21,386 --> 00:55:23,921
What did you think
was going to happen, Barry?

923
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:29,694
What's that supposed to mean?

924
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:34,699
It's over, man. It's over.

925
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,567
No, it's not.

926
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:40,371
No, it's not over.
I can fix this.
Okay

927
00:55:40,505 --> 00:55:41,972
I can fix this
just like I fixed everything.

928
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:43,508
If I fixed it before
I can fix it...

929
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:46,043
Barry, you can't fix this.
Yes, I can!

930
00:55:47,612 --> 00:55:49,046
Do you still not get it?

931
00:55:50,415 --> 00:55:52,617
You can't climb out
of this one, Barry.

932
00:55:54,985 --> 00:55:57,722
What do you know, huh, Mike?

933
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:02,993
You have no idea what it takes
to build something like this.

934
00:56:03,127 --> 00:56:05,963
Yeah... You know,
actually, I do.

935
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:07,698
You know...

936
00:56:07,832 --> 00:56:13,938
All it takes is
an incredible ability
to lie.

937
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:17,442
I mean,
that's all you did, Barry.

938
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:20,745
You're a phony.
You used everyone.

939
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:23,481
I used people?

940
00:56:24,649 --> 00:56:25,850
You used people.

941
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:29,454
You used me for money,
and popularity.

942
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:31,489
You sucked me dry, man.
Are you serious?

943
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:33,290
Absolutely!

944
00:56:33,424 --> 00:56:36,594
You know,
for somebody so smart,
you can be really stupid.

945
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,095
You...

946
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:41,432
You are a loser!

947
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:43,868
You betrayed me.
You were a loser
when I met you in high school.

948
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,536
I'm done.
You're a loser now,

949
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:47,071
and you'll always be
a loser!
I'm done with you.

950
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:49,574
I'm done with you.
Barry.

951
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:51,776
I'm done with you!

952
00:56:54,011 --> 00:57:00,017
You lying, self-centered,
backstabbing son of a bitch.
I'm done with you!

953
00:57:16,701 --> 00:57:18,469
Payne Cameron's team
was pretty angry.

954
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:20,237
They said
the press release was a lie.

955
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,474
They said they never
investigated the charges.

956
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:27,444
Is that true?

957
00:57:32,483 --> 00:57:34,418
Anyway, the phone's ringing
off the hook.

958
00:57:34,552 --> 00:57:39,690
The Journal, the Times,
everyone wants to speak
with you.

959
00:58:07,552 --> 00:58:11,922
Barry, what do you
want me to do?

960
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:13,758
I'll be back in a hour.

961
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:30,474
Mr. Minkow,
you are a dangerous man.

962
00:58:30,608 --> 00:58:33,978
You do not have a conscience.

963
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:39,984
You have been convicted
of 57 counts of fraud,
Mr. Minkow,

964
00:58:40,117 --> 00:58:47,925
and you are hereby ordered
to serve a term of 25 years
in jail.

965
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:50,027
And you are further ordered

966
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,331
to make restitution of
$26 million
to the individuals,

967
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:57,201
some of whom
you see here today,

968
00:58:57,334 --> 00:59:02,873
whose lives you have
severely impacted
by your actions...

969
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:10,347
The banks and the companies
you pulled into
your elaborate scheme.

970
00:59:14,418 --> 00:59:16,186
This court is adjourned.

971
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:49,119
You know,
the 2.5 million people

972
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,155
that are busting
the seams of our prisons,

973
00:59:51,288 --> 00:59:54,058
both state and federally
across the U.S.,

974
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:56,393
all of us had one thing
in common.

975
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,462
None of us ever planned
on being there.

976
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:03,233
We all started
with the best of intentions.

977
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:06,336
I just wanted to be accepted.

978
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:12,342
But it was that vehicle
that got me that acceptance
that swallowed me whole.

979
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:18,082
You see, as far back
as I can remember,
I was dubbed "the whiz kid,"

980
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:21,485
and I had everything
I ever wanted.

981
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,722
Until it all came
crashing down.

982
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:27,958
Until I realized that
my whole life was a con.

983
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:32,730
One big giant con.

984
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:37,467
Barry was compelled,
compelled to play himself
in the film,

985
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:41,571
because that's the only way
he could reach
the final completion

986
01:00:41,706 --> 01:00:43,607
of being the hero
in his own story.

987
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:47,244
It was not enough to have
an A-list actor.
It had to be him.

988
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:49,914
The acting that Barry did
in the film,

989
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,216
was, I thought,
very, very, very good.

990
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:55,252
I know when he wanted to
make this movie...

991
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:57,888
There again, I said,
"Barry, be very,
very careful."

992
01:00:58,022 --> 01:01:00,257
I certainly advised him
not to play himself.

993
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,592
I said,
"You're making a mistake."

994
01:01:02,727 --> 01:01:05,963
Sorry. Hold on. There you go.

995
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:10,634
There we go.

996
01:01:12,236 --> 01:01:14,138
Mind if I smoke?

997
01:01:14,271 --> 01:01:15,472
No, go ahead.

998
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:17,541
I don't smoke.
I mean, not anymore.

999
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:20,845
I was just curious
what a preacher felt
about that.

1000
01:01:20,978 --> 01:01:23,881
But now, unfortunately,
I'm hooked on these.

1001
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:28,552
I got to go to rehab
for these. Want one?

1002
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,121
No.
It's the red one.

1003
01:01:31,255 --> 01:01:32,556
Go ahead. No.

1004
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:35,726
What are you thinking about?

1005
01:01:36,761 --> 01:01:37,728
Nah.

1006
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,765
Peanut.

1007
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:41,999
What's that?

1008
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:43,901
James "Peanut" Long.

1009
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,670
The reason they call me
the Jailhouse Preacher.

1010
01:01:46,804 --> 01:01:51,208
Oh. You're gonna tell me
how you found Jesus?

1011
01:01:51,341 --> 01:01:53,277
I didn't find Jesus.

1012
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:57,581
He found me in the form of
a 250-pound black guy.

1013
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:01,451
* Yeah

1014
01:02:04,855 --> 01:02:06,390
* uh-huh

1015
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:12,462
* It's a matter of life
or a matter after of death *

1016
01:02:12,596 --> 01:02:14,631
Not bad for a guy your size.

1017
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,467
Size ain't nothing.

1018
01:02:18,502 --> 01:02:20,337
The body is your temple.

1019
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:25,976
Muscles ain't strength.

1020
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:33,517
Real strength is in here.

1021
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:40,290
You know,
the most dangerous part
of your story

1022
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:42,226
is that throughout
the whole ordeal

1023
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:43,760
you actually
convinced yourself

1024
01:02:43,894 --> 01:02:46,630
that you were helping
hundreds of employees,

1025
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,332
when in reality,
you were just...

1026
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:51,035
Helping myself.
That's all I was doing.

1027
01:02:51,168 --> 01:02:55,139
Hindsight is 20/20,
and look where it got me.

1028
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:57,541
Locked up in a prison cell.

1029
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,978
Well, we're both locked up.

1030
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:04,281
Difference is,
I'm at peace with
what I've done.

1031
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:05,715
And I'm getting there.

1032
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:07,717
You're pretending
to get there.

1033
01:03:10,187 --> 01:03:11,355
You don't think I'm sincere?

1034
01:03:11,488 --> 01:03:13,790
I think you're trying
to find the Lord,

1035
01:03:13,924 --> 01:03:15,592
so you can hang out
with the Jesus freaks

1036
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:19,129
instead of the skinheads
to make it in here.

1037
01:03:19,263 --> 01:03:21,465
Whatever.
Yeah. Whatever.

1038
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:24,835
Why do you come to church
on Sunday

1039
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:29,239
Is it because you're really
trying to change your life?

1040
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:31,641
Or is it just another
Barry Minkow con?

1041
01:03:31,775 --> 01:03:35,645
* What if I told you...
A second chance to live *

1042
01:03:35,779 --> 01:03:37,747
One thing to remember
is the fraud artist

1043
01:03:37,882 --> 01:03:40,050
doesn't see himself
as a criminal.

1044
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:44,021
The fraud is merely a means
to a well-justified end.

1045
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:47,057
Once the scheme works,
everybody gets paid off,

1046
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:48,725
nobody gets hurt.

1047
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:50,794
Voila.

1048
01:03:51,628 --> 01:03:54,464
Okay, let's move on here.

1049
01:03:56,934 --> 01:04:01,238
You know as well as I do,
when the devil comes at you
at first,

1050
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:05,242
he looks good, sounds good,
feels good.

1051
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:09,546
Then, when it's too late,
the beast comes out.

1052
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,515
You got that right.

1053
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,751
Where were you 11 years ago?

1054
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:18,655
Well, I had a lot of
growing up to do.

1055
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:23,093
Like I said,
ain't no accidents in life.

1056
01:04:23,227 --> 01:04:25,829
We bought shares
for five cents apiece,

1057
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:27,464
then dumped them on the market

1058
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:29,866
when it hit 12 and 13 bucks.

1059
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,502
That was the part
that was illegal.

1060
01:04:32,636 --> 01:04:35,772
So, it was Saxon
that got you involved
in the penny stocks, right?

1061
01:04:35,906 --> 01:04:38,142
And that's when he turned
his Wall Street connections

1062
01:04:38,275 --> 01:04:40,777
onto the stock,
they bought blocks of it,

1063
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:42,712
the price shot through
the roof

1064
01:04:42,846 --> 01:04:46,250
and I was worth
millions instantly.

1065
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:47,851
Insider trading.

1066
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:57,861
Hey!

1067
01:04:58,428 --> 01:04:59,663
Hey!

1068
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:03,800
Hey, you need to
leave him alone.

1069
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:05,902
Yeah? You need to
mind your own business.

1070
01:05:06,036 --> 01:05:07,571
Hey, I don't want any trouble.

1071
01:05:08,672 --> 01:05:10,807
I said
mind your own business.

1072
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:13,543
I will when you let him go.

1073
01:05:13,677 --> 01:05:15,345
Too bad.
Can't you hear?

1074
01:05:15,479 --> 01:05:17,547
Finish your shower.
I said take a walk, man.
Take a walk.

1075
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:19,950
I don't think so.
Don't think so?

1076
01:05:22,386 --> 01:05:27,057
I know I'm not seeing
what I think I'm seeing.

1077
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:36,266
'Cause if you're trying
to hurt him,
you're trying to hurt me.

1078
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,701
Let's get out of here.

1079
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:45,909
Lord Jesus,
I want to thank you

1080
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:48,878
for making me
a God-fearing man.

1081
01:05:49,013 --> 01:05:51,648
And having me
not beat anyone's ass.

1082
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,851
In Jesus' name, Amen.

1083
01:06:01,725 --> 01:06:03,593
I'm proud of you, whiz kid.

1084
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:05,795
You did all the work.

1085
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:08,332
I don't know why
you'd be proud of me.

1086
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:10,067
Changing.

1087
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:14,304
You helped a weaker brother
who was outnumbered.

1088
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:19,409
Shows that you're changing
from your selfish-ass,
self-centered ways.

1089
01:06:19,543 --> 01:06:23,780
Remember. The Lord always
looks out for the underdog.

1090
01:06:25,782 --> 01:06:29,286
BARRY: I don't know
if it was Peanut
or the broken nose.

1091
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:33,057
I guess God has a way
of taking care of the details.

1092
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:39,896
And it was at this moment
that life took on new clarity
for me.

1093
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:42,699
See, to win the game,
I had to stay in the pocket,

1094
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,001
and face the pain.

1095
01:06:45,135 --> 01:06:48,705
It was then I learned
that to win in life

1096
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,741
meant no more backing down.

1097
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,711
No more shortcuts.

1098
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:57,847
No more compromises.

1099
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,384
No more lies.

1100
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:05,889
And no more cons.

1101
01:07:36,453 --> 01:07:38,488
How you feeling?

1102
01:07:38,622 --> 01:07:42,426
DAN: I question whether
some of the stuff he did
was for the movie

1103
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,060
or the story of the movie.

1104
01:07:44,194 --> 01:07:46,496
I never felt better.
Thank you.

1105
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:49,299
DAN: I question whether
Peanut was a real person
or not.

1106
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:51,401
It's a pretty good throw.

1107
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:54,771
MIKEY: I don't think
Barry could throw
a football nine feet.

1108
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,141
Truth plus time equal trust.

1109
01:07:57,274 --> 01:08:01,945
A lot of truth, over a long
period of time equals trust.

1110
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,948
And no shortcuts
to that equation either,
you know?

1111
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:19,329
Yeah, well,
thanks for the time.

1112
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:26,536
BARRY: Like I said
from the beginning,

1113
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:29,639
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life
in witness protection.

1114
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:34,344
I'm not going to testify
against Mr. Saxon,
not now, not ever.

1115
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:36,146
Excuse me.

1116
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,815
JERRI: I never felt
that Barry
was rehabilitated.

1117
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:42,352
FRANZESE: I believe
his transformation
was real.

1118
01:08:42,486 --> 01:08:47,257
MIKEY: Everyone in prison knew
that if you found Jesus

1119
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:51,795
that would look good
on your record
to maybe get early release.

1120
01:08:51,928 --> 01:08:54,097
BARRY:
Truth plus time equal trust.

1121
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:58,968
A lot of truth,
over a long period of time
equals trust.

1122
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:01,738
And no shortcuts
to that equation either,
you know.

1123
01:09:05,275 --> 01:09:09,279
All right. We've heard
the testimony.

1124
01:09:09,413 --> 01:09:14,150
Now, it's time to decide
based on Mr. Minkow's
present character.

1125
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:31,435
FRANZESE: You know, he came
out of prison raring to go.

1126
01:09:31,568 --> 01:09:35,205
But I didn't see it coming
with the church,
quite honestly.

1127
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:40,577
Mr. Minkow, we have
gone through your application

1128
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,046
and enjoyed your guest sermon,

1129
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:48,685
but now we'd like
to hear the answer
to the following question.

1130
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:50,554
Why should we hire you?

1131
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:56,025
Well, on paper,
you shouldn't.

1132
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,362
Especially when you
consider the fact that

1133
01:09:58,495 --> 01:10:01,865
the other 199 applicants
aren't convicted felons.

1134
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:09,839
If you hire me,
I can promise you one thing,

1135
01:10:09,973 --> 01:10:12,576
that no one will work harder,
if for no other reason

1136
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:16,480
than out of gratitude
for being given
the opportunity

1137
01:10:16,613 --> 01:10:18,815
to pastor such a great church.

1138
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:24,454
You see, I'm naive enough
to believe that

1139
01:10:24,588 --> 01:10:28,057
if you want to find
the best employee,
the best place to find one

1140
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:30,527
is someone who's
just come out of prison,

1141
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,296
who didn't fail jail.

1142
01:10:33,497 --> 01:10:36,433
Who owes society
for what they've...

1143
01:10:38,502 --> 01:10:40,437
I've done.

1144
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:46,410
And what better way
for a church to show their
belief in the gospel of grace

1145
01:10:46,543 --> 01:10:51,214
than have a broken vessel
like me proclaim that truth

1146
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:53,583
from the pulpit
of this very church.

1147
01:10:53,717 --> 01:10:57,921
And from
a marketing standpoint,
imagine a slogan,

1148
01:10:58,054 --> 01:10:59,623
"Community Bible Church,

1149
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:03,627
the only church
where the pastor
is far worse than you."

1150
01:11:07,464 --> 01:11:09,966
FRANZESE: I'll tell ya,
I don't know if you ever
saw him in church,

1151
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,936
in front of his congregation,
he was masterful.

1152
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:15,605
I mean, he had them
in the palm of his hands.

1153
01:11:15,739 --> 01:11:18,041
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

1154
01:11:20,744 --> 01:11:22,145
Hi.
Hi.

1155
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,748
Nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming.

1156
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:28,952
First time here?
Yes. Wonderful sermon,
Pastor Minkow.

1157
01:11:29,085 --> 01:11:31,721
Pastor Barry, please.
And this is my wife Lisa.

1158
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:33,156
Hi, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

1159
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,892
Hi, I'm Ellen Scott
and this is my husband Don.

1160
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,527
Don, it's good to meet you.

1161
01:11:37,661 --> 01:11:39,863
We drove down
from Santa Barbara.
Santa Barbara?

1162
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:43,132
Well, my sermons don't merit
that kind of sacrifice,
but thank you anyway.

1163
01:11:43,266 --> 01:11:46,135
We're here
for another reason.

1164
01:11:48,372 --> 01:11:53,877
The past 10 years, we put
all our retirement savings
in a hedge fund.

1165
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:57,046
About $250,000.

1166
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,550
I earned that money,
working 31 years
as a longshoreman.

1167
01:12:00,684 --> 01:12:07,156
Now we're worried about
the fund and thought you
could check it out.

1168
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:08,892
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
I'm a pastor.

1169
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:11,528
I don't really know
a whole lot
about hedge funds.

1170
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:16,332
I'm really sorry. I...
Look, why are you concerned?

1171
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:19,035
The manager
just moved his office
to the Bahamas.

1172
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,870
How long
have they been around?

1173
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:25,675
Twenty years. They're
worth around $800 million,
about 2,000 investors.

1174
01:12:25,809 --> 01:12:27,844
Twenty years, $800 million...

1175
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:30,013
Sounds like you don't have
a whole lot to worry
about there.

1176
01:12:30,146 --> 01:12:34,851
Please, would you check on it?
I brought the prospectus.

1177
01:12:34,984 --> 01:12:37,320
Why me? I'm not an expert
in these kind of things.

1178
01:12:37,454 --> 01:12:41,525
Everything was fine
until I tried to withdraw
the money.

1179
01:12:41,658 --> 01:12:46,496
They've been telling me
that it's in process
for three months.

1180
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:51,334
I told my nephew about it
and he suggested I see you.

1181
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:55,338
Your nephew.
Who's your nephew?

1182
01:13:01,911 --> 01:13:03,079
Mike?

1183
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:07,050
Mike

1184
01:13:08,852 --> 01:13:11,555
You look great.
You look great.

1185
01:13:11,688 --> 01:13:13,590
Not even you can
pull off that lie.

1186
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:17,393
Well, I'm not exactly
winning any beauty
contests myself.

1187
01:13:17,527 --> 01:13:19,095
How you been?

1188
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,831
I'll be a lot better
if you tell me you can
help out my uncle.

1189
01:13:21,965 --> 01:13:23,366
Yeah, well...

1190
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:27,203
This hedge-fund guy, Lewis,
right, he's telling me

1191
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:30,674
he's getting monthly gains
of 1.5% to 3.5%.

1192
01:13:30,807 --> 01:13:34,711
Yeah, I don't think anybody's
quite that good.

1193
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:36,212
Hedge fund, I...

1194
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:37,981
You know, I got that letter
you wrote to me from prison,

1195
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:39,949
apologizing for what you did.

1196
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:43,319
Were you lying then
or are you lying now?

1197
01:13:43,453 --> 01:13:47,390
Look, Mike, I'm not
the same guy I was before.

1198
01:13:47,524 --> 01:13:50,794
I'm married.
I got the church.
I got twins.

1199
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,830
I teach the FBI
in fraud prevention
in Quantico. I...

1200
01:13:53,963 --> 01:13:57,567
I don't really want to hear
about the good deeds
of my old schoolmates.

1201
01:13:57,701 --> 01:13:59,603
You can tell me you're working
with lepers on an island,

1202
01:13:59,736 --> 01:14:03,072
my opinion of you
wouldn't change, Barry. Okay?

1203
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:06,042
I'll believe the change
when I see it.

1204
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:09,713
Anybody who's ever been
in a financial dealing with me
has lived to regret it.

1205
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:11,280
You know that.

1206
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:14,050
Yeah, I'll take my chances.

1207
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:16,986
Besides, your rates
are unbeatable.

1208
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:22,391
Rates?
I don't have any rates.

1209
01:14:22,526 --> 01:14:23,627
Exactly.

1210
01:14:26,663 --> 01:14:30,834
MIKEY: It became just too much
of a temptation for him.

1211
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:34,103
JERRI: Barry wanted
to kind of do
the Catch Me If You Can.

1212
01:14:34,237 --> 01:14:37,641
DAN: It was impressive.
I mean, he really
knew his stuff.

1213
01:14:37,774 --> 01:14:39,543
And there you have
the six red flags for fraud.

1214
01:14:39,676 --> 01:14:42,178
Should you choose to
commit those to memory,

1215
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,713
you will be able to stop
the next Barry Minkow

1216
01:14:43,847 --> 01:14:45,749
before he is the next
Barry Minkow.

1217
01:14:45,882 --> 01:14:47,717
That's all I have today.
Thanks for joining me.

1218
01:14:49,853 --> 01:14:54,390
DAN: I think Barry viewed
himself as a hero
in a sort of twisted way.

1219
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,995
Well, well, well.

1220
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:00,697
If it ain't the preacher man.

1221
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:03,366
Good to see you, Smooth.
I see the streets
have treated you well.

1222
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,534
You look good, my friend.

1223
01:15:04,668 --> 01:15:06,269
Yeah, right.

1224
01:15:06,402 --> 01:15:09,038
You get a chance
to look at the copy
of the prospectus I sent you?

1225
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:12,275
Does your PO officer know
that you're associating
with an ex

1226
01:15:12,408 --> 01:15:14,010
'Cause I will tell him.

1227
01:15:14,143 --> 01:15:17,180
I'm just trying
to figure out how this
Lewis guy has managed to

1228
01:15:17,313 --> 01:15:20,784
run a Ponzi scheme
for 20 years
without it imploding.

1229
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:24,621
Either I'm missing something,
or he's a financial genius.

1230
01:15:24,754 --> 01:15:26,355
Little of both.

1231
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:31,260
Can I get a beer
and a whiskey, please?

1232
01:15:35,999 --> 01:15:38,868
Look, I need your expertise.

1233
01:15:39,002 --> 01:15:41,137
You're the best there is.

1234
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:49,278
You already got
what you're looking for.

1235
01:15:53,817 --> 01:15:55,685
In the prospectus.

1236
01:15:55,819 --> 01:16:00,056
They practically advertise
for people to invest
their retirement money.

1237
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:02,125
Yeah, so?

1238
01:16:02,258 --> 01:16:05,995
When people take their
IRA money and put it into
a fund like this one here,

1239
01:16:06,129 --> 01:16:09,933
there are heavy penalties
if you pull out before
you're 57 and a half.

1240
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:14,470
They can invest the money
all they want,
they just can't pull it out.

1241
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:18,608
The perfect ingredient
for the successful
Ponzi scheme.

1242
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:24,848
JERRI: Barry becoming
a fraud buster
didn't surprise me.

1243
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:29,052
You know, I always wondered
if going undercover was
an opportunity for him

1244
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:33,690
to reenact his favorite
'80s detective shows,
and he had many,

1245
01:16:33,823 --> 01:16:38,394
or was it part
of a larger plan to actually
do good this time?

1246
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:47,236
I don't know.
I mean, I don't know.

1247
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:50,674
Let me explain this to you.
There's just
a slight difference

1248
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:53,209
between lecturing these guys
and dodging bullets for them.

1249
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:56,512
And it's not like you've been
trained exactly.
Not to a fine edge.

1250
01:16:56,646 --> 01:17:00,249
Look, the guy has been
around for over 20 years
and he's a ghost.

1251
01:17:00,383 --> 01:17:01,718
No license
to sell securities,

1252
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:03,386
no assets held
in the fund's name, nothing.

1253
01:17:03,519 --> 01:17:05,088
Who the hell is this guy?

1254
01:17:05,221 --> 01:17:07,123
It's the only way.

1255
01:17:07,256 --> 01:17:10,626
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll send Matt
down to the Bahamas,

1256
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,528
and he'll record
the meeting.

1257
01:17:12,662 --> 01:17:15,665
If there's any misreps,
we'll move forward from there.

1258
01:17:15,799 --> 01:17:17,000
How's that?

1259
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:19,402
Uh, just one last thing is,

1260
01:17:19,535 --> 01:17:22,471
I need Quantico to create me
a bogus bank statement

1261
01:17:22,605 --> 01:17:26,242
showing the church
has $5 million parked
in a money market.

1262
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:29,645
Wait a minute, how do you
know this guy's gonna show up
in the first place?

1263
01:17:29,779 --> 01:17:33,182
Any Ponzi scheme operator
desperate for new cash

1264
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:37,053
would do whatever it took
to get their hands
on new cash. He'll show.

1265
01:17:37,186 --> 01:17:37,854
Uh-huh.

1266
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:42,692
So, you're asking me to give
the carpet guy

1267
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:47,731
this bank statement
for $5 million.

1268
01:17:47,864 --> 01:17:48,965
What, am I crazy?

1269
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:52,335
Ernest Hemingway said,
"The only way you can learn

1270
01:17:52,468 --> 01:17:55,571
"to trust someone,
is to trust 'em."

1271
01:17:55,705 --> 01:17:57,373
Ernest Hemingway said that?

1272
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:01,544
I think so.
Could have been Churchill.
Or him.

1273
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,279
MIKEY: "Barry,
you don't understand.

1274
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:05,248
"You're going undercover,
you're not a cop.

1275
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:06,983
"You're a pastor."

1276
01:18:07,116 --> 01:18:09,218
He said, "Listen,
I'm uncovering fraud.

1277
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:14,657
"I'm helping people
that are getting scammed
and victimized by others."

1278
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:17,560
I said, "Barry,
working so closely
with the government,

1279
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,797
"if you're wrong one time,
you're in trouble."

1280
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,199
You say Don Scott's
a friend of yours?

1281
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:25,268
Yeah, he's a member
of our church,

1282
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:27,837
and the church has been
growing so much lately

1283
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:30,106
that we've established
a building fund,

1284
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:33,142
to purchase some land
to accommodate the growth.

1285
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:36,312
We wanted to invest
that money, have it working
for us until we build.

1286
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:39,883
Well, it would grow here,
I assure you. How much
do you have to invest?

1287
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:42,451
A little over $5 million.

1288
01:18:42,585 --> 01:18:46,455
Those returns that
you've been generating,
can they be corroborated?

1289
01:18:46,589 --> 01:18:50,693
Yes. We earn
18% to 40% annual.
A 20-year track record.

1290
01:18:50,827 --> 01:18:53,396
And 800 million?
Eight hundred million.
Yes, correct.

1291
01:18:53,529 --> 01:18:55,631
$800 million fund.

1292
01:18:55,765 --> 01:18:58,401
You just gotta forgive me.
Numbers like that get me
a little bit nervous.

1293
01:18:58,534 --> 01:19:01,938
You are aware of my past,
I was convicted
of securities fraud?

1294
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:03,739
I read about you, yes.

1295
01:19:03,873 --> 01:19:07,143
I like how you disclose it
up-front on your church's
website, too.

1296
01:19:07,276 --> 01:19:10,780
I'll be happy
to work with you.
We all make mistakes.

1297
01:19:10,914 --> 01:19:13,182
You were just a kid.
You got greedy.

1298
01:19:13,316 --> 01:19:17,420
I have
the money market account,
bank statement

1299
01:19:17,553 --> 01:19:20,790
to prove that the money is
waiting there,
you can call the bank.

1300
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:22,792
It's clear funds,
waiting to wire.

1301
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:25,895
Well, thank you for coming,
Pastor. I look forward
to working with you.

1302
01:19:26,029 --> 01:19:27,663
Well, I do appreciate
you seeing me,

1303
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:31,901
and just as soon as you
send Don Scott his $250,000,

1304
01:19:32,035 --> 01:19:34,570
we'll wire these funds
right to your bank account.

1305
01:19:36,973 --> 01:19:41,444
It's just that, Mr. Scott
had requested
a $250,000 withdrawal,

1306
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:43,279
and apparently in your move
to the Bahamas...

1307
01:19:43,412 --> 01:19:46,415
You tell Mr. Scott,
he'll have his money
in 24 hours.

1308
01:19:46,549 --> 01:19:48,684
Thank you for coming.
Terrific. Mr. Lewis,

1309
01:19:48,818 --> 01:19:50,954
thank you so much
for your time.

1310
01:19:53,589 --> 01:19:55,291
Well, hey, Don,
good to see you.

1311
01:19:55,424 --> 01:19:59,963
Hey, Barry. Well,
Lewis wired me half
my money this morning.

1312
01:20:00,096 --> 01:20:02,098
Half?
Yeah.

1313
01:20:02,231 --> 01:20:06,970
He said that the custodian
of American Investment
didn't put in my paperwork,

1314
01:20:07,103 --> 01:20:09,138
so he sent it
out of his own pocket,

1315
01:20:09,272 --> 01:20:13,376
and he said he'd wire me
the other half very soon.

1316
01:20:13,509 --> 01:20:16,212
You know, Don, I may
have underestimated just how

1317
01:20:16,345 --> 01:20:18,581
strapped for cash
Mr. Lewis is.

1318
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:24,687
Why would he risk
five million new fresh dollars

1319
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,456
by sending only half
of what he promised
just days ago?

1320
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:28,858
There's only
one answer to that.

1321
01:20:28,992 --> 01:20:30,693
And that is,
he doesn't have
the full amount,

1322
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:34,397
and he is much more
cash-strapped
than I first anticipated.

1323
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,365
You're beginning
to worry me, Barry.

1324
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:40,603
Look, Don, I don't want you
to worry about a thing.
I got this under control.

1325
01:20:40,736 --> 01:20:43,706
Okay? Trust me on this.
It'll be okay.

1326
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,674
I'll take care of it.

1327
01:20:51,314 --> 01:20:52,315
Hello?

1328
01:20:52,448 --> 01:20:54,918
Pastor Minkow, Derek Lewis.

1329
01:20:55,051 --> 01:20:57,520
My understanding was
you were going to deposit
your church money

1330
01:20:57,653 --> 01:21:00,289
two days after Mr. Scott
got his withdrawal fund.

1331
01:21:00,423 --> 01:21:04,894
It's my understanding
that Mr. Scott only received
half of his funds.

1332
01:21:05,028 --> 01:21:06,495
Well, there was a problem
with the paperwork.

1333
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:08,597
He'll get the balance
tomorrow or the next day.

1334
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:13,436
Terrific. And once he does,
the church will wire the funds
as I had promised.

1335
01:21:13,569 --> 01:21:16,005
Hey, that's my money.
I control who gets paid
and when.

1336
01:21:16,139 --> 01:21:18,307
No ex-con's gonna
run a number on me.

1337
01:21:18,441 --> 01:21:21,477
You know something,
Mr. Lewis, you're not as smart
as you think you are.

1338
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:23,112
I know exactly
what you're doing.

1339
01:21:23,246 --> 01:21:26,182
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

1340
01:21:26,315 --> 01:21:29,352
The beauty of grace is that
good people don't go
to heaven,

1341
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:30,753
forgiven people
go to heaven.

1342
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,655
That's the...
Barry, what is going on?

1343
01:21:32,788 --> 01:21:36,025
Excuse me a second.
Just relax for a minute.
Excuse me.

1344
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:38,827
Just relax for a minute,
would you, Mike

1345
01:21:38,962 --> 01:21:40,629
I'm gonna punch you
in the face

1346
01:21:40,763 --> 01:21:42,565
the next time
you tell me to relax,
all right?

1347
01:21:42,698 --> 01:21:45,935
Derek Lewis
is suing my uncle
for $10 million,

1348
01:21:46,069 --> 01:21:48,537
for fraud
and misrepresentation.

1349
01:21:48,671 --> 01:21:50,739
Yeah, I know.
He's doing the same thing
to me and the church.

1350
01:21:50,873 --> 01:21:53,242
The cost for the suit
is gonna wipe them out!

1351
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:56,712
Okay, I need you to stop doing
what you are doing. Okay?

1352
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:59,382
They've got half their
money back. That's as good
as they're gonna get.

1353
01:21:59,515 --> 01:22:00,349
Just walk away.

1354
01:22:00,483 --> 01:22:02,085
I can't, Mike.

1355
01:22:02,218 --> 01:22:04,887
There's a lot more at stake
than what you're thinking.

1356
01:22:05,021 --> 01:22:07,323
It's gonna be okay.
Just trust me.

1357
01:22:07,456 --> 01:22:09,692
Trust you.
Where have I
heard that before?

1358
01:22:09,825 --> 01:22:12,728
Trusting you
ruined my life, Barry.

1359
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:16,565
FRANZESE: Barry's intentions
were always good,
at least according to him.

1360
01:22:16,699 --> 01:22:18,734
But he had a lack
of regard for the law

1361
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:20,869
and eventually,
that became an issue.

1362
01:22:21,004 --> 01:22:23,539
But Barry was
very hard to say no to.

1363
01:22:25,308 --> 01:22:28,177
You don't have to convince me
your intentions are good,
Barry.

1364
01:22:28,311 --> 01:22:32,148
I know you've been
making restitution,
even from prison.

1365
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:34,950
I owe this community
a lot more than just money,
Michael, you know that.

1366
01:22:35,084 --> 01:22:38,721
Yes, but what you're
asking me to do, I cannot do.

1367
01:22:38,854 --> 01:22:40,589
I might lose my job.

1368
01:22:40,723 --> 01:22:46,195
Look, Michael,
I got Mr. Lewis on tape
saying he has $800 million

1369
01:22:46,329 --> 01:22:49,465
in his accounts at this bank
and if he does,
that's wonderful.

1370
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:52,068
But if he doesn't,
he's in the process
of destroying

1371
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:55,071
the lives
of thousands of people
in this community.

1372
01:22:55,204 --> 01:22:57,506
I need your help.
I can't just...

1373
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,642
We can't just
let that happen.

1374
01:22:59,775 --> 01:23:02,911
All I want you to do is
check the balances.

1375
01:23:03,046 --> 01:23:05,214
If they're nowhere
near $800 million,

1376
01:23:05,348 --> 01:23:08,551
then just get out
of that chair,
walk over to that window,

1377
01:23:08,684 --> 01:23:11,454
look outside
and then I'll know for sure.

1378
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:16,125
All I need are those balances.
Please, Michael,
I'll leave either way.

1379
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:20,329
All the investment company's
accounts are tied
to this tax ID number.

1380
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:28,003
You have to help me here.
You have to believe in me.

1381
01:23:28,137 --> 01:23:29,338
Please.

1382
01:23:56,665 --> 01:23:58,801
Man, looks like
it's going to rain.

1383
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:07,176
Gamble had me do some
digging the past few days
on my lunch break.

1384
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:09,078
What's this?

1385
01:24:09,212 --> 01:24:12,315
Articles of incorporation
from a Tijuana company
called Olacane.

1386
01:24:12,448 --> 01:24:13,749
It's Dowry's cash cow.

1387
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,752
They get all their
factoring contracts
from there.

1388
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,621
It's run by some guy
named Oliveros.

1389
01:24:18,754 --> 01:24:20,289
They operate out of
300 square feet

1390
01:24:20,423 --> 01:24:23,058
and share a secretary
with three other businesses.

1391
01:24:23,192 --> 01:24:25,394
The restoration equivalent
of my Ponzi scheme.

1392
01:24:25,528 --> 01:24:30,299
No way that
a 300 square-foot office
in Mexico can substantiate

1393
01:24:30,433 --> 01:24:33,068
hundreds of millions
in factoring business.

1394
01:24:33,202 --> 01:24:35,003
Gamble says,
"Merry Christmas."

1395
01:24:37,606 --> 01:24:38,707
Hello?

1396
01:24:38,841 --> 01:24:40,809
Mr. Lewis,
this is Barry Minkow calling.

1397
01:24:40,943 --> 01:24:42,044
How'd you get this number?

1398
01:24:42,178 --> 01:24:43,646
You have your spies.
I have mine.

1399
01:24:43,779 --> 01:24:45,214
What do you want?

1400
01:24:45,348 --> 01:24:46,849
I'd like to meet you in
Los Angeles tomorrow

1401
01:24:46,982 --> 01:24:49,185
and I'd like you to bring
the rest of Don Scott's money.

1402
01:24:49,318 --> 01:24:50,219
You gotta be joking.

1403
01:24:50,353 --> 01:24:52,121
5:00 p.m., LA Resort Hotel.

1404
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:54,757
Unless of course
you'd like me to take
the information I've obtained

1405
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:56,659
and turn it over to the FBI
or the Journal.

1406
01:24:56,792 --> 01:24:58,361
And what do you have
on me, Mr. Minkow?

1407
01:24:58,494 --> 01:25:01,330
There's only $387,000
in your bank accounts

1408
01:25:01,464 --> 01:25:03,399
instead of the $800 million
that you purport to have.

1409
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:04,833
You just wait a minute.

1410
01:25:04,967 --> 01:25:06,935
You, Mr. Lewis,
are running a Ponzi scheme.

1411
01:25:07,069 --> 01:25:09,472
No, you're the ex-con.
You're running the scam.

1412
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:10,806
I'm doing the work of God.

1413
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:11,907
Hey, I said wait a minute.

1414
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,442
Protecting the weak.

1415
01:25:13,576 --> 01:25:17,280
I'll see you tomorrow,
LA Resort Hotel, 5:00 p.m.

1416
01:25:17,413 --> 01:25:19,047
Good night, Mr. Lewis.

1417
01:25:28,924 --> 01:25:31,227
Lisa, I wanted
to tell you something,

1418
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,363
but I wanted to make sure
that it came out right.

1419
01:25:34,497 --> 01:25:35,798
So I wanted to be careful.

1420
01:25:35,931 --> 01:25:41,204
Barry, for once in your life,
don't speak, okay?

1421
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:45,974
Look, I just
want to say that

1422
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:51,347
I see the people
who always second-guess
your motives.

1423
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,518
I see them. I see the people
who always raise an eyebrow.

1424
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:57,986
And I know that
you struggle, okay?

1425
01:25:59,955 --> 01:26:01,457
I know that you
struggle knowing that

1426
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:05,127
most people deep down
will never trust a word
that you say.

1427
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:10,065
I mean, 'cause
let's be real, Barry,

1428
01:26:10,199 --> 01:26:13,202
most people will walk away,
most people are going to
just shake their heads

1429
01:26:13,336 --> 01:26:16,205
and steer clear of you
and think that
you're a con forever.

1430
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:22,478
But that's not me.

1431
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:26,382
I appreciate that
more then you'll ever know.

1432
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:31,920
I got nothing to offer you
but a $26 million
restitution order

1433
01:26:32,054 --> 01:26:34,790
and suspicious glares
and grins every time

1434
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:38,561
I walk by with you
in some public arena.

1435
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:40,296
But I will tell you this,

1436
01:26:42,298 --> 01:26:47,536
if I had to serve
eight Super Bowls
in prison again,

1437
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:50,539
and knew that
you'd be waiting for me
when I got out,

1438
01:26:52,841 --> 01:26:54,910
I would go
right back to prison.

1439
01:27:07,656 --> 01:27:09,258
Look, uh...

1440
01:27:10,626 --> 01:27:12,127
I can do this, right?

1441
01:27:12,261 --> 01:27:15,564
Yeah. I know
you can do this.

1442
01:27:15,698 --> 01:27:16,865
Go get 'em.

1443
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:34,383
I don't trust you, Minkow.

1444
01:27:34,517 --> 01:27:38,053
Hey, I'm here
to work with you.
I'm not a bad guy.

1445
01:27:38,186 --> 01:27:39,755
I'm a liar and a sinner
saved by grace.

1446
01:27:39,888 --> 01:27:41,189
Stop it.

1447
01:27:41,324 --> 01:27:43,392
There's a lot of people
involved with this fund.

1448
01:27:43,526 --> 01:27:45,728
Heavy hitters.
It's not just me.

1449
01:27:45,861 --> 01:27:48,263
Listen, if you hurt me,

1450
01:27:48,397 --> 01:27:51,400
this goes to the FBI
and the Journal.

1451
01:27:51,534 --> 01:27:54,437
I don't want to hurt you.
I just need you to back off.

1452
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:10,553
Well, I guess
this won't be going
to the FBI or the Journal.

1453
01:28:12,721 --> 01:28:16,825
But tell me,
getting this much cash
at this stage of your deal,

1454
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:18,527
it was a bitch, wasn't it?

1455
01:28:18,661 --> 01:28:21,997
When you're giving
18% to 40% a year,
the interest kills you.

1456
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:23,399
Do the math.

1457
01:28:23,532 --> 01:28:26,301
Every day keeps you
a little deeper in the hole.

1458
01:28:26,435 --> 01:28:30,439
I did the math and then I did
eight Super Bowls in prison.

1459
01:28:30,573 --> 01:28:32,274
I'm not a criminal.

1460
01:28:32,408 --> 01:28:35,110
My investors
double their money
every three years.

1461
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:38,113
But I had to make
some risky investments

1462
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:39,848
just to raise some money
for the investors

1463
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:41,584
that didn't use
the trust fund.

1464
01:28:42,885 --> 01:28:44,987
Tough game we're in.

1465
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,823
These hedge funds,
totally unregulated.

1466
01:28:47,956 --> 01:28:49,057
I'll stay afloat.

1467
01:28:49,191 --> 01:28:50,626
I'll get it all back.

1468
01:28:50,759 --> 01:28:54,530
I just need to survive
until one of my deals
pay off big.

1469
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:56,064
And then I'm home free.

1470
01:28:56,198 --> 01:28:58,834
All I need you to do
is be quiet.

1471
01:28:58,967 --> 01:29:02,771
So, no money
left in the fund?

1472
01:29:02,905 --> 01:29:04,373
More or less.

1473
01:29:08,977 --> 01:29:11,814
Olacane just
a front company?

1474
01:29:11,947 --> 01:29:16,051
Olacane? Why are you asking
about Olacane?

1475
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:18,521
BARRY: Just
interested in how...

1476
01:29:18,654 --> 01:29:22,925
Uh, just, you know,
interested in how
other people do

1477
01:29:23,058 --> 01:29:25,928
things like I used to do.

1478
01:29:26,061 --> 01:29:27,530
Look, I've gotta go.

1479
01:29:27,663 --> 01:29:30,466
I hope you fellas enjoy
the rest of your stay
here in LA.

1480
01:29:30,599 --> 01:29:32,668
Catch a Clipper game
or something.

1481
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:38,774
What the...

1482
01:29:38,907 --> 01:29:41,410
Boss...
Check him.

1483
01:29:41,544 --> 01:29:43,879
Shit, cover's blown,
cover's blown.
Move in.

1484
01:29:44,012 --> 01:29:45,481
What's this?

1485
01:29:46,615 --> 01:29:47,683
It's a wire.

1486
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:50,285
You know something?
Screw this job.

1487
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,293
Don's money.

1488
01:30:03,932 --> 01:30:05,133
Come on. Come on.

1489
01:30:06,802 --> 01:30:08,236
Come on.

1490
01:30:17,813 --> 01:30:19,047
Freeze! FBI!

1491
01:30:19,181 --> 01:30:21,450
Drop the case!
Down on the floor.

1492
01:30:23,385 --> 01:30:25,253
Stay right where you are.

1493
01:30:25,387 --> 01:30:27,122
Let's go.
Down to base camp.

1494
01:30:34,362 --> 01:30:37,633
MIKEY: When I heard
Barry was chasing
after bad guys in his movie,

1495
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:40,769
I said, "Come on, Barry.
I mean, let's get real.

1496
01:30:40,903 --> 01:30:42,370
"There's no way you did this.

1497
01:30:42,505 --> 01:30:44,573
"You're not an action hero."

1498
01:30:50,345 --> 01:30:54,950
SCOTT: The FBI did credit
Barry for his multiple efforts
to uncover fraud.

1499
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:57,319
But there was more
to the story.

1500
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:59,221
Hey, genius, come here.
Yeah.

1501
01:30:59,354 --> 01:31:01,456
Let me ask you something.

1502
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:03,526
What would you have done
if you caught those guys?

1503
01:31:03,659 --> 01:31:05,193
They are kind of big,
aren't they?

1504
01:31:06,361 --> 01:31:08,697
I learned in prison,
in a shower of all places,

1505
01:31:08,831 --> 01:31:13,135
that when you
do the right thing,
God takes care of the details.

1506
01:31:16,872 --> 01:31:19,474
Good job, by the way.

1507
01:31:19,608 --> 01:31:20,843
Merry Christmas.

1508
01:31:23,912 --> 01:31:26,048
SCOTT: What's ironic
here is that

1509
01:31:26,181 --> 01:31:31,253
while Barry was bragging
about the $1.6 billion
in fraud he'd uncovered,

1510
01:31:31,386 --> 01:31:33,956
he was hammering companies
whose stock he'd shorted

1511
01:31:34,089 --> 01:31:39,194
in a series of attacks
often based on misleading
or false charges.

1512
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,163
Causing not the companies

1513
01:31:41,296 --> 01:31:46,569
but thousands
of innocent shareholders
to lose well over $3 billion.

1514
01:31:46,702 --> 01:31:49,337
I always wondered
why no one ever
really talks about

1515
01:31:49,471 --> 01:31:52,741
how much he had cost
all of those people.

1516
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:57,646
Way more than any amount
of fraud that he ever
uncovered or prevented.

1517
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:00,649
He was really
on the right road, he had
everything going for him

1518
01:32:00,783 --> 01:32:02,551
and to go this crazy,

1519
01:32:02,685 --> 01:32:05,487
to do the things that he did,
even I was surprised.

1520
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:07,856
And, look, not too much
surprises me.

1521
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:10,893
I've been on the street
a long time and I've seen
just about everything.

1522
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:14,062
I don't think
I've ever seen the extent
of what Barry has done.

1523
01:32:14,196 --> 01:32:17,299
I mean, this was a Madoff
type of thing. It turned out
to be his downfall.

1524
01:32:17,432 --> 01:32:23,538
I watched Barry do
an impassioned sermon that to
me was unbelievable oratory.

1525
01:32:23,672 --> 01:32:28,877
And he would then follow
that up after motivating
his entire parish,

1526
01:32:29,011 --> 01:32:31,880
and go out in the lobby
and accept a check
from somebody

1527
01:32:32,014 --> 01:32:36,018
that he knew he was
going to misappropriate
and spend improperly.

1528
01:32:36,151 --> 01:32:39,855
I know we're supposed
to forgive. As Christians,

1529
01:32:39,988 --> 01:32:41,857
we're supposed to forgive.

1530
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:45,327
Maybe I can say I forgive,
but I cannot forget.

1531
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:48,496
I cannot ever forget
what he has done.

1532
01:32:50,766 --> 01:32:53,235
He stole more than $3 million
from the church personally,

1533
01:32:53,368 --> 01:32:58,974
and multiple millions
of dollars from the people
in the church privately.

1534
01:32:59,107 --> 01:33:04,312
And, boy, he took money
in the millions from people,

1535
01:33:04,446 --> 01:33:05,781
but he took my reputation

1536
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:09,451
at... Which, you could always
get money back.

1537
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:10,919
The comeback that he made

1538
01:33:11,053 --> 01:33:14,589
and the impact
that he was truly making
was worthy.

1539
01:33:14,723 --> 01:33:17,492
But that story didn't end
the way it could have.

1540
01:33:17,626 --> 01:33:21,363
And I think when selfishness
and greed come in there,
it sent him back.

1541
01:33:21,496 --> 01:33:23,799
It was a very tragic ending.

1542
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:28,170
And tragic not just for Barry,
for the people that were hurt.

1543
01:33:28,303 --> 01:33:30,973
His whole life was an act.

1544
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:34,409
His whole life was an act.

1545
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:36,544
That's the bottom line.

1546
01:33:36,679 --> 01:33:39,581
MIKEY: Barry was
a master storyteller.

1547
01:33:39,715 --> 01:33:42,384
So even with Peanut,
for all I know

1548
01:33:42,517 --> 01:33:44,753
it was the same as
Jimmy Stewart's
Harvey the bunny.

1549
01:33:44,887 --> 01:33:48,123
LEROY: I don't think
the Peanut story
was all true.

1550
01:33:48,256 --> 01:33:49,758
I think there was a Peanut,

1551
01:33:49,892 --> 01:33:53,896
but I don't think it went down
like Barry said it went down.

1552
01:34:38,807 --> 01:34:43,411
This match right here
is me and your life.

1553
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:50,652
All the darkness in the world
can't overcome
the power of one light,

1554
01:34:50,786 --> 01:34:52,888
one person
who believes in you.

1555
01:34:54,589 --> 01:34:56,658
Don't ever forget that.

1556
01:34:59,127 --> 01:35:00,562
Ever.

1557
01:35:19,481 --> 01:35:25,053
* Flat out deception

1558
01:35:25,187 --> 01:35:30,192
* Conscious intentions

1559
01:35:30,325 --> 01:35:35,563
* And with every reinvention

1560
01:35:35,697 --> 01:35:41,236
* No dance with redemption

1561
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:46,674
* What kind of thievery
misleading, un-worshipping

1562
01:35:46,809 --> 01:35:52,247
* What a quick drop from grace
while the buzzers
were circling

1563
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:57,285
* It's a slippery slope

1564
01:35:57,419 --> 01:36:01,756
* Pinning hope against hope

1565
01:36:01,890 --> 01:36:07,295
* It's a slippery slope

1566
01:36:07,429 --> 01:36:14,236
* Pinning hope against hope

1567
01:36:14,369 --> 01:36:20,108
* And nine lives
of fatal flaw

1568
01:36:20,242 --> 01:36:24,913
* Destiny's last call

1569
01:36:25,047 --> 01:36:30,485
* Does any single act
of good one does

1570
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:35,690
* Ever trip the scales
of justice

1571
01:36:35,824 --> 01:36:42,064
* And is there
ever a light bulb
moment that's permanent

1572
01:36:42,197 --> 01:36:47,435
* Or does the moth fly
to the light just
to burn from it

1573
01:36:47,569 --> 01:36:53,241
* It's a slippery slope

1574
01:36:53,375 --> 01:36:57,179
* Slippery slope

1575
01:36:57,312 --> 01:37:02,484
* It's a slippery slope

1576
01:37:02,617 --> 01:37:09,124
* Pinning hope against hope

1577
01:37:09,257 --> 01:37:13,628
* Pulled out of the pack
and ripped from the headlines

1578
01:37:13,761 --> 01:37:17,665
* Deceitful free faller
no conscience no quarter

1579
01:37:17,799 --> 01:37:22,004
* Washed up and washed out
dead in the water

1580
01:37:22,137 --> 01:37:27,209
* Carried away by the floods
of the slaughter

1581
01:37:32,047 --> 01:37:35,951
* Slippery slope

1582
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:41,323
* Slippery slope

1583
01:37:41,456 --> 01:37:46,628
* It's a slippery slope

1584
01:37:46,761 --> 01:37:52,667
* Pinning hope against hope

1585
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:58,440
* It's a slippery slope

1586
01:37:58,573 --> 01:38:04,279
* Pinning hope against hope

1587
01:38:04,412 --> 01:38:10,318
* It's a skin on the true

1588
01:38:10,452 --> 01:38:15,590
* Stuffed with a lie

1589
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:21,429
* Flat out deception

1590
01:38:21,563 --> 01:38:26,568
* Conscious intentions

1591
01:38:26,701 --> 01:38:31,974
* And with every reinvention

1592
01:38:32,107 --> 01:38:38,113
* No dance with redemption *

1593
01:38:40,515 --> 01:38:42,184
* Yeah

1594
01:38:44,552 --> 01:38:46,188
* Uh-uh

1595
01:38:47,990 --> 01:38:50,792
* It's a matter of life
or a matter of death

1596
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:53,261
* When you take
your last breath
It's too late to regret

1597
01:38:53,395 --> 01:38:56,131
* All the pain you inflicted
now they got you restricted

1598
01:38:56,264 --> 01:38:58,833
* To four walls in time
'cos all you got is time

1599
01:38:58,967 --> 01:39:01,769
* To play it over and over
again in your mind

1600
01:39:01,903 --> 01:39:04,272
* All the souls and the lives
that you stole you was blind

1601
01:39:04,406 --> 01:39:07,442
* And all the wrongs
that you done did
that can't be undone kid

1602
01:39:07,575 --> 01:39:10,912
* Is there any room
in this place
for a little grace

1603
01:39:11,046 --> 01:39:13,748
* Everybody says that they're
never gonna change

1604
01:39:13,881 --> 01:39:16,918
* 'Cause the mind deranged
you lost, you insane

1605
01:39:17,052 --> 01:39:18,653
* You messed up
one too many times

1606
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:20,722
* Breaking laws
making lives
taking lives

1607
01:39:20,855 --> 01:39:24,792
* In the hope you can't cope
with the life that you made
for yourself

1608
01:39:24,926 --> 01:39:26,995
* They say
you had it coming

1609
01:39:27,129 --> 01:39:29,264
* What you do
for a second chance in life

1610
01:39:29,397 --> 01:39:31,833
* Would you roll the dice
or pay the price

1611
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:33,401
* For a shot at redemption

1612
01:39:33,535 --> 01:39:35,237
* Do you want
another chance to live

1613
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:37,672
* Do you want
another chance to live
* Yeah

1614
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:43,511
* It's never too late
It's never too late
No, no, no, no

1615
01:39:43,645 --> 01:39:45,347
* Redemption *
