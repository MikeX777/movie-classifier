1
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:03,868
My name is Vicky.
...Vicky...

2
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:10,839
I'm the son of Sudhirbhai;
the don of this city.

3
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,169
So, I do what I wish.

4
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:20,838
This is my friend,
Mahesh Goswami.

5
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,402
Nobody will raise their voice.
Get me?

6
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:26,502
The heir of the Goswami family.

7
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:29,435
And all these are my friends.

8
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,205
That girl is Mahesh's sister
Reema, my girlfriend.

9
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,102
Today is Mahesh's birthday.

10
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:35,033
Why aren't you singing?

11
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:39,802
Why should I sing?
-Speaking in English, eh?

12
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,833
What's he speaking?
- English!

13
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,369
What will he be speaking now?

14
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:56,304
He will bark like a dog.
- Come on, bark.

15
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:57,700
What are you doing?
Please leave him alone!

16
00:02:57,766 --> 00:03:01,402
Ladies deptt...- Leave him.. he
made a mistake.

17
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:09,034
Bark like a dog.

18
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,868
Keep barking!

19
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,034
That chap there... See?

20
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:08,172
No, spare me. I'll take money
from Daddy for a V.C.R.

21
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:12,937
There's no excitement in that.
And we want some excitement.

22
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,867
How about my V.C.R.?
- You'll get your birthday gift.

23
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,768
Now watch the fun.

24
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,869
I'm a poor working girl.
I've got to take a bus.

25
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,035
Could you give me
change for 100 Rs.? - Sure

26
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:54,901
Here you are.
-Thank you- It's all right

27
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,968
Let me go! Please!
Leave me..

28
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:07,769
lf we take that money without
beating you up how...

29
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,802
...will we enioy ourselves?..

30
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:19,805
Fun and excitement!...
We have the money, too.

31
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,234
Isn't this fun, friends?

32
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,636
Eat something first! The
newspaper isn't running away!

33
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:56,172
Let Amit come.- What affection!
If he keeps sleeping the whole...

34
00:05:56,233 --> 00:06:00,103
...day, will you keep reading the
newspaper?

35
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:03,667
It's better to be childless
than to have a son like him.

36
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,668
Amit has grown up, Shanti.

37
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:08,834
He knows the difference
between love and hatred.

38
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:12,903
Oh, leave it!
l am the one who has been...

39
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:15,668
...tolerating this useless fellow
for the last 15 years.

40
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,003
lf I weren't his step-mother,
l would've poisoned him by now.

41
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:21,767
Make him see sense.

42
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,569
He was born in a poor family.
He must live like the poor.

43
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:30,472
I'm not poor. I earn enough.
10000 Rupees a month.

44
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,534
Nor is Amit poor.

45
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,102
His grandpa has left him
a fortune of 2 lakh Rupees.

46
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:39,837
Go and wake up your brother,
Munni.- Very well.

47
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,700
Don't you dare move from there!

48
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:44,836
He will get the breakfast
only if he wakes up on time.

49
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:49,137
Or he gets no breakfast at all.
Okay?

50
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,068
Wake up at least now, son...
It's very late.

51
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:03,536
Come on, wake up. The tea's getting
cold. I've got to go to work.

52
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,169
Papa, you're here again.
- Don't be stubborn.

53
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,902
I've been asking for 2 minutes
from two hours.

54
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:12,602
But you aren't listening.- Wake
up. Don't be stubborn.

55
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,801
It's too late.
- Alright. Heat the tea.

56
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,534
You want hot tea?
I'll get it right now.

57
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,502
Here's some hot tea!

58
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,434
This is foul
- How's that?

59
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,735
You asked for hot tea
and I gave it to you.

60
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:32,800
Brush your teeth first.

61
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:36,436
Even tigers in the zoos
don't brush their teeth.

62
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,801
Really?
And what tiger are you?

63
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:40,802
I'm the tiger of the iungle
of your affection.

64
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:46,135
l brought something very
special for you last night.

65
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,768
What?
- First drink the tea...

66
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,501
...and I'll show you.
- Really?

67
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:53,101
Yes!
- So here I finish the tea!

68
00:07:57,433 --> 00:08:00,335
Which is why I ask you to wake
up early every morning.

69
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:04,334
Where are you going?
Show the gift to me first!

70
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,004
Okay! First close your eyes.
Open them only when I say.

71
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:17,367
Did you like it?

72
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,301
It's the most beautiful thing,
after you.

73
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,401
What affection between
father and son!

74
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,368
Where did this cycle come from?
- From the market.

75
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:34,636
And don't worry. It won't run
faster than your tongue.

76
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,302
Squander all your money
on him!

77
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:40,969
Have your ever thought that
your daughter is growing up?

78
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:44,802
Mother! Am I growing up?
- Shut up!

79
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:49,035
Oh God! What sin
had I committed...

80
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,837
...that I became a stepmother
to this ill-fated boy?

81
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:58,872
Oh God! I don't want to live
anymore. Take me away!

82
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:00,768
C'mon!
- Leave me alone, mom!

83
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:03,267
She'll always be the same.

84
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,269
You'll go to the college
on your new cycle today.

85
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:18,733
Hey! Walk straight.

86
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:24,733
Great!

87
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:49,533
Let's go to the class.

88
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:53,667
I'm going.

89
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,934
Isn't he the same guy
of last night?

90
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,467
Yes! He is the one.

91
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,334
The chap from last night.

92
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:11,334
A new bicycle!

93
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,435
Shall I give him his bicycle?
- Yes!

94
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,168
Shall I give him his bicycle?
- No!

95
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:32,401
No!

96
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,735
Shall I give him his bicycle?
-No...

97
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:39,202
Friends, shall I give his bicycle?
-No...

98
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,768
He's a new student.
Shall I give him his bicycle?

99
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,336
Shall I give his bicycle?
-No!

100
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:51,936
Friends! The little boy
will start crying.

101
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,300
Let me return his
bicycle to him.

102
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,367
Pick it up.

103
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,835
He's not picking it up.
Maybe he's angry.

104
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:10,168
But we had to teach him
a lesson.

105
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:56,135
My name is Vikram.
I'm the boss in this college.

106
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,502
My father is the
boss in this city.

107
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:03,270
The one who acts smart with me
gets destroyed like your cycle.

108
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,768
Remember this henceforth.

109
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,667
Sudhirbhai!
- Welcome, Mr.Goswami.

110
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:46,436
What brings you here?
- I wanted to talk to you.

111
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,002
The doctor anyway insists
on an evening walk.

112
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:52,269
l thought it was a excuse.
- Well?

113
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,167
Don't worry about him.
He is completely deaf.

114
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,633
The shipment has
Ieft yesterday.

115
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,969
The shares of the police and
politicians will go today.

116
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:06,702
As far as the M.P. Somnath
is concerned...

117
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:09,035
..we'll have to do
something about him.

118
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:16,470
Just assume that he is spent.
- What does that mean?

119
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:22,305
ln our parlance, it means
to bump off someone.

120
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,170
You've been my partner for many
days. And you aren't tough yet.

121
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:33,105
Why should you fear a dead man?
Think that I'm the agent of death

122
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,102
Tell me if there's anything else.
C'mon.

123
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,034
The other thing is that our...

124
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:40,934
Bless you, son.
- Son, tonight you are...

125
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,370
Not tonight, dad. Tonight we are
going to the disco.

126
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:45,500
So I'm calling up Reema.

127
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:50,037
My only son and your daughter
are getting on well.

128
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,468
l must leave now.

129
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:55,435
Reema, are we going to
the disco tonight?

130
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,267
Munni... where are you?

131
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:11,869
You've broken it, haven't you?
Nothing's safe with you!

132
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:16,637
Your father isn't so rich that you
can keep breaking things like this!

133
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:19,635
Are you listening?
You dimwit!

134
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:25,335
I'll teach you a lesson.
- Run!

135
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,101
Munni, hold the cycle.

136
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,268
Mother! Atleast listen to me.

137
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,834
Munni! Don't leave the cycle.

138
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:34,435
What's going on?

139
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:38,002
Where will you run?
- Papa, please protect me.

140
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,535
A new problem!
-Tell me what happened?

141
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:48,570
My head! Your son has broken
the new cycle worth Rs. 1200.

142
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,267
You've broken the cycle?
What happened?

143
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,168
Dad, now you don't
say anything.

144
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:53,634
Neither this is the world's
first broken cycle,...

145
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:56,635
...nor she is the world's
first mother who scolds.

146
00:16:56,866 --> 00:17:00,803
Why don't you saystepmother'?
- Saystepmother' !

147
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:05,435
Don't laugh.
Ask him how it broke.

148
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:09,200
How did the cycle break?

149
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:12,968
You've broken a bicylcle
worth 1250 bucks!

150
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,302
Tell me how did it break?

151
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:19,367
What happened?

152
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:26,302
Last night some people
were beating up someone.

153
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:27,400
And I saved him.

154
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:32,070
Now you tell, is this cycle more
precious than a old man's life?

155
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:36,770
No, son.
You did the right thing.

156
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:43,136
A cycle is not more precious
than anybody's life.

157
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:46,767
Go on, enioy yourself.

158
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,301
Oh sure!

159
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:49,567
Your father has a treasure.
He'll get you a new cycle.

160
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,168
Go on!
Sing, dance, enjoy yourself.

161
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:05,169
And today you can dance
with anyone you want.

162
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,835
This evening is dedicated
to those...

163
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:23,240
...who love...
-Love,...love and love!

164
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:25,267
Leave me alone...
Don't you wish to stay alive?

165
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,968
l do, but only in love.

166
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,369
Then you'd even like to die.
- Yes! That too for love.

167
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:32,200
l see!

168
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:40,436
l want to live in love.
and die in love

169
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,003
Those who fear death
can never fall in love

170
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,101
l want to live,
in love...

171
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,967
and die, in love

172
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:51,202
Those who fear death
can never fall in love

173
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,001
l'd happily accept
the noose...

174
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:55,901
and offer my heart
for a bullet

175
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:59,135
And this what love
is all about

176
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,834
l want to live
in love...

177
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,701
and die, in love

178
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:07,035
Those who fear death
can never fall in love

179
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:13,004
Love, love, love!

180
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,235
l found love in you,
the first time I saw you

181
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:13,169
How will I ever forget you,
my love?

182
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,301
l don't care for
what the world says

183
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:18,101
l heed my heart

184
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,968
I've given you my heart;
I'll give you my life too

185
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:29,568
l found love in you
the first time I saw you

186
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:32,669
How will I ever forget you,
my love?

187
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,201
l don't care for
what the world says

188
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:37,834
l heed my heart

189
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,737
I've given you my heart;
I'll give you my life too

190
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,168
I'll accept every sorrow;
I'll play with the storms...

191
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:49,070
This is what love
is all about

192
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,901
ln love, I want to live

193
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:53,600
ln love, I want to die

194
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,935
Those who fear death
can never love

195
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:02,837
Love, love, love

196
00:23:00,866 --> 00:23:02,434
Come, let's romance...

197
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,470
and dance like the waves
in the seas

198
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:09,733
Don't you go away...

199
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,434
don't leave me alone

200
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,670
How will I spend my time
without you

201
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,533
Come, let's romance

202
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,971
and dance like the
waves in the seas

203
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,434
Don't you go away...

204
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,901
don't leave me alone

205
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:34,135
How will I spend my time
without you

206
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:39,068
I will sing and
make you restless

207
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:43,203
This is what
Iove is all about

208
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:44,901
ln love, I will live

209
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:46,967
ln love, I will die

210
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:50,569
Those who fear death
can never fall in love

211
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,134
I will accept the noose

212
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,901
I will take the bullets
in my heart

213
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:58,836
This is love, love, love

214
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,668
ln love, we will live

215
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:02,668
ln love, we will die

216
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:06,103
Those who fear death
can never fall in love

217
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:20,137
Love, love, love...

218
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:01,870
Nobody dances with that girl
except me.

219
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,772
lf you are seen around her again,
I'll bash you up.

220
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:23,473
I'll give you such a punch that
you won't need bed tea tomorrow

221
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:42,904
Amit, you will be killed...
you'll surely get killed.

222
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:45,268
A murder is a game for Vicky.

223
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:50,771
Then why isn't he arrested?
- His father bribes the police.

224
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:52,935
And he gives lots
of money as donation.

225
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,503
He is an underworld don
of this city.

226
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:01,501
And Reema belongs to
the House of the Goswami's.

227
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:06,270
Her father Goswami and Vicky's
father are business partners.

228
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:12,439
Shut out all those fancy ideas
from your mind.

229
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,436
So that you don't even
think about Reema.

230
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:20,404
And there's no living and
dying in love with her.

231
00:27:20,466 --> 00:27:22,267
There's only death with her.

232
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,434
C'mon.

233
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,735
Hitler had inaugurated the Berlin
Olympics with just one statement.

234
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,903
That I declare the
Olympics open!

235
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:43,404
But if I say this, the organizers
of the fair will feel bad ...

236
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:44,800
...that Sudhirbhai has
avoided saying something.

237
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,537
lf a leader or minister was invited,
he'd lecture on for atleast an hour.

238
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,637
My dear brother and sisters!
I'm not a leader or minister.

239
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,670
I'm an ordinary man.
l won't say much.

240
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:07,373
I'll only say that we ought to
cut the ribbon and open the fair.

241
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:10,835
Open Sesame!

242
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,735
Think again. - What's there to
think about?

243
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,735
l can't bunk college
for the picnic.

244
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,501
What are you saying, sister?

245
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:32,102
She wants to study.
- I'm not coming!

246
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:51,502
Amit Verma, come to
my office immediately.

247
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:00,600
Sit down.

248
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:10,203
Whatever Ms Goswami has told
you...I'm completely innocent.

249
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,134
What are you talking?
-Yes, sir!

250
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:22,105
ls there some tension between you?
- Yes, sir! - No...! - No, sir..

251
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:25,102
There's nothing of the sort.
We don't even know each other.

252
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,767
You will know each other,
of course.

253
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,669
Because it takes 18 hours
to travel to get there...

254
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:32,402
...and 18 hours to return and
stay there for another day.

255
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:36,136
l don't understand, sir...- On
Delhi TV's quiz time program...

256
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:39,769
...the two of you will
represent our college.

257
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,401
l?
- Yes!

258
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:45,036
When you had represented your
school in such a program...

259
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:50,438
...l had seen you on TV. You
were quick with your answers.

260
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,435
You gave such appropriate answers
to those 4 questions...

261
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,469
...whose answers
even I didn't know.

262
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:03,135
But without daddy's permission...?
- I've taken his permission.

263
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,569
He wanted to buy an air ticket.

264
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:08,235
But I didn't think
that would be right.

265
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:12,137
The college team must go
like a college team.

266
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,804
So tomorrow, the two of you leave
for Delhi by the Rajdhani Express.

267
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:24,268
Now for the last question of
this quiz time program.

268
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:27,069
Who is the greatest lover
of the world?

269
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:30,834
Team A -Romeo...

270
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:32,767
Team B -Mainu...

271
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,533
Team A
-Farhad.

272
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:37,567
Team D
-Me!

273
00:30:46,633 --> 00:30:50,136
Reema left for Delhi last night.
- Don't tell me!

274
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,568
Why didn't you inform me
over phone?

275
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:54,836
How could I tell you?
We returned at 2 a.m.

276
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:57,768
l got to know when I woke up.
l didn't know either.

277
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:04,035
I'll go to Delhi then.
- Now what's the use?

278
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:07,470
The program must be over.
She must be preparing to return.

279
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:11,767
So who is your beloved?

280
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,304
She is yet to become my beloved.

281
00:31:18,266 --> 00:31:22,103
Your beloved must be
the greatest lover, isn't it?

282
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:28,101
Sit on my mobike,
I'll give you a lift.

283
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:32,535
Come...
-No, thanks...Come on!

284
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:36,467
It's a beautiful moonlit night.
C'mon! Sit..

285
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:40,135
Didn't I say no thank you?
- Who asked you?

286
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,768
I've spoken to her.

287
00:31:44,766 --> 00:31:45,600
Come and sit down.

288
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,568
Sit on my motorbike iust once.

289
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:09,967
How will I let you go
just like that?

290
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,267
Forgive me.

291
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:44,637
You wanted her to sit
on your bike, didn't you?

292
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,635
No!
- Why not?

293
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,668
This wish will surely
be fulfilled.

294
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,303
Not like this!
...like this.

295
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,368
Here's what you'll do.

296
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:02,269
Pick this motorbike from the gutters
of Jantar Mantar tomorrow.

297
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:04,134
And also take these skates.

298
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,868
l thought you were
just another boy.

299
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:18,038
So how do you find me now?
- I'll tell later.

300
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:22,103
l want to tell you something
before that.

301
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:22,566
What?

302
00:33:26,366 --> 00:33:28,234
Hang on...

303
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:33,037
Come and sit with me

304
00:33:35,966 --> 00:33:37,834
Listen...

305
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:43,337
to what my heart says

306
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:47,834
l love you

307
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200

l love you

309
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,101
You are my love

You are my love

314
00:34:08,266 --> 00:34:12,103
Hang on...
come and sit with me

315
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:16,803
Listen to what
my heart says

316
00:34:57,966 --> 00:35:05,006
Whenever I get the
opportunity to be with you...

317
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:15,007
l wish I could forever romance
with you throughout my life

318
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,835
The way you lovingly
talk to me...

319
00:35:23,433 --> 00:35:26,002
it sounds like a love-song

320
00:35:28,766 --> 00:35:31,268
When you walk with me...

321
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:36,705
it appears as if
the earth were dancing

322
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,034
l love you

323
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
l love you

324
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:46,267
l love you

325
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:48,834
You are my love

l love you

329
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:00,701
You are my love

330
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:05,103
Wait... come
and sit with me

331
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:10,738
Listen to what
my heart says

332
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:55,641
l have walked through your lane,
all days and nights...

333
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:02,337
l waited for that
window to open

334
00:37:02,566 --> 00:37:06,603
So I could have a glimpse

335
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,001
I will now live...

336
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:15,635
in your arms
every moment

337
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:20,901
Promise me your love...

338
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:27,369
You belong only to me

339
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:30,301

345
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:46,633
l love you

346
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,334
You are my love

347
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,867
Shall I throw a party?
- Go ahead!

348
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:27,902
Promise me that you'll come?
-Definitely!

349
00:38:27,966 --> 00:38:29,734
The party is fixed!
At my house.

350
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:36,767
Come here.

351
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:40,667
You guys iust loaf around!

352
00:38:40,733 --> 00:38:43,068
Cancel the swimming program,
we made for Sunday.

353
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:44,734
Why?

354
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,868
Reema is going to the party
with that fellow.

355
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:49,669
Hold this.
- Where is she?

356
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:50,934
She's in the canteen.
And don't grab my collar...

357
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,234
...deal with that guy!

358
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:57,567
So friends, the party
is fixed for Sunday.

359
00:38:59,966 --> 00:39:02,468
I'll break your legs if
l see you sitting close to her.

360
00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:06,201
She's my classmate.
I'll have to sit close to her.

361
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:07,767
I'll ...
- Now look, Vicky...

362
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:09,935
you can't behave like this
with my classmate.

363
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,638
I'll get your section changed
at any cost within 5 minutes...

364
00:39:15,699 --> 00:39:17,435
...l am not my father's son.

365
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:21,600
As if the college belonged
to his father!

366
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:26,737
So the party is fixed?
- Will you come even now?

367
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,902
On Sunday at 4 o'clock.

368
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:35,068
Don't you know that you must seek
permission before entering my cabin?

369
00:39:42,066 --> 00:39:44,501
What's the matter?
- I had come to ask you...

370
00:39:44,566 --> 00:39:47,035
...to change the section of
Amit Verma, who's in F.Y.B.A.

371
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:48,234
Why?

372
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:49,967
Because I say so.
- Mind your language.

373
00:40:03,466 --> 00:40:05,835
Dad, I'm talking from
the principal's office.

374
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,534
He's not doing
a small job for me.

375
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,870
Give him the phone...- My daddy
wants to talk to you.

376
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,101
I've heard a lot about you.
- That makes it easier.

377
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:22,969
No! It makes things difficult.

378
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:24,801
Because you haven't
heard about me.

379
00:40:24,866 --> 00:40:27,101
Go on.
- I know that you are...

380
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,234
...the undisputed king
of the underworld.

381
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:30,567
But I don't belong
to the underworld.

382
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:33,836
l also know that you can
get me killed any moment.

383
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,167
But what you don't know
is that...

384
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:39,036
...you can't make me change
the section of any student.

385
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:44,203
Get back to your studies...-
That wasn't a nice thing you did.

386
00:40:47,233 --> 00:40:48,867
You'll pay for this!
-Get out..

387
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,503
Johnny! -Yes, sir- Just find out
who is the chairman ...

388
00:41:03,566 --> 00:41:04,700
...of the Managing Committee
of National College.

389
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,534
Dad
-Yes, son?

390
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:14,503
My friends want a party to
celebrate my victory in quiz time.

391
00:41:14,566 --> 00:41:16,601
Sure. Have a party then.
- Before that...

392
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:19,835
...I'll have to get them insured.
- Why?

393
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,003
You know how Mom loves
chewing on people's brains.

394
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,434
Don't worry about her.

395
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,036
I'll take her to break
your uncle's marriage alliance.

396
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:33,571
To break his marriage?- He
wants to have a love marriage.

397
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:37,036
And you know how strongly
your mom is against love.

398
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:41,170
At what time is your party?
- At 4 p.m.

399
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,834
I'll take her out
at 12 o'clock.

400
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:48,034
Now what?
- Well...

401
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,633
Here you are.

402
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:15,734
Where are you going?

403
00:42:17,566 --> 00:42:18,566
No! Not now...
I've got to go somewhere.

404
00:42:20,866 --> 00:42:23,835
Which place in Bombay
is called 'somewhere'?

405
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,570
Where does Reema want to go?
=Somewhere'.

406
00:42:27,633 --> 00:42:29,935
And where is somewhere?
- Out there.

407
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,670
It's here... not there!

408
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:12,301
Before leaving, you must tell us
where you are going.

409
00:44:12,366 --> 00:44:13,600
Well...

410
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:16,435
Where does Reema want to go?
- There!

411
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:19,467
Not there... it's in there!

412
00:44:50,366 --> 00:44:52,301
You guys have ruined my clothes!
l hate you..

413
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,236
You take the ioke seriously?
- This is no joke!

414
00:46:08,033 --> 00:46:11,102
There's no point in waiting
anymore, Amit. Shall we go now?

415
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:32,337
Know something, Amit?
You can't trust these rich girls.

416
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,034
How was the party?
- Fine.

417
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,201
Looks like you had
a grand party.

418
00:46:53,266 --> 00:46:54,800
Yes! It was fine.

419
00:46:55,033 --> 00:46:56,267
Hasn't Mom come?

420
00:46:56,333 --> 00:47:00,170
I've left her at your uncle's house.
We can sleep peacefully for a night.

421
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,734
May I know who are
you waiting for?

422
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:11,600
lf you ask, I'll
have to tell you.

423
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:14,433
Then forget it.

424
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:18,268
l won't ask you today.
Come on.

425
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:24,733
Give it.

426
00:47:39,366 --> 00:47:42,302
Welcome, Mr.Malik. Why wouldn't
l come when you called me?

427
00:47:42,366 --> 00:47:44,634
Please sit down.
- Thank you.

428
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,535
Perhaps you know that
I'm the Chairman of ...

429
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:52,435
...the Managing Committee
of your college? -Yes.

430
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:59,139
You will also know that I run
many other colleges in town.

431
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:01,634
This isn't social work for me.
It's my business.

432
00:48:01,699 --> 00:48:07,105
And no businessman can take on
the government or Sudhirbhai.

433
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:11,236
So you will have to change
Amit Verma's section.-No, sorry!

434
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:16,905
You'll be sorry when your young
daughter or sister is abducted!

435
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,203
Before that happens, I resign
from your college.

436
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,001
Hey! Where are you following
her?

437
00:48:31,066 --> 00:48:33,501
l wasn't following her.
She's walking in front of me.

438
00:48:33,566 --> 00:48:36,402
Don't you know she's my sister?
- Did I say she's your mother?

439
00:48:36,466 --> 00:48:38,134
lnsolent rascal!

440
00:48:40,433 --> 00:48:42,301
Mahesh, you fool! Why did you
come in the middle?

441
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,001
No! I've got to go.- C'mon, let's
have an ice cream.

442
00:49:11,566 --> 00:49:13,301
You? Here?
Have you gone mad?

443
00:49:13,366 --> 00:49:16,335
Vikki, My brother and all his
friends are downstairs.

444
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,034
What if they see you here?
- They'll kill me, isn't it?

445
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:21,236
So be it.
- Go away.

446
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,835
Are you in your senses?
Go away!

447
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,402
lf you promise to go to the
movies with me tomorrow evening...

448
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:36,505
..I'll go away.
- Which movie?-Love story!

449
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:40,834
All right! Go away now.
I'll come tomorrow.

450
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,402
Promise!...
Tomorrow 6.30 pm at Regal.

451
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,067
Give my love to Vikram.

452
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:04,070
Whom were you talking to?
- I was practicing.

453
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:06,435
I've been knocking for so long!
Why didn't you open the door?

454
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,302
I'm not a servant
you can order around!

455
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:21,134
Go downstairs,
I've get ready and come.

456
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:40,167
Yes, he'll return from Delhi.

457
00:50:42,266 --> 00:50:44,935
Reema? Don't worry...
She'll be with me.

458
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,535
Are four hours enough
for you to get dressed?

459
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,034
What for?

460
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:56,534
Sudhirbhai has invited us
for dinner.

461
00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:59,235
You may go.
I've got to go somewhere else.

462
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,435
So call it off. What's the number?
I'll tell them.

463
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,969
There's no phone where
I'm going for dinner.

464
00:51:04,033 --> 00:51:07,503
Why must you go to a place where
there is not even a phone?

465
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:10,068
There's no need. Go and get
ready for the party.

466
00:51:11,866 --> 00:51:13,534
lncidentally, there are no
telephones even in a temple.

467
00:51:13,766 --> 00:51:17,002
But we go there with
all the devotion.

468
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:21,201
It's me...
I'm coming over, too.

469
00:51:21,266 --> 00:51:23,434
Right. We'll meet there.

470
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:26,934
You're still here.
Go and get dressed.

471
00:51:36,066 --> 00:51:38,201
Yes, I understand. Even you must
try to understand.

472
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:47,935
Reema, you've changed.

473
00:51:49,466 --> 00:51:51,000
You are not the Reema of old.

474
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,834
Go ahead and finalize
the business deal.

475
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,468
I'll be right back.

476
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,102
Listen...!
Where are you going?

477
00:52:11,133 --> 00:52:13,168
Don't touch me.
l don't like it.

478
00:52:24,966 --> 00:52:28,936
Come here. Get a drink for the
commissioner.

479
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,203
And remember that
he has it plain.

480
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:54,003
Reema, what's the matter?
Why are you standing aloof?

481
00:52:54,066 --> 00:52:59,938
l don't enioy such parties.
It's okay for your age group.

482
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,205
My dear girl's getting bored.
I'll scold Vicky right now.

483
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:07,201
He must take care of you.

484
00:53:07,266 --> 00:53:11,870
After all he has to
do it forever in his life.

485
00:53:11,933 --> 00:53:13,934
Why forever?
- That's because...

486
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,137
...you'll be marrying him in future.
- Marriage?

487
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:25,235
You don't understand, dear.
Vicky is my only son.

488
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:29,437
That he does not get what
he wants, is impossible.

489
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,502
What is it?- Does Ms Reema
Goswami live here?

490
00:55:38,566 --> 00:55:41,735
Give it to me. - There's
registered mail for her.

491
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,068
Reema madam!
There's a letter for you.

492
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,501
There's a registered
Ietter for Ms Reema.

493
00:55:48,566 --> 00:55:51,302
I'll sign it.- No, sir! Her
signature is necessary.

494
00:55:51,533 --> 00:55:55,570
You fool!
- Don't touch my beard.

495
00:55:55,633 --> 00:55:58,235
I'm her fiance!
Give it to me.

496
00:55:58,466 --> 00:56:01,936
l don't care about that. I want
her signature; call her soon.

497
00:56:03,633 --> 00:56:05,101
What happened? - There's a
regd. Ietter for Reema.

498
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:07,201
Call her here.
- One moment.

499
00:56:07,433 --> 00:56:09,468
Reema, there's a registered
Ietter for you.

500
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:13,470
Come 8 sign it-Call her quickly.
I've got to go elsewhere too.

501
00:56:16,433 --> 00:56:17,901
Who is it from?

502
00:56:20,766 --> 00:56:23,168
Come on.
- This fellow is a big fool.

503
00:56:23,233 --> 00:56:27,570
Dear Reema; whenever I call
Vicky or Mahesh pick up the ph_ne

504
00:56:27,633 --> 00:56:29,534
lf you want me to forget that
you ditched me at the movies...

505
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:30,834
come over to thèDisco Dandia'

506
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,501
I'll be waiting for you

507
00:56:32,566 --> 00:56:34,067
Madam Reema!

508
00:56:38,233 --> 00:56:39,968
Now what?
- She didn't return the slip.

509
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:44,904
Address her as Madam, okay?
- You can madam her!

510
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:49,101
Reema, Just get rid of this
aSS.

511
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,667
I will surely come.

512
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,802
l wanted the partnership of our
families to be put on record.

513
00:57:09,633 --> 00:57:11,468
So Mr.Goswami has named the
chain of our motels and hotels...

514
00:57:11,533 --> 00:57:14,702
as the R.V.M. Group of Hotels.

515
00:57:14,766 --> 00:57:18,035
This means Reema,
Vikram and Mahesh.

516
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:20,702
The three of you are equal partners
in the venture.

517
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:23,969
So to celebrate this,
we'll go out for dinner.

518
00:57:24,033 --> 00:57:27,035
So V and M will go
and fetch R.

519
00:57:45,466 --> 00:57:50,671
What happened?
- I have a splitting headache.

520
00:57:53,033 --> 00:57:55,435
lt isn't a fever, is it?
- No! It's just a headache.

521
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:00,638
Control your headache. Dad is the
Chief Guest at tonight's function.

522
00:58:00,699 --> 00:58:03,335
l won't enioy it without you.
- No Vicky!

523
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,603
lf I go with you, I won't ...
-What?

524
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:09,635
So what if I don't attend?
Go ahead, all of you.

525
00:58:09,699 --> 00:58:13,770
Come on, let's go.
She's such a big bore.

526
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:15,601
Go on.
I'll wait here at her bedside.

527
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:18,402
No Vicky! Will that
relieve me of my pain?

528
00:58:18,466 --> 00:58:20,067
Please go ahead.

529
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,770
lf there's any problem,
you'll find me downstairs.

530
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:32,736
Go away!- I'll be downstairs...
l won't go to the function- Go..

531
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:37,304
Mahesh, take him away.
- C'mon, she'll feel worse.

532
00:58:37,366 --> 00:58:38,467
Go on, Vicky.

533
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:52,367
Now look; only couples
can dance here.

534
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:56,436
Bachelors are not permitted.
No admission without girlfriend

535
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,869
How about the one whom somebody
has promised to come to?

536
00:58:58,933 --> 00:59:01,835
She had also promised
to come to your party.

537
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,370
Don't insist. She won't come
and you'll be insulted.

538
00:59:05,433 --> 00:59:10,604
Shall I tell you something?
These rich girls are not trustworthy.

539
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:12,601
Even I've tried to
score with them.

540
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:17,604
I'm not trying to score with her.
She will surely come.

541
00:59:17,666 --> 00:59:20,235
We'll begin the program.

542
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:24,337
lf she doesn't come before it ends,
I'll commit suicide.

543
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,902
What did you say?
- Suicide!

544
00:59:54,400 --> 01:00:00,539
Disco Dandiya...

545
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,402
She has promised to come

546
01:00:48,466 --> 01:00:50,968
She will certainly come

547
01:00:51,033 --> 01:00:56,972
She will come and
bring joy to the heart

548
01:00:58,966 --> 01:01:01,601
She has promised to come

549
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:04,435
So she will come

550
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:10,704
She will come and
bring joy to the heart

551
01:01:12,466 --> 01:01:14,768
We will be merry and sing...

552
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:18,169
and dance the
disco dandiya

553
01:01:18,233 --> 01:01:21,636
We will be merry and sing...

554
01:01:21,699 --> 01:01:24,836
and dance the
disco dandiya

555
01:01:39,699 --> 01:01:41,168
I've got the idea!

556
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:08,268
When she comes
into my arms...

557
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:11,335
she'll upset the
rhythm of my breathing

558
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,402
She'll look into my eyes...

559
01:02:14,466 --> 01:02:17,669
and send my heart afluttter

560
01:02:22,533 --> 01:02:24,768
She's like the
wand of flowers

561
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:27,702
When her stick
meets mine...

562
01:02:27,766 --> 01:02:33,638
my heart will sway
and I will be joyous

563
01:02:33,699 --> 01:02:36,436
She will make me dance
around her little finger...

564
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,201
I'll enioy that

565
01:02:38,266 --> 01:02:41,402
I will be merry
and sing...

566
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:44,669
I will dance
the disco dandiya

567
01:02:44,733 --> 01:02:48,369
We will be merry
and sing...

568
01:02:48,433 --> 01:02:51,269
we will dance
the disco dandiya

569
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,402
Why hasn't your
Iover arrived?

570
01:03:32,533 --> 01:03:34,835
l have faith
in your word

571
01:03:35,066 --> 01:03:38,035
You can't break your promise

572
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:41,303
You have been with me thus far

573
01:03:41,366 --> 01:03:44,569
You will not
desert me now

574
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,235
l have faith
in your word

575
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,536
You cannot break
your promise

576
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:02,769
You have been with me thus far

577
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,236
You will not desert me now

578
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,536
When I call out to you...

579
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,036
You will appear

580
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:16,303
My love is being
put to test today

581
01:04:16,366 --> 01:04:19,569
You will keep your word

582
01:04:38,699 --> 01:04:41,069
l had promised
to come...

583
01:04:41,133 --> 01:04:44,169
and here I am

584
01:04:44,233 --> 01:04:50,172
l have taken on the
world for you, my love

585
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,335
We will be merry
and sing...

586
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,536
We will dance
the disco dandiya

587
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,936
We will be merry
and sing...

588
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,203
we will dance
the disco dandiya

589
01:05:04,266 --> 01:05:07,402
We will be merry
and sing...

590
01:05:07,466 --> 01:05:10,936
and dance
the disco dandiya

591
01:05:51,266 --> 01:05:55,637
Your stick and mine meet

592
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,969
As if it produces
a spark...

593
01:06:00,033 --> 01:06:03,169
and our breath quickens

594
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:09,835
This has never
happened before...

595
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,936
there never was
a moment like this

596
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,605
We will kick up a fuss together,
come what may

597
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:23,337
Never again will someone dance
the disco dandiya like this

598
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,102
We will sing
and be merry...

599
01:06:26,166 --> 01:06:29,269
and dance
the disco dandiya

600
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:33,103
We will sing
and be merry

601
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:35,835
and dance
the disco dandiya

602
01:06:48,533 --> 01:06:52,637
Disco Dandiya!

603
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:30,404
I've read in stories that the cruel
world doesn't allow lovers to unite.

604
01:07:30,466 --> 01:07:33,402
But this world is truly very cruel.

605
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:37,837
Then what is to be done?
- Only love, love and love.

606
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,101
But for that, it is
necessary to meet.

607
01:07:41,166 --> 01:07:47,572
It's difficult to meet because of
your dad and Sudhirbhai's men.

608
01:07:51,533 --> 01:07:54,302
There's an idea.
But if you like it...

609
01:07:54,366 --> 01:08:00,105
you'll have to kiss me with
this lonely road as our witness.

610
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:05,103
And what if I don't like it?
- Then I'll kiss you.

611
01:08:08,166 --> 01:08:09,333
Stop laughing and tell me
about your idea.

612
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,168
These rich people wake up
very late in the morning.

613
01:08:14,233 --> 01:08:17,336
We'll meet on the pretext
of morning walks.

614
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:20,870
We both will come iogging
from opposite directions.

615
01:08:20,933 --> 01:08:24,436
That's it. And nobody will
even get to know.

616
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,335
Where were you?
- I was with Amit.

617
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,800
Don't you feel ashamed
to go out with him?

618
01:08:58,866 --> 01:09:01,935
lf I were ashamed,
why would I go with him?

619
01:09:08,199 --> 01:09:09,067
You shouldn't have done this.

620
01:09:11,766 --> 01:09:13,234
You shouldn't have raised hand
on my future wife.

621
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:16,770
What did you call me?
- My future wife.

622
01:09:16,833 --> 01:09:20,736
Stop dreaming about that.
I will never marry you.

623
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,835
What rubbish are you talking?!

624
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:33,002
I'm in love with Amit.
And that's for sure!

625
01:09:38,133 --> 01:09:39,434
What's up, Vicky?

626
01:09:43,066 --> 01:09:45,835
Dad, what the use of being
Sudhirbhai's son...

627
01:09:45,899 --> 01:09:52,640
if the girl I love, tells me...

628
01:09:52,699 --> 01:09:58,972
...that she loves a taxi-driver's
son and not me? I'll kill him.

629
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,370
Wait, my son!
Anger is precious wealth.

630
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:08,436
You must spend it
very carefully.

631
01:10:10,366 --> 01:10:13,669
lt'll be a waste to shoot
an ordinary taxi driver's son.

632
01:10:16,266 --> 01:10:19,035
Killing is our profession,
no doubt.

633
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,968
And we don't do it for free.

634
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:23,034
Give me the revolver.

635
01:10:24,199 --> 01:10:25,734
And here's what
you will do.

636
01:10:26,966 --> 01:10:30,936
Beat up that boy and he'll
come to his senses. Go on!

637
01:10:46,233 --> 01:10:48,034
Are you ioining me today?

638
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,269
l had told you that Reema is mine.
Do not get close to her!

639
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,902
Reema is mine.
Only mine!

640
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:51,703
Atleast think about your father.
You're always troubling him.

641
01:13:51,766 --> 01:13:55,503
Why're you always scolding
him, mom?- You keep quiet.

642
01:13:58,899 --> 01:14:02,570
Peace, lady! That's what
your parents had named you!

643
01:14:02,633 --> 01:14:06,036
What happened?
- Ask him.

644
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:09,703
l think he's...
- For God sake, keep quiet.

645
01:14:09,766 --> 01:14:13,136
Why must I care? Let him get
beaten up some more!

646
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:15,768
Who has beaten you up?
- Never mind.

647
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:20,404
How can I not mind?
Tell me, who has beaten you?

648
01:14:23,066 --> 01:14:24,767
Who was it? Tell me.

649
01:14:26,733 --> 01:14:29,368
No, Papa. This is my battle.

650
01:14:29,433 --> 01:14:33,703
When a family member is in trouble,
it becomes a family issue.

651
01:14:33,766 --> 01:14:38,837
Nothing is personal. You are
wounded but it hurts me, too.

652
01:14:38,899 --> 01:14:42,737
You are not an orphan
anybody can beat you up.

653
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,369
Tell me, who did this to you?

654
01:14:47,433 --> 01:14:48,567
I'll tell you when
my pain lessens.

655
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,868
Go and lie down,
I'll get the doctor.

656
01:14:51,933 --> 01:14:53,401
No! Not the doctor.

657
01:14:53,466 --> 01:14:55,467
There'll be a police case
and it will lead to problems.

658
01:15:00,366 --> 01:15:02,067
Then I'll apply medicine
on your wounds. Come on.

659
01:15:03,766 --> 01:15:04,900
Munni, bring in
all these things.

660
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,301
Sudhirbhai! Please come in!

661
01:15:22,966 --> 01:15:25,401
What can I do for you?

662
01:15:27,066 --> 01:15:28,667
l know that you
own two taxi-cabs.

663
01:15:30,566 --> 01:15:32,334
One, you drive yourself,
and the other you hire out.

664
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:37,972
Besides, you have a son, a
daughter, a wife and this house.

665
01:15:40,466 --> 01:15:44,736
Your other taxi can meet
with an accident in five minutes.

666
01:15:46,633 --> 01:15:48,301
This loss will be paid
by the insurance company.

667
01:15:50,766 --> 01:15:53,502
But what will you do if
your son loses his life?

668
01:15:55,699 --> 01:15:57,968
Even then it will
give you 25,OOO Rupees.

669
01:15:58,033 --> 01:16:02,971
But will that money bring
back your son's life?

670
01:16:05,433 --> 01:16:12,873
So tell him to keep away from
my future daughter-in-law.

671
01:16:15,233 --> 01:16:16,634
ln any case, Sudhirbhai never
goes to anybody's house.

672
01:16:18,733 --> 01:16:19,934
l would've called for you
if it was something else.

673
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,403
And I would've forcibly abducted
you, if you wouldn't come.

674
01:16:23,466 --> 01:16:28,938
But because it is concerned with
my son, I had to come here myself.

675
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,569
You've come to my house
for the first time.

676
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:37,505
You are my guest.
l heard whatever you have said.

677
01:16:37,566 --> 01:16:42,804
Because it is my duty
to respect a guest.

678
01:16:42,866 --> 01:16:46,035
You are smart to understand
what I was getting at.

679
01:17:22,366 --> 01:17:23,767
Haven't you gone
to sleep, son?

680
01:17:34,466 --> 01:17:35,200
What am I to do?

681
01:17:38,766 --> 01:17:40,501
l know Sudhirbhai has
blown up our taxi.

682
01:17:43,633 --> 01:17:46,502
Yes. And he has also
threatened me.

683
01:17:46,566 --> 01:17:49,969
That if my son does not
give up meeting Reema...

684
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:53,469
..he'll kill me.

685
01:17:53,533 --> 01:18:02,341
Sudhir is a powe_ul man and
he can reach anywhere.

686
01:18:05,566 --> 01:18:07,100
But if you want Reema
at the cost of my life...

687
01:18:07,166 --> 01:18:12,204
..l don't care for my life.

688
01:18:16,733 --> 01:18:20,303
She means a lot to me...
but not more than you.

689
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,802
I'll go far away from Reema.

690
01:18:30,666 --> 01:18:32,134
You love her very much,
don't you?

691
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,668
l loved your mother
very much too.

692
01:18:55,433 --> 01:18:59,670
So I can understand
how you feel.

693
01:20:13,133 --> 01:20:14,133
l didn't want Amit to go.

694
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:22,506
Greetings!
- We don't want to buy anything.

695
01:20:22,566 --> 01:20:25,435
Thank you!
-ls Amit at home?

696
01:20:27,699 --> 01:20:31,637
Aren't you Reema?
- Yes.

697
01:20:34,033 --> 01:20:34,500
Come on in, dear.

698
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:38,734
Have some tea.
- I won't serve any tea.

699
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:45,336
l came to ask why Amit
didn't come for a walk today.

700
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:50,369
Actually, we are
poor folks dear...

701
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,401
Amit found a good iob,
and he left immediately.

702
01:20:56,733 --> 01:20:58,134
He said he'll write a letter
as soon as he reaches there.

703
01:20:58,199 --> 01:20:59,701
But where has he gone?

704
01:21:01,733 --> 01:21:06,437
To Calcutta! Anything else?
- No.

705
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:10,103
Just let me know if
you receive a letter.

706
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:11,600
Sure, I will.

707
01:21:15,533 --> 01:21:16,433
You've made the right decision.

708
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:21,071
Just as I chose to resign,
rather than change your section.

709
01:21:25,233 --> 01:21:26,334
Reema's a very nice girl.

710
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:31,772
But your life is
more important.

711
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,372
And your final years' exams
are even more important.

712
01:21:37,433 --> 01:21:44,306
I've got your admission done.
Now start preparing for your exams.

713
01:21:44,966 --> 01:21:46,701
Come on.

714
01:22:19,966 --> 01:22:25,004
They don't let me live...

715
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:33,138
these memories of yours

716
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:43,406
O beloved, you have gone away

717
01:22:47,433 --> 01:22:57,075
Come back to me...

718
01:22:57,133 --> 01:23:03,239
or call me over to you

719
01:23:32,833 --> 01:23:34,834
There isn't a letter...

720
01:23:38,199 --> 01:23:41,836
there's no word from you

721
01:23:45,833 --> 01:23:50,504
Flowers are blossoming...

722
01:23:50,566 --> 01:23:55,504
and I wear a forlorn look

723
01:23:57,966 --> 01:24:02,904
Flowers are blossoming...

724
01:24:02,966 --> 01:24:08,137
and I wear a forlorn look

725
01:24:10,866 --> 01:24:20,242
l hope I don't die
thirsting for you

726
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:27,436
There isn't a letter...

727
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:32,202
nor any word from you

728
01:25:13,333 --> 01:25:17,704
How times have changed...

729
01:25:17,766 --> 01:25:22,804
what days are here

730
01:25:25,866 --> 01:25:30,704
Life is like
a shattered mirror

731
01:25:30,766 --> 01:25:35,270
l can see nothing

732
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:42,437
Come back to me...

733
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:47,738
Or call me over to you

734
01:25:50,766 --> 01:25:53,335
There isn't any letter...

735
01:25:58,066 --> 01:25:59,767
nor any word from you

736
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,370
Hardayal, I'll go in. Just lock
the door and throw the key inside.

737
01:26:09,433 --> 01:26:11,935
Why? - Reema will come to
ask for Amit.

738
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,068
l can't face her.
- Very well!

739
01:26:14,133 --> 01:26:17,836
And take away the taxi.
- All right!

740
01:26:38,766 --> 01:26:43,303
Seasons change and
come back again...

741
01:26:43,366 --> 01:26:48,738
but you haven't returned

742
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:53,168
Every day, every moment...

743
01:26:53,233 --> 01:27:00,173
l bear this excruciating pain

744
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:13,276
Without you, who will rescue me
from these pits of grief

745
01:27:16,266 --> 01:27:18,901
There isn't any letter...

746
01:27:21,899 --> 01:27:24,068
nor any word from you

747
01:27:41,699 --> 01:27:43,835
There isn't any letter...

748
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:53,301
nor any word from you

749
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:25,835
Get in from the window quickly.
- Okay!

750
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:57,903
When did you come?
- I came at 3 this morning...

751
01:28:57,966 --> 01:29:02,503
so I could meet you
before the door is locked.

752
01:29:09,166 --> 01:29:11,568
I've been coming here
for three days.

753
01:29:14,199 --> 01:29:17,736
l don't want anything else
except Amit's address.

754
01:29:20,233 --> 01:29:24,737
Please give me his address.

755
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,935
Shall I say something?

756
01:29:28,933 --> 01:29:30,668
You and Amit belong
to different worlds.

757
01:29:32,766 --> 01:29:36,236
You must live in your ivory tower.
That would be good for both of you.

758
01:29:40,233 --> 01:29:42,735
Ordinary people like us can't
take on people like Sudhirbhai.

759
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:46,236
lf it was iust the question of
my life, I wouldn't have bothered.

760
01:29:46,466 --> 01:29:49,502
But when Amit is concerned...

761
01:29:49,566 --> 01:29:53,202
...as his father, I have
to be careful.

762
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:01,235
l'd like to hear this from Amit.

763
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:08,437
I will not leave this place
until you make me meet him.

764
01:30:16,866 --> 01:30:19,168
Alright, keep sitting there.
Ask him when he comes.

765
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:22,601
l can't endanger his life.

766
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,768
One moment!

767
01:30:43,899 --> 01:30:44,834
You may go.
-Ok.

768
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:11,701
So, you do remember my face.

769
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,903
There was no other choice.
- What are you talking about?

770
01:31:29,133 --> 01:31:30,367
What right do you have
to this face?

771
01:31:34,933 --> 01:31:38,136
You are right. I shouldn't
have any right to this face.

772
01:31:42,699 --> 01:31:45,903
Because I'm a middle-class boy
for whom his degree, ...

773
01:31:45,966 --> 01:31:51,638
...a iob or a small business,
is more important than a girl.

774
01:31:55,233 --> 01:31:56,334
Don't lie!

775
01:32:08,933 --> 01:32:10,301
Just tell me,...

776
01:32:10,533 --> 01:32:13,535
how could you come here
without even informing me?

777
01:32:17,833 --> 01:32:22,337
Didn't you consider what l'd
go through, without you?

778
01:32:22,566 --> 01:32:25,602
l did think about you.

779
01:32:27,833 --> 01:32:31,036
But a dream always
Ioses out to reality.

780
01:32:33,833 --> 01:32:36,769
You must think that my dream
has lost to my reality.

781
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,572
To which of your realities?-
That my daddy is a mere cabbie.

782
01:32:44,633 --> 01:32:46,201
Sudhirbhai is an
underworld king.

783
01:32:46,266 --> 01:32:53,306
To the reality that I also love
my family very much.

784
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:58,669
I'm not ready to risk their lives
for the sake of my love.

785
01:33:01,466 --> 01:33:07,004
Tell me, what else could I do,
other than sacrificing my love?

786
01:33:07,066 --> 01:33:11,470
You mean we'll
never meet again?

787
01:33:24,633 --> 01:33:25,867
Why won't you meet?

788
01:33:27,033 --> 01:33:28,868
lf the earth and the sky
can meet at the horizon...

789
01:33:28,933 --> 01:33:32,970
even you both can meet too.

790
01:33:35,066 --> 01:33:36,167
But after a month.

791
01:33:36,233 --> 01:33:38,802
Because the exams will
get over after that.

792
01:33:38,866 --> 01:33:43,070
After his exams,
I'll get him a job in Assam.

793
01:33:45,066 --> 01:33:46,500
l know some people there
in the tea-gardens.

794
01:33:46,566 --> 01:33:48,668
Even Sudhirbhai won't
get to know of it.

795
01:34:33,966 --> 01:34:34,866
I'm all yours

796
01:34:34,933 --> 01:34:35,833
l belong to you

797
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:38,600
l ought to be yours

798
01:34:38,666 --> 01:34:40,000
l must belong to you

799
01:34:40,066 --> 01:34:43,402
Here and there...
- they must talk about us

800
01:34:43,466 --> 01:34:46,535
Anybody who sees us..
- must say...

801
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:52,505
We are in love, love, love...
we are in love

802
01:34:54,533 --> 01:35:00,805
We're in love, love, love...
we are in love

803
01:35:37,933 --> 01:35:43,371
With your arms in mine,
we will stroll on the path

804
01:35:43,433 --> 01:35:50,339
Let them watch, if they must...
why must we be shy?

805
01:35:55,500 --> 01:36:01,072
With your arms in mine,
we will stroll around

806
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:07,739
Let them watch, if they must...
why must we be shy?

807
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:11,770
When you walk with me...

808
01:36:11,833 --> 01:36:15,036
l like it very much

809
01:36:15,266 --> 01:36:21,038
Everywhere around...
- let them talk

810
01:36:21,266 --> 01:36:22,667
Anybody who sees us...
- Must say...

811
01:36:22,733 --> 01:36:27,804
We are in love, love, love...
we are in love

812
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:34,971
We are in love, love, love...
we are in love

813
01:37:02,333 --> 01:37:03,801
That isn't Hi in English...

814
01:37:03,866 --> 01:37:05,968
I'm actually groaning
in Hindi

815
01:37:07,566 --> 01:37:07,933
What for?

816
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,969
l had a dream last night;
l just can't forget it

817
01:37:12,199 --> 01:37:15,703
What was it about?
Tell me

818
01:37:18,433 --> 01:37:23,771
Enemies of our love
snatched you away...

819
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:31,240
you were screaming for help

820
01:37:32,699 --> 01:37:34,835
Be someone here
or not...

821
01:37:34,899 --> 01:37:38,403
I will say it
and so will you...

822
01:37:38,466 --> 01:37:42,002
Everywhere around...
- they've got to talk

823
01:37:42,233 --> 01:37:45,469
Everybody who sees us...
- Ought to say...

824
01:37:45,533 --> 01:37:50,437
We are in love, love, love...
we are in love

825
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:57,337
We are in love, love, love...
we are in love

826
01:38:46,533 --> 01:38:49,535
My daughter is obsessed with
that two-penny boy nowadays.

827
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,803
Children often do such things.
Even we used to be like that.

828
01:38:52,866 --> 01:38:54,601
Let's make one more drink.

829
01:38:56,733 --> 01:38:57,567
When I was 15...

830
01:38:57,633 --> 01:39:00,769
l fell in love with
a 24-year old maid.

831
01:39:00,833 --> 01:39:02,801
When father got to
know of this,...

832
01:39:02,866 --> 01:39:05,368
he got her married
to someone else.

833
01:39:05,433 --> 01:39:09,870
Now whenever I see that maid,
l get a very strange feeling.

834
01:39:12,333 --> 01:39:15,836
The country is affected
by epidemics and socialism.

835
01:39:16,066 --> 01:39:18,101
Reema is still young.

836
01:39:18,166 --> 01:39:21,269
She's infected by love;
she'll be all right.

837
01:39:21,333 --> 01:39:25,236
ln any case, she is
my responsibility now.

838
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:27,568
Because she is my future
daughter-in-law.

839
01:39:27,633 --> 01:39:33,472
Just fix the wedding date.
And drink peacefully.

840
01:39:36,633 --> 01:39:38,601
I've warned the boy's father.

841
01:39:38,666 --> 01:39:44,071
He won't even dare to
Iook at Reema again.

842
01:39:48,133 --> 01:39:50,702
So begin the
wedding preparations.

843
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:53,734
Come, dear.
Sit with me.

844
01:39:55,466 --> 01:39:59,670
l didn't like what you
just told daddy, uncle.

845
01:39:59,733 --> 01:40:02,235
It's okay, Mr.Goswami.

846
01:40:03,766 --> 01:40:06,268
Let my daughter-in-law
say what she wants to say.

847
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:07,801
Go on, dear.

848
01:40:08,033 --> 01:40:11,736
To begin with, I'm not going to
be your daughter-in-law.

849
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:16,468
No, dear! You have
wrong information.

850
01:40:16,533 --> 01:40:21,304
We were about to decide on a
date for your wedding with Vicky.

851
01:40:21,366 --> 01:40:26,003
Then don't decide it. Because l
won't be marrying Vicky.

852
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:28,502
Neither do I like him
nor his criminal background.

853
01:40:28,566 --> 01:40:33,203
It's difficult to decide which is
worse...Vicky? Or his background?

854
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:37,469
You can't even imagine
how bad his background is.

855
01:40:37,533 --> 01:40:40,702
l am his background.

856
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,201
lf only I wasn't so
affectionate to you...

857
01:40:46,266 --> 01:40:49,068
..you wouldn't be
so rude with me.

858
01:40:49,133 --> 01:40:53,804
lt is clear that the marriage
can't happen forcibly.

859
01:40:56,033 --> 01:40:59,202
Forget it, Mr.Goswami.
I'll find another girl for Vicky.

860
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:02,102
But..-Thank you, uncle..
-That is all right

861
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,036
But don't forget to go to
the J.J. Hospital tomorrow.

862
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:13,438
And ask the duty officer ...
What's that guy's name?

863
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:19,038
Oh yes, Amit. Find out how many
bones in his body are in tact.

864
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:22,269
He'll tell you the exact number.

865
01:41:22,333 --> 01:41:25,335
Because tomorrow all his
bones will be broken.

866
01:41:31,666 --> 01:41:33,134
Very well, Mr.Goswami.
I'll leave now.

867
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,168
Hi..That's not what I meant.
l was actually groaning.

868
01:41:49,233 --> 01:41:51,001
When did you arrive?
- I haven't arrived yet.

869
01:41:51,066 --> 01:41:53,668
l got down from the bus
to call you up.

870
01:41:53,733 --> 01:41:57,736
l felt like hearing your voice.
-l want to meet you immediately.

871
01:41:57,966 --> 01:42:01,135
Shall I come now?
- No! I'll come to meet you.

872
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:03,936
Where?
-Narsee Park..

873
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,169
Alright. I'll wait for you.
Bye..

874
01:42:27,166 --> 01:42:28,967
Come, dear, I'll give you a ride.
- No thank you, uncle.

875
01:42:29,033 --> 01:42:32,569
My best friend's daughter will go
in a taxi? This is not fair.

876
01:42:32,633 --> 01:42:36,937
Come, I'll drop you. ...
This is your car, too.

877
01:42:38,166 --> 01:42:39,133
Get in.
Driver, start the car.

878
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:48,367
Play the cassette, driver.

879
01:42:48,433 --> 01:42:50,968
Let's have her listen
to some classical music.

880
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:55,934
Amit, I want to meet
you immediately.

881
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,001
Shall I come over now?
- No! You don't come here.

882
01:42:58,066 --> 01:43:02,103
I'll come to meet you.
- Where?-Narsee Park

883
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:06,334
You must've understood by now.

884
01:43:06,399 --> 01:43:11,872
lf you love that boy,
you wouldn't want him to die.

885
01:43:11,933 --> 01:43:15,202
What are you talking about?
- That which is going to happen.

886
01:43:15,266 --> 01:43:16,000
What's going to happen?

887
01:43:16,066 --> 01:43:18,535
You mustn't put questions
to me, little girl.

888
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:24,205
I'm taking you to Narsee Park.
You want to go there, right?

889
01:45:13,933 --> 01:45:14,867
Look at that.

890
01:46:49,933 --> 01:46:51,301
Killing someone
is no big deal.

891
01:46:53,633 --> 01:46:57,003
l don't find it proper to kill
an ordinary taxi driver's son.

892
01:46:57,066 --> 01:47:00,269
But now his life
is in your hands.

893
01:47:02,133 --> 01:47:03,767
Don't fear, if you are in love.
It's a nice song.

894
01:47:03,833 --> 01:47:05,901
But it sounds nice
only in a film.

895
01:47:07,899 --> 01:47:11,236
Learn to fear for the one
you love.

896
01:47:25,033 --> 01:47:29,837
My sister has agreed
to marry Vicky.

897
01:47:29,899 --> 01:47:31,067
That's great!

898
01:47:36,766 --> 01:47:38,667
I'll give a party on
Reema's birthday.

899
01:47:38,733 --> 01:47:45,172
After which, our fathers
announce our engagement.

900
01:47:48,833 --> 01:47:54,038
Before that party, Reema will
come with me to invite that...

901
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:56,268
...taxidriver's son.
What wrong with it?

902
01:47:56,333 --> 01:47:58,635
He's her classmate;
he should be invited.

903
01:48:00,133 --> 01:48:01,934
Great! But what
about my V.C.R.?

904
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,604
When he comes to the party,
we'll insult him so much...

905
01:48:06,666 --> 01:48:10,236
...that he 8 his seven generation
will learn a lesson forever.

906
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:12,735
He has insulted me enough.

907
01:48:40,733 --> 01:48:44,069
Greetings! Whom do you
wish to meet? -Amit...

908
01:48:44,133 --> 01:48:46,602
How are you related to him?
- Not at all.

909
01:48:54,166 --> 01:48:57,903
What's the matter, Reema?
- Give him the card.

910
01:49:00,899 --> 01:49:03,636
Tomorrow is my birthday
and I've come to invite you.

911
01:49:08,533 --> 01:49:09,901
Tell him the truth.

912
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:15,668
Tomorrow I'm getting
engaged to Vicky.

913
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:36,904
lf you really have the guts,
you must surely come to the party.

914
01:49:36,966 --> 01:49:38,100
I will wait for you..

915
01:51:05,833 --> 01:51:08,869
What happened, son?
Who came in that car?

916
01:51:08,933 --> 01:51:13,837
What's this card about?

917
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:19,736
This is an invitation for
Reema and Vicky's engagement.

918
01:51:21,866 --> 01:51:22,666
They themselves came
to give me the card.

919
01:51:22,733 --> 01:51:26,937
That nasty chap said that
if you have the guts...

920
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,601
you will attend the party.

921
01:51:31,733 --> 01:51:34,702
Will you go to the party?
- Don't go there, brother.

922
01:51:34,766 --> 01:51:39,170
He's a very bad guy.
- Yes, son! Don't go there.

923
01:51:39,399 --> 01:51:43,470
After all, I am your mother.

924
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,768
No, mother. Don't worry.

925
01:51:46,833 --> 01:51:55,708
l want to go and see how much
the rich can insult a poor man.

926
01:51:55,766 --> 01:51:57,734
How much will they play
with my feelings.

927
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:59,768
He's right.

928
01:52:02,933 --> 01:52:04,401
A life of humiliation
is not worth living.

929
01:52:04,466 --> 01:52:08,503
Most people in this world
are decent.

930
01:52:08,566 --> 01:52:12,636
But these people live under
the fear of some hooligan.

931
01:52:12,699 --> 01:52:20,140
You mustn't ever do this.
Just listen to your conscience.

932
01:52:23,966 --> 01:52:26,668
Yes Papa. I'll do that.

933
01:52:50,033 --> 01:52:53,302
Good wishes for the birthday
and engagement.

934
01:52:56,033 --> 01:53:03,006
Let's see what present the
cabbie's son has brought.

935
01:53:03,066 --> 01:53:04,767
No!

936
01:53:12,833 --> 01:53:15,402
Be careful.
It's a special gift.

937
01:53:26,066 --> 01:53:27,434
lt appears to be worth
a million dollars.

938
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,034
Isn't it, friends?

939
01:53:29,266 --> 01:53:31,968
Make some deductions, buddy!
- How is that possible?

940
01:53:32,033 --> 01:53:34,969
It's a street Romeo's present.
It can't be cheap.

941
01:53:36,533 --> 01:53:39,802
Shahaiahan is dead but he left
a model of Taj Mahal for ...

942
01:53:39,866 --> 01:53:42,835
... such Romeos to present to
their unsuccessful love.

943
01:53:44,699 --> 01:53:50,572
Beggar! You should've thought
where you are going...

944
01:53:50,633 --> 01:53:52,434
...before you got the present.
You don't have any status.

945
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:56,904
But the girl who will be receiving
the gift, is Mr.Goswami's daughter.

946
01:53:56,966 --> 01:53:59,868
And Mr. Vikram Singh's fiancee.

947
01:54:01,766 --> 01:54:03,000
Here's what we'll do.

948
01:54:03,233 --> 01:54:06,836
We'll blow up his gift
like his love.

949
01:54:07,566 --> 01:54:10,302
Let's ask everybody...
Shall I destroy it?

950
01:54:15,566 --> 01:54:18,936
With your permission,
l destroy this special present!

951
01:55:19,366 --> 01:55:21,568
I'm crazy at heart...

952
01:55:21,633 --> 01:55:24,836
l do as I feel

953
01:55:26,766 --> 01:55:28,868
I'm crazy at heart

954
01:55:28,933 --> 01:55:31,802
l do as I feel

955
01:55:33,699 --> 01:55:35,301
I will not fear anyone
in the world

956
01:55:35,366 --> 01:55:39,670
I will proclaim today
that it's you I have...

957
01:55:39,733 --> 01:55:45,305
Loved you... my love

958
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:41,302
It's with destiny that
one finds love

959
01:56:41,366 --> 01:56:44,469
You lose your heart
only once

960
01:56:50,133 --> 01:56:52,401
You meet someone
only once...

961
01:56:52,466 --> 01:56:56,002
and fall in love

962
01:56:56,066 --> 01:56:59,769
Once you're in love...

963
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,370
nobody can ever stop you

964
01:57:04,466 --> 01:57:09,704
Love, love, love...

965
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:17,138
Love, love, love...

966
01:57:19,766 --> 01:57:26,105
I'm crazy at heart;
l heed the dictates of my heart

967
01:58:05,333 --> 01:58:07,702
Come to Hotel Blue Diamond
with your telescopic gun.

968
01:58:07,933 --> 01:58:10,168
You've got to bump off someone.

969
01:58:11,733 --> 01:58:14,502
Look into my eyes

970
01:58:14,566 --> 01:58:17,735
Embrace me

971
01:58:22,933 --> 01:58:25,068
Hide me in your arms

972
01:58:25,133 --> 01:58:28,603
Let them all be iealous

973
01:58:28,666 --> 01:58:35,339
Who will ever do what
we have done?

974
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:42,304
Love, love, love

975
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:50,439
Love, love, love

976
01:58:52,466 --> 01:58:55,068
I'm crazy at heart

977
01:58:55,133 --> 01:58:58,069
l heed my heart

978
01:59:47,133 --> 01:59:50,035
Goswami! See what
your daughter wants.

979
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:51,601
And what are you giving her?

980
01:59:53,466 --> 01:59:54,900
Are you a father or
just a businessman?

981
01:59:56,300 --> 01:59:57,367
She is your daughter!

982
01:59:57,433 --> 01:59:59,568
She's no wad of notes...

983
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:03,336
which you want to invest
in Sudhirbhai's black business!

984
02:00:05,033 --> 02:00:07,802
Does her happiness
mean nothing to you?

985
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:13,036
See what a beautiful couple
they make.

986
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:17,802
These young children
are challenging Sudhirbhai.

987
02:00:17,866 --> 02:00:21,202
And you, you only want to
save your skin?

988
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:24,102
Even if the world
is our enemy...

989
02:00:24,166 --> 02:00:27,869
we have a promise
to keep

990
02:00:35,233 --> 02:00:37,101
We're young

991
02:00:37,166 --> 02:00:39,101
Let's make a story
that's new

992
02:00:39,166 --> 02:00:45,572
Let the myopic world now see
what new things we do

993
02:00:47,466 --> 02:00:52,571
Love, love, love...

994
02:00:54,866 --> 02:00:59,971
Love, love, love...

995
02:01:41,433 --> 02:01:45,203
Don't be afraid, son.
Reema is all yours.

996
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:52,872
As her father, I give her away
to you today.

997
02:01:52,933 --> 02:01:56,803
Go far away from Sudhirbhai.

998
02:01:56,866 --> 02:01:59,168
Papa
-Yes, my child!

999
02:02:05,233 --> 02:02:08,269
Be happy. Go on!

1000
02:02:37,899 --> 02:02:41,169
I've brought her with
her father's consent.

1001
02:02:43,266 --> 02:02:48,270
This means Sudhirbhai will
first come here looking for you.

1002
02:02:48,333 --> 02:02:52,470
This also means that they
have only tonight.

1003
02:02:52,699 --> 02:02:57,104
Run away with her before dawn.

1004
02:02:57,166 --> 02:03:00,669
No, mother. I can't run away,
putting you all in trouble.

1005
02:03:02,199 --> 02:03:03,768
Don't worry about us.

1006
02:03:03,833 --> 02:03:07,436
I'll send Shanti and Munni
to Kanpur right now.

1007
02:03:07,666 --> 02:03:10,335
You go away.
- Right.

1008
02:03:14,266 --> 02:03:15,066
May you always be happy.

1009
02:03:17,033 --> 02:03:21,070
l had secretly made some clothes
for Amit's bride, dear.

1010
02:03:21,133 --> 02:03:22,834
Take them along.

1011
02:03:29,233 --> 02:03:31,201
Bless you, dear.

1012
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:36,837
Every love story normally ends
with the death of the lovers.

1013
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:40,267
You both will write a new story.

1014
02:03:42,266 --> 02:03:45,235
Wake up a priest
and get married.

1015
02:03:45,300 --> 02:03:48,036
Go on.

1016
02:04:00,899 --> 02:04:02,835
Where is that rebel
of your daughter?

1017
02:04:05,399 --> 02:04:08,836
Well...
l just went to her room.

1018
02:04:10,199 --> 02:04:11,668
l found a letter in which
she had written ...

1019
02:04:13,266 --> 02:04:15,234
Daddy, please forgive me.

1020
02:04:15,300 --> 02:04:19,303
l can't marry Vicky
because I love Amit.

1021
02:04:19,366 --> 02:04:23,670
So, I'm going far away
with Amit.

1022
02:04:23,733 --> 02:04:27,803
Goswami, you are my friend
as well as my partner.

1023
02:04:29,366 --> 02:04:32,302
But I regret, if your daughter
does not marry my son...

1024
02:04:32,366 --> 02:04:36,002
...then give her up for dead.

1025
02:04:36,066 --> 02:04:38,368
You won't do that.

1026
02:04:40,033 --> 02:04:41,601
Daddy,
what the hell is all this?!

1027
02:04:43,366 --> 02:04:47,603
It's nothing, son. Reema has run
away with that guy.

1028
02:04:49,766 --> 02:04:51,634
No...
-Come to your senses.

1029
02:04:53,966 --> 02:04:55,033
How will I come to my senses?

1030
02:04:55,933 --> 02:04:58,335
lt is all because
of this old goat!

1031
02:04:58,566 --> 02:04:59,934
Mind your language!

1032
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,268
lf your daughter does
not marry me,...

1033
02:05:02,333 --> 02:05:08,138
I'll destroy your family
from this face of this earth!

1034
02:05:08,199 --> 02:05:09,734
Have patience, my son.

1035
02:05:11,566 --> 02:05:15,169
To begin with, bring the
cabbie's family to Store # 14.

1036
02:05:16,533 --> 02:05:19,335
Then thrash all his friends
and make them reveal...

1037
02:05:19,566 --> 02:05:23,169
...where has he gone with
my would be daughter-in-law.

1038
02:05:25,733 --> 02:05:31,772
Search for them in every nook
and corner of the city.

1039
02:05:31,833 --> 02:05:34,835
At every railway station,
taxi stand and bus stop.

1040
02:05:34,899 --> 02:05:38,303
So that they don't
get out of the city.

1041
02:05:39,033 --> 02:05:40,334
Once they are caught,...

1042
02:05:40,566 --> 02:05:43,335
..bring my would-be
daughter-in-law to me.

1043
02:05:45,033 --> 02:05:47,168
And have the guy bumped off.

1044
02:05:55,866 --> 02:05:58,235
Verma, where is your son?

1045
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,969
Where is he?- I don't know.
- You'll tell us right now.

1046
02:06:03,699 --> 02:06:04,934
Ask him!

1047
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,836
Bastards! I use these hands
to change the gears in my cab.

1048
02:06:37,899 --> 02:06:39,968
I'll change yours now!

1049
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:50,003
You too want to know
my son's address?

1050
02:06:59,399 --> 02:07:00,134
C'mon!

1051
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:14,602
So Ms Goswami has also
come with you! Sit down.

1052
02:07:14,666 --> 02:07:18,503
She's no longer Miss Goswami.
She is Mrs. Amit Verma now.

1053
02:07:19,666 --> 02:07:20,900
l like brave children.

1054
02:07:20,966 --> 02:07:25,904
But I'll give you some bad news
alongwith the praise.

1055
02:07:25,966 --> 02:07:31,204
There was news on T.V.
that the Vice President of the...

1056
02:07:31,433 --> 02:07:34,636
...Taxi Driver's Union was shot
by some unknown men last night.

1057
02:07:34,699 --> 02:07:40,605
He is in St. George Hospital
and is out of danger.

1058
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:44,935
We will go there, sir.
C'mon, Reema.

1059
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:49,704
l think you must leave her here.
And go and see your father quietly.

1060
02:07:50,933 --> 02:07:53,468
No, Sir, I will go with him.
- No, Reema. He's right.

1061
02:07:53,866 --> 02:07:57,469
Please look after her, sir.

1062
02:07:57,533 --> 02:08:03,071
Don't worry, son.
-Take care of yourself, Amit

1063
02:08:18,533 --> 02:08:22,103
Reema, you are iust like
my grand-daughter Sangeeta.

1064
02:08:22,333 --> 02:08:24,034
You don't need to worry.

1065
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:27,036
Nobody can harm you
till such time as I live.

1066
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:29,135
l'd lay down my life...

1067
02:08:35,633 --> 02:08:36,967
Bloody cheat!

1068
02:08:43,433 --> 02:08:44,400
You've deceived me!

1069
02:08:44,466 --> 02:08:46,467
You have betrayed me!

1070
02:08:50,666 --> 02:08:51,867
No!
- Hold it!

1071
02:09:07,733 --> 02:09:10,802
Tell Amit that if he wants to
cure himself of the obsession...

1072
02:09:10,866 --> 02:09:14,302
..he can find me with Reema
at the Disney Fair.

1073
02:09:15,699 --> 02:09:17,501
Tell him to come there.

1074
02:09:26,066 --> 02:09:31,871
Do you love that
cabbie's son Amit?

1075
02:09:31,933 --> 02:09:36,737
Yes! I love him
and I hate you.

1076
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:41,905
l didn't ask you what
you feel about me.

1077
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:49,604
Did I ask that of Ms Goswami?
Tell me - No...

1078
02:09:51,933 --> 02:09:52,933
Have you heard?

1079
02:09:54,899 --> 02:09:57,769
You only hate me now.

1080
02:09:59,966 --> 02:10:03,469
ln a short while,
you'll be afraid of me.

1081
02:10:03,533 --> 02:10:08,004
You'll be very scared.

1082
02:10:08,933 --> 02:10:14,538
You'll say, No Vicky...
For God's sake, don't do this

1083
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:19,338
I'll say, Whatever I do,
l do it for my own sake

1084
02:10:19,399 --> 02:10:21,001
Not for God's sake

1085
02:10:21,233 --> 02:10:23,568
l haven't been
introduced to God

1086
02:10:23,633 --> 02:10:27,970
Do I know God, guys?
-No,No...

1087
02:10:28,466 --> 02:10:29,466
Heard that?

1088
02:10:30,699 --> 02:10:34,970
You'll have to change
those lines...

1089
02:10:35,899 --> 02:10:40,738
You'll say,
Vicky have mercy on me

1090
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:44,403
Mercy, Vicky!

1091
02:10:44,699 --> 02:10:47,302
And I'll say, I can't
have mercy on you; I can't

1092
02:10:47,366 --> 02:10:50,936
How can I have mercy,
when I can only love?

1093
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,503
l won't have any mercy on you

1094
02:10:56,966 --> 02:11:00,302
It's a habit, you see.

1095
02:11:00,366 --> 02:11:03,001
Once I come to like something...

1096
02:11:03,233 --> 02:11:05,234
l either acquire it...

1097
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:10,638
..or finish it in a way that
it can't belong to anyone else.

1098
02:11:10,699 --> 02:11:19,008
So I'm going to rape you now.

1099
02:11:19,233 --> 02:11:23,937
No!... No!

1100
02:11:38,899 --> 02:11:40,835
Love, Love...
-Please leave me..

1101
02:11:43,566 --> 02:11:46,468
Hold it, Vicky!
l won't let you do that!

1102
02:11:49,199 --> 02:11:51,602
Leave her alone!
Don't you dare touch her!

1103
02:11:51,666 --> 02:11:56,504
Goswami Jr... nobody can
save her from me today.

1104
02:11:56,899 --> 02:12:01,170
No..Bash him up.
-Vikki, Let her go!

1105
02:12:01,233 --> 02:12:06,137
l won't spare you!
- Vicky, let Mahesh go!

1106
02:12:07,199 --> 02:12:10,670
Leave him alone?

1107
02:12:11,399 --> 02:12:16,905
He has affection for a sister
who hates me!

1108
02:12:17,133 --> 02:12:21,170
There's going to be a big drama
now! Great fun!

1109
02:12:24,266 --> 02:12:25,300
Just bring that here.

1110
02:12:28,333 --> 02:12:32,770
This is blood-red colour
which my dog really hates.

1111
02:12:32,833 --> 02:12:37,404
He attacks anybody who wears
this colour on his face.

1112
02:12:37,466 --> 02:12:40,368
Now he will attack you too.

1113
02:12:43,399 --> 02:12:45,802
The real prey is Amit.

1114
02:12:45,866 --> 02:12:48,268
Mahesh is iust an example.

1115
02:12:50,866 --> 02:12:53,702
Now look what I'll
do to your sister.

1116
02:12:53,766 --> 02:12:57,336
No Vicky!
l won't let you do this.

1117
02:12:57,399 --> 02:12:59,602
Try to act smart with me,
and the dog will attack you.

1118
02:13:02,733 --> 02:13:04,101
You hate me?

1119
02:13:50,066 --> 02:13:51,066
Where's the girl?

1120
02:13:52,766 --> 02:13:55,135
She ran away.
- Ran away? Come on.

1121
02:13:57,766 --> 02:13:59,534
Sir, what happened?

1122
02:14:01,699 --> 02:14:05,203
Life for decent people
is tough, my boy.

1123
02:14:05,266 --> 02:14:07,267
But who has beaten you?

1124
02:14:07,333 --> 02:14:11,003
Don't worry about me.
Save Reema!

1125
02:14:11,066 --> 02:14:15,503
What's happened to her?
- Vicky has taken her away!

1126
02:14:15,566 --> 02:14:19,569
Where to?
- Disney Fair.

1127
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,602
Fan out everywhere!
Look for them! Go on!

1128
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,267
Go up there.

1129
02:16:01,866 --> 02:16:03,133
Did you find Reema?

1130
02:16:03,199 --> 02:16:05,201
Go and look for her!

1131
02:16:52,133 --> 02:16:56,570
Amit is somewhere around!
Look for him.

1132
02:18:14,066 --> 02:18:15,500
Take off your clothes!

1133
02:18:15,733 --> 02:18:18,001
l want revenge for the death
of my friends!

1134
02:18:18,066 --> 02:18:23,905
Take off your clothes! Strip!
-Leave me alone.

1135
02:20:10,933 --> 02:20:12,868
You hate me!
...don't you?

1136
02:22:03,866 --> 02:22:07,202
Say that again!
And I'll give you a reply.

1137
02:22:13,866 --> 02:22:16,201
You thought you'd get my Reema...

1138
02:22:17,866 --> 02:22:19,801
that you could make her
the object of your lust...!

1139
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:23,169
and that I would
Iet you do that!

1140
02:22:25,866 --> 02:22:27,801
Reema is my love.

1141
02:22:28,866 --> 02:22:30,801
She's my life!

1142
02:22:59,133 --> 02:23:01,235
Look out, Amit!

1143
02:23:28,799 --> 02:23:31,869
You boy there... you haven't done
the right thing!

1144
02:23:32,133 --> 02:23:34,535
l didn't want to kill you.

1145
02:23:34,666 --> 02:23:36,834
And that is exactly what
l always told Vicky too!

1146
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:40,002
That you must combat only those
who are your equals!

1147
02:23:40,466 --> 02:23:44,570
A mere taxi driver's son
can't compete with us!

1148
02:23:44,799 --> 02:23:47,936
This is the corpse
of my only son.

1149
02:23:49,466 --> 02:23:57,674
And it has made you my equal.
Come out, you bastard! come out.

1150
02:23:58,399 --> 02:24:04,439
Else, this girI will be killed
before you!

1151
02:24:16,733 --> 02:24:18,668
Amit...
Hold it... Freeze there!

1152
02:24:18,799 --> 02:24:21,869
Look how I make a sieve
out of your lover's body!

1153
02:24:30,733 --> 02:24:31,733
No...!

1154
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:11,004
When I had myself moved away
for my daughter's happiness...

1155
02:25:11,066 --> 02:25:12,934
...Sudhirbhai was nothing.

1156
02:25:14,666 --> 02:25:16,401
Go, my child.
Be you be happy.

1157
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,469
But always remember one thing.

1158
02:25:20,333 --> 02:25:21,967
This life has only one aim.

1159
02:25:22,666 --> 02:25:31,107
Love, love... - Excuse me, sir
-Love...
