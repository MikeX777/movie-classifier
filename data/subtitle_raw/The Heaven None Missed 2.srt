1
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:22,916
I'm still on the way, hon.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,333
Sorry, the meeting
took an hour longer,

3
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:29,000
George has rearranged our
site visits in Hungary.

4
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,625
You're sure there won't be any
more delays, hon?

5
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,708
I've made sure my schedule is packed
for the five days in Budapest

6
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,125
so we can spend time with you after.

7
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,458
<i>Don't worry, I'll be there as planned.</i>

8
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,833
Could you please take my medicines
and put them outside?

9
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,458
-And my suitcase, too, please.
-Okay.

10
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:46,125
-Please be careful, hon.
<i>-Okay, hon. All right.</i>

11
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,833
Peace be with you, hon.
Where are you now?

12
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,083
At the hospital.

13
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,166
Hospital?

14
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,500
What's wrong, hon? Who's sick?

15
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,458
I'm okay! It's just...

16
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,416
There was an accident on the way.

17
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,041
-The accident...
-A woman?

18
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,375
Yes.

19
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,000
<i>But, don't worry,</i>
<i>I've already called her family.</i>

20
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,416
They're on the way here now
so, I can leave.

21
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,833
No, don't, hon. Don't.

22
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,708
<i>Just wait till</i>
<i>her family gets there.</i>

23
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,416
Nadia and I can take a cab.

24
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,875
<i>We will meet you at the airport.</i>
<i>Peace be with you.</i>

25
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,000
Mr. Pras?

26
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,041
Doc, how are you?

27
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,833
It's happening again, is it?

28
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,416
But this...
How is she?

29
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,000
Don't worry.

30
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,208
She's all right.

31
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,708
She's not pregnant, is she, Doc?

32
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,750
Don't worry, Mr. Pras.

33
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,625
She would like to meet you.

34
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,833
No, it's okay. I actually have to go now.

35
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,416
Don't worry, her condition is stable.
Please come in.

36
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,583
Thank you so much, sir.

37
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,875
I'm not sure what else to say.

38
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,875
You're welcome, miss.

39
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,750
Is that all you wanted to say, miss?

40
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,083
No personal issues
or something about your past...

41
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:10,000
No, sir. Again, thank you so much.

42
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,208
Safina!

43
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,666
Oh, my God!

44
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,000
What happened to you?

45
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,166
What happened?

46
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,500
I'm okay.

47
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,958
Mom, Dad.

48
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,458
This is Mr. Prasetya.

49
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:39,208
So this is the gentleman you wanted
to introduce to me this afternoon?

50
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,375
No, ma'am.
No, sir. No.

51
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,875
No, Mom.

52
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:46,750
He helped me after the accident.

53
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,333
Thank you, sir.

54
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,875
Your kindness will never be forgotten.

55
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,708
-Thank you.
-You're welcome, sir.

56
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,583
-She just went to the check-in counter.
-Arini!

57
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,416
Uncle Amran!
Uncle Hartono!

58
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,375
What are you two doing here?

59
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,333
Why the large entourage?

60
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,875
Ask Mr. Romance here.

61
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,166
Ask him why he insisted on
coming here.

62
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,583
Who is the woman now, Amran?

63
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,875
A woman from our neighboring country.

64
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,083
Going so far?

65
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:19,083
No, she's the Malaysian student
taking her masters at UGM.

66
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,291
And currently
Mrs. Prasetya's manager.

67
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,291
-Sheila?
-Stop it, stop it.

68
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,500
Come, let's go there.

69
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,125
You would still like to do
the interview, right?

70
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,916
So, it's Sheila.

71
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,458
Why didn't you tell me?

72
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,750
-You already knew, didn't you?
-Yup!

73
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,333
-Where's Pras?
-He is at the hospital.

74
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,458
He helped someone who was in an accident.

75
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:37,583
-A woman?
-A woman?

76
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, dear!

77
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,083
Why are you so calm?

78
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,625
What if it happens again?

79
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,375
Don't be negative.

80
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,875
So what if it's a woman?

81
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,375
Men can remarry up to four times.

82
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,375
Is marriage the only thing
you can think of?

83
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,333
Let it go.

84
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,666
Please watch Nadia for a while.

85
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,708
-Let's sit here, sir.
-Okay.

86
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,916
What are we doing here?
Let's just go home.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,041
What? No.
I want to look for Sheila first.

88
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,791
Okay. Sorry, I've got
the boarding passes now.

89
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:07,958
We need to board now!

90
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,666
Mr. Prabu, sorry,
I have to go now.

91
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,458
It's okay, ma'am, If I need
anything else I'll email you, okay?

92
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,791
Okay, sure.

93
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,125
Sheila.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,250
Remember me?

95
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,041
Someone who...

96
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,875
This is embarrassing.

97
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,416
Take care.

98
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,708
-I have something for you.
-What is this?

99
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,416
That can make your trip more comfortable.

100
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,750
You mean sleeping pills?

101
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,291
Diplomatic relations between
Indonesia and Malaysia are heating up

102
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,375
because of a pillow.

103
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,458
Thank you, Amran.

104
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,291
You are welcome, don't throw it away.

105
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,708
Okay. Bye.

106
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,416
Bye, guys.

107
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,583
Please call me when you land,
and call Sita right after, okay?

108
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,666
-Say hello to Sita for me.
-Will do.

109
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,750
Okay. Come on, sweetheart.

110
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,083
-Mom.
-Yes, princess?

111
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,833
Where's Daddy?

112
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,375
Daddy?

113
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,958
Panji Rindu Alam?

114
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:24,666
Okay.

115
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:36,875
Come on, sweetheart.

116
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,500
I don't want to get on the plane
before I see Daddy.

117
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,625
Why did you say that, darling?

118
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:47,625
Don't you want to see Daddy
before we get on the plane, Mom?

119
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,458
Nadia, we are late.
We have to go now. Okay?

120
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:02,083
Although Daddy isn't here,
he's thinking of us.

121
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,750
We have to go now, okay?
Come on.

122
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:08,833
Don't worry, okay, princess?
Look, Mom's brave.

123
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:18,458
Damn. It's these officials who create
traffic jams.

124
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,291
Look, it's Pras!

125
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,083
Go after him.

126
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,166
Pras!

127
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,250
-Come on.
-No. You guys go ahead.

128
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,583
-Just a moment.
-I'll go home first, okay?

129
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,750
Sheila.

130
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:44,207
What are you doing?

131
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,958
You are so loud. Be quiet.

132
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,291
-Sheila, Hartono.
-Stop repeating Sheila, Sheila.

133
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,208
-Should we go home now?
-Yes.

134
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,291
Daddy!

135
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:07,791
Daddy!

136
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:08,916
Nadia.

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,166
-Nadia.
-Sheila.

138
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,416
Sheila.

139
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,125
-Stop calling her!
-Sheila.

140
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,583
-Daddy.
-Princess.

141
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,333
I'm so sorry I'm late.

142
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,250
You're not late, Daddy,
you're right on time.

143
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,791
The woman I helped, she's the daughter
of the Jogja Police Chief.

144
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,708
He prepared an escort for me.

145
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,750
How is she now?

146
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,041
Thank God, all is well.

147
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,375
Thank God.

148
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,250
So glad I got to see you before I leave.

149
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,625
I would've felt so guilty otherwise.

150
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,041
Mom, you lied to me.

151
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:59,083
You told me you're not scared, Mom.

152
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,208
It's time, ma'am.

153
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,416
Just a moment.

154
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,166
Please take care of yourself.

155
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,000
-Don't make yourself too tired.
-Okay.

156
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,166
Don't forget to take your vitamins.

157
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,583
Will do.

158
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:17,541
Hope this trip goes exactly as you wish.

159
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,208
-Amen.
-Amen.

160
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,166
-Take care, okay?
-I will.

161
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,541
We better go now. Peace be with you.

162
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,375
Peace be with you.
Bye, honey.

163
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,666
-Bye.
-Bye.

164
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,875
Pras, is the policeman's daughter pretty?

165
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,541
-Forget it.
-What?

166
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:54,375
You want to date her, too?
I thought you wanted to be with Sheila?

167
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,500
Four, Har. Four.

168
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,208
It's simple. Men can have four.

169
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,208
Here's your four.

170
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,250
You can't even convince one,
and you want four? You talk too much.

171
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,333
Ouch.

172
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,541
Sheila!

173
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,625
Oh, no.

174
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,041
Stop!

175
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,041
You really are talented.

176
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,125
What do you think?

177
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,166
Thank you.

178
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,833
Peter, I want to show you something.

179
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,666
Here.

180
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,416
Is this genuine from Indonesia?

181
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Yeah, it is.

182
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,583
Jokowi wears a ring like this.

183
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,666
Who is Jokowi?

184
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,875
Our President.

185
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,500
How much?

186
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,166
One Million Forint.

187
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,458
I could go to Indonesia
with that kind of money.

188
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,625
I have to go to the airport.

189
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,625
How about 500 thousand Forint?

190
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,250
Mrs. Arini?

191
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,875
I'm Panji.
Panji Rindu Alam.

192
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,666
The committee assigned me
to accompany you while you're here.

193
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,416
Sorry, I'm not Arini.

194
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,833
I am from Malaysia.

195
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,208
Oh, Malaysia.

196
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,916
Sheila, Sheila. Malaysia.

197
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,291
<i>I thought this is going to be</i>
<i>a long summer.</i>

198
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,250
Here, let me take your suitcase.

199
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,166
I don't know you!

200
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,375
I'm Panji.
It's okay, let me take your suitcase.

201
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,708
Don't mess with me!

202
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,291
Sorry, miss.

203
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,541
-Panji!
-Where are you, Ms. Sheila?

204
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,041
Hello?

205
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,833
<i>Panji.</i>

206
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,625
<i>I have been waiting for so long</i>
<i>at the airport...</i>

207
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,375
Where are you, exactly?

208
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,625
Don't panic, tell me
where you are exactly?

209
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,625
-Airport!
-I'm at the airport, too.

210
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,958
You're definitely not in the prayer room.
Exactly where are you?

211
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,166
How many times do I have to tell you?
We are near the stairs.

212
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,541
-Under the stairs.
-The stairs, the stairs.

213
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,458
I'm here below the stairs.
I'm touching it now.

214
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,375
-The stairs.
-Where are you?

215
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,041
-Hello? Which stairs?
-I'm touching the stairs right now.

216
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,500
The stairs can't go anywhere.

217
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,375
Sheila?

218
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,875
-I'm Panji.
-I'm Arini.

219
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:01,958
You're late!

220
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,708
Just got done being a dog.

221
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,125
I mean, I was dubbing as a dog,
for a TV show.

222
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,875
So, what are you,
a voice actor or a tour guide?

223
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,375
I can be everything.

224
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,208
Tour guide, driver, travel agent.

225
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,750
Here's a Hungarian tulip for you Sheila.

226
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,916
-This is fake.
-But it's waterproof.

227
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,500
Who are you looking for?

228
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,708
The driver.

229
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,750
Sheila, where did you find this person?

230
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,666
Welcome to Budapest.

231
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,416
I'm the driver.

232
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,166
Surprised, right?

233
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,208
I'm Panji Rindu Alam,
who will show you

234
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,416
the most beautiful city
in Eastern Europe.

235
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,625
Enjoy it.

236
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,625
<i>Budapest is made up of two cities.</i>

237
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,375
<i>Buda and Pest.</i>

238
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,541
<i>And they are connected by a bridge</i>

239
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,083
<i>across the Danube river.</i>

240
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:31,125
<i>The population is approximately</i>
<i>3.3 million.</i>

241
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:36,458
<i>This city is one of the most popular</i>
<i>destinations in Europe.</i>

242
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,333
<i>For tourists like you.</i>

243
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,166
<i>Panji, we are not here for a vacation.</i>

244
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,500
<i>We are invited by the Muslim Community of</i>
<i>Dar As-Salam Mosque.</i>

245
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,958
<i>One of the members published</i>
<i>Mrs. Arini's book.</i>

246
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:52,208
<i>Many young adults here really like</i>
<i>Mrs. Arini's book.</i>

247
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:57,625
<i>-Even though they are non-Muslims.</i>
<i>-Really? Thank God.</i>

248
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,500
Okay. This is the apartment.

249
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,875
There are about 28 thousand Muslims here.

250
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,000
And the numbers keep increasing.

251
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,416
Because of the book <i>Palace of Stars?</i>

252
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,500
No. Because there are a lot of problems.

253
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,875
Come on.

254
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,125
-Peace be with you.
-Peace be with you.

255
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,458
The room is over here.
The kitchen is over there.

256
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,041
Nadia, look.

257
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,583
Here.
There's a train.

258
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:00,833
Hello!

259
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,540
<i>My field of generosity</i>
<i>continues here, my love.</i>

260
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:10,958
<i>I am now at the center</i>
<i>of ancient Turkish glory</i>

261
00:17:11,415 --> 00:17:12,875
<i>in Europe.</i>

262
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:18,415
<i>Although Islam is underestimated here.</i>

263
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,915
<i>Because of all the stories in the news</i>

264
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,875
<i>the Moslems here appear to be united.</i>

265
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:29,291
<i>What makes them interested in Islam?</i>

266
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,708
Praise God.

267
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:50,791
Hon, I think I can gather useful
information here for my book.

268
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,166
<i>So, how are you?</i>

269
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,958
Terrible connection!

270
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,958
Har, you said you already
increased the capacity.

271
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,875
How should I know?
I'm not the internet guy.

272
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,500
If you want a good signal, go to the roof.

273
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:07,375
What? I am looking
into the raw material prices.

274
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,708
Materials from Syria?

275
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,916
I'm sure you're going to send
the budget to Mr. George late.

276
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,708
That's why I already sent a rough estimate
this afternoon.

277
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,000
Hey, you're taking over my work.

278
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,250
You can't do that!

279
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,000
Pras, you have to fire him!

280
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,416
He's taking over my work.
He can't do that, Pras.

281
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
I won't accept it.

282
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:27,166
If you had not been wasting time
stalking Sheila's Facebook,

283
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,041
you might have finished your work.

284
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,333
That's a lie.

285
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,416
-It's true!
-You lied!

286
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
-Burn him!
-Who?

287
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,583
-Burn him!
-Burn what?

288
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,666
Stop it!

289
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,208
I was the one who asked Hartono to send
the rough estimate earlier.

290
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,208
So Mr. George would have an idea.

291
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,375
But you still need to finish
your work tonight, Ran.

292
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,833
Send it tomorrow morning.

293
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,791
-All right.
-I'm leaving now.

294
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,333
Eat that.

295
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,750
-Here, I'm eating it.
-Chew it.

296
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,500
-Mrs. Arini?
-Yes.

297
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,291
I request you to read

298
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,833
this book to my friends.

299
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,291
Sorry, I'm...

300
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,708
-Arini.
-Syarief Kristof.

301
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,333
I am an oncologist here.

302
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:37,958
Oh, wow.

303
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:41,583
So, you are an Indonesian doctor
who practices here?

304
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,000
My mother is from Semarang.

305
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,541
She met my father, a Hungarian,

306
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,375
when he was studying in Yogyakarta.

307
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,291
I often read this book aloud to my friends
as part of their "treatment."

308
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,750
So, it would be very special if today
the author herself could read the book.

309
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,958
Treatment? What do you mean?

310
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,958
Mrs. Arini's schedule is full.

311
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:08,083
-Maybe if tomorrow...
-Mom and I will be there.

312
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,750
Okay. Thank you.

313
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,791
Thank you.
May I have your autograph, please?

314
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:13,875
Yes, sure.

315
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,458
Again, thank you for your time, ma'am.

316
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,291
You're welcome. I'll be there.

317
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,916
So, kids...

318
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,833
Here beside me is Mrs. Citra Arini.

319
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,708
She is the author of <i>Palace of Stars.</i>

320
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,666
Now,

321
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,333
she will read her novel to us.

322
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,541
What could be more beautiful

323
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,666
than the twinkle of stars at night?

324
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,458
I asked my mom before going to sleep.

325
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,125
Kids...

326
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,166
Michela

327
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,166
is asleep.

328
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,250
We can continue after this.

329
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,583
Oh, my God.

330
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:37,500
I would like to thank you, Mrs. Arini.

331
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,625
You made Michela's dream come true.

332
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,208
Dream?

333
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,458
Michela really liked <i>Palace of Stars.</i>

334
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,583
And during every chemotherapy session,

335
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:54,500
she would want someone
to read the book to her.

336
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,125
Her last wish was to meet the author.

337
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,375
That's why I went to see you, Mrs. Arini.

338
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,833
Again, thank you very much.

339
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,416
See you again.

340
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:37,500
<i>What happened to Michela</i>
<i>made me realize something.</i>

341
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:42,291
Death can approach us at any moment.

342
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,166
Don't say that, Rin.

343
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,625
Sheila.

344
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,041
Death is inevitable.

345
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,083
People who have faith will embrace it.

346
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,416
Do you have faith?

347
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,125
Do you?

348
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,083
If you want...

349
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,458
Hello.

350
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,791
Wait a minute.

351
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:39,541
Nadia.

352
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,333
Give me a chocolate, sweetheart.

353
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,291
We'll give it to him, okay?

354
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:19,291
-Arini?
-Mei.

355
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,791
-Aunt Mei.
-Nadia.

356
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:26,375
Mei.

357
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:30,625
Oh, my God, Meirose!

358
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:32,875
You...

359
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:36,041
Do you live here?

360
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:38,916
It's been three years.

361
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,250
Oh, my God.

362
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:42,541
Is this Akbar?

363
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,541
Akbar, you're so grown up now!

364
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:49,583
Nadia, this is your brother Akbar.

365
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:52,583
Akbar, this is your sister, Nadia.

366
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:53,833
Come on, shake hands.

367
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,958
He must be confused.

368
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:58,375
Do you remember her?

369
00:25:58,458 --> 00:25:59,833
Princess Sabrina.

370
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:02,000
How does he know that, Mei?

371
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:05,541
I always tell Akbar about Nadia's tale.

372
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:07,000
He loves it.

373
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,708
One kiss, please, one more.

374
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:14,333
-Peace be with you.
-Peace be with you.

375
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,208
Come here.

376
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,166
-Mrs. Arini.
-Yes.

377
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:24,958
I would like to introduce some members of
the Indonesian Muslim Community in Europe.

378
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:29,083
I'm Medina, chairman of the Indonesian
Muslim Community in Bosnia.

379
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:31,291
So glad you could visit, Mrs. Arini.

380
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:33,750
The pleasure is entirely mine.

381
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:38,916
I would love to hear
about your experiences here.

382
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:43,541
For your design, I want

383
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,833
various small domes, like this mosque.

384
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:52,750
-I need another day to make the revisions.
-It's okay. We still have time.

385
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:55,791
-Bud, please help to make the estimates.
-Okay.

386
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,416
Have you send the budget plan, Ran?

387
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:02,000
Where is Amran?

388
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:06,166
What do you want, my dear?

389
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,625
Rice from Yogya. Satay Klathak?

390
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:11,875
I'm not sure if the European food
will suit your taste buds.

391
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:17,208
<i>I think I would like rice from Yogya</i>
<i>or strange satay even less!</i>

392
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:19,875
Not strange satay, my dear.

393
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:22,208
Satay Klathak.

394
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,250
Har, what are you doing?

395
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,166
What are you doing up there?

396
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,625
Don't disturb me,
I'm courting my love.

397
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:31,291
On the neighbour's roof.

398
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:32,750
Whatever.

399
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:35,416
Honey. My darling.

400
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:39,166
It is true what they say.

401
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,250
If two people want to hang out,
the third person will be the devil.

402
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,041
-What did you say?
-The devil!

403
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,541
Now what?

404
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:53,125
Not me.

405
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,166
Peace be with you, Pras.

406
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,791
Have you sent the budget plan?

407
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:00,541
Budget plan?

408
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:02,458
Not yet.

409
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,291
-I'll just have to do it myself again?
-Lazy.

410
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:07,541
Work. Work. Work.

411
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:16,125
After several months in Jakarta,
I managed to email my father.

412
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:19,625
I was surprised he was in Hungary.

413
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:22,458
May I meet your father?

414
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,375
Unfortunately, my father passed away.

415
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,000
A year ago.

416
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,958
Oh, I'm so sorry.

417
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:35,125
So,

418
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:37,750
now we are the same, Mei.

419
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:41,708
My mother also passed away
about two years ago.

420
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,041
So, Mei, what do you do here now?

421
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,750
I opened a boutique with the
inheritance my father left me

422
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:57,041
and I help out the European Indonesian
Islamic Community here.

423
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,625
How's Pras?

424
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:06,666
He's good.

425
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:10,666
Thank God, he's fine. All is well.

426
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,083
In about

427
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,875
two days, he will join us here.

428
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,500
He will be so surprised to see you here.

429
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:26,500
-Okay.
-Here.

430
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,625
This one's better. Okay.

431
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:30,333
Smile!

432
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,458
Akbar.

433
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,041
One, two

434
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,625
That's nice. Wait a minute.

435
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,625
I want to check this out.
Just a minute, sweetheart.

436
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,708
Mom. I'm going over there, okay?

437
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:10,333
Nadia?

438
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:15,666
Nadia?

439
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:21,958
Nadia?

440
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,375
Nadia?

441
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,166
Nadia?

442
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,708
Nadia? Sweetheart?

443
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,333
Nadia?

444
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Nadia?

445
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:51,375
Nadia?

446
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:58,583
Oh, my God.

447
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,208
Mom!

448
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:04,291
Mom!

449
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:09,708
You're so mean, Mom.

450
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,875
Mom!

451
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Mom!

452
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,750
Mom!

453
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,000
Nadia!

454
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:38,416
Good afternoon, Mrs. Arini.

455
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,208
Sorry to disturb while you're resting.

456
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,041
How do you feel? Better?

457
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:50,625
Yes. Doctor, my daughter was right there.
Where is she now?

458
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,833
Perhaps with the nurse. I'll check.

459
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,583
From the CT Scan

460
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:08,416
It's cancer, isn't it?

461
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:18,166
Two years ago, I had a surgery
for cervical cancer.

462
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:22,833
The doctor assured me that
I was fully cured.

463
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:28,041
From the metastasis, it appears to have
already spread to the brain.

464
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,125
Brain?

465
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:31,666
Stage 4.

466
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:33,916
But these are preliminary results.

467
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,083
There are still several tests to be done.

468
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:39,875
-To make sure that this...
-How much time do I have?

469
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:43,791
Two years?

470
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:46,666
One year?

471
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:04,708
Without treatment, it could be less.

472
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:16,166
Therefore,
I need to perform a biopsy procedure

473
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,833
-to find out more.
-No.

474
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:20,250
Please, Doctor.

475
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:22,416
I don't want to go through that.

476
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,250
I don't want a biopsy done.

477
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:29,083
I've already been through
several types of treatments, Doctor.

478
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:32,500
And I don't want go through that again.

479
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:40,250
Please don't give up, Mrs. Arini,

480
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,625
you need to continue fighting.

481
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:49,000
Mom.

482
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,833
I don't want to fight the will of God.

483
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:04,125
You have a husband, a child.

484
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:07,000
What about them, ma'am?

485
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:12,083
Please don't let them know about
my condition, Doctor.

486
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:14,875
Mrs. Arini, at times like this,

487
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,583
the support of your family
is very important.

488
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:21,208
But, by not knowing my condition,

489
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:25,458
they will already be
supporting me, Doctor.

490
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,166
Please.

491
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:32,500
Don't tell them, please.

492
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,458
Please don't tell my daughter.

493
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,500
Nadia should never know

494
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:45,625
about my illness, please.

495
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,083
All right.

496
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,458
I'll contact the doctor who treated you,
Mrs. Arini.

497
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,958
-Good afternoon.
-Afternoon.

498
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:25,750
Mom.

499
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:57,833
Nadia?

500
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:00,333
How long have you been standing there?

501
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,250
Here. Come to me.

502
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,375
What is it, Nadia?

503
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:16,083
I love you, Mom.

504
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:20,750
I love you, too.

505
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,541
Nadia...

506
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:41,250
The doctor said I'm fine.

507
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:46,000
I just need to rest.

508
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:49,666
If I rest well

509
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,916
and eat properly, I'll be fine.

510
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,750
I promise never to be naughty again.

511
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:09,000
Sometimes I don't listen to you.

512
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:12,208
You are not naughty.

513
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,208
Look at me. Here.

514
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:19,833
You have never been naughty.

515
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:22,458
You're an amazing child.

516
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:25,625
You're smart.

517
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:28,458
You are my Princess Sabrina.

518
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,708
Please, don't be like this.

519
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:32,625
Don't be sad, my beautiful girl.

520
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:33,708
Okay?

521
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:47,958
Are you looking at
my mother's results, Uncle?

522
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,250
Nadia.

523
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,833
Come on in.

524
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:00,250
Have you eaten?

525
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:04,916
I have a sandwich, I made it myself.

526
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,250
-It has tuna, beef...
-Is my mom dying, Uncle?

527
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:15,166
No, she's not dying.

528
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,458
Who told you that?

529
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,916
I heard it myself.

530
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
The cancer has spread to the brain, right?

531
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,083
Nadia.

532
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:27,375
Nadia, wait.

533
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:54,291
Nadia.

534
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,208
Is there anything I can do for you?

535
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:04,458
I promise I'll do anything you wish.

536
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:10,916
Do you have a wife, Uncle?

537
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,166
Not yet.

538
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,541
But I have a special friend.

539
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:23,500
What would you do

540
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:26,791
if your special friend were dying?

541
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:39,416
I would make her the happiest woman
in the world.

542
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:43,333
I would do whatever she wished.

543
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:54,333
You know, Nadia?

544
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:59,250
I very rarely buy ice cream for anyone.

545
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,083
But

546
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,708
if it's a special person, I'll buy it.

547
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:07,291
Well, this is the first time
I'm buying ice cream for someone.

548
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:10,875
Your special friend, is she Hungarian?

549
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,250
My special friend

550
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:17,958
is beautiful like you.

551
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,500
Nadia.

552
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,916
Do you want to help me

553
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,083
pick a special gift
for my special friend?

554
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:32,458
Yes.

555
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:53,416
Uncle?

556
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:58,333
This is cute for your friend.

557
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:03,333
Why not the big one?

558
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:06,708
You can only hug a big bear in your room.

559
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:10,041
But you can take a little one
everywhere.

560
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:17,541
I have something for you, too.

561
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:24,875
This necklace is for you.

562
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:28,791
The other one is for me.

563
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:34,416
I'll keep this half forever, Mom.

564
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:40,500
Thank you, sweetheart.

565
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:42,250
Here.

566
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:47,750
Let Mom help Princess Sabrina
put the necklace on.

567
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:58,166
Peace be with you.

568
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:00,958
Yes, Sheila.

569
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,000
No, Sheila. I'm fine.

570
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:06,166
The doctor said I was just too tired.

571
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,916
So please pick me up, okay.

572
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,583
Peace be with you.

573
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:22,291
Why is the doll from Doctor Syarief
so weak?

574
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:26,166
What's wrong with the queen?

575
00:43:26,666 --> 00:43:28,875
Princess Sabrina

576
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:31,458
is taking care of her mother

577
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:33,916
who is sick.

578
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:38,875
What's wrong with her mom?

579
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,708
She has an illness
that cannot be cured easily.

580
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,750
So, Princess Sabrina must be sad?

581
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:56,208
Yes.

582
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:01,666
If it turns out

583
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:07,375
that the queen can't be cured,
what would happen then?

584
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:12,583
Princess Sabrina will be sad

585
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:16,291
and will miss her mother.

586
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:24,416
Princess Sabrina should not be sad.

587
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,791
Look at this.

588
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:29,708
Princess Sabrina.

589
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:33,833
Princess Sabrina, do you
still remember the good fairy?

590
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:37,833
There is a good fairy

591
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:43,458
who will turn into the queen.

592
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:47,708
And a mother for Princess Sabrina.

593
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:54,750
Princess Sabrina and the good fairy
will become a family.

594
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:57,750
Together with the king.

595
00:44:58,166 --> 00:44:59,500
Are you happy?

596
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:23,041
Do you know why
there are four letters in LOVE?

597
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:26,416
Each letter is like a pillar
that supports the roof of a house.

598
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,333
They are not crowded together, but close
enough to support each other.

599
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:31,166
That's the nature of love.

600
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,625
Taking care each other,
while giving each other space.

601
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,416
Khalil Gibran, <i>The Lover.</i>

602
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:41,541
You already quoted Pablo Neruda,
Shakespeare and Khalil Gibran.

603
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:44,625
Whose words will you use
next to win me over?

604
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:50,625
Naturally, my soul and your soul
will connect in the sky.

605
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,833
Our children will be born on the horizon.

606
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:57,125
And we will look into each other's
eyes for centuries.

607
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:59,625
My Juwita, beautiful so naturally.

608
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:02,166
My life is open for you.

609
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,875
This moment wouldn't be complete
without the poetry of Rendra.

610
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:06,916
You're smart.

611
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,708
If you're quoting W.S. Rendra,
then I'm truly flattered.

612
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:13,625
Will you marry me, Mei?

613
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:26,750
Mei.

614
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:28,666
I have thought this through.

615
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:30,500
I'm serious.

616
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:34,416
I want you to be with me.

617
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:39,291
But you know

618
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:42,000
I have a troubled past?

619
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:47,750
Your past is yours alone.

620
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:50,333
What I want from you is your future.

621
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:55,041
But I have unfinished business.

622
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,041
Give me time?

623
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:02,416
Okay. I'll wait.

624
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:08,041
Okay.

625
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,375
You seriously want Meirose
to get back together with Pras?

626
00:48:15,541 --> 00:48:18,250
I've heard the stories,
I'm so glad

627
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:20,541
-she's no longer a part of your life.
-Sheila.

628
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:22,791
Pras never divorced her.

629
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:32,916
She's the only one who can
take my place in Nadia and Pras' lives.

630
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:36,708
Where are you going?

631
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,500
Arini!

632
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,166
Where is the key?

633
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,500
Where are you going?

634
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:46,250
Sheila, we never know
how long we will live.

635
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:48,041
I'm just preparing.

636
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:56,833
You are Nadia's mother.

637
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:05,375
Sheila, stop worrying.

638
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:07,458
Don't be scared, okay?

639
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:13,000
I just want

640
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:17,125
Pras to get back together with Mei.

641
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:18,791
Where is the key?

642
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:21,625
You are crazy. Understand?

643
00:49:27,541 --> 00:49:28,541
Mom!

644
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:29,625
WELCOME BACK, MOM.

645
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:35,208
Nadia!

646
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:43,958
Thank you, sweetheart.

647
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:49,333
I bought two tickets for us.

648
00:49:49,416 --> 00:49:50,416
To where?

649
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,708
Szentendre, to meet Aunt Mei.

650
00:49:57,958 --> 00:50:00,916
I need to watch over you two.

651
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,208
Let Panji pick up Pras from the airport.

652
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,833
No, Sheila. Please go with Panji
to fetch Pras from the airport.

653
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:07,666
I'll go with Nadia.

654
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,125
Sheila, one more thing.

655
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:12,166
Please clear the rest
of my schedule here, Sheila.

656
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:13,375
I need to rest.

657
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:15,333
Rest?
At Meirose's place?

658
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:16,416
No way!

659
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,083
You need to do an interview with
the publisher, reporters and many more.

660
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:24,333
You are my manager,
you should be helping me.

661
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:26,458
Panji, please accompany her.

662
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:27,708
-Oh, okay.
-Let's go now.

663
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,750
-Peace be with you.
-Bye, Panji.

664
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:32,291
-Arini!
-Don't be upset.

665
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:35,291
Here, I brought you another
Hungarian tulip.

666
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:39,583
So your heart will be as clear and calm
as the Danube river.

667
00:50:40,291 --> 00:50:41,791
It's fake again!

668
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:45,916
It was buy one, get one, Sheila.

669
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:51,333
Hello, Rief. Yes.
Where are you?

670
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:52,625
The train is arriving.

671
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:55,708
<i>Sorry, I already left this morning.</i>
<i>I took the morning train.</i>

672
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,666
Oh? Why didn't you tell me?

673
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,958
If I had known
I would not need to do this.

674
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:01,583
-Prepare...
-Would not need to do what?

675
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Not funny.

676
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:06,875
I'm kidding. Sorry.

677
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:08,250
You were looking for me?

678
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:11,125
-Afraid to lose me?
-You think?

679
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,375
Oh, my God!
What is this?

680
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:18,958
Sandwich filled with love.

681
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:20,416
Akbar.

682
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:22,500
I have to go now. Bye.

683
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:49,750
Aunt Mei!

684
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:51,833
Hi!

685
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,500
Mei.

686
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:56,041
My goodness! You're here.

687
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:57,125
Hi.

688
00:51:57,208 --> 00:52:02,541
Nadia and I wanted to
surprise you and Akbar.

689
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:05,125
Who would have thought
we would meet here?

690
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,208
Well then, let's go to my home.

691
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:10,166
Yes.

692
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,791
-Peace be with you.
-Peace be with you.

693
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:01,875
Aunt Mei?

694
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:11,166
Thank you

695
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,958
for taking care of Akbar all this time.

696
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,750
Be careful, Mei.

697
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,416
-Peace be with you.
-Peace be with you.

698
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,541
Akbar, do you want to go to Indonesia?

699
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:56,875
The weather is warm there, not cold.

700
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:58,916
Thank you, Mei. Sorry to bother you.

701
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,250
Not at all.

702
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:02,333
-Go tell your Mom.
-I'll have a drink.

703
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:04,125
-Hi!
-Mom.

704
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:05,708
-Yes?
-Let's go to Indonesia.

705
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:08,125
Nadia told me it's nice there.

706
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:09,625
The weather is warm.

707
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:14,708
When you're older,
we'll go to Indonesia. Okay?

708
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:22,166
-Arini?
-Yes?

709
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:26,541
You look a bit pale.

710
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:32,833
I'm just tired, Mei.

711
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:35,625
My schedule here has been packed.

712
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:38,250
Doing interviews, meeting with publishers.

713
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,583
Hey, let's go somewhere.
Let's go eat.

714
00:54:42,666 --> 00:54:44,083
-Come on, Akbar.
-All right.

715
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:45,250
We'll have lunch.

716
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:47,458
There's a nice restaurant near here.

717
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:49,541
Akbar's favorite.

718
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:53,625
Should we buy some groceries
and cook at home?

719
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,041
Sure, we can do that. What do you think?

720
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:58,166
You're such a smart little girl.

721
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:59,250
Okay?

722
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:00,666
Okay. Come on.

723
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,125
Where is the patient?

724
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:06,541
She left this morning.

725
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:09,666
She left?

726
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:14,750
She asked me to give you
this letter, Doctor.

727
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:18,541
Uncle Syarief
I already know what mom's last wish is.

728
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:21,500
Please pray that I can make it
come true. From Nadia

729
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:29,625
This is exciting, isn't it?

730
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,750
Pass me the salt, sweetheart.

731
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,458
Here, Aunt Mei.

732
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:36,125
Thank you.

733
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:45,666
You need to learn how to make
sauteed vegetables with egg and tofu

734
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,250
in tomato sauce.

735
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:50,083
It's mine and Dad's favorite.

736
00:55:50,166 --> 00:55:51,166
Oh, yeah?

737
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,250
Yes.

738
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:54,416
Okay, I'm trying to make that right now.

739
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:03,041
Tomorrow I have a surgery scheduled.
Please pray for me.

740
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,500
-Princess Sabrina.
-Prince Akbar.

741
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:12,083
-Princess Sabrina.
-Prince Akbar.

742
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:14,541
And finally they hug each other.

743
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:16,250
What's his name?

744
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:19,666
-Prince Akbar.
-Prince Akbar.

745
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:22,958
And then, the Queen asked,

746
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:28,041
"Prince Akbar, could you please

747
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:31,791
LETTER OF DIVORCE

748
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:34,208
for a walk in the park.

749
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:35,291
Can you do that?

750
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:37,333
I'm already in Budapest, Nit.

751
00:56:37,416 --> 00:56:40,541
I'll Skype you as soon as I have Wi-Fi.

752
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:43,125
What is that?

753
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:45,916
You're so cheap! Not wanting to spend
money on your date!

754
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
You're the same!

755
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:50,333
Who went all the way to the roof
yesterday looking for a signal?

756
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:52,583
Nonsense!

757
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:54,333
That's different.

758
00:56:54,416 --> 00:56:57,416
That's called making an effort.
Since Sheila is not my girlfriend, yet.

759
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,708
Who cares? You're so lame.

760
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:05,250
Amran!

761
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:30,708
Honey?

762
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:33,875
Why do you smell so different?

763
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:35,666
I just put some balm on.

764
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:37,625
Oh, my God.

765
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,166
No wonder you smell like a corpse.

766
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,791
But you still wanted to hug me.

767
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:41,875
Who are you?

768
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,458
You're the one who hugged me.

769
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:45,125
This is Panji.

770
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:47,416
Not too close.

771
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:49,500
Enough!

772
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:51,583
We just got here and you're already
making so much noise!

773
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:53,708
Sheila, where are Arini and Nadia?

774
00:57:55,916 --> 00:58:00,166
Me and Panji,
will take Amran and Hartono

775
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:04,333
to the apartment,
but you will go to Szentendre.

776
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,250
Szentendre?

777
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,708
Whose place is it?

778
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,125
Go get the suitcases.

779
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:35,750
Come on, Akbar. Call my dad "Daddy,"
not uncle. Come on.

780
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:37,333
I don't want to!

781
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:39,875
Akbar, please.

782
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,625
Akbar. Call him "Daddy," not uncle, okay.

783
00:58:42,708 --> 00:58:44,125
Call him "Daddy."

784
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:46,250
This is your dad.

785
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:48,666
Call him Daddy, not uncle.

786
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,083
Come on, Akbar.

787
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:51,166
I don't want to!

788
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:52,833
I don't want to!

789
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:54,875
Akbar.

790
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,500
Nadia?

791
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,625
Nadia! Please stop, sweetheart!
I want to talk to you.

792
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:08,666
What's wrong, sweetheart?

793
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:10,333
What is it?

794
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:12,500
What happened to Akbar?

795
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:14,125
Tell me.

796
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:19,208
I want to make your wish come true.

797
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:23,208
What wish, sweetheart?

798
00:59:23,291 --> 00:59:24,583
What wish?

799
00:59:25,583 --> 00:59:30,041
You want Aunt Mei to become
my mother, right?

800
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:32,666
Before you die.

801
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:57,541
I'm sorry, Mom.

802
00:59:57,625 --> 01:00:01,666
I wasn't able to make your wish come true.

803
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:03,583
You didn't do anything wrong.

804
01:00:14,291 --> 01:00:15,291
Nadia.

805
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,791
Daddy.

806
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:24,583
I missed you so much, Princess Sabrina.

807
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,791
Has it been cold here?

808
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:31,833
How are you, honey?

809
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:32,916
I'm fine. Thank God.

810
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,208
Come, come. Let's go inside.

811
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:38,208
Peace be with you.

812
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:42,500
Whose place is this?

813
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:49,416
Meirose?

814
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:05,250
Daddy. That's Akbar.

815
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:08,750
Akbar.

816
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:10,708
You're so big.

817
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:12,958
Come here, Akbar.

818
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
That's crazy.

819
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,000
There are more than 10,000
beautiful cities in this world.

820
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:30,000
How did they happen to meet
here in Budapest?

821
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:31,916
It's fate, Har.

822
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:34,291
Fate to commit polygamy again?

823
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:38,333
I told you.

824
01:01:38,416 --> 01:01:40,208
Meirose loves Pras.

825
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:41,750
Pras loves Meirose.

826
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:44,541
Arini accepts it.
So, what's wrong?

827
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:46,583
I don't understand the way you think!

828
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:48,875
There must be something wrong.

829
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:51,875
She asked me to clear her schedule.

830
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:57,375
What do you mean?

831
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:05,208
When you were a baby,
Daddy used to carry you.

832
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:06,791
Yes.

833
01:02:06,875 --> 01:02:08,708
Where did we go on holiday, Nadia?

834
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,958
Parangtritis Beach.

835
01:02:11,041 --> 01:02:12,208
Yes.

836
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:16,291
Aunt Mei cooked today, Dad.

837
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:18,625
And you helped me, right?

838
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:21,791
You know, aside from running
a boutique here,

839
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:23,875
Mei is also a counselor
for the Muslim Community.

840
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:24,958
Right, Mei?

841
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,458
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

842
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:29,125
She has converted three people.

843
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:30,750
Is it true, Mei?

844
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:33,750
I just shared my own learning experience.

845
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:37,875
Knowledge that I gained
from Arini and you

846
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:40,041
when I was in trouble.

847
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:43,500
Where are you staying exactly, Rin?

848
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:45,041
Is it far from here?

849
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:47,166
Yes.

850
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,666
It's quite far, hon.

851
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:52,500
About 30 minutes by train.

852
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:53,583
Oh, not so far.

853
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:56,250
Well then, after we finish dinner,

854
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:58,750
let's go back to your place, okay?

855
01:02:58,833 --> 01:03:01,541
Why don't we spend the night here?

856
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:04,083
I still wish to be with Akbar.

857
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:06,291
Can we, Aunt Mei?

858
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:13,458
Oh, my God!

859
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:21,750
What are you doing?

860
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,250
I just wanted to make a sandwich.

861
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:27,625
You already ate, right?

862
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:30,375
I'm hungry again.

863
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:32,416
Okay.

864
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,500
All right.

865
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:35,083
It's okay, I'll do it.

866
01:04:35,166 --> 01:04:36,875
Won't be so good piled on like that.

867
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:38,416
Let me help you.

868
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
You like cheese now?

869
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:48,000
I thought you never liked it.

870
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:49,083
No.

871
01:04:49,875 --> 01:04:51,958
Still. I don't. No. I mean

872
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:55,041
-You like it or not?
-I still don't like it.

873
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:57,166
You still don't like it. Okay.

874
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:01,750
-Mayonnaise?
-Oh, yes.

875
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:03,000
Could you get it for me?

876
01:05:09,791 --> 01:05:11,750
You have to open it first.

877
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:22,000
Don't rub it. Let me clean your face.
Just a moment.

878
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:34,291
Okay.

879
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:53,250
Here you go.

880
01:05:53,791 --> 01:05:54,791
Thank you.

881
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:56,958
You're welcome.

882
01:05:57,583 --> 01:05:58,750
I'm going to sleep now.

883
01:05:58,833 --> 01:05:59,958
-Yes.
-Okay.

884
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:14,083
I think this is the place.

885
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:15,375
Meirose Corner.

886
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:16,458
Yes.

887
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,750
-Peace be with you.
-Peace be with you.

888
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:27,541
This is your boutique, Mei?

889
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:31,125
-Akbar.
-My goodness!

890
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:34,125
-Mom.
-Yes, sweetheart?

891
01:06:34,208 --> 01:06:35,583
The arrangement is nice, Mei.

892
01:06:58,541 --> 01:06:59,583
What's wrong, Mei?

893
01:06:59,666 --> 01:07:01,333
I have to go.

894
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:04,125
I have to deliver some orders
and I forgot.

895
01:07:04,208 --> 01:07:05,208
But, wait, wait.

896
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:07,750
You're bringing so many things alone?

897
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:09,458
I'm used to this.

898
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:12,500
Please go with Mei, honey.

899
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:13,583
Give her a ride, hon.

900
01:07:13,666 --> 01:07:14,666
You see that?

901
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:17,333
How can Mei go alone with so many things?
Please help her.

902
01:07:17,416 --> 01:07:18,416
Please, honey?

903
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,208
And you can sightsee at the same time.

904
01:07:20,291 --> 01:07:22,666
Nadia, please go with Dad.

905
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:25,375
-You can watch Akbar, too.
-Okay.

906
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,458
Are you coming with us, Rin?

907
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:27,541
Me?

908
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:28,958
It's very cold outside, hon.

909
01:07:29,041 --> 01:07:31,000
I think I'm just going to rest, okay.

910
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:32,791
You all please go.
Do some sightseeing.

911
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:34,166
You haven't had a chance
to do that yet, right?

912
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,500
Actually, you all can stay here.

913
01:07:36,583 --> 01:07:38,833
Akbar's nanny is already on the way here.

914
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:41,000
I'm used to doing this alone.

915
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:42,083
No need, Mei.

916
01:07:42,166 --> 01:07:44,000
-Pras hasn't had a chance for sightseeing.
-Yes, dear.

917
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:45,833
You wanted to take
some pictures, too, right?

918
01:07:45,916 --> 01:07:46,916
-Yes?
-Yes.

919
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Actually, I just need
to deliver these items today.

920
01:07:49,083 --> 01:07:50,083
Let me help you, Mei.

921
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:54,791
-Be careful, sweetheart.
-Akbar's nanny will be here soon.

922
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:57,166
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, sweetheart. Be careful.

923
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:00,166
-Bye, honey.
-Yes, be careful, hon.

924
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,541
You too, be careful.

925
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:03,875
-Peace be with you.
-Peace be with you.

926
01:08:13,291 --> 01:08:14,500
Come on, sweetheart.

927
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:16,082
Come.

928
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:18,916
Nadia! Nadia!

929
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,541
I'm sorry. I'm late, sir.

930
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:22,291
My staff suddenly fell ill.

931
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:23,875
It's okay, Meirose.

932
01:08:23,957 --> 01:08:25,916
You are always on time. It's not an issue.

933
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Thank you.

934
01:08:27,707 --> 01:08:28,707
Hi, Akbar.

935
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:30,625
I have a fairy tale book for you.

936
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:31,875
I will ask your mom to pass it on to you.

937
01:08:31,957 --> 01:08:32,957
Thank you.

938
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:49,416
<i>I'm glad</i>

939
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:52,916
<i>to see that you are appreciated here.</i>

940
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,291
Yes.

941
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:59,457
Sometimes it's difficult to live
in a non-Muslim country.

942
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:01,250
Especially after the Syria incidents.

943
01:09:02,332 --> 01:09:04,541
Many immigrants came to Europe

944
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:07,625
and they're considered a
burden to the country.

945
01:09:08,957 --> 01:09:10,791
How did you survive?

946
01:09:16,082 --> 01:09:21,707
I never stopped thinking
about you and Akbar.

947
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,791
Oh, really?

948
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:24,750
I thought you forgot about us.

949
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:28,791
You just said you are always positive.

950
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:33,416
Arini and I tried to find many ways
to contact you.

951
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,416
And Nadia always asked about Akbar.

952
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:42,541
I didn't want to be found.

953
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:44,375
I didn't want to bother you.

954
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:49,916
And I didn't want you to feel
the need to always be fair.

955
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:58,166
Have you

956
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:02,291
found a new dad for Akbar?

957
01:10:08,416 --> 01:10:11,000
Akbar! Akbar!

958
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:14,166
Dad! Aunt Mei!

959
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:17,250
Akbar can't breathe.

960
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:18,500
-Can't breathe?
-Did he eat chocolate?

961
01:10:18,583 --> 01:10:20,416
No, just this.

962
01:10:21,166 --> 01:10:22,916
That's white chocolate, Nadia.

963
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,458
It's got nuts in it.

964
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:25,625
He's allergic.

965
01:10:25,708 --> 01:10:27,083
We need to see a doctor.

966
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,833
Akbar is the only one I have, Pras.

967
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:58,291
I don't want to lose him.

968
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:26,875
Just pray, Mei.

969
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:28,541
Just pray.

970
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:45,000
Where are my toiletries?

971
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:46,083
I can't find them.

972
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:47,458
Did the maid forget to pack them?

973
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:50,458
It's there. I prepared everything.

974
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:53,375
I put them all in one bag.

975
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:54,500
There you go.

976
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:58,416
There's your shampoo, soap,
and face wash, too.

977
01:13:00,958 --> 01:13:03,208
You hate it when you don't wash
your face all day, right?

978
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:05,583
Only you can do all this for me.

979
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:09,583
I don't know what I would do without you.

980
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,708
Don't say that.

981
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:13,958
I've written everything in a book.

982
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:18,291
So, you don't need to depend on me.

983
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:21,541
No. I like depending on you.

984
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:24,125
Who else would I depend on?

985
01:13:25,541 --> 01:13:26,750
Only you.

986
01:13:28,916 --> 01:13:31,208
-Enough. Go take a shower.
-Yes.

987
01:13:42,958 --> 01:13:44,166
Oh, my God!

988
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:04,041
LETTER OF DIVORCE

989
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:09,458
The surgery went well, Mei.

990
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:11,458
Thank you for giving me your strength.

991
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:12,750
I miss you.

992
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:22,375
-Honey?
-Yes.

993
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,500
Just a second.

994
01:14:29,375 --> 01:14:30,375
What is it, hon?

995
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:31,916
Actually, I wanted

996
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:34,583
to discuss this last night.

997
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:39,041
What is this?

998
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:44,583
It looks like it was fated for us
to meet Meirose here.

999
01:14:44,666 --> 01:14:45,666
LETTER OF DIVORCE

1000
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:48,041
So that I can settle everything soon.

1001
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:53,166
What do you mean?

1002
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:06,125
Honey, this is...

1003
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:08,750
-Why did you write this letter?
-Honey.

1004
01:15:10,041 --> 01:15:11,625
I'm going to divorce Meirose.

1005
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,750
She has a good life here.

1006
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:17,583
I've seen it for myself.

1007
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:20,250
And it would be unfair

1008
01:15:20,333 --> 01:15:22,291
for me to continue tying her down.

1009
01:15:25,375 --> 01:15:26,375
Now,

1010
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:31,291
there's only me, you and Nadia.

1011
01:15:55,875 --> 01:16:01,416
<i>Dark clouds are rolling in</i>

1012
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:06,750
<i>Bearing such sad news</i>

1013
01:16:06,833 --> 01:16:12,458
<i>What can I do for my love?</i>

1014
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:22,125
<i>Can I become the sky</i>

1015
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:27,166
<i>That protects you</i>

1016
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,833
<i>So that sadness</i>

1017
01:16:29,916 --> 01:16:32,375
Mei, why don't you come with us?

1018
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:36,000
We have a car,
Panji will pick us up, right, hon?

1019
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:39,666
I still have some errands. I need to go
to the Dar As-Salam mosque after this.

1020
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,458
-Okay.
-You guys go ahead.

1021
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:46,083
Bye, sweetheart.
Give me a kiss.

1022
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:48,041
You be careful.

1023
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:49,291
-Bye, Aunt Mei.
-Bye.

1024
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:51,041
-Bye.
-Peace be with you, Mei.

1025
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:57,708
-Arini.
-Hartono.

1026
01:16:57,958 --> 01:16:59,958
Why are you here alone?
Where is Panji?

1027
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:01,708
He's got something to do.
So, I'll drive.

1028
01:17:01,791 --> 01:17:02,791
You'll drive?

1029
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,208
-Yes, GPS.
-Oh.

1030
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:05,750
-Come on.
-Where is Sheila?

1031
01:17:06,041 --> 01:17:09,375
It's complicated.
Some sort of incident with a tulip.

1032
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,458
What do you mean?

1033
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:30,958
Yes?

1034
01:17:42,041 --> 01:17:47,791
Oh, wow. It means Sheila
is going to accept Amran?

1035
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:50,583
Wait. The story isn't finished yet.

1036
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:51,666
This is what happened...

1037
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:54,958
You sure take your time to dress up.

1038
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:58,333
I'm going to meet the woman I love,
I need to look handsome, Hartono.

1039
01:17:58,416 --> 01:17:59,791
Even abroad you look so strange.

1040
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,958
Whatever! The important thing is that
I'm going to meet Sheila.

1041
01:18:02,041 --> 01:18:04,916
I have to look good.
Really good.

1042
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,500
This is it.

1043
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,916
That corpse again.

1044
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,416
Amran.
Hartono.

1045
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:16,208
I'm going to take you guys to dinner
with Pras and Arini, okay?

1046
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:17,833
-Great.
-Please.

1047
01:18:17,916 --> 01:18:21,041
-Come. Hurry.
-Whatever. I don't care.

1048
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,166
-Har.
-What is it?

1049
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,208
Honey, why do you smell different again?

1050
01:18:46,291 --> 01:18:49,708
This time you smell of
some kind of spice.

1051
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,833
Yes. I'm using a chili based ointment.

1052
01:18:51,916 --> 01:18:52,916
Oh, my God!

1053
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
You again?

1054
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:55,833
You were already in the car.

1055
01:18:55,916 --> 01:18:58,333
I was just about to open the door
when you hugged me again.

1056
01:18:58,416 --> 01:19:00,125
No one wants to hug you.

1057
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:02,583
-I didn't want to be hugged either.
-Panji.

1058
01:19:02,666 --> 01:19:04,958
Thank you for the real tulip.

1059
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:06,916
-Tulip?
-Tulip?

1060
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:08,666
How did you know?

1061
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:10,041
What do you mean?

1062
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:13,500
Oh, yes. The tulip
in front of your room...

1063
01:19:13,583 --> 01:19:16,625
I prepared it as promised.

1064
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,333
Oh, my God. More tulips.

1065
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:29,166
-What happened to him?
-It's nothing.

1066
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:31,041
His stomach acts up in the cold.

1067
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:36,583
Can he use the chili ointment?

1068
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:42,041
Poor Amran.

1069
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:43,708
It's his own fault.

1070
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:46,083
He wants to date all the girls.

1071
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:48,208
Gita, Rita, Sheila. Oh, man!

1072
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:50,416
-Forget it. Let's go.
-Come on.

1073
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:05,750
What is it, sweetheart?

1074
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:07,166
You're sad?

1075
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:08,958
You're missing Akbar?

1076
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:13,875
We will see him again, okay?

1077
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:19,708
He doesn't want to divorce you?

1078
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:22,500
I have not asked.

1079
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,500
But

1080
01:20:24,791 --> 01:20:28,458
the strange thing is,
his wife does not want me to divorce him.

1081
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:31,041
-Wow.
-Yes.

1082
01:20:32,291 --> 01:20:38,541
That kind of woman
can only be found in fairy tales.

1083
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:40,000
No, I mean,

1084
01:20:40,541 --> 01:20:42,500
I have a female patient.

1085
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:44,791
She has a serious illness.

1086
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:46,666
But she chooses to hide

1087
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:48,750
from her daughter and husband.

1088
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:51,500
So, strong women exist.

1089
01:20:58,333 --> 01:20:59,333
Arini.

1090
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:01,000
-George.
-Arini.

1091
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:05,041
Hi. Hello.

1092
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:23,458
-I need to go to the rest room.
-Okay.

1093
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:47,500
Arini?

1094
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:54,375
Arini!

1095
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:58,625
Sorry, I'll call you back.

1096
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:43,875
Why didn't you tell me, Arini?

1097
01:22:54,875 --> 01:22:58,083
I didn't want you to worry, my love.

1098
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,291
I'll do anything to help you get better.

1099
01:23:06,083 --> 01:23:07,083
Enough.

1100
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,916
Enough, honey.

1101
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:16,416
I don't want us to suffer.

1102
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:17,500
No.

1103
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,125
No, honey.

1104
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:23,500
We can still try.

1105
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:26,333
Enough.

1106
01:23:50,541 --> 01:23:51,541
Pras.

1107
01:23:56,958 --> 01:24:00,541
How did I not know
my own wife was ill?

1108
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:08,333
Don't blame yourself.

1109
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:12,416
We are trying our best to cure Arini.

1110
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:26,458
Is there a mosque near here, Doc?

1111
01:24:27,208 --> 01:24:28,208
Yes.

1112
01:24:28,291 --> 01:24:30,291
Dar As-salam Mosque.
Not far from here.

1113
01:24:30,375 --> 01:24:31,458
Can I take you there?

1114
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:33,958
No, it's okay.

1115
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:36,625
Just give me the directions.

1116
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:40,916
I would be happy to walk with you.

1117
01:24:52,208 --> 01:24:53,208
I...

1118
01:24:54,541 --> 01:24:56,458
For as long as I've been a doctor,

1119
01:24:56,541 --> 01:25:00,500
I have never met a patient
as strong as Arini.

1120
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,333
She is a great woman.

1121
01:25:04,791 --> 01:25:08,083
You're very lucky
to have her as your wife.

1122
01:25:13,416 --> 01:25:14,833
Thank you, Doctor.

1123
01:25:19,166 --> 01:25:20,750
Are you married, Doctor?

1124
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:22,458
Not yet.

1125
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:25,125
Still in the process.

1126
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:27,875
She...

1127
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:31,166
Hasn't resolved her past.

1128
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:33,000
Well, I can only wait.

1129
01:25:37,208 --> 01:25:38,791
Before I got married,

1130
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:45,333
Arini's father said to me...

1131
01:25:46,625 --> 01:25:51,250
You give me your word?

1132
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:56,041
That you'll never hurt my child, my Arini?

1133
01:25:56,916 --> 01:26:01,208
I promise to take good care of her.

1134
01:26:02,166 --> 01:26:04,416
To be a responsible man.

1135
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:07,708
And to love Arini completely, sir.

1136
01:26:25,208 --> 01:26:28,333
I have failed to keep my promise, Doc.

1137
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:45,708
Oh, God.

1138
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:49,416
Oh, God.

1139
01:26:55,333 --> 01:26:56,583
Sorry, Doc.

1140
01:26:57,416 --> 01:26:58,750
It's okay.

1141
01:27:06,708 --> 01:27:07,708
I...

1142
01:27:11,166 --> 01:27:15,125
-I need to be alone.
-Okay.

1143
01:27:26,583 --> 01:27:30,666
<i>I would like to deliver</i>

1144
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:35,083
<i>A last message to you</i>

1145
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:42,166
<i>Before I close this love story of ours</i>

1146
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:48,416
<i>If I were just a word</i>

1147
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:53,166
<i>Together we are a sentence</i>

1148
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:56,458
<i>That tells the tale</i>

1149
01:27:56,541 --> 01:28:00,333
<i>Of the course of our love</i>

1150
01:28:00,416 --> 01:28:04,291
<i>You are used to the way I am</i>

1151
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:09,125
<i>And used to having me around</i>

1152
01:28:09,208 --> 01:28:10,708
-Peace be with you.
-Can I have your number, please?

1153
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:14,208
<i>But don't let this life end</i>

1154
01:28:14,291 --> 01:28:15,583
<i>In case I have to go</i>

1155
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:20,166
Do you believe he could be
a good husband for you?

1156
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:24,625
Who can guarantee
how a person will turn out to be, Dad?

1157
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:27,083
We have to simply believe.

1158
01:28:27,916 --> 01:28:28,916
And

1159
01:28:31,583 --> 01:28:33,916
you believe in him?

1160
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:39,833
With your blessing.

1161
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:44,166
<i>In your memories</i>

1162
01:29:12,166 --> 01:29:13,166
Pras?

1163
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:23,708
-Mei?
-Pras.

1164
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:41,625
My mind is all over the place, Mei.

1165
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:44,583
I...

1166
01:29:55,458 --> 01:29:58,375
There is something
I wanted to tell you.

1167
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
That...

1168
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:09,291
That's okay.

1169
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:12,625
Akbar's nanny. Wait a minute.

1170
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:18,208
Some hot water
accidentally spilled on Akbar.

1171
01:30:18,291 --> 01:30:19,375
I have already bandaged his wounds.

1172
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:20,708
<i>He is feeling better now.</i>

1173
01:30:25,791 --> 01:30:27,458
-What?
-Akbar.

1174
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:31,375
Some hot water spilled on him.
The nanny is a little careless sometimes.

1175
01:30:31,458 --> 01:30:32,666
I have to go home.

1176
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,708
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

1177
01:30:35,791 --> 01:30:37,000
-It's okay.
-I really have to go.

1178
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:38,208
Yes, it's okay.

1179
01:30:41,666 --> 01:30:45,708
There's a very good center
for cancer treatment in Holland.

1180
01:30:45,791 --> 01:30:48,041
My friend can help.
Let's take Arini there.

1181
01:30:48,125 --> 01:30:50,750
No point, Har.
Arini doesn't want to.

1182
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:55,208
Why don’t you bring her home
to Yogya, Pras?

1183
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:58,041
I'm not sure why but
Arini still wants to be here.

1184
01:30:58,125 --> 01:31:01,916
-She still has work or something?
-I don't know!

1185
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:05,625
The only thing I can do now
is to make her happy.

1186
01:31:36,708 --> 01:31:40,125
<i>Marriage is the union of souls.</i>

1187
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:44,625
And Islam brings these souls together.

1188
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:48,583
As a sacred bond

1189
01:31:48,666 --> 01:31:52,375
to balance and protect one another.

1190
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:57,333
But my marriage was built
on someone's pain.

1191
01:31:58,791 --> 01:32:01,208
I don't wish to continue

1192
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:03,750
hurting someone else.

1193
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:08,875
You see, Meirose,

1194
01:32:10,583 --> 01:32:13,791
before you make a decision,

1195
01:32:16,083 --> 01:32:19,791
it's better to pray first.

1196
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:24,208
Because Islam

1197
01:32:24,833 --> 01:32:29,291
will provide a way out of
every problem.

1198
01:32:32,791 --> 01:32:34,666
Thank you.

1199
01:32:42,291 --> 01:32:44,083
I've decided.

1200
01:32:46,166 --> 01:32:49,083
My time is completely for you and Nadia.

1201
01:32:50,583 --> 01:32:53,458
I realize that I haven't spent
enough time with you.

1202
01:32:54,958 --> 01:32:57,166
I've been too busy with work.

1203
01:33:02,541 --> 01:33:04,958
You always take care of me.

1204
01:33:05,458 --> 01:33:07,083
Take care of Nadia.

1205
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:14,166
What do you want, Rin?

1206
01:33:32,541 --> 01:33:33,541
Honey?

1207
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:41,500
What I want from you is

1208
01:33:42,208 --> 01:33:44,875
not to divorce Mei.

1209
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,416
No.

1210
01:33:50,666 --> 01:33:53,041
I will do anything aside from that.

1211
01:33:53,916 --> 01:33:55,291
For me.

1212
01:33:55,375 --> 01:33:58,000
For Nadia.

1213
01:33:58,083 --> 01:34:00,541
Rin, you can never be replaced.

1214
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,916
It would be better
if I just live with Nadia.

1215
01:34:05,375 --> 01:34:06,375
No, honey.

1216
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:09,208
You cannot live alone.

1217
01:34:09,708 --> 01:34:12,916
I don't want that.
Nadia needs a mother.

1218
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:16,791
Nadia needs a mother.

1219
01:34:39,666 --> 01:34:41,416
Help me be a good muslim, Mei.

1220
01:35:00,083 --> 01:35:02,500
Last night, I read the Al-Quran.

1221
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:08,458
There are still so many things
I need to learn.

1222
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,666
I'm a woman.

1223
01:35:17,083 --> 01:35:19,541
You're the one who should guide me.

1224
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:23,333
Mei.

1225
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,208
You have opened my eyes.

1226
01:35:29,291 --> 01:35:31,500
I have learned a lot from you.

1227
01:35:32,375 --> 01:35:35,291
We still have a lot to learn, together.

1228
01:35:37,541 --> 01:35:39,583
I will still look to you for guidance.

1229
01:36:43,416 --> 01:36:44,416
Mei?

1230
01:36:48,416 --> 01:36:49,708
Sorry, Mei.

1231
01:36:50,208 --> 01:36:51,375
I didn't

1232
01:36:51,458 --> 01:36:54,833
call ahead to let you know
that Pras and I wanted to come here.

1233
01:36:54,916 --> 01:36:56,208
Where is Akbar's nanny?

1234
01:36:56,291 --> 01:36:58,000
She left already.

1235
01:36:59,416 --> 01:37:01,916
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

1236
01:37:05,333 --> 01:37:06,500
Akbar?

1237
01:37:07,333 --> 01:37:09,208
Let's continue drawing over there.

1238
01:37:15,791 --> 01:37:17,583
Can I talk to you?

1239
01:37:17,666 --> 01:37:19,333
Yes. Okay.

1240
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:27,291
What is it?

1241
01:37:34,916 --> 01:37:35,916
Mei.

1242
01:37:38,666 --> 01:37:40,416
For Nadia's sake.

1243
01:37:43,166 --> 01:37:45,125
And also for Akbar's.

1244
01:37:47,125 --> 01:37:48,125
What?

1245
01:37:52,375 --> 01:37:53,583
I want you

1246
01:37:56,791 --> 01:37:59,000
to take my place.

1247
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:03,541
As Nadia's mother and Pras's wife.

1248
01:38:05,541 --> 01:38:06,541
I don't understand.

1249
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,333
Please, Mei.

1250
01:38:12,375 --> 01:38:13,958
Akbar, I got you...

1251
01:38:17,916 --> 01:38:18,916
Arini?

1252
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,291
Doctor Syarief.

1253
01:38:21,833 --> 01:38:23,458
You know him?

1254
01:38:23,541 --> 01:38:24,541
-She...
-Yes.

1255
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:26,291
She's my patient.

1256
01:38:26,375 --> 01:38:28,791
The woman I told you about.

1257
01:38:31,041 --> 01:38:33,166
She is also the woman I told you about

1258
01:38:40,833 --> 01:38:42,958
So Pras is the...

1259
01:38:45,583 --> 01:38:46,583
Yes.

1260
01:38:48,791 --> 01:38:49,791
Akbar.

1261
01:38:50,125 --> 01:38:53,500
Come here. I got you a present.

1262
01:38:55,708 --> 01:38:56,958
Here you go.

1263
01:39:01,958 --> 01:39:03,416
I'm sorry, maybe...

1264
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,291
I probably shouldn't be here.

1265
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:09,083
I...

1266
01:39:09,166 --> 01:39:10,291
Goodbye.

1267
01:39:10,375 --> 01:39:11,541
Pras.

1268
01:39:11,625 --> 01:39:13,583
-Peace be with you.
-Arini!

1269
01:39:14,125 --> 01:39:15,125
Arini!

1270
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:18,208
I'm sorry, Mei. Doc.

1271
01:39:18,291 --> 01:39:19,291
Arini?

1272
01:39:28,333 --> 01:39:30,125
Akbar, please go to your room, okay?

1273
01:39:30,208 --> 01:39:31,208
-Okay?
-Yes.

1274
01:39:49,958 --> 01:39:51,833
What's wrong with Arini, Rief?

1275
01:39:58,083 --> 01:39:59,500
What's wrong?

1276
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,708
Cervical cancer stage 4.

1277
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:05,291
The cancer has spread to the brain.

1278
01:40:08,625 --> 01:40:09,791
-Mei!
-No!

1279
01:40:14,291 --> 01:40:15,291
Mei!

1280
01:40:23,833 --> 01:40:25,041
Mei!

1281
01:40:26,541 --> 01:40:28,458
Mei, listen!

1282
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:40,291
-I beg you, please.
-Mei, she refused.

1283
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:44,250
She refused everything I suggested.

1284
01:40:44,333 --> 01:40:46,291
I've done my absolute best. Okay?

1285
01:41:26,458 --> 01:41:29,041
I'm going to take some time off
after this, Rin.

1286
01:41:30,583 --> 01:41:32,500
I'll take care of you at home.

1287
01:41:33,875 --> 01:41:36,583
We will teach Nadia
to be an independent kid.

1288
01:41:36,666 --> 01:41:38,041
I'm going to learn how to cook.

1289
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:40,750
I will take care of everything,
all of Nadia's needs.

1290
01:41:41,166 --> 01:41:44,625
I will try to make you happy.

1291
01:41:49,791 --> 01:41:50,791
Honey?

1292
01:41:53,041 --> 01:41:54,041
Honey?

1293
01:41:55,166 --> 01:41:56,166
Arini?

1294
01:43:04,041 --> 01:43:07,250
Arini is going to leave us all, Mei.

1295
01:43:12,458 --> 01:43:14,000
No, Pras.

1296
01:43:18,541 --> 01:43:20,250
I have to let her go.

1297
01:43:23,333 --> 01:43:25,666
I will miss the person

1298
01:43:27,708 --> 01:43:29,875
who taught me

1299
01:43:29,958 --> 01:43:33,166
how to love with honesty.

1300
01:43:39,166 --> 01:43:40,166
No.

1301
01:43:41,583 --> 01:43:44,000
You will never lose her.

1302
01:43:52,791 --> 01:43:53,791
Pras.

1303
01:43:55,958 --> 01:43:57,791
You can see Arini now.

1304
01:44:19,291 --> 01:44:21,541
Please get better, Mom.

1305
01:45:13,083 --> 01:45:14,875
Don't give up, okay?

1306
01:45:15,583 --> 01:45:17,791
You are a strong woman,
you can beat this.

1307
01:45:33,291 --> 01:45:38,500
Keep the ring, Mei.

1308
01:45:41,708 --> 01:45:43,625
Keep the ring, okay?

1309
01:45:44,708 --> 01:45:47,000
This is your heaven.

1310
01:45:52,458 --> 01:45:53,458
Mei.

1311
01:46:01,166 --> 01:46:02,166
Pras.

1312
01:46:09,916 --> 01:46:11,333
What is it, honey?

1313
01:46:14,291 --> 01:46:19,541
I would like us to pray together.

1314
01:46:26,083 --> 01:46:28,916
Arini wants to pray together, Doctor.

1315
01:46:29,625 --> 01:46:31,125
I'll make the arrangements.

1316
01:50:49,875 --> 01:50:51,958
I would like to go the mosque, my love.

1317
01:50:52,208 --> 01:50:54,333
I want to tell stories to the children.

1318
01:50:55,041 --> 01:50:56,250
Yes, my love.

1319
01:50:56,833 --> 01:50:59,208
I hope that gives you field of kindness.

1320
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,125
And becomes your heaven.

1321
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:03,791
-Amen.
-Amen.

1322
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:06,916
Miss Arini! Come on!

1323
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,416
Come on, Miss Arini! Come on!

1324
01:51:10,083 --> 01:51:11,458
They are here for me.

1325
01:51:11,541 --> 01:51:12,541
I have to go.

1326
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:14,583
Yes.

1327
01:51:18,208 --> 01:51:21,250
-Peace be with you.
-Peace be with you.

1328
01:51:47,708 --> 01:51:49,166
Thank you.

1329
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:52,125
No, it should be me
saying thank you.

1330
01:52:07,458 --> 01:52:11,583
<i>I would like to deliver</i>

1331
01:52:11,666 --> 01:52:16,375
<i>A last message to you</i>

1332
01:52:16,458 --> 01:52:23,458
<i>Before I close this love story of ours</i>

1333
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:29,250

1334
01:52:29,333 --> 01:52:34,041

1335
01:52:34,125 --> 01:52:37,375
<i>That tells the tale</i>

1336
01:52:37,458 --> 01:52:41,375
<i>Of the course of our love</i>

1337
01:52:41,458 --> 01:52:45,458

1338
01:52:45,541 --> 01:52:49,583

<i>But don't let this life end</i>

1340
01:52:52,208 --> 01:52:54,041
Thank you, Uncle Syarief.

1341
01:52:54,125 --> 01:52:56,875
You made my mom's wish come true.

1342
01:52:57,875 --> 01:53:02,166
To mourn the loss of Ms. Arini.

1343
01:53:03,666 --> 01:53:05,583
Wa are gathered here today

1344
01:53:05,666 --> 01:53:10,291
to celebrate the marriage of
Pras and Meirose.

1345
01:53:11,416 --> 01:53:12,916
A gift from Arini.

1346
01:53:15,583 --> 01:53:17,458
Arini wrote all my secrets here.

1347
01:53:22,125 --> 01:53:23,916
I will read it carefully.

1348
01:53:28,291 --> 01:53:31,208
-Dad. Mom.
-Nadia. Akbar.

1349
01:53:32,708 --> 01:53:35,041
What are you guys doing?

1350
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:39,458
-Have you eaten?
-Yes.

1351
01:53:41,916 --> 01:53:48,791
