1
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:33,200
On the powerful docks of the Wrexham company...

2
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,020
... war and trading vessels are built...

3
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,720
...machines being built and being taken apart...

4
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:08,320
Lord John Bellamont can't deny that just 25 years ago he was just dockworker, John Wrexham...

5
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,800
... with regards to his son Philipp, he was used to leading the life of luxury.

6
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
You will miss me, Philipp, if you go back to Oxford tomorrow.

7
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:39,120
Don't you want to spend as long as possible with me today?

8
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I can't, Vicky, I still have to say goodbye to my father.

9
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Who is that with Philipp?

10
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,520
Don't you know Vicky?

11
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:18,520
Her official title is Lady Victoria Burlington, daughter of the Duke of Dover.

12
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,080
We actually lead a pointless existence - Dance, Jazz and Sparkling Wine serve no purpose in life.

13
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Wake up, sleepy head! We want to liven this place up!

14
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Let's go now, Philipp, and I'll drive with you to the shipyard, to meet your father.

15
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,920
I made a decent offer to the people.

16
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:11,420
If the staff reject the proposal, I shall lock the whole lot of them out!

17
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,880
That's O'Neil, he has a wife and child.

18
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Is the wife of Michael O'Neil, here?

19
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,840
Let the insurance company know about the accident and give the widow Â£500 from my cash drawer.

20
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Your son and Lady Victoria are in the shipyard - they will be here soon.

21
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I regret the misfortune most sincerely. I have made provision for the family accordingly.

22
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,160
A submarine? Are some ships to be sunk?

23
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,740
Yes ! - The ships of other fleets.

24
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,440
Here, spend the money at Oxford, show them that you are the wealthy son of old Wrexham!

25
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,480
This is your last term, in the Autumn you will become my partner.

26
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,480
There's Lady Bellmont with her latest suitor -

27
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:37,480
a scandal, how the woman behaves - she has an adult son!

28
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,920
Isn't that your mother?

29
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,680
I see my mother so rarely, that I hardly recognise her anymore!

30
00:17:09,315 --> 00:17:12,315
Well - if it isnt my son, Philipp?

31
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:57,600
If you don't want to drive me to the Legation Ball, Philipp, then take me home now.

32
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,400
The old University city, Oxford...

33
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,320
... where the rich sons of England study, work and play sport...

34
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,080
I have acquired a house in the city, which is like a Hotel, and want...

35
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,840
Haven't you heard the news?
Philipp Wrexham suddenly became pious - 

36
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,060
imagine that, after his earlier mad life!

37
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,800
To inaugurate our Palace - The Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor and the first Lord of the Admiralty

38
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:32,270
have confirmed their attendance. I wish that you, being my intended associate, will fulfill your representational duties.

39
00:20:32,271 --> 00:20:36,730
The Dinner will start at 9 o'clock. 
Your loving, father.

40
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Do you want to come to the tennis court?

41
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,800
We need real men for our work, hard workers, undemanding tireless fighters.

42
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:39,760
I am your servant! - This proud phrase that a German prince could transform the World into a Paradise...

43
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:53,720
...if only people were to take this seriously.
But ambition, greed and lust for power
destroy any hope for happiness.

44
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:18,840
God? God gave us the best will, to love 
and make our fellow men happy!

45
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,280
That really came from the heart.

46
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Can I count on your co-operation?

47
00:26:28,115 --> 00:26:35,115
Why haven't you changed yet? Our
guests will be here soon.

48
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,760
Leave me with your records in peace -
they're even more warped than you!

49
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,840
... fine, I will be there. After all I
have to dine somewhere.

50
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,440
Why don't you take off that piece of sheet
metal from around your neck?

51
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:38,700
You make yourself look ridiculous 
with your exotic medals.

52
00:28:58,365 --> 00:29:02,365
Actually, I didn't want you at all. I was 
looking for Philipp.

53
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,280
I summoned him here urgently. Do you know
for sure whether he is in London?

54
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Do you think that he may have had
a car accident?

55
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,440
My lord, the guests are becoming impatient.

56
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,350
... very well, let them serve Dinner.

57
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,960
A telegram, my lord.

58
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,200
I am Lord Bellamont. Where is my son?

59
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,920
What is this masquerade? Pull yourself
together and come home!

60
00:34:12,155 --> 00:34:16,155
Your son is looking for peace with us - 
let him find it!

61
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,040
And what becomes of me, and my business?
Don't you think you have obligations to me - 
your father?

62
00:34:57,715 --> 00:35:04,715
I despise the world of your business with 
its greed, finances and over-indulgence...

63
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,160
No, father, my decision is made.

64
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:47,320
You are a fool, if you are to let yourself
be talked round by him.

65
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:52,735
The Three Passions
Fifth Act

66
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,160
My God! What could have happened?

67
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Worse than suicide - he wants to become a priest!

68
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,640
Thank God, then everything is alright!

69
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,460
He will still, given time, realise that he belongs
and has a free life...

70
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,840
... and then the passion will overcome him,
it will be stronger than his faith...

71
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
... the Love !

72
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:26,160
If you are able to straighten his head out,
you can ask of me, whatever you want.

73
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
If I can get him back, I don't know what 
else I could still possibly wish for!

74
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
In the Seamen's Mission

75
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:33,715
For three days I haven't eaten anything,
dear Lady.

76
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,160
I don't want Vicky to stay here.

77
00:43:57,586 --> 00:44:00,000
Can you write?

78
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,280
Philipp will not hold out. Today he
almost kissed me!

79
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,600
Difficult days followed for old Lord Bellamont.
No word from Philipp - A strike at the Shipyard...

80
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:04,560
I have one more chance - I still have
night duty at the Seamen's Mission.

81
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,160
His work means more to him than Love.

82
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,640
They don't know how wealthy he is, I'm glad 
that I can help him.

83
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,880
I shall wipe my hands of him - I shall also
cope without you.

84
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,160
You must do the night duty alone tonight.

85
00:51:21,235 --> 00:51:25,235
'scuse me, lady - it's just a force of habit!

86
00:51:27,715 --> 00:51:30,715
...is everything in my hat, lady!

87
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,480
If you come out, you can surely be a
little bit nice!

88
00:55:15,235 --> 00:55:21,235
Son fights at the Wrexham Shipyard.
Lord Bellamont rejects arbitral award.
8000 workers locked out.

89
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:28,480
Lord Bellamont is very sick. A nervous breakdown
is confirmed. The disturbances, which are 

90
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,960
Telephone my son - quick!

91
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:50,640
Hurry, for God sake hurry! Young sir, 
your father is dieing.

92
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:47,960
Get the people back in again - the work starts up again...

93
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,920
Your demands are met, if you will agree
to immediately start work again!

94
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,920
This is your place, Philipp - yours and
Vicky's - the workers need you!
