1
00:01:31,254 --> 00:01:32,506
- Shut up!
- No!

2
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:34,717
We got it, we got it. We got it, here.

3
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,758
- Please, please, please.
- Look, look.

4
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:39,929
- That's nice.
- Good, we're good. We're good.

5
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:41,682
Don't!

6
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,854
You fuck.

7
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:25,243
Come on, Maggie.

8
00:03:34,877 --> 00:03:37,004
Are you the one causing all the trouble?

9
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:53,104
Lee!

10
00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:56,106
Lee! Lee!

11
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:00,862
- Breathe, breathe, honey.
- Okay.

12
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:02,778
You're gonna be fine. Breathe.

13
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:04,532
- Drink.
- Thank you.

14
00:04:04,614 --> 00:04:06,284
It's oxygen for you.

15
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:08,827
This is crazy weather.

16
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,497
- Okay, you're gonna be fine.
- Oh, God.

17
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:15,667
- Gonna be fine.
- I thought I had it under control.

18
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:20,422
Yeah, well, that's what I said
about my second marriage,

19
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:22,591
and look at me.

20
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:29,598
I thought you quit.

21
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:33,934
If Pilar asks, I did.

22
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:36,479
- I'll have to remember that.
- Mm-hmm.

23
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:53,913
I thought you were scared of heights.

24
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,709
I'm claustrophobic, Lee.

25
00:04:57,792 --> 00:04:59,502
I'm not afraid of heights.

26
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:03,756
Hell, the only thing
I'm scared of is my wife.

27
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:27,114
What is going on, Lee?
You told me you'd be done.

28
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:30,366
- I'll fix it. I'll fix it.
- How? How are you gonna fix it?

29
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,953
I'll talk to her. No problem.

30
00:05:33,036 --> 00:05:36,540
Hey, that's my locker.
You can't just go through my stuff.

31
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:38,040
Maggie, I got this.

32
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41,128
It's not your stuff. Not anymore.

33
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,087
My deal's with Lee, not with you.

34
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:47,341
Well, what does Lee have to do with this?
You don't pay, you can't stay. Period.

35
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:50,262
Maggie, listen. Maybe we can give him

36
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:52,471
- another month, okay?
- Yeah.

37
00:05:52,556 --> 00:05:54,515
- I already put it in the system.
- I know.

38
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:56,226
You can't take it off the block.

39
00:05:56,892 --> 00:06:00,937
I'm not moving till she puts my lock
back on this locker.

40
00:06:02,732 --> 00:06:04,567
Lee, what the fuck?

41
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:07,123
- You said you were gonna fix it.
- I will.

42
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:09,698
- Show me. Fix it. Do something.
- Hey, please.

43
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:13,993
- I'll buy you a beer and we'll talk.
- Buy me a beer?

44
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:15,077
Yes.

45
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:17,121
She could use a beer.

46
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:19,622
- I know.
- Not me.

47
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:37,433
I got you this.

48
00:06:37,516 --> 00:06:38,560
What the hell's that?

49
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:40,935
- Something for your wall.
- Where'd you get it?

50
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:43,731
No, thanks.

51
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:48,944
- Are you angry?
- Nope.

52
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:50,696
You did what you had to do. Right?

53
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,906
Then why don't you take the trout?

54
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,575
It's a bass, not a trout.

55
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:56,285
I know. I was just testing you.

56
00:06:59,623 --> 00:07:01,372
Is Pilar coming to get you?

57
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:04,169
Yes. She's coming. Any minute.

58
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,836
Are you going to the park for lunch?

59
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:09,005
Yup.

60
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:11,800
Do you want me
to close out Harris's account?

61
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:14,888
You should be the one getting credit
from corporate.

62
00:07:15,553 --> 00:07:17,514
- Credit?
- Sure. He's your customer.

63
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:23,772
Maggie, we just stole the man's things.

64
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:26,315
You shouldn't gloat.

65
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:31,361
Hi.

66
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:50,131
You don't pay, you can't stay.

67
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:31,624
Not another one.

68
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:14,290
What the heck?

69
00:11:16,668 --> 00:11:17,668
Maggie?

70
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,130
Lee.

71
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:22,298
The light was blinking.

72
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:24,134
- I thought maybe it...
- Go home.

73
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:25,510
I'll lock it up.

74
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:29,306
Whose locker is this?

75
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,016
It's for a friend, off the books.

76
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:36,356
You aren't going to report me, are you?

77
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:40,650
No. No, of course not.

78
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:43,027
Go home.

79
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:56,582
Philadelphia police are still
investigating a diamond heist

80
00:11:56,667 --> 00:12:00,462
that left one woman dead last week
in the famed jewelry district.

81
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:02,964
The two thieves are considered
armed and dangerous.

82
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:04,549
So, how much did they get?

83
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:06,677
Official numbers not immediately released,

84
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,930
but some police sources say
the number could be in the millions.

85
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,519
Come on. You better be
on your phone this time.

86
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:22,901
Your service is temporarily disconnected.

87
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:25,529
- For further assistance, please call...
- Damn it!

88
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,622
What are you doing?

89
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:19,123
Happy birthday.

90
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:21,708
Blow out your candle.

91
00:13:22,628 --> 00:13:24,046
I can't believe you.

92
00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:29,384
I know it's not till tomorrow
but I just thought, why not?

93
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:32,844
Why are you spending money on presents?

94
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:35,263
We need that money for real food.

95
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:38,100
It's… It's my money.

96
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:40,602
Your money?
Where are you getting money from?

97
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,106
- I got a job.
- Really?

98
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:47,110
Teacher's assistant after school.

99
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,529
- Since when?
- Just... Whatever, Mom. It's for you.

100
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:58,620
Yeah, well, the rent's not due
for another ten days.

101
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,873
Freddy said he's gonna come by later.

102
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:02,332
Such a vagina.

103
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,584
Tarin.

104
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:06,837
Daddy used to say it all the time.

105
00:14:09,257 --> 00:14:11,802
- Here, try some. It's really good.
- No, I don't want any.

106
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,484
- Mom, just try some.
- I don't want any!

107
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:16,888
- You hate everything.
- No.

108
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:18,098
- Yeah, you do.
- I've…

109
00:14:46,043 --> 00:14:47,711
Hey, Freddy.

110
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,254
Look, I didn't wanna bother ya

111
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:51,964
'cause I know how hard
it's been since Rich left.

112
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,135
He didn't leave, Freddy. He went to jail.

113
00:14:55,219 --> 00:14:57,930
- I need the two months, by tomorrow.
- What are you talking about?

114
00:14:58,013 --> 00:14:59,222
I just paid you.

115
00:14:59,307 --> 00:15:02,435
Your last check bounced.
I can't cover for ya anymore.

116
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,605
Well, how am I supposed to get
two months' rent?

117
00:15:07,397 --> 00:15:10,151
Tomorrow or I gotta ask you to leave.
Sorry.

118
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:13,527
Freddy, please. Can...

119
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:18,201
Can you just give me
till next week to figure this out?

120
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:22,205
Please?

121
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,541
Freddy, you gotta help me out.
I'm begging you.

122
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:32,506
Well, maybe there's
an arrangement we can come to.

123
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:35,927
- Come on, Freddy. I'm married.
- Not from where I stand.

124
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:40,055
I'd rather sleep in my car.

125
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:42,724
You may have to.

126
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,435
- Mom?
- Yeah?

127
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,852
Is everything okay?

128
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:50,191
You got a beautiful daughter.

129
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,276
God. Come on.

130
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:04,537
Are we gonna have to move out?

131
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:08,166
Why would you say that?

132
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:11,379
I heard Freddy say
we're gonna have to move into our car.

133
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,672
Come here.

134
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:18,759
What do I always say?

135
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:22,597
- That only God can make us do anything?
- That's right.

136
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:27,936
So did God make Dad go away?

137
00:16:28,018 --> 00:16:29,770
Dad made Dad go away.

138
00:16:29,854 --> 00:16:31,647
That is not how I remember it.

139
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:36,193
I'm not having this conversation
with you again, Tarin.

140
00:16:36,277 --> 00:16:38,279
Come here. Read.

141
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:48,415
"Men do not despise a thief if he steals
to satisfy his soul when he is hungry."

142
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:52,335
But if he be found,
he shall restore sevenfold.

143
00:16:52,418 --> 00:16:54,795
"He shall give all the substance
of his house."

144
00:16:56,381 --> 00:16:58,216
What does sevenfold mean?

145
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:15,817
Tarin. Shoelaces.

146
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,443
- I'm driving.
- No, no, no!

147
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:18,944
No way! Give me that back.

148
00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:20,738
Mom, don't be such a vagina. Come on.

149
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:22,364
What did you just call me?

150
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,744
Okay, I'm sorry.
Happy birthday. Can I drive?

151
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:28,788
What if you get
into an accident or something?

152
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:30,916
Well, how am I gonna learn
how to drive, Mom?

153
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:35,544
Mom, come on, let's go. Mom!

154
00:18:07,993 --> 00:18:10,996
- What are we doing here?
- Just stay here. I'll be right back.

155
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:12,415
Okay.

156
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,444
What am I doing?

157
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:34,246
Oh, my God. Lee!

158
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,878
Hello? Hello?

159
00:19:45,006 --> 00:19:46,342
Oh, my God.

160
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:05,694
- Hey.
- Turn that off!

161
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:09,489
- Geez. Turn that off!
- What? God! Fuck.

162
00:20:11,282 --> 00:20:13,868
- What's wrong?
- Something happened to my boss.

163
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:15,537
I think he may be hurt.

164
00:20:22,836 --> 00:20:24,212
Your service is temporarily...

165
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:26,422
- Shit!
- Did you just curse?

166
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:30,301
- Do as I say, not as I do, Tarin.
- Great, Mom.

167
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:34,265
All right, just stay in here
and keep the doors locked, okay?

168
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:38,560
- Okay. Wait, you're taking the keys?
- Yes.

169
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:40,477
I'm driving when I come home.

170
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:16,556
Please, just let me go,
and tomorrow I'll get your money.

171
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:19,684
We can't wait anymore.
Now, we need our money tonight.

172
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:21,769
You think I'm stupid, huh?

173
00:21:22,896 --> 00:21:28,943
Are you nuts? Are you crazy?
Every cop in Philly is looking for you!

174
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:30,944
I don't give a shit. It has to be tonight.

175
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:33,405
You saw it in the news
and you thought we'd blow town,

176
00:21:33,489 --> 00:21:35,365
that you could keep our money?

177
00:21:36,283 --> 00:21:38,370
Tonight, Lee. Tonight.

178
00:21:38,452 --> 00:21:40,871
- No more waiting.
- Okay.

179
00:21:40,955 --> 00:21:43,458
You go get our money
and put it in two bags

180
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,627
- like we asked.
- Please, you gotta believe me.

181
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,544
I don't... I don't have your money.

182
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:49,839
- I don't...
- We want the diamonds.

183
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:56,010
- Yeah, you see...
- The woman you killed, she had a family…

184
00:21:56,095 --> 00:21:58,097
- So what?
- So what!

185
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,682
It means you guys got
a bounty on your head.

186
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:04,520
No fence in town will touch your property,

187
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:07,564
so settle the fuck down.

188
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:09,525
They're in one of these lockers,
aren't they?

189
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:14,197
Yeah. I already told you,
your property is safe.

190
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:16,614
What happened to you, man?
I fucking looked up to you.

191
00:22:16,698 --> 00:22:19,952
- Look at you now! You're a fucking mess!
- I should say that to you!

192
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:24,833
You… You really spoke to the cops, Lee?

193
00:22:24,915 --> 00:22:27,502
- You spoke to the fucking cops?
- What? What?

194
00:22:29,838 --> 00:22:31,046
Hey, don't!

195
00:22:34,676 --> 00:22:38,345
Lee! Fuck, man!
Why did you do that? Hey! Hey!

196
00:22:40,472 --> 00:22:41,472
Hey! Hey!

197
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:44,561
Lee! Lee!

198
00:22:48,438 --> 00:22:50,733
- Fuck! We're fucked now, man!
- Yeah.

199
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:53,443
Who are we gonna get…
How are we gonna get the diamonds?

200
00:22:55,988 --> 00:22:58,322
Fuck! Look, look! Man, look!

201
00:22:58,408 --> 00:22:59,908
We got a fucking bigger problem now.

202
00:23:04,662 --> 00:23:06,957
Fuck, let's take him in...
Let's put him inside.

203
00:23:29,812 --> 00:23:31,064
Tarin.

204
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:34,901
Tarin!

205
00:23:37,236 --> 00:23:40,407
Tarin! Oh, my God…

206
00:23:40,491 --> 00:23:43,452
Damn it. Where is she?

207
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,206
- Tarin.
- I'm in here.

208
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:49,666
Tarin. Oh, my God.

209
00:23:49,749 --> 00:23:51,959
- Tarin. Tarin.
- I'm in here.

210
00:23:52,043 --> 00:23:54,170
- Tarin.
- In here.

211
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:57,131
Tarin. Open the door.

212
00:23:57,216 --> 00:23:59,342
I'm on the toilet! Weirdo.

213
00:24:00,427 --> 00:24:04,680
- Open this door right now.
- I can't. It's literally like, coming out.

214
00:24:06,265 --> 00:24:08,811
- Please, open the door.
- Mom!

215
00:24:11,187 --> 00:24:12,312
What is that?

216
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:32,208
- Tarin, stay in there, okay?
- Okay.

217
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:35,043
- Keep the door locked. Don't say anything.
- Okay!

218
00:25:26,053 --> 00:25:27,054
Oh, God!

219
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:33,101
Sorry, I thought you were Lee.

220
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,481
We… We're friends of his.

221
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:40,151
What are you doing here?

222
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:44,156
He gave us access to our locker,
just for the night.

223
00:25:44,237 --> 00:25:45,489
He shouldn't have done that.

224
00:25:45,573 --> 00:25:48,325
Yeah, well, like I said,
we're close friends.

225
00:25:48,408 --> 00:25:50,244
You work here?

226
00:25:51,162 --> 00:25:52,454
Yes.

227
00:25:53,457 --> 00:25:56,958
I'm Margaret,
but everyone calls me Maggie.

228
00:25:57,878 --> 00:26:03,340
- Can I offer you some coffee?
- Sure. Mel, coffee?

229
00:26:09,303 --> 00:26:11,932
I can get you a clean one.

230
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:13,433
That'll be good.

231
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,982
Do you want… cream or sugar?

232
00:26:20,065 --> 00:26:24,069
Lots of sugar. What kind is it?

233
00:26:24,152 --> 00:26:26,405
- Kind?
- Yeah…

234
00:26:26,488 --> 00:26:30,117
Costa Rican, Brazilian, Kenyan, what?

235
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,326
It's American, I think.

236
00:26:33,705 --> 00:26:36,249
Where… Where are you from?

237
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:40,211
I live about a half hour away.

238
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:42,169
No, I mean, "Where are you from?"

239
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:47,926
A small town in Florida.
You probably never heard of it.

240
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,053
What, Disney World?

241
00:26:51,848 --> 00:26:54,267
- Lakeland.
- I know it.

242
00:26:55,976 --> 00:26:58,019
Well, not many people do.

243
00:26:58,103 --> 00:27:02,232
I grew up north of Tallahassee.
My old man was a truck driver.

244
00:27:03,443 --> 00:27:06,903
My stepdad was a truck driver.
Maybe they knew each other.

245
00:27:06,987 --> 00:27:08,989
Well, I could care less who he knew.

246
00:27:09,071 --> 00:27:11,198
My old man was a piece of shit.

247
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,751
- Sorry, is it too much sugar?
- Tastes like dookie.

248
00:27:22,668 --> 00:27:24,421
Sorry, Lee bought it.

249
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:30,552
I see his taste in art
is the same as his coffee.

250
00:27:34,306 --> 00:27:36,057
It's got its charm.

251
00:27:39,185 --> 00:27:41,606
- Maggie, right?
- Uh-huh.

252
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:46,692
Look, Lee hasn't been
really helpful with us lately.

253
00:27:46,776 --> 00:27:50,279
You know how he can be
a stubborn old geezer.

254
00:27:51,573 --> 00:27:53,074
I don't follow.

255
00:27:53,824 --> 00:27:55,493
What I'm saying is,

256
00:27:56,953 --> 00:28:00,248
I think we can help each other out.

257
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:02,877
In what way?

258
00:28:05,128 --> 00:28:08,423
Lee and I, we made a deal, off the books.

259
00:28:09,508 --> 00:28:10,717
Okay.

260
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:13,762
I need something
that he kept for us in a locker.

261
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:16,014
The only thing is,
I don't know which locker.

262
00:28:16,098 --> 00:28:18,474
And I don't wanna bother
the old man again.

263
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,977
What do you want me to do?

264
00:28:22,061 --> 00:28:23,647
Help us find the locker.

265
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:29,194
You do, and the $2,000
in my pocket is yours.

266
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:33,699
- What is the name on the locker?
- Lee Fenton.

267
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:37,828
I could get fired if Lee finds out.

268
00:28:40,371 --> 00:28:42,289
You want it, or not?

269
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,175
Come on.

270
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:55,845
Where are you going?

271
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,184
Stop!

272
00:29:05,937 --> 00:29:08,189
Hold it. Hold it! Stop.

273
00:29:18,908 --> 00:29:20,829
Who was in the bathroom?

274
00:29:22,954 --> 00:29:24,622
He asked you a question.

275
00:29:24,707 --> 00:29:26,624
There's no one.

276
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,462
There's nobody here but me.

277
00:29:31,464 --> 00:29:34,051
Let her go, Mel. Let her go. Let her go.

278
00:29:34,134 --> 00:29:35,469
Let her go.

279
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:45,020
What?

280
00:29:46,187 --> 00:29:47,687
Pick her up.

281
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:38,947
Let me out of here!

282
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:49,374
Let me go! Let me go!

283
00:30:49,457 --> 00:30:50,458
Calm down.

284
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:52,837
I get... I get panic attacks.

285
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:56,172
- Calm the fuck down, lady.
- I can't be inside a space that small.

286
00:30:56,257 --> 00:30:59,135
- Please, please, please.
- You claustrophobic?

287
00:30:59,217 --> 00:31:01,010
- Yes.
- Let her go. Let her go.

288
00:31:01,095 --> 00:31:03,389
- Let me go. Let me go.
- Let her go.

289
00:31:04,473 --> 00:31:05,849
Breathe.

290
00:31:07,017 --> 00:31:10,521
- Just breathe.
- Oh, my God!

291
00:31:10,604 --> 00:31:14,065
Sorry about that.
We had no other place to put him.

292
00:31:17,068 --> 00:31:18,904
Why did you kill him?

293
00:31:18,988 --> 00:31:21,824
- He lied to me.
- To us.

294
00:31:21,906 --> 00:31:25,578
See, Lee was a scumbag
that pretended not to be one.

295
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,540
For me, that's worse than
admitting who you are and accepting it.

296
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:34,376
Are you gonna do something to me?

297
00:31:36,588 --> 00:31:38,798
Look at it this way, Maggie.

298
00:31:38,883 --> 00:31:42,428
You either help us out, or you can go back
to playing house with Lee, there.

299
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,677
It's up to you.

300
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:46,598
You see…

301
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:49,641
the lockers are empty.

302
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:57,525
Maybe what you want isn't here.

303
00:31:59,194 --> 00:32:01,446
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

304
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:06,451
We're not leaving here
until we get what we want.

305
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:07,911
You understand?

306
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,829
Let's walk.

307
00:32:25,928 --> 00:32:29,182
I can't find any other locker
registered to Lee.

308
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:31,893
- Those are the only two.
- We don't have all night.

309
00:32:31,975 --> 00:32:34,395
Lee had to have had
another locker besides 206.

310
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,231
This is a waste of time.
She can't help us.

311
00:32:38,775 --> 00:32:40,943
If you can do better,
then why don't you do it?

312
00:32:43,196 --> 00:32:44,655
Your husband put up with that lip?

313
00:32:46,449 --> 00:32:48,118
My husband doesn't live with us.

314
00:32:50,453 --> 00:32:51,453
Us?

315
00:32:52,747 --> 00:32:53,873
My daughter.

316
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,297
She's very young. If I don't
get home soon, she gets scared.

317
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:03,883
- She knows you're here?
- Yes.

318
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:05,968
This is bullshit!

319
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:10,848
Calm down, Mel, calm down.

320
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:11,974
Okay.

321
00:33:13,143 --> 00:33:14,226
Talk.

322
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:16,937
There was another name.

323
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:20,733
I didn't think anything of it,
but Lee inputted it this week.

324
00:33:20,817 --> 00:33:22,277
So what?

325
00:33:23,652 --> 00:33:27,281
So I'm usually the one who does that
because he hates computers.

326
00:33:27,364 --> 00:33:28,365
What's the name?

327
00:33:29,491 --> 00:33:30,534
Harris.

328
00:33:50,636 --> 00:33:51,889
Keys.

329
00:33:52,891 --> 00:33:54,224
What?

330
00:33:54,308 --> 00:33:56,644
Give me your fucking car keys.

331
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,271
- Why?
- We need your car, Maggie.

332
00:34:00,356 --> 00:34:03,859
Can't have cars in the parking lot.
Too suspicious.

333
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:05,612
Don't make me ask again.

334
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,536
You control her or I will.

335
00:34:52,365 --> 00:34:55,284
So, your husband leave you
for another woman? Nope!

336
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,205
That's not it
'cause you still got that ring.

337
00:34:57,286 --> 00:34:58,955
Can I get something from my car first?

338
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:01,750
Wait, I got it.
He left you for the babysitter.

339
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,961
Only thing is, she's your younger sister.

340
00:35:05,045 --> 00:35:06,755
No?

341
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,674
Please, I need to get to my car.

342
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:11,592
What is it, your purse?

343
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:15,055
- Mel's not the thief. I'm the thief.
- No, it's not my purse.

344
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:18,599
Whatever it is, it can wait.
I wanna know more about your husband.

345
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:22,062
I'm not telling you
anything else about my life.

346
00:35:22,146 --> 00:35:24,273
Why, 'cause it's so goddamn boring?

347
00:35:29,651 --> 00:35:34,282
- You remind me of my husband.
- How is that?

348
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:37,369
He used to joke like you all the time,
and then he got caught.

349
00:35:39,038 --> 00:35:40,329
This is it.

350
00:35:40,414 --> 00:35:44,877
- So, he… he's in prison, huh?
- Yes.

351
00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:51,759
How old is your kid?

352
00:35:54,676 --> 00:35:56,054
Seventeen.

353
00:35:57,514 --> 00:35:59,141
I always wanted kids.

354
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:04,354
I don't like this place.
It reminds me of prison.

355
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,356
What were you in prison for?

356
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,068
Armed robbery, assault,
whatever came my way.

357
00:36:10,942 --> 00:36:13,905
- What about your husband?
- Armed robbery.

358
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:18,326
So, why'd you marry him?

359
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:21,245
- I'm sorry?
- Come on.

360
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:23,081
I'm not the first person to bring it up.

361
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,586
You're more likely
to be his mom than his girl.

362
00:36:28,669 --> 00:36:30,463
What is that supposed to mean?

363
00:36:30,546 --> 00:36:32,422
Look at you. You're like a goody two-shoe.

364
00:36:32,507 --> 00:36:34,258
What are you doing with a bad boy?

365
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,224
I thought you were a thief.
What's taking you so long?

366
00:36:41,306 --> 00:36:44,435
I'm working on it.
Now you're sounding more like my old lady.

367
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,940
My husband, Rich, saved me.

368
00:36:51,024 --> 00:36:53,026
What, you were drowning?

369
00:36:54,362 --> 00:36:56,279
Let's just say, no one's perfect.

370
00:36:57,406 --> 00:37:00,033
So then what, you tried to change him?

371
00:37:02,204 --> 00:37:05,623
He married me when I got pregnant.
He didn't have to.

372
00:37:07,668 --> 00:37:11,088
If he was such a good guy,
why is he in prison?

373
00:37:12,505 --> 00:37:14,464
We were happy.

374
00:37:14,549 --> 00:37:16,259
That wasn't good enough for him.

375
00:37:22,348 --> 00:37:24,058
Once a crook, always a crook.

376
00:38:02,305 --> 00:38:03,806
Fucking slobs.

377
00:38:22,407 --> 00:38:23,868
Okay.

378
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,872
What are we looking for?

379
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:29,831
None of your business.

380
00:38:30,582 --> 00:38:34,169
Well, if you tell me what it is,
I can find it quicker. Is it money?

381
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:35,420
No.

382
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,130
Then what is it?

383
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,801
Just keep pulling stuff out, will you?

384
00:38:41,842 --> 00:38:44,054
We both want the same thing, Ross.

385
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,973
- What's that?
- For you to leave.

386
00:38:49,185 --> 00:38:51,269
- You want us out?
- Yes.

387
00:38:52,647 --> 00:38:55,650
There's 200 uncut diamonds
in a black velvet pouch.

388
00:38:55,731 --> 00:38:58,902
You help me find that pouch,
I'll give you Lee's cut.

389
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,822
I don't want anything from you.
I just want you gone.

390
00:39:02,906 --> 00:39:05,785
No one's a saint, Maggie, not even you.

391
00:39:05,867 --> 00:39:08,078
Well, at least I can sleep at night.

392
00:39:08,161 --> 00:39:11,748
What'd you say? What'd you say?
What'd you say? What'd you say?

393
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:14,166
Listen. I ain't a killer.

394
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:16,545
But someone crosses me,
they get what's coming.

395
00:39:16,628 --> 00:39:18,004
And I sleep just fine.

396
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,589
You hear me? Just fine.

397
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,168
Ross.

398
00:39:57,793 --> 00:39:58,960
Ross.

399
00:40:00,463 --> 00:40:02,048
What's the holdup?

400
00:40:04,842 --> 00:40:06,219
It's not here.

401
00:40:07,387 --> 00:40:09,890
- I can't hear you.
- It's not here!

402
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:13,059
You gotta press the button.
The black thing.

403
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:17,606
It's... It's not here.

404
00:40:17,687 --> 00:40:21,192
- It's gotta be.
- We've looked, man.

405
00:40:21,943 --> 00:40:24,653
- Did you move her car?
- Yeah.

406
00:40:24,737 --> 00:40:26,614
Lock it up on your floor and get up here.

407
00:40:27,573 --> 00:40:29,492
What about the video cameras?

408
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:34,580
- How do we delete the tapes?
- There's no tapes.

409
00:40:35,624 --> 00:40:40,921
It's a remote system. It sends a signal
to the database off-site.

410
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:44,965
- So there's no way to delete the footage?
- No, not that I know of.

411
00:40:46,424 --> 00:40:47,469
Fuck it.

412
00:40:47,551 --> 00:40:50,304
We'll be gone before it matters.
Get up here.

413
00:41:35,598 --> 00:41:37,183
Can I help you, Officer?

414
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:48,029
Maybe he had another locker.

415
00:41:48,112 --> 00:41:49,530
I doubt it.

416
00:41:50,532 --> 00:41:52,616
Where the fuck is Mel? I need a knife.

417
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:57,495
- For what?
- Open this thing up.

418
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,040
Here we go.

419
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:04,169
You think he put it in a boxing bag?

420
00:42:04,253 --> 00:42:06,004
You have a better idea?

421
00:42:06,087 --> 00:42:09,716
- No, not really.
- Doesn't work.

422
00:42:14,221 --> 00:42:15,431
Fuck!

423
00:42:22,855 --> 00:42:25,440
Lee seem like the outdoors type to you?

424
00:42:26,524 --> 00:42:29,402
I wish you would stop talking about him
like he's still alive.

425
00:42:32,906 --> 00:42:34,616
I didn't think so, either.

426
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,831
Why would someone using
a fake name to rent a locker

427
00:42:41,915 --> 00:42:43,235
put that name on shit he's got...

428
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:05,146
Cold out there tonight, huh?

429
00:43:07,482 --> 00:43:08,608
Mm-hmm.

430
00:43:14,656 --> 00:43:17,660
- You have ID?
- Yeah. Right here.

431
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:30,630
How long you been on the force?

432
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:34,633
- Two years.
- Two years.

433
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,180
I just wanna say
I'm a big supporter of the police.

434
00:43:40,265 --> 00:43:44,017
I appreciate
all the hard work you guys do.

435
00:43:46,019 --> 00:43:48,355
- Yeah, well, it's a job.
- Yeah.

436
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:54,778
How come you don't travel in two?
I thought there was always two of ya?

437
00:43:54,863 --> 00:43:56,115
Sometimes.

438
00:43:57,448 --> 00:43:59,575
Want some coffee? I got some coffee.

439
00:44:03,787 --> 00:44:06,498
- No, I don't drink the stuff.
- No?

440
00:44:06,582 --> 00:44:09,376
- First cop I ever met don't like coffee.
- Yeah?

441
00:44:09,461 --> 00:44:11,296
You should ask me if I want a doughnut.

442
00:44:12,713 --> 00:44:15,632
- Mind if I take a look around?
- No, no, go ahead, go ahead.

443
00:44:29,646 --> 00:44:31,523
Where'd the call come from?

444
00:44:31,608 --> 00:44:33,526
The call came from inside the facility.

445
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:34,818
Copy that.

446
00:44:41,242 --> 00:44:44,079
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

447
00:44:44,162 --> 00:44:48,290
Just one more question.
Dispatch said the call came from here.

448
00:44:49,249 --> 00:44:51,835
Well, that's not possible.
I'm the only one here.

449
00:44:51,919 --> 00:44:54,213
I need you to get your hands up.

450
00:44:54,295 --> 00:44:56,507
And lay on the ground, face down. Now!

451
00:45:00,095 --> 00:45:01,846
What's the problem, Officer?

452
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:04,057
Keep your mouth shut
and lay on the ground.

453
00:45:06,226 --> 00:45:09,354
Take it easy. Look, look.
Everything's all right.

454
00:45:10,563 --> 00:45:11,897
Come on, sweetie. It's okay.

455
00:45:15,276 --> 00:45:17,111
Who the fuck are you?

456
00:45:17,195 --> 00:45:18,947
I think I should be asking you that.

457
00:45:19,029 --> 00:45:21,533
- What's your name?
- Tarin. My mom is...

458
00:45:21,614 --> 00:45:23,033
Tarin! Run!

459
00:45:23,117 --> 00:45:24,201
Mom!

460
00:45:45,346 --> 00:45:47,056
That's why you should travel in twos.

461
00:45:51,603 --> 00:45:53,273
Son of a bitch!

462
00:45:54,772 --> 00:45:56,065
Oh, my God!

463
00:45:56,942 --> 00:45:58,695
Damn it! Where are the keys?

464
00:45:58,777 --> 00:46:01,573
- Oh, my God, what do we do?
- Stay in the car. Shit.

465
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:04,908
Leave us alone.

466
00:46:04,992 --> 00:46:07,660
- Where's Ross?
- Where's my car?

467
00:46:07,745 --> 00:46:09,997
I only saw one person
come out of that locker.

468
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:13,750
Show me the key!

469
00:46:14,877 --> 00:46:17,462
- You found them, didn't ya?
- I don't care about the diamonds.

470
00:46:17,546 --> 00:46:19,380
I just wanna leave in my car.

471
00:46:19,464 --> 00:46:22,718
So you do know about the diamonds.
Congratulations.

472
00:46:26,304 --> 00:46:29,015
If I tell you where they are,
will you give me my car keys?

473
00:46:32,729 --> 00:46:34,147
Yeah.

474
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:39,692
Show me the key.

475
00:46:39,777 --> 00:46:41,320
Where are the diamonds?

476
00:46:41,402 --> 00:46:43,404
Throw me my car key first!

477
00:46:44,906 --> 00:46:47,033
You're a smart little bitch, aren't ya?

478
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:50,872
If you kill me, you won't ever find them.

479
00:47:00,588 --> 00:47:03,049
- Run to the gate, Tarin!
- Goddamn it!

480
00:47:03,132 --> 00:47:04,134
Tarin, run!

481
00:47:08,138 --> 00:47:10,556
- Let her go!
- Turn that shit off!

482
00:47:10,641 --> 00:47:13,725
- Let her go!
- I said turn that shit off, goddamn it,

483
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:15,562
or I'll snap her fucking neck!

484
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:18,399
Let go of me, you fucking vagina!

485
00:47:18,482 --> 00:47:21,275
- Some mouth on you, you little tramp.
- Mom!

486
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,906
Put it down. Put it down.

487
00:47:29,158 --> 00:47:30,411
Who the fuck are you?

488
00:47:32,788 --> 00:47:34,081
You're a cop?

489
00:47:34,872 --> 00:47:36,125
You noticed.

490
00:47:48,011 --> 00:47:52,348
This is Officer Harris. Cancel that 10-78.

491
00:47:55,518 --> 00:47:56,853
I'm sorry.

492
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:03,359
- Backup will be here soon.
- Why can't we just go now?

493
00:48:03,444 --> 00:48:07,071
Sorry, but we're gonna need
full statements from the both of you.

494
00:48:07,822 --> 00:48:10,198
Can't we just do that
in the morning, Detective?

495
00:48:11,701 --> 00:48:15,162
Listen, when the time's right,
you'll be the first ones to go home.

496
00:48:16,622 --> 00:48:19,585
- Where's the other guy?
- You said he was upstairs, right?

497
00:48:19,666 --> 00:48:22,210
Yes, he's locked up in 509.

498
00:48:23,171 --> 00:48:26,549
- My locker?
- It's the only one I could think of.

499
00:48:26,631 --> 00:48:28,633
Nice touch. What about Lee?

500
00:48:34,265 --> 00:48:36,392
How long were you following these guys?

501
00:48:36,475 --> 00:48:38,227
It wasn't them I was following.

502
00:48:39,771 --> 00:48:42,231
- What do you mean?
- I was following Lee undercover.

503
00:48:42,314 --> 00:48:44,024
He was a fence for stolen goods.

504
00:48:44,108 --> 00:48:47,486
We think he's got his fair share stashed
down here somewhere in these lockers.

505
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:49,905
Bet he's got a ton of shit
hidden up there.

506
00:48:50,948 --> 00:48:55,078
Well, if Lee had any other locker here,
it wasn't under his name.

507
00:48:55,161 --> 00:48:56,704
Did these men tell you anything else?

508
00:48:56,787 --> 00:48:58,372
They were after diamonds.

509
00:48:58,455 --> 00:49:01,792
The thieves responsible
for a diamond heist last week.

510
00:49:01,877 --> 00:49:05,713
Lee had 'em fixed up
with fake passports, the works.

511
00:49:06,798 --> 00:49:08,131
What heist?

512
00:49:08,716 --> 00:49:11,676
Stole $1.2 million in diamonds,
took a hostage.

513
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,388
That hostage is dead, a mother of two.

514
00:49:15,055 --> 00:49:16,390
Oh, my God.

515
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,560
Where are the other cops?

516
00:49:19,644 --> 00:49:22,187
- They're already here.
- Where?

517
00:49:22,271 --> 00:49:24,856
My team is two blocks away,
waiting for my signal.

518
00:49:25,649 --> 00:49:27,234
Well, what are you waiting for?

519
00:49:27,317 --> 00:49:30,071
Lee's buyer. There was a meeting set.

520
00:49:30,153 --> 00:49:32,989
I've been instructed to make sure
that we get the diamonds first.

521
00:49:33,073 --> 00:49:34,075
Oh, my God.

522
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,828
What?

523
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:38,328
He had a gun.

524
00:49:39,122 --> 00:49:41,915
Ross, the one upstairs,
I left him with a gun.

525
00:49:41,999 --> 00:49:44,669
Find a safe place, lock yourselves in.

526
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,503
I'm gonna find this Ross.

527
00:49:47,337 --> 00:49:49,423
What about the video closet?

528
00:49:49,506 --> 00:49:51,675
Yeah. That's a good idea.

529
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:03,060
Why does this room have to be so small?

530
00:50:05,897 --> 00:50:06,983
Hey, Mom?

531
00:50:08,357 --> 00:50:09,357
Yes?

532
00:50:10,777 --> 00:50:12,779
Are we gonna make it out of here?

533
00:50:14,448 --> 00:50:15,867
Of course.

534
00:50:17,869 --> 00:50:19,201
That cop…

535
00:50:21,788 --> 00:50:23,541
He killed her right in front of me.

536
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:26,668
I know, baby.

537
00:50:29,881 --> 00:50:31,757
They did the same thing to my boss.

538
00:50:34,593 --> 00:50:36,761
I'm sorry that I brought you tonight.

539
00:50:38,555 --> 00:50:39,556
Don't be.

540
00:50:41,766 --> 00:50:44,603
I mean, how… how else am I
gonna learn how to drive?

541
00:50:52,652 --> 00:50:54,112
Tarin.

542
00:50:54,195 --> 00:50:55,740
I smoke when I'm nervous.

543
00:50:59,409 --> 00:51:01,328
Where did you get all of this stuff?

544
00:51:02,953 --> 00:51:04,205
Stole it.

545
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:07,877
I'm a shoplifter. Sorry.

546
00:51:14,299 --> 00:51:15,842
Your grandfather…

547
00:51:18,094 --> 00:51:20,388
He caught me doing the exact same thing.

548
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:27,311
I promised him that I would stop stealing,
but then I met your father.

549
00:51:28,688 --> 00:51:29,690
Wait.

550
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,817
You were a shoplifter?

551
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:35,277
Yeah, a long time ago.

552
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:44,413
- Hey, Mom.
- Yeah?

553
00:51:45,454 --> 00:51:46,831
Happy birthday.

554
00:52:43,596 --> 00:52:44,679
Maggie?

555
00:52:48,267 --> 00:52:49,518
I'm here.

556
00:52:50,311 --> 00:52:53,190
- He's not here.
- What?

557
00:52:53,272 --> 00:52:57,319
He shot his way out.
Can you see anything on the monitor?

558
00:52:57,401 --> 00:52:58,569
There!

559
00:52:58,651 --> 00:53:00,236
Harris, he's on your floor. Get out!

560
00:53:01,739 --> 00:53:03,198
Harris, get out of there, now!

561
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:10,331
- Mom, do something!
- Don't shout at me, please. I don't know.

562
00:53:28,058 --> 00:53:30,600
Oh, my... Harris.

563
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:34,729
Thought you were smart, huh?

564
00:53:37,357 --> 00:53:40,026
I know you can hear me. Answer me!

565
00:53:43,531 --> 00:53:45,783
Okay, please, please don't hurt him.

566
00:53:45,865 --> 00:53:48,868
Either you find my diamonds
or the detective here dies.

567
00:53:48,952 --> 00:53:50,328
You have five minutes.

568
00:53:56,292 --> 00:53:59,212
Okay. Okay.

569
00:54:03,632 --> 00:54:06,261
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for something.

570
00:54:07,263 --> 00:54:09,723
Mom, we should just go.
The cops are two blocks away.

571
00:54:09,807 --> 00:54:12,267
We could go, we could find them,
and we could bring them here.

572
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:15,687
Detective Harris came back for us.
I can't just leave him up there.

573
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:18,480
There has to be some weapons
in the lockers that we can use.

574
00:54:21,942 --> 00:54:23,193
- Hello?
- Stop it!

575
00:54:23,278 --> 00:54:27,240
I need you to go into the video closet,
just lock the door. Do you understand?

576
00:54:27,323 --> 00:54:29,658
God, why are you being so stupid?

577
00:54:29,743 --> 00:54:31,578
They're gonna kill us.

578
00:54:32,245 --> 00:54:35,248
I have to help Harris.
It's the right thing to do.

579
00:54:35,332 --> 00:54:37,542
- Really?
- Yes, really.

580
00:54:39,002 --> 00:54:41,962
So were you doing the right thing
when you sold out Dad to the cops?

581
00:54:46,092 --> 00:54:49,804
He wanted to get caught.
He wanted to go away.

582
00:54:49,888 --> 00:54:51,723
But who told them where to find him?

583
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:56,312
Tarin. He would've been hunted down.

584
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:58,228
Us, too.

585
00:54:58,314 --> 00:55:01,149
Do you think that your parents in jail
and you in foster care

586
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,734
would have been a better choice?

587
00:55:03,318 --> 00:55:05,153
I did what I had to do.

588
00:55:05,987 --> 00:55:08,947
Why can't you just admit
that you stabbed Dad in the back?

589
00:55:09,033 --> 00:55:10,326
What?

590
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,493
You're the reason my dad
got taken away from me.

591
00:55:13,453 --> 00:55:16,831
You think everything you do is perfect,
but it's not, Mom.

592
00:55:16,915 --> 00:55:19,083
You pushed him away
and you made him feel small.

593
00:55:19,167 --> 00:55:21,687
And you try to control me
the same way you tried to control him.

594
00:55:21,754 --> 00:55:24,297
And soon enough, it's just gonna be you.

595
00:55:25,798 --> 00:55:27,592
Maybe that's just the way you want it.

596
00:55:29,134 --> 00:55:32,472
Ticktock, ticktock. Five minutes are up.

597
00:55:34,556 --> 00:55:36,558
Please, let me help you. You need my help.

598
00:55:36,643 --> 00:55:37,644
No. No.

599
00:55:37,726 --> 00:55:40,105
- You need to go into the video closet.
- No. Mom, no!

600
00:55:40,189 --> 00:55:42,231
Lock the door. If I don't come back soon,

601
00:55:42,315 --> 00:55:44,484
you need to run
as far from here as possible.

602
00:55:44,567 --> 00:55:46,860
Do you understand? Go!

603
00:55:57,288 --> 00:55:59,456
Lee. Lee.

604
00:56:18,518 --> 00:56:19,935
I found it.

605
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,489
What did you do, Lee?

606
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,976
Perfect.

607
00:57:58,784 --> 00:58:00,410
Son of a bitch.

608
00:58:27,562 --> 00:58:29,064
I'm here!

609
00:58:30,231 --> 00:58:32,901
That's a hell of a backswing
you got there, Maggie.

610
00:58:32,984 --> 00:58:33,986
Slow it down.

611
00:58:35,194 --> 00:58:37,865
- I found the locker.
- I'm not sure if I believe you,

612
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:39,783
but I'm sure you can
understand my distrust.

613
00:58:39,866 --> 00:58:40,993
Slow it down.

614
00:58:42,201 --> 00:58:44,620
- James Lee.
- What?

615
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,790
Lee's real name was James Lee Fenton.

616
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:49,334
That's how he hid the locker.

617
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:51,586
James Lee. That sneaky bastard.

618
00:58:51,668 --> 00:58:53,546
Slow it down, man.

619
00:58:53,629 --> 00:58:54,963
Get outta here, Maggie.

620
00:59:01,262 --> 00:59:03,766
He's not gonna let you
or your daughter go.

621
00:59:03,848 --> 00:59:05,933
Daughter? She's here?

622
00:59:06,769 --> 00:59:08,854
Mel's been shot, Ross. It's over.

623
00:59:08,937 --> 00:59:11,065
What the fuck did she say?

624
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,732
I shot him.

625
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:14,108
I don't fucking believe you!

626
00:59:14,192 --> 00:59:15,818
Look, I have what you want!

627
00:59:16,943 --> 00:59:19,654
Half the force is around the corner, Ross.

628
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:23,825
If you run now, maybe you make it.
Maybe you don't.

629
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:25,827
- Stop!
- Shut up!

630
00:59:26,872 --> 00:59:28,581
Don't you fucking move!

631
00:59:28,664 --> 00:59:29,665
Okay.

632
00:59:33,126 --> 00:59:34,670
Fuck.

633
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:37,006
Come on.

634
00:59:38,216 --> 00:59:39,299
Walk.

635
00:59:58,443 --> 00:59:59,695
Fuck this.

636
01:00:03,491 --> 01:00:04,909
Where are you going?

637
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:07,453
Who said I'm going anywhere?

638
01:00:07,536 --> 01:00:10,498
I know Lee was getting passports
for you to go somewhere.

639
01:00:11,456 --> 01:00:12,749
Out of the country?

640
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:15,211
Brazil.

641
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:19,383
Well, you're gonna have to leave Mel
behind. You can't take him onto a plane.

642
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:21,550
This is the one.

643
01:00:26,972 --> 01:00:28,306
Wait.

644
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:30,934
What?

645
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:32,228
I want five.

646
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:35,064
I can do $5,000.

647
01:00:35,148 --> 01:00:36,566
No, five percent.

648
01:00:39,985 --> 01:00:42,571
No one knows about this locker
except me and you.

649
01:00:45,115 --> 01:00:47,475
- What the fuck are you saying?
- Whatever we find in there,

650
01:00:47,534 --> 01:00:50,871
I can hold on to it until it's safe
for you to come back and get it.

651
01:00:51,873 --> 01:00:54,374
Your husband taught you well.

652
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:56,710
Maybe I taught him.

653
01:01:35,166 --> 01:01:36,667
What am I looking for again?

654
01:01:36,751 --> 01:01:38,669
A black velvet pouch.

655
01:01:38,753 --> 01:01:40,463
Ross. Ross.

656
01:01:40,544 --> 01:01:43,589
Hey! Hey! Hey!

657
01:01:43,672 --> 01:01:46,843
I'm downstairs.
I can see you on the monitor.

658
01:01:49,553 --> 01:01:51,555
You okay?

659
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:54,059
I took one in the shoulder,
but I got the girl.

660
01:01:56,602 --> 01:01:57,938
Where was she?

661
01:01:58,562 --> 01:02:01,023
I caught the little bitch
coming down the elevator.

662
01:02:01,107 --> 01:02:02,110
Please don't hurt her.

663
01:02:02,193 --> 01:02:04,821
You should've thought about that
before you brought her along.

664
01:02:04,903 --> 01:02:07,072
- Just let her go!
- Shut up!

665
01:02:07,154 --> 01:02:09,448
Any sign of more cops?

666
01:02:10,158 --> 01:02:11,993
Just the piece of shit that shot me.

667
01:02:12,077 --> 01:02:14,995
I got him tied up on the fifth.
He ain't going anywhere.

668
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:17,248
We gotta hurry. The flight's in two hours.

669
01:02:17,332 --> 01:02:18,875
- Okay.
- Mom?

670
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,378
- Tarin!
- Would you shut up!

671
01:02:22,462 --> 01:02:24,715
That's... That's for my head.

672
01:02:26,299 --> 01:02:28,927
- What about the girl?
- Take her to the roof with you.

673
01:02:30,678 --> 01:02:32,305
For what?

674
01:02:32,389 --> 01:02:35,599
The cop says
he's got half the force outside.

675
01:02:35,683 --> 01:02:37,519
Let's call his bluff.

676
01:02:38,185 --> 01:02:39,229
Then what?

677
01:02:39,312 --> 01:02:41,272
If it looks clear, we'll meet you outside.

678
01:02:43,899 --> 01:02:45,276
Get your ass in there.

679
01:02:52,491 --> 01:02:55,245
- Let's go.
- I'm not going to the roof with you.

680
01:02:55,328 --> 01:02:56,872
Get in here.

681
01:03:07,631 --> 01:03:09,091
You a virgin?

682
01:03:09,676 --> 01:03:10,886
What?

683
01:03:11,594 --> 01:03:14,388
It's a legitimate question.
Are you still a virgin?

684
01:03:15,098 --> 01:03:16,475
You're sick.

685
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:21,313
Judging by that attitude
and the way you look, I'd say no.

686
01:03:23,482 --> 01:03:24,940
You still in school?

687
01:03:25,649 --> 01:03:26,691
Yeah.

688
01:03:27,611 --> 01:03:28,904
How old are you?

689
01:03:29,654 --> 01:03:31,697
I'm 17. Why?

690
01:03:32,741 --> 01:03:34,700
You don't look 17.

691
01:03:34,785 --> 01:03:36,828
God, you're disgusting.

692
01:03:36,911 --> 01:03:38,829
Have you ever even seen a vagina?

693
01:03:59,307 --> 01:04:00,477
Ross.

694
01:04:03,522 --> 01:04:05,731
- What?
- I think there's something in here.

695
01:04:12,656 --> 01:04:13,863
How much is it?

696
01:04:13,948 --> 01:04:15,783
You are a genius.

697
01:04:21,622 --> 01:04:24,084
You really think the cops
are gonna let you see them?

698
01:04:24,166 --> 01:04:26,043
- They're hiding.
- Shut up.

699
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:29,089
I bet there are 50 of 'em out there.

700
01:04:30,755 --> 01:04:32,173
Yeah.

701
01:04:33,342 --> 01:04:35,427
Half the force, my ass.

702
01:04:40,392 --> 01:04:42,226
Son of a bitch.

703
01:04:53,278 --> 01:04:54,863
There's like 20 grand in here.

704
01:04:54,947 --> 01:04:56,157
Then it'll have to do.

705
01:04:56,948 --> 01:04:58,118
No, fuck that.

706
01:04:59,452 --> 01:05:02,204
- The diamonds are in here somewhere.
- Well, I can find them.

707
01:05:02,287 --> 01:05:03,621
After you leave.

708
01:05:04,749 --> 01:05:05,834
Really?

709
01:05:07,293 --> 01:05:10,211
You would do that for five percent?

710
01:05:11,796 --> 01:05:12,923
It's ten percent now.

711
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:16,301
Now you are negotiating?

712
01:05:16,385 --> 01:05:18,763
You have nothing to trade with, but…

713
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,474
I can delete the footage.

714
01:05:21,556 --> 01:05:22,641
All of it.

715
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:25,477
You said you didn't know how.

716
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,396
Do you want the diamonds or not?

717
01:05:29,106 --> 01:05:31,316
The deal stands at five percent.

718
01:05:34,612 --> 01:05:36,655
I can find out where Lee hid the diamonds

719
01:05:36,738 --> 01:05:38,989
by going back
in the footage a couple of days.

720
01:05:41,283 --> 01:05:43,620
- Let's go do it.
- No, I can't do it now.

721
01:05:43,703 --> 01:05:47,582
System doesn't allow access
until the morning.

722
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:48,918
By then, you'll be gone.

723
01:05:50,753 --> 01:05:54,297
What about the police? They're gonna be
asking for the files, too.

724
01:05:54,381 --> 01:05:56,383
Not if I delete them first.

725
01:05:58,717 --> 01:06:01,888
You fuck me over and it ain't me
you'd have to worry about.

726
01:06:01,972 --> 01:06:03,598
Believe me.

727
01:06:03,682 --> 01:06:08,852
Mel would rather gut you
from side to side,

728
01:06:08,938 --> 01:06:10,605
and your little kid too,

729
01:06:10,689 --> 01:06:13,358
than be sitting on some beach in Brazil,

730
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,360
drinking margarita and shit.

731
01:06:16,027 --> 01:06:17,570
You understand me?

732
01:06:21,075 --> 01:06:22,617
Yeah, so, ten percent?

733
01:06:26,372 --> 01:06:29,624
What else you gonna include
in this ten percent?

734
01:06:37,632 --> 01:06:38,758
Walk.

735
01:06:40,845 --> 01:06:42,972
Slow down. Stay back.

736
01:06:43,972 --> 01:06:44,974
Ross...

737
01:06:49,227 --> 01:06:51,895
Let go of the fucking gun!
Give me the gun! Where are the diamonds?

738
01:06:51,981 --> 01:06:53,313
- I don't know!
- Where are they?

739
01:06:53,398 --> 01:06:55,733
Let him go! They have Tarin!

740
01:06:55,818 --> 01:06:57,658
She'll be fine.
Where are the fucking diamonds?

741
01:06:57,736 --> 01:06:59,530
Harris, listen to me. Mel has Tarin.

742
01:06:59,612 --> 01:07:01,781
Maggie, shut the fuck up.
Where are the diamonds?

743
01:07:01,864 --> 01:07:04,344
My people are around the corner.
They're waiting for my signal.

744
01:07:04,409 --> 01:07:05,827
Where are the fucking diamonds?

745
01:07:05,909 --> 01:07:07,286
Get off!

746
01:07:10,457 --> 01:07:11,915
Oh, my God.

747
01:07:13,711 --> 01:07:15,086
Oh, my God!

748
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:16,714
- Get the money.
- Harris!

749
01:07:16,795 --> 01:07:19,299
- Get my fucking money.
- Harris!

750
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:24,511
- Oh, my God, no, Harris.
- Come on, we gotta go. We gotta go!

751
01:07:33,187 --> 01:07:34,438
Hey, asshole!

752
01:08:06,388 --> 01:08:07,514
You alive?

753
01:08:10,058 --> 01:08:11,393
Oh, shit.

754
01:08:19,316 --> 01:08:20,944
God, I thought you were dead.

755
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:22,986
I guess not.

756
01:08:35,124 --> 01:08:37,418
That cop's already dead, Ross.

757
01:08:37,502 --> 01:08:38,962
Mel killed her.

758
01:08:39,043 --> 01:08:40,547
Where is he?

759
01:08:41,714 --> 01:08:43,091
How would I know?

760
01:08:45,342 --> 01:08:47,429
We'll take this car to pick up our car,

761
01:08:47,512 --> 01:08:49,596
the one you're driving us
to the airport with.

762
01:08:50,346 --> 01:08:52,015
I wanna know where Tarin is.

763
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,726
Where the fuck is Mel?

764
01:08:57,895 --> 01:08:59,149
Mel!

765
01:09:00,481 --> 01:09:02,066
Can't you call him or something?

766
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:03,359
With what cell phone, huh?

767
01:09:03,444 --> 01:09:05,280
We dumped them. It's too fucking risky.

768
01:09:05,361 --> 01:09:08,073
God. That was smart.

769
01:09:09,241 --> 01:09:10,658
Why don't you fucking figure out

770
01:09:10,743 --> 01:09:12,783
how to fucking delete the footage
or some shit, huh?

771
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:14,663
Not until I see Tarin!

772
01:09:15,372 --> 01:09:19,334
Mel! Mel! Don't you fucking move. Mel!

773
01:09:22,129 --> 01:09:24,631
Why did you come here tonight?

774
01:09:24,716 --> 01:09:27,427
You could've met Lee anywhere. Why here?

775
01:09:27,508 --> 01:09:30,803
We went to his house.
Paid him and his wife a little visit.

776
01:09:30,887 --> 01:09:33,222
Poor bastard had no idea
we even knew where he lived.

777
01:09:33,306 --> 01:09:34,724
Where's Pilar?

778
01:09:36,935 --> 01:09:40,189
I tell him Mel wasn't fucking joking,
but Lee didn't listen.

779
01:09:41,648 --> 01:09:44,400
My God. What did you do?

780
01:09:45,109 --> 01:09:47,362
I didn't do shit.
Look, I didn't do nothing.

781
01:09:47,445 --> 01:09:49,405
I just let Mel off his chain, that's all.

782
01:09:50,783 --> 01:09:52,825
Is she alive?

783
01:09:54,118 --> 01:09:56,371
If I had to guess, no.

784
01:09:58,498 --> 01:10:01,417
- You fucking bastard!
- Hey, calm the fuck down!

785
01:10:01,502 --> 01:10:05,047
- What did she ever do to you?
- Hey.

786
01:10:05,129 --> 01:10:08,175
- What did she ever do to you?
- Hey, calm down.

787
01:10:08,257 --> 01:10:09,550
Okay, so just…

788
01:10:56,849 --> 01:10:58,516
Where are my diamonds?

789
01:11:01,561 --> 01:11:03,521
I want my diamonds!

790
01:11:23,666 --> 01:11:25,918
Please. Tarin.

791
01:11:27,252 --> 01:11:28,546
Please, what?

792
01:11:28,628 --> 01:11:30,716
I just want my daughter back.

793
01:11:31,425 --> 01:11:34,051
And I want my fucking diamonds.

794
01:11:34,136 --> 01:11:35,970
Okay. They're on the roof.

795
01:11:36,054 --> 01:11:37,471
Bullshit.

796
01:11:38,306 --> 01:11:40,558
Lee was up there three times this week.

797
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,184
I know they're there.

798
01:11:45,395 --> 01:11:47,314
All right, get your ass up and show me.

799
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:03,538
Fuck! No shells.

800
01:12:07,877 --> 01:12:11,254
Listen, you stay here
until I can go find your mom, okay?

801
01:12:11,339 --> 01:12:13,424
- No, I'm coming with you.
- Not a good idea.

802
01:12:13,507 --> 01:12:14,925
You stay put.

803
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,177
Stay put.

804
01:12:30,233 --> 01:12:31,734
What the shit?

805
01:12:43,452 --> 01:12:45,163
"Tap to ignite."

806
01:12:45,957 --> 01:12:47,207
Fuck yeah.

807
01:14:19,299 --> 01:14:21,051
Gotcha.

808
01:14:32,269 --> 01:14:36,732
Code, my ass.
This shit ain't even backed up.

809
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:01,258
Bet you didn't see that one coming.

810
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:04,886
Yeah.

811
01:15:04,969 --> 01:15:06,887
I'm getting tired of you.

812
01:15:08,514 --> 01:15:10,932
Where are the diamonds?

813
01:15:11,018 --> 01:15:13,603
I don't… I don't… I don't know.

814
01:15:13,687 --> 01:15:15,646
You're not going anywhere, Ross.

815
01:15:16,857 --> 01:15:21,278
At least let someone else enjoy
the fruits of your labor.

816
01:15:29,617 --> 01:15:30,785
Maggie.

817
01:15:30,871 --> 01:15:32,581
She knows where they are?

818
01:15:34,416 --> 01:15:36,542
Suck my...

819
01:15:40,839 --> 01:15:42,255
Suck on that.

820
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,470
Cool.

821
01:16:04,945 --> 01:16:06,530
How much further?

822
01:16:06,615 --> 01:16:08,991
He was always around this back area.

823
01:16:21,338 --> 01:16:23,798
- Now what?
- Now we dig.

824
01:16:26,424 --> 01:16:29,094
- Are you gonna help me?
- No.

825
01:16:32,598 --> 01:16:34,558
Thought you guys had a flight to catch.

826
01:16:35,893 --> 01:16:37,560
Just keep digging.

827
01:16:37,645 --> 01:16:39,605
Fine. But you should know that…

828
01:16:40,482 --> 01:16:44,026
- I made a deal with your partner.
- What deal?

829
01:16:45,026 --> 01:16:47,404
Ten percent of the value.

830
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,781
I guess he figured
you'd be okay with that.

831
01:16:49,865 --> 01:16:51,909
Shut up and find the diamonds.

832
01:16:54,285 --> 01:16:59,666
Or what, you gonna kill me
like you did Lee?

833
01:16:59,749 --> 01:17:00,750
Pilar?

834
01:17:01,544 --> 01:17:03,462
Was that her name?

835
01:17:03,545 --> 01:17:04,879
She wasn't much fun.

836
01:17:06,589 --> 01:17:08,425
- What?
- She didn't put up a fight.

837
01:17:08,508 --> 01:17:10,218
If there's no struggle, it ain't no fun.

838
01:17:10,302 --> 01:17:11,721
You're sick.

839
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:14,389
You.

840
01:17:14,473 --> 01:17:16,183
You're gonna be fun.

841
01:17:17,017 --> 01:17:18,476
I think I found something.

842
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:21,105
Show me.

843
01:17:30,614 --> 01:17:31,615
Nice.

844
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:22,373
Help!

845
01:18:25,502 --> 01:18:26,961
Help!

846
01:18:29,088 --> 01:18:30,714
That's for Lee, you piece of shit.

847
01:19:06,167 --> 01:19:07,252
What is that?

848
01:19:08,378 --> 01:19:09,379
Evidence.

849
01:19:10,338 --> 01:19:13,215
Why are you hiding it?
I thought backup was just two blocks away.

850
01:19:13,298 --> 01:19:16,176
No one's calling backup
until I have those diamonds.

851
01:19:16,261 --> 01:19:17,387
You remember?

852
01:19:17,470 --> 01:19:19,847
I thought Lee was your contact. And then...

853
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:21,932
You're too smart for your own good,
aren't you?

854
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:25,520
- Wait, you?
- Surprise.

855
01:19:26,311 --> 01:19:30,482
- There is no backup, is there?
- No. Just me.

856
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,236
What about the cop? Aren't they sending
someone to check on her?

857
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,865
They did. I canceled it.

858
01:19:42,454 --> 01:19:47,374
Wait, so you turned into a dirty cop,
just so you could steal some diamonds?

859
01:19:47,458 --> 01:19:50,461
No. Not just any diamonds.

860
01:19:50,544 --> 01:19:54,007
When they're considered stolen,
cops have no incentive to find them.

861
01:19:55,506 --> 01:19:57,760
They just wanna find the guys that did it.

862
01:19:57,843 --> 01:19:59,762
The insurance does the rest.

863
01:20:01,056 --> 01:20:04,642
Then I retire from this shit job
protecting people like you.

864
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:09,938
I thought you were Lee's friend.

865
01:20:11,357 --> 01:20:13,108
How long you been there, Maggie?

866
01:20:13,192 --> 01:20:15,028
Long enough to hear everything.

867
01:20:16,235 --> 01:20:19,324
The diamonds, where are they?

868
01:20:22,077 --> 01:20:23,160
Where are the rest?

869
01:20:23,243 --> 01:20:25,662
Let her go first.

870
01:20:26,455 --> 01:20:30,542
First, you tell me,
what were you gonna do with this?

871
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:33,378
I made that before I knew you were a cop.

872
01:20:34,962 --> 01:20:36,632
Last chance, Maggie.

873
01:20:38,676 --> 01:20:40,010
Mom.

874
01:20:40,094 --> 01:20:41,720
- Follow me.
- Hey!

875
01:20:45,933 --> 01:20:46,935
Maggie!

876
01:20:52,939 --> 01:20:54,148
Behave yourself.

877
01:20:56,568 --> 01:20:58,987
I trusted you, Harris.

878
01:21:00,113 --> 01:21:03,324
I haven't trusted anyone in a long time.

879
01:21:05,284 --> 01:21:07,788
You know, I used to be an addict.

880
01:21:07,871 --> 01:21:09,914
I was a junkie.

881
01:21:09,997 --> 01:21:11,624
I was sick.

882
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:14,628
Just when I…

883
01:21:16,337 --> 01:21:18,131
didn't think that I would make it to 30…

884
01:21:19,257 --> 01:21:22,552
my husband Rich helped me get clean.

885
01:21:22,636 --> 01:21:27,182
It was Rich who saved me
after I OD'd on his couch.

886
01:21:28,891 --> 01:21:32,270
I've done a lot of things
that I'm not proud of,

887
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:35,190
that I tried to put away,

888
01:21:35,274 --> 01:21:36,483
forget about.

889
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,444
Am I supposed to be impressed?

890
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:41,155
I already died once.

891
01:21:41,237 --> 01:21:43,157
I'm not afraid of you.

892
01:21:43,238 --> 01:21:45,701
- Mom.
- Tarin, shoelaces.

893
01:21:46,702 --> 01:21:47,786
Goddamn!

894
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:55,792
Fucking little bitch.

895
01:22:01,425 --> 01:22:04,385
- Where are the keys? Where are the keys?
- They're on the cop's body.

896
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:05,721
Oh, my God. Come on.

897
01:22:26,866 --> 01:22:28,744
Wait, wait. He won't know the code.

898
01:22:30,661 --> 01:22:32,663
- Damn it.
- Mom!

899
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:34,289
It still works.

900
01:22:40,756 --> 01:22:41,964
Mom!

901
01:22:58,231 --> 01:22:59,233
Come on.

902
01:23:09,617 --> 01:23:11,078
Come on.

903
01:23:15,581 --> 01:23:18,418
- Come on.
- Where is he?

904
01:23:50,198 --> 01:23:51,783
Oh, fuck.

905
01:25:01,143 --> 01:25:02,436
Where's Tarin?

906
01:25:07,943 --> 01:25:09,528
You want your diamonds?

907
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:11,072
Come and get them.

908
01:25:11,781 --> 01:25:13,366
He hid them in here, huh?

909
01:25:14,075 --> 01:25:15,200
Pretty smart.

910
01:25:18,327 --> 01:25:20,205
Not as smart as this.

911
01:25:26,169 --> 01:25:27,421
No! No!

912
01:25:28,588 --> 01:25:29,589
No!

913
01:25:33,884 --> 01:25:37,263
Run, run. Run…

914
01:25:37,347 --> 01:25:38,390
Oh, my God!

915
01:26:31,275 --> 01:26:34,402
Hey, are you sure it's 206 coming up red?

916
01:26:34,487 --> 01:26:36,112
That's what it's showing.

917
01:26:36,197 --> 01:26:37,365
Okay, I'll check it out.

918
01:26:44,955 --> 01:26:46,665
Who turned off the AC?

919
01:27:34,463 --> 01:27:37,299
Maggie? Maggie, you there?

920
01:27:38,008 --> 01:27:39,467
Everything okay?

921
01:27:40,343 --> 01:27:41,553
I'm okay.
