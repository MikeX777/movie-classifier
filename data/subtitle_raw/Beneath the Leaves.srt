00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:02,728
Look at this.

16
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,264
Chewing your fingernails
again, huh?

17
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,701
I'm telling you,
I'm telling you, I'm sick of it.

18
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:11,403
Now, just because your parents,

19
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,806
didn't love you enough to treat
you better or teach you right.

20
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:16,775
So now, you got me.

21
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:23,715
Shut up!

22
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,185
Stay still.

23
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,209
Upstairs.

24
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,564
Just be quiet.

25
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,333
That's my girl.

26
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,769
Yeah.

27
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,263
Kids!

28
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,631
Get me out!

29
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,336
Kids!

30
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,407
Help me. Open the door!

31
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,908
Get--

32
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,956
Man down! Police!
Put it down!

33
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,708
Drop your weapon!

34
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,459
- Freeze!
- Give it up!

35
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,741
<i> Uh, this morning,</i>
<i>at approximately 300 hours,</i>

36
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:18,844
Some serious malefactors
started a fire at Pendleton,

37
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,479
and escaped.

38
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,646
How many, Cap?

39
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,816
Well, we think around six.

40
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:27,386
You have the folders.
They're complete.

41
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:30,455
One of the escaped prisoners
just killed a police officer

42
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,391
over in Ramona County.

43
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,059
Really bad motherfuckers, okay?

44
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,661
So, we have to be worse
than them.

45
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,697
<i> The fire</i>
<i>is under control.</i>

46
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,966
<i>But they are still at large.</i>

47
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,469
<i>We need two-man teams.</i>

48
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,673
Some on the phones.

49
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:49,775
Some on the field.

50
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,843
That's a great idea, Captain.

51
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,512
I'm so glad you approve.

52
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,782
All right, any questions?

53
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,521
They're dangerous,
go after them.

54
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,023
Protect our community, yeah?
That's what we're here to do.

55
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,427
Dismissed.

56
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,828
I'll see you in the back.

57
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:12,564
Morning.

58
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,000
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

59
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,171
Hm.

60
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:20,739
Davis, what's all this stuff?

61
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,207
Looks like paperwork to me.

62
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,843
It's got your name on it.

63
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:27,078
Yeah, we're a team, remember?

64
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,481
I scratch your back,
you scratch my ass?

65
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,887
Hey. Get your shit together.
Stop showing up late.

66
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,627
Damn, damn.

67
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,234
Shotwell, Larson,
in here, please.

68
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:58,743
Be nice.

69
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:01,646
Have a seat, will you?

70
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,121
All right, as of now, you two
are on domestic disturbance.

71
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,923
Uh, with all due respect, Sir,

72
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,159
why don't you just put us
on neighborhood watch?

73
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,628
Listen, this is our hood, okay?

74
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,730
So if some stay-at-home mom

75
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,699
hears a flower pot
being knocked over

76
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,367
by a stray cat,

77
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,034
and thinks
it's Jeffrey fucking Dahmer,

78
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,637
we're gonna investigate.

79
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,540
That, I understand.

80
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,575
Sir.

81
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,115
Erica.

82
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,884
I'm sorry, Captain,
he's just, uh,

83
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,785
- he's going through some stuff.
- I love the both of you,

84
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:41,853
you know that.

85
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,156
All right.

86
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,092
There's something
I have to acquaint you with.

87
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,304
- Hey.
- Hey.

88
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,308
It's you and me.
We're on a date tonight.

89
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:06,811
In public?

90
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:09,714
Yeah.

91
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,018
We talked about this.

92
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,321
Come on.

93
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,125
Do you value your job?

94
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,327
I do, actually. Yeah.

95
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:26,231
One shot makes me calm.

96
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,600
Two shots makes me patient.

97
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:29,834
Polite.

98
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,074
Fix this up.

99
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:53,191
Come on,
we have people cutting steaks

100
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,626
with their hands, go.

101
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,928
We need silverware.
<i>Andale, andale.</i>

102
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,030
Thank you.

103
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,837
<i> They are armed</i>
<i>and dangerous.</i>

104
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,272

<i>Ramona County, Channel Five.</i>

109
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,263
I'm not,
I'm not gonna play babysitter.

110
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,733
Well, that makes two of us.

111
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,301
Women find you comforting.

112
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,670
Women find me intimidating.

113
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,105
Besides, I did
the "there, there" thing

114
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,172
at the past three houses.

115
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,224
It is your turn.

116
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,275
We'll settle this right now,
fair and square.

117
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,411
We'll flip for it.

118
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,880
Heads.

119
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,315
Fuck.

120
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:03,962
Thank god, you're here.

121
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,296
Hi, ma'am, Julian PD.

122
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,065
This is Detective Shotwell,
I'm Detective Larson.

123
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,867
You called in a disturbance?

124
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,668
Yeah, I heard a noise from
the house across the street.

125
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,203
Okay. Ma'am,
did you see anything?

126
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,972
I'm not gonna go over there.
It was horrible.

127
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,074
We understand.

128
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,909
You stay right here,

129
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,743
and I will go and make sure
that the coast is clear.

130
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:20,879
You can't
leave me here alone.

131
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,781
No, no.
This able-bodied detective

132
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,683
will be right here,
keeping you company.

133
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,017
Thank you.

134
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,318
Sure.

135
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,987
Really?

136
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,223
Um...

137
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,325
Ma'am, do you mind
if I asked you

138
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,426
- a few more questions?
- No, do you want to come in?

139
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:35,827
Yeah, sure, yeah. Thank you.

140
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,841
This is Shotwell!

141
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,377
Code 11-47.

142
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,345
I need an EMT
and back up, stat!

143
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,194
Damn it.

144
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:53,771
It's okay, sweetie.
It's okay.

145
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,840
It's okay. It's okay.

146
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,008
It's gonna be okay.

147
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,109
It's okay.

148
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,812
Oh, Jesus.

149
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,874
Ah!

150
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,591
Did you clock out already?

151
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,028
No.

152
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,329
You working tomorrow?

153
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,898
Yeah.

154
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,935
You don't really have
much to say, do you?

155
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,938
No.

156
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,873
"No."

157
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,409
You don't ever just...

158
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,079
enjoy the silence?

159
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:11,382
Is that your polite way
of telling me to shut up?

160
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,288
I'm gonna go check my tables.

161
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,356
Okay.

162
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah!

163
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:32,270
And that, that, Richard,
is how it's done.

164
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:33,638
So, can I have
my money, please?

165
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,974
- Very good.
- Thank you, sir.

166
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,342
Thank you. Always a pleasure.

167
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,211
- All right.
- Thanks.

168
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,081
- Look at that.
- Hey, Larson.

169
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,016
You might shoot pool
better than criminals.

170
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,586
It's too soon, man.
It's just too soon.

171
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:52,056
You know what, that guy
was ten feet away, it was not...

172
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,459
The shot, well,
it kicked him in the face.

173
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,031
Hey, I say
that uppity bitch had it coming.

174
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,399
She needed to be taken down
a peg or two.

175
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,901
All right...

176
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:05,103
- slow down.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

177
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,437
Can you do me a favor?

178
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,072
Can you fuck this stick
out of her ass?

179
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,807
And tell her
to lighten up a bit.

180
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,541
I'll fucking knock you
in the face, Davis. Seriously.

181
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:12,610
He has her, Davis.

182
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:17,582
Hi.

183
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,251
You know.

184
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,586
Fuck.

185
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,654
Boo.

186
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,526
It's good to know how you guys
really feel about me.

187
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,398
You wanna take a crack at me?

188
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,507
Erica.

189
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,642

190
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,577

191
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,480
Stop. Stop. Stop.

Please, stop.

195
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,155

199
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,632
Yeah, that's what I thought
it was gonna be,

200
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,200
but I guess you couldn't wait
for me to start.

201
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,436
We have time.
We have time.

202

You're so beautiful.

203
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,507
No.

204

Listen to me.

205
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,477
I can't.

206
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,114
Not with you like this.

207
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:25,616
Erica.

208
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,619
I'm sorry.

209
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,121
Get home safe.

<i>I just received confirmation</i>

212

Just, can we,
can we not to do this?

226
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,149
What?

227
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,352
Just...

228
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,120
Let's not do this, okay?

229
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,157
What's wrong?

230
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,726
I don't know. Um, I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm sorry.

231
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:43,728
Okay, fine.

232
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,164
We can take it slow.

233

You should... You should leave.

234

You need to go.

235
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:02,413
Matt.

236
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,684
See you, Matt.

237
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,800
- <i> What?</i>
<i>-  You're overwhelmed.</i>

238
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,169
- And you're too close to it.
- No.

239
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,771
- No.
- What do you mean "no"?

240
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,473
I mean,
with all due respect, sir.

241
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,341
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

242
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:31,709
- These are my brothers.
- And we will solve the case.

243
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,611
No, sir, not without me,
you won't.

244
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,279
You cannot take me off the case.

245
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,814
- You are dismissed.
- Fuck.

246
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:37,882
Fuck!

247
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,817
Fuck! What are you gonna do?

248
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,686
You're gonna put Anthony
on the case?

249
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:44,222
Huh? Is Anthony gonna fuck--
Fuck you!

250
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,723
Good job. Good luck.

251
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,225
Good fuckin' luck!

252
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:48,292
Brian.

253
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,130
What just happened?

254
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,566
What was that all about?

255
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,502
Let me explain.

256
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,307
Come here.

257
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,677
Twenty years ago...

258
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:10,414
four foster brothers,
little boys, were abducted,

259
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,817
and kept in a mine shaft
for two weeks.

260
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,619
The names...

261
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:16,821
were George Middleton,

262
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,524
Matt Tresner,
Josh Ridley, and...

263
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,927
- Brian Larson?
- That's right.

264
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,664
Jesus.

265
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,598
And they escaped.
Larson got them out somehow.

266
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,668
An incredible situation.

267
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,638
The perp is a dirtbag
by the name of James Whitley.

268
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,841
We know that Whitley
was the one who started the fire

269
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,744
to effectuate the escape
from Pendleton.

270
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,180
Now, listen, Brian can't be
on this case anymore.

271
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,414
He's too close to it. Abrams!

272
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,318
This is your partner now.

273
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,387
Inspector Shotwell.

274
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:50,621
Pleasure to be your mate.

275
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,491
He's been undercover
for eight months.

276
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:54,659
You got to bring him up
to speed.

277
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:57,295
- But...
- Dismissed.

278
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,896
- Thank you, sir.
- Yes, sir.

- Yeah.

366
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:00,965
- Hmm. Mm.
- Safeword is pickle.

367
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,000
Shit, we got safewords?

368
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,902
Oh, love this shit.

369
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:06,804
Would you like
to see my pickle?

370
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:09,907
I said shut up.

371
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:11,675
Oh.

372
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,944
You must be broken.

373
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:16,213
Yeah. Fix me, baby.
Fix me.

374
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,566
What the hell is that?

375
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:38,536
Is that some damn Beethoven?

376
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:39,670
What're you doing?

377
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,606
Hmm.

378
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,241
Yeah. Be gentle though, baby.

379
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:45,976
Hm.

380
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,580
Yeah.

381
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:52,616
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's it.
There you go right there. Oh!

382
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,755
Oh, there she is.

383
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:59,189
That's what I'm talking about.

384
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:00,257
Ugh. Pickle.

385
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:03,093
Ugh! What the fuck you're doing?

386
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:04,728
It's Mozart.

387
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,297
- But you were close.
- What the fuck?

388
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:09,900
Relax. Relax.

389
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:11,869
I have something...

390
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,871
something inspired
by our own government.

391
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,074
Lethal injection.

392
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,109
Uh-huh.

393
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,115
I do tend to use a little extra
potassium chloride.

394
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,350
Yeah.

395
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,704
There, there. Relax.

396
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,208
It typically starts
with one single sore,

397
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:53,277
the entry point.

398
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,212
It breaks in.

399
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:58,782
Infiltrates enemy lines.

400
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:01,785
It nags, it lingers. It...

401
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,122
It fights.

402
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:07,024
It builds an army.

403
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:10,361
And then...

404
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:11,629
...poof.

405
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:20,304
Within seconds...

406
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:23,707
your heart...

407
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:26,410
surrenders.

408
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:33,851
Everything's
gonna be okay, Josh.

409
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:36,754
You're free.

410
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,178
Dana.

411
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,880
<i>Brian, I can't find Josh.</i>

412
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:04,381
Huh? Hey, calm down.
Sorry, what?

413
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,400
<i> I know he went out</i>
<i>last night, drinking.</i>

414
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:08,418
<i>This is the last time.
I'm not gonna take this shit</i>

415
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:10,921
<i>- anymore.</i>
- No, you know what, I'm...

416
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:12,289
He'll be all right.
I'll make some phone calls.

417
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,957
Just stay by your phone,
I'll call you back, okay?

418
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,392
<i> Tell you brother</i>
<i>to get his ass--</i>

419
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:37,781
This guy, um...

420
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,251
Have you seen him lately?

421
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,387
I saw him
last night, actually.

422
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,022
But I think he left with a pro.

423
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,393
Can you describe her?

424
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,795
Yeah, she was,
uh, early 30's.

425
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,297
Tall, brown hair.

426
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,364
Kinda pale.

427
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:56,900
Huh.

428
00:28:58,104 --> 00:28:59,269
Yeah, all right.

429
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,771
Yeah. I mean, keep it.

430
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,641
Do you know where they went?

431
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,075
<i> What potential</i>
<i>do foster parents</i>

432
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,376
<i>possess themselves?</i>

433
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,880
<i>They're an abomination.</i>

434
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:12,316
<i>God himself, has cursed them.</i>

435
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:13,784
<i>They, they cannot,</i>

436
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:15,819
<i>of their own accord,
bear children.</i>

437
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:18,822
<i>They cannot bear fruit,
and like maggots,</i>

438
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:20,958
<i>they must feast on the flesh</i>

439
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,526
<i>of those
who do not belong to them,</i>

440
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,094
<i>in order to feel...</i>

441
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,349
Where are you?

442
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,434
Parker put you
on my brother's case, right?

443
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,336
Yes. But, Brian, are you okay?

444
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:35,405
All right, look.
Josh's wife called me.

445
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:37,141
She hasn't seen him.
She's worried sick.

446
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:39,877
So, I went to visit
a couple places

447
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,145
that we used to go.

448
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:42,913
<i>The bartender at Jones'</i>

449
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:46,383
<i>remembers seeing him leave
with a pro last night.</i>

450
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:48,185
Anadelle Motel,
you ever heard of it?

451
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,469
Can I help you?

452
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:10,240
Detective Shotwell,
Detective Abrams.

453
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:12,026
We're looking for someone

454
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:13,811
who might have
passed through here last night.

455
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:15,546
Uh, may I please see
your log sheet?

456
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,351
Okay, well, I can
speed things up, if you'd like.

457
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:23,086
Just takes one call
to my superiors.

458
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,988
Then I submit an affidavit
to the judge

459
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,090
that states that you are running
a prostitution ring

460
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,342
out of this motel.

461
00:30:28,343 --> 00:30:29,593
They will come here.
They will take your license,

462
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:30,861
they will take your motel.

463
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:32,396
And they will give you
five to ten.

464
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:34,364
Or you can just show me
the log sheet,

465
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:36,233
and this conversation
never happened.

466
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,504
Is this the shooter station?

467
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,573
Mm-hm.

468
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:45,075
Did you read
the section on Point St. George?

469
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,543
I went there last spring.

470
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,280
Gorgeous.

471
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:53,517
Peter Piper.

472
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,986
- That's a pseudonym.
- You think?

473
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,423
All right, look.

474
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:05,128
Is this the Peter Piper
that checked in last night?

475
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,497
It's hard to say.
He's fine-looking.

476
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,900
A shrike?

477
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,378
They pierce their food
on thorns.

478
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,981
It holds them in position
so they can eat small bites.

479
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,949
Abrams.

480
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:30,053
Uh, sorry.

481
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,922
I'm gonna need to see this room.

482
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:53,911
You should take some
of my apples home with you.

483
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:56,313
My crops this year
have been delicious.

484
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:59,483
Is that a temptation?

485
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,421
<i>Malus Domestica.</i>

486
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,625
It's the fall of humanity.

487
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:12,162
Actually, in Norse
and Greek mythology,

488
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,565
this represents eternal youth.

489
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:16,667
Really?

490
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,940
What are you doing?

491
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,610
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

492
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:28,645
Thank you.

493
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,252
Okay.

494
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:37,454
So, Josh bunks
with the lady of the evening

495
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,056
at the no-tell-motel.

496
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:41,391
This was his room.

497
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,226
We swept it.

498
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,294
But...

499
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:47,965
Oh.

500
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:50,000
We did find something.

501
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,538
It's a fingernail.

502
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,573
In Whitley's file, he took them
from all of the victims.

503
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:59,643
If that fingernail
belongs to Josh Ridley...

504
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:02,679
why him? He's not a kid.

505
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,282
Well, he has to finish
what he started.

506
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:06,483
There's something that I found

507
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,418
that I think
you'll find interesting.

508
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,154
So, all ten of the victims
were taken

509
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,056
from or around Julian.

510
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:14,658
And although
Whitley's spree

511
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,693
lasted for 11 years,

512
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:19,629
He took them all
at the same time of year.

513
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,264
It's a cyclical pattern.

514
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,667
And the fingernails?

515
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,736
The fingernails
are part of his M.O.

516
00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:28,338
So, our one dead body
was missing hers.

517
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,506
And in the mineshaft,

518
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,209
we had jars of fingernails
and seeds.

519
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:34,711
And then, saplings, alongside.

520
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:36,513
But her cause of death,

521
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,615
the potassium chloride
is consistent

522
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,083
with the other victim's DNA

523
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,452
found on the hypodermic needles
in the shaft.

524
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:46,289
He was essentially euthanizing
all of these foster children.

525
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,091
He's kinda like a bird.

526
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,159
What's that?

527
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:52,462
Well, it, sort of, uh...

528
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:54,164
There's evidence.

529
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,166
It's all the victims
in the mine.

530
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:57,467
You'd keep them there.

531
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,136
Like a nest.

532
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:01,038
No matter how far you had to go
to find someone,

533
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,273
he would always return to it.

534
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:07,244
What, what I don't understand
is why

535
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:08,745
he did it all around here.

536
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:13,250
Now, listen. I know that Larson
is still working this case.

537
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,485
So I'd like
the two of you to bring him in.

538
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:16,753
And I'd like the two of you

539
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,221
to go get
the other two brothers.

540
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,590
Please, okay? Thank you.

541
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,059
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

542
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,327
Abrams get a haircut, all right?
Jesus Christ.

543
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,796
Yeah.

544
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:34,504
Hey.
Has my partner been in today?

545
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:35,772
- Larson?
- Yeah.

546
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,140
No,
I haven't seen him yet.

547
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:39,176
Okay, can I give you my number?

548
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:42,279
- Sure.
- If he shows up...

549
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:43,747
- can you give me a call?
- Yeah, you bet.

550
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:44,815
Thanks.

551
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,151
Larson.

552
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:51,721
Larson!

553
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,093
Where the hell are you?

554
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,136
Larson!

555
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:34,464
Those poor kids.

556
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:38,201
Jesus.

557
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:16,840
I could have
blown your head off.

558
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:21,678
Oh, my god.

559
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,519
Why all the secrecy?

560
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:31,288
Thank you.

561
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,760
Make yourself at home.

562
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,963
Hey, what's up
with your phone?

563
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,397
I've been trying to call you
all day, I was worried.

564
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:43,900
It's dead.

565
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:47,804
Why don't you
lock your door?

566
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:49,806
I did.

567
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,374
Well, then you need to get
a better lock.

568
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:55,679
Did you go to the motel?

569
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,282
Yeah.

570
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:01,218
And?

571
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,620
I found a fingernail
under the bed

572
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:05,222
- in Josh Ridley's room.
- Oh, fuck!

573
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:06,489
Oh, fuck!

574
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,696
It's happening again.
Whitley has him.

575
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,799
We'll find him.

576
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,266
Uh, you need to tell me
where the other boys are

577
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,453
so that we can help.

578
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:21,638
Why am I not
on this case, Erica, huh?

579
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,940
It is fucking bullshit,
I am the only one--

580
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:25,675
We're all here
trying to solve this.

581
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:27,377
We're all trying
to catch him, okay?

582
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:28,979
You had me taken off the case,
didn't you?

583
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:30,347
Why would I do that?

584
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:31,648
You come into this town,

585
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,751
and you start planting seeds
in Parker's head.

586
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,519
Okay, that's why
this can't work.

587
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:39,606
You need to leave.

588
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:40,389
Get out!

589
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,596
I'll fucking go. I'm gonna go.

590
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:49,666
- You want me to go?
- Yes.

591
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:52,569
You want me to go?

592
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:30,440
Brian, are we gonna
make it out of here?

593
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:33,710
Everything's gonna be okay.

594
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:35,645
Hear that?

595
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:41,918
Oh, god.

596
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:03,973
Brian! Brian, Brian!

597
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:06,509
It's okay, it's okay.

598
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,945
You're here with me.
You're okay, you're okay.

599
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:11,114
You're safe, okay?

600
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:14,417
I'm here with you. I got you.
I got you, I got you.

601
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:16,586
I got you.

602
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:18,455
You're okay,
you're safe.

603
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:20,140
It's okay, sweetheart.

604
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:21,824
I know what you're feeling.
I know what's happening.

605
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:22,926
This happens to me sometimes.

606
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:24,694
It used to happen to me
all the time.

607
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:26,996
Right when I got back.

608
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:31,634
Remember, you wanted to know...

609
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:34,938
why I left the military.

610
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,072
Yeah.

611
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:38,475
You know,
where we were stationed,

612
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:40,443
we were basically peacekeepers.

613
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:44,981
You know, we dig wells, and...

614
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:48,651
help the village people, kinda,
build up an infrastructure.

615
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,056
We, we helped them
set-up a preschool.

616
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,026
I used to play
with all the kids.

617
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,564
There's one, one little boy
in particular.

618
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,932
His name was Afjah.

619
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:05,869
Which means "most beautiful".

620
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:08,538
He was so funny.

621
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:13,476
We used to kick around
a soccer ball.

622
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:15,445
We didn't really speak,
just like,

623
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,480
we'd teach each other
a few words.

624
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:21,017
The next week
we got credible intel,

625
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:24,020
that there was an insurgent cell
at this one address,

626
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:26,956
and near certainty
that the target was there

627
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,725
and there would be
no civilian casualties.

628
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:30,794
So, the next morning,

629
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:33,430
when it... when it was time
for us to, um...

630
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:37,901
to go and, you know,
clean everything up.

631
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:39,803
And, you know, follow, um...

632
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,876
It was, it was...

633
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,647
It was Afjah's house.

634
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:56,786
And I, I...

635
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,856
I found him in the rubble.

636
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:01,758
His little body.

637
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,160
His eyes were wide open.

638
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:07,730
I killed him. I... killed him.

639
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,944
I just... I, I...

640
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:23,580
For the longest time, I just,
every night I would wake up

641
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:25,882
and I would, I would...
I would see his face.

642
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:29,118
It, it gets better.

643
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,520
It'll get better. It's...

644
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:33,523
Fewer and fewer times.

645
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:35,258
It's not happening
very much anymore.

646
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:44,567
I'll be here for you.
I'll help you through it.

647
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,696
You look like shit, man.

648
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:17,133
What's up?

649
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,771
- Fridge?
- Yeah.

650
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:27,043
I don't understand
how this can happen, you know?

651
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,782
Why isn't Whitley dead?

652
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:35,084
Well, because...

653
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:36,686
...we had a shit prosecutor.

654
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:38,121
A shit legal system.

655
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:44,711
Yeah.

656
00:42:44,712 --> 00:42:45,728
Hey, I got a question
for you. Uh...

657
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,232
Has Josh called you?

658
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:52,569
No. You?

659
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:54,137
Uh-uh.

660
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:57,707
No, I went to Jones' Bar, and...

661
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,977
- Yeah.
- ...he was there two nights ago.

662
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:02,245
He left with a hooker.

663
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,180
And he ended up
in a motel off of 48.

664
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:21,998
- Bro.
- Hm?

665
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:25,168
You're on the case though,
right?

666
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,606
Temporarily reassigned.

667
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:38,314
How are you doing, kid?

668
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:42,218
- Staying afloat.
- Yeah?

669
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,156
Why don't you take me up
on my offer

670
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:49,208
to go back to school?

671
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,259
I mean, you're wasting your time
at that restaurant.

672
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:52,328
It's probably not the day

673
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,063
to have
a big brother conversation.

674
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:01,771
You're right.

675
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,149
Do you got a light?

676
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:15,918
Huh?

677
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:20,256
Thanks, buddy.

678
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,200
Oh, man.

679
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:33,269
Have you talked to,
have you talked to Georgie?

680
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:36,973
No.

681
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,810
I haven't heard from him
in years, man.

682
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:20,817
Rise and shine, buddy.

683
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:24,954
Thanks, man.

684
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:27,190
A little hangover cure.

685
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:30,059
Thank you, Matt.

686
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:35,898
You sleep all right?

687
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:38,968
No, my neck, it's...

688
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,270
Sorry.

689
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:43,072
Like Old Bob.

690
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,873
<i> We've been</i>
<i>notified that James Whitley</i>

691
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:47,110
<i>is one of the convicts
that escaped.</i>

692
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:49,479
<i>You might remember
the horrific story of Whitley.</i>

693
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:51,848
<i>Who wreaked havoc
on our small town</i>

694
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,349
<i>almost 30 years ago.</i>

695
00:45:54,152 --> 00:45:55,852
Oh, shit!

696
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:59,155
Shit! They leaked the pictures.

697
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:01,390
These sons of bitches
leaked the pictures!

698
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:03,059
Matt, get your keys!

699
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:04,127
Matt!

700
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:07,396
<i> Parker!</i>

701
00:46:11,136 --> 00:46:12,969
Hey. Hey, hey.

702
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:14,771
- You need to calm down.
- Hey, hey. Hey!

703
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:15,838
You need to calm down!

704
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,273
Hey,
he said calm down.

705
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:18,341
Okay, Larson.

706
00:46:18,343 --> 00:46:19,876
Out of my way.

707
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:21,310
Did you see
the news this morning?

708
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:23,446
Huh? Did you see
the news this morning?

709
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:25,214
Yes, I did.

710
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:27,016
This is the only office

711
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:29,018
where the press can get
those pictures from.

712
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,154
Why would I leak them?

713
00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:33,523
I don't know, Parker. Why?
Why the fuck would you do that?

714
00:46:33,525 --> 00:46:35,558
I think you're a stupid ass.

715
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,243
You've forgotten
what I did for you,

716
00:46:37,244 --> 00:46:38,927
and I'm gonna tell you
something right now.

717
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,496
You got ten seconds
to make a U-turn,

718
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:43,166
or put your badge
and gun on the desk!

719
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:45,234
And get the fuck out of here.
Now!

720
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:53,910
I'm sorry.

721
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:57,947
Oh, Christ.

722
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:04,353
Oh, Jesus.

723
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:06,022
How the fuck did that happen?

724
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,169
What do you think?

725
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,207
I think Josh Ridley's dead.

726
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:26,275
Well, he could have ran off
with that prostitute.

727
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,945
Mm-hm. I think he's part
of Whitney's ritual.

728
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:31,013
What I'm fixated on,
is the fingernails.

729
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,550
You know, I just read an article

730
00:47:34,552 --> 00:47:37,019
that proposed, people
with reoccurring obsessions,

731
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:40,022
the most significant memories
often play out in their actions.

732
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,490
The fingernails,
it could be this...

733
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:44,260
mental marker. Some past trauma.

734
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:49,065
Hey, I've been meaning
to ask you.

735
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:50,132
Do you have any hobbies?

736
00:47:50,134 --> 00:47:51,367
No.

737
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,202
Everybody has a hobby.

738
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,904
It's personal.

739
00:47:54,906 --> 00:47:56,639
Come on. You know mine.

740
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:59,141
That's cause you like
talking about it.

741
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:01,477
Come on, I won't tell anyone.

742
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:02,612
I hunt birds.

743
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,315
Oh.

744
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:16,158
Josh was always
the ladies' man.

745
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,895
But he and Dana
were having a lot of...

746
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:22,098
issues lately, I'm sorry to say.

747
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,599
You know,
maybe he went to Vegas.

748
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:25,535
He's done that before.

749
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:27,470
We have reason to believe
that he is still in town.

750
00:48:27,472 --> 00:48:30,339
We just are having trouble
locating him.

751
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:32,275
You work with my Brian,
don't you?

752
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,610
He's my partner.

753
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:37,680
Well, I...

754
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:39,982
Oh, well, uh,
why don't you ask him?

755
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:41,517
I'm sure he can help.

756
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,219
He's currently on leave.

757
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:45,554
Well, listen.
If anybody can find Josh,

758
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:47,823
it's Brian.

759
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:50,091
He was always such a good
big brother, growing up.

760
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,194
And all his foster brothers
looked up to him.

761
00:48:58,069 --> 00:49:00,569
Do you mind
if ask about George Middleton?

762
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:02,405
We don't have
an address for him.

763
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:05,708
Oh, Georgie.

764
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:09,512
He was always so troubled.

765
00:49:10,715 --> 00:49:12,214
A lost soul.

766
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:19,322
And you know, he never really
accepted me as his mother.

767
00:49:21,426 --> 00:49:22,725
But I loved him.

768
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:27,296
I knew it was
just a matter of time

769
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,198
before he moved on.

770
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,133
It started when he was just, uh,

771
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,335
just a boy.

772
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:36,272
And then, it got really bad
in high school.

773
00:49:38,743 --> 00:49:40,743
His classmates would bully him,

774
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:43,579
and harass him.

775
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:48,551
And sometimes...

776
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:52,321
he would just run home
from school

777
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,390
and go straight to his room,
because...

778
00:49:55,393 --> 00:49:57,660
he didn't want me
to see his face.

779
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,099
Oh, thank you.

780
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:11,340
I will never forget
the day it happened.

781
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:14,010
The day Whitley
came into our lives.

782
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:21,617
There was a knock on the door.

783
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:24,553
<i> He introduced himself</i>
<i>and all.</i>

784
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:26,422
He was very polite.

785
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:28,657
Charismatic, even.

786
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:31,594
And he claimed to have worked
for social services.

787
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:35,064
<i> He even had</i>
<i>all the paperwork.</i>

788
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:37,767
And then, he wanted to speak
with all four boys.

789
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:43,305
There had been
some speculation that...

790
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:46,809
that I was mistreating
the boys, but...

791
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:50,780
...I would never lay
a hand on them.

792
00:50:50,782 --> 00:50:52,048
Never.

793
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:55,117
<i> And then...</i>

794
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:58,621
<i>he took them from me.</i>

795
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:02,725
<i>He took them.</i>

796
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:10,232
With James Whitley
being on the loose,

797
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,567
your foster children will be--

798
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,769
My children, Detective.

799
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:15,438
Mine.

800
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:19,708
What I meant to say is that,

801
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:22,478
just ascertaining
their whereabouts, their safety,

802
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,480
Perhaps, putting them
into protective custody

803
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:26,549
till this is all over.
That's, that's our goal.

804
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:31,287
Our records show
that George moved out...

805
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:32,788
when he became a legal adult?

806
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:35,591
Yeah. Right after
he dropped out of school.

807
00:51:38,362 --> 00:51:40,696
Do you have any way
of reaching out to him?

808
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:42,131
He did
mention something

809
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:43,599
the last time he wrote me.

810
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,501
He said he was living in a...

811
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:49,705
mobile home, an RV, or...

812
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:52,408
Or in a mobile park
or something.

813
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:56,846
But you know...

814
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:01,817
it's hard to find someone
who just doesn't wanna be found.

815
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:06,122
Thank you.

816
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:12,828
Hey, uh, I'd like you to run
a DMV database check for me.

817
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:15,598
See whether any RV
or mobile home

818
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,167
has been registered
to George Middleton, thanks.

819
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,413
<i> How are you dealing</i>
<i>with all this, Matty?</i>

820
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:32,915
I'm not doing good, man.

821
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:36,619
All this shit's coming back.

822
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:38,554
All the real bad shit.

823
00:52:41,726 --> 00:52:43,292
I'm scared.

824
00:52:43,294 --> 00:52:44,627
How about the girl?

825
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:46,629
Is she helping you?

826
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:48,931
We tried.

827
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:50,432
What do you mean
you tried?

828
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:52,401
Just... you just try harder,
actually.

829
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:57,907
You don't think
I don't want that?

830
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,510
To live happily ever after?

831
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:07,416
And not think about Whitley
and the cage he put me in?

832
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:08,817
We should not
talk about it.

833
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:11,654
He's coming for me.

834
00:53:11,656 --> 00:53:13,489
- I'm scared, Brian.
- It's okay.

835
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:14,823
- I'm scared.
- It's okay.

836
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:16,859
Hey, it's okay.

837
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,627
It's okay.

838
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:21,230
He ruined me, man.

839
00:53:21,232 --> 00:53:22,398
He ruined me.

840
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:24,567
Hey.

841
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,404
Uh.

842
00:53:30,274 --> 00:53:32,641
Hey, Erica.
This is my baby brother.

843
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:34,243
This is Matt.

844
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:36,478
Matt, this is my partner,
Erica Shotwell.

845
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:41,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

846
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:43,252
- Good to meet you.
- You too, Erica.

847
00:53:43,254 --> 00:53:44,653
Hey.

848
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,222
It's Mom.

849
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:47,590
I gotta take this.

850
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:49,325
Sure.

851
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:50,659
I'll give you guys
a minute.

852
00:53:53,965 --> 00:53:55,431
Hey.

853
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:56,599
He seems sweet.

854
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:01,837
- You okay?
- Yeah.

855
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,673
You know, you look pretty.

856
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:07,610
Thank you.

857
00:54:07,612 --> 00:54:09,712
Hey, you shoulda
let me know that you had Matt,

858
00:54:09,714 --> 00:54:11,814
I've been searching
all over for him today.

859
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:14,316
You should let Parker know.

860
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:17,953
We don't have much
on George yet,

861
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:19,755
but I've been put in charge
of finding

862
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,423
- all the boys--
- I've got Matt.

863
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,859
I'm gonna go get George,
and I'll bring him in.

864
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:25,794
Okay?

865
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:27,363
But, Brian,
maybe it'd be good if,

866
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:29,382
if you let
other people help you.

867
00:54:29,383 --> 00:54:31,400
I will call you. You will be
the first person that I call.

868
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:32,534
I promise you that.

869
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:34,270
Okay?

870
00:54:34,272 --> 00:54:35,938
I'll bring us in.
We'll all come in.

871
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:42,978
Okay.

872
00:54:50,554 --> 00:54:52,855
Ken, I need one more.

873
00:54:52,857 --> 00:54:54,290
One more.

874
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:58,727
Thanks.

875
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:16,345
Who is that, man?

876
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:17,680
Who keeps calling you?

877
00:55:17,682 --> 00:55:19,348
I don't know, man.

878
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,015
You know, that's the same thing
that woke me up this morning.

879
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:22,785
Who is that?

880
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:24,553
I don't know,
I've just been ignoring it.

881
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:25,954
Who the fuck is this?

882
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:29,391
George?

883
00:55:29,393 --> 00:55:30,826
You little weirdo.

884
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,929
George.

885
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:36,065
Buddy, yeah.

886
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:38,067
Yeah, we'll come over.
We're looking for you.

887
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:40,562
<i>Shotwell.</i>

888
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,664
Captain, I'm on him now, but...

889
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:44,066
Is this really necessary?

890
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:45,618
I understand.

891
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:47,169
You feel like
you're violating his trust.

892
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:49,405
What I want you to do,
is get eyes on Middleton,

893
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,039
as soon as you do,
you let me know.

894
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:52,775
Very good, sir.

895
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:57,880
You really think
Larson's hiding something?

896
00:57:05,022 --> 00:57:07,623
All right. Keep going,
let's lose them.

897
00:57:22,907 --> 00:57:24,907
We're close. Point three miles.

898
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,746
Oh, shit.

899
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:33,749
Where'd they go?

900
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:35,150
All right. Turn left up here.

901
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:42,825
What are you writing?

902
00:57:43,994 --> 00:57:45,127
Observations.

903
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,029
On what?

904
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,466
Our pursuit.

905
00:58:46,624 --> 00:58:47,890
<i> Brian.</i>

906
00:58:47,892 --> 00:58:49,591
Listen to me.

907
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:51,226
You gotta come in, okay?

908
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:53,996
I can't protect you
while you're out there.

909
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:55,631
<i>So please, come in.</i>

910
00:58:55,633 --> 00:58:56,765
Call me right away.

911
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:02,905
This is it.

912
00:59:06,644 --> 00:59:07,876
Talk about hidden.

913
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:13,115
What is he doing out here?

914
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:28,230
Hey, George?

915
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:33,969
You sure this is him?

916
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:46,348
Hey, Georgie.

917
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:48,850
It's good to see you guys.

918
00:59:58,162 --> 00:59:59,227
Hey, pal.

919
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:01,897
Hey, pal.

920
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:08,337
You wanna--
Come on inside.

921
01:00:20,017 --> 01:00:22,317
Wow, jeez, Georgie.
You could use a maid.

922
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:23,685
And a gardener.

923
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:26,688
Have a seat.

924
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:28,824
Um, where are we
supposed to sit, pal?

925
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:53,315
Thanks, George.

926
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:57,419
Hey, George.

927
01:00:57,921 --> 01:00:59,438
Thanks.

928
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:00,956
Let me get you
guys some drinks.

929
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:02,290
Great. Thanks, buddy.

930
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:22,144
So, how you've been,
Georgie?

931
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:25,047
Uh, real good.

932
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:37,125
All right.

933
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:38,760
- Thanks, George.
- Now, um...

934
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:41,763
Cheers.

935
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:51,840
Wow.

936
01:01:52,276 --> 01:01:53,375
Thanks, Georgie.

937
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,816
I spoke to Ma.

938
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:02,217
She's worried about you.

939
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:05,253
Why do you still call her that?

940
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:07,155
Come on, man. She's our mom.

941
01:02:07,157 --> 01:02:08,390
Hey.

942
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:09,925
Nadine was good to us.

943
01:02:09,927 --> 01:02:11,893
We were lucky
to have her in our lives.

944
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:17,299
Sorry.

945
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,333
I just heard the news
about Pendleton.

946
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:20,936
This is what we're gonna do.

947
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:22,437
We're gonna stick together
until they catch Whitley.

948
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:24,339
Well, you mentioned...

949
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:27,075
that Josh may have gone missing?

950
01:02:28,312 --> 01:02:29,377
Yeah.

951
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:30,879
Two nights ago.

952
01:02:34,118 --> 01:02:35,817
What are you talking about?

953
01:02:37,821 --> 01:02:41,456
My partner found something
in the motel off of 48.

954
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:42,758
What did they find?

955
01:02:47,297 --> 01:02:48,997
A fingernail.

956
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:50,582
Why didn't you
tell me that, bro?

957
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:52,166
Because, Matt, you know
that I can't talk about

958
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:53,468
an ongoing investigation.

959
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:02,778
You said your partner found it?

960
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:06,348
Yeah, um...

961
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:11,953
My partner,
the bird-loving shit for brain.

962
01:03:16,026 --> 01:03:18,160
Do you get...

963
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:19,461
I'm gonna use
your toilet, Georgie.

964
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:55,163
Why did you leave us, George?

965
01:03:57,201 --> 01:04:00,001
Do I really need to answer
that question?

966
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,269
We grew up together, man.

967
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:03,471
We were... we were brothers.

968
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:05,974
Then you turned 18,
and you just disappeared on us.

969
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,310
All people move on.

970
01:04:09,313 --> 01:04:11,479
Things change.

971
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:13,849
I didn't see you
trying to find me.

972
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:15,984
George, I meant...

973
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:19,855
Did you know
that an adult lion...

974
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:23,258
will eat the cubs that aren't
in the direct bloodline?

975
01:04:24,228 --> 01:04:25,427
It's true.

976
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,431
You know why they do that?

977
01:04:31,435 --> 01:04:34,336
Because, they're afraid...

978
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:37,906
that if the cubs grow up,

979
01:04:37,908 --> 01:04:40,108
they'll eat the father,

980
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:42,310
and impregnate the mother.

981
01:04:43,547 --> 01:04:44,980
What?

982
01:04:46,116 --> 01:04:47,916
And then I realized...

983
01:04:49,253 --> 01:04:51,119
that we are those cubs.

984
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:54,256
You.

985
01:04:55,259 --> 01:04:56,491
Me.

986
01:04:58,662 --> 01:05:00,395
I'm back. We gotta go--

987
01:05:02,499 --> 01:05:04,666
Our brother, the drunk.

988
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:09,070
Born into fear.

989
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:12,107
Afraid of what our
foster parents might do to us.

990
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:15,911
Afraid
they might view us...

991
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:17,045
as a threat.

992
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,684
It took me a really long time...

993
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,020
to realize...

994
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:27,522
that he was right.

995
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:31,359
He really was trying to save us.

996
01:05:33,497 --> 01:05:35,563
I made a deal, Matthew.

997
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:39,367
What?

998
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:42,003
Everything
is gonna be fine.

999
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:45,006
He's gonna send us
to see our real parents.

1000
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:57,686
Are you positive?

1001
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:00,722
When?

1002
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:03,291
Okay, text it to me as soon
as you got it, all right?

1003
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,392
Thanks.

1004
01:06:14,538 --> 01:06:15,704
Oh, god.

1005
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:23,545
Wait. This is why
you had me stop here?

1006
01:06:26,249 --> 01:06:27,515
My other one broke.

1007
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:31,653
Jesus Christ.

1008
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:33,221
Fucking beats them all.

1009
01:06:33,223 --> 01:06:34,322
It's a goldfinch.

1010
01:06:36,293 --> 01:06:37,793
Shit.

1011
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:47,402
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

1012
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:53,575
Where'd you find it?

1013
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:55,210
Sittin' on
the side of the road.

1014
01:06:55,212 --> 01:06:57,012
Like, a couple miles back.

1015
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:59,481
- Ha.
- Gas tank was empty.

1016
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:02,083
Sure looks like the one
that was at the gas station.

1017
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:03,151
- What was that?
- Yeah.

1018
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:04,619
Oh, nothing.

1019
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:10,225
Whoa.

1020
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:17,098
Got anything interesting
up there?

1021
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,466
Well, I need to look through.

1022
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:26,741
Huh.

1023
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:39,421
Shotwell.

1024
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,194
Okay. Thank you. Crap.

1025
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:50,799
Thanks.

1026
01:07:51,768 --> 01:07:53,635
Abrams?

1027
01:07:53,637 --> 01:07:55,887
Yeah?

1028
01:07:55,888 --> 01:07:58,138
Results say the fingernail
matched to Josh Ridley.

1029
01:07:58,141 --> 01:08:00,442
- What about the rest of him?
- You guys want an apple?

1030
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:02,143
Oh, I'm good, thanks.

1031
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:03,578
Yeah, sure. I'll take one.

1032
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:05,647
Oh.

1033
01:08:05,649 --> 01:08:08,083
It's the best harvest we've had
since the fire.

1034
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:09,317
What fire?

1035
01:08:09,319 --> 01:08:10,785
You know. The Bly place.

1036
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:16,791
We have to go. Come on.
Thank you.

1037
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:18,093
- Good bye.
- Sure.

1038
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:22,130
This is the transcript
of Whitley's interrogation.

1039
01:08:22,132 --> 01:08:24,182
Look here.

1040
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:26,233
He sees foster parents
as an abomination.

1041
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:27,802
Then, there's the time of year.

1042
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:30,138
Look at the leaves,
early September,

1043
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:31,739
to late November. What is that?

1044
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:34,442
Harvest season.

1045
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:36,845
Right.

1046
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,247
Okay, Abrams. What kind of trees
are these saplings?

1047
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:44,352
Malus Domestica Braeburn.

1048
01:08:44,354 --> 01:08:48,223
And what's the only orchard
in Julian, that grows Braeburns?

1049
01:08:48,225 --> 01:08:49,357
Bly's orchard.

1050
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:29,664
Matt.

1051
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:19,314
Whoa.

1052
01:10:34,798 --> 01:10:36,397
George.

1053
01:10:37,234 --> 01:10:38,666
Help me.

1054
01:10:39,502 --> 01:10:41,369
George!

1055
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:17,972
No.

1056
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:47,902
It's okay, Brian.

1057
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:49,971
George. Georgie.

1058
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:51,939
This is how it's supposed to be.

1059
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:01,516
You know, Nadine...

1060
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,385
we were just...

1061
01:12:05,422 --> 01:12:08,356
distractions from her pathetic,

1062
01:12:08,358 --> 01:12:09,991
meaningless life.

1063
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,096
We were never supposed
to be with her.

1064
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:17,932
Georgie.

1065
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:19,767
I'm your family.

1066
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:21,502
I am your family.
I am your big brother.

1067
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:23,037
And you're
my little brother, George.

1068
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,505
And we're all we got.

1069
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:25,907
Hey. Hey.

1070
01:12:27,444 --> 01:12:28,810
We're all we got.

1071
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:33,514
We got to...

1072
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:35,650
We got to stick together
so that we can be strong,

1073
01:12:35,652 --> 01:12:37,885
so we can survive.

1074
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:40,388
Look, he's using you, Georgie.
He's using you.

1075
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:42,423
And now, I want you to untie me.

1076
01:12:42,425 --> 01:12:44,659
Georgie. Georgie.

1077
01:12:44,661 --> 01:12:45,860
Untie me.

1078
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:49,764
Untie me.

1079
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:54,836
No! No!

1080
01:12:58,641 --> 01:12:59,707
Shut up.

1081
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,544
George.

1082
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:06,581
Would you be so kind
as to bring the shovel?

1083
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:10,084
George!

1084
01:13:11,121 --> 01:13:12,553
George!

1085
01:13:13,456 --> 01:13:14,522
Fuck!

1086
01:13:21,747 --> 01:13:22,529
I know
what you're thinking.

1087
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,665
Hm.

1088
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:28,936
The Phantom and his opera.

1089
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,541
No.

1090
01:13:34,711 --> 01:13:36,644
It's not for me.

1091
01:13:36,646 --> 01:13:38,646
I don't even like
classical music.

1092
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:40,648
No.

1093
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:43,885
It's for you.

1094
01:13:45,989 --> 01:13:47,188
It's for all of you.

1095
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,992
A clarion's call.

1096
01:13:50,994 --> 01:13:53,027
For an usher
to the other side.

1097
01:13:56,866 --> 01:13:58,199
Hey, hey, hey.

1098
01:13:58,201 --> 01:13:59,467
Hey.

1099
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:02,570
George knows.

1100
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:06,140
See...

1101
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:10,044
George is the only one of you
who wrote me

1102
01:14:10,046 --> 01:14:12,747
while I was away.

1103
01:14:16,753 --> 01:14:19,053
See, I knew...

1104
01:14:19,055 --> 01:14:20,855
I knew that his suffering...

1105
01:14:22,725 --> 01:14:23,991
was your suffering.

1106
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:29,697
My dear Brian.

1107
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:31,499
Sweet Brian.

1108
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:33,868
I failed you.

1109
01:14:35,905 --> 01:14:38,139
I failed all of you.

1110
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:40,074
But, hey...

1111
01:14:40,076 --> 01:14:43,611
Hey!

1112
01:14:44,614 --> 01:14:45,880
It starts with...

1113
01:14:45,882 --> 01:14:48,082
with one single sore.

1114
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:52,920
Whitley!

1115
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:54,155
Ah!

1116
01:14:56,926 --> 01:14:59,126
Oh, my god. Oh, Brian.

1117
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:04,632
Hold still, hold still.

1118
01:15:04,634 --> 01:15:05,900
Ah.

1119
01:15:05,902 --> 01:15:08,503
Oh, Jesus.

1120
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:09,804
Oh, my god.

1121
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:14,742
Are you all right?

1122
01:15:14,744 --> 01:15:16,544
- Are you okay?
- Matt?

1123
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:18,246
Matt!

1124
01:15:19,782 --> 01:15:22,283
- No. No.
- I'm so sorry.

1125
01:15:22,285 --> 01:15:23,952
- You gotta go get him.
- I'm sorry.

1126
01:15:23,953 --> 01:15:25,620
- You're gonna be all right?
- I'm okay.

1127
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:27,054
I got Larson.

1128
01:15:27,056 --> 01:15:28,523
Are you all right?

1129
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:30,057
You all right? You need help?

1130
01:15:30,059 --> 01:15:31,125
- Hold on.
- Help me up.

1131
01:15:55,685 --> 01:15:57,618
Hey, here. Lean back, lean back.

1132
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:48,336
Oh, come on, please.

1133
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:07,955
I almost saved them all.

1134
01:17:10,693 --> 01:17:12,259
You'll never save them.

1135
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:44,392
No, he's okay.

1136
01:17:44,394 --> 01:17:46,260
Something did knock him out
for a while.

1137
01:17:46,262 --> 01:17:48,396
- Could be the sodium pentothal.
- Meaning?

1138
01:17:48,398 --> 01:17:49,864
It's part of the cocktail.

1139
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:51,198
He's gonna be all right?

1140
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,266
Yeah.

1141
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:54,402
- Absolutely.
- Excuse me.

1142
01:17:54,404 --> 01:17:55,770
Thank god.

1143
01:17:55,772 --> 01:17:56,837
Thanks.

1144
01:17:59,142 --> 01:18:01,442
Parker wants this area swept
and everything cataloged.

1145
01:18:01,444 --> 01:18:03,144
The thing is,

1146
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,845
the Feds are taking over
on anything involving Whitley.

1147
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,214
You know, I have, uh,

1148
01:18:07,216 --> 01:18:09,083
- theory on all of this.
- Abrams.

1149
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:13,854
You know what, I'll let you know
how it pans out.

1150
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:15,756
Thanks.

1151
01:18:59,168 --> 01:19:00,234
All right.

1152
01:19:16,452 --> 01:19:17,852
Rose.

1153
01:19:17,854 --> 01:19:19,286
You're too late.

1154
01:19:19,288 --> 01:19:21,455
Pardon?

1155
01:19:21,457 --> 01:19:24,825
I already gave my statement
to another detective.

1156
01:19:24,827 --> 01:19:26,961
Oh, no. I, um...

1157
01:19:26,963 --> 01:19:29,163
Good. No, I just wanted to...

1158
01:19:29,165 --> 01:19:32,032
with everything going on,
make sure that you're okay.

1159
01:19:34,804 --> 01:19:36,470
Uh, if, if...

1160
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:38,038
If you have any...

1161
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,241
questions or you need anything,

1162
01:19:40,243 --> 01:19:43,077
this, you can--
This is my number.

1163
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:47,014
Oh, I...

1164
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:48,449
I didn't see that before.

1165
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:50,451
I didn't realize
there was a mister.

1166
01:19:50,453 --> 01:19:52,119
Bly.

1167
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:53,220
Yeah.

1168
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:56,257
He died in a fire.

1169
01:19:57,894 --> 01:19:59,059
Bly's Orchard?

1170
01:20:02,165 --> 01:20:03,230
Oh.

1171
01:20:04,066 --> 01:20:06,233
You know,

1172
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,401
there's gonna be
a huge migration leaving soon.

1173
01:20:09,839 --> 01:20:11,505
Should be quite a sight.

1174
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:13,974
Uh-huh.

1175
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:16,310
Okay, um, we might in, uh...

1176
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:18,946
coming days need to tape off
some of the...

1177
01:20:18,948 --> 01:20:21,115
surrounding areas, but, uh...

1178
01:20:21,117 --> 01:20:23,184
Okay, thanks.

1179
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:29,290
Let's wrap it up.

1180
01:20:35,364 --> 01:20:37,264
We found some blood in the soil
deeper in the orchard,

1181
01:20:37,266 --> 01:20:38,933
but uh, no body.

1182
01:20:39,468 --> 01:20:40,534
Hm.

1183
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:44,104
I guess we're not out
of the woods yet.

1184
01:20:47,443 --> 01:20:48,943
See you back at the station.

1185
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:51,378
Boys. Let's move out.

1186
01:20:52,615 --> 01:20:53,881
Yeah.

1187
01:20:59,088 --> 01:21:00,287
There's blood?

1188
01:21:39,996 --> 01:21:41,362
Ah.

1189
01:22:45,261 --> 01:22:46,593
Oh, shit.

1190
01:22:54,337 --> 01:22:55,402
