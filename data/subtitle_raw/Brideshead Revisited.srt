1
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,094
If you asked me now who I am,

2
00:01:00,504 --> 00:01:02,369
the only answer I could give
with any certainty

3
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:05,584
would be my name,
Charles Ryder.

4
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,347
For the rest,
my loves, my hates,

5
00:01:11,415 --> 00:01:14,145
down even to my deepest desires,

6
00:01:14,217 --> 00:01:17,482
I can no longer say whether
these emotions are my own

7
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:22,583
or stolen from those
I once so desperately wished to be.

8
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:29,323
On second thoughts,
one emotion remains my own,

9
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,863
alone among the borrowed
and the second-hand,

10
00:01:35,372 --> 00:01:38,830
as pure as that faith
from which I am still in flight.

11
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:42,906
Guilt.

12
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:10,373
Been away, sir? Anywhere interesting?

13
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,466
- Jungle.
- Jungle.

14
00:02:15,078 --> 00:02:16,238
Explorer, are we?

15
00:02:16,313 --> 00:02:19,146
- Painter.
- Painter?

16
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:22,344
So, bye-bye beardy, hello smooth.

17
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:37,857
Famous for his impressive
architectural portraits,

18
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:42,268
British artist Charles Ryder
has taken New York by storm

19
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:45,239
with a series of gripping jungle studies.

20
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:46,935
To own a Ryder is currently the dream

21
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,807
of every self-respecting
East Coast millionaire.

22
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,744
You must be so proud of him.

23
00:02:52,816 --> 00:02:55,341
- Was he away long?
- Two years,

24
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:59,377
- and it doesn't feel like a day.
- You must feel positively bridal.

25
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:02,086
I can't paint
to save my life.

26
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,183
Thank you.

27
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,626
I can't even hold a buggering brush!

28
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:11,964
But I know what I like. Lots of color.
Nice and bright.

29
00:03:12,035 --> 00:03:15,198
I see the jungle in your work
as a metaphor.

30
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:20,333
Not least, the metaphysical semblance
of the chaos at the heart of civilization.

31
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,241
Make an effort, Charles.

32
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:26,305
You're not in South America now.
You're amongst civilized people.

33
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,690
- Mr. Ryder, I wonder if I could...
- I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

34
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:10,988
- Excuse me. Thank you very much.
... just have a conversation...

35
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:28,995
Hello, Charles.

36
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,386
- You're wearing a coat!
- Yes, Father, I am.

37
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:28,363
Why?

38
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:31,923
- I'm going up to Oxford.
- Ah. Yes.

39
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,633
- Remind me. What are you taking?
- History.

40
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,802
- And what allowance have I given you?
- A hundred pounds.

41
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:45,871
How very indulgent of me.
Mind you, it all comes out of capital.

42
00:06:47,684 --> 00:06:51,211
Oh, I suppose this is the time
I should give you advice.

43
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,418
Your mother was always
so good at that.

44
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:00,460
Who's meeting you?

45
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,361
Cousin Jasper offered
to show me around.

46
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:03,990
Cousin Jasper!

47
00:07:05,902 --> 00:07:07,836
Most entertaining.

48
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:50,277
Out of the way,
you silly fool.

49
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:52,405
There you are, Charles.

50
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:54,910
This way, please.

51
00:07:57,487 --> 00:08:01,685
Come along. As an only child,
you will, of course, have much to learn.

52
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:05,421
Though I am only your cousin, Charles,
you must look upon me as a brother.

53
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:08,362
Older, wiser,
but a brother nevertheless.

54
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:12,458
Now, it is no secret that our families
are not rich in material wealth.

55
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:13,866
Keep off the grass.

56
00:08:13,937 --> 00:08:19,603
But I like to think that we Ryders are,
all of us, rich in the striving of minds.

57
00:08:19,676 --> 00:08:21,234
Now, then... Not that way.

58
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:24,872
Clothes. Dress as you do
in a country house.

59
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:28,543
Never wear a tweed coat
and a flannel trousers, always a suit.

60
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:31,086
And go to a London tailor.
You'll get a better cut.

61
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:34,783
Protocol. First and foremost,
behaving with restraint...

62
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:40,660
Nine adulteries, 12 liaisons,
64 fornications,

63
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,164
and something approaching a rape

64
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:48,637
rest nightly upon the soul
of our delicate friend Florialis,

65
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:51,538
and yet the man is so
quiet and reserved in demeanor

66
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:55,476
that he passes
for both bloodless and sexless.

67
00:08:58,715 --> 00:09:02,378
Sodomites, all of them. Steer well clear.

68
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:07,916
Treat all dons
as you would the local vicar.

69
00:09:07,991 --> 00:09:10,050
With indifference.

70
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:14,790
Oh, dear, oh, dear. This won't do at all.
You must change your rooms.

71
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:16,764
I've seen many a man ruined

72
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,996
through having ground floor rooms
in the front quad.

73
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:21,627
People start dropping in.

74
00:09:21,704 --> 00:09:24,832
They leave their gowns here
and come and collect them before hall.

75
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:27,775
You start giving them sherry
and before you know it they're...

76
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:36,552
Sebastian, come along.
Look at the state of him.

77
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:38,610
Come on, you're nearly clean.

78
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:48,657
Oh, no, no, no, sir, stop.

79
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:52,223
You don't clear up after yourself.
That's my job.

80
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:55,271
Sorry, Lunt. What's all this?

81
00:09:55,338 --> 00:10:00,640
From the gentleman last night, sir.
He just called. Left a note for you.

82
00:10:07,283 --> 00:10:08,614
"I am very contrite.

83
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:12,177
"Please come to luncheon today.
Sebastian Flyte."

84
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:15,224
The Lord Sebastian Flyte,
don't you know?

85
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:18,783
I'm sure it's quite a pleasure
to clear up after him.

86
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:22,296
I take it
you'll be out to lunch today, then, sir.

87
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:25,459
Yes, Lunt. I think I shall be.

88
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:10,445
I've just counted them.

89
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:14,074
There's five each and two over,
so I'm having the two.

90
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:18,283
I'm unaccountably hungry today.

91
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:21,446
I put myself unreservedly
in the hands of Dolbear and Goodall

92
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:23,253
and feel so drugged
I've begun to believe

93
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:26,192
the whole of yesterday evening
was a dream.

94
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:29,263
Please don't wake me.

95
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:32,824
- Do try one.
- Thank you.

96
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:37,695
- What are they?
- Plover's eggs. The first this year.

97
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:43,509
Mummy sends them from Brideshead.
They always lay early for her.

98
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:46,275
You would, too, if you knew my mother.

99
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:51,580
Are you terribly angry with me
about last night?

100
00:11:51,654 --> 00:11:55,886
No, not at all.
Thank you for the flowers.

101
00:11:58,127 --> 00:12:01,927
Aloysius, you can't go there.
Do sit down.

102
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:11,632
- Tell me about you.
- Me?

103
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:16,136
I'm in my first year, reading history,

104
00:12:18,247 --> 00:12:21,614
but really what I most want to be
is a painter.

105
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:23,811
Would you like to paint me?

106
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:29,346
Well, yes. Yes, if you like.

107
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:31,416
It's so clever of you,
knowing what you want.

108
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:33,792
I've no idea what I want.

109
00:12:33,863 --> 00:12:35,626
Except to be happy.

110
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,122
If I can.

111
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:40,260
Let's have some champagne.

112
00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:44,000
A glass each before the rowdies arrive.

113
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:51,203
You don't want to join the Old Boys.

114
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,148
They're all bloody drugged bogs
or collegers.

115
00:12:55,218 --> 00:12:56,879
Top me up,
will you, old man?

116
00:12:56,953 --> 00:13:00,116
- I don't remember you from Eton.
- I didn't go to Eton.

117
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:04,523
Oh, really. Where then?
Harrow or Winchester?

118
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,459
Rugby? Oh, not Charterhouse, I hope?

119
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:12,290
You wouldn't have heard of it.

120
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:14,268
There are other schools,
you know, Boy.

121
00:13:14,337 --> 00:13:16,805
Yes, I suppose there must be.

122
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:21,638
- My dears.
- Hello, Blanche.

123
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:22,905
Hello, Blanche.

124
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:24,537
I couldn't get away before.

125
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:28,209
I was lunching
with my preposterous tutor.

126
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:32,220
I told him I had to change for footer.

127
00:13:39,228 --> 00:13:42,925
Anthony, you remember Charles.
From last night?

128
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:45,559
Charles is reading history,
but he wants to be an artist.

129
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:48,263
- No!
- Why ever not?

130
00:13:48,337 --> 00:13:51,704
- Either you are an artist or you are not.
- Hear, hear.

131
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:57,537
- Then I am.
- Interesting.

132
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:01,946
You have about you
a distinct hint of the pragmatic.

133
00:14:02,018 --> 00:14:05,715
What do you want to be an artist for?
I mean, what's the point of it?

134
00:14:05,788 --> 00:14:07,881
Why don't you just
buy a bloody camera

135
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:10,755
and take a bloody photograph
and stop giving yourself airs?

136
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:13,489
- That's what I want to know!
- That's it, go it, Boy!

137
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:16,964
- I don't give myself airs.
- Yes, you do.

138
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:19,968
And, anyway,
you haven't answered my question.

139
00:14:20,036 --> 00:14:21,765
Come on! Answer!

140
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:26,139
- Answer, answer, answer, answer...
- Yes.

141
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:28,541
Answer, answer, answer, answer...

142
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:34,106
Because a camera
is a mechanical device

143
00:14:34,183 --> 00:14:36,981
which records a moment in time,

144
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:42,114
but not what that moment means
or the emotions that it evokes.

145
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:48,525
Whereas a painting,
however imperfect it may be,

146
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:52,460
is an expression of feeling.

147
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,270
An expression of love.

148
00:14:57,807 --> 00:15:00,002
Not just a copy of something.

149
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,839
And who on earth do you think
cares about your feelings?

150
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,349
I do.

151
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:11,978
Boy, you're an oaf. Behave yourself.

152
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:15,056
To art and love.

153
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,886
To art and love!

154
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:29,367
We'd just arrived in his rooms, then,
without even a, "By your leave,"

155
00:15:29,472 --> 00:15:33,306
the Lord Flyte pokes his head
through the window and vomits.

156
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,309
Ground floor rooms, you see.
Poor Charles may never recover.

157
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,439
- Morning, Jasper.
- Morning.

158
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:50,590
Two tries out of you today...

159
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,823
Charles. You're to come away at once!

160
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:56,797
I've got a basket of strawberries
and a bottle of Chateau Peyraguey,

161
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:59,391
which isn't a wine you've ever tasted,
so don't pretend.

162
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:01,698
It's heaven with strawberries.

163
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:24,353
Just the place to bury a crock of gold.

164
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:30,161
I should like to bury
something precious

165
00:16:30,232 --> 00:16:32,860
in every place where I've been happy.

166
00:16:34,403 --> 00:16:37,566
And, then,
when I was old and ugly and miserable,

167
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:45,312
I could come back
and dig it up and remember.

168
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,787
Come along, Charles.
There's someone I want you to meet.

169
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:34,326
- Is this where you live?
- It's where my family live.

170
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,862
Don't worry,
you won't have to meet them.

171
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:42,893
- Oh, but I should like to.
- You can't. They're away.

172
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:09,798
Everything's shut up.
We better go this way.

173
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:24,776
Keep up.

174
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:38,221
Charles. Charles.

175
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:54,635
Well, this is a surprise!
How lovely to see you.

176
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:58,640
Meet my new chum, Charles.

177
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:02,942
Charles, this is Nanny Hawkins.
This is who I wanted you to meet.

178
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:06,385
- I don't think I know you, do I?
- How do you do?

179
00:19:06,455 --> 00:19:10,585
Your friend has charming manners.
What family are you from, Charles?

180
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:14,288
- No family. I mean, no one important.
- Charles is an artist.

181
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:18,797
- He's going to paint me.
- How jolly.

182
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:22,260
You've come at just the right time.

183
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:24,431
Lady Marchmain's
on her way up from London.

184
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:26,702
It's the Conservative Women's Tea.

185
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:28,401
They always turn out for Brideshead.

186
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:31,105
I'm afraid we may have
to miss them, Nanny.

187
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,909
Your mother will be disappointed.

188
00:19:32,982 --> 00:19:34,711
I'm sure Her Ladyship
would want to meet...

189
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,719
Can't be done, I'm afraid.
Got to get back or we'll be gated.

190
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:49,758
I pray for my dear Sebastian every day.

191
00:19:52,268 --> 00:19:55,294
- Charles!
- It was very nice to meet you.

192
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:04,410
- Come along, Charles.
- Couldn't we just have a quick look?

193
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,209
We've seen who we came for.
We can go.

194
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:08,045
Just a little look.

195
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:47,480
Don't be such a tourist, Charles.

196
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:48,580
If you're that keen,

197
00:20:48,657 --> 00:20:52,354
you can see it all for a shilling
on Queen Alexandra's Day.

198
00:20:53,762 --> 00:20:55,923
God, I loathe that painting!

199
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:02,860
I could show you the chapel, I suppose,
if we're quick.

200
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:28,853
What did you do that for?

201
00:21:30,232 --> 00:21:32,894
- You're not Catholic, are you?
- No.

202
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:38,136
- I was just trying to fit in.
- Well, don't.

203
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:45,913
Come on, come on!

204
00:21:45,981 --> 00:21:47,005
Sorry, I'm afraid I don't have the knack.

205
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:49,209
Charles, what are you doing?

206
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:55,885
Car. Now.

207
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,559
Who was that in the car
with your mother?

208
00:22:31,627 --> 00:22:33,561
- My sister.
- What's she like?

209
00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:34,653
For goodness sake, Charles,

210
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,494
I don't keep asking you questions
about your family.

211
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:39,625
But I've never
asked you anything before.

212
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:41,533
You're so inquisitive.

213
00:22:41,603 --> 00:22:43,969
Well, you're so mysterious about them.

214
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,872
I hoped I was mysterious
about everything.

215
00:22:47,943 --> 00:22:49,934
Why don't you want me
to meet your family?

216
00:22:50,012 --> 00:22:51,343
Who are you ashamed of, them or me?

217
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,574
Don't be so vulgar, Charles.

218
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,889
I'm not having you mixed up
with my family. You're my friend.

219
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,728
I don't have a family.

220
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:10,664
You have me.

221
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:19,298
Sebastian and Charles,
contra mundum.

222
00:23:23,312 --> 00:23:24,904
Contra mundum.

223
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:45,695
Father?

224
00:23:48,504 --> 00:23:49,732
Father?

225
00:23:52,775 --> 00:23:56,040
- Back already?
- Term's over.

226
00:23:56,111 --> 00:23:57,510
So soon?

227
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:18,088
Thank you.

228
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:21,433
- Father, I have to leave at once!
- Oh, yes?

229
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:22,902
A great friend of mine
has had a terrible accident.

230
00:24:22,971 --> 00:24:25,098
- I must go to him.
- May I?

231
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:33,374
"Gravely injured.
Come at once. Sebastian."

232
00:24:35,484 --> 00:24:38,385
I'm sorry you're upset.

233
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:40,012
Reading this message,

234
00:24:40,088 --> 00:24:44,957
I would say that the accident was not
as serious as you seem to suggest

235
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:48,963
or it would not have been signed
by the victim himself.

236
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:56,403
Still, of course, he may well be
fully conscious, but horribly paralyzed.

237
00:24:56,505 --> 00:24:59,838
Remind me.
Why is your presence necessary?

238
00:24:59,908 --> 00:25:02,706
I told you, he's a great friend.

239
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:07,579
Well, I shall miss you, my boy,
but don't hurry back on my account.

240
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:27,998
Take your bag, sir?

241
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:35,708
Excuse me!

242
00:25:41,483 --> 00:25:43,383
Are you Charles Ryder?

243
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,320
Yes. Sorry. Hello.

244
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:50,847
I'm Julia, Sebastian's sister.
I've been sent to pick you up.

245
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:52,621
Hop in, Mr. Ryder.

246
00:25:56,698 --> 00:25:59,690
- Case in the back.
- Sorry, yes.

247
00:26:29,197 --> 00:26:30,425
How's Sebastian?

248
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:33,024
- He's fine.
- Fine?

249
00:26:33,101 --> 00:26:34,898
Did he tell you he was dying?

250
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,268
Well, I thought... His message said...

251
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:39,807
I expect he thought
you wouldn't come if you knew.

252
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:41,398
He's not badly hurt, then?

253
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:45,378
He cracked a bone in his foot
so small it hasn't even got a name.

254
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:48,007
- How did it happen?
- Playing croquet.

255
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,955
I must admit,
I did think it was a little queer,

256
00:26:55,023 --> 00:26:57,389
you traveling all this way
for a croquet injury.

257
00:26:57,459 --> 00:27:00,121
I don't mind.
It's wonderful to be here again.

258
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:02,186
Is it? Why?

259
00:27:02,264 --> 00:27:05,665
Well, it's such a beautiful house,
for one thing.

260
00:27:05,734 --> 00:27:07,725
I can't stand the place.

261
00:27:13,108 --> 00:27:15,338
Be an angel and light me one.

262
00:27:53,782 --> 00:27:55,773
There you are, at last!

263
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:00,878
- I thought you were dying.
- I thought I was, too.

264
00:28:00,956 --> 00:28:02,981
The pain was excruciating.

265
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:07,485
Julia, ask Wilcox
to fetch us some champagne.

266
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:10,053
- I hate champagne.
- For our guest.

267
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,696
Well, take your coat off. You'll boil.

268
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:22,172
Come along, Charles.

269
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,823
I thought you hated champagne.

270
00:28:38,894 --> 00:28:39,986
I do.

271
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:44,289
I suppose Sebastian's told you
all about us?

272
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,299
No. No, nothing at all,
as a matter of fact.

273
00:28:46,368 --> 00:28:48,029
And nor should I.

274
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:51,030
What?

275
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:54,303
- I take it you're not one of us?
- Don't answer.

276
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:56,037
I don't live like this,
if that's what you mean.

277
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:59,080
She means you're not a Catholic.

278
00:28:59,147 --> 00:29:01,377
Sorry, no. No, nothing at all.

279
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,011
- You mean you're an atheist?
- Well, yes, I suppose.

280
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:06,714
Strictly speaking, we're C of E,

281
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:11,054
but Father only ever goes
for Christmas and funerals.

282
00:29:12,027 --> 00:29:13,961
He likes those.

283
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:16,964
- What about your mother?
- She's dead.

284
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:20,294
I was very young.

285
00:29:20,368 --> 00:29:22,836
She died working for the Red Cross.

286
00:29:22,904 --> 00:29:24,462
Which, given her devotion to good,

287
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:27,633
does rather point up
the arbitrariness of it all.

288
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:31,270
I see. So, you're here arbitrarily?

289
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:33,871
He's here as my friend.

290
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:38,113
Given Mr. Ryder's
staunch position on religion,

291
00:29:38,186 --> 00:29:40,654
don't you think he ought to know
what he's getting into?

292
00:29:40,722 --> 00:29:42,519
Leave Charles out of it.

293
00:29:42,591 --> 00:29:44,786
- Tell me.
- Oh, God.

294
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,886
Mummy takes her faith
very seriously, indeed.

295
00:29:47,963 --> 00:29:51,490
So seriously, in fact,
that our fat little priest, Father Mackay,

296
00:29:51,566 --> 00:29:53,591
called her a living saint.

297
00:29:54,302 --> 00:29:56,600
Mind you, he drinks.

298
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:59,105
Sebastian and I
are a couple of heathens.

299
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:03,235
I'm not a heathen, I'm a sinner.
Cast out from God's love.

300
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:06,644
As for you,
you're not a heathen at all, not really.

301
00:30:07,783 --> 00:30:10,718
Why do we always end up
talking about family?

302
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:13,918
It's time for my bath.

303
00:30:15,957 --> 00:30:18,983
Good evening, Mr. Ryder.
Look after my brother.

304
00:30:29,271 --> 00:30:31,171
I don't think your sister
likes me very much.

305
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:33,935
I don't think
she cares for anyone much.

306
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:36,441
I love her.

307
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,237
She's like me.

308
00:30:40,415 --> 00:30:43,077
Drink in remembrance of me.

309
00:30:47,823 --> 00:30:48,812
Hang on.

310
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:21,954
In fact, I know that that's checkmate.

311
00:31:27,829 --> 00:31:29,194
Come here.

312
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,094
If only it could be
like this always.

313
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:37,928
Always summer.

314
00:31:39,407 --> 00:31:40,897
Always alone.

315
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,771
Fruit always ripe.

316
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:55,249
Cheers.

317
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:02,623
Now,

318
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,692
try this.

319
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:19,278
- No?
- It's a shy little wine. Like a gazelle.

320
00:32:23,885 --> 00:32:26,979
- Like a leprechaun.
- Dappled in a tapestry meadow.

321
00:32:28,857 --> 00:32:30,882
A flute by still water.

322
00:32:32,227 --> 00:32:36,994
This is a wise old wine.

323
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:45,737
A prophet in a cave.

324
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:47,206
And this

325
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,872
is a string of pearls on a white neck.

326
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:00,718
- A swan.
- The last unicorn.

327
00:33:53,608 --> 00:33:55,098
Who's that?

328
00:34:02,684 --> 00:34:05,585
- Is that your brother?
- Yes, that's Bridey.

329
00:34:06,554 --> 00:34:09,717
- He seems all right to me.
- Wait till you meet him.

330
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:16,825
Mother.

331
00:34:30,011 --> 00:34:31,308
Hello, there.

332
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,313
Go away,
we're not decent!

333
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:36,145
- Mummy's here.
- We know.

334
00:34:36,217 --> 00:34:38,617
She's invited Charles to dinner.

335
00:34:47,395 --> 00:34:49,659
It's not what we
agreed upon, Sebastian,

336
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:52,598
when we talked about this
at Christmas, when you came down.

337
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:55,568
It's no use crying, darling.
That's just childish.

338
00:34:57,405 --> 00:35:00,431
That's not going to help, is it?

339
00:35:00,508 --> 00:35:03,102
You see, darling,
whatever yesterday's sins,

340
00:35:03,178 --> 00:35:05,908
we must all pray for God's forgiveness.

341
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:12,647
So now, you try and try again now.

342
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,121
Be a good boy.
For God and for Mummy.

343
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:24,192
Now, just put your shirt on now.

344
00:35:24,265 --> 00:35:26,165
Dining room's this way.

345
00:35:30,071 --> 00:35:33,666
Is Sebastian all right?
He seemed upset.

346
00:35:34,075 --> 00:35:35,064
Oh.

347
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,370
He and Mummy often have these talks.

348
00:35:39,914 --> 00:35:43,111
Flannels for dinner?
Very bold, Mr. Ryder.

349
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:46,381
- Will your mother mind?
- Yes, she'll be appalled.

350
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:50,947
No, don't worry.
She'll be understanding.

351
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:54,188
- Do you often do that?
- What?

352
00:35:54,262 --> 00:35:58,665
- Say one thing, mean another?
- Yes and no.

353
00:36:18,286 --> 00:36:19,719
Thank you.

354
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,622
- Amen.
- Amen.

355
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:37,703
Welcome to Brideshead, Mr. Ryder.
I've been hearing all about you.

356
00:36:37,772 --> 00:36:42,004
I do hope you didn't let Sebastian
call you away in too much of a rush.

357
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:44,704
I'm afraid I didn't quite have time
to pack the right things.

358
00:36:44,779 --> 00:36:48,715
Sebastian must lend you some clothes
while you're here.

359
00:36:48,783 --> 00:36:50,944
Or perhaps Bridey's a better fit.

360
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:53,317
Are you a Bridey
or a Sebastian, Mr. Ryder?

361
00:36:53,388 --> 00:36:57,518
He can't borrow Bridey's clothes.
Bridey dresses like a bank clerk.

362
00:36:57,592 --> 00:37:01,323
Don't be vulgar, Cordelia.
Vulgar is not the same as funny.

363
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:06,390
I hope you've been
looked after properly, Ryder.

364
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:09,061
Has Sebastian
been seeing to the wine?

365
00:37:09,971 --> 00:37:13,134
Yes. Sebastian's been
seeing to the wine.

366
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,073
Delighted to hear it.

367
00:37:16,578 --> 00:37:19,672
- You're fond of wine?
- Yes, very.

368
00:37:19,747 --> 00:37:22,807
I wish I were.
It's such a bond with other men.

369
00:37:24,185 --> 00:37:27,814
At Christ Church, I tried to get drunk
more than once, but I didn't enjoy it.

370
00:37:27,889 --> 00:37:29,914
What do you enjoy, Bridey?

371
00:37:31,893 --> 00:37:34,953
Hunting, shooting,

372
00:37:37,365 --> 00:37:38,662
fishing.

373
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:44,970
And what form do your pleasures take,
Mr. Ryder?

374
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:47,303
- Sorry, pleasures?
- Your hobbies.

375
00:37:47,408 --> 00:37:49,399
- What do you do to relax?
- He drinks.

376
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:52,537
Drinking is not a hobby, Sebastian.

377
00:37:52,614 --> 00:37:55,412
- You live in London, is that correct?
- Yes.

378
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:57,917
- Whereabouts?
- Paddington.

379
00:37:59,787 --> 00:38:01,880
You live in a railway station?

380
00:38:01,956 --> 00:38:07,189
No, no. Sorry. No, I live nearby.

381
00:38:07,262 --> 00:38:08,524
I see.

382
00:38:08,596 --> 00:38:11,588
And has this led
to an interest in trains?

383
00:38:13,868 --> 00:38:15,358
No.

384
00:38:15,436 --> 00:38:19,497
So, are you close
with Sebastian's crowd?

385
00:38:21,909 --> 00:38:23,274
Not really.

386
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:28,077
- With Anthony Blanche?
- We're acquainted.

387
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,280
Charles is a painter, Mummy.

388
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:34,950
How charming.

389
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:36,547
We must get you
to paint something for us.

390
00:38:36,624 --> 00:38:39,889
- Would you do that, Mr. Ryder?
- I'd be delighted.

391
00:38:39,961 --> 00:38:43,761
I think Brideshead's the most
beautiful house I've ever seen.

392
00:38:46,901 --> 00:38:49,802
- It's utterly magical.
- How kind you are.

393
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,337
Summer at Brideshead.

394
00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:58,237
Mr. Ryder must stay with us
for the rest of the vacation.

395
00:38:58,313 --> 00:39:01,373
As a matter of fact,
I've just heard from Papa.

396
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:05,214
He wants me to go and see him
in Venice. And Julia.

397
00:39:05,286 --> 00:39:06,878
I see.

398
00:39:06,954 --> 00:39:09,149
And do you intend
to accept this invitation?

399
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:10,588
Yes. Why not?

400
00:39:10,658 --> 00:39:12,125
What about you, Julia?
Will you be going?

401
00:39:12,193 --> 00:39:13,490
I'd like to.

402
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:16,189
Wouldn't you rather
stay at Brideshead?

403
00:39:22,136 --> 00:39:25,162
Well, yes, if you want me to.

404
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:32,139
- You must not neglect your duty.
- No, Mother.

405
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,179
I think we might spend a little time
in the chapel after dinner.

406
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:48,926
- Would you join us, Mr. Ryder?
- Thank you.

407
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:51,487
You do know Charles is an atheist?

408
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:55,032
An agnostic, surely.

409
00:39:57,071 --> 00:39:58,595
Actually, no.

410
00:39:59,907 --> 00:40:04,173
But you'll join us, anyway,
out of curiosity.

411
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:07,812
Thank you.

412
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:15,551
- No Sebastian?
- No, Mummy.

413
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,782
Charles, are you really an atheist?

414
00:40:21,195 --> 00:40:25,097
- Yes, I am.
- How awful for you.

415
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,259
I'll put you on my prayer list.

416
00:40:27,335 --> 00:40:31,738
I have a long list of people I pray for,
including six black Cordelias in Africa.

417
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:33,967
It's a new thing. You send five bob
to some nuns in Africa,

418
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:37,010
and they christen a baby after you.

419
00:40:37,078 --> 00:40:38,067
Right.

420
00:40:38,913 --> 00:40:42,849
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

421
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:45,818
Give us this day our daily bread,

422
00:40:45,887 --> 00:40:47,946
and forgive us our trespasses

423
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:51,423
as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

424
00:40:51,526 --> 00:40:56,759
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

425
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:57,957
Amen.

426
00:41:39,674 --> 00:41:42,234
Have you ever
been to Venice, Mr. Ryder?

427
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:44,301
No. No, I haven't.

428
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:47,905
Every ambitious young man
should visit Venice.

429
00:41:47,982 --> 00:41:50,576
It makes one sound more complete.

430
00:41:52,687 --> 00:41:57,647
I was thinking, if Sebastian were to go,

431
00:41:57,725 --> 00:42:01,183
it might be a good thing
if you were to accompany him.

432
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:05,058
He needs someone plausible
by his side.

433
00:42:06,133 --> 00:42:11,696
I gather last time he was there, he was
befriending some very odd types.

434
00:42:11,772 --> 00:42:14,502
It's youthful high spirits, I understand,

435
00:42:15,376 --> 00:42:20,211
but in the end,
we must all accept God's limits.

436
00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:23,812
Atheist, or no.

437
00:42:29,423 --> 00:42:31,448
I know I can rely on you.

438
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,190
You seem to me
a very reliable young man.

439
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:15,435
- San Giovanni e Paolo.
- Oh, dear.

440
00:43:15,503 --> 00:43:18,631
I can see
you're going to be impossibly curious.

441
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:22,835
By the way, I should warn you.
Our lovely father is rather a scoundrel.

442
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:25,606
He lives
in one of the palazzos with Cara.

443
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,739
- Who's Cara?
- His mistress.

444
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:31,713
Poor Papa's rather shunned by society.

445
00:43:31,786 --> 00:43:34,277
Not the Italians, of course.
They adore him.

446
00:43:38,759 --> 00:43:42,695
- Santa Maria dei Miracoli.
- I know. I've seen the postcard.

447
00:44:10,825 --> 00:44:13,521
- My dear boy!
- Darling, Papa.

448
00:44:15,563 --> 00:44:17,531
- You look so young!
- Do you think so?

449
00:44:17,598 --> 00:44:20,658
I've taken to playing tennis
at the Lido with a professional.

450
00:44:20,735 --> 00:44:22,862
Cara thinks I'm getting far too fat.

451
00:44:22,937 --> 00:44:24,165
Julia, come here.

452
00:44:24,238 --> 00:44:26,968
- Father.
- My child.

453
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:29,305
- I wasn't sure if you'd come.
- Mummy gave me her blessing.

454
00:44:29,377 --> 00:44:31,937
Blessed by your mother.
What a saint that woman is.

455
00:44:32,013 --> 00:44:34,641
You know, I used to try everything
to please her.

456
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:36,478
Julia, this is your friend, Mr. Ryder?

457
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:39,348
- Charles is my friend, Papa.
- I see.

458
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,116
- Delighted.
- How do you do, sir?

459
00:44:42,189 --> 00:44:45,989
- Welcome to Venice.
- Here's Cara. Now we can eat.

460
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,028
Come along now. This way.

461
00:45:01,709 --> 00:45:04,576
Don't look so greedy. It won't go away.

462
00:45:05,713 --> 00:45:06,941
Sorry.

463
00:45:11,886 --> 00:45:14,411
I wasn't sure you'd come to Venice.

464
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:17,521
Your father seemed
pleased to see you.

465
00:45:17,591 --> 00:45:20,389
I'm not sure Father
cares much if I come.

466
00:45:20,461 --> 00:45:23,453
He'd probably be just as happy
if it was only Sebastian.

467
00:45:23,531 --> 00:45:27,331
They adore each other.
They're alike in so many ways.

468
00:45:29,336 --> 00:45:31,201
- Who are you like?
- Me?

469
00:45:31,806 --> 00:45:32,795
Oh.

470
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:35,036
Nobody.

471
00:45:35,976 --> 00:45:37,876
I'm the family shadow.

472
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:45,213
Drinks.

473
00:45:48,656 --> 00:45:51,489
- Julia.
- Cara.

474
00:45:53,828 --> 00:45:57,628
Mr. Ryder, Sebastian tells me
you are a painter.

475
00:45:57,698 --> 00:46:00,258
- Charles is an artist.
- Good.

476
00:46:00,334 --> 00:46:04,600
Well, then I will show you all the
great art of Canaletto and Veronese.

477
00:46:05,573 --> 00:46:08,337
He never goes anywhere.
Such a philistine.

478
00:46:08,409 --> 00:46:12,106
I don't mind the art.
It's religion I can't stand.

479
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:15,239
The Italians seem unable
to paint anything half decent

480
00:46:15,316 --> 00:46:18,114
without putting Christ dying in it.

481
00:46:18,185 --> 00:46:19,914
Of course, your mother loved Italy.

482
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,853
- A pietà on every street corner.
- Don't be cruel.

483
00:46:22,923 --> 00:46:26,757
On the contrary, she'd be flattered.
God was always her first love.

484
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:29,227
- Mummy loves all of us equally.
- Come now, Julia.

485
00:46:29,296 --> 00:46:31,764
You were the one who walked away!

486
00:46:37,872 --> 00:46:41,137
What must you think of us, Mr. Ryder?

487
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:44,371
- A family of monsters, are we not?
- No, not at all.

488
00:46:45,913 --> 00:46:48,347
I lost my mother when I was young.

489
00:46:53,621 --> 00:46:59,150
Tell me, Mr. Ryder, as an artist,
what did you make of Brideshead?

490
00:47:00,327 --> 00:47:02,090
I thought it was magnificent.

491
00:47:02,163 --> 00:47:05,428
You think that? Really?

492
00:47:05,499 --> 00:47:07,831
And now, here you are in Venice.

493
00:47:08,736 --> 00:47:10,795
What a lot of temptations.

494
00:47:27,488 --> 00:47:31,891
He walks for two hours
every day. He wants to be immortal.

495
00:47:31,959 --> 00:47:35,417
But he's quite fragile, you know, inside.

496
00:47:37,531 --> 00:47:39,931
That woman nearly suffocated him.

497
00:47:41,535 --> 00:47:46,973
- She's been very kind to me.
- Oh, yes. I'm sure. But you will see.

498
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:50,209
Well, just look at her children.

499
00:47:50,277 --> 00:47:52,939
Even when they were tiny,
in the nursery,

500
00:47:53,013 --> 00:47:54,810
they must do
what she want them to do,

501
00:47:54,882 --> 00:47:56,873
be what she want them to be.

502
00:47:56,951 --> 00:47:59,215
Only then, would she love them.

503
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:06,225
It's not Lady Marchmain's fault.
Her God has done that to her.

504
00:48:06,293 --> 00:48:08,921
But surely you're Catholic, too?

505
00:48:08,996 --> 00:48:11,897
Yes, but a different sort.

506
00:48:11,966 --> 00:48:16,460
It's different in Italy. Not so much guilt.

507
00:48:16,537 --> 00:48:21,201
We do what the heart tell us,
and then we go to confession.

508
00:48:29,683 --> 00:48:32,379
Sebastian loves you very much, I think.

509
00:48:34,288 --> 00:48:35,277
There you are.

510
00:48:35,356 --> 00:48:39,850
They're very good,
these romantic English friendships,

511
00:48:39,927 --> 00:48:42,691
if they don't go on too long.

512
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:48,992
For you, it's just a,
how do you say, "a phase"?

513
00:48:51,171 --> 00:48:54,436
But I think it's more than that
for poor Sebastian.

514
00:49:00,481 --> 00:49:02,608
Tread carefully, Mr. Ryder.

515
00:49:06,854 --> 00:49:08,116
Come on.

516
00:49:09,556 --> 00:49:12,150
- Hello.
- No! No!

517
00:49:18,098 --> 00:49:19,360
Come on.

518
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:22,063
Got you.

519
00:50:14,955 --> 00:50:17,719
- Can't sleep.
- Try pajamas.

520
00:50:24,498 --> 00:50:27,934
I enjoyed the beach today.
I hope I wasn't too rough.

521
00:50:28,035 --> 00:50:29,832
You were very sweet.

522
00:50:35,709 --> 00:50:37,006
Charles?

523
00:50:39,246 --> 00:50:40,907
There you are.

524
00:50:50,357 --> 00:50:51,619
Sorry.

525
00:50:53,961 --> 00:50:55,485
Lots to drink.

526
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,832
I'm so glad you're here.

527
00:51:01,902 --> 00:51:04,769
- I'm glad you're here.
- I'm glad I came.

528
00:51:04,838 --> 00:51:08,672
- Did I say I'm glad you're here?
- You're really glad I'm here?

529
00:51:21,455 --> 00:51:24,185
Let's get plastered.
- If you want.

530
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:27,954
Oh, yes, I do. I want. I want.

531
00:51:36,503 --> 00:51:38,630
There's a wonderful chapel
near here!

532
00:51:38,705 --> 00:51:41,799
You will see a masterpiece, I tell you.

533
00:52:01,361 --> 00:52:03,727
The devil's got his eye on you!

534
00:52:07,067 --> 00:52:09,433
Well, then you must protect me.

535
00:52:32,092 --> 00:52:33,252
Julia!

536
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:23,440
Julia.

537
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:26,604
I got lost. All those people.

538
00:53:59,313 --> 00:54:01,110
What are you doing?

539
00:54:03,417 --> 00:54:05,078
What's the matter?

540
00:54:07,921 --> 00:54:08,910
No!

541
00:55:24,564 --> 00:55:26,828
Funny old religion, isn't it?

542
00:55:30,771 --> 00:55:32,170
Sebastian,

543
00:55:35,542 --> 00:55:39,205
what happened just now...
I never meant you to...

544
00:55:42,983 --> 00:55:45,474
If I'd known it was going to happen,

545
00:55:48,088 --> 00:55:49,749
I'd never have...

546
00:55:52,826 --> 00:55:55,420
I don't know what I'm supposed to...

547
00:56:55,355 --> 00:56:57,721
Checkmate.

548
00:57:00,961 --> 00:57:05,830
I'm boring you.
Perhaps it is dull for you here.

549
00:57:07,234 --> 00:57:09,361
You've been enjoying yourself?

550
00:57:09,436 --> 00:57:12,735
- I've been in Venice.
- Oh, yes, yes, I suppose so.

551
00:57:14,508 --> 00:57:18,968
The friend you were
so much concerned about, did he die?

552
00:57:22,182 --> 00:57:24,878
- No.
- I'm very thankful.

553
00:57:24,951 --> 00:57:28,944
You should have written to tell me.
I worried about him so much.

554
00:57:44,538 --> 00:57:46,768
Watch out, Flyte!
- Sebastian!

555
00:57:49,776 --> 00:57:52,210
- Sebastian!
- Leave me alone!

556
00:57:55,982 --> 00:57:59,281
- Damn. Where is he? The bastard.
- Who?

557
00:57:59,386 --> 00:58:01,547
- Mr. Samgrass.
- Who's Mr. Samgrass?

558
00:58:01,621 --> 00:58:04,784
One of Mummy's gang.
Fat little Catholic from All Souls.

559
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:06,485
Bastard's been set up to follow me.

560
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,824
I wouldn't mind
if he wasn't so infernally ugly.

561
00:58:08,895 --> 00:58:12,353
God, I feel a hundred years old.

562
00:58:12,432 --> 00:58:15,026
Why haven't you called round?
I've been worried.

563
00:58:15,101 --> 00:58:18,537
I was beginning to think
they hadn't sent you up.

564
00:58:18,605 --> 00:58:21,073
- Since Venice.
- Yes.

565
00:58:25,879 --> 00:58:28,109
- Damn! There he is again.
- Who? What are you talking about?

566
00:58:28,181 --> 00:58:30,615
- Mr. Samgrass! There!
- Do you mind?

567
00:58:30,684 --> 00:58:33,016
Mummy's hired him to watch me.

568
00:58:33,086 --> 00:58:35,452
- What does he want?
- My head on a plate.

569
00:58:35,522 --> 00:58:39,720
Look, if he's bothering you,
I can stop him.

570
00:58:42,128 --> 00:58:45,791
Dear Charles, always so certain.

571
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:50,425
- I'm not certain of anything.
- Aren't you?

572
00:58:55,342 --> 00:58:58,368
By the way, Mummy's here.

573
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,048
She has to talk to you.

574
00:59:03,683 --> 00:59:05,947
Probably wants you
to spy on me as well.

575
00:59:06,019 --> 00:59:07,782
Don't be like that.

576
00:59:09,356 --> 00:59:12,757
Why don't I come round
to your rooms later?

577
00:59:12,826 --> 00:59:15,556
I'm not sure I want to see you anymore.

578
00:59:29,242 --> 00:59:30,709
I'm so sorry.

579
00:59:49,896 --> 00:59:51,761
So, Charles,

580
00:59:54,701 --> 00:59:57,226
- how was Venice?
- Venice was fine.

581
00:59:58,672 --> 01:00:02,472
- A strange way to put it.
- It was beautiful.

582
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:04,874
Speaking as an artist or a man?

583
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:10,349
I want a word with you
about Sebastian.

584
01:00:10,417 --> 01:00:12,385
I'm concerned about him.

585
01:00:14,187 --> 01:00:15,654
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

586
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:18,590
- Why? Should I be?
- He's drinking too much.

587
01:00:18,658 --> 01:00:22,560
You must have noticed.
After all, I sent you to look after him.

588
01:00:23,597 --> 01:00:25,394
Yes, I suppose
we both drink too much, really.

589
01:00:25,465 --> 01:00:27,194
No, not at all. You drink to get drunk,

590
01:00:27,267 --> 01:00:30,828
Sebastian drinks to escape
the claims of his conscience.

591
01:00:34,608 --> 01:00:37,338
I do wish I could understand
why he's so particularly upset.

592
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:41,107
Ever since he came back from Venice,
he's been unreachable.

593
01:00:41,915 --> 01:00:45,442
- Did something happen there?
- No.

594
01:00:47,954 --> 01:00:50,889
- You all had a good time?
- Yes.

595
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:54,525
I wonder what it could have been.

596
01:00:57,364 --> 01:01:00,094
I hope you didn't let Julia mislead you.

597
01:01:01,267 --> 01:01:04,065
- I don't understand.
- I think you do.

598
01:01:05,605 --> 01:01:06,629
Please understand,

599
01:01:06,706 --> 01:01:10,574
I would not want you
to make yourself look foolish, Charles.

600
01:01:11,444 --> 01:01:16,313
Her future is not a question of choice.
It is a matter of faith.

601
01:01:17,884 --> 01:01:21,342
Were it simply
a difference in upbringing,

602
01:01:21,421 --> 01:01:23,150
this I might overlook.

603
01:01:23,223 --> 01:01:25,555
But you are a self-proclaimed atheist,

604
01:01:25,625 --> 01:01:29,391
and my daughter
is destined to marry a Catholic.

605
01:01:29,462 --> 01:01:31,589
God commands and we obey.

606
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,328
However, we're forgetting ourselves.

607
01:01:35,402 --> 01:01:38,064
We're here to talk
about your friendship with my son.

608
01:01:38,138 --> 01:01:41,232
I'm not sure Sebastian
wants to be my friend anymore.

609
01:01:41,307 --> 01:01:42,934
Because of Julia?

610
01:01:43,977 --> 01:01:46,502
But that is all cleared up now.

611
01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:48,308
We're giving a ball for Julia's 21 st.

612
01:01:48,381 --> 01:01:51,009
I'd like you
to keep Sebastian company.

613
01:01:52,118 --> 01:01:54,177
You came to Brideshead
as my son's friend.

614
01:01:54,254 --> 01:01:57,519
If you have
unaccountably offended him,

615
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:01,424
it is surely not too much to ask
that you revisit your responsibilities.

616
01:02:03,196 --> 01:02:06,723
- To him or to you?
- To the family.

617
01:02:09,736 --> 01:02:11,636
And, of course,

618
01:02:11,705 --> 01:02:15,732
Brideshead does look particularly
beautiful at this time of year.

619
01:02:18,044 --> 01:02:20,103
Tell me, I'm curious.

620
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:24,614
Since, as you claim,
you have no religion,

621
01:02:26,286 --> 01:02:29,380
what do you imagine
you are doing on this earth?

622
01:02:31,357 --> 01:02:33,757
Living my life, the same as you.

623
01:02:33,827 --> 01:02:37,354
But without faith,
what could your purpose possibly be?

624
01:02:41,167 --> 01:02:43,795
I want to look back and say that I was

625
01:02:44,504 --> 01:02:45,493
alive.

626
01:02:47,474 --> 01:02:51,171
That I didn't turn my back. That I tried.

627
01:02:53,379 --> 01:02:55,142
That I was happy.

628
01:02:55,248 --> 01:02:58,149
Happiness in this life is irrelevant.

629
01:02:58,218 --> 01:03:00,379
All that matters,

630
01:03:00,453 --> 01:03:05,652
the only thing of consequence,
is the life hereafter.

631
01:03:16,736 --> 01:03:18,761
Ready for the off.

632
01:03:19,906 --> 01:03:22,534
A beautiful day for it, isn't it? Come on.

633
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:55,173
Funny, isn't it?
It's my little present to the family.

634
01:03:55,241 --> 01:03:58,404
- Rex Mottram. How do you do?
- Charles Ryder.

635
01:03:59,145 --> 01:04:02,205
Good to meet you, Charles.
Heard all about you.

636
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:06,046
We should compare notes some time.

637
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:08,314
- Going on the hunt?
- I don't think so.

638
01:04:08,388 --> 01:04:11,846
Wise man. Load of English
blue bloods on horseback.

639
01:04:12,759 --> 01:04:14,693
Got to fit in, though!

640
01:04:27,907 --> 01:04:29,306
Who is it?

641
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,011
It's me.

642
01:04:36,015 --> 01:04:38,813
You could have knocked.
I nearly spilt my drink.

643
01:04:38,885 --> 01:04:40,079
I did.

644
01:04:43,523 --> 01:04:44,854
Sit down.

645
01:05:15,889 --> 01:05:18,483
If only it could be like this always.

646
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:21,954
- Always summer.
- Ancient history.

647
01:05:23,596 --> 01:05:25,325
Pass me a towel.

648
01:05:41,314 --> 01:05:43,646
Where's that damn shirt?

649
01:05:45,551 --> 01:05:48,714
You're shaking. What is it?
What's the matter?

650
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:52,658
Don't you know, Charles?

651
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,690
"Why this is hell, nor am I out of it."

652
01:05:57,263 --> 01:06:00,391
- Sebastian, if I've ever done anything...
- It's not you.

653
01:06:01,567 --> 01:06:02,932
It's me.

654
01:06:07,573 --> 01:06:12,476
For God's sake, do stop mooning at me
like a great big cow!

655
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,811
I'm fine.

656
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:20,844
I'm fine so long
as I've got plenty of this.

657
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,253
I want you to know that
whatever happened in Venice,

658
01:06:24,757 --> 01:06:28,386
I'm not in your mother's gang,
if that's what you think.

659
01:06:30,096 --> 01:06:31,893
I'm on your side.

660
01:06:33,366 --> 01:06:34,355
Contra mundum.

661
01:06:38,905 --> 01:06:40,634
Dear Charles,

662
01:06:44,911 --> 01:06:47,277
you're not in anybody's gang.

663
01:06:48,414 --> 01:06:50,905
That's always been your problem.

664
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,594
Why are you going on the hunt?
I thought you detested hunting.

665
01:07:05,465 --> 01:07:06,659
I do.

666
01:07:08,868 --> 01:07:12,133
I'm going to leave Bridey
at the first covert,

667
01:07:12,205 --> 01:07:16,039
hack over to the nearest pub,
and spend the whole day drinking.

668
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:19,908
If they treat me like a dipsomaniac,

669
01:07:19,979 --> 01:07:22,709
they can bloody well
have a dipsomaniac.

670
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:24,777
Well, they can't stop you.

671
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:27,081
They can, as a matter of fact,

672
01:07:30,256 --> 01:07:34,215
by not giving me any money.
They've stopped my bank account.

673
01:07:36,529 --> 01:07:39,293
I've pawned my watch
and cigarette case.

674
01:07:40,767 --> 01:07:42,826
That lasted for a bit,

675
01:07:44,637 --> 01:07:46,662
but that's all gone now.

676
01:07:48,141 --> 01:07:50,302
So, regretfully...

677
01:07:51,177 --> 01:07:53,441
Sebastian, I can't do that.

678
01:07:54,547 --> 01:07:57,607
- I thought you were on my side.
- I am.

679
01:07:57,683 --> 01:07:59,150
Well, then.

680
01:07:59,786 --> 01:08:02,152
Look, why don't I come with you?

681
01:08:02,989 --> 01:08:05,321
It's miserable drinking alone.

682
01:08:05,892 --> 01:08:07,757
We could get drunk together,
like we used to.

683
01:08:07,827 --> 01:08:08,816
No.

684
01:08:10,696 --> 01:08:12,493
I'm past all that.

685
01:08:13,733 --> 01:08:15,701
Thanks for the offer.

686
01:08:19,205 --> 01:08:20,365
Well?

687
01:08:21,974 --> 01:08:24,238
Are you with me or against me?

688
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:54,103
Little bit further up
on the shoulder, though.

689
01:08:54,173 --> 01:08:55,640
Sarah, look.

690
01:08:56,742 --> 01:08:58,437
Sort of up here.

691
01:09:52,498 --> 01:09:56,764
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure to announce,

692
01:09:56,836 --> 01:09:59,771
on top of the birthday festivities,

693
01:09:59,839 --> 01:10:03,969
the engagement of my eldest daughter,
the Lady Julia Flyte

694
01:10:04,043 --> 01:10:05,840
to Mr. Rex Mottram.

695
01:10:19,659 --> 01:10:21,991
Yes, it's marvelous, isn't it.

696
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:31,603
- Thank you, Charles. I'd love to dance.
- Cordelia.

697
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:34,265
- Cordelia, I'm...
- Come along!

698
01:10:44,517 --> 01:10:46,075
- Charles?
- Hmm?

699
01:10:46,886 --> 01:10:50,947
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but modern art,

700
01:10:51,591 --> 01:10:55,083
- it is all bosh, isn't it?
- Yes, it's all bosh.

701
01:10:55,161 --> 01:10:57,095
Good. I thought so.

702
01:11:00,433 --> 01:11:02,526
Get a grip, Charles!

703
01:11:03,769 --> 01:11:06,738
Rex! Rex, I need a better dancer.

704
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:10,368
Yours for five minutes and no more.

705
01:11:10,443 --> 01:11:12,468
- Come along.
- Okay.

706
01:11:14,747 --> 01:11:17,079
You're rather tall, aren't you?

707
01:11:17,149 --> 01:11:18,878
Is that a handicap?

708
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:41,229
Why didn't you tell me?

709
01:11:42,975 --> 01:11:45,637
It's not Sebastian. I don't believe that.

710
01:11:45,711 --> 01:11:47,702
Charles, I can't do this.

711
01:11:48,114 --> 01:11:50,582
- When we kissed...
- Please, stop!

712
01:11:52,485 --> 01:11:54,817
Why? It was wonderful.

713
01:11:56,555 --> 01:11:57,852
I know.

714
01:12:01,894 --> 01:12:04,192
I think about it all the time.

715
01:12:06,699 --> 01:12:08,496
I have no choice.

716
01:12:25,418 --> 01:12:28,387
- Oh, Sebastian.
- Never mind.

717
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:35,293
- Oh, Charles.
- Don't!

718
01:12:40,032 --> 01:12:42,000
- Come along, old boy.
- I don't want your help.

719
01:12:42,068 --> 01:12:44,195
You're in tweed, Sebastian.
This is a ball.

720
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:47,205
Bugger off, Bridey.
You're worse than wet.

721
01:12:50,743 --> 01:12:53,644
You see... What it is...

722
01:12:53,713 --> 01:12:56,011
I hate you all so very much!

723
01:12:56,782 --> 01:12:58,909
- Sebastian.
- Get off me!

724
01:12:59,385 --> 01:13:00,409
You don't care about me!

725
01:13:00,486 --> 01:13:02,283
All you ever wanted
was to sleep with my sister!

726
01:13:02,355 --> 01:13:04,653
Okay, Sebastian, that's enough.

727
01:13:05,624 --> 01:13:07,455
All right. I'm going.

728
01:13:50,136 --> 01:13:51,535
Charles,

729
01:13:54,507 --> 01:13:56,998
did you give Sebastian money today?

730
01:13:59,245 --> 01:14:00,712
Yes, I did.

731
01:14:02,948 --> 01:14:05,644
Knowing how he was likely to spend it?

732
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,714
Yes.

733
01:14:10,389 --> 01:14:12,152
I don't understand.

734
01:14:12,858 --> 01:14:15,793
How could you be so nice
in so many ways,

735
01:14:17,029 --> 01:14:19,793
and then do something
so wantonly cruel?

736
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:24,693
We all liked you so much.
I don't understand how we deserved it.

737
01:14:27,306 --> 01:14:32,175
Do you think it's better
to make him feel like a criminal?

738
01:14:33,913 --> 01:14:36,313
Having him watched
every second of the day?

739
01:14:36,382 --> 01:14:39,249
But you deliberately
helped him to drink.

740
01:14:41,854 --> 01:14:44,220
You're the reason he drinks,

741
01:14:45,691 --> 01:14:46,988
not me.

742
01:14:48,294 --> 01:14:49,921
All I did was

743
01:14:51,497 --> 01:14:53,260
try to give him a little freedom.

744
01:14:53,332 --> 01:14:57,496
No, you just wanted him to like you.
You're so desperate to be liked.

745
01:14:57,570 --> 01:15:00,198
I think you should leave now, Charles.

746
01:16:23,355 --> 01:16:26,290
Hello, there.
Would you like me to hold the ladder?

747
01:16:26,358 --> 01:16:27,848
Yes, thanks.

748
01:16:32,498 --> 01:16:35,296
I'm Celia Mulcaster, by the way.

749
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:39,428
Charles Ryder.

750
01:16:40,673 --> 01:16:45,167
I saw your paintings in the brochure
and thought how charming they looked.

751
01:16:48,113 --> 01:16:50,172
No need to look so gloomy.

752
01:16:50,916 --> 01:16:53,908
If I had half your talent, I'd be delirious.

753
01:16:56,088 --> 01:16:58,420
You can thank me, if you want.

754
01:17:00,426 --> 01:17:01,791
Thank you.

755
01:17:04,697 --> 01:17:07,359
Would you like me
to buy something now?

756
01:17:25,985 --> 01:17:29,318
Silent and grave,
and then "pop," mouse is dead.

757
01:17:31,056 --> 01:17:33,286
- Charles.
- Lady Marchmain.

758
01:17:35,494 --> 01:17:37,155
Thank you, Father.

759
01:17:39,231 --> 01:17:42,325
I'm so glad your son
didn't die of his injuries.

760
01:17:55,347 --> 01:17:58,077
Please, sit down.

761
01:17:58,651 --> 01:18:00,448
I'm fine, thank you.

762
01:18:03,055 --> 01:18:04,647
How did you know where I lived?

763
01:18:04,723 --> 01:18:06,623
My driver found you.

764
01:18:06,692 --> 01:18:09,354
The Ryders of Paddington
are limited in number.

765
01:18:09,428 --> 01:18:12,295
I hear you have your first exhibition
at the Royal Academy.

766
01:18:12,364 --> 01:18:13,991
Congratulations.

767
01:18:14,466 --> 01:18:16,627
I'm sure you're not here
to ask me how I am.

768
01:18:16,702 --> 01:18:21,071
No. The last time we saw each other,
it's true I spoke rather harshly.

769
01:18:21,807 --> 01:18:25,004
I'm not here to apologize.
What I said, I meant.

770
01:18:25,811 --> 01:18:29,008
I took you into my confidence,
and you betrayed me.

771
01:18:29,815 --> 01:18:32,579
I do hope you're not asking me
to agree with you.

772
01:18:32,651 --> 01:18:35,313
- I act only as God directs.
- Rubbish.

773
01:18:35,854 --> 01:18:39,119
God's your best invention.
Whatever you want, he does.

774
01:18:39,191 --> 01:18:43,787
- I am not here to argue with you.
- Good. I'm glad to hear it.

775
01:18:43,862 --> 01:18:46,854
The reason I called
was to ask you a favor.

776
01:18:50,169 --> 01:18:51,500
A favor?

777
01:18:53,305 --> 01:18:57,139
Sebastian's gone missing.
He's in a house in Morocco.

778
01:18:57,209 --> 01:19:00,610
I'm worried about him.
I need you to bring him back.

779
01:19:02,114 --> 01:19:04,309
You banish me from your house,

780
01:19:04,383 --> 01:19:07,716
you poison my friendship
with both your children

781
01:19:07,786 --> 01:19:10,721
and now you expect me
to go begging on your behalf?

782
01:19:10,789 --> 01:19:13,019
There's no one else I can ask.

783
01:19:13,358 --> 01:19:14,518
Even if I were to agree,

784
01:19:14,593 --> 01:19:17,824
what makes you think Sebastian
would take any notice of me?

785
01:19:17,896 --> 01:19:23,232
Because he cared for you more
than he ever cared for anyone else.

786
01:19:28,741 --> 01:19:31,539
All I ever wanted was to see them safe.

787
01:19:32,511 --> 01:19:34,706
And all they do is hate me.

788
01:19:51,363 --> 01:19:53,297
I'll be at Brideshead.

789
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,864
You may send word to me there.

790
01:19:57,402 --> 01:19:58,699
Driver!

791
01:20:01,874 --> 01:20:03,136
Driver!

792
01:21:56,521 --> 01:21:58,853
I'm looking for Sebastian Flyte.

793
01:22:03,362 --> 01:22:05,523
This is his house.

794
01:22:06,465 --> 01:22:09,093
- Who are you?
- I'm his friend.

795
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:13,204
In the local hospital.

796
01:22:15,007 --> 01:22:16,804
When you see him,

797
01:22:17,809 --> 01:22:20,004
tell him I'm still here.

798
01:22:26,351 --> 01:22:28,751
Your friend
has got the grippe.

799
01:22:30,822 --> 01:22:33,256
One of his lungs is full of fluid.

800
01:22:33,692 --> 01:22:37,321
He will recover. But travel with you?
Not a chance.

801
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:40,464
He's very weak. No resistance.

802
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:44,500
What do you expect?
He is an alcoholic.

803
01:23:15,434 --> 01:23:17,197
Here is your friend.

804
01:23:33,919 --> 01:23:36,387
What the hell are you doing here?

805
01:23:36,822 --> 01:23:38,790
Your mother asked me to come.

806
01:23:38,857 --> 01:23:41,485
She wants me to bring you back home,

807
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:46,196
but the doctor said
it's out of the question for you to travel.

808
01:23:46,498 --> 01:23:48,625
I wouldn't, even if I could.

809
01:23:49,401 --> 01:23:50,834
I think...

810
01:23:53,305 --> 01:23:55,205
I think she's dying.

811
01:24:03,915 --> 01:24:06,941
Walk with me. I'm meant to exercise.

812
01:24:26,671 --> 01:24:28,662
Did you go to my house?

813
01:24:29,975 --> 01:24:31,772
Did you meet Kurt?

814
01:24:32,911 --> 01:24:34,173
Yes.

815
01:24:36,181 --> 01:24:39,116
He wanted you to know
he was waiting for you.

816
01:24:40,185 --> 01:24:42,551
It's rather a pleasant change,

817
01:24:43,622 --> 01:24:47,217
when all your life
you've had people looking after you,

818
01:24:47,759 --> 01:24:50,455
to have someone to look after, yourself.

819
01:25:04,976 --> 01:25:07,035
I thought you'd want to go back
to Brideshead one day.

820
01:25:07,112 --> 01:25:08,579
Brideshead?

821
01:25:09,181 --> 01:25:10,648
Are you mad?

822
01:25:12,551 --> 01:25:15,145
The place would still be full of her.

823
01:25:17,255 --> 01:25:20,486
I wouldn't go within
a hundred miles of the place.

824
01:25:24,996 --> 01:25:26,520
I need to sit.

825
01:25:41,046 --> 01:25:42,445
I'm sorry.

826
01:25:43,281 --> 01:25:44,805
Whatever for?

827
01:25:54,893 --> 01:25:56,360
Everything.

828
01:25:57,395 --> 01:25:58,919
It's all right.

829
01:26:00,599 --> 01:26:01,861
Truly.

830
01:26:04,669 --> 01:26:06,694
I asked too much of you.

831
01:26:09,341 --> 01:26:11,468
I knew it all along, really.

832
01:26:13,578 --> 01:26:16,342
Only God can give you that sort of love.

833
01:26:23,989 --> 01:26:25,980
Come home, Sebastian.

834
01:26:28,293 --> 01:26:30,261
When you're well enough.

835
01:26:31,796 --> 01:26:33,923
Don't finish it like this.

836
01:26:37,302 --> 01:26:39,065
This is my life now.

837
01:26:41,473 --> 01:26:43,065
I'm happy here.

838
01:26:48,013 --> 01:26:49,537
I miss you.

839
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:54,278
How sweet of you to say that.

840
01:26:57,022 --> 01:26:58,546
Dear Charles,

841
01:27:02,093 --> 01:27:05,187
it was my fault for
bringing you to Brideshead.

842
01:27:10,735 --> 01:27:12,100
Run away.

843
01:27:14,272 --> 01:27:16,968
Run far away and don't ever look back.

844
01:28:10,962 --> 01:28:12,361
I'm sorry.

845
01:28:40,058 --> 01:28:42,253
You must be so proud of him.

846
01:28:42,827 --> 01:28:45,091
- Was he away long?
- Two years,

847
01:28:45,196 --> 01:28:46,925
and it doesn't feel like a day.

848
01:29:36,848 --> 01:29:38,406
Hello, Charles.

849
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:48,188
Did you know I was on the boat?

850
01:29:50,128 --> 01:29:52,824
If I said no, you wouldn't believe me.

851
01:29:58,603 --> 01:30:00,366
You're married now.

852
01:30:01,473 --> 01:30:02,565
Yes.

853
01:30:07,779 --> 01:30:11,715
- You haven't changed at all.
- Neither have you.

854
01:30:16,688 --> 01:30:19,020
- How ridiculous.
- Yes, isn't it?

855
01:30:22,861 --> 01:30:24,761
Tell me this is fate.

856
01:31:49,614 --> 01:31:51,343
- What?
- Nothing.

857
01:31:52,817 --> 01:31:54,148
Tell me.

858
01:31:54,953 --> 01:31:57,387
I was thinking about Sebastian.

859
01:31:58,189 --> 01:32:01,215
Mummy died without
ever seeing him again.

860
01:32:05,163 --> 01:32:06,425
I know.

861
01:32:11,035 --> 01:32:12,935
Let's go up on deck.

862
01:32:13,805 --> 01:32:16,831
- Are you sure?
- They're all asleep! Come on!

863
01:32:20,378 --> 01:32:21,743
Come on!

864
01:32:32,824 --> 01:32:34,018
Sorry.

865
01:32:38,563 --> 01:32:41,031
- So where's Rex?
- I drowned him.

866
01:32:41,766 --> 01:32:43,427
Forgive me, Rex!

867
01:32:57,649 --> 01:32:59,674
Lady Julia, fancy meeting you here.

868
01:32:59,751 --> 01:33:02,413
- Mr. Ryder.
- Could I possibly get you a drink?

869
01:33:02,487 --> 01:33:03,715
Dry martini, please.

870
01:33:03,788 --> 01:33:06,086
One dry Martini,
one whiskey with water.

871
01:33:06,157 --> 01:33:07,818
Please, allow me.

872
01:33:17,869 --> 01:33:19,496
So, why did you marry Rex?

873
01:33:19,571 --> 01:33:22,540
I don't know. Because he wasn't you.

874
01:33:23,041 --> 01:33:26,101
- Because he was rich.
- Because he was Catholic.

875
01:33:26,477 --> 01:33:29,310
Because Mummy approved,
God rest her soul.

876
01:33:31,382 --> 01:33:34,283
I thought he was my painted savage.

877
01:33:35,453 --> 01:33:38,286
It turns out he was
thoroughly up to date.

878
01:33:40,558 --> 01:33:41,650
Thank you.

879
01:33:41,726 --> 01:33:44,718
Now, no more talk about Rex.
He's in England.

880
01:33:53,671 --> 01:33:56,606
- Do you have children?
- No.

881
01:33:58,109 --> 01:33:59,269
No.

882
01:34:02,747 --> 01:34:05,944
- What will you tell your wife?
- Wait until London.

883
01:34:07,619 --> 01:34:11,419
I have a viewing to arrange.
I'll sort it out. It'll be fine.

884
01:34:12,223 --> 01:34:15,215
- Where shall we go?
- Somewhere abroad, like Daddy.

885
01:34:15,293 --> 01:34:18,160
- What about Italy? Capri?
- Antibes.

886
01:34:18,229 --> 01:34:19,218
- Seville.
- Verona.

887
01:34:19,297 --> 01:34:21,026
- Paris.
- Brideshead.

888
01:34:21,099 --> 01:34:22,999
- No!
- Why not?

889
01:34:24,268 --> 01:34:27,328
- It's the loveliest place on earth.
- I can't go back there.

890
01:34:27,405 --> 01:34:29,202
- Not after this.
- Nonsense.

891
01:34:29,273 --> 01:34:31,969
- We've nothing to apologize for.
- No.

892
01:34:34,112 --> 01:34:35,670
Besides, Rex is there.

893
01:34:35,747 --> 01:34:38,773
Leave it to me.
I'll settle things with Rex.

894
01:34:39,817 --> 01:34:41,785
I'll settle everything.

895
01:34:45,289 --> 01:34:46,586
Trust me.

896
01:34:47,825 --> 01:34:49,019
I do.

897
01:34:49,994 --> 01:34:52,326
- And stop worrying!
- I will.

898
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:10,671
Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Lovely day.

899
01:35:13,685 --> 01:35:15,414
Mr. and Mrs. Ryder.

900
01:35:16,721 --> 01:35:20,452
Look, that's the Duke
and Duchess of Clarence.

901
01:35:20,992 --> 01:35:24,359
- They want to buy one!
- How very gracious of them.

902
01:35:26,531 --> 01:35:31,230
Make an effort, Charles.
I've got you the cream of Mayfair.

903
01:35:34,539 --> 01:35:36,234
Mrs. Ryder, good day.

904
01:35:36,307 --> 01:35:39,834
Charles, how charming you look.

905
01:35:42,947 --> 01:35:44,209
Anthony.

906
01:35:44,716 --> 01:35:47,879
I heard, quite by chance, at a luncheon,
that you were having an exhibition.

907
01:35:47,952 --> 01:35:51,945
So, of course, I dashed impetuously
to the shrine to pay homage.

908
01:35:52,356 --> 01:35:54,256
Where are the pictures?

909
01:35:55,893 --> 01:35:57,986
Let me explain them to you.

910
01:36:08,873 --> 01:36:10,397
This is simply charm.

911
01:36:10,475 --> 01:36:14,969
Simple, creamy, English charm,
playing tigers.

912
01:36:17,915 --> 01:36:19,906
But enough of art.

913
01:36:19,984 --> 01:36:24,148
They tell me you are happy in love
and that is everything, isn't it?

914
01:36:24,222 --> 01:36:26,247
Or nearly everything.

915
01:36:27,625 --> 01:36:29,752
Everyone's talking about it.

916
01:36:29,827 --> 01:36:33,319
So, it's Julia now.
And it used to be Sebastian.

917
01:36:34,565 --> 01:36:36,863
Do you think I should warn her?

918
01:36:37,168 --> 01:36:39,102
Warn her about what?

919
01:36:40,204 --> 01:36:44,607
How apropos that you'd have
chosen jungles for your canvas.

920
01:36:46,778 --> 01:36:49,576
I always thought you
were the lamb to be slaughtered,

921
01:36:49,647 --> 01:36:52,480
when all along it is they
who are hunted.

922
01:36:54,118 --> 01:36:58,521
There really is no end to your hunger,
is there, Charles?

923
01:37:17,041 --> 01:37:19,703
Why do I feel so nervous?
- Don't be.

924
01:37:25,716 --> 01:37:29,709
- Who are all these people?
- Politicians, money men.

925
01:37:30,454 --> 01:37:32,251
Rex thinks there's a war
coming with Hitler.

926
01:37:32,323 --> 01:37:34,086
He wants to do well out of it.

927
01:37:34,158 --> 01:37:36,888
- It's all he talks about.
- Hello, Julia.

928
01:37:36,961 --> 01:37:39,122
- Hello, Rex.
- Good evening, Rex.

929
01:37:39,197 --> 01:37:41,722
Mr. Ryder,
welcome back to Brideshead.

930
01:37:41,799 --> 01:37:44,359
I hear you're making
quite a name for yourself.

931
01:37:44,435 --> 01:37:47,836
- Could I have a word with you?
- Later, I have guests.

932
01:37:54,478 --> 01:37:55,843
It's cold.

933
01:38:02,587 --> 01:38:04,020
Not here!

934
01:38:07,291 --> 01:38:10,192
- Sorry.
- Let's go back to London.

935
01:38:10,261 --> 01:38:13,924
- Let me settle everything with Rex.
- And then we'll leave?

936
01:38:14,599 --> 01:38:17,397
- Yes? Charles?
- Yes.

937
01:38:19,103 --> 01:38:21,128
If that's what you want.

938
01:38:32,984 --> 01:38:34,679
Hello, Bridey.

939
01:38:34,752 --> 01:38:37,721
- Hello, Julia. Just up from London?
- Yes.

940
01:38:38,489 --> 01:38:40,753
Welcome back to Brideshead, Charles.

941
01:38:40,825 --> 01:38:43,623
- How's your family?
- Fine, thank you.

942
01:38:45,229 --> 01:38:48,756
- Rex still entertaining?
- He's got business.

943
01:38:52,503 --> 01:38:55,370
I'm sorry he's not here.
I have a little announcement to make.

944
01:38:55,439 --> 01:38:57,373
Well, come on. Out with it.

945
01:38:57,441 --> 01:39:00,968
- I'm engaged to be married.
- Congratulations, Bridey.

946
01:39:01,045 --> 01:39:03,605
Well, who is she?

947
01:39:03,681 --> 01:39:06,275
- No one you know.
- Is she pretty?

948
01:39:06,784 --> 01:39:09,878
I don't think you could
exactly call her pretty.

949
01:39:09,987 --> 01:39:13,047
"Comely" is the word
I think of in her connection.

950
01:39:13,124 --> 01:39:14,955
She is a big woman.

951
01:39:15,026 --> 01:39:16,789
- Fat?
- No, big.

952
01:39:17,495 --> 01:39:20,555
She's called Mrs. Muspratt.
Her Christian name is Beryl.

953
01:39:20,631 --> 01:39:22,758
But, Bridey, where did you find her?

954
01:39:22,833 --> 01:39:26,633
Her late husband, Admiral Muspratt,
collected matchboxes.

955
01:39:27,071 --> 01:39:30,472
You're not marrying her
for her matchboxes, are you, Bridey?

956
01:39:30,541 --> 01:39:31,769
No, no.

957
01:39:32,276 --> 01:39:34,176
Matchboxes were left
to Falmouth Town Library.

958
01:39:34,245 --> 01:39:37,942
I'm just holding them for collection.
Why are you laughing?

959
01:39:38,549 --> 01:39:41,313
- I hope you'll be very happy.
- Thank you.

960
01:39:41,919 --> 01:39:45,286
- I think I'm very fortunate.
- You sly, old thing.

961
01:39:45,356 --> 01:39:47,517
When are we going to meet her?
You must bring her here.

962
01:39:47,591 --> 01:39:49,320
- I couldn't do that.
- Why not?

963
01:39:49,393 --> 01:39:50,451
Well, you must understand,

964
01:39:50,528 --> 01:39:53,429
Beryl is a woman
of strict Catholic principle,

965
01:39:53,497 --> 01:39:56,762
fortified by the prejudices
of the middle classes.

966
01:39:56,834 --> 01:39:59,359
I couldn't possibly bring her here.

967
01:40:00,004 --> 01:40:01,301
I don't understand.

968
01:40:01,372 --> 01:40:02,771
It may be a matter of indifference
to you,

969
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:05,934
whether or not you choose
to live in sin with Charles,

970
01:40:06,010 --> 01:40:09,468
but on no account would Beryl
consent to be your guest.

971
01:40:10,014 --> 01:40:12,574
How dare you talk to her like that?

972
01:40:14,819 --> 01:40:17,379
Bloody offensive thing to say!

973
01:40:17,455 --> 01:40:18,979
Really, there was nothing
she could object to.

974
01:40:19,056 --> 01:40:22,150
I was merely stating
a fact well known to her.

975
01:40:43,114 --> 01:40:45,674
Take no notice of him, my darling.

976
01:40:48,552 --> 01:40:49,541
So,

977
01:40:51,222 --> 01:40:53,747
got you. Sorry about the delay.

978
01:40:54,792 --> 01:40:56,555
I'll be outside.

979
01:41:08,706 --> 01:41:12,699
The door? Door's made
from all the works of Dickens.

980
01:41:12,777 --> 01:41:15,837
I had it installed especially. Want one?

981
01:41:17,014 --> 01:41:18,572
No, thank you.

982
01:41:22,953 --> 01:41:25,148
I know what you're thinking.

983
01:41:29,427 --> 01:41:32,590
How vulgar can it get?
You wanna know the secret?

984
01:41:37,768 --> 01:41:39,599
I do it on purpose.

985
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:43,071
It amuses me to offend
their delicate sensibilities.

986
01:41:44,608 --> 01:41:47,076
So, you wanna take my wife off me?

987
01:41:47,144 --> 01:41:50,341
You know she can't marry
a divorcé, right?

988
01:41:50,848 --> 01:41:53,749
- Against the rules.
- Well, at least she'll be free of you.

989
01:41:53,818 --> 01:41:55,285
She'll never be free.

990
01:41:55,352 --> 01:41:57,013
Don't pretend
you've been faithful to her.

991
01:41:57,088 --> 01:41:58,851
Who said anything about faith?

992
01:41:58,923 --> 01:42:03,087
I bet you'd love to get your hands
on the house, though, wouldn't you?

993
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:06,755
All those pretty paintings.
All those pretty views.

994
01:42:06,831 --> 01:42:09,664
Let her go, Rex. You never loved her.

995
01:42:09,733 --> 01:42:11,928
The only thing you ever had
in common was religion.

996
01:42:12,002 --> 01:42:14,869
Wrong. When I decided to marry Julia,
I wasn't a Catholic.

997
01:42:14,939 --> 01:42:17,271
I converted before the wedding.

998
01:42:19,043 --> 01:42:21,307
Bet she didn't tell you that.

999
01:42:21,779 --> 01:42:24,577
- I guessed.
- Oh, yeah?

1000
01:42:25,850 --> 01:42:27,545
You're the type.

1001
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:34,348
You people,

1002
01:42:35,993 --> 01:42:37,790
you never learn.

1003
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:43,022
You could have had it all
if you'd been a little more flexible.

1004
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:44,465
I did what I had to do.

1005
01:42:44,535 --> 01:42:46,696
They want a Catholic,
I'll convert to Catholicism.

1006
01:42:46,770 --> 01:42:47,896
It's a great religion.

1007
01:42:47,972 --> 01:42:51,669
You sin all you want, then you confess.
Problem solved.

1008
01:42:51,742 --> 01:42:53,835
You gotta woo these people.

1009
01:42:54,678 --> 01:42:56,202
This family don't live in the real world.

1010
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:59,738
- They're mortgaged up to the hilt.
- Get to the point.

1011
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:10,089
You want my wife? Make me an offer.

1012
01:43:10,794 --> 01:43:14,696
- I'm not just giving her away.
- Don't do this. It's demeaning.

1013
01:43:16,534 --> 01:43:18,331
Try a little harder.

1014
01:43:20,471 --> 01:43:22,371
You're a rich man, Rex,
you've already got what you wanted.

1015
01:43:22,439 --> 01:43:25,374
You can never have enough
of what you want.

1016
01:43:30,047 --> 01:43:31,708
No, you're right.

1017
01:43:32,283 --> 01:43:35,081
You're taking her off my hands.
That's a favor.

1018
01:43:35,152 --> 01:43:37,677
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1019
01:43:38,822 --> 01:43:44,727
You give me a couple of your jungle
pics, and I'll give you an annulment.

1020
01:43:44,795 --> 01:43:47,229
I hear you're worth collecting.

1021
01:43:52,269 --> 01:43:55,727
Come on, Charlie boy, say yes.
You know you want to.

1022
01:43:58,309 --> 01:44:00,334
You don't have to speak.

1023
01:44:03,581 --> 01:44:04,946
Just nod.

1024
01:44:23,367 --> 01:44:24,857
I'll have my driver take me to London.

1025
01:44:24,935 --> 01:44:27,870
He can pick up the paintings
in the morning.

1026
01:44:36,714 --> 01:44:40,411
You know she's mad.
Can't even give you children.

1027
01:44:42,453 --> 01:44:44,353
Lost the only one we had.

1028
01:45:04,842 --> 01:45:06,036
Julia?

1029
01:45:26,130 --> 01:45:28,223
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

1030
01:45:30,334 --> 01:45:32,734
- It's just a shock.
- Shh.

1031
01:45:32,970 --> 01:45:34,835
Shh. Don't.

1032
01:45:37,474 --> 01:45:40,136
I've always known, ever since nursery.

1033
01:45:41,745 --> 01:45:45,374
I tried to be good, I really did.
I tried. I married Rex.

1034
01:45:46,483 --> 01:45:49,281
All through the backgammon
and cigars, I tried.

1035
01:45:49,353 --> 01:45:52,982
But it's not enough. It's never enough.

1036
01:45:55,059 --> 01:45:56,856
God had to punish me.

1037
01:45:58,028 --> 01:46:00,519
So he took my little stillborn...

1038
01:46:00,998 --> 01:46:03,228
My child. My girl.

1039
01:46:04,735 --> 01:46:07,795
With you, I thought I could
really and truly be free.

1040
01:46:07,871 --> 01:46:10,704
But coming back here, it's like a thread,

1041
01:46:10,774 --> 01:46:14,801
an invisible thread drawing you back,
inch by inch,

1042
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:18,614
until all of a sudden,
you're a child again.

1043
01:46:19,283 --> 01:46:20,841
And that voice inside your head,

1044
01:46:20,918 --> 01:46:24,046
the one that Mummy planted
all those years ago in the nursery,

1045
01:46:24,121 --> 01:46:27,113
every night in the nursery,
filling your head with it.

1046
01:46:27,191 --> 01:46:29,386
And the voice is telling you,
whispering,

1047
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:32,657
"Wicked little Julia,
bad little girl, living in sin."

1048
01:46:32,730 --> 01:46:35,756
And here I am again with you,
living in sin.

1049
01:46:38,902 --> 01:46:40,961
It's over. It's over now.

1050
01:47:01,792 --> 01:47:04,158
- Everything set?
- That's everything, sir.

1051
01:47:04,228 --> 01:47:06,890
- Thank you, Wilcox.
- Best of luck, sir.

1052
01:47:31,789 --> 01:47:33,222
Who's that?

1053
01:47:37,694 --> 01:47:40,458
Go back. Turn around.
I have to go back.

1054
01:47:43,534 --> 01:47:45,832
- Staff, immediately!
- Yes, sir.

1055
01:47:47,337 --> 01:47:49,271
Come on, quickly now!

1056
01:47:53,243 --> 01:47:55,040
I'll help with that.

1057
01:47:55,879 --> 01:47:57,346
Come on, hurry!
- Yes, sir.

1058
01:47:57,414 --> 01:47:58,779
Shall I help, Tompkins?
- Hurry!

1059
01:47:58,849 --> 01:48:02,182
The sedan chair.
- Right, very gently. Very gently.

1060
01:48:04,354 --> 01:48:06,288
Hurry.
- Get a move with the chair.

1061
01:48:06,356 --> 01:48:08,347
Come along, come along.

1062
01:48:09,226 --> 01:48:11,126
Somebody got the rug?

1063
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:14,963
Up. Gently.

1064
01:48:15,332 --> 01:48:19,029
Clear the stairs, please.
- Could I have the medical bag?

1065
01:48:21,305 --> 01:48:23,830
- Father!
- Dear Julia.

1066
01:48:24,341 --> 01:48:26,366
Come on, please. Come on!

1067
01:48:34,918 --> 01:48:36,510
I'm sorry, I was to call,

1068
01:48:36,587 --> 01:48:39,715
but we have been traveling
without a stop for three days.

1069
01:48:39,790 --> 01:48:41,815
It was Cordelia,
she was visiting us in Venice...

1070
01:48:41,892 --> 01:48:43,484
What happened?
- We want the bed ready

1071
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:44,788
as soon as possible.

1072
01:48:44,862 --> 01:48:48,855
His heart. Some long word at the heart.

1073
01:48:49,366 --> 01:48:50,663
Hurry up.

1074
01:48:51,735 --> 01:48:53,168
He's dying.

1075
01:48:54,004 --> 01:48:55,972
He has come home to die.

1076
01:49:00,511 --> 01:49:02,172
Come on, everybody, that's it.
Chop-chop.

1077
01:49:02,246 --> 01:49:03,235
Come along.

1078
01:49:03,313 --> 01:49:05,713
We must get Lord Marchmain
to the great dining room.

1079
01:49:14,825 --> 01:49:16,315
Thank you.

1080
01:49:23,734 --> 01:49:25,292
He's sleeping.

1081
01:49:27,137 --> 01:49:29,298
Do you think we should
let Sebastian know?

1082
01:49:29,373 --> 01:49:31,739
You could, but I doubt he'd come.

1083
01:49:31,808 --> 01:49:35,369
The last I heard of him,
he was still struggling rather.

1084
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:38,978
The monks have him as a porter
in the hospital in Morocco.

1085
01:49:39,049 --> 01:49:40,812
He seems to like it.

1086
01:49:40,951 --> 01:49:44,580
I think they've rather taken him
under their wing, dear old thing.

1087
01:49:44,655 --> 01:49:48,147
Still, salvation of a sort.

1088
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:53,156
Bridey, you need to call for a priest.

1089
01:49:53,997 --> 01:49:56,431
I'll have a word with Father Mackay
about dropping in this evening.

1090
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:59,196
Julia, your father doesn't want a priest.

1091
01:49:59,736 --> 01:50:02,261
All he wants is to die in his old home.

1092
01:50:02,339 --> 01:50:07,641
Our father's soul, all sinners' souls,
face mortal danger.

1093
01:50:08,645 --> 01:50:11,876
It is our duty as Catholics
to see that we do all in our power

1094
01:50:11,949 --> 01:50:15,214
to save those we love from themselves.

1095
01:50:57,394 --> 01:50:58,986
Hateful woman.

1096
01:51:00,163 --> 01:51:01,960
She wants me dead.

1097
01:51:04,635 --> 01:51:06,296
What about you?

1098
01:51:07,337 --> 01:51:10,238
- Do you want me dead?
- No.

1099
01:51:19,449 --> 01:51:22,316
You know the family
are sending for a priest.

1100
01:51:22,386 --> 01:51:25,913
They seem determined
to drag God into it.

1101
01:51:27,090 --> 01:51:29,115
Why should you care?

1102
01:51:29,826 --> 01:51:31,851
You don't believe in God.

1103
01:51:33,063 --> 01:51:34,928
You said so yourself.

1104
01:51:36,967 --> 01:51:39,731
Have you suddenly
become my conscience?

1105
01:51:41,872 --> 01:51:44,807
I've already seen Sebastian
ruined by God.

1106
01:51:44,875 --> 01:51:49,574
I don't see why I should watch it
happen again with your daughter.

1107
01:51:51,481 --> 01:51:53,813
How very caring of you.

1108
01:51:55,118 --> 01:51:57,143
You forget, I was there.

1109
01:51:58,221 --> 01:52:01,384
I watched that woman crucify my son,

1110
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:05,250
little by little, and I was silent.

1111
01:52:07,330 --> 01:52:09,821
What does that say about me?

1112
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:12,232
You're not responsible
for what she did.

1113
01:52:12,302 --> 01:52:16,068
But are we not also
our brother's keeper?

1114
01:52:17,407 --> 01:52:20,433
You, Charles, and me?

1115
01:52:23,847 --> 01:52:25,815
I let Sebastian down.

1116
01:52:28,752 --> 01:52:30,720
I let everyone down.

1117
01:52:35,325 --> 01:52:36,883
This way, sir.

1118
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:48,696
Dear, no, that's too many!

1119
01:52:48,772 --> 01:52:50,865
- Papa...
- Your father needs to rest!

1120
01:52:50,941 --> 01:52:53,136
- Get him away.
- I've brought Father Mackay to see you.

1121
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:57,237
- Get him away! Get him away!
- Out!

1122
01:52:57,314 --> 01:52:59,839
Everybody out! Out! Out!

1123
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:05,416
- I'm so sorry, Father.
- Not at all. Give him time.

1124
01:53:05,489 --> 01:53:08,652
I've known worse cases
make beautiful deaths.

1125
01:53:12,896 --> 01:53:15,660
What were you talking
to my father about?

1126
01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:21,761
He doesn't want a priest.

1127
01:53:23,974 --> 01:53:25,601
Please, Charles.

1128
01:53:26,009 --> 01:53:29,274
Please don't interfere with matters
that don't concern you.

1129
01:53:29,346 --> 01:53:30,677
Julia...

1130
01:53:34,818 --> 01:53:36,752
Let's get out of here.

1131
01:53:36,820 --> 01:53:38,583
We'll go to Italy.

1132
01:53:39,890 --> 01:53:43,053
- Capri.
- I can't leave now, my father's dying.

1133
01:53:44,461 --> 01:53:47,953
When this is over,
I can make you happy.

1134
01:54:02,979 --> 01:54:06,574
- Why should I believe you?
- Believe me.

1135
01:54:07,150 --> 01:54:09,311
You just bought me from Rex.

1136
01:54:13,723 --> 01:54:15,748
What are you talking about?

1137
01:54:15,826 --> 01:54:18,556
According to you,
I'm worth two pictures.

1138
01:54:21,364 --> 01:54:23,924
I thought I'd fetch at least three.

1139
01:54:26,102 --> 01:54:28,093
Don't be ridiculous.

1140
01:54:30,574 --> 01:54:33,475
- That was Rex.
- You agreed to it, Charles.

1141
01:54:34,177 --> 01:54:36,372
- I had no choice!
- You agreed!

1142
01:54:36,446 --> 01:54:37,470
I thought I was doing the right thing.

1143
01:54:37,547 --> 01:54:38,571
I thought I was doing what you wanted.

1144
01:54:38,648 --> 01:54:42,345
No, you thought you were getting me
and the house, together.

1145
01:54:42,419 --> 01:54:46,219
- Is that really what you think?
- You tell me. Please, tell me.

1146
01:54:46,289 --> 01:54:48,917
What does Charles Ryder really want?

1147
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:14,249
Can you imagine what it was like
for me to be invited into Brideshead?

1148
01:55:16,653 --> 01:55:17,984
Me,

1149
01:55:19,756 --> 01:55:21,519
Charles Ryder,

1150
01:55:22,659 --> 01:55:26,595
"the painter from Paddington,"
as your mother so sweetly put it.

1151
01:55:27,631 --> 01:55:30,498
There was no humiliation
I would not have endured

1152
01:55:30,567 --> 01:55:32,899
just to be part of that dream.

1153
01:55:34,271 --> 01:55:38,731
And your mother, that woman is more
alive now than she ever was.

1154
01:55:38,808 --> 01:55:43,472
She's in every brick,
every stone, every slate.

1155
01:55:48,351 --> 01:55:50,182
Sebastian was right.

1156
01:55:58,461 --> 01:56:00,452
We should run away.

1157
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:07,197
- Why did you bring me here?
- We can still leave.

1158
01:56:54,184 --> 01:56:56,812
- Bridey...
- Don't interfere, Charles.

1159
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:28,044
Now, try and remember your sins
and tell God you're sorry.

1160
01:57:28,585 --> 01:57:31,281
I'm going to give you absolution now.

1161
01:57:31,354 --> 01:57:33,151
And while I'm giving it,

1162
01:57:33,223 --> 01:57:36,215
I want you to tell God you're sorry
you offended him,

1163
01:57:36,292 --> 01:57:39,784
and then I want you
to make a sign, if you can.

1164
01:57:51,207 --> 01:57:53,198
- Amen.
- Amen.

1165
01:58:22,572 --> 01:58:23,766
Amen.

1166
01:58:39,522 --> 01:58:43,652
Please, God,
please, if you're there, forgive him.

1167
01:58:44,861 --> 01:58:49,025
Forgive me. Oh, God, forgive me.
Let him have a sign.

1168
02:00:31,334 --> 02:00:34,030
Sebastian used to loathe this painting.

1169
02:00:36,606 --> 02:00:39,541
Daddy gave it to Mummy
as a wedding present.

1170
02:00:43,246 --> 02:00:44,508
Tell me.

1171
02:00:49,452 --> 02:00:52,910
I wanted too much.

1172
02:00:55,491 --> 02:00:57,254
It's nobody's fault.

1173
02:00:57,727 --> 02:01:00,890
But you're not coming with me.

1174
02:01:06,402 --> 02:01:09,098
I can't shut myself off from His mercy.

1175
02:01:12,041 --> 02:01:14,066
Can you understand that?

1176
02:01:17,347 --> 02:01:20,475
I don't want to make it easier for you.

1177
02:01:27,890 --> 02:01:30,916
I hope your heart

1178
02:01:32,862 --> 02:01:34,227
breaks.

1179
02:01:41,337 --> 02:01:43,134
But I do understand.

1180
02:01:49,012 --> 02:01:50,843
I have to let you go.

1181
02:03:10,426 --> 02:03:14,123
Whether by fate or the
divine ironies of some higher power,

1182
02:03:15,631 --> 02:03:19,362
I find myself returned once more
to Brideshead.

1183
02:03:19,435 --> 02:03:20,959
Let it go.

1184
02:03:32,915 --> 02:03:35,782
Did I want too much?

1185
02:03:38,688 --> 02:03:40,212
Get him out of my sight!

1186
02:03:40,289 --> 02:03:44,589
Did my own hunger blind me to
the ties that bound them to their faith?

1187
02:03:47,363 --> 02:03:52,562
Am I only now, shadowed by war,
all moorings gone,

1188
02:03:55,271 --> 02:03:57,603
alone enough to see the light?

1189
02:04:05,681 --> 02:04:07,205
Worst place we've struck yet.

1190
02:04:07,283 --> 02:04:08,807
No facilities, no amenities,

1191
02:04:08,885 --> 02:04:11,718
and the nearest village
is a five-mile walk.

1192
02:04:11,788 --> 02:04:14,120
Mind you, there's a rumor
of a big push coming.

1193
02:04:14,190 --> 02:04:16,454
They'll be shipping
us off to France soon.

1194
02:04:16,526 --> 02:04:18,118
Yes, very soon.

1195
02:04:19,695 --> 02:04:22,095
Where are the family now?
Does anyone know?

1196
02:04:22,165 --> 02:04:25,134
Some Lady Flyte lives
on her own here, normally.

1197
02:04:25,201 --> 02:04:27,260
She's overseas
with the women's service.

1198
02:04:27,336 --> 02:04:31,067
Her elder brother died in the Blitz.
They're all Roman Catholic.

1199
02:04:31,674 --> 02:04:36,236
- I take it you're not religious, Hooper.
- Me? God, no. Can't see the point in it.

1200
02:04:36,312 --> 02:04:39,008
You're born, you live, then you die.

1201
02:04:42,018 --> 02:04:43,781
Do you have any hopes
for the future, Hooper?

1202
02:04:43,853 --> 02:04:45,878
Hopes? Oh, aye, plenty.

1203
02:04:46,522 --> 02:04:50,652
It's our time now. You watch.
The old ways, all this, they're gone.

1204
02:04:51,127 --> 02:04:54,392
Future belongs to us,
so long as we don't get shot.

1205
02:04:55,865 --> 02:04:57,162
How about you, sir?

1206
02:04:57,233 --> 02:04:59,098
You got someone
special waiting for you?

1207
02:04:59,168 --> 02:05:00,897
Me? No.

1208
02:05:02,004 --> 02:05:05,132
I've loved and lost
for more than one lifetime.

1209
02:05:06,809 --> 02:05:09,004
Would you like me
to drive you back, sir?

1210
02:05:09,078 --> 02:05:11,876
No, not yet. Carry on, Hooper.

1211
02:05:12,315 --> 02:05:13,907
Very good, sir.

1212
02:05:23,459 --> 02:05:25,256
Sergeant!
