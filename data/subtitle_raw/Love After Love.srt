00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:22,471
What was the question?

3
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:30,648
Um..

4
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,195
I mean, what's happy?

5
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:39,906
Really, I mean, it's..

6
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:41,031
...so arbitrary.

7
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:43,284
I... I'm... I'm..

8
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:44,494
Look, we had a fight

9
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:46,455
so I'm not, like,
"Oh..

10
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,833
...I'm happy."

11
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,002
But I'm happy.

12
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:53,880
I like Rebecca.

13
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,549
She feels like family.

14
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,890
Sometimes I feel like
she validates

15
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,685
how I feel
about the world.

16
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:10,560
I think she's smart

17
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:12,941
and that makes me
feel smart.

18
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:15,192
But..

19
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:19,489
...sometimes it feels..

20
00:02:22,658 --> 00:02:25,827
...it's all too clean.

21
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,122
You know?

22
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,751
But I'm happy.

23
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:41,093
Are you?

24
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,103
Sometimes I'm happy.

25
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:53,061
Can't always be happy.

26
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:53,982
That's true.

27
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,780
What makes you happy?

28
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:06,701
I just love my kids,
you know.

29
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:08,785
I do.

30
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:12,290
Seeing you,
I wanna see you..

31
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,878
...you know, I wanna see
you happy and fulfilled.

32
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:21,175
Just love my boys.
What can I say?

33
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,888
And your dad's
pretty good in bed too.

34
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:50,410
I need you to teach me this.

35
00:03:50,412 --> 00:03:51,411
Nah. I've got a blanket
for you.

36
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:52,706
I could do that part.

37
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:55,710
There we go.

38
00:03:59,297 --> 00:04:00,381
Alright, thank you.

39
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:10,473
Guys, this is Paul,
he's an old friend.

40
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:11,641
This is Alex, and Graham.

41
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:13,850
- Really old.
- I'm sorry.

42
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:15,727
- This is John.
- Hey, welcome, my friend.

43
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:27,157
No, check that out.

44
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,751
Hey.

45
00:04:39,753 --> 00:04:41,295
You hiding out?

46
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,088
I thought I had an hour.

47
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,383
You had it.

48
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:13,455
John.

49
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:16,290
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

50
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:22,335
Hi. Emilie.

51
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:26,131
Thank you so much.

52
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,349
- You mad at me?
- No.

53
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:39,520
Are you mad at me?

54
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:41,441
- I just wanna finish this.
- Okay.

55
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:48,571
Are you mad at me?

56
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:50,616
Oh, my God,
you're intolerable.

57
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:04,127
I love you, old man.

58
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:07,256
Uh, I love you more than
all the other old men.

59
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:08,840
Can I ask you something?

60
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:11,968
Does he, um, does he do soliloquies
when he's going down on you?

61
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,554
What are you asking?

62
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:14,638
She's fucking
what's-his-face

63
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,059
the Duke of Athens
over here.

64
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:18,309
- I did not say that! He's a freshman.
- And?

65
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,146
- I don't tolerate freshmen.
- Since when?

66
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,732
- You want wine?
- Glenn, Glenn, when do you start?

67
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:27,610
- Sorry?
- When do you actually start?

68
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:29,319
Immediately. I'll be
up there on Monday.

69
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:30,696
- Wow.
- Wow.

70
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:33,073
- Will you commute?
- If my wife has her way.

71
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:35,033
Glenn's afraid
that his marriage is over.

72
00:06:35,035 --> 00:06:38,078
- I'm not laughing.
- Uh, I'm taking this.

73
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,872
- See, this is his thing.
- Yes!

74
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:41,374
What's my thing?

75
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:44,626
Before you do something selfish,
you, like, broadcast it.

76
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:46,172
You think
it makes it okay.

77
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:51,174
We're in love, so we're
allowed to say mean things

78
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:52,175
to each other, I guess.

79
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:53,343
You're showing me tits.

80
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:55,138
There're these pictures
I made.

81
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,598
- You've got tits?
- Look.

82
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,893
It's fine.

83
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,646
- You know, it's getting dark.
- Okay.

84
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:05,148
Should probably
get 'em home.

85
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,900
When are you going
to grow up?

86
00:07:08,152 --> 00:07:09,362
Did you have any?

87
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:12,864
Have it, it's good.

88
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,158
Quit now, James.

89
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,367
So now he's affectionate.

90
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,874
She'd run
the other designer off.

91
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,417
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

92
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,335
Glenn, it's not true.
She took another job.

93
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:27,335
She went to,
I don't know where.

94
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:29,004
UT, I think.
She resigned.

95
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:31,883
Yeah, she resigned. Her
assistant was fucking her boss

96
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,134
What else
is she gonna do?

97
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:34,218
- No, it's not.
- So, what, it's true?

98
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,595
- Oh, my God. Chris.
- It's true.

99
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:38,013
No, no, it's not.
I went out with him once.

100
00:07:38,015 --> 00:07:39,598
One time.
I was an idiot.

101
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,018
I thought that, you know
he was being professional.

102
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,228
When she came along, I couldn't
sign the papers fast enough.

103
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,773
- Oh, how romantic.
- You..

104
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:48,398
You would've been
on marriage, what?

105
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,066
Your marriage number two?

106
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:52,737
Wait, wasn't that
your, uh, open marriage?

107
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,489
Yeah, she was a swinger!

108
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:57,574
- No, I wasn't!
- That's what she said. Is that not what she said?

109
00:07:57,576 --> 00:08:00,119
Being in an open marriage is not
the same thing as being a swinger.

110
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:01,746
Close enough!

111
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:02,749
Three marriages.

112
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,924
- Pear?
- I don't like pears.

113
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:17,052
No, these are,
um, poached pears.

114
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:18,929
They're not normal.

115
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,848
Great.

116
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:24,436
- Do you know what poached pears are?
- Yes.

117
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:26,272
Try one.

118
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,441
- What?
- Nothing. Go ahead.

119
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,363
- I, I'm just offering them pears.
- I see that.

120
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:38,158
"All days are nights
to see..

121
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,243
"...till I see thee.

122
00:08:41,245 --> 00:08:46,165
"And nights bright days when
dreams do show thee me.

123
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:50,627
"When most I wink, then
do mine eyes best see..

124
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:53,046
"...for all the day..

125
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:55,968
...they view things
unrespected."

126
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:01,722
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

127
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:02,973
- Beautiful, Glenn.
- Cheers.

128
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,268
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

129
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:07,437
One more time, dad.

130
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,272
Leave him alone.

131
00:09:32,754 --> 00:09:34,047
Stop it.

132
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,341
I'll bust your butt.

133
00:09:37,634 --> 00:09:39,176
- Come on, then.
- Don't think I won't.

134
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,679
- Okay.
- That sounds terrible, Glenn.

135
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,389
Yeah, he fell asleep
in the bath.

136
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:44,848
I don't feel anything.

137
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,476
- I just can't talk.
- Is that true?

138
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:48,394
Let's go.

139
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:51,021
- That's the only way he can get any rest.
- Stop it.

140
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:17,716
Hey. Thanks.

141
00:10:21,513 --> 00:10:24,012
- Hi.
- I've been circling for half an hour.

142
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:26,058
I didn't see you.

143
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:27,391
I tried calling.
You didn't pick up.

144
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,561
I, I don't have my phone.

145
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,024
Well, you could've
just parked and come in.

146
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:37,402
Well, you said you were
gonna wait outside.

147
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,075
It's good to see you too.

148
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:54,919
- Okay.
- Lift him up.

149
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,337
Alright, there you go.
There you go.

150
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,673
- That's it, dad.
- Okay.

151
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:04,681
One, two, three.

152
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,265
Ah!

153
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:16,022
Glenn, this is so
you can breathe easier.

154
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:18,694
I want you to try and
breathe through your nose.

155
00:11:21,572 --> 00:11:22,781
Okay, hold on.

156
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,701
Here you go.

157
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,793
It's okay, it's okay. This
is gonna help you breathe.

158
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,005
It's alright.

159
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:41,133
- I'll get them.
- Okay, sweetie.

160
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:45,969
Here we go.

161
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,722
If you can lift
after this. Just wait.

162
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:50,059
- One second.
- Alright. Hold on.

163
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:51,311
Okay, now.

164
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:53,646
Watch his head.

165
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:57,356
Okay, back.

166
00:11:57,358 --> 00:11:59,775
Really gentle.
There we go.

167
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:01,276
Good job, honey.

168
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,072
- It's almost done.
- There you go.

169
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,156
We're not gonna..
There you go.

170
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,324
It's okay, sweetheart.

171
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,372
Do you want me to get you
up or do you wanna sleep?

172
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,834
Mm..

173
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:01,753
You asked me
to get you up.

174
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:03,507
Just five more minutes.

175
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:16,144
I came here
to support you

176
00:13:16,146 --> 00:13:18,731
but it feels like
you don't want me around.

177
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:35,579
- You can't answer me?
- I'm, I'm sleeping.

178
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:40,170
Okay, we've got him here.

179
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,631
Okay, just give me
a second, please.

180
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:46,756
- Alright.
- Okay.

181
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:49,385
Back him up just a bit.
Please, just a bit.

182
00:13:49,387 --> 00:13:50,761
Just a bit.
There you go.

183
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,762
- Are you alright? Is that good?
- Yeah.

184
00:13:52,764 --> 00:13:55,183
There we are. Okay.

185
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:57,101
- Alright.
- Okay, you can sit him down.

186
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:01,021
- There.
- We shouldn't be in here.

187
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:03,232
- It's okay.
- He's embarrassed.

188
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:04,527
He's just sitting there.

189
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:08,112
It's humiliating.
Let's just wait. Just...

190
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,450
- Suzanne?
- Oh, thank you.

191
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:13,494
- Wait, he's falling.
- Hang on.

192
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,204
There we are. It's okay.

193
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:19,080
There we go.

194
00:14:19,082 --> 00:14:21,001
Hold on. There you go.

195
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,961
Alright.

196
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:24,881
Here we are.

197
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:35,808
I think that's it, okay?

198
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:43,608
- Alright. You ready?
- Come back up.

199
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,352
...a ride around
the back roads.

200
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,354
We always had stuff. They
had an ice cream place.

201
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,942
They hadn't had that
before they'd come home.

202
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,280
They liked to talk with
us, and we'd walk.

203
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:36,199
When you'd go away
and let them go away

204
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,160
and have a good time.

205
00:15:49,923 --> 00:15:51,799
- Oh, wait, wait.
- What?

206
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:54,176
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
cum if we keep going.

207
00:15:54,178 --> 00:15:57,137
Cum. Cum. I want you to.

208
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:58,555
You don't wanna finish?

209
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,649
Oh! Oh!

210
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:21,080
Oh. Oh. Oh.

211
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,353
Hmm..

212
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,575
- Good?
- Yeah.

213
00:17:04,748 --> 00:17:07,125
- ...fucking bed like an animal!
- Just stop, stop for a...

214
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,542
- What happened?
- Just, it's.. Wait.

215
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:10,168
- What happened?
- She restrained him.

216
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,546
What are you smiling at?

217
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:13,004
- Just.. Chris, that's enough.
- Chris. Stop that.

218
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:15,633
- I was only trying to make him comfortable.
- I'm...

219
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:16,716
- I'm not an idiot!
- Chris!

220
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:17,717
- Enough!
- I'm not making it up!

221
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:19,138
- Enough!
- Please!

222
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,932
- I'm sorry.
- No.

223
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:24,767
- I'm sorry. Okay?
- No, that's okay.

224
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:27,478
You know, you can go, I mean,
I, I really appreciate it and..

225
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,856
...thank you so much for
everything, and, uh, you know

226
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:31,816
I'll ta... I'll talk
to him. I'll talk to him.

227
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:06,768
How's the wine?

228
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,144
Anybody want
a little more?

229
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:10,437
- That white's really good.
- The white is good.

230
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:12,191
- Isn't that good?
- The red's good too.

231
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:13,942
Hey, do you want some?

232
00:18:20,574 --> 00:18:22,534
You're inconsolable.

233
00:18:23,328 --> 00:18:24,244
Huh?

234
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,707
- Like an infant.
- Can we not say mean things?

235
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,543
Inconsolable
little infant.

236
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,715
I'm not doing this, Nick.

237
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:44,387
- You're inconsolable.
- Can you stop?

238
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,767
You have determined
that you're being ignored

239
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:50,060
so you behave like this,
like an infant?

240
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,732
And so I ignore you.
What am I supposed to do?

241
00:18:59,947 --> 00:19:02,157
- I think we should go to bed.
- No!

242
00:19:08,164 --> 00:19:11,709
You are not the center of
anyone's attention right now.

243
00:19:14,712 --> 00:19:16,381
And you shouldn't be.

244
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:21,301
Full fucking stop,
Rebecca.

245
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:33,539
Ma.

246
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,791
- Hey.
- Hey, we're gonna, um..

247
00:20:35,793 --> 00:20:37,542
Sorry.

248
00:20:37,544 --> 00:20:39,878
- You're off?
- Yeah.

249
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,297
I'm sorry
I can't stay longer.

250
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:43,551
Oh, stop.
We'll see you soon.

251
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:48,013
- See you at home.
- Yeah.

252
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,108
Wait.

253
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,759
You'll wanna pick out
some clothing

254
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:11,095
that Glenn would be
comfortable in wearing.

255
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:13,097
He may have been
very involved

256
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,849
and already picked out his
clothing, I don't know.

257
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:17,976
Yes, he was
very involved.

258
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:21,563
And then lastly, we'll
follow up in a day or two

259
00:22:21,565 --> 00:22:23,941
and see how you're coping
and how you're doing.

260
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,777
- Um..
- Well, thank you.

261
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:29,532
And if there's any questions,
you know, feel free to ask me.

262
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:31,993
I don't think so.

263
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:43,890
- Hi, hi.
- Hello.

264
00:25:43,892 --> 00:25:45,559
Hello. Hi, I'm Suzanne.

265
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:47,395
- I'm Lauren. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

266
00:25:47,397 --> 00:25:50,647
- Can I take your stuff?
- Oh, thank you.

267
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,317
I'm okay.
Thank you so much.

268
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,027
- Hi, I'm Chris.
- Lauren.

269
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:57,405
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

270
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:58,947
Thanks.

271
00:25:58,949 --> 00:26:01,283
- Hey, what's your name?
- Tia.

272
00:26:01,285 --> 00:26:04,619
- Well, hello.
- Come on. Come on in, come on in.

273
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:09,125
- Hey. You got here.
- Hi. Yeah. Yeah.

274
00:26:09,127 --> 00:26:11,085
- You look great.
- You look beautiful.

275
00:26:11,087 --> 00:26:14,797
- Welcome. Hi.
- Oh, hello. Hi.

276
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,674
- Oh, hi.
- Can I introduce you..

277
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:19,760
- Hey, it's me, your brother.
- I know who you are.

278
00:26:19,762 --> 00:26:23,181
Uh, mom, this is,
uh, Greg and Margo.

279
00:26:23,183 --> 00:26:25,558
- Oh, hello. So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

280
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,185
- Suzanne.
- Yeah, it was a pleasure.

281
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:29,480
That's me. Emilie.

282
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,732
- This is for...
- Oh, I got you these. Oh, sorry.

283
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:36,234
- Thank you. You shouldn't have.
- Oh, thank you. So nice.

284
00:26:36,236 --> 00:26:38,029
- Hello there.
- Come on in, we'll have some drinks.

285
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:39,323
Oh, thank you.

286
00:26:44,661 --> 00:26:45,828
Excuse me.

287
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,746
Could I interrupt
your conversations

288
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:48,955
for just a moment?

289
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:51,416
Uh, it might be
timely for me

290
00:26:51,418 --> 00:26:54,169
to propose a toast.

291
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:57,423
Uh, we're gathered here not
just to celebrate the holidays

292
00:26:57,425 --> 00:26:59,383
but to celebrate
the engagement

293
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:03,721
of my darling youngest
daughter Emilie and Nick.

294
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:07,474
And it fills Margo and I both
with a great deal of joy

295
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:11,896
to have Nick and his family,
Suzanne and Chris here

296
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:13,815
along with our friends.

297
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:18,194
Let's raise
our glasses to... marriage

298
00:27:18,196 --> 00:27:20,738
long-lived and fruitful.

299
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,739
Hear, hear.

300
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:23,281
And to my mother.

301
00:27:23,283 --> 00:27:25,909
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

302
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:28,078
- Cheers, mom.
- Cheers.

303
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,375
- My pleasure, Nick.
- Thanks, dad.

304
00:27:34,587 --> 00:27:36,253
We moved one step ahead.

305
00:27:39,926 --> 00:27:42,095
- What.. Oh, shit.
- Whoa!

306
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:45,596
Nice one.

307
00:27:45,598 --> 00:27:48,059
Oh, I'm so sorry.

308
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:49,434
- It happens.
- It happens.

309
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:51,144
And what about you,
what do you do?

310
00:27:51,146 --> 00:27:54,271
I work at the college with Suzanne
in the, in the theatre department.

311
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:56,315
Oh, interesting.

312
00:27:56,317 --> 00:27:58,443
I... I really work
in th... this marketing

313
00:27:58,445 --> 00:28:00,153
for the plays
that they do.

314
00:28:00,155 --> 00:28:02,655
Also a little bit
of consulting for the kids

315
00:28:02,657 --> 00:28:07,827
when they're getting ready to go
out into the, the real world.

316
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:09,953
- Uh-huh.
- I used to be an actress myself.

317
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:12,999
- And Chris, what do you do? What kind of work?
- Oh. Me?

318
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:14,416
I'm, uh..

319
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:18,628
I write whatever I want that
no one will want to read.

320
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,174
- Like novels or..
- Hmm, uh, yeah.

321
00:28:21,176 --> 00:28:22,760
But, very, very short.

322
00:28:24,637 --> 00:28:28,263
Oh, come on, dad. You were
such a hippie back in the day.

323
00:28:28,265 --> 00:28:32,309
It's the shop, it's
like coming up off Craigslist.

324
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:37,607
We didn't celebrate our weddings
by getting goofy on mushrooms.

325
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:38,732
It's you.

326
00:28:38,734 --> 00:28:40,859
- No. Really?
- People do this.

327
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:43,820
I shouldn't be laughing.

328
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,615
- I think it's a good..
- Sorry.

329
00:28:45,617 --> 00:28:46,991
...bonding experience

330
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:48,784
and to bring the family
together, I don't know.

331
00:28:48,786 --> 00:28:50,494
I don't think
it's funny.

332
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:52,204
- No, I think it's.. Okay. I get..
- I'm excited.

333
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:53,998
- You were excited.
- I am excited.

334
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,334
- Okay.
- I get that it's, it's unusual.

335
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:58,168
But, that's okay.

336
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,338
We're okay with people..

337
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,130
...being confused by it.

338
00:29:02,132 --> 00:29:03,174
I mean, I think the..

339
00:29:07,138 --> 00:29:08,721
What are these?

340
00:29:08,723 --> 00:29:11,348
These are Italian
wedding cookies.

341
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,561
- Well, can I have one?
- Yeah.

342
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:16,855
Do you guys work here?

343
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:20,774
- Here?
- Like, all the time?

344
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:24,363
Uh, we work for the catering
company, if that's what you mean.

345
00:29:26,573 --> 00:29:27,783
Yeah.

346
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,040
Good.

347
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:39,628
♪ Feel so nice
right on.. ♪

348
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,185
I haven't even
seen your ring.

349
00:29:57,187 --> 00:29:58,646
There isn't one.

350
00:29:58,648 --> 00:30:00,440
What, you haven't
got a ring?

351
00:30:00,442 --> 00:30:03,776
- No, we got earrings.
- Show 'em off, will you?

352
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:05,069
That's so pretty.

353
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:07,238
She told me what she
wanted, we went together.

354
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,407
Oh.

355
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,414
- Doesn't she look pretty?
- Stop.

356
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:18,749
- Right, mom?
- She's beautiful.

357
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:20,251
- Great.
- See?

358
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:24,924
- I didn't see the earrings.
- Hmm.

359
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,887
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

- What's up?

00:31:29,656 --> 00:31:32,447
I want to tell you that..

376
00:31:32,449 --> 00:31:34,575
...I'm proud of you.

377
00:31:34,577 --> 00:31:37,078
And, I love you.

378
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,038
Okay. Okay, Chris.

379
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,332
And, uh, and I'm just
really proud of you.

380
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,835
I know. I just..

381
00:31:43,837 --> 00:31:46,087
Thanks, man. Thank you.

382
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:48,338
- I love you.
- Thank you.

383
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,508
You're welcome.

384
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:52,009
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh!

385
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:53,845
Ah!

386
00:31:53,847 --> 00:31:56,138
- Are you okay?
- Ow!

387
00:31:57,225 --> 00:31:59,015
- Alright.
- Nicholas has got me.

388
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,017
Okay.

389
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,021
- Oh, wow.
- Take it easy. Okay.

390
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,732
- You had a little fall there.
- Yeah.

391
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:09,026
You're good.

392
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:11,404
- Because he's the good one.
- Alright.

393
00:32:11,406 --> 00:32:13,239
- I think we got it.
- You're the good one.

394
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:15,366
- Uh-huh.
- You can't hear enough of it.

395
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:16,783
You're the good one.

396
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:20,996
- You're good too. Sometimes.
- Aww, I'm okay.

397
00:32:20,998 --> 00:32:23,331
- You wanna sit down?
- I don't wanna sit down.

398
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,876
That's a bad idea.

399
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:29,213
- You wanna lie down?
- I wanna... pee.

400
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:31,840
I just wanna pee
and then it's fine.

401
00:32:31,842 --> 00:32:33,550
- I'm gonna go pee.
- You need a hand with that?

402
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:34,720
I am so sorry.

403
00:32:35,804 --> 00:32:37,053
I'm so sorry.

404
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,932
- You okay, buddy?
- I'm... I'm... I'm okay.

405
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:40,894
Yeah?

406
00:32:42,853 --> 00:32:44,729
Then, they..
That's..

407
00:32:44,731 --> 00:32:45,815
It's good.

408
00:32:50,028 --> 00:32:52,238
Someone's gonna carry him
home tonight.

409
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,241
You okay, man?

410
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:06,460
Chris, what are you doing?

411
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:08,543
Chris!

412
00:33:08,545 --> 00:33:10,378
Stop it.
Jesus! Are you..

413
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,798
- Get outta here!
- Damn it!

414
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,299
What are you doing?

415
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:14,424
- Oh, shit.
- Mom!

416
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:15,926
Okay, I'm going!

417
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:18,637
- I am sorry to you.
- Sit down.

418
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:20,306
- I'm so sorry.
- Whoa!

419
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:21,307
I... I'm...

420
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:22,433
Uh, it was like

421
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:24,059
a dog food commercial.

422
00:33:24,061 --> 00:33:25,228
Oh, no.

423
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,771
It was
a dog food commercial

424
00:33:26,773 --> 00:33:28,271
and, um, I was a..

425
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:30,607
- Wet or dry?
- Um..

426
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,484
Didn't get that far. That
was in the callback.

427
00:33:32,486 --> 00:33:35,613
- You didn't get that far?
- Yeah, they had, like, plastic dog food.

428
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:36,905
And I was, like,
a dog owner

429
00:33:36,907 --> 00:33:38,616
and I was supposed
to be with my dog, like

430
00:33:38,618 --> 00:33:40,451
"You like it? I like it."

431
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:42,744
And, um, it was
so humiliating, right?

432
00:33:42,746 --> 00:33:44,621
'Cause it was, like,
plastic dog food.

433
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,290
- Yeah.
- Was there a real dog?

434
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:49,710
No. It was a fucking
shaggy puppet dog.

435
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:53,463
And I went.. I slumped over visibly.
I was just like..

436
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:56,800
And he put his hand on my
shoulder and he was like

437
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:58,469
"I know, man. I know."

438
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:00,262
- Oh, man, Chris.
- And then, that's it. That was..

439
00:34:00,264 --> 00:34:02,223
Were you supposed to make a
face, like, you didn't like it?

440
00:34:02,225 --> 00:34:04,099
- Or you liked it?
- No, you were supposed to like it.

441
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:06,726
It was, like, "Can you give me one where
you just really love this stuff?"

442
00:34:06,728 --> 00:34:08,395
I don't understand
this commercial.

443
00:34:08,397 --> 00:34:09,813
- Yeah, it doesn't make sense.
- The commercial is...

444
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:12,150
Yeah, it's their fault.
They're a bunch of idiots.

445
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:13,942
I came in
as a true artist.

446
00:34:13,944 --> 00:34:17,822
It sounds like it's actually a
snack for dogs and, and humans.

447
00:34:17,824 --> 00:34:21,159
I read the proposal, but for the
benefit of my colleagues here

448
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:26,121
can you explain, um, how you
see it as a hybrid of memoir

449
00:34:26,123 --> 00:34:29,166
and, and history
of Shepard Stuyvesant?

450
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:33,337
Uh, well, it intersperses chapters
that are taken from my own life.

451
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:38,800
Yet I think, there's also a historical
and critical element that, um..

452
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:43,306
...that really, I think, kinda
marries itself to the memoir section

453
00:34:43,308 --> 00:34:47,353
in a way that's unique and I
think will speak to readers.

454
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,855
Do you think
it will upset..

455
00:34:56,029 --> 00:34:58,654
- They're all their life?
- I think so.

456
00:34:58,656 --> 00:35:01,199
And I think that I'm trying
to speak to that line.

457
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:02,407
You're.. Are you
straddling that line?

458
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:03,659
I think I'm on the line.

459
00:35:03,661 --> 00:35:05,119
- You're on the line?
- I am the line.

460
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:06,871
You are the line. Okay.

461
00:35:06,873 --> 00:35:10,833
And besides yourself, what other
characters feature in the book?

462
00:35:10,835 --> 00:35:13,376
Well, there's historical
figures, so there's James Weeks

463
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:15,545
who founded
the Weeksville settlement.

464
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:18,715
Um, there's
my roommates, who..

465
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:22,429
Um, I don't know, it's really a..
That's a Diego question.

466
00:35:23,223 --> 00:35:24,808
Or Rebecca. She's in..

467
00:35:26,351 --> 00:35:28,558
Uh..

468
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,395
Well,
by day's end at least.

469
00:35:32,107 --> 00:35:34,898
No, I... I... I like it,
too. I just..

470
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,527
No, but that's... that's what I'm saying.
I like it too.

471
00:35:37,529 --> 00:35:39,027
I just can't go
any further until

472
00:35:39,029 --> 00:35:42,572
we have a... a... proper
conversation about it.

473
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:43,909
No, with everybody.

474
00:35:51,918 --> 00:35:55,335
- Knock, knock.
- Hey! Nick said you were here.

475
00:35:55,337 --> 00:35:58,924
- He's stuck on the phone.
- Oh. Come in, come in.

476
00:36:01,636 --> 00:36:05,429
Honestly, I... I... I don't even
care if it is. That's your problem.

477
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:06,683
Yeah, I heard that.

478
00:36:12,272 --> 00:36:13,355
All set?

479
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,605
Okay.

480
00:36:17,527 --> 00:36:20,612
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

481
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:52,119
Suzanne, they're ready
for you downstairs.

482
00:37:52,121 --> 00:37:53,705
Okay, I'll be right down.

483
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,208
"Yes, we shall live,
Uncle Vanya.

484
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,878
"We shall live all through the
endless procession of days

485
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,172
"ahead of us and through
the long evenings.

486
00:38:04,174 --> 00:38:08,719
"We shall bear patiently the
burdens that fate imposes on us.

487
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:13,266
"We shall work without rest for
others, both now and when we are old.

488
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:15,393
"And when our
final hour comes..

489
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:17,228
"...we shall meet it
humbly..

490
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,563
"...and there,
beyond the grave

491
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:22,900
we will say that we have known
tears and suffering ..."

492
00:38:22,902 --> 00:38:23,900
Okay. very good.

493
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,402
Um, Thank you, Ashleigh.

494
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,279
Uh, that's, uh..

495
00:38:27,281 --> 00:38:28,907
Who... who wants
to go first?

496
00:38:30,284 --> 00:38:32,578
- Suzanne?
- I have nothing to say.

497
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:35,747
- Is that good?
- No.

498
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,208
O... okay. Is that all
you're gonna say?

499
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,545
We've done this once a semester
for three years, Ashleigh.

500
00:38:42,547 --> 00:38:44,380
Done what?

501
00:38:44,382 --> 00:38:49,594
This is not the outfit of someone who
takes herself or her work seriously.

502
00:38:49,596 --> 00:38:51,429
- Oh, come on, Suzanne.
- Excuse me.

503
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:53,723
I take this very,
very seriously.

504
00:38:53,725 --> 00:38:55,558
And I'm trying
really hard.

505
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,933
Oh, Lord, help me.

506
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,143
Why are you so mad?

507
00:38:58,145 --> 00:38:59,603
If you want me to wear
a sweater, I will.

508
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:01,688
I don't want you
to do anything.

509
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,608
- Why are you yelling at me?
- I'm not yelling...

510
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,817
Yes, you are.

511
00:39:04,819 --> 00:39:06,067
- You're yelling at me.
- I'm not yelling at you.

512
00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:07,069
I'm trying to help you.

513
00:39:07,071 --> 00:39:08,612
Okay, um..

514
00:39:08,614 --> 00:39:10,782
- Suzanne, I think your point's been made.
- Scott! Stop it.

515
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:12,032
Let's just move on.
Karen. What?

516
00:39:12,034 --> 00:39:14,242
- Stop undermining me.
- Oh, okay.

517
00:39:14,244 --> 00:39:15,578
Thank you.

518
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,829
I'm sorry, Karen.

519
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:19,456
- It's okay.
- Go ahead.

520
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:22,920
I... I don't think the
outfit is, is that bad.

521
00:39:24,964 --> 00:39:28,299
If we're approaching this
practically, we have to be open

522
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:31,636
and... and supportive of the
possibility that, in some cases

523
00:39:31,638 --> 00:39:35,306
and certainly for a beginning
actor, especially for a woman

524
00:39:35,308 --> 00:39:38,266
there is a certain value placed
on physical appearance...

525
00:39:38,268 --> 00:39:39,559
I don't know
what I'm doing here

526
00:39:39,561 --> 00:39:41,770
if I can't expect support
from my colleagues.

527
00:39:41,772 --> 00:39:43,313
Oh, I'm not dismissing
your point...

528
00:39:43,315 --> 00:39:45,983
I hate the way that
you are speaking to me.

529
00:39:45,985 --> 00:39:48,196
- Either of you! Fuck!
- Suzanne.

530
00:39:49,656 --> 00:39:51,116
- Fuck!
- Suzanne.

531
00:39:56,663 --> 00:39:58,411
It's alright.
It's alright.

532
00:40:03,377 --> 00:40:04,835
It's alright.

533
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:08,088
- Sorry.
- It's okay. Really.

534
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,842
Crazy, but it's okay.

535
00:40:14,429 --> 00:40:16,429
I said, "One more tantrum
and that's it."

536
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:18,474
So..

537
00:40:18,476 --> 00:40:19,683
...sure enough,
10 minutes in

538
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:21,476
he starts going off
on Jane...

539
00:40:21,478 --> 00:40:24,313
Were you in on the cooking
at all? No?

540
00:40:24,315 --> 00:40:27,608
I just said, I stopped the
meeting and I said, "Excuse me."

541
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:31,027
And I said, you know, "Tim,
can we go out in the hall?"

542
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:32,989
We walked out,
about five feet down

543
00:40:32,991 --> 00:40:34,824
and I just... just, I may
have said a word to him

544
00:40:34,826 --> 00:40:37,994
but I swiveled back
in the room

545
00:40:37,996 --> 00:40:39,579
and I locked the door.

546
00:40:39,581 --> 00:40:40,704
And I just continued
the meeting.

547
00:40:40,706 --> 00:40:41,998
We had a pretty
long agenda.

548
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,126
You know, we got the..

549
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:48,212
How we doing tonight,
folks? Alright.

550
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:51,047
How are you tonight? 102, right
straight through, please.

551
00:41:07,984 --> 00:41:10,235
Okay. At the end of their life.

552
00:41:25,543 --> 00:41:26,795
Sorry.

553
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:30,712
Foul! Foul! Foul!

554
00:41:30,714 --> 00:41:34,007
You're outta your mind.
You're outta your mind.

555
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:37,094
No! Come on,
get your act together!

556
00:41:39,056 --> 00:41:42,599
Defense!
Defense!

557
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:44,061
Oh, the kiss cam!

558
00:41:45,563 --> 00:41:46,606
The kiss cam.

559
00:41:47,857 --> 00:41:49,232

00:41:57,826 --> 00:42:00,954

00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,956

00:42:07,752 --> 00:42:09,960
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it does.

565
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:11,503
No doubt about it.

566
00:42:11,505 --> 00:42:14,466
I'm not a beer connoisseur
or anything, but..

567
00:42:24,143 --> 00:42:26,476
You can say somethin'.

568
00:42:26,478 --> 00:42:27,938
What?

569
00:42:34,237 --> 00:42:35,572
We can talk, you know.

570
00:42:36,906 --> 00:42:39,032
I don't... I don't know
what to say.

571
00:42:41,201 --> 00:42:43,580
I feel like I'm,
I'm havin' an affair.

572
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:13,023
Hey. I'm, uh, brewing
some tea. You want some?

573
00:43:13,025 --> 00:43:15,942
- Yeah, that sounds nice.
- Okay.

00:43:15,944 --> 00:43:18,237

Hey. You're here.

583
00:44:38,194 --> 00:44:39,320
I just walked in.

584
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:42,070
What's going on?
You repainting?

585
00:44:42,072 --> 00:44:43,989
I told you that.

586
00:44:43,991 --> 00:44:45,284
No, you didn't.

587
00:44:46,453 --> 00:44:47,954
Well, I'm repainting.

588
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,248
I thought Emilie
was coming.

589
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,375
She's on the phone.

590
00:44:54,377 --> 00:44:56,045
She booked a commercial.

591
00:44:59,715 --> 00:45:00,967
Why are these here?

592
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:03,842
- Ma?
- What?

593
00:45:03,844 --> 00:45:07,304
- Did you hear me?
- Yes, Nicholas, I heard you.

594
00:45:07,306 --> 00:45:11,141
Well, don't just throw
my things away, okay?

595
00:45:11,143 --> 00:45:14,478
- I live here too.
- You do not live here.

596
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,484
"Lived."
I said "lived."

597
00:45:28,203 --> 00:45:29,244
Come on.

598
00:45:50,141 --> 00:45:51,434
We made coffee.

599
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:56,397
Thank you.

600
00:45:58,942 --> 00:46:01,735
- Do you want some?
- No thanks.

601
00:46:21,172 --> 00:46:23,338
This is fine, right?

602
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,634
Of course.

603
00:46:42,235 --> 00:46:44,652
- Who was it?
- A package.

604
00:46:44,654 --> 00:46:45,945
For me?
What is it?

605
00:46:45,947 --> 00:46:49,157
Ah, feels like books.

606
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:51,035
Did you order books?

607
00:46:59,668 --> 00:47:02,337
- Is this for now?
- It is if you want it.

608
00:47:07,259 --> 00:47:08,594
Um..

609
00:47:26,779 --> 00:47:29,573
I got a letter from
Rebecca the other day.

610
00:47:36,038 --> 00:47:38,790
It must be hard on her
havin' you in the office.

611
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:41,708
No. We don't
really interact.

612
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,545
Our departments
are separate now.

613
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:45,964
Still.

614
00:47:47,132 --> 00:47:49,343
It's actually easier now
than it was before.

615
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:52,677
What does that mean?

616
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:56,766
Just the whole thing
was such an effort.

617
00:47:56,768 --> 00:47:58,645
We were always trying.

618
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,482
Not in the beginning.

619
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,152
In the beginning,
you were in love

620
00:48:08,154 --> 00:48:09,614
I don't think so.

621
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:13,699
I was there.

622
00:48:13,701 --> 00:48:16,159
Okay.

623
00:48:16,161 --> 00:48:18,411
If she didn't return your calls,
you were out of your mind.

624
00:48:18,413 --> 00:48:20,332
- You were distraught.
- Okay.

625
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:25,085
- I was never distraught.
- You were obsessed.

626
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,130
- That's your word.
- I wanted her to love me.

627
00:48:28,132 --> 00:48:30,007
That's not the same
as falling in love.

628
00:48:30,009 --> 00:48:31,677
It was like a goal.

629
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,189
Rebecca was a person
of real consequence.

630
00:48:48,652 --> 00:48:51,027
- Okay.
- What?

631
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:53,530
What?
What do you mean "what?"

632
00:48:53,532 --> 00:48:56,159
Why do you wanna
do this now?

633
00:48:56,161 --> 00:48:58,326
Why do you always
fucking do this?

634
00:48:58,328 --> 00:49:01,371
Jesus. "A person
of real consequence?"

635
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:03,623
What the fuck is that?

636
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:06,585
- You mean as in Emilie is not that?
- Excuse me.

637
00:49:06,587 --> 00:49:08,837
- Who said anything about Emilie?
- Oh, please.

638
00:49:08,839 --> 00:49:11,047
- I didn't. I don't even know Emilie.
- Okay.

639
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:13,550
So don't try to weasel
some opinion out of me.

640
00:49:13,552 --> 00:49:15,887
If I want to say somethin'
about Emilie, I'll say it.

641
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,978
And this is
the living room.

642
00:50:07,773 --> 00:50:11,233
Oh.
Oh, the ceilings.

643
00:50:11,235 --> 00:50:13,527
- Pretty great, huh?
- Great light.

644
00:50:13,529 --> 00:50:15,862
- Such good light.
- We love it.

645
00:50:15,864 --> 00:50:18,782
Oh, those bay windows.

646
00:50:18,784 --> 00:50:20,034
Yeah, we're really lucky.

647
00:50:20,036 --> 00:50:21,369
Do you have the backyard?

648
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:23,161
- Yeah.
- We share it.

649
00:50:23,163 --> 00:50:24,288
- Share it?
- Uh-huh.

650
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:26,875
But still. Very nice.

651
00:50:42,141 --> 00:50:45,978
Do your... kids ask
where you go?

652
00:50:48,105 --> 00:50:49,982
They're not really
interested.

653
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,359
- Sure, now.
- I know.

654
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:11,457
Do you hate me tonight?

655
00:53:13,375 --> 00:53:15,375
What?

656
00:53:15,377 --> 00:53:16,753
Do you hate me?

657
00:53:23,261 --> 00:53:24,512
Of course not.

658
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:35,106
Do you hate me?

659
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,736
- I'm very hateable.
- No.

660
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:44,824
Then there's no hate.

661
00:53:57,295 --> 00:53:59,255
Hope I hate anybody.

662
00:54:18,398 --> 00:54:20,690
I can't stick it out.
Is that okay?

663
00:54:20,692 --> 00:54:22,610
Mm. There's nothing
to do now.

664
00:54:22,612 --> 00:54:24,570
I'm just re-reading
her emails.

665
00:54:24,572 --> 00:54:26,864
- She's an idiot.
- You want me to call Paul?

666
00:54:26,866 --> 00:54:29,866
- No.
- Wait, are you angry?

667
00:54:29,868 --> 00:54:32,161
It's the second time she's pushed.
She's being a shit.

668
00:54:32,163 --> 00:54:33,996
Yeah.
She's just embarrassed.

669
00:54:33,998 --> 00:54:36,876
She'll send you a long
apology email tomorrow.

670
00:54:38,418 --> 00:54:40,672
I left some Szechwan
in the fridge.

671
00:54:43,257 --> 00:54:44,507
You hear me?

672
00:54:44,509 --> 00:54:46,259
- Are you leaving now?
- Uh-huh.

673
00:54:46,261 --> 00:54:48,596
I'll walk down with you.
I called a car.

674
00:54:50,264 --> 00:54:51,639
Are you taking
the train?

675
00:54:51,641 --> 00:54:53,516
Yeah, traffic's
gonna be shitty.

676
00:54:53,518 --> 00:54:55,101
Okay. Well,
I'll see you later.

677
00:54:55,103 --> 00:54:56,146
Night.

678
00:54:59,107 --> 00:55:01,148
Hi. Thanks.

679
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:02,734
Do you have the address?

680
00:55:05,487 --> 00:55:07,237
Whoa, whoa.
I'm sorry.

681
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:09,407
- What are you doing?
- Whoa!

682
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:13,034
I just, uh, I realized I
don't have anywhere to be.

683
00:55:13,036 --> 00:55:15,579
So I thought I could just
ride with you and..

684
00:55:15,581 --> 00:55:18,666
Drop you off and take the
car home, if that's okay.

685
00:55:18,668 --> 00:55:20,753
- Okay. Yeah.
- Great.

686
00:55:25,717 --> 00:55:27,257
I mean, we should probably
have an answer if we're goin'

687
00:55:27,259 --> 00:55:29,509
in the morning anyway,
right?

688
00:55:29,511 --> 00:55:30,596
Uh-huh.

689
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:44,903
What?

690
00:55:47,112 --> 00:55:49,279
I.. I don't know,
it's just..

691
00:55:49,281 --> 00:55:51,866
- I'm having a...
- I know.

692
00:55:51,868 --> 00:55:52,951
You know what?

693
00:55:53,828 --> 00:55:55,079
Like..

694
00:55:56,371 --> 00:55:58,457
...like, emotional spins,
right?

695
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:02,211
- Emotional spins?
- Yeah.

696
00:56:03,962 --> 00:56:06,256
I don't even know
what that is.

697
00:56:24,484 --> 00:56:26,817
- So, um..
- Goodbye, Nick.

698
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:28,696
Alright.
See you tomorrow.

699
00:56:31,406 --> 00:56:33,574
Goodnight, Nicholas.

700
00:56:33,576 --> 00:56:36,576
Uh, Becca,
just wait a second.

701
00:56:36,578 --> 00:56:39,413
- Nick, this is weird.
- No, it's not.

702
00:56:39,415 --> 00:56:41,081
I'll see you tomorrow.
Just go home.

703
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:43,166
I just, I need
to use the bathroom.

704
00:56:43,168 --> 00:56:45,460
- Whose bathroom?
- I'll be fast.

705
00:56:45,462 --> 00:56:47,337
- No, you can't come up.
- Why not?

706
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:49,632
Nick, go.

707
00:56:49,634 --> 00:56:51,300
Why are you being like..

708
00:56:51,302 --> 00:56:53,511
I'm..
We're just talking.

709
00:56:53,513 --> 00:56:55,637
What, I can't
talk to you now?

710
00:56:55,639 --> 00:56:58,099
Okay, fine, fine,
but don't leave like this.

711
00:56:58,101 --> 00:57:00,476
I'm not leaving like anything.
I'm going to my apartment.

712
00:57:00,478 --> 00:57:01,768
You can't just stop
for a second?

713
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:03,980
Go home, Nick.

714
00:57:03,982 --> 00:57:05,692
You're making this worse.

715
00:57:06,609 --> 00:57:09,025
Okay, come on.
Becca.

716
00:57:09,027 --> 00:57:12,697
- Come on! Rebecca!
- Oh, my God! Enough!

717
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:14,114
What, you're just gonna
leave like this?

718
00:57:14,116 --> 00:57:15,741
- Come on, let's go.
- Nice, Rebecca!

719
00:57:15,743 --> 00:57:18,286
Real fuckin' nice!
Nice job!

720
00:57:18,288 --> 00:57:19,871
- Hey, come on.
- Oh, fuck off!

721
00:57:19,873 --> 00:57:22,831
...old people next to, or,
like, at the same table

722
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:25,668
as other people, and it
was kind of a disaster.

723
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:28,170
I'd have like hives up and
down my arms that's what..

724
00:57:28,172 --> 00:57:31,047
That's what they gave me
the Benadryl for.

725
00:57:31,049 --> 00:57:32,842
- Yeah.
- Um, yeah.

726
00:57:32,844 --> 00:57:35,761
I didn't last too long
there, I loved it.

727
00:57:35,763 --> 00:57:37,889
I stole their muffins.
Do you remember them?

728
00:57:37,891 --> 00:57:41,308
I think that's a classic server
move to steal all muffins.

729
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:42,976
All muffins
should be always stolen.

730
00:57:42,978 --> 00:57:44,395
Yeah.

731
00:57:44,397 --> 00:57:46,898
That's crazy, though,
so when..

732
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,650
...when you were, like, serving people,
you had, like, hives on your...

733
00:57:49,652 --> 00:57:52,652
I don't know what it was. I think
I was just allergic to something.

734
00:57:52,654 --> 00:57:55,405
It wasn't the cleanest..

735
00:57:55,407 --> 00:57:56,991
...diner experience.

736
00:57:56,993 --> 00:57:58,617
You should have seen
the place we stayed.

737
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:01,286
- She wanted to move in.
- Oh, it was unbelievable.

738
00:58:01,288 --> 00:58:03,581
Old original architecture
with this beautiful balcony.

739
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:05,877
You know, it just feels like
you're in another country.

740
00:58:07,252 --> 00:58:09,503
God, that smells good.

741
00:58:09,505 --> 00:58:11,257
Make some room over there.

742
00:58:13,884 --> 00:58:16,886
Here, let's just
put that down there.

743
00:58:16,888 --> 00:58:19,596
Yeah, there.. Yeah, there are all
those weird people who just don't..

744
00:58:19,598 --> 00:58:21,224
- May I?
- I ju.. I... I..

745
00:58:21,226 --> 00:58:23,643
- Don't use money, I guess.
- Thanks.

746
00:58:23,645 --> 00:58:25,478
I don't know.

747
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,273
You decide, Karen.

748
00:58:28,857 --> 00:58:31,483
- Mm-hmm.
- I have friends who live there.

749
00:58:31,485 --> 00:58:33,277
Terrific music.

750
00:58:33,279 --> 00:58:35,070
Michael loves jazz.

751
00:58:35,072 --> 00:58:36,947
Always have.

752
00:58:36,949 --> 00:58:39,368
I mean, Coltrane, Monk,
you know.

753
00:58:40,453 --> 00:58:44,038
Uh, I even like bad jazz,
really.

754
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,581
It was so.. It was just so funny,
you know, he... he... he..

755
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,668
We would go looking for
these out-of-way places.

756
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,378
He would go up to people
on the street.

757
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:54,172
I didn't want to get trapped
in the touristy places.

758
00:58:54,174 --> 00:58:55,342
You know..

759
00:58:56,386 --> 00:58:57,969
I mean,
you're in New Orleans.

760
00:58:57,971 --> 00:58:59,177
I wanted the real thing.

761
00:58:59,179 --> 00:59:00,762
Do you know a man

762
00:59:00,764 --> 00:59:03,266
who has been in love
with only one woman?

763
00:59:03,268 --> 00:59:05,311
There certainly
are such men.

764
00:59:06,311 --> 00:59:09,188
Are they amongst
your friends?

765
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:10,565
Tell me his name.

766
00:59:10,567 --> 00:59:12,567
I have no name
to tell you

767
00:59:12,569 --> 00:59:14,067
but I do believe
that there are men

768
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:16,154
capable of loving..

769
00:59:16,156 --> 00:59:17,489
...but once.

770
00:59:18,991 --> 00:59:21,743
How often
can a true man love?

771
00:59:23,288 --> 00:59:25,704
What are you trying
to find out?

772
00:59:25,706 --> 00:59:27,833
Ask.
I'll answer it.

773
00:59:30,837 --> 00:59:33,047
Am I right to stay
in the convent?

774
00:59:34,507 --> 00:59:36,340
No.

775
00:59:36,342 --> 00:59:38,592
- Cool, right?
- Yeah, I liked it.

776
00:59:38,594 --> 00:59:40,638
I've never been
backstage before.

777
00:59:41,889 --> 00:59:43,681
Oh, there he is.

778
00:59:43,683 --> 00:59:45,599
- Oh. Matthew.
- Hey.

779
00:59:45,601 --> 00:59:47,518
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you!

780
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,645
- You were just wonderful.
- Thank you. I think it went pretty well.

781
00:59:49,647 --> 00:59:51,855
So do I. Matthew,
this is my friend Michael.

782
00:59:51,857 --> 00:59:52,982
Michael, this is Matthew.

783
00:59:52,984 --> 00:59:54,525
- He played Perdican.
- Of course.

784
00:59:54,527 --> 00:59:55,902
- Hey!
- Hey!

785
00:59:55,904 --> 00:59:57,652
- You were awesome.
- Thank you!

786
00:59:57,654 --> 00:59:59,864
Ashleigh, you were fantastic.
It was great.

787
00:59:59,866 --> 01:00:02,032
Oh, thank you.
Hi, I'm Ashleigh.

788
01:00:02,034 --> 01:00:03,659
- Hi. Michael.

I thought I had them
in this pocket.

830
01:02:37,107 --> 01:02:39,232
- What, your phone?
- No, my keys.

831
01:02:39,234 --> 01:02:40,358
- My house key.
- Oh, no.

832
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,445
- You lost them?
- Oh, got it.

833
01:02:44,447 --> 01:02:46,032
Um..

834
01:03:34,246 --> 01:03:36,581
Hey.

835
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:39,335
- Why are you up?
- It's morning.

836
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:47,175
Where were you?

837
01:03:47,177 --> 01:03:50,096
Oh, I just, uh,
took Karen home.

838
01:03:51,096 --> 01:03:53,598
How is she?

839
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,018
Nicholas.

840
01:03:56,435 --> 01:03:58,270
How is Karen?

841
01:03:59,272 --> 01:04:01,438
Uh, I don't know
what you mean.

842
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,900
You don't?

843
01:04:04,777 --> 01:04:06,361
She's alive.

844
01:04:08,989 --> 01:04:10,491
Come on, Max.

845
01:04:13,578 --> 01:04:16,288
Uh, what time
did you guys get in?

846
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:21,958
Ma? You're not gonna
answer me?

847
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,337
What does it matter
what time we got in?

848
01:04:24,339 --> 01:04:25,965
Why are you pissed?

849
01:04:29,636 --> 01:04:32,096
Well, good morning.

850
01:04:33,848 --> 01:04:35,558
You smell.

851
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:40,143
Okay.

852
01:04:40,145 --> 01:04:42,439
Well,
I'm going to go to bed.

853
01:05:31,239 --> 01:05:33,780
I did that. Yeah.

854
01:05:35,118 --> 01:05:36,992
- I loved that job.
- You did?

855
01:05:36,994 --> 01:05:38,786
Yeah, I actually did.
Like..

856
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:44,461
Let's see.
Let's give you this one.

857
01:05:49,382 --> 01:05:51,176
Hey, Miss Floy.

858
01:05:52,886 --> 01:05:54,302
Mm!

859
01:05:54,304 --> 01:05:56,055
- Look who it is.
- Hey.

860
01:05:59,058 --> 01:06:01,768
I'll take that.
Is this free?

861
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:03,268
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'm gonna use this.

862
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:05,480
That's just
orange juice there.

863
01:06:05,482 --> 01:06:06,521
Aren't you hot?

864
01:06:06,523 --> 01:06:09,150
You're wearing
a sweater too.

865
01:06:09,152 --> 01:06:10,487
Hey.

866
01:06:12,906 --> 01:06:14,574
- You want some juice?
- Yeah.

867
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:22,706
Perfect.

868
01:06:27,628 --> 01:06:28,920
Um, silverware?

869
01:06:28,922 --> 01:06:31,797
Oh, this,
this drawer right here.

870
01:06:34,092 --> 01:06:35,509
Last night..

871
01:06:35,511 --> 01:06:37,513
What do you think
of this guy?

872
01:06:39,098 --> 01:06:40,764
It should be
the other way around.

873
01:06:40,766 --> 01:06:43,141
- Michael?
- No.

874
01:06:43,143 --> 01:06:44,395
Um..

875
01:06:45,772 --> 01:06:49,190
I don't know.
He's nice enough, right?

876
01:06:49,192 --> 01:06:51,025
- I feel bad.
- No, you're fine.

877
01:06:51,027 --> 01:06:53,569
And if that's
the real question or not.

878
01:06:53,571 --> 01:06:54,945
If it is..

879
01:06:54,947 --> 01:06:57,116
I don't know
how to behave.

880
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:06,791
- Chris, can you get these?
- Yeah.

881
01:07:06,793 --> 01:07:09,626
- I can do it.
- Chris!

882
01:07:09,628 --> 01:07:11,337
- Ma, I'm doing it.
- What?

883
01:07:11,339 --> 01:07:12,674
He's doing it.

884
01:07:14,509 --> 01:07:16,007
You hear her?

885
01:07:16,009 --> 01:07:17,302
What?

886
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:21,639
Oh,
who needs some coffee?

887
01:07:21,641 --> 01:07:24,766
- I'll have one.
- I have some.

888
01:07:24,768 --> 01:07:26,936
We should say
something.

889
01:07:26,938 --> 01:07:29,563
- I think...
- No, no, I think I'm gonna say something.

890
01:07:29,565 --> 01:07:31,023
No, no, no, no.
It's fine.

891
01:07:31,025 --> 01:07:33,067
What? No, no, no, no.
Just a little.

892
01:07:35,779 --> 01:07:37,697
I just want to say
a little something

893
01:07:37,699 --> 01:07:41,159
in honor of our
new guest.

894
01:07:41,161 --> 01:07:44,161
Happy birthday,
Michael.

895
01:07:44,163 --> 01:07:46,413
We are very happy
to have you here.

896
01:07:46,415 --> 01:07:49,041
Very happy.

897
01:07:49,043 --> 01:07:51,626
Thank you.

898
01:07:51,628 --> 01:07:53,628
And, of course, to, uh..

899
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:57,257
To little,
uh, uh, Zachary.

900
01:07:57,259 --> 01:08:00,095
Um, who's also here.

901
01:08:02,514 --> 01:08:05,849
To Michael and..

902
01:08:05,851 --> 01:08:07,561
...to, um..

903
01:08:09,272 --> 01:08:11,230
...this..

904
01:08:11,232 --> 01:08:13,398
...special..

905
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,194
...thing that's happening
right before our eyes.

906
01:08:17,196 --> 01:08:19,654
Even though..

907
01:08:19,656 --> 01:08:22,283
...we're desperately trying
not to notice, it is.

908
01:08:22,285 --> 01:08:25,869
And I think it's right
that we celebrate that.

909
01:08:25,871 --> 01:08:29,748
So, to Michael and mom.

910
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,042
Cheers.

911
01:08:31,044 --> 01:08:32,042
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

912
01:08:32,044 --> 01:08:33,378
Hear, hear.

913
01:08:40,969 --> 01:08:42,931
You wanna say something,
Michael?

914
01:08:45,557 --> 01:08:46,640
You don't have
to say anything.

915
01:08:46,642 --> 01:08:49,018
I think you're
doing great.

916
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:50,271
Thank you.

917
01:08:51,438 --> 01:08:53,396
Nothing?

918
01:08:53,398 --> 01:08:56,567
- Would you like me to?
- Yeah.

919
01:08:56,569 --> 01:08:59,403
Sure. Uh..

920
01:08:59,405 --> 01:09:02,364
This has gotta be
really hard.

921
01:09:02,366 --> 01:09:04,699
Ah..

922
01:09:04,701 --> 01:09:08,162
I thank you for
welcoming me here.

923
01:09:08,164 --> 01:09:11,207
Uh, however you have.

924
01:09:11,209 --> 01:09:14,585
It can't have been easy.
I understand that.

925
01:09:14,587 --> 01:09:17,505
And it had to call on
some reserves.

926
01:09:17,507 --> 01:09:19,631
And I had
a great dinner.

927
01:09:19,633 --> 01:09:22,260
And you were very nice
to my guy.

928
01:09:22,262 --> 01:09:24,845
So, thank you.

929
01:09:24,847 --> 01:09:26,223
Hear, hear.

930
01:09:28,226 --> 01:09:30,768
To Michael.

931
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:32,603
- To Michael.
- To Michael.

932
01:09:32,605 --> 01:09:34,898
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

933
01:09:40,571 --> 01:09:43,448
It's hard to know,
you know, what to..

934
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:46,119
It's right to ce...
to celebrate it in..

935
01:09:47,911 --> 01:09:50,203
...some fucking way,
but it's..

936
01:09:50,205 --> 01:09:52,747
I don't know what to say.

937
01:09:52,749 --> 01:09:55,626
- You did great.
- Thank you.

938
01:09:55,628 --> 01:09:57,545
It's not like
there's, uh..

939
01:09:57,547 --> 01:10:00,965
It's not like
there's a card for..

940
01:10:00,967 --> 01:10:04,426
...good luck with your
new relationship

941
01:10:04,428 --> 01:10:06,054
older people.

942
01:10:12,312 --> 01:10:14,063
That's enough, Nicholas.

943
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:23,613
It's hard to know, isn't it?
It's hard to know what to say.

944
01:10:23,615 --> 01:10:25,032
Stop!

945
01:10:40,839 --> 01:10:42,342
Thank you.

946
01:11:04,905 --> 01:11:07,908
Zach, uh,
you wanna help me clear?

947
01:11:29,556 --> 01:11:31,850
- You're so selfish.
- Nick.

948
01:11:35,727 --> 01:11:37,060
- You're so self...
- Nick!

949
01:11:37,062 --> 01:11:38,895
Shut up.

950
01:11:38,897 --> 01:11:40,857
Where are you..
Wait. Wait!

951
01:11:40,859 --> 01:11:43,359
- Let her go! Nick.
- You should've asked.

952
01:11:43,361 --> 01:11:45,278
- You should've asked!
- Don't do that to her!

953
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,155
- Dick!
- You should have asked!

954
01:11:48,157 --> 01:11:50,323
- Ah!
- Nicholas! Nicholas, no!

955
01:11:50,325 --> 01:11:52,326
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come on!

956
01:11:52,328 --> 01:11:54,287
Nicholas! Ugh!

957
01:11:54,289 --> 01:11:56,079
- Come on! Come on!
- Get off him, Nick!

958
01:11:56,081 --> 01:11:57,331
- Get off him!
- Goddamn it!

959
01:11:57,333 --> 01:11:58,793
Oh!

960
01:12:01,504 --> 01:12:02,797
Jackass.

961
01:12:56,476 --> 01:13:00,478
And, um, he comes along
and he..

962
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,145
...he's got his
own tricks.

963
01:13:02,147 --> 01:13:04,482
He's got a few of his
own tricks up his sleeve.

964
01:13:04,484 --> 01:13:07,777
I mean,
he can walk on water.

965
01:13:07,779 --> 01:13:10,363
He can turn water
into wine.

966
01:13:10,365 --> 01:13:11,863
Ain't he? Uh, you get
what I'm saying?

967
01:13:11,865 --> 01:13:13,282
I think everything he did

968
01:13:13,284 --> 01:13:16,284
was kind of a step down
from the old man.

969
01:13:16,286 --> 01:13:18,537
Like..

970
01:13:18,539 --> 01:13:19,997
...water into wine?

971
01:13:19,999 --> 01:13:21,916
Congratulations,
that's a great trick.

972
01:13:21,918 --> 01:13:25,627
Um... you... he, your dad
made both of those

973
01:13:25,629 --> 01:13:27,380
out of hydrogen
and oxygen

974
01:13:27,382 --> 01:13:30,507
which he also made..

975
01:13:30,509 --> 01:13:32,342
...out of shit
that he made

976
01:13:32,344 --> 01:13:33,594
out of shit that he made

977
01:13:33,596 --> 01:13:35,680
that we don't
even know about yet.

978
01:13:35,682 --> 01:13:38,850
Um, okay,
so Jesus multiplied

979
01:13:38,852 --> 01:13:41,435
a bunch of bread
and fishes.

980
01:13:41,437 --> 01:13:44,315
Like, that's a great trick
if your dad is David Blaine.

981
01:13:45,691 --> 01:13:49,068
But, um..

982
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:50,610
...that ain't shit
when we're talking about

983
01:13:50,612 --> 01:13:54,364
wormholes, and antimatter.

984
01:13:54,366 --> 01:13:56,492
That's like,
that's some

985
01:13:56,494 --> 01:13:58,243
Frank Sinatra, Jr. shit
right there

986
01:13:58,245 --> 01:13:59,537
is what I call that.

987
01:13:59,539 --> 01:14:00,704
That's not even..

988
01:14:00,706 --> 01:14:02,873
That's not even
Julian Lennon.

989
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:06,543
That's like a Sean Lennon
body of work.

990
01:14:06,545 --> 01:14:08,296
"Hey, Dad."
"What?"

991
01:14:08,298 --> 01:14:11,549
"Um, uh,
I make cabinets."

992
01:14:11,551 --> 01:14:15,051
"I want..
You want an armoire?"

993
01:14:15,053 --> 01:14:17,181
"I created light."

994
01:14:18,432 --> 01:14:21,350
"Back off, moron."

995
01:14:21,352 --> 01:14:23,394
I don't know, I just feel,
I lost my dad

996
01:14:23,396 --> 01:14:24,729
so I feel a little..

997
01:14:24,731 --> 01:14:27,064
It's hard
to live up to him.

998
01:14:27,066 --> 01:14:29,734
Maybe that's coloring
my thoughts right now.

999
01:14:29,736 --> 01:14:32,903
Uh, apple falls far
from the tree sometimes.

1000
01:14:32,905 --> 01:14:37,158
I did, um, I did,
I just lost my dad.

1001
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,909
Uh, my father
passed away.

1002
01:14:38,911 --> 01:14:41,578
That's something that Jesus
never had to deal with.

1003
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:45,500
One of the perks
of dying at 33.

1004
01:14:45,502 --> 01:14:48,920
When your dad's
immortal anyway, like..

1005
01:14:48,922 --> 01:14:51,588
He didn't have
to go through this.

1006
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:53,757
Or like,
sell a house ever.

1007
01:14:53,759 --> 01:14:55,386
Jesus never had
to do that.

1008
01:14:57,137 --> 01:15:00,348
And I feel like,
oh, if my dad just died

1009
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,100
I'm starting to worry about
myself 'cause I've heard

1010
01:15:02,102 --> 01:15:04,354
that kind of thing runs
in the family, you know?

1011
01:15:06,271 --> 01:15:08,355
Anybody else
lose anybody recently?

1012
01:15:08,357 --> 01:15:10,524
Yeah, it sucks.
My dad, gone.

1013
01:15:10,526 --> 01:15:12,818
Just like,
that whole stick figure

1014
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:16,322
just wiped off
the back of my minivan.

1015
01:15:16,324 --> 01:15:18,198
That must be a sad job

1016
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,119
down at the gas station.

1017
01:15:23,164 --> 01:15:26,332
That takes an auto detailer
with a certain finesse

1018
01:15:26,334 --> 01:15:29,042
to be able to, like,
scrape the family member

1019
01:15:29,044 --> 01:15:30,672
off the back of the..

1020
01:15:33,465 --> 01:15:35,341
...van.

1021
01:15:35,343 --> 01:15:37,676
Um, but you know,
it's tough.

1022
01:15:37,678 --> 01:15:39,595
It's tough when you go
through losing a loved one.

1023
01:15:39,597 --> 01:15:40,971
Someone you grew up with

1024
01:15:40,973 --> 01:15:44,183
someone you admire
or hate or..

1025
01:15:44,185 --> 01:15:47,144
...hatemire.

1026
01:15:47,146 --> 01:15:49,146
Um, and then, like,
you... you

1027
01:15:49,148 --> 01:15:51,232
you put them away
forever.

1028
01:15:51,234 --> 01:15:55,110
Put 'em away? What? I don't think
that's the right terminology.

1029
01:15:55,112 --> 01:15:56,280
Yep.

1030
01:15:58,825 --> 01:16:00,118
Put that away.

1031
01:16:01,703 --> 01:16:03,243
That's the wo..
I don't underst..

1032
01:16:03,245 --> 01:16:08,498
When you have the ashes,
what are we saving them for?

1033
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,917
Uh, it's a bit like,
it's a ho..

1034
01:16:09,919 --> 01:16:11,627
It's like, when you save
ornaments for Christmas

1035
01:16:11,629 --> 01:16:13,753
but it's not every year.

1036
01:16:13,755 --> 01:16:16,882
Every 50 years,
they, they get up

1037
01:16:16,884 --> 01:16:19,801
and dance like
Tinker Bell.

1038
01:16:19,803 --> 01:16:21,470
I don't understand
why we save the ashes.

1039
01:16:21,472 --> 01:16:25,224
I couldn't convince 'em
to get rid of 'em.

1040
01:16:25,226 --> 01:16:28,019
Um, but you know..

1041
01:16:28,021 --> 01:16:30,438
...you lose somebody and then
you're like, "Well, what next?"

1042
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,357
And you've, we've all
lost somebody or..

1043
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:34,734
If you haven't,
then you're gonna lose

1044
01:16:34,736 --> 01:16:37,113
a whole lot all at once,
I guess.

1045
01:16:38,865 --> 01:16:40,366
Sorry.

1046
01:16:41,825 --> 01:16:45,286
Um, but then you're like,
"Oh, okay.

1047
01:16:45,288 --> 01:16:47,704
"This is sad, this is
very sad primarily.

1048
01:16:47,706 --> 01:16:49,207
And then what?
What's next?"

1049
01:16:49,209 --> 01:16:52,877
And... nothing.
Nothing happens.

1050
01:16:52,879 --> 01:16:55,337
Everybody, like, wipes their
hands and they're like..

1051
01:16:55,339 --> 01:16:58,882
"Great. You good?" "Um, I guess.
Yeah, I guess I'm good."

1052
01:16:58,884 --> 01:17:01,885
"I'm hungry primarily."
"Yeah, let's go eat."

1053
01:17:01,887 --> 01:17:04,221
And then, well, we got
a large group of people.

1054
01:17:04,223 --> 01:17:07,600
"Uh, Olive Garden." And, so
you end up at Olive Garden.

1055
01:17:07,602 --> 01:17:09,601
My dad was dead
for like 12 minutes

1056
01:17:09,603 --> 01:17:11,520
and we were diving
face-first

1057
01:17:11,522 --> 01:17:13,357
into pans of lasagna.

1058
01:17:15,151 --> 01:17:17,109
Okay.

1059
01:17:17,111 --> 01:17:19,194
I feel like
I'm at a..

1060
01:17:19,196 --> 01:17:22,198
I feel like
I'm at a funeral here.

1061
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,117
But I guess
I'm trying to say

1062
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:26,161
as shitty as death is..

1063
01:17:29,081 --> 01:17:31,623
...it's almost worse

1064
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:34,918
how easy it is to get
over somebody dying.

1065
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:39,340
Like, you expect
that when you die

1066
01:17:39,342 --> 01:17:40,675
everyone
in the whole world

1067
01:17:40,677 --> 01:17:42,510
is gonna be consumed
with grief.

1068
01:17:42,512 --> 01:17:44,595
Like, they're gonna thr..

1069
01:17:44,597 --> 01:17:47,305
Like CNN is gonna,
like, weep

1070
01:17:47,307 --> 01:17:50,600
and they're gonna throw
themselves on a funeral pyre

1071
01:17:50,602 --> 01:17:53,563
which they brought back
into fashion for you.

1072
01:17:53,565 --> 01:17:54,896
And none of that happens.

1073
01:17:54,898 --> 01:17:57,315
Everybody at the funeral
is drunk that night

1074
01:17:57,317 --> 01:18:01,112
and they're back to work at
most, like, later that week.

1075
01:18:01,114 --> 01:18:03,780
"Your loss." And then
they're just at work.

1076
01:18:03,782 --> 01:18:07,284
It's just an excuse to be 10
minutes late to work for a month.

1077
01:18:07,286 --> 01:18:10,121
"My dad died. Yeah.

1078
01:18:10,123 --> 01:18:12,290
"Yeah, it's tough.
My dad died.

1079
01:18:12,292 --> 01:18:15,128
I'll, I'll get right
on that, I promise."

1080
01:18:17,254 --> 01:18:19,171
- Hi. You all set?
- Hi.

1081
01:18:19,173 --> 01:18:22,466
You guys are great.
You guys are great.

1082
01:18:22,468 --> 01:18:24,760
I feel comfortable talking
about death with you guys

1083
01:18:24,762 --> 01:18:28,139
'cause it feels like I'm halfway
in the grave right now with you.

1084
01:18:28,141 --> 01:18:29,140
Wake up, dumb-dumb.

1085
01:18:29,142 --> 01:18:30,558
Um..

1086
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,560
I'm almost done.
We all are.

1087
01:18:32,562 --> 01:18:34,979
Just a few more decades
at most.

1088
01:18:34,981 --> 01:18:35,982
Oh, no,
don't do that.

1089
01:18:40,027 --> 01:18:42,444
Every funeral is basically the same.
We're not that special.

1090
01:18:42,446 --> 01:18:44,029
Whatever, whoever
the fuck you were

1091
01:18:44,031 --> 01:18:46,407
they have, they have, like,
a script they read from.

1092
01:18:46,409 --> 01:18:48,576
"He was a loving father."

1093
01:18:48,578 --> 01:18:50,661
It's all cliches.
Every funeral.

1094
01:18:50,663 --> 01:18:52,872
"He was a loving father,
he's in a better place."

1095
01:18:52,874 --> 01:18:56,626
"She's in peace now."
Have an original thought!

1096
01:18:56,628 --> 01:18:59,878
Why are these cliches? What
are you, Jon Bon Jovi?

1097
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,922
Get into some
deep shit for me.

1098
01:19:01,924 --> 01:19:04,341
"I wonder if he was
still alive

1099
01:19:04,343 --> 01:19:06,804
after he died
for a minute?"

1100
01:19:10,808 --> 01:19:12,558
Say that
at the gravesite.

1101
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:16,520
That's what the kids
are thinking.

1102
01:19:16,522 --> 01:19:20,360
I won... I wonder if like,
his kneecap's still alive.

1103
01:19:32,789 --> 01:19:34,249
He's coming up.

1104
01:19:37,127 --> 01:19:38,210
You there?

1105
01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:04,446
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1106
01:20:20,335 --> 01:20:21,588
What do you think
of this?

1107
01:20:23,464 --> 01:20:25,048
- Your shirt?
- Uh-huh.

1108
01:20:25,924 --> 01:20:27,550
I like it.

1109
01:20:27,552 --> 01:20:28,634
I've been buying these.

1110
01:20:29,678 --> 01:20:31,429
I thought I liked the cut.

1111
01:20:31,431 --> 01:20:32,430
It feels so bright now.

1112
01:20:32,432 --> 01:20:33,767
No, it fits well.

1113
01:20:34,433 --> 01:20:35,433
Thank you.

1114
01:20:44,067 --> 01:20:45,650
- You didn't read it?
- No.

1115
01:20:49,072 --> 01:20:50,657
I'll read it
when I want to.

1116
01:20:52,326 --> 01:20:54,788
I'm not gonna sit here
in front of you.

1117
01:20:58,290 --> 01:20:59,750
What are you getting?

1118
01:21:00,459 --> 01:21:02,083
Uh, maybe a soup.

1119
01:21:02,085 --> 01:21:03,504
Are you gonna eat?

1120
01:21:05,507 --> 01:21:06,840
Can't decide.

1121
01:21:21,021 --> 01:21:22,981
So I've been staying
with Chris.

1122
01:21:24,566 --> 01:21:25,819
He told me.

1123
01:21:27,152 --> 01:21:28,237
Right.

1124
01:22:16,619 --> 01:22:17,868
What are you thinkin'?

1125
01:22:17,870 --> 01:22:18,996
Nicholas.

1126
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,337
Becca, what?

1127
01:22:30,883 --> 01:22:32,051
Nicholas..

1128
01:22:37,932 --> 01:22:39,726
Let's not do this.

1129
01:22:54,574 --> 01:22:55,657
Thank you.

1130
01:23:19,723 --> 01:23:22,265
- Have you seen Nick?
- He went downstairs.

1131
01:23:22,267 --> 01:23:24,268
Well, he's got my shoes.

1132
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:26,979
Um, do you know
if he's all dressed?

1133
01:23:26,981 --> 01:23:29,023
He had a problem
with his key.

1134
01:23:29,025 --> 01:23:31,192
- So he's gonna come back here?
- Chris.

1135
01:23:31,194 --> 01:23:32,609
What? My shoes
are in his room.

1136
01:23:32,611 --> 01:23:34,112
Would you want me to not
wear shoes all day?

1137
01:23:34,114 --> 01:23:36,238
I want you to take care
of your own sorry self.

1138
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,616
I'm trying to,
but I'm wearing socks.

1139
01:24:22,035 --> 01:24:23,702
Oh, hey!

1140
01:24:23,704 --> 01:24:24,828
You know,
that was beautiful.

1141
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:26,583
Thank you.
Good to see you.

1142
01:24:27,542 --> 01:24:29,000
Hey, they're still warm.

1143
01:24:29,002 --> 01:24:31,004
- Right over there.
- Hey, you made it.

1144
01:24:33,505 --> 01:24:35,840
- Hello.
- Oh, hey, Paul.

1145
01:25:08,624 --> 01:25:09,791
She said..

1146
01:25:14,379 --> 01:25:15,505
That means I'm taller.

1147
01:25:15,507 --> 01:25:16,881
Yeah!

1148
01:25:16,883 --> 01:25:18,341
Claire wants
to say goodbye.

1149
01:25:18,343 --> 01:25:19,341
- Come help me with the table.
- Okay.

1150
01:25:19,343 --> 01:25:21,676
I'll be out
in five minutes.

1151
01:25:21,678 --> 01:25:22,763
I will!

1152
01:25:23,472 --> 01:25:24,555
Is it nice?

1153
01:25:24,557 --> 01:25:26,431
- It's fucking genius.
- So nice!

1154
01:25:26,433 --> 01:25:28,518
I haven't used it yet.

1155
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:31,394
You know, uh, Chris
doesn't like your place.

1156
01:25:31,396 --> 01:25:32,896
Yeah, that's what I said.

1157
01:25:32,898 --> 01:25:34,398
- That's exactly what I said.
- That's what he said.

1158
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,900
I was like, "I don't
like mom's new place."

1159
01:25:36,902 --> 01:25:39,069
What do you mean,
you don't like it?

1160
01:25:39,071 --> 01:25:40,238
I didn't say anything

1161
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,572
and that got construed as

1162
01:25:41,574 --> 01:25:44,283
"Chris hates
mom's new place."

1163
01:25:44,285 --> 01:25:45,408
Chris, what are
you wearing?

1164
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:46,952
Are you naked?

1165
01:25:46,954 --> 01:25:47,953
I didn't wear
any underwear.

1166
01:25:47,955 --> 01:25:49,788
To your grandmother's
funeral?

1167
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:51,040
- Chris..
- Oh, my..

1168
01:25:51,042 --> 01:25:52,917
What do you want from me?

1169
01:25:52,919 --> 01:25:54,961
Underwear.

1170
01:25:54,963 --> 01:25:56,753
It doesn't
affect you, man.

1171
01:25:56,755 --> 01:25:58,381
Nick, will you help me
with the table?

1172
01:25:58,383 --> 01:26:00,802
Just... stay a minute.

1173
01:26:03,972 --> 01:26:05,512
Whoo! Mm!

1174
01:26:05,514 --> 01:26:06,680
Yeah, give it a sit.

1175
01:26:06,682 --> 01:26:08,933
Nice.

1176
01:26:08,935 --> 01:26:10,600
- Right?
- Yeah.

1177
01:26:10,602 --> 01:26:13,311
Chris, would you just
cover yourself?

1178
01:26:13,313 --> 01:26:16,357
Why?
I am totally beautiful.

1179
01:26:18,986 --> 01:26:20,864
- Come on, Nick.
- Okay.

1180
01:26:33,668 --> 01:26:35,128
