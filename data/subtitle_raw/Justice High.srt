1
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,235
Yang Chae-young... Yang Chae-young!

2
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:33,402
Yang Chae-young... Yang Chae-young!

3
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:38,235
Yang Chae-young... Yang Chae-young!

4
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:45,110
What a know-it-all! Serves you right!

5
00:00:47,735 --> 00:00:48,985
Who said that?

6
00:00:50,235 --> 00:00:52,235
You insolent punks.

7
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:53,902
Back to your seats!

8
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:58,568
Don't just stand here like that.

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,485
Let's go.

10
00:01:14,443 --> 00:01:16,818
Yo, Yang Chae-young.

11
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:19,693
Happy that you're switching schools?

12
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:24,235
Don't you go around saying crap about me.

13
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:25,652
Watch out when you're out at night...

14
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:28,902
Hell... you startled me.

15
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:31,652
I'm all right.

16
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:33,985
You promised not to hit me again.

17
00:01:35,068 --> 00:01:38,443
Don't breathe a word about the fight we had.

18
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:40,402
Seriously.

19
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:47,152
Keep your promise!

20
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,193
<i>Justice High</i>

21
00:02:04,277 --> 00:02:09,068
<i>Justice High</i>

22
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:14,068
I'm here.

23
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,652
It's quiet here, isn't it?

24
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:23,068
It's our exam week.

25
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:25,610
Hey, pass it...

26
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:29,068
Shoot! Scores!

27
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:36,860
Chae-young took the midterms last week, right?

28
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:38,568
Yes.

29
00:02:38,652 --> 00:02:40,943
Since it's our exam week this week

30
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,860
she can join us starting next week.

31
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:44,443
Yes, ma'am.

32
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:47,402
Please look after Chae-young.

33
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:51,068
We had an episode of school violence recently.

34
00:02:51,152 --> 00:02:52,277
It's a bit chaotic around

35
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,735
and everyone is still a little wound up.

36
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:56,610
We had a big fight here last week

37
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:59,235
that ended with a student being suspended.

38
00:03:01,277 --> 00:03:04,068
Mr Yang, please look after Chae-young.

39
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:07,068
Of course, well...

40
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,277
There were some bullies

41
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,277
who kept picking on her.

42
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:15,610
She should've ignored them...

43
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:18,193
They just got into a bit of an argument.

44
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:19,985
Nothing to worry about, ma'am.

45
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:22,902
You didn't have to explain everything.

46
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:26,027
What? Did I say you were in the wrong?

47
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,860
I never said that, did I?

48
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:32,193
Think about it. This school has bullies too.

49
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:34,360
Rather than confronting them

50
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:37,902
you can always choose to ignore them.

51
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,318
You mean I should just ignore them?

52
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:40,985
- No, I mean...
- Dad.

53
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:42,277
If you let them get away with it once

54
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,693
you're giving them permission

55
00:03:43,777 --> 00:03:45,152
to run roughshod over you.

56
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:48,777
When adults ignore bullies

57
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,110
they are indirectly enabling them.

58
00:03:51,193 --> 00:03:54,693
I swear if you get into one more fight, I'll...

59
00:03:58,485 --> 00:03:59,860
- Not again?
- Chae-young..

60
00:03:59,943 --> 00:04:02,027
Nature calls.

61
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,402
But you just went earlier.

62
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:04,985
Take a walk. Just five minutes.

63
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:07,402
We both know you'll take half an hour!

64
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,152
- I'm going shopping!
- Sure, go ahead.

65
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:16,610
Repeat yourself. What did you just say?

66
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,402
If I help you to cheat

67
00:04:18,485 --> 00:04:20,943
it'll affect everyone else's grades.

68
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:22,943
That's not fair to them.

69
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:25,277
What? "Not fair"?

70
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:28,610
Hell, who says that anymore?

71
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:32,402
You're a real retard, aren't you?

72
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:36,027
- You... moron!
- Hey.

73
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,860
Move aside.

74
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:39,818
Come here.

75
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:41,360
I said, come here.

76
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:46,485
Jong-gu, we were asking you nicely.

77
00:04:46,568 --> 00:04:47,610
How dare you turn us down flat.

78
00:04:48,193 --> 00:04:49,652
You friggin' twerp.

79
00:04:49,777 --> 00:04:51,443
You sound like some old fart.

80
00:04:54,402 --> 00:04:57,610
"You must be fair to everyone taking the exam."

81
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:03,943
Bloody hell! You're asking for trouble!

82
00:05:04,027 --> 00:05:08,652
Hell... don't you think I know it?

83
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:11,360
What was this?

84
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:14,027
But what about the other students?

85
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,110
What the hell are you saying?

86
00:05:16,193 --> 00:05:17,943
Hey, what? Speak up.

87
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:21,318
It's not fair to those who studied hard!

88
00:05:21,402 --> 00:05:23,485
Bloody hell. He startled me.

89
00:05:23,568 --> 00:05:25,610
My ears are buzzing. What should I do?

90
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:28,568
You friggin' scumbag!

91
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:32,360
My, aren't you honest?

92
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:35,027
We have a Mr Prim And Proper here.

93
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:38,527
Friggin' retard! Bloody rat!

94
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,318
Moron! Retard! Idiot!

95
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:42,652
Stop hitting his head.

96
00:05:42,735 --> 00:05:44,943
What if he dies on us?

97
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:47,110
Hell... he makes my blood boil.

98
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:48,860
He's trembling like a leaf.

99
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:50,527
Did he pee his pants?

100
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:52,235
Crazy witch.

101
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,152
Pull his pants down and check for yourself.

102
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:55,652
Don't be ridiculous.

103
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,693
- That's enough.
- Are you in love with him?

104
00:06:02,152 --> 00:06:04,110
He looks pathetic enough as it is.

105
00:06:04,193 --> 00:06:06,652
What is this? Four ganging up on one.

106
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:10,985
My... is this a scene out of a friggin' movie?

107
00:06:11,318 --> 00:06:15,485
Hey... is she your wife?

108
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,110
She's taking a video.

109
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:20,902
Who are you?

110
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,652
Hand over that phone right now.

111
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:24,568
Hey, get up.

112
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,985
She ignored me.

113
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:29,443
Hey! Hand it over, you witch.

114
00:06:30,818 --> 00:06:33,818
Are you deaf? Get up now.

115
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:35,693
Are you friggin' nuts?

116
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:37,777
Don't you hear what we said?

117
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,693
Why? Want me to add a flush to those cheeks?

118
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:46,818
Being cocky gets you dead, you retard!

119
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:51,902
Let go of me!

120
00:06:51,985 --> 00:06:53,568
Don't frown.

121
00:06:53,652 --> 00:06:56,402
If you get wrinkles, it's game over for you.

122
00:06:57,277 --> 00:06:58,527
You witch!

123
00:07:03,402 --> 00:07:05,318
Hey, move aside.

124
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:07,818
You sure you want to do this?

125
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:16,235
M-My weiner... hell...

126
00:07:16,318 --> 00:07:17,360
You friggin' witch!

127
00:07:18,235 --> 00:07:19,485
Get over here!

128
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,235
You bloody witch!

129
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:34,818
Behind...

130
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:58,235
Be quiet!

131
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,527
You guys tanked the exam. So pipe down.

132
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,985
Sit down, now.

133
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,985
Hey, Yang Jeong-hak!

134
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,318
Yes.

135
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,235
We have a new student.

136
00:08:11,318 --> 00:08:13,943
Chae-young, introduce yourself.

137
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:18,027
Hello. I'm Yang Chae-young.

138
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:24,943
Let's be friends.

139
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,860
Be nice to her

140
00:08:27,943 --> 00:08:30,027
and help her settle in.

141
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,818
- You hear me?
- Yes.

142
00:08:32,902 --> 00:08:36,068
Chae-young, you can have that empty seat.

143
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,193
Class President, what's for first period?

144
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:43,443
- Science.
- OK, good.

145
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:53,402
So you're the new kid in my class?

146
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,027
Want to go to the cafeteria? I'm buying.

147
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,027
There's a cafeteria on the first...

148
00:09:10,152 --> 00:09:11,652
Yang Chae-young, wait up.

149
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:18,360
Hey, come here for a second.

150
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,568
Come over. Now.

151
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:24,027
Why?

152
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,068
- Come closer.
- Closer?

153
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:33,235
Pretend you don't know me.

154
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:41,610
I just wanted to thank you for yesterday...

155
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:43,818
That won't be necessary.

156
00:09:43,902 --> 00:09:45,235
You piqued my interest

157
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,652
with what you said about fairness.

158
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:48,360
That's why I stuck my nose in.

159
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,777
If you really want to thank me

160
00:09:51,735 --> 00:09:53,985
just stay away from me, OK?

161
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:02,443
My company abandoned me.

162
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,652
My wife abandoned me too.

163
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,527
Sir, it's closing time.

164
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:16,568
This bar is abandoning me too.

165
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:19,610
It's only 10.00pm!

166
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:21,610
What kind of a bar closes so early?

167
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:24,318
Hey, let's go...

168
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:26,193
Let's not come back here.

169
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:28,068
Let's go. Come on.

170
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:29,693
We're not coming back here.

171
00:10:30,777 --> 00:10:34,193
Let go. I have something I need to say.

172
00:10:34,277 --> 00:10:38,860
Your food is terrible. I'm...

173
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:41,485
not paying for it

174
00:10:42,193 --> 00:10:46,235
- Let's go.
- You should pay for what you ate.

175
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:47,485
Lady!

176
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:49,652
- You should pay...
- Shut it!

177
00:10:49,735 --> 00:10:52,777
I'm not bloody paying for it.

178
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,485
- Sir, you should pay.
- Get your hand off me!

179
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,110
- What do you want?
- That's enough.

180
00:11:04,193 --> 00:11:05,527
What's this?

181
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:08,610
Hey, attention!

182
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:09,818
Attention.

183
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:11,818
- Attention!
- Jong-gu!

184
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:14,943
- Attention.
- Hey, stop it! Let's go.

185
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:16,943
You brat.

186
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:18,860
We shouldn't have come here.

187
00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:19,985
Let's go.

188
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:22,027
Hey! Newbie!

189
00:11:24,277 --> 00:11:25,360
Me?

190
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:26,777
"Me"?

191
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,110
You're a cocky one.

192
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:36,777
Don't you see this?

193
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:45,860
So you really are a crazy witch.

194
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,193
Did you hit my girls?

195
00:11:55,402 --> 00:11:58,402
I exchanged a few words with your minions.

196
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,818
My minions?

197
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:02,985
Are you tired of living, you friggin' witch?

198
00:12:04,777 --> 00:12:06,527
So bloody rude.

199
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,443
Just hand me your phone while I'm being nice.

200
00:12:11,527 --> 00:12:14,985
My phone? Why do you want my phone?

201
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,860
Isn't that a violation of privacy?

202
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,110
Show some respect, newbie.

203
00:12:30,277 --> 00:12:32,902
You aren't acting like a senior should.

204
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,610
That's why you're not getting any respect.

205
00:12:35,193 --> 00:12:36,235
What's this?

206
00:12:36,318 --> 00:12:38,402
Let go of me, you friggin' skank!

207
00:12:40,277 --> 00:12:41,943
Sae-na, are you OK?

208
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:46,193
So you don't know your place either.

209
00:12:46,277 --> 00:12:48,318
Birds of the same feather indeed.

210
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,193
Hey, pin her down.

211
00:12:55,902 --> 00:12:57,735
You still don't get it, do you?

212
00:12:59,068 --> 00:13:01,693
Want me to upload that video?

213
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:05,027
We're so sorry, Sae-na!

214
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,568
Morons. You're deadmeat!

215
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:17,318
You said you're a senior.

216
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,193
So I'll let you off this time.

217
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:53,110
Yang Chae-young.

218
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,902
Teach me how to fight.

219
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:01,652
I hate repeating myself.

220
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:03,443
Don't follow me.

221
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,902
My dad died when I was little.

222
00:14:11,277 --> 00:14:13,902
My mum runs a diner all by herself.

223
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:16,277
We get a lot of difficult customers at night.

224
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:18,610
Last night, one of the customers

225
00:14:18,693 --> 00:14:20,068
was giving us a hard time.

226
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,818
And there was nothing I could do about it.

227
00:14:26,443 --> 00:14:28,193
What has that got to do with me?

228
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:29,318
Just call the police.

229
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:32,277
Please teach me how to be strong like you.

230
00:14:33,777 --> 00:14:34,818
So you can fight back

231
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:36,277
and wind up at the police station?

232
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,860
Don't be stupid. Just call the police.

233
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:40,277
I don't want to hurt anyone.

234
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,985
I just want to protect my mum.

235
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,277
"Justice without power is hollow."

236
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,735
"But power without justice is merely violence."

237
00:14:52,277 --> 00:14:54,027
Master Choi Bae-dal said that.

238
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,027
Right, there's a biographical film of him.

239
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,985
Have you seen it? <i>Fighter In The Wind.</i>

240
00:14:58,402 --> 00:14:59,443
No.

241
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:01,943
Oh... I see.

242
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,818
Anyway, karate is not about

243
00:15:05,902 --> 00:15:07,777
hurting people, but protecting them...

244
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,568
- Dad.
- Yeah, Chae-young.

245
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:16,777
Is the dust giving you a sore throat?

246
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,318
Wear a mask.

247
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:19,735
Come on now.

248
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:21,277
The academy gives a GV

249
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,568
to anyone who brings in a new student.

250
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:23,777
A GV?

251
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:25,443
This?

252
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:27,527
Come on.

253
00:15:27,902 --> 00:15:31,277
Gift voucher. I brought him here.

254
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:35,818
Of course, I have it right here.

255
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:37,735
Here.

256
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:43,152
Not funny.

257
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:50,693
OK. Here you go. Take it.

258
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:55,277
You know you're really cheap, right?

259
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,610
What?

260
00:15:56,693 --> 00:15:58,277
I'm going out.

261
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,318
The bottom line is...

262
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:07,318
sign up now

263
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:08,443
and you'll get 50% discount

264
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:09,568
for the first month.

265
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,152
<i>Application Form</i>

266
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:22,860
<i>Jeongdokwan Kyokushin Korea Federation</i>

267
00:16:29,027 --> 00:16:30,152
Yang Chae-young.

268
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:34,985
What?

269
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:37,277
No, I mean...

270
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,777
If I do taekwondo, I'll be strong like you?

271
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,443
- This is karate, not taekwondo.
- Oh, karate.

272
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:44,943
Dad taught me how to kick

273
00:16:45,027 --> 00:16:46,443
as soon as I started walking.

274
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:50,693
If you want to be like me, give it a try.

275
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:53,777
Or whatever.

276
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,443
Hey there!

277
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:04,360
We'll start training tomorrow?

278
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:14,902
Jin-hyeok, since you became

279
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:16,777
the president of the student council

280
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:19,443
the atmosphere in school has gotten much better.

281
00:17:20,568 --> 00:17:21,735
Thank you, sir.

282
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:25,068
When Baek Gang-shik made trouble

283
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:28,818
you handled his victim well

284
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:30,818
and we managed to keep it within the school.

285
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:32,777
And it all went away quietly.

286
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,943
I didn't do much.

287
00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:38,985
It was just a fight between friends.

288
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,152
I hated seeing that happen.

289
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:43,527
By the way

290
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:47,152
the student council is doing a good job.

291
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:49,735
I feel reassured.

292
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,402
When Gang-shik is back from his suspension

293
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:53,152
please keep an eye on him.

294
00:17:53,235 --> 00:17:54,860
- OK?
- Sure.

295
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,610
Don't worry, sir. I'll talk to him.

296
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,693
I'll get your recommendation letter ready.

297
00:18:05,777 --> 00:18:07,777
Just maintain your school grades.

298
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:10,693
Sure.

299
00:18:12,485 --> 00:18:15,860
By the way, how is your father?

300
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:19,485
<i>Principal's Office</i>

301
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:25,235
What a pain. That bloody fogey.

302
00:18:28,902 --> 00:18:30,318
Joo Hae-seong!

303
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:31,693
How can you sleep now?

304
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,277
A new student walked all over me!

305
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:37,235
Sae-na, I can see under your skirt.

306
00:18:37,318 --> 00:18:38,402
Hell...

307
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,235
You pervert!

308
00:18:40,735 --> 00:18:44,610
Be more careful. You're practically flashing me.

309
00:18:45,318 --> 00:18:46,860
Hey, Lee Sae-na.

310
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:48,235
I heard all about yesterday.

311
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:50,110
You wound up on the floor.

312
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:52,110
I bet it was humiliating.

313
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:54,360
If I were you, I'd quit school.

314
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:56,568
Park Jin-hyeok, shut it.

315
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:58,110
You don't want to rile me.

316
00:18:58,193 --> 00:18:59,985
Oh, just relax.

317
00:19:01,068 --> 00:19:04,152
Hey! Aren't you going to do something about it?

318
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,568
Hey, a junior really did hit you?

319
00:19:08,152 --> 00:19:10,152
Of course, you dweeb.

320
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,818
How could you laugh about it?

321
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:16,860
The school's going to be turned upside-down.

322
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:18,610
What's with you today?

323
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:24,193
Who was it?

324
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:27,068
Who humiliated the mighty Lee Sae-na?

325
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:29,568
Keep that up and you're a dead man.

326
00:19:31,235 --> 00:19:32,735
All right, fine.

327
00:19:33,235 --> 00:19:34,693
- Jin-hyeok.
- Yeah?

328
00:19:34,777 --> 00:19:37,735
Let's meet that crazy newbie tomorrow.

329
00:19:37,818 --> 00:19:39,068
OK.

330
00:19:39,735 --> 00:19:42,068
Summon her here.

331
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:46,277
What?

332
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,402
She'll come if you summon her.

333
00:19:48,485 --> 00:19:50,360
You're the student president after all.

334
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,318
OK.

335
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:05,235
Come on, come up. A little more...

336
00:20:06,735 --> 00:20:08,277
Master...

337
00:20:08,902 --> 00:20:11,360
OK. Seven!

338
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,693
Come up now!

339
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:18,985
This is the best way to improve endurance.

340
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:23,027
Master, may I take a short break?

341
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:32,443
Is this really relevant to karate?

342
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,110
Of course, my dear student.

343
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,860
Your current fitness level

344
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:41,235
is a joke. OK?

345
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:43,235
- Just do what I say, please.
- But...

346
00:20:43,318 --> 00:20:44,485
I said a thousand times.

347
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:46,943
- You've only done 12.
- But...

348
00:20:47,027 --> 00:20:48,277
Ready, go!

349
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,860
Master, wait.

350
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,402
- You'd better do it at once.
- Master.

351
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,860
Wait a minute! Hold that position.

352
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:56,277
- Don't move.
- OK.

353
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:01,818
- Chae-young.
- What?

354
00:21:01,902 --> 00:21:04,318
- Help him with the splits.
- What?

355
00:21:05,068 --> 00:21:07,527
Let's get it done. Sit against the wall.

356
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,027
Sit down!

357
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,693
- Spread your legs.
- Wait.

358
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:14,735
This is killing me...

359
00:21:14,818 --> 00:21:16,777
If you fight this, your muscles will tear.

360
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,652
No, wait...

361
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,235
- Wait, no.
- Come on!

362
00:21:21,318 --> 00:21:23,485
Chae-young, wait!

363
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:25,777
Don't be a baby! We're just getting started!

364
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,152
But it really hurts...

365
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:29,568
Breathe through the pain. This won't kill you.

366
00:21:29,652 --> 00:21:31,568
OK? Relax.

367
00:21:31,652 --> 00:21:32,777
One, two, three!

368
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:35,485
How can you do this?

369
00:21:35,568 --> 00:21:37,360
It really hurts, Chae-young!

370
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:39,027
- Hey.
- What?

371
00:21:41,402 --> 00:21:43,735
When you can't avoid it, what do you do?

372
00:21:43,818 --> 00:21:45,068
You learn to enjoy it.

373
00:21:56,693 --> 00:21:57,943
Hey.

374
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,443
It'll hurt even more tomorrow.

375
00:22:02,193 --> 00:22:04,610
Hurry. We're late.

376
00:22:08,902 --> 00:22:10,235
Run!

377
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:15,485
Come on!

378
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:32,610
Y-Y-You're to go see the student council.

379
00:22:32,693 --> 00:22:33,860
Me?

380
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,152
Says who?

381
00:22:36,235 --> 00:22:38,235
The president of the student council.

382
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,735
And why are you the one telling me?

383
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:44,193
Why does the president want to see me?

384
00:22:45,193 --> 00:22:47,568
M-Maybe it's because you're a new student.

385
00:22:53,402 --> 00:22:54,902
Where's the student council office?

386
00:22:55,652 --> 00:22:56,860
This way!

387
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,235
This way, you dummy.

388
00:22:59,568 --> 00:23:02,277
Sorry, this way.

389
00:23:05,068 --> 00:23:06,485
Let her in.

390
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,152
Come in.

391
00:23:11,235 --> 00:23:13,110
Come in, it's OK.

392
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:15,527
- Come in.
- You wanted to see me?

393
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,860
Yeah.

394
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:21,943
Yang Chae-young.

395
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,527
I was wondering why you got transferred here.

396
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:26,277
You got into pretty serious trouble

397
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,777
at your old school.

398
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,402
What's this? You broke someone's arm?

399
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:32,902
Did you hit him when he was sleeping...

400
00:23:32,985 --> 00:23:34,110
What's this about?

401
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,360
You really have no manners, don't you?

402
00:23:39,943 --> 00:23:40,985
Right?

403
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:49,318
You're quiet today.

404
00:23:49,402 --> 00:23:51,777
Where's that sharp tongue of yours?

405
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,985
Why? Are you scared of these boys?

406
00:23:56,193 --> 00:23:57,902
Not so formidable after all, huh?

407
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:05,610
You don't know what you did wrong, do you?

408
00:24:05,693 --> 00:24:08,235
I'm your senior but you walked all over me.

409
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:09,777
My dear senior.

410
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,943
You swore at me, demanded I hand over my phone

411
00:24:14,027 --> 00:24:16,443
and hit me first when I did nothing.

412
00:24:16,527 --> 00:24:17,860
I hit you first?

413
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:21,735
You hit Ye-eun and So-yeon first.

414
00:24:22,068 --> 00:24:23,902
They hit my classmate first

415
00:24:23,985 --> 00:24:26,735
because he wouldn't help them cheat in an exam.

416
00:24:26,818 --> 00:24:29,777
Four of them ganged up on him.

417
00:24:30,193 --> 00:24:32,527
I just advised them not to do so.

418
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:35,818
So what did I do that was so wrong?

419
00:24:39,485 --> 00:24:40,735
Hey.

420
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:44,443
It wasn't nice to knock her down.

421
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:46,402
"Wasn't nice"?

422
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,318
Hey, do you friggin' mean that?

423
00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:50,693
Y-Yang Chae-young.

424
00:24:51,193 --> 00:24:53,277
Just apologise to her and go.

425
00:25:01,985 --> 00:25:06,110
I'm sorry for what happened yesterday.

426
00:25:08,402 --> 00:25:09,943
Can I go now?

427
00:25:10,402 --> 00:25:12,193
I haven't had lunch yet.

428
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,193
Lunch? Bloody hell.

429
00:25:14,277 --> 00:25:15,527
Are you kidding me?

430
00:25:16,485 --> 00:25:18,277
Then, I'm off.

431
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,693
Go.

432
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:23,777
Hey!

433
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,193
Who said you could go? Bloody...

434
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:27,985
I did.

435
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,568
Just go.

436
00:25:40,818 --> 00:25:43,610
Hey, you just let her walk out?

437
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:45,235
You're making me lose face.

438
00:25:46,318 --> 00:25:48,277
- Lose face?
- Yes.

439
00:25:48,735 --> 00:25:50,193
They ganged up on a student

440
00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:51,943
because he wouldn't help them cheat.

441
00:25:52,402 --> 00:25:55,652
You'll be losing face if you take their side.

442
00:25:56,735 --> 00:25:59,568
- What?
- Hell, this is embarrassing.

443
00:26:03,902 --> 00:26:05,152
Again?

444
00:26:06,068 --> 00:26:08,110
Athletes need protein

445
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:09,318
but all we get is black bean noodles.

446
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:10,735
What are you talking about?

447
00:26:10,818 --> 00:26:13,777
Here's your protein right here.

448
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,693
Eat up.

449
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,777
- Master.
- What?

450
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,318
I see you giving grade school kids a ride home.

451
00:26:24,402 --> 00:26:26,193
Do you have a lot of grade school kids here?

452
00:26:29,818 --> 00:26:31,110
Of course.

453
00:26:31,193 --> 00:26:33,902
We have so many young karate practitioners.

454
00:26:33,985 --> 00:26:35,235
Sure.

455
00:26:35,652 --> 00:26:37,068
Two. Just two.

456
00:26:39,777 --> 00:26:42,568
It doesn't matter how many, right?

457
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:44,652
Karate is an Olympic sport now.

458
00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:47,068
Sheesh. If our students were selected

459
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:50,360
for the national team, I can't even...

460
00:26:53,402 --> 00:26:54,568
But...

461
00:26:55,818 --> 00:26:59,818
there's something more important at hand.

462
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,610
Not again? We're eating!

463
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:05,443
Never mind that. Just eat.

464
00:27:05,527 --> 00:27:07,527
Your noodles is going to get soggy!

465
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,568
Got it. Be right back!

466
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:22,568
Why do you keep to yourself in school?

467
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:28,402
I mean, I'm an introvert

468
00:27:28,943 --> 00:27:30,777
and I'm lousy at fighting.

469
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,818
- But you...
- What about me?

470
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:37,693
You're so cool and pretty

471
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:40,193
and good at fighting too.

472
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,027
I think many kids would want you as a friend.

473
00:27:47,068 --> 00:27:48,110
It's too much of a bother.

474
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,693
Getting to know people and making friends.

475
00:27:53,777 --> 00:27:54,818
It's a hassle.

476
00:27:57,735 --> 00:27:59,485
Whoever it is you meet

477
00:27:59,568 --> 00:28:00,943
sooner or later, you have to say goodbye.

478
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:02,110
Right?

479
00:28:04,235 --> 00:28:05,652
So why bother?

480
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:10,360
So don't try to be my friend.

481
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,402
I'm always by myself...

482
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:21,319
when I go home after school.

483
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,444
I envy the other kids

484
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:28,152
who have friends to walk home with.

485
00:28:30,944 --> 00:28:33,985
They'll part ways eventually.

486
00:28:35,444 --> 00:28:36,860
But...

487
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:41,319
I still think it means something

488
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:43,402
even if you have to say goodbye later.

489
00:28:43,485 --> 00:28:46,027
"It was fun walking home together."

490
00:28:46,694 --> 00:28:49,069
"I'm glad we got to walk together."

491
00:28:49,152 --> 00:28:51,277
That's how I would think.

492
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:56,235
It's really lonely to walk home alone.

493
00:29:35,652 --> 00:29:37,610
I'm embarrassed for you.

494
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:41,777
You walk like you just got circumcised.

495
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,527
Don't come to the dojo today. Rest at home.

496
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,027
And put on some of this ointment.

497
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,694
No, I'm OK.

498
00:29:49,777 --> 00:29:51,485
I'll use the ointment and be at the dojo.

499
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:54,610
Your muscles need rest to heal.

500
00:29:54,944 --> 00:29:56,485
Listen to me.

501
00:30:05,402 --> 00:30:06,777
Thank you.

502
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,610
I'm not giving it to you, so bring it back.

503
00:30:13,985 --> 00:30:15,444
Is it tasty?

504
00:30:17,694 --> 00:30:19,569
Bozo.

505
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,652
Are you coming tomorrow?

506
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:23,527
Let's drink ourselves senseless.

507
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,777
I have no money, dude.

508
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,944
It's on me, bro.

509
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:29,694
Just thank me very much, OK?

510
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,027
How do you have so much money?

511
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,277
You don't get much allowance.

512
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,777
Come on.

513
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,027
I have money to spend

514
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,610
even if my dad doesn't give me any.

515
00:30:37,694 --> 00:30:39,485
I have my ways.

516
00:30:41,402 --> 00:30:42,610
What are you looking at?

517
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,152
That's the crazy witch.

518
00:30:48,235 --> 00:30:51,485
Bloody hell, she's no match for me.

519
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:53,569
And all that fuss.

520
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:57,860
I didn't notice it before but...

521
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,610
she's kind of cute, isn't she?

522
00:31:04,652 --> 00:31:06,360
Are you listening?

523
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:09,527
What did you say?

524
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:20,235
Hey, wait a minute.

525
00:31:20,944 --> 00:31:22,235
What about that?

526
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,402
- Get it together!
- Yes, sir.

527
00:31:25,485 --> 00:31:27,319
If you do good work...

528
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:33,610
- Happy?
- Sure.

529
00:31:33,694 --> 00:31:35,402
You like that?

530
00:31:35,485 --> 00:31:36,652
Sir.

531
00:31:36,735 --> 00:31:39,485
On that note, I'll start the party.

532
00:31:50,485 --> 00:31:51,735
Where are you?

533
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:54,069
Why are you calling me when you're already here?

534
00:31:54,444 --> 00:31:55,694
Come in!

535
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,569
He's here.

536
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:11,110
Turn it off.

537
00:32:11,402 --> 00:32:12,652
Turn it off.

538
00:32:13,194 --> 00:32:14,360
Turn it off!

539
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,360
Hey.

540
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:24,860
You know why we're here tonight?

541
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,152
To celebrate the return of Baek Gang-shik

542
00:32:27,235 --> 00:32:29,277
from Busan.

543
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,485
Yeah.

544
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:32,569
What's the big deal about hitting a guy?

545
00:32:32,652 --> 00:32:33,694
Now...

546
00:32:33,777 --> 00:32:36,152
let's drink to celebrate Gang-shik's return!

547
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:38,777
Cheers!

548
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,360
Bloody hell!

549
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,319
Drink!

550
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,152
You're not drinking?

551
00:32:46,694 --> 00:32:49,694
Is Sae-na still after Hae-seong?

552
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:51,610
Come to me.

553
00:32:51,694 --> 00:32:53,027
I'll treat you better than Hae-seong does.

554
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,569
You stupid?

555
00:32:55,444 --> 00:32:58,152
Sae-na only has eyes for Hae-seong.

556
00:32:58,485 --> 00:32:59,860
Right.

557
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:04,402
What?

558
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:06,235
Am I wrong?

559
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,610
Hey.

560
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,527
We used to fight

561
00:33:21,527 --> 00:33:23,819
only when someone picked on us.

562
00:33:24,735 --> 00:33:27,027
They'd hit us, and we'd hit back.

563
00:33:29,402 --> 00:33:31,652
That's how we used to do things.

564
00:33:34,194 --> 00:33:36,319
I don't understand what you're doing anymore.

565
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,235
I'm just playing a bigger game.

566
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:43,694
Stop bringing up the past.

567
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,860
Did you join a gang?

568
00:33:54,027 --> 00:33:56,527
I've talked about it with Kim Sang-jin.

569
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,277
I have money to pay the initiation fee.

570
00:34:01,402 --> 00:34:02,652
What?

571
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,360
Initiation fee?

572
00:34:05,235 --> 00:34:06,944
Hae-seong.

573
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,485
Let's play in the big league!

574
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,985
You're taking this way too far.

575
00:34:20,694 --> 00:34:22,360
Initiation fee?

576
00:34:22,985 --> 00:34:25,985
- What the hell...
- You twerp.

577
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:28,819
Why are you walking all over me these days?

578
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,569
Snap out of it, moron.

579
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:44,944
Don't do anything you'll regret.

580
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:48,610
If you talk about joining a gang ever again

581
00:34:50,277 --> 00:34:51,860
I'll kill you.

582
00:34:56,402 --> 00:34:58,194
Go to hell, you moron!

583
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:21,985
<i>If Dad were still alive</i>

584
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:24,694
<i>our lives wouldn't be this hard.</i>

585
00:35:24,777 --> 00:35:27,277
<i>Your dad did the right thing.</i>

586
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,194
<i>I'm proud of him.</i>

587
00:35:32,235 --> 00:35:33,527
<i>Does that even matter?</i>

588
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,069
<i>He's not with us now.</i>

589
00:36:20,152 --> 00:36:22,069
- I'm home...
- Gosh.

590
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,319
Oh, my pretty baby girl.

591
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:35,235
I said I don't want to see her pictures again.

592
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:39,735
Why are you so dumb? She left us.

593
00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:40,902
Why do you miss her?

594
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:42,569
Chae-young.

595
00:36:43,277 --> 00:36:45,985
You shouldn't say that about your mum.

596
00:36:46,652 --> 00:36:49,069
Your mum is not a bad person.

597
00:36:49,985 --> 00:36:51,777
She loves you very much.

598
00:36:54,985 --> 00:36:56,444
Maybe she does.

599
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,360
But...

600
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:03,319
she loves money even more.

601
00:37:03,985 --> 00:37:06,069
She's not to blame.

602
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,569
It was all my fault.

603
00:37:13,235 --> 00:37:14,902
She's not my mum.

604
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:18,444
You can come back to visit Dad when you want.

605
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:23,485
Don't be stubborn. Come with me.

606
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:26,360
You want me to abandon Dad like you're doing?

607
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,694
What did he ever do to deserve this?

608
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:30,610
What did he do?

609
00:37:32,027 --> 00:37:34,402
You know how crazy he is about karate.

610
00:37:35,235 --> 00:37:36,944
He spent all our money to open a dojo.

611
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:39,319
Now he's heavily in debt. You know that?

612
00:37:40,944 --> 00:37:43,152
You're really not coming with me?

613
00:37:44,235 --> 00:37:45,485
Just go, Mum.

614
00:37:47,694 --> 00:37:52,235
Just go and be with that rich guy.

615
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:54,944
I'll stay with Dad.

616
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,235
You're really your father's girl.

617
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:03,069
You two live together then.

618
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:11,235
Mum, don't go...

619
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:13,277
Mum...

620
00:38:26,444 --> 00:38:28,860
You should've let me know right away, bozo!

621
00:38:28,944 --> 00:38:30,694
Sorry, I didn't know

622
00:38:30,777 --> 00:38:31,902
he was already in the room.

623
00:38:31,985 --> 00:38:33,360
Hell.

624
00:38:45,485 --> 00:38:46,985
Hey, Sang-jin!

625
00:38:48,735 --> 00:38:50,527
Oh, Park Jin-hyeok.

626
00:38:51,152 --> 00:38:54,319
Hell, I'm liking your school.

627
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:57,735
Hot girls out there and a room of your own.

628
00:38:58,194 --> 00:38:59,235
Have you done it with a girl in here?

629
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:01,319
Why didn't you call me before coming here?

630
00:39:01,402 --> 00:39:03,485
I told you I'd stop by soon.

631
00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:07,569
Friggin' punk. Are you my boss now?

632
00:39:09,027 --> 00:39:10,860
That's not what I meant.

633
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:14,277
I was just messing with you.

634
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:17,777
Don't be such a wuss.

635
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:23,152
Hey, I hear you've been learning boxing.

636
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,819
How did you know?

637
00:39:25,277 --> 00:39:27,402
Min-seok from your gym told me.

638
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:30,402
He told me you pulled a dirty trick on him.

639
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:32,277
Oh... Min-seok?

640
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,360
We sparred twice and I kicked his butt.

641
00:39:34,444 --> 00:39:35,694
He didn't say squat to me.

642
00:39:36,235 --> 00:39:38,027
He's all talk.

643
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:41,235
It's no use talking only, right?

644
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:43,194
No doubt.

645
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,944
Are you Baek Gang-shik?

646
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,360
Hey. Say something in Busan dialect.

647
00:39:50,402 --> 00:39:51,985
Are you my boss now?

648
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:57,277
That was pretty good!

649
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,777
I love the way he speaks.

650
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,360
- Jin-hyeok.
- Yeah.

651
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,027
You told me you got this school covered.

652
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,194
But, bloody hell...

653
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,444
you should take your boys in hand.

654
00:40:16,402 --> 00:40:19,152
Is that the right attitude a lackey should have?

655
00:40:20,152 --> 00:40:22,944
Hey, you're a good fighter?

656
00:40:23,777 --> 00:40:24,819
Want to go outside with me?

657
00:40:25,485 --> 00:40:26,777
No.

658
00:40:27,152 --> 00:40:29,444
- I don't mean to...
- Hell, Jin-hyeok!

659
00:40:31,902 --> 00:40:33,069
You said you want to join us

660
00:40:33,152 --> 00:40:35,069
but didn't follow up.

661
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:37,110
Do you have the initiation fee ready?

662
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,777
Almost. I'll send it to you soon.

663
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,444
Time's running out.

664
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:46,235
I'll be starting my career once I graduate.

665
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,027
But you got nothing. Right?

666
00:40:49,902 --> 00:40:50,944
Right.

667
00:40:52,235 --> 00:40:54,235
What is Hae-seong doing these days?

668
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:57,027
We need that crazy guy.

669
00:40:58,194 --> 00:41:01,235
I can't believe you're the number one here.

670
00:41:01,819 --> 00:41:04,277
Hae-seong has never been number one.

671
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,735
I've been taking care of things here.

672
00:41:07,444 --> 00:41:09,694
It's been a while since I saw Hae-seong.

673
00:41:10,527 --> 00:41:11,860
Anyway...

674
00:41:12,985 --> 00:41:15,819
I'll have everything set up for you, all right?

675
00:41:16,444 --> 00:41:17,694
Just join us.

676
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,527
Hey, let's go.

677
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:27,819
I'll let it go this time on Jin-hyeok's account.

678
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,777
Glare at me one more time

679
00:41:32,277 --> 00:41:34,110
I'll gouge your eyes out.

680
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:37,735
It's so hard to see you, dude.

681
00:41:38,694 --> 00:41:40,402
Are you a celebrity or something?

682
00:41:40,694 --> 00:41:43,735
So, what brings you here?

683
00:41:43,819 --> 00:41:45,485
Are you still mad at me?

684
00:41:46,027 --> 00:41:49,819
It was so frigging long ago. Be a man.

685
00:41:49,902 --> 00:41:51,694
If you have nothing to say, I'm off.

686
00:41:53,735 --> 00:41:55,402
Join the gang.

687
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,444
I'll hook you up with my boss.

688
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,610
Who's your boss?

689
00:42:07,235 --> 00:42:09,444
Gangbuk was united the year before.

690
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,569
By my boss.

691
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,527
After he graduated

692
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,569
he completely reorganised the gangs.

693
00:42:19,777 --> 00:42:21,277
They're even getting paid now.

694
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,819
It's amazing how much money you can make.

695
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,819
You get a lot of money from the gambling tables.

696
00:42:26,902 --> 00:42:28,527
And, hell...

697
00:42:29,652 --> 00:42:31,360
there are no lack of horny old farts.

698
00:42:31,444 --> 00:42:32,735
You can hook them up with chicks...

699
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:34,735
Bloody hell, aren't you taking it too far?

700
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:37,819
There's no one who can do what you do.

701
00:42:39,235 --> 00:42:41,985
- Join us.
- Sang-jin...

702
00:42:42,902 --> 00:42:44,527
If you join the gang, you'll end up in jail.

703
00:42:45,777 --> 00:42:47,777
Let's not see each other again.

704
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,944
Your boss, Jin-hyeok...

705
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,860
He's joining us.

706
00:42:53,485 --> 00:42:56,444
So, see you around.

707
00:43:01,069 --> 00:43:03,777
You friggin' retard! Hey.

708
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,360
You still don't get the picture?

709
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,860
Still don't get the picture? Know your place.

710
00:43:10,944 --> 00:43:13,235
Don't you frigging drag me down!

711
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:16,319
Sorry.

712
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:20,569
Hey... I saved you from getting expelled.

713
00:43:20,652 --> 00:43:23,110
I cleaned up your mess!

714
00:43:26,027 --> 00:43:27,777
You better not forget that.

715
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,569
We must get the collections done soon.

716
00:43:34,652 --> 00:43:36,152
Let them in.

717
00:43:36,444 --> 00:43:37,694
Right...

718
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,860
Hey.

719
00:43:40,777 --> 00:43:42,735
Bring this bozo to me.

720
00:43:45,444 --> 00:43:47,652
He needs to be taught a lesson.

721
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:52,027
Jeong Jong-gu, you friggin' loser!

722
00:43:52,944 --> 00:43:53,985
What's up?

723
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:56,944
What's up with you lately, moron?

724
00:43:57,027 --> 00:43:59,152
Hell... what do you want?

725
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:00,444
"Hell"?

726
00:44:00,902 --> 00:44:04,069
He said "Hell". Can you believe it?

727
00:44:05,152 --> 00:44:06,694
You friggin' loser.

728
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,527
What the...

729
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,819
What the hell? Let go! What's this?

730
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:14,110
- One, two...
- Hell!

731
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,194
Hey, wait.

732
00:44:16,277 --> 00:44:17,985
Wait a minute...

733
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:21,944
You friggin' schmuck.

734
00:44:22,569 --> 00:44:23,819
Hey, wait...

735
00:44:24,902 --> 00:44:27,027
Hell! You bloody son-of-a-gun!

736
00:44:29,527 --> 00:44:31,152
Hell...

737
00:44:31,527 --> 00:44:33,569
Go to hell!

738
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,527
Bloody hell!

739
00:44:42,985 --> 00:44:44,194
Hell...

740
00:44:44,694 --> 00:44:47,902
Ouch! My arm's going to break!

741
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,360
Hell!

742
00:44:58,194 --> 00:44:59,652
What are you doing?

743
00:45:00,652 --> 00:45:02,944
Let go, you bozo!

744
00:45:03,027 --> 00:45:04,860
Bloody tosser.

745
00:45:04,944 --> 00:45:08,819
You're a dead man today! Loser!

746
00:45:08,902 --> 00:45:10,152
Yang Chae-young is not here.

747
00:45:10,235 --> 00:45:11,277
- Don't get cute.
- Come with us.

748
00:45:15,944 --> 00:45:18,235
You're a dead man, loser.

749
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,152
You're Chae-young's friend, aren't you?

750
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,819
Good afternoon.

751
00:45:22,902 --> 00:45:24,360
What are you doing?

752
00:45:25,027 --> 00:45:28,444
Jin-hyeok wants to see him.

753
00:45:28,527 --> 00:45:29,610
- Jin-hyeok?
- Yes.

754
00:45:29,694 --> 00:45:30,735
- Why?
- He...

755
00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:33,277
Why are you grabbing him like that?

756
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,944
Are you a cop now?

757
00:45:36,527 --> 00:45:38,485
We need to talk.

758
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,694
Stay right here, loser.

759
00:45:42,444 --> 00:45:43,485
What?

760
00:45:44,402 --> 00:45:45,777
You're getting on my nerves.

761
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:47,735
Hey.

762
00:45:48,652 --> 00:45:49,777
Are you insane?

763
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:50,985
I don't care what Jin-hyeok said.

764
00:45:51,069 --> 00:45:52,527
Let him go.

765
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,860
We need to talk.

766
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,819
But Jin-hyeok said to bring him to him.

767
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,319
Why?

768
00:46:08,402 --> 00:46:11,860
It probably has to do with Yang Chae-young.

769
00:46:18,152 --> 00:46:19,819
Are you guys part of it?

770
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,277
I heard four students ganged up on him

771
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,652
because he wouldn't help them cheat.

772
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,735
If we don't take him to Jin-hyeok...

773
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:31,194
Hell! I must have been too nice to you.

774
00:46:31,277 --> 00:46:33,735
Did you forget who I am?

775
00:46:38,985 --> 00:46:41,194
I didn't forget, you moron.

776
00:46:41,735 --> 00:46:44,527
See that? He's no match for me.

777
00:46:46,652 --> 00:46:49,235
I know who you are. You're nothing.

778
00:46:57,777 --> 00:47:00,652
See that? See how I brought him down?

779
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:02,485
Is this him?

780
00:47:06,027 --> 00:47:08,569
Jin-hyeok's waiting. Let's go.

781
00:47:13,485 --> 00:47:14,944
Jeong Jong-gu!

782
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,735
Are you going to skip karate practice today?

783
00:47:20,694 --> 00:47:23,485
I heard we had a crazy witch in school.

784
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:25,402
Is that you, Yang Chae-young?

785
00:47:26,194 --> 00:47:27,235
Are you crazy?

786
00:47:27,319 --> 00:47:28,860
I'm your senior. Bow to me.

787
00:47:28,944 --> 00:47:30,569
Not you guys again.

788
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:34,485
I'll say it nicely. Let him go.

789
00:47:34,569 --> 00:47:37,319
We can't. Jin-hyeok's orders.

790
00:47:38,152 --> 00:47:40,027
You can try to take him.

791
00:47:40,402 --> 00:47:41,985
You said it.

792
00:47:45,485 --> 00:47:47,694
She's one crazy skank.

793
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:09,902
Where the hell do you think you're going?

794
00:48:11,319 --> 00:48:12,527
You friggin' skank.

795
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:15,819
It's not over yet!

796
00:48:18,652 --> 00:48:20,860
Does it hurt? You want more?

797
00:48:20,944 --> 00:48:21,985
Baek Gang-shik!

798
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,485
It's OK.

799
00:49:01,569 --> 00:49:03,069
You didn't do anything wrong.

800
00:49:04,569 --> 00:49:06,235
See you later at the dojo.

801
00:49:17,485 --> 00:49:20,652
Hey, wait. Come here.

802
00:49:23,402 --> 00:49:26,944
Jeong Jong-gu? I like your name.

803
00:49:27,027 --> 00:49:31,444
Hey, are you close to Yang Chae-young?

804
00:49:31,527 --> 00:49:32,902
Yes...

805
00:49:33,819 --> 00:49:36,027
Where are you going to meet her?

806
00:49:36,777 --> 00:49:38,985
"Justice without power is hollow."

807
00:49:39,069 --> 00:49:41,069
"But power without justice is merely violence."

808
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,985
Master Choi Bae-dal said that.

809
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:45,485
That's him.

810
00:49:46,402 --> 00:49:48,944
Karate sounds like a Japanese martial art

811
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,902
but it actually originated in ancient India.

812
00:49:50,985 --> 00:49:52,027
It was brought in during the Tang Dynasty

813
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:53,610
so it's also called <i>tangsoodo</i>.

814
00:49:54,152 --> 00:49:56,777
We do not rely on weapons to inflict damage.

815
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,110
"Kara" meaning empty. "Te" meaning hand.

816
00:49:59,194 --> 00:50:03,027
Dominating your opponent with bare hands.

817
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:05,527
That's karate.

818
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:09,360
- I'll sign up.
- Sign here, please.

819
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,944
You get a 50% discount for the first month.

820
00:50:13,402 --> 00:50:14,777
Can I start today?

821
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:16,902
You're full of passion.

822
00:50:16,985 --> 00:50:19,902
Sure, then...

823
00:50:20,527 --> 00:50:21,777
Let's see.

824
00:50:24,235 --> 00:50:25,485
Here.

825
00:50:25,735 --> 00:50:27,277
Change into this.

826
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,110
The locker room is on your right.

827
00:50:33,485 --> 00:50:34,777
Hey, Jong-gu.

828
00:50:39,985 --> 00:50:41,235
Here.

829
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:13,819
Yang Chae-young, nice to meet you.

830
00:51:15,194 --> 00:51:16,944
Why is he here?

831
00:51:17,027 --> 00:51:18,819
It's because...

832
00:51:18,902 --> 00:51:22,527
He told me to come here to be strong like you.

833
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,069
I did?

834
00:51:24,402 --> 00:51:26,694
- That was what you said.
- When?

835
00:51:26,777 --> 00:51:28,402
You did. Nice to meet you.

836
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:33,235
Aren't you one of the school bullies?

837
00:51:33,694 --> 00:51:35,194
What are you doing here?

838
00:51:36,027 --> 00:51:37,902
I'm not with them anymore.

839
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:41,277
I really want to learn karate.

840
00:51:41,944 --> 00:51:43,569
You were really awesome earlier today.

841
00:51:46,027 --> 00:51:47,444
Sure.

842
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:53,819
When did I say that?

843
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,444
You did.

844
00:51:55,527 --> 00:51:56,819
When?

845
00:51:56,902 --> 00:51:59,985
Earlier... Jump rope. Let's jump rope.

846
00:52:05,694 --> 00:52:06,944
Hey!

847
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:10,610
Why didn't you greet me?

848
00:52:13,694 --> 00:52:14,819
Don't you know me?

849
00:52:19,902 --> 00:52:21,694
Hey... hey!

850
00:52:29,194 --> 00:52:32,569
You may be a good fighter, but I'm your senior.

851
00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:34,819
Have some manners.

852
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:37,194
I'm not the only one who thinks

853
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:39,277
you're a thorn in the side.

854
00:52:40,902 --> 00:52:42,319
What are you doing here?

855
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,610
Do you have something to tell her?

856
00:52:48,485 --> 00:52:49,735
Run along then.

857
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:56,944
Joo Hae-seong!

858
00:52:58,985 --> 00:53:01,235
She disrespects the senior students.

859
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:03,110
Are you OK with that?

860
00:53:03,777 --> 00:53:05,944
Hey, don't do this in public.

861
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,069
I'm off.

862
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,402
Hey!

863
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:13,860
What?

864
00:53:14,652 --> 00:53:16,277
You've changed.

865
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:20,694
You don't answer my calls.

866
00:53:20,777 --> 00:53:22,860
You get impatient when I talk to you.

867
00:53:24,485 --> 00:53:25,777
Do you...

868
00:53:34,652 --> 00:53:36,235
Sae-na...

869
00:53:37,777 --> 00:53:39,027
Hey, Joo Hae-seong!

870
00:53:40,027 --> 00:53:41,735
You knew all along, don't you?

871
00:53:42,194 --> 00:53:43,819
You know I'm in love with you.

872
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,652
I'm madly in love with you.

873
00:53:47,027 --> 00:53:48,444
But you...

874
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:55,652
Sae-na.

875
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:58,610
We've been friends for six years. Yeah?

876
00:54:00,444 --> 00:54:02,235
I'd hate to lose a friend.

877
00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:07,069
I'm off.

878
00:54:12,902 --> 00:54:14,152
Chae-young!

879
00:54:21,152 --> 00:54:22,735
You're so persistent.

880
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:24,319
No, I mean, today...

881
00:54:24,402 --> 00:54:26,152
Fine, I'll walk back with you.

882
00:54:29,277 --> 00:54:31,027
Thank you, but...

883
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:33,027
It's no big deal.

884
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:35,235
Let's just walk without the chit chat.

885
00:54:35,527 --> 00:54:37,152
No, I mean, today...

886
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:38,277
Sweetie!

887
00:54:38,944 --> 00:54:40,194
Dad.

888
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:41,985
What brings you here?

889
00:54:42,069 --> 00:54:44,360
I was just passing by.

890
00:54:44,444 --> 00:54:46,527
- Jong-gu?
- Hello, sir.

891
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:47,735
Hop on. I'm going to the dojo.

892
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:49,360
No, sorry.

893
00:54:49,444 --> 00:54:51,652
My mum fell sick.

894
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:54,235
I was trying to tell you I can't make it today.

895
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:57,444
I see. Gosh, you're a good son.

896
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:00,110
Take good care of your mum. See you.

897
00:55:00,194 --> 00:55:01,777
- Bye, sir.
- Sweetie, get in.

898
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,069
Let's walk back together tomorrow.

899
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:06,735
That won't be necessary.

900
00:55:11,985 --> 00:55:13,527
Leave me alone.

901
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,694
Let's walk together tomorrow...

902
00:55:14,777 --> 00:55:16,652
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye, sir.

903
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,360
Take care!

904
00:55:31,985 --> 00:55:33,235
Hi.

905
00:55:37,235 --> 00:55:38,527
You're alone.

906
00:55:39,194 --> 00:55:40,610
Can I help you?

907
00:55:40,694 --> 00:55:41,985
Ball...

908
00:55:42,902 --> 00:55:44,360
Belt...

909
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:54,110
Honestly, why are you here?

910
00:55:56,194 --> 00:55:57,860
To learn karate.

911
00:55:58,485 --> 00:55:59,735
It's the truth.

912
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:04,319
You box?

913
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:09,235
Yeah. I used to box in middle school.

914
00:56:12,152 --> 00:56:14,902
Does everyone look weak because you can box?

915
00:56:16,735 --> 00:56:17,985
Hanging out with your clique

916
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:19,360
and bullying the weak.

917
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:20,985
Nothing wrong with that, huh?

918
00:56:24,277 --> 00:56:26,694
- That's...
- Go one round with me.

919
00:56:27,819 --> 00:56:29,819
No, Chae-young.

920
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,069
He just signed up a few days ago.

921
00:56:33,652 --> 00:56:37,569
No, it's a good idea but...

922
00:56:37,652 --> 00:56:40,902
Go easy, OK? Go easy.

923
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:44,527
Chae-young, this is...

924
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,819
Yes, this is so wrong!

925
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,735
Is it because I'm a girl?

926
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:48,985
No, I mean...

927
00:56:49,444 --> 00:56:52,110
- That's not why.
- I...

928
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:54,360
I just started learning karate.

929
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:56,569
Yes, he just signed up.

930
00:56:56,652 --> 00:56:59,402
You can box or do whatever you want.

931
00:57:00,069 --> 00:57:02,027
But sparring is sparring.

932
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:03,735
So here and...

933
00:57:04,194 --> 00:57:06,985
there's off limits. Fair play.

934
00:57:09,694 --> 00:57:11,194
Ready.

935
00:57:11,277 --> 00:57:12,527
Fight!

936
00:57:25,027 --> 00:57:26,402
Easy, easy!

937
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:36,110
Go easy on him...

938
00:57:39,444 --> 00:57:40,610
Are you OK?

939
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:53,902
Chae-young!

940
00:57:59,027 --> 00:58:01,110
Even when you can

941
00:58:01,194 --> 00:58:03,485
sometimes you must not.

942
00:58:06,944 --> 00:58:09,319
"Power without justice is merely violence."

943
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:10,944
Don't you know?

944
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:20,694
Give me just one more week.

945
00:58:21,944 --> 00:58:24,569
What? Your boss wants me?

946
00:58:25,527 --> 00:58:28,569
Of course I appreciate it!

947
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:32,152
I'll have the money soon, Sang-jin. So...

948
00:58:32,485 --> 00:58:35,819
put in a good word for me, please.

949
00:58:36,819 --> 00:58:40,235
OK, bye. I'm counting on you.

950
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:55,360
Baek Gang-shik.

951
00:58:56,194 --> 00:58:59,485
Can't think straight after a girl beat you up?

952
00:59:01,402 --> 00:59:03,194
Hurry it up.

953
00:59:03,277 --> 00:59:05,902
Get the collections done by this week.

954
00:59:19,819 --> 00:59:21,069
Come here.

955
00:59:22,777 --> 00:59:24,235
I'm opening the door.

956
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,652
<i>No Smoking</i>

957
00:59:28,694 --> 00:59:30,152
Here it is.

958
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:45,110
Show me what you've got.

959
00:59:45,194 --> 00:59:48,777
So that I know I can trust you.

960
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:51,444
I'm sorry!

961
00:59:51,527 --> 00:59:54,485
Don't forget next time, OK?

962
00:59:57,277 --> 01:00:01,360
And just leave that crazy witch alone.

963
01:00:02,152 --> 01:00:04,735
I know what I'm going to do.

964
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:11,235
What are you doing?

965
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,819
What the hell is this?

966
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:18,735
May I sit with you?

967
01:00:19,444 --> 01:00:22,152
It's time to go play.

968
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,152
Come with me.

969
01:00:25,902 --> 01:00:28,235
Let's go.

970
01:00:30,944 --> 01:00:32,444
Turn right.

971
01:00:33,194 --> 01:00:36,319
Hey... clench your teeth.

972
01:00:36,402 --> 01:00:38,152
Bloody loser!

973
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:40,735
You're the only one who didn't pay.

974
01:00:40,819 --> 01:00:42,569
He's such a twerp.

975
01:00:42,652 --> 01:00:44,360
Bloody loser.

976
01:00:44,444 --> 01:00:47,277
I'm saving up for my mum's birthday gift.

977
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:50,444
"I'm saving up for my mum's birthday gift."

978
01:00:50,527 --> 01:00:53,777
"Not for Daddy, for my mummy darling."

979
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,069
Hey, twerp.

980
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:57,652
He was saving up to get his mum a present.

981
01:00:57,735 --> 01:00:58,777
So?

982
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,610
Cut him some slack, you tosser.

983
01:01:00,694 --> 01:01:03,319
What did you call me? Hell...

984
01:01:04,069 --> 01:01:07,860
Did you think I would do that?

985
01:01:08,277 --> 01:01:09,777
Bloody hell.

986
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:13,360
This moron is full of crap.

987
01:01:13,444 --> 01:01:15,777
- You friggin' loser.
- Hey...

988
01:01:17,569 --> 01:01:21,194
Hell, you startled me.

989
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:22,527
Hey...

990
01:01:24,402 --> 01:01:26,652
Just get out of here when I'm being nice.

991
01:01:27,277 --> 01:01:29,277
What is it? You need to take a crap?

992
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,485
- Go poop somewhere else!
- Cut it out.

993
01:01:33,694 --> 01:01:35,652
Bloody hell!

994
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:40,527
Jong-gu, can't you leave us alone?

995
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:42,360
I don't want to rough you up.

996
01:01:42,444 --> 01:01:43,652
You bloody moron.

997
01:01:43,735 --> 01:01:45,402
Why are you always picking on the quiet kids?

998
01:01:46,985 --> 01:01:48,735
Do something to him.

999
01:01:48,819 --> 01:01:50,194
Bloody hell.

1000
01:01:55,485 --> 01:01:57,360
You bloody schmuck!

1001
01:01:57,652 --> 01:02:01,027
Aren't you persistent?

1002
01:02:02,402 --> 01:02:04,235
Hey, Chae-young is not here.

1003
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:06,194
You don't want to mess with us.

1004
01:02:07,527 --> 01:02:08,652
What's wrong with you, retard?

1005
01:02:08,735 --> 01:02:10,235
I said stop.

1006
01:02:10,902 --> 01:02:12,277
You bloody schmuck...

1007
01:02:13,194 --> 01:02:15,069
- Hell!
- Are you crazy?

1008
01:02:15,152 --> 01:02:16,652
Gyeong-nam, go get our homeroom teacher!

1009
01:02:16,735 --> 01:02:18,485
- Hell.
- Hurry up!

1010
01:02:21,444 --> 01:02:23,944
Hey, what are you doing?

1011
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,569
Do you want to date me?

1012
01:02:38,985 --> 01:02:41,277
Are you hungry now?

1013
01:02:43,694 --> 01:02:44,777
You startled me!

1014
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,652
It's you.

1015
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:53,944
Why are you so early?

1016
01:02:55,527 --> 01:02:56,777
Where's Chae-young?

1017
01:02:58,569 --> 01:02:59,985
By the way...

1018
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,194
what's with your school uniform?

1019
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,485
Did you fall down or something?

1020
01:03:04,569 --> 01:03:05,819
No.

1021
01:03:06,194 --> 01:03:07,819
What else could it...

1022
01:03:14,027 --> 01:03:15,569
You got into a fight?

1023
01:03:18,735 --> 01:03:20,735
I wish I did.

1024
01:03:22,194 --> 01:03:23,819
As it is, I just got beaten up.

1025
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,902
What happened?

1026
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:44,735
Tell me.

1027
01:03:49,569 --> 01:03:52,610
I wanted to help my friend, but I couldn't.

1028
01:03:54,985 --> 01:03:56,444
Master.

1029
01:03:57,527 --> 01:04:00,110
When can I be strong?

1030
01:04:01,569 --> 01:04:04,569
I'm sick of being beaten up all the time.

1031
01:04:05,777 --> 01:04:07,194
I can't do anything on my own without help

1032
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:10,652
and I always get beaten up. I'm pathetic!

1033
01:04:12,444 --> 01:04:13,860
Jong-gu.

1034
01:04:16,902 --> 01:04:20,569
Everyone gives help and receives help.

1035
01:04:20,652 --> 01:04:22,319
That's how things are supposed to be.

1036
01:04:22,735 --> 01:04:24,777
There's nothing pathetic about it.

1037
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,777
I want to give help too

1038
01:04:28,485 --> 01:04:30,110
for a change.

1039
01:04:34,985 --> 01:04:37,360
It's impossible to suddenly become

1040
01:04:37,444 --> 01:04:38,694
a good fighter.

1041
01:04:41,985 --> 01:04:43,819
If you want to do that, mixed martial arts

1042
01:04:43,902 --> 01:04:45,610
might be better for you.

1043
01:04:47,819 --> 01:04:49,069
But...

1044
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,444
I'll teach you a useful karate technique.

1045
01:04:54,152 --> 01:04:57,777
With enough practice, it's powerful.

1046
01:04:57,985 --> 01:04:59,277
So it all depends on you.

1047
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,902
What do I need to do?

1048
01:05:00,985 --> 01:05:02,527
Practise until you master it.

1049
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:04,110
What's this technique?

1050
01:05:08,194 --> 01:05:09,235
Hand!

1051
01:05:10,819 --> 01:05:12,069
Hand?

1052
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:20,902
That's it.

1053
01:05:23,569 --> 01:05:24,819
How?

1054
01:05:25,944 --> 01:05:27,444
Karate chop.

1055
01:05:28,652 --> 01:05:30,319
People usually think of

1056
01:05:30,402 --> 01:05:33,402
using a fist or a palm to attack.

1057
01:05:33,485 --> 01:05:36,402
There's an attack using the edge of the hand

1058
01:05:36,485 --> 01:05:38,444
called the karate chop.

1059
01:05:40,985 --> 01:05:44,569
Softer than a fist so it requires much practice

1060
01:05:44,652 --> 01:05:46,819
but the narrow area of contact

1061
01:05:46,902 --> 01:05:48,694
inflicts double the damage!

1062
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,985
An expert's karate chop

1063
01:05:52,069 --> 01:05:55,110
is no different from the blade of a sword.

1064
01:05:58,902 --> 01:06:00,985
Right? I like green onions too

1065
01:06:01,069 --> 01:06:03,110
- Same here.
- Put the noodles in.

1066
01:06:03,444 --> 01:06:05,110
It's not that I don't want to go.

1067
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:08,110
I can't. I'm going for training.

1068
01:06:08,485 --> 01:06:09,610
Are you trying to get into a sports school?

1069
01:06:09,694 --> 01:06:11,402
Why are you training?

1070
01:06:11,944 --> 01:06:13,235
What sort of training?

1071
01:06:13,944 --> 01:06:15,569
Are you trying to get into a music school?

1072
01:06:15,652 --> 01:06:17,319
Why karaoke out of the blue?

1073
01:06:17,402 --> 01:06:19,152
This is not out of the blue.

1074
01:06:19,235 --> 01:06:21,527
Anyway, I'm off. Have fun!

1075
01:06:31,485 --> 01:06:32,860
Chae-young...

1076
01:06:33,777 --> 01:06:36,360
- What are you doing here?
- I was...

1077
01:06:36,444 --> 01:06:38,402
It hurts where you hit me yesterday.

1078
01:06:38,485 --> 01:06:39,569
So I couldn't sleep...

1079
01:06:39,652 --> 01:06:42,694
- You look fine.
- No, I...

1080
01:06:42,777 --> 01:06:44,569
Here and here.

1081
01:06:44,652 --> 01:06:47,610
My thighs and back are all bruised.

1082
01:06:47,694 --> 01:06:48,819
I didn't hit you there.

1083
01:06:49,527 --> 01:06:50,902
Really?

1084
01:06:50,985 --> 01:06:53,402
You don't have to apologise.

1085
01:06:53,735 --> 01:06:54,985
Just buy me dinner.

1086
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:57,485
Bye.

1087
01:06:59,569 --> 01:07:01,319
Hey, let's walk together.

1088
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:04,652
One thousand times.

1089
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,610
One.

1090
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:12,235
One thousand times, really?

1091
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,652
Two.

1092
01:07:15,985 --> 01:07:17,235
Three.

1093
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:22,985
You need to do it a thousand times.

1094
01:07:31,652 --> 01:07:33,569
Four. Oh!

1095
01:07:34,444 --> 01:07:36,319
I thought you quit.

1096
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:39,194
I'll train hard, sir.

1097
01:07:39,277 --> 01:07:40,569
Please teach me.

1098
01:07:41,277 --> 01:07:42,319
Sure.

1099
01:07:42,944 --> 01:07:43,985
Get changed in the locker room.

1100
01:07:47,694 --> 01:07:48,944
Five.

1101
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:57,402
<i>Osu!</i>

1102
01:07:58,735 --> 01:07:59,985
<i>Osu.</i>

1103
01:08:09,902 --> 01:08:11,152
<i>Osu.</i>

1104
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:14,860
<i>Osu.</i>

1105
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,652
Ouch!

1106
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,735
Back into it.

1107
01:09:03,027 --> 01:09:05,277
I got ice cream!

1108
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,652
- Why?
- Here.

1109
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:05,360
Here.

1110
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:07,027
Say "ah".

1111
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:29,235
Honestly, I order it because you guys love it

1112
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:30,985
but I'm sick of black bean noodles.

1113
01:10:31,069 --> 01:10:32,527
Same here, sir.

1114
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:34,319
Hae-seong likes it too much!

1115
01:10:34,402 --> 01:10:35,569
I see...

1116
01:10:35,652 --> 01:10:37,402
He eats so slowly because he's savouring it.

1117
01:10:37,485 --> 01:10:39,819
- Does he?
- Of course.

1118
01:10:58,277 --> 01:10:59,360
Did you buy a roaming plan?

1119
01:10:59,444 --> 01:11:01,444
I'll do it at the airport.

1120
01:11:01,527 --> 01:11:03,777
I'll be busy, so I won't be calling you much.

1121
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:06,152
You'll be busy drinking, you mean.

1122
01:11:06,235 --> 01:11:09,819
Sweetie, you know me too well.

1123
01:11:10,152 --> 01:11:13,610
Drinking is like a prerequisite for adults.

1124
01:11:13,694 --> 01:11:16,277
- Just go, you'll be late.
- OK.

1125
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:19,360
- No eating on the mat!
- OK.

1126
01:11:19,444 --> 01:11:20,944
Make sure you lock the door, OK?

1127
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,360
Right, Chae-young.

1128
01:11:24,444 --> 01:11:26,360
Run the washer.

1129
01:11:26,735 --> 01:11:28,194
- Got it.
- Wait.

1130
01:11:28,277 --> 01:11:30,027
Are you having your finals this week?

1131
01:11:31,569 --> 01:11:32,694
Dad.

1132
01:11:32,777 --> 01:11:34,152
You're late.

1133
01:11:35,069 --> 01:11:37,777
Boy, I'm late! Bye. Wait!

1134
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:38,902
You guys.

1135
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:41,860
Look after Chae-young, OK?

1136
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,402
- Yes.
- OK! Bye!

1137
01:11:46,985 --> 01:11:49,069
- Bye.
- Have a safe trip.

1138
01:11:56,444 --> 01:11:58,569
You don't have to come for practice

1139
01:11:59,694 --> 01:12:01,444
until he returns.

1140
01:12:01,527 --> 01:12:03,694
- Then...
- Really?

1141
01:12:04,485 --> 01:12:06,027
I want to be here every day.

1142
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:07,819
I have nothing to do at home.

1143
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:10,110
Jong-gu, what about you?

1144
01:12:10,194 --> 01:12:12,735
Same here. May I?

1145
01:12:12,819 --> 01:12:16,444
Of course not, you schmucks.

1146
01:12:17,694 --> 01:12:18,944
Hey.

1147
01:12:20,194 --> 01:12:22,360
Am I asking you for money?

1148
01:12:23,652 --> 01:12:25,444
Did I ask you for money?

1149
01:12:25,527 --> 01:12:27,569
I'm giving you money, you schmucks.

1150
01:12:27,652 --> 01:12:29,360
So what's there to think about?

1151
01:12:31,235 --> 01:12:32,277
Hey.

1152
01:12:33,527 --> 01:12:35,652
You only gave me five minutes

1153
01:12:35,735 --> 01:12:37,277
to copy your answers in the English exam.

1154
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,402
You wanted me to flunk, don't you?

1155
01:12:42,819 --> 01:12:43,860
Try copying all the answers

1156
01:12:43,944 --> 01:12:45,569
with just five minutes on the clock!

1157
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:47,444
You friggin' schmuck! You try doing that!

1158
01:12:47,527 --> 01:12:50,694
You bloody son-of-a-gun!

1159
01:12:52,652 --> 01:12:54,444
That friggin' English exam.

1160
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,944
This is all your fault, scumbag!

1161
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,069
Hell, I broke a sweat.

1162
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:04,027
Get up!

1163
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:12,985
Anyway, change seats in maths class. OK?

1164
01:13:14,152 --> 01:13:16,652
He's very poor at maths.

1165
01:13:17,444 --> 01:13:18,860
Don't you get it?

1166
01:13:18,944 --> 01:13:22,110
You studied so hard, share it with me!

1167
01:13:22,194 --> 01:13:25,027
Hey! I'm Park Jin-hyeok, mind you.

1168
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:27,027
What?

1169
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:28,819
You want to mess up my life?

1170
01:13:28,902 --> 01:13:31,985
If that happens, you guys are dead.

1171
01:13:32,069 --> 01:13:34,194
If I mess up the final exams

1172
01:13:34,277 --> 01:13:35,944
you won't get to take the KSAT.

1173
01:13:36,027 --> 01:13:37,402
You know why?

1174
01:13:38,069 --> 01:13:40,694
Because I'll cut off all your fingers.

1175
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:53,944
- Jong-gu.
- Yes?

1176
01:13:54,444 --> 01:13:56,319
The exams are over. What are you doing tomorrow?

1177
01:13:56,402 --> 01:13:57,485
Nothing.

1178
01:13:57,569 --> 01:13:59,694
Oh, you want to watch a movie?

1179
01:13:59,777 --> 01:14:02,694
Good. My friend gave me three movie tickets.

1180
01:14:02,777 --> 01:14:04,402
Three tickets?

1181
01:14:05,319 --> 01:14:08,777
He gave me three tickets, not two.

1182
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:10,110
Right.

1183
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:14,027
Hey, the three of us could go, right?

1184
01:14:14,985 --> 01:14:16,235
Sure.

1185
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:18,402
I'll pass.

1186
01:14:18,485 --> 01:14:19,944
No, wait...

1187
01:14:21,235 --> 01:14:26,110
What do I do with the spare ticket then?

1188
01:14:26,194 --> 01:14:27,485
I have no one to give it to

1189
01:14:27,569 --> 01:14:29,402
and it's going to expire soon.

1190
01:14:29,485 --> 01:14:31,069
- Right?
- Yes.

1191
01:14:32,235 --> 01:14:34,277
No, I'll pass.

1192
01:14:35,069 --> 01:14:37,819
Chae-young! Sorry...

1193
01:14:39,819 --> 01:14:41,944
Won't you catch a movie with us?

1194
01:14:42,027 --> 01:14:43,485
Yeah.

1195
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:45,569
Let's go together.

1196
01:14:52,485 --> 01:14:54,902
The president was a zombie.

1197
01:14:54,985 --> 01:14:56,027
Wasn't that awesome?

1198
01:14:56,110 --> 01:14:58,902
He didn't fall, so he must be a zombie.

1199
01:14:58,985 --> 01:15:00,902
- That's right.
- No, I think...

1200
01:15:00,985 --> 01:15:02,860
The gate to the Blue House was open.

1201
01:15:02,944 --> 01:15:05,902
Right? He didn't die in the end.

1202
01:15:05,985 --> 01:15:07,985
They must be making a sequel.

1203
01:15:09,819 --> 01:15:11,444
Chae-young, you must be hungry.

1204
01:15:11,527 --> 01:15:13,277
You're eating a lot of popcorn.

1205
01:15:14,985 --> 01:15:16,944
I'm not hungry, I have popcorn.

1206
01:15:18,027 --> 01:15:19,402
Wait.

1207
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:21,069
Who's stomach did I hear rumbling

1208
01:15:21,152 --> 01:15:22,402
during the movie?

1209
01:15:22,485 --> 01:15:23,652
That was...

1210
01:15:24,235 --> 01:15:26,402
It was you, right?

1211
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:27,735
- Not me.
- It's all right.

1212
01:15:27,819 --> 01:15:30,152
- It wasn't me!
- OK then, let's have dinner.

1213
01:15:30,235 --> 01:15:33,027
How about rice cakes or...

1214
01:15:33,652 --> 01:15:35,944
Udon? Anything but black bean noodles for me.

1215
01:15:37,027 --> 01:15:40,235
Why spend money? Let's just go home and eat.

1216
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:43,402
Wait! How about this...

1217
01:15:44,735 --> 01:15:46,652
We do karate, right?

1218
01:15:46,735 --> 01:15:49,777
How about we play a game? Loser buys.

1219
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:52,069
Right now?

1220
01:16:13,985 --> 01:16:15,319
Hell.

1221
01:16:15,402 --> 01:16:18,902
You see that? The rim moved!

1222
01:16:18,985 --> 01:16:20,985
This machine is really weird!

1223
01:16:21,069 --> 01:16:22,277
This machine is no good.

1224
01:16:22,694 --> 01:16:23,735
Something's wrong with it.

1225
01:16:23,985 --> 01:16:25,735
This is nothing like karate, right?

1226
01:16:25,819 --> 01:16:26,985
A deal's a deal.

1227
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:29,319
It's Jong-gu's turn now.

1228
01:16:29,944 --> 01:16:31,610
Isn't my score high?

1229
01:16:31,902 --> 01:16:33,194
It's low.

1230
01:16:33,985 --> 01:16:36,277
That post is lower than the one at school.

1231
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:38,110
I've never been here.

1232
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:40,402
I see.

1233
01:16:40,777 --> 01:16:42,652
Give it a shot. Don't give up.

1234
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:04,819
Well-done, Jong-gu...

1235
01:17:08,569 --> 01:17:10,152
Jong-gu, you twerp...

1236
01:17:11,152 --> 01:17:13,194
Is there a punching machine here?

1237
01:17:15,902 --> 01:17:17,402
Let's make this the final game.

1238
01:17:33,902 --> 01:17:35,569
This is so wrong.

1239
01:17:47,777 --> 01:17:50,652
Jong-gu. Where are we?

1240
01:17:50,735 --> 01:17:53,527
The most delicious kimchi stew place in Korea.

1241
01:17:54,485 --> 01:17:56,777
It's not too expensive, right?

1242
01:17:56,860 --> 01:17:58,819
- It's free.
- Free?

1243
01:17:58,902 --> 01:18:01,194
Yeah. Because we know karate.

1244
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:05,694
Hey.

1245
01:18:05,777 --> 01:18:08,319
You should've told us it's your mum's diner.

1246
01:18:08,402 --> 01:18:09,694
You never told me

1247
01:18:09,777 --> 01:18:11,277
it was your dad's dojo either.

1248
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:16,069
You guys must be hungry.

1249
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:18,902
This is the first time

1250
01:18:18,985 --> 01:18:20,402
Jong-gu has brought his friends here.

1251
01:18:21,777 --> 01:18:23,819
Please help yourselves.

1252
01:18:23,902 --> 01:18:24,944
OK.

1253
01:18:25,027 --> 01:18:26,444
- Mum.
- Yeah?

1254
01:18:26,527 --> 01:18:28,235
This is my senior at school.

1255
01:18:28,944 --> 01:18:30,819
We go to the same karate dojo.

1256
01:18:31,569 --> 01:18:34,485
- Hello.
- My, you're so handsome.

1257
01:18:34,944 --> 01:18:38,277
Please take good care of Jong-gu.

1258
01:18:38,694 --> 01:18:41,694
Sure, ma'am. For sure, yes.

1259
01:18:42,069 --> 01:18:43,860
Mum, this is Yang Chae-young.

1260
01:18:43,944 --> 01:18:47,485
She's my classmate and my master's daughter.

1261
01:18:47,569 --> 01:18:48,610
How do you do.

1262
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:50,610
My, what a lovely young lady.

1263
01:18:50,694 --> 01:18:53,235
Thank you for being friends with Jong-gu.

1264
01:18:53,319 --> 01:18:54,860
Thank you.

1265
01:18:54,944 --> 01:18:56,444
Eat lots, OK?

1266
01:18:57,152 --> 01:18:59,069
If you need more, just let me know.

1267
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:01,735
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

1268
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:06,360
Jong-gu.

1269
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:10,944
You eat such good food every day?

1270
01:19:11,652 --> 01:19:12,985
I envy you.

1271
01:19:13,652 --> 01:19:15,652
My mum was always telling me

1272
01:19:15,735 --> 01:19:17,777
to bring my friends here.

1273
01:19:18,402 --> 01:19:20,069
Thank you for coming here with me.

1274
01:19:20,735 --> 01:19:22,360
Thank you, Senior.

1275
01:19:26,485 --> 01:19:27,527
Jong-gu.

1276
01:19:30,569 --> 01:19:33,110
You can just call me Hae-seong.

1277
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:38,069
Hae-seong.

1278
01:19:43,235 --> 01:19:44,652
Have some meat.

1279
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:06,069
- Hae-seong.
- Yeah?

1280
01:20:07,152 --> 01:20:08,235
Why do you act all chummy

1281
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:10,152
with Jong-gu and me?

1282
01:20:12,152 --> 01:20:14,735
Hey, it's not an act.

1283
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:17,069
I really want to be friends.

1284
01:20:17,485 --> 01:20:19,027
But why?

1285
01:20:19,485 --> 01:20:21,027
What do you mean why?

1286
01:20:21,485 --> 01:20:23,527
We do karate together.

1287
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:25,319
You guys are nice and fun.

1288
01:20:25,985 --> 01:20:28,819
You shouldn't look for fun here.

1289
01:20:29,152 --> 01:20:30,902
You're friends with those school bullies.

1290
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:36,569
Jong-gu gets bullied by people like you.

1291
01:20:36,652 --> 01:20:37,902
You know that, right?

1292
01:20:38,985 --> 01:20:42,194
You know why they beat him up

1293
01:20:42,277 --> 01:20:44,194
and pick on him for no reason?

1294
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:48,069
It's their idea of fun.

1295
01:20:49,985 --> 01:20:52,235
That's not what any decent person would do.

1296
01:20:59,110 --> 01:21:00,235
I...

1297
01:21:02,235 --> 01:21:04,527
I was in the school's boxing club

1298
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,694
back in middle school.

1299
01:21:07,277 --> 01:21:10,777
I had a flair for it and even won a few medals.

1300
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,944
I was a decent boxer.

1301
01:21:13,569 --> 01:21:14,902
But...

1302
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,652
my coach was a drunk who beat me every day.

1303
01:21:17,735 --> 01:21:19,944
So I quit after two years.

1304
01:21:21,569 --> 01:21:23,777
I kind of lost my way after that.

1305
01:21:25,152 --> 01:21:27,027
I got into plenty of fights.

1306
01:21:32,527 --> 01:21:34,569
In the third year of middle school

1307
01:21:37,652 --> 01:21:38,735
there was a kid in the class next door

1308
01:21:38,819 --> 01:21:40,069
who was ostracised.

1309
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:43,610
He killed himself.

1310
01:21:46,194 --> 01:21:47,985
The bullies who tormented him...

1311
01:21:49,652 --> 01:21:51,569
were my friends.

1312
01:21:54,235 --> 01:21:56,069
One transferred to another school.

1313
01:21:57,277 --> 01:21:59,569
And the other got away with just a suspension.

1314
01:22:02,152 --> 01:22:04,110
But someone is dead because of them.

1315
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:09,735
I really wanted to mend my ways after that

1316
01:22:10,735 --> 01:22:12,027
but...

1317
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:14,652
I didn't know how.

1318
01:22:15,069 --> 01:22:17,319
The one thing I know how to do was fight.

1319
01:22:17,402 --> 01:22:18,985
And so I fought.

1320
01:22:19,819 --> 01:22:20,944
So...

1321
01:22:21,985 --> 01:22:23,985
when my friends called me...

1322
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:27,235
I just joined them.

1323
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:30,735
I didn't have friends

1324
01:22:32,069 --> 01:22:34,527
like you and Jong-gu around me.

1325
01:22:40,402 --> 01:22:43,069
I want to be a good person, not a thug.

1326
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:58,444
<i>Chae-young: You asleep?</i>

1327
01:23:02,152 --> 01:23:05,236
<i>Jong-gu: Not yet.</i>

1328
01:23:05,319 --> 01:23:09,777
<i>Chae-young: That was a great dinner.</i>

1329
01:23:09,861 --> 01:23:13,319
<i>Chae-young: Thanks.</i>

1330
01:23:23,444 --> 01:23:26,027
<i>Jong-gu: You're very welcome.</i>

1331
01:23:26,111 --> 01:23:31,569
<i>It sure is nice to have a mum. I wish...</i>

1332
01:23:41,777 --> 01:23:44,986
<i>Chae-young: Really enjoyed it. I'm beat.</i>

1333
01:23:45,069 --> 01:23:47,944
<i>Chae-young: I'm going to bed.</i>

1334
01:24:16,569 --> 01:24:18,277
<i>Jong-gu: Yeah, good night. See you tomorrow.</i>

1335
01:24:31,319 --> 01:24:32,569
Here.

1336
01:24:35,152 --> 01:24:36,527
I quit smoking.

1337
01:24:39,486 --> 01:24:40,902
What?

1338
01:24:42,152 --> 01:24:44,777
You've changed a lot.

1339
01:24:49,527 --> 01:24:51,319
What is it that you want to tell me?

1340
01:24:54,486 --> 01:24:56,027
Starting tomorrow, our school...

1341
01:24:57,736 --> 01:25:00,069
belongs to Gangbuk gang.

1342
01:25:10,902 --> 01:25:12,444
How did you get the money?

1343
01:25:13,361 --> 01:25:15,944
I passed around the hat. Why?

1344
01:25:18,569 --> 01:25:19,902
Park Jin-hyeok.

1345
01:25:21,486 --> 01:25:24,319
What is it you want?

1346
01:25:25,069 --> 01:25:27,819
Why would you want to live like this?

1347
01:25:28,861 --> 01:25:30,611
Bloody hell.

1348
01:25:30,694 --> 01:25:33,277
Just ride off on your high horse, scumbag!

1349
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:35,652
I know your school grades are crap.

1350
01:25:38,236 --> 01:25:39,944
You think I don't know?

1351
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:42,402
I know you cheated on the exams.

1352
01:25:47,861 --> 01:25:49,402
I'll get right to the point.

1353
01:25:50,402 --> 01:25:52,944
Sang-jin wants you at the general meeting.

1354
01:25:53,944 --> 01:25:56,194
I don't get why he likes you.

1355
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:59,069
You'll be there?

1356
01:26:00,902 --> 01:26:03,111
Tell him I won't be there.

1357
01:26:04,944 --> 01:26:06,236
Thank you.

1358
01:26:12,069 --> 01:26:13,319
I'm warning you not to bring

1359
01:26:13,402 --> 01:26:14,652
that gang stuff into our school.

1360
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:16,111
Or I'll make them sorry.

1361
01:26:16,694 --> 01:26:18,111
Bloody hell...

1362
01:26:21,444 --> 01:26:22,944
I'll make you sorry too.

1363
01:26:24,611 --> 01:26:26,194
You've been warned.

1364
01:26:32,736 --> 01:26:34,486
Bloody hell!

1365
01:26:36,152 --> 01:26:37,402
Hey.

1366
01:26:38,194 --> 01:26:41,527
Who are you to tell me what to do?

1367
01:26:42,111 --> 01:26:44,152
Who are you to ever tell me what to do?

1368
01:26:44,236 --> 01:26:45,902
You piece of crap, let's fight!

1369
01:26:45,986 --> 01:26:48,277
Hey, schmuck.

1370
01:26:48,361 --> 01:26:50,444
I can't even think straight right now.

1371
01:26:50,902 --> 01:26:52,986
Stop yapping and just take a swing at me.

1372
01:26:53,069 --> 01:26:54,527
Bring it on, bozo!

1373
01:26:54,611 --> 01:26:55,694
If I win the fight

1374
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:59,111
Yang Chae-young is dead, you schmuck.

1375
01:26:59,194 --> 01:27:01,069
You friggin' schmuck.

1376
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:07,069
Go to hell!

1377
01:28:05,777 --> 01:28:08,527
You friggin' loser! Lowlife rat!

1378
01:28:08,611 --> 01:28:11,944
What do you think I've been doing?

1379
01:28:12,027 --> 01:28:15,694
You think I'm still the old Park Jin-hyeok?

1380
01:28:15,777 --> 01:28:17,194
You piece of crap!

1381
01:28:17,277 --> 01:28:18,444
Bloody hell.

1382
01:28:18,527 --> 01:28:20,902
Hell... how dare you disrespect me?

1383
01:28:20,986 --> 01:28:22,402
How dare you!

1384
01:28:24,069 --> 01:28:27,361
You think you're a good fighter? Loser!

1385
01:28:28,277 --> 01:28:30,236
Bloody hell!

1386
01:28:38,402 --> 01:28:40,444
You fancy Lee Sae-na, don't you?

1387
01:28:40,902 --> 01:28:42,986
I know you like Lee Sae-na.

1388
01:28:43,069 --> 01:28:44,111
You think I don't know?

1389
01:28:45,986 --> 01:28:48,694
That's why I stayed away from her.

1390
01:28:48,777 --> 01:28:50,027
You need to grow up.

1391
01:28:50,777 --> 01:28:53,902
You friggin' scumbag!

1392
01:29:01,527 --> 01:29:03,611
Hell...

1393
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:11,111
Lay a finger on Yang Chae-young

1394
01:29:12,861 --> 01:29:14,736
and I will kill you.

1395
01:29:29,319 --> 01:29:31,027
Bloody hell...

1396
01:29:36,152 --> 01:29:37,986
Bloody hell!

1397
01:29:38,194 --> 01:29:39,444
98!

1398
01:29:39,527 --> 01:29:40,736
More!

1399
01:29:40,819 --> 01:29:42,236
99!

1400
01:29:42,361 --> 01:29:43,736
Straight!

1401
01:29:44,152 --> 01:29:45,402
100!

1402
01:29:46,402 --> 01:29:48,069
You're doing better.

1403
01:29:48,152 --> 01:29:50,861
- You've been working hard.
- No more.

1404
01:29:51,236 --> 01:29:53,027
Let's do 100 karate chops.

1405
01:29:54,611 --> 01:29:56,361
I'm not a robot.

1406
01:29:56,694 --> 01:29:58,777
I'm tired too.

1407
01:29:59,444 --> 01:30:00,611
You won't do it?

1408
01:30:00,694 --> 01:30:03,111
- No, I mean...
- Don't do it then.

1409
01:30:03,194 --> 01:30:05,236
No, I'll do it. Wait.

1410
01:30:11,152 --> 01:30:12,694
What happened to your face?

1411
01:30:17,819 --> 01:30:20,652
You told me you wanted to turn over a new leaf

1412
01:30:20,736 --> 01:30:22,319
and you got into another fight?

1413
01:30:22,402 --> 01:30:23,736
Easy, easy...

1414
01:30:47,236 --> 01:30:48,694
All done.

1415
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:52,736
Looks like I'll have to get injured more often.

1416
01:31:03,402 --> 01:31:05,194
You've been saying no.

1417
01:31:06,069 --> 01:31:08,527
- But here you are.
- What's that?

1418
01:31:10,069 --> 01:31:11,652
What happened to your face?

1419
01:31:15,736 --> 01:31:17,236
What's with you?

1420
01:31:17,861 --> 01:31:19,236
You're actually worried about me?

1421
01:31:24,402 --> 01:31:27,444
Hey, do you really like Joo Hae-seong?

1422
01:31:27,527 --> 01:31:28,736
He's such a show-off.

1423
01:31:30,152 --> 01:31:31,444
If you're just going to be talking crap

1424
01:31:31,527 --> 01:31:32,861
I'm leaving. I'm busy.

1425
01:31:32,944 --> 01:31:35,194
What's the rush?

1426
01:31:36,819 --> 01:31:39,569
Sit. Come on.

1427
01:31:49,027 --> 01:31:50,486
Hell...

1428
01:31:50,569 --> 01:31:52,277
These are my mum's pills.

1429
01:31:53,361 --> 01:31:55,236
Very potent sleeping pills.

1430
01:31:55,319 --> 01:31:56,652
Because of my old man

1431
01:31:56,736 --> 01:31:59,027
my mum can't sleep without them.

1432
01:31:59,569 --> 01:32:01,277
That friggin' scumbag.

1433
01:32:07,402 --> 01:32:08,444
Lee Sae-na.

1434
01:32:10,736 --> 01:32:12,819
- What?
- Do you really...

1435
01:32:17,402 --> 01:32:19,777
Do you really want Joo Hae-seong back?

1436
01:32:31,652 --> 01:32:33,361
I want you to do something

1437
01:32:42,819 --> 01:32:45,069
<i>Hi, I'm Sae-na.</i>

1438
01:32:45,819 --> 01:32:47,069
<i>I've been thinking and I think</i>

1439
01:32:47,152 --> 01:32:48,402
<i>I've been too mean to you.</i>

1440
01:32:49,527 --> 01:32:51,611
<i>I'd like to talk to you.</i>

1441
01:32:52,152 --> 01:32:53,361
<i>Can you come</i>

1442
01:32:53,444 --> 01:32:54,694
<i>to the student council office for a bit?</i>

1443
01:32:56,277 --> 01:32:58,736
<i>I just want to make peace with you.</i>

1444
01:32:59,444 --> 01:33:02,111
<i>Could you drop by just for a moment?</i>

1445
01:33:03,111 --> 01:33:04,611
<i>Please.</i>

1446
01:33:10,861 --> 01:33:12,236
Come on in.

1447
01:33:17,069 --> 01:33:19,402
Chae-young, thank you for coming.

1448
01:33:20,569 --> 01:33:22,527
What's going on?

1449
01:33:23,111 --> 01:33:24,944
Suddenly, you want to apologise to me?

1450
01:33:25,902 --> 01:33:27,777
Come, sit down.

1451
01:33:28,111 --> 01:33:29,361
Sit.

1452
01:33:39,986 --> 01:33:41,444
Chae-young.

1453
01:33:42,111 --> 01:33:44,277
I'm sorry about the other day.

1454
01:33:45,652 --> 01:33:49,694
I apologise for being rude to you too.

1455
01:33:49,777 --> 01:33:51,111
No.

1456
01:33:51,194 --> 01:33:53,069
No matter what the girls said

1457
01:33:53,152 --> 01:33:56,027
I shouldn't have taken sides.

1458
01:33:56,527 --> 01:33:57,861
I'm so sorry.

1459
01:33:59,486 --> 01:34:01,861
I was too mad to think straight

1460
01:34:02,152 --> 01:34:04,402
but after hearing what Hae-seong said

1461
01:34:04,486 --> 01:34:07,277
I realised I was wrong.

1462
01:34:12,402 --> 01:34:15,652
I hear Hae-seong goes to your dad's dojo.

1463
01:34:16,736 --> 01:34:18,694
You two must be really close.

1464
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:23,194
He's very athletic.

1465
01:34:25,277 --> 01:34:28,236
But we're not that close.

1466
01:34:28,819 --> 01:34:30,069
I see.

1467
01:34:32,736 --> 01:34:34,777
Can I tell you a secret?

1468
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:39,402
I told him I had feelings for him

1469
01:34:39,486 --> 01:34:40,569
but he turned me down.

1470
01:34:47,361 --> 01:34:50,611
You two seem like a great match.

1471
01:34:54,736 --> 01:34:56,527
Maybe he doesn't see me as a woman.

1472
01:34:56,611 --> 01:34:59,444
No way, you're so pretty.

1473
01:35:01,652 --> 01:35:02,694
Really?

1474
01:35:09,277 --> 01:35:13,486
Well, the heart wants what the heart wants.

1475
01:35:13,569 --> 01:35:14,611
I know he doesn't fancy me

1476
01:35:14,694 --> 01:35:15,736
but I can't seem to give up.

1477
01:35:17,152 --> 01:35:18,694
That's how it is.

1478
01:35:23,777 --> 01:35:25,652
Have some tea.

1479
01:35:25,736 --> 01:35:28,694
Right, yes. Thank you.

1480
01:35:29,152 --> 01:35:32,819
- You know what?
- What?

1481
01:35:33,819 --> 01:35:34,902
You're more naïve than I thought.

1482
01:35:37,319 --> 01:35:38,361
Yeah.

1483
01:35:39,944 --> 01:35:42,027
What the hell?

1484
01:35:42,861 --> 01:35:46,611
Sheesh. I'm leaving!

1485
01:35:48,236 --> 01:35:51,236
What's wrong? You look like a mess.

1486
01:35:51,652 --> 01:35:54,194
Wait. We have tissue paper somewhere.

1487
01:35:55,069 --> 01:35:56,111
Where's the tissue paper?

1488
01:35:57,611 --> 01:35:59,444
Lee Sae-na, why didn't you follow through?

1489
01:36:06,402 --> 01:36:07,736
That must hurt.

1490
01:36:11,402 --> 01:36:14,486
But you're not the only one who's hurt

1491
01:36:14,569 --> 01:36:16,569
so don't think this is unfair.

1492
01:36:19,861 --> 01:36:22,236
I hear you like taking videos.

1493
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:25,027
It's your turn to be on video today.

1494
01:36:40,027 --> 01:36:42,319
- I have big news.
- What?

1495
01:36:42,402 --> 01:36:43,652
Gang-shik told me they're teaching

1496
01:36:43,736 --> 01:36:45,194
Yang Chae-young a lesson today.

1497
01:36:46,277 --> 01:36:48,777
Jin-hyeok is going to beat her up.

1498
01:36:48,861 --> 01:36:53,694
It's her funeral today, dude!

1499
01:36:53,777 --> 01:36:56,444
It's long overdue.

1500
01:37:00,069 --> 01:37:01,569
- You're here.
- Hae-seong.

1501
01:37:03,652 --> 01:37:04,694
What's wrong?

1502
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:06,402
I think Chae-young may be in trouble.

1503
01:37:07,152 --> 01:37:10,194
Someone from student council called her.

1504
01:37:10,277 --> 01:37:11,652
And now her phone's turned off.

1505
01:37:11,986 --> 01:37:14,361
- Student council? Who?
- I have no idea.

1506
01:37:14,444 --> 01:37:15,902
I overheard some guys saying

1507
01:37:15,986 --> 01:37:18,277
they're going to do something to Chae-young.

1508
01:37:18,861 --> 01:37:21,361
<i>Incoming call: Hae-seong</i>

1509
01:37:23,027 --> 01:37:25,694
- Yeah.
- <i>Park Jin-hyeok, where are you?</i>

1510
01:37:27,277 --> 01:37:29,111
Come to school, moron.

1511
01:37:37,736 --> 01:37:39,236
This is your last chance.

1512
01:37:41,444 --> 01:37:42,902
Get the job done.

1513
01:37:58,652 --> 01:37:59,944
Hae-seong.

1514
01:38:02,777 --> 01:38:03,944
Hae-seong.

1515
01:38:04,027 --> 01:38:05,944
Answer the phone, Park Jin-hyeok.

1516
01:38:06,277 --> 01:38:08,527
- Hae-seong.
- Park Jin-hyeok...

1517
01:38:08,611 --> 01:38:09,861
Hey!

1518
01:38:10,861 --> 01:38:12,652
We need to go now.

1519
01:38:20,319 --> 01:38:22,069
Joo Hae-seong, where are you going?

1520
01:38:23,902 --> 01:38:24,986
Where's Chae-young?

1521
01:38:49,694 --> 01:38:50,777
What is this?

1522
01:38:51,527 --> 01:38:53,111
Are you here to fight me?

1523
01:38:53,777 --> 01:38:54,819
Where's Chae-young?

1524
01:38:54,902 --> 01:38:57,819
You shouldn't have made things so complicated.

1525
01:38:57,902 --> 01:38:59,277
Where's Chae-young?

1526
01:39:01,861 --> 01:39:03,111
Hey, scumbags.

1527
01:39:03,194 --> 01:39:05,319
Nobody leaves here without my permission.

1528
01:39:05,402 --> 01:39:07,861
Hey, take them down.

1529
01:39:31,444 --> 01:39:32,819
What the hell are you doing?

1530
01:39:32,902 --> 01:39:35,069
Are you taking turns? Just go at him!

1531
01:40:07,861 --> 01:40:10,111
Hell, get up!

1532
01:40:21,236 --> 01:40:22,569
Hey!

1533
01:40:48,986 --> 01:40:50,361
Get him!

1534
01:40:50,777 --> 01:40:51,819
Friggin' schmuck!

1535
01:41:09,736 --> 01:41:10,986
Hell!

1536
01:41:52,736 --> 01:41:56,027
- What's this?
- This is karate!

1537
01:42:15,527 --> 01:42:19,069
Hell... stay still!

1538
01:42:26,152 --> 01:42:29,027
Sorry about that but I told you to stay still.

1539
01:42:39,777 --> 01:42:41,277
Stay still.

1540
01:42:44,652 --> 01:42:46,194
Stay still.

1541
01:42:46,611 --> 01:42:47,986
Just stay still.

1542
01:42:56,777 --> 01:42:59,611
Chae-young! Chae-young!

1543
01:42:59,694 --> 01:43:02,486
- It's locked!
- Park Jin-hyeok!

1544
01:43:04,361 --> 01:43:06,736
Baek Gang-shik, that bloody moron.

1545
01:43:14,569 --> 01:43:17,861
Park Jin-hyeok, you call yourself a human?

1546
01:43:17,944 --> 01:43:19,069
Call the police.

1547
01:43:19,152 --> 01:43:21,819
You want to see her face get shredded?

1548
01:43:22,277 --> 01:43:23,569
Put the phone down.

1549
01:43:25,736 --> 01:43:27,902
You think I'm bloody kidding?

1550
01:43:27,986 --> 01:43:30,194
I said, put it down.

1551
01:43:36,736 --> 01:43:38,069
Put it down.

1552
01:43:38,569 --> 01:43:41,236
Come here for a second. A little closer.

1553
01:43:42,486 --> 01:43:43,736
Come on.

1554
01:43:47,319 --> 01:43:48,486
Kneel.

1555
01:43:50,986 --> 01:43:52,444
I said, kneel!

1556
01:44:03,277 --> 01:44:05,694
Why did you do this to me?

1557
01:44:06,652 --> 01:44:08,319
Why the hell did you do this to me?

1558
01:44:08,402 --> 01:44:09,986
Do I look like a pushover?

1559
01:44:10,069 --> 01:44:12,819
Do I look like a pushover, you piece of crap?

1560
01:44:13,736 --> 01:44:16,111
You scumbag! Friggin' loser!

1561
01:44:16,194 --> 01:44:19,944
Do I look like a pushover, you scumbag?

1562
01:44:20,944 --> 01:44:24,111
This is all your fault, you hear me?

1563
01:44:28,361 --> 01:44:30,486
Hell, you have a death wish?

1564
01:44:31,861 --> 01:44:33,194
Bloody hell!

1565
01:44:39,152 --> 01:44:41,444
Scumbag!

1566
01:45:01,819 --> 01:45:04,944
Everyone has been disrespecting me.

1567
01:45:06,319 --> 01:45:08,486
I'll show you who I am today.

1568
01:45:08,569 --> 01:45:10,569
You lowlife rat.

1569
01:45:11,111 --> 01:45:12,944
I know who you are.

1570
01:45:14,361 --> 01:45:15,611
You're a hypocrite.

1571
01:45:20,069 --> 01:45:21,611
Are you deaf?

1572
01:45:21,694 --> 01:45:23,694
You shouldn't even have been born

1573
01:45:23,777 --> 01:45:25,319
you lowlife trash!

1574
01:45:26,611 --> 01:45:28,819
You friggin' schmuck!

1575
01:45:30,736 --> 01:45:34,444
Who are you to diss me?

1576
01:45:34,527 --> 01:45:35,861
You friggin' schmuck!

1577
01:45:41,902 --> 01:45:43,736
Friggin' loser!

1578
01:45:51,902 --> 01:45:54,861
Die, you piece of crap!

1579
01:46:02,777 --> 01:46:04,652
I'm Park Jin-hyeok.

1580
01:46:07,194 --> 01:46:09,694
Hell, I said I'm Park Jin-hyeok.

1581
01:46:18,527 --> 01:46:20,152
Bloody hell...

1582
01:46:23,444 --> 01:46:25,652
Go to hell!

1583
01:46:44,569 --> 01:46:46,652
My dad always said...

1584
01:46:47,694 --> 01:46:49,902
You crazy witch.

1585
01:46:53,319 --> 01:46:55,444
"Justice without power is hollow."

1586
01:46:59,777 --> 01:47:02,236
"But power without justice is merely violence."

1587
01:47:02,819 --> 01:47:05,652
You deserve this beating.

1588
01:47:05,902 --> 01:47:08,027
Go to hell.

1589
01:48:03,569 --> 01:48:06,444
Hey, Chae-young...

1590
01:48:08,027 --> 01:48:09,486
Are you OK?

1591
01:48:10,444 --> 01:48:12,152
I should be the one asking you that.

1592
01:48:12,236 --> 01:48:14,736
I'll take care of you.

1593
01:48:14,819 --> 01:48:17,111
Guys... are you OK?

1594
01:48:17,194 --> 01:48:19,611
Wait. Wait a minute.

1595
01:48:19,694 --> 01:48:21,194
Hae-seong.

1596
01:48:21,902 --> 01:48:23,486
Get up.

1597
01:48:27,527 --> 01:48:30,694
- My leg.
- Easy, easy...

1598
01:48:30,986 --> 01:48:32,736
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1599
01:48:32,819 --> 01:48:35,652
You were out for a while. Are you all right?

1600
01:48:37,277 --> 01:48:39,361
Just worry about yourselves.

1601
01:48:39,444 --> 01:48:41,986
Jong-gu, are you all right?

1602
01:48:42,069 --> 01:48:43,319
Are you OK?

1603
01:48:44,027 --> 01:48:45,486
Let's go.

1604
01:48:45,902 --> 01:48:47,861
Let's go, Chae-young.

1605
01:48:49,611 --> 01:48:51,069
Just go.

1606
01:48:52,277 --> 01:48:54,986
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, what about you?

1607
01:48:55,069 --> 01:48:59,027
- Are you guys hungry?
- A little bit.

1608
01:49:03,402 --> 01:49:06,777
Hae-seong, could I get your number?

1609
01:49:06,861 --> 01:49:08,736
I couldn't call you earlier.

1610
01:49:08,819 --> 01:49:10,652
You don't know my number?

1611
01:49:11,402 --> 01:49:13,444
- Why not?
- That's why I couldn't call you.

1612
01:49:13,527 --> 01:49:15,569
<i>Incoming call: Gangbuk's Kim Sang-jin</i>

1613
01:49:15,652 --> 01:49:17,527
Then, could I get Chae-young's number?

1614
01:49:17,611 --> 01:49:19,069
Is he dumb?

1615
01:49:19,527 --> 01:49:22,152
It's true. Master is divorced and single.

1616
01:49:22,236 --> 01:49:23,361
- Really?
- Yeah.

1617
01:49:23,444 --> 01:49:24,694
I think she's right.

1618
01:49:24,777 --> 01:49:26,152
He goes shopping alone every day.

1619
01:49:26,236 --> 01:49:29,569
Really? He's totally my type.

1620
01:49:29,652 --> 01:49:30,819
Your type?

1621
01:49:30,902 --> 01:49:33,111
He's so much older than you!

1622
01:49:33,194 --> 01:49:35,152
That's not good.

1623
01:49:35,236 --> 01:49:36,986
You can't say that anymore.

1624
01:49:37,069 --> 01:49:40,527
Age shouldn't matter.

1625
01:49:40,611 --> 01:49:41,652
What?

1626
01:49:41,736 --> 01:49:43,402
"Justice without power is hollow."

1627
01:49:43,486 --> 01:49:44,527
"But power without justice"

1628
01:49:44,611 --> 01:49:45,652
"is merely violence."

1629
01:49:45,736 --> 01:49:47,569
Master Choi Bae-dal said that.

1630
01:49:47,652 --> 01:49:50,361
In karate, what's most important

1631
01:49:50,444 --> 01:49:52,111
is to dominate

1632
01:49:52,194 --> 01:49:53,444
not to attack.

1633
01:49:53,819 --> 01:49:56,069
Karate is not a skill to attack someone

1634
01:49:56,402 --> 01:49:57,652
but rather, to dominate your opponent

1635
01:49:57,736 --> 01:50:00,611
with your bare hands to protect yourself.

1636
01:50:07,694 --> 01:50:10,194
Now ladies, learning karate

1637
01:50:10,277 --> 01:50:11,361
will help you lose weight fast.

1638
01:50:11,444 --> 01:50:12,861
Let's warm up first

1639
01:50:12,944 --> 01:50:14,194
with a simple dance.

1640
01:50:14,277 --> 01:50:15,527
OK.

1641
01:50:20,694 --> 01:50:21,944
<i>Osu!</i>

1642
01:50:45,694 --> 01:50:47,111
