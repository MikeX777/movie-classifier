1
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:31,013
Look Beautiful and Shut Up

2
00:02:57,755 --> 00:02:59,943
Disappear for an hour or two
before going to Raphael's.

3
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,848
I'll go to the movies, boss.
I hear there's a good police film.

4
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,591
Perfect. I'll go to Maxim's.
- OK, at Maxim's.

5
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,342
Who did it?
- We don't know. - Of course.

6
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:35,928
Inspector Morel has an idea.
- That's more like it.

7
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,354
He thinks it's "Charlemagne".
- Quick! Call the paper!

8
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:39,674
Who's Charlemagne?

9
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:41,878
If we knew, we wouldn't
call him Charlemagne!

10
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:45,495
"Charlemagne returns:
50 million in emeralds stolen"

11
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:56,718
You can't stand there, sir.
It's forbidden by the police.

12
00:03:59,245 --> 00:04:00,455
Who are you after?

13
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,365
What did she do?
- Silly things.

14
00:04:11,436 --> 00:04:13,154
Like what?
- Two escapes.

15
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:16,393
From jail?
- No, the "Bon Pasteur".

16
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:19,756
The Bon Pasteur?
- It's a reformatory.

17
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:22,685
Too bad. Such a sweet girl.

18
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:24,377
Yes, she's an orphan and a minor.

19
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:26,775
She's been sent to the orphanage
but she won't stay there.

20
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:28,622
That led her to the reformatory...

21
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:31,712
But this time she's headed for Doulens.

22
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,925
Doulens?
- Yes, the prison.

23
00:04:50,342 --> 00:04:53,111
Virginie Dumaillet?
- Yes? - Police.

24
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:58,395
I should have known with your ugly mug!

25
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:02,168
Can I get dressed?
- Yes, I'll take you to the Bon Pasteur.

26
00:05:26,063 --> 00:05:28,531
You're lucky we still have an empty bed.

27
00:05:29,106 --> 00:05:31,625
Otherwise you'd sleep in the dungeon.

28
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:33,707
It's not nice to lie, Sister

29
00:05:33,786 --> 00:05:36,505
Get in bed. Be quiet.

30
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:41,865
In bed!

31
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:45,548
What's wrong?

32
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:48,170
Oh! The sheets are cold!

33
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:52,267
You've become too fussy.
Try to sleep.

34
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,774
You're facing the judge tomorrow.
I wish you good luck.

35
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:57,231
Thank you, Sister.

36
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:05,548
Sister!

37
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:07,962
You're not going to kiss me?

38
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:15,306
You don't deserve it.

39
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:32,048
What is all this?

40
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:34,685
You plan to escape?
- Yes!

41
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:36,224
You're crazy!

42
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:39,685
Sheets are dangerous!
They come apart too easily.

43
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:41,575
Like that!

44
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:44,631
You'll kill yourself.
- I have to get away.

45
00:06:46,224 --> 00:06:48,369
It's much easier with keys.

46
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,834
Oh! How did you do that?

47
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:52,779
It was nothing!
10 years of practice.

48
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:55,709
Can we escape together?

49
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:58,224
Wait! I just arrived.

50
00:06:59,243 --> 00:07:01,462
And I don't know where to go now.
- I do.

51
00:07:02,142 --> 00:07:03,532
I have friends waiting for me.

52
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,938
Then we have a deal.
Get me out of here and I'll hide you.

53
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:10,102
Agreed.

54
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:12,672
I'm Olga.
- Virginie.

55
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:16,274
When do we leave?
- At 11 PM... after their rounds.

56
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,703
Hey...

57
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,648
Who are your friends?
- Serious guys.

58
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:30,555
What do they do?
- They travel.

59
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:33,469
They'll take me abroad.
- You think they can take me too?

60
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,368
I can't work in a French circus now.

61
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,422
I'll ask Loulou.
- Who's Loulou? - The big boss.

62
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,365
He's my boyfriend.
- You have a boyfriend?

63
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:45,398
Why... don't you?

64
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,390
No... not yet.

65
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,218
Open! It's Gino.

66
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:23,165
Well?

67
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:26,961
You've seen the papers?
- Already?

68
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:30,673
Special edition.
- It's always a pleasure.

69
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:31,977
Here!

70
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:35,539
Shit! Charlemagne!
They know it's the boss!

71
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:39,247
Not a big deal since no one knows
who Charlemagne is, not even me.

72
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:44,935
Not bad, eh?

73
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:48,033
That's too nice!
- Meaning what?

74
00:08:48,103 --> 00:08:49,173
Difficult to sell.

75
00:08:49,243 --> 00:08:51,200
But you have to hurry.
The boss can't wait.

76
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:54,716
OK but this time I take 40 percent.

77
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,497
Watch it, Mr. Raphael.
My boss is dangerous.

78
00:08:58,107 --> 00:08:59,123
Me too.

79
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,567
So what do you want to do?
Do I handle the stones?

80
00:09:03,638 --> 00:09:05,548
It's not for me to say.
Do it the usual way.

81
00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:07,325
I'll ask the boss about your percentage.

82
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:09,724
OK. Let's take stock.

83
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:38,208
Throw me a fag [cibiche]!

84
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,560
This isn't 1935!
You can't say "cibiche"!

85
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:41,935
You have to say "Gimme a smoke!"

86
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:44,097
I'll write it down!
- Forget it, she's too dumb!

87
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:46,382
Loulou! Telephone!
- In the booth.

88
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,950
I want to play.
But I have no money.

89
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,131
Oh! Twenty francs now!

90
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,185
Wait! Wait!

91
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,638
Pierrot!

92
00:09:55,602 --> 00:09:57,688
Olga has escaped!

93
00:09:58,476 --> 00:09:59,901
Go on sweetie!

94
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:01,524
I'm not alone.

95
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:04,872
I promised my friend that we'd hide her.
She got me out.

96
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:07,293
We'll help her.
But keep quiet about our business.

97
00:10:07,364 --> 00:10:08,425
We'll pick you up.

98
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:10,520
On a scooter?
Out of the question!

99
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,111
The cops will spot us
at the first corner!

100
00:10:13,354 --> 00:10:14,495
Get a car!

101
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:16,831
A car?
You're crazy, I don't have one.

102
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:18,251
Madame wants a limo service!

103
00:10:18,322 --> 00:10:20,503
We could "borrow" Raphael's car
for an hour.

104
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:22,924
He owes us big time.
- Right!

105
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:25,534
Don't move. I'll cross the sound barrier
and be there now.

106
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,836
I'll be back in a minute!
- Olga is out!

107
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:32,586
Geez! - Don't say "Geez", say...
- Shit!

108
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:05,661
Oh, my Loulou!

109
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,733
This Virginie.
- There's no time. Hurry!

110
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:14,592
Let's all sit in the front!

111
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,585
There! You've got guts, Mister!

112
00:11:28,656 --> 00:11:30,312
No "Mister" between friends.

113
00:11:33,888 --> 00:11:36,396
I'll buy you a drink.
You deserve it.

114
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:42,747
It can't be! It's been stolen!

115
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,318
What? My car?
- Yes.

116
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:48,529
Where did you leave it?
- Here, as usual.

117
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:49,966
You left the keys on the board?

118
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:52,240
I thought that in a yard... Oh shit!

119
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:55,544
Is that all?
- No, the weapons are in it!

120
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:59,271
Weapons from the robbery?
- Yes, it's a disaster!

121
00:12:01,881 --> 00:12:02,888
I'll take care of it.

122
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:06,123
I'll report it to the police.

123
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:11,623
Don't worry, they'll believe me.
I'll say it happened before 7 PM.

124
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:15,763
I wouldn't want to be
in the shoes of that thief!

125
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:27,920
I think we're done for.
- We won't even spend a night together.

126
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:35,934
Let's not all get caught.
Stop the car.

127
00:12:36,184 --> 00:12:38,129
You two get out.
I'll lead them away.

128
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,434
She's right. I don't want
to see the coppers now.

129
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:42,613
Thanks, Virginie.
I'll repay you for this.

130
00:12:46,658 --> 00:12:48,162
Change places!

131
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,158
See you later if you make it!

132
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:14,797
Are you crazy?

133
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,364
Isn't this our meeting place?

134
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:18,692
This is no time for joking!
Show me your papers!

135
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:21,426
I don't have any.
- No papers? A driver's license?

136
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:24,802
Look, a machine gun!
That's a new one!

137
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:26,168
You think it's a real one?

138
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,302
For sure.
Come on, I'll explain it to you.

139
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,807
[Police] Let's go!
[Virginie] Hey, there's no reason to...

140
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:49,966
Where's Morel?

141
00:13:50,294 --> 00:13:52,301
I don't know, boss.
- He's never here!

142
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:54,880
That's his method:
elusive as a phantom and...

143
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:57,160
fast as a Jaguar!

144
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:59,419
Yes, but Jaguar or not,
you must find him immediately!

145
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,583
He has to go to the
Kremlin-Bicetre precinct now.

146
00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:04,887
We found a stolen car
with a machine gun and a 7.65.

147
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,520
The weapons from the robbery.
Here's the report. Go now.

148
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:10,489
Boss! Who was the driver?

149
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,770
An 18 year old girl!

150
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:16,484
(intentional gibberish)

151
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:17,867
Of course you don't give a damn.

152
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:20,125
Eighteen! Another genius!

153
00:14:24,172 --> 00:14:25,235
Perfect.

154
00:14:28,352 --> 00:14:29,461
Something is wrong here.

155
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:30,758
Very good! Thank you, Sister.

156
00:14:32,031 --> 00:14:35,406
So two of you girls fled from
the Bon Pasteur. - That's right.

157
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:36,492
Why didn't you say so?

158
00:14:36,563 --> 00:14:38,758
It's your job to find out.
That's what you're paid for.

159
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:40,591
Inspector Morel is here, Commissioner.

160
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:42,063
Good, I'll see him in a moment.

161
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:49,382
The Commissioner will see you right away.

162
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:51,491
Take a seat there.

163
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:15,077
What did you do?

164
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:18,258
I'm innocent.

165
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:22,116
Come on, I'm not a snitch.

166
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:26,046
Robbery?
- No.

167
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:30,562
They intend to keep you?
- Yes.

168
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:32,257
How long?

169
00:15:32,937 --> 00:15:35,952
Barring anything unexpected...
about 30 years.

170
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:43,351
Let's go now.
- What?

171
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:47,000
Too risky.
- Child's play.

172
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:49,023
The Commissioner's ready.
- OK.

173
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:50,914
Come on, now.

174
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:54,234
Too bad.
We'll do it another time.

175
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:56,382
I said now!
- Alright.

176
00:15:58,031 --> 00:15:59,265
What's the rush?

177
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:03,304
And you. In the cage.

178
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,420
You know Inspector Jean Morel?

179
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:14,222
Not yet, but I've
heard a lot about you.

180
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,347
Commissioner, you're too kind.

181
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:19,526
I'll show you the report.

182
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,319
That's all she confessed to me.

183
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:24,448
I wish you good luck with her.

184
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:29,251
Will I have to spend the night here?
- Probably yes.

185
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:35,076
Oh.
- Yes. - Yes.

186
00:16:37,694 --> 00:16:40,889
With your permission, Commissioner,
I'd like to try an experiment.

187
00:16:41,184 --> 00:16:43,309
Ah! You have an idea?
- Yes, an idea.

188
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,878
Are you sure it's a good idea?

189
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:47,583
Yes, I believe this girl
could lead us very far. Listen.

190
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:50,473
Say, could you play the bad cop?

191
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:52,848
Yes.

192
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,708
What are you doing?

193
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:58,458
Getting ready for the night!

194
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:03,169
Let's go!

195
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:05,215
Come on, punk!
- That's enough!

196
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:08,387
Who do you think you are?
He wants a lawyer!

197
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:09,634
Who do you think you are?

198
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:11,772
We'll make you talk, you little bastard!

199
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:13,515
Shithead! You'll see...

200
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:14,992
It's a trick we're using.

201
00:17:15,063 --> 00:17:18,656
We're going to have fun with you,
you bastard!

202
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:20,141
Watch what you say!

203
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:23,071
Give me a cigarette.

204
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,711
Now you want to smoke!

205
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:26,836
Prisoners don't smoke here!

206
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:27,945
Go away now.

207
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:30,383
Good! Stay here and don't move!

208
00:17:30,454 --> 00:17:34,187
You see how I treated him?
With strength and authority.

209
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:37,313
Come over here.

210
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,727
Take my cigarettes.

211
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:45,195
What are you waiting for?

212
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:48,742
In my pocket.

213
00:18:04,102 --> 00:18:06,413
If you keep on provoking him,
you'll get him really mad.

214
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:07,507
Don't worry...

215
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,992
I prefer women
who obey without talking.

216
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:15,280
What? You're smoking?

217
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,655
I'll make you regret you were born!

218
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:20,029
Let's go, asshole!
- What did you say?

219
00:18:20,396 --> 00:18:21,974
I just said...

220
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:23,138
You said "asshole".

221
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:25,623
Me? I said "asshole"?

222
00:18:27,097 --> 00:18:29,121
Of course I could have said
"carrot" or "teapot"...

223
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,946
but I said "asshole"?

224
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:33,082
Yes... too bad you said "asshole".

225
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:36,268
I'll remember.
I never forget friends... or enemies.

226
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:37,909
I'll get you for that!

227
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,923
Let's go! I'll teach you!

228
00:18:41,994 --> 00:18:44,337
Threatening the police now!

229
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:50,634
Just my luck!

230
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,735
I've waited 18 years to fall in love...

231
00:18:53,806 --> 00:18:54,915
and when it happens...

232
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:58,954
I have to wait 30 more to know
if he's the right man for me!

233
00:19:18,717 --> 00:19:21,038
To resume... you don't like the police?

234
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:23,232
They make me puke.
- Ah, yes.

235
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,389
There are nice policemen, though.
- Hmm!

236
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,810
Hmph!... Don't make me laugh!
- You're wrong.

237
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:32,791
Some are really nice sometimes.

238
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,350
You know, I could help you a great deal.

239
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:41,873
Huh... yes!

240
00:19:42,694 --> 00:19:44,397
In another life, maybe.

241
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:46,467
It's not my day...

242
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:55,881
Here's your big chance.

243
00:19:55,952 --> 00:19:57,936
I shut my eyes...
and you run away.

244
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,202
Ah! One couldn't ask for more!

245
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,357
You don't want to escape?
- No, don't bother.

246
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:11,115
It's the first time
someone refuses to escape!

247
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:14,342
You think I don't know your plan?

248
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:17,467
You want to book me
for trying to escape!

249
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,365
I want you to escape!
- No!

250
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:21,091
You'll do it now!
- No! No, no!

251
00:20:21,162 --> 00:20:22,432
No, no! Go, go!
- No!

252
00:20:22,502 --> 00:20:24,678
Go, go! - No!
- You need to go now!

253
00:20:33,997 --> 00:20:35,176
She ran away?

254
00:20:37,911 --> 00:20:40,153
I don't understand. She was here...

255
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:42,184
She escaped! Run after her!

256
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:44,762
Let's go! Quick!

257
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,674
They must be on the boulevard!

258
00:21:14,135 --> 00:21:17,932
The Palace of Miracles tour...
starts in a few minutes.

259
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,768
A free tour.
The only one in the world.

260
00:21:21,987 --> 00:21:24,604
On the first floor, the Palace of Miracles!

261
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:38,737
Don't ask anything.

262
00:21:39,268 --> 00:21:40,874
I bribed that cop...

263
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:43,299
the inspector you saw yesterday evening.

264
00:21:43,964 --> 00:21:46,510
I paid for both of us.

265
00:21:47,534 --> 00:21:49,807
Those pigs are all corrupt!

266
00:21:49,878 --> 00:21:51,303
Don't believe it.

267
00:21:51,373 --> 00:21:54,073
It's rather unusual.
This one is scared of me.

268
00:21:55,323 --> 00:21:59,174
How much does a cop cost?
I might need to know one day.

269
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,362
Let's not discuss it.

270
00:22:02,463 --> 00:22:04,479
Because... it was a gift.

271
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:11,806
So you left your keys in the car
with the doors unlocked?

272
00:22:12,316 --> 00:22:16,019
In my yard, Inspector.
Nothing ever happened before.

273
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,308
You think you're right and you're not!

274
00:22:20,043 --> 00:22:22,550
Can I get my car back, Inspector?

275
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:24,566
I need it for work.

276
00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:26,136
I'm a modest photographer.

277
00:22:26,465 --> 00:22:28,230
Yeah, yeah, we'll give it back to you.

278
00:22:28,386 --> 00:22:30,886
You left your handgun in it, by the way.

279
00:22:31,402 --> 00:22:33,441
My gun?
- And your machine gun.

280
00:22:33,512 --> 00:22:35,746
In case you were looking for them!

281
00:22:36,066 --> 00:22:39,066
But I've never had
any weapons, Inspector!

282
00:22:39,144 --> 00:22:41,685
So why did we find them
on the back seat? Why?

283
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:43,183
Of your car! Why?

284
00:22:43,564 --> 00:22:45,611
I don't know, Inspector!

285
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:49,632
I'm a humble taxpayer...
whose car was stolen!

286
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:53,023
My mother will die of shame!

287
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:58,499
No, no, no. Don't worry.
I know you had nothing to do with it.

288
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:01,765
I know you suspect me.

289
00:23:04,155 --> 00:23:07,023
You're an honest man... I can tell.

290
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,753
The only one who ever really...

291
00:23:24,823 --> 00:23:26,503
helped or understood me...

292
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:27,686
That's you.

293
00:23:33,248 --> 00:23:34,857
You don't like to be thanked.

294
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:06,459
I think you're hiding something.

295
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,005
You escape with a girl but don't
know where she lives. - I love you!

296
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:14,310
You save a young crook
but don't know who he is.

297
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:17,321
You talk about meeting them
but don't know where.

298
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,582
It doesn't make sense.

299
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,050
I can't trust you, Virginie, if you lie.

300
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:28,321
Yes.

301
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:31,134
Does Loulou really exist?
- Of course.

302
00:24:31,462 --> 00:24:33,259
I'll make a call to find him.

303
00:24:33,392 --> 00:24:34,587
Telephone from here?

304
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:36,251
The place is deserted now.

305
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:39,537
I'll be back in 5 minutes.
You'll have time to think.

306
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,318
What do you mean?

307
00:24:41,935 --> 00:24:43,303
I'm not a kid, you know.

308
00:24:44,037 --> 00:24:46,435
Don't try to get me going.
That won't work on me.

309
00:24:47,365 --> 00:24:49,701
No pretense between us
or I'll dump you.

310
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:51,044
It's your decision.

311
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,630
Whatever happens, stay right here.

312
00:25:06,786 --> 00:25:07,903
Hello!

313
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:10,176
I was starting to worry about you.
What?

314
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:12,380
Tell me... Loulou!

315
00:25:12,451 --> 00:25:16,120
Yes... Loulou. Wait, I'll write it down.

316
00:25:16,452 --> 00:25:17,616
Loulou...

317
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:19,526
Around twenty...

318
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:20,748
No, I have no idea.

319
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:24,906
And you know I have a great memory...
even if you don't agree with me!

320
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,172
That's all you got from her?

321
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:29,315
After all I've done!

322
00:25:29,386 --> 00:25:30,697
I think she's telling the truth.

323
00:25:30,768 --> 00:25:33,073
She's not part of the
band... or she's very clever.

324
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,448
I'll shake her a bit.

325
00:25:35,613 --> 00:25:37,808
If she doesn't talk now,
she never will.

326
00:25:38,714 --> 00:25:41,089
It won't be long now.
That's it.

327
00:25:57,115 --> 00:25:58,310
What's wrong?

328
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,512
I'm playing the game.
Isn't this what you wanted?

329
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:06,544
Yes... but maybe you read
too much into my thoughts.

330
00:26:07,256 --> 00:26:09,858
No pretense between us.
That's what you said.

331
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,819
Yes, yes. Of course.

332
00:26:13,842 --> 00:26:16,849
You like to be obeyed, right.
- Naturally, yes.

333
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:20,280
A man like you could have any woman...

334
00:26:21,061 --> 00:26:24,139
not waste time on some kid
who wanted to escape unless...

335
00:26:25,155 --> 00:26:26,983
you have a good reason.

336
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:29,873
What reason?
- That's the point. I don't see.

337
00:26:30,942 --> 00:26:33,004
So there's just one explanation:

338
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:35,583
That you really love me.

339
00:26:37,926 --> 00:26:39,442
Swear that you don't like me at all.

340
00:26:41,676 --> 00:26:43,153
You can't swear it?

341
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,051
No.

342
00:26:46,306 --> 00:26:49,369
You see... I was right to trust you.

343
00:26:50,557 --> 00:26:52,283
I waited for the man I would love.

344
00:26:52,572 --> 00:26:54,260
How I dreamed of him.

345
00:26:54,494 --> 00:26:55,772
And how I feared...

346
00:26:56,306 --> 00:26:58,720
finding a woman who'd
make me lose my head.

347
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:00,494
And you found her?

348
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:02,033
Yes, I'm afraid so.

349
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,516
She came at the most unexpected time.

350
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:08,244
It's a bad start.

351
00:27:08,685 --> 00:27:11,185
Yes... worse than you think.

352
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:39,614
Get dressed.

353
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:42,676
Get dressed, I said!

354
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:43,762
Why?

355
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:45,489
We're leaving.
- The museum's closed.

356
00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:46,935
That doesn't matter.

357
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:00,437
What are we doing?

358
00:28:01,477 --> 00:28:02,891
We're going to jail.

359
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:04,383
That's not funny.

360
00:28:10,414 --> 00:28:11,734
You should be ashamed.

361
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,281
More than you think.

362
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:20,156
Whether or not you believe it...

363
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:22,749
even though I'm taking you there,

364
00:28:23,062 --> 00:28:25,000
I'll do whatever I can to get you out.

365
00:28:26,711 --> 00:28:28,031
OK, let's go.

366
00:28:28,469 --> 00:28:30,000
Hands up!

367
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,833
This is a mistake. We're not thieves.

368
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,036
I'm Police Inspector Jean Morel.

369
00:28:36,137 --> 00:28:39,328
Disgusting! An inspector with a woman
in the Du Barry's room.

370
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:41,585
No stupid comments, please!

371
00:28:41,656 --> 00:28:43,647
Don't try to shut me up!
- Yeah, yeah.

372
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:45,483
This is a temple of history here...

373
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:47,272
not a hotel.

374
00:29:12,032 --> 00:29:13,867
Olga's address.
- Can't you be careful!

375
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,610
Sorry, I slipped.

376
00:29:16,016 --> 00:29:17,758
Nothing broken?
- No, thank you.

377
00:29:32,695 --> 00:29:35,351
In a room of the Grevin Museum!
- That's a lie!

378
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,351
You believe what the girl told you?

379
00:29:38,422 --> 00:29:42,568
No, but the museum guard
said the same thing!

380
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:43,768
I told you it's a lie!

381
00:29:43,838 --> 00:29:46,288
He wants to file a complaint

382
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,492
and write to his deputy!
He's a war hero.!

383
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:50,163
That whole story's nonsense.

384
00:29:50,234 --> 00:29:52,835
But if the press speaks,
one must stand up to it.

385
00:29:52,906 --> 00:29:54,254
What do you mean "if the press"?

386
00:29:54,324 --> 00:29:57,135
By tonight it will be in all the papers!

387
00:29:57,221 --> 00:30:00,822
Perfect... in that case, I resign.
- Me too.

388
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,451
That won't stop the scandal.

389
00:30:03,522 --> 00:30:05,771
Our reputation is bad enough already.

390
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:08,881
We help minors escape
and seduce them in museums...

391
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,670
the scandal will ruin us all!

392
00:30:10,756 --> 00:30:12,700
The prefect, me, you,
we'll all have to resign.

393
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:14,424
The little bitch is really mad at us!

394
00:30:14,495 --> 00:30:16,138
After what I did to her,
I can understand.

395
00:30:16,209 --> 00:30:17,795
You admit it?
- No!

396
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:19,303
But she's a good girl.

397
00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:20,991
I was wrong to trick her.

398
00:30:21,162 --> 00:30:22,553
Now he's on her side!

399
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:24,194
We should have
left her in the circus!

400
00:30:24,265 --> 00:30:25,396
She doesn't belong in jail!

401
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:26,966
It's you who belong in jail!

402
00:30:27,037 --> 00:30:30,373
She was arrested driving a car
with the robbery weapons!

403
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,289
She wasn't involved in that case.

404
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,742
She'll still go to prison!

405
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:36,273
And we'll all be out of a job!

406
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:39,336
At my age!
After all I've done for you!

407
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:42,320
I put you here!
You and your smart ideas!

408
00:30:42,438 --> 00:30:45,501
You better find one now, Mr. Morel,
to get us out of this mess!

409
00:30:55,524 --> 00:30:57,735
I have one.
So tell us, Morel!

410
00:30:57,813 --> 00:30:59,782
I have four kids to feed!

411
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:01,078
I'll marry her.

412
00:31:02,688 --> 00:31:04,235
And then?
- What?

413
00:31:04,368 --> 00:31:06,805
The juvenile court doesn't deal
with married women.

414
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:07,949
And the museum?

415
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:12,156
Lovers don't look at clocks...
whether in the museum or the woods.

416
00:31:13,594 --> 00:31:14,829
You think he's joking?

417
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,586
No, his ear didn't move.

418
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:20,850
Morel, just one word: thank you.

419
00:31:20,928 --> 00:31:22,305
Pardon me!

420
00:31:23,024 --> 00:31:25,172
Wait, wait. She hasn't agreed yet.

421
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:26,555
I'll take care of that.

422
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:27,629
Where is she?

423
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,746
I summoned her.
She's waiting in Room B.

424
00:31:30,813 --> 00:31:32,188
Wait next door.

425
00:31:32,814 --> 00:31:34,657
Send in Virginie Dumaillet.

426
00:31:39,321 --> 00:31:41,094
It's time to beat me up?

427
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:45,329
Come in.

428
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:52,117
Sit down, kid.

429
00:31:56,469 --> 00:31:58,492
So you don't like jail, eh?

430
00:31:58,914 --> 00:32:00,063
I'd like to see you there!

431
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:02,398
That's true. It was a dumb question.

432
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:05,188
You said it.
- I've had enough, OK?!

433
00:32:07,054 --> 00:32:09,844
Sorry I yelled. Force of habit.

434
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:12,750
I want to show you that policemen
aren't that bad...

435
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,266
and sometimes even conscientious.

436
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:16,008
No pep talk, please!

437
00:32:17,842 --> 00:32:20,797
OK... in order to save you from prison...

438
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:23,295
an inspector wants to marry you.

439
00:32:23,577 --> 00:32:26,561
He's crazy!
- Yes! No, not at all.

440
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,694
I understand your surprise
and the joy you feel.

441
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,530
You're lucky.
He's very handsome.

442
00:32:32,608 --> 00:32:34,663
And you know him...
Inspector Jean Morel.

443
00:32:35,397 --> 00:32:36,780
Marry him? Never!

444
00:32:37,381 --> 00:32:38,631
You don't want to marry him?

445
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:40,568
No, I want to send him to jail.

446
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,874
And he wants you to avoid jail!

447
00:32:43,452 --> 00:32:44,935
Good, then I won't meet him there.

448
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,303
You will please accept him!

449
00:32:49,981 --> 00:32:51,442
Jerome, stop pacing like that.

450
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:53,591
I can't stand waiting.
I'll go get the news.

451
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:54,962
I'm going.

452
00:32:56,728 --> 00:32:58,259
Why does he want to marry me?

453
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,312
I told you. To save you from prison.

454
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:02,695
He's ashamed of his behavior.
He wants to help you.

455
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:04,476
That's all?
- That's all.

456
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:07,789
So he doesn't like me!
- Yes he does! A lot!

457
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:09,507
So... it's yes?

458
00:33:09,718 --> 00:33:12,103
No! I can't marry a cop!

459
00:33:12,174 --> 00:33:13,744
It doesn't fit with my sense of honor.

460
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:16,853
Too bad for you!
You can spend your life in jail!

461
00:33:19,516 --> 00:33:21,899
And if I marry him?
I go back to jail?

462
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:25,054
No! You'll be free.
I'll sign your release immediately!

463
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,585
Really... that changes everything.

464
00:33:29,203 --> 00:33:31,382
Tell your cop that I've made up my mind.

465
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,922
I accept his proposition.
- Bravo!

466
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,499
Until you get married,
put her with someone you trust...

467
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,827
Your grandma, for example.

468
00:33:49,921 --> 00:33:51,902
Yes, my grandma, sure.
What shall I tell her?

469
00:33:51,972 --> 00:33:53,499
That she just left the convent.

470
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:55,056
Olga Babitcheff
Bar le Zenith

471
00:33:55,127 --> 00:33:56,923
Rue de la Gaite [Montparnasse]
Paris

472
00:34:12,255 --> 00:34:14,317
I want you to know...

473
00:34:14,403 --> 00:34:16,762
That I'm not just doing this
to help you.

474
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:19,458
Let me be the first to congratulate
the future couple!

475
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:21,559
Can I kiss the fiancee?
- No. - No, OK.

476
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,919
Thank you for your enthusiasm.

477
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,332
Anything for the mail?
- No.

478
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:29,051
Be careful!
- I must have slipped.

479
00:34:29,122 --> 00:34:34,083
Thanks a lot. Don't bother. Thank you.

480
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,801
OK... thank you.

481
00:34:40,771 --> 00:34:43,099
Here's the plan:
we'll marry in 2 weeks,

482
00:34:43,435 --> 00:34:46,076
time for me to fill in
the paperwork for the police.

483
00:34:46,545 --> 00:34:50,248
And meanwhile...
you'll stay with my grandmother.

484
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:52,574
The one who thinks you're a good man?

485
00:34:52,785 --> 00:34:54,957
Yes... but she knows me.

486
00:35:00,043 --> 00:35:01,930
So sweet and clever.

487
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,051
You can tell she's a convent girl.

488
00:35:04,122 --> 00:35:06,867
Yes, she was in a very modern one.

489
00:35:07,266 --> 00:35:08,797
Ah, you're lucky!

490
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:11,352
I would never expect such a nice girl...

491
00:35:11,516 --> 00:35:13,664
to accept being married to a cop!

492
00:35:13,773 --> 00:35:16,242
My parents would not have allowed that!

493
00:35:16,391 --> 00:35:18,344
Police are so vulgar!

494
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:21,742
Thank God...

495
00:35:21,844 --> 00:35:24,049
he didn't pick for his fiancee...

496
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,858
a jailbird!

497
00:35:28,363 --> 00:35:31,648
You know, he's capable of anything!

498
00:35:31,718 --> 00:35:34,519
Ma'am, please let me wash up.

499
00:35:34,636 --> 00:35:36,745
No, I want to leave you two alone.

500
00:35:36,988 --> 00:35:40,435
Don't say no.
I've been watching you...

501
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:44,800
You haven't kissed Virginie once
since she arrived a week ago.

502
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,776
Of course he has!
- No.

503
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:48,968
Once you're married,
I'll leave you this apartment

504
00:35:49,038 --> 00:35:51,074
go live in Chantilly with my sister.

505
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:52,933
I won't see you anymore!

506
00:35:54,245 --> 00:35:56,347
Don't you see that I'm...

507
00:35:56,418 --> 00:35:59,105
an old friend
who's warmed by your happiness?

508
00:35:59,347 --> 00:36:00,901
What are you waiting for?

509
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,127
What?

510
00:36:02,198 --> 00:36:03,370
Have you no heart?

511
00:36:04,003 --> 00:36:05,261
Kiss me!

512
00:36:19,338 --> 00:36:21,081
Is she still there?

513
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:23,518
Yes.

514
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:29,417
Jean...

515
00:36:30,885 --> 00:36:32,471
What, darling?

516
00:36:38,346 --> 00:36:39,963
I really like your Grandma.

517
00:36:40,127 --> 00:36:41,784
I was just sparing her feelings...

518
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,946
so don't imagine anything else.

519
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:45,752
Don't worry.
I have no imagination.

520
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:47,831
Our marriage is a deal:

521
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:50,846
I get out of jail
and that's a lot.

522
00:36:51,323 --> 00:36:53,533
And you get me.
That's not bad either.

523
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,190
But let's not discuss it.

524
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:56,682
I completely agree.

525
00:36:56,806 --> 00:36:59,174
And I've decided you won't be mine
until you love me.

526
00:36:59,245 --> 00:37:01,752
You can wait forever!
- Don't be hasty.

527
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:04,643
Maybe one day... who knows?
- But... - I said maybe.

528
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:09,963
Just come to me then
and scratch at my door.

529
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:13,002
It will mean:
"I'm dishonored but I love you."

530
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,308
Hello?

531
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:29,531
Jerome! Yes, I'm listening. Yes.

532
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:32,863
Virginie, can you open the door?
- Of course.

533
00:37:38,577 --> 00:37:40,413
What is this, Miss?

534
00:37:40,537 --> 00:37:41,614
A feather duster.

535
00:37:41,685 --> 00:37:45,310
Bravo, Miss! You just won first prize
in our radio contest.

536
00:37:45,381 --> 00:37:48,311
Next question:
You want to see Olga?

537
00:37:49,807 --> 00:37:51,242
You're the guy on the scooter!

538
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:54,241
Right. Meet her in 10 minutes
on St. Gregoire St.

539
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:57,075
Correct, Miss!
Napoleon did die on St. Helena!

540
00:37:57,146 --> 00:37:58,184
Bravo, Miss!

541
00:37:58,255 --> 00:38:02,060
With the compliments of Dustatom,
the feather that tickles the dust!

542
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:04,009
Thank you!

543
00:38:11,837 --> 00:38:14,251
Here come 50 shrimps!

544
00:38:15,298 --> 00:38:16,408
Yes, I'm coming!

545
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:18,611
What's that?
- My own recipe.

546
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:23,306
So... you seduced a cop?

547
00:38:23,493 --> 00:38:25,387
Yes. And now I have to marry him.

548
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:26,477
Never!

549
00:38:26,548 --> 00:38:27,555
We'll rescue you.

550
00:38:27,626 --> 00:38:29,130
Is he wild and menacing?

551
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,977
No, he's rather handsome.

552
00:38:31,048 --> 00:38:32,329
I'd rather die.

553
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:33,962
I wouldn't go that far.

554
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,594
You still want to leave the country?

555
00:38:35,665 --> 00:38:38,186
Yes.. but the wedding's in 3 days.

556
00:38:38,257 --> 00:38:40,537
Don't worry. We can fix that.
- Let me tell you...

557
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,413
Who's doing the talking?

558
00:38:42,796 --> 00:38:45,936
Loulou, you're the boss...
but I'm a better talker, eh?

559
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:49,569
We smuggle old cameras.

560
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,100
We carry them over the border...

561
00:38:53,186 --> 00:38:55,655
and bring back hot stuff...

562
00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:58,623
with nothing for the customs tax.

563
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:01,649
You could come with us and
stay on the other side. OK?

564
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,732
OK... but you think that in 3 days...

565
00:39:03,803 --> 00:39:06,337
Tomorrow I see Raphael.
I'll talk about you.

566
00:39:06,408 --> 00:39:08,081
Give me your attention, please!

567
00:39:08,152 --> 00:39:10,369
A bit to the left, madam...
A bit to the left... there!

568
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,646
Sir, over there, over there!

569
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:12,935
Don't move any farther!

570
00:39:13,006 --> 00:39:14,357
Umbrellas!

571
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:17,940
Attention... 1... 2...

572
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,748
3... Thank you!

573
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:31,618
When will it be ready?
- Tonight, Miss... er, Madame.

574
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:34,663
But we'll be in the country!
- Give me the address, I'll bring them.

575
00:39:34,734 --> 00:39:37,171
Hurry up, Darling. We'll be late
at the church. - I'm coming!

576
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:38,944
At Leopold's near Chantilly.

577
00:39:39,015 --> 00:39:42,030
Leopold... write it as you hear it, OK?
Now come on!

578
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,754
Are they ready?
- Yes, they're all dry. I can leave now.

579
00:40:15,825 --> 00:40:19,439
Here it is. You'll get a new camera
in exchange at Lausanne.

580
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:23,267
Bring it back and be careful.
- I've never failed you, boss.

581
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,692
That's just the point.
Don't rest on your laurels.

582
00:40:26,098 --> 00:40:27,848
This is a big deal!

583
00:40:28,036 --> 00:40:29,481
When do you leave?

584
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:31,997
We'll stop at Leopold's Inn near Chantilly.

585
00:40:32,068 --> 00:40:35,869
I'll pick up Virginie
and we'll drive all night.

586
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,746
You'll reach the border in the morning?
- Yes, noon at the latest.

587
00:40:38,817 --> 00:40:42,211
Call from the border...
to make sure our custom man is on duty.

588
00:40:42,282 --> 00:40:43,535
Do I call you here?

589
00:40:43,738 --> 00:40:46,824
No! Never call me here
when you're on a mission.

590
00:40:47,384 --> 00:40:50,033
Call me at The Zenith.
- OK.

591
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:53,048
Hey! Hey!

592
00:40:55,195 --> 00:40:58,372
You're late!
- But we're here, that's what's important.

593
00:40:58,443 --> 00:40:59,665
You found the inn?
- Yes!

594
00:40:59,736 --> 00:41:00,790
They're all there.

595
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:03,088
Virginie looks great in her wedding dress!
- Who cares!

596
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:05,431
I'm going there. Wait for us
here and pitch the tents.

597
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:07,283
We must look like real campers!
- OK.

598
00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:21,314
Pierrot will wait with a scooter
behind the garden door.

599
00:41:21,385 --> 00:41:23,144
Escape as soon as you can.

600
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,807
And watch out for the dog.

601
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,215
Look. We're smuggling this one.

602
00:41:27,395 --> 00:41:29,161
This isn't fair to my husband.

603
00:41:29,232 --> 00:41:31,754
Don't back out now! You know
what's waiting for you...

604
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:33,051
A convict dress.

605
00:41:33,129 --> 00:41:34,582
Aha, my fellow!

606
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,292
I caught you, eh?
- Yes, sir.

607
00:41:36,363 --> 00:41:37,619
Are you flirting with my wife?

608
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,817
As punishment, I'll feed you.

609
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:41,714
You seem overcome by emotion.

610
00:41:42,114 --> 00:41:44,348
Well, naturally!

611
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:47,308
Look at this, boss!
It's older than the Ark.

612
00:41:48,151 --> 00:41:49,346
And heavy...

613
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:53,846
Listen! Must be something inside.

614
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:57,511
You look strange.
Let's get something to drink.

615
00:41:57,674 --> 00:42:00,580
So you act as if I didn't like
champagne, too. - Not at all!

616
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,198
Look, this one's my favorite!

617
00:42:05,111 --> 00:42:08,409
Leave Grandma alone
and she's surrounded by men!

618
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:12,253
When one marries such a lovely girl...
- You keep her for yourself!

619
00:42:12,324 --> 00:42:14,643
How sweet!
I'll play a tune on the piano.

620
00:42:14,714 --> 00:42:17,604
No, not the piano!
- The piano, yes!

621
00:42:19,416 --> 00:42:20,729
I'm leaving!

622
00:42:20,928 --> 00:42:23,401
I can't stand all these cops.
See you later.

623
00:42:24,018 --> 00:42:27,025
One minute, sir.
When do we get the photos?

624
00:42:27,096 --> 00:42:29,369
The photos... in 48 hours, sir.

625
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,830
Thanks...
Bring them to the police station.

626
00:42:31,901 --> 00:42:33,507
The police station?
- The police station.

627
00:42:33,577 --> 00:42:35,096
Certainly, Inspector.
- Very good.

628
00:42:35,456 --> 00:42:38,096
Jean, come look at this.
- Yes, Grandma.

629
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:57,933
What's going on?

630
00:42:58,004 --> 00:43:01,020
You wanted to see the boss,
Mr. Raphael? Here he is.

631
00:43:05,422 --> 00:43:06,641
Nice to meet you.

632
00:43:10,227 --> 00:43:14,797
I've just returned from abroad
and I don't like what I'm hearing.

633
00:43:14,922 --> 00:43:17,493
And I will no longer require your services.

634
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:19,563
We can always negotiate
about my percentage.

635
00:43:19,634 --> 00:43:21,446
I never negotiate.

636
00:43:22,126 --> 00:43:23,766
Where are the stones?

637
00:43:24,391 --> 00:43:26,187
They've gone to Rotterdam.

638
00:43:26,258 --> 00:43:28,626
How annoying.
Get them back.

639
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:31,532
It's too late! - Get them back now
or too bad for you!

640
00:43:31,954 --> 00:43:34,133
You'd be sorry, too...

641
00:43:34,337 --> 00:43:37,469
because... no Raphael, no emeralds.

642
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,251
I don't give a fuck what you're saying.

643
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:43,493
I'll never again work
with people I don't know.

644
00:43:45,618 --> 00:43:51,094
My carriers will call me tomorrow
before going through customs.

645
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:53,876
They'll call you here?
- Yes.

646
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:57,532
Then we'll wait together,
if you don't mind.

647
00:43:57,603 --> 00:44:01,133
Fine. I had no plans for tonight.

648
00:44:37,189 --> 00:44:38,853
You know my room is next door.

649
00:44:40,048 --> 00:44:42,415
It's simple. If you love me...

650
00:44:43,251 --> 00:44:44,572
I'll see you in a minute.

651
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,084
If you don't love me... sleep well.

652
00:45:23,748 --> 00:45:25,037
Look! That's her!

653
00:45:25,115 --> 00:45:28,076
She's about to escape.
Quick! Flash your lights!

654
00:45:32,123 --> 00:45:34,842
Go, Pierrot!
- I'm off.

655
00:45:36,381 --> 00:45:38,514
And us?
- We take down the tents.

656
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,849
No key!
- Shit!

657
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,401
You have the camera?
- Yes.

658
00:46:08,471 --> 00:46:09,719
Damn that dog!

659
00:46:09,789 --> 00:46:12,402
Climb over the wall.
I'll catch you on the other side.

660
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:26,734
What's happening?

661
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,038
Dirty beast! Let me go!

662
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,788
Pierrot! You're crazy!

663
00:46:51,859 --> 00:46:53,921
Not here, there's a pond!

664
00:46:53,992 --> 00:46:55,078
Pierrot!

665
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,390
You're perfect.

666
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,350
I said to come to the door
and you pass through the window.

667
00:47:37,484 --> 00:47:38,921
So you do love me.

668
00:47:52,921 --> 00:47:54,671
I don't think we made a mistake.

669
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:57,703
I'm sure we'll be very happy together.

670
00:47:59,694 --> 00:48:01,772
Are you crying?
- No.

671
00:48:02,015 --> 00:48:03,687
Yes, you are. Why?

672
00:48:05,277 --> 00:48:08,265
You're so kind.
- That's no reason.

673
00:48:14,152 --> 00:48:17,620
It's salty, eh?
- A little.

674
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:22,081
I swear to make you happy all my life.

675
00:48:23,558 --> 00:48:25,144
What's the matter, darling?

676
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:29,740
I love you! I love you!
I love you!

677
00:49:14,665 --> 00:49:17,415
Good morning.
- Good morning.

678
00:49:18,485 --> 00:49:20,047
Been awake long?

679
00:49:20,906 --> 00:49:23,055
No.
- "No."

680
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:25,485
Listen...

681
00:49:31,254 --> 00:49:32,433
I don't know.

682
00:49:33,976 --> 00:49:35,879
I already forgot "before".

683
00:49:48,504 --> 00:49:50,911
So?
- Nothing yet.

684
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:54,317
We're not gonna get anything
but pneumonia!

685
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:56,551
It's too early to call Raphael
at the Zenith.

686
00:49:56,622 --> 00:49:58,324
Call his house.
- He said not to.

687
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,402
It's an emergency.
- OK.

688
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:05,466
Poor girl, what an awful night
she probably had.

689
00:50:05,537 --> 00:50:07,355
Maybe she's getting used to it.

690
00:50:07,886 --> 00:50:09,925
Pierrot, come down!

691
00:50:11,707 --> 00:50:14,121
Ten thousand more. Four aces.

692
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:16,988
You win.

693
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,820
Sorry there's no extension.

694
00:50:23,891 --> 00:50:25,773
Just tell them to come here.

695
00:50:28,727 --> 00:50:29,852
Yes?

696
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,528
We're still near Chantilly.
We couldn't...

697
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:35,669
Don't worry. Counter offer.
Come back fast, all of you.

698
00:50:35,747 --> 00:50:40,047
OK... meet at the place
where you're waiting?

699
00:50:40,781 --> 00:50:42,383
Exactly. Hurry.

700
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:51,999
They'll be here tonight.
They're at the border.

701
00:50:52,874 --> 00:50:55,913
It's hot in here.
Shall I open a window?

702
00:50:56,288 --> 00:50:57,819
Go ahead.

703
00:51:02,715 --> 00:51:04,347
Not much of a game.

704
00:51:04,418 --> 00:51:06,596
It's not over... until tonight.

705
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:08,480
You like big shots?
- Yes.

706
00:51:08,551 --> 00:51:10,290
So much the better!

707
00:51:15,152 --> 00:51:17,316
Don't shoot.
I want to know where he's going.

708
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,000
Hurry! We're leaving!
- Where to?

709
00:51:26,071 --> 00:51:27,297
The Zenith.
- You sure?

710
00:51:27,368 --> 00:51:29,773
Yes, the planned meeting place.
- Did he yell at you?

711
00:51:29,844 --> 00:51:32,463
No, but he's going to!
- Speak for yourself.

712
00:51:33,274 --> 00:51:36,438
Meet us later.
Try to get the camera back.

713
00:51:36,509 --> 00:51:38,344
Why do I always get the risky jobs?

714
00:51:38,415 --> 00:51:40,020
Yes, why does he?

715
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:42,697
Rebelling? You
want to die young?

716
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:45,126
Sometimes I wonder who's the boss here!

717
00:51:45,197 --> 00:51:48,799
Loulou!
Get the camera back or else!

718
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,828
What's that camera?

719
00:52:14,953 --> 00:52:18,445
Where did you get it?
It belongs to the photographer.

720
00:52:18,694 --> 00:52:20,959
He simply forgot it.
Give it to me.

721
00:52:21,052 --> 00:52:23,205
Since you're going to the station,
take it with you.

722
00:52:23,275 --> 00:52:25,584
Give it to him
when he delivers the photos.

723
00:52:26,296 --> 00:52:28,489
Darling, we'll finish this...
then leave right away.

724
00:52:34,428 --> 00:52:37,053
One club soda... no, two!

725
00:52:37,506 --> 00:52:39,389
Coming right up!

726
00:52:43,382 --> 00:52:46,325
The bill, please!
- Right away, Mr. Morel.

727
00:52:51,044 --> 00:52:52,997
And then, as you found...

728
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:07,549
The bill, Mr. Morel.

729
00:53:11,056 --> 00:53:12,951
We had 33 bottles of champagne?

730
00:53:13,142 --> 00:53:15,329
No.
- You were here, of course.

731
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,732
I had only one, maybe two...

732
00:53:17,914 --> 00:53:18,930
Jerome!

733
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,628
How much for the sodas?
- 160 francs.

734
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,123
There are too many cops here for me!

735
00:53:24,194 --> 00:53:27,517
My darling... want to go
to the arcades this afternoon?

736
00:53:28,886 --> 00:53:31,579
No, I don't like them!
- Really?

737
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:35,303
No... ouch!
- You'll go anyway! Come on!

738
00:53:42,842 --> 00:53:45,143
Bravo! That's how to tame women!

739
00:53:45,213 --> 00:53:47,668
Darling, do you want to go
to the arcades with me?

740
00:53:47,955 --> 00:53:50,594
Yes, my darling!
- Very good! I like your obedience.

741
00:53:50,993 --> 00:53:53,416
What's going on?
- Ya-ya-ya... no gas!

742
00:53:53,487 --> 00:53:54,577
Why didn't you fill it up?

743
00:53:54,647 --> 00:53:56,844
I didn't have time!
I have to think about everything!

744
00:53:56,915 --> 00:54:00,993
I tried to help but you don't
have the brains to be a leader.

745
00:54:01,064 --> 00:54:03,319
Give me a break! If you're not happy...
- Yes?

746
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:07,125
Walk back!
- OK, watch me walking!

747
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:09,370
Hey! Hey! Hey!

748
00:54:10,793 --> 00:54:11,904
Bitch!

749
00:54:13,514 --> 00:54:17,316
Can you give me a ride, please!
- Sure, get in. - Thanks.

750
00:54:18,642 --> 00:54:22,184
Where are you going?
- Paris. - Me too.

751
00:54:27,637 --> 00:54:30,821
Haven't I seen you before... eh?

752
00:54:31,047 --> 00:54:32,195
Yes.

753
00:54:32,266 --> 00:54:34,133
Thought so. Where?

754
00:54:34,203 --> 00:54:36,709
On the road two minutes ago.
You remember?

755
00:54:37,075 --> 00:54:40,443
No... I've seen you somewhere else...

756
00:54:53,142 --> 00:54:54,410
Thanks again.

757
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:56,450
I can't remember where I saw you...

758
00:54:57,031 --> 00:54:58,724
You're so sweet!

759
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,720
Goodbye just like that?

760
00:55:03,429 --> 00:55:05,547
I'll never forget you.

761
00:55:05,683 --> 00:55:06,760
Nor will I.

762
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:08,808
Goodbye, mister.
- Goodbye.

763
00:55:09,998 --> 00:55:11,891
Sometimes I like being a cop.

764
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:25,084
Hey, Mr. Raphael!
- Where's the camera?

765
00:55:25,744 --> 00:55:27,081
We lost it.

766
00:55:27,272 --> 00:55:28,522
Are you crazy?!

767
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:31,002
Don't get upset.
Maybe Pierrot will find it.

768
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:32,323
Maybe!

769
00:55:32,394 --> 00:55:34,147
If not, we'll buy you another.

770
00:55:34,217 --> 00:55:35,649
I want this one!

771
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,654
Let's wait for Pierrot.

772
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:40,137
A light...?

773
00:56:04,538 --> 00:56:05,683
Well?

774
00:56:05,754 --> 00:56:07,281
Virginie is here with her husband.

775
00:56:07,368 --> 00:56:10,040
She nodded to me...
she doesn't have the camera.

776
00:56:10,111 --> 00:56:12,297
Where is she now?
- At the bumper cars.

777
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:14,433
I want to know where it is!
Go ask her where it is!

778
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:17,080
Her husband will see me!
- Do it! Quick! Quick!

779
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:26,091
I'll explain...

780
00:56:26,368 --> 00:56:29,805
I put the stones in a camera.
- Uh huh... That's intelligent.

781
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:32,610
And the camera got lost.
- That's too bad.

782
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:35,618
But we'll find it. The Inspector's wife
is taking care of the problem.

783
00:56:35,748 --> 00:56:37,884
Doesn't sound too serious to me.

784
00:56:37,955 --> 00:56:41,304
What are you doing?
- Corpses should be nameless.

785
00:56:43,897 --> 00:56:46,113
Hey! What are you doing here?!

786
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:01,725
Where is she?
- There, with her cop.

787
00:57:01,796 --> 00:57:03,547
I'll talk to him.
- Are you crazy?

788
00:57:03,618 --> 00:57:05,304
I'll tell the Inspector everything.

789
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:09,349
His wife's involved, he'll deal with her.
At least I'll be safe in jail.

790
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:12,240
No, don't go! You have no right!

791
00:57:15,708 --> 00:57:18,755
Hey! Inspector!

792
00:57:22,774 --> 00:57:24,154
You have a shot!

793
00:57:29,457 --> 00:57:31,279
You know him?
- No!

794
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:29,697
Stop! Stop!

795
00:58:39,906 --> 00:58:42,310
I'm Inspector Morel.
Call the police.

796
00:58:43,951 --> 00:58:47,588
Don't move. Stay in your cars.
It's nothing. Don't move.

797
00:58:47,668 --> 00:58:50,027
Don't drive. Stay in your cars.

798
00:58:50,904 --> 00:58:53,343
Is there a doctor here, please?

799
00:58:58,673 --> 00:59:02,215
Don't move. Don't move.

800
00:59:02,813 --> 00:59:05,813
I'm Raphael...
It was I who...

801
00:59:35,878 --> 00:59:37,354
Jean!

802
00:59:39,263 --> 00:59:41,356
I searched him. No ID.

803
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,566
Scared?

804
00:59:46,113 --> 00:59:47,693
The killer might still be here.

805
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,620
I'm here, too.

806
00:59:50,929 --> 00:59:52,120
Did you know him?

807
00:59:52,908 --> 00:59:54,733
Huh? No!

808
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:56,641
He waved at you.

809
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,835
No, not at me!
It was you he waved at!

810
01:00:00,174 --> 01:00:03,750
Maybe... but are you sure
you've never met him?

811
01:00:05,511 --> 01:00:06,908
No.

812
01:00:08,484 --> 01:00:11,739
Don't stay here.
See you at home for dinner.

813
01:00:20,896 --> 01:00:23,231
You don't get killed
for smuggling cameras!

814
01:00:23,302 --> 01:00:24,919
Wasn't Virginie supposed to get killed?

815
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:26,617
Never!
- You said so!

816
01:00:26,688 --> 01:00:29,195
That was just talk.
This is a real murder.

817
01:00:29,266 --> 01:00:31,504
Right... what are we mixed up in?

818
01:00:31,826 --> 01:00:32,980
Here she is.

819
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,520
Do they know?
- Yes, I told them.

820
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,978
Did you see it?
- Everything.

821
01:00:39,049 --> 01:00:40,723
And the murderer?
- Yes.

822
01:00:40,984 --> 01:00:42,346
Do you know him?
- No.

823
01:00:42,676 --> 01:00:44,959
And Raphael?
- They haven't identified him.

824
01:00:45,567 --> 01:00:47,110
Jean asked if I knew him.

825
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:49,001
I said no,
so you wouldn't get caught.

826
01:00:49,072 --> 01:00:51,279
I knew you'd be loyal.

827
01:00:51,808 --> 01:00:54,326
We're in deep trouble!
- Yes!

828
01:00:54,907 --> 01:00:58,293
Let's take the scooters and
get out of Paris! - Yes!

829
01:00:59,378 --> 01:01:01,166
Not me!
- What?

830
01:01:01,409 --> 01:01:02,607
Not you?

831
01:01:02,961 --> 01:01:04,704
I'm not leaving Jean.

832
01:01:04,775 --> 01:01:07,805
Now this!
Yesterday you wanted to go away.

833
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:09,100
Yesterday I didn't know...

834
01:01:09,593 --> 01:01:10,678
I love him.

835
01:01:10,748 --> 01:01:12,300
Love a cop... you?

836
01:01:12,371 --> 01:01:13,393
And you love him?

837
01:01:13,464 --> 01:01:14,477
Yes!

838
01:01:14,548 --> 01:01:16,109
Well, good for you!

839
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,187
Well, it's good that he likes you...

840
01:01:18,283 --> 01:01:20,296
because when he knows
you worked for Raphael...

841
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:21,388
He'll never know!

842
01:01:21,459 --> 01:01:24,078
That's what you say.
He has all our names and addresses!

843
01:01:24,149 --> 01:01:25,497
And the wedding negatives.

844
01:01:25,992 --> 01:01:27,406
I'm going!
- Are you crazy?

845
01:01:27,571 --> 01:01:29,496
Jean mustn't know I worked for Raphael!

846
01:01:29,567 --> 01:01:30,962
But he loves and trusts you.

847
01:01:31,033 --> 01:01:33,245
He won't trust me anymore.

848
01:01:33,316 --> 01:01:34,617
Love solves everything!

849
01:01:34,688 --> 01:01:36,242
Not if I lose my husband!

850
01:01:36,312 --> 01:01:37,515
And I don't want to lose him!

851
01:01:37,586 --> 01:01:39,442
The police will be waiting at Raphael's.

852
01:01:39,513 --> 01:01:40,922
They haven't identified him yet.

853
01:01:40,993 --> 01:01:42,230
I'll get there before them.

854
01:01:42,301 --> 01:01:43,428
How will you get in?

855
01:01:43,521 --> 01:01:44,565
Through the roof.

856
01:01:44,636 --> 01:01:46,572
You might fall and kill yourself.

857
01:01:46,643 --> 01:01:47,985
I'm a professional.

858
01:01:48,056 --> 01:01:50,337
You can't go like that.
Give her your bottoms!

859
01:01:50,408 --> 01:01:51,578
My what?
- Your pants.

860
01:01:51,649 --> 01:01:53,375
No! I don't want a bare ass!

861
01:01:56,782 --> 01:01:59,266
Raphael was killed in public,
in broad daylight.

862
01:01:59,337 --> 01:02:00,556
With incredible boldness.

863
01:02:00,626 --> 01:02:02,644
Don't you recognize the style?
- What do you mean?

864
01:02:02,715 --> 01:02:04,337
It has the mark of Charlemagne.

865
01:02:04,409 --> 01:02:08,142
Jerome... wasn't it Raphael's car
that was stolen?

866
01:02:08,213 --> 01:02:09,468
Exactly.

867
01:02:09,538 --> 01:02:11,389
He's linked to the robbery.

868
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:12,948
Probably.

869
01:02:13,018 --> 01:02:14,632
Was he interrogated?
- Yes.

870
01:02:14,702 --> 01:02:16,159
No results?
- Nothing.

871
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:18,689
Who questioned him?
- I did.

872
01:02:18,889 --> 01:02:22,159
Now I understand.
Let's go to Raphael's, boss.

873
01:02:22,237 --> 01:02:23,375
Let's go.

874
01:02:28,852 --> 01:02:30,952
What are you doing here?

875
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,668
I'm just tidying up.

876
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:39,421
Sure... you stroll over the roof,
see an open window...

877
01:02:39,492 --> 01:02:41,643
and decide to tidy up.

878
01:02:41,714 --> 01:02:42,761
That's it.

879
01:02:42,857 --> 01:02:44,645
Why are you burning these papers?

880
01:02:45,376 --> 01:02:47,335
I don't want anybody
to know that I knew Raphael.

881
01:02:47,405 --> 01:02:48,744
Really... why?

882
01:02:49,638 --> 01:02:53,176
I posed for photos...
You know what I mean.

883
01:02:53,247 --> 01:02:54,447
Yes... OK.

884
01:02:55,601 --> 01:02:57,077
Can I see them?

885
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,960
You're Inspector Morel's wife?

886
01:03:03,031 --> 01:03:04,048
Yes.

887
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:06,331
You know Raphael's just been killed?

888
01:03:06,539 --> 01:03:07,572
Yes!

889
01:03:08,248 --> 01:03:09,475
And how do you know?

890
01:03:09,935 --> 01:03:13,529
The police just called me.
I was Raphael's lawyer...

891
01:03:13,834 --> 01:03:15,451
And his best friend.

892
01:03:15,865 --> 01:03:16,904
Poor fellow.

893
01:03:17,139 --> 01:03:19,584
We knew each other as children.

894
01:03:20,466 --> 01:03:22,425
Believe me, sir, you have all my sympathy.

895
01:03:22,496 --> 01:03:25,018
Thank you.
What are you doing here?

896
01:03:25,656 --> 01:03:27,617
Can I trust you?
- Absolutely.

897
01:03:27,843 --> 01:03:31,351
All right... I was working for Raphael.

898
01:03:31,422 --> 01:03:33,205
You worked for Raphael?

899
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:34,584
I was smuggling cameras.

900
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,718
Illegally!

901
01:03:35,789 --> 01:03:37,359
That's very serious.

902
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:39,231
But I still have one camera.
- Where?

903
01:03:39,301 --> 01:03:41,538
At the police station.
Isn't that silly?

904
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,315
Very... Can you get it back?

905
01:03:45,057 --> 01:03:46,073
Of course.

906
01:03:46,144 --> 01:03:47,596
Get it to me fast.

907
01:03:47,667 --> 01:03:50,869
I promise I won't say a word
to the police or your husband.

908
01:03:50,979 --> 01:03:53,580
Oh thank you, sir!
You're a real pal!

909
01:03:53,651 --> 01:03:56,299
Don't mention it.
Call me at this number.

910
01:03:58,507 --> 01:03:59,647
OK.

911
01:03:59,718 --> 01:04:01,242
Now...

912
01:04:02,526 --> 01:04:04,776
Who is this young person?
- It's Olga.

913
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,698
She can be very useful to you.

914
01:04:08,769 --> 01:04:09,830
She saw Raphael's killer

915
01:04:09,901 --> 01:04:12,758
You don't say.
That's very interesting.

916
01:04:13,236 --> 01:04:14,728
Where can I meet her?

917
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:16,346
At the Zenith bar on Gaite street.

918
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:17,694
Thanks.

919
01:04:18,057 --> 01:04:20,171
Can I finish burning this?
- Sure, go ahead.

920
01:04:20,242 --> 01:04:21,385
Thanks.

921
01:04:27,938 --> 01:04:29,173
Open up! Police!

922
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:33,868
My husband! Don't open it!
- I won't. Run!

923
01:04:34,548 --> 01:04:36,158
Hey! Don't forget the camera!

924
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:50,479
Fire! Fire!

925
01:05:06,956 --> 01:05:10,580
Sorry. - It's me. - Excuse me.
- After you. - May I?

926
01:05:14,323 --> 01:05:15,752
What a charming gentleman!

927
01:05:32,477 --> 01:05:33,671
It's amazing.

928
01:05:34,047 --> 01:05:36,555
He ran away so fast I couldn't catch him.

929
01:05:36,625 --> 01:05:38,399
Don't worry, it's not your fault.

930
01:05:39,461 --> 01:05:44,031
Well... do you know anyone who
can walk roofs like they were sidewalks?

931
01:05:44,531 --> 01:05:47,102
No... none of my relatives.

932
01:05:48,367 --> 01:05:50,570
But I do.
- Where are you going?

933
01:05:50,828 --> 01:05:52,521
Home! Then I'll know for sure.

934
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:55,734
When you're finished, meet me there!

935
01:05:58,695 --> 01:06:00,813
Just a minute, old man!
What are you taking away?

936
01:06:00,884 --> 01:06:02,289
Ashes from the stove.

937
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,524
You must learn that to the police,
ashes talk.

938
01:06:57,033 --> 01:06:58,151
Virginie!

939
01:06:58,222 --> 01:06:59,987
Yes! Come in here!

940
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,811
Guess who I'm disguised as!

941
01:07:05,905 --> 01:07:07,030
Joan of Arc?

942
01:07:08,006 --> 01:07:09,616
You guessed it right away!

943
01:07:11,483 --> 01:07:13,670
And you?
You're disguised as a chimney sweep?

944
01:07:13,741 --> 01:07:16,701
Yes, I chased an acrobat on the roofs.

945
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:18,545
An acrobat?

946
01:07:18,764 --> 01:07:19,913
Yes, an acrobat.

947
01:07:20,846 --> 01:07:21,866
That's strange, no?

948
01:07:22,116 --> 01:07:23,147
Very.

949
01:07:23,218 --> 01:07:24,280
Did you catch him?

950
01:07:24,351 --> 01:07:26,209
No, darling.
I'm no acrobat.

951
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:27,780
I'll teach you.

952
01:07:29,544 --> 01:07:30,596
I'll get it.

953
01:07:30,666 --> 01:07:32,381
Not in that costume!

954
01:07:32,522 --> 01:07:34,709
No one must know you're mad.

955
01:07:34,795 --> 01:07:36,030
They'll find out eventually.

956
01:07:36,101 --> 01:07:37,608
Go and dress like a lady.

957
01:07:45,655 --> 01:07:48,443
Look what I found in the stove.

958
01:07:48,514 --> 01:07:50,155
Don't show that here. Hide it.

959
01:07:50,573 --> 01:07:52,095
You have some nerve!

960
01:07:52,165 --> 01:07:54,903
Coming by at meal time!
Do you expect us to feed you?

961
01:07:54,973 --> 01:07:56,722
Nice try! Nice try!

962
01:07:58,978 --> 01:08:00,307
Now show me.

963
01:08:00,378 --> 01:08:02,566
I'll show you pictures
of the famous Olga.

964
01:08:04,245 --> 01:08:05,972
Mysterious invoices...

965
01:08:06,331 --> 01:08:08,167
for scooters bought by Raphael.

966
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:11,091
And there it is.

967
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:14,244
Look and compare
with the picture on her ID.

968
01:08:15,997 --> 01:08:18,432
The irony is that she hitched a ride
with me this morning.

969
01:08:18,513 --> 01:08:19,587
Where was this?

970
01:08:19,657 --> 01:08:20,965
Near the inn.
- Yes.

971
01:08:21,825 --> 01:08:25,333
I dropped her at a bar on
Gaite Street called... the Zenith.

972
01:08:25,404 --> 01:08:27,872
The Zenith on Gaite... I know the place.

973
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:29,427
Good. What's cooking?

974
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:41,989
Look! What is this!

975
01:08:45,185 --> 01:08:46,341
Pants?

976
01:08:47,247 --> 01:08:48,710
You're on a diet?

977
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:49,987
It's overcooked.

978
01:08:52,067 --> 01:08:53,146
Wait...

979
01:08:54,278 --> 01:08:56,317
Virginie steals Raphael's car...

980
01:08:56,974 --> 01:08:58,896
Raphael is killed near Virginie...

981
01:08:59,411 --> 01:09:02,177
and Olga poses for Raphael,
so she knows about Virginie...

982
01:09:02,885 --> 01:09:04,276
A young man runs across a roof...

983
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:07,166
then these pants in Virginie's pot.
What would you do?

984
01:09:07,237 --> 01:09:09,581
I'd talk to Virginie.
- Don't be stupid.

985
01:09:10,737 --> 01:09:11,932
Virginie!

986
01:09:14,635 --> 01:09:16,283
Yes, my darling!

987
01:09:19,424 --> 01:09:20,698
Listen, Virginie...

988
01:09:21,229 --> 01:09:23,378
The roof acrobat that I was chasing...

989
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,714
was a girl.

990
01:09:25,018 --> 01:09:26,581
And you know her well...

991
01:09:29,323 --> 01:09:30,417
Olga!

992
01:09:30,909 --> 01:09:33,214
Your fellow escapee
from the Bon Pasteur.

993
01:09:34,549 --> 01:09:35,893
Poor girl.

994
01:09:37,026 --> 01:09:38,745
Arson, burglary...

995
01:09:38,956 --> 01:09:41,221
trespassing and above all...

996
01:09:41,464 --> 01:09:43,510
Above all, accessory to murder.

997
01:09:45,034 --> 01:09:46,526
At least 10 years.

998
01:09:47,581 --> 01:09:49,089
She wasn't as lucky as you.

999
01:09:51,339 --> 01:09:53,846
Jerome and I will catch her in a bar...

1000
01:09:54,354 --> 01:09:55,510
the Zenith.

1001
01:10:02,969 --> 01:10:04,102
I must be going.

1002
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:06,274
Don't wait for me.

1003
01:10:06,797 --> 01:10:07,867
Hope you're not too upset.

1004
01:10:08,164 --> 01:10:09,281
Why?

1005
01:10:09,516 --> 01:10:12,141
This was our first newlywed dinner.

1006
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:15,867
Let's go, Jerome.

1007
01:10:16,594 --> 01:10:18,524
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1008
01:10:22,773 --> 01:10:23,819
Go back to her.

1009
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:26,195
Say anything but stay with her
for 15 minutes, then leave.

1010
01:10:26,266 --> 01:10:27,293
What should I tell her?

1011
01:10:27,363 --> 01:10:29,438
Quick, before she gets to the phone!

1012
01:10:37,406 --> 01:10:38,711
Jerome, what do you want?

1013
01:10:38,782 --> 01:10:40,133
I forgot something.
- What?

1014
01:10:40,211 --> 01:10:43,039
I've forgotten what.
But I must find what I've forgotten.

1015
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:45,254
And when I find it,
I'll know what I've forgotten.

1016
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:47,536
A hat?
- Yes! No! Not a hat.

1017
01:10:47,792 --> 01:10:49,340
Your coat?
- Maybe.

1018
01:10:49,785 --> 01:10:52,214
Well, it's not here.
- Yes, I see that.

1019
01:10:52,285 --> 01:10:53,377
Your glasses?

1020
01:10:53,448 --> 01:10:55,963
Yes, that's possible!
I couldn't see too well, so I thought...

1021
01:10:56,034 --> 01:10:59,276
I must have left them...
but I was wrong...

1022
01:10:59,417 --> 01:11:02,221
because they're on my nose.

1023
01:11:02,513 --> 01:11:04,825
I have a superb memory,
but I can't remember...

1024
01:11:05,072 --> 01:11:06,392
what I'm looking for.

1025
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:09,685
Say, Jerome... where's the old camera
you saw at our wedding?

1026
01:11:10,028 --> 01:11:12,044
In my office at the station.
- Perfect.

1027
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:14,957
I still can't remember
what I'm looking for...

1028
01:11:15,036 --> 01:11:17,036
But what are you looking for?

1029
01:11:32,153 --> 01:11:34,932
My god, I must be going!
How time flies!

1030
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:38,794
I'll have to try harder.
Sorry I disturbed you!

1031
01:11:39,005 --> 01:11:42,692
It's not really important... I guess.

1032
01:11:42,802 --> 01:11:44,458
OK, bye now.
- Good evening! Goodbye.

1033
01:12:00,848 --> 01:12:04,246
Pierrot, quick!
Telephone! Hurry!

1034
01:12:06,771 --> 01:12:09,255
Yes, it's me... Virginie?

1035
01:12:11,075 --> 01:12:12,810
They're coming? No!

1036
01:12:13,146 --> 01:12:15,216
OK, we're getting out of here.

1037
01:12:17,169 --> 01:12:19,074
The police!
- Let's get out of here!

1038
01:12:19,145 --> 01:12:20,948
Where's Loulou?
- At the garage.

1039
01:12:21,019 --> 01:12:23,589
We must get to him, too.
Come on, hurry up!

1040
01:12:28,943 --> 01:12:30,020
Police!

1041
01:12:30,568 --> 01:12:32,318
Don't you know who I am?
- No.

1042
01:12:32,966 --> 01:12:36,169
Of course you do... Inspector Morel.

1043
01:12:37,177 --> 01:12:38,302
Let's sit down.

1044
01:12:39,669 --> 01:12:40,927
A whiskey, please.

1045
01:12:52,489 --> 01:12:54,747
No one else should hear
what I'm going to tell you.

1046
01:12:54,818 --> 01:12:55,848
Sit down.

1047
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:01,739
Say... you have a nice skirt!

1048
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:06,435
Shut up!

1049
01:13:09,161 --> 01:13:10,622
So you're the gang!

1050
01:13:12,161 --> 01:13:14,185
How much is it?
- It's on the house.

1051
01:13:17,474 --> 01:13:19,153
Cigarette, anyone?
- No!

1052
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:24,075
I came to talk about Virginie.
Do you know her?

1053
01:13:24,849 --> 01:13:25,950
No!

1054
01:13:27,419 --> 01:13:28,958
Your loyalty is touching.

1055
01:13:29,825 --> 01:13:32,221
Who's the girl that escaped with you
from the Bon Pasteur?

1056
01:13:32,292 --> 01:13:34,208
I don't know.
Never saw her again.

1057
01:13:34,364 --> 01:13:36,916
She's my wife.
- Congratulations.

1058
01:13:36,987 --> 01:13:38,591
What's her connection to you?

1059
01:13:38,693 --> 01:13:40,724
Nothing!
- Nothing?

1060
01:13:41,755 --> 01:13:43,059
Well, that's enough.

1061
01:13:45,349 --> 01:13:47,755
This here, you know it?
- A little.

1062
01:13:48,161 --> 01:13:51,286
Why did my wife try to burn
these pictures? - I don't know.

1063
01:13:51,357 --> 01:13:53,940
Why did she just call here?
- Nobody called.

1064
01:13:54,026 --> 01:13:55,130
I'll tell you why...

1065
01:13:56,278 --> 01:13:58,497
She telephoned to warn you
that I was on the way here.

1066
01:13:58,568 --> 01:13:59,732
And you're guilty.

1067
01:14:00,028 --> 01:14:01,790
I'll arrest all of you
unless you tell me

1068
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,873
the connection between
Raphael, my wife and you.

1069
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:06,528
I just posed for photos.
- Really?

1070
01:14:08,842 --> 01:14:12,178
And your scooters?
Did they pose for photos, too?

1071
01:14:13,288 --> 01:14:14,803
What's this, Pierre Voinquel?

1072
01:14:20,546 --> 01:14:22,108
I want the truth now.

1073
01:14:23,139 --> 01:14:25,225
Can I ask you a question, Mr. Inspector?

1074
01:14:26,058 --> 01:14:27,217
Go ahead.

1075
01:14:27,288 --> 01:14:29,686
Will you arrest your wife, too?

1076
01:14:31,522 --> 01:14:32,655
Yes, if she deserves it.

1077
01:14:34,421 --> 01:14:36,092
That's a good way to go.

1078
01:14:37,577 --> 01:14:39,038
Take a look at these.

1079
01:14:42,702 --> 01:14:45,874
No! I'll tell you everything!
- Don't you dare!

1080
01:14:46,178 --> 01:14:47,960
Stop playing and let her speak!

1081
01:14:50,507 --> 01:14:51,624
Speak.

1082
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:53,483
Pierrot, don't be angry.

1083
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:56,585
So, you see...

1084
01:14:57,624 --> 01:14:58,866
You've had enough!

1085
01:14:58,937 --> 01:15:01,503
I'll kick his ass! I hate cops.
- Stay here! Don't go!

1086
01:15:01,573 --> 01:15:04,280
You'll see when he goes out!

1087
01:15:04,427 --> 01:15:07,200
We don't want to see!
- I'll make mincemeat of him!

1088
01:15:07,471 --> 01:15:10,010
That's all.
We didn't know it was so serious.

1089
01:15:10,143 --> 01:15:11,877
We mainly wanted to travel.

1090
01:15:13,815 --> 01:15:16,796
How much did Raphael pay you
to smuggle the cameras?

1091
01:15:16,866 --> 01:15:17,986
50,000.

1092
01:15:18,245 --> 01:15:20,174
Per person?
- No, for all of us.

1093
01:15:21,463 --> 01:15:23,041
That's a good price for cameras.

1094
01:15:25,518 --> 01:15:29,838
So... my wife has the one
that should have crossed today.

1095
01:15:29,917 --> 01:15:31,088
Yes.

1096
01:15:31,244 --> 01:15:32,775
Well, then...

1097
01:15:32,963 --> 01:15:35,581
You're assholes to risk jail
for 50,000 francs!

1098
01:15:36,581 --> 01:15:38,323
You three are in big trouble.

1099
01:15:39,057 --> 01:15:40,784
I'll try to get you off lightly.

1100
01:15:40,855 --> 01:15:44,245
Stay here and wait.
Don't move until I return.

1101
01:15:44,718 --> 01:15:46,726
If you do, I'll get you
the maximum sentence.

1102
01:15:47,237 --> 01:15:48,456
See you soon.

1103
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:52,986
Hey you!
- Sit down.

1104
01:15:54,815 --> 01:15:56,792
Pierrot, put on a record.

1105
01:16:02,573 --> 01:16:04,307
Bitch!

1106
01:16:04,854 --> 01:16:06,627
Leave her alone!
- Then you'll pay for her!

1107
01:16:06,698 --> 01:16:07,814
I'm sick of you! Enough!

1108
01:16:07,885 --> 01:16:09,713
Olga, phone call from Virginie.

1109
01:16:09,784 --> 01:16:13,534
Good! I'll tell her how you chickened out!

1110
01:16:17,635 --> 01:16:19,690
Hello? Yes, it's me.

1111
01:16:20,135 --> 01:16:22,104
A message from Virginie, Miss Olga.

1112
01:16:22,526 --> 01:16:25,799
Meet her right away at the corner
of Gaite and Sebastien.

1113
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:27,792
Come quickly. It's urgent.

1114
01:16:29,112 --> 01:16:30,151
Yes.

1115
01:16:33,862 --> 01:16:35,698
Are you crazy, Olga?

1116
01:16:35,768 --> 01:16:37,401
You know what the Inspector said!

1117
01:16:39,151 --> 01:16:41,072
Pierrot...
- What?

1118
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:43,190
It's no fun being gangsters.

1119
01:16:50,307 --> 01:16:52,221
No! Let me go!

1120
01:17:04,893 --> 01:17:05,971
Say...

1121
01:17:06,674 --> 01:17:09,783
When you were with her earlier,
did my wife mention the camera!

1122
01:17:12,174 --> 01:17:14,174
Umm... no.
- Don't lie.

1123
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,479
Well, she spoke about it casually
but she certainly...

1124
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:19,635
didn't know what was inside it.
- You think so?

1125
01:17:20,026 --> 01:17:21,260
Yes.

1126
01:17:21,362 --> 01:17:22,807
Then why are you lying?

1127
01:17:23,151 --> 01:17:24,229
Uh...

1128
01:17:24,721 --> 01:17:26,604
Good. Get me some fake emeralds...

1129
01:17:26,729 --> 01:17:28,268
from the evidence services.

1130
01:17:28,487 --> 01:17:30,745
But make sure they're perfect copies
and get them fast.

1131
01:17:30,816 --> 01:17:32,444
What if they're closed?

1132
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:35,643
Find a way!
I can't do everything!

1133
01:17:39,422 --> 01:17:40,641
Sorry.

1134
01:17:41,469 --> 01:17:43,227
You must be miserable.

1135
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,453
Yes... very.

1136
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:05,929
Where are you taking me?

1137
01:18:11,492 --> 01:18:13,109
Let me go!

1138
01:18:19,867 --> 01:18:22,359
If only I'd listened to that cop!

1139
01:18:24,422 --> 01:18:25,703
Let me go!

1140
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,695
Let me go!

1141
01:18:27,906 --> 01:18:29,109
Put me down!

1142
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:37,242
There... the best copies. Be careful.
They're worth 5,000 francs.

1143
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,992
The real ones are worth 50 million.

1144
01:18:39,468 --> 01:18:41,359
Just like with women...

1145
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:44,734
You can't tell between
the fake and the real thing.

1146
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:49,367
Don't mix them up.
- Yes.

1147
01:18:50,602 --> 01:18:51,719
Hello?

1148
01:18:52,109 --> 01:18:53,242
Virginie?

1149
01:18:54,055 --> 01:18:56,820
Darling, I won't be home for dinner.

1150
01:18:57,398 --> 01:18:58,867
I have to work all night here.

1151
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:01,891
It would be very nice if you brought me...

1152
01:19:02,766 --> 01:19:04,555
some sandwiches...

1153
01:19:05,203 --> 01:19:06,523
and some coffee.

1154
01:19:07,836 --> 01:19:10,328
Yes... unless you're in bed already.

1155
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,781
That's very kind. See you soon.

1156
01:19:15,766 --> 01:19:16,859
What are you doing?

1157
01:19:17,266 --> 01:19:18,601
Setting a trap.

1158
01:19:20,289 --> 01:19:22,273
Wouldn't you rather be frank with her?

1159
01:19:22,344 --> 01:19:25,590
Of course... but I want to know
where these stones are going.

1160
01:19:28,512 --> 01:19:30,004
So yes or no?
- No!

1161
01:19:36,223 --> 01:19:39,715
Hello? Ah, it's you, Virginie.

1162
01:19:40,747 --> 01:19:42,668
I'll give you the camera in half an hour

1163
01:19:42,809 --> 01:19:45,653
at the corner of Pont St. Michel
and police headquarters.

1164
01:19:46,528 --> 01:19:47,989
Then things will be OK, eh?

1165
01:19:48,918 --> 01:19:50,082
All finished?

1166
01:19:50,364 --> 01:19:52,012
Of course, sweetheart.

1167
01:19:52,668 --> 01:19:55,215
I'll send my driver.
- See you soon.

1168
01:20:01,481 --> 01:20:03,918
I locked my office
so she has to go through yours.

1169
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:06,629
It's very simple.

1170
01:20:07,004 --> 01:20:10,864
She won't take risks
for an old camera...

1171
01:20:11,731 --> 01:20:14,691
but she will
if she knows about the stones.

1172
01:20:14,918 --> 01:20:16,348
Big risk for her.

1173
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:17,997
Very true.

1174
01:20:18,567 --> 01:20:20,153
What about you two?

1175
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:22,926
If she takes the camera,
I won't see her again.

1176
01:20:22,997 --> 01:20:24,864
Don't say that.
- Never again!

1177
01:20:27,887 --> 01:20:29,543
Is that you, Virginie?
- Yes.

1178
01:20:29,714 --> 01:20:32,416
Be nice, go through Jerome's office.
I forgot my key. - OK.

1179
01:20:32,487 --> 01:20:33,753
Go and hide downstairs.

1180
01:20:33,925 --> 01:20:36,972
Follow her when she leaves.
I'll join you later.

1181
01:20:40,315 --> 01:20:42,683
So, Jerome, did you find
what you'd forgotten?

1182
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:44,471
Yes! No!

1183
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:47,509
I wanted to tell you
that your husband loves you.

1184
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:48,596
I know!

1185
01:20:48,667 --> 01:20:50,174
See you later, then.

1186
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:51,440
Oh, Virginie!
- Yes?

1187
01:20:51,511 --> 01:20:53,495
And you... do you love him?
- Yes!

1188
01:20:53,566 --> 01:20:57,487
Then tell him. And never hurt him.
- Of course.

1189
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:14,901
Jean! Open the door!

1190
01:21:15,233 --> 01:21:17,092
Look at your ideal wife!

1191
01:21:18,782 --> 01:21:23,149
Pastrami and cheese sandwiches,
a big apple and coffee.

1192
01:21:25,414 --> 01:21:28,719
Wake up!
It's me, your wife!

1193
01:21:29,383 --> 01:21:30,469
Come on, eat!

1194
01:21:31,078 --> 01:21:32,320
I'm no longer hungry.

1195
01:21:33,641 --> 01:21:35,094
Come over here.

1196
01:21:36,235 --> 01:21:37,414
You love me, right?

1197
01:21:37,524 --> 01:21:38,875
Oh yes, I love you!

1198
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:42,492
You wouldn't lie to me?

1199
01:21:42,563 --> 01:21:43,735
Me? Never!

1200
01:21:43,844 --> 01:21:47,727
Well... even if you did,
your mouth would open the same...

1201
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,742
and your eye would have
the same expression.

1202
01:21:49,813 --> 01:21:52,297
Nonsense! I'm a very bad liar.

1203
01:21:52,368 --> 01:21:53,773
You'd never hurt me?

1204
01:21:53,914 --> 01:21:56,110
Me? I'd die for you.

1205
01:21:56,532 --> 01:21:57,750
That's nice to know.

1206
01:21:58,414 --> 01:21:59,625
You don't believe me?

1207
01:22:00,571 --> 01:22:01,820
It's hard not to believe you.

1208
01:22:03,438 --> 01:22:05,492
Well... nothing else to tell me?

1209
01:22:06,953 --> 01:22:09,774
One thing... I'm very happy.

1210
01:22:10,313 --> 01:22:11,539
And you?

1211
01:22:12,282 --> 01:22:13,890
I can't believe it's happening.

1212
01:22:17,648 --> 01:22:18,828
Go home now.

1213
01:22:18,969 --> 01:22:20,477
Work to do?
- Yes, a lot.

1214
01:22:20,782 --> 01:22:22,032
Making progress?

1215
01:22:22,328 --> 01:22:23,578
Almost finished.

1216
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,086
Great! I'll go.

1217
01:22:25,328 --> 01:22:27,102
See you later?
- See you later.

1218
01:22:33,895 --> 01:22:36,591
You make me lose my head.
I almost forgot my bag!

1219
01:23:34,875 --> 01:23:36,062
Well?

1220
01:23:36,133 --> 01:23:38,929
She got into a Cadillac and...
- Why didn't you follow her?

1221
01:23:39,071 --> 01:23:41,194
Because the Cadillac blocked the way...

1222
01:23:41,265 --> 01:23:43,601
Listen, Jerome. Go back to the office
and wait for my call.

1223
01:23:43,672 --> 01:23:47,523
I'll do that.
I think it's the best I can do.

1224
01:24:01,854 --> 01:24:03,257
Where's my wife?
- I don't know.

1225
01:24:03,327 --> 01:24:05,010
Where's Olga?
- She left right after you.

1226
01:24:05,081 --> 01:24:06,198
Your wife phoned her.

1227
01:24:06,269 --> 01:24:07,768
I swear we tried to stop her.

1228
01:24:08,909 --> 01:24:12,674
What a bunch of idiots! Where are they?
- The cops! - Huh?

1229
01:24:27,456 --> 01:24:28,885
Let's stop playing.

1230
01:24:29,784 --> 01:24:31,971
The women we love are in danger.
Will you help me?

1231
01:24:32,385 --> 01:24:34,760
It would hurt me... to help a cop.

1232
01:24:34,831 --> 01:24:36,053
You know where they are?

1233
01:24:36,123 --> 01:24:38,245
Yes... but I won't tell you.

1234
01:24:38,612 --> 01:24:41,057
With Charlemagne?
- Who?

1235
01:24:41,604 --> 01:24:42,682
Yes.

1236
01:24:45,034 --> 01:24:46,643
3 Glaciere Street

1237
01:24:47,417 --> 01:24:48,604
Wait for me here.

1238
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:53,815
I wanted to keep you out of this
but I'm not sure I can now.

1239
01:24:54,003 --> 01:24:58,284
Look... if I don't call in 30 minutes,
call Inspector Jerome at the station...

1240
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:00,729
Send him to 3 Glaciere Street.

1241
01:25:01,792 --> 01:25:03,174
I'm counting on you.
- Yes.

1242
01:25:05,346 --> 01:25:06,948
Feel better?
- Yes.

1243
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:20,116
There?
- Yes.

1244
01:25:20,428 --> 01:25:22,459
I'll go.
- I'll go, too.

1245
01:25:23,069 --> 01:25:25,936
It's dangerous, you know.
- Yes. But I'm afraid for our girls.

1246
01:25:26,928 --> 01:25:28,108
Right.

1247
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:29,905
Take this.

1248
01:25:31,045 --> 01:25:33,225
And remember:
the police never shoot first.

1249
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,678
And you?
- I have what I need.

1250
01:25:36,053 --> 01:25:37,202
OK.

1251
01:25:38,186 --> 01:25:39,912
Where are the emeralds?

1252
01:25:40,514 --> 01:25:41,756
The real ones!

1253
01:25:41,999 --> 01:25:43,413
I don't know anything!

1254
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:45,131
Don't make me angry, Virginie.

1255
01:25:45,967 --> 01:25:47,155
Screw you!

1256
01:25:50,295 --> 01:25:52,514
Scream if you like.
No one will hear you.

1257
01:25:53,282 --> 01:25:55,243
Go downstairs. We may have visitors.

1258
01:25:55,322 --> 01:25:56,587
I'm not here for anyone.

1259
01:25:58,184 --> 01:26:00,153
She told us all she knows.

1260
01:26:00,395 --> 01:26:01,716
Now it's your turn!

1261
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:05,653
Let me go!

1262
01:26:06,505 --> 01:26:09,786
I'll go inside the house. You hide
in the garden. - Yes.

1263
01:26:09,857 --> 01:26:11,833
Stay there until I call you.
- OK.

1264
01:27:29,707 --> 01:27:31,480
Where's my wife?
- I don't know.

1265
01:27:31,761 --> 01:27:33,902
You're going to talk!
- My shoulder!

1266
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:37,058
Where?!

1267
01:27:37,863 --> 01:27:38,957
Come on.

1268
01:27:45,224 --> 01:27:49,177
Maybe we should enlarge your mouth
to facilitate the conversation.

1269
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:52,253
I've told you all I know.

1270
01:27:52,324 --> 01:27:55,818
OK... Gino, you can start...
very slowly.

1271
01:27:56,186 --> 01:27:58,725
I'll leave.
I can't stand the sight of blood.

1272
01:28:10,769 --> 01:28:11,887
Good evening, Charlemagne.

1273
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:13,188
Good evening, Mr. Inspector.

1274
01:28:13,258 --> 01:28:15,745
Drop the gun and put your hands up.
- That's all?

1275
01:28:19,973 --> 01:28:21,066
Gino...

1276
01:28:21,558 --> 01:28:25,566
Count to three. If the Inspector doesn't
drop his gun, you can start cutting.

1277
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:27,527
If you do that, I'll kill your friend.

1278
01:28:27,598 --> 01:28:29,027
You don't need to bother.

1279
01:28:31,387 --> 01:28:33,136
I abhor incompetents.

1280
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:35,840
Shoot him, Jean!
Won't worry about me!

1281
01:28:36,113 --> 01:28:37,402
Drop your gun.

1282
01:28:42,137 --> 01:28:43,277
Go on.

1283
01:28:46,207 --> 01:28:47,301
Go on.

1284
01:28:56,004 --> 01:28:57,785
You took me for a ride.

1285
01:28:58,066 --> 01:28:59,715
No, Jean. No!

1286
01:29:00,175 --> 01:29:02,651
You must have really laughed
when I married you.

1287
01:29:03,128 --> 01:29:04,175
No, Jean.

1288
01:29:04,293 --> 01:29:05,848
Shut up. You disgust me.

1289
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:09,012
So, Mr. Inspector...

1290
01:29:09,473 --> 01:29:10,926
Where are the real stones?

1291
01:29:11,863 --> 01:29:13,168
In a safe at the police station.

1292
01:29:13,965 --> 01:29:15,051
I have the receipt with me.

1293
01:29:23,051 --> 01:29:26,535
Boss, if he's here,
the police will be here soon.

1294
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:28,308
Yes, you're right.

1295
01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:30,454
Are we done?

1296
01:29:30,525 --> 01:29:33,348
If you have any last words
for your relatives, say them now.

1297
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:35,557
We're leaving.

1298
01:29:35,753 --> 01:29:38,651
Watch the Inspector. I'll be back soon.
I have things to do.

1299
01:29:39,987 --> 01:29:42,581
You know me, boss. I'm a real nurse.

1300
01:29:48,034 --> 01:29:49,182
Are you happy now?

1301
01:29:50,534 --> 01:29:51,667
Nice adventure, eh?

1302
01:29:52,299 --> 01:29:53,461
Like in the movies.

1303
01:29:54,917 --> 01:29:57,581
Don't cry. No time for that.

1304
01:29:58,979 --> 01:30:03,323
Jean... I beg your forgiveness.
- This isn't the time.

1305
01:30:04,034 --> 01:30:07,284
I didn't know about the gems.
- I don't believe you.

1306
01:30:07,589 --> 01:30:09,815
Why should I lie before I die?

1307
01:30:09,995 --> 01:30:11,596
She's right. She didn't know.

1308
01:30:12,143 --> 01:30:13,542
Nobody knew.

1309
01:30:13,768 --> 01:30:14,964
You won't believe me?

1310
01:30:15,901 --> 01:30:17,464
I don't know. I'm lost now.

1311
01:30:19,190 --> 01:30:20,612
Tell me what happened.

1312
01:30:21,753 --> 01:30:24,542
You don't mind?
- No, I've got my paper to read.

1313
01:30:32,604 --> 01:30:35,221
Time to call the police.
- Yes.

1314
01:30:35,557 --> 01:30:37,417
They'll go easy on us...

1315
01:30:37,870 --> 01:30:39,940
but it's still jail
until we're legal age.

1316
01:30:40,408 --> 01:30:41,675
We'll meet when we get out.

1317
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:43,135
That's right.

1318
01:30:43,214 --> 01:30:44,440
Let's go then.

1319
01:30:47,315 --> 01:30:48,471
Pierrot...

1320
01:30:49,081 --> 01:30:50,565
Give me a magic kiss.

1321
01:30:52,807 --> 01:30:54,440
Maybe it will all work out.

1322
01:31:01,409 --> 01:31:02,617
There...

1323
01:31:03,188 --> 01:31:05,446
I hoped after I returned the camera...

1324
01:31:05,925 --> 01:31:07,534
I could live in peace with you.

1325
01:31:08,276 --> 01:31:09,346
Is that all?

1326
01:31:09,925 --> 01:31:12,526
Yes! I beg you to forgive me!

1327
01:31:13,464 --> 01:31:16,245
I took it... and I lied...

1328
01:31:16,917 --> 01:31:18,346
because I love you.

1329
01:31:18,885 --> 01:31:20,395
And I love you...

1330
01:31:20,465 --> 01:31:21,659
I don't care about the rest.

1331
01:31:23,089 --> 01:31:25,104
Too bad we have to die now.

1332
01:31:25,214 --> 01:31:26,300
Yes.

1333
01:31:28,667 --> 01:31:29,893
May I kiss my wife?

1334
01:31:30,182 --> 01:31:31,956
Alright but no tricks.

1335
01:31:44,579 --> 01:31:45,712
Look...

1336
01:31:51,962 --> 01:31:53,311
Keep him busy.

1337
01:31:54,832 --> 01:31:55,957
Goodbye, Jean!

1338
01:31:56,512 --> 01:31:57,746
Goodbye, my love.

1339
01:32:10,621 --> 01:32:13,574
Van Mechlen Will Play
For France Against Spain

1340
01:32:13,691 --> 01:32:15,697
To read this before I die!

1341
01:32:15,768 --> 01:32:16,853
What?

1342
01:32:16,924 --> 01:32:19,222
Van Mechlen [a Belgian] 
playing on the French team.

1343
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,457
The worst possible news
on my last night alive!

1344
01:32:21,528 --> 01:32:23,824
What's wrong with him
playing on the team?

1345
01:32:23,895 --> 01:32:27,160
He can't play soccer. He's a clown.
- What are you talking about?

1346
01:32:27,254 --> 01:32:30,152
You know how many times he
scored last week? - I'm not interested.

1347
01:32:30,223 --> 01:32:32,098
Five goals!
And he's not a soccer player?

1348
01:32:32,169 --> 01:32:34,316
Five goals. And who was playing with him?

1349
01:32:34,387 --> 01:32:35,793
Three French players...

1350
01:32:35,863 --> 01:32:39,351
Of course... with their help, he just
has to kick the ball...

1351
01:32:39,422 --> 01:32:42,183
at the right time!

1352
01:32:42,254 --> 01:32:45,527
A guy like him needs no help!

1353
01:32:50,191 --> 01:32:52,331
Open the shutters and call Loulou!
Hurry! Hurry!

1354
01:32:59,496 --> 01:33:01,511
Loulou! Loulou!

1355
01:33:01,996 --> 01:33:03,152
I'm coming!

1356
01:33:08,512 --> 01:33:09,707
Don't move.

1357
01:33:09,902 --> 01:33:11,488
All of you up against the wall.

1358
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:16,694
I'll miss you.

1359
01:33:16,765 --> 01:33:17,819
Hands up!

1360
01:33:18,170 --> 01:33:19,483
Shoot, Loulou! Shoot!

1361
01:33:25,171 --> 01:33:27,084
Get him on the way out!
- I'm going!

1362
01:33:27,319 --> 01:33:28,616
Bravo, Loulou!

1363
01:33:34,327 --> 01:33:35,444
Hands up!

1364
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,108
Don't move.

1365
01:33:45,007 --> 01:33:46,256
Come downstairs.

1366
01:33:59,378 --> 01:34:01,331
That's all. Just a habit.

1367
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:03,132
Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

1368
01:34:03,202 --> 01:34:04,690
You're not hurt?
- No, no, no.

1369
01:34:05,261 --> 01:34:07,581
You can lower your arms now.
- Thank you very much.

1370
01:34:08,246 --> 01:34:11,355
Don't worry. It's not even loaded.
- Really!?

1371
01:34:14,182 --> 01:34:15,796
Little punk!
I know him from somewhere.

1372
01:34:15,866 --> 01:34:17,011
Don't touch anything!

1373
01:34:17,082 --> 01:34:18,839
This one could be loaded.

1374
01:34:19,308 --> 01:34:20,996
I know you from somewhere.

1375
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:23,472
Of course. At Raphael's this afternoon.

1376
01:34:23,566 --> 01:34:25,550
Right... of course...

1377
01:34:26,597 --> 01:34:29,136
And your name is?
- Charlemagne.

1378
01:34:30,946 --> 01:34:32,121
That's very nice.

1379
01:34:41,972 --> 01:34:44,042
You'll be bored without me.

1380
01:34:49,448 --> 01:34:50,488
Is he injured?

1381
01:34:50,559 --> 01:34:52,011
I just put him to sleep.

1382
01:34:52,371 --> 01:34:53,910
Very smart. He just saved our lives.

1383
01:34:54,035 --> 01:34:55,730
How could I know that?

1384
01:34:57,261 --> 01:34:58,727
Feeling better?

1385
01:34:59,621 --> 01:35:00,777
You were great.

1386
01:35:00,996 --> 01:35:02,089
Jean!

1387
01:35:02,738 --> 01:35:04,790
Jean! Jean, are you hurt?
- No.

1388
01:35:06,222 --> 01:35:07,503
I was so scared, Loulou.

1389
01:35:08,371 --> 01:35:09,613
Oh, my Loulou!

1390
01:35:10,613 --> 01:35:12,996
How do you feel?
- Better now.

1391
01:35:13,871 --> 01:35:15,480
That was a close one.

1392
01:35:15,644 --> 01:35:18,315
The Inspector saved your life.
- Thank you, sir.

1393
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:20,691
I only did my duty.
