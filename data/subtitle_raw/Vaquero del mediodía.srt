00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:41,542
MY FLAME KNOWS HOW TO SWIM IN COLD WATER
AND HOW TO LOSE RESPECT FOR HARSH LAWS

00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,210
MISSING POET
FAIR SKIN - 53 YEARS OLD - INFORMATION

3
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,810
People tried to find me too.

4
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,396
My people looked for me

5
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,899
for eight years.

6
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,820
They knew nothing about me
for eight years.

7
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:56,116
Do you know
how long Samuel has been missing?

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,325
-Tell me.
-The man I mentioned.

9
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,910
-Tell me.
-Eight years too.

10
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,704
Some people told me,
"Stop looking, man, you won't find him."

11
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,165
-No, man, of course you can find him.
-What do you think?

12
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,127
You know,
I managed to stay under the radar

13
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,129
for almost 16 years.

14
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:14,009
But now they know I'm alive.

15
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:26,146
ANNEX
…FOR DATA COLLECTION…

16
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:32,527
I came to file a missing person's report,
a friend of mine's missing.

17
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,238
-What's your name?
-Diego Osorno.

18
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,740
I've been looking for him by my own means.
I'm a journalist.

19
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,783
MISSING POET

20
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,160
I even hired a detective.

21
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,370
Honestly, this doesn't look like
a detective's office.

22
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,329
PRIVATE DETECTIVE

23
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,873
That's what most of my clients say.

24
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,876
I'd like you to help me,

25
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,254
I'm looking for this poet…

26
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,174
His name is Samuel David Noyola García.

27
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,178
He was born on 8th February, 1964.

28
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,137
PERSONAL INFORMATION

29
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,806
-Do you know his marital status?
-He's single.

30
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,226
I don't fully trust
the work of the DA's office.

31
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,855
I'm under the impression
that they'll only look for a dead body,

32
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,190
they won't look for him alive.

33
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:13,067
-I mean, he <i>could</i> be alive.
-Yes, of course.

34
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,195
Sorry, how old would he be now?

35
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,864
He'd be 53, right? Yeah.

36
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,073
Was he your friend?

37
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,033
-Yes.
-Okay.

38
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,078
I met him after a poetry reading

39
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,914
by José Emilio Pacheco at Casa Magna.

40
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,917
I used to be a poet too.

41
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,296
A lousy, immature poet.

42
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:36,216
When I met him, I realized
I had no talent whatsoever for poetry

43
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,094
because <i>he</i> is a truly amazing poet.

44
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,721
How long has he been missing?

45
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,389
About eight years.

46
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,352
Eight years. Do you have
any more data? What did you find out?

47
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,943
He lived on the streets sometimes.

48
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,445
He decided not to have a home.

49
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,615
It's not that he didn't have
a place to stay,

50
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,827
but he didn't want to stay in one place

51
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:07,077
because he thought
that went against his vision

52
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:08,457
of poetry and life.

53
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,294
His only guiding light
was Nobel prizewinner Octavio Paz,

54
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:19,717
but, apart from him, he refused
to be subdued by any group or person.

55
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,469
THANK YOU IN ADVANCE
FOR READING THESE LINES.

56
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:25,557
Okay. I think the posters are a good idea.

57
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,310
We'll put them on the walls, we'll look
for him here and in Mexico City.

58
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,023
I have the feeling
that he wanted to get lost.

59
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,735
He might come back on his own,
we don't know.

60
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,112
That's what poets are like.

61
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,785
Does he have any nicknames?

62
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,038
Some poets used to call him
"Midday Cowboy."

63
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,471
We're looking for this man.

64
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,766
We were told he used to work around here,
outside this bar.

65
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,980
I remember when his book came out.
It was an astonishing moment.

66
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:14,981
WRITER AND FRIEND

67
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,942
You felt you were
in the presence of a poet.

68
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,153
I went to the store
to buy credit for my phone

69
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,240
and I saw him sitting outside,
but he seemed lost…

70
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,450
-Did he?
-He was out of it.

71
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,163
-What is his name?
-Samuel Noyola.

72
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:34,334
His face looks familiar.
Some time ago, I used to get drunk a lot.

73
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,086
Our main concern is
to find out if he's alive.

74
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,215
"Like a bee in heat, I fluttered around

75
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,885
towards the loneliness
of a darker garden."

76
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,763
"I fell for so long,
until vertigo made a martyr of me."

77
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,226
"And then I got lost forever
in the heart attack that love is."

78
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,855
-Did you like it?
-Yeah, it's quite cool.

79
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,232
One more?

80
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,611
He has a gift.
I mean, it's a gift from God, right?

81
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,071
Either you have it or you don't.

82
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,908
That man's a good writer
because there are…

83
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,244
many things in there
that make you think.

84
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:14,458
Many things that you can't even describe.

85
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,671
Very cool. I hope you'll find him.

86
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,923
Someone who looks similar to him
passed by 15 days ago.

87
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,967
-Right.
-He's always barefoot,

88
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,680
but that time
he was wearing plastic bags on his feet.

89
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,390
This man thinks he might be Samuel.

90
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,394
Yeah, he might be wandering around here.

91
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,483
Suddenly, he started reciting

92
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,694
the fifth canto
of <i>The Divine Comedy</i> in Italian.

93
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:43,653
WRITER AND FRIEND

94
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,737
The whole thing.

95
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,574
So I told him,
"Samuel, you speak Italian!"

96
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,326
"No," he answered,
"I just know Dante's work."

97
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:53,913
-He's not here now.
-That bastard…

98
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,582
That is another one,
but he's bad-tempered.

99
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,376
To me,
what's most fascinating about Samuel

100
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,714
is neither the fact that we can't find him
nor the life he led.

101
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:06,176
To me, what's most fascinating
about Samuel is his poetry.

102
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,054
Where are you from?

103
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,475
From here. I'm from here.

104
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,810
Are you using the past tense
because you haven't seen him

105
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,187
in a long time,

106
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,940
or because you think, like many others,
that he's dead?

107
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:26,321
Well, the last time I saw him,
he was lying on the street…

108
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,115
We were told he usually roams around here.

109
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,742
-Maybe you saw him?
-Have a good look at it.

110
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:33,871
He was a poet.

111
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,623
-Well, he <i>is</i> a poet.
-His name's Samuel.

112
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,959
He was wearing rags. He was so filthy.

113
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,422
His nails were pitch black,
he had no teeth…

114
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:49,386
his hair was completely matted.
He was half asleep, half drunk…

115
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:55,100
I saw death in him then, to be honest.

116
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:04,859
"Death is drunk
and runs aground at 7:19 a.m."

117
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,236
POET

118
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,697
Not only will we get life drunk.

119
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,034
We'll get death drunk too.

120
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,875
I don't think he goes to bars.
Does he drink?

121
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,462
It's a possibility. We've been looking
for him in some bars too.

122
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,630
Damn…

123
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,758
As any other nomad,
Samuel lived at everyone's home.

124
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:29,843
POET AND FRIEND

125
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,220
Everywhere but with you two

126
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,514
because your wife wouldn't allow it.

127
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,350
In your case,
your sisters wouldn't allow it.

128
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,603
Anyone who tells you, "He lived with me,"
don't believe them.

129
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,190
He slept wherever night overtook him.

130
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,902
What I first heard about him was…

131
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:48,862
JOURNALIST AND CRITIC

132
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:51,490
…that he was very interested in poetry

133
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,660
and that he had an extraordinary memory.

134
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,704
This portrait…

135
00:08:58,789 --> 00:08:59,665
No, brother.

136
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,918
We're talking about 1982.
How old was Samuel then?

137
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,963
-Was he… 19 years old?
-He was 19.

138
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,340
Samuel was…

139
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,385
well, part of our family.

140
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,772
There's a man here
who really looks like this dude, yeah,

141
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:26,024
he wears cargo pants.

142
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,735
Yeah, cargo pants. And he's thin.

143
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,613
He has a really small waist.

144
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:37,744
You can see this dude is hiding something,

145
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,164
he has a look
as if he were mocking someone.

146
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,875
What we could see in Samuel
from the very beginning

147
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,086
was that he was…

148
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,045
POET AND FRIEND

149
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,005
…very, very well read.

150
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,051
That dude doesn't come from the streets.

151
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:56,305
You can see this guy
has the evil inside of him.

152
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,309
He's doing bad deeds,
you can see it in his eyes.

153
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,769
You can see evil in his eyes.

154
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,941
I mean, he seems very focused
on doing something.

155
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,987
He's very focused on doing something
to mess with someone.

156
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,865
CASE REPORT
DISAPPEARANCE - REPORT DATE

157
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:16,908
He's a poet.

158
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,952
Oh, man…

159
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:22,581
I think Samuel worked on his verses…

160
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,125
by mapping them.

161
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,918
I've seen that dude.

162
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,837
There are so many men there, man…

163
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:32,465
When he suddenly finished
two or three verses,

164
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,968
he would repeat them to you
two, three, many times.

165
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,095
STIRRED UP BY THE FIRE OF A BEER,
I WRITE

166
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,889
And then he chained them together.

167
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,850
-No…
-He looks like someone I know.

168
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:44,770
He looks like the guy nicknamed Barrio.

169
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,730
He looks like Barrio.

170
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:48,690
POET AND FRIEND

171
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,942
He was influenced by the poets
from the Spanish Golden Age…

172
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,026
-Yes.
-…who were

173
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,195
precise in the sound and meter
of their poems.

174
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,114
I WRITE THIS POEM WITHOUT A GUARDIAN MUSE

175
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,991
TRUSTING THAT INSPIRATION
IS A THING OF THE PAST,

176
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,326
STIRRED UP BY THE FIRE OF A BEER,
I WRITE FOR A NAMELESS MUSE

177
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,287
We use many… Excuse me.

178
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,164
We use many nicknames around here.

179
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,834
Barrio, with all due respect,

180
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,795
looks very similar
to that person you're looking for.

181
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,046
…at that corner, over there.

182
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,466
-Around that corner.
-Wait. If you want, we can go there.

183
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,718
-Let's go, yeah.
-I can go with you.

184
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,344
Samuel was a wild artist.

185
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,304
Excuse me.

186
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:23,100
He was like a bundle of instincts

187
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,227
walking around the street.

188
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:28,188
Is he a college graduate or…?

189
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,899
Well, he's a poet. He… reads a lot.

190
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:33,193
Oh, yeah, that's the guy!

191
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:37,238
Because Barrio's always "poeting" me.

192
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,949
He never had a proper trade,

193
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:43,828
a normal way to earn his living.

194
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,080
What do you mean by "poeting"?

195
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:52,212
Well, he's always telling me stuff like,
"Baby, honey, you're so fine."

196
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:56,758
That man is quite a poet.
My respects to him.

197
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:57,884
He's had many girlfriends.

198
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:02,138
Of course! With the loquacity
of a poet, who wouldn't fall at his feet?

199
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,642
I know some women
who were very beautiful at the time

200
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,770
and who were Samuel's girlfriends,
at least for two or three days.

201
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:12,900
And that made him even more loathsome.

202
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,861
This is my trunk of memories.

203
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,697
Samuel must be under the letter S.

204
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,413
FOR A NAMELESS MUSE

205
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:37,132
STIRRED UP BY THE FIRE OF A BEER,
I WRITE FOR A NAMELESS MUSE

206
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:40,468
TRUSTING THAT INSPIRATION
IS A THING OF THE PAST,

207
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,680
I WRITE THIS POEM WITHOUT A GUARDIAN MUSE

208
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,026
…IS A THING OF THE PAST

209
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,236
I'd better close it.

210
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,405
So the rest won't get scared away.

211
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,700
"Faithfulness killed the cat."

212
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:07,037
"Better again than sorry."

213
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,082
His drawings.

214
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,252
Do you understand it?

215
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,422
Samuel is the arcanum number 0,
he's the Fool,

216
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,882
the nomad, the traveler.

217
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:19,841
JOURNALIST AND FRIEND

218
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:23,178
He's crazy,
but he's looking up at the sky.

219
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:26,222
He roams the world along with the wind.

220
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,560
He has no apparent course or goal,
but he's looking up at the sky.

221
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,519
THE FOOL

222
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:32,771
He's looking at a star.

223
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,192
I met Samuel 32 years ago.

224
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,278
Gosh, that photo… Don't mention my age.

225
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,613
Samuel was very young.

226
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:42,572
SENATOR AND MUSE

227
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,200
He was just 20, 21 years old.

228
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,454
He wouldn't talk about some things.
We didn't really know…

229
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,497
WRITER AND FORMER PARTNER

230
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,833
…what his family was like
or where he had studied.

231
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,253
Yeah, that was Sam.
Yes, it was around that time.

232
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,755
PSYCHOTHERAPIST AND FORMER PARTNER

233
00:13:58,839 --> 00:13:59,715
It <i>is</i> him!

234
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:01,300
Look.

235
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,970
-It's him, but younger.
-Yeah, look. Come here.

236
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:06,638
Yeah, but filthy, look.

237
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:10,100
-He's a very important poet.
-Yeah, he's a very important poet.

238
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:14,521
He told me so. He said, "I'm a poet."
And I said, "Yeah, you are."

239
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:18,191
"But you are you drunk."
And he replied, "No, I'm not drunk."

240
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:21,361
He said, "I <i>am</i> a poet,"
and I replied, "Yeah, I believe you."

241
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:25,365
He chats a lot with--
He always sits and rests here.

242
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,242
We talk a lot.

243
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,327
-That's Barrio.
-He's Barrio, you shout, "Barrio!"

244
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:31,079
and he answers, "What's up, man?"

245
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,123
-And when he's mad…
-He tells you to fuck off.

246
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,374
That's his security blanket.

247
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,376
This is a meme they made…

248
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,794
-Of Barrio.
-Of Barrio.

249
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,505
The one we're looking for is a poet.

250
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:43,091
TRUST YOUR SECURITY BLANKET - BARRIO

251
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,138
He always wore the same pair of jeans,
and his sneakers always looked impeccable.

252
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:53,143
I also remember
he used to wear a long-sleeved T-shirt.

253
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,103
A burgundy one.

254
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:00,817
And he had a full head of hair
with perfectly defined curls.

255
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:05,405
This is one of Samuel's curls.

256
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:09,367
He was very proud of his work.

257
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:14,914
He was quite aware
that his poetry was elevated and worthy.

258
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:18,460
Almost all of us were running
from one place to another,

259
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:21,379
teaching
or writing articles for magazines,

260
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:25,341
but Samuel
was completely devoted to poetry.

261
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,470
We never knew what Samuel's job was.
Samuel was a poet.

262
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:32,057
Look. "Dear poet Martha,

263
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,729
maybe I'll come back to sleep,
with the gods' and the drunks' favor."

264
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,483
"Best regards
from this neurotic and compulsive man."

265
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:42,901
"Amen."

266
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,487
What is a neurotic
and compulsive man like?

267
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,071
Well, to me, he's beautiful.

268
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:52,660
I mean, poets have the right
to be whatever they please, right?

269
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,245
He was just himself.

270
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,414
I have a strong character
and I don't give in to anyone.

271
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,750
So I wouldn't give in to him either.

272
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:02,003
Just because you're cute,
have light eyes and write beautifully?

273
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,964
No, honey, of course not.

274
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:09,469
Ever since we first met,
Barrio and I are always arguing.

275
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,722
Sometimes I tell him,
"Hey, bring the moonshine!"

276
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,766
He sometimes says,
"I don't have any damn moonshine!"

277
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:17,852
In truth, I was his friend,

278
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:22,398
a friend who always opened her doors
to him and also protected him.

279
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,027
I was his confidante,
he would tell me many things.

280
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,572
Well, some things, because I know
he didn't talk about everything.

281
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,116
He kept some things to himself.

282
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,869
Those that hurt him, most likely.

283
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,870
It's not an easy book.

284
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,330
TO MARCELA GUERRA: NUMBER AND MEANING

285
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,291
Look, instead of his photo,
he put a drawing of himself.

286
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,919
-It doesn't look like Samuel, does it?
-Yeah, it does.

287
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,045
-Does it?
-Yeah.

288
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,799
One day he came to my office and asked,
"Which country would you like to visit?"

289
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,511
This was 32 years ago, or even earlier.

290
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,680
I thought about it for a bit
and then said, "Egypt."

291
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,183
"Why?" he asked.

292
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:02,564
"Because I want to see the Great Sphinx,"
I answered.

293
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:05,817
And he said, "<i>You</i> are the sphinx."

294
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,570
And then he wrote the poem
about the sphinx.

295
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:11,364
I mean, he didn't write it in front of me,
but here it is.

296
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,449
Let's see it.

297
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:17,704
Let me find it.

298
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:24,043
"I know you are the sphinx, the dream
that scares people with its doves."

299
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,795
"You are the smiling eye,

300
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,882
with your theory
about aesthetics and conversations."

301
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,388
"The woman who fires with her laughter
the ancient crossbow of the senses."

302
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,015
"I know you are the sphinx,

303
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:40,101
a sphinx muted by her own beauty."

304
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:44,314
"The question of the self
before an amazed mirror."

305
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:47,359
THE WOMAN WHO FIRES WITH HER LAUGHTER
THE ANCIENT CROSSBOW OF THE SENSES

306
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,446
What was it like to live
with someone like Samuel?

307
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,117
I was very at ease. I have to admit
that he always came home to sleep.

308
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,370
If he was going to come home late,
he'd call me to let me know.

309
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,498
We were going to get married.

310
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,751
-He wanted--
-We were going to have kids.

311
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:12,217
So do you think he was tamed?

312
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,219
I don't know if that's the right word,

313
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:17,890
but someone like him,
who led such a wild life…

314
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,393
It's him, isn't it?

315
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,438
Good evening, sir, sorry to bother you.

316
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,398
We're--

317
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:31,402
-We're looking for a person.
-Yeah, tell me, what…?

318
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,947
A lot of people told us,
"This man is Barrio,"

319
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,615
so we were looking for you and--

320
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,076
I'm Barrio, but I'm quite macho.

321
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:43,207
This is a wisp of Samuel Noyola's hair,

322
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,960
which he gave me on March 30th, 1985.

323
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,422
Why?

324
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,924
His name is Samuel Noyola.
Because he's missing.

325
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,927
Samuel "Sabiola"?
No, I'm Arturo Juárez Franco.

326
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,222
-No, but it's that guy.
-So much fuss over this man?

327
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,350
Dust of celestial magic.

328
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,936
This is for Forensics.

329
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,772
Here it is, for…

330
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:08,357
Okay.

331
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:12,735
Thank you very much.
So you said this was given to you…

332
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,780
-That same person.
-…by Samuel's partner.

333
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,407
-Former partner.
-Samuel's former partner.

334
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,118
Where do you think he is?

335
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:22,496
Where do I think he is?

336
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:27,918
MARCH 30TH, 1985

337
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,465
I don't like to talk about possibilities

338
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:36,342
and say, "Yes, we'll find him in 15 days,"

339
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,887
or "No, he'll never be found."
It's not accurate like that.

340
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,555
I think no one can give such answers,

341
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,640
we're talking about people
who can move around,

342
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,852
who can travel from one place to another,

343
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:47,813
even from one country to another.

344
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:52,776
SPECIALIZED TEAM FOR IMMEDIATE SEARCHES
MISSING PERSON: SAMUEL DAVID NOYOLA GARCÍA

345
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,861
I want to talk to my brother,
he's in the United--

346
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:56,404
Give me his number, we'll call him.

347
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:59,407
A real poet, to me and to many…

348
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:03,662
A real poet
is someone who feels hunger, thirst, cold.

349
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:06,498
Barrio…

350
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:13,797
Pastor…

351
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,930
-I'm Hernan. Hey…
-<i>Hi, Carlos.</i>

352
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,851
-<i>What's up?</i>
-Hey, well…

353
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,398
Someone who feels abandonment.

354
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,900
He is a real poet.

355
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,568
Not only does he have the spirit
of a poet,

356
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,862
but he also has the talent of a poet.

357
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:38,864
<i>What's up?</i>

358
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:45,495
What was Samuel?

359
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,707
A man touched by God.

360
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,425
<i>Oh, God be with you.</i>

361
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,768
He's my brother,
but he doesn't speak Spanish anymore.

362
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:13,649
I've been living in trains
for about 20 years…

363
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,194
You're a cowboy.

364
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,281
The poet we're looking for
goes by the name "Midday Cowboy."

365
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:52,437
Hi, friends.

366
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,314
I'm Daffy Duck.

367
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,443
You want me to keep reading, right?

368
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:05,450
"Death is drunk
and runs aground at 7:19 a.m."

369
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:13,458
We were roaming around at night,

370
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:16,920
following secret signs
left for us by… someone.

371
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:17,921
PRODUCER AND FRIEND

372
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:21,592
And Samuel said,
"This is telling us something."

373
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:33,061
He sees this. Death.

374
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:34,479
The skull.

375
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,397
Three, two, one.

376
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:39,943
Good evening, Samuel Noyola.
What are you presenting us today?

377
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:42,028
<i>Tequila con calavera</i>. What is it about?

378
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,738
It's about my impressions of the city.

379
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,199
Here there are these… masks.

380
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,785
It was like a tour that became a ritual.

381
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:55,334
It's about my impressions of the desert.

382
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:59,295
See?
Little weird things that suddenly appear.

383
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,714
This one is incredible.

384
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:07,262
It's about moods.

385
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,350
Yes, he'd suddenly break down in tears.

386
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,769
We respected the fact
that he had those moments.

387
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:18,273
"Okay, he has these strong feelings,
that's all."

388
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:21,777
"There's nothing we can…"
So we kept silent.

389
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:27,324
We let him be, feeling and suffering,
in that silence.

390
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:46,634
And then, it was over.

391
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,846
We'd keep walking. No big deal.

392
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:57,520
Why <i>Tequila con calavera</i>,
"tequila with a skull"?

393
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:01,316
It's like death and parties.

394
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,402
Why bringing death and parties together?

395
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,613
Because that's the image of the calendar.

396
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:09,950
-Do you want to add anything else?
-Mmm… no. Cheers!

397
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,707
That time, Samuel was really stubborn.

398
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:22,045
"Rogelio Cuéllar lives near here.
He's a photographer."

399
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:24,881
"He has to take your picture
because you're a writer."

400
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:28,718
And Samuel insisted I had to wear a tie.

401
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:29,928
I don't know why.

402
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:38,186
They came here one morning,
and Armando Alanís was wearing a tie.

403
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,521
And Samuel's at the back.

404
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:40,647
PHOTOGRAPHER AND NEIGHBOR

405
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,901
And Samuel is at the back.
He's looking at this sphere.

406
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:55,412
Around that time,
<i>Vuelta</i> magazine was launched.

407
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:00,959
I started working at <i>Vuelta</i> magazine
in 1990.

408
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,754
It was founded by Octavio Paz.

409
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:08,758
<i>In 1990, Octavio Paz</i>
<i>became the first Mexican</i>

410
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,512
<i>to be awarded</i>
<i>the Nobel Prize in Literature.</i>

411
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:15,306
I used to produce shows,

412
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,392
so I had a huge address book

413
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:23,022
with the phone numbers of intellectuals,
musicians and painters.

414
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,942
And I had Octavio Paz's number.

415
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,569
Samuel saw I had Octavio's number,

416
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:30,197
so he took the phone,
left and called him up.

417
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:36,286
<i>Hi. We're not available at the moment.</i>
<i>Please call again later.</i>

418
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,580
He came back and told me,
"He extended me an invitation."

419
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:43,168
I don't remember if he called Paz
"the master," "the boss" or whatever.

420
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:45,378
So I said, "Cool,"
and we just kept on drinking.

421
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,047
I didn't pay much attention to it…

422
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:54,262
Octavio Paz aroused great admiration,

423
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:58,391
and his magazine attracted young poets.

424
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:00,351
PRODUCER: SAMUEL NOYOLA

425
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,396
I had the chance to meet Samuel.

426
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,065
Samuel was like a hurricane.

427
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:10,069
He'd enter the <i>Vuelta</i> offices
and cause a stir.

428
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:11,237
JOURNALIST AND CRITIC

429
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,156
Samuel's arrival would be quite an event.

430
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:24,835
He was so irritating.
He was a professional nuisance.

431
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,504
But I was very pleased to see

432
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:32,008
that his first poem
to be published in <i>Vuelta</i> magazine

433
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:36,262
was dedicated
to Octavio Paz's beautiful blue eyes.

434
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:40,141
At the time, that was a scandal
for young poets,

435
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:44,729
who thought you're supposed
to keep a critical distance,

436
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:49,150
but he said, "No, I don't care,

437
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:50,527
he has beautiful eyes,

438
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:54,448
so I'll write a poem
about Octavio Paz's beautiful blue eyes."

439
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:58,619
But Octavio Paz had gray eyes.

440
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,996
Yeah…

441
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,457
At first, people admired his position.

442
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,334
Well, it depended on whom you asked.

443
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:09,337
If you asked José Jaime, he'd tell you,
"Look at where Samuel is,

444
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:10,964
he's now by Paz's side."

445
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:13,842
"He's seated at the right hand of God."

446
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:15,468
Or something like that.

447
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:19,347
But if you asked those
who considered themselves his detractors,

448
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:21,141
his rivals, they'd say, "Nah,

449
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:23,810
most surely he's fucking Paz
and his wife Marie Jo too."

450
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,855
Since Noyola wasn't particularly cautious.

451
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:27,939
WRITER AND FRIEND

452
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:31,818
He'd show up at Octavio Paz's house
uninvited, even when Marie Jo was there.

453
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:39,617
-<i>Hello?</i>
-<i>Hi. We're not available at the moment.</i>

454
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,995
-<i>Please call again later.</i>
-Hello? Hi?

455
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,831
-<i>Who is it?</i>
-How do you do, Marie Jo?

456
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,958
Octavio Paz was working at his office,

457
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:49,669
and Samuel looked at him from afar
and told her,

458
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:52,922
"Look, he's working,
we mustn't interrupt him."

459
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,507
He was quite reckless.

460
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:57,761
Once Samuel told me, "Everyone thinks

461
00:27:57,845 --> 00:28:00,805
I had threesomes
with Marie Jo and Paz. Whatever…"

462
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:05,685
"No way! Paz and I
had a father-son kind of relationship."

463
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,896
He'd get very angry about that.

464
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,940
But there were strong rumors about it.

465
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,157
It's Diego, Marie Jo.

466
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:20,992
You told me to call you now

467
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:22,953
to talk about Samuel Noyola.

468
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,582
<i>Yes, sure, what happened?</i>

469
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:32,796
Marie Jo, did Octavio Paz see Samuel
as a real poet, as an important one?

470
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,672
<i>Yes, sure.</i>

471
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:41,263
<i>He said he could see</i>
<i>certain poet qualities in Samuel.</i>

472
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:43,265
<i>Yes, he used to tell him that.</i>

473
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,604
At some point,
Octavio Paz told him, "Look,

474
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:54,818
you should listen to your talent
more than to your personality."

475
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,406
Since he saw Samuel used to drink a lot,
he told him,

476
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:04,411
"Have your drinking under control,
and I'll be your patron."

477
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:07,997
I think what Octavio Paz saw in Samuel

478
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:11,376
was a reflection of himself in his youth.

479
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:16,589
In a way, Octavio Paz identified with him.

480
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,634
Do you know why?
Because Samuel was the only one

481
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:21,136
who was straightforward with him.

482
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,596
For instance,

483
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:27,475
we were in a class
analyzing the poem <i>Blanco</i>.

484
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,562
So I was there with all my classmates,

485
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:32,605
a bunch of pseudointellectuals.

486
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:34,566
I was the youngest one there.

487
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,068
Octavio Paz
was at the back of the classroom,

488
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,780
and everyone went,
"In my personal but informed opinion…"

489
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:44,367
And they said
that <i>Blanco</i> was about nothingness,

490
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:47,078
that <i>Blanco</i> was about love.

491
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:51,040
Suddenly, Samuel, in despair,
jumped to the front

492
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:54,336
and, in the most lowbrow tone
you can think of, he said,

493
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:58,590
"No one here
gets the damn point of <i>Blanco</i>!"

494
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:01,634
I mean… "No, <i>Blanco</i> is about semen,

495
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:04,095
it's clearly written
in the first two paragraphs."

496
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:08,559
"But semen is not just semen,
it's the seed of life."

497
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:12,396
He left everyone gaping,

498
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:16,483
and Octavio Paz was so amused and happy.

499
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,780
Octavio Paz adopted Samuel Noyola

500
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:26,618
because of his genius and his abandonment.

501
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:29,913
Samuel Noyola
was always an abandoned child.

502
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,265
I can't see which book is that one
in his hands, if it's his or not.

503
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:51,643
Oh, it's his greatest book,
<i>Tequila con calavera.</i>

504
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:54,813
Octavio Paz called me and said,
"We must publish this book."

505
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:57,649
And if Octavio Paz, the head
of the publishing house,

506
00:30:57,733 --> 00:31:01,277
told you so,
well, you couldn't argue with that.

507
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,572
Everyone really liked the book,

508
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:08,326
and we defended it a lot.
It was heavily criticized by outsiders.

509
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,289
I think those who envied and resented him
couldn't really speak ill of it

510
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:18,795
because he had written
some really good poems.

511
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,756
I didn't know if his poetry was worthy.

512
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,384
Even now, I don't know if it is.

513
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:28,179
But it was our friendship that moved me.

514
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:32,684
He wanted me to be his witness,
he wanted me to watch his every step.

515
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:34,144
He knew I had my camera.

516
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,360
It was all an adventure,
to see what was next,

517
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:44,779
and it almost always ended up badly.

518
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,781
Can you spare a cigarette, sir?

519
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:48,408
Make it two, come on. Please.

520
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:50,660
-What did I tell you, man?
-What? Hi.

521
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:54,080
I told you to stay away, man, leave.
No one invited you, go.

522
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:55,498
What did I tell you?

523
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:57,792
-Which invitation, man?
-What did I tell you, man? Get lost.

524
00:31:57,876 --> 00:31:59,545
What are you talking about?
Which invitation?

525
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:01,797
Which invitation, man?

526
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:04,549
Which invitation? What?

527
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:05,717
We never had a quiet evening.

528
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:08,887
We always ended up fighting,

529
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:11,139
being kicked out of places
or chased by someone.

530
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:15,352
…at the back. Go to the back
and do whatever you do there.

531
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:25,445
Man, what…

532
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:30,450
To you, was Samuel's life
full of light or full of darkness?

533
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:33,203
<i>Full of light, definitely.</i>

534
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:38,709
I think it was here…

535
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:42,045
where I shot that video of Samuel

536
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:45,006
in which I'm telling him to walk
in the middle of the street.

537
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:45,966
Okay, come here.

538
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,722
Follow the middle of the light beam.
To the left.

539
00:32:52,264 --> 00:32:53,890
-More to the left.
-Over there?

540
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:56,976
Sorry, to your-- There!
Go straight ahead.

541
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,564
No, follow the light beam, see?
Can you see the light reflected on…?

542
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:03,358
There, now walk straight to the camera,
come towards me.

543
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:21,168
What does a mountain smell like?
Does it smell like oregano?

544
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:23,587
Does it smell like sweat?

545
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:26,465
There are many sensations involved.

546
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:35,098
Monterrey has the great advantage
of being surrounded by mountains.

547
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:36,808
So there's always a new peak to climb,

548
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:40,228
or a track nobody has followed
for a long time.

549
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:42,814
Have you met any poets here?

550
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:45,859
No, romantic people
are usually not into this.

551
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:48,529
The only one was Samuel.

552
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:58,038
When Samuel was young,
he used to come with me.

553
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,415
MIDDLE SCHOOL NUMBER 10
SEVENTH GRADE

554
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:03,209
He was between 13 and 14 years old.

555
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:05,462
That was one or two years
before he left for Nicaragua.

556
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:07,840
DAVID ALFARO SIQUEIROS SCHOOL
OVERALL AVERAGE: 8.9

557
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:13,595
"What is Samuel's family like?"

558
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:17,057
I should speak in the first person,
and that's…

559
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:19,142
hard for me.

560
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:22,479
I'm 11 years older than Samuel.

561
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,398
We were…

562
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:27,359
nine siblings.

563
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:30,695
My mom and my dad.

564
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,322
MOUNTAINEER AND BROTHER

565
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:33,490
Well…

566
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:36,410
when I was 15,

567
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:37,995
he abandoned us.

568
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:41,081
My youngest brother was one year old.

569
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:43,333
It was really tough.

570
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:47,337
It's hard for me to talk about it.

571
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,228
"Sonnet to celebrate two summits
reached on 6th February,

572
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:06,231
the day my blood reached
the top of the Aconcagua,

573
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:07,983
and Rubén Darío's birthday."

574
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:09,985
"To Héctor Noyola."

575
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:14,697
"You gave me murky baths of icy water

576
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,950
in order to shake off the hiding slumber,

577
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:19,285
through my veins,
the brightness of the daylight

578
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:21,538
was inspiring
an image full of white snow."

579
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:27,961
I LEFT

580
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:31,756
FOLLOWING A FIRESTORM OF VOWELS

581
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,634
YOU WENT TO THE PROUD VERTIGO OF HEIGHT

582
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:38,096
THERE ARE SNOW SWANS
AS WELL AS REAL ONES

583
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:43,810
BECAUSE THE PAGE AND THE SKY ARE DEEP

584
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:46,187
AND A RIVER WITH OTHERWORLDLY STARS

585
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:48,940
THAT VIBRATE WITH THE SILENCE AND THE TEXT

586
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:50,483
WITH OTHERWORLDLY STARS

587
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:51,568
…"and the text."

588
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:55,197
I've read this poem…

589
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:57,616
just twice.

590
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:02,829
Once I reach the third paragraph,
I can't keep reading it anymore.

591
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:11,296
Before he left for Nicaragua,
we had an argument.

592
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:14,007
Which were my mistakes?

593
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:18,637
Up to which point am I responsible
for his tragedy?

594
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:28,646
There's a photo of Samuel
in which he's shirtless.

595
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:32,192
He was always a child. In this photo,
he must have been 16, almost 17.

596
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:33,443
DESIGNER AND PROTECTOR

597
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:34,527
He wasn't a poet then.

598
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:36,029
-No, he wasn't a poet yet.
-Wasn't he?

599
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:47,624
At that time, incidentally,

600
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:50,627
the Nicaraguan revolution
was taking place.

601
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:07,060
One day, a tall guy showed up.

602
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:09,146
He was just a teenager.

603
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:12,482
Or he was just leaving
his teenage years behind.

604
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:15,276
He said he was a visual artist.

605
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,236
SCHOLAR AND PROTECTOR

606
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,322
He didn't tell me he was a poet.

607
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:25,745
Down! Don't lose your positions!

608
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,498
That restlessness
was also characteristic of Samuel.

609
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:32,252
He was a person who was trying
to find meaning in his life.

610
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:34,630
Enemy down!

611
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:42,679
Riot!

612
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:45,348
One fine day,
he decided to go to Nicaragua.

613
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:50,103
IF THE HOMELAND IS SMALL,
YOU DREAM OF IT BIG - RUBÉN DARÍO

614
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:53,148
Samuel didn't have a place to stay.

615
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:55,984
I told him, "Stay at my place, then."

616
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:58,403
Back then, he didn't write.

617
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:01,907
He made book covers and posters.

618
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:05,160
He made the cover

619
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:09,038
for Ernesto Cardenal's book of poetry,
based on Cardenal's hand.

620
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:09,998
Your hand.

621
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,585
-Is that okay?
-Put it in the middle of the page.

622
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:17,214
Press it hard!

623
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:19,091
There.

624
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,472
Samuel was very quiet.

625
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:30,561
We sang the revolution songs,
went to protests.

626
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,445
He didn't feel nostalgic,
neither for Mexico nor for his family,

627
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:42,489
which I found strange.

628
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:53,584
He made anyone who talked with him,
on the streets or the buses, his family.

629
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:57,504
"An unexpected call from Managua…"

630
00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:00,340
We organized a poetry marathon.

631
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:02,300
"Ernesto, Laureano is dead."

632
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:04,677
I think Samuel never read anything.

633
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:06,888
"…Jamaica, Havana, Managua…"

634
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:12,769
But he was way up the stairs,
listening, entranced.

635
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,063
Carried away.

636
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:18,775
"When I lost you, we both lost."

637
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:23,196
"I, because you were
what I loved the most…"

638
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,449
I'm absolutely sure

639
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:29,410
it was here
where he revealed himself as a poet.

640
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:32,706
Here, he discovered poetry,
Nicaraguan poetry,

641
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:34,708
and got captivated by it.

642
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:39,212
He was like a bird

643
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:42,758
who would fly from one branch to another.

644
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:49,973
Suddenly, one day, he said,

645
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:53,268
"I'm going to León to work."

646
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:57,105
But it turns out he didn't go to León
to work at the university.

647
00:39:57,189 --> 00:39:58,481
RESTRICTED AREA
KEEP OUT

648
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:04,905
Samuel went to join
the Sandinista Popular Militia…

649
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:07,950
to fight the enemy.

650
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:28,803
Then there was a shift
in Samuel's mindset,

651
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:32,099
in terms of his character.

652
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:42,734
He was part of the militia.
There, it's kill or be killed.

653
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:10,012
<i>You end up fighting yourself.</i>

654
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:13,557
I don't know…

655
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:19,980
I refuse to think or believe
Samuel is dead.

656
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:24,151
I think he could, he might…

657
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:28,572
He might be somewhere around the world.

658
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:43,503
<i>He was running out of testosterone.</i>

659
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:46,298
<i>He was running out of revolutions to join.</i>

660
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:10,155
I was shocked, it was a very thick book.

661
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:13,408
That's his whole published works,
three books.

662
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:15,202
Three books?

663
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:33,053
"I write with a Bic ball pen

664
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:38,684
that lets out a juicy ink
of Italian wine."

665
00:42:39,685 --> 00:42:41,895
"I am in room 94,

666
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:45,440
where I have fallen in so many times

667
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:49,069
with a sleepless drunkenness on my back."

668
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:56,493
"Do you know
this room is the second-to-last,

669
00:42:56,994 --> 00:43:02,499
but an esoteric calculation
made me think of the number 13,

670
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:07,171
a fortunate number
for a ridiculous epitaph?"

671
00:43:09,214 --> 00:43:11,716
"I pondered about suicide

672
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,430
by a struck with a tequila bottle
in the hands of the woman I love."

673
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,476
"Managua Hotel's bones slept,

674
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:24,980
put in a cast after the tremor,

675
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:28,525
waiting for its wreck at any corner."

676
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:38,327
"I am not that Chinese philosopher
who dreamt he was a butterfly."

677
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:42,247
"I am a self-banished poet…

678
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:52,633
who is fused in the memory
with a <i>ranchero</i> bacchanal."

679
00:43:55,177 --> 00:43:57,221
I'm really surprised by it…

680
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:02,267
because this is a poem…

681
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:07,105
with surrealist echoes.

682
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:11,860
And there is also delirium in it,

683
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:13,779
which is also surrealist.

684
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:19,660
Suicide…

685
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,292
This poem, <i>Managua</i>, baffles me.

686
00:44:28,669 --> 00:44:31,046
Why reminiscing about the Managua Hotel?

687
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:36,385
That's pure nostalgia.

688
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:43,183
Pure delirious nostalgia.

689
00:44:48,146 --> 00:44:51,608
I hope Samuel is alive.

690
00:44:59,074 --> 00:45:02,619
I ran into him once. I told him,
"What's up, Samuel? Let's have a coffee."

691
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:06,206
He answered, "No, I have money.
Let me buy you lunch."

692
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,666
"How did you get that money, Samuel?"

693
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:11,378
He said, "I have to tell you that story."
I said, "What?"

694
00:45:12,546 --> 00:45:14,965
And he said, "I was paid 5,000 pesos
to kill some bastard."

695
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:16,800
"How did you kill him?"

696
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:20,804
He replied, "I shot him twice in the head,
and then I ran away, just like that."

697
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:22,890
I said, "Wow, man."

698
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:30,188
<i>What did really happen?</i>

699
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:36,694
Well, they searched for him at mass graves
using his brother's DNA,

700
00:45:36,778 --> 00:45:41,241
but they didn't find him.

701
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:42,784
I mean, he's not dead.

702
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:47,914
<i>He might be in Hong Kong or in Shanghai.</i>

703
00:45:47,998 --> 00:45:50,375
<i>He's a man of adventure.</i>

704
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:51,918
<i>Where is he?</i>

705
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:55,130
<i>I don't think he's dead because…</i>

706
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:59,176
<i>What could have happened to him?</i>
<i>Maybe he's having an adventure.</i>

707
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:04,013
I think his life was an adventure.

708
00:46:04,097 --> 00:46:05,348
It could be a thriller too,

709
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:07,893
but I hope…

710
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:11,146
that it is a thriller
in which he's not the victim.

711
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:21,489
<i>There are many ways to be a poet.</i>

712
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:25,160
<i>And the history of poetry</i>
<i>has created its own myths.</i>

713
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:30,248
<i>A very established one</i>
<i>is the myth of the wandering poet</i>

714
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:33,960
<i>who's touched by grace,</i>
<i>and doesn't need to work</i>

715
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:40,342
<i>because he can find beauty in the world</i>
<i>without anyone's support.</i>

716
00:46:47,266 --> 00:46:50,351
"Martha Tamez, I think you understand

717
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:54,606
that poetry is an element
whose most intimate essence is freedom."

718
00:46:56,233 --> 00:47:01,780
They're looking for a person
named Samuel David Noyola García.

719
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:05,325
<i>Why should a poet clock in every day</i>
<i>and have a nine-to-five job?</i>

720
00:47:06,743 --> 00:47:10,413
He's used psychoactive drugs,
mainly alcohol.

721
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:11,831
Therefore, there's a possibility

722
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:16,879
that he ended up having a mental illness.
Maybe he was brought here.

723
00:47:22,467 --> 00:47:25,637
<i>When you've been in touch</i>
<i>with your sensitivity for so long,</i>

724
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:27,639
<i>when you've been alone</i>
<i>with your sensitivity</i>

725
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:29,974
<i>without following any external rule,</i>

726
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:32,603
<i>your own light can make you burst.</i>

727
00:47:44,907 --> 00:47:46,783
<i>"Poetry moves on its own."</i>

728
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:48,576
<i>"And poets do too."</i>

729
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:53,373
<i>"Their spontaneity is fed by the sap</i>
<i>of the Tree of Knowledge,</i>

730
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:55,667
<i>but also by the sap of the Tree of Life."</i>

731
00:47:57,628 --> 00:48:03,716
<i>"They don't look for anything specific,</i>
<i>and nobody feels sorry for them."</i>

732
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:09,765
<i>"I can tell you that everything I've done</i>
<i>I did it in search of my own self."</i>

733
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:18,356
<i>"Poetry is a secret illusion,</i>
<i>a song born at the center of everything,</i>

734
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,275
<i>not a product."</i>

735
00:48:21,652 --> 00:48:23,654
<i>"Your friend, Samuel Noyola."</i>

736
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:33,914
<i>And in one of those texts,</i>
<i>he referred to himself as Midday Cowboy,</i>

737
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:38,752
<i>in reference to a conversation he had had</i>
<i>with Mario Santiago Papasquiaro.</i>

738
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:42,630
Mario Santiago
was a good friend of Roberto Bolaño's.

739
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:43,590
WRITER AND FRIEND

740
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:46,176
He appeared in Bolaño's novel
<i>The Savage Detectives</i>

741
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,761
under the name Ulises Lima.

742
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:48,971
On a certain occasion,

743
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:52,850
Mario Santiago asked me to meet him
at the La Habana café.

744
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:57,520
Samuel Noyola came with me.

745
00:48:57,604 --> 00:48:59,147
"I'll introduce you to Mario."

746
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:01,275
He thought it was a great opportunity.

747
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:09,783
It was noon,
and Mario Santiago had this superstition

748
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:14,413
that it was bad luck
to start drinking before noon.

749
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,499
We met at twelve o'clock precisely,

750
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:19,501
so he ordered a beer.

751
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:25,256
And Samuel Noyola was dressed
in true North Mexican fashion,

752
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:30,386
with boots and a belt with a big buckle.

753
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:34,224
Mario Santiago was captivated

754
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:36,476
by this young poet with a cowboy look.

755
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:41,689
He remembered the movie <i>Midnight Cowboy</i>,

756
00:49:41,773 --> 00:49:44,526
and since the clock had just struck noon,

757
00:49:45,235 --> 00:49:50,157
he signed that copy,
"To Samuel Noyola, the Midday Cowboy."

758
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:11,177
It's hard to say why he kept
that nickname, Midday Cowboy,

759
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:12,137
but…

760
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:16,433
Also, Roberto Bolaño gave great prestige

761
00:50:16,517 --> 00:50:19,227
to the figure of the savage detective.

762
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:20,395
<i>THE SAVAGE DETECTIVES</i>

763
00:50:20,479 --> 00:50:22,730
To Roberto Bolaño, the savage detective

764
00:50:22,814 --> 00:50:26,067
is the most radical researcher of reality,

765
00:50:26,151 --> 00:50:32,782
the one who pursues
different areas of experience,

766
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:34,617
a researcher of life.

767
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:36,954
Therefore, that person is a poet.

768
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:04,439
One of the worst things that happened
to Samuel was being in jail.

769
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:09,194
INQUIRY AGAINST SAMUEL NOYOLA

770
00:51:09,278 --> 00:51:12,322
DETAINED UNDER CHARGES OF TRESPASSING

771
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:13,574
RELEASED ON PAROLE

772
00:51:21,665 --> 00:51:24,084
There was a robbery
at an office in La Condesa.

773
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:27,712
Some papers from that office
got scattered on the street.

774
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:33,426
Samuel gathered them, thinking of helping
those people get their papers back,

775
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:37,180
and maybe he also wanted
to get some kind of reward.

776
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:40,892
He was living off the kindness
of strangers.

777
00:51:40,976 --> 00:51:42,769
ENTRANCE CONTROL

778
00:51:42,853 --> 00:51:47,690
That got him arrested
as a suspected accomplice.

779
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:51,778
So, what happens to very sensitive people

780
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:54,697
when they end up in a place

781
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:59,577
where they can only survive
if they forget their human essence?

782
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:01,663
OBSERVATION AND CLASSIFICATION

783
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:18,930
Then came the process
which drove him into a marginal life.

784
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:22,767
He started to drink
the worst kind of booze.

785
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:26,647
The few times I saw him,
when he was already…

786
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:32,027
sleeping on the streets every day,

787
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:36,448
those meetings were very painful.

788
00:52:36,532 --> 00:52:38,992
I mean, he'd see me
and immediately start crying.

789
00:52:39,076 --> 00:52:43,956
He couldn't even have
a normal conversation with me.

790
00:53:07,563 --> 00:53:11,024
<i>I order you to appear…</i>

791
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:14,695
<i>before me.</i>

792
00:53:16,238 --> 00:53:18,907
Look, these rooms were built

793
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:21,952
to be pigsties. We raised pigs here.

794
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:28,500
<i>I've saved you from the justice</i>
<i>of the world of the living</i>

795
00:53:29,418 --> 00:53:31,920
<i>so you can remain at my service.</i>

796
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:35,840
When he arrived here, the bastard said,
"I've reached my lowest low."

797
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:36,800
POET AND DISCIPLE

798
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:54,818
Samuel and I put that cross there.

799
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:58,322
We chose it to protect this house.

800
00:53:59,072 --> 00:54:02,159
It's a crooked cross for crooks like us,
who are a bit…

801
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:04,995
damaged, right?

802
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:10,333
I curse you!

803
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:12,419
No, wait!

804
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:14,212
There's this movie…

805
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:19,008
That was one of my most fun moments
with that bastard Samuel Noyola.

806
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:21,929
The movie
was called <i>Dr. Satan Versus Black Magic</i>.

807
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:27,976
Samuel was the type of guy with whom
you could enjoy things like that.

808
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:31,980
We've obeyed your orders.

809
00:54:32,064 --> 00:54:34,483
Samuel and I were…

810
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:38,820
That damn movie was so crazy.

811
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:43,783
Since we had no work to do,

812
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:47,079
we had no money for booze,
and I like drinking too.

813
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,623
So, Samuel wasn't drinking.

814
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:53,585
Then, little by little, he regained…

815
00:54:54,795 --> 00:55:00,216
his sense of humor,
his serenity, his clarity.

816
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,177
He was really ingenious.

817
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:05,556
He was always writing poems.

818
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:17,234
Samuel would always leave
a trail of chaos in his wake.

819
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:21,697
When someone speaks ill of him,
I reply, "Okay, but he's my friend."

820
00:55:23,532 --> 00:55:27,202
He's my friend. I don't care much
about what people say about him.

821
00:55:27,286 --> 00:55:30,581
He saved my life.

822
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,001
Zombies.

823
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:36,420
Disgusting.

824
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:45,137
Being called Samuel Noyola's disciple
is a compliment to me.

825
00:55:45,804 --> 00:55:49,850
In his daily life, he wasn't going around
announcing himself as a poet.

826
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:54,104
Because something changes
when you say you're a poet.

827
00:55:55,063 --> 00:55:57,148
Something changes in people's minds.

828
00:55:57,232 --> 00:55:59,943
They start thinking
you're some sort of clown.

829
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:02,613
But he saved my life.

830
00:56:03,614 --> 00:56:05,532
Yeah, because he gave it meaning.

831
00:56:06,158 --> 00:56:07,284
He did that for me,

832
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:11,079
who, in every job I had,
found everything annoying.

833
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:12,622
Everything felt decrepit to me.

834
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:16,460
At a factory I worked when I was underage,

835
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:19,462
they asked me,
"Why are you reading those damn books?"

836
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:22,549
"You'll end up roaming the streets naked
if you keep reading so much."

837
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:24,009
They mocked me.

838
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:26,761
"What's that damn book you're reading?"

839
00:56:26,845 --> 00:56:29,556
"<i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i>?"
"What's that shit?"

840
00:56:30,557 --> 00:56:33,602
Yeah, they mock you
as if the book were offensive to them.

841
00:56:34,186 --> 00:56:35,061
They do.

842
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:39,066
If there's a city where being a poet
is worth it, that's Monterrey.

843
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:44,780
Why? Because of all the adversity
you see around you.

844
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:56,791
If you're a full-blooded northerner,
or if you know the city well,

845
00:56:56,875 --> 00:57:00,712
one of the things you miss the most
about living in downtown Monterrey

846
00:57:00,796 --> 00:57:03,382
is the atmosphere on Madero Avenue.

847
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:09,721
Madero Avenue was the quintessential place
to have a day out with your family

848
00:57:09,805 --> 00:57:12,599
before there were shopping malls.

849
00:57:14,142 --> 00:57:15,394
Hi, guys, how are you?

850
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:17,812
If you walk down Madero Avenue,

851
00:57:17,896 --> 00:57:20,482
you'll find one of the restaurants.

852
00:57:21,191 --> 00:57:22,109
The Al.

853
00:57:23,235 --> 00:57:25,195
"Al" is what remains.

854
00:57:27,531 --> 00:57:31,118
Its name is "Al" by chance,
it used to be called "Alaska."

855
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,371
Part of its sign fell off,
and that's what was left, "Al."

856
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:37,499
I'd like to point out something first.

857
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:39,250
I only met Samuel one night.

858
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:40,251
POET

859
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:44,506
And it wasn't a…
romance nor anything of the sort.

860
00:57:48,177 --> 00:57:51,597
The first time I went for a walk
with Samuel, we went down this street.

861
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:54,224
This is Madero Avenue.

862
00:57:54,308 --> 00:57:55,767
These facades,

863
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:00,564
everything covered with things
that no longer exist,

864
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:03,566
decayed shops.

865
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:04,526
Yeah.

866
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:08,780
Even if you tried to pretend it's not,
you won't be able to…

867
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:13,035
Monterrey is a decayed city.

868
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:16,246
It was in 2006.

869
00:58:16,914 --> 00:58:20,125
We were just kids.

870
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:23,002
We must have been 21 or 22 years old.

871
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:25,255
All the guys at that table
were smart-asses,

872
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:27,132
and from Mexico City, to top it off!

873
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:34,180
Samuel knew
the wonderful world of Mexico City,

874
00:58:34,264 --> 00:58:36,558
with its literary circles
and all that shit.

875
00:58:37,476 --> 00:58:40,103
We chatted a bit.
"Hi, where are you from?" "Monterrey."

876
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:42,773
"Oh, me too!" "What's your name?"
"Samuel Noyola."

877
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:48,236
I used to ask him about that one writer,
or that other poet, and such.

878
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,489
And he knew them all,
whether he liked them or not.

879
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:54,660
He'd speak fondly or ill
about any of them.

880
00:58:56,328 --> 00:59:00,540
He was a bit left out
at that table at the Covadonga bar.

881
00:59:00,624 --> 00:59:02,751
This photo was taken there.

882
00:59:03,585 --> 00:59:06,337
That was at the beginning of the night.

883
00:59:06,421 --> 00:59:07,631
Everyone was having their fun.

884
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:10,968
Maybe he didn't care
about how the rest was having fun.

885
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,512
But he wasn't like everybody else.

886
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:16,681
Another Saturday, another party.

887
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:19,142
Someone suggested
that we should go have more beer.

888
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:20,977
Another guy said, "Take Samuel with you."

889
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:25,065
Gaby said, "Wait, I'll go to the toilet,"
and gave them a pink bag.

890
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:29,819
Samuel took it and joked,
"So you're using me as a coat rack?"

891
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:31,780
And he hanged the bag around his neck.

892
00:59:31,864 --> 00:59:34,867
I thought it was really funny,
and then I took that photo.

893
00:59:44,459 --> 00:59:45,878
That's strange…

894
00:59:46,712 --> 00:59:48,881
How come there are no more pictures of him
after this one?

895
00:59:49,548 --> 00:59:51,133
This is from 2006.

896
00:59:53,051 --> 00:59:55,470
We were very drunk already,
it was morning,

897
00:59:55,554 --> 00:59:57,180
so we went to the Internacional bar.

898
00:59:57,264 --> 01:00:01,601
Those poor bastards
were cleaning the place already.

899
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:05,147
But since they didn't kick us out,
we had some beers…

900
01:00:07,149 --> 01:00:09,109
And I have never seen him again since.

901
01:00:09,193 --> 01:00:12,737
What's up, bro? Is there any chance
I can get a beer around here?

902
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:14,906
We went to get some beers,

903
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:17,826
and Samuel pulled out a wad of bills.

904
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,161
He said, "No, this one's on me."

905
01:00:20,495 --> 01:00:23,665
At 6:00 or 7:00 a.m.,
dawn was almost breaking,

906
01:00:23,749 --> 01:00:26,126
and someone yelled, "My purse!"

907
01:00:27,753 --> 01:00:30,296
"I lost my rent money!"

908
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,466
And I thought, "Shut up."

909
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,220
So I told him, "You know what?"

910
01:00:37,554 --> 01:00:39,848
"There's no future for you here anymore."

911
01:00:40,516 --> 01:00:42,267
"Leave town and don't come back,

912
01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:45,979
find something somewhere else

913
01:00:46,813 --> 01:00:48,815
because you've burned
all your bridges here."

914
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:50,650
He had misbehaved too much here,

915
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:53,445
too many people had complained about him.

916
01:00:53,529 --> 01:00:56,197
When you realize that you can't get by
in a city anymore,

917
01:00:56,281 --> 01:00:58,408
you'll have better chances elsewhere.

918
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:01,245
I think that guy ran out of chances here.

919
01:01:03,872 --> 01:01:05,832
We had one or two more beers,

920
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:08,293
and I haven't seen him again ever since.

921
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:12,381
That was all of Samuel Noyola in my life,
I never saw him again.

922
01:01:13,674 --> 01:01:16,301
His disappearance
had also to do with a context…

923
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:21,056
of literary contempt.

924
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,308
It wasn't about the drugs.

925
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:27,937
Samuel wasn't the only one who did drugs.

926
01:01:28,021 --> 01:01:29,481
There was also a segregation.

927
01:01:30,816 --> 01:01:33,694
Ranks were defined…

928
01:01:34,945 --> 01:01:37,155
and well, he was left out.

929
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:51,878
I've known this street
for more than 15 years.

930
01:01:51,962 --> 01:01:53,463
I used to sell chewing gum here.

931
01:01:55,966 --> 01:01:57,634
Come, let's get a room.

932
01:02:00,762 --> 01:02:01,846
Come.

933
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,140
If Madero Avenue could talk,

934
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:05,767
well, Monterrey would explode.

935
01:02:08,187 --> 01:02:09,479
Ask me anything, darling.

936
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:11,982
What do you like to do most here?

937
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:15,026
I only know how to prostitute myself…

938
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:15,985
SEX WORKER

939
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:18,780
…get people to like me, and satisfy them.

940
01:02:18,864 --> 01:02:20,824
See them leave happy.

941
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:24,912
They find here on Madero
what they can't get at home.

942
01:02:26,246 --> 01:02:27,956
That's it. Anything else?

943
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,084
This guy I told you about…

944
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:34,004
He's been missing for eight years.

945
01:02:34,922 --> 01:02:37,299
We don't know where he is.
We're looking for him.

946
01:02:39,259 --> 01:02:42,095
You're looking for him,
but you don't know if he's dead or alive.

947
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:46,349
My family didn't know anything about me
for more than ten years.

948
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:47,518
They thought…

949
01:02:48,477 --> 01:02:49,686
I was dead.

950
01:02:50,646 --> 01:02:55,525
If he doesn't come back or doesn't want
to be found, he must have his reasons.

951
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:56,735
In my case,

952
01:02:57,361 --> 01:02:59,071
the streets treated me better
than my family.

953
01:03:01,365 --> 01:03:02,950
It is like my family, in fact.

954
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:06,870
Anything else? Sorry.

955
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:14,836
This poet, Noyola,
made the streets his home.

956
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,090
He also felt pain and suffered
because he had been abandoned.

957
01:03:21,051 --> 01:03:25,180
All sorts of different worlds collide
on the streets.

958
01:03:32,855 --> 01:03:36,149
I'll give you one of his books,
I think you might--

959
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:37,234
I can't read.

960
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:03,719
I AM NOT AFRAID OF THE DOGS
THAT GREET ME AT THE BACK OF NIGHT

961
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:07,681
LIKE CHILDREN HUNGRY FOR THE MOON

962
01:04:12,895 --> 01:04:18,108
BECAUSE MY DAYS HAVE RISEN
AGAINST A CITY BEJEWELED WITH BEGGARS

963
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,624
WHERE CERTAIN NUDES MADE OF CANTERA STONE

964
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:37,669
REVOLT WITH THEIR VIRTUE
OF THIGHS AND BREASTS

965
01:04:37,753 --> 01:04:41,131
AT THE CENTER OF THE PUBLIC SQUARE

966
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:52,809
BUT WITH THE GRIMACE
OF AN ASTONISHED MEDUSA,

967
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:55,687
ALREADY TURNED TO STONE
BY THE GLEAM IN THE MIRROR

968
01:04:55,771 --> 01:05:00,567
AND LULLED BY TERROR, AS TRANSPARENT
AS THE CITIZENS' BREATH

969
01:05:10,744 --> 01:05:14,038
WHEN A SPIRIT DRINK RUNS
AND SPLITS THE BLOOD

970
01:05:14,122 --> 01:05:16,625
OF OTHER NYMPHS WITH DUSKED WAISTS

971
01:05:22,923 --> 01:05:26,384
THERE WHERE THE HORIZON STARTS TO OPEN UP

972
01:05:26,468 --> 01:05:30,597
A GHOST TRAIN WHISTLES,
ITS WHEELS SPARKING

973
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:34,810
AS IF SETTING A TIME OF PROFANE CATHEDRALS
ON FIRE

974
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:40,440
I AM NOT AFRAID OF THE DOGS
THAT GREET ME AT THE BACK OF NIGHT

975
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:05,841
SAMUEL NOYOLA, THE WANDERING POET, IS DEAD

976
01:06:06,842 --> 01:06:08,719
I can read you the article if you want.

977
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,054
"Mexico City."

978
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,558
"Samuel Noyola, the quintessential
unrepentant Mexican poet,

979
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:17,727
someone who's brilliant every time
he has a pen in hand,

980
01:06:17,811 --> 01:06:19,438
and a confessed mythomaniac."

981
01:06:19,938 --> 01:06:23,525
"Whenever he has nothing to write about,
it's because he's outgrown reality

982
01:06:23,609 --> 01:06:26,027
and feels the need to embellish it."

983
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:27,571
We will certainly miss

984
01:06:28,155 --> 01:06:32,659
the courage and clarity of his thinking,

985
01:06:33,493 --> 01:06:35,621
his wide knowledge,

986
01:06:36,455 --> 01:06:37,414
and the strength

987
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:40,208
and beauty of his verses.

988
01:06:40,292 --> 01:06:42,001
"That year, Octavio Paz died."

989
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:43,086
"He was his patron."

990
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:47,590
"He considered Samuel
the most inspired poet of his generation."

991
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:49,551
"That was a terrible blow to Samuel,

992
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:52,513
who turned his gaze
to pain and alcoholic delirium."

993
01:06:53,263 --> 01:06:55,432
The <i>Unomásuno</i> magazine editors

994
01:06:55,516 --> 01:06:57,225
meant to write an article about Samuel,

995
01:06:57,309 --> 01:06:59,770
wondering if he was missing or dead.

996
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:04,899
But they forgot
to add question or quotation marks.

997
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:08,111
What the article intended to talk about

998
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:10,531
was Samuel's death as a writer.

999
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:13,200
He lived in a Volkswagen Caribe.

1000
01:07:14,076 --> 01:07:17,495
Samuel doesn't like to be defined
as a "cursed poet."

1001
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:21,332
In fact,
he considers himself a blessed poet.

1002
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:25,420
"I'm blessed because I keep walking,
because I'm breathing."

1003
01:07:25,504 --> 01:07:29,466
"Even if I don't have money
to take the subway, I can still walk."

1004
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:32,969
"I find walking alone exhilarating,
it's my therapy."

1005
01:07:33,053 --> 01:07:36,181
"And let me tell you
why loneliness is not a maze."

1006
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:40,435
"Even if I stumble because I'm drunk,
I'd rather go alone."

1007
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:42,937
"If I fall down, I fall down on my own."

1008
01:07:43,021 --> 01:07:46,024
"I've learned to walk in the darkness."

1009
01:07:46,108 --> 01:07:49,403
"I just get blinded by a flash for a while
from time to time."

1010
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:54,199
The interviewer asked him, "Does living
on the streets help you as a poet?"

1011
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:58,828
"Now my muse is reality itself,
but I've been left alone."

1012
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:01,080
"My life is quite strange."

1013
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:04,751
"I wonder if I'm a Martian,
a Catholic Martian."

1014
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:12,884
To some, in Samuel Noyola's story,

1015
01:08:12,968 --> 01:08:15,095
the facts got mixed with the ink,

1016
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:18,348
and we can't know what is a fact
and what is ink anymore.

1017
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:22,352
Whoever looks for him

1018
01:08:22,436 --> 01:08:26,147
only has to follow
the trail of piled-up wine boxes

1019
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:29,526
through his favorite places
in the Narvarte neighborhood.

1020
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:30,819
NARVARTE ORIENTE NEIGHBORHOOD

1021
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:32,737
You might find him there.

1022
01:08:32,821 --> 01:08:33,905
BENITO JUÁREZ BOROUGH

1023
01:08:33,989 --> 01:08:39,494
THE SALSA PALACE

1024
01:08:42,164 --> 01:08:45,209
Shall we go to Samuel Noyola's bedroom
at the La Maraka ballroom?

1025
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:51,215
Samuel used to sleep here.

1026
01:08:52,007 --> 01:08:53,425
We'd knock on his door.

1027
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:57,095
He'd tell us to knock on these tubes
so he could come,

1028
01:08:58,055 --> 01:09:00,432
open the chain for us
and let us enter his bedroom.

1029
01:09:01,725 --> 01:09:04,978
We couldn't go back there
in order not to get his blankets dirty.

1030
01:09:06,688 --> 01:09:10,859
I admired his poetry,
I had read <i>Tequila con calavera</i>.

1031
01:09:10,943 --> 01:09:12,152
SCULPTOR AND PROTECTOR

1032
01:09:12,236 --> 01:09:13,237
And…

1033
01:09:15,322 --> 01:09:18,283
I knew I was in front of an artist,
a poet.

1034
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:21,035
I immediately brought him in

1035
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:24,122
from his bedroom at La Maraka

1036
01:09:24,873 --> 01:09:26,333
to this place where we are now.

1037
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,796
Samuel has left some hints behind.
The mattress he slept on,

1038
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:35,842
that blue blanket,
the first one I gave him to sleep with.

1039
01:09:35,926 --> 01:09:38,261
I asked him why he drank so much.

1040
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:40,264
He answered

1041
01:09:41,181 --> 01:09:43,851
that he was depressed
because Octavio Paz had died.

1042
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:48,272
Samuel felt alone,

1043
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:53,360
but here, in his loneliness,
he found some happiness.

1044
01:09:56,029 --> 01:09:58,281
He'd go out at dawn for booze,

1045
01:09:58,365 --> 01:10:02,494
and we could hear he was outside
because he recited poetry out loud,

1046
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:08,083
so the neighbors knew that Samuel
was the entertainer of that night.

1047
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:09,877
Here, in front of the house.

1048
01:10:11,003 --> 01:10:13,088
Samuel made us sit here on the sidewalk,

1049
01:10:13,172 --> 01:10:14,464
side by side,

1050
01:10:15,299 --> 01:10:17,926
and then said,

1051
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:21,888
"Now I want a beer
if you want me to start the sonnet."

1052
01:10:21,972 --> 01:10:24,265
Sometimes, at one of the stores,

1053
01:10:24,349 --> 01:10:29,145
he exchanged some poems for beer.

1054
01:10:29,229 --> 01:10:32,357
I had a shop here. You can imagine, he was
my customer, but he didn't pay a thing.

1055
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:37,237
Every day, we'd give him sodas or beer.

1056
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:40,657
He's Luis.

1057
01:10:41,617 --> 01:10:42,993
He also knew Samuel.

1058
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:46,287
We, his friends from the streets,

1059
01:10:46,371 --> 01:10:48,915
encouraged him to keep writing.

1060
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:52,002
What do I remember about him?
Well, that he used to read for us.

1061
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:53,878
He taught us that.

1062
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:57,215
He wrote poems for the guys, so they
could give them to their girlfriends.

1063
01:10:57,299 --> 01:11:00,260
May we read one of the last known texts
by Samuel?

1064
01:11:00,344 --> 01:11:03,596
-Sure.
-He even talks about the Noyolotzin in it.

1065
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,848
"Octavio and the Suburban."

1066
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:06,182
"Noyolotzin Hotel."

1067
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:07,142
WRITER AND EDITOR

1068
01:11:07,226 --> 01:11:09,519
I was the editor
of the online version of <i>Letras Libres</i>.

1069
01:11:09,603 --> 01:11:11,730
Samuel started to offer me some texts.

1070
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:15,942
"At some time,
in the winter of my thirties,

1071
01:11:16,026 --> 01:11:18,319
I lived in a blue Suburban SUV
from the '80s."

1072
01:11:18,403 --> 01:11:22,032
That SUV where Noyola used to sleep
was parked here for eight years.

1073
01:11:23,575 --> 01:11:24,951
He lived there for six years.

1074
01:11:25,035 --> 01:11:28,163
He told me he had lived in an SUV
for a long time,

1075
01:11:28,247 --> 01:11:29,331
that it used to be his home.

1076
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:34,085
Yeah, this car was his hotel too.

1077
01:11:34,169 --> 01:11:36,839
-Did he fit in there?
-Sure! Yeah…

1078
01:11:38,465 --> 01:11:40,508
Yeah, he was quite tall.

1079
01:11:40,592 --> 01:11:43,595
But he'd arrange the seats
and get in there.

1080
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:49,226
My daughter used to sit with him
on the sidewalk to talk.

1081
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:54,022
He told her, "Let me help you write,"
but she said, "No."

1082
01:11:54,106 --> 01:11:55,023
TACO VENDOR AND FRIEND

1083
01:11:55,107 --> 01:11:57,401
She took the pen from him
and said, "You can't write."

1084
01:11:59,152 --> 01:12:01,613
This is my good friend Samuel's book.

1085
01:12:02,531 --> 01:12:05,909
He signed it, "To my dear Héctor Verón,

1086
01:12:05,993 --> 01:12:08,536
Ivonne," that's my wife,
"and Monse," that's my daughter.

1087
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:12,290
"Narvarte, 18th February, 2005."

1088
01:12:12,374 --> 01:12:15,252
That was shortly after they organized his…

1089
01:12:16,295 --> 01:12:17,962
his book presentation.

1090
01:12:18,046 --> 01:12:19,923
One day, when Samuel was living in my SUV,

1091
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:22,258
a guy from the Fine Arts Institute
came to see him.

1092
01:12:22,342 --> 01:12:24,677
He came to bring him a letter

1093
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:28,139
because they were organizing a ceremony
in tribute to Samuel Noyola.

1094
01:12:28,223 --> 01:12:29,808
You'll see me in the movies.

1095
01:12:31,602 --> 01:12:36,064
On the day of the event, we took out
a hose so he could take a shower.

1096
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:38,483
A neighbor gave him a pretty shirt.

1097
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:43,071
Another one gave him neat trousers
so he could be well dressed.

1098
01:12:46,241 --> 01:12:50,203
My wife and I
had the pleasure to befriend him.

1099
01:12:50,287 --> 01:12:51,162
Mr. Fernando.

1100
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:53,414
-Good afternoon, Paco, how are you?
-Fine.

1101
01:12:53,498 --> 01:12:57,669
We were invited to his book presentation.

1102
01:12:57,753 --> 01:12:59,505
That's why we had this signed copy,

1103
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:01,965
with a little drawing of his face

1104
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:03,508
he did himself.

1105
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:08,013
Despite living on the streets,

1106
01:13:08,722 --> 01:13:11,558
he was very well educated and well read.

1107
01:13:11,642 --> 01:13:15,103
We had a lot of trust in him,
so we went to see him, and it was true.

1108
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:19,399
We the neighbors were very proud
to have such an artist in our alley.

1109
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:26,573
Here Samuel used to guard parked cars.

1110
01:13:27,741 --> 01:13:29,826
"Before leaving my new job,

1111
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:33,079
I thought of marking the spots
at the nonexistent parking lot."

1112
01:13:33,163 --> 01:13:34,581
So he painted these lines?

1113
01:13:34,665 --> 01:13:35,957
-Yes.
-Did he paint them himself?

1114
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:39,961
He came up with the idea
of painting the lines.

1115
01:13:40,045 --> 01:13:43,798
"I started walking around La Maraka

1116
01:13:43,882 --> 01:13:46,510
after sitting in the cold
and seeing that incredible party

1117
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:48,136
with my deep eyes."

1118
01:13:49,221 --> 01:13:51,515
We're looking for a missing poet

1119
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:53,266
who used to work around here.

1120
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:56,144
"Manager Alejandro, in his freaky suit,
offered me a job."

1121
01:13:57,187 --> 01:14:00,607
Well, offering him a job? Not really.

1122
01:14:01,692 --> 01:14:03,943
But he was around here for a long time.

1123
01:14:04,027 --> 01:14:08,656
In these texts, there was a point
when he made a sort of confession.

1124
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:12,035
He told how he was offered
a job as a car guard,

1125
01:14:13,036 --> 01:14:18,249
which was quite… limited
in terms of money.

1126
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:20,586
But he wrote, "I did not care
because it was something real."

1127
01:14:21,753 --> 01:14:23,755
And he wrote "real" in capital letters,

1128
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:26,633
as if he were trying to emphasize,
as much as he could,

1129
01:14:26,717 --> 01:14:29,761
the difference, let's say,
between being and nothingness,

1130
01:14:30,512 --> 01:14:34,600
and the dividing line between them
was working as a car guard.

1131
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:44,526
"I remembered my tour around Mexico City."

1132
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:47,070
"Coming back to the same place was magic."

1133
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:49,489
"Working as a car guard
at a parking lot for artists

1134
01:14:49,573 --> 01:14:51,533
was something really sincere."

1135
01:14:52,242 --> 01:14:55,370
"At least, while living in hell,
it was something real."

1136
01:15:23,815 --> 01:15:27,986
Poetry is about dying or disappearing.

1137
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:35,661
There cannot be a great poet

1138
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:39,456
without a great work,

1139
01:15:40,082 --> 01:15:42,709
but there cannot be a great poet either

1140
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:45,629
without a myth that sustains them.

1141
01:15:47,548 --> 01:15:50,175
In 1996, a book was published

1142
01:15:50,259 --> 01:15:52,594
which included a conversation I had
with Samuel Noyola.

1143
01:15:52,678 --> 01:15:56,473
In it, I asked him
about his life and his work.

1144
01:15:56,557 --> 01:15:57,474
WRITER AND FRIEND

1145
01:15:57,558 --> 01:16:02,479
I'll read you
the part where he answered that.

1146
01:16:02,563 --> 01:16:05,857
"Since I came back from Nicaragua,
I've lived in shamelessness,

1147
01:16:05,941 --> 01:16:08,277
without having any shame."

1148
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:13,615
"I think this has happened
because I have no other option."

1149
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:18,453
He was at war with himself

1150
01:16:19,371 --> 01:16:20,831
and could not get away from it.

1151
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:23,750
"Monterrey is an industrial city,

1152
01:16:23,834 --> 01:16:26,878
and, even if people deny it,
it's a Protestant city as well."

1153
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:28,797
"There's no choice."

1154
01:16:28,881 --> 01:16:31,675
"The only thing they teach you
is how to work,

1155
01:16:32,176 --> 01:16:38,807
but to work for the five or four families
that have plundered this city."

1156
01:16:42,227 --> 01:16:43,729
Isn't that the man from the gas station?

1157
01:16:44,313 --> 01:16:45,563
-Which one?
-The blond one.

1158
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:47,399
TRUCKS ENTERING AND EXITING

1159
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:55,908
He entered a bar, saw me…

1160
01:16:56,867 --> 01:16:58,160
Bring me a beer.

1161
01:17:00,495 --> 01:17:01,580
…and then said,

1162
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:04,458
"You're an idiot, man."

1163
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:09,212
"I'm not interested
in putting on a flower-patterned tie

1164
01:17:09,296 --> 01:17:11,714
to feel like a salaried yuppie

1165
01:17:11,798 --> 01:17:14,927
who is, in fact,
just a slave with dandy aspirations."

1166
01:17:15,802 --> 01:17:17,512
"But, Samuel, what is this all about?"

1167
01:17:17,596 --> 01:17:21,892
"Man, I already told you," he said.
"If you want, we can take this outside."

1168
01:17:24,311 --> 01:17:27,314
I think he couldn't find his place,

1169
01:17:28,232 --> 01:17:33,362
which, in my opinion,
is a sign of sensitivity too, right?

1170
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:39,993
"Poets have no place
in contemporary society."

1171
01:17:40,661 --> 01:17:45,373
"They either are born rich
or work for the cultural bureaucracy."

1172
01:17:45,457 --> 01:17:50,378
"Then, they either kill themselves
or become idiots."

1173
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:52,756
"I'd rather rely on women for money

1174
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,717
than living under the protection
of a state

1175
01:17:55,801 --> 01:17:58,303
that's more shameless than me,

1176
01:17:58,387 --> 01:18:03,600
or of the most miserable rich people
on the planet."

1177
01:18:06,979 --> 01:18:09,481
Have you seen the man who is usually
at the gas station?

1178
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:11,859
There he comes, look.

1179
01:18:12,442 --> 01:18:14,652
Samuel arrived. He looked magnificent.

1180
01:18:14,736 --> 01:18:15,862
WRITER AND FRIEND

1181
01:18:15,946 --> 01:18:17,281
That was the first time I saw him.

1182
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:19,575
I had a plush jacket on.

1183
01:18:20,576 --> 01:18:21,952
A pink plush jacket.

1184
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:25,622
It had a bar code adhered to it.

1185
01:18:26,957 --> 01:18:30,919
He told me, "Guillermo, how are you?"
and opened up his arms to me.

1186
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:34,047
I'm sincere, I don't pretend to be nice.

1187
01:18:35,215 --> 01:18:36,758
So I told him, "Who are you?"

1188
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:39,636
-Let's see…
-And he got really mad.

1189
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:42,388
-Hello.
-Good afternoon.

1190
01:18:42,472 --> 01:18:45,058
"I'm Samuel Noyola." "Oh, the poet!"

1191
01:18:45,893 --> 01:18:48,061
"Pleased to meet you."
But he was mad already.

1192
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:50,355
What will you ask him?

1193
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,403
He grabbed the bar code

1194
01:18:56,945 --> 01:18:58,197
and stuck it on my forehead.

1195
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:04,536
I had two reactions. On the one hand,
I wanted to punch him in the face.

1196
01:19:05,412 --> 01:19:07,206
On the other hand, it made me laugh a lot.

1197
01:19:07,873 --> 01:19:14,838
It was such a sarcastic gesture,
to stick the bar code on me,

1198
01:19:14,922 --> 01:19:18,133
as if he were telling me,
"You're a product of marketing."

1199
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:19,968
Are you Mr. Samuel?

1200
01:19:20,052 --> 01:19:22,304
We're looking
for a man named Samuel Noyola.

1201
01:19:24,264 --> 01:19:25,474
Mr. Samuel Noyola.

1202
01:19:27,768 --> 01:19:28,768
Yeah?

1203
01:19:28,852 --> 01:19:31,897
And he threatened
to punch Carlos Martínez Rentería.

1204
01:19:33,774 --> 01:19:35,984
I'm the opposite of a bouncer.

1205
01:19:36,068 --> 01:19:36,943
JOURNALIST AND ENEMY

1206
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:39,904
They bounce drunks out, I bounce them in.

1207
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:41,906
We made an issue of <i>Generación</i> magazine.

1208
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:46,161
Samuel told me,
"Let me help you with the sales."

1209
01:19:49,081 --> 01:19:52,709
He sold about 80 copies.

1210
01:19:53,252 --> 01:19:56,088
Rentería told him,
"Okay, let's talk about numbers."

1211
01:19:57,089 --> 01:20:00,217
But he replied, "No, I'm leaving."

1212
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:03,887
"Look, here are the numbers."

1213
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:08,183
He gave him the magazines back
and ran away with the money.

1214
01:20:08,267 --> 01:20:10,310
He ran away and I said, "No way."

1215
01:20:10,394 --> 01:20:12,437
I mean, I thought he was kidding, man.

1216
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:14,898
So I went after him, but when I got out,

1217
01:20:14,982 --> 01:20:16,525
he was already at the corner.

1218
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,194
What the fuck?

1219
01:20:19,278 --> 01:20:22,614
I thought it was
some extraordinary accounting work, right?

1220
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:29,663
Noyola manages to balance

1221
01:20:30,247 --> 01:20:34,209
the worst and the best of a drunkard.

1222
01:20:34,293 --> 01:20:38,297
The worst,
because he does all kinds of shit.

1223
01:20:39,173 --> 01:20:41,591
He can be violent, rude,

1224
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:44,761
thieving, disgusting.

1225
01:20:44,845 --> 01:20:46,137
What's your name?

1226
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:49,141
That's the camera I stole
at Stanford University.

1227
01:20:50,017 --> 01:20:52,269
When they were announcing
that damn war, do you remember?

1228
01:20:53,437 --> 01:20:56,272
And he can also be subtle, intelligent,

1229
01:20:56,356 --> 01:20:59,818
lucid, loving, and brotherly.

1230
01:21:01,153 --> 01:21:02,946
The person we're looking for is a poet.

1231
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:04,031
That man from yesterday?

1232
01:21:04,948 --> 01:21:07,576
-No, he--
-You are a poet, man.

1233
01:21:09,161 --> 01:21:10,370
But a poet of the Holy Death.

1234
01:21:12,331 --> 01:21:13,790
This is the voice he heard.

1235
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:15,626
He's leaving now.

1236
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:19,838
He lost his homeland, his family,
everything.

1237
01:21:31,225 --> 01:21:32,893
I've been thinking a lot about Samuel.

1238
01:21:36,647 --> 01:21:38,232
I've been thinking about…

1239
01:21:39,733 --> 01:21:40,984
what might have become of him.

1240
01:21:42,444 --> 01:21:44,780
I know you've looked for him everywhere.
I did too.

1241
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:59,961
You know, a friend of mine told me
that the last time she saw him,

1242
01:22:00,045 --> 01:22:02,756
he was in La Condesa, sitting,

1243
01:22:03,298 --> 01:22:05,050
waiting for a bookstore to open.

1244
01:22:06,593 --> 01:22:09,555
She saw a sort of dark energy in him.

1245
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:12,390
I asked her,
"Why do you say it was dark?",

1246
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:17,145
and she replied, "He seemed ill,
like someone who is about to die."

1247
01:22:19,523 --> 01:22:22,192
I saw him more and more sporadically…

1248
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:25,320
and he was almost always injured.

1249
01:22:26,238 --> 01:22:28,114
It showed he had been beaten.

1250
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:31,743
TRUTH IS NOT ASHAMED OF ANYTHING
BUT OF BEING HIDDEN

1251
01:22:31,827 --> 01:22:35,914
Many of us protected him, fed him,

1252
01:22:36,582 --> 01:22:39,292
paid for his beer,

1253
01:22:39,376 --> 01:22:43,172
and he, in retribution,
defied us to fight.

1254
01:22:43,797 --> 01:22:46,633
He thanked you by spitting in your face.

1255
01:22:51,555 --> 01:22:55,141
That resentment he created towards him

1256
01:22:55,225 --> 01:22:57,644
caused that people
started making up stories about him,

1257
01:22:57,728 --> 01:22:59,938
that he stole a TV,

1258
01:23:00,022 --> 01:23:05,360
that he drank everything
in Sonya Garza Rapport's drink fridge,

1259
01:23:05,444 --> 01:23:09,405
that he made collect calls from the USA…

1260
01:23:09,489 --> 01:23:13,118
People made up stories
to make him look bad

1261
01:23:13,202 --> 01:23:17,789
because they resented him a lot.

1262
01:23:17,873 --> 01:23:23,128
And he seemed to enjoy their hatred.

1263
01:23:29,676 --> 01:23:31,553
I think, in the end,
he had no money even for food.

1264
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:34,932
So, I…

1265
01:23:37,267 --> 01:23:41,104
think… well, I sometimes think
that Samuel is no longer with us.

1266
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:48,362
He's not here in Nicaragua.
Least of all now.

1267
01:23:50,155 --> 01:23:51,573
I have a theory…

1268
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:55,452
I've been working around it.

1269
01:23:55,536 --> 01:23:57,788
Samuel wasn't a poet here.

1270
01:23:59,331 --> 01:24:00,791
He became a poet here.

1271
01:24:02,084 --> 01:24:04,169
But then he fell into the hands…

1272
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:06,505
of Octavio Paz.

1273
01:24:15,556 --> 01:24:16,598
I wish him the best.

1274
01:24:17,975 --> 01:24:22,229
I wish him what we'd call a normal life.

1275
01:24:23,438 --> 01:24:26,650
But I also have
to come to terms with the possibility

1276
01:24:27,276 --> 01:24:29,862
that something might have happened
to him and nobody knows about it.

1277
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:39,037
We looked for him at community kitchens
and under the bridges,

1278
01:24:39,121 --> 01:24:41,206
we walked around Barrio Antiguo.

1279
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:43,333
He wasn't at prisons or jails either.

1280
01:24:43,417 --> 01:24:46,669
Up to now,
he hasn't been in prison for any crime.

1281
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:47,921
They know nothing about him.

1282
01:24:48,005 --> 01:24:50,007
If he were in jail,
we'd have found him already.

1283
01:24:55,304 --> 01:24:56,847
So far, we haven't had any news.

1284
01:24:59,308 --> 01:25:02,435
I AM NOT AFRAID OF THE DOGS
THAT GREET ME AT THE BACK OF NIGHT

1285
01:25:02,519 --> 01:25:06,856
We've made searches
in every database the state has available,

1286
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:09,567
that of the Ministry of Public Security,

1287
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:11,111
that of the Forensic Medicine Service,

1288
01:25:11,195 --> 01:25:14,197
and we've taken into account
the evidence we have already,

1289
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:16,783
like the DNA results.

1290
01:25:16,867 --> 01:25:23,414
Up to now, regarding the tests
made on unidentified corpses,

1291
01:25:23,498 --> 01:25:27,085
so far, we've had no match yet.

1292
01:25:29,463 --> 01:25:30,964
Killing Samuel…

1293
01:25:32,257 --> 01:25:34,551
I think it'd have been too easy.

1294
01:25:34,635 --> 01:25:36,053
He gave you motives, you know?

1295
01:25:37,095 --> 01:25:39,806
Imagine he went to Chilpancingo,

1296
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:42,768
entered a bar
and got into a fight with six guys.

1297
01:25:44,978 --> 01:25:47,814
They made him disappear,
as simple as that, right?

1298
01:25:50,192 --> 01:25:52,945
I think he was murdered

1299
01:25:53,904 --> 01:25:55,489
and his body was dumped somewhere,

1300
01:25:56,323 --> 01:25:58,408
in one of the many mass graves

1301
01:25:58,492 --> 01:26:01,787
that our governments
considered necessary to foster.

1302
01:26:13,298 --> 01:26:14,174
Where is he?

1303
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:19,012
I don't know why,
but I suspect that, in every action,

1304
01:26:19,096 --> 01:26:21,265
Samuel is always trying to be memorable.

1305
01:26:22,015 --> 01:26:26,478
And he achieves it, in his own way.
I don't know if he does it consciously.

1306
01:26:27,479 --> 01:26:30,398
But he'll surely do something
that nobody will forget.

1307
01:26:30,482 --> 01:26:32,859
I really think that,
if I haven't heard of him in years,

1308
01:26:32,943 --> 01:26:34,820
the guy is no longer alive.

1309
01:26:35,779 --> 01:26:38,031
Yeah. Do you think he is?

1310
01:26:50,878 --> 01:26:53,130
Shuffle the deck, please.

1311
01:26:54,089 --> 01:26:54,965
Seven times.

1312
01:26:56,258 --> 01:26:59,135
I want you to think
about the person you're asking about…

1313
01:26:59,219 --> 01:27:00,220
FORTUNE TELLER

1314
01:27:00,304 --> 01:27:02,680
…so you can give out
the vibration of that person.

1315
01:27:02,764 --> 01:27:04,725
Cut the deck in three, please.

1316
01:27:07,477 --> 01:27:10,355
Of course, free spirits

1317
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:13,567
are so detrimental
for a society like ours,

1318
01:27:14,109 --> 01:27:16,320
anti-philosophical, moronic,

1319
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:20,199
coward, forgetful…

1320
01:27:20,824 --> 01:27:24,494
For such a society, a man like that
must have been troublesome.

1321
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:29,666
It was easy to scare him.

1322
01:27:32,085 --> 01:27:33,837
Deep down, he was a scaredy-cat.

1323
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:37,508
Because he was alone.

1324
01:27:38,884 --> 01:27:40,302
He was very aggressive,

1325
01:27:41,178 --> 01:27:45,682
like those dogs that have been beaten
or raped by other dogs,

1326
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:48,768
that you look them in the eye and say,

1327
01:27:48,852 --> 01:27:51,563
"Poor dog, they've fucked with him a lot."

1328
01:27:52,231 --> 01:27:55,567
Put your hand on top of those three cards.

1329
01:27:56,693 --> 01:27:58,362
Say, "For him…"

1330
01:27:59,363 --> 01:28:01,781
-"For him…"
-"…for what we want to know…"

1331
01:28:01,865 --> 01:28:04,159
-"…for what we want to know…"
-"…and we want to know…"

1332
01:28:04,243 --> 01:28:05,452
"…and we want to know…"

1333
01:28:05,536 --> 01:28:08,037
-"…if this person…"
-"…if this person…"

1334
01:28:08,121 --> 01:28:10,374
-"…is dead…"
-"…is dead…"

1335
01:28:12,084 --> 01:28:15,003
-"…or where he is."
-"…or where he is."

1336
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:44,908
Samuel and I were obsessed

1337
01:28:45,742 --> 01:28:52,040
with the idea that, as you grow old,
people start taking things from you.

1338
01:28:54,126 --> 01:28:58,839
And the only thing we got
from our literary lives was enemies.

1339
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:02,550
He then came
with two bottles of Jack Daniel's

1340
01:29:02,634 --> 01:29:05,011
and started to browse my bookshelves,

1341
01:29:05,095 --> 01:29:09,224
and he noticed I had a lot
of books written by people we despised.

1342
01:29:11,393 --> 01:29:13,312
This text was written by Samuel Noyola.

1343
01:29:14,146 --> 01:29:16,773
"Out of our minds
due to an alcoholic frenzy,

1344
01:29:17,566 --> 01:29:19,860
we smacked them down."

1345
01:29:20,819 --> 01:29:22,529
Down the shelves, that is.

1346
01:29:23,113 --> 01:29:26,533
"Books of reflection, criticism,
and analysis."

1347
01:29:27,492 --> 01:29:31,329
"We also sentenced to the stake
kilos and kilos of newspapers,

1348
01:29:31,413 --> 01:29:35,834
photocopies and, behold,
some manuscripts from the author."

1349
01:29:35,918 --> 01:29:39,421
"'Those will be the first to burn,'
he had stated."

1350
01:29:49,431 --> 01:29:54,728
Let's see if this person
allows us to know where he really is.

1351
01:30:16,542 --> 01:30:19,336
In this terrible national tragedy,

1352
01:30:19,837 --> 01:30:26,009
we know that the people who disappear
are mainly victims

1353
01:30:26,093 --> 01:30:31,222
of this terrible circumstance
which is drug trafficking.

1354
01:30:31,306 --> 01:30:35,227
The political connotation
of the disappeared people,

1355
01:30:36,603 --> 01:30:40,899
which is the hard, vulgar,
shittiest part of all this…

1356
01:30:41,441 --> 01:30:43,860
I'd like to think
that didn't happen to him.

1357
01:30:43,944 --> 01:30:46,655
He wanted to disappear.

1358
01:30:47,781 --> 01:30:51,577
"Disappear" can be a very…

1359
01:30:52,452 --> 01:30:53,328
shitty word,

1360
01:30:54,037 --> 01:30:59,084
but disappearing can also be a poetic act.

1361
01:30:59,877 --> 01:31:03,880
Disappearing, man.

1362
01:31:03,964 --> 01:31:05,090
How did or does

1363
01:31:05,174 --> 01:31:07,759
the counterculture movement
see Samuel Noyola?

1364
01:31:07,843 --> 01:31:12,347
I think… Look, counterculture is not…

1365
01:31:13,223 --> 01:31:16,977
It's not a movement nor a political party.

1366
01:31:17,519 --> 01:31:20,522
Counterculture is an essence,
it's symbolic.

1367
01:31:21,148 --> 01:31:27,613
Counterculture is just an instant
in the movement of culture. Right?

1368
01:31:28,113 --> 01:31:31,199
When culture moves,
it becomes counterculture.

1369
01:31:31,283 --> 01:31:34,953
And I think we realize
that culture is dying

1370
01:31:35,037 --> 01:31:37,122
because it's more important to get rich…

1371
01:31:37,206 --> 01:31:40,834
It's more important
to idolize a drug dealer

1372
01:31:41,335 --> 01:31:43,086
than a poet.

1373
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:47,298
And anyone who says
"I'm part of the counterculture" is lying.

1374
01:31:47,382 --> 01:31:50,301
I'm not part of the counterculture,
fuck off.

1375
01:31:50,385 --> 01:31:52,262
This shirt is from Zara.

1376
01:31:52,846 --> 01:31:57,684
Those who don't care
about literature, poetry, philosophy,

1377
01:31:57,768 --> 01:32:01,688
those who only want
to be immediately happy,

1378
01:32:01,772 --> 01:32:04,232
those are the people who are right,

1379
01:32:04,316 --> 01:32:06,944
those are the ones who better fulfill

1380
01:32:07,736 --> 01:32:10,572
what's most important
for any living being,

1381
01:32:10,656 --> 01:32:13,951
which is our survival instinct.

1382
01:32:14,493 --> 01:32:19,373
Those who defy
their own survival instinct are idiots.

1383
01:32:20,582 --> 01:32:22,417
Like Samuel, right?

1384
01:32:24,795 --> 01:32:28,924
Happy people are the ones who are right,
aren't they?

1385
01:32:35,055 --> 01:32:35,931
But…

1386
01:32:44,231 --> 01:32:45,107
But…

1387
01:32:48,694 --> 01:32:51,154
Noyola was counterculture.

1388
01:32:53,574 --> 01:32:55,284
Noyola <i>is</i> counterculture.

1389
01:32:56,243 --> 01:32:58,328
Okay? Enough with this bullshit.

1390
01:32:59,621 --> 01:33:00,497
Okay.

1391
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:03,876
Enough.

1392
01:33:32,946 --> 01:33:35,324
The disappearance of Samuel Noyola

1393
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:39,786
meant the end of the chance to be,

1394
01:33:40,495 --> 01:33:42,289
almost in the 21st century,

1395
01:33:43,081 --> 01:33:44,291
in front of…

1396
01:33:45,876 --> 01:33:48,545
a passionate reciter…

1397
01:33:49,796 --> 01:33:50,672
a crazy man.

1398
01:33:52,466 --> 01:33:54,342
That kind of writer

1399
01:33:54,426 --> 01:33:57,429
would be totally ineffective nowadays.

1400
01:33:58,889 --> 01:34:00,224
And if the last century…

1401
01:34:01,517 --> 01:34:05,354
was very hard
on Samuel's life and character,

1402
01:34:06,104 --> 01:34:07,439
even when Octavio Paz was alive,

1403
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:12,402
the 21st century would be
absolutely intolerant of him.

1404
01:34:13,195 --> 01:34:14,404
If he suddenly came…

1405
01:34:16,073 --> 01:34:19,618
out of a sewer,
or jumped off a rooftop terrace,

1406
01:34:20,285 --> 01:34:23,746
truth be told, he'd find himself
in an even worse hell

1407
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:25,082
than the one he already lived in.

1408
01:34:28,001 --> 01:34:29,503
I wouldn't wish him that.

1409
01:34:41,014 --> 01:34:44,351
He's a person with many mysteries, right?

1410
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:48,438
He's a bit of a hermit.

1411
01:34:53,902 --> 01:34:54,778
He's alive.

1412
01:35:26,435 --> 01:35:27,311
I don't believe it.

1413
01:35:29,229 --> 01:35:31,523
I'm quite skeptical about that stuff.

1414
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:34,151
The tarot cards say that…

1415
01:35:34,985 --> 01:35:37,737
I think you've already read his books,
right?

1416
01:35:37,821 --> 01:35:38,822
Did he write three books?

1417
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:41,366
Did he?

1418
01:35:42,659 --> 01:35:45,787
I want you to notice the second book.

1419
01:35:48,916 --> 01:35:50,792
You should search

1420
01:35:51,627 --> 01:35:52,961
around the middle of the book.

1421
01:35:55,047 --> 01:35:56,924
<i>Arcano cero</i>,
which means "arcanum number zero."

1422
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:01,762
There you'll find
the answer you're looking for.

1423
01:36:07,935 --> 01:36:11,772
Well, <i>Arcano cero</i>
is one of his greatest poems.

1424
01:36:12,481 --> 01:36:15,275
Besides, the arcanum number zero
is a tarot card.

1425
01:36:17,611 --> 01:36:22,031
MY BLOOD BURST INTO MY WRITING

1426
01:36:22,115 --> 01:36:25,160
AN ARTIST AMONG MIRRORS AT A BAR

1427
01:36:25,244 --> 01:36:28,955
AN ALCHEMIST OF ALGEBRA AND SOUL,

1428
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:32,542
WHEN THEY PUSHED ME TO THE TEN

1429
01:36:32,626 --> 01:36:34,628
TO THE TEN

1430
01:36:36,672 --> 01:36:38,339
THE ZERO

1431
01:36:38,423 --> 01:36:42,343
I BARELY MANAGED TO SEE THE ZERO

1432
01:36:42,427 --> 01:36:45,638
THE GONG OF EMPTINESS

1433
01:36:45,722 --> 01:36:47,015
I JUMPED

1434
01:36:49,476 --> 01:36:51,019
I JUMPED

1435
01:37:57,377 --> 01:38:01,923
MY FLAME BURNED ON A LASCIVIOUS SUMMER

1436
01:38:02,007 --> 01:38:06,428
I GOT DRUNK
WITH THE WINE OF A SICK AUTUMN

1437
01:38:06,512 --> 01:38:11,391
WINTER CAME, DRUNK WITH MISERY

1438
01:38:15,896 --> 01:38:16,980
He wanted to leave.

1439
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:19,566
He asked to die.

1440
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:28,032
ZERO'S MERRY-GO-ROUND SPINS
AND THE SEA KEEPS SOUNDING

1441
01:38:28,116 --> 01:38:31,995
I NEVER FEEL ALONE
AMONG THE WAVES OF WRITING

1442
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:36,291
MY FLAME WANTS TO SWIM TO THE OTHER SHORE

1443
01:38:48,804 --> 01:38:50,180
But I can see…

1444
01:38:51,515 --> 01:38:53,141
he did everything he wanted.

1445
01:38:54,977 --> 01:38:57,437
But seeing him again? No.

1446
01:39:02,901 --> 01:39:05,111
For the record,

1447
01:39:05,195 --> 01:39:06,655
my gratitude

1448
01:39:07,781 --> 01:39:09,199
is…

1449
01:39:12,828 --> 01:39:13,787
And…

1450
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:18,542
I just want you to remember me a lot

1451
01:39:19,918 --> 01:39:20,836
and…

1452
01:39:29,636 --> 01:39:31,054
to laugh at me.
