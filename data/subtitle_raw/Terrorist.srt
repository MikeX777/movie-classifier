Sir!
Trainee Oh Soo-Hyun

3
00:01:12,786 --> 00:01:15,846
You're Inspector Oh's brother

You do resembIe

For the Iast time,

7
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:21,353
- in SeouI?
- No wondering around

8
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:24,152
- Daddy's words?
- Honesty. Sincerity

9
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:28,560
Right. Learn something useful
And live honestly

10
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:31,359
No. I want to be a police like you

11
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:34,162
Daddy wouldn't want it
From the heaven

12
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:38,865
StiII, I know I can be
A better poIice than you

13
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:53,644
You are my brother, right Soo-Hyun?

14
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:58,556
- Stop asking that
- That's because you make me happy

15
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:04,360
Not onIy because you're my brother
But this is so you

16
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:08,966
No hat when eating, my brother

17
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:14,338
Skipping schooI, fights
You were such troubIed student

18
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:19,845
But today, you at that award ceremony
CouIdn't beIieve it

19
00:03:19,913 --> 00:03:24,043
- Here, have a drink
- No soda pop?

20
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:29,043
Thinking about the younger years, huh?

21
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:35,157
Right. Those younger years

22
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:43,362
If not a cop
What wouId I have become?

23
00:03:43,403 --> 00:03:47,635
Knowing you, a street thug
Being chased by me

24
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:51,040
I couIdn't beIieve so much taIk about
You at PoIice Academy

25
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:56,344
- I'II break your fame
- Hey, is that a chaIIenge?

26
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:13,462
Academy's best score, huh?
Expecting a Iot from you

27
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,764
It's onIy the beginning, sir

28
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:22,037
A Iot of dead ends in our work
Breaking down our enthusiasm

29
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,545
- Expecting that sir
- Your brother's at the CentraI Precinct?

30
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:32,449
I heard a Iot about
Inspector Oh

31
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:34,953
Are we aImost there yet?

32
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:40,654

00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:45,358

Don't come cIose, I said

35
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,966
Don't come unIess you wanna die

36
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:53,564
I'II do it if you come cIose

37
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:55,541
He's a compIete nut case

38
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,541
Don't
Go ahead

39
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:09,048
Detective
Take him away

40
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,348
- Inspector
- Get out

41
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:14,360
- Can't do this to a reporter
- Get out

42
00:05:14,394 --> 00:05:16,760
Reporters have right
Not to be interrupted

43
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:19,856
- I'm saIes director here. Thank you
- You know them?

44
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:22,959
No, but I have an idea

45
00:05:24,204 --> 00:05:26,468
I've refused vending request
In the past

46
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:29,134
I see, we'II require the fuII story
At the questioning

47
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:31,734
OK. How about a drink...

48
00:05:57,404 --> 00:06:00,532
We received a caII

49
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:10,946
Who is this?
Inspector Han

50
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:12,952
What's going on here?

51
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:17,047
- I couIdn't deIay the construction, so I...
- Sit

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,958
Our business

53
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:27,866
Business shouId be taken care
In harmony

54
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:30,062
What's the probIem?

55
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:34,437
Vendors are aIready seIected
I have no authority to change...

56
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:40,935
AsshoIe. Why didn't Iet us

57
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:48,753
- Come
- Hey, Iet him go

58
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:06,372
Officer Oh!

59
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,040
Officers knifing peopIe these days?

60
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:38,762
PubIic figure using a knife

61
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:44,936
Give it to me

62
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:57,046
Are you pIaying with me?

63
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:02,150
Rookie?

64
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:06,957
CaIm down, shit head

65
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:16,641
Hey! Stop aII this

66
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:57,948
Freeze!

67
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:04,053
Raise your hands!

68
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:09,361
- Sir!
- Officer, is the paper ready?

69
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:11,363
- Yes

70
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:18,866
Get it!

71
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,639
Question them?

72
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:32,150
- Separate'em and push hard
- Yes, sir

73
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:37,748
It's important for you to find
Who's behind it

74
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,351
- Me?
- I'm going to see my brother

75
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:44,557
- He's been assigned the Iocation
- A cIose suburb

76
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:48,761
Haven't see him for awhiIe
I'II hurry back

00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:53,465
- Can you phone my home?
- Home?

78
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:58,341
TeII my wife
I'II disappoint her again tonight

79
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:04,345
You do that
Have fun!

80
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:10,851
- Wait
- Have to go

81
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,051
Interrupting reporting is
An iIIegaI act

82
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:15,151
Have a nice day

83
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:38,041
Just 1 2 hours
He isn't yet officiaIIy arrested

84

00:11:08,681 --> 00:11:13,345

89
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:30,062
I don't want to do this, brother

90
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:34,039
Mr. Straight

91
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:39,635
UnIess he's happy in the morning

92
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:43,842
Don't worry

93
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:48,049
- Hey
- What now?

94
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:53,553
Don't act so square
It's OK

95
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:56,653
I Ieave with you
A virgin

96
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:19,952
- I want to sIeep with you
- Then, sIeep

97
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:25,754
You know...
To be with you

98
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:07,566
Here

99
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:14,733
Listen carefuIIy, Soo-Hyun

100
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:18,743
I can't
FiII your cups anymore

101
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:22,542
No one
ProbabIy can

102
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:30,351
OnIy you can
Like the Iife ahead of you

103
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:35,349
PoIice station to the right
Bus terminaI to the Ieft

104
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:49,942
This choice is my Iast present for you

105
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:57,142
So Iong

106
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:15,863
Assertion of rightfuI defense
Was scrutinized

107
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:20,339
As the key dispute to decide
Whether guiIty or not

108
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:26,140
AIthough the accused and
The partner was threatened

109
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:30,842
By 1 0 assaiIants
It is acknowIedged that their action

110
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:36,048
Was to threaten but not to assauIt
The Iives of the accused

111
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:39,956
Thus, shooting to kiII
Without a warning shot

112
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:44,452
Is decided
As using excessive force

113
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:52,370
Therefore, under criminaI Iaw 21 -2
Of using excessive force

114
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:56,739
The accused is sentenced 3 years
With 1 0 years deprivation

115
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:59,437
Do you think excessive force
Decision is appropriate?

116
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:05,648
Why did you refuse a Iawyer?

117
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:08,654
Do you stiII justify your shooting?

118
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:11,555
Are you satisfied
With the pubIic defender?

119
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:13,752
WiII you appeaI?

120
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:18,162
Take care Soo-Hyun
Be strong

121
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:19,562
- It's Mr. Yim
- Where?

122
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,157
Back door

123
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:26,867
Why are you here?

124
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:31,741
Mr. Joe said he's the empIoyee then
Changed his mind did he fear revenge?

125
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:34,336
What's his reIationship
With the company?

126
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,349
- Is he our empIoyee ?
- No, sir

127
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:40,352
- Are you taking over the maII?
- No

128
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:43,753
If you are
When wiII that happen?

129
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:47,459
Just one more comment

130
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:51,361
Are you under officiaI questioning?
Or, just a reference?

131
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:55,362
Anything to comment?

132
00:15:57,403 --> 00:15:59,564
You know about Officer Oh's case?

133
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:01,736
Do you know Chairman Yim?

134
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:05,043
- WiII you teII us
- How you feeI now?

135
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,041
Won't you comment?

136
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:41,537
He's been sentenced 3 years

137
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:45,543
It' unbeIievabIe

138
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:49,350
It's his fate
But, it'II make our work harder

139
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:52,357
Bastards wiII be jumping
In joy right now

140
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:55,155
Yim's been Iet go?

141
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:59,358
My wish is
To see him go to jaiI for good

142
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:02,561
I don't think I'II see that
Before my time

143
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:08,437
<NW Group Data>

144
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:31,861
I've been chasing after
A man for Iong time

145
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,663
He's acting as
A Iegit businessman right now

146
00:17:37,703 --> 00:17:41,434
I beIieve his underground mob
Is behind your case too

147
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:44,340
I know

148
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:48,938
But this is my business now
Don't you worry

149
00:17:48,981 --> 00:17:51,643
You forget it
It's my business

150
00:17:54,387 --> 00:18:02,055
Sorry my brother, for being a burden
Don't come again

151
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:32,049
- So, how oId are you?
- 38

152
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:37,552
Too good of age to rot
At the maII, isn't it?

153
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:39,655
There's no end to greed

154
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:42,758
I guess I can't make you
Iike something

155
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:47,136
There's nothing to discuss further

156
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:52,143
- Goodness, it hot
- Take a dip in coId water

157
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:55,844
You're right

158
00:18:57,483 --> 00:19:02,352
CoId water is the answer
When hot and sweaty

159
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,566
Who's the victim?

160
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:54,338
- Find out anything?
- He's bare naked

161
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:56,533
No beIongs?

162
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:08,349
- Reporter Hwang!
- Off the record tiII the annoucement

163
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,066
Do you remember this guy?

164
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:27,038
- No
- AII right

165
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:29,336
May I see the member Iist?

166
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:33,435
- You know it's cIassified
- Right

167
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:43,448
- How about a cooperation, Captain?
- Cooperation?

168
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:49,860

You scratch my back, I scratch yours

Hey, you Iook aII right

Your brother seemed to
Be very busy these days

173

Hi

174
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:56,058
Let's go Soo-Hyun

00:21:56,895 --> 00:22:00,558

176
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:04,160
I wanna get washed up

177
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:08,640

178
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:13,644
Nothing personaI
I just feeI more comfortabIe at his pIace

179
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,347
Don't worry
I'II shine him up

180
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:20,648
See you Iater

181
00:22:28,494 --> 00:22:31,156
- Wait. Mr. Oh?
- Yes

182
00:22:31,196 --> 00:22:32,959
Can we taIk?
Just a few questions to ask

183
00:22:32,998 --> 00:22:35,762
Sorry
I've got nothing to say

184
00:22:38,203 --> 00:22:42,435
Sounds Iike your brother
Just the same

185
00:22:54,987 --> 00:23:00,653
Miss it?
It onIy gave you headache. Let's go

186
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:34,955
Irritated?

187
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:45,161
He toId me not to
But, I did it anyway...

188
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:53,338
I was sure
To become a better cop

189
00:23:53,412 --> 00:23:59,146
We aII have a dream
Then, Iife goes on

190
00:23:59,184 --> 00:24:01,448
Isn't Iife funny?

191
00:24:10,696 --> 00:24:14,462
Hey you
Catching up for the missing years in jaiI?

192
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,867

194
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:29,648
Anyway, stay untiI you get
Your own pIace, no worries

195
00:24:31,984 --> 00:24:33,747
No, thanks

196
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:40,757
That cheap shit pride
And, I got you a job too

197
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:46,760
- What the heII?
- Just a nick-nack

198
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,962
Something to do
During the spare time

199
00:24:54,907 --> 00:25:00,641
''Even if there's another chance''

200
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:02,340
Let's go

201
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:07,751
''I wiII not faII in Iove again''

202
00:25:47,492 --> 00:25:49,153
Move up!

203
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:53,563
Something wrong?
OnIy 6 trucks today

204
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:57,467
Orders been stopped
And the coordinator Ieft

205
00:25:57,502 --> 00:26:01,734
- I thought something's wrong
- We'II just take a few days off

206
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:04,037
- We're outta here
- OK. Take care

207
00:26:33,906 --> 00:26:36,932
Shit, PIaying is harder than working

208
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:44,440
Where's Mr. Nam?

209
00:26:44,483 --> 00:26:48,044
Nam?
Everyone's gone

210
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:51,146
What's going on, sir?

211
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:54,056
Aren't we the most creditabIe
In the market?

212
00:26:56,495 --> 00:27:01,364
Some thugs are threatening
And, goods owners are scared

213
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,459
Why don't you go to the poIice?

214
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:06,665
PoIice?
Accuse whom? On what charge?

215
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,344
ShouIdn't we Iook for
Another pIace?

216
00:27:17,382 --> 00:27:23,150
ProbabIy
But, I hate to be pushed around Iike this

217
00:27:23,488 --> 00:27:28,152
Better than being
Stepped on

218
00:27:28,193 --> 00:27:32,562
We shouIdn't...
Desert this pIace

219
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,763
Damn it!

220
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:53,149
- Workers here?
- Just contracts, what's up?

221
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:55,949
Wanna see...
The underground?

222
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:58,548
- Who the heII are you?
- Son of bitch!

223
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,754
There's nothing for you here
To suck on anymore

224
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:06,753
Get the heII out of here
Before I put a hoIe in your tummy

225
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:09,961
Oh, now you wanna stomp us around

226
00:28:10,002 --> 00:28:13,631
- Who are you?
- Why ask? Let's caII the cops

227
00:28:13,705 --> 00:28:18,540
What? CaII the cops?
Let's see you try

228
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,356
- Let go
- Enough. Come on

229
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:45,567
Let's go

230
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:48,038
Damn asshoIes

231
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:51,439
Hey, shouIdn't we caII the cops?

232
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:56,038
- It wiII just compIicate things for us
- They started

233
00:28:56,081 --> 00:29:00,950
That's what they wanted
We won't go free

234
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:05,154
- Damn it
- Get in

235
00:29:32,484 --> 00:29:34,349
Hey, go...
Go

236
00:29:56,808 --> 00:29:58,639
That's them

237
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,144
Stay back

238
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:20,860
Get'em

239
00:31:59,497 --> 00:32:01,362
PoIice!

240
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:22,348
When was it the Iast?

241
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:27,154
They stayed the Iast
Then, Ieft without a word

242
00:32:27,192 --> 00:32:28,750
Any outstanding wages?

243
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:31,956
1 0 days
MostIy off though...

244
00:32:31,997 --> 00:32:35,660
- Are they in troubIe?
- No

245
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,864
Strange. A cop was here earIier
Left a namecard

246
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:44,434
- Captain Oh, isn't it?
- You know him?

247
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,941
A famiIy...

248
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:48,937
Which way did they go?

249
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:55,852
That way
Then, I was occupied by the poIice

250
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:03,452
PIease caII me
If you see them again

251
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:06,364
Yes, sir

252
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:21,345
It's OK
StiII got the other

253
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:29,047
Your Iife is screwed now
To fiII my broken Ieg

254
00:33:37,996 --> 00:33:40,157
I wanna get outta here

255
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:44,560
Just a few more days
Doctor says not to rush it

256
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,642
- 732-91 95, know this number?
- Give it a caII

257
00:33:59,684 --> 00:34:02,653
- Who is it?
- Don't know, Just caII

258
00:34:19,404 --> 00:34:22,737
- HeIIo
- Someone page?

259
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:27,437
Soo-Hyun?
Where's Sang-ChuI?

260
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:30,539
Are you at a hospitaI?
Answer me

261
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:36,043
Why do you wanna know?
Just forget it. Bye

262
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:39,352
HeIIo?
Soo-Hyun!

263
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:48,457
- Did you caII?
- Wrong number

264
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,960
I know it's your brother
He's worried about you

265
00:34:53,004 --> 00:34:57,839
He gave me the pager
So, we can keep in touch

266
00:34:57,909 --> 00:35:02,346
- Go and ask for a job
- Enough. I can take care of myseIf

267
00:35:08,386 --> 00:35:12,652
Sorry. I'm stiII aII right

268
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,956
Not the right time
I can't go see him yet

269
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:23,761
We're in a dangerous situation

270
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:56,759
Man-Ri area, suite 203
OK

271
00:36:01,105 --> 00:36:03,130
I've got some work

272
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:47,145
- 5,000 with the discount
- Thank you

273
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:08,760
- WeII?
- Lost him

274
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:19,937
- How is he?
- LuckiIy missed the vitaI spot

275
00:38:20,011 --> 00:38:23,344
He'II need 3-week rest

276
00:38:24,182 --> 00:38:28,346
Can you remember his face?

277
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:35,951
You've seen him, haven't you?

278
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:40,363
I was stunned
You wouId've been the same

279
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:47,330
I gotta go to bathroom...

280
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:03,752
Somebody's eyeing our company

281
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:06,348
Heard some drivers are missing

282
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:09,155
Someone is iIIegaIIy conspiring

283
00:39:09,193 --> 00:39:13,061
Got this from someone
Who threatened us to Ieave

284
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:16,760
- Why didn't you caII the cops?
- He beat'em up

285
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:19,861
You know how he hates the poIice

286
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:22,834
You didn't even catch one?

287
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:25,740
It's no use catching the smaII timers

288
00:39:26,511 --> 00:39:28,741
<HS Logistics end of the month. Jung>

289
00:39:33,184 --> 00:39:37,143
NW Group distributed aIcohoIic
Beverages starting smaII in 1 977

290
00:39:37,188 --> 00:39:43,354
Construction in 80, retaiIing in 87
32nd biggest in 93

291
00:39:43,394 --> 00:39:48,354
Found something important
In the company and Chairman Yim

292
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:51,368
Here are reIated data and stories

293
00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:53,563
MainIy acquired
The bankrupt companies

294
00:39:53,604 --> 00:39:57,131
And it is certain that mob is invoIved

295
00:39:57,208 --> 00:40:03,443
Mob is aIso invoIved in suppIying,
Tendering and vending

296
00:40:03,981 --> 00:40:08,042
They go around by having
A third party acquiring

297
00:40:08,086 --> 00:40:11,351
And takes over haIf to one year Iater
To divert the Iaw

298
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:14,654
The fax you wiII see
Is an important cIue

299
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:16,956
Detective!

300
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:25,059
<HS Logistics. End of the month. Jung>
What's this?

301
00:40:25,103 --> 00:40:27,537
Chairman Yim has been
Dodging the Iaw so far

302
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:31,336
Because we couIdn't find
His direct mob invoIvement

303
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:34,037
Here is NW's organization chart

304
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:37,043
It's the IegaI advisor Mr. Jung

305
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:42,542
Does this directIy prove
Its mob invoIvement?

306
00:40:42,587 --> 00:40:48,457
No, sir
That's why I pIanned to investigate Yim

307
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:51,652
I'd Iike to have a chance

308
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:15,451
Even if that's true
These are oId cases... Too difficuIt

309
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:21,550
HS Logistics wiII bankrupt soon
NW is certain to takeover it

310
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:28,357
Can't move without a charge
Let's worry about pubIic peace

311
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:31,562
There are many unsoIved cases
That'II be aII

312
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:38,537
My caIIing... Unexpected?

313
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:43,842
HonestIy, a pIeasant surprise
I know it isn't a date, but...

314
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:53,055
This is next year's government
Construction projects

315
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,354
Investing iIIegaI tendering?

316
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:58,362
Chairman Yim won't pass up
The opportunity

317
00:41:58,396 --> 00:42:03,561
Upstairs won't Iet me
But, I'm gonna do it anyway

318
00:42:03,601 --> 00:42:06,661
I suppose you'II need to catch
The coIIusion scene

319
00:42:06,704 --> 00:42:09,332
Where shouId we meet?

320
00:42:11,008 --> 00:42:15,638
I've got some info
Let me handIe it first

321
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:19,346
PIease heIp me

322
00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:25,447
- Thanks for the dinner
- Anytime...

323
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:00,657
Thank you

324
00:43:00,691 --> 00:43:04,354
- Just us right?
- No doubIe pIay here

325
00:43:04,395 --> 00:43:06,556
Let me see

326
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,763
Ten aItogether
Rest after the tendering

327
00:43:12,803 --> 00:43:14,930
Has it been washed?

328
00:43:15,006 --> 00:43:18,032
CIeaned smaIIs

329
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:20,441
We shouId go

330
00:43:20,478 --> 00:43:25,745
- Thanks for the dinner
- Anytime...

331
00:43:29,387 --> 00:43:31,651
Not a peep to bring them down

332
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:36,353
Don't matter
Mr. Jung on tape is good enough

333
00:43:36,394 --> 00:43:38,362
We'II need more

334
00:43:38,396 --> 00:43:42,662
We've got 5 days
Is the crime scene photo possibIe?

335
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:10,051
- Hey, Iook at that
- The reporter from SeouI Newspaper

336
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:14,554
Stop it
Why is a SociaI Affair reporter here?

337
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:24,130
That's Detective Oh from the CentraI
Why is he here?

338
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:31,342
Radio him to overbid

339
00:44:31,382 --> 00:44:36,046
- Are we giving up?
- Idiot!

340
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:44,553
- How much Ionger?
- 45 minutes

341
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,162
NW Group is
The 3rd row on the Ieft

342
00:44:52,203 --> 00:44:54,831
- We'II need recording and photo

It's 1 00% truth

00:47:32,696 --> 00:47:36,063
Everything is confirmed and verified

358
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,763
We must consider this
You know something Iike this isn't...

359

You wiII be responsibIe
If this gets out?

Isn't this the asshoIe
Who took over HS Logistics?

372
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:41,661
That reporter...
Hasn't she got the guts?

373
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:44,361
That's for sure
WiII they be put away?

Don't resist, bitch!

Let go, you son of bitch!

384
00:50:57,501 --> 00:51:00,163
Umm. Nice body

385
00:51:58,695 --> 00:52:03,462
It's smaII and noisy
But, make yourseIves at home

386
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,867
- Don't you change your mind
- Get some rest

387
00:52:10,007 --> 00:52:12,134
Bosom buddy
He's aII right

We hung out at pooI haII together
Now he owns one

00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:28,458
Is it my brother?

This...
Can you Ieave it with me?

391
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,459

393
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:31,650
Going somewhere?

394
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:37,349
- Gotta see someone

395
00:53:38,795 --> 00:53:40,456
Go to bed earIy

396
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,864
And, don't worry

397
00:54:41,091 --> 00:54:43,355
We've gotta taiI

00:54:53,704 --> 00:54:59,142
Hey, you wanna die asshoIe
Stop the car

400
00:55:20,897 --> 00:55:22,956
Wasn't that the worker
At HS Logistics?

00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,458
I remember him
Get the tooIs

402
00:55:38,682 --> 00:55:40,445
I see your trade of speciaIty

403
00:55:40,484 --> 00:55:43,146
You'd better say your prayers

404
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:01,830
The scar on my Ieft
Who is it?

405
00:56:04,508 --> 00:56:05,941
Exchange for your head?

406
00:56:06,009 --> 00:56:10,343
Choon-Woo. Nothing to do with us

407
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:14,840
- Where?
- Dog-farm in Gwang-Myung

408
00:56:14,885 --> 00:56:19,754
- Who ordered him?
- Just kiII me

409
00:56:21,692 --> 00:56:29,360
If you wanna Iive
Keep your mouth shut and hide

410
00:57:33,396 --> 00:57:35,455
Nine Iives, huh?

411
00:57:36,099 --> 00:57:38,465
Who ordered you?

412
00:57:40,403 --> 00:57:44,339
You wanna exchange
Your head for a name?

413
00:57:44,407 --> 00:57:46,341
Mr. Jung

414
00:57:46,409 --> 00:57:51,142
You have right to know before you die
It's Chairman Yim

415
00:57:51,181 --> 00:57:53,046
Meet him after you die

416
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:43,059
You want one on the right side, too?

417
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:17,048
Finish your Iife as a dog-butcher

418
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:36,163
Why are you stiII up?

419
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:40,636
Hey... Your eyes
What happened?

420
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:48,040
Sit down

421
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:54,146
No, forget it!

422
01:02:56,386 --> 01:02:58,354
Don't worry

423
01:03:03,393 --> 01:03:05,657
It'II aII stop someday

424
01:03:29,486 --> 01:03:31,351
I'm scared

425
01:03:33,389 --> 01:03:35,448
What if something
ReaIIy bad happens?

426
01:03:38,995 --> 01:03:43,955
Chain of recent vioIence
Has got Chairman Yim busy

427
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,438
Two mobs are crippIed
And one's in criticaI condition

428
01:03:49,506 --> 01:03:51,133
Who's behind it?

429
01:03:51,207 --> 01:03:54,335
Don't have the suspect right now

430
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:56,641
Where have these happened?

431
01:03:56,679 --> 01:04:00,342
Two in the metro
The other at a suburb

432
01:04:00,383 --> 01:04:02,544
How do you pIan to proceed?

433
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:07,352
Each precinct wiII investigate
We'II coordinate from here

434
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:12,657
MainIy by putting surveiIIance
Around Yim and Jung

435
01:04:12,695 --> 01:04:15,357
We'II need time
As they are quiet movers

436
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:18,959
Put together an investigation
PIan and a team

437
01:04:20,503 --> 01:04:22,528
Remember the 'Swordsman Joe' case?

438

439

442
01:04:55,104 --> 01:04:59,734
- Send him to me
- OK. Ain't I not a cop, too?

443
01:04:59,809 --> 01:05:04,041
OnIy if he ain't so bossy
He'd be an aII right guy

444
01:05:40,883 --> 01:05:43,443
Haven't seen that reporter
From SeouI Newspaper...

445
01:05:43,486 --> 01:05:45,647
Don't know, sir.
She hasn't been repIaced either

Sang-ChuI went with 3 guys

Went? Not forced?
Right. Exchanged a few words...

Sang-ChuI

484
01:12:24,387 --> 01:12:26,355
Sang-ChuI

485
01:13:03,793 --> 01:13:05,454
He's dead

486
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:05,739

But you know I've things to do,
Don't you?

01:15:34,176 --> 01:15:40,547
Law is far away...
Fist is cIose at hand

490
01:17:10,406 --> 01:17:13,637
You're aIways hiding away
Into the dark

491
01:17:15,477 --> 01:17:19,641
Something wrong?
I've caIIed many times

492
01:17:22,184 --> 01:17:24,948
No. Nothing's wrong...

493
01:17:40,803 --> 01:17:43,328
This isn't good...

01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:19,564

01:21:02,704 --> 01:21:04,934
Remember me?

516
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:09,935
Son of bitch!
Pushing your Iuck, I see

517
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:15,643
Thanks for saving
My time by coming by

518
01:21:15,984 --> 01:21:17,952
Let's step out

519
01:21:18,987 --> 01:21:20,545
Let's do that

520
01:21:57,593 --> 01:21:59,857
Freeze!

521
01:22:59,588 --> 01:23:01,146
Freeze!

522
01:23:35,891 --> 01:23:40,157
I knew it was you

523
01:23:50,005 --> 01:23:53,941
Stop here
It's not your war

524
01:24:03,385 --> 01:24:05,546
Arrest me

525
01:24:07,389 --> 01:24:09,357
Listen carefuIIy

526
01:24:09,391 --> 01:24:16,058
When we meet again
We're not brothers anymore

527
01:24:49,998 --> 01:24:52,967
- HeIIo
- Miss Hwang. This is Yim

528
01:24:53,001 --> 01:24:55,333
- I have a roII of firm
- Yes?

529
01:24:55,404 --> 01:24:58,134
It's in my possession...
How about at 8 o'cIock?

530
01:24:58,206 --> 01:25:03,439
- Why meet? Send it
- I won't force it

531
01:25:10,185 --> 01:25:18,354
I read SeouI Newspaper daiIy...
But no apoIogies

532
01:25:18,393 --> 01:25:20,361
Give it to me

533
01:25:20,395 --> 01:25:26,061
You know that crazy dog

534
01:25:27,102 --> 01:25:29,332
Give me the fiIm

535
01:25:29,404 --> 01:25:33,135
You're not denying
Not yet

536
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:35,836
That defaming story of yours

537
01:25:35,877 --> 01:25:38,937
Do you know how much it cost us
To cooI things down?

538
01:25:40,182 --> 01:25:42,047
Aren't you going to hand it over?

539
01:25:42,083 --> 01:25:47,043
Nice pictures
Nice body

540
01:25:47,088 --> 01:25:51,855
FiIthy bastard
You want more. You want it here?

541
01:25:51,893 --> 01:25:56,557
- You bitch
- Let her go. Stand back

542
01:26:01,102 --> 01:26:03,127
I Iike your bitch-ness

543
01:26:03,205 --> 01:26:08,734
There's fashion show 7pm on 25th
I wanna buy you a dress

544
01:26:08,777 --> 01:26:13,043
- This is an officiaI invitation
- You mean bastard

545
01:26:18,987 --> 01:26:23,356
I understand that you couIdn't say it
I sympathize the pain

546
01:26:23,391 --> 01:26:29,853
Your brother's been named
The suspect

547
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:32,958
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir

548
01:26:33,602 --> 01:26:38,335
You'II get the chance to expIain
At the hearing

549
01:26:38,406 --> 01:26:41,034

How's my brother doing?

You shouId stop here
No reason to...

01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,436
I feeI assured because
You are there for my brother

554
01:27:09,504 --> 01:27:11,734
That's what I wanted to say

555
01:27:16,177 --> 01:27:17,838
Soo-Hyun

556
01:27:20,682 --> 01:27:26,143
When a friend went away, I said
'Distant Iaw, cIose fist'

557
01:27:27,389 --> 01:27:30,449
I know this isn't the right way

558
01:28:37,392 --> 01:28:41,761
Chief in PubIic WeIfare, Oh Sa-Hyun

559
01:31:00,401 --> 01:31:01,834

565
01:32:56,384 --> 01:32:58,147

570
01:38:13,991 --> 01:38:16,991
A small fish with a big dream
