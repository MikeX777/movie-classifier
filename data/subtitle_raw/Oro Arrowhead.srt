00:42:15,504 --> 00:42:16,537
That was the first

704
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,239
interesting thing you said.

705
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:19,673
Sorry, I can't.

706
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:22,877
My secret
has to stay with my tribe.

707
00:42:23,611 --> 00:42:26,047
Oh, yeah?
What tribe are you with?

708
00:42:27,248 --> 00:42:28,549
Major Jim Powell.

709
00:42:29,617 --> 00:42:32,820
75th Ranger Regiment
at your service.

710
00:42:33,354 --> 00:42:36,223
Wonderful. US military.

711
00:42:36,357 --> 00:42:38,359
Well, I'm not here

712
00:42:38,492 --> 00:42:40,061
on official
business, ma'am.

713
00:42:40,194 --> 00:42:43,164
My, uh,
my father just passed away.

714
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:46,434
Sorry to hear that.

715
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,569
Yeah, thanks. Ah.

716
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:50,704
Thanks for that.

717
00:42:52,273 --> 00:42:53,340
Powell.

718
00:42:54,608 --> 00:42:55,876
I knew a Powell,

719
00:42:57,111 --> 00:42:58,979
-Gerald Powell.
-Yeah.

720
00:42:59,514 --> 00:43:02,249
That was my dad!
Did you know him?

721
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:05,186
He sought after me

722
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:08,255
and wanted
to know about the area.

723
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,827
Cherokee lore and legends.

724
00:43:13,494 --> 00:43:14,762
Oro?

725
00:43:16,565 --> 00:43:19,568
Yes, Major Powell, Oro.

726
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,502
Gold.
White man's greed.

727
00:43:21,635 --> 00:43:24,004
Whatever you want to call it.
It's still the same thing.

728
00:43:24,138 --> 00:43:27,174
[solemn flute instrumental]

729
00:43:27,308 --> 00:43:31,212
Can you tell me
everything you told him?

730
00:43:35,517 --> 00:43:36,784
1838.

731
00:43:37,751 --> 00:43:40,555
President Jackson
sent troops and militia

732
00:43:40,688 --> 00:43:42,591
to forcibly
remove the Cherokee

733
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:44,725
and other tribes
from their homelands.

734
00:43:46,093 --> 00:43:49,463
My great great grandparents

735
00:43:49,598 --> 00:43:51,866
lived in that land

736
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:54,101
before the Great Spirit
breathed life.

737
00:43:55,236 --> 00:43:56,704
They were
forced from their homes

738
00:43:56,837 --> 00:43:59,473
to walk thousands of miles,

739
00:43:59,608 --> 00:44:01,142
having to bury their family

740
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:03,010
along the way
in shallow graves

741
00:44:03,144 --> 00:44:05,246
because the ground
was too frozen

742
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:06,981
and the soldiers said

743
00:44:07,114 --> 00:44:09,283
it took
too long to bury them.

744
00:44:10,552 --> 00:44:11,952
Trail of Tears.

745
00:44:13,721 --> 00:44:15,823
Not America's
finest moment in history.

746
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:18,025
One of many.

747
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:19,994
Oro?

748
00:44:21,195 --> 00:44:23,030
[laughs]

749
00:44:23,164 --> 00:44:24,633
Right.

750
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:25,799
The gold.

751
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:27,701
You know, 3,000 of us

752
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:29,504
died on that trail

753
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:31,305
-all for some--
-Sorry.

754
00:44:34,742 --> 00:44:36,210
I didn't mean to interrupt.

755
00:44:37,278 --> 00:44:38,345
Please continue.

756
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,347
Please.

757
00:44:43,117 --> 00:44:45,152
So you know
about the Trail of Tears.

758
00:44:45,286 --> 00:44:47,221
Did you know
that the Cherokee found gold

759
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:49,558
in Dahlonega
10 years earlier?

760
00:44:49,723 --> 00:44:51,792
Really? My dad.

761
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,496
He used to take my sister
and I down to Dahlonega,

762
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:56,897
pan for gold.

763
00:44:58,132 --> 00:45:00,100
Never knew
the Cherokee found it.

764
00:45:01,268 --> 00:45:04,271
Yes,
my great great grandfather

765
00:45:04,405 --> 00:45:06,307
was one of the tribesmen
that found it.

766
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:10,077
Knowing
white man's desire for gold,

767
00:45:10,211 --> 00:45:11,546
he and the other tribesmen

768
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,281
started mining it and hid it.

769
00:45:14,415 --> 00:45:16,183
And then word got out

770
00:45:16,317 --> 00:45:19,654
and people started to swarm
the area for their fortunes.

771
00:45:19,787 --> 00:45:22,624
Anybody ever find the gold

772
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,425
that your
great great grandfather did?

773
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:25,893
No.

774
00:45:26,528 --> 00:45:28,495
Because President Jackson

775
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,764
passed the Indian Removal Act

776
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:33,133
and the leaders got together

777
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:36,036
and decided to hide it,
to never be found.

778
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,138
So you know where it is?

779
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:40,941
Is that a, uh,
family secret

780
00:45:41,075 --> 00:45:44,378
that's passed on
for generations?

781
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:48,282
You hear
about thousands of people

782
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,185
forcibly removed
from their rightful homelands

783
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:53,087
and it's like,
"Oh, that's such a sad story.

784
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,055
I'm sorry
to hear about that".

785
00:45:55,189 --> 00:45:56,924
Then you hear about
a gold mine and it's like,

786
00:45:57,057 --> 00:45:58,693
"Oh, hey, yeah,
show me the money".

787
00:45:59,393 --> 00:46:01,395
No, I just want to find out
what happened to my dad.

788
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:03,063
I could tell you
what happened to him.

789
00:46:03,197 --> 00:46:05,065
-He was murdered.
-What?

790
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:07,334
How?

791
00:46:07,468 --> 00:46:09,837
He wasn't
the only one looking for it.

792
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:13,007
SABAL: With what I'm paying you,

793
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,409
I expect results,
not excuses.

794
00:46:15,543 --> 00:46:17,411
If I wanted excuses,
I'd still be married

795
00:46:17,545 --> 00:46:18,912
to my second husband.

796
00:46:19,046 --> 00:46:22,016
How hard can it be
to find one man?

797
00:46:22,149 --> 00:46:24,151
He took
all of Gerald's research.

798
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:27,788
You find him
or you won't be found.

799
00:46:29,557 --> 00:46:31,058
[grunts]

800
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:34,194
That idiot is the reason
we had to get rid of Gerald.

801
00:46:35,262 --> 00:46:36,531
[grunts]

802
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:40,067
That old man
knew too much.

803
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,468
Go back to the compound.

804
00:46:41,603 --> 00:46:42,870
If Gort heard something,

805
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:44,305
I want to know
what it is.

806
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:45,507
Yes, Miss Fade.

807
00:46:50,144 --> 00:46:52,880
[digital tone plays]

808
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:54,783
Hey Sabal.

809
00:46:54,915 --> 00:46:57,051
You don't look happy.
Again.

810
00:46:57,184 --> 00:46:59,420
I'm surrounded by idiots.

811
00:46:59,554 --> 00:47:00,954
Talk to them.

812
00:47:01,088 --> 00:47:03,490
I refuse to have a battle
of wits with unarmed men.

813
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:06,060
-Well, talk to me.
-We've got a problem.

814
00:47:06,193 --> 00:47:08,162
I thought
we got rid of the problem.

815
00:47:08,295 --> 00:47:10,264
No, not him. His son.

816
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:13,434
He came for the funeral.
He's been poking around.

817
00:47:13,568 --> 00:47:14,902
How much does he know?

818
00:47:15,035 --> 00:47:17,071
I'm not totally sure.

819
00:47:17,204 --> 00:47:19,473
We almost had him the other day
but then he disappeared.

820
00:47:19,607 --> 00:47:21,342
I could have
Donia there in two days.

821
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:23,745
-She can find him.
-No, not yet.

822
00:47:24,713 --> 00:47:27,314
I think we've been
going about this all wrong.

823
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:29,116
We've been
getting rid of the competition.

824
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:32,286
Maybe we just
need to get out of their way.

825
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:34,388
I think
you're taking a big chance.

826
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:36,357
Well,
when and if he finds anything,

827
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,192
we can just
take it from him.

828
00:47:38,325 --> 00:47:39,493
True.

829
00:47:39,627 --> 00:47:41,830
If anything goes sideways,
let me know.

830
00:47:41,962 --> 00:47:43,263
I will.

831
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:50,638
[forest din]

832
00:47:50,772 --> 00:47:52,172
JIM: So who is
this Sabal Fade?

833
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:54,241
-And why'd he kill my dad?
-GOLA: She.

834
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:56,176
JIM: You think
I care about pronouns?

835
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,045
Why did it kill my dad?

836
00:47:58,178 --> 00:48:00,280
That's closer
to the truth.

837
00:48:00,414 --> 00:48:01,516
She's not human.

838
00:48:01,649 --> 00:48:04,251
She killed my uncle
and anyone else

839
00:48:04,385 --> 00:48:06,855
who'd take up the search
to find what my ancestors left.

840
00:48:06,987 --> 00:48:08,690
Does she have
people looking?

841
00:48:08,823 --> 00:48:09,858
Always.

842
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:11,091
They're all around town,

843
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:12,560
threatening families,

844
00:48:12,694 --> 00:48:14,863
trying to squeeze
information out of people.

845
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:17,197
She bought up
the land and businesses,

846
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:18,867
trying to corrupt
the politicians.

847
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:20,702
She'll do
anything and everything.

848
00:48:20,835 --> 00:48:23,671
Explains why people
were treating me so weird.

849
00:48:23,805 --> 00:48:25,640
I just don't understand
why dad would take up

850
00:48:25,774 --> 00:48:28,175
something so dangerous
and not tell me about it.

851
00:48:28,308 --> 00:48:29,811
I could have helped him.

852
00:48:29,943 --> 00:48:31,746
Protection, probably.

853
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,180
The woman is pure evil.

854
00:48:33,313 --> 00:48:34,481
And she'll
stop at nothing

855
00:48:34,616 --> 00:48:35,983
to get what she wants.

856
00:48:36,116 --> 00:48:38,085
Sounds like she has
enough money already.

857
00:48:38,218 --> 00:48:40,421
It's about the power,
not the gold.

858
00:48:40,555 --> 00:48:41,623
JIM: Right.

859
00:48:42,423 --> 00:48:44,224
Wait, what? What power?

860
00:48:48,663 --> 00:48:49,963
Gola.

861
00:48:51,098 --> 00:48:53,300
-GOLA: Got it.
-Got who?

862
00:48:54,836 --> 00:48:56,303
GOLA: Breakfast.

863
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:02,409
How do you
like your squirrel?

864
00:49:02,544 --> 00:49:03,678
I don't.

865
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:07,481
I prefer beef

866
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:08,716
or deer.

867
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,217
You ever had squirrel?

868
00:49:10,752 --> 00:49:13,053
JIM: My dad and I
used to go camping all the time.

869
00:49:13,187 --> 00:49:15,690
And when we did,
we always hunt.

870
00:49:17,859 --> 00:49:21,228
I learned a lot
but I never had to eat squirrel.

871
00:49:22,262 --> 00:49:24,097
-Let me guess, though.
-Please don't say "chicken".

872
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:25,900
Tastes like chicken.

873
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:27,535
So predictable.

874
00:49:27,669 --> 00:49:29,136
Really?

875
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:34,408
Did you know
I was going to do that?

876
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:35,910
Well?

877
00:49:36,043 --> 00:49:37,745
You lied.
Tastes like chicken.

878
00:49:39,647 --> 00:49:40,748
You were saying.

879
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:43,050
What?

880
00:49:43,885 --> 00:49:45,385
Before you went
all squirrel hunter on me,

881
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,522
you were saying
something about power.

882
00:49:48,021 --> 00:49:50,625
I asked grandmother, Elisi,
