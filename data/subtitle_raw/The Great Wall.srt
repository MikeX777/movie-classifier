1
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:29,759
The Great Wall has
stood for centuries

2
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:32,970
as one of mankind's
most enduring wonders.

3
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:47,610
It spans over 5500 miles

4
00:00:47,652 --> 00:00:50,238
and took more than
1700 years to build.

5
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:59,414
It protected from many dangers.
Some are known. Some are legend.

6
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:04,544
This is one of the legends.

7
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:22,061
THE GREAT WALL

8
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,463
Najid, cut the horses loose.

9
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,059
We have to turn back.

10
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,273
We have been riding
for six months.

11
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,274
And we've lost 20 men.

12
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,730
But we survived.

13
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,694
Yes. By chance.

14
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:10,112
Any one of us could have
met that same fate.

15
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,275
We were the strongest.

16
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,282
Remember why you're here.

17
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:18,199
In the West, we would be enemies,
and I would have to kill you.

18
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,117
At least here, we
have a common goal.

19
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,409
Oh, yes.

20
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,086
This black powder.

21
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,585
It turns air into fire.

22
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,376
And kills a dozen men at one time.

23
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,381
It is the weapon of our dreams.

24
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,962
And what if it's just a myth?

25
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,973
Men have sent word that it's real.

26
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,262
And those men are dead.

27
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,718
And we are next.

28
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,678
We have no maps,

29
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,146
no medicine

30
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,389
and no food.

31
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,145
No one is going back.

32
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,187
We take inventory of
what we have left

33
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,481
and finish what we started.

34
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,658
There's not much here.

35
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,693
The moon is strong.

36
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,820
When the horses are
fresh, we move.

37
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,780
- To where?
- North.

38
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,413
If they keep after us, we'll
kill them in the mountains.

39
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,911
The magnet.

40
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,710
Too heavy.

41
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:08,957
Useless. I'll have it.

42
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,127
It's all yours.

43
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,970
Amigo, only you would carry a
stupid magnet through the desert.

44
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,645
I can use it to make a compass.

45
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,521
Rizzetti won't make it.

46
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,521
The wound is festering.

47
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,109
We'll be dragging a corpse.

48
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,283
I heard that.

49
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,361
He's earned the right
to die where he wants.

50
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,909
I've been left for dead twice.

51
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,158
It was bad luck. For who?

52
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,959
The people who left me.

53
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,957
Maybe Rizzetti's right.

54
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,108
Where are they?

55
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,868
Hill tribes?

56
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,873
It's no man.

57
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,876
Then what is it?

58
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,714
Whatever it is, it's hunting.

59
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,431
What was that? I don't know.

60
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,603
I took its hand.

61
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,102
- We need to move.
- Agreed.

62
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,479
I'll take the hand with us.

63
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,855
What the hell for?

64
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,150
So someone can tell me
what I just killed.

65
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,968
Persistent bastards, aren't they?

66
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,639
We'll take the rise,
make a stand there.

67
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,472
What a long shitting
way to go to die.

68
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,142
Mother of God.

69
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,814
I have no need to
go down fighting.

70
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,399
Agreed.

71
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,403
I say we take our chances with
the gents in front of us.

72
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,064
I haven't surrendered in a while?

73
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,114
It'll come back to you.

74
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,706
Follow my lead, we'll be fine.

75
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,872
Of course, my friend.

76
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,711
Where you go, I follow.

77
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,713
You're doing such a
great job already.

78
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:27,258
All Commanders to the Great Hall.

79
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:28,776
All Commanders report
to the General.

80
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:33,238
Make way. Make way.

81
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,456
All Commanders to the
Great Hall. Make way.

82
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:45,529
Commander Lin is
needed immediately.

83
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,053
Calling Commander Lin.

84
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:51,390
Commander Lin is
needed immediately.

85
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,135
They know what it is.

86
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,632
And they don't look
happy to see it.

87
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,465
All the more reason to get
the hell out of here.

88
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,513
Our weapons are on that table.

89
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,145
Have you lost your mind?

90
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,643
I can take out the guards on
the perimeter with my bow.

91
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,433
You cut the legs out
from under the officers.

92
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,149
I must confess, this is
not my favourite plan.

93
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,571
Where was this found?

94
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,822
You speak English.

95
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,493
Fantastic.

96
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,499
Where was this found?

97
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,001
It wasn't found.

98
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,829
It was taken.

99
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,210
That thing killed three men
before we took it down.

100
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,415
Where?

101
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,842
Two days ride.

102
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,353
North, in the mountains.

103
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,457
He says two days ride
north, in the mountains.

104
00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:54,544
- They claim to have killed it.
- Two days?

105
00:09:54,785 --> 00:09:57,073
Earlier than we expected.

106
00:09:57,177 --> 00:09:58,308
Strategist Wang.

107
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:03,527
- I'm listening, General.
- The two of them killed it?

108
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,573
Two of you, you did this?

109
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,574
Well...

110
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,902
I killed it.

111
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,403
Alone?

112
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:16,478
He claims to have killed it alone.

113
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:18,769
- By himself?
- Impossible.

114
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,163
Tell me how.

115
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,711
A swing of the sword.

116
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,881
The hand, it came away clean.

117
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,929
The beast fell back into a chasm.

118
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,098
Why are you here?

119
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,933
We came to trade.

120
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,018
We were ambushed.

121
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,237
Guards.

122
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,234
You are soldiers.

123
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:57,339
Commander Lin. Wait.

124
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,962
General. They claim to be
traders who were ambushed.

125
00:11:12,146 --> 00:11:16,401
- These barbarians are liars.
- Perhaps not.

126
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,613
They brought the claw
here. The wound is fresh.

127
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,660
There is green blood on his
sword. Those prove his story.

128
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:33,084
To protect our secret,
we must kill them.

129
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,377
Eliminate the
possibility of trouble.

130
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:36,429
I agree.

131
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,880
We should kill them.

132
00:11:40,258 --> 00:11:44,345
General, until we find the truth,

133
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:47,344
I advise we keep them alive.

134
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:48,368
Alert.

135
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:54,647
General, signals from the smoke
towers. We are under attack.

136
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:56,816
Take them to stockade.

137
00:11:56,858 --> 00:12:01,403
- All stations on full alert.
- All stations on full alert.

138
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,619
Are you killing us, sister?

139
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,838
Two lost travellers?

140
00:12:27,095 --> 00:12:30,974
What's happening here, amigo?
Is this bitch going to kill us?

141
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,136
I think she'd like that.

142
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,432
If it is death, my dear,
we need time to pray.

143
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,225
I'm trying here.

144
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,810
Sister, I know a siege
when I see one.

145
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,976
What comes at you so hard
you need a wall like this?

146
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,899
What the hell did
we kill out there?

147
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,521
Tao Tei.

148
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,532
You killed a Tao Tei scout.

149
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,984
You killed it alone.

150
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,826
You're correct.

151
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,324
We are under siege.

152
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,703
But we did not expect the
attack for another nine days.

153
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,038
Attack? Tao Tei.

154
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,412
What the hell is a Tao Tei?

155
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,790
Many things about your
story have importance.

156
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,750
You are not to die today.

157
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:18,619
Hurry.

158
00:13:18,622 --> 00:13:21,843
- I'm sorry, sir. I
cannot find the key.

159
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:25,511
Forget it. Bring them to the
Wall. Keep an eye on them.

160
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:37,874
- General. It's finally happening.
- Yes.

161
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,877
Sixty years preparing
for this moment.

162
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:56,893
Stop. Stop.

163
00:13:58,145 --> 00:14:01,273
Go. Go.

164
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:04,358
Inside.

165
00:14:41,437 --> 00:14:43,564
Stand still.

166
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:10,633
Get down. Get down.

167
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,834
The black are the foot soldiers.

168
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,126
And the red?

169
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,419
Those are the archers.

170
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,904
And the blue?

171
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,484
They're all women.

172
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,819
What the hell do they do?

173
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,040
Look at this army.

174
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,876
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

175
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,586
Incredible.

176
00:16:48,313 --> 00:16:50,023
Catch it.

177
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,362
They look nervous.

178
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,241
It's a big wall to be so nervous.

179
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,174
Do you hear it?

180
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:37,827
- Long distance weapons.
- Yes.

181
00:17:37,862 --> 00:17:40,365
Drums signal long
distance weapons.

182
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:53,420
Grab it.

183
00:17:57,507 --> 00:17:59,217
Light it.

184
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,713
Aim for the eyes.
Aim for the eyes.

185
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:59,359
Crane Corps attack.

186
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,412
William, over there.

187
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,923
Why isn't he tied up?

188
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,877
There's our escape.

189
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:34,954
General, there is the
Queen. She commands them.

190
00:20:34,996 --> 00:20:36,956
Attack the Queen.

191
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,245
- Close combat.
- Yes. Close combat.

192
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,289
Drums signal close combat.

193
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,972
We need to move.

194
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,679
We need to move or we die.

195
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,697
Go, go.

196
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,533
Go and fight.

197
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,758
Cut me loose.

198
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,547
Fight or run?

199
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,631
Run where?

200
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,226
Aim for the eyes.

201
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,637
William.

202
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,087
Hey. Bitch.

203
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,312
William.

204
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,810
I need a shot.

205
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,697
What god made those things?

206
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,537
None that we know.

207
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,223
Think they'll hang us now?

208
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,430
I could use the rest.

209
00:25:35,211 --> 00:25:37,004
You fought well today.

210
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,755
You've earned General
Shao's praise.

211
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,419
Will they come back?

212
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,541
Yes.

213
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,753
All we can do is prepare.

214
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:49,547
Take them to the barracks.
They need rest.

215
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,034
Yes.

216
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:20,131
Thank you for saving my life.

217
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,575
Commandeer Lin. You grew
up in the Nameless Order.

218
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,619
I've taught you many things...

219
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:57,083
And you have been learning,

220
00:26:58,084 --> 00:26:59,188
but they have been learning also.

221
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:00,628
Strategist Wang warned
they are evolving.

222
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,298
No one listened.

223
00:27:04,632 --> 00:27:06,641
The enemies we're facing today

224
00:27:06,676 --> 00:27:09,179
are more intelligent
than sixty years ago.

225
00:27:11,973 --> 00:27:14,913
Watch the foreigners closely.
They can never leave.

226
00:27:14,948 --> 00:27:17,127
We must protect the
secrets of the Wall.

227
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:18,128
Yes, sir.

228
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,937
Who are you?

229
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,023
Easy.

230
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,910
I'm Ballard.

231
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,242
William.

232
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,494
This is Tovar.

233
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,418
What are you doing here?

234
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,542
We came looking for black powder.

235
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,874
I bet you did.

236
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,710
I came with mercenaries
for the same thing.

237
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,420
Twenty-five years ago.

238
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,384
And did you find it?

239
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:56,676
Finding it and leaving with it
alive are two different things.

240
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,690
You saved the west turret.
That was extremely diplomatic.

241
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,733
We weren't being diplomatic.

242
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,527
We were trying to stay alive.

243
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,775
- You smell like animals.
- Thank you.

244
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:19,665
Clean up

245
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,330
and they'll feed you.

246
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,547
He knows where the powder is.

247
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,796
Then why is he still here?

248
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,086
He needs help getting out?

249
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,712
Right.

250
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,431
We play our part,

251
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,518
take the powder and go home.

252
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,391
I didn't sign up for this.

253
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,559
Which part?

254
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,484
Well, all of it. But
mostly the monsters.

255
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,774
There's a lot of them.

256
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,196
We really do smell.

257
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,398
General Shao welcomes
you as honoured guests

258
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,695
of the Nameless Order and thanks
you for your skill and courage.

259
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,363
We are honoured to be honoured.

260
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,158
Is that the best you've got?

261
00:29:48,295 --> 00:29:50,005
General.

262
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:53,675
I couldn't help wondering,

263
00:29:53,717 --> 00:29:58,180
why would such an accomplished
archer, use such a primitive bow.

264
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,018
Commander Chen thinks your bow

265
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,891
is not worthy of your skill.

266
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,848
Tell him there's no
better weapon here.

267
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:10,734
He claims his weapon
is second to none.

268
00:30:14,822 --> 00:30:18,325
Let him show us.
Give him some space.

269
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,580
They wish to see you shoot.

270
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,077
In here?

271
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:32,506
Unless he is afraid.
It's a large audience.

272
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,340
What was that?

273
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,675
He thinks you have fear.

274
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,508
Too many people.

275
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,095
Get one of the cups.

276
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,510
- Now?
- Get one of the cups.

277
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,594
I want to eat.

278
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,644
You remember how to do this?

279
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,989
Last time didn't go so
good. We were drunk.

280
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:58,774
How high?

281
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,784
Ten yards. Six hands to the right.

282
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,032
Turn around.

283
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,447
No, I'll do it this way.

284
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,498
On my count. Amigo...

285
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,158
One.

286
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,284
Two.

287
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,624
Three.

288
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,707
Pull.

289
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,664
Good luck with that.

290
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,500
I want food.

291
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,046
Who taught you English?

292
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,669
Sir Ballard.

293
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,127
English and Latin.

294
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,339
Heard he's been here for 25 years.

295
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,470
You won't let him leave.

296
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,309
He must stay here.

297
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,135
What about us?

298
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:13,769
Pace yourself.

299
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,317
The meals are regular here.

300
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,857
I hope not to stay that long.

301
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,396
I like your thinking,

302
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:22,320
but I suggest you keep
your plans private.

303
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,322
You aren't the first Westerners

304
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,324
to come here looking
for black powder.

305
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,665
We'll discuss it tonight.
Bring your partner.

306
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,250
How long have you been here?

307
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,414
Always.

308
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:36,630
I was not five years
old when I came here.

309
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,882
I have no other family.

310
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,713
We're the same.

311
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,762
I was given to an army
before I can remember.

312
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,134
As a soldier?

313
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,057
Worse. As a gleaner.

314
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:51,012
Packs of children, we'd
clean the battlefields.

315
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,188
After, when the fighting's over.

316
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:56,563
I became a page, a
pikeman's boy...

317
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,606
For your country?

318
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,401
No. I fought for food.

319
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,948
You fight to eat.

320
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,531
You live long enough,
you fight for money.

321
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,822
How many flags do you fight for?

322
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,871
I don't know.

323
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,287
I fought for Harold
against the Danes.

324
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,757
I saved a Duke's life. I
fought for him until he died.

325
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,919
Fought for Spain
against the Franks.

326
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,925
Fought for the Franks
against Boulogne.

327
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,798
I fought for the Pope.

328
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,764
Many flags.

329
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,103
We are not the same.

330
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,783
Meet me on the Wall. I have
something to show you.

331
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,619
He should be careful with her.

332
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,290
She's very powerful here.

333
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,830
Then it is a fair contest.

334
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,462
Come.

335
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,893
You wish to try?

336
00:34:26,196 --> 00:34:28,824
Men are too heavy. Do you
think we can pull him up?

337
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,826
She says men have so
much to teach us.

338
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,168
I don't think that's
what she said.

339
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,299
You know what I think?

340
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,376
I think you're afraid.

341
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,839
You said that this morning.

342
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,090
And yet,

343
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,685
here I am. Yes.

344
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:57,975
Here you are.

345
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,657
Will you jump? Or not?

346
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,541
These men know what they're doing?

347
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,708
Wrong question.

348
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,674
Whether or not the
cable is attached,

349
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,801
that is the question.

350
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:35,805
And the answer?

351
00:35:35,806 --> 00:35:37,308
Trust.

352
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,101
Xin ren.

353
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:40,389
Xin ren.

354
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:45,144
Xin ren means trust.
To have faith.

355
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,776
Here, in this army,

356
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:52,067
we fight for more
than food or money.

357
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,615
We give our lives
to something more.

358
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,907
Xin ren is our flag.

359
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,292
Trust in each other.

360
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,418
In all ways, at all times.

361
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,188
Well, that's all well and
good, but I'm not jumping.

362
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,608
I'm alive today because
I trust no one.

363
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,941
A man must learn to trust

364
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,482
before he can be trusted.

365
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,574
Then you were right.

366
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,073
We're not the same.

367
00:36:41,747 --> 00:36:44,250
Stay vigilant. The
next attack is coming.

368
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,925
My God.

369
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,345
A taste, a glimpse.

370
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,106
A few pilfered grains
from Strategist

371
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:59,265
Wang's supply of black powder.

372
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:04,811
He's mastered the transmutation
of these elements.

373
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,270
People speak of a weapon.

374
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,151
There are many weapons here.

375
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,606
Why have we not seen them?

376
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,906
There are many things
you have not seen.

377
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:16,360
And many things you should
pray will not be needed

378
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,904
before the siege is through.

379
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,992
The Tao Tei will return.

380
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,545
When the drums call to battle,

381
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:31,125
the guards leave their posts and
take their positions on the Wall.

382
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,840
That is our moment.

383
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,220
We want to be riding away

384
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,681
as the battle rages.

385
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,891
And the armoury
doors? You have keys?

386
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,810
I have black powder.

387
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,857
Enough for several doors.

388
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,855
He brings us in. We get us out.

389
00:37:50,732 --> 00:37:52,567
Strategist Wang
requests your presence.

390
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,868
As you fought, where
was this stone?

391
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,370
In my bag.

392
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,241
Its unseen force is powerful.

393
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,708
I believe this strange
stone could help us.

394
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,506
We try everything.

395
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,878
Where are the Tao Tei now?

396
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,425
The mountains, regrouping.

397
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,675
Where do they come from?

398
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,390
About 20 centuries ago,

399
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,388
there was an emperor
whose greed brought

400
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:29,310
deep suffering to all of China.

401
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,686
The heavens sent the meteor
that struck Gouwu Mountain,

402
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:36,106
turning it green and
releasing the Tao Tei.

403
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:40,197
From that day on, the Tao
Tei rise every 60 years

404
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,113
to scourge the north of China.

405
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:48,911
They come to remind us of what
happens when greed is unchecked.

406
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:52,581
They eat anything, alive or dead,

407
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,875
and take food to their queen.

408
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:58,261
She depends on her
soldiers to feed her.

409
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:03,141
Only with the food they provide
is she able to multiply.

410
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:10,475
The capital, and its two million
people, is only 800 Li away.

411
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:14,315
If the Tao Tei ever had
that much nourishment,

412
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,777
no corner of the
world would be safe.

413
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,782
You can't hunt them?

414
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,151
Men try.

415
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,656
They disappear.

416
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,408
We never find their bones.

417
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:29,872
Troops unaccounted for
at the West Tower.

418
00:39:47,181 --> 00:39:49,558
Why did they leave the bodies?

419
00:39:51,185 --> 00:39:52,895
Dismount.

420
00:39:53,812 --> 00:39:55,481
Formation.

421
00:40:23,675 --> 00:40:25,386
Advance.

422
00:41:25,111 --> 00:41:26,821
Stop.

423
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:36,372
Commander Lin.

424
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:39,375
General...

425
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:42,712
They led us into a trap.

426
00:41:43,171 --> 00:41:45,631
We underestimated
their intelligence.

427
00:42:00,371 --> 00:42:02,571
The Nameless Order...

428
00:42:04,174 --> 00:42:06,073
is yours to command.

429
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,536
General...

430
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:10,073
Commanders, this
is my final order.

431
00:42:12,992 --> 00:42:15,078
From this day forward,

432
00:42:15,578 --> 00:42:20,875
Commander Lin will lead you.

433
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,339
The soldiers of Nameless
Order will stand firm.

434
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:30,093
The Wall must not fall. We
will defeat the Tao Tei.

435
00:42:30,426 --> 00:42:34,138
- Rest in peace.
- Rest in peace.

436
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,154
This is envoy Shen
from the palace.

437
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:19,829
He has brought important records
to help with the coming battle.

438
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:23,716
This is 900-year-old
battle report.

439
00:44:24,517 --> 00:44:26,223
A 900-year-old battle report.

440
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,508
At the Hansha gates,

441
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,674
three beasts mounted the Wall.

442
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:36,600
They killed many men
as they went forward.

443
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:40,352
Then, by the grace
of the ancient gods,

444
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,764
the beasts stopped...

445
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,937
and sat peacefully as
we slaughtered them.

446
00:44:48,983 --> 00:44:52,012
There was a magnet on
site just like this one.

447
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:56,611
At the Hansha Gate, was a
magnet just like this one.

448
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:01,416
I believe that magnet was the
reason that two of you Westerners

449
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,584
killed the Tao Tei so easily.

450
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:08,002
I believe the magnet
makes the Tao Tei deaf.

451
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,547
Without instruction,
they fall still.

452
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:15,706
How to prove it?

453
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:17,048
How can we be sure?

454
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:19,891
Why not try it?

455
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,644
Capture a Tao Tei.

456
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,975
See if it works.

457
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:25,933
He wants to try. He
wants to catch one.

458
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:27,642
How?

459
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,769
No net is strong enough.

460
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:32,067
Hunt them. Like a whale.

461
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,240
You know what that is.

462
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,362
A water beast.

463
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,157
Hundred times the
size of a Tao Tei.

464
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:42,892
A spear that grabs. Hook
the bone. Pull them up.

465
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:46,954
Use a spear, hook them.
So we can catch them.

466
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,710
I've seen it done in Spain.

467
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:53,377
He claims to have seen
it done it Spain.

468
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,675
What the hell are you doing?

469
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,384
We need to be free
when the attack comes.

470
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,886
How many chances do you
think we will get?

471
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,264
Be injured. Be
missing. Be a coward.

472
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:07,974
Get out of this.

473
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,522
We did enough.

474
00:46:20,237 --> 00:46:23,574
The mixture must be strong to
put the creatures to sleep.

475
00:46:29,246 --> 00:46:31,874
- Spread it on evenly.
- Yes, Commander.

476
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:09,245
Snap out of it.

477
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,355
Useless idiot. Report
to the kitchen

478
00:47:28,356 --> 00:47:30,140
- where you belong.
- Yes, Commander.

479
00:47:30,175 --> 00:47:31,850
Go.

480
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:04,965
He'll be here.

481
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,222
- When?
- When it's over?

482
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,053
We start and he will find us.

483
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,183
Start?

484
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,977
We're jumping off a cliff here.

485
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,985
I have everything.
Powder, tools, maps.

486
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,150
It's all hidden and
arranged along the route.

487
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,564
Once we start,

488
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,196
there's no going back.

489
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:11,533
- Death Squad ready.
- Yes. Death Squad go.

490
00:49:14,703 --> 00:49:17,497
Blades ready.

491
00:49:22,419 --> 00:49:25,034
Blades forward.

492
00:49:25,037 --> 00:49:28,176
- Attack.
- Go.

493
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:36,724
Left. Right.

494
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,388
- I'll find him.
- Forget him.

495
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,266
He'd rather die trying to
impress the new general than

496
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:16,059
grab the key to every counting
room and brothel in the world.

497
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,770
Good God, man. The time is now.

498
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,567
I can't go without him.

499
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,061
More the spoils for us.

500
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,146
We need his bow.

501
00:50:27,516 --> 00:50:28,584
Harpoons.

502
00:50:28,587 --> 00:50:30,289
Harpoons, now.

503
00:50:35,482 --> 00:50:36,992
Fire.

504
00:51:17,749 --> 00:51:18,789
- There.
- Move.

505
00:51:19,392 --> 00:51:21,012
It's the last one.

506
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,812
Pull.

507
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,187
No, no, no. Stop.

508
00:51:49,188 --> 00:51:50,189
Hold.

509
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,442
There's too much tension.

510
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,858
Chain will break.

511
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,661
That way. That way.

512
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:55,989
Let him run.

513
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,410
Stop. Stop.

514
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,879
We need longer for the
sleeping potion to work.

515
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,543
That way. That way.

516
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:14,090
We need to isolate it.
Separate it from the others.

517
00:52:14,091 --> 00:52:16,799
- Ring of fire.
- Yes. Ring of fire.

518
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,827
The chain won't hold much longer.

519
00:52:35,232 --> 00:52:36,232
We're losing it.

520
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,209
William, wait.

521
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:48,206
- Screaming arrows.
- Yes. Screaming arrows.

522
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:53,137
These arrows will scream
as the Tao Tei run.

523
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:55,760
Aim for the sound.

524
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:11,437
Aim inside the circle.
Blanket the whole area.

525
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,318
Fire.

526
00:53:56,982 --> 00:53:58,692
Pull.

527
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,427
I'm only saving you so
I can kill you myself.

528
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:27,231
Grab an axe, we're fighting blind.

529
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,863
Not yet. I know what to do.

530
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,281
The fire's not holding them back.

531
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,401
Die well, brother.

532
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,655
What the hell are you doing?

533
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,906
She's listening.

534
00:55:24,027 --> 00:55:28,532
- Prepare black powder weapons.
- Prepare black powder weapons.

535
00:55:34,621 --> 00:55:36,296
Prepare to light the fuses.

536
00:55:36,331 --> 00:55:38,500
Yes. Prepare to light the fuses.

537
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,509
Did it work?

538
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:07,182
Yes. The beast was captured.

539
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:10,219
My friend...

540
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,183
He was unharmed.

541
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,192
Why did you go over the Wall?

542
00:57:28,943 --> 00:57:30,569
Xin ren.

543
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,876
Did I say it right?

544
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,208
Thank you.

545
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,473
Black powder.

546
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,227
It is a terrible weapon.

547
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,898
It would be better if
you had never seen it

548
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:04,365
I know very little of
the outside world.

549
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,525
But it seems to me,

550
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:10,078
the greed of men is not that
different from the Tao Tei.

551
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,573
Is that true?

552
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,535
The strong take what they want.

553
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,927
Forget what you have seen.

554
00:59:18,701 --> 00:59:22,291
Excellent. Send it to the
capital immediately.

555
00:59:22,294 --> 00:59:23,356
No.

556
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:24,948
We need to study it here.

557
00:59:24,949 --> 00:59:27,568
If Tao Tei is captured alive,
it must be sent to the Emperor.

558
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:29,729
This is an Imperial Order.

559
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:56,343
You're much braver
than they think.

560
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,631
You wounded?

561
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,052
I was looking for you.

562
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,134
To say thank you.

563
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:40,721
You feel good, huh?

564
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,145
Maybe you sing a little song?

565
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,940
I will join you.

566
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:50,234
We can sing together how you
saved the grateful chinos.

567
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,778
You saw what happened out there
and that's what you say?

568
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:53,991
I see black powder.

569
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,071
I see a man forget his friends.

570
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,705
The black powder's
not going anywhere.

571
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,875
What goes nowhere is you.

572
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,960
You'll never get what
you want from this.

573
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:11,426
You think they see you
as some kind of hero?

574
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,594
A man of virtue?

575
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,507
Maybe you can fool them,

576
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,592
but I know what you are.

577
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:22,267
You know what you are.

578
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,648
A thief,

579
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,566
a liar,

580
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,274
and a killer.

581
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,363
And you can never undo the
things you have done,

582
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,068
and you will never be anything.

583
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,454
Good to see you again, amigo.

584
01:01:57,751 --> 01:02:00,928
Tao Tei movement.

585
01:02:00,963 --> 01:02:04,717
All troops to the Wall.

586
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:10,440
- Nothing?
- No.

587
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,770
How do you know he
won't betray us?

588
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:12,979
I don't.

589
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,815
They'll kill him. They'll
kill him no matter what.

590
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,866
The time they spend killing him

591
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,157
is time they are not chasing us.

592
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,369
Careful with that.
There's powder here.

593
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:19,046
Tovan

594
01:03:49,654 --> 01:03:51,125
General, it goes all
the way through.

595
01:03:51,126 --> 01:03:52,365
Tao Tei have breached the Wall.

596
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,534
They're smarter than we thought.

597
01:03:54,742 --> 01:03:57,282
Summon my commanders immediately.

598
01:03:57,283 --> 01:03:58,413
Yes, General.

599
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,115
Have a look. See if it's gone out.

600
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:22,609
Is it safe?

601
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,278
Of course it is.

602
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,517
Shake it off, man. To work.

603
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,197
I thought you said it was safe?

604
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:03,700
We're in, aren't we?

605
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:16,914
You're here.

606
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,044
We've come to our senses?

607
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:20,959
Ballard has planned well.

608
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,919
Getting out is easy.

609
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,346
There's a gate. 20 miles west.

610
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:27,348
We dodge the hill tribes.

611
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:29,509
We can make it.

612
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,011
They need us here.

613
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:33,893
They need more than us.

614
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:36,191
These people are doomed.

615
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,354
Don't be a fool.

616
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,475
I've been a fool.

617
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,270
I'm done with it.

618
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,197
Brother, please.

619
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,358
We've been fighting for nothing.

620
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,489
For greed.

621
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:51,247
Amigo, after all the blood,

622
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,825
and cold, and pain,

623
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,328
with this black powder
in our saddle bags,

624
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:57,913
we win.

625
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:00,422
You come with me.

626
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,460
I can't do that now.

627
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:06,717
Stay and fight.

628
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,383
William...

629
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,020
Think he's dead?

630
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,144
It'd take a lot more than that.

631
01:06:20,386 --> 01:06:22,247
All of the attacks have been a

632
01:06:22,248 --> 01:06:24,730
diversion, while they
dug this tunnel.

633
01:06:24,765 --> 01:06:28,417
They have breached the
Wall. Once they reach the

634
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:31,772
capital, nothing in the
world can stop them.

635
01:06:32,773 --> 01:06:36,492
At a full gallop, it's
2 days to the capital.

636
01:06:36,527 --> 01:06:38,976
There is no way we can catch them.

637
01:06:38,977 --> 01:06:40,698
The wind is strong now.

638
01:06:41,115 --> 01:06:43,318
It blows from the north all day

639
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:46,162
tomorrow. We have to
use the balloons.

640
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:48,385
If it works, how
long to Bianliang?

641
01:06:48,386 --> 01:06:50,166
Six hours if the wind holds.

642
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:51,959
If we make it alive.

643
01:06:53,101 --> 01:06:56,563
General, none of the
tests have worked.

644
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:59,050
Get ready.

645
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:10,444
Come on.

646
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:11,991
Hyah.

647
01:07:20,696 --> 01:07:25,618
THE CAPITAL BIANLIANG

648
01:07:59,944 --> 01:08:03,555
- How did you capture it?
- Your Excellency.

649
01:08:04,697 --> 01:08:09,619
It's the magnet. It keeps the
beast under the control.

650
01:08:09,703 --> 01:08:12,062
This is the most
important discovery

651
01:08:12,063 --> 01:08:14,040
in the history of the Tao Tei.

652
01:08:14,107 --> 01:08:16,029
We will investigate immediately.

653
01:08:16,589 --> 01:08:17,609
Bring him here.

654
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:38,205
I tried to stop them...
You dare to speak to me?

655
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,451
I didn't do this.

656
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:45,039
And you came here to trade.

657
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,047
And you knew nothing
of black powder.

658
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,677
What a fool you must think I am.

659
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:54,006
If I was with them,
why would I be here?

660
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:55,180
I tried to stop them. I tried...

661
01:08:55,181 --> 01:08:56,708
Liar.

662
01:08:57,884 --> 01:08:59,261
You lie.

663
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:03,022
Some part of you knows
that's not true.

664
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:08,024
If I were not the General,
I would kill you myself.

665
01:09:09,721 --> 01:09:11,765
General.

666
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:18,772
- General.
- Speak up.

667
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:24,861
I was there when it happened.
I saw him try to stop them.

668
01:09:33,286 --> 01:09:34,996
Are you sure?

669
01:09:37,582 --> 01:09:40,168
If you're lying,
I'll have your head.

670
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:44,463
I swear on my vow to
the Nameless Order.

671
01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:59,972
Lock him up. Send the
cavalry. Go after

672
01:09:59,973 --> 01:10:02,107
- the two that got away.
- Yes, General.

673
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,975
Which way, left or right?

674
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:32,441
Go up and take a look
from the high ground.

675
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,992
Hyah.

676
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:48,418
No.

677
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,498
No. Bastard.

678
01:11:32,696 --> 01:11:34,826
- Keep it steady.
- Yes, General.

679
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:37,370
- Watch the powder.
- Yes, General.

680
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:14,164
What happened?

681
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:18,380
What happened?

682
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,344
We have failed.

683
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:22,926
The Tao Tei are in the Kingdom.

684
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:26,931
You are free to leave.
Take what you wish and go.

685
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:29,099
This was the General's
final order.

686
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:30,392
Where is she?

687
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:36,398
To do what?

688
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:37,603
To fight?

689
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:39,025
Is there a chance?

690
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:40,272
There's only one.

691
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,775
Kill the Queen.

692
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,032
Kill the Queen, or we all die.

693
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:47,955
Leave.

694
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,625
Tell the world what you have seen,

695
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,873
and tell them what is coming.

696
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,519
I'll need my bow.

697
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:23,821
If I'm to join you,
I'll need my bow.

698
01:13:29,453 --> 01:13:34,249
Strategist Wang. Please
take me with you.

699
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:37,417
He wishes to join us.

700
01:13:59,258 --> 01:14:01,949
Distance is the key.
The magnet is only

701
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:04,305
effective when close to the beast.

702
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:09,393
Therefore, the effect weakens
as it gets further away.

703
01:14:09,435 --> 01:14:11,770
You see I have it under
complete control.

704
01:14:15,149 --> 01:14:16,859
Write down nine feet.

705
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:32,949
No.

706
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,030
No.

707
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:39,702
No.

708
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:45,583
No.

709
01:15:47,126 --> 01:15:50,130
No, don't throw that
thing near fire.

710
01:16:04,841 --> 01:16:08,720
- Steer to the rear of the palace.
- Yes. To the rear of the palace.

711
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:10,752
Above you.

712
01:17:18,789 --> 01:17:20,916
- Light a grenade.
- Yes, sir.

713
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:26,567
Behind you.

714
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,748
I set you free.

715
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,083
And here I am.

716
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:45,911
There's the Queen.

717
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:53,298
They will not attack while
the Queen is feeding.

718
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:55,342
We have a chance.

719
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:56,513
Hold on.

720
01:18:10,807 --> 01:18:12,517
State your purpose.

721
01:18:27,329 --> 01:18:29,998
General Lin Mae of the Nameless
Order. At your service.

722
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:39,636
What took you so long?

723
01:18:39,677 --> 01:18:42,263
The Tao Tei have overrun the city.

724
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:46,358
Thousands of soldiers
and innocents are dead.

725
01:18:46,359 --> 01:18:47,506
You're too late.

726
01:18:48,164 --> 01:18:50,308
Your Majesty, where is
the captured Tao Tei?

727
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,731
- In the dungeon.
- We need to kill the Queen.

728
01:18:52,746 --> 01:18:56,214
Once she is dead, the Tao
Tei cannot function.

729
01:18:56,297 --> 01:18:59,133
Without her signal, their
whole army will freeze.

730
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:20,347
There is an underground
canal here.

731
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:22,349
Has it been breached?

732
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,926
The Tao Tei should
all be above ground.

733
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:25,852
And the one we captured?

734
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:27,346
We load it up.

735
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:29,815
We feed it.

736
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,858
And it will return to its Queen.

737
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:33,059
Good.

738
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,552
You'll have one hell of a
scar, but you'll live.

739
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:46,467
He says you will live.

740
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:49,391
We'll come back for him.

741
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:08,872
They've broken through.

742
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,991
Patience, William.

743
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:54,061
And it will go to the
Queen when it's done?

744
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:55,520
It should.

745
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,103
It will.

746
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:12,070
Let it in.

747
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,433
I can get a shot from above.

748
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:44,774
Go. I'll hold them back.

749
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:09,295
Wait. Not yet.

750
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:18,978
Hit.

751
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:29,146
Go higher.

752
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:30,657
I'll get a better shot.

753
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:44,955
General.

754
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:46,335
It's up to you now.

755
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:40,844
We have one black
powder weapon left.

756
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:42,395
Give me the spear.

757
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:46,024
I've trained for
this my whole life.

758
01:25:47,964 --> 01:25:48,964
Trust.

759
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:54,191
I'll get you the shot.

760
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,617
I've got you.

761
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,618
So, how's life without me?

762
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:04,283
A little slow.

763
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:09,159
You're a hero after all.

764
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:10,953
Well, it looks that way.

765
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:13,380
You seem pleased with yourself.

766
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:15,878
And what are they giving you
for all of your troubles?

767
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,042
A bag of gold?

768
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:19,799
A victory parade along
the top of the Wall?

769
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:22,301
All the black powder I can carry.

770
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:25,600
And a cavalry escort
to get me home safely.

771
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:28,061
Well, congratulations.

772
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,979
Thank you.

773
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:33,355
So what is this? You're
here to rub my nose in it?

774
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:34,980
Well, would you blame me?

775
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,438
The last time I saw you,
you left me for dead.

776
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:39,485
And the time before that,
I saved your life.

777
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:40,907
True.

778
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:45,829
You know, the Emperor
gave me a choice.

779
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:48,123
I could take the black powder,

780
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:50,625
or I could take you.

781
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:54,420
Please tell me you
chose the powder?

782
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:03,388
I don't even know you any more.

783
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:07,718
The horses are
saddled and waiting.

784
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:10,099
Best we ride before nightfall.

785
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,273
I'll be inside.

786
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,229
Don't leave without me.

787
01:29:29,948 --> 01:29:31,120
I came to say goodbye.

788
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:36,705
I understand congratulations
are in order.

789
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:39,125
General of the
northwest territory.

790
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:40,964
That's quite an honour.

791
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:45,589
Seems you've made your choice.

792
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:46,806
Him?

793
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:48,524
Believe me, I'm already
thinking about

794
01:29:48,527 --> 01:29:49,846
trading him back for the powder.

795
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:51,978
I heard that.

796
01:29:57,642 --> 01:30:00,771
Perhaps we were both wrong.

797
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:03,987
We are more similar
than I thought.

798
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:11,372
Thank you, General.

799
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:39,355
Are you sure you don't
want to go back?

800
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:41,019
Of course I do.

801
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:44,690
I just don't trust you to
make it out of here alone.
