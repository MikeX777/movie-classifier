1
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:30,812
"Late at night we drift alone."

2
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:34,713
"It's all that we have ever known."

3
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:37,304
"Still I hear you calling me."

4
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:39,037
Hi. - How about your trip to Mars?

5
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,008
Very funny.
There was a long queue of ladies.

6
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:43,569
In that case,
I should have been there.

7
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:46,045
Hello. There was a queue of ladies,
not of gents.

8
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,401
Scoundrel. - Correct.

9
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:49,639
Okay. Okay. Okay.

10
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:51,337
Can you not waste any more time?

11
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:52,903
There have been only three rounds.

12
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,913
I want to be smashed tonight.

13
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:56,640
I am with you in that.

14
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,646
Is it my farewell or
your farewell? - Yours.

15
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,735
Exactly.

16
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,302
We are getting liquor
for free. - Look.

17
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,438
I am not mad that I will waste time.
- Point. Point.

18
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:05,405
Just in case you have forgotten.

19
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:06,468
I am still here.

20
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:08,945
Seriously, Neel.
Today you will get a hefty bill.

21
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,240
Hold on. Hold on. - Yes.

22
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,507
This is the last bill he is
paying in India. He will pay. -Yes.

23
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,547
Cheers to the next Indian idol.
- Cheers.

24
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:17,541
Next American idol please.
- Cheers, guys.

25
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,271
That's music to my ears.
- Everybody bottoms up.

26
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,368
Bottoms up.

27
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:29,905
I don't think you
should drink anymore.

28
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:32,777
I am so happy I am going
away from you guys. - Oh God!

29
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:34,676
Hi. - Look, who is here. - Hello.

30
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,235
Hello, gorgeous. - Thank you.

31
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,608
Sit. Sit. - Finally.

32
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,711
It's your best friend's
farewell party.

33
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:41,541
And you are walking in now.

34
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,804
Shame on you, Neena.

35
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,710
Maggie, you know how it is.

36
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:47,247
First things first. Will you drink?

37
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:51,608
I am not drinking today. - Oh my!

38
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,506
Oh Gosh! Not again.

39
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:57,376
Man, someone please
take her away from here.

40
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,273
I can't tolerate such oldies.

41
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:03,276
Guys, will someone tell me
why am I friends with this aunt?

42
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:05,242
Maggie, don't force me tonight.

43
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,380
Don't force her tonight, Maggie. Okay?

44
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,476
You know that tomorrow
morning I have to wake up early"

45
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,478
...and go for work.

46
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,240
So who is stopping you?

47
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:14,804
Don't sleep till tomorrow
it's as simple as that.

48
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,840
Guys, I don't know anything.

49
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,181
We have come together
after a long time.

50
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,577
No one is sleeping tonight.

51
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:23,212
No one is sleeping tonight. - Yes.

52
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:28,380
Till the first ray of daybreak,
the show must go on. - Right.

53
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:29,810
How many has she had? - Waiter.

54
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:32,245
She is not drinking anymore.
- Where is Magesh?

55
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,574
This show stopper. .

56
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,474
He will again make a
grand entry today. Just see.

57
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:36,944
Hold on. - Looking good, Neena.

58
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,372
Thank you.

59
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,402
Idiot, where are you, man?

60
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:44,644
The idiot is here.

61
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,642
What's up? - Hey!

62
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,873
How are you? - You are late.

63
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,580
What's up, man?
- Hi. - Congratulations.

64
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:54,842
Finally, you are leaving.
You have left us here to rot.

65
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,772
Seriously, Neel.
Take me also with you.

66
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,211
I am bored of this place.

67
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,644
How sweet, baby!

68
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,373
So much love for me. Did you see?

69
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,546
All of you have settled
down after college.

70
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,875
When will my big moment come?

71
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:11,874
I am tired of waiting.

72
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:16,238
Neel, you are going to US.
Take this hero with you.

73
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:17,673
He is a big bore.

74
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:20,670
Yeah, dude.
At least he will leave us alone.

75
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,408
Once you become a famous singer..

76
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,107
...find a small role for
him in Hollywood. - Perfect.

77
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:30,243
If he had to do a small role, he
would have done it a long time back.

78
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,504
How sweet! Hello. Hold on.

79
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:37,638
Where's the booze?
We were drinking, right? Hello.

80
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,178
Yeah, man.
Come on. - Where is my booze?

81
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,234
I will have one too.

82
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,677
One for Neel.

83
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,144
But I want one more.

84
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:47,379
Okay. Here is to the shots.

85
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:50,380
Cheers. Cheers.
- Cheers. Cheers to Neel.

86
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:51,844
Really. I am not drunk yet, man.

87
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,212
Lets have a look on Vikram Narula's case"

88
00:06:57,267 --> 00:07:01,238
...which became popular.

89
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,481
It has been officially closed down.

90
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:09,106
You must remember when well-known
builder Vikrant Narula..

91
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:12,808
"Committed suicide, there
were many rumors making the rounds.

92
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:17,079
Some say that he committed
suicide as he was debt-ridden.

93
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,706
And some say that the
room from where he jumped..

94
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,240
...many people have died in that room.

95
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:25,812
It's a strange story.

96
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:30,343
CID can make five
episodes on this mystery.

97
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,740
What case is this?

98
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,645
How come I don't know about it?

99
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:35,707
It's about that hotel.

100
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:37,205
What hotel?

101
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:39,537
Hotel Grandiose.

102
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,136
The one in news.

103
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:43,374
Since the time strange incidents
have been occurring there"

104
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,140
"the hotel has been shut down.

105
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:50,072
The owner committed
suicide or he died.

106
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,278
Nobody knows.

107
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,244
Since then all this is going on.

108
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,074
But poo!' QUY-

109
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,673
No one knows how
and why that owner died.

110
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,043
You never know the truth.

111
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:04,171
I have heard strange
stories about that hotel.

112
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,672
So have I.
I have heard that hotel is haunted.

113
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:09,607
Yeah. - Many people say
there is 'Vastu Shastra' problem.

114
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:12,440
But personally,
I don't quite believe it. - No. No.

115
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:17,148
I have heard that in the hotel,
room number 3046..

116
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,975
...where the man committed suicide"

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,002
...many years ago
a girl had died there.

118
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,977
Ditto. I have also heard this story.

119
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,074
Exactly. - Come on.

120
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,606
And before dying,
she had invoked a curse.

121
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,737
What? - That whoever
comes to that building..

122
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:34,173
"She won't spare him.

123
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:35,634
Correct. - Yeah.

124
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,606
Oh come on, guys.
Are we really having this discussion?

125
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,999
What nonsense! - Exactly.

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,479
It's such a run-of-the-mill story.

127
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,413
There was a graveyard
under every boarding school.

128
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,547
There was a hospital
under every hotel. What crap!

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,138
Can we please grow up?

130
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,009
Strange compulsion!

131
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,678
I mean, if you don't
believe in ghosts"

132
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:57,235
...it doesn't mean they don't exist.

133
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,544
I agree with Maggie.
I don't believe in ghosts.

134
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,106
Why to fear something
you haven't seen?

135
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:09,143
The day you see it,
you won't be alive to believe it.

136
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:24,912
Guys, I have a brilliant idea.

137
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:30,079
Let's go to Hotel Grandiose
for Neel's farewell.

138
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,176
To meet the ghost.

139
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,139
She will scare the ghost.

140
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,904
Really? - Really?

141
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,610
Yes! - Shall we go?

142
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,011
Come. Come. Come.

143
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:16,207
This is going to be fun.
- Get down quickly, Neel. Come on.

144
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:18,269
What are you doing?
I am trying to get down. Come on.

145
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:21,579
Maggie, help me out. - Help yourself.

146
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:24,341
Listen to me.
We are doing a very wrong thing.

147
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,943
We shouldn't lock horns with this.

148
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:31,076
What a location, guys!

149
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,939
A film's shooting should
take place here. Right?

150
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,174
Sonia is right.

151
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:38,970
This is just not scary. It's illegal.

152
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,937
What are we doing?

153
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:42,910
Having fun.

154
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,613
This one is locked.
- It's a sign. Let's just leave.

155
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,140
This is also locked.

156
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:00,843
Oh God! This place is spooky.

157
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,373
I love it.

158
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,868
This is also locked.

159
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,075
They won't leave it open.
Someone must be here.

160
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:13,337
Must be.

161
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:48,410
So it's a wrap.

162
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,309
Bad luck, guys. Come on. Let's leave.

163
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:53,277
Party is over.

164
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,378
Come on, guys.

165
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,342
Come, Maggie. - Damn!

166
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,505
Let's just crash at my place. - Yes.

167
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,174
What is this?

168
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,140
Sam. . .what happened?

169
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:26,876
You are fooling around again,
aren't you?

170
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:29,371
What is it?

171
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,235
I can hear some sound.

172
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,802
Yeah. I can hear it too.

173
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,947
It's a radio.
It's the sound of a radio.

174
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,076
Guys, if there is a radio here..

175
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:48,043
...It means someone
must be listening to it.

176
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,780
Let's do one thing.
Let's go from the backside.

177
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,004
There must be a backdoor.

178
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:54,240
Let's go try it.
Come on, baby. Come on.

179
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,143
We are not seriously doing this.
- Come on.

180
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,441
Looks like we are! - Yes!

181
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:00,137
Come on, Sam.

182
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:10,205
Let's go. Come on.

183
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:12,076
Why are we doing this?

184
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,940
Guys.

185
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:18,372
Neel, come on. Let's go. - Coming.

186
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,435
Hello. Yes, dad.

187
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,378
Yes, dad. I am fine.

188
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,105
Hello. Hello.

189
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:34,973
Dad, can you hear me? Hello.

190
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:36,171
Guys, one second please.

191
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,771
Hello. Damn!

192
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:40,742
You reach the suburbs
and the network disappears.

193
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,207
Neel, do you have network?

194
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,940
Dude, network?

195
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,379
Man, forget the phone.
Look at this place.

196
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,937
Let's go.
Come on. - What, man!

197
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:52,807
Come on.
- Come on.

198
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:53,937
Nice clock.

199
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,741
Come on, guys.
- Let's explore.

200
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:57,211
Come on, Sam.

201
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:58,746
Let's go. Let's go.

202
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:01,345
I don't want to go.
- Of course, you want to go.

203
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,643
What a location, boss!

204
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:20,771
Hello.

205
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,676
Watchman!

206
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:25,868
Is someone here?

207
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:28,038
So the sound is coming from here.

208
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,971
Come, Maggie. Okay.

209
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,047
What is this? - What do
you want to do here? Come on.

210
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,212
What an antique piece!

211
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:53,738
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

212
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,041
Welcome to Hotel Grandiose.

213
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,870
Isn't it amazing?

214
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:04,806
What's all this, Sonia? - Where?

215
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,145
Sam here!

216
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:13,934
You are mad.

217
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,004
Oh my God! - Are you crazy?
What's wrong with you?

218
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,078
Come on, Barbie doll.

219
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,773
Neel. - What do you
think you are doing here?

220
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:08,471
L...l saw myself.

221
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,980
Right, Neena.
I also saw you. - No, Neel.

222
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,646
I saw myself.

223
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,705
That's reflection, Neena.

224
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,977
I mean, it's okay to be self-obsessed.
But not to such an extent.

225
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,806
We have come here
to do something. Right?

226
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:36,473
Neel, you don't understand.
I passed from here just now.

227
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:40,138
Neena, you passed from here.

228
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,146
As I am passing from here.

229
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:46,108
And if we don't leave from
here right now, I will pass away.

230
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:48,174
Right? They are all waiting. Let's go.

231
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:51,013
Drink less tequila. Let's go.

232
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:55,475
Neena.

233
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,901
Guys.

234
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:02,409
Come on.

235
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:04,469
Neena met with her solitude.

236
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:06,374
Superb!

237
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,812
It means, Sonia and I
can go in the honeymoon suite"

238
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:10,744
...to alleviate our solitude.

239
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,802
What was the number? -3046.

240
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:15,473
3046. - Do you have a setting?
- Scoundrel.

241
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,610
3046. - Sorry.

242
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,970
Where are you?
- Yeah. I am coming. - Come. Come.

243
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,445
Careful. Don't fall. - Let's go.

244
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,806
This is the same place.
- Yes. We had to come here.

245
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:34,978
Guys, I still feel we are
making a really big mistake.

246
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:36,841
Just chill, Sonia!

247
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:41,813
Just imagine. How this place
must have been when it was functional!

248
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,835
What was that?

249
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,040
Relax, guys. It's just a can.

250
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,435
Dude.

251
00:18:58,133 --> 00:18:59,908
Go. Go home.

252
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,774
Wait.

253
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:45,614
Achint, do it again.

254
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:50,808
WTF, man!

255
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,011
Maybe it collided with a wall.

256
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:01,480
If it collides with a wall,
there will be a sound.

257
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:04,512
Suppose there is a cloth partition.

258
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,869
This is bullshit, guys. Enough.

259
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:10,578
Sam, please. Now let's just go back.
- Relax, Sonia.

260
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:13,247
It has started getting interesting.

261
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:15,510
Let's go and find out what this is.

262
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,572
I will go and see.

263
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,007
Don't be silly.
It can be dangerous. Don't do it.

264
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,505
Yes. Let's use that old idea.

265
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:28,871
I will hum a tune.

266
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:33,543
And if you stop hearing me,
come to find me.

267
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,478
Achint!

268
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,210
Achint, don't fool around.

269
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:23,273
Guys, let's go and check.
- Yeah. Come on.

270
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:25,537
Achint!

271
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:26,711
Achint!

272
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:28,441
Achint!

273
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,604
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go. - Achint!

274
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:30,577
Come on. - Come on.

275
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,237
Achint, this is not funny, man.

276
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:48,407
Achint!

277
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,903
Achint!

278
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:57,870
Achint! - Achint!

279
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:11,111
Achint!

280
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:24,803
Where is he gone?

281
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,702
Come on, Achint, that's not funny!

282
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,508
Damn!

283
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,137
Crazy. - What the hell!

284
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,170
See your faces.
Everyone is scared to death.

285
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:42,339
Oh God! - What, man?

286
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,609
Okay. I am sorry, man.

287
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:49,116
Guys, I am really, really sorry.
Forgive me.

288
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,670
I will show you
something really freaky.

289
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:53,202
Come with me.

290
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,107
Now is this cool? Or is this cool?

291
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:01,168
Check it out.

292
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:24,409
Dude, what is all this?

293
00:24:24,467 --> 00:24:25,810
Guys, you know what?

294
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:28,704
People used to say that there
used to be a mental hospital"

295
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,804
...before a hotel was built here.

296
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:33,368
They were right.

297
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:35,571
There was one.

298
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:37,444
Mental hospital?

299
00:24:38,033 --> 00:24:39,034
Like really?

300
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:42,080
But I don't know why these
insane people left their things here.

301
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,712
Come on, guys. Just leave it.

302
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,604
Whatever it was,
mental hospital, what do we care?

303
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:49,307
We have to concentrate
on our destination.

304
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:50,641
<i>Room number 3048.</i>

305
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,236
Why, doctor? Come on.

306
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:53,275
Let's go.

307
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,040
Shall we go? - Come on.

308
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:11,005
Some voice can be heard, isn't it?

309
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,011
Is it raining?

310
00:25:14,033 --> 00:25:15,341
How will it rain in the hotel?

311
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,107
I can also hear something.

312
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:20,107
Guys, there is something.
- Yes, guys. I can hear it too.

313
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:22,304
Man, let's not apply drunken logic.

314
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,680
There is some noise.
Let's go up and see.

315
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:28,011
Come. Come.

316
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,379
Oh no! Oh my God!

317
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:05,644
There is a TV here!

318
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:08,670
Hello, Ghostbusters.
Come and see your ghost.

319
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:11,573
I knew it.
It will be something like this.

320
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,046
You idiot! - You.. - Sorry. Sorry.

321
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,545
This is disturbing, man.

322
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:19,510
Why is it on? Switch it off.

323
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:22,047
Why to switch it off? Let's watch TV.

324
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,572
Right? - Hold on.

325
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,607
Guys, let's just go to
3046 and get over with this.

326
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,341
Go home and watch TV.

327
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,471
That's my girl.
- She is right. Switch it off.

328
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:32,477
Switch it off, Neel.

329
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:35,239
Hold on. - Welcome.

330
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,375
Guys, I can hear something. - Welcome.

331
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,346
Achint. - What?

332
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:50,473
Welcome.

333
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:58,008
Welcome.

334
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:02,304
Can you hear that? - Welcome.

335
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:07,504
Something. Sounds like.. -Welcome.

336
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,846
Yeah. - Welcome.

337
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:12,369
Someone is saying welcome.

338
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,438
There is no welcome.

339
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,977
You guys have had cheap liquor.
- He is right.

340
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:22,512
Let's go to 3046.

341
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:25,177
Come on.
- What is this, Sam? Let's go.

342
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:27,508
Come, my darling. 3046. - Let's go.

343
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:31,238
Did we make a mistake by coming here?

344
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:35,141
Shut up, man.

345
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:38,176
Nothing will happen. Come on.

346
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,335
3046.

347
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,247
So friends, shall we meet the ghost?

348
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:13,306
Come. Come. So finally, we are here.

349
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,481
Room 3046.

350
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:24,077
What is it? - Nothing.

351
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:29,948
What's the difference?
It's like the other rooms. Haunted!

352
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:31,969
Dude, the only difference is that"

353
00:28:32,034 --> 00:28:33,775
...a lot of people
have died in this room.

354
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,345
Including the suicide man.

355
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,044
Maggie, drink up.

356
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,013
Sorry, guys.
I am not going to leave this room.

357
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:41,375
I am also not going.

358
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,036
Drink anyone?

359
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,477
Just think, man.

360
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,303
There was a time when
this hotel was functional.

361
00:28:51,234 --> 00:28:54,238
Now imagine. A very beautiful girl..

362
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,504
...I would say a hot, sexy girl..

363
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:01,974
...would have checked
in at the reception.

364
00:29:02,267 --> 00:29:04,008
She would have come up from the lift.

365
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:06,037
Walking stylishly in the corridor"

366
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,172
"she would have reached this door.

367
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:12,007
After that, she would have gone there.

368
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:19,811
She would have come here
and closed the curtain slowly.

369
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:23,111
Why?

370
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,738
Because she wanted to take a shower.
Wow, hottie!

371
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,374
A hot girl is going to
take a shower in the hotel.

372
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,212
Ready for the shower.

373
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:33,810
She came here.

374
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:35,937
In front of this door.

375
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,077
And then she started the shower.

376
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:48,709
What the hell!

377
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:50,478
It's one hell of a coincidence!

378
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,973
You said shower.. - And the
shower started on its own accord.

379
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,040
We will have to check.

380
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,077
Sam. Sam, you are not going anywhere.

381
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:01,907
Just come back. Please, Sam.

382
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,274
Sam. Sam. - I have to see.

383
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,005
Sam. Sam, open the door, man.

384
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:52,013
Sam. - give me the torch.

385
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:54,037
Sam, open the door.

386
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,210
Sam.

387
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,142
Sam.

388
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:59,303
Sam.

389
00:31:00,267 --> 00:31:02,213
Sam, open the door. Dude.

390
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,311
Sam, open the door.

391
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:05,710
Sam. - Come on, Sam.

392
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:12,407
Oh gosh!

393
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:13,973
Sam. - Sam!

394
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:18,839
He's dead. - Guys, run. Run.

395
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:22,774
Run. - Let's go from here, guys.

396
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,403
Let's go from here. Come on.

397
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,272
Oh my God! - Let's go.

398
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,846
Guys, come back. Come back.

399
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:33,910
We can't leave Sam.

400
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:36,675
Come on. - Sam. No. No.

401
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:39,743
Hurry up, guys. - We can't go. No.

402
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,337
Come on. - We can't leave Sam.

403
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,970
Come on, guys. Fast.

404
00:31:47,034 --> 00:31:48,308
Let's go. Let's go.

405
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,141
Move. Move. Move.

406
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:54,847
Let's go. - Darn it. Darn it.

407
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,647
Come on. Move. Move.

408
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:03,912
Oh no. Oh no. - Let's go.

409
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,144
That side. That side. Go. Go.

410
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,573
Come. Come. - Run. Run. Come on.

411
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,780
Guys, this side. Go. Go.

412
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,576
No, left. That side. That side.

413
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,670
Go. Go. Go.

414
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:40,241
Where's that door?
There was a door here.

415
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,007
How it is possible?
- There was a door here.

416
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:43,842
We had entered from here.
- How is it possible?

417
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,673
Guys, we must have entered from there.

418
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,011
No. We had entered from here.

419
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,045
Don't you remember the clock?

420
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,170
Neel, you're getting confused.

421
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:51,871
There is no there.
We have to go that side.

422
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:52,941
Come on.

423
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:57,270
Guys, run. - Go. Go.

424
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:03,168
What the hell.

425
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,940
I can't believe this.

426
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,535
How is this possible?

427
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,671
How come we are back here?

428
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:10,543
Let's run.
That side. That side. - Come on.

429
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,701
Guys, this side.

430
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:22,945
Guys, that side. - Move.

431
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:29,707
Darn it. Same place.

432
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:32,573
It is a trap.

433
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,212
We are running.
But we are going nowhere.

434
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,806
Don't lose your cool.

435
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,035
Achit, that way. That way.

436
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:39,544
Go. Go. - Go. Go.

437
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:41,706
Guys, downstairs.

438
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,910
Let's go.

439
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:56,810
No. No. No. Oh no. No. -Again.

440
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:58,774
No freaking way.

441
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:02,670
We are entrapped. Darn it.

442
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,445
Oh no. No way.
I refused to be trapped like this.

443
00:34:06,567 --> 00:34:08,911
Achit. What are you doing? No, Achit.

444
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,805
Achit.

445
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,572
All of us are going to die, dude.
All of us.

446
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,007
I don't know what the
hell is happening here.

447
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,370
Yes. We shouldn't have come here.

448
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,409
Shut up, Maggi. Just shut up.

449
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,711
We came here because of you.

450
00:35:10,434 --> 00:35:11,936
Ghosts don't exist.

451
00:35:13,434 --> 00:35:14,504
What is all this?

452
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:16,813
Do you have an
explanation for all this?

453
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:18,409
Do you.

454
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,538
It better be a good one.

455
00:35:20,834 --> 00:35:24,475
Achin, I haven't forced
anyone to come here.

456
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:25,839
You are not kids.

457
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,811
Stop it, guys. Stop it.

458
00:35:29,434 --> 00:35:31,141
Sam is dead.

459
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,405
Do you know what that means?
He is dead.

460
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,912
We have lost him.
I've lost him forever.

461
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,510
<i>Guys</i>

462
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,972
...does anyone have reception?

463
00:35:58,033 --> 00:35:59,774
Please check again.

464
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,640
No.

465
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,747
But someone's phone rang
when we came to this hotel.

466
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,737
Achin, it was yours, right?

467
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,972
It was my dad.

468
00:36:16,034 --> 00:36:19,038
But as soon as we entered this hotel,
the call was disconnected.

469
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:22,844
That means there is reception
outside this hotel, right?

470
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,809
But there is no
reception in the hotel.

471
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,777
And we can't go out of the hotel.

472
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,645
But there must be network
somewhere in this hotel.

473
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:34,403
There's got to be network somewhere.

474
00:36:34,467 --> 00:36:35,468
We need to find the terrace.

475
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,041
Correct. - There must be a terrace.

476
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:41,347
He is right. There's got
to be reception on the terrace.

477
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,573
We got to get to the terrace.
We must get to the terrace.

478
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:46,813
I'll go. I'll go to the terrace.

479
00:36:47,633 --> 00:36:49,635
And Neel, stay here. Okay?

480
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:50,778
Take care of everyone.

481
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,005
Achint, don't go alone.
I'll come with you.

482
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:52,807
Wait.

483
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:57,812
Guys, be careful. - You stay there.

484
00:36:58,367 --> 00:37:00,711
And if anything, call out for help.

485
00:37:12,234 --> 00:37:13,372
Dude, terrace?

486
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:16,012
It must be here.
Let's go.

487
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,435
Watch it.

488
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:45,908
Excuse me.

489
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:52,845
Have you come to meet Mr. Kapadia?

490
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:54,443
Who is she?

491
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,777
Doctor is free now. Come.

492
00:38:58,633 --> 00:39:01,239
'We don't meet here
to scream and shout.'

493
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,843
'Tell me. Why do we meet here?'

494
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,306
'Why do we meet here?'

495
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,871
' H usha. Busha.

496
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:31,572
We all fall down.'

497
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,807
' Nlages h. '

498
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,338
Magesh, stop. Don't go any further.

499
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,800
'Husha. Busha. We all fall down.'

500
00:40:55,767 --> 00:41:01,183
'We all fall down.'

501
00:41:15,134 --> 00:41:19,480
'Ringa Ringa roses.'

502
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,310
'Ringa Ringa roses.'

503
00:41:27,267 --> 00:41:36,779
'Husha. Busha. We all fall down.'

504
00:41:58,033 --> 00:42:02,482
'Ringa Ringa roses.'

505
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:08,582
'Pocket full of roses.'

506
00:42:10,034 --> 00:42:19,045
'Husha. Busha. We all fall down.'

507
00:42:28,433 --> 00:42:30,538
Why the heck are they
taking so much time?

508
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:33,573
Why long does it take to
go to the terrace and make a call?

509
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,138
I'm going to go check on them.

510
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:38,110
But where will you look for them?

511
00:42:38,467 --> 00:42:41,038
Obviously,
they've gone to the terrace.

512
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:43,578
I guess there must
be only way to the terrace.

513
00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:47,071
If they are coming up,
I'll meet them on the way.

514
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,145
I'm going. - Wait.

515
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,205
We'll also come along.

516
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,640
Yes. Come. - Let's go.

517
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,344
Be careful. Okay?

518
00:43:04,267 --> 00:43:05,041
Achint.

519
00:43:22,634 --> 00:43:23,942
Oh my God!

520
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,235
Oh my God!

521
00:43:27,034 --> 00:43:30,038
Who is here? Who is killing us?

522
00:43:30,334 --> 00:43:33,110
Oh God! What is happening to us?

523
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:36,940
I' m sorry, Magesh.

524
00:43:38,434 --> 00:43:40,277
Achint.

525
00:43:42,067 --> 00:43:44,138
He's gone, Neel. He's gone.

526
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:47,378
Both of them. They had gone together.

527
00:43:48,234 --> 00:43:49,372
Achint is dead.

528
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:50,637
He's not dead.

529
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:53,638
I'm sure he is alive. I'll find him.

530
00:43:54,434 --> 00:43:55,412
Let's go from here.

531
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,369
Achint. Maggi, come on.

532
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,044
Achint.

533
00:44:03,334 --> 00:44:04,244
Achint.

534
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:10,077
Achint.

535
00:44:10,534 --> 00:44:11,604
Achint, where are you?

536
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,877
Achint, I can't see you. Come out.

537
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,842
Achint.

538
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:24,437
Achint.

539
00:44:24,867 --> 00:44:25,402
Achint.

540
00:44:27,234 --> 00:44:28,042
Achint.

541
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:31,879
For God's sake.

542
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,474
Where were you?

543
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,345
We thought that...

544
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,443
She'll not spare me either.

545
00:44:43,134 --> 00:44:44,340
She killed Magesh.

546
00:44:45,367 --> 00:44:46,937
She'll not spare any of us.

547
00:44:48,534 --> 00:44:50,036
She'll kill all of us.

548
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,374
Who?

549
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,237
Who is she? - Magesh is dead.

550
00:44:55,267 --> 00:44:56,837
Magesh is dead, Neel.

551
00:44:58,267 --> 00:45:00,406
I couldn't do anything for him.

552
00:45:01,534 --> 00:45:03,275
We can't do anything.

553
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:06,171
She'll kill everyone.

554
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:08,347
She'll kill all of us.

555
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,836
No one's going to die. Alright?

556
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,378
No one's going to die.

557
00:45:14,234 --> 00:45:15,907
Come on.
Come on. Let's get out of here.

558
00:45:18,767 --> 00:45:21,247
We'll survive. We'll fight this.

559
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,438
We've to...we've
to get to the terrace.

560
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,877
Okay. We have to go upstairs.

561
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:26,478
Come on. Come on.

562
00:45:27,034 --> 00:45:28,308
Let's go. Let's go, GUYS-

563
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,242
Let"s go, Achint.

564
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,438
Let's go, guys. - Come.

565
00:45:30,867 --> 00:45:31,811
Let's go, GUYS-

566
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,071
Keep moving. Guys, keep going.

567
00:45:50,867 --> 00:45:52,904
Guys, terrace. Go. Go. Go.

568
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:54,344
Come. Come. - Go. Go.

569
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:43,239
Go. Go. Go.

570
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,008
Stop. Stop. Stop guys.

571
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,271
That way. - Run.

572
00:47:01,234 --> 00:47:02,338
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

573
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,344
I can't get up.

574
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,845
Sony, what's wrong? Get up.

575
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,742
Get up, Sonia.

576
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,144
Get up, Sonia. Come on, Sonia. Get up.

577
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,237
I can't get up. I can't get up.

578
00:47:12,034 --> 00:47:13,980
Achint, help her up. Help her up.

579
00:47:15,234 --> 00:47:17,714
Sonia, get up. Get up, Sonia.

580
00:47:21,067 --> 00:47:22,876
Get up, Sonia.

581
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,777
Neena, come on.

582
00:47:46,267 --> 00:47:49,214
Neena, don't stop.
Neena, please. Come on.

583
00:47:53,734 --> 00:47:54,769
Neena.

584
00:48:01,934 --> 00:48:05,711
Guys, this hotel has been
closed since years, right?

585
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,839
Achint. Achint, this light.

586
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:11,877
If there is light, there should
be electricity somewhere, right?

587
00:48:11,967 --> 00:48:14,311
A generator creates electricity.

588
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:17,008
Right. And if there is a generator"

589
00:48:17,067 --> 00:48:19,673
...it means there is a
way in and out of here. Okay.

590
00:48:19,734 --> 00:48:21,111
There is a way to
get out of this hotel.

591
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:23,010
It means we can get out of here.

592
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,975
How? She is everywhere.

593
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:31,309
If there is only one way out,
she'll never let us reach it.

594
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,838
Both of you stay with him.

595
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,973
I'm going to look for the generator.

596
00:48:35,567 --> 00:48:36,978
You stay right here. Okay?

597
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:34,908
Guys. Guys - What happened?

598
00:49:34,967 --> 00:49:36,037
Let's go. Let's go.

599
00:49:36,234 --> 00:49:39,215
There is a jeep standing
in the parking zone downstairs.

600
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:40,979
I am sure they use to get diesel.

601
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:42,205
Let's just go. Go.

602
00:49:42,267 --> 00:49:43,610
But how are we going
to start the jeep?

603
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:44,805
Maggi, I have the keys.

604
00:49:44,867 --> 00:49:46,210
Guys, this is our last chance.
Let's go.

605
00:49:46,267 --> 00:49:49,009
Come on. Move, guys. Move. - Go. Go.

606
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,679
Where are yupu guys going?

607
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,137
Come on. Go back to your rooms.

608
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:58,209
Go. Go. Go. Let's go.

609
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,806
Hurry. Hurry.

610
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,036
Let's go. That side.

611
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:06,013
Achint. - Achint. - Neena.

612
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,542
Shruti. Go to the jeep.
Go to the jeep. Go. Go.

613
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,011
Achint, come on. Come.

614
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,872
Go. Go. Go.

615
00:50:14,234 --> 00:50:17,010
Hurry up. Open the door. - Go. Go.

616
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:19,012
Achint, hurry up. - Come on.

617
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,101
Inside. Inside.

618
00:50:20,234 --> 00:50:22,976
Neel. Neel. Come on.

619
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,938
Move it. Move it, Neel.

620
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,172
Drive. Drive.

621
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,038
Right. Right.

622
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,205
Can we make it?

623
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,738
Of course, we'll make it.

624
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:42,670
Neel, exit. Neel, exit. Exit.

625
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,977
Oh no. - Don't stop. Don't stop.

626
00:50:52,834 --> 00:50:54,711
Exit. Exit. Neel, exit.

627
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:07,478
Where are we going? - Where are we?

628
00:51:07,534 --> 00:51:08,604
Neel.

629
00:51:16,467 --> 00:51:17,673
God. Darn it.

630
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:43,114
I can't see anything. Guys.

631
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,470
I don't get it, man.

632
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,847
How can we be back to 3046?

633
00:52:24,067 --> 00:52:27,844
I don't believe this.
I just don't believe this.

634
00:52:28,367 --> 00:52:30,438
What the hell.
Somebody help us. O God.

635
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,911
This is too much. I don't get it.

636
00:52:37,967 --> 00:52:40,914
No matter where we go, we end up here.

637
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:46,375
'Pocket full of roses.'

638
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:54,877
'Husha. Busha. We all fall down.'

639
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,442
If we can survive till morning,
we'll be able to get out.

640
00:53:13,367 --> 00:53:17,076
Guys, there is not much for day break.

641
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:23,010
We can do this. Okay.

642
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,902
We have to be alive till morning.

643
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,578
At any cost.

644
00:53:27,967 --> 00:53:29,344
Did you guys notice?

645
00:53:30,534 --> 00:53:34,004
She attacks the one who is alone.

646
00:53:35,034 --> 00:53:37,708
And then kills him.

647
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:38,575
That's right.

648
00:53:39,667 --> 00:53:40,907
We should stick together.

649
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:43,743
Yes. Yes. Bang on.

650
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:45,343
Bang on.

651
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:47,410
That's exactly what we have to do.

652
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:01,574
Stay together. Just stay together.

653
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,470
All of us will stay here now.
In this room. Together.

654
00:54:07,967 --> 00:54:08,707
Yes.

655
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,643
Come what may.
We'll not step out of here.

656
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,236
.Maggi.'

657
00:54:21,834 --> 00:54:23,313
.Maggi.'

658
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:30,271
.Maggi.'

659
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,936
She is calling me.

660
00:54:34,234 --> 00:54:36,646
Calm down. Calm down. Ignore. Ignore.

661
00:54:37,234 --> 00:54:38,736
We have to stick together. Okay?

662
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,271
We won't go anywhere. Sit. Sit.

663
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,879
We've to stick together. Remember?

664
00:54:42,934 --> 00:54:43,742
Sit. Sit.

665
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,337
'Maggi. Someone help me.'

666
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,744
Darn it. That's Sonia's voice.

667
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,245
But how is this possible?

668
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:50,937
She is...

669
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,943
You guys don't get it.

670
00:54:53,234 --> 00:54:54,269
That is not Sonia.

671
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,343
This is her. Don't listen to her.

672
00:54:56,467 --> 00:55:00,347
'Maggi. Neena. Where are you?'

673
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,413
Guys, this is Sonia.

674
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:08,482
Maggi, this is not Sonia.
Don't open the door. Trust me.

675
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,441
I know it's not her.

676
00:55:11,467 --> 00:55:12,605
.Maggi.'

677
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:16,343
Calm down. Why don't you get it?

678
00:55:17,233 --> 00:55:21,409
This is not her.
She wants one of us to step out.

679
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:24,605
And she...For God's sake, ignore her.

680
00:55:24,733 --> 00:55:25,768
Ignore her. Right?

681
00:55:25,834 --> 00:55:26,574
Calm down.

682
00:55:26,633 --> 00:55:28,203
But what if this is Sonia?

683
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,208
She'll kill her if we don't go out.

684
00:55:32,767 --> 00:55:33,939
I have to go out.

685
00:55:34,634 --> 00:55:35,510
Open the door.

686
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,405
This is not Sonia, Neena.
Please listen to me.

687
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:39,241
Please.

688
00:55:40,234 --> 00:55:41,235
He is right.

689
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,779
No one's going out. Understand?

690
00:55:43,834 --> 00:55:44,904
But Neel...

691
00:55:46,734 --> 00:55:50,409
Guys...help me. Help

692
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:52,612
Don't be selfish. I am going.

693
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:54,508
Stop her. Stop her please.

694
00:55:57,467 --> 00:56:01,643
If we go out, we'll go together.

695
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,770
Have you gone mad?

696
00:56:03,834 --> 00:56:05,575
Achint.

697
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,443
Neel.

698
00:56:28,634 --> 00:56:29,772
This is not right.

699
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,372
It's a very bad idea, Neel.

700
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,501
Start. Darn it.

701
00:57:00,367 --> 00:57:01,209
Guys.

702
00:57:04,267 --> 00:57:05,541
Maggi.

703
00:57:09,267 --> 00:57:10,177
Wait. Wait.

704
00:57:11,234 --> 00:57:12,076
Listen.

705
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,242
How do we believe that you are Sonia?

706
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:17,504
What do you mean?

707
00:57:18,233 --> 00:57:19,678
What's that supposed to mean?

708
00:57:33,133 --> 00:57:34,476
Are you okay? - No.

709
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:45,706
Neel, the name of the girl..

710
00:57:47,734 --> 00:57:50,237
...who is killing all of us is Maya.

711
00:58:12,734 --> 00:58:14,304
She was mentally sick.

712
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,341
She was mentally unstable.

713
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,404
Magesh was right. It was not a rumour.

714
00:58:20,733 --> 00:58:22,644
There used to be a mental asylum here.

715
00:58:26,467 --> 00:58:28,344
This was perhaps the manager's room.

716
00:58:29,467 --> 00:58:32,209
I found this file in
one of the drawers here.

717
00:58:36,267 --> 00:58:39,009
She murdered her entire family.

718
00:58:40,367 --> 00:58:41,675
It was a family of seven.

719
00:58:43,067 --> 00:58:45,013
When she was produced in the court.

720
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:47,547
...she said that she
had married the satan.

721
00:58:47,967 --> 00:58:50,345
And she murdered so many
people at the behest of the satan.

722
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,473
'The court, for mental rehabilitation
sends her to state...'

723
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:02,339
The doctor who has treating her,
she killed him as well..

724
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,943
...during a psychiatric session.

725
00:59:05,434 --> 00:59:08,904
The doctors and nurses of the hospital
were scared of going close to her.

726
00:59:09,467 --> 00:59:12,641
And 18 people died due to
a short circuit in the hospital"

727
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,902
"after a few days.

728
00:59:15,167 --> 00:59:18,341
A case was filed.
And the hospital was closed down.

729
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:21,539
The hospital was closed for years.

730
00:59:22,367 --> 00:59:25,143
And a really big hotelier
bought this place"

731
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,202
...to build a hotel.

732
00:59:27,933 --> 00:59:29,469
He built the hotel alright.

733
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:31,636
But accidents happened regularly.

734
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:36,638
And the hotel was also
shut down after a few days.

735
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,539
And then Vikrant Nirula
committed suicide"

736
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,580
...by jumping off the roof.

737
00:59:49,434 --> 00:59:51,380
This is so freaking crazy.

738
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,904
Do you think Maya brought
Sonia to this room on purpose?

739
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,538
So that we could read all this.

740
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,113
I feel that Maya
is stuck in these walls.

741
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,504
And she wants to tell us something.

742
01:00:05,634 --> 01:00:07,341
She is trying to communicate.

743
01:00:09,334 --> 01:00:11,280
So what do you suggest?

744
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:29,271
Maya.

745
01:00:31,467 --> 01:00:32,639
Maya.

746
01:00:34,067 --> 01:00:36,604
Maya, we know your story.

747
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,376
I am trying to reach out to you, Maya.

748
01:00:44,034 --> 01:00:45,411
Speak to us.

749
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,602
What do you want from us, Maya?

750
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,137
What do you want from us?

751
01:02:00,233 --> 01:02:01,075
What happened?

752
01:02:03,034 --> 01:02:04,035
What happened?

753
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:09,370
She"

754
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:10,802
She said that"

755
01:02:12,767 --> 01:02:14,178
She said that"

756
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,941
She said that she
only wants to kill us.

757
01:02:20,034 --> 01:02:21,240
She doesn't want anything else.

758
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,336
She just wants to kill us.

759
01:02:25,134 --> 01:02:26,238
I had told you.

760
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:29,174
Didn't I tell you?
She wouldn't spare us.

761
01:02:29,767 --> 01:02:32,771
She will not spare any of us.
No. - What are we going to do now?

762
01:02:33,234 --> 01:02:34,178
What are we going to do now?

763
01:02:35,034 --> 01:02:40,313
We shouldn't have come here.
We are going to die. - No. No.

764
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:43,037
We will survive, okay?

765
01:02:43,867 --> 01:02:44,868
We just need to..

766
01:02:45,233 --> 01:02:47,110
We just have to hide.

767
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:53,980
Keep moving. Keep moving.

768
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,474
Guys. Get in.
Get in. Quick, quick, quick.

769
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:07,978
Lock the door. Lock the door.

770
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,138
Lock the door.

771
01:03:10,367 --> 01:03:11,141
Achint. - Yes.

772
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:11,940
Block it. Block it.

773
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,345
Crap. Crap.

774
01:03:17,834 --> 01:03:18,835
Everyone, switch on your phones.

775
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,810
Yes. - Yes.

776
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,344
Can we see anything?

777
01:03:21,967 --> 01:03:23,037
Guys. - Yes.

778
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,711
Let us just stick together.

779
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:26,939
Everybody hold hands. - Yes.

780
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,172
Yes. - Everyone, give me your hands.

781
01:03:36,033 --> 01:03:37,341
Sonia. - Yes.

782
01:03:38,067 --> 01:03:41,071
Keep your eyes and ears open. Okay?

783
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,903
Yes. The night will be
over in some time soon. Okay?

784
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,976
We will make it.
We will make it, okay? - Yes.

785
01:03:48,034 --> 01:03:51,846
Don't believe in any other
thing or situation. Okay? - Yes.

786
01:03:52,433 --> 01:03:54,242
It is just us. - Yes.

787
01:03:54,767 --> 01:03:56,713
Okay? Just the four of us. Alright?

788
01:03:56,734 --> 01:03:58,304
Yes. - There is nobody else.

789
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,673
We are going to survive.

790
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:04,075
We are going to survive.

791
01:04:14,633 --> 01:04:17,671
Oh my God! - Oh no!

792
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:19,310
Oh my God!

793
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:22,007
Oh my God! Oh God.

794
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,646
Man, she is coming towards us.
She is coming.

795
01:04:24,667 --> 01:04:26,203
Crap. Crap! Crap!

796
01:04:26,267 --> 01:04:27,974
Oh no. - Don't leave your hands, okay?
- Yes. Okay.

797
01:04:28,034 --> 01:04:29,206
Don't leave your hands, guys.

798
01:04:29,267 --> 01:04:31,304
Don't panic. - Don't give up.
Don't move. Don't move.

799
01:04:33,267 --> 01:04:34,371
Calm down, Sonia.

800
01:04:34,834 --> 01:04:38,646
Sonia, calm down.
Guys, she is trying to scare us.

801
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:41,405
She wants us to go apart.
But we wouldn't get scared.

802
01:04:41,634 --> 01:04:42,635
Calm down.

803
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:44,112
She is coming here.. - Calm down.

804
01:04:44,167 --> 01:04:45,077
We are all going to die.

805
01:04:46,067 --> 01:04:48,638
No, Sonia, you won't die.
Please understand. - Crap.

806
01:04:50,334 --> 01:04:52,644
Calm down. - Shut up, Sonia. Shut up.

807
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,875
Give me your hands. Relax.

808
01:04:55,134 --> 01:04:56,636
We will make it,
guys, we will make it.

809
01:04:57,567 --> 01:04:59,240
We will all sit together.
Okay? No one must go apart.

810
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:02,010
Crap. This smoke
is going on increasing.

811
01:05:02,067 --> 01:05:02,875
Crap!

812
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:05,310
Guys, all of you are okay, right?

813
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:07,702
You guys are alright?
Yes? I am going to..

814
01:05:07,767 --> 01:05:09,610
I am going to call out your names.
One by one.

815
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,178
Just reply to me. Okay.

816
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,073
Maggie. Maggie, okay?

817
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,579
Yes. - Alright.
Alright, it is alright.

818
01:05:18,767 --> 01:05:19,575
Anchit.

819
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,806
Yes. - Yes. Yes, I am here.

820
01:05:20,867 --> 01:05:21,845
Alright

821
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:22,910
Leena. - Yes.

822
01:05:22,967 --> 01:05:24,742
Leena. - Yes, yes, I am here.

823
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,143
Alright. Sonia.

824
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,142
Sonia?

825
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,670
Sonia. - Sonia,
why are you not saying anything?

826
01:05:35,267 --> 01:05:38,271
Sonia, for God's sake, just say yes.
You are there.

827
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:41,173
Yes. I am there.

828
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,537
Go. Go. Go.

829
01:05:58,067 --> 01:05:59,637
Go. Go. Go.

830
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,802
Come on.

831
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:19,208
Oh my God.

832
01:06:19,867 --> 01:06:21,073
Soniya.

833
01:06:48,634 --> 01:06:49,772
So this is it.

834
01:06:52,167 --> 01:06:53,805
We are all going to die.

835
01:06:57,934 --> 01:07:01,541
Guys. This is it.

836
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,679
We are all going to die.

837
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:07,205
This"

838
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,706
We are all going to die..

839
01:07:12,133 --> 01:07:13,942
Did you ever think that
this is going to happen with us?

840
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,441
Our guesses were wrong.

841
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,136
She wants nothing from us.

842
01:07:20,834 --> 01:07:21,676
But death.

843
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,071
Even if we stay together,
it wouldn't be of any use.

844
01:07:27,734 --> 01:07:28,940
We have to survive.

845
01:07:29,734 --> 01:07:30,940
We have to survive.

846
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,913
There is very less
time left for morning.

847
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,570
Neel. What is the time?

848
01:07:37,534 --> 01:07:38,877
It is five minutes to four.

849
01:07:41,834 --> 01:07:42,710
One minute.

850
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:44,141
What time did you say?

851
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,709
I said it is five minutes to four.

852
01:07:46,967 --> 01:07:47,877
Okay?

853
01:07:48,834 --> 01:07:52,213
Neel, do you remember the time I
met you near the shop at the corridor.

854
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,738
It is very strange.

855
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,407
And maybe this doesn't
even have any logic.

856
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:03,748
But at that time, every clock in the
shop was showing five minutes to four.

857
01:08:04,434 --> 01:08:06,914
And it is the same time now.
It is five minutes to four.

858
01:08:07,467 --> 01:08:09,378
That is so strange, Leena.

859
01:08:09,634 --> 01:08:11,079
And this is not a mere
misconception of mine.

860
01:08:11,467 --> 01:08:12,411
Neel is the proof.

861
01:08:13,034 --> 01:08:14,707
Do you think this has a meaning?

862
01:08:14,767 --> 01:08:15,370
Maybe.

863
01:08:16,434 --> 01:08:18,072
Guys, like déjé vu.

864
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,039
When we see something and feel
that we have seen it before as well.

865
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:21,901
Right?

866
01:08:23,367 --> 01:08:25,904
And premonition and
intuition are the same.

867
01:08:26,767 --> 01:08:28,110
When we can see the
impending things early.

868
01:08:28,367 --> 01:08:29,778
You know, like a proper visual.

869
01:08:30,134 --> 01:08:30,908
Yes?

870
01:08:32,367 --> 01:08:33,437
I don't believe it.

871
01:08:34,367 --> 01:08:35,368
Is this possible?

872
01:08:35,434 --> 01:08:37,380
We will come to know
of it when we go there.

873
01:08:38,034 --> 01:08:40,844
Guys, we can be saved.
We can be saved.

874
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:42,138
Come on, let us go.

875
01:08:58,800 --> 01:08:59,835
I was standing here.

876
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,006
I was right here.

877
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,504
Occult.

878
01:09:21,034 --> 01:09:23,605
It is written here that every spirit"

879
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:26,011
...is connected with
something or human being.

880
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,504
And every evil spirit
derives it strength"

881
01:09:30,567 --> 01:09:32,706
...from the thing it is attached to.

882
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,345
So assume that Maya gets
all her strength from a source.

883
01:09:38,734 --> 01:09:41,442
How would we know
that what that thing is?

884
01:09:41,734 --> 01:09:43,645
We can come to know of it.
It is written here.

885
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,608
What is written there?

886
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,004
There is a chant written here.

887
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,071
We have to hold each
other's hand and repeat it.

888
01:09:52,934 --> 01:09:56,404
<i>Mfirato Spiritus.</i>

889
01:09:57,767 --> 01:10:02,079
Concigarato unmelitus. - Unmelitus.

890
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:05,972
<i>Mfirato Spiritus.</i>

891
01:10:06,434 --> 01:10:08,607

Maya. MaYa-

921
01:11:27,001 --> 01:11:31,381
If you don't listen to us, I hope you
know what we are going to do to you.

922
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,471
Maya listen to us.

923
01:11:51,434 --> 01:11:53,345
Maya. Kishan.

924
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,240
Mother. Teena.

925
01:11:55,601 --> 01:11:58,207
Get hold of her.
Come on. Don't leave her. Come on.

926
01:14:15,101 --> 01:14:15,602
So- -

927
01:14:18,501 --> 01:14:20,242
All the powers are in this machine.

928
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,605
When she was being
given shock treatment"

929
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:28,213
...she used all her powers to make
the flow of the process go backwards.

930
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:37,150
And since then,
all her powers are in this machine.

931
01:14:39,134 --> 01:14:42,638
Meaning if we burn this
machine in fir, maybe..

932
01:14:43,501 --> 01:14:46,311
Maybe we can get saved from all this.

933
01:14:46,367 --> 01:14:48,108
But how?

934
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,070
But how are we going to burn it?

935
01:14:50,101 --> 01:14:51,273
There must be something
in the kitchen, right?

936
01:14:51,767 --> 01:14:53,440
Kerosene. Petrol. Anything.

937
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,204
Yes.

938
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,510
We got to act smart on this one, okay?

939
01:15:00,567 --> 01:15:03,377
Maya will not let us take the
machine out of here in any situation.

940
01:15:04,234 --> 01:15:05,440
So we got to do something.

941
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,648
Guys. There are four of us.
We got to split us.

942
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:13,309
Two of us will remain here.
And two people will go to the kitchen.

943
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,510
Let us find something
to burn this thing down. Right?

944
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,535
That side common.

945
01:15:26,167 --> 01:15:27,271
Quickly - yes

946
01:15:30,001 --> 01:15:31,139
Maggie. - Yes.

947
01:15:31,667 --> 01:15:33,305
We got to split up.
Okay? - Yes, yes.

948
01:15:34,167 --> 01:15:35,612
Go and find that side.
I will find this side.

949
01:15:35,667 --> 01:15:36,702
Just stay on my side. Alright?

950
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:38,275
Yes. Okay.

951
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,980
Maggie. Don't go too far. Okay?

952
01:15:52,734 --> 01:15:54,577
Breaking news.

953
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:59,243
Last night,
seven friends in a drunken state"

954
01:15:59,334 --> 01:16:01,541
"went inside the hotel.

955
01:16:03,067 --> 01:16:04,671
They did go inside.

956
01:16:05,034 --> 01:16:08,208
But they couldn't go outside.

957
01:16:09,467 --> 01:16:14,416
I have heard that the hotel is under
the control of a witch called Maya.

958
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:20,906
Nagen, Soniya and Maggie.

959
01:16:23,134 --> 01:16:26,911
Maggie was in the kitchen
when she saw someone..

960
01:16:26,934 --> 01:16:29,972
...reading the newspaper on a chair.

961
01:16:31,567 --> 01:16:34,275
She was going towards her when..

962
01:16:35,334 --> 01:16:36,312
Maggie.

963
01:16:37,234 --> 01:16:38,235
What happened

964
01:16:40,934 --> 01:16:44,006
There was something there. - Where?

965
01:16:44,201 --> 01:16:45,236
There paper. .

966
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,238
There is nothing there, Maggie. - No.

967
01:16:50,267 --> 01:16:52,508
Anyways, we didn't get anything here.

968
01:16:53,167 --> 01:16:54,145
We better go look somewhere else.
Come on.

969
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,508
Come on. Let us go.

970
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,845
Maggie, let us go.

971
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:10,869
Maggie.

972
01:17:13,267 --> 01:17:14,211
Maggie.

973
01:17:59,867 --> 01:18:00,868
Maggie.

974
01:18:02,301 --> 01:18:03,177
Maggie.

975
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:04,779
Maggie, where are you?

976
01:18:09,334 --> 01:18:10,972
Maggie. Where are you?

977
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,808
Maggie, where are you?

978
01:18:24,234 --> 01:18:27,272

979
01:18:31,767 --> 01:18:32,768

No, no, we cannot fall weak now,
alright?

1007
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:54,076
