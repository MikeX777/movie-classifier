{\an8}SAN NICOLA AL MONTE, ITALY
1,486 METERS -2°C,

2
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:24,083
{\an8}DECEMBER 21ST

3
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,625
You're dead.

4
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,500
You're dead! Dead!

5
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,625
Dead!

6
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,333
Mom, can't you wake me up by
shouting, like all normal moms?

7
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:56,250
I've killed all normal moms.

8
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,416
Take that! And that!

9
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,625
Do you think Dad
will be back for Christmas?

10
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,791
Haven't you heard?
His helicopter was downed by a shark.

11
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,708
Come on, can't you be serious for once?

12
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,958
- We're real crazy, aren't we?
- Maybe a little too much.

13
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,208
Elia, don't talk about yourself that way.

14
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,166
I wasn't talking about myself.

15
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh, thanks.

16
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:30,791
You're lucky I'm late
or I'd have tickled you to death.

17
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,708
I'm running to the store.

18
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,125
Why? Have we finally had a customer?

19
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,958
It's not my fault
if people don't play anymore

20
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,291
with good old-fashioned toys.

21
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,625
Anyhow, I like the marionette.

22
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,083
Enjoy your day, sweetie.
And remember...

23
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,791
Never stop dreaming,
even when you're awake.

24
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,458
Good boy.

25
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,833
Say, "Bye!"

26
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,750
- Bye.
- Bye!

27
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:08,333
{\an8}SANTA'S WORKSHOP, NORTH POLE
2,147 METERS -49°C

28
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,583
{\an8}<i>Cheer up, my friends!
Only a few days to Christmas.</i>

29
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,916
{\an8}A storm of gifts has been forecast
by the weather service

30
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,208
{\an8}for all good children.
None for the naughty ones, of course.

31
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,833
{\an8}<i>We remind you it's strictly forbidden
to interact with children.</i>

32
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,083
<i>But keep up the Christmas magic.</i>

33
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,708
{\an8}I won't fail. He loves huge pencils.

34
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,750
{\an8}I hope I'm not too late.

35
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,125
{\an8}<i>Public service announcement.</i>

36
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:42,458
{\an8}<i>Whoever has been using the glitter-gun
must clean it before putting it back.</i>

37
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,250
{\an8}Calm down, be quiet!

38
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,958
{\an8}I will call you. Take a number.

39
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,666
{\an8}Talking about toys, today is the last day

40
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,666
{\an8}to present your latest inventions.

41
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:57,083
{\an8}Will Trip be kicked out of
the boss' office again this year?

42
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,375
{\an8}Or will they stop him
before he sets foot inside?

43
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,041
{\an8}- Nine!
- Here it is!

44
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,541
{\an8}Come.

45
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,291
{\an8}<i>Whoever has had their prototype approved,</i>

46
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,416
{\an8}<i>please approach the assembly area
for a test.</i>

47
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,875
Highest Royalty, may I?

48
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,625
Naughty kids...

49
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,208
are on the rise.

50
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,416
Are you there, Your Toyness?

51
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:29,708
Who's there?

52
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,125
Dear old Trip!

53
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,791
What have you brought me this year?

54
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,000
Have you made me any new toys?

55
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,625
Yes, I'm a bit nervous, though,
nearly moved,

56
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,458
because this time I've outdone myself.

57
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,958
I made this.
It's called Multi-Sound Whistle.

58
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, cute!

59
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,333
What are you doing here, Trip?

60
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,875
I gave you ticket number 60,
and they just called number nine.

61
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,083
How is that possible?

62
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:21,791
Trip.

63
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,250
Your Playfulness,
his behavior is jeopardizing

64
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,000
the elven kinship
which has characterized us for millennia.

65
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:33,916
Idiot!

66
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,791
Your Toyness, this whistle can emit

67
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,250
any sound you want to hear.

68
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,250
Children will love it!

69
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,375
Let me hear the sound of kittens,
you know I like those.

70
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,041
Yes. This works the other way around.
You have to suck in.

71
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,125
And now give me a horror movie scream.
Come on!

72
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:13,833
For goodness sake.

73
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,708
Now I'd like the shoelace
of a man's shoe from the '50s

74
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,875
rubbing against a gramophone.

75
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,500
I love gramophones.

76
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,208
But... Trip! But...

77
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:43,958
Well done.

78
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,916
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

79
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,583
Last, but not least,
my latest invention.

80
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,833
Perhaps my greatest masterpiece.

81
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,083
Well! Let's see.

82
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,125
This one.

83
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,750
This is the spinn...

84
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,083
The spinn...

85
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,708
The spinn...

86
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,208
- Spinning topper.
- Yes.

87
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,791
It basically works like a spinn...
A spinn...

88
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,541
- A spinning top.
- Thanks.

89
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,541
But it's not the top
that spins, it's...

90
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,708
the room!

91
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,500
The whole room spins around.

92
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,250
Yes. The whole room is spinning around.

93
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,166
But then you know
how to turn it off, right?

94
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,958
Well, I'm working on that!

95
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,958
How do we stop it?

96
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,208
Trip!

97
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,416
Now stop it!

98
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,500
Trip!

99
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,333
Stop it right now, Trip!

100
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,125
How?

101
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,833
Stop it!

102
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,833
I'm sorry!

103
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:01,500
Trip. I'll kill you!

104
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,791
Next up!

105
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,625
These contraptions'll be kept here...

106
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,625
REJECTED PROTOTYPES STORAGE

107
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,666
...along with those from past years.

108
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,375
Your inventions are dangerous.

109
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,666
Crazy.

110
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:18,166
But my toys give kids
the thrill they seek.

111
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,833
What do you know about what kids seek?
Have you ever seen one?

112
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,333
What do you know about them?
Studied them in handbooks?

113
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,916
Like they were home appliances.

114
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,250
Well, unlike you, though,

115
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,875
I am still... still a crafter elf!

116
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,916
You miserable loser!

117
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:49,666
I was out of line.

118
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,875
Trip, I know they are looking for
a new football stitcher. Sorry.

119
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,208
Come on, you're taking ages! Hurry up.

120
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,166
- Give it back!
- Come on, let me open it.

121
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,500
I want to open it myself.

122
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,500
Hands off!

123
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,916
- Are you ready?
- Go for it.

124
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,041
<i>Wünderkammer's</i> sacred hammer.

125
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,041
Got it.

126
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,541
The Son of Troll!

127
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,041
But it's a half-blood's card!

128
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,250
The Crafter Elf!

129
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,166
With the power to forge magical artifacts?

130
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,583
I don't have it.

131
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,916
Come on, read his skills!

132
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,833
Come on!

133
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,958
Hi, losers.

134
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,208
Hi, Giada.

135
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,208
Is that a Buddy Buddy?
How did you get it?

136
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,958
Who told you that you can talk to me?

137
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,500
I gave it to her.
My dad is the only one who can sell them.

138
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,375
Unlike that loser mom of yours,
who only sells trash.

139
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,625
What are you hiding there? Show me.

140
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,791
Run!

141
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,291
Chicken shits!

142
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,875
Let's go get our bikes.

143
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,708
Come on, they're running away!

144
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,541
Come on! Come on!

145
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,125
Come on, faster!

146
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,916
When will you learn how to ride a bike?

147
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,541
Leave me here. Save yourself.

148
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,458
No! We can make it!

149
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,916
If I catch you, I'll kill you!

150
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,000
They're getting too close.

151
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,583
We can make it, trust me!

152
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,000
Ouch!

153
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,125
- Give it back!
- Why?

154
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,958
What if I don't?

155
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,708
Come on, come at me.

156
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,625
Do you want it back?

157
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,166
Come to the sled race tomorrow.
At the Devil's Leap.

158
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,333
If you don't die, it'll be yours.

159
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,625
But you don't have the guts, anyway.

160
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,208
Dummy.

161
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,416
Come on, let's get out of here.

162
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,083
Forget him. That half-blood.

163
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,666
Son of a troll.

164
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,333
These good antique toys are nice,
aren't they?

165
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,125
A bit too old-fashioned, though.

166
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,583
I bet even Elia is giving you a headache
with Buddy Buddy.

167
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,500
If I were given a penny
every time someone asks me for one,

168
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,916
I'd be rich by now.

169
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,458
You said the magic word, dear.

170
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,583
"Rich."

171
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,125
Hi, Ivana. How are you?

172
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,250
I managed to get
a whole container of them.

173
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:11,291
Even San Nicola al Monte
will become the center of the world.

174
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,333
Ciocca, please put this thing away.

175
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,750
But Ivana! Don't you want me?

176
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,375
No, I don't! I'd rather go bankrupt.

177
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,166
Every Christmas is the same old story.

178
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,291
Everyone goes crazy
for the toy of the moment

179
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,708
and the next day... Poof!
They forget all about it.

180
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,083
God forbid...

181
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,708
You're right, Ivana, but the public
makes the demand.

182
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,625
Whatever.

183
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,875
We're here to give the public
what they want, right?

184
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,916
Tell me...
How many would you like to order?

185
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,708
One hundred, 200? Come on.

186
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,750
Ivana,

187
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,291
I know you're having a hard time here.

188
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:50,666
And now that your husband has gone,
well...

189
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,333
it must be hard.

190
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,375
And it will be even harder

191
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,583
when all the other shops sell my stuff.

192
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,625
I'm saying this for your good, Ivana.

193
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,041
You don't give a damn about me,

194
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,083
about Christmas, about toys,
and not even about kids!

195
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,541
Last year you sold
counterfeited washing machines

196
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,208
and Luigino went belly-up.
And what about Rosa, the baker?

197
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,666
She went bankrupt
when you started making that thing...

198
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,833
The lab-grown, gluten-free wheat.
You're a shark.

199
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:22,916
A bad shark.

200
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,916
You're breaking my heart, Ivana.

201
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,375
I'm just a down-to-earth businessman
who knows how the world works.

202
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,625
Mom, let's go. I'm hungry!

203
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,000
Yes, darling, let's go.

204
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,291
Ciocca, put everything away and go.

205
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,416
Ivana...

206
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,041
If you say no now, you're out.

207
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,416
Do you realize what you're missing out on?

208
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,166
Get out of my shop!

209
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,125
Hi, Elia. Do you want to play with me?

210
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,000
Look at the effect it has on kids.

211
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,500
Go away, you and all this junk!
Come on! Out!

212
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,000
This shop will go bankrupt!

213
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,708
Back at you!

214
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,375
This shop will go bankrupt.

215
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,958
I know what children like.

216
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:26,750
REJECTED PROTOTYPES
SECTOR B

217
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,291
Kids like stuffed animals and wrestling.

218
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,708
The wrestling teddy bear.

219
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,958
They even rejected you.

220
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,625
Why did you turn Ciocca down?

221
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,041
Because I know what kids want.

222
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,416
Are you sure?

223
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,208
I'm a kid and I know what I want.

224
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,333
Yeah? And what is that?

225
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,000
A Buddy Buddy, for example.

226
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,541
And why do you want it?

227
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,625
Because it's super cool, brand new
and everybody wants it.

228
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,833
Put Dino away.

229
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,708
Do you think it's right that something is
only cool because everybody wants one?

230
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,208
Old things give me the blues.

231
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,166
I actually love them. They give me joy.

232
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,333
Have you heard from Dad?

233
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,083
Grab your watch,
let's play telling the time.

234
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,791
Remember, the short hand is hours

235
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,291
and the long one is minutes.

236
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,083
So, what time is it?

237
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,625
It's...

238
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,208
- Ten.
- Okay.

239
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,250
And 45. It's 10:45.

240
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,291
Yes!

241
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,250
Good!

242
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,958
Perfect, good job.

243
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,708
But now we also know that it's late.

244
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,708
Go on, get under the sheets,

245
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,333
it'll be Christmas soon.

246
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,458
So, now close your eyes and dream big,

247
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:15,416
very big about all
your heart's desires. All right?

248
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,416
- Good night.
- Good night.

249
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,791
The Present Blaster!

250
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,125
The amount of time
this would have saved Santa...

251
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,125
"But Trip is incompetent!

252
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,125
"Trip only invents useless things.

253
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,500
"Trip... Trip is crazy.

254
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,708
"Trip's inventions are dangerous!"

255
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,791
This Christmas will be different, though.
Trip is taking care of it.

256
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,833
Ow! Ouch! It hurts!
Don't hit me on the head!

257
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,833
I don't have much time,
so I'll make it short.

258
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,291
I don't have much time,
so I'll make it sho...

259
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:34,083
Look, midget, I don't have much time,
so I'll make it short.

260
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,208
My name is Trip.

261
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:38,916
I'm from Santa's village
and I'm a crafter elf.

262
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,000
Is this one of Vittorio's pranks?

263
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,875
Untie me and we'll see who is stronger.

264
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,416
Are you craz...

265
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,833
Testing, one, two, three. Are you crazy?

266
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,666
- Hel...
- Shut up!

267
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,958
Why are you screaming? Stop that!

268
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,791
If you don't scream,
I'll give you a gift. Okay?

269
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,875
Got it? Promise? You won't scream?

270
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,041
Don't scream!

271
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:03,625
- Hel...
- Shut up!

272
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:05,041
You won't scream? Wait there.

273
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:08,875
Let's see, let's see...

274
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,375
Here it is. What's its name?

275
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,208
Yes, we make this, too, in the North Pole.
We use reindeer snot.

276
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,291
This is basic. This is the basic version,
yes, yes.

277
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,625
All right, then. I'll make a few changes.

278
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,125
Let me introduce you
to the toy-tidying slime.

279
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,875
Nice, isn't it?

280
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,375
It wasn't received very well in the Pole.
No, it wasn't. They're damn jealous.

281
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,875
Still, they think highly of me.

282
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,958
This slime can tidy up all your toys.

283
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:56,041
You can make all the mess you want,
and it'll take care of everything.

284
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,791
Like a mom, but without the scolding.

285
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,250
Let me show you.

286
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,833
It looks like something
from an old horror movie.

287
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,250
It can't be safe, right?

288
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:11,250
Of course it is.
Sure, just don't feed it a dog,

289
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:14,791
a cat or a kid, or it will explode.

290
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:25,375
So much for tidying them up!
That thing is eating all my toys!

291
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:27,583
- Oops.
- Don't "oops" me.

292
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:28,708
Make it stop!

293
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,791
Wait, it's not that easy.

294
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:33,416
It has a mind of its own.

295
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:38,000
It's a living thing, you know,
so it's a bit complicated,

296
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,458
but I've got an idea.

297
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,166
I'm handling it. I'm handling it.

298
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,958
There, got it.
I'll handle this, don't you worry!

299
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,291
I'm taming it! Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

300
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,541
I'll show you!

301
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:09,625
See? I've pretty much knocked it out.

302
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,958
Okay! Now I got you, okay!

303
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:23,916
There.

304
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,166
Done. Hopefully it won't clog the pipes.

305
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:29,666
Done. Here we go.

306
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,291
- So, kiddo...
- Elia.

307
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,416
- Elia the kid.
- Get out of my house.

308
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,166
I wish I could,

309
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:40,791
but without your return-letter,
I'll be stuck here with you.

310
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,041
Got it?

311
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,833
You're a crafter elf, aren't you?
Think of something.

312
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:47,416
I came as a present

313
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,750
and an unwanted present can be sent back

314
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:52,083
only by writing a return-letter to Santa,

315
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,541
written by the kid who received
the present, okay?

316
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:56,375
But I asked for a badass sled.

317
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:59,125
Look, I know how
North Pole red tape works, all right?

318
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:01,083
I need to be back by Christmas,
or else...

319
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,041
- You'll be grounded?
- Ground me?

320
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:06,500
Listen to him, ground me. I'll die, croak,
kick the bucket.

321
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:09,458
- Aren't you overreacting?
- Does it look like it?

322
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:12,916
Who said if you're not back in the
North Pole by Christmas you'll croak?

323
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:14,666
The Christmas Spirit.

324
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:16,375
- Like in <i>A Christmas Carol?</i>
- No,

325
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,458
those are Christmas spirits.
The Christmas Spirit permeates everything.

326
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:23,000
But here on Earth it only appears
at this time of the year,

327
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,583
and then it vanishes on Christmas morning

328
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:27,875
between the exchange of gifts
and the family lunch,

329
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:31,625
where the colorful magic of anticipation
is replaced

330
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,291
by the bitter realization that that day

331
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:37,583
will be a Christmas day like any other.

332
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,458
- So, you'll die?
- What did I say?

333
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:41,541
Write that letter for me, please.

334
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,083
DEAR SANTA

335
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:48,916
Aren't you gonna write?

336
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,083
A case of writer's block?

337
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:58,125
Listen to the dumb elf.
I must get back to the Pole,

338
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:00,583
I'm setting up a sort of revolution.

339
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:03,583
Will you shut up a minute?
I have to focus.

340
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:06,375
Let me know if I can help
speed up the paperwork.

341
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,791
I'm an elf and I don't have fingerprints,
so I can't go to jail.

342
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:12,000
- How about that?
- Enough of this!

343
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:15,041
- I'm fed up!
- Where you going? What you doing?

344
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:16,583
Is it too hot in here?

345
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:21,791
- You can write your own letter.
- How...

346
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:23,375
Tomorrow I'm racing Vittorio

347
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,041
and with that sled,
I'm lucky if I don't get myself killed!

348
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:28,083
I'll fix it. I'm a master at sled-making!

349
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:30,791
- Get out! Go!
- All right. Ouch!

350
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:33,541
Easy, easy. That thing hurts!
Easy, easy. Stop!

351
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:34,625
Elia?

352
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:38,041
- Sweetheart?
- My mom is coming.

353
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:41,625
Okay, no problem. Just close the window,
draw the curtains and then...

354
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,000
Elia?

355
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:47,625
And don't ever come back!

356
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,666
Sweetheart, is everything all right?

357
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:55,000
Yes.

358
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:56,500
I just heard a noise.

359
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:58,583
It could be Santa's reindeers.

360
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:00,916
No, really. Just a bad dream.

361
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:03,541
- What were you dreaming about?
- Nothing.

362
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:05,458
Are you sure you're fine?

363
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:08,416
Yes, I'm fine.
Good night. See you tomorrow.

364
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:11,375
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

365
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,208
But... how...

366
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:05,875
I'll fix you now.

367
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,416
{\an8}The reindeer!

368
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,750
{\an8}DECEMBER 22ND

369
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,125
Mom?

370
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,208
Do you think elves are real?

371
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:30,916
Look at me. What do you think?

372
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,833
Come on, you know what I mean.

373
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:35,666
Of course they're real.
Elves, gnomes, fairies,

374
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,250
all the fantasy creatures.
I saw one when I was a child.

375
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:41,750
What did it look like?
Did it have pointy ears?

376
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:43,375
Yes, and it sparkled.

377
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:44,833
- Sparkled?
- Yup.

378
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:45,833
His hands?

379
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:48,541
His hands, feet, ears, everywhere.

380
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:51,291
I always tell you, "Never stop dreaming."

381
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,333
Brush your teeth.

382
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:18,750
{\an8}THE DEVIL'S LEAP
1,742 METERS -5°C

383
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:23,625
Here he is.

384
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,083
Hello.

385
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:30,625
Hello.

386
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:33,666
Look, I thought about it all night long.

387
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,958
I don't want you killing yourself
on a sled for a FantasiCard.

388
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,666
I can't back out now.

389
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:40,833
Elia, just think about it for a second.

390
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:44,750
You can't even ride a bike, what are your
chances on a sled down Death Peak?

391
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,958
You're way too young to die.

392
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:48,708
You haven't even made out with anyone.

393
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:51,458
Do you want to go instead?

394
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:55,458
Me? You know I'm afraid of heights.
I'd die on that thing.

395
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,375
I still haven't made out
with anyone either.

396
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:05,291
No! Forget it, no way.

397
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,541
But I have made out, unlike you two.

398
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,750
What? Who with?

399
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,500
There they are.

400
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,416
The clowns of the valley.

401
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,250
Hi, dwarf. Ready to suffer?

402
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,041
Scared, are you?
I'll wait for you at the top.

403
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,125
Hi, Giada.

404
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:29,625
See you at the bottom.

405
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:32,416
Are you sure about that?

406
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:00,750
You're dead.

407
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,083
Let's go!

408
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:45,875
Get out of my way!

409
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:54,875
You're still in my way!

410
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,500
Now I'll show you.

411
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:07,500
Bye!

412
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:18,708
Elia the kid? Trip here, can you hear me?

413
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,875
What? How is this possible?

414
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:26,833
Yesterday, when you told me
about the race, I made some adjustments.

415
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:27,916
What?

416
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:31,583
If you'll excuse me, I'll take control of
the situation before you break your neck.

417
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:32,750
What?

418
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:36,125
Let's make a deal.
I'll save your life and let you win,

419
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:38,916
but in return you'll write
my return-letter and bye-bye, okay?

420
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:42,166
Okay, all right. Do whatever you want.
I accept, I accept!

421
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:45,500
I love the smell of ski wax
in the morning.

422
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,041
No! No! No!

423
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,000
<i>Come on, the snow is melting.</i>

424
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,291
Now get me out of the way!

425
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,125
I'm going to die! I'm going to die!

426
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm sorry!

427
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,750
If the sled didn't have a kid on top,
it would go much faster.

428
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:18,916
Yeah!

429
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:21,750
Let's take a shortcut.

430
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:25,041
Trip!

431
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,458
I'll never overtake him!

432
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,083
Come on, we're almost there!

433
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,666
Is he really catching up?

434
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,166
And now the grand finale.

435
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,416
Help me!

436
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:57,625
I know I'm gonna die!

437
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:00,041
I haven't made out yet!

438
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:02,291
Remember when I said I made
"some adjustments"?

439
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:04,375
I actually meant great improvements.

440
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:09,750
Trip!

441
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:12,791
What the...

442
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:19,250
Trip! Please stop this thing!

443
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:23,625
Take this, reindeer snot!

444
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,083
Damn you!

445
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:35,791
Here he is!

446
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:38,500
Yeah! Well done!

447
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:41,958
Yahoo! I won a fine return-letter.

448
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:46,291
You won, you won!

449
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:48,333
Come on up. You were great!

450
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:50,125
How did you ride so well?

451
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,166
Where did you get this sled?

452
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:56,916
At my mom's shop!

453
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:59,083
And she has loads more toys.

454
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:09,166
It doesn't end here! Got it?

455
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,166
Let's go!

456
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:17,333
You know what? You can keep your elf card!

457
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:22,708
Come here, guys.

458
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:24,875
I have to tell you a secret.

459
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:29,000
Make sure you don't screw me over.

460
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:31,500
Make sure you don't screw me over.

461
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:33,208
Testing, one, two, three, here I am.

462
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,083
Make sure you don't screw me over,
get it?

463
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,375
Trip, let's get this straight.

464
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:41,583
You want your return-letter
and I want to save my mom's shop.

465
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:44,000
And everyone wants your toys.

466
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:48,916
I promise you that, by the end of it
you'll get your letter by Christmas, okay?

467
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,208
Do they all really want my toys?

468
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:54,875
So, tooth fairies are real, too!

469
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:57,083
Yes, and they live in cavities.

470
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:00,750
Is she dumb or what?

471
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:03,208
Tooth fairies? Come on!

472
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:06,166
This guy doesn't look like
a Santa elf to me.

473
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,625
Listen, reindeer pie,

474
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,291
I'll give you a whacking you won't forget!

475
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,416
Look, boy. Be good or I'll hurt you.

476
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:16,083
- Elia? Sweetie?
- My mom is coming. Go!

477
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:18,416
I'll have a quick sandwich
and run to the shop.

478
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,375
Guess what?
Everyone is going crazy over my toys!

479
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:22,333
Hi, kids.

480
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:24,375
- Mom?
- Yes?

481
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,250
- I have something to tell you.
- What?

482
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,708
You know what I was telling you
this morning about elves?

483
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,250
Yes.

484
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:37,083
Well... So... I've got an elf.

485
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:40,000
An elf? Are you okay, sweetheart?

486
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:56,250
Finally, someone well-dressed around here.

487
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:57,791
Nice one, what is it?

488
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:00,416
A locomotive.
But a bit too dull, isn't it?

489
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,083
We could make some upgrades to it.

490
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:05,750
We could give it wings to make it fly.

491
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:07,708
I like your thinking.

492
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,333
<i>Voilà!</i>

493
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,833
A real Santa's little helper!

494
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:24,958
Yes, they're real.

495
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:29,083
Great to meet you. I'm Ivana, Elia's mom.

496
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:30,458
Nice to meet you. I'm Trip.

497
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,583
So, what are we gonna do now?

498
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,416
Well, let's make some toys.

499
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:43,083
{\an8}CIOCCA'S SECRET WAREHOUSE

500
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:47,416
Come on, don't be sad, son.

501
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:50,083
A little failure could happen to anybody.

502
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:53,458
Listen to your father.
Happens to me all the time, too.

503
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:55,375
But I don't want to be like you.

504
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,833
Look, your father loves you,

505
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:02,958
and he's about to close a major deal.

506
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,291
Yeah, whatever. You say that every year.

507
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:08,458
One day, you'll be a grown-up, too,

508
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:11,791
and you'll learn
that winning isn't easy.

509
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:13,750
That's it... We're almost done.

510
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:18,083
But remember...
No matter how many times you fall,

511
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,666
what counts is how many you get back up.

512
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:27,750
At least show
some more respect for your father.

513
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:32,083
Hurry up with those crates!
Speed it up with these Buddy Buddies!

514
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:44,500
Vittorio!

515
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,041
THE ELVES' FACTORY

516
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:55,208
{\an8}DECEMBER 23RD

517
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,250
Perfect.

518
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:16,458
- I want to touch the ears!
- They're real.

519
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,875
Is it the toy you want?
Look what it does...

520
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:24,708
Look, did you see that? Are we getting it?

521
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,875
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

522
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:31,500
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

523
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:34,541
What would you like, beautiful girl?

524
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:35,833
A doll.

525
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,250
A doll...

526
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:41,083
Yes, we've got plenty,
and we can customize them, too.

527
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:45,000
Dad! The ship, the ship!

528
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:48,333
- Didn't you want a Buddy Buddy?
- No, it sucks.

529
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:50,750
I want a ship that shoots candies.

530
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,166
All right, then. Let's get
a candy-shooting ship to...

531
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,333
To shoot down the dentist.

532
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:59,958
All right. Shall we write down
a candy-shooting ship?

533
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,416
- Yes indeed.
- Okay.

534
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:03,583
It'll be ready by tomorrow afternoon.
All right?

535
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:04,625
- Perfect.
- Okay.

536
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:06,625
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

537
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:09,333
- Hello.
- Hello.

538
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:10,791
- There's my mom.
- Here I am.

539
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:14,083
So your wrestler teddy bear
will be ready by tonight. Happy?

540
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:16,250
Can I place an order, too?

541
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:18,833
- Now, Marta? Look at the chaos there is.
- Please.

542
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,791
I'd like some crayons
that can bring a unicorn to life.

543
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:23,958
- I want them, too.
- So do I. Two boxes.

544
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:26,291
We can't make those, sorry.

545
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:28,708
You consider yourself a salesman?
Let me handle this.

546
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:29,666
What would you like?

547
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:31,750
Crayons that can bring a unicorn to life.

548
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:35,333
What if I made you a crayon case

549
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:39,500
with only one crayon
that can turn into any color you wish?

550
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:41,750
What do you say?

551
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:42,791
That sucks.

552
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,041
Okay. You go on with this one, then.

553
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:47,416
Come on, we're best friends!

554
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:52,250
What is he looking at?

555
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:56,500
- Sorry, I have to go.
- Go get it.

556
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,208
Be a good boy.

557
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,375
Hi, Giada. How can I help you?

558
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:06,583
I was looking for a toy for Attila.

559
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,041
You came to the right place.

560
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,583
Baby? Which one do you want?

561
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:16,875
Look. He likes elves.

562
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:20,375
After all, who doesn't like elves?

563
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,500
So cute. How old is he?

564
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,041
Time to go to the lab...
See you later.

565
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:30,958
This place is cool.

566
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,500
Never been here before.

567
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,708
And you haven't seen the lab yet.
It's pretty cool.

568
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,666
I can show you around if you want to.

569
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,375
How about a bike ride instead?

570
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,625
Right now?

571
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:45,416
It's just... I need to help my mom out.

572
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:48,083
You see, it's so busy,
we need to sell toys...

573
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:50,750
Right, got it, loser. See you around.

574
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:07,000
We'll do the math now, Buddy Buddy,

575
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:08,541
because it's a lot of money.

576
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:13,125
Forty-five items for Mario's newsstand,
that's 1,800 euros.

577
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,916
Thirty for Desolina's newsstand is...

578
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:21,875
Hello?

579
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:23,375
Mario!

580
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:27,000
What do you mean,
you're cancelling your order?

581
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,291
Why?

582
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:39,958
I couldn't stand Mario anyway.
That little mutt.

583
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:41,666
Let's cancel Mario's order...

584
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:54,500
Hello? Desolina!

585
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:59,375
What do you mean
you don't want them anymore? Why?

586
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:03,208
What's Ivana got to do with it?

587
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:25,208
Who is it?

588
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,500
Who's laughing?

589
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:33,750
Who's there?

590
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,208
Santa brings presents to all good kids.

591
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:47,041
But do you know what he brings
the naughty ones?

592
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:49,458
I don't know.

593
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:53,750
- Coal?
- No, not coal.

594
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,708
Naughty kids get...

595
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:58,625
Revenge.

596
00:44:58,875 --> 00:45:01,958
Everyone will pay
for how they're treating you.

597
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:07,291
All you have to do is find out why
Ivana's toys are so special.

598
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:13,250
And then... this year you will be the
Santa Claus of San Nicola al Monte.

599
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:16,750
Yes.

600
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,666
This year I'll be Santa Claus.

601
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:35,625
What is wrong with you?
You're so dumb.

602
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:39,583
She asked you out
and you missed the chance!

603
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:41,125
Lower your voice!

604
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:44,041
It wasn't a date, anyway.

605
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,958
These days I can't be distracted.
I need to concentrate on the shop.

606
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:49,916
Come on. You're making excuses.

607
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:53,333
You crapped your pants because you
had to tell her you can't ride a bike.

608
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,083
You don't get it.
My parents had a fight about the shop,

609
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:59,041
which is mainly a pain in the neck.

610
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:02,791
My mom doesn't know how to handle it.

611
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:06,333
But with the elf,
I can make things better

612
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,500
and bring my dad back.

613
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,791
As you wish.

614
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:13,458
But my dad always tells me

615
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:17,125
you can't win them all.

616
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,166
At least you talk with your dad.

617
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:22,541
See you tomorrow.

618
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:41,416
- There you go. What do you think?
- It's nice.

619
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:45,041
- Shall we make the horse fly?
- Why not?

620
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:53,125
Is it true that if the shop goes well,
your husband will come back?

621
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:56,500
Did Elia tell you that?

622
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:59,541
I think that's why he doesn't let me
go back to the Pole.

623
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:03,458
He's obsessed with running the shop,
everything being perfect.

624
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:06,375
Since his father and I broke up,
he's been acting like an adult.

625
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:10,166
I'm doing my best to distract him
to let him play, but...

626
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:11,916
He wants everything under control.

627
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:15,166
In the meantime,
he's wasting his childhood.

628
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:18,833
Maybe you could help him out.

629
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:20,333
Are you talking to me?

630
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,666
Maybe something isn't too clear.

631
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:27,291
If I don't get back to the Pole, I'm dead!
Gone! Pushing up daisies. All right?

632
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:30,541
Let's say that surviving is
my top priority at the moment.

633
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,708
Sure, sure, I'm sorry, you're right.
He still has a father, anyway.

634
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:37,833
Don't worry, though,
childhood is like riding a bike.

635
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:39,000
You never forget it.

636
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:41,291
It's a shame that Elia can't ride a bike.

637
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:43,208
His father never taught him.

638
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:44,875
Come on, this man is a mess.

639
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:46,916
He is, a little.

640
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:49,625
I'll finish wrapping,
tidy up and close the shop.

641
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:51,291
- Can you take care of Elia?
- Okay.

642
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:52,291
Thanks.

643
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:55,666
A planet has fallen off.

644
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:58,500
Yeah, that one's faulty.
I'll fix it later.

645
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:07,708
- I can't see him doing this.
- You're not gonna make it.

646
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:09,583
Any of the three of you.

647
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:17,833
Did you see what I've done?
These people can't even get to 100!

648
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:21,125
Elia!

649
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:26,333
It's me. I disguised myself
so no one would notice me.

650
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:28,208
Look, Mommy! An elf!

651
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,333
What are you standing here for?

652
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:34,125
Nothing, I was heading back home.

653
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,875
Listen... Do you trust me?

654
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:42,875
What? Why?

655
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:44,833
- What? Are you crazy?
- Follow me!

656
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:49,916
Be quiet. Copy me.
Come with me. Quick! Follow me!

657
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:54,375
Go, Vittorio!
This time you'll get it!

658
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,416
Let's go, I'm bored. Come on.

659
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,250
You're not that strong, anyway.

660
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:06,750
Me? I scored 300, you guys only got 200.

661
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,000
- Shut up, you idiot!
- Whatever.

662
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:10,708
They stole my bike!

663
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:12,125
Who cares about yours.

664
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:15,291
What do you mean who cares?
Attila was in it.

665
00:49:15,416 --> 00:49:17,083
Do what you want. I'll look for mine.

666
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:21,250
Just go. I don't need you anyway,
you hear me?

667
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:25,291
I know you can't ride a bike, you know.

668
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:28,166
Who told you? Mom?

669
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:31,208
- As soon as I get home, you'll see...
- Forget about it!

670
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,958
If you can't, it's because
nobody ever taught you.

671
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:35,833
But you're in luck now.

672
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:38,041
I'll be your teacher. Hop on.

673
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:39,583
- Hop on.
- No, but...

674
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:40,708
You have to, come on.

675
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:43,625
- But I can't...
- Hold the bike and hop on. Look.

676
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:46,000
- Like this. It's easy, isn't it?
- I'm scared.

677
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:48,541
Don't be. Hop on and do as I do.

678
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:50,333
- But I can't ride it.
- Ready?

679
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:52,125
- If I catch you, I'll kill you!
- Okay.

680
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:53,708
Now ride, come on!

681
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:56,083
What do you mean, ride? Oh, God.

682
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:06,500
See? I knew you were a natural.

683
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:09,541
Trip, this is awesome!

684
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,000
I can't believe I'm riding a bike.

685
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:14,791
- Told you.
- Feels like flying!

686
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:16,583
You said it!

687
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:21,958
What's going on?

688
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:24,041
Trip!

689
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:27,041
Trip! I'm flying!

690
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:28,916
I'm flying!

691
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:31,583
Yes!

692
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,625
Don't look down, keep calm.

693
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,583
In the North Pole,
we do this every Sunday!

694
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,166
We call it <i>Güttandlar.</i>

695
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:40,958
Come on, let's go!

696
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:45,083
Where? Trip, wait up!

697
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,375
You're doing great! Follow me!

698
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:48,958
Come on!

699
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,750
You'll thank me in a little while.

700
00:50:57,458 --> 00:50:58,791
Nice, isn't it?

701
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:04,250
It's fantastic!!

702
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:09,416
I can't believe it, I'm flying!

703
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:10,833
Believe it!

704
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:15,250
It's great! Thanks, Trip!

705
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:22,500
Yes!

706
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,083
It's amazing!

707
00:51:34,666 --> 00:51:35,708
Who's there? A dog?

708
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,625
Calm down!

709
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:40,791
Calm down! Calm down!

710
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:43,916
Trip!

711
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:46,791
Trip!

712
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:49,958
Trip!

713
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,333
Trip! Help!

714
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:59,291
I knew it. I'm gonna die! Help!

715
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:02,333
- No, I'm saying help!
- Help!

716
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:04,333
Help!

717
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,500
Trip!

718
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:13,541
Attila!

719
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:15,708
Attila!

720
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,500
Why?

721
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:20,166
Attila!

722
00:52:21,541 --> 00:52:22,833
Attila!

723
00:52:29,166 --> 00:52:30,458
I missed you so much.

724
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:33,666
Hi, sweetie. What happened?

725
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:36,000
Oh, my, what a crash!

726
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:38,750
Oh, my, what a crash.

727
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:58,208
Hi Attila. We found your Giada.

728
00:52:58,416 --> 00:52:59,541
It's the other way around.

729
00:53:00,083 --> 00:53:02,416
Thieves! You're just thieves!

730
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:04,791
You stole my bike and my dog!

731
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:08,583
Damn it!
You're being unfair to the kid here!

732
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:15,166
After the mighty youngster Elia saw
your dog spring out of the basket

733
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,916
and run on the thoroughfare,
he borrowed your bike

734
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,791
ready to face the danger
to save this canine's life.

735
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:25,458
I myself witnessed
this heroic deed.

736
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:27,250
One, two, three, I'm all right now.

737
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:31,166
Is this true?

738
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,875
I'll die before Christmas if I'm lying.

739
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:37,416
Giada. That's a watch for dyslexic people.

740
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,375
No, you're wrong.

741
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:42,750
But thank you.

742
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:45,625
I had no idea you were so reckless.

743
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,791
Danger is my middle name.

744
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:52,083
Nice.

745
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:53,833
See you around.

746
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:57,083
Let's go, sweetie. Come on.

747
00:53:57,666 --> 00:54:00,625
That was a nice ice breaker, wasn't it?

748
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,125
I earned my letter now, didn't I?

749
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:04,791
Let's go.

750
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,208
Oh, my God!

751
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:39,541
Ivana, damn lunatic!

752
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:00,000
Thank you...

753
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:07,375
What now?

754
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:10,333
"Dear Santa Calus?"

755
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,625
Who is Santa "Calus"?

756
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:14,625
It's Santa Claus! Spell it.
Santa Claus, Santa Claus.

757
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:15,541
Okay?

758
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,291
It's important. It's the return-letter.

759
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:19,583
All right, all right.

760
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,708
- Okay.
- Okay.

761
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,750
Let's say it's okay.

762
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:30,750
Do you think writing a letter
is easy for me?

763
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,791
It's so hard.

764
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,541
You have no idea. How do we send it now?

765
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:38,166
How? Like a normal letter. You seal it...

766
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:41,833
And then you put this stamp on.

767
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:43,208
An elven stamp.

768
00:55:43,416 --> 00:55:45,000
You put it on and...

769
00:55:49,208 --> 00:55:50,958
It'll get to the North Pole in an instant.

770
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:53,125
Can I do it, if you don't mind?

771
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:54,625
- Sure.
- Elia?

772
00:55:55,708 --> 00:55:57,083
Elia, is that you?

773
00:55:57,291 --> 00:55:59,666
Mom! I learned how to ride a bike!

774
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:01,583
I can ride a bike!

775
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,916
- Did you go very fast?
- I was flying!

776
00:56:06,291 --> 00:56:08,541
- Trip taught me.
- You flew?

777
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,833
"Flew" is a big word.
A meter, meter and a half, tops.

778
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:14,041
My sweet baby!

779
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:15,791
Good for you!

780
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:18,375
Mom, don't call me that. I'm 10.

781
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,500
Right. You're the man of the house.

782
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:23,166
Trip, do you really have to go?

783
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,875
Can't you ask to stay a little bit longer?

784
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:29,000
Unfortunately, I can't stay.
But that's why

785
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:31,375
I want to give you
your Christmas present early.

786
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:32,708
- Really?
- Yes.

787
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:34,500
Look. It's all yours.

788
00:56:34,875 --> 00:56:35,791
A pair of binoculars.

789
00:56:35,916 --> 00:56:38,583
Actually, these are Binocul-hearts.
My latest invention.

790
00:56:38,666 --> 00:56:41,750
You can see anyone you love
through them. Even if they're far away.

791
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:43,833
- I can see Dad!
- Sure.

792
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:45,916
Oh, my God. No.

793
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:52,875
That's him! Here he is!

794
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,333
- There are privacy issues.
- Dad!

795
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,291
Dad!

796
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:02,375
What do you think?

797
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,000
Why?

798
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:23,458
What nonsense! Binocul-hearts!
I'm a magical elf, but this is too much...

799
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:24,416
Liars!

800
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:26,750
You're all a bunch of liars!

801
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:28,208
- My sweet baby...
- You!

802
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:30,583
You're a lunatic liar!

803
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:33,500
He's not coming back for Christmas,
you lied about everything!

804
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:36,125
- I swear he told me...
- It's not true!

805
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:37,500
How about a bike ride?

806
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,416
You have your letter now,

807
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:43,000
get out of my house,
I never want to see you again! Go!

808
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:45,500
Out! Get out! Go away!

809
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:29,666
Good Lord!

810
00:58:34,666 --> 00:58:37,625
How did I end up like this?

811
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:42,291
And you?

812
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:44,875
What the hell are you staring at?

813
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:47,083
It's all your fault!

814
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,500
And your fault only.

815
00:58:52,416 --> 00:58:56,291
"Buy Buddy Buddies, Ciocca!
They're a great deal!

816
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:58,125
"Every kid wants one.

817
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:01,541
"And they're so hard to find,
almost impossible!

818
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:05,666
"You'll make a fortune.

819
00:59:06,416 --> 00:59:08,708
"You'll pay back all your debts."

820
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:19,916
Instead, now that
nobody wants you anymore,

821
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:22,416
you'll be the ruin of me!

822
00:59:23,916 --> 00:59:28,208
Damn, stupid,
useless stinky monsters!

823
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:43,000
No, Ciocca. No.

824
00:59:50,916 --> 00:59:52,083
Who was that?

825
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:56,375
Did you speak?

826
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,083
Tell me, my Buddy Buddy friend.

827
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:04,625
Tell me.

828
01:00:06,791 --> 01:00:10,250
You're so close, Ciocca, so close.

829
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:12,041
Don't screw it up now!

830
01:00:14,291 --> 01:00:15,875
But I don't know what to do anymore.

831
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:18,333
People reject them.

832
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:20,458
People don't want them.

833
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,541
What should I do?

834
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:26,250
Darn it, you blockhead!

835
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:31,208
You have to play with them to find out
why Ivana's toys are so special.

836
01:00:34,916 --> 01:00:40,000
Right. Thanks, my Buddy Buddy friend.
Thank you for the advice.

837
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:09,416
The goose is cooked.

838
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:49,416
My car, no.

839
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:52,916
My car! Not my car.

840
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:54,750
Not the car!

841
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:58,708
No! Not the car!

842
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,458
How is all this possible?

843
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:26,833
I'm sorry for what happened.

844
01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:30,166
It's just that sometimes I do things
without thinking.

845
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:35,000
If on one hand that makes me
a great crafter elf, on the other hand...

846
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:36,791
it gets me in trouble with friends.

847
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:39,250
Now, I can't really say we're friends,

848
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:42,666
but we spent some time together
over the last few days, didn't we?

849
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,791
Elia, could you at least ans...

850
01:03:46,916 --> 01:03:49,250
Vittorio, what are you doing here
at this hour?

851
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,875
Dad, maybe we're going too far?

852
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:04,458
Oh, yes.

853
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,791
You have no idea how far.

854
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:17,875
{\an8}DECEMBER 24TH

855
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:33,333
Good morning,

856
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,416
crafter elf!

857
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:37,750
What?

858
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,625
I get it.

859
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:42,000
I get it.

860
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:46,083
Is it the ears? It's a genetic deformation
I was born with.

861
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:49,666
If I dressed normally, everyone would say,
"Look at those ears!" But...

862
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:52,500
All right, I'm an elf, yes.
But please let me go.

863
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:56,250
If I'm not back at the Pole by Christmas,
I'm doomed. My time is running out.

864
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:58,416
- You're running out of time?
- Yes.

865
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:00,125
Then you know exactly how I feel.

866
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:02,708
I don't have much time either.

867
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:05,000
Untie me, please.

868
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:07,500
Yeah, you wish.
You want me to untie you?

869
01:05:09,708 --> 01:05:12,333
Sure, why not? Right away, my dear.

870
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:13,916
- Sure, there you go.
- Thank you.

871
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:18,916
What are you talking about? What?

872
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,291
"Untie me."

873
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:25,333
You really want to go back home?

874
01:05:25,833 --> 01:05:27,791
- Yes.
- Really?

875
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:33,791
I can send you back there,
but first you have to do something for me.

876
01:05:34,291 --> 01:05:35,375
What?

877
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:40,416
You have to give my toys
that certain something

878
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:43,250
- that all kids want.
- Yes. Okay.

879
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:45,208
You have to bring them...

880
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:47,916
to life. All of them.

881
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,375
All the Buddy Buddies. Alive!

882
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:53,833
- Alive!
- Yes!

883
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:56,875
- Alive! All the Buddy Buddies.
- Gotcha. Okay.

884
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,791
They have to walk.

885
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:00,750
They have to talk.

886
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,250
They have to move.

887
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,833
- They have to jump.
- Got it. Okay.

888
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:07,625
They have to say, "Hi, kid. How are you?"

889
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,958
"Hi, kid. I'm your Buddy Buddy."

890
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:11,916
"Hi, I'm your best friend."

891
01:06:12,125 --> 01:06:14,250
"Hi, kid. Do you want to play with me?"

892
01:06:14,958 --> 01:06:16,541
- Got it?
- Yes.

893
01:06:16,625 --> 01:06:17,791
They have to do everything.

894
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:22,625
Otherwise, I'll send you home...
but on the 26th!

895
01:06:25,541 --> 01:06:27,083
How does an elf die?

896
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:29,416
Do you melt like snow?

897
01:06:29,541 --> 01:06:31,500
Burst like a star? How?

898
01:06:31,833 --> 01:06:32,708
Like anyone else.

899
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:34,625
Really? I'd like to see that.

900
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:36,666
Nothing special, just a regular death,

901
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,541
- a death...
- What do you mean?

902
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:39,791
We just keel over.

903
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:43,250
- How do you mean?
- Like this.

904
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,041
Simply dead.

905
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:53,875
Can I come in?

906
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:13,083
Why did he leave us?

907
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:16,750
He didn't leave us.

908
01:07:18,708 --> 01:07:20,333
We broke up.

909
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:26,083
Things between us
hadn't been working for a while.

910
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:28,708
But he will always love you.

911
01:07:30,125 --> 01:07:32,500
And he will come see you
every chance he gets.

912
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:36,250
You're always on his mind.

913
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:43,958
I thought he should tell you,
but apparently, I was wrong.

914
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:48,833
It hasn't been easy for me either.

915
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,333
{\an8}Look.

916
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:12,166
Vittorio and the twins are sticking them
on every wall in town.

917
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:14,750
But this is that thing
that Ciocca wanted me to sell.

918
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:16,125
But it's different.

919
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:18,166
This is uglier.

920
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:21,583
It says it does things no other toy can.

921
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:23,791
That it looks alive.

922
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:26,125
As if by...

923
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:27,791
- Magic.
- Magic.

924
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:30,041
Do you think Trip is behind this?

925
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:30,958
Who else?

926
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:34,708
Why didn't he leave?

927
01:08:35,208 --> 01:08:37,041
Maybe something has kept him here.

928
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:39,333
Something or someone.

929
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,583
They must be here.

930
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,875
- What are you looking for?
- Here they are.

931
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:49,458
Found them.

932
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:51,666
What are they? Binoculars?

933
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:54,416
Oh, no!

934
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:55,958
Buddy Buddy!

935
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:58,541
Give me a break. Let me catch my breath.

936
01:08:58,666 --> 01:09:00,416
Buddy Buddy!

937
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:04,791
Oh, no! Trip is a prisoner,
he's being tortured.

938
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,458
Can you figure out where he is?

939
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,375
No.

940
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:11,125
We need real weapons to set him free.

941
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,250
You don't need weapons.

942
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:16,875
You need imagination.

943
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,125
You don't get it. We do need weapons.
They have an army of monsters.

944
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:23,791
We'll use his own creations
to set him free.

945
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:26,041
You try to figure out
where they're hiding him.

946
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:27,708
Meet me later at the shop, okay?

947
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,750
Here's another one.

948
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:37,333
If we follow the flyers,

949
01:09:37,416 --> 01:09:39,750
they could lead us
to the Buddy Buddy factory, right?

950
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,208
Sure, like we're in
Tom Thumb's fairy tale.

951
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:45,125
There's another one there.

952
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,416
Isn't that Trip's hat?

953
01:10:02,791 --> 01:10:04,833
If he's not home by midnight...

954
01:10:04,916 --> 01:10:06,166
There are no more flyers.

955
01:10:06,916 --> 01:10:08,333
The trail ends here.

956
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:11,000
I shouldn't have kicked him out.

957
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:13,291
Do you need help?

958
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:17,333
Please, Giada, don't you start.

959
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:20,958
Too bad. I thought
you were looking for your friend.

960
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:23,041
- Do you know where he is?
- No.

961
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:25,958
But I overheard Vittorio and the twins
talking about it.

962
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,583
Aren't they your friends?

963
01:10:27,666 --> 01:10:29,833
They're not my friends, all right?

964
01:10:30,416 --> 01:10:32,791
What if we let your dog smell Trip's hat?

965
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:34,500
He could pick up his tracks, right?

966
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:36,583
Attila? Are you crazy?

967
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:39,416
Please, Giada,
it's a matter of life and death.

968
01:10:41,166 --> 01:10:42,083
Trip...

969
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,875
is one of Santa's little helpers.

970
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:49,125
Sure. And I'm a reindeer.

971
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:50,625
I swear, Giada!

972
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:52,833
We only have eight hours to save him.

973
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:54,708
He's not human.

974
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,958
He's different.

975
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:57,875
If we don't help him out...

976
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,458
he'll die.

977
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,333
Trust me.

978
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:35,166
To you, who can draw anything you imagine,

979
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:38,000
I give the power
of bringing it to life!

980
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:40,375
- Wonderful, thank you!
- You're welcome!

981
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:49,208
The hornet, with its wing structure
and its weight,

982
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:51,000
shouldn't be able to fly.

983
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:53,041
But it doesn't care and flies anyway.

984
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:55,833
And to you, my dear Fabio,

985
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:59,250
I give the power of flying.

986
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:02,250
But I'm afraid of heights.

987
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:04,875
Who cares? Beggars can't be choosers.

988
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,500
Giada,

989
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:10,208
to you, instead,

990
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:14,750
I give the power
to stand up for yourself.

991
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:18,583
Thank you. I can throw punches
without the gloves as well, you know?

992
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:19,958
Right!

993
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:21,625
- Can I have them instead?
- No!

994
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:23,875
You've got the hat. Stop complaining!

995
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:26,333
But I told you I'm afraid of heights.

996
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:31,666
And to you, my son,

997
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:34,750
I give... I give...

998
01:12:35,666 --> 01:12:36,958
a backpack.

999
01:12:38,791 --> 01:12:39,833
A backpack?

1000
01:12:40,541 --> 01:12:43,541
I thought I would have an advantage
as I'm your son.

1001
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:45,708
Come on. Let's go free Trip.

1002
01:12:46,291 --> 01:12:47,583
It's not that easy.

1003
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:49,625
We'll take care of the boys.

1004
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:51,166
But to free Trip,

1005
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:53,125
we need something more.

1006
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:54,666
Such as?

1007
01:12:58,208 --> 01:12:59,250
I've got an idea.

1008
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:10,250
Stay still, stay still!

1009
01:13:13,875 --> 01:13:16,125
Trip has to be somewhere around here.

1010
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:18,291
Yes, but how do we get in?

1011
01:13:23,541 --> 01:13:24,708
It's locked.

1012
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:28,208
I'll see if there's an entrance
on the other side.

1013
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:32,125
Please be careful and quiet, okay?

1014
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:35,000
Don't worry, I'll be as quiet as a ninja.

1015
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:02,541
What now?

1016
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:08,666
Ta-da!

1017
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,041
You gross creature!

1018
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:18,875
Get lost!

1019
01:14:20,416 --> 01:14:21,458
Giada...

1020
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,541
It's all right, really.
Stop, it's all right.

1021
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:30,750
Let's go, guys.

1022
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:38,250
So? Are we going?

1023
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,458
What if we all die?

1024
01:15:00,541 --> 01:15:01,708
I made out.

1025
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:33,666
Hey there...

1026
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:36,500
Are you still there?

1027
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:39,375
Let's hope so.

1028
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:43,083
Look what I've got for you.

1029
01:15:46,916 --> 01:15:48,125
A little toy.

1030
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:51,041
You like it, don't you?

1031
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,458
Hurry up with these crates.

1032
01:16:29,541 --> 01:16:32,541
I'll deliver presents
to all the good kids in the country

1033
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:34,083
who pay good money for them.

1034
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:36,291
My loyal assistants,

1035
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,416
we have to be finished by midnight.

1036
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:42,708
I'll be Santa Claus this year,
even if I'm slimmer.

1037
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,875
Hornet!

1038
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:53,333
Ouch, it hurts!

1039
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:54,500
Fabio, are you okay?

1040
01:16:54,708 --> 01:16:57,333
Hey, what the hell are you doing here?

1041
01:16:57,583 --> 01:17:01,000
I made out! I made out! I made out!

1042
01:17:05,291 --> 01:17:07,083
Damn, that hurt.

1043
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:12,125
Let Trip go,
or you'll have to deal with us!

1044
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:14,791
Here they are. Two girls and two midgets.

1045
01:17:15,375 --> 01:17:16,541
I'm shaking.

1046
01:17:17,791 --> 01:17:20,125
Hey! The elf is mine.

1047
01:17:20,791 --> 01:17:22,291
The warehouse is mine.

1048
01:17:23,041 --> 01:17:25,000
And everything will be mine!

1049
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:28,500
Get out of here now
or I'll have you kicked out.

1050
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:30,250
Let him go, or he'll die.

1051
01:17:30,833 --> 01:17:32,916
How can he die
if he doesn't even exist, boy?

1052
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,875
- Kick them out.
- We'll take care of them.

1053
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Well done, son.

1054
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,375
Now we'll see who the real losers are.

1055
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:51,333
I'll take care of her.

1056
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,833
Oh, God. Where did he go?

1057
01:17:58,208 --> 01:18:00,833
Now you'll have all the time in the world
to think about it.

1058
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:02,958
No! Stop! Don't close it, stop!

1059
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:06,125
Where are you going? Come here!

1060
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:08,458
Yes!

1061
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:10,000
You want to run away, midget?

1062
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:12,083
- Let me go.
- Get out of my way!

1063
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:13,416
What's this junk?

1064
01:18:13,583 --> 01:18:15,833
- Did you grab it from the dumpster?
- Give it back!

1065
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:17,625
What does it say here?

1066
01:18:18,291 --> 01:18:23,083
{\an8}"Don't... dear... theorwsei...
I'llt teg semsy?"

1067
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:26,166
Dear? Theorwsei?

1068
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:28,375
What does it mean?

1069
01:18:29,291 --> 01:18:30,125
Hey!

1070
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,791
Are you really getting beaten
by a backpack?

1071
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:44,125
Another one of that damn elf's tricks!

1072
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:45,833
Don't get close or you'll get hurt.

1073
01:18:45,916 --> 01:18:48,208
I'll get hurt? I'll hurt you.

1074
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:50,416
Left! Right!

1075
01:18:55,958 --> 01:18:58,750
We'll fight magic with magic.

1076
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:07,625
Come to me, my children!

1077
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:39,166
{\an8}"Warning. Don't read,
or it will get messy."

1078
01:19:46,958 --> 01:19:47,875
Trip!

1079
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:53,916
Trip! Trip, are you okay?

1080
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:55,291
Elia...

1081
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:59,208
I found the letter. I can save you.

1082
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:00,833
But tell me how to send it.

1083
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:01,791
Trip!

1084
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:04,375
The stamp...

1085
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:06,375
No!

1086
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:22,125
Trip!

1087
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:25,125
- Trip?
- What happened?

1088
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:26,416
Is he dead?

1089
01:20:26,541 --> 01:20:29,083
The Buddy Buddies stole my letter.

1090
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:03,000
Oh, my!

1091
01:21:20,291 --> 01:21:21,125
Watch out!

1092
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:27,041
I'll distract him.

1093
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:28,833
Go, great, Fabio. Go.

1094
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:37,041
Fabio, come on! Come on!

1095
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:48,416
Come on!

1096
01:21:51,666 --> 01:21:53,375
Pick on the little ones.

1097
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:54,583
Flying Fists!

1098
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:14,416
Back off!

1099
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:15,875
Let's protect Trip.

1100
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:18,250
Be careful!

1101
01:22:32,958 --> 01:22:35,416
Take cover!

1102
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:41,166
Cover from what?

1103
01:22:48,875 --> 01:22:49,833
From the blob.

1104
01:22:50,875 --> 01:22:51,708
The blob?

1105
01:23:46,583 --> 01:23:49,958
<i>Just don't feed it a dog, a cat or
a kid, or it will...</i>

1106
01:23:50,041 --> 01:23:51,375
Explode!

1107
01:23:56,958 --> 01:23:58,250
It exploded...

1108
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:12,958
Gross!

1109
01:24:27,541 --> 01:24:28,750
The letter.

1110
01:24:58,583 --> 01:24:59,666
Honey!

1111
01:25:01,041 --> 01:25:01,958
Are you okay?

1112
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:09,916
It's Christmas.

1113
01:25:26,416 --> 01:25:27,375
Dad!

1114
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:28,958
Are you all right?

1115
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:31,666
Yes, son. And you?

1116
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:33,625
- Let's say so, yeah.
- Are you okay?

1117
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:42,416
My friend...

1118
01:25:43,541 --> 01:25:45,125
I'm sorry.

1119
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:49,125
I should have invented
a nuclear syrup ship

1120
01:25:49,208 --> 01:25:52,500
with two soda pipes
and a catapult to the North Pole.

1121
01:25:54,166 --> 01:25:55,708
But it's too late now.

1122
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:33,625
What a mess.

1123
01:26:33,875 --> 01:26:34,958
We found him.

1124
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:54,916
Who wrote "Santa Calus"?

1125
01:27:02,875 --> 01:27:04,166
Well done, boy.

1126
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:30,166
Gross!

1127
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:32,125
Was that me?

1128
01:27:32,708 --> 01:27:34,625
Trip!

1129
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:39,666
I haven't seen this in centuries.

1130
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:41,250
Elia the kid.

1131
01:27:41,666 --> 01:27:43,875
It's the best Christmas of my life!

1132
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:47,166
Hi, Brina.

1133
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:48,291
Hello.

1134
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:52,250
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it, Trip.

1135
01:27:54,083 --> 01:27:56,041
I promise I'll be good.

1136
01:27:58,708 --> 01:28:02,458
Make all the magic disappear.
We can't leave any trace.

1137
01:28:03,833 --> 01:28:05,083
Excuse me, Mrs. Elf.

1138
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:08,125
Can I ask you something?

1139
01:28:08,875 --> 01:28:11,125
Will all of Trip's toys disappear?

1140
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:16,875
Don't you worry.

1141
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:20,916
Your toys already have
everything that kids want.

1142
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:38,041
Fancy pants.

1143
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:41,500
It's time to go home.

1144
01:28:41,708 --> 01:28:43,833
Your Giftiness, thank you again.

1145
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:48,958
Trip, this is yours.

1146
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:52,708
No. Elia, don't do this.

1147
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:56,166
You're a grown-up now,
let's not start crying over...

1148
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:58,458
Also, this is not a farewell.

1149
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:00,791
Christmas comes every year, right?

1150
01:29:07,291 --> 01:29:09,000
You'll visit us again, Trip, right?

1151
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:16,666
No, I'm not allowed to.

1152
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:23,791
See you soon, Elia the kid.

1153
01:29:28,625 --> 01:29:29,583
Let's go.

1154
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:34,708
You'll stitch footballs
for the next three centuries.

1155
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:36,083
Ivana!

1156
01:29:37,416 --> 01:29:38,250
Ivana!

1157
01:29:53,958 --> 01:29:56,541
Merry Christmas to everyone!

1158
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:07,916
- Dad!
- Elia!

1159
01:30:08,333 --> 01:30:10,958
Here you are! Where were you?

1160
01:30:11,041 --> 01:30:12,750
I looked everywhere for you.

1161
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:16,291
What is this slime? You're all dirty.

1162
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:18,000
What happened?

1163
01:30:18,291 --> 01:30:19,583
Well, it's a long story.

1164
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:41,500
Dad, we must never stop dreaming.

1165
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:58,625
{\an8}Here it is. Happy holidays!

1166
01:30:58,750 --> 01:30:59,625
{\an8}DECEMBER 25TH

1167
01:30:59,708 --> 01:31:00,541
{\an8}Excuse me!

1168
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:02,833
{\an8}I completely forgot.

1169
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:05,416
I have to pick up the toy I ordered.

1170
01:31:05,666 --> 01:31:08,291
- I hope I'm not too late.
- Of course not, don't worry.

1171
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:10,291
You're not the only one today.

1172
01:31:11,541 --> 01:31:13,541
Here it is. This one should be yours.

1173
01:31:13,833 --> 01:31:15,583
- Happy holidays.
- Thank you.

1174
01:31:15,666 --> 01:31:16,625
Goodbye.

1175
01:31:17,166 --> 01:31:18,833
Ah, the Christmas spirit!

1176
01:31:18,958 --> 01:31:20,583
- Excuse me.
- Yes, how can I help you?

1177
01:31:25,791 --> 01:31:26,750
Ready?

1178
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:29,791
We're waiting outside.

1179
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:36,791
- Come on! Will you hurry up?
- Coming!

1180
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:39,250
My, oh, my, always late.

1181
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:42,666
- Elia, hurry up!
- Where are we going?

1182
01:31:42,791 --> 01:31:45,000
Come on, Elia, you're worse than Fabio.

1183
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:46,083
What d'you want from me?

1184
01:31:47,625 --> 01:31:48,541
Trip!

1185
01:31:49,833 --> 01:31:52,666
Those footballs are not
going to stitch themselves.

1186
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:53,750
Right, Brina.

1187
01:32:06,041 --> 01:32:09,333
MERRY CHRISTMAS

1188
01:32:09,708 --> 01:32:12,166
MERRY CHRISTSAM

1189
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:18,833
NEVER STOP DREAMING

1190
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:28,916
Someone has broken the football
stitching machine in trying to improve it.

1191
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,125
Please refrain from such practices and
stick to the timetable for your shifts.

1192
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:34,208
Keep up the good work.

1193
01:32:35,166 --> 01:32:37,541
Look, for the Buddy Buddies...
Shall I look there?

1194
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:39,916
- Here, yes.
- Or there? Or there?

1195
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,458
- The ladder.
- The ladder.

1196
01:32:43,666 --> 01:32:46,666
<i>C, D, E, F, G, A, B, D, C</i>

1197
01:32:46,875 --> 01:32:50,208
Is it true that if the shop goes well,
your husband will come back?

1198
01:32:52,208 --> 01:32:53,333
Did Elia tell you that?

1199
01:32:57,750 --> 01:33:01,208
Is it true that if the shop goes well,
your husband will come back?

1200
01:33:02,208 --> 01:33:03,375
No, sorry.

1201
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:05,833
You're a nice family. I love you,

1202
01:33:05,916 --> 01:33:10,250
but if I don't get back to the Pole,
I'll die, croak. Crook.

1203
01:33:10,708 --> 01:33:11,541
Okay.

1204
01:33:11,625 --> 01:33:15,333
Don't worry, childhood is like riding
a bike. You never forget it.

1205
01:33:15,791 --> 01:33:17,583
Too bad that Elia can't ride a bike...

1206
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:20,500
Look how good I am. I didn't break it.

1207
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:21,875
Well done, good job.

1208
01:33:22,041 --> 01:33:26,291
Anyway, don't worry,
childhood is like... Yeah, right.

1209
01:33:26,416 --> 01:33:27,583
Childhood. Sorry.

1210
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:32,875
What the... do I do now?

1211
01:33:33,083 --> 01:33:34,500
It's not the top that spins,

1212
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:36,125
it's the house.

1213
01:33:38,583 --> 01:33:39,666
Whose house?

1214
01:33:39,791 --> 01:33:41,875
What did I say? House?
What was I supposed to say?

1215
01:33:41,958 --> 01:33:43,375
- The room.
- The room, right.

1216
01:33:44,125 --> 01:33:47,458
Look at you, you weird creature.
You're gross.

1217
01:33:47,541 --> 01:33:48,791
You're gross, you know that?

1218
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:51,166
Are all elves like you?

1219
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:52,833
I'm one of the best.

1220
01:33:53,041 --> 01:33:54,541
Imagine the others.

1221
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:01,875
Here's another one.

1222
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:08,166
Well, okay.

1223
01:34:12,791 --> 01:34:14,166
Well, it was falling.

1224
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:15,500
Here's another one.

1225
01:34:21,916 --> 01:34:23,166
The Buddy Buddies, alive!

1226
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:24,500
Sure, sure.

1227
01:34:24,666 --> 01:34:25,833
Buddy Buddies!

1228
01:34:27,416 --> 01:34:28,625
Buddy Buddies!

1229
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:30,416
I can't take it!

1230
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:34,416
The weather station predicts
a giant and colossal...

1231
01:34:34,666 --> 01:34:36,458
What the... am I saying? All right.

1232
01:34:36,541 --> 01:34:40,583
Attention! To all authorized
personnel... Yeah, right, personnel.

1233
01:34:43,083 --> 01:34:43,916
Okay.

1234
01:34:46,375 --> 01:34:47,916
...off, will you?

1235
01:34:48,458 --> 01:34:51,666
Will Trip manage to get kicked out of...
All right.

1236
01:34:51,875 --> 01:34:53,083
To get... I'll do it again.

1237
01:34:53,208 --> 01:34:56,750
A colossal... A colossal storm...
Sorry, guys.

1238
01:34:56,958 --> 01:34:58,875
The direct... Nothing. Sorry.

1239
01:35:01,166 --> 01:35:02,458
Give me a kiss.

1240
01:35:04,958 --> 01:35:08,083
Since we broke up,
he's been acting like an adult.

1241
01:35:08,166 --> 01:35:11,083
I'm doing my best to distract him,
to let him play, but

1242
01:35:11,166 --> 01:35:13,000
he wants everything under control.

1243
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:14,500
The pencil fell off.

1244
01:35:14,583 --> 01:35:17,208
Let's say that surviving is
my top priority at the moment.

1245
01:35:17,291 --> 01:35:19,333
Sure, sure. Sorry.

1246
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:20,958
Why did you marry him?

1247
01:35:22,458 --> 01:35:23,666
For... sake!

1248
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:24,625
Let me ask again.

1249
01:35:24,708 --> 01:35:27,500
Look, I don't have much time, so...
Sorry, start over.

1250
01:35:27,583 --> 01:35:30,708
It can tidy up all the toys in your...

1251
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:34,291
If on one hand, that makes me
a great crafter elf, on the other hand...

1252
01:35:34,375 --> 01:35:36,166
it gets me in trouble with friends.

1253
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:38,583
Now, I can't really say we're frien...

1254
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,375
Yes, and...

1255
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:47,583
Yes. Put that little boy
who arrives away...

1256
01:35:49,041 --> 01:35:50,125
I'll be the commentator.

1257
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:53,708
"Here it is, we see the blob
entering the..."

1258
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,750
Let's take a shortcut. Yes, it...

1259
01:35:57,250 --> 01:36:02,166
Let's take a shortcut.
I mean, if the sled didn't "been"...

1260
01:36:02,333 --> 01:36:04,875
Sorry, didn't have, not "been."
Didn't "been," what's that?

1261
01:36:04,958 --> 01:36:05,916
Go on, come on.

1262
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:08,083
Time!

1263
01:36:09,875 --> 01:36:11,541
Elia, look, I...

1264
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,416
I give you the power...

1265
01:36:17,958 --> 01:36:21,916
- of this bloody...
- Let's try again.

1266
01:36:23,833 --> 01:36:26,458
I don't have much time, so...
I forgot.

1267
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:29,625
Yes, but my toys give the "chuldren"...

1268
01:36:29,708 --> 01:36:31,666
"Chuldren"? What am I saying?
Let's start over.

1269
01:36:33,208 --> 01:36:34,625
Hands in front.

1270
01:36:35,291 --> 01:36:37,416
What is this green thing
getting closer to me?

1271
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:39,083
- It's the blob.
- The blob?

1272
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:42,875
And it will be harder when
all the other shops

1273
01:36:43,208 --> 01:36:44,708
are selling my stuff.

1274
01:36:46,166 --> 01:36:48,375
- I'm saying...
- Let's pick up from this line.

1275
01:36:49,583 --> 01:36:50,583
Diarrhea.

1276
01:36:50,791 --> 01:36:51,750
Diarrhea?

1277
01:36:52,416 --> 01:36:53,791
What the... did you say?

1278
01:36:53,916 --> 01:36:55,541
Move behind and the pillows in front.

1279
01:36:55,791 --> 01:36:56,916
- Diarrhea?
- Done!

1280
01:36:59,166 --> 01:37:00,500
Hold on, hold on!

1281
01:37:02,791 --> 01:37:03,958
Gross!

1282
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:05,708
- Trip!
- Trip!

1283
01:37:05,833 --> 01:37:08,250
But is that... No, wait, there's a line.

1284
01:37:09,541 --> 01:37:10,875
Lillo.

1285
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:13,500
- Lillo?
- This... Oops. I got it wrong.

1286
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,250
- Trip!
- Trip!

1287
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:22,166
Meant...

1288
01:37:22,416 --> 01:37:24,333
No wait. Hello.

1289
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,083
No. I don't understand.

1290
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,875
There it is. Same as the other one.

1291
01:37:34,333 --> 01:37:36,833
Let's do it again, hold on,
without the slime.

1292
01:37:38,416 --> 01:37:39,583
It's gone.

1293
01:37:41,416 --> 01:37:43,291
- A hairpin. What else can I have?
- Okay, go.

1294
01:37:43,375 --> 01:37:44,208
Stop!

1295
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:45,708
How do you make hair locks?

1296
01:37:45,791 --> 01:37:47,583
With hairpins, my toys are beautiful.

1297
01:37:47,666 --> 01:37:48,500
And...

1298
01:37:54,958 --> 01:37:57,875
Ready to face the danger, he basically...

1299
01:37:57,958 --> 01:37:59,458
Okay, I don't know this one.

1300
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:00,708
Good one!

1301
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:02,041
Mom!

1302
01:38:03,291 --> 01:38:04,541
Cover from what?

1303
01:38:06,833 --> 01:38:08,041
You gave me a heart attack!

1304
01:38:08,166 --> 01:38:09,666
- My gosh!
- He came back to life!

1305
01:38:10,208 --> 01:38:11,541
Let's get back in place.

1306
01:38:12,708 --> 01:38:16,083
I've got talcum powder...
I've got talcum powder up my nose.

1307
01:38:20,125 --> 01:38:22,333
Okay, let's stop.
Ready for the next one.

1308
01:38:22,625 --> 01:38:25,791
Guys, my... are smashed.

1309
01:38:25,916 --> 01:38:27,916
I have to take five. Sorry. I mean...
