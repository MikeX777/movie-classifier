11
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:54,407

00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,945
Don't be late!
Hit with force!

19
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,290
Dear!

20
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,966
Dear! Chakram is not there

21
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,467
<i>I don't like this marriage
Don't search for me! Chakram</i>

22
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,797
- In law!
- Doesn't he like this marriage?

23
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,007
- Sister!
- Au nty!

24
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,976
- Lakshmi, check her
- Aunty, get up!

25
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,490
Go! He wouldn't go a long way!

26
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,996
- Wherever he is, catch him!
- Ok sir!

27
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,185
Search!

28
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,196
Go

29
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,039
Go away!

30
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,884
- Brother!
- Come on!

31
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,283
He is going there!
Come on

32
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:32,252
Chennai!I don't mind if you lose your life

33
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,615
I want him (Chakram)!

34
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:18,958
She is not your daughter but mine!

35
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:26,633
It may be my son, who did
injustice to my daughter...

36
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,981
I'll slash him!

37
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,987
I'll slash him!

38
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,333
Die! I'll die!

39
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,341
This problem will not be solved
until I die!

40
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,337
This is the problem from the day
I married you!

41
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,914
You are complaining about my Mom
and I am complaining about you

42
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:10,384
That's why for the last one week
I am roaming and sleeping in the auto

43
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,523
But you're making calls
to me. Don't shout!

44
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,356
I'll die! -Brother, auto..
- I'll not come!

45
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,196
You won't prosper until I die!

46
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:23,523
I'll die in the Hussain Sagar(River)
or any railway track!

47
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,364
- Brother, please! - I told you
that I won't come. Go

48
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,703
Collect my body at the evening
from Gandhi Hospital!

49
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,200
- Don't shout!
- Brother

50
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,875
I told you that I won't come
Go

51
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,206
Do you want me to explain?
That's what I am telling

52
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,711
You are killing me like this!

53
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,711
You, idiot!
- Please brother

54
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,411
Do you think this is your Dad's auto?
- I want to go back to the mosque brother!

55
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,886
Oh god!

56
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,762
Water!

57
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,566
Where is the water bottle?
Water!

58
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:06,903
- Water!
- Take it

59
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,749
Don't be afraid

60
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,420
I will die within few days

61
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,600
Blood will come out sometimes

62
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,829
- Don't mistake me
I want to tell you something -Tell me

63
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:41,809
Death only will come without inviting
and without doing any hard work

64
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,439
If a person like me cannot live
even if he wants to live

65
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,109
Is it a curse to you?
You have a golden life

66
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:52,347
All problems will be solved if you talk
with your wife and mom

67
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,116
Why are you going to die for this?

68
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,988
You should live
You should fight

69
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,122
But, don't say I'll die!

70
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:06,459
Thanks for giving water. Sorry for
speaking nonsense! I take leave!

71
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,667
I'll drop you
Where do you want to go?

72
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,311
Where do I want to go?

73
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,310
Sahara ironing.com

74
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:23,980
I want a two bedroom flat!

75
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:25,820
Keep the phone down!

76
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,321
When did this wastrel come? Has your
yesterday's stupor not yet come down?

77
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,525
It is not yesterday's stupor
coming down, brother in law!

78
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,163
The stupor that I boozed today
is not mounting up!

79
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,662
- Stop your trumpery!
- When did I do that, brother in law?

80
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:38,860
You have lost colony's security job
because of over boozing!

81
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,169
Your wife...

82
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,672
Your wife working as a maid but you are
boozing and roaming with that money

83
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,107
Am I roaming? I am not
getting the stupor when I booze!

84
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,837
I am a big man, how can I roam?

85
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,678
It is wrong to speak with you
Then give some money to play cards!

86
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,683
Take it!

87
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,518
- This is Sahara Colony!
- Has we reached so quickly?

88
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,687
I'll bring it!
Where is your flat?

89
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:04,357
Here or there or somewhere!
But, it is somewhere in this colony!

90
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,689
- I'll search for it! -I don't want money
from you! -Take it!

91
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,689
- I hit you without knowing about you
- I don't want your money!

92
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,357
- No.
- Take it!

93
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:13,900
What is this?

94
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:23,039
It seems like blood
until it is in our mouth!

95
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,548
That means. 
- That's it!

96
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:27,874
Wait!

97
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,710
What wrong I did to you?
You made me a fool early in the morning!

98
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,721
- Give my money!
- How much?

99
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,725
Rs.50 for auto charge and Rs.200
for making me a fool! Give me!

100
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:37,890
Don't get blessings!

101
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,897
- Take your money!
- Is this money?

102
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,229
How dare you give a paper to me?

103
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:50,567
Hyderabad auto drivers are like
atom bomb! Give money

104
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,900
- Why are you getting angry?
It is money! -Money!

105
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,239
It is Rs.1000

106
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,748
Do you asked me Rs.250?
Keep all the money

107
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,253
Avarice leads to immense loss!

108
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,586
What I want is Rs.1000 Note!

109
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:10,760
It is original!

110
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,428
Don't forget to speak
with your wife and mom!

111
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:17,764
Bye !

Sahara ironing.com

113
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,941
This is the only house I have
Capturing, it is injustice!

114
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,107
Do you love this house so much?

115
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:38,621
You will live only for an year. Then you'll
die! Why do you want this house?

116
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,791
I told you that I'll give money!
I'll pay for it!

117
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:45,953
I have seen a lot of money like that!
Money doesn't have a long life!

118
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,959
Are you telling dialogues?
Don't you do what I said?

119
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,328
- I'll kill you!
- Sir please sir!

120
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,471
- I beg you!
Come this side!

121
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,972
Please sir!

122
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,977
Why should we fight with a rogue!

123
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,637
- Who are you? -He is my grandpa.
I am his grandson!

124
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,975
I am his grandson
He is my grandpa!

125
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,179
Because he is old, he is behaving like this
He doesn't know about you

126
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:16,156
We'll not fight with you!
Leave him for my sake!

127
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:19,320
- I am like your brother! Please sir!
- Shut up! What is your problem?

128
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,160
Give me some time
I am here only! I'll manage it!

129
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,492
It's ok sir! I came here to bring him

130
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,162
Give me one week time

- Ten days sir! 10 days -After

00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,338
You can do whatever you want
Please sir

134
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,518
Thank you brother!

135
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,847
Visit my town once!

136
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,924
Sorry old man! I lied to that rowdy
that I am your grandson...

137
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,363
...because I couldn't bear
you getting blows...

138
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,394
Aren't you film actor Padma Rao?

139
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,767
- My life got liberated after
seeing you! -What is this?

140
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,537
I am your fan sir! Oh gosh!

Deasodhaarakudu. Devatha(Goddess)

142
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,878
Oh god! I've watched all
the films in the Television!

143
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:21,890
What is this sir! I thought you would be
at Jubli hills in a bungalow with cars!

144
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,891
Why are you in this house?
What is the quarrel?

145
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,397
Those were long time back!

146
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:35,736
I have lost all money because of
luxurious life, habits and donations!

147
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,575
In the end my own children...

148
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:43,574
...bluffed and looted my money!

149
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,907
Great man N.T.R, I don't know
in which world he is in now,

150
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:54,747
After he became Chief Minister,
he searched for me and give this house to me

151
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,926
My desire is to give this house
to orphans like me..

152
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:05,591
...The persons who do not have shelters

153
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:10,600
Orphanage! But, while seeing the situation..

154
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,943
..L am scared that I'll lose the house!

155
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:21,111
You don't be afraid grandpa!
I am from Rayalaseema!

156
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,785
We can play cricket with bombs!
They are just kids to me!

157
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:30,859
Until this problem comes to an end,
I'll stay here and I'll see their end!

158
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,454
Shall I stay here, grandpa?

159
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,288
Are you trying to stay here permanently
with the name of relationship?

160
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,461
How can I do comedy with you, grandpa?
The actual matter is...

161
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,366
I came here to become a
comedian in cinema field!

162
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,170
If I stay here, I can learn some dialogues,
I'll do some service to you...

163
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,369
...and also I can see the
end of those rowdies!

164
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,378
I'll pay rent grandpa!
Shall I keep my bag in that room?

165
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:57,309
Ok, Do it!
Actually, what is your name?

166
00:17:58,844 --> 00:17:59,652
Chakram, grandpa!

167
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,526
What? Wasn't he found in Chennai,
Salem and some other places?

168
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,831
Make merry!

169
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,868
My name is Chakram! Are you
the washer man in this colony?

170
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,014
Do you want money?
ls Rs.1000 enough to you?

171
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:30,350
We don't have the time to love!
East! It'll go!

172
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,914
- What is this fire?
- Goddess got angry!

173
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,687
Not like that! I think you
could not do it properly!

174
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,920
Once in a day only!

175
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,959
Has your desire went in ruin?
You hit him well!

176
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,692
What will you become Padmarao?
- I am his grandson!

177
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:48,361
Why did you interfere in that quarrel?
Why can't you explain to him!

178
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,073
- That Yadav is very dangerous guy!
- He has done <i>2</i> or 3 murders!

179
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:56,202
Why are you talking like this?
Millions of people laughed at our grandpa!

180
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,871
Now he is in distress! It is your
fortune to have a man like him!

181
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,885
Will you leave if anyone is in distress?
You've a lot of people in a big colony!

182
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,714
What can that rowdy do
if you are together?

183
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,384
Excessive stupor is not good for health!

184
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,223
Do you have these type of
ideas about this colony?

185
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,395
Then, listen...

186
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,590
Buchi Babu who is living on that flat!

187
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,634
Well talk about the MP post
of Vijayawada Rajasekar!

188
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,066
- Do you know who is elected as a
candidate for that post? -For whom?

189
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,572
For me! I don't like politics
So I canvassed for him and he won

190
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,733
- Anyway he is my childhood friend!
- Oh gosh!

191
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,411
- Vijayakumar!
- What about Vijayakumar?

192
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,413
He asked IG promotion from DIG.
I did that with my influence!

193
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,414
- Do you know Shankaramoorthy?
- Who is he? -Don't you read newspapers?

194
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,745
He is Rajasthan's Chief Minister!

195
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,589
He asked transfer to AP!
I did that also

196
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,952
He is giving money on interest with
his dowry and he'll do unnecessary chats

197
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,425
He is like a dialogue king!

198
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,259
Hyderbad rowdies do not bother
about other's words! -Really

199
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,095
They are not scared about court,
case and police!

200
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,928
I am asking frankly! Why did that old
man haveing great affection with that house?

201
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,767
We don't know that
he'll die today or tomorrow!

202
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,106
I'll do the settlement with a good rate!
Tell him to give them!

203
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,775
Why are you fighting with rowdies?

204
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,942
Now No. <i>2</i>
Mr. and Mrs. Basavaraju!

205
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,779
Is this really a dish?

206
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,615
Can you only break this?
Can't I break it?

207
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,449
- Leave me! -I'll kill you!

208
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,785
Don't you have the respect
about your hubby! -I'll hit you!

209
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:21,796
Made for each other!

210
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,125
What are you saying?

211
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:27,328
Are you telling us to fight with those
rowdies for that old man who'll die soon?

212
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,527
Do you have sense?

213
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,799
Now, No.3
Nadipudi Narahari!

214
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,138
Not like that!

215
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:37,469
If it is a department, they would've some
percentage from the top to bottom!

216
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:42,307
- Yes! - Is it new? That is rule! It was
introduced from the day we got independence!

217
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,977
- Rs.60 Million contract! -Yes
- I am asking 10 percent commission!

218
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:50,820
You send Rs.0.5 million...
Send Rs.1 million! -Ok

219
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,495
- What do you say!
- Ok! -Bye!

220
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:56,165
What will you give if I visit your house,
what'll you bring if you visit mine?

221
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:01,668
What service can that old man provide
with that Old Age Palace? Tell me!

222
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,170
That house is looking like
a mark of evil eye!

223
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,843
Why are you fighting with rowdies!
It is nonsense!

224
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,342
At least you explain him!

225
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,508
They are not kids!
They are like thunders!

226
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,516
I don't want this education!

227
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,517
- I don't want this
- Don't play! Be quiet!

228
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,023
- Eat it!

229
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,360
We don't know when and whom
they will attack at anytime!

230
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,529
They can change this Hi-Tech city
as Jurassic Park!

231
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,194
“Oh gosh!
- Stop!

232
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,538
Then No.5

233
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,209
I am looking to launch a pub
with discothéque near Panjagutta

234
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,573
We'll get minimum Rs.50,000 per day!
I won't do other than that brother in law!

235
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,715
- I want Rs.3 million!
- Rs.30 Million?

236
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,044
Then, do you think we can go
to America with Rs.30?

237
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,710
What do you think?
Earning money is not very easy!

238
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,790
Don't talk nonsense dad!

239
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,222
If a cow grazes on the field,
can it calf graze out of the field?

240
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,228
They don't know what they are doing!
They are like apes!

241
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,397
- Our grandpa...
- Can't you understand it once?

242
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:04,226
- Do you think, fighting with Yadav
is like a comedy! -Not like that...

243
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,922
I think this petrol pipe is leaking!

244
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:43,937
Who is Lakshmi?

245
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:47,769
- That means... -Her father is like
Shoban Babu in old films...

246
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,106
...and Jagapathy Babu in new films!

247
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,110
He has two wives (Aayanaki lddharu)

248
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,681
- He'll drink brandy and whisky
in a same glass! -That means?

249
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:53,475
I can't understand your behavior, son!

250
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,780
- Having a daughter at marriageable age,
you're roaming with a concubine -Mom!

251
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:02,124
She is not a concubine!
Mind your words!

252
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,955
It's your wish
We won't speak anything!

253
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,455
But, we are finding hard
to control our Lakshmi!

254
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,800
- She discontinued her
education in medicine! -Why?

255
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,966
- Why did she stop her education in between?
- Don't know!

256
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,139
In this house all are
behaving as per their wish!

257
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,969
Mom! Keep quiet!

258
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:23,144
Take money for this month's expenses
and also her education expenses!

259
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:27,813
Come dear!

260
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,145
Why did you discontinue your college?

261
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,647
It's your ambition to become a doctor!

262
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,484
Three years are completed.
How many days do you left to finish it?

263
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,994
Listen to me

264
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,165
Who want your money?

265
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:47,804
Don't you have shame to roam
with a concubine at this age?

266
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,133
Are you trying to cleanse
your sins with money?

267
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,832
Do you think nobody is
here to question you?

268
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,936
Have you got self regard?

269
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,912
Is this concubine your wife?
ls my Mom your concubine?

270
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,180
- Shut up!
- Beldamel You shut up!

271
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,852
Stop!
All are watching us!

272
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,352
Let them watch!
All of them know about this fuss!

273
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:10,016
If you have responsibilities as a Dad,
leave her and stay with us!

274
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:14,263
Otherwise, it is disgusting
for you to visit...

275
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,556
...and give money monthly once

276
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,962
Don't you get any person
other than my dad?

277
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,435
- Wait! -I'll hit with slipper!
Get down from the car -Stop Lakshmi!

278
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,039
Get down!

279
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,715
- Is he your Dad?
- Disgusting!

280
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:36,045
Who is this sister?
Is she your Mom?

281
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:40,719
Then, who is this sister
Is she dummy for your Mummy?

282
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:46,191
That means,
does your dad have two wives?

283
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,889
All the men are like this only!
We should not believe them!

284
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,659
He won't prosper
He'll go to ruins

285
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,072
Do you know how raged you are?

286
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,871
It'll get a shock if I touch you!
That's great!

287
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,741
- Yamini, one time...
- Disgusting! -Once please..

288
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:10,682
- Get lost! -Only once!
- Why are you falling on like that? Go

289
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,755
- Get lost
- Don't you like me?

290
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:35,270
An actor must have
responsibility and dignity!

291
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:41,478
Lot of the people would feel happy
while seeing us on the stage and screen!

292
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,485
They'll laugh, cry, think and follow us!

293
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:51,958
That's why we should have respect
and responsibility about the society!

294
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,024
This whole world is like our family!

295
00:25:55,654 --> 00:26:02,799
<i>Whole world is my family!
But I lead a solitary life!</i>

296
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:11,641
<i>The familial life is mine
I am ecstatic and void too!</i>

297
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,317
It is superb, Grandpa!

298
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,953
- Teach this song completely to me!
- Sure, I'll teach you completely!

299
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:24,489
Dear! I am feeling sleepy!
Don't you? Sleep early dear!

300
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,186
I don't have time to sleep!

301
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:33,031
<i>Whole world is my family!
But I lead a solitary life</i>

302
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,335
- You got it right
- I am learning it!

303
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:40,172
Oh Lord Krishna and Vaasudeva!

304
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,705
She is not keeping water in the bedroom!

305
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,104
Oh gosh! Who are you?

306
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:21,015
Oh god!
Oh gosh!

307
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,882
Oh god!
Thief!

308
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,386
Thieves!

309
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,111
Have thieves entered into this colony
last night? In which house?

310
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,611
Illegal earnings (Nadamantrapu siri)
He lost(Hari) it!

311
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,314
It's pity!
Is it Narahari sir?

312
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,818
To discuss about that,
colony persons have arranged meeting!

313
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,988
They are going to arrange
a new security guard!

314
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,587
Dear brother and sisters!

315
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:04,592
Thieves have entered
into our colony for the third time!

316
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:09,255
We arranged this meeting to appoint
a new security guard because...

317
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:13,198
...our old security guard
has not done his duty properly!

318
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,170
He got that money thorough
illegal means. How can it live long?

319
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,468
It'll go in the way it came!
I knew this before!

320
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:22,841
Mind your words! You are doing
interest business with wife's dowry...

321
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,538
...Are you giving advice to others?

322
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:26,707
Why are you scolding my hubby!

323
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,443
My parents have the money,
so we are getting it!

324
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,647
- We are not poor! -We are also
not begging! By hard work, we are living

325
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,621
We don't know to earn money
in an illegal way!

326
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:38,551
Don't talk like this!
I know whom you are telling this!

327
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,494
- You be quiet! -Wait
- Go -shut up!

328
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,031
Here, this is not to discuss
about how we earn!

329
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,795
We'll appoint a new security guard

He is Chakram!
Padmarao's grandson!

- What energetic? Idiot!

I little bit over acted

It is wrong
I apologise!

00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,182
There must be a strong reason behind it!

00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,516
My worry is about my daughter Lakshmi!

She is really very angry!
She doesn't speak to anyone!

438
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,854
Because of this, this colony people are
speaking according to their imagination!

Why did Lakshmi fight with her father?

444
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:27,713
Not like that! Rajeshwari was
the main background of that incident!

445
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:29,010
She doesn't respect her husband!

446
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,986
My aunt's daughter saw Rajeshwari
with another person in Shanthi theatre!

Rajeshwari's illegal contact!

00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,704
- Who? -A person called Prabhakar,
working in a cinema field!

452
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,400
- He'll roam with suitcases!
- Is it! -Yes!

455
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,980
- They are talking about cheaply

456
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:11,752

461
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,002
Damn them!

462
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:33,604
Why are you getting angry?
ls there anyone like that here?

463
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,620
Oh gosh! It's ridiculous!
It is like that sister!

464
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:43,488
If we gossip about others,
others will do the same about us!

465
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:48,756
- If your husbands know about this...
- Oh god! -Oh god!

466
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,634
- She is not studying well!
- Shut up!

That's why she is going to special classes!
My daughter is working hard!

- My Dad advised before giving this Rs.200
- And your Dad?

472
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:18,154
- He acted smart but
did not give any money! -Wait!

473
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:24,931

00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,730
- We won't come there!
- Granny!

492
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,237
- Don't think about the past!
- Yes, Granny!

493
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,237
We are young people!
Without our knowledge, we'll do mistakes!

494
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,642
You are elders! You should forgive us
instead of punishing! Tell her!

495
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:46,907
Nothing will happen like that in future!
We'll stay together from today onwards!

496
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:48,948
Is it ok to you, Granny?
What do you say Raji?

497
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,985
Not about minding! I am very happy
because you visited my house!

498
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,953
I never thought that
we would unite like this!

499
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,485
Let's unite...Come!(Kalisundham Raa!)

500
00:41:56,814 --> 00:42:00,023
- Is this your play, Chap!
- It's because of your blessings, Granny!

501
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,496
- Nice guy!
- I feel happy!

502
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,258
Oh gosh!
Rowdy has arrived!

503
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,293
- We'll take leave!

504
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,166
- Goddess Varalakshmi. 
- Get lost! -Come quickly

505
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,432
You must attend the feast!

506
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:19,177
Where were you roaming
like a guy until now?

507
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,519
Why are you not answering
when mother in law questions you?

508
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,494
After quitting the education...

509
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:48,476
Oh gosh!

510
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,484
Shut up!

511
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,377
- What is your problem?
- Problem?

512
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,922
You are thinking like you only
have problems in this world...

513
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:06,825
..all of them laughing about you,
they are commenting you on your back etc

514
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:08,561
Because of this you are
behaving like psycho!

515
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,630
Who are you? After all a girl in
World's total population of 6000 millions!

516
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:17,069
Do you think they don't have
another work other than your issue?

517
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:18,706
You are not that famous!

518
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,503
You are not a kid!
Do you know one thing?

519
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,846
Yesterday is not ours!
It's gone!

520
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,842
Tomorrow is not for us!
We don't know what will happen

521
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,217
Today is in our hands!

522
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,750
Be happy and live happy!
That is not very hard!

523
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:42,226
Do you know another thing?
A smile can reverse hundreds of worries!

524
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:46,129
It will unite thousands of people!
For instance, smile once in front of mirror!

525
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:47,201
You can see the difference!

526
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,737
It is very easy to give a lecture!
Go and play with kids...

527
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:58,831
- It's me! Move aside!
- Why did he come this side?

528
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:02,343
Can factionists make girls to laugh?

529
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,443
How can factionists do comedy!

530
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:08,840
This was taught by Osama brother
in Afghanistan lairs!

531
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:12,943
- Osama Bin Laden?
- Yes!

532
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,086
Do you know from where the bombs
were supplied for that plane crash?

533
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:21,956
I have supplied it!
I was also tried to crash a flight!

534
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:25,631
- Because of my stomach pain!
- Stomach Pain!

535
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:31,970
- It's for me!
- Dawood brother! It is Ibrahim!

536
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,110
Oh God!

537
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:49,052
Lakshmi Smiled!
My stupor has come down!

538
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:16,851
Oh gosh!

539
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:22,522
It is Lakshmi!

540
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,017
Switch it off!

541
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:34,596
- We are very happy when
you smile! -Yes

542
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,704
You have talked to us
like this a year before!

543
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,741
- I tried a lot to say sorry!
But you never gave a chance! -Leave it!

544
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,707
- Anyway we are so lucky!
- For what?

545
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:45,244
- Today, Srinu's last birthday!
Why? Does he have AIDS?

546
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,915
No, he is going to America within a month!

547
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,951
That's why we've arranged for a
birthday party in a discotheque!

548
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:54,089
- You must attend it!
- Me to disco? No way!

549
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,415
- You should come! -Wait!
I will not cut the cake if you won't attend!

550
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:58,926
You may leave after he cuts the cake!

551
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:52,178
It's just a coke!
Nothing will happen. Drink!

552
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,750
- Wait Lakshmi!
- What happened?

553
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,588
- Leave aside! What happened
Lakshmi? -I'll go home!

554
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,286
Come I'll take drop you!

555
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,363
- Who are you to take her!
I'll drop you! -Wait!

556
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:20,367
I'll take her!
Come on!

557
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:31,708
- Who are you? -Wait. Come with me!
- Be quiet! -Leave her!

558
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:40,715
From Narsi town district, In Kottha koota
family, a boy belonging to nomads..

559
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:47,385
..Who came now is a doctor
His name is Ganga Raju!

560
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:55,267
<i>Ganga Raju speaks a lot!</i>

561
00:49:55,425 --> 00:50:01,376
<i>Ganga Raju told about mirror bungalow!</i>

562
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:07,141
<i>Ganga Raju said there is a well
in the middle of the house!</i>

563
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:12,811
<i>Ganga Raju says that hair is like a rope!</i>

564
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:17,976
<i>Ganga Raju said nobody can stop me!</i>

565
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:27,727
- How dare you hit me!
- Where is Lakshmi?

566
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:37,837
You remind of my dad!

567
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:39,171
Really!

568
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:47,487
My dad likes me a lot!

569
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:52,289
I also like my dad very much!

570
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,631
Guys will get temptation
while seeing charming girls like you!

571
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:03,461
They will try to impress you!

572
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,304
Before chide them,
don't you have sense?

573
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,906
Do you drink whatever
they give? Mad girl!

574
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:15,711
Meaning of smile is friendship!
It's not a meaning of innocent!

575
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:19,648
Your father is sending money for
your house expenses without your knowledge

576
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,050
Are you getting angry?
It's correct!

577
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:26,321
Then, how is your home running?
Food, clothes, rent... How?

578
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,660
Our angry will not feed food
for us and our people!

579
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:34,498
If you have a self-respect,
take care of them! Do any work!

580
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:40,664
You may ask what job will I get
from my discontinued doctor degree!

581
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:47,345
Do you know, there may be small
people in this world not the small jobs?

582
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:58,710
Volga

583
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:21,909
<i>Little hot and little warmth!</i>

584
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:27,047
<i>Little tough and little loving!</i>

585
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:33,050
<i>Let me offer you the nectar of my lips!</i>

586
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:40,891
<i>Let your hug arrest the time!
Become a whirlwind and embrace me!</i>

587
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:50,240
<i>You spread like snow
Turn into a fire to melt me!</i>

588
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:56,768
Volga

589
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:36,952
<i>If I close the door
will my thoughts bout you stop?</i>

590
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:41,956
<i>If you are in my mind,
how can I continue bathing?</i>

591
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:47,129
<i>Your toxin has passed into my veins!</i>

592
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:52,467
<i>I can't control my emotions!</i>

593
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:57,805
<i>Even it is an allegation
it gives me pleasure!</i>

594
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:02,472
<i>Let me explain my feelings to you!</i>

595
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:09,341
Volga

596
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:57,695
<i>You reminded me that I am a girl!
but learnt the secrets buried in mind!</i>

597
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:02,894
<i>When your ravishing air
explained me your deeds</i>

598
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:13,411
<i>I could hear the startled sound
and get the cupid's letter</i>

599
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:17,888
<i>At a time when youth is salacious</i>

600
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:23,915
Volga

601
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:13,113
Like this!

602
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,120
Oh gosh!

603
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:31,195
What? Is it a fighting scene?
Just a minute!

604
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:37,130
I'll do solo fight!

605
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,243
Monkey fight!

606
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:57,657
Rooster fight!

607
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:04,060
What is he doing? Does he have an
experience in fighting?

608
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,495
I don't know all these!

609
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:30,187
Don't worry
I am with you!

610
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:37,421
- Don't push me!
- Wait guys!

611
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:45,365
It is Yadav brother!

612
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:48,274
It's wrong dear!
Don't say like that!

613
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:50,968
You must study!
You should go college!

614
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,513
- Do you want a bike? I'll buy you
from Bombay -Please sir!

615
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,618
I wanted to talk to you!
Show pity to him! Give 10 days time!

616
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:01,278
We'll discuss about it!
10 days sir, please!

617
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:09,059
Brother, don't!
Please!

618
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,062
I'll talk to him brother!
Don't do it!

619
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,065
- Don't brother!
- Get lost!

620
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:18,933
Please brother, I'll talk to Yadav brother!
Leave it for once!

621
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,168
I said don't! Can't you understand?

622
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:52,602
I said no!
I am begging you!

623
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:56,270
I said no!
I am begging you!

624
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:28,265
Leave him!

625
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:32,539
I am telling for your sake!
Otherwise you'll get into trouble!

626
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:48,949
Brother, leave me!
Don't hit

627
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:52,886
Don't hit brother!

628
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:15,944
Is you age around at 45 to 50?

629
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:19,981
<i>You would have diseases like
blood pressure and diabetes!</i>

630
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:25,182
Because of smoke from your childhood,
your levers would've been damaged

631
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,591
Even an heart attack might
come today or tomorrow

632
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:31,195
You may have started boozing
from the age of 10 years!

633
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:33,426
Because of that your kidney
also would've been damaged

634
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:37,264
Eating health hazard foods in boozing,
your stomach will burst!

635
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:45,677
Throat cancer due to consumption
of chewing products in large amount...

636
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:50,774
You may live at least
for 5 to 10 years with diseases

637
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:52,945
Why all these trouble?

638
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:57,086
What will you earn
by torturing these people?

639
01:01:57,213 --> 01:02:00,285
Will you enjoy with
this kind of money?

640
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:01,953
You will say it's for your son

641
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,559
Without knowing how you earned
this money your son...

642
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,031
..will addict to bad habits and will take
the drugs throughout the night...

643
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,295
..while enjoying the disco with boozing
In a hurry of coming to home...

644
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:15,100
..in the bike which you bought for him...

645
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:19,643
..he'll drive in an inebriated condition
at top speed in between 100 and 200..

646
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,511
..And will ram to a lorry in any road

647
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,318
No, no
It's enough

648
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:30,152
No, no

649
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:34,992
Don't tell me more!

650
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:48,334
- You have doubts about me,
isn't it? - Yes

651
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:51,011
Don't reveal to anyone

652
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:59,016
In fact, I am a brother in the jungle!

653
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,687
You mean you are a Naxalite?

654
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:08,688
To mingle with the purpose
of public service...

655
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:13,693
Brothers thought this colony is the
right place and have sent me here

656
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:18,695
Hail the red flag!

657
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:23,036
Service For Public

658
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:08,316
There may be small people
in this world not the small jobs

659
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:09,581
One friend had told me

660
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:16,889
I didn't think you will
take control of your life so fast

661
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:19,292
Each and every day
my liking over you is growing!

662
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:27,840
I don't like girls who are scared
and worried for trivial issues

663
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:31,611
They should be like you
like a firebrand, daring, independent

664
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,781
That's why I like Indira Gandhi,
Kiran Bedi, Mother Teresa...

665
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,851
..and Sahara colony Lakshmi

666
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:42,789
I like you very much

667
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:47,123
You are running out of time
for Pizza Delivery. Go

668
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:01,475
- Come inside
- Who is that?

669
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:05,141
Lakshmi come inside

670
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:07,007
Pizza has been ordered for this address

671
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,041
Do you work in the Pizza store?

672
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,752
Why do you work?
Am I not there to take care?

673
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,880
Will you take the Pizza
and pay the bill or not?

674
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,080
Let's not talk outside, come inside

675
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:20,660
Will you take the Pizza or not?

676
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:23,655
We didn't order

677
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:29,996
Are you scared?

678
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:32,729
Will you take the Pizza
and pay the bill or not?

679
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,735
I ordered the Pizza for this address

680
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,173
- Is it you?
- Yes

681
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:46,347
What is the problem
you had with your father?

682
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:50,681
Because he is living with
some other person, isn't it?

683
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,690
Your father looked after you
very well until yesterday...

684
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:56,522
Hae you ever thought under
what circumstances he lives there?

685
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:58,666
After bearing all your humiliations..

686
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,927
Why does he come
to see you repeatedly?

687
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,433
Why is he doing this?...

688
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:05,266
Because he didn't
forget the duty of a father

689
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:09,103
He could have covered up his
relationship if he had desired

690
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:10,039
But he didn't

691
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:13,371
There is no use in pinpointing
the mistakes to anyone

692
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,344
Everyone will lose the peace

693
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:24,153
Look, Life is not easy
for anyone at anytime

694
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,553
We should adjust to each and every place!

695
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,227
We can't avoid that

696
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:33,960
After 10 years, there is no use in you
and your mom parting from your father

697
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:36,830
Because it will be too late!

698
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,438
If you want to solve your problem...

699
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:42,803
Take the right decision at the right time

700
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:46,910
I know how it feels
by separating from the father

701
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:51,578
I just wanted to say my opinion
Then it's your wish and their fortune

702
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,056
Prises went high for all!

703
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:03,922
Father please

704
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,092
I am sorry father

705
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:24,609
Mother is waiting

706
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:29,951
Shall we go to home?

707
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:43,703
I made them to search entire Tamil Nadu
and Bangalore! But, Chakram was not found!

708
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,030
Remaining is Hyderabad only!

709
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:46,772
Bribe! It is wrong dear!
You should say it as percentage!

710
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:51,269
I have to oblige
everybody in the department

711
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:58,811
Listen! First you send the advance
I will take care of everything

712
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,484
Brothers have started a battle
against corrupt officers!

713
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:06,319
Brothers has cut down
an officer's left leg and right hand...

714
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:09,655

near agency office

715
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:13,265
Brothers has cut down a throat
of a corrupt forest officer...

716
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:15,835
..and hanged him into a
banyan tree in front of public! -Oh gosh!

717
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:20,336
Brothers are showing interest in
Hyderabad's corrupt officers...

718
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:22,839
...Name and details of it!

719
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:30,510
- What did you say your
name is? -I forgot it!

720
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:34,347
I remember it!

721
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:37,183
Red flag Hail!

722
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:44,526
Percentage? It may be a percentage
or bribe, it is wrong!

723
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:48,358
Government is giving salary
for doing our duty!

724
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:51,865
You apply the tender in a legal way

725
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:55,633
Right person will get
the tender as per the rule!

726
01:08:56,465 --> 01:09:02,541
Don't call me now onwards
with this reason! Bye!

727
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:06,485
- I'll snip this Nuptial thread!
- You need not to do that, I'll do it myself!

728
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:08,714
- Aren't you scared about the husband?
- Don't you respect your wife?

729
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:20,067
I feel very hungry!
I didn't eat last night!

730
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,231
I came here because
your cooking is good!

731
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:26,729
A couple are fighting
from the day they get married!

732
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:31,740
There!
Brothers have warned them twice!

733
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:32,909
But they disobeyed that!

734
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:36,416
They made a call to me
from the forest at midnight!

735
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:40,911
They told me to cut down their hands!
I have done it!

736
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:42,085
Do you have Sambar (Indian sauce)?

737
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:47,917
<i>If couple of hearts gets together,
If couple of lives gets together!</i>

738
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:55,126
<i>If anybody give accompany,
that is a fortune and a Paradise!</i>

739
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:59,933
<i>Oh rainbow!</i>

740
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:02,939
Oh gosh! I can also compose
some good numbers!

741
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:06,173
What is your problem?

742
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:09,114
Last night Police has arrested
our Team Commander in an operation!

743
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:14,618
I knew that last night!
Home minister made a call and told me!

744
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:17,288
- Now, what is your situation?
- I am scared!

745
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,121
I wan it! Do you know IG
DIG, Chief Justice?

746
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:25,626
That's why we planned to
kidnap your daughter.

747
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:29,563
...In an exchange scheme
of our Team Commander's release!

748
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:32,366
Damn your plan! Who told them
to kidnap my daughter?

749
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:33,905
- It's me!
- Why?

750
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:37,307
You only said to me! You know
IG, DIG and Chief Justice!

751
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:38,468
Make a call to them urgently!

752
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:40,476
How can I know them?
I don't know anyone!

753
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:41,980
You said that you knew them!

754
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:44,151
It's a lie!

755
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:47,654
Because of my bad time,
I have created a fib in this colony!

756
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:52,088
Your daughter's life is in danger
because of your fibs!

757
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:55,651
She is an innocent girl!
Tell them not to harm her!

758
01:10:57,353 --> 01:11:03,326
- You should not speak lie at anytime,
anywhere, any place! - I should not!

759
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:04,333
Really!

760
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:19,345
What is this?

761
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:23,884
- I'll say! This is a newly released five,
...ten rupees coin! -No

762
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,688
I'll say! It is the pigment
in cheek of a bride!

763
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:29,523
- I also! It is a small hole
in my Dad's head -No -Stupid!

764
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:31,826
- It is a button of Narahari
sir's Pant! -No

765
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:35,357
- It is a shit of a crow on
the beach! -Shut up!

766
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:36,868
- I'll say correctly.
- Tell!

767
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:41,201
It is a planet of Mars
which came near the earth! -No

768
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,707
- It's like my nuptial thread!
- No -I'll tell you

769
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:45,901
- It is the hip of Aishwarya Roy!
- I'll kill you -Me!

770
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:47,708
- It is a hole in ozone
- No

771
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:50,543
I'll tell you. It is a mole
of Simran's high lip!

772
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:53,549
- I'll say correctly! Is it a
last zero of Rs.100 note? -No

773
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,053
- I'll say
- What will you say?

774
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:58,522
It is a last drop (Chukka) of a drink!
- Your stupor(Kicka) went high!

775
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,991
Catch him!
He is out!

776
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:03,059
Can't anyone see this as a white paper?

777
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:11,898
All are watching the dot in this but
no one is watching it as a white paper!

778
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:18,570
If we consider as a human's character,
then the dot is like a little bit of bad!

779
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:22,579
We are watching the dot, but we are not
seeing the whiteness around the paper!

780
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:25,909
We can also having the qualities
what we don't like from others!

781
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:29,085
We can see if we think ourselﬂ

782
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:31,584
No one is perfect!

783
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:37,924
We are unable to unite because
we are watching the bad things on others!

784
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:41,101
You are all living a
lonely life in this colony!

785
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:44,100
You should all unite and live
with affection and friendship!

786
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:46,102
That's why we are celebrating
a festival day in our colony!

787
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:48,269

01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:52,845
<i>Number nine would not cross the threshold!</i>

824
01:16:53,041 --> 01:17:00,516
<i>If you keep on adding numerals to it
it would become infinite!</i>

825
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:05,858
<i>If you and me want to remain unchanged ..</i>

826
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:09,695
<i>We can be one among the millions!</i>

827
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:13,361
<i>If you and me consider both as 'us' ..</i>

828
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:23,074
<i>we would become
a populace of the humanity!</i>

829
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:28,483
Don't shout! I can't understand
whether is it going on left or right!

830
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:31,390
I'll beg plead!
Don't shout!

831
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,226
Why are you shouting with kids?

832
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:40,231
The car looks good!

833
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:47,064
I want to drive this car
with my mom...

834
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:50,071
...and wife until I die,
without meter charge!

835
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,909
That girl also looking beautiful!

836
01:17:56,438 --> 01:18:00,580
It will be good, if anybody say
like if you wins a lottery,

837
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:03,990
..the girl is free with lottery money!

838
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:34,116
Wait Chakram!

839
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:39,955
Chakram, wait!

840
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:48,126
Is Chakram in Hyderabad?

841
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:10,547
I am Pedda Reddy speaking!

842
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:12,881
I need your Hyderabad guest house urgently!

843
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:21,049
- Where? -Father in law! I have seen
Chakram in an auto. This is the Number

844
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:25,064
He ran away on seeing me.
He didn't even pay heed to my call!

845
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:27,223
Some kids and a girl were with him!

846
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:28,891
He didn't stop even when I called him!

847
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:36,572
Has he given a noon show tickets when
you had gone to a matinee show movie?

848
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:38,741
Wait!

849
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:42,908
You are buying a sari for her
and she is buying a sari for you!

850
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:44,742
I am losing my money!

851
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:46,576
It would be better
if you are not together!

852
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:49,914
I promising!
I'm not coming!

853
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:52,592
You are preparing mutton,
she is preparing chicken!

854
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:54,752
I am unable to eat...
I am not coming

855
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:57,754
My belly is increasing
It is disturbing when I drive the auto!

856
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:01,165
No, listen to me!
My money is exhausting!

857
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:03,769
I said I won't come!

858
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:08,604
Nothing, I am talking with customer
Give me the phone!

859
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:09,942
Where is Chakram (Wheel)?

860
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,778
One wheel in the front and two wheels
in the back! Which wheel do you want!

861
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:21,516
Hyderabad autos are like atom bomb!

862
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,618
Don't play with us!
Give me the phone!

863
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:53,152
<i>I have waited for you near the greens field!</i>

864
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:57,380
<i>I have waited for you near the greens field!</i>

865
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:01,818
<i>I have waited until the rooster noise!</i>

866
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:14,834
You fool!
Where are you going?

867
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:17,339
- I am going to my farm house!
- For what?

868
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,841
- For a party!
- With boy friends or girl friends?

869
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,673
My friends!
It means, two girl friends among them!

870
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:26,183
I want to go Mumbai!
Will you drop me?

871
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:29,355
- Yes I'll do!
- Do you have petrol in your car?

872
01:22:29,878 --> 01:22:32,188
I have a petrol card!
- Then, for your expenses?

873
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:34,686
I am have a credit card!
- Then start the car!

874
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:37,192
If I...

875
01:23:02,243 --> 01:23:03,551
We are coming!

876
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:08,058
Oh gosh! You're
looking so beautiful!

877
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:12,963
Even the film stars
can't shine in front of you!

878
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:13,896
Let's go!

879
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:19,235
This is your life's turning point!
Your can make your dreams come true!

880
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:23,076
We are getting scared!
We'll go to our home!

881
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:26,077
Why are you getting scared?
It'll be very fun!

882
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:31,043
He is a rich man! It's enough to give
company for one hour!

883
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:33,584
He'll give ten thousand each!
All for you!

884
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:36,756
You can buy whatever you want!
Is it ok?

885
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:40,585
He has a five star hotel in Singapore!
I am going next week!

886
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:44,097
You are also welcome!
Will you come?

887
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:04,109
Do you know what happened?
Cry for it!

888
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:08,944
You may be in a brothel house
had I not visited at the right time!

889
01:24:11,813 --> 01:24:17,286
There are a lot more valuable than money!
Like values, Standards..

890
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:21,790
We can't buy that with money!
We should not lose it for money!

891
01:24:21,923 --> 01:24:24,130
We ourselves are a great asset!

892
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:26,635
Study well!
Get good marks!

893
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:29,503
If you are ready to work hard today,
you will have lot of opportunities!

894
01:24:29,664 --> 01:24:33,635
Here and at abroad also! We can
achieve anything. We can earn more!!

895
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:47,183
Don't repeat this wrong again!
Study well!

896
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:56,161
Brother! Run!

897
01:24:56,624 --> 01:25:00,197
- Don't come! Run away!
- What happened?-Don't come

898
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:04,332
Lot of people are coming for you!
Run away!

899
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:22,024
- Wait!
- Let's call the police!

900
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:30,194
- Which area is this?
- It's Banjara Hills!

901
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:32,564
- Get down
- Don't make noise! Come

902
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:36,702
Just a minute!

903
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:40,041
Tell them it is Banjara hills...

904
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:42,372
Leave me!

905
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:58,561
That is...
Dad!

906
01:26:01,589 --> 01:26:04,729
What is this?

907
01:26:06,594 --> 01:26:08,073
I am asking you!
What is this?

908
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:14,068
Is it fair to walk out
without informing us?

909
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:17,072
I feel my head has cut down!

910
01:26:18,106 --> 01:26:21,246
What wrong did we do?

911
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:27,915
You doesn't love your Dad!
It's ok!

912
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:31,923
But, do you remember
at least your Mom?

913
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:34,628
She is crying because of you?

914
01:26:36,124 --> 01:26:38,434
I am scared that she may die!

915
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:40,936
Let's go home!

916
01:26:41,129 --> 01:26:42,938
Are you trying to do marriage
with the name of mother?

917
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:45,441
I won't come!
I don't like this marriage!

918
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:52,443
Don't you like this marriage?
Come!

919
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:56,953
Answer to her!

920
01:26:57,078 --> 01:26:58,614
Why did you cheat her?
Tell that to her

921
01:26:58,746 --> 01:27:01,886
You made her believe, loved her,
promised to marry her...

922
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:04,293
...don't you feel ashamed to run off
at the marriage hour

923
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:09,133
You are not bothered about your parents

924
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:10,803
You need not reply to us

925
01:27:10,992 --> 01:27:13,336
But, you should answer to her
Tell

926
01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:17,298
- I don't like this marriage -That's what
I am asking, why? -Wait for a minute!

927
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:19,144
Ask him!

928
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:23,144
Did I make any mistake?

929
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,647
- You did not made any mistake
- Then, why?

930
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:29,147
Then, why have you go away?

931
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:33,319
I hate you!

932
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:36,662
You said I love you at that time!
Why do you hate now?

933
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,322
Suddenly, what happened?

934
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:41,832
On the time I said I love you,
did you ask why? No

935
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:43,664
Because you liked it!

936
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:46,102
But, now you are asking why
when I say I hate you!

937
01:27:46,194 --> 01:27:48,834
Because you doesn't like it!
Is it all your wish?

938
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:54,677
Love and hatred are feelings!

939
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:57,012
There will be no reasons for feelings!

940
01:27:58,706 --> 01:28:00,185
I don't like you

941
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:04,690
Turn this side and tell that you hate me!

942
01:28:06,381 --> 01:28:11,694
Ok. I am telling this by watching you!
I don't like you!

943
01:28:14,722 --> 01:28:15,530
Is it enough?

944
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:17,934
Wait!

945
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:21,036
Leave me

946
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:26,541
Wait!

947
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:30,545
Catch him!

948
01:28:35,743 --> 01:28:38,053
Be calm! I'll speak with him!

949
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:40,889
Leave me!

950
01:28:43,084 --> 01:28:44,620
What is this nuisance?

951
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:47,562
Because you have kidnapped Chakram!

952
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:49,399
That is.. you've brought him here

953
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:54,073
Are you mad?
Do you know who I am?

954
01:28:56,197 --> 01:28:57,904
- Do you know the relation
between us? -Inspector sir!

955
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:02,577
No one has kidnapped me!
I am safe. Watch it!

956
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:06,641
He is well know to me!
I came on my own because of some work!

957
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,912
It looks my people have
troubled you unnecessarily!

958
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:13,080
Leave the way
Nothing has happened

959
01:29:13,214 --> 01:29:16,093
I am fine. I am ok!
Don't be scared

960
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:20,099
- What happened

961
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:25,432

He is well know person to me
I came here to speak with him

963
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:30,673
Will you call police for that?
ls there any meaning for it?

964
01:29:30,732 --> 01:29:34,270
Let's go! Granny, Is it you?

We are earning a lot!
Next..

993
01:37:04,218 --> 01:37:06,391
Both our Dads will conduct our marriage

994
01:37:06,587 --> 01:37:11,559
Next, we'll beget kids
May be we'll make them as good doctors

995
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:15,739
Then, we'll do marriage for them
Then, we will get retirement

996
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:19,742
Then, a good farm house,
lake view, with 10 workers.

997
01:37:21,936 --> 01:37:26,749
Then, we'll die!

998
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:30,585
Will life end like that?
I want something more

999
01:37:30,878 --> 01:37:34,416
Our money, education and our
knowledge should be useful to others

1000
01:37:34,615 --> 01:37:37,494
For us, our well wishers,
our state and our nation!

1001
01:37:37,952 --> 01:37:43,766
I want to build a big
super specialty hospital in India!

1002
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:46,438
We'll import the best equipments
for that hospital!

1003
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:50,604
We'll ask our friends and
world's best doctors..

1004
01:37:51,131 --> 01:37:53,441
...To do service for one
or two months in a year!

1005
01:37:53,801 --> 01:37:58,181
We'll give a best medical service
for all in our area!

1006
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:03,286
After five years,
there would be no one like patient!

1007
01:38:05,479 --> 01:38:06,617
Will you come with me?

1008
01:39:09,977 --> 01:39:11,183
- Uncle
- Son in law

1009
01:39:13,213 --> 01:39:14,123
Are you fine?
- Are you fine?

1010
01:39:14,214 --> 01:39:15,022
- Fine
- Fine

1011
01:39:15,215 --> 01:39:16,193
Dad!

1012
01:39:17,384 --> 01:39:18,362
Mother!

1013
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:23,658
I was expecting a call since yesterday!
But you never called!

1014
01:39:23,724 --> 01:39:26,933
There won't be phone in the night
- Why, don't you have a cell phone?

1015
01:39:28,562 --> 01:39:32,100
Don't go away from me any more
I can't live without you

1016
01:39:32,166 --> 01:39:34,203
Ok don't cry, I won't go

1017
01:39:34,568 --> 01:39:36,707
Where is dad?
Oh gosh!

1018
01:39:37,905 --> 01:39:41,045
<i>Expected dawn...</i>

1019
01:39:43,243 --> 01:39:46,713
<i>If it encountered today..</i>

1020
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:49,556
Hadn't father changed yet?

1021
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:54,562
<i>While hidden heart jumps...</i>

1022
01:39:54,655 --> 01:40:00,230
<i>Why the dawn is not coming?
Why the mist is not going out?</i>

1023
01:40:00,928 --> 01:40:02,737
Oh my gold!

1024
01:40:05,866 --> 01:40:07,743
I will tell you in Telugu, father

1025
01:40:14,041 --> 01:40:15,418
What is this all aunty?

1026
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:18,421
- Isn't it only a monkey
will born to a monkey? - Aunty!

1027
01:40:19,446 --> 01:40:22,154
You have to live with
this monkey from tomorrow

1028
01:40:23,884 --> 01:40:25,591
You have shied enough
Let's go

1029
01:40:35,396 --> 01:40:36,602
Your towel had dropped
- Oh gosh!

1030
01:40:37,798 --> 01:40:38,606
It's cheating

1031
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:42,940
Leave him, he may die
Both of you're doing nuisance!

1032
01:40:46,306 --> 01:40:48,286
English for the aunty!

1033
01:40:48,742 --> 01:40:54,283
<i>Oh Gajuvaaka girl!
Are we not bangles seller?</i>

1034
01:40:59,553 --> 01:41:02,124
Don't you have the shame
While having a young son -For me

1035
01:41:02,222 --> 01:41:03,895
- Baby
- For me

1036
01:41:03,991 --> 01:41:05,971
There is no hurry for my son's marriage!

1037
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:07,639
I will again marry
two or three times and...

1038
01:41:08,495 --> 01:41:11,635
Isn't it enough killing me?
Will you still kill <i>2</i> or 3 persons?

1039
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:13,703
Why do you talk like that?

1040
01:41:13,834 --> 01:41:17,475
- What? -Uncle, I am going
out of the house..

1041
01:41:18,405 --> 01:41:20,146
..Including my daughter
Come

1042
01:41:20,507 --> 01:41:21,918
What happened?
- What happened brother?

1043
01:41:22,009 --> 01:41:24,819
Your husband is mad about
cinema now he is influencing it on him

1044
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:26,581
Even I may get infected

1045
01:41:29,616 --> 01:41:32,324
Not like that uncle,
Won't you get them married?

1046
01:41:32,419 --> 01:41:35,662
Uncle it's me who is going to marry

1047
01:41:37,624 --> 01:41:39,831
If you want me to marry your daughter...

1048
01:41:40,694 --> 01:41:42,332
- I need dowry
- Dowry!

1049
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:52,347
It is ours, for us,
for our people

1050
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:59,849
Our people no need to search and
worry for the treatment..

1051
01:42:00,147 --> 01:42:03,856
..And for money, foreign treatment
everything will be here

1052
01:42:04,384 --> 01:42:06,864
Totally free
I and Lakshmi have decided

1053
01:42:07,221 --> 01:42:08,529
We are not going to take a step back!

1054
01:42:08,722 --> 01:42:13,102
Our education, experience should
benefit our people and our nation

1055
01:42:14,895 --> 01:42:17,569
We have to spend more for this hospital

1056
01:42:18,398 --> 01:42:20,878
Both father and uncle...

1057
01:42:21,735 --> 01:42:25,842
Should give all their properties
That's the dowry I need

1058
01:42:27,541 --> 01:42:30,385
If you agree for this
we will get marry

1059
01:42:35,415 --> 01:42:36,894
You are like gold!

1060
01:42:44,558 --> 01:42:47,300
- Greetings Minister -Greetings!
Come -Be quiet man!

1061
01:42:47,594 --> 01:42:48,629
- Come
- Are you fine?

1062
01:42:48,762 --> 01:42:50,571
Chakram, are you an American Doctor?

1063
01:42:52,032 --> 01:42:52,908
She is Lakshmi
Are you fine?

1064
01:42:53,233 --> 01:42:54,405
- She is my daughter
- Let's go

1065
01:43:04,778 --> 01:43:06,416
The groom will reach
at the auspicious time

1066
01:43:07,948 --> 01:43:08,926
Oh gosh!

1067
01:43:14,154 --> 01:43:15,565
Dad, is this marriage
for you or me?

1068
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:16,793
- Mother -Not like that

1069
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:18,598
Oh god! What is this crazy work?

1070
01:43:18,792 --> 01:43:19,770
I am groom's assistant!

1071
01:43:20,294 --> 01:43:23,036
- What assistant? Tell him
- Does it look good?

1072
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:24,768
- Everybody is laughing
- Laughing!

1073
01:43:27,634 --> 01:43:30,274
Mr.Chowdary!You get ready!
Come Oh, today is my marriage!

1074
01:43:32,139 --> 01:43:34,278
Haven't you got ready yet?
This side

1075
01:43:34,474 --> 01:43:36,283
Oh god! I don't know
to wear groom's dress!

1076
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:40,056
Bring the groom soon

1077
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:42,285
He is not opening the door

1078
01:43:45,319 --> 01:43:48,459
Chakram open the door

1079
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:51,462
Son is not there

1080
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:53,865
I don't like this marriage
don't try to search for me

1081
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:11,482
Sahara colony?

1082
01:44:11,845 --> 01:44:13,188
Why have they come for Chakram?

1083
01:44:13,347 --> 01:44:16,226
What is the connection between
Chakram and them? I need all the details

1084
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:17,690
Is it Sahara colony?

1085
01:44:18,452 --> 01:44:19,658
What is all this?

1086
01:44:20,354 --> 01:44:21,731
- Who are they?
- Grand father they are...

1087
01:44:21,788 --> 01:44:24,166
Who are that villains blew me like this?
- They are not villains!

1088
01:44:24,324 --> 01:44:26,998
- Why did they tried to kidnap you?
- Why did they hit you

1089
01:44:27,194 --> 01:44:28,969
What happened inside?
What did they do to you?

1090
01:44:29,062 --> 01:44:31,235
Who is that lady and why is she crying?

1091
01:44:31,331 --> 01:44:34,676
Why did you prevent them
from being questioned by the police?

1092
01:44:34,868 --> 01:44:36,506
What is your relationship with them?

1093
01:44:36,603 --> 01:44:40,278
Oh gosh! So many questions?
I will answer it all one by one

1094
01:44:40,374 --> 01:44:42,854
- Then who is he?
- Kandhula Pedha Reddy!

1095
01:44:43,043 --> 01:44:45,216
Cuddapah, 200 crore properties

1096
01:44:45,345 --> 01:44:47,120
A big factionist!

1097
01:44:49,583 --> 01:44:51,654
- He is my father
- Your father!

1098
01:44:51,752 --> 01:44:53,698
I am his only son

1099
01:44:54,554 --> 01:44:57,194
Is he your father?
Then why did he kidnap you?

1100
01:44:57,324 --> 01:44:59,770
It is because of movie craze!

1101
01:44:59,893 --> 01:45:02,806
To become a big comedian,
I have told you know...

1102
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:04,203
He doesn't like movies!

1103
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:06,676
Want to do the fashion
lfl did the fashion...

1104
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:10,107
There will be awards,
cutouts, whistles, autographs

1105
01:45:10,237 --> 01:45:13,548
Flower pouring, milk pouring, isn't it?

1106
01:45:13,707 --> 01:45:15,084
That's why I escaped from the house

1107
01:45:15,242 --> 01:45:18,621
But he came here too
It's my fate!

1108
01:45:18,745 --> 01:45:19,746
Then who is that girl?

1109
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:23,220
You won't give up that,
she is my uncle's daughter

1110
01:45:23,684 --> 01:45:26,563
Sister in law!
She is troubling me to marry her

1111
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:32,836
lfl get married my female fans
will get upset that's why I escaped

1112
01:45:32,959 --> 01:45:35,667
- That's it!
- Then what

1113
01:45:35,796 --> 01:45:40,506
Do you think I will enact a comedy
like Samara Simha Reddy and Indra?

1114
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:45,081
You are all spoiled by watching
the cinema, go and mind your business

1115
01:45:45,272 --> 01:45:46,751
I feel asleep

1116
01:45:48,809 --> 01:45:52,086
Come let's go

1117
01:45:53,146 --> 01:45:56,753
- Oh gosh! -Get treated
by the doctor -It's ok

1118
01:46:09,496 --> 01:46:10,941
Forgive me grand father

1119
01:46:11,131 --> 01:46:15,602
I am leaving without completing
the work of your orphanage, again

1120
01:46:41,495 --> 01:46:42,473
escape!

1121
01:46:59,846 --> 01:47:04,192
Thief, thief!
- Thief, thief!

1122
01:47:05,018 --> 01:47:05,826
Who are they?

1123
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:18,839
Hey stop!

1124
01:47:19,533 --> 01:47:21,513
Hit him!
How can you escape from here?

1125
01:47:24,204 --> 01:47:25,683
Hit him!

1126
01:47:26,373 --> 01:47:28,683
Someone call the police
- Stop!

1127
01:47:31,711 --> 01:47:34,885
Let us first see their face
removing the mask before hitting

1128
01:47:35,882 --> 01:47:39,022
He said correct! Remove it!

1129
01:47:42,889 --> 01:47:43,867
Are you the thieves?

1130
01:47:44,057 --> 01:47:48,528
- Scoundrel! You told me
about America. Is this your work?

1131
01:47:48,662 --> 01:47:52,872
- How dare you?
- Wastrels - Stop!

1132
01:47:53,867 --> 01:47:56,370
Why do you hit them?
Mistake is yours

1133
01:47:58,738 --> 01:48:00,217
This age is very dangerous

1134
01:48:00,574 --> 01:48:03,714
They quickly get attracted
even it may good or bad

1135
01:48:03,844 --> 01:48:07,053
That's why your parents should take
the responsibility for your children!

1136
01:48:07,214 --> 01:48:09,888
You should guide them or else
they will end up like this

1137
01:48:14,421 --> 01:48:17,402
Don't bow your heads
Die by committing suicide

1138
01:48:17,924 --> 01:48:19,232
Is this life?

1139
01:48:21,761 --> 01:48:25,732
Our parents dream about
our future with expectations

1140
01:48:26,433 --> 01:48:29,243
They feel anxious about
our future when we grow

1141
01:48:29,769 --> 01:48:33,080
We shouldn't make them
feel agonized for giving us birth

1142
01:48:34,441 --> 01:48:38,912
People should not pinpoint
on us but salute us

1143
01:48:40,947 --> 01:48:44,087
Life is beautiful
Don't make it ugly

1144
01:48:44,784 --> 01:48:46,092
Try to know it's value!

1145
01:48:49,456 --> 01:48:52,437
Forgive me
Not for me for your parents

1146
01:48:52,626 --> 01:48:54,765
- Forgive me
- Get up!

1147
01:48:56,129 --> 01:48:57,608
We did a mistake

1148
01:48:58,798 --> 01:49:00,937
It's too late now, good night

1149
01:49:01,134 --> 01:49:06,277
Go home. Good night
uncle -Let's go

1150
01:49:06,806 --> 01:49:07,784
Good night

1151
01:49:11,478 --> 01:49:12,957
Go! Go!

1152
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:16,120
Go dear!

1153
01:49:33,333 --> 01:49:35,313
You have solved so many people's problems

1154
01:49:35,435 --> 01:49:37,813
- Why don't you solve my
problem too? -What you want?

1155
01:49:37,971 --> 01:49:39,973
- I need money -What for?
- For liquor

1156
01:49:40,106 --> 01:49:41,642
Don't you have the
concern other than liquor?

1157
01:49:41,741 --> 01:49:43,311
I use it for liquor for
whatever purpose you give

1158
01:49:44,177 --> 01:49:46,657
Liquor king!, Liquor gold! There it is!

1159
01:49:48,582 --> 01:49:50,152
You gave the bottle
I thought you'll give the money

1160
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:53,490
- Just a minute -What? Do you
know what is being prepared?

1161
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:55,657
- Do you know?- I know
Then tell me soon

1162
01:49:55,789 --> 01:49:59,327
Grapes, Orange, Apple,
little bit of fruit peels!

1163
01:49:59,693 --> 01:50:00,728
By mixing all these..

1164
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:04,000
They keep everything in the underground
in a pot until it become rot..

1165
01:50:04,531 --> 01:50:08,001
After we keep, flies, mosquitoes,
worms will jump on to this...

1166
01:50:08,101 --> 01:50:10,843
After they finish their daily activities.

1167
01:50:11,871 --> 01:50:15,580
It comes into a decay position after
they will do bath and family and die!

1168
01:50:15,709 --> 01:50:16,687
You mean in this- Yes

1169
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:20,849
Then they take it out and put in the
bottle like this, to make money

1170
01:50:21,648 --> 01:50:24,390
If we drink it before it become rot,
it is Juice and it is good for health!

1171
01:50:24,651 --> 01:50:28,360
If you drink after it becomes rot,
your body will also go rot! Now you drink

1172
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:32,766
Was I drinking this rot
all these days?

1173
01:50:32,892 --> 01:50:34,371
I won't drink it in my life any more

1174
01:50:41,501 --> 01:50:44,880
Everybody in our colony
admire you as a good security guard

1175
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:49,880
Only if you were perfect there
won't be theft in our colony

1176
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:52,048
Think it once

1177
01:51:26,613 --> 01:51:28,752
Are you escaping again?
Where?

1178
01:51:30,283 --> 01:51:32,593
- Father -Why?
Tell me

1179
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:35,930
Deserting me, your mother and Lakshmi

1180
01:51:36,756 --> 01:51:38,258
I am unable to understand

1181
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:42,271
- Swear on me and Mom...
- Father!

1182
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:46,941
Swear on me and Mom's life!

1183
01:51:47,967 --> 01:51:48,945
Tell me the truth

1184
01:51:53,306 --> 01:51:58,278
I will die

1185
01:51:59,145 --> 01:52:03,116
Father I will die

1186
01:52:07,487 --> 01:52:08,795
Father I will die

1187
01:52:58,304 --> 01:53:00,215
Listen to me carefully

1188
01:53:07,046 --> 01:53:12,553
I have done blood test because your blood
wasn't clotted on the day you got scratch!

1189
01:53:17,724 --> 01:53:19,203
It is an advance stage!

1190
01:53:19,526 --> 01:53:22,871
You can live a maximum
for <i>2</i> to 3 months

1191
01:54:00,433 --> 01:54:01,241
Open the door

1192
01:54:14,214 --> 01:54:16,592
I didn't know how to tell this

1193
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:19,260
And hesitated how you might take it

1194
01:54:19,786 --> 01:54:22,426
I was scared what would happen to
mom and Lakshmi if they hear it...

1195
01:54:22,922 --> 01:54:24,094
...That's why I escaped

1196
01:54:24,624 --> 01:54:25,967
I am escaping
Dad!

1197
01:54:32,632 --> 01:54:33,940
You were healthy!

1198
01:54:36,302 --> 01:54:37,110
Don't be scared
We'll go to America

1199
01:54:40,807 --> 01:54:43,947
I will save you
by selling all my properties

1200
01:54:44,978 --> 01:54:48,790
There are big doctors, isn't there?

1201
01:54:49,148 --> 01:54:51,128
I am also a doctor

1202
01:54:53,653 --> 01:54:54,996
There is no medicine for this

1203
01:54:56,489 --> 01:54:59,959
Your hundred crore rupees
can't save me even for a ten minutes.

1204
01:55:05,398 --> 01:55:10,472
Father!
Father!

1205
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:14,648
Father!

1206
01:55:21,848 --> 01:55:22,826
Father don't cry

1207
01:55:24,851 --> 01:55:26,694
Your cry prompting me also to cry

1208
01:55:28,688 --> 01:55:29,496
Oh gosh!

1209
01:55:32,191 --> 01:55:32,999
That's why

1210
01:55:34,527 --> 01:55:36,006
That's why I escaped without telling

1211
01:55:39,866 --> 01:55:41,174
Everybody will die

1212
01:55:42,201 --> 01:55:45,842
You will also die but
lam going little earlier

1213
01:55:56,049 --> 01:55:57,357
After I escaped from the marriage...

1214
01:55:58,051 --> 01:56:00,190
I am living in this colony

1215
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:02,426
Everyone here are good people

1216
01:56:02,555 --> 01:56:05,365
They are making hell
out of the small issues

1217
01:56:06,693 --> 01:56:09,537
Death is the biggest problem in the world

1218
01:56:10,229 --> 01:56:12,209
That is not a problem at all
when compared to death

1219
01:56:12,899 --> 01:56:14,378
I feel like laughing

1220
01:56:15,234 --> 01:56:18,704
I wanted to treat all the patients after
launching Super Specialty Hospital...

1221
01:56:19,238 --> 01:56:20,717
But I don't have that much time

1222
01:56:21,407 --> 01:56:23,546
They also have the sickness,
but it is psychological

1223
01:56:23,676 --> 01:56:25,053
That's why I started the treatment

1224
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:29,549
I will make at least
some people smile before I die

1225
01:56:32,251 --> 01:56:35,232
Only you gave me
this smile, this is yours

1226
01:56:36,089 --> 01:56:39,229
Why are you crying?
This doesn't suit you

1227
01:56:43,429 --> 01:56:45,238
I am not going anywhere

1228
01:56:46,265 --> 01:56:48,245
I will be born to you again and again

1229
01:56:48,701 --> 01:56:52,114
I won't leave you
Be courageous

1230
01:56:53,272 --> 01:56:55,582
You should look after
mother and Lakshmi

1231
01:56:57,944 --> 01:57:01,585
Lakshmi should forget me

1232
01:57:02,448 --> 01:57:03,927
She should get marry again

1233
01:57:04,417 --> 01:57:06,419
You should conduct her
marriage by supervising yourself

1234
01:57:07,954 --> 01:57:11,265
Lakshmi shouldn't know
about my death ever

1235
01:58:21,194 --> 01:58:22,673
You came to know everything, right?

1236
01:59:19,085 --> 01:59:19,893
What happened uncle?

1237
02:00:46,872 --> 02:00:51,872
Volga

1238
02:01:14,867 --> 02:01:19,009
<i>Sony cell phone pizza!
To your heart, give me a visa!</i>

1239
02:01:19,205 --> 02:01:23,517
<i>I saw sonic ﬂights speed in you!</i>

1240
02:01:23,709 --> 02:01:27,851
<i>Focus on me, like a love virus!</i>

1241
02:01:28,047 --> 02:01:32,018
<i>Shall I embrace you like a golden wire?</i>

1242
02:01:32,551 --> 02:01:36,522
<i>Oh Mona Lisa!
I'll slit your heart with my smile!</i>

1243
02:01:36,889 --> 02:01:40,860
<i>Oh Oasis! I'll hijack your heart!</i>

1244
02:01:42,428 --> 02:01:47,428
Volga

1245
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:31,582
<i>Your Paris style charm
spreads on me like a virus</i>

1246
02:02:31,777 --> 02:02:35,748
<i>...My dreams will go
nonstop like a Qualis car</i>

1247
02:02:36,115 --> 02:02:40,257
<i>My youth frothed like champagne
My mind became stormy!</i>

1248
02:02:40,453 --> 02:02:44,595
<i>My heart played rhythms to welcome you!</i>

1249
02:02:46,959 --> 02:02:49,439
<i>Shall I come like a rocket?</i>

1250
02:02:51,464 --> 02:02:53,603
<i>Once I become like Venus planet.</i>

1251
02:02:53,766 --> 02:02:57,942
<i>Oh living platinum!
Will you give me a kiss?</i>

1252
02:02:58,137 --> 02:03:02,279
<i>I'll become an ATM to give kisses!</i>

1253
02:03:02,475 --> 02:03:06,617
<i>- Wiil you give me a kiss?
- When I become one!</i>

1254
02:03:06,812 --> 02:03:08,792
<i>Will you give me a kiss?</i>

1255
02:03:10,015 --> 02:03:15,015
Volga

1256
02:03:57,363 --> 02:04:01,505
<i>Your bod glitters like Melbouen
joine me like a Kohinoor Diamond,</i>

1257
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:05,512
<i>I'll battle outwith your charm
like Bin Laden!</i>

1258
02:04:06,205 --> 02:04:10,347
<i>When your acid glances touch me
It's very sweet like a fruit salad!</i>

1259
02:04:10,543 --> 02:04:14,184
<i>Kill me with love!</i>

1260
02:04:17,049 --> 02:04:23,557
<i>Your hip is a nylon swing!
If you swing, it'll fire me!</i>

1261
02:04:23,722 --> 02:04:27,693
<i>I'll come like a dream on your eyes!</i>

1262
02:04:27,927 --> 02:04:32,205
<i>I'll make all the dreams come true!</i>

1263
02:04:32,398 --> 02:04:36,369
<i>- I'll come like a dream!
- I'll will make it true!</i>

1264
02:04:36,735 --> 02:04:38,715
<i>I'll come like a dream!</i>

1265

Volga

1266
02:05:23,449 --> 02:05:26,953
Father

1267
02:05:28,621 --> 02:05:29,929
Pay obeisance to him

1268
02:05:30,623 --> 02:05:31,431
Get up

1269
02:05:36,795 --> 02:05:38,968
You have created problems
for the marriage, right?

1270
02:05:39,298 --> 02:05:40,936
She is the girl
whom I am going to marry

1271
02:05:41,233 --> 02:05:45,272
Where is Lakshmi?
I just wanted to show her

1272
02:05:45,471 --> 02:05:46,779
Make arrangements for the marriage

1273
02:05:48,807 --> 02:05:52,448
Oh Lakshmi! My old darling

1274
02:05:53,979 --> 02:05:55,356
Her name is also Lakshmi

1275
02:05:56,815 --> 02:05:59,955
My new darling
I like her very much

1276
02:06:00,486 --> 02:06:03,126
I will marry her
Does she look good?

1277
02:06:04,990 --> 02:06:08,130
Oh gosh! I am scared
She might kill in the rage

1278
02:06:12,831 --> 02:06:13,639
O

1279
02:06:13,999 --> 02:06:17,742
I had once loved you
out of stupidity and innocence

1280
02:06:17,937 --> 02:06:21,475
Now I give up
I too feel sad

1281
02:06:22,007 --> 02:06:25,147
Let's do one thing
I like this girl very much

1282
02:06:25,844 --> 02:06:28,984
I will marry her
But I won't be unfair to you

1283
02:06:29,682 --> 02:06:31,161
Weekly once

1284
02:06:33,352 --> 02:06:35,161
-ls Sunday ok
- Ok

1285
02:06:35,688 --> 02:06:36,826
I will keep you
As a concubine!

1286
02:06:45,698 --> 02:06:50,169
I can understand your position
You won't get anyone other than me

1287
02:06:50,703 --> 02:06:53,343
You are unable to keep
anyone other than me

1288
02:07:02,414 --> 02:07:04,394
I am not bothered if you roam with her

1289
02:07:05,050 --> 02:07:07,189
I am not bothered if you marry her

1290
02:07:09,054 --> 02:07:11,364
I feel ashamed to have loved...

1291
02:07:12,558 --> 02:07:14,538
..a person like you

1292
02:07:43,422 --> 02:07:45,095
I need some forty lakh rupees

1293
02:07:46,258 --> 02:07:50,400
To construct an old age home for grandpa!
That is the only work I've to finish

1294
02:07:57,603 --> 02:08:00,914
Lakshmi, You only...

1295
02:08:06,278 --> 02:08:07,586
Are you going to London?

1296
02:08:10,616 --> 02:08:14,587
Yes uncle
I don't like to stay here

1297
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:16,121
I will go

1298
02:08:17,489 --> 02:08:18,763
Because of Chakram right?

1299
02:08:20,125 --> 02:08:21,263
Forget him

1300
02:08:22,461 --> 02:08:24,099
He is a Scoundrel

1301
02:08:25,464 --> 02:08:26,772
I will take care of you

1302
02:08:27,299 --> 02:08:29,279
I will look for a better man
than him... - No uncle

1303
02:08:30,135 --> 02:08:31,113
It's enough

1304
02:08:33,105 --> 02:08:36,609
Don't stop me
I will go

1305
02:08:43,315 --> 02:08:44,123
O

1306
02:08:45,317 --> 02:08:48,958
RAJ IV GANDHI AIRPORT

1307
02:08:51,156 --> 02:08:52,134
This is your passport

1308
02:08:55,994 --> 02:08:58,133
Forget the past
Take care of yourself

1309
02:08:59,498 --> 02:09:01,136
Call me if you need any help

1310
02:09:08,841 --> 02:09:09,979
I am sorry dear!

1311
02:09:18,350 --> 02:09:20,159
I can't understand what I do

1312
02:09:22,187 --> 02:09:23,666
It seems I am infected to bad deeds

1313
02:09:28,026 --> 02:09:31,337
I can't live without you
Don't desert me

1314
02:09:33,532 --> 02:09:38,532
Please dear!

1315
02:10:00,392 --> 02:10:03,202
Did you expected
me to crawl like this?

1316
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:09,572
I was thinking in the night

1317
02:10:10,235 --> 02:10:12,374
I felt sorry for you
I felt it was unfair

1318
02:10:12,571 --> 02:10:16,212
That's why a festival
fresh offer for you

1319
02:10:16,408 --> 02:10:20,584
Not two days in a week Friday
Saturday, Sunday three days for you

1320
02:10:21,580 --> 02:10:23,719
Uncle I will keep her in
a separate house after the marriage

1321
02:10:25,083 --> 02:10:28,394
I've made Lakshmi agree to this
Is it ok for you?

1322
02:10:28,754 --> 02:10:33,396
I did love you once
Weekly 3 days, is it ok?

1323
02:10:40,098 --> 02:10:42,078
Please don't lower yourself any more

1324
02:10:44,036 --> 02:10:46,073
I didn't think that
you are such a rogue

1325
02:10:47,940 --> 02:10:51,080
Did you think that I won't
get anyone else other than you?

1326
02:10:51,977 --> 02:10:53,251
Within ten days...

1327
02:10:54,112 --> 02:10:57,423
A boy handsome than you
More rich than you

1328
02:10:57,583 --> 02:11:00,757
More educated than you
a better boy than you

1329
02:11:00,953 --> 02:11:04,093
And who is ready to die for me
I will show you by marrying such a boy

1330
02:11:09,127 --> 02:11:10,105
Stay here

1331
02:11:10,929 --> 02:11:12,636
Don't run away once again like a coward

1332
02:11:12,798 --> 02:11:14,436
Be here if you have the courage

1333
02:11:16,602 --> 02:11:18,445
I will show you who am I

1334
02:11:24,142 --> 02:11:26,315
Do it to prove it

1335
02:11:26,645 --> 02:11:27,783
I will be here only

1336
02:11:30,816 --> 02:11:31,624
Come father

1337
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:36,626
You will not prosper!

1338
02:11:39,157 --> 02:11:40,636
I will pray to the God brother in law...

1339
02:11:43,161 --> 02:11:46,142
..Because I stayed with you
like a dog...

1340
02:11:47,165 --> 02:11:49,645
...You've given me a good gift
- Come father

1341
02:11:50,168 --> 02:11:52,307
You gave me a very good gift!

1342
02:12:09,855 --> 02:12:12,495
Come

1343
02:12:20,532 --> 02:12:21,840
- Did you reveal it
to her? - No

1344
02:12:24,036 --> 02:12:27,848
Mother

1345
02:12:31,710 --> 02:12:34,554
Are you fine?
Nobody informed me

1346
02:12:34,713 --> 02:12:37,694
Even your father didn't
phone me that you are here

1347
02:12:37,883 --> 02:12:39,692
Your uncle left from here
without saying anything

1348
02:12:40,052 --> 02:12:41,030
I got scared!

1349
02:12:41,219 --> 02:12:44,029
My limbs were unmoved after hearing
That's why I went immediately

1350
02:12:44,556 --> 02:12:46,035
Are you fine my dear?

1351
02:12:47,392 --> 02:12:50,032
Mother, I regained my breath
only after seeing you

1352
02:12:52,230 --> 02:12:54,870
Where have you been
all these days?-Mother I feel hungry

1353
02:12:55,067 --> 02:12:59,880
Oh I am a fool! I forgot it. I've prepared
your favorite dishes. Come let's eat

1354
02:13:00,238 --> 02:13:05,415
One of my close friends
He has blood cancer!

1355
02:13:05,577 --> 02:13:07,215
It comes to one in every crore people

1356
02:13:07,346 --> 02:13:10,884
I have marriage here but received
an urgent phone call for me to be there

1357
02:13:11,049 --> 02:13:14,223
If I tell you will stop me
that's why I ran away

1358
02:13:15,087 --> 02:13:17,897
Marriage can wait
but not the life, isn't it mother?

1359
02:13:18,590 --> 02:13:21,230
Poor fellow! How is that boy now?

1360
02:13:21,426 --> 02:13:24,737
He is fine but he can't live longer

1361
02:13:25,530 --> 02:13:29,910
Oh gosh! What an agony it will be
for the parents to lose a young son

1362
02:13:30,602 --> 02:13:35,073
Unfortunate ones
God has cheated them, what can we do?

1363
02:13:36,141 --> 02:13:38,747
Why is he like that?
What happened?

1364
02:13:50,455 --> 02:13:51,593
Both of you have started it again!

1365
02:13:51,790 --> 02:13:54,600
If Lakshmi was here...
Ok where is Lakshmi and brother?

1366
02:13:56,128 --> 02:13:58,108
What can I say about her?

1367
02:13:58,296 --> 02:14:02,267
When we both met I had just teased
her that I will marry another girl

1368
02:14:02,434 --> 02:14:05,608
She felt it bad and went to London
without informing. Mad girl!

1369
02:14:05,804 --> 02:14:08,614
You do all this funny things
What to do now?

1370
02:14:08,774 --> 02:14:14,315
I am going to London. I will bring
her here after apologizing to her

1371
02:14:14,479 --> 02:14:16,618
Isn't it father?-That's all
- Is it? Then let's go

1372
02:14:17,115 --> 02:14:17,957
Where are you coming?

1373
02:14:18,316 --> 02:14:20,455
You make arrangement for the marriage

1374
02:14:20,986 --> 02:14:22,522
I will bring her back

1375
02:14:22,654 --> 02:14:26,033
Yes, there are lot of works I informed it
to your brother! Make al the arrangements!

1376
02:14:26,158 --> 02:14:30,300
I will come with him. Give him the rice
Why are you chatting?

1377
02:14:30,462 --> 02:14:32,806
Rice - Open the mouth

1378
02:14:33,765 --> 02:14:37,508
You go and look after the marriage
works, I will bring back Lakshmi

1379
02:14:37,836 --> 02:14:40,476
Will you come surely?
won't you escape again?

1380
02:14:40,605 --> 02:14:45,350
How can I escape again?
I will just go like this and come back

1381
02:14:45,544 --> 02:14:47,854
If you won't come
It's like I am dead

1382
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:49,818
Are you gone crazy?
won't you believe me?

1383
02:14:49,948 --> 02:14:53,987
I am swearing on me
- Son!- Then what!

1384
02:14:54,519 --> 02:14:56,328
Have both of you gone crazy?
Why do you talk about the death?

1385
02:14:56,455 --> 02:14:57,991
Come this side, You go

1386
02:14:58,690 --> 02:14:59,998
Get in - Is it he?

1387
02:15:00,192 --> 02:15:03,503
He did an accident yesterday!
Why him? You go! His can drive nicely

1388
02:15:03,628 --> 02:15:06,666
I will comeback quickly!
I don't want Dad here! Take him also

1389
02:15:06,798 --> 02:15:09,677
No -Don't speak!
- Marriage works is there, know?

1390
02:15:09,768 --> 02:15:11,679
I will stay with you
- Marriage works is there, know?

1391
02:15:11,837 --> 02:15:15,011
Tell him mother
Father doesn't listen to me

1392
02:15:15,373 --> 02:15:17,011
I will stay with you

1393
02:15:18,543 --> 02:15:19,681
Take care of mother

1394
02:15:23,715 --> 02:15:27,527
- Go safely and bring back Lakshmi
- Ok, take care of father

1395
02:15:30,722 --> 02:15:32,201
I will look forward for you

If you smile ever I will also
smile while looking from there

1426

I am very proud to give birth to you!

1433
02:22:29,807 --> 02:22:33,448
You are not my son
You are my father

1434
02:22:35,146 --> 02:22:36,955
My father should not die like an orphan

1435
02:22:37,882 --> 02:22:39,293
I will be with you

1436
02:22:39,817 --> 02:22:41,296
Think me like your bag!
I don't have anybody other than you

1437
02:22:57,502 --> 02:22:59,982
I want to live for some more days

1438
02:23:01,506 --> 02:23:03,645
Who is that? Is he
asking scooter for festival?

1439
02:23:03,841 --> 02:23:06,321
How can I buy scooter for him?
Tell it won't be possible

1440
02:23:06,511 --> 02:23:09,981
Am I stealing the banks for buying whatever
he asks? It may be our daughter!

1441
02:23:10,114 --> 02:23:13,652
He is asking scooter today. He may ask
Howra mail tomorrow. How can I?

1442
02:23:13,851 --> 02:23:15,330
Keep the phone

1443
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:16,828
I am dying because of son in laws!

1444
02:23:18,523 --> 02:23:21,504
We don't have
- We don't have

1445
02:23:21,859 --> 02:23:23,202
Are you kidding?

1446
02:23:23,361 --> 02:23:26,740
How can you say 'no ticket'?
One shouldn't travel without ticket

1447
02:23:26,864 --> 02:23:28,343
We are not traveling

1448
02:23:28,466 --> 02:23:30,173
- Then who are traveling?
- It's the train

1449
02:23:32,136 --> 02:23:34,173
- Then what are you doing?
- We are sitting

1450
02:23:34,372 --> 02:23:35,851
- Sitting?
- You too sit

1451
02:23:35,974 --> 02:23:38,682
Look mister!
One who travel in the train.

1452
02:23:39,711 --> 02:23:43,682
Whoever sits in the train
should buy the tickets.-Tell me once more

1453
02:23:43,815 --> 02:23:46,295
Whoever sits in the
train should buy the tickets

1454
02:23:46,384 --> 02:23:48,694
Did you buy?
You are sitting right?

1455
02:23:53,224 --> 02:23:54,362
Whoever in the train...

1456
02:24:02,734 --> 02:24:04,372
Sit down

1457
02:24:07,071 --> 02:24:11,747
Everyone in the train should buy ticket

1458
02:24:11,909 --> 02:24:16,415
- Did you buy? -Why should I buy?
- You are also in the train- I am TC

1459
02:24:16,581 --> 02:24:18,720
So what if you are a TC
- So what is your intention?

1460
02:24:18,916 --> 02:24:22,887
You mean everyone in the train
TC, driver, guards, should buy the tickets

1461
02:24:23,021 --> 02:24:25,058
According to you everyone
in the train should buy, right?

1462
02:24:25,156 --> 02:24:28,467
- We are working here
- But you are rewarded for working

1463
02:24:28,593 --> 02:24:32,735
Why are you talking like this?
We are public servants

1464
02:24:33,264 --> 02:24:35,938
Who is public?
- It's us

1465
02:24:36,100 --> 02:24:39,081
- We are public
- We are the owners

1466
02:24:39,270 --> 02:24:41,250
Can the owners buy the ticket?

1467
02:24:45,843 --> 02:24:46,753
Wait

1468
02:24:49,781 --> 02:24:51,454
What did he said?
Isn't he accepting it?

1469
02:24:51,783 --> 02:24:55,253
Do one thing, Kill him
and you too die after that

1470
02:24:55,787 --> 02:24:58,267
Don't worry about me
Couple of members are here, they'll kill me!

1471
02:24:58,356 --> 02:24:59,426
I will also die

1472
02:25:11,469 --> 02:25:13,449
Oh my god!

1473
02:25:15,306 --> 02:25:20,619
<i>As a poet, poem, wife and husband ..</i>

1474
02:25:21,145 --> 02:25:26,652
<i>As a poet, poem, wife and husband ..</i>

02:25:27,151 --> 02:25:32,794
<i>In the jasmine ﬂowers strewn path

1476
02:25:33,157 --> 02:25:35,967
<i>In the jasmine ﬂowers strewn path

1477
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:41,610
<i>Is it a victory song with tears!
Or is it a deluge of tears?</i>

1478
02:25:41,999 --> 02:25:44,946
<i>I enjoyed it myself with amazement!
I am dreaming alone!</i>

1479
02:25:49,006 --> 02:25:54,319
<i>Dreams, stories, dialogues

<i>Epic heroines and girls!</i>

<i>Whole world is my family!
But I lead a solitary life!</i>

1482
02:26:07,859 --> 02:26:08,997
He got caught like that!

1483
02:26:09,527 --> 02:26:11,666
Oh gosh! I am getting a stomach pain!

1484
02:26:12,864 --> 02:26:16,641
I'll die if I stay with you for sometime!

1485
02:26:18,369 --> 02:26:21,009
I can't smile! Stop it, sir

1486
02:26:21,739 --> 02:26:24,652
I don't remember when did I smile last!

1487
02:26:28,913 --> 02:26:32,190
This is the first time after 20 years
I am laughing in this job

1488
02:26:32,383 --> 02:26:35,193
You have told the value of the laughter

1489
02:26:35,720 --> 02:26:38,701
My son had taught this

1490
02:26:38,823 --> 02:26:43,568
Did your son teach you?
Where is he now?

1491
02:26:43,728 --> 02:26:48,199
See here

1492
02:26:56,240 --> 02:27:00,211
Why are you stunned?
Everyone will die

1493
02:27:00,578 --> 02:27:05,220
You will also die, I will also die
But my boy went early

1494
02:27:05,750 --> 02:27:09,391
We should live smiling till our life ends
We should make others smile

1495
02:27:09,821 --> 02:27:13,234
We should laugh until we know its value
This is also taught by my son

1496
02:27:15,326 --> 02:27:18,068
Train has come, let's go

1497
02:28:02,039 --> 02:28:03,609
He is looking from there

1498
02:28:10,481 --> 02:28:16,454
<i>A baby is ready to leave in an
air palanquin, went like a procession!</i>

1499
02:28:19,991 --> 02:28:25,964
<i>Despite closing the voice entrance
with silence, the heart hums it!</i>

1500
02:28:29,166 --> 02:28:32,147
<i>My heart is my loneliness</i>

1501
02:28:33,838 --> 02:28:37,650
<i>My heart is the mother of my songs</i>

1502
02:28:40,177 --> 02:28:43,420
<i>My heart is like my wife</i>

1503
02:28:43,581 --> 02:28:46,494
<i>It is a film journey from my heart!</i>
