00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,900
<i>To arouse the people, the elder
Brutus accused Tarquin the tyrant...</i>

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,100
<i>...of having made artisons and masons
out of free citizens. Livy</i>

Paul Lafargue "The Right to be Lazy"

00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,400
Anatomy of a delivery man

5
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,400
It's very simple. There are the brakes:
hand brakes, foot brake. All easy

6
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,600
The throttle here works like this

7
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,700
And there's gear-changing, of course

8
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,500
Got it, have you? Sure?

9
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,900
You take my place, then.
I'll start it up.

10
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
Not too tight?

11
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,500
There's a shoulder pad on the satchel
strap. Tuck the sleeves up

12
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,500
Never heave: always lift carefully

13
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,200
We'll try with ten bottles first

14
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,800
That's only ten bottles

15
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,400
Fifteen

16
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,500
Petty cash: 150 francs

17
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,800
No, in the satchel.
Put it in the satchel.

18
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,700
Now put your change in

19
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,200
I forgot to tell you:
you're always marked, always

20
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,300
You run after the ball, but it should
come after you when you're not marked

21
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,600
You had a good game, though,
very good

22
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,900
Now I'm working. I'm going to drop it

23
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,300
- Drop what?
- Football

24
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,500
What'll we do on Sundays?

25
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,000
What about your bill?

26
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,000
How much?

27
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
- No it's not... it doesn't matter

28
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,700
All right?

29
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,000
Do you always work here?

30
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,400
I start there and finish there

31
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,300
Is it dirty here?

32
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,600
Cigarette ends, bits of paper,
dog shit

33
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
It's not a street, it's a dog bog

34
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,500
You might at least pay for the wine

35
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,700
All right?

36
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,200
I'm going to try to get married

37
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,000
It's quite normal, you know

38
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,200
At your age, it's quite normal

39
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,600
Of course, at your age it's quite normal

40
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,400
Aren't you coming up?

41
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,800
No, you don't need us

42
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,300
I can't leave your mother alone
too long

43
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,100
I'd sooner have this than
the new models

44
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,300
It's a good little car

45
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,100
One shoulder's higher than the other

46
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,700
It's best for her

47
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,900
Good, keep it going like that

48
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,100
I'm getting the license...
it's for lorries

49
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,200
They're difficult, lorries are

50
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,900
Especially as I don't know anyone
at the head office

51
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,000
Well, if you don't know anyone...

52
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Listen!

53
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,600
Tomorrow I'm going to head office

54
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,300
Maybe they'll let me have a lorry

55
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,600
Come in.

56
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,800
-Are you the driver?
- Yes

57
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,600
Come in.

58
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,000
Close the door.

59
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,200
Sit down, young man

60
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,300
You put in a request for a lorry,
didn't you?

61
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,200
It isn't simple as all that

62
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,100
You need...  seniority and...

63
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,900
... and the confidence of your superiors

64
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,000
The drivers are on strike today

65
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,000
We'll give you a trial

66
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,100
Right away

67
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Give me deliveries

68
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,600
Will you come up, Monsieur Gaspard?

69
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,300
If you go on strike, now or
ten years from now...

70
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,500
...you'll lose your lorry

71
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,100
There'll be no excuses

72
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,800
Find him a lorry; he's starting today

73
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,400
You can go

74
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,700
Come here, I won't eat you!

75
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,700
We'll run through the controls

76
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,600
What do you want for sweet?

77
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,500
Again?

78
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,800
Great, eh?

79
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,600
Yes, what a nice lorry

80
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,100
I fancied a trip to the country

81
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,200
Not just now, I'm busy cooking.

82
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,400
He said: "If you go on strike now or ten
years from now, you'll looe the lorry

83
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,500
"There'll be no excuses", he said

84
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,000
That's disgusting

85
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,400
I wouldn't have got the lorry
otherwise

86
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,000
What would you like for sweet?

87
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,700
You're just in time for sweet

88
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
You can sleep there, can you?

89
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,800
Well, I'll go to my cousin's

90
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,400
Right, kids...

91
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,200
...it's all happening

92
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,200
I didn't feel like clocking in,
that's all

93
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,400
Just like that? All of a sudden?

94
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,000
I was just thinking...

95
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:29,800
I was just thinking to myself: you
retire in ten years time

96
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,300
Well, then, why not quit now?

97
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So, of course...

98
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,000
...I stuck to my guns

99
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,200
I waited till I was sure

100
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,300
I watched them clocking in
for ten minutes

101
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,800
Ten minutes at least

102
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:02,100
After that I was sure,
so I cleared off

103
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,200
Tidy the couch, kids

104
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,100
I wonder wheter you ought to have
kept on the safe side, you know?

105
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,400
In these circumstances I should have
refused the lorry, you mean?

106
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,600
Is it spades again?

107
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,500
If it's money...

108
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:33,500
No, that's no problem...
as long as you're working

109
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,500
What's the matter then, dad?

110
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,600
You let me share your house
and your food...

111
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,200
You're not letting worry you?

112
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I haven't got a woman

113
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,400
I'm not thinking of your mother

114
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,700
At least, I may think of her...

115
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,700
...but not that way

116
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,300
Not that way?

117
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,500
A woman...

118
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,800
A woman now and again...

119
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,200
A sort of mistress, you know

120
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,900
So I was wondering...

121
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,200
What can we do about it?

122
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,400
What can we do about it?

123
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,800
Well, exactly

124
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,600
You see...

125
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,000
Just friendly like, now and again

126
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,000
I'm trying to think

127
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,200
Don't track your brain

128
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,000
Germaine

129
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,300
Germaine?

130
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,700
Yes

131
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,600
Everything all right, you two?

132
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,500
Dad and I...

133
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,500
...want say to ask you something

134
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,800
Done the washing up?

135
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:51,500
We could have given you a hand

136
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,600
A hand?

137
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:14,400
Dad's very happy here, but
there's something he needs

138
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,400
Just now and again, you know

139
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,200
We mustn't over do it

140
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,600
What is it? What does he need?

141
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,600
Dad isn't old, you know

142
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,400
Well, not old enough to...

143
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,700
Especially now that I'm not working

144
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,200
That's right he's not tired
or anything

145
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,300
So...well...why shouldn't he?

146
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,900
Now and again

147
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,100
When it suits

148
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,900
In the daytime

149
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,500
Or in the mornings

150
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,600
That's right

151
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,100
Not too often

152
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,600
Just friendly like

153
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,900
What a carry on

154
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,100
The fact is...

155
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,200
At last

156
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,600
Of course I will

157
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,300
Is it really so difficult to ask?

158
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,000
Of course I don't mind

159
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,900
I can't ...

160
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,800
Go back to sleep

161
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,300
I can't get used to getting up late

162
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,500
But I really get a kick out of
staying in bed

163
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,000
Stay were you are, I'll do it

164
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,300
Aren't you having any?

165
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,600
No, I'll eat later, with Germaine

166
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,900
-What time do you clock in?
- Six

167
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,300
How's your lorry going?

168
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,100
You'll catch a cold like that

169
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,500
I'll take off my slippers

170
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,600
What were you saying about the lorry?

171
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,000
When?

172
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,300
Give dad some money if he
wants to get out

173
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Isn't he fabulous?

174
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,400
You both are

175
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,400
You're both fabulous

176
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,400
Would you hand me the crate,
please?

177
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:55,900
Enough?

178
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:59,200
Yes, I'm just going out to get
a bit of sun

179
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,100
How do you like it? It's very pretty

180
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,100
It's not my size

181
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:06,300
Don't you like it?

182
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:17,400
Petrol I don't mind;
it's the diesel oil

183
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:23,700
Twenty-five years I've inhaled it
and I can't stand the smell of it

184
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,200
Twenty-five years I've worked here;
never missed a working day

185
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Fancy that, boss

186
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,400
In my cap...I put it in my cap!

187
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,800
She couldn't get over it

188
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:14,800
He's really great, your dad.
Look what he stole

189
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:29,000
I stole the dress, just the dress

190
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,300
My son

191
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,100
It's the same every evening

192
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,600
Right, kids, it's all happening

193
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,800
Four times a day

194
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:16,600
Twenty-five years minus holidays;
tell me how many times I clocked in

195
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:20,600
What's more, my father's the managing
director of your factory

196
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,000
Keep your nose to the grindstone, son

197
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,900
The pleasure's all mine

198
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,900
We met in a shop window, too

199
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:48,300
I saw your legs, and decided
to give up football

200
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:51,700
Tomorrow we'll lift some champagne
and celebrate

201
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,000
It's Sunday, tomorrow

202
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,000
It's all happening

203
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,800
Do you play pinochle?

204
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,800
Who wants sweet?

205
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,400
Guess who?

206
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,600
My boss's daughter?

207
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,600
When I think...

208
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,400
I bought the bread,
but stole the croissants

209
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,100
We're all thieves in this family

210
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,800
Listen...about your mother...

211
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,700
Let's not talk about that, dad

212
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:48,400
You were right; she was
worn-out and unhappy

213
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,400
But her accident...
didn't it surprise you?

214
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:14,100
It's very strange. Everyone
finds it quite normal

215
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,100
All the same...

216
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,900
...I did wonder a bit

217
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,800
I wondered if maybe she'd
killed herself

218
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:37,100
She was worn-out, unhappy,
always complaining, you know

219
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,000
Always snivelling, poor soul

220
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,200
There was nothing to be done about it

221
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,400
You think so?

222
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:01,500
I'm sure of it. I go for
the accident idea

223
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:05,400
She didn't know what was happening

224
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:17,900
You think so?

225
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,500
I'm sure of it

226
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,000
It wasn't an accident

227
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:01,700
It's turning out nice

228
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,300
Not an accident?

229
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,500
It was me

230
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,700
I assumed my responsibilities

231
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,700
How did it happen?

232
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:09,300
Well she'd taken pills
to make her sleep

233
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,600
I turned on the gas

234
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,700
Then I hid in the bog

235
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,500
I'd opened the fanlight

236
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:28,900
I wondered about going with her, but
I was afraid. I wasn't asleep, you see

237
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:33,000
Did you wait long?

238
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:37,400
Yes, a long time

239
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:41,900
It was tough

240
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I assumed my responsibilities,
you see

241
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:57,400
Do you understand me?

242
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,500
Don't call me dad anymore

243
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I share your home;
yes, I share your home

244
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,300
I killed your mother

245
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,300
I make love with your wife

246
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,200
Call me...Paulo

247
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:56,000
Tomorrow I'm going to get my record
player and give it to you

248
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,900
Happy birthday!

249
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,800
She's very sweet

250
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,100
We make a great foursome

251
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,600
To clocking in!

252
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,400
To shoplifting!

253
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:37,200
To all four of us;
don't be exclusive

254
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,000
It's incredible

255
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,600
Can't anyone go?

256
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:52,700
Then I will

257
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:57,800
Isn't your father awful?

258
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,500
Hearts are trumps, eh?

259
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,800
I don't want to go work

260
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,900
Look

261
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,400
Isn't she sweet?

262
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,700
I'd like some marmalade, please

263
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,800
Is there any coffee left?

264
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,200
Do you want a croissant?

265
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:22,900
A little butter with it, please

266
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,000
I`ll use your spoon

267
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:45,000
Can I borrow your knife, please?

268
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:48,100
I want some butter

269
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,400
This bra's the wrong size

270
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,300
Do you wear a bra?

271
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:08,100
Of course I don't

272
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,800
You can't always choose what you steal

273
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:18,900
It would fit you

274
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:22,100
- I'm bigger than you there
- I think you've a lovely bust

275
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:26,000
Don't touch your hands are cold!

276
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,400
Are you going far?

277
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,400
To Kremlin Bicêtre

278
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,500
I'll take you there

279
01:27:58,500 --> 01:27:59,500
What are you going to Kremlin-Bicêntre for?

280
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:03,500
To look for a friend

281
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:07,700
A black

282
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,400
A black street-sweeper

283
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,700
Are you in a hurry?

284
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,400
It's a present from my boss

285
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,900
To all who clock in!

286
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,400
Listen, kids...

287
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:28,900
What I suggest is...

288
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,300
Isn't your father awful?

289
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,300
Tomorrow...

290
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,600
...quite soon, that is...

291
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:54,100
...if it's fine...

292
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:58,900
...we're off to the south

293
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,600
You can't really see

294
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:34,900
If it was full moon,
we could see if it's fine

295
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,100
I can't see a thing

296
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:50,400
It's going to be a terrific day,
I tell you...

297
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,700
...but I've really no idea

298
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:02,500
That's it

299
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,500
I'm sure

300
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,700
Have you lost something?

301
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,400
On the contrary

302
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:14,900
I'm going to have a baby

303
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:27,500
What's the matter? What's going on?
