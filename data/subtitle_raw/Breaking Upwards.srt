# Mister Lister #

2
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:23,562
- # Mister Lister #

3
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:57,668
- Nothing?

4
00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:59,365
- It's okay, honey, just come.

5
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:00,373
- What?

6
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:02,398
- It's okay.

7
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:04,467
- Do you want to get high?

8
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:06,411
- No, I don't have any.

9
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:09,210
I'm not calling my mom,
so just come.

10
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:13,447
Really, it's fine.

11
00:01:25,298 --> 00:01:28,597
Sorry.

12
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:50,923
Aw.

13
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:58,926
- Are you bored?

14
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:01,866
- I mean,
I guess maybe a little.

15
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:06,635
- Wow, that sucks.

16
00:02:06,673 --> 00:02:07,799
- It doesn't mean anything, D.

17
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:11,277
I mean, it's just what happens.

18
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:14,542
<i>- Wow, that sucks.</i>

19
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:16,947
- It's like, I still love you.

20
00:02:16,983 --> 00:02:20,919
- So what do we do?

21
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:35,157
<i>- # Nous sommes le nous,

22
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:39,230

- Whoo!
- Whoo!

25
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:47,069
Smoke and mirrors!

26
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:48,171
- This is my blind boyfriend.

27
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:49,409
He's a mirror.
I'm a cigarette.

28
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:53,909
- # He is the he #

29
00:02:53,954 --> 00:03:01,520

41
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:42,001
- I feel like we have
to take half the week off,

42
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:44,435
if we're really going
to do this, you know?

43
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:47,463
We-we can't half-ass it,

44
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:48,872
or else what
are we accomplishing?

45
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:49,876
- Okay, that's fine.

46
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,070
Then let's set it.

47
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:52,305
But I don't want it
to be random.

48
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:53,744
- Okay.

49
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,011
Monday, Wednesday, Saturday.

50
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,449
- Are those off or on?

51
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:00,112
- On.

52
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:01,620
- Three days?

53
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:02,622
- And Thursday.

54
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:03,816
- What about Tuesday?

55
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:05,119
<i>I want to watch the Idol
with you.</i>

56
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:06,284
- Oh, fuck, you're right.

57
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:08,954
- Ready?
- Ready.

58
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:10,929
- Oh!
- Sucker!

59
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:12,727
- Go ahead, your pick: days on.

60
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:13,733
- Tuesday, Saturday

61
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:14,791
- Wait, wait, one at a time.

62
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:16,096
- Okay, Saturday.

63
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:17,865
- What happened to Tuesday?

64
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:19,633
- Why would I pick it when I
know what you're gonna pick?

65
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:20,833
I only have two picks.
You pick, go.

66
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:22,398
<i>- Tuesday, Idol.</i>

67
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:24,000
- Um, Monday, since we're dark.

68
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:26,410
- Friiiiii-
Thursday.

69
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:29,506

Thursday, Saturday.

70
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:30,709
Final answer?
- Final answer.

71
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,116
This is exciting.

72
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:41,886
- Write your own.

73
00:04:41,928 --> 00:04:43,486
- All right.

74
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,399
Done.

75
00:04:51,438 --> 00:04:52,928
- There are many things
wrong with you.

76
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:54,099
Would you like me to list them?

77
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,438
- Want me to list them?

78
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:14,550
- Okay, what do you got?

79
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,431
- Okay.

80
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:21,525
Being proactive.

81
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:23,160
- Check.

82
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:24,670
- Um, really sticking
to our days off.

83
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:26,831
- No chance in hell.
Check.

84
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:28,170
- Okay, what do you have?

85
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,506
- Strip clubs.

86
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:31,805
Trying new things.

87
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:33,437
- Is that the same as growth?

88
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,505
- I had them separate.

89
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:39,484
- Okay, um, okay.

90
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:45,086
No calling on days off.

91
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,319
- Your loss.

92
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:47,326
- And being independent.

93
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,920
And that is very key, Daryl.

94
00:05:49,963 --> 00:05:51,828
- Listen, you can't use
my Netflix queue.

95
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:53,127
I know I've got
a big queue, but-

96
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,463
- Very funny, Daryl.

97
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:57,493
- Also, I like to walk
on the west side of the street,

98
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:59,596
and we can't be on G-chat
anymore.

99
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,606
- You're always on!

100
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,868
- I'll fix that.

101
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:03,705
- Fine, I get Whole Foods.

102
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:04,710
- Overpriced.

103
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:06,143
I get all city parks.

104
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:07,874
- Daryl.
- Okay, fine.

105
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:10,007
I get Madison Square Park
from 2:00 to 4:00.

106
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,711
I'm going to need time to write.

107
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:14,083
- All right.
Anything we left off?

108
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,850
- I think that's everything.

109
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,324
- Let's get to Kinko's
and laminate.

110
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,587
- Sweet.

111
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:46,875
Oh, yeah.

112
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,512
- Honey?

113
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:49,852
- What?

114
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,722
- What do I put on my Facebook?

115
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,590
- Put whatever you want.

116
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:58,253
Wait, you're on Facebook?

117
00:06:58,298 --> 00:06:59,731
- Yeah.

118
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:00,892
- What?

119
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:03,095
When did you put yourself
on Facebook?

120
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:05,604
- Honey,
MySpace is kind of dead.

121
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:06,969
- Really?

122
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:13,168
- Okay, I picked you up
out of the dirt

123
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:14,180
when you were nothing.

124
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:15,442
You're not a man.

125
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:17,347
You're a child,
the epitome of classlessness.

126
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:18,645
How could you do this to me,
Korny?

127
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:19,913
- Okay.

128
00:07:19,953 --> 00:07:21,853
- Okay, good, now do it
with conviction this time.

129
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:22,855
Really own it.

130
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:24,186
- Okay, I picked you
out of the dirt

131
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:26,784
when you were fucking nothing,
a piece of shit.

132
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:28,225
You're not a man.

133
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:29,353
You're a fucking little boy.

134
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:32,330
- Easy.
- You're a fucking epitome of-

135
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:33,832
What is it?
- Olasslessness.

136
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:35,027
- Olasslessness.

137
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:38,367
How could you do this
to me, Korny? Korny?

138
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:40,031
How could you fucking do this
to me, Korny?

139
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:41,631
- You're fucking fired.

140
00:07:41,674 --> 00:07:42,800
You're fired.

141
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:44,434
- Okay, here, take that.

142
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:46,468
- All right, I'll see you later.

143
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:47,502
Book that commercial.

144
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:53,844
- Great, thanks.

145
00:07:57,357 --> 00:08:01,225
All right.

146
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:02,319
Okay, next.

147
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:06,128
Time for your picture.

148
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:10,159
Right here.

149
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:11,170
Excellent.

150
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:15,072
Nice.

151
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:25,341
Great, thanks.

152
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:27,853
- They're four heads above me.

153
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:29,149
They look at me
like I'm an alien,

154
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:30,315
like I have fucking leprosy.

155
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:32,051
I'm gonna call
immigration services.

156
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:33,058
I'm not kidding.

157
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:35,424
- Can you get me some numbers?

158
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:36,655
<i>- They think they're actresses.</i>

159
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:38,061
They're not fucking actresses.

160
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:40,622
They're models
with their fucking big books,

161
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:41,793
their fucking long legs,

162
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:43,769
<i>talking on
their fancy cell phones.</i>

163
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:46,067
<i>They got so much money
from all the men</i>

164
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:48,596
that shower them with gifts,
for what, for what?

165
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,165
For being tall?

166
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,440
Give me a gift for being short.

167
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:53,638
- I know, honey, it's terrible.

168
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,840
<i>- It's like,
I got a prettier face.</i>

169
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:56,143
<i>They're dogfaces.</i>

170
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:58,582
They're dogfaces
with their long legs.

171
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:02,054
Dogfaces
and fucking giraffe legs.

172
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:03,851
- Immigrants, yeah, immigrants.

173
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,380
<i>- Minotaurs:</i>

174
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:06,756
half beast, half woman.

175
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:08,351
- Try out the copy on me.

176
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:12,956
- Yeah, Okay.

177
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,490
We had nothing
after the floods came.

178
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:19,605
- There you are!

179
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,732
- Hi.
- Hi.

180
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:23,709
Thanks again.

181
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:25,233
- Yeah, my pleasure.

182
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:26,506
I'll see you tomorrow.

183
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:28,343
- Bye.
- Bye.

184
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:31,009
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

185
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,484
- Come on.

186
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:45,996
- What's up?

187
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:49,058
Sorry I'm late.

188
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:50,194
Let's go.

189
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:53,535
- Let's go.

190
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:06,583
- What's up, boys?

191
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:08,246
- Oh, snap.

192
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:09,448
- What are you guys doing here?

193
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:11,753
- I'm here to fuck your friend.

194
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,316
No, I'm here for the art.

195
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,157
- I'll fuck anybody.

196
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:19,757
- Oh, my God.

197
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,766
Honey, look at that.

198
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,290
- It's nice.

199
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,461
- There are so many.

200
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,766
- So this is his first
foray into art.

201
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:30,139
- Oh, yeah?

202
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:32,371
- You know, I'm taking
my entire kitchen

203
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:35,711
to the International House
for this performance piece.

204
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:38,911
- What is that, like a-
like a onesie?

205
00:10:38,952 --> 00:10:40,180
- A onesie?

206
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:42,153
- See, I told you
it was going to work out.

207
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:43,780
- Wuzzup.
- What are you doing?

208
00:10:43,823 --> 00:10:45,450
Did you just touch me?

209
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:47,584
- Um, yeah?

210
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:48,594
- Don't touch me.

211
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:49,595
- Okay.

212
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:56,057
Sorry.

213
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:57,831
- Oh, that's really nice.

214
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,701
Good guy.

215
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:03,106
Really classy stuff.

216
00:11:03,142 --> 00:11:06,737
All right, night's over.

217
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,942
- So how's work?

218
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:13,111
- Fine.

219
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:19,185
- Anything exciting?

220
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:20,920
- Daryl, it's dentistry.

221
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,418
I look into people's mouths
for a living.

222
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:27,365
- Right.

223
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,027
So I think I'm going
to be home more.

224
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:30,262
- Oh, yeah?

225
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:32,771
- Yeah, Zoe and me-

226
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:34,067
- Hey, that's great.

227
00:11:34,107 --> 00:11:35,404
You can help me
with the computer.

228
00:11:35,441 --> 00:11:36,408
- What?

229
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:37,773
- Yeah,
I can't get the photos-

230
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,540
You know, I can't get the photos
off the digital camera,

231
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,638
so you can help me.

232
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:44,411
That's terrific.

233
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:31,054
- That's it, just squat down
and stand.

234
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:33,327
And then go ahead
and bring your arms up.

235
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:35,163
We're going to go
into downward dog.

236
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,897
- Zoe?

237
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:40,371
- Honey, I can't talk
right now, okay?

238
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:41,634
I'm on my way to rehearsal.

239
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:44,268
Talk to you later, bye.

240
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:49,805
- Tolan!

241
00:12:57,457 --> 00:12:59,925
- I can't talk right now.

242
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,187
Okay.

243
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:04,856
Bye.

244
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:05,864
Hi.

245
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:07,331
- Hi, Turner.

246
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:08,492
- Zoe.

247
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:10,968
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

248
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:13,528
- Mark out some time
where we can talk about this?

249
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:14,540
Okay, okay.

250
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:16,166
Thank you.
Great.

251
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:18,177
Okay, thanks.

252
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,270
- All right.

253
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:22,076
Hello, everyone.

254
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:23,605
So thank you all.

255
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:25,844
I'm very pleased you're here.
Thank you all.

256
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:27,819
And I think it's great
we've got the theater today

257
00:13:27,854 --> 00:13:30,823
just to get a feel of it
on the first day,

258
00:13:30,857 --> 00:13:32,552
which I think will be good.

259
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:34,389
And I thought we'd just start
sort of very easily

260
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:36,691
by reading through the play
and sort of not doing anything.

261
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:46,834
- By the time the sun
was setting,

262
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:50,274
the loneliness was physical.

263
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:51,901
It had taken on matter

264
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:55,744
and was musical
like a heartbeat.

265
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:59,308
Lonely, lonely, lonely.

266
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:00,979
That's when the phone rang.

267
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,580
That's when I found out-oh.

268
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:05,887
I'm going to say, "discovered."

269
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:07,290
Is that okay?

270
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:08,884
That's when l-
I'm gonna take that back.

271
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:11,192
That's when the phone rang.

272
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,428
That's when I discovered
what had happened.

273
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:17,698
The way I felt was numb.

274
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:21,132
- Oh, my God.

275
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:22,607
I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

276
00:14:22,642 --> 00:14:23,631
- Turn it off.

277
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:25,041
- Yeah, I really thought
it was off.

278
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:26,977
- Is it off?

279
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:27,980
Okay, keep going.

280
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:29,481
No, just turn it off.

281
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:32,882
- Um, are you-
okay.

282
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,911
You know,
I'm gonna have to go back.

283
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:37,081
I'm a little nervous.

284
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:38,090
That shook me up.

285
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:39,216
- Want some water?

286
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:41,488
- Yeah, could you get me-

287
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:44,724
just have this one
removed too, okay.

288
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:49,758
Just then, the sun began
going under the horizon.

289
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:11,079
- Well, maybe he thinks
that you're taken.

290
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:13,284
Maybe he can smell it on you.

291
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:16,420
- No, if anything, that makes me
more attractive.

292
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:20,159
- No, actually, that only works
for men.

293
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:22,224
- Well, whatever, then he
probably has a girlfriend.

294
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:24,759
- Maybe.
- Oh, my God.

295
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:28,035
- Jack and diet
and vodka tonic.

296
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:30,304
- Thank you.

297
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:34,713
- I'm fat.

298
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:35,736
- Whatever, Zo.

299
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:38,215
He just wants a big tip,
all right?

300
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:39,843
Plus, you have a boyfriend!

301
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:41,978
- Snooze!

302
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:46,458
- Zo, my relationships
last about five minutes.

303
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:50,189
- Yeah, try sex four years in.

304
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:59,230
- Oh, good morning, Father.

305
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:01,433
- Hey.

306
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,965
- Oh, don't you touch that.
Don't you dare.

307
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,238
- Good morning, Mom.

308
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:07,974
- You know I like my cup
and my spoon just so.

309
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:09,276
- A little COD, okay.

310
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:10,907
- Well, if you're going to live
in my house,

311
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,417
you have to deal with my shit.

312
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:14,214
Good morning, honey.

313
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:15,345
You want some coffee?

314
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:16,355
- I got it.

315
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:17,356
- What are you reading?

316
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,357
- Daryl's article.

317
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:19,688
- Oh, article?
What?

318
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:21,249
I'm your spellchecker.

319
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:22,784
- You're fair.

320
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:23,795
That's what I like.

321
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:24,955
They're in jail.

322
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:26,430
What's my first impression
gonna be?

323
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:28,490
But some of them even seem nice.

324
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:29,865
Dangerous nice,
like that guy

325
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:31,767
who used to be
our old super, Marty.

326
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:35,365
- Alan,
Marty was a schizophrenic.

327
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:37,603
Hey, come here.
I want to talk to you.

328
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:39,406
Come, come, come, come, come.

329
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:44,182
Hey.

330
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:45,376
- What?

331
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:48,319
- I ask you, I beg you.

332
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:51,323
Let me buy you some shoes,
please, real shoes

333
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:53,325
like shiny loafers
or hip slip-ons-

334
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,951
- Mom, no.
- Anything but this.

335
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:56,018
- I love these shoes.

336
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:57,222
- And these pants.

337
00:16:57,263 --> 00:16:58,423
- What's wrong with my pants?

338
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:00,329
- Good Lord, Daryl,
they're so tight.

339
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:01,390
Tell me they're Zoe's.

340
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:02,401
- They are mine.

341
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:03,493
- Are you wearing girl pants?

342
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:04,662
- These are man pants, Mom.

343
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:07,502
- They look like tiny girl
stripper pants.

344
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,201
- They are my pants, Mom.

345
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,175
- Do you have to lay down
to put them on?

346
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,177
- Okay.

347
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:13,735
- How much did you pay
for those?

348
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:14,746
- A lot of money.

349
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,078
They're A.P.O.

350
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:18,674
- Oh, my God,
more than a hundred?

351
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:19,685
- I am leaving.

352
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,186
- Oh, my God.

353
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,314
If my grandchildren
come out short and stubby,

354
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:25,324
we'll know why.

355
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:27,155
It's those pants.

356
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:32,221
He paid more than $100
for those girl pants.

357
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:34,630
I know.

358
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:07,855
<i>- # Baby, baby, baby, please #</i>

359
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:13,600
<i># Baby, baby, I'm on my knees #</i>

360
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:15,573
<i># You're hot as hell #</i>

361
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:19,840
<i># I'm gonna freeze #</i>

362
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:23,679
<i># Baby, baby, baby, please #</i>

363
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:30,418
<i># Baby, baby, baby, stay #</i>

364
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:31,946
- What's up?

365
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:34,349
What?

366
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:35,485
Zoe!

367
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:37,496
What's going on?

368
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:47,896
- Don't you bring
that thing in here.

369
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,032
- Oh, my God.

370
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:50,405
Sir, everything's under control.

371
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:52,707
Please, just don't call PETA.

372
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:56,044
Thank you.

373
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:01,281
Oh, my God.

374
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,515
What the hell is going on?

375
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:04,989
- Look what he did, D.

376
00:19:05,024 --> 00:19:06,321
He shat on my Chanel.

377
00:19:06,358 --> 00:19:08,292
- Oh, my God,
not the Chanel.

378
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:09,692
- It took me months
to find that van.

379
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:11,628
I mean, those Chinese
are surprisingly discreet.

380
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:13,097
- Honey, why the hell
did you buy a dog?

381
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:14,622
- I don't know.

382
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,897
It was our day off.
I was trying to grow.

383
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:20,634
What are we gonna do?

384
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:22,436
Come on, you got to get her
out of the box.

385
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:23,601
Get her out of the box.

386
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:25,439
- No, she stays in there,
or I'm leaving.

387
00:19:25,478 --> 00:19:29,346
- What happened
to unconditional love, kitty?

388
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:32,680
What happened
to unconditional love?

389
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:34,049
- Mom, it's a dog.

390
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:36,145
- All right, you have got
to calm down.

391
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:39,157
- Who's a little boogoo booboo?

392
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:40,624
- Daryl, I read that piece
you wrote.

393
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:42,820
It is so good.

394
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:44,193
You are a really good writer.

395
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,322
- Thank you.

396
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:46,729
- Have you shown it
to anybody else?

397
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:49,632
- I'm working for this big-time
journalist now.

398
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:51,727
- That's good.
What about her?

399
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,000
- Yeah, I would love
to give it to her,

400
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,700
but, you know,
she's busy and stuff.

401
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:57,072
- So is she smart?

402
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:58,076
Could she help you?

403
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,509
- She is so smart, yeah.

404
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:03,311
She is a professor of
public policy and human rights.

405
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:06,546
- That's heavy.
Good.

406
00:20:06,585 --> 00:20:07,950
- And he wants
to sleep with her.

407
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:09,716
- What?
I do not.

408
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:12,087
- You got to start somewhere.

409
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:17,328
- So we wanted to talk to you.

410
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:21,060
- All right, go ahead.

411
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,068
I'm all ears.

412
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:27,861
- Well, obviously,
nothing lasts forever.

413
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:29,636
Obviously.

414
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:36,080
And I love Daryl very much.

415
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:38,549
- And he loves you.

416
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:41,849
- We are taking days off.

417
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:45,650
- Okay.

418
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:48,387
I'm not sure
I know what that means.

419
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:50,418
- I'm sorry.

420
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:52,054
Just give me a moment.

421
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:53,064
I just-

422
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:54,065
- What?

423
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:55,157
- Just one minute.

424
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,896
- Okay, okay,
let her deal with it.

425
00:20:57,937 --> 00:21:01,532
- You know,
we talked about this,

426
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:03,337
taking a few days off.

427
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,173
- You know, I tried to raise
a daughter

428
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:08,941
who wasn't gonna be afraid
of being alone.

429
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:11,040
It's tough out there.

430
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,017
I can be with a loser
who doesn't want to be alone

431
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:15,213
or a loser who deserves to be.

432
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:16,380
- You're smoking.

433
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:18,720
- Yeah, why aren't there
more of you?

434
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:20,918
Way to go, biatch.

435
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:23,959
- Daryl!

436
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:25,429
- Coming!

437
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:34,171
- Hey, welcome to Brooklyn,
you shit-sniffing cocksucker.

438
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:50,988
- Microdermabrasion!

439
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:53,184
- Kiddie yoga!

440
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:04,867
- You have to tell me
if this is too much.

441
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:07,463
I don't want it
to get all Trump Taj Mahal.

442
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:08,632
Ooh, pretty.

443
00:22:08,674 --> 00:22:10,471
- I think I should be
in therapy.

444
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:12,033
- What?
Why?

445
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:13,476
You know who should be
in therapy?

446
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:14,877
Your father
should be in therapy.

447
00:22:14,913 --> 00:22:16,107
- Dad?
Why?

448
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:18,013
- Ooh, he's fat.

449
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,348
Or maybe we could get him
on that program.

450
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:21,876
How do we get him
on that program?

451
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,944
- What program?

452
00:22:22,988 --> 00:22:24,853
- You know, the program
where you're fat

453
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,654
and then you lose weight,
and they give you money.

454
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:28,921
Or do you have to be
a celebrity?

455
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:30,656
Is that celebrity fat people?

456
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:32,095
- I'm trying to talk to you!

457
00:22:32,131 --> 00:22:33,098
- Well, talk then.

458
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:34,599
So talk.
Let's talk.

459
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:35,895
How are you?
How's Zoe?

460
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:37,128
How are things?

461
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:38,568
- I don't know,
we're just kind of...

462
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:39,730
- Tell her you're sorry.

463
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:41,763
- For what?

464
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:43,240
- It doesn't matter.

465
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:45,971
Come on,
I'll make you some tea.

466
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:46,978
- I don't know.

467
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:49,003
Is the quinoa really salty?

468
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:50,982
Last time I had it here
it was really salty.

469
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:52,779
- No, it's actually...

470
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:54,342
- You know what?

471
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:55,353
Oh, God, I don't know.

472
00:22:55,387 --> 00:22:57,150
Nothing looks good.

473
00:22:57,189 --> 00:22:59,123
Never mind,
give me the Dragon Bowl.

474
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:00,455
I'll love it.
- Okay.

475
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:02,221
- I'm gonna get that too.
- Great.

476
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:03,751
- But you know what?
No beans.

477
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:04,820
- Me too.
- Got it.

478
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:08,933
- Last thing I need is gas.

479
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:11,561
- She doesn't take the menus.

480
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:13,571
- So how's your tummy?

481
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:15,402
- Why?

482
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:17,409
- It's always so emotionally
sensitive.

483
00:23:17,443 --> 00:23:19,434
- Oh, yeah.
No, yeah.

484
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:20,638
It's been--

485
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:22,670
It's a little funny.

486
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:25,115
- Yeah, yeah, me too.

487
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,640
So bloated all the time.

488
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:28,482
Oh, my God,
I look at a piece of fish,

489
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,283
and I want to blow up.

490
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:32,517
Oh, God, what we do
for our children.

491
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:33,525
Never mind.

492
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:34,787
You're beautiful. Who cares?

493
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:36,385
Moving on.
It's not your fault.

494
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:37,759
I'm not gonna get into it.

495
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:38,956
Anyway, how's D?

496
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:40,897
- I don't know, Mom.

497
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:42,161
You're out of your mind.

498
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:44,726
He's fine-
I don't know, he's-

499
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,795
When he's with me,
I want to kill him.

500
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:47,999
When he's not, I miss him.

501
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,405
I'm, like-
I'm a mess.

502
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:51,033
- You are a mess.
- Yeah.

503
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:52,043
- What's going on with you?

504
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:53,237
- I don't know.

505
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:56,611
- Boy, you have always been
so codependent, Zoe,

506
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:58,275
ever since you
were a little child.

507
00:23:58,317 --> 00:23:59,579
- Yeah?

508
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:00,744
- You were so cute,

509
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:03,084
always hanging on my leg
every place we went.

510
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:04,885
Wouldn't let me go in one room.

511
00:24:04,923 --> 00:24:07,391
You would just go, "Mama!"

512
00:24:07,426 --> 00:24:09,257
Funny.

513
00:24:09,294 --> 00:24:10,591
You're not easy, honey.

514
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:13,120
You are not easy at all.

515
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:14,632
- What is that supposed to mean?

516
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,567
- It means you're needy,
sweetie.

517
00:24:19,071 --> 00:24:20,629
- Shh, I'm not needy.

518
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:22,196
- Yes, you are.
You're very needy.

519
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:24,106
You're not easy at all.

520
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:25,508
- Yeah, and all
your relationships

521
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:27,535
have ultimately failed, so...

522
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:30,446
- You are so fucking judgmental
sometimes.

523
00:24:30,482 --> 00:24:31,449
- Needy, Mom.

524
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:33,417
- You are so sensitive.
- Honestly?

525
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:37,980
- I can't even talk to you.

526
00:24:38,023 --> 00:24:41,720
Zoe, come here.

527
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,752
You weren't a burden.

528
00:24:44,797 --> 00:24:47,027
I just want you to be happy.
That's all.

529
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:50,466
I've lived a lot of mistakes
that you don't have to make.

530
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:51,469
- Like what?

531
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:52,800
- Like this manic cycle

532
00:24:52,838 --> 00:24:56,205
of pushing people away
and then needing them,

533
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:59,506
your fear of independence.

534
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:01,342
I think a lot of people
would be surprised

535
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,076
to see how really fearful
you are.

536
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:09,951
- Do you think
I'm pushing him away?

537
00:25:09,988 --> 00:25:12,047
- I don't know, honey.

538
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:16,652
I think you need to be alone.

539
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:21,898
- We really shouldn't
be doing this.

540
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:23,196
<i>- I know.</i>

541
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:25,032
I'm really sorry, D,
but I just needed to talk.

542
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,537
<i>- Well, it's our day off.</i>

543
00:25:26,572 --> 00:25:28,506
- Do you think that I'm, like,

544
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,374
too needy or that I'm pushing
you away in some way?

545
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:33,742
- If we don't follow
the rules now,

546
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,679
<i>it's never gonna work.
- Oh, the rules.</i>

547
00:25:35,714 --> 00:25:36,703
All right, D.

548
00:25:36,748 --> 00:25:37,737
You know what?
Fuck you.

549
00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:39,080
Thanks for clarifying.

550
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:41,051
Fucking asshole.

551
00:25:41,086 --> 00:25:43,384
- Wow, fuck you, huh?

552
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,224
- Frustration rides you well.

553
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:48,385
- That's a good line.

554
00:25:48,427 --> 00:25:50,691
It must work
on all the insecure actresses.

555
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:53,630
- Well, working is relative.

556
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:56,425
You all right?

557
00:25:58,136 --> 00:25:59,865
- Yeah.

558
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:04,340
Yes.

559
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:06,071
- All right.

560
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:09,274
Let's go.

561
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:13,683
- I mean, it's like she's so
on the outside of this group.

562
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,187
It is a suicide.

563
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:17,688
- Hi, honey. I'm sorry.

564
00:26:17,723 --> 00:26:19,657
You were right, okay?

565
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:21,454
So I'm gonna go.

566
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:22,653
<i>- Who's that in the background?</i>

567
00:26:22,694 --> 00:26:25,094
<i>- Don't worry about it.</i>

568
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,859
- Is that fucking dickface fuck?

569
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:28,389
<i>- Okay, honey, I'm gonna go.</i>

570
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:29,900
All right,
so tomorrow's Tuesday.

571
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:32,335
I'll talk to you then.

572
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:40,277
- Good job, sweetie.

573
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:42,542
That's my little man up there.

574
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:44,173
- He is so cute.

575
00:26:44,216 --> 00:26:45,706
- He is a trip.

576
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:49,585
- You ever feel like...

577
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:51,111
- What?

578
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:55,752
- I don't know, like,
you don't have the words?

579
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:57,125
- Sure.

580
00:26:57,162 --> 00:26:58,686
- I don't know.

581
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,027
Never mind.

582
00:27:00,065 --> 00:27:02,295
- You have to find out
who you are

583
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:06,498
outside of who
you wish you were

584
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:08,733
or who someone else
wants you to be.

585
00:27:08,774 --> 00:27:11,265
Tolan, wait your turn.

586
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:15,508
Badass.

587
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:18,141
Oh, God, my neck is killing me.

588
00:27:18,183 --> 00:27:19,411
- Here.

589
00:27:19,451 --> 00:27:21,146
- Mm.

590
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:25,646
- I can't take this anymore.

591
00:27:25,691 --> 00:27:28,023
Let's go, Luke.

592
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,722
- Emma, can you
give us a minute?

593
00:27:30,762 --> 00:27:34,095
I'll meet you in the car.

594
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:45,575
You ever see him?

595
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,202
- See him?

596
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:52,842
- Yeah, I mean, like,
see him in other people.

597
00:27:52,884 --> 00:27:54,511
- Do you?

598
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:58,250
- Every day.

599
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:04,126
- Sometimes
I see him in you.

600
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:07,825
- It's gonna be okay.

601
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:10,198
- How do you know?

602
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:21,069
- Hold-
can we hold, please?

603
00:28:21,113 --> 00:28:23,172
No, no, it's really good.

604
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:25,775
Can we just try it again?

605
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:26,875
It's good, it's good.

606
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:29,352
Let's just try it again.

607
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:30,787
- I don't think the beard
is working.

608
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:31,846
- No, no,
the beard's good.

609
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,448
The beard's really good.

610
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:36,222
It just needs a little more-
like you've been waiting for it.

611
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:37,228
You know what I mean?

612
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:39,457
And less trepidatious.

613
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:41,329
- Like, so I'm a little bit
more aggressive.

614
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:42,765
- A little more gung ho
for it, yeah.

615
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:43,927
- Okay.

616
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:45,334
- You know what I mean?
That's good.

617
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,338
And can we try again?

618
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:49,306
And can we put like a blue
in here or something?

619
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:50,308
We can see what that does.

620
00:28:50,342 --> 00:28:52,037
It just feels a little warm.

621
00:28:52,077 --> 00:28:53,567
Are you guys good?

622
00:28:53,612 --> 00:28:54,806
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

623
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:58,646
- All right, let's try it again.

624
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:09,584
- Hey, Zo.

625
00:29:09,628 --> 00:29:10,595
You smoke?

626
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:14,065
- No.
You know, cancer.

627
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:15,066
- Oh, thanks, yeah.

628
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,590
I almost forgot about that.

629
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:21,595
Hey, you want get a drink,
talk about the show?

630
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,629
- I shouldn't.

631
00:29:22,674 --> 00:29:23,800
I feel like
I'm getting sick.

632
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:25,309
- No, come on,
it'd be good, really.

633
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:27,709
We should figure some stuff out.
- I mean, I'm not getting sick.

634
00:29:27,746 --> 00:29:30,010
I neti pot daily,
or at least every other day.

635
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:32,073
- Actually I'm not asking.

636
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:35,814
I am taking you out
for a drink.

637
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:36,821
- Oh.

638
00:29:36,855 --> 00:29:40,382
- Yeah.

639
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:47,596
<i>- Hey, It's Zoe.</i>

640
00:29:47,632 --> 00:29:50,965
<i>Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.</i>

641
00:29:53,004 --> 00:29:54,369
- She has to know.

642
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:57,500
She has to know that
that's what he's saying.

643
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,874
- I think that
deep down she knows,

644
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:02,607
but that, like, because she is
so controlled,

645
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:03,807
she doesn't know she knows.

646
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:05,146
Do you know what I mean?

647
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:06,775
- That's fine,
but as long as that breaks,

648
00:30:06,818 --> 00:30:09,286
as long as in the moment
he sees that she understands

649
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:13,018
what he's saying to her
and that she releases to him,

650
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:14,525
then we're good.

651
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,459
He's not saying, you know,
"You're gonna be okay"

652
00:30:16,495 --> 00:30:18,429
because he's gonna
take care of her

653
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:20,328
or he's gonna, like,
protect her or whatever.

654
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:21,798
He's saying,
"You're gonna be okay

655
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:27,931
"because I am gonna hurt you,
but that's what you need.

656
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:30,669
And you will survive."

657
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:34,167
- Okay, yeah, I mean,
I get that.

658
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:35,543
- So we need submission.

659
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,048
We need you to give yourself
to me,

660
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,641
or we're nowhere.

661
00:30:39,684 --> 00:30:40,651
The moment is-

662
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:43,210
- I think she does
in the moment.

663
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:47,954
- Well, I'm not getting it.

664
00:30:47,993 --> 00:30:51,759
- Okay.

665
00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:56,324
- You're gonna be okay.

666
00:30:56,368 --> 00:31:00,395
- How do you know?

667
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:20,483
- Uh-huh.

668
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:21,492
Right?

669
00:31:21,526 --> 00:31:22,493
- Yeah.

670
00:31:26,331 --> 00:31:28,629
- Fuck.

671
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:29,634
That was good.

672
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:31,727
- Yeah.

673
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,896
That was the scene.

674
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:34,405
- Could I get a shot
of tequila please?

675
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:39,136
- Hi, honey.
I'm sorry.

676
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:40,667
I was just-
I couldn't hear the phone.

677
00:31:40,712 --> 00:31:42,373
So do you want to come over?

678
00:31:42,414 --> 00:31:43,711
I'm just hailing a cab.

679
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:45,579
- Um, no.

680
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:47,414
<i>- Why not?
- I'm sorry.</i>

681
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:49,386
I have nothing to say
to you, Zoe.

682
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:51,685
- Um, what's your problem?

683
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:54,590
- Well, let's just say
I'm a little irate.

684
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:55,684
- Can you be a little irate?

685
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:56,751
<i>- It's an on day.</i>

686
00:31:56,795 --> 00:31:58,285
You said that we were
gonna hang out.

687
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,298
I've been sitting here
waiting for you.

688
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:01,299
- I'm sorry.

689
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,300
I was just with the cast.

690
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:03,494
We were just bonding.

691
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:05,264
- Okay, well, you could have
invited me.

692
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:07,828
- Well, we said we were going
to be independent.

693
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:09,271
<i>- God, dude,
I don't want to hang out</i>

694
00:32:09,307 --> 00:32:10,934
with a lame bunch of actors
anyway!

695
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:11,943
<i>- Okay, you need to</i>

696
00:32:11,977 --> 00:32:13,444
just calm the fuck down

697
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:15,275
and talk to me like an adult
in a normal voice.

698
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:16,780
<i>- Don't fucking tell me</i>

699
00:32:16,815 --> 00:32:18,976
to calm down when you've been
ignoring me all day, okay?

700
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:25,449
- Honey, you are reading
too much into this.

701
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:28,482
- Well, you're not giving me
much to work with, Mom.

702
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:29,788
- What do you want me
to tell you?

703
00:32:29,828 --> 00:32:31,318
We're good people.

704
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:32,955
We're decent to one another.

705
00:32:32,998 --> 00:32:34,124
That's it.

706
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:35,996
- Yeah, but that's not it.

707
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:37,467
There's so much more to it.

708
00:32:37,502 --> 00:32:38,469
It's like, why-

709
00:32:38,503 --> 00:32:40,971
- Okay, Zoe,
did it ever dawn on you

710
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:44,965
that maybe sometimes
I don't want to talk?

711
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:22,573
- Good night, Mama.

712
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:25,048
I love you.

713
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:27,278
- Will you lock up for me,
honey?

714
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:31,278
- Yeah.

715
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:55,202
- Oh, God, I'm a douche bag.

716
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:38,152
- Why is my stuff
all over the place?

717
00:34:38,189 --> 00:34:39,747
- I don't know.

718
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:42,521
Were you out with Turner?

719
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,994
- Honey, this isn't healthy,
okay?

720
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:47,293
Whatever's happening here,
this isn't like-

721
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:49,562
- I just want to know
what you were doing.

722
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:50,863
- I don't have to tell you.
It's our day off.

723
00:34:50,902 --> 00:34:52,802
- I know it's our day off,
but I want to know.

724
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:54,099
- For fuck's sake, Daryl.

725
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,538
- I just want to know
what he gives you

726
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:56,665
that I don't give you.

727
00:34:56,708 --> 00:35:00,166
- He's not there
all the fucking time!

728
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:29,537
I was at my mom's.

729
00:35:34,512 --> 00:35:36,207
I just don't understand

730
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:40,775
how two people
can go from being in a unit

731
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:44,346
to just being...

732
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:45,583
alone.

733
00:35:48,293 --> 00:35:54,095
This is why I'll never work
in these things,

734
00:35:54,132 --> 00:35:58,569
'cause I know that they're just
gonna end in disaster.

735
00:35:58,603 --> 00:36:00,696
- That's not true.

736
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:05,402
- D, whose breakup lasts
as long as the relationship?

737
00:36:05,443 --> 00:36:09,072
- I don't know, ours.

738
00:36:09,113 --> 00:36:12,139
- And lesbians.

739
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:37,731
- I think I've earned
a nice pastrami on rye.

740
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:39,868
- Isn't that fatty?

741
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:42,402
- You don't have to tell her
everything I eat.

742
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:46,543
- I don't tell Mom everything.

743
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:50,076
If I drown, don't save me.

744
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:52,248
- Come on, let's go.

745
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:02,600
How's Zoe?

746
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:04,067
- Eh.

747
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:06,036
- You know we like her.

748
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,197
- Yeah.

749
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:10,366
- But we like you more.

750
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:11,807
- Look, I don't want Mom
to know.

751
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:14,744
Okay, she doesn't get it.

752
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:17,373
So please don't tell her.

753
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:19,280
- Then I'm ordering dessert.

754
00:37:25,623 --> 00:37:27,318
- Do you ever see him?

755
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:28,518
- See him?

756
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,857
- Yeah, I mean, like,

757
00:37:29,894 --> 00:37:31,919
do you ever see him
in other people?

758
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:34,523
- Do you?

759
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:37,399
- Every day.

760
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:40,029
- Sometimes I see him in you.

761
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:45,039
- It's gonna be okay.

762
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:02,793
- Oh, my God.
Congratulations!

763
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:05,660
- Thank you.

764
00:38:05,697 --> 00:38:07,597
- Oh, you were so terrific.

765
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:09,930
You know that scene,
you made me cry.

766
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:11,435
Tears were coming down.

767
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:13,198
It was just so wonderful
of you.

768
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:16,570
- And then another crazy band
came out to take over for him.

769
00:38:16,608 --> 00:38:18,542
- Who's the crazy band?

770
00:38:18,576 --> 00:38:21,340
- Uh, Capital One I think,
Capital Years?

771
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:23,574
- But anyway, I'm gonna run,
'cause we have to go to the-

772
00:38:23,615 --> 00:38:24,877
- I'm gonna come
and see it again.

773
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:26,213
- Oh, you are?
- I really loved it.

774
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,241
I really, really loved it.
I loved it.

775
00:38:28,286 --> 00:38:30,686
- Thank you so much for coming.
- You were just so wonderful.

776
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:33,623
- Okay, bye.

777
00:38:33,658 --> 00:38:34,682
- Yeah, but I love his music.

778
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:37,024
You saw him at Warsaw?

779
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:38,187
- At Warsaw in Brooklyn, yeah.

780
00:38:38,229 --> 00:38:39,958
- Nice.

781
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:40,965
- I like your style, man.

782
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:42,967
This is a cool coat.

783
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:43,990
- Thanks.

784
00:38:44,035 --> 00:38:45,002
- Is it vintage?

785
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:46,298
- Yeah.

786
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:48,897
- Yeah!
Me too.

787
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,430
- Hi.
- Hey, guys.

788
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:52,739
- That's the new Meryl Streep.

789
00:38:52,777 --> 00:38:54,210
Jewish, though.

790
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:55,212
- Very Jewish.

791
00:38:55,246 --> 00:38:58,215
Okay, should we go to the party?

792
00:38:58,249 --> 00:39:00,649
- Yeah, sure, after you.

793
00:39:00,685 --> 00:39:03,449
And you.

794
00:39:05,623 --> 00:39:07,113
What do you want me to say?

795
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:08,352
She started talking to me.

796
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:09,621
We were having a drink.

797
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:11,390
- I'm sure you two
had a lot to talk about.

798
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:12,794
She looked really smart.

799
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,797
- Actually, we did.

800
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:14,889
She knew all about art.

801
00:39:14,932 --> 00:39:16,365
- She knows nothing!

802
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:18,665
- Okay, you're acting like
a fucking psychopath right now,

803
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:19,761
and I'm leaving.

804
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:20,862
- Oh, really?

805
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:21,872
You're gonna leave now?

806
00:39:21,906 --> 00:39:22,873
All right, go.

807
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:24,898
Go ahead.
Fucking baby.

808
00:39:24,942 --> 00:39:26,068
And thank you very much.

809
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,168
You ruined my fucking night.

810
00:39:27,211 --> 00:39:28,542
- I ruined your night?

811
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:30,479
I'm sorry, where does it say
treat your boyfriend

812
00:39:30,515 --> 00:39:31,504
like the cater waiter?

813
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:32,982
- I'm sorry, where does it say

814
00:39:33,017 --> 00:39:35,747
go talk to the only fucking
long-legged bitch in the room?

815
00:39:35,787 --> 00:39:36,981
- Okay,
what do you want me to do?

816
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:38,921
Just stand around and not
fucking talk to anybody?

817
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:40,082
- Yeah.
- I'm socializing.

818
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:41,751
It doesn't mean anything.
- Oh, bullshit.

819
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:42,760
You wanted to fuck her.

820
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:44,261
- You're just projecting.

821
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:45,922
That's just projection.

822
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:47,191
- You know what, go ahead,

823
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:48,528
'cause you and me,
we're done fucking.

824
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:50,796
- Fine.
- Fine.

825
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:52,234
Hey, go buy her a sandwich.

826
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,431
I'm sure she's starving.

827
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:06,282
- Well, it seems you two
are going at it

828
00:40:06,317 --> 00:40:07,750
for every little thing.

829
00:40:07,785 --> 00:40:10,618
- Well, not seeing each other
at all is worse than fighting.

830
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:11,622
I mean, don't you think?

831
00:40:11,656 --> 00:40:13,317
- Fuck if I know.
These are cute.

832
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:14,790
- Yeah, get those.

833
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:16,555
- Mm-hmm.
If you're a mime.

834
00:40:16,594 --> 00:40:18,084
All right.

835
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:19,892
So how are the folks?

836
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:21,228
- They're good, you know.

837
00:40:21,265 --> 00:40:22,926
It's not a marriage I'd want,

838
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:25,128
but I'm not sure I've seen
a marriage that I'd want.

839
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:26,136
I don't know.

840
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,637
What do you think
about marriage?

841
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:30,072
Do you think it's an institution
that actually works nowadays?

842
00:40:30,108 --> 00:40:31,234
I feel like-

843
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:34,904
- Okay, Daryl,
you got a lot of questions.

844
00:40:34,946 --> 00:40:36,106
What do you think about this?

845
00:40:36,147 --> 00:40:37,774
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is hot.

846
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:39,373
- Really?
You know, I'm honored, honey,

847
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:41,214
that you want to talk to me
about marriage.

848
00:40:41,252 --> 00:40:44,016
Do you talk to your own mom
like this?

849
00:40:44,055 --> 00:40:45,181
- Uh, kind of.

850
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:46,690
I mean, not really.
I don't know.

851
00:40:46,724 --> 00:40:48,624
I mean, something's kind
of changed between us.

852
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:51,526
I'm afraid she's gonna judge me
or something.

853
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:53,325
- Oh, honey, we're all afraid
of being judged.

854
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:56,231
I'll tell you that much.

855
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:57,461
I don't know.
What do you think?

856
00:40:57,502 --> 00:40:58,469
- That is hot.

857
00:40:58,503 --> 00:40:59,697
You could go to the club
in that.

858
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:01,034
- Really?

859
00:41:01,072 --> 00:41:03,302
'Cause I think
it looks like I'm nursing.

860
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:04,467
- I think it's nice.

861
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:05,999
- Some baby would be very happy.

862
00:41:06,043 --> 00:41:07,340
These are nice jugs.

863
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:08,868
- Here, try this.

864
00:41:08,913 --> 00:41:11,814
- Okay, I got such a gut.

865
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:12,816
- What? No, you don't.

866
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,147
Gut's the new black.

867
00:41:14,185 --> 00:41:16,176
- Look at all the fat hanging
out over the underpants.

868
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,244
- Stop it.

869
00:41:17,288 --> 00:41:19,586
Look at your abs.
You got great abs.

870
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:21,819
- I got to look hot, baby,
hot for my date tonight.

871
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:23,053
- All right, so tell me,
tell me.

872
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:24,220
I want some details.

873
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:26,196
What's his income, build,
star sign?

874
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,289
- I met him at the food co-op.

875
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:30,459
We were both bagging together,

876
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:32,765
and he's into woodworking,
and he's married.

877
00:41:32,804 --> 00:41:35,295
- Oh, sounds like a keeper.

878
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:36,636
- You know what?

879
00:41:36,674 --> 00:41:38,198
There's a lot that
you don't know about.

880
00:41:38,242 --> 00:41:40,676
Ever hear of polyamory?

881
00:41:40,711 --> 00:41:41,803
- What's that, swingers?

882
00:41:41,846 --> 00:41:43,006
- Kinda sorta.

883
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:44,537
- Oh, I'm gonna turn around
right now.

884
00:41:44,582 --> 00:41:45,571
- Never mind.

885
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:48,084
Come on.

886
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:51,577
Come on, baby, we're family.

887
00:41:51,622 --> 00:41:53,681
Yeah, I don't know, honey.

888
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:55,214
At least he's working.

889
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:56,556
Here, zip me.

890
00:41:56,594 --> 00:41:57,561
- Okay.

891
00:41:57,595 --> 00:41:58,755
- It's slim pickin's out there.

892
00:41:58,796 --> 00:42:00,093
You know that.

893
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:02,065
I've only had three hits
this month on JDate.

894
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:03,691
All of them were octogenarians.

895
00:42:03,734 --> 00:42:06,498
- Oh, come here.

896
00:42:06,537 --> 00:42:07,504
Don't worry.

897
00:42:07,538 --> 00:42:08,630
I know some hot young guys.

898
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:09,640
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

899
00:42:09,674 --> 00:42:11,403
- Like you?
- Like me.

900
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:13,000
- All right, you know what?

901
00:42:13,044 --> 00:42:14,568
You and Zoe
better stay together.

902
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:15,943
I really like you.

903
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,208
Fuck her.

904
00:42:17,248 --> 00:42:18,840
What do you think?

905
00:42:18,883 --> 00:42:20,145
- I think you look hot.

906
00:42:20,184 --> 00:42:21,742
- Okay, I look like
Shirley Temple.

907
00:42:21,786 --> 00:42:22,912
- No, you don't.

908
00:42:22,954 --> 00:42:25,184
- I look like
the Goodyear blimp.

909
00:42:25,223 --> 00:42:27,248
I look like Zsa Zsa Gabor
post-stroke.

910
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:28,258
Take it off.

911
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:30,317
Unzip me.

912
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:32,420
Love yourself, love yourself,
love yourself.

913
00:42:32,463 --> 00:42:35,057
- How many wives does that guy
have right there?

914
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:38,125
- I told you
it's not about polygamy.

915
00:42:38,169 --> 00:42:39,796
It's polyamory.

916
00:42:39,837 --> 00:42:41,099
Okay, It's not about possession.

917
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:42,696
It's about love and freedom.

918
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,798
- Okay.

919
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:44,899
- That guy's really cute.

920
00:42:44,942 --> 00:42:47,433
- Let's go talk to some people.

921
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:49,503
- Okay, just act cool.

922
00:42:49,547 --> 00:42:52,141
Come on, listen and learn.

923
00:42:52,183 --> 00:42:54,481
Hey, how are you?

924
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:57,544
- How long have you been
polyamorous?

925
00:42:57,588 --> 00:42:59,146
- As long as we've been
together.

926
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,455
- Well, Matt was
in a relationship

927
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:04,188
when we started
our relationship.

928
00:43:04,228 --> 00:43:06,458
- I mean, we all have
so much baggage,

929
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:08,488
whether it's, you know,
our personal insecurities

930
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:11,262
or fear of abandonment.

931
00:43:11,302 --> 00:43:13,236
And then we live in this,
you know,

932
00:43:13,271 --> 00:43:16,399
monogamy-centrist culture
that just reinforces

933
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,907
all that fear mentality.

934
00:43:17,942 --> 00:43:21,969
- Like, haven't you ever wanted
to be with someone else?

935
00:43:22,013 --> 00:43:23,037
- What are you, Jewish?

936
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,047
- Yeah.

937
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:26,015
Christian?

938
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,074
Nice.

939
00:43:27,118 --> 00:43:28,142
- I like Jewish guys.

940
00:43:28,185 --> 00:43:29,447
- Oh, cool.

941
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:31,284
- I generally get along better
with Jewish guys.

942
00:43:31,322 --> 00:43:32,414
- I'm a sculptor.

943
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:33,650
- Sculptor?
- Yeah.

944
00:43:33,691 --> 00:43:35,556
- Do you-what kind of material
do you work with?

945
00:43:35,593 --> 00:43:36,617
- Blood.

946
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:38,720
- You sculpt blood.

947
00:43:38,763 --> 00:43:39,991
Do you freeze the blood?

948
00:43:40,031 --> 00:43:41,055
- That's absolutely right.

949
00:43:41,098 --> 00:43:42,190
How do you know that?

950
00:43:42,233 --> 00:43:43,257
- Well, I'm educated.

951
00:43:43,301 --> 00:43:44,700
- But you know I mean?

952
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:46,794
It's like-it's like-
because then otherwise sex

953
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:49,032
becomes like there's
a primary zone

954
00:43:49,073 --> 00:43:50,597
in which it's morally okay.

955
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:53,303
And then there's
this other exciting place

956
00:43:53,344 --> 00:43:55,744
where it's exciting
'cause it's not morally okay.

957
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,180
But then that means the person
you're engaging with

958
00:43:58,215 --> 00:43:59,614
you're having
some judgment about,

959
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,413
like it's immoral, you know.

960
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:03,443
And so you bring your shame
into it.

961
00:44:03,487 --> 00:44:06,615
You know, it's like, why bring
that to somebody else?

962
00:44:06,657 --> 00:44:10,616
- Like, I just rose above
all my human nature

963
00:44:10,661 --> 00:44:15,860
and evolved like just
quantum leap from the cave days.

964
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,390
You know what I mean?

965
00:44:17,435 --> 00:44:21,269
I mean, but what I'm saying is,
that's what it takes.

966
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:26,576
- Where the hell were you?

967
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,544
- Well, hello to you too, Mom.

968
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:30,376
- No, really,
where the hell were you?

969
00:44:30,414 --> 00:44:32,348
- Out.
Hi, Dad.

970
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,350
- Hi, Daryl.

971
00:44:33,384 --> 00:44:34,817
- Call Brian.

972
00:44:34,852 --> 00:44:37,184
You know, if you won't answer
your damn cell phone,

973
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:38,654
what is the point
of paying that bill?

974
00:44:38,689 --> 00:44:39,917
- Brian, dinner.

975
00:44:39,957 --> 00:44:41,652
- I don't know, Mom.
I don't know.

976
00:44:41,692 --> 00:44:43,785
- Wow, what crawled up your ass
and died?

977
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:46,160
Hey, I want you
to look at something.

978
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:47,630
These are your bills.

979
00:44:47,665 --> 00:44:49,292
We need you to come back

980
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:51,995
from la-la land and join us
here in the real world.

981
00:44:52,036 --> 00:44:53,560
This is your student loan.

982
00:44:53,604 --> 00:44:55,094
You've got to help us out.

983
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:56,663
Oh, and this is
your new insurance card.

984
00:44:56,707 --> 00:44:57,696
Put it in your wallet.

985
00:44:57,742 --> 00:45:00,404
Brian, supper!

986
00:45:00,444 --> 00:45:01,968
- Shit, bitch,
can't a man have a minute?

987
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:03,412
- Who you calling bitch, bitch?

988
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:05,847
Snap, snap on you.

989
00:45:05,883 --> 00:45:06,941
Hey, where's Zoe?

990
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:08,349
Isn't she coming?

991
00:45:08,386 --> 00:45:09,683
- Mom, you need a haircut.

992
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,847
- Yeah, well,
you need to wash your clothes.

993
00:45:11,889 --> 00:45:13,220
Alan, tell him.

994
00:45:13,257 --> 00:45:15,384
He's gonna go to the synagogue
meet and greet

995
00:45:15,426 --> 00:45:17,394
dressed like a homeless.

996
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:22,892
Honestly.

997
00:45:22,933 --> 00:45:26,630
What's going on?

998
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:29,434
- Daryl needs a day off
from talking about his days off.

999
00:45:29,473 --> 00:45:30,997
- What?

1000
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:32,475
What's a day off?

1001
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,705
- Nothing.

1002
00:45:34,745 --> 00:45:35,973
Cops.

1003
00:45:36,013 --> 00:45:37,947
- Why can't you be gay
like your brother?

1004
00:45:37,982 --> 00:45:39,609
- Mom, please.
He doesn't have the chops.

1005
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:41,174
- Well, all right,
I'm gonna call Zoe.

1006
00:45:41,218 --> 00:45:42,185
She'll explain it.

1007
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:46,588
- Joanie, sit down.

1008
00:45:46,624 --> 00:45:50,458
- All right,
somebody talk to me.

1009
00:45:50,494 --> 00:45:52,018
- Days off, it just means
that Zoe and I

1010
00:45:52,063 --> 00:45:54,463
aren't talking to each other
or seeing each other right now.

1011
00:45:54,498 --> 00:45:56,398
- What does that mean?

1012
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:57,901
How can you work
on your relationship

1013
00:45:57,935 --> 00:46:01,336
if you're not talking or-

1014
00:46:01,372 --> 00:46:04,535
are you breaking up?

1015
00:46:04,575 --> 00:46:07,271
Did you know about this?

1016
00:46:07,311 --> 00:46:10,803
Did everybody
know about this but me?

1017
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:15,846
Okay, fine.

1018
00:46:22,093 --> 00:46:24,687
Boys' secrets.

1019
00:46:24,728 --> 00:46:26,719
- He won a Pulitzer prize?

1020
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:28,459
- Well, you know,
Daryl's a writer.

1021
00:46:28,499 --> 00:46:29,466
- No.
- Oh, yeah. Look out.

1022
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,297
- Really?
Nice.

1023
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:33,360
And what's your day job, son?

1024
00:46:33,404 --> 00:46:35,372
- Nude model.

1025
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:40,743
- Excuse me. Mort?

1026
00:46:41,946 --> 00:46:43,174
- That was nice.

1027
00:46:43,214 --> 00:46:44,511
You know there's a back door

1028
00:46:44,548 --> 00:46:46,880
in case you meet
any cute Jewish girls.

1029
00:46:46,917 --> 00:46:48,714
- Right.

1030
00:46:48,752 --> 00:46:52,882
- If you want to move on,
you got to let other people in.

1031
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,895
- Well, not necessarily,

1032
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:05,800
because it's not, you know,
in your experience,

1033
00:47:05,836 --> 00:47:09,067
nor should it be, necessarily.

1034
00:47:09,106 --> 00:47:11,040
But it's interesting.

1035
00:47:11,075 --> 00:47:13,270
- I think I'm gonna go
get a drink.

1036
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:14,277
- Oh, okay.

1037
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:15,778
- Do you want anything?

1038
00:47:15,813 --> 00:47:16,837
- No, no, thank you.

1039
00:47:16,881 --> 00:47:18,212
- Okay.

1040
00:47:18,249 --> 00:47:19,409
It was nice talking to you.

1041
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,644
- Thank you, you too.

1042
00:47:20,684 --> 00:47:23,551
- Bye.

1043
00:47:29,393 --> 00:47:30,382
- Hey.

1044
00:47:30,427 --> 00:47:31,394
- Hi.

1045
00:47:32,696 --> 00:47:34,960
- I think you're the reason
why my parents

1046
00:47:34,999 --> 00:47:36,364
made me come here tonight.

1047
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,233
- Probably.

1048
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:40,532
- Are you Ethan?

1049
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:41,731
- Oh, Daryl.

1050
00:47:46,577 --> 00:47:49,876
Do you want to maybe pretend
to be Ethan for me?

1051
00:47:49,914 --> 00:47:52,405
- Sure, you be Leticia.

1052
00:47:52,449 --> 00:47:55,646
- Word, Leticia don't
live here no mo'.

1053
00:47:55,686 --> 00:47:58,211
- Wow, you really went there.

1054
00:47:58,255 --> 00:48:00,189
- Yeah.

1055
00:48:00,224 --> 00:48:03,022
- So are you having as much fun
at this thing as I am?

1056
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:07,895
- Actually, I was gonna leave
pretty soon.

1057
00:48:07,932 --> 00:48:11,231
I'm meeting some friends
at Esperanto.

1058
00:48:11,268 --> 00:48:13,395
Do you maybe want to join?

1059
00:48:15,372 --> 00:48:17,169
- I can't.

1060
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:19,199
- Too bad.

1061
00:48:19,243 --> 00:48:20,232
I bet you're easy.

1062
00:48:20,277 --> 00:48:21,835
You know, couple drinks.

1063
00:48:21,879 --> 00:48:23,073
- You have no idea.

1064
00:48:37,261 --> 00:48:39,855
<i>- Fuckin' Amores Perros.</i>

1065
00:48:39,897 --> 00:48:41,888
Okay, continue.

1066
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:44,423
- I think it's a necessary step.

1067
00:48:44,468 --> 00:48:45,435
- Okay, fine.

1068
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:46,834
Are you gonna want
to know details?

1069
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:47,837
- No!

1070
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,304
Uh-uh.

1071
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,138
- Okay, but I think we should
probably be open.

1072
00:48:52,176 --> 00:48:54,906
- No, I don't want to
know that kind of stuff.

1073
00:48:54,945 --> 00:48:56,469
I can't handle it.

1074
00:48:56,513 --> 00:48:58,276
- Okay, let's do a practice.

1075
00:48:58,315 --> 00:49:00,112
- Okay, okay.

1076
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:01,845
- Okay, let's just say
I just went on a date

1077
00:49:01,885 --> 00:49:04,581
with my friend Halley,
and it's the next night.

1078
00:49:04,622 --> 00:49:06,089
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

1079
00:49:06,123 --> 00:49:12,619
I got to-you know, I got
to figure out my motivation.

1080
00:49:12,663 --> 00:49:13,630
Okay, ready.

1081
00:49:13,664 --> 00:49:15,723
- I think you should sit down.

1082
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:17,097
- What is it?

1083
00:49:17,134 --> 00:49:20,103
- I went on a date
with my friend Halley.

1084
00:49:20,137 --> 00:49:22,105
- Wow.

1085
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:25,108
How was it?

1086
00:49:25,142 --> 00:49:29,101
- We made out.

1087
00:49:29,146 --> 00:49:30,613
How do you feel?

1088
00:49:30,648 --> 00:49:32,275
- Um, how do I feel?

1089
00:49:32,316 --> 00:49:37,015
I feel upset.

1090
00:49:37,054 --> 00:49:39,147
- I'm sorry.
I really like her.

1091
00:49:39,189 --> 00:49:40,656
- Like, go on another date,
like her?

1092
00:49:40,691 --> 00:49:44,024
- Yeah, she's got a banging ass,
really big tits.

1093
00:49:44,061 --> 00:49:45,028
- Okay, stop.

1094
00:49:45,062 --> 00:49:46,029
Don't say that.

1095
00:49:46,063 --> 00:49:47,428
- What?
- That.

1096
00:49:47,464 --> 00:49:48,829
- Are you acting
or are you talking?

1097
00:49:48,866 --> 00:49:50,493
- Talking!
Jesus, fuck, don't say that.

1098
00:49:50,534 --> 00:49:52,001
"Oh, great ass, tits."

1099
00:49:52,036 --> 00:49:53,526
I don't want to hear
that kind of stuff.

1100
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:56,664
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1101
00:49:56,707 --> 00:49:58,732
- Do you, though?

1102
00:49:58,776 --> 00:50:01,074
- Yeah, I mean we sat
next to each other

1103
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:03,306
in Politics
and the Information Explosion.

1104
00:50:03,347 --> 00:50:07,147
She has the cutest handwriting.

1105
00:50:07,184 --> 00:50:09,550
Honey, I think
it's a necessary step.

1106
00:50:20,497 --> 00:50:21,464
- What's going on?

1107
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:22,465
Any luck?

1108
00:50:22,499 --> 00:50:25,229
- I'm not trying too hard.

1109
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:27,396
- What about that guy
right there?

1110
00:50:27,438 --> 00:50:28,564
- Who?

1111
00:50:28,605 --> 00:50:30,630
- That guy right there.

1112
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:33,401
- Oh, I don't know.

1113
00:50:33,444 --> 00:50:35,173
I have to pee.

1114
00:50:35,212 --> 00:50:36,873
- What?
Do it at his place.

1115
00:50:36,914 --> 00:50:38,472
- No.
- Come on, he's cute.

1116
00:50:38,515 --> 00:50:40,380
- You go talk to him
if you think he looks so cute.

1117
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:42,385
- Looks like he had
a good childhood.

1118
00:50:42,419 --> 00:50:45,820
He's clean-looking.

1119
00:50:45,856 --> 00:50:47,414
- I have to pee.

1120
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:49,426
- Okay, well, I think you...
go talk to him.

1121
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,757
That's what I think
you should do.

1122
00:50:50,794 --> 00:50:51,988
- I'll go pee on him.

1123
00:50:52,029 --> 00:50:53,519
- Yeah, go pee on him.
- We'll get kinky.

1124
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:54,826
- Go ahead.
Go pee on him.

1125
00:50:54,865 --> 00:50:56,662
- Wouldn't that make you happy?
- Yeah, it would.

1126
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,894
- Fuckin' pervert.
Excuse me.

1127
00:51:06,744 --> 00:51:08,507
- Hello.

1128
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:10,911
- And hello.

1129
00:51:10,948 --> 00:51:12,040
- Fancy meeting you here.

1130
00:51:12,082 --> 00:51:13,049
- I know.

1131
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:17,110
Right here.

1132
00:51:17,154 --> 00:51:18,121
- So what do you do?

1133
00:51:18,155 --> 00:51:19,588
- I'm an actor.

1134
00:51:19,623 --> 00:51:20,715
- Oh, yeah?

1135
00:51:20,758 --> 00:51:23,591
I owe that guy over there
ten bucks.

1136
00:51:23,627 --> 00:51:25,959
- Damn.

1137
00:51:25,996 --> 00:51:27,258
Is that your boyfriend?

1138
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:28,855
- No, mm-mm.

1139
00:51:28,899 --> 00:51:30,093
He's gay.

1140
00:51:30,134 --> 00:51:31,601
- Oh, yeah, I see that.

1141
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:32,602
- Yeah.

1142
00:51:32,636 --> 00:51:34,797
What are you drinking?

1143
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:36,135
- Oran vodka.

1144
00:51:36,173 --> 00:51:37,538
- Whoa.

1145
00:51:37,574 --> 00:51:38,939
A little bit gay.

1146
00:51:38,976 --> 00:51:40,773
- Is this like your A game?

1147
00:51:40,811 --> 00:51:42,039
'Cause it's-

1148
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,377
- No, no, I'm just riffing.

1149
00:51:44,415 --> 00:51:46,747
- Are you?

1150
00:51:46,784 --> 00:51:54,122
# Anticipation driving me
out of my mind #

1151
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:56,786
# I've got to hurry #

1152
00:51:56,827 --> 00:52:01,594
# 'Cause I know I haven't
got much time #

1153
00:52:01,632 --> 00:52:07,798
# To find who you really are #

1154
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:09,328
- Solo.

1155
00:52:09,373 --> 00:52:12,342
- # I've got to get closer #

1156
00:52:12,376 --> 00:52:17,746
# 'Cause now you feel
so far away from me #

1157
00:52:17,781 --> 00:52:18,907
- Whoo!

1158
00:52:18,949 --> 00:52:20,780
- Whoo!

1159
00:52:20,818 --> 00:52:22,809
- Yeah.

1160
00:52:22,853 --> 00:52:23,820
- Nice!

1161
00:52:23,854 --> 00:52:24,821
- Oh, hey!

1162
00:52:24,855 --> 00:52:25,822
- Karaoke!

1163
00:52:25,856 --> 00:52:28,586
- Ah, right.

1164
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:30,456
- Very nicely done, man.

1165
00:52:30,494 --> 00:52:33,054
- He was in an a capella group
in college.

1166
00:52:33,096 --> 00:52:36,759
- Oh, yeah, you can tell.

1167
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,995
- All right.

1168
00:52:39,036 --> 00:52:40,697
Yeah, you want to sing
another one?

1169
00:52:40,737 --> 00:52:41,704
- Yeah.

1170
00:52:41,738 --> 00:52:43,569
- You guys want another round?

1171
00:52:43,607 --> 00:52:44,574
- Yeah, yeah.

1172
00:52:44,608 --> 00:52:46,007
- Yeah?

1173
00:52:46,043 --> 00:52:47,101
You good?

1174
00:52:47,144 --> 00:52:48,611
- Sure, yeah.

1175
00:52:48,645 --> 00:52:49,612
- One more round.

1176
00:53:05,028 --> 00:53:06,825
What's wrong, little baby?

1177
00:53:06,864 --> 00:53:08,764
Your pussy hurt?

1178
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:09,925
You need a tampon?

1179
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:12,231
- Okay, I feel very
uncomfortable right now.

1180
00:53:12,269 --> 00:53:13,930
- Well, you encouraged me, D,

1181
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:15,871
so I don't know
what to tell you.

1182
00:53:15,906 --> 00:53:17,464
- I know I encouraged you
earlier,

1183
00:53:17,508 --> 00:53:19,032
but now, if you cared-

1184
00:53:19,076 --> 00:53:20,236
- No, now?

1185
00:53:20,277 --> 00:53:21,471
Now?

1186
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:24,572
No, brother man, no now.

1187
00:53:24,615 --> 00:53:28,415
We had a meeting in a kitchen,

1188
00:53:28,452 --> 00:53:31,319
and now we're here.

1189
00:53:31,355 --> 00:53:33,255
- Well, I'm re-evaluating.

1190
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:34,848
- You can't just, you know,

1191
00:53:34,892 --> 00:53:36,792
make these decisions
on your own.

1192
00:53:36,827 --> 00:53:38,226
We have to make them together.

1193
00:53:38,262 --> 00:53:39,320
We made a decision.

1194
00:53:39,363 --> 00:53:41,092
- Okay, I want to fucking
leave now.

1195
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:43,099
- Then leave.

1196
00:53:44,868 --> 00:53:46,631
Oh, oh.

1197
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:47,864
- Almost couldn't find you guys.

1198
00:53:49,573 --> 00:53:53,270
- Drinks here and here.

1199
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:56,768
- Hey.

1200
00:53:56,813 --> 00:54:01,443
- And I think Zoe
is choosing for Daryl.

1201
00:54:01,485 --> 00:54:02,645
- Oh, no.

1202
00:54:02,686 --> 00:54:04,745
- Ladies choice!

1203
00:54:04,788 --> 00:54:06,688
- I'm gonna head out.
- What?

1204
00:54:06,723 --> 00:54:08,190
- I got to wake up early.

1205
00:54:08,225 --> 00:54:09,590
I got a lot of work to do.

1206
00:54:09,626 --> 00:54:11,355
So you guys should stay.

1207
00:54:11,395 --> 00:54:12,919
You guys should totally stay.

1208
00:54:12,963 --> 00:54:14,328
- We will stay.

1209
00:54:14,364 --> 00:54:16,559
- Yeah, we're staying.
- Yeah, man.

1210
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,567
- No question.

1211
00:54:17,601 --> 00:54:19,330
- d We're gonna get closer d

1212
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:20,495
- Hold on one second, okay?

1213
00:54:20,537 --> 00:54:23,233
- Yeah, I got-

1214
00:54:23,273 --> 00:54:29,109
I got something for you.

1215
00:54:32,816 --> 00:54:34,909
- Look, I don't want to do this

1216
00:54:34,952 --> 00:54:36,283
if you're really
not okay with it.

1217
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:41,758
- Yeah, you do.

1218
00:55:14,224 --> 00:55:16,192
- Here.

1219
00:55:16,226 --> 00:55:18,217
- Thank you.

1220
00:55:33,644 --> 00:55:36,977
So did you think my article
was shit?

1221
00:55:37,014 --> 00:55:40,381
- Daryl, no.

1222
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:44,553
- I just wanted to impress you.

1223
00:55:44,588 --> 00:55:45,953
- You did.

1224
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:49,686
I actually-

1225
00:55:49,726 --> 00:55:55,426
I just got an email
from a friend.

1226
00:55:55,465 --> 00:55:56,454
An opportunity.

1227
00:56:47,784 --> 00:56:49,877
So did we just break the rules?

1228
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,354
- Nah, we're supposed to.

1229
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:54,914
- What man wouldn't kill
for that responsibility?

1230
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:00,289
Exactly, and try new things
and be independent.

1231
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:02,127
- It's sweet.

1232
00:57:02,165 --> 00:57:03,757
It is.

1233
00:57:13,076 --> 00:57:16,773
- So why am I so miserable?

1234
00:57:16,813 --> 00:57:20,442
- Look, we all want to believe
in a love that sustains itself.

1235
00:57:20,484 --> 00:57:22,076
But it's bullshit.

1236
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:23,416
Believe me.

1237
00:57:23,453 --> 00:57:25,546
I've done impeccable research.

1238
00:57:28,692 --> 00:57:32,628
- Look, I don't know if it's
the right time or whatever,

1239
00:57:32,662 --> 00:57:35,290
but that job?

1240
00:57:35,332 --> 00:57:38,790
It's in Vancouver.

1241
00:57:53,283 --> 00:57:54,614
- I know.

1242
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:58,849
- There's no treatment
for that, man.

1243
00:57:58,889 --> 00:58:00,220
- What's up?

1244
00:58:00,257 --> 00:58:01,952
- Oh, what up?

1245
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:04,426
- Okay, listen.

1246
00:58:04,461 --> 00:58:05,758
The clap is Chlamydia.

1247
00:58:05,796 --> 00:58:07,229
- No, the clap is gonorrhea.

1248
00:58:07,264 --> 00:58:08,697
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

1249
00:58:08,732 --> 00:58:10,723
- Gonorrhea is the burn.
Gonorrhea burns.

1250
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:11,756
- Yeah.

1251
00:58:11,802 --> 00:58:12,791
- What's the drip?

1252
00:58:12,836 --> 00:58:13,803
- Yeah, what is the drip?

1253
00:58:13,837 --> 00:58:14,804
- I have no idea.

1254
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:16,328
- What's the third main STD?

1255
00:58:16,373 --> 00:58:17,840
- Syphilis.

1256
00:58:21,978 --> 00:58:23,445
- Hold this.

1257
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,447
I'll be right back.

1258
00:58:24,481 --> 00:58:27,279
I'm gonna go get something.

1259
00:58:31,521 --> 00:58:34,718
- Who the fuck is that?

1260
00:58:34,758 --> 00:58:35,816
- Nothing.

1261
00:58:35,859 --> 00:58:37,759
- You just made out
with his face.

1262
00:58:37,794 --> 00:58:39,455
- I'm not getting close enough
to find out,

1263
00:58:39,496 --> 00:58:41,430
but I'm just gonna go
with the clap.

1264
00:58:41,464 --> 00:58:42,761
- Why don't you go talk to her?

1265
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,266
- Why doesn't Daryl
go talk to her?

1266
00:58:44,301 --> 00:58:45,359
- Me?
- Yeah.

1267
00:58:45,402 --> 00:58:46,699
- Why doesn't Daryl
go talk to her?

1268
00:58:46,736 --> 00:58:48,169
- Why doesn't Daryl
go dance with her?

1269
00:58:48,205 --> 00:58:49,763
- You get your head
in the game, son.

1270
00:58:49,806 --> 00:58:52,502
- I saw him nine days ago.

1271
00:58:52,542 --> 00:58:54,134
And it's like nothing.

1272
00:58:54,177 --> 00:58:57,578
It's like-it's just kind of-
he's somewhere.

1273
00:58:57,614 --> 00:59:00,105
He's there, but he's not here.

1274
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:02,380
I know that he's in my vicinity.

1275
00:59:02,419 --> 00:59:03,386
Do you know what I mean?

1276
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,980
I think about him constantly.

1277
00:59:06,022 --> 00:59:07,751
- You have dirt on your face.

1278
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:09,019
- What?

1279
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:11,459
Don't touch my face.

1280
00:59:14,865 --> 00:59:16,093
- # You can't come #

1281
00:59:16,132 --> 00:59:19,761
# Even shadows need to see #

1282
01:00:16,393 --> 01:00:19,885
- # Well, don't you say
that you can't come #

1283
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:23,422
# Well, don't you say
that you can't come #

1284
01:00:23,466 --> 01:00:25,559
# Even shadows need to see #

1285
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:52,782
- Oh...

1286
01:01:52,822 --> 01:01:55,416
wow.

1287
01:01:59,396 --> 01:02:01,489
I should-

1288
01:02:01,531 --> 01:02:04,728
I guess I should probably
get out of here.

1289
01:02:04,768 --> 01:02:06,861
- There's like beer
in the fridge and stuff

1290
01:02:06,903 --> 01:02:08,427
if you want to have a drink
or something.

1291
01:02:08,471 --> 01:02:10,496
- Oh, yeah?

1292
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:13,100
Cool.

1293
01:02:19,649 --> 01:02:21,139
Nice.

1294
01:02:21,184 --> 01:02:22,276
Thanks.

1295
01:02:24,387 --> 01:02:25,911
That was-

1296
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:29,958
Hey, let's not lose that.

1297
01:02:29,993 --> 01:02:31,051
All right?

1298
01:02:31,094 --> 01:02:34,222
I mean, eight shows a week,
you know?

1299
01:02:34,264 --> 01:02:37,825
- Yeah, um-

1300
01:02:37,867 --> 01:02:38,834
- I'm out.

1301
01:02:46,342 --> 01:02:47,468
<i>- All right, now we're gonna do</i>

1302
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,410
some partnering up
for some balancing.

1303
01:02:49,446 --> 01:02:51,744
So we're gonna do tuladandasana
and a balancing stick pose.

1304
01:02:51,781 --> 01:02:53,646
So I want you to find a partner.

1305
01:02:53,683 --> 01:02:55,082
Walk over towards your partner.

1306
01:02:55,118 --> 01:02:56,346
Yeah, yeah, find a partner,

1307
01:02:56,386 --> 01:02:57,944
and we're gonna do
balancing stick pose.

1308
01:02:57,987 --> 01:02:59,477
So one of you is going
to do the posture.

1309
01:02:59,522 --> 01:03:02,286
And of you is going to spot
your partner.

1310
01:03:02,325 --> 01:03:05,658
All right, arms up over
your head, hands in prayer.

1311
01:03:05,695 --> 01:03:08,129
Stretch up, take a big step
forward on your right leg.

1312
01:03:08,164 --> 01:03:10,689
Lock your right leg,
point your left toes, and go.

1313
01:03:10,733 --> 01:03:13,224
Bring your body down
parallel to the floor.

1314
01:03:13,269 --> 01:03:15,464
Point the toes back,
stretching the arms forward,

1315
01:03:15,505 --> 01:03:16,472
Keep the legs strong.

1316
01:03:19,609 --> 01:03:21,975
- Okay, let's go ahead
and come out of the posture.

1317
01:03:26,049 --> 01:03:28,745
- Is everything okay?

1318
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:32,585
- I think she's-
she's crying or something.

1319
01:03:32,622 --> 01:03:35,523
- It's not, it's not you.

1320
01:03:35,558 --> 01:03:37,788
- I know this is
a really emotional pose.

1321
01:03:37,827 --> 01:03:39,294
It's one of the hip openers.

1322
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:41,820
You're really releasing a lot
of emotion and stress,

1323
01:03:41,865 --> 01:03:44,891
so it's really normal to have
this kind of reaction.

1324
01:03:50,273 --> 01:03:51,968
- Thank you.

1325
01:03:52,008 --> 01:03:54,476
- All right, guys, so we're
gonna move into another posture,

1326
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:55,876
so we're gonna move
into tree pose.

1327
01:03:55,912 --> 01:03:56,970
All right, so back your mat.

1328
01:03:58,648 --> 01:03:59,945
- You're just like
the only person

1329
01:03:59,983 --> 01:04:01,382
I want to tell, like,
funny stuff to,

1330
01:04:01,417 --> 01:04:04,784
like when I see funny stuff
and stuff,

1331
01:04:04,821 --> 01:04:07,756
even if it's on a Wednesday.

1332
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:09,018
- I just think we should talk.

1333
01:04:09,058 --> 01:04:10,616
I don't know if we should
be doing this yet.

1334
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:13,288
- No, D, I don't
want to talk it to death.

1335
01:04:13,329 --> 01:04:15,422
Okay, and I don't want
to involve our parents.

1336
01:04:15,465 --> 01:04:19,799
I just want to be there
for each other.

1337
01:04:19,836 --> 01:04:20,825
Don't you?

1338
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:21,837
- Of course.

1339
01:04:21,871 --> 01:04:23,031
- So then see?

1340
01:04:23,072 --> 01:04:24,767
There's no reason for us
not to be together.

1341
01:04:24,807 --> 01:04:27,071
Except Turner Smith
wants to get into your pants.

1342
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:32,707
- No, I think he's gay.

1343
01:04:32,749 --> 01:04:35,149
What?

1344
01:04:35,185 --> 01:04:37,449
- Are you sure
you want to do this?

1345
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:39,352
- Don't you?

1346
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:43,052
- I just don't know if I
want to lose my days off yet.

1347
01:04:43,092 --> 01:04:44,821
- Well, that's okay, honey.

1348
01:04:44,861 --> 01:04:46,089
We can just take it slow,

1349
01:04:46,129 --> 01:04:49,587
and we can wean ourselves
back on to each other.

1350
01:04:49,632 --> 01:04:51,463
Right?

1351
01:04:51,501 --> 01:04:52,866
See?

1352
01:04:52,902 --> 01:04:55,871
There's no reason
we shouldn't be together.

1353
01:04:55,905 --> 01:04:57,600
Right?

1354
01:05:01,544 --> 01:05:03,944
- Triple!

1355
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:05,470
So what did she say?

1356
01:05:05,515 --> 01:05:07,073
- Huh?
- Zoe?

1357
01:05:07,116 --> 01:05:09,550
When you told her
that you were taking the job?

1358
01:05:09,586 --> 01:05:11,383
- Oh, she's cool with it.

1359
01:05:11,421 --> 01:05:12,581
- Really?
- Yeah.

1360
01:05:12,622 --> 01:05:13,680
- 60 points.

1361
01:05:13,723 --> 01:05:14,712
Just use the whole board.

1362
01:05:14,757 --> 01:05:16,588
- I will.

1363
01:05:16,626 --> 01:05:17,888
- So now when I ask you
a question,

1364
01:05:17,927 --> 01:05:19,519
you're gonna lie to my face?

1365
01:05:19,562 --> 01:05:20,927
- Maybe we can play
something else.

1366
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:21,931
- I'm not lying.

1367
01:05:21,965 --> 01:05:23,262
- Go Fish
I could probably handle.

1368
01:05:23,299 --> 01:05:25,096
- Do you think
that we can't read you?

1369
01:05:25,134 --> 01:05:28,126
- Okay, fine,
I'm not taking the job.

1370
01:05:28,171 --> 01:05:29,138
- Jeez.

1371
01:05:29,172 --> 01:05:30,139
- It's my life.

1372
01:05:30,173 --> 01:05:31,800
It's my decision.

1373
01:05:31,841 --> 01:05:33,331
I can do whatever I want.

1374
01:05:33,376 --> 01:05:35,640
- I think she just wants to know
that you've thought about it.

1375
01:05:35,678 --> 01:05:36,645
- It's in Vancouver.

1376
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:38,169
- You know, it's an opportunity.

1377
01:05:38,214 --> 01:05:39,841
I don't see that many
opportunities

1378
01:05:39,882 --> 01:05:41,349
just flying towards you.

1379
01:05:41,384 --> 01:05:43,181
I mean, you're 23
and babysitting.

1380
01:05:43,219 --> 01:05:45,949
- Oh, come on,
end of discussion.

1381
01:05:45,989 --> 01:05:47,115
- It's all about her,

1382
01:05:47,156 --> 01:05:48,555
and they're not even
really dating.

1383
01:05:48,591 --> 01:05:52,584
- That's because
you don't understand.

1384
01:05:52,629 --> 01:05:54,256
- That's because
I don't understand?

1385
01:05:54,297 --> 01:05:56,891
That's the reason
you're not dating?

1386
01:05:56,933 --> 01:05:59,026
- Okay, I'm not involving you
in this part of my life,

1387
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:02,834
so if you can
just stay out of it.

1388
01:06:06,042 --> 01:06:08,510
- I want to hit him in the head
with a shovel.

1389
01:06:12,115 --> 01:06:15,414
He's got to get out
of this house.

1390
01:06:16,853 --> 01:06:17,820
What did I say?

1391
01:06:17,854 --> 01:06:21,153
He won't even talk about it.

1392
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:22,657
Are we stuck with him forever?

1393
01:06:22,692 --> 01:06:24,057
- Just leave it alone.

1394
01:06:24,093 --> 01:06:25,560
- Forever, though!

1395
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:04,548
- Hey, are we inviting
Zoe and Helaine to the Seder?

1396
01:08:04,594 --> 01:08:05,720
I need a head count.

1397
01:08:05,762 --> 01:08:07,787
- I don't know.

1398
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,889
- Well, we've invited them
the last two years.

1399
01:08:09,932 --> 01:08:11,991
I think it might be rude
if we didn't.

1400
01:08:12,034 --> 01:08:13,695
- Okay, that's fine.

1401
01:08:13,736 --> 01:08:15,328
We can invite them.

1402
01:08:15,371 --> 01:08:18,363
- Should we also invite
Zoe's new boyfriend?

1403
01:08:18,408 --> 01:08:19,875
- What?

1404
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:21,672
- Boy, you should have seen
the hug he gave her,

1405
01:08:21,711 --> 01:08:22,678
very affectionate.

1406
01:08:22,712 --> 01:08:24,111
- Who's he?

1407
01:08:24,147 --> 01:08:26,547
- That guy in the play with her.

1408
01:08:26,582 --> 01:08:27,742
They were outside the theatre.

1409
01:08:27,784 --> 01:08:29,251
I saw them.

1410
01:08:29,285 --> 01:08:30,582
I tried to get a picture
for you,

1411
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,520
but I don't know how that camera
works on the phone.

1412
01:08:32,555 --> 01:08:33,522
You need to show me.

1413
01:08:33,556 --> 01:08:35,217
- Mom what were you thinking?

1414
01:08:35,258 --> 01:08:36,816
- I don't know.

1415
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:38,486
You're staying here for her.

1416
01:08:38,528 --> 01:08:41,463
What are you thinking?

1417
01:09:04,353 --> 01:09:05,342
- Happy Pesach!

1418
01:09:05,388 --> 01:09:09,347
- Oh, Daryl, honey.

1419
01:09:09,392 --> 01:09:11,087
My, God, aren't you eating?

1420
01:09:11,127 --> 01:09:13,152
- I've been fasting
since Yom Kippur.

1421
01:09:13,196 --> 01:09:15,664
Come in, come in.

1422
01:09:15,698 --> 01:09:18,292
- When I was 18...
- Yeah.

1423
01:09:18,334 --> 01:09:19,995
- There were no jobs.

1424
01:09:20,036 --> 01:09:21,799
This was-Herbert Hoover
was the president.

1425
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:23,362
- Yeah.
- It was the Depression.

1426
01:09:23,406 --> 01:09:25,431
- Hi, do you need any help?

1427
01:09:25,475 --> 01:09:28,308
- No, I need you to go
put on a collared shirt.

1428
01:09:28,344 --> 01:09:29,402
That one is ripped,

1429
01:09:29,445 --> 01:09:31,709
and it has holes
and schmutz all over it.

1430
01:09:31,747 --> 01:09:32,873
- What?
All right, fine.

1431
01:09:32,915 --> 01:09:34,815
I'll go put on my jacket
and button down.

1432
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:37,115
- Thank you, trailer trash baby.

1433
01:09:37,153 --> 01:09:39,178
Man, when was the last time
you actually showered?

1434
01:09:39,222 --> 01:09:41,053
- Mom, go bother Dad.
- I can't.

1435
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:42,057
We're not speaking.

1436
01:09:42,091 --> 01:09:43,353
We're having a day off.

1437
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:45,189
- I was going through
Orown Heights,

1438
01:09:45,228 --> 01:09:46,195
and it was Purim.

1439
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:47,423
So all those Hasidim,

1440
01:09:47,463 --> 01:09:49,488
you know, they give you
these bags of nuts

1441
01:09:49,532 --> 01:09:51,193
and other things like that.

1442
01:09:51,234 --> 01:09:52,929
We kept them in the car.
We ate some.

1443
01:09:52,969 --> 01:09:53,936
We actually ate some,

1444
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:55,267
but I kept most of them
in the car.

1445
01:09:55,304 --> 01:09:56,896
- Thank you.

1446
01:09:56,939 --> 01:09:57,906
It was really good.

1447
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:02,203
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

1448
01:10:02,245 --> 01:10:05,078
- Hey, oh, my God,
get me a towel.

1449
01:10:05,114 --> 01:10:06,706
Oh, it's like a shvitz in here.

1450
01:10:06,749 --> 01:10:09,343
Pretty soon we'll all be naked
talking about the old country.

1451
01:10:09,385 --> 01:10:10,352
Who's here?

1452
01:10:10,386 --> 01:10:13,685
Hey, baby, hi, hi.

1453
01:10:13,723 --> 01:10:15,418
- You're rocking
the one earring, huh?

1454
01:10:16,526 --> 01:10:18,221
- Oh, shit, I lost one.

1455
01:10:18,261 --> 01:10:20,491
Oh, these are my favorites.

1456
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:22,088
- Left is right.
Right is wrong.

1457
01:10:23,566 --> 01:10:24,533
- Hello.

1458
01:10:24,567 --> 01:10:26,034
- Hey, honey.

1459
01:10:26,068 --> 01:10:27,035
- You look beautiful.

1460
01:10:27,069 --> 01:10:28,036
- Oh, thank you so much.

1461
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:29,594
You're so adorable.

1462
01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:30,936
Can you go to your mom's

1463
01:10:30,973 --> 01:10:32,770
and see if she's got
an extra pair of earrings?

1464
01:10:32,808 --> 01:10:34,139
Brian says I look gay.

1465
01:10:34,176 --> 01:10:36,110
- It's Ellen, not Rosie.

1466
01:10:36,145 --> 01:10:37,373
- That's better.

1467
01:10:37,413 --> 01:10:38,380
- Yeah, of course.

1468
01:10:38,414 --> 01:10:39,711
I think Zoe left a pair
in my room.

1469
01:10:39,749 --> 01:10:40,716
I'll go get them.

1470
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:41,717
Just give me one sec.

1471
01:10:41,751 --> 01:10:42,911
- Angel.

1472
01:10:42,952 --> 01:10:44,783
I mean,
I don't mind looking gay.

1473
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,448
- What you did was,
you planted trees,

1474
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:52,052
you cleaned up the place,
you painted the benches green.

1475
01:10:52,094 --> 01:10:53,220
- Yeah.

1476
01:10:53,262 --> 01:10:55,389
- You know, things that you did
in a park...

1477
01:10:55,431 --> 01:10:56,728
- Right.
- For six months.

1478
01:10:59,268 --> 01:11:00,235
- I brought these.

1479
01:11:00,269 --> 01:11:01,258
- These are nice.

1480
01:11:01,304 --> 01:11:02,271
- Zoe left them in my room.

1481
01:11:02,305 --> 01:11:05,274
- Gee, can I keep them?
- Yeah.

1482
01:11:05,308 --> 01:11:06,536
- All right.
I knew I liked him.

1483
01:11:06,576 --> 01:11:07,543
- Hi.
- Hi.

1484
01:11:07,577 --> 01:11:08,874
- Oh, everything looks
beautiful.

1485
01:11:08,911 --> 01:11:10,003
- You look beautiful.

1486
01:11:10,046 --> 01:11:11,809
- Thank you.
I brought you some stuff.

1487
01:11:11,847 --> 01:11:13,075
I didn't know what you needed.

1488
01:11:13,115 --> 01:11:15,106
- Wow, those are thick.

1489
01:11:15,151 --> 01:11:16,140
Are they ortho?

1490
01:11:16,185 --> 01:11:17,447
- Orthofeminist.

1491
01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:18,578
- How about that?

1492
01:11:18,621 --> 01:11:20,213
- Yeah, they're just newly out.

1493
01:11:20,256 --> 01:11:21,416
- Great.
- Like myself.

1494
01:11:21,457 --> 01:11:22,583
I'm going gay, you know.

1495
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:24,024
- Are you really?
- I'm kidding you.

1496
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:25,152
Anyway, look what I brought,

1497
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:26,320
a little after-dinner treat.

1498
01:11:26,362 --> 01:11:28,853
- Helaine, is this real?

1499
01:11:28,898 --> 01:11:30,126
- Of course.

1500
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:31,724
I can't get through a Seder
without one.

1501
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:32,734
- Well, you know what?

1502
01:11:32,768 --> 01:11:33,928
I'm just gonna put it over here.

1503
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:35,961
- We're gonna party!

1504
01:11:36,005 --> 01:11:37,336
Remember where that is now.

1505
01:11:37,373 --> 01:11:39,603
- I won't forget.

1506
01:11:39,642 --> 01:11:42,338
- Okay, can anybody have this?

1507
01:11:42,378 --> 01:11:44,107
- Yeah, sure, it's all yours.

1508
01:11:44,146 --> 01:11:45,545
You know, actually,
we're gonna use

1509
01:11:45,581 --> 01:11:47,515
the kiddie Haggadahs this year,

1510
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:49,313
'cause we just sort of want
to whip through it.

1511
01:11:49,352 --> 01:11:51,320
Not that I don't love
a really good long Seder.

1512
01:11:51,354 --> 01:11:52,753
But why don't you take those?

1513
01:11:52,788 --> 01:11:55,621
Put them on the table
in case someone gets sexist.

1514
01:11:55,658 --> 01:11:56,716
- I only have two of them.

1515
01:11:56,759 --> 01:11:57,726
- That's fine.

1516
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,988
I think that's all we'll need.

1517
01:11:59,028 --> 01:12:00,222
- Cheers, cheers.

1518
01:12:00,262 --> 01:12:01,729
- All right, cheers to you.

1519
01:12:01,764 --> 01:12:02,856
So glad you're here.

1520
01:12:07,236 --> 01:12:09,204
- Oh, my God,
this is a nightmare.

1521
01:12:09,238 --> 01:12:14,073
- Okay, everyone, people,
people, people.

1522
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:16,169
Thank you all for coming.

1523
01:12:16,212 --> 01:12:18,009
Please take your seats.

1524
01:12:18,047 --> 01:12:20,982
Let's begin our Seder.

1525
01:12:22,385 --> 01:12:23,750
- These things are gorgeous.

1526
01:12:23,786 --> 01:12:25,378
Zoe, where did you get these?

1527
01:12:25,421 --> 01:12:28,447
- Everybody get ready to dip
your finger in the wine.

1528
01:12:56,419 --> 01:12:59,388
- Bravo, whoo!

1529
01:12:59,422 --> 01:13:01,117
- Oh, boy.

1530
01:13:01,157 --> 01:13:03,421
Yeah.

1531
01:13:10,232 --> 01:13:13,030
- So, Zoe, how is the play?

1532
01:13:13,069 --> 01:13:15,003
- Oh, sick of it.

1533
01:13:15,037 --> 01:13:16,265
- Really superb.

1534
01:13:16,305 --> 01:13:18,068
- And that other boy,
what was his name?

1535
01:13:18,107 --> 01:13:19,574
- Turner.
- Turner.

1536
01:13:19,608 --> 01:13:21,473
He was adorable.

1537
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:23,501
I want to date him.

1538
01:13:23,546 --> 01:13:25,070
- He was very good.

1539
01:13:25,114 --> 01:13:27,947
- You two
are so natural together.

1540
01:13:27,983 --> 01:13:30,281
- Yeah, he's great to work with.

1541
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:32,378
- Sometimes when the acting
is that good,

1542
01:13:32,421 --> 01:13:34,321
it doesn't really seem
like acting.

1543
01:13:34,356 --> 01:13:36,153
- Mom.

1544
01:13:36,192 --> 01:13:38,251
- Come on, what is going on
with you two?

1545
01:13:38,294 --> 01:13:40,194
- Joanie, I don't think
that's very appropriate.

1546
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:41,856
- Oh, please, we're all family.

1547
01:13:41,897 --> 01:13:44,127
- I think they should
sort things out by themselves.

1548
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:46,600
- Your father and I
don't take days off.

1549
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:48,296
- Yeah,
maybe that's the problem.

1550
01:13:48,337 --> 01:13:49,463
- That's enough.

1551
01:13:49,505 --> 01:13:51,268
- I think what they're doing
is mature.

1552
01:13:51,307 --> 01:13:52,774
Hear, hear.
- Amen.

1553
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:55,140
- Well, I don't think it makes
sense to be seeing other people.

1554
01:13:55,177 --> 01:13:56,508
- Well, that's because
you've only been

1555
01:13:56,545 --> 01:13:58,069
with one person your whole life.

1556
01:13:58,114 --> 01:14:00,514
- You know absolutely nothing
about what you're talking about.

1557
01:14:00,549 --> 01:14:01,880
You're so young.

1558
01:14:01,917 --> 01:14:04,249
You're either in a relationship,
or you're not.

1559
01:14:04,286 --> 01:14:05,651
- And you make each other
miserable.

1560
01:14:05,688 --> 01:14:08,384
- Oh, and you haven't been
Mr. Happy Pants lately.

1561
01:14:08,424 --> 01:14:10,415
I would say you're more anxious,

1562
01:14:10,459 --> 01:14:12,620
and you're moody,
and you're cruel.

1563
01:14:12,661 --> 01:14:13,958
- Joanie.

1564
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:15,395
- All right, I know.
It's none of my business.

1565
01:14:15,431 --> 01:14:18,662
But there's a fair way
to do this and there's not.

1566
01:14:18,701 --> 01:14:20,828
I want Daryl
to get to go to Vancouver.

1567
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:21,837
- Why?

1568
01:14:21,871 --> 01:14:23,338
- I mean, sure, the pay is shit,

1569
01:14:23,372 --> 01:14:26,034
but he gets to work
on Max Kleaman's book.

1570
01:14:26,075 --> 01:14:28,543
And yes, I don't know
who the fuck that is.

1571
01:14:28,577 --> 01:14:31,239
But apparently Daryl adores him.

1572
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,508
- Of course.

1573
01:14:32,548 --> 01:14:33,640
- So why won't you let him go?

1574
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:34,671
- I won't let him?

1575
01:14:34,717 --> 01:14:36,275
- That's not fair.
- Joanie-

1576
01:14:36,318 --> 01:14:37,979
- What is she talking about?
- Here's a deal.

1577
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,510
You take days off.

1578
01:14:39,555 --> 01:14:40,522
Why not take a year off?

1579
01:14:40,556 --> 01:14:41,853
He'll be back in the spring.

1580
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:43,756
You can sort out
your little relationship then.

1581
01:14:43,793 --> 01:14:45,522
- It's not
a little relationship.

1582
01:14:45,561 --> 01:14:47,961
- A real relationship takes more
than four days a week.

1583
01:14:47,997 --> 01:14:49,430
- That's enough!

1584
01:15:04,847 --> 01:15:06,838
- Zoe.

1585
01:15:17,693 --> 01:15:19,661
Zoe, please stay.

1586
01:15:19,695 --> 01:15:24,928
- Were you not planning
on telling me about Vancouver?

1587
01:15:24,967 --> 01:15:26,628
Did you not think
I'd be excited for you?

1588
01:15:26,669 --> 01:15:27,966
- Of course, I wanted to-

1589
01:15:28,003 --> 01:15:29,732
- Well, we're supposed
to be communicating.

1590
01:15:29,772 --> 01:15:30,830
- And we are.

1591
01:15:30,873 --> 01:15:32,306
Look at how well
we're using our time,

1592
01:15:32,341 --> 01:15:33,330
how well we've adjusted.

1593
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:34,706
I think we're doing pretty well.

1594
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:37,541
- Those aren't my earrings,
Daryl.

1595
01:15:41,283 --> 01:15:45,982
Whose are they?

1596
01:15:46,021 --> 01:15:51,721
- Um, I don't know.

1597
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,524
Maybe they're my mom's.

1598
01:15:54,563 --> 01:15:57,396
- Have you brought girls here?

1599
01:15:59,602 --> 01:16:00,796
What do you want me to say?

1600
01:16:00,836 --> 01:16:04,602
- Well, if you did,
I'd like you to say yes.

1601
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,164
- We were allowed to.

1602
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:08,267
- Like, your parents met them?

1603
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:09,334
- It's their house.

1604
01:16:09,378 --> 01:16:10,777
- You introduced them?

1605
01:16:10,813 --> 01:16:12,781
You were, like,
dating these girls?

1606
01:16:12,815 --> 01:16:14,180
You had some sort
of sustainable-

1607
01:16:14,216 --> 01:16:15,706
- I don't think we should
be doing this.

1608
01:16:15,751 --> 01:16:16,718
- No, I'm sorry, Daryl.

1609
01:16:16,752 --> 01:16:20,688
You brought them home.

1610
01:16:20,723 --> 01:16:25,592
Did you tell them
they were beautiful or special?

1611
01:16:29,031 --> 01:16:35,527
These girls probably thought
you cared.

1612
01:16:35,571 --> 01:16:37,630
Or did you?

1613
01:16:41,977 --> 01:16:44,502
I slept with Turner.

1614
01:16:48,217 --> 01:16:52,017
- That is so fucking immature.

1615
01:16:52,054 --> 01:16:53,612
You're saying that
because you're hurt,

1616
01:16:53,656 --> 01:16:55,351
and you want to hurt me back.

1617
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:03,093
Well, what the fuck did you do?

1618
01:17:10,272 --> 01:17:12,797
- I didn't like it.

1619
01:17:17,246 --> 01:17:20,409
- Well, that's too bad.

1620
01:17:20,449 --> 01:17:22,212
'Cause I did.

1621
01:17:30,893 --> 01:17:34,488
- Then what are you
still doing here?

1622
01:17:37,633 --> 01:17:41,501
I guess this has been
kind of the goal, right?

1623
01:17:41,537 --> 01:17:46,975
So this is where
we were headed anyway.

1624
01:17:47,009 --> 01:17:51,446
- I'm not gonna do it.

1625
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:54,040
- It's okay.

1626
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:56,210
I'll do it for you.

1627
01:18:09,765 --> 01:18:11,995
It's over, okay?

1628
01:18:12,034 --> 01:18:14,195
Is everybody clear?

1629
01:18:14,236 --> 01:18:16,431
Are we all fucking clear
on that?

1630
01:18:27,149 --> 01:18:29,413
- Next year in Jerusalem.

1631
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:57,974
Sorry about that.

1632
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:03,918
I just don't know
what's going on with you,

1633
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:07,479
and it's made me kind of crazy.

1634
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:03,072
- So have you heard from D?

1635
01:20:03,112 --> 01:20:05,205
- No.

1636
01:20:05,247 --> 01:20:07,238
Why don't you call him?

1637
01:20:07,282 --> 01:20:10,308
I hear the girls
are doing it nowadays.

1638
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:13,287
- No.

1639
01:20:13,322 --> 01:20:16,348
I don't think I can do this,
Mom.

1640
01:20:16,391 --> 01:20:18,586
- Yes, you can.

1641
01:20:18,627 --> 01:20:20,652
You'll get used to it.

1642
01:20:20,696 --> 01:20:23,688
Then you'll start over.

1643
01:20:30,305 --> 01:20:34,002
I'm here for you, Zo,

1644
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:36,567
even when I'm not.

1645
01:20:51,326 --> 01:20:53,794
- I think that's everything.

1646
01:20:53,829 --> 01:20:54,796
- Okay.

1647
01:20:54,830 --> 01:21:00,598
- I put your night guard
in there.

1648
01:21:00,636 --> 01:21:01,603
- I need that.

1649
01:21:01,637 --> 01:21:04,037
- Yes, no grinding.

1650
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:05,198
- Mom would be mad.

1651
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,800
- Mm-hmm.

1652
01:21:07,843 --> 01:21:09,470
- Oh.

1653
01:21:09,511 --> 01:21:12,708
I want to give you this back.

1654
01:21:16,351 --> 01:21:19,377
- It's for my new boyfriend.

1655
01:21:19,421 --> 01:21:20,388
- I made copies.

1656
01:21:28,797 --> 01:21:32,893
- Hey, remember the time
that we broke up?

1657
01:21:32,935 --> 01:21:34,960
- Heyo!

1658
01:21:35,003 --> 01:21:36,834
Good one.

1659
01:21:36,872 --> 01:21:40,171
- Yeah.

1660
01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:41,471
Anyway.

1661
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:45,207
- Here, come here.

1662
01:21:58,527 --> 01:22:01,325
- It's hard packing
for yourself.

1663
01:22:01,363 --> 01:22:04,662
Makes you appreciate Mom.

1664
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,998
- I don't have her superior
spatial relations.

1665
01:22:07,035 --> 01:22:08,229
- No.

1666
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:10,830
- Brian got that.

1667
01:22:13,408 --> 01:22:15,467
You know she's sorry.

1668
01:22:17,212 --> 01:22:20,807
She's told me to do plenty
of things over the years.

1669
01:22:20,849 --> 01:22:22,214
- I know.
- And you know what?

1670
01:22:22,251 --> 01:22:25,345
99 out of a 100,
she was right.

1671
01:22:25,387 --> 01:22:27,014
- Yeah, just ask her.

1672
01:22:27,055 --> 01:22:30,115
- Come on, best decisions
I've made were hers.

1673
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:31,625
- Yeah, but Dad,
you're not happy.

1674
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:33,628
- Happy enough.

1675
01:23:16,471 --> 01:23:18,336
- Oh, it's a pretty day for it.

1676
01:23:18,373 --> 01:23:19,965
Honey, I want you to call us

1677
01:23:20,008 --> 01:23:22,238
the minute
that your plane lands.

1678
01:23:22,277 --> 01:23:23,244
Thank you.

1679
01:23:23,278 --> 01:23:24,939
- Okay.

1680
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:25,947
- I love you.

1681
01:23:25,981 --> 01:23:27,448
- I love you, Mom.

1682
01:23:27,482 --> 01:23:31,145
- We're proud of you.

1683
01:23:31,186 --> 01:23:33,051
- Wait a minute.

1684
01:23:33,088 --> 01:23:34,419
- What?

1685
01:23:34,456 --> 01:23:35,423
Come on.

1686
01:23:35,457 --> 01:23:36,424
Put that away.

1687
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:38,221
- It's important.
Come on.

1688
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:43,630
- Thank you.

1689
01:23:43,665 --> 01:23:45,394
- Oh, you're never gonna get
a cab here.

1690
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:46,401
- Just wait a minute.

1691
01:23:46,435 --> 01:23:47,402
He'll be all right.

1692
01:23:47,436 --> 01:23:48,562
- You think?

1693
01:23:48,603 --> 01:23:50,400
Why don't we walk down
to the avenue?

1694
01:23:50,439 --> 01:23:53,499
- Okay.

1695
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:42,245
- # I picked a color long ago #

1696
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:46,249
# To suit my tawdry tales
of woe #

1697
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:50,390
# And now it doesn't fit #

1698
01:24:50,432 --> 01:24:54,664
# Well, my friend
who's a fan of shades #

1699
01:24:54,703 --> 01:24:58,469
# Traveled to the Everglades #

1700
01:24:58,507 --> 01:25:02,568
# And asked if I'd come with #

1701
01:25:02,611 --> 01:25:06,741
# There's no one
I would rather see #

1702
01:25:06,782 --> 01:25:09,182
# She's a special friend to me #

1703
01:25:09,217 --> 01:25:15,019
# But I feel
I'd be leaving you behind #

1704
01:25:15,056 --> 01:25:18,890
# That's the game
of love and war #

1705
01:25:18,927 --> 01:25:21,725
# Choose a side
you're fighting for #

1706
01:25:21,763 --> 01:25:26,700
# And see if there's
a white flag to be raised #

1707
01:25:26,735 --> 01:25:28,532
# I know it's not
a fair assessment #

1708
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:31,004
# But I can't be asked
to wrestle with the colors #

1709
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:36,773
# Of who you've now become #

1710
01:25:36,812 --> 01:25:38,609
# 'Cause you and I,
we're not the same #

1711
01:25:38,647 --> 01:25:40,706
# And neither can be
held to blame #

1712
01:25:40,749 --> 01:25:47,450
# It's just the way
the story has to end #

1713
01:25:47,489 --> 01:25:51,425
# Being here and being there #

1714
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:55,726
# There's no space
for being where #

1715
01:25:55,764 --> 01:25:59,700
# I feel I should be #

1716
01:25:59,734 --> 01:26:03,568
# Loneliness is like a drink #

1717
01:26:03,605 --> 01:26:07,041
# You think you're on the verge
of sinking #

1718
01:26:07,075 --> 01:26:11,273
# When you tame the sea #

1719
01:26:11,313 --> 01:26:13,508
# Interims are good
for suckers #

1720
01:26:13,548 --> 01:26:15,345
# Feeling like they're down
on luck #

1721
01:26:15,383 --> 01:26:21,413
# And I'm not gonna drown
in my own tears #

1722
01:26:21,456 --> 01:26:23,447
# I can't ask you anymore #

1723
01:26:23,492 --> 01:26:25,517
# To be the one that I adore #

1724
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:30,793
# Only when the time
is right for me #

1725
01:26:30,832 --> 01:26:33,995
# So let's just be #

1726
01:27:44,306 --> 01:27:50,404
- # Baby, baby, baby, please #

1727
01:27:50,445 --> 01:27:56,247
# Baby, baby, I'm on my knees #

1728
01:27:56,284 --> 01:27:58,013
# You're hot as hell #

1729
01:27:58,053 --> 01:28:02,217
# I'm gonna freeze #

1730
01:28:02,257 --> 01:28:08,355
# Baby, baby, baby, please #

1731
01:28:08,396 --> 01:28:14,301
# Baby, baby, baby, stay #

1732
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:19,831
# Baby, baby, I'm afraid #

1733
01:28:19,874 --> 01:28:26,040
# The pillow's cold
where your head used to lay #

1734
01:28:26,081 --> 01:28:31,917
# Baby, baby, stay #

1735
01:28:31,953 --> 01:28:34,615
Oh, girl.

1736
01:28:34,656 --> 01:28:37,648
You know I miss you so much.

1737
01:28:37,692 --> 01:28:43,631
I think about you at nighttime
and the morning time too.

1738
01:28:43,665 --> 01:28:45,826
I don't know
where you've gone to,

1739
01:28:45,867 --> 01:28:49,234
and I don't know
if you're coming back.

1740
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:52,205
I wish I would just
hear from you.

1741
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:54,572
Until then, I just gotta...

1742
01:28:54,609 --> 01:28:55,701
I gotta sing.
I gotta sing.

1743
01:28:55,744 --> 01:29:01,649
# Baby, baby, baby girl #

1744
01:29:01,683 --> 01:29:07,644
# Baby, baby,
you rock my world #
