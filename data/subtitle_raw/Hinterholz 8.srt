1
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,349
You mind?

2
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,106
Thanks.

3
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,748
Oh, strong ones, huh?

4
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,225
I bet you think I'm a lunatic.

5
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,139
I'm not.

6
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,349
It's only -

7
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,666
- we all have our dreams.

8
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,265
Right.

9
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,826
But then things take off, and ...

10
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,265
Kirk to Entenprise.

11
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,949
Just beam me up.

12
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,301
There's no intelligent life
on this planet.

13
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,939
Come here.

14
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,820
Say ...

15
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,226
Can't you play normal,
like other kids?

16
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,142
Never mind.
I'll reprogram it in no time.

17
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,549
We're leaving anyway.

18
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,860
Some more?

19
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,867
No, thanks.
That's very kind of you, but -

20
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,185
- actually, I have to ...

21
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,540
Right! We also have to ...

22
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,145
Please.

23
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,743
Great place, isn't it?

24
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,303
You bet, Mrs. Krkal.

25
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,386
Krcal.

26
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,140
After you.

27
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,029
Look, Mrs. Krcal, personally ...

28
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,100
I feel a house is the center of life -

29
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,460
- the source of our satisfaction.

30
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,343
You can read it all in here.

31
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,380
Thanks.

32
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,145
We'll talk it over.

33
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,419
Sure.

34
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,302
Well then ...

35
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,149
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

36
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,546
Come on.

37
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,342
Can't you say good bye?

38
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,223
Die, Klingon!

39
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,625
You too!

40
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,945
Hey, you!

41
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,140
Aren't you the guy
selling homes for life?

42
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,224
How long's that exactly?

43
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,225
Forever.

44
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,740
If you take care.

45
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,308
What'll it cost me?

46
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,820
1-6-2-2-6-5-0.

47
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,870
How many weeks allowance is that?

48
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,066
Depends on the allowance.

49
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,150
How much does Dad get?

50
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,706
Not enough.

51
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,909
Unfortunately.

52
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,182
Guess we saw it again, huh?

53
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,346
Can't you please stop that?

54
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,346
What?

55
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,188
That grunting.

56
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,384
Hey, Meier!

57
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,579
Yeah?

58
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,709
- my cellar steps this weekend.

59
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,063
You got time?
- No .

60
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,067
My kid's getting christened.

61
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,548
And afterwards?

62
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,229
Don't remind me.

63
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,621
My old lady's wacky.

64
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,941
Invited all the relatives.

65
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,459
You got to keep me company.

66
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,226
Krcal here.

67
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,506
Hello.

68
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,860
Not good. I'm not in my office yet.

69
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,668
Sure. Two minutes.

70
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,383
Thanks. Bye.

71
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:57,742
Good afternoon.

72
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,820
Afternoon.

73
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,267
Did you finally buy the house?

74
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,581
Not yet.

75
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,508
You waiting for a sale?

76
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,585
May I?

77
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,945
Mr. Meier,
did the boss tell you that the caviar -

78
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,739
- has to be in parliament by 3?

79
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,344
We know.

80
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,669
No shit.

81
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,544
Just look at that cardboard shack.

82
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,866
I bet it costs -

83
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,708
- 3 million.

84
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,666
What? No.

85
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,946
It's only 1,6.

86
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,907
And where you gonna put it?

87
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,668
Lot, cellar -

88
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,948
- 3 million easy.

89
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,541
3? 3 and a half, minimum.

90
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,304
You know what?

91
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,304
If you're smart,
look for an old house and fix it up.

92
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,661
You should see my ranch.

93
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,509
I started 5 years ago,
and its almost done.

94
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,382
Cost me 1.3.

95
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,659
Good for you.

96
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,064
Hello, Mrs. Knackal.

97
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,704
But my prefab is built in a day.

98
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,389
And how long's it gonna hold up?

99
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,708
Bounced each brick myself
at least 5 times.

100
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,105
More often than your old lady, I bet.

101
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,304
You don't like jokes?

102
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,545
Sure.

103
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,422
If they have class.

104
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,261
Don't forget the caviar.

105
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,263
Sure thing.

106
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,388
Where'd you say your house was?

107
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,379
Just a second.

108
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,338
Krcal here.

109
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,029
I'm not in my office yet.

110
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,823
Kirk to Entenprise.
Entenprise come in.

111
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,225
Please beam me up the hill.

112
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,748
Lousy weather this summer.

113
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,781
Philipp, give me the phone, please.

114
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,786
O.K.

115
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,301
Look, Margit. Here it is.

116
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,306
There.

117
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,864
Meier's house.

118
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,545
The red one with the little roof -

119
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,468
- is Sepp Forstinger's.

120
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,828
Great place, isn't it?

121
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,822
I don't know.

122
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,259
Maybe we should look -

123
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,099
- for a little house to fix up?

124
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,698
Daddy, I have to pee.

125
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,423
Go ahead.

126
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,904
You're old enough.

127
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,180
I'm worried, Herbert.

128
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,466
I don't want to end up
like those people.

129
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,743
They start building a house at 28,
and at 45 they're still at it -

130
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,303
- and on each others nerves.

131
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,785
Sure, sweety. We don't want that.

132
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,503
But we'll need -

133
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,306
- 1 and a half million for
a cardboard house -

134
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,225
- and altogether it comes
to 3, 4, 5 million.

135
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,341
Mom! Dad! Come, hurry!

136
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,868
Can't he pee normal
like everybode else?

137
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,664
What's the matter?

138
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,108
Look! It's a dream.

139
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,029
How sweet.

140
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,742
This must be fate.

141
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,099
You're corny, Dad.

142
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,939
Come on.

143
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,019
Daddy -

144
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,504
- is that a haunted house?

145
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,984
No -

146
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,340
- this is a house for life.

147
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,183
What do you think?

148
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,589
No shit.

149
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,783
Was on sale.

150
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,543
Not expensive.
- Super! Could use one, too.

151
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,788
You don't even have a garden yet.

152
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,388
prophyclactic?

153
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,265
Shit!

154
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,499
Hello!

155
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,587
I hope this isn't inconvenient.
We just happened -

156
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,264
- to pass by.

157
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,662
Great caviar, huh?

158
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,430
They weren't too hungry
in parliament, you know.

159
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,621
Me, I don't like it anyway!

160
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,622
And I don't really care.

161
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,945
This is my wife, Margit.
Come here.

162
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,867
Hi, gorgeous!

163
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:23,787
Hello.

164
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,178
This is Mr. Meier.
We work together.

165
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,948
Mr. Forstinger,
we work together, too.

166
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,788
Can't you say hello?

167
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,020
Hi.

168
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,467
Can I offer something?

169
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,980
Maybe some caviar?

170
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,820
Something wrong?

171
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,583
Should there be?

172
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,349
Hi. I'm Silvia Meier.

173
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,744
Krcal. Hello.

174
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,305
Right. My worse half.

175
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,548
Pretty funny.

176
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,579
Are you wacky?

177
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,503
The ittle monkey's been yelling since
he got water over his head.

178
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,109
You mind looking after your kid?

179
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,540
It's yours, too. Sadly enough.

180
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,866
There's someone nude in the garden!
- Don't touch him!

181
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,300
What a nice vegetable patch.
- Yeah.

182
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,270
You, too?
- Not yet.

183
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,507
Hey, I don't pay for watching.

184
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,579
slow digging 30 shillings an hour.

185
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,429
So, what do you say?

186
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,749
This is what I call living.

187
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,742
It's a huge house.

188
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,102
I wanted to ask you ...
are you busy now?

189
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,062
I'd love to show you something.

190
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,779
Let's go in.

191
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,548
O.K. No, wait a minute ...

192
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,749
Safety door, huh?

193
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,140
I'm not sure that was smart ...

194
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,619
It's O.K.

195
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,862
My house was in worse shape.

196
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,138
I'd move in in 2 months, if I wanted.

197
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,506
Sure. It's not -

198
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,382
- so bad, is it?

199
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,979
Well, it won't pass the elk test.

200
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,946
Got a beer at home?

201
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,139
Mr. Forstinger -

202
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,419
- I don't live here yet.

203
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,184
Well, no shit.

204
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,380
Needs cleaning out first.

205
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,949
A job for the old lady.

206
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,544
You want to build, too?
- Not exactly. We'd rather have -

207
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,627
A prefab.
But -

208
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,899
- the money and so...

209
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,749
Forget it.

210
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,703
I barf just by the mention
of "money".

211
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,299
What?

212
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,502
I vomit.

213
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,183
What a shame.

214
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,105
A garden's great for kids.

215
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,224
Why don't you fix up -

216
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,859
- your own little house?

217
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,338
Look, Mom!

218
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,986
Philipp, are you crazy?

219
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,790
Why? The phaser was only set
on stun.

220
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,102
But basically -

221
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,348
- it could be fixed up.

222
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,665
Well ...

223
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,741
Right.

224
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,180
What should it cost, approximately?

225
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,705
400.

226
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,225
At the max.

227
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,023
Maximally max ...

228
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,064
Who owns this shack?
- Don't know.

229
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,705
Hey!

230
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,220
Riding by my house like that!

231
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,860
It's not your house yet.

232
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,788
But it's going to be.

233
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,184
Well, then ...

234
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,264
I'm Herbert.

235
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,460
Andy.

236
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,345
I'm Sepp.

237
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,585
We know.

238
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,386
O.K. Herbert.
Let's go down to the village pub.

239
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,423
They'll know who owns it.
And then we'll buy it.

240
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,380
O.K.

241
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,501
No, wait a minute.
Is that a good idea?

242
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,541
Pub's always a good idea.

243
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,423
No. I'd rather do it tomorrow.

244
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,739
Kirk to Entenpr ise.
We've landed on a hostile planet.

245
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,144
Kirk, over and out.

246
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,749
Hi, little girl.

247
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,339
Oh, hello there.

248
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,299
Could you tell me -

249
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,628
Up on the hill is a little house -

250
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,548
- with blue windows.

251
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,468
I've never been that far.

252
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,628
Then you don't know if it's for sale?

253
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,022
Wait! Who'd know?

254
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,262
The mayor would know.
Mr. Kandler.

255
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,985
He's just having lunch over there.

256
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,385
Right.

257
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,103
It's Kandlers house anyway.

258
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,501
But I never said so, O.K.?

259
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,260
Wait ...

260
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,466
Die, Klingon!

261
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,310
Mommy,
she hit me right on the nose.

262
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,782
Why can't you play normal,
like other kids?

263
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,739
I don't believe it.

264
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,865
The owner's in the pub. Let's go.

265
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,708
You go. We'll wait.

266
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,026
O.K. Give me the phone.
- No!

267
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,460
Franz finally found the deer
he wounded two weeks ago.

268
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,060
It stank like the plague.

269
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,023
Don't you joke about the plague.

270
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,140
Not here.

271
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,263
Excuse me.

272
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,943
I'm from Vienna ...

273
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,664
Go on playing.

274
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,989
Don't mind me.

275
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,823
Excuse me, I'm -

276
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,628
- lookin for the ...
- mayor.

277
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,899
Lord Mayor!

278
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:44,781
Right.

279
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,662
He's already waiting for
you in the other room.

280
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,859
Come along.

281
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,706
Thanks.

282
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,903
I've set up a preliminary contract.

283
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,745
Sure.

284
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,784
Mr. Kandler -

285
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:09,827
Good day.

286
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,827
It's "Grüß Gott".

287
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,019
Of course. Grüß Gott.

288
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,062
Mister ...
- Krcal.

289
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,309
This is Mr. Mündl.

290
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,539
Grüß Gott.

291
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,744
Pleasure.
- Me, too.

292
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,825
Say, Krcal?

293
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,385
You're not a foreigner, are you?

294
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,823
I mean, I saw right out
that you're no nigger.

295
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,547
You want to buy my house?

296
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,500
Right, well ...

297
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,543
Yes. Basically yes.

298
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,938
Then sit down.

299
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,660
It's like this.
We're sort of interested.

300
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,701
Actually we're -

301
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,945
- thrilled.

302
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,546
My wife and I found it
when we went hiking, and it's -

303
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,708
-like a dream. Really.
Great place.

304
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,703
Hard to find one like it nowadays.

305
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,026
What did you have in mind,
financially?

306
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,987
Around 300.

307
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,140
350.

308
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,904
Mr. Krcal is also interested -

309
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,867
- in the house.

310
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,705
Why "also"?

311
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,065
Mr. Mündl and I've been
negotiating for months.

312
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,659
And he just made me
a tempting offer.

313
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,585
I understand.

314
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,670
And we just wanted to settle it.
- Right.

315
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,666
Well then ...

316
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,388
I'll have to talk to my wife.

317
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,909
Do that.

318
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,182
Mündl,
do you have a pen for the contract?

319
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,260
Wait!

320
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,868
Do you have a phone?

321
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,139
We do.

322
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,025
Thanks.

323
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,508
She hit me smack in the nose.

324
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,265
I bet it wasn't on purpose.

325
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,266
It was.

326
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,623
Come on!

327
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,384
Honey, please!

328
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,023
Nobody home?

329
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:10,626
Unfortunately.

330
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,229
Tough luck.

331
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,900
400.000. Not a penny more.

332
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,098
O.K.

333
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,938
400.000.

334
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,026
Deal closed!

335
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,345
Sorry, Mr. Mündl.

336
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,780
But I can't turn down -

337
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,140
- such an offer.

338
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,578
It's allright.

339
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,104
Tough luck.

340
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,143
Could I now have my ...

341
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,022
Bye, Mr. Mündl!

342
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,182
I'm sorry, Mr. Mündl.

343
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,625
I understand how you must feel.

344
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,061
But the building loan allows
me more flexibility.

345
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,545
Thanks.

346
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,503
Got a pen for the contract?

347
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,740
Sure. Here.

348
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,100
It still hurts, Mom.

349
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,306
Dad'll come soon. I hope.

350
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,664
Grüß Gott, Mr. Krcal.

351
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,302
Please, Mr. Krcal.

352
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,429
Finally!

353
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,541
Sorry it took so long.
Couldn't help it, 'cause he -

354
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,589
- where were you when I called?

355
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,109
We should at least have -

356
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,266
- asked Willi first.
- Listen ...

357
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,422
We do have an architect
in our family.

358
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,939
Not in our family. In yours.

359
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,301
I've thought it through.

360
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,945
The building loan
covers almost 440.000.

361
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,910
And we still could ...

362
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,946
No way.

363
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,228
We're not touching
Philipp's savings book.

364
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,421
No parking space. Darn!

365
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,383
That's his starting capital.
You said -

366
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,023
- his ticket to the top.

367
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,380
Your own words. Remember?

368
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,023
I said that?

369
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,426
I never get that corny.

370
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,547
Jesus!
We're circling here like Sputnik.

371
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,102
I'll drive up to the next district.
Maybe there I'll find a space.

372
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,703
When I'm grown -

373
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,739
- I'll be captain
of the Entenprise anyway.

374
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,305
I don't care about my savings book.

375
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,462
See? He doesn't care.

376
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,306
But I do.

377
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,387
Besides,
most of it's my parents' money.

378
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,308
And I'll have to find a way
to tell them -

379
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,626
- that we bought a house in the pits.

380
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,580
Vienna, that's the pits!

381
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,587
And we live right smack in the middle.

382
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,066
Right there, where it's the smelliest.

383
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,628
Close the window.

384
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,141
Time for bed.

385
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,943
We'll make it.

386
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,024
Have to.

387
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,420
Hinterholz is my only chance.

388
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,819
Even if it means taking up
an extra loan.

389
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,178
You think we're doing the right thing?

390
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,145
What if something happens?

391
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,022
What could happen?

392
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,141
If anything happens to you -

393
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,341
- I'll be all alone with Philipp.

394
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,059
Something happens to me,
you're still alone with him.

395
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,101
What's that got to do with a loan?

396
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,463
I'm sure we'll find a way.

397
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,945
Since your building loan
isn't mature yet -

398
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,904
- I'd say we help you out
with an interim loan.

399
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,141
Let's check that out.

400
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,629
As far as I remember, you can
scrape up 9.000 a month -

401
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,786
- if you don't mind my saying that.

402
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,982
So let's round it off to 10.000.

403
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,301
It's easier for the computer
that way.

404
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,422
With a 15-year term -

405
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,026
- we'd have 840.000 to work with.

406
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,189
Of course you have fixed costs like
property tax, credit tax -

407
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,948
- notary public bills, life insurance -

408
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,903
- so that we should consider -

409
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,668
- adding 10%.

410
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,101
Which brings us
to monthly payments of -

411
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,660
- something like 11.700.

412
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,145
In any case, we should -

413
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:57,025
- ask for a rebuilding loan.
That's long-term and semi-yearly.

414
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,583
Meaning no monthly payments
in that sense.

415
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,825
Mr. Krcal, please -

416
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,623
- sign here.

417
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,105
Could I just ask something?

418
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,223
Mrs. Krcal, just consider -

419
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,739
- a loan as a way of saving.
Only that -

420
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,306
- you cash in now, not in 20 years.

421
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,069
Welcome to the club.

422
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,748
Time to swing the axe.

423
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,861
I'll lend you some tools, if you want.

424
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,465
I've got my own.

425
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,939
Super!

426
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,579
What's this?

427
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,462
0.4 grams?

428
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,381
Let the old lady have it
for the kitchen -

429
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,023
- for cracking lentils.

430
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,026
Come on.

431
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,309
I'll show you something.

432
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,419
How's that?

433
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,741
Well, I won't need all that.

434
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,981
Sure. That's just the basics.

435
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,267
O.K. Then I'll take ... but what?

436
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,304
Hold it! Can't take any of these.
I need them.

437
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,549
You'll get a shovel,
a howe, and a wheelcart.

438
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,346
Glad to be rid of that junk.

439
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,505
You'll see ...

440
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,465
With everybody lending a hand,
you'll move in in 6 weeks.

441
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,707
Right.

442
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,504
I wanted to ask you,
how about this weekend?

443
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,859
Not good.

444
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,700
We're out of order then.

445
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,622
Hey, stay in line!

446
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,582
I just want to get to my apartment.

447
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,827
There's no apartment.
Just the doctor's office.

448
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,907
I'll be glad when that's over.

449
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,385
What's over when? How dare you?

450
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,262
What's the problem?

451
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,028
She's pressing ahead.

452
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:04,148
Do you always have to shop
during my office hours?

453
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,223
Can't you wait?

454
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,745
You know something?

455
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,588
In a few weeks I'll go shopping
whenever I want.

456
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,667
We bought a villa in the country.

457
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,939
Wait!

458
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,108
That means you're moving out?

459
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,222
It sure is muddy.

460
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,508
Right. We'll have an
asphalt road laid first thing.

461
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,419
Hurry!

462
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,258
Kirk to Entenprise.
Entenprise, come in.

463
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,869
Give me the phone, Philipp.

464
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,744
Come, give me a hand.

465
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,898
Can I search the planet
for intelligent life?

466
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,180
Sure, but you won't find any.

467
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,826
Don't scratch the new lacquer
with your dirty jacket.

468
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,908
I told you a hundred times,
that's like sandpaper.

469
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,821
Go search the planet, please.

470
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,780
Could be worse.

471
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,059
Hey, wait!

472
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:01,945
Stop!

473
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,458
Here, boy!

474
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,027
That stupid biking's got
to stop here and now.

475
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,626
Sweetie, coffee's ready.

476
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,028
It's getting cozy here.

477
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,865
Isn't it?

478
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,266
Sugar's in the cupboard.

479
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,145
You're a sweetheart.

480
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,978
I left the "Beautiful Housing"
magazine behind.

481
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,145
What?

482
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,903
"Beautiful Housing".

483
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,862
What do we need that for?

484
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,061
To see what we need for the house.

485
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,228
We need a magazine for that?

486
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,463
All I need is a kitchen.

487
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,507
And a toilet for processing.

488
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,424
I wondered -

489
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,065
- where's the toilet going to be?

490
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,819
Well.

491
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,666
It's going to be - it'll be inside.

492
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,180
I'll have to ask ...

493
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,626
I have to ask Meier for tips.

494
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:13,221
If you get your tips from Meier,
you'll call me "Old Lady" before long.

495
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,144
Come on, honey pie.
What do you take me for?

496
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,342
I'll get the magazine.

497
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,099
Nice.

498
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,344
My house.

499
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,909
Grüß Gott!

500
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,028
In the name of the community.

501
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,301
I'm the mayor. Kandler's the name.

502
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,661
Pleasure.

503
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,189
The boss around?

504
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,106
Yes.

505
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,589
Come on in.

506
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,781
Don't want to get dirty.

507
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,425
Grüß Gott.

508
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,508
Sorry, the dust here's the plague.

509
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,540
What?

510
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,180
The dust.

511
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:36,662
I just wanted to check on
the new Hinterholzers.

512
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,786
Can I offer you something?

513
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,548
Don't want to interrupt your work.

514
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,943
Nice here.

515
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,383
I wanted to ask you.

516
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,905
Does the house have a cellar?

517
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,343
Never had one.

518
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:01,063
We thought of putting a sauna, or ...

519
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,704
Forget the cellar.

520
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,180
Digging's not allowed here.

521
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,622
Who cares.
We'll sweat somewhere else.

522
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,941
If I hadn't accidentally found out ...

523
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:23,344
Honestly, doctor, I have to tell you
Mr. Krcal only told us last week.

524
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,301
When are they moving?

525
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,182
In 4 weeks, I think.

526
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,186
Good.

527
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,348
The apartment's perfect for
enlarging my office.

528
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,702
But the Krcals have the option to ...

529
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,583
I'm sure you'll find a way.

530
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,385
It's getting there.

531
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,500
Well ...

532
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,348
It's a little dreary.

533
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,146
Now. But in the summer,
with the pool here ...

534
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,624
Daddy -

535
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,583
- it's so boring out here.
Are we staying long?

536
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,861
If you're bored, help Mom.

537
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,105
Watch the fire.

538
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,629
There's enough to do.

539
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,261
I'll fix us some food. A can of soup.

540
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,339
Great!

541
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,381
I'll check what needs replacing.

542
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,499
Oh ... plenty.

543
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,103
Let's see ...

544
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,820
Ladies and gentlemen,
here in Hornberg -

545
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:45,148
- it's come to first conflicts between
villagers and journalists.

546
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,147
What seems to be the problem,
Mayor?

547
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,465
Shut up.

548
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,219
We want our peace,
and no TV punks.

549
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,183
How about the accusations of fraud -

550
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,029
- regarding your property sales?

551
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,743
Fuck you.

552
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,188
It's nobody's business to whom I sell.

553
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,585
And if the EC cancels the funds -

554
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,268
Mommy, mommy, I got electrocuted!

555
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,467
Can't you play normal,
like other children?

556
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,546
No.

557
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,265
Herbert, the cooker's dead.
Do we have a short?

558
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,904
What's up?

559
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,499
Oh ... nothing.

560
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,666
That was the fuse. Hold that.

561
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,227
I'll fix that in a jiffy.

562
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,939
Take care, sweetie.

563
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,823
Technically you're like a newborn.

564
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,939
That's the bad one. Mark it.

565
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,389
There, now.

566
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,350
Great. Soup's done in a minute.

567
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,021
Why's that hillbilly music on so loud?

568
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,698
Oh, no. He's scribbling on the walls.

569
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,785
How are we going to wallpaper?
Just so I can match the curtains.

570
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,667
Textured, I guess.

571
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,100
That's fairly neutral.

572
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,223
The walls aren't bad.
Might have to scrape them off.

573
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,026
Sweetie, look!

574
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,266
I think we have another short.

575
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,347
Didn't you see me light up?

576
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,500
I don't believe it.

577
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,105
Stay away from the walls.
Get away!

578
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,465
That's not really a solution.

579
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,707
There must be a blank cable.
We'll get it fixed.

580
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,378
Oh, no!
Is everything going to be chiseled?

581
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,466
Chiseled?

582
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,859
Never.

583
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,665
We'll just insulate.

584
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,026
Hi. So glad you've come.

585
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,019
Polish fir flooring. Grooveless.

586
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,142
Square meter only 59.90.

587
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,978
Sorry. Listen -

588
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,103
- can you tell me where
the floor boards are?

589
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,984
No. I only look like I work here.

590
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,629
But I work here.

591
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,900
Good. Then you can tell me -

592
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,499
- I have some
electricity in the walls -

593
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,827
- and I wonder if waterproof
wallpaper insulates it.

594
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,029
I work in the
floor board department.

595
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,818
Oh, well ...

596
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,590
Mom, you have to tell us if Philipp's
too much for you.

597
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,385
Come on, one dwarf more or less.

598
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:10,499
Philipp likes it here with grandma,
just like our René.

599
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,179
He'd only bother you working.
This is best for everybody.

600
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,658
Except for us.

601
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,666
But there always has to be
the underdog.

602
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,020
Don't be like that!

603
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,428
After a day with Philipp,

604
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,622
it looks like
the Russians trampled through.

605
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,543
René's such a good boy,
since starting private school.

606
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,819
And anyway -

607
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,222
- that house was a stupid idea.

608
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,864
You would have gotten
our summer house some day.

609
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,947
But you can't compare that, Dad.

610
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,345
Right. My house has a roof -

611
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,586
- windowglass and a toilet.

612
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,981
We're getting a new toilet bowl.

613
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,780
Special sales offer.

614
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,589
You'll need it now.

615
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,182
I don't see your house happening.

616
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,070
But Herbert's working like a madman.

617
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,339
Exactly.

618
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,427
Willi just means,
Herbert's no handyman.

619
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,987
Remember the problems he had
with Philipp's playhouse?

620
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,465
Building really is bothersome.

621
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:17,068
Just think of the problems Willi
had at the subway construction.

622
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,818
I think Willi ought to look
at the house.

623
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,826
Gladly.

624
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,583
When it's finished.

625
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,987
Energy, energy!
Where are the Klingons?

626
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,141
Stay away
from the dwarves, little rat!

627
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,302
Hi, everyone!

628
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,063
That's how fast things change.

629
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,745
From Lagerfeld to Levi's.

630
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,304
Stop it, Willi.

631
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,940
We're proud of you anyway.

632
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,461
Let me tell you something ...

633
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,228
How often do I have to tell you -

634
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,228
- don't lean against the wall.

635
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,382
I'm in the current, Herbert.

636
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:59,309
My God, I'm in the current.

637
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:02,104
There's no current left, honey.

638
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,664
You're sure?
- Sure I'm sure.

639
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,788
The fuse blew.

640
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,544
Thank God.

641
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,509
I'm sick and tired of this.

642
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,860
Tomorrow we'll insulate
with the wallpaper.

643
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,779
No!

644
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,748
Definitely not!

645
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,101
I'm not having that
crummy wallpaper here.

646
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,864
Listen, you ...

647
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,624
I'm tired, my back aches,
my hands are blistered.

648
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,583
Look, honey -

649
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,430
- we'll have to grit our teeth
for half a year.

650
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,421
Then things'll look different.

651
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,983
Not only "things", Herbert.

652
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,504
We, too.

653
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,426
Don't be so realistic.

654
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,108
Le'ts do some more sanding.

655
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,659
Phantastic.

656
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,383
We'll break through here.

657
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,628
A second waiting room.

658
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,460
Blood lab.

659
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,499
And here is ...

660
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,588
I've prepared your written notice.

661
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,223
As of the first.

662
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,423
That might work, huh, sweetie?

663
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,708
About our option ...

664
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,987
We have someone offering us
100.000 for the place.

665
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,942
Right. We have the option to
pass on the apartment.

666
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,788
But Mr. Krcal -

667
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,579
- don't you know
the new housing law?

668
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,145
Daddy -

669
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,147
- I don't want to go
to the country today.

670
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,102
Can I go to grandpa?

671
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,538
No way!

672
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,264
I'm not buying
5 new dwarves each week.

673
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,825
What about the new rental law?

674
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,387
100.000 is unrealistic.
You know that.

675
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,785
Here's 40.000.

676
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,784
In cash.

677
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,019
Can I go to grandma?
- No, that's final.

678
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,140
Please.

679
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,501
Herbert, say something!

680
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,259
For God's sake,
we'll take you to grandma.

681
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,426
Super.
- Thanks.

682
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,099
You're welcome.

683
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,628
This is not a good time to discuss -

684
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,548
- we really have to ...

685
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,469
We have to think ...

686
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,868
Don't save on the dwarves.

687
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,306
A big hand for Workman!

688
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,626
Watch today's thrilling episode -

689
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,583
- "In the lee of the floorgrinder"

690
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,659
After wanking the plank this
dim October morning -

691
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,899
- I knew -

692
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,783
- today's the day of the
rotten floor boards.

693
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,026
Turn old to new,
as the signs of time signal.

694
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,222
What a wanker.

695
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,421
They don't really believe
that anybody here -

696
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,423
- is going to buy a single nail
because of that nerd.

697
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,745
Maybe not nails.

698
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,942
But the floorgrinders'll
sell like hotcakes.

699
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,186
You've got to find
those dumbheads first.

700
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,103
Who's that?

701
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:29,019
The redheaded cashier asked me,
before she melted away -

702
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,659
- if I wanted to insure the grinder.

703
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,622
So what?
Insurance is cowardly.

704
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,546
What's the ruckus about?
The floor grinder?

705
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,788
No. The lady on it.

706
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,979
Now the pissed-on corners
needed grinding.

707
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,021
A dusty job.

708
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,139
I finally took off my dinner jacket.

709
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,339
Sealing the brand new floor
was just a formality.

710
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,749
Wow!

711
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,379
Great body!

712
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,909
Take it off!

713
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,666
Right!

714
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,269
Take it all off!

715
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,109
Because who wants to get an itch -

716
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,141
- after doing a number
or two on the floor.

717
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,183
Are you nuts?

718
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,346
Are you sick in the head?

719
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,189
He's too young for that.
Did you get the garbage bags?

720
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,301
No. Anything else?

721
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,545
What?

722
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,709
I'll go with you.

723
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,026
Should I get the fuses?

724
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,663
No. I'll get them.

725
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,265
Herbert -

726
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,308
- don't forget.
- No!

727
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,628
On returning the grinder -

728
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,749
- I got a check for a million dollars.

729
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,779
I was the 22.633rd customer
of the month.

730
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,228
For the prize money I bought
a plastic pail -

731
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,900
- and poured the
redheaded cashier into it.

732
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,906
I'm sure it'll be a wet night tonight.

733
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,026
Are you nuts? You're confusing
my stage for a peep show.

734
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,506
We said that's staying up.
Besides, I'm the star here.

735
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,184
Are you sure?

736
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,898
Thank you.

737
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,299
Floorgrinder?

738
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,346
Yes.

739
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,104
Insurance?

740
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,540
Insurance is cowardly.

741
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,021
Right. - O.K.

742
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,582
Careful! The dustbag.

743
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,266
Oh, no!

744
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,509
Don't say anything.

745
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,465
Oh, shit!

746
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,549
What happened?

747
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,465
Nothing. I'm grinding us a cellar.

748
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,828
It looked so easy,
when Workman did it.

749
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,065
Listen, you ...

750
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:03,662
Away from the wall!

751
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,544
Will you please not shout?

752
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,745
Oh, no.

753
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:32,062
Don't give up on me.

754
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:34,068
I'm not insured.

755
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,783
Haven't I told you -

756
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,629
- a hundred times
not to lean on the wall?

757
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:44,298
I would have noticed, if I had.

758
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,740
You're already immune
to electricity.

759
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,702
I'll get the fuses.

760
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,786
From where?
- From the car, or....?

761
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,427
Oh, no!
I especially reminded you at the shop.

762
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:02,269
You could have bought
the fucking fuses, too.

763
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,259
Five to 12.

764
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,585
Won't make it.

765
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,385
Kandler!

766
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:20,905
Thank God!

767
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,467
You saved me, Mr. Kandler.

768
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,819
Grüß Gott.

769
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,748
Hello, Mr. Kandler. What's up?

770
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:29,629
I need a fuse.
- Oh, shopping spree!

771
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,749
16 ampere.

772
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,699
Don't have any.

773
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,942
20 amps is O.K. too.

774
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,069
Don't have any at all. Monday.

775
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,864
Maybe you could look, if ...

776
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,068
No need to look.

777
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,861
Have a nice weekend.

778
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:51,469
Yeah. Right.

779
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,340
Really?

780
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,026
That's sweet of you.

781
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,865
Otherwise
everything'll go wrong here.

782
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:04,905
When are you coming?

783
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,183
I'll be there in an hour.
And looking forward to it!

784
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,588
We'll fix the fuse.

785
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:16,258
Who, we?

786
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:19,099
Take a wire. Let's go.

787
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,868
Hi, gorgeous.

788
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,388
Say "hello".
- Good day.

789
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:25,784
Stop babbling. Let's go.

790
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:30,783
Got a beer?

791
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:31,945
Sure.

792
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,138
Let's get this done.

793
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,901
I'll show you how it works.

794
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,621
You have to bridge the fuse.

795
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,829
Take a piece of wire -

796
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:43,743
- insulate it - like that.

797
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,941
You want a beer, too?
- No, he doesn't drink.

798
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:48,947
You make a "u" - O.K.

799
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,302
Then you hit the plus and minus.

800
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,106
Isn't that dangerous?
- Why should it be?

801
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,225
O.K.

802
00:45:58,590 --> 00:45:59,420
Here.

803
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:09,985
No juice.

804
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,379
Can't be.

805
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:17,699
Oh, no!

806
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:19,863
It's the main line.

807
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:22,630
Jesus! They've run out of juice!

808
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:26,539
I borrow a grinder for a ton of money,
and they run out of juice!

809
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,584
Is it working?

810
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,824
What'll we do now?

811
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,059
Wallpaper.

812
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:39,942
You know exactly that I don't want -

813
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:41,708
- that crummy wallpaper.

814
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:45,425
We'll wallpaper. With no electricity,
nothing can happen.

815
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,143
I'll help you.

816
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:49,467
We'll have it in a jiffy.

817
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,742
Keep him busy.

818
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,618
He's just standing here looking stupid.
- Right. Come on.

819
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:03,339
You, look.

820
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:06,548
Here shingle, ah, woodbricks for roof.

821
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:08,865
Follow me.

822
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:10,663
Here big hole -

823
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:13,588
- much shingle missing.

824
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:14,939
Many shingles.

825
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:17,988
What?
- Shingles. Plural.

826
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:19,699
Right.

827
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:23,422
Ladder, shingles, and ...

828
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:27,818
Him again?!

829
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,065
Asshole!

830
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,380
Gaudy, but to the point.

831
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:37,469
Get on the ladder,
and I'll show you how.

832
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,665
Right up there, yeah.

833
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,982
You hold it like that.

834
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:46,023
Then you straighten it.

835
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:51,380
I'll check down here.

836
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:54,744
Then I'll smoothe it.

837
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,178
Oops, sorry.

838
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:58,421
What is this?

839
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:01,824
Can't you do it alone?
- Sure.

840
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,460
But work ought to be fun.

841
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,987
If you touch me again -

842
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:11,547
The Bosnian's on the roof.

843
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:14,389
How do you like it?

844
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:16,619
Crooked.

845
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,341
Just a little.
- Sure is.

846
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,587
Not concentrated, were you?

847
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:25,862
What's all this childish needling?

848
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:29,386
What?

849
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:31,945
What's with her?

850
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:36,186
It's all a little much for her.

851
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:39,183
But it is crooked.

852
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,301
We can fix it, as long as it's wet.

853
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:46,985
Right.

854
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:52,821
You just have to be careful.

855
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,339
Now gently.

856
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:03,188
I don't believe it.

857
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,946
You working hard, huh?

858
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,547
Non-union worker, huh?

859
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:15,866
Yes.

860
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:18,341
60 Shillings an hour.

861
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,468
Here's my card.

862
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,948
And the number of the refugee camp.

863
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:28,224
Boss say you dig cellar?

864
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,820
A cellar on the roof?
You're joking.

865
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,258
Don't get sassy.

866
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,139
No digging here.

867
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:36,419
Water conservatory.

868
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:40,340
Won't take long.
Quick cement, done in a jiffy.

869
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,224
Hello, men.

870
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:45,979
Hope I'm not interrupting.
- Not at all.

871
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:51,343
What can I do for you?

872
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,541
I'd like a beer. I have to go soon.

873
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:54,944
A beer for me, too.

874
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:59,505
By the way, it wasn't the fuses.

875
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,025
The main lines were dead.

876
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:03,459
We know that.

877
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:04,904
I have to go to my parents.

878
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,463
Immediatly.
- Why?

879
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:08,821
Is something wrong with Philipp?
- Yes.

880
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:12,222
He beamed away 12 of Dad's dwarves
with the leafeater.

881
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:16,390
Those leafeaters are great.
I got one, too.

882
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,742
Only Dad had a collapse.

883
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,949
Here's the car key.

884
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,068
Put a blanket on the seat.
'Cause of the dirt.

885
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,345
Madam,

886
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,660
the woodwork of the roof -

887
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,469
- is rotten.

888
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:39,349
One chimney's O.K. but the other ...

889
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,538
Please tell my husband.
I'm in a hurry.

890
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,107
This chimney's defect,

891
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,029
the other's O.K.

892
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:18,103
Wise guy.

893
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:20,945
We go home.

894
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:22,299
As you wish.

895
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:27,940
Bye.

896
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:34,338
I'll need my drill next week-end.

897
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,508
Everything'll be alright.

898
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:06,223
Greetings, Lord of the Castle!

899
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:08,990
What's up?
My favorite sister-in-law called me.

900
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:10,543
Great.
- Where's the little wife?

901
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:12,468
Gone.
- Too bad.

902
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:14,269
Well, let's have a look.

903
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:18,459
Goodness gracious, you dive-bomber.

904
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,309
It's all up and rising,
as the builders call it.

905
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:25,110
Only
you shouldn't start baking a cake -

906
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,222
- by sticking candles into the eggs.

907
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:29,983
That's too soon.

908
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:33,500
Active walls - all sweaty.

909
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:36,904
It might upset you, friend,
but you'll have to clean them.

910
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:40,022
Clean them away.
With the caterpillar.

911
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:42,949
That's more efficient,
my desperate brother-in-law.

912
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:45,302
One more thing -

913
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:46,983
- dig a cellar.

914
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,698
So you'll have a place to cry in.

915
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:59,027
All is Roger, all is rabbit.
Chin up.

916
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:01,266
Maybe you'll find a gold
mine while digging.

917
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:04,781
Or at least the leak in your pipes,
the way it smells here. Got it?

918
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,702
We're through, Ma'am.

919
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:20,338
Great!

920
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,862
A deal is a deal.

921
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:32,425
I need to stick to my schedule.

922
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:34,461
No problem.

923
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,103
Here, the mail.

924
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,109
Good bye.
- Bye.

925
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:43,267
The fresh air will sure do you good.
- Right.

926
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,629
Put your things out in the tool shack.

927
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,501
It's not really equipped for the cold.

928
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:58,985
That's why we always move
to town in October.

929
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:05,186
But it's nice and peaceful here.

930
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,264
How's Dad?

931
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:12,501
Fine, under the circumstances.

932
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,302
Bye. Till next year.

933
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:16,940
Look.

934
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,987
The builder's estimate.

935
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:23,585
Not too bad.

936
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,745
Stop!

937
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:54,703
The walls stay up.

938
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:57,425
Now you tell me?

939
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:01,821
I'm sure we'll find a solution.

940
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:04,305
In any case we should extend
the term to 20 years.

941
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,341
For more flexibility.

942
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:08,347
We should also be careful -

943
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:11,110
- not to overextend your means.

944
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:14,387
Let's look at a compromise -

945
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:17,229
- between an insurance loan
with a fixed -

946
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:20,467
- and a mortgage
with variable interest.

947
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:24,504
That leaves us with 7.78%
and 13% approximately.

948
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:28,182
An increase of
500.000 shillings means -

949
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:32,342
- monthly rates of something
I ike 16.689.

950
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,098
Yeah, well -

951
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:41,668
- there's no way out.

952
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:43,503
O.K. Where do I sign?

953
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,621
You can't sign just yet.

954
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:47,779
We'd need -

955
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:51,187
- some securities.
Do you have pictures of the house?

956
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,150
Come on, not the old ones.

957
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:00,778
These are the new ones.
What's with you?

958
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:05,906
Oh, isn't that sweet.

959
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:08,105
Sure. Why not.

960
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:10,146
Yeah.

961
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:11,140
O.K.

962
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:20,864
Well, now ...

963
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:23,666
Save, save, save's the word.

964
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:27,060
We'll all have to do our share.

965
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:31,582
Everything lately sounds
like an accusation.

966
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:36,543
Definitely not.
What do you mean "accusation"?

967
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:38,509
No accusation at all.

968
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,946
I just wonder,
what you've contributed so far.

969
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,260
I don't want to imply that...
- That what?

970
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:47,019
That I quit work when Philipp was
born and you support me?

971
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:49,869
No. Not at all.

972
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:53,259
But you learned a trade, didn't you?

973
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:57,826
I can't take this grunting any more.
Especially not in bed.

974
00:56:58,590 --> 00:56:59,784
Listen ...

975
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,900
Daddy, I want my own room again.

976
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:04,702
Be quiet and go to sleep.

977
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:06,787
But I want to lie with Mommy.

978
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,309
No way.

979
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:10,785
Come here.
Dad's sleeping on the couch.

980
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:22,426
You learned cosmetics
and pedicure, Mrs. ...

981
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:23,699
Krcal.

982
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,539
Did you practice it?

983
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,344
Sure.

984
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:32,704
You just wouldn't believe
the applicants we have.

985
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,500
You mind if I look
over your shoulder?

986
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:38,746
You can even look at your toes.

987
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:44,788
As I said,
we can't pay more than 17.000.

988
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,868
But you can keep all the tips.

989
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:52,589
I hate to say it,
but your hands look awful.

990
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,269
We're building, you know.

991
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:02,219
You have to start calculating better.

992
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:05,384
I'm trying.
Know anyone who needs a mobile?

993
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:07,348
Dump that old thing.

994
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:10,663
Are you really letting a
builder tear down your house?

995
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:11,980
Well,

996
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,021
I want to do it right
if I'm gonna do it.

997
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:17,500
That was a dumb thing,
trying to muddle through things.

998
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:21,068
Especially now
that the bank's backing me.

999
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:25,827
You only build a house once
in a lifetime. Me, at least.

1000
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:29,909
But you're having a builder do it?
I'll be darned.

1001
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:31,345
Have to.

1002
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:35,783
Because of the rebuilding loan.
No receipts, no loan.

1003
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:38,178
Are you nuts?

1004
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:39,749
You know what that costs?

1005
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:42,021
They'll charge you an arm and a leg.

1006
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:44,069
No, never.

1007
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,061
He's totally fair.

1008
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,061
That builder's out of his mind.
He's nuts.

1009
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:57,023
My God, he's doubled the estimate.

1010
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:59,585
He's asking 98.000.

1011
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:02,463
Not in your life.
I'll sue him, just wait.

1012
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:06,629
They're all crooks in the
construction business.

1013
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:08,866
Just as crooked as car dealers.

1014
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:13,499
The phone!

1015
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:17,186
Not with me!

1016
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,869
They're not there now.

1017
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:20,625
I don't care.

1018
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:27,859
I'll show him.

1019
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:29,549
He'll get his.

1020
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:32,226
I'll go on the radio, on a talk show.

1021
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:36,105
He'll find out who he's dealing with.

1022
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:38,986
I'll get those crooks!

1023
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:42,386
Not with me!

1024
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:44,899
Maybe you can talk to him.

1025
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:46,385
Talk to him?

1026
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:49,982
Those crooks
only understand one language.

1027
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:51,940
Please!

1028
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,981
You have to give me a discount.

1029
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:56,898
O.K. 75.000.

1030
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:58,100
Super.

1031
00:59:58,310 --> 00:59:59,663
But, of course ...

1032
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:02,745
No receipt.
- No, just a minute. I need one -

1033
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:05,498
- for the rebuilding loan. Well, O.K.

1034
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:08,630
And what about the wall you
accidentally pulled down?

1035
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:10,388
Can't say accidentally.

1036
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,061
It'll make a great patio.

1037
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:16,223
Yeah, sure.

1038
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:19,709
I could clear away the rubble.

1039
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:21,339
If you want.

1040
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:22,824
How much'll that cost me?

1041
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:25,189
Around 8000.

1042
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:27,309
But, of course ...
- No receipt, I know.

1043
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:34,822
Asshole!

1044
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:42,618
Can I ask you something personal,
Silvia?

1045
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:45,700
Because ...

1046
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:47,059
Herbert -

1047
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,460
- starts acting so funny.

1048
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:51,742
So strange.

1049
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:56,349
When you were building,
did your husband change?

1050
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:57,426
No.

1051
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,706
He's always been stupid.

1052
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:05,661
8000 for clearing away rubble?
Bullshit.

1053
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,178
You know something?

1054
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:11,310
I'll lend you my old horse trailer
for the rubble.

1055
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,307
Then you take it out
where nobody knows you.

1056
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:15,348
But that's illegal.

1057
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,825
If they catch you, you're hung.

1058
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:19,903
Oh, shut up.

1059
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:22,823
Can we please leave?

1060
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,022
Look, the old lady's wacky.

1061
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,068
She's on the ecology trip.

1062
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:31,546
Do you think it's normal to clean
an engine in the garden?

1063
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,308
If you don't shut up -

1064
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:36,744
- I'll do an oil change
on your cucumbers.

1065
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,622
Those are zucchini.

1066
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,542
What?
- Zucchini.

1067
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:45,023
Who gives a shit?

1068
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:49,139
Anyway, we all did it like that.

1069
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:53,338
A little night trip -

1070
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:56,266
- and no more rubble.

1071
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:00,663
Just imagine how the forest looked.

1072
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:08,030
The locals came to pick mushrooms - 
and went home and baked the styrofoam.

1073
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:14,824
Hey, Dad. Was that a wolf howling?

1074
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:17,345
No, the clutch. Now be quiet.

1075
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:24,663
Look over there.
There's a perfect spot.

1076
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,543
It's a dumb idea.

1077
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:27,944
Quit it.

1078
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:32,660
Listen, Philipp -

1079
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:35,748
- quit playing around
with the flashlight.

1080
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:39,659
Batteries are expensive,
and we're not swimming in dough.

1081
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:42,783
I'm working up a sweat.

1082
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:45,418
Will you please put my
jacket in the trunk?

1083
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:47,465
You want a sandwich?

1084
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:49,547
What? No, later.

1085
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,025
Philippi,

1086
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:52,106
sandwich?

1087
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:56,425
Forget it.

1088
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,468
Sweetie ...
- Watch out!

1089
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:11,260
What?

1090
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:15,942
Willi knows someone who'll do
the brick construction for 400.000.

1091
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:17,139
Listen ...

1092
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:19,382
It'll be up in a jiffy, Willi said.

1093
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:22,058
I'm sure Willi gets it up in a jiffy.

1094
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:24,542
Are you nuts or something?

1095
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:25,745
Me?

1096
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:28,187
Need I mention Mallorca?

1097
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:31,700
How often do I have to tell you?
It was nothing.

1098
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:34,708
We really had engine trouble
with the boat.

1099
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:36,668
The whole night?

1100
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:40,503
I think that chapter is really closed.

1101
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:46,429
For me. But apparently not for Willi.

1102
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:55,182
Good night.
- Bye now.

1103
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:57,308
Drive carefully, guys.

1104
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:03,985
The situation in the Styrian village
of Hornberg is coming to a climax.

1105
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:06,545
After the arrest of the mayor -

1106
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,503
- the Department of Finance
is demanding -

1107
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:13,106
- strict control of property sales
in the entire region.

1108
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:16,422
Can't be long now.
Just a matter of time.

1109
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:18,229
That's what I say.

1110
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:21,748
Kandler should have never sold
that house.

1111
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:23,588
But money's all important.

1112
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:27,385
They shouldn't have ever permitted
to build anything there.

1113
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,621
But those were other times.

1114
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:31,185
Still ...

1115
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:34,264
Something wrong?
- No. Keep quiet.

1116
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:43,786
Honey, get me my jacket, please.

1117
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:45,139
Are you cold?

1118
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:47,540
No, but the car key's in it.

1119
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:49,018
Come on, Philipp.

1120
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:51,745
We're leaving.
You've to get to school.

1121
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:55,660
Sweetie -

1122
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:58,430
- does the power lock
shut the trunk, too?

1123
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:00,905
Sure.
The Japs have all extras included.

1124
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:02,862
All windows streetside.

1125
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:09,785
Why?

1126
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:11,299
Tell me, why -

1127
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:14,388
- did you close the trunk?

1128
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:18,380
And why did you lock the car?

1129
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:29,186
Which is the cheapest glass?

1130
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:30,584
The mirror.

1131
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,502
Please get away. Just move.

1132
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:40,544
Sweetie,
shouldn't we call Triple "A"?

1133
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:44,986
Just move out of the way.

1134
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:46,789
Move!

1135
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:53,498
Now get this, you ...

1136
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:56,829
Can't believe
I'm smashing my own car.

1137
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:01,618
Move, please.

1138
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:04,819
This way to Sulz,
this way to Kaltenleutgeben.

1139
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:08,386
Spread out, but get away from me
as far as you can.

1140
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:09,989
And you open up!

1141
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:13,864
Not with me!

1142
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:16,984
Open up!

1143
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:21,823
You know
what you cost me each month?

1144
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,182
Done. Let's go.

1145
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:05,428
Where to, Mister?

1146
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:11,379
Hi.

1147
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:13,466
You already murdered today?

1148
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:15,665
Not yet.

1149
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:18,342
Is that your garbage?

1150
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:21,344
This isn't garbage.

1151
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:23,506
It's my prefabricated house.

1152
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:26,463
Just layed it out
to see if it's complete.

1153
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:28,548
Being funny, huh?

1154
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:30,660
Yeah.

1155
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:32,508
That'll cost you.

1156
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:34,304
Oh yeah?

1157
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:39,183
A customer for you.

1158
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:41,098
V.I.P.

1159
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:46,464
Hello, my lovely.

1160
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:47,699
Good day ...

1161
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:51,141
Aren't you the one from the
hardware megastore?

1162
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:53,505
This ... "Workman"?

1163
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:56,344
The very same.
What a coincidence.

1164
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:58,259
Please, Mister ...

1165
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:03,105
Leave out the "Workman", sweet one.
Call me Stephan.

1166
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:09,348
Grüß Gott, Mister!

1167
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:14,820
Told you, it would cost you.

1168
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:16,709
You damned rapist of nature!

1169
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:19,140
No! Please! It was Meier's idea.

1170
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:23,621
I paid the fine anyway.
7000 shillings.

1171
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:27,463
Please! It was Meier's fault!

1172
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:31,065
It can't go on like that, Mr. Krcal.

1173
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:33,541
Besides, it was Meier's trailer.

1174
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:36,542
We should have a talk.

1175
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:38,348
Come to my office.

1176
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:45,582
You know, we're up to our necks
with that house.

1177
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:49,905
I do feel a little responsible -

1178
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:51,907
- for your miserable situation, Margit.

1179
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:53,420
Come on ...

1180
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:54,699
But surely!

1181
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:58,506
My realistic stage performance
often leads people -

1182
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:00,223
- to do things they'll regret later.

1183
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:04,063
Not everyone can build a house.

1184
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:07,740
We can't go on like this anyway.

1185
01:09:08,070 --> 01:09:09,469
You agree?

1186
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:14,264
Sure.
We can't go on like this any more.

1187
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:17,622
I live in a summer cabin,
which wouldn't be bad -

1188
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:21,824
- if it weren't the end of November.
And if the heater worked.

1189
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:25,825
Margit, my wife,
now cleans toenails as a fulltime job.

1190
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:29,306
The boy is in an institution,
a boarding school ...

1191
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:32,383
I mean, we had to put him away.

1192
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,019
He always tries beaming
the teacher away.

1193
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:37,505
Which, naturally,
disturbs class a little.

1194
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:41,230
So he brings home notes from school.

1195
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:45,543
Doesn't matter. Signs
them himself anyway. With "Kirk".

1196
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:48,667
But nobody notices.

1197
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:50,543
Looks just like "Krcal".

1198
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,627
Neither one of them
talk to me anymore.

1199
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:56,061
The boy, because he
doesn't deal with Klingons -

1200
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:59,740
- and Margit, because last Friday
I called her "old lady".

1201
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:04,059
Had a blank.
Her name just slipped my mind.

1202
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:06,705
It isn't easy with him right now.

1203
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:09,583
He always hangs out
with his cronies and -

1204
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:11,389
- is always bad-tempered.

1205
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,547
Dearest, I'm so very sorry for you.

1206
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:16,343
May I take you out to dinner?

1207
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:19,102
No ...

1208
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:21,745
That's sweet of you, but -

1209
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:24,146
- I can't get a bite down.
Feel an oncoming ulcer.

1210
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:30,422
I'll have it checked soon
as the roof's up.

1211
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:34,502
You have my sympathy, Mr. Krcal.

1212
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:36,940
But you have
to pull yourself together.

1213
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:38,699
Because otherwise ...

1214
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:39,708
Right.

1215
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:40,900
I can assure you that ...

1216
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:42,259
Sorry, just a second.

1217
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:53,500
But why?

1218
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:56,147
You can't do that.

1219
01:10:57,630 --> 01:10:59,348
But l, maybe ... hold on.

1220
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:04,185
Could I maybe have this afternoon off,
Mr. Spitz?

1221
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:06,862
It's really an emergency.

1222
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:11,468
I think we have to be objective,
Mr. Krcal.

1223
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:12,898
What you own is a ruin.

1224
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:17,259
An expert of the regional
council went by to -

1225
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:21,782
- check your ...
let's call it "house" -

1226
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:24,663
- and felt it doesn't comply.

1227
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:25,782
What?

1228
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:29,541
I don't believe it.

1229
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:34,222
Listen! I bought
building material for 260.000.

1230
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:36,629
How do you expect me to pay that?

1231
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:39,661
A valid question indeed.

1232
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:44,939
Can't you just readjust the loan?

1233
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:46,948
We'd need securities.

1234
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:48,186
Securities?

1235
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:50,426
But you already own the house!

1236
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:51,665
O.K. I mean -

1237
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:54,509
- your house is no security,
its a life-time project.

1238
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:56,019
Good bye, Sir.

1239
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:57,946
Where were we?

1240
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:00,983
Oh, yes. Have you thought about -

1241
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:03,829
- selling the property?

1242
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:08,621
No. Impossible.

1243
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:12,749
Please,
you've got to recalculate somehow.

1244
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:14,864
I don't see ...

1245
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:16,981
Hold on.

1246
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:19,708
I just saw something.

1247
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,904
Let me congratulate you on
behalf of our institute.

1248
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:25,908
Happy birthday!

1249
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:28,349
For your house key.

1250
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:56,424
Hi, neighbour.

1251
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:57,983
I've got something.

1252
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:01,905
Bread for your horse.

1253
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:09,586
Thanks.

1254
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:12,226
You are the son-in-law?

1255
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:14,225
Bye!

1256
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:15,939
Good bye.

1257
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:29,262
If we're lucky,
we'll do the last haul today.

1258
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:31,779
What's the matter?

1259
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:33,659
Something wrong?

1260
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:35,546
Go on!

1261
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:39,502
Birthday surprise.

1262
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:45,065
Car keys.

1263
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:46,829
Car papers.

1264
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:47,860
What?

1265
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:51,389
12 months no payments, Mr. Krcal.

1266
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:52,827
Jesus!

1267
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:03,262
I'll take the car now.

1268
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:05,349
Sure, go ahead.

1269
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:07,945
Holy cow!

1270
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:09,862
Slipped with the key or something?

1271
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,503
It's insured anyway.

1272
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:14,779
That's willful destruction.

1273
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:16,904
Not loaded.

1274
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:19,509
You'll pay for this.

1275
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:22,460
Each little scratch.

1276
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:36,909
Shit!

1277
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,021
They're really taking my car.

1278
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:01,100
What kind of life is this?

1279
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:04,265
I can't go on, Herbert.

1280
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:06,505
Well ...

1281
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:08,828
What's wrong with Mommy?

1282
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:12,382
Nothing. She's got a headache.
Now finish your meal.

1283
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:15,707
Should I get her beamed up
to the clinic?

1284
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:20,104
Kirk to Entenprise.
Come in, Entenprise.

1285
01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:21,909
Stop it. I'm O.K.

1286
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:30,622
They wouldn't have cancelled the loan
if you had gotten receipts.

1287
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:34,018
That's bullshit.

1288
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:37,859
But it's true. You're dragging
us down in the dirt with you.

1289
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:40,186
How about shutting your trap, huh?

1290
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:44,702
Please, not in front of the boy.

1291
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:53,828
Hi! Anybody home?

1292
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:07,778
We're singing a song for Herbert -

1293
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,269
- Herbert -

1294
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:17,985
- you asshole -

1295
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:21,382
Bottoms up! Cheers!

1296
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:26,148
Birthday surprise, wanker!

1297
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:27,863
I don't believe it.

1298
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:30,865
Hi, Margit.

1299
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:32,185
Please, don't.

1300
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:41,668
Careful, tricky stuff.

1301
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:50,942
Ex or asshole!

1302
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:01,508
Not bad.

1303
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:04,900
And what about your present?

1304
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:07,744
What present?

1305
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:11,779
Us!

1306
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:14,546
We're coming -

1307
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:16,342
- next weekend we're there.

1308
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,903
Special task force.

1309
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:20,906
We'll be ready Saturday morning -

1310
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:22,429
- 8 o'clock at your door.

1311
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:24,982
I don't have a door yet.

1312
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:30,949
How about a swig?

1313
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:37,338
I think your old lady's
got the hots for me.

1314
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:41,503
We could trade partners
New Years Eve.

1315
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:42,586
Herbert, please!

1316
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:44,269
Great idea.

1317
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:46,188
Who're you gonna trade?

1318
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,781
Are you just going to stand there?

1319
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:50,867
We're just having fun.

1320
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:55,146
Your old lady's pretty fucked up.

1321
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:57,468
You nuts or something?

1322
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:58,825
No shit!

1323
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:01,979
Come here, Philipp.

1324
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:09,144
I'm getting a divorce.

1325
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:10,944
What's wrong now?

1326
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:14,422
What do you mean?

1327
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:16,861
Let her go. She'll come back.

1328
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:24,186
Come here. Sit with us.

1329
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:25,506
Sit!

1330
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:26,427
Come on.

1331
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:31,741
Tell me, what's going on here?

1332
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:32,906
Nothing.

1333
01:18:34,030 --> 01:18:35,509
I lost my car, too.

1334
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:39,826
Don't let it get you down.

1335
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:44,982
But they can't just take my car.

1336
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:49,459
How am I going to get to Hinterholz?

1337
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:55,182
Good question.

1338
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:10,541
Now the mobile's fucked.

1339
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:14,065
Shit!

1340
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:28,501
And I'm out of change.

1341
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:30,942
Grüß Gott, Mr. Krcal.

1342
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:32,465
Hello, there.

1343
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:34,262
How're you doing?

1344
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:36,788
Would you have some coins for me?

1345
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:38,742
Oh, dear. Sure!

1346
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:40,459
Just for the phone.

1347
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:42,865
Is a ten O.K.?

1348
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:47,659
Mitzi, how could you?

1349
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,866
Hi. It's Herbert.

1350
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:53,865
How're things?

1351
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:55,384
Better?

1352
01:19:56,590 --> 01:19:57,466
Fine.

1353
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:01,659
Could I talk to Margit,
I mean, my wife?

1354
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:07,420
Can't be that she doesn't
want to talk to me.

1355
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:11,386
You know what:

1356
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:13,547
I'll just come by tonight, and ...

1357
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:18,906
Are you all nuts or something?

1358
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,422
Here's nothing to stare at!

1359
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:37,547
I'll sue you, you ...

1360
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:49,823
Howdy, wankers!

1361
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:53,701
Hi. Your new abode.

1362
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:56,669
And your new car.

1363
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:58,383
Runs like a bunny!

1364
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:02,669
And if you fix the brakes,
it'll even stop.

1365
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:06,299
Wait ...

1366
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:09,664
Get out.

1367
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:12,139
Say "hello".

1368
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:14,144
Good morning, Mr. Krcal.

1369
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:14,987
Hi there, Mr. ...

1370
01:21:15,190 --> 01:21:17,340
Glad to help you out again.

1371
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:18,903
Don't gab.

1372
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:22,907
Quite a change, since last time.

1373
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:31,583
I'll tell you something.

1374
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:34,179
Folks like that are unpredictable.

1375
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:36,462
I'll take care of him.

1376
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:37,899
It'll be O.K.

1377
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:38,781
Sure.

1378
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:40,946
It's already in the papers:

1379
01:21:41,390 --> 01:21:44,826
"German TV lifts secret of Hornberg!"

1380
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:46,907
"What are the villagers holding back?"

1381
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:50,109
Skeletons in the closet
always mean trouble.

1382
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:51,629
Relax, Mitzi.

1383
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:53,907
But it's true.
- Now quit it!

1384
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:56,221
We'll end up on TV, too.

1385
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:58,984
What if he starts digging after all?

1386
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:00,543
He's not going to.

1387
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:03,379
Now no more talk of it.

1388
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:04,261
Cheers!

1389
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:08,781
Did I promise too much?

1390
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:10,708
Quick as a jiffy.

1391
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:14,061
But digging's not allowed here.

1392
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:16,304
Dumb ass!

1393
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:19,989
You can dig all you want
on your own property.

1394
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:22,142
Things'll look up now.

1395
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:28,062
Sure. Got it right here.

1396
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:31,183
The trailer's less.

1397
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:33,301
It's my brother's. Only 3 grand.

1398
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:37,219
But I only have ...

1399
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:39,629
Can't I just borrow it?

1400
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:43,225
He's glad to be rid of it!

1401
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:45,699
O.K. then.

1402
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:50,110
What about him?
What does he want?

1403
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:52,304
His name's Iso.

1404
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:53,505
What?

1405
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:54,461
Iso.

1406
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:57,428
Pretty short name, eh?

1407
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:59,746
Probably can't remember
a longer one.

1408
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:04,462
"Meier's" no tongue-twister either.
- What?

1409
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:09,899
Your jokes are just as dumb
as your old lady's.

1410
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:11,907
Ex-old lady.
- What?

1411
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:14,302
Oh yeah, right.

1412
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:16,782
Good riddance, anyway.

1413
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:19,264
She wasn't exactly ugly.

1414
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:25,138
Now get out of here!

1415
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:26,622
What?

1416
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:29,742
Go fuck off!

1417
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:31,943
I'll be damned!

1418
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:36,105
Come on!

1419
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:37,499
Egghead.

1420
01:23:39,190 --> 01:23:40,066
By the way -

1421
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:43,662
- I hear you're getting fired.

1422
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:03,469
Why didn't I get a present
from Daddy?

1423
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,462
Maybe it's still coming.

1424
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:09,179
Maybe rubber boots and work gloves.

1425
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:14,899
I think the Boys' Choir is on.
Please look, Willi.

1426
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:17,704
Do we really have to listen
to those eunuchs?

1427
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:22,227
I think they're on before the news.

1428
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:23,943
After the news.

1429
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:25,982
Do you always have to be right?

1430
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:28,750
Relax, Dad. Think of your heart.

1431
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:30,385
Don't.

1432
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:32,269
I don't mind.

1433
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:34,068
You look so sad.

1434
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:37,542
Sorry. It's my first Christmas alone.

1435
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:39,547
Can't really call it "alone".

1436
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:42,310
Be glad you're rid of Herbert.

1437
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:45,384
No house,

1438
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:46,744
but debts.

1439
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,741
That's tough following.

1440
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:52,140
Specialist at work.

1441
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:56,866
sorry.

1442
01:24:57,470 --> 01:25:00,030
Forget it.
Maybe they're really after the news.

1443
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:05,020
Christmas or no Christmas -

1444
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:08,139
- your divorce
cost us a ton of money.

1445
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:11,748
So what? You want to take
your dough to the grave?

1446
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:13,826
Hey, Mom ...

1447
01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:14,906
Can we go soon?

1448
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:16,026
Sure.

1449
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:18,027
You want the car?
- What's up?

1450
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:20,184
Where are you going?

1451
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:25,506
Turn it up.

1452
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:15,343
Awesome.

1453
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:26,865
Merry Christmas.

1454
01:26:27,070 --> 01:26:28,185
Right.

1455
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:30,422
I mean, same here.

1456
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,105
How are you?

1457
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:33,380
O.K.

1458
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:35,187
And you?

1459
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:37,344
So, so.

1460
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:41,139
I'm starting the foundation now.

1461
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:44,299
I thought -

1462
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:46,102
- this is a water conservatory.

1463
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:49,988
I checked that. It's allright to dig.

1464
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:54,384
Are your good friends helping you?

1465
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:55,460
No.

1466
01:26:55,870 --> 01:26:58,304
I got rid of them.
You've seen the last of them.

1467
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:01,578
Who's helping you then?

1468
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:03,229
I'll help Dad.

1469
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:10,539
You got the shittiest trailer.

1470
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:16,382
You want to come in?

1471
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:18,706
It's a little warmer inside than out.

1472
01:27:20,830 --> 01:27:22,183
Welcome!

1473
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:24,028
Make yourselves at home.

1474
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:26,029
Sit down, Philipp.

1475
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:30,185
Hungry?

1476
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:32,702
Want some pickled herring?

1477
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:34,298
We've eaten already.

1478
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:37,466
Salmon and wild goose.

1479
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:40,299
Look, what Grandma gave me.

1480
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:42,142
A new space gun -

1481
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:43,824
- the Star Trek game ...

1482
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:45,065
Quit it.

1483
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:46,466
Look!

1484
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:48,908
An Entenprise shirt.

1485
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:52,070
It's "Enterprise", Uncle Willi said.

1486
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:55,547
Well, if Uncle Willi says so ...

1487
01:27:57,310 --> 01:27:59,062
Wait, I've got something for you.

1488
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:01,545
It's not wrapped yet, but -

1489
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:03,628
- get up a second.

1490
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:05,659
Right.

1491
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:08,779
Look, Margit.

1492
01:28:09,670 --> 01:28:10,147
Remember?

1493
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:16,665
That looks pretty complicated.

1494
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:19,663
I can help you.

1495
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:20,859
Super.

1496
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:23,508
Can I sleep at Dad's?

1497
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:28,223
I don't think -

1498
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:29,580
- that it's -

1499
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:31,224
- a good idea.

1500
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:55,707
The atmosphere on this planet's
like on earth.

1501
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:56,979
Kirk, over and out.

1502
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:05,501
It's really a beautiful spot, huh?

1503
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:08,022
It's just that - alone ...

1504
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:11,580
Shouldn't we give it another try?

1505
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:15,866
I think the chapter is really closed.

1506
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:19,745
Maybe for you, but for me ...

1507
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:20,905
Hey, Mom!

1508
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:23,385
How long can I stay with Dad?

1509
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:25,069
Four days.
- Super!

1510
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:27,266
Well, then.

1511
01:29:27,470 --> 01:29:29,028
Put on your cap.

1512
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:33,469
And be good.

1513
01:29:59,390 --> 01:30:01,745
Dad, can I start digging?

1514
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:04,986
What?

1515
01:30:07,190 --> 01:30:08,828
Go ahead and start.

1516
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:10,549
I'll be right there.

1517
01:30:56,110 --> 01:30:57,463
Today in Hornberg -

1518
01:30:58,390 --> 01:30:59,664
- tomorrow in Hinterholz.

1519
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:03,705
As deputy of the
village improvement committee -

1520
01:31:04,990 --> 01:31:07,458
I tell you here and now -

1521
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:11,267
- you never ever should
have sold that house.

1522
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:15,341
It needs to be said, by God.

1523
01:31:17,190 --> 01:31:17,861
Doesn't it?

1524
01:31:55,870 --> 01:31:57,144
Now wait a minute!

1525
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:58,300
Shut up.

1526
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:03,499
What's that?

1527
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:04,986
What?

1528
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:06,942
It's a bone.

1529
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:08,579
How'd it get here?

1530
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:12,989
Maybe some dog buried it, or ...

1531
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:14,908
Stop playing with that bone.

1532
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:17,501
But there are lots more.

1533
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:18,500
What?

1534
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:20,429
It can't be.

1535
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:21,382
Please ...

1536
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:22,989
What is this?

1537
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:24,785
A caveman?

1538
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:27,379
More like a cavemen excursion.

1539
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:40,468
Those aren't bones.

1540
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:43,540
That was once a Roman.
That's it!

1541
01:32:43,910 --> 01:32:46,185
Those were whole Romans.
It's a find.

1542
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:48,620
It's a historic find.

1543
01:32:48,950 --> 01:32:50,508
We're rich.

1544
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:52,499
Filthy rich.

1545
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:56,025
And it's our big secret.

1546
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:58,426
Honest Injun?

1547
01:32:58,750 --> 01:32:59,626
Right.

1548
01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:12,099
Howdy, Mr. Krcal.

1549
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:15,062
I've been here before.

1550
01:33:15,270 --> 01:33:16,498
Incognito.

1551
01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:19,100
I keep checking if anything's new.

1552
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:22,222
Now you dug after all.

1553
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:25,260
The mayor's not going to like it.

1554
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:29,864
And you already found it!

1555
01:33:31,550 --> 01:33:32,903
Sure I found it.

1556
01:33:33,670 --> 01:33:35,149
And I'm the rightful owner.

1557
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:37,466
You can tell that to Kandler
and his old fuckers.

1558
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:38,227
What?

1559
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:42,780
The find's all mine.

1560
01:33:43,230 --> 01:33:44,458
You can keep it.

1561
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:47,503
It's all yours, the old plague ditch.

1562
01:33:49,150 --> 01:33:51,869
Why are we building our house
on a plague ditch?

1563
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:56,262
Cover it up,
and we'll forget about it.

1564
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:04,023
I'm not building my house on a grave.

1565
01:34:04,270 --> 01:34:05,259
Allright!

1566
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:06,949
Then come along.

1567
01:34:31,670 --> 01:34:32,989
That's typical, brother-in-law.

1568
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:36,068
You dig your own grave,
and then it's already occupied.

1569
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:58,379
Get away!

1570
01:34:58,590 --> 01:34:59,739
Away from here!

1571
01:35:00,310 --> 01:35:01,902
Shove off!

1572
01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:15,383
Where are you going, Dad?
Take me with you.

1573
01:35:19,870 --> 01:35:21,383
Where are we going?

1574
01:35:21,830 --> 01:35:24,025
Home. To Mom.

1575
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:25,386
Here.

1576
01:35:26,710 --> 01:35:27,779
For you.

1577
01:35:37,990 --> 01:35:40,550
Kirk to Enterprise.
Come in, Enterprise.

1578
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:43,702
We're on route 4551 .
Kirk, over and out.

1579
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:06,099
I want my wife.

1580
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:08,306
Who's your wife?
- Margit Krcal.

1581
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:10,228
Miss Margit has a customer.

1582
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:13,344
How's the house?

1583
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:19,143
We've got problems
with the workers, too.

1584
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:21,388
I could go on and on about it.

1585
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:24,310
They put in three wrong tubs
for the whirlpool.

1586
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:25,700
Three!

1587
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:27,424
But who am I telling that?

1588
01:36:27,630 --> 01:36:29,621
Right. We're moving to Vienna.

1589
01:36:32,310 --> 01:36:33,299
You can't go in now.

1590
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:37,503
What's wrong?

1591
01:36:37,950 --> 01:36:39,349
Sorry, Stephan.

1592
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:41,342
What? Who's Stephan?

1593
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:43,543
That's me.

1594
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:47,262
Haven't you heard of knocking
before entering?

1595
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:48,461
You bet.

1596
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:58,902
Well, that's how it happened.

1597
01:36:59,470 --> 01:37:01,461
Afterwards it sounds funny.

1598
01:37:01,670 --> 01:37:03,501
To me, at least.

1599
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:10,385
I don't even smoke.

1600
01:37:15,390 --> 01:37:16,505
But it relaxes.

1601
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:19,229
Let's get going.

1602
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:32,062
Admit, you're pigs.

1603
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:36,303
1,6 million ready to move in.

1604
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:40,581
Do you see any floor edgings
in the hall?

1605
01:37:42,670 --> 01:37:43,819
Me neither.

1606
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:47,502
Now I can go out there
and lay them myself.

1607
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:50,741
But I don't mind, really.

1608
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:53,507
I'm starting to like it.

1609
01:37:53,710 --> 01:37:55,587
I'll take my time doing it.

1610
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:59,143
You wouldn't have
a mitring saw here?

1611
01:38:00,110 --> 01:38:03,068
Attention! Attention!
This is the police.

1612
01:38:04,990 --> 01:38:06,264
Mr. Krcal -

1613
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:08,741
- be reasonable.

1614
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:12,909
The house is surrounded.

1615
01:38:14,350 --> 01:38:16,147
Free the hostage -

1616
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:19,144
- and come out with your hands up.

1617
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:21,662
Nothing will happen to you.

1618
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:23,749
Leave your weapon inside.

1619
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:26,579
My weapon!

1620
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:31,668
TV's here, too.

1621
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:35,299
I bet they're doing reality-TV.

1622
01:38:35,950 --> 01:38:37,269
You seen it?

1623
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:39,501
I bet you have.

1624
01:38:40,590 --> 01:38:41,943
I like it -

1625
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:44,220
- because they show real things.

1626
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:48,548
An emergency helicopter action
on the freeway, if it's well done -

1627
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:51,499
- I don't need "Werewolf".

1628
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:56,701
Anyway, life's the worst horrorfilm
anyone could write up.

1629
01:38:57,110 --> 01:38:57,940
Any of them.

1630
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:01,466
Right.

1631
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:10,943
Did anyone say "fire"?

1632
01:39:11,150 --> 01:39:13,027
He might have run.

1633
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:16,699
Mr. Krcal -

1634
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:19,181
- no more amuck.

1635
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:22,940
You have 3 minutes.

1636
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:26,190
Then our 48 sharp-shooters -

1637
01:39:26,710 --> 01:39:28,780
- will open fire for 15 minutes.

1638
01:39:30,110 --> 01:39:32,021
Then we'll storm the house.

1639
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:35,626
If we haven't hit you by then -

1640
01:39:36,230 --> 01:39:40,269
- we'd be obliged if you turned
your weapon against yourself.

1641
01:39:41,110 --> 01:39:42,463
He's already outside.

1642
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:43,741
What?

1643
01:39:50,110 --> 01:39:51,543
Order cancelled!

1644
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:53,822
You're, eh -

1645
01:39:54,230 --> 01:39:55,379
- under arrest.

1646
01:39:58,310 --> 01:39:59,948
It's over. We can relax.

1647
01:40:00,150 --> 01:40:04,621
The New Years Eve hostage drama in
the prefab homes' park ended unbloody.

1648
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:08,943
A police task force
arrested the madman.

1649
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:13,268
Herbert Krcal held Gerald Isac -

1650
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:14,903
- as hostage for 4 days.

1651
01:40:15,110 --> 01:40:18,102
We're in the dark as to the
reasons for this drama.

1652
01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:23,020
Hellriegl!

1653
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:26,110
Krcal has no police record.

1654
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:29,985
I've never ever had any trouble
with the police.

1655
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:35,139
All I did was take out a building
and savings loan 5 years ago.

1656
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:37,341
Wasn't even allotted.

1657
01:40:38,150 --> 01:40:40,744
Right. I didn't even need -

1658
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:42,822
- to build a house.

1659
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:46,144
Philipp, wait!

1660
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:48,348
Let me through.

1661
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:50,782
It wasn't so bad in Vienna.

1662
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:53,021
Just the parking.

1663
01:40:54,350 --> 01:40:56,386
But I always found a slot in the end.

1664
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:12,948
Krcal to Enterprise.
Enterprise, come in.

1665
01:41:13,350 --> 01:41:14,703
Here Captain Kirk.

1666
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:17,307
Hi, Jim.

1667
01:41:17,550 --> 01:41:18,778
Krcal here.

1668
01:41:19,590 --> 01:41:21,387
It's getting a little hot down here.

1669
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:22,864
Can you beam me up?

1670
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:25,943
There's no intelligent life
on this planet anyway.

1671
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:27,626
Roger.

1672
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:29,900
Scotty, activate transporter.

1673
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:31,265
Emergency evacuation.

1674
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:36,826
Wait!

1675
01:41:37,790 --> 01:41:39,018
Take me, too.

1676
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:44,703
Energy, please.

1677
01:41:45,150 --> 01:41:46,981
Krcal, over and out.

1678
01:42:11,950 --> 01:42:13,349
Bullshit!

1679
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:20,785
- how he's going to insulate electricity
with waterproof wallpaper.

1680
01:42:22,110 --> 01:42:23,941
No, not tonight.

1681
01:42:25,710 --> 01:42:26,938
Typical.

1682
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:31,826
They build a house,
and don't have a clue, how.
