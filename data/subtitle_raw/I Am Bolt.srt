1
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,559
Man and his dreams.

2
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:06,229
<i>Since the beginning of mankind,
man has been pushing himself</i>

3
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:11,658
<i>past great limits,
beyond his wildest imagination,</i>

4
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:16,905
<i>to find himself in a place
that he never thought he'd be.</i>

5
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,827
<i>Physical strength, magnificent speed,
the human spirit.</i>

6
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:28,013
<i>The human mind
should never be underestimated.</i>

7
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,594
See, <i>some of us are born
to do great things.</i>

8
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,011
<i>To inspire.</i>

9
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,596
<i>To run.</i>

10
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,063
<i>Everyone runs for different reasons,</i>

11
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:45,403
<i>but no one in the history of humanity
has run as fast as Usain Bolt.</i>

12
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,741
<i>They get away first time,
Tyson gay right alongside Usain Bolt,</i>

13
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,320
<i>but here he goes,
streaking away already.</i>

14
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:59,536
<i>Let's take a look at the clock.
9.58. New world record!</i>

15
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,619
<i>Away cleanly.
Bolt has got a very good start indeed.</i>

16
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:07,249
<i>Look at the gap
between him and the rest of the world.</i>

17
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,167
<i>Three meters clear.
Five meters clear. And away he goes.</i>

18
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,927
<i>He continues on his way towards
another gold medal. Watch the clock.</i>

19
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:19,514
<i>19.19.
Bolt destroys his old world record.</i>

20
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,480
<i>He writes his own history
with every stride that he takes.</i>

21
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:30,321
He has defied what science or normal
people says no one is supposed to do.

22
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,702
For his height they said
he shouldn't be running so fast,

23
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,410
or for where he's from, they're
saying he shouldn't be who he is.

24
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,542
So he represent "don't let
everybody tell you you can't."

25
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,251
"Don't let anybody
tell you don't dream."

26
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,462
People love sports
throughout the world.

27
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,172
You support one football team
and you hate the other team.

28
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,093
I think with Usain,
everyone loves him everywhere.

29
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:56,223
He goes beyond boundaries
of race, religion, politics.

30
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:00,763
Usain Bolt bring rhythm
to athletics. It wasn't there before.

31
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,849
Everybody took it too serious,
maybe because they had to.

32
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:11,016
He don't have to do that.
Naturally, naturally a champion.

33
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:15,399
If you've gotten to see him
on TV, consider yourself lucky.

34
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,989
If you've gotten a chance
to see him run live,

35
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,275
consider yourself very, very blessed.

36
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,083
He's dominated.
He's won everything there is to win.

37
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,495
If he goes on
and he's three-times olympic champion,

38
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,915
I mean, no one can top that.

39
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,670
He'll never be forgotten
because no one's ever done it before,

40
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,008
and for him to just take command

41
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:42,104
and to be that much better
than everyone else is unbelievable.

42
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:51,398
He has to believe in himself
and trust god, because he born for this.

43
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,050
Yo. It's my last day in Monaco.

44
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:17,051
About to get ready
to go to China right now, Beijing.

45
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,048
Iron my shirt.

46
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,466
Once more, one more season.

47
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:31,019
They say I'm the underdog,
so let's see what happens about that.

48
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,936
Almost done ironing.

49
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,105
Oh, shit.

50
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,783
Should be a little tricky this season.

51
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:43,994
I haven't been in the best of shape,
but for me that's never an excuse.

52
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,247
I seem to always get injured
throughout the season,

53
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,790
but I always find a way
to get it right, so...

54
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:58,594
I have all faith in god and my coach
that they will get me ready,

55
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:02,425
and as long as I'm ready
when I'm on the line,

56
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,012
there's no stopping me.

57
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,017
This is the moment. Are you ready?
I keep asking myself that.

58
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,864
Been a long season.
It's been rough for me.

59
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,574
It's been tough, a few people doubting
me, saying, "you're not gonna do it",

60
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,526
or "Gatlin's running better,
Gatlin is the best right now."

61
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,199
I think this season,
because Gatlin was running so good,

62
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,208
it was playing on my mind
a little bit more.

63
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,285
<i>Commentator". Bolt,
the holder of the championship record.</i>

64
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,247
<i>The only blemish
was when he false started</i>

65
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,669
<i>in the final in Daegu four years ago.</i>

66
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:51,314
Usain is in the first semi, so we expect
him to execute and get into the finals.

67
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,654
The gun went.

68
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:59,030
And I remember the young kid
which was near me got a flying start.

69
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,662
This kind of threw me off a little bit,
so I stumbled.

70
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,486
I was like, "yo, shit."

71
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,946
He's stumbled.

72
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,326
I looked up and I panicked.

73
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,712
I need to get back in this race
as quickly as possible.

74
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,381
<i>Usain Bolt
has got an awful lot of work to do.</i>

75
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,420
<i>China is there.
Is he gonna make the top two?</i>

76
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,594
<i>He has a look,
and just, just, just does it.</i>

77
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,932
Ran through the line,
all I could think is, like,

78
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,261
"dear god, please
don't let this happen in the final."

79
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,518
Not the way he would have liked
to have done it, but he's in the final.

80
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,272
Coming back to the warm-up area,

81
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,444
I keep telling myself it's just
one start, just the one bad start.

82
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,154
You're ok. You ran back well.
That's a positive.

83
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,935
I tried to motivate myself
by telling myself these things.

84
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,319
And my coach came to me,

85
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,487
he never really says much to me,
but he called me over and says...

86
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:52,367
What the hell is going on out there?
You're trying too hard.

87
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,415
You're making the pressure get to you.

88
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,670
You need to relax, calm,
and take control of the situation.

89
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,295
You are the champion.

90
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:07,842
The race is not won at 30 meters,
at 40 meters.

91
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,719
And that, for me, really helped
when he said that.

92
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,388
It kinda released my mind,
let me relax a little bit more.

93
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:20,268
It's just a matter of you going out
there and taking charge, as a champion,

94
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,228
and give a champion performance.

95
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:29,736
I think Usain Bolt has just given us all
almost heart failure.

96
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:34,746
He'll need to step it up a gear,
because Justin Gatlin did look good.

97
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:39,001
<i>Shocking news from the American track
and field camp involving Justin Gatlin,</i>

98
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,795
<i>the doping scandal continues.</i>

99
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,090
But why are you
on top now at 33?

100
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,965
I have training partners
like Isiah Young

101
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,842
to come out and train,
who's a young star.

102
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,099
The long-term effect of steroids...

103
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,101
Do you think you can benefit from this,
even if you are clean now?

104
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,814
I think it's ridiculous.
Why are you asking these questions?

105
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,225
That happened a decade ago.
You're not a history major.

106
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,024
A lot of people
don't believe your story.

107
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,147
Are you a history major?
- I was a history major.

108
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,494
Good. Really good. Then maybe you should
go do that in a museum or something.

109
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:11,906
I think we've never seen,
probably, a closer encounter for Usain

110
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,003
than we're gonna see tonight
in this stadium.

111
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,540
Gatlin is making 9.7 and change
look easy, comfortably. Strolling.

112
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,923
I get into the warm-up area,
and I looked across at Justin Gatlin,

113
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,878
and I could see the fear in his face.

114
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:35,473
And he keeps talking to me.
He's saying "yo" and clapping my fist.

115
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:40,438
And I'm like,
why are we having a conversation?

116
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:44,152
It's proper rivalry right now.
There's no reason for us to be talking.

117
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,034
Like we are, like,
pretty much the two guys

118
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,992
who are gonna go head-to-head
right now.

119
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,281
But the fact that he kept doing that
kind of made me go,

120
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,908
hmm, you're not so confident.

121
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:06,592
With all the setbacks and
the injury concerns, it's a tall order.

122
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:12,223
Half of this crowd here
thinks he may lose tonight.

123
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,643
Gosh, I don't even wanna think about it,
i don't even wanna say it because...

124
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:20,194
I don't know. The sport will be in
a very sad place if that should happen.

125
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,521
We have two guys that's capable
of doing remarkable things.

126
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,567
And when you finally
get 'em head-to-head

127
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,031
and go run out here
in front of the world,

128
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,782
there's gonna be fireworks,
it's gonna be something special.

129
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,122
Gatlin always walk down...

130
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,376
And then Usain
would do a little bit of...

131
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,139
And depending on the crowd's reaction,
he would just...

132
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,477
He came out,
and in the back of his head he's like,

133
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,811
"oh, god, I wonder if he's ready."

134
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,147
I'm ready.

135
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,323
<i>The bird's nest is where, in 2008,</i>

136
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,664
<i>Usain Bolt was crowned sprint king.</i>

137
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:21,412
Seven <i>years on, is the same venue
about to witness his abdication?</i>

138
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,713
<i>Has Justin Gatlin
and the rest of the world</i>

139
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,419
<i>finally caught the sprint king,
Usain Bolt?</i>

140
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,590
<i>He'll start in five, Gatlin in seven.</i>

141
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:40,059
<i>American record holder
Tyson gay in six.</i>

142
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,062
Set.

143
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:50,526
Gun went. I got a good start.
I was like, "yo, this is good."

144
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,950
Just drive through your drive phases,
drive through, drive through.

145
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,530
At 30 meter I'm like, "hold on."

146
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,914
"I'm in this race."
I'm like, "yo, I'm right there."

147
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,867
Gatlin's been running all season
by himself,

148
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,668
but can you handle the pressure
when, at 50 meter,

149
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,002
there's still somebody right there?

150
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:13,918
We hit 60 meters, and me and Justin,
we start pulling away from the pack.

151
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:18,798
At 80 meters, I see him
start falling over, and I'm, like,

152
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,928
all I keep telling myself is,
"listen, do not panic."

153
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,517
Just run through the line
and time this dip because...

154
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:30,654
Because he's falling over and I'm like,
yo, just time this dip perfectly.

155
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,693
Do not dip, do not dip,
and I'm telling myself, do not dip.

156
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:38,158
I lean. I saw Gatlin,
i was like, mm-hmm.

157
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,411
<i>together here,
it's Gatlin... here comes Usain Bolt!</i>

158
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:46,664
<i>And Bolt gets this! Usain Bolt!
He's saved his title!</i>

159
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:52,594
<i>He's saved his reputation!
He may have even saved his sport!</i>

160
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,422
<i>That's the win...</i>

161
00:11:54,547 --> 00:12:00,717
<i>He's been celebrated so much more
than most others for so many reasons.</i>

162
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,555
<i>That is one of the great historic
moments in the history of sprinting.</i>

163
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,058
Everyone has a responsibility.

164
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:12,727
<i>Gatlin gets a good start.
He's already up on Zharnel Hughes.</i>

165
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,067
At this point in time, my responsibility
is make that dude run fast.

166
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,454
<i>Usain Bolt is up.
He has a lead over Gatlin.</i>

167
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,822
<i>Can the American come back?</i>

168
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,549
It's an honor to be able to come
out here and put on a great show.

169
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,790
<i>Justin Gatlin is trying
to close, but Bolt's already smiling.</i>

170
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,210
<i>Dare we ever doubt him?</i>

171
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,843
<i>The legend just grows and grows.</i>

172
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,796
What up, people? I'm here. Usain Bolt.

173
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:42,595
<i>Usain Bolt is just unstoppable.</i>

174
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:50,185
World champion four times
in the 200 meters. That's what I do.

175
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,771
Mr Bolt.

176
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:57,565
Address me right.
- Usain Bolt!

177
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:09,827
<i>Did we ever dare doubt
he would produce yet another double?</i>

178
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,547
Get things done. What ya laughing for?

179
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,510
Ah, you did well.

180
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:26,603
We can start planning.
- Me know, man.

181
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,187
It's not as fun as it used to be.

182
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,437
The older I get, the less fun it is,

183
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:44,069
because it takes up more of your time
and you have to sacrifice a lot more.

184
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,710
Normally I could just party for a while,
enjoy myself, still train hard and good,

185
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,331
but the older you get,
you can't party as much.

186
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,879
Gotta cut back on going out, drinking...

187
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,473
I gotta start eating proper, go to bed
early, stuff like that, and it's...

188
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,640
For me it's no fun and I hate doing
something that I don't really enjoy,

189
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:08,181
so I just want to get back into
the real world, you know what I mean?

190
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,926
Just hang out with some people I know,
just not train for, like, two days,

191
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,020
put my foot up, laugh, just chill,
you know what I mean?

192
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:19,856
Go to bed very late,
just to chill out and just be me

193
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,244
and just to be like a human again,
pretty much.

194
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,531
Just rollin' around in the airport.

195
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,664
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

196
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,537
Almost crashed.

197
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,794
Going home. Back to Jamaica.

198
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,837
Big up, big up, big up, big up, big up.

199
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:44,261
Mr coach mills, how are you feeling
after a long, grueling season?

200
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,095
I'm feeling great.

201
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:53,180
For the first time, he went into a meet
not being favorite to win,

202
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:58,399
and this is what makes you a champion,

203
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:03,903
not just winning
when you're favorite to win

204
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,198
but winning the ones
that you're not supposed to win.

205
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:11,373
We did a great job in establishing

206
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:17,464
that we are not just talented
and brilliant coaching,

207
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:24,883
but we have character and quality
that puts us above the rest.

208
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,346
And I know I'm gonna pay for this.

209
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,434
Team, team Bolt.

210
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,688
Alright, no, team mills. I don't know.

211
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,624
This is my passion when I'm not running.

212
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:44,209
I love to ride quad bikes. It gives you
that same adrenaline when you run.

213
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,627
The only rule is if you take an orange
tree out, you've got to pay for it.

214
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:51,387
That's the only rule they have here,
so it's just all fun.

215
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,291
Yeah, you know,
when Usain first came on the scene,

216
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:27,507
he almost threw the rulebook out,
the textbook out the window in a way.

217
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,470
But, you know, that's... sometimes you
think maybe that's what makes him great.

218
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,802
You know, he often says
he needs his time away from the track.

219
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,639
If he's always focused,
always thinking about running,

220
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,675
always thinking about how to get faster,

221
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,599
then maybe it has
a negative effect on him.

222
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,847
Ooh.
- Kill 'em!

223
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,019
Ooh.
- Kill 'em!

224
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,396
Ooh.
- Kill 'em!

225
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:49,113
Me pussy!
- Oh, gosh, boy!

226
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,032
For me, rio is the biggest thing.

227
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,409
I need to go there
and do what's never been done before,

228
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:05,379
and that's win three more gold medals
at the Olympics.

229
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,301
I like to set myself apart
from the rest,

230
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,471
and I'm setting the standard,
so anybody comes, they say,

231
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,801
"great athlete comes every ten years",

232
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,346
so if a great athlete comes
in ten years,

233
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,020
he's got a lot of work to do
to surpass me.

234
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,230
So Usain likes to have a small team
around him. I see it like a triangle.

235
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,482
At the top there's coach mills,
who's his coach,

236
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,725
who's his second father,
who's the one that makes him run fast.

237
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,108
And then he's got nj, his best friend,
they grew up together,

238
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,526
they went to school together,
he's become his manager.

239
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,575
And then on the other side
of the triangle is me and our staff.

240
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,200
I actually think nj is
the most important person in his life.

241
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,828
This is called a food samplings.

242
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:47,205
I have to sample food
and ensure that it is right for Usain.

243
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,835
So if I drop down, yeah?

244
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,302
I have to sample each food
an hour before.

245
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,679
Is it true that you sample everything
for Usain before he...?

246
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,802
No.

247
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,137
I think nj's the one
that keeps him motivated.

248
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,724
He loves him like a brother.

249
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,729
He would take the bullet for Usain
and I think he plays a huge role.

250
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,983
It's very nice of Ricky to say it,
though. I look at it as a team.

251
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,686
Our role in his life

252
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,486
is to get him in the best
physical condition to the championship,

253
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,612
and once you do that,

254
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:19,486
he's a supreme, confident, mentally
strong athlete who will take gold.

255
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,163
I'm always telling him the truth.

256
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:28,247
My... yeah? And I think that's what
we... why our relationship is good.

257
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:32,626
It has its, of course, it has its
moments, when he has to get up at six

258
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,795
and he wants his friend to say,
"ok, sleep until ten."

259
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:40,345
I'm, like, "no, gotta get up at six."
He's like, "nj!"

260
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,851
I didn't set the mark. You set it.

261
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,813
So if you said, "i didn't want to win
in Brazil", I'll leave you alone,

262
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:52,186
but once we sit and say this is
the plan, you can't change the plan.

263
00:19:56,362 --> 00:20:00,372
If you get the correct body angle,
you can simulate a start.

264
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,781
Go!

265
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,384
Alright, downhill 4.24, uphill 4.60.

266
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,921
Anything slower than that...
- Coach mills, I can't.

267
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,336
You gotta do it over.

268
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,675
I can't work like that.
- It don't register.

269
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:23,682
You know how it goes...
You got to register a time.

270
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,636
The watch stops working after 4.60.

271
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,144
Go!

272
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,990
Get a bandage. Ls it deep?

273
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:43,947
Yeah.

274
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:49,286
Bad habits. Bad practices.

275
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,087
Cut it all the time, just spike myself.

276
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:58,721
This is how you know he's getting fast.
When he's getting fast, he cuts himself.

277
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,091
Do not wipe, Eddie. Dab.

278
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,216
Ah!

279
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,314
I think if I don't cut myself,
i don't feel like I'm going fast enough.

280
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,517
I swear.

281
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,816
Battle scars. Rrrr!

282
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,154
Go!

283
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,454
It's more fluent.

284
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:28,664
Although you drive with more power,
fluency will make you go faster.

285
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,075
Makes sense.

286
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:43,803
You see, the mind, the transition
of the mind from one to the other,

287
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:48,928
sometimes it carry over,
it doesn't change out.

288
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:52,388
But since you drive pure automatic cars,
you shouldn't...

289
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,322
Coach, why you stay so...?

290
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,906
How me stay? How me stay, fat?
- We know what he's talking about.

291
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,992
L'ma try an' lose weight.

292
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,919
Turn the tables and he's gone.
You have to just allow him.

293
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,086
Set.

294
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,803
Go!

295
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,135
4.17.

296
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:37,654
That was good. Fluency, with the power
behind it, makes a big difference.

297
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:57,379
Being calm, being humble.
That's what Usain got from me.

298
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,461
The good-looking from me.

299
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:12,101
His parents were great
at instilling discipline in him.

300
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,314
Hard work. His dad...

301
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,475
He would wake up every morning, his dad
is heading out to the coffee farm,

302
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:20,265
and probably sometime go to bed
and his daddy's just coming in.

303
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,109
And discipline is key for his dad.

304
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:27,405
He did not give much trouble,
and if you said, "don't do that",

305
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,701
he'll try not to do it because he knows
a spanking will be coming.

306
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,746
I would say that he's more,
you know, mischievous

307
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,831
because he likes to, you know,
to be funny.

308
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,629
I guess it all got serious
when one sports day this guy recorded

309
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,876
that he was always beating him
in the 100 meters.

310
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:50,258
I indicated to him that if he can
beat him, lunch was on me.

311
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,767
Coach said to him,
"we give you box lunch."

312
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,890
In Jamaica that's rice and peas
and fried chicken.

313
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:02,187
Usain goes, "ok",
and he won and he got his box lunch.

314
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:08,106
He demonstrated from then
the aptitude and the discipline

315
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,118
to learning the craft.

316
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,628
Did he tell you about his dad
coming to high school to beat him?

317
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:23,753
No.

318
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:28,929
Some friend of his threw a shoe,
hit a girl. He asked him about it.

319
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,681
Of course he was being loyal,
so he didn't rat out the friend.

320
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,144
His dad heard about it.

321
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:36,773
And I didn't even ask him. At the
school, I see him going up the stairs.

322
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:37,892
You just grab him.

323
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:41,807
All I heard was "vj",
and I turn around...

324
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,609
And believe you me, I did beat him.

325
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,953
Everybody just came out
and went on the side of the hill,

326
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,780
and me and my dad was face to face,
and I fold my fists, and he saw,

327
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,118
and it pissed him off even more, and
he was, like, "yo, you wanna hit me?"

328
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,825
You have just won world juniors,

329
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:02,786
you're the most famous high-school kid
in Jamaica,

330
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:08,088
and your dad shows up at your school,
in the middle of school, and spank you.

331
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:12,505
Oh! If I was an emotional one,
i would cry.

332
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:17,016
He did say me wicked.
But now me is the best father.

333
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,641
Him talk about it and him said,

334
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,977
"daddy, I did say you wicked,
but you is the best father."

335
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,786
Big man now, eh?

336
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:44,293
I've grown taller, that's it.
- Grown.

337
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,424
I reckon, on top a' get thin, you know.

338
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,087
Stressful.

339
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,385
Me can't be bald in my 30s.
That don't look good.

340
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,183
Daddy and his bad genes.

341
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,765
Who the bad?
- Not me.

342
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,601
Your bad genes, man.
Your head done already.

343
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:07,608
One day I was supposed to go to school
for a track meet.

344
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:11,203
Dad said,
"what time you supposed to reach?"

345
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,070
Me said seven o'clock but...
Me no have to rush.

346
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:18,948
Four thirty in the mornin'!
He come wake me up.

347
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,658
Four thirty!
An' I said, "daddy, what...?"

348
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:25,919
"Get up 'n get ready
so we can get there."

349
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,963
At six o'clock, we reach the school.

350
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,838
All the man who open the gate asleep.

351
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:39,603
Bright and early. Me and the caretaker
alone there 'pen de campus.

352
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,643
Man there ever punctual, him never late.

353
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:46,898
High school he was enjoying it
and we went to a couple of competition,

354
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,692
like western championship, and he lost,

355
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:51,856
but when Usain lose,
he doesn't take it well.

356
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,905
In third form he trained
somewhat seriously, cos Usain,

357
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,581
Usain was so talented that he didn't
have to train really, really hard,

358
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:04,621
and he put in some semblance of training
and then became the man from the west.

359
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,130
I remember walking down the tunnel
and people were chanting.

360
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,799
I was hearing the chanting,
but I didn't hear it clearly.

361
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:22,308
And I listened to the crowd and the
crowd was chanting, "Bolt, Bolt, Bolt."

362
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,562
And instantly I just got nervous.

363
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,936
Bolt! Bolt! Bolt!

364
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,533
And my legs were shaking,
my hands were shaking. I was so weak.

365
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,362
I was trying to put on my spikes,
put on one foot

366
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,968
and I was trying to put on the other one
and it wouldn't go on,

367
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,674
and I looked down and I saw it was...
They were on the wrong foot,

368
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,445
and I was like,
"oh, my god, this is not good."

369
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,880
I get into the blocks.
I was so weak, I was still weak.

370
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,210
But when the gun went, and it go pow,
all that just kinda went away.

371
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,008
It was like, shh, let's go.

372
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,393
I remember coming off the corner,

373
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,931
I felt like I've just gotta push,
like that extra burst of energy,

374
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,096
and I went in front.

375
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:09,904
Back then my form was awful,
my neck was back,

376
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:14,152
I was skinny, and I was just running
for my dear life.

377
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,409
The crowd was going crazy.
Everybody was jumping, and...

378
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:23,661
I don't know why I did it, but I just
walked over and I saluted the crowd,

379
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,995
and when I did that I didn't know
they could get any louder,

380
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,252
but they got louder.

381
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:36,344
People always say, "what was your best
moment, then?" That is my best moment.

382
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:40,965
The first time I won a proper
gold medal, I mean a world gold medal,

383
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,014
and it was in front of my people.

384
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,349
That's where it all started,

385
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,975
when I took my first step
into becoming who I am today.

386
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:55,483
Coming from the rural area
and to step into Kingston, a city,

387
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,899
and perform in front of your home crowd

388
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:02,658
and to be able to hold his composure
in front of a sell-out stadium,

389
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,873
that's where it all started.

390
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,583
So I think that moment
will always be a special moment.

391
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,803
First...
Are we gonna have a sober weekend?

392
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,258
Starting now.
- I don't hear a "yes".

393
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:20,433
Yes, coach.

394
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,466
No, the "yes" is important,

395
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,769
because I think you have
a little bit of conscience left, so...

396
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,436
You'll remember that you say "yes".

397
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,112
He's a nice guy and he's a good guy,

398
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:43,907
but I don't know
that he's that easy to coach.

399
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:50,162
The odd time I have to say, "look,
I'm in charge", and we move on, so...

400
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:53,418
Remember you train twice Monday.

401
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,132
I know that, coach.
- Huh?

402
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,633
I remember.

403
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,563
What are you doing at this point?

404
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:13,102
At this point we're using
the ultrasound machine.

405
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,268
Which is that.

406
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:22,276
To send electronic magnetic waves
into deep within the ligaments

407
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,574
that have been damaged
to stimulate healing.

408
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,412
Well, that's what's happening right now.

409
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:38,998
Twisted my ankle four days ago
and it was swollen big.

410
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:42,049
I wish I had recorded it, but I didn't.

411
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,764
In Jamaica they have
something called "money pull-up".

412
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,345
When you hear a bad song,
you give the selector some money

413
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:48,721
and he starts the song over,

414
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,887
so I was coming to the end in a club
and then one of the songs play

415
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,977
and I wanted to do a "money pull-up",

416
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,146
so I was walking down the stairs,
actually,

417
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,321
and then I got to the barrier
and I was stepping over the barrier.

418
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:03,111
I stepped on the edge of the ledge
and twisted, just rolled my ankle.

419
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:10,826
Wow!

420
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,581
A masseuse trying to work on my leg...

421
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,497
While he's trying to burn my leg off
at the same time.

422
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,627
Yeah. After the pain, no gain.

423
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,593
No pain, no gain.

424
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:35,938
It's always frustrating, every
season, just to deal with injuries.

425
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:40,271
I was running good, coach was happy,
and then I twist the ankle.

426
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,819
That's just... that's frustrating.

427
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:47,163
It was like, shit,
this could be pretty bad.

428
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,580
And for a doctor to say, "could be out
for a while", then you start worrying.

429
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,752
You know what I mean? Like, "what do you
mean, I could be out for a while?"

430
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:00,292
So all you have to do right now
is stay off your feet

431
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,959
and that messes with your confidence.

432
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:09,798
Judging from what he say to me,
he doesn't sound worried.

433
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,178
That doesn't necessarily mean he's not.

434
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:17,015
Sometimes we do a good job
of hiding our inner feeling,

435
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:20,154
but he must have concern

436
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,232
because normally, at this time,

437
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,948
he would be far ahead
of what he has now.

438
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,160
Originally we didn't think it was
something serious, a sprained ankle.

439
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,622
We thought in two weeks
he's gonna be better,

440
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:36,252
but then it took three weeks, four
weeks, so we decided to come to Germany.

441
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,883
Usain. Hello.

442
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,258
Hey, man.

443
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:57,934
What's up? You alright?
- Very much interested to see.

444
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,192
Ok.

445
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,396
All that work.

446
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:14,699
It's encapsulated
the front part of the ligament. Here.

447
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:19,004
This sector here.
- Here was tender.

448
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,792
Yeah.
- On the bone.

449
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:24,666
That's the tendon. It is tendovaginitis.

450
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:28,514
So the tendon had stress
and the ligament.

451
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:31,472
And the tendon still is swollen,

452
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:36,723
and the surrounding,
where it slips, slipping in,

453
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:41,478
is swollen too, and this causes pain,

454
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,693
so we have to treat.

455
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,149
Now we have to work on the muscle.

456
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:58,409
He had to rest. Now he gets
a serious session for muscle training.

457
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,502
It's not good. Mmm.

458
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,996
The injury's bad, it's not as simple
as I thought it would be,

459
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:12,549
so now it's gonna be
work, work, work, work, work.

460
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:17,386
Pretty much that's gonna be my life,
so it's not something you wanna hear,

461
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,274
but it has to be done,
so I'm gonna get it done.

462
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,152
The doctor thinks it's gonna be
another three, four weeks

463
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,284
before he can start training again.

464
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,741
It's not something
that we want his rivals to know

465
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:35,871
because it gives them an edge if they
know he's missed two months of training.

466
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,121
There's only six months left
to the olympic games.

467
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,833
It's not an ideal situation
to be in right now.

468
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,917
I try to tell myself, don't worry.

469
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,922
You have the best coach in the world.
It will be fine.

470
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,625
But you still worry about
why this happened on the biggest year.

471
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,467
Am I gonna be ready?

472
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,393
It's gonna be hard.

473
00:34:56,511 --> 00:35:01,181
As it is,
he's faced with a gigantic task

474
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:05,228
because it will be
like starting all over again.

475
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:12,073
With such a long inactivity on
the track, you lose almost everything.

476
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,203
He has started doing pool training

477
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:18,662
and will resume
training in the gym and stuff,

478
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:22,623
but there's no substitute
to actually running on the track.

479
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,998
90. Very good. Let's go.

480
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,762
Come on, that's it.

481
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,630
Four.

482
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:42,217
Wall is right here,
it's right here, right here. Good. Turn.

483
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,482
Very good. Let's go.

484
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:48,941
I'm sure that, the champion he is,
good sense will prevail,

485
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:52,944
and that as painful as it is

486
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:57,568
and monotonous as it can be
for the next couple of months,

487
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:02,787
circumstances dictate
that it cannot be business as usual.

488
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:06,041
So what's the plan, coach?

489
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:10,714
<i>Well, the plan is, mr Bolt,
that you need to work your belly off.</i>

490
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:17,799
We got a fat athlete here
who's lying on his back,

491
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:22,926
so we're gonna reduce his meals
and increase the work.

492
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,890
<i>You're going to have to train
twice a day for the rest of the year.</i>

493
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,559
For the rest of the year, coach?

494
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,318
<i>I listened yesterday and you said</i>

495
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:38,780
<i>when the coach says it's time,
it's time to go.</i>

496
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,315
<i>No parties.</i>

497
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:45,868
<i>It's an end to this party-going,
because the coach says it's time to go.</i>

498
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,115
Well, as you see,
he's lying on his back.

499
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:53,129
An unusual position for him. So...

500
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,633
Turn the camera off!

501
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,724
He...
- Turn the camera off!

502
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,176
Turn the cam...

503
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:04,100
It's a sign that he surrenders.
- What can I say? He's the coach.

504
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,635
Have a good day, coach mills.

505
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,767
Ok.

506
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,153
12,13,14.

507
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,611
Coach mills is just a genius, man.

508
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:17,112
Like, I've been injured so much
over the years, through the seasons,

509
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,025
and he's always found a way
to get me in shape for the big moment.

510
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,196
Always. I don't know how he does it.

511
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,115
Final. Oh, good.

512
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,245
His career has been in...
As dramatic as it is,

513
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:37,804
has also been punctuated
by bouts of injury.

514
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,552
2004 was his first year
running as a professional,

515
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,425
but we spent the whole summer

516
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,722
looking for chiropractors
and doctors and physios

517
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,716
to try and fix his back
and his hamstrings.

518
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:50,939
At that point, in 2004, '05,
you know, you were kind of, like,

519
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,400
ok, is this guy ever gonna fulfil
the promise he showed as a junior?

520
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,572
I wasn't happy. I was pushing my
body too hard and I was not used to it.

521
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,362
And I used to watch mr mills
coaching the guys.

522
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:03,527
I was, like, yo,
i would love mr mills to coach me.

523
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:10,579
Well, first I did not agree
because I was saying to him,

524
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,665
because you don't want to do the
training, you are a little bit too lazy.

525
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,502
He said, "daddy, you don't know
what I am feeling",

526
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,128
and he did it on his own.

527
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,384
We didn't like it,
but of course it was the right decision.

528
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,799
The problem was his scoliosis.

529
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,058
It affected his worse hip

530
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:32,190
which affected his hamstring
and just a chain of reaction.

531
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,730
Scoliosis means the spine was straight

532
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:41,316
and the lumber part
a little to the side.

533
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,954
That was all.

534
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:47,621
That the coach saw, he said, "something
is wrong. Go to miiller-wohlfahrt."

535
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:52,712
So we set about
doing the specific exercises

536
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:58,801
to develop the strength of his lower
back and then to stabilize his hip.

537
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,800
It was a tough 2004, 2005, 2006,

538
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:11,598
and I think it was really up until 2007
that, you know, you started to say, ok,

539
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,854
he's now getting
consistently better and better,

540
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:17,227
and he lost the world championship
in 2007.

541
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,105
He came off the curve
level with Tyson gay

542
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:23,533
and he thought he should go away and win
and he couldn't,

543
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,573
he just didn't have any gears left,
and then he sat down.

544
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,698
I remember that night,
he went back and he said,

545
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:31,825
"coach, I can't do this again.
I've gotta win the next time."

546
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:37,916
Coach says, "listen to me. You're too
weak and you need to do another event

547
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,132
to get your strength up
or your speed up."

548
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,883
I was like, "alright, so where?"

549
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,415
He's like, "yo, next season
we need to run the 400 meters."

550
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,639
I'm like, "hold on, no",
cos the training's too hard.

551
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,680
He's like, "you're too slow
to run the 100 meters

552
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,389
and your start is really bad."

553
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,609
So I was like, "let's make a deal.
Give me one 100 meters try-out."

554
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:05,531
"If I run slow, I run the 400 meters.
If I run fast, I run the 100 meters."

555
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,448
Ran 10.03, and I was like, "hey, 10.03."

556
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:18,578
A lot of guys were running 10.03
at that time, so... I got my wish.

557
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,299
Set.

558
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:32,056
<i>Finally, a clean start.
Will it be a historic 100 meters?</i>

559
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,980
<i>Usain Bolt has the step.
Usain Bolt blowing away the field.</i>

560
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:43,191
<i>Usain Bolt takes the men's 100 meters!
It's a new world record! 9.71!</i>

561
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:44,856
9.71!

562
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:51,074
<i>Usain Bolt has run the fastest
100 meters in the history of humankind.</i>

563
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:56,329
<i>That is the fastest any human
has ever covered 100 meters.</i>

564
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,044
There's an old Chinese proverb
that says,

565
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:02,585
"the journey is as important
as the destination",

566
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:08,010
and I believe that
if you pay attention to the journey

567
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:12,432
and you do the right things,
you reach the right destination.

568
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,017
No matter how fast you run,

569
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,890
there is gonna be a time that
someone's gonna break those records.

570
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:24,478
However, when it comes to being
olympic champion, it's etched in stone,

571
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,947
and at no point whatsoever is
that title gonna be taken away from you,

572
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,910
so the title is there for life.

573
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,330
Hold on there. What say you call?
- You're the best roommate ever.

574
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,990
Me?

575
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:37,334
Yes, you.

576
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:42,833
I was roommates with Usain.
That guy was... was something else, man.

577
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,749
Well, on my corner, right,
you gotta have your orange juice.

578
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,588
Yeah, yeah.
- Vitamin c.

579
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,134
So go down smooth.

580
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,627
We got a water.
I can't really read Chinese...

581
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,299
Yeah, yeah.

582
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:58,018
And then we have some lacoste.
Keep my fresh, you know what I say?

583
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:01,391
Keep my fresh. One more thing.
This is my baby.

584
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,689
Alright. Let me see it.
- C'mon, baby thing.

585
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:08,284
Yo, cut out that. Cut out that.

586
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,571
Hold that.
See there? Coach, that.

587
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:16,865
Coach Glen mills. The best coach
in the world. In the world.

588
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:21,583
Coach mills was right next door,
and he'll be banging on the walls, man,

589
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:27,916
just "Usain! It's time to go to sleep.
You got the 100 meter tomorrow."

590
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:36,385
It's late, man, come on.
- Yeah, I'm putting on my shoes, coach.

591
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:40,682
I watched the 100 meter at my sister's
house, up by the road there.

592
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,268
It was nerve-racking.

593
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:47,483
Going to the bird's nest, it was
such fun. The place was beautiful.

594
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:52,357
Throughout his career,
I've never stood beside coach mills.

595
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:55,487
I don't even know where coach mills
watches the races from.

596
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,615
I always stay by myself.

597
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,452
I went to the stadium for that one.

598
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,707
Actually, I was
right behind the starting blocks.

599
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:09,002
Got to the line.
I was hyper, I was really hyper.

600
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,668
Set.

601
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,216
When the race started,

602
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,681
I was just,
"i need to get this first 50 right."

603
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:23,183
I was nervous, believe you me.
I shed tears with that race as well.

604
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,314
30 meters, I looked,
i was slightly behind,

605
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,229
then I ran to 50
and I was in line with everyone.

606
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,279
I ran the race with Usain.
I was up jumping.

607
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:39,204
<i>A fair start, asafa
Powell. Usain Bolt is also out well.</i>

608
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,115
I expected asafa to be ahead.

609
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,504
Everybody looked across,
he wasn't there,

610
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,211
so I was like, you know what,
continue running.

611
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,542
Ran to 60. Kinda checked. Ran to 70.

612
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:50,839
It went by so quick.

613
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:55,473
I got to 80 meters, I was like hold on,
where's asafa, you know what I mean?

614
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:59,141
And then I was like, "oh, shit, I'm
gonna win." I start beating my chest.

615
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,313
<i>Usain Bolt sprinting ahead,</i>

616
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:06,560
<i>winning by daylight
and setting a world record.</i>

617
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:11,566
<i>I have never seen another 100-meter
olympic champion run that easy.</i>

618
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,231
<i>He dominated the field.</i>

619
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,819
Oh, shit! Oh, my god!

620
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,700
Whoo!

621
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:23,704
Did you see that shit? Did you see that?

622
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:27,168
That's my roommate! That's my roommate!

623
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,455
People are saying, why did
i celebrate? Well, it just happened.

624
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:36,837
It just came out of me
because that's what I felt.

625
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:39,506
You're coming up to the line
and you go, "oh!"

626
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,885
"This is it. This is it.
This is what I've been working on."

627
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,178
I can't believe I've finally done it.

628
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:52,194
It's just so much work to get to
that one moment, to win that one moment.

629
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:56,316
I just remember
he literally exploded.

630
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,994
That image in Beijing
of him pounding his chest, you know,

631
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,333
as he crosses that finish line is like,
wait, can he go faster than that?

632
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:09,044
I mean, everyone could see
that he was something special. He...

633
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:12,745
A man like him is not born very often.

634
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:17,837
Yes. I just witnessed
something great, great.

635
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,835
I can't explain it what the man just do.

636
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,967
Say something for them.
- Well, I just did what I had to do.

637
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:27,885
I went out there and I executed,
and now I am olympic champion.

638
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,017
It's not like we never see it coming.

639
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,404
God damn!
- God damn!

640
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,358
The next thing is 200 meters.

641
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:38,243
I'm going through the rounds
and I'm feeling tired.

642
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:40,661
And I remember the night before,

643
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,620
my roommate, Maurice Smith,
was sitting down and he goes,

644
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,121
"yo, you're gonna break
the 200-meter world record",

645
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,204
and I go, "lt's hard, man."

646
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:53,249
We stayed up chatting till
i think it was like five in the morning.

647
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:56,456
And he's like, "yo, you can do it."

648
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,418
Yeah. Hot gym now.

649
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:05,046
Usain, you better get ready for go
after the 200 finals.

650
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:09,769
You don't know enough.
I'm gonna zoom in there.

651
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,102
Fresh, ain't I?
- Yeah.

652
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,807
Fresh.
- Fresh to death.

653
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,767
I cut his hair
before he went out

654
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:19,357
and, you know, we goofed off a lot
about him having his fresh cut

655
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,275
and, you know, he did a thing

656
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,275
where he rubbed his head like this
before the race.

657
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:27,794
I had the decathlon the next day,

658
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,750
so I stayed at the village
and watched that with the teammates.

659
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:40,092
Nesta Carter, Michael frater, asafa.

660
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,255
<i>On your marks.</i>

661
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,136
If you watch the race,
you can see,

662
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:50,313
as soon as the gun goes,
I'm like so focused.

663
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,984
Set.

664
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,453
I'm watching the clock

665
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,833
and I'm like,
"yo, I can make it, I can make it."

666
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:17,915
When I saw it, I didn't know what to do.
I was like...

667
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:24,804
I was happy, I was so happy, I was...
That's when all the joy came out.

668
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:31,099
It's one of the best things
in the world!

669
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,729
I have to join the celebration!

670
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:48,569
Look what happened to the place after
the man ran the world record on the 200.

671
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,369
Watch this.

672
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,543
Yo, they mash up the place.

673
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:01,382
We were watching the girls
and they dropped the Baton and we go...

674
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:03,094
We all looked at each other like...

675
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:07,094
Jesus. So Usain,
Usain called us together and said, "yo."

676
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:11,508
Team meeting.
Let's just get the Baton around.

677
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:15,809
And I remember, I looked him
straight in the eye and I said,

678
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:19,765
"I'm giving you
a third world record at this Olympics

679
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,017
and another gold medal,
don't worry yourself."

680
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,899
<i>And there's the gun.</i>

681
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,486
<i>Nesta Carter runs the lead-off
for Jamaica.</i>

682
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:29,702
Looking down the track and I see
Michael frater coming towards me.

683
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:32,544
Michael frater's, like, five six,

684
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,830
and he looks like six five,
he's so tall.

685
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:37,874
I'm like, he's coming so fast.

686
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,668
Should I run off or should I wait?
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

687
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:46,718
<i>Hand-off to Bolt
and he's on his way around the curve.</i>

688
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,841
<i>Look at Bolt go with
those big, long strides.</i>

689
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:53,095
Giving the Baton, I remember
screaming to him, "run, asafa!"

690
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:55,062
<i>And asafa Powell has it...</i>

691
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,942
"Go on, asafa! Go on, asafa!"

692
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:02,310
I remember, I remember that and, I mean,
i just felt, I just felt a boost,

693
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,400
and I felt strong and powerful

694
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:06,685
and went down the track
and I saw the world record.

695
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,449
<i>Asafa Powell...</i>

696
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:10,781
I was more happy for him
than even for myself,

697
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:15,116
you know, because it was his olympic
and that was his time to shine.

698
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:18,874
Asafa really started it,
breaking world records, and I said,

699
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:21,128
"i wanna do that.
I wanna be on that level."

700
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:28,089
Another reason why I'm so proud of him,
he did what I wanted to do, you know,

701
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:32,465
he went on and he did better than,
you know, I wanted to do

702
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:34,215
and, you know, I'm really proud of that.

703
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:38,096
For somebody to move from rival
instantly into your teammate

704
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,555
and then fully on your side

705
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:44,475
shows the bond of not Jamaicans
but as friends also.

706
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,700
If you're a young guy
an' you don't have the talent

707
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:57,044
or you don't want to work on the talent,
then don't do it, then.

708
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:00,081
Try and find something else.
There's tons of sports.

709
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,326
What is that thing them... curling?

710
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:10,304
See what I'm saying?
- First on the broom.

711
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,594
Yeah, curling.

712
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,309
You want to be a winner,
you have to work hard to be a winner.

713
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,391
True...
- You have to teach 'em that!

714
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:24,522
Me, I grew up in a...
- You should encourage them!

715
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,818
What did my father tell me?
- What did he tell you?

716
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,361
"Work for what you want."

717
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:31,244
Did he say,
"oh, Usain, you're a loser today"?

718
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:35,532
I wasn't, though...
I wasn't a loser, though.

719
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:38,328
But I'm saying, even then
if there's anythin' you want in life,

720
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,502
you gotta work for it.

721
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,910
That my father instilled in us.

722
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:46,958
"If you run and you lose, you have
to try harder and you lose, stop it."

723
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,876
Simple as that. You understand.

724
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:55,887
No, that fact of...
Yo, the fact of the matter.

725
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,011
Some of them developed late.
- What happens to the late bloomers?

726
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,519
Thank you, thank you.
What happens to the late bloomers?

727
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:05,443
You can't discourage late bloomers.
- The late bloomers.

728
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,863
The ones that take
a little bit more time to do...

729
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:09,902
Take time to develop, late bloomers.

730
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:13,695
Name someone who you know
that developed late. Name one person.

731
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:14,911
Who is great?
- Yeah.

732
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,450
Who is great?
- Nobody.

733
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:19,235
Yeah, man.

734
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:28,379
Getting his feet ready
to take on the world.

735
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,966
Good condition, coach mills.

736
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,429
Go.

737
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,482
It was my first day of training.

738
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:48,443
Finally I could run
with a little bit of pain. It felt good.

739
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:51,904
I was like, I'm back on the track,
that's a positive side about this.

740
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,896
So, coach, what do you think?

741
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:59,993
One good thing about the run,
he's not as fat as the coach any more.

742
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:08,582
Hey. So, I'm pretty bored.

743
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:14,919
Can't sleep. So just decided
to talk to the camera a little bit.

744
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,796
I'm gonna
show you why I'm spinning around.

745
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,595
Alright. Give me a minute.

746
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:25,852
I'm in my hotel room just going around.

747
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,806
With my coach, he's always saying,
"Usain, you should sleep."

748
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,438
"Lt's very important for you
to get your rest and stuff."

749
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:39,316
So I try my best to get my sleep,
especially this year, I've really tried.

750
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:41,528
What people
don't understand with Usain

751
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,079
is that cos he's so recognizable,

752
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:45,622
everywhere he goes,
he doesn't really do much.

753
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,866
I can go to the shopping mall,
i can go to the cinema,

754
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,536
but Usain's pretty much in-house
a lot of the day.

755
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:53,998
What else to talk about? I've no idea.

756
00:52:56,674 --> 00:53:01,224
So this is a Jamaican introduction,
introduction. Wallet!

757
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,926
No s... oh, I almost fall over.

758
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:07,557
Especially when he's travelling,
he's in his hotel room,

759
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,895
you can go stir crazy,

760
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,650
so often at one in the morning he gets
bored and, like, let me go somewhere,

761
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:16,694
and I can understand why he just can't
sit in his room all the time.

I'm just remembering that this is
gonna go out nationally to the world.

775
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:09,288
I shouldn't be singing.
I'm not a good singer, but...

776
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:13,083
Just letting you know what my life
is about when I'm bored sometimes.

779
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:38,357
it's hard to be as hungry as a person
who has never won a championship.

780
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:41,034
It's hard. No matter how people say,

781
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,283
"I'm very hungry,
i still wanna be a champion",

782
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:47,075
it's hard to be as hungry as a guy
who's never won an olympic champion.

783
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:49,661
I've been going through this for years.

784
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,497
Started out with my mom and my dad,

785
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:54,672
I wanted to clear their debts,
buy them things,

786
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:59,632
and then it was for me, to get nice
stuff, cars, clothes, all this stuff.

787
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:02,505
Then it was just to secure my future.

788
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:06,223
But now that I've done
most of that stuff,

789
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:09,215
it makes me just wanna give up,
do you know what I mean?

790
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:12,768
It worries me,
at this point in my career,

791
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:18,943
now at a big stage, that I still have
issues motivating myself now.

792
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:22,106
I remember I was sitting at home
and he called me up and he's like,

793
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:27,526
he's like, "John, I'm over this shit",
and I was like, "oh, ok."

794
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:30,908
"You know, I just wanna have
a normal life and relax."

795
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:34,206
"Now all I can think of is vacationing.
I can't think of anything else."

796
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,381
I know last year
it was the world championship,

797
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,250
I'm like, it's the world championship,

798
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:41,047
I wanna win, but it's not the Olympics,
do you know what I mean?

799
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,551
But then it gets to this season.

800
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:47,184
It's still like, I'm lazy,
do I really need to do this?

801
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,262
What do I have to prove,
do you know what I mean?

802
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:51,718
And same thing with Michael Johnson.
I asked him.

803
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,479
He said, "yo, I've done everything
in the sports, why stay?"

804
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,731
I think you get to a point,
as an athlete,

805
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,855
where it becomes
less about competing against others

806
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,404
and more about
competing against yourself.

807
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,738
It's a much more lonely pursuit.

808
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,991
I think lonely is...
It goes deeper than that.

809
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:14,408
I feel like it is, it's gut-wrenching.

810
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:17,118
You're at a place that no one else is,

811
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:22,879
and sometimes you just feel like,
you know, no one is in your shoes.

812
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,259
In terms of daily motivation
for training,

813
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,303
you've got to motivate yourself

814
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:33,847
based only on you and what you want
and how bad do you want it.

815
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:39,610
When the battle is with yourself,
you can't lie to yourself.

816
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,820
When you look in the mirror,
you know all the truth.

817
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:49,487
Battling with yourself is... is...
That's deep.

818
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:52,405
I think a lot of times you lose control
when you're at this level

819
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:55,584
because everyone's pulling you
from one direction, another direction.

820
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:58,004
I think sometimes
you want your own personal life back.

821
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,543
When you can say, "I'm waking up at this
time, I'm doing this when I wanna do it,

822
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:05,458
I'm going out here", you know, and i
think sometimes he's had enough of this.

823
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:09,429
When the time comes for you
to just enjoy yourself sometimes,

824
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:14,141
even during the season I take a weekend
and just have fun with my friends.

825
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:26,485
Just to me when we spoke, it did
sound like a guy crying out for help.

826
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,650
You know what I mean?

827
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:32,028
And he'd do anything he could
to self-sabotage what he was doing,

828
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,407
just to have an out.

829
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,873
10.95.

830
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,633
And I guess the answer
he was expecting to hear from me was,

831
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:45,251
"nah, man, you need to get ready
for the olympic games."

832
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:46,799
I was like, "bruv, quit."

833
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,125
"Will you be happier?"

834
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:54,048
And he was like... he sort of stalled
a little bit and was like,

835
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:57,349
"yeah, yeah. I just wanna relax."

836
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:06,145
Sometime after rio,
I'm gonna cut out the track and field.

837
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:09,859
Just breathe.

838
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,446
I feel like me have asthma.

839
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:19,579
Everybody knows,
even his competitors,

840
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:22,825
that he's the most talented
athlete ever,

841
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:26,548
so if he doesn't win,
it's not because of his talent.

842
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,510
It's gonna be a failure on my part,

843
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,680
Ricky's part, his family's part,
not to motivate him.

844
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,890
Close up. Close up. Close up.

845
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:39,603
Certain persons cannot handle a party.

846
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:42,015
We're trying to hold him back
and we're trying to say,

847
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,725
"come on, Usain, the Olympics
is getting closer, come on."

848
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:48,025
"Give it three months, then you can do
all these things the rest of your life."

849
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:53,990
For me, it would destroy me,
knowing that I'm a part of his team,

850
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:56,954
I wasn't able to help him
to find that motivation.

851
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:08,552
Good morning, boss man.

852
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:14,931
Hey, Ricky.

853
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:17,934
Got ya.

854
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:22,516
This is the sleep cam.
Usain Bolt's sleep cam.

855
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,142
He didn't go out last night.

856
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:29,359
This is how the world's fastest
man wakes up. Not so fast now, huh? Huh?

857
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,857
I know himself, the winner in him,

858
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:38,698
he wouldn't want to see rio come on
and he's not there,

859
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,535
so we might have to ask him
the question,

860
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,580
"do you not want to go to rio?"

861
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:47,634
And once you put that on the table,
we believe that Usain Bolt will respond.

862
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:53,261
Earlier this year I've said to you guys
that, yo, I'm having doubts, I'm not...

863
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,761
Not doubts,
I'm not having the same feeling,

864
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:58,604
like I'm not motivated, but then...

865
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,474
Are you going to win?

866
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,939
Justin, we need to hear you say...
- We need a guarantee.

867
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,400
"l'm bringing the gold medal..."
<i>- I'm going</i> to <i>win.</i>

868
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:08,691
"back to the us of a."

869
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:10,824
He just said he's gonna win.
<i>- I'm going</i> to <i>win.</i>

870
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:14,111
<i>Oh, yes!
- We bring it to la, to New York.</i>

871
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:16,446
<i>We go out on a tour
all around the country</i>

872
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,701
<i>with that ribbon around my neck
like a gold chain.</i>

873
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:20,124
That's what I'm talking about.

874
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:26,923
And as soon as I watch that video,
soon as I watch that video...

875
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,460
Everything changed.

876
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:35,257
I didn't... I'm not saying
i got back my full motivation.

877
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:40,932
I'm not saying that I was cured
or I was saved or it was a epiphany,

878
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:48,274
but I got that feeling, that feeling
in my stomach that, "yo, what?"

879
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:52,565
"He's gonna beat me? Hell, no."
You know what I mean?

880
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:56,991
The truth is I'm gonna retire soon,
so I can comfortably say this.

881
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:01,621
They don't understand that, though.

882
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:08,501
What makes me, what makes me...

883
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:17,049
Strive is the fact
that they talk all the time.

884
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:22,014
I love competition, so when you talk
and tell me what you're gonna do,

885
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,387
all it makes me wanna do
is work harder.

886
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:28,814
So... big up to yourself, Justin Gatlin.

887
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:36,690
Five thirty. Don't know why I'm up
this early. Gotta work out.

888
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:40,158
Life of a champion, right? Full marks.

889
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:08,926
Five, six. Don't bounce it.
Seven. Don't bounce it.

890
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,099
Eight, nine, ten.

891
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,726
Seven. Seven. 24. 25.

892
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,565
Good job.

893
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:18,551
Everybody knows that I'm the coach
and I have the authority.

894
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,630
I don't have to wear it on my face.

895
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,756
We joke a lot.

896
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:30,313
We try to make the whole thing exciting
because he likes fun.

897
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:35,558
Remember you said you'd do a high jump?
Where was it? In Europe or something?

898
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:40,277
Ostrava.
- Ostrava? And that was super.

899
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,400
But it's the javelin
i want to throw.

900
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:43,927
How much money you bet on it again?

901
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:46,569
I don't know how much money,
but you have to give me something.

902
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:48,738
Bolt... what we saying?
- Over a hundred dollar.

903
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,827
What did we say,
you can't throw over 50 meters?

904
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,002
50 or 60...

905
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,290
No, no, no, no.
I have to be in that bet.

906
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:56,955
You think I can't throw that?

907
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,213
50 what?

908
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:01,051
No, I'm gonna bet now.

909
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,841
I'm telling you you can't throw it...
I'm telling you.

910
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,505
How much you wanna bet?
- What?

911
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:09,894
A mill? One million?
- What?

912
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:12,853
You sure?
- Yeah, man.

913
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,024
You can't throw over 60.

914
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,262
50 to 60.
- No, no, no, no.

915
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:18,812
60. You can't change it now.
60 we say now.

916
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,568
The man dem say yo...
- No, no, no, no.

917
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,230
Not them. Me! My bet is 60.

918
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,359
They told me
i can't throw over 50 meters.

919
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,238
I told them I can go 60,
let me tell you.

920
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:30,775
You can't do 60.

921
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:32,239
You go, 37°" 9°-

922
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:36,709
we'll have a shake. You hear that?
He can't throw 60 with a javelin.

923
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:41,131
60 is my bet.
- I won't argue. Just give me my money.

924
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:44,632
Coach, listen, me seen the other
athletes stand up and throw 40.

925
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,166
Just stand and throw.

926
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:51,219
Eddie say you cannot throw 60
and Eddie teach it. Eddie's a teacher.

927
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:55,136
Me nah worried.
Listen to me, I get my three tries...

928
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,556
Three tries?
- You always get three tries.

929
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:00,265
One try.
- One try?

930
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:03,147
One try, you know.
- It can't be one throw.

931
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,404
When you ever hear
someone get one try for a bet?

932
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:09,737
In our arrangement.
- No, that's not how it works.

933
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:13,284
You must get warm-up throws.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

934
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:27,874
We don't have to have a military thing,
because if you can reach people...

935
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:33,644
You tend to get more out of them.
That's my philosophy.

936
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,433
Go!

937
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:37,387
Yeah, you look good.

938
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,765
That's not bad at all.

939
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:44,273
That was smooth!

940
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:53,778
We gonna give it to Usain, so whenever
you see him, just present one of these.

941
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:56,448
He should be able to solve it
in 30 seconds.

942
01:05:56,619 --> 01:06:01,539
Here you go, Usain, a token of
my appreciation. Here you go, mr Bolt.

943
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,626
It's called a rubik's cube.

944
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:06,961
A rubik's cube. I knew the word.
That was your first test.

945
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,798
Yeah.

946
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:13,221
Go.
- Can I have a first clue?

947
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:14,354
No, you don't.

948
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:18,891
Over, over this.
I don't have the first clue.

949
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:21,771
People, we are showing the world
a secret

950
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:26,265
as to why Usain is so cutting edge,
always ahead of the pack.

951
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,939
No.

952
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,278
Now I work.

953
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,660
You see with a matter,
if it can be done, Bolt can do it.

954
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,874
Watch how he broke stuff.

955
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:43,208
Evil. Evil.

956
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,785
But...

957
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,594
Bolt.

958
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,510
Bolt, this is your answer
to solving the problem.

959
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,506
It was a good one. It was a good idea.

960
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:59,848
You see I knew Bolt was like this,
so... I bought two.

961
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,734
Bolt, are you breathing?

962
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,186
Yeah.

963
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:17,118
I'm a type of person, I get nervous
before my first race, I really do.

964
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:21,832
Like, every year my first race I worry,
am I still fast?

965
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:29,959
I train well, I execute well in training
but I always worry, am I still fast?

966
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:33,258
Am I still the fastest man in the world?

967
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:37,933
Am I still this great Usain Bolt?
Every year. I don't know why.

968
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:41,644
So my first race right now
I'm always slightly nervous,

969
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:44,386
but after the first one
my confidence grows,

970
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:47,399
and the more I compete,
the more I get more confident.

971
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,322
We're in a foreign land.

972
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:04,289
It's the start of the season.
I came out for my first race.

973
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:07,334
I haven't raced since Beijing.

974
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:11,548
I'm just hoping that, after this first
race, I feel like, yeah, this is it.

975
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:14,881
The season has started
and I feel like I'm ready to go

976
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:17,138
and I'm heading on my way to rio.

977
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:31,824
I've been working hard.
I've had setbacks with my ankle issue.

978
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:36,531
But I'm on the right track now
and getting to where I need to be.

979
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:40,913
I'm happy that it's time now.

980
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:45,294
It's time where it's just going to be
competition. That's what really matters.

981
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:49,293
I hate the training part of it,
but I love competing so much.

982
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:51,837
Bolt!

983
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:05,137
Usain Bolt!

984
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:48,520
The start was pretty good, I think,
i think it was an excellent start,

985
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:52,563
but when I went to do my transition
and ready to push, I felt my hamstring.

986
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,819
If it wasn't for that,
i would have ran easy a 9.80.

987
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:01,914
50 meters, when I'm coming out
of my drive phase and it's time to go,

988
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:05,911
you know what I mean,
that's when I start running, I felt it.

989
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:09,365
So then I had to start looking around
to see where I'm at

990
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:14,207
because I don't want to push too hard,
you know what I mean?

991
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:19,255
And then tear something.
But I don't want to lose either, so...

992
01:10:21,092 --> 01:10:24,802
I had to make a conscious decision
to get shit right, you know what I mean?

993
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:28,059
I'm just too competitive.
I'm just really competitive.

994
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,692
I take it personally
when I lose to somebody.

995
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:35,820
I always go after that person.
I tell myself, you can't beat me again.

996
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:39,400
I don't want to lose
at any point in my life.

997
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:47,992
<i>The race we were denied last year at the
world championships, we will get tonight.</i>

998
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:52,619
<i>The world champion vs
the olympic champion. Blake vs Bolt.</i>

999
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:57,171
<i>Off they go.
Powell is off well. Bolt has work to do.</i>

1000
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,585
<i>Powell is ahead of Bolt
and the rest of the field.</i>

1001
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:04,184
<i>Asafa Powell! Blake comes forward
on the outside! Yohan Blake wins!</i>

1002
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:07,135
I know he wasn't at his best
because I train with him,

1003
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,893
so I know what he was going through.

1004
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:12,475
<i>The big man Bolt has a platform now</i>

1005
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:16,522
<i>to restate his dominance
as the world's best.</i>

1006
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:19,107
I take my 200 meters very personal,

1007
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:23,283
so for me it was a big deal that
he actually beat me over 200 meters.

1008
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,574
<i>Blake is running well in Lane three!</i>

1009
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:29,658
<i>Bolt is being beaten here by Blake
once again!</i>

1010
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:33,956
<i>And yohan Blake,
for the second time in three days,</i>

1011
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:38,801
<i>delivers a beating on the world's best,
Usain Bolt.</i>

1012
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:41,955
<i>What counts will be London,
but Blake has to be thrilled</i>

1013
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:46,139
<i>with his performances
at the nationals this weekend.</i>

1014
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:49,310
For the next month
the work that I put in

1015
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:56,350
to make sure I could silence all
these doubters was just unbelievable.

1016
01:11:56,479 --> 01:12:02,069
I vomited daily because I was
pushing myself to the ultimate level.

1017
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,956
Being great
isn't good enough sometimes.

1018
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:27,468
You have to be better than great
and failure is just not an option.

1019
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:33,063
At some point, and under those sort
of circumstances, you're just racing.

1020
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,392
You're just racing like we did
when we were kids,

1021
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:38,398
just, "i am not gonna allow you
to beat me today."

1022
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:46,146
Everybody who was anybody in that race
was on my left,

1023
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:47,699
so I didn't have to look right.

1024
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:51,992
I was, like, you know what, everybody's
on one side of me. This is great.

1025
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:55,868
On your marks. One deep breath.

1026
01:12:56,539 --> 01:13:00,249
<i>The moment of truth
has finally arrived.</i>

1027
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:04,964
<i>The fastest group of
sprinters that has ever taken the line</i>

1028
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:06,379
<i>in a 100-meter olympic final.</i>

1029
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:10,967
<i>God put me on this earth to run,
and that's what I'm gonna do.</i>

1030
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,140
<i>Bolt not very quickly out of the blocks,
Powell was the quickest,</i>

1031
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:19,688
<i>but Bolt just coming into his stride
alongside Gatlin.</i>

1032
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:23,686
I saw Usain in the peripheral vision.
"Damn, he's coming. He's coming fast."

1033
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:27,896
When I seen those strides
coming through, bam, bam, bam, hitting,

1034
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,530
I said, "oh, god."

1035
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:31,905
In that split second he just fly past.

1036
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:36,908
<i>And here comes
Usain Bolt, he's pulling away. 9.64!</i>

1037
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,539
<i>The champion becomes a legend.</i>

1038
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:45,919
<i>Why did we ever doubt
the brilliance of Usain Bolt?</i>

1039
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:48,797
Beijing was, you know, off the planet,

1040
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:53,595
but actually it was London, I think,
that established him for all time.

1041
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:59,271
I don't think I can remember anybody
since Muhammad Ali

1042
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:05,903
that has just grabbed the stage
in any sport in the way Usain has.

1043
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:15,120
So, on the day, 100 is for
my coach, that's how we do it,

1044
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,952
100 meters for my coach,
the 200 is for me,

1045
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:22,119
so he didn't say absolutely nothing
to me when it comes to the 200 meters.

1046
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,289
He was like, "go get 'em, champ."

1047
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,724
Came out. I know I had more energy

1048
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:34,891
because I had more confidence,
so everything was smoother, I was happy.

1049
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:42,191
I remember doing some stride out
and Warren Weir was in front of me,

1050
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,731
and I said to Warren,
"I'm gonna run past you pretty fast."

1051
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:51,146
"Do not try to run me down. You run
your own race and you'll be fine."

1052
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:56,531
Shh.
- On <i>your</i> marks.

1053
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,579
Everyone was like, "yo,
are you ready? Feel like you're ready?"

1054
01:14:59,704 --> 01:15:01,834
I'm, like, yo,
I'm so ready for these finals.

1055
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:10,762
I remember coming off the corner.
I looked. I could see him.

1056
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:15,141
I was, like, "Usain, you cannot let
Blake come off this corner before you."

1057
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:17,601
It was like I found another gear
cos I started digging.

1058
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,479
When I got to the finish line,

1059
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:25,561
I remember Blake doing something
at the national trials,

1060
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:28,018
he went like this after the race,

1061
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:31,689
and when I was going through the line, i
went like this and I was looking at him.

1062
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:34,359
L was letting him know that,
listen, I'm still number one.

1063
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:38,278
You're my teammate, and I respect you,
but I'm the greatest.

1064
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,160
You know, I was a bit naive.
I was young.

1065
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:44,747
It was a bit of, you know,
rivalry between me and Bolt.

1066
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:47,544
We tried to play that down
and just go on the track and have fun

1067
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:51,298
and, you know,
he was just the better man on the day.

1068
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:55,342
And then we found out
that Warren actually came third.

1069
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,715
And then it was like
an even bigger celebration now

1070
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:03,849
because it was one, two, three.

1071
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,436
It was a great feat for my coach,

1072
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,771
and Jamaica was going ecstatic
because of one, two, three.

1073
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:10,148
You should have heard them.

1074
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,423
<i>You've got Tyson gay
versus yohan Blake</i>

1075
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,790
<i>and Blake's winning this one.</i>

1076
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:29,747
<i>Here comes Usain Bolt,</i>

1077
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:32,207
<i>and Usain Bolt is moving away.</i>

1078
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:34,718
<i>36.85!</i>

1079
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:39,100
<i>World record
for Usain Bolt and Jamaica.</i>

1080
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:51,316
So there's two screens. One here,
and there's one across the road.

1081
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:59,569
I'm gonna try experience it myself.
- Always epic.

1082
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,117
I can just imagine the energy.

1083
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:05,124
Just seeing that, full stop.
- Loud.

1084
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:08,117
Everybody just stop in one place.
Would be nice.

1085
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:16,125
Usain Bolt has represented Jamaica
in a modern era.

1086
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:20,258
In a time when there was nobody
bearing the banner of Jamaica

1087
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:25,426
and carrying Jamaica on them shoulder,
and he did all up.

1088
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:33,607
When you see him live and what he do,
and what he does on the spare time,

1089
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:36,862
definitely the new generation
of Jamaica, you know,

1090
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:40,866
so you can still be yourself
and achieve what you need to achieve

1091
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:43,490
without losing who you are,
without losing your identity.

1092
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:45,787
That's what I respect most about Usain.

1093
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:48,161
Him keep it real, you know,
as them sayin'.

1094
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:56,709
I think Bolt is a shining example
of the best that we can be as Jamaicans.

1095
01:17:56,839 --> 01:18:00,719
Out of the belly of rural Jamaica

1096
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:06,393
to becoming a face recognized
in any corner of the world.

1097
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,055
It's absolutely a phenomenal feat.

1098
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,688
Yo! Yo, yo. Yo, yo!

1099
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:18,992
A Jamaican hero
and always our hero.

1100
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:21,741
He's well beloved by everybody
all over the world,

1101
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,784
especially Jamaica,
cos we are proud of him.

1102
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:51,769
So we're now start of July.
It's the olympic trials for Jamaica.

1103
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,404
Every athlete has to qualify here,

1104
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,650
so normally it's top two, top three
gets selected on the team.

1105
01:18:57,775 --> 01:19:00,605
Two weeks ago
we had a racers track club meet.

1106
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,856
Usain won the 100 meters there
and he looked very comfortable.

1107
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,659
He's down at the line
and still had 9.88.

1108
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:07,793
<i>Bolt made that look pretty easy.</i>

1109
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:11,660
<i>In Lane four, asafa Powell.</i>

1110
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:16,921
<i>Yohan Blake.</i>

1111
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:23,928
<i>Usain Bolt.</i>

1112
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:26,141
The season's gone pretty well
for Usain.

1113
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:28,102
He hasn't ran really fast yet,

1114
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:31,142
but you would say if he ran full out
and that the race went well,

1115
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:34,097
he could run 9.70 right now.

1116
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:35,768
But, of course, he has to do it.

1117
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,106
Set.

1118
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:44,508
Yesterday they get us all up,
we had to get us all up,

1119
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:49,221
and they send us out there and,
as professionals, I'm not used to that.

1120
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:53,595
The first race was at seven
and I was in the last heat,

1121
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:56,524
and I was out there just watching
the races, you know what I mean,

1122
01:20:56,643 --> 01:21:01,363
trying to stay warm,
and then my race false started.

1123
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:08,778
And when I actually ran the race,

1124
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:12,736
I felt my hamstring like
in the Cayman Islands, I had that issue,

1125
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:17,248
and I feel it was the fact that we were
out there so long and I got cold and...

1126
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:20,133
So it was just...
I was just annoyed and frustrated

1127
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:25,670
about the whole organization
of the meet and the trial,

1128
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:28,298
so I'm not happy and I complain.

1129
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:34,394
I'm used to being sent out
at a timely fashion.

1130
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:45,938
How was your semi today?
- It's not so bad.

1131
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:48,148
I think it's easily a ten.
- Ten-one?

1132
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:49,778
The guys were going for under nines?

1133
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:53,735
I've not... listen, I'm not pulling past
anybody. We'll see what they do.

1134
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:59,750
So the good thing about Usain

1135
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:05,173
is he likes to give me a couple
of watches to take away each time.

1136
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:07,045
This one I think I'll have this time.

1137
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:10,682
Lies.
- Thank you, sir. Looks good on me.

1138
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:17,060
Yep, someone leaves them in hotel rooms
every now and again.

1139
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:18,812
Was one, bruv, one.

1140
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,774
Jesus, man, one watch.
- Yup.

1141
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:32,275
Usain Bolt!

1142
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:40,407
<i>In Lane number one,
his time 10.15 seconds as well...</i>

1143
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:32,967
Coach. It's 50/50, you know.
- You feel it again?

1144
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:36,391
Yeah, but this time
I'm trying not to push as hard.

1145
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:39,602
It don't make sense to push it.

1146
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:42,273
I'm over by the warm-up area.

1147
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:43,852
But...

1148
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:47,395
I need you to...

1149
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:53,073
I need to get a waiver, because
Usain can't run cos of this hamstring.

1150
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:59,164
What the plan, coach?

1151
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:06,922
Me call Dr. Bruce,
tell him to come over. Relax.

1152
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:39,450
Last night, him aggravate it,

1153
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:44,325
so I'm concerned it's getting...
It's deteriorating, so...

1154
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:50,040
I wanna pull him from the final,
from the race.

1155
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:04,765
So, according to the rules, you have
to report it to the medical team.

1156
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:15,322
Unfortunately, Usain had to pull out

1157
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:17,244
of the final of the 100 meters
in the trials,

1158
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:20,492
so we got it checked out
by the chief medical officer

1159
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:22,736
and it was detennined
that he had a strain in there

1160
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:24,788
and it would be dangerous
for him to run,

1161
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:26,871
so we've submitted
a medical exemption form.

1162
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:30,627
You know, we're hoping that
he can be selected based on that.

1163
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:32,841
He definitely was disappointed.

1164
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:36,051
He was quiet last night.
It's frustrating for him.

1165
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:39,223
Injuries have been the thing
that held him back his whole career.

1166
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:43,139
I would say injuries have been
his biggest rival throughout his career,

1167
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:46,183
so for it to come at this time
isn't ideal,

1168
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:48,438
but I think he knows
how to deal with it.

1169
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,770
Hopefully today or tomorrow

1170
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:52,145
he's a little bit more positive
about the situation,

1171
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:54,652
but until we go
to Dr. miiller-wohlfahrt in Germany

1172
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:58,445
and he, you know, does a scan and a full
assessment, we'll not know for sure.

1173
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:17,962
What pissed me off, they were saying,
"Usain always does this."

1174
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,680
I'm like, do what?

1175
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:23,971
I beat these guys day in, day out,
every day of the week,

1176
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:29,426
so for them to say, talk like,
oh, I'm chickening out from a race,

1177
01:26:29,559 --> 01:26:32,099
you know what I mean, it's insulting.

1178
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:35,689
I've never really disrespected 'em
like that.

1179
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:37,566
Always Justin Gatlin,
you know what I mean?

1180
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,903
I've beaten him many times. He's nobody.

1181
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:43,568
I've never said these things
cos I give every athlete a respect,

1182
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:46,119
and especially the little one,
even Rodgers.

1183
01:26:46,243 --> 01:26:48,833
Get an individual gold medal,
that's what I'm thinking,

1184
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:51,714
before you even have a conversation
about my name.

1185
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:55,963
You have never won an individual gold
medal or a silver medal or any medal,

1186
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:59,206
you know what I mean, and you're gonna
have a conversation about me?

1187
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,510
I've built this sport,
you know what I mean?

1188
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:05,854
You guys have been through so many drugs
charges and so many drugs things,

1189
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:09,601
I've never pointed the finger and say,
"these guys are making the sports bad."

1190
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:12,555
If you cross the line,
I'm gonna cross the line too,

1191
01:27:12,686 --> 01:27:15,226
because I think I'm one of
the nicest guys on the circuit.

1192
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:18,065
I've always shown people respect,
so it pisses me off.

1193
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:24,074
Last season was one of
the most horrifying seasons of my life,

1194
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:28,787
and getting to Beijing, I wasn't
in the shape that I wanted to be.

1195
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:31,662
So going into that race,
it was pretty much a dog fight,

1196
01:27:31,788 --> 01:27:35,038
it's like I'm out there just
for my life, you know what I mean?

1197
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:39,377
We're going in the biggest race of your
life right now to defend your glory,

1198
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:43,224
cos being undefeated in the championship
is everything for me.

1199
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:46,551
That's my legacy that I have
and I have to defend.

1200
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:49,218
So this season is not gonna be
like last season,

1201
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:51,637
not gonna be one of those races
where everybody's like,

1202
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:53,937
"oh, my god, is Usain Bolt gonna win?"

1203
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:57,440
And this year I'm a little bit more
angry also, you know what I mean?

1204
01:27:57,564 --> 01:28:00,784
I'm a little bit more ticked off about
things these guys have been saying,

1205
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:04,031
so it's not gonna be the same.

1206
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:06,244
I'm gonna...

1207
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:09,453
It's not gonna be the same.

1208
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:21,004
I don't think we'll ever see
anyone, certainly not in my lifetime,

1209
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,259
who'll be able to win
three olympic games

1210
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:25,681
in the 100 meters, 200 meters
and the four by one.

1211
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:29,261
I think it will be one of the greatest
achievements in the history of sport.

1212
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,360
When you think of Usain Bolt,
you're definitely gonna have to think of

1213
01:28:43,485 --> 01:28:47,605
the Muhammad alis, the pelé,
the Michael Jordans.

1214
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:51,199
Like, amazing athletes
that's reached beyond

1215
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:53,656
what any other athlete has reached,

1216
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:55,957
Serena williamses,
it's just those names,

1217
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:58,041
Usain Bolt goes right in there.

1218
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,466
He is one of my idols.

1219
01:29:13,557 --> 01:29:17,687
I hope he doesn't run
against a Brazilian in rio.

1220
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:20,521
Then I'm going to suffer.

1221
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:26,608
It will
be hard not to support Usain Bolt.

1222
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:32,116
There will be a lot of Brazilians
supporting him. He is an icon, an idol.

1223
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:39,290
Getting to the championship,
it's distraction, it's injuries,

1224
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:42,746
but for whatever reason,
when he gets to the championship,

1225
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:44,918
he's just a different animal.

1226
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:50,304
Usain, two days out
from the hundred, how are you feeling?

1227
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:04,398
Will you give us a photograph?

1228
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:08,901
The moment
we've all been waiting for now.

1229
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,070
Please welcome the main man. Usain Bolt.

1230
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:20,793
It's not been the perfect build-up,
has it?

1231
01:30:20,916 --> 01:30:22,626
How worried should people be?

1232
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:24,461
Are you afraid of losing?

1233
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:27,706
How ready are you
to defend your titles?

1234
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:34,097
How sure are you that the sprint
races that you'll be involved in

1235
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:36,430
will be free of drugs?

1236
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:38,346
How does athletics,

1237
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:41,385
even the olympic movement,
survive without Usain Bolt?

1238
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:43,769
What does that make you feel?

1239
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:46,227
These your last games?
How does it feel?

1240
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:50,738
Is that sad to think about? Ls it
emotional? Or are you just excited?

1241
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:59,575
How do you deal with this pressure
to always be the best,

1242
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:01,624
to always be the fastest?

1243
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:05,964
If you wanna be obsessed,
be obsessed about after the gun,

1244
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:08,667
what technical...

1245
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:14,299
What kind of questions
are you tired of getting asked?

1246
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:18,887
I don't know. I think I've been asked
so much questions, it's hard to say.

1247
01:31:19,015 --> 01:31:21,265
I think it's just
when it's mostly after...

1248
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:23,143
Sorry, sorry.
- In the light.

1249
01:31:25,939 --> 01:31:28,479
He always stays in the athletes' village
with the team.

1250
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:31,608
He loves the team environment.
That gives him energy.

1251
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:35,196
He doesn't need a lot.
It's a spartan existence.

1252
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:38,953
He just needs to sleep, train, eat
and prepare for the race.

1253
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:45,883
He gets this dormant quietness
about him.

1254
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:51,211
I think he's going through everything
in his head.

1255
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:54,799
All the vulnerabilities, insecurities,
game plans, race plans.

1256
01:31:56,302 --> 01:31:59,812
And then he gives us
the bravado, the smile.

1257
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:03,271
The pose. The rest is history.

1258
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:10,856
Show people.

1259
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:12,194
Lots of grey hair, man.

1260
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:15,858
Look right here, people. See?

1261
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:17,489
Your head bald, man.

1262
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:25,922
Hey, don't take off the moustache.
Just leave...

1263
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:28,501
Take off everything, kettle,
and just leave a moustache.

1264
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:30,916
Don't worry about that.
- You can look for yourself.

1265
01:32:31,046 --> 01:32:32,916
I'd look like a police.

1266
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:38,724
We have danced...

1267
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:44,348
Tomorrow, aerodynamic.
Yeah, let's dance, the people.

1268
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:46,686
Oh, yeah, freshness.

1269
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:48,311
Off to the block.

1270
01:32:50,899 --> 01:32:52,979
Yo. Almost did.

1271
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:59,321
I was there, I was there,
i was there. I was there.

1272
01:32:59,449 --> 01:33:01,829
Honestly, I was there. I was there.

1273
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:04,581
Yo, that's the 'o8... yo, yo...

1274
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:09,004
Yo, that's the 2008 edition. Ali!

1275
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:17,968
So I'm about to go to bed.
Got my fresh cut today.

1276
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:20,763
First round is tomorrow.
I'm looking forward to it.

1277
01:33:20,887 --> 01:33:23,717
Am I nervous? Just a little bit.

1278
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:26,518
But the more I run,
the more I feel better.

1279
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:32,862
Watch out. There's gonna be fire.

1280
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:35,573
Peace.

1281
01:35:02,906 --> 01:35:10,906
<i>From Jamaica, reigning olympic
world champion, Usain Bolt.</i>

1282
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:20,509
Came off of the semi-finals,
i felt great.

1283
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:23,512
In warming up I felt quick,
felt light on my feet.

1284
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:27,349
Oh! Fisher.

1285
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:35,103
Fisher.

1286
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:38,860
<i>Usain Bolt knows
what it's like to be disqualified.</i>

1287
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:44,776
<i>Bolt. Ls this
going to be the biggest challenge...</i>

1288
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:47,736
I came out here and I got a flyer,

1289
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:51,407
I got the best start
I've ever gotten in a long while,

1290
01:35:51,537 --> 01:35:56,497
and I ran to about 40 meters,
and when I came out of my drive phase,

1291
01:35:56,626 --> 01:35:59,456
I was alongside everybody
and pulling away.

1292
01:36:01,297 --> 01:36:03,967
Perfect picture, you know what I mean?
Bright smile.

1293
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:08,932
It looked like I was actually looking
into the camera and, like, smiling.

1294
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:10,595
There was something in that smile.

1295
01:36:12,725 --> 01:36:15,475
Oh, shit.

1296
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:42,546
<i>This guy is without doubt</i>

1297
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:45,802
<i>the greatest sprinter
the world has ever seen.</i>

1298
01:36:45,925 --> 01:36:52,305
<i>We know this is going to be his last
appearance at an olympic games.</i>

1299
01:36:54,309 --> 01:36:58,809
<i>And surely a hat-trick of golds
over the 100 meters</i>

1300
01:36:58,938 --> 01:37:04,188
<i>would be a feat never to be repeated,
certainly not in lifetimes.</i>

1301
01:37:25,298 --> 01:37:26,968
Set.

1302
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:49,490
I was born to be an athlete.

1303
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:52,744
I think it was just my moment
and I was always gonna do great.

1304
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:56,497
I want to be remembered
among the great athletes in the world.

1305
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:58,001
I want people to talk about me

1306
01:37:58,122 --> 01:38:02,792
when they talk about Muhammad Ali
and pele and all these guys.

1307
01:38:09,634 --> 01:38:12,184
<i>He's immortal now.</i>

1308
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:17,393
<i>All the way from Beijing to London
and now to rio.</i>

1309
01:38:18,434 --> 01:38:23,314
<i>It is one of the greatest
athletic achievements of all time.</i>

1310
01:38:25,525 --> 01:38:27,275
When Usain Bolt win the race,

1311
01:38:27,402 --> 01:38:30,282
the whole world feel like
they win a race.

1312
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:32,445
That I can't explain.

1313
01:38:33,699 --> 01:38:36,039
Number one on there today.
Remember that.

1314
01:38:37,036 --> 01:38:41,956
Yo, when you wake up
and you feel like a million dollars

1315
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:47,553
and you remember that you're olympic
three-time 100-meter champion,

1316
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:49,172
it's a good feeling.

1317
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:52,087
Two more to go, baby. Yeah!

1318
01:38:53,553 --> 01:38:56,313
You're from other countries
and you're rooting for your country,

1319
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:59,231
but then you see Bolt and you're like,
"ok, I'm rooting for Bolt."

1320
01:39:00,726 --> 01:39:02,976
Everyone wanted to see Bolt run,

1321
01:39:03,104 --> 01:39:06,484
and that's something that, you know,
just doesn't happen.

1322
01:39:06,649 --> 01:39:08,439
No one knows what nine-five feels like,

1323
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:10,699
no one knows what it is to run
in the olympic games,

1324
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:12,990
but for some reason
when he steps on the line,

1325
01:39:13,114 --> 01:39:15,624
you feel like you're running with him.

1326
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:22,671
I have no doubt
that you'll have a faster runner

1327
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:24,460
than Usain Bolt in the future,

1328
01:39:24,584 --> 01:39:28,254
but the world
will always remember Usain Bolt.

1329
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:38,350
The last three Olympics
have been amazing with Usain,

1330
01:39:38,473 --> 01:39:42,103
um... and he really went out in style,
you know.

1331
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:45,396
He's the best athlete
who's ever lived by far

1332
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:47,111
and he proved that again tonight.

1333
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:54,163
A youth who was born relatively poor,
in terms of economics,

1334
01:39:54,280 --> 01:40:00,870
but was rich, was rich with talent,
rich with life, rich with substance.

1335
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:05,495
And to see somebody like that
rise to win an olympic gold medal,

1336
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:08,666
like, that's what the world needed.

1337
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:16,635
I found the drive and I was relentless
in wanting to become the greatest.

1338
01:40:16,761 --> 01:40:18,511
So for me it's like...

1339
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:22,516
I found it, I did it.

1340
01:40:22,642 --> 01:40:27,102
It took a lot of hard work and guts
and focus and concentration.

1341
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:31,983
It's not easy.
People feel like it's simple.

1342
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:35,909
And I have to remind myself that,
listen, you have a goal for yourself,

1343
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:40,870
and if you don't win this year, all that
you've done doesn't really matter,

1344
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:43,413
and that's one of the things
that kept me going.

1345
01:40:43,538 --> 01:40:46,248
<i>Running in Lane four, it's Jamaica.</i>

1346
01:40:46,374 --> 01:40:50,554
Big up to Usain.
Definitely he is a legend.

1347
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:54,380
It's a great feeling being, you know,
his friend and his teammate.

1348
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,300
And we did it for him,
tonight was for him.

1349
01:40:58,427 --> 01:41:01,307
I think they should just give him
the stadium, take it back to Jamaica,

1350
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:02,930
take it wherever he wants, you know?

1351
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:04,427
What is there still to give him?

1352
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,940
To come and do something
like that, getting nine gold medals,

1353
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:10,613
that has been magical.

1354
01:41:12,149 --> 01:41:15,359
He's up there with the big guys.
He's sitting at the table.

1355
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:29,957
It is a dream of every coach
to have a talented athlete,

1356
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:35,554
and to have one as talented as Bolt
is extra special.

1357
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:41,598
To see this child I grew up with,

1358
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:47,981
this boy influencing the world
the way he has, is special.

1359
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,860
It gives you a sense of purpose.

1360
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:53,820
Like you have contributed
to something great.

1361
01:41:55,943 --> 01:42:01,203
Cos he ain't here trying to be
political or revolutionary.

1362
01:42:01,324 --> 01:42:05,164
His whole quest
is to just make people smile.

1363
01:42:05,286 --> 01:42:08,076
Probably that's why
the world responds to him so much.

1364
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:11,955
At a time when the world is in chaos,
he's just all about smiling.

1365
01:42:12,084 --> 01:42:15,804
For nine seconds,
let's just put the runner euphorically.

1366
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:20,925
I've dedicated all my life
to being the best,

1367
01:42:21,052 --> 01:42:24,262
and to being the best track and field
person I can possibly be,

1368
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:26,388
trying to be a legend,
trying to be the greatest,

1369
01:42:26,515 --> 01:42:29,435
trying to be unstoppable,
trying to be undefeated.

1370
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,400
I've dedicated my life to this.

1371
01:42:31,937 --> 01:42:36,227
If I was an emotional guy,
right now I'd be crying for sure,

1372
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:38,359
because it's been such a long journey,

1373
01:42:38,486 --> 01:42:43,116
and now, for me,
it's like... it's finally over.

1374
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:47,080
I'm sad,
but I'm relieved that it's over.

1375
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:51,043
I've done it. I've done
what I've set out to do in the sport.

1376
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:55,335
I'm just happy this part of...
This chapter is closed

1377
01:42:55,461 --> 01:42:58,921
and I can just relax
and just go on vacation,

1378
01:42:59,048 --> 01:43:03,178
not worrying about anything,
eat some junk food and just live.

1379
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,720
Yo.

1380
01:43:06,889 --> 01:43:08,929
The greatest, the greatest.

1381
01:43:14,730 --> 01:43:17,360
I am the greatest. Remember that. I am.

1382
01:43:23,406 --> 01:43:25,946
Listen... so we had a bet.

1383
01:43:27,284 --> 01:43:31,254
Everybody's been talking
all kind of crap all season.

1384
01:43:31,372 --> 01:43:36,502
All stuff about I can't throw 60 meters.
Well, it's gonna go down right now.

1385
01:43:38,379 --> 01:43:40,339
Yo, where's the tape?

1386
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:43,384
No chance, no chance.

1387
01:43:48,097 --> 01:43:53,097
Can you believe that the last event
I'm gonna be doing at the Olympics

1388
01:43:53,227 --> 01:43:55,897
is javelin?

1389
01:43:56,021 --> 01:44:00,861
No one knew. It's a beautiful moment.
Let's do this.

1390
01:44:03,529 --> 01:44:10,619
Bolt, Bolt, Bolt, Bolt, Bolt, Bolt,
Bolt, Bolt, Bolt...

1391
