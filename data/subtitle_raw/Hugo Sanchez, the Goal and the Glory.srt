00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:36,704
<i>Football</i>

2
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,415
<i>has been the greatest</i>

3
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:41,959
<i>and strongest force
that I've had</i>

4
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,420
<i>in my life.</i>

5
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,798
<i>It was clear to me as a child</i>

6
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,425
<i>what I wanted to do.</i>

7
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,719
<i>One of the best
football players in the world.</i>

8
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,596
<i>Hugo Sanchez</i>

9
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,684
<i>has been the best
Mexican football player of all time.</i>

10
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:02,021
{\an8}The way he played,
the way he scored

11
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,774
<i>was truly incredible.</i>

12
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,984
<i>Hugo Sanchez is an idol.</i>

13
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,904
<i>Hugo Sanchez is a character</i>

14
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:14,158
<i>tied to the Mexicans' culture
and idiosyncrasy.</i>

15
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,286
{\an8}There is no 20th century,

16
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,832
{\an8}nor a history of Mexico,
without Hugo Sanchez' presence.

17
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,876
An average of 27 goals per year.

18
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,420
{\an8}Ten consecutive years
in Spanish football.

19
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:28,422
Nobody does that!

20
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:30,800
<i>Hugo Sanchez is the eminence.</i>

21
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:33,302
<i>The Miguel Hidalgo
of Mexican football is Hugo Sanchez.</i>

22
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,472
{\an8}<i>It was extraordinary
that his left leg</i>

23
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,892
{\an8}was sensational in terms
of getting the goal.

24
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,354
The best player I've ever had,
and for Spain too.

25
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:52,655
HUGO SÁNCHEZ
GOAL AND GLORY

26
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,190
<i>I started in Pumas' basic forces</i>

27
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:30,317
<i>since I was 11,
because my brothers were</i>

28
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:31,777
<i>part of Pumas' basic forces.</i>

29
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,988
{\an8}So they were
in the special reserve,

30
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,489
{\an8}which was the name
of the second team

31
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,074
{\an8}of the professional team.

32
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,743
<i>I started in the fourth children's,</i>

33
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,453
then the third,

34
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,998
then the first,
and that's when I leaped

35
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,000
<i>to the special youth.</i>

36
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,751
<i>They praised him at school</i>

37
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,545
<i>because he always got good grades.</i>

38
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,923
{\an8}All his friends liked football too.

39
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,341
{\an8}They played at school.

40
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,886
We went where Hugo lived.

41
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,430
{\an8}It was a closed street,
the typical

42
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,141
{\an8}coladerita,
because there were two sewers

43
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,102
along the street.

44
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,396
So this friend came out,
and that one.

45
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,065
"Let's play",
and we played on the street.

46
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:11,817
{\an8}In Jardin Balbuena,

47
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,194
{\an8}Place 18,

48
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,947
{\an8}with his mom,
with the family I know.

49
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,701
They had a trampoline,
his sister was a gymnast.

50
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,078
And he jumped and he jumped.

51
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,999
And everyday Hugo boom and boom!

52
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:30,127
<i>Then he arrived to the court
in CU and he finished his training</i>

53
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:34,048
<i>and one, fifty cross, and I shot.</i>

54
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,051
<i>Chucho Ramirez was on
the other side, 50 cross and shot.</i>

55
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:40,095
Training very day,
longing every day,

56
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,639
wishing every day,

57
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,016
leads you to a constant.

58
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,727
And it ends up happening,

59
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,063
because this is not about luck.

60
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,777
<i>Hugo Sanchez is exceptional
in that he became</i>

61
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,698
{\an8}in the man of the instant
and the definitive decision.

62
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,911
<i>Many of his goals took one hit.</i>

63
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:08,791
<i>He has a chance
and turns it into a result.</i>

64
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,503
<i>What mattered to me
was to triumph in football.</i>

65
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,047
<i>What mattered to me
was to be successful.</i>

66
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,591
What mattered to me
was to reach my goal,

67
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,927
my objectives and I wouldn't stop
until I got them.

68
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,804
We always had
a ball in the house.

69
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,430
The boys, his brothers,

70
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,809
started in college too,

71
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,229
and through them,
he played a lot

72
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,814
with the ball.

73
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,735
<i>I saw my brother Horacio
in the press,</i>

74
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:37,945
<i>on the TV,</i>

75
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,699
<i>and how important it was
to go to the Olympic Games.</i>

76
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,994
And I was jealous
because I wanted

77
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,621
to go to the Olympic Games.

78
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,000
<i>When I was 14,
almost 15 years old,</i>

79
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,418
<i>he tried me.</i>

80
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,713
<i>"I want to go," he said.</i>

81
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,466
<i>Since he was short,
his brother Horacio</i>

82
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,470
<i>said they wouldn't take him,
because he was a small kid.</i>

83
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,182
<i>His dad didn't want
to send him away,</i>

84
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,978
<i>that he should stay,
and I was in charge of him.</i>

85
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,062
<i>So I left him</i>

86
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,189
<i>and they took him.</i>

87
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,358
<i>A boy came,</i>

88
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:20,904
<i>an actual child,
he was 14 or 15.</i>

89
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,366
<i>We played in Amecameca
against the Amecameca selection.</i>

90
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,453
<i>He was there in a tiny stadium,</i>

91
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,539
<i>it housed around 3000 people,
but it was full.</i>

92
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:34,001
<i>They were fat, potbellied, shot.</i>

93
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,837
They mopped the floor with us.

94
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,467
<i>They beat us!
We got in the truck</i>

95
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:44,303
<i>and the only one that was crying</i>

96
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,263
<i>was Hugo.</i>

97
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,182
<i>So I said, "Hugo,</i>

98
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,559
<i>why are you crying?"</i>

99
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,187
{\an8}"For the first time in my life

100
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,689
{\an8}I didn't score a goal!"

101
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,276
And I said, "Hugo,

102
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:02,529
this is Amecameca.
No one will know."

103
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,115
"But I will."

104
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,248
I got accepted
in the Olympic Team,

105
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:16,043
to play in different
international games,

106
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,419
like the CANNES tournament,

107
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,131
<i>where I got nicknamed
"The Golden Child,"</i>

108
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,927
<i>the Tulum Tournament,
in '75, '76,</i>

109
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,388
<i>then the Pan Am Games in '75,</i>

110
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,100
<i>and, finally,
the Olympic Games of '76.</i>

111
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,144
<i>Goal!</i>

112
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,147
<i>It was a dream</i>

113
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,275
<i>that I wanted to come true,</i>

114
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,694
<i>and at that age,</i>

115
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:47,199
12 years old,
I thought how I'd love

116
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,161
to be able to play
with the National Team

117
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,871
<i>shirt on</i>

118
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,915
<i>and play in the Aztec Stadium.</i>

119
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,546
<i>Those are dreams
that you harbor as a child</i>

120
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,715
and, luckily, you attain them.

121
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,426
<i>Hugo arrived at the right time,</i>

122
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,304
<i>at the correct hour
and the perfect place.</i>

123
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:13,058
{\an8}University Pumas,
in the 70s and 80s.

124
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,894
{\an8}The best quarry
in Mexican football at the time.

125
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,688
MEXICO CITY
UNAM, 1976

126
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,273
<i>Gold and blue</i>

127
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:23,777
<i>are traditional colors,
it's very prestigious,</i>

128
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:28,699
<i>it has a seal of approval,
you are proud to be there</i>

129
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:33,495
or to belong
to a successful community.

130
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,207
<i>I saw a young man
who talked about things</i>

131
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,959
<i>we weren't used to listen to.</i>

132
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,337
<i>A 17, 18-year-old Hugo Sanchez
who said</i>

133
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,548
<i>not that he would be
the best Pumas player,</i>

134
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,884
{\an8}nor the best Mexican player,

135
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,469
{\an8}but the best player in the world.

136
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:56,226
<i>When you entered the Pumas'
dressing room at that time,</i>

137
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:00,689
<i>you entered and saw the players
who back then</i>

138
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,942
<i>were whole figures,
were already cracks.</i>

139
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:08,071
<i>In my Monterrey versus Tigres debut</i>

140
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,116
<i>I arrived with the illusion
and the energy</i>

141
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,660
<i>of living my dream of being a pro.</i>

142
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,705
<i>I was fortunate to make Cabinho</i>

143
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,082
<i>a pass to score the winning goal</i>

144
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,044
<i>and we won Tigres
as visiting with my debut.</i>

145
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,672
<i>And the coach back then,
Jorge Manrique,</i>

146
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,841
<i>may he rest in peace,</i>

147
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,178
<i>he was gradually helping me
and got me in as substitute</i>

148
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,849
and I hung around those

149
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,143
who I knew that could help me

150
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:41,813
to achieve my next target,
which was to be a starter player.

151
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,024
<i>Muñante was the forward,</i>

152
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,111
<i>a spectacular Peruvian,
Cabinho, an impressive scorer,</i>

153
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:53,242
<i>and Candido, a young Brazilian.
Hugo replaced Candido,</i>

154
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,786
and he slowly took over
Candido's place,

155
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,287
until Hugo Sanchez stayed
as starter.

156
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,624
<i>When I became the Pumas coach</i>

157
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,293
<i>during the '77-'78 season,</i>

158
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,420
{\an8}it was my destiny

159
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,131
{\an8}that a boy named Hugo arrived

160
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,260
<i>and I was lucky to work with him</i>

161
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,262
<i>training in the basic forces.</i>

162
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:16,640
<i>He scored amazing goals.</i>

163
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,310
{\an8}Hugo Sanchez'
great launch in Mexican football

164
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,688
{\an8}came when, in March '77,

165
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,107
at the Aztec,
scored with a free kick

166
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,401
when he came as sub,
Pumas scored against America,

167
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,861
and people got to know Hugo Sanchez.

168
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,905
<i>I celebrated greatly</i>

169
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,241
<i>because it was my first
professional goal.</i>

170
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,870
And it was right here,
in this beautiful stadium.

171
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:43,125
Bora was who explained me

172
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,836
that last season finished
with the same score.

173
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,964
So my job is to tighten up
a little bit more

174
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,590
in this second round.

175
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,303
<i>I tried to convince him
to play center forward,</i>

176
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,096
<i>because, due to his qualities,</i>

177
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,684
<i>it would be better for him
to be close to the goal.</i>

178
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,730
<i>He didn't like the idea.
He hardly agreed</i>

179
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,858
<i>to play that game against Potosino.</i>

180
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,528
He scored three goals
and in the press conference

181
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,947
people asked, "Hey, Hugo,

182
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,742
today you played in a new position.

183
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,786
You played center forward
with Cabinho,"

184
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,664
and he said,
"It was hard to convince Bora

185
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,333
to put me in this position."

186
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:30,005
<i>We played a game,
Pumas versus Atlante,</i>

187
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,382
<i>and I scored three goals.</i>

188
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,762
{\an8}I see his profile,
turning his back to me.

189
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,848
{\an8}He was not going to head the ball,

190
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,683
<i>but he'd attempt a scissor kick.</i>

191
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,394
<i>It was not Chilean,
it was a scissors.</i>

192
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,857
<i>I was standing well, I swear,</i>

193
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,318
and I even touched it.

194
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,613
Goal!
Sure!

195
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:58,658
Imagine the press,
Hugo scored a goal against me,

196
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,702
I was no one next to him.

197
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,705
<i>Not anyone has that resource.</i>

198
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,041
<i>Only the great ones.</i>

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,212
<i>Coincidentally,
during the next season</i>

200
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,591
I scored three goals again.

201
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,469
We defeated Atlante
in Ciudad Universitaria

202
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,139
and I scored
with a "Chilena" again.

203
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,475
After the game,
they ask you questions.

204
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,937
And there was a moment of genius,
it was genius,

205
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,940
<i>where I said a little mad,
after the game,</i>

206
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,233
<i>I said,
"It was a lucky goal."</i>

207
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,818
<i>I scored six goals in two games.</i>

208
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:37,114
I don't know
if it goes without merit,

209
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,700
because it was easy to me.

210
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:48,583
{\an8}HIS ARRIVAL TO SPAIN

211
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,421
<i>I wanted to be
in an important team in Europe,</i>

212
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,632
<i>and Atletico de Madrid offered me
that possibility.</i>

213
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,469
I concluded the World Cup
is in '82,

214
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,679
here in Spain.

215
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,557
The eyes of the world
will be set on this country.

216
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:16,027
It was wonderful to embark
on the adventure

217
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,029
of going to Spain, I was single,

218
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,617
<i>and being young at 23,</i>

219
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,995
<i>I married Emma Portugal.</i>

220
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,166
<i>Four years later, Hugo was born.</i>

221
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,878
<i>That helped me value family.</i>

222
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,588
<i>I didn't value it
when I got married</i>

223
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:39,217
because, more than marrying
Emma Portugal,

224
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,677
I married football.

225
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,347
And she was the partner
that helped me

226
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,391
through difficult times.

227
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,518
When Hugo was born first,

228
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:52,856
<i>and Hemma three years later,
was fantastic</i>

229
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,026
<i>because I reaffirmed what it is</i>

230
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,361
<i>to live with a family
and to have a family,</i>

231
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,863
<i>and to have a responsibility</i>

232
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:03,158
<i>as a father, and as husband too.</i>

233
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,660
<i>So I</i>

234
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,038
wanted to achieve goals

235
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,290
and very large objectives

236
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,626
and their mother wasn't

237
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,378
very thrilled with the idea.

238
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,841
So we both agreed

239
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,761
to split.

240
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,096
And Hugo and Hemma
understood it later.

241
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,183
<i>To have a family
and being married</i>

242
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,726
<i>did not affect me,</i>

243
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,523
<i>and it didn't stop me
from asking myself</i>

244
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,274
what do I want, the family

245
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,235
or the football?

246
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,028
If they had asked,

247
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,030
what comes first
family or football?

248
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,033
I would sadly say

249
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,743
that football.

250
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,962
<i>As a 4, 5-year-old girl</i>

251
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,798
you don't understand

252
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,217
<i>why dad isn't here.</i>

253
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,179
<i>Until later you start to realize,</i>

254
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,598
<i>badly, because you get used</i>

255
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,850
<i>to things being like that.</i>

256
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,479
<i>Why there are cameras around him.</i>

257
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,148
<i>You don't understand
why all the time</i>

258
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,818
<i>people ask for an autograph,
a photo.</i>

259
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:25,991
{\an8}And you understand
that your dad is working.

260
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,161
<i>And I thought and said,
"I'm achieving</i>

261
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:33,290
<i>another dream, another goal"</i>

262
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,500
<i>which was to come and play in Europe,</i>

263
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,836
<i>in a great team like Atletico Madrid.</i>

264
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,880
<i>But the preseason started</i>

265
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,841
<i>and I suddenly hear</i>

266
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,010
<i>and find out that</i>

267
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,220
<i>the coach that had hired me,</i>

268
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,515
<i>with the technical secretary,
were gone.</i>

269
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,058
<i>My support</i>

270
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,812
in the board
and with the coach were absent.

271
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,397
They brought another coach,

272
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,151
named Luis Cid Carriega,
who had me as substitute,

273
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,237
<i>He didn't give me a chance
to prove myself.</i>

274
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,413
FAILURE IN HONDURAS 1981...

275
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:15,999
The definitive game came,

276
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,752
Mexico stumbles in some matches.
It was hard.

277
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,253
<i>They played in Honduras.</i>

278
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,296
<i>The field...</i>

279
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,132
<i>is complicated
the audience is aggressive,</i>

280
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,800
<i>the referee was biased.</i>

281
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:31,097
<i>There, he had to take the blame for
a bad selection.</i>

282
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:39,939
I was starting again
my training adventure

283
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,150
when I returned to Spain,

284
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,527
I received the great news

285
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,781
that the coach who had hired me
was back.

286
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,574
<i>I met Alfonso Cabeza,</i>

287
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,368
<i>who was the president then,</i>

288
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,120
<i>He said, "Hugo,
if you really want to stay here,</i>

289
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,706
<i>you have to waive 50%</i>

290
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,708
<i>of your contract."</i>

291
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,920
<i>He tried to break my contract
with Pumas</i>

292
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,880
<i>with the engineer
Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez.</i>

293
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:08,510
{\an8}And Alvarez said,
"They won't give him back to us.

294
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,719
{\an8}Hugo will fulfill his dream.

295
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,347
{\an8}There is a contract
and you can't return him."

296
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,557
{\an8}Pumas fully supports Hugo.

297
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,811
I don't care to earn the half,

298
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,855
just to prove that I will succeed,

299
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:24,359
and I will show my capacity
and my talent here in the field.

300
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:28,405
<i>Indio! Indio! Indio!</i>

301
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,865
<i>Indio! Indio! Indio!</i>

302
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,492
<i>I was in Camp Nou,</i>

303
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,204
<i>watching Barcelona play
against Atletico Madrid,</i>

304
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,082
<i>when Hugo had just arrived to Spain.</i>

305
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,876
<i>Those mean enthusiasts shouted</i>

306
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,340
<i>"Indio" at Hugo Sanchez.
It's hard to overcome</i>

307
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,801
<i>this emotional lynching</i>

308
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,345
<i>that was reproduced
in every stadium.</i>

309
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:56,433
Hugo armored himself against that,

310
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:02,021
losing certain charm,
a certain charisma

311
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,649
that the Mexican enthusiasts
would have preferred.

312
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,902
But you must understand his history
within this context.

313
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,615
<i>It was surprising
that everyone agreed</i>

314
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,616
<i>and said,</i>

315
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,076
<i>"Indio! Bastard!"</i>

316
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,162
<i>Outside the Molinon, for example.</i>

317
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,915
It was one of the chants
the whole stadium made.

318
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,878
And they thought that shouting
"Indio" at me

319
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:28,590
they would bring me down
or I would feel less.

320
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:33,386
<i>I turned those insults
into something positive,</i>

321
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:38,641
<i>and it motivated me.
And dignity and pride</i>

322
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:42,937
<i>gave me strength because I knew
they were aware of me.</i>

323
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:46,316
<i>And their being aware
made me feel more important.</i>

324
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,613
<i>I received a Spanish journal</i>

325
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:56,075
and the front cover said,
"Hugo, a failure."

326
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,163
He didn't measure up
to the first games.

327
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,712
<i>His first year in Madrid,
was really hard.</i>

328
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:12,383
{\an8}A Mexican player succeeding
in Europe

329
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:17,138
back then, was unheard of.

330
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,059
<i>It was difficult for him,</i>

331
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,520
<i>in the center of the field,
to make a good play,</i>

332
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,479
<i>because it was not his thing,</i>

333
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:28,441
but from three quarters up,
he was lethal.

334
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:33,238
He had it in his head
that he could not leave Mexico

335
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,615
and come back without succeeding,
right?

336
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:42,539
And that ambition led him to try
and work with the utmost interest.

337
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,499
And then his conditions,

338
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,000
conditions as a goal scorer,

339
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,336
I have never seen another one
in my life,

340
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,421
in the way he acted,

341
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,965
in the way he looked for the goal,
right?

342
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,300
{\an8}He changed those,
"Go back, Indio!"

343
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,760
{\an8}for white handkerchiefs

344
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,555
<i>that the Spaniards waved
everywhere</i>

345
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,139
<i>Hugo returns and scores goals.</i>

346
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,476
There was an As journal
front cover

347
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,229
that said, "That's the way, buddy."

348
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,398
<i>With Atletico Madrid</i>

349
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,483
<i>I had the chance to win</i>

350
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,068
<i>my first Pichichi</i>

351
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,153
<i>and then the Copa del Rey.</i>

352
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:20,076
<i>I got a call from Ramon Mendoza,</i>

353
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,078
<i>who'd become Real Madrid's president.</i>

354
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,330
<i>He wanted to interview me</i>

355
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,876
<i>I observed the importance,
the greatness,</i>

356
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:31,045
<i>and the mindset
of always winning titles</i>

357
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,046
<i>in Real Madrid.</i>

358
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,924
<i>And what I'd like
is to win titles.</i>

359
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:39,220
<i>When I received the proposal
from Real Madrid,</i>

360
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,472
<i>I was heading
to Vicente Calderon's office</i>

361
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,474
and, to soften him up,

362
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,103
I took my little son Hugo
in my arms

363
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,148
to tell him,
"Please, don Vicente, help me.

364
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,274
<i>I want to go with Real Madrid,</i>

365
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,193
<i>because it's the team
where I want to get more titles</i>

366
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:57,196
<i>and I have the chance to be there.
Please."</i>

367
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,908
<i>Until he said, "Hugo,
it's okay. I'll help you.</i>

368
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:03,036
<i>But I can't negotiate directly."</i>

369
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,997
I thought of taking
the Pumas president,

370
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,624
engineer Guillermo Aguilar,

371
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,958
to help me out

372
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:13,254
by having Pumas buy me again

373
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,673
<i>to supposedly sign with Pumas,</i>

374
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:18,676
<i>but then Pumas
would sell me to Real Madrid.</i>

375
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,554
<i>The Club Atletico Madrid
president agreed</i>

376
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,389
{\an8}with the Real Madrid president

377
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,433
{\an8}to manage it that way

378
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,226
{\an8}because Hugo wanted to come
with Real Madrid

379
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,355
{\an8}and to do it directly
was a slap in the face

380
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,315
to the Club Atletico president.

381
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,654
<i>Finally Ramon Mendoza,
Madrid's president, came</i>

382
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:44,202
<i>and had the idea to carry over</i>

383
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,579
<i>three or four stronghold players.</i>

384
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:51,417
<i>We came from rage, a football
with no discourse, aesthetic.</i>

385
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,587
<i>When Franco dies,
the transition starts.</i>

386
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,717
<i>Spain feels European,
feels free.</i>

387
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,179
And football,
which usually translates

388
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,767
the social pulse,
brought a generation

389
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,812
<i>with an amount of players,</i>

390
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:14,148
<i>that played very well,
a very delicate football.</i>

391
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,943
<i>We represented intuition,</i>

392
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,570
<i>intelligence, creativity,</i>

393
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:23,032
inspiration, something different.

394
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,368
{\an8}They complemented very well.

395
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,162
{\an8}Maceda, Gordillo
and Hugo Sanchez,

396
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,330
who were the pillars

397
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:32,250
on which that team was built.

398
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,086
They made such an important team

399
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,381
that they called it
Real Madrid's Second Golden Age.

400
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,467
{\an8}Little by little,
they were realizing

401
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,763
{\an8}that he was important,
necessary, vital

402
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:49,225
for a group,
even if it was Real Madrid,

403
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:52,311
and that made him get more involved

404
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:54,981
and deliver greatly, as always.

405
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,233
{\an8}Hugo was not surrounded
by his countrymen.

406
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,570
{\an8}He was miles away from Mexico,

407
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,573
in a terribly demanding club,

408
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,783
with a different football concept
than America.

409
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,119
But he got over all of that.

410
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,288
He came to Madrid
and there he succeeded.

411
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,917
<i>He won over the Madrilenians,</i>

412
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,670
{\an8}he won the followers,
the people's hearts

413
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:21,424
{\an8}for his dedication, his conviction,
his character,

414
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:22,717
<i>and on top of that,</i>

415
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,636
<i>an extraordinary performance
as a goal scorer.</i>

416
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,098
<i>An aggressive attack player
who has fun.</i>

417
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:39,817
<i>The goal of my dreams</i>

418
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:42,320
<i>was a goal with a "Chilena",
from my father's influence,</i>

419
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,615
<i>for he was the reason
I practiced since I was 4.</i>

420
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,160
<i>I practiced a thousand times.</i>

421
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,330
<i>And I made that kick my favorite</i>

422
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:53,706
<i>and I perfected it.</i>

423
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,215
<i>Goal!</i>

424
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:07,345
<i>Again in Santiago Bernabeu,</i>

425
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,388
<i>sporting the Real Madrid shirt,</i>

426
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:10,681
<i>I scored with a "Chilena"</i>

427
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,351
<i>and I made my dream come true.</i>

428
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:17,563
That goal went down in history

429
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:19,941
and its aesthetic, because

430
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,154
it perfectly showed
what kind of forward

431
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,614
and what possibilities he had.

432
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,868
<i>It's not a coincidence
that 38 goals or a right touch,</i>

433
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:33,538
<i>left, head, penalty,</i>

434
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:37,041
<i>does not make any sense,</i>

435
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,793
<i>because he made no sense.</i>

436
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,712
<i>He was a star.
He was gifted.</i>

437
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:46,008
He scored 38 goals in a season,
with first intention.

438
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,386
That's a phenomenon.

439
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,556
<i>As a player,
as a center forward,</i>

440
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,850
<i>there's hardly anyone better.</i>

441
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,729
WORLD CUP
MEXICO, 1986

442
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,189
<i>The '86 World Cup</i>

443
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:03,651
<i>meant a return to the World Cups
for Hugo Sanchez,</i>

444
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:08,781
<i>go back to his country
as a triumphant idol in Spain.</i>

445
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,033
<i>It was a hard to beat team.</i>

446
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,579
<i>We lost very few games.</i>

447
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:20,126
{\an8}A well-coordinated team
in its playing style,

448
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:24,255
and we were missing
the important piece

449
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,383
who couldn't be with us,
who was Hugo Sanchez.

450
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,010
It was totally shameful

451
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,553
for the rest of the players

452
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,388
the treatment they gave
Hugo Sanchez.

453
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,267
<i>Imagine a Hollywood superstar</i>

454
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,562
<i>and the rest of them were
mere mortals.</i>

455
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:41,898
If you have a guy
that wins every year

456
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,524
the scoring championship in Spain,

457
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,860
which is a world-renowned league,

458
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:48,988
will you spare him from your team?

459
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,157
<i>Will you tell Hugo Sanchez,</i>

460
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,659
<i>"Don't come.
I have a group of friends</i>

461
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,703
<i>that have a good time
and play in Mexico."</i>

462
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:58,372
<i>When you have a goal
with your team,</i>

463
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,709
<i>the least you can do is agree</i>

464
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,669
<i>on how to defend or attack,</i>

465
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:05,421
<i>where is everyone going.</i>

466
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,423
{\an8}There was none of that.

467
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,176
{\an8}And that screwed the group.

468
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,347
{\an8}He showed in the field
and in training

469
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:18,976
{\an8}that he's one of the best,

470
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,603
but the people

471
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,063
say this,

472
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,273
{\an8}<i>Bora gave him advantage.</i>

473
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,072
<i>He didn't want
to blend in the group,</i>

474
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,032
<i>but the group to accommodate</i>

475
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,452
<i>to his way of being,
thinking, playing.</i>

476
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,747
There were many unspoken clashes,

477
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,332
but of course there were clashes.

478
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,626
I remember a National Team player

479
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:47,755
said before the World Cup,
"Hugo come, let's see what he finds."

480
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,261
<i>He took a Spanish accent.</i>

481
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,139
That annoyed some teammates.

482
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,976
Even the coach.

483
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,938
<i>He asked me to talk to him,</i>

484
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,151
which I found to be
a ridiculous request,

485
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,029
because it was like
not respecting

486
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:14,907
the way he was.

487
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:16,575
{\an8}Bora gave instructions,

488
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,160
{\an8}"We'll run this way,"

489
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,663
{\an8}and Hugo,
and I'm telling the truth,

490
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:24,208
naturally said,
"Bora, can I make a suggest?

491
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:26,127
In Real Madrid,
Butragueño gives me the ball

492
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,670
and I rely on Michel,
who centers."

493
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,339
The group said, "Son of a gun!

494
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,008
What's with this guy?"

495
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,553
<i>Hugo, as an icon, arrived</i>

496
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,848
{\an8}acting like team captain.

497
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,308
{\an8}He deserved it.

498
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:43,227
{\an8}But there were people who had

499
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:46,564
{\an8}worked for three years,
like Tomas Boy.

500
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:50,901
<i>They asked me to please,</i>

501
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:54,822
<i>be more humble, down to earth,</i>

502
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:57,658
<i>they said they talked</i>

503
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:00,411
<i>and that I wouldn't be made
team captain,</i>

504
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:03,706
<i>because, if I was made team captain,</i>

505
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:07,126
<i>there would be
more envy and jealousy.</i>

506
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:10,588
It's unbelievable
they didn't let me be captain

507
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,216
because of their mentality
and jealousy.

508
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:18,429
I think they should have
asked me politely

509
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,723
to be the leader, the captain,

510
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:24,477
because I was succeeding
outside of Mexico.

511
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:29,357
<i>Tomas was the captain
who wore the badge,</i>

512
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:33,402
<i>and we sat down
and I remember that in that meeting</i>

513
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,280
<i>Tomas and I commented</i>

514
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:39,075
<i>that the group was a little restless</i>

515
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,410
<i>regarding Hugo's behavior.</i>

516
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,080
<i>And Hugo</i>

517
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,290
<i>said the same.
"This is sad.</i>

518
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,044
I thought it was a different group,"
he expressed,

519
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,630
because he had been
in two previous

520
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:53,714
World Cups, '78 and '82,

521
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:56,133
where he perceived,
I wasn't there,

522
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:00,179
factions, jealousy,
insecurities, small team,

523
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:04,225
and he clashed with that,
and he felt that '86 was,

524
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:07,395
<i>finally, a competitive, winning,</i>

525
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:08,604
<i>protagonist team.</i>

526
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,733
<i>The World Cup '86 is for Hugo</i>

527
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,527
the Cup at home,
where he is and idol,

528
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,028
and he's expected,

529
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:19,949
and he arrives with an injury
from a game in Europe.

530
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,577
<i>He had a different commitment
from everyone else.</i>

531
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:27,206
So, surely,
the coaching team decided that Hugo

532
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,166
would be granted
certain concessions.

533
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,461
<i>They were asking me to lower</i>

534
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,839
<i>my performance to their level.</i>

535
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:39,176
And I said, "Why don't you
rise up to my mentality,

536
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,845
my football level,

537
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:44,098
<i>and that leadership I've earned,</i>

538
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,516
<i>why don't you have it too?"</i>

539
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,768
<i>He said, "It's too hard.</i>

540
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:49,603
<i>We are not like you.</i>

541
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:52,231
<i>We are limited
and we have problems."</i>

542
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:55,317
<i>I said, "That's not my problem.
It's you problem."</i>

543
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,069
Hugo was here

544
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:58,988
at that time

545
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,449
and the rest of us were here.

546
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,534
There was no one here

547
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:06,245
in the middle, or close

548
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,874
to Hugo in that competition sense.

549
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,376
<i>Hugo, you have to understand</i>

550
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:17,173
<i>that we decided
that the eldest is the captain.</i>

551
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:20,384
We think it's the most convenient.

552
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:23,971
The eldest, back then,
was Tomas Boy.

553
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,560
I didn't know
he wanted to be captain.

554
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,523
Bora kind of mentioned

555
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,485
that Hugo asked to be captain.

556
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:40,029
But, as I understood,

557
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,532
Bora said he chose me as captain

558
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:46,577
and the rest of the team
chose me as captain.

559
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,497
{\an8}The decision to make
Tomas Boy captain

560
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,832
{\an8}becomes a diplomatic move

561
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:55,169
{\an8}from Bora Milutinovic,
to avoid another kind

562
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,087
<i>of issue.</i>

563
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,507
<i>He chooses a talented guy
with leadership,</i>

564
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,301
which is what you need

565
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,345
to carry the captain band.

566
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:08,349
{\an8}They're all the same to me.

567
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,727
{\an8}Tomas Boy had a lot of merits.

568
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,688
He is captain.
Hugo is third.

569
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:18,776
Hugo never protested against it.

570
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:20,444
What does that show?

571
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,446
That the team was important to him,

572
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,782
the team's spirit,

573
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,742
no matter who was captain.

574
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,119
<i>Later I knew that he thought,</i>

575
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:30,996
<i>since Maradona had been chosen</i>

576
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,999
by his great Argentinian colleagues,

577
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,709
he had to be chosen too,

578
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,127
like him.

579
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,879
{\an8}I didn't get that part.

580
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,005
{\an8}No.

581
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:41,465
{\an8}It's not like,

582
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:43,676
"Stop pretending, Tomas."

583
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,261
They always think that.

584
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:49,014
I never knew
he wanted to be captain.

585
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,560
"Being captain or not,

586
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,229
it doesn't matter to me.

587
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,065
But their way of thinking
is really sad.

588
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:01,068
They have a mediocre mentality."

589
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:16,208
<i>The Coca Cola company
made an important</i>

590
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:19,128
<i>where there was a minute left
and Hugo Sanchez</i>

591
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,588
shot a penalty and scored.

592
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:22,506
And he played against Paraguay,

593
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,634
there's a minute left,
it's made for TV.

594
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:27,177
<i>I ran because we went live</i>

595
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:31,515
<i>and I go out, there's a stand,
Coca Cola and the shot.</i>

596
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,852
<i>Hugo Sanchez was that ad
in front of my eyes</i>

597
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,604
<i>with a different ending.</i>

598
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:38,981
I remember Hugo took the ball.

599
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,066
{\an8}Aguirre could have shot,
Tomas could have shot,

600
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,527
{\an8}I could have shot, Luis Flores,

601
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:45,112
{\an8}if he was there, I forgot.

602
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,281
<i>But the important thing</i>

603
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,867
<i>is the confidence
to stand up in there.</i>

604
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,285
<i>Not anyone does it.</i>

605
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,623
<i>When I failed at that time</i>

606
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,334
<i>and it was a tie,</i>

607
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,794
I felt human.

608
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,257
<i>How would you feel
when a player like Luis Flores,</i>

609
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,760
<i>is told, "Go to the bench,</i>

610
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,261
<i>because Hugo Sanchez
is taking your place"?</i>

611
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,554
<i>Imagine.</i>

612
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:13,641
I'm not ousting anyone.

613
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,685
I'm part of a 22 players list.

614
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,271
A process that takes up
many years,

615
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:22,191
and there's a decision
that leaves you out.

616
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:23,734
<i>You'll be starting?</i>

617
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,987
That depends on the coach.

618
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:30,783
<i>They will hang Bora
in Mexico City's Zocalo.</i>

619
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:31,825
Exactly.

620
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:34,703
He will assume that responsibility

621
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:39,249
and he will take the risk,
if that happens.

622
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,378
<i>We played the fifth game
against Germany.</i>

623
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,588
<i>We played really well.</i>

624
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:47,007
<i>We had many chances to score.
The Colombian referee</i>

625
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,677
<i>canceled my goal,
Aguirre was really close.</i>

626
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,513
<i>When we get to penalties,</i>

627
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:56,183
<i>none of us believed
that we would arrive to that.</i>

628
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,812
{\an8}<i>When Bora asked, "Who's shooting"
Nobody stepped in.</i>

629
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,523
<i>Everyone cramped.
Tomas cramped.</i>

630
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,817
<i>Quirarte cramped.
Hugo Sanchez cramped.</i>

631
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,193
{\an8}Nobody shot the penalties.

632
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,945
{\an8}They look like defenses
shooting penalties

633
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,780
<i>in front of a goalkeeper
like Schumacher.</i>

634
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:19,498
<i>The possibility of Hugo
reversed what he had done</i>

635
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,000
{\an8}in that World Cup,
shooting the penalty

636
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:25,629
{\an8}and scoring, helping Mexico
to go over Germany,

637
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:27,339
{\an8}would have changed
the rest of History.

638
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,258
Despite that,

639
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,302
{\an8}from my outside point of view,

640
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,388
{\an8}as a journalist that watches the Cup

641
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:37,808
and broadcasts it,
I always saw him

642
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,810
<i>give his all in the World Cup.</i>

643
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,188
<i>The World Cup is also politics.</i>

644
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:44,732
<i>They always say,</i>

645
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:47,735
<i>"The referee helped the local team,
because they're local".</i>

646
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,070
{\an8}<i>But the referee didn't help here.</i>

647
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:51,822
{\an8}<i>Mexico didn't help itself</i>

648
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:55,367
{\an8}<i>protecting its own interests
since the schedule design.</i>

649
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:58,370
Who always has the preference?
The local.

650
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,165
It wasn't the players' fault,

651
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,292
nor Bora's, nor Hugo's,
nor anyone else's.

652
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:05,335
You just take them out
of their fortress,

653
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,045
<i>the Aztec,
and they become vulnerable.</i>

654
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:21,518
Any player
who performs below expectations

655
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:24,438
gets disproportionate criticism.

656
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:29,151
<i>And no one garnered more expectation
than Hugo Sanchez in Mexico.</i>

657
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:35,991
<i>I met Isabel,</i>

658
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,036
<i>my current wife, in '90.
It was love at first sight</i>

659
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,873
<i>and we haven't been apart since.</i>

660
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:48,128
Hugo made me feel the most
wonderful person in the world.

661
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,671
{\an8}I was a princess

662
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,091
{\an8}and all he wanted was
that I was happy.

663
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,761
{\an8}The rest of the world
disappeared for a while.

664
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,596
<i>Hugo is very protective.</i>

665
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,682
The priest that married us
came at the end of the ceremony

666
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:01,892
to say goodbye,

667
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:04,853
and he says,
"What's your problem? She's my wife.

668
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,396
Why are you talking to her?"

669
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,816
And he says, "Sorry, Hugo!

670
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,567
I was just saying goodbye."

671
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,611
"I'm sorry, but she's my wife."

672
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:14,947
You can't be jealous
of the priest

673
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,281
that just married her.

674
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,035
<i>We waited a few years,</i>

675
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,288
<i>to enjoy a childless marriage</i>

676
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:26,250
<i>until she got pregnant.
And,</i>

677
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,586
<i>thank God, they were two.</i>

678
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:30,796
<i>Isabela and Hana.</i>

679
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:36,343
I was lucky to find him at a time

680
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:41,390
when he had practically achieved
everything he ever dreamed of.

681
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,934
<i>Imagine the euphoria.</i>

682
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,312
<i>He was conquering the world,
at that time</i>

683
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,314
<i>it belonged to him.
He was the center</i>

684
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,024
<i>because, in football,</i>

685
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:53,151
<i>being Real Madrid's center forward</i>

686
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:54,820
<i>is the center of the world.</i>

687
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,282
<i>He was that back then
and he was scoring</i>

688
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:01,243
<i>two or three goals every week.</i>

689
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,497
He felt that rush you get
when you do everything right.

690
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:08,125
When things you thought of doing
turn out right.

691
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:11,837
<i>He had the traits of a born winner,</i>

692
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,965
and he fundamentally showed
the ambition,

693
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:18,218
{\an8}a determination out of the ordinary.

694
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:19,469
I confronted Hugo

695
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:23,056
and he had no friends.

696
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,683
He was a

697
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,144
killer.
If he had to step on you,

698
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,521
elbow you,
spit on you, threaten you

699
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,482
<i>and score, he would.
He had no remorse.</i>

700
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:37,613
{\an8}Many of the things he accomplished

701
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,240
{\an8}were because he said,
"I'll be the best."

702
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,326
{\an8}When you say,
"I'm the best one here,

703
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,201
<i>or I want to be
or will be the best,</i>

704
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:44,536
<i>or I'm the best,"</i>

705
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:48,332
<i>it seems wrong, it hurts</i>

706
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:52,377
<i>and we vent national miseries
that burden us.</i>

707
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,297
Since I was a child, I didn't

708
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,343
have such a strong personality,
temper,

709
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,972
but when I became a pro
ad went to Spain

710
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:07,100
<i>and I lived outside my country,</i>

711
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:09,978
<i>away from my surroundings,
my family, my friends,</i>

712
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,606
<i>it hardened my temper</i>

713
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:16,068
<i>and my personality
became more defined.</i>

714
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:19,154
<i>For the first time
in Mexican football's history</i>

715
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,367
{\an8}someone crossed the borders
and wasn't

716
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:28,372
{\an8}shy enough to be great.

717
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:32,834
<i>In Mexico, success divides people.</i>

718
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:36,171
<i>We have this attitude
of feeling beneath</i>

719
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,632
and if someone goes away

720
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:41,635
{\an8}to triumph,
they have abandoned us.

721
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,930
{\an8}It's the apostate leaving the tribe.

722
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,059
<i>It's called envy.</i>

723
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,687
<i>It's the pain of not being.</i>

724
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:56,191
<i>Envy, seeing another succeed
while you don't.</i>

725
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,860
<i>It blinds you</i>

726
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,989
<i>and you don't see why
such person succeeded.</i>

727
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:05,492
Sure!
You have to be blind, crazy and sick

728
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:10,455
in your head,
and boiling with envy and jealousy

729
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:14,251
to not see the work

730
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:15,961
of Hugo Sanchez.

731
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:21,174
<i>In that trade,
you can't project weakness</i>

732
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:22,676
<i>or gratitude.</i>

733
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:26,346
<i>He was competing
next to big players</i>

734
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,390
{\an8}and he had to feel that way,

735
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:32,686
{\an8}with a certain dose of arrogance.

736
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,940
<i>The Hugo from Jardin Balbuena
is the same as now.</i>

737
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:39,776
<i>That's what's magic about him.</i>

738
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:43,822
He's a guy that has no need

739
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,868
to show people that he's wealthy
or that he's powerful.

740
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:50,162
He never carries that flag.

741
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,000
<i>He's a person that has done.</i>

742
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,836
He's had like a script

743
00:38:58,462 --> 00:39:00,964
of his life,
since he was a child.

744
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:05,677
<i>And he followed it,</i>

745
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:08,388
<i>and to get what I want</i>

746
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:09,848
<i>I will do this."</i>

747
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:15,145
{\an8}He decided he wanted to be
the best player in Mexico

748
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:18,148
{\an8}and he achieved that.

749
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:19,858
<i>The truth, it is something that...</i>

750
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,486
<i>many people admire,
I admire him,</i>

751
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,530
<i>it is something very difficult
to achieved</i>

752
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:29,910
<i>it is a source of pride for me.</i>

753
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:33,455
{\an8}He must relax and not be so...

754
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:36,541
like...

755
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,168
anxious, controlling.

756
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,713
<i>He exerts an excessive control.</i>

757
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:44,633
<i>It's excessive because
he wants to control everything.</i>

758
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:48,512
Everything.
And some things are not for him.

759
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:55,685
<i>He does not think of himself,
he thinks of the good of all.</i>

760
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,607
<i>I just want to thank him for...</i>

761
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,904
helping me to be the way I am now.

762
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:09,491
<i>I love him very much,
he is my father.</i>

763
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,120
"Dad, I can't be the best
at everything.

764
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:16,039
I will try, but no.

765
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,835
I can't be the best at everything."

766
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:23,046
<i>"Well, try and do your best</i>

767
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:27,551
<i>to at least get close to perfection."</i>

768
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:32,139
The mindset plays a big role

769
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:34,015
in wanting to be different

770
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:37,185
and standing out.

771
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:42,482
That guideline, that awareness

772
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:45,026
that my mother gave me,
she wanted me to be the best,

773
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:48,572
it helped me
and I took it seriously.

774
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,616
I won't be the best at everything,
but I will be closer

775
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,702
than others who don't try to.

776
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:59,916
<i>The second and third years
helped me improve</i>

777
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,795
<i>my productivity
in goals and in playing.</i>

778
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,256
<i>And Leo Beenhakker left</i>

779
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:09,217
<i>after winning the third title
in a row.</i>

780
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:12,387
<i>Before the championship was over,</i>

781
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,599
it was like warning the manager

782
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,601
to bring another forward
instead of Hugo,

783
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:21,062
<i>because Hugo was getting old
in football.</i>

784
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:27,611
BACK TO MEXICO
CLUB AMERICA 1992...

785
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,405
<i>America offered to pay me the same</i>

786
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,823
<i>that Real Madrid was paying me.</i>

787
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:34,993
<i>I accepted looking forward
to the '94 World Cup.</i>

788
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,287
<i>I thought it was</i>

789
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,539
<i>a good way to return to Mexico.</i>

790
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:43,376
<i>Do you remember
the day of your debut</i>

791
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:45,712
<i>in Leon, America?</i>

792
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:48,715
<i>We were losing 1 to 0.</i>

793
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,801
<i>He scored the goal.</i>

794
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:56,014
{\an8}It was a foul and Hugo is cunning.

795
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:59,976
{\an8}He tried to screw the goalkeeper

796
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:03,021
<i>and it was a free shot
and it was a 1-1 tie.</i>

797
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:07,651
As an Americanist it was unthinkable
that a Pumas player came to America.

798
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,195
An iconic Pumas player
came to America.

799
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:13,490
<i>Without trying,
I'm responsible of the National Team</i>

800
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:18,328
{\an8}and it's part of my fate
and I embraced it.

801
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:20,914
<i>That's when I invited Hugo</i>

802
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:24,542
<i>and I tell him,
"In the National Team,</i>

803
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,670
<i>through history, for many reasons,</i>

804
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,880
<i>you haven't done well
or quite matched.</i>

805
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:33,510
<i>You have a lot of influence
with any group of people.</i>

806
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:38,306
I know this generation,
and they are

807
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,226
talented young people
and you are an example

808
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,187
and you, certainly,

809
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,856
<i>will boost that group.</i>

810
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:51,528
<i>Miguel Mejia Baron,
who always had a close link</i>

811
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:54,239
<i>with Hugo Sanchez,
specially in the beginning,</i>

812
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,408
he had a kinship with Hugo,

813
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,119
{\an8}not only because they had

814
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,288
{\an8}the same career, football, Pumas,

815
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:02,706
{\an8}dentistry,
but there was a kinship.

816
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,249
{\an8}Miguel felt
a great respect for Hugo,

817
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:05,292
{\an8}they had good rapport
and talked a lot.

818
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,501
{\an8}Miguel always expressed

819
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,170
{\an8}that Hugo Sanchez
was his friend.

820
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,715
<i>What we lived in Honduras
was like a war.</i>

821
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:14,926
<i>They gave us awful treatment
since we arrived,</i>

822
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,553
<i>they threw rock at the bus,</i>

823
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:20,181
<i>they wouldn't let us train,
and they told Hugo,</i>

824
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:24,269
{\an8}"We will break your leg."
And they looked for him.

825
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:27,564
<i>And he was so sly
they could never beat him.</i>

826
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:31,735
<i>And Hugo transmitted
that slyness in every sense.</i>

827
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,097
<i>They celebrated,
for first occasion,</i>

828
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:03,975
the '93 American Cup,
which cost a lot

829
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:07,979
to achieve that Mexico could go
to an American Cup.

830
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:12,734
<i>I told him, "In appreciation to</i>

831
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,235
<i>your whole story</i>

832
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:16,863
<i>and this last stretch you accepted,</i>

833
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:20,784
<i>I'd like you to retire
in the American Cup as captain."</i>

834
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:25,205
His football quality,
his background, his history, his all,

835
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:29,084
he automatically, and unwillingly,
put a distance.

836
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,711
<i>He is the best.
You can't deny it,</i>

837
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:33,129
<i>nor, "I'm taking your place,</i>

838
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:34,172
<i>or give me a good pass."</i>

839
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,966
<i>We even joked,
some of us made lewd jokes</i>

840
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,803
<i>about the mom and the sister,
and the girl and the wife.</i>

841
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,889
<i>He didn't cross the line,
but he fooled around.</i>

842
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,558
<i>He was very affectionate
in those circumstances.</i>

843
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:50,605
<i>I had Luis, Hugo and Zague,</i>

844
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:52,816
<i>and I only wanted to play
with two.</i>

845
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:55,985
<i>I told Luis, "I have this problem."</i>

846
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:59,614
Zague was the apex,
he was the fastest.

847
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:01,199
I needed speed.

848
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:03,910
"It's between you and Hugo."

849
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:06,079
<i>Miguel comes to my room and says,</i>

850
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:08,998
<i>"You won't play.
I will be with the two forwards.</i>

851
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:12,001
They want me to ditch Hugo."

852
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:15,547
{\an8}He literally said,
"They want me to push

853
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:16,881
{\an8}Hugo aside."

854
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,591
{\an8}I would never do that.

855
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:20,260
He says "I'll screw you."

856
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,887
<i>"Don't do that, Miguel."</i>

857
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:26,433
<i>I said, "Yes.
Your time is the future.</i>

858
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:27,976
<i>Hugo is retiring</i>

859
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:30,103
<i>and this is part
of the appreciation."</i>

860
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:35,066
<i>He got very upset.
He threw a tantrum.</i>

861
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:38,445
<i>"You are still starting forward
in '94, the World Cup,</i>

862
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,363
<i>but I must back up Hugo Sanchez</i>

863
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:42,198
<i>and he will play in your place."</i>

864
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,243
<i>It was not just about
having a star,</i>

865
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,454
<i>or to play
accommodating the player.</i>

866
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:49,956
<i>And everyone, including Hugo,</i>

867
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,292
<i>always understood
the collective effort</i>

868
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,878
<i>where everyone has to participate.</i>

869
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,088
<i>In that Hugo Sanchez generation,</i>

870
00:45:57,255 --> 00:46:01,301
<i>the best group of players'
history combined</i>

871
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:03,011
<i>to support the idol.</i>

872
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,221
<i>And that Miguel Mejia Baron's team,</i>

873
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,640
{\an8}of '93 and '94, I believe,

874
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,350
{\an8}along with Lapuente's in'98,

875
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:12,103
{\an8}are the best
in the National Team's history.

876
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,775
<i>Miguel Mejia Baron,
before the final, said.</i>

877
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,904
<i>"Hugo, the time has come
to leave like the great ones,</i>

878
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:23,781
{\an8}in the final we always dreamed of,

879
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,034
{\an8}leave like a God."

880
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:47,180
<i>Unfortunately, we got to the final
against Argentina.</i>

881
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,890
We had an extraordinary
performance

882
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:50,892
and we didn't get the title.

883
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,645
That would have been my last game
with the National Team.

884
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,898
<i>We had a great game.</i>

885
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:00,652
Hugo liked what was happening
with the team.

886
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:03,196
Maybe he didn't think

887
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,323
we could play so well as a team,

888
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:08,785
<i>or be the protagonists,
like we were.</i>

889
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:11,079
<i>That commitment was over
and Hugo says,</i>

890
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,790
"I'd like to go to the World Cup."

891
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:15,124
I said, "Hugo,

892
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,918
we agreed this was the end."

893
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,587
<i>After some time</i>

894
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:22,757
<i>between the American
and the World Cup,</i>

895
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,926
<i>Miguel said,
"I have to leave America,</i>

896
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,595
<i>because I feel a very bad attitude</i>

897
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:30,014
<i>from the America's board.</i>

898
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:33,101
<i>They wanted me to sign
an image contract,</i>

899
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:34,727
<i>and through that</i>

900
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:38,439
<i>I wanted to earn an amount
besides the sports contract.</i>

901
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:43,403
<i>They wouldn't pay that.
It was peanuts.</i>

902
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:47,031
<i>So I deftly told my manager</i>

903
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:48,408
<i>to add a clause</i>

904
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,785
<i>where, if a foreign team</i>

905
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,496
<i>was interested in me,
I could leave.</i>

906
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,628
<i>Hugo Sanchez did two things
when he left America.</i>

907
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:04,215
<i>One, he valued himself
and he looked independent.</i>

908
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:06,718
<i>And to fulfill another dream,
return to Madrid</i>

909
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,429
<i>with a very popular team
like the Rayo Vallecano.</i>

910
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,813
WORLD CUP
USA 1994

911
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,273
<i>I distinctly remember</i>

912
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,191
<i>that the trip from the hotel
to the stadium</i>

913
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,234
<i>was really long.</i>

914
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:24,944
<i>We were all very quiet,</i>

915
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:25,945
<i>save Jorge Campos,</i>

916
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:27,530
<i>who narrated his own game</i>

917
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:29,449
<i>in the backseat.</i>

918
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:30,908
{\an8}And in his own game

919
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:32,744
{\an8}he made frequent mistakes.

920
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:35,121
{\an8}So everyone laughed.

921
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,415
{\an8}An almost nervous laugh.

922
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:39,959
<i>Hugo starts the process.</i>

923
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:41,794
<i>He plays center forward</i>

924
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:44,881
<i>and gets the nine
and is a starter.</i>

925
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,633
<i>He plays as starter the whole game.</i>

926
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:51,971
<i>One of the clearest occasions
I had was a "Chilena" where</i>

927
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:55,558
<i>center came fantastically,</i>

928
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:58,853
And it passed by the post.

929
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,521
So that was

930
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:04,400
a critical moment for my future,

931
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,819
<i>because I'm convinced</i>

932
00:49:06,903 --> 00:49:08,696
<i>that if I had scored,</i>

933
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:12,492
<i>I would have played as starter
in the next game</i>

934
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,870
<i>and it could have been a tie
or we could have overcome.</i>

935
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,581
<i>But the result was we lost</i>

936
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:20,667
<i>and that was my last</i>

937
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,044
<i>official game
with the National Team.</i>

938
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:24,462
<i>And that cap,</i>

939
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,130
<i>which is my favorite,</i>

940
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:28,591
<i>in that case, didn't help me</i>

941
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,134
<i>in the end.</i>

942
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:31,844
Miguel...

943
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:34,889
{\an8}lost that confidence

944
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,600
{\an8}in Hugo's image

945
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:41,312
<i>and doesn't regard him
for the next games.</i>

946
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,231
<i>At that time,</i>

947
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,942
<i>it was like a castle crumbling,</i>

948
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:49,237
<i>like a castle that I had created</i>

949
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,279
<i>and formed, crumbled.</i>

950
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,365
Like I didn't deserve

951
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:57,036
to end my trajectory
with the National Team in that way.

952
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:01,833
<i>Miguel realizes, in my opinion,</i>

953
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:05,920
<i>that he could forego
Hugo Sanchez in the games.</i>

954
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,296
<i>He played in such a way</i>

955
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,173
<i>where he had two fast forwards</i>

956
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,592
<i>and Luis Garcia
was scoring 17 goals</i>

957
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,052
<i>with Atletico Madrid, 16.</i>

958
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:38,119
<i>I think Miguel</i>

959
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,538
<i>didn't want to change
the structure,</i>

960
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,999
but the team was practically

961
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,835
pushed to the background.

962
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:52,258
<i>That day, the Bulgarians
were really worried</i>

963
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,177
<i>because they couldn't catch Zague.</i>

964
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:58,181
{\an8}You couldn't change a player
to change your game scheme

965
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,558
{\an8}when you controlled the game
in other way.

966
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,853
<i>I wanted to keep Zague
with the possibility</i>

967
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:05,521
<i>of arriving with his speed,</i>

968
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:07,857
<i>but someone had
to play Galindo's role.</i>

969
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,568
Tuca was on top.
It took him so he

970
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,820
would see what I couldn't
from below.

971
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:15,490
And I tell

972
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:20,995
{\an8}Memo Vazquez, "Ask Tuca
what he thinks about Galindo?"

973
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:24,123
{\an8}While he found out,
I talk to Hugo.

974
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:28,377
I said, "Warm up,
because you'll probably take

975
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:30,838
Galindo's place."

976
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:33,466
He comes from the bench.

977
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:37,261
{\an8}"Tuca, what do you think
about Hugo as a possibility?"

978
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,263
{\an8}I said, "Instead of who?"

979
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:44,143
There isn't.
"What do you think?"

980
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:47,605
"The three centers
are containing well.

981
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,358
Benjamin Galindo is perfectly

982
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,361
projecting Zague.

983
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:57,490
<i>And Hugo wasn't still
the protagonist of the story.</i>

984
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:58,699
That was terrible for Hugo.

985
00:51:58,783 --> 00:51:59,826
It was terrible for him.

986
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:00,993
He was used to the limelight,

987
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:04,080
{\an8}he was used to be the protagonist,

988
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:05,373
{\an8}to play the lead.

989
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:06,916
{\an8}He was used to score.

990
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,668
For him, it was,

991
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:12,880
and I daresay, unbearable
to be on the bench.

992
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:16,717
<i>In a game that went into overtime</i>

993
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:20,346
you have to have changes.

994
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:24,183
It was strange for us
that there were no changes,

995
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,269
but they were warming up.

996
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:28,312
Those two were warming up.

997
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:32,608
<i>It was obvious to Hugo
that there would be a change.</i>

998
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:34,652
<i>And Hugo feels from outside</i>

999
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,864
<i>that if we go to the front,
we will beat Bulgaria.</i>

1000
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,880
When Miguel finally decides

1001
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,798
I forgot the minute,

1002
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:58,718
he says, "I'll bring Hugo in."

1003
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:01,095
<i>He gets up confidently
and goes to Hugo.</i>

1004
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,348
<i>He wanted me as midfielder
to replace Benjamin Galindo.</i>

1005
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:07,059
I have never played there.

1006
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:08,769
And right now in the game

1007
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:11,898
I said, "I can go get them."

1008
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:15,026
<i>If everyone does everything right,</i>

1009
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,445
<i>why do I have to change that?</i>

1010
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,364
<i>Because they think of refreshing.</i>

1011
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,450
<i>What is refreshing?</i>

1012
00:53:22,575 --> 00:53:24,201
<i>It's taking out a player</i>

1013
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:28,247
that's been doing fine
for 80 minutes

1014
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:32,543
to put one
that you don't know if will work.

1015
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:35,421
And that's why you have to refresh.

1016
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:40,801
It's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1017
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:43,888
Wait a minute!

1018
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:47,183
If they are doing thing well,

1019
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,727
why do I have to change someone?

1020
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:54,523
<i>When he warms up,
I go by the stripe and ask, "What?"</i>

1021
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:13,125
<i>That dialogue on the bench</i>

1022
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:15,753
<i>was me trying to convince him</i>

1023
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:18,673
<i>to be more daring.
"Think it through.</i>

1024
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,174
I have to come in as forward

1025
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,052
to score the goals
and win the game."

1026
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,513
"You know what?
I'd like it too

1027
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,765
if you came as center forward,
but right now,

1028
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,892
if I leave midfield,

1029
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:32,019
we're standing against
a very good team

1030
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:33,896
and we'll be in trouble."

1031
00:54:34,397 --> 00:54:35,856
"But keep warming up."

1032
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,817
I then decided
he wouldn't get in.

1033
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:41,153
He comes back five
or three minutes later

1034
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:43,114
and says, "Hugo won't play.

1035
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,032
Period."

1036
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:46,867
You enter as midfield
and move forward.

1037
00:54:47,243 --> 00:54:49,203
The player rules the field.

1038
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:51,080
"I'll enter midfield."
"Yes."

1039
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,832
"You go back, I go forward."

1040
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:56,127
But a center forward
was missing.

1041
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,129
I'm completely convinced.

1042
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:01,882
That's what the whole
country was clamoring.

1043
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:18,065
<i>The Mexicans said,
"Isabel, what's wrong?</i>

1044
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:20,568
<i>Tell Hugo to come out."
You know the Mexicans.</i>

1045
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:23,612
I was like, "What can I do?"

1046
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:25,698
"You tell him!
Sure you can."

1047
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:27,283
"Tell Miguel."

1048
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:31,287
<i>And, sadly, for many fans</i>

1049
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,497
and for the football world

1050
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:36,333
the only one who could decide

1051
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:37,710
at that time was I,
and I exerted that power.

1052
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:41,380
He didn't come out.

1053
00:55:42,173 --> 00:55:45,885
<i>It was one of the saddest episodes
in Mexican football,</i>

1054
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:49,346
{\an8}because we felt we had the man

1055
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:50,347
{\an8}that could take us

1056
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:55,436
{\an8}to the next desired round...

1057
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:03,569
{\an8}<i>Football generates, during games,</i>

1058
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:04,862
{\an8}<i>many scenarios.</i>

1059
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:07,156
One of the most important
it generates

1060
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,700
is what you can provoke
in your rival

1061
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:11,118
with the players you have.

1062
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:14,413
<i>Don't get the player in,
get his name in,</i>

1063
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:17,333
<i>and you disturb them.
That was the dilemma.</i>

1064
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:20,461
Maybe Miguel Mejia Baron
did it to take care of him.

1065
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,213
Who knows.

1066
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,340
<i>To bring Hugo in,</i>

1067
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,133
<i>as people think,</i>

1068
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:29,220
<i>just to kick a penalty</i>

1069
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:30,971
<i>is ridiculous.</i>

1070
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:32,681
<i>Not because he can't.</i>

1071
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,183
<i>Ridiculous</i>

1072
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:36,936
{\an8}<i>because he shot his last penalty</i>

1073
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:39,271
{\an8}<i>with his team Rayo Vallecano
and he failed,</i>

1074
00:56:39,355 --> 00:56:41,398
and his team went
to Second Division.

1075
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:42,942
That was his last penalty.

1076
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:45,694
I saw the Paraguay one,

1077
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:48,405
in '86.

1078
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:52,118
I lived the moment
when Hugo told Bora,

1079
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:53,244
"I have cramps against Germany."

1080
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:54,829
At that time,
everything came over me

1081
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:57,957
<i>and I thought,
"Why should I bring him in?"</i>

1082
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:02,753
<i>Such a big responsibility,
just to do that.</i>

1083
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:06,173
<i>I thought all those things
and said,</i>

1084
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:08,217
<i>"Not even for penalties."</i>

1085
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:09,844
I meant no disrespect.

1086
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,096
It was a coaching decision
in a given time.

1087
00:57:12,388 --> 00:57:14,723
<i>If he had wanted to come in,</i>

1088
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:17,977
<i>of course we would have won,
just for his presence.</i>

1089
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,480
Not because he'd have scored
three of four goals.

1090
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:24,233
Hugo's presence in the field,

1091
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:25,234
in the penalties,

1092
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:27,278
he would have been
the first shooter

1093
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:30,281
and we would have felt confident.

1094
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:31,532
Maybe...

1095
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:34,243
I should have seen before Miguel.

1096
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:37,580
He asked me if Hugo...

1097
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,874
I said, "It's unnecessary."

1098
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:42,126
<i>I didn't promise him anything.</i>

1099
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:44,211
<i>I had no obligations.</i>

1100
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:45,838
<i>He and I had obligations
as sportsmen</i>

1101
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:48,090
<i>that represented Mexico,
that's all.</i>

1102
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:50,426
There was nothing more.

1103
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:53,012
I didn't break any commitment.

1104
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,347
I'm not guilty of that.

1105
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,766
I would apologize

1106
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:01,812
in regards to
realizing now, as a coach,

1107
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:04,899
that my stance was wrong.

1108
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:06,650
As a coach.

1109
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:09,653
But a star and player,
undoubtedly,

1110
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:13,657
I think I wouldn't
have developed my qualities

1111
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,910
unless I played
where I always played.

1112
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:18,537
I loved him dearly.

1113
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:20,372
<i>Are you not friends anymore?</i>

1114
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:21,999
We're not friends.

1115
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:29,882
Yeah.

1116
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,718
It happens to everyone,
specially at my age.

1117
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,094
I'm sure it does.

1118
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,521
THE BEGINNING OF THE END 1997...

1119
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:46,982
<i>Hugo!</i>

1120
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:48,692
<i>Hugo!</i>

1121
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:50,611
<i>Hugo!</i>

1122
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:57,743
We'd all have liked
that he left at that great moment,

1123
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:58,744
but it's really hard.

1124
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:00,955
I think
everything football gives

1125
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,373
<i>makes it impossible</i>

1126
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:06,418
<i>to do it on time,
according to all of us</i>

1127
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:09,088
<i>who surround the empire
of sportsmen.</i>

1128
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:12,007
<i>I decided to retire</i>

1129
00:59:12,091 --> 00:59:15,219
<i>on May 29th, '97,</i>

1130
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:17,596
<i>in the tribute match
Real Madrid threw for me</i>

1131
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,266
<i>against Paris Saint Germain.</i>

1132
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:22,393
<i>Those were my last three flips</i>

1133
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,103
<i>my last three goals.</i>

1134
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:28,816
<i>He didn't train once in Real Madrid,</i>

1135
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:30,859
<i>not because he didn't want to train.</i>

1136
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,861
<i>Real Madrid was not doing well
in the League.</i>

1137
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,447
<i>Hugo said,
"The tribute is approaching.</i>

1138
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:38,492
<i>To train under pressure
with the team</i>

1139
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,577
<i>will only make me
distract them."</i>

1140
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:42,329
<i>It's incredible</i>

1141
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:43,998
<i>that he went to Majadahonda,</i>

1142
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,500
close to his home,
to run in the woods.

1143
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:50,170
And then he kicked
any amount of balls

1144
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:52,172
against two trees
that were the goal.

1145
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:55,009
And he refined his aim.

1146
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,468
<i>They took him everywhere</i>

1147
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:58,637
<i>in Madrid to give
midnight interviews</i>

1148
00:59:58,721 --> 01:00:00,764
<i>and the next day
he scored three goals.</i>

1149
01:00:00,848 --> 01:00:04,226
<i>The front cover reads,
"Real, there's your solution"</i>

1150
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,228
<i>Only Hugo Sanchez can do that.</i>

1151
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:10,316
<i>He scored in pregames</i>

1152
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:12,192
<i>two or three goals.</i>

1153
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:16,113
<i>All Michel and the midfielders
and above</i>

1154
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:19,158
were obsessed with was to try

1155
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:20,326
to make Hugo happy.

1156
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:21,493
What made Hugo happy?

1157
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:22,786
Scoring goals.

1158
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:27,833
<i>When I woke up that morning,</i>

1159
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:29,668
<i>with my bride by my side,</i>

1160
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:34,506
<i>I said, "I wouldn't have liked
to wake up</i>

1161
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:35,716
<i>from this beautiful dream."</i>

1162
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:53,609
<i>I didn't really realized
what he was going through.</i>

1163
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:55,277
<i>He was just like now.</i>

1164
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:56,862
<i>It was the same effect.</i>

1165
01:00:56,945 --> 01:01:00,032
For the rest of the civilization,
it was the same.

1166
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:03,660
For me, I realized
it was obviously a hard time.

1167
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:05,829
A little bit of the nose,

1168
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:07,748
those big, beautiful eyes,

1169
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,500
the big eyelashes
and the eyebrows.

1170
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,627
- The mouth.
- Not the mouth.

1171
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:13,587
You don't want my mouth?

1172
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:15,547
<i>He keeps everything inside.</i>

1173
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:21,095
I think he doesn't want
to share his sadness

1174
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:25,224
or his fears with others,

1175
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:30,562
I mean, with his closest
family members, because

1176
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:33,607
he prefers, somehow,

1177
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,985
to suffer on his own
and his pain to others,

1178
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:42,741
like when he shares
that suffering with us.

1179
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:45,035
I mean,

1180
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:49,039
the time I saw him
suffer the most

1181
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:51,500
was when my brother Hugo died.

1182
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:54,253
It was very sad.

1183
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:58,257
My wife, my daughters
and I got ready

1184
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:01,718
to take a flight from Tijuana

1185
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:04,221
to Mexico City.

1186
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:06,265
And suddenly

1187
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:08,392
my wife's phone rang,

1188
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,144
because I turned my phone off,

1189
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:12,896
because we had boarded the plane,

1190
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:17,651
and my wife didn't turn it off.

1191
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:21,405
The call came in

1192
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:26,785
and it was my manager's wife,
Jose Manuel Sanz.

1193
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:29,788
She has my wife's number
and called her.

1194
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:33,208
She said, "We are calling Hugo
and he doesn't answer.

1195
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:36,128
But I call you
because we need to find him."

1196
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:38,881
"We're on the plane to Mexico City.

1197
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:42,134
We'll make a stop to go to Pachuca,
for the Hall of Fame."

1198
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:45,053
She says,
"Jose Manuel wants to talk to Hugo,

1199
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:46,346
can you give him the phone?"

1200
01:02:46,472 --> 01:02:48,182
So she gave me the phone.

1201
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:55,731
It was on that damn
November 8th, 2014,

1202
01:02:56,607 --> 01:02:59,443
when Jose Manuel told me

1203
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:01,403
that they...

1204
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:04,781
They informed him that

1205
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:07,075
they had found two bodies

1206
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:08,660
in Polanco

1207
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:11,455
and it seemed like
one of them was Hugo.

1208
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:14,583
So I was paralyzed and...

1209
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:33,060
I couldn't speak.

1210
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:40,442
Isabel asked, "What happened?"

1211
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,152
I said,

1212
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:47,449
"They told me it's possible
that Hugo

1213
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:53,580
is one of the bodies
they found in Polanco,

1214
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:56,124
but it's not confirmed yet."

1215
01:03:57,626 --> 01:03:58,794
So

1216
01:03:59,628 --> 01:04:00,921
I was speechless.

1217
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:09,805
They...

1218
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:13,433
Isabel, my wife,

1219
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:15,978
and my daughters in the next seats,

1220
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:19,523
didn't know what was going on.

1221
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:22,776
So I told Isabel,

1222
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:27,030
"It's not confirmed,
but it might be."

1223
01:04:27,823 --> 01:04:29,908
I couldn't hold myself.

1224
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:34,037
That was the most

1225
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,748
fucked up flight...

1226
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:45,007
I've ever taken.

1227
01:04:47,259 --> 01:04:48,176
That one.

1228
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:53,098
A three goddamn hour journey

1229
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:54,808
to Mexico...

1230
01:04:56,018 --> 01:04:57,561
From Tijuana to Mexico.

1231
01:05:00,772 --> 01:05:02,149
And I spent

1232
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:05,902
the whole trip crying,

1233
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:07,946
my wife too,

1234
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:12,868
and thus my daughters.
They couldn't believe it.

1235
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:17,497
I arrived to the airport

1236
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,167
and the first thing I did...

1237
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,924
was pick up the phone,

1238
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:30,344
call Jose Manuel

1239
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,180
and ask him to please investigate

1240
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:34,765
while I was in the flight,

1241
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:35,891
to investigate,

1242
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:37,893
and please confirm

1243
01:05:38,727 --> 01:05:39,978
if it was Hugo or not.

1244
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,981
So I arrived to the airport,

1245
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:47,986
descended the escalator,

1246
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:50,906
which I'll never forget,

1247
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:52,783
it seemed eternal.

1248
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:55,619
I went to the men's

1249
01:05:57,412 --> 01:06:01,667
room, and my wife
and my daughters went

1250
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:03,835
to the women's room,

1251
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:05,796
and when I called Jose Manuel,

1252
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:08,757
he confirmed

1253
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:10,425
that it was him.

1254
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:15,138
I wanted to leave before.

1255
01:06:15,681 --> 01:06:17,391
The normal thing is...

1256
01:06:18,225 --> 01:06:19,976
that grandparents leave first,

1257
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:21,561
then the parents

1258
01:06:22,688 --> 01:06:23,939
and then the children.

1259
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:28,902
But I don't understand
why he left first.

1260
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:31,071
I wanted to go before him.

1261
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:33,824
That's it.

1262
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,242
When I knew that...

1263
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:38,829
my life

1264
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:40,539
has been another.

1265
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:47,087
It's not the same.

1266
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:03,937
<i>God...</i>

1267
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:06,815
<i>God has supported me
in everything.</i>

1268
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:10,610
<i>And I accept fate.</i>

1269
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:23,165
Every time I see my dad

1270
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:27,836
I feel my brother close.

1271
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:50,358
{\an8}I don't know why Mexico
doesn't have

1272
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:52,444
{\an8}forwards up to par
with Hugo Sanchez.

1273
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:54,696
{\an8}Forwards like Hugo Sanchez

1274
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,990
{\an8}don't exist anywhere in the world.

1275
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:03,330
<i>Nowadays, societies' new gods,</i>

1276
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,540
<i>as in ancient times,
in the Roman Empire,</i>

1277
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:07,083
<i>were warriors.</i>

1278
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:09,002
<i>They are football players,</i>

1279
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:10,921
<i>the sportsmen</i>

1280
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:13,298
<i>the nations' ambassadors,</i>

1281
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:14,758
<i>the characters that</i>

1282
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,344
<i>can easily be more recognized
than a president.</i>

1283
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:19,763
<i>And that's what happened
with Hugo Sanchez.</i>

1284
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:20,764
<i>He became an ambassador</i>

1285
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:23,099
<i>where everyone in the world
know who he is.</i>

1286
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:28,980
<i>Hugo started to turn</i>

1287
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:31,858
<i>Mexican football
into globalized football.</i>

1288
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:36,238
<i>He helped give Mexico
an important type of identity,</i>

1289
01:08:36,404 --> 01:08:39,324
<i>as an exporter of Mexican culture.</i>

1290
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:44,871
<i>I pictured myself
being Hugo Sanchez,</i>

1291
01:08:44,955 --> 01:08:46,248
<i>playing in Europe too.</i>

1292
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:50,669
<i>If back then Hugo Sanchez</i>

1293
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:52,170
hadn't been there,

1294
01:08:52,254 --> 01:08:53,964
{\an8}I wouldn't have had
anyone to look up to

1295
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:56,758
{\an8}and have that dream.

1296
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:00,679
<i>Hugo should be next to Cantinflas,</i>

1297
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:02,639
<i>with Pedro Infante.</i>

1298
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:03,974
<i>It's a popular matter.</i>

1299
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:06,226
Hugo Sanchez doesn't belong to himself.

1300
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,812
{\an8}Hugo Sanchez is society's heritage.

1301
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:11,606
{\an8}Whether you like him or not,
he's Mexico's heritage.

1302
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:16,736
<i>Whoever thinks it's easy
that the master Hugo Sanchez</i>

1303
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,697
<i>was five times Pichichi,</i>

1304
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:22,576
<i>lifted Pumas up to be a champion</i>

1305
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:24,828
<i>two seasons in a row,</i>

1306
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:27,247
<i>that he made all those guys
that spread hate</i>

1307
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,291
<i>eat their own words</i>

1308
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:31,042
<i>when he played in Atletico,</i>

1309
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:34,337
<i>that he made Real Madrid champion</i>

1310
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:35,422
<i>who knows how many times,</i>

1311
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,966
{\an8}it seems easy,

1312
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:40,927
{\an8}but only the Indian

1313
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,513
{\an8}knows the weight he carries.

1314
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,182
{\an8}I'm very lucky to have been

1315
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:48,852
{\an8}exactly in the same field,
kicking the same ball

1316
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:50,729
{\an8}and sometimes
defending the same team

1317
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:54,149
{\an8}with the greatest guy
that Mexican football gave us.

1318
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:04,367
{\an8}What would I say
if we played together?

1319
01:10:06,161 --> 01:10:07,913
{\an8}"Make a pass
to score a goal."

1320
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:12,042
No.
For me, obviously,

1321
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:15,253
I love to play with top players,
and Hugo Sanchez

1322
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:18,590
was in the top, a legend
and I'd be proud

1323
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:19,799
and I'd love to play with him,

1324
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:22,802
because good players
must play together.

1325
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:25,555
The cracks,
the legends must play together.

1326
01:10:25,639 --> 01:10:28,099
What I said is not a dream,

1327
01:10:28,183 --> 01:10:31,269
it's the truth. It would be
a pleasure to play with him

1328
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:35,231
and we'd surely make a top duo.

1329
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:41,988
<i>I'm grateful to Sanchez</i>

1330
01:10:42,197 --> 01:10:44,866
<i>because he has made me
feel proud</i>

1331
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:46,534
<i>as the Mexican I am.</i>

1332
01:10:46,618 --> 01:10:49,704
<i>For everything that Hugo Sanchez
has represented to us</i>

1333
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:52,499
<i>and everything he's given to Mexico.</i>

1334
01:10:52,624 --> 01:10:55,335
Despite everyone.

1335
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:58,546
<i>Without Hugo Sanchez
football would be different.</i>

1336
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:00,548
<i>I can agree or not.</i>

1337
01:11:00,632 --> 01:11:03,385
<i>He might be arrogant or not.</i>

1338
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,428
<i>Whatever he is.</i>

1339
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:07,555
He is a necessary guy.

1340
01:11:07,639 --> 01:11:09,516
A guy that football needed

1341
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,393
and I think we enjoyed him a lot.

1342
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:15,563
<i>When you start in football</i>

1343
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:17,065
or want to become someone,

1344
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:19,526
there's no better example
than Hugo Sanchez,

1345
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,612
Mexican, triumphant, scorer.

1346
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:26,032
{\an8}Everything he achieved in Europe

1347
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:27,826
{\an8}is something

1348
01:11:28,535 --> 01:11:30,036
{\an8}not anyone can reach.

1349
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:33,915
<i>Due to the magnitude
of Hugo Sanchez' figure</i>

1350
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:38,003
<i>and all he planted
in the collective unconscious</i>

1351
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:41,339
<i>we will always expect
that what Hugo Sanchez does</i>

1352
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:44,801
<i>in any walk of life
is triumphant.</i>

1353
01:11:45,427 --> 01:11:46,970
That's not Hugo's fault.

1354
01:11:47,846 --> 01:11:49,431
Our expectations.

1355
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:55,478
<i>Hugo Sanchez is a character
in Mexican history,</i>

1356
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:56,938
<i>not football only.</i>

1357
01:11:57,022 --> 01:11:58,440
I think Hugo transcended

1358
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:00,358
beyond our borders

1359
01:12:00,442 --> 01:12:02,402
and Hugo is a Mexican icon.

1360
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:07,282
<i>Despite that
many things have happened</i>

1361
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:08,658
<i>and many years have passed</i>

1362
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,535
<i>since his days in the field,</i>

1363
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:13,955
the Mexican boy
that wants to be a football player

1364
01:12:14,122 --> 01:12:16,291
still identifies with Hugo Sanchez.

1365
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:27,719
<i>When I was a child,</i>

1366
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:32,307
<i>maybe I was 4 or 5,</i>

1367
01:12:33,058 --> 01:12:35,560
<i>I came to my house
from the street,</i>

1368
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:38,646
<i>one Saturday,
and my father was with his friends</i>

1369
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:39,689
<i>playing domino,</i>

1370
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:44,486
<i>and when I came in,
he sat me on his lap</i>

1371
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:46,654
<i>and asked his buddies,
"Do you know who this child is?</i>

1372
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:49,824
This boy will be
the best football player

1373
01:12:49,908 --> 01:12:51,493
of all time in Mexico".

1374
01:13:03,797 --> 01:13:05,256
HUGO SANCHEZ
STARTED HIS TRAJECTORY

1375
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:06,424
AS A COACH IN THE YEAR 2000.

1376
01:13:06,508 --> 01:13:07,801
IN THE YEAR 2004, HE ACHIEVED
THE DOUBLE CHAMPIONSHIP WITH UNAM

1377
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:09,094
AND GOT THE TITLE
SANTIAGO BERNABEU.

1378
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:10,345
IN THE YEAR 2006
HE TOOK THE REINS

1379
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:11,763
OF MEXICO'S NATIONAL
FOOTBALL TEAM

1380
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:12,639
FOR ONLY 13 MONTHS

1381
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,182
PLACING THIRD
IN THE AMERICAN CUP.

1382
01:13:14,516 --> 01:13:15,183
HE CURRENTLY WORKS
