1
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:05,322
Now, don't you say a word.

2
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:09,131
No matter what the employees say,

3
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,828
don't apologize,

4
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:14,938
or make excuses.

5
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:22,773
This is harder for you
than it is for them.

6
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:26,512
Don't mistake that.

7
00:01:37,168 --> 00:01:38,693
- Good morning.
- Yes.

8
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:40,263
Good morning.

9
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:42,907
Attention!

10
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:48,348
I'm Murakami, business consultant.

11
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:52,400
For this company to survive,

12
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:56,312
we will hire an accounting agency.

13
00:01:56,853 --> 00:02:02,110
It is unavoidable to ask you all
to leave this company.

14
00:02:03,885 --> 00:02:08,255
Pay check and
arrangements for insurance...

15
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:11,586
will be made later.

16
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:23,182
What is this?

17
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:28,703
We know it's a difficult time.

18
00:02:28,963 --> 00:02:33,910
But why 'it's the consultant
to tell us?

19
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:37,480
Instead of you?

20
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:40,885
We've work for you
all this time together.

21
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:47,159
Huh? Say something!

22
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:52,030
Satchan, let's go.

23
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:57,670
- Come on.
- Wait!

24
00:02:57,942 --> 00:02:59,877
He betrayed us.

25
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:01,875
Don't say that.

26
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:04,708
Ayako, come.
- Coming.

27
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:06,739
Ayako, well.

28
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,472
Good morning, gentlemen.

29
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:45,566
Thank you for coming here
all the long way so early.

30
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:48,826
President has a message.

31
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:04,065
Gentlemen here today are all over 50.

32
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:07,370
You are all in responsible posts...

33
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:14,659
and your effort made this company
what it is today.

34
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:21,687
However,
in the midst of this recession,

35
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:24,988
business are closing.
Even large companies.

36
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:31,629
For our survival, we need to carry out
a major restructuring.

37
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:44,109
The board decided to request you all
to voluntarily step down.

38
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:48,123
This decision was difficult.

39
00:04:48,974 --> 00:04:56,211
But this is the only way to survive.

40
00:04:56,591 --> 00:05:00,494
We ask for your understanding.

41
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:08,341
If you accept and step down, we will
provide additional compensation pay.

42
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:12,667
If you do not accept,
you are welcome to stay.

43
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:18,076
But your post will be outside duty.

44
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:22,947
Please decide by the end of May.

45
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:26,217
The human resources manager
will give you more information later.

46
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:28,751
Thank you.

47
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,892
Stop passing the buck!

48
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,031
Yeah!

49
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:53,942
"Six months later"

50
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,893
April 6th, rain, later clouds.

51
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:11,318
Mom's starting school.

52
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:18,098
Mon in her white clothes,
dressed pretty to school.

53
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:44,600
Now, everyone, introduce yourself.

54
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:46,629
Hashimoto.

55
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:53,944
I worked 35 years
in an insurance company.

56
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:57,551
2 years to retirement,

57
00:07:57,674 --> 00:08:01,338
but they made me step down.

58
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:02,841
So I'm here.

59
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:10,009
I ran a factory in Arakawa,
doing sheet metal work.

60
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:13,419
Business failed
and closed last spring.

61
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,025
So I'm here to start over again.

62
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,225
I ran a bar,

63
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:24,392
price became business over quality.

64
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:27,127
Banks refused to lend,

65
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:32,036
eventually I ran out of money,
so I quit.

66
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:40,364
Studying at my age is hard,
but I'll try my best.

67
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:46,976
My name is Kim Yong Su.
Okay to call me Kim.

68
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,888
I ran a small store
selling electronics,

69
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,803
then a large store opened nearby.

70
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:53,488
Business turned bad and...

71
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:56,513
I had to close my store.

72
00:08:56,938 --> 00:08:58,804
I live with my grandmother...

73
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,920
but her pension isn't enough.
So I'm here.

74
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:06,873
Now the only lady here, Kojima.

75
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:12,939
I'm Kojima. Only lady here.

76
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:18,412
The interviewer said
physical work maybe hard,

77
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,713
but I'm quite strong.

78
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:27,524
I'll try to do as well as you all
for next six months.

79
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,890
Takano.

80
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:33,161
My name is Takano.

81
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:36,333
Hata.

82
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,170
I'm Hata.

83
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:42,043
Parent company cut cost,

84
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:45,808
which hit us and I had to leave.

85
00:09:46,164 --> 00:09:47,496
So I'm here.

86
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:55,485
Rain stopped later.

87
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:58,961
I hate rain.

88
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:03,895
Because the newspapers will get wet.

89
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:10,100
Hanzomon, Hibiya, Marunouchi.

90
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:14,140
Do subway have tunnels?

91
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:21,149
North or south hemisphere?

92
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:39,258
Behave!

93
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:40,828
Tommy, are you okay?

94
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:51,311
I told you,

95
00:10:51,648 --> 00:10:53,776
not to ride in the middle.

96
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:55,282
I didn't.

97
00:10:55,485 --> 00:10:56,453
Okay?

98
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:13,961
Aunt, Tommy fell from the bicycle.

99
00:11:14,171 --> 00:11:15,104
Again?

100
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:16,671
We delivered the newspapers together.

101
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,338
Thank you.

102
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:20,937
Take your bicycle.

103
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:23,781
Ken, stay for dinner.

104
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:26,110
I have class. Gotta go.

105
00:11:26,316 --> 00:11:27,944
Say "hi" to mom for me.

106
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:37,456
Are there tunnels in Paris?

107
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:38,661
Special dishes today.

108
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:45,296
"Itadakimasu"?

109
00:11:46,136 --> 00:11:47,502
Itadakimasu.

110
00:11:47,738 --> 00:11:49,707
You could always say it.

111
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:59,461
Remember Tommy?

112
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,977
Mom is going to school tomorrow.

113
00:12:02,162 --> 00:12:05,360
You have to eat breakfast on your own.

114
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:06,737
My own.

115
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,088
Yes. Kobayashi will come at 10...

116
00:12:10,293 --> 00:12:12,091
to take you.

117
00:12:14,998 --> 00:12:17,297
Mom will come home at 5.

118
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:18,867
Come home at 5?

119
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:26,585
Toast for school! Cheers.

120
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,676
Cheers.

121
00:12:34,217 --> 00:12:44,216
Tasty? Look this is textbook
for studying. Very hard.

122
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,498
Is boiler English?

123
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,426
Yes.

124
00:12:52,753 --> 00:12:55,052
Why written in Katakana?

125
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:57,679
Maybe Americans can't read Kanji.

126
00:12:58,429 --> 00:12:59,658
Itadakimasu.

127
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:03,909
- Yes?
- It's me.

128
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:05,382
Oh hi.

129
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:13,047
Hi Tommy. Dinner done?

130
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:14,807
- Done.
- Not yet.

131
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:17,027
Good. I brought some Tempura.

132
00:13:17,227 --> 00:13:18,195
Yes.

133
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:25,267
Looks delicious. Thanks.

134
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:28,147
How was school?

135
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:32,769
Never thought I'd go back at this age.

136
00:13:33,476 --> 00:13:37,777
All the pains. One after another.

137
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:42,653
I'll probably get by like always.

138
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:43,884
Come in.

139
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:47,081
No I can't. Good luck.

140
00:13:47,324 --> 00:13:48,383
Thanks.

141
00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:54,894
No sauce, no mayonnaise.

142
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:01,032
Tasty?

143
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:09,276
I'm not young,

144
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:12,848
I don't need anything fancy.

145
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:17,612
Just a secure job,
with stable employment.

146
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:21,417
Not part-time,
not temporary, full time.

147
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:28,689
Just enough money for me and my son,
to make living,

148
00:14:29,165 --> 00:14:32,260
I take hard work.

149
00:14:32,802 --> 00:14:36,170
Those jobs, up there...

150
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:39,400
cleaning job for woman over 45,

151
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:43,846
all part-time or temp.

152
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:48,851
I need security. Help me.

153
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:53,331
What about vocational schools?

154
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,656
Vocational schools?

155
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:58,926
If you finish the degree,

156
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:01,457
offers better chance.

157
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:07,699
How much does it cost? Expensive?

158
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:09,271
It's free.

159
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:12,302
And with allowances.

160
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:28,377
Here is a building.

161
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:30,737
Sorry for my bad drawing.

162
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,032
Before, most of you worked in...

163
00:15:33,363 --> 00:15:39,325
this section of the building.

164
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:43,754
When you graduate...

165
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:49,578
and work in a building,
this section,

166
00:15:50,313 --> 00:15:57,015
where the big boilers and
transformers are,

167
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,087
will be the section where you work.

168
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:05,310
Remember that you're not...

169
00:16:05,695 --> 00:16:10,030
in offices with ties,
it's different.

170
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:14,877
You get paid much less,
maybe half or even a third.

171
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:22,202
Takano,
please change your clothes.

172
00:16:23,013 --> 00:16:25,039
My clothes?

173
00:16:25,837 --> 00:16:28,602
As I have said before,

174
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:31,152
you will be working in...

175
00:16:31,321 --> 00:16:32,550
Fine.

176
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:44,025
Maintenance is literally the base.

177
00:16:44,947 --> 00:16:47,610
As you study this course,

178
00:16:47,784 --> 00:16:50,515
tell yourself that you support...

179
00:16:50,673 --> 00:16:55,543
the safety of building
and its people.

180
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:58,645
You are older,

181
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:02,307
your memory maybe half or a third,

182
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:05,989
you have to work harder.

183
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:07,919
It's hard...

184
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:11,423
but do your best
and finish this course.

185
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:20,097
I'll do it.

186
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:22,863
Let me, I like serving.

187
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,673
Terrible tea.

188
00:17:24,908 --> 00:17:27,673
I'll bring better tea.

189
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:34,277
- Some tea?
- No thanks.

190
00:17:39,996 --> 00:17:47,635
This is fire tube boiler.

191
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:51,962
Currently most common type of boiler.

192
00:17:52,502 --> 00:17:55,495
This one uses gas
but crude oil is common.

193
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,399
Now, we will use this boiler for class.

194
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:02,405
This is the tiling classroom.

195
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:22,588
In here, we learn
about electricity.

196
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,669
Building's transformers and boilers,

197
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:31,499
freezers, and operation of
automatic controllers.

198
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:44,629
Tomorrow,
class schedule will start.

199
00:18:45,028 --> 00:18:49,134
There is a lot to learn
in a very limited time,

200
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:51,691
so please prepare for class.

201
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:54,730
Class dismissed.

202
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,280
Takano,

203
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:13,781
we are deciding...

204
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:15,781
our turns for cleaning,

205
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,342
can you stay while we decide?

206
00:19:17,554 --> 00:19:21,616
Cleaning? Why do I have to?

207
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:26,494
Why? Because it's our classroom.

208
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:29,530
Go ahead. I have plans.

209
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:33,669
It will only be a few minutes.

210
00:19:43,346 --> 00:19:45,110
Finance section?

211
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:50,520
I'm Takano, Arai manager's friend.

212
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:53,253
Is he in?

213
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:56,287
What time will he return?

214
00:19:56,993 --> 00:20:00,896
Okay. I'll call later.

215
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,962
Tell him I called.

216
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:19,246
Say, that Takano,

217
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:23,572
he probably used to boss around.

218
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:27,685
And a lot of money at retirement.

219
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:30,527
It's open.

220
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:32,715
Let's go for a beer.

221
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,599
I have to cook for my son.

222
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:38,462
Then, Kim.

223
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:39,894
I can't drink.

224
00:20:40,236 --> 00:20:43,798
Come on. Take care.

225
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:46,981
- Thanks.
- Bye.

226
00:20:47,153 --> 00:20:48,485
Bye.

227
00:21:58,748 --> 00:21:59,681
Ouch!

228
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:12,928
In the middle, always telling you.

229
00:22:15,264 --> 00:22:20,328
Don't run in the middle, keep left.

230
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:27,704
Left side of the road.

231
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:32,246
You have to cooperate.

232
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:34,747
Cooperate or it's autism.

233
00:22:35,118 --> 00:22:38,282
Have to cooperate.

234
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:42,016
If not, it's autism.

235
00:22:42,325 --> 00:22:45,625
If autism, it's dreadful.

236
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:50,024
Have to cooperate.

237
00:22:50,366 --> 00:22:51,834
Behaving, behaving.

238
00:22:52,135 --> 00:22:55,367
Behaving, behaving.

239
00:23:02,345 --> 00:23:04,746
Are there tunnels in Argentina?

240
00:23:04,914 --> 00:23:06,109
How many tunnels?

241
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:08,250
Are there tunnels in Brazil?

242
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,787
How many tunnels in Columbia?

243
00:23:15,224 --> 00:23:19,161
In a long tunnel. In a long tunnel.

244
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:26,558
Hello?

245
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,885
Tommy just came back.

246
00:23:30,072 --> 00:23:31,904
Wet from rain,

247
00:23:32,186 --> 00:23:34,018
taking a bath now.

248
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:39,642
Old newspapers? What?

249
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:43,794
I'll be right there.

250
00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:54,157
Tommy did something again.

251
00:23:55,498 --> 00:23:59,367
Tommy, I'll be out. Be right back.

252
00:24:02,238 --> 00:24:05,868
Phone doesn't stop,
20, 30 so many calls,

253
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:10,994
they're really upset
about old newspapers.

254
00:24:11,854 --> 00:24:17,371
Big trouble. We're redelivering.

255
00:24:18,387 --> 00:24:21,983
Yamamoto, leave that, go now!

256
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,622
What to do?

257
00:24:26,028 --> 00:24:28,463
I'll go and apologize.

258
00:24:29,165 --> 00:24:31,361
- What?
- Let me.

259
00:24:39,886 --> 00:24:42,606
Excuse me. Yomiuri Shimbun.

260
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:46,201
My son delivered old newspaper
by mistake.

261
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:48,618
I'm really sorry.

262
00:24:53,047 --> 00:24:54,174
Who is it?

263
00:24:54,587 --> 00:24:57,557
Excuse me. My name is Kojima,

264
00:24:57,724 --> 00:24:59,955
my son delivered old newspaper
by mistake.

265
00:25:00,121 --> 00:25:03,683
I brought new newspaper.

266
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,529
Leave it in.

267
00:25:05,768 --> 00:25:07,737
I'm very sorry.

268
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:23,781
Excuse me. I'm Kojima,

269
00:25:23,895 --> 00:25:27,229
my son delivered old newspaper
by mistake.

270
00:25:27,523 --> 00:25:29,185
I'm very sorry.

271
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:31,384
I'll tell him not to.

272
00:25:31,627 --> 00:25:33,152
Your son?

273
00:25:33,396 --> 00:25:35,661
That mumbling boy?

274
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:39,032
He's handicapped.

275
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:42,228
He scares my kid,

276
00:25:42,438 --> 00:25:46,273
disturbs his study.

277
00:25:47,352 --> 00:25:51,171
Does he have to work?

278
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,940
He can go to institutions, can't he?

279
00:25:55,613 --> 00:25:59,573
Yes, but he wants to work.

280
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:03,377
He is treasured at work,

281
00:26:03,593 --> 00:26:05,494
worked over a year.

282
00:26:06,155 --> 00:26:12,821
I will tell him to keep
his mumbling down.

283
00:26:35,591 --> 00:26:37,492
Sorry.

284
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:46,231
Why no poop? No poop.

285
00:26:46,535 --> 00:26:49,095
Try, no poop.

286
00:26:50,506 --> 00:26:53,340
When will I poop?

287
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:57,310
After dinner. You can poop.

288
00:26:58,114 --> 00:27:02,074
If no poop comes, what will happen?

289
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:04,150
Then have milk.

290
00:27:05,087 --> 00:27:14,862
Have milk. Will I go poop?

291
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:22,798
Why? Tommy just did
what he thought was best.

292
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:25,942
Don't deliver wet newspapers.

293
00:27:26,342 --> 00:27:31,076
Why do people say things like that?

294
00:27:35,184 --> 00:27:37,517
In such a mean way?

295
00:27:39,488 --> 00:27:47,191
Like this child is no good
for this world?

296
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:54,903
Eat, then big poop?

297
00:27:57,274 --> 00:28:00,438
Lots.

298
00:28:11,372 --> 00:28:17,362
"Correct reason,
for setting the major axis...

299
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:21,211
of elliptical manhol
in direction of...

300
00:28:21,555 --> 00:28:23,956
the boiler tube circumference."

301
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:28,419
This is a common exam question.

302
00:28:28,586 --> 00:28:32,284
Any one? Hashimoto.

303
00:28:33,142 --> 00:28:36,271
Stress to the circumference...

304
00:28:36,445 --> 00:28:40,849
is double to that of axis.
Therefore it's safer.

305
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,416
Question?

306
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:45,387
What's "stress"? Is it pressure?

307
00:28:45,554 --> 00:28:47,489
Back in page 39.

308
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:52,215
Power to pull and bend things
with pressure.

309
00:28:52,528 --> 00:28:56,226
Wrong units. "cm2", and "mm2".

310
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,830
Just remember "stress".

311
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:02,538
Now, on the types of tubes.

312
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:09,182
There are 5 types
chosen depending on the use.

313
00:29:10,012 --> 00:29:14,677
Exam question. Kojima.

314
00:29:15,117 --> 00:29:16,141
Yes.

315
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,670
Read?

316
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:25,669
"Smoking pipe".

317
00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:33,001
I first thought so too.

318
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:36,000
It didn't make sense.

319
00:29:36,372 --> 00:29:37,704
It means "fire tube" here.

320
00:29:37,873 --> 00:29:42,777
These are in the boiler water...

321
00:29:43,112 --> 00:29:45,240
filled with gas.

322
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:50,078
Water tube. Water is inside,

323
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:52,820
combustible gas is outside,

324
00:29:53,222 --> 00:29:55,418
used in water tube boilers.

325
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,298
Hello? Finance section?

326
00:30:02,498 --> 00:30:05,127
Is Arai manager in?

327
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:09,099
I'm a friend of his. Takano.

328
00:30:09,338 --> 00:30:12,536
Is he in? Thank you.

329
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:19,211
It's me, Takano.

330
00:30:19,412 --> 00:30:21,472
Sorry, I called many times.

331
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:24,683
You busy?

332
00:30:26,211 --> 00:30:29,803
Did you talk to the president of
Marui Securities?

333
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:37,713
What? What about my age?

334
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:42,528
Before, you said it was okay.
Why now it is a problem?

335
00:30:42,771 --> 00:30:47,835
You should have told me earlier.

336
00:30:48,844 --> 00:30:52,144
Arai, can we meet for a minute?

337
00:30:52,348 --> 00:30:55,512
I know you're busy, just a few...

338
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:57,977
Hello?

339
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,835
Wow!

340
00:31:54,443 --> 00:31:58,141
Takano. Are you there?

341
00:31:58,514 --> 00:32:00,813
I just saw him walking out.

342
00:32:00,983 --> 00:32:05,250
It's his turn to clean today.
Does he know?

343
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:16,123
Hello? Is Arai manager there?

344
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:23,231
I called several times,
Takano, a friend from school,

345
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,036
In meeting...

346
00:32:26,675 --> 00:32:32,478
Please, it's quite urgent,
can you...?

347
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:37,010
You can't. Fine.

348
00:32:38,078 --> 00:32:40,673
Tell him that...

349
00:32:40,956 --> 00:32:45,985
Takano will never call again!
Thanks!

350
00:32:54,163 --> 00:32:55,487
Takano.

351
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:00,848
It's your turn to clean today.
You forgot?

352
00:33:02,044 --> 00:33:03,945
I had plans.

353
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:08,454
Why didn't you tell us then?

354
00:33:08,617 --> 00:33:11,416
"Self-ism" is not good.

355
00:33:11,994 --> 00:33:15,633
Such word doesn't exist.

356
00:33:16,091 --> 00:33:18,458
Can't you talk nicely?

357
00:33:18,727 --> 00:33:20,525
Why don't you mix with the others?

358
00:33:21,528 --> 00:33:23,758
Why should I?

359
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:25,128
No rule.

360
00:33:25,434 --> 00:33:27,062
Unpleasant guy.

361
00:33:29,547 --> 00:33:32,439
We don't care if you don't,

362
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:35,510
but don't disturb others.

363
00:33:35,811 --> 00:33:38,178
When we were complaining,

364
00:33:38,414 --> 00:33:44,376
Kojima said
she will clean on your behalf.

365
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,851
Go thank her.

366
00:33:47,189 --> 00:33:48,487
Let's go now.

367
00:34:00,936 --> 00:34:07,274
I cannot forget, I love him.

368
00:34:07,576 --> 00:34:09,306
Old song.

369
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:13,245
Reminds me of good times.
I had my love.

370
00:34:13,482 --> 00:34:15,007
Really?

371
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:17,686
I'm very sorry. I will do it.

372
00:34:20,466 --> 00:34:22,684
Don't worry.

373
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:24,588
Can you do it?

374
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:25,988
No problem.

375
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:33,636
Wait, wait!

376
00:34:33,926 --> 00:34:37,522
Look. Wash inside first,
then squeeze.

377
00:34:41,742 --> 00:34:43,768
Not so hard!

378
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:49,011
Give me that. Like this.

379
00:34:49,284 --> 00:34:56,020
Step on the pedal,
then squeeze by gradually releasing.

380
00:35:04,351 --> 00:35:08,582
Takano, take off your jacket.

381
00:35:09,571 --> 00:35:10,630
Right.

382
00:35:17,634 --> 00:35:21,766
Roll up your pants. It's wet.

383
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:34,357
Right. And my sleeves.

384
00:35:49,311 --> 00:35:51,871
- Right.
- Rough.

385
00:35:55,909 --> 00:35:58,140
Leave it to me.

386
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:01,285
Thank you.

387
00:36:09,665 --> 00:36:12,396
Know where to put the mop?

388
00:36:12,534 --> 00:36:14,662
Yes.

389
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,131
Next to the toilet.

390
00:36:16,438 --> 00:36:17,667
Goodbye.

391
00:36:34,056 --> 00:36:37,424
That guy is just selfish.

392
00:36:37,593 --> 00:36:40,324
Common guy nature.

393
00:36:40,529 --> 00:36:43,897
Wonder what his wife is like...

394
00:36:44,366 --> 00:36:48,394
Jerks like him
often have beautiful wives.

395
00:36:49,204 --> 00:36:50,797
Dumb women.

396
00:37:12,768 --> 00:37:15,567
Yamazaki Metal 930 yen,
buy 20 million.

397
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,522
Got it.

398
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,114
Turn out Yamazaki Metal,
sell two million.

399
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:19,437
803 yen. Sold?

400
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:20,891
Barge is strong.

401
00:37:21,236 --> 00:37:21,862
Sell.

402
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,630
Meeting at 6?

403
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,806
Sold? Thanks.

404
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:09,795
Sawako Kojima.

405
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:23,695
"Common exam question."

406
00:38:40,103 --> 00:38:41,537
You came?

407
00:38:42,084 --> 00:38:44,815
You told me to.

408
00:38:44,986 --> 00:38:46,420
How?

409
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:51,993
On bicycle.

410
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:01,429
How's mom?

411
00:39:03,672 --> 00:39:07,404
Bad business, bad mood.

412
00:39:07,876 --> 00:39:11,438
You hungry? Eat.

413
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,976
You're eating this? Pitiful.

414
00:39:24,092 --> 00:39:27,529
Nagashima manager has 7 pitchers...

415
00:39:27,729 --> 00:39:31,962
Dad, you remember
Nagashima playing?

416
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:35,934
Yeah, went to see his games.

417
00:39:36,204 --> 00:39:38,764
Remember when he quit?

418
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:43,642
I was 26.
I became manager that year,

419
00:39:43,812 --> 00:39:47,249
so I remember clearly.

420
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:48,881
Wanna drink?

421
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:50,647
Underage.

422
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:51,718
He hits! To the left field!

423
00:39:51,887 --> 00:39:53,219
He hit!

424
00:39:53,522 --> 00:39:55,423
Big one to left, but... stopped!

425
00:39:55,857 --> 00:39:57,189
What!

426
00:39:57,491 --> 00:40:01,490
Hajime, that freshman year,

427
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,526
you said you want to become a chef.

428
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:05,501
Yeah.

429
00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:09,901
I said, you should go to college
no matter what,

430
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:14,769
and you cried in fury.

431
00:40:15,903 --> 00:40:17,633
Uh-huh.

432
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:22,019
I shouldn't have said that,
I regret now.

433
00:40:22,612 --> 00:40:26,622
The value of people
isn't just college education.

434
00:40:26,855 --> 00:40:29,450
Don't become a white collar!

435
00:40:35,115 --> 00:40:37,862
That's why you called me
to come here?

436
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:45,128
You only live once, so treasure it.

437
00:40:46,608 --> 00:40:51,309
Too late to regret at my age.

438
00:40:54,455 --> 00:41:00,479
Listen, I also have a lot of things
that I want to say.

439
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:05,645
But I'm not saying it.
So quit lecturing.

440
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,046
What do you want to say?

441
00:41:11,523 --> 00:41:15,665
To say that you also were a victim?

442
00:41:17,038 --> 00:41:26,414
Dad, stop drinking.
Makes me miserable.

443
00:42:57,906 --> 00:43:01,843
That hill? Thanks.

444
00:43:36,444 --> 00:43:37,537
Hello.

445
00:43:37,979 --> 00:43:41,575
Hi! Why are you here?

446
00:43:43,752 --> 00:43:46,449
You forgot your textbook.

447
00:43:47,155 --> 00:43:48,646
You can't study during the holidays...

448
00:43:49,057 --> 00:43:51,049
without the textbook.

449
00:43:51,627 --> 00:43:56,122
So you brought it for me?

450
00:43:56,364 --> 00:43:58,924
I like bicycling around.

451
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:02,635
So I just stopped by.

452
00:44:03,204 --> 00:44:04,672
Goodbye.

453
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:09,177
Thanks a lot.

454
00:44:11,112 --> 00:44:13,604
Sawako, invite him for tea.

455
00:44:13,982 --> 00:44:15,974
He came a long way.

456
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:21,549
Takano, wait. Hey, Takano!

457
00:44:21,756 --> 00:44:22,485
Yes...!

458
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:31,519
I was surprised.

459
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,296
Wondered why you were here.

460
00:44:35,603 --> 00:44:37,628
Did I disturb you?

461
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,448
No, I wanted to study and

462
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:44,643
I need the textbook.

463
00:44:46,616 --> 00:44:49,051
Didn't know you were kind.

464
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:51,745
Me?

465
00:44:52,153 --> 00:44:56,682
You always look sullen in class...

466
00:44:56,891 --> 00:44:59,019
and you never talk.

467
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,729
Thought badly?

468
00:45:02,197 --> 00:45:05,861
We were saying,

469
00:45:06,267 --> 00:45:07,792
you probably bossed around before.

470
00:45:08,002 --> 00:45:10,631
- Really...
- Please.

471
00:45:18,064 --> 00:45:22,695
Tell me why did you quit?

472
00:45:26,076 --> 00:45:30,255
They condemned employees over 50.

473
00:45:30,433 --> 00:45:35,167
I was so enraged.
So I resigned in anger.

474
00:45:35,563 --> 00:45:38,328
I thought, heck,

475
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:42,163
there are other companies
that need me.

476
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:45,640
Big mistake.

477
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,635
You couldn't find any?

478
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:54,366
Unemployment office
introduced that school.

479
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:58,853
So that's why you're studying...

480
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,818
with other unemployed from
dinky company like me.

481
00:46:04,927 --> 00:46:09,194
I was hung over
on the first day of school.

482
00:46:09,864 --> 00:46:12,527
You looked gloomy.

483
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:14,161
You remember?

484
00:46:14,502 --> 00:46:17,666
Of course. You were late.

485
00:46:17,939 --> 00:46:23,105
I also remember
being surprised to see you.

486
00:46:23,478 --> 00:46:25,140
Just kidding.

487
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:34,790
- Is Mr. Kojima out?
- He's there.

488
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:07,745
He died 10 years ago.
My son is home.

489
00:47:10,158 --> 00:47:12,889
What if I poop on a Shinkansen?

490
00:47:13,228 --> 00:47:14,560
You can't do something like that.

491
00:47:14,729 --> 00:47:19,565
We have guest. My school classmate.

492
00:47:19,767 --> 00:47:21,395
Nice to meet you.

493
00:47:21,603 --> 00:47:23,504
Tommy, say hello.

494
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:25,867
Hello. Where is America?

495
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,339
Uh...America?

496
00:47:28,509 --> 00:47:30,034
Are there tunnels in America?

497
00:47:30,645 --> 00:47:31,806
Tunnels?

498
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:39,972
I don't know why he's interested in
tunnels and caves.

499
00:47:40,221 --> 00:47:41,553
He's been like this since he was a kid.

500
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:44,520
choo-choo-choo

501
00:47:44,726 --> 00:47:46,160
Tommy

502
00:47:47,262 --> 00:47:49,754
How many tunnels in Sanyo line?

503
00:47:51,332 --> 00:47:54,063
I got you ice-cream.

504
00:47:54,702 --> 00:47:57,069
What if I pee on a frying pan?

505
00:47:57,438 --> 00:48:01,705
We have a guest.

506
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,273
Itadakimasu.

507
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:08,018
He was a healthy pretty baby.

508
00:48:08,294 --> 00:48:14,234
Never dreamed that
he was handicapped. Please.

509
00:48:19,204 --> 00:48:21,639
When did you?

510
00:48:22,815 --> 00:48:27,218
When he was 2.
Something's wrong.

511
00:48:27,568 --> 00:48:30,037
Words were clear but...

512
00:48:30,305 --> 00:48:33,639
Didn't take me in.
No eye contact,

513
00:48:33,808 --> 00:48:35,709
and didn't hold me.

514
00:48:35,944 --> 00:48:39,608
When I took him to hospital,

515
00:48:39,814 --> 00:48:44,275
doctor said,
"typical case of infant autism".

516
00:48:44,485 --> 00:48:45,714
I see.

517
00:48:47,048 --> 00:48:53,818
It was a hot day.

518
00:48:54,123 --> 00:48:58,254
On the way home,
my face was wet from sweat and tears.

519
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:08,305
He's grown so much since,

520
00:49:10,338 --> 00:49:15,987
same thing everyday,
except our age.

521
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:20,866
Do you worry?

522
00:49:22,966 --> 00:49:26,198
About the future? Yes.

523
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:30,328
But I know I will die someday and,

524
00:49:30,664 --> 00:49:34,760
I think he will somehow find a way
to live on his own.

525
00:49:34,902 --> 00:49:37,303
Optimistic.

526
00:49:37,705 --> 00:49:39,367
I never wished...

527
00:49:41,425 --> 00:49:47,237
him or myself to be dead.

528
00:49:49,108 --> 00:49:52,793
Except, once I thought,

529
00:49:52,938 --> 00:49:57,569
if we could die together,
that'll be okay too.

530
00:49:59,348 --> 00:50:02,589
On a cable car in Zao,

531
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:04,673
Tommy got scared, went berserk,

532
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:12,261
I wished the cable to break
and let us fall together.

533
00:50:13,197 --> 00:50:19,398
When I came home and
told this to my husband,

534
00:50:19,647 --> 00:50:27,999
he got very angry.
He was in tears with rage.

535
00:50:31,059 --> 00:50:39,024
That was the first and
the last time I saw him so angry.

536
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:45,533
Parents' feelings.

537
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:52,374
I...I have a spoiled son.

538
00:50:52,747 --> 00:50:56,115
No. Actually I'm the one,

539
00:50:57,284 --> 00:51:00,684
I'm spoiled.

540
00:51:07,128 --> 00:51:11,122
You're up?
- Sorry.

541
00:51:11,365 --> 00:51:13,664
How many tunnels in Tohoku line?

542
00:51:13,868 --> 00:51:16,861
Tohoku line.
I'll find out later.

543
00:51:17,605 --> 00:51:19,073
How many tunnels in Argentina?

544
00:51:19,273 --> 00:51:22,209
Argentina. I'll find out that too.

545
00:51:22,877 --> 00:51:25,244
You're so earnest.

546
00:51:25,446 --> 00:51:28,041
I liked trains.

547
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:30,612
If I'm 68, how old are you?

548
00:51:33,955 --> 00:51:37,392
68? You're 16 now?

549
00:51:37,925 --> 00:51:40,292
What day is Saturday plus Saturday?

550
00:51:41,062 --> 00:51:44,726
Saturday plus Saturday?
That's a hard one.

551
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:51,967
Which bus goes to Tokiwadai
via tunnel?

552
00:51:54,876 --> 00:51:56,674
Good bye.

553
00:51:56,878 --> 00:51:58,471
Thank you today.

554
00:51:58,713 --> 00:52:00,375
See you in class.

555
00:52:00,648 --> 00:52:08,920
Yes. Takano,
don't be late for class.

556
00:52:09,123 --> 00:52:13,254
Always late. Not thought well of.

557
00:52:13,494 --> 00:52:17,192
I drink to sleep, a bad habit.

558
00:52:17,365 --> 00:52:21,461
I stay up late,
can't get up by myself.

559
00:52:21,669 --> 00:52:23,797
Your family?

560
00:52:25,374 --> 00:52:29,991
I'm living alone, we're separated.

561
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,382
Then, I'll call you in the morning.

562
00:52:36,727 --> 00:52:45,762
Will you? Bye, Tommy.

563
00:52:45,923 --> 00:52:49,985
Bye. Rocket in Mars.
Explode, bang!

564
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:56,463
Beautiful sunset.

565
00:52:57,342 --> 00:53:01,700
Many birds flying into sunset.

566
00:53:02,175 --> 00:53:07,481
Mom said. "Tommy, if we had wings,
we'd fly away with them."

567
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:13,449
Are people with wings human?

568
00:53:32,294 --> 00:53:33,262
Hello?

569
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:35,831
Morning! Get up!

570
00:53:36,002 --> 00:53:40,406
Yes, yes. Thank you.

571
00:54:07,805 --> 00:54:13,574
Now look.
To check if water level scale...

572
00:54:13,748 --> 00:54:16,616
is working correctly on boiler,

573
00:54:17,051 --> 00:54:20,215
shut steam and water cock.

574
00:54:20,454 --> 00:54:21,444
Morning.

575
00:54:22,323 --> 00:54:25,521
Takano. You're early.

576
00:54:27,295 --> 00:54:28,456
This first.

577
00:54:28,696 --> 00:54:30,688
I see. Then, drain cock.

578
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:34,459
Right, after draining, steam cock.

579
00:54:34,869 --> 00:54:38,829
Check steam, then shut.

580
00:54:39,206 --> 00:54:40,731
Water cock, check water, shut.

581
00:54:41,108 --> 00:54:42,701
Shut drain cock and done!

582
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:47,643
Not yet. Open steam, warm up tubes,

583
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:49,415
open water.

584
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,710
Check water level.

585
00:54:51,952 --> 00:54:54,512
Done.

586
00:54:55,456 --> 00:54:57,925
- Impressive, Kim.
- Thanks.

587
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:00,685
Grave as a tax collector.

588
00:55:00,928 --> 00:55:01,896
Hi.

589
00:55:11,739 --> 00:55:13,298
Everyone, good news!

590
00:55:13,574 --> 00:55:16,840
A grandchild was born to Cho.

591
00:55:17,062 --> 00:55:23,731
- Congratulations!
- Morning.

592
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:27,311
Kita, from office? Why?

593
00:55:27,488 --> 00:55:31,289
Mr. Nomura called,
he'll be late for a while.

594
00:55:31,525 --> 00:55:34,051
I'll be his substitute.

595
00:55:34,261 --> 00:55:35,661
Tell us a joke.

596
00:55:35,896 --> 00:55:40,630
You know my major?

597
00:55:43,601 --> 00:55:47,735
So, it has been 2 months,
since you came.

598
00:55:47,893 --> 00:55:50,059
Any comments or complaints,

599
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:52,919
about your classes?

600
00:55:53,955 --> 00:55:57,119
Please voice out.

601
00:56:04,044 --> 00:56:05,161
Yes.

602
00:56:05,993 --> 00:56:08,053
Anything?

603
00:56:08,229 --> 00:56:09,197
Sure.

604
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:14,893
I...I don't understand anything.

605
00:56:17,772 --> 00:56:20,674
It's too fast.

606
00:56:21,776 --> 00:56:23,404
All the jargons,

607
00:56:23,711 --> 00:56:25,009
enthal-pee, etc. Slips me.

608
00:56:25,379 --> 00:56:28,247
Incontinence?

609
00:56:32,081 --> 00:56:35,609
Thought studying will make me smarter.

610
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,784
Yes.

611
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:41,991
But the more I study,
the more confused I am.

612
00:56:42,534 --> 00:56:47,412
I feel more and more stupid.

613
00:56:48,335 --> 00:56:50,463
I agree.

614
00:56:50,871 --> 00:56:54,137
It's really not funny!

615
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:04,971
I understand. You're tired.

616
00:57:05,217 --> 00:57:07,152
And the weather's getting hotter.

617
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:11,920
Cheer up! Let's talk about...

618
00:57:12,293 --> 00:57:17,664
something else about "tools".

619
00:57:17,932 --> 00:57:21,494
Electricity and boiler.

620
00:57:21,702 --> 00:57:24,501
These are one of many
tools we created,

621
00:57:24,905 --> 00:57:29,605
in order to better our lives.

622
00:57:30,104 --> 00:57:35,270
Chalk, black board,

623
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:39,782
table, chair, car, train, etc.
are all "tools" of ours.

624
00:57:40,187 --> 00:57:43,680
You know our ancestors are apes.

625
00:57:43,891 --> 00:57:47,692
2 or 3 million years ago,

626
00:57:47,895 --> 00:57:51,525
our ancestor got on two feet.

627
00:57:51,732 --> 00:58:01,475
Grew tall. Remember the diagram?

628
00:58:01,834 --> 00:58:04,023
By standing, our hands were freed.

629
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:07,641
Free hands.

630
00:58:07,907 --> 00:58:12,572
I can throw. Or swing sticks,
throw these stones..

631
00:58:13,087 --> 00:58:15,750
Use of "tools",

632
00:58:15,923 --> 00:58:20,088
made us different from animals.

633
00:58:20,742 --> 00:58:25,557
Sticks and stones lead
to civilization.

634
00:58:26,147 --> 00:58:28,946
Then we found fire.

635
00:58:29,203 --> 00:58:33,140
Life rapidly improved.

636
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,638
With fire, we made iron.

637
00:58:36,826 --> 00:58:39,853
Later, over 200 years ago,

638
00:58:40,102 --> 00:58:45,097
James Watt invented an engine...

639
00:58:45,381 --> 00:58:47,871
to convert steam pressure to power.

640
00:58:48,063 --> 00:58:52,023
In other words, "boiler".
Your topic.

641
00:58:52,209 --> 00:58:58,149
So you ask yourselves,
"Watt's boiler"?

642
00:58:58,317 --> 00:58:59,910
Everyone is listening.

643
00:59:07,007 --> 00:59:13,125
It was the dawn of modern technology.

644
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:18,444
I just wanted to say
what you're learning...

645
00:59:18,786 --> 00:59:22,120
is the essence of it, the end.

646
00:59:24,058 --> 00:59:26,254
I feel cheated.

647
00:59:27,194 --> 00:59:28,890
Interesting.

648
00:59:29,096 --> 00:59:31,361
If all classes were as fun.

649
00:59:31,565 --> 00:59:35,024
But don't ask that in exam.

650
00:59:35,869 --> 00:59:38,771
Good morning.
Enjoy your class.

651
00:59:42,076 --> 00:59:45,604
Let us start. Page 27.

652
00:59:46,896 --> 00:59:50,731
Boiler maintenance. Article 24...

653
01:00:02,096 --> 01:00:07,228
He will be on his way.
Here's the map.

654
01:00:13,807 --> 01:00:15,969
What's gotten into you?

655
01:00:16,176 --> 01:00:20,341
You're unemployed, why "schooling"?

656
01:00:20,581 --> 01:00:23,983
Told you, it's for work.

657
01:00:24,151 --> 01:00:28,612
I need to have some skills.

658
01:00:28,822 --> 01:00:31,724
Will that ensure you a job?

659
01:00:32,126 --> 01:00:33,890
I don't know.

660
01:00:34,061 --> 01:00:38,465
See! I'm saying it's unlikely.

661
01:00:38,632 --> 01:00:42,694
Consider your age.

662
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:46,534
You're over 40. Get married.

663
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,841
I'll arrange someone for you,

664
01:00:49,243 --> 01:00:52,008
I've been looking.

665
01:00:52,346 --> 01:00:54,144
This person.

666
01:00:54,381 --> 01:00:57,442
He's a friend of my father's.

667
01:00:58,352 --> 01:01:01,083
You wanted to tell me this?

668
01:01:01,522 --> 01:01:03,650
He's a nice person.

669
01:01:03,824 --> 01:01:08,592
His wife died a year ago.
He needs someone.

670
01:01:09,163 --> 01:01:12,998
I told him about Tommy.

671
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,295
He said one of his relatives has,

672
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:19,162
you know..."slowish" child.

673
01:01:19,606 --> 01:01:23,373
So he's accustomed.

674
01:01:23,777 --> 01:01:26,508
Isn't he nice?

675
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,375
Look, he's the second from the right.
Little thinning.

676
01:01:31,852 --> 01:01:35,755
Auntie, thanks, but...

677
01:01:35,956 --> 01:01:37,891
What's look?

678
01:01:38,058 --> 01:01:42,291
Appearance only matters
when you're young.

679
01:01:42,463 --> 01:01:44,523
When I met uncle,

680
01:01:44,832 --> 01:01:47,461
I thought, "yuck!"

681
01:01:47,801 --> 01:01:54,002
But I gradually got used to him.
It's all about money at your age.

682
01:01:54,408 --> 01:01:57,970
He seems to have savings.

683
01:02:00,364 --> 01:02:03,027
- Excuse me.
- Customer!

684
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:07,333
I have to go to a meeting.

685
01:02:07,955 --> 01:02:10,550
Stay longer. Uncle's late.

686
01:02:36,583 --> 01:02:37,573
Have a seat.

687
01:02:39,019 --> 01:02:42,820
It's August. Wear lighter clothes.

688
01:02:43,629 --> 01:02:46,188
They are on cheap sales.

689
01:02:46,393 --> 01:02:48,160
Coffee for me.
- Yes.

690
01:02:54,893 --> 01:02:57,920
Here, your dad's keepsake.

691
01:02:58,351 --> 01:03:00,513
It was in the cabinet.

692
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,349
Wanted Hajime to give you.

693
01:03:06,173 --> 01:03:08,610
How's work?

694
01:03:10,652 --> 01:03:15,133
Bad. Bad sales. Banks don't lend.

695
01:03:15,956 --> 01:03:18,619
I fired a girl.

696
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:26,148
- Find a job?
- No, not yet.

697
01:03:29,659 --> 01:03:33,323
You're still going to that school?

698
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:38,444
- Summer holiday now.
- Excuse me.

699
01:03:53,026 --> 01:03:54,961
How's Hajime?

700
01:03:55,128 --> 01:03:57,154
Cramming school.

701
01:03:58,727 --> 01:04:01,162
Is he okay?

702
01:04:02,507 --> 01:04:06,968
Hajime is far more capable
than you think.

703
01:04:07,275 --> 01:04:11,303
- You just don't know.
- I see.

704
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:27,424
Retirement pay.

705
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:32,483
This should cover all mortgage,
and leave you change.

706
01:04:32,795 --> 01:04:35,748
Use it for Hajime's school...

707
01:04:39,573 --> 01:04:41,166
Takano speaking.

708
01:04:42,622 --> 01:04:44,674
How's it?

709
01:04:49,383 --> 01:04:52,444
Tell them I'll be there.

710
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,445
Say hi to Hajime.

711
01:04:58,325 --> 01:05:06,097
Okay, I'll call again.

712
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:22,652
- Oh, hi!
- What are you doing?

713
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,151
Uh...just eating doughnuts.

714
01:06:28,515 --> 01:06:30,541
Surprised to see you.

715
01:06:30,751 --> 01:06:32,720
Tommy, Mr. Takano.

716
01:06:32,919 --> 01:06:36,447
Hello Tommy! Hot, eh?

717
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:38,524
Will you die?

718
01:06:38,792 --> 01:06:44,288
Surely, the heat is killing.

719
01:06:44,531 --> 01:06:48,730
Sometimes, he says strange things.

720
01:06:48,969 --> 01:06:51,200
When's your funeral?

721
01:06:51,471 --> 01:06:54,930
Mine? Maybe soon.

722
01:06:55,175 --> 01:06:57,337
Who'll come to your funeral?

723
01:06:57,611 --> 01:07:01,844
Important people,
like Prime Minister.

724
01:07:02,215 --> 01:07:04,548
Stop kidding around.

725
01:07:08,021 --> 01:07:10,991
Tommy! Hi!

726
01:07:12,392 --> 01:07:15,226
My friend. Remember her?

727
01:07:15,729 --> 01:07:17,357
- Yes, hello.
- Hello.

728
01:07:17,597 --> 01:07:19,122
We bumped into each other.

729
01:07:19,433 --> 01:07:21,459
Not to beach. Scary.

730
01:07:21,768 --> 01:07:23,396
I'll be there for you.

731
01:07:23,603 --> 01:07:26,573
We're off to the beach till tomorrow.

732
01:07:26,773 --> 01:07:29,709
Beach...sounds great.

733
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:35,173
Sorry, we have to go.

734
01:07:35,449 --> 01:07:36,815
See you. Enjoy it!

735
01:07:37,702 --> 01:07:39,998
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

736
01:07:40,529 --> 01:07:42,498
- Let's go.
- Come on Ken.

737
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:45,720
Antares, Scorpion...

738
01:07:47,094 --> 01:07:48,426
So long.

739
01:08:08,782 --> 01:08:12,082
Come to the beach with us.

740
01:08:12,252 --> 01:08:15,381
- What?
- You have plans?

741
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,296
No, no.

742
01:08:18,443 --> 01:08:20,173
Then come!

743
01:08:21,661 --> 01:08:25,928
- I'm not wearing pants.
- What?

744
01:08:27,113 --> 01:08:29,449
I mean, swimming pants.

745
01:08:31,505 --> 01:08:34,339
Tommy's swimming!

746
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:40,505
Hey, he's swimming! You okay?

747
01:08:59,499 --> 01:09:02,936
You know, Tommy likes tunnels.

748
01:09:03,236 --> 01:09:04,260
I know.

749
01:09:10,076 --> 01:09:11,704
Grand opening!

750
01:09:12,312 --> 01:09:16,147
Oshima tunnel opened!
Euro tunnel opened!

751
01:09:16,316 --> 01:09:20,151
Yes! It opened!

752
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,380
Ken, Tommy has a love?

753
01:09:22,589 --> 01:09:24,524
- He does.
- Who?

754
01:09:24,691 --> 01:09:26,990
Tommy, you like Yuki?

755
01:09:27,194 --> 01:09:28,992
No I don't, I don't.

756
01:09:29,396 --> 01:09:32,332
When he says no, he means yes.

757
01:09:32,699 --> 01:09:34,691
Tommy's handsome.

758
01:09:34,901 --> 01:09:37,496
He was pretty as a girl baby.

759
01:09:40,307 --> 01:09:43,072
Really. What about your love, Ken?

760
01:09:43,276 --> 01:09:46,007
Me? Appropriately.

761
01:09:48,574 --> 01:09:50,304
Tommy, here that? "Appropriately".

762
01:09:53,253 --> 01:09:57,247
Father is probably necessary for boys.

763
01:09:59,659 --> 01:10:01,753
Let's go swim Tommy!

764
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,327
Yes let's go Tommy!

765
01:10:08,735 --> 01:10:09,794
Hurry!

766
01:10:10,003 --> 01:10:12,131
It's not scary, come.

767
01:10:13,837 --> 01:10:15,305
Let me see Tommy.

768
01:10:15,478 --> 01:10:16,304
Pegasus, Pegasus.

769
01:10:16,451 --> 01:10:18,010
Pegasus.

770
01:10:18,968 --> 01:10:21,479
Tommy likes constellations.

771
01:10:21,773 --> 01:10:24,091
- Yes.
- Why?

772
01:10:24,266 --> 01:10:26,701
It never changes.

773
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:29,734
Never betrays him, never ever.

774
01:10:31,284 --> 01:10:34,003
Unlike people.

775
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:37,801
Why moon? It wane and wax.

776
01:10:38,531 --> 01:10:45,585
It's been repeated
for millions of years.

777
01:10:45,811 --> 01:10:48,804
He loves the moon.

778
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:51,157
It doesn't betray him either.

779
01:10:51,594 --> 01:10:54,119
- Tommy, watermelon.
- Yes.

780
01:10:55,463 --> 01:10:57,056
Touch head?

781
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:01,420
What? You like my hair?
You can touch it.

782
01:11:02,076 --> 01:11:05,639
Tommy, I told you not to bother her.

783
01:11:06,734 --> 01:11:12,006
It's okay. I don't mind at all.

784
01:11:14,997 --> 01:11:21,927
He wants to touch beautiful hair.

785
01:11:22,425 --> 01:11:28,254
I think I understand...sort of.

786
01:11:28,596 --> 01:11:30,656
Peculiar.

787
01:11:31,266 --> 01:11:37,672
- Stop it.
- Tommy, Tommy, stop.

788
01:11:37,906 --> 01:11:40,341
Mommy's going
to sing for you. Ready?

789
01:11:41,556 --> 01:11:48,607
Ai-Ai, Ai-Ai, little monkey.

790
01:11:49,252 --> 01:11:56,121
Ai-Ai, Ai-Ai, on southern island.

791
01:11:56,537 --> 01:12:03,740
Ai-Ai, Ai-Ai, with a long tail.

792
01:12:04,037 --> 01:12:11,537
Ai-Ai, Ai-Ai, little monkey

793
01:12:11,984 --> 01:12:13,748
An old song.

794
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:19,192
- You know this song?
- No.

795
01:12:19,318 --> 01:12:22,550
You were probably busy working.

796
01:12:23,257 --> 01:12:27,524
Kids' TV program song,
very popular.

797
01:12:28,244 --> 01:12:33,099
Baby Tommy, responded to the song.

798
01:12:33,742 --> 01:12:38,802
So when he got alarmed,
and went berserk,

799
01:12:38,933 --> 01:12:44,770
we sang this and it calmed him.
Right, Sawako?

800
01:12:47,005 --> 01:12:51,554
I once dressed like the singer
in the program.

801
01:12:51,797 --> 01:12:54,357
Tommy loved it.

802
01:12:54,479 --> 01:12:58,211
He wanted me to wear it
all the time.

803
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:03,381
If I didn't he would go berserk.

804
01:13:03,658 --> 01:13:08,255
So again I ended up doing "Ai-Ai".

805
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:11,325
Few hundred times!

806
01:13:17,572 --> 01:13:24,604
Remember, when we went to a store,
Tommy must have wanted a toy,

807
01:13:24,946 --> 01:13:30,510
he suddenly started hollering.

808
01:13:30,885 --> 01:13:39,294
So at the cashier, you stated "Ai-Ai",
everyone around was shocked,

809
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:45,078
but you had to keep on
dancing and singing with all might.

810
01:13:45,294 --> 01:13:51,131
I was so hit by that,

811
01:13:52,173 --> 01:13:54,938
brought me tears.

812
01:14:01,329 --> 01:14:07,218
I'm so moved by your story.

813
01:14:08,829 --> 01:14:13,359
I can't speak. So let me sing.

814
01:14:19,044 --> 01:14:28,167
When the summer is over,
I will be gone.

815
01:14:28,614 --> 01:14:38,442
When summer comes back, so will I.

816
01:14:38,953 --> 01:14:47,657
I don't like babysitting,
for crying babies,

817
01:14:47,845 --> 01:14:56,777
because I get blamed
for making them cry.

818
01:15:04,222 --> 01:15:07,056
Didn't know his character..

819
01:15:07,168 --> 01:15:09,603
- You mean Takano?
- Yes.

820
01:15:10,118 --> 01:15:13,486
Come on, he's typical,

821
01:15:13,721 --> 01:15:18,125
estranged by family by
just devoting to work.

822
01:15:19,501 --> 01:15:21,436
Once retired,

823
01:15:21,578 --> 01:15:24,571
don't know what to do.

824
01:15:25,606 --> 01:15:29,151
Just like Tommy, his head is blank.

825
01:15:30,004 --> 01:15:33,031
- May I?
- Come in.

826
01:15:35,276 --> 01:15:39,270
- Where to?
- To see stars.

827
01:15:43,284 --> 01:15:45,446
Will you turn off the light?

828
01:15:45,653 --> 01:15:50,648
- Yes. Good night!
- Good night!

829
01:16:03,204 --> 01:16:06,402
Great summer.

830
01:16:07,542 --> 01:16:17,541
Rape flower, blossoms, camellia...

831
01:16:44,622 --> 01:16:48,320
Hey, they're making fun of us.

832
01:16:50,184 --> 01:16:53,643
What's so funny? Stop laughing.

833
01:16:54,022 --> 01:16:55,888
Why do they...

834
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:58,887
dye their hair?

835
01:17:01,071 --> 01:17:06,309
Feed enthalpy,
divided by calorie equals 539.

836
01:17:06,467 --> 01:17:11,167
Equation of capacity

837
01:17:11,873 --> 01:17:14,968
To memorize,

838
01:17:15,176 --> 01:17:25,175
Ge=Gx(h2-h1) divided by 539.

839
01:17:28,747 --> 01:17:31,046
Very important.

840
01:17:31,414 --> 01:17:35,146
Now, boiler handling.

841
01:17:35,473 --> 01:17:38,375
Common exam question.

842
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:41,249
Mr. Saito!

843
01:17:50,878 --> 01:17:53,575
Kojima. Police called.

844
01:17:53,748 --> 01:17:55,910
Your son had an accident.

845
01:17:56,117 --> 01:17:58,882
Go now. This hospital.

846
01:18:04,759 --> 01:18:05,727
Yes...yes.

847
01:18:30,130 --> 01:18:32,190
To Akabane.

848
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,050
Go fast! Speed!

849
01:18:34,322 --> 01:18:35,620
Hear me?

850
01:18:35,925 --> 01:18:41,436
Wait! Use this.

851
01:18:42,578 --> 01:18:45,567
- Thanks.
- Now, go! Go!

852
01:18:51,345 --> 01:18:54,247
That was a good move.

853
01:18:54,559 --> 01:18:56,619
Money helps.

854
01:18:56,722 --> 01:18:59,191
Unemployment allowance.

855
01:18:59,584 --> 01:19:03,248
Really used wisely.

856
01:19:32,346 --> 01:19:35,180
Tommy, Tommy!

857
01:19:36,859 --> 01:19:41,661
I am his mother.
How was the operation?

858
01:19:42,089 --> 01:19:44,752
Everything went well.

859
01:19:45,026 --> 01:19:49,589
Thank you. My son is handicapped.

860
01:19:49,831 --> 01:19:52,232
- Yes, we know.
- Thank you.

861
01:19:55,036 --> 01:19:56,800
W...Where am I?

862
01:19:57,004 --> 01:20:02,272
Tommy, you ride on
the left hand side.

863
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:07,005
Not in the middle of the road.

864
01:20:07,315 --> 01:20:10,808
Or you get hurt like this.
Left side.

865
01:20:11,244 --> 01:20:14,339
Will you die, will you...

866
01:20:14,929 --> 01:20:20,232
You're asking, "will I die"?

867
01:20:20,328 --> 01:20:25,665
You're okay, doctor said there
is nothing wrong.

868
01:20:25,991 --> 01:20:29,450
You won't die, okay? Never.

869
01:20:29,637 --> 01:20:31,936
Not hurt, not hurt,
not hurt, not...

870
01:20:32,173 --> 01:20:40,047
No, it doesn't hurt.

871
01:20:40,348 --> 01:20:44,581
Big boy. Strong boy.

872
01:20:44,919 --> 01:20:50,977
There are other people,
we have to keep quiet.

873
01:20:53,121 --> 01:20:57,492
- I'm leaving.
- Thank you.

874
01:20:57,765 --> 01:21:00,564
I was with him...sorry.

875
01:21:00,768 --> 01:21:04,227
Don't, it's not your fault.

876
01:21:05,766 --> 01:21:08,463
Take care Tommy.

877
01:21:08,767 --> 01:21:12,260
Russia, which way?

878
01:21:15,351 --> 01:21:19,447
That way, far away.

879
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:25,282
- Bye bye.
- Thanks.

880
01:21:30,152 --> 01:21:34,980
My son's name is Tomio Kojima.

881
01:21:35,499 --> 01:21:39,707
He has difficulties to communicate,

882
01:21:39,893 --> 01:21:42,333
and may cause you inconveniences,

883
01:21:42,594 --> 01:21:44,529
I ask for your understanding.

884
01:21:44,879 --> 01:21:48,077
May I take your temperature.

885
01:21:48,249 --> 01:21:51,242
Not hurt! Not hurt!

886
01:22:08,135 --> 01:22:14,268
Shirt...pajama...

887
01:22:48,433 --> 01:22:49,833
I'm back.

888
01:22:52,213 --> 01:22:59,620
I go home by Saturday?

889
01:23:00,154 --> 01:23:02,316
Not hurt! Not hurt!

890
01:23:03,024 --> 01:23:08,156
Big boy.

891
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:17,434
Tommy's brave. So strong.

892
01:23:18,329 --> 01:23:21,231
Not hurt! Not hurt!

893
01:23:23,559 --> 01:23:27,724
W...Where am I?

894
01:23:28,282 --> 01:23:33,760
Damn it, can't sleep!

895
01:23:35,292 --> 01:23:37,727
Sorry to disturb.

896
01:23:37,811 --> 01:23:40,406
I came about my son.

897
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:44,317
Come in, we wanted to know.

898
01:23:48,878 --> 01:23:53,779
Please. When speaking to him,

899
01:23:53,974 --> 01:23:58,241
please don't use childish words.

900
01:23:58,579 --> 01:24:02,243
It might feel like you're talking to a baby.
But he has his 16 year-old pride.

901
01:24:02,483 --> 01:24:05,112
Please treat him like an adult.

902
01:24:06,127 --> 01:24:10,929
It's difficult for him
to express himself,

903
01:24:11,058 --> 01:24:14,517
so sometimes
he might do absurd things.

904
01:24:14,728 --> 01:24:18,597
But please try to see his needs,

905
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:23,134
before you scold him out right.

906
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:28,097
I'm really sorry for all the trouble.

907
01:24:28,275 --> 01:24:31,040
We understand.

908
01:24:31,145 --> 01:24:33,444
If he does something right,

909
01:24:33,814 --> 01:24:35,578
please praise him for it.

910
01:24:35,948 --> 01:24:39,379
Although not overly.

911
01:24:39,553 --> 01:24:40,851
You know?

912
01:24:41,055 --> 01:24:45,516
Of course.
That's what child raising is.

913
01:24:46,008 --> 01:24:49,991
Yes? We'll be there.

914
01:24:50,164 --> 01:24:52,224
Room 307, drip is done.

915
01:25:09,902 --> 01:25:11,734
Hi.

916
01:25:12,165 --> 01:25:16,125
You came for me at this hour?

917
01:25:17,048 --> 01:25:21,085
Go home and sleep tonight,
I'll watch him,

918
01:25:21,835 --> 01:25:24,634
many more days ahead.

919
01:25:26,404 --> 01:25:28,168
Thanks.

920
01:25:30,104 --> 01:25:33,404
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning,

921
01:25:33,607 --> 01:25:35,974
sleep till then.

922
01:25:36,944 --> 01:25:38,344
Studying?

923
01:26:24,361 --> 01:26:26,159
You came?

924
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,701
I didn't know which hospital,

925
01:26:28,957 --> 01:26:31,449
thought I'd see you here.

926
01:26:32,016 --> 01:26:37,344
- How's Tommy?
- He's okay.

927
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:41,446
- Good.
- Thanks.

928
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:46,221
Come in.

929
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:48,246
It's late...

930
01:26:48,887 --> 01:26:51,314
Come on, come in.

931
01:27:07,815 --> 01:27:16,192
Let me. Tired?

932
01:27:18,076 --> 01:27:27,608
- I'm glad you came.
- Good. Good work.

933
01:27:37,969 --> 01:27:40,591
Tastes so good.

934
01:27:46,104 --> 01:27:47,484
What?

935
01:27:48,123 --> 01:27:53,084
I was imagining you buying this.

936
01:27:54,148 --> 01:27:56,413
As is.

937
01:27:59,219 --> 01:28:02,656
Ah. Mr. Saito wished you well.

938
01:28:03,106 --> 01:28:07,453
Today's class was especially difficult.

939
01:28:08,739 --> 01:28:10,765
I'll teach you.

940
01:28:11,598 --> 01:28:15,592
I got I after someone taught me.

941
01:28:23,272 --> 01:28:26,879
Sleepy? Let's stop.

942
01:28:27,181 --> 01:28:33,519
- I'm fine. Teach me.
- Page 125.

943
01:28:36,008 --> 01:28:40,391
You asked about
the number 539 calories.

944
01:28:40,582 --> 01:28:42,517
At reference point?

945
01:28:42,663 --> 01:28:47,499
Correct. 539 calories
at reference point.

946
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:50,364
You have to memorize it.

947
01:28:57,678 --> 01:29:01,240
- You okay?
- Yes.

948
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:07,856
Example question.

949
01:29:09,435 --> 01:29:12,002
Take notes as I read.

950
01:29:13,523 --> 01:29:18,243
Feed enthalpy h1,
is 18 kilo calories.

951
01:29:19,345 --> 01:29:24,454
If G is 3500kg per hour,

952
01:29:24,638 --> 01:29:28,370
in boiler at pressure of 5kg per cm2,

953
01:29:28,675 --> 01:29:32,908
what is the correct scale evaporation?

954
01:29:33,313 --> 01:29:36,841
Here, vapor enthalpy h2,

955
01:29:37,017 --> 01:29:41,887
for 5kg per cm2 is 657.9 kilo calories.

956
01:29:42,901 --> 01:29:47,735
Answer 1 is 6578...

957
01:30:27,665 --> 01:30:28,928
Kojima?

958
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:57,170
Dear everyone, I appreciate,

959
01:32:57,345 --> 01:32:59,643
everything you have done for me.

960
01:33:00,821 --> 01:33:05,850
My son's wounds are healing well.

961
01:33:08,144 --> 01:33:12,941
Have you started looking for jobs?

962
01:33:15,135 --> 01:33:17,969
Hello. Air-conditioner maintenance.

963
01:33:23,174 --> 01:33:27,168
How is job availability?

964
01:33:29,062 --> 01:33:31,983
TV news and newspapers

965
01:33:32,152 --> 01:33:37,614
always talk of unemployment
and closures, it worries me.

966
01:33:37,991 --> 01:33:39,857
Will the time come,

967
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:42,489
after working day and night,

968
01:33:42,763 --> 01:33:49,033
to see peaceful retirement?

969
01:33:49,503 --> 01:33:53,065
Will it ever come?

970
01:33:53,258 --> 01:33:58,890
I wonder as I see the elderly
in hospital. It kills me.

971
01:33:59,992 --> 01:34:04,040
Pink circles mean exam questions.

972
01:34:05,687 --> 01:34:09,146
How was school today?

973
01:34:09,503 --> 01:34:14,593
Morning exercise. Weather was good.

974
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:18,576
Afternoon class was difficult.

975
01:34:19,138 --> 01:34:22,905
Lunch was catered. Very tasty.

976
01:34:23,737 --> 01:34:27,037
Sounds like Tommy's essays.

977
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:30,472
Went to restaurant.
Drank juice. Tasty.

978
01:34:30,844 --> 01:34:32,972
Train was fun.

979
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:36,275
Oooh God. Will I get better?
I'm fed up.

980
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:42,002
It's Autumn skill festival soon.

981
01:34:42,339 --> 01:34:46,902
I'm hoping to go back before that...

982
01:34:46,975 --> 01:34:51,640
to catch up with class.

983
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:58,029
See you then, all the best,
Sawako Kojima.

984
01:35:04,209 --> 01:35:10,274
September 7th, clear sky.
I went to mom's school.

985
01:35:10,650 --> 01:35:13,779
Nobody was in uniform.

986
01:35:13,987 --> 01:35:19,392
Is it really school? Or factory?

987
01:35:34,352 --> 01:35:44,092
- They're here.
- How are you?

988
01:35:51,491 --> 01:36:01,094
Love, my love, burnt up
and turned the sky crimson.

989
01:36:01,434 --> 01:36:07,431
"Until death,
I'll never leave you."

990
01:36:07,808 --> 01:36:15,045
He "whiskered" to me.
My love season.

991
01:36:15,248 --> 01:36:24,055
Love, my love, burnt up
and turned the sky crimson.

992
01:36:25,659 --> 01:36:27,025
Terrible.

993
01:36:27,294 --> 01:36:29,286
My wife and daughter.

994
01:36:30,091 --> 01:36:35,587
- Tommy, my son.
- Hello.

995
01:36:39,406 --> 01:36:47,542
"Morning coffee, together,
just two of us."

996
01:36:47,781 --> 01:36:57,780
He "whiskered" to me.
My love season.

997
01:37:10,203 --> 01:37:14,766
Ready? Smile everyone!

998
01:37:17,091 --> 01:37:20,339
Peace!

999
01:37:29,089 --> 01:37:33,356
"Morning coffee, together,
just two of us."

1000
01:37:33,693 --> 01:37:34,592
Onizuka was mad.

1001
01:37:34,828 --> 01:37:37,764
"I hate you!"

1002
01:37:37,998 --> 01:37:42,595
"Morning coffee, together,
just two of us."

1003
01:37:43,003 --> 01:37:44,869
"Morning coffee, together,
just two of us."

1004
01:37:45,071 --> 01:37:48,473
Thanks for the ride.

1005
01:37:49,276 --> 01:37:51,871
Tommy, visit us again.

1006
01:37:52,078 --> 01:37:54,946
- Good night.
- Bye, Tommy.

1007
01:38:04,090 --> 01:38:05,752
You forgot.

1008
01:38:12,791 --> 01:38:16,091
I wished it was just the two of us.

1009
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:19,337
I'll see you tomorrow.

1010
01:38:39,881 --> 01:38:42,817
On the road, not in the middle.

1011
01:38:43,038 --> 01:38:48,698
Keep left on the road.
Left side, left...

1012
01:38:49,035 --> 01:38:55,771
September 16th, clear sky.
Mom's exam day.

1013
01:38:57,161 --> 01:39:00,689
She said "I'd fail anyway."

1014
01:39:00,939 --> 01:39:04,706
If she'd "fail anyway",
why take it?

1015
01:39:05,955 --> 01:39:08,891
Poop mom?

1016
01:39:08,989 --> 01:39:10,355
Why no poop mom?

1017
01:39:10,523 --> 01:39:12,549
Poop not yet?

1018
01:39:12,726 --> 01:39:15,127
I was studying.

1019
01:39:15,795 --> 01:39:19,391
Air contaminants are...

1020
01:39:19,766 --> 01:39:21,257
SOx, NOx and dust.

1021
01:39:21,434 --> 01:39:25,735
symbol is...

1022
01:39:25,939 --> 01:39:28,272
SO2, sulphur trioxide is SO3,

1023
01:39:28,541 --> 01:39:30,009
Nitrogen monoxide is NO,
nitrogen dioxide is NO2

1024
01:39:30,443 --> 01:39:31,843
You memorized all?

1025
01:39:32,045 --> 01:39:37,211
Before me? I'm the one who's going.

1026
01:39:37,517 --> 01:39:40,112
Thermal Knox, fuel NOx.

1027
01:39:40,353 --> 01:39:43,016
Helper will come at one.
Then go to therapy with you.

1028
01:39:43,289 --> 01:39:44,052
I go at one.

1029
01:39:44,257 --> 01:39:46,658
Be home in evening, okay?

1030
01:39:46,926 --> 01:39:47,586
Okay.

1031
01:39:47,827 --> 01:39:51,229
I'll pass. Maybe not.

1032
01:39:51,998 --> 01:39:54,968
Can't beat men.

1033
01:39:55,268 --> 01:39:57,601
- Can't.
- Bye.

1034
01:40:09,269 --> 01:40:10,974
No...

1035
01:40:25,732 --> 01:40:28,201
Done? Bye.

1036
01:41:15,782 --> 01:41:17,341
Uh-oh.

1037
01:41:17,784 --> 01:41:18,911
Why yellow rain?

1038
01:41:19,085 --> 01:41:20,144
Hi Tommy!

1039
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:21,911
How long is Shintanna tunnel?

1040
01:41:22,222 --> 01:41:22,985
Express.

1041
01:41:23,123 --> 01:41:24,421
How long is Kanmon tunnel?

1042
01:41:24,624 --> 01:41:28,356
I've learned that in school.

1043
01:41:28,495 --> 01:41:30,327
A bit over 1km?

1044
01:41:35,835 --> 01:41:38,805
Crib, Crib. You, crib when?

1045
01:41:38,972 --> 01:41:40,463
That again?

1046
01:41:41,808 --> 01:41:45,245
Don't say if before people,

1047
01:41:45,512 --> 01:41:48,482
Mom never cribbed.

1048
01:41:49,568 --> 01:41:52,799
I...I just saw it by accident...

1049
01:41:53,486 --> 01:41:55,512
Boiler, Sawako Kojima.

1050
01:41:55,755 --> 01:41:57,383
Express mail?

1051
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:06,688
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

1052
01:42:06,833 --> 01:42:10,167
Tommy, I passed!

1053
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:14,034
Banzai! Banzai! I passed!

1054
01:42:14,317 --> 01:42:17,617
- Behaving.
- Tommy, thanks!

1055
01:42:17,911 --> 01:42:18,688
No screaming!

1056
01:42:18,845 --> 01:42:21,144
I cry when I'm sad,

1057
01:42:21,381 --> 01:42:27,981
mom cries when she's happy.
Maybe there's something wrong with her.

1058
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:38,653
Hello?

1059
01:42:39,044 --> 01:42:44,813
It's me. I passed.
2nd class boiler exam.

1060
01:42:45,552 --> 01:42:46,884
Hear me?

1061
01:42:47,501 --> 01:42:50,543
Congratulations. Great job!

1062
01:42:50,894 --> 01:42:54,108
Thanks.

1063
01:42:54,347 --> 01:42:55,906
- I wanted to tell you first thing.
- Good.

1064
01:42:56,149 --> 01:42:58,550
Thought I would fail.

1065
01:42:58,685 --> 01:43:00,950
I've been telling myself that...

1066
01:43:01,154 --> 01:43:04,124
I will try again.

1067
01:43:04,324 --> 01:43:07,886
I'm crying in joy.

1068
01:43:08,294 --> 01:43:12,026
Sorry, I'm babbling.

1069
01:43:12,517 --> 01:43:17,738
- How about you?
- I failed.

1070
01:43:20,229 --> 01:43:24,772
- What?
- Just kidding.

1071
01:43:30,704 --> 01:43:34,766
I passed also. Barely.

1072
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:37,217
You scared me.

1073
01:43:37,390 --> 01:43:40,189
I'm not used to you joking.

1074
01:43:40,628 --> 01:43:42,688
Let's celebrate.

1075
01:43:43,957 --> 01:43:46,586
- When?
- Tonight?

1076
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:52,159
I can't. Club meeting for parents
with handicapped kids.

1077
01:43:52,272 --> 01:43:53,240
Is hair sweet?

1078
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:54,600
So when?

1079
01:43:54,865 --> 01:43:57,027
What about Friday after
the graduation ceremony?

1080
01:43:57,206 --> 01:43:59,835
Do you have time?

1081
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:03,614
Yes, I have time the whole day.

1082
01:44:04,273 --> 01:44:08,830
Just two of us that night, okay?

1083
01:44:09,121 --> 01:44:13,559
- Yes, just two of us.
- Good bye.

1084
01:44:25,738 --> 01:44:30,369
When the summer is over,
I will be gone.

1085
01:44:30,576 --> 01:44:33,205
When summer comes back, so will I.

1086
01:44:35,987 --> 01:44:43,004
September 25th, clear sky.
Mom's graduation.

1087
01:44:44,109 --> 01:44:47,944
Mom's slow but she can graduate,

1088
01:44:48,165 --> 01:44:51,158
maybe because she studied.

1089
01:44:51,841 --> 01:44:56,142
Tommy, I have an important plan,

1090
01:44:56,275 --> 01:45:00,110
that's why I'll be late.

1091
01:45:00,348 --> 01:45:03,007
Don't you understand?

1092
01:45:03,176 --> 01:45:05,475
Mom will be late.

1093
01:45:05,853 --> 01:45:11,121
Yes. Eat by yourself
and go to sleep.

1094
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:12,377
Sleep alone.

1095
01:45:13,355 --> 01:45:17,046
Mom will be late, but
promise to come home.

1096
01:45:17,428 --> 01:45:18,657
Promise.

1097
01:45:19,377 --> 01:45:22,196
- Understood?
- Yes.

1098
01:45:22,705 --> 01:45:25,240
Okay. Bye.

1099
01:45:29,937 --> 01:45:32,338
Mom not coming home!

1100
01:45:32,472 --> 01:45:36,307
Gone, never see her again.

1101
01:45:42,148 --> 01:45:42,945
Tommy.

1102
01:45:43,116 --> 01:45:45,051
Mom not coming home!

1103
01:45:45,251 --> 01:45:47,447
I will be late,

1104
01:45:47,921 --> 01:45:50,289
but I will come home.

1105
01:45:51,096 --> 01:45:53,014
Please understand.

1106
01:45:58,130 --> 01:46:05,663
It's a happy day for mom,
a special day.

1107
01:46:06,767 --> 01:46:08,424
Gone.

1108
01:46:08,674 --> 01:46:10,199
You want that?

1109
01:46:10,410 --> 01:46:12,402
Mom not coming home!

1110
01:46:13,112 --> 01:46:15,741
You want me to go away?

1111
01:46:17,445 --> 01:46:20,533
Mom going away?

1112
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:23,268
Gone?

1113
01:46:23,689 --> 01:46:25,817
Not coming home?

1114
01:46:33,207 --> 01:46:37,303
Onizuka, ever amorous attire.

1115
01:46:39,839 --> 01:46:45,176
I will give out the diploma. Senda.

1116
01:46:45,344 --> 01:46:46,312
Yes.

1117
01:46:49,927 --> 01:46:53,795
Health is important,
take good care.

1118
01:46:53,953 --> 01:46:56,252
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1119
01:46:58,357 --> 01:46:59,825
- Kudo.
- Yes.

1120
01:47:02,007 --> 01:47:02,997
Congratulations.

1121
01:47:03,129 --> 01:47:05,621
Glad you found a job.
Are you happy?

1122
01:47:06,057 --> 01:47:07,286
Yes.

1123
01:47:13,806 --> 01:47:15,866
- Shimada.
- Yes.

1124
01:47:18,805 --> 01:47:21,775
Cooperation is important.

1125
01:47:21,907 --> 01:47:25,400
Please keep it in your mind.
Congratulations.

1126
01:47:25,952 --> 01:47:28,148
Thank you.

1127
01:47:33,435 --> 01:47:35,336
- Kojima.
- Yes.

1128
01:47:40,631 --> 01:47:47,057
Biggest challenge is
prejudice and discrimination,

1129
01:47:47,897 --> 01:47:52,018
but I'm sure you'll make it.

1130
01:47:53,971 --> 01:47:56,688
Be happy.

1131
01:47:56,849 --> 01:47:59,318
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1132
01:48:02,257 --> 01:48:06,725
Takano. Where's he?

1133
01:48:06,959 --> 01:48:10,452
I called but, no answer.

1134
01:48:10,751 --> 01:48:13,687
Sleeping in again? Ikeyama

1135
01:48:14,391 --> 01:48:15,450
Yes.

1136
01:48:18,504 --> 01:48:21,338
You're not young,
cut down on drinking.

1137
01:48:21,741 --> 01:48:22,868
Ah, yes.

1138
01:48:23,042 --> 01:48:24,772
Going for a drink tonight?

1139
01:48:25,077 --> 01:48:27,444
- Just briefly.
- Congratulations.

1140
01:48:27,947 --> 01:48:29,506
Thank you.

1141
01:48:51,296 --> 01:48:53,060
- Kojima.
- What?

1142
01:48:53,232 --> 01:48:58,034
I'm really impressed.

1143
01:48:58,303 --> 01:49:00,397
Honestly, I thought you'd fail.

1144
01:49:01,073 --> 01:49:04,840
You were crying on the way home.

1145
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:06,876
I said we can take it...

1146
01:49:07,212 --> 01:49:09,010
together again,

1147
01:49:09,448 --> 01:49:10,780
you cried more.

1148
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:15,048
- It's all past now.
- Yes.

1149
01:49:15,487 --> 01:49:17,888
With your help,

1150
01:49:18,090 --> 01:49:20,650
I found a job and feel relieved.

1151
01:49:20,926 --> 01:49:23,589
Thank you.

1152
01:49:26,999 --> 01:49:28,399
Everyone, a toast...

1153
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:32,696
for the only lady, for Kojima.

1154
01:49:33,072 --> 01:49:36,702
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1155
01:49:42,047 --> 01:49:50,285
The red sunset on school building,

1156
01:49:50,522 --> 01:49:59,261
Cheerful voice from shade of elm,

1157
01:49:59,498 --> 01:50:07,998
High school seniors,

1158
01:50:08,362 --> 01:50:13,562
Even if we part,

1159
01:50:13,961 --> 01:50:22,554
Class friendship lasts forever.

1160
01:50:23,118 --> 01:50:25,610
Hey, something wrong?

1161
01:50:26,334 --> 01:50:29,892
- Nothing.
- Feeling okay?

1162
01:50:32,397 --> 01:50:34,389
Is it your day?

1163
01:50:36,335 --> 01:50:38,964
So hard for a woman...

1164
01:51:19,090 --> 01:51:22,106
If I'm 68, how old is mom?

1165
01:51:22,347 --> 01:51:23,542
100

1166
01:51:23,682 --> 01:51:25,480
When's your funeral?

1167
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:32,242
Someday I'll die, so when I do,
do a funeral.

1168
01:51:32,391 --> 01:51:33,916
Funeral.

1169
01:51:34,488 --> 01:51:37,457
Tommy has to do it for me,

1170
01:51:38,004 --> 01:51:40,739
you thank everyone

1171
01:51:41,229 --> 01:51:45,006
for everything they did for mom.

1172
01:51:45,137 --> 01:51:46,901
Caves in America?

1173
01:51:47,848 --> 01:51:53,378
Go to the other room,
leave mom alone.

1174
01:51:53,445 --> 01:51:55,971
If you put plaster on penis,
what happens?

1175
01:52:04,164 --> 01:52:09,694
- Hello?
- Me, Takano.

1176
01:52:12,397 --> 01:52:14,923
What happened?

1177
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:18,662
I thought you had a stroke
or something.

1178
01:52:19,037 --> 01:52:23,475
So worried. Where were you?

1179
01:52:24,209 --> 01:52:26,735
I wanted to call,

1180
01:52:26,945 --> 01:52:29,915
but didn't have the time.

1181
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:38,297
It's difficult to tell you,
my wife attempted suicide.

1182
01:52:40,825 --> 01:52:44,091
We found here,
before it was too late.

1183
01:52:45,063 --> 01:52:47,794
Her business went down,

1184
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:55,669
she was probably stressed.

1185
01:52:55,974 --> 01:52:59,138
Sorry, for ruining our date,

1186
01:52:59,544 --> 01:53:04,414
really sorry.

1187
01:53:05,649 --> 01:53:08,983
Everything is under control,

1188
01:53:09,087 --> 01:53:11,750
I'll call in a day or two.

1189
01:53:12,457 --> 01:53:15,655
We can celebrate graduation...

1190
01:53:16,181 --> 01:53:21,315
- No, we can't.
- Why?

1191
01:53:22,507 --> 01:53:25,514
Stay with her.

1192
01:53:28,716 --> 01:53:31,744
I don't know here,

1193
01:53:31,977 --> 01:53:37,177
but I know she needs you.

1194
01:53:37,655 --> 01:53:42,340
Don't ever call here.

1195
01:53:43,343 --> 01:53:47,838
Forget about me. Please.

1196
01:53:48,505 --> 01:53:56,832
Good bye,
thank you for the past 6 months.

1197
01:54:01,173 --> 01:54:03,369
Full moon and crescent moon.

1198
01:54:03,575 --> 01:54:06,135
Full moon is covered by clouds.

1199
01:54:06,445 --> 01:54:09,540
Crescent moon is covered by clouds.
I won't cry...

1200
01:54:38,727 --> 01:54:42,892
Dad, mom wants some juice.

1201
01:54:43,297 --> 01:54:48,031
Get me some sake.

1202
01:54:48,787 --> 01:54:53,088
Sake? In a hospital?

1203
01:54:53,258 --> 01:54:56,285
I'm tired.

1204
01:54:57,912 --> 01:55:00,507
Said you quit drinking,

1205
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:03,220
where's your will-power?

1206
01:55:03,362 --> 01:55:04,625
You get addicted.

1207
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:06,560
I said go get it!

1208
01:55:06,763 --> 01:55:08,629
Obey me! Go!

1209
01:56:09,101 --> 01:56:12,469
Excuse me. Bulb change.

1210
01:56:36,076 --> 01:56:39,376
Thank you. Excuse me.

1211
01:56:50,836 --> 01:56:52,134
- Kojima.
- Yes.

1212
01:56:52,650 --> 01:56:55,279
Head office called...

1213
01:56:55,461 --> 01:56:58,021
about your health check up result.

1214
01:56:58,250 --> 01:57:03,314
Call them back.

1215
01:57:05,104 --> 01:57:06,265
Okay.

1216
01:57:07,459 --> 01:57:11,021
I get called every time, my liver,

1217
01:57:12,634 --> 01:57:15,695
they always say,

1218
01:57:15,867 --> 01:57:18,803
"no alcohol, and quit smoking".

1219
01:57:20,189 --> 01:57:22,283
Building management center.

1220
01:57:22,767 --> 01:57:26,226
Yes, yes, please hold.

1221
01:57:36,552 --> 01:57:39,681
Mrs. Sawako Kojima.
Please come in.

1222
01:57:40,097 --> 01:57:40,996
Yes.

1223
01:57:53,627 --> 01:57:56,563
- I'm Dr. Ito.
- I'm Kojima.

1224
01:57:56,666 --> 01:58:00,831
Did you have a check up
for breast cancer?

1225
01:58:01,076 --> 01:58:01,736
Yes.

1226
01:58:01,865 --> 01:58:05,927
One more time. Raise your arms.

1227
01:58:10,155 --> 01:58:11,214
Thank you. Put it down.

1228
01:58:15,474 --> 01:58:19,006
This stiffness.
You never felt it?

1229
01:58:20,125 --> 01:58:21,423
No.

1230
01:58:21,736 --> 01:58:23,602
In some cases,

1231
01:58:23,702 --> 01:58:26,604
husband finds it first.

1232
01:58:27,912 --> 01:58:31,349
I don't have a husband.

1233
01:58:32,210 --> 01:58:34,372
Pardon me.

1234
01:58:42,888 --> 01:58:45,941
More tests are necessary.

1235
01:58:47,011 --> 01:58:48,108
Yes.

1236
01:58:53,632 --> 01:58:56,295
Ready in 12 minutes.

1237
01:58:56,801 --> 01:59:04,106
- 28 more seconds.
- I'm home.

1238
01:59:04,943 --> 01:59:06,912
12 more seconds.

1239
01:59:08,375 --> 01:59:11,945
Sorry I'm late.
I'll cook dinner.

1240
01:59:12,083 --> 01:59:13,984
Nikuman, nikuman.

1241
01:59:15,654 --> 01:59:17,145
You cooked nikuman?

1242
01:59:17,289 --> 01:59:21,090
- 12 minutes.
- Thanks.

1243
01:59:21,626 --> 01:59:24,289
Oh, hot. Hot! Be careful!

1244
01:59:24,796 --> 01:59:28,563
Oh, hot. Hot! Be careful!

1245
01:59:33,838 --> 01:59:35,431
Tasty nikuman.

1246
01:59:36,741 --> 01:59:38,073
Looks good.

1247
01:59:40,011 --> 01:59:43,743
Mom use mustard. I don't.
Mustard hot.

1248
02:00:07,123 --> 02:00:14,055
- Not hot.
- Steam is nice.

1249
02:00:20,002 --> 02:00:25,566
Mom has cancer, breast cancer.

1250
02:00:27,215 --> 02:00:33,382
You may not understand,
but it's serious.

1251
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:38,367
I went to the doctor.

1252
02:00:40,475 --> 02:00:45,937
He suggested me to bring my family,

1253
02:00:46,615 --> 02:00:55,456
but I told him I'm okay by myself.

1254
02:00:58,306 --> 02:01:03,438
Sorry for not taking you
as my family.

1255
02:01:10,125 --> 02:01:14,426
But mom's not scared.

1256
02:01:16,599 --> 02:01:22,769
Mom is very brave and strong.

1257
02:01:25,549 --> 02:01:31,284
Even when I found your disability,

1258
02:01:33,023 --> 02:01:38,121
dad suddenly died,

1259
02:01:39,830 --> 02:01:46,327
lost my job,
and broke up with Takano

1260
02:01:47,371 --> 02:01:53,106
I came over it.

1261
02:01:56,180 --> 02:02:01,955
Mom's okay, not scared a bit.

1262
02:02:06,990 --> 02:02:13,097
Right, no big deal.

1263
02:02:22,606 --> 02:02:27,874
Pacific Building maintenance?

1264
02:02:30,388 --> 02:02:34,621
Hi, Hashimoto. It's me, Inoue.

1265
02:02:34,889 --> 02:02:39,054
Hi. I'll be quick.

1266
02:02:39,367 --> 02:02:42,287
Our friend Kojima,
will have operation.

1267
02:02:42,522 --> 02:02:48,951
Breast cancer. She has no family,

1268
02:02:49,276 --> 02:02:57,412
so we all go,
see her and cheer her up.

1269
02:02:59,109 --> 02:03:04,446
Great. The hospital is...

1270
02:03:04,650 --> 02:03:09,145
Akabane General Hospital.

1271
02:03:09,820 --> 02:03:13,814
Breast cancer operation.

1272
02:03:14,124 --> 02:03:15,888
Poor thing.

1273
02:03:16,543 --> 02:03:23,575
We're going to see her,
and cheer her up.

1274
02:03:23,621 --> 02:03:24,452
How about you?

1275
02:03:26,737 --> 02:03:32,267
What? Next Monday, 1 o'clock, okay.

1276
02:03:33,343 --> 02:03:36,245
I'll be there.

1277
02:03:38,215 --> 02:03:41,447
I'll tell Onizuka.

1278
02:04:07,159 --> 02:04:12,723
- Auntie.
- Operating today?

1279
02:04:12,864 --> 02:04:15,026
Why didn't tell me?

1280
02:04:15,196 --> 02:04:17,722
I'm your only aunt.

1281
02:04:17,902 --> 02:04:20,462
I worry about you always.

1282
02:04:20,755 --> 02:04:22,690
I'm your family.

1283
02:04:23,073 --> 02:04:24,735
Stop crying, auntie.

1284
02:04:24,909 --> 02:04:27,401
I'm not dying.

1285
02:04:29,380 --> 02:04:34,546
You're right,
you get well after operation.

1286
02:04:34,852 --> 02:04:38,084
All well. Boobs are...

1287
02:04:38,289 --> 02:04:41,453
only important when you're young.

1288
02:04:41,659 --> 02:04:45,391
Later, they're useless.

1289
02:04:45,963 --> 02:04:48,330
When you get well,

1290
02:04:48,666 --> 02:04:51,534
I'll find you a man.

1291
02:04:51,802 --> 02:04:54,328
Who accept one boob.

1292
02:04:54,572 --> 02:04:57,041
Will there be any?

1293
02:04:57,274 --> 02:04:59,243
Yes, there will.

1294
02:05:02,913 --> 02:05:05,212
Tunnels in Denmark?

1295
02:05:06,717 --> 02:05:10,916
Tommy, you've grown.

1296
02:05:11,355 --> 02:05:13,017
When will you die?

1297
02:05:14,091 --> 02:05:15,992
How unpleasant!

1298
02:05:16,193 --> 02:05:18,822
Who'll come to your funeral?

1299
02:05:19,029 --> 02:05:23,524
Hello. Anesthesia preparation.

1300
02:05:24,401 --> 02:05:27,303
Hello doctor, I'm her aunt.

1301
02:05:27,571 --> 02:05:30,598
Please help her doctor.

1302
02:05:31,242 --> 02:05:34,872
- Lie down.
- Sleep well?

1303
02:05:35,179 --> 02:05:37,114
Probably not.

1304
02:05:37,548 --> 02:05:39,540
Taking blood pressure.

1305
02:05:42,987 --> 02:05:44,421
Consent taken?

1306
02:05:44,622 --> 02:05:46,352
Yes, confirmed.

1307
02:06:07,945 --> 02:06:10,346
Who are you?

1308
02:06:10,914 --> 02:06:15,750
We're her classmates.
We came to visit.

1309
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:20,200
- Kojima.
- Yes.

1310
02:06:21,959 --> 02:06:26,454
I can only tell you, good luck.

1311
02:06:26,964 --> 02:06:29,900
Wish I had more vocabulary.

1312
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:33,559
Now, be strong. I'm here.

1313
02:06:33,871 --> 02:06:35,134
I'm not much use.

1314
02:06:35,439 --> 02:06:36,702
Yes, you are.

1315
02:06:36,874 --> 02:06:39,537
We didn't age for nothing.

1316
02:06:39,843 --> 02:06:43,917
He's right.
You worry about nothing.

1317
02:06:45,683 --> 02:06:47,174
Thank you.

1318
02:06:52,656 --> 02:06:53,885
It's me.

1319
02:06:59,029 --> 02:07:00,190
Hello.

1320
02:07:10,307 --> 02:07:12,276
It's Cho. Hello.

1321
02:07:21,685 --> 02:07:23,017
You okay?

1322
02:07:36,589 --> 02:07:43,154
Hey, your...

1323
02:07:50,214 --> 02:07:56,381
Your wife, did she get well?

1324
02:08:05,195 --> 02:08:14,537
Good. That was worrying me. Really.

1325
02:08:50,808 --> 02:08:53,175
Kojima, snow.

1326
02:09:39,857 --> 02:09:42,827
Life passes in a blink,

1327
02:09:43,227 --> 02:09:52,830
we're just like a momentary star.

1328
02:09:53,103 --> 02:10:00,067
Without blinking,
even reluctant to breathe,

1329
02:10:00,344 --> 02:10:09,720
we want each other.

1330
02:10:12,189 --> 02:10:19,119
When are you disappearing?

1331
02:10:19,396 --> 02:10:24,699
When are you leaving me behind?

1332
02:10:24,935 --> 02:10:33,401
Where are you going without me?

1333
02:10:33,710 --> 02:10:39,616
Even if your reflecting mirror,

1334
02:10:39,917 --> 02:10:45,015
doesn't have a song to praise you.

1335
02:10:45,322 --> 02:10:50,454
I will praise you,

1336
02:10:50,694 --> 02:10:58,602
about you unknown to you.

1337
02:10:58,969 --> 02:11:06,137
That humble life...

1338
02:11:06,476 --> 02:11:11,642
may be criticized by some.

1339
02:11:11,915 --> 02:11:17,149
That humble life...

1340
02:11:17,421 --> 02:11:23,361
may be judged useless by some.

1341
02:11:23,727 --> 02:11:28,722
But I will praise you,

1342
02:11:28,932 --> 02:11:34,064
about you unknown to you.

1343
02:11:34,404 --> 02:11:44,403
People are beasts
without fangs, poison or thorn.

1344
02:11:44,715 --> 02:11:54,714
Just given tears, to be pained.

1345
02:11:55,592 --> 02:12:01,691
A naked beast.

1346
02:12:01,965 --> 02:12:06,835
I will praise you,

1347
02:12:07,070 --> 02:12:12,634
about you unknown to you.

1348
02:12:12,943 --> 02:12:15,105
Life passes in a blink,

1349
02:12:15,445 --> 02:12:22,818
we're just like a momentary star.

1350
02:12:23,020 --> 02:12:29,324
Without blinking,
even reluctant to breathe,

1351
02:12:29,726 --> 02:12:38,692
we want each other.
