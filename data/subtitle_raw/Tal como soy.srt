1
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,550
To my mother, Dolores Maldonado Capado,
and Valverde del Camino (Huelva)

2
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,836
Forty years after the entry into force
of the Spanish Constitution

3
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:48,340
To date, the transsexual collective
still pursues its social inclusion

4
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,230
Public Institutions, in order to
the United Nations Charter,

5
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:53,950
TEXT: LORENA GUZMAN

6
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,140
must prevent this scourge through
effective laws and economic supports

7
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:05,236
For many years, transgender people
were engaged in prostitution

8
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,396
The labor doors are still closed
and persecutions and attacks continue

9
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:18,900
Children can´t choose their gender
due to social pressure and taboos

10
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,860
and this makes them suffer a lot

11
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,020
They loved your project!
You're the best. Take a few days off.

12
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,460
Thank you Carlos,
maybe some other time.

13
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,446
But now I prefer to finish
some work that is pending.

14
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:11,660
As you wish. We'll reward you soon.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,900
Honey, what do you have to tell me
that is so important?

16
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,220
I've left some clients unattended.

17
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,980
Yes?

18
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:50,340
I can see it´s a boy
because of the genital organs.

19
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,836
- Do you like it?
- I love it mom.

20
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,060
- How beautiful will be my boy.
- How handsome he'll be!

21
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,980
I can´t wait to see him!
And how are you? Do you still vomit?

22
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,220
I don´t vomit anymore but he kicks me
at night and I can't sleep.

23
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,900
Oh! He´s like you!
You did the same!

24
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,460
Done!

25
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,140
Sleep, my little boy!

26
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,876
- Hello!
- Hi! I´m Pedro, your new neighbour.

27
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,820
This is a present for your baby!
Congratulations!

28
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:45,740
Oh, thank you! Please, come in.

29
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,510
- A doll? That´s not for boys, is it?
- Of course not.

30
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,310
I thought it was a girl.
Tomorrow I'll exchange it for another!

31
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,660
- Don´t worry, it´s very nice,
I'll keep it for me.

32
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,166
No! I'll change it.

33
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,460
Don´t worry!
Would you like another coffee?

34
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:28,516
Haven't you noticed something strange
about our neighbour?

35
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:34,900
- I'd say he's gay.
- Oh, come on honey.

36
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,236
-Well, and what if he's gay?

37
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:46,260
- I don´t want strange things
around our son. Maybe he's a problem.

38
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:53,620
-Oh, really? What kind of things?

39
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,100
THREE YEARS LATER

40
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,460
You are lovely, handsome.

41
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,636
-Handsome? Beautiful.

42
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,180
Have you heard that, love?
He said: not handsome, beautiful.

43
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,620
He said beautiful to you!

44
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,960
And what are you?
Handsome or beautiful?

45
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,560
Beautiful.

46
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,116
Handsome or beautiful?

47
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,140
Beautiful.

48
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,396
It´s time to go to bed.
Come on, sweethearts.

49
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,260
- Let´s go?
- Let´s go.

50
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,020
FIVE YEARS LATER

51
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:17,460
One, two and three. Boys to the right
and girls to the left.

52
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:28,100
Let´s go, 1... 2... and... 3!

53
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,860
Adam? What happens?

54
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:03,420
Choose one costume and get ready.
Come on, Adam.

55
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,420
Play with it.

56
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:40,260
When I grow up I'll be like you
and have the hair as long as you.

57
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:48,990
Oh yes? My little boy...
Don't get so angry.

58
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,540
Why don´t you play with someone? Gay!

59
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:30,620
Let me see that face! Oh, what a boy!

60
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:44,940
- How handsome you're. I love you!
- Me too, grandma!

61
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,100
Mom, why do you let
the kid do these nonsenses?

62
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,286
What nonsenses? Is this bad?

63
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,646
Take out that clothes,
you look like a clown.

64
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,966
Oh my god,
you are worst than you father!

65
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,660
What a girl, she´s young but...

66
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,380
Honey, are you okay?

67
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,780
Mummy, daddy, I´m a girl, don´t you see it?

68
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,820
Oh baby,
it´s a nightmare, don´t worry.

69
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,020
When am I going to be
who I really am?

70
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:58,500
- Come here, baby.
- Come, superhero.

71
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:37,780
- It's time for mental calculus. Ready?
- Yes!

72
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,380
If I have 25 sweets and I eat 15,
how many sweets are left?

73
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,220
- 15 sweets.
- Yes! Right!

74
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:04,780
I have 100 euros and spend 80.
How many are left Adriana?

75
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:17,460
- 20 euros.
- Right, very good.

76
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,900
Page 25 guys...

77
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,020
Adam, come here, let´s play.

78
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:52,940
Hello! Look Adam,
this is for your costume party!

79
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,256
- It´s a prince costume!
- It´s beautiful.

80
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,340
I don´t like it, I want a princess costume.

81
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:19,900
- Princess? Don´t talk nonsense!
- If he wants to be an actor...

82
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:29,620
He´s always with the same thing...
What´s wrong with this costume?

83
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,620
- I don´t like it.
- And which one do you want?

84
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,780
- Alberto, you're spoiling the boy.
You'll wear this costume!

85
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:49,900
We're leaving now,
so much nonsense about princess.

86
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:15,180
We demand to remove transsexuality
from mental illness manuals

87
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:23,620
and the right for trans people
to change their name on official documents

88
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:31,140
We concentrate after
the aggression to Lorena,

89
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,436
an act that incites hatred of diversity,

90
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,646
and that is why today we claim our rights.

91
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,236
We want the free
development of trans minors

92
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:55,300
their free self-determination
and choice of gender.

93
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,340
Silence is complicity.

94
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:11,340
For the rights of transsexuals!

95
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,636
For the rights of transsexuals!

96
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:24,660
Also the difficulty of
trans people to find a job.

97
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,876
We demand new policies to end

98
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,316
We demand new policies to end the 
marginalization and discrimination.

99
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:40,704
We want to highlight the murders,
assaults and suicides

100
00:14:40,728 --> 00:14:45,636
suffered by trans
people and their families.

101
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,540
And we point to the system as guilty.

102
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:25,180
You are so girly, you are a shame.

103
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,300
It´s enough, leave him alone!

104
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,900
What happens?

105
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:59,580
Children shouldn't be taken into account.
They change their minds quickly.

106
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,500
As a religion teacher,
I'll say children must be limited.

107
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,340
We can't let them do what they want to.

108
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,280
Adam, is in a difficult period.

109
00:17:14,304 --> 00:17:20,196
Do not buy him girls things,
he´s not a girl.

110
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,260
You'll see he'll soon pass the whim.

111
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,860
- How did you get him that costume?
- I did, there's nothing more to talk about.

112
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,980
- You could have told me.
- We are not perfect. I made a mistake.

113
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:15,060
Adam, what happens?
Don´t you go to the toilet?

114
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:33,060
Adam is a complicated kid.
I don't know what's wrong with him.

115
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,740
I've never met a case like this
and I don't know what to do.

116
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:46,940
Sometimes the behavior of children
is due to problems at home.

117
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,060
There is no problem
that can affect him.

118
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:57,620
We'll make him an attention deficit test.

119
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,396
If you think it´s okay.

120
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,996
We´ll call you to sign the papers.

121
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:14,660
More things:
this drawing is from your son...

122
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:43,676
I have a lot of work tomorrow,
I will arrive late...

123
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,436
I waited for you at school today.
I'm having all the problems on my own.

124
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,356
Are you're saying
I don't care about my family?

125
00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:00,596
You know what it's like to be
showing houses all day to earn a living.

126
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:07,580
You're so calm in your office.

127
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,196
Mommy, you have to ask me
the multiplication tables.

128
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:26,060
You study that at school!
Go to bed, I'm fed up with you.

129
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,636
I've finished my homework.
Am I handsome, eh?

130
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:40,180
I´m tired of this...
You are big enough for these games.

131
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,380
Adam!

132
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,220
Adam!

133
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:45,140
Mommy, girls don´t have a pennis,
cut it please...

134
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:41,686
- Was it an accident?
- I´ve been beaten up...

135
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:46,020
- Why?
- Because I´m a trans person.

136
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:55,260
There're still people who don't understand
we live in another world.

137
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,380
Rosa, you can go in.

138
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:22,420
We've done several
medical tests and it's all right.

139
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,060
So, your son is very healthy.

140
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,980
-Rosa. -Hello Carlos.

141
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,020
You haven't come two
days and your phone's off.

142
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,700
What's the matter with you?

143
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:54,500
- I took Adam to the doctor.
- What about the Germans' project?

144
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,000
- I'll have it at the end of the day.
- I hope so.

145
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:47,728
I never wanted to wear girl's clothes,
nor to be a woman

146
00:25:47,752 --> 00:25:50,620
I'm happy being a man.

147
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:59,620
What if your son is a transsexual?

148
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:19,380
Good night, I'm Sam the Giant.

149
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:26,900
I'm going to sing
a Spanish song called the Trinidad!

150
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,916
I stop because I want to

151
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:53,100
because the Spanish singers
have been shitting it for 40 years

152
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,126
saying Murillo and Rafael
and as a well-educated transsexual

153
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:04,900
in the Seville's Museum there's not
a single painting of Rafael

154
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,100
there's Juan de Valdés Leal,
so the song is

155
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,460
Right or not? How serious!

156
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:20,860
I´m singing culture
and people go out.

157
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:29,980
I´m explaining very well
the Valdés Leal thing.

158
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:38,556
Adam's case is complicated,
he's small but has clear his ideas.

159
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:44,076
We have to understand
that this can change as years go by.

160
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:51,156
You don't have to worry
and let him live as he feels.

161
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:59,180
Let´s meet in three months
to see his progress.

162
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,180
Honey, we are at home.

163
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:02,700
- What are all those clothes?
- Didn't you hear the psychologist?

164
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:19,660
Remember when you said
the most important was his happiness?

165
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,076
I love myself the way I am, as a man.

166
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:18,196
I'm not gay, but artistically
I dress as a woman.

167
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,180
I've been doing it since I was a kid
because it frees me up.

168
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:30,700
I don't dress up like a woman
everyday, just in occasional cases.

169
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,340
Silvia! One beer please.

170
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,820
Ana, do you think we're doing well?

171
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,740
Ana, if you see how happy he's
when she says she's Sophia.

172
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:15,820
That's not the case,
your son has a mental illness.

173
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:21,850
You have to get him
to a psychiatrist as soon as possible.

174
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,500
I know some very good ones.

175
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,220
Adam is a healthy boy.

176
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,540
The only problem
he's got is in his head.

177
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,780
You mustn't play along
because you're only hurting him.

178
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:49,220
Adam was born boy and what God creates
cannot be altered by man at his whim.

179
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,700
Do you want him to be
the school laughing boy?

180
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,620
Making fun of him all day?

181
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,220
You've lost your mind.

182
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:45,700
Alberto, how's it going?

183
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,180
I thought all this was going to be
a game, a passing joke...

184
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,060
but the situation is beyond me.

185
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,540
I've always had
everything under control

186
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:09,660
but I feel like I'm hitting a wall.

187
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,780
I just want everything to be normal.

188
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:23,700
I know,
but what's really normal, Alberto?

189
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,130
I want to know, too.

190
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,340
I want you to know
that I love my son very much.

191
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,820
I'm sure of that.

192
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,060
- Alberto Martinez!
- One second please!

193
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:49,220
Calm down.
Everything will be okay, darling.

194
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:55,940
You'll see everything will be okay.

195
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:04,020
He's out of gravity, he's bruising
but we don't care about it.

196
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,186
He's got a corneal tear,
his eyes'll be blindfolded

197
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,876
We´ll see how he evolves.

198
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,060
Can we see him?

199
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:19,140
He's sedated, you'll be able
to see him in half an hour.

200
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,980
Okay, thank you.

201
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:30,380
Don't cry, darling.

202
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:37,540
- Hi, daddy. I'm Sophia.
- Sophia?

203
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,460
- Sophia, your daughter!
- Have I got a daughter?

204
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,540
I can't remember,
I have a headache.

205
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,420
Honey, give dad a kiss
and let's get him rest.

206
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:06,060
I SAW A LIGHT SHINING,
I SAW MYSELF BEHIND, JUST AS I AM

207
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:15,370
LISTEN DAD, TAKE MY HAND,
YOU CAN SEE, EVEN IF YOU'RE BANDAGED

208
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:26,740
LOVE IS THE LIGHT
AND THERE IS NO NEED TO FEAR

209
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:36,680
EVEN THOUGH I'M DIFFERENT,
EVEN THOUGH I'M DIFFERENT...

210
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:45,980
LOVE IS THE LIGHT
AND THERE IS NO NEED TO FEAR

211
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:55,740
EVEN THOUGH I'M DIFFERENT,
EVEN THOUGH I'M DIFFERENT...

212
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:16,220
I SAW THE SUN RISE,
I SAW THE SUNRISE, WITH A HOPE

213
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,460
LISTEN, MOM, STAY BY MY SIDE

214
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:27,540
YOU KNOW WELL WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME

215
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:36,460
LOVE IS THE LIGHT
AND THERE IS NO NEED TO FEAR

216
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,580
Go with dad, he's alone downstairs.

217
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:56,900
- Daddy, do you know who I am?
- Of course, honey.

218
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:04,740
AND EVEN IF THE MOON COMES UP
AND I CAN´T SEE YOU...

219
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,010
YOU LIGHT MY WAY

220
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:19,500
OH, YOU LIGHT MY WAY

221
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:28,340
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY LIFE
AND I´M LUCKY TO HAVE YOU

222
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:42,940
- What about transgender kids?
- Transgender kids know they are kids.

223
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,380
Like any other children,
they know that they are children.

224
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,860
The problem comes when what they are
faces what people say they are.

225
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:58,940
- And could this be a whim?
- No, it's not a whim, Rosa.

226
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,540
Transsexuality is not a choice,
you can't chose your sexual identity.

227
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,820
- Isn't it a disease either?
- No. That's why there is no treatment.

228
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:13,940
Each one is as he/she is and
each one is what he/she really feels.

229
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:20,300
If you really want to help Lucy,
you have to understand these issues.

230
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,916
Because that's important
to be able to help her in her process.

231
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,896
Now I want you to come with me
to see the place,

232
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:34,940
to get know about the dynamics
and to meet some transsexual families.

233
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,540
It was hard to assimilate what I was
'cause I didn't understand that world.

234
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,940
And I used to say my mum:
"I don't want to have that there."

235
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:53,700
I took the scissors. I didn't want...
I didn't feel as a boy.

236
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:59,900
I was always with girls and
I couldn't understand what I was.

237
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,780
When getting older, little by little
I understood what I was.

238
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,340
I was prescribed hormones
and I started with the treatment.

239
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:21,300
And it's a change very...
I feel really good now.

240
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:30,200
I know that he had a really hard time
and society is not ready for this.

241
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:39,900
It's hard, but she is happy.
And that's the most important.

242
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:48,980
And I get excited because she's now
what she really wanted to be.

243
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,580
You have to support her.
Even if you don't understand her.

244
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:07,420
Speak with her.
You'll understand her.

245
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:13,100
It'll be hard,
because you had a boy and now...

246
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,140
It's hard but you want
her happiness, don't you?

247
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,860
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen years old.

248
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:24,380
And, as you can see,
he's now very self-confident.

249
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:31,820
It's a great advance. He is very shy,
but as any child or adolescent can be.

250
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,676
To tell you the truth,
I see him very different.

251
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:43,460
I've lived a repressed transsexuality.
I didn't know what was wrong with me.

252
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:00,796
Until one day that I said it at home
because I couldn't stand it anymore.

253
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,046
I've suffered job discrimination.

254
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,820
I don't have the same opportunities
because I'm a transgender.

255
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:15,020
LIVE THE LIFE, LIVE THE LIFE

256
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:23,450
LIVE THE LIFE, LIVE THE LIFE,

257
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:31,260
LIVE THE LIFE, LIVE THE LIFE,

258
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,500
And what shall we do now, Albert?

259
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,500
I'm very afraid about
what could happen to our son.

260
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,710
I'm afraid he might live
a lonely and miserable life.

261
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,480
I have a feeling whatever we'll do
we're going to do wrong.

262
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,660
Call your parents and your sister
and tell them to come.

263
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:37,020
It's eleven at night! Are you crazy?

264
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,500
It doesn't matter, call them.
Hurry up!

265
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:55,580
MY SOPHIE IS HAPPY, MY SOPHIE IS HAPPY,

266
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:03,240
MY SOPHIE IS HAPPY, MY SOPHIE IS HAPPY,

267
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,260
- That's great!
- How happy she is!

268
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,940
- Grandma blows you a kiss.
- Muah!

269
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,100
Mommy, daddy,
today's been the best day of my life.

270
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:05,300
Little Adam, I carried you
for nine months in my womb,

271
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,620
you were born
and became the joy of the house.

272
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:14,740
But you started growing up
and your face stopped smiling.

273
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:20,740
I felt like a bad mother because
I was failing at something with you.

274
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,620
And I didn't know what it was.

275
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:30,180
Today, Adam, I want to say godbye
to you. Oh my god, I can't.

276
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:34,420
How hard it is!
Even though I know you're not anymore

277
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,420
and that you've never really been.

278
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:42,056
I cradled you, dressed you,
named you and loved you

279
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,880
like that beautiful child
I thought you were.

280
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:50,260
How difficult it is, Adam.
I'm trying to say goodbye to you

281
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:56,380
even though I'm seeing next to me
a beautiful girl named Sophia,

282
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,140
a girl who gives off the joy
that you should.

283
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:07,580
My little Adam, I want to tell you
that you'll always be in my heart.

284
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,060
Though my mind knows
you've never existed,

285
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,940
We are at life just to pass through
and to be happy.

286
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:48,180
Ok, we are now going to start
the project in the nature classroom.

287
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:53,820
But first, one question: what are
the human beings' vital functions?

288
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,740
- Who do I throw the ball at?
- Me!

289
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:05,020
Sophia! Take the ball.

290
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:09,020
Function of nutrition,
interaction and reproduction.

291
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:13,380
-Very good, right answer! -Very good.

292
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:21,100
Come on, start the research work.

293
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:25,876
This is for you. And you, let me see.
Ok, very good.

294
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:29,006
AMERICAN GUN, AMERICAN GUN,
IN, OUT, TURN AND JUMP

295
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:30,030
Once again.

296
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:34,940
AMERICAN GUN, AMERICAN GUN,
IN, OUT, TURN AND JUMP

297
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:40,660
AMERICAN GUN, AMERICAN GUN,
IN, OUT, TURN AND JUMP

298
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,836
You're a boy.
You will never be a girl.

299
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:15,140
You're annoying God
and he's going to punish you.

300
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:19,780
God loves me very much
because I'm very happy.

301
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:26,700
- We're going to the director!
- No! You're a bad person!

302
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:52,580
I just want that everything is normal.
He can come as a boy, as usual.

303
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:58,420
Why haven't they ask us and listen
before dressing him as a girl?

304
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:18,980
These parents are feminizing their son
and that's really serious.

305
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:26,660
I just want him to dress as a boy
inside the school.

306
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,860
Outside the school, he can dress
like he wants and do what he wants.

307
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:37,220
You can't turn a school and its values
upside down for a childish whim.

308
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,380
In my personal opinion,
these parents want to attract attention

309
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:45,460
and they are damaging the good climate
of coexistence of this centre.

310
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:53,296
I'm going to tell you
something that people

311
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,100
who know really well
these parents have told me:

312
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:00,300
These parents wanted to have
a girl instead of a boy.

313
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,680
Everything that is happening
is a whim of them

314
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:10,100
and they also want to design
their son's sexuality.

315
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,300
It doesn't surprise me, it's crazy.

316
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:20,940
And all they're getting is
our kids coming to school scared.

317
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:31,180
Despite all the nonsense I'm hearing,
I understand your concern

318
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:35,310
and that you're not prepared for this,
because we weren't either.

319
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:38,540
Now we're proud and happy
to have Sophia.

320
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:43,476
Sophia is a girl as yours
and we have to help her

321
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,100
to obtain the same rights
that your children have

322
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,560
and my daughter doesn't have yet.

323
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,260
- Your son is very dear to this school.
- Daughter!

324
00:56:55,020 --> 00:57:01,460
I reject any kind of discrimination
but I will not allow my son

325
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:06,516
to be used as a guinea pig
in an integration experiment

326
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:06,637
that is not supported by medical,
psychological or judicial documents.
to be used as a guinea pig
in an integration experiment

327
00:57:06,661 --> 00:57:11,210
that is not supported by medical,
psychological or judicial documents.

328
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,976
- We've had enough,
so let's get out of here.

329
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,900
- Yes.
- These people are all scoundrels.

330
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:21,500
You are all wrong.

331
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,876
I've prepared a document
to be submitted

332
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,740
to the Board of Directors
and the Inspection.

333
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,340
If you want to, you can
come and sign it.

334
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:14,540
- What's that? A boy or a girl?
- I don't know.

335
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,940
Don't you know
that sex is in the brain?

336
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,300
My mother says that it's a monster.

337
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,620
We are all humans.

338
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,316
Auntie, has it been many years
since you've been on a swing?

339
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:05,357
-Many. -A lot of them.
Auntie, has it been many years
since you've been on a swing?

340
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:09,700
-Many. -A lot of them.

341
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,500
Go hard! Now.

342
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:18,940
-How's school going, Sophia?

343
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:23,060
Very well auntie,
I'm getting very good marks.

344
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:29,540
Great! Do you want us
to go to the casino to see Grandpa?

345
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,500
Ok!

346
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:39,900
- Four.
- Three, it's three.

347
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,160
I'll be right back.

348
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:09,180
- Where is my grandfather Francisco?
- Who are you?

349
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,500
I'm Sophia, his granddaughter.

350
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,340
But Francisco didn't have
any granddaughters.

351
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:29,300
- I think he has a grandson.
- When he comes, ask him.

352
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,780
It seems to me
that it was a boy, doesn't it?

353
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:36,340
- I don't know Paco.
- It was a boy.

354
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:52,060
Francisco, your granddaughter
has come looking for you.

355
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,900
My granddaughter? What granddaughter?

356
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:56,740
Yes, a little girl has come asking
for her grandfather Francisco.

357
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,580
I don't have any granddaughter,
I just have two grandsons.

358
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:03,380
- I told it to you.
- But didn't Francisco have a...?

359
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:07,140
Francisco have a grandson,
not a granddaughter, ok?

360
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:11,540
Come on, let's continue.

361
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,300
You're my grandfather
and you're ashamed of me.

362
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:29,116
I'm a girl, your granddaughter Sophia.

363
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:35,020
And listen to this: I won't talk
to you again until you call me Sophia.

364
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:35,300
Carlos, I've finished the project
you asked me for. Look, I'll show you.

365
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,260
I come from a meeting
with the board of directors.

366
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:40,860
I don't like to tell you this but

367
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,900
we've decided that
you won't continue working with us.

368
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:49,300
-What?! -You're the best in the company but

369
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:53,460
your family situation
doesn't favor the company's policy.

370
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:06,180
Do you know what? My family situation
has helped me to know

371
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:10,860
which things are important in life
and who really worthwhile.

372
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:14,940
I'll come tomorrow
to pick up my stuff.

373
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:31,380
We've received a letter
parents of the school.

374
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:37,790
We have done as much as we could and more.

375
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:44,060
We've authorized him to come dressed
as a girl, to enter the girls toilet,

376
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:50,966
but we think we don't have to give
any more explanations at school

377
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:58,990
and even less to parents,
who are free to think what they want.

378
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:01,020
And they know what they want!

379
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:05,756
I have to recognize
that this situation

380
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:09,020
causes many problems to the school.

381
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:15,860
We're not prepared to face
problems like your son's.

382
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,740
Daughter! It's a girl
and her name is Sophia!

383
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:26,780
Sorry. We've decided that from now on
she cannot use the girls toilet.

384
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,860
- What?!
- Then, what toilet can she go into?

385
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:37,260
Don't worry, she can use the sink
in the toilet for her bowel movements.

386
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,980
No way! My daughter has
the same rights as everyone else,

387
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:42,620
so we're going to file a complaint
right now at the inspection.

388
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:48,500
You should maybe consider changing her
to a school where no one knows her.

389
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:51,220
Are we assassins, terrorists
or something else?

390
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:54,940
I've already spoken
with the director of a public school

391
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,460
and he totally agrees with the change.

392
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:06,820
Hi, honey! How was
your first day at the new school?

393
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:14,940
Very good, daddy. I'm very happy.
Mi teacher is very nice.

394
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:23,980
I love being with my classmates
and I've been made captain of a team.

395
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:46,540
- A communion with only two girls?
- What an outrage, God!

396
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,540
What are you doing, faggot?!

397
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:06,180
Hurry up, Sophia! You're going to be
late on your first date of institute!

398
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:15,300
My little girl,
you're already a little woman!

399
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,980
-Hello. -I'm Julia.

400
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:48,060
Hello, nice to meet you.
- Hello! Nice to meet you too.

401
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

402
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:02,396
My name is Rosa Gómez and this year
I'm going to be your biology teacher.

403
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:04,356
Let's not waste any more time.

404
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:07,076
I'm going to do a roll call
to get to know you better.

405
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:08,980
-Maite Álvarez? -Me.

406
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,460
-Julia Díaz? -Me.

407
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,500
-Daniela Fernández? -Me.

408
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:18,980
-Sara López? -Me.

409
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:27,420
Adam Martínez? Adam Martínez?
Hasn't Adam Martínez come?

410
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:29,700
Hasn't he come today?

411
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:39,100
Excuse me.

412
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:12,510
Sophia! Darling, they've called
from the institute.

413
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:13,940
I know what happened to you!

414
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,740
The teacher was new
and didn't realize it!

415
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:21,850
You can't give up! You have to fight!

416
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:27,420
To fight? I don't want to fight,
just to live in peace!

417
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:31,940
What do they need
to realize that I'm a woman?

418
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:35,940
How long does it take
to get my new ID card?

419
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:39,100
Hello, miss.
Could you give me your ID card?

420
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,740
Oh, your name is Adam.
There must be some mistake.

421
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,660
Yes, there is a mistake and it is
this society where we live in.

422
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:52,340
Indicating the characteristics
of each group of micro-organisms.

423
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:56,940
This is worth one point and a half.
Also, mention two differences...

424
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:19,820
- This isn't going to be in the exam.
- I think not.

425
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:22,860
I can see your package!

426
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,220
Come on, Sophia! We're late!

427
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,860
No!

428
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,780
Hi Sophia! How are you, darling?

429
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:30,700
I don't know. I'm afraid
the treatment won't go well.

430
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:33,900
You've just started a hormonal process

431
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,660
and you're very insecure now
about what could happen.

432
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,620
But this is a process
and it take time.

433
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:49,220
So don't worry. Everything's gonna
be fine little by little.

434
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:30,260
Do Adam have tits?

435
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:38,300
Do you want to see them?

436
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:51,950
Leave her alone! Go away!

437
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,700
Are you okay?

438
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:52,260
I forgot to tell you before.
Thanks for your help.

439
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:54,296
That's what classmates are for.

440
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:57,180
I suppose you mean good classmates,
not everyone is like you.

441
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:01,100
I really like you
even I don't know you.

442
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:03,140
And I still don't even know your name.

443
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:13,276
When I look at you,
I feel like I've met you before.

444
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:14,980
I have to tell you something.

445
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,280
You're so serious!
Do you have any secrets?

446
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,740
I'm Raúl.

447
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:25,620
Which Raúl?

448
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:37,130
- Your classmate.
- That monster who was all day...?

449
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:40,896
-Yes, that one. -I have to go.

450
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,700
-Wait. -I'm in a big hurry.

451
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:24,660
Sophia, please forgive me.

452
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:29,720
I know that I hurt you so much,
but I've changed. I promise you.

453
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:38,620
I'm totally different
and I really want to be with you.

454
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:44,620
Just think about it, ok?

455
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:40,740
- I'm going out.
- Where do you go so gorgeous?

456
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,736
- I'm going to a concert with a friend.
- That's nice!

457
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,820
- Are you sure she's a friend?
- Of course.

458
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:48,860
Well, okay. But if it's a boy
I have to meet him.

459
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:50,260
What things you say!

460
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:04,060
Sophia! Is it true what your father
says about a boy that you like?

461
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:09,020
No, how tiresome you are!

462
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,020
I'm very proud of our daughter.

463
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:23,980
Hey, do you want to play for a while?

464
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,410
Yoo-hoo!

465
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:45,100
Hey! You're so beautiful today.
What do you have? A date?

466
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:48,580
With your Prince Charming, right?

467
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:55,020
Listen: you are not a real woman
like me. I was born woman.

468
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:58,060
- Hey! Do you want
to have a drink with us?

469
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:00,900
-No, thanks Maite, some other time.

470
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,300
Are you coming inside?

471
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:10,540
- No, go ahead.
- Okay!

472
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:15,196
- Are you alone?
- Yes, but I'm waiting for a friend.

473
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:18,780
Aah. Then I'll see you inside now.

474
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:47,336
I was really looking forward
to this moment

475
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,420
and I want to introduce
my new single now,

476
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:51,540
which I dedicate,
of course, to my fan club.

477
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:14,620
I NO LONGER KNOW WHAT I FEEL FOR YOU

478
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:19,300
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN MY HEART

479
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:24,140
UH-HUH, FEEL IT

480
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:28,340
I WANT TO BE ALWAYS BY YOUR SIDE

481
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:33,260
I THINK ABOUT YOU
I FEEL YOU'RE ESPECIAL

482
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:37,220
MY OTHER HALF

483
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:44,460
HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO SCREAM
THAT I CAN'T FORGET YOU?

484
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:51,860
YOU KNOW I'M WILLING TO WAIT FOR YOU

485
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:55,580
I AM CRAZY
BECAUSE WITHOUT YOU I AM NOT MYSELF

486
01:22:55,820 --> 01:23:01,180
SO LONG
LOOKING FOR YOU IN MY SOLITUDE

487
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:05,140
IN MY SOLITUDE

488
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:09,340
I WON'T GIVE UP WHATEVER IT TAKES

489
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:14,500
I KNOW YOU LIGHT MY DAWN

490
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:19,460
HEY, LOOK AT ME

491
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:26,176
HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO SCREAM
THAT I CAN'T FORGET YOU?

492
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:33,406
YOU KNOW I'M WILLING TO WAIT FOR YOU

493
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:38,260
YOU ARE EVERYTHING I ALWAYS DREAMED OF

494
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,110
YOU'RE PART OF ME

495
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:44,500
AND I KNOW
THAT MY DESTINY IS IN YOUR SKIN

496
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:47,646
YOU ARE MY LOVE

497
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:52,000
YOU CHANGE EVERYTHING INSIDE ME

498
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:55,230
WHEN THE SUN SPLITS IN HALF

499
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:58,380
WHEN NOTHING'S COLORED

500
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:04,660
YOU ARE MY LOVE

501
01:24:04,990 --> 01:24:11,420
YOU ARE MY LOVE

502
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:20,740
HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO SCREAM
THAT I CAN'T FORGET YOU?

503
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:27,980
YOU KNOW I'M WILLING TO WAIT FOR YOU

504
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:44,180
Come with me, Raúl.
I have to tell you something.

505
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:57,580
YOU ARE MY LOVE

506
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:39,900
Raul, I didn't know you were a sissy.

507
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:43,620
You like guys.

508
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:48,196
What are you saying?
I don't like guys.

509
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:50,743
You were dancing with a guy.

510
01:25:50,767 --> 01:25:56,420
Dressed like a woman but with a good penis.

511
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:05,500
- She's not my girlfriend,
I'd be nasty to be with her.

512
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:57,676
Sophia, what I told you before
is not what I really feel.

513
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:59,462
I can't stand it anymore.

514
01:26:59,486 --> 01:27:06,060
Don't do anything crazy.
Think about your family.

515
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:08,676
I can´t stand it anymore.

516
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:16,700
When you ignore those who laugh at
you in class, you taught everyone a lesson.

517
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,276
You're the bravest person I know.

518
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:29,300
Trust me, when we're together,
I don't care about anyone else.

519
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:57,716
We're going to practice
with PCES questions.

520
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:59,636
Let´s start.

521
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:04,476
Factors influencing enematic activity...
Who knows it?

522
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:07,596
Julia.

523
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:12,516
Inhibitors, temperature and Ph.

524
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:18,220
Names of bacteriophage life cycles...

525
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:35,836
- Lithium cycle and bisogenic cycle.
- Very good, Sophia.

526
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:41,860
- Phases of mitosis.
- Me!

527
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:51,596
You have to stop seeing that person
The whole world will point at you.

528
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:58,116
You're going to ruin your life
because of a whim of youth.

529
01:28:58,140 --> 01:29:02,836
If you keep this up,
we will have to leave town.

530
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:10,116
Raúl, I forbid you to see Adam
or whatever his name is now.

531
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:13,260
Raúl! Raúl!

532
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:34,836
Did you get it?

533
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:39,476
More or less,
I look at it later at home, it's late.

534
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:45,540
- Ok! I can lend you my notes!
- Okay.

535
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:26,676
Hey, nothing, let it go.

536
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:29,956
Are you okey, Raúl?

537
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:37,860
- I came to talk to you.
- Of course, come up with me.

538
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:45,316
What happens?

539
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:47,420
I'm in love with Sophia.

540
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:55,500
We're doing very well
but I sometimes wonder what I am.

541
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:57,796
Do you understand me?

542
01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:01,796
Yes and I know
you're questioning your identity.

543
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:09,820
But it's not a matter of labels,
it's a matter of feelings.

544
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:16,796
You're a great person because
you learned to value diversity.

545
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:22,460
That's why you fell in love
with Sophia. Calm down.

546
01:33:57,580 --> 01:34:02,140
The best is
not to think more about that.

547
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:05,500
I already suffered a lot
when your father left us,

548
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:07,700
don't make me suffer again.

549
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:16,060
Your grandparents
really want to see you.

550
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:23,180
The number is not...

551
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:40,796
We're on the air in "Contigo a Diario"...

552
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:42,956
The most awaited moment has arrived...

553
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:50,980
We´re going to give the name of
the best student of this year...

554
01:35:57,100 --> 01:36:04,916
The Director will give the details,
Castillo Ruiz...

555
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:11,076
I am the Director of
the Lebrija High School.

556
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:14,916
When I finish high school,
I want to study nursing.

557
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:22,940
- I'm Sophia Martinez,
I want to study biotechnology.

558
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:31,396
It's time to know who's the best student...

559
01:36:31,420 --> 01:36:39,340
The lucky one, it's Sophia Martinez.

560
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:48,436
Let's hear it for Sophia!

561
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:50,436
Congratulations!

562
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:53,436
Congratulations Sophia!

563
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:55,956
Do you want to say something?

564
01:36:55,980 --> 01:37:00,756
To be honest,
I don't like to take part in any contest.

565
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:05,036
I will gladly represent
our High School.

566
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:09,356
I would like to send a hug
to my classmates, who also deserve it.

567
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:15,340
I'll end by saying that I'm very proud
of being a transsexual girl.

568
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:20,531
The world will be better
when we accept ourselves

569
01:37:20,555 --> 01:37:23,500
and we accept individual diversities.

570
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:30,580
Transsexual people
are like everyone else.

571
01:37:56,380 --> 01:38:00,540
- What are you doing?
- It´s a surprise, trust me.

572
