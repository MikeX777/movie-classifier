You haven't had company in this house
since Mom died eight years ago.

718
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,600
Right. Now we're gonna
have company again.

LUCY: Michael, Max is coming to dinner.
I'd like you to meet him.

720
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,900
I can't. I have plans.

721
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,300
Michael...

722
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,300
Things will change around this house
when school starts.

723

Hey...

724
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,500
MAX: How you doing?
You must be Michael, right?

725
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,100
And you must be Max.

726
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,800
Right. How are you?

727
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,500
Well, you're the man of the house...

728
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,000
...and I'm not coming in until you invite me.

729
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,400
You're invited.

730
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,900

MAX: Hello.

732
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,700
LUCY: Oh, hi. I didn't hear you come in.

733
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,600
MAX: Is it okay for the guest
to see the food before dinner?

734
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,300
You're thinking of the groom
not seeing the bride before the wedding.

735
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,000
Oh, yeah. I always get those confused.

736
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,500
MAX: Thorn sends his apologies.

737
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,400
Tell him I'm walking again.

SAM: Mom?

741
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,000
These are my dinner guests.

742
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,300
Edgar and Alan. The Frog brothers.

743
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,600
I didn't know you were having guests.

744
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,200
If we'll be in your way, we can eat
some peanut butter in the kitchen.

745
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,400
No, no, there's plenty for everybody.

746
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,000
Max, this is my son, Sam,
and Edgar and Alan... Frog?

LUCY: Boy! Somebody around here
has bad breath!

752
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,200
LUCY: Nanook, would you quit
breathing on me!

753
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,300
Nanook, get upstairs. Go on.

You want some Parmesan cheese on that?

MAX: A budding chef in the family.

759
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,000
Are you all right?

760
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:46,000
It's not cheese, it's garlic.

761
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,800
You hate garlic, don't you?

762
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,800
No, I like garlic. It's just too much...

763
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,800
It's raw garlic.

764
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,700
Garlic? How did that happen?

765
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,400

Does it burn?

Burn? Are you nuts?

And your pants.

772

777
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,300
Aah...!

778
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,000
Sam! What's gotten into you tonight?

779
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,300
I think I know what's going on here.

780
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,400
You do?

781
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,000
MAX: Yeah.

782
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,000
I know what you're thinking, Sam.
But you're wrong.

783
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,300
- I am?
- Yeah.

784

I'm not trying to replace your father...

785

That's all.

787
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,800
Good night, Lucy.

Our batting average isn't terrific, is it?
Zero for two.

You were so sweet to him.

794
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,600
I don't know what got into him.
He's not like that.

795
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,300
Kids Sam's age need discipline,
otherwise they run all over you.
