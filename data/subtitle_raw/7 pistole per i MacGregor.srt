00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:28,243
<i> He can get you out of me whenever
dead whiskey Harold MacGREGOR! </ i></i>

2
00:00:28,244 --> 00:00:32,297
<i> If there exists a hoþ of whiskey,
that you're you, Alastair MacGREGOR! </ i></i>

3
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,924
<i> See how you talk! Nobody has said
ever think of MacGREGOR's hoþ! </ i></i>

4
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:40,451
<i>With  better!
I have the pleasure of being first! </ I></i>

5
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:04,829
What you saw?

6
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,545
- 200 head.
- Why?

7
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:10,505
Some horses minunaþi.

8
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:15,116
And in the home are only few old people.

9
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,776
Let's go!

10
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,983
Veniþi with me after all!
Haideþi!

11
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,907
Bonjour and Welcome!

12
00:01:37,908 --> 00:01:40,652
I think you are însetaþi.
Want a little water?

13
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:44,697
Thanks, Mama, but do not want water.
We want the horses yourself.

14
00:01:44,698 --> 00:01:47,451
But we sell horses at the fair animals.

15
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:53,392
The thing is that ... we do not want
I bought. We want to take.

16
00:01:53,393 --> 00:01:56,311
Well, about this need to talk
soþul with me.

17
00:01:56,312 --> 00:02:00,351
Harold!
I seek some hoþi horse!

18
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:04,692
Just a moment, please.
Coming.

19
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,987
Whiskey and glory!
Hooray for MacGREGOR!

20
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,819
Whiskey and glory!
Hooray for MacGREGOR!

21
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,820
Hooray!

22
00:02:23,038 --> 00:02:24,547
Descãlecaþi!

23
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:28,458
Adãpostiþi you behind the rocks!

24
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:44,824
Try not to waste you gloanþele.
On how much ...

25
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:46,822
It was my glonþul and do what I want with it!

26
00:02:46,823 --> 00:02:50,740
Give me that cigar once, Mamie!

27
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:56,241
Pacat ca bãieþii are plecaþi,
you could help.

28
00:02:56,242 --> 00:03:02,126
We can handle ourselves, and,
you know better, unaided.

29
00:03:03,193 --> 00:03:05,812
<i> Take care, Kenneth, that you're not
the carousel. </ i></i>

30
00:03:05,813 --> 00:03:10,185
<i> It's easy to humanize the girls are! </ i></i>

31
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:16,980
Courage, Johnny, it's yours.

32
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:19,776
Vai of those who neglect
purity of the soul!

33
00:03:19,777 --> 00:03:22,518
Not even Lord miles
can not save from hell!

34
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,143
Mila Lord helped already
avoiding to become a real priest.

35
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:28,709
It was Lord miles, but my dad ...

36
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,619
that he wanted to get money
of pocket to send me to the seminar.

37
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,363
You can keep teaching
fair in town.

38
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:37,353
Forgive them, because do not know what I mean.

39
00:03:37,354 --> 00:03:40,571
I come!

40
00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:43,447
I can you show me
how to tame it a horse.

41
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:46,568
<i> Lãudãrosule! </ i></i>

42
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:52,025
I do buy a whiskey
residency if you are more than a minute!

43
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:03,596
If we want to get þarc,
it is better to get behind the house.

44
00:04:03,597 --> 00:04:07,745
Pedro! Detour on the way!

45
00:04:18,022 --> 00:04:19,066
Jane!

46
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:24,033
Give me a hand
to move it.

47
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:33,958
Sorry.

48
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:43,826
Nice shot! On time
Geronimo's not a shot you and a.

49
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:48,832
Let 'me and you will see that crowd
that mucous and no one to come in the house.

50
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,250
At least not live.

51
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,247
Râdeþi, râdeþi.

52
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:57,364
Maybe I'll enter the house,
but will þarc sure.

53
00:04:57,365 --> 00:05:00,850
I e, þarcul!

54
00:05:04,188 --> 00:05:07,478
We hotãrâþi time to do something?

55
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:10,542
- Queen Ana!
- Sure!

56
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,718
Queen Ana, right!

57
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:15,610
Blessed are you, boys.
If I be us ...

58
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:17,359
You must have great patience.

59
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,438
- Gale! Uiþi what is most important.
- He is right.

60
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,015
- Come on come on!
- Hold.

61
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:26,346
Grãbiþi you!

62
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:32,290
Indian vase and Dorothy ii!

63
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:36,332
And how much it cost!

64
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,452
Only to be once it was.

65
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:50,926
Ana Regina not you never grow old.
Hold.

66
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:59,799
<i> It is better to straddle.
I can take them by surprise. </ I></i>

67
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,722
You can get immediate
þarc of animals. Let's go!

68
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:26,235
Strike this is my MacGREGOR.
Last time you have pulled it þii mind?

69
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:36,774
E Queen Ana!

70
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:41,034
Whiskey and glory!
Hooray for MacGREGOR!

71
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:47,851
The goddamn gun
I'll never get on track.

72
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:50,952
There's only one thing
to do: to attack the group.

73
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:54,038
- We next house and killed them all.
- Do we get home next?

74
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:58,057
But fuck like mad!
Half of us to die.

75
00:06:58,058 --> 00:07:02,892
Yes, but if you go back to horses
tonight, we'll kill Santillana.

76
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:07,269
Means to attack the house choose
the lower river, too?

77
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:12,011
Distanþaþi you and to my
I exit out everyone!

78
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,121
If you matu Dorothy would find
that it was broken vase ...

79
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:25,997
... we would never forget.
- Leave now damn vase.

80
00:07:25,998 --> 00:07:29,933
Friday and gentlemen orii that.

81
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:43,433
Hey, MacGREGOR!
We have some guests!

82
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:55,559
Courage, boys, otherwise you kidnap
wives!

83
00:08:12,294 --> 00:08:15,960
Dispose of weapons and predaþi you,
otherwise we fire house!

84
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:20,114
I'm sorry, my dear,
but I think he said to us.

85
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:22,147
Courage, hotãrâþi you!

86
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:25,705
We are old, sir,
rãcim and easy.

87
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:29,711
I think a little heat
we'll use for the bones.

88
00:08:29,712 --> 00:08:32,144
Go!

89
00:08:58,646 --> 00:09:04,299
Bãieþii! Friday bãieþii!
Alastair, your concerns!

90
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:16,612
- On windows, quick! Damn it!
- Now it Friday and reinforcements.

91
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:47,684
- Johnny! You are hurt?
- Go, I have nothing.

92
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:54,357
Rest in peace.

93
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:04,555
What is ludicrous? We have done
very well and without you.

94
00:10:04,556 --> 00:10:08,943
Better stingeþi fire.
Otherwise skip dinner tonight.

95
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:12,517
Come on, do your work!

96
00:10:17,244 --> 00:10:19,002
Hi, Mom.

97
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:22,522
Hi, Gregor.

98
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,014
Did you eat?
Put your handkerchief that cold.

99
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:29,411
I'm sorry, Johnny ...

100
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:33,625
but I think it is better to stay
home and to help the elderly.

101
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:38,586
- You know that the road is long and tedious.
- No need angel.

102
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:41,067
Yes, I need you, you know.

103
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:44,352
But to stay anyway, if
those guys that will appear again.

104
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,957
Those guys certainly
not-and will make appearance.

105
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,757
And anyway, once vânduþi horses,
will not have anything that you take.

106
00:10:51,758 --> 00:10:54,401
And even evening
spuneþi your prayer.

107
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:56,761
- Goodbye, Kenneth.
- Do you care.

108
00:10:56,762 --> 00:10:59,307
- Bye, honey.
Goodbye, mother.

109
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:01,718
- Bye, Indian and ica.
- When you think you'll întoarceþi?

110
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:04,838
In four days you should get
Las Mesas with the horses.

111
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:07,532
A day to sell them,
two to get back.

112
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,374
Yes, one week.

113
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,421
Do not understand why you must go
to Las Mesas ...

114
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:13,219
when San Diego's closer.

115
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,730
San Diego is closer to us
but also of Santillana.

116
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:18,892
- And it is better not to risk.
- But we always went to San Diego.

117
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:23,330
- Once in the life and Alistair are right.
- And once in the life you have confidence in us.

118
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:26,981
At Las Mesas is more secure.
And it pays better.

119
00:11:26,982 --> 00:11:29,459
- And now it is and rail ...
- Nonsense!

120
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,622
At least five dollars in addition
for each horse.

121
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:34,342
For me, this argument
put an end to any discussion.

122
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:38,806
Even the half of U.S. dollars
should end any discussion.

123
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:47,156
Subtitling = =
Florin-Bratianu-Constanta

124
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:34,525
- Look and Las Mesas.
- Nice place.

125
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:37,701
It remains to be seen.

126
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,171
Now that we put the horses in þarc ...

127
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,490
... hopefully to us and buy some.

128
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:58,495
- And that we pay well.
- And money ice.

129
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:01,902
Anything else?

130
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:05,229
You would like to find a girl?

131
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,871
I feel that this is not too
how to have fun.

132
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:13,205
It's a strange atmosphere. One of us
would have to remain with the þarc horses.

133
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:16,734
Let's take a look.

134
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:32,745
Rail we brought
hoþi than here.

135
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:35,608
<i> one I go to Dallas. </ i></i>

136
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:38,307
<i> This is not fair, it's a racket! </ i></i>

137
00:13:38,308 --> 00:13:40,288
<i> What kind of proposal I do </ i></i>

138
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:44,629
- Horses that I grew, I never steal!
- But who told you something?

139
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,566
<i>But  is a price and inos ru! </ i></i>

140
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:50,856
- Hello. Here's your whiskey.
- Thanks.

141
00:13:53,521 --> 00:13:57,338
I'm in here or it's supposed to be
a deal for animals?

142
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:01,358
No, not in the eli.
It is a deal of animal.

143
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:06,363
- This is the last price.
- No, Crawford! No! No and no!

144
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:09,612
Than to accept your conditions, better
eat them all on! One!

145
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:13,932
- Stevson is right!
- Stevson in the ealã!

146
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,759
Who shot?

147
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:27,720
I, and erifule. Stevson out gun
and had to defend myself.

148
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:31,023
Take away from this.

149
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:37,505
Hey, a minute!

150
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:40,297
But the man had a gun,
how was it out?

151
00:14:40,298 --> 00:14:44,562
- Keep your mouth, Dick! Do not meddle.
- It's the first time when veniþi here?

152
00:14:44,563 --> 00:14:47,593
Yeah, so's I got recently.

153
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:49,573
To deal.

154
00:14:49,574 --> 00:14:51,559
Be welcome.

155
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,744
I saw horses.
Beautiful animals.

156
00:14:55,745 --> 00:14:58,327
Crawford is interested in them.
Don 't you, Crawford?

157
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:02,378
Sure I'm interested.
And bãieþii ã and are very nice people.

158
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:05,971
- You hear how many heads you have?
- 200.

159
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:09,815
- Give them 1,000 dollars.
- I said 200 horses.

160
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:11,595
And I said, 1000 dollars.

161
00:15:11,596 --> 00:15:15,840
200 horses with one $ 5,
make 1000 dollars, right?

162
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:18,707
Yes.

163
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:22,440
Well.

164
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:23,861
Agreed.

165
00:15:23,862 --> 00:15:27,664
1000 dollars for nutreþ.

166
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,868
But for animals as I have?

167
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:38,057
Dude, in Las Mesas, I am
who buy.

168
00:15:38,058 --> 00:15:39,908
And nobody else.

169
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:45,594
The fixed price that I am,
and that it supports are too.

170
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,769
Got it?

171
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,836
Take your money and go with God.

172
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:58,571
Mind if we issue?

173
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:08,964
- Hooray for MacGREGOR!
- Hooray!

174
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,683
Omorâþi sure between you wild!

175
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:30,057
In the end I sing
real music.

176
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:45,161
Be careful, Gregor!

177
00:18:00,175 --> 00:18:03,175
Just felt the need.

178
00:18:04,414 --> 00:18:07,514
Mine is!

179
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:27,367
Sorry that I gave the bounce, but ...

180
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:45,195
You are beautiful.

181
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:49,166
I hope to have the chance to see you again.
My name is David MacGREGOR.

182
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,920
And I'm Barbara Othorn.

183
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:55,191
Goodbye.

184
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,268
It was a real pleasure.

185
00:19:25,753 --> 00:19:29,817
Stop it! Hands up!

186
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:33,328
Hands up, I said!

187
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:36,919
How many move you!

188
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,966
Haideþi!

189
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:51,212
Take their guns.

190
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:53,264
Melee, aggression ...

191
00:19:53,265 --> 00:19:55,061
dislocation lines and the public know ...

192
00:19:55,062 --> 00:19:58,090
... and yet incalculable damages.

193
00:19:58,091 --> 00:20:03,609
- Inches, and here you have time to make sure lines.
- Yes, but I was provocaþi.

194
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,640
Us must get that mulþumiþi
he used no guns, and erifule.

195
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:09,377
- This is a city still.
- Still a cemetery.

196
00:20:09,378 --> 00:20:12,746
It's a luxury room.

197
00:20:13,841 --> 00:20:16,920
Faster!

198
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:24,315
- And that should be the eriful?
- We closed for few punches.

199
00:20:24,316 --> 00:20:26,637
Do not you seem exaggerated?

200
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:30,351
A erif and so intensely
are not found throughout the west.

201
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:33,555
And yet I was worth.

202
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:36,411
During the melee of hand
certain meetings ...

203
00:20:36,412 --> 00:20:38,500
A woman?

204
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,940
An angel.

205
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:45,337
- Let's you better look out.
- Sit still, and erifule, sit still.

206
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:48,415
Let's go.

207
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:51,617
Dislocation lines and the public know ...
I feel like laughing.

208
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:56,049
- I say so ...
- No, not about the lines and public tea ...

209
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,277
... and no melee.

210
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:02,219
They just wanted us to get
of road.

211
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,579
- And why?
- Like to take our horses.

212
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,819
Clearer than that ...

213
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,876
Maybe gre º esc.

214
00:21:14,877 --> 00:21:18,096
But here I feel the smell of Santillana.

215
00:21:18,097 --> 00:21:23,855
If the way you say, why not back
the road, and as soon as possible?

216
00:21:24,236 --> 00:21:26,656
Maybe you were right the elderly.

217
00:21:26,657 --> 00:21:28,877
It was better to go
to sell horses in San Diego.

218
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:30,965
And now what?

219
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:35,197
Must do in any way. Unless,
your imagination what the vote says the elderly.

220
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:36,798
Peter.

221
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,987
See if the door's resistance.

222
00:21:39,988 --> 00:21:42,789
Well.

223
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:57,446
Here is nothing to do.

224
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:04,665
Keep an eye on our buddy.

225
00:22:12,602 --> 00:22:15,890
Daþi me a spur.

226
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:21,877
- Who has a piece of string?
- I think that is me.

227
00:22:21,878 --> 00:22:25,211
That's good?

228
00:22:25,531 --> 00:22:28,448
Keep you here, you here.

229
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:31,252
Pull.

230
00:22:32,193 --> 00:22:37,142
Work!
But it can be and better.

231
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,442
Warning!

232
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:49,944
My involvement and that he did a hungry ...

233
00:23:51,975 --> 00:23:56,403
I a. Enough so.
Haideþi!

234
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,824
Good night.

235
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:24,512
I thank you, Virgin of the Pillar!
I thank you!

236
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,087
Haideþi, boys!
At þarcuri!

237
00:24:55,838 --> 00:24:58,482
Þarcurile Here!

238
00:24:58,483 --> 00:25:01,594
- But are empty!
- Blestemãþie!

239
00:25:01,595 --> 00:25:03,298
- Have disappeared.
- Tâlharii!

240
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,622
- I told myself.
- Will pay for it!

241
00:25:05,623 --> 00:25:08,464
And when you Think that you venisem here
close to good business.

242
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,241
Now who is back home
without animals and without money?

243
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:13,335
- Old'll kill us!
- I say so ...

244
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:18,027
Traces are still fresh.
I should be away.

245
00:25:18,028 --> 00:25:20,636
Let's go!

246
00:25:37,348 --> 00:25:42,550
- Water and ii!
- No, not here.

247
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:48,968
Be carefully, boys.
Could be a trap.

248
00:25:50,056 --> 00:25:55,502
I never saw anything so when the Indians
chyrykawa buried the hatchet.

249
00:25:55,503 --> 00:25:58,284
Descãlecaþi!

250
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:08,177
Damn it!

251
00:26:54,306 --> 00:26:57,296
Forgive me.
I thought that you're a water and.

252
00:26:57,297 --> 00:27:00,697
Blestematule!

253
00:27:20,321 --> 00:27:25,134
Hey, boys.
Veniþi to see.

254
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:57,526
My father tried to arrange them in a colony are
to be opposed to Crawford.

255
00:27:57,527 --> 00:27:59,979
I think Crawford has done that?

256
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,217
I do not know, it's hard to say.
Those who attacked us ...

257
00:28:04,218 --> 00:28:06,951
... were not men.
Are secure.

258
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:13,451
It was a powerful banda, were many.
Certainly came from the border.

259
00:28:15,924 --> 00:28:21,520
- As those who have attacked our farm.
- It could be same i. Now is clear.

260
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:27,048
- Santillana?
- Yes, Santillana ...

261
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:30,913
- He came up here.
- What are the Santillana Crawford?

262
00:28:30,914 --> 00:28:34,401
It should be about, Rosita.

263
00:28:34,402 --> 00:28:37,700
Do you have any plan, Gregor?

264
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:41,565
Just to say that I have an idea.

265
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:47,053
To stay here yet.
It's a place where no one can find us one.

266
00:28:47,054 --> 00:28:48,457
Dick ...

267
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:51,701
Come back to you old.
Line up the them and explains the situation.

268
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:53,856
- I just have to go?
- You are the lowest.

269
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:57,725
And you won 't get too certain.

270
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:03,945
You others, aranjaþi little house,
you can even sleep in it.

271
00:29:03,946 --> 00:29:07,505
And what you gonna do?

272
00:29:07,803 --> 00:29:11,991
I'll give up a getaway to Las Mesas.

273
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:14,768
I am curious to see how it has failed
escape us.

274
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:19,752
I think I'll be back
with much clearer ideas.

275
00:29:32,513 --> 00:29:35,592
<i> But Santillana, you can not
Think you are up to you something. </ i></i>

276
00:29:35,593 --> 00:29:38,144
<i> I was always loyal to you. </ i></i>

277
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:42,177
I hope this for you, Crawford. Moreover,
if you reconcile with science, as saying ...

278
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:44,600
n you want me to refuse hospitality.

279
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:46,667
And if you do not want to come with you?

280
00:29:46,668 --> 00:29:50,886
Few had ienþa to the INCON
contradict me, and have paid dearly.

281
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:54,017
You can inform you of the old
Carson and his daughter, Rosita.

282
00:29:54,018 --> 00:29:58,019
You are sure of the power, right?

283
00:30:04,328 --> 00:30:08,529
I have not any reason to be? Time
that I brought only a small escort.

284
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,397
I knew that I am among friends.

285
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:14,718
Straddle horse, Crawford!
One can have a pleasant conversation together.

286
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:18,507
Come on, Crawford.

287
00:30:25,096 --> 00:30:30,189
Goodbye, and erifule!
I can send you my instructions.

288
00:30:34,403 --> 00:30:38,436
Haideþi, boys!

289
00:31:00,975 --> 00:31:06,941
Step that must be repaired,
otherwise one that hurt someone.

290
00:31:07,414 --> 00:31:09,427
This is the Rio Pecos.

291
00:31:09,428 --> 00:31:12,227
This is his lair Santillana.

292
00:31:12,228 --> 00:31:15,682
Here, five hours away on horseback,
us.

293
00:31:15,683 --> 00:31:21,108
And here in Las Mesas, Crawford steals
animals, the way it has done and with us.

294
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:24,495
When they go beyond the river ...

295
00:31:24,496 --> 00:31:28,208
and the pred of Santillana,
they sell. Is that clear?

296
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:30,773
Crawford and it's spit.

297
00:31:30,774 --> 00:31:33,312
Crawford must bear
any condition ...

298
00:31:33,313 --> 00:31:36,166
even if a deal with the stran dinþii i.

299
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,719
Because when one gives
increased animal which opposes ...

300
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,911
Santillana ... intervenes with force,
while the eriful ...

301
00:31:42,912 --> 00:31:45,152
... shall ensure that nobody
not be punished.

302
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,774
- I say that you ...
- A perfect organization.

303
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:50,942
And we what?
Sit and look lini sure?

304
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,587
Yes, but not outside.

305
00:31:53,588 --> 00:31:57,433
I have to go into banda.

306
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,039
See, dude, you tried
I go to the nose.

307
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,863
And I don 't like to be taken to move to.
You had my trust and you betrayed it.

308
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:06,614
And now, Crawford, you'll pay dearly
for this.

309
00:33:06,615 --> 00:33:10,650
So, who wants to follow your example,
will think six times before to do.

310
00:33:10,651 --> 00:33:14,777
I didn 't go nose, Santillana.

311
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:19,590
I just gave all animals
the fair in Las Mesas!

312
00:33:19,591 --> 00:33:23,592
All 200 less horses that
did you removed the night of þarc ...

313
00:33:23,593 --> 00:33:27,199
while the eriful to keep it cooler
on their owners.

314
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,787
I do not know anything about horses that!
This is the truth!

315
00:33:30,788 --> 00:33:34,468
Minþi Crawford! You wanted to go atragi
and me in this affair.

316
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:39,342
But I do not betray my friends
especially for a partner like you.

317
00:33:39,343 --> 00:33:43,953
Enough talking!
Let's start the show.

318
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:05,622
Today!

319
00:34:05,623 --> 00:34:09,426
- To be clean!
- Yes, excellence.

320
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:30,441
Rollick and them. In a place like this
not how to have fun.

321
00:34:30,442 --> 00:34:33,951
And when ive the chance ...

322
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:51,485
My time was different. That
yield more than five minutes.

323
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:57,193
I'm glad.

324
00:34:57,194 --> 00:35:00,126
I'm glad to have a partner like you.

325
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:03,759
If we associate, we can do
more traffic than the animals.

326
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,945
And then put the animals.

327
00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:11,463
There are other ways to us îmbogãþim
quickly and with less effort.

328
00:35:11,464 --> 00:35:14,573
Fat is not wake up.

329
00:35:14,574 --> 00:35:16,675
Definitely not worth a damn.

330
00:35:16,676 --> 00:35:22,117
Very bad! Very bad!
Men for anything!

331
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:27,958
It would be better to go.

332
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,677
I want to get to Las Mesas dawn.

333
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:34,072
I transmitted to you as the tile.

334
00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:36,892
Goodbye, friend.
Bon voyage.

335
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:39,978
And to give signs of life
as soon as possible.

336
00:35:39,979 --> 00:35:45,592
This is something that Crawford
he can do.

337
00:36:04,693 --> 00:36:09,491
- Polished up my shoes! Faster!
- Yes, excellence.

338
00:36:16,772 --> 00:36:19,780
Whiskey.

339
00:36:31,301 --> 00:36:33,908
Huh? What's the big idea?

340
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:36,566
When so many guns around ...

341
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:40,733
it is better to get rid of greutãþi.

342
00:36:42,455 --> 00:36:48,422
Someone i could come a little draw.
It's a prudent and a.

343
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:54,848
You're right, buddy.
It's healthy, right?

344
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:58,512
I like people prudenþi.
But I'd like to know ...

345
00:36:58,513 --> 00:37:03,032
what a guy here
so cautious that you?

346
00:37:03,033 --> 00:37:07,535
I know that people searching Santillana,
and I'm here to enlist.

347
00:37:07,536 --> 00:37:12,243
That's only if you offer
is convenient.

348
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:16,325
If not, this is fun anyway.
It's already something.

349
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:22,238
And as a thought to offer Santillana ...
a cautious guy like you?

350
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,874
Much.

351
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:32,294
Because you see, I have left
gun because I am scared of you ...

352
00:37:32,295 --> 00:37:36,690
but because they are a little nervous
and he's like someone here ...

353
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:40,596
... and to lose life.
- Listen, pal.

354
00:37:40,597 --> 00:37:45,348
I like your jokes.
And I do not like strangers.

355
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:49,998
So I delete it as soon ...
if you do not want to give you a lecþie!

356
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:54,109
- But I really want to get a lecþie.
- What?

357
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:57,074
I think that always
something you learned in your life.

358
00:37:57,075 --> 00:38:01,977
And if someone wants to give me
a lecþie not refuse.

359
00:38:14,687 --> 00:38:17,487
Get out of here!

360
00:38:52,467 --> 00:38:53,789
Stop it!

361
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,639
Do not shoot against a man
unarmed.

362
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,486
You should you know it, Miguel.

363
00:39:06,464 --> 00:39:09,464
- What are you, gringo?
- You are Santillana?

364
00:39:09,465 --> 00:39:11,604
I heard that you're in search
pricepuþi people.

365
00:39:11,605 --> 00:39:16,905
With fists good, gringo,
but the gun where you left?

366
00:39:16,906 --> 00:39:18,751
Put down that gun.

367
00:39:18,752 --> 00:39:21,779
When you enter the house of friends,
leave it to the wardrobe.

368
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,782
Otherwise I would too dangerous.

369
00:39:39,718 --> 00:39:43,114
- I like you, gringo. How you name?
- Thompson.

370
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:47,330
Kid Thompson. If you kill me,
receive 150 dollars.

371
00:39:47,331 --> 00:39:49,145
But live you'll get more profit.

372
00:39:49,146 --> 00:39:53,706
But Thompson is not in prison
from Yuma?

373
00:39:53,707 --> 00:39:57,691
She ... in Yuma.

374
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:33,321
- Santillana here?
- Yes, it's up.

- But why? What I did?
- I'm wondering?

396
00:42:28,883 --> 00:42:31,444
Destrãbãlato!

397
00:42:31,445 --> 00:42:33,365
Where did you hide?

398
00:42:33,366 --> 00:42:34,329
- Rosita!
- Who?

399
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:36,650
<i> I know right!
If you give him, I do bucãþi! </ I></i>

400
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:39,131
Are you crazy?

401
00:42:39,132 --> 00:42:42,498
Damn!

402
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,920
Forgive me, but it was an impulse
stronger than me.

403
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:47,593
Nice way to greet me.

404
00:42:47,594 --> 00:42:50,845
Now understand why you wanted
so much to get in the banda.

405
00:42:50,846 --> 00:42:54,386
And I, as a poor,
I worry for you.

406
00:42:54,387 --> 00:42:58,098
Do not say shit.
You better tell me, why are you here?

407
00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:01,649
Why do not you and Dick?

408
00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:07,627
Listen, Gregor ...
I know you ride as good as you.

409
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:12,422
And here, dressed so, to give a
less than one suspect in man.

410
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,533
You are crazy! You must go back
immediately to the farm.

411
00:43:15,534 --> 00:43:18,427
I want to revenge my father,
trying to understand.

412
00:43:18,428 --> 00:43:20,536
Last night I did it succeed to sleep.

413
00:43:20,537 --> 00:43:23,457
Felt that it should be
next to you and run.

414
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:27,488
But if you do not want me ...

415
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,044
Not that you want.

416
00:43:31,045 --> 00:43:35,449
But you must send
an urgent message fraþilor mine.

417
00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:41,119
Be very careful. This
ita succeed depends on my plan.

418
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:52,190
- Good day, Mr. Director.
- Bonjour Smith.

419
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,578

- Bonjour, Barner.

420
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:57,329
- Good day, Mr. Director.

421
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:01,932
Bonjour, Mr. Director.
- Good day ...

422
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:04,068
But you who are you?

423
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:09,823
My name is Santillana, sir.
I think you have already heard of him.

424
00:44:10,494 --> 00:44:14,588
Money wages for miners are
in your safe, if not me-no he.

425
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:18,082
Mr. Santillana would
to withdraw staff.

426
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:21,836
Please, open it.

427
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:35,807
Daþi you off now.
We can handle ourselves.

428
00:44:35,808 --> 00:44:40,306
You do not want to take it?

429
00:44:52,286 --> 00:44:56,875
Courage. Ready soon.

430
00:45:03,636 --> 00:45:06,736
Barbara ...

431
00:45:13,282 --> 00:45:16,036
Come on!
No time to lose!

432
00:45:16,037 --> 00:45:17,792
Yes, wine.

433
00:45:17,793 --> 00:45:22,036
But she, who more reviews now?

434
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,417
And erifule! And erifule!

435
00:45:39,418 --> 00:45:42,160
What disaster! Hurry!

436
00:45:42,161 --> 00:45:46,849
Santillana's banda! Thanks
God's erifule! You are here!

437
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:50,407
- But you are not the eriful!
- Sure it's not eriful!

438
00:45:50,408 --> 00:45:53,693
And no I suggest you call him
if you want a glonþ headed!

439
00:45:53,694 --> 00:45:57,665
But you who are you?
What?

440
00:45:59,146 --> 00:46:03,160
My name Santillana.
I think you heard me.

441
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:05,737
I want the money that is
in your safe!

442
00:46:05,738 --> 00:46:08,434
But money is not safe.
No more, I want to say.

443
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:11,808
Were furaþi all! All!
Bandiþii what they left.

444
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:15,625
And then, you are not Santillana!

445
00:46:15,626 --> 00:46:20,163
My friend, I love jokes!

446
00:46:26,746 --> 00:46:28,395
Hey, you!

447
00:46:28,396 --> 00:46:30,575
Come here!

448
00:46:30,576 --> 00:46:34,571
- I ...
- Shut up!

449
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:40,293
Get in!

450
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:45,426
What means this?
Where is the money?

451
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:48,646
How where they? In pockets
Santillana's! I told him that they stole!

452
00:46:48,647 --> 00:46:51,100
There is no dollar here.
I go everywhere.

453
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:55,980
Not even one U.S. dollars!
Santillana took everything!

454
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:58,479
Nice surprise.

455
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,439
I do not knew that two of Santillana.

00:47:04,931 --> 00:47:07,769
<i> Vamos! </ i></i>

457
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:17,714
We started well.

458
00:47:17,715 --> 00:47:21,128
I always go to
your business?

459
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:26,096
Me I like the bread tigat
today.

460
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:30,524
I never saw any
atâþia money.

461
00:47:30,525 --> 00:47:36,251
- You should put them in a safe place.
- Let's put the bank.

462
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,552
But who are you?

463
00:48:17,553 --> 00:48:20,781
What want?

464
00:48:21,173 --> 00:48:25,359
Sir, iertaþi me,
But the question they put us.

00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,470
- You ... Who are you?
- I judge Garland.

466
00:48:28,471 --> 00:48:31,499

best friend of mine.

467

On his daughter, Rosita,
I saw a nãscându is.

A So you

I am judge of Las Mesas.
More names than facts.

00:48:46,597 --> 00:48:49,158
Because the law do now bandiþii ...

476

00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:13,475
Rosita!

481
00:49:13,476 --> 00:49:16,604
Rosita ...

482
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:18,628
You are more beautiful.

I fell into an ambush!

489
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:33,995
What is happening?
Who shoot us?

490
00:50:33,996 --> 00:50:36,252
Who want to be?

491
00:50:36,253 --> 00:50:39,959
Or have those who robbed the bank.

492
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,363
But this time we'll pay it.
Acoperiþi me!

493
00:50:50,337 --> 00:50:51,876
<i> Carramba! </ i></i>

Why!
Thompson is a real devil!

495
00:50:54,602 --> 00:50:58,643
- Look at him!
- Yes, but I'll never succeed eascã.

496
00:50:59,733 --> 00:51:05,303
Boys! To draw to protect us

00:51:40,837 --> 00:51:45,183
- And my mother?

You engaged?

504
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:51,641
Want to stop saying shit?

505
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:54,454
That girl is dead after you
I bet with your head.

506
00:51:54,455 --> 00:51:57,872
What if you did not?

507
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:06,000
Hey, Greg!

508
00:52:07,213 --> 00:52:08,684
What?

509
00:52:08,685 --> 00:52:13,382
It's a load of silver bullion
Santillana that brings them in Mexico.

510
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:15,992
Why!

511
00:52:15,993 --> 00:52:19,137
Here on the our.

512
00:52:21,536 --> 00:52:24,143
- Dispose of arms and hands up!
- Without the mecherii!

513
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:27,021
Damn, what happens?

514
00:52:27,022 --> 00:52:29,433
- Come on down!
- Later, Gregor!

515
00:52:29,434 --> 00:52:32,708
And greet her Rosita
from me!

516
00:52:42,831 --> 00:52:47,696
Let us hurry, boys!
To take charge in a safe place!

517
00:53:04,442 --> 00:53:07,643
Blestemaþii!

518
00:53:16,664 --> 00:53:20,764
What beautiful show!

519
00:53:26,931 --> 00:53:30,474
Are a bunch of spineless.
I put about 20 on the run alone.

520
00:53:30,475 --> 00:53:32,591
We came from one percent.

521
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:35,814
They come at once.
Like it out of Earth.

522
00:53:35,815 --> 00:53:39,097
We fought, but you were too
Next, you have to see how.

523
00:53:39,098 --> 00:53:42,313
Were more than one percent, I say!

524
00:53:42,314 --> 00:53:44,145
And probably have killed many
of them.

525
00:53:44,146 --> 00:53:45,912
Lots!

526
00:53:45,913 --> 00:53:47,255
And where are they?

527
00:53:47,256 --> 00:53:51,584
Well, they succeed in it to take on everyone,
both morþii and the rãniþii.

528
00:53:51,585 --> 00:53:55,802
He wants you to be in your skin
When I povestiþi this to Santillana.

529
00:53:55,803 --> 00:54:00,003
Santillana! Santillana always!
Let him try to do the job!

530
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:03,294
Fool!
It's the last chance that you have!

531
00:54:03,295 --> 00:54:05,941
May do me any inconvenience
and he said to you!

532
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:07,669
All happens only
when Thompson came!

533
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:10,874
Idiot!
All should be like him!

534
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:14,628
Come on, name them in!

535
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,672
Intraþi!

536
00:54:43,671 --> 00:54:46,485
Dullness good thing!

537
00:54:46,486 --> 00:54:52,062
Daþi When in trouble, I am the
protects you. Just me!

538
00:54:52,063 --> 00:54:56,279
And when the riot colony you know,
call to Santillana.

539
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,669
If you need to acoperiþi
escrocheriile, who chemaþi?

540
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,690
On Santillana!

541
00:55:01,691 --> 00:55:07,269
And I ask you to do my run
orders with a minimum of inteligenþã.

542
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:14,257
And I discover the traitors
which is among you. Too much?

543
00:55:14,258 --> 00:55:19,986
There's an area in banda
we break plans.

544
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:22,744
There are some bandiþi, right?

545
00:55:22,745 --> 00:55:27,336
Means that your business, and erifule!

546
00:55:28,134 --> 00:55:33,491
Anyway, I have in mind a blow
we will cover all losses.

547
00:55:39,357 --> 00:55:43,999
And this time do not allow gre and eli.

548
00:56:06,422 --> 00:56:09,265
- Is everything okay?
- All right, yet.

549
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:11,039
Hopefully that will be you next.

550
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,064
With all the gold you transport
you are more scared than those at hand.

551
00:56:15,065 --> 00:56:18,988
- Tell me about it?
- Hello!

552
00:58:15,837 --> 00:58:19,369
Hands up! Stop the train!

553
00:58:26,505 --> 00:58:30,205
I told you to hold back!

554
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,780
You three open wagon with gold!

555
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:42,020
Hurry! Daþi people down!

556
00:58:53,939 --> 00:58:56,907
<i> Ajutaþi us to get gold! </ i></i>

557
00:58:56,908 --> 00:59:00,139
Who shot?

558
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:07,902
Now it's two people no longer wake up.
David, let it start.

559
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,485
We are ready.

560
00:59:10,486 --> 00:59:13,558
<i> What </ i></i>

561
00:59:15,493 --> 00:59:18,373
Barbara! Barbara!

562
00:59:18,374 --> 00:59:21,759
Gentlemen and Othorn time!
I'm that guy from the salon!

563
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,278
I recognize you?

564
00:59:24,279 --> 00:59:27,990
Miss Barbara's time!

565
00:59:27,991 --> 00:59:32,091
Stop it! Stop it!

566
00:59:32,617 --> 00:59:37,736
- Jim, what happened?
- No idea.

567
00:59:38,789 --> 00:59:43,157
I'm going to see what happened.

568
01:00:08,149 --> 01:00:11,933
Warning, arrives!

569
01:00:21,339 --> 01:00:25,039
Who shot at you our?

570
01:00:31,106 --> 01:00:34,449
Better target our fraþii.

571
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:37,839
Get in, Peter!

572
01:00:59,693 --> 01:01:02,912
Congratulations, boys.
You did good job.

573
01:01:02,913 --> 01:01:05,679
And you.

574
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,902
Ãstuia I'll use
little fresh air.

575
01:01:08,903 --> 01:01:11,307
And now what will you tell
Santillana's?

576
01:01:11,308 --> 01:01:14,370
Me? Well, as I received
a blow to the head.

577
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:20,633
Take the train to Vallee, you will get
gold can not bother anyone.

578
01:01:21,412 --> 01:01:23,171
And what are you doing?

579
01:01:23,172 --> 01:01:28,430
And in them, right? A so when others arrive,
'll find me here next to him sprawling.

580
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:31,811
Remember how to proceed.

581
01:01:49,318 --> 01:01:51,689
Go! Good day!

582
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:53,116
Goodbye, Gregor!

583
01:01:53,117 --> 01:01:59,099
Good day!
Pleasant rest!

584
01:02:23,638 --> 01:02:25,943
First silver ...

585
01:02:25,944 --> 01:02:31,992
... then gold mining company,
plus money from the bank in San Diego.

586
01:02:31,993 --> 01:02:35,392
Dearly beloved, in my warehouse
that almost no room.

587
01:02:35,393 --> 01:02:39,392
If we continue so we have a
Reserve more than Federal bank.

588
01:02:39,393 --> 01:02:43,967
While his Santillana
will be completely empty.

589
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:48,049
But our pockets and
are empty, Judge.

590
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:50,352
You can get daþi $ 10
for a good lunch.

591
01:02:50,353 --> 01:02:53,843
Oh no! We are not bandiþi.

592
01:02:53,844 --> 01:02:57,568
I did one I'd like to be in place
poor ...

593
01:02:57,569 --> 01:03:02,978
which will lead to Santillana
this news.

594
01:03:11,089 --> 01:03:16,137
Better words are, otherwise you'll put
wounds on a layer of melted sugar.

595
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,597
Zaharul burn wounds ...

596
01:03:31,598 --> 01:03:35,918
... and like it very much
ants and ro ii.

597
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:41,559
I will eat alive.

598
01:03:42,857 --> 01:03:45,336
You are încãpãþânat, you?

599
01:03:45,337 --> 01:03:47,795
Sugar!

600
01:03:47,796 --> 01:03:51,410
No! Ready, go!

601
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:55,158
I speak! I say to you all!
But it does not torture!

602
01:03:55,159 --> 01:03:58,274
But you who are you?

603
01:04:02,021 --> 01:04:05,924
Daughter of an honest man
You have killed you!

604
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:11,024
I say whatever you want
if it cruþi life.

605
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:36,652
- No, Rosita!
- You come with me.

606
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:39,081
Get it here!

607
01:04:39,082 --> 01:04:43,357
Ants can not wait May
today.

608
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:53,226
Thanks for the information.
I hope for you to be true.

609
01:04:53,227 --> 01:04:55,849
Meat 's too beautiful
to the SFA and iem whip.

610
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:59,521
You have only mângâieri.
My and my people.

611
01:04:59,522 --> 01:05:05,119
Pãziþi is good! Tomorrow resume
fun with the whole family.

612
01:05:09,952 --> 01:05:13,074
Rosita, what have you done?

613
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:17,165
What did you say? What did you say?

614
01:05:17,809 --> 01:05:20,094
- Gregor ...
- Say it!

615
01:05:20,095 --> 01:05:25,361
I told him everything. How to take
by surprise ... to my farm.

616
01:05:25,558 --> 01:05:27,677
What could you do?

617
01:05:27,678 --> 01:05:30,987
But all will fall with
Santillana in his hands!

618
01:05:30,988 --> 01:05:33,994
Without even to defend,
without-and aware of, understand?

619
01:05:33,995 --> 01:05:38,635
Understand what you did, nefericito?

620
01:05:40,447 --> 01:05:43,066
I just know that ...

621
01:05:43,067 --> 01:05:46,806
.... that you're still in your life.

622
01:05:48,584 --> 01:05:54,952
24 hours of life or more
less does not change things much.

623
01:05:55,360 --> 01:06:00,716
Tomorrow I'll die anyway
while you ...

624
01:06:01,731 --> 01:06:08,480
Gregor, sometimes several hours worth
rather than whole life.

625
01:06:08,985 --> 01:06:11,105
No ...

626
01:06:11,106 --> 01:06:14,354
It's not right ...

627
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:07,833
An exit to im here.
I had an idea.

628
01:08:43,316 --> 01:08:45,217
Look at him.

629
01:08:45,218 --> 01:08:48,539
I have got all.

630
01:09:08,487 --> 01:09:11,774
What do you do?

631
01:09:11,775 --> 01:09:14,751
I do not know. I know only that and my
should be there.

632
01:09:14,752 --> 01:09:18,104
Friday and me with you.

633
01:09:18,348 --> 01:09:23,954
You know what you wait if you catch?
But you can find free help.

634
01:09:23,955 --> 01:09:26,783
Why invent this
just to eject me.

635
01:09:26,784 --> 01:09:30,074
No, it's a matter of life
and death.

636
01:09:30,075 --> 01:09:33,220
You must go. If you stay with me
would be a vain sacrifice.

637
01:09:33,221 --> 01:09:36,903
If you need to die,
I want to die and I with you.

638
01:09:36,904 --> 01:09:39,141
Hard încãpãþânatã's you!

639
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:44,554
You know what? Here, the scoþieni,
women never discuss!

640
01:10:04,689 --> 01:10:08,548
Good luck, Rosita.

641
01:10:54,054 --> 01:10:58,156
No! No, Santillana! No!
I do not have any guilt!

642
01:10:58,157 --> 01:11:00,363
You let you escape a prisoner.

643
01:11:00,364 --> 01:11:03,250
And this is coming at me
it pays to life.

644
01:11:03,251 --> 01:11:06,743
To be a lecþie for all.

645
01:11:07,606 --> 01:11:09,681
It's useless to search on the motherfucker.

646
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:13,438
And anyway, single
no one can do anything.

647
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:18,928
Ramon! Take up the rest of the family.
Prepare them a warm reception.

648
01:11:42,092 --> 01:11:45,446
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

649
01:11:45,447 --> 01:11:48,824
I'd like to confess me.
It is very urgent.

650
01:11:48,825 --> 01:11:51,370
A wait, son. I'm going to call him
the parent Fulcenzio.

651
01:11:51,371 --> 01:11:54,371
Thanks much.

652
01:12:12,196 --> 01:12:15,975
<i> annual Virgin Festival
of Guadalupe. Fireworks. </ I></i>

653
01:13:27,525 --> 01:13:32,098
<i> Faster!
Santillana wait! </ I></i>

654
01:13:51,626 --> 01:13:57,232
- We are almost done.
- Go and prepares the prisoners.

655
01:14:47,001 --> 01:14:51,123
It's time to light the fire!

656
01:15:03,986 --> 01:15:07,676
<i> Haideþi! Prepare yourself! </ I></i>

657
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:23,151
Can I give the signal?

658
01:16:08,845 --> 01:16:11,861
I'm here, boys!

659
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:20,352
Fugiþi!

660
01:16:31,478 --> 01:16:35,298
David! Take that you little!

661
01:16:38,964 --> 01:16:41,111
Let us cherish in!

662
01:16:41,112 --> 01:16:42,592
What do we do?

663
01:16:42,593 --> 01:16:48,002
Înconjuraþi house. We attack at dawn.

664
01:16:54,167 --> 01:16:57,488
<i> high heavens! </ i></i>

665
01:16:59,951 --> 01:17:03,370
Lucky that the judge had
treasure with him when we got caught.

666
01:17:03,371 --> 01:17:05,133
What would have been disaster.

667
01:17:05,134 --> 01:17:09,353
All efforts and dangers that
I passed, would have been unnecessary.

668
01:17:09,354 --> 01:17:13,460
Mark, how many gloanþe you have left?

669
01:17:13,461 --> 01:17:16,299
We have a total
only about 70 gloanþe.

670
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,771
Economy must do.
Economy!

671
01:17:18,772 --> 01:17:22,087
For 15 generations we all economy.

672
01:17:22,088 --> 01:17:26,582
I recommend to make a scoþian
economy is almost an insult.

673
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:28,995
Not sure supãraþi. I wanted to say ...

674
01:17:28,996 --> 01:17:33,377
Each impui and should cãturã

sang of bagpipe
and led the final assault.

690
01:20:40,721 --> 01:20:43,016
Shame you do not have a bagpipe.

691
01:20:43,017 --> 01:20:47,333
In lack of something better,
and it goes.

692
01:20:47,334 --> 01:20:50,195
Peter is right.

717
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:12,244

01:28:36,551 --> 01:28:40,462
I forgot to tell you that each of
Thank you pãgubiþii that ...

720
01:28:42,785 --> 01:28:48,766
decided to leave as a Reward
to you in sign of recognition tinþã.

721
01:28:48,767 --> 01:28:51,656
And everything together,
makes a nice amount.

722
01:28:51,657 --> 01:28:53,992
And so we got back, and horses,
and money.

723
01:28:53,993 --> 01:28:57,355
Father, bring your mind that I
have to base my family.

724
01:28:57,356 --> 01:28:59,624
Well, that'll make you a loan.
