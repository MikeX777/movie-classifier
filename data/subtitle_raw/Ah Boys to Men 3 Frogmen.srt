Sir, they need you.
I can take care of myself.

00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,759
-You sure?
-Yes, sir.

36
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,839
Okay, you take cover here.

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,079

00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:54,879
Check it out. This way.

41
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:14,999
Protect this place.

42
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:17,759
Get down.

00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,239

00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,159
Drop your weapon.

46
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,639
-Put down your weapon.
-Help me.

47
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,559
Drop your weapon.

48
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:11,919
Put down your weapon.

00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:12,999

00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:15,199
Drop your weapon.

52
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,239
Put down your weapon.

53
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,239
Ken.

54
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,639
There are no female crew on the list.

55
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:27,839
Do your homework.

56
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,159
Yes, sir.

57
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,559
Gunner standby for engagement.

58
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:39,639
Copied, sir.

59
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,079
Break right, Break right.

60
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:50,599
Gunner engage target.

61
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,879
Execute.

62
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,239
Get out.

63
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,559
Get out.

64
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:07,719
Get out now.

65
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:17,839
Calm down. Relax.

66
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,119
Anything we can discuss.

67
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,199
Put your guns down! Move.

68
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,119
Just calm down, we are backing off.

69
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,079
It's okay guys, come down.

70
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:30,759
Down.

71
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:32,319
Move.

72
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,559
We are going down.

73
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,759
Move.

74
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,399
2, 6. Hooyah.

75
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,479
Faster.

76
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,239
Everybody get down.

77
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:51,079
Who is your commanding officer?

78
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,279
You.

79
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,039
Tell your men to put their weapons
on the deck.

80
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,159
Do it now.

81
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,199
Relax.

82
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,559
Hold your fire.

83
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,239
He has a pressure release detonator.

84
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:14,079
Relax. What is it that you want?

85
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,199
Let me know.

86
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,919
I'm tired of negotiating.

87
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:18,479
I want money.

88
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,719
I want my chopper

89
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,479
so I can go home.

90
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,519
And I want it right now.

91
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,479
Whatever you want, I still need some time.

92
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,199
Back! Get back.

93
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,719
Get back.

94
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,399
Back.

95
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,439
That's right.

96
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,479
Back. Get back. Do it now.

97
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:55,999
Aloysius.

98
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,799
Man overboard.

99
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,399
Aloysius.

100
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,399
Aloysius.

101
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,679
Go check it out.

102
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,959
Hello! Do you still remember me?

103
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,759
Yes, I am Aloysius Jin Seah-lan,
Zeng Xie-lang.

104
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,879
What you saw just now is not a game.

105
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:40,279
Why are we in this counter
terrorism mission?

106
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:46,999
Yes, I know you remembered

107
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,079
all of us did our BMT in Tekong.
(BMT: basic military training.)

108
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,599
But do you know that

109
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,919
not all soldiers in the SAF
did their BMT there?

110
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:55,959
So, what if

111
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:58,639
all of us got posted to the elite force

112
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,359
Naval Diving Unit as mono-intakers?

113
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,999
What's going to happen?

114
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,719
This is our another story.

115
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,879
Let's start with Lobang King.

116
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:13,399
Ah Beng.

117
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:15,239
Pretty lady, I'm not Ah Beng.

118
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,319
Then you're Ah Seng.

119
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:17,879
I bought this handphone from you yesterday

120
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:19,879
because you told me
it's the cheapest around.

121
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,319
When I asked around

122
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:24,879
yours is more expensive by 50.

123
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,839
And you short-change me a battery.

124
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,639
How could you cheat me?

125
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,759
Hey Pretty.

126
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,399
I would cheat on anyone,
but never a pretty girl.

127
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,559
I am sure that those you checked

128
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,599
do not have an international warranty.

129
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,199
What if your phone spoils
while you're overseas?

130
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:39,119
Are you going to take a flight back
just to repair it?

131
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,879
Besides, it's very dangerous to
take a plane these days.

132
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:42,479
The plane may just disappear.

133
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,599
It's not funny.

134
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:47,759
I was so smitten that
I forgot about the battery.

135
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:50,079
Forget it. Just give it to me.

136
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:53,399
Oh no, you met Justin.

137
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,519
Who is Justin?

138
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,759
Just destined to be sold out.

139
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,919
Can you stop taking advantage of me?

140
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,399
Don't you worry.

141
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,559
Write down your contact number for me.
Okay?

142
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,039
I will give you a call
once the battery stock is in.

143
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,199
You better not lie to me.

144
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,759
Otherwise you will have your retribution.

145
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:08,879
We can go for coffee and have a good time.

146
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:09,839
Lobang.

147
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:10,879
You calculated wrongly.

148
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:12,079
The boss just gave me a lashing.

149
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,679
You take this and add this. Hold on.

150
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,159
Take this and add this.

151
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,439
Take this and add this.

152
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,239
Deduct this and you'll get it.

153
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,719
Which unit is Ken going to?

154
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,479
Naval Diving Unit.

155
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,559
Lucky you.

156
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,399
Naval Driving Unit.

157
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,359
It's free and easy.
Just send people to their destination.

158
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,159
Stripping off, taking off shoes,

159
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,439
putting your legs up and shaking.

160
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,079
The kids are here, no vulgarities.

161
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,159
Shaking the butt.

162
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,159
When they are done, you send them back.

163
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,679
Such a easy life.

164
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,879
You're really son of a...

165
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,159
Lucky boy.

166
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,999
Uncle, listen to me.

167
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,679
I'm a diver.

168
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,799
Not a driver.

169
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,639
Diver and driver are just a letter short

170
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,599
but the responsibilities
are entirely different.

171
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,879
You got yourself in as a diver.

172
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:12,199
You can start digging a hole for yourself.

173
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:13,439
You can prepare to collect his bones.

174
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,759
Touch wood.

175
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,159
Brother.

176
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,679
What's for dinner tonight?

177
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:21,679
This is your school fees.

178
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,639
Do you have enough for yourself?

179
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,359
My business here is doing pretty well,
you don't have to worry about me.

180
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,959
That is because of the long queues
at the court.

181
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:32,639
It's all thanks to them.

182
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,799
Tomorrow is my enlistment day.

183
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:35,919
You have to take care for yourself.

184
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,159
Send me a message if there is anything.

185
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,759
I will fly out and save you, understand?

186
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,479
Are you sure?

187
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,159
Hey, I am in special force.
If I can't save you, then who can?

188
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,279
You know my friends told me.

189
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,479
That the Tekong BMT camp is very nice,
like a resort.

190
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:57,559
And all the facilities are very new.

191
00:12:57,719 --> 00:13:01,839
You look at this place, so old,
so run down, all colonial buildings.

192
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:05,439
Reminds me of the old Changi hospital,
so haunted.

193
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:07,079
Long.

194
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:10,999
Son.

195
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:13,359
Son, wait up for me.

196
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:14,999
I told you not to come.

197
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:17,479
Why do you have to be here
and pull a long face?

198
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,039
Like a funeral procession.

199
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,559
How can you talk to us like this?

200
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,399
You two are being a pain.

201
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,039
I never wanted to be here.

202
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:26,719
Now I have to serve the army.

203
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,439
I've also lost my friends in Hong Kong.

204
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,519
Your friends in Hong Kong
are all good for nothings.

205
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,959
One day you will end up in prison.

206
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:35,999
Prison? How is this different
from being in prison?

207
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:39,079
Let me tell you, if I really want to be bad.

208
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:40,359
Do you think you can stop me?

209
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,399
Look at them.

210
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:44,279
They are all my henchmen.

211
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:45,799
What can you do?

212
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,599
I am telling you to go be a soldier.

213
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,359
And stop associating with them.

214
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:52,239
I would rather stop associating myself
with you two.

215
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:53,999
You are the ones who wanted to migrate.

216
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:55,359
Then you should be the ones
getting enlisted.

217
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,159
Why should I pay for my father's choices?

218
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,239
Son, don't be like that.

219
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:03,639
Can you stop following me?

220
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,039
You're such a pain.

221
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,199
Let's go.

222
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:13,919
Let's go.

223
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:16,959
You better don't mess around with them.

224
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:20,079
No, son.
You should work with everybody here.

225
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,919
Teamwork and brotherhood
is very important here.

226
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,719
No worries, I've got my IQ and my EQ.

227
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,439
And I won't be having any enemies

228
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:29,319
because my only enemy in the NDU

229
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:31,039
is me. Myself.

230
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,759
-Right.
-Good boy.

231
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:36,959
Demolition trained.

232
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,079
Rough and rugged bunch of warriors.

233
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,999
There's nothing we can't do.

234
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:47,239
Nothing stands in our way.

235
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:49,279
Don't be crazy. Don't stand in my way.

236
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,879
This army camp looks different
from other army camps.

237
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:55,719
Frog. There is a frog with wings.

238
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,319
I think the officers from this camp

239
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,359
like to go Geylang for frog porridge.

240
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:06,839
You okay?

241
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,439
-Shut up.
-Okay.

242
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,239
After all the formalities,

243
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,919
CO speech,

244
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,759
parents asking dumb questions

245
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,039
and followed by CO replying
politically correct answers.

246
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:32,839
We are now officially NDU recruits

247
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,799
and my new phase of life begins.

248
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:37,399
Many people

249
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:39,759
including you recruits,

250
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,879
like to joke about NDU

251
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,999
as a No Discipline Unit.

252
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,079
But I can assure you

253
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,839
We are in fact, one of the most
discipline oriented military units.

254
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,199
Whatever.

255
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:55,759
You may choose not to believe it now.

256
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,239
But you will, eventually.

257
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,879
You are not ordinary soldiers.

258
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:07,359
You are combat divers,
amphibious frogmen, yet to be.

259
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:13,798
You will face high and demanding
standards from me.

260
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:19,119
Your path will not be smooth or easy.

261
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:21,478
But if we work together,

262
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:24,279
nothing stands in our way.

263
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:26,959
So gentlemen,

264
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:33,399
are you prepared to complete
this rite of passage with me?

265
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,639
Yes, sir.

266
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:37,479
In NDU,

267
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:41,319
you are required to have the best physical

268
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,279
and mental abilities.

269
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:47,239
Only the best, of the best, makes it.

270
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:50,799
BMT is a warm up.

271
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,359
To your combat diver course.

272
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:57,119
If you want to survive the CDC,
(CDC: combat diver course.)

273
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,079
you should give your all
throughout training.

274
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:02,919
Remember,

275
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,199
you are not the first

276
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,959
and you will never be the last.

277
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,559
-Clear?
-Yes, sir.

278
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,479
I will now hand you over
to your course warrant.

279
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:18,119
Third Warrant Alex Ong.

280
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,599
The whole lot of you

281
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:26,679
remove your shirts.

282
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,119
Which part of remove your shirts
do you not understand?

283
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:38,559
Shirts off now! Take it off.

284
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:45,039
You, step out.

285
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:45,999
Yes, sir.

286
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,919
Not you, but it's okay.

287
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,359
You stay there.

288
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,239
You, step out.

289
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,159
Yes, sir.

290
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,639
I want every single one of you

291
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:02,599
to take a clear and concise look

292
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:04,679
at your batch boys here.

293
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,759
Right now, most of you

294
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,399
look like this.

295
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:12,479
But by the end of the course,

296
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:17,119
I expect all of you to put in effort
to achieve and strive

297
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,839
to have a body that looks

298
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,119
like this.

299
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,559
Is my expectation too high?

300
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,679
No, sir.

301
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,239
Is my expectation too high?

302
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,559
No, sir.

303
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:29,239
Good.

304
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:30,879
Go back.

305
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:31,919
Yes, sir.

306
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,439
I want all of you to also remember.

307
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:38,519
The diver values.

308
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:40,079
Honor.

309
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:41,639
Integrity.

310
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:43,759
And last but not least...

311
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:44,959
Team spirit.

312
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:46,679
Bear that in mind.

313
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,519
Is that clear?

314
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:49,959
Yes, sir.

315
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,399
Drop.

316
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,479
Drop!

317
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,719
So many units in the SAF.

318
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:59,079
Suay suay kena sent to Sembawang Camp.

319
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,719
Don't understand why they gotta choose me.

320
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,679
To suffer under the sun in the sand and sea.

321
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,879
Why am I here? NDU.

322
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:10,719
Why they gotta choose me instead of you?

323
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:13,799
I wanna know. Why me?

324
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,559
From dawn to...

325
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,919
Regardless of which vocation you're in,

326
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:21,079
we still need to go through
basic military training.

327
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:23,239
That's why we wear the green number 4

328
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,719
even though we're from the Navy.

329
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,839
Bruises on our bodies, all black and blue.

330
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,719
No choice but to go on,
you know that's true.

331
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,919
Why am I here? NDU.

332
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,679
Why they gotta choose me instead of you?

333
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,799
I wanna know. Why me?

334
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,079
From dawn to dusk kena hammer PT.

335
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:23,319
48.

336
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,279
Strip weapon.

337
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:27,239
Strip weapon. Start.

338
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:33,879
Weapon stripped.

339
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:38,159
Aloysius, an excellent job well done.

340
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,359
You broke the record.

341
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:42,719
A perfect 10 seconds.

342
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:45,279
Sir, may I share my secret
with my batch mates?

343
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:47,159
Okay.

344
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,079
Step forward.

345
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,559
My secret is

346
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:51,119
remembering the steps

347
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:52,879
like I'm singing a rap.

348
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,359
Here we go.

349
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:58,679
Microphone check two one two. Let's go.

350
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,919
Remove the magazine and push the nut.

351
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,119
Pull up the butt and carrier
with the bolt still stuck

352
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:07,479
and whack the firing pin so hard
and it will fall apart.

353
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,079
Weapon stripped, sir.

354
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:12,439
Now that the whole lot
of you know his secret.

355
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:15,319
I expect every single one of you
to meet his timing.

356
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:16,559
A perfect

357
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,439
10 seconds.

358
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,119
You want to go OCS, that's your business.
(OCS: Officer Cadet School.)

359
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,279
Don't drag us in.

360
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:24,479
-Translate?
-Don't sabotage everyone.

361
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:27,359
Sorry, I was only doing my part and my best.

362
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:29,479
And actually, I wanted to share
my knowledge with you guys

363
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,199
so that you all can be as good as me.

364
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,399
Done. I don't know how it looks like
I'm sabotaging you all.

365
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:37,119
Before I came to the army,
someone once told me

366
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:39,799
in every unit,
they will have a Mr. Know-It-All.

367
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,199
I didn't believe then,
and now I ended up with one.

368
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,439
Can you stop trying so hard?

369
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,159
Didn't your mother teach you?

370
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,759
When the adults talk,
kids shouldn't interrupt.

371
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:47,759
You want to stick to the wall?

372
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:50,079
You better remember to take your medication.

373
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:51,479
Otherwise, you can't seem to figure out

374
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:52,679
who is the adult or child.

375
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,599
I didn't know that
your father copyrighted scolding.

376
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:56,239
Why are you the only one who can rebuke him?

377
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:58,039
Be smart, don't act smart.

378
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:00,639
Translate?

379
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,359
Ham Ka Chan!
(Ham Ka Chan: curse your family.)

380
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:04,559
Ham Ka Chan?

381
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:06,159
What does it mean?

382
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,959
-Over here.
-Wow.

383
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,799
Lobang, you are really like a mini mart.

384
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,759
Don't look down on my mini mart,
this is my NDUC.

385
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:22,639
NTUC?

386
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,839
NDUC, Naval Diving Unit Cafe.

387
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:27,639
Remember to write down whatever you take.

388
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:28,919
Don't try to take advantage of me.

389
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:29,999
Guys.

390
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:32,999
Have you heard of this
psycho instructor called No. 2?

391
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:34,599
No. 2?

392
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:36,279
You've also heard of No. 2?

393
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:38,519
That means No. 2 is very famous in NDU.

394
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:39,999
Who cares about No. 2?

395
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,679
I thought the scary one
should be number one.

396
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:42,999
Yes, why is he called No. 2?

397
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,519
He is so called No. 2 because

398
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:47,559
he is a very famous
but notorious course warrant in NDU.

399
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,479
And?

400
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:51,079
He is also the second longest
record holder in the SAF

401
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:53,239
to dive without an oxygen tank.

402
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:56,039
And due to the water pressure

403
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,199
his facial nerves are dead,

404
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,639
leaving him with only one perpetual look.

405
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,759
Grandma flirty. Parents crazy.
Friends in trouble.

406
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,319
Strike 4D. Strike Toto. Strike Big Sweep.

407
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,999
Ancestors' Day. Christmas Day.
Valentine's Day.

408
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:15,279
But one lucky thing,

409
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:16,599
I heard he has been posted out.

410
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,479
Lucky us.

411
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,599
What a waste.

412
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:23,599
Didn't even take his chance to downgrade.

413
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:24,799
Stupid fellow.

414
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:26,439
Lobang.

415
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,719
Why do you have an
unlimited supply of titbits?

416
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:29,839
You got these from the canteen?

417
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,999
Don't utter rubbish!
We are not allowed to go canteen.

418
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,999
This is my business secret,
not for you to know.

419
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:37,079
Gentlemen, just a friendly reminder.

420
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:39,879
All these are junk food.
It's very bad for your health.

421
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:42,559
But once in a while it's okay.

422
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:43,919
Goodnight. Sweet dreams.

423
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,679
Go sleep.

424
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,439
Alright guys.

425
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,079
What you are going to learn today
is something called Drown Proofing.

426
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:54,479
This is the ultimate test of
a diver's water confidence.

427
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,599
Go.

428
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:18,079
Airway. Check for breathing.

429
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,399
1, 2, 3, 4, 10.

430
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:29,199
Okay guys.

431
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,599
You all can laugh, you all can joke.

432
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:32,799
But you all better pay attention.

433
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:34,199
This is a matter of life and death.

434
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,159
Take it seriously.

435
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,559
Okay guys.

436
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:38,759
All of you have observed
the demonstration earlier.

437
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,239
Right now we will commence with training.

438
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,119
Are you all ready?

439
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:42,039
Yes, sir.

440
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:45,199
The first pair I want, Rocky

441
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,919
and Hanrey.

442
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,359
Come.

443
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,719
Hey, what is this?

444
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,639
This is not Man Hunt. Want to drop?

445
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,199
-Get into position.
-Yes, sir.

446
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:05,279
1, 2, 3, 4, 30.

447
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:10,559
The next pair I want

448
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,479
Hei-long

449
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:14,279
and

450
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:16,279
Lobang.

451
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:18,159
Sir.

452
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:20,199
You can pair me with anyone but not him.

453
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:21,719
-I don't want to pair with you either.
-What do you want?

454
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,839
What do you think this is? Matchmaking.

455
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:26,239
You want to be a diver,
you have to learn to work together.

456
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,559
In future when you go for ops,

457
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,959
are you only going work
with the person you like?

458
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:30,639
No, sir.

459
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:35,799
Go down.

460
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:38,759
You go.

461
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:40,199
Yes, sir.

462
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,319
1, 2, 3, 4, 25.

463
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:45,159
1, 2, 3, 4, 30.

464
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,279
What the hell you think you are doing?

465
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:54,239
What are you trying to do?

466
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:56,919
Sir, he spat into my mouth.

467
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,119
It was an accident.

468
00:25:58,879 --> 00:25:59,679
Accident?

469
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,639
Let me show all of you
what is a real accident.

470
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:06,919
Since you guys don't know
how to work together as a team.

471
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:10,679
Today I will make sure
you learn the hard way.

472
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,519
Hello.

473
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:34,999
My business is damn good,
bring me more goods.

474
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:37,319
I will wait for you downstairs.

475
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:38,599
Okay.

476
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:44,559
(Mom took the money you gave me
for my school fees.)

477
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:46,319
(I can't pay for my school fees now.)

478
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:54,639
Another round?

479
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,159
Let's go to bed.

480
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,359
Sleep? Let's have another round.

481
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,119
What is that?

482
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:20,559
Poker cards.

483
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,079
Why?

484
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,399
Casino night?

485
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,119
No, sir.

486
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,119
These cards are for

487
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:28,159
fortune telling.

488
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,199
Fortune telling.

489
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,799
Fortune telling.

490
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,999
Okay Mr. Fortune Teller.

491
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,799
Tell my fortune.

492
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,439
Sir.

493
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:53,959
Please take a card.

494
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:56,399
You probably think
I am going to pick the centre.

495
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,279
I will go with this.

496
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,319
The meaning of this card is...

497
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,759
You offended the Lone Star.

498
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,199
Destined with no offsprings.

499
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,599
And will live your life in solitary.

500
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:16,919
I don't understand.

501
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:18,879
Can you explain in layman terms?

502
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:22,199
It means Ham Ka Chan.

503
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:23,879
Ham Ka Chan?

504
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:24,839
Yeah.

505
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:26,279
What does it mean?

506
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:29,679
Ham Ka Chan.

507
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:31,599
I don't know.

508
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:33,479
I know Chan Mali Chan.

509
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:36,919
Ham Ka Chan.

510
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,039
It sounds like a combination of

511
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,159
humble,

512
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,079
courageous

513
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:44,279
and

514
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,439
charming.

515
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,359
Ham Ka Chan.

516
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,319
Sounds good.

517
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:54,159
Ham Ka Chan.

518
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:57,919
Actually, I'm like that since young.

519
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,239
It's in my blood.

520
00:28:59,879 --> 00:29:00,839
But now,

521
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,239
I want you to tell me.

522
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:06,119
What is the fortune of this entire cabin

523
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:07,799
in one minute?

524
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,919
Come...

525
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,599
The four of you stop groaning and sulking.

526
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,639
Just push it out.

527
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:24,679
You deserve it.

528
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,599
Down.

529
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,319
For one.

530
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:31,999
So how Hei-long?

531
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,679
You like your fortune so far?

532
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,359
Ham Ka Chan better right?

533
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,039
Up...

534
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:44,239
Permission to recover, sir.

535
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,199
On your feet.

536
00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:47,879
48.

537
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,319
I'll give you all the benefit
of the doubt today.

538
00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:53,319
But don't ever let me find
any more poker cards

539
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,439
or gambling materials in my cabins.

540
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,879
If I do, bear in mind.

541
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:00,639
I will hammer the daylights
out of every single one of you.

542
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:01,679
Clear?

543
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,399
Yes, sir.

544
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:14,039
Fortune telling! You are really good.

545
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,199
We almost lost our lives
to your fortune telling.

546
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:17,759
Fortune telling.

547
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:20,879
If it wasn't you who was walking
like a hairy crab.

548
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:22,239
I wouldn't have dropped my cards.

549
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:24,279
Idiots like you in Hong Kong.

550
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,439
I have beaten several.

551
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,639
Hong Kong mafia?

552
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,439
You are in Singapore now,
don't make me laugh.

553
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,759
The fierce tiger will never be
as good as a local tyrant.

554
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:30,919
Didn't your mother teach you?

555
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,039
I have only heard of brave dragon crossing.

556
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:35,399
Come on!

557
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,519
Forget it.

558
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:40,519
I'll make you stick to the wall.

559
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:47,039
Forget it.

560
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,999
Don't bother with such hooligans.

561
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,119
Sorry I had a tummy ache.

562
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,239
Is everything okay?

563
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,039
Your friend?

564
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,439
Your cabin mate.

565
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,559
If you didn't hold me back,

566
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,079
I would beat him into a pulp.

567
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,279
Cool down.

568
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,319
Hello.

569
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,799
Watch my back.

570
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,959
Where are you?

571
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:27,719
Throw between the two trees.

572
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,439
Go.

573
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:42,879
Eating the bread here is indeed different
from eating it outside.

574
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:44,639
Yeah, it's really different.

575
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:48,319
What made you so irritable?

576
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,959
That fellow is getting intemperate.

577
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:52,799
That's all?

578
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,039
Something happened at home.

579
00:31:56,719 --> 00:31:57,759
Short of a few hundred dollars.

580
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,239
I'm stuck in this camp
and can't do anything about it.

581
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:01,479
It doesn't help that
he keeps getting on my back.

582
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,279
Few hundred dollars isn't much.

583
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:06,039
Money is not a problem.

584
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,799
Money is not a problem. But I have no money.

585
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,319
I can lend it to you first.

586
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:11,559
Really?

587
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,159
But I charge high interest.

588
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,519
Just joking.

589
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,119
Today is our book out day.

590
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,799
Book out. Book out.

591
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:32,559
Today is our book out day.

592
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:34,199
Book out, book out day. Hey!

593
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,919
Today is our book out day.

594
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,679
Book out. Book out.

595
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,359
Today is our book out day.

596
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:41,239
Book out, book out day. Hey!

597
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,919
Where is Ken? I can't see him.

598
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,119
They all look so tanned.

599
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:48,279
And they are all wearing the same clothes.

600
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,559
Of course, they are wearing uniforms.

601
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,759
Why don't we get down the car
and look for him?

602
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:54,239
Okay.

603
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,399
Ken.

604
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,639
Boss.

605
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:07,639
Are the things ready?

606
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,319
I ate durians last night.

607
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:11,199
Here is a good mix of both solid and liquid.

608
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,719
This is my first brew.

609
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,319
Wicked.

610
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:17,959
Mom. Have you found Amy?

611
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,439
You think your mom is a police post
or information counter?

612
00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:22,919
Can't you just help me?

613
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,079
She has helped you for two weeks,
isn't that enough?

614
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:27,999
That's enough. Drive.

615
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:30,599
Bad Maria.

616
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:31,639
Don't sabotage me.

617
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:34,599
Ken. Let's go home.

618
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,999
Cow touncil?

619
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:39,959
Is this cow touncil?

620
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,679
No, I mean town council.

621
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:46,039
That No. 126 lamp post in front of
the market is not working.

622
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,679
Please get someone to repair it.

623
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,639
Otherwise it is very dangerous at night.

624
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:52,639
You know about it.

625
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,239
Don't make me call you again.

626
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:56,639
The next time I'll call straight
to the Prime Minister's office.

627
00:33:56,879 --> 00:33:57,679
Start the action.

628
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,359
Which one is he?

629
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:01,239
Okay good.

630
00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:03,639
The one who is making a call
in front of the lamp post.

631
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:04,639
Yes, sir.

632
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:07,079
Everything is good.

633
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:08,399
That one in front of the lamp post?

634
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:09,319
Yes.

635
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,199
They just booked out.

636
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,239
The one on the phone?

637
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:13,759
Yes.

638
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:20,359
Alright, sir.

639
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:24,839
Oh shit.

640
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,199
Panther.

641
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,319
No.

642
00:34:34,799 --> 00:34:35,399
Yes.

643
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:39,119
This is my boss in NDU.

644
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:41,599
Your boss in NDU?

645
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,679
Yes.

646
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:45,319
Isn't he that Wang?

647
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:46,959
My surname is Wang.

648
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:47,879
Alex Ong.

649
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:49,719
What is this?

650
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:52,559
Herbal tea from Hong Kong.

651
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,239
Herbal tea from Hong Kong?

652
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:55,239
Homemade?

653
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:56,439
Yeah, homemade.

654
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,439
Is it nice?

655
00:34:58,279 --> 00:34:59,759
Yes, very nice.

656
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:00,639
Have you tried it?

657
00:35:00,759 --> 00:35:01,559
Yes.

658
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:02,599
And you?

659
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:04,719
-I have not tried before.
-You can try.

660
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,039
Now.

661
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,279
-I try?
-Yes.

662
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:08,479
-I try it now?
-You try it now.

663
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:09,959
-I try it now?
-Drink it.

664
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,039
-I try it now?
-Yes.

665
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:14,239
Hurry.

666
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:27,279
How?

667
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,039
Delicious?

668
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:32,479
This is damn delicious.

669
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,319
What are you doing?

670
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,519
I almost got sabotaged by you, idiot.

671
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,079
You want to splash urine on my officer.

672
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:42,799
How am I going to spend
the rest of my days here?

673
00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:44,039
What the hell were you doing?

674
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,599
Can you try to be smarter next time?

675
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,199
I will try.

676
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:53,839
(Welcome...)
You wrote the word home wrongly.

677
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,519
I don't have a home.
Hence I don't know that word.

678
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,319
Can't you tidy up the place?

679
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:00,639
This place is a mess.

680
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:04,119
-Panther.
-Coming.

681
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,759
What's up boss?

682
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:07,639
Isn't this what I ate
before I went in the camp?

683
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:08,639
Why is this still here?

684
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:09,799
Oh damn.

685
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,879
How can I forget this?

686
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:13,239
Sorry boss.

687
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,879
I have been very busy lately.

688
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:18,399
You know, there are things
happening on our turf.

689
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:21,439
Those kids start to owe us membership fees.

690
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:22,959
And there is this new guy.

691
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:23,999
Called Wild Boar.

692
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:27,839
He is vicious and merciless.

693
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:31,599
I found out that the rest
have became his followers.

694
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:33,959
You peabrain, there is no need to be afraid.

695
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,799
You go get rid of him.

696
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,599
If the rest try to be funny,

697
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:38,799
beat them up.

698
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,039
Oh yes boss.

699
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:44,159
Your mom brought this soup
here this morning.

700
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:45,079
My mom?

701
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:46,479
I don't want.

702
00:36:46,759 --> 00:36:48,519
What else does she know besides making soup?

703
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,199
She thinks I will forgive her by doing this.

704
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:52,319
They think I am a fool.

705
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,279
Boss, don't be like this.

706
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:55,359
Drink some.

707
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:57,039
You are putting me in a difficult position.

708
00:36:58,399 --> 00:36:59,439
I am telling you I am not drinking this.

709
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:01,239
Drink it if you want.

710
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:03,999
I drank some just now.

711
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,119
Come on, just have a little.

712
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,119
Why are you so concerned with this?

713
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:10,919
Did my mother bribe you?

714
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:13,279
No. No.

715
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:14,359
No?

716
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,879
If I say no, then I'm really lying.

717
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,559
This is yours.

718
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:22,479
I don't want.

719
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:24,199
Then I've gained an extra thousand?

720
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:25,439
One thousand dollars?

721
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,119
Give it back.
I'm going to spend off all her money.

722
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,479
Eighty cents.

723
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:33,679
Thank you.

724
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:39,439
What happened to your hair?
They're all gone.

725
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,839
We all look like that in the army.

726
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,159
The town council is very efficient.

727
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:43,479
They repaired this right after I called.

728
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:45,319
Yes, you are very efficient too.

729
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:46,559
What did you tell them?

730
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,439
I told them my sister can't do her
homework without the streetlight.

731
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,639
Hence they sent someone to repair this.

732
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:50,679
Bullshit.

733
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:52,239
Let me touch your head again.

734
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:53,599
Eat your dinner.

735
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:56,759
How was your training?

736
00:37:56,879 --> 00:37:57,959
Is it tough?

737
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:00,359
Did you get drilled?

738
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,879
How do you know about this word?

739
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:03,719
I learned it from watching Ah Boys To Men.

740
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:05,919
Their terms in the army
is different from us.

741
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,519
Their tekan to us is hammer.

742
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,279
Their fall in to us is muster.

743
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:10,839
Their bunk to us is cabin.

744
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:11,839
Our meal time is called chow.

745
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:12,759
So chow now.

746
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:13,799
Chow.

747
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:14,759
Lobang.

748
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:15,719
What are you doing here?

749
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,799
-Your girlfriend?
-She is my sister.

750
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:19,759
Your sister.

751
00:38:19,879 --> 00:38:21,199
Hi, I am Wei-ming.

752
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:22,199
I am Lowei.

753
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:24,119
Lowei, I am Wei-ming.

754
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:26,879
I am Lobang.
What do you think you are doing?

755
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,239
Oh yes.

756
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:30,119
This is what I promised you.

757
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,039
Dowry.

758
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,239
Dowry for my mother?

759
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:35,879
No need for so much to marry your mom.

760
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:38,079
This is for your sister.
Didn't you promise me?

761
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,399
Nonsense! Since when was there a promise?

762
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:40,719
Fat hope.

763
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,039
Can you give me your number?

764
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,479
Hey, I'm still here!

765
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:45,639
I am just joking, my mother is calling me.

766
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,879
Hello mother, I am coming.

767
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:50,239
Thank you.

768
00:38:50,399 --> 00:38:51,799
Bye, Lowei.

769
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:53,239
Bye, Lowei.

770
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,119
You only know how to say bye to Lowei.

771
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,079
What about Lobang?

772
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,519
Hey, I will get your number
from your brother.

773
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:57,759
Get out of here.

774
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,119
Eat your dinner, don't bother with him.

775
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,799
Is there any food? I am hungry.

776
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:03,119
Over here mom, sit down and eat.

777
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:06,039
Brother, I will share mine with you.

778
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:07,239
It's okay, you eat that.

779
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,879
Do you have any money? Give me some.

780
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:11,639
Didn't I just give you some money.
Where did it go?

781
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,239
Since when did you give me money?

782
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:15,639
Didn't I do so the other day?

783
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:19,039
Since when? See for yourself, where?

784
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:27,079
No wonder you look intoxicated.

785
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,799
Do you know you will be jailed for this?

786
00:39:29,439 --> 00:39:33,599
Listen to me.

787
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,399
Stop it! Listen to me.

788
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:38,319
Stop it, I will return you.
You have to be careful.

789
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,479
Without this,
I wouldn't have survived until now.

790
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:49,879
I caused your father's death.

791
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:53,959
If I hadn't make that turn,
everything will be fine.

792
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,439
It's me who cause your father's death.

793
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:58,519
No, that was an accident.

794
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:00,799
It has nothing to do with you.
You didn't do any wrong.

795
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:02,439
You didn't do...

796
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:07,919
Mom.

797
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:10,119
I am in the army and Lowei is still young.

798
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:12,119
What do you want me to do?

799
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:13,759
Mom, listen to me.

800
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:29,319
All your cousins are so proud of you
for being selected as a naval diver.

801
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:31,399
They will give you a surprise later.

802
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,879
Batch 48 attention.

803
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:41,759
48 stand still.

804
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:44,079
Good evening, sir.

805
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:44,999
Good evening.

806
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,279
48 IC reporting.

807
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:49,479
Strength 100, present 100.
Permission to carry on, sir.

808
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,519
Carry on.

809
00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:53,279
48. At ease.

810
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:00,359
Diver Ken Chow. Hooyah.

811
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,239
Welcome diver Ken Chow.

812
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:06,679
Impressive. How do you guys know about this?

813
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:07,639
Google, sir.

814
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:09,439
Good but not good enough.

815
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,639
Everyone, drop 20.

816
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:12,919
Yes, sir.

817
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:15,719
They are only kids.

818
00:41:15,879 --> 00:41:17,639
This is what I do in camp everyday.

819
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:19,159
Every minute, every second.

820
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:20,319
Life is harsh.

821
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:23,639
Does this look like fun to you?

822
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,439
Busybody.

823
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:26,479
They're not bad.

824
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,119
Uncle.

825
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:30,999
Brother, we miss you.

826
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,199
Miss you.

827
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:35,359
Sis, this is the first time
my nephew booked out from camp.

828
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:36,879
The whole place feels so crowded and festive

829
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:38,479
like the Ghost Festival.

830
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:39,759
We are just short of a stage with singer.

831
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:41,479
Didn't I invite you, the singer?

832
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,519
Okay.

833
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:44,479
If today is the Ghost Festival,

834
00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:46,479
then you must be that hungry ghost.

835
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:48,519
How can you call me a hungry ghost?

836
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,919
I didn't come empty handed today.

837
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:51,639
I am here to bring you good fortune.

838
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,119
Yeah right.

839
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:54,719
Sis, I really brought the good fortune here.

840
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:58,239
This is the latest rice dispenser.

841
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:00,879
It not only contains rice.

842
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:02,879
It also contains all good blessings

843
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:05,919
and bring good fortune to your whole family.

844
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:09,319
Thank you. You better eat more tonight.

845
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:12,599
Hubby, get him some beer.

846
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:13,679
Let's have a drink.

847
00:42:17,479 --> 00:42:19,679
Come and have some food.

848
00:42:23,879 --> 00:42:25,719
What happened to your hand?

849
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,719
Did they torture you in the NDU?

850
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,519
This is all part of the training.

851
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:30,999
Don't you know it is tough in NDU?

852
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:33,719
Sis, there are more here.

853
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:36,959
Wait. I need to take photos of these

854
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:38,959
and send in a complaint.

855
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:41,919
I can tell the training must be hard
just by looking at these.

856
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:43,999
And no matter how hard the training can be.

857
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:47,159
After they passed out, they'll be made to
fish corpses from the river

858
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:50,599
and clear clogs in the canals.

859
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,439
There are only two words to describe.

860
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:54,079
-What?
-Shit job.

861
00:42:54,279 --> 00:42:55,679
Thanks uncle.

862
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,439
Did you get your facts right?

863
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:58,679
Those were long time ago.

864
00:42:58,799 --> 00:43:00,279
Times are different now.

865
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,039
Our NDU now is as good
as the Navy Seals in US.

866
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:06,479
They are the special force.

867
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:10,239
Only 0.1 percent of the Singapore
population is selected.

868
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:12,799
And my son is one of them.

869
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:13,879
You must be so proud then.

870
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:15,719
Get smart.

871
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,039
Let's drink.

872
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,919
What beer is this? It tastes good.

873
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:27,199
This is called Dester beer. That's the beer.

874
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:29,719
Where have you been?

875
00:43:29,879 --> 00:43:30,839
Why do you only call me now?

876
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,279
I have been trying to reach you
for the past two weeks.

877
00:43:33,399 --> 00:43:34,439
Where the hell have you been?

878
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:36,839
I have been calling you,
texting you day and night.

879
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:38,759
Why are you ignoring me?

880
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:40,159
Don't you know I am in NDU?

881
00:43:40,399 --> 00:43:42,239
The toughest unit in the universe.

882
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:43,719
How can you do this to me?

883
00:43:43,919 --> 00:43:47,759
The reason why
I am calling you now is because

884
00:43:47,879 --> 00:43:49,079
I have made up my mind.

885
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:53,159
Let's break up.

886
00:43:53,279 --> 00:43:54,079
Break up with me?

887
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:56,559
How can you betray me like that?

888
00:43:56,959 --> 00:43:58,679
Do you know that every inch of my being

889
00:43:58,799 --> 00:44:00,679
is in pain because of NDU training?

890
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:02,239
And now you want to break my heart too?

891
00:44:02,479 --> 00:44:04,759
I need someone who is stronger.

892
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:08,839
Who is able to protect me,
love me, care about me

893
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:11,439
and understand my feelings.

894
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:13,479
I need someone who is more determined

895
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:14,639
and more mature.

896
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:16,799
You are too childish for me.

897
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:20,279
Just break up, let it go.

898
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:21,919
You have been watching too much movies

899
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:23,999
because the person doesn't even exist.

900
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,079
Even if you go to factories and
try to tailor make, he doesn't exist.

901
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,199
Get that into your head.

902
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,479
How dare you. Pick up.

903
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,999
Pick up.

904
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:47,479
Shit.

905
00:44:57,519 --> 00:44:59,679
Just stay calm.

906
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:02,679
This is like a mutiny. It's common.

907
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:04,879
What's more important now is...

908
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:07,639
You have to buck up
and carry on with your training.

909
00:45:07,799 --> 00:45:09,639
Such things will go by in a flash.

910
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,359
You will forget about this
before you even know it.

911
00:45:13,799 --> 00:45:16,079
I hate NS.
(NS: National Service.)

912
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:17,359
Everything will be fine.

913
00:45:17,479 --> 00:45:20,039
Let me give you a way out of this.

914
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:22,039
Ask him to sign on
with Air Force and be a pilot.

915
00:45:22,279 --> 00:45:23,759
Why does he need to be a pilot?

916
00:45:23,879 --> 00:45:25,719
It's a way to get out of NDU.

917
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,239
Are you sure?

918
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,359
Of course, many people
have thought of this before.

919
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,279
Sir.

920
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,919
After serious consideration, I have decided.

921
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:38,479
I want to join the Air Force
to be a fighter pilot.

922
00:45:38,799 --> 00:45:40,639
I want to fly, not swim.

923
00:45:42,879 --> 00:45:44,079
Good future, Ken Chow.

924
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,079
Thank you, sir.

925
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:46,039
I think so too.

926
00:45:46,759 --> 00:45:48,559
I will inform the OC first thing
tomorrow morning.

927
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:50,559
But a gentle reminder to you.

928
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,919
While you are still here,

929
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,039
you will still have to follow with
every single training.

930
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:56,679
No excuses.

931
00:45:56,919 --> 00:45:57,719
Understand me?

932
00:45:57,999 --> 00:45:58,879
Yes, sir.

933
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:00,879
Get lost.

934
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:02,119
Thank you, sir.

935
00:46:12,759 --> 00:46:14,159
48. Hurry up. Muster.

936
00:46:15,479 --> 00:46:17,119
Lobang, is it red enough?

937
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:19,239
Can you stop doing this?

938
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,279
Each time you said you are sick,
no one believes you.

939
00:46:21,399 --> 00:46:22,959
You need talent to act.

940
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:23,999
Plus the fact that you are so big sized.

941
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:24,959
Even acting skills can't help you.

942
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:26,759
Hurry up. Muster.

943
00:46:27,759 --> 00:46:28,719
Muster.

944
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,679
Ken. Don't mind,
I'll share something with you.

945
00:46:40,279 --> 00:46:42,679
Let me share with you
what I learned from tuition.

946
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:43,599
Tuition?

947
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:45,959
Yes, Special Force tuition.

948
00:46:46,279 --> 00:46:48,719
Number one, focus on your training.

949
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,599
Number two, teamwork.

950
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,079
Don't sabotage your batch mates
is also considered as teamwork.

951
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,559
Are you referring to yourself?

952
00:46:56,679 --> 00:46:58,559
No, I'm just sharing
what I learned from tuition.

953
00:46:58,679 --> 00:46:59,919
I am just sharing the tips.

954
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:02,439
Don't worry, be happy.

955
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:03,959
Not war, make love.

956
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,079
With you?

957
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:06,519
No, please don't get me wrong.

958
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:07,639
It's with us.

959
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:10,759
Aloysius, don't make me laugh.

960
00:47:10,959 --> 00:47:13,519
Yeah, the pot calling the kettle black.

961
00:47:20,759 --> 00:47:23,919
Warrant Ong.

962
00:47:24,439 --> 00:47:26,839
Hooyah Warrant Ong.

963
00:47:27,399 --> 00:47:28,199
Hooyah.

964
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:34,879
Okay 48, before we go for training,

965
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:36,039
is anyone not feeling well?

966
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:37,359
No, sir.

967
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,239
Sir.

968
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:40,839
I think I may have a bit of sore eyes.

969
00:47:41,999 --> 00:47:42,959
Ken Chow.

970
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,719
Last night pilot.

971
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:46,799
This morning sore eyes.

972
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:48,919
Since you are such a sick little duckling,

973
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,519
while the rest of 48 goes for training,

974
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,159
you will stand in this position
for the next 15 minutes.

975
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:56,439
After the time ends,
if there is still soreness in your eyes,

976
00:47:56,759 --> 00:47:57,999
I will release you to the MO.
(MO: Medical Officer.)

977
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:01,599
I need one volunteer

978
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:04,679
to make intimate eye contact
with Mr. Ken Chow here

979
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:08,159
to verify the soreness of his eyes
and escort him to the MO later.

980
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:09,479
Any volunteers?

981
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:11,159
Me, sir.

982
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:14,239
Aloysius, why is it always you?

983
00:48:14,439 --> 00:48:15,479
The whole batch 48 only has one guy?

984
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,879
Yes. No.

985
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:20,399
48, no team spirit right?

986
00:48:20,919 --> 00:48:21,759
Except for you.

987
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,119
Whole lot drop.

988
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:29,199
Sir, I will drop too. Team spirit.

989
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,079
Down.

990
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:34,359
1, 2...

991
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:41,679
Today is day one of your
Combat Diver Course.

992
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:43,999
The paddle presented to you

993
00:48:44,439 --> 00:48:47,399
signifies that you are now
a new breed of men.

994
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:52,799
Let honor, integrity
and team spirit be your guide.

995
00:48:53,479 --> 00:48:56,999
I wish all of you the best of luck
in your CDC.

996
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:00,359
I will now hand you over
to your course Warrant

997
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:03,959
who is more than capable to train,

998
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:08,119
motivate and guide each and everyone of you.

999
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:11,839
He is non other than Second Warrant B T Lum.

1000
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:13,159
Call sign

1001
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:14,159
No. 2.

1002
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:26,839
I thought he is gone. What is he doing here?

1003
00:49:27,919 --> 00:49:28,759
Damn.

1004
00:49:28,879 --> 00:49:29,679
Sir.

1005
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:33,519
They are all yours, Lum.

1006
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:34,439
Thank you, sir.

1007
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:40,479
48.

1008
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,759
I heard that you are a bunch of dirtbags

1009
00:49:44,879 --> 00:49:46,599
with a lot of clowns in it.

1010
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,879
If you think BMT was tough,

1011
00:49:50,439 --> 00:49:51,439
you better think again.

1012
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,439
Because in CDC

1013
00:49:53,959 --> 00:49:56,159
the only easy day was yesterday.

1014
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:01,039
The training in CDC
is much tougher than BMT.

1015
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:03,719
It is more physical and mentally demanding.

1016
00:50:03,879 --> 00:50:06,199
And the instructors here are all crazy.

1017
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:08,839
They push us to our
maximum limit all the time.

1018
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:12,599
No. 2 said, the only easy day was yesterday.

1019
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:15,799
Even for a person so well prepared, like me.

1020
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:19,759
I could feel that the toughest day
is the following day.

1021
00:50:20,359 --> 00:50:23,159
I really can't imagine for the other
unprepared people.

1022
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:26,679
CDC to me now is...

1023
00:50:26,799 --> 00:50:28,399
Confirm die course.

1024
00:50:36,399 --> 00:50:37,239
Shag?

1025
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:39,279
I can control one batch single-handedly.

1026
00:50:39,399 --> 00:50:40,759
Eight of you can't even control a boat.

1027
00:50:40,879 --> 00:50:41,759
What's wrong with you?

1028
00:50:42,799 --> 00:50:44,399
Tired?

1029
00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:46,439
How about giving you two more people?

1030
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:48,439
-Can you?
-Can.

1031
00:50:48,919 --> 00:50:49,879
Of course can.

1032
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:54,719
Damn You. You short-lived bastard.

1033
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:56,319
Incompetent idiot.

1034
00:50:56,439 --> 00:50:57,719
Ham Ka Chan.

1035
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,799
If I don't stick you on the wall,
I'll change my name.

1036
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:04,359
Don't think about it.

1037
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:07,079
Let's go work out and it will be fine.

1038
00:51:08,439 --> 00:51:11,959
I didn't feel good at all
when I was up on the boat.

1039
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,039
I felt so guilty.

1040
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,479
Shut up. Stop talking.

1041
00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:18,239
You are really asking for it.

1042
00:51:18,479 --> 00:51:20,959
If it was the past,
you would be invited to a party.

1043
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:22,879
-What party?
-Blanket party.

1044
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:14,559
Hello?

1045
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:17,399
Guys?

1046
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:19,799
Anyone around?

1047
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:37,719
Open up, stop playing.

1048
00:52:38,279 --> 00:52:39,479
If the instructor sees me naked,

1049
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:40,959
we will all be punished.

1050
00:52:41,879 --> 00:52:42,879
Hurry up, open.

1051
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:50,599
Guys, please open the door. Stop playing.

1052
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:54,119
If the instructor sees me,
we'll be punished for nothing again.

1053
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,279
Please open the door. I am sorry.

1054
00:52:57,559 --> 00:52:58,319
Yes?

1055
00:52:58,439 --> 00:52:59,279
Thank you.

1056
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:04,959
Please open the lock.

1057
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:06,599
I want to open the cupboard
and take my clothes.

1058
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,039
Please give me my keys.

1059
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,679
Please guys, I sincerely
apologise to all of you.

1060
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:19,239
I know I sabotage you guys just now.

1061
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:21,519
I didn't do it on purpose.

1062
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:23,999
I promise I won't do it again.
Hei-long please.

1063
00:53:24,999 --> 00:53:26,279
You know it's not my fault.

1064
00:53:26,479 --> 00:53:27,999
Not your fault? So it's mine?

1065
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:29,319
No, it's my fault.

1066
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:31,359
You idiot. Listen carefully.

1067
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:32,799
If you sabotage us one more time,

1068
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:33,799
one more time,

1069
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,439
I will throw your keys
onto the parade square

1070
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:37,479
and make you go run and pick that up naked.

1071
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:38,879
-You understand?
-Okay.

1072
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:40,679
Stupid fool.

1073
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:50,959
Hi guys, thank you.

1074
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:54,039
Actually I just want you all to know that

1075
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:59,079
I've learned a very valuable lesson
from each one of you today.

1076
00:53:59,399 --> 00:54:02,319
And it has helped me in my growing up.

1077
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:06,599
If you don't mind,

1078
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:09,119
Warrant Ong has warned us before

1079
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:10,719
there is no gambling.

1080
00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:11,719
Shut up.

1081
00:54:12,439 --> 00:54:13,839
-In cabin.
-Shut up.

1082
00:54:14,439 --> 00:54:16,359
Okay, I'll shut up.

1083
00:54:16,479 --> 00:54:18,879
Sorry, just to let you guys know.

1084
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:22,359
I am the best batch mate that you can trust.

1085
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:26,559
I know that you guys love your game and

1086
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:27,839
I support.

1087
00:54:28,359 --> 00:54:30,879
I will be pretending to read
my book outside.

1088
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,279
I will be your lookout

1089
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:34,679
in case instructors come
and spot check on us.

1090
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:36,799
I will make sure you guys
get to play in a safe

1091
00:54:36,919 --> 00:54:38,359
and friendly environment.

1092
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:39,359
Hooyah.

1093
00:54:40,919 --> 00:54:42,719
Get out.

1094
00:54:51,279 --> 00:54:52,239
Cards.

1095
00:55:06,879 --> 00:55:08,919
Walao Ong.

1096
00:55:10,919 --> 00:55:13,439
Hooyah Warrant Ong.

1097
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:15,559
Good evening, sir.

1098
00:55:19,799 --> 00:55:20,799
You called me old man Ong?

1099
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,159
Do I look like your father?

1100
00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:23,319
No, it's Warrant Ong.

1101
00:55:23,959 --> 00:55:25,999
Something fishy must be going on.

1102
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:27,679
On your feet.

1103
00:55:30,279 --> 00:55:33,839
So gentlemen, what nonsense
are you up to today?

1104
00:55:33,959 --> 00:55:35,359
-Smoking?
-No, sir.

1105
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:36,759
-Pornography?
-No, sir.

1106
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:37,679
Outside food?

1107
00:55:37,799 --> 00:55:38,599
No, sir.

1108
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:42,119
I'll give you my words as a gentleman.

1109
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:43,119
I swear to God that

1110
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,839
they are not doing any of those things.

1111
00:55:44,959 --> 00:55:46,639
And they are also not gambling.

1112
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,599
Gambling.

1113
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,399
So, what were they doing?

1114
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:55,279
We were singing hymns.

1115
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,319
Bible reading and making prayers.

1116
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,719
And evoking the blessing of God
for each one of us

1117
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:01,679
to pass the upcoming team building week.

1118
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:03,639
So holy.

1119
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,479
We even shared some inspiring
and meaningful bible stories

1120
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:10,559
like this one.

1121
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,919
Don't be shy.

1122
00:56:15,479 --> 00:56:17,159
I am about to share with you...

1123
00:56:17,279 --> 00:56:18,719
Moses opened the Red Sea.

1124
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:26,239
Isn't this a bible?

1125
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:28,759
I can still explain.

1126
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:31,959
I suck.

1127
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:37,159
Hurry up.

1128
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:45,399
What the hell are you doing?

1129
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:46,559
Boat One and Two.

1130
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:48,879
It is obvious that you guys are showing me

1131
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:51,319
you are taking my kindness as a weakness.

1132
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:53,799
I don't care who you think you are outside.

1133
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:55,679
Once you are in NDU,

1134
00:56:56,399 --> 00:56:57,879
you jolly well learn to play by our rules.

1135
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,319
Since you guys want to show me

1136
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:02,079
that you don't know how to change your ways.

1137
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:05,039
Tonight we will do something

1138
00:57:05,439 --> 00:57:08,159
to get every single one of you
dirtbags accustomed to changing.

1139
00:57:08,879 --> 00:57:11,759
On your feet. On your back.

1140
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:14,759
Change to your No. 4 now.

1141
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:22,079
You guys have 5 mins to change
into your wet suit.

1142
00:57:22,399 --> 00:57:23,399
Change to wet suit.

1143
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:28,079
On your back.

1144
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,799
1, 2...

1145
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:33,759
Is this the standard
you are going to show me?

1146
00:57:33,879 --> 00:57:34,639
No, sir.

1147
00:57:34,759 --> 00:57:36,399
-What do you want to be?
-Diver, sir.

1148
00:57:36,919 --> 00:57:38,559
Change to your No. 4 now.

1149
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:40,039
Flutter kick position, ready.

1150
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:41,399
1, 2, 3...

1151
00:57:42,479 --> 00:57:45,199
Hold it there.

1152
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:49,919
I said hold it there.

1153
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:52,359
Jumping jack position, ready.

1154
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:57,639
1, 2, 3...

1155
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:05,599
Change to wet suit.

1156
00:58:34,479 --> 00:58:35,839
Unlike army training.

1157
00:58:35,959 --> 00:58:39,599
Our training is basically done
under the five S condition.

1158
00:58:39,919 --> 00:58:40,719
Sun.

1159
00:58:40,879 --> 00:58:41,639
Sea.

1160
00:58:41,759 --> 00:58:42,559
Sand.

1161
00:58:42,759 --> 00:58:43,559
Sweat.

1162
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:44,799
And shit.

1163
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:50,719
Wet and sandy. Not taking a swim.

1164
00:58:51,999 --> 00:58:53,879
Boy scouts move faster than you.

1165
00:58:57,519 --> 00:58:59,119
Not just extra PT.

1166
00:58:59,279 --> 00:59:01,199
But they also treat us the infamous

1167
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:02,879
NDU crushed peanut mochi.

1168
00:59:03,399 --> 00:59:05,999
Who the heck named such a sick punishment

1169
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:07,679
over one of my favourite food?

1170
00:59:10,999 --> 00:59:12,159
Ever since Ken found out that

1171
00:59:12,279 --> 00:59:14,719
his girlfriend had dumped him
for a commando.

1172
00:59:14,999 --> 00:59:17,519
He became very frustrated with his training.

1173
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:19,799
And I seriously think that his attitude

1174
00:59:19,919 --> 00:59:22,839
will eventually get him into deep trouble.

1175
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:30,599
I hate tyre PT.

1176
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:33,039
You don't have to like it.
You just have to do it.

1177
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:34,839
Come on. Let's go.

1178
00:59:34,959 --> 00:59:36,319
Up...

1179
00:59:37,479 --> 00:59:39,399
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

1180
00:59:39,639 --> 00:59:40,839
Do you understand?

1181
00:59:41,399 --> 00:59:42,599
Flip it.

1182
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,799
You weak piece of crap.

1183
00:59:43,919 --> 00:59:44,959
What are you doing?

1184
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:46,639
Flip it.

1185
00:59:46,759 --> 00:59:48,439
What's with that pathetic face of yours?

1186
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:49,399
What are you doing?

1187
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:51,799
Flip it. You weak piece of crap.

1188
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,919
With that big body of yours,
what can you do?

1189
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:56,879
Shut up. I have had enough of your shit.

1190
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:58,679
What's the point of this useless training?

1191
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:00,199
You can't win a war by flipping tyres.

1192
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:01,319
-Really?
-This is pointless.

1193
01:00:01,439 --> 01:00:03,239
I am already pulling out,
giving my 100 percent.

1194
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:04,439
And you still want to give me shit.

1195
01:00:04,879 --> 01:00:06,159
I am better than all you instructors.

1196
01:00:06,279 --> 01:00:07,239
You guys are from NATO.

1197
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:08,279
No action, talk only.

1198
01:00:08,399 --> 01:00:09,599
Ken Chow, lock it up.

1199
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:13,079
What's all these commotion about?

1200
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:16,639
Ken Chow here says he can out perform
all of us instructors.

1201
01:00:18,479 --> 01:00:20,399
I am impressed, Ken Chow.

1202
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:22,239
So, are you issuing me a challenge?

1203
01:00:22,479 --> 01:00:23,519
Sir, I am just telling the truth.

1204
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:24,399
The truth?

1205
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:26,679
The truth is going to hurt you really bad.

1206
01:00:26,999 --> 01:00:27,799
You know what?

1207
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:30,239
Since all of us are so incapable...

1208
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:33,239
He is younger and fitter than I am.

1209
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:35,319
Tell you what, why don't you challenge me?

1210
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:36,439
To a tyre race.

1211
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:38,039
I will give you a 20 metre head start.

1212
01:00:39,479 --> 01:00:41,319
Parade Square. Five minutes.

1213
01:00:41,439 --> 01:00:42,439
No, sir.

1214
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,839
Sure, sir. Let's go.

1215
01:00:44,399 --> 01:00:47,079
3, 2, 1.

1216
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:48,079
Go.

1217
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:21,599
Go, Ken...

1218
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:23,319
Hurry up.

1219
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:27,119
Ken, go.

1220
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:31,759
Watch out.

1221
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:47,039
Move back.

1222
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:48,319
Leave him alone.

1223
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:50,519
Don't touch him.

1224
01:01:51,439 --> 01:01:52,239
Move back.

1225
01:01:57,399 --> 01:01:58,519
You wanted to challenge me, right?

1226
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,119
Let me tell you.

1227
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:02,119
You're the worst challenge
I've ever had in my life.

1228
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:05,599
Stand at attention when I am talking to you.

1229
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:07,039
Stand up.

1230
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:08,359
Yes, sir.

1231
01:02:10,839 --> 01:02:12,119
This is the top one percent.

1232
01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:16,199
You are not even worth to be here.

1233
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:19,319
From day one when you step
through the gates of NDU,

1234
01:02:19,439 --> 01:02:20,439
I have been watching you.

1235
01:02:21,719 --> 01:02:22,879
Making calls.

1236
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:23,999
Texting.

1237
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:25,719
You think I didn't see all these.

1238
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:27,719
Every other training.

1239
01:02:28,359 --> 01:02:29,479
You were skiving,

1240
01:02:29,759 --> 01:02:31,119
finding excuses.

1241
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:32,679
You think I don't know all these.

1242
01:02:33,079 --> 01:02:33,839
Ken Chow.

1243
01:02:34,479 --> 01:02:36,679
You reported sick twelve times.

1244
01:02:36,959 --> 01:02:38,679
DIY sore eyes.

1245
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,439
Decompression sickness.

1246
01:02:40,759 --> 01:02:41,959
From head to toe.

1247
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:44,799
You had every other bloody problems.

1248
01:02:46,279 --> 01:02:47,119
Do you think this is

1249
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:48,279
a summer camp?

1250
01:02:48,679 --> 01:02:51,599
I will not take your shit
and your stinking attitude.

1251
01:02:51,799 --> 01:02:53,239
NDU is only for the elite.

1252
01:02:53,719 --> 01:02:55,319
It's your wish to get out of course.

1253
01:02:55,479 --> 01:02:57,719
Join the Air Force and be a pilot.

1254
01:02:58,959 --> 01:02:59,759
You know what?

1255
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:02,159
I will personally write your appraisal

1256
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:04,559
and the Air Force will hear about
your shitty attitude.

1257
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:05,639
You want to fly?

1258
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:07,639
You can only fly a kite.

1259
01:03:09,439 --> 01:03:10,679
You don't deserve to be here.

1260
01:03:11,399 --> 01:03:12,719
You want to get out of course.

1261
01:03:13,279 --> 01:03:15,559
No need for you to think
so hard from now on.

1262
01:03:16,399 --> 01:03:17,199
Ken Chow.

1263
01:03:17,399 --> 01:03:18,159
You

1264
01:03:18,279 --> 01:03:19,079
are.

1265
01:03:19,239 --> 01:03:20,039
out.

1266
01:03:29,479 --> 01:03:31,119
Ken, lucky you.

1267
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:33,239
Finally you are no longer a frogman.

1268
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:34,599
You are a free man, bro.

1269
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:36,479
Congrats.

1270
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:37,639
You are finally out of hell.

1271
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:39,959
It's right that you go.

1272
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:41,519
The only thing you know

1273
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:42,559
is to act sick.

1274
01:03:42,759 --> 01:03:44,479
As if the world owes you a living.

1275
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:45,359
Your departure

1276
01:03:45,479 --> 01:03:47,159
is really a win-win for everyone.

1277
01:03:47,479 --> 01:03:48,319
Good job.

1278
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:49,519
Thanks.

1279
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:51,359
Since you like to act sick so often,

1280
01:03:51,479 --> 01:03:53,879
the instructors will definitely
tell the Air Force.

1281
01:03:53,999 --> 01:03:56,519
The Air Force may not approve
your transfer at all.

1282
01:03:56,639 --> 01:03:57,759
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

1283
01:03:58,119 --> 01:04:00,679
Land, Air and Sea.
They all share the same database.

1284
01:04:01,919 --> 01:04:03,239
Wait, how do you know?

1285
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:04,559
I read it in my book.

1286
01:04:05,399 --> 01:04:06,959
Whatever. It doesn't matter.

1287
01:04:07,399 --> 01:04:08,519
When I go to the Air Force,

1288
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:09,919
it will be a brand new start.

1289
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:11,479
New man. New attitude.

1290
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,079
New me. Trust me.

1291
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:15,879
Ken, let me analyse it for you.

1292
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,279
It may feel good to be out of course.

1293
01:04:18,399 --> 01:04:19,279
But have you given it a thought?

1294
01:04:19,399 --> 01:04:20,799
If your girlfriend
and her current boyfriend find out

1295
01:04:20,919 --> 01:04:21,959
that you are being kicked out,

1296
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,159
they will probably laugh at you.

1297
01:04:23,279 --> 01:04:24,039
Why so?

1298
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:25,439
Because you prove them right.

1299
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:26,919
You are childish and immature.

1300
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:27,879
That's why you are out.

1301
01:04:27,999 --> 01:04:28,799
I am serious.

1302
01:04:28,919 --> 01:04:30,119
And this great story of yours

1303
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:33,119
will be told by that baldy
until the day he retires.

1304
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,399
Your name in NDU

1305
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:37,279
will definitely be more famous
than that frog in Parade Square.

1306
01:04:37,399 --> 01:04:38,319
I am not kidding you.

1307
01:04:38,439 --> 01:04:39,959
Yeah, think about it.

1308
01:04:40,399 --> 01:04:41,719
If I were your girlfriend,

1309
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,519
-I would dump you too.
-Why?

1310
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:44,559
Because you suck

1311
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:45,559
and have no backbone.

1312
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:47,759
That's why she looks for a commando

1313
01:04:47,879 --> 01:04:49,079
and made you a cuckold.

1314
01:04:49,479 --> 01:04:52,039
Chill it, bro.

1315
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:53,879
What I am saying is the truth.
And the truth hurts.

1316
01:04:53,999 --> 01:04:55,599
Yes, the truth hurts.

1317
01:04:55,719 --> 01:04:57,039
Life is harsh.

1318
01:04:58,359 --> 01:05:00,599
So what do you want me to do?

1319
01:05:00,879 --> 01:05:02,439
I have already screwed it up so much.

1320
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:03,719
There is no going back for me.

1321
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:05,359
Completing the CDC is the only way

1322
01:05:05,479 --> 01:05:06,399
to save your girlfriend

1323
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:07,919
and save your face.

1324
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,199
Yeah, faster apologise to No. 2

1325
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:11,679
and beg him to let you stay in the course

1326
01:05:11,799 --> 01:05:13,359
and better make sure you complete it.

1327
01:05:19,799 --> 01:05:20,799
This is the first time he talks sense.

1328
01:05:20,919 --> 01:05:21,719
You better listen.

1329
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,919
No. 2.

1330
01:05:23,479 --> 01:05:24,479
There is no way in hell

1331
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:26,519
I am going to apologise to that baldy.

1332
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:29,119
We divers are not like that.

1333
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:30,439
If I were you.

1334
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,239
I would definitely complete my CDC.

1335
01:05:32,359 --> 01:05:33,799
And during my graduation,

1336
01:05:33,919 --> 01:05:35,279
I will magnanimously invite both of them

1337
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:36,799
to attend my ceremony

1338
01:05:36,998 --> 01:05:38,039
to see how I shine.

1339
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:39,398
It will be like slapping them
on their faces.

1340
01:05:39,559 --> 01:05:41,438
Then you get posted to Air Force
and become a pilot.

1341
01:05:41,558 --> 01:05:42,719
That will be another slap.

1342
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:44,479
One on the left, another on the right.

1343
01:05:44,599 --> 01:05:45,959
Smack her prim and proper.

1344
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,359
Besides, you can prove that baldy wrong.

1345
01:05:48,479 --> 01:05:49,358
Make him drop hair in anger.

1346
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:51,278
Shed his eyebrows too.

1347
01:05:52,238 --> 01:05:53,039
Well said.

1348
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:56,719
Actually this is exactly what I want to say.

1349
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:58,039
Shameless.

1350
01:05:59,078 --> 01:06:00,439
You are just taking others' words.

1351
01:06:00,638 --> 01:06:02,239
I am really going to stick you on the wall.

1352
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,399
Go sleep.

1353
01:06:08,399 --> 01:06:10,358
Go sleep.

1354
01:06:11,959 --> 01:06:13,079
Lights off.

1355
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:20,239
Excuse me, sir.

1356
01:06:22,118 --> 01:06:22,999
Yes?

1357
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:25,478
Sir.

1358
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,959
Can you help me?

1359
01:06:27,799 --> 01:06:30,638
Why are you wasting your time
on this kind of scumbag?

1360
01:06:30,998 --> 01:06:32,198
He is really a dirtbag.

1361
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,199
His stinking attitude will only
bring the entire 48 down.

1362
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:38,999
Sir, I am vouching for him because

1363
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:40,319
when he came to see me,

1364
01:06:40,478 --> 01:06:41,678
he seems very sincere about changing.

1365
01:06:42,439 --> 01:06:43,238
Alex.

1366
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:44,599
If he screws up this time,

1367
01:06:44,798 --> 01:06:46,079
I will take full responsibility.

1368
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:47,078
Alex,

1369
01:06:47,198 --> 01:06:48,038
this time,

1370
01:06:48,278 --> 01:06:49,118
last time,

1371
01:06:49,279 --> 01:06:50,078
next time...

1372
01:06:50,359 --> 01:06:52,519
A leopard will never change its spots.

1373
01:06:52,718 --> 01:06:54,199
And his bloody stinking attitude,

1374
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:56,879
his negative attitude towards training
and everything else

1375
01:06:57,159 --> 01:06:58,999
will only bring the entire school down

1376
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,639
and it's a disgrace to NDU.

1377
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:01,839
Seriously,

1378
01:07:01,959 --> 01:07:03,959
I gave him the opportunity
to get out of my course.

1379
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:05,399
He jolly well get the hell out.

1380
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:06,639
Sir.

1381
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:07,959
What are you doing here?

1382
01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:09,399
Please hear me out.

1383
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:11,319
I know I used to make excuses

1384
01:07:11,919 --> 01:07:13,239
and had a messed up attitude.

1385
01:07:13,759 --> 01:07:15,119
I was childish and immature.

1386
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:17,439
But I have realised my mistakes.

1387
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:18,679
I want to change.

1388
01:07:18,879 --> 01:07:20,279
All I need is one chance.

1389
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,639
Ken Chow, your one chance came.

1390
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,079
It's for you to get out of my course.

1391
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,039
With your stinking attitude

1392
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:28,279
and your negativity

1393
01:07:28,399 --> 01:07:31,159
you'll only bring the whole
entire 48 batch down.

1394
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:32,719
If I let you stay here,

1395
01:07:32,839 --> 01:07:34,399
you will be a disgrace to NDU.

1396
01:07:34,839 --> 01:07:36,439
Sir. Yes, I admit.

1397
01:07:36,879 --> 01:07:37,839
I used to make excuses.

1398
01:07:37,999 --> 01:07:39,119
But I'm actually very fit

1399
01:07:39,759 --> 01:07:40,839
and I will prove it to you.

1400
01:07:41,079 --> 01:07:43,399
I will run 20 rounds
around the Parade Square.

1401
01:07:44,759 --> 01:07:45,559
30.

1402
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:47,479
50.

1403
01:07:47,639 --> 01:07:48,759
I'll run 50 rounds right now.

1404
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,359
Round 5.

1405
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:07,719
Round 15.

1406
01:08:19,959 --> 01:08:21,959
Round 30.

1407
01:08:26,879 --> 01:08:28,799
If he completes 50 rounds,
he has a chance to stay.

1408
01:08:29,319 --> 01:08:30,719
At least he is fighting for it now.

1409
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:32,439
He is doing the right thing.

1410
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:34,039
Hooyah.

1411
01:08:34,599 --> 01:08:35,359
Hooyah.

1412
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:36,319
Hooyah.

1413
01:08:49,479 --> 01:08:51,079
Hey guys. It's raining.

1414
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:52,919
This is only round 33.

1415
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:55,119
I'm sure he can't complete 50 rounds.

1416
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:57,199
Definitely out of course.

1417
01:09:11,239 --> 01:09:12,079
Ken.

1418
01:09:12,759 --> 01:09:13,559
Sir.

1419
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:15,199
You can stop. It is raining.

1420
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:16,359
Is it category one?

1421
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:17,279
No.

1422
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:19,879
Sir, I shouldn't be afraid of
a little water.

1423
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:21,919
Please let me finish it.

1424
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:24,959
Okay. Let's do it together.

1425
01:09:33,879 --> 01:09:35,159
Come on guys, don't be shy.

1426
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,719
It's time to show some team spirit.

1427
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:37,639
Hooyah.

1428
01:09:40,599 --> 01:09:41,399
Guys, what happened?

1429
01:09:41,519 --> 01:09:42,479
We are 48.

1430
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:44,159
We are the same batch. We are the same boat.

1431
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:46,879
If Ken can do it, so can we. Yes, we can.

1432
01:09:46,999 --> 01:09:47,879
Eat shit.

1433
01:09:49,999 --> 01:09:50,759
Never mind.

1434
01:09:50,879 --> 01:09:51,759
We cannot.

1435
01:09:53,719 --> 01:09:55,279
Round 48.

1436
01:09:59,639 --> 01:10:01,079
Round 49.

1437
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:06,159
Round 50.

1438
01:10:38,199 --> 01:10:43,159
Who else but we? Somebody tell me.

1439
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:44,559
Who else but we?

1440
01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:48,199
Goin' step up to the plate for my city SG?
Naval divers.

1441
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,879
We fight on through the plight.
All day.

1442
01:10:50,999 --> 01:10:53,399
To righteously earn the right. Everyday.

1443
01:10:53,519 --> 01:10:54,799
To call ourselves

1444
01:10:54,919 --> 01:10:57,879
masters of the deep, naval diver pride.
Hooyah!

1445
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:00,799
We dem boys from the Navy.

1446
01:11:00,919 --> 01:11:02,119
Better known as frogmen.

1447
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,559
We be training all day,
rolling wet in the sand.

1448
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:07,759
There's a reason we're the baddest
from the Sea, Air, Land.

1449
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:09,599
Nothing stands in our way.

1450
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:12,199
Cos to us the only easy day was yesterday.

1451
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:14,679
With my brothers at the grinder,
gettin' hammered all day.

1452
01:11:14,799 --> 01:11:16,679
Build a body harder
than a rock for the ladies.

1453
01:11:16,799 --> 01:11:17,559
48.

1454
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:18,679
Wake up your idea.

1455
01:11:18,799 --> 01:11:19,719
Watch where you are swimming.

1456
01:11:19,839 --> 01:11:20,999
Keep to this side.

1457
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:22,199
You want to keep swimming to your right.

1458
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:24,079
Want to go Sembawang park
to book out, is it?

1459
01:11:24,759 --> 01:11:27,319
But how can I leave my brothers
to suffer themselves?

1460
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:30,159
We were taught to live by that hit.

1461
01:11:30,279 --> 01:11:32,559
Honour. Team spirit. Integrity.

1462
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:34,719
The more we get together,
the stronger we be.

1463
01:11:34,839 --> 01:11:36,159
Cos we're the best of the best.

1464
01:11:36,279 --> 01:11:37,319
Well done, Ken Chow.

1465
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:38,319
That's the way.

1466
01:11:38,439 --> 01:11:39,279
Stick with the programme.

1467
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:40,319
You can do it. Come on.

1468
01:11:41,559 --> 01:11:44,079
Alex, it's only day one of his redemption.

1469
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,119
It's a long journey.

1470
01:11:45,559 --> 01:11:46,519
Don't worry, sir.

1471
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:47,639
I believe he can do it.

1472
01:11:47,919 --> 01:11:48,839
He is my man.

1473
01:11:48,959 --> 01:11:51,399
We fight on through the plight. All day.

1474
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:53,879
To righteously earn the right. Everyday.

1475
01:11:53,999 --> 01:11:55,359
To call ourselves,

1476
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:58,479
masters of the deep, naval diver pride.
Hooyah!

1477
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:06,159
Hey mom.

1478
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:09,359
Everything is okay. Trust me.

1479
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:12,639
I will talk to you tomorrow.

1480
01:12:13,799 --> 01:12:14,799
I know.

1481
01:12:15,079 --> 01:12:15,919
Love you.

1482
01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:16,959
Good night.

1483
01:12:19,879 --> 01:12:20,799
Bro.

1484
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:21,879
Can you lend me a screwdriver?

1485
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:25,199
How much?

1486
01:12:25,319 --> 01:12:26,479
It's free.

1487
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:27,759
Thanks.

1488
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:31,479
Hey Lobang. Anything to share?

1489
01:12:31,599 --> 01:12:32,919
What's all these for?

1490
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,439
Drill a few holes in your boots
to let the water out.

1491
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:36,679
Hell week is five long days.

1492
01:12:36,799 --> 01:12:37,759
Our feet will be soaked.

1493
01:12:37,879 --> 01:12:38,799
It will definitely rot.

1494
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:40,599
So bad. Spouting vulgarity.

1495
01:12:40,799 --> 01:12:42,839
Don't think we don't understand.

1496
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:45,199
Gentlemen.

1497
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:47,959
As you all know, I am not a vulgar person.

1498
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:49,279
But for this word,

1499
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:52,079
I can vouch that it is not a vulgarity.

1500
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:56,159
He is talking about foot rot
and it is not a vulgarity.

1501
01:12:56,279 --> 01:12:57,319
Just like my name.

1502
01:12:57,479 --> 01:12:59,959
Jin Seah-lan, it is not a vulgarity.

1503
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,319
So please don't be offended by his foot rot

1504
01:13:02,439 --> 01:13:04,559
and please take foot rot seriously.

1505
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,119
What the foot rot are you talking about?

1506
01:13:07,239 --> 01:13:09,119
You are making it worse.

1507
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:10,959
-Go sit down.
-Back.

1508
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,599
Come.

1509
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:14,879
5 dollars each.

1510
01:13:14,999 --> 01:13:15,959
Lifetime guarantee.

1511
01:13:16,279 --> 01:13:17,199
Remember to pay up.

1512
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:21,119
Lobang, why does everyone have a screw?

1513
01:13:21,239 --> 01:13:22,399
Can you give me a screw?

1514
01:13:23,759 --> 01:13:25,519
Screwdriver.

1515
01:13:25,799 --> 01:13:26,639
You know how to screw?

1516
01:13:26,759 --> 01:13:29,279
Don't worry. I am an expert in screwing.

1517
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:30,319
Go screw yourself.

1518
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:31,479
-Thank you.
-Handsome.

1519
01:13:31,599 --> 01:13:32,399
Yes.

1520
01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:36,119
Lobang, you really understand me.

1521
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:38,079
I didn't have time to buy this.

1522
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:40,199
I know. We can't shower for five days
during Hell week.

1523
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:41,719
At least you can wash your face with this.

1524
01:13:41,839 --> 01:13:43,519
3-in-1 mud foam plus serum.

1525
01:13:43,639 --> 01:13:45,039
You will be more handsome.

1526
01:13:45,599 --> 01:13:46,879
Thank you for your concern.

1527
01:13:46,999 --> 01:13:48,319
Thank you for your contribution.

1528
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:49,719
-Remember to pay.
-Okay.

1529
01:13:49,839 --> 01:13:51,359
Don't be crazy.

1530
01:13:51,479 --> 01:13:52,519
How are you going to
bring this to Hell week?

1531
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:54,919
We will all be punished if you are caught.

1532
01:13:55,719 --> 01:13:57,559
Don't underestimate me.

1533
01:14:01,519 --> 01:14:04,439
Our instructors always have
lots of creative ideas

1534
01:14:04,559 --> 01:14:06,239
for us to play with our boats.

1535
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:08,319
Double boats carry.

1536
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:13,359
Triple boats carry.

1537
01:14:13,719 --> 01:14:15,679
Double strenuous and triple hard.

1538
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:19,119
Now training is getting more
and more grueling each day.

1539
01:14:19,239 --> 01:14:22,919
We're all trying very hard to adapt to it.

1540
01:14:28,599 --> 01:14:29,799
As for Hei-long and me,

1541
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,319
we still can't adapt to each other.

1542
01:14:33,639 --> 01:14:35,319
Boat 2 chain push-up.

1543
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:42,919
Sorry.

1544
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:44,199
Are you trying to be funny?

1545
01:14:46,839 --> 01:14:47,639
What's your problem?

1546
01:14:47,759 --> 01:14:48,599
He kicked me in the face.

1547
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:49,559
Do I look like I give a shit?

1548
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:50,519
Get into position.

1549
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:52,079
Sorry.

1550
01:14:54,759 --> 01:14:57,199
Boat 2, I just need you guys
to give me one good push-up.

1551
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,759
Carry on.

1552
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:14,959
You bloody idiot.

1553
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:16,199
Did I kill your family
in your previous life?

1554
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:17,679
Why are you always stepping on my toes?

1555
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:18,999
Translate?

1556
01:15:19,239 --> 01:15:20,559
For Hokkien, I can.

1557
01:15:20,759 --> 01:15:22,359
For Cantonese, I am trash.

1558
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:23,679
Come on, it's obviously an accident.

1559
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:24,559
Just give him a break.

1560
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:25,599
Yes, Hei-long, I am sorry.

1561
01:15:25,719 --> 01:15:26,959
It's all an accident.

1562
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:28,119
My friend.

1563
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:29,279
It was just a nudge.

1564
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:30,559
Are you a girl?

1565
01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:32,479
Look at him. He was just giddy

1566
01:15:32,599 --> 01:15:34,199
so he accidentally hit you.

1567
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:35,359
Look at his timid face.

1568
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:36,279
He wouldn't dare to mess with you.

1569
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:37,559
Don't make me laugh.

1570
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:38,519
Can't you see?

1571
01:15:38,679 --> 01:15:39,959
Even my little bro is laughing at you.

1572
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:40,839
Stop your bullshit

1573
01:15:40,959 --> 01:15:41,879
or I will stick you to the wall.

1574
01:15:41,999 --> 01:15:43,239
Come if you dare.

1575
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:46,399
I am sorry. It's all my fault.

1576
01:15:46,519 --> 01:15:47,999
Please do not fight.

1577
01:15:48,119 --> 01:15:50,079
We are batch mates and even cabin mates.

1578
01:15:50,199 --> 01:15:51,639
Not war. Make love.

1579
01:15:51,799 --> 01:15:52,879
I can't stand you anymore.

1580
01:15:52,999 --> 01:15:54,319
I am going to stick you on the wall tonight.

1581
01:15:54,799 --> 01:15:55,639
Stick to the wall.

1582
01:16:00,999 --> 01:16:01,879
Don't stop them.

1583
01:16:15,919 --> 01:16:16,679
Stick to the wall.

1584
01:16:16,799 --> 01:16:17,799
Now he got himself onto the wall.

1585
01:16:17,919 --> 01:16:19,639
So this is called sticking to the wall.

1586
01:16:50,959 --> 01:16:52,639
I had enough of you.

1587
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,519
Bloody hell.

1588
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:58,919
From the first day you came,
you think you are the boss.

1589
01:16:59,639 --> 01:17:00,799
Everybody should suck up to you.

1590
01:17:00,919 --> 01:17:02,319
Everybody should be bullied by you.

1591
01:17:02,519 --> 01:17:03,839
You think just because you have a tattoo

1592
01:17:03,959 --> 01:17:05,719
everyone should be afraid of you.

1593
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:07,879
You know what is the medical term
for your condition?

1594
01:17:08,879 --> 01:17:10,639
ADABHD.

1595
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:14,199
Asshole don't know anything but only
know how to bully and arrogant disorder.

1596
01:17:14,599 --> 01:17:16,559
We kept quiet not because
we are weaker than you

1597
01:17:16,879 --> 01:17:18,639
but because we have better EQ than you.

1598
01:17:18,959 --> 01:17:19,759
Idiot.

1599
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,919
Let me tell you something.

1600
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:22,519
I grew up learning martial arts.

1601
01:17:22,959 --> 01:17:24,199
Boxing. Judo. Muay Thai.

1602
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:25,719
and Chinese kung fu.

1603
01:17:25,839 --> 01:17:27,319
MMA, Jeet Kune Do.

1604
01:17:28,919 --> 01:17:30,799
I am good at everything

1605
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:33,439
but why was I willing to be bullied by you?

1606
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:35,519
Because I pity you.

1607
01:17:36,599 --> 01:17:37,679
One pathetic loser

1608
01:17:37,799 --> 01:17:39,879
with no love and no real friends.

1609
01:17:40,119 --> 01:17:41,399
You've got no love from your mommy.

1610
01:17:41,599 --> 01:17:42,879
You've got no love from your daddy.

1611
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:45,159
I think you only got love
from your gang of scums.

1612
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:47,119
You only know how to shout
and throw your temper

1613
01:17:47,239 --> 01:17:49,359
just to cover up your feeling
of inferiority.

1614
01:17:49,959 --> 01:17:51,999
You are one pathetic bastard.

1615
01:17:55,359 --> 01:17:56,719
Aren't you very good at talking back?

1616
01:17:58,319 --> 01:17:59,559
If I am wrong, tell me.

1617
01:17:59,879 --> 01:18:01,519
Hit me here. Hit me if you want.

1618
01:18:12,919 --> 01:18:13,799
Sorry guys.

1619
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:15,799
I am not a violent person.

1620
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:21,319
I'm actually a very kind
and easy going person.

1621
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:24,199
My mother gave birth to me

1622
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:26,479
not to be bullied by you.

1623
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:04,599
Don't blame me for talking too much.

1624
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,639
Our training is hard enough.

1625
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:08,399
Don't fight over little things like this.

1626
01:19:08,879 --> 01:19:11,759
It's endless.

1627
01:19:15,519 --> 01:19:17,839
I saw you quarrelling with your parents
when we were enlisting.

1628
01:19:18,959 --> 01:19:19,919
Believe me.

1629
01:19:20,039 --> 01:19:21,519
We all have family problems.

1630
01:19:22,119 --> 01:19:24,639
Yours is no big deal.

1631
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,679
Let it go. We are all brothers.

1632
01:19:29,079 --> 01:19:30,599
I will treat you to supper.

1633
01:19:32,879 --> 01:19:34,039
Where was it delivered the last time?

1634
01:19:34,199 --> 01:19:34,999
Side gate.

1635
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:36,079
Between the two trees.

1636
01:19:36,999 --> 01:19:38,519
Be careful. That is my secret passage.

1637
01:19:38,639 --> 01:19:39,439
Don't let things go wrong.

1638
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:42,399
You are calling for delivery?

1639
01:19:42,639 --> 01:19:43,599
It's very dangerous.

1640
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:45,439
No guts? Then don't eat.

1641
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:46,959
I want to eat.

1642
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:48,679
I want it, too.

1643
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:50,999
Engaged.

1644
01:19:53,239 --> 01:19:54,119
Call Panther.

1645
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:55,919
Ask him to buy.

1646
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:02,999
Boss, I am here.

1647
01:20:03,519 --> 01:20:04,439
Where are you?

1648
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:09,239
No one's here.

1649
01:20:09,919 --> 01:20:10,719
I see him.

1650
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:22,239
Can I help you?

1651
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:26,319
Are you from batch 48?

1652
01:20:27,839 --> 01:20:28,639
Yes.

1653
01:20:28,879 --> 01:20:29,679
Why?

1654
01:20:30,119 --> 01:20:31,199
Your order is here.

1655
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:32,279
Bread Talk?

1656
01:20:32,679 --> 01:20:33,719
Toast Box?

1657
01:20:35,959 --> 01:20:36,799
Over here.

1658
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:47,759
Don't tell me you are an

1659
01:20:47,879 --> 01:20:48,999
instructor?

1660
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:50,879
There are no bald instructors.

1661
01:20:50,999 --> 01:20:52,599
Only men are shaved.

1662
01:20:56,559 --> 01:20:57,519
You are right.

1663
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:00,599
But you look

1664
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:01,759
kind of old.

1665
01:21:01,879 --> 01:21:02,719
To tell you the truth.

1666
01:21:02,839 --> 01:21:05,039
I am actually nineteen.

1667
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:06,839
Nineteen?

1668
01:21:08,879 --> 01:21:09,839
Okay.

1669
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:13,199
Who asked you to buy these?

1670
01:21:13,319 --> 01:21:14,159
These...

1671
01:21:15,959 --> 01:21:18,039
You are trying to test me.

1672
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:20,519
How can I tell you?

1673
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:22,559
It's the one who asked you here, of course.

1674
01:21:23,239 --> 01:21:24,319
Don't think I am a fool?

1675
01:21:24,439 --> 01:21:25,479
I am also NDU.

1676
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:26,919
You are NDU?

1677
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:29,599
Night Delivery Unit.

1678
01:21:31,479 --> 01:21:32,679
Okay.

1679
01:21:36,919 --> 01:21:38,759
Are you sure you are not an instructor?

1680
01:21:38,879 --> 01:21:40,159
Just believe me. Hurry.

1681
01:21:40,519 --> 01:21:43,199
Hurry.

1682
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:47,159
You really look damn old.

1683
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:51,119
Thank you.

1684
01:21:51,759 --> 01:21:53,159
Be careful.

1685
01:21:54,559 --> 01:21:56,239
Be careful, don't let any instructors
spot you.

1686
01:21:56,559 --> 01:21:57,519
You too.

1687
01:21:57,639 --> 01:21:59,599
Look out for cars when you cross the road.

1688
01:22:03,159 --> 01:22:03,999
Bread Talk.

1689
01:22:04,199 --> 01:22:05,039
Toast Box.

1690
01:22:11,279 --> 01:22:12,479
Damn.

1691
01:22:12,599 --> 01:22:13,679
Panther is really dumb.

1692
01:22:13,799 --> 01:22:15,279
He handed our supper to No. 2.

1693
01:22:15,399 --> 01:22:16,599
He is coming up now. What do we do?

1694
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:18,039
What?

1695
01:22:20,359 --> 01:22:21,519
Tell everyone to turn their lights off

1696
01:22:21,639 --> 01:22:22,439
and pretend to sleep.

1697
01:22:22,559 --> 01:22:23,599
Lights off.

1698
01:22:40,839 --> 01:22:41,959
Sleeping so early.

1699
01:22:42,839 --> 01:22:43,919
The delivery is here.

1700
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:44,879
Muster now.

1701
01:22:47,999 --> 01:22:49,279
We are dead this time.

1702
01:22:53,759 --> 01:22:55,279
Coffee, tea or me?

1703
01:22:56,439 --> 01:22:58,399
Divers, why are you sleeping so early?

1704
01:22:58,559 --> 01:22:59,559
Here's your delivery.

1705
01:22:59,919 --> 01:23:00,839
Muster now.

1706
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:08,199
Shit.

1707
01:23:12,119 --> 01:23:13,359
Come.

1708
01:23:13,879 --> 01:23:14,879
Don't be afraid.

1709
01:23:15,879 --> 01:23:16,879
We are divers.

1710
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:18,799
Home of the brave and courageous.

1711
01:23:18,919 --> 01:23:20,039
Don't be scared, come.

1712
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:22,919
I am very sorry gentlemen.

1713
01:23:23,119 --> 01:23:24,959
I have to wake you up
in the middle of the night.

1714
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:27,159
Deprive you of 8 hours of sleep,

1715
01:23:27,639 --> 01:23:29,399
knowing tomorrow will be
a very strenuous day.

1716
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:31,679
I am very sorry that the Navy cannot cook

1717
01:23:31,799 --> 01:23:33,239
to your taste buds' liking.

1718
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:36,159
Until you have to engage in
this kind of high risk operation

1719
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:37,879
to ask outside NDU

1720
01:23:37,999 --> 01:23:39,759
to deliver to our NDU.

1721
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:42,759
You don't know what is outside NDU?

1722
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:46,319
Night Delivery Unit.

1723
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:47,839
You go through so much trouble

1724
01:23:47,959 --> 01:23:49,119
might as well eat, am I right?

1725
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:51,079
Don't waste everybody's effort.

1726
01:23:51,519 --> 01:23:52,479
Eat.

1727
01:23:53,639 --> 01:23:54,559
Don't understand?

1728
01:23:55,119 --> 01:23:56,359
Eat!

1729
01:23:56,559 --> 01:23:57,439
Eat.

1730
01:23:57,999 --> 01:23:59,039
Still don't understand?

1731
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:01,119
Eat, bro.

1732
01:24:01,319 --> 01:24:03,359
Eat. Don't you understand?

1733
01:24:03,599 --> 01:24:05,679
Good boys, eat the food.

1734
01:24:05,799 --> 01:24:07,359
The bread is very nice.

1735
01:24:08,039 --> 01:24:08,799
Let's eat.

1736
01:24:08,919 --> 01:24:09,919
Still don't understand?

1737
01:24:10,039 --> 01:24:10,879
Cannot be.

1738
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:14,879
Bread Talk. Toast Box. Very nice.

1739
01:24:15,079 --> 01:24:17,039
You're happy, I'm happy, tummy happy.

1740
01:24:17,159 --> 01:24:18,839
Everybody happy.

1741
01:24:19,399 --> 01:24:20,439
Eat.

1742
01:24:20,559 --> 01:24:21,359
Take.

1743
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:26,959
Why?

1744
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:27,879
Jaws locked?

1745
01:24:28,119 --> 01:24:28,919
Brains hang?

1746
01:24:29,599 --> 01:24:30,479
Eat.

1747
01:24:30,679 --> 01:24:32,719
Enjoy it. Eat.

1748
01:24:32,839 --> 01:24:34,359
Gentlemen, it's okay. Come on, eat.

1749
01:24:35,319 --> 01:24:37,519
I give you permission to eat. Eat.

1750
01:24:52,839 --> 01:24:54,599
Just because of your stupid stomachs,

1751
01:24:54,799 --> 01:24:57,519
you want to break the system of rules
and regulations we have here.

1752
01:24:58,519 --> 01:25:01,279
Getting outside food in here to be consumed.

1753
01:25:06,919 --> 01:25:10,119
I promise you, 48, every single one of you.

1754
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:11,639
I am going to hammer you

1755
01:25:11,759 --> 01:25:15,919
until someone stands up
to admit he is the culprit.

1756
01:25:17,759 --> 01:25:19,439
Okay, boys. Awesome.

1757
01:25:19,759 --> 01:25:20,919
None of you want to own up right?

1758
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:22,799
8 counts of bodybuilder.

1759
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:25,079
48, good job. Well done.

1760
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:26,319
After an hour

1761
01:25:26,439 --> 01:25:28,239
you are still able to endure all these.

1762
01:25:28,519 --> 01:25:29,479
Good on you.

1763
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:31,799
I am happy that our training has paid off.

1764
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:33,559
Because of your stupidity,

1765
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:35,679
your hunger and your stomachs,

1766
01:25:35,879 --> 01:25:38,199
you are willing to sacrifice
the whole entire batch.

1767
01:25:38,839 --> 01:25:40,359
Selfish bloody individual.

1768
01:25:40,879 --> 01:25:43,279
Gentlemen, you better wake up your idea.

1769
01:25:43,399 --> 01:25:44,959
and whoever this coward is,

1770
01:25:45,079 --> 01:25:46,239
you better admit it.

1771
01:25:46,599 --> 01:25:48,279
Show me integrity and be a man.

1772
01:25:51,559 --> 01:25:52,359
Sir.

1773
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:54,479
It's me.

1774
01:25:57,239 --> 01:25:58,039
It's me.

1775
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:01,119
After one hour of hammering,

1776
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:03,039
finally a hero is born.

1777
01:26:03,599 --> 01:26:04,399
Good job.

1778
01:26:06,799 --> 01:26:07,599
Sir.

1779
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:09,199
It was me,

1780
01:26:09,959 --> 01:26:10,759
not Lobang.

1781
01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:13,239
What is this?

1782
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:14,479
Drama series?

1783
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:16,079
Fighting to be heroes?

1784
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:17,159
So touching.

1785
01:26:17,479 --> 01:26:18,719
Any other accomplices?

1786
01:26:19,919 --> 01:26:20,879
No more heroes?

1787
01:26:20,999 --> 01:26:22,679
If not, the whole lot recover.

1788
01:26:22,959 --> 01:26:24,079
Yes, sir.

1789
01:26:31,759 --> 01:26:32,599
Gentlemen,

1790
01:26:34,279 --> 01:26:35,639
for condoning the culprit

1791
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:38,919
you were punished for over an hour.

1792
01:26:40,359 --> 01:26:42,759
But I also see your determination

1793
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:45,239
not to betray your teammates.

1794
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:46,999
And for that

1795
01:26:47,919 --> 01:26:49,039
I am impressed.

1796
01:26:49,719 --> 01:26:52,759
But, here in NDU,

1797
01:26:53,519 --> 01:26:54,799
we have rules to follow.

1798
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:56,999
You

1799
01:26:57,799 --> 01:26:59,599
do not do things your own way here.

1800
01:27:00,879 --> 01:27:02,159
As a Navy diver,

1801
01:27:02,599 --> 01:27:04,599
you should know what is right
and what is wrong.

1802
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:07,279
Yet you went ahead to do it.

1803
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:11,199
This is not part of our core values.

1804
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:15,399
No matter what wrong you've done previously.

1805
01:27:15,559 --> 01:27:16,679
From now on,

1806
01:27:16,799 --> 01:27:19,119
exercise caution in all that you do.

1807
01:27:19,519 --> 01:27:21,279
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir.

1808
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:42,039
We've already passed out from our BMT.

1809
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:43,039
You are still not giving up?

1810
01:27:45,879 --> 01:27:47,479
Bro, you won't understand.

1811
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:49,559
I am not going to give up so easily.

1812
01:27:50,839 --> 01:27:52,279
I underestimated you.

1813
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:53,239
You go, bro.

1814
01:27:53,359 --> 01:27:54,159
You want some?

1815
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:03,679
Lobang, Hei-long.

1816
01:28:04,759 --> 01:28:06,639
Sorry, I suck.

1817
01:28:06,879 --> 01:28:08,319
I should have stood up
and admit it last night.

1818
01:28:08,439 --> 01:28:10,239
You ended up taking the blame for this.

1819
01:28:10,999 --> 01:28:12,479
Actually I really don't feel like
going back.

1820
01:28:12,599 --> 01:28:13,519
Or else, let me stay back too.

1821
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:14,479
Are you crazy?

1822
01:28:14,599 --> 01:28:15,799
We would have taken the blame for nothing.

1823
01:28:15,919 --> 01:28:16,719
Go home.

1824
01:28:16,839 --> 01:28:18,079
Yeah, stop wasting time.

1825
01:28:18,199 --> 01:28:19,759
Just book out and go home.

1826
01:28:19,919 --> 01:28:21,279
It's okay, don't feel bad.

1827
01:28:21,399 --> 01:28:22,319
We are all brothers.

1828
01:28:22,439 --> 01:28:23,639
Next time, my turn.

1829
01:28:24,679 --> 01:28:25,879
Hei-long, Lobang.

1830
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:27,239
Thanks for saving us.

1831
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:28,679
Stop saying all these.

1832
01:28:30,759 --> 01:28:31,599
I have thought about it.

1833
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:33,039
To repay you.

1834
01:28:33,719 --> 01:28:35,519
It is dangerous for your sister
to be alone tonight.

1835
01:28:35,999 --> 01:28:37,599
I will sacrifice myself.
Let me go protect her.

1836
01:28:37,759 --> 01:28:38,999
Don't try to be a good man with me.

1837
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:40,399
It is even more dangerous
to have you there with her.

1838
01:28:40,999 --> 01:28:41,759
Don't worry.

1839
01:28:41,879 --> 01:28:43,439
I will go with him. Confirm safe.

1840
01:28:43,559 --> 01:28:44,879
Don't be a busybody.

1841
01:28:44,999 --> 01:28:45,799
Anyway.

1842
01:28:45,959 --> 01:28:47,719
I am not here to ask for permission.

1843
01:28:47,919 --> 01:28:49,199
I am just informing you.

1844
01:28:49,319 --> 01:28:51,319
Don't ever come back here.

1845
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:53,559
Book out.

1846
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:54,479
Let's go.

1847
01:28:54,959 --> 01:28:56,159
Go, book out.

1848
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:04,719
Hello?

1849
01:29:04,919 --> 01:29:05,959
Radio check?

1850
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:08,319
Handphone check? Over.

1851
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:09,279
Over and out.

1852
01:29:10,119 --> 01:29:11,359
You can't even call out.

1853
01:29:11,599 --> 01:29:12,959
There is not even a connection.

1854
01:29:13,079 --> 01:29:14,279
What is wrong with you?

1855
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:15,479
I have told you many times.

1856
01:29:15,599 --> 01:29:17,039
Before you buy a handphone, ask me.

1857
01:29:17,159 --> 01:29:18,199
Don't act smart.

1858
01:29:18,559 --> 01:29:20,879
Half of the salesmen out there
are just to con you.

1859
01:29:21,759 --> 01:29:22,559
But dear,

1860
01:29:22,679 --> 01:29:24,559
the guy was very convincing.

1861
01:29:24,679 --> 01:29:26,999
He said that there is
the international warranty.

1862
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:28,519
And you believe what he says.

1863
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:30,399
How now?

1864
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:32,879
How?

1865
01:29:32,999 --> 01:29:34,719
Howl. Cry.

1866
01:29:39,399 --> 01:29:40,279
But then,

1867
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:42,599
where is your receipt?

1868
01:29:43,479 --> 01:29:44,319
No receipt.

1869
01:29:44,919 --> 01:29:45,879
No receipt?

1870
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:47,279
How do I help you without a receipt?

1871
01:29:47,399 --> 01:29:49,039
How do I launch a complaint?

1872
01:29:49,639 --> 01:29:50,919
You are really

1873
01:29:51,079 --> 01:29:52,799
more hopeless than my trainees.

1874
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:54,679
That guy was so cunning.

1875
01:29:55,079 --> 01:29:56,919
You are just blur, period.

1876
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:01,239
Dear, I am not as blur as you think.

1877
01:30:01,799 --> 01:30:03,239
I took a photo of that guy.

1878
01:30:03,799 --> 01:30:04,599
Where?

1879
01:30:06,559 --> 01:30:07,479
This one.

1880
01:30:11,599 --> 01:30:13,999
Stop. Hold it there.

1881
01:30:14,119 --> 01:30:15,519
Very good.

1882
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:17,239
Wait.

1883
01:30:17,719 --> 01:30:18,519
Wear this.

1884
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:27,239
Lobang.

1885
01:30:27,959 --> 01:30:28,879
Is this you?

1886
01:30:29,559 --> 01:30:30,399
Sir.

1887
01:30:31,239 --> 01:30:32,559
Where did you get this photo from?

1888
01:30:32,839 --> 01:30:34,959
Lobang, I don't care
what you do in the past.

1889
01:30:35,079 --> 01:30:36,359
Now you are a diver.

1890
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:37,559
I am telling you this.

1891
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:38,959
We have our core values.

1892
01:30:39,079 --> 01:30:40,599
I have told you many times before.

1893
01:30:40,959 --> 01:30:42,199
As a bloody diver,

1894
01:30:42,759 --> 01:30:43,879
we swim in order.

1895
01:30:43,999 --> 01:30:44,839
In life too, we have to be honourable.

1896
01:30:44,959 --> 01:30:46,119
When we swim, we swim straight.

1897
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:49,079
As a person, we cannot be crooked.

1898
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:50,799
I don't make you shout your core values

1899
01:30:50,919 --> 01:30:52,799
so many times a day for no reason.

1900
01:30:52,919 --> 01:30:54,959
Lobang, if I shortchange you

1901
01:30:55,079 --> 01:30:56,199
for your boat PT everyday,

1902
01:30:56,319 --> 01:30:57,119
can you take that?

1903
01:30:58,879 --> 01:31:00,799
We are here to protect
the people of this country.

1904
01:31:00,919 --> 01:31:02,799
We are here to protect everybody.

1905
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:05,319
We will live and die by our core values.

1906
01:31:05,559 --> 01:31:07,719
Do you even remember our core values?

1907
01:31:08,359 --> 01:31:09,199
Yes, sir.

1908
01:31:11,479 --> 01:31:14,639
We, the frogmen of the Navy.

1909
01:31:14,839 --> 01:31:17,799
Demolition trained.

1910
01:31:18,279 --> 01:31:21,319
Rough and rugged bunch of warriors.

1911
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:24,759
There's nothing we can't do.

1912
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:28,319
We will overcome our enemies.

1913
01:31:28,599 --> 01:31:31,519
Nothing stands in our way.

1914
01:31:32,039 --> 01:31:35,039
We, the frogmen of the Navy.

1915
01:31:35,279 --> 01:31:36,119
Hooyah.

1916
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:37,759
For us go deep.

1917
01:31:56,519 --> 01:31:57,279
What do you want?

1918
01:31:57,399 --> 01:31:58,159
Titbits, please.

1919
01:31:58,279 --> 01:31:59,119
Help yourself.

1920
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:04,519
-Lobang.
-Hang on.

1921
01:32:07,599 --> 01:32:08,639
Damn.

1922
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:10,199
What's wrong?

1923
01:32:13,639 --> 01:32:14,439
What happened?

1924
01:32:14,879 --> 01:32:15,999
Lobang's sister is in trouble.

1925
01:32:18,959 --> 01:32:19,799
No answer.

1926
01:32:20,439 --> 01:32:21,199
No one is picking up?

1927
01:32:21,319 --> 01:32:22,159
No...

1928
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:25,519
Do you want my mom to
go to your place for a look?

1929
01:32:25,879 --> 01:32:27,719
Or do you want her to help you
call the police first?

1930
01:32:27,879 --> 01:32:29,039
She is very free.

1931
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:31,039
I know how to call the police too.

1932
01:32:31,159 --> 01:32:32,519
I just don't want to blow this matter up.

1933
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:38,039
No. I need to go out.

1934
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:38,959
I am going to look for Warrant Ong.

1935
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:44,199
You have to tell me the reason

1936
01:32:44,319 --> 01:32:45,359
before I can let you book out.

1937
01:32:45,799 --> 01:32:47,319
Sir, I can't tell you now.

1938
01:32:47,719 --> 01:32:48,999
It is not a small matter.

1939
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:51,639
Okay, wait.

1940
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:52,999
Thank you, sir.

1941
01:32:58,439 --> 01:32:59,279
Warrant Lum.

1942
01:32:59,439 --> 01:33:00,959
Sorry to disturb you at this hour.

1943
01:33:01,239 --> 01:33:02,919
Our man Lobang is here and

1944
01:33:03,039 --> 01:33:04,999
he seems to have
a very serious family issue.

1945
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:06,959
May I have permission to release him?

1946
01:33:07,479 --> 01:33:08,359
Did his mother die?

1947
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:09,999
Your mother die?

1948
01:33:10,799 --> 01:33:12,119
-No, sir.
-No.

1949
01:33:12,439 --> 01:33:13,399
Did his father die?

1950
01:33:13,519 --> 01:33:14,279
Your father die?

1951
01:33:14,399 --> 01:33:15,479
Died long time ago, sir.

1952
01:33:16,319 --> 01:33:17,399
He said he's been dead for some time.

1953
01:33:17,519 --> 01:33:18,839
House on fire?

1954
01:33:19,079 --> 01:33:19,959
Your house on fire?

1955
01:33:20,119 --> 01:33:20,919
No, sir.

1956
01:33:21,599 --> 01:33:22,399
No, sir.

1957
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:24,679
I think it is really
a very serious family issue.

1958
01:33:24,839 --> 01:33:26,279
He looks very anxious.

1959
01:33:27,319 --> 01:33:29,399
If he is not going to tell us
the real reason,

1960
01:33:29,519 --> 01:33:31,079
then I am sorry, I can't let him book out.

1961
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:33,599
Furthermore, we have a very important
diving lesson tomorrow morning.

1962
01:33:33,719 --> 01:33:35,359
And they need at least 8 hours of rest.

1963
01:33:36,679 --> 01:33:38,239
But, sir...

1964
01:33:40,079 --> 01:33:42,119
You should know that this man
is a professional con man.

1965
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:43,079
Plus liar,

1966
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:44,799
an ostensible star.

1967
01:33:45,079 --> 01:33:47,679
I think he needs to book out
to do some business outside.

1968
01:33:47,879 --> 01:33:49,559
Only when he is willing to
tell us the truth.

1969
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,079
If not, I will not let him book out.

1970
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:52,239
Alright, sir.

1971
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:53,719
Sorry to disturb you.

1972
01:33:54,959 --> 01:33:57,159
Why don't you tell them the truth?

1973
01:33:58,279 --> 01:34:00,399
I cashed in on his girlfriend before.
He won't believe me.

1974
01:34:01,079 --> 01:34:02,039
Even if he believes me,

1975
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:03,159
he will ask me to make a police report.

1976
01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:04,199
I can't make a police report.

1977
01:34:04,799 --> 01:34:06,159
I need to go out to resolve this.

1978
01:34:11,999 --> 01:34:12,799
How are you going to resolve this?

1979
01:34:13,759 --> 01:34:14,599
Are you going to sneak out?

1980
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:15,599
If not, how?

1981
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:19,439
You should know
how heavily guarded the gates are.

1982
01:34:19,639 --> 01:34:21,239
The fences are high and with barbed wires.

1983
01:34:21,399 --> 01:34:22,799
There are CCTV everywhere.

1984
01:34:22,919 --> 01:34:23,999
How can you get out?

1985
01:34:26,319 --> 01:34:27,679
Is there really no way out?

1986
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:43,999
Do you dare?

1987
01:34:54,839 --> 01:34:56,719
Are you really going to do this?

1988
01:34:57,279 --> 01:34:58,679
This is a serious matter.

1989
01:34:59,079 --> 01:34:59,879
I know.

1990
01:34:59,999 --> 01:35:01,079
But for my family,

1991
01:35:01,799 --> 01:35:02,599
I don't have a choice.

1992
01:35:04,599 --> 01:35:05,559
You won't understand.

1993
01:35:06,879 --> 01:35:07,679
Family.

1994
01:35:09,279 --> 01:35:10,039
Be careful.

1995
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:11,359
Let's go.

1996
01:35:17,719 --> 01:35:18,519
Family.

1997
01:35:49,919 --> 01:35:50,799
Are you okay?

1998
01:35:50,959 --> 01:35:51,759
I am good

1999
01:35:51,959 --> 01:35:53,559
especially with no No. 2 bellowing behind.

2000
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:55,039
A night swim is much enjoyable.

2001
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:56,199
Sorry to drag you into this.

2002
01:35:56,319 --> 01:35:58,239
Don't say that. Let's go.

2003
01:36:01,959 --> 01:36:03,119
No matter who you are.

2004
01:36:03,639 --> 01:36:05,399
Your actions are dangerous.

2005
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:08,519
Indicate your position now.

2006
01:36:17,279 --> 01:36:20,159
(Sembawang shipyard.)

2007
01:36:43,223 --> 01:36:44,383
48, stand by bed, now.

2008
01:37:18,996 --> 01:37:19,797
Wei.

2009
01:37:21,636 --> 01:37:22,557
Okay...

2010
01:37:24,557 --> 01:37:26,477
Mother came back to ask me for money.

2011
01:37:26,597 --> 01:37:29,316
I don't have any money, she hit me.

2012
01:37:29,436 --> 01:37:30,917
Give me money.

2013
01:37:32,997 --> 01:37:33,797
Mom.

2014
01:37:34,596 --> 01:37:37,197
Give me money.

2015
01:37:37,317 --> 01:37:38,676
Get some ropes.

2016
01:37:39,117 --> 01:37:40,437
Sorry aunty.

2017
01:37:43,437 --> 01:37:44,277
Mom.

2018
01:37:48,276 --> 01:37:49,397
You did this...

2019
01:37:50,397 --> 01:37:51,317
You unfilial son.

2020
01:37:53,916 --> 01:37:55,517
Lobang.

2021
01:37:59,076 --> 01:38:01,277
I am in so much pain.

2022
01:38:01,476 --> 01:38:04,716
Give me money.

2023
01:38:06,156 --> 01:38:08,436
I really...

2024
01:38:09,396 --> 01:38:10,197
Mom.

2025
01:38:12,797 --> 01:38:14,717
Give me money...

2026
01:38:40,317 --> 01:38:41,517
If you are not going to give me the money,

2027
01:38:42,636 --> 01:38:44,757
when you go back to camp

2028
01:38:45,797 --> 01:38:47,837
you will regret.

2029
01:38:49,877 --> 01:38:50,676
Mother.

2030
01:38:51,077 --> 01:38:52,437
What do you want me to do?

2031
01:38:53,357 --> 01:38:54,837
What do you want me to do?

2032
01:39:10,157 --> 01:39:11,316
You have to call the police.

2033
01:39:14,477 --> 01:39:15,996
This is a grave matter.

2034
01:39:16,116 --> 01:39:17,556
If I can, I would have told No. 2.

2035
01:39:17,676 --> 01:39:19,157
How can I turn my own mother in?

2036
01:39:36,077 --> 01:39:36,876
Hooyah.

2037
01:39:45,317 --> 01:39:46,116
Hooyah.

2038
01:40:03,516 --> 01:40:06,117
Don't call the police.

2039
01:40:10,557 --> 01:40:11,837
Don't call the police.

2040
01:40:13,397 --> 01:40:14,357
Please don't...

2041
01:40:14,477 --> 01:40:15,396
Police.

2042
01:40:16,797 --> 01:40:18,357
You unfilial son.

2043
01:40:18,477 --> 01:40:19,557
You really called the police

2044
01:40:19,677 --> 01:40:20,637
to arrest your mother.

2045
01:40:20,757 --> 01:40:22,476
How could you?

2046
01:40:22,596 --> 01:40:24,036
You ungrateful brat.

2047
01:40:58,157 --> 01:40:58,956
Settled?

2048
01:40:59,796 --> 01:41:00,597
Yes, sir.

2049
01:41:01,637 --> 01:41:02,436
Let's go.

2050
01:41:15,156 --> 01:41:17,436
Lobang, Wei-ming.

2051
01:41:18,237 --> 01:41:19,116
Good buddy.

2052
01:41:19,236 --> 01:41:20,117
Hero.

2053
01:41:29,717 --> 01:41:30,516
Hey guys.

2054
01:41:31,677 --> 01:41:32,837
Go change to your Smart 4

2055
01:41:32,957 --> 01:41:35,477
and muster downstairs in 15 minutes.

2056
01:41:35,597 --> 01:41:36,516
The OC wants to speak to you.

2057
01:41:36,837 --> 01:41:37,757
Yes, sir.

2058
01:41:38,237 --> 01:41:39,636
Sorry to drag you guys in.

2059
01:41:39,996 --> 01:41:41,397
It's okay, let's go.

2060
01:41:48,237 --> 01:41:51,516
48 watch your front, 48 attention.

2061
01:41:56,597 --> 01:41:57,396
Good evening, sir.

2062
01:41:58,037 --> 01:41:58,836
Good evening.

2063
01:41:59,597 --> 01:42:02,676
Class 48 IC Diver Tan Zhi-hao
reporting strength.

2064
01:42:03,156 --> 01:42:05,357
Total strength 80, present strength 80.

2065
01:42:06,396 --> 01:42:07,197
Very good.

2066
01:42:07,797 --> 01:42:10,077
Stand your men at ease and join your class.

2067
01:42:11,076 --> 01:42:12,077
Permission to carry on, sir.

2068
01:42:12,797 --> 01:42:13,596
Carry on.

2069
01:42:16,197 --> 01:42:19,596
48 watch your front, 48 at ease.

2070
01:42:33,197 --> 01:42:33,996
Gentlemen,

2071
01:42:35,637 --> 01:42:37,236
I believe you are already aware

2072
01:42:38,237 --> 01:42:39,677
of what happened earlier tonight.

2073
01:42:41,916 --> 01:42:46,037
Diver Lobang asked for permission
to book out.

2074
01:42:47,436 --> 01:42:49,836
But he did not provide valid reasons.

2075
01:42:50,717 --> 01:42:53,597
And as such, his request was turned down.

2076
01:42:56,436 --> 01:42:57,996
He saw no alternatives

2077
01:42:59,196 --> 01:43:00,996
but to leave the camp without permission.

2078
01:43:03,276 --> 01:43:04,157
And he knew

2079
01:43:05,117 --> 01:43:07,637
he could not get pass the front
guardroom without detection,

2080
01:43:08,796 --> 01:43:09,957
so he did it by sea.

2081
01:43:11,957 --> 01:43:14,117
Putting what he learned here to use.

2082
01:43:15,557 --> 01:43:16,637
Risking his life

2083
01:43:17,837 --> 01:43:19,277
together with Diver Wei-ming

2084
01:43:21,117 --> 01:43:22,476
in order to save his sister.

2085
01:43:25,197 --> 01:43:28,037
Unauthorised absence is a serious offence.

2086
01:43:29,676 --> 01:43:30,876
But I also saw

2087
01:43:31,637 --> 01:43:32,957
team spirit between them.

2088
01:43:35,597 --> 01:43:38,357
And that is what we teach you here in NDU.

2089
01:43:42,237 --> 01:43:44,717
Diver Lobang broke the rules

2090
01:43:46,197 --> 01:43:47,597
in order to do the right thing.

2091
01:43:49,157 --> 01:43:51,237
And that raises the moral dilemma.

2092
01:43:53,277 --> 01:43:54,636
How do we choose

2093
01:43:55,277 --> 01:43:56,957
between doing the right things

2094
01:43:58,277 --> 01:43:59,517
and doing things right?

2095
01:44:01,397 --> 01:44:02,237
Lobang

2096
01:44:03,996 --> 01:44:05,076
was wrongfully right.

2097
01:44:06,036 --> 01:44:06,837
Yet

2098
01:44:08,837 --> 01:44:09,756
rightfully wrong.

2099
01:44:11,717 --> 01:44:15,597
And so, we have to take
the necessary actions.

2100
01:44:19,557 --> 01:44:21,036
-Lum.
-Yes, sir.

2101
01:44:21,237 --> 01:44:21,996
Take over.

2102
01:44:22,116 --> 01:44:22,917
Yes, sir.

2103
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:31,356
Diver Lobang, front and centre.

2104
01:44:31,517 --> 01:44:32,316
Yes, sir.

2105
01:44:36,437 --> 01:44:37,596
Explain to me.

2106
01:44:37,917 --> 01:44:39,957
Why did you jeopardise your life

2107
01:44:40,116 --> 01:44:41,436
and the life of your swim buddy

2108
01:44:41,597 --> 01:44:43,116
by taking the most dangerous route?

2109
01:44:43,757 --> 01:44:44,556
Sir.

2110
01:44:45,077 --> 01:44:47,357
I knew it would be impossible for me
to escape through the front gate

2111
01:44:47,717 --> 01:44:49,476
because there were too many guards on duty.

2112
01:44:50,597 --> 01:44:51,876
But, sir, you know what?

2113
01:44:52,917 --> 01:44:54,036
When I was about to give up

2114
01:44:54,516 --> 01:44:55,557
I saw the frogman from the sea

2115
01:44:55,677 --> 01:44:57,477
pointing his finger at the top
of the HQ building.

2116
01:44:59,037 --> 01:44:59,916
Then I realised

2117
01:45:00,117 --> 01:45:01,956
that was the message
from the frogman from the sea.

2118
01:45:02,997 --> 01:45:04,197
Telling me that as a diver

2119
01:45:04,317 --> 01:45:05,477
I shouldn't give up easily

2120
01:45:05,757 --> 01:45:07,197
because nothing stands in my way.

2121
01:45:08,316 --> 01:45:10,716
But at that point of time,
I still don't know what to do

2122
01:45:11,397 --> 01:45:12,516
until I saw it fly.

2123
01:45:14,037 --> 01:45:14,877
Really, sir.

2124
01:45:15,557 --> 01:45:17,076
I saw it flew across the Parade Square,

2125
01:45:17,397 --> 01:45:18,756
over the top of the HQ building

2126
01:45:18,876 --> 01:45:19,716
towards the sea.

2127
01:45:20,877 --> 01:45:22,716
Then suddenly I realised the hidden message.

2128
01:45:23,397 --> 01:45:24,636
I remembered what you said before.

2129
01:45:25,956 --> 01:45:26,997
If you swim towards the right,

2130
01:45:27,117 --> 01:45:28,197
you will reach Sembawang Park

2131
01:45:28,677 --> 01:45:29,997
and we can book out straight from there.

2132
01:45:31,116 --> 01:45:32,037
That's where I booked out.

2133
01:45:34,077 --> 01:45:34,877
No, sir.

2134
01:45:35,076 --> 01:45:36,036
That's where I escaped.

2135
01:45:36,557 --> 01:45:39,917
So now you are blaming me for teaching you

2136
01:45:40,037 --> 01:45:43,356
to take the most dangerous route
to leave camp. Is that so?

2137
01:45:43,476 --> 01:45:44,277
No, sir.

2138
01:45:44,757 --> 01:45:45,557
Then?

2139
01:45:45,797 --> 01:45:46,596
Sir.

2140
01:45:47,157 --> 01:45:49,037
It's not dangerous
until you forget that it is.

2141
01:45:49,797 --> 01:45:50,796
We never forget that.

2142
01:45:51,756 --> 01:45:53,037
We did it very carefully.

2143
01:45:53,916 --> 01:45:55,836
If it is easy, we don't want to do it

2144
01:45:56,916 --> 01:45:57,957
and we are trained for it.

2145
01:45:59,277 --> 01:46:01,476
Sir, the sea is our comfort zone.

2146
01:46:01,637 --> 01:46:02,637
The sea is our domain.

2147
01:46:02,957 --> 01:46:04,157
Danger is our business.

2148
01:46:06,797 --> 01:46:08,037
I really had no choice, sir.

2149
01:46:09,557 --> 01:46:12,197
Lobang, I am very impressed

2150
01:46:12,597 --> 01:46:15,276
that you hold all our divers' core values

2151
01:46:15,477 --> 01:46:17,597
in your heart and in your head.

2152
01:46:19,317 --> 01:46:20,277
Join back your class.

2153
01:46:20,436 --> 01:46:21,276
Thank you, sir.

2154
01:46:26,076 --> 01:46:26,916
48.

2155
01:46:27,797 --> 01:46:28,836
As your course warrant,

2156
01:46:30,036 --> 01:46:31,517
it is my responsibility

2157
01:46:31,956 --> 01:46:32,957
to train you hard.

2158
01:46:33,797 --> 01:46:34,917
But at the same time,

2159
01:46:35,877 --> 01:46:38,477
I will not overlook your safety.

2160
01:46:41,157 --> 01:46:42,597
I trained you to be divers.

2161
01:46:45,077 --> 01:46:47,517
What Lobang and Wei-ming did

2162
01:46:48,237 --> 01:46:50,877
is something I refuse to accept.

2163
01:46:52,716 --> 01:46:54,477
By putting your lives at danger,

2164
01:46:55,997 --> 01:46:59,676
it's really jeopardising this entire course.

2165
01:47:00,756 --> 01:47:02,357
It is also my responsibility

2166
01:47:03,276 --> 01:47:04,596
to understand your problems.

2167
01:47:06,597 --> 01:47:07,997
If I cannot solve your problems,

2168
01:47:08,117 --> 01:47:09,117
I can guarantee you

2169
01:47:09,917 --> 01:47:10,797
the next in rank

2170
01:47:11,037 --> 01:47:13,116
following the chain of command
will be able to.

2171
01:47:15,077 --> 01:47:18,156
It takes a man courage to admit his mistake.

2172
01:47:19,637 --> 01:47:20,477
And I admit.

2173
01:47:22,557 --> 01:47:25,356
I did not understand Lobang's problems.

2174
01:47:27,477 --> 01:47:28,476
For every mistake

2175
01:47:29,676 --> 01:47:30,837
there will be a punishment.

2176
01:47:33,516 --> 01:47:35,796
I have no excuse for my mistake.

2177
01:47:37,356 --> 01:47:38,196
For that,

2178
01:47:38,556 --> 01:47:39,636
I will punish myself

2179
01:47:40,277 --> 01:47:41,517
by doing a hundred push-ups.

2180
01:47:48,756 --> 01:47:49,836
48. One for all.

2181
01:47:49,956 --> 01:47:50,916
All for one.

2182
01:48:21,756 --> 01:48:22,797
What do you want to eat?

2183
01:48:23,277 --> 01:48:24,396
I will bring back for you tomorrow.

2184
01:48:25,236 --> 01:48:26,397
It's okay, I have meat jerky.

2185
01:48:33,917 --> 01:48:36,597
Enjoy your weekend.

2186
01:48:36,717 --> 01:48:38,877
Lobang, sitting down?

2187
01:48:38,997 --> 01:48:39,797
No, sir.

2188
01:48:39,917 --> 01:48:41,357
Seven extras not enough.
You want me to upsize?

2189
01:48:41,477 --> 01:48:42,276
No, sir.

2190
01:48:42,597 --> 01:48:43,836
Handle your weapon properly, understand?

2191
01:48:43,956 --> 01:48:44,796
Yes, sir.

2192
01:48:46,637 --> 01:48:47,637
Good afternoon, sir.

2193
01:48:47,877 --> 01:48:48,957
What's so good about afternoon?

2194
01:48:49,236 --> 01:48:50,397
Can't you see I am on duty?

2195
01:48:50,717 --> 01:48:51,636
You F.O.

2196
01:48:51,917 --> 01:48:52,716
UFO?

2197
01:48:53,556 --> 01:48:54,917
The whole lot of you

2198
01:48:55,037 --> 01:48:55,836
F.O.

2199
01:48:56,277 --> 01:48:57,317
Yes, sir.

2200
01:48:59,076 --> 01:49:01,397
Don't worry, we'll take care
of your sister for you.

2201
01:49:01,517 --> 01:49:02,957
-Thank you.
-Hey guys.

2202
01:49:03,156 --> 01:49:05,556
Lobang's sister is very pretty.

2203
01:49:05,676 --> 01:49:07,236
Too bad, she's mine.

2204
01:49:07,397 --> 01:49:08,796
You can ask him if you don't believe me.

2205
01:49:08,916 --> 01:49:09,996
Right, my in-law?

2206
01:49:10,116 --> 01:49:11,676
In-law my foot.

2207
01:49:11,796 --> 01:49:12,797
Don't be shameless.

2208
01:49:12,917 --> 01:49:13,716
I'm just joking.

2209
01:49:13,836 --> 01:49:14,877
Illegal gathering?

2210
01:49:16,476 --> 01:49:17,357
If you don't want to leave,

2211
01:49:17,556 --> 01:49:19,197
you can all stay with me for duties.

2212
01:49:19,877 --> 01:49:21,077
Ten seconds to get out of my face.

2213
01:49:21,317 --> 01:49:22,116
10.

2214
01:49:22,517 --> 01:49:23,316
7.

2215
01:49:24,036 --> 01:49:24,837
5.

2216
01:49:25,037 --> 01:49:26,597
-3.5.
-Enjoy your weekend, sir.

2217
01:49:26,796 --> 01:49:27,636
2.22.

2218
01:49:28,236 --> 01:49:29,196
1.25.

2219
01:49:33,317 --> 01:49:34,116
Good afternoon, sir.

2220
01:49:36,276 --> 01:49:37,277
Hello.

2221
01:49:37,397 --> 01:49:38,237
What time will you be back?

2222
01:49:38,357 --> 01:49:39,117
I can't make it tonight.

2223
01:49:39,237 --> 01:49:40,917
I'm on urgent duty.

2224
01:49:41,796 --> 01:49:43,637
You got extra duty?

2225
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:02,237
Wake up your idea.

2226
01:50:08,556 --> 01:50:09,396
It's him.

2227
01:50:11,277 --> 01:50:13,236
Boss. How come you didn't inform us
that you are out?

2228
01:50:13,356 --> 01:50:14,877
We could have gone to get you.

2229
01:50:16,637 --> 01:50:17,436
Anyway.

2230
01:50:17,957 --> 01:50:19,356
He is our boss now.

2231
01:50:19,637 --> 01:50:21,117
You understand, right?
It's like in the army.

2232
01:50:21,516 --> 01:50:23,117
When there is no sergeant,
there will be an acting sergeant.

2233
01:50:23,237 --> 01:50:26,316
When you are not around,
we have an acting boss too.

2234
01:50:26,916 --> 01:50:28,997
Come over and have a chicken wing.

2235
01:50:29,676 --> 01:50:30,597
What is the meaning of this?

2236
01:50:30,717 --> 01:50:32,517
They owe us money. You used to do this too.

2237
01:50:34,317 --> 01:50:35,757
Stand up and leave here.

2238
01:50:36,837 --> 01:50:37,877
Hey!

2239
01:50:40,677 --> 01:50:42,677
These are my men.
How dare you ask them to leave?

2240
01:50:42,797 --> 01:50:43,956
What do you take me for?

2241
01:50:44,676 --> 01:50:46,716
Their mothers gave birth to them,

2242
01:50:47,316 --> 01:50:48,597
not to be bullied by you.

2243
01:50:48,876 --> 01:50:50,237
Boss, you shaved off your head

2244
01:50:50,357 --> 01:50:52,317
to be a soldier or to be a monk?

2245
01:50:52,437 --> 01:50:54,396
Your compassion frightens me.

2246
01:50:56,277 --> 01:50:57,597
If you want to bring them away,

2247
01:50:57,717 --> 01:50:58,836
then make sure you can win me in a fight.

2248
01:51:35,157 --> 01:51:37,077
Boss. Actually we knew from the start,

2249
01:51:37,197 --> 01:51:38,196
he wouldn't win you in this fight.

2250
01:51:38,316 --> 01:51:40,157
-Right?
-Yes.

2251
01:51:40,836 --> 01:51:42,597
We are still the
Six Beasts of Tiong Bahru, right?

2252
01:51:43,877 --> 01:51:44,717
I announce

2253
01:51:44,916 --> 01:51:46,157
Six Beasts of Tiong Bahru...

2254
01:51:46,277 --> 01:51:47,076
Disband.

2255
01:52:12,996 --> 01:52:13,797
Boss.

2256
01:52:19,116 --> 01:52:19,917
Settled?

2257
01:52:20,196 --> 01:52:20,997
Settled.

2258
01:52:22,077 --> 01:52:22,836
Settled?

2259
01:52:22,956 --> 01:52:23,717
Yes.

2260
01:52:23,837 --> 01:52:24,756
Did you do the right thing?

2261
01:52:24,876 --> 01:52:26,397
Yeah. I feel really good now.

2262
01:52:26,877 --> 01:52:27,636
Great.

2263
01:52:27,756 --> 01:52:29,597
Hooyah.

2264
01:53:21,917 --> 01:53:23,037
Fire in the hole.

2265
01:54:15,557 --> 01:54:16,797
Stay with...

2266
01:54:36,516 --> 01:54:39,117
Move.

2267
01:55:17,637 --> 01:55:21,156
This is the moment that
all divers are waiting for.

2268
01:55:21,957 --> 01:55:23,157
Ladies and gentlemen,

2269
01:55:23,676 --> 01:55:25,157
the Hell week

2270
01:55:25,476 --> 01:55:26,556
begins.

2271
01:55:31,757 --> 01:55:33,996
We've heard many rumours about Hell week.

2272
01:55:34,116 --> 01:55:36,477
But actually, is this really necessary

2273
01:55:36,597 --> 01:55:38,277
for us to go through all these shit

2274
01:55:38,397 --> 01:55:39,957
just to prove that we are divers?

2275
01:56:06,117 --> 01:56:08,997
Okay, I know that this is
just team work training.

2276
01:56:09,677 --> 01:56:12,797
No, I think this is to
test my determination.

2277
01:56:13,437 --> 01:56:14,837
I know what they are up to.

2278
01:56:15,276 --> 01:56:17,076
They are trying to break me mentally.

2279
01:56:17,316 --> 01:56:18,717
They want to see me giving up

2280
01:56:18,996 --> 01:56:20,316
but they will never succeed.

2281
01:56:20,796 --> 01:56:22,277
I am mentally well prepared.

2282
01:56:22,637 --> 01:56:25,836
The only enemy that is going to
stand in my way is me.

2283
01:56:26,157 --> 01:56:27,197
Myself.

2284
01:56:39,276 --> 01:56:40,236
Get your act together.

2285
01:56:45,276 --> 01:56:46,677
Capsize drill now.

2286
01:56:46,956 --> 01:56:48,197
Yes, sir.

2287
01:56:51,357 --> 01:56:52,277
Boat 2.

2288
01:56:52,397 --> 01:56:53,157
It's okay.

2289
01:56:53,277 --> 01:56:55,397
We've got the whole weekend
for you to learn.

2290
01:56:56,157 --> 01:56:56,997
Slowly.

2291
01:56:58,197 --> 01:57:00,156
Can't even flip your bloody boat.

2292
01:57:01,317 --> 01:57:02,916
Integrity. You better help each other.

2293
01:57:03,036 --> 01:57:03,917
Boat 2.

2294
01:57:10,356 --> 01:57:11,796
You're a bunch of sorry souls.

2295
01:57:12,117 --> 01:57:12,957
Look at you.

2296
01:57:13,077 --> 01:57:13,956
Take your time.

2297
01:57:14,916 --> 01:57:18,876
2, 6, up.

2298
01:57:18,996 --> 01:57:19,797
Boat 2.

2299
01:57:19,917 --> 01:57:22,116
You're like a dirty underwear
hanging outside.

2300
01:57:28,317 --> 01:57:31,877
2, 6, up.

2301
01:57:34,236 --> 01:57:35,957
Once you have finished your capsize drill,

2302
01:57:36,077 --> 01:57:37,157
head back to the shore.

2303
01:57:37,277 --> 01:57:38,597
Well done Boat 1.

2304
01:57:38,997 --> 01:57:40,557
Boat 2, you better hurry up.

2305
01:57:44,076 --> 01:57:45,117
Safety...

2306
01:57:46,157 --> 01:57:47,397
Boat 2 take your time.

2307
01:57:47,517 --> 01:57:49,476
Never mind.
The hammer is going to drop on you.

2308
01:57:51,276 --> 01:57:52,757
Let's go, boat 2.

2309
01:57:54,717 --> 01:57:57,276
Boat 2, the boat IC better take charge

2310
01:57:57,396 --> 01:57:58,956
and command your boat crew members.

2311
01:57:59,076 --> 01:58:02,037
Right now you guys are operating
in a very messy fashion.

2312
01:58:11,397 --> 01:58:12,597
Well done Boat 2.

2313
01:58:12,876 --> 01:58:14,796
You are the last, again.

2314
01:58:15,996 --> 01:58:18,156
Hit the surf now.

2315
01:58:51,477 --> 01:58:53,517
I am a naval diver

2316
01:58:53,637 --> 01:58:54,957
frogman from the sea.

2317
01:58:55,116 --> 01:58:57,516
Hooyah! Nothing stands in our way.

2318
01:58:57,756 --> 01:58:59,957
Eat up.

2319
01:59:16,956 --> 01:59:17,796
Mom.

2320
01:59:19,037 --> 01:59:20,597
I see dead people.

2321
01:59:22,077 --> 01:59:24,036
The only time we don't see demons

2322
01:59:24,156 --> 01:59:25,637
is during chow time.

2323
01:59:26,556 --> 01:59:27,437
We see

2324
01:59:28,917 --> 01:59:30,636
only angels.

2325
01:59:35,957 --> 01:59:37,437
Because during training

2326
01:59:37,757 --> 01:59:38,916
all our instructors

2327
01:59:39,036 --> 01:59:41,157
are like devils from hell.

2328
01:59:41,436 --> 01:59:42,756
Welcome to CDC.

2329
01:59:42,876 --> 01:59:43,997
My territory.

2330
01:59:44,117 --> 01:59:45,597
Welcome to hell.

2331
01:59:47,076 --> 01:59:48,156
But now.

2332
01:59:50,237 --> 01:59:53,997
I think the reason for me to see
so many angels around us.

2333
01:59:54,197 --> 01:59:57,917
It's because during the meal time
or what we call the chow time

2334
01:59:58,077 --> 02:00:00,636
is the only time when all instructors

2335
02:00:00,756 --> 02:00:03,437
stop yelling and pointing
their fingers at us.

2336
02:00:03,837 --> 02:00:06,317
But treat us like pampered little babies.

2337
02:00:06,957 --> 02:00:08,556
They are like angels to us.

2338
02:00:08,877 --> 02:00:11,237
Or at least for the time being.

2339
02:00:30,756 --> 02:00:31,637
Excuse me.

2340
02:00:47,157 --> 02:00:49,277
Excuse me.

2341
02:00:49,397 --> 02:00:51,837
Emergency! Very important.

2342
02:00:56,436 --> 02:00:59,196
Excuse me, I cannot take it anymore.

2343
02:01:05,597 --> 02:01:06,396
How can you take it

2344
02:01:06,516 --> 02:01:08,357
without washing your faces for so many days?

2345
02:01:08,796 --> 02:01:09,876
Who wants to wash their face?

2346
02:01:09,996 --> 02:01:14,076
I've got this 3-in-1
Nivea man mud serum foam.

2347
02:01:16,037 --> 02:01:17,237
Let me demonstrate.

2348
02:01:20,357 --> 02:01:21,317
Hold this.

2349
02:01:22,277 --> 02:01:24,876
First you apply the mud on your face.

2350
02:01:25,677 --> 02:01:28,956
The mud will help you unclog your pores.

2351
02:01:32,837 --> 02:01:34,037
Then you add water.

2352
02:01:38,916 --> 02:01:41,556
The water will help you.

2353
02:01:43,997 --> 02:01:47,237
The water will help you
remove the facial oil.

2354
02:01:49,437 --> 02:01:52,757
The serum not only hydrates
but brightens up your skin.

2355
02:01:53,637 --> 02:01:54,717
It's really easy.

2356
02:01:55,716 --> 02:01:56,796
It's very simple.

2357
02:01:59,717 --> 02:02:01,757
Now everybody can be like me.

2358
02:02:01,877 --> 02:02:04,437
Fresh, new, handsome diver.

2359
02:02:04,596 --> 02:02:07,037
Come try.

2360
02:02:09,797 --> 02:02:11,997
I think if we can make it in NDU,

2361
02:02:12,837 --> 02:02:14,196
we can make it in life.

2362
02:02:15,276 --> 02:02:16,197
How about you?

2363
02:02:17,957 --> 02:02:20,157
I aim to work at KPMG.

2364
02:02:22,517 --> 02:02:24,077
As a GPMG gunner?

2365
02:02:25,476 --> 02:02:26,957
KPMG.

2366
02:02:27,396 --> 02:02:28,917
As an accountant.

2367
02:02:30,917 --> 02:02:32,676
The auditing company.

2368
02:02:33,837 --> 02:02:35,117
Wise choice.

2369
02:02:35,637 --> 02:02:37,476
I see you have a bright future.

2370
02:02:38,037 --> 02:02:40,476
But the daily half an hour
so-called toilet break

2371
02:02:40,596 --> 02:02:42,516
is still our favourite activity.

2372
02:02:42,677 --> 02:02:43,757
Because we could sleep

2373
02:02:44,076 --> 02:02:45,677
pee and shit

2374
02:02:45,876 --> 02:02:48,597
without any disturbance
from any instructors.

2375
02:02:49,037 --> 02:02:50,277
It's like heaven.

2376
02:02:52,277 --> 02:02:53,196
But after that

2377
02:02:53,877 --> 02:02:55,917
the same old shit carry on.

2378
02:03:52,557 --> 02:03:54,797
Because we are amphibious diver fighters,

2379
02:03:54,917 --> 02:03:57,237
we are trained to fight in any terrain.

2380
02:03:57,437 --> 02:03:59,877
Sea and land are our comfort zones.

2381
02:04:00,197 --> 02:04:00,957
Unlike the army

2382
02:04:01,077 --> 02:04:02,556
who do their SOC on land.
(SOC: standard obstacle course.)

2383
02:04:02,676 --> 02:04:04,476
We have our very own SOC,

2384
02:04:04,757 --> 02:04:05,837
the Sea Circuit.

2385
02:04:06,077 --> 02:04:07,877
Both on land and sea.

2386
02:04:08,837 --> 02:04:09,876
Double strenuous.

2387
02:04:15,756 --> 02:04:18,276
Sea Circuit is like a journey of life to us.

2388
02:04:18,396 --> 02:04:19,997
We need to strive to survive.

2389
02:04:20,316 --> 02:04:21,276
We need to run,

2390
02:04:21,516 --> 02:04:22,356
swim,

2391
02:04:22,476 --> 02:04:23,237
climb

2392
02:04:23,357 --> 02:04:24,156
and jump.

2393
02:04:24,357 --> 02:04:26,637
Clearing all the obstacles in front of us.

2394
02:04:43,877 --> 02:04:45,156
Hei-long, hooyah.

2395
02:04:45,317 --> 02:04:46,317
Hooyah.

2396
02:04:56,757 --> 02:04:57,557
Tonight,

2397
02:04:57,797 --> 02:04:59,837
they are going to invite us to spa.

2398
02:05:00,636 --> 02:05:02,436
Ice cold spa.

2399
02:05:03,197 --> 02:05:05,637
This is the infamous cold treatment.

2400
02:05:06,117 --> 02:05:08,037
It's like the ice bucket challenge.

2401
02:05:08,157 --> 02:05:10,157
From hell.

2402
02:05:10,637 --> 02:05:13,716
And we are all being nominated
by our instructors.

2403
02:05:40,317 --> 02:05:43,517
Rough and rugged bunch of warriors.

2404
02:05:43,637 --> 02:05:46,956
There's nothing we can't do.

2405
02:05:47,556 --> 02:05:50,556
We will overcome our enemies.

2406
02:05:50,837 --> 02:05:53,517
Nothing stands in our way.

2407
02:05:54,477 --> 02:05:57,717
We, the frogmen of the Navy.

2408
02:05:57,837 --> 02:05:58,637
Hooyah.

2409
02:05:58,757 --> 02:06:00,156
For us go deep.

2410
02:06:08,477 --> 02:06:11,277
Lean back.

2411
02:06:16,077 --> 02:06:19,356
Open your eyes.

2412
02:06:25,317 --> 02:06:26,676
So, Ken Chow.

2413
02:06:27,597 --> 02:06:28,956
I have some good news for you.

2414
02:06:29,877 --> 02:06:31,437
Your application to the Air Force
has been approved.

2415
02:06:32,997 --> 02:06:33,837
If you want,

2416
02:06:34,037 --> 02:06:35,357
you can ring the bell now and join them.

2417
02:06:36,996 --> 02:06:37,836
Sir.

2418
02:06:37,956 --> 02:06:38,796
Thank you

2419
02:06:38,916 --> 02:06:39,756
but no thank you.

2420
02:06:40,677 --> 02:06:41,877
I have been through so much.

2421
02:06:42,636 --> 02:06:43,836
I'm not going to give up now.

2422
02:06:45,636 --> 02:06:47,076
I want to be a naval diver.

2423
02:06:47,757 --> 02:06:49,517
I want to swim in the deep blue sea.

2424
02:06:50,957 --> 02:06:52,277
Nothing stands in my way.

2425
02:06:52,877 --> 02:06:53,796
Not even you, sir.

2426
02:06:54,396 --> 02:06:55,236
Good.

2427
02:06:55,397 --> 02:06:56,316
That's what I want to hear.

2428
02:06:56,477 --> 02:07:02,357
Sir.

2429
02:07:02,676 --> 02:07:04,757
What is it? Diver Handsome.

2430
02:07:04,877 --> 02:07:05,676
Sorry, sir.

2431
02:07:05,837 --> 02:07:07,476
Permission to go toilet.

2432
02:07:07,596 --> 02:07:08,957
No, are you trying to slack off?

2433
02:07:09,077 --> 02:07:10,677
No, sir, I'm not trying anything.

2434
02:07:10,797 --> 02:07:12,117
I really want to go.

2435
02:07:16,317 --> 02:07:17,117
Sir.

2436
02:07:17,676 --> 02:07:18,717
No need already.

2437
02:07:21,516 --> 02:07:22,917
Handsome, you farted?

2438
02:07:23,196 --> 02:07:24,036
No, sir.

2439
02:07:26,637 --> 02:07:27,597
You shitted?

2440
02:07:28,157 --> 02:07:29,037
No, sir.

2441
02:07:29,877 --> 02:07:30,876
I have diarrhea.

2442
02:07:58,037 --> 02:07:59,957
The fifth sunrise is when we are in

2443
02:08:00,077 --> 02:08:02,397
our worst physical and mental condition.

2444
02:08:02,997 --> 02:08:04,677
We are like a bunch of zombies

2445
02:08:04,836 --> 02:08:06,957
moving around by our instinct only.

2446
02:08:07,317 --> 02:08:08,676
Although our morals are high

2447
02:08:08,796 --> 02:08:10,997
with only half a day of shit left.

2448
02:08:11,237 --> 02:08:14,517
We are still too tired
to feel happy about it.

2449
02:08:15,036 --> 02:08:18,237
We just hope that Hell week
could end as soon as possible

2450
02:08:18,516 --> 02:08:20,676
because we are so freaking tired.

2451
02:08:22,116 --> 02:08:22,997
Last day,

2452
02:08:23,436 --> 02:08:24,477
last segment,

2453
02:08:24,717 --> 02:08:26,117
last burst of fire,

2454
02:08:26,477 --> 02:08:28,716
we have all been pushed to our limits.

2455
02:08:29,237 --> 02:08:31,677
Like what No. 2
and all my tuition teachers said.

2456
02:08:31,997 --> 02:08:33,516
It's all in our minds.

2457
02:08:33,996 --> 02:08:35,316
Our strong mental power

2458
02:08:35,436 --> 02:08:38,196
is now taking over our physical fitness.

2459
02:08:49,277 --> 02:08:50,117
Some say

2460
02:08:50,436 --> 02:08:52,917
everybody has their own Hell week in life.

2461
02:08:53,237 --> 02:08:54,077
For some,

2462
02:08:54,197 --> 02:08:55,236
they were born with it.

2463
02:08:55,476 --> 02:08:56,757
They have no choice

2464
02:08:56,877 --> 02:08:58,437
but to embrace it.

2465
02:09:00,636 --> 02:09:01,397
For some,

2466
02:09:01,517 --> 02:09:03,357
They created their own Hell week

2467
02:09:03,477 --> 02:09:05,277
and made themselves suffer from it,

2468
02:09:05,757 --> 02:09:06,996
wasting time and effort

2469
02:09:07,116 --> 02:09:08,556
and gained nothing from it.

2470
02:09:09,317 --> 02:09:11,597
This stupidity and retardation

2471
02:09:11,717 --> 02:09:13,317
is really what they asked for.

2472
02:09:14,277 --> 02:09:15,677
But this is how they grow

2473
02:09:15,957 --> 02:09:18,317
and grow in the hard way.

2474
02:09:20,237 --> 02:09:22,197
After these five days in hell,

2475
02:09:22,517 --> 02:09:23,916
nobody is the best here.

2476
02:09:24,917 --> 02:09:27,876
We are better than the best.

2477
02:09:29,957 --> 02:09:30,917
Hell week

2478
02:09:31,077 --> 02:09:32,757
or just a small hurdle in life

2479
02:09:33,117 --> 02:09:35,237
really depends on how you interpret it,

2480
02:09:35,556 --> 02:09:37,437
handle it and overcome it.

2481
02:09:41,477 --> 02:09:42,237
Never give up

2482
02:09:42,357 --> 02:09:44,757
is what we've learned these five days.

2483
02:09:45,156 --> 02:09:47,717
Pain is weakness leaving our bodies.

2484
02:09:47,957 --> 02:09:49,637
The tougher the instructors push us,

2485
02:09:49,757 --> 02:09:50,916
the tougher we are.

2486
02:09:51,437 --> 02:09:52,677
To those before me,

2487
02:09:52,797 --> 02:09:53,997
to those here with me,

2488
02:09:54,117 --> 02:09:56,076
to those that come after me.

2489
02:09:56,597 --> 02:10:00,117
God, please make me
worthy of the frogmen brotherhood.

2490
02:10:12,477 --> 02:10:14,117
48. Muster here now.

2491
02:10:19,356 --> 02:10:20,237
Class 48.

2492
02:10:20,517 --> 02:10:22,236
Hooyah.

2493
02:10:22,397 --> 02:10:23,796
Are you ready to secure?

2494
02:10:23,997 --> 02:10:26,477
Yes, sir.

2495
02:10:26,597 --> 02:10:27,516
Are you tired?

2496
02:10:27,636 --> 02:10:29,316
No, sir.

2497
02:10:29,436 --> 02:10:30,597
That's not good enough.

2498
02:10:31,317 --> 02:10:32,597
Go get wet and sandy now.

2499
02:10:34,437 --> 02:10:35,916
For the past five days,

2500
02:10:37,277 --> 02:10:38,157
all of you

2501
02:10:38,556 --> 02:10:40,877
have undergone the toughest training

2502
02:10:40,997 --> 02:10:42,077
in the SAF.

2503
02:10:43,397 --> 02:10:46,956
You are the elite frogmen of the Navy.

2504
02:10:47,676 --> 02:10:49,596
You will always remember

2505
02:10:50,877 --> 02:10:53,756
in the darkest and lowest time of your life.

2506
02:10:54,996 --> 02:10:56,516
You will always remember this day

2507
02:10:56,636 --> 02:10:58,517
as the most defining moment of your life.

2508
02:10:59,357 --> 02:11:01,716
And you will be able to overcome

2509
02:11:02,036 --> 02:11:03,797
any adversity that confronts you.

2510
02:11:04,157 --> 02:11:04,997
I

2511
02:11:05,796 --> 02:11:06,636
declare

2512
02:11:12,396 --> 02:11:13,596
Hell week secure.

2513
02:11:18,557 --> 02:11:19,676
Tough times don't last

2514
02:11:19,997 --> 02:11:21,356
but tough men do.

2515
02:11:21,716 --> 02:11:23,916
I finally realised the meaning of

2516
02:11:24,077 --> 02:11:25,836
nothing stands in our way.

2517
02:11:26,636 --> 02:11:29,756
We were all chosen
for a very special reason.

2518
02:11:30,356 --> 02:11:31,277
When we could overcome

2519
02:11:31,397 --> 02:11:34,796
the high demand in both our
mental and physical abilities,

2520
02:11:35,316 --> 02:11:38,076
what hurdle in life that
we could not overcome?

2521
02:11:38,796 --> 02:11:39,677
Nothing.

2522
02:11:40,277 --> 02:11:41,876
Absolutely nothing

2523
02:11:41,996 --> 02:11:43,836
could break us anymore.

2524
02:13:28,877 --> 02:13:29,756
Well done. Good job.

2525
02:13:30,077 --> 02:13:30,836
Thank you, sir.

2526
02:13:30,956 --> 02:13:31,757
Well done.

2527
02:13:36,596 --> 02:13:37,436
Son.

2528
02:13:37,716 --> 02:13:39,356
Well done, finally.

2529
02:13:39,476 --> 02:13:40,757
Hey guys, they are my parents

2530
02:13:40,877 --> 02:13:42,156
and they are my good friends.

2531
02:13:42,396 --> 02:13:44,036
Hello uncle. Hello aunty.

2532
02:13:45,036 --> 02:13:46,757
Not war, make love.

2533
02:13:50,597 --> 02:13:51,557
Very cute.

2534
02:13:52,037 --> 02:13:53,756
Come, let me put this on for you.

2535
02:14:01,836 --> 02:14:04,797
Son, I didn't know
your training is so tough.

2536
02:14:05,676 --> 02:14:06,677
Good job, son.

2537
02:14:07,116 --> 02:14:09,117
You did it. It must be hard on you.

2538
02:14:09,837 --> 02:14:10,677
Not at all.

2539
02:14:11,477 --> 02:14:12,276
In fact,

2540
02:14:13,037 --> 02:14:14,117
it was tougher on you both.

2541
02:14:27,876 --> 02:14:29,637
You have grown up.

2542
02:14:30,957 --> 02:14:31,757
Thank you, mom.

2543
02:14:32,757 --> 02:14:33,717
Smart boy.

2544
02:14:35,877 --> 02:14:38,397
How can they do this to my baby boy?

2545
02:14:38,517 --> 02:14:40,997
Your training is so ridiculously difficult.

2546
02:14:41,517 --> 02:14:42,876
Do you want mommy to go complain?

2547
02:14:42,996 --> 02:14:43,757
Mom.

2548
02:14:43,877 --> 02:14:44,877
This is elite training.

2549
02:14:44,997 --> 02:14:47,237
Your son is an elite frogman now.

2550
02:14:47,477 --> 02:14:49,716
He is an elite frogman. Understand?

2551
02:14:50,397 --> 02:14:51,717
What is elite?

2552
02:14:52,877 --> 02:14:54,237
Like a whole truckload of durian,

2553
02:14:54,357 --> 02:14:55,437
the best one among them all.

2554
02:14:55,557 --> 02:14:56,676
That is elite.

2555
02:14:56,916 --> 02:14:57,756
Understand?

2556
02:14:57,876 --> 02:14:59,237
Grandma. It's the Elite Force.

2557
02:14:59,357 --> 02:15:00,237
Elite.

2558
02:15:01,757 --> 02:15:03,237
Elite Force.

2559
02:15:04,037 --> 02:15:05,277
What is Elite Force?

2560
02:15:06,077 --> 02:15:06,917
Grandma.

2561
02:15:07,956 --> 02:15:09,717
-So cute.
-Take photo.

2562
02:15:10,037 --> 02:15:11,997
Wait. Let me put this on first.

2563
02:15:12,957 --> 02:15:14,037
Okay.

2564
02:15:15,677 --> 02:15:18,156
-Hi Wei-ming, congratulations.
-Thank you.

2565
02:15:18,276 --> 02:15:19,757
Hi Wei-ming, we are here to support you.

2566
02:15:19,917 --> 02:15:21,117
We know that training has been tough.

2567
02:15:21,237 --> 02:15:22,476
We are very proud of you.

2568
02:15:22,797 --> 02:15:23,717
Thank you so much.

2569
02:15:29,556 --> 02:15:31,716
I didn't expect you two to come tonight.

2570
02:15:32,436 --> 02:15:33,357
Thanks for coming.

2571
02:15:34,557 --> 02:15:36,477
You are the commando in the photo.

2572
02:15:36,957 --> 02:15:37,836
What photo?

2573
02:15:39,996 --> 02:15:41,556
You told me that I couldn't find anyone

2574
02:15:41,676 --> 02:15:43,836
with a positive mindset towards NS.

2575
02:15:44,117 --> 02:15:44,877
I found one

2576
02:15:44,997 --> 02:15:45,957
and he is the one.

2577
02:15:46,917 --> 02:15:47,757
Your new boyfriend.

2578
02:15:47,916 --> 02:15:49,437
Boyfriend? Me?

2579
02:15:49,677 --> 02:15:50,556
No.

2580
02:15:51,036 --> 02:15:52,197
We are cousins.

2581
02:15:52,517 --> 02:15:53,436
Cousin.

2582
02:15:55,277 --> 02:15:57,237
You bird brain. You hear that?

2583
02:15:57,357 --> 02:15:59,316
I knew the commando brothers are dependable.

2584
02:15:59,436 --> 02:16:00,437
Brilliant.

2585
02:16:00,677 --> 02:16:01,917
You go to hell.

2586
02:16:02,637 --> 02:16:03,396
Congratulations.

2587
02:16:03,516 --> 02:16:04,317
Thanks.

2588
02:16:04,677 --> 02:16:05,477
Excellent.

2589
02:16:12,516 --> 02:16:13,317
Thank you.

2590
02:16:15,237 --> 02:16:16,437
Sir.

2591
02:16:16,877 --> 02:16:18,837
Whose record is better than No. 2?

2592
02:16:19,317 --> 02:16:21,357
I really want to know who No. 1 is.

2593
02:16:21,677 --> 02:16:22,917
He was a British naval diver.

2594
02:16:23,037 --> 02:16:24,437
He set the record in 1963.

2595
02:16:25,397 --> 02:16:27,677
What was his record compared to No. 2?

2596
02:16:27,876 --> 02:16:28,836
More than a minute?

2597
02:16:29,397 --> 02:16:30,396
Way longer than that.

2598
02:16:30,516 --> 02:16:31,596
Ever since he set the record,

2599
02:16:31,716 --> 02:16:32,637
he hasn't been up since.

2600
02:16:35,997 --> 02:16:36,876
Who?

2601
02:16:37,956 --> 02:16:38,837
Who?

2602
02:16:39,396 --> 02:16:42,396
Hooyah.

2603
02:16:42,876 --> 02:16:44,237
Stay with the programme.

2604
02:21:07,877 --> 02:21:10,077
(It should be: why do they catch our Ken?)
