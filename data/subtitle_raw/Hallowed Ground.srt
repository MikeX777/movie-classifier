1
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:36,381
- What the hell have
you done, savage?

2
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:52,569
- My daughter will see her
child with one eye only.

3
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:55,814
Your son will not
see his with two.

4
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:08,309
We could not protect our
children from violence.

5
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:10,829
We must do better.

6
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,059
- Shit.

7
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:35,801
- You have
arrived at your destination.

8
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:43,015
- Babe, we're here.

9
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:54,924
♪ Well, it's lucky
I've seen it ♪

10
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:32,202
- This looks like
your kinda place.

11
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:39,969
- Welcome, Alice, Vera.

12
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,661
- Thank you, thank you so much.

13
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:45,043
This place, it's so beautiful.

14
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:47,425
- You're kind.

15
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,428
This land has been in my
family for generations.

16
00:04:50,462 --> 00:04:52,326
It's been a blessing.

17
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:56,088
- And I understand there's a
burial mound somewhere nearby?

18
00:04:57,331 --> 00:05:00,092
- Yes, you have
entered a sacred space.

19
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,302
- It's so quiet.

20
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:07,410
- We say, listen to the silence.

21
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:08,549
Let it speak to you.

22
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:12,381
It can bring you peace.

23
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:18,283
- I'm gonna go get our bags.

24
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,977
- Then I'll give
you the grand tour.

25
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:50,419
We encourage our guests
to fish the pond.

26
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:51,558
It's fully stocked.

27
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:54,837
We only ask that you
eat what you catch

28
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:56,494
or return it to the pond.

29
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:58,150
These fish are not for mounting.

30
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,020
- She said these fish
are not for mounting.

31
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,371
- My wife, she has
the sense of humor

32
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:12,682
of an eight-year-old boy.

33
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:16,721
- Mounting, like sex.

34
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:20,483
Having sex with a fish.

35
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,729
Well, taxidermy is
such a clinical term.

36
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:25,592
- Mm-hmm.

37
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:39,813
Who's that?

38
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,471
- Oh, that's Sandy.

39
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:44,265
He's the custodian
of the property.

40
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,128
You'll see him around.

41
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:47,096
He's a little eccentric,

42
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,995
but he's been with
me for some time.

43
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,205
He's, well, he's family.

44
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:55,380
- And he lives here?

45
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:59,729
- Yes, it's always
good to have someone

46
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:00,972
keeping a watchful eye.

47
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:07,530
I encourage you to
explore these woods,

48
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:12,570
but digging is not allowed,
even for archeologists.

49
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:14,606
- Of course.

50
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:17,540
- The bones of our dead still
mingle with the soil here,

51
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:22,096
and about that fact,
we are deadly serious.

52
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:33,798
- Oh.

53
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:38,354
- You got us.

54
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:45,982
- May I?

55
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:52,092
Obsidian, it's a truth enhancer.

56
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:54,094
It's said to bring
to the surface

57
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:56,476
the purest incarnation
of oneself.

58
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:00,652
It's beautiful.

59
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:02,689
- Thank you.

60
00:08:06,624 --> 00:08:11,145
- Well, I'll leave you to enjoy.

61
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,078
You have my cell if
you need anything.

62
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:14,079
- Thank you.

63
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,845
- I'm sorry, I almost forgot,
and this is very important.

64
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:25,021
Please be mindful of
the property line.

65
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:27,886
Our neighbors are
vehemently possessive

66
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:30,440
of their land, as they call it.

67
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,927
- I assume the line
is clearly marked.

68
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:38,069
- With barbed wire.

69
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,808
- None of the reviews

70
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:54,326
mentioned the creep
factor around here.

71
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,227
Well, she wasn't that
weird on the phone.

72
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,540
And what was all that,

73
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:03,128
the bones of our dead are still
mingling with the soil crap?

74
00:09:03,163 --> 00:09:05,786
I mean, come on.

75
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:08,962
- Well, it is her belief system,

76
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:12,448
so I don't know why you have
to be so judge-y about it.

77
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:14,415
- You mean, observant.

78
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,833
- No, no, I mean judgmental.

79
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:20,145
I mean, I study these
people for a living,

80
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,561
and you're judging them.

81
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:25,047
- She had a weird energy.

82
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,842
Okay, that's what
I'm trying to say,

83
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:28,153
but that's all
I'm trying to say.

84
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:30,535
You don't have to go all
PC police on me, okay?

85
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:37,404
Hey, I don't want to
fight about stupid shit.

86
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:40,787
It's not why we're here.

87
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:42,098
- No, it's not.

88
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:51,729
- To not fighting
about stupid shit.

89
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,515
And to some more of that.

90
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:25,072
- I hope so.

91
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:41,157
- What time is it?

92
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:42,055
- Late-ish?

93
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:55,585
- Hey, do you
know what time it is?

94
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,656
- Ally.
- Hey!

95
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,898
- Ally!
- What?

96
00:10:57,933 --> 00:11:00,176
- The man works
here, give him a break.

97
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:02,903
- Well, I'm just
trying to listen to silence, V.

98
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:13,396
- I'm not disturbing
you pretty ladies, am I?

99
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:15,813
- A little bit, yeah.

100
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:19,057
- Well, I am so sorry.

101
00:11:20,403 --> 00:11:22,820
See, I got a lotta
property I gotta work on.

102
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:26,064
Much cooler at night, you know?

103
00:11:27,514 --> 00:11:31,104
Man my age gotta be mindful

104
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:35,556
of his health in
this thick heat.

105
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:37,904
That heat'll wear you out.

106
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:38,801
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:46,119
Oh, I shoulda been mindful
of y'all's privacy too.

108
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:48,259
Dang me to hell.

109
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:54,506
- It's okay.

110
00:11:57,682 --> 00:12:01,893
- So, y'all girlfriends, huh?

111
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:08,106
I mean, uh, you know, you're uh,

112
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:12,766
y'all are romantically entwined.

113
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:15,838
- That's really none
of your business.

114
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,083
- Um, we're married.

115
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:25,261
- No, I ain't got no
problem with it, nope.

116
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:29,507
I'm a, what'd they call it?

117
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:31,958
Progressive.

118
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:38,171
I have smoked
marijuana, I enjoyed it.

119
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:44,867
I believe folks
love who they love.

120
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,492
Y'all born with
it, I believe that.

121
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,463
Yeah, I believe that.

122
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:12,964
Well, I reckon I'll go

123
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:15,415
put the tractor back
up under the shed

124
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:19,419
and mosey on over to
my old trailer there.

125
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:22,146
Yes, ma'am.

126
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,701
Y'all holler if
you need anything.

127
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:29,015
I just wanted to say hidee-doo.

128
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:32,018
All right, then.

129
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:34,883
- Thank you.

130
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,092
- Yes, ma'am, my pleasure.

131
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:41,855
Nighty, night.

132
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:51,071
- Breathe, breathe,
just breathe.

133
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:56,111
- Yeah, one big creeptastic
breath.

134
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:21,930
- Shh.

135
00:14:23,932 --> 00:14:25,519
You could be on the next cover.

136
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:31,284
Take this off.

137
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,297
I told you, you weren't
getting rid of me.

138
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:53,271
We are not fucking done.

139
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:57,241
- Stop it, stop it, stop it.

140
00:16:35,132 --> 00:16:37,755
- Oh, I am so bad at this.

141
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:38,928
- No, you're not.

142
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:40,482
- Yeah, you know I am.

143
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:44,831
- Let go, just let go.

144
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:47,730
- Trying.

145
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:50,009
- Try harder.

146
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,080
♪ You love me and feel me

147
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:57,119
♪ The whole night, yeah

148
00:16:58,707 --> 00:17:00,881

- Just be with me tonight.

- I, I, I'm sorry, I, I just
don't think I'm ready, Ally.

151
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:15,275
Look, maybe soon, okay, I hope,

152
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:18,761
but just, let's
just talk tonight.

153
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:21,178
- But we can talk
while we're dancing.

154
00:17:21,212 --> 00:17:24,871
We don't have to be
10 feet apart to talk.

155
00:17:24,905 --> 00:17:28,978
We can be touching and talking.

156
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:31,084
- Ally, come on, you
know what I mean.

157
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,674
You're, you're trying
to have sex with me,

158
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,573
and you don't really wanna
just talk while we're dancing.

159
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,679
I mean, come on.

160
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,108

♪ I don't wanna hate you

162
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:57,973

♪ All over

164
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:04,393

♪ Don't want you to hate me
- Well, I'm of the opinion

that you don't have to
talk to communicate.

167
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:11,538
I wanna fuck you.

168
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:12,850
That is communication.

♪ I want to embrace you

170
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:17,544

- V, get out of your head!

172
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:23,516
Please, just be the
emotionally dialed in woman

173
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,758
that I fell in love with

174
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:27,244
and leave the neurotic
analytical intellectual

175
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:28,245
at the university.

176
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:32,628
- But that's me too.

Don't you get that?

And, and emotional?

179
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:39,842
I don't know what's more
emotional than betrayal.

180
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:42,949
And with a man.

181
00:18:44,226 --> 00:18:46,573
Do you know how fucked
up that is for--

182
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:48,886
- For what, for a lesbian?

183
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,749
But I'm not,

184
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:54,961
I have always been bi,

185
00:18:54,995 --> 00:18:57,481
every day since
the day you met me,

186
00:18:57,515 --> 00:19:00,173
when, by the way,
I was dating a man.

187
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:04,177
I am bi, whether your community

188
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:06,110
chooses to accept
such things or not.

189
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,732
- It is not about that.

190
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:09,907
- It's fucking part of
it, and you know it.

191
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:22,609
- Look, after,

192
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:27,200
after,

193
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:34,276
I became a ghost, emotionally.

194
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:38,004
- You were a ghost for a
long time before that, V.

195
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,665
- I thought I didn't
have to pretend with you,

196
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,152
to be some kind of cookie
cutter version of a romantic.

197
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,810
I thought we were
beyond this, Ally.

198
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:52,743
You now, I had my
tenure, I had my--

199
00:19:52,777 --> 00:19:55,228
- Oh, here we
fucking go, tenure.

200
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,229
Do we have to
- Yeah!

201
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:57,299
- keep talking
- Yeah, me too.

202
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:58,852
- about the university?
- Just shut up

203
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:02,408
♪ To feel alone by myself

204
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:04,410
- Just shut up.

205
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:06,135
You know what, just,

206
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:10,347
I wish for like just a minute

207
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,661
that I could make you
understand what it was like

208
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:18,320
to grow up gay in
the Bible Belt.

209
00:20:19,873 --> 00:20:21,806
You wanna talk
about bi-antagonism,

210
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:25,016
try homophobia in the South.

211
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:27,881
You know, to be made to feel

212
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,229
like you've got some
sort of disease,

213
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:33,991
like, like your cells are
twisted up on the inside

214
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,269
and that's what makes me
like girls instead of boys.

215
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:40,377
You know, I never,
ever got over that,

216
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:42,241
just this nagging feeling

217
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,315
that something was wrong
with me physically,

218
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:53,010
that, that my body
was sick in some way,

219
00:20:55,357 --> 00:20:59,188
and you know, every time
I actually allowed myself

220
00:20:59,223 --> 00:21:04,124
to be with a woman,
I felt dirty,

221
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:08,577
deep down, I felt dirty.

222
00:21:10,338 --> 00:21:12,201
But then I met you.

223
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:19,070
And the connection was
more than physical,

224
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:23,523
and for the first time, I
fell in love with a woman

225
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:25,249
for more than just her body.

226
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:28,217
I fell in love with her mind.

227
00:21:31,048 --> 00:21:32,877
And it wasn't dirty anymore.

228
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:39,021
And then that beautiful,
brilliant woman

229
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:43,750
chose a man over me.

230
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:51,137
- Because he studied,
he craved my body,

231
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,659
and I think, I know
that you used to do that

232
00:21:55,693 --> 00:21:57,350
because I felt it.

233
00:21:59,387 --> 00:22:03,667
I'm a carnal person,
V, that's who I am.

234
00:22:06,704 --> 00:22:10,121
And no amount of
talking can change that.

235
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:24,377
- You gonna answer that?

236
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:35,146
- Why me?

237
00:22:39,116 --> 00:22:41,014
- 'Cause I'm a photographer,

238
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:44,432
and you are
incredibly photogenic.

239
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:48,090
- That's not an answer.

240
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:48,919
- Sure it is.

241
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:52,025
I could ask you the same thing.

242
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,234
Why are you doing this?

243
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:56,513
- It's something different.

244
00:22:56,547 --> 00:22:59,654
My wife won't have sex
with me, and you will.

245
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,358
- Where'd you go?

246
00:23:17,603 --> 00:23:18,397
Ally?

247
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:24,368
- Fuck, no where,
I'm, I'm right here.

248
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:28,407
- You wanna talk now?

249
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,002
- I'm--

250
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:13,590
- I know, I am too.

251
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,467
Let's go for a walk.

252
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:41,618
- Here, fishy, fishy, fishy.

253
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:53,492
Here, fishy, fishy, fishy.

254
00:25:00,947 --> 00:25:01,914
Mornin'!

255
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,469
Feedin' the fish.

256
00:25:07,057 --> 00:25:09,508
How was y'all's
evenin' last night?

257
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:12,441
- Not quite what we'd hoped.

258
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:16,584
- It was great, this
is a lovely place.

259
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:19,276
- Yup.

260
00:25:20,242 --> 00:25:22,555
Y'all headed out to the mound?

261
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:25,006
- Yes.

262
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,667
- I've always been
intuitive.

263
00:25:32,807 --> 00:25:34,429
- Uh-huh.

264
00:25:34,463 --> 00:25:37,536
- Now, be mindful of
that property line now.

265
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,124
- Will do.

266
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:44,681
Come on.

267
00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:48,477
- Mm-hmm, all right then.

268
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,309
Here, fishy, fishy, fishy.

269
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:07,220
- Oh, wow.

270
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,465
Hey baby, what are all
these painted rocks?

271
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:12,812
- Oh, well, this is
still a very active shrine.

272
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:17,783
- How many people are
buried out here, do you think?

273
00:26:17,817 --> 00:26:19,129
- Could be hundreds.

274
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:20,406
- Really?

275
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,269
- Mm-hmm.

276
00:26:22,477 --> 00:26:25,031
See, when a member
of the tribe died,

277
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:26,446
they would place them

278
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:29,760
up on an elevated
platform above the mound,

279
00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:34,075
and then family and
friends would leave food,

280
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:36,733
clothing, sometimes kill
a dog or something--

281
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:38,113
- What?

282
00:26:38,148 --> 00:26:41,358
- Oh, um, the deceased's dog,

283
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:44,672
if the deceased had
a companion or a pet,

284
00:26:44,706 --> 00:26:47,433
anything that they believed
would help usher them

285
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:49,297
on their journey to
the spirit world.

286
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:53,819
And then, the body would
literally lay above the mound

287
00:26:53,853 --> 00:26:55,406
until the flesh began to rot.

288
00:26:56,304 --> 00:26:57,201
- Gross.

289
00:26:57,236 --> 00:26:58,168
- Yeah.

290
00:26:58,202 --> 00:26:59,928
Well, it gets better.

291
00:26:59,963 --> 00:27:03,483
So, the Choctaw had
what they called

292
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:06,728
, bone pickers.

293
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,837
See, they would grow the
fingernails really long

294
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:15,047
because it was their
job to scrape and clean

295
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:18,050
the decomposing
flesh from the bones,

296
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:21,916
and then burn it while
friends and family

297
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,676
sang songs of celebration.

298
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:24,712
- Celebration?

299
00:27:26,783 --> 00:27:28,267
- Well, yes.

300
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:31,373
You see, with the
flesh destroyed,

301
00:27:31,408 --> 00:27:34,204
the deceased's last
remaining tether

302
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:37,414
to the material world
would be broken,

303
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:40,175
and the spirit
could truly be free.

304
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,039
- Hmm.

305
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:44,663
- So then, they
would take the bones,

306
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:47,182
and they would place
them inside the mound

307
00:27:47,217 --> 00:27:50,082
and have a great feast with
the bone picker presiding.

308
00:27:51,428 --> 00:27:53,188
- I hope he washed
his hands first.

309
00:27:54,327 --> 00:27:55,570
- Yeah.

310
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:56,433
- Oh.

311
00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:59,885
You know, I just
don't understand

312
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,680
why anyone would
celebrate death.

313
00:28:02,784 --> 00:28:06,546
I mean, someone is dead,
what's to celebrate?

314
00:28:06,581 --> 00:28:09,066
- Well, I guess that depends
on what you think death is.

315
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:15,245
You know,

316
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,318
if you just close your eyes

317
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,011
and breathe,

318
00:28:24,772 --> 00:28:27,533
you can really feel
something in this place,

319
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:32,607
something beyond all this

320
00:28:34,022 --> 00:28:35,299
stuff.

321
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:42,928
Try.

322
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:44,930
- Oh.

323
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,358
- What's funny?

324
00:28:59,392 --> 00:29:00,600
- Oh, come--
- What's funny?

325
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:01,912
- Oh, come on, V,

326
00:29:01,947 --> 00:29:04,950
like you can really feel
something in this place.

327
00:29:04,984 --> 00:29:07,055
- All right, yeah, okay, well,

328
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,781
please don't be
disrespectful, but--

329
00:29:08,816 --> 00:29:11,094
- I'm not being disrespectful.

330
00:29:11,128 --> 00:29:13,130
- Okay, are we done?

331
00:29:14,614 --> 00:29:15,857
Okay, come one.

332
00:29:16,858 --> 00:29:18,204
Ah, you're hopeless.

333
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,274
- Can I have
one of the rocks?

334
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:20,310
- No.

335
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:35,946
- The dreaded property line.

336
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:41,469
Wonder who lives on
the other side of this.

337
00:29:41,503 --> 00:29:43,989
Probably some redneck asshole.

338
00:29:44,023 --> 00:29:45,853
All this beauty grinding
to a screeching halt

339
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:48,994
with a barbed wire fence
and a cheap Keep Out sign.

340
00:29:49,995 --> 00:29:50,823
- Hey.

341
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:52,721
- What?

342
00:29:54,137 --> 00:29:54,965
- Kiss me.

343
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:16,400
Oh my god.

344
00:30:16,435 --> 00:30:17,263
Shit.

345
00:30:28,447 --> 00:30:29,793
- What the fuck?

346
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:41,356
- You came onto our property,
and your friend's hurt.

347
00:30:41,391 --> 00:30:43,186
- Baby, that looks bad.

348
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,670
- Yeah, it's probably fine,

349
00:30:44,704 --> 00:30:47,190
but I guess I need a
tetanus shot or something.

350
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:49,675
- Didn't you see the signs?

351
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:52,920
- Is that a cat?

352
00:30:54,093 --> 00:30:57,476
- Mm-hmm, came
onto our property,

353
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,822
killed one of our chickens.

354
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:01,894
- Lonny
Barham, where you at?

355
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:02,999
Lonny Barham!

356
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:04,552
- At the property line.

357
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:06,174
We got trespassers.

358
00:31:11,731 --> 00:31:13,664
- Lonny Barham, what did you do?

359
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:15,183
- I ain't done nothin', Daddy.

360
00:31:19,636 --> 00:31:20,602
- You cut yourself?

361
00:31:22,742 --> 00:31:25,573
- Um, just on the fence, yeah.

362
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:27,886
- On the fence, on this fence?

363
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,922
- Yeah, that fence.

364
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:32,304
Do you, your kid killed a cat.

365
00:31:37,516 --> 00:31:38,897
- That the one that
ate our Dominicker hen?

366
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,036
- Mm-hmm.

367
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:42,901
- That's my boy.

368
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:44,557
That cat's been wreaking
havoc like a son of a bitch

369
00:31:44,592 --> 00:31:46,939
on our property killin'
all our chickens.

370
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,600
You know, you might
wanna wrap that up.

371
00:31:52,634 --> 00:31:53,428
- I'll be fine.

372
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:56,466
- You mighty confident.

373
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:05,130
You best go ahead and
wrap it up, there you go.

374
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:06,925
Come on, now.

375
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:10,929
Don't want it to get infected.

376
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,727
My name's Bill
Barham, this is Lonny.

377
00:32:16,762 --> 00:32:17,866
Pleased to meet y'all.

378
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:21,215
Y'all be safe now.

379
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,529
Come on, kiddo.

380
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,198
- I think we should go.

381
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:40,165
This place is off.

382
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:44,514
- Is it any more off
than anywhere else?

383
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:47,172
Just please remember why we
came here in the first place.

384
00:32:47,206 --> 00:32:49,484
- I mean, yeah, okay,
it's fucked up everywhere,

385
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,486
but at least at home,
we know the score.

386
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:54,420
- Right.

387
00:32:58,493 --> 00:33:00,633
I guess call blocking
doesn't work on your phone.

388
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,715
- Did you cross
the property line?

389
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,653
- Nita, I--

390
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:22,724
- Alice, I thought
you might like to see

391
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:24,554
the results of our latest shoot.

392
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:26,866
- I'm calling 9-1-1.

393
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:29,145
- Wait, just give
me a minute, okay?

394
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:32,941
I just wanted to talk
about what happened.

395
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:35,875
I feel we had a
misunderstanding.

396
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:39,810
- You've gotta be kidding.

397
00:33:39,845 --> 00:33:42,882
- I was just stopping by to
see how your stay was going,

398
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:44,505
and I found him here.

399
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:46,334
- Thatcher, what the
fuck are you doing?

400
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:49,579
- I called, quite a few times.

401
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:51,270
I don't know why I had the
tracker put on the car.

402
00:33:51,305 --> 00:33:52,961
I'm troubled, obviously.

403
00:33:57,104 --> 00:34:01,073
- Look, I don't know what
this is, but whatever it is,

404
00:34:01,108 --> 00:34:03,386
it's not worth you
destroying your life over,

405
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,319
which is what you're
going to do here.

406
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:11,118
- You must be Vera, the
cold fish professor.

407
00:34:17,745 --> 00:34:21,887
I have long waited to meet you.

408
00:34:26,788 --> 00:34:28,514
- Did you hear what I said?

409
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:30,654
- I think so.

410
00:34:32,415 --> 00:34:35,901
Why would I be destroying
my life?

411
00:34:35,935 --> 00:34:40,940
I'm, I'm here to make amends
with the woman I love.

412
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,910
That is a noble thing.

413
00:34:45,842 --> 00:34:47,223
Isn't that what you're doing?

414
00:34:49,535 --> 00:34:51,675
Let me ask you a question.

415
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,092
Have you ever had
sex with a camera?

416
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,027
Answer the question.

417
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:04,274
Have you ever fucked a camera?

418
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:12,248
See, you can take all the
pictures in the world,

419
00:35:13,387 --> 00:35:18,116
people, places, and
capture emotion,

420
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:22,948
a perspective, a mood,

421
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:25,433
bottle it up into celluloid,

422
00:35:25,468 --> 00:35:28,988
or nowadays, into thousands
and thousands of digital pixels

423
00:35:29,023 --> 00:35:31,715
and put 'em in this little
device called a camera.

424
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:37,583
And be celebrated and paid
handsomely for your work.

425
00:35:37,618 --> 00:35:42,623
Some might even call you
the Great Thatcher Vance,

426
00:35:44,383 --> 00:35:45,971
which of course is empowering.

427
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:50,389
But the device itself,

428
00:35:50,424 --> 00:35:54,600
the instrument of your success,

429
00:35:55,705 --> 00:35:57,465
it doesn't love you.

430
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:01,780
It's cold to the touch.

431
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:08,166
It doesn't satisfy your
basic biological needs.

432
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:17,105
Of course, you'd know something
about that, wouldn't you?

433
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,178
'Cause you sure weren't
satisfying Ally's.

434
00:36:23,388 --> 00:36:24,975
- Damn you, Thatcher.

435
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,426
- I am really tired of
being beat up by women.

436
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,536
Now, I'd like us to just
sit down and converse

437
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,816
while Alice tells me what she
thinks of our latest shoot.

438
00:36:40,715 --> 00:36:41,544
- You're insane.

439
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:44,512
- You're still wearing
the necklace I gave you.

440
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:50,311
- You said you got
that at an artisan's market.

441
00:36:53,383 --> 00:36:54,902
- Mm, really, Ally.

442
00:36:56,110 --> 00:37:00,908
These are better
than the first time.

443
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:05,292
You remember the first time.

444
00:37:12,437 --> 00:37:13,783
- I remember the last time.

445
00:37:14,991 --> 00:37:16,406
- What are you doing?

446
00:37:17,476 --> 00:37:19,409
I said, I love you.

447
00:37:22,101 --> 00:37:24,276
- Don't you ever put
your hands on me again.

448
00:37:28,763 --> 00:37:30,075
- You crazy bitch.

449
00:37:31,456 --> 00:37:33,872
It's gonna take more than
that to get rid of me though.

450
00:37:38,117 --> 00:37:38,911
So do I.

451
00:37:57,413 --> 00:37:58,793
- What is going on here?

452
00:37:58,828 --> 00:37:59,656
- Bill.

453
00:38:03,453 --> 00:38:07,146
- Now, Nita, don't
go overreacting.

454
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:10,288
We're simply responding
to a complaint.

455
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:12,773
- We just saw you.

456
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,499
- Did ya?

457
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:22,783
We're here in a formal capacity,
just so everyone's clear,

458
00:38:24,129 --> 00:38:25,993
you were caught trespassing
on Barham property,

459
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:29,686
and you were seen by a child
doing some unsavory things,

460
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:33,656
which, perhaps ought best
be left behind closed doors,

461
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,140
if done at all.

462
00:38:35,174 --> 00:38:37,591
- You mean the psycho
kid with the dead cat.

463
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:38,454
- Alice.

464
00:38:44,252 --> 00:38:45,357
- You got spirit.

465
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,877
I like that.

466
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,156
But if you wanna get
off with a warning,

467
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,296
your better keep
your mouth shut.

468
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,366
- A warning for what?

469
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:59,337
- Sir, we would like to
report an unwanted person.

470
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:02,547
- An unwanted person?

471
00:39:04,272 --> 00:39:06,205
Is that like a trespasser?

472
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,241
Like what y'all are?

473
00:39:08,415 --> 00:39:11,003
- Sir, look, this is
my ex-girlfriend--

474
00:39:11,038 --> 00:39:12,729
- You have got a lot
of fucking nerve.

475
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:14,800
- I'm here just trying to
figure some things out.

476
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:15,801
- You are not wanted here.

477
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:16,768
- I didn't ask you.

478
00:39:16,802 --> 00:39:17,700
- Hey!

479
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:19,460
- Did you fucking grab me?

480
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:21,980
- I'll do whatever
the hell I want.

481
00:39:22,014 --> 00:39:23,499
I'm gonna do a
hell of a lot worse

482
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:25,121
if you don't calm your ass down.

483
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:26,260
You understand me?

484
00:39:28,642 --> 00:39:29,470
- Yes, sir.

485
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:39,411
- Now, I don't know
what kinda weird

486
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:42,414
ungodly sexual proclivities
your degenerates

487
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:45,072
have goin' on here, but
I'm gonna tell you this--

488
00:39:45,106 --> 00:39:46,349
- Bill!

489
00:39:48,765 --> 00:39:49,732
- Uncle Sandy.

490
00:39:50,836 --> 00:39:52,838
- I got a bone to pick with you.

491
00:39:52,873 --> 00:39:53,770
- That right?

492
00:39:53,805 --> 00:39:55,462
- What you say we walk over here

493
00:39:55,496 --> 00:39:59,845
and have us a little talky talk.

494
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,227
Jerry.

495
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:03,401
What the hell's goin' on here?

496
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:04,781
- You know they crossed
the property line,

497
00:40:04,816 --> 00:40:06,818
you know what that gives
me the right to do.

498
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:09,993
- You gon'
leave these girls alone.

499
00:40:10,028 --> 00:40:14,273
- I'm gonna do what I'm want
to do.

500
00:40:15,723 --> 00:40:20,728
- Well, that's real
nice of you, Bill, Jerry.

501
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:22,178
- Y'all have a nice one.

502
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:25,699
- What was that about?

503
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:35,329
- Nita, you all right?

504
00:40:35,363 --> 00:40:37,573
- What did you tell him?

505
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:41,059
- Well, I told him the
truth, that he's an asshole.

506
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:46,996
Ladies.

507
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:49,792
Pfft.

508
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:54,969
- We're leaving.

509
00:40:55,004 --> 00:40:56,592
- I'm afraid that's
not possible.

510
00:40:57,558 --> 00:40:58,386
For any of you.

511
00:41:00,665 --> 00:41:01,700
At least not for now.

512
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:15,369
We made deals with
devils, heinous men.

513
00:41:17,026 --> 00:41:17,854
- The Barhams?

514
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:21,755
- They'd encroached on our land.

515
00:41:21,789 --> 00:41:23,204
Our little sliver of the world

516
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:26,104
seemed to recede
further each season.

517
00:41:27,692 --> 00:41:29,625
We had survived
the Trail of Tears,

518
00:41:30,971 --> 00:41:33,801
but my people had no delusions
about their security.

519
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:36,597
The mounds themselves
were threatened,

520
00:41:37,633 --> 00:41:39,704
the very soul of our people.

521
00:41:41,775 --> 00:41:45,710
After the war, their
Dark Dragon cult grew,

522
00:41:46,607 --> 00:41:48,816
fueled by fear and blood.

523
00:41:50,335 --> 00:41:53,407
Fear that they would lose the
choke hold they had on power.

524
00:41:53,441 --> 00:41:54,788
- The war?

525
00:41:54,822 --> 00:41:56,030
- Between the States.

526
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,861
- There's a cult?

527
00:42:00,448 --> 00:42:03,521
- My great-great-grandmother,
Coahoma Anoche,

528
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,352
was walking with her dog
in the woods one night

529
00:42:07,386 --> 00:42:10,907
when she stumbled onto their
land, or so they claimed.

530
00:42:12,184 --> 00:42:13,496
The line was muddy then.

531
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:19,191
One of them saw
her, used some slur.

532
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:23,575
She didn't back down.

533
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,543
She was a very powerful woman.

534
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:32,308
Coahoma means red
panther in our language,

535
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:38,486
and she was worthy of
that name, so strong,

536
00:42:40,212 --> 00:42:43,422
but her strength cost
her dearly that night.

537
00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:49,359
Three of them, sons of Curtwell
Barham, beat her horribly.

538
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:51,845
She lost an eye.

539
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:57,851
One of them raped
her, impregnated her.

540
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,993
They left her for dead
at the foot of the mound,

541
00:43:03,995 --> 00:43:04,996
killed her dog,

542
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:10,864
hung him from a
tree by his tail.

543
00:43:10,898 --> 00:43:12,141
- That's awful.

544
00:43:16,283 --> 00:43:20,459
- Her father, my
great-great-great-grandfather,

545
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:26,327
was a bone picker, Nashoba
Nawa, the walking wolf.

546
00:43:29,537 --> 00:43:31,332
He was a deeply spiritual man,

547
00:43:32,748 --> 00:43:35,751
but he lost his mind at what
they did to his daughter.

548
00:43:37,856 --> 00:43:41,101
He took his revenge on
Coahoma's attackers.

549
00:43:41,135 --> 00:43:43,206
With his great long fingernails

550
00:43:43,241 --> 00:43:45,139
he ripped their throats
from their bodies

551
00:43:45,174 --> 00:43:46,624
so they couldn't scream

552
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:49,868
as he peeled their
flesh from their bones

553
00:43:49,903 --> 00:43:52,733
and burned it in the
field behind their barn.

554
00:43:53,941 --> 00:43:58,636
But a baby with Barham
blood was to be born,

555
00:44:00,085 --> 00:44:03,157
the only thing preventing
immediate retaliation.

556
00:44:05,297 --> 00:44:09,094
When the child was born,
Old Man Curtwell Barham

557
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:11,579
approached Nashoba
with a proposition.

558
00:44:13,236 --> 00:44:16,861
If Nashoba would offer his
life freely to the Barhams,

559
00:44:18,345 --> 00:44:21,900
they would make no claim on
the child and do no violence

560
00:44:21,935 --> 00:44:25,076
to any other members
of our family or tribe.

561
00:44:28,044 --> 00:44:29,597
The slate would be wiped clean,

562
00:44:30,737 --> 00:44:34,637
provided no Choctaw
or guest thereof

563
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:39,538
ever trespassed on
Barham property again,

564
00:44:41,506 --> 00:44:46,028
for to him, that most
innocent act of Coahoma

565
00:44:47,443 --> 00:44:50,618
resulted in the
deaths of three sons.

566
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,588
Nashoba agreed.

567
00:44:56,555 --> 00:45:00,249
They hung him on a
cross, set fire to it,

568
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:05,564
and a pact was forged in blood.

569
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,808
- Why have we never
heard any of this before?

570
00:45:09,534 --> 00:45:13,987
- The slate was indeed wiped
clean, just as Curtwell Barham,

571
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,232
then Judge Curtwell
Barham, had promised.

572
00:45:19,544 --> 00:45:23,651
The story exists
now only in memory.

573
00:45:23,686 --> 00:45:26,516
- And we can't leave because?

574
00:45:28,104 --> 00:45:30,003
- The Barhams have
a claim on you now.

575
00:45:31,004 --> 00:45:35,456
You and your guest.

576
00:45:37,804 --> 00:45:39,288
According to the
rules of the pact,

577
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:42,429
they have 48 hours to decide
whether or not assert it.

578
00:45:44,672 --> 00:45:49,677
But if you leave our land,
I assure you, they will.

579
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:56,788
- What the actual fuck are
we talking about right now?

580
00:46:00,205 --> 00:46:03,208
- We're talkin' about the
spillin' of your blood,

581
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:05,970
possibly in a
particularly painful way,

582
00:46:07,178 --> 00:46:10,560
but I mighta warded
off that possibility

583
00:46:10,595 --> 00:46:12,321
if you stay where ya are

584
00:46:13,494 --> 00:46:15,945
and don't trouble the
waters any further.

585
00:46:19,846 --> 00:46:22,745
- Okay, I'm outta here.

586
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,367
Look, get outta my way, old man.

587
00:46:25,299 --> 00:46:28,924
- Name's Sandy, but you right,

588
00:46:30,373 --> 00:46:34,999
I am old, even got a little
bit of sense for all my years.

589
00:46:38,243 --> 00:46:41,695
- So, you're saying we can't
leave for at least 48 hours,

590
00:46:41,729 --> 00:46:43,559
but we may not
even be safe here?

591
00:46:44,629 --> 00:46:45,526
- That's correct.

592
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,185
But I believe this
place will protect you.

593
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,636
It has protected others.

594
00:46:53,396 --> 00:46:55,813
There are many
powerful spirits here.

595
00:46:59,126 --> 00:47:00,818
- I'll take my
chances on the road.

596
00:47:02,267 --> 00:47:05,926
- Thatcher, let's just have
drink and think this over.

597
00:48:44,887 --> 00:48:46,509
- You have done well, my son.

598
00:48:48,684 --> 00:48:52,757
To spill the blood to still
the heart of this invader,

599
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:55,967
this murderer who has
trespassed our land

600
00:48:56,002 --> 00:48:57,762
and taken what was ours.

601
00:49:00,834 --> 00:49:03,492
We protect our sacred soil

602
00:49:03,526 --> 00:49:07,116
and every living thing
that inhabits it.

603
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:11,155
Those who defile our land
become an offering in blood.

604
00:49:23,443 --> 00:49:24,962
Give me your hand.

605
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,348
Life is suffering, life is pain,

606
00:49:32,383 --> 00:49:36,076
but there is also glory on
the other side of that pain.

607
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:47,225
May your blood co-mingle
with this offering,

608
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:50,228
may it become an
offering in and of itself

609
00:49:50,263 --> 00:49:54,405
acceptable to our Master,
our Lord, the Great Dragon

610
00:49:54,439 --> 00:49:56,372
whose blood has given us life.

- Amen.

615
00:50:17,842 --> 00:50:19,292

616

tail from a tree

617

00:56:54,859 --> 00:56:55,688
What is this?

710
00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:04,593
- This is the beginning of
your purification, my friend,

711
00:57:05,732 --> 00:57:07,734
so that you may become
a living sacrifice

712
00:57:07,769 --> 00:57:10,427
acceptable to our
mighty Dragon Lord

713
00:57:11,566 --> 00:57:14,016
whose death gives
life to his chosen.

714
00:57:17,192 --> 00:57:18,676
- You can't, you can't do this.

715
00:57:18,711 --> 00:57:21,714
You, you can't, somebody,
somebody'll find out.

716
00:57:25,718 --> 00:57:29,446
- Everyone who matters in
this place stands at my side,

717
00:57:30,412 --> 00:57:32,587
and the rest cower in fear.

718
00:57:35,935 --> 00:57:36,798
- Why me, though?

719
00:57:37,937 --> 00:57:40,077
- As opposed to your
dyke friends, you mean?

720
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,461
Well, the short answer is,

721
00:57:47,049 --> 00:57:48,810
they're better
people than you are.

722
00:57:52,399 --> 00:57:54,678
You are and always have been

723
00:57:54,712 --> 00:57:59,165
a self-serving manipulative
lascivious prick

724
00:58:00,787 --> 00:58:04,860
bent and driven only
by your own lusts,

725
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:11,867
by your insatiable
carnal predilections.

726
00:58:15,008 --> 00:58:17,321
I am right about that, am I not?

727
00:58:19,565 --> 00:58:20,497
- You don't know me.

728
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:28,090
- I know many things,
but don't worry.

729
00:58:30,576 --> 00:58:32,681
Your girlfriend and her

730
00:58:36,582 --> 00:58:37,410
wife

731
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:41,518
are not out of the
woods just yet.

732
00:58:42,691 --> 00:58:44,935
- What do you mean by that?

733
00:58:48,697 --> 00:58:52,114
- You did get those bitches'
phones, did you not, Jerry?

734
00:58:52,149 --> 00:58:53,806
- Mm-hmm.

735
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,669
- Good deal.

736
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:57,154
Good deal.

737
00:59:01,089 --> 00:59:02,711
- Ooh, whoa, ooh, okay.

738
00:59:04,057 --> 00:59:05,024
Okay, ooh.

739
00:59:06,197 --> 00:59:07,854
- Do you like my saber?

740
00:59:11,064 --> 00:59:12,479
It's a family heirloom.

741
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:20,695
My great-great-great-granddaddy,
Judson Barham

742
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:24,112
wore and wielded this sword

743
00:59:24,146 --> 00:59:26,045
in the War of
Northern Aggression

744
00:59:27,598 --> 00:59:32,569
as lieutenant in Perrin's
Regiment, 11th cavalry.

745
00:59:35,192 --> 00:59:39,092
And with this sword,
he spilled the blood

746
00:59:39,127 --> 00:59:43,614
of vile Yankee
trespassers and usurpers,

747
00:59:43,649 --> 00:59:46,686
and now, all these years later,

748
00:59:48,136 --> 00:59:50,172
it will spill yours.

749
00:59:53,175 --> 00:59:55,868
Isn't that glorious?

750
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,941
Shall we get started?

751
01:00:02,771 --> 01:00:07,604
- Can we talk about this?

752
01:00:58,965 --> 01:01:00,691
You are blessed, my child.

753
01:01:03,211 --> 01:01:07,491
For blood is life and
blood must have blood.

754
01:01:09,493 --> 01:01:11,840
Tonight, you will
know the truth,

755
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:14,671
and the truth will set you free.

756
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:26,130
X marks the spot.

757
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:07,137
- Glorious night.

758
01:02:07,171 --> 01:02:08,000
- Yeah.

759
01:02:13,488 --> 01:02:15,628
- Husband.

760
01:02:15,662 --> 01:02:16,491
- Wife.

761
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,909
- I brought your wine.

762
01:02:23,084 --> 01:02:24,085
- Two glasses?

763
01:02:25,224 --> 01:02:27,744
- I, I thought I
might have a little,

764
01:02:29,435 --> 01:02:33,094
that we might celebrate together
what is to come tonight.

765
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:37,615
- That's mighty
presumptuous of you.

766
01:02:41,205 --> 01:02:42,275
- Then the shame is mine.

767
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:45,658
- But tonight

768
01:02:48,109 --> 01:02:51,698
our son will see his
first human sacrifice,

769
01:02:51,733 --> 01:02:54,701
and that indeed is
worthy of celebration,

770
01:02:54,736 --> 01:02:58,636
so by all means,
pour two glasses.

771
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:18,415
To you, Mother.

772
01:03:28,632 --> 01:03:30,565
- They must have been
inside the house.

773
01:03:32,498 --> 01:03:35,294
They were inside
the house with us.

774
01:03:35,328 --> 01:03:36,916
- What are they gonna do to him?

775
01:03:38,193 --> 01:03:39,643
What have they done?

776
01:03:39,677 --> 01:03:42,163
So much for this place
protecting us, right?

777
01:03:42,197 --> 01:03:44,475
I mean, isn't that
what she said?

778
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:48,514
- I said this place would
protect you, not him.

779
01:03:52,656 --> 01:03:56,763
The ancestors know the
character of souls.

780
01:03:58,455 --> 01:04:01,251
Tonight, your friend will die.

781
01:04:03,943 --> 01:04:06,463
Their thirst for blood
will be satiated.

782
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:10,570
This will be over,
and you'll be safe.

783
01:04:12,538 --> 01:04:14,402
It is what has to be now.

784
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,199
- We can't let that happen.

785
01:04:21,512 --> 01:04:24,895
I don't care who he is

786
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:28,795
or was to you,

787
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,145
he's still a human being.

788
01:04:39,254 --> 01:04:42,085
- Do you know where
they took him?

789
01:04:43,258 --> 01:04:45,019
- I feared you might
respond this way.

790
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:50,507
Come.

791
01:05:08,421 --> 01:05:09,353
- What is this?

792
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:12,494
- This is your only hope.

793
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:18,535
- Y'all ever shot a gun before?

794
01:05:18,569 --> 01:05:19,398
- Yeah.

795
01:05:21,262 --> 01:05:22,677
- These are the shells here.

796
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,689
I can tell y'all where
you goin' and what to do,

797
01:05:35,897 --> 01:05:38,141
but I can't help you
once you get there.

798
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:46,321
- So, if he's one of them,
why would he help us?

799
01:05:46,356 --> 01:05:48,945
- Sandy's only one
of them by blood,

800
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:52,949
and that tie is strong,
impenetrable at times,

801
01:05:52,983 --> 01:05:54,398
but his heart is good.

802
01:05:54,433 --> 01:05:56,814
- They kill people and
he allows that to happen.

803
01:05:56,849 --> 01:05:58,782
How do you call that good?

804
01:05:58,816 --> 01:06:01,992
- You don't know what
Bill Barham is capable of.

805
01:06:02,027 --> 01:06:07,032
His father, Sandy's brother,
died a relatively young man.

806
01:06:08,585 --> 01:06:10,621
Bill inherited
his position at 18

807
01:06:10,656 --> 01:06:14,280
and was drunk on power and
blood from the beginning.

808
01:06:15,454 --> 01:06:18,008
These last years would
have been far worse

809
01:06:18,043 --> 01:06:20,769
without Sandy to
mitigate the damage.

810
01:06:20,804 --> 01:06:23,565
He's more capable of doing
that from the inside.

811
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:33,334
This is as far as I go.

812
01:06:35,129 --> 01:06:37,648
I'll pray the ancestors
watch over you.

813
01:06:37,683 --> 01:06:41,514
- Come with us,
don't you want this to end?

814
01:06:41,549 --> 01:06:42,446
- Of course, I do,

815
01:06:44,655 --> 01:06:48,970
but my birthright was an
oath, sealed with blood,

816
01:06:51,697 --> 01:06:52,974
and I cannot betray that.

817
01:06:57,289 --> 01:06:59,774
If you get the chance
to kill Bill Barham,

818
01:07:00,982 --> 01:07:04,020
whatever the cost,
you must take it.

819
01:07:06,091 --> 01:07:08,024
He does not know the
meaning of mercy.

820
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,303
Do you understand?

821
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:16,860
- Yeah.

822
01:08:03,148 --> 01:08:04,010
Holy shit.

823
01:08:38,631 --> 01:08:43,636
- Behold, my husband,
my priest, my lord.

824
01:09:34,377 --> 01:09:38,519
- No, no, no, no.

825
01:09:38,553 --> 01:09:43,558
- You are blessed, you
are a living sacrifice.

826
01:09:44,732 --> 01:09:46,768
Your blood is food
for the Dragon,

827
01:09:47,873 --> 01:09:50,289
the dying and
rising Lord of all.

828
01:09:57,848 --> 01:09:59,850
Come, my son.

829
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:29,121
- Don't come after me.

830
01:10:30,847 --> 01:10:32,538
- What are you gonna do?

831
01:10:32,573 --> 01:10:35,955
- I did this, do
not come after me.

832
01:10:38,303 --> 01:10:43,273
I love you.

833
01:10:52,282 --> 01:10:53,249
- It's okay.

834
01:10:54,422 --> 01:10:55,251
Try again.

835
01:11:01,878 --> 01:11:05,364
- Let him go, take me instead.

836
01:11:12,337 --> 01:11:14,649
- And here I was gonna
let you off scot-free.

837
01:11:17,342 --> 01:11:20,552
- Do whatever you want
to me, just let him go,

838
01:11:22,036 --> 01:11:23,520
and let my wife go.

839
01:11:25,936 --> 01:11:26,868
- Whatever I want?

840
01:11:29,595 --> 01:11:33,358
That's tempting, it truly is,

841
01:11:33,392 --> 01:11:37,810
but you are standing on my
land, and for that reason alone,

842
01:11:37,845 --> 01:11:41,607
I can do whatever the hell
I want to you regardless.

843
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:01,662
You're not a killer.

844
01:12:03,905 --> 01:12:08,910
A moral reprobate maybe,
a doer of unnatural deeds,

845
01:12:10,602 --> 01:12:13,259
but not a killer, I know.

846
01:12:15,089 --> 01:12:18,230
You wanna take his
place, I can accept that.

847
01:12:19,714 --> 01:12:24,167
Give me the gun,
or you can shoot me

848
01:12:25,582 --> 01:12:29,414
and ensure that you, he,
and your pretty girlfriend

849
01:12:29,448 --> 01:12:31,243
end up strung up on a cross!

850
01:12:43,117 --> 01:12:43,945
Jerry!

851
01:12:46,776 --> 01:12:50,193
Saved by a woman, disgusting.

852
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:52,575
Untie him.

853
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:02,999
Get off my land.

854
01:13:06,485 --> 01:13:10,627
Friends, we have
new blood, take her.

855
01:13:22,294 --> 01:13:24,848
I hope you fully appreciate
what you've done.

856
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:30,095
If not, you will soon.

857
01:13:33,892 --> 01:13:34,789
- No!

858
01:13:36,998 --> 01:13:39,484
- No, damn it, Vera!

859
01:13:39,518 --> 01:13:40,381
Run, run!

860
01:13:41,831 --> 01:13:42,659
- You missed!

861
01:13:46,491 --> 01:13:47,319
Go get her.

862
01:13:48,734 --> 01:13:50,909
- No, no, that wasn't the
deal, please, leave her, no.

863
01:13:52,669 --> 01:13:53,739
Vera!

864
01:13:55,948 --> 01:13:57,502
- Wait.
- Damn it.

865
01:13:57,536 --> 01:13:59,745
God.

866
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:01,333
- We'll just take
this hero here.

867
01:14:14,208 --> 01:14:15,416
Take her to the stall.

868
01:14:30,293 --> 01:14:31,605
- Come on, get up.

869
01:14:51,072 --> 01:14:52,073
Okay.

870
01:14:55,214 --> 01:14:56,043
Okay.

871
01:14:59,874 --> 01:15:01,186
Okay, let's just.

872
01:15:04,361 --> 01:15:05,535
Shh.

873
01:15:09,021 --> 01:15:12,231
You're too heavy,
I don't know if I.

874
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:20,170
- She, she never loved me.

875
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:29,283
She never stopped lovin' you

876
01:15:31,941 --> 01:15:33,218
and that got to me.

877
01:15:35,116 --> 01:15:37,084
- Why me?

878
01:15:37,118 --> 01:15:38,603
- Because I'm a photographer,

879
01:15:38,637 --> 01:15:41,813
and you're incredibly
photogenic.

880
01:15:44,712 --> 01:15:46,093
- That's not an answer.

881
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:48,198
- Sure it is.

882
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:53,514
I could ask you the
same thing, why me?

883
01:15:54,757 --> 01:15:56,137
You're not even into dudes.

884
01:15:57,622 --> 01:16:02,109
- I used to be into guys, but
I needed something different.

885
01:16:03,869 --> 01:16:06,492
My wife won't have sex with me,

886
01:16:07,873 --> 01:16:09,841
but that doesn't mean
I don't love her.

887
01:16:11,049 --> 01:16:12,533
She's the only person

888
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,053
I could ever really see
myself loving in that way.

889
01:16:20,955 --> 01:16:23,302
But this is about one thing.

890
01:16:31,828 --> 01:16:33,623
- Okay, we gotta go.

891
01:16:33,658 --> 01:16:36,143
We gotta go, come on.

892
01:16:36,177 --> 01:16:38,766
Come on.

893
01:16:55,576 --> 01:16:57,992
- It's a big deal to
postpone the ritual,

894
01:17:02,272 --> 01:17:04,136
but for you, I'm
making an exception.

895
01:17:16,908 --> 01:17:21,913
But how to purify for the
glorious death that is to come?

896
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:27,159
With a blade?

897
01:17:34,615 --> 01:17:35,443
A whip?

898
01:17:41,726 --> 01:17:42,554
A cane.

899
01:17:46,282 --> 01:17:48,042
There are so many options.

900
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:54,497
Jerry.

901
01:17:56,326 --> 01:17:57,845
Go see about my wife and child.

902
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:08,649
You too, Winslow.

903
01:18:18,521 --> 01:18:23,491
Now that I think about it,
there is another option.

904
01:18:29,635 --> 01:18:30,464
Hell,

905
01:18:35,469 --> 01:18:39,024
it might even fix you,

906
01:18:41,475 --> 01:18:46,204
purge you of your aberrant
desire for the same sex.

907
01:18:47,619 --> 01:18:50,864
You have, of course,
been with men,

908
01:18:56,283 --> 01:18:59,527
but you have never
been with one like me.

909
01:18:59,562 --> 01:19:01,806
- You have a wife, a child.

910
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:10,780
- King Solomon had 700
wives and 300 concubines.

911
01:19:12,264 --> 01:19:14,473
You, of course, would fall
into the latter category,

912
01:19:14,508 --> 01:19:16,268
if I were to let you live,

913
01:19:19,962 --> 01:19:24,587
if I were to let her live.

914
01:19:32,215 --> 01:19:36,599
What would you say if I
offered you such a proposition?

915
01:19:40,292 --> 01:19:41,397
- If you let her live.

916
01:19:44,503 --> 01:19:45,332
- Deal.

917
01:19:59,173 --> 01:20:00,002
- Untie me.

918
01:20:32,344 --> 01:20:37,349
- I am man, superior
in every way to woman.

919
01:20:39,973 --> 01:20:42,596
Inside me lives a dragon,

920
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:50,328
and now, I shall show you
the meaning of suffering.

921
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:04,687
Get up.

922
01:21:08,449 --> 01:21:09,278
- Nita, Nita!

923
01:21:13,144 --> 01:21:13,972
Whoa.

924
01:21:15,525 --> 01:21:17,734
He's lost a lot of
blood, he needs a doctor.

925
01:21:20,151 --> 01:21:22,118
- He's lost too much
blood, I'm afraid.

926
01:21:23,706 --> 01:21:26,191
- Do something, damn it!

927
01:21:26,226 --> 01:21:29,608
How are you gonna just let these
monsters do this to people?

928
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,475
- Let me make a call.

929
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,516
- I'm sorry.

930
01:22:12,513 --> 01:22:14,791
- It doesn't take much of a man

931
01:22:14,826 --> 01:22:16,517
to torture a helpless victim.

932
01:22:21,867 --> 01:22:24,940
- Oh, you're
helpless now, are ya?

933
01:22:28,081 --> 01:22:30,083
You mean, you're to my equal.

934
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,605
Isn't that what you
feminists think?

935
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:39,333
That a woman is somehow
the same as a man?

936
01:22:43,475 --> 01:22:48,377
I would imagine that belief
is prevalent among your kind.

937
01:22:56,523 --> 01:22:59,836
You're gonna like this
better from behind.

938
01:23:10,916 --> 01:23:14,644
You know, in certain
Asian countries,

939
01:23:14,679 --> 01:23:17,509
caning is a punishment
reserved for men only.

940
01:23:19,097 --> 01:23:20,926
Since you wanna be one so badly,

941
01:23:22,549 --> 01:23:24,585
I figured it was a
good place to start.

942
01:23:33,422 --> 01:23:34,250
- Bill.

943
01:23:35,217 --> 01:23:36,632
- What?

944
01:23:36,666 --> 01:23:38,358
Can't you see I'm in
the middle of somethin'?

945
01:23:40,325 --> 01:23:41,499
- I can see that.

946
01:23:42,569 --> 01:23:45,399
You need to go see to your son.

947
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:48,264
He's all shook up about
what he's seen earlier.

948
01:23:49,127 --> 01:23:50,956
I don't think he's ready for it.

949
01:23:52,855 --> 01:23:56,238
- You presume to educate
me about my own son?

950
01:23:58,309 --> 01:24:00,242
He's got a stronger
stomach than that.

951
01:24:02,278 --> 01:24:04,453
Anyway, Jerry's
seein' about him.

952
01:24:05,937 --> 01:24:09,113
- He ain't never seen a man's
flesh fallin' from his bones.

953
01:24:11,184 --> 01:24:13,013
He ain't never been asked

954
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:16,465
to nail a human being
to a board before.

955
01:24:18,122 --> 01:24:21,056
That's a long way from
a 'possum or a cat.

956
01:24:25,646 --> 01:24:30,030
He needs his father to
help him understand better

957
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:31,100
what it all means.

958
01:24:35,035 --> 01:24:36,278
- Can you take over here?

959
01:24:40,454 --> 01:24:41,283
Can ya?

960
01:24:43,043 --> 01:24:43,837
- Yup.

961
01:24:46,943 --> 01:24:48,428
- All right, then.

962
01:24:57,747 --> 01:24:59,163
I'm gonna stick around
for the first lick

963
01:24:59,197 --> 01:25:01,579
just to make sure you're
not holding somethin' back.

964
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:11,623
Get on with it, I'm tryin'
to go see about my son.

965
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:20,943
Good, carry on.

966
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:41,550
- This is gonna
cost me, you know?

967
01:25:42,516 --> 01:25:44,000
Nita's my daughter.

968
01:25:46,313 --> 01:25:47,832
Her mama died havin' her.

969
01:25:49,454 --> 01:25:54,183
I insisted she keep her mama's
name, good Choctaw name,

970
01:25:54,218 --> 01:25:57,290
so she wouldn't be polluted
by the Barham name.

971
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:01,570
Take her away from here.

972
01:26:02,605 --> 01:26:03,572
She's got a.

973
01:26:05,574 --> 01:26:06,402
- A what?

974
01:26:07,507 --> 01:26:09,164
- Well, you best
better be goin'.

975
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,339
Go on!

976
01:26:39,953 --> 01:26:42,645
- Your technique
needs a little work.

977
01:26:56,590 --> 01:26:57,384
- Bill!

978
01:27:56,409 --> 01:28:00,275
- I always wondered what it
felt like to wear this thing.

979
01:29:13,244 --> 01:29:16,454
- Bill's gonna get
his saber back.

980
01:29:43,101 --> 01:29:44,724
- Ally!

981
01:29:44,758 --> 01:29:47,968
Oh my god, are you,
how did you even?

982
01:29:48,003 --> 01:29:49,556
Baby, are you okay?

983
01:29:49,591 --> 01:29:52,939
- I don't know, no, yes,
we don't have much time.

984
01:29:54,803 --> 01:29:58,013
Her, she's his daughter.

985
01:30:00,084 --> 01:30:01,430
- What?

986
01:30:01,465 --> 01:30:05,123
- Sandy, motherfucking
Sandy, she's his daughter, V.

987
01:30:07,194 --> 01:30:09,749
- Oh, okay, we need
to get you inside.

988
01:30:09,783 --> 01:30:12,407
- What is going on
with this fucked up

989
01:30:12,441 --> 01:30:13,925
incestuous family?
- Ally, Ally.

990
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:14,788
- What?

991
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,723
- This is Nita's family,

992
01:30:20,794 --> 01:30:24,936
and um, Thatcher didn't make it.

993
01:30:30,459 --> 01:30:32,668
And um, I tried, I'm sorry.

994
01:30:35,015 --> 01:30:36,534
- May I tend to your wound?

995
01:30:39,572 --> 01:30:41,436
- I don't know.

996
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:43,472
- Minco's a nurse.

997
01:30:48,339 --> 01:30:49,305
- Thank you.

998
01:31:10,016 --> 01:31:11,258
They're coming.

999
01:31:20,544 --> 01:31:21,441
- Get your traitorous

1000
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,305
ass down.
- Oh, goddamn.

1001
01:31:40,391 --> 01:31:44,050
- Tonight has been unexpected.

1002
01:31:47,053 --> 01:31:50,505
We have traveled from the
verge of glorious sacrifice

1003
01:31:50,539 --> 01:31:53,300
to the loss of two of our own.

1004
01:31:56,234 --> 01:31:58,789
For this, I shoulder
my share of the blame.

1005
01:32:02,068 --> 01:32:06,210
But a society that has
normalized debauchery,

1006
01:32:06,244 --> 01:32:11,215
women and men embracing unnatural
desires and inclinations,

1007
01:32:11,249 --> 01:32:13,700
this too must be
taken into account.

1008
01:32:17,428 --> 01:32:19,119
But more importantly,

1009
01:32:20,742 --> 01:32:25,747
betrayal, deep, disgraceful,

1010
01:32:26,851 --> 01:32:30,337
and familial has branded
our tribe tonight.

1011
01:32:35,066 --> 01:32:35,895
You.

1012
01:32:38,967 --> 01:32:42,384
I only kept you close, hell,
perhaps even kept you alive

1013
01:32:42,418 --> 01:32:43,937
out of respect for my father.

1014
01:32:43,972 --> 01:32:46,250
I see now that was a mistake.

1015
01:32:48,597 --> 01:32:49,425
But maybe,

1016
01:32:52,636 --> 01:32:55,466
maybe you might help me
achieve my end tonight

1017
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:58,331
before you receive
your just desserts.

1018
01:33:02,162 --> 01:33:04,233
Won't be long now, Uncle.

1019
01:33:06,063 --> 01:33:07,409
- Go to hell, Bill.

1020
01:33:10,895 --> 01:33:12,828
- Daddy, Daddy!

1021
01:33:20,698 --> 01:33:24,875
- He, he was goin' crazy,
wanted to be with his daddy.

1022
01:33:25,772 --> 01:33:27,394
- I wanna come with you!

1023
01:33:27,429 --> 01:33:28,810
I wanna see you purify them.

1024
01:33:31,053 --> 01:33:33,159
- Thought you was
all shook up earlier.

1025
01:33:33,193 --> 01:33:34,022
- I'm better now.

1026
01:33:36,887 --> 01:33:38,026
- What you think, Mama?

1027
01:33:41,236 --> 01:33:45,999
- The decision is yours,
my husband and my lord.

1028
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:17,479
- You need to learn
to control your son.

1029
01:34:19,515 --> 01:34:20,896
He ain't a man yet.

1030
01:34:20,931 --> 01:34:21,966
You understand me?

1031
01:34:23,347 --> 01:34:24,175
- Yes.

1032
01:34:26,246 --> 01:34:27,420
- You wanna come, boy?

1033
01:34:28,766 --> 01:34:31,286
See your legacy up
close and personal?

1034
01:34:33,737 --> 01:34:34,599
Come on.

1035
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:39,501
You go home, prepare.

1036
01:34:39,535 --> 01:34:42,090
I truly do not know what
is to come of tonight.

1037
01:34:50,408 --> 01:34:53,929
May the Dragon purify this
world with fire and blood

1038
01:34:53,964 --> 01:34:56,794
and may we be his instruments.

1039
01:34:56,829 --> 01:34:57,692
Give me that.

1040
01:34:59,728 --> 01:35:01,661
Get up, get your ass up.

1041
01:35:22,647 --> 01:35:26,306
- Drive as far and as fast as
you can, and don't look back.

1042
01:35:27,307 --> 01:35:28,688
- What will you do?

1043
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:30,655
- Trust the ancestors.

1044
01:35:33,831 --> 01:35:35,419
- I admire your faith.

1045
01:35:36,351 --> 01:35:37,593
- What else is there now?

1046
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,497
- I'm afraid you can't leave.

1047
01:35:45,463 --> 01:35:46,361
- What?

1048
01:35:46,395 --> 01:35:47,983
- They're here.

1049
01:35:48,018 --> 01:35:50,503
- Minco, take our
daughter away from here.

1050
01:35:50,537 --> 01:35:51,987
- I won't leave you.

1051
01:35:52,022 --> 01:35:53,678
- You must and you will.

1052
01:35:53,713 --> 01:35:56,095
I'll handle my family,
you protect ours.

1053
01:36:04,034 --> 01:36:04,862
Go out the back.

1054
01:36:34,029 --> 01:36:37,032
- Get the shotgun and the sword.

1055
01:36:42,141 --> 01:36:44,005
- You gonna regret this, nephew.

1056
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:49,424
- How in the hell you
think that's gonna happen?

1057
01:36:52,496 --> 01:36:54,015
Nita!

1058
01:36:54,049 --> 01:36:57,087
You send those depraved
murderous dykes out here

1059
01:36:57,121 --> 01:36:58,882
right now with my saber

1060
01:36:58,916 --> 01:37:02,851
or I'm gonna put a bullet in
your daddy's traitorous brain!

1061
01:37:02,886 --> 01:37:03,714
You hear me?

1062
01:37:13,137 --> 01:37:17,590
- Don't you worry about me,.

1063
01:37:17,624 --> 01:37:19,730
Don't you worry about me.

1064
01:37:20,904 --> 01:37:22,595
- You shut your
treacherous mouth!

1065
01:37:27,703 --> 01:37:31,949
Fox King, bring my pistol.

1066
01:37:45,894 --> 01:37:47,206
- I'm gonna go talk to him.

1067
01:37:48,586 --> 01:37:50,968
- You're not the one he wants.

1068
01:37:51,003 --> 01:37:51,831
I should go.

1069
01:37:53,074 --> 01:37:55,524
- If you go, I'm going with you.

1070
01:37:57,457 --> 01:38:00,081
I just got you back, I'm
not leaving your side again.

1071
01:38:07,709 --> 01:38:10,470
- I want you to pay close
attention now, Nita.

1072
01:38:21,861 --> 01:38:24,312
- Son of a bitch.

1073
01:38:24,346 --> 01:38:27,039
- Please, don't do anything

1074
01:38:27,073 --> 01:38:29,420
until I've exhausted
all options.

1075
01:38:30,732 --> 01:38:32,044
- What options?

1076
01:38:33,977 --> 01:38:36,289
- I shall not ask again, Nita.

1077
01:38:38,809 --> 01:38:39,637
- No.

1078
01:38:41,087 --> 01:38:41,916
Please.

1079
01:38:43,607 --> 01:38:44,435
Wait.

1080
01:38:46,196 --> 01:38:47,438
We can solve this.

1081
01:38:48,819 --> 01:38:51,201
- I told you how we solve it.

1082
01:38:52,478 --> 01:38:53,997
- This has to end, Bill.

1083
01:38:55,412 --> 01:38:58,898
So many of our own have
suffered, and for what end?

1084
01:39:00,624 --> 01:39:03,868
- How can you say that to
me after what Nashoba did?

1085
01:39:06,147 --> 01:39:08,321
To take our precious Barham boys

1086
01:39:08,356 --> 01:39:12,947
from their own beds on
their own sacred soil

1087
01:39:12,981 --> 01:39:16,329
and to massacre them like
hogs to the slaughter.

1088
01:39:16,364 --> 01:39:17,710
- They were not innocent,

1089
01:39:18,849 --> 01:39:20,989
and Nashoba gave
his life as surety.

1090
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:27,099
Cousin, our blood
is co-mingled now.

1091
01:39:28,652 --> 01:39:29,894
We are the same.

1092
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:35,314
And the soil, whether
here or there,

1093
01:39:38,593 --> 01:39:40,491
never belonged to
either of us anyway.

1094
01:39:42,528 --> 01:39:46,118
We have the power
to lay this to rest.

1095
01:39:46,152 --> 01:39:47,291
- I have the power!

1096
01:39:49,431 --> 01:39:51,019
The Dragon gave it to me.

1097
01:39:52,193 --> 01:39:53,677
Goodbye, Nita.

1098
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:55,334
- No!

1099
01:39:57,715 --> 01:39:58,544
No!

1100
01:40:10,659 --> 01:40:12,178
You son of a bitch.

1101
01:40:12,213 --> 01:40:13,421
You son of a bitch.

1102
01:40:14,318 --> 01:40:15,147
- Shut up.

1103
01:40:17,218 --> 01:40:19,116
I wanted you to
see your daughter

1104
01:40:19,151 --> 01:40:22,706
bathed in her own
blood before you died.

1105
01:40:28,574 --> 01:40:30,024
How does it feel?

1106
01:40:31,715 --> 01:40:35,132
You take the Dragon's
prize, he takes from you.

1107
01:40:38,963 --> 01:40:43,934
Now, maybe you understand,
actions have consequences.

1108
01:40:48,421 --> 01:40:49,215
- Wait.

1109
01:41:07,647 --> 01:41:08,476
You were right.

1110
01:41:10,857 --> 01:41:13,101
Actions do have consequences.

1111
01:41:15,207 --> 01:41:16,691
I'm to blame.

1112
01:41:16,725 --> 01:41:20,212
I manipulated Sandy because
I couldn't manipulate you.

1113
01:41:22,317 --> 01:41:24,595
I'm the one you want.

1114
01:41:24,630 --> 01:41:28,151
I'm the vile thing that
set this all in motion.

1115
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:30,601
- Yes, you are,

1116
01:41:33,190 --> 01:41:34,467
but so what?

1117
01:41:36,055 --> 01:41:39,714
You belong to me, and so
does your pretty wife.

1118
01:41:39,748 --> 01:41:40,577
- Please.

1119
01:41:43,027 --> 01:41:44,098
We made a mistake.

1120
01:41:45,961 --> 01:41:49,862
We never meant you or
your family any harm.

1121
01:41:51,519 --> 01:41:53,762
We didn't even know that
we crossed the line.

1122
01:41:56,317 --> 01:41:58,042
We only came to this place

1123
01:41:59,216 --> 01:42:03,220
because we just wanted
to find some peace and.

1124
01:42:08,570 --> 01:42:13,575
- There is no peace here,
only fire and blood.

1125
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:17,545
- I can't breathe.

1126
01:42:17,579 --> 01:42:18,373
- That's the idea.

1127
01:42:18,408 --> 01:42:19,236
- Stop!

1128
01:42:26,450 --> 01:42:27,831
- Bring me my saber.

1129
01:42:33,423 --> 01:42:38,428
Now.

1130
01:42:45,745 --> 01:42:47,920
Kneel and place
it on the ground.

1131
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:59,242
I see now it should have
been you from the beginning,

1132
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:06,525
but that's all behind
us, isn't it, Alice?

1133
01:43:08,975 --> 01:43:13,980
Know this, your wife will
suffer horribly for your sins,

1134
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:18,951
and we shall rejoice
in her suffering.

1135
01:43:27,718 --> 01:43:31,412
Watch closely, son, do
not avert your eyes.

1136
01:44:21,324 --> 01:44:23,118
- I am woman, you
son of a bitch,

1137
01:44:23,153 --> 01:44:25,880
and a fuckin' dragon
lives inside me too.

1138
01:44:59,741 --> 01:45:00,535
- Come.

1139
01:45:06,092 --> 01:45:08,302
I told you about this place.

1140
01:45:10,407 --> 01:45:13,928
- But they didn't protect
you, the ancestors.

1141
01:45:17,172 --> 01:45:18,001
- Protected you.

1142
01:45:20,693 --> 01:45:21,660
It is said

1143
01:45:24,179 --> 01:45:29,115
our , Nanishta

1144
01:45:30,945 --> 01:45:34,362
gave hearts to women
closer to its own

1145
01:45:35,915 --> 01:45:38,504
than those that it gave to men.

1146
01:45:40,403 --> 01:45:42,819
I see that in the two of you.

1147
01:46:36,804 --> 01:46:39,600
- This is over right now.

1148
01:46:40,635 --> 01:46:41,843
Y'all hear me?

1149
01:46:43,224 --> 01:46:46,745
I'm next in line, I'm
callin' a halt to it.

1150
01:46:46,779 --> 01:46:49,437
- Traitor, Lonny is the heir!

1151
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:53,234
- When he's of age, he is,
but he ain't there yet.

1152
01:46:54,615 --> 01:46:57,065
I'm the only Barham
standing here right now,

1153
01:46:57,100 --> 01:46:59,930
and I'm tellin' you, it's done.

1154
01:47:02,761 --> 01:47:04,797
I made my decision, I made it.

1155
01:47:06,627 --> 01:47:10,424
Bill didn't agree, but
he ain't around no more.

1156
01:47:13,081 --> 01:47:18,086
Barham blood must hold the
priesthood of the Dragon.

1157
01:47:21,227 --> 01:47:22,574
Ain't that the way it goes?

1158
01:47:25,749 --> 01:47:29,926
Y'all gonna leave these ladies
alone to go their own way,

1159
01:47:32,756 --> 01:47:36,104
and y'all gonna help me
clean up this god-awful mess.

1160
01:47:38,831 --> 01:47:40,695
And I know you
know a thing or two

1161
01:47:40,730 --> 01:47:44,803
about cleanin' up messes, Judge.

1162
01:47:46,494 --> 01:47:48,013
You too, Mayor.

1163
01:47:50,533 --> 01:47:52,845
Or y'all can try to kill me.

1164
01:47:55,330 --> 01:47:57,125
You can sure try.

1165
01:48:00,577 --> 01:48:03,960
But you gonna go ahead and
make a decision right now.

1166
01:48:06,859 --> 01:48:10,138
Go on.

1167
01:48:12,762 --> 01:48:14,349
- Everyone.

1168
01:49:02,363 --> 01:49:04,330
- It'll be dawn soon.

1169
01:49:04,365 --> 01:49:06,298
- Longest night of my life.

1170
01:49:07,886 --> 01:49:11,268
- Look, let's just get a motel,

1171
01:49:11,303 --> 01:49:14,375
something so we
can sleep, regroup.

1172
01:49:15,376 --> 01:49:16,791
- Yeah.

1173
01:49:16,826 --> 01:49:18,586
- Once we're far, far
away from here, obviously.

1174
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:22,728
You okay?

1175
01:49:24,592 --> 01:49:25,386
- I'll live.

1176
01:49:28,976 --> 01:49:29,804
- I love you.

1177
01:49:32,082 --> 01:49:32,911
- I love you.

1178
01:49:35,879 --> 01:49:37,329
- We're gonna make this work.

1179
01:49:52,137 --> 01:49:53,310
Let's go home.

1180
01:49:54,277 --> 01:49:55,105
- Yeah.

1181
01:50:18,508 --> 01:50:20,648
I'm sorry about Nita.

1182
01:51:24,988 --> 01:51:25,955
We slept late.

1183
01:51:30,684 --> 01:51:32,030
- Guess we were worn out.

1184
01:51:37,276 --> 01:51:38,105
- Coffee?

1185
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:40,486
- Yeah.

1186
01:51:40,521 --> 01:51:41,349
- Yeah.

1187
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:01,853
- I fixed that busted
pipe underneath the house.

1188
01:52:02,992 --> 01:52:04,856
Shouldn't have no
more problem with it.

1189
01:52:10,413 --> 01:52:12,380
I gotta go to the
other property.

1190
01:52:21,355 --> 01:52:24,979
Stella, you know it was
the right thing, don't ya?

1191
01:52:36,542 --> 01:52:38,717
Whatcha drawin' there, Lonny?

1192
01:52:51,178 --> 01:52:52,766
