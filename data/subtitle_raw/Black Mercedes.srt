00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,708

JUNE 1939

5
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:47,458
-I'm finished, can I turn it in?
-So quickly?

6
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,167
There's still 45 minutes,
maybe you want to add something?

7
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,750
No, there is no need.
I wrote everything I knew.

8
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,917
Perhaps I can check it and grade it now
unless you're in a hurry.

9
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,542
No, I'll be happy to wait.

10
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,917
Please.

11
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,208
-Give me your grade-book, please.
-Here you are.

12
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,917
-Born and raised in London?
-Born and raised.

13
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,792
-And you speak Polish so well?
-Because I'm Polish.

14
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:48,583
My father does business in London,
but my family lives in Tarnopol, Poland.

15
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:58,083
Congratulations, this is excellent.

16
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,292
-It ought to be published somewhere.
-Thank you.

17
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,417
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

18
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,667
I gave it my all.

19
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,958
Will you miss me?

20
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:49,083
I don't want to miss you.

21
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,792
-I don't want you to go.
-You know I have toâ€¦

22
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,042
but it won't take long.

23
00:04:56,917 --> 00:05:00,292
-But I will go crazy here without you.
-So stay the night.

24
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,292
No way!

25
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,667
They'd throw me out of the house.

26
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,625
They think you really only
teach me English.

27
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,708
Don't I?

28
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,583
Do you think a war is coming?

-Do you know the password?

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,917
Blumenfeld.

36
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,167
Here.

37
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,417
How much is there?

38
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,167
As agreed but you can count it.

39
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,833
No.

40
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,417
Please sign for it.

41
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:15,708
More documents, not all are
believable but you can verify it.

42
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,000
Filthy Jewish bratsâ€¦

43
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:30,500
you want potatoes, eat shit!

44
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,750
Stop! Stop!

45
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:57,208
Careful! Not so fast, young man!

46
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:58,375
Leave him alone!

47
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:04,875
Are you German?

48
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:07,083
No.

49
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,125
I'm a Pole.

50
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:15,375
-But you speak excellent German?
-Well, it happens.

51
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,500
Forgive me, but your accent intrigues me.

52
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:22,042
I truly am Polish,
although my name is Holzer.

53
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,333
I am a lawyer, my office is here.

54
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,167
Maximilian Graf von Fleckenstein.

55
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,250
It is a pleasure to meet you, counsellor.

56
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,375
I heard Saxon notes in your
excellent German pronunciation.

57
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,000
You are a linguist or have perfect pitch.

58
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,417
You're right,
my great-great-great grandfather,

59
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,292
Theodor Christian Holzer,
was from Dresden.

60
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,208
In that case, you are German.

61
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:53,000
No, Count,
I am fourth-generation Polish.

62
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,292
I must assist you.
It's just how I was raised.

63
00:09:58,292 --> 00:09:59,542
Please leave it.

64
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,833
Thank you very much.

65
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:24,042
Is the boss very busy, Mrs. Stefa?

66
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:31,125
That street vendor just bought
professor Zieleniecki's villa in Ĺ»oliborz!

67
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,292
The times we live in!

68
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:35,000
Yes, you can go in now.

69
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,792
-Coffee?
-Yes, please.

70
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:37,875
Just a moment.

71
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:42,667
Counsellor, the world has no idea
what's happening there.

72
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,583
Even people in Warsaw have no idea.

73
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:49,708
I see it with my own eyes but my mind
says: "no, that's not possible."

74
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:53,667
Diseases, starvation,
corpses on the street,

75
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,708
can you imagine,
about sixty nightclubs.

76
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:59,042
Caviar, champagne and whores.

77
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,375
So why do they sign and stamp everything?

78
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:06,417
If we get caught, we'll hang, all of us.

79
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,208
They need it for those sellers.

80
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:13,125
They show them all the papers so it's
legal and open.

81
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,958
Not in front of the Germans,
only among us.

82
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,417
That means nothing,
if we are caught,

83
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,833
the Gestapo will beat it all out of
us anyway.

84
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:25,500
But we won't get caught.
Because I'm just lucky.

85
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:29,667
Today, an SS officer saved me
from a roundup.

86
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,625
She's not here, she hasn't returned.

87
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,458
You keep coming for nothing.

88
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:49,500
She went to Tarnopol just before the war.
To be with her sick grandfather.

89
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:52,750
How can she get back
with the Russians there?

90
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,583
I don't know butâ€¦
I'll keep coming by.

91
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,000
-Maybe she'll come back.
-Her former flat is locked up.

92
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,958
Some German wanted the key but I told
him I don't have it.

93
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:06,042
Let them break in. Thieves.

94
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,083
Why do you call it her former flat?

95
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:11,500
I wish you the best, but don't
believe in miracles.

96
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,958
Mister, listen to what my wife is saying.

97
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:17,792
Don't come around, someone might see.

98
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,792
ONE YEAR LATER
NOVEMBER 16TH, 1941

99
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:35,250
-Is the egg too soft, Sir?
-No, it's exactly how I like it.

100
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:39,208
I wanted to make scrambled eggs
the way you like but your wife saidâ€¦

101
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,833
She said that soft-boiled are healthier.

102
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,083
And we don't have any butter.

103
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:54,208
Good morning.

104
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:56,542
Good morning.
How are you doing, Mr. Klamka?

105
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:01,083
Well it's about the new
registration forms, sir.

106
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:03,333
And my name is Klamocki.

107
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:06,042
Then I apologize,
I didn't know Mr. Klamocki.

108
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:11,542
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I need to go to the office,

109
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:15,500
so I'll fill it out this evening
and Cesia will bring it to you.

110
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:20,083
Fine, there's no rush,
if she brings it thenâ€¦

111
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,792
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

112
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,375
Remember that Max is coming
for coffee tomorrow?

113
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,708
-Yes.
-Good.

114
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,167
Maybe you two could bake a cake?

115
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,125
If we can get flour.

116
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,208
Thank you.

117
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:59,833
I'm leaving now. Mrs. Stefa,
you should close up and go home too.

118
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,167
It's cold in here.

119
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,042
It's past three already!

120
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,542
They should turn on the heating soon.

121
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,125
What they will use for fuel, I don't know.

122
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,500
Alright, goodbye.

123
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,125
Goodbye, sir.

124
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:21,917
Krystyna?

125
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,250
Krysia, are you here?

126
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,125
Krystyna!

127
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:37,958
Cesia.

128
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,000
Hello, police station?

129
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,958
Inspector RafaĹ‚ KrĂłl. Did you call us?

130
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:22,542
Yes, Karol Holzer, attorney.

131
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,375
The victim is here.

132
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,542
Who was she?

133
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,083
She was my wife.

134
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:50,333
I found her like this when I returned
from work.

135
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,417
And I called the station immediately.

136
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:58,333
She was killed about two or three hours
before your return.

137
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,583
Rigor mortis has set in already.
Was she alone?

138
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,125
No, she was with the maid,
but when I came

139
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,417
home, Cesia was not here.

140
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,792
I got here at half past three as
usual, for dinner.

141
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:16,542
To prepare dinner for half past three
one needs to start cooking no later

142
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,083
than between 12 and 1 o'clock.

143
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:23,625
So she was murdered around noon as
indicated by rigor mortis.

144
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:29,792
Our maid always
cleans the apartment, then goes shopping

145
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:33,042
and later starts cooking dinner.

146
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,875
The groceries are here,
the place is cleanedâ€¦

147
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,500
No signs of cooking.

148
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,208
Where did she sleep?

149
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,667
Here, it's the maid's room.

150
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,458
Suitcase,

151
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,417
her clothes are here as well.

152
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,417
What was her name and how old was she?

153
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,458
The blade entered precisely
beneath the shoulder blade.

154
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:28,042
And punctured the heart,
hence such hemorrhaging.

155
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,375
This indicates that the perpetrator
knew his stuff.

156
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,917
Nice looking lady, pity.

157
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,250
But will she go to heaven?

158
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,250
She probably wasn't baptized.

159
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,292
Broken middle finger of the right hand.

160
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,292
Probably no rape occurred.

161
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,458
We won't need to check.

162
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,125
A beautiful woman.

163
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,125
Anything missing from the apartment?

164
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,500
Money, jewelry, documentsâ€¦

165
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,125
Nothing's been touched.

166
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,083
Do you have a building supervisor here?

167
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:18,167
Yes, he lives in the outbuilding.

168
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,875
Why are you banging on the door
you fucking lout?!

169
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:32,542
Klamka, good to see you.
Weren't you in prison?

170
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,500
Mr. Inspector?

171
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,208
Please, please come in.

172
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:45,958
They let us out from Rawicz
on September 2nd. I have the certificate!

173
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,917
Everybody was yelling:
"hooray for the war!", but not me.

174
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,750
I'd have preferred to do my time.

175
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,333
I only had a year to go.

176
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:03,000
Mr. Inspector, I didn't kill her.
On my honor.

177
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,375
Klamka, let's not talk about honor here.

178
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,333
Who didn't you kill?

179
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,208
That attorney's wife,
from the second floor.

180
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,000
Mrs. Holzer?

181
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,458
She was murdered? How do you know that?

182
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:24,625
Inspector, sir, please don't toy with me.

183
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,833
I confess, I saw her

184
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,167
lying on the floor
with a knife in her back.

185
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:35,125
So you were in the apartment?
You broke in.

186
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,708
God forbid! I was sweeping the stairs,

187
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:42,500
because my whore wife, says that her
back hurts, but she goes to church anyway!

188
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:47,000
Calm down, or I'll give you a beating,
you'll be hurting until New Year's.

189
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:49,917
Tell me what happened!

190
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,292
Well, I was sweeping the stairs
and I saw that

191
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:58,042
on the second floor, at the lawyer's,
the door is ajar.

192
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,167
I thought that Cesia
was taking out rubbish.

193
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,292
Well, I stuck my head in the open door

194
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,917
and I shouted: "Cesia".
But there was silence.

195
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:09,875
Then I shout: "Mrs. Holzer!".
Again silence.

196
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:17,875
So, I thought I should go in because
something must have happened.

197
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:22,250
-Where did you go first?
-To the kitchen.

198
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,083
And I saw her right away,

199
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:27,917
she was lying face down, the knife
sticking out from her back.

200
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,375
I thought she was still alive,

201
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,083
because her eyes were open,

202
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,583
but then I saw that there was
nothing in those eyes anymore.

203
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,375
And then something tempted me.

204
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:47,750
I could not resist.

205
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:50,042
What did you do?

206
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,208
Talk, you pig, what did you do to her?

207
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:56,458
No, it's not what you think Inspectorâ€¦

208
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,458
I just took it off her finger.

209
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:04,875
Because I could not stop myself,
Inspector,

210
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,000
because there's a
voice in my head.

211
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,875
It makes me.

212
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,292
Shut the fuck up, Klamka!

213
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:16,958
You killed her to rob her!

214
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:23,375
I'm arresting you on charges of murder.
And this, this is material evidence.

215
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:27,958
No, Inspector.
Sir, I stole a lot in my life.

216
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:30,375
But I never killed anyone. Anyone.

217
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,958
-Fine, fine.
-No oneâ€¦

218
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,833
Well, you'll confess to the Gestapo.

219
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:37,250
When they beat your mug
into steak tartar.

220
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,875
-Mr. Inspector, Sirâ€¦
-Well, unlessâ€¦

221
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,708
Unless we have a talkâ€¦

222
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:19,833
-Sir, good morning.
-Good morning, Mrs. Stefa.

223
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:22,708
A plainclothes officer was here
a moment ago.

224
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:26,000
He was asking about you,
about what time you left yesterday.

225
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:29,333
-And if it was at the usual time.
-And what did you tell him?

226
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:31,000
That, as usual, after three.

227
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,208
And he asked if you weren't
an ethnic German, <i>Volksdeutsche</i>,

228
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:35,542
because of the nameâ€¦

229
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:36,542
And?

230
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:40,708
I said that my maiden name is
de Champois and I am Polish.

231
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:44,208
He must be <i>Volksdeutsch</i> himself,
if he's in the "blue police."

232
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:48,042
Listen please,
something terrible has happened.

233
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:53,667
Yesterday there was a crime
at my apartment,

234
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,167
a murder.

235
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,750
Jesus and Mary!

236
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:01,458
Someone murdered
my former student, a Jew.

237
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:03,375
With a knife, in the backâ€¦

238
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:07,375
I was hiding her at my place
using my wife's papers.

239
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:08,833
For how long?

240
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,708
I know, she's been here before, right?

241
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:21,750
Yes.

242
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,750
That's why the policeman came by.

243
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:27,667
He was checking my alibi.

244
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,708
I immediately called the police.

245
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,125
Are there any suspects?

246
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:36,208
Cesia, our maid, has disappeared.

247
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:40,583
Cesia? How would Cesia
be capable of something like that?

248
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:43,667
With a knife?
Where would Cesia get a knife?

249
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,375
Where? From the kitchen.

250
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,542
I'll make you some tea.

251
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:53,958
Mr. Grodecki, you will go to the Major?

252
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:57,167
Tell him what happened. Let him decide.

253
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,917
Fine, but I think that for
as long as we can,

254
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:02,958
let's behave as always.

255
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,625
Come in!

256
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,875
Good morning, sir. Inspector.

257
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,125
Well, what is it, Klamka?

258
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,125
I don't know if it matters.

259
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:25,875
This old count lives in our building.
He stops me in the hall and asks:

260
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:31,542
"Mr. Klamocki, what happened
at the lawyer's place? The police came."

261
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:32,583
So what?

262
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:37,375
So I said it was none pf my business,
but he was more insistent than ever.

263
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:43,083
And before he was too proud
to give me the time of day.

264
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,792
I think that you should interrogate him.

265
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:51,042
Klamka, you better not think what
I should and shouldn't do.

266
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,250
Nothing else? Nobody hanging around?

267
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:59,625
No, no. Some time ago,
a young man was loitering

268
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:03,083
in the doorways across the street.

269
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,167
But it was a long time ago.

270
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:06,875
Fine.

271
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:12,167
-What is the name of this count?
-Przewiedzki.

272
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,875
Unbelievable!

273
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,208
Really unbelievable, Inspector.

274
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,708
The times we live in!

275
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:28,625
Whores are reading Pascal.

276
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:36,958
Once, she would have have left behind
a Pitigrilli or something similar.

277
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:41,208
And now, does she think she will
impress me?

278
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:42,708
Sugar? Milk?

279
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,875
No, thank you.

280
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:48,667
Count, did you ever meet Mrs. Holzer?

281
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:53,417
Yes, indeed. Once, briefly on the stairs.

282
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:57,167
What impression did she make on you?

283
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:03,417
Well, a beautiful woman. Well-bred.

284
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,250
I think also in the modern meaning.

285
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,625
Meaning?

286
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:12,417
She had a slight accent,
as if she was not Polish.

287
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:15,458
Do you mean to say she was Jewish?

288
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:18,167
Possible,
but that's not what I meant.

289
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,583
-So maybe she was German?
-Maybe. Like Holzer the attorney.

290
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,625
Is he German?

291
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:29,875
Well, the surname is certainly not Polish.
Besides, he entertains Germans.

292
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:33,167
Very often an SS officer visits them.

293
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,833
Is it noticeable?

294
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:38,167
Oh, you know,

295
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,833
what does an old
bachelor have to do these days?

296
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:45,417
There is nowhere to go,
sometimes he gets whores,

297
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,125
but he is bored all the time,
so he spies on his neighbors.

298
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:52,167
Through a telescope?

299
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:54,125
I beg your pardon?

300
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:59,167
You have a telescope on the balcony,
Count.

301
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:01,417
How did you see it?

302
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,167
I noticed a flash when I was
examining the body.

303
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,125
So, maybe you saw the murderer?

304
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,792
No, Inspector,
I swear I didn't see anything.

305
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:13,750
Here, I'll show you, nothing can be
seen from there.

306
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,000
Please. Come along.

307
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:22,042
Inspector, patience is
the primary virtue of a hunter.

308
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,750
I've spent many days in the hunting box

309
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:29,375
so I could shoot a trophy mountain goat,

310
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:31,500
but I waited and waited patiently.

311
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:33,583
And for what?

312
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:37,167
Once, while on duty here,

313
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:44,333
my eye to the telescope,
and suddenly I see that

314
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:47,292
the milk set on the stove
begins to boil,

315
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,292
that it will boil over in a moment,

316
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:53,292
and then she runs into my field of vision,

317
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:58,083
Mrs. Holzer, naked as the day God
made her,

318
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:02,375
and at the last moment she removes
the pot from the stove

319
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,583
built like a goddess, wonderful,

320
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:10,375
you can see that the breasts are firm,

321
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:15,625
the hips divine, long legs
as if finely turned.

322
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,250
Simply a miracle.

323
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:25,125
She must have been in the bathroom
and remembered about the milk.

324
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,125
But this is not the end.

325
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,250
Imagine that something

326
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:34,625
falls to the floor, a teaspoon perhaps?

327
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:38,458
She leans down to pick it up,

328
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:43,167
she presents her divine <i>derriĂ¨re</i> to me,

329
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:47,167
and what do I see? That wonderful place,

330
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:51,000
this corner of paradise, this treasure,

331
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:55,917
for which we would go
to the ends of the world,

332
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,375
that narrowed eye of providence,

333
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:01,542
the heart of all and final matters,

334
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:05,042
her triumphant cunny!

335
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:09,542
She, as we used to say
in my childhood,

336
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:13,333
just shot me with her bottom.

337
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:16,792
Then I went mad, I was crazy about her.

338
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,083
I decided to get closer to her somehowâ€¦

339
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,292
Close enough to stab her
with the knife?

340
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:25,292
Excuse me?

341
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:29,417
Did you kill her, Count?

342
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,542
Say what?

343
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,000
Kill her?

344
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:48,958
All powerful, eternal God,

345
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:54,250
because it is not Thy will that
anyone of the meek be lost,

346
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:58,500
but You gave Your only Son
for the salvation

347
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:01,708
of the lost and through Him you gaveâ€¦

348
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:03,833
Give me the fifty.

349
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:11,875
â€¦against all ambushes and dangers,
by Jesus Christ.

350
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:13,292
Amen.

351
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:54,750
I'll make you pay for all of this.

352
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,792
Give it here. Give me the grenade.

353
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:11,708
-No!
-I will shoot you before you throw it.

354
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:15,458
-Then we will both die!
-But they will survive.

355
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,333
Two instead of seven. It's worth it.

356
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:21,542
Give it to me!

357
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,250
Maybe I will hold it
and you will put the pin in?

358
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:32,583
You ever see two guys thread a needle?

359
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:46,417
Catch!

360
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:50,250
Cadet Vulture.

361
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:53,500
What is this?

362
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:54,875
A grenade.

363
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:58,125
Answer like a soldier, not like a cunt!

364
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,708
Defense grenade, type O, model 33.

365
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:04,500
-The so-called "pineapple".
-"Pineapple"!

366
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:08,208
Do you know this one:
"Dad bought three bananas,

367
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:11,917
ate them all and flipped us off"?

368
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,042
And you, cadet, you flipped off
the regulations, the dignity of a soldier,

369
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:20,125
of the Home Army and common sense!

370
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:23,667
What did you want to achieve?
Who did you want to kill? That German?

371
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,250
Or the Poles present,
including the pastor?

372
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:33,083
Thank you for coming.

373
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:34,875
How could I not?

374
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,958
A friend in need is a friend indeed!

375
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:50,458
You had a lecture on the power
of a defensive grenade,

376
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:52,542
it would have been a massacre,

377
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,375
there would be no one left alive.

378
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,750
Including the two of us.

379
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,458
I did not have any other weapon,
and I found the grenade,

380
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:02,292
in September at the cemetery,

381
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:06,125
and I wanted to kill
the SS officer and the lawyer.

382
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,583
I wanted to punish themâ€¦

383
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,125
Punish them? For what?

384
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,083
For Aneta's death.
She died because of them!

385
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:20,917
Cadet Vulture!
Before the war, in my regiment,

386
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,875
for such tomfoolery you would scrub
the latrines for a month.

387
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:29,917
And today, what can I do to you?
Dismissed!

388
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,042
I'm sorry.

389
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:42,958
You know, he is my Godson.

390
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,667
In fact a good boy,
but his generation was raised

391
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,792
reading Polish romantics, Conradâ€¦

392
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:54,875
But I will come up with a punishment.

393
00:33:57,208 --> 00:34:01,542
I apologize to you too, because
I also took you for a <i>Volksdeutsch</i>,

394
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:05,542
but I could not know that
you were the Major's man.

395
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:06,708
Althoughâ€¦

396
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:11,125
I had a vague impression that
I know you from somewhereâ€¦

397
00:34:12,292 --> 00:34:13,917
I also had such an impression.

398
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:17,042
Maybe we met at some trial in the past.

399
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:19,625
That's it then!

400
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:23,917
You were at the Gorgonowa trial.

401
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,125
You were called in as an expert witness.

402
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:29,833
I took part in dozens of trials,

403
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:32,167
but that one really
caused me some trouble.

404
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:36,500
I became recognizable,
and you know, in my jobâ€¦

405
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:38,792
Yes.

406
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,458
I'm very sorry, Mr. RafaĹ‚.

407
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:47,375
It seems that I will have to tell you
everything from the beginning.

408
00:34:49,417 --> 00:34:52,958
Aneta was not my wife, she was my
student before the war.

409
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:55,375
The best student
at the School of Economics.

410
00:34:57,292 --> 00:34:59,000
I hid her at my place.

411
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:05,333
She had a rich father in London,
but she came to study in Poland,

412
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,792
because her father wished it.

413
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:11,917
He came from PodwoĹ‚oczysk
near Tarnopol,

414
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,375
where Aneta's grandfather was a rabbi.

415
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:18,667
The family's patriarch
was nearing death

416
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,542
and called the family to his side.

417
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:23,750
But the Germans beat him to it,
then the Soviets.

418
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,417
The whole family was killed, except Aneta.

419
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:32,125
When the German-Soviet front
moved east,

420
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:33,875
Aneta moved to Warsaw.

421
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,583
SEPTEMBER, 1941

422
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:52,042
Jesus Christ!

423
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,083
Miss Aneta is alive?

424
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:59,542
-Did you escape from the ghetto, Miss?
-No, I was never there.

425
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,917
So you're not Jewish, Miss?

426
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:07,417
Where will you go now?

427
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,833
The Krauts took over your apartment.
Do you have any relatives, Miss?

428
00:36:11,917 --> 00:36:14,750
No, not here. I do in England.

429
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,042
So you're English.

430
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:21,042
We've always thought you a little odd,
Miss.

431
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:23,917
A boy came by here
looking for you, Miss.

432
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,125
Young, handsome, asking about you.

433
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:28,667
Came by often, maybe for a year or longer.

434
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,042
He was here.

435
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:35,708
Well! Come in, Miss. Spend the night.

436
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,792
Tomorrow we'll find a place.

437
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:40,458
My old man knows a lot of people.
Come in, Miss.

438
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,625
Jesus, I'm sorry.
I just wanted some water.

439
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,125
Heartburn is killing me.

440
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:29,042
Take some soda
at the end of the knife.

441
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,583
It's in the cup on the sideboard.

442
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:41,583
I will go see my aunt in BrĂłdno,

443
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:45,708
She might find a job for you,
and a safe place.

444
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:49,167
You can't stay here,
too many Krauts live here.

445
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,208
Thank you very much.

446
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:57,333
So, don't let anyone in,
do not go out anywhere.

447
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:02,583
My old man gets home
from work after two.

448
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:09,083
And one more thing, if he gets a seizure,

449
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:12,917
put something hard between his teeth.

450
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,208
He's an epileptic!

451
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:24,417
But don't tell anyone, Miss,
or they'll fire him from the tram company.

452
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,500
It's scary to think what would happen
if he had a seizure

453
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:29,208
behind the wheelâ€¦

454
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,167
That would be something.

455
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,417
Well, I'm off.

456
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:04,042
At the beginning of October,
Aneta Landau came to my office.

457
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:09,167
Sir, a young woman is here.
She says she was a student of yours.

458
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:10,792
Show her in.

459
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:12,833
Come in.

460
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,792
I don't know you remember me, professor.

461
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,625
Of course I remember.

462
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:32,042
Professor, I need your help.

463
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,917
She had nowhere to go.

464
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,083
She felt threatened by these people.

465
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:41,083
A building full of Germans,

466
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:43,167
the caretaker clearly
reluctant to help.

467
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:45,750
How long did you stay there?

468
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,083
I stayed with them since Tuesday.

469
00:39:51,042 --> 00:39:52,458
But I've already decided.

470
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,458
If you do not help me,
I will go to the ghetto.

471
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:58,917
Out of the question.
You have no idea what it's like thereâ€¦

472
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,625
For you the most important
thing is a new identity.

473
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:03,458
So-called Aryan papers,

474
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:07,500
and then a safe place
and some income.

475
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:10,500
I still have some valuables.
I can also work.

476
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:13,375
I can give English lessons.
I can do anythingâ€¦

477
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,333
Excuse me.

478
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:27,042
Here you are.

479
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,875
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

480
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,083
Thank you.

481
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,042
I might have an idea,

482
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,958
but I don't know if you'd agree.

483
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:57,917
You would have to become
Krystyna Kawecka,

484
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:00,750
and this would be
your baptism certificate.

485
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:06,292
Krystyna Maria Kaweckaâ€¦ Born onâ€¦
Who is this?

486
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:08,750
It was my wife.

487
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:14,042
-Was?
-Cesia never saw Krystyna.

488
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:16,708
Besides, nobody has seen her here.

489
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:20,125
Because it was supposed
to be my surprise,

490
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:25,208
she was to see this apartment
after returning from vacation.

491
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:28,625
When we came back
from a cruise to Finland,

492
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:31,500
I came to Warsaw,
to get the flat ready.

493
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:34,667
And she was still in Jastarnia
with her father,

494
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:39,083
and when the war broke out,
they fled by plane to Sweden.

495
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:43,667
And Cesia served my mother,

496
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,542
she stayed with her until the end,

497
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:47,875
so I hired her out of pity.

498
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:53,750
It's raining, at least
we do not have to wait until it's dark.

499
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,333
You're right, professor.

500
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:57,375
Don't call me professor from now on.

501
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:02,583
And don't you forget it!
You must call me Karol. Understand?

502
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:03,542
Karol!

503
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:06,083
You will have to come alone.

504
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:10,083
We will have to pretend to have
a happy reunion.

505
00:42:10,167 --> 00:42:14,625
Then a bath, dinner,
and a shared bedroomâ€¦ Unfortunately.

506
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:20,750
But do not worry, there are two beds.

507
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:24,417
I understand everything. Karol.

508
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:32,000
Lwowska Street 3!

509
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:51,125
Come in. Now take the stairs to the attic.

510
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:53,375
Wait there for ten minutes.

511
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:56,708
And then go down to the second floor,
across the hall.

512
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:58,375
And remember, you're Krystyna.

513
00:44:06,917 --> 00:44:07,792
Krystyna?

514
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:09,417
Karol!

515
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:15,500
You're back!

516
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:45,750
When we are alone,

517
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,458
should we still be on a first name basis?

518
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:51,417
We have to get used to it.

519
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:53,708
Krystyna.

520
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:00,958
Did you call your wife Krystyna?

521
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,875
I would not dare otherwise.

522
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,833
Good night, Karol.

523
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:22,708
Goodnight, Krystyna.

524
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,792
Good morning.

525
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:36,167
Maxi, you're back at last!

526
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:38,000
Yes.

527
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:42,667
I was in such a hurry
that I neglected to go home to change.

528
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,458
-Welcome.
-Where is our beautiful Krystyna?

529
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:48,958
Well, she probably heard you come in
and is powdering her nose.

530
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:51,875
She is not, she doesn't need to.

531
00:46:52,542 --> 00:46:54,875
How wonderful, I just baked a cake.

532
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:56,667
-Thank you.
-Please, sit down.

533
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:01,250
I still have a meeting at Szucha Street,
but I wanted to drop by,

534
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:03,708
with a little something.

535
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:11,250
Caviar? Really?

536
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,708
-Coffeeâ€¦
-Brazilianâ€¦

537
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,292
Well, thank you very much.

538
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:21,250
A piece of <i>Sichertorte</i>â€¦

539
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:23,958
You were at Sicher's!

540
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:27,875
-And are the beautiful ladies still there?
-You know, husbands away at warâ€¦

541
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,333
But Vienna, carefree as always,

542
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,250
they play Strauss in the cafes.

543
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:40,167
And most importantly:

544
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:42,667
Martel.

545
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:46,125
Cordon Bleu?
Well, thank you very much.

546
00:47:47,042 --> 00:47:48,625
Hail the black market!

547
00:48:03,667 --> 00:48:06,875
For God's sake, finish already!
I have a splitting headache!

548
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:11,542
And you think I don't, Madam?
I didn't buy this contraption.

549
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:13,542
Go get some painkillers.

550
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:15,458
The ones with the rooster are best.

551
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:17,458
Do you hear me? Cesia!

552
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,417
Chop-chop!

553
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:29,250
In my previous employ,
carpets were properly beaten.

554
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:31,500
And not cleaned with some stupid machine!

555
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:34,917
I'm going to go mad.

556
00:49:44,792 --> 00:49:47,542
Stefan, it's her! Her!

557
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:52,250
As God is my witness, it's her!
I looked for her for two years.

558
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:53,583
Understand?

559
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:55,708
I was going crazy for two years!

560
00:49:58,583 --> 00:50:02,542
And she did not look for you,
but she could.

561
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,583
Give yourself a break.
Be happy that she is alive.

562
00:50:07,667 --> 00:50:10,583
She does.
She lives with professor Holzer.

563
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:13,417
Now I'm sure he is a <i>Volksdeutsch</i>.

564
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:17,042
-Maybe this is the price.
-Of what?

565
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:21,125
-That she didn't have to go to the ghetto.
-And the SS officer?

566
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:22,792
Like her best friend!

567
00:50:22,875 --> 00:50:26,833
Four days I stood on Lwowska street,
he visited three times. For what?

568
00:50:26,917 --> 00:50:27,875
For what?

569
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:31,042
Holzer wasn't home.

570
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,083
Four days? Jedrek!

571
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,250
A policeman could have seen you.

572
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:43,667
You would tell them everything! They'd
arrest us all because of your foolery!

573
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,917
It's not foolery. I won't let this go.

574
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:50,750
Stefan, lend me the Vis, will you?

575
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:53,458
I have to finish this as soon as possible!

576
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:56,583
You want my gun?

577
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:01,042
You've gone completely mad.

578
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:09,167
-Hello?
-Karol?

579
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:12,000
This is Max, hello!

580
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:13,333
Maxi!

581
00:51:14,292 --> 00:51:17,750
You disappeared again.
You were supposed to come to dinner.

582
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:20,458
Your dessert is still waiting, untouched.

583
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:23,583
Forgive me, too much work.

584
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:27,750
Today I decided to relax a little,
let's go have some fun, what do you say?

585
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:30,208
Where? Adria again?

586
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:34,000
No. You'll see. It's a surprise.

587
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:38,333
I'll pick you up after eight! <i>Ciao</i>!

588
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,875
And what of it?

589
00:52:06,417 --> 00:52:07,542
I'm scared.

590
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:13,917
Be careful.

591
00:52:25,667 --> 00:52:28,417
Krystyna apologizes,
she has a migraine unfortunately.

592
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:31,833
Oh, what a pity! I am sorry.
But not to worryâ€¦

593
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,292
We'll have some manly fun.

594
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:41,542
-<i>Halt!</i>
-But this is the ghetto!

595
00:52:42,042 --> 00:52:44,167
Your papers please. Thank you.

596
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,333
Where are you going?

597
00:52:45,917 --> 00:52:48,500
Leszno Street, number 22.

598
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:50,083
Yes, sir. Captain!

599
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,083
You have at least two hours, Hans.
You can go to a brothel.

600
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:08,583
Fit for every budget.

601
00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:12,375
I can't get infected, Captain.
I have a young wife.

602
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:14,000
Besides, I'm very religious.

603
00:53:22,542 --> 00:53:24,042
Please follow me, gentlemen.

604
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:02,875
-What champagne do you have?
-Heidsieck,

605
00:54:03,417 --> 00:54:07,125
Mumm and Veuve Clicqot, 1929.

606
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:10,708
We'll take Mumm. And salted almonds.

607
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:19,250
I was told about it,
but I didn't believe it.

608
00:54:21,042 --> 00:54:22,500
Where do they get it from?

609
00:54:40,167 --> 00:54:43,792
Ladies and gentlemen,
and now a great surprise.

610
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:46,875
Our star, Madame Magnez, will perform

611
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:50,625
the famous Petersburski,
Friedwald and Brodower hit:

612
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:52,708
"Thisâ€¦

613
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:55,917
is the last Sunday."

614
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,292
I know her.

615
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:17,250
She was very popular before the war.

616
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:21,625
Before the war, I listened to her records.
We came to see her tonight.

617
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:23,167
But Brodower is still alive?

618
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:29,125
I didn't know you were such
a music lover!

619
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:32,250
You do not know much about me yet.

620
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:54,875
<i>Now is not the time for excuses
the fact is, it's over,</i>

621
00:55:55,417 --> 00:55:59,750
<i>today another came,
richer and better than I</i>

622
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:03,625
<i>and along with you
stole my happiness.</i>

623
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:07,583
<i>I have but one request,
perhaps the last,</i>

624
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:09,750
<i>the first in many years,</i>

625
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:12,750
<i>give me this one Sunday,</i>

626
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:17,875
<i>the last Sunday,
then the world may end.</i>

627
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:25,083
<i>This is the last Sunday,
today we will part ways,</i>

628
00:56:25,167 --> 00:56:31,292
<i>today we will separate,
for all times.</i>

629
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:40,083
<i>This is the last Sunday,
so save it for me,</i>

630
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:46,292
<i>look tenderly at me
for the last time.</i>

631
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:49,500
Excuse me, I'll be back in a minute.

632
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:54,125
<i>You shall have enough
of such Sundays,</i>

633
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:01,333
<i>and what will become of me,
who knowsâ€¦</i>

634
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:09,750
<i>This is the last Sunday,
the dreams I've dreamt,</i>

635
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:16,042
<i>the happiness so yearned
for has ended.</i>

636
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:20,000
Are you the attorney?

637
00:57:20,917 --> 00:57:21,833
Yes.

638
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,167
You don't know me,
but I know who you are.

639
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:30,042
I work with Grodecki.
We did not know you would come here.

640
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:33,917
-Neither did I.
-Who is your companion?

641
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:36,833
-An officer of the SS.
-What?

642
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:41,167
Don't be upset. He brought me here.

643
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,583
As a surprise.

644
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:46,375
-I do not understand anythingâ€¦
-It doesn't matter.

645
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:48,875
Grodecki knows
everything, he'll explain.

646
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:53,458
<i>This is the last Sundayâ€¦</i>

647
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:58,333
<i>today we will part waysâ€¦</i>

648
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:02,958
<i>today we will partâ€¦</i>

649
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:07,250
<i>for all time.</i>

650
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:11,917
<i>This is the last Sundayâ€¦</i>

651
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:16,167
Beautiful music, but I don't
understand the lyrics.

652
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:19,833
If you understood, you would weep.

653
00:58:35,042 --> 00:58:39,083
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to the curfew,

654
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:42,000
we wish you a safe return home.

655
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:50,917
Are you closing?

656
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,083
No, we're open until eleven
for those who have permission.

657
00:58:56,625 --> 00:58:58,042
Papers!

658
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:10,125
If after seeing my papers, Sergeant,

659
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:14,833
you dare to come to attention and
salute me,

660
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:17,917
you will be sent to the front.
Understood?

661
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:25,292
Yes, Sir. Captain! Here you are.

662
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:27,167
What about the other one?

663
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:31,042
Get the fuck out you Jewish swine!
Now!

664
00:59:31,542 --> 00:59:32,750
Get the fuck out!

665
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:42,917
Ear plugs. Put in your ear plugs.

666
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,167
Yes, Sir, Captain.

667
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:50,958
You see Karol,

668
00:59:51,042 --> 00:59:54,542
I suffer because I'm
here on orders of the people

669
00:59:55,917 --> 00:59:58,167
I hate with all my soul.

670
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:02,250
Although I was proud of the SS once.

671
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:05,750
Proud of the uniform.

672
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:12,542
Because it is beautiful, isn't it?
Exquisite styling, do you like it?

673
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:15,708
I prefer you in a suit.

674
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,083
The thoughtless elite,
to which my family also belongâ€¦

675
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:27,417
saw in Hitler an opportunity
for profit and expanding influence.

676
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:32,500
Not until the barbarians
started burning books,

677
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:37,167
did the lament over
the fall of German culture begin.

678
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,833
The fatherland of philosophers and poetsâ€¦

679
01:00:41,458 --> 01:00:43,458
Why are you telling me all this, Max?

680
01:00:44,792 --> 01:00:46,917
What do you expect of me?

681
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:54,167
I was only trying to tell you why I want
you to think of me as your friend.

682
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:07,167
-Goodnight.
-Karol. Karol, wait, please.

683
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,625
You probably think that I come here
because of Krystyna.

684
01:01:16,917 --> 01:01:20,625
But no, I come here because of you.

685
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:24,750
I thought that weâ€¦

686
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:32,250
Max!

687
01:02:57,917 --> 01:02:59,875
Counsellor, sirâ€¦

688
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:03,000
I brought you some coffee.

689
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:08,625
I'm sorry Mrs.Stefa
but I had a sleepless night.

690
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:10,875
Mr. Grodecki is here.

691
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:14,750
-Please show him in then.
-Here's your coffee.

692
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:15,792
Thank you.

693
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:19,625
Please come in, the counsellor
will see you.

694
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:22,833
Good morning.

695
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:30,333
You really gave our people a scare
at The Muse last night.

696
01:03:30,792 --> 01:03:33,000
When you told Kugelman
in the restroom

697
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:34,708
that your companion is an SS officer,

698
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:36,542
he almost shit himself, sorryâ€¦

699
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:39,083
Well he was in the right place for it,
you know?

700
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:47,625
I was most afraid that professor Langman
would greet me as a friend.

701
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,583
But he isn't much of a waiter.

702
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:53,542
I didn't know you knew each other.

703
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,708
But, counsellor, Max really shouldn't
come to The Muse.

704
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:03,083
Unfortunately, I'm afraid he will.

705
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:06,542
He's the one who brought me there
after all.

706
01:04:08,917 --> 01:04:11,500
You befriended an officer of the SS?

707
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:13,292
NOVEMBER 22ND, 1941

708
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:18,542
He was the perfect cover
for me and Aneta.

709
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:20,583
But also for our covert activities.

710
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:25,042
With my notary friend, we sell Jewish

711
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:28,125
real estate to Poles
on this side of the wall.

712
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:31,542
We falsify deeds and records
and sell as legal ones,

713
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,833
and the proceeds go to the ghetto.

714
01:04:35,917 --> 01:04:38,000
Yes, I know, the Major told me.

715
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:39,958
You know,

716
01:04:41,917 --> 01:04:43,625
when it happened,

717
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:49,708
and it was just the day after our evening
escapade and his homosexual advances,

718
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:54,042
I was wondering how hard it
must have been for him

719
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:56,250
to overcome shame
and to finally call me.

720
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:00,458
I got drunk the day before yesterday

721
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:02,958
and said some silly things,

722
01:05:03,917 --> 01:05:05,417
<i>I don't even remember whatâ€¦</i>

723
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:08,667
There's nothing to talk about, Max,

724
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,833
especially since something
terrible has happened.

725
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:17,208
Krystyna is dead.

726
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:18,875
What?

727
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:22,042
She's dead?

728
01:05:22,667 --> 01:05:24,250
<i>She was murdered.</i>

729
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:25,292
What?

730
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:26,625
When, by whom?

731
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:29,292
<i>Why didn't you call me?</i>

732
01:05:30,042 --> 01:05:34,208
I called the police, the so-called blues,
since it's under their jurisdiction.

733
01:05:34,292 --> 01:05:35,250
Right.

734
01:05:36,417 --> 01:05:37,750
<i>Do they have any leads?</i>

735
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:39,667
None.

736
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:45,042
Well, there is one, Cesia,
the maid has disappeared.

737
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,500
This is horrible.

738
01:05:50,292 --> 01:05:52,208
I so admired Krystyna.

739
01:05:53,292 --> 01:05:55,000
Such a beautiful and wise woman.

740
01:05:55,542 --> 01:05:57,292
<i>I am very sorry for your loss.</i>

741
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:03,042
<i>-I will do whatever I can for you.</i>
-Thank you. Thank you, Max.

742
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:25,875
Yes?

743
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:28,125
Good evening, Madam.
Is your husband home?

744
01:06:31,417 --> 01:06:35,417
Good evening. My husband's out,
driving a tram. What's this about?

745
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:38,500
I have a letter for him
from a friend in the army.

746
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:41,792
-The army, from KozĹ‚owski, right?
-Exactly.

747
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:44,208
Probably more trashy stuff again.

748
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,875
Sir, he is the biggest pervert I know.

749
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:51,375
He sells bornography
at the Kercelak market.

750
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:56,083
-Pornography, you mean.
-That too maybe, I don't know.

751
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,125
Good morning.

752
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,625
Wielgat, Szymon?

753
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:12,875
Yes, what is it?

754
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:15,625
You are detained
to be questioned as a witness.

755
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:16,792
A witness?

756
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,500
Enter!

757
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,458
Inspectorâ€¦

758
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:27,875
Thank you, dismissed.

759
01:07:31,792 --> 01:07:33,792
Have a seat, please, Mr. Wielgat.

760
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:40,417
Mr. Wielgat, this week you are
working first shift.

761
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:43,958
So that last week
you were on the second shift.

762
01:07:44,042 --> 01:07:47,625
-What time do you leave for work?
-A quarter to two.

763
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:51,875
And what did you do before work,
last Thursday?

764
01:07:51,958 --> 01:07:53,417
Did you go out anywhere?

765
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:57,833
Just a momentâ€¦

766
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:04,500
I just went to see a friend in SĹ‚uĹĽewiec

767
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:08,083
to borrow a long staff,
because I promised

768
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:12,042
the parish priest that I would play
St. Joseph

769
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:15,583
in the nativity play and we were
already rehearsing.

770
01:08:18,042 --> 01:08:21,292
No, that's not it, that wasn't on
Thursday but on Wednesday.

771
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Fine.

772
01:08:25,292 --> 01:08:28,917
And is the name
Aneta Landau familiar,

773
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:34,792
she used to live in a studio
in your building.

774
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,208
Not at all.

775
01:08:40,375 --> 01:08:41,625
Not at all familiar.

776
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:43,167
Not at all?

777
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:45,417
Iâ€¦ I don't knowâ€¦

778
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:51,458
She slept in your kitchen,
you don't remember?

779
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:53,958
Well, yesâ€¦ Wellâ€¦

780
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:58,958
She stayed one or two nights
with us and left.

781
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,417
Why did she leave?

782
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:04,417
I don't know.

783
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:08,000
She went to Lviv supposedly,

784
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,208
maybe the Germans detained her.

785
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:16,667
-Do you suffer from some illness?
-No.

786
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:22,042
I mean yes. I have acid reflux.

787
01:09:22,667 --> 01:09:24,417
Get heartburn oftenâ€¦

788
01:09:28,458 --> 01:09:29,667
I see.

789
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,333
And due to this heartburn, you entered
the kitchen where the girl was sleeping?

790
01:09:36,417 --> 01:09:37,875
What are you saying?

791
01:09:39,417 --> 01:09:40,750
How do you know this?

792
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:45,583
My wife told you,
the crazy old wench!

793
01:09:45,667 --> 01:09:47,417
No, not your wife.

794
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,333
Maybe you told
about your night time foray

795
01:09:51,417 --> 01:09:53,042
in search of the golden fleece.

796
01:09:53,583 --> 01:09:55,208
I'm done with all of that,

797
01:09:57,667 --> 01:10:02,542
I confessed to the priest
about jacking off and the pornography

798
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:04,667
and I received absolution.

799
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:08,250
And I do not commit those sins anymore
and I will not have new ones!

800
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,375
You're lucky that
you are a moron, Mr. Wielgat.

801
01:10:17,917 --> 01:10:21,792
Go back to your wife
and instead of soda, use bromide.

802
01:10:22,708 --> 01:10:24,792
I don't want to see you again.

803
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:28,250
Yes?

804
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:32,833
Here you are.

805
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,417
-Be real, be clearâ€¦
-Yes, yes, of course.

806
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,917
<i>Do you still wear your favorite
Ambra Nera?</i>

807
01:10:57,583 --> 01:11:00,250
<i>I'll never forget your
shining eyes when you</i>

808
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:04,250
<i>spread a drop of Ambra
on your wrist and said:</i>

809
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:07,583
<i>this is a thoughtful scent.</i>

810
01:11:07,667 --> 01:11:10,292
<i>My Dear, my Ange!</i>

811
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:13,000
-Good evening Max, have fun.
-You too.

812
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:54,417
Madame?

813
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,208
Madame?

814
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:08,667
Egon! You bastard.

815
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:14,083
You tricked me!
You should be an actress!

816
01:12:23,125 --> 01:12:25,458
Why do you wear this?
You want to be more manly?

817
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:26,917
You already are.

818
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:35,042
Harry Pile, by the Nile,
washes his balls with Persilâ€¦

819
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:40,375
Harry Pile, by the Nile,
washes his balls with Persilâ€¦

820
01:12:40,458 --> 01:12:44,875
Harry Pile, by the Nile,
washes his balls with Persilâ€¦

821
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:41,167
Who is he?

822
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,708
It turns out that it's
a friend of our Max,

823
01:13:45,667 --> 01:13:47,750
I found out where he lives by accident,

824
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:50,292
because Max's black Mercedes
is often parked

825
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:52,458
by this villa in MokotĂłw.
It's there.

826
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,750
Weird, such a big shot lives there
without security.

827
01:13:57,042 --> 01:13:59,000
Are you still following this Max?

828
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:02,000
-I was just passing by.
-Really?

829
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:02,958
Yes.

830
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:07,500
Cadet Vultureâ€¦

831
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:10,375
Vulture,

832
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:12,708
if the Major finds out,

833
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:15,833
he will kick your ass
from here to Sunday.

834
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:20,292
I won't rat you out.
I know nothing in case.

835
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:23,292
But I won't defend you, this is the army,

836
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:24,917
not some private mission.

837
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:14,333
And what brings you, count?

838
01:15:14,417 --> 01:15:15,542
Good evening.

839
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:23,375
Inspector, I didn't tell you everything
during our conversation.

840
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:25,083
That's what I thought.

841
01:15:27,625 --> 01:15:28,625
Thank you.

842
01:15:35,167 --> 01:15:36,083
I'm listening.

843
01:15:37,292 --> 01:15:42,583
You see, that scope on my balcony,

844
01:15:42,667 --> 01:15:46,167
I set it up to spy on that Cesia.

845
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:49,792
And I did, for months.

846
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,875
So young, lustful and flirtatious.

847
01:15:57,333 --> 01:16:01,125
And in truth it was she who "shot" me
with her behind.

848
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:04,667
And she had no clue that the Count
was peeping on her?

849
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:09,917
I don't actually know.
She made faces, danced.

850
01:16:10,792 --> 01:16:14,958
She'd put a pot on her head,
and walk around,

851
01:16:15,042 --> 01:16:17,375
you know, in just her panties,

852
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:20,333
and those
wonderful tits would swingâ€¦

853
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:26,417
Anyway, I proposed that she visit me,

854
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,917
offered good money,
she refused every time.

855
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:35,583
Once she even scorned me most
cruelly, but then,

856
01:16:35,667 --> 01:16:38,250
in the kitchen,
she would prance and teaseâ€¦

857
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,667
Oh wellâ€¦

858
01:16:42,333 --> 01:16:46,125
Mostly, I came to tell you that,

859
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:48,292
on the day of the murder,

860
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:54,333
I saw a man
walk Cesia out of the apartment.

861
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,167
He walked her out?

862
01:16:58,125 --> 01:17:01,167
Inspector, there was a round-up in
the street.

863
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:07,833
I don't want anyone to think
that I denounced her out of revengeâ€¦

864
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:15,125
I may be an old whore aficionado but, sir,
I am no low-life snitch.

865
01:17:16,917 --> 01:17:18,500
Did it look like an arrest?

866
01:17:19,042 --> 01:17:20,667
It seemed so.

867
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:23,625
I was taking the elevator down
to take out the rubbish

868
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:26,375
and saw them for just a brief moment.

869
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:32,958
His dark back, her face,
and it seemed that she was crying

870
01:17:33,042 --> 01:17:36,875
and he was holding her strongly
by the arm like he was pulling her along,

871
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:39,458
like he wanted
to force her to go with him.

872
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:49,167
I present Inspector RafaĹ‚ KrĂłl.

873
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,875
The correct pronunciation is RafaĹ‚ KrĂłl.

874
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:59,208
Ernst Kluge, Kriminalrat.
Thank you for coming.

875
01:17:59,917 --> 01:18:01,542
It is my duty.

876
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:04,625
You speak excellent German.

877
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:07,583
I am from Galicia, sir.
I served in the army

878
01:18:07,667 --> 01:18:09,750
of Emperor Joseph
through the entire war.

879
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:15,208
You had that privilege, me too,
but just at the end.

880
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:20,250
And we both managed to survive.

881
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:26,333
Willi, shut the door!

882
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:31,667
Inspector.

883
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:37,792
You are investigating the murder
of one Krystyna Maria Holzer?

884
01:18:39,083 --> 01:18:41,583
Sir, in accordance with the
leadership's decree,

885
01:18:41,667 --> 01:18:44,292
Polish criminal matters are
under our jurisdiction.

886
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:47,333
This is why
we didn't report this to you.

887
01:18:47,417 --> 01:18:48,458
Yes, I know.

888
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:52,167
I'm interested in the name Holzer.

889
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:53,625
It sounds German.

890
01:18:55,042 --> 01:19:01,750
Why are you leading the investigation
and not the Wilcza Street division?

891
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:06,250
Even before the war, I was regarded
as a specialist in murder cases

892
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:12,792
and besides, ironically, there are
few murders lately of a civilian nature.

893
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:18,000
The atavistic human need for blood
is being more than satisfied.

894
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:19,292
Every day.

895
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,167
Who was the victim?

896
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:28,458
Krystyna Holzer was the wife of
counsellor Holzer, unemployed I believe.

897
01:19:28,542 --> 01:19:29,458
Leads?

898
01:19:31,042 --> 01:19:33,250
The one person who might have been

899
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:36,042
a witness or the perpetrator
has disappeared.

900
01:19:36,125 --> 01:19:39,125
It was their maid,
a young village girl

901
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:47,667
named Celina Ratajczak.

902
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:52,667
Besides, we asked the Gestapo in writing,

903
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:54,833
if they have any information about her

904
01:19:54,917 --> 01:20:00,417
but we received a reply that this person
wasn't registered in any document.

905
01:20:02,542 --> 01:20:07,250
You applied in writing
and someone called back.

906
01:20:09,042 --> 01:20:10,583
Did they identify themselves?

907
01:20:10,667 --> 01:20:13,375
No, the operator took the call

908
01:20:14,417 --> 01:20:16,250
and she didn't dare ask for a name.

909
01:20:22,667 --> 01:20:25,417
Very well, thank you, Inspector.

910
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,875
If something new turns up,
please inform me.

911
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:33,500
As a matter of course, sir.

912
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:44,250
The German Kripo is
interested in the case.

913
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:47,417
I was interrogated by criminal
counsel Kluge.

914
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,958
He is a professional.
I know he won't let it go.

915
01:20:50,917 --> 01:20:52,500
I was afraid of that.

916
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:57,375
You must leave Warsaw, immediately.

917
01:20:57,458 --> 01:21:00,542
I'm prepared for that,
I even have a bag packed.

918
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:05,458
Do you think I should call Max?

919
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:09,417
No, don't do that, remember
about the Major's operation.

920
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,500
You can come back
when this blows over.

921
01:21:11,958 --> 01:21:13,042
Goodbye.

922
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:20,458
Everyone, please come in here
for a moment.

923
01:21:26,167 --> 01:21:30,500
I mentioned once that
I might have to disappear for some time.

924
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:35,667
I must leave Warsaw immediately.

925
01:21:36,417 --> 01:21:37,833
Please bring me my bag.

926
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:44,042
Take care of ongoing cases yourselves
but do not start new ones.

927
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:47,667
Close the office under the pretense
of renovation.

928
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,250
Here are three months salaries.

929
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:59,125
Mrs. Stefa, this is the address of
dr. Tschervinka in Zakopane.

930
01:21:59,208 --> 01:22:03,750
Send correspondence there please,
but only the really important ones.

931
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:07,083
Besides that, you know nothing,
I fell ill and went to a spa.

932
01:22:07,167 --> 01:22:08,583
Left no address.

933
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:10,167
May the Lord guide you, sir.

934
01:22:11,542 --> 01:22:13,208
Mrs. Stefa, the Lordâ€¦

935
01:22:14,917 --> 01:22:16,917
Does God not see
what is going on here?

936
01:22:17,375 --> 01:22:20,375
Do you think He might take
an interest in me?

937
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:31,542
Inge, connect me
with Pawiak prison command.

938
01:22:32,042 --> 01:22:34,875
Willi brought the translator,
they're waiting here.

939
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:37,417
Let them in and you connect me.

940
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:45,292
This is criminal counsel Kluge.

941
01:22:45,375 --> 01:22:48,708
Please bring the female prisoner
here for interrogation.

942
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:53,583
Ce-li-na Ra-taj-czak.

943
01:22:54,417 --> 01:22:55,792
Yes, Ratajczak.

944
01:22:56,708 --> 01:22:58,000
Very well, I'm waiting.

945
01:22:58,875 --> 01:23:02,792
I need you to urgently translate
some documents as soon as I finish.

946
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:05,875
Willi, close the door.

947
01:23:05,958 --> 01:23:06,875
Yes, sir.

948
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:13,625
To Auschwitz? When? November 20th?

949
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:19,167
All the Count saw was his back and hat,
it could have been anybody.

950
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:23,292
And he was probably right
that it was that undercover cop.

951
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:26,125
There was a roundup,
Cesia was running away

952
01:23:26,208 --> 01:23:29,875
but he was adamant to catch her
and put her in the truck. That's all.

953
01:23:29,958 --> 01:23:33,792
I pity her,
but thousands of our countrymen

954
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:36,042
experience these things every day.

955
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:43,375
That's true but if Mr. Traube says that
the poor thing got sent to Auschwitz

956
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,500
we've hit a wall. No motive at all.

957
01:23:46,583 --> 01:23:48,708
He mentioned that name

958
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:52,208
but he was informed
that she had been sent away.

959
01:23:52,292 --> 01:23:56,167
I remember clearly, Celina Ratajczak.

960
01:24:43,583 --> 01:24:46,667
Hans, take three, four days off.

961
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:51,333
I'm taking the car.
If anyone asks, say that

962
01:24:51,417 --> 01:24:53,708
I had important family matters.

963
01:24:54,625 --> 01:24:55,750
Thank you very much.

964
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:00,208
Please take care, Count.

965
01:25:33,792 --> 01:25:36,208
Good morning, is Karol here?

966
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:39,792
No, unfortunately,
the counsellor is not here.

967
01:25:39,875 --> 01:25:43,167
He's gone out of town.

968
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:46,208
When?

969
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:49,292
A week, ten days?

970
01:25:49,833 --> 01:25:50,833
Where to?

971
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:54,667
A spa, he is ill.

972
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:56,833
Where is this spa?

973
01:25:57,333 --> 01:26:00,583
I don't know, Busko?
Ciechocinek, Krynica?

974
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:03,125
Address! I must have the address.

975
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:05,667
I don't have it, he didn't leave one.

976
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:09,458
Mrs. Stefa, he is in danger.

977
01:26:10,167 --> 01:26:12,750
I must save him!

978
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:15,750
-He didn't leave anâ€¦
-He's in danger, I will hide him.

979
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:19,583
You surely have an address here,
please look for it.

980
01:26:23,042 --> 01:26:27,958
Please go in, I will look for it.

981
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:36,833
Mrs. Stefa?

982
01:28:12,042 --> 01:28:14,250
Dr. Tschervinka? Here?

983
01:28:16,167 --> 01:28:18,750
Tschervinka? Over here.

984
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:20,917
Highlander?

985
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:21,958
Say what?

986
01:28:22,042 --> 01:28:23,208
Highlander?

987
01:28:23,292 --> 01:28:26,042
I don't know, I'm from ChabĂłwka.

988
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:29,208
-What's going on, JĂłzek?
-Hi.

989
01:28:43,792 --> 01:28:44,875
Hello?

990
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:52,125
Hello?

991
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:56,250
Come in! Come in please.

992
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:03,375
Good morning, Max,
I'm a friend of Karol Holzer's.

993
01:29:03,958 --> 01:29:07,583
Doctor Tschervinka. A sick doctor.

994
01:29:07,667 --> 01:29:11,208
Isn't that something?
How can I help you?

995
01:29:12,375 --> 01:29:16,833
He gave me your address but wasn't
sure where you would assign him.

996
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:19,500
A terrible thing has happened.

997
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:21,708
Mrs. Krystyna is dead.

998
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:24,708
I was at her funeral.

999
01:29:25,667 --> 01:29:28,250
He asked me to bring photos.

1000
01:29:29,292 --> 01:29:31,583
They've just arrived
from the photographer.

1001
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:40,792
Who is this woman?

1002
01:29:42,042 --> 01:29:44,583
Because now she is also dead.

1003
01:29:46,792 --> 01:29:49,958
Karol's secretary, Stefa.

1004
01:29:53,208 --> 01:29:56,083
But I saw her before I left.
She's dead?

1005
01:29:56,917 --> 01:29:59,000
That's what it looks like, sir.

1006
01:29:59,542 --> 01:30:00,917
How do you know?

1007
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,250
That's it exactly.

1008
01:30:05,083 --> 01:30:07,333
I don't know how I know.

1009
01:30:07,417 --> 01:30:10,958
I had this even before the war.

1010
01:30:11,542 --> 01:30:14,292
Friends would show me
photos of their wives,

1011
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:16,125
and I would tell themâ€¦

1012
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:20,333
Excuse me, I would like to go
hiking with Karol today still.

1013
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:23,583
You have to go to KoĹ›cielisko,

1014
01:30:23,667 --> 01:30:26,542
to old Styrczula.
Last cottage in the village.

1015
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:29,042
-Styrczula.
-Stier-tschula?

1016
01:30:29,125 --> 01:30:32,750
Very well, goodbye then
and a speedy recovery.

1017
01:30:32,833 --> 01:30:34,000
Goodbye.

1018
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:06,792
So it looks like we might have motive.

1019
01:31:06,875 --> 01:31:09,083
He also shot her in the crotchâ€¦

1020
01:31:10,708 --> 01:31:12,917
Possible rape attempt?

1021
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,708
Let's see if she scratched his face.

1022
01:31:21,417 --> 01:31:23,042
It doesn't look like she did.

1023
01:31:24,417 --> 01:31:26,542
What was in this frame?

1024
01:31:26,625 --> 01:31:29,417
A photo from the funeral.

1025
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,625
I brought it to him myself from the Major.

1026
01:31:31,708 --> 01:31:36,625
The counsellor, Mrs. Stefa
and that German were in the photo.

1027
01:31:38,083 --> 01:31:41,250
Did Mr. Holzer leave you
the address where he is staying?

1028
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:46,542
Yes, I remember he gave Mrs. Stefa
a piece of paper with the address.

1029
01:31:46,625 --> 01:31:49,208
Mrs. Stefa then put it in the safeâ€¦

1030
01:31:50,333 --> 01:31:51,833
but the paper disappeared.

1031
01:31:51,917 --> 01:31:55,417
Someone took the piece of paper
with the address, but left the money.

1032
01:31:57,875 --> 01:32:00,000
So we know almost everything now.

1033
01:32:01,958 --> 01:32:04,208
He killed her, didn't touch the money,

1034
01:32:04,292 --> 01:32:09,333
took only Holzer's address
and the photo from the cemetery.

1035
01:32:09,417 --> 01:32:11,875
So it was someone who was looking for him.

1036
01:32:13,792 --> 01:32:18,833
-Are there other photos from the cemetery?
-But who is looking for him, Inspector?

1037
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,500
Yes, of course, there should be some.

1038
01:32:31,708 --> 01:32:33,417
Here.

1039
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:41,958
This elegant fellow.

1040
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:12,708
Please connect me
to criminal counsellor Kluge.

1041
01:34:01,042 --> 01:34:02,125
Max.

1042
01:34:05,417 --> 01:34:06,708
What are you doing here?

1043
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,792
A little visit.

1044
01:34:13,417 --> 01:34:14,833
How did you find me?

1045
01:34:15,958 --> 01:34:18,792
Finding people is my specialty.

1046
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:26,792
To tell you the truth,
I needed to be alone.

1047
01:34:28,958 --> 01:34:31,750
Which is why I left the address
only with the office,

1048
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:35,042
-Mrs. Stefa said she wouldn't give it out.
-She gave it to me.

1049
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,375
So, do you feel well-rested?

1050
01:34:40,167 --> 01:34:41,125
Yes.

1051
01:34:42,625 --> 01:34:44,375
I'm bored stiff.

1052
01:34:55,875 --> 01:34:57,542
You know, I love the mountains.

1053
01:34:58,375 --> 01:35:01,458
I read about some caves in a valley

1054
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:05,875
which name I can't pronounce.
Want to go?

1055
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:43,500
This is Mr. Grodecki, the notary.

1056
01:35:43,583 --> 01:35:47,208
Works with the office owner
counsellor Holzer.

1057
01:35:47,292 --> 01:35:49,417
It was Mr. Grodecki who called me.

1058
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:59,375
Polish swine. Butchered.

1059
01:36:01,917 --> 01:36:05,292
Call for an ambulance with a doctor.
We'll need a certificate.

1060
01:36:05,375 --> 01:36:06,625
Yes, Sir!

1061
01:36:14,833 --> 01:36:16,750
Who are these gentlemen?

1062
01:36:20,833 --> 01:36:26,083
This is counsellor Holzer, and this is an
acquaintance of the counsellor.

1063
01:36:27,083 --> 01:36:31,833
Probably close, since he cameâ€¦
I don't know him.

1064
01:36:31,917 --> 01:36:33,708
And later? After the ceremony?

1065
01:36:34,333 --> 01:36:38,542
You didn't guess from their exchange
who could this man have been?

1066
01:36:38,625 --> 01:36:41,958
A relative?
A friend, acquaintance?

1067
01:36:42,042 --> 01:36:43,708
I didn't listen in.

1068
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:46,750
I just heard them talking in German.

1069
01:36:48,917 --> 01:36:50,542
-Heil Hitler!
-God bless.

1070
01:36:55,833 --> 01:36:58,875
-Good day.
-<i>Sieg heil!</i> Germany above all!

1071
01:38:36,958 --> 01:38:40,208
My sincere apologies, sir.
I have a huge favor.

1072
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:43,250
I lost a bet with my fiancĂ©e,
and as punishment

1073
01:38:43,708 --> 01:38:45,458
I must clean up this square,

1074
01:38:45,542 --> 01:38:47,250
she walks to school through it.

1075
01:38:47,333 --> 01:38:48,667
Clean upâ€¦

1076
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:51,625
So rake it up if you're such a sucker.

1077
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:59,500
Is that a way to hold a rake, Mister?

1078
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:02,708
It's not a violin or a cello.

1079
01:39:04,375 --> 01:39:06,542
Grab it like a man grabs a wench!

1080
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:12,125
A little better now.

1081
01:39:13,083 --> 01:39:14,875
Yes, yesâ€¦

1082
01:39:25,792 --> 01:39:27,875
Intelligentsiaâ€¦

1083
01:39:30,792 --> 01:39:31,833
You know,

1084
01:39:33,125 --> 01:39:38,292
when I got the news that you are
either a prisoner of war or dead,

1085
01:39:38,875 --> 01:39:42,625
I became despondent.
I felt very lonely.

1086
01:39:44,167 --> 01:39:48,333
I met this Karol and started to
spend time with them.

1087
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:52,958
I loved this music before the war.

1088
01:39:54,208 --> 01:39:56,625
Today, I am not allowed to listen to it.

1089
01:39:59,333 --> 01:40:00,875
You are allowed here.

1090
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:03,375
What song is this?

1091
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:21,375
The more cruelty around me,
the more sentimental I become.

1092
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,708
It is a strange mystery
of the German soul.

1093
01:40:26,417 --> 01:40:30,125
I did not seduce her, she seduced me.

1094
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:34,792
And I was smitten.

1095
01:40:36,333 --> 01:40:38,875
Our trysts became regular.

1096
01:40:39,583 --> 01:40:42,750
I started to find ecstasy in them,

1097
01:40:43,833 --> 01:40:45,292
but because

1098
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:48,875
I found fulfillment in inflicting pain.

1099
01:40:51,583 --> 01:40:55,083
Whenever she collapsed
exhausted and whispered.

1100
01:40:55,625 --> 01:40:59,917
I can't, I just can'tâ€¦
Yes, moreâ€¦ Don't stop

1101
01:41:08,667 --> 01:41:11,708
Don't stopâ€¦ moreâ€¦

1102
01:41:21,958 --> 01:41:26,917
As time went by she became more
insatiable, impatient,

1103
01:41:27,375 --> 01:41:30,042
she wouldn't even let me
take off my coat.

1104
01:41:30,125 --> 01:41:34,833
Didn't care that my belt buckle
was painfully hitting her spine.

1105
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:40,208
Once I was even able to imprint on
her beautiful back,

1106
01:41:40,292 --> 01:41:43,167
our war motto, in a negative, of course.

1107
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:47,458
Lie to me my beloved,

1108
01:41:50,333 --> 01:41:52,750
tell me you'll take me away,

1109
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:56,042
to the end of the world,

1110
01:41:59,958 --> 01:42:02,917
that we'll live in a hut on a sand dune,

1111
01:42:05,708 --> 01:42:08,917
that at dawn you'll sail away
to cast your nets,

1112
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,917
and that I will wait on a little
bench in front of the hut,

1113
01:42:14,708 --> 01:42:16,792
shading my eyes

1114
01:42:16,875 --> 01:42:20,333
and searching for your boat
on the horizon,

1115
01:42:23,792 --> 01:42:26,750
and listening to that little heartbeat

1116
01:42:26,833 --> 01:42:28,625
in my balloon-like belly.

1117
01:42:30,875 --> 01:42:33,292
Tell me that's how it'll be,

1118
01:42:33,917 --> 01:42:37,083
lie to me but tell me.

1119
01:42:39,375 --> 01:42:40,625
So I lied,

1120
01:42:42,167 --> 01:42:46,125
lied brazenly while inside I laughed

1121
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:49,083
at her wistful female stupidity.

1122
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,458
As it turned out,
the ridicule was untimely.

1123
01:42:56,458 --> 01:42:57,542
Listen.

1124
01:42:58,583 --> 01:42:59,917
I have news for you.

1125
01:43:01,167 --> 01:43:04,042
Someone is coming who will change
your life and mine,

1126
01:43:04,125 --> 01:43:05,458
will change our lives,

1127
01:43:05,542 --> 01:43:06,500
Jesus?

1128
01:43:07,458 --> 01:43:10,917
You're right, he will be a god.
The god of our family.

1129
01:43:19,042 --> 01:43:22,083
I will take you to the Wehrmacht
hospital for the abortion.

1130
01:43:23,083 --> 01:43:25,167
They do it all the time.

1131
01:43:25,917 --> 01:43:29,167
Unless the father and mother
belong to the master race.

1132
01:43:30,583 --> 01:43:32,750
I am, but you?

1133
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,833
Polish mother?

1134
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:37,208
Me? I am a Jewess.

1135
01:43:41,667 --> 01:43:43,167
You didn't know?

1136
01:43:46,208 --> 01:43:48,583
You knocked up a Jewess.

1137
01:43:54,792 --> 01:43:56,208
I planned it.

1138
01:43:58,458 --> 01:44:00,875
Because I couldn't take
the fear anymore.

1139
01:44:02,125 --> 01:44:03,833
And to live as if in a prison.

1140
01:44:05,917 --> 01:44:09,000
And you will be the father
of little Saul or Moshe.

1141
01:44:10,208 --> 01:44:13,917
And if they're twins? Or triplets?
There will be a Sarah too!

1142
01:44:14,583 --> 01:44:16,833
The boys will be circumcised

1143
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:19,875
and the girl will have it
sideways, like her mommy.

1144
01:44:20,917 --> 01:44:25,375
Mine is sideways, isn't it?
And I will have it!

1145
01:44:26,875 --> 01:44:29,417
I will give you a Jew!
You hear me?

1146
01:44:30,375 --> 01:44:33,833
Because the war will end.
And you will lose!

1147
01:44:33,917 --> 01:44:37,708
And then my father will come,
little Saul's grandfather.

1148
01:44:37,792 --> 01:44:40,542
And little Saul will inherit his wealth,

1149
01:44:40,625 --> 01:44:43,417
so much that you could buy
fucking Pomerania with it!

1150
01:44:44,375 --> 01:44:48,208
So much that when you find out
just how rich I am, you will grow a beard,

1151
01:44:48,292 --> 01:44:51,042
go to the ghetto and
ask to be accepted by the kahal!

1152
01:44:56,417 --> 01:45:00,375
Take your pants off, you SS swine,
you faggot!

1153
01:45:01,208 --> 01:45:04,042
You think I don't know you're in love
with my husband?

1154
01:45:04,125 --> 01:45:06,458
You fuck me but you only
think of his ass!

1155
01:45:07,792 --> 01:45:11,583
Take them off so I can circumcise it
and make you a Jew!

1156
01:45:16,625 --> 01:45:17,792
A little Jewâ€¦

1157
01:45:48,333 --> 01:45:51,875
A certain Kluge from Kripo,

1158
01:45:53,167 --> 01:45:56,208
damned if I know why,
suddenly got interested

1159
01:45:56,292 --> 01:45:58,708
in this maid of the Holzers.

1160
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:02,125
It made me nervous,

1161
01:46:04,167 --> 01:46:06,208
I couldn't leave any witnesses.

1162
01:46:06,750 --> 01:46:10,083
This is the address of the doctor
in Zakopane.

1163
01:46:10,167 --> 01:46:12,583
Only he knows
where the counsellor is.

1164
01:46:16,083 --> 01:46:17,417
Do you like it?

1165
01:46:18,208 --> 01:46:19,458
What?

1166
01:46:19,542 --> 01:46:23,167
It is the scent of Ambra Nera.
That's it.

1167
01:46:33,042 --> 01:46:34,042
Watch out!

1168
01:46:35,417 --> 01:46:38,333
Watch out? But you intend to kill me.

1169
01:46:39,292 --> 01:46:41,083
Where did you get such an idea?

1170
01:46:46,958 --> 01:46:48,875
Why did you bring me here?

1171
01:46:51,625 --> 01:46:52,750
You know Max,

1172
01:46:54,375 --> 01:46:56,500
I got a flash of insight suddenly.

1173
01:46:58,792 --> 01:47:01,083
I understood that you killed Krystyna.

1174
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:06,042
I don't know why you did that.
But I know it's you.

1175
01:47:06,125 --> 01:47:07,542
Yes, I did.

1176
01:47:08,708 --> 01:47:09,917
I had to.

1177
01:47:11,417 --> 01:47:12,458
You had to?

1178
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,125
Yes, I had to.

1179
01:47:15,708 --> 01:47:18,958
I had an affair with her.
She got pregnantâ€¦

1180
01:47:20,875 --> 01:47:22,625
You had an affair with her?

1181
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:27,208
I, Captain Maximilian
Graf von Fleckenstein

1182
01:47:27,292 --> 01:47:29,333
was to be father to a Jewish bastard?

1183
01:47:30,042 --> 01:47:32,125
This would dishonor the entire family!

1184
01:47:33,583 --> 01:47:35,875
It is the times we live in Karol!

1185
01:47:35,958 --> 01:47:39,792
-Did you know that your wife was a Jewess?
-She wasn't my wife.

1186
01:47:39,875 --> 01:47:41,667
But you shared a bedroom.

1187
01:47:42,958 --> 01:47:44,625
She wouldn't make love in there.

1188
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:49,125
I thought that
she suffered because she loved you.

1189
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:54,542
-And because you loved her.
-Yes, I loved her.

1190
01:47:55,458 --> 01:47:57,375
But I never told her.

1191
01:47:59,375 --> 01:48:02,000
We were both pretending
that we're married because

1192
01:48:02,083 --> 01:48:05,417
we knew we had to fight against this
love, we couldn't afford it.

1193
01:48:06,667 --> 01:48:07,917
Oh well, Max.

1194
01:48:10,042 --> 01:48:11,500
It's the times we live in.

1195
01:48:12,125 --> 01:48:15,458
Karol, save me.

1196
01:48:19,833 --> 01:48:21,000
You know Max,

1197
01:48:22,875 --> 01:48:25,917
I had fatherly
affection for you sometimes.

1198
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:31,375
I killed Mrs. Stefa,

1199
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,458
I killed that doctor from Zakopane,
because of you.

1200
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:38,250
And now,

1201
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:40,500
accept my death.

1202
01:48:40,583 --> 01:48:42,542
You can still be happy!

1203
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:44,292
Max!

1204
01:48:45,542 --> 01:48:48,792
-For you!
-Max!

1205
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:54,833
Karolâ€¦

1206
01:48:59,667 --> 01:49:01,833
I loved you soâ€¦

1207
01:49:01,917 --> 01:49:04,083
So you whacked him. Very good.

1208
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:07,625
He could have made trouble for you.

1209
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:10,958
You have to leave for some time.

1210
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:15,292
Go to Pomerania and hide so nobody
sees you there.

1211
01:49:15,375 --> 01:49:19,042
Tell the family that you are on leave,
and I will spread a rumor here

1212
01:49:19,125 --> 01:49:21,875
that I gave you a secret assignment
to complete,

1213
01:49:22,625 --> 01:49:24,542
and when everything settles down,

1214
01:49:25,167 --> 01:49:26,917
I will come for you.

1215
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:46,792
I need to go for a while but I'll be
right back and I'll finish it.

1216
01:49:47,292 --> 01:49:48,375
Gotta take a crap?

1217
01:49:57,750 --> 01:50:00,667
I'll put in your travel orders
dated yesterday.

1218
01:50:01,458 --> 01:50:03,958
Around 10, there is
an express train to Berlin,

1219
01:50:04,917 --> 01:50:09,500
but in Posen, you will transfer
to a train to Kolberg.

1220
01:50:10,708 --> 01:50:13,292
From there,
you won't have to far to go home.

1221
01:50:14,083 --> 01:50:15,583
Max, get it together!

1222
01:50:30,292 --> 01:50:31,375
You feel better now?

1223
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:35,708
A little, but I have to go home.
Tummy ache.

1224
01:50:38,625 --> 01:50:40,125
Take a swig then.

1225
01:50:41,208 --> 01:50:44,042
-I can't, I'm a boy scout.
-Boy scout!

1226
01:50:44,125 --> 01:50:48,292
This is a stomach remedy, from apples.

1227
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:49,792
Thank you, sir.

1228
01:50:51,375 --> 01:50:54,792
If you're bored, come do some raking!

1229
01:50:54,875 --> 01:50:56,875
You always have my permission.

1230
01:50:57,333 --> 01:51:00,708
WARSAW
CENTRAL RAILWAY STATION

1231
01:51:26,375 --> 01:51:29,000
Two to Gottenhaffen.
First class, discounted.

1232
01:51:29,083 --> 01:51:30,625
Which discount fare?

1233
01:51:30,708 --> 01:51:33,458
Volksdeutsch and
a school ticket for my son.

1234
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,167
Heil Hitler!

1235
01:51:37,917 --> 01:51:39,625
Hey you, I got some business.

1236
01:51:40,083 --> 01:51:41,125
What?

1237
01:51:41,208 --> 01:51:45,292
Lend me the bag and the newspapers.
I'll pay you well and leave a deposit.

1238
01:51:45,375 --> 01:51:47,167
-How much?
-However much you want.

1239
01:51:47,958 --> 01:51:48,958
What for?

1240
01:51:49,042 --> 01:51:51,333
I bet my brother that I can sell papers.

1241
01:51:52,333 --> 01:51:55,208
-Are you both nuts or what?
-Not dangerous though.

1242
01:51:55,292 --> 01:51:57,458
So, what do you want for an hour?

1243
01:51:58,542 --> 01:52:00,958
A hundred. For the rental.

1244
01:52:05,250 --> 01:52:06,833
And a hundred for the deposit.

1245
01:52:29,667 --> 01:52:31,500
Have a good trip, pretty lady.

1246
01:54:14,542 --> 01:54:19,542
21, 22, 23â€¦

1247
01:54:21,792 --> 01:54:23,125
a moment longer,

1248
01:54:25,583 --> 01:54:30,542
28, 29.

1249
01:54:32,250 --> 01:54:33,208
30!

1250
01:54:37,042 --> 01:54:39,625
For Aneta! For Mrs. Stefa!

1251
01:54:57,125 --> 01:54:58,375
Out of the way!

1252
01:54:58,458 --> 01:55:00,875
Stand back, back!

1253
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:03,458
Idiots!

1254
01:55:10,708 --> 01:55:12,542
Sisters! Get to work!

1255
01:55:20,458 --> 01:55:22,458
Many thanks, gentlemen.

1256
01:55:27,625 --> 01:55:28,833
She is dead.

1257
01:55:29,667 --> 01:55:34,000
Maximilian von Fleckenstein,
captain of the SSâ€¦

1258
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,458
This was in the pocket.

1259
01:56:13,917 --> 01:56:17,083
Now, the Gestapo will have to
make the whole case disappear.

1260
01:56:17,167 --> 01:56:18,375
But they'll manage.

1261
01:56:19,292 --> 01:56:22,167
What about counsellor Holzer?
Did your people find him?

1262
01:56:22,667 --> 01:56:24,458
No, he must have gone underground.

1263
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,083
I'll tell them the case is closed
and not to look for him.

1264
01:56:28,167 --> 01:56:31,750
But I advise you to disappear
for a while.

1265
01:56:31,833 --> 01:56:34,417
The Gestapo can be overzealousâ€¦

1266
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:37,125
I'll take it under consideration.
Thank you.

1267
01:56:37,208 --> 01:56:43,250
And one more thing, I got that Celina
out of Auschwitz and interrogated her.

1268
01:56:43,333 --> 01:56:45,583
She should also disappear.

1269
01:56:45,667 --> 01:56:49,417
I advised her to be sick.
She is simulating typhoid.

1270
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:52,750
They placed her at the
infectious disease hospital

1271
01:56:52,833 --> 01:56:56,958
in the city so as not to cause
an epidemic in Pawiak prison.

1272
01:56:57,042 --> 01:57:00,167
She'll be fine, she's a smart girl.

1273
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:01,708
I've never seen her.

1274
01:57:02,875 --> 01:57:05,250
Your loss, she's perfect.

1275
01:57:07,042 --> 01:57:08,667
Goodbye, Inspector.

1276
01:57:09,667 --> 01:57:11,667
Goodbye, counsellor.
