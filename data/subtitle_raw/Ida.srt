SOLOPAN
presents:

2
00:02:35,327 --> 00:02:38,399
Her name is Wanda Gruz.
She is your aunt.

3
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:43,366
We wrote to her many times asking her
to take you.

4
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:45,358
But she never did.

5
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:48,363
Maybe she never got the letters?

6
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:52,438
She did. Because finally she replied
that she couldn't come.

7
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:56,285
You should meet her before
you take your vows.

8
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:58,363
She is your only living relative.

9
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:02,518
Do l have to, Mother?

10
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:04,436
Yes, Anna.

11
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:10,326
You will go to see her and stay there
for as long as necessary.

12
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:58,322
Are you Wanda Gruz?

13
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:01,363
- l am your niece.
- l know who you are.

14
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,277
Come in.

15
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,276
Are you hungry?

16
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:13,396
No, thank you.

17
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:17,437
Take a seat.

18
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:26,402
What did they tell you about me?

19
00:06:27,407 --> 00:06:29,284
That you are my aunt.

20
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:33,442
That's all?

21
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:37,438
They didn't tell you who l am?
What l do?

22
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:40,396
No.

23
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:52,524
Why didn't you come to take me from the
orphanage?

24
00:06:56,447 --> 00:07:00,486
l couldn't. l didn't want to.
You wouldn't have been happy with me.

25
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,284
l'm going.

26
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:04,396
God bless.

27
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:06,476
God bless you.

28
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:19,483
So you are a Jewish nun.

29
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,482
Who?

30
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,324
You're a Jew.

31
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,358
They nevertold you?

32
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:41,398
Your real name is lda Lebenstein.

33
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:45,359
You're the daughter ofHaim
Lebenstein and Rozy Herc.

34
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:49,363
You were born in Piaski, nearLomza.

35
00:07:58,447 --> 00:07:59,516
Wait.

36
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:23,442
This is Roza...

37
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:26,398
And this is you.

38
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:32,327
We've had our little family reunion...

39
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:33,521
l must get dressed. l'm late.

40
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:39,396
What time is yourtrain?

41
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:40,522
l have a bus in the evening.

42
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,284
Do you need any money?

43
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:44,396
No.

44
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:47,398
- Goodbye then.
- God be with you.

45
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,279
Goodness.

46
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:11,477
...a whole bed of red tulips...

47
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:16,321
...planted by socialist scouts
to honour...

48
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:23,286
...the accused mowed them down...

49
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:26,443
...with this here sabre...

50
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,483
...inherited from his grandfather...

51
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:34,478
...a member of Pilsudski's Legions.

52
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:22,443
Roza had an artistic soul.
l liked adventures.

53
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:24,476
We were very different.

54
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:29,400
She was always making things,
from pieces of cloth or glass.

55
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:31,478
Once she made a stained glass window...

56
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:34,439
And put it in the barn
to make the cows happier.

57
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:37,322
This is yourfather.

58
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:43,406
Not an interesting type, a bit primitive.
l didn't like him.

59
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:47,397
Theirwhole clan was from there.
We were from Lublin.

60
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:51,397
Because of him she ended up in that hole.

61
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,285
You have to wearthis hood all the time?

62
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:05,442
You're a redhead too, right?

63
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:10,442
l had a brother?

64
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:15,399
No, you were an only child.

65
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:27,277
l'm going to Piaski tomorrow.
l want to visit their graves.

66
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:29,521
They have no graves.

67
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:34,278
Neitherthey, nor any otherJews.

68
00:11:34,447 --> 00:11:36,403
No one knows where their bodies are...

69
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,325
Maybe in the woods or in the lake.

70
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:45,358
l'll ask around.

71
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:51,480
What if you go there
and discoverthere is no God?

72
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:58,483
God is everywhere, l know.

73
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,323
l'll drive you there. We'll go together.

74
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:38,442
You're sweet.

75
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:42,436
You have such a nice dimple.

76
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,437
Three, when you smile.

77
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:50,436
Men will go crazy.

78
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,398
Do you have sinful thoughts sometimes?

79
00:12:55,487 --> 00:12:57,318
Yes.

80
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,358
About carnal love?

81
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:02,276
No.

82
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,442
That's a shame.

83
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:08,396
You should try...

84
00:13:08,447 --> 00:13:11,484
Otherwise what sort of sacrifice
are these vows of yours.

85
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,364
Praise be to Jesus Christ.

86
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:25,396
Forever and ever.

87
00:14:25,527 --> 00:14:27,483
You know who lived here before the war?

88
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:29,362
No.

89
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:30,522
-Why?
-No reason.

90
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:33,279
My husband knows...

91
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:34,442
He'll be back later.

92
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:36,476
Can we look around?

93
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:38,362
What for?

94
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:40,403
Don't worry. We won't steal anything.

95
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:42,356
l don't know.

96
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,323
Come aftertea, around four.

97
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,522
Excuse me.

98
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:59,483
Could you bless my daughter, sister?

99
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:46,362
One more, please.

100
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,356
And one forthe gentleman overthere.

101
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:13,404
Did you know the Lebensteins?

102
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:15,402
They lived here before the war.

103
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:16,436
Jews?

104
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:18,402
No, Eskimos.

105
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:22,364
Roza and Haim Lebenstein.

106
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:25,363
We had a lot ofJews here.

107
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:27,521
But those l didn't know. Sorry.

108
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:30,324
Why be sorry?

109
00:16:30,527 --> 00:16:33,360
Jesus, that's just what you say.

110
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:39,482
Did you know them?

111
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:52,482
And another one, please.

112
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:54,522
And the bill.

113
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:12,283
Ourfamily used to live in this house.

114
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:17,358
No Jews ever lived here.

115
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:19,442
l didn't say they were Jews.

116
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:26,396
lt's my house and my land.

117
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:30,278
We both know who it belonged to.

118
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:41,437
Yourfather hid the Lebensteins
during the war. Where?

119
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:44,522
Where?

120
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:46,316
ln the woods? ln some shelter?

121
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:52,285
l know who denounced Jews
and who helped them.

122
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:55,445
- Father neverwent to the Germans.
- l know.

123
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,316
How did they die?

124
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:04,443
Szymon Skiba, yourfather.
Where is he?

125
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:07,318
Don't know.

126
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:09,396
l know when someone is lying.

127
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:12,402
l can destroy you.

128
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,362
You have children.

129
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:20,324
Where is yourfather?

130
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:22,442
Don't know.

131
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:15,316
This is so Roza.

132
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:19,318
Fancy stained glass next to cow shit.

133
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:27,396
Here they are...

134
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,279
Good Christians... your neighbours.

135
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:33,404
Your mates are here.

136
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:32,442
When did you start drinking?

137
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:36,284
When l was about twelve.

138
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,439
Listen, you can make things easy
foryourself or hard.

139
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:41,442
Listen, comrade...

140
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:45,285
lt would easier if
you showed some respect.

141
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:48,439
You have to let me go.
l have immunity. l am a judge.

142
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:50,316
Lock her up.

143
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:53,437
-Will you be all right?
- Let's go.

144
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:55,523
They'll let me out tomorrow.

145
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:58,358
lmmunity...

146
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,396
No, l didn't know them.

147
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:06,396
Jews usually kept to themselves.

148
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:18,318
Were you here during the war?

149
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:20,356
l was.

150
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:24,479
Do you have some connection
to them, sister?

151
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:28,476
No, nothing.

152
00:21:34,407 --> 00:21:36,523
l'm sorry but this is all l can offer.

153
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:41,398
- Good night, sister.
- Good night.

154
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:43,476
- God be with you.
- God be with you.

155
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:45,436
Thank you.

156
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:18,398
l hope you will accept our apologies,
comrade.

157
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:23,366
- lt was foryour own good. You were indisposed.
- Go to hell.

158
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:25,442
Safe journey.

159
00:22:51,527 --> 00:22:53,358
Who are you?

160
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:01,402
Nobody these days...

161
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:05,443
But l used to be a state prosecutor once.

162
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:08,516
Big public trials.

163
00:23:13,287 --> 00:23:15,278
l even sent a few people to death.

164
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:22,476
Who?

165
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:25,476
Enemies of the People.

166
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:28,323
This was in the early fifties.

167
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:33,323
Red Wanda -that's me.

168
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:38,363
Gone with the wind.

169
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:40,443
Want a doughnut?

170
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:01,443
What'll happen when we find this Szymon?

171
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:07,477
He'll tell us how your parents died
and where they're buried.

172
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,516
That's what you wanted, no?

173
00:25:01,407 --> 00:25:02,442
-Where are you going?
- To Szydlow.

174
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:04,436
So are we.

175
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:07,436
Cigarette?

176
00:25:13,407 --> 00:25:14,442
Where can you get these?

177
00:25:15,487 --> 00:25:17,318
State secret.

178
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:20,476
What's in the case? Asaxophone?

179
00:25:21,447 --> 00:25:22,482
Yes. Alto.

180
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:25,318
Beautiful instrument.

181
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:26,476
Male, sensuous.

182
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,522
Do you live in Szyd,lw?

183
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:33,396
No. We're doing a gig there.

184
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:35,364
To celebrate the town's anniversary.

185
00:25:36,527 --> 00:25:38,324
And you?

186
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:48,399
Will you come to the dance tonight?
Might be fun.

187
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:50,279
Why not.

188
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:51,362
Thanks.

189
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:19,481
Not bad, our lad.

190
00:26:28,447 --> 00:26:30,483
Do you know Szymon Skiba?
He lives around here.

191
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:32,442
Skiba? No.

192
00:26:33,487 --> 00:26:36,524
But ask Marek at the bar.

193
00:26:37,527 --> 00:26:40,360
He knows everyone. Ask him.

194
00:27:42,447 --> 00:27:44,358
-He's not here.
-When's he back?

195
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:47,325
- They took him to the hospital with...
-When's he back?

196
00:27:47,407 --> 00:27:50,399
Tomorrow. Or later...
God willing.

197
00:27:58,407 --> 00:28:00,398
Maybe he's hiding from us.

198
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:28,325
- Cold.
-What?

199
00:28:28,447 --> 00:28:30,324
Cold.

200
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:33,316
Where is He?

201
00:28:46,407 --> 00:28:47,476
Which one do you want?

202
00:28:49,487 --> 00:28:50,522
Neither.

203
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:55,366
Come on, you won't stop being a nun.

204
00:28:56,327 --> 00:28:57,476
YourJesus didn't hide
in a cave with books...

205
00:28:58,287 --> 00:28:59,481
But went out into the world.

206
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:02,358
l'm not going anywhere.

207
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:03,482
What?

208
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,278
l'm not going anywhere.

209
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:08,438
Fine, l'll have fun on my own.

210
00:31:18,447 --> 00:31:20,278
C'est la vie.

211
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:34,359
l thought we were here
because of my parents.

212
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,482
We are.

213
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:57,404
l loved Roza very much.

214
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:07,280
You are so similar.

215
00:32:11,487 --> 00:32:13,443
l won't let you waste your life.

216
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:24,516
Of course...

217
00:32:27,407 --> 00:32:29,523
l'm a slut and you're a little saint.

218
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:48,446
This Jesus of yours adored people like me.

219
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:00,436
Take Mary Magdalen...

220
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:06,483
Let's have a read.

221
00:33:14,487 --> 00:33:17,399
What a beast came out.

222
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:49,523
What was that you played?

223
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:54,400
Naima by Coltrane. Did you like it?

224
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:56,396
Very much.

225
00:35:02,407 --> 00:35:03,442
You're a funny couple.

226
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:06,284
My aunt and me?

227
00:35:06,447 --> 00:35:07,436
l know.

228
00:35:08,327 --> 00:35:09,442
We only met two days ago.

229
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:13,522
Where are you from?

230
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:15,516
From a village. Not farfrom here.

231
00:35:16,487 --> 00:35:18,443
But l was raised in a convent.

232
00:35:22,527 --> 00:35:24,483
And now l'm Jewish, too.

233
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:30,320
And l've got some gypsy in me.

234
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:34,436
So why are you here?

235
00:35:36,407 --> 00:35:38,477
l'm looking for a man who knew my parents.

236
00:35:52,327 --> 00:35:54,283
Thank you.

237
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:02,443
He's probably still in the hospital.

238
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,318
l'll wait downstairs.

239
00:38:01,527 --> 00:38:03,324
Let's go.

240
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,402
Remember me?

241
00:39:03,327 --> 00:39:05,318
You knew the Lebensteins during the war.

242
00:39:06,407 --> 00:39:08,284
We'd like to know where they're buried.

243
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:11,284
l'm their daughter.

244
00:39:14,327 --> 00:39:15,316
Roza.

245
00:39:17,407 --> 00:39:19,318
l'm lda.

246
00:39:24,407 --> 00:39:25,442
They were...

247
00:39:26,527 --> 00:39:28,404
Good people...

248
00:39:31,407 --> 00:39:33,363
l hid them in the woods...

249
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:38,318
Fed them...

250
00:39:38,527 --> 00:39:41,280
And then you killed them.

251
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:56,438
Was he very scared?

252
00:39:59,407 --> 00:40:00,442
Who?

253
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:09,476
The boy.

254
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:34,476
How did you do it?

255
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:42,396
With an axe?

256
00:41:08,527 --> 00:41:10,518
l left him with Roza...

257
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:20,436
And went to fight...

258
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:26,324
For God knows what.

259
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:42,523
l hardly knew him.

260
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:42,482
Praise be to God.

261
00:42:57,327 --> 00:42:59,522
Leave my father alone,
let him die in peace.

262
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:04,358
Nobody can prove anything anyway.

263
00:43:05,527 --> 00:43:07,324
What happened, happened.

264
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:09,398
What do you want?

265
00:43:12,327 --> 00:43:16,445
You give up claims to the house
and l'll show you where they're buried...

266
00:43:20,327 --> 00:43:21,396
And you leave us in peace.

267
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:27,402
Deal?

268
00:43:29,367 --> 00:43:30,482
Yes.

269
00:43:37,287 --> 00:43:38,276
Good.

270
00:43:39,447 --> 00:43:40,516
See you tomorrow.

271
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,436
l know l can trust you, sister.

272
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:41,482
So?

273
00:44:42,487 --> 00:44:44,478
Did you find that man?

274
00:44:45,487 --> 00:44:46,522
Yes.

275
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:58,396
What now?

276
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,403
You're going back to the institution?

277
00:45:03,487 --> 00:45:06,479
You mean the convent? Yes.

278
00:45:07,487 --> 00:45:09,398
For long?

279
00:45:10,447 --> 00:45:11,436
Forever.

280
00:45:16,487 --> 00:45:18,443
l'm taking my vows next week.

281
00:45:28,327 --> 00:45:30,283
And you?

282
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:35,319
l'm mainly trying to avoid the army.

283
00:45:37,287 --> 00:45:38,276
And vows too.

284
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:52,517
You've no idea of the effect
you have, do you?

285
00:49:41,367 --> 00:49:42,402
And me?

286
00:49:43,367 --> 00:49:44,516
Why am l not here?

287
00:49:54,407 --> 00:49:55,396
You were tiny...

288
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,438
No one would know you were Jewish.

289
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,279
l took you to the priest
and left you there.

290
00:50:08,487 --> 00:50:12,321
The boy was dark and circumcised.

291
00:50:16,487 --> 00:50:18,318
lt wasn't father...

292
00:50:19,527 --> 00:50:21,358
l killed them.

293
00:51:53,367 --> 00:51:55,403
We'll go to Lublin.

294
00:51:58,367 --> 00:52:00,323
We have a family grave there.

295
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,363
lf that graveyard still exists.

296
00:52:08,527 --> 00:52:10,279
We should find a priest.

297
00:52:11,327 --> 00:52:12,476
You mean a rabbi.

298
00:52:15,327 --> 00:52:16,396
Don't drink now.

299
00:52:20,367 --> 00:52:22,437
lt's a long way, l'll sober up.

300
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:25,325
Will you come to my vows?

301
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:29,437
No, but l'll drink to your health.

302
00:55:53,327 --> 00:55:55,363
lt's a pity Roza couldn't see you.

303
00:56:56,367 --> 00:56:57,482
So?

304
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:35,481
Our Fatherwho art in heaven,
Hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come...

305
00:59:07,527 --> 00:59:10,280
l'm not ready.

306
00:59:10,367 --> 00:59:12,323
Forgive me.

307
00:59:43,407 --> 00:59:47,320
ln front of all you sisters gathered here
and you Mother Superior...

308
00:59:47,407 --> 00:59:52,322
l vow chastity, poverty and
obedience...

309
00:59:53,367 --> 00:59:56,518
Do not despise, Lord,
this heart, repentant and humble.

310
01:01:02,527 --> 01:01:04,438
Do you have a car?

311
01:01:06,327 --> 01:01:07,442
Of course.

312
01:01:09,407 --> 01:01:11,318
Will you drive me home?

313
01:01:14,327 --> 01:01:16,318
Not now. Sit down.

314
01:01:28,487 --> 01:01:30,523
She has such beautiful hair.

315
01:01:33,327 --> 01:01:35,363
But she hides it away.

316
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:39,324
Who?

317
01:01:43,327 --> 01:01:44,396
lda.

318
01:07:38,327 --> 01:07:41,478
Comrade Wanda Gruz contributed greatly...

319
01:07:42,527 --> 01:07:45,360
To the creation of a new Poland...

320
01:07:46,407 --> 01:07:49,365
Tenaciously exercising People's justice...

321
01:07:58,367 --> 01:07:59,356
...farewell comrade...

322
01:07:59,527 --> 01:08:02,325
You'll live forever in our memory.

323
01:11:08,487 --> 01:11:10,284
What are you thinking about?

324
01:11:10,487 --> 01:11:11,476
l'm not thinking.

325
01:11:15,407 --> 01:11:18,479
We're off to Gdansk to do some gigs.
Wanna come?

326
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,324
Ever been to the seaside?

327
01:11:23,327 --> 01:11:24,316
l haven't been anywhere.

328
01:11:24,487 --> 01:11:26,284
Come along, then...

329
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:31,279
You'll listen to us play,
we'll walk on the beach.

330
01:11:32,447 --> 01:11:33,436
And then?

331
01:11:46,487 --> 01:11:47,522
Then we'll buy a dog...

332
01:11:48,447 --> 01:11:50,403
Get married, have children...

333
01:11:51,487 --> 01:11:52,476
Get a house.

334
01:11:53,367 --> 01:11:54,402
And then?

335
01:11:59,327 --> 01:12:01,443
The usual hassles. Life.
