1
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,500
Call the strippers.

2
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,416
[man 2] Okay.

3
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,000
[man 1] Get him two of those blondies.

4
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,583
[man 2] Don't need you to remind me
about calling the ladies.

5
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,791
[Simple-Chun] Tell your boss to hurry up.

6
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:22,333
Not being on time,
how the fuck is he a boss?

7
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,500
[man 1] As you know,
our boss is quite busy.

8
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,125
Just wait a bit longer.

9
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,375
Let me ask Pretty-Pan to call him
Pretty-Pan!

10
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,458
Call the boss to see where he's at.

11
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,000
[Pretty-Pan] He's almost here.

12
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,833
Boss, just a bit longer.

13
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,958
Almost here.

14
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,625
I got ladies waiting for me,
I'm leaving if he isn't here soon.

15
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,041
Boss Chun, I got a question for you.

16
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,708
I heard you guys got some
new chicks in from Vietnam.

17
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,000
When do we get to play with them?

18
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,083
When?

19
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,833
Come on, say something!
Don't be so stingy.

20
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,791
Boss is here.

21
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,375
Boss is here.

22
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,250
[car door closes]

23
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,500
[Qing] Boss.

24
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,041
[all] Boss.

25
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,583
[spits]

26
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:40,291
Why the fuck would you ask me
to come to this shit-hole?

27
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,291
What the fuck are you doing?

28
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:46,416
-What the fuck are you doing?
-[Simple-Chun crying]

29
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,708
[Simple-Chun groaning]

30
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:54,458
You're quite an unpopular fella,
aren't you?

31
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,583
-Why don't you just retire?
-Retire, my ass!

32
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,750
Just because you said so?
Who the fuck am I, then?

33
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,458
Even if I agree to retire,
my brother wouldn't easily agree to that.

34
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,500
Fuck. [groaning]

35
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,625
[cell phone ringing]

36
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,041
[man] President.

37
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,625
-[groaning]
-Boss.

38
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,750
-[Simple-Chun groaning]
-President is on the phone.

39
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,333
[sighs]

40
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,166
Boss.

41
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,166
[President on phone] What the hell
do you think you're doing?

42
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,000
Did you forget who is in charge?

43
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,208
Nah, it's not like that, boss.

44
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,291
[President] Remember, his father
was like a brother to me.

45
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,333
Let the man go!

46
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,750
Fine, I'll take care of it.

47
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,458
What?

48
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,833
I'm the fuckin' chosen one.

49
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,083
You're just a little bitch to me.

50
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,791
[screaming]

51
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,500
[Simple-Chun] Fuck you! Fuck you!

52
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,125
[groaning]

53
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,125
Boss, are you all right?

54
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,791
All right? I'm dying here.
"All right," my ass!

55
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,291
Can you walk?

56
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,791
[Ren] Boss...

57
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:33,208
"Boss," why don't you be the boss, then?

58
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,083
Boss,

59
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,458
I don't get it, why worry about it?

60
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,958
Everyone wants a piece of North Town.

61
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,583
-I'm just taking it over for the family.
-Impossible.

62
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,666
What do you mean impossible?

63
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,041
That pig, I can easily
have him taken care of.

64
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,625
So long as I am still alive,
this will never happen!

65
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,666
You know I have sworn to Hada's grave.

66
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,333
That was only a half a year ago.

67
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,791
Have you forgotten already?

68
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,708
Huh?

69
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,708
At this rate, do you know

70
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:09,375
how many innocents
will be involved because of you?

71
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:13,583
How many more of our boys
must sacrifice their lives?

72
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
[sighs]

73
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,625
Ren,

74
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,750
remember why we joined the family.

75
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,541
After all, what we all want
is a peaceful life.

76
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,333
Now that you don't have any needs,

77
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,000
a wife, a child, a career,

78
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,541
isn't this the peaceful life you wanted?

79
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,000
What more do you want?

80
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,916
A word of advice, control your ambition.

81
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,875
-Lou, let's go.
-Hmm.

82
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,083
Boss, what now?

83
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,666
We are the big dogs,
not somebody's bitches.

84
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,250
Shut the fuck up.

85
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,833
You have a problem with my boss?

86
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,458
No, I wouldn't dare.

87
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,250
[dishes clattering]

88
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,708
[door closes]

89
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,625
[Ren's wife] You're back.

90
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,791
I'm back.

91
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,333
Are you hungry? Want some porridge?

92
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,833
Nah, you go ahead.

93
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,500
How about some chicken soup?

94
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,333
[sighs] Sure, why not?

95
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,333
Mmm.

96
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,708
What's this?

97
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,125
Our child's school agenda.

98
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,416
I thought you were the one
who signed her homework.

99
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,000
I want you to see it.

100
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,958
Her teacher says
she did a great job on her writing.

101
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,041
She's very smart,

102
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,958
though she constantly asks,
why bother studying at all?

103
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,083
What about it?

104
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,000
She's just like me when I was young.

105
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,250
[people chattering]

106
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,916
Hurry, roll it.

107
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,166
Reveal it, Boss, let's do it!

108
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,750
Po, are you sure you're going to do this?

109
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,833
Boss, there's no such thing
as mercy on the table.

110
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,291
Hit it while it's still hot!

111
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,250
All in!

112
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,333
[laughing]

113
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,833
Fine.

114
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,916
All in, with extra.

115
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,166
[all groaning]

116
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,000
Wait, wait, l have something to say.

117
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,083
This is how much I already won today,
and if I win one more round,

118
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,916
boys, each of us is going
to get a blondie tonight, all on me!

119
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,625
[laughing]

120
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,625
Now you're getting cocky, huh?

121
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:40,541
Roll it.

122
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,750
[grunts]

123
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,458
[all] Deal.

124
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,708
[Big-C] Qing.

125
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:47,625
Big-C.

126
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:49,875
Big-Ren.

127
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,125
[laughing]

128
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,291
Po.

129
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,208
What's up, Big-C?

130
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,875
I've got shit luck so far, come,
bring me some fortune.

131
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,833
Heard what happened with North Town.

132
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,083
President wasn't happy about it.

133
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,458
[groans]

134
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,666
He has his ways of doing things.

135
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,625
Don't worry too much about it.

136
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,375
Nah, he is my boss after all,
I can understand.

137
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,250
Huh?

138
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:19,791
Big?

139
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,166
Bigger the better.

140
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,416
Oh. Oh!

141
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,791
I think it's a big one.

142
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,041
-The biggest one?
-Huh.

143
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,458
Show it! [shouting]

144
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,166
Now that boss has Big-C on his side,

145
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,166
how is it fair for us?

146
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:37,708
Now who's your daddy?

147
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,041
[Po] Come on, have some mercy.

148
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,208
Qing.

149
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,875
Go get Big-C his share for this month.

150
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay.

151
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,500
Bro, come join me later.

152
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,625
[laughing]

153
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,541
Gotcha.

154
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,375
Hurry, now it's my turn.

155
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,833
[line ringing]

156
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,000
[cell phone vibrating]

157
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,333
Hello, who is this?

158
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,291
Hey, brother, it's me.

159
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,583
Long time no see.

160
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,166
Hey, brother, long time no see.

161
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,625
Why called me all of sudden? What's up?

162
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,916
Got time to hang out? I'm at Room 18.

163
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,583
Sure, I'll be right there.

164
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,958
Domination!

165
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,541
[man] Boss, boss.

166
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,708
It's your turn.

167
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,333
Is there a rule that says
I must play it right away?

168
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,750
But I'm dominating this round.

169
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:45,958
Dominating, my ass.

170
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,166
Last time I checked, I was still the boss.

171
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,083
[laughing]

172
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,625
Boss, let me come with you.

173
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,416
Nah, stay and enjoy your food.

174
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,916
[cell phone beeping]

175
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,791
-Hey.
-[gasps]

176
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,750
My brother.

177
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,666
Long time no see.

178
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,250
Long time no see.

179
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,875
What have you been up to? Huh?

180
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,625
Some plans are in motion.

181
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,250
-Hey.
-What's up?

182
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,875
I heard about your failed attempt
to acquire North Town.

367
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:03,875
[Po] Nah, I'm not shitting you.

368
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,666
However, I think those are fake.

369
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,125
Because for a skinny chick
to have a pair that size naturally,

370
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:11,291
-no fuckin' way.
-Oh.

371
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:13,833
I wasn't even drunk!

372
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,916
All right,
that's enough bullshit for the day.

373
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,666
-Drink up.
-Cheers.

374
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,375
I'm done for now.

375
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,333
Since you're a pussy, drink soup.

376
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,583
[laughing]

377
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,833
That's cool. I'll be the pussy, then.

[newscaster on TV]
The new electronic buses

379
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,083
now come with the Hello Kitty design

380
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:35,750
and have already taken
the local residents by storm.

381
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,416
Breaking news.

382
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,875
Last night in Taipei Zhongshan district,
a man died falling off a building.

383
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:45,958
The deceased person
was a known gang leader in the area.

384
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,333
The police investigation found that

385
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:49,375
the deceased was tortured before he died

386
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:51,875
and had his fingers cut off.

387
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:54,416
The police believe this could be a murder.

388
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,666
A witness saw

389
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,583
men in black clothing
leaving the building.

390
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:03,333
After investigating, police learned that

391
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:04,833
the famous Jian Corp might be involved.

392
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:07,291
After having a short meeting

393
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,333
with the Jian Corp president,

394
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,041
Jian Corp stated that

395
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:12,750
they are not related
to the deceased in any way.

396
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:16,208
Police currently have
a couple of suspects under investigation,

397
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:19,208
especially those who had finance exchange
history with the deceased.

398
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:21,333
Meanwhile, the investigation continues

399
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:24,666
-as more questions remain unanswered.

403
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:59,416
Mr. Gui, step forward.

404
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:06,041
Commence with three bows to the deceased.

405
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,708
First bow.

406
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,625
Second bow.

407
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,708
Third bow.

408
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,000
Appreciation to the participants.

409
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,333
Sorry for your loss.

410
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,625
Thank you, Uncle Gui.

411
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,416
I'm so sorry.

412
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,500

Madam, this is Jian.

420
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:16,041
He is a great friend of Boss Chun.

421
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,416
I'm sorry for your loss.

Accept it, accept it.

Please do let me know
if there's anything I can do to help.

-Please.

Please, have a seat.

00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:55,625
-Take the President home.
-Yes, Boss.

430
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:58,333
Brother.

431
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,333
-Brother, long time no see.
-Brother.

432
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,750
Did I look good up there?

433
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:08,708
I see you're doing well for yourself

434
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:10,791
and your boys.

435
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:12,625
Remember?

436
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:16,916
Three years ago,
you were the only one there for me.

437
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,541
Now that everything is going so well,
I also want you to do well.

438
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,583
Ren.

439
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,666
When I said I want you to do well,
I wasn't kidding.

440
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:26,958
This 40-foot cargo container
is worth over 800 million,

441
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:29,083
and it already has customs clearance.

442
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:31,875
This is just one of many.

443
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:34,291
Take a look.

444
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,333
These are all mine!

445
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:41,625
Ren.

446
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:44,125
You've always been a brother to me,

447
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:45,833
let me be frank with you.

448
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:48,458
Based on what you have right now,

449
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:53,625
seven clubs, five pubs,
four massage parlors...

450
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:54,958
Correct?

451
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:59,208
And this, this is what I have now.

452
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:01,416
Since I am able to operate
at such a scale,

453
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,791
trust me when I say,

454
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:07,041
let us use your turf to move the goods.

455
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:11,791
You and your boys will no longer
have any trouble making easy money.

456
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,333
Well?

457
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,541
You must be kidding me.

458
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,833
When it comes to fights,
I never turn down any of them.

459
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:24,041
But international business like this?

460
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:25,583
This isn't my cup of tea.

461
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:32,833
Do you look down upon my business,

462
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,708
or do you look down upon me?

463
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:37,000
Uh...

464
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,708
Brother,

465
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:44,458
there's never "too much wealth."

466
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:48,166
However, what really matters
is how the money is made.

467
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:51,583
This is beyond my capacity.

468
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,958
Brother, don't think too much of it.

469
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:02,416
That's fine.

470
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:05,708
I know that you respect the old man.

471
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,708
He has his moral code.

472
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:10,875
But he'll come around.

473
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:16,625
We'll talk more later.

474
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:20,416
I'm hungry now.

475
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,625
Braised pork over rice.

476
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,416
Let's get some braised pork over rice

477
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,791
from that same old place.

478
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,625
Do you still go there?

479
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:32,458
Remember that girl who used to work there?

480
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:36,000

Madam.

485
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:11,291
Don't stay for too long,
remember your heart condition.

486
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:12,458
Get up.

487
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,500
Yes, your highness.

489

The wife is the real boss around here.

490
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,875
Remember, her words are law.

491
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:22,791
Yes, sir.

492
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:23,916
Take care.

493
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:29,041
-So many people.
-Yeah,

494
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:30,583
the more, the merrier.

495
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:33,083
Where is Chao?

496
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:34,625
Isn't he coming?

497
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:35,583
Chao?

498
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:37,541
He's probably busy today.

499
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,333
He's a grown-ass man,
no need to worry about him.

500
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:41,041
He's coming later.

501
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:43,625
Tell him to be more mature like you.

502
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,208
He's always like a kid.

503
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,208
Tell Chao.

504
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:50,333
It's his grandfather's anniversary
in two days.

505
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:53,208
Remind him to take me there.

506
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,833
I can't even find him.

507
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:57,791
Okay, I'll remind him.

508
00:34:58,333 --> 00:34:59,333
Come, let's get something to eat.

509
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:00,333
Sure.

510
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:02,208
Watch your step.

511

Po.

512
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:06,875
Let's go, kiddo.

513
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,916
-Remember to say hi to everyone.
-Sure.

514
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,708
Where is Chao now?

515
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:12,666
Why would I know?

516
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,333
He called me this morning
to pick up his grandmother.

517
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:15,875
Then he disappeared himself.

518
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,583
Let me call him.

519
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:21,916
Okay, go ahead.

520
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000

[violin music playing on record player]

522
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:07,708
Whoo!

523
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,458
Come on!

524
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,208
Cut the shit.

525
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:19,250

[men chattering]

527
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:37,625
Muy bien. Muy bien.

528
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:41,625
[in English] I'm calling you because, uh,

529
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:45,875
my boss wanted me to tell you
that he's very happy,

530
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:50,000
and we're looking forward
to our next transaction.

531
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,958
Sí, sí.

532
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:57,125
Ooh! [laughing]

533
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:05,625
Boss, the man is here.

534
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:10,125
Sir.

535
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:14,833
I'm Chao from North Fort,
one of Ren's boys.

536
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:18,875
[in Mandarin] What do you want?

537
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,458
Say it.

538
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,291
I'm here for the goods.

539
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,458
-Let me ask you a question.
-Hmm?

540
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:35,708
Do you think supplying drugs
is a dirty business?

541
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,208
Dirty?

542
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,333
Why? It's just business.

543
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:46,750
However, Ren doesn't think so.

544
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:49,416
He thinks drugs are beneath him.

545
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:53,166
He thinks he has no need for money.

546
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:00,500
Therefore, he doesn't know you are here.

547
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:05,208
He forbade you from dealing with drugs,
didn't you know that?

548
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:07,416

01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:48,583
Rules are rules.

920
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:51,166
Chu.

921
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:52,166
Raise the incense.

922
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,833
[sighs]

923
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,833
Oh, great Lord Guan,
the revered God of War,

924
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:02,333
I, Po of the North Fort,

925
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:06,500
thank you for this opportunity
to serve the people of North Fort.

926
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:09,791
May you watch over me

927
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:11,583
as I carry out the mission,

928
01:14:11,666 --> 01:14:13,041
and please bring me back safely.

929
01:14:35,916 --> 01:14:40,958
[Po] Easy, take it easy.

930
01:14:41,625 --> 01:14:43,958
Just keep calm.

931
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:01,583
What are you doing?

932
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:02,916
What are you doing?

933
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,583
Calling Big-Qing for backup.

934
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:07,333
Do you know how long

935
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:09,333
I have been waiting for this?

936
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:16,666
[gun cocking]

937
01:15:17,708 --> 01:15:18,625
I'm going.

938
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:22,416
Hey.

939
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:23,958
What?

940
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,541
Take care of yourself.

941
01:15:27,541 --> 01:15:32,541
Tell you what, no matter what,
remember, wait for me.

942
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:35,166
I got this!

943
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:36,750
[rattling]

944
01:16:45,208 --> 01:16:46,458
What is going on?

945
01:17:00,166 --> 01:17:03,000
What happened?

946
01:17:07,125 --> 01:17:07,958
[Jian] Hey!

947
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:14,208
Looking for me?
Make an appointment next time.

948
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:17,166
[man] Hey, over here!

949
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:46,541
You're back.

950
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:52,041
Why so sudden this time?

951
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:54,375
Have you packed everything?

952
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:57,291
Hey!

953
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:01,500
[breathes deeply]

954
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:02,416
-I'm leaving.
-Hey!

955
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:05,708
How long is it going to be this time?

956
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:10,958
I don't know.

957
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:12,708
Don't know.

958
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:13,708
You don't know?

959
01:18:26,791 --> 01:18:27,958
Is it nice over there?

960
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:36,250
Not bad.

961
01:18:39,791 --> 01:18:43,041
Try not to worry too much.

962
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,458
So I might be back before I know it?

963
01:19:03,541 --> 01:19:04,500
[boat horn tooting]

964
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:09,291
It's about time, the boat is here.

965
01:19:22,166 --> 01:19:24,208
[Qing] Captain, all good?

966
01:19:24,666 --> 01:19:25,500
Yeah.

967
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:33,875
Big-Qing, how long before I can come back?

968
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:38,583
About 20 years.

969
01:19:58,750 --> 01:19:59,583
[exclaiming]

970
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:03,041
Big-Qing, about my fiancée and my son...

971
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:06,250
I know.

972
01:20:07,666 --> 01:20:09,750
Make sure you don't call here.

973
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:11,333
Take good care of yourself.

974
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,541
[cell phone vibrating]

975
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:31,000
Hey.

976
01:20:35,541 --> 01:20:36,875
Where the hell are you?

977
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:40,708
[groans]

978
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:55,000
[knocking on door]

979
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:01,708
Fuck you.

980
01:21:01,791 --> 01:21:04,208
Fuck you.

981
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:06,000
What the fuck now, what the fuck now.

982
01:21:06,083 --> 01:21:07,250
Pretty-Pan.

983
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:10,250
Do you know what happened to him?

984
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:12,291
What happened?

985
01:21:13,083 --> 01:21:14,583
What about him?

986
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:16,583
-Tell me!
-You don't know?

987
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:19,041
You don't know?

988
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,083
Fuckin' say it one more time!

989
01:21:21,333 --> 01:21:24,416
Why the fuck are you here?

990
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:27,625
I chickened out.

991
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,458
Chickened out?
Why didn't you just call me?

992
01:21:31,208 --> 01:21:32,708
Don't you have my number?

993
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:34,125
I couldn't do it!

994
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,541
Why didn't you call me?

995
01:21:35,708 --> 01:21:37,916
Don't you have my number?

996
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:43,250
[sobbing] I didn't know this would happen.

997
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:49,166
I didn't know this would happen.

998
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:50,541
I didn't want to.

999
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:52,583
There were five of us!

1000
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:53,833
Huh?

1001
01:21:55,125 --> 01:21:57,291
Now two of our brothers are already dead!

1002
01:21:57,375 --> 01:21:59,875
How could I know this would happen?

1003
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:02,583
He was the youngest,
and now he is gone too.

1004
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:05,125
Is this how you treat your brothers?

1005
01:22:16,458 --> 01:22:19,083
Why would he do it for me?

1006
01:22:19,166 --> 01:22:21,708
I told him to wait for me in the car.

1007
01:22:23,208 --> 01:22:26,625
If you did shoot that motherfucker,

1008
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:29,375
this wouldn't have happened,
was it really that difficult?

1009
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:32,500
Do you really think I'm that brave?

1010
01:22:32,875 --> 01:22:34,458
It's all because of you.

1011
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:37,416
Because you were always there
to back me up.

1012
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:41,500
I thought I was always fearless
when you were around.

1013
01:22:44,833 --> 01:22:46,458
How would I know what would happen

1014
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:49,500
when you aren't there?
I really had no idea.

1015
01:22:55,583 --> 01:22:56,750
[sniffling]

1016
01:23:02,416 --> 01:23:04,166
Stop it.

1017
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,625
-Fuck, fuck.
-Please stop it.

1018
01:23:05,708 --> 01:23:07,041
-Fuck, fuck.
-I'm begging you, please stop.

1019
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:10,666
What the fuck is wrong with me?

1020
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:11,875
What am I supposed to do?

1021
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:13,750
What the fuck is wrong with me?

1022
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:15,291
Please stop this,

1023
01:23:16,208 --> 01:23:18,291
it pains me as well.

1024
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:22,125
When I was chosen,
I really had no idea what to do.

1025
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,375
I waited until now to call you

1026
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:29,666
because I really had no idea what to do.

1027
01:23:30,291 --> 01:23:32,375
Please tell me what I am supposed to do.

1028
01:23:41,458 --> 01:23:42,291
[sobbing]

1029
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:45,500
Please don't do this, I beg you.

1030
01:23:45,583 --> 01:23:47,083
[both crying]

1031
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:48,625
What have I done?

1032
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:51,250
You tell me, then!
What am I supposed to do?

1033
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:52,583
Tell me, then!

1034
01:23:52,666 --> 01:23:54,791
I really don't know.

1035
01:23:58,083 --> 01:24:00,916
Please, I don't know anymore.

1036
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:25,958
-Boss.
-Mm.

1037
01:24:30,208 --> 01:24:31,541
Pretty-Pan.

1038
01:24:32,666 --> 01:24:34,041
Have you taken good care of him?

1039
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:35,291
I have.

1040
01:24:35,708 --> 01:24:37,583
I've asked brothers from the other side
to help him settle in.

1041
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:49,208
A man can't help but go with the tide.

1042
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:50,875
[chuckles]

1043
01:24:54,416 --> 01:24:56,291
I'll handle this myself.

1044
01:25:04,041 --> 01:25:05,000
Lou.

1045
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:07,583
-Give them a call.
-Yes, sir.

1046
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:09,583
-Set up a meeting for me.
-Mmm.

1047
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:14,416
[car approaching]

1048
01:25:22,791 --> 01:25:25,250
-[President] Brother.
-[Yung laughing]

1049
01:25:26,333 --> 01:25:29,416
Thanks for coming.

1050
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,375
You wanted to see me.
I'd crawl my way here if I had to.

1051
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:34,208
-[laughing]
-Thank you, thank you.

[car approaching]

1053
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:37,083
Boss.

1054
01:25:37,291 --> 01:25:38,375
Secretary is here.

1055
01:25:39,166 --> 01:25:40,916
-Mr. Secretary.
-Mr. Secretary.

1056
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:41,916
This is brother Yung.

1057
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:45,250
-Welcome.
-President Gui.

1058
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:51,083
Thanks for coming.

1059
01:25:51,166 --> 01:25:53,708
It's my pleasure.

1060
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:56,708
-Thank you, once again.
-It's a pleasure.

1061
01:25:56,791 --> 01:25:58,541
Senator, thank you for coming.

1063
01:26:04,916 --> 01:26:05,791
President.

1064
01:26:16,458 --> 01:26:20,375
[President] Thank you,
thank you all for coming.

1065
01:26:20,916 --> 01:26:24,208
I am honored to be among you.

1066
01:26:25,625 --> 01:26:28,666
For the good of this community,

1067
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:34,875
I humbly ask for advice from all of you.

1068
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:37,666
Thus, we can settle our differences.

1069
01:26:38,791 --> 01:26:40,458
[clapping]

1070
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:48,541
Mr. Liu.

1071
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,666
Perhaps you have some suggestions?

1072
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,416
President, you

1073
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:02,000
are like a great father

1074
01:27:02,666 --> 01:27:07,708
trying to be the peacemaker for Ren and I.

1075
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:12,958
I am so touched.

1076
01:27:14,458 --> 01:27:16,041
Really touched.

1077
01:27:17,166 --> 01:27:18,500
My heart...

1078
01:27:19,291 --> 01:27:20,125
President,

1079
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,666
you're not young anymore.

1080
01:27:24,666 --> 01:27:27,000
Times have changed.

1081
01:27:27,833 --> 01:27:30,500
Why don't you just take a back seat, hmm?

1082
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:33,416
Young man, mind your manners.

1083
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:38,875
President.

1084
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:43,166
Your dog is trying
to take a bite out of me.

1085
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:46,166
You can't just hold on
to his leash forever.

1086
01:27:47,416 --> 01:27:50,125
Besides,

1087
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:54,833
he is already beyond your control.

1088
01:27:55,541 --> 01:27:57,458
[all shouting]

1089
01:27:57,541 --> 01:27:58,375
[gun clicks]

1090
01:28:11,166 --> 01:28:14,166
Go on, keep going.

1091
01:28:14,666 --> 01:28:16,541
Why don't you guys keep going?

1092
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:19,041
I could use a boost to my career.

1093
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:21,583
[people chattering]

1094
01:28:23,791 --> 01:28:27,375
President, Yung, I'll take my leave.

1095
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:29,416
My apologies.

1096
01:28:30,791 --> 01:28:32,125
Congressman, this way.

1097
01:28:33,625 --> 01:28:34,458
[coughs]

1098
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:37,791
Son of a bitch.

1099
01:28:38,958 --> 01:28:42,833
I've never seen anyone
more disrespectful than that little shit.

1100
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:49,041
Boss, let me drive you home.

1101
01:28:49,416 --> 01:28:52,208
Let Qing do it,
I want to have a few words with him.

1102
01:28:57,125 --> 01:28:59,375
[coughing]

1103
01:29:03,666 --> 01:29:04,958
Qing.

1104
01:29:07,791 --> 01:29:09,625
Do you know what it means to be Gatao?

1105
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:16,125
In the early days of Taiwan,
there were many Gataos,

1106
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:19,333
and they were not gangsters.

1107
01:29:20,666 --> 01:29:23,458
They were a bunch of passionate young men
with a sense of justice.

1108
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:27,291
They wanted to protect
the interests of local people,

1109
01:29:28,541 --> 01:29:33,208
and they fought the outsiders.

1110
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:40,333
As time went by,
they gained many followers

1111
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:42,375
and became forces to be reckoned with.

1112
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:44,833
That's how they won the hearts of people

1113
01:29:46,125 --> 01:29:48,333
and became the local leaders.

1114
01:29:49,416 --> 01:29:51,708
That is the real Gatao.

1115
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:58,458
Now that North Fort
is such a prosperous place,

1116
01:29:58,541 --> 01:30:01,958
people are able to live their lives
in peace because of us.

1117
01:30:03,541 --> 01:30:05,916
You can't always solve problems
with violence.

1118
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,666
Instead, you have to use your virtues.

1119
01:30:13,166 --> 01:30:14,208
Understand?

1120
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:18,791
Therefore,

1121
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:21,375
you shouldn't continue
to provoke Ren, your boss.

1122
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:23,291
Instead, you should support him.

1123
01:30:23,375 --> 01:30:26,166
Bring stability to our Gatao.

1124
01:30:27,083 --> 01:30:27,916
President,

1125
01:30:29,083 --> 01:30:30,458
I hear everything you're telling me,

1126
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:32,875
and I understand all of it.

1127
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:34,291
However, it is others
who brought this onto us.

1128
01:30:34,375 --> 01:30:35,416
I know!

1129
01:30:35,791 --> 01:30:36,625
I know!

1130
01:30:37,166 --> 01:30:39,083
[panting]

1131
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:41,750
No matter how much anger
you have right now,

1132
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:44,916
I want you to swallow all of it.

1133
01:30:45,666 --> 01:30:47,791
I... [panting]

1134
01:30:48,875 --> 01:30:49,708
President?

1135
01:30:54,041 --> 01:30:55,000
The medicine...

1136
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,208
Where is your medicine?

1137
01:31:19,625 --> 01:31:20,666
[panting]

1138
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,625
[gasping]

1139
01:31:38,666 --> 01:31:39,958
[President collapses]

1140
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:08,000
[clattering]

1141
01:32:48,625 --> 01:32:50,041
[Qing whimpering]

1142
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:52,291
[Lou] President is talking to Qing.

1143
01:32:56,416 --> 01:33:00,375
[woman] Gui! Gui!

1144
01:33:00,958 --> 01:33:02,708
Gui!

1145
01:33:02,791 --> 01:33:06,625
Ambulance, call the ambulance!

1146
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:18,791
[ambulance siren blaring]

1147
01:33:20,166 --> 01:33:21,416
The fuck are you doing over there?

1148
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:25,750
What's going on? Say something.

1149
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:29,250
Qing.

1150
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:50,666
Fuck.

1151
01:33:55,708 --> 01:33:57,333
That was my boss!

1152
01:33:58,625 --> 01:34:00,458
My boss!

1153
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:02,708
Fuck!

1154
01:34:19,791 --> 01:34:21,458
[thunder rumbling]

1155
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:08,583
Boss, let me drive you back.

1156
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:19,666
Chu, where is the car?

1157
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:21,625
Boss, it's that way.

1158
01:36:58,333 --> 01:37:01,166
[Pretty-Pan] Boss, Qing.

1159
01:37:02,541 --> 01:37:05,125
Have you ever regretted taking this path?

1160
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:15,708
After I came here,
I asked this question myself constantly.

1161
01:37:20,291 --> 01:37:22,541
I just wanted to be with you guys.

1162
01:37:23,041 --> 01:37:25,041
Like a family.

1163
01:37:32,083 --> 01:37:36,000
These days, I can't do anything,

1164
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:41,750
but get drunk.

1165
01:37:45,041 --> 01:37:47,000
[inaudible]

1166
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:54,333
I have no future.

1167
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:01,041
I miss you guys.

1168
01:38:03,041 --> 01:38:06,875
I miss Panda, I miss Chao.

1169
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:10,291
-It's Pretty-Pan.
-Grandma, it's me.

1170
01:38:11,458 --> 01:38:13,166
Pretty-Pan is getting married.

1171
01:38:13,541 --> 01:38:16,458
-I can fire three times and...
-Hit five targets!

1172
01:38:17,875 --> 01:38:19,041
So you were there?

1173
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:23,375
Hey, dipshit, you should spend
more time with your fiancée.

1174
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,000
[Pretty-Pan] Honey, remember the day

1175
01:38:41,083 --> 01:38:46,541
I promised you and our son a family.

1176
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:51,625
Sorry, I failed to keep my promise.

1177
01:38:52,958 --> 01:38:56,125
Please forgive me.

1178
01:38:59,041 --> 01:39:01,333
Boss Ren, where are you going today?

1179
01:39:03,291 --> 01:39:04,250
Home.

1180
01:39:05,666 --> 01:39:07,458
[Pretty-Pan] I really want to go back.

1181
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:14,750
Boss, Big-Qing, thank you.

1182
01:39:15,625 --> 01:39:17,083
I will never forget you.

1183
01:39:22,125 --> 01:39:24,458
However, 20 years is too long for me.

1184
01:39:24,541 --> 01:39:25,958
My heart couldn't take it.

1185
01:39:33,375 --> 01:39:36,833
It's too empty without all of you.

1186
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:50,916
Honey, promise me, take care of our son.

1187
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:56,458
Don't let him grow up like me.

1188
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,916
Tell him his father loves him very much.

1189
01:40:14,791 --> 01:40:20,166
Boss, Big-Qing, I'm going home.

1190
01:40:22,958 --> 01:40:26,583
Please take care of my family.

1191
01:40:37,666 --> 01:40:40,291
And take care of yourself.

1192
01:40:43,583 --> 01:40:44,625
Home.

1193
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:47,500
I am coming home.

1194
01:41:10,666 --> 01:41:12,333
[screaming]

1195
01:41:14,916 --> 01:41:18,041
[Qing] Pan, you're home.

1196
01:41:50,875 --> 01:41:52,916
I told him to leave.

1197
01:41:53,791 --> 01:41:54,916
He wouldn't

1198
01:41:56,708 --> 01:41:58,125
because he said

1199
01:41:59,125 --> 01:42:00,625
he had brothers like you.

1200
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:02,583
You were his family.

1201
01:42:03,291 --> 01:42:05,250
How come they're the ones who died?

1202
01:42:08,166 --> 01:42:09,000
Why?

1203
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:10,916
How come it wasn't you?

1204
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,083
How come it wasn't you?

1205
01:42:13,583 --> 01:42:15,083
Qing.

1206
01:42:15,166 --> 01:42:16,166
The Big-Qing.

1207
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:20,125
You promised me,
you promised you would bring him back.

1208
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:21,291
You promised me.

1209
01:42:21,958 --> 01:42:24,458
This isn't what you promised,
not like this.

1210
01:42:24,708 --> 01:42:26,083
Why?

1211
01:42:27,625 --> 01:42:32,583
Leave! Please, get out! [crying]

1212
01:42:34,041 --> 01:42:35,666
[boy crying]

1213
01:42:54,083 --> 01:42:55,500
[cell phone ringing]

1214
01:42:55,583 --> 01:42:57,708
Brother, it's me, Ren.

1215
01:42:58,416 --> 01:43:00,375
This is the last time
I'm calling you as a brother.

1216
01:43:00,666 --> 01:43:03,375
This phone call is just a heads-up.

1217
01:43:04,333 --> 01:43:06,083
Now it's just between you and me.

1218
01:43:06,666 --> 01:43:08,958
You and me. Understood?

1219
01:43:32,666 --> 01:43:35,166
Chu, Chu!

1220
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,208
Yes, Boss.

1221
01:43:41,166 --> 01:43:43,375
-Tell Qing to come back.
-[Chu] Yes, Boss.

1222
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:47,166
[door closes]

1223
01:44:13,833 --> 01:44:15,583
[door opens]

1224
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:40,291
Sweetheart.

1225
01:44:42,625 --> 01:44:46,708
Let me answer the question
you had for your teacher.

1226
01:44:48,833 --> 01:44:50,875
The reason why you have to study hard

1227
01:44:52,208 --> 01:44:55,916
is so that you can have
a proper career when you grow up.

1228
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:58,791
So you don't have to be like me,

1229
01:45:00,916 --> 01:45:02,791
constantly living on the edge.

1230
01:45:19,625 --> 01:45:20,458
Honey,

1231
01:45:22,541 --> 01:45:24,000
I'll be back in a bit.

1232
01:45:25,166 --> 01:45:26,541
[Ren's wife sniffles]

1233
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,791
[door opens and closes]

1234
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,833
[sobbing]

1235
01:45:59,875 --> 01:46:01,041
Big-Qing is back.

1236
01:46:01,583 --> 01:46:04,333
What the fuck is going on?

1237
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:06,875
Boss only told me to call you back.

1238
01:46:17,375 --> 01:46:18,541
What's going on?

1239
01:46:19,625 --> 01:46:20,791
I don't know.

1240
01:46:26,208 --> 01:46:28,250
-[wind howling]
-[dog barking]

1241
01:46:29,833 --> 01:46:31,916
[gun firing on mobile game]

1242
01:46:41,583 --> 01:46:42,666
Where is your boss?

1243
01:47:00,916 --> 01:47:03,916
Ren, come.

1244
01:47:12,041 --> 01:47:13,750
Join me.

1245
01:47:20,166 --> 01:47:22,916
Come, help yourself.

1246
01:47:23,833 --> 01:47:27,333
This braised pork over rice

1247
01:47:27,416 --> 01:47:29,333
is from our favorite joint
when we were young.

1248
01:47:36,125 --> 01:47:42,166
The owner, she had a daughter, remember?

1249
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:43,750
During that time,

1250
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:46,375
I had nothing.

1251
01:47:46,666 --> 01:47:48,041
Tried so hard to impress her.

1252
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:55,541
Now, I have everything,
and she's already married.

1253
01:47:55,625 --> 01:47:57,458
Such is life.

1254
01:48:05,541 --> 01:48:07,750
You're right, people do change.

1255
01:48:08,958 --> 01:48:12,083
Even this braised pork over rice
doesn't taste the same anymore.

1256
01:48:14,875 --> 01:48:17,250
The whole world is changing.

1257
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:23,375
If you don't change,
what makes you different from a caveman?

1258
01:48:30,875 --> 01:48:34,208
Jian, I still have
the same question for you.

1259
01:48:34,291 --> 01:48:36,791
When you were planning
for everything three years ago,

1260
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:38,500
did you anticipate the current situation?

1261
01:48:43,458 --> 01:48:46,125
Ren, do you know

1262
01:48:48,125 --> 01:48:50,625
who I envy the most?

1263
01:48:51,625 --> 01:48:53,041
It is you.

1264
01:48:54,208 --> 01:48:56,083
Without spending a single dime,

1265
01:48:56,166 --> 01:48:59,958
you've got a whole gang of brothers
backing you up.

1266
01:49:01,291 --> 01:49:02,125
As for me,

1267
01:49:02,958 --> 01:49:04,041
look at me,

1268
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:07,916
the amount of money I spent,

1269
01:49:08,541 --> 01:49:11,000
yet, I have no one I can trust.

1270
01:49:15,916 --> 01:49:19,666
This situation,
it wasn't that I didn't think it through.

1271
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:21,708
It's just that I didn't expect

1272
01:49:22,666 --> 01:49:24,458
it would end like this.

1273
01:49:27,041 --> 01:49:28,625
Then we have nothing left to say.

1274
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:33,333
Hey.

1275
01:49:33,416 --> 01:49:34,875
Why are you here?

1276
01:49:36,416 --> 01:49:37,541
[man] Boss.

1277
01:49:47,125 --> 01:49:50,291
Ren, don't take this the wrong way.

1278
01:49:53,208 --> 01:49:55,708
Let me ask you again, why are you here?

1279
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,333
-Huh?
-Boss!

1280
01:50:01,083 --> 01:50:04,958
It's about time, they're taking over.

1281
01:50:09,583 --> 01:50:11,500
[breathes deeply]

1282
01:50:13,125 --> 01:50:14,125
Ren.

1283
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:22,291
This world is not
what we can decide anymore.

1284
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:30,333
[gun cocks]

1285
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,541
It seems you never get the point.

1286
01:50:44,375 --> 01:50:48,958
It's not perfect, but acceptable.

1287
01:50:54,291 --> 01:50:55,916
I warned you.

1288
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,291
In the end, you still let everything
get out of control.

1289
01:51:00,833 --> 01:51:02,625
Out of control?

1290
01:51:03,666 --> 01:51:06,166
Everything is according to my plan.

1291
01:51:06,916 --> 01:51:09,000
Both North Fort
and North Town are now gone.

1292
01:51:09,083 --> 01:51:11,791
Jian Corp has already taken
the majority of Taipei.

1293
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:17,166
The northern Taiwan underground
is now under my command.

1294
01:51:17,250 --> 01:51:19,500
Isn't this what you asked me to do?

1295
01:51:22,375 --> 01:51:23,791
Your command?

1296
01:51:24,333 --> 01:51:26,375
You're still missing the point.

1297
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:30,291
What we wanted was stability.

1298
01:51:30,375 --> 01:51:32,541
All you do is cause trouble.

1299
01:51:33,375 --> 01:51:34,458
Tell me,

1300
01:51:35,208 --> 01:51:36,750
how am I supposed to keep my job?

1301
01:51:43,083 --> 01:51:44,958
Her highness has made her decision.

1302
01:51:46,250 --> 01:51:48,666
Our cooperation ends here.

1303
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:55,208
Hey.

1304
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,333
Let me tell you something.

1305
01:52:04,541 --> 01:52:08,625
Nobody tells me what to do.

1306
01:52:13,125 --> 01:52:15,708
Nobody dares to tell me what to do.

1307
01:52:16,208 --> 01:52:17,041
Hmm.

1308
01:52:18,833 --> 01:52:19,666
[gun cocking]

1309
01:52:24,875 --> 01:52:26,000
So?

1310
01:52:28,708 --> 01:52:30,041
You're going to kill me now?

1311
01:52:30,833 --> 01:52:34,291
I learned all of this from you guys.

1312
01:52:48,208 --> 01:52:50,083
[guns firing]

1313
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:53,458
Ren, it's me.

1314
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:56,708
Boss, I'm here.

1315
01:53:09,083 --> 01:53:10,958
All this fun, and you didn't invite me?

1316
01:53:23,291 --> 01:53:24,666
Watch out! Boss.

1317
01:53:35,666 --> 01:53:36,500
Use this one.

1318
01:53:45,041 --> 01:53:46,708
Boss, Qing is here.

1319
01:53:47,416 --> 01:53:49,250
-[gun firing]
-[grunts]

1320
01:53:49,916 --> 01:53:51,625
Po! Po!

1321
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:04,125
[grunting]

1322
01:54:24,833 --> 01:54:25,833
Just die!

1323
01:54:31,791 --> 01:54:32,625
Boss.

1324
01:54:49,833 --> 01:54:51,041
Qing, are you all right?

1325
01:54:51,125 --> 01:54:52,083
I'm good.

1326
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,291
[police sirens blaring in distance]

1327
01:55:15,791 --> 01:55:16,666
Are you hurt?

1328
01:55:16,750 --> 01:55:17,583
I'm fine.

1329
01:55:17,875 --> 01:55:19,708
Po, you all right?

1330
01:55:20,375 --> 01:55:21,541
Clumsy as always.

1331
01:55:21,625 --> 01:55:23,416
You aren't drunk again, are you?

1332
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:26,458
I got shot by the big one.

1333
01:55:28,375 --> 01:55:29,208
[exclaims]

1334
01:55:30,166 --> 01:55:31,416
Po, you all right?

1335
01:55:31,791 --> 01:55:32,833
Should be fine.

1336
01:55:36,583 --> 01:55:39,375
[thunder rumbling]

1337
01:55:50,375 --> 01:55:51,208
[man chattering]

1338
01:55:57,666 --> 01:55:58,833
[man] Next.

1339
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:07,458
[chattering]

1340
01:56:08,541 --> 01:56:09,625
-Boss.
-Hmm.

1341
01:56:10,083 --> 01:56:11,500
Doing all right in there?

1342
01:56:12,375 --> 01:56:13,458
Not bad.

1343
01:56:14,041 --> 01:56:17,000
Got many friends looking after me,
they send you their regards.

1344
01:56:17,083 --> 01:56:17,916
How is Po?

1345
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,125
Where is he?

1346
01:56:19,208 --> 01:56:20,333
[Qing chuckles]

1347
01:56:20,583 --> 01:56:23,333
He got into a fight with someone.

1348
01:56:23,416 --> 01:56:24,708
Fight? Again?

1349
01:56:27,166 --> 01:56:31,625
If he doesn't shape up,
he won't be calling us "brothers" again.

1350
01:56:31,708 --> 01:56:33,583
I'll tell him.

1351
01:56:35,916 --> 01:56:37,833
Boss, what about him?

1352
01:56:38,875 --> 01:56:39,958
Don't know.

1353
01:56:40,583 --> 01:56:42,833
I haven't heard of him since then.

1354
01:56:45,708 --> 01:56:46,541
No worries.

1355
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:50,291
Boss.

1356
01:56:50,375 --> 01:56:52,291
I'm sorry for causing you all the trouble.

1357
01:56:52,416 --> 01:56:54,291
Dumbass, don't be silly.

1358
01:56:56,083 --> 01:56:58,083
Make the best use of your time in there.

1359
01:56:58,166 --> 01:57:00,166
You will be back before you know it,
you hear?

1360
01:57:01,208 --> 01:57:02,333
Yes, thank you, Boss.

1361
01:57:03,625 --> 01:57:07,750
Send me a letter if you need anything.

1362
01:57:09,916 --> 01:57:11,666
[both chattering]

1363
01:57:12,416 --> 01:57:13,416
Boss.

1364
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:14,333
Boss.

1365
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:17,791
-Ask Chu if he also needs anything.
-No problem.

1366
01:57:36,208 --> 01:57:38,791
[pop music playing on speakers]

1367
01:57:43,166 --> 01:57:44,000
Here.

1368
01:57:44,083 --> 01:57:45,125
Pull now.

1369
01:57:45,208 --> 01:57:46,416
Hold right there.

1370
01:57:48,250 --> 01:57:49,750
That's him!

Hey, thanks, a little present from me.

1377
01:58:34,041 --> 01:58:35,166
Nah, don't worry about it.

1378
01:58:36,083 --> 01:58:38,000
We're from the same school.

1379
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:46,458
You're such a badass.
What are you going to do after graduation?

1380
01:58:47,750 --> 01:58:50,833
I am from North Fort. My boss is Big-Gui.

1381
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:55,000
I am going to take over
the underground for him.

1382
01:58:55,875 --> 01:58:57,583
What about you?

1383
01:58:57,666 --> 01:58:58,875
Wanna join me?

1384
01:59:01,083 --> 01:59:01,916
I'll probably

1385
01:59:02,541 --> 01:59:03,958
continue my studies.

1386
01:59:05,833 --> 01:59:08,083
I am Ren, what's your name?

[Jian] What is the song of the family?

1391
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:37,625
The "Song of Sorrow."

1392
01:59:38,125 --> 01:59:40,208
This is it, the "Song of Sorrow".

01:59:40,875 --> 01:59:46,458
