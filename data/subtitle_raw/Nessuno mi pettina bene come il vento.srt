1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,605
NOBODY COM BS ME
AS WELL AS THE WIND

2
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,970
How did it go ?

3
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,691
Someone else got the job.

4
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,406
Good. I don't want you waking up
when it's dark.

5
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,050
I might have a job pumping gas.

6
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,567
- Need money ?
- No, I still have some.

7
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,281
You shouldn't have quit dental school.

8
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,404
Not again...

9
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,924
I can provide for you
for a few more years.

10
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,084
Want more coffee ?

11
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,443
No, I'm going to sleep.
Whafll you do ?

12
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,404
The sea is choppy today.
South-west wind. ..

13
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,686
There was a dead boy
on the beach today.

14
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,409
Probably another fucking junkie.

15
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,562
You didn't get along
with grandma either.

16
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,803
Me ? Not true, we talk every day.

17
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,928
Now you do, but not before.

18
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,244
You never invited her for Christmas.

19
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,610
Gea, sorry but I need to concentrate now,

20
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,527
I have an interview soon
and don't even remember what to ask.

21
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,011
My stomach doesn't feel well.

22
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,804
<i>ln Milan they called her
"the poor man's doctor",</i>

23
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,646
<i>because she took care of people
in the worst neighborhoods.</i>

24
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,327
<i>She draped her tall, slender body
in a black suit;</i>

25
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,888
<i>a red scan' wrapped around her neck</i>

26
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,011
<i>accentuating her spindly,
almost abstract shape.</i>

27
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,962
- Good morning l
- Morning l

28
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,688
My daughter's with me because
we're going to Grosseto after.

29
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,128
I'll let you in.

30
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,806
Leave him in the car,
we won't be long.

31
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,247
No, I'll take him for a walk.

32
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,051
Usually l wake up early,
have a quick breakfast,

33
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,443
go buy the newspapers,
then I sit down and work.

34
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,602
Well, l intend to but often
l just sit staring at a blank page

35
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,242
without writing a word,
all I want to do is run away.

36
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,888
From what ?

37
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,601
A spider I saw on the wall.

38
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,364
Arachnophobia.

39
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,681
What do you do for the rest of the day ?

40
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,081
I read, go to the supermarket.
Nothing.

41
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,040
- At night?
- At night... I go to sleep.

42
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,971
Do you have any recurring dreams ?

43
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,369
Yes, I've often dreamt that it's raining

44
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,171
and my house is flooded with water

45
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,006
and I'm running around like a madwoman
trying to stop the leaks

46
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,891
but there's always a new leak so...

47
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,690
Ado l

48
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,210
Ado l

49
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,125
ls he yours ?

50
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,766
A few days ago in Paris, your husband
announced his return to politics.

51
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,404
Yes, so I read.

52
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,762
After the scandal,
you came back to live in Italy.

53
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,086
Has your relationship
with your husband changed ?

54
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,604
We haven't spoken in years.

55
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,765
During interviews, your husband
expressed great respect for you.

56
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,287
And affection.

57
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,410
Are we done ?

58
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,121
Yes, I'll get my daughter and we'll go.

59
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,847
I'm sorry if I seemed invasive,

60
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,691
but my editor would've skinned me alive

61
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,366
if I hadn't asked at least
one question about your husband.

62
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,361
EX.

63
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,570
- I'm done, we can go.
- Already ?

64
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,441
Yes, we have a long drive ahead of us.

65
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,282
Can we wait a bit?

66
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,808
Wait for what ?
I just told you I finished.

67
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,044
But I'm hungry.

68
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,482
Gea is a whiz in Italian.
She got an A on her last test.

69
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,450
- That's not true, I got a B.
- Well, a B is good.

70
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,968
Yes, but I'm at the bottom of the class
in other subjects.

71
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,964
It's a tough class, and you're not
at the bottom of the class.

72
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,726
- What was the essay about?
- The hand.

73
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,123
The hand, how interesting.

74
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,642
She even wrote some poetic things.

75
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,364
l recall one phrase: "The hand takes
but at times it asks as well".

76
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,321
How did you come up with that ?

77
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,884
Can I stay here a few days ?

78
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,883
- Here ?
- What did you just say ?

79
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,810
Why on earth
would you ask such a thing ?

80
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,165
I'm not going to grandma's.

81
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,368
I have a plane to catch for work.

82
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,410
- I was to spend Easter with dad.
- He had a change of plans.

83
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,963
- Now where are you going ?
- To the bathroom.

84
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,730
I'm sorry, I'm mortified.
I don't know how to handle her anymore.

85
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,242
Whatever I say is wrong,
whatever I do is irritating.

86
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,481
What's her relationship like
with her dad ?

87
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,411
She nearly set fire to his bathroom
last time.

88
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,484
So I should be worried ?

89
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,364
She wanted to see if alcohol
catches fire,

90
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,730
but I think unconsciously

91
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,329
she did it on purpose because
she's jealous of the daughter...

92
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,047
of her father's lady friend.

93
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,050
- Has she seen a specialist?
- Of course.

94
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,681
But she won't utter a word.

95
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,725
One night she went out alone,

96
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,611
she said the heat was bothering her.

97
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,481
We found her sleeping with her dog
on the banks of the river.

98
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,209
Can you imagine ?

99
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,890
What would you do ?

100
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,049
I don't have kids.

101
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,368
- Are you done ?
- I'm not coming out.

102
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,251
You're behaving childishly, Gea.

103
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,089
I'm really sorry.

104
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,049
Hello, Tullio ? I'm having
a problem with your daughter.

105
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,010
I'm at a writer's home,
I came to interview her.

106
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,687
Gea refuses
to come out of the bathroom.

107
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,285
I don't know what to do.

108
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,001
She doesn't want to go to grandma's,
I don't know why.

109
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,881
- Want to speak to your dad ?
- No.

110
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,682
Great, she said no.
I have a plane to catch tonight...

111
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,291
How's everything in there ?

112
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,731
I locked myself in the bathroom
when I was a kid too.

113
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,850
Once because

114
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,209
my father gave my cousin a doll
and I got nothing,

115
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,011
to me it seemed
like an unbearable insult.

116
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,171
Why can't I stay here ?

117
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,849
You're worried because my mom
told you I burned dad's bathroom ?

118
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,570
I didn't do it on purpose,
it was an accident.

119
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,124
Let me stay.

120
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,802
You don't know me, I'm a stranger.

121
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,761
My grandma's a stranger too.

122
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,611
- She's not even my real grandma.
- How so ?

123
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,805
This is embarrassing...
Tullio says he can come pick her up...

124
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,441
but tomorrow. What shall I do ?

125
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,449
How can I ever thank you ?

126
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,331
There's a conference in Bombay
on the state of women,

127
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,131
Rocca was supposed to go
since it's her field

128
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,489
but she broke a leg
so the paper decided to send me.

129
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,169
This is Gea's backpack,
her clothes and homework are in here.

130
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,567
This is surreal, I'm practically
abandoning my daughter...

131
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,727
Tullio said he'll call
before picking her up.

132
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,803
But we'll be in touch.

133
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,090
She'll tell you she's adopted,

134
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,961
her teacher told me she wrote
an essay about it, but it's not true.

135
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,361
Here you go... this is your room.

136
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,521
So, do you like it?

137
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,926
- Can Ado stay in here with me ?
- What?

138
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,922
- Can my dog stay with me ?
- No, he stays in the yard.

139
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,089
- Even at night?
- Yes.

140
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,610
I'm not used to keeping animals
in my house.

141
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,120
- I'm going out.
- Where ?

142
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,882
To the square, I don't want him
to poop inside out of spite.

143
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,251
My mom says you're very intelligent.

144
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,807
Being intelligent doesn't mean
understanding more.

145
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,691
What does it mean ?
Understanding less ?

146
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,809
At times, yes.

147
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,447
- Did you really live in Paris ?
- Yes.

148
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,049
- Did you speak in French ?
- Yes, of course.

149
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,248
So why did you come here ?

150
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,567
I like the sound of the sea.

151
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,601
- Aren't you afraid to be alone ?
- No, l like being alone.

152
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,842
I like being alone too.

153
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,170
At your age, you're never alone:
you have school, friends...

154
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,607
I have no friends.

155
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,729
Why not?

156
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,490
Dunno... nobody likes me.

157
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,530
<i>Today a reporter with her daughter
came by,</i>

158
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,322
<i>supposedly to write about me
and my work,</i>

159
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,960
<i>but she really wanted
to know about Michel.</i>

160
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,169
<i>Her daughter suddenly asked
if she could stay with me.</i>

161
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:21,406
<i>An insane request, to which
I gave an even more insane reply.</i>

162
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,649
What are you writing ?

163
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,765
A book.

164
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,131
- About what ?
- A woman.

165
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,129
Are you annoyed I'm here ?

166
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,004
No. Why, do I seem annoyed ?

167
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,281
- Did you get the job ?
- No.

168
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,724
There may be a job
in the supermarket stock room.

169
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,450
I'll go inquire today.

170
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,286
- ls 150 enough for the week ?
- I told you I don't need money.

171
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,082
How is that possible ?

172
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,527
- It's possible.
- How do you manage ?

173
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,364
I help out a friend,
we clean out clubs.

174
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,925
Your father called.

175
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,246
He said the snow
caused some car trouble

176
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,041
so he can't come today,
he'll probably come tomorrow.

177
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,044
- Does my mom know ?
- No, she didn't call yet.

178
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,288
- What do you think of my mom ?
- I don't know her...

179
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,046
- She's stressed about her daughter.
- My mom's always stressed.

180
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,122
Maybe it's partially your fault ?

181
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,850
I'll make breakfast.

182
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,321
Erica's not my real mom,
I was adopted.

183
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,040
What's that ?

184
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,047
It's true, I was adopted.

185
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,650
Your mom told you ?

186
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,564
No, she pretends it's not true.

187
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,724
- Then how do you know ?
- I remember.

188
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,884
- How old were you ?
- Probably two.

189
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,328
You can't remember anything
when you're two.

190
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,369
- I do remember.
- What?

191
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,765
We were outside, in a truck.

192
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,891
It was night.

193
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,362
There were lots of kids
and a dead horse.

194
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,486
- And then ?
- That's it.

195
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,406
Musfve been a dream.

196
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,561
There was also a gypsy
hitting us with a cane.

197
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,208
He did this to me.

198
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,489
Maybe you just fell.

199
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,366
He did this to me.

200
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,442
Hi, Yuri. How much did you rake in ?

201
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,642
- Surplus ?
- 8 grams of hash.

202
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,802
Here, it's 500.

203
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,402
150 for you.

204
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,361
Next assignment:
25 grams of Moroccan,

205
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,731
10 of Afghan,

206
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,368
and 5 of blow for the old dude.

207
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,405
- But he wants that other stuff.
- There's a war going on...

208
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,202
you can't ask for off-market goods.

209
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,251
They take it as is, furniture and all.

210
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,842
I can't take it with me.

211
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,722
They can burn it after
for all I care.

212
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,130
Memories ? Memories of what ?

213
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,930
When I could still get it up...
that's a real memory.

214
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,765
Well, what have you brought me ?

215
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,565
- The black bud ?
- Next time.

216
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,050
Good, better than last time.

217
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,971
Why are you looking at me
like that, Hamlet?

218
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,640
My name's Yuri.

219
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,969
Do I provoke disgust?

220
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,760
- Pity?
- Nothing.

221
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,848
Nothing. I wish that were the case...

222
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,247
But you're too young to understand.

223
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,810
Do you like boats ?

224
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,248
I had a boat once,
I went all over the place with it.

225
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,482
Then one day I stopped,

226
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,003
captivated by an Indian girl,
a teenager,

227
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,044
as beautiful as a goddess.

228
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,529
I married her, or rather I bought her.

229
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,847
Then I sank the ship.

230
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,966
And her as well.

231
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,528
And then I came here.

232
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,521
To bury myself.

233
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,925
I have to go.

234
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,243
- You're pale, Hamlet.
- My name's Yuri.

235
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,325
You're named Yuri,
but you're Hamlet inside.

236
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,244
A prince without a kingdom, like me.

237
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,003
- What are you drawing ?
- Spiders.

238
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,842
Don't tell me you like spiders ?

239
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,450
- It's my favorite animal.
- What's so nice about them ?

240
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,045
Nice ? Nothing.

241
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,531
Then why do you like them ?

242
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,761
Because they're ugly and scary.

243
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,809
What have you got?

244
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,250
Afghan.

245
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,164
Those guys are waiting for you.

246
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,924
Sweet l

247
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,410
- I'm going for a stroll with the dog.
- Okay.

248
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,161
Don't wander off too far.

249
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,610
- Nothing for me ?
- No, because you're a bitch.

250
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,004
Go on, smoke.

251
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,490
Who's she ?

252
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,764
What do you want? Who's she ?

253
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,651
- Dunno, never seen her.
- Hey kid, get lost.

254
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,691
What's the problem ?

255
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,083
I don't like buzzkills,
and I don't want to be stared at.

256
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,891
I'm off.

257
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,883
Me too, I'm hungry.

258
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,368
Are you gonna hit on her?

259
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,525
Go to bed, Gea,
your dad's coming tomorrow.

260
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,122
"I'll light the fire
because it's cold".

261
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,365
"Light the fire"
is that cause or effect ?

262
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,365
If the action occurs first it's cause,
if after it's effect.

263
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,243
It occurs after.

264
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,121
- What comes before ?
- An urge to scream.

265
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,369
Then scream.

266
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,450
Not in front of you.

267
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,284
I'll go.

268
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,689
- ls she staying with us too ?
- Just for a few days.

269
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,000
Good morning.
I'm Tullio, her father.

270
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,525
Arianna, nice to meet you.

271
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,526
Sorry I'm late, the roads were icy.

272
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,611
- Where'

 she sleep ?
- In your room with you.

273
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,845
No way l

274
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,480
Don't start acting up.

275
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,405
Not in my room,
you said she scares you too.

276
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,324
I never said that.

277
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,245
I just said she's an odd girl.

278
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,404
Odd ? She's got eyes like a witch.

279
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,848
- Goodbye, thanks.
- Goodbye.

280
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,890
Want me to carry your backpack ?

281
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,448
- Hi.
- Hi, Gea.

282
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,045
Hello.

283
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,961
- So who's hungry?
- I am.

284
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,565
I'm not.

285
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,764
Go on ahead.

286
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,206
Look Gea, isn't this nice ?

287
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,048
I need to talk to you.

288
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,130
I have to tell you...

289
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,603
there's been a bit of a hitch,
we can't go home.

290
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,127
I don't have the keys,
it's a long story.

291
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,644
But don't tell your mom about this...

292
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,371
We'll stay with Ginevra for a few days.

293
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,084
Just a few days,
Ginevra loves you.

294
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,761
And Marta thinks you're great.

295
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,048
- What would you like ?
- A hamburger and fries.

296
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,204
A salad.

297
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,609
- You ?
- Nothing, I already ate.

298
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,410
- Could I have plain boiled rice ?
- I'll ask the chef.

299
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,801
Thanks.

300
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,482
- Are you still ill?
- No.

301
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,967
After I had colic, Erica told me
to be more careful.

302
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,604
Right, Gea ?

303
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,281
I'll take Ado for a walk.

304
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,811
Don't leave the parking lot.

305
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,481
- I told her.
- How'd it go ?

306
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,209
Fine, she seems okay with it.

307
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,566
Marta would rather not have her
in her room.

308
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,162
Where'

 we put her then ?

309
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,089
On the sofa bed.

310
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,484
All right.

311
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,121
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

312
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,367
- Could I have some oil?
- Sure.

313
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,969
Where's Gea ?

314
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,327
I'll go see.

315
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,889
Gea !

316
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,449
- Thanks.
- Bye.

317
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,966
What happened ?

318
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,528
I don't want to stay at her house.

319
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,161
- Weren't you to stay at your dad's ?
- His house was seized...

320
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,085
because of his unlicensed
bed & breakfast.

321
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,809
I'll get an umbrella.

322
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,088
- Where are we going ?
- To the police.

323
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,891
But I haven't finished eating.

324
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,002
Yes, speaking.

325
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,490
Maybe she's dead.

326
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,565
Maybe it's best she stays with me
a few more days.

327
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,324
How kind of you,

328
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,847
but I wouldn't want to impose...

329
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,844
It's not a problem.

330
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,806
I don't know if Erica would approve,
you know ?

331
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,290
I'll send her a text.

332
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,325
Sure.

333
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,449
That's a good idea.

334
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,604
Hold on a second...

335
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,722
Gea went to Arianna's,

336
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,966
she said she could stay a few days,
what do you think ?

337
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,730
- No need to think it over!
- I was just informing you...

338
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,842
Okay, if it's no problem for you,
it's fine for us.

339
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,362
What did Gea say ?

340
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,050
He wants to speak to you.

341
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,365
Hi.

342
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,483
Yes, I have everything,
even my backpack.

343
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,566
You don't need to come here.

344
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,288
Look how hot I am l

345
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,205
- You look like a ragdoll.
- Looks who's talking...

346
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,768
- Look at her and America l
- What a couple l

347
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,287
Someone's bitter...

348
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,090
Smile l

349
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,521
Knock it off.

350
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,290
Come on.

351
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,966
She's back.

352
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,284
Of all places, why come here
and bust our balls ?

353
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,611
America, you caught her eye.

354
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,328
- Why's she killing our buzz ?
- Maybe she's lonely.

355
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,885
America, ask her to show it to you.

356
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,441
She's a kid, you asshole.

357
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,331
Only a kid would ever show it to him l

358
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,881
You're disgusting.

359
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,766
- Hi.
- Hi.

360
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,246
Cute dog, what's its name ?

361
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,442
- Ado.
- What kind of dog ?

362
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,443
He's a bastard.

363
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,771
Hear that, America ?
He's your relative.

364
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,010
- Come inside, please l
- It's about time.

365
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,402
You didn't tell me you were going out.

366
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,245
I was just in the square, no big deal.

367
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,971
I don't want you out there
with those kids.

368
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,201
Why ?

369
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,283
They vandalized the benches.

370
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,047
- You saw them do it ?
- No, but I know it was them.

371
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,369
Every night they ruin something,

372
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,046
and the next morning
the square is full of trash.

373
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,042
Enough with the noise, please l

374
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,521
The square's not yours, lady l

375
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,809
Nor yours, learn how
to be considerate of others.

376
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,203
- What a bitch !
- What did you say ?

377
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,924
Let's go.

378
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,683
- And let her win ?
- Mazinga is right though.

379
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,044
She's not in charge here.

380
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,563
Do you think I was too harsh
with those kids ?

381
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,926
You're right... poor things.

382
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,405
I should feel pity, not rage for them.

383
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,206
- I don't feel pity for them.
- What do you feel, fondness ?

384
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,802
They didn't do anything wrong.

385
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,280
So who vandalized the benches ?

386
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,605
You didn't see them.

387
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,362
But I see how they go around,
and how they talk.

388
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,447
They barely know how
to properly string two words together.

389
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,730
How odd, there are no pipes here.

390
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,201
The heating pipes
are on the other side.

391
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,964
So what is that stain ?

392
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,404
Maybe the leak is elsewhere
and just spread here.

393
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,325
Water takes
the strangest routes at times.

394
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,969
- I'm going out to the square.
- Don't wander off.

395
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,082
- This is Paco.
- Hi.

396
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,886
This isn't a late onset maternal urge,

397
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,407
she's just here for a few days.

398
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,004
She checks my phone,
I have to explain my every move.

399
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,290
All women are a threat.

400
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,721
At first I tried to reassure her,
but things just got worse.

401
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,523
I'm afraid she'll take it out
on our son.

402
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,561
Never.

403
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,330
- How do you know ?
- I know, I lived through that.

404
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,726
It's been three years,
seems like yesterday.

405
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,280
I feel like I messed everything up.

406
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,408
Don't mess up anymore.

407
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,771
Keep an eye on that stain,
and let me know.

408
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,326
Gea l What are you doing there ?

409
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,091
Nothing, just watching.

410
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,687
Don't wander off without telling me.

411
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,441
I didn't wander off, I'm right here.

412
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,810
Come here now.

413
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,051
Why do you like those kids so much ?

414
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,204
- Because they're free.
- Free from what ?

415
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,847
Free.

416
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,164
I want to show you something.

417
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,569
See this woman ?
Her name was Anna Kuliscioff.

418
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,530
She was born in Russia
to a very rich family.

419
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,890
She left it all to come to Italy
and join a group of revolutionaries.

420
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,567
She was a free woman.

421
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,129
They're back again l

422
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,403
Will you knock it off ?
People are trying to sleep l

423
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,082
Don't bust our balls, lady l

424
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,409
I've had enough l

425
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,127
Every single night...

426
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,805
What do you expect me to do then ?

427
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,442
They're not childish pranks l

428
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,962
I'm telling you, they vandalized
the benches in the square.

429
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,163
Fine, thanks.

430
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,884
Who did you call?

431
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,605
Guess.

432
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,291
- The police.
- Bingo.

433
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,602
- What did they say ?
- They're on their way.

434
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,449
Guys, the police l

435
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,570
What are you doing ?

436
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,927
Now we can finally get some sleep.

437
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,606
Good night.

438
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,610
Let's beat it l

439
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,247
You don't want the cookies ?

440
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,280
What's up, are you mad at me ?

441
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,843
Hello, mom ?

442
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,569
Everythings fine.

443
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,051
I'll be waiting outside,
when you're done we'll go run errands.

444
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,560
Okay... she's a bit snooty.

445
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,451
BETTER WATCH OUT, BITCH

446
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,843
Can you believe
what those hooligans did ?

447
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,962
Who says they did it?

448
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,963
Are you kidding me ?

449
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,165
You provoked them.

450
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,450
I just asked them not to make noise
outside my house at night.

451
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,409
Does that seem unreasonable ?

452
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,086
- You called the police too.
- So what ?

453
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,971
Didn't you hear them call me a bitch ?

454
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,521
Did you hear them or not?

455
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,524
Answer me l

456
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,250
Yes.

457
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,084
Then let's go.

458
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,724
Did you actually see them doing it?

459
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,886
Of course not, I was sleeping.

460
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,850
Well if you didn't see them,

461
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,571
you can't file a report
against them personally.

462
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,769
Same goes for the benches, I imagine.

463
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,241
Ma'am, there is no proof.

464
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,763
Who else could it be ?
I'm certain it was them.

465
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,845
Plus, they even insulted me.

466
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,410
How so ?

467
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,043
They called me a bitch.

468
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,730
- Well...
- Well what ?

469
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:37,049
If we had to intervene every time
someone says "bitch"...

470
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,006
Do you think that's normal?

471
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,845
Well...

472
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,447
- What do you think ?
- Never mind her.

473
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,322
Did you hear them ?

474
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,325
No.

475
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,163
You didn't hear them insult me ?

476
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,285
No.

477
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,682
- Why did you lie ?
- I didn't lie.

478
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,447
You said one thing to me,
and the opposite to the cop.

479
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:15,321
- I'm not a rat.
- This is about telling the truth.

480
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,530
- I did tell the truth.
- Right, like about you being adopted.

481
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,645
What ?

482
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,891
Your mom says it's a lie
that you tell people for attention.

483
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,081
Will you please knock it off ?

484
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,805
It's not night.

485
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,361
It's not night
but you're disturbing the peace.

486
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,443
You can't just do as you please.

487
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,400
I told the police about that lovely
graffiti you left for me too l

488
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,602
What graffiti ?

489
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,521
Will you please stop that ?

490
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,042
She really did it l

491
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,489
You two are such assholes.

492
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,170
What did you do ?

493
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,329
I asked them to leave.

494
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,368
Why did you lift up your skirt ?

495
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,647
They said they'd leave
if I showed them my panties.

496
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,326
- So you did ?
- Yes.

497
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,883
Do you realize what you've done ?

498
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,486
- What?
- They wanted to humiliate you...

499
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,847
you put yourself
in a position of weakness l

500
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,644
- You're in a position of weakness.
- Me ? Why ?

501
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,244
Because you're afraid of them.

502
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,524
Oh, really ?

503
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,522
Hey you, hold on l

504
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,849
Hold on l

505
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,330
<i>The ﬁrst days of her arrest
in Florence were agonizing.</i>

506
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,642
<i>She was locked in a small cell</i>

507
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,327
<i>that faced a courtyard.</i>

508
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,403
<i>She was denied any type of contact,</i>

509
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,724
<i>with her family
and with other inmates.</i>

510
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,565
<i>She was even forbidden
to write down her thoughts.</i>

511
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,042
<i>And for her,
this was most unbearable.</i>

512
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,929
- Your grandma's pissed off...
- She's not my grandma.

513
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,448
- Come with us.
- Where ?

514
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,001
To a place
where nobody busts our balls.

515
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,730
Get on.

516
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,844
Look who's here l

517
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,083
- Hey.
- Hi.

518
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,125
Why's she here ?

519
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,280
She was walking all alone
and asked me if she could come.

520
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,089
Sit down.

521
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,683
- What's your name ?
- Gea.

522
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,449
- ls that a dog's name ?
- No, it means "Earth".

523
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,282
- Ever smoked before ?
- No.

524
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,930
How old are you ?

525
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,407
11, I mean 13.

526
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,327
- Quit bullshitting us.
- Where do you live ?

527
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,967
- In Rome.
- And you never smoked a joint ?

528
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,124
Ignore him, he's an idiot.

529
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,288
Can I try ?

530
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,531
Not like that,
you have to inhale and hold it.

531
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,207
She can't take her eyes off you.

532
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,326
Come here,
I want to show you something.

533
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,964
Good girl.

534
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,122
Do you have a boyfriend ?

535
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,081
- No.
- So wanna date me ?

536
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,844
Quit fucking laughing l

537
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,291
- Not you.
- Why, you don't like me ?

538
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,242
- Wanna try something good ?
- What?

539
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,604
Drink this.

540
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,600
- What's the big deal ?
- Just wait and see.

541
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,440
Gea !

542
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,606
Why don't you want to date me ?

543
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,891
Are you crying ?

544
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,725
Of course she is, you sicken her.

545
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,128
Do I really sicken you ?

546
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,447
Say it.

547
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,249
Say it.

548
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,849
No.

549
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,725
Can you French kiss ?

550
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,404
Want to touch my thingie ?

551
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,251
But thanks for asking.

552
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,725
Where have you been ?
I searched everywhere.

553
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:11,681
- Out.
- With who, those kids ?

554
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,002
No, alone.

555
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,960
Ado ran off when I unleashed him
on the beach.

556
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,160
Come on.

557
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,041
- How's everything ?
- Fine.

558
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,203
I called your father.

559
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,122
Did you tell him to come get me ?

560
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,884
He wants to talk to you.

561
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,285
Now ?

562
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,410
Yes, now.

563
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,410
- What happened ?
- Nothing, Ado ran away.

564
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,801
Arianna searched for you for hours.

565
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,246
- Where are you ?
- In the hospital, for colic.

566
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,243
I can't come right away.

567
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,210
But I can send Ginevra
to pick you up at the station.

568
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,724
I don't want to leave.

569
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,967
Look what was in my gall bladder.

570
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,005
Three centimeters. Crazy, huh ?

571
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,404
You asleep ?

572
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,042
I don't want to be pushy
but tell me what happened.

573
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,166
You were with those kids, weren't you ?

574
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,281
I already told you, Ado ran away.

575
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,804
You don't believe me.

576
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,569
I don't know.

577
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,808
Leave the door open.

578
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,645
All right.

579
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,800
<i>Gea disappeared for hours today.</i>

580
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,760
<i>I found her walking,
dazed and alone on the highway.</i>

581
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,808
<i>l suspect she was with those kids</i>

582
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,811
<i>and that something bad happened,
but she denies it.</i>

583
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,044
<i>l should've pushed harder,</i>

584
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,283
<i>taken her to the hospital for an exam,
alarmed her parents.</i>

585
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,690
<i>Instead l did nothing.</i>

586
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,405
<i>To be discreet 7?</i>

587
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,444
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

588
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,891
Good morning.

589
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,329
Hi.

590
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,131
- Home so early?
- I did some shopping.

591
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,049
- Coffee ?
- I already had some.

592
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,005
We need to talk.

593
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,926
Go ahead.

594
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,570
Sit down.

595
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,008
I met a guy at the club,

596
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,561
a salesman from the north.

597
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,887
His wife died a few years ago.
He asked me to live with him.

598
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,841
- And you ?
- I said I need to think it over.

599
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,404
- And talk to you about it.
- Why?

600
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,964
Because you're my son.

601
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,521
I think you should do what you want.

602
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,564
You can come live with us.
He has a huge house in Varese.

603
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,888
There's nothing for me in Varese.
Plus, I found a steady job here.

604
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,643
Really? Where ?

605
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,609
In the supermarket stock room.

606
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,563
I start next week.

607
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,603
Why aren't you eating ?

608
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,611
I'm not hungry.

609
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,288
What would you like to do today ?

610
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,928
Did you do your homework ?

611
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,686
I know you want me to leave...

612
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,640
I didn't say anything.

613
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,807
I don't know where she went
or what happened.

614
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,803
Sorry, she wouldn't tell me.

615
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,360
What ?

616
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,047
Yes, I did tell your husband that...

617
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,603
But now there's a different issue:

618
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,003
I can't handle her anymore
and don't want to.

619
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,482
When could you come ?

620
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,684
That's fine by me.

621
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,682
No, it's best you tell her.

622
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,522
All right, thanks.

623
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,604
Goodbye, thanks.

624
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,845
Hi, mom.

625
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,962
Why so soon ?

626
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,689
But I didn't do anything.

627
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,889
I don't want to leave.

628
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,122
- Hi.
- Arianna isn't home.

629
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,647
- Will you tell her I came by?
- Yes.

630
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,126
Hi!

631
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:11,363
- How's the stain ?
- It hasn't come back yet.

632
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,442
I've been staying at my brother's,

633
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,687
I haven't seen my son in three days.

634
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,446
- I spoke to a psychiatrist.
- What did he say ?

635
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,809
That I need to convince her
to get help, but she'll never agree.

636
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:29,161
It would be easier for you
if there were a name for her condition,

637
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:33,327
but women's disorders
are more mysterious than men's.

638
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,564
They're not that easy to define.

639
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,329
Will you hug me ?

640
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,645
It's just a minor lapse, it'll pass.

641
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,245
Thanks.

642
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,365
Bye.

643
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:10,166
Shall we go ? It's getting cold.

644
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,565
Can't we stay a bit longer?
It's the last day.

645
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,642
Seems the gang has split up.

646
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:27,251
- He's not in the gang.
- He's always in the square with them.

647
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,602
- He doesn't like being with others.
- No ?

648
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,489
How do you know ?

649
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,124
I just know.

650
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:13,524
That boy must be in love with me.

651
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,204
Perhaps.

652
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,168
Have you ever been in love ?

653
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,528
Lots of times when I was a kid.

654
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:26,810
Then when I grew up, just once,
when I met my husband.

655
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,930
Did you talk to him ?

656
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,522
Of course, how else
would I have fallen in love with him ?

657
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,482
I don't think you need to talk
to fall in love.

658
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:51,200
True, it's not essential,
but it is preferable

659
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,840
so you can avoid nasty surprises.

660
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,649
You fall in love with someone
because you know him.

661
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,406
You don't know him by talking

662
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,804
but by looking,
one look and you know everything.

663
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,242
That never happened to me.

664
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,170
Maybe that's why I faced
some nasty surprises.

665
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,324
Good night.

666
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,081
Know where I'm taking you ?

667
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,124
Yes, I do.

668
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,969
And you're not afraid ?

669
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,485
No.

670
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,691
Hey, you're still in bed ?

671
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:51,490
Get dressed,
your mom will be here soon.

672
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,204
I had a dream.

673
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,768
ls that so ? A good or bad dream ?

674
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:12,325
A good dream, but I died in the end.

675
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,204
- Where is she ?
- In her room getting ready.

676
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:40,962
Do have any idea
what might have happened ?

677
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,049
- I thought I did.
- What did you think ?

678
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,924
You know,
last night Gea started dancing.

679
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,410
Okay. .-

680
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:57,965
When you asked where she'd been,
what did she say ?

681
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:02,529
- Out with the dog.
- For four hours ?

682
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,883
I'm sorry, it's my fault,
I'm not used to dealing with kids.

683
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,326
I don't understand them.

684
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,211
It's not your fault,
Gea is an odd kid.

685
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,769
You're her mom, she might tell you.

686
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,801
Perhaps, but I doubt it.

687
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,251
Thanks for everything, goodbye.

688
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,811
Goodbye.

689
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,841
It's time for us to say goodbye.

690
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,285
If that boy asks about me,

691
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,443
tell him I've left but I'll be back.

692
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,969
Okay, if he asks I'll tell him.

693
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:06,166
- I'm almost done.
- Take your time.

694
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,324
No need to rush.

695
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,969
She's always scurrying l

696
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,520
Your mom says
you dropped out of school.

697
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,011
Looking for work ?

698
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,962
Not really,
l take whatever comes along.

699
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:33,491
I have a small farm equipment company.

700
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,362
Nothing big,
but it involves lots of traveling,

701
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,208
even abroad,
and meeting lots of people.

702
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,968
Let me know if you're interested.

703
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:47,530
Thanks, but I don't like traveling.

704
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:53,331
How strange, at your age
most kids can't sit still l

705
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,409
- Want more coffee ?
- Yes, sure.

706
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,646
Thanks.

707
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,208
I have a son too.

708
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:25,123
I rarely see him, he lives in Belgium,
his name's Fabio.

709
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:27,847
All set.

710
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,490
I'll load the car.

711
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:33,803
Have Yuri give you hand,
I'll grab a few more things.

712
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,728
No need, I'll do it.

713
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,922
It was a pleasure to meet you.

714
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,241
Hope to see you soon. Bye.

715
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:59,450
- What do you think of him ?
- Dunno, we didn't talk much.

716
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,129
- Will you be okay alone ?
- Of course, I'm not a baby.

717
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:16,482
It's a just a vacation,
I'll be back here in a week.

718
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,007
Or sooner if I get bored.

719
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,448
Your pants are in the washer,
make sure to hang them out.

720
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,728
Okay, don't worry.

721
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,920
There are steaks in the freezer.

722
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:29,931
I've got a surprise for the old dude...
first and last time.

723
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,731
Hello l

724
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,566
Will you set them up ?
The mirror's on the table.

725
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,810
Know it ?

726
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:56,846
He's a legend, a traveler
who knew the world.

727
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:01,287
An untranslatable title:
"Os Cus de Judas".

728
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,484
In Italian it was translated as:
"Butt Fuck Nowhere".

729
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,805
Want to read it?

730
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:13,447
Oh right, you have no use
for reading, Hamlet.

731
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:17,524
You go to the School of Hard Knocks.

732
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,884
Good.

733
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,890
Found it.

734
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,806
The king of all drugs.

735
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,361
Just this time, never again.

736
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:40,691
This will be my last time.
I'm leaving, changing scenery.

737
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,490
Where to ?

738
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,367
I'm going to start traveling
like I used to.

739
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,406
Wouldn't you like to leave ?

740
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:55,282
Changing location won't change
who we are deep inside.

741
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:59,445
You've become a philosopher, Hamlet.

742
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,201
My name's Yuri.

743
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,241
We're nothing deep inside,

744
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:10,361
we're just full of ghosts
who've set up their lairs.

745
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,482
<i>She thought about those distant years</i>

746
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,530
<i>and it seemed that life
did not belong to her</i>

747
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:28,562
<i>but to someone else, with a different
name, a different destiny.</i>

748
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,285
Hey.

749
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,846
Hey.

750
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,401
Did you see the waves ?
Not going out?

751
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,009
Not today.

752
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:53,526
The others ?

753
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,650
Haven't heard from Mazinga in days
and Dora is missing.

754
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:02,006
- They're never in the square.
- They got scared shitless.

755
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,925
Speed it up,
you have another one waiting.

756
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,728
All right, see you.

757
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,687
Why'd you come looking for me ?

758
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,763
I was just passing by.

759
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,284
See you tonight ?

760
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,969
No, I've got stuff to do.

761
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,721
Hi, done with History homework ?

762
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:37,005
Yes, I just need to review.

763
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:33,130
- <i>Hello</i> ?
<i>- Have you seen that boy ?</i>

764
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:35,525
No.

765
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:38,570
<i>- He hasn't been in the square ?</i>
- I don't think <i>so.</i>

766
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:42,688
Remember,
if you see him tell him I left.

767
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,606
<i>Of course.</i>

768
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,924
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Good night.

769
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,088
Hello.

770
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:30,120
