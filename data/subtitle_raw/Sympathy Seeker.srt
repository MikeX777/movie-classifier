1
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,000
A Vladimir Mashkov film

2
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:28,316
An Orphan of Kazan.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,534
Dedicated to all moms and dads.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,450
“Cold frost and sunshine…”

5
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,650
Well? Continue.

6
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,709
Why are you quiet? Cold frost and sunshine, then?

7
00:01:26,802 --> 00:01:29,000
- Anastasya Pavlovna…
- What?

8
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,700
Have you ever been to Kazan?

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,550
No. Why?

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Then why does my mom say you are an orphan of Kazan?

11
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,700
Well... You see...

12
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:50,576
That’s an expression. That’s what they say about a person who doesn’t have any relatives.

13
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:55,100
My mother died, and I don’t have anyone besides her.

14
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,300
Is your father dead as well?

15
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,300
- I don’t know. I’ve never seen him.
- How so?

16
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,311
Well, you see…

17
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:09,900
Listen, Demendeev, why are you here – to ask questions? Read the poem.

18
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,600
“Cold frost and sunshine:
Day...”

19
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:20,350
Right, what day is it?

20
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,500
- What day is it outside?
- 31st of December.

21
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,500
That’s the date, but the day? What day is it outside?

22
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:35,650
- A good one.
- That’s right, but not a good one – “of wonder”. Carry on.

23
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,000
- “But you…” do what?
- What?

24
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,850
“…my friend, are still in slumber”.

25
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,700
Just like you, Demendeev, but you’re not in slumber, just straight up asleep.
Did you learn it or not?

26
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:54,000
- I did.
- Then read it.

27
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,400
Right, let’s do it together.

28
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,800
“Wake up, my beauty, time belies”.
- Belies.

29
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,850
- “You dormant eyes, I beg you, broaden”.
- Broaden.

30
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,750
“Toward the northerly Aurora,
As though a northern star…” does what?

31
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:19,238
Pies.

32
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,430
- Arise!
- Arise.

33
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,000
See, you can do it when you want to.

34
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,600
Go make your parents happy, say I gave you a 3.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,100
Also, wish them a Happy New Year from me.

36
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:40,003
- Put your hat on!
- Thank you!

37
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,850
Fyodor Mikhailovich, I’m out!

38
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,300
- Happy New Year!
- Thank you, likewise.

39
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:22,000
Anastasya Pavlovna, the key!

40
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:56,000
- Anastasya Pavlovna, you forgot your bag.
- Oh, thank you.

41
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:57,714
Happy New Year.

42
00:06:09,795 --> 00:06:12,400
Happy New Year, Anastasya Pavlovna.

43
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,729
Nastya!

44
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,000
The carriage’s at the entrance, as they say. Why aren’t you dressed?

45
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,500
Why are we in a hurry?

46
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,807
Well, “why”?

47
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:53,000
We leave at five, it’ll be six when we arrive, also we need to get some gifts at seven.

48
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:57,381
It’ll be twelve before you know it.

49
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:06,800
Nastya! I’m thinking, should I put a tie on?

50
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,494
I took some from Fedya.

51
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,956
Kolya, maybe we should stay?

52
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,100
What do you mean? Are you out of your mind?

53
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,500
Don't be angry.

54
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,500
I’ve called up all the relatives to look at you, and you want to stay!

55
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,074
- What is there to look at me?
- What do you mean? Are you my fiancee or not?

56
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,800
- I am.
- Maybe you don’t want to marry me either?

57
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,700
- I do.
- Then let’s go!

58
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,522
Do you love me?

59
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,800
What does this have to do with it? Yeah, I do.

60
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:48,000
- And without the “yeah”?
- I do.

61
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,600
Then let's stay.

62
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,502
Let's.

63
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,012
Nastya, what are we going to do here?

64
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,300
The TV doesn’t work here, but over at my place, they’ve put up the tree, were setting up the table for three days straight.

65
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:14,842
And here? No champagne even.

66
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I have a tree, although it’s plastic; I’ve bought champagne.

67
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,839
I see.

68
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:37,600
- That’s our first New Year, after all.
- So we will meet it together, like a family, and go visiting tomorrow.

69
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,600
Where are you going?

70
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,350
“Where”? To get champagne.

71
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,000
Wait!

72
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,225
Now you can go.

73
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,767
Look at that!

74
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,097
Kolya!

75
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,000
You’re here already? Come in.

76
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,959
Good evening.

77
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,573
Happy New Year.

78
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,651
Likewise.

79
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,613
This is for you.

80
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,716
Thank you.

81
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,325
Goodbye.

82
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,600
Excuse me, who are you?

83
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,350
Didn’t I say?

84
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,500
No.

85
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,758
I... I came...

86
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,369
I came because of this letter in the newspaper.

87
00:11:06,684 --> 00:11:07,684
I'm Pavel.

88
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,880
I forgot the money.

89
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,131
I said, I forgot the money.

90
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,516
Nikolay.

91
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,689
Pavel Ottovich Brumel.

92
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:36,098
My father.

93
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:50,710
Nastya, can I have you for a minute? For a minute.

94
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,600
Excuse me, I'll be back.

95
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,500
- Who's this?
- My father.

96
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:15,100
- Where did he come from?
- He’d read the letter.

97
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,350
- What letter?
- Mom’s letter, the unsent one.

98
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,771
- You told me it had no address.
- Kolya, I sent it to the newspaper and they’ve published it.

99
00:12:23,406 --> 00:12:26,406
- Why?
- Don't you get it?

100
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,037
- Why? I get it.
- Kolya!

101
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:31,300
- It doesn’t even state his last name!
- Yes.

102
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,900
Just the name! "Pavel", so what? What does this prove?

103
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,700
- There are things in the letter that only…
- Did you see his passport?

104
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,092
There are things in the letter that only two people could’ve known.

105
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,000
Nastya!

106
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,200
He came here, you understand? That proves everything.

107
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,435
Wait!

108
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,484
More tea?

109
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,869
Yes. Thank you.

110
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,750
I better go.

111
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:12,395
Sorry.

112
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:19,604
I’ve… been waiting for you letter for so long.

113
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,700
Really?

114
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,533
I did write it.

115
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,800
As soon as I’ve read that letter in the paper.

116
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,450
Then I’ve read my letter and tore it.

117
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,400
I thought, why make up excuses after so many years?

118
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,822
Decided to come here.

119
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:41,300
I didn’t want to disturb you, I thought I’d just take a look and leave.

120
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,400
But then I saw you there near the school, and you look so much like Galya...

121
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:50,850
I realised I’m not leaving just like that.

122
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:52,689
Silly, isn't it?

123
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,000
No, it’s not silly at all.

124
00:14:57,544 --> 00:15:04,000
If only you knew how worried I was! What if they wouldn’t publish it, or you wouldn’t read it,

125
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:07,700
or maybe you have a happy family, children…

126
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,450
Don’t worry, I don’t have anyone.

127
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,700
Imagine: Sochi, the palms, the sea.

128
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,500
I still remember it: I wore white sailor trousers, and a matching white jacket…

129
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,800
…that you tore when you were climbing over a fence to steal flowers.

130
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,158
How do you know?

131
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,980
The letter.

132
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,200
Has your mother really not told you anything about me?

133
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,540
When I was a child, she joked about finding me inside a cabbage.

134
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:05,500
When I grew up, she only once said: “Your father is a really good man. It just did not work out”.

135
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,540
Yes, it didn't.

136
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,900
For six days I was flying as if I had wings, doing incredible nonsense,

137
00:16:13,242 --> 00:16:17,000
and then she just hopped on a train and left.

138
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,650
Didn’t even say goodbye. Usually men do that.

139
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,400
But on the other hand, what could I give her?

140
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:33,450
Become a wife of a circus performer? Live in a tiny van, move from town to town?

141
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,893
You’re a circus performer?

142
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,300
Yes, a magician.

143
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,344
A real one?

144
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:44,150
A real one. Although retired.

145
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,000
- Nikolay.
- My fiance.

146
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:08,606
Pavel, no need for the patronymic.

147
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:15,345
Nastya, I forgot the money.

148
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,500
I’ll go get champagne then, it’s not every day that fathers show up.

149
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,800
I mean, are found.

150
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,000
Well, arrive.

151
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,899
- I better go.
- Wait.

152
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,725
Now go.

153
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,650
We can go to my family in the district center. Huh?

154
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,400
You’ll get acquainted then. You’re the father, after all.

155
00:17:57,795 --> 00:18:01,640
- So, should we?
- Well, it’s a bit awkward.

156
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,440
- What’s awkward?
- Don’t shout.

157
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,500
I’m not shouting. I see you two want to talk, after so many years.

158
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,670
Well, you’ll get enough of that soon, there’s a whole life ahead.

159
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,470
It’s New Year today. You said so yourself – “like a family”.

160
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:19,550
I’m not really dressed up for the occasion.

161
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:23,250
I’ll give you a tie. Got a dozen of these.

162
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:27,550
Are we going empty-handed?

163
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,952
Why empty-handed? You dress up and I’ll go to Fedya.

164
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:34,095
Let's go?

165
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:35,492
Let's.

166
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:00,000
FYODOR'S

167
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,145
Thank you.

168
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:37,500
I forgot how a properly ironed shirt looks like.

169
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,500
I’ve never learned how to tie a tie, after all.

170
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,700
You’re handsome either way.

171
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,313
What?

172
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:52,200
You are the second person in my life who'd said that.

173
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:55,638
Mother was the first one?

174
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,700
What’s wrong? Did I upset you?

175
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,000
Nothing, it’s just…

176
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,600
I’ve been waiting for you for so long.

177
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,003
Happy New Year.

178
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,500
- Is this house 11?
- 11.

179
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,100
- Are you Nastya?
- Nastya.

180
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,500
Well...

181
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,800
Hello, daughter.

182
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
We’ve met at last, as they say.

183
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,200
Were you not expecting me?

184
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,200
Or are you not happy?

185
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,550
And I went across half the country, so to say, straight from Kazakhstan.

186
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:19,600
First on a plane, then on a train, then two hitchhikes.

187
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,009
You probably haven't received my wire?

188
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,491
No.

189
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,200
These guys! Oh well, it’s New Year, after all.

190
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,469
This is for you.

191
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,000
Well, let’s get acquainted on the occasion.

192
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,500
Pavel Andreevich Koveshnikov, a cosmonaut, lieutenant colonel in retirement, Nastya’s father.

193
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:25,300
We can go straight to informal, I like it simple.

194
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:31,150
A colleague or a relative?

195
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:36,400
That's my father.

196
00:22:40,512 --> 00:22:42,512
I don't get it.

197
00:22:45,443 --> 00:22:47,443
There’s a little discrepancy.

198
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,944
What discrepancy?

199
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:52,000
- Are you Nastya?
- Nastya.

200
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:57,000
- Was it you who published this letter in the paper?
- Me.

201
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,264
- Asking for a reply?
- Yes.

202
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,000
- Gave your address?
- Yes.

203
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,389
So here I am.

204
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,400
Pavel Andreevich Koveshnikov, a cosmonaut, lieutenant colonel in retirement.

205
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:08,717
Your father.

206
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:13,833
Pavel?

207
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:15,219
Pavel.

208
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:18,600
My father?

209
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,400
Your father.

210
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,600
Hold up, there is a misunderstanding.

211
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,200
- Of course, you must be mistaken somewhere.
- No, first of all, stop with the informalities.

212
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,700
- Apologies.
- Second of all, I too am Pavel.

213
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:40,000
Pavel Ottovich Brumel. I am a magician, and also an honoured worker of art, by the way.

214
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,500
- Let's assume so.
- Third of all, I am not mistaken anywhere.

215
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:46,400
- 29 years ago… you are 29, right?
- Will be.

216
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:47,885
Will be.

217
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:55,400
So, 29 years ago, 14th of July, in a “Sunny” hotel,

218
00:23:55,448 --> 00:24:00,000
I have met a charming woman named Galya, this girl’s mother.

219
00:24:00,032 --> 00:24:06,500
We got along during breakfast in our canteen, then Galya and I had a romance, with Nastya appearing as a result,

220
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,500
the existence of whom I could not have known about all these years because Galya never knew my address.

221
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:13,669
- That’s all?
- That’s all.

222
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,429
Sit down, then.

223
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:20,200
Well, if you give me paperwork, I’ll reply with paperwork too.

224
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:25,000
Let’s open my military ID,

225
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:31,400
and read this entry on 2nd of July 1968. Let’s open it, c’mon.

226
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:39,200
Let’s read: “For the successful flight and the wit displayed in an unforeseen situation,

227
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:45,600
Captain Koveshnikov P.A. to be awarded with a Medal of Excellent Military- and Political Training,

228
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,500
and to be given an out of queue holiday of 3 weeks”.

229
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:57,900
And… and the signature, Colonel Dvoinikov. Here.

230
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,000
- So what?
- So that.

231
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:16,850
That on 4th of July, I was sitting on the balcony of the “Sunny” hotel in white sailor trousers and a matching jacket,

232
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:23,500
eating ice cream that cost 11 kopeeks, which was written down in my holiday book.

233
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:24,957
I can present it.

234
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:32,500
And in the evening of the same day, I was dancing tango with the most beautiful lady on the coast.

235
00:25:33,044 --> 00:25:36,600
Her name was Galya.

236
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,200
Your mother.

237
00:25:48,002 --> 00:25:50,002
- A husband?
- A fiance, Kolya.

238
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,600
Let’s say hi then, fiance.

239
00:25:55,524 --> 00:26:02,400
Pavel Andreevich Koveshnikov, a cosmonaut, lieutenant colonel in retirement.

240
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:06,133
- Your future father-in-law, so to say.
- Who?

241
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,601
Father-in-law.

242
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,400
- What’s going on here?
- Kolya…

243
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,200
I’m Kolya alright, who is he?

244
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,100
That’s Pavel.

245
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,304
Another one.

246
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,450
- Put your coat on real quick.
- Kolya!

247
00:26:29,499 --> 00:26:31,499
Put it on, I said.

248
00:26:46,327 --> 00:26:49,700
- Kolya, just don’t get angry, I’ll explain everything.
- C’mon, I’m waiting.

249
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,700
You see, he’d read the letter too.

250
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,600
- And he also claims to be your father?
- Yes.

251
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,700
- And you believe him?
- Well… everything matches there as well.

252
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,000
- What everything?
- Everything!

253
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:08,000
Here, I’m showing you, it’s written very clearly: “Dear Pavel”, that’s me – one!

254
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:10,900
The “Sunny” hotel, that’s a no-brainer – two!

255
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:16,000
Then the promenade. Galya and I were walking there once, and a big sailing ship passed by – three!

256
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:21,100
The white Indian jacket that got stolen two years later – four!

257
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,000
The “Shroom” cafe and the milkshake – five!

258
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:27,700
Well? Give up?

259
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,700
By the way, I haven’t seen your documents yet.

260
00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:38,000
Please understand, you can’t find a person just by his name.

261
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:41,000
It’s impossible to remember all the details after 30 years either!

262
00:27:41,164 --> 00:27:44,350
- But they were in love.
- Who?
- Mother and father.

263
00:27:44,528 --> 00:27:48,000
- 30 years have passed, do you understand that?
- Kolya.
- What?

264
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,092
Do you love me?

265
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,757
- What does it have to do with it? Yeah, I do.
- And without the “yeah”?

266
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:55,181
I do.

267
00:27:55,501 --> 00:28:00,501
So if I don’t marry you, you won’t even remember me in 30 years’ time?

268
00:28:01,086 --> 00:28:07,500
How you used to court me, how you entered my class through the window on the 3rd of September and kissed me while the kids cheered?

269
00:28:07,705 --> 00:28:11,000
- That’s totally different.
- No it’s not, Kolya.

270
00:28:11,013 --> 00:28:14,750
I don’t know which one is my father, but I feel that both of them are telling the truth!

271
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,200
- Nastya!
- I’m cold.

272
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,441
Kolya!

273
00:28:25,345 --> 00:28:29,000
Hey, fathers! Stop that! Drop it!

274
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,300
- I’ll kill you!
- A fistfight is all I need now!

275
00:28:31,423 --> 00:28:33,690
Roll outside and fight there!

276
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,300
- I’m not going anywhere!
- Me neither!

277
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:40,000
- Ah, maybe you need some help?
- Kolya, don't!

278
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:41,500
Be quiet!

279
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,200
Just you look at that, they won’t leave!

280
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,600
Who asked you to come in the first place?

281
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:55,000
Been gone for 30 years and now jumped out like two jacks in a box: “Here I am, love me!”

282
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,500
- Stop!
- What, am I wrong?

283
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,008
Why are you staring?

284
00:29:04,664 --> 00:29:05,800
Kolya, be quiet.

285
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:09,500
Let him talk.

286
00:29:11,678 --> 00:29:15,000
C’mon, finish me off, son.

287
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,118
You’re asking, who wanted me here?

288
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,300
Nastya wanted me here.

289
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,900
So it’s not up to you to judge me,

290
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,250
and not up to you to decide.

291
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,700
You were not even born

292
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,606
when I was playing volleyball with Yura Gagarin.

293
00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:45,300
And if I wronged my daughter somewhere,

294
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:53,200
then it’s only when I’ve never received that letter 30 years ago.

295
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,000
Just say it, daughter,

296
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:01,100
and I'll leave.

297
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
May I?

298
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,546
Here I am!

299
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,150
I came from a kind tale, let’s have fun and not be stale!

300
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,550
Let’s all gather over there and have a wonderful New Year!

301
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,800
- I will give your moods a lift by bringing each of you a gift!
- Fedya, is that you?

302
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,009
Bourgeoise are saying oui!

303
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,665
They love some freckles and good beer!

304
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:26,000
And you sit up and look high up!

305
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:38,651
And you’ve got no appetite – better take some streptocite!

306
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,300
And this is for you.

307
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,000
Father?

308
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,535
You recognised me.

309
00:32:17,743 --> 00:32:20,743
FYODOR'S

310
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,550
So that’s how it came about.

311
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,650
So, you didn’t even ask her last name?

312
00:32:56,708 --> 00:33:00,400
Did you? I was looking into her eyes, not into her passport.

313
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,949
I have my doubts.

314
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:04,900
Listen, what’s your…. honestly, I-

315
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,750
To you, it’s Pavel Andreevich Koveshnikov, a cosmonaut, lieutenant colonel in retirement, I can show my documents.

316
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,000
- Why do I need your documents?
- Don’t pay attention to him.
- Why do you mean “don’t pay attention”?

317
00:33:12,088 --> 00:33:15,088
Please don’t quarrel, I beg you.

318
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:27,000
So I hopped in a taxi and went back to the hotel,

319
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,800
said, you had a woman at your place, Galya!

320
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:40,200
And there’s this red-faced administrator, saying, we’re not an inquiry office here, sort it out yourself.

321
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
So I sorted him out.

322
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:49,000
Enlightened him straight in the face, but the police was there too,

323
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,708
they released me two days later.

324
00:33:54,100 --> 00:34:00,301
And when I reached the port, they said that’s it, your white ship’s gone.

325
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,500
Well, you can guess what it’s like to miss your own ship.

326
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,100
So they wrote me off, that’s the story.

327
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:15,210
Then I became a cook on a seiner.

328
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,600
Didn’t Galya tell you anything about me?

329
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,100
I thought so.

330
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,000
She probably thought I just never showed up.

331
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,700
Demendeev, what do you want?

332
00:34:55,387 --> 00:35:00,900
That’s for you. Mom told me to wish you a Happy New Year and thank you for that 3.

333
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,400
- What is this?
- A cake.

334
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:06,809
Although I fell over a little, it’s slippery out there.

335
00:35:08,444 --> 00:35:10,800
Here are the candles to it.

336
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:17,600
They also say your pops arrived, so I came to take a look.

337
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,660
It’s interesting, after all.

338
00:35:20,694 --> 00:35:22,650
So, which one is the pops?

339
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,803
Me!

340
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,200
I better come tomorrow.

341
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,300
Is the photo a match for you too, then?

342
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,800
Did you show them the photo?

343
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,594
No.

344
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,500
Do any of you have mother’s photo?

345
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,400
There we go!

346
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,177
We’re all here guessing, torturing ourselves. Why didn’t you say sooner?

347
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,800
C’mon, daughter, bring the photo in. Let’s sort it out.

348
00:36:14,223 --> 00:36:18,223
- Bring it.
- I know I’m not thinking straight coming from the frost, but you two?

349
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,600
Just a moment.

350
00:37:32,028 --> 00:37:35,500
Kolya, I completely forgot.

351
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,700
You took it with you.

352
00:37:43,236 --> 00:37:45,000
Where did I take it?

353
00:37:45,836 --> 00:37:46,836
To the district center.

354
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,000
Why?

355
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,000
To enlarge it to make mother’s portrait.

356
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,537
When?

357
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:03,524
Well, you know better when you took it. Hopped on your tractor and took it.

358
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,368
Remember?

359
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,370
Yeah.

360
00:38:07,938 --> 00:38:11,600
Go there and bring it back, then.

361
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,663
What, right now?

362
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,200
Sure. It’s not far.

363
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,000
- Not far.
- So go get it, then.

364
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,800
- I'll go then?
- Go.

365
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,300
So you’re both Pavels?

366
00:39:33,107 --> 00:39:35,500
And both decided that…

367
00:39:36,525 --> 00:39:38,525
I don’t see anything funny.

368
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,189
I can't!

369
00:39:48,647 --> 00:39:50,200
So you’re a cosmonaut?

370
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,200
I am, I am.

371
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
- And you went into space?
- I did.

372
00:39:56,698 --> 00:40:00,000
- I don’t recite your name though, what year was that?
- Whichever it had to be.

373
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,746
By the way,

374
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:08,950
I ask you to stop with informalities.

375
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,400
You like it simple though, you told me yourself.

376
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,500
Your face seems familiar.

377
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,300
Was it you entertaining folks in a bar in Novorossiysk?

378
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,166
No, oh no.

379
00:40:19,974 --> 00:40:21,500
I think you were showing tricks.

380
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:26,000
Brumel, you’re a magician! An honoured worker of art!

381
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
There are many magicians out there!

382
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:40,500
- Nastya, can I wash my face after the journey?
- Of course, I’ll give you a towel.

383
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,500
By the way, my dear, you were going on about documents, so here’s my document.

384
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:52,600
You can’t erase that one. Here’s the sea for you, and the palms, and Galya.

385
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:55,231
GAGRA-69 GALYA

386
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,300
Got it?

387
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,914
Hold up.

388
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,800
But it says “Gagra-69”.

389
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,900
So what?

390
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,900
So that! It wasn’t in Gagra, it was Sochi.

391
00:41:10,657 --> 00:41:12,657
I met Galya in Sochi.

392
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:17,000
You maybe met her in Sochi, but I met her in Gagra.

393
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,545
And you?

394
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,637
Well?

395
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,400
Ah, here.

396
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:41,500
"From 4.07 to 24.07.1969, hotel “Sunny”,

397
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,900
city of Yalta".

398
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,249
I knew it.

399
00:41:45,509 --> 00:41:48,000
I felt it. Felt it!

400
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,600
Nastya, do you believe me now?

401
00:41:52,213 --> 00:41:54,150
Now you know who your father is?

402
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,900
It was in Sochi. I met your mother in Sochi.

403
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,900
She was in Sochi, was she?

404
00:42:02,207 --> 00:42:03,207
I don't know.

405
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,500
I brought a little tree for you.

406
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:26,618
My god, Kolya, where’ve you been?

407
00:42:27,854 --> 00:42:28,854
In the district center.

408
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,800
Where did you get so drunk?

409
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:35,552
In the photo studio.

410
00:42:36,414 --> 00:42:40,414
You saent me there yourself… sent.

411
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,200
They said...

412
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,000
They said,

413
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,400
there’s no photo, but will be later.

414
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,332
Are you three free?

415
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:09,500
Can you walk past two houses over there with me?

416
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:17,329
I made a bet with Fedya that I have three fathers-in-law, but he doesn’t believe me.

417
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:28,000
I told him, c’mon, I’ll show you. So we can even make money from this.

418
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,000
- Kolya!
- What?

419
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,639
Go somewhere again? To the center?

420
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,200
And I almost believed you.

421
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,500
And you too, almost.

422
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:54,088
Your crying too, Ded Moroz, was pretty believable.

423
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,639
He usually never drinks.

424
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,000
You’re all good guys,

425
00:44:03,063 --> 00:44:06,400
but two of you are lying.

426
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,300
Kolya, you don’t understand.

427
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,000
It’s important that they understood me.

428
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:17,793
Decided to make themselves a summer house here.

429
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,200
No wonder, what else do you need at this age? Right, fathers?

430
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:31,381
Kolya, get out, please get out. Get yourself sorted and put the tree back.

431
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,720
See!

432
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:42,000
She told none of you to leave, only me.

433
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:47,200
I'll leave alright.

434
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,823
But will I return?

435
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,500
That's the big question.

436
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,000
Do you also think that?

437
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,639
I think...

438
00:45:31,508 --> 00:45:34,000
I think, how I am going to feed you all?

439
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,200
I've got nothing.

440
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,000
What do you mean, nothing?

441
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,700
So, your newspaper reached me all the way in Japan, in Yakagama.

442
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,000
Thanks to the guys, they bought me a ticket.

443
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,788
To Vladivostok by a plane, and then it was a question of details.

444
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
- Why are you wailing?
- The onions.

445
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,500
Not a drop from me, you know!

446
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,157
I've cried it all out!

447
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:57,000
I once did some math and gasped: in all my life, I have cleaned and chopped 17 tons of onions!

448
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,500
How much? 17 tons?

449
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,000
That’s the weight of the first stage of a launch vehicle.

450
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,000
You can lie, but don’t get lost in it.

451
00:47:05,012 --> 00:47:08,012
Koveshnikov, keep wielding and stop eavesdropping.

452
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,550
Be like Brumel.

453
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,129
I have something too, by the way.

454
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,000
Space food.

455
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,459
Ukrainian borsch.

456
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,167
Beef Stroganoff.

457
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:31,700
Chicken Kiev.

458
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,500
Chocolate marmalade.

459
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,200
You can seal windows with this grease alright.

460
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,200
Today we have a festive menu.

461
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:51,587
Appetisers: chilled mussels in lemon sauce, bird fondue in pineapple and paprika sauce.

462
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:56,450
Main course: fish with bacon, South-French chicken, and the desert:

463
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:02,350
cocktail “Pineapple glaze”, and pancakes with orange syrup.

464
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,450
Any questions?

465
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,500
Since when do they feed you like that in the navy?

466
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:09,000
Since today, bros.

467
00:48:13,598 --> 00:48:16,598
- Can I have the marmalade?
- Of course!

468
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,974
Nastya, I don’t recommend you eat that.

469
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,100
Listen, Brumel, why are you always butting in? Keep hanging up the baubles in peace.

470
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,900
- I am.
- You are. Splendid.

471
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,000
Eat, daughter, before that contraption is ready.

472
00:48:36,552 --> 00:48:38,552
Is it really going to work?

473
00:48:38,794 --> 00:48:41,000
You’re insulting me!

474
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,100
Of course it’s not the same as hanging up baubles, or chopping little onions,

475
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,339
but I’m old friends with tech.

476
00:48:51,891 --> 00:48:53,891
Nastya, where’s salt in our house?

477
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,211
One moment.

478
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:00,100
Thank you.

479
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,594
- Nastya, where are the lights in our house?
- Ah, hold on.

480
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,900
- Do you need help?
- Please.

481
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,262
Nastya, where are the pliers in our house?

482
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,200
Oh, they were somewhere… wher- hold on.

483
00:49:30,279 --> 00:49:31,279
Guys,

484
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,200
here's a proposal.

485
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,600
I propose to declare a truce till the morning.

486
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:53,000
If it wasn’t for Nastya, who knows where we would have been celebrating this New Year. Therefore I propose to drink after her.

487
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,402
Please cast your votes by cheering and drinking.

488
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,000
After Nastya.

489
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:33,900
Huh… Life sure has a peculiar sense of humour.

490
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,849
I thought nothing could surprise me anymore, I’ve seen it all.

491
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,850
I've accomplished something in my life, this and that – but then I’ve read the letter and…

492
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,100
felt like somebody poured boiling water over me.

493
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,700
You can’t lie to yourself – nothing was ever accomplished,

494
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:58,000
if I dropped everything like that and ran here.

495
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:01,000
My mother used to cook so well,

496
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,400
especially Ukrainian borsch.

497
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:09,000
I used to invite all my friends for that borsch, we had a giant flat, a big oak table in the dining room,

498
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:11,600
with a hanging fringed lampshade.

499
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,402
Why the past tense? Is the flat not there anymore?

500
00:51:15,571 --> 00:51:17,571
The flat is there, but I’m not.

501
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,989
I’ve never had my own flat.

502
00:51:20,493 --> 00:51:21,550
Here’s my flat.

503
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,000
There’s the bedroom, the living room, and the fringed lampshade, but I don’t regret it.

504
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:29,463
I don't.

505
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:34,100
I’ve read the letter and thought: huh.

506
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,000
Everything happens for a reason.

507
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:41,500
Where did the daughter go, I’ll go check.

508
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,200
- I’m with you.
- Me too.

509
00:51:44,725 --> 00:51:47,200
- Nastya!
- Where have you been?
- We are worried.

510
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,600
Attention!

511
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,500
I'm turning it on.

512
00:53:12,162 --> 00:53:13,300
It works!

513
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,484
Who is this?

514
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:29,000
That’s an announcement from the American president to the American people.

515
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,397
Satellite.

516
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,600
Is there anything in Russian?

517
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,800
Yeah...

518
00:53:35,692 --> 00:53:36,692
Huh!

519
00:53:42,442 --> 00:53:45,442
Kolya, where have you been? We’re all waiting for you!

520
00:53:45,875 --> 00:53:49,500
Planted the tree, bought champagne, got cold.

521
00:53:49,762 --> 00:53:54,000
- Please forgive me.
- Take your clothes off and go to bed!

522
00:53:54,093 --> 00:53:56,800
- He’ll get ill.
- We need to rub him with alcohol, undress him.

523
00:54:00,501 --> 00:54:01,501
- Quick!
- On the sofa.

524
00:54:02,424 --> 00:54:06,424
- Careful.
- Take the shirt off, the boots too.

525
00:54:07,553 --> 00:54:09,553
Careful.

526
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,418
Am I going to celebrate New Year naked?

527
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,100
Hold on, man, hold on.

528
00:54:21,764 --> 00:54:23,764
Here, great!

529
00:54:24,092 --> 00:54:25,900
- Maybe we should rub him with pee?
- What?

530
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:29,800
We were taught this in case of extreme temperatures.

531
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,300
- So what, does it help?
- It does.
- Rub him!

532
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,700
Nastya!

533
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,000
I understand you now.

534
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,800
Here's the New Year.

535
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
What are we waiting for?

536
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,705
Get the drinks!

537
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,770
- We'll be late.
- C'mon.

538
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:15,383
- Typical!
- C'mon, guys.

539
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,583
- Oh, thank god.
- For you too.

540
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,643
Happy New Year!

541
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,122
That’s not all!

542
00:56:09,012 --> 00:56:10,012
Sit down!

543
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,904
Stop it!

544
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,200
So I’m standing there on someone’s balcony with just my pants on.

545
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,900
I realise I have to sing!

546
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
- What did you sing?
- What else could I do?

547
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,300
- What did you sing though?
- Tango.

548
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,028
"Tell me why".

549
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,141
- “Yesterday we’ve met…”
- Wait.

550
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:48,500
“Yesterday we’ve met by chance,

551
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:51,520
And you gazed at me,

552
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:56,600
I looked at you with hidden sadness.

553
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It completely fogged my eyes!

554
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,300
Memories came down upon me,

555
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:08,600
The shadow of the past flickered in my eyes,

556
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:13,000
And a feeling of tender confession

557
00:57:13,198 --> 00:57:16,198
Was revived in my memory!

558
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,663
Tell me, why,

559
00:57:18,992 --> 00:57:23,500
Were we separated?

560
00:57:23,962 --> 00:57:31,000
Why did you leave me at once?

561
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:40,105
I know you loved me

562
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:48,000
But you left, tell me, why?”.

563
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,300
- Don't sleep!
- I'm not.

564
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,943
Just thinking.

565
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,000
- Where are the dads?
- Smoking.

566
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:33,000
Arguing about who do I look like the most. Thank you.

567
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:36,000
- For what?
- For helping me with the photos.

568
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:40,400
That’s alright, I understand. But tomorrow…

569
00:59:40,565 --> 00:59:43,565
Tomorrow will be tomorrow.

570
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,900
I'm telling you, wait! Nastya!

571
00:59:53,185 --> 00:59:54,400
Do like this.

572
01:00:03,655 --> 01:00:04,655
See!

573
01:00:05,006 --> 01:00:08,200
Only Brumels could do this trick on the first try.

574
01:00:10,001 --> 01:00:12,001
That proves nothing!

575
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,368
A problem and a question should be resolved on a genetic level.

576
01:00:15,489 --> 01:00:19,700
For example, did you know that a good vestibular apparatus is inherited in the family?

577
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:22,005
- Nonsense!
- A fact!

578
01:00:22,257 --> 01:00:23,600
- Nastya, come here!
- Pasha!

579
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:28,100
- Hold on. Hands! Feet shoulder width apart!

580
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,199
- Let's work, Nastya!
- What are you-

581
01:00:32,513 --> 01:00:36,513
work work work work work work work

582
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,694
What did you do to her?

583
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:02,530
Are you thinking straight or what?

584
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,100
I just wanted...

585
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,900
That’s alright, it’ll pass.

586
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,356
Kolya, let’s get some fresh air.

587
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,054
Be back soon.

588
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,763
I would love to smack you right now.

589
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:30,200
Must be true what they say about you cosmonauts and your brains delayering on the centrifuge.

590
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,700
- So what?
- How is she?
- Bad, right?

591
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,100
You know who you are?

592
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,300
You're no fathers.

593
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,696
You know why?

594
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,600
Because you’re almost grandfathers.

595
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:13,200
Well, from this moment now on, the guys are only allowed to smoke outside.

596
01:02:13,513 --> 01:02:16,600
And you should only be drinking juice.

597
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:22,100
I give a word to Nikolay, the father of our future grandchild.

598
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:25,318
- I would like a granddaughter.
- I would like you to keep quiet.

599
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:28,100
Please, Nikolay.

600
01:02:32,981 --> 01:02:34,981
I don’t speak well,

601
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,700
I’ll just kiss her and she’ll understand.

602
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:47,500
And to you I want you say this: Fedya had lost the bet.

603
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:50,511
I do indeed have three fathers-in-law.

604
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,508
And all three are sitting at this table.

605
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:57,000
Well, it might be old-fashioned and all,

606
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:04,000
but I want to ask all three of you for your daughter’s hand. Yeah.

607
01:03:04,659 --> 01:03:06,200
Well, fathers?

608
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,000
What are your thoughts?

609
01:03:09,174 --> 01:03:11,174
This is a serious business.

610
01:03:11,586 --> 01:03:13,100
We need to think.

611
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,900
Do you drink?

612
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,200
He doesn’t drink at all.

613
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,000
- Smoke?
- I do, but I can quit.

614
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,000
You'll have to.

615
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,250
Where are you going to live?

616
01:03:26,566 --> 01:03:27,566
Here.

617
01:03:28,666 --> 01:03:30,666
So you don’t have an apartment of your own.

618
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,538
Well, here for now, and then I want to build a house.

619
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:37,200
He is very good, you just don’t know him.

620
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:42,000
He left the city just for me, lives here alone on the edge of the village.

621
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:48,300
He’s been courting me for an entire year now, and I’ve been asking him to come live with me, but he says no, only after the wedding.

622
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,249
So what?

623
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,154
I’m not against it.

624
01:03:54,829 --> 01:03:55,980
Me neither, actually.

625
01:03:56,679 --> 01:03:58,500
But I’m totally… for.

626
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
One can get a heart attack like this.

627
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
- When’s the wedding?
- We were thinking about spring holidays.

628
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:19,600
Why stall? The groom is here, the bride is in stock, the table is full, a whole bunch of relatives are here.

629
01:04:19,965 --> 01:04:20,965
Kiss!

630
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,355
Wait.

631
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,200
What about presents from the parents’ side? After me.

632
01:04:36,176 --> 01:04:39,176
- Stop shaking.
- I'm not shaking.

633
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,700
Vitya! Let's go!

634
01:06:40,241 --> 01:06:41,241
I'm coming!

635
01:06:42,343 --> 01:06:44,343
God damn you.

636
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:50,913
That's not all.

637
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:57,000
Finally, I saw the station and began the docking procedure.

638
01:06:57,572 --> 01:06:59,000
I feel we’re off.

639
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:02,478
I go left – it’s heeling.

640
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:06,000
I tried going straight – going straight, going straight, - I am straight.

641
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,200
We’re getting closer.

642
01:07:08,602 --> 01:07:13,400
I see my speed is above the maximum, and the distance is this much – critical.

643
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:16,200
I turn the engine on, hit the brakes.

644
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,665
Suddenly, depressurization hits.

645
01:07:22,853 --> 01:07:28,000
I get a knock on the illuminator, they show me the watch – that means time’s up, and…

646
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:32,100
Wait. Who knocked on your illuminator in outer space?

647
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,700
- Who knocked?
- I’m asking you. Who?

648
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:38,000
- Where?
- The illuminator.

649
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,500
- Where?
- In space.

650
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,500
Did you fly or did you not?

651
01:07:46,786 --> 01:07:47,950
Pasha, tell the truth.

652
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:49,387
We’re all reliable here.

653
01:07:52,551 --> 01:07:54,000
Fine, I didn't.

654
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
But!

655
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:10,800
If they put me in the cabin even in my state right now,

656
01:08:10,907 --> 01:08:14,000
I’d still fly the rocket with my eyes closed.

657
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,000
Right with your eyes closed?

658
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:19,700
Don't believe me?

659
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,300
Here.

660
01:08:24,464 --> 01:08:27,200
Let's work. Work work work.

661
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,161
Attention. Attention attention attention.

662
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,705
All ready.

663
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,069
Here’s the button to contact the control center.

664
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,000
Here’s the link to the on-board power supply.

665
01:08:42,055 --> 01:08:44,112
- And here?
- The oxygen adapter.

666
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:45,900
And that?

667
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:47,500
The cooling system.

668
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,680
And there?

669
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,500
Solar batteries and the docking station.

670
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,200
- And what's that?
- Don’t touch that, Kolya,

671
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,463
that’s the emergency release system.

672
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,200
Right...

673
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,400
And this little green button that I’ve just pressed?

674
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:11,311
Why did you do that?

675
01:09:12,173 --> 01:09:15,173
You’ve started the first engine, you can’t stop it now.

676
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,400
What is this?

677
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,981
Vibrations, that's normal.

678
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,240
The ground power supply will shut down now.

679
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,200
Yes!

680
01:09:29,594 --> 01:09:30,700
What are you doing?

681
01:09:31,429 --> 01:09:35,000
Your fault. Don’t press buttons if you don’t know what they’re for.

682
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,615
Kolya, strap Nastya in your seat.

683
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,200
Follow my commands. Start.

684
01:09:42,457 --> 01:09:44,000
- Where?
- Your left.

685
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,500
Turn on the oxygen supply.

686
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:48,300
- Turn what?
- Press the seventh button.

687
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,800
The first mast came off.

688
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,000
Start the countdown.

689
01:09:57,492 --> 01:10:05,000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

690
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,542
Let's go.

691
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,200
Strap a whole antenna on top of it next time.

692
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:21,600
You, people of the dark. Have you ever heard of progress?

693
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,407
That’s a special float for night fishing.

694
01:11:24,893 --> 01:11:27,600
- The bulb lights up when there’s a catch.
- It’s daytime.

695
01:11:27,995 --> 01:11:33,100
- Who knows, maybe we’ll sit here till nighttime.
- Quiet, you’re going to scare all the fish away.

696
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:38,000
- I used to catch them in Japan with no floats at all.
- In a shop.

697
01:11:38,322 --> 01:11:40,322
You're a shop.

698
01:11:41,054 --> 01:11:43,200
That’s my place, I’ve fed them here.

699
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,648
A catch!

700
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,300
- Well, now untangle that.
- You’re no better. “A catch, a catch!”

701
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,000
- My bulb lit up.
- C’mon, untangle it.

702
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:00,016
- Give me your glasses.
- Carry your own.

703
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:02,324
Then let the magician untangle it, he’s used to it.

704
01:12:02,602 --> 01:12:05,300
Quiet please, you’ll wake little Pavel up.

705
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,300
Wow, it did grow back.

706
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:42,850
Good day.

707
01:15:47,593 --> 01:15:49,593
Seen each other already.

708
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,600
…and a cup of tea.

709
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:09,500
Three cups.
