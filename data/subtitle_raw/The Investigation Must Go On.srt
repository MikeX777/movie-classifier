Over my dead body!

6
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,636
He's got a gun!

7
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,195

Zohar! Zohar!

11
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,911
Hey! Wait up!

12
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,032
You know, sometimes people
make serious mistakes.

13
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,960
You're a social worker.
You ought to know.

14
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,153
What are you talking about?

15
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,429
Your husband's
been making lots of them.

16
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,593
Why don't you talk to him?
-I would if I could find him.

17
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,954
Can I come in?
Explain the situation?

18
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,234
Hello, Mrs. Shalom...

19
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,912
How are you?
-What do you care?

20
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,951
How's Shalom?

21
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,909
Rumor has it he took something
that doesn't belong to him.

22
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,998
Better warn him!

23
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,473
Shalom.

24
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,195
Shalom, police.

25
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,355
Let me see your badge.

26
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,950
Micha! Ronny!

27
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,476
Hi guys! You mean
you were chasing me?

28
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,753
Got a phone? I'll tell my wife
guests are coming.

29
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,958
We'll surprise her.
Got it?

30
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,833
Nothing surprises her anymore.
-I bet we will.

31
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,070
Zohar! Open up. We've got guests.

32
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,269
You're a wife-beater too, huh?
-I slipped on the sidewalk.

33
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,917
Slipped?

34
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,709
I'm gonna make
one hell of a comeback.

35
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,911
I'll give you a hell of a comeback
in federal prison.

36
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,558
Want something to drink?

37
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,909
Be my guests. Look around...
You won't find anything. I'm clean.

38
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,475
At school, we had a nurse
named Hajija.

39
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,400
I'd show her my hands
and say I'm clean.

40
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,593
She'd say If I look hard enough,
I'll find something.

41
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,391
And she always did. Get it?
-Yes, Hajija.

42
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,668
"ln the Country of Last Things"
You read these books?

43
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,589
Between police searches.
-For your job?

44
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,832
It's a secret.
-Top top secret!

45
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,997
What's this?

46
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,111
A piano.

47
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,711
And this?

48
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,920
It's fish food.
-It's mine. I put it there.

49
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,832
Zohar!

50
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,239
It's mine.
-Ronny, write this down

51
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,394
A narcotic substance was found.

52
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,674
The suspect claims it's fish food.
His wife claims it belongs to her.

53
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,790
We always find something.
Got it? Hajija.

54
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,275
Am I under arrest?
-What do you think?

55
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,318
I'm under arrest. -Then why ask?
-My natural curiousity.

56
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,152
I'm giving you a long rope.

57
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,436
I bet it doesn't even reach
the courtroom.

58
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,189
A really, long rope. Ok?
-Hang yourself with it. Ok?

59
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,512
I'll bury you. -On what grounds?
-We'll see.

60
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,875
We'll see. -We will see.
-We will see.

61
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,350
And see and see...
-And see and see and see...

62
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,637
You always have the last word?
-That's right. We'll see...

63
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,397
Eyes closed.

64
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,552
and,,...

65
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,356
"Oh, beloved fields,

66
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,269
"Oh white stones,

67
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,992
"It's good to roam the roads,

68
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,237
"Oh my love..." (Arabic)

69
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,469
He used to be a famous singer.
-Couldn't this wait half an hour?

70
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,595
I'm on to something. I'll solve
the armed robbery case in hours.

71
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,748
You interrupted us for that?
-Ohana's sure it's Robby and Momi.

72
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,553
Ohana's retiring next month.
So close the case and move on.

73
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,149
The investigation must go on.

74
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,835
Gentlemen, meet
Lieutenant Micha Stein.

75
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,549
The best dressed
detective on the force.

76
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,716
Where do you buy your clothes?

77
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,796
Macy's.
-At Macy's...

78
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,038
Do what you have to.
Just get results.

79
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,600
Come on! We still have
lots of work to do!

80
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,798
Let's go...,,,....

81
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,274
There he is!
That son-of-a-bitch!

82
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,236
There's the bastard
who shot my brother! I'll kill him!

83
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,671
Where is he?
Give the jewelry back!

84
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,558
I'll kill you!
Give the jewelry back!

85
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,430
I can't believe it!
You can't stay out of trouble.

86
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,995
Did you see that ape?
He tore my shirt.

87
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,394
He must have thought
I was hiding peanuts.

88
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,908
I can't take this anymore.

89
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,715
Zohar, I don't know what
they want from me! I swear!

90
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,438
What was that all about?

91
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,918
Gun shots?! Robbery?!
What's going on here?

92
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,072
It's all bullshit. I've never seen
that guy before in my life.

93
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,959
I'm as pure as a virgin.

94
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,792
I just can't take this anymore.

95
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,078
Don't say that, please.
Come on...

96
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,515
What should I tell the detective?

97
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,399
The whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

98
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,591
That someone just broke
my arm for no reason?

99
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,196
I don't know why
they did that to you.

100
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,760
Who was that guy who shot at you?

101
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,272
I have no idea! Maybe they're
trying to frame me.

102
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,556
I saw the policeman get shot
with my own eyes!

103
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,876
I didn't do anything!

104
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,953
Look at me!
I didn't do anything!

105
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,153
You can go home now.
The detective was injured.

106
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,231
Come back tomorrow.

107
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,751
Is it possible
she doesn't know anything?

108
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,196
I wire-tapped the house.

109
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,596
Who gave you orders to bug
the house? Ohana?

110
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,029
I bugged my own phone
to spy on my wife.

111
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,394
You've got to help me.
You're the only one I trust.

112
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,194
What are you talking about?
-She's seeing someone.

113
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,551
She goes out nights a week
to a dance class.

114
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,634
Follow her,
just for a couple of hours.

115
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,356
I'm going crazy. I have to know.

116
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,391
How was l?

117
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,834
How could you let them disappear?

118
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,880
Was I supposed
to baby-sit them all day?

119
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,520
At night I can't sleep with
the smell of the horses,

120
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,393
and during the day I have to babysit.

121
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,393
I can't take it anymore!
Smell me!

122
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,228
What am I a dog?
-I went to the store...

123
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,835
the cashier started
sniffing the air.

124
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,390
Good! Finally a chick
shows some interest in you.

125
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,914
Let's go.

126
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,272
Ohana, don't you know anyone
besides Robby and Momi?

127
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,238
Where did the asshole
and his wife disappear to?

128
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,396
What are you going to do to me?

129
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,670
I'm innocent. Torture me?

130
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,593
I'm not afraid of anything.
-Shut up, already!

131
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,239
Sit down.

132
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,756
Name? -Shalom.

133
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,678
Last name? -Shalom.

134
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,235
Shalom Shalom?
-My name is Shalom Shalom.

135
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,470
I'll take your statement now.
-About what?

136
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,431
Let's take your statement now,
Mr. Shalom Shalom.

137
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,036
I have nothing to say.
-Where were you last Thursday...

138
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,714
between a.m. and p.m.?

139
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,475
I don't know what I did last night.
You want me to remember last week?

140
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,352
Don't remember?
-Don't remember.

141
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,518
Don't remember, huh?
-Don't remember. -Try harder.

142
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,439
I'm trying so hard
my brain's about to explode.

143
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,788
You've been resurrected!
-Ronny, how about a cup of coffee.

144
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,399
Make mine with sugars,
stir it well.

145
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,510
Where were you last Thursday?

146
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,560
Doesn't remember,
heard nothing, saw nothing.

147
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,270
Thursday. That's all I want to know.
-He doesn't remember.

148
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,399
Thursday.
-Where was I and what did I do?

149
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,915
Yes, where were you
and what did you do?

150
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,429
I was at the beach all day.
-You're lying.

151
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,029
Know what? I wasn't.
-Then where were you?

152
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,794
First tell me
what I'm being accused of?

153
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,195
Thursday.
-What's the charge against me?

154
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,440
Don't play games with me.

155
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,234
I won't stop until you tell me.
Got it? -No.

156
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,189
Last Thursday. -Thursday or Friday,
I was at the beach.

157
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,275
It could've been Wednesday.

158
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,829
Write down Wednesday, Thursday
or Friday. I'm not sure.

159
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,673
Thanks. -Did you stir it well?
-Where's my coffee?

160
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,319
Last Thursday!

161
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,469
I don't know what you want!
I'm clean!

162
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,079
What soap do you use?
-Ajax.

163
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,755
Thursday! You little shit!

164
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,555
Whatever I have to say,
I'll say in court. I need to pee.

165
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,750
Thursday!

166
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,235
I was with a chick.
-Who? -I'm not telling.

167
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,551
With whom?
-Top top secret.

168
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,713
Hello?
-Coffee? Captain Ohana?

169
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,715
Someone said "screw" and hung up.

170
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,677
Well screw you too!
And your mother!

171
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,629
Oh, I'm sorry. Just a second.
Micha. It's your wife.

172
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,877
I don't know when I'll be home.

173
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,112
Shit! Four to three.

174
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,870
I have to pee.
-Who is this?

175
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,315
No one informed me.
-I cleared it with the chief.

176
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,149
I'm in charge here
and I have another lead.

177
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,591
I have to pee.
-Make in your pants. Got it?

178
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,116
I also need to lay some bricks.

179
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,916
Get him out of here!

180
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,957
Who's that? -The guy from the
Abramov robbery. -That guy?

181
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,749
Who's your informant?
I bet he's bullshitting you.

182
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,154
I got an anonymous call.
A woman's voice...

183
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,313
Don't worry.

184
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,677
Who said you could sit?
Go stand in the corner!

185
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,918
Face the wall!

186
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,872
I'm sick of you!

187
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,630
No problem, Ohana.
Keep chasing your tail.

188
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,432
What's the score?

189
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,714
Even. Four-Four.

190
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,636
I'm hungry.
I haven't eaten all day.

191
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,911
Sit over there.

192
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,111
Come closer. -How close?
-Close enough for me to slap you.

193
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,196
Ok, what's your name?

194
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,953
Mine -No. Your sister's.
-Barbara Walters.

195
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,159
You already asked me that.
-I'm asking again. -Shalom Shalom.

196
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,237
So what do you have to tell me?

197
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,197
Ok, you cracked me. I confess.

198
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,353
I smoke pot and once
I ran a red light.

199
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,836
You're not a kid.
Either play it straight or not.

200
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,675
What'll it be?
-I prefer the crooked way.

201
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,714
You're being a wise ass.
-No I'm not.

202
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,918
Do you know Robby and Momi?
-Just from the 'hood.

203
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,313
You haven't seen them
around lately? -No.

204
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,033
We've got a witness that saw you
robbing Abramov the jeweler.

205
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,437
I don't do that sort of thing.
-What sort of thing?

206
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,354
Armed robberies.
-There's no point in lying.

207
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,150
You're a lion. I'm a nightingale.
How can the bird beat the beast?

208
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,112
You're no nightingale.
You're a frozen chicken.

209
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,274
I'd like two eggs
sunny side up with toast.

210
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,753
We've nailed you.
We've got an air-tight case.

211
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,716
You just sit here

212
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,755
and think about everything
you've done. Got it?

213
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,598
You must be able to identify
at least one of them!

214
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,717
I told you. They wore helmets.

215
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,669
You said someone had been
following you

216
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,036
for a week before the robbery.

217
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,156
Is this the guy?

218
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,470
Maybe...

219
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,114
Maybe not. I don't know.

220
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,233
We'll wait till you're better
for a line-up.

221
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,595
Don't tell anybody I showed you
the picture. Ok?

222
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,596
Why did you bring us here?

223
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,389
I have to go to work.
-I have to pee.

224
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,154
Everyone who comes here
has to pee.

225
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,318
So, she can talk.
-I thought she was deaf and dumb.

226
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,793
What do they want with Shalom?
-Nothing. He's done nothing.

227
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,390
In the end they'll let him go
and beg for forgiveness. Creeps...

228
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,550
Careful, she might shoot you.

229
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,469
Here's my angel!
-Lady, leave him alone.

230
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,155
He's innocent!
-Mom, go home!

231
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,954
You're embarrassing me.

232
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,152
Come in, please.
Not you, Madam.

233
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,151
Why? Why not me?

234
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,111
I said no. -But why?

235
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,635
Come, sit down.

236
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,358
Allow me.

237
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,076
I wanted to have a chat with you.
-A chat or an interrogation?

238
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,233
Whichever turns you on.

239
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,918
Is this the guy that hurt you?
Solomon Cohen, a.k.a. Little Momi?

240
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,672
Is this the guy?

241
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,676
Don't know him. What do you want
with my husband?

242
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,073
Last Thursday. When did he go out?
-I don't know. I leave home early.

243
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,870
When you got back from work,
was he at home? -I don't remember.

244
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,075
I see you've got a hell
of a relationship.

245
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,752
It's a bit more complex
than a hell of a relationship.

246
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,672
Is he as free as a bird? -What does
that have to do with anything?

247
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,312
Do you think we just pester people
for no good reason?

248
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,510
From my experience, quite frequently.

249
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,354
Do I seem like that kind of guy?
-Yes.

250
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,912
You're a beautiful woman.

251
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,672
So now you think you'll soften
me up with compliments?

252
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,192
So a guy just walks up to you and
breaks your arm for no reason?

253
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,630
My husband owes money
to all kinds of people.

254
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,555
We're talking attempted murder.
A million dollars worth of jewelry.

255
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,630
What's so funny? A guy is dying
in the hospital. Is that funny?

256
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,999
That's just not his style.
-Then what is?

257
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,231
Surely not armed robbery.

258
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,036
Haven't you asked yourself why
you were assaulted?

259
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,838
You should start looking out
for yourself.

260
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,438
Anything's possible.
-What do you mean?

261
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,078
Do you want to get out of this mess?
-What do you think?

262
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,469
Getting out of this mess...

263
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,639
is a lot easier than you think.

264
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,595
Too bad you're a cop.

265
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,757
You're kind of cute.

266
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,834
I want to help you.

267
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,110
What are you trying to say?

268
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,714
What are you going to do?

269
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,878
Think about this chat.

270
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,877
Very good.

271
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,156
Very good.

272
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,037
We've lost them again.

273
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,673
Let's go.

274
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,597
Why'd they beat up your wife?
-Don't know.

275
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,314
Maybe they hate my music.
-Why are they after you.

276
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,751
Nobody's after me.
-They wanted money. Ok?

277
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,910
Why? What money?

278
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,231
Who were you with on Thursday?
-Who asked for your opinion?

279
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,992
You find this amusing, huh?
Where were you on Thursday?

280
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,315
How many times are you going
to ask the same question?

281
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,951
I got up, brushed my teeth,
parted my hair,

282
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,588
put on a shirt and went to pray.

283
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,233
One more time.

284
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,670
I got up early. About p.m...

285
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,639
Went to the mall,
had some coffee...

286
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,792
Helped Abe with his deliveries.

287
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,757
He has a big truck.
Abe the Midget...

288
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,435
How tall is he?
-About your height.

289
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,312
Stand up. Let's see.

290
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,194
What did you do next?
-We went to the movies.

291
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,875
Why do they call him The Midget
if he's my height?

292
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,160
Maybe your friends call you
"The Midget" behind your back.

293
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,992
Who'd you go to the movies with?
-A girlfriend.

294
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,876
Hey! We're trying to work
over here!

295
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,435
What movie? -We didn't go.
We went to her place instead.

296
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,878
Give me her name and address.
-Silvia Cohen. She lives on Sinai St.

297
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,992
Number or.

298
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,872
or?
- or?

299
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,712
or.

300
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:42,392
Is she better than your wife?
-Don't know if she's better or worse,

301
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,597
but she's very clingy.
She's crazy about me.

302
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,230
Doesn't care that I'm married...
or that I see other women...

303
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,718
What did you do at her place?
-You really want to know?

304
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,151
We went rounds.

305
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,470
Is a blow job
cosidered a round?

306
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,877
Yes it is.

307
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,556
Then rounds.
I didn't want to exaggerate.

308
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,109
As it's written in the Kabbala
"He who over indulges

309
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,670
in intercourse, ages quickly and
loses his power of body + mind."

310
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,030
My family's into photography

311
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,237
I caught the same bug.

312
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,949
I help my dad shoot weddings.
That's how I met Shalom.

313
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,632
Your voice sounds familiar.
Like I've heard it before...

314
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,037
Maybe in your dreams.

315
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,832
When did you last see him?
-Thursday.

316
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,157
Thursday? -Yes.

317
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,830
What makes you so sure?
-You don't forget a day like that.

318
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,831
What did you do all day?

319
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,394
What'd we do? We did it all day.

320
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,878
It was incredible.

321
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,515
Fire works...

322
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,796
What's he been charged with?

323
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,077
Do you see him often?
-As often as I can.

324
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,957
He spends the night here
and his wife doesn't mind?

325
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,671
She's used to it.

326
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,714
What did he do? Steal the
church's charity box?

327
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,430
Armed robbery and attempted murder.

328
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,914
Got it?

329
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,548
Shalom?

330
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,799
I didn't know I was hanging out
with such a big time gangster.

331
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,191
Do you know his wife?

332
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,591
I've seen her a couple of times.

333
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,156
Are they having problems?

334
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,554
If not, do you think he'd be
seeing me for years?

335
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,634
Those are all tapes
from weddings, bar-mitzvahs...

336
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,555
Have a look. Weddings...

337
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,592
That's a video I shot of Shalom
three years ago.

338
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,269
The guy's got the best
of both worlds.

339
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,910
Lives with his wife,
does you on the side.

340
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,914
Whichever way you look at it,
you're screwed.

341
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,150
I don't see it like that. -Then why'd
you call and leave a message...

342
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,595
that he robbed the jeweler?
-What?

343
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,990
I didn't leave any message.
-I'll take these tapes with me.

344
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,637
I won't let you.

345
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,637
"Search warrant"

346
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,717
Smart detective.

347
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,996
Do you have a box?

348
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,232
Anything else?

349
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,116
Say "Shalom Shalom
of number Queen St.

350
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,314
robbed Abramov the jeweler
and hid the loot in his house."

351
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,797
Do I have to?
-Only if you want to.

352
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,350
I don't feel like babbling nonsense.

353
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,708
I wish.

354
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,789
I wish someone would come
up here and join me.

355
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,110
I wish you a Happy New Year...

356
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,555
Wait... slow down there...

357
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,872
Are you trying to drive me crazy?
Do I need this?

358
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,720
Just a minute. I can't hear.
Rewind it...

359
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,990
So is that how she does it?
-What?

360
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,589
My wife. When she's
cheating on me...

361
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,475
You're driving yourself crazy.
-I'm telling you. She's got someone.

362
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,552
Silvia...

363
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,360
I'm going to score big!

364
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,831
I'll cover you with jewelry.
-We've got him!

365
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,751
Rewind it!

366
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,992
I'll devote whole hours
to you and your cheating wife!

367
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,272
When is her folk dancing class?

368
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,756
Ohana always goes
to his usual suspects.

369
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,350
Robby and Momi, the Holon twins,

370
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,516
then back to Robby and Momi.

371
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,668
Rewind it, will you!

372
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,069
Rewind it yourself,
I have to get home.

373
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,672
I didn't sleep all night.

374
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,992
I played cards with Peretz, Banai
and Darzi all night.

375
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,548
We finished a case of beer.
My head's killing me. -Who won?

376
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,792
Who do you think? -Peretz.

377
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,670
I cleaned them out.
At a.m. Peretz swore...

378
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,348
it was the last time
he'd play with me.

379
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,159
When you retire,
you can open a casino.

380
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,357
What a day I had yesterday.

381
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,319
The washing machine broke,
the plumber didn't show...

382
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,313
Then, my wife stuck
her ass in my face.

383
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,955
I thought you liked that.
-I like your wife's ass in my face.

384
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,436
So what happened yesterday?
Did your suspect confess?

385
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,275
I got a day extension
from the judge.

386
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,353
The way you were talking,
I thought you got at least.

387
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,992
Yeah? Next time he'll be indicted.

388
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,876
I've got a little surprise
for both of you. -What now?

389
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,999
Are you ready?

390
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,037
Ten,

391
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,956
nine,

392
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,876
eight,

393
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,871
seven,

394
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,391
six,

395
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,069
five, four,

396
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,874
I'll cover you with jewelry.

397
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,514
So what does the superstar
have to say?

398
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,348
Did it make you horny?

399
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,312
You can watch it together.
Give each other hand jobs.

400
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,830
How can you prefer
her over your wife.

401
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,273
Leave me alone, jackass.

402
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,676
So what's your explanation?
-I wasn't talking about a robbery.

403
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,152
I was talking about a hit song.
-A hit song?

404
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,193
Yes. A hit album.
-A hit album, huh?

405
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,276
Let see what the judge will say.
-You know what?

406
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,668
I bet he'll ask me for
her telephone number.

407
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,270
We shall see.
-We shall see and see.

408
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,151
"Let my people go!
Let my people go!"

409
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,719
Shut up!

410
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,949
Shut the fuck up!

411
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,436
I said shut the fuck up!

412
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,389
Micha! Let him go!

413
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,470
So what do you have to say now,
Capt. Ohana?

414
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,836
The tape proves nothing,
I have a feeling he's innocent,

415
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,956
Now I understand why
you never got any further.

416
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,913
years and you're still stuck here.

417
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,036
My gut tells me he didn't do it.

418
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,352
Your guts make me sick.

419
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,197
I didn't say you should release him.
-He has no alibi.

420
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,355
They broke his wife's arm.
You saw the tape.

421
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,795
How could he have nothing
to do with it?

422
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,071
I'll arrange
a line up with Abramov,

423
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,798
and end of story.

424
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,634
It'll be some time
before Abramov is well.

425
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,314
Why don't you go fishing
with the other old folks.

426
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,711
I'm still in charge here.

427
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,557
I'm going to interrogate him
properly. -What do you mean?

428
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,714
Wait and see.
-Why are you telling me?

429
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,315
You're in charge.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

430
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,558
Keep me out of this.

431
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,395
Great! Let me get my hands dirty,

432
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,229
so you can take the credit
once the case is solved!

433
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,519
Just tell me if these are the guys
who robbed you.

434
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,517
I already told
the other stupid cop

435
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,998
that they were wearing helmets.

436
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,352
But someone was following you
before the robbery. Take a look.

437
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,875
Maybe. Maybe not. I don't know.

438
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,710
Don't tell anybody that l
showed you these pictures.

439
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,075
Where's my coffee, Mary?
Is this anyway to treat a guest?

440
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,517
I told you not to call me Mary?

441
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,272
If I didn't know you since
grade school,

442
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,436
I'd think that you stole
the jewelry and the money.

443
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,474
You know me!
I don't do shit like that!

444
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,149
Yeah, right...

445
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,153
I'd never rip off a friend!
Not even a cigarette!

446
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,591
What about the gold watch
with diamonds

447
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,434
that you stuck in your sock
during the embassy robbery?

448
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,758
You still remember that?

449
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,915
Yeah.

450
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,515
We were kids then!
That doesn't count.

451
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,519
You said you'd never
rip me off.

452
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,597
We pulled this job together,
hid the loot...

453
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,673
I said, if I didn't
know you better

454
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,230
But you still suspect me.
-Of course I don't.

455
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,473
But maybe you told someone
something on the phone.

456
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,592
Who?

457
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,718
Who would I tell?

458
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,715
Don't know you can't trust
anyone anymore.

459
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,228
Am I getting any better?

460
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,879
I don't like that kind of music.

461
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,639
Whoever stole my loot,
is going to pay dearly.

462
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,518
The bastard will wish he
was never born.

463
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,474
Did you think about our
little chat? -I did.

464
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,071
I want to help you, Zohar.

465
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,551
It's dangerous for you here.
-He's done nothing.

466
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,833
He's tricking you.
I've got solid proof.

467
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,914
Proof? Then indict
him and let's go to trial.

468
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,875
Who's Silvia?
-I don't know.

469
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,469
You don't know?
-ls this a pop quiz?

470
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,959
Your husband claims he spent
Thursday night with her.

471
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,750
Maybe a witch who's got him
under her spell.

472
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,672
He promised to take her
to London.

473
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,154
Divide and conquer.

474
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,757
Zohar, believe me, I want
to help you. -I'll be fine.

475
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,957
This is your chance to
get out of here. -Yeah, sure.

476
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,036
Zohar, I'm willing to do
a lot for you.

477
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,276
And what do I have to do
for you?

478
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,311
Decide what you want to do
with your life.

479
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,637
This isn't right.

480
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,670
Think about what I said.

481
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,278
Micha...

482
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,031
I can help...
If you promise to release him.

483
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,194
I promise. After he testifies.

484
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,750
Someone asked him to hide a gun.

485
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,589
Where's the gun?

486
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,949
Will you release him?
-Yes.

487
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,436
If he testifies, I'll release him.

488
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,199
Get it?

489
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,039
Shalom!

490
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,591
The dog from the police squad
is with your wife. -Whaaaaa?

491
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,395
The dog from the police squad is with
your wife, you bastard!

492
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,317
Now give back the package!

493
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,949
What package? What the hell
are you babbling about?

494
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,551
How was that?

495
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,158
You asshole, you son of a bitch...

496
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,636
Give back the package or die.

497
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,388
I'm warning you...

498
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,229
You asshole, you son of a bitch...

499
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,117
Give back the package or die.
I'm warning you! -Go on.

500
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,157
Shalom!

501
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,800
Give back the package or die!

502
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,352
I'm warning you!
-Mary, you pussy!

503
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,194
Tell Robby I don't have anything!

504
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,153
What's that smell?

505
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,835
We've been at the ranch all week.

506
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,275
Horse shit everywhere you look.

507
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,555
Crime is taking over the country.

508
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,354
You can't move
without getting mugged.

509
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,028
You can't trust anybody.
-Shhh...

510
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,913
The fellows make a plan,

511
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,918
Take some risks...

512
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,151
Serious risks!

513
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,756
Then along comes this guy
out of nowhere and takes the loot!

514
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,109
Can't you understand how we feel?
-You can't trust anybody.

515
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,594
I told you the cops started
sniffing around,

516
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,275
so I gave him the loot
and the gun to hide!

517
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,312
His wife must know where it is!
He tells her everything!

518
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,831
We'll go pay her a visit.

519
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,074
If we don't find anything there,
we'll be back.

520
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,395
I'm giving you my word.

521
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,951
I'm not recording any of this.

522
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,357
Just tell me what you know.
It'll stay between us.

523
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,151
As safe as...

524
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,751
what's that place
in America? Port?

525
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,629
Fort Knox.
-That's it. Fort Knox.

526
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,276
Are you friends
with Robby and Momi?

527
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,397
I've got nothing to do with them.

528
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,398
Momi got married and didn't
hire me to sing at his wedding.

529
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,191
He hired some Russian singer
who sings in ltalian.

530
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,471
So tell dumb, old Ohana...

531
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,708
How could you be dating

532
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,076
Silvia Cohen for years,

533
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,277
and not know Robby and Momi.
She hangs out with them.

534
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,599
I have nothing to do with them.
Silvia introduced us once.

535
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,396
You know what?
Strap me to a lie detector.

536
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,754
You'll blow up the machine.

537
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,516
You were here last year. It took
them three months to repair it.

538
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,998
Rake me over hot coals.

539
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,635
What was the "hit" you
told Silvia about?

540
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,030
I thought I'd record a hit album.

541
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,397
But it didn't work out.

542
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:00,636
Your wife was beaten up! Why?!

543
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,234
I'm trying to figure that out myself.

544
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,914
If it was about the money I owe,
it wouldn't come to that.

545
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,478
Bon appetit!

546
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,072
What's that under your arm?
-What's under my arm?

547
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,678
The other one.
-Oh, that.

548
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,956
This is the gun from the robbery.

549
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,555
So, what does our Song Bird
have to say about this?

550
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,558
Leave him alone. Can't you see
that I'm interrogating him.

551
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,438
Is this how you interrogate him?

552
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,438
Just a moment please.

553
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,477
It's the chief.

554
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,758
He says that he can hear you chewing
all the way upstairs.

555
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,390
Very funny. You should do stand-up
at the squad's party.

556
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,029
The chief wants to see you.

557
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,709
I'll come with you.
I want to speak to him too.

558
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,474
We don't have time for
nobodies like you.

559
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,359
Be thankful that we're even
talking to you. Got it?

560
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,354
I'm very grateful to the police for
hosting a music star.

561
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,671
Be nice to the Captain.

562
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,992
Tell him the whole truth.
Get it?

563
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,675
Got it.
-What did you get?

564
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,315
I should tell him the whole truth,

565
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,756
which is that I'm innocent.

566
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,270
Groovy. Have fun.

567
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,831
What about the gun he found?

568
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,748
Did you get it from Robby and Momi?

569
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,789
I've never seen that gun.

570
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,753
Testify against them
and I'll send you home.

571
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,078
Why won't you understand?

572
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,915
Silvia will tell you.
I was with her all day.

573
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,235
What's up with the investigation?
You said hours.

574
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,636
Like you said "The investigation
must go on."

575
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,676
I'll close the case in the next days.
-How long can we hold him?

576
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,513
Seven days.

577
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,112
Let him finish his time
and go home. You go too.

578
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,318
Overdoing it can be
very harmful.

579
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,919
Home?

580
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,556
This case is closed.

581
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,668
I've got the video, the gun...

582
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,276
He'll come to his senses
and confess,

583
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,159
and even if he doesn't,
Abramov will identify him.

584
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,990
Are there any fingerprints?
-None.

585
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,109
I checked it out. That's not
the gun that shot Abramov.

586
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,914
So it's the other guy's gun.

587
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,558
Micha, you look drained.
Why don't you go home.

588
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,589
Your wife called and asked me
to give you some time off.

589
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,799
Go home.

590
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,351
OK, I'll finish up and go.

591
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,917
You can't win 'em all.
Ohana will close the case.

592
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,070
Where's Ohana?
-He went home.

593
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,315
What's this?
-A vacuum cleaner.

594
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,393
A vacuum cleaner?
-lt must be a new model.

595
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,435
I'll blow your brains out with it!
You've never seen it before?

596
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,671
Stein, it's your wife.

597
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,200
Are you crazy?
Why'd you call the chief?

598
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,039
Have you lost your mind!

599
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,472
You're right, I'm sorry.
I completely forgot.

600
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,192
Yes. Tonight, if it all works out.

601
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,597
I promise. When did I ever
break a promise?

602
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,590
Everything's Ok. It works.

603
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,591
Don't play games!

604
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,190
Are you signing a confession?
-I'm not signing my confession!

605
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,200
Micha? What's that noise?

606
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,711
I want you to surprise her.

607
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,713
She has that folk
dancing class tonight.

608
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,754
Don't worry, Danny.
Everything will be Ok.

609
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,119
You'll sign a confession even if
it's the last thing I do. Got it?

610
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,029
We shall see.

611
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,912
We shall see.

612
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,913
We shall see...
-And see and see and see...

613
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,355
I'll show you
who gets the last word!

614
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,234
Now we'll see
who gets the last laugh!

615
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,758
Up here!

616
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,590
I'll leave you here...

617
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,111
and no one will ever know.
Get it?

618
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,474
I'm sick of nobodies like you.

619
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,912
Shalom!

620
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,069
Shalom, can you hear me?

621
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,399
I'm staying down here.
-Grab the rope. I'll pull you up.

622
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,150
Say you're sorry.

623
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,470
I've got plenty of time.

624
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,596
Grab the rope!

625
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,914
I'll wait for them
to come after you.

626
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,871
I'm leaving.

627
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,916
Say "I'm sorry bro".

628
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,037
What else do you want?
-I want my lawyer.

629
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,874
How about a masseuse?
-A masseuse too.

630
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,752
Bro, say you're sorry.

631
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,874
Ok. I'm sorry.
Don't make it an issue.

632
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:06,632
No, no. Say "I'm sorry, bro".

633
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,199
I'm sorry, bro.

634
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,158
Pull bro, pull.

635
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,995
You know what bro,

636
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,274
I forgive you.

637
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,033
I've got a feeling
we're making a mistake.

638
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,954
Feelings can't be trusted.
Get it?

639
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,115
I don't like this!
You're going to kill him!

640
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,237
Would you like a transfer?!

641
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,431
I'll do the paperwork tomorrow.

642
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,630
Were you in on the robbery?

643
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,675
I have to know.
-What the fuck do you care?

644
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,876
Tomorrow you'll be
on a new case.

645
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,230
In another month you
you won't even remember me.

646
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,711
You'll be an asshole
like all the others.

647
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,833
Get out of my face!

648
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,953
Go! Bitch! Go!

649
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,277
Hi there. I want my package back.

650
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,358
Who's this? -Tell your husband
to give back the package.

651
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,233
Call the post office.

652
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,074
You and your husband are
making a big mistake. Big...

653
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,511
The whore hung up on me.

654
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,871
Is that it?
-Thanks.

655
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,955
They shot up the house.
I've got to talk to Shalom.

656
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,312
You can't. He's being interrogated.
-I have to.

657
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,234
You have to get out of here
till this is all over.

658
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,074
Not until I speak to him.

659
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,429
Ok, but I have to record
the conversation.

660
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,312
The Midget showed me the gun
I supposedly used in the robbery.

661
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,755
He wanted me to confess...

662
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,559
I don't know where they got
the gun from.

663
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,913
I also don't know.
-You don't know?

664
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,674
I've been shot! Haven't we
played enough games?

665
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,072
It's a mistake. They were
probably after Fat Sammy.

666
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,352
They sprayed the whole house!

667
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,599
Shit! I just painted the
living room. -Enough already!

668
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,631
When this is all over, we'll buy
a house in the mountains.

669
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:23,275
We'll have fruit trees.
Apples, plums, coconuts...

670
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,158
A little recording studio...

671
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,193
Coconuts won't grow in the
mountains. They need warm weather.

672
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,756
What? I've been dreaming about
coconut trees for ages.

673
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,359
You can grow apples, pears,
avocado, but not coconuts.

674
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,796
I hate avocado.

675
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,352
When you get out, I think
we should take some time off.

676
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,839
You're my life, my soul...

677
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,113
You're the only person
I have left.

678
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,395
What about your mother?

679
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,595
A mother's a mother.

680
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,879
I don't know... This time
I think you went too far.

681
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,958
You don't believe me either?
-What about Silvia?

682
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,870
You believe all their bullshit?

683
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,394
I don't know who
to believe anymore.

684
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,637
Great... My wife doesn't even
believe me.

685
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,310
The world has ended. The fish
are climbing trees.

686
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,269
I think she got you
into this mess.

687
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,796
Why would she do a
thing like that?

688
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,833
It's over between us.
I told you. It's over.

689
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,836
I know you were with her
on Thursday.

690
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,240
What was the Midget doing
with you the other night?

691
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,111
A house call?

692
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,315
Why'd you give him the gun?

693
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,030
How could you do this to me?

694
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,954
You know I'm crazy about you.

695
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,594
I'm mad about you.

696
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,675
I forgive you for everything.

697
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,872
I was trying to help you.
You're hurting me.

698
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,829
Don't hurt me.

699
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,714
You're my life, my soul...

700
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,280
Sure I am...

701
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,390
Zohar, open up. I just want to
make sure that you're Ok.

702
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,670
I know you're in there.

703
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,310
Open up. I want to see you.

704
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,038
You promised you'd let him go!
I gave you the gun!

705
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,390
You promised!
-How could l?

706
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,471
He said he had nothing to do
with the gun!

707
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:25,511
You promised!
-Open the door! I want to talk!

708
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,598
We have nothing to talk about!
-Open the door, Zohar!

709
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,396
I want to talk to you!

710
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,190
What's going on here?

711
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,349
Go back inside! Get inside
before I arrest you all.

712
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,917
I'll call the cops.
I have connections! -lnside!

713
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,317
Burn in hell. You pig!

714
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,828
Open the door.
I want to talk to you.

715
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,151
Have you calmed down?

716
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,269
I brought you a gift.

717
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,274
Paul Auster.
"The Music of Chance".

718
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:18,869
I read it already. Go away,
I'm begging you.

719
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,879
Have you calmed down? -I thought
there is something between us.

720
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,598
Last night I dreamt I was
the manager of a club.

721
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,711
A strip joint...

722
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:48,473
The strippers were dancing,
slowly taking off their clothes...

723
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,553
Bras and panties...

724
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,030
The most beautiful one...

725
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,797
was dancing just for me.

726
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,438
She was naked, but I could feel
her hiding something from me.

727
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,197
Micha, please go away.

728
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,076
You tricked me.
You let me feel...

729
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,993
You were lying to me all along.

730
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:27,238
You know where the money
and jewelry are!

731
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,989
You know and won't tell me!

732
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,631
The last time I performed
was last month,

733
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:46,636
at a huge party at a hotel
for a guy...

734
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,388
who just got out of jail.

735
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,795
It was such a blast. They wouldn't
let me leave the stage.

736
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,312
After the show,
me, Silvia and chicks

737
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,188
got a room at the hotel.

738
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,516
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

739
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,797
Your wife is waiting at home
while you're partying?

740
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,397
It got so hot in there...

741
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,715
the room was on fire.

742
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:20,833
That seems so far away now.
Like it was years ago...

743
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:33,079
What's up? Card games
cleaned you out?

744
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,268
The jeweler died.
Now, we're talking homicide.

745
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,790
I brought Silvia in for questioning.

746
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,831
Silvia?

747
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,791
As of this moment you're being
charged with armed robbery & murder.

748
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,680
You and your parties
make me puke.

749
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,950
Who shot the jeweler?
You or your partner?

750
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:06,077
I never robbed anyone in my life!
Get off my back! Enough!

751
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:09,432
Adi, leave the room.
-Don't go. Don't go.

752
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,038
Leave the room.

753
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,076
You're the worst kind of scum!

754
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,311
Why'd you get married!

755
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,109
So she could sit at home
and swallow your shit?!

756
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,835
Why'd you get married!

757
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,151
What were your plans for
the money?

758
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,233
To leave for London
with that whore?!

759
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,674
You've the hots for her, huh?

760
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,037
But it won't get you anywhere.

761
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:13,392
I love her and she loves me.
And I'm innocent! Innocent!

762
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,676
Four years ago,
a guy named Henigstein,

763
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,030
got blown up
with a hand grenade.

764
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:28,148
He lost an arm and a leg
and couldn't understand,

765
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,510
why this happened to him.

766
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,678
I decided to look into it.
And guess what I found out?

767
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,717
The guy had a girlfriend he
broke up with a month earlier.

768
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,956
So I'm here because of a boyfriend
who got blown up...

769
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,474
four years ago?
-Time passed.

770
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,477
She found a new boyfriend

771
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,875
Robby and Momi are in the picture.

772
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,954
Seems to me there's a
link between the stories.

773
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,071
My intuition tells me,

774
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,315
that you heard about
Robby and Momi's plan,

775
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,837
and wanted a piece of the pie,
so you told Shalom about it.

776
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,319
You planned to go
to London together.

777
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,313
But he decided to leave you
and go back to his wife.

778
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,156
That's a big fat lie!

779
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,948
You wanted revenge,
so you informed the police.

780
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,316
No, I love him.

781
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,154
You can help him.
Where's the jewelry?

782
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,110
I swear I don't know.

783
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,958
All I know is

784
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,237
that Shalom isn't capable
of pulling that off.

785
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,470
How did he get the gun?

786
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,756
A gun?

787
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,510
What gun are you talking about?
-lsn't it a shame?

788
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,398
They are beating the shit
out of him day and night.

789
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,997
An innocent man...

790
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,476
You know what, Ohana?

791
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,031
You've touched my heart.
I robbed the jeweler.

792
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:10,230
Tomorrow, I'm going
to shave my head.

793
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,552
Enough of this life
of sin and promiscuity.

794
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,198
I'm born again!

795
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:23,511
God has turned his back on you!

796
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,158
There's no one left
to save you! Get it?!

797
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,391
Sylvia, tell him we were together
on Thursday!

798
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,399
Leave him alone!
He was with me all day!

799
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:45,111
Leave him alone! He was with me!

800
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,678
I'm crazy about you!

801
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,958
Tell him.

802
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,398
Micha, should I bring him in?
-I need to take a shit.

803
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,154
Get him out of here.

804
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,351
I will get out of here.

805
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,753
Shalom, stop!

806
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,629
Stop! Micha, Ronny,
he's getting away!

807
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:47,433
Where's the chief?
-At the rehersal.

808
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,634
What's up guys? Have a good show.

809
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,470
Why are you running away,
is it that bad here?

810
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,597
Excuse me, we're in a hurry.

811
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,392
Miriam?

812
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,151
Mom?

813
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,549
Fucking yuppie!
I want my package back!

814
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,995
I don't know
what you're talking about!

815
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,149
He didn't tell you?

816
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,790
He didn't tell me anything!
-He didn't tell you?

817
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,998
He didn't tell me!
I don't know anything! -Bitch!

818
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,952
She turns me on.

819
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,549
Move! I'm going to do her.
-Stop! Stop!

820
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:31,829
Momi, leave her alone.

821
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,509
"A Ma'alot poem

822
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:55,231
"l will lift up my eyes
to the hills,

823
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:01,559
"From whence comes my help?

824
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:10,154
"My help comes from the Lord,

825
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:18,637
"who made heaven and earth.

826
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,719
"He will not suffer

"He who keeps thee

01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:42,435
"Behold, he who keeps Yisra'el
shall neither slumber nor sleep.

829
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,798
"The Lord is thy keeper.

830
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,753
"the Lord is thy shade
upon thy right hand.

831
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,354
I couldn't sleep.
I was up all night thinking

832
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,478
about Zohar and me,
and how all this will end.

833
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:17,669
My life flashed before my eyes.
Such horrible thoughts...

834
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,872
walked around, got back
in bed... My whole body aches.

835
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:26,074
You can talk freely.
It'll stay between us.

836
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,398
Not here.

837
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,069
You choose the place.
Wherever you want.

838
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,113
Your underwear too.
-I'm not hiding anything.

839
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,154
I believe you,
but you make me horny.

840
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:23,679
I can help you.

841
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,360
Is that the best you can do?
You're like a father to me.

842
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,909
Doesn't a father get
to hear the truth?

843
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:36,837
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

844
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,630
We were informed you
pulled off a robbery.

845
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,679
We have you on tape saying
you're going to score big.

846
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,115
We find a gun you hid
near your house.

847
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,436
What are we
supposed to think?

848
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,356
What was Micha supposed to think?
-That you've framed an innocent man.

849
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,152
Who'd do a thing like that?

850
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,554
I was with her for years.
Last month I decided to end it.

851
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:07,197
That's not enough. I need more.

852
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,119
The jewelry, the money...
What about the gun?

853
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:16,153
She gave me the gun. She asked
me to hide it. I'll testify.

854
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,792
I'll arrest Sylvia, Robby and
Momi right away. It'll be Ok.

855
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,995
Nothing will ever be Ok again.

856
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:06,837
Faggots! The gynecologist is
here to check your assholes!

857
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,714
Shut up!

858
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,156
The cop's on the grass,

859
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,795
opening up his ass...

860
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:30,799
Lock him back up and go home.
We'll close the case tomorrow.

861
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:35,549
Want to let our main suspect walk?
-After he testifies.

862
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,873
Take a couple of days off.
Take the family someplace.

863
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,671
Listen to Ohana.

864
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,230
Yeah...

865
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:52,118
I could use a vacation.

866
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,674
I've accumulated
lots of vacation days.

867
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,637
I've been very tense lately.

868
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:11,399
I've got stuff to finish up,
and then I'll take a vacation.

869
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:18,950
We'll wrap up the paperwork
and go home.

870
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,912
Thanks.

871
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,478
Ohana!

872
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,272
Get the car!

873
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,873
We're moving to a place
where we won't be bothered.

874
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:49,439
Stop it.

875
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,673
Micha, why don't you
give it up?

876
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,908
He's nice and ripe.
Ready to confess...

877
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,719
I don't have time.
-He'll confess. Come.

878
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,677
I have to be home by nine.

879
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:04,070
I promised my wife I'd go with her
to her folk dance class.

880
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,509
I've been practicing all week.

881
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:17,516
It's real easy!
Why don't you join us?

882
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,711
You'll be home by nine.
Let's go!

883
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:52,835
Sometimes I get these
philosophical notions.

884
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,235
For instance,

885
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,956
that the life path

886
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,635
of Micha Stein

887
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:05,791
just out of millions
and billions,

888
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:10,233
collides with the life
paths of others.

889
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,318
Get it?

890
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:17,399
And whosever path collides
with mine,

891
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:20,518
veers off in a
whole new direction.

892
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,914
I love the silence
of the night.

893
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,911
You know what I mean?

894
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,719
Silence or not,
I'm staying in the car.

895
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,596
Get him out of the car.

896
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,996
Do you recognize this place?
-I live here. -Yeah?

897
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,876
Listen to the sounds.

898
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,950
Nothing but you, me and God.

899
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,196
You know what, Shalom?

900
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,875
Sometimes I feel
like his messenger.

901
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:30,278
What do you want from me?
-No less then a full confession,

902
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,194
the location of the money,
the jewelry and the gun.

903
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,315
My deal with Ohana is that
I testify and go home.

904
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,552
We're on our way home.

905
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:44,508
I read your testimony.
Very beautiful indeed.

906
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,036
Just lacking the important details.

907
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,879
Did you think Lt. Micha Stein
would let you win?

908
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,836
I'll shoot you,
saying you tried to escape.

909
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,990
You wouldn't dare.
There's a limit!

910
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,435
You've lost your mind!

911
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,072
I set the limits.

912
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,954
Adi, stop him! He's insane!

913
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,718
I decided to waste you.

914
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:18,914
I'll confess to it all!
Just leave me alone!

915
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:22,436
Where's the weapon,
the jewelry, all of it?

916
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,159
Go ahead, Danny!
Roll the tape!

917
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,438
Ronny bring the shovel.

918
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,560
There's nothing and there
never was anything.

919
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,430
Put down the gun!

920
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,828
Shit, what a world...

921
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:46,352
"How long will evil rejoice"?

922
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,590
Ronny, Adi shoot him!

923
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,679
I have nothing left!
I'll take you all with me!

924
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,270
Drop it before you do
something you'll regret!

925
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,916
You were doing fine until your
life path collided with mine!

926
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,515
You shouldn't have
collided with me!

927
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:24,759
Did you see that,
he tried to kill me!

928
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,752
He's dead.

929
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:27,591
