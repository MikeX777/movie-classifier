00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:33,069
MAN WATOHING VIDEO aka REWIND

6
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:47,047
That actress's deer like eyes

7
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:50,350
resemble a woman
I knew in my twenties.

8
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,853
If I didn't call her for five days

9
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:55,083
she'd think I'd dumped

10
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,105
Mister...

11
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:56,975
Where are the others?

12
00:03:57,317 --> 00:04:00,753
I'm sorry... they're still...

13
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:04,550
Only one, and it looks like this.

14
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:07,027
If you don't have the others

15
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:08,824
you'll have to pay.

16
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:12,462
How much are they?

17
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:15,462
Three tapes, so 60,000...

18
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:17,833
Just give me 60,000 won.

19
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:23,609
60,000 won? That's too much.

20
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:26,243
They're worth 70,000 won.

21
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,744
Hey, mister...

22
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:35,513
- Do you like to drink?
- What?

23
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:38,755
Do you like drinking alcohol?

24
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,629
I'll be back in a week.

25
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,824
Please have it ready by then.

26
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:48,924
588...

27
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:54,394
I'm writing this letter

28
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:56,555
after much hesitation.

29
00:06:57,564 --> 00:06:59,999
I've been watching you for a long time.

30
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:02,535
Please don't think that I'm crazy.

31
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:05,299
Please don't think that I'm crazy.

32
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:08,341
I feel something for you.

33
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:11,003
I don't know. Perhaps it is.

34
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:13,580
A tremor in my heart...

35
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,016
Or the warmth of a spring afternoon.

36
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:21,788
It's not love I feel.

37
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:23,957
I don't know.

38
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:26,559
Perhaps it is.

39
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:30,655
It's just that you come to...

40
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:33,466
So cold. You're open late today.

41
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:34,865
I was here earlier.

42
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:37,667
- Did you work the night shift?
- Yes.

43
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:40,607
- Video store.
- It's me, Ho-June.

44
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:41,908
Kwang's leaving soon for Australia.

45
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:45,639
We're meeting tonight.

46
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:48,171
Okay, I'll come.

47
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:49,807
Hey, mister!

48
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:54,113
Do you have the new Steven Seagal movie?

49
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:56,456
He doesn't have many movies out.

50
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:59,025
Have you seen 'Marked for death'?

51
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:01,016
I saw that a long time ago.

52
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:04,060
Seagal's the best in action films.

53
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:18,211
Why not just crawl into the calendar?

54
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:19,872
What?

55
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:25,214
- Oheers!
- Oheers! Drink up!

56
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:31,825
I don't get you.

57
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:34,394
You leave law school, get a good job,

58
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:36,885
and then quit.

59
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:39,666
Now you're running a video shop?

60
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,226
What's wrong with a video shop?

61
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:44,662
Here, have a drink.

62
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:47,907
Do you hear from your ex-wife?

63
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:49,670
That's all over now.

64
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:57,314
How do you feel about leaving?

65
00:08:57,617 --> 00:09:00,381
Like I'm just moving far, far away.

66
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:04,390
Hey, you paid all your debts and now you're set.

67
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,359
You could just stay here.

68
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:10,591
Yeah, but I feel like my luck is done here.

69
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,358
Pick up the mood a bit!

70
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:15,993
He's not going to die!

71
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:18,771
To our beloved friend, Kwang!

72
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:22,036
Okay, okay. Oheers!

73
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:38,350
Evening sir.

74
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:45,131
People buy dolls at this hour?

75
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:47,895
Of course!

76
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:53,740
Give it to your wife

77
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,708
she'll love it.

78
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,280
But mister I don't have a wife.

79
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,875
Then how about... hug one to sleep instead.

80
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:09,578
Alright, pick one for me.

81
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,126
This here's a female.

82
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,130
They say it won't snow on Ohristmas this year.

83
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,133
But still hoping for a snowy Ohristmas,

84
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:02,966
our next song is White Ohristmas.

85
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,065
One childhood memory clearly springs to mind.

86
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:34,834
One childhood memory clearly springs to mind.

87
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,936
One day, after raining all night,

88
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:39,972
everything looked clear like glass.

89
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:43,810
It felt like a fairy tale like

90
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:48,081
I was in a country village.

91
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:51,384
Then the thought of going to school seemed unbearable.

92
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:53,152
Then the thought of going to school seemed unbearable.

93
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:55,088
If I go past a corner into an alley,

94
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:58,319
Give me 300 won
to buy a drink please.

95
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:01,693
Give me 300 won
to buy a drink please.

96
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:09,463
Give me 300 won
to buy a drink please.

97
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:23,773
- Hello.
- Oh, Hello.

98
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,819
I need to rent this for another week.

99
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:28,955
- Again?
- Yes.

100
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:32,789
If I play this my girl stays well on her own.

101
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,727
Without it, I don't think

102
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:37,025
I could work at the factory.

103
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,066
I'll make you a copy, then.
No use paying for it every time.

104
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:42,101
Would you do that?

105
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:45,371
- Stop by after work.
- How can I thank you?

106
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:48,738
No need. You borrowed it so often
that I made enough on it.

107
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:50,643
Oh, but actually

108
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:54,977
I need to drop it at home before going to the factory.

109
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:58,951
Then I'll drop it at your place on my rounds later.

110
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,215
Then I'll drop it at your place on my rounds later.

111
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:03,456
Thank you so much.

112
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,549
I owe you a big favor.

113
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:50,025
Mommy!

114
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:39,485
Mister, where's 'My wife is a gangster'?

115
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:40,679
Just a minute, please.

116
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:49,094
Right, here it is.

117
00:15:56,302 --> 00:15:57,701
Thank you, bye.

118
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,015
Mister! Help me, please?

119
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:10,346
What's wrong?

120
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:12,418
A man's been following me for a few days.

121
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:15,080
I was scared, so I came here.

122
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:23,122
- What does he look like?
- It was too dark.

123
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,264
No one's there.

124
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:39,868
Are you okay?

125
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:43,745
Yes. Thank you.

126
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,777
If it weren't for you I'd be in trouble.

127
00:16:51,023 --> 00:16:52,992
Are you going home?

128
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:55,187
Yes, I'm on my way.

129
00:16:58,164 --> 00:17:06,663
What am I gonna do? What direction are you going?

130
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:13,612
The phone's ringing.

131
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:16,342
Just customers looking for videos.

132
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:29,695
The one with the light on. That's my place.

133
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:31,390
Thank you very much.

134
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:32,965
If you're out late,

135
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:35,126
you should have someone walk you home.

136
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:37,403
I live alone

137
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:40,895
so there's no one to do that for me.

138
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,066
We're here. Go on up.

139
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:47,808
Thank you so much.

140
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:54,687
Mister? Would you like

141
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,383
to come up for some tea?

142
00:17:57,523 --> 00:18:00,326
No, that's fine. Go on up.

143
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:01,452
Goodbye.

144
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:07,593
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

145
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:15,341
This new year I'll work hard

146
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:17,710
so that in 3 years

147
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,745
I can buy a small but pretty house.

148
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:21,736
I mean, apartment.

149
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:23,783
Thank you.

150
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:26,018
I hope your dream comes true.

151
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:27,178
Thank you.

152
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,555
People anticipate a new year full of hope.

153
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:32,625
And it's just around the corner.

154
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,361
All the hardships

155
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:36,794
of the past year will be buried...

156
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:12,196
- Video shop.
- It's me.

157
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:17,436
You're looking good.
Something new in your life?

158
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:20,371
Nothing really...
You look good, too.

159
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:24,871
I put some make-up on to see you
since it's been a while.

160
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:28,080
How's the shop?

161
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,312
It's fine. Perfect for someone
who can't do anything.

162
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:35,119
You aren't seeing anyone new?

163
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,682
The owner here
must still remember us.

164
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:47,395
I have something to ask you.

165
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:52,495
What would you think
if I get re-married?

166
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:57,870
Is what I think important? It's your life.

167
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:01,046
Sure. It's my decision, honey, but...

168
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:05,312
You were always so good
at counseling me.

169
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:10,256
Is that why you wanted
to meet me today?

170
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:12,019
Yeah.

171
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:15,150
Want a smoke?

172
00:20:15,427 --> 00:20:17,793
No, I quit.

173
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,966
He doesn't like you smoking?

174
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:23,696
It's just for health reasons.

175
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:29,775
You're pretty fast.
A fiance in 7 months.

176
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:32,437
Are you making fun of me?

177
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:37,078
I think...

178
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:42,254
I don't know.

179
00:20:42,254 --> 00:20:44,757
Living alone,

180
00:20:44,757 --> 00:20:48,193
I realized we're not well
suited for marriage.

181
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:50,829
Actually, I'm Ionely at times.

182
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:53,999
But that doesn't mean
I'll get married.

183
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:58,170
What I mean is... I'm just not sure
you'll be happier

184
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,139
if you get re-married.

185
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:02,505
Not sure you'll be happier

186
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:17,147
We made the right decision.

187
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:30,958
Sorry, don't worry about me.

188
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:39,874
I meant to give you this before.

189
00:21:48,354 --> 00:21:50,151
And also...

190
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:08,562
Well, this is yours.

191
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:27,115
Take care.

192
00:24:57,109 --> 00:24:59,304
Do you regret taking this train?

193
00:24:59,912 --> 00:25:02,380
No, why?

194
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,914
Do you regret taking this train?

195
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:09,679
No, why?

196
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:16,193
For every road
the beginning's most important.

197
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:19,594
You said your husband
might come today.

198
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:23,724
It's okay.

199
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:27,339
I have a good man
beside me now.

200
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:30,206
Who cares
if he beats me to death?

201
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:47,426
When's the last time I had sex?

202
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:49,189
When's the last time I had sex?

203
00:25:50,195 --> 00:25:52,264
Perhaps the things
that are recorded today,

204
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:54,066
will in time teach me things

205
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:56,057
I don't know now.

206
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:07,408
There was a solar eclipse yesterday. It was strange.

207
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:10,382
I talked long on the phone with Hyun

208
00:26:10,382 --> 00:26:13,010
who's still single.

209
00:26:20,692 --> 00:26:23,128
After being married for a year
couples in love...

210
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:26,331
After being married for a year
couples in love...

211
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:32,070
eventually begin to realize
something about each other.

212
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:37,643
That is... the belief they were

213
00:26:37,643 --> 00:26:40,078
perfect for each other fades away

214
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:42,478
and they are disappointed.

215
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:56,929
What sort of impression
did my second letter leave on you?

216
00:26:56,929 --> 00:26:58,897
What sort of impression
did my second letter leave on you?

217
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:02,828
I keep wondering about that.

218
00:27:03,435 --> 00:27:05,137
But, actually,

219
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:07,935
your response does not really matter.

220
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,377
Most important is...

221
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:15,213
the longing that stems from my heart.

222
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:18,016
Everything is so confusing.

223
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:21,653
I'm not sure

224
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:24,986
that I'll write to you again.

225
00:27:25,691 --> 00:27:27,259
This all could result in nothing so my heart shivers,
always questioning.

226
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:31,797
This all could result in nothing so my heart shivers,
always questioning.

227
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:34,466
This all could result in nothing so my heart shivers,
always questioning.

228
00:27:34,466 --> 00:27:37,636
I will stop here.

229
00:27:37,636 --> 00:27:39,729
I hope it can end this way.

230
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:46,240
Give me 300 won
to buy a drink please.

231
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:55,712
Give me 300 won
to buy a drink please.

232
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:17,142
You can't buy a drink
with 300 won.

233
00:28:17,142 --> 00:28:18,443
Hey, mister.

234
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:20,412
What do you really
do with the money?

235
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:23,643
Give me 300 won
to buy a drink please.

236
00:28:52,577 --> 00:28:56,181
I saw you the other day.

237
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:58,316
You were sitting in front of the shop

238
00:28:58,316 --> 00:29:00,784
looking very tired.

239
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:18,737
Over your slumped shoulders

240
00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:21,797
was a dark cloud of Ioneliness.

241
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:25,010
That night... I met some friends and drank.

242
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,446
I even went to a karaoke bar.

243
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:30,649
I got back kind of depressed.

244
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:33,743
Did you read my letter?

245
00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:36,755
This is the fourth letter.

246
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:39,553
I wonder if it got to you okay.

247
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:41,726
Oould you let me know?

248
00:29:41,726 --> 00:29:44,696
To show that you've read it,

249
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:47,529
tape a blue paper on the window.

250
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,501
If it's not there,

251
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:52,671
I will know
you didn't read my letters,

252
00:29:52,671 --> 00:29:56,232
and I won't plan on carrying
this on any further.

253
00:29:56,575 --> 00:30:00,636
This could be my last letter.

254
00:30:17,662 --> 00:30:19,498
The wind is really blowing out there.

255
00:30:19,498 --> 00:30:22,901
Do you have
'The Ionely swordsman'?

256
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:24,936
It's not in yet.

257
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:30,465
What?
Found in video stores near you!

258
00:30:31,576 --> 00:30:35,637
That's what it said. Well, maybe it will be in soon, then.

259
00:30:36,014 --> 00:30:38,710
That's what I came to rent...

260
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:56,232
- thank you.
- Bye.

261
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:23,662
Three, and four...
Now, four more.

262
00:31:23,662 --> 00:31:25,597
This will develop your sphincter,

263
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:27,232
and help you
to improve sexual abilities.

264
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:30,201
Now, let's work on the legs...

265
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:40,202
- Hello.
- Hello.

266
00:31:48,887 --> 00:31:50,616
Hello.

267
00:31:57,062 --> 00:32:01,590
- How's this one?
- What is it?

268
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:05,863
- What's it called?

269
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:08,133
'Magic Sword'.

270
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:12,306
You look tired today.

271
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:16,507
I envy you.

272
00:32:16,615 --> 00:32:17,639
Pardon?

273
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:20,318
I wish that I could just

274
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:23,617
run a video shop like you.

275
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,490
It's not easy running a video shop.

276
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:30,962
You don't have to grovel

277
00:32:30,962 --> 00:32:33,294
before the suits above you.

278
00:32:40,472 --> 00:32:41,506
What's your name, sweetie?

279
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:43,804
- Dan-bi
- Dan-bi.

280
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:57,950
Bye now.

281
00:33:00,158 --> 00:33:05,528
Yes, video shop. It's not in yet, sorry.

282
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:42,600
Let's look over the answer sheet.

283
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,203
Student finds knowledge
through senses...

284
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:47,103
Student finds knowledge
through senses...

285
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:53,078
I bought a mini gas gun today.

286
00:33:53,078 --> 00:33:54,568
Want to see it?

287
00:33:56,948 --> 00:33:59,917
- Looks like a real gun.
- Doesn't it?

288
00:34:00,385 --> 00:34:03,616
I wanted to thank you
for the other night.

289
00:34:04,556 --> 00:34:05,750
No problem.

290
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:11,863
Studying the high school
equivalency exam?

291
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:14,265
No, I just wanted

292
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:16,597
to see what I learned long ago.

293
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:18,937
Oan you recommend me a movie?

294
00:34:18,937 --> 00:34:20,338
Oan you recommend me a movie?

295
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:22,941
I'm going to be a regular here.

296
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:24,533
Really?

297
00:34:29,614 --> 00:34:32,515
I don't know
if you'll like this one.

298
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:35,917
Oh... this one.

299
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:26,404
Mister, we finished
our exams today.

300
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:28,506
- Oh? Did well?
- Yes.

301
00:35:28,506 --> 00:35:30,942
Ah... I was wondering...

302
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:34,002
- Stop squirming and ask him.
- I know.

303
00:35:35,113 --> 00:35:39,641
Hey, Mister... um...

304
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:42,153
I'm not getting any younger here!

305
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:44,656
Mister, there's no one home
at her house now.

306
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:46,858
So, let us borrow an erotic video.

307
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:49,127
We'll return it quick, okay?

308
00:35:49,127 --> 00:35:51,629
You know the TV host of
'Our Sexuality'?

309
00:35:51,629 --> 00:35:53,631
She's my aunt, actually.

310
00:35:53,631 --> 00:35:55,567
- You guys know her too?
- Of course!

311
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:58,832
We'll watch
it as sexual education.

312
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:03,141
You want to see
this place closed down?

313
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:04,733
'Water Bed'?

314
00:36:04,943 --> 00:36:07,579
Oh, just this once, okay?

315
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:08,713
Mister...

316
00:36:08,713 --> 00:36:11,375
There are lots
of other videos here.

317
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:14,452
What shitty luck!

318
00:36:14,452 --> 00:36:17,489
This isn't the only
video shop around.

319
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:18,923
Super ultra shit luck.

320
00:36:18,923 --> 00:36:20,758
You know he likes to watch'em!

321
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:22,227
You little punks...

322
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:24,320
- Hey!
- It's snowing!

323
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:37,331
- Hello.
- Hi.

324
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:49,179
You have two videos out.
Is anything wrong?

325
00:36:50,288 --> 00:36:52,857
Did you happen to get a tape

326
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:55,325
that doesn't belong here?

327
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:58,096
My mom visited and

328
00:36:58,096 --> 00:37:00,098
she returned a tape by mistake.

329
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:02,862
She returned the wrong one.

330
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:12,410
It happens sometimes.

331
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,277
We even get a man's sixties
birthday party video

332
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:17,478
What happens then?

333
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:20,813
I just return it
to the rightful owner.

334
00:37:27,225 --> 00:37:30,161
I saw the blue paper
on the window.

335
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:33,289
My entire body shivered
when I saw it.

336
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:35,934
When I wrote to you,

337
00:37:35,934 --> 00:37:38,994
I thought
it was like writing in a diary.

338
00:37:39,203 --> 00:37:42,040
But with a colored piece of paper

339
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,776
you became real to me.

340
00:37:44,776 --> 00:37:47,768
Right now I feel
happy and nervous...

341
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:52,750
but at the same time
I'm confused.

342
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,844
How to take you now...

343
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:58,423
So, I have one request.

344
00:37:58,423 --> 00:38:00,058
I would like to

345
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:02,891
receive a letter from you.

346
00:38:03,428 --> 00:38:05,229
You can write anything.

347
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:08,266
Now that you're in my life

348
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:10,668
I just want to make you more real.

349
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,337
You can leave the letter

350
00:38:12,337 --> 00:38:15,707
behind the phone booth down the three-way junction.

351
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:18,676
It's been a while
since I wrote a letter.

352
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:20,511
You said I could write anything

353
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:22,376
so I'll write about movies.

354
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:27,151
Right now, in my life
videos are all there is.

355
00:38:40,264 --> 00:38:42,600
What are you doing?

356
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,968
Ah... nothing.

357
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,903
Then why are you hiding it?

358
00:38:45,903 --> 00:38:47,271
Never mind.

359
00:38:47,271 --> 00:38:49,671
Don't you need a part-timer?

360
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:53,244
- Not you.
- Why not?

361
00:38:53,244 --> 00:38:55,146
You're on my blacklist.

362
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:57,740
Why am I blacklisted?

363
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:03,688
You know
that song you always sing?

364
00:39:03,688 --> 00:39:06,680
Who sings it?
Oan you write it down?

365
00:39:06,858 --> 00:39:09,486
- Why?
- I need it for something.

366
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:16,734
- Here.
- No, in Korean.

367
00:39:16,734 --> 00:39:18,269
You don't know English?

368
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:20,567
Weren't you a law student?

369
00:39:21,806 --> 00:39:27,870
It figures... O.O.2, here.

370
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:29,476
Thanks.

371
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:43,828
- Hello?
- You're still there?

372
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:49,289
- Who's calling?
- It's me, Miss Shin.

373
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:53,000
What are you doing?

374
00:39:54,038 --> 00:39:56,598
Taking your call.

375
00:39:56,808 --> 00:40:00,111
I just decided to call and see how you are doing.

376
00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:04,514
- That's okay, isn't it?
- Yes.

377
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:08,112
I'll call again.
Take care.

378
00:42:31,796 --> 00:42:35,254
Mister, want to buy a card?

379
00:42:40,204 --> 00:42:45,836
I looked everywhere for it. But it's not here.

380
00:42:52,216 --> 00:42:53,818
What do you do
with the returned tapes?

381
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:55,453
What do you do
with the returned tapes?

382
00:42:55,453 --> 00:42:58,149
I rewind them first.

383
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:01,690
- You Do That, yourself, right?
- Yes.

384
00:43:01,893 --> 00:43:04,528
You don't check the tapes first?

385
00:43:04,528 --> 00:43:06,393
Of course I do.

386
00:43:10,268 --> 00:43:12,403
At times when I come in
with a hangover,

387
00:43:12,403 --> 00:43:15,839
I forget to check
and just put them in a case.

388
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:20,703
Then my tape could be...

389
00:43:21,112 --> 00:43:24,639
in one of the cases in here?

390
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,045
It's possible.

391
00:43:37,328 --> 00:43:41,094
Anyway I'll look for it again.

392
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:44,124
Would you?

393
00:44:06,857 --> 00:44:09,724
Give me 300 won
to buy a drink please.

394
00:44:10,194 --> 00:44:13,163
Give me 300 won
to buy a drink please.

395
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:39,784
Hello?

396
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,121
You've got the wrong number.

397
00:45:34,945 --> 00:45:36,914
You should've come sooner.

398
00:45:36,914 --> 00:45:39,246
Isn't this great?
It's even snowing.

399
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:42,853
You have to drink
on a day like this, don't you?

400
00:45:42,853 --> 00:45:45,723
This is worth 80,000 won

401
00:45:45,723 --> 00:45:48,325
so I'm paid up and then some.

402
00:45:48,325 --> 00:45:51,128
I'm serious. Look at this.

403
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:53,995
That's fine.
I didn't come for the food.

404
00:45:53,743 --> 00:45:55,645
You know how stressed
I got every time you came around?

405
00:45:55,645 --> 00:45:58,409
You know how stressed
I got every time you came around?

406
00:46:06,323 --> 00:46:08,951
It tastes so good, today!

407
00:46:09,693 --> 00:46:13,063
Must be nice repaying
your debts and drinking.

408
00:46:13,063 --> 00:46:15,725
Don't be so cheap.

409
00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:18,768
I'm drinking to pick up the mood.

410
00:46:19,002 --> 00:46:22,706
Do you remember the titles
of the tapes you lost?

411
00:46:22,706 --> 00:46:25,732
Well... part of it.

412
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:30,009
Then write down here
what you remember.

413
00:46:30,613 --> 00:46:32,048
Why?

414
00:46:32,048 --> 00:46:33,879
I don't remember, either.

415
00:46:49,966 --> 00:46:51,433
Here you are.

416
00:46:54,137 --> 00:46:58,096
Mister, now tell me
something funny.

417
00:47:00,677 --> 00:47:05,114
I don't know... You try it.

418
00:47:05,548 --> 00:47:07,717
Long ago in the palace,

419
00:47:07,717 --> 00:47:11,619
you know why the eunuchs failed
of forming a labor union?

420
00:47:12,122 --> 00:47:15,455
- I don't know.
- Of course you don't.

421
00:47:15,992 --> 00:47:17,761
If they're going to form a union,

422
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:20,196
If they're going to form a union,

423
00:47:20,196 --> 00:47:23,222
they need to rise up together.

424
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:28,032
But, you know
they just can't get it up!

425
00:47:29,506 --> 00:47:34,500
Isn't it hilarious?

426
00:47:39,916 --> 00:47:41,951
Oome in!

427
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:43,620
- Been a while, Miss Shin.
- Why didn't you stop by?

428
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,056
- Been a while, Miss Shin.
- Why didn't you stop by?

429
00:47:46,056 --> 00:47:47,857
Yeah, so that I can go broke?

430
00:47:47,857 --> 00:47:49,225
Yeah, so that I can go broke?

431
00:47:49,225 --> 00:47:51,056
You never came that much!

432
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:56,599
After the fat wife and the skinny hubby
finished dinner,

433
00:47:56,599 --> 00:47:58,468
she brought out a bowl and said,

434
00:47:58,468 --> 00:48:00,737
Honey, come here

435
00:48:00,737 --> 00:48:03,940
and drink this oriental medicine."

436
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,277
After the man ran away, refusing,

437
00:48:07,277 --> 00:48:09,612
she said "Oome back here, right now!"

438
00:48:09,612 --> 00:48:12,182
Know what he said to her then?

439
00:48:12,182 --> 00:48:15,618
He said, "No way! You just want

440
00:48:15,618 --> 00:48:18,416
to get your money's worth out of me."

441
00:48:21,991 --> 00:48:24,594
Right! That's the idea!

442
00:48:24,594 --> 00:48:26,926
So let me get my money's
worth with you.

443
00:48:27,097 --> 00:48:28,689
Please, don't.

444
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:32,031
Hey, you bitch!

445
00:48:32,235 --> 00:48:33,870
Who is this jerk?

446
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,839
I'm her man! Any problems?

447
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,206
- Are you crazy? Get out!
- Oome here!

448
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:45,445
- What Are you doing?
- Who the fuck Are you?

449
00:48:46,916 --> 00:48:48,781
Don't do that!

450
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,352
You bastard!

451
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:53,283
Asshole!

452
00:51:12,562 --> 00:51:15,554
I looked almost everywhere.

453
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,085
- I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

454
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:43,180
I guess this is useless.

455
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,655
I'll clean it up.

456
00:51:46,262 --> 00:51:51,200
I'm so sorry... I have to get going.

457
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,168
Goodbye.

458
00:51:56,105 --> 00:52:00,201
- Do you like your Video shop?
- Pardon?

459
00:52:02,612 --> 00:52:04,136
It's nothing.

460
00:52:04,881 --> 00:52:07,941
- Take care.
- Bye.

461
00:52:28,638 --> 00:52:31,207
Why'd you hide
someone else's video?

462
00:52:31,207 --> 00:52:33,710
You're a horrible man.

463
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,268
You're shameless!

464
00:53:47,553 --> 00:53:50,289
Maybe I'm watching
too many videos.

465
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:52,859
I'm having weird dreams these days.

466
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:55,695
I usually watch action or comedies.

467
00:53:55,695 --> 00:53:59,461
But when I dream, it turns into an art film.

468
00:54:50,516 --> 00:54:53,019
I'm dying of pent-up anger
toward my daughter-in-law.

469
00:54:53,019 --> 00:54:54,854
I'm dying of pent-up anger
toward my daughter-in-law.

470
00:54:54,854 --> 00:54:58,119
I don't think
I'll live out a natural life.

471
00:54:59,792 --> 00:55:04,286
Watch this, and she won't
be able to live out her life.

472
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:11,100
My wife's having an affair.

473
00:55:18,344 --> 00:55:20,480
I want to see...

474
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,813
what a woman looks like.

475
00:55:28,688 --> 00:55:31,748
This shows a lot of women.

476
00:55:39,065 --> 00:55:42,967
I'm... pregnant.

477
00:55:45,638 --> 00:55:47,840
Should've been more careful.

478
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,277
Oops, that's a porno video
with the same title.

479
00:55:51,277 --> 00:55:53,108
I'll take that back.

480
00:55:55,548 --> 00:55:57,884
Here's Park Ohul-Soo's
'PUSH! PUSH! '

481
00:55:57,884 --> 00:56:00,876
Ohoose a good obstetrician.

482
00:56:03,122 --> 00:56:06,922
Who took my video?

483
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,928
You lost it

484
00:56:08,928 --> 00:56:11,130
because you were careless.

485
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:14,566
If it doesn't appear, give it up.

486
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,446
I told a lie.

487
00:56:31,217 --> 00:56:34,720
How can I give
her back the video...

488
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,053
so that she won't
suspect anything?

489
00:56:47,567 --> 00:56:48,898
Yes? Video shop.

490
00:56:49,602 --> 00:56:55,308
Mister! Did you know that I still
have the bottle you left behind?

491
00:56:55,308 --> 00:56:58,144
Mister! Did you know that I still
have the bottle you left behind?

492
00:56:58,144 --> 00:57:00,680
I'm so sorry.

493
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,683
Were you hurt
because of me that night?

494
00:57:03,683 --> 00:57:05,518
Miss Shin.

495
00:57:05,518 --> 00:57:08,788
What? Don't want to talk?

496
00:57:08,788 --> 00:57:12,058
Too bad.

497
00:57:12,058 --> 00:57:14,260
As long as I'm alive
I'll keep calling.

498
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,262
Ah, Miss Shin?

499
00:57:16,262 --> 00:57:19,527
Yes, I'm listening, boss.

500
00:57:20,132 --> 00:57:22,535
You sound like you're drunk.

501
00:57:22,535 --> 00:57:25,972
I'll come by in a few days.

502
00:57:25,972 --> 00:57:28,463
Do you think I'll believe that?

503
00:57:28,774 --> 00:57:32,972
I never saw a man
who said he'll come, ever come.

504
00:57:33,613 --> 00:57:35,748
And I never saw a liar

505
00:57:35,748 --> 00:57:38,512
who wasn't cheap.

506
00:57:42,555 --> 00:57:47,492
I'm sorry, mister.

507
00:57:47,793 --> 00:57:51,285
I didn't mean you.

508
00:57:51,464 --> 00:57:54,797
You're a good man
who cannot tell a lie.

509
00:57:55,001 --> 00:57:59,961
- Oome by soon.
- I will.

510
00:58:00,072 --> 00:58:01,562
- I'll let you go.
- Bye.

511
00:58:37,576 --> 00:58:41,569
Excuse me. Are you okay?

512
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:53,359
I want... to go to Yangsuri,

513
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:57,557
and the Korean Folk Village.

514
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,333
In some movie,

515
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:10,031
I saw some lovers go there.

516
00:59:10,776 --> 00:59:14,303
It seemed really nice.

517
00:59:15,348 --> 00:59:19,151
Later when I meet
someone special,

518
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:23,747
I'll be sure to go there with him.

519
00:59:26,826 --> 00:59:31,729
Miss Shin, it's cold
and you should get home.

520
00:59:33,499 --> 00:59:39,165
Home? What home?

521
00:59:40,873 --> 00:59:43,637
What's wrong with your face?

522
00:59:44,377 --> 00:59:51,647
Mister... Why is life so hard?

523
01:01:31,917 --> 01:01:33,908
Did you sleep well?

524
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:37,022
Sorry to put you through
all the trouble.

525
01:01:37,022 --> 01:01:38,785
You're okay?

526
01:01:42,862 --> 01:01:48,232
I made you breakfast at home.
Go and eat.

527
01:01:49,301 --> 01:01:51,064
Breakfast?

528
01:01:52,338 --> 01:01:54,465
I'll be going now.

529
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,373
Oh... hey!

530
01:01:57,376 --> 01:01:58,343
Wait a sec.

531
01:02:07,386 --> 01:02:10,219
Mister, what are you thinking?

532
01:02:12,091 --> 01:02:15,083
What do you think life is?

533
01:02:15,194 --> 01:02:16,752
Life?

534
01:02:20,399 --> 01:02:22,230
Life is...

535
01:02:22,568 --> 01:02:24,297
An egg.

536
01:02:26,939 --> 01:02:28,270
Have some!

537
01:02:30,943 --> 01:02:32,410
Isn't it good?

538
01:02:35,681 --> 01:02:37,546
I'm so bored.

539
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:40,312
He must've been bored too.

540
01:02:58,871 --> 01:03:02,141
The things he demands...

541
01:03:02,141 --> 01:03:05,344
may be entirely reasonable.

542
01:03:05,344 --> 01:03:06,946
I have things...

543
01:03:06,946 --> 01:03:09,682
that are important to me too...

544
01:03:09,682 --> 01:03:12,117
My work,

545
01:03:12,117 --> 01:03:13,819
the baby to come,

546
01:03:13,819 --> 01:03:16,652
finances...

547
01:03:17,022 --> 01:03:19,625
I don't know.

548
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:22,328
Now I'm thirty...

549
01:03:22,328 --> 01:03:25,164
When I see the blue sky
just like now,

550
01:03:25,164 --> 01:03:27,860
I become sad for no reason.

551
01:03:30,402 --> 01:03:34,361
This is really great!
Aren't you glad we came?

552
01:03:34,506 --> 01:03:36,242
It's all thanks to you.

553
01:03:36,242 --> 01:03:38,344
No, thanks to you.

554
01:03:38,344 --> 01:03:42,715
Oompared to staying
in that musty old bar,

555
01:03:42,715 --> 01:03:45,206
it's great to be out
in a wide open place.

556
01:03:46,852 --> 01:03:55,089
Spring, silence, noise... depressed, goodbye.

557
01:03:55,194 --> 01:03:59,062
Poor guy, he got dumped.

558
01:04:03,335 --> 01:04:06,304
The owner's not around today?

559
01:04:06,472 --> 01:04:08,707
He left me in charge today.

560
01:04:08,707 --> 01:04:10,675
I'm working for him.

561
01:04:10,843 --> 01:04:12,970
When did he go out?

562
01:04:13,212 --> 01:04:15,581
Early this morning.

563
01:04:15,581 --> 01:04:17,640
Do you have to return a video?

564
01:04:19,551 --> 01:04:21,143
No.

565
01:04:42,908 --> 01:04:45,877
He didn't say
when he'll be back?

566
01:04:46,145 --> 01:04:48,280
It'll be soon.

567
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,749
He pays me 1, 500 won an hour.

568
01:04:50,749 --> 01:04:53,252
He's really stingy with money.

569
01:04:53,252 --> 01:04:55,482
Probably on his way back now. No.

570
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:05,761
Phone number?

571
01:05:06,498 --> 01:05:10,025
You don't know
how hard I had to work.

572
01:05:10,936 --> 01:05:12,638
I swear...

573
01:05:12,638 --> 01:05:16,342
I'll meet a nice guy like you,

574
01:05:16,342 --> 01:05:19,436
and get married first
then take him to my parents.

575
01:05:20,112 --> 01:05:23,980
I'm sure you'll
meet a great guy.

576
01:05:31,857 --> 01:05:33,324
What?

577
01:05:44,903 --> 01:05:46,271
This is hot!

578
01:05:46,271 --> 01:05:49,074
Ma'am, this hot pepper soup
is really hot!

579
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:52,444
Of course, that's why
it's called 'hot pepper soup'.

580
01:05:52,444 --> 01:05:56,210
So spicy.

581
01:05:58,584 --> 01:06:02,520
Yes, stationery store... Video shop.

582
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:10,888
Yes. Fifteen checked out
and seven returned.

583
01:06:12,331 --> 01:06:14,629
And the pretty lady came by.

584
01:06:14,867 --> 01:06:17,267
Pretty lady? Who?

585
01:06:17,569 --> 01:06:19,127
I don't know.

586
01:06:19,338 --> 01:06:21,440
She just asked for you

587
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,533
and rented a video.

588
01:06:23,709 --> 01:06:25,344
What did she rent?

589
01:06:25,344 --> 01:06:27,505
'I wish I had a wife'

590
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:29,314
Nothing else?

591
01:06:29,314 --> 01:06:30,975
No.

592
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:35,183
You know it's 1, 500 won
an hour, right?

593
01:06:35,587 --> 01:06:37,384
Mister!

594
01:06:44,329 --> 01:06:46,627
Thank you for today.

595
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:50,363
- Go ahead.
- Bye.

596
01:06:52,838 --> 01:06:54,203
Mister!

597
01:06:56,341 --> 01:06:59,333
Why did you want
to go to Yangsuri?

598
01:07:00,078 --> 01:07:03,707
You don't remember
what you said before?

599
01:07:04,349 --> 01:07:08,887
You said you envied a couple
in a movie who went there.

600
01:07:08,887 --> 01:07:11,048
I said that?

601
01:07:15,794 --> 01:07:20,959
Did I mention anywhere else
besides Yangsuri?

602
01:07:34,213 --> 01:07:36,078
Oan I ask something?

603
01:07:36,215 --> 01:07:37,580
What is it?

604
01:07:37,716 --> 01:07:40,819
'Far away... '
What song comes to mind?

605
01:07:40,819 --> 01:07:42,582
'Far away'?

606
01:07:42,988 --> 01:07:47,118
'Far away the whistle blows... '

607
01:07:48,293 --> 01:07:50,295
I knew it.

608
01:07:50,295 --> 01:07:53,230
That's why you're
old generation, mister.

609
01:07:53,499 --> 01:07:57,836
Younger generations sing like this:
'Far away... '

610
01:07:57,836 --> 01:08:01,328
'Go even farther away from me... '

611
01:08:20,492 --> 01:08:23,427
- Hello?
- It's been a while.

612
01:08:23,829 --> 01:08:26,231
The last time, you weren't here.

613
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:30,133
I left the city with a friend to get some fresh air.

614
01:08:31,637 --> 01:08:33,772
- Video shop.
- It's me.

615
01:08:33,772 --> 01:08:36,375
- Doing okay?
- Sure. And you, honey?

616
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:38,343
I'm doing well.
Did you get lunch?

617
01:08:38,343 --> 01:08:40,012
I snacked a bit.

618
01:08:40,012 --> 01:08:42,581
Be sure to eat well.

619
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:44,049
I will.

620
01:08:44,049 --> 01:08:47,619
And I'm ready to move on.

621
01:08:47,619 --> 01:08:49,388
That's good.

622
01:08:49,388 --> 01:08:52,457
We really are better apart
I think.

623
01:08:52,457 --> 01:08:54,660
Oan we meet for tea occasionally?

624
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,061
Sure.

625
01:08:56,061 --> 01:08:58,530
Drink some milk
or something to fill up.

626
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:01,099
What song comes
to mind for 'far away'?

627
01:09:01,099 --> 01:09:02,668
Far away?

628
01:09:02,668 --> 01:09:05,170
'The whistle blows'. Why?

629
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:09,641
It's nothing. Take care and call me every so often.

630
01:09:09,641 --> 01:09:12,838
- I'll call again.
- Alright. Bye.

631
01:09:17,149 --> 01:09:20,812
Sounds like a girlfriend.
Did you break up?

632
01:09:24,122 --> 01:09:28,991
After 'far away'...
it's 'the whistle blows', right?

633
01:09:30,362 --> 01:09:33,498
But these days it's...

634
01:09:33,498 --> 01:09:36,661
Far way, I saw you... '

635
01:10:18,844 --> 01:10:23,008
At an age when I can't
love without sinning... '

636
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:25,779
There's a poem like that.

637
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:28,984
A poem?

638
01:10:30,589 --> 01:10:34,292
At an age when I can't
love without sinning... '

639
01:10:34,292 --> 01:10:38,058
I really like that line.
And also,

640
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:43,133
'The farthest road in life is returning
to the one from whence you came.'

641
01:10:45,137 --> 01:10:47,833
What is 'the road
from whence you came'?

642
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:55,180
The beginning somewhere,
I suppose.

643
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:58,050
But life is about returning

644
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:00,752
to where one came from.

645
01:11:00,752 --> 01:11:04,779
When someone dies they say
he's returned to the other world.

646
01:11:05,857 --> 01:11:07,722
That's true.

647
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:14,294
Did you have dinner?

648
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:16,725
I did earlier. Did you?

649
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:21,773
I often go to a publishing house
because of work.

650
01:11:21,773 --> 01:11:23,742
The OEO there was my school senior.

651
01:11:23,742 --> 01:11:25,811
I couldn't say no to dinner.

652
01:11:25,811 --> 01:11:29,144
I see. Do you write?

653
01:11:31,049 --> 01:11:34,853
I've collected some past works.

654
01:11:34,853 --> 01:11:37,219
It'll be published soon.

655
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:39,985
I see.

656
01:11:42,227 --> 01:11:44,058
What's wrong?

657
01:11:44,162 --> 01:11:47,833
Oh, I thought I'd count.

658
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:51,963
How many times
you say "I see"

659
01:11:52,871 --> 01:11:57,899
It's a bad habit... I see.

660
01:12:05,016 --> 01:12:10,215
It was an accident
on the way back from a trip.

661
01:12:11,957 --> 01:12:15,984
The way lovers live...

662
01:12:18,864 --> 01:12:23,961
My husband wanted
to capture that.

663
01:12:25,403 --> 01:12:29,897
I felt better
when I saw that tape...

664
01:12:36,648 --> 01:12:38,750
That's why I wanted...

665
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:40,252
That tape...

666
01:12:40,252 --> 01:12:44,022
When you look at people
who like videos,

667
01:12:44,022 --> 01:12:48,693
they tend to have
special stories behind why,

668
01:12:48,693 --> 01:12:53,392
in most cases...

669
01:14:16,615 --> 01:14:17,949
Hey, mister!

670
01:14:17,949 --> 01:14:21,286
Business picked up?
You bought new clothes.

671
01:14:21,286 --> 01:14:23,388
It picked up a little.

672
01:14:23,388 --> 01:14:26,324
Hey, did you hear about
the murder last night?

673
01:14:26,324 --> 01:14:29,427
Some woman our neighborhood...

674
01:14:29,427 --> 01:14:31,129
got stabbed by someone chasing
her around at night.

675
01:14:31,129 --> 01:14:32,864
Got stabbed by someone chasing
her around at night.

676
01:14:32,864 --> 01:14:35,697
They say
it's a case of infatuation.

677
01:14:36,234 --> 01:14:38,065
- Really?
- Yes.

678
01:14:38,169 --> 01:14:40,194
Don't you read the papers?

679
01:15:19,678 --> 01:15:25,412
Some things don't ever come
no matter how long you wait.

680
01:15:25,917 --> 01:15:29,621
Once I realized that
I felt a lot better.

681
01:15:29,621 --> 01:15:33,158
Actually, there's a person
who sends me letters.

682
01:15:33,158 --> 01:15:35,961
Who did send me letters.

683
01:15:35,961 --> 01:15:38,293
What letters?

684
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:41,993
The kind a woman sends to a man...

685
01:15:42,033 --> 01:15:44,331
Love letters, then.

686
01:15:51,009 --> 01:15:55,036
So, how did you feel?

687
01:15:55,447 --> 01:15:59,084
A little confused but...

688
01:15:59,084 --> 01:16:03,521
after a while
it wasn't bad at all.

689
01:16:03,788 --> 01:16:06,291
First I was really curious
who it was, but not now.

690
01:16:06,291 --> 01:16:10,625
I don't know if it was her.

691
01:16:11,062 --> 01:16:13,565
What are you going to do about it?

692
01:16:13,565 --> 01:16:16,701
I'm not sure.

693
01:16:16,701 --> 01:16:18,726
Why not?

694
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:27,106
I'm comfortable as is, now.

695
01:16:28,279 --> 01:16:30,648
You like living by yourself?

696
01:16:30,648 --> 01:16:33,139
Not necessarily,

697
01:16:33,284 --> 01:16:36,310
but I think it suits me.

698
01:16:39,024 --> 01:16:41,390
I envy you.

699
01:16:46,664 --> 01:16:49,997
Are you satisfied with your life now?

700
01:16:51,202 --> 01:16:52,829
Yes, I am.

701
01:16:57,375 --> 01:17:00,078
You seem quite sure of yourself.

702
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:06,651
Unlike others
I don't really have...

703
01:17:06,651 --> 01:17:10,052
any special goals or dreams in life.

704
01:17:10,221 --> 01:17:13,925
A dream is like...

705
01:17:13,925 --> 01:17:17,062
telling me that
I'm missing something now.

706
01:17:17,062 --> 01:17:21,863
That can't be a satisfying life.

707
01:17:33,078 --> 01:17:35,012
Have some more.

708
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:15,476
What are you thinking of?

709
01:18:16,721 --> 01:18:18,556
When I look at dust

710
01:18:18,556 --> 01:18:21,548
I can feel time passing by.

711
01:18:27,866 --> 01:18:29,925
I guess you're right.

712
01:18:33,805 --> 01:18:35,670
You alright?

713
01:20:29,487 --> 01:20:32,979
A first affair is fate.

714
01:20:33,057 --> 01:20:35,660
I just recalled that saying.

715
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:37,829
Do you think so?

716
01:20:37,829 --> 01:20:41,466
I do, no matter what happens...

717
01:20:41,466 --> 01:20:44,663
A first affair is all
because of fate.

718
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:49,201
Then what about
the second and thereafter?

719
01:20:49,907 --> 01:20:53,570
They're not fate?

720
01:20:57,515 --> 01:21:00,318
The person who sent you letters...

721
01:21:00,318 --> 01:21:03,151
What do you think of her?

722
01:21:04,489 --> 01:21:07,322
Nothing bad.

723
01:21:08,459 --> 01:21:11,485
Don't you wonder who she is?

724
01:21:12,363 --> 01:21:15,933
Before I knew you, Hye-Jung, I did.

725
01:21:15,933 --> 01:21:18,803
If she heard that, she'd be sad.

726
01:21:18,803 --> 01:21:22,307
It's not the woman
behind the letters,

727
01:21:22,307 --> 01:21:25,743
it's the one standing
before me who's important.

728
01:21:25,743 --> 01:21:27,145
Well, when I first saw you
on the tape, I didn't think...

729
01:21:27,145 --> 01:21:31,047
Well, when I first saw you
on the tape, I didn't think...

730
01:21:43,194 --> 01:21:44,627
Hye-Jung...

731
01:23:41,612 --> 01:23:44,172
Please return the tapes in the drop box.

732
01:23:45,616 --> 01:23:49,487
Sad autumn falls like leaves
here and there.

733
01:23:49,487 --> 01:23:52,890
The ones that dropped
the leaves prepare for spring.

734
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:56,794
Above the branches
the sky is wide open.

735
01:23:56,794 --> 01:24:00,331
Looking closely at the sky...

736
01:24:00,331 --> 01:24:03,562
eyelashes become stained in blue.
Wash cheeks with warm hands and...

737
01:24:37,101 --> 01:24:38,500
Hello?

738
01:24:40,838 --> 01:24:42,703
No, it's not released yet.

739
01:25:00,725 --> 01:25:03,489
The person you're
calling is not available...

740
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,991
- Bye.
- Bye.

741
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:01,576
Hello. A letter for you.

742
01:27:02,513 --> 01:27:04,003
Thank you.

743
01:27:26,837 --> 01:27:28,806
That day
I went into the motel.

744
01:27:28,806 --> 01:27:31,707
I wasn't acting on impulse.

745
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:35,946
I always waited for something

746
01:27:35,946 --> 01:27:37,880
to change my life.

747
01:27:38,849 --> 01:27:40,451
I wasn't necessarily waiting

748
01:27:40,451 --> 01:27:42,544
for a man or a relationship.

749
01:27:42,887 --> 01:27:46,290
But when I first saw you, I thought,

750
01:27:46,290 --> 01:27:48,993
maybe you're the one
I'm waiting for,

751
01:27:48,993 --> 01:27:52,053
that something will
change my life with you.

752
01:27:52,396 --> 01:27:54,598
I think my first letter to you

753
01:27:54,598 --> 01:27:57,328
started in that hope.

754
01:27:57,702 --> 01:28:00,371
But it seemed to me,

755
01:28:00,371 --> 01:28:03,704
you didn't seem to want anything.

756
01:28:03,774 --> 01:28:06,911
I think that you were right.

757
01:28:06,911 --> 01:28:08,746
Fate...

758
01:28:08,746 --> 01:28:12,045
It's just the moment of beginning.

759
01:28:12,383 --> 01:28:17,480
Once it starts
there's nothing more that's new.

760
01:28:17,722 --> 01:28:20,091
Anyway, since I met my fate.

761
01:28:20,091 --> 01:28:22,893
I guess there's no need
to meet again.

762
01:28:22,893 --> 01:28:24,417
Goodbye.

Essays by Park Hye-Jung

765
01:29:58,055 --> 01:30:00,891
- Yes?
- It's me.

766
01:30:00,891 --> 01:30:05,162
I'm going to America next week.

767
01:30:05,162 --> 01:30:07,264
What for?

768
01:30:07,264 --> 01:30:10,427
I'm going with him there.

769
01:30:11,035 --> 01:30:15,995
So soon? We should meet then.

770
01:30:16,273 --> 01:30:19,174
I'll see you before I go.

771
01:30:19,677 --> 01:30:22,043
You take care.

772
01:30:23,047 --> 01:30:24,674
You too.

773
01:30:28,152 --> 01:30:30,087
You like Meg Ryan.
She's in it.

774
01:30:30,087 --> 01:30:31,589
I never said I liked her.

775
01:30:31,589 --> 01:30:33,921
I just said that she's cute.

776
01:30:35,426 --> 01:30:37,261
There's a sequel out!

777
01:30:37,261 --> 01:30:39,096
I didn't see the first one.

778
01:30:39,096 --> 01:30:41,223
Oan't we watch it?

779
01:30:41,599 --> 01:30:44,468
Just take them both.

780
01:30:44,468 --> 01:30:46,459
I'll give you one for free.

781
01:30:52,676 --> 01:30:54,769
Thank you so much.

782
01:31:03,654 --> 01:31:06,557
Excuse me?

783
01:31:06,557 --> 01:31:09,260
Is the Folk Village open
this time of year?

784
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:12,457
Of course.
We were there not long ago.

785
01:31:12,563 --> 01:31:14,622
- Really?
- See you later.

786
01:31:14,698 --> 01:31:15,995
Goodbye.

787
01:34:35,699 --> 01:34:36,867
It's not in yet.

788
01:34:36,867 --> 01:34:38,702
They promised to bring it in today.

789
01:34:38,702 --> 01:34:41,262
You'll have to wait a few days
for that one.

790
01:34:41,705 --> 01:34:44,641
Did you see 'The Accidental Spy'?

791
01:34:44,641 --> 01:34:47,633
It's better than 'Oharlie's Angels'.

792
01:34:48,612 --> 01:34:50,671
Yes, Goodbye.

793
01:34:50,881 --> 01:34:52,916
Oh no, it was just rented.

794
01:34:52,916 --> 01:34:55,885
Have you seen
'Mission impossible 2'?

795
01:34:56,887 --> 01:34:58,589
Really?

796
01:34:58,589 --> 01:35:00,352
Yes, Goodbye.
