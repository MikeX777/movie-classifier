1
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,648
A prima ballerina
is a ballet dancer,

2
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,652
the chief ballet dancer,
the most important dancer of all,

3
00:00:56,902 --> 00:00:58,945
who dances all by herself.

4
00:01:06,452 --> 00:01:10,622
The marvellous, mechanical
prima ballerina.

5
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,630
Morning. Morning.
Anybody for Mass this morning?

6
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,386
Mass? No?

7
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,431
Do you want to go to Mass?

8
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:26,727
The toilet?

9
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:30,563
Try this.

10
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:36,485
First line?

11
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:38,987
A? B? C? C.

12
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:41,864
First line? Second... CA?

13
00:02:42,115 --> 00:02:45,284
First line? Second line? First line?

14
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:47,244
Cab?

15
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:49,162
First line? Second line?

16
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:51,539
Look at these, aren't they beautiful?

17
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:53,332
Cable?

18
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:55,751
Oh, my God.

19
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,503
Jesus. Annie! Annie!

20
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:06,093
Bagpuss gave a big yawn
and settled down to sleep.

21
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:42,373
Hello, Rory.

22
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,834
My name is Eileen Sheehy.

23
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:47,753
I hope you're at home with us
here at Carrigmore.

24
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:51,297
- Do I get a front-door key?
- We don't give front-door keys out.

25
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:53,299
It's not home then, is it?

26
00:03:55,342 --> 00:03:57,302
Hello, everybody.

27
00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:02,015
We have Rory O'Shea,
who's come to live with us for a while.

28
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:05,100
Now, just introduce yourself, Rory.

29
00:04:06,852 --> 00:04:09,979
Rory O'Shea.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

30
00:04:10,396 --> 00:04:13,608
Besides the full vocal range,
I have the use of two fingers,

31
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:16,652
sufficient for self-propulsion
and self-abuse.

32
00:04:16,902 --> 00:04:20,697
Shake my hand or kiss my arse,
but don't expect me to reciprocate.

33
00:04:20,905 --> 00:04:23,449
We don't tolerate
coarse language here, Rory.

34
00:04:30,955 --> 00:04:34,583
Is it always this much fun,
or is today's somebody's birthday?

35
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,510
Was the penthouse not available?

36
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:50,096
This is the only room.
People are queuing to get in.

37
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:52,306
And dying to get out.

38
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:55,934
I suppose it's only
a temporary arrangement.

39
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,652
Would you like
to go to bed now, Michael?

40
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:33,716
- Well?
- Not at all.

41
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,968
- What?
- Not a whisper.

42
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:06,493
- Is Dexter ill today?
- Dexter's in school.

43
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:08,703
I'm afraid he's not, Miss Fishborne.

44
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:11,372
Dexter's truancy problem
is way out of hand.

45
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:14,542
The Baltimore County School Board
have decided to expel Dexter

46
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,877
from the entire public school system.

47
00:06:28,428 --> 00:06:29,929
All right.

48
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:40,730
Rory, you can't play loud music
in the middle of the night.

49
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,940
Have you no respect for the others?

50
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,359
They haven't earned my respect.

51
00:06:45,818 --> 00:06:47,361
That's my music.

52
00:06:47,778 --> 00:06:50,363
That's my fucking music!
I need to listen to that!

53
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:53,699
If you continue this behaviour
I'll have to take this.

54
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:56,452
I'm getting my own home soon anyway.

55
00:06:56,702 --> 00:07:00,580
Until you do, you're here, OK?
And there are rules here.

56
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,668
Aggression. Shouting.
Singing in the middle of the night? No!

57
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,712
Have you no consideration
for other people?

58
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:12,340
If they can hear me, at least
they know they're fucking alive.

59
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:18,970
If you're alive, shout! Shout if you're
alive! Free the Carrigmore fucking One.

60
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:22,682
Somebody shout!
She's stolen my stereo! It's robbery!

61
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,820
Are you going to paint something, Rory?

62
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:42,615
Give us that.

63
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:51,456
Finished.

64
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:58,211
What are you looking at, Mary?

65
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,384
My Swahili's a bit off the boil.
Do you speak any English?

66
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:08,678
Use your card, for Christ's sake!

67
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:10,722
I'll take that.

68
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:13,724
It's got the alphabet on it.
He spells out words.

69
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:16,435
- Does it take long?
- Half the fucking day.

70
00:08:16,685 --> 00:08:18,603
- Language, Tommy.
- Are you worth it?

71
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:21,814
Are you worth the effort?

72
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:24,275
Is there a mind in there?

73
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:27,277
Cerebral palsy. Fucks your brain.

74
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:31,030
- Don't expect Einstein.
- You'd be Stephen Hawking then?

75
00:08:31,281 --> 00:08:35,367
There's nothing wrong with my brain.
It's the rest of me that's bollocksed.

76
00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:37,202
Ran my bike into a tree.

77
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:39,746
Is that your most
intelligent act to date?

78
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:41,998
Fuck off, the pair of you.

79
00:09:11,856 --> 00:09:13,774
You all right?

80
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:18,278
We've got to take your measurement for
the sleep system we were talking about.

81
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,614
I'm going to try to get you
as straight as possible.

82
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:24,158
Just relax.

83
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:26,785
Just try to relax there. OK?

84
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:30,246
So left side, 40.

85
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:34,458
- 44.
- 44.

86
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,126
Yeah.

87
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,005
Right side, 39.

88
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,300
49.

89
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,510
You all right, Michael?

90
00:09:55,476 --> 00:09:58,186
- How are yous?
- Are you looking for something, Rory?

91
00:09:58,603 --> 00:09:59,896
Nah.

92
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:10,697
Are you enjoying that?

93
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:14,575
You're all right.
Do you want me to get your card?

94
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:18,995
I'll get your card.

95
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:21,748
It's all right,
he just wants me to go away.

96
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,166
He says I'm driving him up the wall.

97
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,418
Love to see you try that one, Mary.

98
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,129
- Did you understand what he said?
- Yeah.

99
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,507
OK, smart boy, guess who this is.

100
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,175
Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger.

101
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:40,263
- Emperor Hirohito of Japan.
- Emperor...

102
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:43,683
It's Roger Moore, you dope.
Here, I've a good one for you.

103
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:45,893
Who am I being now?

104
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:51,356
Er, don't know, Tommy,
who are you being now?

105
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:53,858
Michael Connolly.

106
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,111
How are you, Michael?

107
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:03,449
Er, yeah, I can understand you.

108
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,368
How?

109
00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:08,870
I spent six years in a class
next to a kid

110
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,040
that makes you sound like
Laurence fucking Olivier.

111
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,251
What's he say now?

112
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:19,087
I think he said you were a prick.

113
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,173
Ah, fuck off, the pair of yous.

114
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,758
Look at you.

115
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:32,723
Will I tell...

116
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,270
Will I tell people what you say
with my gift?

117
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:42,023
- My gift.
- Would you like your bath now?

118
00:11:42,273 --> 00:11:44,233
Only if you wash my gift.

119
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:49,070
My gift.

120
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:51,489
I'll give you a fucking gift.

121
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,293
Annie, my hair gel's in the bag.

122
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:12,215
Sorry, Mrs Sheehy says we haven't the
time to tease those spikes every day.

123
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,646
Mary. Look what that bitch Delilah's
done to me.

124
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,940
What are you laughing at?

125
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,610
Not too much.
Are you listening to me?

126
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:41,155
Start with the back of the head.

127
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:48,620
You should think about
sprucing your image up a bit, Mary.

128
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:50,872
It's all about looks these days.

129
00:12:51,122 --> 00:12:53,874
Who buys your clothes for you?

130
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,125
Annie?

131
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:58,045
Jesus. Have you ever
looked at what she wears?

132
00:12:58,295 --> 00:13:00,547
Do you not go and shop for yourself?

133
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:07,969
I suppose you don't get out much,
do you?

134
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:13,557
What's out there?

135
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:15,768
Out there is out there.

136
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:17,978
I should be out there.

137
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:21,856
Don't you want to be like everyone else?

138
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,276
You know, get drunk...

139
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:28,403
...get arrested, get laid.

140
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:30,572
Huh?

141
00:13:37,953 --> 00:13:41,039
How long you been living
in places like this?

142
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:43,624
All your life?

143
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:47,002
What crime did you commit?

144
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:51,297
Unarmed robbery?

145
00:13:54,592 --> 00:13:57,552
Bit of a comedian,
are we, Mary?

146
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:04,058
Bottle of ketchup. An onion.

147
00:14:05,392 --> 00:14:09,312
Eileen.
See you've had your hair done as well.

148
00:14:12,106 --> 00:14:14,150
Fashion's a cruel mistress.

149
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:54,016
- Very cosy, Son.
- It'll do for now.

150
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:58,895
Hey, come and meet my friend.
Dad, this is Hugh Grant.

151
00:14:59,187 --> 00:15:01,439
Pleased to meet you, Hugh.
How you doing?

152
00:15:04,859 --> 00:15:06,819
He says he likes your hat.

153
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:09,571
- It's funny you mention this hat.
- Dad.

154
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:14,492
This is a fine, big room
you have here, Hugh.

155
00:15:14,742 --> 00:15:16,827
Fair play to you.

156
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:19,996
Oh, they're lovely.
Did you do them yourself?

157
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:22,206
Dad, are you coming for a cup of tea?

158
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:25,292
Right, Son. See you later, Hugh.

159
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:28,295
Nice fella.

160
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:44,058
- Did you see them on Wednesday?
- Nah.

161
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:46,643
They don't have cable here.

162
00:15:46,894 --> 00:15:49,229
- I watched it in Mullins.
- Did you, yeah?

163
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:53,024
They're very leaky at the back.

164
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:55,401
And they've no width. None at all.

165
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:05,826
This is better than the last place.

166
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:09,287
They're all the same.

167
00:16:12,457 --> 00:16:14,583
- How's your breathing?
- In and out.

168
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:21,798
- If you wanted to come home...
- I'm all right, Dad.

169
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:24,425
- It'd be no trouble.
- I'm all right.

170
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,348
Dad.

171
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:38,770
Couldn't lend us some money,
could you?

172
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:41,022
I want to buy a suit.

173
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,740
My dad?

174
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,950
Did you have a good look at him?

175
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:57,286
He can barely look after himself.

176
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:03,124
What about you?
Where are your parents?

177
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,477
Fergus Connolly.

178
00:17:26,894 --> 00:17:28,395
Is that your dad?

179
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:33,107
Does he come to see you?

180
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,861
And your mother?

181
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:46,243
She died and he dumped you?

182
00:17:48,078 --> 00:17:50,038
What a bastard.

183
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,626
Does he know he has a secret fan club?

184
00:17:58,753 --> 00:18:03,216
Go on! Help the poor unfortunates.
Earn your place in heaven.

185
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:08,053
You buy a cripple a Harley Davidson
you reduce the dependant population.

186
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:10,305
Hey, how are you, love?
How are you?

187
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,057
Give us some money.
You've got lovely legs.

188
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:16,977
Hey, get your eyes off her.
I saw her first.

189
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:19,979
- You filthy mongrel.
- Thanks a lot.

190
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,320
I've had more girlfriends
than you've had speech therapy sessions.

191
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,991
I'm not exactly built
for long-term relationships.

192
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:37,411
Anyhow, what about you?
Have you ever had your end away?

193
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:42,331
Saving yourself
for the big wedding night, are you?

194
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,583
Very romantic, Michael.

195
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,085
Thank you.

196
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:48,753
Follow me.
I'll show you some real romance.

197
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:12,482
Here, this'll do.

198
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:15,609
See anyone you fancy?

199
00:19:22,824 --> 00:19:24,992
Over there.

200
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:27,786
Keep your mouth shut.
I'll do the talking.

201
00:19:32,623 --> 00:19:36,627
Congratulations, you've been chosen
cripple companions of the month.

202
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:40,713
I'm Rory, this is Michael, and we come
bearing treasure in our laps.

203
00:19:40,922 --> 00:19:43,466
- I've got a badge already.
- Here's the deal.

204
00:19:43,758 --> 00:19:47,094
We buy the drinks, you hold them for us.
How does that sound?

205
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:51,889
- Sounds all right.
- Excellent. Take it out of this.

206
00:19:57,936 --> 00:20:01,314
No. It's for funding
the needs of the disabled.

207
00:20:01,564 --> 00:20:03,524
I'm disabled and I need a drink.

208
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:07,027
Life is dishonest, Michael.

209
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,369
There you go.

210
00:20:18,453 --> 00:20:19,996
Thanks.

211
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:53,649
We're in a show.
He sings, I dance.

212
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:55,984
- I don't believe you.
- You better.

213
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:59,779
- What's it about?
- These two guys in wheelchairs.

214
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,699
They're not much to look at.
My character is quite handsome.

215
00:21:03,949 --> 00:21:06,910
And they go to a pub
and meet these two girls.

216
00:21:07,077 --> 00:21:10,163
And they kiss them.
And the girls fall in love with them.

217
00:21:10,455 --> 00:21:13,582
- And they take them home.
- Thanks, lads. We have to go.

218
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,751
I want to hear the end of the story.

219
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:19,754
- This is the end of the story.
- I'm just getting to the good bit.

220
00:21:20,005 --> 00:21:23,466
I can't go anywhere. I'm blocked.
I can barely stand up.

221
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,926
You can't be as bad as us,
we're legless.

222
00:21:27,427 --> 00:21:30,847
Hey, do you like that?
There's more where that came from.

223
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:36,310
- You've lovely eyes.
- They're my second-best feature.

224
00:21:36,518 --> 00:21:38,520
Night.

225
00:21:58,286 --> 00:22:00,038
See ya.

226
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:06,585
What did I tell ya? Eh?

227
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:09,379
Same again?

228
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:14,050
- Oh.
- Watch where you're going.

229
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,635
You're all right, none of it went on me.

230
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:19,763
If I was in a wheelchair,
I wouldn't look for trouble?

231
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:22,181
You starting?

232
00:22:23,182 --> 00:22:25,517
His mother sucks what?

233
00:22:25,768 --> 00:22:27,227
Come here, you prick.

234
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:29,396
You bastard.

235
00:22:29,646 --> 00:22:31,814
Picking on a fella in a wheelchair?!

236
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:36,443
Fuck it.

237
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:40,905
- He's not worth it. You're right.
- That's not what your girlfriend said.

238
00:22:41,155 --> 00:22:44,742
Stop it. If he'd hit you in the mouth
you'd have nothing that works.

239
00:22:45,034 --> 00:22:48,662
I have a part or two below that might,
given the right stimulus.

240
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:51,414
He wants to know your name.

241
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:54,917
- Siobhan.
- He's Michael. I'm Trouble.

242
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:57,919
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Listen, Siobhan.

243
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,964
Could you help a poor cripple
out of a predicament?

244
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:03,216
Depends on the predicament.

245
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:06,301
I need someone to unzip my pants
and direct the hose.

246
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,137
Michael wants to go home.

247
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:13,224
- That isn't what I had in mind.
- Your mind isn't difficult to read.

248
00:23:15,392 --> 00:23:17,477
Hey. What you doing tomorrow night?

249
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:20,563
Staying out of trouble.
So should you.

250
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:24,150
Where's the fun in that?
We'd never have met you.

251
00:23:29,237 --> 00:23:31,739
Beautiful? Yes, she is.

252
00:23:32,907 --> 00:23:35,242
- Hey, girls.
- I love your dress.

253
00:23:42,331 --> 00:23:43,833
How are yous?

254
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,668
Sorry, lads.
McGuvan's, round to the right.

255
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,797
- We've come to boogie.
- Not with them boots, you're not.

256
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:53,090
Is that the club talking or is that you?

257
00:23:53,341 --> 00:23:55,676
Hey. On this door, I am the club.

258
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:03,307
Is he all right?

259
00:24:03,557 --> 00:24:08,270
He says you're in breach
of EU Directive 739, Section 6B.

260
00:24:12,773 --> 00:24:15,567
Discrimination against
persons with disability.

261
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,029
In places of public entertainment.

262
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,241
It's a 2,000 euro fine.

263
00:24:23,491 --> 00:24:26,869
Payable by the official denying entry.
That's you, pal.

264
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:29,829
How are you, Garda?

265
00:24:31,206 --> 00:24:33,666
Look, I don't want
any trouble from the law.

266
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:37,461
You just bought yourself a load.
My friend is a barrister.

267
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:45,134
Did you just make that up?

268
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:47,344
You little legal genius.

269
00:24:48,512 --> 00:24:54,350
Right. Inside. But remember for future
reference, wheelchair night's Monday.

270
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,310
Keep by the fucking wall.

271
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:22,331
Come on, Michael. Yeah!

272
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:29,713
Whoo!

273
00:25:32,381 --> 00:25:34,967
Whoo! Whoo!

274
00:25:42,515 --> 00:25:44,767
Come on, come and dance with me.

275
00:25:46,977 --> 00:25:50,021
Sure it's dancing!
What do you think I'm doing inside?

276
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,110
Whoo!

277
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,182
Look who it is.

278
00:26:49,237 --> 00:26:51,572
Come on, Michael! Yes!

279
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:09,004
Are you OK?

280
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,757
Well, piss faster.

281
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,971
Yeah.

282
00:27:21,347 --> 00:27:23,307
I was wet anyway.

283
00:27:29,938 --> 00:27:31,898
Have we got enough money for a taxi?

284
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:49,621
I'm sorry, Eileen, I told Michael
we should be getting back here,

285
00:27:49,871 --> 00:27:53,999
that you'd be worried about us,
but he insisted that we stay.

286
00:27:56,251 --> 00:27:58,795
That's what I heard, Michael.

287
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:02,798
Let's face it, you're not that easy
to understand sometimes.

288
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,217
You have to agree, Eileen.

289
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:09,721
The collection had to be abandoned
because of you.

290
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,350
And as for you, Michael...

291
00:28:15,351 --> 00:28:17,811
...I am just so disappointed in you.

292
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:21,439
You have never been any trouble before.

293
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:23,816
It was my fault, Eileen.

294
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:28,487
I led him astray,
and I've disgraced myself.

295
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:30,905
Oh, yes, you have.

296
00:28:32,448 --> 00:28:36,452
So if you just change my underpants,
we'll say no more about it.

297
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:08,562
So er... I'm going out.

298
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,194
Yeah, of course you can come.

299
00:29:17,444 --> 00:29:19,988
Do you possess a suit?

300
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:27,411
Rory O'Shea.

301
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:34,875
Hello again, Rory.

302
00:29:36,668 --> 00:29:39,754
This is Michael Connolly.
He's my lawyer.

303
00:29:41,256 --> 00:29:43,299
Oh, right.

304
00:29:43,591 --> 00:29:48,136
OK, this is your third application
for the independent living allowance.

305
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:51,556
Your previous applications
were refused on the grounds

306
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:54,683
that you were unsuited
for self-regulation

307
00:29:54,934 --> 00:29:59,145
and lacking responsibility
for the employment of others.

308
00:29:59,604 --> 00:30:02,982
Would you tell us what's changed
since your last application?

309
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:09,321
Er, well, I... I'm learning
that I have a lot of energy.

310
00:30:10,405 --> 00:30:14,783
And I'm coming to terms
with learning to control that energy

311
00:30:15,242 --> 00:30:22,123
and use it for...
constructive, productive purposes.

312
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:25,751
And I think that's progress.

313
00:30:26,001 --> 00:30:28,003
Yeah, I... I think that's progress.

314
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:33,841
Er, Rory...
you know our funds are very limited.

315
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:35,384
Yeah.

316
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:40,597
And er... we have to disperse them
in the wisest way possible.

317
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:42,807
- Mm-hm.
- OK.

318
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:47,394
Now I'm afraid that
we've heard a story

319
00:30:47,644 --> 00:30:52,690
concerning the mishandling
of some collection money.

320
00:30:56,193 --> 00:30:58,361
Rory, it's just this scheme demands

321
00:30:58,653 --> 00:31:02,573
a level of maturity and responsibility
from its candidates.

322
00:31:02,824 --> 00:31:05,993
Don't lecture me about maturity.
I'm not a fucking cheese.

323
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:10,413
We're not sure independent
living is the best choice for you.

324
00:31:10,663 --> 00:31:11,956
Choice?

325
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:16,668
Is this an application
or has a choice already been made?

326
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:22,423
Can I suggest we meet again
in six months to review the situation?

327
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:26,427
Under EU Directive 5096...

328
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:32,432
...discrimination against...
- I'm not sure I know that directive.

329
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,975
It means you have to do what I say.

330
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:37,477
Or it's a 2,000 euro fine, isn't it?

331
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,604
Isn't it?

332
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,273
It's a 15,000 euro fine.

333
00:31:52,907 --> 00:31:55,868
All I'm asking for is the chance
to live in my own home.

334
00:31:58,537 --> 00:32:01,039
- Are we agreed on six months?
- Six months!

335
00:32:02,415 --> 00:32:05,084
Six months, Rory, it's not that long.

336
00:32:07,878 --> 00:32:09,963
Some fucking lawyer you are!

337
00:32:12,423 --> 00:32:14,341
Open the door!

338
00:32:17,886 --> 00:32:20,263
Leave me alone.

339
00:32:20,513 --> 00:32:24,141
It's not OK. I have to get out of here!
I'm going to fucking die!

340
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:51,664
Lovely to see everyone here
enjoying themselves.

341
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,333
Hi, Annie.

342
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:58,211
One false move and I'm yours.

343
00:32:58,462 --> 00:33:00,630
Sing this one. Here we go.

344
00:33:26,193 --> 00:33:29,154
Have I done something
to make you unhappy here?

345
00:33:29,404 --> 00:33:31,197
No?

346
00:33:33,449 --> 00:33:35,743
Independent living isn't for everyone.

347
00:33:37,869 --> 00:33:41,289
You certainly won't get the
level of care you're used to here.

348
00:33:43,749 --> 00:33:48,587
If anything should happen to you,
God forbid, I won't be there.

349
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:52,632
I'm appealing
because I am a marked man.

350
00:33:52,882 --> 00:33:54,842
- Slow down.
- I can't. Type faster.

351
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:57,636
You've rejected my application
three times

352
00:33:57,844 --> 00:34:00,388
on the word of interfering,
dried-up bitches

353
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,891
that wouldn't know responsibility
if it bit their fat arses.

354
00:34:04,141 --> 00:34:07,936
- Do you want to rethink that phrasing?
- Yeah, it needs to be punchier.

355
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:10,188
Now type it.

356
00:34:11,397 --> 00:34:14,108
Hey, it's Judge Mumbles.
What you after?

357
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:18,111
- Michael Connolly.
- Ah, Michael, come in.

358
00:34:21,447 --> 00:34:23,407
Rory. Erm...

359
00:34:24,658 --> 00:34:27,953
If you don't mind, it's
Michael's application we're hearing.

360
00:34:28,245 --> 00:34:30,580
You'll hear it. You won't understand it.

361
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,124
Rory, can you wait outside, please?

362
00:34:33,374 --> 00:34:37,794
Between us we've enough experience
of applicants with speech difficulties

363
00:34:38,086 --> 00:34:40,255
to be able to manage without you.

364
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:42,423
Thanks, Rasheen.

365
00:34:42,673 --> 00:34:46,802
Now, Michael, the purpose of this chat

366
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:49,804
is to assess what you believe
the philosophy to be

367
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:52,181
behind independent living.

368
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:13,074
"Independent living allows me
to grow and mature as a person."

369
00:35:17,035 --> 00:35:20,121
"It helps me fulfil
the potential within myself...

370
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:28,628
...which is not always realised
by institutional living."

371
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:37,803
"It opens the way for me
to make a real contribution...

372
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,140
...and to live a fuller life."

373
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,850
Thank you, that's a very good answer.

374
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:50,313
Michael, you appreciate that
we will pay for a personal assistant,

375
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:54,191
but you need to find accommodation.
Have you found somewhere?

376
00:35:56,777 --> 00:36:02,657
OK, well, in that case, I think
we can approve your application.

377
00:36:03,658 --> 00:36:05,659
There is just one concern.

378
00:36:05,951 --> 00:36:08,286
Your decision not to use speech aids.

379
00:36:08,703 --> 00:36:11,247
Will that not make things harder
in the long run?

380
00:36:15,668 --> 00:36:17,628
"I don't need speech aids...

381
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,301
...as I will have
a full-time, live-in interpreter."

382
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,181
I'm sorry. Who?

383
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,684
"Rory O'Shea."

384
00:36:37,352 --> 00:36:39,312
Two for the price of one.

385
00:36:40,271 --> 00:36:43,065
I'm out! Can you hear me? I'm out!

386
00:36:43,316 --> 00:36:45,567
You hear that? I'm out!

387
00:36:45,818 --> 00:36:48,361
How did you come up with those answers?

388
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,909
You read their brochure?

389
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:57,994
You read their brochure back to them?

390
00:36:58,245 --> 00:37:00,205
That's genius!

391
00:37:01,372 --> 00:37:03,791
All we need to do now is get a flat.

392
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,173
How much?

393
00:37:12,423 --> 00:37:14,592
And also, the neighbours are very nice.

394
00:37:14,842 --> 00:37:17,010
- Are they quiet?
- Very quiet.

395
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,638
You're really going to like this.

396
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:23,266
Hey. Hey!

397
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:27,519
There's a bit of a problem.
Can you guess what it is?

398
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:34,316
It's a shame.
You would have loved the view.

399
00:37:34,608 --> 00:37:36,860
400 a month.

400
00:37:37,277 --> 00:37:40,447
Yeah, that's a two-bedroom flat,
city centre, yeah?

401
00:37:40,697 --> 00:37:43,032
Excellent. What's that?

402
00:37:45,201 --> 00:37:47,536
400 a week?

403
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:52,040
Right, we'll have a think about it
and get back to you.

404
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:54,291
All right, bye-bye.

405
00:38:01,923 --> 00:38:05,718
Listen, Michael, do you really
want to leave Carrigmore?

406
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:17,436
Would you be prepared
to do anything you could?

407
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:41,456
- Fergus Connolly?
- Just in there.

408
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:49,421
- Can I help you?
- Michael Connolly for Fergus Connolly.

409
00:38:49,671 --> 00:38:52,548
- Do you have an appointment?
- He does, but he's late.

410
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:55,968
- What time was it for?
- Er... 1981.

411
00:38:56,218 --> 00:38:59,929
- Traffic was murder.
- I'm sorry, Mr Connolly is not here.

412
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:05,309
Really?

413
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:08,270
- Fergus Connolly! Fergus Connolly!
- Guard.

414
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,648
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
I'm going to ask you to leave.

415
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:14,859
They're causing a disturbance.

416
00:39:15,317 --> 00:39:18,612
Fergus, it's lovely to meet you.
I'm Rory O'Shea.

417
00:39:18,862 --> 00:39:20,864
This is Michael Connolly.

418
00:39:24,366 --> 00:39:27,953
We've come to report
a blatant case of criminal neglect.

419
00:39:32,498 --> 00:39:35,459
It's all right, guard, I'll handle this.
Thanks.

420
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:37,711
Come on in.

421
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:42,632
George, I'll see you later in Nesbits.

422
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:44,842
Bye-bye. Seven o'clock.

423
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,809
It's a nice room.

424
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:02,231
- What do you want?
- Try asking him.

425
00:40:07,653 --> 00:40:09,779
Go on, he's waiting for you.

426
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:26,210
He thinks you have
nothing in your head.

427
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:30,880
Tell him.

428
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:44,892
He's shy.

429
00:40:45,184 --> 00:40:47,144
And he's proud.

430
00:40:47,352 --> 00:40:50,271
Michael didn't even
want to come here today.

431
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,773
For some reason
he thought it was demeaning

432
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,776
to seek out the gobshite
that flushed him at birth.

433
00:40:56,068 --> 00:40:58,612
I had to persuade him.

434
00:41:03,616 --> 00:41:05,618
What do you need from me?

435
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:12,123
Ground-floor flat, two bedrooms,
wheelchair access.

436
00:41:13,749 --> 00:41:15,709
Michael needs a home.

437
00:41:18,753 --> 00:41:20,713
What then?

438
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:29,888
You'll get what you had
before we came in.

439
00:41:43,357 --> 00:41:44,859
OK.

440
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:12,798
It wasn't planned
as a joyful family reunion.

441
00:42:16,427 --> 00:42:20,722
We went there to blackmail
the bastard. Mission accomplished.

442
00:42:21,014 --> 00:42:23,349
We got a home out of it.

443
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,269
Somewhere we can live.

444
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:32,231
You'd better take it,
or we're both fucked.

445
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,860
Trust me, Michael.

446
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,988
It'll be worth it.

447
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:43,949
It'll be worth it.

448
00:42:58,587 --> 00:43:00,797
Right, lads, there yous are.

449
00:43:01,047 --> 00:43:03,466
Come on in now till I show you.

450
00:43:05,676 --> 00:43:07,928
Ah. Ah, this is amazing.

451
00:43:08,178 --> 00:43:11,222
- This is amazing.
- Bedroom number one.

452
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:14,391
This one's mine! This one's mine!

453
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:16,435
Shower. The whole shebang.

454
00:43:17,894 --> 00:43:19,479
Kitchen.

455
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:21,648
Lefty.

456
00:43:21,898 --> 00:43:24,567
There you are, all mod cons for you.

457
00:43:24,775 --> 00:43:26,944
A few bits and pieces still to go in.

458
00:43:28,904 --> 00:43:30,864
And the living room.

459
00:43:31,114 --> 00:43:33,032
Lovely colours.

460
00:43:33,282 --> 00:43:37,286
Now, the lighting
can be voice activated.

461
00:43:37,536 --> 00:43:39,788
This switch here if you want to use it.

462
00:43:41,372 --> 00:43:43,082
On!

463
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:45,876
Off!

464
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:57,427
Right, well, if there's nothing else,
I'll leave the keys with you, boys.

465
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,429
Right?

466
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,931
Lefty. Lefty!

467
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,141
Is that my paper?

468
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:08,311
No rules.

469
00:44:10,855 --> 00:44:13,316
No rules, no Delilah.

470
00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:19,988
No interfering old bitches.
Just you and me in cripple heaven.

471
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:23,949
Freedom!

472
00:44:29,663 --> 00:44:34,333
So after 16 years' military service
I felt a change was required.

473
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,793
I want to do some humanitarian work.

474
00:44:37,044 --> 00:44:39,713
Could you straighten up
while I'm talking to you?

475
00:44:39,963 --> 00:44:43,132
Well now, aren't you great lads
for giving this a bash?

476
00:44:43,424 --> 00:44:45,801
Trying it on your own. Why not?

477
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:49,262
Jesus loves you, Michael.
Jesus loves you, Rory.

478
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:53,140
My work with you people
would be an expression of that love.

479
00:44:55,434 --> 00:44:57,686
Will I have to push
you two around all day?

480
00:44:57,936 --> 00:45:02,356
Spaghetti bolognese, that sort
of thing. I've a recipe for that.

481
00:45:02,607 --> 00:45:04,942
...cookies.

482
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:10,989
We'll have a great laugh.
I'm great fun to be around.

483
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:27,919
Do yous ever dress up?

484
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,089
I mean, as animals, or whatever.

485
00:45:31,339 --> 00:45:33,174
No.

486
00:45:33,424 --> 00:45:34,800
Not really.

487
00:45:36,427 --> 00:45:40,597
- We could though, if...
- No, I have a real problem with that.

488
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:46,768
Jesus, there's no way
he's working for us.

489
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:49,771
You know when something
just makes you feel sick?

490
00:45:52,857 --> 00:45:55,192
What you doing?

491
00:46:13,249 --> 00:46:16,793
Siobhan, have you not done
the Pot Noodles yet? Get a move on.

492
00:46:38,353 --> 00:46:39,646
How are you?

493
00:46:39,896 --> 00:46:42,690
No. I'm not qualified.

494
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,193
You have the best qualifications
we've seen in a long time.

495
00:46:46,443 --> 00:46:48,445
- Really?
- Definitely.

496
00:46:51,281 --> 00:46:54,492
- I already have a job.
- Yeah, you do, stacking shelves.

497
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,703
It's temporary.

498
00:47:00,997 --> 00:47:02,999
- Who would I be working for?
- Me.

499
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,835
Him. Me and him.

500
00:47:07,794 --> 00:47:09,754
Come on, we'd be no trouble.

501
00:47:10,005 --> 00:47:12,965
He can hardly talk
and I'm pretty quiet myself.

502
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,260
Oh, Jesus, I don't know.

503
00:47:16,552 --> 00:47:21,055
- I've never done anything like this.
- Excellent. Neither have we.

504
00:47:37,402 --> 00:47:39,362
We're fucking off.

505
00:47:39,821 --> 00:47:41,614
The pair of us.

506
00:47:42,031 --> 00:47:43,574
With her?

507
00:47:46,118 --> 00:47:48,453
Good man.

508
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,086
See yous.

509
00:47:59,045 --> 00:48:02,882
Hey, Delilah,
we've paid our debt to society,

510
00:48:03,174 --> 00:48:06,301
we've learned our lesson,
you won't be seeing us back.

511
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:10,472
Michael, a little something for you.

512
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:15,851
And you know that if things don't work
out for you you're always welcome here.

513
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,270
Goodbye, Michael.

514
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,147
Goodbye, Rory.

515
00:48:24,608 --> 00:48:27,361
I know we haven't always
gotten along, Eileen,

516
00:48:27,819 --> 00:48:30,864
and if I've said anything
to offend you at any time...

517
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:34,408
...then er... then good.

518
00:48:47,878 --> 00:48:50,213
It'll all end in tears.

519
00:48:50,463 --> 00:48:52,423
Bye, Michael. Bye, Rory.

520
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:30,538
- Hey, this is all right.
- Yeah. It's bigger than it looks.

521
00:49:31,581 --> 00:49:34,583
- Where'll I put this?
- Stick it in there on my bed.

522
00:49:36,085 --> 00:49:39,671
- They've delivered the telly.
- That's a big bed for a little man.

523
00:49:43,132 --> 00:49:46,552
- Raging Speed Horn?
- Yeah, stick it on and make some tea.

524
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:52,598
Oh, champagne. Fantastic.

525
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:59,688
All right. Siobhan, we'll have some
goat's cheese, some Casher Blue,

526
00:49:59,938 --> 00:50:03,065
some St Brendan brie
and some of the holy Swiss stuff.

527
00:50:03,316 --> 00:50:07,444
Is that foie gras? Excuse me,
is that...? We'll have some foie gras.

528
00:50:07,861 --> 00:50:09,988
We'll have some venison paté.

529
00:50:10,238 --> 00:50:12,490
We will have some truffles.

530
00:50:19,954 --> 00:50:22,915
There you are.
That's 415.28 euros, please.

531
00:50:26,168 --> 00:50:29,629
Yeah, definitely,
this spicy one's really good.

532
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:33,007
Michael, you should try this one.

533
00:50:35,134 --> 00:50:38,136
Who the fuck...?

534
00:50:38,386 --> 00:50:40,805
- OK, you all right?
- Just got to lift it up now.

535
00:50:41,264 --> 00:50:43,307
- Come on.
- OK. You're comfortable?

536
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:45,309
- Yeah, yeah.
- OK.

537
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:48,854
- You're doing good.
- Are you being sarcastic? Fuck you.

538
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,901
You all right?

539
00:51:58,954 --> 00:52:01,539
Oh, wait, I'll be back in a minute.

540
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:04,083
What? Siobhan.

541
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,376
OK, I've got it.

542
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:10,922
OK?

543
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:16,385
Oh! Fuck! Shit! Bollocks!

544
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,230
Yes?

545
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:36,235
Do you have a boyfriend?

546
00:52:36,527 --> 00:52:38,653
Er, I used to.

547
00:52:41,739 --> 00:52:44,325
- Did I what?
- Did you love him?

548
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:47,077
Yeah.

549
00:52:51,914 --> 00:52:53,874
Did you want to marry him?

550
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:57,002
I never really thought about it.

551
00:52:57,252 --> 00:52:59,963
Come on, now,
did he break your little heart?

552
00:53:00,213 --> 00:53:04,050
- Do you want to go under a bus?
- Do you want to go under a wheelchair?

553
00:53:04,341 --> 00:53:06,593
Yeah, shut up, Rory.

554
00:53:06,844 --> 00:53:08,804
Yeah, shut up, Rory.

555
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,850
Here, listen to this.

556
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,852
I really like this song.

557
00:53:22,982 --> 00:53:25,317
- Can I ask you something?
- Mm-hm.

558
00:53:27,736 --> 00:53:29,779
Were you born like this?

559
00:53:31,614 --> 00:53:34,992
- Like what?
- Dodgy hair and shit taste in music.

560
00:53:37,536 --> 00:53:40,914
No. No, that's something
I've had to work long and hard at.

561
00:53:57,511 --> 00:53:59,304
Will I do your hair?

562
00:55:01,481 --> 00:55:04,275
Mister. Are you a goblin?

563
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,527
No, I'm not a fucking goblin.

564
00:55:06,777 --> 00:55:08,737
- Is that an electric chair?
- Yeah.

565
00:55:09,195 --> 00:55:11,447
Bet you it's not as fast as my scooter.

566
00:55:13,282 --> 00:55:15,075
How much money have you got?

567
00:55:16,785 --> 00:55:21,080
It's important there's no cheating.
Nobody go till I say go. All right?

568
00:55:21,998 --> 00:55:25,209
Ready, steady, go.

569
00:55:34,717 --> 00:55:36,635
Get your hands in your pockets.

570
00:55:36,885 --> 00:55:37,969
Come on!

571
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:14,041
- Come on!
- Come on!

572
00:56:17,711 --> 00:56:19,421
Battery!

573
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,804
- How could you lose that?
- You should have won that.

574
00:56:30,055 --> 00:56:32,015
- You cheated.
- And we still beat you.

575
00:56:32,265 --> 00:56:35,017
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Next time, babyface.

576
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,024
- Compound.
- Compound.

577
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,526
- Go again.
- Compound.

578
00:56:47,944 --> 00:56:49,904
Hello?

579
00:56:53,449 --> 00:56:55,618
Beast.

580
00:56:58,912 --> 00:57:00,872
Siobhan.

581
00:57:03,457 --> 00:57:06,210
Am I hibernating?
Is this me till spring?

582
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,004
What is that? I'll be there in a minute.

583
00:57:09,254 --> 00:57:12,757
All right. I'll make myself a cup of tea
while I'm waiting.

584
00:57:13,007 --> 00:57:15,342
If you like.

585
00:57:21,556 --> 00:57:23,683
Rory, can you turn it down?

586
00:57:27,561 --> 00:57:29,354
We can't hear ourselves think.

587
00:57:29,604 --> 00:57:32,523
What do you have to think about?
Hey, hey, hey.

588
00:57:33,566 --> 00:57:37,527
This is my room, that's my music and
I want to listen to it. Turn it back on.

589
00:57:37,778 --> 00:57:41,447
This may be your room, but it's
his flat. We need to have some rules.

590
00:57:41,698 --> 00:57:45,868
- Rules? Fuck your rules.
- God, he's a moody bollocks, isn't he?

591
00:57:46,118 --> 00:57:50,163
- I won't have you imposing rules on me.
- What? He's the best?

592
00:57:50,455 --> 00:57:54,583
- Michael, tell her to come back here.
- I better go and sort him out.

593
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,919
Siobhan!

594
00:57:57,169 --> 00:57:59,713
- What?
- It's not your job to make rules.

595
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,131
Your job's to do what we tell you to do.

596
00:58:02,423 --> 00:58:06,552
I do the interpreting. You do the
cleaning, make the tea and cleaning up.

597
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:10,180
You are our servant, Siobhan.

598
00:58:12,181 --> 00:58:13,891
Our skiwy.

599
00:58:14,183 --> 00:58:16,143
Our slave.

600
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:18,979
Will you shut up,
or do I have to make you?

601
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:21,272
I'd like to see you try.

602
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:28,153
Just remember, you're a servant too.

603
00:58:29,738 --> 00:58:31,864
Mr Interpreter.

604
00:58:37,911 --> 00:58:40,246
OK, where were we?

605
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:47,002
Will you hold that, Michael?

606
00:59:35,751 --> 00:59:37,711
I'll be back in a minute.

607
00:59:47,886 --> 00:59:50,013
What's the matter with you?

608
00:59:55,226 --> 00:59:57,185
Did you get a hard-on?

609
00:59:57,436 --> 00:59:59,396
Come on. What did she do?

610
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:15,743
Ho! Did you see that, Michael?

611
01:00:15,993 --> 01:00:18,036
That was life passing you by.

612
01:00:18,286 --> 01:00:20,246
Come on, let's go out.

613
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:28,086
You're waiting for Siobhan? What for?

614
01:00:28,336 --> 01:00:32,173
What you going to do, sit in here
and have her do everything for you?

615
01:00:32,423 --> 01:00:34,550
Come on, let's go out.

616
01:00:39,137 --> 01:00:41,139
Fine. See you later.

617
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:44,683
You know what you're doing?

618
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,937
You're building a little Carrigmore
for yourself.

619
01:01:31,347 --> 01:01:33,266
You looking for your friend?

620
01:01:33,516 --> 01:01:35,476
He'll be back in a minute.

621
01:01:52,073 --> 01:01:54,366
- You fuck!
- Out of the car.

622
01:01:54,783 --> 01:01:58,245
- I'm a cripple.
- You'll be a cripple tonight if...

623
01:01:58,495 --> 01:02:01,497
Look, that's my chair.
Careful! It's my fucking chair!

624
01:02:06,668 --> 01:02:08,628
I'll erm...

625
01:02:10,296 --> 01:02:12,632
Who's in charge of you?

626
01:02:12,924 --> 01:02:15,217
Hey, shut...
No fucker's in charge of me!

627
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,262
Put him back in his chair.
Get this car out of here.

628
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:21,764
- Aren't you going to arrest me?
- No.

629
01:02:22,015 --> 01:02:26,185
That's discrimination. You're only
doing that because I'm disabled.

630
01:02:26,435 --> 01:02:29,396
- It's my civil right to be arrested.
- Look, just...

631
01:02:30,522 --> 01:02:33,399
Name and address.
We'll leave it at that, right?

632
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:36,652
You'll have to kick it out of me,
you bastard.

633
01:02:39,112 --> 01:02:40,613
Hey.

634
01:02:40,822 --> 01:02:42,615
What?

635
01:02:42,907 --> 01:02:46,285
Rory's a what?

636
01:02:50,747 --> 01:02:52,498
- Hi.
- Yeah?

637
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:55,334
I'm here for Rory O'Shea.
He's in a wheelchair.

638
01:02:55,584 --> 01:02:57,878
Him? We let him go
about half an hour ago.

639
01:02:58,295 --> 01:02:59,504
Oh, what?

640
01:02:59,754 --> 01:03:02,423
I offered to take him home
but he wouldn't come.

641
01:03:03,674 --> 01:03:05,884
- Did he say where he was going?
- No.

642
01:03:19,771 --> 01:03:21,606
Hey. Hey!

643
01:03:21,856 --> 01:03:24,608
You little fucking shit,
give me my hat back.

644
01:03:24,859 --> 01:03:27,527
- Come and get it.
- Give me my hat or I'll kill you.

645
01:03:27,778 --> 01:03:29,988
Come on or I'll run you over,
you little...

646
01:03:30,238 --> 01:03:33,324
- You have to catch me. Come and get it.
- Fuck! Hey!

647
01:03:33,741 --> 01:03:35,701
Come here!

648
01:03:40,246 --> 01:03:42,206
Thanks for the hat.

649
01:03:45,584 --> 01:03:48,670
This is the midnight news
from Lorne O'Brian.

650
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:53,466
Six armed nationals
were in custody tonight following...

651
01:03:53,716 --> 01:03:55,718
Do you want some more tea?

652
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,805
Rory O'Shea, in the house.

653
01:04:08,186 --> 01:04:10,480
Where were you?

654
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:13,441
Michael was worried sick about you.

655
01:04:13,691 --> 01:04:16,026
Were you worried about me, Michael?

656
01:04:17,527 --> 01:04:19,529
Escaping from jail.

657
01:04:19,821 --> 01:04:24,283
I was down to go at 11.30. I'm not
charging you, but I have my own life.

658
01:04:24,533 --> 01:04:26,452
And I haven't?

659
01:04:26,702 --> 01:04:30,163
- That's not what I meant.
- It wasn't her fault?

660
01:04:30,413 --> 01:04:33,582
Your knight in shining pyjamas
says I have to leave you alone.

661
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:39,004
Five minutes. I can either get you ready
for bed or you can slag the both of us.

662
01:04:39,421 --> 01:04:42,590
- Up to you, but...
- Come back, Delilah, all is forgiven.

663
01:04:45,009 --> 01:04:47,719
Don't you lecture me
about responsibility.

664
01:04:47,928 --> 01:04:51,514
If it wasn't for me you'd be sitting
in your own shite in Carrigmore

665
01:04:51,931 --> 01:04:53,933
spelling out "toilet" on that card.

666
01:04:54,225 --> 01:04:56,560
- Don't say that.
- Don't tell me what to do.

667
01:05:37,219 --> 01:05:39,179
I don't want your help.

668
01:05:39,471 --> 01:05:42,348
I don't want anyone's help.

669
01:08:15,643 --> 01:08:17,603
Rory.

670
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,522
What?

671
01:08:30,864 --> 01:08:32,323
No.

672
01:08:32,573 --> 01:08:35,326
She's not on our side.

673
01:08:36,452 --> 01:08:39,329
She's paid to do what we tell her to do.

674
01:08:43,541 --> 01:08:47,919
Well, I really like her.

675
01:08:50,255 --> 01:08:52,215
A lot.

676
01:08:53,966 --> 01:08:55,926
Oh, Michael, man.

677
01:08:57,052 --> 01:08:59,554
You haven't told her how you feel,
have you?

678
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:05,559
Help you?

679
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,688
Help you what?

680
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:15,192
Help you make a prick of yourself?

681
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:19,904
What have you got to offer
a woman like that?

682
01:09:21,281 --> 01:09:23,324
Cop on to yourself.

683
01:09:23,574 --> 01:09:27,577
Get a tape recorder
and fucking listen to yourself.

684
01:09:27,828 --> 01:09:31,664
Stop for a minute
and take a look at yourself in a mirror.

685
01:09:56,935 --> 01:09:59,521
You boys really need some new clothes.

686
01:10:04,191 --> 01:10:05,693
Thank you.

687
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,447
How are you, Hugh?

688
01:10:10,905 --> 01:10:12,698
Hello there.

689
01:10:16,618 --> 01:10:19,913
- Might be a bit early for this.
- Jesus, never too early, Dad.

690
01:10:20,371 --> 01:10:21,789
In you get.

691
01:10:25,584 --> 01:10:28,045
Fair play to you.
A place of your own.

692
01:10:28,295 --> 01:10:30,755
It's not really mine, Dad.

693
01:10:39,512 --> 01:10:41,764
Happy birthday, Son.
The key to the door.

694
01:10:42,015 --> 01:10:44,225
- What have I told you?
- Listen, Son...

695
01:10:44,475 --> 01:10:46,393
Dad...

696
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:50,855
Congratulations. Well done.

697
01:10:54,275 --> 01:10:58,236
It's all gone so quickly.
And I wish I could help.

698
01:11:05,576 --> 01:11:09,746
Siobhan. Hey.
You look great. How's it going?

699
01:11:09,996 --> 01:11:12,665
- Great, yeah.
- Great.

700
01:11:12,874 --> 01:11:15,959
This is Michael. Declan.

701
01:11:17,878 --> 01:11:21,089
Great. Look, I'm having a party
on Saturday night.

702
01:11:21,339 --> 01:11:23,841
It's fancy dress. You should come.

703
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:27,469
I dunno, I've...

704
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:32,181
You want to go?

705
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:35,601
Great. I got to go,
but I'll see you around nine.

706
01:11:35,851 --> 01:11:38,895
- And the doorbell's broken.
- I know.

707
01:11:41,231 --> 01:11:43,190
Oh, there's another fella.

708
01:11:43,482 --> 01:11:45,984
Bring him along. The more the merrier.

709
01:11:50,738 --> 01:11:52,698
Hey, a party.

710
01:11:54,533 --> 01:11:57,869
- Ho!
- Hello, Dr Strangelove.

711
01:11:58,286 --> 01:12:00,955
Are you sure that's what
Florence Nightingale wore?

712
01:12:01,372 --> 01:12:03,165
Who cares?

713
01:12:05,292 --> 01:12:07,628
- Ho, ho.
- Hello.

714
01:12:09,087 --> 01:12:11,422
- Doesn't he look handsome?
- He looks great.

715
01:12:26,602 --> 01:12:28,603
Be careful.

716
01:12:29,854 --> 01:12:32,773
Someone might think
tonight's their lucky night.

717
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,005
Siobhan. Great to see you.

718
01:13:00,255 --> 01:13:01,964
Michael, fair play to you.

719
01:13:02,256 --> 01:13:04,967
- This is Rory.
- How you doing? Having a good time?

720
01:13:05,175 --> 01:13:07,344
- Yeah, great party...
- Come on.

721
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:18,228
Who's the prick?

722
01:13:48,462 --> 01:13:50,422
...this is the war room.

723
01:13:50,672 --> 01:13:54,383
- That's a very good impression.
- I love Peter Sellers.

724
01:13:54,633 --> 01:13:56,552
Michael.

725
01:13:56,802 --> 01:14:01,389
He plays Chauncey Gardener
or something like that.

726
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:15,484
Come on.

727
01:14:47,552 --> 01:14:49,512
Fancy a go at the karaoke, Michael?

728
01:14:56,643 --> 01:14:58,603
What did he say?

729
01:15:00,021 --> 01:15:01,981
Of course I will.

730
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:10,030
Don't tread on my feet.

731
01:15:19,913 --> 01:15:22,248
- Who's your man?
- She looks after him.

732
01:15:53,524 --> 01:15:55,484
No, no.

733
01:15:55,776 --> 01:15:57,736
Michael.

734
01:15:59,404 --> 01:16:01,322
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

735
01:16:09,579 --> 01:16:11,539
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

736
01:17:00,663 --> 01:17:02,957
Is your phone charged?

737
01:17:03,207 --> 01:17:05,125
I'll say good night then.

738
01:17:11,047 --> 01:17:13,216
I love you.

739
01:17:13,466 --> 01:17:16,510
I'm sorry, Michael, but...

740
01:17:21,472 --> 01:17:23,974
"Do you have any feelings for me?"

741
01:17:25,684 --> 01:17:30,146
Michael, I'm paid
to do what I do for you.

742
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:35,651
That's my job.

743
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:40,905
That isn't love. And what you
feel for me, that isn't love either.

744
01:17:41,322 --> 01:17:43,532
It's gratitude.

745
01:17:47,661 --> 01:17:50,121
I like working for you, but...

746
01:17:51,414 --> 01:17:53,374
...it is just a job.

747
01:17:58,211 --> 01:18:02,757
There isn't anything else going on here,
Michael, do you understand?

748
01:18:05,092 --> 01:18:07,969
There isn't anything else going on.

749
01:18:33,532 --> 01:18:35,534
I'm not hungry.

750
01:19:05,267 --> 01:19:08,562
This is Peter. He's a qualified PA.

751
01:19:08,895 --> 01:19:12,106
He'll be looking after you
until you find someone else.

752
01:19:12,356 --> 01:19:15,317
Really? Well, he won't do.

753
01:19:15,526 --> 01:19:17,903
Michael likes them with bigger tits.

754
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:24,575
Michael, I made a mistake.
I thought I could do this, but...

755
01:19:26,869 --> 01:19:29,037
I'm leaving.

756
01:19:35,459 --> 01:19:37,586
Don't beg, it's undignified.

757
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:43,924
Parakeets don't mate with armadillos,
that's the end of it.

758
01:19:44,341 --> 01:19:47,427
- That's a filthy thing to tell him.
- Is it?

759
01:19:49,179 --> 01:19:52,348
- It's the truth.
- Oh, it's the truth you want? OK.

760
01:19:52,723 --> 01:19:55,976
To be equal you must show
the same respect you demand.

761
01:19:56,226 --> 01:20:00,063
If you insult some guy in the pub,
you expect to get hammered.

762
01:20:00,355 --> 01:20:03,608
If you come home late
you don't expect the help to be waiting.

763
01:20:03,858 --> 01:20:07,402
If a woman says no, you accept
you're not the right man for her.

764
01:20:07,653 --> 01:20:10,947
You don't have a right to love
because you're in a wheelchair.

765
01:20:11,197 --> 01:20:14,658
Siobhan. You said you were going,
I think you should go.

766
01:20:16,201 --> 01:20:20,705
- Fuck off. I mean it.
- Your disability is you're an arsehole.

767
01:20:24,542 --> 01:20:27,711
Why does everything
always have to be a fight with you?

768
01:20:30,547 --> 01:20:34,383
I can't help who I love.
I can't help who I don't love.

769
01:20:40,263 --> 01:20:42,390
It's not my fault, Michael.

770
01:20:48,061 --> 01:20:49,646
Let her go.

771
01:20:50,063 --> 01:20:52,023
Michael, let her go.

772
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:01,989
Let her go.

773
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:17,544
Where you going?

774
01:21:17,794 --> 01:21:20,296
This is your home, Michael.

775
01:21:27,969 --> 01:21:29,929
Michael.

776
01:21:36,935 --> 01:21:40,021
Are you going back to Carrigmore?

777
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:44,233
It's suicide. I don't have time
to kill myself that slowly,

778
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:48,278
so if you're going back I might as well
throw myself in this river.

779
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:56,785
You didn't fuck it up. We fucked it up.

780
01:21:57,035 --> 01:21:59,996
The pair of us. Nobody did it for us.

781
01:22:15,759 --> 01:22:17,678
I know it hurts.

782
01:22:22,015 --> 01:22:24,350
You're not the only one
with a broken heart.

783
01:22:33,566 --> 01:22:35,693
You have the future, Michael.

784
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:40,947
That's what I call a gift.

785
01:22:45,075 --> 01:22:47,035
Don't give it up.

786
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,080
You can't give it up.

787
01:22:59,921 --> 01:23:02,590
Shit, you've got the whole world
in your hands.

788
01:23:26,151 --> 01:23:28,111
You're fucking wet as well.

789
01:23:40,997 --> 01:23:44,083
Our home?
Or am I going in the fucking river?

790
01:23:56,176 --> 01:23:58,678
Yeah, it is too high.

791
01:23:58,929 --> 01:24:02,390
Take a letter, Michael.
To Dublin City Council.

792
01:24:02,682 --> 01:24:07,436
Dear sir or madam, as wheelchair users
with suicidal intentions,

793
01:24:07,686 --> 01:24:10,230
I must protest
at the lack of facilities.

794
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,983
None of the bridges are equipped
with easy parapet access.

795
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:18,028
Thus curtailing the rights
of the disabled to throw themselves in.

796
01:24:18,278 --> 01:24:22,740
Yours in disgust, Rory Gerard O'Shea
and Michael Connolly.

797
01:24:23,032 --> 01:24:25,993
Keep going, tell them.

798
01:24:33,249 --> 01:24:35,251
Do you like to study?

799
01:24:37,419 --> 01:24:40,505
Maybe you ought to
go to college some day.

800
01:24:44,091 --> 01:24:46,760
Part time or something like that.

801
01:24:49,137 --> 01:24:51,973
University? At home? That would be good.

802
01:24:54,016 --> 01:24:56,018
Me, I'd like to study medicine.

803
01:25:00,855 --> 01:25:03,399
Yap, yap, yap.

804
01:25:06,819 --> 01:25:09,821
Guys. You have a nice home here,
you know.

805
01:25:12,448 --> 01:25:15,868
But you shouldn't watch
too much TV, yeah?

806
01:25:16,118 --> 01:25:19,496
It's bad for the mind,
and bad for the eyesight.

807
01:25:19,746 --> 01:25:22,498
Why don't we go for a walk?
It's a beautiful day.

808
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:26,835
Maybe later.

809
01:25:30,171 --> 01:25:32,131
We're not keeping him, are we?

810
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:50,363
I'm just going to get some coffee.

811
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:52,448
You want one?

812
01:26:52,824 --> 01:26:55,576
OK. I'll be back soon.

813
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,712
Are you Michael?

814
01:27:10,046 --> 01:27:13,174
Your friend's very ill.
He has pneumonia.

815
01:27:13,424 --> 01:27:17,886
His heart and lung muscles
are severely affected.

816
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:23,432
Are you asking me if you can go in?

817
01:27:25,351 --> 01:27:28,603
He's very weak.
Better to let him rest this evening.

818
01:27:35,609 --> 01:27:37,611
I'm sorry, I can't understand you.

819
01:27:41,364 --> 01:27:42,949
How long?

820
01:27:45,451 --> 01:27:48,161
Probably not more than a day or two.

821
01:27:50,205 --> 01:27:52,832
It varies a little bit with Duchenne.

822
01:27:53,249 --> 01:27:55,668
But it's usually around his age.

823
01:27:58,879 --> 01:28:01,214
He'll have known that this was coming.

824
01:28:01,631 --> 01:28:04,675
He's not in any pain. He won't suffer.

825
01:28:43,332 --> 01:28:45,417
He wants to talk to you.

826
01:29:10,438 --> 01:29:12,398
There you are.

827
01:29:15,192 --> 01:29:17,861
I've been worried about you.

828
01:29:23,991 --> 01:29:26,326
Look at all this.

829
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:30,246
You see.

830
01:29:31,664 --> 01:29:34,959
Rory... O'Shea...

831
01:29:35,918 --> 01:29:37,878
...was here.

832
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:43,424
Rory O'Shea...

833
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:50,680
is... here.

834
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,280
Michael...

835
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,408
You need...

836
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:18,745
...nobody.

837
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,999
You're...

838
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:27,127
your own... man.

839
01:31:03,699 --> 01:31:06,076
Did you bring...

840
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:08,495
...my stereo?

841
01:31:16,043 --> 01:31:18,003
I never...

842
01:31:18,295 --> 01:31:20,171
...liked you.

843
01:32:32,065 --> 01:32:33,733
Hi.

844
01:32:42,073 --> 01:32:46,493
We know about Rory's condition. We
appreciate you want to help your friend.

845
01:32:46,702 --> 01:32:48,662
Is now the right time for this?

846
01:32:50,705 --> 01:32:52,832
Why did you come here today?

847
01:32:58,962 --> 01:33:00,964
"I'm his lawyer."

848
01:33:02,423 --> 01:33:05,092
Right, if you want to... erm...

849
01:33:05,342 --> 01:33:08,553
Rory's application for personal
assistance was turned down

850
01:33:08,804 --> 01:33:11,472
on the grounds of
insufficient responsibility.

851
01:33:11,723 --> 01:33:15,059
The grounds for appeal
are given as prejudice.

852
01:33:15,476 --> 01:33:20,563
Would you like to explain why Rory feels
the interviewing panel showed prejudice?

853
01:33:38,912 --> 01:33:40,872
"When I first met Rory...

854
01:33:43,249 --> 01:33:45,209
...I thought he was trouble."

855
01:33:46,043 --> 01:33:48,003
"And I was right."

856
01:33:49,254 --> 01:33:50,547
"He is trouble."

857
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:56,176
"Yet because he's seen as a rebel...

858
01:33:59,554 --> 01:34:03,974
...you believe he hasn't the
responsibility to live independently."

859
01:34:07,811 --> 01:34:10,021
"But how do you learn
to be responsible?"

860
01:34:13,608 --> 01:34:15,567
"You live in the world."

861
01:34:19,738 --> 01:34:21,698
"You make your own decisions."

862
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:25,326
"You make your own mistakes."

863
01:34:33,999 --> 01:34:37,961
"So if this panel can offer independent
living to someone like me...

864
01:34:41,798 --> 01:34:45,426
...who until recently
had no concept of what that meant...

865
01:34:57,227 --> 01:35:01,814
...and refuse someone who's very life
is an embodiment of independence...

866
01:35:08,653 --> 01:35:11,656
...then I believe
the panel showed a prejudice."

867
01:35:16,785 --> 01:35:20,788
Michael, I think we're all aware
of Rory's prognosis.

868
01:35:22,665 --> 01:35:25,918
What was your purpose
in coming here today?

869
01:35:48,937 --> 01:35:52,356
"A right must exist
independently of its exercise."

870
01:35:58,612 --> 01:36:03,658
OK. I think you can tell Rory
that in principle...

871
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:08,453
...he can have the service
he's applied for.

872
01:36:12,748 --> 01:36:14,708
Thank you.

873
01:37:04,041 --> 01:37:07,002
Do not count his deeds
against him.

874
01:37:07,211 --> 01:37:11,214
For in his heart,
he desired to do your work.

875
01:37:11,506 --> 01:37:15,426
As his fate united him
to your people on Earth,

876
01:37:15,676 --> 01:37:19,679
so may your mercy
join him with the angels in heaven.

877
01:37:19,971 --> 01:37:23,724
- We ask this through Christ, our Lord.
- Amen.

878
01:37:23,974 --> 01:37:27,769
Eternal rest grant unto Rory, oh Lord.

879
01:37:30,396 --> 01:37:32,857
- May he rest in peace.
- Amen.

880
01:37:33,107 --> 01:37:37,402
May his soul, and the souls
of all the faithful departed,

881
01:37:37,653 --> 01:37:40,655
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

882
01:38:16,018 --> 01:38:17,978
You all right?

883
01:38:19,813 --> 01:38:21,606
Can I do anything for you?

884
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,990
Thank you.

885
01:38:40,413 --> 01:38:42,373
Thank you.

886
01:39:24,617 --> 01:39:26,577
Are we going out?

887
01:39:33,958 --> 01:39:35,918
OK.
