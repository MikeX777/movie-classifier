1
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,320
Blessed be God.

2
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,720
Blessed be God.

3
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,320
Blessed be his holy name.

4
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,920
Blessed be his holy name.

5
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,320
Blessed be Jesus Christ,
true God and true man.

6
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,120
Blessed be Jesus Christ,
true God and true man.

7
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Blessed be the name of Jesus.

8
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
Blessed be the name of Jesus.

9
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
Blessed be
His most sacred Heart.

10
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,920
Blessed be
His most sacred Heart.

11
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,720
Blessed be Jesus in the most
Holy Sacrament of the altar.

12
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,520
Blessed be Jesus in the most
holy Sacrament of the altar.

13
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,720
Blessed be the great Mother
of God, Mary most holy.

14
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,520
Blessed be the great Mother
of God, Mary most holy.

15
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,520
Blessed be her holy
and immaculate conception.

16
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Blessed be her holy
and immaculate conception.

17
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,720
Blessed be
her glorious assumption.

18
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,120
Blessed be
her glorious assumption.

19
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,320
Blessed be the name of Mary,
Virgin and Mother.

20
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,120
Blessed be the name of Mary,
Virgin and Mother.

21
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Blessed be St. Joseph,
her most chaste spouse.

22
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,520
Blessed be St. Joseph,
her most chaste spouse.

23
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,920
Blessed be God in His angels
and in His saints.

24
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,520
Blessed be God in His angels
and in His saints.

25
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,720
On your feet.

26
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,320
Mr. Dunn, is that correct?

27
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,520
Yes, sir.

28
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,720
Say, "Yes, Brother Thadeus,"
Mr. Dunn.

29
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,520
Yes, Brother Thadeus.

30
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,720
You went to St. Mary's
up at Boston, correct?

31
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Yes, sir.

32
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,720
Yes, Brother Thadeus.

33
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,120
I'm glad you're amused,
Mr. Dunn.

34
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,920
It isn't often my students
find me so.

35
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,320
You served on the altar
up at St. Mary's.

36
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,920
Fine, you will continue
to do so here.

37
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,320
We still do the Latin Mass,
so brush up on your Latin.

38
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
Yes, Brother Thadeus.
Don't interrupt, Mr. Dunn.

39
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,320
Speak when directly addressed
or questioned, understood?

40
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,520
Yes, sir.

41
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,720
Yes, Brother Thadeus.

42
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,920
Now, I want you to tell me
in your own words

43
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,120
what you expect to gain

44
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,520
from your experiences
here at St. Basil's.

45
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,320
To learn?

46
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,320
I asked for a statement,
not a question, Mr. Dunn.

47
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,520
To try and do my best.

48
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,720
You must do better
than try.

49
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,520
You must succeed,
Mr. Dunn.

50
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,920
Yes, sir.

51
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,720
Yes, Brother Thadeus.

52
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,920
Right, yes, Brother Thadeus.

53
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,120
Yes what, Mr. Dunn?

54
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,520
Yes, uh...

55
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,720
I don't know,
Brother Thadeus.

56
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Yes, I will succeed,
Brother Thadeus.

57
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,520
Yes, I will succeed,
Brother Thadeus.

58
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,920
Good.

59
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,920
I wanted to talk to you
about Sister St. Luke.

60
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,720
She's been up at St. Mary's
for a long time.

61
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,920
Brother Thadeus--

62
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,120
Don't interrupt,
Mr. Dunn.

63
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,720
And don't do that thing
with your collar.

64
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,920
Sister St. Luke and I
go back a long way.

65
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,120
Do you know Sister St. Luke,
Mr. Dunn?

66
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
Yes, sir.

67
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,520
Yes, Brother Thadeus.

68
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,920
Yes, Brother Thadeus.

69
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,120
How is Sister St. Luke,
Mr. Dunn?

70
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,120
She's dead,
Brother Thadeus.

71
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,720
You may go,
Mr. Dunn.

72
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,120
Next time I see you,

73
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,320
you will be dressed
according to the school code.

74
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,720
Mr. Dunn?

75
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,920
You forgot to say thank you.

76
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,120
Thank you.

77
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,920
Brother Thadeus.

78
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Brother Thadeus.

79
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,520
Hey, you're not really going
to keep those, are you, Brother?

80
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,920
You want them back, Rooney,
you got to win them back.

81
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Well, Brother,
you got my Mickey Mantle.

82
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Do I?

83
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Oh, right, the Mick.
Thank you.

84
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,320
Excuse me,
Brother.

85
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,520
Brother Thadeus
wants to know

86
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,120
when you intend
to call the boys to order.

87
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,920
Sorry.

88
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,720
You new?

89
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,920
Yes.

90
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,520
I'm supposed to go
to this room here.

91
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,520
Right, this is on the first
floor at the end of the hall

92
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,520
on the left,
I think.

93
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,920
I don't know.

94
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,320
I'm new here too.

95
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Follow them.

96
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,920
Thanks.

97
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,320
Yesterday's assignment covered
the chapter on the Holy Trinity.

98
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,520
If you'll kindly take out
your papers, please.

99
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,320
I didn't ask anyone
to speak, Mr. Rooney,

100
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,720
but since
you're in the mood,

101
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,320
perhaps you would care
to recite from your paper.

102
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,120
The Holy Trinity
is a total mystery.

103
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,920
Therefore,
it cannot be understood.

104
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,120
Brilliant.

105
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,320
But I wanted the definition
that's in the book.

106
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,520
Oh, right, the book.

107
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,920
The Holy Trinity is, was,
and always will be total mystery

108
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,120
that can't, never could,
and never will be understood.

109
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,320
Mr. Rooney,
do you have some sort

110
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,720
of an emotional attachment
to this school?

111
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,920
No, Brother.

112
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,520
Well, then, why, in your
second year in this grade,

113
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,320
are you laying the groundwork
for a third?

114
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,520
Remain standing, please.

115
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,520
How about the new boy?

116
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,520
Mister, um...

117
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,120
Dunn.

118
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,120
Mr. Dunn.

119
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,120
Can you enlighten
Mr. Rooney?

120
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,320
No, Brother, I can't.

121
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,720
Very well, but there will be
no excuses tomorrow.

122
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
All right, Caesar.

123
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,120
Brother,
before I read my definition,

124
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,320
I'd like to preface--

125
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,720
What are you chewing?

126
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,520
It's gum, Brother.

127
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,720
Stick it on the end
of your nose, please.

128
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,320
And you will leave it there
for the remainder of the day.

129
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,120
Yes, Brother, may I--

130
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Sit down!

131
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,120
All right, Mr. Rooney,
come up here

132
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,120
and bring that piece
of paper with you.

133
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,120
Your homework seems
to have disappeared, Mister.

134
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,120
I realize that this was
a religion assignment,

135
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,320
but I hardly expected you
to perform a miracle.

136
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,520
Is that possible,
Mr. Rooney?

137
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,520
Is it possible that a miracle
has actually occurred?

138
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,720
Or is it more likely that you
were trying to deceive me?

139
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
No, Brother.

140
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,320
Well, then,
what's the explanation?

141
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,520
Well, I--

142
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
You were trying to deceive me,
weren't you?

143
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
No, Brother.

144
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,720
The truth, Mister.

145
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,920
You were trying to deceive me,
weren't you?

146
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,120
Yes, Brother.

147
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,720
And now you're sorry,
aren't you?

148
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Well, then say it.

149
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Say "I'm sorry, Brother."

150
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,120
"I'm sorry, Brother"!

151
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,720
"I'm sorry, Brother."

152
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,120
I'm sorry, Brother.

153
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,320
Eat up, Mister.

154
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,320
Welcome to St. Basil's.

155
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
You're holding up the line,
young man.

156
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,720
Can't decide?

157
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,320
Oh, I've decided
all right, Dunn.

158
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,520
I've decided I'd rather die
than eat this crap.

159
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,720
Looks kind of crowded.

160
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,320
Mind if I sit with you?

161
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Sure.

162
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,520
You'll find plenty
of seats around me.

163
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,920
Oh, yeah?
Why?

164
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,720
It has something to do
with my IQ, Dunn.

165
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,520
You see, when one is in the
presence of a superior being,

166
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,120
one naturally feels inferior.

167
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,320
Hey, Caesar,
you fat faggot,

168
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,520
you always wear gum
on your nose?

169
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,120
I take a certain pride
in the fact

170
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,320
that I've never let my
intercourse with the faculty

171
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,920
degenerate
into any physical violence.

172
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,520
Which is no mean feat
when you consider

173
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,720
the mentality around here

174
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,920
is inspired
by the Spanish Inquisition.

175
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,720
Here.

176
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,120
Thanks, Dunn.

177
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,520
And then, for insurance,
I carry a note.

178
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,720
What note?

179
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,320
It's from my uncle.

180
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,520
He's a doctor.

181
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,320
The note says I'm subject
to seizures.

182
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,720
It's a crock, of course,

183
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,120
but it keeps me from having
my character built.

184
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,320
What's up?

185
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,520
It's Williams,

186
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,320
probably got caught
playing with himself again.

187
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,520
Maybe Uncle
could write me a note.

188
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,520
I'll write you one when I get
out of Harvard Med School.

189
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,120
You mean you're not
going to be a priest?

190
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,720
Psychiatrist.

191
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,320
I wouldn't save that for later,
Dunn.

192
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,720
It might start walking.

193
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,520
This historic visit
will mark the first time

194
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,320
that the head
of the Roman Catholic Church

195
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,120
has come to the United States.

196
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,720
The Vatican further
announced today

197
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,320
that preparations are being
made for the Holy Father--

198
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,720
Holy Mother of God.

199
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
The Italians are coming.

200
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Now I know it's
the end of the world.

201
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,120
You shouldn't talk
like that.

202
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,920
That's the Pope they're
talking about there.

203
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,720
He may be the Pope,
but he's Italian to me.

204
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,120
Boo, stop playing
with my flowers.

205
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,320
I'm not playing with them.
I'm gathering them.

206
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,120
She's got to grow
out of this.

207
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,320
Don't worry.
She'll grow out of it.

208
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,520
Put the flowers back, Boo.

209
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,920
So, Michael, how's school?

210
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,120
It's all right, I guess.

211
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,720
The Brothers
know their business.

212
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,120
Do what they tell you, and
they'll turn you into a man.

213
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,720
Better, a priest.

214
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,120
Martha.

215
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,320
And won't your parents
be smiling down from Heaven

216
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,120
the day you become a priest.

217
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,920
Martha, pass the cabbage.

218
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,320
Father Dunn.

219
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,520
The cabbage, Martha.

220
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,920
Bishop Dunn.

221
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,320
Boo, tell your grandma
to pass the cabbage.

222
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,720
Pass the cabbage, Grandma.

223
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,120
Pope Michael I.

224
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,520
Come on, Boo,
off the bed.

225
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,520
I died, Michael.

226
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,320
Yeah?

227
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,520
Well, go die in your own bed.

228
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,120
I'm tired.

229
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,520
Give me the Last Rites.

230
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,320
I'm not a priest.

231
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
I'll wait till you are.

232
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,720
Well, you might wait
a lot longer than you think.

233
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,920
Where'd you get this?

234
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,720
I stole it from Grandma.

235
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,320
If she catches you smoking,
she'll have a heart attack.

236
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,720
If she hears you talking
about not being a priest,

237
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,520
she'll have a stroke.

238
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,120
Michael, study your Latin.

239
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,320
Studying, Grandma.

240
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Ready?

241
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,120
Ready.

242
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,320
Okay.

243
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Confiteor deo.

244
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,520
Confiteor deo.

245
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,720
Omnipotenti.

246
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,520
Omnipotenti.

247
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,120
Beatae Mariae.

248
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,320
Beatae Mariae.

249
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,920
Semper Virgini.

250
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,520
Semper Virgini.

251
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Beato Michaeli.

252
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,920
Beato Michaeli.

253
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Archangelo.

254
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
Archangelo.

255
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,320
Beato Joanni Baptistae.

256
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
Beato Joanni Baptistae.

257
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,920
Sanctis Apostolis.

258
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,320
Sanctis Apostolis.

259
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,520
Petro et Paulo.

260
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,720
If I looked like you,

261
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,320
I would shave my ass
and walk backwards.

262
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Janine!

263
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,920
Hey, Janine.

264
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,120
Oh, boy.

265
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,720
She's hot for me,
you know.

266
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,520
I made 30 cupcakes,
chocolate with vanilla icing.

267
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,720
Those are my
favorite--

268
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,920
Hey, Janine.

269
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,520
Hey, if you go to Loews
next Saturday night,

270
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,720
why don't you come up
to the last row balcony?

271
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,920
What for?

272
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,320
I'll show you what for
when you get there.

273
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,720
Oh, yeah,
and after that,

274
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,520
we'll have to go
to confession, right?

275
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,720
I hope so.

276
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Besides, you know
what the penance is

277
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,920
for getting felt up in Loews
last row balconies, don't you?

278
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,120
It's a rosary.

279
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,120
Shit, I could do a goddamn
rosary standing on my head.

280
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,320
You're nuts.

281
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,720
What about
my nuts?

282
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,920
This guy
is really sick.

283
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,720
It's true, Rooney.
You're really sick.

284
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,720
Hey, let me buy you a Coke
or something.

285
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,720
Oh, hot shit.

286
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,520
Hey, Saturday night, Janine,
last row balcony.

287
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Hey, look at these guys.

288
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,120
Hey, kid, come here.

289
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,120
Come here, kid.

290
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,520
I'm not going to bite you.

291
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
I wouldn't count on it.

292
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,120
Here, hold this.

293
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,520
It's the St. Mary's fairy.

294
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
Come here, kid,
I want to tell you a secret.

295
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,120
Hey, let him go, Rooney,
and I'll give you a banana, huh?

296
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,920
Hey, shut up, faggot.

297
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,720
Quit blocking the stoop, dummy.

298
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,320
Hey, why don't you go play your
games someplace else, Rooney?

299
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,720
Hey, Danni, I want you
to meet the St. Mary's fairy.

300
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Hey, what do you think?
She's cute, ain't she?

301
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,920
Let him go.

302
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,120
Hey, I think she
likes you, man.

303
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,720
I said let him go.

304
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,720
All right, Rooney,
no doggy biscuits.

305
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,520
Hey, look, kid, you keep
hanging out with that faggot,

306
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,720
you're going to start
thinking I'm pretty.

307
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,120
I told you he would
do something dumb.

308
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,920
You should have kicked him
in the balls.

309
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,520
That's what
I would have done.

310
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,720
You can sum up your experiences
with the Rooneys of this world

311
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,920
at that one moment

312
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,320
when you're gathering your books
from the floor.

313
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,920
Yeah, where's your books?

314
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,320
I carry my assignments
like this.

315
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,920
Otherwise, I'd end up
on my knees like you.

316
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,920
Don't worry
about a thing, Dunn.

317
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,720
I'll have you caught up
with your work in no time.

318
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,120
Thanks.

319
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,520
Listen, why do you let him
call you a faggot?

320
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,720
Let me tell you something
about Rooney.

321
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,720
He's just projecting his doubts
about his own sexuality.

322
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,720
It's typical.

323
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,320
Oh, Christ.

324
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,320
There's no toilet paper.

325
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,520
Hey, Williams, is that you?

326
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
Yes.

327
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,320
Do you have any toilet paper
in there?

328
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,320
No.

329
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,720
Dunn, will you check
the other stall?

330
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Yeah.

331
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Nothing.

332
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,120
Look, you better run,
or you'll be late.

333
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,920
What about you?

334
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,520
I'll work something out.

335
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,720
Would you pass up your homework
assignments, please?

336
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,320
Brother Timothy will be
observing class today.

337
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,520
Take a seat
in the back, Brother.

338
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,320
All right,
let's get started, please.

339
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,520
You're late, Caesar.

340
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,320
Yes, Brother.

341
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,920
Next time,
try running.

342
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
Yes, Brother.

343
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,720
One demerit.

344
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,920
Do you have your
homework assignment?

345
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,120
No, Brother.

346
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,320
You  didn't do your
homework assignment?

347
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,520
I did my homework assignment,
Brother.

348
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,920
I just misplaced it.

349
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,320
No homework assignment?

350
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,120
Two demerits.

351
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
Sit down.

352
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,320
Sue that janitor.

353
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,720
By nowyou should all have
a copy of David Copperfield.

354
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,320
Anyone who doesn't,
speak now--

355
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,320
You'll pay for that,
Caesar.

356
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,720
But, Brother,
my screws are gone.

357
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,920
Bring your desk up here, Mister.

358
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,720
Where are your screws, Caesar?

359
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,320
I have no idea,
Brother.

360
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,320
All right, who did it?

361
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,520
Who took the screws?

362
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,520
On your knees, all of you.

363
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,720
And you will remain
on your knees

364
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,120
until the joker
comes forward.

365
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,320
I tried to warn you.

366
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,120
You, Mr. Dunn.

367
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,520
Stand up, please.

368
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,120
Perhaps you would care to share
your comments to Mr. Caesar

369
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,320
with the rest of the class.

370
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,120
I said I was sorry
I didn't tell him

371
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,920
that he didn't have any screws,
Brother.

372
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,720
Come up here, Mr. Dunn.

373
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,720
Did you take Caesar's screws,
Mr. Dunn?

374
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,120
No, Brother.

375
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,720
Do you know who did?

376
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,920
No, Brother.

377
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,320
Mr. Dunn, there's something
you should know about me.

378
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,120
I'm not a man
who enjoys violence.

379
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,920
In fact, I find
I get much better results

380
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,720
when I use patience.

381
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,120
And this, Mr. Dunn,
is patience.

382
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,920
Now, I think you know
who took Caesar's screws

383
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,320
and to who you would
have to answer.

384
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,720
It's "to whom,"
Brother.

385
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,920
What?

386
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
It's "to whom,"
Brother,

387
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,920
as in "to whom he would
have to answer."

388
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,120
Now, do you know to whom
you will have to answer

389
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,920
for interrupting?

390
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,320
To you, Brother.

391
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,720
Right again.

392
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,120
Hands and knees, Mr. Caesar,
up and down the aisle.

393
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,320
Let's hear it,
Mr. Caesar.

394
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,920
To whom, Brother.

395
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,320
To whom, Brother.

396
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
Mr. Dunn,
who took the screws?

397
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,520
I don't know, Brother.

398
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:08,120
Brother, maybe I should
come back some other time.

399
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
Oh, no, please stay.

400
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
I'm about to show you

401
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,320
how patience
triumphs over impudence.

402
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,520
To whom, Brother.

403
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,520
Hold out your hands,
please, Mr. Dunn.

404
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
To whom,
Brother.

405
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,120
To whom, Brother.

406
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,920
Who took the screws?

407
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,520
Who took the screws?

408
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,920
Point him out,
Mr. Dunn.

409
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,320
All right, that's enough.

410
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,920
Well, Brother, is there anything
else you'd like to show me?

411
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,720
Paper says it may rain
this afternoon, Mr. Rooney.

412
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,720
Do you think Brother Paul
will call off track and field?

413
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,520
I don't know, Brother.

414
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,920
Thadeus.

415
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,720
If he doesn't,
we'll be missed out there.

416
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,520
Come in.

417
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,520
You wanted to see me, Brother?

418
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,320
Yes, let's step outside.

419
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,120
Get off the wall, Mr. Dunn.

420
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,320
Keep an eye on those boys,
Brother.

421
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Dunn, how you doing?

422
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,320
Hey, look, man,
I really appreciate

423
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,720
the way you held out
for me like that.

424
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,320
I never expected you
to take so much.

425
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,120
Man, all I remember was
that look on Constance's face

426
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,320
when you jumped me.

427
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,720
That goddamn faggot,
Constance.

428
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,920
He never expected you
to do something like that.

429
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,120
Oh, man, my goddamn arms
are killing me.

430
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,720
How about you?

431
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,120
Fuck this, man.

432
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,320
I'm putting my arms down
for a while.

433
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,520
Hey, so listen, Dunn.

434
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,920
After all this,
you won't have to hang out

435
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,920
with that faggot, Caesar,
anymore.

436
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,120
I mean, you can hang out
with the regular guys.

437
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,120
You know what I mean?

438
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,320
Drop dead.

439
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,520
I thought I was going to learn
something about running a class.

440
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,520
But instead, I was offered
a demonstration in brutality.

441
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,720
The man seemed to be
enjoying himself, Brother.

442
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,320
That's a rather
slanderous thought, Brother,

443
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,920
one that really ought
to be kept to oneself.

444
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,120
Brother Constance
is an effective teacher,

445
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,320
one of the best we have.

446
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,720
I hear you,
Brother, but, uh--

447
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,120
But what?

448
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,920
We all come to the order
full of ideas.

449
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,720
But after a while,
we often find

450
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,920
that we have much
to learn ourselves.

451
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,720
In any event, authority
must never be undermined

452
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,520
by displays of dissention
among the faculty.

453
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,120
For the students' sake,
you understand.

454
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,920
No, I don't understand.

455
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,520
Then you should try to restrain
yourself until you do.

456
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,320
Hey, Dunn,
where you going?

457
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,720
I'm going home.

458
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,320
Hey, why don't you hang out
for a while?

459
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,520
Get lost, huh?

460
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,720
Hey, look, Dunn.

461
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,320
You jumped me
in front of everybody.

462
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,120
You made me look
pretty stupid.

463
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,320
I got to save face.

464
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,920
If I don't make you
my friend,

465
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,520
that means I got to kick
your ass every time I see you.

466
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,320
Now, nobody wants that
to happen, right?

467
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,120
So what do you say, huh?

468
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,520
Let's give it a try.

469
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,320
Come on.

470
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,920
You know, Dunn,
I always liked you.

471
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,320
Hey, Danni,
getting any lately?

472
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,520
Danni,
come here a minute.

473
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,520
Williams has something
for you.

474
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,320
I got something
for him.

475
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,920
How's it hanging, Williams?

476
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,720
Hey, Rooney,
how's it going?

477
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,720
Hey, over here, Dunn.

478
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:10,320
I've got a sweeter song
than the birds in the trees.

479
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,120
Well, I guess you'd say.

480
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,320
Hey, Danni.

481
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,120
Hey, where's your old man?

482
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,720
How come I haven't
seen him lately?

483
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
You want
something?

484
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,520
Yeah, I want you, babe.

485
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,320
Order something
or get lost, okay?

486
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,920
All right,
get me a pack of Luckies

487
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,920
and a Coke
for my new friend here.

488
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,120
My treat.

489
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,920
Hey, Dunn, do not waste
your time with her.

490
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,320
She's just 100% frustrated

491
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,320
from spending all her time
with her old man.

492
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,920
I mean, she never made it
with nobody.

493
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,920
Not even me,
if you can believe that.

494
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
Don't choke on them.

495
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,120
Yeah, yeah,
hey, listen, Danni.

496
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,720
We're going to be starting the
school dances in a couple weeks.

497
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,720
How would you
like to go with me?

498
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,720
Nope.

499
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,520
Not even if I get
my father's new car

500
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,920
and we went driving afterwards?

501
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,120
You don't even have
a license, Rooney.

502
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,120
So what's a license
got to do with it?

503
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,920
I can drive.

504
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,120
Hey, Danni, it's got electric
leather seats and windows.

505
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,520
What are you trying to do,
make me hysterical?

506
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,520
50¢.

507
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,720
Thanks a lot, Dunn.

508
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,320
Thanks.

509
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,520
So how about it,
Danni, huh?

510
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,720
Electric leather seats.

511
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,520
I don't want to go
to no Catholic dance.

512
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,920
I ain't a Catholic.

513
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,120
And even if I was, I wouldn't go
with a jerk like you

514
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
even if you were bishop.

515
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:55,120
See, what did I tell you?
100% frustrated.

516
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,920
Rooney, my sick friend,
got a cigarette for me?

517
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,320
Hey, Janine.

518
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,120
How would you like
to go riding around with me

519
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,320
in my father's new car?

520
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,120
It depends on who's
doing the driving.

521
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,120
It's got electric leather seats
and windows, Janine.

522
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Leather?

523
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,520
Electric.

524
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,320
Hi.

525
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,520
Can I t a pack
of Chesterfields, please?

526
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,320
Yeah.

527
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,720
Got a light?

528
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,120
And Rooney--

529
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,120
Rooney, never gamble with what
you don't want to lose.

530
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,720
Hey, that's deep,
Brother.

531
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Yeah, well, I'm deep.

532
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,120
It's a raid!

533
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
Hey, where are you going?

534
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,120
That's my house
through there.

535
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,920
Nobody goes
through my house.

536
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,120
Shit.

537
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,120
No, no, no, no, no.

538
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,320
You got me, Brother.

539
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,520
So what school
do you go to?

540
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,720
Aw, Christ.

541
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,320
Look at this.

542
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,520
If they'd just
leave us alone.

543
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,520
Listen, why don't you
just leave, okay?

544
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,520
Heads up.

545
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
I haven't been to school
this year yet.

546
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,120
I thought
they'd come after me.

547
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,320
But all they do
is send letters.

548
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,520
I don't think
they care that much.

549
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Besides, I can learn
more than they can teach me

550
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
just from reading
on my own.

551
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
Maybe I'll go back someday.

552
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,920
Maybe.

553
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,520
Okay.

554
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,920
You ain't like
those other jerks, are you?

555
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,320
I don't know.
I just got here.

556
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,120
Gentlemen, it pains me
to tell you this.

557
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,720
But of all the Basil boys
I've had in this room,

558
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,320
this is by far
the most physically unfit.

559
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:08,920
Therefore, in keeping with the
late great President Kennedy's

560
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,520
nationwide physical fitness
program,

561
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,920
I have decided that,
starting today,

562
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,720
we'll put away
the things of our childhood

563
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,120
and begin the work of men.

564
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,720
The day is coming, gentlemen,
when you will be called upon

565
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,520
to defend this country
against the communists.

566
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,920
And when that--

567
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,320
And when that day comes,

568
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,720
you'd better be in better shape
than you are right now.

569
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,120
The communists
are fierce fighters,

570
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,520
fanatically dedicated
to their cause.

571
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,120
And do you know
what this cause is?

572
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,720
No, Brother.

573
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,120
Killing Catholics.

574
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,720
Hey, Caesar,
you have something up your nose?

575
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,720
Not anymore, Brother.

576
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,720
Well, how would you like
something up there

577
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,320
that you can't blow out?

578
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,920
Not really, Brother.

579
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,920
All right, men,
after swim class,

580
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,320
we will all assemble
in the gym

581
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,920
for a period
of severe calisthenics.

582
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,520
We'll put Constance
in the hospital

583
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,120
with this assignment,
Dunn.

584
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,120
He'll be asking religion,

585
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,320
and we'll be answering
metaphysics.

586
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,320
What are you doing?

587
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,720
Sorry.

588
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,720
You want me to look up
something here or what?

589
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,320
Oh, go ahead
with what you're doing.

590
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,720
Do you know that daydreaming
relieves the unconscious?

591
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,720
It's a common activity
among geniuses.

592
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,320
Really?

593
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,520
Really.

594
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,120
It's also common among
schizophrenics and fools.

595
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,720
Speaking of fools,
what are you doing here?

596
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,720
Shut up, fathead.

597
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,920
I'm here to see Dunn.

598
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,520
What's the matter?

599
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,120
Thadeus took me off
track and field.

600
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,120
Why?

601
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,920
He heard me call Constance
a goddamn faggot

602
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,720
when we were kneeling
in his office.

603
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,320
I don't know how he did it,
but he heard me.

604
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,120
He's omniscient.

605
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,520
Yeah, his mother's
probably one too.

606
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,720
Anyway, he says I'm off
track and field

607
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,720
until I go apologize
to Constance.

608
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,720
So go apologize.

609
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,120
Oh, sure,
go tell Constance

610
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,120
I'm sorry I called him
a goddamn faggot.

611
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,920
He'll cream my face.

612
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,320
But without track and field,

613
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,120
my grades will be based
on my grades.

614
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,720
That means I'm going to be
in this goddamn school

615
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,120
for the rest of my goddamn life.

616
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,720
Sshh!

617
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,720
So what are you
going to do?

618
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,520
I'm going to study.

619
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,520
You think that's funny?

620
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,520
Caesar, why don't you
work with him?

621
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,320
Caesar doesn't work
with morons.

622
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,920
No, hey, Dunn, forget it.
I don't need any help.

623
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,720
Especially from a faggot
like him.

624
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,520
Why don't you just work
with each other?

625
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,120
No!

626
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,120
Hey, Caesar.

627
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,920
Don't say nothing, man.

628
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,120
I don't want nobody
to know I'm here.

629
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,720
They might get
the wrong idea.

630
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,520
Hey, listen,
I think Dunn's right.

631
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,920
I think you should help me.

632
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,520
Hey, I'm not saying we have
to be friends or anything,

633
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,120
strictly business,
no strings attached.

634
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,720
Hey, maybe I could do something
for you too, anything.

635
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,520
I just can't afford
to get let back anymore.

636
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,120
I already got hair on my balls,
Caesar.

637
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,320
So what do you say, huh?

638
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,120
You going to help me or what?

639
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,320
Come on, please.

640
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,120
Hey, you can still be a faggot
as far as I'm concerned.

641
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,320
Please, Caesar, huh?

642
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,120
Corby, you can't tell him
you lied to your father.

643
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,120
He'll make you go back
and apologize to him.

644
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,920
Then he'll break
your goddamn legs.

645
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,520
Tell him it was a bus driver
you lied to,

646
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,920
you know, someone you're
never going to see again.

647
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
Right.

648
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,520
And what's this, huh?

649
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,920
You stole 22 times?

650
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,720
What the fuck are you,
a goddamn Jesse James?

651
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
And what did you steal?

652
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,120
He's going to want to know.

653
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,320
And he's going to tell you
to bring it all back.

654
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,920
Here, change this 22 to 2

655
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,520
and tell him it was
some food or something.

656
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,720
What if he wants me
to bring that back?

657
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,720
What, the crap?

658
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,320
And add three lies
to the others,

659
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,120
but don't tell him
it's him you were lying to.

660
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,120
You know,
like you forgot who it was,

661
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,320
then you're home free.

662
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,720
Yeah, but that still leaves me
with one lie.

663
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,720
Yeah, but it's
a beautiful trade-off.

664
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

665
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,920
It's been three months
since my last confession.

666
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,720
Go on.

667
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,920
I've lied three times.

668
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,920
I've been angry very often.

669
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,120
I've shown disrespect
to my elders several times.

670
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,720
Hey, Williams,
you got your list?

671
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,920
Yeah.

672
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,120
Let's take a look.

673
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,720
Jesus, you got here
you jerked off 168 times

674
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,520
and it's been one month
since your last confession.

675
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,120
That's an average of--

676
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,120
5.6 times a day.

677
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,720
Oh, my God.

678
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,920
You can't tell him that.

679
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,720
He'll cut your balls off.

680
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,920
Here, make this
three jerk offs.

681
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,120
Divide the rest into
impure thoughts and wet dreams.

682
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,720
And add another lie
to your list.

683
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,920
Check.

684
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,520
What kind of magazine?

685
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,120
Uh, one with pictures in it.

686
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,320
What kind of pictures?

687
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:34,120
Pictures of things,
uh, women, Father.

688
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,520
And what did you
think about

689
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,920
when you looked
at these pictures?

690
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,520
Think about?

691
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,720
Did you have
any thoughts?

692
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,920
Yes, Father.

693
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,320
What kind of thoughts?

694
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,520
Impure thoughts, Father.
I was coming to that sin.

695
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,720
When you had
these impure thoughts,

696
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,320
did you commit
impure acts?

697
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,920
Yes, Father, I was coming
to that sin also.

698
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,120
How often did you commit
these impure acts?

699
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,320
Oh, just once.

700
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,720
Just once?

701
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,520
You sure about that?

702
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,120
I want you to think
for a moment.

703
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,720
Yes, just once, Father.

704
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,520
When you committed
these impure acts,

705
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,320
did you do it alone
or with someone else?

706
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,520
Oh, no, alone,
always alone.

707
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,320
Always?

708
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,720
What happened
to just once?

709
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
Oh, I mean just once alone.

710
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,720
What's he going to confess?
Taking a shit?

711
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,920
What is taking so long?

712
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,120
Perrin's in there.

713
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
Perrin
the Pervert?

714
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,520
Yeah, and Father Abruzzi.

715
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,120
Perrin the Pervert
and Impure Acts Abruzzi.

716
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,120
God, we're going to
be here all day.

717
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,720
I want you to throw
that magazine away.

718
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,120
I want you to give the money
back to your parents.

719
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,120
Oh, no, I can't.

720
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,920
You're going to have to.

721
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,120
For your penance,
say 6 Our Fathers

722
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,920
and 12 Hail Marys,

723
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,920
and I want you to say Rosary
every day for a week.

724
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,120
Can you remember all that?

725
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,320
Yes.

726
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,720
Make an act
of contrition.

727
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,720
Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry
for having offended Thee,

728
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,920
and I detest all my sins

729
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,320
because I dread the loss
of Heaven and the pains of Hell

730
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,520
but most of all because
they offend Thee, my God,

731
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,520
who are all good and deserving
of all my love.

732
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,920
What?

733
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,120
What!?

734
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,520
You little weasel.

735
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,320
I was only joking.

736
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,120
Come on, Father,
can't you take a joke?

737
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:38,920
Hey, I got an idea.

738
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,320
Keep an eye out
for Father Abruzzi.

739
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,120
Yeah.

740
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,320
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

741
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,120
It's been six weeks
since my last confession.

742
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,120
Go on, my son.

743
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,920
Father, I'd like to confess a
sin I thought I could live with.

744
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,320
But it's becoming a problem.

745
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,920
An impure act?

746
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,320
Something much worse.

747
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,720
Really?

748
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,720
Father, I entered
and, typically, won

749
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,120
an inter-borough
essay contest.

750
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,520
I accepted a nominal
cash prize,

751
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,720
and the article was published
in the community paper.

752
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,120
Big deal, my son.

753
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,320
Father, I failed to footnote
some of my sources.

754
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,720
Get to the sin,
please.

755
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,520
Plagiarism, Father.

756
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,320
Alone or with someone else?

757
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,920
With a girl?

758
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,320
I did it myself.

759
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,320
Yeah, so?

760
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,720
Father,
if this is discovered,

761
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,120
it could someday keep me
out of Harvard.

762
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,920
And, Father, I was conceived
to go to Harvard.

763
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,720
All right, all right,
you are forgiven.

764
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,920
Do you have any other
good stuff,

765
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,120
impure thoughts,
desires, fantasies?

766
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,520
No, Father.

767
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,520
What?

768
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,120
What kind of a faggot
are you, anyway?

769
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,720
Dominus vobiscum,
shithead.

770
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,120
You're going to recite
one Our Father, one Hail Mary,

771
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,120
and you're going to help
your buddy, Ed Rooney,

772
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,520
get passing grades, or you can
kiss off Harvard, pal.

773
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,520
There is no God.

774
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,720
Hey, I'm telling you guys:

775
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,720
Fast dancing's
for faggots, man.

776
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,720
Girls fast dance
with their sisters.

777
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,720
I mean, think about it
for a second.

778
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,320
Her body, her soft, perfumed,
and powdered body

779
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,320
leaning against yours.

780
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,920
Her legs, her thighs,
moving against yours.

781
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,520
Her delicate,
perfectly formed knobs.

782
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,720
Oh, Jesus.

783
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,520
Hey, and it's
all legal.

784
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,320
It is?

785
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,320
Yeah.

786
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,520
All right!

787
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,320
My name is Brother Timothy,
and I have been sentenced

788
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,120
to preside over this series
of dances.

789
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,120
First of all,
I'd like to welcome

790
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:09,120
the Virgin Martyr girls
and thank them for coming.

791
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,720
And I have a note to remind you

792
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,120
that there will be
a First Friday novena

793
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,320
this coming Friday.

794
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:30,320
And now let me introduce
to you Father Abruzzi,

795
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,920
who will be giving
the first talk.

796
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,920
Thanks.

797
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,920
Father.

798
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,720
Wait just a second,
Father.

799
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,720
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

800
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,320
As you know,
these dances are designed

801
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,720
to help you learn
to interact with one another

802
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,520
in a way befitting
young men and women

803
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,520
of a strong moral fiber.

804
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,120
You're all at an age now

805
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,920
when you're perhaps
beginning to notice

806
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,720
the difference
between the boys and the girls.

807
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,720
And just as she is

808
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,720
at every other important moment
of your life,

809
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,320
the Church
is here to guide you.

810
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,320
Many of you will be
experiencing certain feelings,

811
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:40,320
feelings which you might be
inclined to confuse with love.

812
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:44,920
But ladies and gentlemen,
never confuse love

813
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,720
with the deadliest
of the seven deadly sins.

814
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,120
Lust, ladies and gentlemen,

815
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:04,520
has undone and cast down
into the infernal fires of Hell

816
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,320
even the most advanced souls.

817
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:16,120
There is a beast living within
each and every one of you,

818
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:21,920
a filthy beast,
whose name is--

819
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,720
Lust.

820
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,720
That's right,
ladies and gentlemen.

821
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,920
Lust is the beast within you,

822
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,120
the beast that wants
to consume you

823
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,920
and then spit you out
into the eternal fires of Hell,

824
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,720
where, for all eternity,

825
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,120
your flesh will be ripped from
your body by grotesque serpents

826
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,720
with razor-sharp teeth,

827
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,720
where, for all eternity,
your blood will boil,

828
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,720
your bones will burn,

829
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,120
and your marrow
will be reduced

830
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,120
to a putrid black slime!

831
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,120
And for what?

832
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,720
For a few moments
of weakness

833
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:10,520
that led you to admire the shape
of somebody's buttocks.

834
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,720
Any questions?

835
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,520
Very well, then.

836
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,720
Have a nice time.
Enjoy the dance.

837
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,520
And I'll see you all next week.

838
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:51,320
I did you wrong.

839
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,120
My heart went out to play.

840
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:59,920
But in the game,
I lost you.

841
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,520
What a price to pay.

842
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,120
I'm crying.

843
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,720
So how come you guys
aren't dancing?

844
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,920
Caesar doesn't dance.

845
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,920
Oh.

846
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,920
Guys want anything?

847
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,120
Me? No thanks.

848
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,720
Caesar hardly walks.

849
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,120
What's your excuse?

850
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,120
I don't know,
waiting for inspiration.

851
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:34,920
Inspiration?

852
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,320
Who from, the Holy Ghost?

853
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,120
Come on, it's a cinch.

854
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,920
You just walk up
to some girl you like,

855
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,120
you look her
in the eye,

856
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,120
say, "Excuse me,
but you want to dance?"

857
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,120
Works every time.

858
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,320
Yeah.

859
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,320
What if it doesn't?

860
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,920
Well, if it doesn't work,

861
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:54,320
then you got to start thinking
about joining a religious order.

862
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,920
Maybe I'll see you later.

863
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,520
Maybe you better
start dancing.

864
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:08,120
I'm just about
at the end of my rope.

865
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,920
But I can't stop trying.

866
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,520
I can't give up hope.

867
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,720
I'm dying.

868
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,920
Baby, baby.

869
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,720
Eight fingers,
there, Rooney.

870
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,720
Eight fingers.

871
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,120
Can you still get
your father's car, Rooney?

872
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,720
Sure, let's go.

873
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,320
No, wait, not now.
After the dance.

874
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,520
And I don't want
to go alone.

875
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,520
You're not going alone.

876
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,120
You're going with me.

877
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,920
I mean, we have to take Cathleen
with us.

878
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,720
What the hell for?

879
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,720
Because we came
together.

880
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,120
All right,
I'll get Corby.

881
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,320
That slime?

882
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,120
All right, I got it.
I'll take Williams.

883
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,920
You're right.

884
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,720
Who then?
Give me a name.

885
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,720
Who?

886
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,920
Over there.

887
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:25,720
Who, him?

888
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,320
What, is she weird
or something?

889
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,920
I think she likes his brains.

890
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,720
Hello?

891
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,720
Hello?

892
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,720
Hello?

893
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,120
Danni?

894
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,720
Excuse me.
I was looking for Danni.

895
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,520
What the hell
are you doing here?

896
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,120
The door was open.
I was looking for you.

897
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,520
I guess I shouldn't have
just come on in, huh?

898
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,720
Damn straight you shouldn't
have just come in.

899
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,720
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to talk.

900
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,920
Get out of here, okay?

901
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,520
Sorry.

902
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,320
I just wanted to dance
with you.

903
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,320
You're still here?

904
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,520
Yeah, I guess I am.

905
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,520
You want to come in?

906
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,320
Nah, I'm going
to head home.

907
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,720
Come on.

908
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,720
Please?

909
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,320
Okay.

910
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,920
Listen, I didn't mean
to yell at you like that.

911
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,320
And I'm sorry, okay?

912
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,520
Sure, don't worry
about it.

913
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:00,720
I just don't like nobody
going back there.

914
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,120
He's not always
like that.

915
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,320
My father,
he's not always like that.

916
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,920
It's just melancholia.

917
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,320
What?

918
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,120
You know,
he's down in the dumps.

919
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,720
How come?

920
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,920
'Cause the woman
he loved

921
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,520
and loved him back

922
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,720
killed herself.

923
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,120
Your mother?

924
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,320
No, not her.

925
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,520
She's the reason
the woman killed herself.

926
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,520
You see, even though my father
loved this other woman,

927
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:43,320
he couldn't bring himself
to leave my mother.

928
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,320
Stupid.

929
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,720
Anyway, that's when my father
got melancholia.

930
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,120
And that got my mother
pretty mad,

931
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,120
'cause she knew why
he had melancholia,

932
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,920
so she left him.

933
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,320
How's that for a kick
in the head?

934
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,720
God.

935
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,720
Yeah, God.

936
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:13,520
What's the matter?
You smoke or what?

937
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,920
What are you smoking
my cigarettes for?

938
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,520
Sorry.

939
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,920
Caesar.

940
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,920
What do you think
you're doing, Rooney?

941
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,720
Tonight's the night,
buddy.

942
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,520
Tonight's the night
for what?

943
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,320
Hey, listen, uh,

944
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,320
Janine said she'd go
riding around with me

945
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,320
in my father's new car.

946
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,920
Tell her I can recommend
a good therapist.

947
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,120
Excuse me.

948
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:03,120
Well, listen, Cathleen
wants to go with you.

949
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,120
Forget it, Rooney.

950
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:09,120
Harvard, Caesar.
Harvard.

951
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:12,320
Look, Rooney, I'll help you
with your grades.

952
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,920
But do you think holding
that over my head

953
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,920
puts me at your beck and call
for life?

954
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,120
Yeah.

955
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,920
Thank you, God.

956
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,920
Are you sure this is okay?

957
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,920
Yeah, my father's in Chicago.

958
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,920
Pile in.

959
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,720
Get the fuck
in there.

960
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,520
Where's Janine
and Rooney?

961
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,520
What do you think
they're doing?

962
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,520
I don't even want
to think about it.

963
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,120
Where's Cathleen
and Caesar?

964
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,920
Oh, don't worry
about those faggots.

965
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,120
They can take care
of themselves.

966
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,920
Here, take some more.

967
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,320
Hey, take a little more.

968
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,320
More?

969
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,520
Yeah.

970
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,520
It relaxes you.

971
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,520
Okay.

972
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:57,520
Bye.

973
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,920
You know, Janine.

974
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,720
I've waited a long time
for this.

975
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,520
I know you waited
a long time too.

976
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,120
I know you want it.

977
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,720
You won't regret this,
Janine.

978
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,320
I swear you won't.

979
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,720
Oh, God.

980
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,520
Oh, God.

981
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:32,120
I really enjoyed that article
you had published in the paper.

982
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,920
Which one?

983
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,120
The one they gave you
the prize for.

984
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,720
Did you?

985
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,720
Yes, I thought it was
well-written, entertaining,

986
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,120
and extremely
enlightening.

987
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,320
Did you really?

988
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,320
Yes, and I especially liked

989
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:53,520
the way you detailed the split
between Freud and Jung.

990
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:59,320
I did do that rather well,
didn't I?

991
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:04,120
Well, you see,
Freud was sort of an asshole.

992
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,920
Well, I mean,
to reduce everything

993
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,720
that is longer than it is wide
to a penis is--

994
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,320
What's that?

995
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,320
It's a goddamn boat.

996
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,720
What the fuck
do you think it is?

997
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,320
What's that?

998
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,920
Don't you know anything?

999
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,120
It's a goddamn bridge
answering a goddamn boat.

1000
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,720
Why would the bridge
be answering the boat?

1001
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,320
So that the goddamn boat
knows that the goddamn bridge

1002
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:41,120
knows that the goddamn boat
knows that the bridge

1003
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,120
knows the boat
is coming through.

1004
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,120
Goddamn!

1005
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,720
Fuck, my car.

1006
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,920
Caesar,
open the fucking door.

1007
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,920
There's a fucking
boat coming.

1008
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,320
I ain't playing around.

1009
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,120
Open the fucking door,
Janine.

1010
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,120
I'm going to be sick.

1011
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,720
I don't care.
Open the fucking door.

1012
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,320
What's wrong?

1013
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,520
Rooney, what's wrong?

1014
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,120
Rooney, what's wrong?

1015
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,920
What's going on?

1016
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,520
Get the fuck off me.

1017
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,920
Come on, let's get out of here.

1018
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,920
I can't find my goddamn keys.

1019
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,920
Damn.

1020
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,520
Precious and warm a memory

1021
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:13,120
through the years.

1022
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:16,720
Oh, thank you, God.
Thank you.

1023
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,320
I'll never forget you for this,
God.

1024
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,520
Oh, my God.

1025
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,720
God, what are you doing?

1026
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,520
You're fucking me up here, God.

1027
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:48,520
Through the years.

1028
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:56,120
And I still can see
blue velvet...

1029
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:02,320
through my tears.

1030
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,920
Blue velvet.

1031
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,720
Fuckin' A, man.

1032
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:24,920
Janine.

1033
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,720
Leave her alone,
Rooney.

1034
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,720
Yeah, yeah,
hey, listen.

1035
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,720
What happened
to you?

1036
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,320
My father just got back
from Chicago.

1037
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,320
Hey, listen,
I just found out,

1038
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,720
if you get the Pope to wave
at you when you're together,

1039
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,520
that means you can have sex
without sin.

1040
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,720
Your ass.

1041
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,120
No, really, because then
you're as good as married

1042
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,120
in the eyes of the church.

1043
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,120
I mean, why do you think
all those Italian guys

1044
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,920
always cheer every time
he waves at them.

1045
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:46,920
Up yours, Rooney.

1046
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,920
And get your stupid face
away from me.

1047
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,320
Hey, see you later,
Janine.

1048
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,120
What are we going to do,
sit here all day?

1049
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:09,920
You kidding?

1050
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,520
This is Thadeus' idea
of a good time.

1051
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,320
Yeah, well, the Thad
wouldn't know a good time

1052
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,320
if it slid up his leg
and bit him on the patoingas.

1053
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,920
Where's Rooney?

1054
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,920
I don't know,
Brother.

1055
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,320
Where's Dunn?

1056
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,520
Don't worry.

1057
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,120
Those faggots are never
going to know we're missing.

1058
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,520
What did they do to Elvis,
cut his balls off or something?

1059
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:58,320
Now that we are one.

1060
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,920
Miserable.

1061
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,120
Are you familiar
with the word miserable?

1062
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:06,720
Well, you will be,

1063
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,720
because miserable
is what I am going to make

1064
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,320
your miserable lives
every miserable minute

1065
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,920
of every miserable day

1066
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,120
from now until Easter.

1067
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,920
Am I making myself
understood?

1068
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,120
Yes, Brother.

1069
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,120
Yes, Brother what?

1070
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,720
Yes, Brother, miserable,
Brother.

1071
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,920
What does that faggot Constance
have us using these things for?

1072
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,320
Because he is a sick man.

1073
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:36,520
He is sick if he thinks I'm
going to do this every Sunday.

1074
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,520
I got better things to do
on my Sundays.

1075
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,320
Yeah, like taking a drive
in the Gowanus Canal.

1076
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,920
Man, it looks like every bird
in Brooklyn took a dump on him.

1077
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,520
Of all the places
there are to drop turds,

1078
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,320
I wonder why they all
pick on the Bas'.

1079
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,920
Think about it,
all right?

1080
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,120
But work while you
thk about it.

1081
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,920
There's the pitch.

1082
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,520
You know,
I can't figure out

1083
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,120
how a guy like you
ever became a Brother.

1084
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,320
What do you mean,
a guy like me?

1085
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:52,320
Take a look around.

1086
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,520
There's all kinds
of different guys here.

1087
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,520
What's wrong with me?

1088
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,520
I don't know.

1089
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,720
I just can't figure it out
is all.

1090
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,520
Well, a lot of people
can't figure it out.

1091
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,120
My brother was supposed to be
the one with the vocation.

1092
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,720
Me, they had me written off
as the bum.

1093
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,920
But here I am,
wearing a robe,

1094
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,120
bouncing a ball
on the steps of the rectory.

1095
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,920
Is your brother a bum?

1096
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,520
Sort of.

1097
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,720
He sells life insurance
down in Maryland.

1098
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,120
Come on.

1099
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,320
Yeah, everybody's got it
all figured out for me too.

1100
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,520
Ever since I was a kid,

1101
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,720
they've been telling me
I'm going to be a priest.

1102
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,320
If my grandmother has her way,
I'll be Pope.

1103
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:35,520
Just be sure to remember
all us little guys down here

1104
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,720
when you're up there
in the Vatican.

1105
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,720
So you're a working girl,
too, eh?

1106
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,120
Isn't that nice, now?

1107
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:58,720
Isn't that nice,
hmm?

1108
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,920
Pass the potatoes.

1109
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:17,320
Michael's going to be a priest.

1110
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,720
Great.

1111
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,720
Your grandparents
seem like nice people.

1112
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,720
Yeah, my grandma's not used
to having kids around,

1113
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,920
so it's weird for her.

1114
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,920
She's all right.

1115
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,720
You're going to be
a priest, huh?

1116
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,320
Why, you want my blessing?

1117
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,520
Sure.

1118
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,520
There's my bus.

1119
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,320
Yeah.

1120
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,520
Uh, listen, you still want
to dance with me?

1121
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,320
Sure.

1122
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,520
Okay, someday,
when the weather breaks,

1123
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,520
I'll take you down to the beach,
to the Bop House.

1124
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,120
Great, I don't dance
too good.

1125
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,720
I'll teach you how to dance,
Father Michael.

1126
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,320
Aw, fuck.

1127
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,320
Dunn, this is the greatest day
of my life.

1128
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,120
Hey, Willie.

1129
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,720
Give me some change?

1130
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,520
How's it going?

1131
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:44,920
Ah, spring has sprung.

1132
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,720
Got a good summer coming too.
Good summer coming.

1133
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,720
Hey, how about you?

1134
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:52,720
You being good?

1135
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:53,720
Trying.

1136
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,720
You better.

1137
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,520
Friend of yours?

1138
01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,520
Yeah.

1139
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:04,120
Kind of dead
around here now.

1140
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:07,520
In a couple weeks,
it'll be jumping

1141
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,520
with every party-head
in Brooklyn.

1142
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,520
That's okay.

1143
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,120
I'm not too crazy
about crowds.

1144
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:16,520
Yeah, but on summer nights,
with the lights and stuff,

1145
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:19,720
people dancing, it's like
a whole other planet,

1146
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:23,920
whole other weird,
fantastic planet.

1147
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:31,920
I've been loving you

1148
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:38,320
too long

1149
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:42,120
to stop now.

1150
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:52,520
You are tired.

1151
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:57,720
You want to be free.

1152
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:01,920
My love is growing stronger.

1153
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:07,320
as you become a habit to me.

1154
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:12,920
Ooh, I've been loving you

1155
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:17,920
a little too long.

1156
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,720
I don't wanna stop now.

1157
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:31,720
With you, my life

1158
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:39,320
has been so wonderful.

1159
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,120
I can't stop now.

1160
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,920
You know, lots of times,
when you're with somebody,

1161
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,920
you feel like you've always
got to talk to them,

1162
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,920
you know, I mean,
always be saying something,

1163
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,920
or it starts
getting embarrassing.

1164
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:52,920
You know?

1165
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:57,720
I don't feel that way
with you, though.

1166
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:01,720
I feel like I don't have
to talk, and it's all right.

1167
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,920
You know what I mean?

1168
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,720
Yeah.

1169
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,520
Yeah?

1170
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,120
Got something for you.

1171
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,920
What?

1172
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,120
Special rock.

1173
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:16,520
What's so special
about it?

1174
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:19,120
What's special
about it is,

1175
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,120
if you have a wish
you want to come true,

1176
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,920
you take that rock
and throw it as far as you can

1177
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,720
into the ocean,
and it will come true.

1178
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,720
Really?

1179
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,720
I don't know.

1180
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,920
That's great.

1181
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,120
Michael.

1182
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,320
Got something for you.

1183
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,120
It's a hubcap,
'56 Chevy.

1184
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,320
Keep it.

1185
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,320
Beauty.

1186
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,120
Yep.

1187
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,120
Let's get in.

1188
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,720
It's getting wet.

1189
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:01,720
Come on.

1190
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:04,920
I don't want to stop now.

1191
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:16,120
Don't make me stop now.

1192
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:19,120
Oh, baby.

1193
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,720
I'm down on my knees.

1194
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:26,920
Please,
don't make me stop now.

1195
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,320
I love you.

1196
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,520
I love you.

1197
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,920
I love you
with all of my heart.

1198
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:37,720
And I can't stop now.

1199
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:42,320
Please, please, please,

1200
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,920
don't make me stop now,

1201
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,520
good God almighty.

1202
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,320
My heart and soul,
I love you.

1203
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,920
I love you.
I love you.

1204
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:52,720
I love you.

1205
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,920
Good God Almighty,
I love you.

1206
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,720
Hi, Boo.

1207
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,520
Did you see Grandma?

1208
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,120
She waited up for you.

1209
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,520
Yeah, I saw her.

1210
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:31,920
She's going to set herself
on fire one of these days.

1211
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,520
Where were you?

1212
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,120
Out.

1213
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,920
Out with that girl?

1214
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,720
Yeah.

1215
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:42,120
Do you like her?

1216
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,320
Yeah.

1217
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,320
Do you love her?

1218
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,320
None of your business.

1219
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,920
Come on, get out of here.
I'm tired.

1220
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,720
It's not my fault
you're tired.

1221
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:56,120
You're tired because you were
out all night with that girl.

1222
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,720
And you were out
all night with her

1223
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,920
because you do love her.

1224
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:02,920
And you're all wet.

1225
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,120
Michael, you're not
going to leave me, are you?

1226
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:07,720
Of course not.

1227
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,120
What are you
talking about?

1228
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,720
You're going to go away
with that girl

1229
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,920
and leave me here
with Grandma and Grandpa.

1230
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,520
Are you going to leave me,
Michael?

1231
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,720
No.

1232
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:25,920
I'm not going to leave you.

1233
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,720
"In that high place
in the darkness,

1234
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:40,320
"the two oddly sensitive
human atoms

1235
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,120
"held each other tightly
and waited.

1236
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:47,120
"The mind of each
was the same thought.

1237
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,920
"'I've come
to this lonely place,

1238
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,920
and here's this other.'"

1239
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:58,320
I like the part about the two
oddly sensitive human atoms.

1240
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,720
You want me to stop?

1241
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:19,720
Hey,
all right.

1242
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,120
Got it.

1243
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,920
I cannot work
in this madhouse anymore.

1244
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,920
And your book report doesn't
sound like David Copperfield.

1245
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,320
Hey, you know,

1246
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,920
I think something's going on
with those two over there.

1247
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,120
Never mind that.

1248
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,520
Let me ask you a question.

1249
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,920
Why do you keep referring
to W.C. Fields?

1250
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:56,320
Because he was in it.

1251
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,120
In what?

1252
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,120
In the goddamn movie, stupid.

1253
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,520
You got a couple
of smokes?

1254
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,920
Why me, Lord?

1255
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,720
Hey, look,
it's not my fault

1256
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,520
you don't know
who W.C. Field is, all right?

1257
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,320
Hey, get your own, huh?

1258
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,520
Look, I know who
W.C. Fields is.

1259
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,520
Who'd he play in the movie?

1260
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,120
Hold on.
Let me check my notes.

1261
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:19,920
See, here he is.

1262
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,720
He's the guy
with the hat.

1263
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:22,920
Only they fucked up,

1264
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,920
because he don't look
like W.C. Fields at all.

1265
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,920
Too skinny.

1266
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,920
I'll write you a one-
and two-syllable version

1267
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:31,720
of my own report.

1268
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:34,920
You can sign your name
on it later.

1269
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,120
Yeah, but that's cheating.

1270
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,520
The shitheads are coming!

1271
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,320
They're taking names!

1272
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,520
Oh, Margaret.

1273
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,520
You're creating a famine down
at the other end of the table.

1274
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,320
I don't know who's responsible
for this girl.

1275
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,320
But I think the social
welfare people

1276
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,720
will find this a very
interesting situation.

1277
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,520
She is a juvenile
delinquent.

1278
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:42,320
She should be arrested and that
whole place closed down.

1279
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,120
Don't you think
that's a little extreme?

1280
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,120
Oh, I forgot.

1281
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:49,120
Brother Timothy's
favorite hangout.

1282
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,120
We have a responsibility
to take some action here.

1283
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,920
That girl's undermining
everything we try to do.

1284
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:56,720
If I were the headmaster--

1285
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:57,920
If you were headmaster,

1286
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,920
you'd probably call out
the National Guard.

1287
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,520
But at the moment,
I'm headmaster.

1288
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:02,520
And at the moment,

1289
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,920
the headmaster is trying
to enjoy his dinner.

1290
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,120
Where has all the bread gone?

1291
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,520
Ask Brother Dominic
where the bread went.

1292
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,920
Brother Dominic.

1293
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,120
Where has all the bread gone?

1294
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:19,120
Oh, would you be kind enough
to pass this down

1295
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,720
to Brother Thadeus,
with my compliments.

1296
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,520
He buttered it too.

1297
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:40,720
I've noticed a marked
improvement in most of the work.

1298
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:44,120
And in some cases,
a miraculous recovery.

1299
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,320
Yahoo.

1300
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:47,320
Yahoo, Mr. Rooney?

1301
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,920
Certainly your grades indicate
that you have the ability

1302
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,520
to succeed if you'll just
apply yourself.

1303
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:53,720
But let's save the yahoos

1304
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:56,120
until we see how well you do
in your other subjects.

1305
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,320
A minus, Brother?

1306
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,320
I found your assertion
that Charles Dickens

1307
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:08,920
was a paranoid schizophrenic
slightly hard to swallow.

1308
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:13,320
Not to mention
irrelevant.

1309
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,520
A minus.

1310
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,720
What is this school
coming to?

1311
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,320
Hey, look, if you need some help
on your next paper,

1312
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,920
hey, what are friends for?

1313
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,320
Hey, Dunn,
where you going?

1314
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,920
Okay, step aside here.

1315
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,720
We're all set.

1316
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,520
We'll make arrangements
with your mother

1317
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:39,520
to have the inventory
accounted for.

1318
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,520
They made this happen,
didn't they?

1319
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:00,120
Nobody made this happen.

1320
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:13,120
I just don't want you
to be sad.

1321
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:17,120
Because I'm not.

1322
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,320
Promise?

1323
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,320
No.

1324
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:31,520
We have to go.

1325
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,320
Hey, listen, um, I'm glad
I got to dance with you.

1326
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:41,320
Don't worry, Dunn.
We'll find her.

1327
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,520
I can't believe
you talked me into this.

1328
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,920
First thing in the morning,
I'm having my head examined.

1329
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:02,720
Hey, shut up.

1330
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,720
We're doing it for Dunn.

1331
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:04,720
In the morning,

1332
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,120
you're going to be glad
you did it.

1333
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,920
You're going to feel
like a man.

1334
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,720
God, who has given you

1335
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:17,720
the opportunity
for eternal life,

1336
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:21,520
has given you this life
on Earth, this finite life,

1337
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,120
this life
with a beginning and an end

1338
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:27,920
that is measured out
in increments of time.

1339
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:30,920
Time.

1340
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:34,920
Time is a medium of exchange.

1341
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,720
You can use it.

1342
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,720
You can purchase things
with it.

1343
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:42,720
So don't waste your time
when you're out of school.

1344
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:46,320
Whether it be the Easter recess
or the summer vacation,

1345
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:51,720
make it a point
to spend your time fruitfully.

1346
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:53,720
Hey, he's talking to you,
get it?

1347
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:56,520
Fruitfully?

1348
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:59,920
Time will give back to you
tenfold

1349
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:00,920
what you've given to it.

1350
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:03,120
It will make better men
out of you.

1351
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,320
It's time
to cheer up Dunn.

1352
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,320
Don't take that out now,
Rooney.

1353
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:07,320
Shut up.

1354
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,720
Dunn, I got a little present
here for you,

1355
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:13,320
just a little something to put
the smile back on your face.

1356
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,120
You think now that
you know everything.

1357
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:18,320
But what is ahead for you
is extraordinary.

1358
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:27,320
And remember, whether you are
in school or out of school,

1359
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,320
you are representatives...

1360
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,720
Of St. Basil's.

1361
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:38,120
You and you and you

1362
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,720
and you and you.

1363
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:40,920
Let's go.

1364
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:46,320
And you are charged with
upholding the moral character--

1365
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,520
Let's go.

1366
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,720
identified with this school.

1367
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:08,720
That's far enough.

1368
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:10,520
Against the wall, please,
gentlemen.

1369
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,320
You, too, Rooney.

1370
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,120
Make yourselves comfortable,
gentlemen.

1371
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,120
Is he gone?

1372
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:52,520
I think that faggot
figured out who did it.

1373
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,120
Oh, what gives you
that idea?

1374
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:56,120
What are you
going to tell him?

1375
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:57,120
Oh, let's see.

1376
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,520
You're sitting
in the assembly

1377
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,120
with a saint's head
in your lap.

1378
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:02,120
Tell him you found it
in a box of Cracker Jacks.

1379
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:03,320
No, that's no good.

1380
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:05,520
We've got to think of something
better than that.

1381
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,520
Hey, Williams,
what are you doing?

1382
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:08,920
Corby, shut up.

1383
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:11,520
Williams is playing
with himself in here.

1384
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,320
All right, I got it, listen.

1385
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,320
This is what we'll tell him
when he comes back.

1386
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:17,120
We'll tell him--

1387
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,520
we'll tell him
we don't know

1388
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,120
what the fuck
he's talking about.

1389
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:21,520
How is he going to argue
with that?

1390
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,520
Come on, Caesar.
We're going to get killed.

1391
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,520
I've got a note.

1392
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,120
Well, sure,
listen to him.

1393
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:27,120
He's got a goddamn note.

1394
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,320
What about
the rest of us, huh?

1395
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:31,120
We're all in this together,
you know.

1396
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,520
Hey, Dunn,
where are you?

1397
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,520
Right here.

1398
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,320
Hey, Dunn, we did it for you,
you know.

1399
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,720
Yeah, I appreciate that.

1400
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:41,520
I will appeal to him
as one human being to another.

1401
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:42,920
I'll reason with him.

1402
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:46,920
Oh, sure, you're going to reason
with a grown man in a dress?

1403
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,920
Come with me, please.

1404
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,120
That's far enough.

1405
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,720
Thank you, Brother.

1406
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:26,920
Gentlemen, we will dispense

1407
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:29,320
with the traditional
accusation-denial ritual.

1408
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,720
It's such a bore

1409
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:32,920
and not likely to convince me

1410
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,720
that I don't have before me,
right now,

1411
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:37,920
at least one, if not all,
of the vandals.

1412
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:39,320
But,
since I'm a just man

1413
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:41,120
with no taste
for punishing the innocent,

1414
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:44,720
I will afford the guilty
the opportunity to speak now

1415
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,920
and to save the innocent

1416
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:49,720
from an impending
state of wretchedness.

1417
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,720
Well?

1418
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:56,920
Could you repeat that,
Brother?

1419
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:03,120
Shut up.

1420
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,720
All right,
who did it?

1421
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,720
Speak now, or you will
all suffer for it.

1422
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:19,320
I did.

1423
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:30,120
Mr. Dunn.

1424
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:31,520
He didn't
do it.

1425
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:37,520
Williams
did it.

1426
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:40,920
What do you mean,
I did it?

1427
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:43,520
Corbet did it.

1428
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,720
No, it was Caesar's idea
to take the head off.

1429
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:47,920
All right.

1430
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,520
All right,
that's enough!

1431
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:57,920
Have it your own way,
gentlemen.

1432
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,520
Mr. Corbet, you will approach
the horse, please.

1433
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:18,120
Gentlemen, will you
turn around, please?

1434
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:34,920
Mr. Williams.

1435
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:55,520
Mr. Caesar.

1436
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:05,120
Brother, I'm exempt
from this sort of discipline.

1437
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,120
The famous note.

1438
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,120
I see you've had it
laminated.

1439
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,520
To protect it.

1440
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,720
Very good, I'll return it to you
when we finish.

1441
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:23,320
Please, Brother,

1442
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:28,320
can't we work out
another punitive plan, please?

1443
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,920
Please, Brother, please.
This is barbaric.

1444
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:33,520
Who are you calling barbaric?

1445
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,120
You leave him alone.

1446
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:58,120
Shit.

1447
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:00,920
Holy shit.

1448
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:02,920
Come on,
Caesar.

1449
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:09,920
Never let it be said

1450
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:15,120
that one of our boys performed
less than admirably

1451
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:17,120
on any occasion

1452
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:18,920
or displayed anything less

1453
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:22,920
than the most noble character
in so doing.

1454
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:39,720
Let's go.

1455
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:44,120
I said let's go.

1456
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:45,520
What is this?

1457
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,520
It's quite all right, Brother.
Everything's under control.

1458
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:51,520
Bastard!

1459
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,120
This impudent

1460
01:36:58,120 --> 01:36:59,120
piece of--

1461
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:22,720
They should be expelled.

1462
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,720
In the real world,
they'd be charged with assault.

1463
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:28,520
In the real world, they'd have
a case for self-defense.

1464
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:31,120
I think expulsion
is justified here.

1465
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,720
No one cares
what you think.

1466
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:35,520
Fetch the boys in here.

1467
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,720
Those kids
are our responsibility.

1468
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:41,520
No one need remind me of
our responsibilities, Brother.

1469
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:11,520
Can you gentlemen
give me a good reason

1470
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,120
why you shouldn't
be expelled?

1471
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:16,720
It's my fault, Brother.

1472
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:19,320
I'm the one
who should be expelled.

1473
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:22,120
You all acted as one,
Mr. Dunn.

1474
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:24,720
And as one, you shall bear
the consequences.

1475
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,520
Yes, Brother,
but I started it.

1476
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:27,720
Did you?

1477
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:32,120
As I understand it,
Brother Constance started it.

1478
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:34,120
What?

1479
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:37,320
I'm suspending you
for two weeks.

1480
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:39,520
Good day, gentlemen.

1481
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,920
What do you mean,
I started it?

1482
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,120
They assaulted
the faculty.

1483
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:00,920
They have disgraced
this institution.

1484
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:03,720
And they destroyed
a statue of St. Basil.

1485
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:07,320
I always hated that statue.

1486
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:08,920
What is this?

1487
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:11,520
I'm having you transferred
out of the school.

1488
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:14,520
I don't want you working
with children anymore.

1489
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,720
You can't do this.

1490
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:18,520
I will demand an investigation.

1491
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:19,520
I'll take this

1492
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:20,720
all the way to the bishop
if I have to.

1493
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:24,920
Take it wherever you want,
Brother.

1494
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:28,120
Just take it
out of my office.

1495
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:44,120
It appears we have a vacancy,
Brother.

1496
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:47,320
You think you can fit in?

1497
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:50,520
I think so, Brother.

1498
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:55,920
I can't tell my father
I'm suspended.

1499
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:57,720
I'll have to leave the house
every morning

1500
01:39:57,720 --> 01:39:59,120
and pretend
I'm going to school.

1501
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:02,320
Yeah, so what else
is new?

1502
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,920
I'll never,
ever get into Harvard now.

1503
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,120
I'll have to settle
for Queens College.

1504
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:14,920
Well, you should feel right
at home at Queens  College.

1505
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,320
Guess this means
I can't be Pope.

1506
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:24,720
Not unless you have three
miracles to your credit.

1507
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,720
I can't believe we're not going
to be in this place

1508
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:31,720
for two weeks.

1509
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:36,920
Yeah!

1510
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:39,320
And it's one for the money,
two for the show--

1511
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:43,320
In 1966, everybody graduated
from St. Basil's.

1512
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,520
Except me.

1513
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:47,920
Caesar went on to graduate
with honors from Queens College

1514
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:49,920
and became a podometrist

1515
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:52,920
or a psychiatrist
or some fag job like that.

1516
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:55,720
Williams got a job
as a projectionist

1517
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:58,720
at the Peek-a-Boob Theater
in Times Square.

1518
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,920
Corbet married Janine.

1519
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:03,320
Imagine, a turd like him.

1520
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:04,920
They have six kids.

1521
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,120
I heard Dunn and Danni
ran into each other at Woodstock

1522
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:10,120
at Max What-His-Face's farm,

1523
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:12,920
where 1/2 million faggots
stood in the rain

1524
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:15,320
for three days
with no clothes on.

1525
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:18,120
Me, I went to beautician school,

1526
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:20,520
where everybody graduated
except me,

1527
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:23,120
but I got a job
as a shampoo boy

1528
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:25,320
at Maricia's House of Hair
in Bensonhurst.

1529
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:28,520
The hours suck,
the pay sucks,

1530
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,920
I'm surrounded by funny guys,

1531
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:32,720
but the tips are great.

1532
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:35,120
Thank you, God.

1535
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:44,920
Well, you can do anything.

1536
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:47,720
But lay
off my blue suede shoes.

1537
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,520
Rock it!

1538
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:05,520
Well, it's one
for the money,

1539
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:06,920
two for the show,

1540
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,120
three to get ready.

1541
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,520
Now go, go, go.

1542
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:14,520
But don't you
step on my blue suede shoes.

1543
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:15,320
Well, you can do anything.

1544
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:18,120
But lay off
of my blue suede shoes.

1545
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:20,120
Let's go, cats.

1546
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,120
You can burn my house,

1547
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:37,120
steal my car,

1548
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:40,320
drink my liquor
from an old fruit jar.

1549
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:42,720
Do anything
that you want to do,

1550
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:45,320
but uh-uh, honey,
lay off of my shoes.

1551
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:49,720
Don't you
step on my blue suede shoes.

1552
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:51,520
You can do anything,

1553
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,720
but lay off
of my blue suede shoes.

1554
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:56,120
Rock it.
