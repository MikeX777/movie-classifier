1
00:01:23,494 --> 00:01:26,426
Funny kid. She's on the right path.

2
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:34,065
And don't go daydreaming
when I need your eyes.

3
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:38,786
We can never be quiet in this house.

4
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:42,339
-Stop! It's a private property!
-But we're guests at the house.

5
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,047
-Stop goddamnit!
-Let us go.

6
00:01:45,292 --> 00:01:47,336
I'm telling you to stop!

7
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:49,931
-What?
-Who are they?

8
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:52,510
-How could I know?
-Probably Laurent's friends.

9
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:54,861
-He has strange friends.
-I don't care.

10
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,304
We can never be quiet in this house.

11
00:01:57,414 --> 00:01:59,747
-Stop goddamnit!
-Stop the car.

12
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:04,704
We're sorry. We didn't hear you.

13
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,914
We're coming to see Laurent.
Laurent Lorrain. It's here?

14
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,753
Yes it's here.

15
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,208
We're Laurent's friends.

16
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:17,261
From the Art school.

17
00:02:18,045 --> 00:02:19,457
The fine arts...

18
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:21,556
The fine arts...

19
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:25,663
Why not? Laurent seems to
be very fond of them.

20
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:30,730
I've got nothing against that. It's a high-class 
fad inherited from his mother.

21
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:35,195
Look at Elsa and you'll
have an idea of her painting.

22
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:39,424
Superb and academic even if she
never went to the fine arts.

23
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:45,619
I mean academic but transfigured by
something that no school can learn.

24
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:47,995
A strenght, a passion!

25
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,293
The only paintings I've seen from
Laurent were Ingres pastiches.

26
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:56,465
My God! Ingres...I'm exagerating.

27
00:02:56,683 --> 00:03:00,711
I don't know where that languor comes from.

28
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,253
You're exagerating. There's one
thing or two not so bad in Laurent's work.

29
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,810
Remember that big thing
with china ink

30
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,718
that the Parturier's hung above their
sideboard. -Evidently. Three accents...

31
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:15,384
a black wash and suddenly we have
the sea tortured by the wind spirit.

32
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,887
And I don't mention his ironworks.
Or art metalwork as he says.

33
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,201
The truth is that he loses himself.

34
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:28,159
Don't worry. This is Laurent in a nutshell.

35
00:03:28,906 --> 00:03:30,966
Family dinners you know.

36
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:33,373
And after all it's only...

37
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:36,251
nine o'clock.

38
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:43,213
Please don't reproach me
again about Milos' slipshod shirt.

39
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:48,772
Or I will tell you again that I don't
want anyone to go through my jewels.

40
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:50,358
Walerian!

41
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:56,811
I already told you to stop nosing in Elsa's jewels. 
You know very well how she hates that.

42
00:04:00,984 --> 00:04:01,930
John...

43
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:06,419
To the chapel.

44
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,611
You don't take off your clothes?

45
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:45,729
What's the matter with you?

46
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,368
How can you say that?

47
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:50,849
What I like with you is your worriness.

48
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:53,797
I should worry about what?

49
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:55,625
It's what I say.

50
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:58,103
You never see anything.

51
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:00,269
You're self-satisfied.

52
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:03,138
You're at ease here like...

53
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:06,233
you were at your aunt's
in Villers-Cotteret.

54
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:10,516
And in ten minutes you will
snooze like a locomotive.

55
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:14,040
And Laurent? You don't find
his absence a bit odd?

56
00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:17,351
He wrote you.
He invited you here, didn't he?

57
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:19,757
Nobody said he wasn't here.

58
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:23,620
-He's probably in Aix.
-In Aix? It's nonsense.

59
00:05:24,476 --> 00:05:26,876
Did you get a good
look at them at least?

60
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:31,329
You're incredible. He's still
his son and her brother.

61
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:36,058
I was wrong to take you to that
Terence Fisher retrospective!

62
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:39,730
You're an hopeless romantic...

63
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,676
a dark romantic girl.

64
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:45,345
Which makes it worse for you.

65
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,341
Turn off the light.

66
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,926
It's a strange room.

67
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,931
I'll never be able to sleep.

68
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,863
Ungrateful high-class girl!

69
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:21,887
You're lodged in a modern art
museum and you still complain.

70
00:06:22,646 --> 00:06:23,711
Smart guy.

71
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,043
If you cough tomorrow
don't count on me...

72
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,432
What now?

73
00:06:36,732 --> 00:06:38,117
What's happening?

74
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:01,844
Helene?

75
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,999
What's happening?

76
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:22,637
It's ridiculous.

77
00:07:23,832 --> 00:07:24,875
Come back.

78
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:27,273
Helene.

79
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:29,905
Leave me alone!

80
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:32,303
Oh shit!

81
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:24,641
What have you done with that lovely girlfriend of yours?

82
00:10:24,743 --> 00:10:28,545
She's not feeling very well this morning.
She wants to sleep a bit longer.

83
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:31,879
Or maybe it's our oil cooking that
didn't sit well with her?

84
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,705
We're leaving.

85
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:39,804
-Already?
-We must be at Antibes before 3 PM.

86
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,647
You're not going to leave without
seeing Laurent first?

87
00:10:43,537 --> 00:10:45,388
You like my sister?

88
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:49,106
Sadic, sadic! It's you
the sadic of the garrigue.

89
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:51,921
Take the girl with you and
bring back some tea.

90
00:10:51,964 --> 00:10:54,764
You're a nice boy. It must
put you in a bad spot sometimes.

91
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:58,876
I already told you a hundred times
not to leave the newspaper within her sight.

92
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:01,719
She already has bad role models with us.

93
00:11:03,892 --> 00:11:06,648
Oh la la, that boring sadic of
the year story again!

94
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,157
And those endless articles written by Benedetti. The 
poor guy must drown himself in his own words.

95
00:11:14,317 --> 00:11:18,050
It's still funnier than the
sum-up of the church celebration.

96
00:11:18,838 --> 00:11:21,652
You can't go like this?
What would Laurent think of you?

97
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,209
Daddy, tell them to stay.

98
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:27,878
Laureeeennt!
-I'm coming.

99
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:31,071
Hey Laurent!

100
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,045
You were here? I was taking my time.

101
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:36,742
I didn't mean to make you wait.

102
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:38,572
You're all alone?

103
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,962
Helene is here, isn't she? Where is
she? You're hiding her from me.

104
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,082
Helene, Helene?
-In the chapel.

105
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:47,415
His mad dog number.

106
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:51,528
Sit down and have some tea. So our oil 
cooking does not agree with you?

107
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:57,492
-You're going to Aix this morning?
-I will be back for lunch.

108
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:01,180
You can give an envelope to Milos?

109
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:06,764
Be reassured, it's precisely to disengage him. 
I had completely forgotten our party tonight.

110
00:12:07,536 --> 00:12:11,210
Even if all things considered Milos
won't look so odd amongst our guests.

111
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,943
Your friend Bezin will
probably bring his whore.

112
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:17,466
-Bring the envelope to the office.
-Again!

113
00:12:17,597 --> 00:12:21,541
I already spent my life bringing your messages to 
the gas station. I prefer leaving the message there

114
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:25,617
while getting some gas. Between you and
your friends my tank is always full.

115
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,780
My dear father, he has to be
taken like he is.

116
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:34,089
I tease him, he fiddles with me but in the end we 
always agree. Drink your tea, it's going to be cold.

117
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,403
You knew this spot? No you didn't.
Nobody knows it fortunately.

118
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:45,943
Sun and loneliness. They will soon
become very rare in this damn country.

119
00:12:47,138 --> 00:12:49,405
You know I was raised
here almost entirely.

120
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:52,592
When I was a child running
with shepherds in the garrigue.

121
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:55,077
My tomboy side.

122
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:59,269
Even now I often roll
myself in the thyme fields.

123
00:13:01,107 --> 00:13:03,046
You don't believe me, do you?

124
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:05,831
It's my Garbo side deceiving you.

125
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:09,331
I'm a simple and healthy girl.

126
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,821
I think we could understand
very well each other.

127
00:13:14,696 --> 00:13:18,254
So...I was talking about my
healthy and sportive side.

128
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:21,083
You're a sportsman too, aren't you?

129
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:25,035
Wait a minute, let me guess.

130
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:26,857
Football?

131
00:13:27,747 --> 00:13:29,074
Basketball?

132
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,296
Swimming maybe?

133
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:35,416
Nothing. I used to run a little in college.

134
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:38,434
You still have some good rests.

135
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,698
I'm sure you could be
my Vanquished Paganism.

136
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,990
One of the central figures of my
big project for the Malemort Chapel.

137
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:54,998
It's a bit ridiculous to ask a
painter to be a model, don't you think?

138
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,410
You'll see, it won't be too exhausting.

139
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,041
My workroom is very cool.

140
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:05,730
I paint almost naked.

141
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:10,688
Then I said to Jacques. "Listen old pal
Helene is something else compared to Françoise.

142
00:14:11,155 --> 00:14:14,698
She won't be so easy to live with."
You know what Jacques said?

143
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:16,856
But...what are you thinking about?

144
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:19,845
You look like a lady patroness this morning.

145
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:23,885
Is it because of my family?
You're so open-minded usually.

146
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:26,976
Come on, I don't believe in
your morning nausea.

147
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:34,156
-Laurent?
-What?

148
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,116
I don't know. Sorry.

149
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:41,848
-I don't know how to say it.
-Say it!

150
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:45,435
You here...

151
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,498
It's not my business in the end.

152
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:52,784
-You don't want to come with us?
-What are you driving at?

153
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,271
Nothing.

154
00:14:55,788 --> 00:14:57,524
I think you're pale.

155
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,856
"Atmoshère, atmosphère"

156
00:15:00,177 --> 00:15:03,122
One never knows when you're
serious or you're bullshitting.

157
00:15:03,385 --> 00:15:05,412
Look how under-fed I am.

158
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:07,380
A real martyr.

159
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:09,960
But say...

160
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,437
it's you who don't look so well.
What's wrong with you?

161
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:15,661
-You look afraid.
-Don't be stupid.

162
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:17,629
So stop your false manners.

163
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:20,618
Come. They must worry about us.

164
00:15:21,624 --> 00:15:24,264
Look! I bring you a very sick girl!

165
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,617
-So we stay?
-We stay.

166
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:04,194
Wait for me.

167
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,101
Not there!

168
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:17,712
Why?

169
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,920
There's a corpse.

170
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:22,370
In shreds. It's horrible.

171
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:24,587
Oh yes, the sadic.

172
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,195
Here.

173
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:38,648
Go on. I'm staying here.
There's no-one.

174
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,059
We stay or what?

175
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:58,750
We stay.

176
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:03,284
We stay but you stop snooping
around Laurent like Sherlock Holmes.

177
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:08,811
I'm telling you. Either you're
crazy or he made a joke at your expense.

178
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,567
Or maybe both.
-That's rude of you.

179
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,272
And you didn't see him like I did.

180
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:15,650
Yes, I know.

181
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:20,898
Chained and imploring,
Mutilated and bleeding

182
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:23,435
-Let me laugh.
-Laugh then.

183
00:17:23,814 --> 00:17:26,497
We stay but give me a break
with your imagination.

184
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:35,333
Sorry, you came at the wrong time my sweet friends.

185
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:40,292
My father receives the country gentry once a year 
and it just falls tonight. The tuxedo is okay?

186
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:43,966
This year the evening dress
is beating all the length records.

187
00:17:44,593 --> 00:17:48,734
The train must be worn behind,
in front and on all sides.

188
00:17:57,555 --> 00:17:58,722
Walk barefoot.

189
00:17:59,582 --> 00:18:02,046
You're looking like the queen Ravanalona.

190
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,407
And if you put some bistre

191
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:14,440
even Mrs Lug will be
jealous of your exotic beauty.

192
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:17,997
Robert! Robert! I was looking
for you everywhere!

193
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:21,175
It's wonderful! Extraordinary!

194
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,412
You always amaze us!

195
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:28,218
Did I introduce you to our poet?
Jean-Loup. Robert Lorrain.

196
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,828
He's a Marquis. You don't
see that in Paris.

197
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:33,176
I introduce you to Mr and Mrs Lug.

198
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:44,395
-The bearded man is very attractive.
-Beware he's an ogre. The local Gilles de Rais.

199
00:18:44,504 --> 00:18:46,458
-He's coming to invite me.
-Refuse, refuse!

200
00:18:46,532 --> 00:18:49,557
-So you stopped the singing lessons? 
-Who's the dark handsome man?

201
00:18:49,623 --> 00:18:51,460
-You don't know?
-Helene...

202
00:18:51,606 --> 00:18:54,697
Don't turn your back. Look there.
The Bezin woman is behind you.

203
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:04,334
-He's talented? -Well you know,
lyrical abstraction but ten years late.

204
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:06,477
Good evening Mr canon.

205
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,591
-May I? -Good evening, you're
beautiful. -Please.

206
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:12,688
This is Jacques and Helene. The Popelin
canon. A great  admirer of my painting.

207
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,176
Good evening Miss.

208
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:15,970
So...

209
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:18,651
dear Mr Benedetti

210
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,562
is this sadic

211
00:19:20,795 --> 00:19:22,181
still running?

212
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:29,180
-Your magus looks great. Krishna-Murti,
the Beatles...And he crushed my hand.

213
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:43,586
Who's the dark handsome man?

214
00:19:54,596 --> 00:19:59,875
One of Laurent's old flirts. The viscountess 
Elfie de Liancourt now married to her cook.

215
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,745
She would be a nice woman if she did not 
think of herself as the new Michel-Angelo.

216
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:07,164
Her painting isn't worth anything.

217
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:11,612
In the end and to talk
frankly it's just shit.

218
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:17,736
-You saw Laurent?
-No. And you?

219
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:26,542
Helene, you're really crazy.

220
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:47,041
So?

221
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:48,565
Nothing.

222
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:49,702
You see.

223
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:56,146
Lucien. Allow me
to introduce you to

224
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,748
Mr and Mrs Klerk. Walerian Kostros.
-Pleased to meet you.

225
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:01,709
Thank you.

226
00:21:03,393 --> 00:21:06,163
-What do you think of our little party?
-It's superb.

227
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,381
Really?

228
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,400
-Elsa, did you see Elsa?
-So it's your turn to get suspicious.

229
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:12,572
Stay here. I'm going to take a look.

230
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:18,883
Milos my heart, don't
you have enough now?

231
00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:42,024
Jacques?

232
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:49,266
-You're looking for someone Miss?
-Where's Laurent?

233
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:50,979
Mr Laurent left.

234
00:22:52,036 --> 00:22:54,734
I saw Miss Elsa get inside her car.

235
00:22:55,098 --> 00:22:59,443
Mr Marquis left with some friends.
And these friends

236
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:03,365
also hit the road. I'm afraid
there's nobody left Miss.

237
00:23:03,788 --> 00:23:05,640
And Jacques? Where is Jacques?

238
00:23:06,267 --> 00:23:08,191
Mr Jacques? He's not in his room?

239
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:10,277
He probably went for a walk.

240
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,703
It's such a beautiful night.
One wants to walk, don't you think?

241
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,477
Bastard!

242
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:37,817
May I?

243
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:41,930
I'm so sorry.

244
00:23:42,608 --> 00:23:46,428
It was Walerian's idea you know.
Me I didn't agree

245
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,059
but your friend was so
receptive to the idea.

246
00:23:54,638 --> 00:23:58,589
It must be said that Walerian
do a bit of alchemy.

247
00:23:58,968 --> 00:24:01,403
Well, his own alchemy. By the way...

248
00:24:01,622 --> 00:24:04,757
always hid your meds when he's around.
He's crazy about them.

249
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:10,138
You know, the other day he gobbed the dog's 
suppositories. He ate them as if it they were candy.

250
00:24:11,114 --> 00:24:14,220
But what was I saying? Oh yes,
yesterday evening Walerian told us...

251
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:17,792
"You're not going to end the evening
like this. It's so gloomy."

252
00:24:17,982 --> 00:24:19,658
We searched for you everywhere

253
00:24:20,373 --> 00:24:24,878
but we couldn't find you. We thought you left with 
the Parturier to see their paintings collection.

254
00:24:25,054 --> 00:24:27,999
Since Jacques was alone he accompanied us.

255
00:24:29,296 --> 00:24:32,620
I have a cabin in the hills.
We get together there

256
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:37,053
between friends.
Walerian had promised us a surprise.

257
00:24:37,855 --> 00:24:43,352
He had prepared an extraordinary mix
much more powerful than LSD.

258
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:46,968
It was terribly exciting
but no dangerous at all.

259
00:24:49,024 --> 00:24:51,735
He took out his flask of sugar.

260
00:24:52,203 --> 00:24:56,256
Me I didn't take anything.
I hate that stuff.

261
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:59,654
Then he asked for a voluntary.
Of course

262
00:24:59,843 --> 00:25:02,482
he already had swallowed
some but without effect.

263
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,990
But of course nobody voluntereed.

264
00:25:05,603 --> 00:25:09,670
So we balloted for a "voluntary".

265
00:25:10,895 --> 00:25:13,344
And Jacques was the winner.

266
00:25:15,094 --> 00:25:18,375
Just after that I felt
a terrible remorse.

267
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:21,801
A boy so kind and so simple.

268
00:25:22,574 --> 00:25:27,050
At first it just makes the
effect of an aphrodisiac.

269
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:28,582
It's not that bad.

270
00:25:28,713 --> 00:25:33,189
-You poisoned him? -No, don't worry. He
only vomited a lot when we brought him back.

271
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:37,286
I think that with some sleep,
a bath and some rest...

272
00:25:38,554 --> 00:25:39,983
I was furious

273
00:25:40,187 --> 00:25:42,535
but Walerian found the
situation very funny.

274
00:25:42,637 --> 00:25:44,955
-What was so funny?
-Nothing.

275
00:25:45,436 --> 00:25:47,900
But Jacques was speaking
and acting like crazy.

276
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:50,511
-What a nice picture!
-Not bad...

277
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,669
not bad at all.

278
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:56,052
Wait for me.

279
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,657
I think I know who's the culprit.

280
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,246
That's his signature.

281
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:10,078
Your tea is served my queen and may the honey of 
the morning forecast the softness of your day.

282
00:26:20,474 --> 00:26:23,595
You seem to be in a superb
condition this morning.

283
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,504
It's clear that you're the most reasonable person in this house.

284
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:29,792
-The only one who went to sleep early.
-And Jacques, he is where?

285
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,802
You can't say "he is where?".
You must say "where is he?".

286
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,347
But it's true, where is Jacques?

287
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:37,578
Helene? Jacques is still in bed?

288
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:41,529
Excess of the night my dear.
Our "Bonaparte" is not used to party.

289
00:26:41,632 --> 00:26:44,665
Nothing serious by the way.
Isn't it Sir?

290
00:26:45,452 --> 00:26:48,441
A small indigestion like the one
I had yesterday.

291
00:26:48,878 --> 00:26:51,576
We're not used to your oil cooking.
To the same evil...

292
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:53,996
the same remedy. A cold bath.

293
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:56,329
John!

294
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,586
When you have some free time make
my sister say her lesson.

295
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:15,210
Did the sadic of the garrigue
strike again?

296
00:27:15,325 --> 00:27:18,942
A tourist has disappeared. But it's the
dark handsome man of yesterday evening.

297
00:27:22,018 --> 00:27:24,045
Hurry up. We're going now.

298
00:27:24,497 --> 00:27:26,144
Get dressed. We run away.

299
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,629
Laurent isn't coming to take us?

300
00:27:29,688 --> 00:27:32,823
Yeah right. Laurent comes and tomorrow 
our picture will make the frontline.

301
00:27:32,983 --> 00:27:35,884
Laurent will have to sort it
out himself. Me I'm leaving.

302
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:38,100
But Laurent can't...

303
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,878
Listen Jacko, you were right.

304
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:43,263
I'm stupid.

305
00:27:44,561 --> 00:27:48,745
The Lorrain are very nice people,
they only want the best for us.

306
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,236
They hold Laurent prisoner. Fine.
Elsa is a complete nympho.

307
00:27:53,557 --> 00:27:57,012
Her classification : the praying mantis.
You heard about them?

308
00:27:57,522 --> 00:28:00,745
The climax, the knuckleduster and death.

309
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:03,384
The daddy is a darling.

310
00:28:03,676 --> 00:28:06,680
He likes young people.
Some real sugar-daddy.

311
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:09,013
You tasted his sweets
yesterday, right?

312
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:13,693
Listen. They're all very nice.

313
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:16,405
I even begin to feel
comfortable here.

314
00:28:16,712 --> 00:28:19,964
But if I don't want to become completely
crazy I have to flee right away.

315
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,603
Do you understand love of my life?

316
00:28:24,586 --> 00:28:25,928
So Laurent...

317
00:28:27,254 --> 00:28:28,771
You know Laurent...

318
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:05,698
John.

319
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:08,298
You have your rifle?

320
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:31,977
What happened?

321
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:35,462
A flat tire I guess.

322
00:29:38,219 --> 00:29:39,735
You've got a flat?

323
00:29:45,115 --> 00:29:46,967
Laurent is not with you?

324
00:29:47,157 --> 00:29:49,038
So you were leaving?

325
00:29:49,563 --> 00:29:51,006
It's a scandal!

326
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:55,045
What's wrong? Did daddy do
something naughty?

327
00:29:56,474 --> 00:30:01,067
You're going to tell me everything.
Come on, Helene, Jacques, explain yourselves!

328
00:30:01,956 --> 00:30:06,221
In the end I'd rather not know. It's probably 
Laurent commiting some foolishness again.

329
00:30:06,607 --> 00:30:09,917
Where is he by the way? Come on,
get inside, don't stay here.

330
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,583
Now you're my prisoners.

331
00:30:19,307 --> 00:30:21,829
Hello? Number 5, Miss.

332
00:30:23,185 --> 00:30:24,643
Garage Delgado?

333
00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:26,961
Give me Mr Baille.

334
00:30:27,516 --> 00:30:28,711
No, the elder.

335
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:31,263
Hello Mickey?

336
00:30:31,701 --> 00:30:33,873
Elsa Lorrain. I'm fine.

337
00:30:34,748 --> 00:30:36,206
You can come up?

338
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:39,035
I have friends here with
a Deux-Chevaux.

339
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:40,712
They have a flat.

340
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:59,332
What? Not ready yet? You're crazy
to dress like that for a walk in the sun.

341
00:30:59,449 --> 00:31:02,146
-You wanted to leave?
-I packed our clothes.

342
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:06,142
-The room looked like we were
here for 6 months. -And why not?

343
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:08,636
Come on, get up, we're going
to swim.

344
00:31:08,913 --> 00:31:12,179
-Go both of you. I don't feel well.
-What do you mean?

345
00:31:12,295 --> 00:31:14,978
-I thought Jacques was not feeling well.
-He feels fine.

346
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,040
-Come on I tell you to go. -Just a quick
swim. I don't want to be in the sun at noon.

347
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:22,778
No regret then? So it's a boys date
and we'll have a drink at Julia's bar.

348
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:16,247
-Who's on the phone?
-It's Helene.

349
00:32:16,743 --> 00:32:18,726
You want to speak to Mr Marquis?

350
00:32:54,463 --> 00:32:56,388
Come in my dear.

351
00:33:02,395 --> 00:33:04,874
We played at Ivan the terrible.

352
00:33:05,005 --> 00:33:07,075
I hope it doesn't make
you uncomfortable.

353
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:09,350
No, it's rather interesting.

354
00:33:09,715 --> 00:33:12,820
You probably want to talk
to me dear Helene.

355
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,991
-I wanted to talk to you
in private. -In private?

356
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:21,263
-I must confess that I'm a bit worried.
-Worried about what good heavens?

357
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:24,370
I'm sorry Sir but I m not joking.

358
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:26,673
And me when I'm playing I'm not joking.

359
00:33:52,204 --> 00:33:54,114
You can talk now my dear.

360
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,555
-So I will speak.
-Good for you!

361
00:33:59,363 --> 00:34:02,992
Be aware you who lay here that my
soul is anxious and my body in stress.

362
00:34:03,065 --> 00:34:04,946
Really?

363
00:34:05,705 --> 00:34:08,941
Really. My nights are filled with
ferocious dreams and fearful screams.

364
00:34:09,043 --> 00:34:11,755
I see everywhere monsters on the
sly in the white shadows.

365
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:14,292
-Monsters?
-Monsters.

366
00:34:14,992 --> 00:34:16,945
The clawed one who devours.

367
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,570
The smiling one who poisons.

368
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,186
-They hold a prince charming
in their grip. -Charming?

369
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,790
Charming.

370
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,625
Each night they put him in chains.

371
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:30,521
Why?

372
00:34:31,294 --> 00:34:33,962
-He suffers and I love him.
-You love him.

373
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:37,935
I love him. I don't
care about the monsters.

374
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:43,061
If need be I will tame them and go
in their lair to see the prince again.

375
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:46,706
-If necessary I'll offer myself to the dragon to save him.
-Nobody asks this from you.

376
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,893
Right but something pushed me to do this.

377
00:34:49,607 --> 00:34:52,553
-And what is it beautiful fanatic?
-I don't know.

378
00:34:54,608 --> 00:34:57,932
I'd like to pierce the darkness
and light the fire

379
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:01,184
in the darkness of the souls.
-Swell!

380
00:35:01,593 --> 00:35:03,751
Oh, you tried to kiss me!

381
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:07,353
I'm the eternal temptress.

382
00:35:07,615 --> 00:35:10,065
The woman. I'm yours
against your secret.

383
00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:13,855
I will display on you
all my perverse weapons.

384
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:17,253
Let's stop the play a moment.
What do you want exactly?

385
00:35:18,113 --> 00:35:19,061
Nothing.

386
00:35:19,921 --> 00:35:21,292
I was just playing.

387
00:35:21,802 --> 00:35:23,464
-I was wrong?
-No...

388
00:35:24,062 --> 00:35:27,663
but you must warn me when the
play becomes very serious.

389
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:32,489
I know the mystery
of the dark temples.

390
00:35:32,606 --> 00:35:34,064
Is that so?

391
00:35:34,313 --> 00:35:36,544
The temple of the forbidden scents.

392
00:35:36,908 --> 00:35:39,008
The temple of inhuman passion.

393
00:35:39,285 --> 00:35:42,113
The temple of sacrifices.
-Of sacrifices?

394
00:35:42,886 --> 00:35:44,330
The temple of sacrifices.

395
00:35:45,307 --> 00:35:47,436
-You know him too.
-Me?

396
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:51,897
Didn't the oracle of the day
acknowledge the last sacrifice?

397
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,705
The oracle made a blunder.

398
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:58,269
Can you shed some light on me, you
who know this mystery's deepest arcanes?

399
00:35:58,386 --> 00:35:59,654
Listen.

400
00:36:00,005 --> 00:36:04,422
O you who come dressed with
white linen and ingenuous probity.

401
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:06,624
Listen to my word.

402
00:36:06,887 --> 00:36:10,051
The prince is no prisonner
of the infernal forces.

403
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:11,815
The prince is free.

404
00:36:12,077 --> 00:36:16,131
Only a spell gives you the impression
that he's chained to the monster. He's pure.

405
00:36:17,064 --> 00:36:18,945
And he's yours if you want him.

406
00:36:19,412 --> 00:36:23,844
But will you be strong enough to lead him out 
of the bloody places where he's prowling?

407
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:25,230
I'll be strong.

408
00:36:25,463 --> 00:36:28,131
Take his hand and leave.
-Really?

409
00:36:28,481 --> 00:36:30,842
Yes. I give you my blessing.

410
00:36:33,132 --> 00:36:36,194
What's wrong with you my dear
Helene? You seem really excited.

411
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:38,410
-I'm happy.
-For what reason?

412
00:36:38,658 --> 00:36:40,247
Because of your blessing.

413
00:36:45,948 --> 00:36:47,435
I stop playing.

414
00:36:48,632 --> 00:36:51,752
You're really lovely Helene.
I mean it.

415
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:54,179
So you love Laurent?

416
00:36:55,485 --> 00:36:57,089
It's not so astonishing.

417
00:36:57,482 --> 00:37:00,252
But will Laurent love you?

418
00:37:08,084 --> 00:37:09,877
I'm afraid not.

419
00:37:14,616 --> 00:37:16,832
I'm going to be frank with you.

420
00:37:17,197 --> 00:37:18,699
Laurent makes me worry.

421
00:37:19,092 --> 00:37:20,827
Laurent is not simple.

422
00:37:21,483 --> 00:37:23,503
Laurent is hiding everything from us.

423
00:37:23,626 --> 00:37:25,150
I fear the worst.

424
00:37:27,752 --> 00:37:29,677
I know what you think.

425
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:32,637
What's bred in the bone will
come out in the flesh.

426
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:34,780
But you're mistaken dear Helene.

427
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,755
Laurent is not of our kin.

428
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:40,598
Laurent doesn't play.

429
00:37:41,574 --> 00:37:44,243
There's a certain
darkness inside of him.

430
00:37:44,593 --> 00:37:46,721
Don't laugh. In the end

431
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,141
I'm happy to see
you interested in him.

432
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:54,740
I'd like to make a pact with you.
A pact to save his soul.

433
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:59,654
It's a good thing that Laurent is
interested in a girl like you.

434
00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:04,014
You must admit that I'm not
the most conventional father but yet

435
00:38:04,524 --> 00:38:06,376
for once

436
00:38:06,624 --> 00:38:10,284
I'd like to speak like father
Duval but in reverse.

437
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:13,827
Since all is in reverse in this house.

438
00:38:14,104 --> 00:38:15,372
Take my son

439
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,769
and transform it to your
exquisite image.

440
00:38:20,023 --> 00:38:21,744
You believe me, don't you?

441
00:38:21,977 --> 00:38:25,083
He needs a kind person like you.

442
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,591
We're not kind people.

443
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,694
You're curious my dear

444
00:38:33,657 --> 00:38:35,494
and I like that.

445
00:38:36,616 --> 00:38:39,445
You must find me a bit strange,

446
00:38:40,378 --> 00:38:41,617
odd,

447
00:38:43,032 --> 00:38:45,744
peculiar as people say.

448
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:50,599
This is beautiful.

449
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:54,200
-What is it?
-One of my magical sculptures.

450
00:38:55,307 --> 00:38:59,040
Did you notice that bottle
containing nun's blood?

451
00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:02,131
And hee is the denture
of Count Hugo d'Alesy.

452
00:39:02,452 --> 00:39:03,851
Would you be tempted

453
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,045
by a more advanced experiment?

454
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:10,136
The thrill of the kill.

455
00:39:11,245 --> 00:39:15,634
Only words dear Helene.
You talk like a girl of your time.

456
00:39:16,246 --> 00:39:18,754
For you thought is limitless.

457
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:21,218
But I'm getting old.

458
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,274
I have principles.

459
00:39:24,149 --> 00:39:25,578
You're not tempted?

460
00:39:26,686 --> 00:39:28,655
A little boy by the moonlight?

461
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:30,098


462
00:39:30,681 --> 00:39:32,664
His throat sliced up and down.

463
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,511
Go little girl.

464
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,471
Leave me in my silence.

465
00:39:48,106 --> 00:39:50,920
I loathe these kind of vulgarities.

466
00:39:51,241 --> 00:39:52,743
Knife stabbing,

467
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:56,461
scalped hair, and blood spurting out.

468
00:39:56,986 --> 00:40:00,645
On your way out please
call back my "Opritchniki".

469
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:03,174
Thank you for everything Sir.

470
00:40:03,795 --> 00:40:05,049
By the way...

471
00:40:05,588 --> 00:40:07,586
I'm sorry to ask but...

472
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:09,233
where is Walerian?

473
00:40:09,729 --> 00:40:10,896
After all...

474
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:14,177
it's his fault if
I had such an awful night.

475
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:17,166
-This laborious morning wake.
-Walerian?

476
00:40:17,603 --> 00:40:19,557
I killed Walerian.

477
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:22,590
There was something rotten inside him.

478
00:40:22,896 --> 00:40:26,469
I cannot tolerate anyone that
isn't pure around me.

479
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:29,327
Pure as the night.

480
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:32,579
Good day Mr Lorrain.

481
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:39,132
Only banquets and feasts are allowed
while the noble foreigners are amongst us.

482
00:41:39,293 --> 00:41:42,472
Chamber music obligatory.
No formal dress.

483
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:44,586
A piece of mink will do.

484
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,904
That's for you old girl.

485
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:52,781
So?

486
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:55,741
-So what?
-"So what?"

487
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,439
So you didn't grilled him?

488
00:41:58,861 --> 00:42:00,844
So you surely had a good swim.

489
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:03,644
And you surely had some
good time at the inn.

490
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:07,172
And you surely told him nothing
about your escapade last night.

491
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,213
In sum...

492
00:42:09,461 --> 00:42:11,780
it was a delicious morning

493
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,360
for two well-behaved healthy boys.

494
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:16,926
Really very emotional.

495
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:48,565
Helene...

496
00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:53,734
There're certain places where the horrible noises 
of modern music should be prohibited.

497
00:42:53,814 --> 00:42:55,258
They broke my ears.

498
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:58,115
I don't hate it. What's
your opinion Jacques?

499
00:42:58,641 --> 00:43:01,600
It seemed that when you didn't
sleep your teeth were creaking.

500
00:43:01,936 --> 00:43:04,765
The day you don't try to
humiliate me you'll be dead.

501
00:43:06,368 --> 00:43:10,465
-Who made you listen to Boulez
for the first time? -It's true.
You're unfair Helene.

502
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:13,002
Jacques resisted all he could.

503
00:43:13,265 --> 00:43:15,919
And he has some merit.

504
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:19,885
If that first violin was not
so good-looking

505
00:43:19,986 --> 00:43:22,669
I think I would have left
after the first time.

506
00:43:42,616 --> 00:43:44,861
Do you come for a last
drink at my place?

507
00:43:45,401 --> 00:43:47,267
I think Jacques is falling asleep.

508
00:43:47,428 --> 00:43:51,569
The poor boy. We give him
such a rough time.

509
00:44:25,425 --> 00:44:27,802
-What's that noise?
-A bird or a beast...

510
00:44:27,962 --> 00:44:29,756
Cover me, I'm cold.

511
00:45:21,794 --> 00:45:24,652
The water was almost lukewarm.
Even the wind is hot.

512
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:28,246
And to say I damned myself for
forgetting my towel rail in Paris.

513
00:45:38,226 --> 00:45:40,996
I didn't tell you but I had a
long talk with your father yesterday.

514
00:45:41,128 --> 00:45:42,900
In the end you were right.

515
00:45:42,994 --> 00:45:45,167
He's very funny, very nice.

516
00:45:48,098 --> 00:45:49,512
Don't you think?

517
00:45:50,037 --> 00:45:51,364
Yes, yes.

518
00:45:51,953 --> 00:45:53,499
You should be happy.

519
00:45:54,782 --> 00:45:57,654
-I wasn't scared by his museum
-So he gave you a visit?

520
00:45:58,631 --> 00:45:59,579
Yes.

521
00:46:00,396 --> 00:46:01,547
It's very funny.

522
00:46:02,276 --> 00:46:04,784
Funny? You think it's funny?

523
00:46:09,479 --> 00:46:11,725
Why did you scream yesterday night?

524
00:46:18,796 --> 00:46:20,575
How could I not scream?

525
00:46:21,406 --> 00:46:23,025
-I saw you.
-What?

526
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:25,489
I saw you yesterday night.

527
00:46:25,897 --> 00:46:28,128
As I saw you that first night.
-What?

528
00:46:29,499 --> 00:46:30,651
I'm sorry.

529
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:33,144
I should not have.

530
00:46:33,538 --> 00:46:35,054
I was stupid.

531
00:46:35,346 --> 00:46:36,760
I was afraid you know.

532
00:46:38,174 --> 00:46:39,268
Forget it.

533
00:46:40,551 --> 00:46:42,228
Let's not talk again.

534
00:47:33,522 --> 00:47:35,199
How can I help you Miss?

535
00:47:45,828 --> 00:47:46,863
Laurent...

536
00:47:52,783 --> 00:47:53,702
Milos!

537
00:47:54,095 --> 00:47:55,116
Milos!

538
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,405
She's conscious now?

539
00:47:57,929 --> 00:48:00,145
What is she mumbling about?
-I don't know.

540
00:48:00,598 --> 00:48:03,630
Go and see in her car.
-In her car? -I tell you to go.

541
00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:08,223
-It's the car of Mr Lorrain's son.
-There's no-one?

542
00:48:08,413 --> 00:48:09,492
No-one.

543
00:48:11,038 --> 00:48:13,188
Someone was accompanying you?

544
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,631
You were alone?

545
00:48:22,804 --> 00:48:24,087
Someone with you?

546
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,183
What happened to him?

547
00:48:31,247 --> 00:48:33,449
It's not Mr Laurent's
type to make jokes.

548
00:48:33,595 --> 00:48:35,826
He was pretty bad
when I came in your bar.

549
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:38,699
That's the reason I stopped
in front of you.

550
00:48:39,515 --> 00:48:42,898
He was shaky and delirious.
The sun probably.

551
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,585
-You know them well the Lorrain?
-A little.

552
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,376
I don't know how to say this.

553
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,335
Don't you find them...peculiar?

554
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:59,710
Peculiar? That's the
least you could say. Look.

555
00:49:00,147 --> 00:49:01,751
I still bear her mark.

556
00:49:02,144 --> 00:49:05,031
-It's you the other night...
-who was corrected by her. Yes.

557
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,320
It's one of her guilty pleasures.
-Pleasures?

558
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:10,616
You don't know her. She's
crazy. She knows how to concoct a plan.

559
00:49:10,732 --> 00:49:13,371
And she doesn't like when it's fake.

560
00:49:13,648 --> 00:49:17,410
But I'm not the kind of man you push like 
that. So the other night she asked for me.

561
00:49:17,556 --> 00:49:19,794
While she was having sex
with the other guy.

562
00:49:19,918 --> 00:49:21,814
It gets her excited, you know.

563
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,665
That's the beautiful Elsa.

564
00:49:23,869 --> 00:49:25,371
That rotten Lady.

565
00:49:29,643 --> 00:49:30,634
But you?

566
00:49:30,999 --> 00:49:32,019
You love her?

567
00:49:32,355 --> 00:49:33,463
Maybe.

568
00:49:33,915 --> 00:49:36,000
-And her?
-Oh, her...

569
00:49:36,379 --> 00:49:39,397
She needs all the guys
and then she sacks them.

570
00:49:40,345 --> 00:49:41,818
I'm not that kind.

571
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:43,451
So we had a brawl.

572
00:49:43,786 --> 00:49:44,821
I saw that.

573
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:47,665
You saw?

574
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:50,844
I was there. Not on purpose.

575
00:49:51,296 --> 00:49:52,797
You have some nerves!

576
00:50:01,677 --> 00:50:03,266
-And the other?
-The other?

577
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,066
Your rival from the other night.
Is he dead?

578
00:50:06,372 --> 00:50:07,990
He's much better now.

579
00:50:08,268 --> 00:50:11,074
When you pass in front of
the antics shop sound your horn.

580
00:50:11,213 --> 00:50:13,036
You will see him at the window.

581
00:50:13,765 --> 00:50:17,119
The newspaper article, it was to
ridiculise Benedetti.

582
00:50:18,096 --> 00:50:19,845
He's easily fooled.

583
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,875
You made us afraid.

584
00:50:43,351 --> 00:50:44,794
You'll go up there again?

585
00:50:46,981 --> 00:50:48,483
And to the gas station?

586
00:50:48,862 --> 00:50:51,618
-You will go there again?
-It's still my job.

587
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:53,834
Don't you like being here?

588
00:50:54,272 --> 00:50:55,788
And your husband?

589
00:50:56,298 --> 00:50:57,727
Does he bother you?

590
00:50:58,427 --> 00:50:59,375
Stay.

591
00:50:59,871 --> 00:51:01,897
Stay with your nurse.

592
00:51:02,336 --> 00:51:04,800
-I made a good job on you, right?
-And me?

593
00:51:07,366 --> 00:51:10,253
You have a very special way
of revealing well-known people.

594
00:51:12,863 --> 00:51:15,342
You reveal a lot about yourself at the same time.

595
00:51:15,502 --> 00:51:16,836
Without a doubt.

596
00:51:17,777 --> 00:51:22,166
It is characteristic of the artist,
isn't it? We always do a self-portrait.

597
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:24,951
Even painting a still life

598
00:51:25,447 --> 00:51:26,599
or...

599
00:51:27,313 --> 00:51:28,742
a muscle.

600
00:51:31,571 --> 00:51:32,606
And Laurent?

601
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:35,479
You have terminated him?

602
00:51:36,324 --> 00:51:38,278
It's rare to see you alone.

603
00:51:38,439 --> 00:51:41,092
-You noticed that?
-It wasn't a nasty remark.

604
00:51:42,609 --> 00:51:43,702
I know.

605
00:51:44,329 --> 00:51:45,933
No, I didn't "terminate" him.

606
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,712
But maybe it's worse.

607
00:51:47,989 --> 00:51:49,302
What do you mean?

608
00:51:49,768 --> 00:51:51,051
I don't know.

609
00:51:52,626 --> 00:51:55,426
-He's teribly sick.
-Sick?

610
00:51:56,563 --> 00:51:58,473
And terribly lucid.

611
00:52:02,016 --> 00:52:06,186
-In the car earlier he had a syncope.
-A syncope, you're sure?

612
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:09,336
Or a sunstroke.

613
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:12,369
Something like that.
-Laurent is solid as a rock.

614
00:52:13,142 --> 00:52:16,729
My dear Helene let me tell you
that you're much too impressionable.

615
00:52:17,414 --> 00:52:18,930
For instance...

616
00:52:19,091 --> 00:52:21,074
You mustn't let people see

617
00:52:21,526 --> 00:52:24,209
and hear your emotions by the moolight.

618
00:52:27,008 --> 00:52:30,668
Jacques! The pose! You're terrible!

619
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:32,665
I'm sorry.

620
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:35,654
He's not as docile as that you know.

621
00:52:54,843 --> 00:52:56,666
Beware! You moved again.

622
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,806
-It's Milos?
-You know him?

623
00:53:01,214 --> 00:53:02,600
I've seen him here.

624
00:53:02,993 --> 00:53:04,262
Yes, I remember.

625
00:53:05,326 --> 00:53:06,624
Not bad.

626
00:53:06,886 --> 00:53:08,505
Yes he's an handsome guy.

627
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:11,800
A complete moron but some deltoides...

628
00:53:13,476 --> 00:53:15,255
You roughed him good.

629
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:19,936
-How do you know that?
-I saw him earlier at the Inn.

630
00:53:20,826 --> 00:53:22,868
By chance.
-I hope so.

631
00:53:22,955 --> 00:53:24,107
And then?

632
00:53:25,186 --> 00:53:27,096
-Then nothing.
-Nothing?

633
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:29,240
It's hard to imagine from Milos.

634
00:53:29,604 --> 00:53:31,208
I had no heart to it.

635
00:53:31,339 --> 00:53:34,139
But he has the heart
to it all the time.

636
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:37,435
He's so sticky, so smoochy...

637
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:40,890
I don't know any attendant
more sentimental in the area.

638
00:53:50,805 --> 00:53:52,934
There's a temptation of sublime...

639
00:53:54,858 --> 00:53:55,821
and then...

640
00:53:56,141 --> 00:53:57,731
lots of flesh..

641
00:53:59,276 --> 00:54:02,659
in its most bestial aspect.
-If you say so...

642
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:09,950
And the suffering of others...

643
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:12,735
driving you.

644
00:54:15,009 --> 00:54:16,409
Where does it come from?

645
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:21,614
Well, I mean...

646
00:54:23,408 --> 00:54:25,683
Is it only in your imagination?

647
00:54:27,825 --> 00:54:30,347
Or does it have its origin in reality?

648
00:54:31,864 --> 00:54:34,211
It's not so simple my dear Helene.

649
00:54:34,678 --> 00:54:37,156
-Helene has left?
-A minute ago.

650
00:54:38,061 --> 00:54:39,337
Where are you?

651
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:41,794
I'm changing clothes.
Stay where you are.

652
00:54:42,669 --> 00:54:45,104
-You have a nice touch.
-Don't say anything.

653
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,852
You don't give a damn about my touch
and you're right.

654
00:54:50,864 --> 00:54:52,905
Show me your talent instead.

655
00:54:53,211 --> 00:54:54,378
I love you.

656
00:54:54,742 --> 00:54:56,914
But admit that you're a
little bit afraid.

657
00:54:59,335 --> 00:55:03,301
Afraid? No. It's Helene who see
monsters everywhere. She's naive.

658
00:55:03,942 --> 00:55:06,202
You, a monster? That's a joke.

659
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:08,419
You so beautiful and so sweet.

660
00:55:10,008 --> 00:55:12,698
I would never have thought
that a man like me...

661
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:22,459
You hurted me.

662
00:55:33,335 --> 00:55:36,178
Daddy, you'll be caught one of these days.

663
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,896
Walerian is the fifth one this year.

664
00:55:41,193 --> 00:55:44,182
Well, at least now my rings
won't disappear anymore.

665
00:55:44,751 --> 00:55:48,804
Unless one of your mechanic
is also a goldsmith.

666
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,627
Beside...

667
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:53,266
where is the handsome Milos?

668
00:55:53,528 --> 00:55:56,838
We haven't seen him for a while.

669
00:56:01,722 --> 00:56:03,654
I'm better, Helene.
I'm much better.

670
00:56:03,764 --> 00:56:06,666
It's unbelievable. He has no
right over that. No right at all.

671
00:56:06,943 --> 00:56:11,084
It's intolerable to be disturbed
during the diner. I'm coming John.

672
00:57:34,965 --> 00:57:38,946
No Walerian! You won't come back here and
you won't take back these art pieces.

673
00:57:39,106 --> 00:57:42,183
You know perfectly how much I
have given you to own them. Go away!

674
00:57:42,387 --> 00:57:45,245
A name is a sacred thing.
Never forget it.

675
00:57:45,376 --> 00:57:49,124
I was crazy and you abused me.
What did I look like? No!

676
00:57:49,429 --> 00:57:52,491
You're not my faithful servant anymore.
Guard!

677
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:54,999
Throw him away!

678
00:57:56,136 --> 00:57:58,702
-I'll tell everything.
-I guess it's already done.

679
00:57:58,789 --> 00:58:00,452
You're a great cunt.

680
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:04,024
You don't amuse me anymore...

681
00:58:04,243 --> 00:58:06,692
you and your pharmacian smell.
Just go.

682
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:09,900
And keep your injuries for better occasions.

683
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:13,137
They will not fail I guess.

684
00:58:16,928 --> 00:58:18,182
Who's there?

685
00:58:18,897 --> 00:58:20,267
It's you Milos?

686
00:58:21,317 --> 00:58:22,761
It's Walerian.

687
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:24,335
What do you want?

688
00:58:25,181 --> 00:58:27,091
-I'm working.
-I want to see you.

689
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,451
-Come back tomorrow.
-I have things to tell you.

690
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:34,250
-I already know them.
-Open.

691
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:37,168
Go away now dirty little fetus!

692
00:58:37,401 --> 00:58:38,801
You will regret it.

693
00:58:41,031 --> 00:58:43,044
Walerian. You know him.

694
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,018
One of daddy's damned soul.

695
00:58:46,733 --> 00:58:49,415
I hate to be involved in
their sordid business.

696
00:58:50,582 --> 00:58:52,245
You know the rumours about him?

697
00:58:53,338 --> 00:58:57,027
His guilty pleasure is to drug the
poor guys drifting in the area and then...

698
00:58:57,756 --> 00:58:58,675
And then?

699
00:58:59,695 --> 00:59:01,474
Don't play the choirboy.

700
00:59:05,352 --> 00:59:07,554
Laurent, your father is chasing me.

701
00:59:08,341 --> 00:59:09,668
I'd like to see you.

702
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:12,248
Open. Remember how I helped you.

703
00:59:12,832 --> 00:59:14,829
My small services.

704
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:01,984
-Where are you going?
-Somewhere else.

705
01:00:03,471 --> 01:00:04,798
I forbid you!

706
01:00:04,944 --> 01:00:07,131
Listen. I need a change.
I need to drive.

707
01:00:07,247 --> 01:00:09,624
At this hour the Casanovas
like you are sleeping.

708
01:00:27,236 --> 01:00:28,330
Silly boy.

709
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,473
I'm hurt.

710
01:00:35,095 --> 01:00:36,203
I'm hurt.

711
01:00:37,603 --> 01:00:39,761
Yeah, I heard.

712
01:00:51,484 --> 01:00:53,030
-Where you going?
-Salon.

713
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:54,502
Jump behind.

714
01:00:56,324 --> 01:00:58,103
Now get out.

715
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:00,319
-But Elsa...
-I told you to get out.

716
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:04,416
Get out. There's an Inn nearby. Go
there and get drunk if it can help you.

717
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,418
-Let me stay with you...-Sir could you please 
oblige me and kick this man out of my car.

718
01:01:09,797 --> 01:01:11,743
It's your car? What do you want me to do?

719
01:01:11,823 --> 01:01:12,851
Dump him.

720
01:01:13,267 --> 01:01:16,044
-Like that? On the edge of the road?
-Where you want.

721
01:01:17,146 --> 01:01:20,324
Come on, come on...

722
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:34,497
You said you were going to...

723
01:01:35,226 --> 01:01:36,159
Salon.

724
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:37,807
Salon or any other place.

725
01:01:48,363 --> 01:01:51,789
Hey Julia, your bar looks like
the urgency ward.

726
01:01:52,431 --> 01:01:54,385
-Accident?
-An alcohol please.

727
01:01:55,085 --> 01:01:57,884
-So they dumped you too?
-I don't know you Mister.

728
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,985
Don't talk to me.

729
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,340
Don't take your high-class
tone with me duchess.

730
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,272
You saw the mash
she made out of your face?

731
01:02:06,386 --> 01:02:07,844
Between renegades...

732
01:02:08,252 --> 01:02:11,372
we can still have a talk. -Leave me
alone. I don't need your support.

733
01:02:11,474 --> 01:02:13,946
Can I sleep here tonight?
-Yes, of course.

734
01:02:14,033 --> 01:02:16,446
So it's more serious than I thought.

735
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:20,266
-Much more serious.
-I told you to stay away from me.

736
01:02:21,855 --> 01:02:23,517
Is it Laurent scaring you?

737
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:27,118
-Laurent...why Laurent?
-Maybe you're jealous.

738
01:02:27,235 --> 01:02:29,290
Maybe boys are still
jealous in Paris.

739
01:02:29,582 --> 01:02:31,201
Jealous for what reason?

740
01:02:32,935 --> 01:02:34,204
You don't know?

741
01:02:34,598 --> 01:02:36,661
Your girlfriend and Laurent...

742
01:02:40,314 --> 01:02:42,909
I didn't fly yet. We just
finished training.

743
01:02:43,332 --> 01:02:45,447
Can I go and play now?

744
01:02:45,884 --> 01:02:47,575
It's not funny this morning.

745
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,666
Here are our two love birds.

746
01:02:50,754 --> 01:02:53,407
Don't you think they make
a nice couple Elsa?

747
01:02:53,641 --> 01:02:56,149
You must be very discret you and Jacques.

748
01:02:56,702 --> 01:02:58,802
You will pack and leave.

749
01:03:00,274 --> 01:03:03,103
Leave us and forget.

750
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:06,996
You can't help me.

751
01:03:11,184 --> 01:03:11,811
Go.

752
01:03:19,522 --> 01:03:20,338
Sorry.

753
01:04:49,714 --> 01:04:51,085
I will pay you later.

754
01:04:51,216 --> 01:04:53,986
-Thank you for your kindness.
-Please. This is quite normal.

755
01:04:54,759 --> 01:04:57,339
Beware the sun. It's strong at this hour.

756
01:04:58,142 --> 01:05:00,344
Who's this guy?
-Nothing.

757
01:05:01,116 --> 01:05:04,718
A guest at the Marquis.
Calm down, it's not the sadic.

758
01:05:05,111 --> 01:05:07,794
You can never know.
With his ugly mug...

759
01:05:08,056 --> 01:05:10,229
he fits well in the crowd up there.

760
01:05:21,253 --> 01:05:23,841
Where are you going Helene?
You're not staying with us?

761
01:12:20,814 --> 01:12:25,611
We will loot every house in town!
Burn everything!

762
01:12:26,019 --> 01:12:29,446
Rape women and children!
Behead the bodied men!

763
01:12:29,796 --> 01:12:31,648
Skin the old ones!

764
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:34,768
Me I'm going to rest
in the royal tent.

765
01:12:36,809 --> 01:12:40,308
So it was you!  Well you've got
your car now. Why didn't you leave?

766
01:12:49,013 --> 01:12:51,696
-What does it mean?
-Stupid fool!

767
01:12:52,819 --> 01:12:55,064
-You're crazy! You became crazy!
-Yes.

768
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:58,489
And you think I'll let you quiet and easy?

769
01:12:58,548 --> 01:13:01,129
That I will let you
play with your "toys"?

770
01:13:01,245 --> 01:13:03,366
Give me this. I'll bring
it to the police.

771
01:13:03,476 --> 01:13:07,245
They'll be interested. You heard about the sadic of the garrigue, right?

772
01:13:07,413 --> 01:13:08,988
You don't know what you say.

773
01:13:09,396 --> 01:13:11,065
You don't know what you do.

774
01:13:11,306 --> 01:13:12,881
I know both very well.

775
01:13:13,158 --> 01:13:14,761
You don't know nothing.

776
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:17,707
I know enough to catch the
cops attention.

777
01:13:17,882 --> 01:13:19,982
-You won't do it.
-It won't embarass me.

778
01:13:22,505 --> 01:13:23,846
You will do nothing.

779
01:13:33,849 --> 01:13:39,827
Prince Jacques, what a surprise. You're looking 
for Elsa? She's napping. Come play with us.

780
01:14:08,505 --> 01:14:11,961
You're looking for Prince Jacques?
He's my prisoner.

781
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:14,148
-John.
-Miss?

782
01:14:14,396 --> 01:14:16,583
The adress book please?

783
01:14:17,837 --> 01:14:19,878
It's here Miss.

784
01:14:20,068 --> 01:14:22,212
No, give it to me.
I can find alone.

785
01:14:34,735 --> 01:14:36,587
Number 15 in Sannes please.

786
01:14:38,745 --> 01:14:40,101
What a surprise.

787
01:14:40,816 --> 01:14:41,574
Yes.

788
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:46,007
Something to put someone to sleep.
You're insomniac?

789
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:48,879
For Jacques.

790
01:14:49,258 --> 01:14:51,204
Alright I'll keep it for myself.

791
01:14:51,431 --> 01:14:54,485
You're quite deceptive with your
wise little girl looks.

792
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:56,454
Strong?

793
01:14:57,045 --> 01:14:59,859
Powerful? Not lethal at least?

794
01:15:02,323 --> 01:15:03,781
Yes I'm coming.

795
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:05,851
Don't mention it.

796
01:15:07,178 --> 01:15:09,001
The pleasure is mine.

797
01:15:25,157 --> 01:15:27,694
We swim into anarchy.

798
01:15:28,058 --> 01:15:32,709
Can you tell me Sir what my daughter is doing 
now? I guess you don' know about the rest.

799
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:37,885
Miss Elsa is resting I think. She told me to go to diner 
alone and I said I was embarassed to do that...

800
01:15:38,046 --> 01:15:42,056
It's unbelievable! If it keeps on like
this I will have my meals in my office!

801
01:15:42,391 --> 01:15:45,263
Nice family life, don't you think?

802
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:56,738
Sir will have another
plate of cold soup?

803
01:16:29,135 --> 01:16:32,693
It's not anarchy anymore. It's
a complete organized mess!

804
01:16:33,204 --> 01:16:36,674
John didn't even put the kid to sleep!
That's unheard of!

805
01:17:25,784 --> 01:17:27,271
Interesting...

806
01:17:53,092 --> 01:17:54,784
Sir! Sir!

807
01:17:55,513 --> 01:17:58,181
I'm terribly sorry.
I had such a busy day.

808
01:17:58,283 --> 01:18:01,935
-The groceries, the washing, I didn't think
the little Miss...-It doesn't matter.

809
01:18:02,059 --> 01:18:05,077
Can you keep her for the night?
I need her bedroom.

810
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:09,195
Of course Sir.
She'll be there like in her room.

811
01:18:15,647 --> 01:18:17,579
There's somebody at your place?

812
01:18:17,747 --> 01:18:19,424
Who could be there?

813
01:18:26,233 --> 01:18:28,055
See you tomorrow at noon.

814
01:18:50,890 --> 01:18:52,582
No. Don't say anything.

815
01:18:52,917 --> 01:18:54,856
I call to our past friendship.

816
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:59,186
To a tradition of hospitality that you
prided yourself on yesterday evening.

817
01:18:59,362 --> 01:19:02,183
I admit that this art pieces business
was ridiculous.

818
01:19:02,293 --> 01:19:05,238
But admit yourself that your
reproachs were hypocrital.

819
01:19:05,398 --> 01:19:06,842
Come on, Bob...

820
01:19:07,512 --> 01:19:09,648
Admit that you get bored without me.

821
01:19:09,918 --> 01:19:11,186
Same is true for me.

822
01:19:11,332 --> 01:19:15,567
That's where you're wrong my sweet Walerian. We've 
no time to get bored anymore in this house.

823
01:19:15,691 --> 01:19:21,407
I found something unbelievable and you know
where of all places ? In the kid's room.

824
01:19:21,976 --> 01:19:25,111
I found a sublime stigma on Jacques body.

825
01:19:25,708 --> 01:19:29,033
You remember the leopard-men in Congo?

826
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:32,022
You remember these splendid
claws they used?

827
01:19:33,334 --> 01:19:36,557
-Don't you read the newspapers?
-You had better reading tastes in the past.

828
01:19:36,673 --> 01:19:41,368
I had guessed from reading Benedetti's
wordy articles that the sadic

829
01:19:41,557 --> 01:19:45,640
used a special tool. And it
striked me when I saw Jacques body.

830
01:19:46,077 --> 01:19:48,279
-You mean that...
-The sadic is amongst us my dear.

831
01:19:48,439 --> 01:19:50,976
He's here. Isn't it wondeful?

832
01:19:53,878 --> 01:19:55,656
You're not suspecting me at least?

833
01:20:49,243 --> 01:20:51,692
-What's that noise?
-You repeat yourself.

834
01:20:52,101 --> 01:20:54,346
I'm telling you there's nobody.

835
01:20:55,775 --> 01:20:56,840
You're afraid?

836
01:20:57,831 --> 01:20:58,764
Tell me...

837
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:01,127
-You're afraid?
-You're kidding me?

838
01:21:05,995 --> 01:21:09,145
I was left alone in the dining room.
What shall I do?

839
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:12,324
I'd like to go home unless you
let me sleep here another night.

840
01:21:12,455 --> 01:21:14,482
-I don't like him.
-Beat him up.

841
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:19,534
-You're too excited, Bob.
-Admit that I have my reasons!

842
01:21:33,073 --> 01:21:35,173
They come out of the woods

843
01:21:35,609 --> 01:21:38,846
at the meridian hour, noon or midnight.

844
01:21:39,195 --> 01:21:43,176
Dressed with animal skins
and their face covered by hoods.

845
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:49,008
They wear at their fingers artificials
nails made of horn or iron

846
01:21:49,635 --> 01:21:52,580
which they use to shred their preys.

847
01:21:54,286 --> 01:21:55,584
It's almost midnight.

848
01:21:56,094 --> 01:21:57,757
And the moon is full.

849
01:21:58,092 --> 01:22:00,993
If you're right your sadic
will make some delicatessen soon.

850
01:22:01,547 --> 01:22:03,895
Maybe he'll finish what
he started on Jacques.

851
01:22:04,901 --> 01:22:07,147
-Poor Jacques.
-What are we doing now?

852
01:22:07,292 --> 01:22:09,990
-We wait. -What do we wait?
-Midnight -And then?

853
01:22:10,602 --> 01:22:11,710
Listen.

854
01:22:25,737 --> 01:22:27,334
Sleep little bitch!

855
01:22:30,534 --> 01:22:32,021
Where are you going?

856
01:22:54,621 --> 01:22:57,070
Another victim of your sadic?

857
01:23:00,293 --> 01:23:04,930
-Please, don't ask me again who he is.
-I know him. It's Elsa's last find.

858
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:09,333
Here we are. No need to search for marks
on his body. You're sure to find them.

859
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:14,320
Your daughter has good taste.

860
01:23:14,685 --> 01:23:17,193
He's good looking this victim of love.

861
01:23:18,635 --> 01:23:20,196
Tell me by the way...

862
01:23:20,837 --> 01:23:25,007
-Jacques and Elsa? -Yes he was at her
side in the dining room yesterday evening.

863
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:27,004
Don't search further.

864
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,469
You saw your daughter's nails?

865
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:33,625
-I swear they're as tough as
the lepoard-men's. -You hate her.

866
01:23:34,223 --> 01:23:37,751
Not as much as you think. And don't
make me say what I didn't say.

867
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:44,634
Look. It's right in front of you.
You panic for nothing.

868
01:23:45,421 --> 01:23:49,860
-You have to much imagination and you don't see 
the evidence. -You always try to belittle my family.

869
01:23:50,175 --> 01:23:51,888
You know how I appreciate Laurent.

870
01:23:51,968 --> 01:23:54,439
Don't make me believe you don't
have an agenda of your own?

871
01:23:54,548 --> 01:23:56,306
Come on, between us...

872
01:23:56,663 --> 01:24:02,437
I like you Walerian but why turning into
a vaudeville a story which could be wonderful?

873
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:04,857
You're unfair Bob.

874
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:06,461
Very unfair.

875
01:24:06,883 --> 01:24:08,297
To prove you wrong

876
01:24:08,414 --> 01:24:10,077
we're going to scheme

877
01:24:10,325 --> 01:24:14,013
something much more delicious
than a sordid news item.

878
01:24:14,859 --> 01:24:15,997
Look...

879
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:20,298
Wait, wait...I'm going to
wear my big chasuble.

880
01:24:27,107 --> 01:24:29,892
Again? You're too nervous big guy!

881
01:24:30,301 --> 01:24:33,567
You can't throw me away
each time a bird lands on the roof.

882
01:24:34,106 --> 01:24:36,206
A bird...It's a man.

883
01:24:36,381 --> 01:24:39,151
I tell you I don't expect anyone.

884
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,896
You can't see through the
dark. Light the lamp.

885
01:24:51,049 --> 01:24:52,390
No need for a lamp.

886
01:24:52,945 --> 01:24:54,709
The moonlight is gorgeous.

887
01:24:54,943 --> 01:24:56,153
Look carefully.

888
01:24:58,151 --> 01:25:00,119
-I'm looking.
-Nothing?

889
01:25:00,381 --> 01:25:01,402
Nothing.

890
01:25:02,044 --> 01:25:03,312
You're sure?

891
01:25:04,508 --> 01:25:06,972
Sure. There's only the other guy.

892
01:25:08,314 --> 01:25:11,172
The little flying-man.
-He didn't leave.

893
01:25:11,434 --> 01:25:13,738
No. He seems to sleep.

894
01:25:14,496 --> 01:25:16,027
Maybe you killed him.

895
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:17,762
That's bullshit.

896
01:25:18,141 --> 01:25:19,395
Why not?

897
01:25:19,833 --> 01:25:21,436
You're so strong.

898
01:26:34,806 --> 01:26:36,585
Hello Helene. You're happy?

899
01:26:37,488 --> 01:26:39,399
-I'm happy.
-Jacques is not with you?

900
01:26:40,069 --> 01:26:41,454
He left last night.

901
01:26:41,921 --> 01:26:43,700
-You stay?
-I'd like to.

902
01:26:44,502 --> 01:26:46,332
So we'll see each other again.

903
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,052
Without a doubt.

904
01:26:48,395 --> 01:26:50,407
It's good to take a little walk at dawn.

905
01:26:51,574 --> 01:26:54,614
I'm sorry but I have to take this
soldier back to his barrack.

906
01:26:55,802 --> 01:26:58,127
I'm delighted to be able to help you.

907
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:02,203
-See you soon.
-Good day Helene.

908
01:28:14,438 --> 01:28:17,179
-Miss, your lessons!
-Not on a marriage day.

909
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,372
They're wonderful.

910
01:28:20,707 --> 01:28:23,288
-It's the word.
-Mr Lorrain, what a splendid marriage.

911
01:28:24,017 --> 01:28:27,823
We'll have superb photos.
It'll help me to fill my Sunday column.

912
01:28:28,058 --> 01:28:32,870
That and the calcined car
accident at the Pernes gulch.

913
01:29:53,058 --> 01:29:58,870
