Script - Leo Birinski

00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,243
Photography - Scenography 

4
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:33,464
Director 

5
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,510
In "Luna Park" in Hamburg 

6
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,056
Boss, owner of the booth 

7
00:02:12,456 --> 00:02:17,482
The steamer "Berta Maria" docked at the port of Hamburg that evening.  

8
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:32,937
Boss and his companion do a number together.

9
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:06,996
We had a gypsy on board with the company. Everyone left at the last port,  ... 

10
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:09,754
but they abandoned this ... girl. 

11
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:53,264
You say that she dances well? 

12
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:42,913
In this group, we all do, too. 

13
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,368
She stays! 

14
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,646
It has a very strange name. We call our ship the "Berta Maria" 

15
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:37,397
Are not you tired of this monotonous life? 

16
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:42,316
How much better would it be to do our acrobatic act and travel the world

17
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:54,614
I know I'm a burden. I know I try but I fail. 

18
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:22,423
If you're jealous of that girl, tomorrow we will tell her go. 

19
00:09:31,265 --> 00:09:33,613
It looks as if I am.  We're not married. 

20
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:44,775
I will do whatever you want.  

21
00:14:11,437 --> 00:14:12,598
The show is over. 

22
00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:00,927
You've finished! - Do you understand? Completely, forever! 

23
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:40,608
I leave tonight. Will you come with me? 

24
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:09,090
The Berlin Wintergarten.  The new acts program. 

25
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:31,506
The Artinelli Brothers 

26
00:20:44,052 --> 00:20:47,907
Sir: The Artinellis await you in their study. 

27
00:21:04,851 --> 00:21:11,200
Unfortunately I must terminate my contract. My brother is seriously injured. 

28
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:17,204
Klerck: try to obtain a replacement quickly. 

29
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:16,836
I found an excellent number.  Boss is back at the plaza. 

30
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:32,079
Are you kidding? I cannot associate with such a low-class acrobat. 

31
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,669
"... but if you saw .... his companion ... " 

32
00:31:11,142 --> 00:31:15,486
The famous Artinellis want to sign you ... if you made it our debut. We would do the "Wintergarten" 

33
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:10,895
Joining the Artinellis is a good omen.

34
00:36:15,108 --> 00:36:20,010
Not only is he a great artist, but he is also an interesting man. 

35
00:37:15,604 --> 00:37:21,867
Artinelli has invited all the artists to the Wintergarten to celebrate our success. 

36
00:37:37,351 --> 00:37:39,715
A souvenir of our debut 

37
00:40:18,226 --> 00:40:21,043
END OF PART ONE 

38
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:24,087
PART TWO

39
00:40:41,163 --> 00:40:42,459
Artinelli - And where is he? 

40
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:45,669
He is still sleeping 

41
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:44,315
Our success has enabled us to go to America. 

42
00:42:43,142 --> 00:42:45,216
Is this your way of thanking me?

43
00:43:06,592 --> 00:43:12,721
Mine should be ... It was I who has made you successful ... I even took you to the booths at the fairs.

44
00:43:54,308 --> 00:43:57,699
You're as lucky in cards as you are in love. 

45
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:32,222
I am sorry, but tonight I cannot be at the Reunion of the Artist's Circle 

46
00:45:00,122 --> 00:45:03,065
What a pity! I have never seen such a party. 

47
00:45:06,512 --> 00:45:09,432
If Mr. Artinelli wants to accompany you... 

48
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:08,308
I was surprised myself ... at the party in Linderpark ... 

49
00:54:39,102 --> 00:54:43,876
That night, the fabulous trio will perform, on the night of honor, 

50
00:54:43,969 --> 00:54:47,955
The exciting "triple somersault". 

51
01:02:15,118 --> 01:02:18,387
Tell Berta Maria not to be late again tonight. 

52
01:02:18,513 --> 01:02:21,388
I have invited my friends from Hamburg. 

53
01:06:15,962 --> 01:06:17,761
Pick it up and defend yourself! 

54
01:06:54,102 --> 01:06:55,531
I will count to three ... 

55
01:12:21,783 --> 01:12:24,151
Where is the nearest police station?

56
01:14:13,014 --> 01:14:17,536
The mother of your son has made a request to the Ministry of Justice 

57
01:14:17,626 --> 01:14:21,592
and requested that you be pardoned to be with your son

58
01:14:58,737 --> 01:15:02,769
... I do not want my request to be ignored.  You should return to

59
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:06,917
our son, and forget everything that has happened 

60
01:15:07,011 --> 01:15:10,787
Every day he asks for his father.  I tell him he is in a distant land ... 

61
01:16:12,288 --> 01:16:15,497
The pardon has been granted. Make certain that

62
01:16:15,627 --> 01:16:18,406
you are grateful for this

63
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:21,222
generous act. 

64
01:16:34,409 --> 01:16:37,956
END
