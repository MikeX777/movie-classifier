1
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:48,238
Look, I didn't mean it
to be this way.

2
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,909
This— Every— The reasons why
I'm leaving are on this tape.

3
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,918
It points out the 6 points
of why I think

4
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,011
our relationship is doomed
and why I'm leaving it.

5
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:59,085
You can watch it later.
I was gonna mail it

6
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,092
but now-- I'll just
give it to you now.

7
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,025
Are you taking your VCR,
or did you leave that upstairs?

8
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,700
I bought the VCR!
I'm taking my VCR!

9
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,465
I bought—
It's the only thing I'm taking.

10
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,933
What is that on top of the car?

11
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,937
Is that a futon on top of the car?

12
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,200
That's our futon.
That's my futon.

13
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,208
I'm takin' the—
Can I please take the futon?

14
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,209
Please?

15
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,100
-Get in the car!
-Violence is not the answer!

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,210
Don't be drivin' back here
in a couple days, okay?

17
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,481
I'm not going through this
over and over and over.

18
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,284
I'm not…
That's on the tape.

19
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,689
I think that's point
number 4 on the tape

20
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,785
because I have my vision,
you have your vision

21
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:39,160
and I'm leaving, because
the Tantoonis need me.

22
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,700
-The who?
-The Tantoonis.

23
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,900
What is…?

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,200
It's an Indian tribe.
It was in the newspaper.

25
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,261
It was on CNN!
You don't even watch TV.

26
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,600
You don't read the paper.
You don't know what's going on in the world!

27
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,741
That's one of my reasons.
That's point 1!

28
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:54,600
-You can't just walk out, Sean.
-Listen, listen.

29
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,100
I'm gonna go,
and I'm not coming back.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,685
-Take Fidel.
-Please take Fidel.

31
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,279
I'm not taking Fidel, Sean.
I'm not taking your fucking cat!

32
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,358
I don't have the time and
energy to take care of the cat.

33
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,359
I have to go and get
something accomplished.

34
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,953
That cat would be in the way—
Ow! I am a man of peace!

35
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,499
You are a woman of violence.
I'm not a man like that.

36
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,570
And you're turning me into that man.
That's like point number 8. I don't know.

37
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,834
-Hi. Good night.
-Good night, Erin. Have a good night.

38
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,338
<i>Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor</i>
<i>in the main lobby.</i>

39
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,034
<i>Dr. Kravitz, a visitor</i>
<i>in the main lobby.</i>

40
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:35,200
Do you guys know Bob, that
security guard from the lobby?

41
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,513
-He's really something, huh?
-Yeah.

42
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,560
He asked me to go to this little soiree
with him on Saturday to the aquarium,

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,960
'cause that's where
he used to work,

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,160
and then yesterday he drops,

45
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,289
like he mentions that
Rick hit on him last summer.

46
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh, he didn't say that!
I only flirted.

47
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,067
It was his uniform.
I couldn't resist!

48
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,860
I know, but the thing is

49
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,260
that he said some really
mean and nasty things about you.

50
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,300
They made me feel
really bad.

51
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,534
All right,
so he's a homophobic prick.

52
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,134
So what else is new?
Story of my life.

53
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,578
I already said yes,
that I would go.

54
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,100
-You left me the witches' costume?
-Honey, it's you!

55
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,400
Thank you very much.
I really appreciate it.

56
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,900
You're confused, honey.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,581
What would you do
if you were me, Erin?

58
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,590
Well, you want to get out of it?

59
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,592
Yeah.

60
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,960
Tell Bob
that you're meeting

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,932
a friend and her "date"
at the party.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,360
And then, when her date
doesn't show up,

63
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,660
she gets really upset,
she wants to leave,

64
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,160
you need to take her home
and then you're out.

65
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,743
That's it. It's really simple.
Men are really easy to trick.

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,000
Or treat, you witch.

67
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,900
That's perfect! I need a friend, though
and I have no friends so

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,060
Erin, will you please go with me
and be my friend?

69
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,060
No. I hate parties.

70
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,900
You always have a reason.
Please come with me.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,115
Oh, Erin, you have just got to go!

72
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,700
I mean, what man could resist
the wicked witch of the west wing?

73
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,760
Listen, my mother
is in town this weekend.

74
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
I don't have any time.
I have to be with her.

75
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,900
Yeah, okay, well.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,760
Wait a minute. My mother
is in town this weekend.

77
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,535
Yeah, I'll go.

78
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,600
Oh, thank you!

79
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,000
Trick or treat!

80
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,280
Mama! Mama!

81
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,789
Oh, oh, honey!

82
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,554
Mama!

83
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,392
-I want my daddy!
-Mama!

84
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,932
Daddy!

85
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,300
I found it.

86
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,300
-You haven't got much Wordsworth, have you?
-No.

87
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll let you have that one half price.

88
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh, shoot!

89
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,600
-Got it?
-Yep.

90
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,800
There you go.
No, no. Don't close it.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,960
You should never close a book
until you've read something from it.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,700
What?

93
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,412
Just a sentence or a word.
It can be very, very revealing.

94
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,287
Just read something, anything.
Read from the top, then.

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,760
"When from our better selves
we have too long Been parted

96
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,460
by the hurrying world,
and droop,

97
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,860
Sick of its business,
of its pleasures tired,

98
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,500
How gracious,
how benign is Solitude"

99
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:47,960
Hi, it's Mom. I fly in
at 9:30 tomorrow morning

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,974
so I'll see you at the gate.

101
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,375
Hope we can have a little fun tomorrow
night. Kick up our heels or something?

102

Hey, you guys? Who is this?

116
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:38,008
That is… Fred Astaire?

117
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,017
No, no, no. This is Burgess Meredith.

118
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,953
Remember? I was telling you this yesterday.
You have to recognize that marking there.

119
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,990
-By his neck.
-I knew it.

120
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,992
Oh, he escaped from the tray
again last night.

121
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,358
Oh, don't worry about it. That's okay.
I mean, they always escape.

122
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,363
-Hey, Ben.
-How you doin'?

123
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,700
Yuri needs you for a second down in pumps.
He has another pipe leak.

124
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,601
I can't, Ben.
I'm diving in two minutes.

125
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,700
It's a two-minute job.
For you, anyway.

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,373
Did you have a chance to go over the
Assistant Aquarist application I put in?

127
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,400
Okay, nothing's been decided.
But you're still on the running.

128
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,378
All right. Thanks, Ben.

129
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,508
<i>The dolphin</i>
<i>show begins in…</i>

130
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,644
Ahh, good!

131
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:19,088
I'm a volunteer diver,
not volunteer plumber, Yuri.

132
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,591
This is the last time I'm comin'
down and doin' you a favor, all right?

133
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:25,460
I'm not getting paid for this. I don't want
to be down here helping you. No moreski.

134
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,658
I do. I do you favor.

135
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:31,168
Yuri, first of all, what's this?
You have half a gasket in here.

136
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,795
Where's the other half
of the gasket?

137
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,306
<i>Bye!</i>

138
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,878
So, that isn't a problem.
Just fax it to the hotel.

139
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:27,086
I'll sign it, and then
I'll fax it back. All right.

140
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:31,254
Now, darling, you weren't there.

141
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,265
-And this gentleman…
-I was here, Mom. Your plane was early.

142
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,160
Well, whatever.
I didn't see you,

143
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,560
and I thought
you weren't gonna make it

144
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,360
so this very lovely man offered me a ride
and so I took it and I'm sorry

145
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,874
-but I did leave you a message on the machine.
-Okay, forget about it.

146
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,877
It gave me some time to walk around.
I went to the aquarium.

147
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,779
Wait a minute. Hold on.
Let me make it up to you.

148
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,078
My latest acquisition.
What do you think?

149
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,300
Blinding teeth.

150
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,683
-Well, he's available.
-What?

151
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,691
-They're not all gay, you know.
-Piper!

152
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,658
Darling!

153
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,889
-Oh, hi!
-Oh, my God!

154
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:09,300
-It's so good to see you!
-I have never, ever seen you in red.

155
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,029
What has happened?

156
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,800
Oh, this isn't red.
This is Hollywood black.

157
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,300
You look great.

158
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,400
And this—look at this—
this is my latest find.

159
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,738
He is going to be the
biggest thing ever.

160
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,815
-Isn't he big now?
-Oh, yes, you know, he is.

161
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,300
-It pays the tuition.
-Tuition?

162
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,200
-I'm in med school.
-Really?

163
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,600
My daughter went to medical
school. Yes, Harvard.

164
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,100
-Harvard.
-Yes. She didn't want to continue.

165
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,728
I didn't finish.

166
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,957
She didn't finish because it
was her choice not to finish.

167
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,967
She had the highest grade point
average of any female at Harvard.

168
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,264
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, she did.

169
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,271
-No. No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

170
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,273
-Piper.
-I did not!

171
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:54,642
-So, what are you doing now?
-I'm a phlebotomist.

172
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,113
You study insects?

173
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,060
She is not a phlebotomist.
She is a registered nurse,

174
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,213
a profession her late father
esteemed very highly.

175
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,348
And she's a very good one.

176
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,257
-I'll see you later.
-It's inevitable to see you later.

177
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,386
Bye-bye, Rory.
Good luck to you.

178
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,829
He'll need it.

179
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,800
So, how's the old place?

180
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,200
It's quiet.

181
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,700
Renovations?

182
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,700
We never finished.

183
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,907
Have you really been by
yourself ever since that…

184
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,141
that Marxist left?

185
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,242
-He was an activist, Mother.
-Well, it's the same thing.

186
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,844
I must say I was delighted when I heard
you gave him his walking papers.

187
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,720
Sean left me, Mom.

188
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,886
No. And you let him?

189
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,827
Did I have a choice?

190
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,399
Dear, sweetness,

191
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,401
light of my life,

192
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,199
with men, you always have a choice.

193
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,205
Well, you didn't.

194
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,660
I am sorry, Mom.
I don't know why I said that.

195
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,620
-It's okay.
-There's no comparison.

196
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,782
You're right.

197
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,350
Loss is loss.
It's the same thing, either way.

198
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,056
You know what I think
your father would have wanted?

199
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:23,397
I think he would want you
to move on,

200
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:27,300
find yourself a new man
and be happy again.

201
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
I am happy.

202
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,034
Well, there's no crime
in showing it, is there?

203
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,306
Look, Mom. I know that you
don't think that a woman

204
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:38,440
-can be alone and be content.
-What are you talking about?

205
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,815
This is me you're talking to.
Of course, I do.

206
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,600
Oh, come on.
You are never alone.

207
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,255
You're always surrounded
by all these people.

208
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,020
Listen, what are we going
to do tonight?

209
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,897
I had an idea. Thought maybe
Dodge and I would come over

210
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,400
to the old apartment
and have some cocktails—

211
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,400
Dodge?

212
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,000
-Dodge!
-Who is Dodge?

213
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,303
The gentleman I met
at the airport. I told you this!

214
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,934
-You never listen to me!
-His name is Dodge?

215
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,445
His name is Dodge and we thought
we'd take you out tonight.

216
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
I have a date.

217
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,900
Anyway Dodge and I thought
that we would have some drinks—

218
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,781
-What?
-I have a date.

219
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:18,015
You have a date! Goddamn you.

220
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,115
What have I been carrying
on about? Who with?

221
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,752
Who is it with? Come on.

222
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,162
A girl from work.

223
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,296
This is Wonderland Station

224
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,805
in the Wonderland commuter parking lot.

225
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,934
A quarter-pound of pecorino, please.

226
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,171
The price of cheese.

227
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,148
<i>Reporter Arnie Reisman has</i>
<i>been following that story.</i>

228
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,151
<i>It's only the latest in a series</i>

229
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:51,280
<i>of anonymous acts of vandalism that began</i>
<i>last month during the Boston Aquarium's</i>

230
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,960
<i>prolonged legal battle</i>
<i>with Lesser Construction.</i>

231
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,960
<i>Yesterday, Lesser Construction</i>
<i>lost its bid to build</i>

232
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,560
<i>a state-of-the-art mausoleum</i>
<i>on this waterfront lot,</i>

233
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,100
<i>now officially, future home of</i>
<i>the aquarium's North Addition.</i>

234
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,734
<i>I want to congratulate</i>
<i>Miss Shebola and the aquarium</i>

235
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,760
<i>for getting the approval</i>
<i>for their Addition.</i>

236
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,836
<i>Now, the good people of Boston will</i>
<i>have a place to cavort with fish</i>

237
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,939
<i>instead of a place to</i>
<i>properly, hygienically,</i>

238
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,950
<i>not to mention economically,</i>
<i>bury their loved ones.</i>

239
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,987

00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,988
<i>into any kind</i>
<i>of financial distress.</i>

241
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,581
<i>We're now in the business</i>
<i>of building privately run,</i>

242
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,684
<i>for-profit,</i>
<i>commercial prisons.</i>

243
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,695
<i>There's no need to tell</i>
<i>you how successful they are.</i>

244
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,698
<i>What about the allegations that</i>
<i>you're behind the aquarium vandalism?</i>

245
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,700
<i>That is very… I've heard.</i>
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

246
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,965
<i>I love fish. They're good creatures.</i>
<i>I've nothing against them.</i>

247
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:43,041
<i>Are you worried that you're going to wind</i>
<i>up in the same prison you're building?</i>

248
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,076
-<i>Is that funny?</i>
-<i>That's enough!</i>

249
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,239
-You're actin'like an idiot!
-Stupid!

250
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,250
I am not acting like an idiot!

251
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,252
No, you're not actin'like an idiot.

252
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,914
-You just don't fuckin' listen!
-Who do you think you are, leavin' here?

253
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,923
-You're acting like--
-Take it easy!

254
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,660
Hey, hey, hey,
cut, cut, cut!

255
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,700
Will you guys please shut up?
What is the matter with you?

256
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,700
We had an argument, all right?
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,700
Try to keep it down.

258
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,160
Will you please
try and keep it down?

259
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,200
He is trying to study, all right?
Have a little respect.

260
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,660
Who cares what other
fuckin' people say?

261
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,537
You moron!

262
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,273
-I'm not an idiot, you are!
-Man!

263
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,458
<i>…their continued support</i>
<i>for the protesters</i>

264
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,627
<i>said they now prefer to</i>
<i>negotiate with developers.</i>

265
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:48,833
-<i>This is Renita Harrow, BSN News.</i>
-<i>I don't give a damn!</i>

266
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,744
And it is with pride that I pronounce

267
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,805
that when construction finishes
on the North Addition in 1999

268
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,282
Boston will again have

269
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:04,516
the nation's premiere public aquarium.

270
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,660
Let us christen
this voyage tonight,

271
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:17,163
leave the port, move forward,
put the bad water behind us.

272
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,460
On behalf of myself and Puff,
our little fish mascot…

273
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,900
-Frankie, get me a drink.
-You got it, Arty.

274
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,612
…enjoy the festivities.
Thank you.

275
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:50,495
So, what kind of an idiot
would blow off a woman like you?

276
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,960
He's a bastard.

277
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,500
Let me tell you
something about this guy.

278
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,000
He's a little acey-deucey.

279
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,060
You know what I mean.

280
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,151
No straight guy in his right mind
would blow off a woman like you.

281
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,811
Yeah, well, I guess
it wasn't meant to be.

282
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,260
I don't know.
I think I'm gonna go home.

283
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,800
No, wait.

284
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,000
What do you say
I go with you?

285
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,039
You're alone, I'm security.

286
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,019
I mean, she and I,
we're not even involved.

287
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,060
As far as I'm concerned, Bob,
there is no security.

288
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,381
Only security guards.

289
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,249
Hey! Hello. Hey, Erin.

290
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:46,154
-Could I just have a minute?
-Certainly. Certainly.

291
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,900
See you, Bob.

292
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,423
Okay, all right.
Are we done? Can we go now?

293
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,296
Are you done?
Can you go?

294
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,699
Wait a minute. I thought that the
whole point was that I would be here--

295
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,704
Right. But now
the point seems to be

296
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,604
that you are really
preoccupied with my date.

297
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,609
Oh, I'm preoccupied with Bob.

298
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,576
Hey! We havin' a good time?

299
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,739
Cricket, what do you say
we dance, right now?

300
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,443
-I'd love to.
-Great!

301
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,554
-Alan! Alan!
-Yeah?

302
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:27,400
Bob? Bob? Remember?

303
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,900
Bob, how are you?

304
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,725
This is Cricket.
Cricket, Alan. Alan, Cricket.

305
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,929
-How are you?
-Hi.

306
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,733
Cricket's a nurse
where I work now.

307
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,740
Over at the hospital.

308
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,471
Hey, we could have used you here last week
what with the shenanigans and everything.

309
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,843
A guy like Bob,
back in the saddle again, huh, Bob?

310
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,439
If I were still here,
that shit would never happen.

311
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,244
-Good seeing you.
-Alan.

312
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,482
-You here alone?
-Yes, I am.

313
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,559
I got a chick
you're not gonna believe.

314
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,120
A hot chick, free thinker, rubbin' against
the furniture right now, all by her lonesome.

315
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,791
She's trawlin'for action,
beggin'for somethin'

316
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,061
and I think you are the kind
of guy that can give it to her.

317
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,433
Well, you know, Bob. I'm really
quite flattered that you'd think of me

318
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,506
but to tell you the truth,
I'm real busy at the moment.

319
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,075
-So, I'll see you later.
-Wait a minute.

320
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:14,634
-What are you, some kind of fag?
-Alan!

321
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:18,443
Yo, Alan! How are ya?

322
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,542
-Oh, shit.
-I'll meet you at the bar!

323
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:26,989
-Great to see you again, Bob.
-Good to see ya.

324
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,992
Where ya been, buddy?

325
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:33,394
Hey, I'm gettin' the feeling
you're trying to avoid me.

326
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,360
No, no, no.
I'm not avoiding you, Frank.

327
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,469
I'm just very busy, you know.
I've got classes. I'm volunteering here…

328
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,260
-I got a little favor I gotta ask ya.
-Oh, Christ, Frank.

329
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,104
If this is about your toilet,
I can't come by every time.

330
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,110
No. It's flushin' like a champ
since you've been in there.

331
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:51,114
Listen, maybe you can take me
on a little tour.

332
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:54,276
-You want a little tour, Frank?
-Yeah.

333
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,719
You can show me that little Poof
fish that's on the news all the time.

334
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:01,350
Puff, Frank. It's a puffer
fish, all right? Come on.

335
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,860
<i>When threatened,</i>
<i>a balloonfish can rapidly</i>

336
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,056
<i>inflate its body</i>
<i>with water or air.</i>

337
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:09,691
Frank, do you see where it says,
"Do not tap on the glass"?

338
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,769
All right?
These are very sensitive fish.

339
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,360
-They got feelings?
-Yeah, they do, Frank.

340
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,260
You know what? You're really
not supposed to smoke here,

341
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,960
so why don't we go back
where we came from

342
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,534
and I'll just see you in a couple days
and I'll give you some money, all right?

343
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,012
You were doing just fine
when you were plumbing, Al.

344
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,607
When you were workin' with your
father, when you were a team.

345
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:30,711
Look, Frank, you did me a really
big favor by lending me the money

346
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,620
so I could go to school,
but I'm a full-time student now

347
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,590
and it's just gonna take me
a little more time.

348
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,560
I can't give you
any more time.

349
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,460
Christ, Frank.
What do you expect me to do?

350
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,700
I don't have any money.

351
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,766
Small favor. Do it, and I'll knock off
the interest on the loan.

352
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,931
<i>…the North Addition, coming in 1999.</i>

353
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,703
Certain people just want
a message sent, that's all.

354
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,779
So what is this
"favor"?

355
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,389
Just eliminate the fish,
that's it.

356
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,223
-Puff?
-Yeah, Puff!

357
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,700
What, are you kidding me, Frank?
There's no way!

358
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,660
Oh, for Christ's sake!

359
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,200
It's a goddamn, pansy-ass fish!
Look at it!

360
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,735
Ladies.

361
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,306
You know, Frank, I can't believe
that you're asking me to do this!

362
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,740
I'm not gonna do it!
But don't worry—you know what?—

363
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,300
'cause I will definitely
get you your money, one way or the other.

364
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,639
Next Monday I will see you,
I will have your money

365
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:32,979
plus your three points, all right?

366
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,660
Hey, Alan.

367
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,455
Who's gonna loan you the money,
your father?

368
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:42,152
He's at the dog track,
blowin' the two grand
I fronted him last week.

369
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,160
<i>…biologists call it</i>
<i>a defense mechanism</i>

370
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:49,598
<i>because it defends the fish against</i>
<i>attacks by hungry predators, like sharks.</i>

371
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:59,300
Smile! Hey, looks like you
just made the society page!

372
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,437
What's your name, gorgeous?

373
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,747
<i>Hi, this is Erin.</i>
<i>Please, leave a message after the beep.</i>

374
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,618
Hi, doll. I've got some
interesting news for you.

375
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:15,523
Okay, now. If you look
in this week's Herald…

376
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,994
Hi, sweetie, it's me. I'm in London.

377
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,000
-I just picked up a copy of the Herald.
-Yeah, I know. I saw it.

378
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,100
What do you mean you saw it?
Who spoiled it for you?

379
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,200
What are you talking about?
Wait a minute.

380
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,160
Why do you have the Herald?
Aren't you in London?

381
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,500
If you'll just look at page 67,
I'll be able to tell you.

382
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,715
Wait. These are
the personal ads.

383
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:41,252
Just look, in the middle
of the second column,

384
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:45,187
right between "Vivacious Vixen"
and "Wasting Away".

385
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:50,183
"Waiting For You"
"Do you believe in destiny? I do"

386
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:54,425
"Be part of mine"
"Me: 29, five foot six"

387
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:58,264
"Brains, beauty, body, all in one"

388
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,864
"Frisky, cultured and carefree
professional with zest for life"

389
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:06,273
"Number one in fun!
You: Sophisticated, smart

390
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:09,040
and sumptuous success story
who will make me smile"

391
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,947
"Us: soul mates seeking
spontaneous combustion?"

392
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:16,179
"Pervs or drunks need not apply"?

393
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,950
Darling, you sound so excited!
I'm very happy!

394
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,786
You put in a personal ad for me?

395
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:24,123
I admit I did have
a little help from my publicist.

396
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,629
-Oh, my God.
-Darling, look.

397
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,825
If you're not going to help yourself,
I feel, as your mother,

398
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,100
that I have the right
to help you if I can.

399
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,700
As my mother?
As my pimp is more like it.

400
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,367
Look, sweetie,
it's only an option.

401
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,460
You can access your messages
by dialing a four-digit code.

402
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,938
I gave you your birthday, 1966.

403
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,960
You know, Ma,
I would never do this. Never!

404
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,488
And who is this person?
"Frisky, carefree, with a zest for…"

405
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,922
Oh, this is you.
Isn't it, Mom?

406
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:01,931
-This is you.
-No, sweetie, it is not me. It is you.

407
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:06,561
It is the you I remember,
the sweet, darling, happy you

408
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,764
that you used
to be before…

409
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:17,272
I'm sorry.

410
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,476
I've got to get ready
to go to work.

411
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,485
I know.

412
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:27,183
Listen. I just wanted to remind you,
actually, about Thanksgiving in Manhattan.

413
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,920
I won't forget about Thanksgiving, Mom.
I'll be there.

414
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,258
Feel free to bring a new friend
if you like.

415
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,301
Yes. Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
The angler fish.

416
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:40,303
This is the female, by the way.
My apologies, ladies.

417
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,771
Nature can be cruel.

418
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,274
Can anyone tell me,
out of interest,

419
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,813
why the male is so humbly displayed?

420
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,815
Come on, people. Wake up! Someone!

421
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,943
Someone other than Alan.
Anybody but Alan.

422
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,487
Okay, Alan.

423
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:01,355
-The Ceratadeam…
-Ceratoidea.

424
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:04,724
Ceratoidea has evolved
so that the male is always

425
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:07,798
right there with the female,
ready to inject it with the sperm.

426
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:11,699
It's what you would call
a "symbiotic relationship".

427
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:15,534
Thank you, Alan. Another
amazingly accurate answer.

428
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,803
Moving on, next snapshot,
if you would.

429
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,900
Ah! The Coelacanth.

430
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,860
The Coelacanth is known to be

431
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,780
one of the most elusive
of the deep-sea creatures.

432
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,960
Julie, come here.

433
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,600
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I stand corrected.

434
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,855
This is probably the most elusive
of the sea creatures.

435
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:37,190
And by "sea", I mean C
or maybe D or most probably F.

436
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,354
-Sit down.
-Sorry.

437
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,490
I'd like to see you
in the office a little later.

438
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,500
You're the only one
who takes notes in that class, Alan.

439
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,600
Everybody takes notes.

440
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,060
They have notebooks,
and you have a…

441
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,900
You know, you're a tutor and you should
be making sure I do things like that.

442
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,700
Wait a minute.
Julie, I'm not your tutor.

443
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,700
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

444
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,000
I hired you.

445
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,660
No, you didn't hire me.
I'm just a friend.

446
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,400
You make it sound like
I'm some old man or something.

447
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,900
Well, you gotta help me, then.

448
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,200
I'll give you my notes, all right?

449
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,660
Make copies of them
and definitely copy--

450
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,146
Let's go to the study hall now
and then you can…

451
00:27:06,186 --> 00:27:08,392
-No, no, tell you what.
-…catch me up a little.

452
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,287
You take the notebook.
Give it back to me tomorrow.

453
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:12,060
I gotta go see Ray
about my paper.

454
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,100
You're such a pill!

455
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,760
What're you talking about?
I'm not a pill.

456
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,360
I like a good time
as much as the next guy.

457
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,563
I'm just not the next guy.
I'll see you later.

458
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,060
<i>Good morning, Boston! 20 minutes past the hour…</i>

459
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,841
Rick, you are definitely water.

460
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,310
Olly, I know you're fire, all right?

461
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,313
So, how did you two meet?

462
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,315
-Well, all right.
-No, no, no, no. I'll tell the story.

463
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,317
-Let me--
-No, 'cause you always lie.

464
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,480
-I don't lie. I embellish.
-Make it juicy. Just tell me!

465
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,220
Well, it was about four years ago.
I was out on the duck tour, you know?

466
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,405
Oh, yeah.

467
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:45,523
You know, the amphibious thing
that goes in the water?

468
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,064
-Can I tell the story?
-Yes, sure. I'm embellishing.

469
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,033
-I get seasick really easily.
-We were still on Newbury Street.

470
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,161
We weren't even out of the
harbor yet. He's seasick.

471
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,304
I was on the side.
Basically, I was getting sick.

472
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,744
Oh, but as a nurse
I'm used to that kind of thing

473
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,747
-and I took right over, didn't I?
-He did.

474
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,260
And I was very professional.

475
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,450
And, I consider myself, now
the luckiest nurse in all of Boston.

476
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,523
Except, of course, for you, Erin.

477
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,000
Erin, this is a great shot.

478
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,900
Correction, my dear.
That is not luck. That is fate.

479
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,600
-Fate is bullshit.
-I don't believe in fate.

480
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,563
What?

481
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:24,863
What, like there's some unseen hand
leading you down the garden path?

482
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:26,869
-Exactly.
-I wish. I'm sorry, I don't believe it.

483
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:29,804
-It isn't necessarily unseen--
-Unseen hands can be fun!

484
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:32,960
I totally believe in fate.
I mean, like, for instance,

485
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,760
if Erin hadn't been
at the aquarium party the other night

486
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,100
I never would have realized
how much I wanted Bob.

487
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,950
-Ta-da!
-Who's Bob?

488
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,612
-This guy that I'm dating.
-Case in point.

489
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,960
-You know, I heard he quit.
-No, Bob was fired, actually.

490
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,723
He was demonstrating
how to load his gun

491
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,888
in the commissary
to a small child.

492
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:56,194
Yeah. That was a total setup.

493
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:59,065
I don't know, Erin. You have
to believe in something, right?

494
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:03,334
-It makes life more fun.
-That's right! And Erin is the fun girl.

495
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:06,569
-Fun, fun, fun.
-Yes. All of Boston society knows it now.

496
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,578
You look great.

497
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,807
All right, all right.
Here's one, here's one. Ready?

498
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:15,352
"I am a divergent thinker with a
sharp wit, but a reflective soul."

499
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:21,400
"I value quiet reads, sublime sunsets, humor, tenderness and balance."

500
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,359
That's not a personal ad!
That's a fuckin' daily affirmation!

501
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,362
I'll find you a personal ad.

502
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,694
Alan, are you in?

503
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,700
What are you talkin' about? In what?

504
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:34,704
Oh, it's a bet. We're all gonna
reply to the same personal ad.

505
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,706
We go out with the chick.

506
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,174
First guy who scores gets 200 bucks from the two losers.

507
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,177
-Right on.
-Or three.

508
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,500
So I guess Traci's what, history?

509
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,445
No, I ain't got time for a townie.
I mean, no offense, bro.

510
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,849
None taken, bro.

511
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,751
-What do you say? You in or…
-Okay, so what do you have to do to win?

512
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:55,019
Well, we agreed on it.
It's gotta be a French kiss.

513
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,892
That's tongues,
intermingling consensually, right?

514
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:02,262
-Unforced. That means you, all right?
-Yeah, unforced.

515
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,927
Just out of curiosity,
hold on a second.

516
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:08,301
How will the two losers know
that the winner actually won?

517
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,306
-We watch it.
-Right.

518
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:13,309
-We'll be there.
-Incognito.
Yeah. We'll be in disguise.

519
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,141
-It's gonna be great. Are you gonna be in or what?
-Well, no. Are you kiddin'?

520
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:19,011
That's, like, the stupidest
thing I've heard in my life.

521
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:22,348
Of course I'm not in. Maybe it's
just when you get to be my age.

522
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:26,856
I realize that I can only be who I am.
I can't present myself in any different way.

523
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,756
I don't wanna meet somebody who
presents herself in a different way

524
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,455
because then you have two people that
are basically lying, gettin' together

525
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,464
talkin' a bunch of crap, you know?

526
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,966
I know this firsthand, because
what I've been tryin'to do

527
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:41,471
is to change my destiny and not just
spend the rest of my life being a plumber.

528
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,201
Not that there's anything wrong with
plumbing, but it gives me a freedom.

529
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,573
I can pursue the thing I really love.

530
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,511
How do you find what you love?

531
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:53,516
-Well, I think…
-I'm kidding.

532
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,520
Oh, man!

533
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:01,114
Things are getting like…
Jesus, what are we?
A bunch of chicks or something?

534
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:04,684
-Bob's probably my soul mate.
-I believe that. I totally believe that.

535
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,094
-How could you say that?
-I dearly hope that Bob is not your soul mate.

536
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,859
Look, look. It's not about Bob.

537
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,698
It's about whether or not there's
meaning and direction in our lives.

538
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,700
-I suggested that--
-Well, there isn't!

539
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,706
What do you mean,
"There isn't"?

540
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,006
I'm not saying there's not meaning,
but there's no direction, you know?

541
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,840
Case in point, my parents.
They met on an airplane.

542
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,581
They were flying back from Paris.

543
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:29,482
The only reason my mother was on the flight--
she was supposed to be on an earlier flight

544
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:34,024
but on the way to the airport
her taxi struck and killed a little dog

545
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:37,492
who was chasing a little furry squirrel
and she was delayed.

546
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,495
That's a totally random act,
you know?

547
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:43,556
-That's why she met my father.
-No, Erin, that is fate.

548
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,898
-Oh, come on.
-Tell that to the dog.

549
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,860
-Yes, tell that to the dog.
-No, no, I'm serious!

550
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,100
You don't want to be a plumber, Alan.

551
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,400
The point is I don't wanna be a plumber

552
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,500
but I got nothin' against my father,
I got nothin' against my grandfather.

553
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,400
He's doin' what he wants to do.
I'm tryin' to do what I want to do.

554
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,400
And What are you doing?
You're gonna be a marine biologist?

555
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,400
I'll tell you something.
I don't know from marine biology.

556
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,100
But I don't see any money in it.
I mean, plumbing, money.

557
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,900
And you're still
workin' with water.

558
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,400
I got nothing against being a plumber.

559
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,800
Someone asks me what I do,
and that's what I'm doing, I'm a plumber.

560
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,600
I mean, it's not about
being a plumber.

561
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,400
What does Dad think about you
not wanting to be a plumber?

562
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,500
You know what? I'm gonna go up to the bar
and buy a round of drinks

563
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,600
to celebrate my brother
moving to the South End.

564
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,200
You don't have a problem with a
drink from an eastie, do you, Kev?

565
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,400
Sure.

566
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,987
Man. What's the matter
with your brother?

567
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,527
He's got his head in
the books, every night.

568
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,597
I Mean, he's studying
and studying and studying.

569
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,598
We never studied that hard
and it never hurt us.

570
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,466
"Consistency is the hobgoblin
of little minds."

571
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,806
Yeah! Yeah.

572
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,808
-Consistency.
-Of course.

573
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,243
"Is the hobgoblin of little minds."

574
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,000
-Harry! What's happening?
-Hey, how are you, pal?

575
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,100
Funny you should stop by.

576
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,660
You know who was in
this morning lookin' for you?

577
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,100
-Who?
-Frankie.

578
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,400
What?

579
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,600
You know, Frankie the collector.
Frankie! We all know Frankie.

580
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,700
What can I get you, my friend?

581
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,831
-Three Sam Adams and a ginger ale.
-You got it.

582
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:30,773
So, what's an attractive girl like you
doing in a bar so early?

583
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:35,277
Lookin' for fun, maybe?

584
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,575
What's that on your nose?

585
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,742
You know, the purple blemish
on the end of your nose?

586
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,150
Looks like a basal cell nevus
or maybe a melanoma?

587
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:46,018
You know, you may want
to get that checked.

588
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:51,118
For a man your age a malignant melanoma
could be fatal if not promptly removed.

589
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:56,528
"Me: 29, five six.

590
00:33:56,634 --> 00:34:01,333
-Brains, beauty, body. All in one.
-That's nice.

591
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:05,170
Frisky, cultured and carefree
professional with zest for life.

592
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,642
-Number One in fun."
-"Number One", that's good.

593
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,475
"Pervs or drunks
need not apply."

594
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:13,516
-That's you two.
-That's funny!

595
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:16,644
Look, we fake it
just like she is.

596
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,960
Gentlemen, believe me,

597
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,554
the fact of the matter is
this woman's not what she seems.

598
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:23,058
If she's a beauty, I'm a perv, okay?

599
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:27,564
-Oh, shit! C'mon, man!
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

600
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,929
-What's goin'on? You all right?
-I'm fine.

601
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:33,629
Just spilled some water.
I got it. I got it.

602
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,138
Okay, sugar. You have a good one.

603
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,800
-Will you wake me up when you get in?
-Yep.

604
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,901
-Bye, Oliver.
-See you!

605
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,378
-That's so sweet!
-Olly is so wonderful.

606
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:47,417
I love how you two met.
I mean, he is so Sag.

607
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,317
Olly would hate me
for telling you this

608
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,688
but I can't resist.

609
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,600
We actually met
through a gay dating service.

610
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,000
What?

611
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,900
Manhunters on the
"Meat Market" bulletin board.

612
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,200
You call in a description,
like "Tenderloin" "Butt"…

613
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,500
No, I'm kidding.
But it was through a gay dating service.

614
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,900
But what about the mystery?

615
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,100
Oh, honey, it does not matter
how you meet Mr. or Ms. Right.

616
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,700
I will tell you what
the real mystery is.

617
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,000
The real mystery is:

618
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,700
What keeps two people
together after they meet?

619
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,689
Okay.

620
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,434
You have no new messages.

621
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:42,028
End of messages.
You have no new messages.

622
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:47,009
End of messages.
You have no new messages.

623
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:49,011
End of messages.

624
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:52,048
Hi, Erin. Just want to be clear.

625
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,584
This is very important.
I know I've left before.

626
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:59,987
I know I've come back with my tail
between my legs and cowered and such.

627
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:04,118
I'm not gonna do that again.
I'm leaving. This is it. I'm fed up.

628
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,794
I don't want to fight with you anymore, and
the reasons are what I'm listing right now.

629
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,265
That's 4 or 5. I can't remember.

630
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:15,465
First off,is, uh,you've never
come with me once to my rallies.

631
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:19,134
The reason why you don't want
to come to my rallies is that

632
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:22,212
you do not like the
masses, crowds, whatever.

633
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,838
What do you have against the
masses, is what I want to know?

634
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:28,407
I am in the mass. I am
a member of the crowd.

635
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,111
<i>No new messages. End of messages.</i>

636
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,781
…workers, Erin, is the
only way we as a people

637
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,358
in this country, we as a people
in this society, will move…

638

<i>End of messages.</i>
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

639

<i>You have no new</i>
<i>messages. End of messages.</i>

640
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,697
Say this was a rally,
our relationship, and I showed up to it.

641
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:50,205
No matter how many signs, how many slogans,
how many things I'm chained to.

642
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:53,937
I cannot, somehow,
change our relationship.

643
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:54,860
I can't change you.

644
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,872
I really have to say I wonder
if any man really ever could.

00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,867
Hi there. This is, Bob calling.

654
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,599
Hi, I'm Daryl.

655
00:37:56,707 --> 00:38:00,939
My name is Elliott, and I
am an insurance adjuster.

656
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,100
Hi!

657
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Hey, how you doin', toots? It's me, Joey.

658
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:08,247
Anyway, let me tell you
a little bit about myself.

659
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,378
I'm active. I'm energetic. I'm outgoing.

660
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,787
Forty-si--
Actually, 43 years old.

661
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:16,086
I have slightly thinning hair.

662
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,888
None on my back.
I have no back hair.

663
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:21,226
I'd say five nine,
five nine and a half.

664
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,197
Give or take a--
Let's just say around six feet.

665
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,700
Let me tell you about what I do.
I'm…

666
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,630
…a very successful 30-year-old attorney.

667
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:32,641
I decided to go back to school, actually,
and get a graduate degree in divinity.

668
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,074
I'm a Vietnam-era vet.

669
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:37,147
I'm a temp. But that's not,
like, a permanent thing.

670
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:41,309
I own my own business.

671
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,319
I'm calling you
from the office right now.

672
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,618
-My interests are…
-I like women a lot.

673
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:49,215
I was brought up Catholic, but we
can go into that when I meet you.

674
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,600
I like to do pull-ups
and occasionally I will do a squat thrust.

675
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,625
I think that probably we would
have a lot in common, because…

676
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:01,796
Come on!
I get along well with people.

677
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:06,605
I actually just finalized my divorce
about four days ago.

678
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:11,774
I have to admit
I've got some betrayal issues.

679
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:16,979
I'm looking for a woman
who is tall, yet clean.

680
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:21,582
Someone that likes their mother
and hopefully likes my mother.

681
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:25,150
Reading your ad made me feel like
we were soul mates, I thought.

682
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:28,600
If you could hold on, I have
a fax coming in now. I…

683
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,000
<i>Beep</i>

684
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:35,536
-My number's 5 5 5
-9536. And… over and out.

685
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,000
That was great.

686
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,500
-You know what?
-What?

687
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,260
You might as well
give me the check right now.

688
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,800
You don't have a chance in hell.

689
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,218
Hey! Alan!

690
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,219
Nice computer.

691
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,385
Here's your 135 bucks, Frank.

692
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,019
Just like usual.
You wanna count it?

693
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,792
Hey, what the hell
happened to your nose?

694
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,401
Let's take a little drive.

695
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,494
Shit.

696
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,300
Don't matter about the money now.

697
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,536
Don't matter about the money? Frank!
Look at this grease on my face, man.

698
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,544
You have any idea what I went
through to get this money?

699
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:19,079
I put my ass on the line
and vouched for you.

700
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,083
I thought I could count on you, Alan.

701
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:24,643
I promised certain people results.
They're expecting results now.

702
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,213
-If they don't get 'em…
-What did you bring me here for, Frank?

703
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,834
Your father's tool kit.

704
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:42,667
He comes in here yesterday
practically begging for another two grand.

705
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,105
And he gives me this for collateral.

706
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:48,610
I told him I can't loan him any
more, but he wouldn't take it back.

707
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,737
What am I gonna do
with a tool kit, Alan?

708
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:54,011
Thought that maybe you'd want it,
not that you need it anymore.

709
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,178
Go give 'em back to him.

710
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,381
He's down in section three.

711
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:03,485
Where he always is.

712
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:07,052
<i>There goes Swifty!</i>

713
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,780
<i>Erin?</i>

714
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:29,584
-Hi. I'm Nathan.
-Hi.

715
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:34,750
So, I take it this is your first time.

716
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:38,226
Yeah. You're the first suitor.

717
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,900
Suitor. I like that.
It's old fashioned.

718
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,799
I'm kind of an
old-fashioned guy myself.

719
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,162
You surprise me, frankly.

720
00:41:47,202 --> 00:41:49,500
Why?

721
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,636
You just don't seem
like the sort of woman

722
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:55,906
who would resort
to placing an ad.

723
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,573
Sorry.

724
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,448
I'm sure you get that
all the time.

725
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,579
You're a very attractive woman.

726
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,852
-So, you study God?
-God?

727
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,894
-Aren't you a divinity student?
-Yeah.

728
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,863
Well, God's an immense subject.
We don't have to talk about it.

729
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,991
I think it makes
some people uncomfortable.

730
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,366
No! Let's talk about God.

731
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:26,504
I'm the V.P. of Operations at
the Krylex Corporation in Waltham.

732
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,511
Krylex manufactures small rubber
parts for a variety of commercial

733
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:32,912
and industrial products-- products
ranging from the small rubber helmets

734
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,917
on wall-mounted spring door studs

735
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,884
to the waterproof gaskets on
street newspaper vending machines.

736
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,887
You're starting to glaze
over. I see it. Don't worry.

737
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,889
Happens all the time. I'm not
offended. I'll tell you why.

738
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,858
It's because most people are blind
to the impact small rubber parts

739
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,952
have on their daily lives.

740
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,963
Erin, how often do people
look under their phones?

741
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:51,831
Precisely. When you get home,
I'd urge you to do just that.

742
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,836
You'll appreciate what
I'm about to tell you.

743
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,406
The four small rubber nubs
that your phone rests on?

744
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,407
Admittedly, not very exciting.

745
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,409
But, consider what the consequences
would be without those rubber nubs.

746
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,139
You know, you don't say a lot

747
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,182
but it's pretty obvious
what you're telling me.

748
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:09,844
-Really?
-Your body language says it all.

749
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,854
You're palming me.

750
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,856
I'm sorry?

751
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:18,156
You're palming me. Your
palms are exposed to me.

752
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,720
When a woman does that,
she's subconsciously flirting.

753
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:24,323
Yeah? What does this mean?

754
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,562
Oh. Tiger, hmm?

755
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:31,471
Let's just sum up here, okay? God is
definitely a woman, because only a woman

756
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,066
would have the kind of compassion
necessary to create someone

757
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,078
as beautiful as you.

758
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,513
Okay. There is one giant
hole in your argument.

759
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,883
Daryl, no female deity would have had
the absence of mind to create you.

760
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:48,584
The male gender, a gender that spends all
of its time looking forward to getting off.

761
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:52,287
God is a man. Why?
Because men need women.

762
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,296
Women don't need men.

763
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:58,459
And yet, you're here.
It's a hole in your argument.

764
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:01,697
I collect art. South American, mostly.

765
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,160
Really? South American?

766
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,860
Have you been?

767
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,502
Yeah, my dad took me to Brazil
when I was very young.

768
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:10,739
But I love
Brazilian music.

769
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:13,908
Well, I was down there
for a conference ten days ago.

770
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,486
My tan's faded, but…

771
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:19,579
-That's it. You're playing with your hair.
-I'm bored.

772
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,885
Do you always deal
with people like this?

773
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,627
I… Well.

774
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:29,426
It's just that I've been taking this course in
communication and trying out things I learned.

775
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,433
Can I just drop it, I mean, really?

776
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,935
-I'm just so lonely.
-I'm sorry.

777
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:37,940
I can't meet people. It's like
I've got a sign on my forehead.

778
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,067
Yeah, that's the thing.

779
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:43,305
About God-- He's so hard
to pin down, at any moment.

780
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,746
-He?
-She.

781
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,646
You know, he, she, it.

782
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:49,651
As Cicero said

783
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:53,189
"Consistency is the
hobgoblin of little minds."

784
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,758
Ralph Waldo Emerson, you mean.

785
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,924
How come you never smile?

786
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,896
Would that make you more comfortable?

787
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:05,457
-You don't really like me, do you?
-No! I don't like poseurs.

788
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:08,299
I mean, you're probably
a very nice person

789
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:10,930
but I have no way of
knowing that, you know?

790
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:14,602
You're all uncomfortable,you're
telling all these strange jokes

791
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,509
and why are you trying
so hard to impress me?

792
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,605
You would be much more appealing
if you would just be yourself.

793
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:29,289
Here, let's see. " Frisky and carefree."

794
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,453
-So who's the poseur?
-My mother put in that ad.

795
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,157
Oh, really? Well, what's her number?

796
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:42,162
Who is the real Erin Castleton?

797
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:44,399
Please stand up.

798
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:47,671
Well, uh, what would you like to know?

799
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:51,908
First I'd like to know what
attracted you to nursing.

800
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,175
Other people's pain.

801
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:58,186
That's funny. I like that.

802
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:02,520
No, actually I was in medical
school at Harvard, but I dropped out.

803
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,526
Why?

804
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:08,564
I lost…

805
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:13,102
-I lost my motivation. It's a long story, anyway.
-Got all night. All morning.

806
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,103
Here you go, pal.

807
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,105
-Let me get this round.
-Refill?

808
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,107
-Yeah.
-Least I can do.

809
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,750
Uh, what the heck is that?

810
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:34,953
This is funny. I…

811
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:39,017
I was married once,
a long, long, long time ago.

812
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:43,623
But, I carry that as a sort
of, you know, good luck charm.

813
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:48,136
Well, I guess it's not working.

814
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:56,936
I can't put this here.
I got this dry-cleaned.

815
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:58,344
Don't worry, Kev.
There's plenty of room.

816
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:00,678
Just put it in the--

817
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:04,117
Aw, smells like fish, man. I'm
gonna get fish smell in my fabrics.

818
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:10,022
-Hello?
-Yeah, hi. My name is Erin.

819
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:12,118
You called about my ad in the Herald.

820
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:15,357
No, I think you must want my
brother Kevin. Hold on a second.

821
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:18,195
Hey, Kev! Telephone! It's for you!

822
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:20,634
Coming!

823
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:22,637
Sorry.

824
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:42,890
I got it! Hello?

825
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:48,226
This is he. Oh, it's nice
to finally meet you, Erin, so to speak.

826
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,028
Yeah, you'll have to excuse me.
I'm a little out of breath.

827
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:56,299
I'm moving out of the place I'm living in.
Yeah, I'm moving to a much nicer place.

828
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,367
You're the most beguiling
woman I've ever met.

829
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,974
You don't take men's
compliments very well, do you?

830
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:10,519
-I take what I need.
-Which is?

831
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:13,900
-Another round.
-You got it.

832
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,281
Barkeep, another round
for the lady, please.

833
00:48:17,391 --> 00:48:19,325
Thanks.

834
00:48:19,426 --> 00:48:22,327
I liked what you said
earlier about

835
00:48:22,429 --> 00:48:25,762
-what was that?
-sticking to your principles
and following your dreams.

836
00:48:25,866 --> 00:48:29,563
But, um, do you really
believe that if you do that

837
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:34,369
that things will just come to you
like it's destined?

838
00:48:34,474 --> 00:48:36,965
Yeah, I really do.

839
00:48:37,077 --> 00:48:39,102
You know, my brother says that a lot.

840
00:48:39,212 --> 00:48:43,114
You know, he says you create
your own luck, but…

841
00:48:43,216 --> 00:48:45,514
-You know, take me, for instance.
-No, no.

842
00:48:45,619 --> 00:48:47,678
No, let's take your brother.

843
00:48:47,788 --> 00:48:52,157
Okay. My brother.

844
00:48:52,259 --> 00:48:53,988
-What's his name?
-Alan.

845
00:48:54,094 --> 00:48:55,994
It's funny. When I think
of Alan, I think of

846
00:48:56,096 --> 00:48:59,623
what W.C. Fields said which was

847
00:48:59,733 --> 00:49:03,169
"Consistency is the
hobgoblin of little minds."

848
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:06,060
No, Emerson.
It was Ralph Waldo Emerson.

849
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:10,933
Well, whatever, I mean, whoever said it is
not so much important as I remembered it.

850
00:49:11,044 --> 00:49:14,960
But I think of him that way because
he's always, always in his books.

851
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,041
-Books?
-Yeah, you know.

852
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,912
-Really?
-and I respect his determination.

853
00:49:18,952 --> 00:49:21,760
I'm lucky, you know, because
I have more than determination.

854
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,960
I have determination plus talent
plus, like a natural intelligence

855
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,060
and then sort of a street savvy
that I think I've picked up myself.

856
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,760
And sometimes that's hard
to deal with, you know.

857
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,660
'Cause you know you've
got both barrels loaded.

858
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,660
And sometimes you only
wanna use one, but you can't.

859
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,860
You know, it's funny to
me when I think about it

860
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,541
because I remember back when
I was studying for the bar--

861
00:49:44,645 --> 00:49:47,307
And I don't think I had to study
as hard as a lot of people--

862
00:49:47,414 --> 00:49:51,545
Every night Alan was out
partying, and I'm at home

863
00:49:51,585 --> 00:49:54,660
directed, and now it's sort of weird.

864
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,688
Because, you know,
I'm out there. I'm grabbing.

865
00:49:57,791 --> 00:50:02,057
I'm taking, you know.
I see. I want. I take.

866
00:50:02,162 --> 00:50:06,360
And he just sits at home
every night and studies, so…

867
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,177
Puff? Oh, my God.

868
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,495
Freeze!

869
00:52:06,653 --> 00:52:11,352
But I'm not lonely.
I like to be by myself.

870
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:13,451
I mean, people
don't understand that.

871
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:19,032
You know, they think that you're a bitch
or that you must certainly be depressed.

872
00:52:19,132 --> 00:52:23,034
I mean, say a woman is
sitting alone in a bar reading.

873
00:52:23,136 --> 00:52:26,230
You know, a man who comes in,
he automatically makes an assumption

874
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:29,969
that she is either sitting there
waiting to be propositioned

875
00:52:30,077 --> 00:52:33,740
and, you know, if she doesn't want it,
then there must be something wrong with her

876
00:52:33,847 --> 00:52:36,839
because, you know,
what woman in her right mind

877
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:40,283
would be content just
sitting by herself, you know.

878
00:52:42,589 --> 00:52:45,717
But I'm not lonely when
I'm sitting in a bar by myself

879
00:52:45,826 --> 00:52:51,423
and I'm not even lonely
when I'm at home alone.

880
00:52:51,532 --> 00:52:56,629
I get… you get lonely
in a crowded room

881
00:52:56,737 --> 00:53:01,071
or a subway
that's packed with people.

882
00:53:01,174 --> 00:53:05,235
You know, all these people
and every one a stranger.

883
00:53:06,713 --> 00:53:11,275
My father had one
of those quiet Irish souls.

884
00:53:11,385 --> 00:53:13,580
He was a poet.

885
00:53:13,687 --> 00:53:18,522
Well, actually, he was a cardiologist,
but he wrote beautiful poetry.

886
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:23,028
He would take us to Ireland in the summers
and he and I would take these long walks

887
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:28,295
and then we would just sit
together staring out at the sea.

888
00:53:30,771 --> 00:53:35,572
He said that if you can learn to contemplate
just one beautiful thing every day

889
00:53:35,676 --> 00:53:38,543
that it would give you
something very special.

890
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,500
Ciúnas gan uaigneas

891
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,314
It's a Gaelic expression.

892
00:53:49,423 --> 00:53:52,950
It means
"Quietness without loneliness."

893
00:53:56,663 --> 00:54:01,066
Oh, my God.
I have been talking and talking.

894
00:54:01,168 --> 00:54:04,831
It seems for hours.
I'm sorry, Barry.

895
00:54:04,938 --> 00:54:06,906
It's… I think you're
the first man that I've met

896
00:54:07,007 --> 00:54:10,534
that hasn't had a pathological
need to talk about himself.

897
00:54:10,644 --> 00:54:15,081
But anyway, let's talk about you.

898
00:54:15,182 --> 00:54:18,583
-What do you do?
-I'm a therapist.

899
00:54:21,688 --> 00:54:24,452
Does that make you
feel uncomfortable?

900
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:31,286
<i>Today, youngsters throughout Boston</i>
<i>struggled to express their feelings</i>

901
00:54:31,398 --> 00:54:33,764

00:54:43,377 --> 00:54:46,437

910
00:55:05,899 --> 00:55:08,663
<i>What a shame. Thanks, Arnie.</i>

911
00:55:08,769 --> 00:55:12,432
<i>In national news, the Tantooni</i>
<i>standoff in Tantooni, Arizona--</i>

912
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:16,168
You know, a nurse.
It's like the expression

913
00:55:16,276 --> 00:55:19,040
"Consistency is the
hobgoblin of little minds."

914
00:55:19,146 --> 00:55:21,774
What did you just say?

915
00:55:21,882 --> 00:55:25,943
Oh, I was just quoting Marx, Karl Marx.

916
00:55:26,053 --> 00:55:30,353
I tend to contradict myself
a lot, you know,

917
00:55:30,457 --> 00:55:33,949
Especially around a…

918
00:55:34,061 --> 00:55:37,827
you know, a…

919
00:55:37,931 --> 00:55:40,866
You know, I'm feeling bloated.

920
00:55:40,967 --> 00:55:42,958
I'm gonna go, take a pee-ski, okay?

921
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:44,799
And you want anything?

922
00:55:44,905 --> 00:55:47,533
I mean, I'm sure you don't
want anything from the bathroom.

923
00:55:47,641 --> 00:55:50,132
I'll just go.

924
00:55:56,249 --> 00:55:58,911
That's gonna end up in my bank account.

925
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,852
You forget I was watching you.
I don't think you did so well.

926
00:56:01,955 --> 00:56:03,855
What are you talkin'about? I did great.

927
00:56:03,957 --> 00:56:06,255
Really couldn't see too well.

928
00:56:06,359 --> 01:52:12,659
How do you think he did?

929
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,260
Are you kidding?

930
00:56:09,362 --> 00:56:11,990
-He struck out.
-No surprise there.

931
00:56:12,099 --> 00:56:14,226
-Think she can see us?
-Nah.

932
00:56:14,334 --> 00:56:16,666
She wouldn't recognize us anyways.

933
00:56:19,806 --> 00:56:21,433
Hi, honey. I'm home.

934
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:23,509
-Eric?
-Yeah?

935
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:28,240
-I like you.
-I like you too.

936
00:56:29,649 --> 00:56:34,450
-You're my little hobgoblin.
-Number four.

937
00:56:34,554 --> 00:56:37,887
And I'd rub your head and make a wish,
but there's too many people watching.

938
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:39,891
What do you mean?

939
00:56:39,993 --> 00:56:43,861
-She's touching him.
-No. That can't be happening.

940
00:56:43,964 --> 00:56:47,957
But I'd like to be alone
with you some place.

941
00:56:48,068 --> 00:56:50,536
-Sure.
-No, not now, Eric.

942
00:56:50,637 --> 00:56:52,537
Right, I mean, we should wait.

943
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:54,937
-Tomorrow night.
-That's a good time.

944
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:56,941
A little getaway I know of.

945
00:56:57,043 --> 00:56:59,637
Don't tell anyone, okay?

946
00:56:59,746 --> 00:57:02,360
It's just gonna be our little secret.
You promise me?

947
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,546
Right, right, absolutely.
Why would I say anything?

948
00:57:04,651 --> 00:57:08,781
Meet me tomorrow night, 9:30.

949
00:57:18,064 --> 00:57:22,194
<i>It is a big deal, because Puff was</i>
<i>more than your average balloonfish.</i>

950
00:57:22,302 --> 00:57:25,135
-<i>She represented to the children</i>
-<i>She? Did you say "she"?</i>

951
00:57:25,238 --> 00:57:28,765
-<i>Puff was a female, yes.</i>
-I can't believe I gave her those notes.

952
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:31,469
-You know what I mean?
-What?

953
00:57:31,578 --> 01:55:03,078
-Talking about that girl Erin.
-Erin who?

954
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:36,743
Erin, the nurse.

955
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,613
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, she was sharp.

956
00:57:38,718 --> 00:57:40,948
She was nice. I mean, I think
she was intimidated by me.

957
00:57:41,054 --> 00:57:42,954
That's probably why
she didn't call back.

958
00:57:43,056 --> 00:57:46,583
Along those lines, why don't we go out to
Zanzibar tonight and pick up a couple of ladies?

959
00:57:46,693 --> 00:57:51,187
You know what, I'm out tonight.
I can't do it. I'm just not feeling up to it.

960
00:57:51,298 --> 00:57:54,233
-You guys go.
-I'm just gonna nuke some fish sticks tonight.

961
00:57:56,603 --> 00:57:58,935
Look on the bright side.
At least you didn't lose your money to me.

962
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,974
Let's go out. You gotta get back up
to the plate, man. Take your whiffs.

963
00:58:02,075 --> 00:58:06,100
<i>The prison will be privately</i>
<i>run and inmates charged for their stay.</i>

964
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,105
Hello? Who?

965
00:58:08,215 --> 00:58:12,948
The penal system took a detour into the twilight zone

966
00:58:13,053 --> 00:58:16,921
-No, I'm not surprised at all.
-once again, thanks to the crafty ways

967
00:58:17,023 --> 00:58:20,151
-Tonight?
-of Arty Milhous Lesser.

00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:23,855
-<i>It began this afternoon when the Suffolk County zoning</i>
-Sure, tonight's great.

969
00:58:23,964 --> 00:58:29,334
-<i>reluctantly awarded Lesser</i>
-9:30's perfect.
Our little secret, huh?

970
00:58:29,436 --> 00:58:33,805
Don't worry. I won't tell a soul.

971
00:58:37,911 --> 00:58:42,473
-Can I get you anything else?
-Just the check.

972
00:59:03,136 --> 00:59:05,934
-What are you doin'?
-Hey! Hey!

973
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:07,939
Outside!

974
00:59:14,147 --> 00:59:16,377
Get goin'! Get goin'!

975
00:59:26,059 --> 00:59:29,517
What are ya both of ya
doin' here, ya freaks?

976
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:07,327
Oh, don't wipe it off, Alan.
What? You didn't like it?

977
01:00:07,434 --> 01:00:10,835
I mean, it's not that I didn't like
it. It just came a little unexpectedly.

978
01:00:10,937 --> 01:00:14,270
Come on. You've been flirting with me
since I hired you as my tutor in September.

979
01:00:14,374 --> 01:00:16,638
-You didn't hire me as your tutor, all right?
-Yes, I did.

980
01:00:16,743 --> 01:00:19,303
I accepted the respon-- I'm tryin' to
help you out in the class. That's all.

981
01:00:19,412 --> 01:00:21,312
-I'm doin' you a favor.
-Don't deny it, Alan.

982
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:26,448
-Did you bring my notes, by the way?
-Oh.

983
01:00:26,553 --> 01:00:31,217
I forgot them, but they're home.
I'll give them to you tomorrow.

984
01:00:31,324 --> 01:00:35,693
Oh, good, well, you know, that was kind
of like the point of gettin' together.

985
01:00:35,795 --> 01:00:38,992
I mean, the thing is…
It's just I'm tryin' to finish a paper tonight.

986
01:00:39,099 --> 01:00:41,363
I mean, I kind of need the notes,
because that's what I took them for.

987
01:00:41,468 --> 01:00:45,268
Well, this is our date. I didn't know
I was supposed to bring a bunch of papers.

988
01:00:45,372 --> 01:00:49,365
It's not exactly. I mean, we were gonna get
together, and you were gonna give me the notes.

989
01:00:49,476 --> 01:00:52,502
I mean, that was sort of
the point of it, I thought.

990
01:00:52,612 --> 01:00:55,604
So you asked me to this
fancy restaurant on a date

991
01:00:55,715 --> 01:00:58,650
so I could bring you back your notes.

992
01:00:58,752 --> 01:01:00,811
That's really nice.

993
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:06,354
You look really beautiful.

994
01:01:08,128 --> 01:01:12,462
Thank you. I got dressed
up especially for our date.

995
01:01:14,634 --> 01:01:21,200
You know, I wonder if it would be possible
not to keep using that word, okay?

996
01:01:21,307 --> 01:01:24,708
You are funny.

997
01:01:24,811 --> 01:01:28,338
Have you ever seen a whale
swimming around in the ocean?

998
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:32,584
No.

999
01:01:32,685 --> 01:01:35,085
Maybe you'd like to go with me on this
whale watch. It's incredible out there.

1000
01:01:35,188 --> 01:01:37,281
I mean, first of all, it's, like,
a half hour out on the boat

1001
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:40,325
which is beautiful, and you're
looking over the expanse of the ocean.

1002
01:01:40,427 --> 01:01:42,691
And It's a very…

1003
01:01:42,796 --> 01:01:44,889
--"romantic" would be the wrong word--

1004
01:01:44,998 --> 01:01:49,332
just a serene pleasant time and I think
it'll perk up your interest in class.

1005
01:01:49,436 --> 01:01:52,303
-You wanna go?
-Yeah.

1006
01:01:52,405 --> 01:01:55,067
-All right. Well, let's see.
-So it's like another date.

1007
01:01:55,175 --> 01:01:57,405
No, I would say more of
a low-pressure, low-key

1008
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:59,876
kind of just a couple
of friends hanging out.

1009
01:01:59,979 --> 01:02:02,209
I'd really be interested
in that. Seriously.

1010
01:02:02,315 --> 01:02:05,250
-I read Moby Dick.
-Okay.

1011
01:02:06,419 --> 01:02:09,616
<i>Paging Dr. Betcher.</i>
<i>Paging Dr. Betcher, please.</i>

1012
01:02:13,693 --> 01:02:16,321
-Hi.
-Hi.

1013
01:02:16,429 --> 01:02:19,364
Paging Dr. Stateman.
Dr. Stateman, please.

1014
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:25,531
Bob's gay.

1015
01:02:25,638 --> 01:02:27,902
-He is?
-Yeah.

1016
01:02:28,007 --> 01:02:30,373
He came out on our last date.

1017
01:02:30,477 --> 01:02:35,540
That whole macho thing-- That
was, like, this huge cover-up.

1018
01:02:35,648 --> 01:02:38,139
I'm sorry.

1019
01:02:38,251 --> 01:02:41,846
Uh, you were right. I made,
like, this huge mistake.

1020
01:02:41,955 --> 01:02:46,392
It's just that Bob was there,
and I thought that that was my only choice.

1021
01:02:46,493 --> 01:02:49,587
You know, with men there's
always-- There's a choice.

1022
01:02:49,696 --> 01:02:52,256
It's just a really weak selection.

1023
01:02:52,365 --> 01:02:55,334
The only person that can
make you happy is yourself.

1024
01:02:55,435 --> 01:02:58,427
I know that sounds really hokey,
but I'm finding that to be true.

1025
01:02:58,538 --> 01:03:01,132
Yeah. Don't you just hate men?

1026
01:03:01,241 --> 01:03:04,972
Oh, God, I wish I did. That
would make my life so much easier.

1027
01:03:05,078 --> 01:03:09,014
-Who's got the malaria patient in room 18?
-He's mine.

1028
01:03:09,115 --> 01:03:13,142
Oh, to have been a mosquito
upon that man's cheek!

1029
01:03:13,253 --> 01:03:16,313
Mr. de Silva, you're dressed?

1030
01:03:16,422 --> 01:03:18,390
-Yes, I…
-I need to give you
a gamma globulin shot.

1031
01:03:18,491 --> 01:03:20,391
Would you take off your pants, please?

1032
01:03:20,493 --> 01:03:24,122
-I had all my shots yesterday.
-Not this one.

1033
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,130
-Should I take off my pants?
-Yes, sir.

1034
01:03:26,232 --> 01:03:28,132
-ust my pants, right?
-Just your pants.

1035
01:03:28,234 --> 01:03:30,532
Okay.

1036
01:03:42,382 --> 01:03:46,113
What?

1037
01:03:49,489 --> 01:03:51,650
You like bossa nova?

1038
01:03:54,327 --> 01:03:59,026
-This gonna hurt?
-It's gonna be painful sitting down for a little while.

1039
01:03:59,132 --> 01:04:00,531
My flight is on Friday.

1040
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:03,397
Where did you contract the malaria?

1041
01:04:03,503 --> 01:04:05,903
It was in Bolivia. I was on expedition.

1042
01:04:06,005 --> 01:04:09,463
I'm a musicologist.
I collect ethnic folk songs.

1043
01:04:09,576 --> 01:04:12,340
I'm going to Sao Paulo for holiday.

1044
01:04:12,445 --> 01:04:15,005
You like my country's music, right?

1045
01:04:15,114 --> 01:04:17,947
-I can tell there is a little bit of Brazil in you.
-Oh, yeah?

1046
01:04:18,051 --> 01:04:21,817
See, you are sad and happy.

1047
01:04:21,921 --> 01:04:23,821
You don't smile, but you are content.

1048
01:04:23,923 --> 01:04:25,823
You are sad and happy at the same time.

1049
01:04:25,925 --> 01:04:28,086
In Brazil we have a term
for that. It is saudade.

1050
01:04:28,194 --> 01:04:33,188
It's like melancholy,
nostalgia. It's very bossa nova.

1051
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,600
§ Tristeza não tem fim. §

1052
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,400
§ Felicidade sim. §

1053
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:42,069
It means…

1054
01:04:42,175 --> 01:04:46,077
Sadness has no end. Happiness does.

1055
01:04:46,179 --> 01:04:50,616
-I like that song.
-Yes, it's a very good song.

1056
01:04:50,717 --> 01:04:54,153
Listen, there's a club in Somerville that
plays Brazilian music if you are interested.

1057
01:04:54,254 --> 01:04:57,382
-I work the night shift.
-Well, what time do you get out?

1058
01:05:01,694 --> 01:05:05,425
I'm sorry. That was very forward of me.

1059
01:05:05,531 --> 01:05:11,128
-I do not ever, ever
-Show me your hands.

1060
01:05:11,237 --> 01:05:13,705
I'm not married.

1061
01:05:13,806 --> 01:05:16,741
Well, you might have taken it off and put
it in your wallet. You know, men do that.

1062
01:05:16,843 --> 01:05:18,811
I'm not that kind of man.

1063
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:22,938
My wallet just has pieces
of paper and lots of plastic.

1064
01:05:23,049 --> 01:05:26,246
I'm becoming a plastic person
I have so much plastic in…

1065
01:05:26,352 --> 01:05:30,789
I get out at 7:30 in the morning.

1066
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:36,123
Well, my name is Andre de Silva.

1067
01:05:36,229 --> 01:05:38,823
And it was a pleasure having
you care for me…

1068
01:05:38,931 --> 01:05:42,128
-Erin.
-Erin. Yes.

1069
01:05:42,235 --> 01:05:45,932
You should have said it was a pain
in the ass. An American would have.

1070
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:49,770
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1071
01:05:49,876 --> 01:05:54,108
I know, but I am
Brazilian, and we--

1072
01:06:04,023 --> 01:06:05,923
Erin.

1073
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,832
-See you, Al.
-All right, Stu.

1074
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,800
-Take care, Stu.
-All right. See you later.

1075
01:06:21,941 --> 01:06:23,841
-Hey, Alan.
-Hey, Ben.

1076
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:28,000
-They want to see you up in Administration.
-Yeah.

1077
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,514
Sit down.

1078
01:06:36,923 --> 01:06:40,950
We're all a little distracted
because of this latest incident.

1079
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:44,029
Attendance has skyrocketed
because of all this publicity.

1080
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:46,963
But all the kids want to see
now is the piranha exhibit.

1081
01:06:47,066 --> 01:06:49,500
Poor Puff, eh?

1082
01:06:49,602 --> 01:06:53,402
You volunteer a lot of hours here, Alan.

1083
01:06:53,506 --> 01:06:55,337
It's well worth it, Miss Shebola.

1084
01:06:55,441 --> 01:06:58,035
We think so too. We'd like
to start paying you for them.

1085
01:06:58,144 --> 01:07:00,840
It's great, because
I could really use the money.

1086
01:07:00,947 --> 01:07:06,283
Yuri Spinov needs a part-time assistant
in Physical Plant. He recommended you.

1087
01:07:06,386 --> 01:07:08,650
We know it's a change from
what you've been doing.

1088
01:07:08,755 --> 01:07:10,746
But it will put you on staff.

1089
01:07:14,494 --> 01:07:16,860
Well, I'll have to just
think about it a little bit.

1090
01:07:16,963 --> 01:07:20,262
Of course. Let us know by Monday?

1091
01:07:20,366 --> 01:07:22,561
Okay.

1092
01:07:23,469 --> 01:07:27,735
-Oh, God.
-This is to South American men with good sweaters.

1093
01:07:29,142 --> 01:07:31,000
But you should go back.

1094
01:07:31,644 --> 01:07:33,908
You really should.
The people are so wonderful.

1095
01:07:34,013 --> 01:07:35,913
That spirit-- You don't
find it anywhere else.

1096
01:07:36,015 --> 01:07:40,611
And the land.
The beaches are wonderful.

1097
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,780
-Some day I will go back.
-You should go back. I'm going back.

1098
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:47,417
-Yeah, why?
-This city…

1099
01:07:47,527 --> 01:07:52,965
It's all schools and hospitals
and bars and graveyards.

1100
01:07:53,065 --> 01:07:56,762
The young people here, all they
do is-- They study, and they drink.

1101
01:07:56,869 --> 01:08:00,236
It's terrible. I think one's
school year should be spent

1102
01:08:00,339 --> 01:08:04,571
you know, by the ocean walking with
someone that they love very much,

1103
01:08:04,677 --> 01:08:10,274
eating fried fish by the…

1104
01:08:10,383 --> 01:08:13,750
Anyway, you should go back.
You should go there.

1105
01:08:13,853 --> 01:08:16,447
I think you should be somewhere warm.
I think it would be good for your heart.

1106
01:08:16,556 --> 01:08:21,323
I don't know. I guess-- I feel that
if I left right now I would be running away.

1107
01:08:21,427 --> 01:08:23,327
Running away? I don't understand.

1108
01:08:23,429 --> 01:08:28,093
If you're running away, somebody's chasing you.
So what is it that's chasing you?

1109
01:08:30,303 --> 01:08:32,999
Personal business. I understand.

1110
01:08:33,105 --> 01:08:37,701
So let's make a toast. To perhaps the
most beautiful woman that ever lived.

1111
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:40,643
Yes, the most beautiful woman
that ever lived which is you.

1112
01:08:40,746 --> 01:08:43,681
-Let's not confuse matters.
-And to me, the greatest man that ever lived.

1113
01:08:43,783 --> 01:08:45,683
Okay.

1114
01:08:45,785 --> 01:08:48,253
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1115
01:08:50,756 --> 01:08:51,900
Oh, geez.

1116
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,800
I'm going to buy you the most expensive
$5 bottle of wine you ever saw.

1117
01:09:29,829 --> 01:09:35,426
Look what I got us: a bottle
of wine and a corkscrew.

1118
01:09:47,146 --> 01:09:52,049
No, no, don't, don't.

1119
01:09:52,151 --> 01:09:56,485
I need to get some air.
I need to get out of here.

1120
01:09:57,189 --> 01:09:59,487
<i>Grab your binoculars and cameras,</i>
<i>folks, and get up on the deck</i>

1121
01:09:59,592 --> 01:10:04,256
<i>because in another few minutes, we'll be</i>
<i>entering the humpback whale feeding grounds.</i>

1122
01:10:04,363 --> 01:10:06,593
What we have here is hands
down the best whale watching--

1123
01:10:06,699 --> 01:10:10,396
You all right?

1124
01:10:10,503 --> 01:10:14,030
My stomach is just,
like, wobbly, gobbly.

1125
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:16,973
You know what's good. Just
look out there on the horizon.

1126
01:10:17,076 --> 01:10:18,100
Where?

1127
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,103
The horizon would be
where the land and the sea meet.

1128
01:10:21,213 --> 01:10:23,841
Right. Just look directly out there
and take a couple of deep--

1129
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:26,180
-Okay.
-Can you breathe deeply?

1130
01:10:26,285 --> 01:10:28,549
Feelin' a little better now?

1131
01:10:28,654 --> 01:10:30,554
Huh. Whoa.

1132
01:10:30,656 --> 01:10:33,454
<i>Look at that! Spectacular!</i>

1133
01:10:33,559 --> 01:10:35,652
Oh, shit!

1134
01:10:35,761 --> 01:10:38,753
Alan, I'm really sorry.
I'm being such a drag.

1135
01:10:38,864 --> 01:10:42,027
I'm keeping you from watching the
fish. Why don't you just go up there?

1136
01:10:42,134 --> 01:10:44,034
-I'll be all right here.
-No, no, no, no.

1137
01:10:44,136 --> 01:10:46,036
-No, go.
-No, I wouldn't dream of it.

1138
01:10:46,138 --> 01:10:48,436
-No, I feel really bad.
-It's just like a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

1139
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:50,771
It's not a big deal.
No, I'm just kidding.

1140
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:54,073
I'll come back out when you're feelin' better.

1141
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:56,944
Without you, but I'll come back out.

1142
01:10:59,318 --> 01:11:04,312
You know what. I'm really not feeling very
well. I think I should just walk myself home.

1143
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,826
No, I think you should stay.
It's fine.

1144
01:11:08,928 --> 01:11:10,900
I don't think I'm going to be
very good company right now.

1145
01:11:11,697 --> 01:11:16,259
This is the perfect company.
Look-- Look at the water.

1146
01:11:16,369 --> 01:11:19,133
That's very beautiful, like, like you.

1147
01:11:19,238 --> 01:11:23,334
See, it's-- You can be alone, but to be
alone with someone else who is alone--

1148
01:11:23,442 --> 01:11:27,435
Alone together--
That-- That is perfect.

1149
01:11:27,546 --> 01:11:30,037
-Do you know what I mean?
-I know what you mean.

1150
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:32,947
Relaxation is everything.
It's the answer.

1151
01:11:33,052 --> 01:11:35,543
See, what relaxes you? Tell me.

1152
01:11:35,655 --> 01:11:39,489
You like to fly, right?

1153
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,500
-I am terrified of flying.
-Oh, perfect.

1154
01:11:41,594 --> 01:11:43,585
Now you are in a two-seater

1155
01:11:43,696 --> 01:11:47,359
and it is being flown by my father who
weighs 462 pounds, because he lost 10.

1156
01:11:47,466 --> 01:11:50,299
And he can't see
out of his right eye or his left.

1157
01:11:50,403 --> 01:11:53,031
It changes.
And the plane goes like this.

1158
01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:55,437
And there's clouds inside
the plane, outside the plane.

1159
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:57,805
And then all of a sudden, you're
getting sick. You're about to scream.

1160
01:11:57,910 --> 01:12:01,107
And then the plane just drops,
and you look out the window.

1161
01:12:01,213 --> 01:12:04,114
Then it clears, and there's beautiful
sunlight in the plane, and you look out

1162
01:12:04,216 --> 01:12:06,184
and you see Corcovado.

1163
01:12:06,285 --> 01:12:10,221
-Oh!
-Ah, and the beaches
and then the plane just glides in.

1164
01:12:10,322 --> 01:12:13,519
The door opens, and you're there.
You relax, and it's perfect.

1165
01:12:13,626 --> 01:12:16,117
-It's beautiful.
-Yes, very beautiful.

1166
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:24,000
So why don't you come with me
to Sao Paulo?

1167
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:29,403
-You're joking.
-No, I'm not joking.

1168
01:12:31,477 --> 02:25:02,877
God! Look at your
tattoo.

1169
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:37,807
That is, like, so cool.
That's like Popeye.

1170
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:39,908
It's really hard.

1171
01:12:40,019 --> 01:12:43,045
You know, Julie,

1172
01:12:43,155 --> 01:12:45,180
Seriously, you know,
I know what you're thinking.

1173
01:12:45,291 --> 01:12:46,400
And I mean…

1174
01:12:43,045 --> 01:12:47,725
Really, I…

1175
01:12:47,827 --> 01:12:50,819
-What am I thinking?
-I just invited you out here

1176
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:53,421
because I wanted you
to experience this with me.

1177
01:12:53,532 --> 01:12:55,727
-Oh.
-All right? I'm sorry. I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

1178
01:12:55,835 --> 01:12:59,703
-So you don't have any desire to kiss me?
-Oh, no, no.

1179
01:12:59,805 --> 01:13:02,239
-You don't?
-No, of course, I have a desire to kiss you.

1180
01:13:02,341 --> 01:13:06,744
-But I just think
it would be best…  -I like you a lot.

1181
01:13:06,846 --> 01:13:09,007
Oh, I like you a lot too.

1182
01:13:09,115 --> 01:13:11,500
-You do?
-Yeah.

1183
01:13:11,117 --> 01:13:13,415
Geez--

1184
01:13:15,321 --> 01:13:17,721
-I will take care of everything. Visa.
-I can't believe you're asking me this.

1185
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:20,690
-We're strangers.
-We are not strangers.

1186
01:13:20,793 --> 01:13:22,693
I have known you at least
two lifetimes that I know of.

1187
01:13:22,795 --> 01:13:25,059
-Oh, don't give me that bullshit, please.
-How is that bullshit?

1188
01:13:25,164 --> 01:13:27,860
-I know how you feel.
-I don't know what I feel.

1189
01:13:27,967 --> 01:13:30,629
I have to spend Thanksgiving
with my mother in Manhattan.

1190
01:13:30,736 --> 01:13:34,194
No, no, that's wrong.
Forget your mother.

1191
01:13:34,306 --> 01:13:37,798
-I love my mother.
-Yes, I love your mother.

1192
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:41,038
I don't know her. When I know
her, I will love her, but--

1193
01:13:41,147 --> 01:13:43,581
Do this for you, darling. Please, come.

1194
01:13:43,682 --> 01:13:46,150
-No, no, no, no.
-Oh, yes.

1195
01:13:46,252 --> 01:13:48,846
Yes, come for a little bit.

1196
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:07,764
-I don't think this is really
gonna work out like this.  -Why?

1197
01:14:07,873 --> 01:14:09,773
I mean…

1198
01:14:16,515 --> 01:14:19,313
I just want this to mean something.

1199
01:14:19,418 --> 01:14:22,285
It means a lot to me.

1200
01:14:28,327 --> 01:14:30,295
I'm gonna walk myself home from here.

1201
01:14:32,565 --> 01:14:35,193
Listen, I leave in three days.

1202
01:14:41,473 --> 01:14:44,203
Three days.

1203
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:47,507
I fly planes.

1204
01:14:47,613 --> 01:14:50,446
I was adopted.
My father is not my father.

1205
01:14:50,549 --> 01:14:53,541
I'm not going to get fat.

1206
01:15:15,241 --> 01:15:18,733
-Hey.
-Hi.

1207
01:15:18,844 --> 01:15:23,679
-You cut your hair.
-Yeah.

1208
01:15:25,751 --> 01:15:30,688
Uh, well, we finished the job.

1209
01:15:30,789 --> 01:15:34,190
We stopped them from building
the dam, we saved the land,

1210
01:15:34,293 --> 01:15:37,057
the reservation,
the river, everything.

1211
01:15:37,162 --> 01:15:39,528
What are you doin' in Boston?

1212
01:15:39,632 --> 01:15:43,534
Well…

1213
01:15:43,636 --> 01:15:46,901
We saved the burial grounds.

1214
01:15:47,006 --> 01:15:49,531
And the Tantoonis were very grateful.

1215
01:15:49,642 --> 01:15:54,375
They were so grateful that they
decided to build a casino on it.

1216
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:58,041
You know? It's just all about money.

1217
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:02,086
You know, my heart isn't in it anymore.

1218
01:16:02,187 --> 01:16:06,089
It was just really lonely down there.

1219
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:10,594
I really missed you, and I'm wrong.

1220
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:13,859
You're the one

1221
01:16:13,966 --> 01:16:17,060
who doesn't need to change.

1222
01:16:17,169 --> 01:16:21,833
I'm the one who needs to change.

1223
01:16:21,941 --> 01:16:25,138
I don't want you to change.

1224
01:16:25,244 --> 01:16:30,079
I mean, don't ever change.
You know what I mean.

1225
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:08,074
-Come on.
-The paper.

1226
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:11,513
<i>This better be good.</i>
<i>Did you spell-check it?</i>

1227
01:18:11,617 --> 01:18:14,745
-I slaved for hours.
-All right.

1228
01:18:14,853 --> 01:18:17,321
I'm trying to make what we've
got together mean something.

1229
01:18:17,423 --> 01:18:20,756
I know. It means everything.

1230
01:19:03,001 --> 01:19:06,732
In northern Brazil, people
who believe in Candomble

1231
01:19:06,839 --> 01:19:10,275
they offer this to the
goddess of the sea, Iemanja.

1232
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:14,607
Now, there is also supposed to be
fried fish. I thought better of it.

1233
01:19:16,415 --> 01:19:19,646
What is this offering for?

1234
01:19:19,751 --> 01:19:22,151
Good luck.

1235
01:19:25,891 --> 01:19:31,090
-What is this?
-I leave tomorrow morning.

1236
01:19:31,196 --> 01:19:34,791
Erin, will you come with me?

1237
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:38,631
You are crazy.

1238
01:19:38,737 --> 01:19:41,297
Yes, crazy for you.

1239
01:19:59,258 --> 01:20:02,819
<i>There goes Swifty!</i>

1240
01:20:07,733 --> 01:20:11,669
A lot of worry about nothing.
Busted blood vessel or somethin'.

1241
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:13,601
Guess I gotta lighten
up on the booze, huh?

1242
01:20:13,705 --> 01:20:16,299
That's great, Frank. You know,
I'm really glad you're gonna live.

1243
01:20:16,408 --> 01:20:21,004
But actually I just
came by to give you this.

1244
01:20:21,113 --> 01:20:24,344
This is way more than
just one installment.

1245
01:20:24,449 --> 01:20:27,111
I got a part-time job,
and I'm gettin' you

1246
01:20:27,219 --> 01:20:30,552
off my back once and for all, all right?

1247
01:20:30,656 --> 01:20:32,817
Hey, Frank, what the hell are you doin'?

1248
01:20:32,925 --> 01:20:37,453
Certain associates of mine really appreciated
what you did, how it all worked out.

1249
01:20:37,563 --> 01:20:42,227
The attendance at the aquarium
has doubled. It didn't work out.

1250
01:20:42,334 --> 01:20:45,997
The point is, you worked out, Alan.

1251
01:20:46,104 --> 01:20:48,129
And this

1252
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,902
is your reward.

1253
01:20:53,178 --> 01:20:57,308
Hey, Arty!
This is my boy, Alan.

1254
01:20:57,416 --> 01:21:01,648
-Alan, say hello to Mr. Lesser.
-It's good to finally meet ya.

1255
01:21:01,753 --> 01:21:05,154
Frankie's told me a lot about
ya. He said you were a student.

1256
01:21:05,257 --> 01:21:09,057
You look like you've been out of short
pants for a while now. What are you, 40, 41?

1257
01:21:09,161 --> 01:21:13,427
-No, I'm 35.
-35, huh?

1258
01:21:13,532 --> 01:21:17,593
You're at a pivotal
junction in your life, Alan.

1259
01:21:19,638 --> 01:21:22,038
It's good to have you aboard.

1260
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:24,700
Greyhounds now
entering the--

1261
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:28,541
Frankie, we got a wacko down on
the new waterfront place there.

1262
01:21:28,647 --> 01:21:30,842
Come on! He's makin'
waves. Do somethin'.

1263
01:21:30,949 --> 01:21:33,509
Or maybe use this new
guy here? Send him down.

1264
01:21:33,619 --> 01:21:37,055
I'll get on it right away, Mr. Lesser.

1265
01:21:37,155 --> 01:21:41,455
Number Five, Satin Flame, 70 pounds.

1266
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:46,862
Number Six, Burden's Drought, 73.

1267
01:21:46,965 --> 01:21:51,868
Number Seven, It Is Gently, 72.

1268
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:55,565
Number Eight,Jar Man, 75.

1269
01:22:17,663 --> 01:22:19,563
-Hello?
-Erin, hi.

1270
01:22:19,665 --> 01:22:22,600
-It's me. Are you packing?
-Hi.

1271
01:22:22,701 --> 01:22:24,794
-Oh, my sweet.
-Yeah, I'm packing.

1272
01:22:24,903 --> 01:22:27,235
You know, I want to come
over and help you pack.

1273
01:22:27,339 --> 01:22:30,433
-We should pack together.
-Um, no, no, no, don't.

1274
01:22:30,542 --> 01:22:33,670
I'm sorry, darling. I
get so eager to see you.

1275
01:22:33,779 --> 01:22:38,216
I'll see you at the airport tomorrow.
I'll be there in the morning.

1276
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:47,718
What does that mean?

1277
01:22:47,826 --> 01:22:50,954
Ah, what this
means, darling--

1278
01:22:51,063 --> 01:22:54,794
It means, "I want your love for me.

1279
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:58,097
The two of us like this until the end.

1280
01:22:58,203 --> 01:23:02,936
I do not want sadness anymore.
I will make you happy

1281
01:23:03,041 --> 01:23:05,805
and destiny is what tells me this."

1282
01:23:05,911 --> 01:23:08,846
Erin, I will make you smile.

1283
01:23:08,947 --> 01:23:11,313
I swear I will, Erin.

1284
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:14,681
So, uh, tomorrow at the airport, right?

1285
01:23:14,786 --> 01:23:17,914
-Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
-Good, and, please, a small bag.

1286
01:23:18,023 --> 01:23:21,220
All you need is toothpaste
and a little two-piece.

1287
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:38,101
Puff?

1288
01:24:45,777 --> 01:24:49,941
What time your train is
gonna arrive tomorrow?

1289
01:24:50,015 --> 01:24:52,916
Oh, it's gonna be so fabulous.

1290
01:24:53,018 --> 01:24:56,351
Everybody's gonna be there.
Everybody is dying to see you.

1291
01:24:56,455 --> 01:24:58,389
Dodge is gonna be there.

1292
01:24:58,490 --> 01:25:01,891
Brazil, wow. Does that
sound beautiful, huh?

1293
01:25:01,993 --> 01:25:04,723
I hear that's beautiful this
time of the year. Brazil.

1294
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:06,821
That's way past Medford, Brazil.

1295
01:25:11,002 --> 01:25:14,563
-What time's your flight?
-9:35.

1296
01:25:14,673 --> 01:25:19,406
-You're not gonna make it.
-I'm sorry?

1297
01:25:19,511 --> 01:25:23,743
You're not gonna make
it. The tunnel is jammed.

1298
01:25:23,849 --> 01:25:25,942
Oh, I have to make it.

1299
01:25:26,051 --> 01:25:28,781
The tunnel is clogged.

1300
01:25:28,887 --> 01:25:33,756
All right, um-- All right, take me
to Bowdoin Station, the Blue Line.

1301
01:25:52,878 --> 01:25:55,779
<i>Airport Station next.</i>

1302
01:25:55,881 --> 01:25:58,782
<i>Change here for the airport</i>
<i>terminal shuttle. Next stop, Airport.</i>

1303
01:26:36,621 --> 01:26:39,681
<i>This is Airport Station.</i>

1304
01:26:51,803 --> 01:26:53,202
<i>Excuse me.</i>

1305
01:26:53,305 --> 01:26:56,274
<i>I'm trying to get out of here.</i>
<i>Why don't you just knock me down?</i>

1306
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:00,610
<i>Come on!</i>

1307
01:27:06,184 --> 01:27:08,084
<i>This is Airport Station.</i>

1308
01:27:14,192 --> 01:27:17,559
<i>Change here for the</i>
<i>airport terminal shuttle.</i>

1309
01:27:31,476 --> 01:27:34,036
<i>This is Airport Station.</i>

1310
01:27:34,145 --> 01:27:38,081
<i>Change here for the Logan</i>
<i>Airport terminal shuttle.</i>

1311
01:27:40,919 --> 01:27:43,251
<i>Wonderland Station will be next.</i>

1312
01:27:44,422 --> 01:27:46,720
<i>Next stop, Wonderland.</i>

1313
01:27:57,469 --> 01:27:59,869
Headset?

1314
01:27:59,971 --> 01:28:03,099
-In-flight movie?
-Yes. Thank you.

1315
01:28:03,208 --> 01:28:06,609
-Headset?
-Yes, please.

1316
01:28:06,711 --> 01:28:10,738
-In-flight movie
-None for me, thanks, and none for the lady.

1317
01:28:10,849 --> 01:28:12,749
-Headset?
-Yes.

1318
01:28:16,287 --> 01:28:21,000
-So. You are traveling alone?
-Yes.

1319
01:28:22,627 --> 01:28:24,527
And you?

1320
01:28:24,629 --> 01:28:28,429
Yes.

1321
01:28:28,533 --> 01:28:32,196
It seems always alone.

1322
01:28:34,105 --> 01:28:36,096
You travel for business?

1323
01:28:36,207 --> 01:28:39,005
No. For pleasure.

1324
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:41,874
Ah! Pleasure.

1325
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:45,279
Well, you must like my
country's music then.

1326
01:28:45,383 --> 01:28:47,851
Yes, I do.

1327
01:28:58,830 --> 01:29:03,290
That's beautiful, but what does it mean?

1328
01:29:04,936 --> 01:29:07,962
Ah, what this means. May I?

1329
01:29:09,941 --> 01:29:13,536
It means this, darling.

1330
01:29:13,645 --> 01:29:15,840
§ So close your eyes §

1331
01:29:15,947 --> 01:29:20,384
§ For that's your lovely way to be §

1332
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:24,285
§ Aware of things your heart alone §

1333
01:29:24,389 --> 01:29:27,324
§ Was meant to see §

1334
01:29:27,425 --> 01:29:29,300
-Over there?
-Right over here.

1335
01:29:29,494 --> 01:29:31,394
§ The fundamental loneliness goes §

1336
01:29:31,496 --> 01:29:34,897
§ Whenever two can
dream a dream together §

1337
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:40,103
-Feelin' a little better?
-Yeah, a little. Thanks. I…

1338
01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:42,366
-This way?
-I'm sorry about that. I…

1339
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:46,000
-No. That's totally all right.
-I think I just needed some air or something.

1340
01:29:47,212 --> 01:29:51,478
-The train was so crowded.
-I know, yeah. I mean, that Airport Station is horrible.

1341
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:53,483
-People are, like, shoving.
-Yeah.

1342
01:29:53,585 --> 01:29:55,985
They're in such a rush
to get outta there.

1343
01:29:56,087 --> 01:29:57,987
-Sit down.
-Thanks.

1344
01:29:58,089 --> 01:30:01,490
Yeah, my father used to bring
us to this beach all the time.

1345
01:30:01,593 --> 01:30:03,618
I still come here every
day to read or relax.

1346
01:30:03,728 --> 01:30:05,696
Do you? Every day, that's so nice.

1347
01:30:05,797 --> 01:30:09,255
Well, I think it's important to have
some daily ritual in your life

1348
01:30:09,367 --> 01:30:13,997
that gives it a sense
of consistency, you know?

1349
01:30:14,105 --> 01:30:16,130
Consistency?

1350
01:30:16,241 --> 01:30:18,232
Yeah.

1351
01:30:18,343 --> 01:30:22,575
But, uh, um, wouldn't
you say that, uh

1352
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:27,879
"Consistency is the, uh,
hobgoblin of little minds"?

1353
01:30:29,821 --> 01:30:33,450
Well, actually, it's:
"A foolish consistency

1354
01:30:33,558 --> 01:30:36,026
is the hobgoblin of little minds."

1355
01:30:36,127 --> 01:30:38,618
-That's Ralph Waldo Emerson.
-Waldo Emerson, right.

1356
01:30:41,399 --> 01:30:44,334
But I don't think coming to a place
like this every day is foolish.

1357
01:30:44,435 --> 01:30:46,995
No. No, not at all.

1358
01:30:47,105 --> 01:30:51,303
Because I think it's important
sometimes just to sit in a quiet place

1359
01:30:51,409 --> 01:30:53,843
and stare out at
the sea and just--

1360
01:30:53,945 --> 01:30:56,812
Contemplate something beautiful.

1361
01:31:02,787 --> 01:31:04,687
It's funny, though.

1362
01:31:04,789 --> 01:31:07,849
I never realized such a beautiful
beach was so close to Boston.

1363
01:31:07,959 --> 01:31:10,860
Well, it's not always this nice.

1364
01:31:21,906 --> 01:31:27,003
Well, I guess I better get home.

1365
01:31:27,111 --> 01:31:30,100
-You wanna take a walk?
-I'd love it.

1366
01:31:30,281 --> 01:31:31,543
-Great.
-Okay.

1367
01:31:31,649 --> 01:31:35,551
Ah, it's right down here.
