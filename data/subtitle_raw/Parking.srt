<b>PARKING

00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:21,010
.:: P r i j e v o d i - O n l i n e ::.

3
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,880
Adrian, what happened ?

4
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,480
Nothing.

5
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,980
I didn't hear from you.

6
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,320
You said you'd call.
-Yeah, well.

7
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,680
I have something I can't get rid of.
I have some urgent business.

8
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,760
I've had enough of this place.
Any problems ?

9
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,200
No.

10
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,020
Well, one morning
I found the fence cut.

11
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,100
They probably wanted BMW wheels.

12
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,760
But it was fine.

13
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,080
Nobody better steal that Porsche.

14
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,160
I bet you were fast asleep.

15
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,360
Rafa, I didn't hear a thing.

16
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,920
It was at the far end.
And even...

17
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,200
Good, keep your eyes wide open.

18
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,760
I told you these Sector Sur guys
don't mess around.

19
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,160
See you tomorrow.

20
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,360
What's going on there ?

21
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,880
I'm calling the police.

22
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,440
You motherfucking thieves !

23
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,960
Look at that.

24
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,360
He's one of us.

25
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,560
You motherfucker.

26
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,960
What ? You're Romanian ?

27
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,477
Well, what the fuck are you ?

28
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,360
And where are you from ?
-Teleorman. You ?

29
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,240
Singeorz-Bai.

30
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,040
Alright, man.
-You're all Romanian ?

31
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,160
Yeah, man.
Come on, turn off the headlights.

32
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,840
What are you taking ?
-None of your business.

33
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,160
Don't come after these cars. Got it ?

34
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,177
Relax, man.
We don't want your cars.

35
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,353
Give the poor bastard a box
and let's go.

36
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,200
Here, man !

37
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,600
You're in luck.
We've all got to get by.

38
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,120
Close it up !

39
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,520
Come on !

40
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,960
What about the rats ?

41
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,320
They're everywhere.

42
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,480
What do you think the gun's for ?

43
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,880
How many do you think I can kill ?

44
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,040
They come from
the parcel warehouse next door.

45
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,800
We've plenty of rats and roaches.

46
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,720
With customers it's a different story.
But good times are coming.

47
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,560
I'll get you a bigger trailer,
you'll have a proper home.

48
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,493
It's not good being alone.
A man needs a woman.

49
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,300
I told you, I've got a woman.

50
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,880
In Romania.

51
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,280
It's so stifling back home.

52
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,090
And not just because of the heat.

53
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,280
What's up ?

54
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,547
I'm divorcing my wife.
It's a living hell with her.

55
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,920
I might lose Rafaelito.

56
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,200
How come ?

57
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,080
She's a real snake.

58
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,320
You know the type.

59
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,920
Leave her for another woman
and she makes your life hell.

60
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,187
You have no idea
what she's capable of.

61
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,820
A woman can make you

62
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,620
or break you.

63
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,300
That's what my dad used to say.
-He was right.

64
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,360
Come on, go.

65
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,920
Let's get some sleep.

66
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,760
It's three o'clock,
two in the Canary Islands.

67
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,160
Four in Romania.

68
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,600
What's up ?

69
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,000
Come and meet Mercedes.

70
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,000
I need a favour.
You have to take an Audi to Candás.

71
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,640
To Candás ?
And how will I get back ?

72
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,280
Come on...
Don't worry about that now.

73
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,360
Mercedes, this is Adrian.

74
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,760
Hi.

75
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,680
Hi. Rafa told me lots about you.

76
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,530
He says you're the best
security guard he had.

77
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,520
Yeah. Let's sit down.

78
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,000
Darling, do we have any wine ?
-Course.

79
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,683
I'll bring it.
-Where is it ?

80
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,400
I'll get it, sit down.

81
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,200
Eat.

82
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,920
Try some quince jam.

83
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,100
So how come you came to Spain ?

84
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,120
After 30 years
in the same hole in the wall,

85
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,780
you kinda need a change of scenery.

86
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,920
How long have you been here ?

87
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,320
Almost six months.
-Your Spanish is great.

88
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,120
Is it ?
-Yes !

89
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,320
Rafael said you didn't speak
a word of Spanish when you arrived.

90
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,700
I had a note that said
"looking for work".

91
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,340
All I knew was
how to wave and say "hola".

92
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,800
I learned all my Spanish
from Rafael and the radio.

93
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,400
He's hardly an ideal teacher.
Rafa, I mean.

94
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,000
No, he's great.

95
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,000
He always spoke to me
as if I'm Spanish.

96
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,600
Yeah. You can learn any language
if you've got somebody beside you.

97
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,200
Cheers.

98
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,440
Noroc.

99
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,840
What ?
-Noroc.

100
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,760
I understand you want to bring
your family here.

101
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,740
Is pretty much told.

102
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,280
You have a wife ?

103
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,440
Yeah.

104
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,880
What does your wife do ?
-She's a teacher.

105
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,880
I don't know what
she could do here.

106
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,080
You have kids ?

107
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,760
No.

108
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,200
Then it should not be so difficult.

109
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,440
How much it would cost
to bring her over ?

110
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,840
It's not just about money.

111
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,140
Time flies !

112
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,320
Darling, I'm almost done.

113
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,160
Yeah, let's go.

114
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,120
It's OK, I'll go alone,
the car's here.

115
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,280
Sure ? You don't mind ?

116
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,820
We can at least see you out.

117
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,880
Did you know Adrian and I
have the same birthday ?

118
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,740
Really ? What a pair !

119
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,380
Of course business is slow !

120
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,440
I'm crazy about you.

121
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,600
Just four more cars to sell and then
we get out of here. A year off.

122
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,440
You've become such a poet !

123
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,120
I get it from him.

124
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,800
I asked why he came to Spain
and guess what he said ?

125
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,840
That he wanted to read
some writer in the original.

126
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,000
Roberto Bolaño.
-Roberto Bolaño.

127
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,933
Have you ever heard such a thing ?

128
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,160
Bye, Adrian.

129
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,560
See you soon.

130
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,320
Take care.
-Yeah.

131
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,480
That's it. Two. Two.

132
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,080
With your index finger.

133
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,720
And the fingernail.

134
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,200
I told you wouldn't get
it straight off.

135
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,040
Yeah, what is it ?

136
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,440
Stop a second.

137
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,280
Yeah, I can talk.

138
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,257
Don't worry, Carlos.
The car will be in Candás in two days.

139
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,773
Adrian will bring it.
I trust him with my life.

140
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,000
Hey !
-Hey !

141
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,400
What floor ?

142
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,360
Hey !

143
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,760
Hey !

144
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,720
Did you want to ask me something ?

145
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,600
I think I've seen you somewhere.

146
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,300
You did. It's true.
4 hours ago.

147
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,880
Where are you from ?

148
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm Romanian.

149
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,400
But I live in Cordoba.

150
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,840
I see.

151
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,500
You ?
-I'm not from here either.

152
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,440
Do you have anything to do
with that band ?

153
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,520
Nunatak ?
Or something...

154
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,120
I saw they've got a concert here.

155
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,387
You've heard of us ?
Hardly anyone has.

156
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,240
I've got one of your CDs.

157
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,640
Really ? And ?

158
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,187
And I like it.
-You have good taste.

159
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,240
Can I have an autográf ?
-What did you say ?

160
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,173
An autograph ?
Sure I'll give you an autograph.

161
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,160
Your name ?

162
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,200
For Adrian.

163
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,600
Adrian.

164
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,860
Thanks. -You're welcome.
-Can I sit with you ? -Yeah.

165
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,040
It's... it's nice here.

166
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,100
The ritual and everything.

167
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,360
In Romania you do the same on
the night of Saint John ? -Yes.

168
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,760
But we call it the "Night of Sânziene".

169
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,400
Night of... ?

170
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,520
"Sân-zi-e-ne."
-Sâzâne... What ?

171
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,000
Impossible to say. How can you
understand words like that ?

172
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,400
It's not like Dutch.

173
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,700
Like they say: Dutch isn't a language,
it's a throat disease.

174
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,967
And what happens on that night ?

175
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,980
They say the gates of heaven open.

176
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,647
The other world comes
into contact with ours.

177
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,280
And the "Sin-zi-enele"
or whatchama call it ?

178
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,020
The Sânzienele are...

179
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,817
Say it in your language.
I'll get it eventually.

180
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,320
What did you understand ?
-Did you smoke something ?

181
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,360
Why did you come to Spain ?

182
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,380
For a change.
To learn Spanish.

183
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,860
I didn't have a clear goal.
No direct road to follow.

184
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,100
But what's your job ?
What can you do ?

185
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,340
Pick grapes, olives...

186
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,000
Change tires...
-Olives...

187
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,200
And ?

188
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,100
When it comes to me, I write.

189
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,580
Well, then ! Some kind of loser...

190
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,000
You act as if I've got
some terminal disease.

191
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,800
It's not that bad.

192
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:25,567
If I were a mountaineer, or a gymnast,
or a miner, it'd be no better.

193
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,240
What do you write about ?

194
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,260
I had to choose between
a story about smokers

195
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,660
And another one about suicides.

196
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,000
And ?
-I chose the suicides.

197
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,640
I did research. In the end,
I felt a real connection with them.

198
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,280
I knew it from start there is was
something wrong with you.

199
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,680
Thanks for making it clear.

200
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,620
I've got to get ready for the concert.

201
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,600
Bye ! Keep writing !

202
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,720
Thank you, Candás !
You're wonderful !

203
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,403
Enjoy the night of Saint John !

204
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,060
And now, the last song of the night !
Thank you !

205
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,640
Hey !

206
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,320
And your boyfriend ?

207
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,560
How are the suicides ?

208
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,060
What's the best method ?

209
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,700
Hard to say.

210
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:14,200
You can jump from high up,
but it's a gamble. You might survive.

211
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:20,240
You can jump in the Guadalquivir, but
have to fill your pockets with stones.

212
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,900
You can shoot yourself but
you might miss.

213
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,320
Hanging works best with steel cable,

214
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,780
it's safe, it doesn't break.

215
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,200
If it's about slashing your wrists,
you really need to know how to do it.

216
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,160
I wouldn't suggest it.

217
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,240
Pills are better.
-Pills ?

218
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,840
50 pills.
-Won't it work with less ?

219
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:46,440
No, you need 50 pills, dissolved
ten at a time in a glass of water.

220
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,760
But the best of all is throwing
yourself in front of a train.

221
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,040
Unless you care about
how you look afterwards.

222
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,440
There will be bits and pieces of you
spread over a 100 meter radius.

223
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,840
But at least it's certain.

224
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,520
What if I jumped into the sea ?

225
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,537
Not very heroic.
Want another idea ?

226
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,560
Would you jump in after me ?

227
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,720
No !
-No ?

228
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,120
I can't swim.

229
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,280
Run !
-What's up ?

230
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,900
Come on !
-You're crazy !

231
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,240
At least we'll have good luck all year.

232
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,960
You'll finish your book
and I'll be very famous.

233
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,560
What ?

234
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,880
Didn't we jump into the sea
after midnight ?

235
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,280
You'll see...

236
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,980
I'll dedicating it to you.

237
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,000
Dedicate !

238
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,120
How come a big man
like you can't swim ?

239
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,560
I swear I don't know.

240
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:45,743
I grew up in the mountains.
I first saw the sea when I was 14.

241
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,380
I just liked splashing around.

242
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,020
What if a big wave swept me away ?

243
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,560
I'd vanish.

244
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,840
But I'd have been
the main character in your book.

245
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,000
No ?
-No, no.

246
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,433
If you vanished,
there'd be a huge fuss the next day.

247
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,160
The police, the TV.

248
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:13,620
Headlines with
"Singer vanishes. Romanian guilty."

249
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,040
"Famous singer."

250
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,920
He probably raped her first.
-Raped ?

251
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,400
We're guilty until proven innocent.
That's how we're seen.

252
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,900
You love playing the victim !

253
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,920
You're not the only one who suffers.

254
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,320
I could write a book.

255
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,400
You're married ?

256
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,680
No.

257
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,480
Let's go somewhere warm.

258
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,880
Thanks !

259
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,660
See the woman at the bar ?

260
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,260
What about her ?

261
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,987
I saw someone dressed
just the same at the concert.

262
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,460
Perhaps it's the fashion round here.

263
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,040
I think women who dress like that
are crazy about making love.

264
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,460
Good in bed, so to speak.

265
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,680
And the others ?

266
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,520
One more cigarette ?

267
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,580
One more, then I'll go, it's late.

268
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,440
There's something else
about Sanziene.

269
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,160
What ?

270
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:48,900
If you roll naked
in the morning dew as the sun rises,

271
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,590
you'll be beautiful and loved all year.

272
00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:00,437
Right now I wouldn't roll in the dew
not even for a million euros.

273
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,600
I have to go.

274
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,000
Hello.

275
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,000
Morning.

276
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,400
Morning.

277
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,680
You slept well ?

278
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,080
Like a baby.

279
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,840
Truth is that I've a strange
relationship with hotels.

280
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,080
Meaning ?

281
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,940
I stayed 10 months in a hotel room.

282
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,733
My dad was a security guard there.

283
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,400
What did you do all day ?

284
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,480
Write.

285
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:09,040
That's where I got the idea
to write about the dead.

286
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,880
How do you mean ?

287
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,813
It was full of pensioners,
there for treatment.

288
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,800
So it wasn't a hotel.
More like a spa center, right ?

289
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,200
Something like that.

290
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,700
I'm going.
I've a concert.

291
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,240
I'd like to see you again.

292
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,880
Think we could get a coffee together ?

293
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,280
I can't. I have to go.

294
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,720
Hey !
-Hey !

295
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,547
"Happy birthday ! Wish I was with
you..." Cristina.

296
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,880
Adrian...

297
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,480
Happy birthday !

298
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,540
You shouldn't have. Thanks.

299
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,040
You're welcome.

300
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,840
Open it. It won't explode !

301
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,760
T-shirts.

302
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,880
You like them ?

303
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,647
I'm totally predictable, right ?

304
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,830
You caught me unprepared.
Wait a minute.

305
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,400
It's a mess here.

306
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,167
Shall we go to the living room ?

307
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,040
Let's.

308
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,000
Rafa said you spend all day
in the trailer, writing.

309
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,480
I'm curious, what do you write about ?

310
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,880
Does it matter ?

311
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:26,180
I mean there is nothing
to blow you away.

312
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:30,620
It's nothing spectacular.

313
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,560
Don't be so modest.

314
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,493
You, writers, always
see the world differently.

315
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,080
Look around.

316
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,080
I swear you could write pages about
this trash and turn it into a story.

317
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:47,080
You could really imagine it as
a sort of magical place.

318
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:51,660
You mean, turning this place
from a cemetery into...

319
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,140
a place where the rats, dogs,

320
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,820
cats and locusts talk among themselves

321
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,640
and come up with the idea
of starting a war against people !

322
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,040
See ? I was right.

323
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,320
Cheers.

324
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,460
I swear I don't get
this attraction to writers.

325
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,900
Our lives are so dull !

326
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,320
We're boring.

327
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,300
No. My life is boring.

328
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,760
And you ? Who are you really ?

329
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,540
I mean, besides Rafael
and your relationship.

330
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,160
A locust !

331
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,560
A migrant one.

332
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,640
That can fly for 2.000 km
without stopping.

333
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,780
But you can also be greedy
and ravaging.

334
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,560
Oh, no, then I'm wrong !

335
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,580
In Romania we have this game,

336
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,940
"Truth or dare". You know it ?

337
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,360
We have it as well !
"Beso, verdad o atrevimiento".

338
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,760
Want to play ?
-Sure.

339
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,240
Me first.

340
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:17,620
If you could go back in time,
what would you change ?

341
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,360
I wouldn't work for 15 years
in the same place.

342
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,320
I wouldn't live in the city.

343
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:29,253
I'd build a house
with a garden and a vineyard.

344
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,400
I'd find someone to teach me to fight.
For love. For my folks.

345
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,800
Ah, and I'd get a tattoo.

346
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,640
What kind of tattoo ?

347
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,573
You only get one question.
My turn.

348
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,440
What would you change ?

349
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:52,820
You know, when you're an immigrant,

350
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,580
you get suspicious.

351
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,940
You think everyone's out
to exploit you,

352
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,220
because you work your ass off

353
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,480
for almost nothing.

354
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:15,380
You're frustrated and screwed up.

355
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,340
If people are whispering and laughing,

356
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,500
you're sure they're laughing at you.

357
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,740
Have you ever thought Rafa
or somebody else

358
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,760
was exploiting you here ?

359
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,240
It's not about this.

360
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:39,863
Adrian, Mercedes, come here !
What are you doing ?

361
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,180
I don't know what came over me.

362
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:11,060
All those sleepless nights alone.

363
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,740
I dreamed of writing a book,

364
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,420
but I've not written a word.

365
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,060
You know my biggest fear ?

366
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,760
Getting sick.

367
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,160
I don't want to die here.

368
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,923
And I don't want anyone
in my family to die.

369
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:40,377
I feel a jolt of fear every time
someone calls from Romania.

370
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,900
Is my father dead ? My mother ?

371
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,260
It drives me crazy.
You see ?

372
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:59,400
Why don't you leave ?
Why torture yourself ?

373
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,620
For the  300 Rafael gives you ?

374
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,160
You wouldn't understand.

375
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,960
You can't go back ?

376
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,960
Hello !

377
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,360
Is Rafael there ?
-No.

378
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,800
Can I come in ?

379
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,980
No. Sorry.
Nobody can come in at night.

380
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,600
Wasn't there a Porsche Cayenne
for sale ?

381
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,480
No.

382
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,880
It was sold.

383
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,720
Ah, so it sold.

384
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,660
Listen, jerk. That car was mine.

385
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,160
Tell Rafael I want my money.
I'll be here for it on Friday.

386
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,480
I've had enough of calling
and looking for him. Get it ?

387
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,720
It's none of my business.
But I'll tell him.

388
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,320
Don't act smart, you Romanian.

389
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,060
I'll take you down with him.

390
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:45,343
Tell him Carlos is coming
for his money on Friday.

391
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,300
I miss you ! So much !

392
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,360
MARIA

393
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,960
I can't pay your whole salary.
You know the trouble we're in.

394
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,393
No matter who comes asking,
I'm not here.

395
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,360
"The number you have dialed
Is not available".

396
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,760
"Please leave a message".

397
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,840
Shoot, Rafa !

398
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,240
Rafa ?

399
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,640
It's not Rafa.

400
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,320
Maria ?

401
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,880
How are you ?

402
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,780
Fine... I miss you, too.

403
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,960
Where are you ?

404
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,440
Still on tour,
with the guys, in Salamanca.

405
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,080
It's endless...

406
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,680
I had a dream about you last night.

407
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,000
Really ?

408
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,480
What was it about ?

409
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,760
We were at a hotel in Asturias...

410
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,160
Again ?

411
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,940
And you had the room
next door and...

412
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,720
Oh, no ! That's silly...
We were both on a rusty ship,

413
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,520
making love, while some guys
were taking the ship apart

414
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,320
and selling it for scrap.

415
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,600
No way !

416
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:40,900
Yes. And we danced the bolero
as the ship went down.

417
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:45,140
"I don't want to die

418
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,620
without being with you."

419
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,520
Adrian, was Rafael here ?

420
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,380
No. I came last night
and didn't see him.

421
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,373
Is that Pilar ?
-Yeah, sleeping.

422
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,480
Rafael is crazy about her.

423
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,980
Yeah. When he's home.

424
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,680
Rafa, Rafa.

425
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,080
He vanishes into the night.
If only he'd say something.

426
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:38,120
If I call him, he doesn't answer or he
picks it up when he feels like it.

427
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,880
If I confront him,
he gets angry and we end up fighting.

428
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,000
It's not right.

429
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,320
I think he knows what he's doing.

430
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,240
I'm not making excuses,

431
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:50,000
but he's probably trying to sort out
something for the dealership.

432
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,720
I know he cares about you a lot.

433
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,570
I know.
But he's driving me crazy.

434
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:00,200
One minute, he wants
to move into a bigger house.

435
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,480
How could we afford it ?

436
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,880
The next, he wants to repair
the abandoned house in the country.

437
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:11,000
The other day, he said he wants to sell
everything and start farming lavender.

438
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,500
At least he wants to settle.

439
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,840
He's come to his senses.
It might all work out.

440
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,240
I'm tired, Adrian.

441
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:26,087
I love him but he involves us
in his impossible projects.

442
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,680
I'm scared. About tomorrow,
about the day after, about everything.

443
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,520
You see, that's why
I'm scared to go back.

444
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,520
I don't know
how I'd manage day to day.

445
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,960
I live for the moment.

446
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,360
It's easier for you.

447
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,160
I have a mother and grandmother
to take care of.

448
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,120
Plus a child. Two, in fact.

449
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,840
My grandmother started
mistaking me for my mother,

450
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,240
she's no idea who I am.

451
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,920
Want a beer ?

452
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,880
Yeah.

453
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,900
Besides that ? How are you ?
You seem well.

454
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,200
Yeah. Kind of.

455
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:33,123
Like Rafa says: I have
everything I need, besides money.

456
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,600
I started writing again.

457
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,380
Really ? Read me something.

458
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,920
Oh, no !

459
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,560
I'd rather sweep the grounds.

460
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,480
I don't like reading out loud.

461
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,640
Then I'll read.

462
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,920
But it's in Romanian.

463
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:58,020
Let me read it.
Then we'll see what I understand.

464
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:07,100
I translated some of them into Spanish.

465
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,800
As best I could.

466
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,220
Immigrating song ?

467
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:21,640
Look at me here,
in Córdoba of the three cultures,

468
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,760
all of them dying.

469
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:28,900
Me, a former runaway
dreaming of the Mediterranean,

470
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:33,060
its beaches with
the flattest stomachs in Europe.

471
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,087
"Mowgli, Mowgli,
what's up, you bird-brain ?"

472
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,120
"What are you looking for in Spain ?"

473
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,520
Salmon ! Salmon ! Salmon !

474
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,320
I dreamed of a barbeque
the size of a truck,

475
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:52,540
full of sizzling salmon,
perfect like American actors.

476
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:58,420
I dreamed of a girl
with salmon-colored labia

477
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,620
and I was so hungry.

478
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,240
But she taught me Spanish,

479
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:13,620
which was like
a plume of smoke over rusty cars.

480
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,600
Spanish of the immigrants,
of the romantic dogs,

481
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:22,320
of the night guards, Spanish
of the countries with no salmon.

482
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:27,580
Mowgli, Mowgli, one day we'll run
high with this trailer,

483
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,040
your "Romania",
with its pressed-sawdust walls.

484
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:33,140
We'll say salmon ! salmon ! salmon !

485
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:38,100
and we'll shake hands
like chickens learning to fly.

486
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:47,300
So you wrote a poem
about Mowgli and salmon ?

487
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,000
Incredible.

488
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,160
Rafa...

489
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,480
Hello, my darling !

490
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,200
Where did you get to ?
Your phone died ?

491
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,820
I was on a mission.
Top secret !

492
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,467
I'm looking for a castle for my queen.

493
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,640
Didn't you dream of a prince
when you were young ?

494
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,480
Here I am, prince of Asturias !
Well, Andalucía.

495
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,880
Come down, you're drunk.

496
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,400
And you ?

497
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,600
What's new ? You're strutting like
a rooster. Fuck anything in Candás ?

498
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,140
What kind of jokes are these ?

499
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,927
But look who's here.
It's Pilar !

500
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,640
I don't want to !

501
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,280
Let her sleep.

502
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,740
Want to go horse riding ?
You'll love it !

503
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:50,857
Rafa, calm down. You're not
going anywhere. You woke her up.

504
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,320
I'll wait for you at home.

505
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:15,120
What's her name ?

506
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,500
Who ?
-Mother Teresa !

507
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,080
Her name's Maria.
Is it really so obvious ?

508
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:24,640
You can see it a mile away.

509
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:29,073
And that means it's serious.
No more peace and quiet.

510
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,840
And you ? How are things ?

511
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,280
Shitty.

512
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:36,130
I spent all my money
just when I need it most.

513
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,400
Can I help ?

514
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,080
I've got some money.

515
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:45,847
Tomorrow night I need to pay a loan
for this place. I'm  1.200 short.

516
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,240
Wow. I don't have
that kind of money.

517
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,600
I thought you might need
two or three hundred.

518
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,240
And you call that money ?

519
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,007
When do you need it by ?
-Now.

520
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,240
Friday I get the cash from the Porsche.

521
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,423
Ah, right.
Carlos was looking for you.

522
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,720
He came here and asked
about the Porsche.

523
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:07,680
He seemed angry.
He'll be here Friday for the money.

524
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:12,030
Don't worry about, he's a clown.
I'll deal with him.

525
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,360
Rafa ?
-What is it ?

526
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:58,420
Do you think you could
give me a few days' holiday ?

527
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:01,580
Are you crazy ? Holiday ?

528
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,840
Did you smoke all that weed ?
What's got into you ?

529
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,680
I want to see Maria.

530
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,100
Why didn't you say, so ?

531
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,840
How many days ?

532
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,240
One week.

533
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,400
It's a lot.
Let me see what I can do.

534
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,120
Wait. Don't go.
There's something else.

535
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:21,420
I need a car and a full tank of gas.

536
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,320
A car from here ?

537
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:29,087
That's your responsibility.
You know they're not insured.

538
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,520
OK...

539
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,920
Thanks !

540
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:56,640
"I hear the Sanzienele have come back
and will be in Salamanca this evening."

541
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,880
"You ready ?"

542
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:03,813
"Of course ! I can't wait
to dance naked in the wet grass."

543
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:48,260
You know I've not made love
in months.

544
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,000
It shows.

545
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,400
What do you mean, it shows ?

546
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,947
What ?
Are there no women in Córdoba ?

547
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:03,280
Sure. I'm surrounded
just by women there.

548
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,360
Yeah ?

549
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,200
Kia.

550
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,600
Toyota,

551
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,120
Lancia.

552
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,520
Can I come in ?

553
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,920
Let me in !

554
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,930
Don't worry, I won't make a fuss.

555
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:23,000
I came to have a drink with you.
We're colleagues.

556
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,400
Not drinking ? Fine.

557
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,480
Still, let's smoke together.

558
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,040
Here.

559
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:38,280
You don't smoke ?

560
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,920
Whatever.

561
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:45,100
Read me a poem, then.
A love poem.

562
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,640
You came in the middle
of the night just to hear a poem ?

563
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:51,040
I'm honored.

564
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:55,460
One of those
you read to my wife.

565
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:58,500
She said you're romantic.

566
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:02,560
What do you want ?

567
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,800
What were you thinking ?

568
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:11,320
That you'd give her a good fuck
and she'd stay with you ?

569
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,720
You'd get married
and have your papers in order ?

570
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,240
Or you hope you'd make
a fortune with her ?

571
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,640
Only thing I want is
you to leave her alone.

572
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,460
You're so naive !

573
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:25,480
She'll milk you dry
and throw you away like a rag.

574
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,497
So you're just concerned about me ?

575
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,280
Don't act so cocky,
there's no need.

576
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,440
You really want to know
where she came from ?

577
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,600
The shit-hole I dragged her from ?

578
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:40,440
You're not the first or the last
to fall madly in love with her.

579
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:43,240
Life's not all love
and poetry, you Romanian !

580
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,840
There are other things.

581
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:48,480
We're not all priests,
singing and fucking all day.

582
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,800
Great. Anything else ?
-Yeah.

583
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,240
Look at my fist.

584
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:54,340
I could hammer your face
like a rock.

585
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:59,913
It doesn't matter how big you are.
You have no idea who Maria is.

586
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:08,060
This'll end badly, you Romanian !

587
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,000
Hello !

588
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,400
Where are you ?

589
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:22,600
I want to tell you something.
-A secret ?

590
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:25,360
Let me guess.
You'd like to move in together...

591
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,240
Not a bad idea.

592
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:32,340
I can offer you a large duplex
with a view of the highway.

593
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,840
Tell me the truth.
So we'll live in a trailer, right ?

594
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,120
Why not ?

595
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:45,660
A Chilean poet
who emigrated to Spain

596
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:49,980
lived for more than a year
in a trailer.

597
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,720
And I don't think
he lived alone all that time.

598
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:57,620
So living in a trailer
is what poets do, right ?

599
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,800
I think I love you.

600
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:14,880
You think ?

601
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:18,280
I love you ! There you go.
Clear and unambiguous.

602
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,680
Why didn't you tell me before ?

603
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:23,660
Well, I was busy with other things.

604
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,920
Welcome to Romania !

605
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,280
I like this "Romania"
of yours very much.

606
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:49,260
High population density.

607
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,080
But I like it.

608
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,480
And this ?

609
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,880
John Wayne.

610
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,840
Want a drink ?
-Always.

611
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:12,957
The National Library, right ?

612
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,400
The ceiling's pretty low.

613
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,560
And who's that ?

614
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,160
Leonora Carrington ?

615
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:33,240
Looks crazy.

616
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,697
Look at those two
playing ping pong.

617
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,600
Who is she ?

618
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,640
A great artist, you know !

619
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:45,907
She never explained
her work in public.

620
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:49,660
She said that mystery

621
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:54,620
lies in the things unsaid.

622
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,780
Things beyond words.

623
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:39,880
This way.

624
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:44,883
Take care, we're getting close
to a very dangerous area.

625
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,440
Ready ?

626
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:52,700
One, two...

627
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:55,440
Surprise !

628
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:14,120
We can turn this place into
heaven on earth. I've a few ideas.

629
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,480
Such as ?

630
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:20,140
Well, for the time being...

631
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:23,280
we could fuck.

632
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,640
Fuck ?

633
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:29,300
Fuck in every car.

634
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,720
But there are two hundred cars here !

635
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:36,737
Exactly.
We need to start right now.

636
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:35,720
Adrian.

637
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:36,840
Hello !

638
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:39,920
Keep your distance,
I don't want to give you my cold.

639
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,320
I'm immune, don't worry.

640
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:45,120
How are you ?

641
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:48,040
I brought you something.
It was sent to our address.

642
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,440
I think it's from Romania.

643
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:06,640
I don't believe it !

644
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:08,760
They published my book.

645
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:11,000
What book ?

646
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:14,980
I gave some friends
some of my scribblings

647
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:16,600
and look what happened...

648
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,560
You mean... Mowgli,
the salmon and all that ?

649
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:22,260
Incredible ! They never told me.

650
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:26,320
Your first book, right ?

651
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:29,613
I'm so pleased ! Congratulations !

652
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,520
What's the title ?

653
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:36,900
It's called
"Above man, the woman soars".

654
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:40,040
How do you mean ?

655
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:45,300
I dreamed one night
that I was in an aerodrome,

656
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:50,420
holding a burning book to my chest.

657
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:56,300
And a woman flew over me.

658
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,720
Really fast.

659
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,520
Like a locust.

660
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,700
Want to celebrate ?
-Yes.

661
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:13,440
Noroc !
-Noroc !

662
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,100
Strong stuff from Transilvania, no ?

663
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,600
What's up with you ?

664
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:36,000
You're driving me crazy
with your calls, firing off threats.

665
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:39,160
You threaten the guard,
call my ex-wife... What's up ?

666
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,840
My money. I don't want excuses.
I want my money.

667
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:44,600
I told you I'd give it you.
It's late, I know.

668
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,160
But did I ever not pay ?

669
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:49,880
Forget it. I'm not someone
you can make a fool of.

670
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:52,240
You don't have the money.
You spent it. Just say it.

671
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:53,680
It's not like that. Listen.

672
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:56,280
Next week, Wednesday,
you'll have it.

673
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:59,300
Just tell me you fucking spent it.

674
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:03,940
My share, Rafael.
You spent my share.

675
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,000
Let's do it like this.

676
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:16,400
Under certain conditions, I could
pretend I forget about my share.

677
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,800
Meaning I'll do you a favor.

678
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,797
But I need a favor in return.

679
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:24,760
A favor ?

680
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:27,040
Nothing much.

681
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:30,557
Just driving some cars
from here to there.

682
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:38,360
Can I help ?
-No.

683
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:45,040
It's better that way.

684
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:50,400
You didn't even notice
I brought you a present.

685
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,800
A present ?

686
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,360
What's this ?

687
01:10:55,460 --> 01:11:00,043
A talisman. To protect you
from those who wish you evil.

688
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:04,400
Good thing it doesn't sing.
That's all I need.

689
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,800
Wait !

690
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:12,803
I want to send my mum
a photo of the fridge.

691
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,760
She'll calm down
and see I'm doing OK.

692
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:17,320
And how lucky you are
that you met me !

693
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,720
One, two...

694
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:30,560
Yes.

695
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:34,040
I have problems with this fucking
Carlos. I don't know what to do...

696
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,480
What happened ?

697
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:38,200
I told you I don't like this guy.
He's dangerous.

698
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:41,400
It's about a Mercedes with
some stuff... I need your help.

699
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,000
You're the only one I trust.
-I don't know what to say.

700
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,240
You have to do it.

701
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:47,920
Deliver it straight at the address
and split. No complications.

702
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:51,900
I told you I'm done.
No more shit like this.

703
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,200
It's not my business
you spent all the money.

704
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,600
Please ! I'll pay you well.

705
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:01,720
What's up ?

706
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,280
Nothing.

707
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:09,380
What is it ?
Who is that guy ?

708
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,600
No one.

709
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,180
So what does Rafael want now ?

710
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:16,440
He's in some trouble.

711
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:19,290
I don't like how Rafa treats you.

712
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:28,553
What can we do ?
We can't spend our whole lives here.

713
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:33,860
I'll work, I'll make money,
it'll be OK.

714
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,880
And until then ?

715
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:40,480
How do we live on what
Rafa gives you ? I don't have a job.

716
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:42,880
I don't know what we'll do.

717
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:45,320
Don't be a pessimist.

718
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,720
We'll find a solution.

719
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,160
Why don't we go to Romania ?

720
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:57,520
I could finally see
that Sangeorz of yours.

721
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:59,940
Think I wouldn't like to ?

722
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,880
You can show me the spa center,

723
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:04,920
the resort.

724
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:07,900
The meadow of the Sânziene.

725
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:02,640
Hey ! Hey !

726
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,840
Who's there ?

727
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:08,320
Catch him !
Quick !

728
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:24,420
Bastard ! Motherfucker !

729
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:28,300
Don't run ! Asshole !

730
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:32,040
You could have been so relaxed,
but, no, you were curious.

731
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:34,640
What did you think it was inside ?
An elephant ?

732
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:38,320
Rafa, this isn't funny at all.
They weren't kidding.

733
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:41,240
So, what do you want me to do ?
I told you to be careful.

734
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:44,800
I should've stayed away
and listened to Maria.

735
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:48,560
Well, well, now you we have
to ask Maria for all !

736
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:51,960
I want my money for the trip.
For this transport. Fuck it !

737
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,720
You know I'm a man of my word.

738
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:57,653
OK but when ?
I can't live on promises anymore.

739
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,440
I'll take care of it. Sell some stuff.

740
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:02,873
Sell what ?
There's nothing left to sell.

741
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:06,680
Trust me ! for God's sake.

742
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,960
Yeah, there on the left.

743
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:22,920
There's a stone.

744
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:26,060
We'll make paella there.

745
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:30,540
Who wants wine ?
-Me, please.

746
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:34,240
There's beer in the fridge.

747
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:38,660
How are things, Maria ? What are
you up to ? -Not much. But it's fine.

748
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,240
That's what happens if Adrian
keeps you locked away among the cars.

749
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:43,720
He thinks everyone's like him.
Always with their nose in a book.

750
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:46,640
It's not like that.
Last night we visited Córdoba.

751
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:49,040
What do you mean ?

752
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:51,600
I told you never to leave
the dealership at night.

753
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,080
We left for an hour, Rafa.
That's all.

754
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:54,840
Come on, Rafa, don't be ridiculous.

755
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:57,440
That place was left for nights
on end and nothing happened.

756
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:59,760
You could leave the gates open
and nobody would go in.

757
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:03,000
What could happen ? -Ok, leave it.
He's right. -Of course I'm right.

758
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,960
If you were paying him properly
you might have a point.

759
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:07,080
What did you say ?

760
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:09,840
If you were paying him properly
you might be right.

761
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:13,960
So this woman here thinks I'm
exploiting a poor immigrant ? -Maybe.

762
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,520
What's up ?
-Nothing.

763
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,900
But nobody else
would get out of bed

764
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,967
for the shitty  300 you pay him.

765
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:26,040
I'm not responsible for anyone's life.
If he doesn't like it, he can leave.

766
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,920
I'm not keeping him there, understand ?

767
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:30,080
Rafa, calm down.
-I am calm. It's her.

768
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:31,480
She suddenly stands up
for human rights

769
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,840
because her man doesn't give
her what she needs.

770
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,080
Let's calm down.
-Rafa, stop it, man.

771
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:38,640
We're calm.
Just one more thing.

772
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:41,860
Then we eat and have fun.

773
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:45,640
Loads of fun.
You want to ruin my day ?

774
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:47,320
Me ?
-Want to ruin everyone's day ?

775
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:49,040
Why would I want to ruin your day ?

776
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:51,320
You don't get that she's the one
ruining the day !

777
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:52,920
You get your first sniff
of pussy for months

778
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,760
and let her walk all over you.

779
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:56,920
If you care about Adrian,
come and live with him for good.

780
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:59,380
Who do you think you are, speaking
like that ? You think you know me ?

781
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:02,880
Must be nice to fuck a Romanian
and live off your husband, isn't it ?

782
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:05,960
Come and live with him, snob,
instead of giving me lectures.

783
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:08,380
Moron !
-Unionist ! Poser !

784
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:11,040
What the fuck !

785
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:23,880
What's got into you ?

786
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:26,120
Why are you like this ?

787
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:28,520
With me, with Maria ?

788
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:32,320
She's right. You should pay me.
-You'll get it in a week.

789
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,720
No. Not a week.

790
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:37,520
Today.

791
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:41,840
What the hell is going on ?
What's the thing with Adrian ?

792
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:44,600
He reads you a poem and then it's:
Adrian this, Adrian that.

793
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:47,040
"What a great guard you've got !"
He bent you over, too ?

794
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:49,720
Rafa, if you don't calm down,
I'll leave.

795
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:52,740
And I won't come back.

796
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:21,900
Come on kids, let's eat.

797
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:24,960
I don't know what's got into him.

798
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:28,060
Adrian, you know he's not like that.

799
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:30,840
Let's eat.

800
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:41,320
I'm a fool.

801
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:44,600
I'll pay you this evening
when we get back.

802
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:47,780
Adrian, I'm sorry.

803
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:54,700
It's a shame.
This paella is delicious.

804
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:57,160
It was made with love.

805
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,360
It's good.

806
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:20,593
Listen. Everything you can see here
has been mine for a week now.

807
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:23,600
I want to bring this place to life.

808
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:28,760
You started with a bang !
-I've already said I'm sorry, OK ?

809
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:32,960
I'll end things with the dealership
and renovate the house.

810
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:37,900
I'd like us all to move here.

811
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:41,437
With the kids, with everyone.

812
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,440
I'll sort out the washing machine
today. I'll go with Rafa to change it.

813
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:27,880
It's not about the washing machine.
It's everything. This isn't a life.

814
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:32,147
We're locked up
day and night in this shitty place.

815
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,080
So what do we do ?

816
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,360
We leave this dump.

817
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:40,400
Maybe you can live like this.
But I've had enough.

818
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,180
You want to leave now ?
-Yes !

819
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:45,840
Right now ?

820
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:50,020
We've still got cars to try out !

821
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:54,340
I'm serious.
Let's go to Madrid !

822
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,640
We can stay with a bandmate
until we find something.

823
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:59,140
Maybe I'll get a few concerts.

824
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:02,320
Don't think it's a good plan ?

825
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:04,860
No, it's great !

826
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:36,920
Hello.

827
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:39,860
I'm looking for Adrian.

828
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:13,760
What are you doing ?

829
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:16,160
I came to see you.

830
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,800
I brought you something.

831
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:21,680
A surprise for Christmas.

832
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:33,000
My mum didn't make zacusca,
but there's everything else.

833
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,620
Sausages and cabbage rolls.

834
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:39,480
And the fruit-cake turned out
really good. You have to try it.

835
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:41,000
Cristina !

836
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:44,280
And your dad sent plum brandy.
-Cristina, stop a minute !

837
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:46,680
What ?

838
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:55,240
How are you ?

839
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:57,640
Ok ? You settled in ?

840
01:23:57,860 --> 01:24:01,240
I made room for you
if you want to move your things in.

841
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:03,640
Maria, let me explain.
-I don't want you to explain anything.

842
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:06,440
I just want to smash
your stupid Romanian face in.

843
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:08,800
She just appeared here,
what could I do ?

844
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,220
Ah, now I see.

845
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:15,400
He says it's your fault you came.
-What's she saying ?

846
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,880
You forgot to tell me you have a wife?
-I tried, but...

847
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:22,200
Who is this woman ?
-I'm speaking to him now ! OK ?

848
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:24,520
Once I'm done,
he can tell you what he wants,

849
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:27,440
but for now this is
between me and him.

850
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:29,480
Why didn't you tell me the truth ?

851
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:30,600
I was a fool.

852
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:32,440
That's a shitty excuse.
I don't give a damn !

853
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:35,080
Maria, forgive me.
There's nothing between me and her.

854
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:36,880
No, no ! You listen !

855
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:39,720
I left everything for you,
I left my life behind

856
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,600
just to come in this shitty dealership.

857
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,440
And what do I find here ?

858
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:45,840
Fuck you !

859
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:49,680
Maria, I want us to live together, but
let me solve this the way I know how.

860
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:53,280
I don't want you
to solve anything. Moron !

861
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:04,520
What is this ?

862
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:08,763
I carry cabbage rolls
across Europe for you.

863
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:15,217
I thought you were all alone, that
we'd celebrate the holidays together.

864
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:21,120
I came here because I love you, and you
tell me there's nothing between us ?

865
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:23,720
There hasn't been for a while.

866
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:26,120
Oh, yeah ?

867
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:30,760
Don't tell me
you were happy with me back there.

868
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:33,160
Yeah, I was.

869
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:36,080
What was missing ?

870
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:27,160
"The number you have dialed
is turned off or out of service."

871
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,580
"Please leave a message."

872
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,520
Please, come back.

873
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:39,120
I love you !

874
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:36,920
I'll keep it.

875
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:40,660
But you need
to give me an autograph here !

876
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:45,880
No.

877
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:52,860
I'll write you something...

878
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:57,320
right on your skin.

879
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:03,640
You wrote a poem ?

880
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:06,300
No. I'm not that cool.

881
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:11,540
It's by De Ory,
a poet who's from this area.

882
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:19,480
Read it to me.

883
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:24,900
They live the horizontal dance

884
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:29,100
And no longer wander at night

885
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:34,100
They are possessed by desire
and say nothing

886
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:38,380
They don't write letters anymore

887
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:43,700
They leave, run and fly

888
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:47,820
Together, always together

889
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:11,240
Leave it, you're suffocating her.
Come on, we've got things to do.

890
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:13,040
I need to ask you something.

891
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:15,560
I need you to take this car right away.

892
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:19,280
I can't do it, I've got an appeal
in the case for Rafaelito's custody.

893
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:22,360
Where should I leave it ?
How do I get back ?

894
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:23,800
Come back by bus.

895
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:26,200
I've written it all down,
it's in the car. I drew you a map.

896
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:29,000
Rafa, I'm not sure I can.
I don't like it.

897
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:31,120
You think I like it ?

898
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:32,960
It's the last time
I'll ask you anything.

899
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:36,727
Then it's over.
With the cars and everything.

900
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:55,887
Hey, you looking for something ?

901
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:58,400
Hello !

902
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:02,920
Do you have the key
to the bathroom ?

903
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:05,320
Here.

904
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:11,000
Thanks.

905
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:30,000
Hey !

906
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:40,080
My God.

907
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:47,320
Oh God, I fucked it.

908
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:59,680
Oh, I fucked it.

909
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:06,700
Answer the phone, Rafa !

910
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:12,120
I'm fucked !

911
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:14,800
Answer the damn phone !

912
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:28,440
God. Motherfucker !

913
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:31,280
We need to leave, now !
Pack this !

914
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:33,880
I'll tell you later, Mercedes.

915
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:40,440
Can I help ?
-No !

916
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:51,680
Come in. Come in !

917
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:59,400
Adrian, what's going on ?

918
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:20,520
Stay here.

919
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:22,920
No ! Adrian !

920
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:29,960
Rafa, where are you ?

921
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:08,020
Get into the car.
Don't be scared.

922
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:15,560
Where's Rafa ?

923
01:38:15,660 --> 01:38:18,920
To turn off the lights
and call the police.

924
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:21,320
Where's Maria ?

925
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:24,120
Rafael, where are you ?

926
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:35,300
Come out, you bastard.

927
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:01,480
Hey, stop !

928
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:40,440
It's me.

929
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:14,720
Rafa...

930
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:17,120
Look at me !

931
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:23,360
Here...

932
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:29,360
Come quickly...

933
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:33,960
Rafa !

934
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:37,960
Look at me !

935
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:28,260
PARKING
