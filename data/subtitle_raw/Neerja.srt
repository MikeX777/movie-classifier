2
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:22,035
Live long and happy lives!

3
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,775
My blessings are with you!

4
00:02:16,056 --> 00:02:18,973
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

5
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,296
Four plates of special Biryani.

6
00:02:21,369 --> 00:02:22,400
Yes.

7
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:27,556
Here you are.

8
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:43,504
- I've seen 'Anand' seven times.
- Really?

9
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:44,723
That too at the theaters.

10
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:45,973
I remember every
dialogue from that film.

11
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:49,452
- Wow... bless you my 'mureed'.
- Who is 'mureed.' my name is Neerja.

12
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:51,848
Oho! Mureed means fan. Fan.

13
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,483
Just like I am a fan of Dilip Kumar.

14
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,192
And I am Rajesh Khanna's.

15
00:02:56,296 --> 00:02:58,410
May God bless you with a long life.

16
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:02,233
Life should be big, not long.

17
00:03:02,452 --> 00:03:06,858
Well said! Goodbye.

18
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,546
Hi!

19
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:11,733
- Yes.
- Will you have some?

20
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:13,608
Sister's here!

21
00:03:13,681 --> 00:03:15,556
- Sister's here!
- Go get ready.

22
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,254
- Hi Laado (DARLING)!
- Hi brother.

23
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:19,796
Thank God you are here.
It's a very boring party.

24
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:22,254
- Hi my 3D.
- So sorry I'm late.

25
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,598
Daddy's darling daughter!

26
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:26,848
Hi daddy!

27
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:32,129
Why are you so late?

28
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:34,744
Everyone has been
asking "Where is Neerja?"

29
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:38,275
Why are you eating samosas?
Are you hungry?

30
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,535
Did you eat the fruit
I packed for you?

31
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:43,390
- Yes.
- I had packed flat bread for you.

32
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:45,858
She must have eaten nothing!

33
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:52,192
See! She didn't eat?

34
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:55,275
Look at her.

35
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,150
Look.

36
00:03:57,265 --> 00:03:59,213
Good evening everybody!

37
00:03:59,494 --> 00:04:03,483
Today, the boys and
girls of Navjeevan society...

38
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:05,671
are going to dance...

39
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:09,629
to our favourite superstar
Rajesh Khanna's song!

40
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:13,150
Everyone's favorite superstar
or YOUR favorite superstar!

41
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:14,712
- Mine too.
- mama not fair!

42
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,827
My favorite! Everyone's favorite!

43
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:18,983
Rajesh Khanna the super star's song!

44
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:21,858
Look at your son!

45
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:24,963
Sweet!

46
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:30,942
"Bye-bye!"

47
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:33,546
"Bye-bye!"

48
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,660
"Bye-bye miss, goodnight.
We'll meet again tomorrow."

49
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,317
"Bye-bye miss, goodnight.
We'll meet again tomorrow."

50
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:49,640
"The day was colorful,
the dazzling night has arrived."

51
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,994
"The day was colorful,
the dazzling night has arrived."

52
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:59,619
"Bye-bye miss, goodnight.
We'll meet again tomorrow."

53
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:04,754
"Bye-bye miss, goodnight.
We'll meet again tomorrow."

54
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:06,317
Those were the kids!

55
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,671
For Navjeevan society!

56
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:09,629
That was amazing!

57
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:13,619
And now a special
performance by my parents!

58
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:15,212
They are going to sing!

59
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:18,973
They want you to sing, not me!

60
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:21,504
You haven't clicked
a single good snap of me!

61
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:25,577
Click their snap!

62
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:31,796
"My heart has been crazy since childhood."

63
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:39,379
"Love is the reason for life."

64
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:44,171
"The flowers didn't impress me,
I never enjoyed a nap in a hammock."

65
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:49,452
"The flowers didn't impress me,
I never enjoyed a nap in a hammock."

66
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:54,535
"I found solace
in the softness of your tresses."

67
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:57,765
"Bye-bye miss, goodnight."
- OK, dad. That's it! Enough flirting!

68
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:00,338
And now...

69
00:06:00,546 --> 00:06:02,275
a special act!

70
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:04,921
Our society's Robot-boy!

71
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:49,129
"Bye-bye miss, goodnight.
We'll meet again tomorrow."

72
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:52,129
"Bye-bye!"
- "Bye-bye!"

73
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:54,556
"Bye-bye!"
- "Bye-bye!"

74
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:05,546
He is here.

75
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:09,213
- He is here.

76
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:11,410
Go down.

77
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:34,900
- Hello!
- Hello!

78
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:47,973
Quickly!

79
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:53,400
Put it on the table.

80
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:57,400
Good evening.

81
00:07:57,473 --> 00:07:58,858
Good evening.

82
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:07,785
She loves posing for snaps!

83
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:12,098
Don't bother.

84
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,942
Everyone kept waiting
for you to liven up the party.

85
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:06,702
Hold it carefully.

86
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:13,692
Careful.

87
00:09:18,869 --> 00:09:20,463
Did you see mama dancing today?

88
00:09:21,098 --> 00:09:23,150
- She was having great fun!
- You mimic!

89
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,265
I had to compete with you, right?

90
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:28,567
She's perfected the dance step.

91
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:29,806
Go to bed now.

92
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,879
- Please wake me up in a while.
- Go get some sleep. Don't you get tired?

93
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,723
Oh, Nikki!

94
00:09:35,796 --> 00:09:38,369
Why don't you take sick leave?

95
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:40,275
I can't...

96
00:09:40,348 --> 00:09:41,525
Shanti is also on sick leave...

97
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:43,744
and this is my first
flight as Head Purser.

98
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:44,723
Wow!

99
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:46,567
I'm not giving you this.

100
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,744
I'll read it on the flight.

101
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:49,317
Read it when you come back.

102
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,879
You won't die if you don't read it.

103
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:52,890
You're so mean.

104
00:09:52,963 --> 00:09:55,254
Papa, I never got back
the last magazine I gave her.

105
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,900
Look Laado,
they're showing your commercial.

106
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,358
Which one?

107
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:00,921
You look like an aunty!

108
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:12,775
These are 4 AK47s,
8 grenades and bullets.

109
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:15,421
Safarini will wear the explosives belt.

110
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:18,640
Fahad and Mansoor,
be careful with the grenades.

111
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:21,223
And these clothes are for you.

112
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,160
Rama!

113
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,171
It's 1 o'clock.

114
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:34,702
If you let her sleep some
more then she'll get late.

115
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:39,265
I have to complete this article.
You wake her up.

116
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,994
Laado!

117
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:16,140
- It's 1 o'clock.
- Let me sleep.

118
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:21,421
Okay sleep, dear.

119
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:23,369
You still have some time.

120
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:32,723
Your modeling career
is going so well...

121
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:36,150
do you have to work so hard?

122
00:11:36,473 --> 00:11:39,942
Why don't you quit
your job as an air hostess?

123
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:41,890
I like my job.

124
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:44,285
That's the problem.

125
00:11:48,046 --> 00:11:49,015
You know...

126
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:52,077
when your plane takes off...

127
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:54,296
so does my blood pressure.

128
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:58,046
My blood pressure comes
down only when your plane lands.

129
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:03,275
You ate three samosas yesterday...

130
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:05,358
that's why your
blood pressure's high.

131
00:12:06,223 --> 00:12:08,338
Don't blame my plane.

132
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:14,494
Oh my baby!

133
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:17,369
- By the way...
- Huh?

134
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:20,088
Did you tell Karim bhai to
pick you for the airport?

135
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:21,796
Jaideep's coming.

136
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:24,327
Okay.

137
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:27,140
I've switched on
the water heater, dear.

138
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:28,921
Come on.

139
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:38,744
Come on.

140
00:12:57,452 --> 00:12:59,442
Pack the guns.

141
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:11,421
We will work hard.

142
00:13:11,494 --> 00:13:13,265
We are prepared.

143
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:18,660
We will do anything to
succeed in our mission.

144
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:22,619
We will definitely emerge victorious.

145
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:35,296
- One more...
- mom.

146
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,765
- Just a little more...
- ma, please.

147
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,910
Only a little.

148
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:41,619
- Where's your ring?
- Don't know. Can't find it.

149
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,327
What do you mean you can't find it?

150
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:44,827
Mom, I looked everywhere.

151
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:47,431
I told you never
to take that ring off.

152
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:48,713
Did you look under the pillow?

153
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:50,806
I promise I searched the entire room.

154
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,088
It's not there.

155
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:57,827
- Check the bathroom.
- mom... I've checked everywhere.

156
00:13:59,702 --> 00:14:01,265
It's not here either.

157
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:04,119
You keep flitting
around like a busy bee.

158
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:07,765
You get so many things done in a day...

159
00:14:07,838 --> 00:14:09,681
but you can't take
care of a single ring.

160
00:14:09,994 --> 00:14:12,806
I got it specially
made for your safety.

161
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,681
My sweet mom.

162
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,702
If this happened
then that wouldn't happen.

163
00:14:16,806 --> 00:14:18,921
If that happened
then this wouldn't.

164
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:22,504
Eventually what has to happen
will happen. Understood?

165
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:24,650
Wow!

166
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:27,504
What film is this dialogue from?

167
00:14:28,556 --> 00:14:31,577
My child!
It's an original dialogue.

168
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:34,535
Stop spoiling her.

169
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:36,921
Wait, Laado.

170
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,577
I've made rolls!

171
00:14:42,358 --> 00:14:44,463
Don't give all of it away.
Keep some for yourself too.

172
00:14:44,546 --> 00:14:45,556
Okay.

173
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:48,088
Bye, mom!

174
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:49,546
Oh... my vanity case.

175
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,765
Okay, bye.

176
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:57,608
Laado... your birthday's on the 7th.
You won't be here!

177
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:59,108
I'll celebrate in Frankfurt!

178
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:01,223
But don't forget to
get my birthday present.

179
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:03,348
Tell me what you want!

180
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:05,671
You remember to yell
at me but you forgot this?

181
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:08,483
- I want that yellow dress.
- Yes, of course.

182
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:10,088
I remember now.

183
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,306
I'll definitely get that dress, dear.

184
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:14,213
- Bye!
- Bye!

185
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,077
Aunty, you take good care of uncle.

186
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,140
I made a big mistake.

187
00:15:34,452 --> 00:15:36,567
Jaideep is the right boy for Laado.

188
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:40,181
I wonder why I got her
married to Naresh.

189
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:51,994
Will Mansoor and Fahad
be able to do their jobs?

190
00:15:52,421 --> 00:15:56,723
- Yes, they have been properly trained.
- They're both good.

191
00:15:57,015 --> 00:15:59,963
We will hijack the
plane and meet in Cyprus.

192
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:02,890
In exchange for the passengers...

193
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:05,452
we will get our
brothers out of jail.

194
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:08,233
May God protect you.

195
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:17,650
- Good bye!
- Good bye!

196
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:19,181
May God protect you!

197
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,858
See you in Cyprus!

198
00:16:27,702 --> 00:16:31,213
"Oh my dream girl, when will you come?"

199
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:34,379
"The weather is so fine,
when will you come?"

200
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:36,452
I'm being really honest...

201
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:37,983
when you're not here...

202
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:40,765
I miss your voice the most.

203
00:16:40,838 --> 00:16:42,390
But you don't like my voice, do you?

204
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,181
I listen to your voice with my heart,
not my ears!

205
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,473
Oh really!

206
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:47,713
I really miss you.

207
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:49,317
"Gently.. gently.."

208
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,338
You can also say,
"Jaideep, I also miss you".

209
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:54,181
"The gentle breeze.."

210
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:56,681
"I miss you... mademoiselle."

211
00:16:57,838 --> 00:17:06,598
"my persona began to soar."

212
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:12,212
"Oh fragrant.. mesmerizing love.."

213
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:17,494
"Deep, immersive love."

214
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,140
"I'll wrap myself in these thoughts."

215
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:32,588
"I'll connect to those memories."

216
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,629
"Oh fragrant.. mesmerizing love.."

217
00:17:37,702 --> 00:17:39,723
"Deep, immersive love."

218
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:41,379
Now slow down... stop here!

219
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:44,754
Hey I'm a good boy.
I don't like where this is going.

220
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:46,358
Please don't waste time,
just look at that.

221
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:47,598
What do you think?

222
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:50,483
Who's that?

223
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:52,056
Can't you see?

224
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,431
That's you?

225
00:17:54,598 --> 00:17:56,056
No it's someone else.

226
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,900
That can't be you.

227
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:00,015
Very funny.

228
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:02,619
The photographer must
have worked some magic.

229
00:18:02,723 --> 00:18:05,015
I thought...
since I am not here on my birthday...

230
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:07,660
if you missed me...
you could come here.

231
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:09,671
But you look really
nice with makeup.

232
00:18:09,744 --> 00:18:12,379
Thanks. Fine, let's go. Forget it.

233
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:13,494
- Take me to the airport.
- Listen...

234
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:14,744
- I have to report at 2.30...
- Listen!

235
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:15,921
What?

236
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:19,723
You look beautiful as a bride,
mademoiselle.

237
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:24,088
"Gently.. gently.."

238
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,963
"the gentle breeze.."

239
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,754
You look beautiful as a bride,
mademoiselle.

240
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:35,358
It's 2:27am... 3 more minutes to go.

241
00:18:35,577 --> 00:18:37,098
What do you need 3 minutes for?

242
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:39,598
These 3 minutes are
very important for me.

243
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,848
Okay.

244
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:43,171
Your idol Rajesh Khanna is
going to do me a huge favor.

245
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,671
In three minutes?

246
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:46,275
Okay.

247
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:52,775
- What's this?
- Your birthday present.

248
00:18:58,827 --> 00:18:59,473
I'm opening it.

249
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,108
- Not yet...
- Why?

250
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:03,244
- Open it on your birthday.
- No, I'll open it now.

251
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:04,973
No! For my sake!

252
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:07,338
- And..
- Hi, Jaideep.

253
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,723
- Hello...
- HI.

254
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:09,827
Tina, unfortunately..

255
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,056
only we have to deal with
grouchy company drivers.

256
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,004
You're right.

257
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,879
I wish our pickup was as cute.

258
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:17,348
- Okay, guys, come on let's go.
- And he's blushing by the way.

259
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:18,567
Let's go.

260
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,171
- Sorry, bye.
- Bye.

261
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:21,619
Bye, Jaideep!

262
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,702
Bye, Jaideep! See you!

263
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,431
Jaideep is so cute!
I think you should marry him.

264
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:29,369
Marry him,
or else she'll steal him from you.

265
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:31,213
She has the hugest crush on Jaideep.

266
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,640
Excuse me, sir.

267
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,962
Excuse me, sir. Sorry.

268
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,504
Let go of the past.

269
00:19:36,671 --> 00:19:37,775
That was an arranged marriage.

270
00:19:38,723 --> 00:19:39,931
He loves you.

271
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:45,713
You should consider giving
life another chance.

272
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:57,796
Jaideep!

273
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,775
I'll miss you.

274
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:06,765
I'll miss you too.

275
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:10,317
Bye.

276
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,629
I'll open this on my birthday.

277
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:23,171
If they stop us,
do as you've been told.

278
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,035
ID, Sir?

279
00:20:37,463 --> 00:20:40,379
He's a diplomat from Libya.

280
00:20:40,598 --> 00:20:42,504
We are here to see him off.

281
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,296
Sorry sir.

282
00:20:52,723 --> 00:20:53,785
Come on...

283
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:55,525
Okay Sir.

284
00:20:56,785 --> 00:20:57,723
Let them through!

285
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,890
Are all systems checked
and serviceable?

286
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:07,317
Checked and serviceable.

287
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:21,983
Hi, Zone 4. All equipments
checked and serviceable.

288
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:23,306
Thank you so much.

289
00:21:26,473 --> 00:21:28,827
Debina, I'm going up to
the pilots to let them know.

290
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,181
- Debrief?
- Yes.

291
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:34,254
- Hi, Samarth. All okay?
- Yes Neerja, everything is fine.

292
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:38,848
Hello.

293
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,608
Good morning, Captains.
I'm Neerja Bhanot.

294
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:42,150
I'm your Head Purser today.

295
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:44,160
- Good morning.
- Hey Neerja. How are you?

296
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:46,275
Very well, Captain.
I haven't learnt my French yet.

297
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,848
We flew last weekend
to Paris together.

298
00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:50,869
Okay, you know each other.

299
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,119
I'm Capt. Snipes.

300
00:21:52,473 --> 00:21:53,483
Very nice to meet you, Captain.

301
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,348
This is my first
flight as Head Purser.

302
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,327
- Wow! Congratulations.
- Thank you.

303
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,754
Let us know if you need anything.

304
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:00,254
Captain, this is for you.

305
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,067
Great. That's your staff list.

306
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:05,254
And we'd just love it if you could...

307
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:07,025
get some tea up here
once we're in the air.

308
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,858
Sure.

309
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:09,108
Indian habits, huh!

310
00:22:09,223 --> 00:22:10,254
- See you.
- Bye.

311
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,004
We're ready to board.

312
00:22:16,108 --> 00:22:17,317
Hi, we're ready to board.

313
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:31,046
- Hi, Neerja.
- Yes.

314
00:22:31,713 --> 00:22:33,129
These are the Unaccompanied
minors traveling to Frankfurt.

315
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:33,785
Hello.

316
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,910
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you doing?

317
00:22:35,015 --> 00:22:35,952
Careful, careful.

318
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,910
He's scared of flying.

319
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:40,994
Really? Why?

320
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:44,119
Because I've seen on television...

321
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,796
that sometimes planes crash.

322
00:22:49,056 --> 00:22:51,681
I thought I'll introduce
you to the pilot...

323
00:22:51,796 --> 00:22:54,192
- but, since you're scared...
- No... I'll meet the pilot.

324
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,338
I won't be scared.

325
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:56,379
Fine.

326
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,546
Mom, I will sit with my dad.

327
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:03,504
Emergency Exit Lights.

328
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:04,973
- Auto.
- Auto.

329
00:23:05,838 --> 00:23:07,233
Oxygen masks.

330
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:09,275
Normal.

331
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,442
- What's your name, dear?
- Tina!

332
00:23:11,504 --> 00:23:12,192
Debina.

333
00:23:12,306 --> 00:23:14,806
- Both of you look really beautiful.
- Thank you.

334
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:16,713
- This is my grandson Rahul.
- Yes.

335
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:18,067
- Hello.
- Are you married?

336
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:20,056
- No, not yet.
- Grandma, please.

337
00:23:20,577 --> 00:23:22,004
I'll talk to you later.

338
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:24,775
17D and 17E. Here.
Right here.

339
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:25,202
Thank you.

340
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:26,796
May I see your boarding
passes, please.

341
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,265
- Come on.
- Let me speak.

342
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:35,556
- I want a blanket.
- We're not sitting in a bus, dear.

343
00:23:35,629 --> 00:23:36,838
I want a blanket.

344
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,056
Maintain some discipline, dear.

345
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:38,713
May I help you sir?

346
00:23:38,796 --> 00:23:40,379
30... 30...

347
00:23:40,463 --> 00:23:42,994
- 31. Your seat.
- Yeah okay, thank you.

348
00:23:43,098 --> 00:23:44,452
- May I help you sir?
- Thank you.

349
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:45,431
Please let me know.

350
00:23:47,588 --> 00:23:48,900
Put on your seat belts.

351
00:23:49,223 --> 00:23:49,567
Hello.

352
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:51,129
- Hello.
- Mr. Malone. 13J.

353
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:53,317
- I'll lead you to your seat.
- Oh, that's so...

354
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:54,327
Mr. Malone.

355
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:00,817
Oh look honey, I think it's her.

356
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:05,588
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Goldstein.

357
00:24:05,692 --> 00:24:07,567
I'm Neerja Bhanot.
I'm the Head Purser today.

358
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,713
If you need anything,
please let me know.

359
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,598
- May I ask you something?
- Sir?

360
00:24:11,671 --> 00:24:15,035
- Is this you?
- Yes, sir.

361
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:17,129
- That's a beautiful picture.
- You are very beautiful.

362
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:18,296
Thank you.

363
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:20,910
Sir your blanket.

364
00:24:21,296 --> 00:24:22,369
Thanks.

365
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:28,733
You are flying with
us till Frankfurt, is it?

366
00:24:28,942 --> 00:24:30,608
Yes, we are going
to see you in Frankfurt.

367
00:24:30,723 --> 00:24:32,796
Perhaps. Great enjoy your flight.

368
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,546
I don't have patience
like your mother. Hold this.

369
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:46,077
Since you are seated at the emergency
exit, it's important to brief you.

370
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,233
Please do not open the
door till the orders are given.

371
00:24:49,348 --> 00:24:51,150
- Is everyone aboard?
- All passengers on board.

372
00:24:51,265 --> 00:24:52,754
- Have a safe flight Neerja.
- Thank you.

373
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:54,181
Thank you so much.

374
00:24:58,317 --> 00:25:03,702
Welcome aboard Pan Am 73 to
New York, via Karachi and Frankfurt.

375
00:25:04,473 --> 00:25:06,160
But you know I always love
being back here in India...

376
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:07,108
Sir, please keep your seat upright.

377
00:25:07,181 --> 00:25:11,660
in fact, I'm in the middle of an
intensive course in Hindi lessons.

378
00:25:12,494 --> 00:25:13,817
So... here goes.

379
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:18,088
Hello, Ladies and Gentlemen.

380
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:19,900
My name's Capt. Jack Snipes.

381
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:23,442
It's now 4 a.m.

382
00:25:23,515 --> 00:25:27,442
And we should be arriving in Karachi
in about an hour and 20 minutes.

383
00:25:27,723 --> 00:25:29,556
One small favor.

384
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:32,442
By the time we reach Frankfurt,
if you could let me know...

385
00:25:32,556 --> 00:25:34,629
how my Hindi is.

386
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:38,525
He likes to talk a lot in Hindi.

387
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,681
Have a good flight.

388
00:25:56,817 --> 00:25:57,567
What's this?

389
00:25:58,275 --> 00:25:59,171
What's this?

390
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,983
Love letter?

391
00:26:02,963 --> 00:26:04,035
Did Jaideep give you this?

392
00:26:04,317 --> 00:26:06,160
Jaideep has asked me to
open it on my birthday.

393
00:26:06,473 --> 00:26:07,577
Open it.

394
00:26:08,556 --> 00:26:10,640
How will he know that
you opened it on your birthday or not?

395
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,494
- No!
- Show Na!

396
00:26:13,775 --> 00:26:16,202
It's a matter of principle.
I don't want to open it.

397
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:19,233
Why is everything a matter
of principle for you?

398
00:26:19,473 --> 00:26:21,379
- How many principles can one have?
- Stop it.

399
00:26:21,452 --> 00:26:22,775
He's looking at us.

400
00:26:34,598 --> 00:26:35,285
Give it back.

401
00:26:37,577 --> 00:26:39,171
No chance,
I don't have a magazine.

402
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,608
I need some reading material.

403
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,119
Please.

404
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:46,890
Fine, I'll open it.

405
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:49,494
I'll be the first one to read it.

406
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,931
Don't be mean, please give it back.

407
00:26:54,577 --> 00:26:55,754
Okay... one condition.

408
00:27:01,046 --> 00:27:02,921
Promise me you'll marry Jaideep.

409
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:07,296
Thank God you left Naresh.

410
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:15,285
Is your mother like this too?

411
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:17,963
Does she make your father
order take-outs all the time?

412
00:27:18,525 --> 00:27:20,056
No, my mother's a good cook.

413
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:21,473
I see... she's a good cook!

414
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:24,223
You could've learnt something
from her before marriage.

415
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:27,598
Or maybe in trying
to make you independent...

416
00:27:27,671 --> 00:27:29,015
she didn't teach you anything.

417
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:32,629
I'll learn everything soon,
don't worry.

418
00:27:32,702 --> 00:27:33,921
No, I'm not worried.

419
00:27:37,015 --> 00:27:38,515
You know what the problem is Neerja?

420
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:43,056
We don't get paid to look pretty.

421
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:45,494
We have to work hard.

422
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:47,796
Do you know what "hard work" is?

423
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:54,838
And... look! How my hard-earned money...

424
00:27:55,442 --> 00:27:56,504
is being wasted!

425
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:08,567
But don't worry.

426
00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:12,702
Give me your hand.

427
00:28:14,723 --> 00:28:15,556
What's the amount on the bill?

428
00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:18,160
45 Riyal.

429
00:28:18,275 --> 00:28:20,629
45 Riyal. Hold this. Eat it.

430
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:22,681
Eat it.

431
00:28:24,046 --> 00:28:28,942
I'll recover this 45 Riyal
from your darling Daddy.

432
00:28:33,848 --> 00:28:35,306
Oh yes, you're vegetarian.
Throw it.

433
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:37,181
Throw it.

434
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:44,504
Where are you going?

435
00:28:47,921 --> 00:28:49,692
To serve your friends.

436
00:28:52,473 --> 00:28:53,504
You stay here.

437
00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:56,358
Don't come out, understand?

438
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:58,588
Who is going to clean all this?

439
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,494
Me?

440
00:29:00,713 --> 00:29:01,775
Should I call someone else?

441
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,285
Then do it.

442
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:09,910
Good for nothing...

443
00:29:13,463 --> 00:29:16,317
Dad, I don't think I can make it.

444
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,900
It's taking me some
time to adjust here.

445
00:29:20,973 --> 00:29:24,858
So I think if I stay and
spend some time here...

446
00:29:24,942 --> 00:29:27,744
without coming back,
then I might adjust better.

447
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:30,108
Did anyone at home
say something to you?

448
00:29:31,473 --> 00:29:34,213
Should I have a word with Naresh?

449
00:29:34,285 --> 00:29:36,650
No! Please don't talk to Naresh.

450
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:40,463
He knows. He suggested that...

451
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:43,077
actually,
we both took a joint decision...

452
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,890
that I should stop modeling.

453
00:29:47,463 --> 00:29:48,921
Look, dear...

454
00:29:49,129 --> 00:29:52,348
remember what I've been teaching
you since you were a kid.

455
00:29:53,088 --> 00:29:54,119
Listen to me.

456
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:57,317
First of all, stay strong.

457
00:29:58,098 --> 00:30:00,796
Stay strong... it solves every problem.

458
00:30:00,983 --> 00:30:02,015
Yes.

459
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:03,963
And second...

460
00:30:04,213 --> 00:30:06,879
don't ever do or
tolerate anything wrong.

461
00:30:07,963 --> 00:30:09,067
And third...

462
00:30:11,202 --> 00:30:13,525
Yes... remember the first two statements.

463
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:15,608
You have to be a brave girl.

464
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:17,556
Now come on tell me...

465
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,296
Who is my brave girl?

466
00:30:23,192 --> 00:30:24,650
Who is my brave girl?

467
00:30:26,806 --> 00:30:28,192
Who is my brave girl?

468
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,254
Once more.

469
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:28,838
Do it properly.

470
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:29,848
Khalil!

471
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,494
Why are your hands shaking? Coward!

472
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:41,640
- Don't be scared.

473
00:31:41,952 --> 00:31:44,233
You just need to follow the plan.
That's all.

474
00:31:44,525 --> 00:31:46,077
Come on, try again.

475
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:55,608
Be brave.

476
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,619
You have trained hard for this day.

477
00:31:57,869 --> 00:31:59,108
Be brave.

478
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:02,702
Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen.

479
00:32:02,806 --> 00:32:05,723
We will be landing at Karachi
International Airport shortly.

480
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:08,702
Please make sure your tray tables
and seats are in the upright position.

481
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,827
Also make sure your seat
belts are correctly fastened.

482
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,952
- Sir... please put your seat belt on.
- Thank you.

483
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,108
Quick!

484
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:23,379
The plane is landing.

485
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:42,004
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

486
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:44,817
Ready.

487
00:32:47,535 --> 00:32:50,692
Fahad, Mansoor, both of
you will enter from the rear gate.

488
00:32:50,973 --> 00:32:53,713
Khalil, you've to control the cockpit.
It's time.

489
00:32:54,244 --> 00:32:55,275
I know.

490
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,379
Good morning, we have arrived
at Karachi International Airport.

491
00:32:58,796 --> 00:33:03,275
Passengers flying en-route to Frankfurt
and New York, please remain seated.

492
00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:06,713
All those deboarding in Karachi,
thank you for flying Pan Am.

493
00:33:13,983 --> 00:33:15,535
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

494
00:33:15,931 --> 00:33:17,140
How are you Mr. Imran?

495
00:33:17,254 --> 00:33:18,077
Sign on this.

496
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:18,983
All fine?

497
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:22,421
All good.
And I have a special gift for you.

498
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:23,223
As always.

499
00:33:23,681 --> 00:33:25,754
Thank you.
I'll go see the pilots.

500
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:26,900
How are you?

501
00:33:30,181 --> 00:33:30,869
May I come in, sir!

502
00:33:31,088 --> 00:33:33,588
- Who's there?
- Sir, Imran Ali. Radio Engineer.

503
00:33:34,494 --> 00:33:35,806
- Good morning, Pilot.
- Good morning.

504
00:33:36,025 --> 00:33:39,869
- Sir, any interference in the radio?
- No. Everything is good.

505
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:42,098
Okay, sir. Have a nice journey, sir.

506
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:42,963
Thanks.

507
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:49,223
- Fahad.
- Shoot! Now! Come on!

508
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,806
- What's wrong?
- Rajesh Khanna again?

509
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:13,171
I like Amitabh Bachchan more.

510
00:34:13,244 --> 00:34:14,004
How many times...

511
00:34:18,046 --> 00:34:19,254
Shoot!

512
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:20,817
Fast, fast, fast!

513
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:25,306
Come on, fast!

514
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:27,254
Close the door!

515
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:28,119
Close the door!

516
00:34:28,223 --> 00:34:29,473
Close the door!

517
00:34:30,348 --> 00:34:31,587
Close the door, Debina!

518
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,515
Hold on, Grandma.

519
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:48,973
Hey move back!

520
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:51,369
Move! Move!

521
00:34:51,473 --> 00:34:52,973
Come on! Move!

522
00:34:53,046 --> 00:34:55,504
- Down! Down!
- move it! Move it!

523
00:34:58,504 --> 00:34:59,369
Shut up!

524
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,202
Sit down! Sit down!

525
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:03,431
Down! Down!

526
00:35:03,504 --> 00:35:04,400
No one moving!

527
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:14,275
No one!

528
00:35:15,254 --> 00:35:16,983
- Everyone keep quiet!

529
00:35:22,171 --> 00:35:23,483
- Hello.
- Hijack.

530
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:25,046
What?

531
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:26,994
Hijack.

532
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:30,713
Phone down.

533
00:35:30,785 --> 00:35:31,723
She said hijack?

534
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:35,098
There is no cockpit in the front!

535
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:36,317
What?

536
00:35:36,452 --> 00:35:37,244
Cockpit?

537
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:39,462
- Cockpit?
- Upstairs. Upstairs.

538
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,796
- Let me go and check.
- No, no, wait.

539
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:43,160
We will follow protocol.

540
00:36:00,713 --> 00:36:01,369
Open the door.

541
00:36:01,483 --> 00:36:03,421
- What about the passengers?
- We don't have time.

542
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,775
We cannot leave them.

543
00:36:05,754 --> 00:36:06,765
Captain!

544
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:09,296
Open the door.

545
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:11,369
Open the door!

546
00:36:15,244 --> 00:36:16,004
Move it.

547
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:17,775
Open it!

548
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:19,129
It can only be opened from the inside.

549
00:36:21,494 --> 00:36:24,129
It is the right thing to do,
because it's protocol.

550
00:36:24,212 --> 00:36:25,702
- But the passengers...
- That is an order.

551
00:36:26,296 --> 00:36:27,358
Open the door!

552
00:37:12,692 --> 00:37:15,327
How did they escape? Huh?

553
00:37:15,785 --> 00:37:18,598
- I don't know.
- Did you signal them? Huh!

554
00:37:20,754 --> 00:37:24,608
They are all going
to die because of you.

555
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:26,317
Get up!

556
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,629
Get up! Everyone, go down.

557
00:37:33,098 --> 00:37:34,202
Go down!

558
00:37:39,463 --> 00:37:40,879
Hurry up.

559
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:44,900
Move!

560
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,390
Move! Move!

561
00:38:43,275 --> 00:38:44,140
Move!

562
00:38:48,004 --> 00:38:49,869
The pilots escaped.

563
00:38:50,254 --> 00:38:51,431
How did they escape?

564
00:38:52,171 --> 00:38:53,410
They escaped from the cockpit.

565
00:38:53,525 --> 00:38:55,890
Where? How?
We were standing down here!

566
00:38:55,963 --> 00:38:58,463
Even you didn't know
that the cockpit was upstairs.

567
00:38:58,598 --> 00:38:59,879
So don't blame me for this.

568
00:38:59,952 --> 00:39:01,275
What were you doing?

569
00:39:02,942 --> 00:39:04,713
This is hijack!
This is hijack!

570
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:05,796
- Get up.

571
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,035
No one moving.

572
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:08,702
This is a hijack!

573
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:09,952
You... hands up!

574
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:11,379
You... hands up!

575
00:39:11,463 --> 00:39:12,181
Hands up.

576
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,504
Everyone hands up!

577
00:39:13,723 --> 00:39:14,890
What happened?

578
00:39:14,973 --> 00:39:17,369
Pilots have escaped from the plane!

579
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:19,556
What should we do now?

580
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,421
- The pilots will come back!

581
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,119
Bring everyone to the middle section!

582
00:39:30,025 --> 00:39:33,421
Come on! Do it now!

583
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,129
Move! Move!

584
00:39:38,088 --> 00:39:41,275
- Hurry up! Move!

585
00:39:42,983 --> 00:39:44,963
Come on! Move!

586
00:39:45,317 --> 00:39:47,369
Move ahead!

587
00:39:47,577 --> 00:39:48,504
Move! Move!

588
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,723
- Move it!

589
00:39:51,046 --> 00:39:52,296
- Move up!

590
00:39:55,223 --> 00:39:57,723
Come here!

591
00:39:58,765 --> 00:39:59,796
Back! Back!

592
00:40:00,504 --> 00:40:01,921
Go back!

593
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,390
Get up!

594
00:40:04,463 --> 00:40:05,400
Get up!

595
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:07,244
Get up!

596
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:17,077
Move! Move! Move!

597
00:40:17,285 --> 00:40:19,025
Move! Move! Move!

598
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:20,244
Move! Move!

599
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:21,077
Sit.

600
00:40:22,744 --> 00:40:24,067
- Okay.
- Down!

601
00:40:29,348 --> 00:40:30,452
Move! Move!

602
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:36,119
- Sit!

603
00:40:36,202 --> 00:40:37,171
You. Sit.

604
00:40:37,275 --> 00:40:39,150
Sit! Sit! Sit!

605
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:43,983
- Move! Move inside!

606
00:40:47,494 --> 00:40:48,598
Come on!

607
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:57,567
Shut up!

608
00:40:58,858 --> 00:40:59,692
Hands up!

609
00:40:59,765 --> 00:41:00,483
Hands up!

610
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,463
Hands up!

611
00:41:04,077 --> 00:41:05,244
Hands up!

612
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:06,504
Hands up!

613
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,192
I'll get back to you with the details.

614
00:41:10,254 --> 00:41:12,275
- Yes, Captain.
- Hijack. My plane's been hijacked.

615
00:41:12,483 --> 00:41:14,463
Hijacked? Saad, clear this crowd.

616
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:16,546
Please sit down.

617
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,567
Please come into my cabin,
let's talk there.

618
00:41:18,702 --> 00:41:19,879
Please, this way.

619
00:41:19,952 --> 00:41:21,577
This side.
Please come.

620
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:24,994
Rehman, re-route
all planes via Lahore.

621
00:41:25,098 --> 00:41:26,171
- Yes sir.
- This side.

622
00:41:26,598 --> 00:41:28,879
- Excuse me sir, please don't hurt her.
- Sit down!

623
00:41:28,963 --> 00:41:29,962
Rahul, sit down.

624
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,452
- Sit down!
- One second!

625
00:41:32,535 --> 00:41:33,296
Sit down.

626
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:34,348
Sir please sir.

627
00:41:35,254 --> 00:41:37,296
Who do you think I am?

628
00:41:37,681 --> 00:41:39,410
Who do you think I am?

629
00:41:39,525 --> 00:41:40,588
- Sorry! Sorry!
- Who do you think I am?

630
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:42,202
- Look at me!
- I said sorry!

631
00:41:42,306 --> 00:41:43,171
Look at me!

632
00:41:43,244 --> 00:41:44,213
Look at me!

633
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:47,306
I am an American!
I'll show you my passport!

634
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:50,192
Stay there!

635
00:41:54,088 --> 00:41:55,681
How will we reach Cyprus?

636
00:41:56,588 --> 00:42:00,233
- If the plane doesn't take
off they are no good to us.

637
00:42:01,421 --> 00:42:02,910
- Brother!
- Shut up!

638
00:42:03,025 --> 00:42:05,410
- Let's kill all of them here
if we can't reach Cyprus.

639
00:42:05,629 --> 00:42:10,942
- Their dead bodies will
get our brothers released from jail.

640
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:13,379
Kill them all!

641
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:18,171
We have to keep these
passengers alive.

642
00:42:19,285 --> 00:42:22,202
That's the only way to get the pilots.

643
00:42:25,785 --> 00:42:26,796
Sit.

644
00:42:27,806 --> 00:42:28,733
Sit here.

645
00:42:28,983 --> 00:42:30,608
- So did you leave the engine running?
- Yes.

646
00:42:30,723 --> 00:42:32,556
Yes, we followed protocol,
so we left the engine running.

647
00:42:32,671 --> 00:42:34,202
- Great!
- We evacuated the cockpit.

648
00:42:34,546 --> 00:42:36,421
My passengers are on board.

649
00:42:36,494 --> 00:42:38,192
There's over 300 passengers.

650
00:42:38,296 --> 00:42:39,577
What do we do now?

651
00:42:40,108 --> 00:42:41,004
You, get up.

652
00:42:41,431 --> 00:42:42,223
Announcement!

653
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,015
- Announcement!
- I... I... I'll make the announcement.

654
00:42:46,088 --> 00:42:47,546
I'll make the announcement.

655
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:50,077
- I...
- Sit here!

656
00:42:52,171 --> 00:42:53,379
Announce!

657
00:42:57,244 --> 00:43:00,390
Everyone... silent.

658
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:03,317
Silent... otherwise kill everyone.

659
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,806
I am Neerja Bhanot.

660
00:43:08,785 --> 00:43:11,171
I'm the Head Purser on this flight.

661
00:43:11,629 --> 00:43:14,785
Our pilots are not
in the cockpit right now.

662
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,483
We do not have any pilots.

663
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:22,296
Everyone please stay calm
and cooperate with them...

664
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:23,963
and I promise nothing
will happen to you.

665
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:30,150
They have no enmity with any of you.

666
00:43:34,504 --> 00:43:39,087
- Please... lower your hands.
- No!

667
00:43:39,296 --> 00:43:40,202
No hands down!

668
00:43:40,306 --> 00:43:41,692
No hands down!

669
00:43:42,108 --> 00:43:44,025
- Hands up!
- Up. All up!

670
00:43:44,442 --> 00:43:45,900
I am trying to help you.

671
00:43:45,973 --> 00:43:48,504
If they stay calm and cooperate...

672
00:43:49,723 --> 00:43:53,358
and if they are reassured,
then it'll make things easier for you.

673
00:43:53,546 --> 00:43:55,004
Please understand.

674
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:57,223
Please.

675
00:43:58,765 --> 00:44:01,119
Let the passengers lower their hands.

676
00:44:01,296 --> 00:44:04,254
Please... please put your hands down.

677
00:44:05,785 --> 00:44:08,379
Hands down! Hands down, everyone.

678
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:12,213
Sir, there are
approximately 44 Pakistanis...

679
00:44:12,285 --> 00:44:14,952
Did I ask you how many
Pakistanis are on board?

680
00:44:15,338 --> 00:44:16,619
What do you want me to do?

681
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:19,712
Go up there, check their passports.

682
00:44:20,202 --> 00:44:21,869
Save the Pakistanis...

683
00:44:22,223 --> 00:44:23,681
and offer my regrets to the rest?

684
00:44:23,963 --> 00:44:25,171
Sorry, sir.

685
00:44:26,327 --> 00:44:27,713
Give me that!

686
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:33,515
Arrange for a van
to go to the tarmac.

687
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:34,525
Okay, sir.

688
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:36,785
- And...
- Yes, sir.

689
00:44:36,858 --> 00:44:38,202
I want a camera on the roof.

690
00:44:38,452 --> 00:44:40,296
I want photographs of the hijackers.

691
00:44:41,931 --> 00:44:43,035
Sit up.

692
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:54,640
My name is Inzamam.

693
00:44:56,004 --> 00:44:58,119
I'm coming to help you out.

694
00:45:03,723 --> 00:45:05,379
Are you hearing me?

695
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:08,546
I'm coming to help you out.

696
00:45:09,212 --> 00:45:13,338
We should ask for pilots...

697
00:45:13,556 --> 00:45:16,327
Otherwise we'll shoot the passengers.

698
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,577
Whatever your demand..

699
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,098
I will try to fulfill your demand.

700
00:45:24,546 --> 00:45:26,619
Shutter down! Shutter down!

701
00:45:26,973 --> 00:45:28,108
You shutter down!

702
00:45:28,327 --> 00:45:30,723
Shutter down! Shutter down!

703
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:34,202
Shutter down! Shutter down!

704
00:45:36,463 --> 00:45:39,275
Shutter down! Down!

705
00:45:39,379 --> 00:45:42,567
Shutter down! Down!

706
00:45:43,379 --> 00:45:44,588
Quickly!

707
00:45:44,806 --> 00:45:45,702
Come on!

708
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,671
Let the ladies and children go.

709
00:45:51,931 --> 00:45:56,306
- Brother! How will we talk to them?
- We shouldn't open the door.

710
00:45:56,483 --> 00:46:00,515
- We need a radio operator
to talk to people at the ATC.

711
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:02,660
Go... announcement!

712
00:46:03,473 --> 00:46:05,129
Radio operator... plane.

713
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:06,931
Radio operator.

714
00:46:10,108 --> 00:46:11,004
Announce!

715
00:46:11,077 --> 00:46:13,577
Is there a radio engineer
on our flight?

716
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:15,629
Radio engineer.

717
00:46:15,702 --> 00:46:16,317
Fast!

718
00:46:16,431 --> 00:46:18,827
Is there a radio engineer
on our flight?

719
00:46:19,983 --> 00:46:21,077
Radio engineer!

720
00:46:21,473 --> 00:46:23,838
I'm coming to help you out.

721
00:46:26,692 --> 00:46:28,035
Radio engineer!

722
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:30,983
Is there a radio engineer
on our flight?

723
00:46:31,098 --> 00:46:32,129
Radio engineer?

724
00:46:32,213 --> 00:46:33,119
Radio engineer?

725
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:34,879
Do we have a radio
engineer on our flight?

726
00:46:34,963 --> 00:46:36,067
Radio engineer?

727
00:46:38,681 --> 00:46:40,338
There is no radio
engineer on our flight.

728
00:46:45,213 --> 00:46:48,619
Until you talk to me..

729
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,379
how will I know what your demands are?

730
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,285
- Name...
- Sir... I...

731
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,785
I'm an American. I'm not an Indian.

732
00:46:58,213 --> 00:46:59,869
I'll show you my passport.
One second.

733
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,650
American!

734
00:47:01,723 --> 00:47:02,858
Yeah, one second. I'll show you.

735
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:04,463
Sir, sir, sir...

736
00:47:04,535 --> 00:47:05,640
Don't hit him!

737
00:47:11,004 --> 00:47:12,910
Sir, sir, sir... wait.

738
00:47:13,015 --> 00:47:15,681
Don't hit her. Don't hit her, sir.

739
00:47:15,942 --> 00:47:17,494
Don't hit her. Don't hit her, sir.

740
00:47:21,702 --> 00:47:22,713
- Brother!

741
00:47:23,379 --> 00:47:24,379
Take me instead.

742
00:47:25,213 --> 00:47:26,535
Sit there! Sit there!

743
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:31,921
- Otherwise I will kill you.

744
00:47:31,994 --> 00:47:32,785
Sit straight.

745
00:47:32,869 --> 00:47:33,692
Kill me.

746
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:34,733
American.

747
00:47:34,848 --> 00:47:35,535
Kill me.

748
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,098
- Shut up.
- Kill me. Kill me.

749
00:47:39,088 --> 00:47:40,098
Kill me.

750
00:47:40,306 --> 00:47:41,442
Let him go.

751
00:47:47,285 --> 00:47:48,494
Pilot...!

752
00:47:48,713 --> 00:47:49,723
Pilot...!

753
00:47:50,108 --> 00:47:52,358
We are unarmed!

754
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:54,442
- No arms!
- Pilot...!

755
00:47:54,692 --> 00:47:55,796
Kill!

756
00:47:57,713 --> 00:47:58,744
Send the pilot.

757
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:01,702
I will convey your
demands to my authorities.

758
00:48:01,817 --> 00:48:02,785
Pilot...!

759
00:48:03,556 --> 00:48:07,890
- The pilots will come.
- No! We have to talk to him.

760
00:48:08,806 --> 00:48:09,910
- Be patient.

761
00:48:10,817 --> 00:48:12,317
Please stay calm!

762
00:48:13,077 --> 00:48:14,108
30 minutes!

763
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,535
Pilot no...

764
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,973
- Kill!
- 30 minutes are less, brother!

765
00:48:19,546 --> 00:48:21,348
I'll speak to the
authorities on your behalf.

766
00:48:21,421 --> 00:48:24,338
I'm sure they'll
agree to your demands.

767
00:48:26,463 --> 00:48:27,598
30 minutes!

768
00:48:28,129 --> 00:48:29,483
- Just a little more time.
- 30.

769
00:48:29,765 --> 00:48:31,046
Give us a little longer, brother.

770
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,681
One passenger... kill!

771
00:48:32,858 --> 00:48:36,358
- I'm here to help you.
- 30!

772
00:48:36,744 --> 00:48:38,410
No pilot... kill!

773
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:39,869
- Kill everyone!
- They are innocent.

774
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:41,671
They are not at fault.

775
00:48:41,754 --> 00:48:45,463
- I kill! Everyone! 30 minutes!
- I am getting your demands processed.

776
00:48:46,379 --> 00:48:49,473
Give me a little time.
Please be patient.

777
00:48:49,535 --> 00:48:51,650
Stair... Van... move...

778
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:54,608
I'll get it moved.
I'll get it moved.

779
00:48:56,629 --> 00:48:57,983
There's...

780
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:03,431
some news that...

781
00:49:06,983 --> 00:49:09,483
some flight has been hijacked.

782
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:12,015
Hijack?

783
00:49:12,546 --> 00:49:13,827
Pan Am flight.

784
00:49:16,994 --> 00:49:18,796
Which flight was she on?

785
00:49:22,213 --> 00:49:24,494
Pan Am 73, but...

786
00:49:25,098 --> 00:49:26,160
You know what...

787
00:49:26,275 --> 00:49:27,660
Are you sure...

788
00:49:27,983 --> 00:49:31,525
I'll call our guy Ismail,
and confirm this...

789
00:49:31,598 --> 00:49:32,869
and check what's going on.

790
00:49:33,223 --> 00:49:34,369
I mean...

791
00:49:35,796 --> 00:49:36,869
let's not speculate.

792
00:49:36,983 --> 00:49:38,921
Give me five minutes, okay.

793
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,150
And I'll get back to you.
Just five minutes, you relax.

794
00:49:41,671 --> 00:49:42,775
Sit down.

795
00:49:44,765 --> 00:49:46,015
I'll be back in five minutes.

796
00:49:56,963 --> 00:49:58,733
How can you not send me the pilots?

797
00:49:59,265 --> 00:50:01,473
Sir, Karachi Airport
is your responsibility.

798
00:50:01,556 --> 00:50:02,619
See what is the best
you can do, but...

799
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,921
Pan Am can't risk
any of it's crew, sir.

800
00:50:05,483 --> 00:50:06,588
And what about the air hostesses?

801
00:50:06,702 --> 00:50:08,015
They are also a part of Pan Am.

802
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,671
What about them?

803
00:50:10,483 --> 00:50:11,629
What can I say!

804
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,192
That's our policy.

805
00:50:14,796 --> 00:50:17,088
Sorry. Excuse me.

806
00:50:49,765 --> 00:50:51,671
- Hello.
- Hello, Harish.

807
00:50:52,473 --> 00:50:54,202
I'm glad you called.

808
00:50:55,077 --> 00:50:56,952
I've been getting this
strange sinking feeling.

809
00:50:57,681 --> 00:51:00,119
Well... actually...

810
00:51:00,504 --> 00:51:03,796
Laado's plane which had
gone to Karachi...

811
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:08,244
has been hijacked.

812
00:51:10,723 --> 00:51:12,421
And... Neerja?

813
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,963
Neerja's... on board the flight.

814
00:51:16,077 --> 00:51:17,879
We... we...

815
00:51:18,858 --> 00:51:20,379
Mushtaq just informed me.

816
00:51:21,806 --> 00:51:24,921
Rama, don't worry.
I... I...

817
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:27,046
I mean...

818
00:51:29,348 --> 00:51:30,358
I'm still at the office.

819
00:51:30,775 --> 00:51:35,400
- Just look after yourself, I...
- Everything will be okay.

820
00:51:35,713 --> 00:51:37,890
Nothing will happen to our Laado.

821
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:41,931
- Don't worry.
- I... I'll call you...

822
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:11,473
- What if the pilots don't come?
- Wait.

823
00:52:13,285 --> 00:52:13,900
Open.

824
00:52:14,015 --> 00:52:14,702
Open!

825
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:18,317
Shut up! Shut up!

826
00:52:23,671 --> 00:52:25,129
- Please...
- Shut up, sit down!

827
00:52:25,379 --> 00:52:27,035
Sit down! Sit down!

828
00:52:27,285 --> 00:52:29,369
Sit down! Sit down!

829
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,848
Sit down! Sit down!

830
00:52:33,098 --> 00:52:35,150
Pilots! Pilots!

831
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,608
My team is trying to get you pilots.

832
00:52:39,213 --> 00:52:42,202
- Sit down! Sit down!
- Please be patient.

833
00:52:42,306 --> 00:52:43,588
30 minutes...

834
00:52:44,004 --> 00:52:45,400
30 minutes... over!

835
00:52:45,504 --> 00:52:47,556
Brother, they're almost here.

836
00:52:47,619 --> 00:52:48,796
30 minutes!

837
00:52:49,088 --> 00:52:52,035
No pilots! 30 minutes!

838
00:52:52,108 --> 00:52:53,983
Violence won't serve any purpose.

839
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:57,525
We'll solve the problem together.
Please be patient.

840
00:52:57,702 --> 00:52:58,713
Pilots!

841
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:01,035
I'm here to help you.

842
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,379
Shoot!

843
00:53:12,713 --> 00:53:15,598
The longer you take,
more people will die!

844
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:18,858
Move it!

845
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,098
Sit down!

846
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:24,744
- Down!
- Down!

847
00:53:58,452 --> 00:53:59,879
Open door!

848
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:10,275
Neerja... come on baby.

849
00:54:15,765 --> 00:54:16,900
Neerja...

850
00:54:20,598 --> 00:54:21,879
Neerja!

851
00:54:23,796 --> 00:54:24,660
Neerja!

852
00:54:28,213 --> 00:54:29,838
Will you call your father again?

853
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:33,692
Once again
Naresh is the bad guy, huh!

854
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:38,390
Who do you think you are?

855
00:54:39,015 --> 00:54:40,931
I've been keeping count.

856
00:54:41,765 --> 00:54:43,463
Been writing down every detail.

857
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:48,504
Every phone call... every food delivery,
I'll make your father pay for everything.

858
00:54:48,713 --> 00:54:49,723
Get it?

859
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,046
You just come out.

860
00:54:53,963 --> 00:54:55,317
Come out Neerja!

861
00:55:00,952 --> 00:55:02,129
Come out!

862
00:55:03,588 --> 00:55:04,838
Open the door.

863
00:55:07,483 --> 00:55:10,119
Stay strong... it solves every problem.

864
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,244
And secondly...

865
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:15,931
Don't ever do or tolerate
something that's wrong.

866
00:55:19,265 --> 00:55:20,817
Who's my brave girl?

867
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,129
Who's my brave girl?

868
00:55:26,598 --> 00:55:27,608
Me.

869
00:55:29,171 --> 00:55:30,671
Open the door.

870
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,640
Or I shoot!

871
00:55:41,202 --> 00:55:42,410
Why move?

872
00:55:43,254 --> 00:55:44,077
Why move?

873
00:55:44,463 --> 00:55:45,671
I tell you to move?

874
00:55:53,681 --> 00:55:56,379
We shot the wrong man.
Should've shot her.

875
00:56:24,608 --> 00:56:26,160
Tina! Debina!

876
00:56:30,765 --> 00:56:31,452
What?

877
00:56:31,671 --> 00:56:32,317
What?

878
00:56:32,608 --> 00:56:32,952
Water.

879
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,525
Go back.
No water. No water.

880
00:56:36,567 --> 00:56:37,463
Sir, please.

881
00:56:37,713 --> 00:56:39,098
No water!

882
00:56:40,494 --> 00:56:42,150
Sir, I am only doing my job.

883
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,765
I'm performing my duty,
just like you are.

884
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,744
Do it fast.

885
00:56:54,848 --> 00:56:56,129
Brother...

886
00:57:08,963 --> 00:57:10,421
Tough times, Inzamam.

887
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:11,942
Yes.

888
00:57:12,535 --> 00:57:13,858
Have you sealed the airport?

889
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:15,629
Yes, the airport has been sealed.

890
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:18,265
Sir... the terrorists are from ANO.

891
00:57:18,556 --> 00:57:20,494
- Abu Nidal Organization?
- Yes.

892
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:24,358
Sir, they will keep
the passengers hostage...

893
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,754
until their jailed comrades
in Cyprus are freed.

894
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,431
You'll have to stall them
for 2-3 hours till I get there.

895
00:57:30,858 --> 00:57:32,213
I'm trying my best.

896
00:57:32,525 --> 00:57:35,588
But they sound very
restless and nervous.

897
00:57:36,796 --> 00:57:39,858
Thankfully the pilots
managed to escape.

898
00:57:40,067 --> 00:57:41,765
All thanks to that Purser...

899
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:42,640
Neerja Bhanot...

900
00:57:42,713 --> 00:57:43,848
Neerja Bhanot...

901
00:57:44,098 --> 00:57:46,213
who gave them the Hijack
code at the right time.

902
00:57:54,421 --> 00:57:55,525
- Brother.

903
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:00,640
They are taking too long.

904
00:58:00,848 --> 00:58:02,098
Let's kill another hostage.

905
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:05,681
Let's kill her. She is trouble.

906
00:58:05,963 --> 00:58:09,077
No! She is not an American, plus she
is the only one who is able to function.

907
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,796
Get all the passports
from the passengers.

908
00:58:13,921 --> 00:58:17,015
First American passports, then others.

909
00:58:17,463 --> 00:58:18,494
- Okay?

910
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:23,160
Hey... come here.

911
00:58:36,473 --> 00:58:38,244
Make... Uhhh...

912
00:58:39,952 --> 00:58:41,796
Brother!

913
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,890
What's the word for 'Elaan'?

914
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,088
- Announcement.
- Announcement.

915
00:58:48,296 --> 00:58:49,577
Make announcement.

916
00:58:49,754 --> 00:58:52,713
Passports... of... all the passengers..

917
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,067
Collect.

918
00:58:55,108 --> 00:58:56,140
Quickly.

919
00:59:00,004 --> 00:59:02,296
We need your passports.

920
00:59:02,473 --> 00:59:04,171
We want your passports.

921
00:59:04,463 --> 00:59:08,348
Please keep your
passports ready with you.

922
00:59:08,598 --> 00:59:10,879
- Keep your passports with you.
- Passports!

923
00:59:11,056 --> 00:59:13,202
- Shut up! Shut up!
- We will come and collect them.

924
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:17,421
Only the cabin crew will come
and collect them.

925
00:59:17,494 --> 00:59:20,088
Only the cabin crew
will take your passports.

926
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,869
- Shut up!
- Please calm down.

927
00:59:22,983 --> 00:59:25,681
You'll be safe
if you cooperate with us.

928
00:59:26,046 --> 00:59:29,931
Please keep calm and cooperate
with us. Nothing will happen to you.

929
00:59:30,598 --> 00:59:31,598
Please listen to me.

930
00:59:32,265 --> 00:59:33,442
Please leave us!

931
00:59:41,473 --> 00:59:43,546
- No clever.
- For passports.

932
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:48,900
No American passports.

933
00:59:49,744 --> 00:59:51,515
No American passports.

934
00:59:52,598 --> 00:59:54,129
No American passports.

935
01:00:01,567 --> 01:00:03,223
No taking American passports.

936
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:09,098
No American passports?

937
01:00:09,317 --> 01:00:10,869
All passports!

938
01:00:11,327 --> 01:00:12,160
Passports!

939
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:13,963
Sir passports!

940
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:17,963
Sir.

941
01:00:29,442 --> 01:00:30,858
Ma'am, passport.

942
01:00:31,171 --> 01:00:32,452
Thank you.

943
01:00:40,348 --> 01:00:41,525
Will you return it?

944
01:00:48,629 --> 01:00:50,213
Move!

945
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:52,921
- Shut up!
- Do as they say.

946
01:00:53,765 --> 01:00:55,015
Your passport.

947
01:00:59,608 --> 01:01:00,671
Fast!

948
01:01:00,931 --> 01:01:01,994
Fast!

949
01:01:03,223 --> 01:01:04,233
Passports?

950
01:01:05,931 --> 01:01:07,358
Passports!

951
01:01:07,806 --> 01:01:09,129
Where passport?

952
01:01:17,233 --> 01:01:18,327
Passports?

953
01:01:24,254 --> 01:01:25,223
I'll get it.

954
01:01:26,963 --> 01:01:27,681
Move!

955
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,296
Move!

956
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:33,598
- Brother!

957
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:57,535
Yes.

958
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:58,723
Hello, Rama.

959
01:01:59,463 --> 01:02:02,681
The government is negotiating
with the terrorists.

960
01:02:03,452 --> 01:02:06,483
You know, when she returned
from her hijack training...

961
01:02:07,108 --> 01:02:08,598
I made it very clear.

962
01:02:08,806 --> 01:02:10,504
Forget your training and all that...

963
01:02:10,577 --> 01:02:15,171
if you're in danger,
just run for your life.

964
01:02:15,931 --> 01:02:17,806
But she never listens to me.

965
01:02:17,983 --> 01:02:20,827
- Rama, I hope Laado...
- I hope!

966
01:02:21,775 --> 01:02:23,358
What do you mean I hope?

967
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,629
Laado's going to be fine.

968
01:02:26,296 --> 01:02:28,681
She's absolutely fine.

969
01:02:28,931 --> 01:02:31,119
Absolutely... Absolutely...
She's absolutely fine.

970
01:02:31,994 --> 01:02:35,254
Harish... we had two sons...

971
01:02:35,983 --> 01:02:38,067
yet I kept praying for a daughter.

972
01:02:38,181 --> 01:02:40,119
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

973
01:02:41,588 --> 01:02:43,275
At the time of her birth...

974
01:02:43,463 --> 01:02:46,338
there was a threat to her life,
and mine too.

975
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:50,088
But... she didn't give
up and neither did I.

976
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:54,015
So... God finally had
to answer our prayers.

977
01:02:54,129 --> 01:02:57,879
- Yeah..
- So... who can snatch her from us now?

978
01:02:58,265 --> 01:02:59,588
Don't worry.

979
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:01,983
- Absolutely...
- 100 percent...

980
01:03:02,817 --> 01:03:05,910
- Okay.
- She'll come back...

981
01:03:06,681 --> 01:03:07,744
Just watch.

982
01:03:09,629 --> 01:03:11,650
She wants that yellow
dress on her birthday.

983
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,410
I'll go get that.

984
01:03:13,629 --> 01:03:14,733
Okay?

985
01:03:15,442 --> 01:03:16,681
She will definitely come back.

986
01:03:16,796 --> 01:03:17,900
Don't you worry.

987
01:03:19,608 --> 01:03:21,192
- What did papa say?
- Wait.

988
01:03:21,275 --> 01:03:22,973
- Where are you going?
- They have no news yet.

989
01:03:23,713 --> 01:03:25,369
Actually... I...

990
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:30,171
I just need to go to the market.

991
01:03:31,108 --> 01:03:33,129
Why do you need to
go to the market now, mom?

992
01:03:33,515 --> 01:03:35,567
I have to buy that
yellow dress for Laado.

993
01:03:35,629 --> 01:03:37,285
- She wants to wear that.
- I am coming too.

994
01:03:37,369 --> 01:03:38,400
Aneesh, stay close to the phone.

995
01:03:38,515 --> 01:03:41,108
If papa calls tell him
we'll be back in half an hour.

996
01:03:52,213 --> 01:03:54,317
- There are no American passports!

997
01:04:09,379 --> 01:04:11,921
- No American passports?
- No American.

998
01:04:21,994 --> 01:04:24,015
Hey... come here.

999
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:29,504
Quickly... quickly... quickly.

1000
01:04:31,213 --> 01:04:32,942
- No Americans?
- Sir, I don't know sir.

1001
01:04:33,046 --> 01:04:34,504
- Huh?
- I don't know, sir.

1002
01:04:34,577 --> 01:04:37,567
- No Americans?
- I don't know.

1003
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,973
Brother! What are you doing?

1004
01:05:13,265 --> 01:05:16,848
I was checking whether she's
hiding the American passports.

1005
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:22,921
Get all UK passports.

1006
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,077
- Fast!

1007
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:43,817
Ronnie Heston!

1008
01:05:45,348 --> 01:05:47,452
- Ronnie Heston!
- Ronnie Heston!

1009
01:05:48,296 --> 01:05:49,546
Ronnie Heston!

1010
01:05:50,035 --> 01:05:51,983
- Ronnie Heston?
- No!

1011
01:05:54,588 --> 01:05:56,285
Kill all English passengers.

1012
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:57,369
- Ronnie?

1013
01:05:58,202 --> 01:06:00,108
- Ronnie Heston!

1014
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:01,504
Who's Heston Ronnie?

1015
01:06:02,098 --> 01:06:03,338
Ronnie Heston!

1016
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:04,942
Ronnie Heston!

1017
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:08,421
- I am Ronnie Heston!
- Get up!

1018
01:06:09,952 --> 01:06:11,504
- Please...
- Get up!

1019
01:06:14,744 --> 01:06:15,650
Move!

1020
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:19,400
Shoot you!

1021
01:06:19,754 --> 01:06:22,254
Shoot you! Shoot all of you!

1022
01:06:27,994 --> 01:06:29,619
Move!

1023
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:40,879
Shut up!

1024
01:06:41,233 --> 01:06:42,129
Shut up!

1025
01:06:42,202 --> 01:06:43,452
Wonderful!

1026
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:46,713
English, huh!
Wonderful!

1027
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:02,077
- Let's kill him, so that
they send us the pilots sooner.

1028
01:07:03,442 --> 01:07:06,744
We have to keep the passengers alive.

1029
01:07:07,088 --> 01:07:15,077
It's been more than 8 hours.
The negotiator is stalling us.

1030
01:07:15,994 --> 01:07:18,796
Let's kill this Englishman.

1031
01:07:19,254 --> 01:07:20,952
Be patient.

1032
01:07:21,379 --> 01:07:24,150
No time for patience... we must
open the door right now...

1033
01:07:24,265 --> 01:07:26,588
- and kill this Englishman.
- Brother! Stop!

1034
01:07:27,004 --> 01:07:31,598
I say kill the Englishman.

1035
01:07:33,504 --> 01:07:35,275
Look he's back.

1036
01:07:37,848 --> 01:07:39,546
Are you hearing me?

1037
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:43,723
Because we had sealed the airport
it's taking time for the pilots to reach.

1038
01:07:43,796 --> 01:07:45,421
Keep your mouth shut!

1039
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:48,035
Where are the pilots?

1040
01:07:48,765 --> 01:07:50,296
- Pilot!
- How much time?

1041
01:07:51,129 --> 01:07:54,806
There's a radio engineer
present on the plane.

1042
01:07:54,879 --> 01:07:55,858
Radio!

1043
01:07:55,921 --> 01:07:58,140
Now you can communicate with
us through him on the radio.

1044
01:07:58,358 --> 01:08:00,952
- Name?
- His name is Imran Ali!

1045
01:08:01,421 --> 01:08:03,004
- Imran...
- Imran Ali.

1046
01:08:03,088 --> 01:08:03,598
Imran Ali.

1047
01:08:03,681 --> 01:08:05,931
Now you can communicate with
us through him on the radio.

1048
01:08:06,244 --> 01:08:08,785
- Imran Ali!
- Imran Ali!

1049
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:10,796
- Who Imran Ali?
- Imran Ali!

1050
01:08:11,431 --> 01:08:12,640
- Imran Ali!
- Imran Ali!

1051
01:08:12,712 --> 01:08:13,962
Imran Ali!

1052
01:08:14,171 --> 01:08:15,421
Imran Ali!

1053
01:08:17,369 --> 01:08:19,035
- Imran Ali!
- Imran Ali!

1054
01:08:19,212 --> 01:08:20,421
Imran Ali!

1055
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,671
Imran Ali!

1056
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:23,473
You won't tell me?

1057
01:08:23,837 --> 01:08:25,119
I'll shoot him!

1058
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,337
I'll shoot him!

1059
01:08:27,421 --> 01:08:29,150
I...I am Imran Ali.

1060
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,494
Why did you keep quiet earlier!

1061
01:08:35,233 --> 01:08:36,483
Imran!

1062
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:42,983
Sir...

1063
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,546
Sir... he...

1064
01:08:44,723 --> 01:08:46,223
Shut up!

1065
01:08:48,796 --> 01:08:50,212
Sir, please...

1066
01:08:50,317 --> 01:08:51,348
- Shut up!

1067
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:53,796
He can help you.
Please don't hit him!

1068
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,254
How will he help us?

1069
01:08:55,817 --> 01:08:56,504
Help?

1070
01:08:58,806 --> 01:09:01,015
Sir, he was very scared, sir.

1071
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:02,025
Come on.

1072
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:02,754
Come...

1073
01:09:03,212 --> 01:09:04,910
Sir he can help you sir!

1074
01:09:06,483 --> 01:09:07,660
I announced!

1075
01:09:07,869 --> 01:09:09,983
- Announcement!
- Sir, he can help you.

1076
01:09:10,098 --> 01:09:11,525
- Announcement!
- Sir, he can help you!

1077
01:09:11,587 --> 01:09:12,494
No American!

1078
01:09:12,598 --> 01:09:14,150
Announcement... radio engineer!

1079
01:09:14,546 --> 01:09:15,796
You wait...

1080
01:09:16,035 --> 01:09:20,348
- Mansoor... I'm taking him upstairs.
- You keep an eye on the Englishman!

1081
01:09:20,421 --> 01:09:21,431
Sir please...

1082
01:09:24,348 --> 01:09:25,212
Sit! Sit!

1083
01:09:25,285 --> 01:09:26,494
Shut up!

1084
01:09:26,744 --> 01:09:28,442
Sit. Sit.

1085
01:09:28,619 --> 01:09:30,077
I am going.

1086
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,379
Come. Go on.

1087
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:36,410
Khalil, control the passengers!

1088
01:09:40,337 --> 01:09:41,171
Come on.

1089
01:09:42,837 --> 01:09:44,462
Windows... shut them.

1090
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:49,473
Let me talk to them.

1091
01:09:51,317 --> 01:09:52,817
Yes, speak.

1092
01:09:53,442 --> 01:09:55,379
Fast... time!

1093
01:09:55,556 --> 01:09:58,473
The French crew pilots
will be here soon.

1094
01:09:58,858 --> 01:09:59,588
How much longer?

1095
01:09:59,692 --> 01:10:01,879
They're asking how
much longer will it take.

1096
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:05,192
Like I said,
Imran, they will be here soon.

1097
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,952
I have only one request.

1098
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:10,119
Please let the women and children go.

1099
01:10:10,744 --> 01:10:13,900
No women... no children!
Pilot! Pilot!

1100
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:17,598
The pilots are on their way,
please be patient.

1101
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:23,327
Tell him! Pilot! Pilot! Pilot!

1102
01:10:23,431 --> 01:10:25,202
At least give me enough time...

1103
01:10:25,306 --> 01:10:27,004
to get information from Imran.

1104
01:10:27,088 --> 01:10:28,671
Please hurry up.

1105
01:10:28,921 --> 01:10:30,140
Five minutes.

1106
01:10:30,213 --> 01:10:32,119
- Five minutes.
- Okay, brother.

1107
01:10:32,223 --> 01:10:33,754
I'll let you know in a while.

1108
01:10:34,108 --> 01:10:35,213
- Be patient.

1109
01:10:52,973 --> 01:10:54,963
Why you not tell? Imran Ali?

1110
01:10:55,067 --> 01:10:55,713
Huh!

1111
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:56,963
Why?

1112
01:10:57,358 --> 01:10:59,463
Come here. Come.

1113
01:11:04,869 --> 01:11:06,327
Hero, huh!

1114
01:11:09,004 --> 01:11:10,171
Sing.

1115
01:11:10,983 --> 01:11:12,890
Last song... sing.

1116
01:11:12,962 --> 01:11:14,213
Sing for them.

1117
01:11:16,754 --> 01:11:18,140
Sing.

1118
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:20,608
Sing loud!

1119
01:11:26,556 --> 01:11:28,390
Sing the song.

1120
01:11:29,712 --> 01:11:31,306
I don't want to sing.

1121
01:11:31,379 --> 01:11:33,952
- You don't want to sing?
- No, I don't want to sing.

1122
01:11:37,879 --> 01:11:39,306
Sing!

1123
01:11:39,973 --> 01:11:41,358
Please...

1124
01:11:42,473 --> 01:11:43,785
Down!

1125
01:11:44,171 --> 01:11:45,494
Sing!

1126
01:11:46,994 --> 01:11:48,452
Sing!

1127
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:53,098
- Okay, don't sing.
- Okay, okay, I'll sing.

1128
01:11:53,181 --> 01:11:54,181
Sing!

1129
01:11:54,775 --> 01:11:55,681
- Sing!
- I'll sing!

1130
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:56,994
Sing then!

1131
01:11:58,983 --> 01:12:02,723
"When will you come,
Oh the woman of my dreams!"

1132
01:12:03,775 --> 01:12:08,192
"It's a fine day, when will you come?"

1133
01:12:13,025 --> 01:12:16,806
- Louder...
- "Come, Oh dear.."

1134
01:12:17,025 --> 01:12:18,483
Loud, loud...

1135
01:12:18,858 --> 01:12:20,004
"Oh the woman of my dreams!"

1136
01:12:20,108 --> 01:12:21,535
For everyone.

1137
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:23,619
"When will you come.."

1138
01:12:24,421 --> 01:12:28,098
"It's a fine day,
when will you come?"

1139
01:12:28,838 --> 01:12:31,952
"Come, Oh dear.."

1140
01:12:34,608 --> 01:12:37,556
Sing louder, or I'll shoot this one.

1141
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:38,942
I want my mom.

1142
01:12:39,056 --> 01:12:42,463
"When will you come,
Oh the woman of my dreams!"

1143
01:12:43,431 --> 01:12:44,963
"It's a fine day.."

1144
01:12:46,598 --> 01:12:49,192
Go sit. Hero.

1145
01:12:49,973 --> 01:12:51,181
Go!

1146
01:12:58,379 --> 01:13:01,535
Go, go, go.

1147
01:13:21,702 --> 01:13:23,358
'Laado!'

1148
01:13:58,858 --> 01:14:06,504
"Teach me to walk again,
lift me in your arms, mom!"

1149
01:14:07,619 --> 01:14:15,535
"Wipe my face with your shawl,
wherever you spot some dirt."

1150
01:14:24,369 --> 01:14:28,494
"When life stares down at me."

1151
01:14:28,577 --> 01:14:32,910
"I remember your words.."

1152
01:14:32,994 --> 01:14:37,358
"You're the one who scolded me
for my mistakes!"

1153
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:42,150
"Why isn't the whole world like you,
mom?"

1154
01:15:17,338 --> 01:15:26,025
"I want to complain about everybody,
they trouble me, mom."

1155
01:15:26,129 --> 01:15:34,608
"Give me shelter, call me to you,
my heart is with you."

1156
01:15:45,077 --> 01:15:46,285
'Laado!'

1157
01:15:57,765 --> 01:16:00,910
He needs to use the washroom urgently.

1158
01:16:02,525 --> 01:16:06,035
Your plane... country...

1159
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:09,577
Hey! What are you saying?

1160
01:16:13,056 --> 01:16:14,192
- Stand up!

1161
01:16:15,838 --> 01:16:18,577
Hey!
Go back.

1162
01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:21,463
- He needs to use the washroom.
- Go back.

1163
01:16:21,921 --> 01:16:24,421
- He's just a kid, let him go.
- Go back!

1164
01:16:25,046 --> 01:16:27,546
- He needs to go to the bathroom.
- Go back.

1165
01:16:28,796 --> 01:16:30,640
Let them go.

1166
01:16:31,827 --> 01:16:33,379
I'll keep a watch.

1167
01:16:34,015 --> 01:16:35,327
What do you mean let them go?

1168
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,660
- He's just a kid...
- Is he your kid?

1169
01:16:38,077 --> 01:16:41,035
Brother, he's just a small kid.

1170
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:46,067
That's the least we can do.
Please control your anger.

1171
01:16:46,838 --> 01:16:48,150
Control my anger?

1172
01:16:48,369 --> 01:16:50,588
Are you trying to teach me?

1173
01:16:51,046 --> 01:16:51,629
Yes.

1174
01:16:51,702 --> 01:16:54,369
Yes? You are trying to teach me?

1175
01:16:54,452 --> 01:16:57,817
Khalil! What are you doing?

1176
01:17:04,629 --> 01:17:06,369
- What's going on here?

1177
01:17:08,452 --> 01:17:14,504
What's going on here? Why?

1178
01:17:14,681 --> 01:17:16,515
- Why?
- He...

1179
01:17:16,587 --> 01:17:18,879
If we fight with each other
the passengers will overpower us!

1180
01:17:18,952 --> 01:17:19,983
- Where's your head?

1181
01:17:20,098 --> 01:17:21,421
I'm sorry, aunty.

1182
01:17:22,463 --> 01:17:23,494
It's okay. It's okay.

1183
01:17:23,577 --> 01:17:24,546
Stop it!

1184
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:27,952
Shhh. Come, come, come.

1185
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:31,400
Move!

1186
01:17:32,025 --> 01:17:33,233
Go!

1187
01:17:34,765 --> 01:17:36,744
It's okay.

1188
01:17:56,556 --> 01:17:58,056
Open!

1189
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:40,348
Little time?

1190
01:18:40,421 --> 01:18:41,452
Little time!

1191
01:18:41,879 --> 01:18:45,431
- You need more time.
- This is not a Pakistani airline.

1192
01:18:45,494 --> 01:18:47,827
So the pilots are taking
longer to get here.

1193
01:18:48,067 --> 01:18:50,285
Tell him!

1194
01:19:02,004 --> 01:19:06,421
How much longer?
More time? 5 minutes.

1195
01:19:06,702 --> 01:19:07,713
10 minutes.

1196
01:19:08,056 --> 01:19:09,442
20... 30...

1197
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:11,765
You're letting them fool you.

1198
01:19:12,056 --> 01:19:13,640
What are you doing here?

1199
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,317
What are you doing here?

1200
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:18,483
- Go down now.
- Are you hearing me?

1201
01:19:21,785 --> 01:19:23,171
Khalil.

1202
01:19:23,838 --> 01:19:25,390
Khalil!

1203
01:19:28,254 --> 01:19:30,327
The devil is playing with us.

1204
01:19:31,483 --> 01:19:32,796
Go down now.

1205
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:34,087
Now!

1206
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,744
I know what to do.

1207
01:19:49,838 --> 01:19:51,181
Brother.

1208
01:19:52,931 --> 01:19:54,140
Brother?

1209
01:19:58,067 --> 01:19:59,598
Brother?

1210
01:20:04,254 --> 01:20:07,410
- Yes.
- Imran's no more.

1211
01:20:10,233 --> 01:20:12,108
If the pilots don't get here...

1212
01:20:14,306 --> 01:20:16,629
then each and every one...

1213
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,848
- Keep talking to them.

1214
01:20:37,942 --> 01:20:39,671
- Sit. Sit!
- You killed?

1215
01:20:40,338 --> 01:20:43,254
Yeah, I killed him.
You next? You next?

1216
01:20:43,848 --> 01:20:45,056
Sit down!

1217
01:21:02,723 --> 01:21:04,181
Where's the radio engineer?

1218
01:21:04,942 --> 01:21:06,192
Where?

1219
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:09,463
Oh... dead.

1220
01:21:10,119 --> 01:21:11,546
He's dead!

1221
01:21:25,796 --> 01:21:29,025
- I want my mother.
- me too.

1222
01:21:29,098 --> 01:21:32,327
- I want my mother.
- me too.

1223
01:21:34,213 --> 01:21:36,223
We'll all go home soon, okay.

1224
01:21:38,348 --> 01:21:39,629
Eat something.

1225
01:21:40,817 --> 01:21:41,504
Here.

1226
01:21:41,577 --> 01:21:43,004
Mom, I am not hungry.

1227
01:21:43,108 --> 01:21:45,640
I made this specially for you,
you must eat one.

1228
01:21:45,713 --> 01:21:47,765
I've a sore throat, so it hurts.

1229
01:21:47,838 --> 01:21:50,369
What do you feel like eating?

1230
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:52,587
I don't want anything.
Seriously, I don't want anything.

1231
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:53,733
It'll get wasted.

1232
01:21:53,848 --> 01:21:55,577
How about we ask Sharma aunty...

1233
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:57,837
to teach us how to make chowmein.

1234
01:21:58,192 --> 01:21:59,921
If you learn to cook a few things...

1235
01:22:00,306 --> 01:22:02,494
you'll have fewer
problems when you go back.

1236
01:22:03,338 --> 01:22:07,744
I feel if Laado can mould herself...

1237
01:22:08,306 --> 01:22:10,140
then things will be better.

1238
01:22:11,369 --> 01:22:13,515
I don't mean that she isn't trying...

1239
01:22:13,588 --> 01:22:15,213
Who said she is going back?

1240
01:22:15,358 --> 01:22:17,858
Instead of making her understand,
you are encouraging her.

1241
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:23,140
Girls always have to be
the ones to adjust.

1242
01:22:23,629 --> 01:22:25,817
Can we discuss it some other time?

1243
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:27,483
Let's talk about this later.

1244
01:22:28,046 --> 01:22:30,296
Will things get better
by brushing this under the carpet?

1245
01:22:31,838 --> 01:22:33,890
There are differences
in every marriage.

1246
01:22:34,754 --> 01:22:37,640
You can't give up
on your marriage, dear.

1247
01:22:38,546 --> 01:22:41,910
- You don't know everything...
- Then tell me.

1248
01:22:42,265 --> 01:22:43,577
What happened?

1249
01:22:44,108 --> 01:22:46,879
Let's first finish..
Laado! Laado!

1250
01:22:52,483 --> 01:22:53,619
What's that?

1251
01:22:56,588 --> 01:22:59,212
Naresh wrote letters to papa.

1252
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:06,942
"Dear sir, I don't like that...

1253
01:23:07,254 --> 01:23:10,515
you keep calling up
your daughter so often."

1254
01:23:11,004 --> 01:23:15,421
"No respectable father will
ever let his daughter model..."

1255
01:23:17,296 --> 01:23:20,181
"If you call Neerja to Mumbai again..."

1256
01:23:20,671 --> 01:23:23,890
"then don't bother sending her back."

1257
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:28,692
"Even a poor man sends his daughter
with gifts when she gets married."

1258
01:23:29,744 --> 01:23:32,587
"You sent Neerja empty-handed."

1259
01:23:36,931 --> 01:23:43,848
"Harish... your daughter doesn't
know basic chores... even cleaning."

1260
01:23:45,067 --> 01:23:47,463
"She is of no use to me"

1261
01:23:48,515 --> 01:23:52,817
mummy, I swear, I
tried to do everything.

1262
01:23:53,233 --> 01:23:55,556
I swept and mopped the floors...

1263
01:23:55,775 --> 01:23:57,879
washed clothes, cleaned the utensils.

1264
01:24:00,358 --> 01:24:03,390
When I came back home,
the wound on my head...

1265
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,515
wasn't because I slipped and fell.

1266
01:24:14,608 --> 01:24:16,525
I am sorry, papa.

1267
01:24:19,681 --> 01:24:20,233
No, dear.

1268
01:24:20,317 --> 01:24:22,463
I couldn't be your brave girl.

1269
01:24:27,442 --> 01:24:29,171
I ran away.

1270
01:24:34,525 --> 01:24:35,952
No, dear.

1271
01:24:44,046 --> 01:24:45,785
No, dear.

1272
01:24:47,806 --> 01:24:50,754
I don't want to die before
I am actually dead, mom.

1273
01:24:59,619 --> 01:25:01,879
I won't send my Laado anywhere.

1274
01:25:06,327 --> 01:25:07,858
I'll be right back.

1275
01:25:14,744 --> 01:25:15,983
What?

1276
01:25:16,442 --> 01:25:18,692
I'll give everyone something to eat.

1277
01:25:19,817 --> 01:25:22,035
- Aren't you hungry?
- Go!

1278
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:32,463
I need help to
distribute refreshments.

1279
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,025
Let's just give food
to everybody, okay.

1280
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:47,858
Neerja, do something... please...

1281
01:26:28,213 --> 01:26:29,244
Some more.

1282
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:37,671
- Hey... move back!

1283
01:26:38,296 --> 01:26:39,160
Back!

1284
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:40,723
- Give!

1285
01:26:44,348 --> 01:26:45,660
Please read this.

1286
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:48,827
On my signal,
you have to open the emergency exit.

1287
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,213
Get water. Go!

1288
01:27:04,504 --> 01:27:05,640
Move!

1289
01:27:05,963 --> 01:27:07,171
Back!

1290
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:11,244
Back!

1291
01:27:18,056 --> 01:27:19,608
Hello!

1292
01:27:20,452 --> 01:27:21,629
Hello!

1293
01:27:22,192 --> 01:27:24,452
Hello!

1294
01:27:34,463 --> 01:27:35,775
Come on.

1295
01:27:40,473 --> 01:27:41,619
- Sir.
- Yes.

1296
01:27:42,213 --> 01:27:44,160
379 people are trapped on that plane.

1297
01:27:44,265 --> 01:27:46,858
Don't you think this can
be quite humiliating for Pakistan?

1298
01:27:46,973 --> 01:27:49,577
Why should it be
humiliating for Pakistan?

1299
01:27:50,108 --> 01:27:52,015
The terrorists are not from Pakistan.

1300
01:27:53,265 --> 01:27:58,931
The passengers' safety is our
priority. We're doing the best we can.

1301
01:27:59,004 --> 01:27:59,838
- Sir...
- Yeah.

1302
01:27:59,910 --> 01:28:01,463
What are the demands of these people?

1303
01:28:01,535 --> 01:28:02,858
We're trying to talk to them.

1304
01:28:03,067 --> 01:28:04,869
As soon as we come to know,
we'll let you know.

1305
01:28:04,942 --> 01:28:07,379
Sir... if we can't fulfill their demands...

1306
01:28:07,452 --> 01:28:08,942
then what will the
government's stance be?

1307
01:28:09,046 --> 01:28:12,869
Do you think that the Pakistani
government is sitting idle?

1308
01:28:16,973 --> 01:28:21,035
You two will cover this section.

1309
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:22,150
Yes sir!

1310
01:28:52,671 --> 01:28:53,702
Water.

1311
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:56,306
"Neerja..."

1312
01:29:57,035 --> 01:30:00,192
"I have been eagerly
waiting for your birthday."

1313
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:04,785
"I've re-written
this letter 15 times."

1314
01:30:06,348 --> 01:30:08,567
"But I finally found the courage
to give it to you today."

1315
01:30:10,244 --> 01:30:12,494
"Neerja I know that you're afraid."

1316
01:30:13,369 --> 01:30:15,140
"Your fear is completely justified."

1317
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:18,098
"Fear eventually gives us courage."

1318
01:30:18,765 --> 01:30:22,202
"Your past will try to stop
you from moving on in life."

1319
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:32,619
"But even with that fear, move
one step forward for my sake."

1320
01:30:34,473 --> 01:30:35,963
"marry me, mademoiselle."

1321
01:30:38,358 --> 01:30:42,358
"You are the one who believes
that life should be big, not long."

1322
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:45,765
"Let's live a big and grand life."

1323
01:30:46,015 --> 01:30:47,400
"Please say yes."

1324
01:30:47,473 --> 01:30:50,317
"By the way which film is that
dialogue from? Safar right?"

1325
01:30:52,296 --> 01:30:53,921
Anand you idiot.

1326
01:31:53,504 --> 01:31:54,369
Good evening.

1327
01:31:54,483 --> 01:31:55,942
This is All India Radio.

1328
01:31:56,015 --> 01:31:58,640
You're listening to the
news with Vandana Mehta.

1329
01:31:58,723 --> 01:31:59,900
In the headlines.

1330
01:32:00,108 --> 01:32:03,546
Due to the hijacking
of Pan Am flight 73 in Karachi...

1331
01:32:03,619 --> 01:32:06,713
the situation
continues to be tense.

1332
01:32:06,994 --> 01:32:10,504
Even after 15 hours of negotiations...

1333
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:14,640
things are at an impasse.

1334
01:32:15,369 --> 01:32:18,390
It's being said
that these terrorists...

1335
01:32:18,463 --> 01:32:20,515
belong to Palestine's
Abu Nidal Group.

1336
01:32:21,004 --> 01:32:27,244
There are more than 100 Indian
passengers and flight crew on the plane.

1337
01:32:53,223 --> 01:32:56,588
Three men are in airport
security uniforms. - Yes.

1338
01:32:56,692 --> 01:32:58,088
This guy is wearing a pathani suit.

1339
01:32:58,431 --> 01:33:00,723
Look at him carefully.
He is their leader.

1340
01:33:01,108 --> 01:33:02,702
We have 4 entry points.

1341
01:33:03,192 --> 01:33:04,442
These two in the front.

1342
01:33:05,077 --> 01:33:07,254
- The five of you will go in first...
- Yes sir.

1343
01:33:07,431 --> 01:33:08,577
from this entry point.

1344
01:33:08,692 --> 01:33:09,338
Yes, sir!

1345
01:33:26,692 --> 01:33:29,754
Please protect my daughter!

1346
01:33:29,858 --> 01:33:34,473
Please protect my daughter!

1347
01:33:37,463 --> 01:33:40,098
Please protect my daughter!

1348
01:33:48,692 --> 01:33:50,910
Sir. The target has opened
the 2A window shutter.

1349
01:33:50,983 --> 01:33:52,306
What's the order, sir?

1350
01:33:52,379 --> 01:33:54,525
Don't shoot until you
see all four targets.

1351
01:33:59,879 --> 01:34:01,160
Sir, the plane lights are off!

1352
01:34:01,827 --> 01:34:04,192
- The auxiliary power's run out.
- Let's go.

1353
01:34:05,338 --> 01:34:09,931
- Military has cut the power for the plane!
- They are going to enter the plane!

1354
01:34:10,765 --> 01:34:12,567
The military won't enter!

1355
01:34:12,775 --> 01:34:14,369
Only the light has gone off sir!

1356
01:34:14,973 --> 01:34:17,296
- The military won't come inside.
- Sir... the battery is down sir!

1357
01:34:18,025 --> 01:34:19,692
That will put the
passengers in danger.

1358
01:34:19,869 --> 01:34:22,577
The time has come!

1359
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:25,285
Everything will be over now!

1360
01:34:25,358 --> 01:34:28,421
Fahad! Mansoor! Fahad!

1361
01:34:28,494 --> 01:34:29,952
Kill them!

1362
01:34:32,244 --> 01:34:33,306
It's time.

1363
01:34:35,098 --> 01:34:35,848
It's just the emergency lights!

1364
01:34:35,963 --> 01:34:36,900
Shut up!

1365
01:34:38,046 --> 01:34:40,192
Sir the auxiliary power has run out.

1366
01:34:40,275 --> 01:34:41,171
Sit down!

1367
01:34:41,588 --> 01:34:42,494
Shut up!

1368
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:17,879
Come on, come on! Let's go out!

1369
01:35:18,088 --> 01:35:20,556
Come on, get out!

1370
01:35:21,733 --> 01:35:23,160
Come on, slide down!

1371
01:35:24,410 --> 01:35:26,254
Out! Out!

1372
01:35:32,963 --> 01:35:34,452
Sanjana, come quickly.

1373
01:35:34,525 --> 01:35:36,598
Let's go.
Come.

1374
01:35:36,713 --> 01:35:38,035
Come on, move!

1375
01:35:39,598 --> 01:35:42,265
Come on, move quickly!

1376
01:35:42,379 --> 01:35:43,410
Slide down!

1377
01:35:43,494 --> 01:35:45,369
Please open the door, sir.

1378
01:36:05,327 --> 01:36:06,567
I'll help you.

1379
01:36:06,744 --> 01:36:07,723
Come on.

1380
01:36:10,744 --> 01:36:12,233
Let's go!

1381
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:29,619
Out! Come out!
Come out! Sir, come out!

1382
01:36:31,598 --> 01:36:33,088
Mansoor!

1383
01:36:34,171 --> 01:36:37,463
No, Fahad. If you throw
the grenade we'll all die!

1384
01:36:37,890 --> 01:36:39,442
We're already dead, Mansoor!

1385
01:36:45,088 --> 01:36:47,192
We can survive Fahad!

1386
01:36:51,963 --> 01:36:53,588
Let's go son.

1387
01:36:55,577 --> 01:36:58,015
Leave her, come with us.

1388
01:37:02,702 --> 01:37:05,098
We can still escape, Fahad!

1389
01:37:14,765 --> 01:37:19,515
- Neerja, come on.
- You go, I'm just coming.

1390
01:37:20,775 --> 01:37:22,098
Ma'am come!

1391
01:37:33,504 --> 01:37:34,567
Leave us.

1392
01:37:46,504 --> 01:37:49,233
Mama come.
Come, come.

1393
01:37:51,785 --> 01:37:54,108
- Samar, carefully!
- Jump, jump!

1394
01:37:55,254 --> 01:37:56,577
Neerja, get down!

1395
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:01,546
Neerja, let's go!

1396
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:07,973
Sir, come on, sir.

1397
01:38:12,223 --> 01:38:14,327
Mama! I want my mama!

1398
01:38:14,410 --> 01:38:16,348
Neerja aunty, save us!

1399
01:38:16,567 --> 01:38:19,785
We want our mama.
Please save us! Please!

1400
01:38:21,504 --> 01:38:23,785
Help me please!

1401
01:38:27,931 --> 01:38:29,660
Come, come on.

1402
01:38:53,577 --> 01:38:54,973
We have to go down this slide.

1403
01:38:57,233 --> 01:38:58,963
Come on. Come with me.

1404
01:39:15,056 --> 01:39:17,275
Jatin... get down.

1405
01:39:17,390 --> 01:39:18,942
Go down.

1406
01:41:09,692 --> 01:41:12,879
No, no, no... do you have any
idea what we're going through.

1407
01:41:14,275 --> 01:41:17,640
I want to know the status
of purser Neerja Bhanot.

1408
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:22,129
No, I will not hold the line anymore.

1409
01:41:22,338 --> 01:41:24,660
I'm tired of holding the line!

1410
01:41:25,327 --> 01:41:26,879
Hello.

1411
01:41:27,202 --> 01:41:28,796
Hello.

1412
01:41:29,192 --> 01:41:30,358
Hello.

1413
01:41:35,129 --> 01:41:36,338
Why are you crying, son?

1414
01:41:36,421 --> 01:41:38,671
Why are you crying?
Your sister will be fine.

1415
01:41:39,056 --> 01:41:41,598
Be quiet. Come here.
She will be fine.

1416
01:41:42,015 --> 01:41:43,473
Why is he crying?

1417
01:41:44,619 --> 01:41:48,088
This is bad,
you shouldn't cry like this.

1418
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,275
Don't cry. It brings bad luck.

1419
01:41:55,535 --> 01:41:57,025
Mr. Harish...

1420
01:41:57,129 --> 01:41:59,004
but there's a lot of
confusion here.

1421
01:41:59,077 --> 01:42:01,785
It's difficult to get
any information.

1422
01:42:02,171 --> 01:42:04,285
Give me some time...

1423
01:42:04,671 --> 01:42:07,556
I'll call you as soon as
I find out anything.

1424
01:42:07,765 --> 01:42:10,431
Can you hear me? Hello.

1425
01:42:10,515 --> 01:42:13,629
- Yes... thank you.
- Bye.

1426
01:42:44,431 --> 01:42:45,463
Rama.

1427
01:42:49,681 --> 01:42:51,660
Let's go. Come on.

1428
01:43:45,921 --> 01:43:47,754
Shall we go?

1429
01:43:59,306 --> 01:44:01,171
Come, son. Let's go.

1430
01:44:54,848 --> 01:44:57,244
Hello. Welcome home!

1431
01:46:48,504 --> 01:46:51,973
Look...

1432
01:46:52,285 --> 01:46:56,410
on your birthday.

1433
01:46:57,744 --> 01:46:59,796
Mama remembers, darling.

1434
01:47:34,098 --> 01:47:39,858
Neerja's mom.
She sent a message for you.

1435
01:47:40,744 --> 01:47:44,702
- What?
- 'Pushpa, I hate tears.'

1436
01:48:14,244 --> 01:48:17,754
Neerja is no more.

1437
01:48:19,421 --> 01:48:21,567
It's been over a year...

1438
01:48:21,921 --> 01:48:23,379
It's hard to believe.

1439
01:48:24,181 --> 01:48:33,254
So cheerful... so full of life...

1440
01:48:34,546 --> 01:48:37,046
so... happy-go-lucky.

1441
01:48:37,327 --> 01:48:38,327
And she...

1442
01:48:40,452 --> 01:48:42,921
passed away on her 23rd birthday.

1443
01:48:44,869 --> 01:48:46,629
At first, it really hurt that...

1444
01:48:47,994 --> 01:48:50,494
she sacrificed her
life for her passengers.

1445
01:48:51,535 --> 01:48:54,244
She didn't even think
about her mama once?

1446
01:48:57,035 --> 01:48:58,723
Everyone asks me...

1447
01:48:59,671 --> 01:49:02,067
what kind of upbringing
did you give your daughter...

1448
01:49:02,171 --> 01:49:06,473
that she grew up to
be as brave as a soldier...

1449
01:49:06,869 --> 01:49:08,327
that the guns didn't scare her.

1450
01:49:10,171 --> 01:49:12,421
I didn't even know that...

1451
01:49:13,056 --> 01:49:17,775
my daughter was so brave...

1452
01:49:18,994 --> 01:49:20,900
and such a good hearted child.

1453
01:49:21,535 --> 01:49:24,869
In fact,
I would keep nagging her.

1454
01:49:26,890 --> 01:49:28,765
"Don't work so hard."

1455
01:49:28,838 --> 01:49:30,744
"Lower your eyes while walking."

1456
01:49:30,952 --> 01:49:32,577
"mind your own business."

1457
01:49:33,348 --> 01:49:38,067
"Think about your own honor
and life, when in danger."

1458
01:49:39,431 --> 01:49:43,213
Isn't that what we
teach our daughters?

1459
01:49:44,858 --> 01:49:49,056
We consider our brothers
to be the brave ones.

1460
01:49:50,421 --> 01:49:53,119
Sisters expect their
brothers to protect them.

1461
01:49:53,827 --> 01:49:57,369
No one ever asks
a sister for protection.

1462
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:01,681
That's how I raised
Neerja as well.

1463
01:50:01,744 --> 01:50:03,369
That's how I raised
Neerja as well.

1464
01:50:03,452 --> 01:50:05,556
You could share a laugh with her...

1465
01:50:05,671 --> 01:50:07,785
make her recite any
of Rajesh Khanna's dialogues.

1466
01:50:08,806 --> 01:50:10,910
But I wonder how this child...

1467
01:50:12,421 --> 01:50:15,410
turned out to be
so completely different.

1468
01:50:17,181 --> 01:50:18,838
Her horoscope said...

1469
01:50:19,546 --> 01:50:21,306
that she was destined
to be a shining light.

1470
01:50:22,879 --> 01:50:29,160
But when you lose your
23 year old daughter like this...

1471
01:50:31,223 --> 01:50:34,588
that pain is impossible
to describe.

1472
01:50:36,785 --> 01:50:43,202
There can be no bigger pain
in the world than losing one's child.

1473
01:50:44,119 --> 01:50:47,588
At times, I felt like dying too.

1474
01:50:54,994 --> 01:51:00,410
People tell me that Neerja isn't
dead, she has become immortal.

1475
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:04,660
I console myself...

1476
01:51:05,806 --> 01:51:08,233
that my Laado's become immortal.

1477
01:51:09,421 --> 01:51:13,275
But what about the haunting thought...

1478
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:19,421
that I'll never
see my daughter again.

1479
01:51:25,369 --> 01:51:29,473
The night she was leaving
for her last flight...

1480
01:51:29,963 --> 01:51:31,515
I kept nagging her repeatedly.

1481
01:51:31,598 --> 01:51:35,140
"Do this... don't forget this... do that..."
And she left.

1482
01:51:38,754 --> 01:51:43,504
I wish I had taken
her in my arms just once...

1483
01:51:43,796 --> 01:51:45,869
and hugged her tight.

1484
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:49,181
Just once.

1485
01:52:13,473 --> 01:52:19,379
When Neerja received the highest
honor for bravery, the Ashok Chakra...

1486
01:52:20,879 --> 01:52:24,910
President Gyani
Zail Singh consoled me.

1487
01:52:25,994 --> 01:52:28,244
He said...

1488
01:52:28,838 --> 01:52:31,900
that there is no other
mother in the country like you.

1489
01:52:31,963 --> 01:52:34,671
You should hold your
head high with pride.

1490
01:52:34,921 --> 01:52:37,098
You should be proud.

1491
01:52:38,088 --> 01:52:42,150
"By sacrificing her life while
trying to save the passengers..."

1492
01:52:42,358 --> 01:52:48,994
"ms. Neerja, displayed exceptional
bravery under unusual circumstances."

1493
01:52:51,296 --> 01:52:55,421
Harish and I must have
good karma...

1494
01:52:57,379 --> 01:52:59,973
that Neerja was our daughter.

1495
01:53:01,056 --> 01:53:03,379
Even as she was breathing her last...

1496
01:53:05,025 --> 01:53:07,129
she taught me how to live.

1497
01:53:07,525 --> 01:53:11,650
There was a small child on the plane,
she told him...

1498
01:53:12,775 --> 01:53:14,879
"Tell my mama..."

1499
01:53:15,588 --> 01:53:17,317
Neerja's mom.

1500
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:21,838
She sent a message for you.

1501
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:23,817
That...

1502
01:53:26,504 --> 01:53:28,369
"Pushpa..."

1503
01:53:29,702 --> 01:53:32,160
"I hate tears!"

1504
01:55:15,983 --> 01:55:25,848
"This fleeting moment coaxes you
to think beyond yourself.."

1505
01:55:26,171 --> 01:55:31,202
"Go on living.. go on living.."

1506
01:55:31,588 --> 01:55:36,702
"Forget the sorrow of strangers.."

1507
01:55:36,775 --> 01:55:41,285
"Let the sun shine through your window."

1508
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:46,358
"Go on living.. go on living.."

1509
01:56:08,119 --> 01:56:12,317
"Beneath the feet is cold.."

1510
01:56:12,431 --> 01:56:17,775
"the earth which beckons us to sprint."

1511
01:56:18,515 --> 01:56:28,306
"A lively fragrance in the chest of time,
it leaves everything behind."

1512
01:56:29,390 --> 01:56:34,556
"Let the sands of the past slip
through your fingers."

1513
01:56:34,671 --> 01:56:39,431
"Allow yourself to be
in the here and the now."

1514
01:56:39,546 --> 01:56:48,265
"This fleeting moment coaxes you
to think beyond yourself.."

1515
01:56:49,129 --> 01:56:54,796
"Go on living.. go on living.."

1516
01:56:55,108 --> 01:57:00,223
"A slice of laughter for taste.."

1517
01:57:00,296 --> 01:57:04,775
"A twig of life for keeps.."

1518
01:57:04,879 --> 01:57:09,952
"Go on living.. go on living.."

1519
01:57:21,213 --> 01:57:26,213
"Overcome the hiccups and hesitations.."

1520
01:57:26,285 --> 01:57:31,452
"This is the plea of time."

1521
01:57:31,535 --> 01:57:34,244
"Why die when you can live?"

1522
01:57:34,317 --> 01:57:41,963
"Drink the drops,
it's the rain of your dreams.."

1523
01:57:42,348 --> 01:57:47,452
"Let the streams pave the paths."

1524
01:57:47,556 --> 01:57:52,150
"Let yourself go beyond the light."

1525
01:57:52,358 --> 01:58:01,879
"This fleeting moment coaxes you
to think beyond yourself.."

1526
01:58:02,223 --> 01:58:07,577
"Go on living.. go on living.."

1527
01:58:28,952 --> 01:58:38,233
"This fleeting moment coaxes you
to think beyond yourself.."

1528
01:58:38,827 --> 01:58:46,848
"Go on living.. go on living.."

1529
01:59:31,202 --> 01:59:35,546
"We'll look fear in the eyes."

1530
01:59:36,806 --> 01:59:42,775
"We'll pass through the path of danger."

1531
01:59:42,879 --> 01:59:48,369
"We've set out with passion.."

1532
01:59:48,796 --> 01:59:54,483
"We'll look fear in the eyes."

1533
01:59:54,598 --> 02:00:00,223
"We'll look fear in the eyes."

1534
02:00:11,452 --> 02:00:14,296
"When it rains from people's eyes.."

1535
02:00:14,369 --> 02:00:17,463
"it marks the arrival of a new season."

1536
02:00:17,535 --> 02:00:22,994
"my dreams taught me to live."

1537
02:00:23,546 --> 02:00:28,827
"The night of life has passed.."

1538
02:00:29,108 --> 02:00:35,296
"Bright and shiny is the morning!"

1539
02:00:35,608 --> 02:00:40,546
"To hell with you, fear.."

1540
02:00:41,410 --> 02:00:44,254
"Your time's up, fear.."

1541
02:00:44,338 --> 02:00:47,213
"Let's get straight buddy,
fear is nobody."

1542
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:55,140
"Open your eyes, no shut.
Tell fear to get lost!"

1543
02:00:55,838 --> 02:00:58,681
"Tell fear to get lost!"

1544
02:00:58,931 --> 02:01:04,567
"We'll look fear in the eyes."

1545
02:01:04,629 --> 02:01:10,296
"We'll pass through the path of danger."

1546
02:01:10,369 --> 02:01:16,410
"We've set out with passion.."

1547
02:01:16,515 --> 02:01:20,827
"We'll look fear in the eyes."

1548
02:01:20,931 --> 02:01:28,056
"We'll look fear in the eyes."

1549
02:01:28,129 --> 02:01:33,848
"We'll look fear in the eyes."
