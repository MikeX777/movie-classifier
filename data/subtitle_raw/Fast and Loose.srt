1
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,203
Hello?

2
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,744
What do you mean,
they're still busy?

3
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,788
Oh, they can't be busy all night.

4
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,914
Now... now listen, operator,
be a sport, try again, will you?

5
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,758
This is my girl,
I wanna talk to her.

6
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,251
Sure.

7
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,754
That's fine.
Call me back as soon as you get her.

8
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,471
Okay.

9
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,184
Oh, no, no, please,
the next dance!

10
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,803
Oh, the happy bride-to-be!

11
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,056
- Oh, shut up.
- Tell me, sis.

12
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,059
How's lord Fauntleroy, the big stiff?

13
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,819
How can you bear to be separated
even for a moment

14
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,313
from that beanpole?

15
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,941
Now, let me alone,
can't you see I'm not fooling?

16
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:04,037
I... oh, I don't know
what's the matter with me.

17
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,032
Oh, gee, sis, I'm sorry.

18
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,159
Here, I'll fix you a drink,
it'll cheer you up.

19
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,831
- Uh-uh.
- No?

20
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,544
All right, here's how.

21
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,334
A short life and a merry one.

22
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:16,800
From where I'm sitting,
it looks like a long and dreary one.

23
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,543
Listen, sis.

24
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,672
That's because you're not in love.

25
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,595
Maybe you're right.

26
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:27,436
I don't suppose I ever will be.

27
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,727
Got to get married sometime.

28
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:37,276
I used to think that maybe
the right man would come along someday.

29
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:42,493
Well, t'll keep on waiting and looking.

30
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,784
Even after you're married to that fellow?

31
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,281
Well, why not?

32
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,749
He's only marrying me
for the money anyway.

33
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:53,917
And I'm only marrying him because...
Well, because...

34
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:57,712
Mother and uncle George
want a title in the family.

35
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,129
Ha!

36
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,219
Well, here's to uncle George.

37
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,431
May he slip on a banana peel
and break his neck.

38
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:09,645
Uncle George could never slip
on anything as unrefined as that.

39
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,229
Oh, there's Alice.

40
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,851
Hello, darling.

41
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,569
You're darned tootin'
I still want long beach.

42
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,157
I've been wanting 'em for hours.

43
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,321
Well, I know they're there.

44
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,490
Yes, ring 'em again,
will you, operator?

45
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,329
Call me back.

46
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,824
What service.

47
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:34,294
27, 28, 29... phew!

48
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,500
Well, hot or cold,
all men are alike.

49
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,253
Oh, Millie, I think you're
being mean and rotten.

50
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,427
It isn't bertie's fault
he takes a drink now and then.

51
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,174
All his crowd does.

52
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,426
He was brought up that way.

53
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,974
He has more money
than is good for him

54
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,894
and he's never had anyone to answer to.

55
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,563
Why, you can't expect him
to change in a minute.

56
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,688
He's a grade a number one souse.

57
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,031
Would you pardon me, dearie?
I've got ten of these to do.

58
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,776
If Bertie ever took a drink of water,
it'd poison him.

59
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,494
I won't have you talking
about him that way, Millie.

60
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,285
He's going to pull himself up,
and when he does,

61
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,999
- I'll marry him.
- Whoopie!

62
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,710
And a load of horsefeathers... oh!

63
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,582
Listen. When that bird marries you,
I'll take the veil.

64
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,376
You know, it's all right
for a chorus girl to be a sap.

65
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,675
In our business,
you don't need brains, only legs.

66
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,673
But there are times, Alice,
when you're that dumb

67
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,891
I could give you
a good sock in the nose.

68
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,886
- Millie.
- Now, listen, baby brain.

69
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,979
When a guy like Bertie lenox
trails a girl like you,

70
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,018
he's strictly on the make, see?

71
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,234
- Millie, I don't want you to talk like that.
- All right, all right.

72
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,521
But the only orange blossoms you'll ever
see will come out of a cocktail shaker.

73
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,818
Millie, I can't stand it,
it isn't fair.

74
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,410
Why don't you let me alone?

75
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,997
Oh, Alice, I'm sorry,
but you know...

76
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,126
Hello?

77
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,666
Oh, just a minute.

78
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,790
Here you are, baby,
it's your boyfriend.

79
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,760
Hello? Hello, Bertie?

80
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,254
No. It's nothing.

81
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,221
Millie's been teasing me again.

82
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,887
Well, cheer up.

83
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,636
Yeah, I'm coming over
and I'll bring a couple of bottles.

84
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,353
We can toast to Marion over there.

85
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:18,099
Sure, we'll make whoopee.

86
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,270
'Course I'm not tight!

87
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:24,271
No! I've only had a few drinks
to congratulate my sister.

88
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:29,151
You can't let your sister get engaged
without congratulating her, can you?

89
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,654
"Course not!

90
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,282
Well, Marion, Alice wants
to congratulate you.

91
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,035
Just a minute, Alice, she's right here.

92
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,582
Hello, Alice.

93
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,205
I'm so happy for you.

94
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,380
Isn't it wonderful?

95
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:51,178
Tell me, are you...
Terribly, terribly in love?

96
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:56,053
Why, of course I am!

97
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:02,276
Well, it wouldn't be getting married if I
weren't just terribly in love, would I?

98
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,986
Oh, thank you. Goodbye.

99
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:10,575
Am I terribly, terribly in love?

100
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,321
Oh yes.

101
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,953
You won't forget that little bit
about the lion and the eagle, will you?

102
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,250
Jolly good if I do say so myself.

103
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,671
No, we won't forget that
for a long time, lord rockingham.

104
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,543
- Thank you, thank you.
- Good night.

105
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,466
- Good night.
- Thank you very much.

106
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,887
Yes indeed.

107
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,731
Carrie, are you sure that rockingham
is the right man for Marion?

108
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,148
Why, Bronson!

109
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,067
Arthur is a member
of one of the oldest...

110
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,985
And most conservative
families of Europe.

111
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,609
Yes, and just think how old Europe is!

112
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,532
I'm surprised at your attitude, Bronson.

113
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,030
A girl as unmanageable as Marion
might easily have married

114
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,624
some perfectly impossible person.

115
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:03,587
It's a thing that's been known to happen
even to the best people.

116
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,706
I know all that.

117
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,920
But I'm still not sure
that I want that man

118
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,135
to be the father of my grandchildren.

119
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,379
Bronson, don't be difficult.

120
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,038
Oh, there you are, old thing!

121
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,753
Oh dear. How the deuce am I to know
to whom I'm engaged

122
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,248
if you pass this around
among your friends?

123
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,213
You know, it would be devilish annoying
if I have to kiss the wrong girl.

124
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,712
Depends on her taste, rocky.

125
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,511
- It probably would be annoying.
- Her taste?

126
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,602
Oh yes... lipstick, of course,
oh, ha-ha-ha!

127
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,268
You know, you know,
I didn't quite get you at first.

128
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,436
You haven't quite got me yet.

129
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,686
Never mind that.
It won't be long until the wedding.

130
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,689
Rocky...

131
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:17,366
Are you terribly, terribly much
in love with me?

132
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,784
Why, what a strange question.

133
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,409
Yes. That seems to be the general opinion.

134
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,916
I'm going.

135
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,334
- I don't follow.
- Good.

136
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,799
- Look here, what's the matter?
- Rocky, please don't touch me.

137
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:32,963
Let me go, will you?

138
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,463
- Let me go, rocky.
- Blast it all, you can't treat me like this!

139
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,261
Who says she can't,
you big stiff?

140
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,181
Bertie, please don't start anything.

141
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,055
I'm all mixed up.

142
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,102
Come on, I wanna go get some air.

143
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,725
Sure, kid.

144
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,022
But...

145
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,875
Wonderful party, rockingham.

146
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,210
I say, Grafton.

147
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:11,502
What would you do
if someone called you "a large stiff"?

148
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,919
A what?

149
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,293
A large stiff.

150
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,923
Why, I... I'd refuse to meet him socially.

151
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,346
Well, I can't refuse to meet
my future brother-in-law.

152
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:27,097
You mean, Bertie called you a...
A large stiff?

153
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:31,522
Yes. I suppose his associations
are responsible for his manner.

154
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,061
His associations?

155
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,654
Well, of course,
it's none of my business,

156
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,943
but as I'm practically a
member of the family,

157
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,067
I think that you should know the worst.

158
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,493
Bertie is going to marry a chorus girl.

159
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,207
A chorus girl?

160
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:52,548
Oh, this is dreadful, I... but...
Are you absolutely sure?

161
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,415
Who is she? Do you know her?

162
00:09:54,469 --> 00:10:00,214
Well, it so happens that I know her
roommate... that is, very slightly.

163
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,511
It can't... it can't be true.

164
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,180
Well, there's not a
shadow of a doubt in it.

165
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:08,271
They're constantly seen lunching,
teaing, dining, and dancing together.

166
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,560
Every club in town is buzzing with it.

167
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,899
Where is Bertie?

168
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,861
He just left here with Marion.

169
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,448
Marion has left her own engagement party?

170
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,114
Oh...

171
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,737
This is dreadful.

172
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:27,115
It will kill her mother,
we mustn't tell her.

173
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,210
This is dreadful, we...
We must do something.

174
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,955
Yes, but what?

175
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,376
We must think.

176
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,090
An excellent suggestion.

177
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,270
Rockingham, are you thinking?

178
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,435
- I think so.
- Good.

179
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:02,700
Come in, sis, Alice'll be glad to see you.

180
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,786
No, bertie.

181
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,496
I want to be alone.

182
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,661
I don't know what's the matter with me.

183
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,287
Do you know,
I've never felt like this before.

184
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,256
Oh, sure, I understand.

185
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,963
You drive on home, sis,
and I'll taxi it back.

186
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,221
Oh... oh, you'd better take this,
it's turning cool.

187
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,886
Thanks.

188
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,180
- Good night.
- Good night.

189
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,217
I wouldn't leave my car
on that loose sand too long, ma'am.

190
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,809
You're apt to get stuck.

191
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,849
I can take care of my own car, thank you.

192
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,815
Yes, ma'am. You sure can.

193
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,672
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:08,386
I can see from the way you handle that stick
that an automobile has no secrets for you.

195
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,597
Sure gives me pleasure
to see you so expert.

196
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:15,344
It's a wonderful thing, the way gals are
improving their learning these days.

197
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:20,190
Used to be when a gal got stuck,
she'd ask the nearest man to help her.

198
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,775
Oh, you haven't got
a cigarette about you, have you?

199
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,111
There's a package on the seat of the car.

200
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,480
Thank you. Thank you.

201
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,204
Sure do like to smoke after a swim.

202
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,834
Can't think of anything nicer
than having just one.

203
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:50,712
And sitting here smoking
and watching a pretty girl repairing a car.

204
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,054
Oh, shut up.

205
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:57,678
I've never heard such a Gabby, useless,
stupid, boorish, big idiot in all my life!

206
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,849
Why don't you get up and help me,
you big boob?

207
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,849
Who, me?
You want I should help you?

208
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,317
I thought you told me
to mind my own business.

209
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,313
I don't mind helping you
if you're sure it won't spoil your fun.

210
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,690
I'll give you ten dollars
if you get this car out of here.

211
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,781
No, ma'am.

212
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,822
- Twenty.
- No, ma'am.

213
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,162
How much do you want,
you big grafter?

214
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,578
All you got to do
is say you're sorry you was rude to me.

215
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,085
I'm sorry.

216
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,593
And furthermore, you got to say
you don't know nothing about cars at all.

217
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,554
- Just for your own good.
- It won't do it.

218
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,298
Then set there.

219
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:50,029
I don't know anything about cars.

220
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,238
At all.

221
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,525
At all.

222
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,404
Now we can commence.

223
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:00,407
- Can you get it out of here?
- I can try.

224
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,841
Now, you put this little
board under the wheel.

225
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,930
But how can I?
It's stuck in the sand.

226
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,470
It ain't gonna be there long.

227
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,899
Now, when the wheel comes up,
you stick the board under.

228
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,489
- You flatter yourself.
- Be that as it may,

229
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,735
when that wheel comes up,
you stick the board under.

230
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,156
Yes, sir.

231
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,621
There.

232
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,923
You know why men was made
stronger than women?

233
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,217
- Why?
- 'Cause they never was intended

234
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:00,092
for to be their equal,
don't forget that.

235
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,343
Women was intended to be ornaments,

236
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,721
to charm their men
in their lighter moments

237
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,144
and soothe them when they're tired.

238
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,482
I don't like you.

239
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,568
Yes, ma'am?

240
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,981
You make me sick.

241
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,729
Yes, ma'am?

242
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,823
I never want to see you again.

243
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,282
Yes, ma'am.

244
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,873
You come swimming here every night?

245
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,666
Mostly.

246
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:33,007
Well, then I'll avoid this place hereafter.

247
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,750
It's okay with me.

248
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,311
Will you be swimming here tomorrow night?

249
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,851
Sure will.

250
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,270
I wouldn't miss my swim for anything.

251
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,395
- Oh, before I forget.
- Yes, ma'am?

252
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,068
I think you're a big mug.

253
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,289
When I think of how poor Arthur
must be suffering,

254
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,456
oh, I can't bear it,
I can't bear it, I can't bear it!

255
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,204
Now, now, Carrie,
Marion can take care of herself.

256
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,080
There's nothing to be upset about.

257
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,045
How can you say such a thing?

258
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,795
To leave her own party
and rush off into the night like a...

259
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,046
Hyena.

260
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,799
- Keep your feathers on, George.
- Don't be a fool.

261
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:28,055
- I have no feathers.
- It's unforgivable, simply unforgivable.

262
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:32,058
And of course, nobody believed
that story about her sudden illness.

263
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:36,654
Hello, everybody. Party over?

264
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,022
I suppose I'm in the wrong.

265
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,572
Marion. What were you thinking?
After all your father and I

266
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,410
- have done for you?
- I'm sorry I left,

267
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:47,498
but I couldn't stand it any longer,
I had to get away.

268
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,742
Well, I... I can't just explain it,

269
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:53,372
but everything seemed to be
crowding in around me,

270
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,543
I had to get out,
I just thought I'd choke.

271
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,083
You understand.

272
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,390
Don't you, dad?

273
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,181
Of course I do.

274
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,305
Now, you run upstairs
like a good little girl

275
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:14,229
and get a good night's sleep, huh?

276
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,772
Thank you, father.

277
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,114
- Good night.
- Good night.

278
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,114
What is the matter with her?

279
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,708
Oh, there's nothing the
matter with her, George.

280
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,000
It's just that she's tired
of this sort of thing, that's all.

281
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,292
I know how she feels.

282
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,507
I'd like to get away myself sometimes.

283
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,342
Bronson!

284
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:44,760
Well, I... I'm sorry, Carrie.

285
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,132
Good night.

286
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,938
I don't know what the boy's been up to,

287
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:57,731
but I know that he would never think
of marrying that kind of woman.

288
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,196
After all, George,
he's my son, Carrie's son.

289
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,156
Oh, just a minute, bertie.

290
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,406
What is it?

291
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,871
Something little boys shouldn't hear?

292
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,330
Sit down.

293
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,167
We've been talking about you.

294
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:24,136
Your uncle tells me that there's a rumor
that you're engaged to a chorus girl.

295
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,257
Well, it's more than a rumor, dad... I am.

296
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:30,351
I'm sure you don't mean
that literally, son.

297
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,345
You needn't be afraid to tell me.

298
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,189
It's just a little adventure, eh?

299
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,480
No, sir, it isn't just a little adventure.

300
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,149
I suppose you're not paying her bills.

301
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,863
She's not that kind.

302
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,482
None of them are.

303
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,700
I'll take your word for it, son,

304
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:50,788
but you know what it will mean to
your mother if this affair goes on.

305
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,999
Well, mother's got to stand for it
sooner or later.

306
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,494
You intend to marry this girl?

307
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,836
I do.

308
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,504
Do you realize what you're doing, bertie?

309
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,467
Perfectly, sir.

310
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,929
I appreciate that you've
always been honest with me.

311
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,799
I've always trusted you,
I always want to.

312
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,553
But I can't pretend
that this isn't pretty much of a blow.

313
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,397
Well, I realize that, dad,
but if you knew Alice...

314
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,561
I'd rather not talk about it.

315
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:23,188
All t ask is that you don't get married
without first letting me know.

316
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,985
Very well, sir.

317
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,653
Thank you, son.

318
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,618
- Good night.
- Good night, dad.

319
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,907
Good night, uncle George.

320
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,836
Well? Do you believe me now?

321
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,830
What are you going to do?

322
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,706
- I don't know.
- But I do.

323
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,344
You've got to get hold of this girl,
pay her, and get her out of the way.

324
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:49,259
- Yes, but how?
- Rockingham is going to arrange it.

325
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,133
- Rockingham?
- Yes. He knows the girl she lives with.

326
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,887
He's going to invite them to have dinner
with us at Luigi's tomorrow night.

327
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,640
- What?
- It's perfectly all right.

328
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:03,236
We are supposed to be...
Theatrical agents.

329
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,527
Friends of his.

330
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,276
It's not a very pleasant idea.

331
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,072
But I'd like to take a look at the girl.

332
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,741
Yes, and this way,
she'll be off her guard.

333
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,330
You can see just what
sort of creature she is.

334
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,995
I'll think it over.

335
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,085
Good heavens, man, don't you realize
there's no time to lose?

336
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:24,879
If this thing gets into the papers,
it will kill Carrie.

337
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,168
- Perhaps you're right.
- Bronson.

338
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,545
Isn't Marion home yet?

339
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,047
Why, what's the matter?

340
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,594
What are you two talking about?

341
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,808
Just a little matter of business, Carrie.

342
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,224
What is it? What's happened now?

343
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,846
Oh, you two are conspiring.

344
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,223
I can't bear it,
I can't bear it,

345
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,647
- I can't bear it!
- Now, now, now, Carrie, do be reasonable.

346
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,066
Something has happened.

347
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,610
I insist upon knowing the truth,
I insist upon it.

348
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,949
Very well.
If you must know, Carrie,

349
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:55,447
George and I are planning to have supper
with a couple of chorus girls.

350
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,665
Bronson, why can't you ever be serious?

351
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,661
You and George with a
couple of chorus girls.

352
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:07,171
That's the only funny thing
I've heard for days.

353
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,756
Yes, it is funny, isn't it?

354
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,418
Good evening.

355
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,166
Oh, heavens, is that you?

356
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,588
Sure, it's me.

357
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,427
I thought you hung out
further up the beach.

358
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:38,424
I didn't know this was the spot
you, uh, infested.

359
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,720
Yes, ma'am.

360
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,060
You've made a bad mistake,
so if you like,

361
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:45,522
although I don't have to,
I'll drag myself up yonder.

362
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,858
Oh, now that you're here,
you might as well stay.

363
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,194
Yeah, I figured you'd
come to that conclusion.

364
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,405
You know, I think you're
the most objectionable man

365
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,320
I've ever met in all my life.

366
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,443
You didn't come down here
to tell me that, did you?

367
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,035
Yes, I did.

368
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,121
Yeah, I figured you would.

369
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,788
No woman could say enough mean things
to a man in just one night.

370
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,706
She'd be bound to think
of something she forgot

371
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,080
after she got home
and come down the next night

372
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,047
and baw! Him out some more.

373
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,916
You know quite a lot
about women, don't you?

374
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,589
Yes, ma'am.

375
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,929
I've looked 'em over
hither and yon quite thoroughly.

376
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,845
But never have I seen one
so completely and thoroughly

377
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:26,723
and confoundedly sweet
as you all appear to be.

378
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:29,476
- Who, me?
- Yes, ma'am.

379
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,480
Are you trying to tell me
in that funny english you speak

380
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,777
that you like me?

381
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:42,496
- Those are my sentiments.
- Well, I hate you.

382
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,990
Fine. Now I can go for another swim.

383
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:48,836
Oh, if you had a bathing suit with you,
you could come with me.

384
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,206
- But you probably can't swim anyway.
- I can swim!

385
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,082
Like you drive a car, maybe?

386
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,797
I can swim better than you can.

387
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,010
Oh, all right.

388
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:59,130
Bring down your bathing suit sometime
and show me.

389
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:04,226
- I'm from Missouri.
- I, um... I brought my bathing suit.

390
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,060
In that?

391
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,398
Well, I ain't stopping you.

392
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,438
The ocean belongs to everybody.

393
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:15,483
Um, would you like me to go in with you?

394
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,402
You can come if you want to.

395
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:21,652
But, uh, would you like me to?

396
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,199
I suppose so.

397
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,792
Do you think I could change
here on the beach?

398
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:32,254
Well, I ain't a peeker,
if that's what you're worrying about.

399
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:36,125
Well... I'll change back of the car.

400
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,262
I suppose when the world was young,

401
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:26,100
Adam and Eve stood just like this
in the garden of Eden.

402
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:28,435
What do you suppose they thought about?

403
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:33,353
I reckon about the same sort of things
we're thinking.

404
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,228
- What were you thinking about?
- About you.

405
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:40,151
That's funny,
I was thinking about you.

406
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:45,278
Were your thoughts respectable?

407
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,950
No.

408
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,289
Neither were mine.

409
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,204
Maybe we'd better go in swimming.

410
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,667
Maybe we had.

411
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,298
- Aggh!
- Oh, come on!

412
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,013
By the way, what's your name?

413
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,356
Henry.

414
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,816
- Mine's Marion.
- Pleased to meet you.

415
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:23,190
You don't swim bad for a girl.

416
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,319
You're not so rotten yourself.

417
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,413
I like to be by your side.

418
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,247
Do you like to have me by your side?

419
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,960
Yeah, it sort of pleases me.

420
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:38,421
I think I'd like to be by your side always.

421
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,791
I got some water in my ear,
I didn't hear what you said.

422
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,257
I said, uh... I think I'm getting tired.

423
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,802
Oh. Roll over and rest your head on my arm.

424
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,674
Oh, gee, I'm happy.

425
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:53,554
I think I'm happier than I've
ever been before in all my life.

426
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,897
- I am too.
- Oh...

427
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,188
Aggh!

428
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,735
You'll get us drowned!

429
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,152
We'd better turn back.

430
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,151
I don't want to turn back.

431
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,205
You turn back or I'll spank you!

432
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,949
Oh yeah?

433
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,667
Honey, I ain't afraid of no woman.

434
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,207
Now, you turn back or I'll SWAT you.

435
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,499
Try.

436
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,747
Oh yeah?

437
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,961
Ohl

438
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,259
now, you keep on going
and I'll give you some more.

439
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:36,730
Oh... oh, I'll just put my coat around me
and dry off when I get home.

440
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,951
Good night.

441
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,968
Some night.

442
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,246
Good heavens, sis.

443
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,370
Don't tell me you're tight.

444
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:45,920
No, bud, but I guess it
feels just the same.

445
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,509
- What's the matter with you?
- Shh!

446
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,629
I'm in love.

447
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,050
Who with?

448
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,390
Henry.

449
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,258
Henry?

450
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,057
There are millions of Henrys,
Henry who?

451
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,805
I don't know.

452
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,932
Just Henry.

453
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,355
Come on. Sleep it off.

454
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,942
I'll go in the back way.

455
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:11,066
I don't want to talk to anybody.

456
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,285
Such a wonderful dream.

457
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,244
I don't ever want to wake up.

458
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,958
How do you take your tea, rocky?

459
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,708
With just a dash of soda and no ice.

460
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,176
Your tea, foolish!

461
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,013
I'm sorry. I mean,
just a little cream and no sugar.

462
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,398
Is anything wrong with me, rocky?

463
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,618
Um, have I aged since you saw me last?

464
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,988
No, but Marion, after all,
you are engaged to me, and...

465
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,162
Yes, you know, I seem to remember
we were engaged.

466
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,206
Only this morning, I noticed a ring
on my dressing table,

467
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:08,628
and I said to myself,
"now, who gave me that?"

468
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:11,464
Then your face sort of came back to me.

469
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,632
Well, upon my soul!

470
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,676
Here, old thing.

471
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,675
Look here, Marion,
you're not giving me the Chuck?

472
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,301
Sorry, but I am.

473
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,632
Rocky, you wouldn't want a wife
who didn't really love you,

474
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,892
well, I... I suppose not,
but you know, it's an awful shock.

475
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,859
Well, it's your own fault.

476
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:32,027
You must be a weak character
or I wouldn't have lost interest in you.

477
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,991
Weak? I, weak?

478
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:37,987
A strong man would have held me
and made me a better woman.

479
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,284
But I'm no animal trainer.

480
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,408
No, darling. You're a whole circus.

481
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,962
You know, you are a comic.

482
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,207
You break my heart,
but you do make me laugh.

483
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,459
You act as if your heart's broken.

484
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:56,931
Rocky, you know, we would have lasted
about a week.

485
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,675
Yes, well, perhaps you're right.

486
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,722
I know I am.

487
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,642
But it was nice being engaged to you.

488
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,765
Why, thanks no end.

489
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,813
- Goodbye.
- Cheerio, and, uh,

490
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,188
let me know when you find
your animal trainer, will you?

491
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,781
Yes, I will!

492
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,150
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

493
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:20,575
Now listen, Alice, I won't have you running
around with every Tom, dick, and Harry.

494
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,288
If you don't think any
more of me than that,

495
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,032
I take back what I said last night.

496
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,375
Goodbye.

497
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,087
Where's rockingham?

498
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,672
Heavens, bertie,
what's he done to you?

499
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,886
- You've got murder in your eye.
- He's done plenty.

500
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,676
Oh, well what, honey?

501
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,220
He's invited Alice to go to supper
with him and some friends tonight,

502
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,139
and she broke an engagement with me to go.

503
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,637
- Oh, you're joking.
- I am not.

504
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,765
She insists that she
owes it to Millie to go.

505
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,732
These birds are theatrical agents,

506
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,648
and Millie's persuaded her
that it might mean a better job for them.

507
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,773
But rocky, the funniest
thing I've ever heard!

508
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,985
I don't see why you
should think it's funny.

509
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,112
The man is engaged to you.

510
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,705
But I'm not engaged to
him any longer, darling.

511
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,746
- What?
- No. I just broke the fatal news.

512
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,336
- But, sis, you...
- Darling, I'll tell you all about it later.

513
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,173
Now, I've simply got to duck
before mother finds out.

514
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,541
Well, I'm glad it's off,

515
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,959
first, because he's a total idiot,

516
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,337
and second, because I'm gonna
sock him in the jaw.

517
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,009
Now, please be sensible, bertie.

518
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,678
After all, you can trust Alice.

519
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,722
I'll be sensible, all right.

520
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,778
Why, Carrie!

521
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:42,198
Shh!

522
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,411
I'm so happy!

523
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,030
Marion and Arthur must have made it up!

524
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:48,329
There's a lovely sound
coming from the two little lovebirds!

525
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,416
Shh-shh-shh-shh!

526
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,412
"Lovebirds"?

527
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,679
Why, bertie.

528
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,720
Where did Marion and Arthur go?

529
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,185
In opposite directions,
that's all I know.

530
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,894
Pray what do you mean, bertie?

531
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:13,062
I... well, I think sis would rather
that I did tell you.

532
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,060
Bertie! What do you mean?

533
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,278
Now, don't get excited, Carrie, she...

534
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,863
She's broken her engagement.

535
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,573
She's what?

536
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,363
She's broken her engagement.

537
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,701
George!

538
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:26,412
- Bronson!
- Yes. Go get the smelling salts, bertie.

539
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:29,874
Oh, I can't bear it!
I can't bear it, I can't bear it!

540
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,539
Poor Carrie!

541
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,003
Now, don't make matters worse, George,
it's not a tragedy.

542
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,497
Oh, what will his family think?

543
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,793
Oh, it's too dreadful!

544
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,507
Let Bronson go speak to Marion.

545
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,092
He'll force her to do the right thing.

546
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,632
I'm certainly not going
to force my daughter

547
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,050
to marry a man she doesn't love.

548
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,548
- Bronson!
- I'm sorry, mother,

549
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,015
but you had to hear it sometime.

550
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,101
She didn't have to hear it.
It didn't have to happen.

551
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:51,722
It wouldn't have happened if Marion
hadn't been a silly, spoiled little fool.

552
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,894
Now, see here, George,
don't you think that you ought to hear.

553
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:56,234
Marion's side of the story first?

554
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,023
I must talk to Arthur.
Where is the poor boy?

555
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,022
I'll see him tonight, dear,
and have a chat with him.

556
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:05,027
Oh, I can't bear it,
I can't bear it, I can't bear it!

557
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,403
Oh, I'm sorry, Carrie!

558
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,827
How much longer is it going to take you?

559
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,257
Hey, you under there, how much longer
is it going to take you?

560
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,258
Not long.

561
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,048
Oh, was it badly hurt?

562
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:24,136
No.

563
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,257
Women hadn't ought to be
allowed to drive cars.

564
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,133
It was a man's fault.

565
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,433
- Yeah, that's what women always say.
- Well, it was I tell you.

566
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,396
Well, have it your own way, lady.

567
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,141
Have it your own way.

568
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,311
I'll be a son of sea cook.

569
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,689
Henry!

570
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:47,445
Henry, Henry, come out from under there,
I want to talk you to you. Henry!

571
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,320
Henry, listen to me.

572
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,119
- Henry.
- You'll get that pretty dress of yours all dirty

573
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,243
under here, Ms. lenox.

574
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:57,246
- How long have you been working here?
- Two days.

575
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,372
Oh.

576
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:01,375
That's why you didn't know who I was then.

577
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,378
I heard a lot about the
wild lenox youngster

578
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,381
but I hadn't figured she was
my little friend down at the beach.

579
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:11,055
Well, what difference does it make
if I am Ms. lenox?

580
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,646
Henry, I don't mind
if you were a chauffer, darling.

581
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,392
I'm not a chauffer, I'm a mechanic
where I can build a car.

582
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,270
I just bet you could, dear.

583
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,442
What the?

584
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:27,363
That is if there was no
women around to help.

585
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,201
Oh, Henry, now please don't act like that.

586
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,491
I don't think it's fair, Henry,
come around here and talk to me.

587
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,457
I've got so much to say to you.

588
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,550
Stop hammering.

589
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:47,637
I'm helping, Henry.

590
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,097
Say, haven't you got some place to go?

591
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,308
When the car is finished.

592
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,348
Well, it's all finished now, Ms. lenox.

593
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,437
Good, then we can talk.

594
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,682
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

595
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,730
Oh, Henry.

596
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:05,151
Henry, I wouldn't try to help you
if you didn't want me to.

597
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:06,614
Say, listen, now that I think of it

598
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,700
what right you got to be talking like that?

599
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,445
Ain't you engaged to one of them Dukes
or something?

600
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,289
Well, not anymore, Henry.
I've broken it off.

601
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,204
- You don't think after last night...
- It's no use.

602
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:21,125
This sort of changes things,
I guess we just kind of forgot.

603
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,215
The beach and the water and
the moon shining down,

604
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:27,382
that's what it was, moon shine.

605
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,504
You ain't got no cause to be crying, honey.

606
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:32,804
It's all right, it was just
the moon shine, I tell ya.

607
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,803
Shinning down and make you think
I was one of them diplomats

608
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:41,650
or millionaires or educated like a lawyer
or doctor or dentist maybe.

609
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:45,271
But I ain't, I'm just a plain,
ordinary, everyday man

610
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,156
and I ain't aiming to marry
no millionaire's daughter.

611
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,365
Why shouldn't you want to marry me?

612
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:52,361
It's not my fault if my father's rich.

613
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:56,365
Anyway, I'm fed up with lawyers
and doctors and diplomats.

614
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:59,368
Millionaires make me sick.

615
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:02,871
Henry, I don't care if you're a mechanic.

616
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,794
Whatever you are is good enough for me.

617
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,417
You don't know what you're talking about.

618
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,885
You couldn't marry me, it wouldn't be fit.

619
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,551
You mean you don't want me to.

620
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,766
I mean I can't have you, that's all.

621
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:22,478
Henry, oh, we can't talk very well here.

622
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,271
Will you meet me down at the beach tonight?

623
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,769
No, ma'am, not tonight or no other time.

624
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,317
- I am quitting the job.
- Oh, no, Henry,

625
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,280
no good talking, I'm quitting.

626
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:33,322
Oh.

627
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,593
May I use your telephone, please?

628
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,553
Yes, ma'am, right there.

629
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,729
Roslyn 7421 please.

630
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:47,601
Yes, thank you.

631
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,978
Where are you going, Henry,
don't you like it here?

632
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,479
Yeah, I like it here all right.

633
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:54,779
But I gotta go for personal reasons.

634
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,492
There's a woman in it, I'll bet.

635
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:57,906
Yeah, so.

636
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:00,621
Now wait a minute and I'll get your keys.

637
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,958
Just a minute.

638
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,452
Yes?

639
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,294
Hello, is Henry there?

640
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:11,132
Yes, he's right here, ma'am, just a minute.

641
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,501
Must be her.

642
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,017
Hello?

643
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,932
Yeah, this is me.

644
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,602
Henry, you did a very bad job on my car.

645
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,315
I'm stuck.

646
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,684
I didn't do no such thing.

647
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,312
I fixed the car perfect.

648
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,564
Well, it was all right when you left here.

649
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,860
It ain't my fault.

650
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,859
Well, I'd wish you'd come and fix it.

651
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,485
No, I won't come down and fix it.

652
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,455
I told you before, I quit.

653
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,666
All right, if you want to take money
under false pretenses.

654
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,413
I'm not taking money under false pretenses.

655
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,506
I've never done no sloppy work.

656
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:58,547
Oh, all right, all right, I'll come down
and see whose fault it was.

657
00:41:58,558 --> 00:41:59,843
Where are you?

658
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:03,594
Well, I...

659
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,687
I'm at that abandoned water tower
on the merrick road,

660
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,023
you know, about five
miles below massapequa.

661
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,813
You'll come, won't you? Hurry.

662
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,688
Okay.

663
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,530
I suppose I gotta drive you down there.

664
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,525
Never mind, I'll go down in my Lizzie.

665
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,867
Got your repair kit?

666
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:23,534
Yeah, but I won't need 'em,
nothing the matter with that car.

667
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,706
It was sweet of you to come, Henry.

668
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,753
I'll say it was.

669
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,807
There was nothing the matter with this car.

670
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,771
Just a little grease on the distributor.

671
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:38,613
- All fixed.
- Oh, yeah?

672
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,777
Very clever of you, Henry.

673
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,447
It was stupid of me not
to find out the trouble.

674
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,912
You couldn't expect no woman
to understand about mechanics.

675
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,998
No, I don't suppose you could.

676
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,616
Want me to start it for you?

677
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,665
If you please.

678
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:56,164
You always wanna pull this here
spark down before you start,

679
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,631
it makes it easier.

680
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,752
- Oh, thank you, Henry.
- No trouble at all.

681
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,768
Funny how quick an engine will cool off
when you let it stand a little while.

682
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,481
Yes.

683
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:18,194
I didn't figure I'd have to use the choke
on a warm afternoon like this.

684
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,155
You always want to be careful not to leave
this here choke on too long

685
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:24,822
or the raw gas will wash the oil off
the cylinder walls and score 'em up.

686
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,945
Oh, thank you, Henry.

687
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,916
There ain't nothing the
matter with this car.

688
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,915
I can see that.

689
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,462
It's bound to start.

690
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,632
Oh, yes, Henry.

691
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:56,023
Ain't run out of gas, have ya?

692
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,939
Why, the indicator says
three quarters full.

693
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,777
How 'bout water?

694
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,567
Oh, I just put a whole lot in.

695
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,736
I'll have a look just the same.

696
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:07,827
Oh, is that where you put the water, Henry?

697
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,741
Where did you put it?

698
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:13,833
Why, um, right there where you always do.

699
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,578
Oh, right there, eh, where you always do?

700
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:19,877
- Yes.
- If you was a man I'd sock you right on the nose.

701
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,091
Oh, ah, Henry, don't sock me, dear.

702
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,886
Did I do wrong?

703
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,929
Oh, no, you didn't do wrong,
you just do things different, that's all.

704
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:33,019
You didn't happen to put ten gallons
of gasoline in the radiator did you?

705
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,933
Where is the radiator, Henry?

706
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:36,977
Aw, shut up.

707
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,771
I gotta go get a car and
tow you outta here.

708
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,895
But, Henry, you're not gonna leave me
just sitting here, are you?

709
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,238
It'll be dark in a couple of minutes.

710
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:54,290
"Where is the radiator?"

711
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:17,517
It was awfully good of you to let me
drive back with you, Henry.

712
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:20,312
I don't know how I'm going
to get along without you.

713
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,731
You get along all right.

714
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:27,072
I know, dear, but I'll miss you so.

715
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:29,909
You don't think it's gonna
be so easy for me, do you?

716
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,823
I hope not.

717
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,243
I hope you just fade away.

718
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,959
What's the use of talking like that?

719
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:42,296
You know it ain't fit that we should
splice up and what ain't fit I don't do.

720
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,881
Well, why isn't it fit?

721
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,715
Well, think of the
hullabaloo it would make.

722
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,928
Oh, what of it,
I've been in the papers all my life.

723
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,762
Well, I ain't.

724
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,223
And I don't aim for us to
be nobody's comic strip.

725
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,970
Give people a laugh with
their morning coffee.

726
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:01,145
You wouldn't care about that
if you really loved me.

727
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:04,360
I wouldn't really love you
if I didn't care about it.

728
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,319
Well, I can't beg you, Henry.

729
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,864
I don't want you to, honey.

730
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:15,739
I'd rather be your husband
than governor of Missouri.

731
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,117
Well, I should think so.

732
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,134
Cheer up, baby, you look
like a thunder cloud.

733
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:33,051
These theatrical guys will cast you for
an offstage noise if you're not careful.

734
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:35,345
I shouldn't have come, Millie.
Bertie was so mad when I told him,

735
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,139
there's no telling what he might do.

736
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,102
Look, which is the better pal to you?

737
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,562
Me or bertie?

738
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,062
Lord rockingham's party, please.

739
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,903
Yes, madam, right this way.

740
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:50,023
I wish you'd stay for supper
after all your trouble.

741
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:53,276
No, no, no, knowing better if I were
to leave them here with you for a while.

742
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:58,327
You see, if I were here they'd be too,
uh, well, too impressed to be natural.

743
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:01,952
Yes. Yes, that will do, waiter.

744
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,247
Enter.

745
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,960
Why, girls, I am so pleased to see you.

746
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:10,960
Hello, rocky, the grand Duke in person,
Alice, not a picture.

747
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,758
Say, Ms. o'Neil, you know,
I've heard a lot about you, Ms. o'Neil.

748
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,051
Thank you, lord rockingham.

749
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,924
She's gotten a load of you too, baby.

750
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:20,975
Now, girls, I want you
to meet my friend, Mr. Williams.

751
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,061
Ms. o'Neil and Ms. Montgomery.

752
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:23,931
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

753
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:26,025
And Mr. Vincent.

754
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,814
Pardon me, I didn't get the name.

755
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:31,314
Vincent, Lionel Vincent.

756
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,735
Lionel?

757
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,906
I bet you're the king of beasts,
you great big wild thing.

758
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,450
Well, I have sad news for you girls.

759
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,038
I'm afraid I must be popping.

760
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:43,284
- We'll see you later.
- Righty-ho, have a jolly time.

761
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,126
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

762
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,122
Sit, sit, won't you sit down, Ms. o'Neil?

763
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:48,669
Thank you.

764
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,798
And m... yes.

765
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,091
Lionel.

766
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,806
How that man gets
from place to place I don't know.

767
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:02,019
I was always taught human muscles couldn't
work without getting messages from a brain.

768
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:05,310
I see you are not without perspicacity.

769
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,899
- What nice girl is?
- Oh.

770
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,907
After all them hot dogs you put away.

771
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,071
But that was hours ago.

772
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,286
You know just as well as
I do it ain't fitting.

773
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,747
Stop talking so much, I'm hungry.

774
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:28,500
- Come on, Henry.
- But listen, this is a swell dump.

775
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,793
I can't take you in here.

776
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,008
Oh, please.

777
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,293
I tell you it ain't...

778
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,012
Oh, please, Henry.

779
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:39,803
Oh, all right.

780
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,301
I don't see why I'm so weak.

781
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:50,651
Say, is rockingham's party here yet?

782
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,939
Steady, young man.

783
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:56,065
I want to know if rockingham's
party is here yet.

784
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,316
Bertiel

785
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,402
hello, sis!

786
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:06,333
What's the idea,
you want to be in on the massacre?

787
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,168
No, you come with us, dear.

788
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,458
I have something terribly
important to tell you.

789
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,082
No, I'm gonna stay right here.

790
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,503
You heard her, brother.

791
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:20,093
- Do you want a sock in the eye too?
- Oh, please.

792
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,137
Bertie, this is Henry.

793
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,136
Henry?

794
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:29,390
Oh, say, listen, you're the very fella
I've been wanting to see.

795
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:33,986
Listen, listen, Henry, we've got to find
a last name for you, Henry.

796
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,527
How are you gonna get married
without a last name?

797
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:40,493
Don't you worry about that, brother.

798
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:42,407
May we have a private dining room, please?

799
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,279
- Yes, miss.
- Thank you.

800
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,502
You know, Mr. Williams, you don't look
to me like theatrical men.

801
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,541
No? What do we look like?

802
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:54,086
More like the cloak and suit trade.

803
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:55,173
What?

804
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,088
Well, there's no harm in being a drummer.

805
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,427
It's good, safe work.

806
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,012
Unless some husband
catches you at it, Harry.

807
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,972
My name is not Harry.

808
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:06,185
No, I know, but somehow
I can't help thinking of you as Harry,

809
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,144
talking about drummers I guess.

810
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,230
Remember, I told you about Harry.

811
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:13,476
He was a menace to women too,
you cute little devil.

812
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,148
He traveled in bvd.

813
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,361
Nonsense.

814
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,947
There's a law against that sort of thing.

815
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,237
I just love this man, he's so pure.

816
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:24,362
Sit down, sit down.

817
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:27,115
I've never seen you on the stage, Ms.
O'Neil,

818
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,866
what did you appear in last?

819
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,163
Nothing worth mentioning, Mr. Williams.

820
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,036
She had it all over me.

821
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,130
I was supposed to appear
in a couple of beads

822
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:39,298
but they were wax beads
and I'll never forget that July.

823
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:42,422
Each Pearl a tear, eh?

824
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,219
Say...

825
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,184
Oh, no, Harry needs me more than you do.

826
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:50,145
I feel a great sorrow
has come into his life.

827
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:52,140
It has.

828
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,233
Oh, Alice, don't you just adore mean men?

829
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:58,070
Oh, Harry is really an angel, Ms.
Montgomery.

830
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,314
He is? What shows has he bagged?

831
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:01,657
Oh, Harry!

832
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,322
Millie, stop clowning.

833
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,663
I'm sure it's not hard to tell
you're here for business reasons.

834
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,702
If you want a job, ask for it.

835
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,372
Here, bertie, you drink this, darling.

836
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,961
There.

837
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,421
- Henry?
- No thanks.

838
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:20,088
Oh, go on, have some coffee, mister...

839
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,006
Mister?

840
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:24,050
What'd you say your name was?

841
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:27,016
Morgan, I told you before
my name's Henry Morgan.

842
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:31,103
Oh, yes, yes, Morgan, Morgan.

843
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,688
Are you related to a bank?

844
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,900
No, to a garage, my old man owns it.

845
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:40,692
He'll give me half interest any time
I go back home to birdville.

846
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:45,033
Oh, I know I'm just gonna love
living in birdville.

847
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,698
No, thank you.

848
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,492
- Oh, you don't drink?
- No.

849
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,365
You can't blame her, Mr. Williams.

850
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:54,335
Put her boyfriend in a dog show and he'd
take the blue ribbon for rum-hound.

851
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,999
Millie!

852
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,212
That's enough.

853
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:58,626
Oh, I'm not blaming bertie, kid.

854
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:01,171
I'll bet it's his family's
fault he's a souse.

855
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,132
He says he got an uncle
who ought to be cremated.

856
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,215
Oh, my Harry, oh god.

857
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:11,310
- Oh, oh!
- Stop it, stop it I say!

858
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,396
Stop it! Stop it!

859
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,480
Oh, you all right, baby?

860
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:18,396
Is this young man very attached to you,
Ms. o'Neil?

861
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:22,272
Attached?
Just like Harry and me.

862
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,488
Why don't you two dance?

863
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:28,452
No, no, I don't care to
dance, I don't feel well.

864
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,195
Maybe it's your liver, Harry.

865
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,493
If you dance the way I think you do,
it will do it a world of good.

866
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,287
No, no, go away, go away.

867
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:37,127
Oh, I get it, you little cut up.

868
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,372
You'd rather sit it out
with me while they dance.

869
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:42,250
Oh good heavens, I'd love to dance.

870
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:45,378
I've never felt more like
dancing in all my life.

871
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,425
I simply must dance.

872
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:50,721
That's my big, vital Harry, come on!

873
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:58,440
I am very glad that they've left us alone,
Ms. o'Neil.

874
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:00,355
I have a confession to make.

875
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,320
You really didn't look like
theatrical men to me, Mr. Williams.

876
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,154
Thank you.

877
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:10,279
As a matter of fact,
I'm a friend of the lenox family.

878
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,779
Oh.

879
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,280
I see.

880
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,248
That explains this.

881
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,742
Yes.

882
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,120
They are very worried.

883
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:22,669
I'd be worried too, if my son drank
the way bertie does.

884
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:30,430
Yes, they didn't realize
about that drinking.

885
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:31,719
That's unfortunate.

886
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:36,346
Now take my advice, mister, mister Morgan.

887
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:40,690
If my little sister wants to marry you,
you grab her quick

888
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:44,232
before some other big stiff.

889
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,400
I'm going.

890
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,525
Now don't you think you can forget rocky
for just a minute, bertie?

891
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:52,653
I only meant I was going home.

892
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:55,497
You better let us take you then.

893
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:58,368
You get him to the car, honey,
I'll wait and pay the check.

894
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,335
Don't hold me so tight.

895
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:14,516
Harry, don't you dare pull any more
of that innocent stuff on me.

896
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,432
You know what it is to knock around.

897
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:23,392
Oh, this is terrible, we must go.

898
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,566
- We must go at once.
- Well, Harry, what's the matter? Come back here!

899
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:29,614
Bronson, Bronson...

900
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:31,825
Harry, don't you love me anymore?

901
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:34,411
I haven't any time now, just a minute.

902
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,621
Bronson, this is no place for us.

903
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:37,831
We must leave at once.

904
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,496
Why, Harry?

905
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:41,334
He's gone!

906
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,670
Oh, look!

907
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:52,797
Bertie.

908
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,427
Since when did you turn
into a theatrical agent?

909
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,929
I'm sorry, Mr. Williams.

910
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:02,977
Mr. Williams, eh?

911
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,691
Of course you wouldn't use your own name.

912
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,526
What do you mean talking like that?

913
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,897
- That's my business.
- Bertie, control yourself, you don't understand.

914
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:13,275
Oh, I understand all right
and if you weren't my father I'd...

915
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:16,700
- Your father?
- Yes, and my slinky uncle,

916
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,368
it makes a pretty picture, doesn't it?

917
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,331
I didn't know it was your father, bertie.

918
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:23,372
- No, I suppose not.
- Bertie, listen to me.

919
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,918
I'm here only to save you
and this young woman from a mistake

920
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,756
that you'll regret all
the rest of your lives.

921
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,625
Oh, so that's it, is it?

922
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:34,467
Well, you know that promise I made you?
Well, it's off.

923
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:38,683
Why... why, father.

924
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:40,643
Oh.

925
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,888
So this is where you spend your evenings.

926
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,437
Marion, what are you doing here?

927
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:51,440
Well, as long as this seems to be a
family affair, I might as well tell you.

928
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,816
I, uh...

929
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:59,572
Well, I've been getting
myself engaged to Henry.

930
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,539
Who is this young man, Marion?

931
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,329
I don't quite place him.

932
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:07,455
I'm Henry Morgan, sir, the mechanic
you hired a few days ago.

933
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:10,299
This is more than I can stand.

934
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:13,544
Harry, wait for baby!

935
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:17,594
Oh, come on, sis, there's no use
trying to make them understand.

936
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:20,843
Alice, will you marry me tonight?

937
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,846
No, bertie, I won't.

938
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,687
So he's gotten around you too, has he?

939
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,861
You must be pretty proud of yourself.

940
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:35,983
The only decent thing I've ever wanted
in my life you've taken away from me.

941
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,655
Well, now I'm through with you.

942
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,824
I'm through with both of you.

943
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,787
And now I'm going to the devil

944
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,875
and the sooner I get there,
the gladder I'll be.

945
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:48,462
- Son!
- Bertie, wait a minute!

946
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:52,708
Say, if I ever talked to my old man
that way, he'd whale the tar out of me.

947
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,506
My children would be better
off if I'd done that.

948
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:58,677
Well, nothing you could do would make me
change my mind about Henry.

949
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:01,346
But Marion, this is impossible.

950
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:04,595
I know it's a shock, dad, but...

951
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,348
I can't help loving him.

952
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,065
No, I suppose not.

953
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,940
How about you, Morgan?

954
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:15,655
How can you be sure that
she knows her own mind?

955
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:18,742
She's already been engaged
to a half a dozen other fellas.

956
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,452
Now listen, dad, that was different.
I know my own mind now.

957
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,038
- Be still, Marion.
- I won't be still, you can't make me be still.

958
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,500
- I'm going to marry Henry...
- You heard your father, be still.

959
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:30,996
All right, honey, if you want me to.

960
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,590
But how can we get married
if this thing isn't settled?

961
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:36,801
We're not gonna be
married, we're gonna wait.

962
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:39,467
You're a very wise young man.

963
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,681
Why can't you be sensible, Marion?

964
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,846
Have I ever done anything sensible?

965
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:47,472
Of course, I know it isn't sensible to
marry a mechanic and live in birdville.

966
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:50,724
But it's my one chance to be
somebody real and useful.

967
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:53,569
I'm sick of everything
here, I'm bored to death.

968
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:56,359
- Wish I'd never been born.
- Is that any way to talk?

969
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,607
Well, will you marry me
then, Henry, right away?

970
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,610
I told you before, we're gonna wait.

971
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,612
All right.

972
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:07,411
You win, but you'll be sorry.

973
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:09,000
I don't care what becomes of me now.

974
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:12,622
I'll go to the devil with bertie, I will.

975
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,668
You'll see.

976
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,634
You'll see!

977
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,922
One for you, one for you, one for you,

978
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:25,676
one for myself.

979
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:30,021
Go ahead, have a drink,
I got a new customer.

980
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:31,686
- Is that gratitude?
- Wait a minute,

981
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:34,400
wait a minute now, ladies and gentlemen.

982
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:39,524
Just a minute, there's nothing
now to worry about or get excited over.

983
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:40,990
We're not gonna arrest anybody here,

984
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,610
only those that are drunk and disorderly.

985
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:46,455
All right, boys, check up on them.

986
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:52,669
- Let him go, officer.
- Go on, get out of here.

987
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,664
I've had enough of you, come on, get up.

988
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,563
This disgrace will kill Carrie.

989
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:25,027
All right, once you get down the hall,
search all the rooms.

990
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,488
Ohl

991
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,582
stop climbing over me!

992
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:33,327
Why, Harry, fancy meeting you here.

993
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,748
Oh, Harry, you tickle!

994
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:37,668
Get off of my glasses,
I can't see a thing without them!

995
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:40,918
Oh, Harry's here, alone at last!

996
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:45,430
- Not a minute too soon.
- What do you mean?

997
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,718
You tell that to the judge.

998
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,842
- But you can't arrest me.
- I can't, eh?

999
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:51,561
This is the most immoral act
I have ever seen in my life.

1000
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:54,557
Immoral act, how dare you!

1001
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:57,526
- Get out.
- I refuse to leave this room.

1002
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:59,611
I scarcely know this lady.

1003
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:00,899
What's so funny, sister?

1004
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:04,900
Oh, I have to tell you.

1005
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,027
Now, officer, you're making a mistake.

1006
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:09,654
You'll regret this!

1007
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:13,079
You'll regret this, officer, I tell you.

1008
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:19,581
Will you give me that back,
that don't belong to you, that's my stuff.

1009
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:22,926
Hey, keep your hands off that.

1010
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,090
- What is it?
- The place is being raided, the police!

1011
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:31,593
- Yes, but where's Marion?
- With bertie, I just saw them being arrested.

1012
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:32,970
They're taking them to the police station.

1013
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:34,596
- To the police station?
- Yes!

1014
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:37,725
Well, I'll get them out of it all right. Here,
Morgan, you take care of this young lady.

1015
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:38,976
Yes.

1016
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:41,732
They've taken bertie.

1017
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,071
And Marion.

1018
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,860
Let's go!

1019
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:47,029
I insist on your calling me a taxi!

1020
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,528
This is your taxi!

1021
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,747
Why, what's the matter, Harry,
this is a great chance to see life!

1022
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:55,117
- This is the last straw!
- Get in there.

1023
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,289
- Let's go.
- All right, go ahead.

1024
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,138
Say, think of the headline!

1025
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,599
And what will uncle George say!

1026
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:15,437
Don't mind what George'll say, get inside.

1027
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,648
All right, Mac, let her go.

1028
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:26,027
This is all your fault, young man,
you're guilty of all this.

1029
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:28,696
I'm guilty of your immoral conduct?

1030
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:31,160
Oh, please, uncle George.

1031
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,582
Come on, you, the judge wants to see you.

1032
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,166
Oh, how nice of him,
I thought I made an impression.

1033
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,751
Not you, her.

1034
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,087
- Oh.
- Come on.

1035
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:51,007
You too.

1036
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,507
Back up, you.

1037
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:56,558
Well, how about me, officer,
didn't the judge say something about me?

1038
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:59,852
If he did, the officer's too much
of a gentlemen to repeat it.

1039
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,145
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be in here.

1040
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:05,190
It's just like you said it was,
judge, honest it is.

1041
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,984
We're almost as much to blame.

1042
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:11,702
We should've known they were
too excited to take things right.

1043
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:15,118
Well, judge summer, I hope you're getting
enough bail out of dad to buy a new jail.

1044
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,036
Yes, you certainly do need one.

1045
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:20,535
You might be a little more respectful
to judge summers,

1046
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:23,835
after he was kind enough
to get out of bed to come here.

1047
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:26,003
Furthermore, no matter how much bail
I'm willing to pay

1048
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,626
it won't do you any good.

1049
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,717
Well, what do you mean?

1050
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:31,675
It might sober you up a little bit
to know that all the offenders

1051
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:33,674
are to be held here overnight.

1052
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:37,894
Uncle George, bertie,
think of uncle George.

1053
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:41,060
Uncle George overnight.

1054
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:46,771
Whatever you do, judge,
don't keep him in the same cell with me

1055
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:49,693
- 'cause I want to get some sleep.
- Young man.

1056
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:52,238
Don't you realize what this means?

1057
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,657
The papers are bound to
get hold of this story.

1058
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:58,077
Oh, I must have some new photographs
taken for them.

1059
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,120
Don't bother to have many taken, sis.

1060
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,710
In time, we'll be such an
old story to the papers

1061
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,705
they'll stop featuring us.

1062
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:06,923
Lucky you're not married
to me, bertie lenox.

1063
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:08,791
- If you talk like that I...
- If we were married

1064
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:11,590
there wouldn't be any reason
for my talking like that, that's just it.

1065
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:13,714
That ain't no excuse at all.

1066
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:16,216
Suppose you apologize for
talking so smart like.

1067
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,558
I won't.

1068
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,723
You heard me, kid.

1069
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:30,150
I'm sorry, judge summers,
and dad.

1070
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:33,150
Bertie, suppose you apologize too.

1071
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:37,905
I'm ashamed of you.

1072
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:41,659
Well, that goes for me too.

1073
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:45,833
That will do, Jensen, take them back.

1074
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,126
Come on, sis.

1075
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:56,760
I've already told you that I don't want you
to treat my children

1076
01:04:56,768 --> 01:05:00,727
any differently from the others,
judge summers, and I don't.

1077
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,018
I want you to treat them exactly
as you'd treat any other two children.

1078
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,981
Why, what are you getting at, Mr. lenox?

1079
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,270
This.

1080
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,860
If you knew that tomorrow
they were going to be married

1081
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:13,948
to two fine young people

1082
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:16,944
who would either turn them into useful,
happy human beings

1083
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:20,868
or... or whale the tar out of them,

1084
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,036
what would you say?

1085
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:26,878
Well, I'd say, Mr. lenox,
that I think it would do them far more good

1086
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,291
than a night in jail.

1087
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,085
I was sure you would.

1088
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:32,053
Now suppose I go and have
a little talk with them

1089
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:34,336
and tell them that everything is all right.

1090
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,883
Thank you.

1091
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:45,890
Henry, I've been very foolish
and small-minded about this whole business

1092
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,141
and I hope you two will forgive me.

1093
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:49,814
Of course, Mr. lenox.

1094
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:52,312
Sure I'll forgive you, Mr. lenox,

1095
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,860
but I can't marry your daughter.

1096
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:57,359
You can't marry my daughter?

1097
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,986
And who are you, young man?

1098
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:02,990
Great heavens, Carrie,
what are you doing here?

1099
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:04,161
Why shouldn't I be here?

1100
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:07,161
Everyone else in my family is,
unless Arthur was mistaken.

1101
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:09,003
Rockingham, that idiot.

1102
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:11,999
Who is this, Bronson?
I insist upon knowing.

1103
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,672
This is Henry Morgan, Carrie.

1104
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:17,007
The young mechanic I told you I'd hired.

1105
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:20,098
A mechanic and Marion?

1106
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:22,934
Oh, this is too much I can't bear it,
I can't bear it!

1107
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,929
You don't have to, lady,
I just said I wasn't gonna marry her.

1108
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,272
Why, why, how dare you!

1109
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:33,942
And this is Ms. o'Neil, no doubt Arthur
was kind enough to explain about her.

1110
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,064
Bertie's chorus girl.

1111
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:39,112
- I want to tell you something.
- I advise you to be careful.

1112
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,283
She's a much better behaved young woman
than your own daughter

1113
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:46,078
and I don't want any difficulty
in persuading her to marry our son.

1114
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,076
In persuading her?

1115
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,203
You mean to tell me
you don't want to marry bertie?

1116
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:52,922
I want to marry him, Mrs.
Lenox, I love him.

1117
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,338
In spite of the fact he's
a drunken little fool.

1118
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:58,929
- But after tonight I...
- My son, a drunken little fool?

1119
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:01,389
You realize you're talking of a lenox.

1120
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:03,633
Why, think of your family.

1121
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:06,887
That's just what I'm doing,
my mother would never get over the disgrace

1122
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:08,980
if I married a man like bertie.

1123
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:11,440
My old man would feel the
same way about Marion.

1124
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,856
They've got pretty high standards
back in birdville.

1125
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,774
Why, why, you impertinent...

1126
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:20,025
Oh, sorry, Mrs. lenox, but you see,
I aim to make something out of myself

1127
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,072
and I want a wife I can be proud of.

1128
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:26,995
I see, you mean that my daughter
isn't good enough for you, is that it?

1129
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,834
Oh, she could be good enough if she tried.

1130
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:31,793
You don't understand that girl.

1131
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:34,961
What she needs is to wrestle
with something tough and get sweat on.

1132
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:36,924
- Ohl
- That's what bertie needs too.

1133
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:39,135
Oh, Bronson,
I'm going to be ill, desperately ill.

1134
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:42,005
But it seems to me that if you really
loved them, then you'd realize...

1135
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,007
It wouldn't work, Mr. lenox.

1136
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,758
But I'm depending on you two.

1137
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,431
Stop it, Bronson, are you insane?

1138
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,303
I have been but I've recovered.

1139
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,431
I realized that Marion
and bertie are right.

1140
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,979
These marriages may be
their one big chance.

1141
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:56,444
You haven't recovered,
you're raving mad, Bronson.

1142
01:07:56,447 --> 01:08:01,111
Now listen to me, Carrie, it's going
to take quite a man to manage Marion,

1143
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,235
and Henry seems to be that man.

1144
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:07,956
As for bertie, Alice is the only person
who has any decent influence over him.

1145
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:11,918
I wouldn't have it long, Mr. lenox,
not when bertie has all the money he has.

1146
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,378
If he had something to work for
it would be different.

1147
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:16,418
He loves me enough to do it if he had to.

1148
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,007
But he doesn't have to.

1149
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:20,844
She said a mouthful!
Oh, I like money all right,

1150
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:23,338
but when I'm marrying
I want to be the guy that has it.

1151
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:26,261
Well, how's Marion gonna be a good wife
unless she respects me?

1152
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:29,181
And how is she gonna respect me
if she has more than me?

1153
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:33,056
I see, it all boils itself down to the fact
that you won't marry my children

1154
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,023
because they have money.

1155
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,019
I was gonna be fool enough to do it,

1156
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:41,114
but now I realize what a handful Marion is,
you gotta excuse me.

1157
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,108
That's the way I feel
about it too, Mr. lenox.

1158
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,828
- Why, why...
- Yes.

1159
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:49,243
Your children can't believe it's true,
Mr. lenox.

1160
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:54,165
They refuse to leave their cells unless
these two young people go after them.

1161
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:55,503
It isn't true.

1162
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,498
What do you think, judge summers,
my son and my daughter

1163
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:02,047
have been refused by a chorus girl
and a common laborer.

1164
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,677
They're not good enough for them.

1165
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:07,094
Well, by heavens if they're as worthless as
all that, they're not good enough for me.

1166
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,012
- Bronson.
- What do you mean, sir?

1167
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,056
I mean, that I see them for the first time
as they are:

1168
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:14,852
Selfish, spoiled, useless little fools
without a bit of good in them.

1169
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:18,101
- Don't talk like that about my children.
- No, bertie's not that bad, Mr. lenox.

1170
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:21,070
- Neither is Marion.
- We'll see whether they are or not.

1171
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:23,235
They haven't appreciated
one thing I've done for them.

1172
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,984
All right, let them get out
and make good on their own.

1173
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,156
- Do I understand you right, sir?
- You do

1174
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,496
if you understand that I'm through
with my children.

1175
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,161
I never want to see them again

1176
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,501
and I'll never give them another penny until
I'm sure that they've come to their senses.

1177
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,336
Do you hear that, Henry?

1178
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,171
You ain't got the heart of a rattle snake.

1179
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,008
What you're doing to this poor little girl
is the lowest down, meanest,

1180
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,297
most contemptible thing I
ever heard in my life!

1181
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:48,469
Judge, that wedding's on, I'll show him
how much I care for his rotten money!

1182
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:53,345
So will I, bertie needs me now
and just try and take him away from me.

1183
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,154
What, why, Mr. lenox, you mean that you...

1184
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:07,321
- Why, certainly.
- Masterly, Mr. lenox, masterly.

1185
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,364
You know, there's fine stuff
in those two young people.

1186
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:12,284
- Yes.
- Why, Mrs. lenox.

1187
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:16,125
- I'll get some ammonia.
- Oh, no, don't bother, judge.

1188
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:21,214
Come on, Carrie, it's not going to do you
a bit of good this time.

1189
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:24,880
- What did you say, Bronson?
- You heard me, kid.

1190
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:29,096
- Why, Bronson!
- Yes, yes.

1191
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,308
You know what I mean.

1192
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:35,144
Oh, gee, I love you.

1193
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,639
You're such a fool.
