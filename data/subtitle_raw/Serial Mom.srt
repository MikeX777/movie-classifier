1
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,123
That's a nice dress
you're wearing this morning, Misty.

2
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,287
Thanks, Dad.

3
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,488
Want the
entertainment section?

4
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,532
Not yet, Dad, thanks.

5
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,657
Got any donuts?

6
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:21,757
Of course not, Chip.

7
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,392
You know they're bad for the teeth.

8
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,458
Always the dentist.

9
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,505
Who wants fruit salad?

10
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,665
Oh, I do, please.

11
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,809
Misty, that's not gum
in your mouth, is it?

12
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,402
It's sugarless.

13
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:39,312
Misty, you know how I hate gum.
All that chomping and chewing.

14
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,613
I'm sorry, Mom.

15
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,711
All right.

16
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,415
Hey, Chip.
Mmm?

17
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,515
You think I could get 50 cents
for Village People on vinyl?

18
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,992
You might get a buck.

19
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,461
Carl can't believe how
much I make at swap meets.

20
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,055
Who, may I ask, is Carl?

21
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,394
Just a boy.

22
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,628
He's picking me up
this morning.

23
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,965
Here we go again.

24
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,937
He's really cute.

25
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,099
Misty, cute is not
enough. You know that.

26
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,665
She sure
can pick them.

27
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,371
He goes to college with me.

28
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:10,405
Leave her alone, Chip. I think
it's great Misty's got a new beau.

29
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,347
Chip, honey?

30
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,443
Thanks, Mom.

31
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,114
Listen to this.

32
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,483
"Hillside Strangler gets his
college degree in prison. "

33
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,387
That's nice, dear.

34
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:28,127
Nice? He should
have been executed.

35
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,364
Yeah,
the death penalty.

36
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,564
He killed people, Mom.

37
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,232
We all have
our bad days.

38
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,334
You'd probably date him. "He's cute!"

39
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,740
All right,
that's enough.

40
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,339
<i>Hey, Dad, have you ever seen
Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer?</i>

41
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,577
Oh, sure, Chip.

42
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,643
I most certainly have not.

43
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,949
You've been working in
that video shop too long.

44
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,992
Mind your
own business.

45
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,155
Well, it better hadn't be
interfering with your schoolwork.

46
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,392
I do great
in school, Dad.

47
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,560
Well, your mother
has PTA today.

48
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,570
We'll see what your teacher has to say.

49
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,538
Oh, Mom,
I hate Mr. Stubbins.

50
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,940
Don't say "hate," dear.
Hate is a very serious word.

51
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,516
There! Scrambled eggs, anybody?

52
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,557
Who on earth...

53
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,028
Mrs. Sutphin?
Yes.

54
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,699
I'm Detective Pike.
This is Detective Gracey.

55
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,240
Oh, come in.

56
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,478
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What
seems to be the trouble, Officers?

57
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,983
Is there a killer loose?

58
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,541
No, son.
Nothing that exciting.

59
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,417
Oh, this is our son, Chip,
and our daughter, Misty.

60
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,956
Hi.

61
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,218
Jeez...

62
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,254
Oh.

63
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,226
Officer, I'm sorry, but we
don't allow gum in this house.

64
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,358
Sorry, ma'am.

65
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,834
We're investigating obscene
phone calls and mail threats

66
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,739
to a certain
Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.

67
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:17,798
I know Dottie.

68
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,139
She lives right down the street.

69
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,236
Could you take
a look at this and...

70
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,747
Tell us of anyone who
might be responsible?

71
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:26,214
I should warn you, this
note contains language.

72
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,652
Oh, my!

73
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,461
That...
That is the limit.

74
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,860
Let me see.

75
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,592
No, Son. This is a matter for adults.

76
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,359
Officers, I have never even
said the "P" word out loud,

77
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,598
let alone have written it down.

78
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,140
No woman would.

79
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,371
Officers, life doesn't
have to be ugly.

80
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,913
See, look at
the birds out there.

81
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,778
Listen to their call...

82
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,857
Chip, there's your ride.

83
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,595
Hey, I'm gonna be late
for work. Goodbye, honey.

84
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:17,693
Okay.

85
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,794
Excuse me.

86
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,531
Hi, Scotty.

87
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,836
Thanks for your time, everybody.

88
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,673
Bye, Detective Pike.

89
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,202
Hi, Birdie!

90
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,010
Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Sutphin.

91
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,483
That's Birdie. She's a
horror nut, just like my son.

92
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,589
Oh, Birdie, this is Detective
Gracey and Detective Pike.

93
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:38,646
Hiya, boys.

94
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,351
Bye-bye, honey!

95
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:43,224
Good morning, Scott.

96
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,688
Hey, Misty, look what I
got. A Pee-Wee Herman doll.

97
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,528
Can you sell it for
me at the flea market?

98
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,795
Wow! Still in the box! I sure can!

99
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,404
Oh, God,
here comes Carl.

100
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,203
You must be Mrs. Sutphin. Carl Pageant.

101
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,339
Oh, yes.
Misty's date.

102
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,545
Well, more
of a friend, really.

103
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,844
Take it easy, man. Bye.

104
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,349
See what Birdie gave me
to sell at the flea market?

105
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,585
That guy's a weirdo.
Come on, let's go.

106
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,887
I'll take it.

107
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,231
Bye, Mom.
Bye, honey.

108
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:23,428
Oh, Detectives? Here's something
you should be interested in.

109
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,336
A grown boy who doesn't
wear his seatbelt.

110
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,411
Christ, that one was
Beaver Cleaver's mother.

111
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,413
Oh, leave her alone.

112
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,511
Mrs. Sutphin's about as
normal and nice a lady

113
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,146
as we're ever
gonna find.

114
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,095
Hello?

115
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,004
Is this
the Cocksucker residence?

116
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,236
God damn you!
Stop calling here.

117
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,836
Isn't this
4215 Pussy Way?

118
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:08,938
You bitch!

119
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,916
Now let me check the
zip code. 212-fuck you!

120
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:18,289
Beverly? Beverly, darling? You home?

121
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,721
The police are tracing
this call this very minute.

122
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,955
Well, Dottie Hinkle, then why
aren't they here, huh, fuck-face?

123
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,521
Fuck you!

124
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,331
Beverly, you home?

125
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,434
I know you are.

126
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,111
Beverly?

127
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,574
Hmm.

128
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,892
Didn't I just
say fuck you?

129
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,520
I beg your pardon.

130
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,824
Who is this?

131
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,161
Mrs. Wilson from
the telephone company.

132
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:04,430
I understand you're having problems
with an obscene phone caller?

133
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:08,462
Yes, I am. I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilson,
but this is driving me crazy.

134
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,066
I've had my number
changed twice already.

135
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,134
I'm a divorced woman.
Please help me.

136
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,142
Beverly?

137
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,621
Well, what exactly does this
sick individual say to you?

138
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,994
I can't say the words out
loud. I don't use bad language.

139
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:36,660
Oh, well, I know it's difficult,
but we need to know the exact words.

140
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,033
I'll try.

141
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,997
Cocksucker. That's what she calls me.

142
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,439
Listen to your filthy
mouth, you fucking whore!

143
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,908
God damn you!

144
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,306
Motherfucker.

145
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,080
Cocksucker!

146
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,814
Beverly?
Rosemary.

147
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,287
Are you all right?

148
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,347
Oh, yes, of course. I'm fine.

149
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,753
Oh, how nice.
You remembered.

150
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,761
It's the least
I could do.

151
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,825
I heard shouting.

152
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,265
Oh, it's that
cable TV company.

153
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,064
You know
how they are.

154
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,037
Did you hear about poor Dottie Hinkle?

155
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,096
Yes, I did.
It's terrifying.

156
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,165
The police were at
my house this morning.

157
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,804
Now who on earth would want
to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?

158
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,405
Bye-bye.

159
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,776
But, Mr. Stubbins, my
son studies every night.

160
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,253
He's trying as hard as he can.

161
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,780
Well, some teenagers just aren't
college material, Mrs. Taplotter.

162
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,688
It's nothing
to cry over.

163
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,055
Now, there are
other parents waiting.

164
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,759
Thank you for taking
the time to come to PTA.

165
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,665
Hi, Betty.
Oh, hi, Beverly.

166
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,204
Oh, I love
your outfit.

167
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,432
Oh, thanks.

168
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,838
Hi.
Hi.

169
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,972
Liz Claiborne.

170
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,470
Well, Mrs. Sutphin, where's
that husband of yours?

171
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,174
Feeling a little
down in the mouth?

172
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,446
Oh, Ralph.
You're so funny.

173
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,182
<i>Oh, brother.</i>

174
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,181
Mrs. Sutphin?

175
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,420
Yes, right here.

176
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,201
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul
Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.

177
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,102
Oh, it's so nice
to meet you.

178
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,640
Here's a little something that I made.

179
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,730
Oh.

180
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,112
Fruitcake. Well, thank
you, Mrs. Sutphin.

181
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,613
Have a seat.

182
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,345
Oh, yes.

183
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,147
Well, Chip's off to a
fine start this year.

184
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,418
He's focused, conscientious, he participates
actively in classroom discussions...

185
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,152
He's a good boy.

186
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,056
There is one
big problem, though.

187
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,152
What is it?

188
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,787
His unhealthy obsession
with sick horror films.

189
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,731
Oh, no.

190
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,666
Chip's the assistant
manager at a video store...

191
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,762
That's no excuse
for a morbid imagination.

192
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,468
I caught him drawing
this in class last week.

193
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,145
Is there a problem at home?

194
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,646
Of course not.

195
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,410
Divorce?
Alcoholic relative?

196
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,419
Tell me, did Chip torture
animals when he was young?

197
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,318
No, he did not.

198
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,256
Mr. Stubbins, we are a
loving and supportive family.

199
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,152
Well, you're doing something
wrong, Mrs. Sutphin.

200
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,755
I'd recommend
therapy for your son.

201
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,468
Thank you for taking
the time to come to PTA.

202
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,521
Watch this.
No, thanks.

203
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,720
Scotty, watch this.

204
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,761
It's a sheep's tongue.

205
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,860
This shit is sickening.
Come on, put on some pussy.

206
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,529
Look, dickhead...

207
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,573
<i>Blood Feast.</i>

208
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,542
<i>The Citizen Kane
of gore movies.</i>

209
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,313
I don't know what it is about
today, but I feel great! Cookie?

210
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,446
Excuse me,
Mrs. Sutphin.

211
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,183
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.

212
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,656
Hi, guys.

213
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,723
Look how fake
that looks.

214
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:40,196
Oh, you kids. Here, have
a cookie and run on home.

215
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,630
But, Mom,
the video's not over.

216
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,065
Don't you
"but, Mom" me.

217
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,660
Mr. Stubbins seems to think
that these silly movies

218
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,638
are interfering
with your schoolwork.

219
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,695
Oh, boy.

220
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,238
Mom, Mr. Stubbins sucks.

221
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,177
Man! That one made me puke!

222
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,009
It's supposed
to make you puke.

223
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,015
You forgot something.

224
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,740
Are we leaving?

225
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,410
Yes, you are.

226
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,579
Bye, Mrs. Sutphin.

227
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,951
Bye, Birdie.

228
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,355
Bye, Bird-Brain.
See you, Scotty.

229
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:16,693
Now, Chip, honey, I know how
hard it is being a teenager.

230
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,035
I understand. I'm your
mother and I love you.

231
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,139
Mom...

232
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,436
Oh, could we watch
that scene again?

233
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,742
You know the one, where he
rips her heart out? Please?

234
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,552
Ladies and gentlemen,
the perfect meatloaf.

235
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,060
It looks
good, Mom.

236
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,528
Nothing like a home-cooked meal, honey.

237
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:48,191
Oh, Misty, I made you your
favorite, sesame broccoli.

238
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,167
You know, Carl says if I lose 10 pounds,

239
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,568
he'll take me to the University of
Maryland Memorial Day Beach Blast.

240
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,903
Well, honey, I think that's
great if you wanna lose weight,

241
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,942
but I think you should
do it for yourself,

242
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,069
not for some boy
you hardly even know.

243
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,837
Carl's a jerk.

244
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,815
He certainly drives like a jerk.

245
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,879
Carl makes me happy and that
threatens this family, doesn't it?

246
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,320
It doesn't threaten me,
honey. I'm happy.

247
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,652
I'm happy, too.

248
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,783
We just want
you to be happy.

249
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,829
I'm so happy
I could shit.

250
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,297
Chip, you know how I
hate the brown word.

251
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,996
Beverly! Beverly!

252
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,402
Beverly!

253
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,276
That's Rosemary.
Something must be wrong.

254
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:40,842
Turn on the news. A teacher at
your school has been murdered.

255
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,910
Murdered?
Who?

256
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,385
A Mr. Stuber
or Stubin...

257
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,515
Mr. Stubbins!

258
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:50,353
That's my math teacher. Dad...

259
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:51,987
Which channel?

260
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,463
It's on
all of them!

261
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,166
<i>Police claim the driver
of the hit-and-run vehicle</i>

262
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,966
<i>Ran down the teacher
in cold blood. Hello?</i>

263
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,405
Did you hear?
What happened?

264
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,909
This is so cool. It's
just like a horror movie.

265
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,742
It's on. I'll call you back. Okay, bye.

266
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,180
<i>Mr. Paul Stubbins
was 38 years old.</i>

267
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,309
Whoever did this should
get the death penalty.

268
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:16,684
<i>So far only one eyewitness has surfaced.</i>

269
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,723
<i>Young lady,
what did you see?</i>

270
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,814
<i>It was a blue car.</i>

271
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,484
That's Lu-Ann Hodges.

272
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,822
She's a stoner.

273
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:23,884
A what?

274
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,122
A pothead, Mom.

275
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,461
<i>A blue station wagon.</i>

276
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,330
That's like
your car, Beverly.

277
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,562
Rosemary, I'm not that bad a driver.

278
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,797
<i>...in a second, man.</i>

279
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,601
<i>It flattened Mr. Stubbins
just like a pancake!</i>

280
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,302
<i>Oh, God, man,
puke time, man.</i>

281
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,435
Oh, look
at her hair.

282
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,843
<i>Blood was all over
the place and...</i>

283
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,347
Turn it off, honey.

284
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,018
I can't believe
Mr. Stubbins is dead.

285
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,552
You said
you hated him.

286
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,078
Well, he was an asshole,
but he didn't deserve to die.

287
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,987
I can't stop thinking
about that poor teacher.

288
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:06,300
Well, good night, honey.

289
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,360
Good night, dear.

290
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,872
Don't read
too late.

291
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,168
We've got a big day
with the birds tomorrow.

292
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,268
Oh, I've identified

293
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,610
every little birdie that we're gonna
see tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.

294
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,646
Good night, honey.

295
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,222
Hey, don't I get
a good night kiss?

296
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,893
I thought with all this
sadness, you wouldn't wanna...

297
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:35,491
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.

298
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,335
It's all right
with me, Beverly.

299
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,604
You want to, honey?

300
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,847
You think
the kids are awake?

301
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,715
We could be
very quiet.

302
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,884
I love that
you're my wife.

303
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,718
You're not so bad yourself, cuckoo bird.

304
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,849
You bring me
such peace.

305
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,005
Don't wake
the kids.

306
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,546
Oh, honey,
you are hot tonight.

307
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,740
Oh, yeah!

308
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,544
Quiet!

309
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,749
Oh, yeah!

310
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,219
Yeah!

311
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,555
Oh, get it! Honey, I'm ready!

312
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,695
Now! Now...

313
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:45,362
Oh, yeah! Yes!

314
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,367
Now!

315
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:57,506
Oh, there's DeeDee. Oh,
she's my favorite starling.

316
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,942
She's here every morning for breakfast.

317
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:03,545
Well, honey, starlings are
originally from Europe, you know.

318
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:04,850
No wonder
DeeDee's hungry.

319
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:08,120
It's a long journey all
the way here to Baltimore.

320
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,028
Hello?

321
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,094
Eugene,
this is Ralph Sterner.

322
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,538
I've got a
dental emergency here.

323
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,371
I mean, this goddamn
tooth is killing me.

324
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,774
Well, Mr. Sterner, if
you'll just call my office,

325
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,837
I'm sure we can see you on Monday.

326
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,315
Monday?

327
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,352
Eugene, this is Betty Sterner.

328
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,545
He'll die
by Monday.

329
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,144
I mean, the roots are infected.

330
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,850
He might have
a heart attack.

331
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,416
All right, Mrs. Sterner. 10:00.

332
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:47,354
I'm sorry, honey, but the birds
will still be there next week.

333
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,757
It's okay.
I understand.

334
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,368
I'll go
fix breakfast.

335
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,173
Chip!

336
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,684
God! Mom,
what's the matter?

337
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,220
Oh, it's just time
to get up, that's all.

338
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,982
I don't want you
to be late for work.

339
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,523
You scared me.

340
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,026
Misty, honey,
what's wrong?

341
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,527
I'm stood up.

342
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,393
I'll kill
that bastard.

343
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,928
I mean it.

344
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,368
He should be dead, that lousy creep.

345
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,930
He told me he'd be here. I'll kill him.

346
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:35,679
Don't use words unless you
mean them, Misty, honey.

347
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,646
It's him!

348
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,275
No, no.
It's the police.

349
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,288
Good morning, Officers.

350
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,521
Good morning,
Mrs. Sutphin.

351
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,325
Hi, Detective Pike.

352
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,490
Morning, Misty.

353
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,396
Mrs. Sutphin, I presume you know
about the death of Mr. Stubbins.

354
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,702
Oh, yes, yes. A fine
man, a good teacher.

355
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,836
Contusions, fractures, rupture
of numerous vital organs.

356
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,645
What a mess.

357
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,016
Oh, no, no, honey.
That's Scotty.

358
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,983
Scotty, who doesn't
wear his seatbelt.

359
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,784
Good morning, Detectives.

360
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,617
<i>Nightmare on
Calverton Court.</i>

361
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,925
<i>The Maryland
Teacher Massacre.</i>

362
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,487
It's not funny, son.

363
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,061
Did you drive your car to the PTA
meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?

364
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,398
Yes, I did.

365
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,271
Detectives, what is this all about?

366
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,902
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin,

367
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,809
but the Department of Motor
Vehicles computer shows

368
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,404
only one blue
station wagon

369
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:47,179
registered to a parent of
any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.

370
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,846
Surely, you don't think that
Beverly was involved in this?

371
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,115
She did it!

372
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,657
Aimed the car right at Mr.
Stubbins and mowed him down!

373
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,154
Shut up,
Scotty.

374
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:04,898
Well, as I understand it, the
only eyewitness was a drug user.

375
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,098
I got somebody you
could run over, Mother.

376
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,903
Misty, that's
a terrible thing to say.

377
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,107
Detectives, it's time for you to leave.

378
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,406
My wife knows nothing about
this terrible accident.

379
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,915
Murder, honey.

380
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:22,385
Oh! Now here's a babe.

381
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,547
Let's see that,
young man.

382
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,126
"P," as in...

383
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,220
People who don't mind
their own business.

384
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,731
Darling,
it's Rosemary Ackerman's.

385
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,736
Oh, you can tell
by the subscription label.

386
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:42,364
I don't like to read about
movies. They're so violent.

387
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,170
Besides, I always recycle my magazines.

388
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,389
<i>daybreak if you wanna believe</i>

389
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:11,959
<i>It can be daybreak
Ain't no time to grieve</i>

390
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:16,269
<i>'Cause it's daybreak
If you'll only believe</i>

391
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:20,334
<i>And let it shine,
shine, shine</i>

392
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:56,304
Wait for me, boys! Here! All
rinsed and ready to recycle.

393
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:57,773
Morning,
Mrs. Sutphin.

394
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,647
Good morning, Gus.
Good morning, Sloppy.

395
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,653
You know, you boys work so
hard for the environment,

396
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,211
I thought I'd bring you something.

397
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,018
A little drink
never hurt anybody.

398
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,718
Thank you, ma'am.

399
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,154
Damn,
that's good stuff.

400
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,788
You believe that goddamn litterbugger?

401
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,832
I have told her
and told her.

402
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:21,429
It takes 90 to 100 years
for a tin can to decompose

403
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,701
and she still
won't recycle.

404
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,243
It cost the taxpayers
millions of dollars last year,

405
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,712
but she don't care nothing
about the national budget.

406
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,306
I hate Mrs. Ackerman.

407
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,749
I hate her, too.

408
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,376
I hate her guts.

409
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,422
You know, somebody ought to kill her.

410
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,657
Yeah.

411
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:41,714
Give her a

412
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:46,092
Happy face,
and then recycle her.

413
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,831
For the sake of this
planet, somebody just might.

414
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,667
<i>But your boyfriend was
convicted of killing 12 people.</i>

415
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,004
<i>I don't judge him.</i>

416
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,445
<i>I just don't get it. I mean,
how can you love a mass murderer?</i>

417
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,976
<i>Easy. He's handsome, he's famous
and we get conjugal visits.</i>

418
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,321
<i>Serial hags. Women who
love men who mutilate.</i>

419
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,485
<i>We'll be right back after
this, so please stay tuned.</i>

420
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:20,361
Turn it off. Violence
is everywhere these days.

421
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,491
It's just Beverly.

422
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,262
Come in, Beverly!

423
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,064
Oh, she scared me.

424
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,570
Hi!
Hi, Rosemary.

425
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:28,663
Would you
like a beer?

426
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,607
Oh, no, no. Not me. Thank
you. Just a little coffee.

427
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:35,134
Oh, Dottie, I'm so sorry.
I heard about your troubles.

428
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,407
It's not fair.

429
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:37,675
No.

430
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,117
Mmm. Oh, thank you.

431
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,186
Are those
pussy willows?

432
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,519
Dried ones.

433
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:49,958
Aren't they pretty?

434
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,155
What did you
just say?

435
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,960
Pussy willows, Dottie.

436
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,998
Oh, my goodness!
What are you doing?

437
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,231
I didn't do it!

438
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,501
My Franklin Mint
Fabergé egg!

439
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,042
Dottie didn't mean to
be such a clumsy ox.

440
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,509
You're sorry
aren't you, Dottie?

441
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,603
Rosemary, I did not break your egg!

442
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,942
She did!

443
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,141
Dottie, you could
at least apologize.

444
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,809
I collect Franklin Mint!

445
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,284
Well, we'll go right
to the antique market

446
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:16,786
and we'll find
you another one.

447
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:20,484
Now, Misty tells me there's a whole
booth filled with Franklin Mint stuff.

448
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:22,185
But... Dottie, you'll
lock up, won't you?

449
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,751
But... But... I'll take
care of poor Rosemary.

450
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:28,128
But I heard her voice. It's her!

451
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,443
Mr. Sterner, you've lost a tiny filling.

452
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:43,538
I have to drill deeply enough
to remove all the decay.

453
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,914
All right, go ahead, but
be careful. It really hurts.

454
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:53,320
Open... Wider... Very wide.

455
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:10,005
Mrs. Sterner, you can't go
back there. Mrs. Sterner...

456
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,441
God damn you! You're trying
to hurt me on purpose.

457
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,944
Are you okay, Ralph?

458
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,379
Mrs. Sterner, please
stay in the waiting room.

459
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:21,407
<i>Help me, Betty, he's worse than
the dentist in The Marathon Man.</i>

460
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,953
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Doctor Sutphin,

461
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,182
but there are
two police detectives

462
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:27,315
waiting to see you
in your office.

463
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,355
Fine.

464
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,829
Good morning.
What is it, Officers?

465
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,332
My patient
is waiting.

466
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:39,097
Doctor Sutphin, is
your wife a big reader?

467
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,865
Bird books, mostly.

468
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,600
Like these we found in her garbage.

469
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,370
<i>Urge to Kill, Mass Murder in Houston?</i>

470
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,434
I'm sure those are my son Chip's books.

471
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,173
No, they're your wife's.

472
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,441
We checked.

473
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,007
She bought them at the
Browse and Learn Book Shop,

474
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,484
along with
a few other titles.

475
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:58,181
<i>Helter Skelter.
Hunting Humans.</i>

476
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,588
MasterCard reference number 7876,

477
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:03,286
dated February 5th.

478
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,453
This is ridiculous!

479
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,758
Doctor Sutphin,
is your wife mental?

480
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,271
Damn these gnats.
I hate them.

481
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,274
Always something, isn't
it? Can I help you?

482
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,706
Thanks for not
buying anything.

483
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:24,179
Misty, honey.
Now lighten up.

484
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,707
It's not the customer's fault
that Carl stood you up.

485
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,021
Young man, this Fabergé egg is chipped.

486
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,191
Yes, ma'am, it is.

487
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,395
I'll give you $50.

488
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:47,438
That's a Franklin Mint piece. $100.

489
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,941
$100? Franklin Mint or not,
that's damaged goods.

490
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:57,507
Hello. This
is a very special doll.

491
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:04,712
This veil is from a gown that came
from a bride who was left at the altar.

492
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,217
Only one of its kind.

493
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,386
I'll take this
instead.

494
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,794
Oh, that's
a nice one, huh?

495
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,129
Itll be cold
before you know it.

496
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:20,467
$3? I guess that's how
I must have marked it.

497
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,303
Thank you.
Thank you.

498
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,040
Did you find your Franklin
Mint egg, Rosemary, darling?

499
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,053
Well, I saw one, but it
was really overpriced.

500
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,487
Oh, want me to keep this
under the table for you?

501
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:42,025
If you don't mind.
It was on sale.

502
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,889
Oh, Franklin Mint.

503
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,767
Honey, please,
for my bedroom shelf.

504
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,947
Okay. Wrap it up
for the little lady.

505
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,841
Here you go.
Thank you.

506
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,431
I'm thirsty.

507
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,801
What do you want?

508
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,106
The Colts.

509
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,017
Banner, please.
Thank you.

510
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,353
Honey, I have to
take a piss.

511
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,185
There you go.

512
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,695
I can't believe it.
It's fucking Don Knotts.

513
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,754
He's the coolest. Thanks. Bye.

514
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:38,268
Honey! Look!
I made a killing.

515
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,646
Mom,
watch the booth.

516
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:53,775
I want to see
what's going on.

517
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,182
Sure.

518
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,281
I hope
nothing's wrong.

519
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,347
Beverly, honey,

520
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:04,121
you've got some
doo-doo on your shoe.

521
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:11,223
I hate that.

522
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,673
There was a lady in
the men's room, I swear.

523
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,301
A pretty little lady in
the stall right next to me.

524
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,251
She must
know him.

525
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,552
Carl!

526
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,533
What happened?
I don't know...

527
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,531
That's $158.

528
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,244
New York money
good enough for you?

529
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:56,541
Certainly.

530
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,681
Thank you.

531
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,277
Mother!
Mother, it's Carl.

532
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,849
He's dead.

533
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,185
How horrible.

534
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,689
Oh, I just sold
the Pee-Wee Herman doll.

535
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,193
Mother, didn't you hear me?

536
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:15,358
Someone murdered Carl in the men's
room. I just saw his dead body.

537
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,526
You got your wish, dear.

538
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:25,504
I didn't wish that.
I didn't want him dead.

539
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,896
<i>Beverly, it's me, Ted Bundy.</i>

540
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,562
<i>It's late at night, six
days before my execution</i>

541
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,571
<i>and it's lonely here
on death row.</i>

542
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,836
<i>Updating
the story of the hour,</i>

543
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,002
<i>the young man
brutally murdered</i>

544
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,477
<i>a short time ago

545
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:36,944
<i>of the Antique Traders Mart</i>

546
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:41,244
<i>has been identified as
22-year-old Carl Pageant of Towson.</i>

547
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,971
No, no,
no! No!

548
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:10,647
Chip! Our mother is Charles Manson.

549
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,481
I'm not kidding.

550
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,610
Carl stood me up
this morning

551
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,483
and then he was murdered
at the flea market.

552
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,455
Murdered?
Yes, murdered!

553
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,215
You said you hated
your teacher yesterday

554
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,589
and he was murdered, too.

555
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,924
Look, I don't know.
Maybe Mom's nuts.

556
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,724
That's a cool idea, Misty.

557
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,857
Hey, let's make a gore movie
about Mom, better yet, a TV series.

558
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,127
Hey, can I
borrow your mother?

559
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,465
My aunt's coming over for dinner

560
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,664
and she's always
getting on my nerves.

561
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,900
My stepfather's
an asshole.

562
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,635
She could kill him. 
- How about Mrs. Ackerman?

563
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,576
We all hate her. Who's
gonna be the next victim?

564
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:44,637
No, stop it!
It's not funny.

565
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:50,219
Mom might do it.
Somebody else might die.

566
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,387
Dinner is served.

567
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,795
Let's say grace and
pray for the strength

568
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,662
to understand
the terrible tragedies

569
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,325
of the last few days.

570
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,563
Amen to that.

571
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,070
It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?

572
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,909
Bless, O Lord, this food to our
use and our self to thy service.

573
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,341
Amen.
Amen.

574
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,915
Amen.
Amen.

575
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,351
Hungry, honey?

576
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:26,719
Dottie Hinkle was right.
It is Beverly Sutphin.

577
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,420
I tell you, I saw blood right
there on the bottom of her shoes.

578
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:35,789
Not exactly blood... It was gore,
hanging there like a runny nose.

579
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:41,337
Nice as pie, she was to me.
And then I hear her say it.

580
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:43,066
Say what, ma'am?

581
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:47,904
"Are those... " I can't
say the word out loud.

582
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,070
Could you tell
a policewoman

583
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,579
the exact words
she used?

584
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:51,945
Maybe.

585
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,516
It's okay. Nobody's gonna hurt you.

586
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,579
Come on.
Let it out.

587
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:03,093
"Pussy," that's what she
said to me. "Pussy willows. "

588
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,927
You know, Mom...
Mmm?

589
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,368
Scotty thinks
you're the killer.

590
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:17,971
Does he?

591
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,205
You know, for somebody who
doesn't wear his seatbelt,

592
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:23,110
Scotty sure is nosy.

593
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,149
Oh, just a second.

594
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:05,646
She's gone!

595
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,793
She's gonna
kill Scotty!

596
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,294
Get in the car,
both of you.

597
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,955
Dad, you don't think
she did it, do you?

598
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,295
I do.
Mom's gone crazy.

599
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,994
Your mother may have some
problems. That's all, Chip.

600
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,730
Come on, hurry.

601
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:43,849
Detective Gracey
and all units.

602
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,260
Suspect's family headed
east on Calverton.

603
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,725
Repeat, east on Calverton.

604
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,289
Turn right on
Timonium Road, Dad.

605
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,130
I will, I will.
Hurry.

606
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:06,612
<i>daybreak If you'll only believe</i>

607
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:11,121
<i>It can be daybreak
Ain't no time to grieve</i>

608
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:14,521
<i>'Cause it's daybreak
If you'll only believe</i>

609
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,959
<i>And let it shine,
shine, shine...</i>

610
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:36,210
If Mom is psycho, Scotty
will still be okay, won't he?

611
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,642
We hope so, Son.

612
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:42,709
And no matter what your mother
is, we'll love her anyway.

613
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:55,123
This is Scotty's, Dad. His
parents aren't home. Come on.

614
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,455
Scotty?

615
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,849
What was that?

616
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,283
I didn't
hear anything.

617
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:24,247
Got any dessert?

618
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:27,722
Doctor Sutphin said
no sweets for you.

619
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,554
Yeah, well,
what's he know?

620
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:31,389
How to send a bill!

621
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:39,629
I'll get the door.

622
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,997
Suspect's family
entering house.

623
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,371
Send backup
to 400 Sycamore Street.

624
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,204
I have a feeling
old Mom's inside.

625
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:58,244
<i>Wheel of Fortune!</i>

626
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:02,689
<i>Ralph, Wheel of Fortune's on!</i>

627
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,988

630
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,857
<i>May I have a "P"?</i>

631
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,664
<i>Mmm-hmm.

632
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,333
Ralph!

633
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,900
What is it, Betty?

634
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,673
I think we've got
mice or something.

635
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,114
No, no, no. We paid the exterminator.

636
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:14,619
Betty?

637
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,031
It's upstairs.

638
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,207
I'm going in. Over.

639
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:36,446
It's the door
on the left.

640
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,516
Break it down, Dad.
Break it down!

641
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,297
Scotty, man...

642
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,730
Police! Freeze!

643
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:56,732
Betty? Betty, answer me!

644
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,800
Ralph...

645
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:21,187
Help! Help me! Help me, please! Please!

646
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,395
Help me, somebody!

647
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:38,712
Home, sweet home!
Everything's fine, kids.

648
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,841
I can't believe I thought my
own mother was a murderess.

649
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,978
I'm kind of disappointed she isn't.

650
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:46,022
For a while there it was
like being in the movies.

651
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:49,388
Anybody for dessert?
Mmm. Strawberries.

652
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,273
Let's go.

653
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:44,045
Dad, you said it would be
okay. Make them go away.

654
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:45,308
This is embarrassing.

655
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:47,043
Just pay no attention to the police.

656
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:48,744
It's all
a terrible mistake.

nowhere this time.

Tell me the truth, Mom.
Really, it's okay with me.

Are you a serial killer?

686
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:21,771

anything about is Rice Krispies.

Can you come...

00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,227
We said no,
remember?

696
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,768
Birdie, please, you can't
talk to him. Now, please...

697
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:21,898
Stay with us, honey.

698
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:26,037
She's awful!
She can't stay here.

699
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:27,904
Good morning, ladies.

700
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,108
So tell me, Mrs. Sutphin,
are you Serial Mom?

701
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:34,946
What?
No comment.

702
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:39,478
Serial Mom! Wow!

703
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,421
She's headed in, over.

704
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:20,820
Please stand.

705
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:28,929
Blessed be God, Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.

706
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:32,771
And blessed be his
kingdom, now and forever.

707
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:34,036
Amen.

708
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,704
Hallelujah!
Christ has risen.

709
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,010
The Lord
is risen indeed.

710
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:40,174
Hallelujah.

711
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,481
Bless the Lord, who
forgiveth all our sins...

712
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,817
<i>This is Captain
Luecker from Homicide.</i>

713
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,653
<i>Lab reports confirm Sutphin
latent print of index finger</i>

714
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,783
<i>on true-crime book</i>

715
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:52,692
<i>matches those latent prints
lifted from murder weapons.</i>

716
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:55,560
<i>Bingo, boys!
Bust the bitch!</i>

717
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:56,656
Copy.

718
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:05,701
Jesus said nothing to
condemn capital punishment

719
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,266
as he hung on the cross, did he?

720
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:09,704
No...

721
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:15,046
If ever there was a time to go on
record against the death penalty,

722
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:16,983
wasn't it that night?

723
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:22,983
Capital punishment is already
the law in the state of Maryland.

724
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:29,427
So what are we waiting for, fellow
Christians? Let's just do it.

725
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,561
Amen!

726
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:34,792
How you doing?

727
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:35,963
All standing.

728
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:43,309
Let us pray and humbly confess
our sins unto Almighty God.

729
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:48,147
Most merciful God, we confess
that we have sinned against thee,

730
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:55,124
by what we have done and by what we
have left undone. We are truly sorry

731
00:54:55,191 --> 00:55:00,390
and we humbly repent so that
we may delight in thy will

732
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:05,230
and walk in thy ways
to the glory of thy name.

733
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,293
Amen.

734
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:23,279
Beverly? Beverly!

735
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,317
Misty? Beverly?

736
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:32,952
There she is!

737
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:37,125
Beverly!
Misty! Misty...

738
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:38,691
Misty! Come on...

739
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,897
You guys, come on!
Come on, come on, come on!

740
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:45,998
Please, Mrs. Sutphin.
Hurry... Get in...

741
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:52,037
<i>We'll show them, Mom!
We'll go on 60 Minutes!</i>

742
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:56,016
You know, you're bigger
than Freddy and Jason now,

743
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,678
only you're
a real person!

744
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,085
Do you think
I need a lawyer?

745
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:00,588
You need
an agent.

746
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:01,954
An agent?

747
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,967
Hey! Hey!

748
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,606
Is your wife a murderess?
No comment!

749
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:21,576
Please, my wife is missing.
I'm worried sick about her!

750
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,110
Hey... Hey, Misty.

751
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:26,975
<i>Just a couple of shots, okay? I'm
Howell Hawkins from the Baltimore Sun.</i>

752
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,540
Hi, Howell.

753
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,745
Misty Sutphin,
get in this car!

754
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,529
We're tailing
Sutphin husband and daughter

755
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,303
but Serial Mom
is nowhere in sight.

756
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:56,402
She got away, boys!
God damn it! Find her!

757
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:59,213
In here, Mom.
But, Chip...

758
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:00,943
Come on, Mom,
I have to open...

759
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:02,678
Oh, now,
this is so silly.

760
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,276
Bye, Mom.

761
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,948
Customers! Get the door.

762
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,587
Good morning,
Mrs. Jenson.

763
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:12,787
Good morning.

764
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,631
Haven't you had enough
violence, Chip Sutphin?

765
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:28,001
Turn that filth off.

766
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:29,271
Sorry, ma'am.

767
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:32,110
<i>Do you have
the musical, Annie?</i>

768
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:36,082
<i>Sure do. Did you bring back Ghost Dad?</i>

769
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,476
There you go.

770
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:41,388
I just love
Bill Cosby pictures.

771
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,255
Miss Jenson,
I've told you,

772
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:46,227
you have to rewind the
tapes before returning them.

773
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,285
Why?

774
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:48,921
Because
it's the rules.

775
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:51,489
I don't feel like
rewinding them.

776
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:55,462
You see that sign? It's a
dollar fine for not rewinding

777
00:57:55,538 --> 00:58:01,704
and this time I'm gonna charge
you. $2.99 plus $1 is $3.99.

778
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:05,373
Keep the change,
you son of a psycho!

779
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,110
What a bitch!

780
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:12,086
It's the influence of all
those family films. Right, Mom?

781
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,848
Hey, Mom!
Mrs. Sutphin?

782
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,955
Mother? Mother?

783
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:22,862
Oh, shit!

784
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:24,497
You don't think she
would... She wouldn't...

785
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:26,694
What's Miss Jenson's address?

786
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:30,062
Jenkins... Jenson. Emma
Lou Jenson, 19 Clark Avenue.

787
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,333
That's right up
the street.

788
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:33,307
Come on,
just in case.

789
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,303
Come on, Birdie,
let's go!

790
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:29,162
<i>What is it, Sylvester? A birdie?
Shh. Mommy's watching Annie.</i>

791
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:34,199
<i>The sun'll come out
Tomorrow</i>

792
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:37,000
<i>Bet your bottom
dollar that tomorrow</i>

793
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:40,974
Quiet, Sylvester!
Nobody's there.

794
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:44,843
Come on,
lick Mommy's feet.

795
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,948
Get them all wet.

796
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:51,585
<i>And the sorrow
Till there's none</i>

797
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,216
Come on, Birdie.
Come on.

798
00:59:58,761 --> 00:59:59,750
Number 19.

799
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,456
That's it.
Come on.

800
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:10,997
Over here!
Chip, over here!

801
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,505
<i>Tomorrow</i>

802
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:16,306
<i>So you gotta hang on
Till tomorrow</i>

803
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:17,839
<i>Come what may</i>

804
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:20,041
Come on...

805
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,552
<i>Just thinking about
Tomorrow</i>

806
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:28,250
<i>Clears away the cobwebs
And the sorrow</i>

807
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:31,157
<i>Till there's none!</i>

808
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,653
<i>When I'm stuck with a day</i>

809
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,631
<i>That's gray
And Lonely</i>

810
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:40,632
<i>I just stick out my chin
And grin and say</i>

811
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:43,297
Get up there, get up
there. Is she in there?

812
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:46,638
<i>Oh!</i>

813
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:50,304
<i>The sun'll come out
Tomorrow</i>

814
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:54,908
<i>So you gotta hang on
Till tomorrow</i>

815
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:58,010
<i>Come what may</i>

816
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:01,113
<i>Tomorrow! Tomorrow!</i>

817
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:04,182
<i>I love you, tomorrow!</i>

818
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,024
<i>She's singing Annie.</i>

819
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:13,594
<i>The sun'll come out
Tomorrow</i>

820
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:18,369
<i>So you gotta hang on
Till tomorrow</i>

821
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:21,410
<i>Come what may</i>

822
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:24,469
<i>Tomorrow! Tomorrow!</i>

823
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:27,482
<i>I love you, tomorrow!</i>

824
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:32,283
<i>You're only a day away</i>

825
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,806
Rewind!

826
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,377
Oh, my God! No!

827
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:37,012
I saw blood,
and it's brown!

828
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,486
It's not red like in the
horror movies, but brown!

829
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:41,045
Is Mom in there?
No!

830
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:46,061
It wasn't like the gore
movies at all! It was real.

831
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,268
Come on! Birdie, let's cut through here!

832
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:16,155
Wear your seatbelt!
It's the law!

833
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,967
Out, please.
What the fuck?

834
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:30,733
Yes, ma'am.

835
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:48,821
Dear God, I promise I'll never
watch another sex film again!

836
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:50,916
I promise! I promise!

837
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,121
It's okay.

838
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:28,889
Dad! Dad...

839
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,188
Have you seen Mom?

840
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:32,825
No, have you?

841
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,034
Scotty?

842
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:41,999
Oh, my God!

843
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:44,773
Get in!

844
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:03,427
All units, Serial Mom is
headed south on Keswick.

845
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:06,866
Proceed with caution. She
is armed and fucking nuts!

846
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:26,277
Oh, shit!

847
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:54,475
Mike! Mike!
Let me in, okay?

848
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:55,847
Hey! ID.

849
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:56,907
Can I give it
to you inside?

850
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:59,477
Hey, buddy, nobody gets in without ID.

851
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:02,212
Birth date?

852
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,259
December 14, 1972.

853
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,318
Please!

854
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:08,920
Okay, go ahead.

855
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:18,764
<i>I won't flinch
and I won't break a sweat</i>

856
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:22,072
<i>When I taste
the cyanide gas</i>

857
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,408
<i>Gas, gas</i>

858
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:33,050
<i>Only way you're gonna shut me up</i>

859
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,060
Hey!
Excuse me.

860
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:41,960
Excuse me. Hey, look, it's her.

861
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:43,328
Excuse me. Excuse me. Who?

862
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:45,162
It's the murder lady,
the one on TV.

863
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:47,361
Excuse me. Cool. Is she in a band?

864
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:50,530
<i>Watch me wither
through the glass</i>

865
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:53,302
<i>Smiling as I sip
the last gas</i>

866
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:56,739
<i>Justifiable homicide</i>

867
01:06:56,879 --> 01:06:59,939
<i>Almond blossom-scented cyanide</i>

868
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:03,951
<i>Gas chamber</i>

869
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,681
The police are after me.
I beg your pardon.

870
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,620
Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

871
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:11,057
Hey...
You're Serial Mom.

872
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:12,253
Yes, I guess I am.

873
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,090
Well, come on in,
lady. Quick!

874
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:19,328
<i>...you'll keep me down Only way
you think you'll keep me down</i>

875
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:25,733
Coming through.
Thank you.

876
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,013
Help. Help!

877
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:37,147
Excuse me, please.

878
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:49,123
I think maybe you better lock the car.

879
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:51,189
Can't stop now. Is my mom in there?

880
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:52,928
Dad, now, look cool.
It's Hammerjacks.

881
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:58,906
Excuse me.

882
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:05,079
Kids! Put me down!
Put me down!

883
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:10,546
<i>Your God says
thou shalt not kill</i>

884
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,780
<i>But here you are
dropping the pill</i>

885
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,914
<i>Legal system,
what a sham</i>

886
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:17,015
Put me down!

887
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,893
<i>Flying colors
on the final exam</i>

888
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:23,228
<i>Gas chamber</i>

889
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:33,271
<i>Gas chamber</i>

890
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:39,279
<i>Only way you're gonna shut me up</i>

891
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:41,277
Buckle up, Scotty!

892
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:48,482
Oh! Mrs. Sutphin! No! I'll
wear my seatbelt, Mrs. Sutphin.

893
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:56,456
Holy fucking shit!

894
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:23,113
Hi!

895
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:35,699
Move it!
You're under arrest!

896
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:42,272
Honey?
Shut up.

897
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:06,099
Serial Mom! Serial Mom!

898
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:10,798
Serial Mom! Serial Mom! Serial
Mom! Serial Mom! Serial Mom!

899
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:16,470
Serial Mom! Serial Mom! Serial Mom!
Serial Mom! Serial Mom! Serial Mom!

900
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:22,105
Can she
get a fair jury?

901
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:23,208
Misty!
Look this way!

902
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:24,309
Please just
let us through.

903
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:25,876
...your wife's innocence,
Mr. Sutphin? Please!

904
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,150
How does it feel
to have a killer mom?

905
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:31,057
Mr. Sutphin, how does your wife feel?

906
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,354
Beverly is devastated

907
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:33,793
by the charges
against her.

908
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:36,262
<i>Just now I found a peanut</i>

909
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:38,266
<i>Found a peanut, right now</i>

910
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:40,697
<i>Cracked it open,
cracked it open</i>

911
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:42,930
<i>Cracked it open
just now...</i>

912
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:44,063
Didn't I see you
at Hinckley?

913
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:46,130
I was there.
I thought so.

914
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:47,707
My husband thought
I was crazy.

915
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:48,800
She is.

916
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:51,710
Today we're covering day one
of the trial of Serial Mom...

917
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,441
Look!
Here they come!

918
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:58,251
Stop the violence? What is
this? Who are you working for?

919
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:01,722
What do you think
her chances are?

920
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:03,985
Excuse me!
Mr. Sutphin! Coming through.

921
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:09,595
Quiet in the courtroom.
This court is now in session.

922
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:15,568
Oh, hello, jury people.
I'm Beverly Sutphin.

923
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:16,935
Oh, I like
your jacket.

924
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:19,167
Mrs. Sutphin,
I said quiet.

925
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:23,907
Honey, hi! Oh, kids, are
you doing your homework?

926
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:26,379
You are accused
of multiple murders.

927
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,611
This is a court of law,
not a coffee klatch.

928
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:31,812
Mr. Nazlerod,
your opening statement.

929
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,486
Thank you, Your Honor.

930
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:38,450
Good morning, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury.

931
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:42,088
My name is Timothy Nazlerod
and I hope we can be friends.

932
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:45,499
I have to tell you at the outset,

933
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:48,502
however, that this is not a pretty case.

934
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:51,504
This defendant,
Beverly Sutphin,

935
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:54,098
is a woman
evil to the core,

936
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,167
a rotten apple,
if you will,

937
01:11:56,245 --> 01:12:01,649
who beyond any reasonable doubt
killed six innocent people.

938
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,945
That's right,
she murdered them.

939
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,954
Well, they sort of deserved it. Shh.

940
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:09,957
Evilly and with
full premeditation,

941
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:13,656
with a speeding car,
a fire poker,

942
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:18,629
A pair of scissors,
a toppled air conditioner,

943
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,931
the lethal flames
from an aerosol can

944
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:26,536
and yes, even a leg of lamb.

945
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:33,380
Ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, this defendant,

946
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:37,684
this Beverly Sutphin,
she is not a woman.

947
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:41,716
She is a monster!

948
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,358
Defense attorney, your
opening statement for the jury?

949
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:49,624
And let's not
take all day, either.

950
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:56,732
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Herbie Hebden

951
01:12:56,805 --> 01:13:00,070
and you and I have a
tough job ahead of us.

952
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:03,441
I've known the Sutphin
family for 16 years.

953
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:06,413
Dad, Eugene,
is my dentist.

954
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:09,679
Chip and Misty played
with my own children.

955
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:13,777
But I found out that I don't
know Beverly Sutphin at all.

956
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:15,514
Psst.

957
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:18,685
No one really knows
Beverly Sutphin. You see...

958
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:19,750
Psst.

959
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:31,838
Beverly Sutphin
is insane.

960
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,872
Yes, she committed
these terrible crimes,

961
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:37,275
but that doesn't make her a bad person.

962
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:40,543
Your Honor, I would
like to make a motion.

963
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:43,176
I wish to fire my
attorney and defend myself.

964
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:47,446
Beverly Sutphin is not
guilty by reason of insanity.

965
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:51,015
Your Honor, I have the right to
defend myself. I've read the law books.

966
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:56,622
<i>Ware v. State, 1964
and Schuette v. State, 1962.</i>

967
01:13:57,533 --> 01:14:02,470
Mrs. Sutphin, the defendant who has herself
for a lawyer has a fool for a client.

968
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:05,402
Counsel, approach the bench.

969
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,709
I don't think
this is a good idea.

970
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:12,246
Oh, yeah. Oh, no. It's okay.

971
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:15,340
That's my ruling.
Thank you very much.

972
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:18,215
Mrs. Sutphin,
I have no legal choice

973
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,448
but to let you take over
as your own attorney.

974
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:24,219
How do you plead?

975
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,259
Not guilty,
Your Honor.

976
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:31,828
Order! Order in the courtroom.

977
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:35,495
Quiet down or I'll clear this room out!

978
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:39,533
I call to the stand
Dottie Hinkle.

979
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:55,487
Raise your right hand, please.

980
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:58,492
Do you hereby solemnly swear or
affirm under the penalties of perjury

981
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,425
that the testimony you are
about to give will be the truth,

982
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,157
the whole truth and
nothing but the truth? I do.

983
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:03,596
Thank you.

984
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:09,828
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive
any obscene telephone calls?

985
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,133
I certainly did.

986
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:13,731
And did you recognize
the voice of the caller?

987
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,237
Not at first.

988
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:16,777
But then I heard
the same inflection

989
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:18,813
in a voice
at a social gathering.

990
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:21,076
And I put two and two together.

991
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:24,078
Whose voice
was it, Dottie?

992
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:29,588
It was her, Beverly
Sutphin, sitting right there.

993
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,716
I'm lucky
I'm not dead.

994
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,362
Mrs. Hinkle,
do you drink?

995
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:41,129
No, I don't.

996
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:42,665
So you were not drunk

997
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:46,572
when you received those
allegedly obscene phone calls?

998
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:48,308
I certainly was not.

999
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:52,143
Now, you mean to tell me that the
day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's,

1000
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:55,445
the day you claim
you recognized my voice,

1001
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:56,950
you were not drinking?

1002
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:59,510
One beer with lunch
is hardly drinking.

1003
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:03,784
So you do drink?

1004
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:06,054
Socially.
I'll have a beer.

1005
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:08,424
So you admit
you just lied.

1006
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:09,987
No, I don't,
you bitch!

1007
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:12,395
Watch your mouth,
Mrs. Hinkle.

1008
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:18,439
Did you see that? She just
said, "Fuck you" to me!

1009
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:22,373
Let the record show
I am merely standing here.

1010
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,546
Fuck you,
too, you whore.

1011
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:26,274
I'm warning you,
Mrs. Hinkle.

1012
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:30,614
One more obscenity and I'm gonna
charge you with contempt of court.

1013
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,821
Mrs. Hinkle,
are you insane?

1014
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:36,858
No, I'm not,
you motherfucker!

1015
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:40,251
Mrs. Hinkle, I
find you guilty of contempt

1016
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:44,163
and I sentence you to a $1,000
fine and five days in jail!

1017
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:46,056
Cocksucker!
Lock her up!

1018
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:49,297
You lousy pig fucker! You bitch!

1019
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:51,099
You ugly whore! Let go!

1020
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:57,378
Come on, they're going quickly!

1021
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:58,743
"Serial Mom" t
- shirts. Get them here.

1022
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:00,975
$12, while they last, plus tax.

1023
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:02,710
MasterCard and Visa.
I'll take two.

1024
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:03,876
All right, ma'am.

1025
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,648
I wish they'd had something like
this at the Kennedy kid trial.

1026
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:10,624
Sign right here.
Signature and home phone.

1027
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,057
You've read about it in the paper!

1028
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:14,118
Serial Mom.
She's Beverly Sutphin

1029
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:15,527
and she's my mom!

1030
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:18,896
Listen, you tell Geraldo
to go to hell, okay?

1031
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:22,459
I don't care what Jeffrey
MacDonald's people got. He's old news.

1032
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:26,029
We fly first class or we don't
do the show. It's that simple.

1033
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:27,302
Are you
Chip Sutphin?

1034
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:28,809
Hold on a sec.

1035
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:32,972
Yeah, I am, but you're gonna
have to speak with my agent.

1036
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:36,347
Your mom killed my brother. Come on!

1037
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:38,443
Come on...

1038
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,681
God...
Jeez, man!

1039
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:44,391
It's cool. It's cool, all right?

1040
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:47,053
Your Carl's brother,
right?

1041
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:48,187
That's right.

1042
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:50,391
I'm sorry he's dead.

1043
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,668
But have you
signed off yet?

1044
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:55,134
You mean
for TV or print?

1045
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:59,329
TV, man. Suzanne Somers is
interested in playing my mom.

1046
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:00,773
Suzanne Somers?

1047
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:03,703
Who's gonna
play my brother?

1048
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:05,906
I wonder if Jason Priestley's available?

1049
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:10,447
Miss Hodges, could you describe the car?

1050
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:16,213
The one you saw run over
Mr. Stubbins in cold blood.

1051
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:18,725
I seen that movie.
It was on cable.

1052
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:23,797
Miss Hodges...
Please, Miss Hodges.

1053
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:26,891
Could you...
Could you describe...

1054
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:30,094
Miss Hodges.

1055
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:31,469
Excuse me.

1056
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:35,671
Look, man, like I told you, it was blue.

1057
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:39,881
The car,
not the driver.

1058
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:45,480
Look, it was just blue.

1059
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:51,488
You know,
like, blue.

1060
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:01,531
There you go.
Enjoy my book.

1061
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:03,837
Could you sign it
"To A Future Serial Mom"?

1062
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:06,267
Sure. You think she did it?

1063
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:07,706
I have
reasonable doubt.

1064
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:11,177
I feel like killing a
couple people myself.

1065
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:12,474
$8, ma'am.

1066
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:15,744
And these books,
these disgusting books

1067
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:20,049
that so lovingly describe the
sadistic acts of serial killers,

1068
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:22,522
where did you find
these books, Detective?

1069
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,559
In Beverly Sutphin's
trashcan.

1070
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:28,291
You may cross-examine, Mrs. Sutphin.

1071
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:29,796
Thank you.

1072
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:39,237
Detective Gracey, if I were
to look through your trash,

1073
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:41,002
what reading materials
would I find?

1074
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:43,135
Objection! Immaterial!

1075
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:44,576
You may answer.

1076
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:50,446
<i>Time, Sports Illustrated,
National Geographic.</i>

1077
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:52,111
<i>My wife gets
Ladies' Home Journal.</i>

1078
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:56,785
Yet, last night, we found in
your trashcan this magazine,

1079
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:58,723
<i>Chicks with Dicks.</i>

1080
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:09,899
God damn you.
That's trespassing!

1081
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:14,772
Never judge a person by
what they read, Detective.

1082
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:16,902
Your witness,
Mr. Nazlerod.

1083
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:21,446
I am a married man. I hope
they give you the gas chamber!

1084
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:30,515
The jury is instructed to ignore
the outburst of the witness.

1085
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:33,894
I call to the stand Rosemary Ackerman.

1086
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:37,060
Now, did you ever see
the fire poker again

1087
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:38,258
after you left it

1088
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,028
with Mrs. Sutphin?

1089
01:20:40,101 --> 01:20:45,004
Yes, thirty minutes later. It
was covered with blood and gore

1090
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:47,940
and Carl Pageant
was dead.

1091
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,375
No further questions.

1092
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:55,409
Mrs. Ackerman, when you
left me at the Antique Mart,

1093
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:56,745
where did you go?

1094
01:20:58,153 --> 01:20:59,279
Browsing.

1095
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:02,482
Did Carl Pageant buy
something you wanted?

1096
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:06,152
I didn't want that Fabergé
egg. It was chipped.

1097
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:09,095
Carl Pageant died
because of you, didn't he?

1098
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:11,724
No. I would never
hurt anybody.

1099
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,236
<i>It was your Premiere magazine with
the letters cut out, wasn't it?</i>

1100
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:17,032
Yes, but I lent it...

1101
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:18,538
And they were your
scissors that were found

1102
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:21,440
in Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?

1103
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:23,170
Yes. But I didn't...

1104
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:24,837
Mrs. Ackerman...

1105
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:30,908
Do you recycle?

1106
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,050
No.

1107
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:47,165
I don't have room in my kitchen.

1108
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:55,540
Detective Pike, did you then
proceed to the stage area

1109
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:56,634
inside Hammerjacks?

1110
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:58,508
Yes, I did. Scotty Barnhill was on fire

1111
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,445
and he fell to his knees in flames.

1112
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:01,777
Would this be
what you saw?

1113
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:05,115
Yes, sir.
A real barbecue.

1114
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:08,051
May I show this photo
to the jury, Your Honor?

1115
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:09,317
Chip, she's here.

1116
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:12,588
They're entitled to see
Mrs. Sutphin's handiwork.

1117
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:27,866
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1118
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:30,470
Your Honor,

1119
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:32,035
may the photograph
please be received

1120
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:34,240
into evidence and shown to the jury?

1121
01:22:34,316 --> 01:22:36,181
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes.

1122
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:41,847
Jeez, that really is
Suzanne Somers.

1123
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:47,391
<i>Oh, I loved you
in Three's Company.</i>

1124
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,661
No further questions.

1125
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:54,258
I call to the stand
Marvin Pickles.

1126
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:04,307
Mr. Pickles!
Mr. Marvin Pickles!

1127
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:07,103
Be right out.

1128
01:23:07,182 --> 01:23:08,877
The judge is waiting for you.

1129
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,042
Okay.

1130
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:14,117
Come on,
get moving.

1131
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:20,422
State your name, please.

1132
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:21,928
Marvin A. Pickles.

1133
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:23,794
Mr. Pickles, were you in the men's room

1134
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:25,560
at the Antique Trade Mart

1135
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:27,362
on Saturday, May 15?

1136
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:30,770
Yes, I was.

1137
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:39,577
Oh, hi. What was the
rating? Well, what was the share?

1138
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:42,445
Did you see anyone in
the booth next to you?

1139
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:49,715
Excuse me, I...

1140
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:52,954
Mr. Pickles, did you see
anyone in the booth next to you?

1141
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:57,226
I'm not sure... I...

1142
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:58,822
What do you mean
you're not sure?

1143
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:01,768
There was nobody next to me.

1144
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:04,304
Mr. Pickles, didn't
you tell the Grand Jury

1145
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,033
that you looked down and you saw

1146
01:24:06,107 --> 01:24:10,669
a pair of ladies' shoes
in the booth next to you?

1147
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:12,372
I just said what you told me to.

1148
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:17,349
Perjury is a serious
offense, Mr. Pickles.

1149
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:25,793
I... I made it all up! I've never
seen Beverly Sutphin in my life!

1150
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:29,657
You'll pay for this,
Marvin Pickles.

1151
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:35,899
I'm turning your file
over to the vice squad.

1152
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:43,271
The prosecution rests.

1153
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:52,280
The prosecution has
proven nothing, Your Honor.

1154
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:54,150
The defense
rests also!

1155
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:03,259
Order.
Order in the courtroom.

1156
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,632
We'll take
a 10-minute recess.

1157
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:10,296
Attorneys, be ready with
your closing arguments.

1158
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:13,838
Well, I feel that
Beverly Sutphin

1159
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:16,308
is an innocent woman,
wrongly accused.

1160
01:25:16,644 --> 01:25:21,411
A normal housewife trapped in a
nightmare of circumstantial evidence.

1161
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:30,687
There she is, Henrietta
Lee Lucas, Joan Wayne Gacy.

1162
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:35,718
A new face in the deck of
serial killer trading cards.

1163
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:44,329
Find her guilty on all six
counts of first-degree murder.

1164
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:48,865
I only hope I can portray Serial
Mom's life on the TV screen

1165
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:54,381
with the proper dignity that
this feminist heroine deserves.

1166
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:59,977
Look at me. I am as
normal as all of you.

1167
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:05,751
But I have been
framed by the police

1168
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:12,499
and perjured against by the very
people I thought were my friends.

1169
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:14,925
All I ask of you...
Stop that!

1170
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:20,735
...is that you have the
courage to find me innocent

1171
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:24,209
of these terribly
untrue charges.

1172
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,976
All I ask is that you find me

1173
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:31,712
innocent of these
terribly untrue charges.

1174
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:54,003
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, have you reached a verdict?

1175
01:26:54,075 --> 01:26:55,975
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

1176
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:03,915
We find the defendant
not guilty of all charges.

1177
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:11,653
Way to go, Beverly!

1178
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:17,125
Oh! I'm coming home!

1179
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:24,933
What should I do?

1180
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:27,167
I don't know. Bring her home, I guess.

1181
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,767
No more violence.
No more violence.

1182
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:31,334
You think
she'll like me?

1183
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:37,313
Just be nice to her and try...
Try not to get on her nerves.

1184
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:42,848
She got off.

1185
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,016
She's innocent!

1186
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,423
Congratulations, Beverly.
Will you be staying...

1187
01:27:45,493 --> 01:27:47,427
Hello, Baltimore!
I love you.

1188
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:49,122
Oh, I love you, too.

1189
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:52,825
Thank you all for coming. Hi,
there, LA. Hello, Cleveland.

1190
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:53,924
Hey, Serial Mom!

1191
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,162
Well, hello, New York!

1192
01:27:55,236 --> 01:27:57,397
Beverly, who does your hair?

1193
01:27:59,474 --> 01:28:00,463
Excuse me!

1194
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:02,041
Would you hold these for me, honey?

1195
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:03,168
Excuse me.

1196
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:05,769
Excuse me, Mr. Sutphin, can
I ask you a question, please?

1197
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:08,042
Did the system work?
Do you think it worked?

1198
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:10,243
Excuse me. The rights have been sold.

1199
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:12,252
We did it.
We set her free!

1200
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,584
I knew she was innocent
right from the beginning.

1201
01:28:21,229 --> 01:28:23,959
You can't wear white
shoes after Labor Day.

1202
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:25,556
That's not
true anymore.

1203
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:29,160
Yes, it is. Didn't your
mother ever tell you?

1204
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,538
Now you know.

1205
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:38,172
No, please.
Fashion has changed.

1206
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:39,770
No, it hasn't.

1207
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:42,605
Are you
surprised, Mr. Sutphin?

1208
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:44,879
No comment.
Beverly?

1209
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:46,878
Here I am, honey.

1210
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:48,819
Beverly, hi!
I'm Suzanne Somers.

1211
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:49,982
Hello!

1212
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:52,993
Mrs. Sutphin, can we get a
shot of you and Suzanne Somers?

1213
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:54,756
Absolutely, stand here, Beverly.

1214
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:56,353
Guys, what about a nice two-shot, okay?

1215
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:57,523
No, Suzanne,
really, I'd be much...

1216
01:28:57,598 --> 01:28:59,259
Beverly, Beverly,
stand right here!

1217
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,302
Okay, smile,
Serial Mom!

1218
01:29:01,402 --> 01:29:04,337
Suzanne Somers,
this is my bad side!
