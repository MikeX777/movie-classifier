00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:31,422
Hi.

2
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:34,121
I'm Morgan Freeman.

3
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:36,688
You know, Paul robeson,
the great singer and activist,

4
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:41,345
used to sing a song called
"scandalize my name."

5
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:46,307
Ironically, because of the red
scare during the cold war,

6
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:50,137
that song came
to define his life,

7
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:53,140
because his name along with
that of many other performers,

8
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,796
was scandalized by what came
to be known as mccarthyism.

9
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:00,582
Now, black performers were
particularly vulnerable

10
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:05,152
because we had just begun
to be taken seriously.

11
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:09,417
And any outspokenness
against racism

12
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:13,334
was seen as the work
of communist agitators.

13
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:15,510
Many of the performers
you will see in this film

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,729
you may not recognize.

15
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:22,169
Goes to show how blacklisting
could make people disappear.

16
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:27,391
A group of former FBI agents,
with hoover's support,

17
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:31,526
put together this book
"red channels,"

18
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:33,093
which claims to be a list

19
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:37,271
of all the members of the
broadcast entertainment industry

20
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:39,795
who had communist affiliations.

21
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:41,623
"Red channels"
became so successful

22
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,973
that other groups
formed their own lists,

23
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,454
so the blacklist grew.

24
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:48,499
And the only way you could tell
you were on this list

25
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,156
is if you didn't get any work
and people shunned you.

26
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:57,943
And perhaps worst of all
was the slander of your name

27
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,513
and of the causes
you believed in.

28
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:08,824
Reading this book today is like
an honor roll of entertainers,

29
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:10,608
people in the industry,

30
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,396
who had the courage
and enough care

31
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:21,228
to lend their name
and talents to help others.

32
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:24,970
When the film begins, of course,
we're in a happier time.

33
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:27,321
Late '30s and early '40s,

34
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:30,019
people were trucking up
to Harlem

35
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,152
looking for a bright future.

36
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:33,501
If you were an actor
you might try

37
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:36,112
to get into dick Campbell's
Rose mclendon players

38
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,247
or Frederick O'Neal's
American negro theater.

39
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:41,770
Though ten years later,

40
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:44,033
both O'Neal and Campbell
were blacklisted for demanding

41
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,906
better representation
for blacks on television.

42
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:52,172
But when our story begins,
Harlem was the place to be.

43
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:56,524
I can remember the time when,

44
00:02:56,611 --> 00:03:00,702
from 110th street
to 155th street,

45
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:03,444
on 7th Avenue,

46
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:06,577
it was called Harlem's Broadway

47
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:10,712
and white people on Sunday
morning would come up there,

48
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:12,583
and drive very slowly

49
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:16,108
because that was the day
when all of the colored people,

50
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,590
all of US,
were dressed to the nines.

51
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:23,028
I mean to the nines,
with the gloves, with the veil,

52
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:26,380
with the earrings,
with your best Sunday dress

53
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:28,773
and people who lived
on that Avenue

54
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:32,342
would look out and say
"here they come a'struttin."

55
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:35,389
There's something of
an institution in Harlem

56
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,611
in the days
when I came along, about 1928.

57
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:42,265
It's called the tree of hope.

58
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:44,267
There was actually a tree

59
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:50,012
on the corner of 131st street
and 7th Avenue in Harlem.

60
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:53,668
Those were the days when
you walked by the Lafayette,

61
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:55,452
where all the beautiful,

62
00:03:55,583 --> 00:04:00,065
wonderful talented artists
would be standing between shows,

63
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:02,024
underneath the tree of hope.

64
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:03,504
And it was once said that

65
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:05,506
they could cast any black show
they wanted to cast

66
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:09,249
by coming up to 131st street
and 7th Avenue in Harlem

67
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,599
and they'd find all the black
actors that they wanted,

68
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,818
right there under
the tree of hope.

69
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,081
So that's where we stood,
under the tree of hope,

70
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:19,302
hoping that some white producer
would come uptown

71
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,609
and would hire some of US
to go downtown.

72
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:25,439
Ms. Lenoire:
If you were out of work all you
did was walk across the street,

73
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,049
right in the middle
of the street,

74
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:28,964
put your hand there
and make your wish

75
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:32,881
and sure enough you'd get a job
the next week or something.

76
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:38,756
In 1936 I came to New York

77
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:41,846
and there my first work
was with dick Campbell

78
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:46,242
and his particular group there,
the Rose mclendon players.

79
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:53,380
On the 23rd of April in 1939
I arrived in New York.

80
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,731
On that Monday I went and found
the Rose mclendon players,

81
00:04:56,861 --> 00:05:00,865
dick Campbell was on stage
nailing something

82
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:02,737
and I asked him if I could join.

83
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:06,044
I was nailing scenery and
standing up, my back was to him.

84
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:08,612
He came in and he said
"mister Campbell?"

85
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:10,005
I said "yes."

86
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:13,704
He said "may I join
your theater group?"

87
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:16,838
I said "well, with a voice
like that I would say yes."

88
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:19,362
And I turned around
and looked to see who it was,

89
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:21,930
and here was this long, tall,
skinny looking fellow,

90
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,758
he looked very hungry.

91
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:27,501
I said "you want to be
in the theater?"

92
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:30,068
He said "yes, sir."

93
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,157
When I came out of the Navy

94
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:34,203
I became a building
superintendent,

95
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,032
assistant to a building
superintendent.

96
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:41,384
And while doing the repairs
in an apartment

97
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:44,344
for one of the tenants,

98
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:49,958
I had been given two tickets
as a gratuity to attend

99
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:54,223
a performance at a place called
the American negro theater.

100
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,443
I learned about
the American negro theater

101
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,707
from an elevator operator

102
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:02,623
in the building
that I was living in.

103
00:06:02,753 --> 00:06:04,886
He said "why don't you go over
there and try to find out

104
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:07,410
if there isn't something you can
do because in those shows

105
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,544
you don't have to sing and dance
like in these other shows.

106
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:12,981
You don't have to act
dumb and stupid,

107
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:14,635
carrying a tray and whatnot."

108
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:16,550
I didn't care what I had to do.

109
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,074
I just wanted to be
in the environment.

110
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:20,467
I found it very stimulating.

111
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:23,252
I found that
there was an intellect,

112
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:34,089
that there was a scholarship,
there was purpose.

113
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:37,658
And I was looking for purpose
and I thought this would be

114
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:39,616
a very good place
in which to start.

115
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:51,889
♪ This little light of mine,
I'm gonna let it shine. ♪

116
00:06:52,063 --> 00:07:01,029

123
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:21,022
I came out of the service
with great expectations.

124
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:24,939
That we had just
defeated fascism,

125
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,898
we had just defeated
totalitarianism,

126
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:33,774
we had just defeated philosophy
of white supremacy.

127
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:39,519
The world was in a mood
of great rejoicing.

128
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,912
One of the things
that impressed me most

129
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:44,785
about the New York
theatrical scene

130
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:46,526
when I came back from the war,

131
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:50,878
was an awareness
on everybody's part that the war

132
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:57,101
had been a serious challenge
on the subject of race.

133
00:08:57,232 --> 00:09:04,021
We were all still shocked
at what had happened in Europe

134
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:10,941
to the millions of Jews
and others in those camps.

135
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:15,032
I'd expected that america
would be open and generous

136
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:21,909
and rewarding to
its black citizens

137
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:25,390
who had served in that war
and had served with great honor.

138
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:27,088
There seemed to be
a determination

139
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:31,179
immediately after the war
to say to ourselves

140
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,181
"that would never happen again"

141
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:37,402
that on the subject of race,
we were one, we were equal

142
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,622
and we were partners
and brothers.

143
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:41,755
When we came back there were
many forces in america,

144
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:43,365
very powerful,

145
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:46,324
that decided that those of US
who had been brainwashed

146
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:48,239
with these new ideas
from the war,

147
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,632
that thought we could come back

148
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,808
and change the way america
was doing business

149
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:57,161
was in for a very cruel
and a huge surprise.

150
00:09:57,292 --> 00:10:04,995
We were going to go back
to conditions as was before.

151
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:08,520
We were to be a bunch of niggers
who were to come back

152
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:12,220
and get those thoughts of
freedom out of our heads.

153
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,572
We were seriously concerned that
america be a different place,

154
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,705
as far as race was concerned.

155
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:22,622
And that gave US a common
objective that was bigger,

156
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:24,841
even than the parts
we were playing.

157
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:29,411
Broadway had a kind of social
as well as a cultural function,

158
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,587
which we took quite seriously.

159
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:34,111
At the end of
a performance every night,

160
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:37,114
somebody would say "hey let's
go over to so and so's,

161
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:40,683
they're raising funds
to defend Willy McGee"

162
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:43,425
or somebody had been lynched
in the south

163
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:45,340
or some atrocity had happened.

164
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,693
We made it our business to
become part of any force

165
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:55,045
that was speaking out
against this inhumane cruelty.

166
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:57,613
Mr. Davis: And we were
determined to force the issue

167
00:10:57,744 --> 00:11:01,051
of justice for everybody
onto the public consciousness.

168
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:03,401
And the total theatrical
community, in my mind,

169
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:04,968
seemed to be caught up in that.

170
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,014
The producers were involved,
the directors, the actors,

171
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:08,537
the writers.

172
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,323
We belonged to a sort of
a blessed confraternity.

173
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:14,064
And we were glad to be comrades

174
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:18,765
and marching forward
in the same struggle.

175
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,767
We didn't know how thoroughly
we were being watched.

176
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:25,597
Certainly not in '46, '47, '48.

177
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:31,734
All of a sudden
there emerged this...

178
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:38,915
...this noise that erupted,

179
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:44,965
this group that started
the talk about any and all of US

180
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:49,752
who dared to embark on such
conduct were unpatriotic

181
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:53,887
and were working towards
the worst interests of our home,

182
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:57,934
our patriotism was to be
seriously challenged

183
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:03,331
and some of US listened
to these utterances

184
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:07,335
with complete disbelief.

185
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:11,731
As a matter of fact it was a
huge stretch of the imagination

186
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:13,341
to suggest that those of US

187
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:16,997
who had struggled against
racism and oppression, sexism,

188
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:21,697
and all the things we struggled
against were unpatriotic.

189
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:27,050
When in fact we knew
and felt righteously strong.

197
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:20,712
My experience with Paul robeson
was on more levels than one.

198
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,327
On the personal level,
he was an immediate mentor

199
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:30,548
and hero for those of US
in the theater,

200
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,682
who wanted to be actors.

201
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,772
We wanted to be,
to some degree, like he was.

202
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:39,949
He was huge, he was beautiful,
he could sing,

203
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,344
and he was an athlete,
and he was sexy.

204
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:47,478
He had all of the positive
things that a young man

205
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:50,830
and a young woman
could be inspired by.

206
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,006
Paul represented to US

207
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:57,314
that top moment,
the top possibility.

208
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:59,708
An artist in every sense
of the word

209
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,190
but his art was not only
an expression of his own talent

210
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,713
or his love for beauty,

211
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:10,980
it was his expression of
concern for the rest of US.

212
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:14,592
The artist was the nurturer,
the artist was the defender,

213
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,986
the artist was the spokesperson.

214
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:21,208
He helped me interpret song,
he inspired me,

215
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:24,167
he gave me a platform
in which to learn,

216
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:29,433
to understand much about human
conduct and human affairs.

217
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:38,921
His sensitivity, his honor,
his honesty, his compassion,

218
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:45,058
all played a huge role
in how I perceived

219
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:48,931
art and artists to be.

220
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:52,456
And how powerful we were
and what we could achieve.

221
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:57,984
He was one of the greatest
figures in American culture.

222
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:00,334
A singer, a giant of a man,

223
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:02,814
an all American football player,

224
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,295
phi beta kappa, law student,

225
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:09,604
actor, shakespearean,
and a leader of his people.

226
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:13,608
And so inspiring was he
and so powerful was he,

227
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:18,787
that at all costs,
he had to be silenced.

228
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,791
And as a matter of fact
on the agenda to silence him

229
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,229
was the understanding
that if we can silence him,

230
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,190
all others will come
far more easily.

231
00:15:30,277 --> 00:15:32,279
Paul was a threat because he

232
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:37,458
was a tremendously intelligent
and well learned man.

233
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:41,244
Paul also had charisma
in the same sense

234
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,985
that Martin Luther King
had charisma,

235
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:45,640
in other words Paul
was the kind of man

236
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:47,947
that could lead
masses of people.

237
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:50,253
And those who understand
those things

238
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,125
knew that Paul robeson
was a man

239
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:55,780
who could affect
large majorities.

240
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:59,262
Now all this took place
in an atmosphere super heated

241
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:04,311
by the relationships between
Russia and america at the time.

242
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:06,356
Newsreel announcer:
The growing menace
of communism arouses

243
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:07,836
the house of representatives'

244
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,838
unamerican activities
committee.

245
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,883
Among the well informed
witnesses testifying

246
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,537
is j. Edgar hoover,

247
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:16,018
head of the federal bureau
of investigation.

248
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:18,803
Mr. Hoover speaks with
authority on the subject.

249
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,980
The communist party
of the United States

250
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,200
is a fifth column
if there ever was one.

251
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:26,289
It is far better
organized than were

252
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:30,859
the Nazis in occupied countries
prior to their capitulation.

253
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:33,035
They are seeking
to weaken america,

254
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,430
just as they did
in their era of obstruction,

255
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,345
when they were aligned
with the Nazis.

256
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:42,218
Their goal is the overthrow
of our government.

257
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:47,049
There is no doubt as to where a
real communist's loyalty rests.

258
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,226
Their allegiance is to Russia,
not the United States.

259
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:52,620
The reason that robeson
was a very strong supporter

260
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,839
of the Soviet union was,

261
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:59,322
it was his belief that they
had no discrimination policies

262
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:02,195
against blacks there
or against anybody else.

263
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:05,111
Well, he was treated like
a prince whenever he came there.

264
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,377
[Russian announcer
introducing Paul robeson]

265
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:12,901
He didn't really know
what was going on

266
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,511
in the rest of the country.

267
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:16,557
So his identification with
the Soviet union,

268
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,950
whether he was
an actual communist or not

269
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:24,086
was unimportant, he was theirs
and he supported them,

270
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:28,873
in policies,
both political and cultural,

271
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,137
and made a big speech
at one point

272
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:33,269
that no black man
and no black person in america

273
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:35,228
would ever go to war
against the Soviet union,

274
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:37,447
which sounded like
he was calling for treason

275
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:40,668
among the black population
in the United States.

276
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:42,365
Mr. Davis: The statement he made

277
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,585
about blacks not fighting
against their own interests

278
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:47,979
was interpreted by a lot to
mean that he was saying to US

279
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,807
"you blacks can't fight,

280
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:52,636
you shouldn't fight
the Russians, no matter what."

281
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:55,639
Then the powers that be,
meaning j. Edgar hoover,

282
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,903
had to cut down Paul's influence

283
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,732
and they set out
to demolish the man

284
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:04,518
and they took some heavy bites
out of him.

285
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:10,785
Newsreel announcer:
Baseball's top hitter

286
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:12,656
and star second baseman
of the Brooklyn Dodgers,

287
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:15,572
Jackie Robinson,
comes to bat for uncle Sam

288
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:17,270
to refute Paul robeson's remark

289
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,925
that u.S. Negroes would not
fight in a war against Russia.

290
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:23,145
I'm on my way to Washington
to testify

291
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:26,322
before the house unamerican
activities committee.

292
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:27,889
That's all I can say
at this time,

293
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:29,673
I'll make further statements
in Washington.

294
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:31,762
Robinson is the last witness
to testify

295
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:34,461
concerning the loyalty of
the members of his race and

296
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:37,855
before the committee he reads
his own prepared statement.

297
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:39,205
I've been asked to express

298
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,729
my views on Paul robeson's
statements in Paris,

299
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:45,211
to the effect that American
negroes would refuse to fight

300
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:49,606
in any war against Russia
because we love Russia so much.

301
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:53,567
I haven't any comment to make
on that statement,

302
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:57,048
except that if mister robeson
actually made it,

303
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:01,401
it sounds very silly to me,
and most negroes and Italians,

304
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:05,666
and Irish, and Jews, and Swedes,
and slavs and other Americans

305
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:08,669
would act just as all these
groups did in the last war.

306
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,715
They'd do their best to keep
their country out of war.

307
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,936
If unsuccessful, they'd do
their best to help their country

308
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:16,851
win the war against Russia,

309
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:19,506
or any other enemy
that threatened US.

310
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:31,648
Jackie came into the big leagues
in 1947

311
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:36,871
and we appreciated,
we loved, and we honored

312
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,308
and were honored by him
and his behavior,

313
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:43,617
both on the baseball field
and off.

314
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:46,924
We recognize the tremendous
pressure that was on him.

315
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:50,363
We recognize that he was
required not to hit back.

316
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:54,845
We recognize that he had been,
to some degree,

317
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:57,283
willing to give up his own life

318
00:19:57,413 --> 00:20:00,590
so that baseball and
the people who controlled it

319
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:04,203
could make a statement
that would open up the doors.

320
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,683
So I assume the pressure
was put on Jackie

321
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:11,253
and there he was
in that symbolic position

322
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:13,647
and I remember years later,

323
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:17,955
Jackie himself still carrying
the scar and pain

324
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:20,131
of having to do that.

325
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:23,831
And it broke his heart
and it broke our hearts, too.

326
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:26,007
So the blacks here said

327
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:27,356
"hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute,"

328
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:29,576
you know,
the organization people,

329
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:31,491
"we don't want to get
too close to Paul.

330
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:35,408
We love him like a brother
but he can be poison to US,

331
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:37,018
we have more important
things to do,

332
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:40,456
we're trying to fight to get our
rights to go into restaurants,

333
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:44,852
to go into housing,
to get jobs on an equal basis,

334
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:47,898
and Paul robeson is just
muddying the waters

335
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:50,640
with the talk about
the Soviet union."

336
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:55,732
And so he was alienated
and isolated from all sides.

337
00:20:55,863 --> 00:21:00,650
If you're looking
to create disunity,

338
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:05,089
if you're looking to destroy
something that is strong,

339
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:08,310
and good, and real and needed,

340
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:11,008
you must go after
the most powerful voice

341
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:14,621
that articulates that agenda.

342
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:17,363
No voice was greater
than Paul robeson's

343
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:21,845
in talking about democracy
and the rights of human beings.

344
00:21:21,976 --> 00:21:24,718
There is one of
the greatest cultural figures

345
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:26,415
in American history,

346
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:30,376
and he was banned in effect
from making a living.

347
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:31,812
Nobody wanted to touch him,

348
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:33,857
couldn't get a passport
to go to Europe,

349
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:37,731
his concerts here
were kind of damaged.

361
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:19,729
In American politics
there's always been a large use

362
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:27,302
of labels or scare words,
behind which were issues

363
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:30,044
which were not brought out
into the open.

364
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:33,787
Now during the first world war
it was anarchists.

365
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:35,745
By the time of
the second world war,

366
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:38,879
anarchists no longer seemed
very interesting,

367
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:41,011
but it was more interesting
to call people communists

368
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:43,797
because of the rise
of the Soviet union.

369
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:47,583
If you remember, for the longest
time the majority of power

370
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:51,674
in congress, the decisive power,

371
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:53,937
was wielded by,
not the dixiecrats,

372
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:57,376
but the southern component.

373
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:59,769
Their power rested
entirely on the fact

374
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,555
that they represented districts
where blacks could not vote

375
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:05,993
in which blacks
were in a majority.

376
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:08,691
So if the blacks won the vote,

377
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:11,346
their power would end
immediately.

378
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:14,088
And they were the ones who were
most ardent in their pursuit

379
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:15,872
of the red devils,
and they were the ones

380
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:18,484
who were most ardent
in keeping the blacks down.

381
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:21,661
We know that to j. Edgar hoover,

382
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:25,055
an interest in improving
the status of the negro

383
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:28,537
was a communist symptom.

384
00:23:28,668 --> 00:23:31,932
Just as the idea of being
interested in better relations

385
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:34,674
with the Soviet union
was a communist symptom.

386
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:36,502
Announcer:
In recognizing a communist,

387
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:39,243
physical appearance
counts for nothing.

388
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,159
If a person consistently
reads and advocates the views

389
00:23:42,246 --> 00:23:45,467
expressed in
a communist publication,

390
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:47,730
he may be a communist.

391
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:52,387
Before McCarthy came along,
the industry,

392
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:55,521
both Hollywood
and broadcasting,

393
00:23:55,651 --> 00:24:01,004
had already established what
McCarthy was accused of doing,

394
00:24:01,135 --> 00:24:05,052
of sort of terrorizing
the people who worked in it.

395
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:08,185
I can remember very well
when I first saw "red channels"

396
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:11,101
because it was my 42nd birthday
and I happened to wander

397
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:16,150
into a bookstore
and there was this thing,

398
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,720
"red channels" with a microphone
and a red hand over it,

399
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:24,724
and I picked it up to look
at it, it was one dollar,

400
00:24:24,811 --> 00:24:28,249
and I suddenly saw
what it was purported to be,

401
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:30,207
a documentation of a conspiracy

402
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:35,212
to take over the broadcast media
for the Soviet cause.

403
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:39,521
That's what it said it was, and
this was a list of 151 people

404
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:43,264
that showed who
the conspirators were.

405
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:45,614
The point of this book was
everything you wanted to know

406
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:48,312
about every writer or performer

407
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:51,577
and most of these people
were well known performers

408
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,840
who had appeared at functions
during the war

409
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:56,930
that had been supported
by the war departments

410
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,586
and Mrs. Roosevelt,
who herself was suspect.

411
00:25:00,673 --> 00:25:04,415
What they are being
condemned for was all the things

412
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:07,984
that had been liberal impulses
over the last 20 years.

413
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:12,032
More rights for the negro,
civil liberties,

414
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:16,036
better relations with
the Soviet union, peace.

415
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,255
"Red channels" was
the beginning of it,

416
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:20,301
but this was such
a nice business

417
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:23,870
that other agencies grew up
and did the same sort of thing.

418
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:25,828
There was an organization
called "aware,"

419
00:25:25,915 --> 00:25:28,614
which very aggressively began
to list other people

420
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:30,398
who were not in "red channels."

421
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:34,141
There was a publication
called "counter attack."

422
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:36,360
There was one called "aware,"

423
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:38,232
and then there was
the Attorney General

424
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:41,322
of the United States of America,
who had his own list.

425
00:25:41,452 --> 00:25:43,324
The state department had a list.

426
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:46,414
J. Edgar hoover and the FBI
had a list.

427
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:48,895
The ku klux klan had a list,

428
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:51,724
all the white citizen's groups
had a list.

429
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:54,074
Some unions had a list.

430
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:57,556
You had these clearance bodies
set up by some group

431
00:25:57,686 --> 00:26:00,776
that decided,
since they had the expertise,

432
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:04,432
they could read newspapers
and clip the daily worker

433
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:09,785
and find out who appeared
at a certain kind of function

434
00:26:09,872 --> 00:26:13,702
as a singer, as a writer,
as a performer.

435
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,748
Before you knew it,
some of the best people

436
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:17,967
in the business
were being blacklisted.

437
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:33,417
♪

438
00:26:35,158 --> 00:26:39,119
Throughout the 1940s,
something which could be used

439
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:42,992
against my mother
and many others

440
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:49,129
was the assertion that
the causes that they embraced

441
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:52,698
were also causes that
the communist party embraced.

442
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:55,352
When my mother was confronted
with this, she said

443
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:59,748
"I'm not going to relax
my efforts to get equal rights

444
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:02,359
for people of color
merely because

445
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:05,536
the communist party
also embraces that effort."

446
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:11,934
And she rejected as totally
false any attempt to claim

447
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:14,850
that she was a communist
or communist sympathizer

448
00:27:14,937 --> 00:27:17,766
because of her work
for civil rights.

449
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:20,726
One of the criticisms of her

450
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:24,730
was that she had entertained
Soviet troops.

451
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,647
"There you are, entertaining
troops of our enemy."

452
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:30,474
I remember a reporter
asking her about this.

453
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:32,172
"Miss Scott,

454
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:34,478
how could you have entertained
these troops of our enemies?"

455
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:36,306
And she said
"well, look at the date.

456
00:27:36,437 --> 00:27:40,746
It was 1943 and if you recall
we were their allies then."

457
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:43,400
She did a great deal
of entertaining of troops and

458
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:46,752
quite often you had joint forces
toward the end of the war,

459
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:50,103
so she thought it was
no small irony

460
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:53,933
that she was accused of being
unpatriotic for something which

461
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:56,762
five years earlier had been
the height of patriotism.

462
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:58,285
And at the same time,

463
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:02,376
she was married to a very
controversial member of congress

464
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,857
who himself was the object
of attacks

465
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:08,164
by some of his colleagues
and others.

466
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:14,518
She was convinced that
his enemies also had used her

467
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:16,869
as a way to reach him and that
she was particularly vulnerable

468
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:20,786
because of the fact
that her livelihood

469
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,657
depended on acceptance,

470
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:25,791
not only by the public,
who are buying the tickets

471
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:28,315
and turning on her radio show
and television show,

472
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:32,623
but also by the networks
and the advertisers.

473
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,366
An atmosphere of mystery
hung over the whole business

474
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:38,978
of "red channels."

475
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:42,285
The copies disappeared
into the desks of executives

476
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:44,505
and they began to use them

477
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:47,029
to decide whether
or not to hire an actor.

478
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,816
One of the themes
of my mother's appearance

479
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:53,557
before the unamerican
activities committee

480
00:28:53,688 --> 00:28:56,909
was her repeated denials
of the truth

481
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,475
of what had been published.

482
00:28:58,606 --> 00:29:00,042
She said "this is not true"

483
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:04,612
and it was improper
for a publisher

484
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,832
to in effect try to
end someone's career

485
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:09,225
by publishing inaccurate
information.

486
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:11,445
My mother kept pointing out
that at no time had anyone

487
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:13,839
made a single
telephone call to her,

488
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:15,449
sent a telegram to her,

489
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:19,845
sent a letter to her asking
"is any of this true?"

490
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:22,195
The agency tried very hard

491
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:25,459
not to put anything in writing
about this whole system.

492
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:29,071
They even corrupted the language
to take care of it.

493
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:31,552
They didn't say
"he's not acceptable"

494
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:33,772
they said "he's not available."

495
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:35,121
In fact, her appearance
before the committee

496
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:37,601
was at her request.

497
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:40,648
She hadn't been subpoenaed,

498
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,650
many people advised her
not to do it.

499
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,653
She said this is a matter
where not only my career,

500
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:52,442
but my name have been taken
and used improperly.

501
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:59,145
Here you had someone who had had
her own network radio program

502
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:01,060
from the early '40s, on.

503
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,627
You had someone who was,
I believe,

504
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:06,152
the first black headliner

505
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:10,547
of a weekly network
television program,

506
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:16,423
who appeared in movies regularly
and all that stopped,

507
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:18,860
and it all stopped just after
the time of her appearance

508
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:21,210
before the committee.

509
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,345
It's important to remember
that this whole dreadful period

510
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:28,609
happened at the very birth
of television.

511
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:33,048
Television in its first years
lived in this atmosphere

512
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:38,097
of backbiting and
defamation and fear,

513
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:40,969
which I'm sure had an enormous
effect on its future.

514
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:47,106
When I first discovered
the blacklist,

515
00:30:47,193 --> 00:30:49,804
I had gone to see my agent

516
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:56,289
and it was about getting
a job in television.

517
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:58,465
And he was an agent

518
00:30:58,595 --> 00:31:01,163
in one of the most powerful
agencies in america

519
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:02,817
and I was just at the threshold

520
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:06,777
of the launching
of my own career.

521
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:13,741
And he pulled out a drawer in
his desk, reached for a phone,

522
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,223
it was not part
of the regular phone bank,

523
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:22,924
he dialed a number and all
he did was to give my name,

524
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:27,624
Harry Belafonte, and then
he waited for instruction

525
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:31,324
and then he hung up the phone,
closed the drawer,

526
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:36,416
and said "you're on the list,
you're unemployable."

527
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:39,941
We figured we would go crazy
if we tried to figure out

528
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:42,813
whether we were blacklisted
because we were black

529
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:44,380
or blacklisted
because we were red.

530
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:48,776
Evening old scores
is what this was all about.

531
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:54,129
Tradition was that, whoever won
the Tony award in the theater,

532
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:57,872
was on the following Sunday
after the awards were given

533
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:02,007
to appear on the most popular
television show in america,

534
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:04,574
the ed Sullivan show.

535
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:07,490
Ed Sullivan was rooted
in American journalism,

536
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:09,797
he was a most powerful reporter.

537
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:14,584
He and Walter winchell
and a host of journalists

538
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:19,198
used their tabloids to become
supporters of the black list.

539
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:22,462
And when my name came up
as the winner of the Tony award,

540
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:26,857
he was told
that I was unacceptable

541
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:31,601
and he then called me to come
and have an interview with him,

542
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:33,125
and I went.

543
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:34,778
And he said "you know,
there is some resistance

544
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:37,042
to your coming
on the show because of..."

545
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:40,697
And he read a list of things
that I had been accused of

546
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:46,268
and I said to him that many of
the things on the list were true

547
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,620
and other things
on the list were false.

548
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:53,972
But I do not choose to identify
which is true and which is false

549
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:57,062
because that is not
really the issue.

550
00:32:57,192 --> 00:33:01,501
The issue is
my right to privacy,

551
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:05,461
my right to my beliefs
as an American citizen

552
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:08,116
and that I was sorry that
I did not have the opportunity

553
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:12,120
to appear on his show, I would
dearly have loved to do so,

554
00:33:12,251 --> 00:33:14,601
it would have meant a lot
to my career

555
00:33:14,688 --> 00:33:16,385
and I thanked him and I left.

556
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:19,519
That evening I got a call
from the very same agent

557
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:22,348
who had picked up the phone
in the other instance,

558
00:33:22,478 --> 00:33:27,962
to tell me that I was on
the ed Sullivan show.

559
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:31,183
And that I should be prepared to
go to rehearsals that Saturday

560
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:32,619
and that Sunday,

561
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:35,926
and that I'd be on the air live
that same weekend.

562
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:41,367
This fact and this act forever
took me off the blacklist.

563
00:33:41,497 --> 00:33:45,806
Just ed Sullivan's endorsement
alone gave me that relief.

564
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:47,938
But what it did do

565
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:51,507
was that it instantly raised
significant suspicion

566
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:55,772
among my colleagues
that I had betrayed them

567
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:57,470
because there was no way

568
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,863
for me to have gotten on
the ed Sullivan show

569
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:04,303
if I had not played
the betrayal game.

570
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:10,483
And it was a very, very,
very difficult time for me.

571
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:13,442
Down I went to CBS,
I'll never forget it,

572
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:18,795
and I stood in the doorway
where the typewriters were

573
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:20,710
and the producer was,

574
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:22,103
and he said
"yes, what are you doing?"

575
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:24,279
And he got up and he was in
his shirtsleeves

576
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:26,847
and he said, "we don't have any
maid's roles."

577
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:30,503
And I said "oh, I know, but I
thought maybe I would be allowed

578
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:32,766
to read for the receptionist"

579
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:37,162
and he drew himself up
with pure disgust, looked at me

580
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:40,600
and said "when the day comes

581
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:44,908
that we cast you people
in a receptionist role,

582
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,563
I will turn over in my grave."

583
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:53,656
The absence of black faces
on television's whole schedule

584
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:55,745
is racism much more

585
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:59,314
than any particular
racist remark might be.

586
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:03,492
So the most serious kind
of racism is invisible.

587
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:09,629
I must tell you
I was blacklisted.

588
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:17,550
I was a little bit tired
of seeing black actors in radio,

589
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,379
as well as television,
that had just come on the scene,

590
00:35:20,509 --> 00:35:23,904
doing the kind of roles that
they were doing at all times.

591
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:28,952
Now dick was one of those people
and still is,

592
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:31,868
who always is aware
of what is going on

593
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:33,435
and what ain't going on.

594
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:35,698
And always takes
not only a position

595
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:37,874
but something in the back of
his mind always pushes dick

596
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:39,746
to do something about it.

597
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:44,620
So I set up a campaign
in the negro press.

598
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:48,363
I wrote articles and I put out
release after release,

599
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:52,324
complaining and protesting
against the type of roles

600
00:35:52,454 --> 00:35:55,370
that black actors were
portraying in television

601
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:57,764
and on radio
and everywhere else.

602
00:35:57,894 --> 00:36:04,597
And dick, as a part of being
dick Campbell, on one occasion,

603
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:10,385
since there were no blacks
in television, called on Harlem

604
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:15,042
to turn off the television set
on Saturday night.

605
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,567
I said "don't turn on your TV,
leave it black

606
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:21,266
because that's the only way
you can make the producers

607
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:23,311
understand that you want

608
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:26,401
a different type of show
on television.

609
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:28,534
So don't turn it on."
They said "why not turn it on?"

610
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:32,538
Because if you don't turn on
your television

611
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:35,976
the commercial producers will
know that the products are not

612
00:36:36,106 --> 00:36:40,459
being sold to the audience
because ten percent

613
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:45,290
of the population of the united
states that owns television sets

614
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,728
are not watching,
so they will be losing money.

615
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:50,730
That's what it's all about.

616
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,994
So boycott on this
particular night.

617
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:56,257
And we set up the boycott
and it worked.

618
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:59,652
So then that's when
they called me downtown.

619
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:02,916
I was surprised that the powers
that be were so disturbed

620
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:06,702
but when they heard dick
calling for everybody,

621
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:08,530
they said
"oh no, we must do something."

622
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:12,491
And on the basis of that,
dick was sent for,

623
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:15,058
and he talked and he negotiated,

624
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:17,931
and he opened some doors
and got US some jobs.

625
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:21,064
Of course,
they never gave dick a job.

626
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:22,805
But here's what you have
to remember,

627
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:27,549
every role I played,
I was a maid,

628
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:31,031
I was either
the head housekeeper,

629
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:34,121
or I was the nursemaid
for the family,

630
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,994
or I was the janitor
or the day worker.

631
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,953
Those were the roles.

632
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:45,088
In my opinion, stereotypes
are not inherently offensive.

633
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:49,049
It is who uses the stereotype
and to what end.

634
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:53,401
In 1951 the naacp at
its convention condemned

635
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:56,012
"Amos and Andy,"

636
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:57,927
and in general people
were very surprised at that.

637
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:00,408
How can they condemn
"Amos and Andy?"

638
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:02,105
"Amos and Andy" had been,

639
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:05,283
for years, and years, and years,
the number one program.

640
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:09,330
Reportedly popular
in Harlem also.

641
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:12,159
So why were they suddenly
complaining about it?

642
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,511
So this opened a new discussion
about these symbols,

643
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:18,121
these stereotypes.

644
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:19,732
What in the world
am I going to do?

645
00:38:19,862 --> 00:38:21,995
This ain't no joke, son.

646
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:24,693
I know, I'll go see
my lawyer Calhoun.

647
00:38:24,824 --> 00:38:27,696
Kingfish, the thing
for you to do

648
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:30,960
is have your wife, sapphire,
go down to the draft board

649
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:33,006
and plead with them
not to take you.

650
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:34,312
Plead with them?

651
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:37,445
That's what I said,
plead with them.

652
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:41,536
Mister, you can't take
my husband to the army.

653
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:45,497
You can't do it, he's all
I've got in the world,

654
00:38:45,627 --> 00:38:49,109
all I've got between me
and starvation.

655
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:51,546
And what will become of
our three little children?

656
00:38:51,677 --> 00:38:54,201
Whose gonna take care
of little Dorothy,

657
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,770
and Peggy,
and little erma?

658
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,816
You can't take him,
not my man!"

659
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:05,255
Being a fool or being silly gave
the whites a chance to justify

660
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:08,302
a certain stereotype,
so we in the black community

661
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:11,479
had to hold our artists
to a higher standard

662
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:15,265
because they affected how we
were treated out in the world.

663
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:22,272
We had an organization that was
sort of fighting the practice

664
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:28,104
of the use that they were making
of negro actors at the time,

665
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:32,021
and this was the case
of "Amos and Andy."

666
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:37,070
We had particularly objected
to the way they described

667
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:42,292
the lawyer and we asked
that this be changed

668
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:44,643
and they made that change,

669
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:48,211
but he was just a petty
politician instead of a lawyer

670
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:51,693
because this gave
the wrong impression

671
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:58,744
of that particular profession
of legal representation.

672
00:39:58,874 --> 00:40:00,833
I know you compromise
on a number of things

673
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,575
but you just don't compromise
on certain principles.

674
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:07,579
And so I don't compromise
on principles.

675
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:09,276
Ms. Lenoire:
Now Frederick O'Neal,

676
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,497
oh my god,
he was something else

677
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:17,806
and has always been because
Fred sacrificed his own career.

678
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:28,817
♪ Dere's a man a going 'round
taking names, ♪

679
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:32,821
♪ dere's a man

680
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:36,738
I was in a doctors' office
when two white men came in,

681
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:40,089
I remember I was lying down
and I looked up in their faces

682
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:44,398
and they said "rosetta lenoire?"
And I said "yes."

683
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:48,968
"Do you live at
2340 7th Avenue?"

684
00:40:49,055 --> 00:40:52,450
I said "yes."

685
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,668
"Let me ask you something."

686
00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:54,974
And then one of them
sat down and said

687
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:56,671
"let me ask you something...

688
00:40:56,802 --> 00:41:03,373
Why is it that you attend
these red meetings?"

689
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,942
He said "well, you know that
you're on the blacklist,

690
00:41:07,029 --> 00:41:09,467
tell me about Frederick O'Neal,
tell me about Sidney poitier,

691
00:41:09,597 --> 00:41:12,208
tell me about Brock Peters
and whatnot."

692
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:14,950
And I said "the only thing
I can tell you about them

693
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:18,867
is that they're wonderful human
beings, they're gentle men,

694
00:41:18,998 --> 00:41:22,044
and they're darned good artists,
that's what I know about them."

695
00:41:22,175 --> 00:41:25,439
We did the Fred waring show

696
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:32,968
and I understand that CBS had
more correspondence on that show

697
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:35,797
than any other show
at that particular time.

698
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:40,498
[Applause]

699
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:42,978
World history week
inspires our production

700
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:47,330
of James weldon Johnson's great
poems from god's trombones.

701
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:52,597
After we did that, there was a
big rush to have it done again.

702
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:57,340
And so Fred got in touch
with me, Fred waring that is,

703
00:41:57,427 --> 00:41:59,038
and asked me to come back.

704
00:41:59,168 --> 00:42:00,779
When I got back,
I was surprised

705
00:42:00,866 --> 00:42:05,566
that Fred O'Neal was no longer
with the production,

706
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:07,699
and I asked around,

707
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:11,572
and there seemed to be
a "hush hush" about it,

708
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:15,010
and then I asked Fred waring

709
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:20,973
and he said that a young man
in the chorus,

710
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:23,497
he would like for him to do it,

711
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:29,068
he had won an audition and
he would like for him to do it.

712
00:42:29,155 --> 00:42:30,591
And I said

713
00:42:30,678 --> 00:42:34,595
"well, you know, I expected
to find Fred O'Neal here."

714
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:40,340
And so there were whispers,
something about

715
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:45,301
Fred not being...You know,
a pinko or something like that

716
00:42:45,432 --> 00:42:46,999
but when I would
walk in the room

717
00:42:47,129 --> 00:42:48,740
the conversation would stop.

718
00:42:48,827 --> 00:42:50,872
So I called Fred O'Neal, I said
"why aren't you doing it?"

719
00:42:51,003 --> 00:42:54,006
He said "well, I wasn't
asked to do it."

720
00:42:54,136 --> 00:42:56,225
I said "well, that's strange."

721
00:42:56,312 --> 00:42:58,793
And he said
"well, I think I know why."

722
00:42:58,924 --> 00:43:02,057
He gave as his excuse,
as far as I know,

723
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:06,279
that he had been accused
of not using blacks in his choir

724
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:11,458
and so forth and now that he had
this one black man in the choir

725
00:43:11,545 --> 00:43:16,071
and he thought he had
better use him instead.

726
00:43:16,202 --> 00:43:22,425
So I learned later that it was
mccarthyism that defeated me.

727
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:28,823
Everybody was so intimidated
by the power of

728
00:43:28,954 --> 00:43:30,433
the house unamerican
activities committee,

729
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,349
Joe McCarthy and
all of those who serviced

730
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:36,135
that evil instrument
and that evil moment

731
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:40,879
was so overwhelming that people
became petrified,

732
00:43:40,966 --> 00:43:44,360
they became calcified,
they became immobile,

733
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:47,668
they became impotent,
they became voiceless.

734
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:50,236
And in the midst of
that moment of weakness,

735
00:43:50,323 --> 00:43:53,761
many people went to prison,
families were torn apart,

736
00:43:53,848 --> 00:43:55,633
peoples' lives were wrecked.

737
00:43:55,763 --> 00:43:58,026
Professionals and
unprofessionals were all

738
00:43:58,157 --> 00:44:03,641
just cruelly relegated to
the dustbin of life and history

739
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:06,078
and this force
began to reign supreme.

740
00:44:06,165 --> 00:44:09,211
Mccarthyism is something
that we should never forget,

741
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:11,692
the harm that it did
to so many innocent people

742
00:44:11,823 --> 00:44:14,477
of every race, color and creed.

743
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:17,350
I know people
who jumped off roofs,

744
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,745
I know people who took pills,
tried to die.

745
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:22,529
Some of them didn't
but they were hurt.

746
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,922
A lot of them did die.

747
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:26,533
This was an awful period,
this period.

748
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,404
A lot of people
committed suicide,

749
00:44:28,535 --> 00:44:32,278
not a lot of people but
some people committed suicide

750
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:35,498
and others it just ruined
their careers completely.

751
00:44:35,629 --> 00:44:37,544
I made a pledge,
a solemn pledge.

752
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,676
Do you want
to commit mutiny?

753
00:44:39,764 --> 00:44:41,635
Is it an order?

754
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:44,943
It's an order.

755
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:46,945
I can't, the guy's asleep.

756
00:44:47,075 --> 00:44:48,163
We'll that's a break,
isn't it?

757
00:44:48,294 --> 00:44:50,905
Yeah, but it's like
shooting a sitting duck.

758
00:44:51,036 --> 00:44:56,998
For many of US,
Canada Lee was a huge icon.

759
00:44:57,085 --> 00:45:01,394
He was one of the few actors
who had invaded Hollywood,

760
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:03,962
that brought a black presence
to the screen.

761
00:45:04,092 --> 00:45:06,355
That was very different from
the traditional presence

762
00:45:06,486 --> 00:45:10,272
that blacks were
forced to portray.

763
00:45:10,403 --> 00:45:13,449
He was not a servant,
he was not a buffoon,

764
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,016
he didn't do anything

765
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:18,106
that was against
the dignity of our people.

766
00:45:18,237 --> 00:45:20,152
He was a wonderful actor

767
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:24,373
and the parts that he played
were hugely inspiring.

768
00:45:24,504 --> 00:45:26,462
I'll never forget Canada Lee

769
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:31,641
when we opened in Macbeth,
the Orson Wells production.

770
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:34,775
It took US months,
months and months of hard work

771
00:45:34,862 --> 00:45:37,952
but we enjoyed it
because it was so different.

772
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:42,696
And Canada,
oh, he was in heaven.

773
00:45:42,827 --> 00:45:46,961
And doggone it, if it wasn't
a smash hit, it is history now.

774
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:49,616
Canada played with US
in "Anna lucasta"

775
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,401
for a while, you know?

776
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:55,361
He was a very wonderful person
to work with.

777
00:45:55,491 --> 00:45:58,320
He was a very humorous
person at times.

778
00:45:58,407 --> 00:46:01,280
Canada was committed
to struggle,

779
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:05,327
Canada tried
to improve conditions.

780
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:27,306
♪

781
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:30,048
Can you go alone?

782
00:46:30,178 --> 00:46:31,658
It would be better.

783
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:33,573
You will find me
next door at number 13.

784
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:35,488
There are people
from my church there

785
00:46:35,618 --> 00:46:37,272
but their oldest daughter has
just run away

786
00:46:37,403 --> 00:46:40,275
and is living with
a young loaf off the streets.

787
00:46:40,406 --> 00:46:42,451
Knock there
when you're ready.

788
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,555
And when he went to
South Africa and came back,

789
00:46:59,686 --> 00:47:02,036
he wanted to talk about
the situation in South Africa.

790
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:04,473
Well, at that time
I was producing shows

791
00:47:04,604 --> 00:47:07,433
for the naacp
at Madison square garden.

792
00:47:07,563 --> 00:47:08,956
He came backstage and said

793
00:47:09,087 --> 00:47:11,002
"dick, let me go on,
please, let me go on.

794
00:47:11,132 --> 00:47:12,917
I want to talk
about South Africa."

795
00:47:13,047 --> 00:47:14,527
Finally I let him onstage,

796
00:47:14,657 --> 00:47:17,182
he starts talking about
South Africa and discrimination

797
00:47:17,312 --> 00:47:20,533
and so forth,
and I couldn't get him off.

798
00:47:20,663 --> 00:47:21,882
I had to call and say

799
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:24,450
"hey Canada, come off,
come off, come off."

800
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,669
But he talked about it.

801
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,063
He was a great guy,
Canada Lee.

802
00:47:29,194 --> 00:47:36,679
Canada ran into the general
atmosphere of repression

803
00:47:36,766 --> 00:47:40,988
and I guess it
eventually destroyed him.

804
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,601
Canada paid the price of
going before the authorities,

805
00:47:45,732 --> 00:47:49,562
calling press conferences,
trying to declare his name,

806
00:47:49,692 --> 00:47:51,912
as did Jackie Robinson
who was a great sports figure,

807
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:53,740
as did Hazel Scott,

808
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,178
who was a great musician
and a wonderful woman.

809
00:47:57,309 --> 00:47:59,441
They went before
and tried to play the game

810
00:47:59,572 --> 00:48:02,227
on the basis of the rules
that had been given them

811
00:48:02,357 --> 00:48:05,447
by these various committees
and vigilantes

812
00:48:05,578 --> 00:48:07,449
and none of them succeeded.

813
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,931
The gay and the happy
and the devilish Canada

814
00:48:11,018 --> 00:48:13,847
just absolutely,
slowly disappeared.

815
00:48:13,978 --> 00:48:19,679
He got very quiet,
always thinking.

816
00:48:19,766 --> 00:48:23,378
I do remember the time
when he couldn't get a job

817
00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:27,165
and so he decided he'd go out on
Broadway with a shoeshine stand

818
00:48:27,252 --> 00:48:29,123
and try and get work.

819
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:31,299
He was very angry
about the whole thing

820
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:33,911
and he once made a statement

821
00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:38,263
"I think I'll get me
a shoeshine box

822
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:41,570
and go on 47th street
and Broadway and sit there

823
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:45,705
and wait for white folks to pass
by so I can shine their shoes."

824
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:47,663
That's what Canada Lee said.

825
00:48:47,794 --> 00:48:52,233
At that time he was pretty well
washed up, you know?

826
00:48:52,364 --> 00:48:55,149
And he became
very, very disillusioned

827
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,110
and I hate to say this but...

828
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,113
I'm sure he died of
a broken heart,

829
00:49:02,243 --> 00:49:04,158
I'm positive of it.

830
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:06,465
And when he died,

831
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:12,036
all Harlem turned out
for Canada Lee's funeral.

832
00:49:12,123 --> 00:49:16,605
I never saw such a big crowd at
a funeral in my life.

833
00:49:16,692 --> 00:49:19,260
I know I'll never forget
the funeral,

834
00:49:19,391 --> 00:49:22,568
it was the most quiet,
sad funeral ever.

840
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:17,275
I supposed our first efforts
to prove to ourselves

841
00:50:17,362 --> 00:50:20,626
and to the world that
we were more than cattle,

842
00:50:20,756 --> 00:50:25,674
that we were more than apes
and more then subhuman beings

843
00:50:25,805 --> 00:50:31,289
fit only to plow and to be
worked to death as slaves.

844
00:50:31,419 --> 00:50:34,292
I supposed the first people
who could make a statement

845
00:50:34,422 --> 00:50:36,946
that said we too are human
were those among US

846
00:50:37,077 --> 00:50:43,127
who could sing or dance
or some way be entertaining.

847
00:50:43,214 --> 00:50:47,914
The artist could go
where nobody else could go.

the powerful people,

850
00:50:54,486 --> 00:50:58,446
and say something about what
was happening to the rest of US.

851
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:02,755
When Jackie Robinson testified

852
00:51:02,885 --> 00:51:06,411
before the house unamerican
activities committee,

853
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:11,459
he said something that was
taken out of the newsreel.

854
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:14,288
He said...

855
00:51:14,419 --> 00:51:16,377
"The fact that it is a communist

856
00:51:16,508 --> 00:51:19,685
who denounces injustice
in the courts,

857
00:51:19,815 --> 00:51:22,253
police brutality, and lynching,

858
00:51:22,383 --> 00:51:25,647
doesn't change the truth
of these charges.

859
00:51:25,734 --> 00:51:28,215
Just because communists
kick up a big fuss

860
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:31,566
over racial discrimination
when it suits their purposes,

861
00:51:31,697 --> 00:51:34,787
a lot of people pretend
that the whole issue

862
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:38,269
is a creation of
the communist imagination

863
00:51:38,399 --> 00:51:41,446
and talk about communists
stirring up negroes to protest

864
00:51:41,576 --> 00:51:45,102
only makes the present situation
worse than ever.

865
00:51:45,232 --> 00:51:46,755
Negroes were stirred up
long before there was

866
00:51:46,886 --> 00:51:49,454
a communist party
and will stay stirred up

867
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:53,022
long after the party
has disappeared.

868
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:59,377
Unless Jim crow has
disappeared by then as well."

869
00:51:59,507 --> 00:52:01,030
