00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,316
Yeah, but you can't go
now, it's dark.

363
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:59,753
You better
wait until daylight.

364
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:02,582
Pop said I was to do it,
so I got to do it.

365
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:04,148
Yeah, but when
he told you that,

366
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,976
there were a couple of things
that he didn't count on.

367
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:07,108
Like what?

368
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:09,197
Well, for one thing,

369
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,938
he didn't expect it to be
in the middle of the night.

370
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:12,548
Another he didn't figure
I'd be here.

371
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:14,115
You?

372
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:15,682
Yeah, me--
I can help you.

373
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:16,900
I'm a pretty good
driver.

374
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:17,727
I'll drive you
all the way to Darwin.

375
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:19,903
Get you there
fast too.

376
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:21,035
You shouldn't
bother the good sisters.

377
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:22,645
They got a lot
to do.

378
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:25,692
They got orphans and people
like that to take care of.

379
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:26,736
If you bother the good
sisters,

380
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:28,259
that means
that somebody else,

381
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,000
well, maybe they won't get
the same kind of treatment.

382
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,915
You understand?

383
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:33,874
I guess so.

384
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:35,571
But what about Pop?

385
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:37,094
What are we gonna do
about him?

386
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:38,226
I'll help
you with him too.

387
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,967
How?

388
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:42,056
I'll figure out something
by morning.

389
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:44,885
Hey,
speaking of morning,

390
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:46,843
you better get
some sleep.

391
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:47,627
I don't think your
father'd want you to be up

392
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:49,759
this late even
for him.

393
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,847
I guess I
am a little sleepy.

394
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:00,117
Good night, Pop.

395
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:06,036
Think you'd
better hop into bed.

396
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:13,566
Good night, Flame.

397
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:16,177
Good night, Mr. Stanton.

398
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:21,095
Good night, Shawn.

399
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:23,663
Pleasant dreams to
both of us.

400
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:33,150
Ah, it would take a whole
posse a couple of weeks

401
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:35,152
to flush Garvin
out of country like this.

402
00:23:35,283 --> 00:23:36,153
Yeah, by the time he
was found,

403
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:38,895
he'd be
dead of starvation.

404
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:41,245
I don't think he's anywhere
near here.

405
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:42,986
What makes
you think so?

406
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:44,335
Well, we
know he was able to

407
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:45,728
swipe that outfit that
he's wearing

408
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,426
from a truck driver.

409
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,340
Now he might just have been
as smart enough

410
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,646
to have
hitched another ride.

411
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:52,431
Mmm.

412
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:53,736
Well, that warning against
hitchhikers

413
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:56,696
has been on the radio steady
since yesterday morning.

414
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:58,872
Yeah, but there are
a lot of farmers

415
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:01,222
that don't have
radios in their trucks.

416
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:02,136
Yeah.

417
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:05,182
Oh, relax.

morning and it's a cinch

shall follow me
all of the days of my life

423
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,722

of the Lord forever.

Amen.

goodbye to Pa.

each other "Mister"?

What's on your mind?

430
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,918
Are you sure it's better for
Pop to be buried here

431
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:48,182
than in
a regular cemetery?

432
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:51,272
I mean, maybe the Mother
Superior wouldn't like it.

433

No priest or nothing, just
buried in the woods.

Your father would like
this place, Shawn.

435

He's probably
the kind of man

who was always close
to nature.

You talk
like you knew him.

438
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,548
Pop used to say,

439
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:10,204
"If you're close to nature,
you're close to God."

440
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:12,075
He said
the right things.

okay here.

come this way all right.

difference though.

I'll radio headquarters.

They--

1070
01:01:50,315 --> 01:01:52,534
Hello, Garvin.

1071
01:01:52,665 --> 01:01:54,232
You better get
a doctor for the kid.

1072
01:02:01,282 --> 01:02:03,110
I can wait.

1073
01:02:29,441 --> 01:02:31,660
Hello, Pete.

1074
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:34,359
Hello, son.

1075
01:02:34,489 --> 01:02:36,448
I just talked to
the doctor.

1076
01:02:36,578 --> 01:02:39,233
You got
a pretty bad bump.

1077
01:02:39,364 --> 01:02:42,367
But you're gonna be as good
as new in a couple days.

1078
01:02:42,497 --> 01:02:44,238
Did Flame run away?

1079
01:02:44,369 --> 01:02:45,892
You think he'd go anywhere
without you?

1080
01:02:50,505 --> 01:02:55,206
Pete, don't go away.

1081
01:02:55,336 --> 01:02:57,512
Okay.

1082
01:02:57,643 --> 01:03:00,037
I'll wait as long
as I can.

1083
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:01,821
Then Garvin's stepfather
grabbed the gun

1084
01:03:01,952 --> 01:03:04,781
and was about to shoot
his wife, Garvin's mother.

1085
01:03:04,911 --> 01:03:07,522
But Garvin grabbed him, they
struggled for the gun,

1086
01:03:07,653 --> 01:03:09,655
it went off
and the stepfather was killed.

1087
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:10,917
That was Garvin's story

1088
01:03:11,048 --> 01:03:14,573
but it didn't
sound so good to the jury.

1089
01:03:14,703 --> 01:03:17,445
But it did to you.

1090
01:03:17,576 --> 01:03:19,534
Well, I guess I was closer
to the whole thing

1091
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:21,667
than anybody else.

1092
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,103
You know something,
Mother...

1093
01:03:27,455 --> 01:03:31,459
... a policeman is just
another guy but with a badge,

1094
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:33,592
a human being.

1095
01:03:33,722 --> 01:03:38,075
He's got eyes,
a nose, a mouth, feet, hands,

1096
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:41,774
and most of the times,
he's got a heart.

1097
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:44,385
He has his own opinions
and feelings about everything

1098
01:03:44,516 --> 01:03:46,823
just like everybody else.

1099
01:03:46,953 --> 01:03:50,391
Sometimes he
doesn't want to have feelings.

1100
01:03:50,522 --> 01:03:53,133
Sometimes it's better if
he doesn't.

1101
01:03:53,264 --> 01:03:55,614
Well, you know what I mean.

1102
01:03:55,744 --> 01:03:59,096
I know.

1103
01:03:59,226 --> 01:04:01,620
Well, seeing
as how I was responsible

1104
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,275
for Garvin being in jail

1105
01:04:04,405 --> 01:04:07,278
and seeing as how I didn't
think he was guilty of anything,

1106
01:04:07,408 --> 01:04:09,323
I knew I had to do something
about it.

1107
01:04:09,454 --> 01:04:11,978
It was getting
tough to sleep nights.

1108
01:04:12,109 --> 01:04:12,849
So...

1109
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,461
I asked my pal in homicide over
in Dallas

1110
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:19,333
to help me run
the case down a little more.

1111
01:04:19,464 --> 01:04:22,423
Well, while I was chasing
Garvin all over Texas,

1112
01:04:22,554 --> 01:04:24,730
he really
ran down the case.

1113
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,689
He sent me all the information
just before I came here.

1114
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:30,214
Now I'm
willing to bet ten bucks

1115
01:04:30,344 --> 01:04:31,302
that with this new
evidence,

1116
01:04:31,432 --> 01:04:32,738
the Governor will
be convinced that Garvin

1117
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:33,957
should have a full
pardon.

1118
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:40,702
Won't the fact that
he escaped from prison

1119
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:42,704
count against him?

1120
01:04:42,835 --> 01:04:45,882
Well, normally it would,

1121
01:04:46,012 --> 01:04:47,318
but he's
still an innocent man

1122
01:04:47,448 --> 01:04:49,102
and the way he took care
of the boy

1123
01:04:49,233 --> 01:04:52,366
proves that
he's a good citizen.

1124
01:04:52,497 --> 01:04:54,803
No, I wouldn't be afraid to
go to bat for him

1125
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:56,675
all the way.

1126
01:04:56,805 --> 01:04:58,198
Thank you.

1127
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:03,812
He's asleep.

1128
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:05,727
Well, I'm ready.

1129
01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:08,426
Well, if you want to say
goodbye to anybody,

1130
01:05:08,556 --> 01:05:10,602
it's okay with me.

1131
01:05:10,732 --> 01:05:12,691
Mother, shall we
go ahead?

1132
01:05:12,821 --> 01:05:14,606
We'll walk forward.

1133
01:05:14,736 --> 01:05:16,042
That's always
the best way to go.

1134
01:05:27,053 --> 01:05:28,750
I wonder what it would have
been like in Mexico?
