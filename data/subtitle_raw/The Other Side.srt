00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,960
Subtitled by Victoria Sánchez Mayo

2
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,840
I have never been alone.

3
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,160
Neither do they.

4
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,840
The three of them always together.

5
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,040
18:00.

6
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,880
When they call on the switchboard,

7
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,120
my mother without answering
she tells me that Valentin is already here.

8
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,960
Before leaving I give him a kiss.

9
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,360
Walking down the stairs I run into the neighbor's
the neighbor's dog.

10
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,240
On Valentin Street
is kicking the ball.

11
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,200
And when he sees me he says:
"What's up, sucker!".

12
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,440
And we walked away from the portal.

13
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,600
And I don't want to look
towards my terrace.

14
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,320
I don't want to look,
but I always end up doing it.

15
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,480
And I see my mother leaning out
waving "goodbye" to me.

16
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,680
And I feel like yelling at her:
"Mom, I'm already 15 years old."

17
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,000
But in the end I say nothing.

18
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,560
And I also say goodbye.

19
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,280
And Valentin sees me and laughs.

20
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,680
(Door)

21
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,360
Hello.
Hello.

22
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,200
Do you mind if I smoke?

23
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't.
But you can't smoke here.

24
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,200
Do you know
when the lawyers arrive?

25
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,000
Aren't you Ramón Fortuna?

26
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,000
The door closes and in peace.

27
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,720
We are not going to stand here
talking in a dry way.

28
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,960
The first thing you
you told the police

29
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,200
was that you had killed the man.
It was unintentional.

30
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,520
Well, I don't see the point.

31
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,200
Depending on how you look at it.

32
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,360
It's not funny
that a person has died.

33
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,640
But it's funny
that the person in charge says

34
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
who did it unintentionally.
I am only presumed.

35
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,240
The alleged.

36
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,840
It is the truth. It was unintentional.

37
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,320
We will see what the truth is.

38
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,720
I want you to tell me
everything you did that afternoon.

39
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,840
From what time?

40
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Since lunchtime,
for example.

41
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,000
The three of us ate together.

42
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,960
It was the day of the Pilar
and my sister was not working.

43
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,800
My mother and sister
got ready to go to the movies

44
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,280
to see one of Harrison Ford.
What did you do?

45
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,680
My mother had given me
a movie, "Natural Born Killers".

46
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,480
and had arranged to meet Valentin

47
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,280
to go see her at home.
I almost never bring friends.

48
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,520
Why?

49
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,360
Because my mother
and my sister are there.

50
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,040
And since I don't have
no room to myself.

51
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,480
That you sent them
to the movies to get them off your back.

52
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,120
Have you seen
any of Harrison Ford's movies?

53
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,280
Yes.
Doesn't it seem more normal to you that she

54
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,280
see that one instead of
of "Natural Born Killers"?

55
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,960
And don't you think

56
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,960
is not an appropriate film
for her to give you as a gift?

57
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,840
She didn't choose it.
It was recommended to her by the guy at the video store.

58
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,120
So that afternoon
you met your friend Valentin.

59
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,600
What happened is that when I arrived
to the bank where we always meet,

60
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,080
was giving himself
the beating with an aunt as a sophomore.

61
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,800
He told me he was coming with us.
And you were upset?

62
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,840
Of course. What a plan.

63
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,720
They keep going on and on and on and on and on and on
watching the movie like an idiot.

64
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,520
How do you get along with Valentin?

65
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,280
Well, that's good.
I get along with everyone.

66
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,040
Do you know what I'm doing here, Ramón?
He is a lawyer.

67
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,480
No.

68
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,080
I am not a lawyer. I am your lawyer.

69
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,600
It means that I will
defend you even if you are guilty.

70
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,480
It means that
you have to speak clearly to me.

71
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,680
I'm going to decide what you have
to say about what you have done.

72
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,040
But it is important that you tell me
the whole truth.

73
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,600
Valentin has had it up to here with me.

74
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,840
He is my best friend...

75
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,480
But I have the feeling
that he is taking advantage of me.

76
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,920
To ask for my notes.

77
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,200
To ask me
money every now and then.

78
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,800
To come home
to make out with the girls.

79
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,200
57, 58, 59, 60...

80
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,120
61, 62, 63, 64, 65...

81
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,720
I'm coming!

82
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,360
Hey! The blond guy is
behind the red car!

83
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,720
-Because of Pablo!
-It's no good! He's snitched!

84
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,880
What a bastard!

85
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,400
No, it's a lie. I saw you.

86
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,560
What's with the T-shirt?

87
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,680
We have made it
for the end-of-year trip.

88
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,760
Do you like it?

89
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,960
If you behave yourself,
I'll show you the back.

90
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,480
Get something to eat,
I'm hungry as hell.

91
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,160
When you want beer,
here it is.

92
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,880
If his mother were here

93
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,240
I would have taken some panchitos out of us by now,
some cortecitas...

94
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,960
You don't know how cool
this one's mother is.

95
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,360
You just panchitos and crusts,
you spend three days burping.

96
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,360
That's enough, man. Don't overdo it.
Come on, don't get mad,

97
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,720
If not, Jessi says "Fuck you".
She says, "Fuck you." (LAUGHS)

98
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,080
(Car horn)

99
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,040
Hey, you! Let's see if you stick
your dick up your ass.

100
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,280
-Can't you see they've locked me in?
-What the hell do I care?

101
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,520
Stop now if you don't want it to go down.

102
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,160
Do you want to go inside
and let people live?

103
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,680
The one you're going to get inside
you're the one who's going to get a milk.

104
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,880
Fuck, close it there,
don't be a party pooper.

105
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,640
Don't mess with Ramón,
he'll throw us out on the street.

106
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,800
Yes, yes, go on.
Keep on banging on, go on.

107
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,120
Why don't you open
the can of cockles?

108
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,640
Do you open it or not?

109
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,280
Fuck, that donkey meat
does not show through. (LAUGHS)

110
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,320
Damn, you're a blanket, aren't you?

111
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,380
And who is this guy in the photo?

112
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,100
He is my father.

113
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,320
But this photo is old,

114
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,800
How old is he now?
He is now dead.

115
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,240
Okay, son,
it's not my fault...

116
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,620
But let's see, what about that can?

117
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,740
I'm going to have to go myself in the end.

118
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,320
As always.

119
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,080
What the hell are you doing?

120
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,280
I'll open it while I'm at home.

121
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,080
Okay, but if it falls again,
I don't duck.

122
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,720
Come on, open it now, dammit.

123
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,640
(Cough)

124
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,680
What's up?

125
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,760
But, man, what have you done?

126
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,520
Have you cut his throat
for a can?

127
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,800
He cut her throat!

128
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,080
He cut her throat
for a can!

129
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,360
What's the matter, girl?

130
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,480
His throat has been cut
for a can.

131
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,960
What have you done, you bastard?

132
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,160
Calm down,
I haven't done anything.

133
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,640
If you come any closer, I'll shoot.

134
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,160
Son of a bitch, leave the girl,
I'm coming over there and I'll kill you.

135
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,680
Please be still.

136
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,880
Release the girl.

137
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,360
(SCREAMS)

138
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,520
(Shouting)

139
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,240
Call the ambulance.

140
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,960
Valentin, man.

141
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,720
You don't scare me, motherfucker.

142
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,120
Let me pass,
I haven't done anything.

143
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,080
I must wait
for my mother to come.

144
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,120
You're going to kill her in a heartbeat.

145
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,920
A father who would give you two smackers
was needed.

146
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,560
Let me go.
This way I'll have you

147
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,480
until they come to arrest you.

148
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,720
(barking)

149
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,360
Ramón, what is it, Ramón?

150
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,280
(barking)

151
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,440
Shut up.

152
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,960
(barking)

153
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,200
(Melancholic music)

154
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,640
(Melancholic music)

155
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,080
Fuck, Ramón...

156
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,920
All day together.

157
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,000
They will end up burying us
in a mass grave.

158
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,080
You and me, there alone.

159
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,480
Underground.

160
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,480
What have you done to him?

161
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,280
(THEY SPEAK AT THE SAME TIME)

162
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,120
Where are you going?

163
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,720
To the Fortuna's house.

164
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,640
It is in 4ºA.

165
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,360
Thank you very much.

166
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,280
Good night.
Good night.

167
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,640
Who is it?

168
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,560
I am Marcelo, the lawyer.

169
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,680
Marcelo...

170
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,800
but what do you mean, the lawyer?

171
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,920
My goodness,
how like your father you are.

172
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,080
And how handsome you look.

173
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,520
Come in, come in.

174
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,840
Thank goodness you're back.

175
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,840
What would we have done?

176
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,120
If we are desperate
for all of this.

177
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,320
Hello, Marcelo.

178
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,760
Gloria?

179
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,160
I don't know if I would have been able
to recognize you.

180
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,360
You wouldn't have recognized her,
it's been so long since you've seen each other...

181
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,360
We remember you and your parents
of you and your parents.

182
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,560
That's why we don't think of anyone else

183
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,400
when we were told that Ramón
needed a lawyer.

184
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,720
You don't know how hard we had it
until we found you.

185
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,960
The worst thing is
the neighbor across the street.

186
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,080
Every time I meet his wife
his wife on the street,

187
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,240
I don't know where to look.

188
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,200
When will they let me come to see you?

189
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,960
You can go whenever you want.

190
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,360
There are no bars,
no call shops.

191
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,000
It is more like a school.

192
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,880
Yes, but there is nothing
like a mother's house.

193
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,080
What do we have to do now?

194
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,560
Be patient.
I already told your daughter on the phone

195
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,800
that juvenile trials
are fast,

196
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,720
but the judge has to
to review the prosecutor's report

197
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,560
and you have to wait
for the girl and the friend to talk.

198
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,640
Poor Valentine.

199
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,280
I have come alone
to keep her quiet.

200
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,400
And to make them think a little
if they really want to

201
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,120
to take care of Ramon.

202
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,440
I have just arrived in Madrid.

203
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,520
So far, I have only dealt with
money matters.

204
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,960
I have spoken to the public defender
who accompanied them with the prosecutor

205
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,760
and he could take it forward
without any problems.

206
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,120
We do not want it to be handled by
a public defender,

207
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,840
we want you to be helped by
someone you trust.

208
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,720
Don't worry about anything.

209
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,880
I have to go now.
Already?

210
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,680
But aren't you staying for dinner?

211
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,120
Thank you very much,

212
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,040
but it's late and my wife and child
are waiting for me.

213
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,600
A child, how old?

214
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,240
One and a half years.

215
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,280
And your parents without seeing it...

216
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,600
Oh, how life is...

217
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,480
It's a good thing Ramón's father
didn't see what happened to him.

218
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,160
Okay, Mom, that's enough.
Let him go, he's in a hurry.

219
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,200
Don't be heavy.
It's not being heavy.

220
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,360
Before you go
I want to give you a present.

221
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
It's a picture of your father
and my husband.

222
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,680
I've had it in storage for years,
but it's you who should have it.

223
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,320
You'll see how handsome he looks.

224
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,000
If I were alive, I would be proud of you.

225
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,680
So many years of work
for you to study,

226
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,760
and now you are a full-fledged lawyer.

227
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,920
Why don't you take out the album?
I'm sure we'll find more photos.

228
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,000
That he has said he is leaving.
Another day.

229
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,880
Well, I'm going to look for them

230
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,560
and by the time you get back,
I'll have them out of the way.

231
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,480
Thank you very much.
Thanks to you.

232
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,760
Forgive her, these days
her head is a little off.

233
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,840
She is much more cautious.

234
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,160
Don't worry.

235
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,560
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

236
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,360
Marcelo,

237
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,600
I just wanted to tell you
don't forget Ramon

238
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,040
and thank you again.

239
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,640
This boy was in no hurry to leave the neighborhood.
to leave the neighborhood.

240
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,040
Why is that?

241
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,520
Well, I don't know.

242
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,920
And to Barcelona, no less.

243
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,520
And his father here alone.

244
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,800
After all
what you did for him...

245
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,560
Sometimes children are very unfair.

246
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,440
So much effort, so much work...

247
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,080
everything for them.

248
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,640
Even if we are sometimes wrong.

249
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,800
Do you remember this box?

250
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,520
I'm going to bed.

251
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,440
Do you like cats,
Sir?

252
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,360
There are people in the neighborhood
who do not like animals

253
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,880
and they see it as wrong for me to feed
cats,

254
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,640
but of course,
as I am already 85 years old,

255
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,440
I don't care what they think of me.

256
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,920
I feed the cats, that's all.
the cats, that's all.

257
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,520
Well, then... goodbye, sir.

258
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,560
Good night.
Good night.

259
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,640
Marcelo, I'm a little scared,

260
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,200
Jaime is 38 and he won't stop coughing and crying.
and crying.

261
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,000
There is no way to get it down,
I don't know what to do.

262
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,360
Please do not delay.

263
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,000
It's me again. The child is better.

264
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,920
Where are you?

265
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,880
Keep on sleeping.

266
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,720
-Let's go!
-Hey, come on, let's go!

267
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,120
You are Ramón Fortuna, aren't you?

268
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:40,840
Yes.

269
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,000
Says the Perico...

270
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,520
Do you know the Perico?

271
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,800
No.
It is one that is here.

272
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,440
He says you've killed
a guy

273
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,440
and that your friend is dying.

274
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,160
And why did you kill that guy?
I didn't kill anyone.

275
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,480
Just knowing that your friend
you didn't want to kill him is enough for me.

276
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,720
It's bad for me to sleep with a guy
who wanted to kill his friend.

277
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,560
I didn't mean to kill him,
I cut his throat unintentionally.

278
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,400
Don't you brush your teeth?
Is it mandatory?

279
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,960
No, you brush them
if you want, look at my teeth.

280
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,880
What do you notice?
That they are clean.

281
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,640
And what else?
I don't know, nothing.

282
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,720
The two paddles
above are false, man.

283
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,240
Can't you tell?
No, it doesn't.

284
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,400
I had them fitted last week.

285
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,560
I have been waiting for them for a year.

286
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,600
One year of Vicente's work in Social Security
in Social Security.

287
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,280
Do you know Vicente?
No.

288
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,720
Vicente is the assistant.

289
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,560
One year for the guy to get
to get my teeth for free

290
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,400
and the dentist said to me:
"Let's see what you do now."

291
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,160
Every night, every night
with the brush for five minutes.

292
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,720
Damn, that's good.

293
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,240
I have been called the nicked one.

294
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,560
Mellado here, Mellado there.
Now I've cut them off.

295
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,800
If they talk to you about the nicked one,
they talk about me.

296
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,120
But of course, I'm not a nicked man anymore.
Fuck them.

297
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,000
What did your mother say?
About what?

298
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,600
That you have killed many people.
That I haven't killed anyone.

299
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,720
That you are here,
what did he say?

300
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,840
I'll see if I get out soon.
What a rush your mother is in.

301
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,080
Mine said the longer I'm here, the better for the world.
I'm here, the better for the world.

302
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,720
For the world in general.

303
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,840
And what have you done?
I don't remember.

304
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,360
I've been here for a long time.

305
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,360
Last year I was catching
horse in the Blackfeet

306
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,340
and that's where I got busted. But the horse
was not for me, I don't get on it.

307
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,360
And who was it for?

308
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,400
I'm going to tell you.

309
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,440
I didn't tell the prosecutor, with that....

310
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,560
(Door)

311
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,920
I'm sure it's Vicente. Enter.

312
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,080
Hello, Ramón, how are you? How are you?

313
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,200
How is it going to be? Fucking great.

314
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,840
I'm asking him.

315
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,200
Thank you.

316
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,240
But tell him you are Vicente.

317
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,200
I am Vicente.
The assistant.

318
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,240
Come on, Aníbal, please,
it's very late, huh?

319
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,120
And let him sleep.

320
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,760
Why don't you stay a while?
Until 23:30.

321
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,840
Because I am very tired.

322
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,400
Most of all
of listening to you all day long.

323
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,120
Did you take the pills?
Yes.

324
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,480
All of them?
Yes, man.

325
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,440
Well, go to sleep
and let the others sleep.

326
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,720
Tomorrow you have to take me
to the eye doctor, don't forget.

327
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,800
But how can I forget?
If I live for you.

328
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,680
Come on, if you need anything,
I'm just down the hall

329
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,160
at the last door
on the left, right?

330
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,240
If you need anything, I am here.

331
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,640
Oh, right.

332
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,480
You know, you ask him, right?

333
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,680
See you tomorrow.

334
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,040
Would you like to?
No, thank you.

335
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,360
You know what Chino told me,
man? He told me to be careful with you

336
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,480
because you had been searched
your bag and you had a knife.

337
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,520
It's a lie.
I know that.

338
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,960
I registered it for you later,
but I didn't do it for gossip.

339
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,880
I did it to sleep peacefully.

340
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,520
That Chinese guy is
a motherfucker, man, be careful.

341
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,160
You know, I better
think you've taken out four of them.

342
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,160
You tell him six, let him be scared.

343
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,600
I'm glad you didn't
you didn't kill anyone.

344
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,320
I've seen dead people, man.

345
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,480
I saw one who stayed like this.

346
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,320
With the beak on,
it was a dead man who looked like a living man.

347
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,200
But of course, it's not the same
sleeping with a murderer.

348
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:00,760
If I saw you and said:
"This one didn't kill anyone".

349
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,560
And your father, what did he say?

350
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,040
My father is dead.
Is he dead now too?

351
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,160
No, he died many years ago.

352
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,800
What a scare, man. That would
that would have been a real pain in the ass.

353
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,680
I haven't seen mine
since I've been here.

354
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,240
It was not my fault.
I know that.

355
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,400
They have done very well bringing you here.

356
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,480
Now they will be able to say that:

357
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,720
"If this kid had had a father.
a father.

358
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,520
What would I have been like
if I'd had you?

359
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,920
If I had lived?

360
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,880
I would have scared away that pair of women
that haven't let you breathe.

361
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,040
That night
I would have beaten you up.

362
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,640
I would have been wrong

363
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,880
and now you would be hating me.

364
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,640
This is impossible.

365
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,840
Nothing is impossible, son.

366
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,880
What's wrong with this kid,
Why is he so thin?

367
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,240
Take a lot of pills.

368
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,840
I think he is sick.
Poor thing.

369
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,280
His father hasn't been
to see him for a whole year.

370
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,880
God gives bread to the one who
has no teeth, son.

371
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,320
Where are you going?

372
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,480
Well, where am I going to go? Well, home.

373
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,800
My goodness, how you have grown.

374
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,360
How old are you?
15.

375
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,920
15 years,

376
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,880
what a barbarity.

377
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,880
Why don't you want
to be a railroader like me?

378
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,120
I just don't like it.

379
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,000
I want to be a computer technician.
Computer Scientist?

380
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,360
What nonsense,
but it has no future.

381
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,640
A lifetime.

382
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,600
You only live once.

383
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:14,920
What about this one?

384
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,440
It's Mom.

385
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,200
It is necessary to know that this life...

386
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,200
How old she is.

387
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,440
It is that little is fixed.

388
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,080
Well, I don't like it anymore.

389
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,600
How old she has become.

390
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,120
But, Dad, he's 60 years old.

391
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,320
I have never liked
old women like that.

392
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,800
It's a good thing I'm dead, so
I don't have to sleep with her.

393
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,520
(Prayer)

394
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,520
But she doesn't know how to talk,
she howls because she is very lonely.

395
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,200
Sometimes, the acute hearing
of their adoptive species

396
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,440
listens to his call.

397
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,240
My child.

398
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,880
No boyfriend?

399
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,880
He had one some time ago.

400
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,800
But I think he left her.

401
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,400
Everything is so changed.

402
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,680
I should have been back much earlier.

403
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,800
The drum, "rum, pon, pon".

404
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,520
Yes.
That one?

405
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,480
The clock, "tick, tick, tick".

406
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,640
"Pa?

407
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,200
Are you still angry?
No.

408
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,960
Yeah, you never get angry, do you?

409
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,440
I never get angry, no.

410
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,200
The boy asked me
to go see his mother.

411
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,840
And you didn't hear my messages?

412
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,160
The child had a fever,
I was scared.

413
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,240
Sara, I couldn't leave him there.

414
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,200
Dad?

415
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,120
Come on, let's have breakfast.

416
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,560
Have you told him yet?

417
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,280
Does this mean that
you're going to take over the case?

418
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,520
Yes.

419
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,600
Well, it's a change.

420
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,520
Yes, but just now
we have just arrived.

421
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,960
With the house unassembled,
the office work.

422
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,800
I would have liked to
I would have liked to take it easier.

423
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,240
Marcelo, you want to help
those people, don't you?

424
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,800
Of course.
That's it then.

425
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,160
Don't give it any more thought.

426
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,360
Have you spoken to the prosecutor?
Yes.

427
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,640
¿Y?

428
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,640
When he questioned the boy,
he could barely get anything coherent out of him.

429
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,760
In addition, with all the fuss that was made
with the press and television,

430
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,440
the boy was very nervous.

431
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,360
That's why I sent him to the center.

432
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,920
He seems convinced
that it was all an accident.

433
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,080
How was the boy?
Fine, he seemed calm.

434
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,400
Almost too much.
What about your mother?

435
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,400
She is a stronger woman
than she looks.

436
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,840
Poor thing, it must have been very hard.

437
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,320
And how have you seen the neighborhood?

438
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,840
They brought the sofa, didn't they?

439
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,560
Of course they brought
the sofa, otherwise I wouldn't be here.

440
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,880
You always do that to me, huh?

441
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,800
I asked you
if your neighborhood has changed much.

442
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,320
It was nighttime.

443
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,680
The boy told me
that after the accidents

444
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,280
had gone to a park.

445
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,840
That before going
to see his mother, he went there.

446
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,400
When I was little,
when I got out of school,

447
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,680
I was always going to play
soccer in that area

448
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,280
and there was no park.

449
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,120
That was the end of the neighborhood.

450
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,760
In the spring, the women
would go with chairs to sew.

451
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,840
And the grass grew so tall
that it covered us completely.

452
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,240
I have remembered
that place many times.

453
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,680
Help me.

454
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,320
Ten.

455
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,920
What are you going to do today?

456
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,120
Now come the movers

457
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,320
and this afternoon
take the child to the pediatrician.

458
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,400
I will accompany you.

459
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,360
Not if we're going to live here,
I have to manage on my own.

460
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,880
You don't know what Madrid is like
on a weekday and by car.

461
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,160
What are you talking about?

462
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,680
Look, we do one thing.

463
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,000
You go to work
in a cab, I take my car

464
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,680
and when you leave the pediatrician,
we pick you up.

465
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,160
I think it's a hassle,
but whatever you say.

466
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,320
(Phone)

467
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,040
I'll take it, it will be my mother.

468
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,360
Hi, I knew it was you.

469
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:38,280
(SPEAKS IN CATALAN)

470
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,880
Would you have liked
your father had lived?

471
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,320
When he died, I was two years old.

472
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,200
So it's like
I've never met him before.

473
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,280
Is it possible to miss
miss a stranger?

474
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,880
I don't know,
is what I want you to tell me.

475
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,320
I have my mother,
my sister, my friends.

476
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,320
Above all, Valentin.

477
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,240
I have known him for many years.

478
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,800
We are very close friends.
Is there anything about you that you don't like?

479
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,000
Don't like it?

480
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,760
Well, like everyone else, right?

481
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,080
I just don't think
it's not important.

482
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,520
What you tell me is important.

483
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,360
Yeah, but it doesn't seem normal to me
to tell anyone that...

484
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,160
The situation
in which we find ourselves

485
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,480
is not very normal,
don't you think so, Ramón?

486
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,840
Maybe I'd like to have
I'd like to have some beard already.

487
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,760
I would also like to be thinner.

488
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,880
No pimples.

489
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,200
I would also like to be blond.

490
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,760
Do you find it hard to talk about yourself?

491
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,120
A little, actually.

492
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,880
You still haven't answered
the question from before.

493
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,680
Which one?
If you miss your father.

494
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,120
No, I already told you that he died
when I was two years old.

495
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,120
So it's like
I've never met him before.

496
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,640
How's your hand?

497
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,320
Well, it doesn't hurt anymore.

498
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,440
I brought you
a change of clothes and socks.

499
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,960
This morning we also
we have been given here.

500
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,400
But these are yours.

501
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,080
I brought you some flan.

502
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,480
Thank you.

503
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,120
And also this book.

504
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,600
I guess you'll have time to read here.
you will have time to read.

505
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:37,680
Yes.

506
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,960
Have you met anyone?
Who are you going to meet here?

507
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,440
Just my roommate.

508
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,400
Now in the morning
they are all in high school.

509
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,000
I have also been talking
with the psychologist.

510
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,240
With the psychologist?

511
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,680
And what did he tell you?
If I may ask.

512
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,680
To tell him about me,
what I liked and what I didn't like.

513
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,280
Of what you liked and not what?
About me.

514
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,520
And what will that matter to her?
Mom, it's her job.

515
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,880
What an ugly job, to go around
meddling in people's lives.

516
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,960
They could have found a nicer one.

517
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,480
Besides, you don't
you don't need a psychologist.

518
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,240
What you need
is the love of your mother and sister.

519
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,040
Has he asked you anything about us?

520
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,360
No, not from you, from dad.
From daddy?

521
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,960
My poor darling.

522
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,600
13 years dead
and still they do not leave him alone.

523
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,880
What, how are you doing?

524
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,320
Good.

525
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,160
What about you?

526
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,160
Are we still like this?

527
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,040
Fuck, you don't have
you have no nerve or anything.

528
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,640
Hey, he's better at writing
in a notebook than talking.

529
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,760
Let's see.

530
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,800
Yes, sir, this is Ramón.
What about you?

531
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,520
Have you already introduced yourself?

532
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,000
No? Ramón, this is Antonio.

533
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,120
He has undergone surgery for angina
and has been unable to speak for several days.

534
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,680
But since the doctor
said that she is already well,

535
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,400
day after tomorrow, right?

536
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,920
How was your day?

537
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,480
Well, this morning
I talked to the psychologist

538
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,200
and then my mother and sister
my mother and my sister came to see me.

539
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,560
Well, that's good, isn't it?
Yes.

540
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,240
I have not killed anyone.

541
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,400
You're such an ass.

542
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,840
Antoñito.

543
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,960
Do you like to read?

544
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,280
My sister brought me a book.
Which one?

545
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,640
History of time.

546
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,000
I couldn't finish it.

547
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,640
But I think
that you are going to like it very much.

548
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,640
Your sister has done well to bring you
one, because I don't know if

549
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,280
what you are going to find here
is very interesting.

550
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:08,200
To read other things
you have a public library.

551
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,760
Vicente, I'm leaving,
I'll call you on the phone.

552
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,560
Ramón,

553
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,640
don't pay any attention to the nonsense
they have said about you.

554
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,480
You don't have to lock yourself in,
but keep in mind that

555
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,160
sooner or later
you have to go back to school.

556
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,160
If you don't like yours, it doesn't matter.
You can come to one we have here.

557
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,000
(Door)

558
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:06,880
You are the one from Vallecas, right?

559
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,880
Yes, but I haven't killed anyone.
I don't care about that.

560
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,280
If you want, keep it,
I haven't seen anything.

561
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,200
But maybe something about you is coming.

562
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,800
Don't let Vicente see it,
he'll get upset.

563
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,400
And if he catches it,
don't say I gave it to you.

564
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,680
(Door)

565
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,040
(Door)

566
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,080
Come on, man, do you read the newspaper?

567
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,360
How about this?
Mine.

568
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,680
But weren't you from Vallecas?
And what does that have to do with it?

569
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,720
I have not read a newspaper.

570
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,600
They are the leaves that the Parakeet passes.

571
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,080
This was given to you by Perico, wasn't it?
I don't know who Perico is.

572
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,560
I'm sure he gave it to you,
he reads the newspaper every day.

573
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,400
If you find something from someone
who is here, he gives it to you.

574
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,280
He says he wants to be a librarian.

575
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,240
It seems to me that not even he
knows what that means.

576
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,360
Have you found anything?
No, not yet.

577
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,880
Search well, if he has given it to you....
But man, don't be a pain.

578
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,720
Have you had your snack yet?
I'm so hungry I can't see.

579
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:27,040
I'm going to pee
and we're going to have a snack together.

580
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,400
I'm going to bed.
Have you gone to sleep yet?

581
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,440
Aren't you cold?

582
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,840
Is this Ramon's file?
Yes.

583
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,160
Have you talked to your boss yet?

584
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,560
Yes.
¿Y?

585
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,120
There is no problem.

586
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,120
I hope it will be fast.

587
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,720
It would be different
if I were of legal age.

588
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,880
And the family
of the deceased has not filed a complaint.

589
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,920
The boy says it was an accident.

590
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,040
Yes.

591
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,480
And you believe him?

592
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,600
(SIGHS) I don't know.

593
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,160
If you help him,
you should trust him.

594
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,160
And shouldn't it be the other way around?

595
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,800
He's a kid.
You have to earn it first.

596
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,960
You were right this morning.
What's that?

597
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:28,600
Well, I got lost
on my way from the pediatrician to your office.

598
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,640
And we've been driving around
in the car from traffic jam to traffic jam.

599
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,920
I got a little nervous.

600
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,000
It had been a long time
since something like this had happened to me.

601
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,760
Of not knowing where you are,

602
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,840
or where you have to go.

603
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,360
Not that I was afraid, but....

604
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,880
I don't know.

605
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,960
I felt...

606
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,480
Shall we go?

607
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:16,880
Yes.

608
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,440
What is this?

609
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,560
It's your father, isn't it?

610
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,500
Yes.

611
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,300
And the one next to him
is Ramón's.

612
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:31,980
Did they know each other?

613
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:33,780
They worked together.

614
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,280
They became friends
in the underground union.

615
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:38,960
You had not told me about him.

616
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,200
"Everyone wants to know
where that terrible failure was

617
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,440
that was feeding

618
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,760
a murderous and vengeful personality
and vengeful personality.

619
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,400
At what moment
that harmonious personality

620
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,560
unfolded and grew up,
in the secrets,

621
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,480
to another RFM
who lacked any mercy whatsoever".

622
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:22,120
This morning I met
Gordo's wife.

623
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,880
I was walking on the other sidewalk
and he stared at me.

624
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,480
Hasn't he said anything to you?
Not a peep.

625
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,880
He wanted to say something,
but he didn't say anything.

626
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,040
I haven't told your sister anything
and don't go and tell her,

627
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,040
I'm sure he'll tell me off.

628
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:37,520
Lately there is no one who can stand her.

629
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,640
This is already cured.

630
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,520
I brought you some fruit.

631
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:47,960
There is a little bit of everything.

632
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,080
One is ready to eat
and the other is a little harder.

633
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,240
This way it does not spoil.

634
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,280
You leave it in your room
and you'll see how good it gets.

635
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,200
I have already told you
that I have everything.

636
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:58,840
Fruit is never left over.

637
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,440
Sorry.

638
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,680
Do you have to watch TV
now that Ramón has a visitor?

639
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,080
-Let him be, if the boy doesn't bother.
-If it's not just for that.

640
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,480
You have other things to do,
don't you?

641
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,480
In five minutes
I want to see you in your room.

642
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,000
(Door)

643
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:22,160
Come on, open it.

644
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,720
No, look, tell him not to come.

645
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,960
It just gets really heavy.

646
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,120
Give him a kiss for me, okay?

647
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,640
See you later.

648
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,000
What are you looking at, nicked?

649
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,920
I have an answering machine
fucking great

650
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:19,240
for those who want it.

651
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,120
And what do we want that for?

652
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,240
When you don't want to pick up the phone.

653
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,080
-To send you messages.
-But what phone?

654
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,720
Is someone calling you?

655
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,640
You're hung up, man.

656
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,280
-Where did you get it?
-From the Corte Inglés.

657
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,920
From an exhibition,
in front of a watchman.

658
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,720
And don't let Vicente know about it.

659
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:41,040
-You could have caught something else.
-Come on, he's talking.

660
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,640
-Better than you 20 times.
-Since when do you speak?

661
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:45,880
How does it feel to not talk?

662
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:49,600
-It's fucking great.
-Yes, man. Fucking great.

663
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,040
My grandfather called
and I didn't talk to him.

664
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,960
I would write to Vicente
what he wanted to say and read it.

665
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,640
What a drag
Vicente finding out everything.

666
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:01,320
-Of course, talking to your grandfather....
-Vicente!

667
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:02,680
(LAUGHING)

668
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,440
What a fool you are.

669
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,440
Screw you guys.

670
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:09,840
Here.

671
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,360
But what are you looking for?

672
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,800
Have you ever seen a giant peanut?
Something like this.

673
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,720
A what?
It's all the same, let it go.

674
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:32,520
Do not leave anything in the room.

675
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,440
Patricio steals anything he can find
he can find.

676
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,880
He snatched a thousand bucks from my drawer.
Well, I don't know if it was him.

677
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,880
Poor Patricio, man.
He's going to eat the answering machine.

678
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,000
Does your mother have one?
No, why not?

679
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,520
You could have given it to him,

680
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,240
since he comes to see you
every other day.

681
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,440
What luck.

682
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,960
We're going to be stiff.
So don't smoke.

683
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:28,960
Will you let me see
what Perico has given you?

684
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,320
Is it ok?
I don't know.

685
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,360
But it's almost half a page.

686
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,240
And that's all about you?
Almost everything.

687
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,880
That has not even happened to the Chinese.

688
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,600
You always talk about Chino.

689
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,800
You have to be careful with him,
because he'll do it to you right away.

690
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,520
According to you, anyone can do it for you.
Do you know its history?

691
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:56,040
A few months ago,
he had a crush on an aunt in high school.

692
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,520
I would pick her up after school every day.
class every day.

693
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,200
Until one day, it occurs to him,
suddenly, he decides to open a car.

694
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,000
So he opens it and goes to look for
the girl to show off.

695
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,880
They mess up, they mess up
and end up in Portugal.

696
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,160
And along the way
opening more cars.

697
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,560
Until, on the fourth day, they were caught.
They even took pictures of them.

698
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,680
To the girl at home,
with some teddy bears,

699
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,000
and the Chinese
entering the prosecutor's office.

700
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,680
And Vicente insisted.
"That you put on a hood."

701
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,160
As if he were an ETA member.

702
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,840
And I told him no,
that I wanted my picture.

703
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,040
And so I leave.

704
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,600
When I'm like this, I laugh,
they take my picture

705
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,920
and I come out laughing my head off, of course.

706
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,000
And that Vicente said he had a bad prognosis.
that he had a bad prognosis.

707
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,960
Have you seen my picture?
No.

708
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,960
But there are no photos here.

709
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,960
I just don't care for this
doesn't say anything to me.

710
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,000
If there are no photos, it's business as usual.

711
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,640
Fuck, he tells us the fucking story
every day.

712
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,200
Don't you go to high school?

713
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,080
No, not yet.

714
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,520
Antonio says that your mother
always comes and brings things,

715
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,320
but if you need anything,

716
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,600
you ask me for it
and I bring it to you.

717
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,920
Anything at a bargain price.

718
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,440
Thank you.

719
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,240
This guy doesn't look to me
he could have killed anyone.

720
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,760
Well, you trust and you will see.

721
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:29,760
"Dear friend:

722
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,440
I read your article
and I was impressed.

723
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:42,240
He says that I am a victim
of the culture of violence

724
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:45,760
that leads innocent, ignorant people to crime.
ignorant people to crime.

725
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,760
I'm glad you believe in my innocence,
but I would like to tell you something.

726
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,160
He says I tried to imitate
the violence

727
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,680
of the video film.

728
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:59,120
But with what happened,
I couldn't even start it.

729
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,840
I wanted a kilo of plums
and one kiwi.

730
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:04,720
I am not violent.

731
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,680
I have always been quiet.

732
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:10,880
My mother was always worried
that I would come back with a bump

733
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,000
and said I had to defend myself,

734
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:15,320
But that's the way I am,
what can I do".

735
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,280
"I am not ignorant.

736
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,200
I don't know if it's okay for me to say it.

737
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,520
I am one of the best readers
in my class.

738
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,480
Now I am reading 'History of time'.

739
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,760
My sister says
that something will stay with me.

740
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,600
Anyway, the article
I loved it.

741
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:35,160
Look, really, Ramón,
don't be an asshole.

742
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,880
That guy doesn't care
what happens to you or not.

743
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,880
Forget about newspapers.

744
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,240
Don't read them
or even think of responding.

745
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,120
Can't you see that this is serious?

746
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,800
I just wanted to tell you...
You don't have to say anything.

747
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,040
They brought you
so they wouldn't bother you.

748
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:51,480
To avoid talking nonsense
to journalists.

749
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,440
So be quiet.

750
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,160
For your sake. Is that clear?
Yes.

751
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:09,200
I'm going to tell Vicente
that we are going for a drink.

752
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,120
Where are you going?

753
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:13,160
To have a drink with my lawyer.

754
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:14,840
Are you going out?

755
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,840
But you never go out.
Today you do.

756
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,520
Can I come?

757
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:22,960
No.

758
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:51,480
Do you want something?
I can ask Vicente to come.

759
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,560
Yes, tell him to come.

760
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:42,160
What do you want to drink, Ramón,
that you're gone.

761
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,320
One Coca-Cola

762
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,680
and, if you don't mind lending me
money,

763
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:50,520
I would like to
to eat something for a snack.

764
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,640
When we get back to the center
I'll give it back to you.

765
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,640
Come on, man, ask for whatever you want.

766
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:14,480
You look better with a side parting.

767
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,280
How is it going with your mother?
Fine.

768
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:40,760
No, not good.

769
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,920
You told Gloria
not to go every day.

770
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,920
I told him not to go
because he won't let me...

771
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,960
He arrives, starts to cry and I...

772
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,600
Is it bad for your mother to worry?

773
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,440
He means well,
but he makes a fool of me.

774
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,440
You are made a fool of by them all.

775
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,680
No, not everyone.
Not you, for example.

776
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,240
I'm giving you a piece of my mind now.

777
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,240
But you don't treat me like a child.
Try to understand your mother.

778
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,360
Did he tell you to talk to me?
No, man.

779
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,320
I do it because I believe
I have to do it.

780
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:33,960
Did you know my father?

781
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,240
Yes.

782
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:43,480
I used to see him on Sundays when he would meet
with mine for a ride.

783
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,640
Sometimes your sister would come.

784
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,280
They were good friends

785
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,120
and I was very fond of him
because...

786
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,320
I wanted to ask you a question.

787
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,440
I just don't know where I have to spend
Christmas.

788
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,080
You don't have to
stay in the center.

789
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,480
You can go home.

790
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:22,800
You have time to think about it.
I just don't want to go home.

791
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,120
I am fine where I am.

792
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,160
It would be very sad
for your mother if you did not go.

793
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:32,400
It would also be sad for me to go
and for her to be always crying.

794
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,000
My sister consoling her
and me not knowing what to do.

795
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:41,480
You can tell him that it's better
that I stay in the center.

796
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:42,840
That is nonsense.

797
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:44,160
Come on, please!

798
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,840
Have you finished it yet?
Almost.

799
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:57,960
What a guy! And what is it about?

800
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,720
Well, of time in general.
Since the beginning of the world.

801
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,920
I like that science fiction stuff.

802
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,360
No, this is just science.

803
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,520
It's about the formation
of the earth and that.

804
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,480
Not anymore. For me, thinking
about space makes me nervous.

805
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,960
I prefer that God arrived,
on Monday he created the sea,

806
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,560
on Tuesday the rivers
and on Wednesday the animals.

807
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,520
But thinking about the universe
for the sake of it, I don't like it.

808
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:20,880
Neither did my mother.

809
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,920
One day I told him that man comes from the monkey and all that
comes from the monkey and all that,

810
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,520
and slapped me.

811
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:31,200
I think it's broken.
But man, don't be handy!

812
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:35,960
Did you hear about Antonio? He's leaving.

813
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,360
To live with his grandfather.

814
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,360
It has been seen and not seen.

815
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:45,120
Hannibal, what?
What?

816
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:48,880
What do you mean? That the teeth
are not brushed here. Let's go to the bathroom.

817
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,840
Ramón, you have a call.

818
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:01,560
I just got off the phone
with Valentin's mother.

819
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,680
He has finally testified
at the hospital and agrees with you.

820
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:08,040
From now on
everything will be much easier.

821
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:37,760
(Crickets)

822
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,320
Again uncle.

823
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,080
We don't have
enough of our own

824
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,680
that on top of that we have
to organize it for them.

825
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,000
-Some will go home, won't they?
-Yes, yes.

826
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,640
Like the Chinese last year
on Christmas Eve.

827
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:36,320
His father almost killed him
by a beating for a silly thing.

828
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,680
It's because Chino
is a special case.

829
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,720
See, that's what pisses me off.

830
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:45,320
He believes that, so do we
and in the end he doesn't raise his head.

831
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:47,560
What are you going to do?

832
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,840
You too
with the little question of the balls.

833
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,760
I don't know, man.

834
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:03,520
Because if they don't show up
Hannibal's parents

835
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,000
and I hope they don't show up.

836
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,960
He will ask me to stay
at least on Christmas Eve.

837
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,840
And who says no?

838
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:12,560
How are you doing?

839
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,400
It is still below 200.

840
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,480
But come on, it's fine.
It's pretty good.

841
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,240
If it were not Hannibal, it would be someone else.

842
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,440
Yeah, but it's Hannibal.

843
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:34,040
You didn't see him when he arrived.
You don't know how bad it was.

844
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,880
And what it has cost us
to get it off the ground.

845
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,760
(Phone)

846
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:03,280
Take it so they don't wake up.

847
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:08,840
(Phone)

848
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,720
Yes?

849
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,080
But do you know what time it is?

850
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:18,680
About Valentin?
I found out last night after I saw you.

851
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:22,840
Your sister has already called you, hasn't she?

852
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,760
Besides, I have
other things to do.

853
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,520
I don't know if you know
that I don't live off this case.

854
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:31,320
I work every day
and on Saturdays I like to rest.

855
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,400
Then go see him.
I think you should too.

856
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,640
Have Gloria or the social worker
or the social worker.

857
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,960
The best thing would be for you to go
with your lawyer

858
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,320
and two bodyguards.

859
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:52,280
Does your psychologist already let you
your conscience?

860
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,160
Okay, I'll pick you up...
I'll pick you up...

861
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,040
At 11:00?

862
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,600
Okay. See you later.

863
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,880
What's wrong with you and that boy?

864
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,880
Why?
I don't know.

865
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:10,160
You take him out for a snack, you meet up with him
with him on a Saturday morning...

866
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:29,680
Ramón, I am leaving.
Aníbal told me yesterday.

867
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,040
Good luck to you.
Thank you.

868
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:38,680
Goodbye.

869
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,920
-If you need anything, you know.
-Yes.

870
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,880
-Chao, thank you.
-I'd be delighted.

871
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:00,600
I have brought you this book.
I hope you like it.

872
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,720
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. We will surely see each other

873
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,000
at the hospital,
I have to take Hannibal.

874
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:07,600
Well, he didn't tell me anything.

875
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,200
Look there's Marcelo.

876
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:16,960
Is it a gift for Valentine?

877
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:18,920
What is it?
The book.

878
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:21,520
No. This was a gift from Vicente.

879
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:24,560
J.D. Salinger.
The Catcher in the Rye.

880
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:26,200
Alianza editorial.

881
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,520
Have you read it?
I've heard of it. But I haven't.

882
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:38,760
Do you think I should bring him something?

883
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:41,200
Do you want to bring him something?

884
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:07,560
Wait a moment.

885
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,600
Don't worry. Everything is fine.

886
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:34,920
Valentin has been very serious.

887
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:41,600
I know.

888
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:45,680
He says you did it unintentionally.
It's true it was unintentional.

889
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:48,800
Do you know how long he was
on the ground

890
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,520
with no one to help him?

891
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:52,680
Almost an hour.

892
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,320
It's just that I thought I was...

893
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,920
I thought I couldn't do
anything for him.

894
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:04,360
He lost a lot of blood. And he had
an infection that almost died on me.

895
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,400
I just want you to tell me one thing.

896
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,320
I don't want an answer from
your lawyer or my son.

897
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:15,360
I want you to tell me.

898
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:17,680
And looking me in the eyes.

899
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:21,880
Was it a fight?
No, I swear.

900
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:25,440
Can I believe you when you say
that you didn't do it on purpose?

901
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,960
Of course I didn't do it
by the way, Rosa.

902
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:31,640
I have only come
to thank Valentin.

903
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:34,160
And to tell you
that I am very sorry.

904
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:38,160
Come in and talk to him.

905
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,000
What's up, sucker?

906
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,920
How are you?

907
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:45,640
Very bad, but better.

908
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,440
You gave me a great cut, man.

909
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:53,160
I saw it for the first time the other day
in the mirror and I almost fell down.

910
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:55,480
I turned white as a door.

911
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:59,200
My mother can't quite believe
that it was unintentional.

912
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,120
But I would say to her:
"Mom, if you already know Ramon."

913
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,720
Don't laugh, man.
You almost sent me to the other neighborhood.

914
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,120
Good thing you hit me in the neck.

915
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,360
If you hit me
in the face, I'll kill myself.

916
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,160
I could not bear to go

917
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,640
with a cracked face
as if it were a quince.

918
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:20,640
My mother says
you're in a reform school.

919
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,320
Well, it's like a school.

920
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,800
They made such a fuss
that they wanted to get me out of the way.

921
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,480
If I continue well, next week
I can go see Jessi,

922
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,120
who is in maxillofacial.

923
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:35,080
They had to
put a new chin on it.

924
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:40,000
As far as I'm concerned, as long as I still have
the same ass as always...

925
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:49,120
I get so bored that I read
"Interview with the vampire".

926
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,760
And I will leave it because I dream that

927
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:54,720
Tom Cruise comes
and takes a bite out of my neck.

928
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,840
When are you coming home?
I don't know.

929
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,960
They won't let you?
Yes, but I don't know. Do you?

930
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,280
No fucking idea.

931
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,400
Well, I'm off.

932
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:15,240
Get well and thank you, really.

933
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:21,680
What are you doing not thanking me?

934
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,120
I saved you from the slammer.

935
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:33,360
Have you already told them
about Christmas?

936
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,000
I will talk to them on Monday.

937
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,080
Ramón.

938
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:02,800
Are you coming home for lunch?

939
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:11,600
Do you like flan?

940
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,000
A lot.

941
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,320
You are lucky,
there is flan for dessert

942
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,000
and Sara makes them like no one else.

943
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:19,800
Thank you.

944
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,960
I have never seen
a house as beautiful as this one.

945
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,160
Thank you.

946
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,560
You are also from Vallecas, right?
Yes.

947
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:38,440
We have always lived there.

948
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,840
My house is very small,
there is almost no room to move.

949
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,600
But here... It's good that you have
the garden nearby.

950
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:47,440
Yes, it was necessary for the child.

951
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:51,320
When I look out the window, I see the neighbor's living room,
I see the neighbor's living room.

952
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:56,400
Here they are.

953
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,360
Marcelo, why didn't you
you have not put them on plates?

954
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,400
Do you want a plate?
No, I don't.

955
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:07,800
My sister also
likes to make flan a lot

956
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,840
and also complains because
we don't put them on plates.

957
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,560
Neither my mother nor I can wait.
It's the same for me.

958
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,280
And how old is your sister?
29.

959
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:20,920
He will turn 30 in February.

960
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,720
So you knew her, didn't you?
Yes, when I was a child.

961
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,960
My mother showed me the photo
that you have in Luis' bar.

962
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:32,520
Gloria still goes with my mother
every Sunday for lunch.

963
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:36,800
Well, now I don't know.
Because, apparently, it hardly ever comes out.

964
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,760
When I went to your house I stopped by.

965
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,600
It is as usual.
The cockles are delicious.

966
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:47,440
Although I don't know if I'm going to be able
to eat them for a long time.

967
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,120
Hey.

968
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:50,720
What are you doing here?

969
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,000
What are you doing here, huh?

970
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:55,040
Do you also want to?

971
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:56,720
By yourself?

972
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:58,880
Let's see,

973
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:01,400
Coffee, anyone?
Me.

974
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:08,400
Ramon?
No, not me, thank you.

975
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:12,920
And he came back from the kitchen with coffee

976
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,040
and those chocolates
that are so good.

977
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:16,640
This is mind-blowing.

978
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:20,000
When I found it
here on top of it I freaked out.

979
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:27,840
Weren't you this morning
at the hospital with Vicente?

980
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:29,800
Yes, I went to see my doctor.

981
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:35,040
And what did he say?

982
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,720
How nice, as always.

983
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,400
Would you like a puff?

984
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:54,640
In short,
his wife is hot.

985
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:57,640
If that guy wasn't going
be with just anyone.

986
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:53,640
Yes?

987
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,680
-Downs?
-No.

988
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:56,920
Why?

989
01:29:57,940 --> 01:29:59,400
I have been punished by my parents.

990
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,320
I can't hear you, why don't you come down?

991
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:02,800
That I have been punished.

992
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,040
Tell your mother
if she'll let you out for ten minutes.

993
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:07,560
No, it does not.

994
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,520
Then go talk to your father.

995
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:11,720
No, they don't want to. They are very angry.

996
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:14,280
Hi, Carmen, how are you?

997
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,880
I left my keys behind
and my parents are not here.

998
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,000
Don't worry.

999
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:24,120
Would you like to have a drink?

1000
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:29,040
-Come on, give me a coffee with milk.
-Hi, Carmen, how are you doing?

1001
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,640
-Well, how are you doing?
-Very well, as always.

1002
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:49,800
What a surprise.

1003
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:51,760
I came to see you, but no one was there.

1004
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,080
Is something wrong?
No, no.

1005
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,680
I wanted to tell you
about Ramon's Christmas.

1006
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,840
Do you know he was with Valentin?

1007
01:30:58,360 --> 01:30:59,240
Yes, he told me yesterday.

1008
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,000
He also said that
he had eaten at your house.

1009
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:03,800
(LAUGHS) Yes.
He was very happy.

1010
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:06,240
Would you like to have a drink?
Sure.

1011
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:07,840
Hello.
Hello.

1012
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,120
Hello, what's up?
Luis, give me a cane.

1013
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:11,880
Do you know who it is?

1014
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:14,760
The fact is that before
when he entered

1015
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,000
his face has rang a bell,
but I don't get it.

1016
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,400
Román's son.

1017
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,680
The mother who bore me.

1018
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:24,560
(LAUGHS) Román's son. Sole, look
who is here,

1019
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:25,640
Román's son.

1020
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:29,040
Marcelo? Yes, I was just saying
I thought I knew his face.

1021
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,280
That's why I've been watching you.

1022
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:34,000
Maybe you thought
I wanted to flirt with you.

1023
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,080
You are as handsome as your father.

1024
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,360
It's been a long time
since you've been here, hasn't it?

1025
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:42,080
Maybe you were annoyed
that I told you...

1026
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:43,800
No, not at all, don't worry.

1027
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,720
I just knew he was going to be happy.

1028
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,240
He remembers a lot
of our parents.

1029
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,320
Something like that will never
ever happen to me.

1030
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,960
As I have not left here.
It's already happened to you.

1031
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,280
When?

1032
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:58,040
When I saw you
in your house for the first time.

1033
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,960
I told you that on the street
I wouldn't have recognized you.

1034
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:02,760
(LAUGHTER) It's true.

1035
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:06,400
I still remembered you as a child.

1036
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:09,520
The last time we
last time we saw each other we were very young.

1037
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:12,480
Last time
you had just started college.

1038
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,720
What do you say?
Yes.

1039
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,040
We went for an aperitif
at your parents' house.

1040
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:19,680
It was hot, don't you remember?

1041
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:21,680
No.

1042
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,080
That was the day that I
my first long skirt.

1043
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:26,680
Of flowers.

1044
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:32,080
And a blouse that left me
all my back in the air.

1045
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:34,760
My father didn't want me
to wear it,

1046
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:36,120
but I got stubborn.

1047
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:38,640
He was very strict.

1048
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,200
Although with me
always ended up giving in.

1049
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:45,640
You showed me
your record collection.

1050
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:49,240
I have never seen
so many records together in my life.

1051
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:50,920
You were very fond of music.

1052
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,440
I remember

1053
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:58,200
that I thought you were taking me
to your room to entertain me.

1054
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:02,000
Like when
when we were kids we used to come to this bar

1055
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,600
and on the way
you held my hand

1056
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:07,800
while our parents
chatted without paying any attention to us.

1057
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:11,480
That was the last time.

1058
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,240
And then Barcelona.

1059
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:20,520
Lawyer.

1060
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:23,800
You got what you wanted, didn't you?

1061
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:28,440
On the other hand, I have let myself go

1062
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:32,640
and the days have gone by
days and days.

1063
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:34,440
Gloria.

1064
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,080
And now we are here again,

1065
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:40,880
in this bar.

1066
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:18,160
How did you get it?

1067
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:22,160
But, Marcelo,
I've told you a thousand times.

1068
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:25,400
So tell me one more time.

1069
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:27,080
Good.

1070
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,160
Summer, on the beach,
I was still nine years old.

1071
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:39,400
My mother sent my brothers
to buy a bottle of soda.

1072
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:41,960
But they sent me.

1073
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:45,080
That's why you were the little one.
That's why I was the little one.

1074
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:48,440
And as I ran back
with the bottle, I fell.

1075
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:50,120
And what did your mother tell you?

1076
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:52,400
He scolded me for running.

1077
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:54,800
What mothers are like.

1078
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:02,720
Have you noticed that
scars can be read?

1079
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:03,800
Like a book.

1080
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:08,240
You got this one when you fell
off a fence.

1081
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:09,520
Yes.

1082
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,040
Do you see how I do remember
everything you tell me?

1083
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:22,160
You had never told me
about Ramon's sister.

1084
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:24,960
Gloria?
Yes.

1085
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,560
Well, I don't know her very well.

1086
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:31,840
I had almost forgotten it.

1087
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:35,480
Until he called me
by phone to the office

1088
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,840
for me to
to take care of his brother.

1089
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,000
Do you miss
having some family?

1090
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,520
No, that's nonsense.

1091
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:50,520
Besides,
these things cannot be invented.

1092
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,880
I just don't have it.

1093
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:59,520
The other day I asked you
a question and you didn't answer me.

1094
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:01,600
Which one?

1095
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,080
What's wrong with Ramón?

1096
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:08,400
I have never seen you
so interested in anyone's life.

1097
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,280
I don't know, you're usually colder.

1098
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:14,160
I am not cold to you.
No.

1099
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:15,920
No, not even with the child.

1100
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:20,120
It's with the rest, you don't get involved
in people's lives.

1101
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:23,200
In Barcelona, for example.

1102
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:25,840
You had coworkers,
customers

1103
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:28,200
of those of whom you have been
affairs for years

1104
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:30,600
and you never got
intimate with them.

1105
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:34,760
This is the first time
you are interested in character.

1106
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:37,600
Don't say that.

1107
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:40,040
This is not the first time.

1108
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,200
Everything that
there was before I met you,

1109
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,800
I can't help but feel
it was another life.

1110
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:56,120
I never had any attachment to my neighborhood.

1111
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:59,000
We lived in a corrala,
Do you know what that is?

1112
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:03,400
The neighbors knew what
were cooking in the house next door

1113
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,840
because the smell
was getting everywhere.

1114
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:07,040
And not just the smell.

1115
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:12,080
Some recount their childhood memories
of their childhood with a smile,

1116
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,400
well, as far as I'm concerned, let them stay
in childhood and never come back.

1117
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,400
All those Sundays in the neighborhood,
studying in a room

1118
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,640
from which I heard
my parents' TV,

1119
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,600
the neighbor's radio,
the shouts from upstairs.

1120
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:30,520
I didn't want a life like that,

1121
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,240
I didn't want a life
like my parents'.

1122
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:37,320
Every thing I did, every step I took
I took was to get away from there.

1123
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:39,920
When my mother died,

1124
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,180
my father
did not want to leave the house.

1125
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,120
During his last two years,
we hardly saw each other.

1126
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:48,960
He did not want to leave Madrid

1127
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,760
and I didn't like
to go back to the neighborhood.

1128
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:53,760
So he died alone.

1129
01:37:56,820 --> 01:38:00,160
Then I realized that,
with him, I was losing all my past.

1130
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:03,560
And then I met you.

1131
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,280
Payment?

1132
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:24,160
In a house, in a street
can be a whole life.

1133
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:26,120
I don't have any of that.

1134
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,720
What little my parents had
disappeared with them.

1135
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:33,600
There is no one who was with me
with me during my childhood.

1136
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:35,960
And it is so difficult
to recount a memory.

1137
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:13,040
(Melancholic music)

1138
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:57,400
Vicente.
What's up?

1139
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:01,000
I wanted to ask you a question.

1140
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:06,800
Yeah, man, don't be such a pain.
Just like a dog.

1141
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:10,280
I have already told you that
you can't smoke.

1142
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,880
It's not that,
it's whether you're going to stay or not.

1143
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:15,720
Let's see, what day is today?
December 15th.

1144
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,800
It seems to me that
Christmas Eve is a long way off.

1145
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:23,300
As soon as you get careless, the day comes
and I wanted to know what you are going to do.

1146
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:24,920
What are you going to do?

1147
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:28,000
What do you care?
I do care.

1148
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:31,620
I have to get used to the idea
to the idea in case you don't stay.

1149
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:37,200
You're going with your mother, aren't you?

1150
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:39,300
No, I'm staying.

1151
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:41,480
So there are more of us.

1152
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,040
Better,
the more we are the more we laugh.

1153
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:45,720
That one is an asshole.

1154
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:48,480
And what are you doing tonight?

1155
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,640
Let's go to Barcelona.
What about New Year's Eve?

1156
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:53,520
On New Year's Eve
Sara's parents will come to see us.

1157
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,960
Gloria Fortuna
wants to talk to you.

1158
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:59,640
Put the call through to my office.
He's not on the phone, he's here.

1159
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,480
It seems that they already dared
to testify in favor of Ramón.

1160
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:07,480
When the prosecutor passes the report
we will talk to the judge.

1161
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,880
And if it goes well after Christmas

1162
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,520
it will all be over,
we have been very lucky.

1163
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:15,880
Ramón does not want to return home.

1164
01:41:16,980 --> 01:41:18,160
Well, I told you

1165
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:21,080
that he was going to stay
this Christmas at the center.

1166
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:22,800
He has made a good friend there.

1167
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:26,080
Ramón is stronger
than he looks

1168
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:29,600
and it's holding up
much better than we thought.

1169
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:32,560
It's just that Ramón
doesn't want to go home anymore.

1170
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:36,240
What nonsense, did he tell you?
He didn't tell me anything, but I know.

1171
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:38,240
I know this better than anyone.

1172
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:41,280
Well, at 15 years old,
you tell me where he's going to go.

1173
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,760
There is no reason
for it to remain there.

1174
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:45,960
For Ramón this
has changed his life.

1175
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:48,080
But, woman, don't exaggerate, for God's sake.

1176
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:51,800
Ramón will return home
and they will look at him with curiosity.

1177
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,800
But in time, everything will pass.

1178
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:58,480
He went downtown for a few days
and has been here for a month and a half.

1179
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:12,160
This is Ramon's
Ramon's birth certificate.

1180
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:43,280
I got pregnant when I was 14 years old,

1181
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:49,200
my parents took me out of the house.
They got an apartment in Tetuan,

1182
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:52,600
so that no one
in the neighborhood would see me.

1183
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:57,560
When I came back, the baby came
home in my mother's arms.

1184
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:03,920
I thought the neighbors would know
the truth from the beginning.

1185
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:08,480
This lie
has been growing day by day.

1186
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:13,480
I have been living with her for 15 years.

1187
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,480
And now, what are you going to do?

1188
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:33,400
Having the courage to be his mother.

1189
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:37,160
I don't want him to return
to a place that was not his home.

1190
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:39,920
I will find a way
for him to live in another neighborhood.

1191
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:44,760
I don't care if my mother bangs her
banging her head against the walls.

1192
01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:46,720
She did not decide about my life.

1193
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:49,880
I will decide about my child's.

1194
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,120
I don't know what to say.

1195
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:02,960
But I think that
if you want to tell Ramon,

1196
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:06,920
maybe the best thing to do is to
wait until after Christmas.

1197
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:08,480
To having arrived home

1198
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,360
and for all of you to be
a little calmer.

1199
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,400
I guess I don't have to tell you
to tell you, but...

1200
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:20,480
is going to be a difficult situation.

1201
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:25,200
If you need help,
you can count on me.

1202
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:30,440
I'm glad to have found you
you again,

1203
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,080
even if it was for this.

1204
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:35,680
You have behaved
like a true friend.

1205
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:45,400
But, well, what happened to you
in your heads?

1206
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:53,640
No, no, you look very handsome,
really, huh?

1207
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:58,040
Very funny. You look
just as ugly as you are every day.

1208
01:44:58,560 --> 01:44:59,480
(LAUGHING)

1209
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:01,760
Well, kids, today
because it's Christmas Eve,

1210
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:03,520
we have a special menu.

1211
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:06,240
We would prefer that you do not end up
too light.

1212
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:09,600
The hors d'oeuvre cannot be used
as throwing weapons

1213
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:14,000
let alone the three prawns
that are going to be on each plate, OK?

1214
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:16,600
Well, enjoy your dinner.

1215
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:19,200
I hope that next year
you have abandoned this

1216
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:22,920
and we can go
with our girlfriends.

1217
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:29,440
Enjoy.

1218
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:32,920
Hand me a piece of nougat.

1219
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,120
-Take it.
-Thank you.

1220
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:45,960
Let Chino tell
about Portugal

1221
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:48,600
-I still don't know it.
-No, not again.

1222
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:51,200
Then let Ramón
tell about the dead.

1223
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:53,840
Antonio, don't be too smart.

1224
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:58,280
We always have to be
always have to be talking and he shuts up.

1225
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,400
Well, if you tell your stuff
it's because you feel like it.

1226
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:04,920
I'll tell you again:
let's have the party in peace.

1227
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:13,240
Did you know that next quarter
they are going to open a new workshop school

1228
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:16,240
and that whoever studies there
will be able to live in the apartments

1229
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:18,840
that they have built next door?
-And what is being studied?

1230
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:21,600
A lot of things:
computers, electronics...

1231
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:24,080
carving and wood, bookbinding.

1232
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,840
Abel, what do you have in mind
for next year?

1233
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:29,320
Well...
I'm going to keep training.

1234
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:34,400
And, when I'm ready, I'm going to ask the cop's manager
the cop's manager for proof.

1235
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:37,120
I talked to a guy who works
at El Velero

1236
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:39,920
and he told me that the cop's manager
the cop's manager goes by

1237
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,880
and that since he is no longer
or to hit his mother...

1238
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:46,040
who is looking for a kid
to represent.

1239
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,760
I have given the bar staff
the center's phone number

1240
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:51,280
and I have been promised
that if the manager comes back,

1241
01:46:51,860 --> 01:46:52,520
that they are going to give it to him.

1242
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,480
I don't like boxing,
but if you fight, I'll go.

1243
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,960
When I get out of here
I'm going to my grandmother's

1244
01:46:58,480 --> 01:46:59,960
to the charcuterie
in Cuenca.

1245
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:02,440
-Wasn't it a butcher shop?
-No, a deli.

1246
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,000
You told me a butcher shop.

1247
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:06,840
As you say
that my grandmother is a butcher,

1248
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:08,360
I'll cut your balls off.
-Hey.

1249
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,400
I still have to clean
the school for a year.

1250
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:13,880
So next time,
you think about it,

1251
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:15,880
before destroying three classes.

1252
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,120
That's not something that everyone is
to everyone.

1253
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:21,600
Javier broke I don't know how many booths
and has not had to pay.

1254
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:23,960
You are going to be an example
for all of Spain.

1255
01:47:24,820 --> 01:47:26,720
As I seem to be doing well in this course,

1256
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:30,040
I'm going to see if I can take a course
of these librarian courses

1257
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:31,360
or some other move.

1258
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:34,360
I'm going to set up a tavern
with Francis.

1259
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:35,680
A little joint in Entrevías

1260
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,080
with a colleague
who is now of legal age.

1261
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:40,440
We work hard
and then we give him the dough.

1262
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,360
And we cheated you on the accounts.

1263
01:47:58,860 --> 01:48:01,200
I don't think I'm going back
to high school this year.

1264
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:04,160
I don't know, the truth is that I haven't
I haven't thought about it yet.

1265
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:07,880
You are staying here with me
until next year.

1266
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:11,760
Be careful, kid, this one
he'll give you some of what he's got.

1267
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,560
What's the matter? I didn't say anything.

1268
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:24,920
The only thing I have told you
is to be careful.

1269
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:27,840
Ask for forgiveness.

1270
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:30,160
Who, Ramón?

1271
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:32,920
Don't be too smart,
ask Hannibal for forgiveness.

1272
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:34,880
Fuck this kid...

1273
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:38,600
on top of the fact that whenever he is taking
takes out a cigarette paper...

1274
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:41,520
And I am always by his side,
as if nothing had happened.

1275
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:42,800
Ask for forgiveness!

1276
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:51,200
Ask for forgiveness.

1277
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:57,960
Ask for forgiveness!

1278
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:01,440
That it doesn't matter, really,
that it doesn't matter.

1279
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:04,120
Fuck, Vicente,

1280
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:06,600
if I haven't said anything.

1281
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:09,640
Go ahead, ask for forgiveness.

1282
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:12,160
If I only said that...

1283
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:13,880
Go to your room, you cunt!

1284
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:24,520
I hope you die next year.

1285
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:31,760
Let him go, Ramon.
Let him go, please.

1286
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,880
It almost killed me. It almost killed me, I swear.

1287
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:47,400
(Door)

1288
01:49:57,860 --> 01:49:58,800
Ten.

1289
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:01,400
Take this and lie down.

1290
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:55,960
Yesterday was great.

1291
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:59,800
I've been dreaming for a year
of someone doing that to him.

1292
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:03,000
As long as you're here, he won't dare
to mess with me,

1293
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:07,160
but when you leave...
I still don't know what I'm going to do.

1294
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:11,200
You went berserk.
Even Silvester was freaking out.

1295
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:14,440
And the guy starts:
"It kills me, it kills me."

1296
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:23,240
Don't you care that I'm sick?
that I'm sick?

1297
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:24,960
Me? Of course not, man.

1298
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:28,320
And do you know what I'm sick of?

1299
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:29,720
Yes.

1300
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:33,200
The doctor says that they no longer die
as they used to,

1301
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:36,360
that it is no longer the same.
Of course it is not the same.

1302
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:39,840
Well, my father knows it too
and he hasn't come to see me.

1303
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:45,480
Come on, man, we're late.

1304
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:49,880
Look, man.

1305
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:51,840
Fuck.

1306
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:56,640
The one that is rare is Vicente.
When he seems to be on your side,

1307
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:59,600
the guy who goes and takes the other guy's side.
the other guy's side.

1308
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:02,800
He told me that Chino deserved
more compassion than me.

1309
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:04,040
Let's go. That bully.

1310
01:52:21,460 --> 01:52:23,360
What, are you improved or not?

1311
01:52:32,060 --> 01:52:33,720
What the hell is wrong with you now?

1312
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:03,480
I've never been
to a Chinese restaurant, you know?

1313
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,680
Well, the truth is that I've never
been to a restaurant.

1314
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:08,200
To bars, yes, to many.

1315
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:12,480
In the end, we always end up
eating some tapas in a bar.

1316
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:17,000
We have to transfer here.

1317
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:20,960
When we lived with grandma
it was different,

1318
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:22,760
we always ate at home.

1319
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:25,160
But when he died,

1320
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:28,120
my brother Lexis and I
went back to my parents.

1321
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:43,240
Last Christmas
we spent in a bar.

1322
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:06,360
We were my parents,
my brother Lexis and me.

1323
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:10,240
My parents told us
that we could ask for

1324
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:11,920
of everything we would like.

1325
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:15,320
After a while, they told us that they had to leave for a moment.
they had to leave for a moment,

1326
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:18,640
but that they would be right back,
that we would wait there.

1327
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:22,680
But when people left,
my parents didn't arrive.

1328
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:25,480
We were there, waiting.

1329
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:28,000
I didn't know what to do.

1330
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:31,600
The owner of the bar
gave us Coca-Colas

1331
01:54:32,140 --> 01:54:33,280
and some tortilla skewers.

1332
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:36,320
We were there for at least two more hours,
two more hours,

1333
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:39,640
while those at the bar
finished eating.

1334
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:42,240
I watched a whole movie on TV,

1335
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:45,240
one of a slave who does not want
to be a gladiator

1336
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:47,160
and rebels against the Romans.

1337
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:49,000
It was very long.

1338
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:54,640
In the end, the bar owner
called the police

1339
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:58,240
and that night they took us
to a place to sleep.

1340
01:54:58,760 --> 01:54:59,840
And then to a residence.

1341
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:03,480
I haven't seen Ulises for three years
I haven't seen him,

1342
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:05,880
because some gentlemen adopted him.

1343
01:55:07,540 --> 01:55:11,080
When my parents came
I lived with them for two years.

1344
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:17,040
All that time, I don't know what I did.
Waiting.

1345
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:22,680
When my parents showed up, it was
to put on and go to sleep right away.

1346
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:24,800
In the end, not to be alone,

1347
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:27,640
I ended up accompanying them
to catch them in the village,

1348
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:32,120
and one day when my father was ill, he
sick, he sent me.

1349
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:36,640
When I had already bought it
and was on my way home,

1350
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:38,560
The police showed up and caught me.

1351
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:41,760
They asked me about my parents,

1352
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:45,080
but I have never snitched
and I didn't say anything.

1353
01:55:47,180 --> 01:55:49,720
My mother appeared from time to time
in the center,

1354
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:53,600
but he hasn't been here for a long time.
I haven't seen my father since.

1355
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:56,280
I thought that if Ulysses
is still with that family

1356
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:59,580
maybe one day she'll come looking for me.
That's my sister.

1357
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:10,800
Hello.

1358
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:13,640
This is my friend Aníbal.
Hello, Hannibal.

1359
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:24,600
Bring it here, child.

1360
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:28,360
Don't get a cold in your throat
and get sick.

1361
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:29,640
This is impossible.

1362
01:56:30,220 --> 01:56:32,120
I'm checked by the doctor twice a month
a month

1363
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:34,400
and tells me
that I am getting stronger every day.

1364
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:38,600
Twice a month? That's a lot of crap.
They do take good care of you, yes.

1365
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:40,960
And I just got new teeth.
new teeth.

1366
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:42,680
And look how I have them, look.

1367
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:47,880
It's great that you're so happy with your
so happy with your teeth,

1368
01:56:48,440 --> 01:56:50,040
that you don't know what a nuisance they are.

1369
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:53,680
I used to have a hole here in the middle,

1370
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:56,840
but Vicente managed
to fix it for me.

1371
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:58,720
He also had a bad ear.

1372
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:02,840
What have you not gone through, child?

1373
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:08,520
What have you done to your hair?

1374
01:57:09,680 --> 01:57:12,520
Well, I've put on some hair gel.
You look very handsome.

1375
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:14,920
And you too.

1376
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:36,640
Do you want to show Hannibal
where you live?

1377
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:40,520
It's just a moment.
And then you can do whatever you want.

1378
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:41,680
Of course it is.

1379
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,880
And you have to take the box
with the photos for Marcelo,

1380
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:46,840
who will stop by the school tomorrow

1381
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:49,440
and I promised him
that I would have them ready for him.

1382
01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:52,040
Come on, let's go.

1383
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:02,320
Look, I live very comfortably
in this street,

1384
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:05,160
but if it had trees,
I would like it a lot more.

1385
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:13,120
And where is your house?
It is right here.

1386
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:19,080
-Hello, how are you?
-Hello.

1387
01:58:20,020 --> 01:58:22,520
-What? Is the boy coming back already?
-Yes, in no time.

1388
01:58:23,060 --> 01:58:25,520
Let's see how you behave,
your mother is very sorry for you.

1389
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:27,960
How are you going to behave?
Well, as usual.

1390
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:29,240
Woman, that's an understatement.

1391
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:32,120
I lived with my parents
in a boarding house.

1392
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:34,960
That's good, so your mother
didn't have to clean up.

1393
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:37,960
She wasn't around much.
Neither was my father.

1394
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:41,360
Most of the time we spent most of the time
my brother and I alone.

1395
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:43,880
And why were you left alone?
Too much work?

1396
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:46,360
Yes.
Have you seen how hot it is?

1397
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:49,120
Sit there on the couch
and put whatever you want.

1398
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:52,720
Gloria, cut some nougat for the kids.
for the kids.

1399
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:57,040
With everything that has happened, this year
we haven't even split it yet.

1400
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:00,640
Christmas is going by
that we are not even aware of it.

1401
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:03,200
Let's see if next year
things get better,

1402
01:59:03,740 --> 01:59:05,760
because this is no life.
Mom, don't start.

1403
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:06,920
Can you help me?

1404
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:10,800
I don't say anything anymore. Every time
I say something, you tell me to shut up.

1405
01:59:11,320 --> 01:59:12,520
I don't know what I have done

1406
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:14,760
4The other day I went to high school.

1407
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:18,920
The director told me that
January 8 you can come back.

1408
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:21,000
If you feel like it.

1409
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:23,640
It's just that everyone
is going to ask me.

1410
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:25,720
But we can look for another solution.

1411
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:29,960
I don't mind if you lose a course.
You can spend it on other things.

1412
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:33,040
I'll have to know what mom says first, won't I?
what mom says, right?

1413
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:34,720
Mom has to be given it done.

1414
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:37,640
To dwell on it will only complicate things
will only complicate things.

1415
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:39,920
He would start wailing,
and cry and...

1416
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:41,720
I can't stand it anymore.

1417
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:50,000
If it's okay with you, I'll come see you
next week and we'll talk.

1418
01:59:51,020 --> 01:59:53,520
I went to the institute
to prepare the ground for you,

1419
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:54,920
in case you wanted to come back.

1420
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:58,600
You can really do
whatever you want, Ramón.

1421
01:59:59,220 --> 02:00:02,600
You should not stay there any longer
there, you are not a delinquent.

1422
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:05,040
Neither does Hannibal.
But Hannibal has no family.

1423
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:06,880
It has nothing,
don't compare yourself.

1424
02:00:11,020 --> 02:00:12,600
Why don't you go to the movies?

1425
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:16,160
They show an adventure movie
that they say is very good.

1426
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:17,680
Take money from my purse.

1427
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:21,240
The one with the beard married last year
with one of the TV news,

1428
02:00:21,780 --> 02:00:23,480
but he at night
and she in the morning

1429
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,240
and that marriage will never be seen.
So they don't fight.

1430
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:29,640
(LAUGHTER) Well, you're right too.

1431
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:51,120
(Melancholic music)

1432
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:38,120
And Ramon?
Hello.

1433
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:40,560
Good afternoon.

1434
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:43,520
Where is Ramón?
Ramón is sick, with the flu.

1435
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:45,960
He told me to come
here to wait for him

1436
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:49,840
and I've been there for three quarters of an hour.
Well, I'm going to your room.

1437
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:55,720
Better not.

1438
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:58,200
He told me
that his head hurts a lot

1439
02:01:58,740 --> 02:02:01,480
and says he doesn't want to talk
to anyone. He knows what Ramón is like,

1440
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
when he says he doesn't talk,
is that he does not speak.

1441
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:05,800
It was for him.

1442
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:08,360
You can share it.
Shall I open it now?

1443
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:10,160
No, in your room.

1444
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:12,640
And tell Ramon
that when he feels better

1445
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:15,600
to call me.
Ramon gave me this for you.

1446
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:18,600
He told me, when I see him,
to call him.

1447
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:21,960
And I say it to you.
I do what I am told.

1448
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:17,600
(Melancholic music)

1449
02:03:59,980 --> 02:04:01,800
I came across this by chance.

1450
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:05,000
"I just want to know if it's true
and if you knew it."

1451
02:04:05,580 --> 02:04:08,840
"I'll be all afternoon
waiting for your call. Ramon."

1452
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:10,960
And he didn't tell you anything else?

1453
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:13,320
Yes, to call him.

1454
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:19,320
That sweater is old, isn't it?

1455
02:04:24,140 --> 02:04:26,480
If someday you want my cap.
I'll leave it with you.

1456
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:29,800
Isn't it fucking great?

1457
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:55,400
Who is my father?

1458
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:06,600
I can't tell you.

1459
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:09,400
I have a right to know, don't I?
That I can't.

1460
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:11,440
What difference does it make. I never saw him again.

1461
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:12,640
He was not my boyfriend.

1462
02:05:13,180 --> 02:05:14,760
Ramón, I was only 14 years old.

1463
02:05:15,320 --> 02:05:16,520
I just want to know a name.

1464
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:18,240
To know how you knew him.

1465
02:05:21,980 --> 02:05:23,440
Please tell me who it was.

1466
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:44,400
One night, my friend Luisa and I

1467
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:46,640
we went out with three guys
from high school.

1468
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:50,640
First we went to La isla bar
to have a few beers

1469
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:54,440
and when we were all loaded up, we went to the park,
we went to the park.

1470
02:05:55,660 --> 02:05:57,360
There we smoked a few joints.

1471
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:01,120
I liked one of the boys,

1472
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:03,960
but I started with another one.

1473
02:06:06,020 --> 02:06:07,960
Then I went on to the one I liked.

1474
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:13,000
Shall I tell you that I did it with all three?

1475
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:17,280
Well, I can't tell you,

1476
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:19,400
because I don't remember.

1477
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:23,800
I do not remember

1478
02:06:27,380 --> 02:06:28,440
and I have no regrets.

1479
02:06:30,340 --> 02:06:33,440
How can I regret something that happened
that happened 16 years ago?

1480
02:06:37,240 --> 02:06:39,240
I just want you to know that I would never,

1481
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:43,480
I never thought that you could
have killed anyone.

1482
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:44,720
At the worst moment.

1483
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:47,880
When we came back from the movies
and everybody was talking about you,

1484
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,320
as of someone
who had gone mad.

1485
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:56,000
So I ask you not to think
that I was a whore.

1486
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:57,280
Because it wasn't.

1487
02:06:59,660 --> 02:07:01,880
There are so many things
that are done at that age

1488
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:03,760
without thinking about the consequences.

1489
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:10,840
I have never wanted to talk
to anyone about all this.

1490
02:07:13,700 --> 02:07:16,800
I don't know how you will feel
not knowing who your father is,

1491
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:19,480
but I only feel shame.

1492
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:27,760
Ramón,

1493
02:07:28,940 --> 02:07:31,400
you have to learn
to understand and forgive.

1494
02:07:32,220 --> 02:07:34,640
And you can't say
that you lacked affection,

1495
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:36,120
because you've got some left over.

1496
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:06,240
Son,

1497
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:09,120
son,

1498
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:12,360
I know you are angry with me.

1499
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:13,480
I am not your son.

1500
02:08:14,860 --> 02:08:17,160
But that doesn't change the affection
I had for you.

1501
02:08:22,060 --> 02:08:23,880
Why didn't you tell me this before?

1502
02:08:24,420 --> 02:08:26,200
You've been fooling me for a long time.

1503
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:28,040
But you wouldn't have believed me.

1504
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:32,160
You would have been angry
and you wouldn't have let me come back.

1505
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:33,360
Don't talk nonsense.

1506
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:36,120
You can't get angry
with a dead man.

1507
02:08:39,420 --> 02:08:41,480
If you want me to leave
forever.

1508
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:43,920
I can no longer change anything.

1509
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:47,640
We dead people can't fix our mistakes
our mistakes.

1510
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:53,880
And what shall I call you
from now on?

1511
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:56,320
I don't want to call you dad
like I used to.

1512
02:08:57,700 --> 02:08:59,760
Well, Grandpa, I don't want you to call me.

1513
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:02,120
And I don't like my name either.

1514
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:05,320
Your mother insisted on putting it
in the niche and I didn't like it.

1515
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:08,520
Call me Fortuna.

1516
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:11,400
Fortuna?

1517
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,680
You were the best son
a father could ever wish for.

1518
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:37,280
I have a belly like a drum.

1519
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:39,440
I can't sleep either.

1520
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:42,080
Well, we are off to a good start this year.

1521
02:09:46,680 --> 02:09:48,000
No, man, no, please.

1522
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:50,760
Well, this relaxes me.

1523
02:09:51,460 --> 02:09:53,640
You lie down like this, on your back

1524
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:55,760
and it's as if you were
in the countryside.

1525
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:00,320
Do not open the window.

1526
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:03,280
Hey, are you going to sign up for the
to the school-workshop?

1527
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:04,360
What about you?

1528
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:05,520
I guess so.

1529
02:10:06,120 --> 02:10:08,360
We'll have to get out of here sometime, won't we?
have to get out of here, don't we?

1530
02:10:08,900 --> 02:10:09,480
Already.

1531
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,520
The thing is that I don't know
if I want to leave so soon.

1532
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:14,680
I'm sure Vicente
misses me.

1533
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:17,440
And, what does your family say?

1534
02:10:18,780 --> 02:10:20,200
Well, they still don't know,

1535
02:10:20,720 --> 02:10:22,240
but I don't think they think it's wrong.

1536
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:25,880
Anyway, since it's fine with me, I'll do it.
it's fine with me, I'm going to do it.

1537
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:27,640
Well, if you are so sure.

1538
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:30,000
Of course. You have three months
to decide

1539
02:10:30,540 --> 02:10:33,600
and when we are there, we can
continue to live together in the apartment.

1540
02:10:34,120 --> 02:10:35,000
And what can I do?

1541
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:37,640
I don't know, any of
of those things that Vicente said.

1542
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:40,320
Computers, wood carving,
bookbinding...

1543
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:43,240
Look, and this way you can fix the book
that you broke.

1544
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:45,420
I have never read
a book in my life.

1545
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:47,860
You don't have to read it
if you don't want to.

1546
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:43,560
Hello, did you find the street well?
Yes.

1547
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,680
Jaime, do you remember Ramón?

1548
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:48,680
But how great you are!

1549
02:11:49,240 --> 02:11:50,520
We were watering. Come in, come in.

1550
02:11:59,540 --> 02:12:02,760
They are going to make a report
for television about the workshop.

1551
02:12:03,560 --> 02:12:06,280
Vicente called me and told me
that I should not go out.

1552
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:08,320
Because I am not very representative.

1553
02:12:11,200 --> 02:12:13,080
I'm not a waif
and all that.

1554
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:15,400
But of course...
Nobody knows the truth.

1555
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:22,360
And what are you going to do in the end?
I'm committed and I'm going out.

1556
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:26,160
They say that we won't be able to see well
and our face will be blurry.

1557
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:28,920
Do you want to go out?
Me? Why?

1558
02:12:29,460 --> 02:12:30,120
How you helped me.

1559
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:31,800
But I didn't do anything.

1560
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:34,360
Besides, my thing
not about chorizo.

1561
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:37,680
I help the fat cats
not to pay taxes.

1562
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:43,200
(Phone)

1563
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:46,440
This is the sweater you gave me.

1564
02:12:46,980 --> 02:12:49,120
And you've been wearing
with the label on?

1565
02:12:49,740 --> 02:12:53,080
The truth is that I haven't had
many opportunities to wear it.

1566
02:12:53,900 --> 02:12:55,520
But it's very nice. It really is.

1567
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:03,360
I would like to invite you to dinner,

1568
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:07,200
but we are going out with some of Sara's friends
Sara's friends who are coming from Barcelona.

1569
02:13:07,720 --> 02:13:08,400
It doesn't matter.

1570
02:13:09,020 --> 02:13:11,920
Sorry. It was Begoña,
who can't stay with the child.

1571
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:13,520
You go. I'll stay with him.

1572
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:14,880
No. Alone I don't feel like it.

1573
02:13:15,400 --> 02:13:16,880
If you want, I can stay.

1574
02:13:18,020 --> 02:13:21,080
You tell me what to do
and I wait until you come.

1575
02:13:21,600 --> 02:13:22,520
It's a good idea, isn't it?

1576
02:13:23,860 --> 02:13:25,280
Can you come here for a moment?

1577
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:31,920
Come! Where are you going?

1578
02:13:40,380 --> 02:13:41,320
What's up?

1579
02:13:42,420 --> 02:13:44,760
Do you think it's a good idea
to leave the child with Ramón?

1580
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:47,200
Yes, they do, don't they?
I'm sure they get along well.

1581
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:49,720
In addition, Ramón is very affectionate.

1582
02:13:50,420 --> 02:13:53,640
Do you think I'm crazy enough
to leave my son in the hands

1583
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:56,080
of a child
I don't know what's in his head?

1584
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:04,280
You told me I should trust him.
trust him. Don't you remember?

1585
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:05,980
We are not going to argue about that.

1586
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:08,240
If you don't want him to stay
it doesn't stay.

1587
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:10,160
But the kid is not crazy.

1588
02:14:10,700 --> 02:14:12,520
What interest do you have
in continuing with this?

1589
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:15,520
You have already done everything you could
for him and his family.

1590
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:18,560
They are the only thing
I have left from my past.

1591
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:22,280
With them I have the opportunity
to get it back

1592
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:23,560
and I'm going to take advantage of it.

1593
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:26,120
But what past do you
do you want to recover, Marcelo?

1594
02:14:28,100 --> 02:14:29,040
It's just that...

1595
02:14:30,080 --> 02:14:31,400
It's hard for me to talk about it.

1596
02:14:32,620 --> 02:14:33,560
It makes me sad.

1597
02:14:35,060 --> 02:14:37,680
It makes you sad
because you don't talk about it with anyone.

1598
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:40,640
And the one who feels it is me
who am here with you.

1599
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:47,480
Do you love me?

1600
02:14:50,240 --> 02:14:51,440
What's that all about now?

1601
02:14:52,120 --> 02:14:54,480
No, really. Do you love me?

1602
02:14:56,640 --> 02:14:59,560
I have the feeling that
you are with me because I take care of you.

1603
02:15:00,120 --> 02:15:01,040
Because I am here.

1604
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:03,640
For what I love you.

1605
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:08,040
Please, this is absurd.

1606
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:11,500
Of course I love you.

1607
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:15,060
Sara...

1608
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:03,040
Sara is very fearful
with the child.

1609
02:16:03,580 --> 02:16:05,420
He has had very high fevers and...

1610
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:06,640
It's all right.

1611
02:16:07,980 --> 02:16:09,700
I'm going to leave.
Stay a little longer.

1612
02:16:11,860 --> 02:16:13,420
I heard some of what he was saying.

1613
02:16:14,600 --> 02:16:15,580
Don't think that...

1614
02:16:16,040 --> 02:16:17,280
No. If I understand it...

1615
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,500
There is something I want to tell you.

1616
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:30,520
I lied to you when I told you
how things had happened.

1617
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:32,780
I killed Gordo.

1618
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:36,320
He had me by the neck

1619
02:16:36,900 --> 02:16:38,760
and only let me go
when I kicked him.

1620
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:43,760
He stood cowering on the stairs.
And he looked at me.

1621
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:47,320
I realized
that I was waiting

1622
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:48,880
to grab me again.

1623
02:16:49,900 --> 02:16:51,800
So I gave it another kick
and he fell down.

1624
02:16:54,480 --> 02:16:58,280
I think there is no difference
between having kicked him or not

1625
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:00,400
because it was going
was going to fall.

1626
02:17:01,860 --> 02:17:02,920
But there is.

1627
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:05,840
And the fact is that since then

1628
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:08,840
I have not been able to stop thinking
that I killed that man.

1629
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:17,560
I'll call you one day
and we'll meet for lunch.

1630
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:20,200
You take me to one
one of those restaurants you know.

1631
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:21,360
Of course it is.

1632
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:26,600
See you later.
Goodbye.

1633
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:31,200
Ramón.

1634
02:17:33,240 --> 02:17:36,800
Don't think about what happened.
You have nothing pending.

1635
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:16,600
(Music)
