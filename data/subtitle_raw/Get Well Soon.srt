00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,891
I'll tell you,
Bobby, it's bullshit.

3
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:25,155
Total bullshit.

4
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:28,637
I don't know.

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,335
What I do, is it art?

6
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:34,730
I don't know what it is.

7
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:36,906
It must be something
inside me.

8
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:40,214
Something's missing.
I don't know.

9
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,044
You know, Bobby...

10
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:47,308
I don't really believe in
all the inner child stuff

11
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:48,787
that people talk about now.

12
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:50,746
I think it's
all crap, really.

13
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,835
But every now and then,
I like to give

14
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,881
the little kid a piece
of candy just in case.

15
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:57,796
Seriously...

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,930
It's depressing as hell.

17
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:08,111
I know enough to know
that I'm depressed.

18
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:10,766
Who's responsible?

19
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:15,640
When did this happen?

20
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:16,467
I don't know.

21
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:18,078
Where is he?
I don't know.

22
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,123
Bobby, you're too kind.

23
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:21,168
You're much too kind.

24
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:24,649
I don't know
if I'm a genius.

25
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:28,871
Is he gonna come out?

26
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:29,872
I don't know.

27
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:31,221
Did he shave?

28
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:34,659
I think you know and I know
what it is that I do.

29
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:36,879
We both know it.

30
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:37,836
That I'm empty.

31
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,230
I'm a fucking
dancing squirrel.

32
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:42,406
I'm totally vacant.

33
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,843
Ok, ok.

34
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:49,500
I'm no artist.
I'm a chimp.

35
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:50,893
Anyway, Bobby.

36
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:53,461
Thanks very much, Bobby,
for having me on your show.

37
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:54,853
I really love your show,

38
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:57,726
and I hope you ask me back.

39
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,120
Nice to see
you again, buddy.

40
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:02,296
Bobby?

41
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:03,253
What?!

42
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:05,690
Hey, boy scout,
how are you?

43
00:02:07,562 --> 00:02:09,738
Give me a credit card.

44
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:10,913
You don't have
a credit card?

45
00:02:10,956 --> 00:02:12,741
Yeah, I have a...
I'm not using

46
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,177
a platinum card
on this door.

47
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:15,613
Now, give me
a goddamn credit card.

48
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:17,049
This is fucking serious.

49
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:17,963
Here.

50
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:19,791
Thank you.

51
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:21,837
10 bucks
you can't do it.

52
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,664
Are you kidding?

53
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:26,885
You have no idea
who I am.

54
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:31,586
Used to be a nice kid,
Jennifer, but now...

55
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,942
Why are you here?

56
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:43,728
Where are your, um...
Where are your clothes?

57
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:44,947
Tell me why you're here.

58
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,731
Hey, come on, come on.
You know why I'm here.

59
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:49,125
It's a big night, millions
of viewers, you know?

60
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,823
Going live without
a net, you know?

61
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,695
Just like Johnny.

62
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:54,739
Johnny got
to tape at 4:00.

63
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:56,045
Fuck him. Fuck him.
He's a dinosaur.

64
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:57,525
Fuck Leno,
fuck Letterman.

65
00:02:57,568 --> 00:03:00,310
Boy, you're the one.
You're the one.

66
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:01,224
You got guts.

67
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:02,399
Do me a favor,
will you?

68
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:03,922
You just put on
your clothes here.

69
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:05,272
We're gonna put on
your clothes,

70
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:07,099
and we're gonna
get out there,

71
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:08,927
and we're gonna
kick some ass.

72
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:11,800
I need a little
inspiration, Mitch.

73
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:14,585
I need to feel like I’m
having something to say.

74
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,152
Say anything you want.

75
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,894
Here, you want something
to say, say this...

76
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:20,678
This is called
a monologue.

77
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:23,899
I didn't mean
the Ally McBeal jokes,

78
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:24,726
Mitch.

79
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:26,510
I'm talking about...

80
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:28,599
Saying something
that I'm inspired by.

81
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:30,819
I know, I know, I know.
I know what you're saying.

82
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:33,300
I also know that
we got 5 minutes

83
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:36,651
and you're going on live.
Do you understand that?

84
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:38,957
I also know that
the most beautiful...

85
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:40,481
Bloodsucker in the universe
is on the show.

86
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:42,961
Your show, not O’Brien,
not Letterman.

87
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,267
Bishop live.Tonight.

88
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:47,009
So your clothes, you see.
Clothes are important.

89
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:49,054
Because tonight, you are
Bobby the vampire slayer.

90
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:54,234
And I am telling you, Bobby,
you fuck this up and it is...

91
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:56,018
It is suicide.

92
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:58,412
So come on, let's stick
a stake in this bitch

93
00:03:58,455 --> 00:03:59,587
and let's go out
and make

94
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,415
midnight with Bobby bishop
history.

95
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,809
It is silver bullet time.

96
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,421
My name is Kevin, Mitch.
Did you know that?

97
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:09,684
No. That's great.

98
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:11,251
Thank you for sharing.

99
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:13,992
And now,
coming all the way

100
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:17,474
from sunny Los Angeles,
California,

101
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:22,523
live, I repeat, live
from downtown L.A.,

102
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:25,569
it's midnight
with Bobby bishop.

103
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:28,529
Tonight, Bobby's guests
are the supermodel

104
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:32,446
and soon to be major
motion picture star,

105
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:35,100
Bridget bower!

106
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:38,321
The music of Tito Puente!

107
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:41,890
Television icon
Jerry mathers!

108
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:46,416
And, of course,
the midnight rockers!

109
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,161
Heeeere's America's
favorite baby blues,

110
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:55,382
Bobby bishop!

111
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:10,353
Loser.

112
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:12,355
Put on HBO.
Sex and the city is on.

113
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,315
No, Louis, no. You know I’m
trying not to watch it. No.

114
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,534
Sarah Jessica Parker's
so cute!

115
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:18,666
I'm not putting it on.

116
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:19,667
Beautiful people
always hump each other.

117
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,059
Exactly.
I'm not putting it on.

118
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:23,497
Not the ugly beautiful.
Always beautiful beautiful.

119
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,890
Yes!
Hey, I'm trying
to do a show here!

120
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,196
Sorry.

121
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,197
Hello?

122
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,155
Hi. I'm in here.

123
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,548
What's up?

124
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:32,549
Nothing.

125
00:05:32,593 --> 00:05:33,985
Anyway,
what kind of name...

126
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:35,726
Hey, what's this?

127
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,728
It's Chinese.

128
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:38,773
Hello...

129
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:41,732
Mmm. All right.

130
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:44,387
Ok.

131
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:45,388
Hi.

132
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:46,433
Hey.

133
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:48,522
Ooh. Ooh, Chinese.

134
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:50,262
Yeah, well, you know.

135
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:51,263
Who's on?

136
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:52,569
I don't know.
I just turned it on.

137
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:53,614
Put on Letterman.

138
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:55,267
You put on
Letterman.

139
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:57,661
I'm gonna
go wash my face.

140
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:00,360
Let's get outta here.
We'll be right back.

141
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:01,622
And we're out.

142
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:04,451
Christ. Hey, Al, you're
such a fucking idiot.

143
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:06,061
Back in 2, boss.

144
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:10,370
Ladies and gentlemen,
Al the genius.

145
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,589
Hey, hey, hey,
how you feeling?

146
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:13,416
Like shit.
No.

147
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,461
Is it me
or is it them?

148
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:15,723
Listen, they're...
They're tourists.

149
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,942
The band leader
is a real fuckup.

150
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:20,858
You're doing great.
You're kicking ass.
No, they're bullshit.

151
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:22,643
For god's sake,
you're sweating.

152
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:23,774
I'm fine. I'm fine.

153
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:25,385
Will you guys get
the fuck away from me?

154
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:26,429
He wants you away.

155
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:27,691
I said 3 times.

156
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,084
He shouldn't have to say it
more than 3 times.

157
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:32,043
Just back off.
I'm dying here.
This is live, Mitch.

158
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:33,871
Here's the crazy
headlines, Bobby.

159
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:34,829
This shit again.

160
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:35,786
Third one's
the funniest.

161
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,874
Barbershop chicken.

162
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,093
You, hey,
hey, get out.

163
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:39,399
Whatever you want.
You want a bullshit show.

164
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,183
Now, listen to me.I'll do a bullshit show.

165
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:42,619
You are a star.

166
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:43,751
Ok, good. Enough.

167
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:46,057
Brightest star
in the galaxy.

168
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:48,190
Mmm-ah. I love you.

169
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:53,804
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

170
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:54,718
We're back.

171
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:58,592
Hello. Welcome back.

172
00:06:58,635 --> 00:07:00,898
Bobby bishop...

173
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:04,467
Bridget?
Mitchell banks.

174
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,687
Big fan.

175
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,690
Cell is on the back.

176
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:10,430
Thank you.

177
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:13,215
Oh, big night.
Live TV.

178
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:14,172
Yep.

179
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:16,000
Bobby is my boy.
He's a big fan.

180
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:18,481
He's very nice.
He's shorter in person.

181
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:20,004
Well, when you get
to know him,

182
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:25,140
he's 10 feet tall,
and he's a big heart.

183
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,967
And...

184
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,317
Are you happy?

185
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:30,885
Back off, Mitchell.

186
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,277
Hey, look, Napoleon.

187
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:34,018
Don't listen to him,
kitten.

188
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:35,019
He touch you?

189
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:36,151
Ron, are you still
pissed off about

190
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:37,065
that Luke Perry thing?

191
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:40,764
I like Bobby.
He's sweet.

192
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:43,158
He looks like
Charlie Manson.

193
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:44,594
Ok, ladies and gentlemen.

194
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:49,730
My first guest has
the best personality

195
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:51,688
in the whole world.

196
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:52,863
Right.

197
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:56,084
And she can dance.
Oh, boy, can she dance.

198
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:57,955
And she's very pretty.

199
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:00,480
Ok, now I got
your attention.

200
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,351
Ladies and gentlemen,

201
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:06,703
supermodel
and super person,

202
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:09,619
Bridget bower.

203
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:16,365
Does Lily have a little
crush on Bobby bishop?

204
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:17,279
No.

205
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:19,542
I think he's funny.

206
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:22,023
He's a total moron.

207
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:28,856
Those are, uh...
Terrific shoes.

208
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,553
Thank you.

209
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:34,949
Nice shoes.

210
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:38,430
Ok, Bridget.

211
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:44,175
Isn't she beautiful?

212
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:48,571
Thank you so much
for coming, Bridget.

213
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:50,573
Thank you
for having me.

214
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:53,533
Bridget...

215
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,408
Yeah, that would be
a tall order, Bridget.

216
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,020
You know, we have
the same initials,

217
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:04,674
Bridget and I.

218
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:06,807
We do, I guess.

219
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,809
Yes. Yes, we do.

220
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,680
I'd like
to fuck you so much.

221
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:12,377
What?

222
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:13,248
What'd he say?

223
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,684
What'd he say?What'd he say?

224
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:15,772
What'd he say?

225
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:16,904
Holy shit.

226
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,775
I bet you get fucked
all the time, right?

227
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,255
What?
Go to commercial.

228
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:21,386
Get us out.
Are we out?

229
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,692
You're probably tired
of fucking, right?

230
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:25,782
You probably get tired
of fucking.

231
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:28,568
What'd I do?
What'd I do?
What'd I do?

232
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,613
What a freak.

233
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,051
Ok, we're out.

234
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:35,270
You're finished, ass-face.
Bridget, sweetheart,

235
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:36,924
he will pay with his blood,
I swear to god.

236
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,926
What did I do?
What'd I say?
What'd I say?

237
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:40,449
Hey. Hey, get out.

238
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:41,624
Here. I'm finished.

239
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:42,843
Like you weren't thinking
the same thing.

240
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,932
Not only did
he use profanity,

241
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:48,718
but he did so in a lewd
and lascivious manner.

242
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,328
I mean, we're talking...

243
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:52,635
We're talking breaking
F.C.C. Regulations,

244
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,332
we're talking
sexual harassment.

245
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:58,075
Rosie O'Donnell
is gonna crucify him.

246
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,600
What an idiot.

247
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:04,691
Stay right here.
Don't move.

248
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:06,649
He said it out loud.

249
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:07,781
He did.
I'm just saying,

250
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:09,826
I know I heard it,
but it was in my head.

251
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,262
You're crazy.

252
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:12,786
Yeah, how were we supposed
to know what's in your head?

253
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:14,135
Waves, man.

254
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:15,397
Keith, you...

255
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,748
You should not be allowed
to watch TV anymore.

256
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,577
I can't really be certain
that I said it.

257
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:27,888
Hello?

258
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:29,716
Hey, did you see it?

259
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,673
I'm speechless.

260
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,675
In Manhattan.
It's unpublished?

261
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,285
Same last name. Uh...

262
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:35,852
Try Linda Charles.

263
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,419
It's actually
kind of sad.

264
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:39,029
Kind of sad?

265
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,161
It's tragic...

266
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:42,250
What they're doing
to these poor animals.

267
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:43,817
Wait. What are
you watching?

268
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,687
Discovery.

269
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,080
What are you watching?

270
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:47,777
Bobby bishop.

271
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,344
Oh, who's on?

272
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:50,562
Um, forget it.

273
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:52,260
Let me call you tomorrow.

274
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:53,870
Ok. Put on 31.

275
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:55,742
Ok. Bye.

276
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:57,395
Who was that?

277
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:58,309
Oh, Cindy.

278
00:10:58,353 --> 00:10:59,484
Oh, yeah?
What does she think

279
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:01,356
of your knight
in shining armor?

280
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,359
Shut up.
She didn't even watch it.

281
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:06,056
She didn't?
Mm-mmm.

282
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:13,977
Hello? Hello?

283
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:19,766
Stupid cocksucker.

284
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:22,769
You fuck.

285
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:25,902
Oh, you fuck, you fuck.

286
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,912
Hello, Mitch.

287
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:36,957
Mmm.

288
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,786
Say, can I ask you
a question?

289
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:42,397
What the fuck,
uh, Bob?

290
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,880
Listen, um,
who's your biggest fan?

291
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,185
My mother.

292
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:51,536
Uh-huh. Aside from
that Saint of a woman,

293
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,278
who's your biggest fan?

294
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:59,153
I don't think I have
any other fans.

295
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:00,937
What happened
to your eye?

296
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:02,199
What happened?

297
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,375
Loyalty.

298
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:07,857
Loyalty.
A sterling character.

299
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:09,859
What happened?

300
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:11,818
Bridget bower.

301
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:13,602
Bridget bower hit you?

302
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:14,734
No, no, I wish.

303
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,910
No, her bratty
little agent attacked me.

304
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:17,998
I'm sorry
about that, Mitch.

305
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,608
No, don't be sorry.It's my fault.

306
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,175
No, no.
Don't be sorry.

307
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:22,350
I respect
what you did.

308
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:23,830
I don't...I don't
necessarily understand it,

309
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:26,441
but I respect that you're
an artist, you made a choice.

310
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:27,877
I dig that.
But, you know,

311
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:31,794
you're also a...
You're a talk show host.

312
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:33,883
You're the voice
of America.

313
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:35,363
There are rules.

314
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:36,886
I mean,
I...I...I dig it.

315
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,889
I mean,
I was thinking it myself.

316
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:43,197
But what the fuck, Bob?

317
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:46,200
What? I don't know.

318
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:47,723
What'd I say?

319
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,942
I say something wrong?

320
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:50,334
No.
My head was pounding,

321
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:51,945
hey.
It just slipped out.

322
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:53,773
Hey, I saw her tits.

323
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,862
I saw that.
I dig that.

324
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:57,211
Your head was pounding.

325
00:12:57,254 --> 00:12:58,778
I dig that.
But what was going on?

326
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,127
I mean, could you not
see the cue cards?

327
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,999
The cue cards were there.
Was your vision blurred?

328
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:04,435
W-W-Were you ad-libbing?

329
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:05,828
If you were riffing,
I get that.

330
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:06,873
But help me.
Help me, baby.

331
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,832
Help Mitchell
help Bobby.

332
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:12,313
I can't help you.
I don't know why.

333
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:13,662
I don't know
why I did it.

334
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:14,837
I don't know
why I said it.

335
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:17,231
I don't know.
All I know is

336
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:19,842
I think Rosie O'Donnell
is gonna crucify me.

337
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:21,496
Oh, no. Now, uh...

338
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:24,412
Now, you just listen
to me. Don't stress.

339
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:26,022
I got it.
I got it.

340
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:27,545
Don't stress.
Don't...

341
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:28,982
Just give me
a second.

342
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:33,508
Don't anybody
fucking panic.

343
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,859
Ok. Ok.

344
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:38,861
Here's what we do.

345
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:40,428
No, Mitch. Come on.

346
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:41,864
No, no.
Just listen to me.

347
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,257
Mitch, Mitch.Here's what we do.

348
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,954
I'm tired...
Ok, I got it.

349
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,782
Listen to me.

350
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:49,306
We get, like...
We get...We...

351
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,134
We find a well.

352
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:52,657
You get that?
Mitch...

353
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:54,094
No, stay with me.

354
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:55,486
Just listen. Listen to me.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

355
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,400
Stay with me.

356
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:57,619
Aren't you
a little tired now?

357
00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:59,099
Let's just let it go.

358
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:02,885
We find, like,
a puppy or...

359
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:04,887
A baby.

360
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:05,975
And we...

361
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:08,935
We drop the thing
in the well.

362
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:10,632
You got that?

363
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:11,981
I'm confused.

364
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:13,243
All right, then.
Just hold on,
hold on, hold on.

365
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,636
The puppy
or the baby?

366
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,290
Here's the deal.

367
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:19,467
The kid's puppy runs
out into the freeway

368
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,860
as you're
driving home.

369
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:21,730
And you're dodging.

370
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:22,949
Dodging cars
left and right,

371
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,602
right and left.
And the puppy,

372
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:26,996
it starts barking.
Do you understand?

373
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,998
Barking.
It starts barking

374
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:30,304
its fucking
puppy head off.

375
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:32,393
I get it, I get it.
So I see the puppy.

376
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:33,394
It is just barking.
Right.

377
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:35,700
And it alerts you
to the tragedy,

378
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:39,617
and it takes you
back to the well,

379
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:42,011
and you can
just go fuck

380
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:42,969
Rosie O'Donnell.

381
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:45,275
You can fuck
Rosie O'Donnell,

382
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,494
because you...

383
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:48,235
You're
a fucking hero.

384
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:49,497
I'm supposed
to get in the well?

385
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,977
No, you don't get
in the well.

386
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,892
Why would you get
in the well?

387
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,589
You...

388
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:55,633
Boss?

389
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:57,157
Entertainment tonight's
here.

390
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,680
Tell 'em

391
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:00,290
he's a fucking hero.

392
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,249
Oh, and, uh, Joanie?

393
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:04,555
Um, find us a baby.

394
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:07,254
Come on.
Quick, quick.

395
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:08,733
I can't take this.

396
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:10,605
I'm gonna go
to New York.

397
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:13,173
You deal with it.

398
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,610
Um...

399
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,220
Ok. Why are you...

400
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:20,397
Why are you going
to New York?

401
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:28,840
Come on. Pick it up.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

402
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:33,845
Pick it up, pick it up,
pick it up, pick it up.

403
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:35,108
Hey, Keith!

404
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:36,283
No smoking out here.

405
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:37,371
Yeah, uh, hold on.

406
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:38,720
Keith, no smoking
outside the lounge.

407
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:39,808
Are you in the lounge?

408
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:40,809
I'm on the phone.

409
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:42,724
You're in the hallway.
Put it out.

410
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:49,122
Thank you.
Come on, pick it up.

411
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:49,949
I'm on the phone!

412
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:51,907
Hang it up.
Pick it up.

413
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,735
Hang it up.

414
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:55,215
Oh, god!

415
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:56,651
Hang it up.

416
00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:58,783
Hang it up.
Pick it up.

417
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,829
Hang it up.
Hang it up.

418
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:02,744
Fuck.

419
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:04,137
Keith, nobody likes
a litterbug.

420
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,488
Pick it up.
Come on, pick it up.

421
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:10,752
Thank you.

422
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:14,364
Uh, oh, uh,
your sister's here.

423
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,812
There you are.

424
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:32,817
Hi, kid.

425
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:35,907
I'm very sad today.

426
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:36,952
Why, sunshine?

427
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,825
I don't know.
Just...Very sad.

428
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:44,612
Oh. I bought you cigarettes
and starbursts.

429
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:47,919
Yay! Treats!

430
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,533
Oh...mmm.

431
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,594
Thank you.

432
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:27,133
Hey, slim,
you got a smoke?

433
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:28,786
Yeah.

434
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:30,658
Here. Keep 'em.

435
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:34,401
Oh, thanks.
You got a light?

436
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:38,883
Here.

437
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:40,755
Thank you.

438
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:42,583
You're welcome.

439
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:09,305
I don't want to talk about
Sarah Jessica Parker anymore.

440
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:10,611
Ok. Sorry.

441
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:12,395
I mean, I don't why you
have HBO in here anyway.

442
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,571
But she's so scrunchy.

443
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:17,748
She's like
a little corn muffin.

444
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:20,099
Keith.

445
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:22,362
What?!

446
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:23,450
All right. Remember
when you told me

447
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:25,016
to tell you when
you're being unstable?

448
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,887
Yes.

449
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,671
You're being unstable.

450
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:28,716
Ok. Sorry.

451
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:29,717
All right.

452
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,327
How's dick?

453
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:33,895
Mark is fine.
He says, "hi."

454
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:35,810
How's mom?

455
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:36,985
She's all right.

456
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:37,942
She's a little worried
about the job thing.

457
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:38,900
She's stopped coming
to visit me.

458
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:40,249
She said she felt
a weird vibe.

459
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:41,946
I'm, like, "mom,
you're in a mental
institution."

460
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,950
Well, she didn't mean it.
She's a little kooky. Hmm.

461
00:18:51,913 --> 00:18:53,175
Mmm.

462
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:55,873
Mmm.

463
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:08,886
Ok, I saw it.

464
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,976
Ok. So then, that
was out loud then.

465
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,717
Oh, it was definitely
out loud.

466
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:15,502
Wow.

467
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:20,202
What?

468
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:21,203
What?

469
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:23,945
What's going on?
What, what, what?

470
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:24,989
What...nothing.

471
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,077
You know
something.
I do not.

472
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:27,818
Yes, you do.
What do I know?

473
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:29,994
I don't know.
Something.
I...I don't.

474
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:33,215
What is it?Keith, you're paranoid.

475
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,477
Did you talk
to him?

476
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:35,957
No!
Are you sure?

477
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,176
Yes, I'm sure.

478
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,178
Maybe he was sending you
some kind of signal.

479
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,962
By telling a model
he wants to fuck her?

480
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,006
I don't think so.

481
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,878
Are you sure you
didn't talk to him?

482
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:45,053
Yes, Keith.

483
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:46,272
I have not spoken
to Kevin moss in years.

484
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:48,839
But did you talk
to Bobby bishop?

485
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,667
They're
the same person, idiot!

486
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,147
I didn't...

487
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:55,019
Look...

488
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:56,064
Eat one of those.

489
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,935
Yes.

490
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:06,988
Hi.
Hey.

491
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:08,511
Can I have, um,

492
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:09,817
a pack of viceroy?

493
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,776
Don't touch
the fucking bag.

494
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,865
Turn around.

495
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:16,432
Hey.

496
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:21,742
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.

497
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:23,439
Bobby bishop.

498
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:24,266
Right.

499
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,528
Bobby bishop.

500
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:26,529
You got it.

501
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:27,835
Can you give me
a break?

502
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:30,011
You don't fucking
remember me?

503
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:31,447
I think so. Yeah.

504
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:33,101
Oh, yeah?
I think
I remember you.

505
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:35,277
Yeah?
What's my name?

506
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:36,017
Um...

507
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,454
Brian Maher, huh?

508
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:39,455
You got that?

509
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:40,282
You're Brian Maher.

510
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:41,457
Fucking superstar,
right?

511
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:43,198
Forget all the little
people, right?

512
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,243
What do you mean?

513
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,592
I remember you.

514
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:47,507
I remember you
when you were
fucking Kevin, man.

515
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,769
We were in
the same class.

516
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:50,901
When you were still Kevin.You really know me.

517
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:52,294
Now you're getting it.

518
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:53,469
Did we go to school
together?
Yeah, that's right.

519
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:54,862
Mr. Ripton's
western civ...

520
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:56,559
I remember you.You remember me?

521
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:57,778
Yeah, you were
a good guy.

522
00:20:57,821 --> 00:20:59,823
You were my favorite.
You were my favorite.

523
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:02,739
Fuck you.
You were a fucking
douche bag, but hey...

524
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:03,784
Oh, come on.

525
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,177
You're a big shot now.
Bobby bishop.

526
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:10,007
Who was that girl,
though? Deleila, um...

527
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:11,139
Lily.
Lily!

528
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:12,445
My girlfriend, Lily.
Yeah, she was nice.

529
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:14,316
Did you know her brother
went fucking nuts?

530
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,057
Keith?
Keith.

531
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,885
Keith went nuts?

532
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:18,712
Yeah.

533
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:19,756
He fucking
put banana peels

534
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,888
all over his naked body,
ran through

535
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:24,021
a fucking museum
screaming, "don't slip!"

536
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:25,414
Can you fucking
imagine that?

537
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,937
That's crazy.
Yeah.

538
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:28,025
You look good.
You look good.

539
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:29,984
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you look good.

540
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:31,855
Can I get a pack
of cigarettes here

541
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:33,117
and just go?

542
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:34,380
Yeah, yeah.

543
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:37,034
Ok, can I...Keep that.
And matches. Thank you.

544
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:38,993
Take care.
Yeah, be well.

545
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:40,342
Ok.

546
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:41,517
Talk to you.

547
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:42,213
Ok.

548
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:43,040
UN-fucking-believable.

549
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:44,128
Hey, you got
a card, man?

550
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:47,001
Yeah. Shit, man.

551
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:48,785
Yeah, stay in touch.

552
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:49,699
Ok.

553
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:50,874
I'd love to get down
with you.

554
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:51,701
Yeah.

555
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:54,182
Be well, huh?

556
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:04,932
Would you untape me,
please?

557
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:06,716
You know,
I should be mad at her

558
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,067
for smuggling in contraband,
but, well, she's pretty.

559
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:11,591
And I'll tell her.

560
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:12,722
I mean, she got
all the looks

561
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:13,767
in the family,
you know?

562
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,160
Come on, my arms
are falling asleep.

563
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:18,032
Not until group.

564
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:23,211
You know, um...

565
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:25,735
I know famous people.

566
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:26,867
Mm-hmm.

567
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,390
Oh, I...No, really.
I know famous people.

568
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:31,306
Tony newly does
not impress me.

569
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,742
You would freak out

570
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,396
if you know who
I'm thinking of.

571
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,832
I mean,
you would freak.

572
00:22:38,835 --> 00:22:40,097
If you knew who I know.

573
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:41,925
I'll just leave it at that.

574
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:48,018
Hello.

575
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:50,107
Hey, how are you,
baby doll?

576
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:52,414
I'm weird, Mitch.

577
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,198
Very, very weird.

578
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:55,199
Come on,
you're not weird.

579
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:57,419
You're, uh...
You're creative.

580
00:22:57,463 --> 00:22:58,681
What do you want?

581
00:22:58,725 --> 00:22:59,552
What about
that girl's mother?
You find her?

582
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:03,077
No. Nobody's home.
No mother.

583
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,426
I need a favor.

584
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,688
Anything, Bobby, baby.

585
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:07,298
We're gonna beat this
thing called depression.

586
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:10,258
Lily's brother's
in a mental ward.

587
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:11,781
I need you
to find him.

588
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:15,916
His name is, uh,
Keith Charles.

589
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,134
Keith Charles.

590
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:19,180
Ok, I’m
writing it down.

591
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:21,182
Did you write it down?

592
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:24,228
All right, I'll get
my people on it.

593
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:25,752
It's done.

594
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:27,406
Oh, listen, Bob?

595
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,538
They love the
"I want to fuck you"
line in the reporter.

596
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:33,412
Right. Whatever.
Just find him, all right?

597
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:39,635
Mom!

598
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,948
Mom?

599
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:53,040
Can you spare
a dime?

600
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,259
Spare some change?

601
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:57,218
Mom?

602
00:23:57,261 --> 00:24:00,743
Lily. Oh, my angel.
Give me a kiss.

603
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:04,573
Mom, what are you doing?
Come on, you're filthy.
What are doing out here?

604
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:05,618
I'm practicing.

605
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:08,490
You're practicing?
You're practicing?

606
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:09,839
Come on. Get up.
Come on.

607
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:11,275
All right,
take it easy.

608
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,147
Oh, god.
Oh, please.

609
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,062
You want a smoke?

610
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:16,280
Since when
are you smoking?

611
00:24:16,324 --> 00:24:18,152
Whose is this?
Where'd you get it?

612
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:19,240
Oh, this sweet lady.

613
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:21,634
She covered me with
it Saturday night.

614
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:22,504
Look at me.

615
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:24,027
You're doing this
at night?

616
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,289
No, not last night.

617
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,813
You're sleeping out
on the streets?

618
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,771
So you slept out here, mom?
Come on.

619
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:30,164
No, no, not last night.

620
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:33,123
Last night my back
was just killing me.

621
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:37,432
Yes, uh, operator.
Um, how are you?

622
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:40,304
Great.

623
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:42,611
Listen, in Manhattan?

624
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:46,354
What is the most popular
mental hospital?

625
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:47,660
Ok, listen to me.

626
00:24:47,703 --> 00:24:51,054
I just found out some
very serious information.

627
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:52,099
Ok.

628
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:54,318
This is wicked shit.
Very hush-hush.

629
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:55,494
Ok.

630
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,539
Let me get
some starbursts.

631
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:58,671
No way.

632
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:00,194
Ok, forget it.

633
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:01,804
Ok, fine.

634
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:03,414
Give me all
the yellow ones.

635
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,286
No, I'll give you
strawberry.

636
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:06,592
What's
going on here?

637
00:25:06,635 --> 00:25:07,418
Nothing.

638
00:25:07,462 --> 00:25:08,289
Nothing, Louis.
Take off.

639
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:10,030
No. Tell me what's
so secret.

640
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:11,771
Nothing.
Not a thing.
Take a walk.

641
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:13,903
I'll leave...
If you give me
some starbursts.

642
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:16,427
Forget it. You can stay.
Keep your mouth shut.

643
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:17,951
Ok.

644
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:19,735
Barry just told me
that he happens to
be very good friends

645
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:22,477
with Matthew Broderick's
dogwalker.

646
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,478
No way!

647
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,915
I'd fuck
Matthew Broderick's dog.

648
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,221
Focus.

649
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:28,962
Why did he
tell you this?

650
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:30,398
I got him a date.

651
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:31,965
I don't get it.

652
00:25:32,008 --> 00:25:36,230
Matthew Brodericks's dog is
50% Sarah Jessica Parker's
dog.

653
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:38,275
Oh.

654
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,668
I don't get it.

655
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:41,931
I saw Keith today.

656
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:45,065
How is he?

657
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:47,241
He's fine. You know.

658
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:51,332
Is he still in
that dreadful place?

659
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:52,725
Yes, mother.

660
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:57,556
I won't go there, though.
That place has bad Karma.

661
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,600
Yeah, he told me.

662
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:00,210
Where did you get this?

663
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:02,648
Give me one
of those smokies.

664
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:04,475
Why are you smoking?

665
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,781
It's tough out there.

666
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:08,567
Mom, come on.
You're not homeless.

667
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,655
I could be.

668
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:12,353
Yeah, we all could be,
but you're not.

669
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:15,835
I just want
to make sure

670
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:17,401
that I can hack it
out there.

671
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:19,839
Oh, come on, mom.
Everything's gonna be fine.

672
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:22,363
How do you know? You're
not old and unemployed.

673
00:26:22,406 --> 00:26:24,583
You don't know
what it's like.

674
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:27,237
You're all Keith's age
out there.

675
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:28,499
This isn't a joke,
you know?

676
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:29,892
You're not gonna be able
to survive out there.

677
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:32,852
I met this nice
little black man

678
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:34,984
who said he'd keep
an eye on me

679
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:37,378
if I gave him
some gum.

680
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:38,292
You met a man?

681
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:39,249
This little fella.

682
00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:42,601
3 feet nothing,
but so sweet.

683
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:45,255
And tough as nails.

684
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,648
Is he the one
who gave you this?

685
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:50,043
Oh, no.
That was a white guy.

686
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:53,002
What white guy?

687
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:54,047
Nothin'.

688
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,178
No machine?

689
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:56,745
Nothin'.
Yeah. Give me
another number.

690
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:58,312
I'm going
back to "a".

691
00:26:58,355 --> 00:26:59,879
Just pick
another number.

692
00:26:59,922 --> 00:27:03,839
Oh, here's one.
Adams, Ann.

693
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:04,753
212...

694
00:27:04,797 --> 00:27:06,276
Well, obviously
it's 212.

695
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,670
Well, it could
be 718...Crabby.

696
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:10,541
Keith,
you got
a visitor.

697
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:11,630
Yeah. I'm on
the phone.

698
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,066
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.

699
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:14,458
Move it.
Move it.

700
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:15,459
718.

701
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:16,286
Brooklyn.

702
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,680
It's a Manhattan
directory!

703
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:22,423
It is.

704
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:26,383
Nathan, you were
here to assist us.

705
00:27:26,427 --> 00:27:28,385
Mom, was he taller than me?

706
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:31,127
I don't know,
I was in position.

707
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:32,999
In position?
What does that mean?

708
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,914
When you beg...

709
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:37,917
You should be
sitting below
eye level,

710
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,832
or else whitey
gets scared.

711
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:42,399
Whitey?
Arthur told me that.

712
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:43,357
Arthur?

713
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,620
My little
black protector.

714
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:49,450
Mom, where's the new one?

715
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:50,538
Try the bottom.

716
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:53,454
Ok. Is this him?

717
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:55,238
No.

718
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:56,500
It's not?Do you want a bagel?

719
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,720
This is not the guy

720
00:27:58,764 --> 00:27:59,634
They're frozen.

721
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,897
I don't want a bagel.

722
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:05,031
Sorry. I don't know...

723
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:07,468
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

724
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,472
You know who he
reminded me of?

725
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:12,342
Who?

726
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:15,432
Kevin moss.

727
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:25,399
Ok, let's cut
to the chase.

728
00:28:25,442 --> 00:28:29,011
Oh...whoa.

729
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:31,361

00:28:31,405 --> 00:28:32,754
How ya doin'?

731
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:35,583
Tip-top. So, uh,
Barry filled you in?

732
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:38,325
All right?
You know the deal
is very hush-hush,

733
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:41,415
so, uh,
let's get started.

734
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:44,374
Wow. What's goin' on?

736
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:48,465
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

737
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:51,555
Maybe some kind
of smaller dog?
A spaniel?

738
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,342
Maybe it's a golden?
Right? A golden?

739
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:56,778
I think you, uh,

740
00:28:56,822 --> 00:29:00,826
I think you're confusing me
with somebody else, Keith.

741
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:05,482
I, uh...

742
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:09,486
No! No! No! Don't!
I shouldn't see
your face.

743
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,837
Ok. Ok.
It's me. It's me.

744
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,708

Let me ask you something.

Are you really crazy?

758
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:44,695

00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:46,262
No.

760
00:29:46,697 --> 00:29:48,656
Would you not
speak for me?

761
00:29:48,699 --> 00:29:50,571
Would you just
be quiet, please?

762
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:51,572
I'm trying to talk
to somebody.

763
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:54,227
I didn't mean
to get in the way.

764
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,751

I'm fine.

769
00:30:09,982 --> 00:30:12,985
Hey! We got a guy
in here who thinks
he's you.

770
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:16,162
Really? Maybe he can
take over my show.

771
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:19,556
Hey, do you know
Sarah Jessica Parker?

772
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,993
Uh, she was
on the show once,

773
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:23,038
but I don't...We're not
friends or anything.

774

do you think she has?

778
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:34,223
I don't know.

779
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:36,965

00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,450
Ok, I'm going
to do something.

903
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:49,799
No, don't, please.
Don't do anything.

904
00:35:49,843 --> 00:35:51,671
Let's mess
with him
a little bit.

905
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:52,846

00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:07,904
What's goin' on?

916
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:11,386
Don't think you
can come back
so easy, TV boy.

917
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,172
We know
who you are and
what you want.

918
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:15,260
Kevin.what do I want?

919
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:17,436
What do I want?
The girl was a model.

920
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:18,567
Who's a model?

921
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:21,135
Jesus,
this neighborhood
is so fucked.

922
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,007
Just leave
us alone!

923
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:29,361
Hey!

924
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:32,407
Hey!

925
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:42,069
Hey!

926
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:49,772
Hey!

927
00:36:49,816 --> 00:36:51,078
Ladies room!

928
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:51,992
What happened?

929
00:36:52,035 --> 00:36:54,647
Ladies room.
No time. Come on.

930
00:36:57,737 --> 00:36:58,781
Hello?

931
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:00,043
Hey, Bob.

932
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:02,263
Aw, man!

933
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:06,224
Bob?

934
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:12,012
I can't take this.

935
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:25,025
Excuse me, did you see
a woman with black hair...

936
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,069
Just came in here?

937
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:28,115
Black hair. Long hair.
Straight hair.

938
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:29,638
I don't know.

939
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:30,944
Fuckin' jerk.

940
00:37:30,987 --> 00:37:32,511

00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:35,557
Anybody see a woman
with black hair?
She just came in here.

942
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:36,602
I think we're
safe here.

943
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:37,733
What did you
say to him?

944
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:39,213
I just told him
to step off.

945
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,258
He won't
come in here.

946
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:41,781
This is
the ladies room.
We're ok.

947
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:44,044
He told a model
on live television
he wants to fuck her.

948
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:45,828
You don't think he's gonna
come into the ladies room?

949
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:48,744
No one saw her?
No one saw a girl
with black hair?

950
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:50,833
Did you see a girl
with black hair?
Come on.

951
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:53,662
Where...did you see
a girl with black hair?
She was just in here.

952
00:37:53,706 --> 00:37:54,446
Ladies room.

953
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:56,796
Thank you. Thank you.

00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:15,336
Hello?

955
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,424

00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:24,214
I'll just wait
over here then.

958
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:26,695
This is
harassment.

959
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,175
You attacked me.

960
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:30,395
I'm looking for
Lily Charles.

961
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:31,091
Why?

962
00:38:31,134 --> 00:38:32,614
I need to find her.

963
00:38:32,658 --> 00:38:35,182
Can you help me find Lily?
I'm not feeling good.

964
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:38,968
I'm...I really would like
to find her and talk to her.

965
00:38:39,012 --> 00:38:40,927
You know, for
a talk show host,

966
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,537
you're not
too articulate.

967
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:45,018
Ok. Ok. You're funny.
You're funny.

968
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:46,976
Ok? You're a pro.

969
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,544
Come on my show.
You can tell your jokes.

970
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:51,372
Hi.

971
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:57,509
I'm trying
to eat vegetarian.

972
00:38:57,552 --> 00:39:00,773
So, um...

973
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,298
I'll have the meatloaf.

974
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,126
Is she in there?

975
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:07,910
Lily?

976
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:10,478
She is
different now.

977
00:39:10,522 --> 00:39:13,960
I'm different, too.
I'm a lot different now.

978
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:15,004
Hold on.

979
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:17,398
I'm reading
something
on the wall.

980
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:21,750
Oh, "crock...

981
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:23,186

00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:29,062
I am peeing.

985
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:29,889
You hear it?

986
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:32,065
No, I don't hear it.

987
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:35,111
I bet you she's
still amazing,
like before.

988
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:37,853
I'd really like
to be amazed again.

989
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:39,986
Fuck you!
You need to be
amazed again?!

990
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:41,335
I knew it. I knew
you were in there.

991
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,946
Drop dead you TV

992
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,470

00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:47,994
All right!

994
00:39:48,037 --> 00:39:48,908
Let's go.

995
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:50,126
It's just,
it's my wife there.

996
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,954
Lily, can you just
come outside for a second?

997
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:52,955
What are you
doing there?

998
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:54,087
You look great.

999
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,175
Come on.
What are you doing?

1000
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:56,219
You look
really nice.

1001
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:57,220
Have some dignity.
Let's go. Come on.

1002
00:39:57,264 --> 00:39:59,484
Just come
outside for
a second?

1003
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:02,530
Boy, did she
look great.

1004
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:04,140
Didn't you think
she looked great?

1005
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:05,490
I hear ya.
Let's go, pal.

1006
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:07,100
Really beautiful.

1007
00:40:07,143 --> 00:40:08,971
Oh, uh...

1008
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:11,321
Holy shit.

1009
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:14,020
That was Bobby bishop.

1010
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:17,066
He looks like shit.

1011
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,851
Ok, everyone knew
the movie stunk.

1012
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:20,461
So I looked at him
right in the eyes,

1013
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:24,291
and I said,
"Jean Claude,
the movie stinks."

1014
00:40:25,205 --> 00:40:26,380
Right?
The movie stinks.

1015
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,513
And since then,
he won't talk
to me again.

1016
00:40:28,556 --> 00:40:31,472
So I said, "ok,
great. Don't put him
on the show.."

1017
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:33,169
This is going
to Lulu, right?

1018
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:38,000
Ok...dear, sweet...

1019
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:42,265
Lulu.

1020
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:45,573

1021
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:49,925
Bobby...bishop.

1022
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:51,971
Here ya go.

1023
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:54,495

girlfriend's Ann.

1024
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,889
Hey!

1025
00:40:56,932 --> 00:40:58,281
Hey! I'm in here.

1026
00:40:58,325 --> 00:41:01,110
I'll be right there.
I'm just gonna
get some water.

1027
00:41:05,637 --> 00:41:07,421
Where were you today?

1028
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,076
I was out
visiting my mom.

1029
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:12,861
Oh. How is crazy lady?

1030
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:14,297
She's fine.

1031
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:17,518
Her and Keith
should room together.

1032
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:20,347
I saw him today, too.

1033
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:30,226
Sounds like
you had a crazy day.

1034
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,706
Jeez.

1035
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,707
Don't.

1036
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:35,231
Sorry.

1037
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,711
What'd you eat?

1038
00:41:36,755 --> 00:41:39,932
I just, uh,
got the meatloaf
at Lenny's.

1039
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:43,022
Jeez! Are
you all right?
What the...

1040
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:44,110
Jeez.

1041
00:41:44,153 --> 00:41:46,199
I'm sorry.
It's so stupid.
I got it.

1042
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:46,982
Yes.

1043
00:41:47,026 --> 00:41:50,420
So, um,
guess who I saw?

1044
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:51,204
Who?

1045
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:52,205
Oh, just
your boyfriend.

1046
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:53,641
Bobby bishop.

1047
00:41:53,685 --> 00:41:54,555
Ow!

1048
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,165
God. You know what?
I got it.

1049
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:58,472
I'll do it.
You just wash
your finger, ok?

1050
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,778
Jeez.

1051
00:41:59,821 --> 00:42:02,171
You know, so I’m
at Lenny's, right?

1052
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:05,435
And fucking Bobby,
Bobby bishop
walks in the door.

1053
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:07,655
Did you say
anything to him?

1054
00:42:10,092 --> 00:42:11,746
I spit at him.

1055
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:12,965
You spit at him.

1056
00:42:13,008 --> 00:42:14,314
Totally, yeah.
And people,
like, went nuts.

1057
00:42:14,357 --> 00:42:17,186
They were, like,
clapping, and they
stood up, and...

1058
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,623
What an
asshole.
I know.

1059
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:21,103
What an asshole
thing to do.

1060
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:22,191
What?

1061
00:42:22,235 --> 00:42:23,279
I can't believe
you would spit at him.

1062
00:42:23,323 --> 00:42:24,672
Asshole?
I'm an asshole?

1063
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:28,197
He's, like,
the biggest pervert
known to mankind.

1064
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:29,503
He's not a pervert.

1065
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,593
Are you joking?
He fucking asked
Bridget bower

1066
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:34,856
to have sex with him
on television.

1067
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,337
Bridget bower is a whore.

1068
00:42:37,772 --> 00:42:41,167
She's a...Wow,
whoa, whaa.

1069
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,125
Jeez, you know?
Just...

1070
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:45,475
We're arguing about
a talk show host.

1071
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:47,173
No, we're not arguing
about a talk show host.

1072
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:50,045
We're arguing
because you are an asshole.

1073
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:52,526
All right? I'm gonna
take a bath.

1074
00:42:57,618 --> 00:42:59,620
I'm an asshole.

1075
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:01,143
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

1076
00:43:01,187 --> 00:43:02,188
Excuse me.

1077
00:43:02,231 --> 00:43:03,189
I haven't eaten.

1078
00:43:03,232 --> 00:43:06,409
I'm an asshole?

1079
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:11,414
Did you buzz today earlier?

1080
00:43:14,243 --> 00:43:16,942
So, you see, I'm empty.

1081
00:43:16,985 --> 00:43:19,509
I'm broken.

1082
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,732
Go away!

1083
00:43:24,776 --> 00:43:27,256
I can't believe that
you're mad about this.

1084
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:29,650
Come on.
Just beat it.

1085
00:43:29,694 --> 00:43:34,568
It's like...You're acting
like you know the guy.

1086
00:43:38,746 --> 00:43:41,662
Fine. Psycho.

1087
00:43:41,706 --> 00:43:46,493
Pretty in pink
is a much better
love story than mannequin.

1088
00:43:46,536 --> 00:43:47,929
It is not.

1089
00:43:47,973 --> 00:43:52,412
Rich guy falls for girl
from wrong side of the tracks.

1090
00:43:52,455 --> 00:43:54,719
Finds taboo love.

1091
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:56,372
What can be
more taboo

1092
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:59,854
than a guy
who falls for
a life-sized doll?

1093
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,423
I used to sleep
with a doll.

1094
00:44:04,424 --> 00:44:06,513
Uh, hey!

1095
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:08,558
Hey! What's
going on? Hey!

1096
00:44:08,602 --> 00:44:10,386
Hey!

1097
00:44:12,301 --> 00:44:16,523
Hey, the board feels
late-night TV's
a bad influence.

1098
00:44:16,566 --> 00:44:17,698
We're crazy.

1099
00:44:17,742 --> 00:44:20,527
Hey, I'm trying.

1100
00:44:22,007 --> 00:44:24,183
I'm trying, guys.

1101
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,239
If days
of the week
had a color,

1102
00:44:37,283 --> 00:44:40,155
what would
Tuesday be?

1103
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:41,287
Sky blue.

1104
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:42,680
Navy.

1105
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:45,117
No, uh...Dark brown.

1106
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,814
Like
a chocolate.

1107
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:48,816
Bobby! Mr. Bishop!

1108
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,948
What happened?
Any comment?

1109
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:51,819
Did you know you can
pay bail with visa?

1110
00:44:51,863 --> 00:44:54,169
I didn't know that.
Did you know that?

1111
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:54,953
No.

1112
00:44:54,996 --> 00:44:56,215
That's crazy.

1113
00:44:56,258 --> 00:44:58,478
Talk show host Bobby bishop
in trouble again.

1114
00:44:58,521 --> 00:45:01,089
Arrested and in love
in New York City.

1115
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:04,266
Only on news 6 at 11:00.

1116
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:08,749
Hello?

1117
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,316
Mark. Hi. How are you?

1118
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:12,274
Hey, how ya doin'?
She's in the tub.

1119
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:15,451
Oh, you're not
watching TV, are you?

1120
00:45:15,495 --> 00:45:16,539
Yeah. Why?

1121
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:17,976
Put on 31. Quick.

1122
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:20,065
All right.

1123
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:23,633
Take it easy.
Hold on.

1124
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:25,766
Uh, ok. Great.

1125
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,812
I'm not really
into pandas, though.

1126
00:45:27,855 --> 00:45:29,509
Ok? Bye.

1127
00:45:29,552 --> 00:45:32,730
No, Mark. Shit!

1128
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,345
Hello?

1129
00:45:39,388 --> 00:45:41,390
Uh, I'm sorry.
I need to talk to Lily.

1130
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:43,784
Uh, what channel
are you watching?

1131
00:45:43,828 --> 00:45:45,655
I'm on, uh...

1132
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:46,961
Why am I telling you
what channel I'm on?

1133
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:49,572
She's in the tub.
God.

1134
00:45:49,616 --> 00:45:53,881
What a dick.
What a dick!

1135
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:58,799
Oh...

1136
00:46:00,932 --> 00:46:03,717
Ok, hold on
a second.

1137
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:06,415
Lily!

1138
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:11,594
What?

1139
00:46:11,638 --> 00:46:13,771
Cindy's on the phone.
She says it's important.

1140
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:16,817
For her to be
an asshole. Now.

1141
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:20,560
All right...

1142
00:46:20,603 --> 00:46:21,822
I'm gonna
open the door.

1143
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:24,869
I'm gonna
open the door
just a crack, ok?

1144
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:28,481
And I want you to
pass me the phone.

1145
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:29,830
Come on.

1146
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:32,093
I'm serious.

1147
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:34,879
All right.

1148
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:37,185
Hello?

1149
00:46:37,229 --> 00:46:38,012
It's right here.

1150
00:46:38,056 --> 00:46:39,884
Oop. Whoa. There it is.

1151
00:46:39,927 --> 00:46:42,974
Oh, there's the phone!
Oh, she's got the phone.

1152
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,847
Hey, what's up?

1153
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:49,850
You've got to get Mark
away from the TV.

1154
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:50,851
He's been arrested.

1155
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:53,288
Oh, my god. Arrested?
Oh, my god.

1156
00:46:53,332 --> 00:46:54,768
Just listen to me, woman!

1157
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,161
Get him away from the TV!

1158
00:46:56,204 --> 00:46:58,293
The popular late night
talk show host,

1159
00:46:58,337 --> 00:47:02,167
famous for
making lewd comments
to Bridget bower,

1160
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,430
has been
bit by the love bug.

1161
00:47:04,473 --> 00:47:05,257
Oh! Oh!

1162
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,345
Make love to me.

1163
00:47:06,388 --> 00:47:07,781
Baby, what the fuck
did you just do?!

1164
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:08,913
No. No. Come here.

1165
00:47:08,956 --> 00:47:10,305
Why did you do that?

1166
00:47:10,349 --> 00:47:11,480
I don't know.

1167
00:47:11,524 --> 00:47:13,569
Are you
fucking insane?
The television!

1168
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:15,136
I know. Fuck me. Hmm?

1169
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:15,920
What?

1170
00:47:15,963 --> 00:47:17,051
I can't help it.Baby...

1171
00:47:17,095 --> 00:47:20,881
Love got me busted.
And her name is Lily.

1172
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:23,057
Hey, Lily.

1173
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:26,582
Anyway, New York's got
the best pizza in the world.

1174
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:30,978
Oh, Kevin.

1175
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:34,155
What'd you say?

1176
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:34,895
What?

1177
00:47:34,939 --> 00:47:36,723
You just said Kevin.

1178
00:47:37,463 --> 00:47:38,725
No, I did not.Yeah, you did.

1179
00:47:38,768 --> 00:47:40,379
No, I didn't.
I said Mark.

1180
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:43,251
How the fuck could
I mistake Kevin for Mark?

1181
00:47:43,295 --> 00:47:45,601
Nobody's Kevin.
Come on.

1182
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:47,125
You know what?
Forget it.

1183
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:50,955
I'm so over this.
I don't fucking care.

1184
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:54,610
Kevin?! Jesus, man.

1185
00:47:54,654 --> 00:47:55,742
Unbelievable.

1186
00:47:55,785 --> 00:47:57,526
Hi. What...What happened?
What'd they say?

1187
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:00,094
He's fucking
in love with you.

1188
00:48:00,138 --> 00:48:01,574
Oh, where's Mark?

1189
00:48:01,617 --> 00:48:04,403
Oh, my god.
He's in the bathroom.

1190
00:48:04,664 --> 00:48:07,493
Keith. Keith.
Keith. Keith!

1191
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:10,626
Barry, man.
What the hell?

1192
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:11,584
He's here.

1193
00:48:11,627 --> 00:48:13,064
Who's here?

1194
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:14,761
I'm talking
to Keith.
Go to sleep.

1195
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:15,675
Who's here?

1196
00:48:15,718 --> 00:48:16,763
Him.

1197
00:48:16,806 --> 00:48:17,764
Who's here?

1198
00:48:17,807 --> 00:48:18,634
Go to sleep!

1199
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:20,767
Pooch in the city.

1200
00:48:21,246 --> 00:48:22,812
Who's here?

1201
00:48:22,856 --> 00:48:24,553
Called Cindy.

1202
00:48:24,597 --> 00:48:26,512
She hasn't
called me
back yet.

1203
00:48:26,555 --> 00:48:29,776
Call again.
They love that.

1204
00:48:30,168 --> 00:48:32,822
That's a good
job, Nathan.
Go to sleep.

1205
00:48:32,866 --> 00:48:36,217
Oh, Nathan,
you've got to...

1206
00:48:36,826 --> 00:48:39,003
Hey, do not
talk to me like that!

1207
00:48:39,046 --> 00:48:40,961
Who the fuck
is Kevin?!

1208
00:48:41,005 --> 00:48:42,702
What are you eating?

1209
00:48:42,745 --> 00:48:44,878
I'm eating
wheat thins.

1210
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,445
Well, stop it!

1211
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:47,750
What?!

1212
00:48:47,794 --> 00:48:50,971
Those are my crackers!
I'm not kidding! Come on!

1213
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:54,714
You are fucking insane!

1214
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,064
What are...

1215
00:48:57,108 --> 00:48:58,892
Will you open
the fucking door?!

1216
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,330
No. You will not
talk to me
like that.

1217
00:49:02,374 --> 00:49:04,028
You're...Jesus Christ!

1218
00:49:04,071 --> 00:49:07,770
Your whole family
is fucking insane!

1219
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:10,382
God!

1220
00:49:10,425 --> 00:49:13,559
Hey, come on.
Give me a break, please.

1221
00:49:13,602 --> 00:49:15,648
Hey.
Hi. Yeah.

1222
00:49:15,691 --> 00:49:16,736
Thank you.

1223
00:49:16,779 --> 00:49:18,781
Hi. How ya doin'?

1224
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:20,566
So you, you...

1225
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:22,698
You hold the key
to the pooch
in the city.

1226
00:49:22,742 --> 00:49:25,919
Yes, I walk the dog.
That's what I do.

1227
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,138
How do I know?

1228
00:49:27,181 --> 00:49:29,792
I'm tellin' ya.

1229
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:30,576
Barry?

1230
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:31,707
How...how...
How do I know

1231
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:33,796
that it's
a pure bred
and not a mutt?

1232
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,408
It...it is a mutt.
It's a mix.

1233
00:49:36,451 --> 00:49:37,539
No, he...

1234
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:38,801
I think
what he means

1235
00:49:38,845 --> 00:49:39,846
is that how
do we know it's
Sarah Jessica's?

1236
00:49:39,889 --> 00:49:41,326
Sarah Jessica's?
No. No. No. Listen.

1237
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:43,371
I walk
Matthew Broderick's dog.
That's all I guarantee.

1238
00:49:43,415 --> 00:49:46,113
You guys wanna call it
Sarah Jessica's dog?
Go ahead.

1239
00:49:46,157 --> 00:49:47,114
Look, that's your deal.

1240
00:49:47,158 --> 00:49:49,682
Ok. 2,000
for the puppy.

1241
00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:50,900
Did you tell him
it was a puppy?

1242
00:49:50,944 --> 00:49:51,945
No, I said
it was a dog.

1243
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,642
Dog. Dog. Dog.

1244
00:49:53,686 --> 00:49:54,513
It's not a puppy.

1245
00:49:54,556 --> 00:49:56,602
Dog! Dog!
2,000 for the dog.

1246
00:49:56,645 --> 00:49:58,517
I mean, it's a dog.

1247
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,958
Hey, sugar.
Want a date?

1248
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,916
Thanks.
Nice shoes.

1249
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,006
Who are you?
I know you.

1250
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:11,486
Thanks for
watching the show.
Thank you.

1251
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,444
Thanks for
watching the show.

1252
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:15,490
Holy shit.
Kevin Michael moss.

1253
00:50:15,534 --> 00:50:16,535
Right.

1254
00:50:16,578 --> 00:50:17,840
Karen Malory.
Fourth period English.

1255
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:19,233
You don't remember?

1256
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:20,104
8.

1257
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:22,106
Look. Look.
Look in my eyes.

1258
00:50:22,149 --> 00:50:23,716
Ok.
I'm crazy.

1259
00:50:23,759 --> 00:50:25,196
He's crazy.
He's crazy.

1260
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:27,850
You know what's crazy?
I'm gonna lose my job.

1261
00:50:27,894 --> 00:50:29,461
Ok? 10.
8.

1262
00:50:29,504 --> 00:50:30,897
Please, tell him.
Please.

1263
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,768
Guys, I gotta
get back.
It's cold.

1264
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:33,987
8.

1265
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:34,901
How about 9?

1266
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:37,686
Barry. Barry.
Get it together.

1267
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:38,774
How about 9?

1268
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:41,516
8. I could buy
a Baldwin dog
for 10.

1269
00:50:42,082 --> 00:50:44,519
Mrs. Suchman's
class.

1270
00:50:44,563 --> 00:50:45,781
I remember.

1271
00:50:45,825 --> 00:50:46,826
There you go.

1272
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:49,959
You were 6 foot tall
in second grade.

1273
00:50:50,003 --> 00:50:51,091
I remember you.

1274
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:52,440
Fuckin' a.

1275
00:50:52,484 --> 00:50:54,573
We played
football together.
You tackled me once.

1276
00:50:54,616 --> 00:50:56,314
You almost
killed me.

1277
00:50:56,357 --> 00:50:57,315
I remember you.

1278
00:50:57,358 --> 00:50:58,968
Nice to see you.

1279
00:50:59,012 --> 00:50:59,839
Yeah.

1280
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:01,580
Good seeing you,
too, honey.

1281
00:51:09,892 --> 00:51:14,027
Look it.
Back to mess with
the bitch's brain.

1282
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,856
Why don't you
stop swinging
that dick around?

1283
00:51:16,899 --> 00:51:19,119
Poor Lily.

1284
00:51:19,424 --> 00:51:20,512
I didn't swing nothin'.

1285
00:51:20,555 --> 00:51:21,904
I haven't done a thing.

1286
00:51:21,948 --> 00:51:22,905
I haven't been
swinging anything.

1287
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:25,517
I haven't done
one thing wrong.

1288
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,260
You know her brother
went nuts.

1289
00:51:29,303 --> 00:51:30,348
I know the brother.

1290
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:32,872
Yeah, I know her brother.
I know him.

1291
00:51:32,915 --> 00:51:35,004
I brought him candy today.

1292
00:51:35,048 --> 00:51:36,963
I know all about him.
Believe me,

1293
00:51:37,006 --> 00:51:40,662
I know what I'm doing.
What I'm doing.

1294
00:51:40,706 --> 00:51:41,576
What's he doin'?

1295
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,101
I think he's
haggling with her.

1296
00:51:45,972 --> 00:51:47,713
Take some money.

1297
00:51:47,756 --> 00:51:49,323
If you're not
gonna let her be...

1298
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:51,151
And shut up.
Wait, look.
See how easy?

1299
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:53,327
I'm gonna pay you
to shut up.

1300
00:51:53,371 --> 00:51:55,155
Don't fuck
with the bitch,

1301
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:57,157
unless you fuck her
like a champion.

1302
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:58,115
Good hustle.

1303
00:51:58,158 --> 00:51:59,507
You're not gonna
make me shut up.

1304
00:51:59,551 --> 00:52:00,682
Take it. Here. $100.
And you don't insult me anymore.

1305
00:52:00,726 --> 00:52:01,944
Fuck you.
Fuck your money.

1306
00:52:01,988 --> 00:52:03,207
Shove it up
your fucking ass.

1307
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,992
All you have to do
is shut your big, fat mouth.

1308
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:07,124
She's a good girl.

1309
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:08,299
Remember big Karen?

1310
00:52:08,342 --> 00:52:09,430
Big Karen now grew up
and has a big mouth.

1311
00:52:09,474 --> 00:52:10,997
Scrawny
motherfucker.
Scrawny Bobby.

1312
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,129
Here, take the money.

1313
00:52:12,172 --> 00:52:13,217
Fuck you!

1314
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,348
Yes, I did.
I screwed
Bobby bishop.

1315
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:15,567
I gave him
a blowjob.
Yes, I did.

1316
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:18,570
My name is Sundey,
with an "e".

1317
00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:23,227
Hey, Marco Polo.

1318
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:24,097
Hey.

1319
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,011
What's the matter
with you?

1320
00:52:25,054 --> 00:52:26,273
Why do you
look so sad?

1321
00:52:26,317 --> 00:52:27,013
I'm not sad.

1322
00:52:27,056 --> 00:52:28,536
It's such
a good song.

1323
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,451
It is a good song.

1324
00:52:30,495 --> 00:52:32,540
You wanna have
a drink with me?

1325
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:34,151
Sure.

1326
00:52:34,194 --> 00:52:36,065
Bradley? Can we
have another...

1327
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:37,110
Cosmo.

1328
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,938
Cosmopolitan for
sad sack over here.

1329
00:52:38,981 --> 00:52:40,461
I am not sad.

1330
00:52:40,505 --> 00:52:43,247
You look sad.
Come on. Cheer up.

1331
00:53:02,135 --> 00:53:04,050
Oh, my...

1332
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:07,184
Oh.

1333
00:53:07,445 --> 00:53:10,622
Come on.
Just do it. Do it.

1334
00:53:10,665 --> 00:53:11,579
I don't feel good.

1335
00:53:11,623 --> 00:53:12,667
You'll feel better.

1336
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:14,103
I haven't worked out
in, like, a week.

1337
00:53:14,147 --> 00:53:15,279
You look good to me.

1338
00:53:15,322 --> 00:53:18,282
I'm totally bloated.
My stomach is, like...

1339
00:53:18,325 --> 00:53:21,285
I'm, like, chubby.

1340
00:53:21,328 --> 00:53:22,503
I am. Stop.

1341
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:25,985
Come on.
Let the music
free your soul.

1342
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:26,986
Ok? Come on!

1343
00:53:27,029 --> 00:53:27,769
I'm too fat.

1344
00:53:27,813 --> 00:53:29,249
Come on, bitch.
Get up.

1345
00:53:29,293 --> 00:53:30,642
Let's work.
Right now.

1346
00:53:30,685 --> 00:53:33,993
Off your chair.
On the bar.
Do your dance.

1347
00:53:34,036 --> 00:53:35,124
No.
Come on.

1348
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,259
Hello?

1349
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:42,088
Hey. You got
fucking arrested. Genius.

1350
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:45,918
Yes, a ladies room.
Big fucking deal.

1351
00:53:50,749 --> 00:53:52,490
What the fuck am I doing?

1352
00:53:52,533 --> 00:53:53,578
What am I doing?

1353
00:53:53,621 --> 00:53:55,188
God, I swear so much
these days.

1354
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,104
Hey, uh, listen. Variety
loved the "I wanna
fuck you" bit.

1355
00:53:58,147 --> 00:54:00,933
Yeah, we got 'em
by the balls.

1356
00:54:00,976 --> 00:54:03,065
We're a hit.

1357
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:04,806
We're...

1358
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:05,938
We're a hit.

1359
00:54:05,981 --> 00:54:08,157

1361
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:09,811
You're going live.

00:54:09,855 --> 00:54:10,682

Ok? She knows it.
It's over.

Why?! Why?!

1399
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:01,009
Because you're the only one
who can disappear?

1400
00:56:01,053 --> 00:56:04,056
You are in my fucking
living room 5 nights a week.

1401
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:06,058
Don't talk to me
about disappearing.

1402
00:56:06,101 --> 00:56:09,670
4 nights.
We repeated
on Monday.

1403
00:56:09,714 --> 00:56:11,585
I know that, because
I even watched that.

1404
00:56:11,629 --> 00:56:13,761
That's how fucking
pathetic I am.

1405
00:56:13,805 --> 00:56:15,197
The show's good.

1406
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:16,373
The least you can do,

1407
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:18,636
if you're gonna leave me,
is leave me.

1408
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:21,116
You don't have to become
a part of pop culture!

1409
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,858
In my fucking living room
5 nights a week!

1410
00:56:23,902 --> 00:56:26,208
Excuse me.
Excuse me for
being successful.

1411
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:28,385
That's what I did.

1412
00:56:29,037 --> 00:56:32,824
I've become a part
of pop culture. Lily!

00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:38,569
One of those birthdays

A midnight with Bobby bishop

Listen, cut it out.
Cut it out.

1421
00:56:49,275 --> 00:56:50,668
Cut it out?

1422
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:52,147
Cut it out.
What kind of jerk
would give a mug for...

1423
00:56:52,191 --> 00:56:54,889
This is lighter.
Hey, you know what this is?

1424
00:56:54,933 --> 00:56:56,021
Won't hurt ya!

1425
00:56:56,064 --> 00:56:58,240
That is a beach towel.
Not a normal one.

1426
00:56:58,284 --> 00:57:00,634
A Bobby bishop beach towel.

1427
00:57:00,678 --> 00:57:02,506
I didn't even know
we made these.

1428
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:03,507
Well, you do.
You make 'em.

1429
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:04,899
And guess what?
I loved it!

1430
00:57:04,943 --> 00:57:06,684
I loved it when my cousin
Jenny goes to California.

1431
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:09,208
"Oh, we saw
the Bobby bishop show.

1432
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:10,209
He's so cute!"

1433
00:57:10,252 --> 00:57:12,516
All right. Lily...
Fuck you!

1434
00:57:12,777 --> 00:57:15,170
Hey, come on.
I'm sorry.

1435
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:16,345
Come on downstairs.

1436
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:17,564
You're waking up
the whole
neighborhood.

1437
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:19,261
I don't give a fuck
about the neighborhood.

1438
00:57:19,305 --> 00:57:20,306
For once...

1439
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:21,568
When did you get
this new vocabulary?

1440
00:57:21,612 --> 00:57:23,309
You know where it's from?
Where did I get it?

1441
00:57:23,352 --> 00:57:24,528
My new attitude?
What the fuck?

1442
00:57:24,571 --> 00:57:25,964
You never
said things
like that, ever.

1443
00:57:26,007 --> 00:57:29,489
I never had the opportunity
to say it to you before

1444
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:30,534
because you left!

1445
00:57:30,577 --> 00:57:31,883
Do you have any idea
what it's like?

1446
00:57:31,926 --> 00:57:34,625
Do you know what it's like
to be in a relationship,

1447
00:57:34,668 --> 00:57:37,889
to live with someone,
and not be able to tell them

1448
00:57:37,932 --> 00:57:41,370
that the guy on channel 7
is your boyfriend?

1449
00:57:41,414 --> 00:57:42,459
That is your ex-boyfriend?

1450
00:57:42,502 --> 00:57:43,503
Do you know
what that's like?

1451
00:57:43,547 --> 00:57:45,287
I'm like a fucking...
I'm a spectacle.

1452
00:57:45,331 --> 00:57:47,159
I'm an idiot!
I'm a loser!

1453
00:57:47,202 --> 00:57:49,248
You're not a loser.
What are you...

1454
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:51,685
Come on! I did
everything for you!

1455
00:57:51,729 --> 00:57:53,948
I helped you!
I loved you!

1456
00:57:53,992 --> 00:57:55,559
I loved you, too.
We were a couple.

1457
00:57:55,602 --> 00:57:57,212
I thought
you were funny.

1458
00:57:57,256 --> 00:57:58,257
I am funny.

1459
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,519
I rearranged
my living room furniture

1460
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:00,651
so we could play talk show.

1461
00:58:00,694 --> 00:58:02,827
You know? I'll be ed,
and you be Johnny.

1462
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:05,612
I was a better Johnny.
You tried Johnny once,
you were terrible.

1463
00:58:05,656 --> 00:58:08,485
No, you weren't funny
as Johnny! You weren't!

1464
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:09,355
Johnny wasn't...

1465
00:58:09,398 --> 00:58:11,183
Hey, guess what?
I was funny!

1466
00:58:11,226 --> 00:58:13,098
I don't remember you
ever being funny.

1467
00:58:13,141 --> 00:58:15,230
No offense, but you
were not that funny.

1468
00:58:15,274 --> 00:58:17,581
You were fun,
but you were not
that funny.

1469
00:58:17,624 --> 00:58:20,148
Ok? Now,
will you come down
and let's talk?

1470
00:58:20,192 --> 00:58:21,759
You know what
wasn't funny?

1471
00:58:21,802 --> 00:58:23,891
What?

1472
00:58:23,935 --> 00:58:26,111
Don't bring that up.

1473
00:58:26,154 --> 00:58:27,329
I wasn't going to
bring it up.

1474
00:58:27,373 --> 00:58:28,505
I don't wanna
talk about that
now, please.

1475
00:58:28,548 --> 00:58:29,941
I know, it must
be painful for you

1476
00:58:29,984 --> 00:58:32,378
to send me a fucking check.
That must have been hard.

1477
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:34,902
You think I had
no feelings about that?

1478
00:58:34,946 --> 00:58:37,514
You think I had feelings
when I read

1479
00:58:37,557 --> 00:58:39,167
that you're
dating Sheryl crow?

1480
00:58:39,211 --> 00:58:40,429
I can't believe this.

1481
00:58:40,473 --> 00:58:43,694
I can't believe we're
arguing about a tabloid.

1482
00:58:43,737 --> 00:58:44,738
I never met Sheryl crow.

1483
00:58:44,782 --> 00:58:47,524
You fucked me up
when you got famous!

1484
00:58:51,005 --> 00:58:53,181
I'm gay.

1485
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:55,662
No shit!

1486
00:58:56,663 --> 00:58:57,621
I'm Bobby.

1487
00:58:57,664 --> 00:58:59,361
Yeah, I know
who you are.

1488
00:58:59,405 --> 00:59:00,188
Don't shake his...

1489
00:59:00,232 --> 00:59:02,060
But I didn't
know who you...

1490
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:03,365
Who is this?

1491
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:05,367
I hate your fucking
show by the way.
It sucks.

1492
00:59:05,411 --> 00:59:06,586
Who is this?!

1493
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:08,022
This is riff.I'm gay, too.

1494
00:59:08,066 --> 00:59:10,198
Riff?!
Who is this,
I'd like to know?

1495
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:12,592
You know exactly
who that is!
I'm Bobby.

1496
00:59:12,636 --> 00:59:13,680
I love
your show.

1497
00:59:13,724 --> 00:59:15,552
Who is he?
I don't understand?

1498
00:59:15,595 --> 00:59:17,249
Who's your fucking
little friend?

1499
00:59:17,292 --> 00:59:19,381
Is that your boyfriend,
is that your affair,
is that your lover?

1500
00:59:19,425 --> 00:59:21,340
He's a friend
of mine, ok?

1501
00:59:21,383 --> 00:59:23,298
We're just having
fun, that's all. Ok?

1502
00:59:23,342 --> 00:59:24,561
That Bridget bower
is a slut.

1503
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:27,041
Would you shut up
about Bridget bower?

1504
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:27,912
Thanks.

1505
00:59:27,955 --> 00:59:29,000
Oh, "thanks."
Bobby, shut...

1506
00:59:29,043 --> 00:59:30,610
All right, you didn't
have any idea

1507
00:59:30,654 --> 00:59:32,786
about what was
going on? I mean,
come on, be honest.

1508
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:35,310
No, I didn't.
I thought you were
kind of strange,

1509
00:59:35,354 --> 00:59:36,224
but, no, I didn't.

1510
00:59:36,268 --> 00:59:37,704
Hey, maybe
you're strange, ok?

1511
00:59:37,748 --> 00:59:40,620
Hey, maybe you should
shut the fuck up!

1512
00:59:40,664 --> 00:59:42,100
Shut up!

1513
00:59:42,143 --> 00:59:44,972
What is this?
What is
your life?

1514
00:59:45,016 --> 00:59:46,452
You know what,
you know, I'll...

1515
00:59:46,495 --> 00:59:48,672
I'll just come back
next week, and I'll
get my stuff.

1516
00:59:48,715 --> 00:59:49,890
Come back and get
your fucking cock rings.

1517
00:59:49,934 --> 00:59:51,718
Look what you did,
you asshole!

1518
00:59:51,762 --> 00:59:55,766
What I did?
I made them gay?

1519
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:57,724
Lily? Lily?

1520
00:59:57,768 --> 01:00:01,293
I'm kidding.

1521
01:00:04,383 --> 01:00:06,907
Read my speech.

1522
01:00:07,778 --> 01:00:10,084
"I'm here,
and I'm not leaving.

1523
01:00:10,128 --> 01:00:11,782
"I want to be
a whole person.

1524
01:00:11,825 --> 01:00:15,655
"With you, I was
a whole person.

1525
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:19,746
"I was stupid,
but I was whole.

1526
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,748
"I'm not going.

1527
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:24,055
I'm smarter now."

1528
01:00:24,098 --> 01:00:27,580
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake, Lily.

1529
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:31,628
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake.

1530
01:00:32,672 --> 01:00:34,326
It's my girlfriend's
house.

1531
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:35,806
Let's go, Romeo.

1532
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:36,807
It's my girlfriend's house.

1533
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:39,636
We're just having
a conversation.

1534
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:41,028
She's up there. Lily!

1535
01:00:41,072 --> 01:00:43,770
Step over
to the car.

1536
01:00:43,814 --> 01:00:45,772
Lily!

1537
01:00:45,816 --> 01:00:47,339
Damn.

1538
01:00:47,382 --> 01:00:48,645
Come on, come on, guys.

1539
01:00:48,688 --> 01:00:49,646
It's my girlfriend's
house.

1540
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:52,387
Come on,
inside the car.

1541
01:00:52,431 --> 01:00:54,738
Lily!

1542
01:00:55,695 --> 01:00:59,699
I'm sick. I'm sick
with love. Lily!

1543
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:02,267
Get well soon.

1544
01:01:03,224 --> 01:01:06,837
Lily! Lily!

1545
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,882
Lily!

1546
01:01:25,725 --> 01:01:28,467
God bless him.

1547
01:01:31,035 --> 01:01:32,558
Anybody home?

1548
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:35,126
Mmhh. No.

1549
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:37,694
Check this out.

1550
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:43,874
The hooker's cute, huh?

1551
01:01:47,442 --> 01:01:48,879
Mom, it's me!

1552
01:01:48,922 --> 01:01:50,141
Who's me?

1553
01:01:50,184 --> 01:01:54,275
Me! Your...Mom, come on,
open the door.

1554
01:01:57,757 --> 01:01:59,237
Hey.

1555
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,675
Mom...hey, hey,
what happened?

1556
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,721
Mom?

1557
01:02:04,764 --> 01:02:06,810
What are you doing?

1558
01:02:06,853 --> 01:02:08,855
Hey!

1559
01:02:08,899 --> 01:02:10,161
Mom, what are
you doing?

1560
01:02:10,204 --> 01:02:11,771
What you do mean
what am I doing?

1561
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:14,731
Sit down. I'm tired.

1562
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:15,775
Hey...

1563
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:17,646
What?
Oh, my god.

1564
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:18,778
My roots, I know,
my roots.

1565
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,301
No, mom,
what happened
to your face?

1566
01:02:20,345 --> 01:02:24,479
Nothing, nothing.
I...I slipped in the tub.

1567
01:02:24,523 --> 01:02:25,567
Oh, that is
bullshit, mother.

1568
01:02:25,611 --> 01:02:26,743
Come on, we're gonna
go to Lenox Hill.

1569
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:28,483
No, I don't want
to go to the hospital.

1570
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:29,746
Mom, I mean it...

1571
01:02:29,789 --> 01:02:31,748
Nooo!

1572
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:34,881
Ok, ok.
No.

1573
01:02:34,925 --> 01:02:37,405
Ok.

1574
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:38,842
All right, mom.

1575
01:02:38,885 --> 01:02:41,932
It's ok, I'm sorry.

1576
01:02:43,977 --> 01:02:46,284
Ok.

1577
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:49,766
Sorry.

1578
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:52,203
I'm gonna get you
a diet Pepsi, ok?

1579
01:02:52,246 --> 01:02:54,640
Yeah. No ice.

1580
01:02:54,683 --> 01:02:55,859
No ice.

1581
01:02:55,902 --> 01:02:57,251
Here,
why don't you...

1582
01:02:57,295 --> 01:03:00,211
Why don't you
have a cigarette?

1583
01:03:00,254 --> 01:03:01,821
I lost my lighter.

1584
01:03:01,865 --> 01:03:04,824
No, no, no,
I have it.

1585
01:03:06,434 --> 01:03:08,872
Here you go.

1586
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:22,537
I did not touch her.

1587
01:03:24,017 --> 01:03:27,020
What's my horoscope?

1588
01:03:28,369 --> 01:03:29,762
You did a good job.

1589
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:30,632
Thank you.

1590
01:03:30,676 --> 01:03:32,112
You're
the best manager

1591
01:03:32,156 --> 01:03:34,419
a bum like me
could've ever
hoped for, Mitch.

1592
01:03:34,462 --> 01:03:35,855
All right, stop now.
Come on.

1593
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:37,335
Who's
our first guest?

1594
01:03:37,378 --> 01:03:40,120
Matthew Broderick.

1595
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:44,603
Don't start.

1596
01:03:44,646 --> 01:03:46,300
He's a fine actor,

1597
01:03:46,344 --> 01:03:48,259
a fine actor.

1598
01:03:48,302 --> 01:03:50,739
It'll be fine.
You did a good job.

1599
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,784
Thank you.

1600
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:52,916
Ok, can we go,
can we go?
Can we go?

1601
01:03:52,959 --> 01:03:56,615
Mom, what happened
to your little
protector?

1602
01:03:56,658 --> 01:03:58,051
Arthur?
Yeah.

1603
01:03:58,095 --> 01:03:59,270
He left.

1604
01:03:59,313 --> 01:04:00,271
What do you mean
he left?

1605
01:04:00,314 --> 01:04:02,577
Left, gone.
They never come back.

1606
01:04:02,621 --> 01:04:04,231
Oh, my god...

1607
01:04:04,275 --> 01:04:05,624
Did you have sex
with this guy?

1608
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:06,886
Give me
another cigarette.

1609
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,670
No! Mom, look at me,
look at me.

1610
01:04:08,714 --> 01:04:10,847
Did you have sex
with him? No, no!

1611
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,805
Where? Here?

1612
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:13,719
No.
Where!

1613
01:04:13,762 --> 01:04:16,940
In the park.
It was beautiful.

1614
01:04:16,983 --> 01:04:19,507
Mom, you could've
been murdered.

1615
01:04:19,551 --> 01:04:20,987
Linda, you could
have aids.

1616
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:24,077
Oh, stop it, will you?
Arthur was good.

1617
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:25,078
We used a glove.

1618
01:04:25,122 --> 01:04:27,515
I'm gonna take you
to the hospital.

1619
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:28,865
A glove?

1620
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:32,085
Ok.

1621
01:04:32,129 --> 01:04:33,434
Ahem.

1622
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:35,045
Yeah.

1623
01:04:35,088 --> 01:04:38,004
Starbursts.

1624
01:04:38,048 --> 01:04:41,660
Uh...lots of 'em.

1625
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:45,272
Over and out.

1626
01:04:54,325 --> 01:04:57,328
Ok, around 4:00
or 5:00.

1627
01:04:57,371 --> 01:05:00,070
All right,
thank you.

1628
01:05:03,334 --> 01:05:04,944
Everything cool?

1629
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:07,599
Yeah.

1630
01:05:07,642 --> 01:05:11,168
Hey, mom,
you want a bagel?

1631
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:12,996
No, honey.

1632
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:14,780
You know, I really
should run over

1633
01:05:14,823 --> 01:05:18,436
to St. Paul's before
I miss out on grub.

1634
01:05:18,479 --> 01:05:22,570
Heh. Nobody says
grub anymore,
mom.

1635
01:05:22,614 --> 01:05:25,269
What is grub?

1636
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:33,103
Hey, how you doing?

1637
01:05:33,146 --> 01:05:35,105
What are you looking at?

1638
01:05:35,148 --> 01:05:37,803
Did you really
blow that hooker?

1639
01:05:37,846 --> 01:05:38,978
No.
No?

1640
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:40,284
No.
No?

1641
01:05:40,327 --> 01:05:43,026
No! You would believe
that I would do that?

1642
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:44,723
No, I did not,
I did not,

1643
01:05:44,766 --> 01:05:47,030
I did not blow her,
and she did not blow me.

1644
01:05:47,073 --> 01:05:49,989
We didn't blow each other.
No blowing.

1645
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:53,427
She was...
No, I don't do that.

1646
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:54,863
I'm not like that.

1647
01:05:54,907 --> 01:05:56,082
Ok.
Ugh.

1648
01:05:56,126 --> 01:05:57,040
Good man.

1649
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:59,129
All right, here.
I got the stuff.

1650
01:05:59,172 --> 01:06:00,913
Oh, yeah.
Got the stuff.

1651
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,524
Did I come through?Thanks.

1652
01:06:03,568 --> 01:06:05,962
Did you ever see bag
that big of that stuff?

1653
01:06:06,005 --> 01:06:07,615
Look, uh...

1654
01:06:07,659 --> 01:06:11,271
There's somebody
that I'd like you
to say hello to.

1655
01:06:11,315 --> 01:06:14,448
Come on, Keith.
I got a lot on my mind.

1656
01:06:14,492 --> 01:06:16,624
Just...just
for a second.

1657
01:06:16,668 --> 01:06:17,886
It'd be
a big thrill.

1658
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:20,628
I do this all the time,
I hate it, I hate it.

1659
01:06:20,672 --> 01:06:22,804
That's what everybody says,
they say the same thing.

1660
01:06:22,848 --> 01:06:25,111
"It's just
this one person."

1661
01:06:25,155 --> 01:06:26,069
Bob, come on!

1662
01:06:26,112 --> 01:06:27,766
"It would mean
so much to them."

1663
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:29,376
One person. One person.

1664
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:33,554
Yeah, ok, great.
Hold on.

1665
01:06:33,598 --> 01:06:35,992
Ugh.

1666
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:44,913
Bobby bishop...
Bobby bishop.

1667
01:06:44,957 --> 01:06:46,089
How you doing?
What's your name?

1668
01:06:46,132 --> 01:06:47,394
What's your name?

1669
01:06:47,438 --> 01:06:48,656
What's your name?

1670
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,094
What's your name?

1671
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,444
What's your name?What's your name?

1672
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:54,923
I'm Bobby bishop.

1673
01:06:54,967 --> 01:06:56,490
I'm Bobby bishop.

1674
01:06:56,534 --> 01:06:58,188
Who is this guy?Who is this guy?

1675
01:06:58,231 --> 01:06:59,928
I don't get it.I don't get it.

1676
01:06:59,972 --> 01:07:02,801
He thinks he's you.
Say hi.

1677
01:07:02,844 --> 01:07:05,195
Oh, I see.
He thinks he's me.

1678
01:07:05,238 --> 01:07:07,153
All right, enough.All right, enough.

1679
01:07:07,197 --> 01:07:08,676
Cut it out.Cut it out.

1680
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,287
Anyway, nice to meet
you. Bobby bishop.

1681
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:11,853
Nice to meet you.Nice to meet you.

1682
01:07:11,897 --> 01:07:13,029
Thanks for watching
the show.

1683
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:16,162
Cut it out.Cut it out.

1684
01:07:16,206 --> 01:07:17,642
Cut it out.Cut it out.

1685
01:07:17,685 --> 01:07:19,992
All right, enough,
I get it, I get it.

1686
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,125
I said I got it. Keith?

1687
01:07:22,168 --> 01:07:23,169
Keith?

1688
01:07:23,213 --> 01:07:27,782
Ok, we met. Good-bye.
Whuu!
Whuu!

1689
01:07:28,522 --> 01:07:31,047
Ahh! Get rid of him.Get rid of him.

1690
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:32,396
Get him out of here.Get him out of here.

1691
01:07:32,439 --> 01:07:34,572
Get him out of here. Get him out of here.

1692
01:07:34,615 --> 01:07:35,660
Cut it out!
Cut it out.

1693
01:07:35,703 --> 01:07:37,270
All right, enough.
I get the joke.

1694
01:07:37,314 --> 01:07:39,751
Go, go away!

1695
01:07:39,794 --> 01:07:41,057
Thank you. Good night,
thank you.

1696
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:44,016
Keith, get him out of here.
Get out of my sight,

1697
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,411
you fucking nut.
Heh heh.

1698
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:51,241
Keith, I mean,
come on.
Thank you.

1699
01:07:51,284 --> 01:07:53,982
What was that?
Some wacko?
Thank you.

1700
01:07:54,026 --> 01:07:56,159
Ok, the guy's
a fucking nut.

1701
01:07:56,202 --> 01:07:58,596
No. Nooo!

1702
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:00,337
No! No way!

1703
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:02,469
No fucking way!

1704
01:08:02,513 --> 01:08:04,906
Why is everybody
yelling?

1705
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:07,039
Lily, you're doing
everything right.

1706
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,825
It doesn't feel like
it, but you are.

1707
01:08:10,869 --> 01:08:13,480
Ok. How are my eyes?

1708
01:08:13,524 --> 01:08:15,308
You're beautiful.

1709
01:08:15,352 --> 01:08:16,440
They're fine.

1710
01:08:16,483 --> 01:08:19,921
Here,
blow your nose.

1711
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:24,535
Ok. Ok.

1712
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:26,580
I'm...I'm gonna go
see Keith.

1713
01:08:26,624 --> 01:08:27,625
Ok, I'll wait.

1714
01:08:27,668 --> 01:08:29,714
I don't care if his dog
is missing.

1715
01:08:29,757 --> 01:08:30,758
What do I care?
Hey, listen,

1716
01:08:30,802 --> 01:08:32,586
he promised
to do the show,

1717
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:35,459
he is doing
the fucking show!

1718
01:08:35,502 --> 01:08:36,721
No.

1719
01:08:36,764 --> 01:08:39,724
No. I don't care
if his dog is dead.

1720
01:08:39,767 --> 01:08:40,812
How do you like that?

1721
01:08:40,855 --> 01:08:42,074
"I'm gay. I'm gay."

1722
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,641
And he's got lipstick
on and the whole thing,

1723
01:08:43,684 --> 01:08:45,121
and it was Mark,
it was him.

1724
01:08:45,164 --> 01:08:46,731
"I'm gay?"

1725
01:08:46,774 --> 01:08:47,819
Lily's dating gay.

1726
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:50,126
The little one loved me.
Mark hated me.

1727
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:52,606
Woof.
Real gay.

1728
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:55,043
Hey, Keith,
your sister's here.

1729
01:08:55,087 --> 01:08:56,697
Woof!

1730
01:08:56,741 --> 01:08:58,699
Keith, I'm not here,
I'm not here.

1731
01:08:58,743 --> 01:09:02,399
Right. Yes.

1732
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:04,966
Bring her in.

1733
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:14,759
Excuse me.
That's my guy.

1734
01:09:15,716 --> 01:09:18,937
Bobby.
You watch television?

1735
01:09:21,983 --> 01:09:26,292
Do you watch television?
That's my...That's
Bobby bishop.

1736
01:09:26,336 --> 01:09:28,251
Late night with...
Mm-hmm.

1737
01:09:28,294 --> 01:09:30,644
Do you do film?
Because you have

1738
01:09:30,688 --> 01:09:32,951
a beautiful structure
to your face.

1739
01:09:32,994 --> 01:09:35,171
A struc...

1740
01:09:35,214 --> 01:09:36,607
What's wrong with you?

1741
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:37,434
You...you...

1742
01:09:37,477 --> 01:09:41,742
Just...get out
of my face.

1743
01:09:41,786 --> 01:09:43,135
Asshole.

1744
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,441
Hey, go fuck yourself,
you know?

1745
01:09:44,484 --> 01:09:46,660
I'm just trying to make,
you know, conversation.

1746
01:09:46,704 --> 01:09:48,836
Go fuck...Go fuck
yourself.

1747
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,664
I don't need
that shit.

1748
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:52,318
When was he here?

1749
01:09:52,362 --> 01:09:53,885
The other day.

1750
01:09:53,928 --> 01:09:57,062
I don't want to
talk about him.

1751
01:09:59,673 --> 01:10:01,545
Did you see
the paper?
Yeah.

1752
01:10:01,588 --> 01:10:04,504
I don't want to
talk about it.

1753
01:10:05,549 --> 01:10:07,855
Look, Lily...

1754
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:09,596
He didn't do that.

1755
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,859
What?
The paper.

1756
01:10:11,903 --> 01:10:14,166
Lily, he wouldn't
do that.

1757
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,820
I don't know that.

1758
01:10:15,863 --> 01:10:17,256
Look, he's crazy,

1759
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:20,085
but I told you
it was a sign.

1760
01:10:20,128 --> 01:10:23,480
No, having a breakdown
on TV is not a sign.

1761
01:10:23,523 --> 01:10:25,743
Lily...
Hmm?

1762
01:10:25,786 --> 01:10:26,874
He loves you.

1763
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:28,789
No, he loves Bobby.

1764
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:31,705
No, he loves you.

1765
01:10:32,489 --> 01:10:34,578
And you love him.

1766
01:10:34,621 --> 01:10:36,797
I can see it.

1767
01:10:36,841 --> 01:10:37,798
You cannot.

1768
01:10:37,842 --> 01:10:39,844
Lily, Bobby's been
here for 2 days,

1769
01:10:39,887 --> 01:10:43,239
and you look
totally different.

1770
01:10:44,762 --> 01:10:45,850
I do?

1771
01:10:45,893 --> 01:10:48,244
Your eyes,
for the first time
in years,

1772
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:50,376
they sparkle.

1773
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:54,075
You deserve to be
loved, Lily.

1774
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:57,557
Really loved.

1775
01:11:00,473 --> 01:11:02,954
I don't know.

1776
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:06,479
I don't know.

1777
01:11:06,523 --> 01:11:07,393
I'm out there,

1778
01:11:07,437 --> 01:11:10,788
and it is weird,
and it's hard.

1779
01:11:10,831 --> 01:11:11,658
I know.

1780
01:11:11,702 --> 01:11:13,486
No, no, no,
you don't know.

1781
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:16,184
I remember.

1782
01:11:17,534 --> 01:11:18,535
Bobby's out there.

1783
01:11:18,578 --> 01:11:20,885
No, no, no, Bobby
is not out there.

1784
01:11:20,928 --> 01:11:22,756
Bobby is in TV land.

1785
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,237
I don't have people.

1786
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:28,501
I don't have...I can't...

1787
01:11:28,545 --> 01:11:30,198
Run a repeat
of last Tuesday

1788
01:11:30,242 --> 01:11:31,461
if I can't handle
this one.

1789
01:11:31,504 --> 01:11:33,985
I don't have shrinks,
I don't have handlers.

1790
01:11:34,028 --> 01:11:35,334
I can't go searching
for some girl

1791
01:11:35,378 --> 01:11:37,293
that I used to know
out of the blue.

1792
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:39,643
I mean, I'm alone.

1793
01:11:39,686 --> 01:11:41,209
I worry about me.

1794
01:11:41,253 --> 01:11:46,258
And between you
and Linda and Mark...

1795
01:11:48,913 --> 01:11:52,873
And then all of a sudden,
Bobby bishop.

1796
01:11:54,832 --> 01:11:57,138
God.

1797
01:11:57,182 --> 01:11:58,183
I'm sorry.

1798
01:11:58,226 --> 01:12:01,273
No, don't be sorry,
don't be sorry.

1799
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:05,059
Just please don't
tell me that it's easy.

1800
01:12:05,103 --> 01:12:06,060
Ok?

1801
01:12:06,104 --> 01:12:08,411
And that goes for you,
too, moron.

1802
01:12:08,454 --> 01:12:10,151
I should take
your starbursts back.

1803
01:12:10,195 --> 01:12:11,327
No, no!

1804
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,371
Lily, Lily!

1805
01:12:12,415 --> 01:12:13,938
No, no! Fuck you!
Fuck both of you.

1806
01:12:13,981 --> 01:12:16,201
Keith, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean it with you.

1807
01:12:16,244 --> 01:12:18,595
You, I mean it!
Fuck you!

1808
01:12:18,638 --> 01:12:19,726
Hey, Lily.

1809
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:21,902
No, no, see, I'm not
some Hollywood diva.

1810
01:12:21,946 --> 01:12:22,860
I know, I know.

1811
01:12:22,903 --> 01:12:24,731
I'm a real
fucking person.

1812
01:12:24,775 --> 01:12:25,993
I do my own hair!

1813
01:12:26,037 --> 01:12:26,994
I like your hair.

1814
01:12:27,038 --> 01:12:29,040
Yeah, your hair
looks good. You...

1815
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:30,520
Stop it!

1816
01:12:30,563 --> 01:12:34,132
The world does not
revolve around you
when you're in it!

1817
01:12:34,175 --> 01:12:36,526
What's that mean?

1818
01:12:36,569 --> 01:12:40,617
I don't think
the world revolves
around me.

1819
01:12:41,052 --> 01:12:44,795
She looks good.
She looked good.

1820
01:12:44,838 --> 01:12:46,144
Let's go.
What's wrong?

1821
01:12:46,187 --> 01:12:47,188
I just got ambushed.

1822
01:12:47,232 --> 01:12:49,974
Oh, don't read
the paper today.

1823
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:03,727
Shit!

1824
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:06,991
Ugh!

1825
01:13:07,818 --> 01:13:10,864
Kitten? What happened?

1826
01:13:10,908 --> 01:13:13,258
Just leave me alone!
Damn.

1827
01:13:13,301 --> 01:13:14,781
I just banged
my head.

1828
01:13:14,825 --> 01:13:16,479
Let's go
do the show.

1829
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:19,612
Let's do
the show.

1830
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:25,923
There you go.
Yes, sir!

1831
01:13:25,966 --> 01:13:27,881
Wow, wow, wow!

1832
01:13:27,925 --> 01:13:29,840
Look at this!

1833
01:13:29,883 --> 01:13:32,408
Killer! Rebirth!

1834
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,501
It's just TV, Mitch.

1835
01:13:38,544 --> 01:13:39,850
That's what
I'm talking about.

1836
01:13:39,893 --> 01:13:44,898
I'm talking about TV.
I'm talking about big show!

1837
01:13:45,377 --> 01:13:48,772
What happened
to Broderick's dog?

1838
01:13:48,815 --> 01:13:50,948
Broderick's dog.
That's important.

1839
01:13:50,991 --> 01:13:52,471
To me.
I'm on that.

1840
01:13:52,515 --> 01:13:53,864
Get on it, Mitch.

1841
01:13:53,907 --> 01:13:56,083
I'm...

1842
01:13:57,955 --> 01:14:01,001
Where you going now,
killer?

1843
01:14:04,352 --> 01:14:06,224
Hi, Linda.

1844
01:14:06,267 --> 01:14:09,140
Hiya, honey.

1845
01:14:12,404 --> 01:14:14,145
It's good to see you.

1846
01:14:14,188 --> 01:14:16,843
Yeah.

1847
01:14:16,887 --> 01:14:19,193
How's the vibe?

1848
01:14:19,237 --> 01:14:20,847
Not too bad.

1849
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:22,675
Good.

1850
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:24,460
Good.

1851
01:14:24,503 --> 01:14:26,026
Listen, Keith,

1852
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:29,073
I don't want...

1853
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:30,857
What?

1854
01:14:30,901 --> 01:14:32,946
To cramp your style.

1855
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:37,081
Heh! You're not gonna
cramp my style.

1856
01:14:37,124 --> 01:14:40,737
Well, you know,
I know you have
a girlfriend.

1857
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:43,740
Mom, I don't have
a girlfriend.

1858
01:14:43,783 --> 01:14:45,916
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah.

1859
01:14:45,959 --> 01:14:47,657
Your special friend.

1860
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:51,748
Mom, I don't have
a special friend.

1861
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:53,532
It's only natural,
you know,

1862
01:14:53,576 --> 01:14:56,100
that a mother
would want to meet

1863
01:14:56,143 --> 01:14:58,276
her son's gal.

1864
01:14:58,319 --> 01:14:59,756
And I'm sure this...

1865
01:14:59,799 --> 01:15:02,454
This little
Sarah Jessica
would like to meet

1866
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:05,152
the mother
of her Beau.

1867
01:15:05,196 --> 01:15:07,938
Mom...

1868
01:15:10,114 --> 01:15:14,031
Sarah Jessica and I...

1869
01:15:14,074 --> 01:15:15,380
Broke up.

1870
01:15:15,423 --> 01:15:18,252
Oh, honey.

1871
01:15:19,602 --> 01:15:22,256
She gave you
the gate?

1872
01:15:24,084 --> 01:15:25,390
What's the gate?

1873
01:15:25,433 --> 01:15:29,220
My baby's
growing up.

1874
01:15:30,395 --> 01:15:31,788
Listen, we got
a problem.

1875
01:15:31,831 --> 01:15:33,050
It's not
a big problem...

1876
01:15:33,093 --> 01:15:34,921
Can you keep
rubbing?

1877
01:15:34,965 --> 01:15:35,922
It's a talent thing.

1878
01:15:35,966 --> 01:15:37,533
All right?
You with me?

1879
01:15:37,576 --> 01:15:39,491
Yeah, I heard you.
Ok, we got a problem.

1880
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:40,797
What else is new?

1881
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,234
Don't ask
question number 3
to guest number 1.

1882
01:15:43,277 --> 01:15:44,235
Who's guest
number 1?

1883
01:15:44,278 --> 01:15:45,584
Broderick.and what's number 3?

1884
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:47,934
Hal linden. Not who's number 3.

1885
01:15:47,978 --> 01:15:49,196
What's the question
number 3?

1886
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,371
Yeah, for number 1.

1887
01:15:50,415 --> 01:15:51,982
What's the question
number 3 for number 1?

1888
01:15:52,025 --> 01:15:53,766
How's your dog?How's your dog?

1889
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:55,768
What?
Oh, I get
what you mean.

1890
01:15:55,812 --> 01:15:57,030
Don't...don't ask...Ok.

1891
01:15:57,074 --> 01:15:58,162
How's your dog?

1892
01:15:58,205 --> 01:15:59,816
People love
celebrity pets,
you see.

1893
01:15:59,859 --> 01:16:02,079
That's
all of it?

1894
01:16:02,122 --> 01:16:03,254
That's all of it.

1895
01:16:03,297 --> 01:16:05,604
That's a hell of
a price to pay
for a dog.

1896
01:16:05,648 --> 01:16:06,997
What are we
gonna name it?

1897
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,521
It totally
depends on its
personality.

1898
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:10,522
We're not
getting a puppy.

1899
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,176
I'm sure it
already has a name.

1900
01:16:12,219 --> 01:16:14,221
Well,
you can't give it
another name.

1901
01:16:14,265 --> 01:16:15,005
It'll get confused.

1902
01:16:15,048 --> 01:16:16,354
We might like
its name.

1903
01:16:16,397 --> 01:16:19,836
We're not naming,
we're napping.

1904
01:16:19,879 --> 01:16:21,620
Dognapping.

1905
01:16:21,664 --> 01:16:25,493
Exactly.

1906
01:16:25,537 --> 01:16:27,495
Exactly.

1907
01:16:27,539 --> 01:16:28,627
Did you find
the dog yet?

1908
01:16:28,671 --> 01:16:31,761
It doesn't matter.
We can't...It's gone.

1909
01:16:31,804 --> 01:16:35,373
Ok, fine. I won't
ask him the question.

1910
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:36,374
Good.

1911
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:37,941
Don't ask him,
"how's your dog?"

1912
01:16:37,984 --> 01:16:39,638
Please.
Find his dog.

1913
01:16:39,682 --> 01:16:41,640
Put up signs,
do something.

1914
01:16:41,684 --> 01:16:42,728
I'm working on it.

1915
01:16:42,772 --> 01:16:43,816
You keep saying
you're working
on it.

1916
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,123
You want makeup
back in here? Makeup!

1917
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:47,515
Send her in,
send her in.

1918
01:16:47,559 --> 01:16:48,865
Ok, all right.
Ok.

1919
01:16:48,908 --> 01:16:50,736
"Hey, Matthew,
how's your dog?"

1920
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:51,737
No, no, no.

1921
01:16:51,781 --> 01:16:53,696
Just kidding, Mitch,
just kidding.

1922
01:16:53,739 --> 01:16:55,088
Look good, feel good.
Take care of him.

1923
01:16:55,132 --> 01:16:58,570
Mitch, you know
I got that pounding
feeling again.

1924
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,791
Anything could happen.

1925
01:17:07,318 --> 01:17:09,755
Here you go, Angy.
Nice and toasty.

1926
01:17:09,799 --> 01:17:13,672
These are
delicious bagels,
Mrs. Charles.

1927
01:17:13,716 --> 01:17:14,586
Thank you.

1928
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,196
Angy, Keith, Nathan:
Thank you.

1929
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,198
You're welcome,
boys.

1930
01:17:18,242 --> 01:17:19,678
See, I put
the butter on

1931
01:17:19,722 --> 01:17:21,724
before
I toast them.

1932
01:17:21,767 --> 01:17:23,682
Scrumptious.

1933
01:17:23,726 --> 01:17:25,684
I'm gonna go get
a diet Pepsi.

1934
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:28,469
Can I get
anybody anything?

1935
01:17:28,513 --> 01:17:30,646
Uh-uh.

1936
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:51,449
Easy, easy, easy.

1937
01:17:56,236 --> 01:17:57,803
2 minutes to showtime.

1938
01:17:57,847 --> 01:17:59,675
Going live
in 2 minutes.

1939
01:17:59,718 --> 01:18:02,939
Band, crew, and talent,
take your places.

1940
01:18:02,982 --> 01:18:05,681
Almost time.

1941
01:18:05,724 --> 01:18:07,857
You want to watch?

1942
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:10,729
Why do they call it
midnight with Bobby
bishop

1943
01:18:10,773 --> 01:18:13,166
when it comes on
at 11:30?

1944
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:14,864
It's cute.

1945
01:18:14,907 --> 01:18:18,128
Hey, Ronnie!

1946
01:18:18,171 --> 01:18:19,303
Scumbag.

1947
01:18:19,346 --> 01:18:21,784
Oh, come on, Ron,
white flag, white flag.

1948
01:18:21,827 --> 01:18:24,525
Your boy
better be good.
I brought my gun.

1949
01:18:24,569 --> 01:18:26,353
And no dog,
or we're gone.

1950
01:18:26,397 --> 01:18:29,008
Hmm.

1951
01:18:29,052 --> 01:18:30,183
Ruff.

1952
01:18:30,227 --> 01:18:34,144
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

1953
01:18:34,187 --> 01:18:37,887
live, it's midnight
with New York City's

1954
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:39,192
favorite John...

1955
01:18:39,236 --> 01:18:42,195
Bobby bishop!

1956
01:18:45,068 --> 01:18:46,722
Kevin moss.

1957
01:18:46,765 --> 01:18:48,027
Can I speak with you?

1958
01:18:48,071 --> 01:18:50,160
Bobby's on.

1959
01:18:50,203 --> 01:18:52,553
Got him.

1960
01:18:52,597 --> 01:18:54,860
Oh!

1961
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:04,261
What are you doing?

1962
01:19:04,304 --> 01:19:06,654
Nothing.

1963
01:19:06,698 --> 01:19:08,787
Where do you think
you're going?

1964
01:19:08,831 --> 01:19:10,746
Oh...

1965
01:19:10,789 --> 01:19:12,965
Mom, this is
my friend Barry.

1966
01:19:13,009 --> 01:19:14,662
We're going out
for a little
while.

1967
01:19:14,706 --> 01:19:16,490
Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Charles.

1968
01:19:16,534 --> 01:19:18,014
Hello, Barry.

1969
01:19:18,057 --> 01:19:21,626
Well, don't you boys
stay out too late, now.

1970
01:19:21,669 --> 01:19:22,627
We won't.

1971
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,107
You promise me.

1972
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:26,587
I promise.

1973
01:19:36,075 --> 01:19:38,512
Feel this.

1974
01:19:38,991 --> 01:19:41,864
And here he is,

1975
01:19:41,907 --> 01:19:44,605
Bobby bishop!

1976
01:19:50,698 --> 01:19:54,790
Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

1977
01:20:06,889 --> 01:20:09,369
Now before we begin
the show,

1978
01:20:09,413 --> 01:20:11,154
first off, right away,

1979
01:20:11,197 --> 01:20:14,505
this is very
important to me.

1980
01:20:14,548 --> 01:20:16,333
Uh...

1981
01:20:16,376 --> 01:20:19,292
I never got a blow job
from that hooker.

1982
01:20:19,336 --> 01:20:20,163
What he say?

1983
01:20:20,206 --> 01:20:21,817
He didn't just say that.

1984
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:22,992
No blow job.

1985
01:20:23,035 --> 01:20:24,428
That's
what I thought
he said.

1986
01:20:24,471 --> 01:20:26,386
You can't say
blow job on TV.

1987
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:28,084
Why would
I say that?

1988
01:20:28,127 --> 01:20:30,738
This...

1989
01:20:30,782 --> 01:20:31,739
Right here...

1990
01:20:31,783 --> 01:20:35,569
This is not living.

1991
01:20:37,484 --> 01:20:41,575
I want to spend my life

1992
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:43,882
with somebody,

1993
01:20:43,926 --> 01:20:46,015
not a bunch
of fucking idiots

1994
01:20:46,058 --> 01:20:47,886
who waited in line
for hours

1995
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:51,107
to see this stupid
fucking talk show.

1996
01:20:56,939 --> 01:20:59,942
My whole life,
this is what I wanted.

1997
01:20:59,985 --> 01:21:02,683
To be right here

1998
01:21:02,727 --> 01:21:05,469
in this spot,
in front of this audience,

1999
01:21:05,512 --> 01:21:07,775
on this show,

2000
01:21:07,819 --> 01:21:09,821
with my theme song.

2001
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:13,346
That's what I wanted.

2002
01:21:13,390 --> 01:21:15,566
Because I thought
when I got here

2003
01:21:15,609 --> 01:21:19,526
that everything
would be ok.

2004
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:22,790
I would be happy.

2005
01:21:22,834 --> 01:21:25,358
This would make me happy.

2006
01:21:25,402 --> 01:21:28,971
And once I got here...

2007
01:21:29,014 --> 01:21:32,626
I would be able
to start living.

2008
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:35,760
That's what I thought.

2009
01:21:39,546 --> 01:21:42,636
But I wasted my life.

2010
01:21:45,378 --> 01:21:49,165
I had somebody
who adored me,

2011
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:51,602
and she was
the greatest audience

2012
01:21:51,645 --> 01:21:54,257
in the whole world.

2013
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:57,260
And we didn't
need any applause sign

2014
01:21:57,303 --> 01:21:59,697
to be happy.

2015
01:22:05,572 --> 01:22:06,922
Ok.

2016
01:22:06,965 --> 01:22:08,793
I realize
this is not funny.

2017
01:22:08,836 --> 01:22:12,449
This is not funny
for anybody.

2018
01:22:12,492 --> 01:22:15,539
I'm not being funny.

2019
01:22:16,409 --> 01:22:19,543
I'm not that funny.

2020
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:26,332
I'm just a guy.

2021
01:22:26,376 --> 01:22:28,944
I'm just a guy.

2022
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:31,816
Just a simple guy.

2023
01:22:33,818 --> 01:22:37,430
And, uh, you know what?

2024
01:22:37,474 --> 01:22:40,085
Fuck the network.

2025
01:22:40,129 --> 01:22:43,959
Fuck all the ratings.

2026
01:22:44,002 --> 01:22:46,483
And fuck you.

2027
01:22:49,747 --> 01:22:51,662
My name is Kevin.

2028
01:22:51,705 --> 01:22:53,751
I'm Kevin.

2029
01:22:53,794 --> 01:22:54,970
Uh...

2030
01:22:55,013 --> 01:22:56,928
Nice to meet you.

2031
01:23:02,586 --> 01:23:04,196
We're outta here.

2032
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:08,766
What a crazy talk show.

2033
01:23:25,304 --> 01:23:28,394
Fuck the network!
I'm not Bobby, I'm Kevin.

2034
01:23:28,438 --> 01:23:31,093
I'm empty, I'm Kevin,
I'm Kevin! No more show!

2035
01:23:31,136 --> 01:23:33,660
I'm Kevin. Nice to meet me,
nice to meet me.

2036
01:23:33,704 --> 01:23:34,922
I'm Kevin, I'm Kevin!

2037
01:23:34,966 --> 01:23:36,837
Fuck the network!
Fuck you!

2038
01:23:36,881 --> 01:23:39,971
I'm Kevin, I'm Kevin!

2039
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:52,070
Little Kevin moss,
all grown up.

2040
01:23:52,114 --> 01:23:54,290
Heh heh heh!

2041
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:58,076
Oh, Kevin,
you got so hairy.

2042
01:23:59,382 --> 01:24:01,210
Ow, ow, ow!
That hurt!

2043
01:24:01,253 --> 01:24:02,907
Did you get it?

2044
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:05,083
Are you fu...No,
I didn't get it.

2045
01:24:05,127 --> 01:24:05,953
Give me
a fucking break.

2046
01:24:05,997 --> 01:24:07,303
Of course
I fucking got...

2047
01:24:07,346 --> 01:24:08,478
What do you think
I was just doing?

2048
01:24:08,521 --> 01:24:10,349
You know, the dog
took a shit in the car.

2049
01:24:10,393 --> 01:24:14,092
The dog took a shit
in the car? Well...

2050
01:24:14,136 --> 01:24:15,485
Fine! Who...

2051
01:24:15,528 --> 01:24:18,270
Ok, ok, ok. Can we
go right now?

2052
01:24:18,314 --> 01:24:20,794
Please, please,
please?

2053
01:24:20,838 --> 01:24:23,101
Thank you.

2054
01:24:25,843 --> 01:24:27,627
Hey!

Will you just give me
a second here?

2092
01:25:57,543 --> 01:25:58,762
This is a very
upset dog.

2093
01:25:58,805 --> 01:26:00,067
Come on,
that thing is making
a ton of noise.

2094
01:26:00,111 --> 01:26:02,374
I know this, Barry.
Get it together.

2095
01:26:02,418 --> 01:26:05,116
I'm sorry.It's ok, it's ok.

2096
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,162
Ok, now get Louis started

Boys? Boys...

2100

What in the world
do you think
you're doing here?

2101
01:26:16,997 --> 01:26:18,999
Hey, mom.

2102
01:26:19,043 --> 01:26:23,439
Keith, I'm very
disappointed in you.

2103
01:26:24,483 --> 01:26:26,398
Whoa! Jesus!

2104
01:26:32,622 --> 01:26:34,580
Jesus, that was
fucking close!

2105
01:26:34,624 --> 01:26:35,842
Should we stop?

2106
01:26:35,886 --> 01:26:37,714
No, no, no!
Fucking...Oh,

Hey, you ok?

2114
01:27:24,326 --> 01:27:27,503
I don't know. It's
like it's stuck.

2115
01:27:40,994 --> 01:27:42,126
Hello.
Hi.

2116
01:27:42,169 --> 01:27:44,998
Um, I need to
speak to a, uh,

2117
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:48,088
crazy person you have
here named Nathan.

2118
01:27:48,132 --> 01:27:49,176
Nathan.

2119
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:50,308
Nathan, yes.

2120
01:27:50,352 --> 01:27:53,311
Nathan. Ok.

2121
01:27:53,355 --> 01:27:54,530
This way.

2122
01:27:54,573 --> 01:27:56,314
Thank you.

2123
01:27:56,358 --> 01:27:58,229
Did you see
the show?

2124
01:27:58,273 --> 01:27:59,839
Did you see it?

2125
01:27:59,883 --> 01:28:01,188
Sorry, I missed it.

2126
01:28:01,232 --> 01:28:02,929
Oh, you didn't
see the show?

2127
01:28:02,973 --> 01:28:03,930
No.

2128
01:28:03,974 --> 01:28:05,671
Lily...
What

2129
01:28:05,715 --> 01:28:07,804
I said things to you
on the show.

2130
01:28:07,847 --> 01:28:09,414
What did you say?

2131
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:11,503
Things. I can't
explain it now.

2132
01:28:11,547 --> 01:28:12,548
What kind of things?

2133
01:28:12,591 --> 01:28:15,507
Nice things. I said
things for you.

2134
01:28:15,551 --> 01:28:16,682
Like what?

2135
01:28:16,726 --> 01:28:19,946
Nice things.
How could you
miss the show?

2136
01:28:21,034 --> 01:28:22,384
Did you see
the show?

2137
01:28:22,427 --> 01:28:24,690
I saw it.

2138
01:28:24,734 --> 01:28:26,083
I want you
to love me again.

2139
01:28:26,126 --> 01:28:29,042
Can you love me
again, please?

2140
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,349
I can like you
a whole bunch.

2141
01:28:31,393 --> 01:28:34,613
No. Can you
love me again?

2142
01:28:46,582 --> 01:28:47,713
Ok, now here's
the deal.

2143
01:28:47,757 --> 01:28:49,802
We're gonna ask you
to do a monologue.

2144
01:28:49,846 --> 01:28:51,978
You think you can
remember a monologue?

2145
01:28:52,022 --> 01:28:53,371
Yeah?
Yeah.

2146
01:28:53,415 --> 01:28:56,113
Good. Give him
the monologue.

2147
01:28:56,156 --> 01:28:59,595
Hey, listen to me.
Hey, listen to me.

2148
01:28:59,638 --> 01:29:01,466
Ok, I want to tell you
something.

2149
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:03,250
I have seen talent.

2150
01:29:03,294 --> 01:29:04,861
Ok, that's all I want
to say. Let's go.

2151
01:29:04,904 --> 01:29:07,429
You gotta go something
with his hair.

2152
01:29:07,472 --> 01:29:08,560
His hair sucks.

2153
01:29:08,604 --> 01:29:09,996
I think earth tones.

2154
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,694
Can someone get
the door, please?

2155
01:29:11,737 --> 01:29:16,829
Could someone get
the door, please?
Jesus Christ!

2156
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:34,717
Mmm.

2157
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:35,718
Oh, Bobby.

2158
01:29:35,761 --> 01:29:38,721
What'd you call me?

2159
01:29:38,764 --> 01:29:41,114
Kevin.

2160
01:29:47,773 --> 01:29:51,473
Let's just look at it.
I've never seen
that much money.

2161
01:29:51,516 --> 01:29:52,778
Oh, ok, all right.

2162
01:29:52,822 --> 01:29:55,868
Hold on,
just hold on.

2163
01:29:59,002 --> 01:30:00,830
Fine.

2164
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:03,398
Ok. Ok, ok,

2165
01:30:03,441 --> 01:30:06,749
ok, ok, ok, ok, ok.

2166
01:30:08,185 --> 01:30:09,752
Oh, look.

2167
01:30:09,795 --> 01:30:11,057
Oh, my god.

2168
01:30:11,101 --> 01:30:11,971
Treats.

2169
01:30:12,015 --> 01:30:13,233
Oh, my god.

2170
01:30:13,277 --> 01:30:14,757
You're an idiot.
You're an idiot.

2171
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,977
You're an idiot.
Fuck me.
