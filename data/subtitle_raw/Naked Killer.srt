1
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,154
- Miss, Ihr Hund ist sehr hübsch.
- Ja. Er sieht aus wie unser Hund.

2
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,471
Wenn Sie Zeit haben, nehmen Sie ihn 
zu unserer Wohnung im 9. Stock.

3
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,598
 Was machst du in meiner Wohnung?

4
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,275
 Ich normalerweise eine Dusche
 vor dem ich arbeite. 

5
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,114
Dies ist der fünfte Mord
 in zwei Monaten.

6
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,432
Er wurde brutal ermordet, 
aber wir finden keine Anhaltspunkte. 

7
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,636
 Es muss eine professionelle Killer.

8
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,511
Verdammt! Der Mörder ist sehr gewalttätig, 
 er selbst schoss ihm in die Eier.

9
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,312
- Ist es dieser Musik?
- Yeah.

10
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,794
- Wie kann man daran erinnern?
- Er liebte gerade Japanisch porn.

11
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,235
I could normally
hear the girls moaning.

12
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,393
But last night he changed to
classical music so I remember it.

13
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,311
How do you know they were porn films?

14
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,676
- I know porn when I see it.
- How's it going?

15
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,719
He's the third witness who could hear
this song when the victim was killed.

16
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,429
I think the murderer likes to listen
to Mozart while he's killing.

17
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,033
I don't believe that.

18
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,714
Sir, we found two corpses
on the 9th floor.

19
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,313
They are an old couple.

20
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,359
- PC 369, get a statement from him.
- Yes, sir. Come with me, kid.

21
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,438
Maybe he was killed
because he saw the killer.

22
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,398
Go and shave and save
the logic to Sherlock Holmes.

23
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,110
Sir, I think the killer
could be a woman.

24
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,276
I shouldn't have asked you to come.

25
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,309
How could a woman throw
a 20-stone man from there to here?

26
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,550
How could it be a woman?

27
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,717
The last two victims were naked
and their limbs were broken.

28
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,950
Their genitals had been ripped off.

29
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,795
In this case, the victim's
limbs and skull were all broken.

30
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,792
His genitals were shot off too.

31
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,235
The killer might be a woman.

32
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,710
The last two cases
were about sex disputes.

33
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,237
This one must be a Triad
punishing one of their own.

34
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,153
Tinam, please stop daydreaming.

35
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,552
The last two victims had their
genitals ripped off during sex.

36
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,200
What, so they were shagging
a female gorilla?

37
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,751
How could a woman have such strength?
It must be done by a couple of men.

38
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,559
- Tinam, take some more holiday, OK?
- But I'm OK now.

39
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,837
You killed your brother
three months ago, how can you be OK?

40
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,672
Shut up or I'll kill you!

41
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,757
- Sir, you know it was an accident.
- I know.

42
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,549
A normal person would never recover
from such a trauma.

43
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,599
I reinstated you so quickly
because of your brother.

44
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,433
You should've taken
the extra psychotherapy.

45
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,114
I'm fully recovered now.

46
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,637
Really?! You can't even hold a gun.
How can you say you're OK?

47
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,676
Nobody will admit if they’re nuts.

48
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,718
I'm transferring to
the Anti-porn Department.

49
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,553
You should not be on this case!

50
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,831
When you have time, go to the barber.
You'll look better.

51
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,510
Stop, or I'll shoot.

52
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,640
One of our men is injured,
call the ambulance.

53
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,675
Brother, why was it you?

54
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,631
Brother!

55
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,595
You could buy some tampons
to plug her mouth and ass.

56
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,269
It's fresh milk, especially for you.

57
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,237
I won't give it to anyone else.

58
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,915
Really? Do you want me
to give you something in return?

59
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,552
- You know what l want, don't you?
- You're like a wolf.

60
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,392
Excuse me.

61
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,554
That chick's so horny.
I'm sure you can shag her.

62
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,392
I'll be the next.

63
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,871
Keep it down. lf she hears you
we'll have no chance. Be smart!

64
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,116
Be careful with the scissors.

65
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,714
Women are like fire. Be careful.

66
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,155
I'm not worried. I've got a big hose.

67
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,596
If you nick my ears,
I'll cut your hose off.

68
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,830
You're naughty!

69
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,956
This is going to be tough!

70
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,713
Tommy! What have you been up to?

71
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,155
I'm working! I'll call you later.

72
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,955
Do you want to dump me
because I’m pregnant?

73
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,079
What? You mean it's my baby.
How can you prove it?

74
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,631
You always fool around.
How can l possibly be the father?

75
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,153
How dare you say this?

76
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,676
Come on, just have an abortion
and everything will be sorted.

77
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,638
There's no need to make a scene here.
Right?

78
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,030
Of course! We're just friends.

79
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,556
You're trying to set me up,
aren't you?

80
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,234
I've lived with you for six months!

81
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,638
You're the only man l have.

82
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,395
He doesn't want you,
he loves me now. Why don't you leave?

83
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,436
Sorry about this.

84
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,836
Don't say you've got my baby.

85
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,833
Now take this money
and get yourself out of here.

86
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,751
Bitch! How dare you?

87
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,637
I'll help with the abortion!

88
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,312
You're a tough guy!

89
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,239
Go to hell!

90
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,196
How dare you bully my friend?

91
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,352
Now do you believe me?
I've only been here twice,

92
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,874
and he still wants
to dump you for me!

93
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,712
You should forget him!

94
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,549
- I'll cut his dick off!
- Police, stop!

95
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,471
Stop!

96
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,473
Run!

97
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,391
Call the ambulance.

98
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,277
I feel as if l lost one of my balls!

99
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,116
You go first, I'll take care of this.

100
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,634
Don't move.

101
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,516
Move and I’ll shoot.

102
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,036
Why don't you shoot?
Are you afraid of writing reports?

103
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,032
- Why did you beat him up?
- Dick deserved it.

104
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,076
Only Ah Si trusts that bastard.

105
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,469
He's called Tommy, not Dick.

106
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,314
You're too old, man!
I mean he is a dick!

107
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,719
I'll scream.

108
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,911
Help! Help!

109
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,195
Don't move!

110
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,237
You all right? l was only kidding.

111
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,118
Why are you so scared?
Here, have your gun back.

112
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,397
Even this makes you want to throw up.
Poor you!

113
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,950
- What's your name?
- Tinam.

114
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,713
I like your name.

115
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,917
Now I'll let you go, because that...
what's his name?

116
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,434
- Dick.
- Because that dick deserved it.

117
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,272
You can't say that.

118
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,717
It's me, Kitty, who let you go.
I won't sue you for molesting me.

119
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,798
What are you doing?

120
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,314
Get out of here, will you?

121
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,519
I'd have cut your dick off too
if you’d dared to stay.

122
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,078
He's so scared,
he even forgot his pager.

123
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,636
Chinese Pager.

124
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,757
Hello, Chinese Pager.
Tinam, did you drop your pager?

125
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,478
Did you vomit then?

126
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,872
- You've got my pager?
- It's lucky for me l picked it up.

127
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,632
I work here, by the way.

128
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,269
- How can I get it back?
- Treat me to a candlelit dinner.

129
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,112
I won't waste any time on you.

130
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,954
I work at Kowloon Police Station.
Bring it to me tomorrow.

131
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,556
Dickhead,
did anyone bring me my pager?

132
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,914
I don't think so.

133
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,074
But there's a girl claiming one
of our colleagues tried to rape her.

134
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,239
A girl? Where is she?

135
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,276
inside, she's making a statement.

136
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,033
You drink it.

137
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,350
Tinam, come and see me later.

138
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,597
- You look rather pale.
- Nonsense.

139
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,558
- Are you nervous?
- About what?!

140
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,710
Why are you drinking my milk then?

141
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,594
- It's sorted.
- Thanks.

142
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,796
- Come to my office.
- She...

143
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,313
Now!

144
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,391
You can go now.

145
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,749
- Coffee?
- No, I've had some milk.

146
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,789
That lady just told me
how she was harassed.

147
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,191
Well done.

148
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,875
She's the first one to praise you
since you were reinstated.

149
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,352
Really? What did she say?

150
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,752
She said you were brave and able
to deal with difficult situations.

151
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,991
She said you fought off
that sex offender.

152
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,710
And that you chased him
for 15 minutes until he disappeared.

153
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,030
You're really fit then.

154
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,750
I go jogging every morning.

155
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,712
You would recognize that guy,
wouldn't you?

156
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,951
Go with the girl
and make up an image of the rapist.

157
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,512
- Me go with her?
- Yes.

158
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,355
She's even written a letter
to the radio station to praise you.

159
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,188
You're flattering me!

160
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,356
Stop... Stop!

161
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,759
Stop.

162
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,875
Kitty!

163
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,394
Just pretend you're my boyfriend.

164
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,319
- Kitty!
- Dad!

165
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,789
What a coincidence!

166
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,953
- Who's this?
- He's my new friend.

167
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,316
I see!

168
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,197
This is Tinam. He's a cop.

169
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,510
I've got to go now.
I've got to get to the food stall.

170
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,760
- Take care of Kitty.
- Sure! I'll take care of her.

171
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,751
- Don't worry.
- All right.

172
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,114
Take care.

173
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,435
You're good at using people.

174
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,753
- Give me my pager.
- Come shopping with me first.

175
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,277
Here's your pager.

176
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,311
This isn't my pager.

177
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,073
You're very sexy.

178
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,957
What do you want, Peeping Tom?

179
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,549
Give me the money first.

180
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,996
- Are you ignoring me?
- I think we've got a generation gap.

181
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,752
But you fancy me, don't you?

182
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,431
Are you joking? l fancy you?

183
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,715
You wouldn't have been with me
all day otherwise.

184
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,758
You've given me
enough trouble down at the station.

185
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,115
I just wanted to teach you
how to be polite...

186
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,751
so you won't
hang up the phone in a rude way.

187
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,799
There's only two of us here.
Do you think that l might rape you?

188
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,434
- I can see part of you.
- What is it?

189
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,476
Your mole.

190
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,518
Why are you pointing
your pink pistol at me?

191
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,518
It's not fun now!

192
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,071
What are you doing?

193
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,116
We should have met earlier.

194
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,431
You're making a lot of noise.

195
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,876
I'm not.

196
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,111
You'll have to stop.
We should leave now.

197
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,834
They're laughing at you. You wolf!

198
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,639
- I haven't had sex for ages.
- You can shag him.

199
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,676
Really? Can l swap him for you?

200
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,716
It's your word.
Don't go, Mr Four-eyes!

201
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,153
Are you mad?

202
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,351
- I really should thank you.
- Thank me? For what?

203
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,237
You'll find out later.

204
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,232
- I'm off.
- Let me take you home.

205
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,039
Have you never heard of minibuses?

206
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,271
- What's my new pager number?
- A lucky number for you.

207
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,552
1647?!

208
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,275
Lan, why the long face?

209
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,273
What are you sulking about now?
Mind those bowls.

210
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,512
We haven't got much business.
Why don't you close it down?

211
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,309
I told you long ago in China
that l run a food stall.

212
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,190
But I didn't know you were that poor.
If I did I wouldn't have come.

213
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,158
All right.

214
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,871
It's all my fault, OK?

215
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,838
Tonight's very quiet,
finish it off yourself.

216
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,672
I'm going to bed.

217
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,917
Dad, what's going on?

218
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,956
- Nothing.
- Is she bullying you again?

219
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,513
Come on, Kitty!

220
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,194
I don't see why
you're so afraid of her.

221
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,238
She's your step-mother anyway.

222
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,629
We shouldn't quarrel
over such nonsense.

223
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,549
- Have you had dinner yet?
- Not yet.

224
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,559
You still haven't had dinner?
Why is your boyfriend so mean?

225
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,669
Business wasn't good tonight. I'll
cook you the remaining won-tons, OK?

226
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,598
- Let's eat together then.
- Sounds good!

227
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,078
Kitty, don't be too mean
to your boyfriend. Be nice to him.

228
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,515
I've got it. Don't worry, Dad!

229
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,912
You go home first. l need
to make a call across the road.

230
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,596
- Can't you do it at home?
- I don't want that woman to hear it.

231
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,879
- Come on, you go up first.
- OK, I'm going. Don't be too long.

232
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,313
OK.

233
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,275
You bastard! You bitch!

234
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,396
Now you're here,
let's sort this out.

235
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,393
Your wife wants to live with me. Give
me $20,000 and we can sort this out.

236
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,833
You son of a bitch!

237
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,718
I want to kill you. I'll kill you!

238
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,878
- Please don't!
- Piss off!

239
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,712
- I'll kill that bastard!
- Run!

240
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,756
I'll kill you!

241
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,393
Go to hell!

242
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,319
Dad!

243
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,553
Dad!

244
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,958
- Go on!
- Run!

245
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,836
Stop!

246
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,672
I'll kill you, bastard!

247
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,751
- You killed my dad!
- Go on, Bee!

248
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,751
- Stop!
- Go to hell!

249
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,514
Stop!

250
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,319
Kitty. Meet you at 7 o'clock
at the canteen.

251
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,035
- Have you found his daughter?
- Not yet.

252
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,758
We don't know where she is.

253
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,876
- Find her and then kill her.
- Yes, sir!

254
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,520
- What are you waiting for?
- Let's go.

255
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,949
Excuse me...

256
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,431
- Where's Bee?
- I don't know.

257
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,794
Where is he?

258
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,231
Bitch!

259
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,230
- You killed my dad!
- Please don't get mad!

260
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,198
- I didn't mean to kill him!
- Bastard!

261
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,714
I'll blow off your ass, you bastard!

262
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,438
I'll break your head!

263
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,430
- You bitch! You shot my ass.
- Bastard!

264
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,273
Get lost!
Do you still want to kill me?

265
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,713
You bitch!

266
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,193
You shot me in the ass!
You bitch! Fuck you!

267
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,831
- Go to hell!
- You useless shit!

268
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,797
You just let her shoot my ass.

269
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,155
Get her inside.
You want to kill me, eh?

270
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,832
Rape her!

271
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,711
All of you get out!
You little cocky bitch!

272
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,998
Me first.

273
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,192
Go to hell!

274
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,311
Go to hell!

275
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,158
What's going on?

276
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,390
Stay away!

277
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,110
Stay away!

278
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,878
- Where's your car?
- Not here! It's on the next floor.

279
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,518
Come on!

280
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,196
- Please don't kill me!
- OK, but you'll have to help me up.

281
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,272
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought you could handle it.

282
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,517
Catch it!

283
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,714
- I can't see them.
- Where are they?

284
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,553
You two go that way.
You come with me.

285
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,595
Smile!

286
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,831
- Who are you?
- Smile! They call me Sister Cindy.

287
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,113
Have you woken up?
Why don't you sleep a bit longer?

288
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,435
- What are you doing?
- I'm eating noodles.

289
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,512
I'll do your last finger
once I’ve finished.

290
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,354
Are you crazy? You're nuts!

291
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,914
Why are you doing this to me?
Where are my fingers? Where are they?

292
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,233
Why only nine fingers?

293
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,279
I was starving. I'll do your last
finger after I finish my noodles.

294
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,920
You want to chop this one off too,
don't you?

295
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,356
I don't mean to chop it off.
I'm changing your fingerprints.

296
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,149
What? You're crazy!

297
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,515
You're the one that's crazy.

298
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,478
Look at this!

299
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,030
A woman has robbed a finance company,
killing many people.

300
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,716
The company lost $450,000.
A $100,000 reward...

301
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,109
You're very famous now.

302
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,589
You're very unprofessional!

303
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,389
You left your fingerprints
all over the place.

304
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,232
Do you know they've got CCTV?

305
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,551
Now, apart from changing
your identity and fingerprints,

306
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,518
there's one other option -
you can go to prison.

307
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,673
You'll be raped by the dykes
once a day and treated like a dog.

308
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,716
They'll release you when you're 40

309
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,758
but you'll look like
a 60-year-old granny.

310
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,594
Nothing you can do after that,
other than work in a nightclub.

311
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,434
Not as a waitress or the manager,
but as the toilet maid.

312
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,718
- Stop!
- Besides, you know my face now.

313
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,634
The rule in our game is to kill those
who recognize our faces.

314
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,598
- Do you want to kill me?
- No, I don't.

315
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,353
- Why are you helping me?
- You're lucky.

316
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,908
I believe you have it in you
to be a hit woman.

317
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,877
- Who are you, then?
- A hit woman.

318
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,997
- Hit woman?
- A contract killer.

319
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,672
A professional one.

320
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,195
But we help society
get rid of those bastards.

321
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,239
Bastards like Bee deserve to die.

322
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,118
- We kill people who deserve to die.
- You want me to help you kill them?

323
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,910
You don't help me, you help yourself.
They're looking for you everywhere.

324
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,756
- Why would l want to be a hit woman?
- To make big money.

325
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,876
Then you could have everything.

326
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,396
You know, those with the most power
rule this world.

327
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,232
The most powerful one rules.

328
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,949
I don't think you're so stupid
you'd choose to go to prison.

329
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,276
This is your new identity.

330
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,673
Shang Hil-qun.

331
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,231
You're an air hostess,
from Singapore, aged 23.

332
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,959
You don't have any parents,
only a sister.

333
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,549
I'm sleepy.

334
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,837
- Come on!
- What are we doing?

335
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,556
Who's he?

336
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,798
He's a pedophile,
he's raped lots of little girls.

337
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,872
I've wanted to teach him a lesson
for a while.

338
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,034
- Bitch, do you want me to fuck you?
- Let me do it. You son of a bitch!

339
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,149
Scumbag!
It's your bad luck to meet me!

340
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,993
Come on then, why don't you kiss me?

341
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,352
Where are you? Give me some scissors,
I'll cut his dick off.

342
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,830
I want to see how you deal with
life and death situations.

343
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,913
- I won't open the door.
- Open up! You bitch!

344
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,312
The door key's on that guy's waist.
Either let him rape you or kill him.

345
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,153
Open up or I'll
squeeze your tits till they burst.

346
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,196
I'll count to three. One, two...

347
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,956
Go to hell!

348
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,552
Bitch, I’ll squeeze your tits!

349
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,198
You bitch, I’ll squeeze your tits!

350
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,713
Three minutes and seven seconds.
You were too slow.

351
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,509
There are ten pieces of broken glass,
four screwdrivers,

352
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,909
an iron wire
and a gun next to the wall

353
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,275
but you took three minutes
to kill him.

354
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,750
- Your judgment is poor.
- What if he had raped me?

355
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,031
Then blame yourself for being stupid.
Remember this.

356
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:59,148
When you have to kill your opponent,
you have to find a weapon first.

357
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,920
- What if there's no weapon?
- Can't you think?

358
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,916
We're women,
and our body is a weapon, too.

359
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,549
- What if she hasn't got tits?
- Don't stop me feeling myself.

360
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,470
Any kind of man
can be defeated by your charms.

361
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,758
It doesn't matter whether
your tits are big or small.

362
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,636
Even no tits won't make a difference.

363
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,676
You only need to make them happy.

364
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,151
What's this about? Are you teaching
me to be a killer or a hooker?

365
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,189
The tricks of the trade are the same.

366
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,877
Big tits, small tits, even no tits.
What's the big deal?

367
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,475
Come on. Attack me.

368
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,755
I've got a knife. You can't beat me.

369
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,672
Help!

370
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,991
Stop calling for help,
and think how to defeat me.

371
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,072
You've got my feet.
How can l defeat you?

372
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,230
OK, now you twist my feet.

373
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,916
I've got you!

374
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,037
That really hurts!

375
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,513
The principle of killing is
to use whatever you've got to hand

376
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,239
and turn that into a weapon.

377
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,629
You can use a knife or a sword.

378
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,273
You can also use high-heels,
tights, or a toothbrush.

379
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,316
A toothbrush?

380
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,759
Once l rammed a toothbrush
up a man's nose.

381
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,991
It hit his brain,
and he was killed instantly.

382
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,751
But the most powerful weapon still

383
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,513
is our body.

384
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,918
No matter whether they are
men or women,

385
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:03,317
their weakest point
is when they reach orgasm.

386
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,032
Then no one has the power to resist.

387
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,678
At that point,

388
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,192
it's...

389
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,390
the perfect moment to kill them.

390
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,320
When you're about to kill someone,
you should know everything about him

391
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,231
so you must be prepared.

392
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,318
You have to make a file on him.

393
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,872
You should know his living habits,
the places he hangs out.

394
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,512
Also his hobbies, his strengths
and weaknesses, his temper,

395
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,995
and even his sexual habits.

396
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,755
Sex is a very good weapon.

397
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,757
No matter whether your target
is a man or a woman,

398
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,673
they are all interested in sex.

399
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,835
One of your seniors is a lesbian.

400
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,950
My senior?

401
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,836
Let's not talk about her.

402
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,471
Anyway, you have to know
every detail about your target.

403
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,154
I'll teach you how to make the file.

404
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,032
Is that it?

405
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,111
Why do you have my file?

406
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,079
I went through your stuff
while you were out last week.

407
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,996
Did you think
I wouldn't find out?

408
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,596
You went to China four years ago,
I think you've forgotten going there.

409
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:50,595
You were called Shaw Bing, aged 35,
your star sign is Scorpio.

410
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,878
You wear a 36D bra.
You like drinking red wine.

411
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,838
I believe you haven't had sex
for quite a while.

412
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,908
How do you know that?

413
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,754
You've masturbated twice
in the last five nights.

414
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,756
Have you been spying on me?

415
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,199
Yes, I do every night.
Don't shout too loud next time.

416
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,430
Even the neighbours can hear it.

417
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,832
- You're very immoral.
- More immoral than killing people?

418
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,475
But I have to tell you, all the
people I've killed deserved to die.

419
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:38,030
Your senior only cares about money,
not the innocent people.

420
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,076
She'd even kill her dad for money.

421
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,118
Didn't you say not to talk about her?

422
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,158
She's the most sought-after
in our profession.

423
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,518
You'll have to meet her
sooner or later. Be careful!

424
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,750
I know she's very tough.

425
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,751
How do you know?

426
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,434
If she wasn't,
you wouldn't have prepared her file.

427
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,039
I told you I thought you had it in
you. But we still have to be careful.

428
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,354
Have you asked someone
to buy you breakfast?

429
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,192
They're getting it now.

430
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,874
Are you still thinking about
your chick?

431
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,236
She's killed lots of people.
She's nothing but trouble.

432
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,675
Bee's men have been looking for her.

433
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,239
- Kitty's had such a hard time.
- You should think of yourself.

434
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,072
Why are you taking
my bloody cigarette?

435
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,390
Not as bloody as the killer.

436
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,995
The last victim had his limbs broken,
but this is even worse.

437
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,719
- His dick's gone.
- Pardon?

438
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,268
They're questioning the maid.

439
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,636
Sir, your breakfast.

440
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,676
What else did you hear last night?

441
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,076
Did your master shag you?

442
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,038
- Who is touching your ass?
- You bastard!

443
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,951
They can't find...

444
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,636
his penis.

445
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,516
I mean bird.

446
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,875
- What's going on?
- How do you say dick in English?

447
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,671
His dick?! You can't find his dick,
you dickhead!

448
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,873
Bastard!

449
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,716
This sausage is cold.

450
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,670
Look! There's some flesh up here.

451
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,234
- What is it?
- Seems to be the victim's testicles.

452
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,390
- Come again?
- His balls!

453
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,156
The colour is similar to this one.

454
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,198
Do you want me to lose my appetite?
No way!

455
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,908
Can you see a girl taking a shower?

456
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,390
- No! A woman's been watching us.
- So what?

457
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,636
Some criminals like to come back
to the scene of the crime.

458
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,075
Are you saying she's the killer?

459
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,436
I think there is
a female killer group.

460
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,672
The last case, and Kitty's
case too, it was the same woman.

461
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,914
I think this case
is related to the last one.

462
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,197
- They didn't believe you last time.
- I believe you.

463
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,552
I know what you think.

464
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,760
I think there is more than one
female killer working in this area.

465
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,071
They use different ways to kill,
some brutal, some not.

466
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,789
I'll ask your boss to let
you carry out the investigation.

467
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,235
- You have your chance now.
- I wish I could see Kitty again.

468
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,198
Look at you,
you look as if you've eaten a dick.

469
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,313
Did you eat that missing dick?

470
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,710
What? Do you think
I've eaten that dick?

471
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,952
Kitty!

472
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,758
Sister Cindy!

473
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:49,755
They've got the door key
and I've taken away the weapons.

474
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,479
They're going to squeeze your tits.

475
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,158
Come on!

476
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,110
I am impressed!

477
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,235
Kitty, your first mission is
to kill a man in Japan tomorrow.

478
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,276
He's called Taki.

479
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,832
My mission is
to kill someone in Japan!

480
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,235
Boss, do you want me to wait outside?

481
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,276
Are you nuts?

482
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,157
Of course!

483
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,596
If someone tricks me,
I'll sell you as a rent boy.

484
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,232
Boss, you sing very well.

485
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,788
Shut the fuck up! It’s the password!

486
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,836
Where's my aphrodisiac?

487
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,913
Boss.

488
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,868
- Why did he spray it in his mouth?
- To make his tongue harder, I guess.

489
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,633
- What's your name?
- I'm Baby.

490
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,397
Are you into kinky games?

491
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,876
I don't mind kinky games.

492
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,195
After we finish this,
should we go to Hawaii for a holiday?

493
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,111
Not yet.

494
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,272
We've still got
another big job to do.

495
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,950
What is it?

496
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,270
A Japanese Triad wants me
to kill somebody for them.

497
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,113
She's going to be very difficult.

498
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,231
Who is she?

499
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,673
It's...

500
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,516
Sister Cindy.

501
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,636
She's your master, isn't she?

502
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,393
My master is already
very difficult to deal with.

503
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,552
Now she's got
a very good new student.

504
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,511
You mean...
we aren't good enough to kill them.

505
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,074
We should kill them one by one.

506
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,915
First of all,
we should get rid of her star pupil.

507
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,996
Do you agree?

508
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,036
I agree.

509
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,391
You've tried every way possible
to join my department.

510
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,517
I don't think I can
turn down your request any more.

511
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:02,831
The recent murder cases are like
those that happened six months ago.

512
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,679
Our boss thinks your theory about
a female killer gang may be possible.

513
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,035
A Triad leader died last night.

514
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:16,240
The way he was killed
was similar to those cases.

515
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,517
His limbs and penis were all missing.

516
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,959
They seem to have been
torn off by someone.

517
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,873
- Have you got any leads?
- Yes, we have this time.

518
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,317
A few hours before the murder,
he was seen with an air hostess.

519
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,949
- Is she the suspect?
- That's what l want you to find out.

520
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,159
Damn it! This is a big house
for an air hostess.

521
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,309
She's a mistress.

522
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,233
- It might be her dad's house!
- Or her sugar daddy's.

523
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,120
- How can I help?
- We're policemen.

524
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,156
We'd like to meet Miss Shang Hil-qun.

525
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,356
Miss, there are two policemen
here to see you.

526
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,789
Are you policemen?

527
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,552
Kitty!

528
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,955
Kitty.

529
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,230
I haven't got any kitties here.

530
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,359
I'm Tinam, Kitty!

531
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,636
I'm sorry. My name's Shang Hil-qun.
I think you're mistaken.

532
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,156
By the way, you can call me Vivian.

533
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,959
Sorry, I mistook you
for one of my friends.

534
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,712
What are you here for?

535
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,758
We want your assistance
in a murder case.

536
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,910
The victim's a Mr Kan Ti-san.

537
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,759
But I don't know him.

538
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,879
You were seen with him
before the murder.

539
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,272
I met him at a cocktail party.
He drove me home.

540
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,796
So you were the last one to see him.
Can you make a statement?

541
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,075
No problem.
But I have to get changed first.

542
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,039
- Dickhead. Dickhead!
- What?

543
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,032
- Do think she looks like Kitty?
- Which Kitty?

544
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,156
The one who was in Lee's office.

545
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,198
There are lots of girls.
How can i remember her?

546
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,838
Lee will recognize her!

547
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,275
This is a serious matter.

548
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,158
Tell our man not to
leak any news to the press.

549
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,629
- What's up?
- Lee's died!

550
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,029
This is going to be tough.

551
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,635
Tinam.

552
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,352
Why would Lee kill himself?

553
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,796
I don't know.
Five minutes ago l heard a gunshot.

554
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,758
I rushed in and saw him
covered in blood.

555
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:19,311
A few hours before the murder,
he was seen with an air hostess.

556
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,795
- Dickhead, get a statement from her.
- What happened?

557
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,757
When did you arrive at the party?

558
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,909
8:30pm.

559
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,037
- What kind of party was it?
- It was a film's premiere.

560
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,271
My girlfriend asked me to go
but she didn't turn up.

561
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,715
What's the victim called?

562
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,874
Was this the guy?

563
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,679
Yes, it was.

564
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,357
He came over and chatted to me.

565
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,193
The party was boring,
so was the film.

566
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,713
So I let him drive me home.

567
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,199
Where do you live?

568
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,074
No 99, Old Peak Road.

569
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:09,039
Do you always look at men like that?
You think I'm good-looking or what?

570
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:15,553
Compared to the other men in Hong
Kong, you're very good-looking.

571
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,996
Don't put that down.

572
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,311
Are you free for dinner tonight?

573
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,713
We can eat raw beef.

574
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,834
It tastes awful, doesn't it?

575
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,352
Are you all right, sir?

576
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,553
I'm fine.

577
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,632
Do you still want me
to be your girlfriend?

578
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,518
Yes! You're my girlfriend.

579
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,636
I've told you lots of times, I'm not!

580
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,679
But I'm honored
if you think I'm your girlfriend.

581
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,113
David.

582
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,637
You must recognize the one
that taught Tommy a lesson.

583
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,280
I'm sure I can recognize her.

584
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,750
I've got witnesses, Kitty!

585
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,911
Tinam, where is she?

586
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,560
Are you mad? She's right here.

587
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,553
That's Kitty?! She doesn't look like
the one that hit Tommy.

588
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,119
Don't trick me.

589
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,713
I wouldn't dare.

590
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,519
If you want me to say she is,
I'll give this back.

591
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,671
Tinam, I think you must love
your girlfriend very much.

592
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,354
Otherwise, you wouldn't say
I'm her all the time.

593
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,192
You're right.

594
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,236
I love her a lot.

595
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,515
She was involved in a murder case.

596
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,353
I wanted to
track her down and help her.

597
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,193
But I could never
get in touch with her.

598
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,158
She seems to have disappeared
into thin air!

599
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,437
She'd be really touched
if she could hear that.

600
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,956
- Really?
- Tinam, I'm leaving now.

601
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,032
Bravo.

602
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,755
Dial 999! Dial 999!

603
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,437
- Tinam.
- It's me.

604
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,796
The air hostess has been shot.
She's in hospital now.

605
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,716
Kitty!

606
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,640
- Tinam!
- This is for you.

607
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,234
- They're lovely!
- You're Kitty!

608
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,596
Do you know you're in great danger?

609
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,358
Are you still
thinking about that girl?

610
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,476
She's got to be Kitty.

611
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,028
Her eyes! I know she's Kitty
from her eyes!

612
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,680
She doesn't admit it,
and you can't prove it.

613
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,593
The witnesses
are dropping like flies.

614
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,478
This girl's dangerous.
Don't get involved.

615
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,358
That's why
I want to find out the truth.

616
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,750
You think you're Superman,
you're just a policeman.

617
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,308
Every man's got a pistol,
but we got one more.

618
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,349
My instinct tells me it's something
you just can't do by force.

619
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,159
Just do what you're told
or you'll get into trouble.

620
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,152
I want to tell you a big secret.

621
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,471
After I killed my brother,
I became impotent.

622
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,076
- What? Bullshit!
- I couldn't get a hard-on.

623
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:39,836
The day after I saw Kitty,
I got my first stiffy.

624
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,633
Congratulations!

625
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,235
Then when I saw her
in the swimming pool, I had another.

626
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,279
Don't tell me only she
can cure your impotence!

627
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,475
Kitty!

628
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,955
- Who are you looking for?
- Miss Shang.

629
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,196
- She's out.
- I'd better leave.

630
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,077
Wait a minute.

631
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,079
Come in and take a seat.

632
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,512
Here.

633
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,115
How did you know I like vodka?

634
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,318
A man like you
is bound to like vodka.

635
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,195
I'm Hil-qun's sister.

636
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,869
They call me Sister Cindy.

637
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,358
Is Shang Hil-qun really her name?

638
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:10,675
My lawyer told me that my sister
has nothing to do with that case.

639
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,995
You must be here for something else.

640
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,394
Lots of guys
want to go out with my sister.

641
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,755
- Are you confident?
- No...but I’m determined.

642
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,912
I love men like you.

643
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,075
Sorry, I want more ice.

644
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,392
Apparently...

645
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,395
you mistook my sister
for someone else.

646
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,994
I'm not mistaken.
I'm sure she's someone else.

647
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,796
I'm sorry. I have to go now.

648
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,152
- Who do you think she is?
- Someone I'll never forget.

649
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,639
Sister Cindy!

650
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,194
- Kitty!
- What are you doing here?

651
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,033
Do you want to date me?

652
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,829
That's what he wants.
Why don't you give him a chance?

653
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,672
Stay here for dinner, OK?

654
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,591
But he's a busy man.

655
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:27,830
Sorry, I need to get changed first.
My boyfriend's coming to pick me up.

656
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,160
Fine! I know you're not Kitty.

657
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,794
I really want to help you,
if you are Kitty.

658
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,433
May I be excused?

659
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,076
See you!

660
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,679
Why did you stop me?

661
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,399
He's a cop.
If he dies here, we'll be in trouble.

662
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,516
I could dispose of the body.

663
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,431
But they know he's visited us.

664
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:00,593
When I killed that policeman in the
station i didn't leave any clues.

665
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,511
No one's suspecting us.

666
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,078
I think you don't
want him to die, right?

667
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,276
I don't think he deserves to die.

668
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:14,908
He already knows too much.
And he's suspecting you.

669
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,355
Now you see why I want him to die.

670
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,196
If you don't kill him,
you'll be killed one day.

671
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,714
Remember you're a killer, you
can't let emotion get in the way.

672
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,837
- I'll kill him myself.
- Will you?

673
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,556
- Really?
- There's always a first time.

674
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,595
Right.

675
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:45,112
This house has been exposed,
I'm going to sell it.

676
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,395
I'll send you somewhere else.

677
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,950
Enjoy your first time.

678
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,951
Don't disappoint me.

679
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,794
Kitty, meet me at 9 o'clock
at the parking lot by the tunnel.

680
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:49,279
K- Are you looking for your pager?
- When did you come in?

681
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,316
I've been here for a long time.

682
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,356
But i didn't want to disturb you.

683
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,149
Don't shout too loud
next time you make love.

684
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,595
The neighbours might hear it.

685
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,432
Give me back my pager.

686
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,996
He really loves you.
No wonder you miss him so much.

687
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,430
Why are you always getting
new batteries for your pager?

688
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,078
So i don't miss him.

689
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,635
All right.
I want to tell you something.

690
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,676
The Japs want to get revenge.

691
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,320
- They've hired Princess to kill us.
- Princess?

692
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,872
She's your senior.

693
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,350
You must be very careful
not to let her see you.

694
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,398
She might kill you
after she's raped you.

695
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,956
All men are heartless.

696
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,120
You should never fall for them.
You'll lose everything.

697
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,313
Shit!

698
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,116
Have you been waiting long?

699
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,596
Do you miss me?

700
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,076
I miss you like mad!

701
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,712
Kitty.

702
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,998
I'm Hil-qun.
Please don't come and see me again.

703
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,676
What are you doing?
You were so different a moment ago.

704
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,718
You're right.
I was forced to make love with you.

705
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,756
I don't know you.

706
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,076
Kitty.

707
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,515
I'm Shang Hil-qun, from Singapore.

708
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,512
I've got the documents to prove it.

709
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,550
- Take it back.
- You're lying!

710
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,756
You're Kitty, don't deny it.

711
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,990
I am not!

712
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,555
"See you in the car park. Kitty."

713
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,997
Are you really Kitty?

714
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:05,279
Princess, you didn't seem
to make love to me.

715
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:11,598
You enjoyed it so much,
how can you say that?

716
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,435
You're holding me...

717
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,273
but you're thinking of her.

718
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,396
So what?

719
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,912
When did you start getting jealous?

720
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,232
If you don't fancy her,
why haven't you killed her?

721
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,876
You're not listening to me.

722
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:47,917
You know what happens
when you disobey me, don't you?!

723
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,072
I want her so badly.

724
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,478
Why didn't you admit
that you were Kitty?

725
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:15,030
Because I'm a professional killer
and you're a cop.

726
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:19,238
My boss thinks you'll blow my cover.
That's why she wants to kill you.

727
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,150
Sister Cindy's your boss, isn't she?

728
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:29,119
If i hadn't been in the car park,
you would be dead already.

729
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:34,833
Those traceless murder cases,
were they all done by you?

730
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,673
Everyone we kill deserves to die.

731
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,718
Only my senior
will kill innocent people.

732
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,314
What do you want to do from now on?

733
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:48,393
Either you give up your job
or i give up mine.

734
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,716
Or we forget each other.

735
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,439
Does your boss
really want to kill me?

736
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,476
I'll talk to her.

737
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,633
This isn't the time
to talk about this.

738
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,715
I'll talk to Sister Cindy.

739
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:29,351
- If anything happens, get out fast.
- She's only a woman.

740
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,591
How can you help me?
Show me how you handle a gun!

741
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,998
Sister Cindy.

742
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,594
You haven't visited me
for a long time.

743
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,555
You're heartless.

744
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,072
Is she my junior?

745
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,712
She's very pretty.

746
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:17,032
She's the one
I always talk about, Princess.

747
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,239
This is Baby.

748
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,914
Baby, say hi to them.

749
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,988
- This is Tinam.
- I've seen him before.

750
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,991
When did you see me before?

751
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,316
I've seen all of you!

752
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:55,108
Sister Cindy said
you're even better than me.

753
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,555
She must be joking.

754
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:01,076
Having two students like you,
I think i can retire now.

755
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,832
You can't say that.

756
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,832
You can't say, "I'm retiring"
and then that's it.

757
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:11,198
You should be pleased
that i came straight to visit you

758
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,236
after i arrived in Hong Kong.

759
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,630
But once i leave your house,

760
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,676
we might be enemies.

761
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,669
I know.

762
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,594
My dear junior, I think
you and I will be the best partners.

763
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:31,798
We can kill anyone,
but no one can kill us.

764
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,475
What sort of bullshit is that?

765
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,120
If you don't try me
you'll never know.

766
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,350
Whatever men can do,

767
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,432
I can do better.

768
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,470
Are you all right?

769
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,790
I'm all right. She's a killer.

770
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,638
Yours is too small,
how can you compete with me?

771
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,354
Sister Cindy, we're leaving.

772
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,591
- Can i kiss you before i leave?
- Sister Cindy!

773
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,278
Sure!

774
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,396
Baby, let's go.

775
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,193
Stop it.

776
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:03,671
She's my student,
I know all her tricks.

777
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:10,069
From now on, she'll come back
any time. You can go now.

778
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,269
Sister Cindy, Tinam and I...

779
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,999
I can't even save myself -
how can i kill him?

780
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,833
- I want to stay and help you.
- What can you do?

781
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,515
You've lost the killer's touch.
You're not a good killer any more.

782
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,795
- I...
- Enough!

783
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,836
Killers can never fall in love.

784
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,957
Once they fall in love they go soft.

785
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,793
Then they can easily
be killed by their enemies.

786
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,835
Go now.

787
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,230
- Why don't you call the police?
- Call the police?

788
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,148
I've killed lots of people.

789
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,949
Should the cops arrest her,
or arrest me?

790
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:52,119
I've put your dowry
inside that pillar.

791
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,555
Come back and get it when it's safe.

792
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,959
Sister Cindy.

793
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,270
Fine! Let's go!

794
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,998
Why were you driving so fast?

795
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,548
I want to drop you off
in a safe place quickly.

796
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,154
Now we're in a safe place.

797
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,799
I'm sorry!

798
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,474
Come out! I've been waiting for you.

799
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,870
Sister Cindy, you're still very fit.

800
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,918
I have to keep fit
as long as you're alive.

801
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,880
- Are you in a lot of pain?
- Why?

802
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,518
You taught me.

803
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,479
Killers should never fall in love
and let others know their habits.

804
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:53,158
I don't know why this is happening.
That wine's just been opened.

805
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:57,836
The wine's fine. But do you remember
I kissed you before I left?

806
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:02,232
My lipstick mixed with your wine
is a deadly poison.

807
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,754
So you're poisoned, but I'm not.

808
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,038
You're so cruel!

809
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,875
You can't even shoot a cripple!
Useless!

810
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,037
Sister Cindy, I've found that...

811
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,031
your legs are getting
prettier and prettier.

812
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,872
What a lovely pair of legs!

813
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,070
What are you doing?
You want to commit suicide? No way!

814
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,079
Sister Cindy.

815
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:13,109
You're a perfect
and beautiful killer.

816
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:18,069
Do you know you've only got
ten more minutes to live?

817
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,875
Have you two shagged
any great killers before?

818
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:29,158
- Not yet!
- You piece of shit! Go to hell!

819
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:35,679
If you're quick enough,
you could screw her ten times.

820
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,950
Sister Cindy, enjoy it!

821
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,836
Let's go.

822
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,476
Sister Cindy!

823
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,075
Tell me what happened.

824
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,196
Who did this to you?

825
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,840
Tell me, Sister Cindy?

826
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,272
What do you want?

827
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,078
No!

828
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,640
Sister Cindy!

829
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,917
Kitty, I'll be dead
by the time you watch this video

830
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,797
but don't feel sad for me.

831
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,516
Every killer ends up like this.

832
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,194
I'm very happy
that you've found your true love.

833
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:43,033
Don't get revenge for me,
you can't beat Princess.

834
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:47,033
Because you've fallen in love
and Princess loves no one.

835
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:51,079
Here are some photos for you,
leave here as quickly as you can.

836
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,912
Sister Cindy!

837
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,718
Princess!

838
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,355
You didn't lock the door again.

839
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,834
It doesn't matter
whether i lock the door or not.

840
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,756
Can't you get up?

841
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:15,118
That girl's mysterious! She can
appear and disappear at any time.

842
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:19,557
She's killed lots of people. If you
carry on like this, you'll be next.

843
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,229
- Do you think I'm happy without her?
- I think you look like shit!

844
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:34,433
I'd rather be killed by her.
At least, I'd be happier.

845
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,875
Stop it! You're nuts!

846
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,679
Let's eat first.
I brought some chicken.

847
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,715
Dickhead, are you my friend?
You have to help me.

848
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,752
They've taken your gun
so you're on holiday!

849
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,831
It'll be very dangerous.

850
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,276
I don't care about the gun,
I can't even hold it.

851
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,835
Where are you going?

852
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:06,198
I want to get an informer.
I want to know where Kitty is.

853
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,918
Come here!

854
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,672
Boss, what's the matter?

855
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,960
Boss, I'm making a killing
on the horses!

856
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,429
You'll lose everything, bastard.

857
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,317
Have you seen this girl?

858
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:27,319
This girl? Everyone's looking for
her. Does she owe you lots of money?

859
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,674
Who else?

860
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:32,309
A lesbian is willing to pay
a shit load to find out where she is.

861
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:36,279
- Where can we find that lesbian?
- She's often at the gym.

862
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,795
Loser, go and eat shit!

863
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,029
Yes, I'll eat shit.

864
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,556
Yes, I'll eat shit.

865
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,119
- What's up?
- Someone wants to see Princess.

866
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,555
Baby, see who it is.

867
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,511
- Who is it?
- Kitty wants to see Princess.

868
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,558
- Bring her in.
- Yes, Princess.

869
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,788
- You've come at last.
- Are you looking for me?

870
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:26,431
Come on, do you think
you can escape from me?

871
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,392
Aren't you looking for me?

872
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,510
Look at you!

873
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,068
You're dressing like a hooker.

874
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,116
Tasteless!

875
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,830
You don't like it, do you?

876
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,150
I love it!

877
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:06,155
I love the way you look tarty!

878
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,556
Princess...

879
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:17,791
Listen, obey me...

880
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,400
or I'll poke your eyes out!

881
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,756
- Wait for me downstairs.
- I'll wait for you.

882
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,636
This is for you.

883
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:46,993
How did you know I'd come?

884
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:51,517
I ask them to bring a bunch
of fresh flowers every 12 hours.

885
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,553
I knew you'd come sooner or later.

886
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,118
Do you like it?

887
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,912
It's very pretty.
It must have cost you a lot.

888
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:21,429
There's people everywhere,
there's money everywhere, too.

889
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,836
Money's no big deal!

890
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:29,152
If anything looks good on you,

891
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:33,198
I'll get it for you any way i can.

892
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:39,589
I want to be your partner
but i haven't promised you anything.

893
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:43,630
- Besides...
- What?

894
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:47,872
Besides...
you've got a close girlfriend.

895
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,350
How can she compete with you?

896
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,878
Aren't you worried
that i might be here to kill you?

897
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:32,394
I've searched you.
You've got a lipstick, nothing else.

898
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,396
Stop, what are you doing here?

899
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,393
Go on! Quick!

900
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,270
Let go of her!

901
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:03,038
You feel sick when you hold a gun,
don't you?

902
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,630
Are you feeling funny?

903
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,911
Don't make me pull the trigger!

904
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,675
Go on, throw up! You'll feel better.

905
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,353
Come with me!

906
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,835
Princess will find us
no matter where we go.

907
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:04,196
- What should we do, then?
- Go to Sister Cindy's house.

908
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,992
All right.

909
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:28,153
Tinam, we haven't a chance.
You'd better leave me.

910
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:31,152
I tried so hard to find you.
I won't lose you again.

911
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:34,550
- If you die, I'll die with you.
- Princess is coming, wait here.

912
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,471
Be careful!

913
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,993
You didn't expect the ring
to explode, did you?

914
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:06,868
You're still very inexperienced.

915
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,111
I'll show you how to become
a better killer.

916
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:14,318
Now i see, you got on very well
with Sister Cindy.

917
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:18,356
So you want to die
in the same place as her.

918
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:24,390
But i won't let you die...
until I've had you.

919
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:37,640
Does it taste good?

920
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:40,234
I learnt this from you.

921
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,393
My lipstick is poisoned.

922
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,316
You didn't expect that, did you?

923
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:54,076
Let me tell you something -
I'm also poisoned, but I'll survive.

924
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:58,950
I've drunk lots of milk which can
delay the poison entering my blood.

925
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,031
You've got wounds, so you're dead!

926
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:05,918
I still have time to have
my stomach pumped. But you don't!

927
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,233
Kitty!

928
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:17,068
Kitty! I'll take you to hospital!

929
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:21,799
One of my legs is broken
and I'm poisoned.

930
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:24,110
I won't survive.

931
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:27,556
Kitty! Turn yourself in.

932
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,755
Do you want a cripple
to go to prison?

933
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,080
Listen, you're all surrounded.

934
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:41,435
Sir, Tinam is inside.

935
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:45,036
This house is filled with gas now.

936
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:48,078
If they open fire,
the whole place will explode.

937
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:50,116
You'd better go! Quick!

938
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,511
I tried so hard to find you.

939
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,158
If you die,

940
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:57,196
I'll die with you.
