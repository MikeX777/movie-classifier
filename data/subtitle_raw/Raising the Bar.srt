- Jess?
- Yeah.

Jess is basically a jerk.
You know what I mean?

to Floruit.

with my parents.

for some vinegar.

with one of the guy gymnasts

training at the gym.

Then there's Ashley.

She envies Jess,
like, huge, like...

278
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:37,263
And is Jess' right-hand girl.

279

They've been friends
for years, but

280
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:40,918

Like, Ashley's a good gymnast

282
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:44,835
but she just doesn't have
Jess' talent

283
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,509
so she can't quite get
to be the head girl

284
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:49,275

for the next best.

289
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:59,391
She never really quite got
the rhythmic stuff

290
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:02,810
she just kept dropping the ball
and getting tangled.

291
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:05,247
Dropping the ball
and getting tangled?

292
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,683
Yeah, literally.

Like, great lines,
flexible, strong

294
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:11,862
but she couldn't quite grasp

295
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:13,864
the extra co-ordination needed.

296
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:15,823
Her coach said
she should try artistic.

297
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,694
Sam's easy-going,
like, always be nice

298
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:22,003
but she's in Jess' elite little
group nowadays and...

299
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,285

as well.

He was in an elite program,
but quit.

He likes performing and singing.
He's pretty good, too.

He juggles doing gym,
singing and acting lessons

314
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,472

part of a band. Not sure.

keen on him though.

about Jess, yeah?

she broke it off.

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,349

any distractions.

have all been in gymnastics.

was an awesome gymnast

Uh, hey, so what's, what's your
story? What are you all about?

342
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,508
Best part, you see, I was a
trampolinist, but I wanted a change.

343
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:17,553
See, I always wanted
to do artistic gymnastics

344
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:19,076
but because
I've come into it late

345
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,514
I don't really have the control
like the others.

346
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:22,950
That's why
I'm in the seconds gym

347
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:25,692
trying to get
as much training as I can.

348
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:27,302
Well, that's what
Jess told me to do.

349
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,478
She keeps describing me as,
like, out of control

350
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:31,915
which, I mean, I just don't get,
like, what does she mean?

to make it on my own

without any sort
of special treatment

drag the team down?

What are you talking about?

You're the best gymnast

You're just
saying that because...

There are strong club teams
again this year

Beautiful routine from Kelly.

921
01:00:38,896 --> 01:00:43,161
Will she try and pull out
a big move in this last part?

922
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:51,343
[FEMALE #5]
No, it's just a front layout

923
01:00:51,386 --> 01:00:53,301

on the landing base.

time with that final pass, Michelle.

My last two comps
weren't that good

seems to forget

stepped out of bounds so much

in competitions

between him and my mom.

too much pressure on me.

to my full potential.

all the time.

blew really big tumbling pass

they had a huge fight.

that spot on the team
