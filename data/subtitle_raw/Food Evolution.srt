00:00:44,557 --> 00:00:48,392
<i>The survival of our species
has always depended on advances</i>

3
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:50,262
<i>in food and agriculture.</i>

4
00:00:52,697 --> 00:00:56,667
<i>There are 7.3 billion
people on the planet.</i>

5
00:00:56,669 --> 00:00:58,869
<i>The world's population is expected</i>

6
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:03,575
<i>to top 9 billion in 2050.</i>

7
00:01:03,577 --> 00:01:06,410
<i>Climate change is gonna
scramble this whole</i>

8
00:01:06,412 --> 00:01:09,446
<i>"How are we gonna feed
the world?" debate.</i>

9
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:17,488
<i>This is all about companies
controlling our future.</i>

10
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:26,863
<i>So amongst all this
conflict and confusion,</i>

11
00:01:26,865 --> 00:01:29,901
<i>how do we make the
most informed decisions</i>

12
00:01:29,903 --> 00:01:33,003
<i>about how we feed ourselves?</i>

13
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:08,240
<i>We are at a pivotal time in
the history of this island.</i>

14
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:11,742
I have a bill before the council

15
00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:14,879
that would restrict the use of GMOs.

16
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:18,617
The point is that we have
an opportunity to act.

17
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:22,420
To do something. We would
make history on this island.

18
00:02:22,422 --> 00:02:26,391
Let's make this island a model
for the rest of the world.

19
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:28,492
Thank you.

20
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:43,673
I am concerned about
some of the health issues

21
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:47,611
related to GMOs on a
number of different levels.

22
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:51,550
My approach was, "Hey.

23
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:53,451
"We're gonna close the door on this island.

24
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:55,052
"You don't come here

25
00:02:55,054 --> 00:02:59,790
<i>until we have more
information of what is safe."</i>

26
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:01,724
<i>There's a lot going
on on this island.</i>

27
00:03:01,726 --> 00:03:03,829
This is ground zero for the entire world

28
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:08,700
in terms of experimentation
of GMOs and seed production.

29
00:03:10,602 --> 00:03:13,238
This is a really rare opportunity

30
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,841
to get shots of people spraying.

31
00:03:19,913 --> 00:03:22,814
<i>We, as a society, do
so many stupid things,</i>

32
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:24,214
and I feel like the GMO

33
00:03:24,216 --> 00:03:27,385
is a thoughtless invasive species

34
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:29,622
that is being brought in here.

35
00:03:29,624 --> 00:03:31,756
<i>If they're safe,
great. Bring your jobs.</i>

36
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:34,058
You know, the more the merrier.

37
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,594
If you're helping the island,
if you're really feeding people,

38
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:39,362
then you're more than
welcome. They're not farmers.

39
00:03:39,364 --> 00:03:41,533
They're mad scientists.

40
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:45,068
<i>No GMO!</i>

41
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,339
<i>With this conflict over
genetically modified organisms,</i>

42
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:51,541
<i>Hawaii has become
ground zero of a battle</i>

43
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:54,844
<i>for how to feed the
world sustainably.</i>

44
00:03:57,718 --> 00:04:01,618
<i>A long day of testimony on
two proposed laws prohibiting</i>

45
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,556
<i>genetically modified
organisms on Hawaii Island.</i>

46
00:04:05,558 --> 00:04:08,092
<i>Before voting, the
Hawaii county council</i>

47
00:04:08,094 --> 00:04:10,996
<i>tried to get answers
about any safety concerns</i>

48
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:12,965
<i>related to GMOs.</i>

49
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:18,101
Okay. I'm calling this
meeting back to order.

50
00:04:18,103 --> 00:04:19,337
Aloha, Mr. Smith.

51
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,573
- Or, is it Dr. Smith?
- <i>Aloha.</i>

52
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:24,407
<i>No, Jeffery's fine.</i>

53
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:27,378
Have you ever heard of the rainbow papaya?

54
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,180
<i>Oh, yes. I am very aware</i>

55
00:04:29,182 --> 00:04:33,183
<i>that eating papaya that's
genetically engineered might</i>

56
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:35,352
<i>cause you to get more colds,</i>

57
00:04:35,354 --> 00:04:38,823
<i>more susceptibility
to hepatitis or HIV.</i>

58
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:41,560
<i>And again, these are
completely backed</i>

59
00:04:41,562 --> 00:04:43,895
<i>with peer-reviewed,
published studies.</i>

60
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:48,299
<i>We've actually put the
population at risk.</i>

61
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:51,601
Here in Hilo

62
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:53,671
Most of this testimony is very emotional.

63
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:57,474
Everybody is saying that GMOs
are dangerous, but they're not.

64
00:04:57,476 --> 00:04:59,210
There's not a single credible study.

65
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:00,810
<i>It's caused by people</i>

66
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:04,883
who are intentionally
making other people scared.

67
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:09,621
For the people who make
their living growing GMOs,

68
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:12,690
you know the Hawaiian...
everybody here is very giving,

69
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:16,128
and they would probably bend over backwards

70
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,661
to help you burn those papayas

71
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:20,632
and grow something decent.

72
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:24,702
The face of this issue is
not the papaya. You know.

73
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:28,938
The face of this issue is these
huge multinational companies.

74
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,108
That's what you guys are dealing with.

75
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,746
One of the criticisms that
I receive: "Okay, Margaret,

76
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:37,582
"this is... you're anti-progress.

77
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:39,084
You are anti-science."

78
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:40,517
What, I say to that is,

79
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:43,087
you know, who's really being unscientific?

80
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:47,224
A study by French molecular
biologist Gilles-Eric Séralini

81
00:05:47,226 --> 00:05:48,659
provides solid evidence

82
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:52,162
showing rats fed GMOs
sprayed with glyphosate,

83
00:05:52,164 --> 00:05:53,931
the toxic Roundup herbicide,

84
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,299
developed serious tumors

85
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:56,899
that took over their bodies.

86
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:59,337
The biggest risk associated with today's

87
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:00,938
genetically engineered crops,

88
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,673
<i>these so-called
"Roundup Ready" crops,</i>

89
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:07,611
is this significant
increase in pesticide use.

90
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:10,382
<i>There's remarkable
correlations between the use</i>

91
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:11,916
<i>of glyphosate on GMOs</i>

92
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,017
<i>and the rates of autism in America.</i>

93
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:17,822
<i>Also of obesity, and
diabetes, and Alzheimer's.</i>

94
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:20,157
<i>All of these things correlate
very, very strongly.</i>

95
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,359
<i>So I think, eventually,
the only solution that's</i>

96
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:25,762
<i>actually going to work in the
long run is to go organic.</i>

97
00:06:25,764 --> 00:06:27,632
Thank you.

98
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:31,534
How many scientists are
here in the audience?

99
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:33,005
Please raise your hand.

100
00:06:34,308 --> 00:06:37,106
With degrees.

101
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:40,577
I just want facts.

102
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:42,512
True facts. Without the fear.

103
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:43,914
Without anything else.

104
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,649
Facts. And we can make the best decision

105
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:47,317
when we have facts.

106
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,719
I yield.

107
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:53,390
I'm Dennis Gonsalves,
who actually very proudly

108
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:55,094
developed the rainbow papaya.

109
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:58,828
If you say you don't want to use GMOs

110
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,332
because you don't believe
in manipulating plants

111
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,299
the way the process does,

112
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:05,169
<i>I respect your belief.</i>

113
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:08,906
<i>But now, if you say,
"GMOs are not safe,"</i>

114
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:12,676
I would say, "Now, show me the data."

115
00:07:12,678 --> 00:07:18,082
There's absolutely no
proof to the health hazard.

116
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:19,616
Absolutely no proof.

117
00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:22,320
Talk is very cheap,
but we did the research.

118
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:24,121
And I stand by it.

119
00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:30,260
- Thank you. We're...
- Boo!

120
00:07:30,262 --> 00:07:32,296
I was a former biology major,

121
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:35,666
so I have some expertise in this area.

122
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:37,068
There is no middle ground.

123
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,671
You're either gonna be GMO allowing...

124
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:42,371
GMO... or you're gonna be organic

125
00:07:42,373 --> 00:07:44,142
and not allow GMO.

126
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:45,743
They cannot coexist.

127
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:48,279
Thank you very much. Then, Madame Clerk,

128
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:50,782
on motion to approve Bill 113,

129
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:53,517
Draft 3, at second and final reading.

130
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,286
- Aye.
- No.

131
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:57,154
- Aye.
- Aye.

132
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:58,354
- Aye.
- No.

133
00:07:58,356 --> 00:07:59,724
- Aye.
- Aye.

134
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:02,060
You have six ayes.

135
00:08:02,062 --> 00:08:05,094
- Thank you.
- Bill 113 is adopted.

136
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:09,700
Motion to adjourn.

137
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:11,803
You know, I said,

138
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:15,205
"You're not gonna get away
with it if I can help it."

139
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:17,875
And we stopped it.

140
00:08:19,644 --> 00:08:22,279
<i>Hawaii's ban on genetically
modified organisms</i>

141
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:25,616
<i>and the frightening evidence
presented during testimony</i>

142
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:28,019
made headlines around the world.

143
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,255
<i>It was also hailed as a rallying cry</i>

144
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:35,459
<i>by the global leaders in
the movement against GMOs.</i>

145
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:40,231
I think your island is
truth speaking to the world

146
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:44,101
that GMOs are an extension of pesticides,

147
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:46,971
not a substitute and alternative to it.

148
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:49,707
So don't tell me Monsanto can't be beaten.

149
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:53,376
They've been beat over
and over and over again.

150
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:57,515
<i>And we can do it again.
Organic isn't the ceiling.</i>

151
00:08:57,517 --> 00:08:59,048
Organic's the floor.

152
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,918
And above that, we build
this new house of food.

153
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,620
This is actually a movement

154
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:04,287
which is spreading across the country.

155
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:06,023
Speaking to you all the
way from Moscow, Margaret.

156
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,558
<i>Why this ban?</i>

157
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,559
<i>We want to protect
the future generations</i>

158
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:11,294
<i>from the contamination.</i>

159
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:14,732
Do not want any more GMO
species on this island. Period.

160
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:17,266
You could get your kids sick!

161
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:20,271
<i>But what if, while trying
to do the right thing,</i>

162
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:23,842
<i>the council got it wrong?</i>

163
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:27,211
It's very frustrating to see
people who don't even know

164
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:30,515
what this breeding method is making choices

165
00:09:30,517 --> 00:09:33,116
to avoid it based on information

166
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:36,154
that's not supported by
the scientific literature.

167
00:09:37,956 --> 00:09:39,991
You might think the three
most terrifying letters

168
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:42,025
in the English language are GMO.

169
00:09:42,027 --> 00:09:44,727
So I wondered how many people
really know what they are.

170
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:47,598
What does GMO stand for?

171
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,933
G... GM... I don't know.

172
00:09:49,935 --> 00:09:51,002
Aw, man.

173
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:54,337
It... it's a genetically modif... modi...

174
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:55,704
I don't know. What is it?

175
00:09:55,706 --> 00:09:57,308
I know it's bad, but,

176
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,943
to be completely honest
with you, I have no idea.

177
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:00,711
<i>A GMO is really an undefined term.</i>

178
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:02,480
<i>It's a genetically
modified organism,</i>

179
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:05,515
and I might argue that a
Chihuahua and a Great Dane

180
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,250
are a genetically modified relative

181
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:09,087
to their ancestor, the wolf.

182
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:13,924
A GMO is an organism that's
had its genetic makeup altered

183
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:16,327
<i>by the insertion of DNA</i>

184
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:21,365
<i>that's from outside of
its normal genetic makeup.</i>

185
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:24,236
<i>So what does that really mean?</i>

186
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:26,871
<i>At its most basic,
genetic engineering,</i>

187
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:31,009
<i>or, as some say, GE, is
a modern form of breeding</i>

188
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:34,244
<i>which farmers have done for
thousands of years to select</i>

189
00:10:34,246 --> 00:10:37,414
<i>for the most desirable
traits and provide food</i>

190
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,717
<i>for a growing population.</i>

191
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:41,486
<i>In fact, it's hard to call</i>

192
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:43,153
<i>any of our food "natural."</i>

193
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:45,755
<i>Conventional, as well
as organic, crops</i>

194
00:10:45,757 --> 00:10:47,925
<i>have all been genetically modified</i>

195
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:50,226
<i>through selective breeding.</i>

196
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:52,063
The goal of genetic engineering

197
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:56,500
is to add useful traits into food.

198
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:59,202
<i>Traits that currently
help with weed, insect,</i>

199
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:02,273
<i>and disease control in staple crops</i>

200
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:05,976
<i>that are in billions of
meals consumed every day.</i>

201
00:11:05,978 --> 00:11:09,013
<i>In fact, genetic engineering
has been part of our lives</i>

202
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:11,048
<i>for longer than most are aware.</i>

203
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,116
<i>Probably the most
familiar is insulin.</i>

204
00:11:13,118 --> 00:11:15,019
<i>Genetically engineered insulin.</i>

205
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:17,321
It's been very important for patients

206
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:19,457
suffering from diabetes.

207
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:23,059
<i>Biotechnology is kind of used
in almost all cheesemaking now.</i>

208
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:24,696
So if you're eating cheese,

209
00:11:24,698 --> 00:11:26,496
you're eating a product of biotechnology.

210
00:11:26,498 --> 00:11:29,098
<i>Scientists are also working
to genetically engineer seeds</i>

211
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,101
<i>that aid humanitarian causes,</i>

212
00:11:31,103 --> 00:11:35,840
<i>such as vitamin-enrichment
in crops like golden rice.</i>

213
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:37,274
<i>Golden rice is rice engineered</i>

214
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:39,042
<i>to have high levels
of beta carotene,</i>

215
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:41,077
<i>which gets turned into vitamin A.</i>

216
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:43,148
And it's been proposed many years ago

217
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,684
as a solution for vitamin A deficiency

218
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:48,486
in the developing world.

219
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:50,486
<i>In addition to helping
millions of children</i>

220
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:53,357
<i>stave off potentially
fatal vitamin deficiencies,</i>

221
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,726
<i>scientists are also developing crops</i>

222
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:57,528
<i>with a tolerance for drought,</i>

223
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,997
<i>such as rice, corn, and wheat,</i>

224
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:01,664
<i>which could prove essential</i>

225
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,000
<i>in the face of climate change.</i>

226
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:06,035
<i>And disease resistance,</i>

227
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:08,005
<i>to save crops like
the Hawaiian papaya</i>

228
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:11,308
<i>from being completely wiped out.</i>

229
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:18,981
<i>In fact, the farmers who
grow this rainbow papaya</i>

230
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:21,151
<i>convinced the Hawaii council</i>

231
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:25,288
<i>to amend their ban on GMOs.</i>

232
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,558
<i>Papaya industry farmers
flooded the council chamber...</i>

233
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,465
To insinuate GMO is somehow
unhealthy is just not true.

234
00:12:42,943 --> 00:12:44,409
I need your help.

235
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:46,009
<i>Those of us who live
on the Big Island</i>

236
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:47,778
should be well aware

237
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,947
that agricultural biotechnology

238
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:53,418
has saved the papaya
industry on this island.

239
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,252
<i>It's been reported
that Councilwoman Wille</i>

240
00:12:56,254 --> 00:12:58,020
<i>plans to amend the bill further.</i>

241
00:12:58,022 --> 00:12:59,790
And that approach is the way I've done it.

242
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:03,360
Which is, basically, to grandfather in,

243
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:05,929
number one, the papaya as an industry.

244
00:13:05,931 --> 00:13:09,733
It's impractical to just
say no at this point.

245
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:14,038
If there are such horrible
health issues related to GMOs,

246
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,807
why even exempt the rainbow papaya?

247
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:17,509
Why not try to get it off your island?

248
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:19,275
Like, well, you must
have thought about that?

249
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:24,048
Okay, I did, and there was
a lot of criticism of me

250
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,950
and my final bill.

251
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:28,520
We... if we as a body pass this,

252
00:13:28,522 --> 00:13:33,824
it shows that we think
that all GMOs are wrong.

253
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:37,895
Except this, this, this, this, this.

254
00:13:37,897 --> 00:13:39,831
Are you worried that rainbow papaya

255
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,331
could cause somebody to have...

256
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,802
I don't know. You know. I have no idea.

257
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:50,174
This exempts everyone.
However, we think it's wrong.

258
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:51,909
What's the number one, like, problem...

259
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:53,943
You know what? You keep focusing on papaya,

260
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:56,114
and I exempted... you know?

261
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:58,981
I exempted it. So it's
like you're home free.

262
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:00,651
So I don't...

263
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:03,886
At the same time, I wanted
to get a bill passed.

264
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:09,491
It's done!

265
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:12,764
<i>While the evidence presented
before the council seemed strong</i>

266
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:15,499
<i>and scary enough to ban all GMOs,</i>

267
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:18,302
<i>they exempted the rainbow papaya,</i>

268
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:21,505
<i>a genetically engineered fix
that helped this cherished crop</i>

269
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:25,375
<i>come back from the dead
only a short time ago.</i>

270
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:28,480
<i>Twenty years ago,</i>

271
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:31,414
<i>the Big Island papaya
industry had been thriving.</i>

272
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:36,853
<i>Growers were shipping 60 million
pounds of papayas a year.</i>

273
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:39,191
<i>But then insects began spreading</i>

274
00:14:39,193 --> 00:14:42,192
<i>a devastating virus called ringspot</i>

275
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:45,396
<i>to nearly every papaya
tree on the island.</i>

276
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:49,333
<i>In about three years,
the trees were dead,</i>

277
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:53,770
<i>the industry literally wiped out.</i>

278
00:14:53,772 --> 00:14:56,274
<i>Nothing stopped the spread.</i>

279
00:14:56,276 --> 00:14:58,908
<i>Not physical barriers.
Not pesticides.</i>

280
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:04,581
<i>No methods, conventional nor
organic, could halt the virus.</i>

281
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:08,318
<i>As a scientist, when
nothing seems to be working,</i>

282
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,654
<i>you have to think of
alternative solutions.</i>

283
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:13,923
<i>And I had this idea.</i>

284
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:18,196
<i>The idea of vaccinating a plant</i>

285
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:20,264
<i>through genetic engineering.</i>

286
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:23,467
<i>What we did is, we
took the hypothesis.</i>

287
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:27,270
<i>We isolated a gene
from the pathogen.</i>

288
00:15:27,272 --> 00:15:31,908
<i>We cloned the gene using
recombinant DNA technology.</i>

289
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,845
<i>We used a gene gun</i>

290
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:37,179
<i>to introduce our clone genes</i>

291
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:39,784
<i>into the cells of the papaya.</i>

292
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:42,519
<i>And it doesn't work the
first two or three times,</i>

293
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:45,689
<i>so you have to repeat
these experiments.</i>

294
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:49,358
<i>And it took us seven
years of research.</i>

295
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,329
<i>We continue until we're satisfied</i>

296
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:55,566
<i>that we have the correct sequence.</i>

297
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:58,134
<i>Now, this is the scientific method,</i>

298
00:15:58,136 --> 00:16:00,703
<i>and you have to verify your results.</i>

299
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:04,241
<i>A few years later, our
results were dramatic.</i>

300
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:07,578
<i>The non-genetically engineered
papaya is not growing;</i>

301
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,515
<i>the genetically engineered
papaya is growing.</i>

302
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:15,752
<i>So we concluded that this
genetically engineered papaya</i>

303
00:16:15,754 --> 00:16:18,923
<i>that we had was resistant.</i>

304
00:16:18,925 --> 00:16:23,127
We released seeds to the growers for free.

305
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:27,896
Essentially, we saved the papaya industry.

306
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:29,466
That's it.

307
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:32,836
<i>Today, the industry is thriving,</i>

308
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:37,340
<i>exporting rainbow papaya to
countries all over the world.</i>

309
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:39,175
<i>But as more and more people</i>

310
00:16:39,177 --> 00:16:41,511
<i>enjoyed this genetically
engineered fruit,</i>

311
00:16:41,513 --> 00:16:44,146
<i>a vocal movement began to rise up</i>

312
00:16:44,148 --> 00:16:48,650
<i>against the very
process that saved it.</i>

313
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:52,021
Here they come. Genetically
engineered tomatoes.

314
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:54,290
We're creating a whole new species,

315
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:56,459
one that's never existed on Earth before.

316
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:59,929
So some would say,
"You've created a monster.

317
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:01,799
A Frankenfood!"

318
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:04,967
These foods can create new allergies.

319
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:07,104
They can make a nontoxic food toxic.

320
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:08,305
They can lower immune response.

321
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:10,207
They do lower nutrition.

322
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:12,810
<i>The gap between the
public and science</i>

323
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:15,644
<i>on the safety of GMOs
is the largest gap</i>

324
00:17:15,646 --> 00:17:20,251
<i>of any politicized scientific topic.</i>

325
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:23,754
I have always been careful not to say,

326
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,957
"This is dangerous food."

327
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,459
And I don't believe the
fear mongering has helped.

328
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:31,762
Okay, good. So that's a good control.

329
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:34,598
I think it's a really important
concept of scientific consensus.

330
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,200
So you never trust one
scientist or one opinion.

331
00:17:38,202 --> 00:17:41,304
You look at the consensus of experts

332
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:44,373
in the field over 20, 30 years.

333
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,143
<i>After 30 years of
testing every GMO product</i>

334
00:17:47,145 --> 00:17:48,812
<i>currently on the market</i>

335
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:52,249
<i>and based on the results of
nearly 2,000 experiments,</i>

336
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:54,784
<i>the foremost scientific institutions</i>

337
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:56,285
<i>in the United States</i>

338
00:17:56,287 --> 00:17:58,121
<i>and around the world have concluded,</i>

339
00:17:58,123 --> 00:18:01,524
<i>"All criticisms against
GMOs can be largely rejected</i>

340
00:18:01,526 --> 00:18:05,328
<i>on strictly scientific criteria."</i>

341
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,032
I don't think that
genetically modified organisms

342
00:18:08,034 --> 00:18:09,734
are dangerous to consume.

343
00:18:09,736 --> 00:18:11,200
We don't have any evidence

344
00:18:11,202 --> 00:18:13,437
that the products that
are on the market now

345
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,372
have caused particular harm.

346
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:16,774
<i>No adverse health effects</i>

347
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:18,675
<i>attributed to genetic engineering</i>

348
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:21,011
<i>have been documented in
the human population.</i>

349
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:22,478
I looked closely at health,

350
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,448
and then I went into environmental effects.

351
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,785
And I just kind of ran out of
things to... to worry about.

352
00:18:29,787 --> 00:18:32,621
<i>"The science is quite clear:
crop improvement by the modern</i>

353
00:18:32,623 --> 00:18:36,927
<i>molecular techniques of
biotechnology is safe."</i>

354
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:40,228
<i>While each new product should
continue to be assessed</i>

355
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,432
<i>on a case-by-case
basis,</i>

356
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:44,501
<i>scientific consensus tells us</i>

357
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:48,471
<i>the current GMOs on the
market are safe to eat</i>

358
00:18:48,473 --> 00:18:50,707
<i>and safe for the environment.</i>

359
00:18:57,248 --> 00:19:02,252
<i>There's absolutely no
proof to health hazard.</i>

360
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:06,156
<i>We did the research,
and I stand by it.</i>

361
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:08,825
- Boo!
- We're g...

362
00:19:08,827 --> 00:19:12,528
We ought to congratulate Margaret, really.

363
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,233
We were absolutely outmaneuvered.

364
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:16,867
Snookered.

365
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:19,736
Because all the time was
given to Jeffery Smith,

366
00:19:19,738 --> 00:19:21,672
and he ranted and raved.

367
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:26,110
Eating papaya that's
genetically engineered might

368
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:28,210
cause you to get more colds,

369
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:31,947
more... more susceptibility
to hepatitis or HIV.

370
00:19:32,949 --> 00:19:36,052
What Jeffery Smith just said
was convincing, if it was true.

371
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:37,787
- Yeah.
- But he's lying

372
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:39,589
<i>to scare people.</i>

373
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:42,825
Jeffery Smith is a very
innocent-looking person,

374
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:45,394
and he can say things,

375
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:50,265
wild and crazy things that
are astounding to hear,

376
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:51,967
with a very straight face.

377
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:56,305
<i>We now know that GMOs, when
consumed by human beings,</i>

378
00:19:56,307 --> 00:20:00,210
<i>might switch on or
shut off our genes.</i>

379
00:20:00,212 --> 00:20:04,515
<i>It's a theoretical possibility
that has never been evaluated.</i>

380
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:06,816
Things like that. So that's Jeffery Smith.

381
00:20:06,818 --> 00:20:10,521
<i>And I do know he has
a very wide audience.</i>

382
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:12,956
Do you consider yourself a scientist?

383
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,359
I'm not a scientist.

384
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:17,027
Do you... are you a doctor?

385
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:19,161
I'm not a doctor.

386
00:20:19,163 --> 00:20:20,732
- Aloha, Mr. Smith.
- <i>Aloha.</i>

387
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:24,467
- Is it Dr. Smith?
- <i>No, Jeffery's fine.</i>

388
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:26,536
People refer to me as "doctor" all the time

389
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:29,438
and I... because they get it wrong.

390
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,642
I don't call... I don't
call myself a doctor.

391
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,511
I don't call myself a scientist.

392
00:20:33,513 --> 00:20:35,879
And I use my non-scientist...
it's to an advantage,

393
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:37,881
because I get to ask
a lot of dumb questions

394
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:40,350
and hear more and more
people's assumptions.

395
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:42,953
And then I can record them.

396
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:44,487
They were very smart,

397
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:47,489
and they were clever
about misinforming people.

398
00:20:47,491 --> 00:20:49,025
<i>There's remarkable correlations</i>

399
00:20:49,027 --> 00:20:50,460
<i>between the use of GMO</i>

400
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:52,562
<i>and the rates of autism in America.</i>

401
00:20:52,564 --> 00:20:54,665
<i>She showed one slide that,
over the past twenty years</i>

402
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:57,734
or something, the incidents
of autism in the United States,

403
00:20:57,736 --> 00:20:59,536
and how that went up,
up, up, up, up, up, up.

404
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:02,672
And then she superimposed
on that the use of Roundup.

405
00:21:02,674 --> 00:21:04,742
<i>And then in a statement
how it was the...</i>

406
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:06,543
almost exactly a perfect match,
and she said, out loud, that

407
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:08,511
"I have never seen a better correlation."

408
00:21:08,513 --> 00:21:11,547
<i>Remarkable... I have never
seen such a good correlation</i>

409
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:13,515
<i>coefficient as you see
between those two things.</i>

410
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:16,086
<i>So I think the only
solution is to go organic.</i>

411
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:18,955
And if you look at
consumption of organic food,

412
00:21:18,957 --> 00:21:20,523
even a better match.

413
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:23,194
So there's autism prevalence
in the United States,

414
00:21:23,196 --> 00:21:24,694
and organic food sales.

415
00:21:24,696 --> 00:21:26,797
So organic foods, then, cause autism.

416
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,666
Must cause autism.

417
00:21:28,668 --> 00:21:32,535
It became really clear
that... that Brenda Ford

418
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:34,903
and Margaret Wille were not
interested in gathering facts.

419
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:37,372
- Yeah.
- They're interested in getting

420
00:21:37,374 --> 00:21:39,944
their fellow county council people scared.

421
00:21:39,946 --> 00:21:43,447
Bill 113 is adopted.

422
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:45,349
<i>The general nature of these people,</i>

423
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:47,582
they probably all vote Democrat, like me.

424
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:50,854
They're kind of left-leaning, like me.

425
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:53,323
They probably think
global warming is a problem

426
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:54,726
we should take care of, like me.

427
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:57,826
They probably agree with me on most things.

428
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:02,367
<i>And that is another reason
why this battle over GMOs</i>

429
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:05,236
<i>is so complicated and confusing.</i>

430
00:22:05,238 --> 00:22:09,805
<i>Both sides seem to be fighting
for the same, worthwhile goals:</i>

431
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:13,543
<i>safe, abundant,
nutritious food for all...</i>

432
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:15,844
Three generations against GMOs.

433
00:22:15,846 --> 00:22:17,614
- Excellent.
- Thank you.

434
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:21,951
<i>Fewer toxic chemicals
used around the world,</i>

435
00:22:21,953 --> 00:22:25,690
<i>and a more sustainable food system.</i>

436
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,694
These are the victors.

437
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:32,062
In a hundred years, when
they look back and say,

438
00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:34,265
"How did we save the planet?"

439
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:35,399
There you go.

440
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:40,971
<i>But there are
real-world consequences</i>

441
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:43,206
<i>to acting against
scientific consensus</i>

442
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:47,944
<i>that can be felt far beyond
the shores of Hawaii.</i>

443
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,519
<i>Now a Hawaiian island has
passed a law banning companies</i>

444
00:22:56,521 --> 00:22:59,322
<i>which produce
genetically modified food</i>

445
00:22:59,324 --> 00:23:01,426
from operating on its territory.

446
00:23:01,428 --> 00:23:03,160
<i>Marin County, in California.</i>

447
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:05,961
<i>A GMO ban was put on
a ballot and passed.</i>

448
00:23:05,963 --> 00:23:09,064
<i>I'm not here as an expert,
and we all have the right,</i>

449
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:12,570
<i>as Americans, to know
what's in our food.</i>

450
00:23:12,572 --> 00:23:14,138
<i>Vermont passed a bill mandating</i>

451
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,306
<i>genetically modified
foods must be labeled.</i>

452
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:18,942
<i>We don't want your GMOs!</i>

453
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:21,977
<i>Scotland is to ban
genetically modified crops.</i>

454
00:23:23,348 --> 00:23:24,915
<i>I have come to the conclusion</i>

455
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:27,217
<i>that there is a justifiable
reason to believe</i>

456
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:30,153
<i>that this genetically
modified maize presents</i>

457
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:31,853
<i>a danger to the environment.</i>

458
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:34,123
<i>Growing genetically modified food</i>

459
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,592
<i>is banned across the EU.</i>

460
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:38,427
<i>Today, 150,000 farmers in India</i>

461
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:40,564
<i>have committed suicide in areas</i>

462
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:42,998
<i>where they have to buy
the seed from Monsanto.</i>

463
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,967
<i>A devastating drought
hit southern Africa.</i>

464
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:47,503
<i>The American government
sent a shipment of food aid</i>

465
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:49,471
<i>containing GM corn,</i>

466
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:51,274
<i>and Zambia refused it.</i>

467
00:23:51,276 --> 00:23:57,081
<i>Available data shows that
GMO foods can cause harm.</i>

468
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:00,216
<i>Making reference to
the Séralini report.</i>

469
00:24:00,218 --> 00:24:06,121
<i>The government has decided
that all GMO food imports</i>

470
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:08,825
<i>are completely banned.</i>

471
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:11,430
<i>Uganda doesn't need the GMOs.</i>

472
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,233
<i>The fears and decisions</i>

473
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:17,968
<i>about GMOs in Hawaii reach</i>

474
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,603
<i>all the way to Uganda
in east Africa,</i>

475
00:24:20,605 --> 00:24:23,806
<i>where bananas, similar
to the Hawaiian papaya,</i>

476
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,677
<i>are threatened to be wiped
out by a terrible disease.</i>

477
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,014
<i>Most bananas in this
region are now faced</i>

478
00:24:30,016 --> 00:24:32,782
<i>with the worst bacterial
disease so far,</i>

479
00:24:32,784 --> 00:24:34,851
<i>known as Banana Xanthomonas Wilt.</i>

480
00:24:34,853 --> 00:24:37,286
<i>The disease has had
a devastating impact</i>

481
00:24:37,288 --> 00:24:38,821
<i>on banana cultivation,</i>

482
00:24:38,823 --> 00:24:42,725
<i>forcing some farmers
to abandon their crop.</i>

483
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,803
<i>Currently, nearly half of
all banana plants in Uganda</i>

484
00:24:52,805 --> 00:24:54,938
<i>have been wiped out by banana wilt,</i>

485
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,842
<i>threatening the food security
of 14 million Ugandans,</i>

486
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:02,145
<i>more than a third of the population.</i>

487
00:25:20,165 --> 00:25:22,066
Mm-hmm.

488
00:25:34,345 --> 00:25:35,912
Famine.

489
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:37,681
My name is Emma Naluyima Mugerwa.

490
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:40,182
<i>I practice integrated
organic farming.</i>

491
00:25:40,184 --> 00:25:42,852
<i>I also teach farmers
how to do the same.</i>

492
00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:45,487
<i>Right now, banana wilt
is not affecting me,</i>

493
00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:48,292
but it has affected many people.

494
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:52,563
<i>Banana bacteria can spread from
one farm to another at any time.</i>

495
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:55,565
<i>That's why I teach these farmers.</i>

496
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:01,536
My idea... you have to guard against it.

497
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:02,604
Don't let people come into your garden.

498
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:03,908
Don't share tools.

499
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,542
Like, you see that is a tool rack.

500
00:26:06,544 --> 00:26:07,976
All our tools will be used in this garden.

501
00:26:07,978 --> 00:26:10,281
We never use them anywhere else.

502
00:26:10,283 --> 00:26:11,679
If you must,

503
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:13,517
<i>you disinfect.</i>

504
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:17,120
All these are preventive measure.

505
00:26:17,122 --> 00:26:19,590
They're not really curative measures.

506
00:26:59,163 --> 00:27:02,264
<i>She could not get food for
herself or for her family,</i>

507
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:04,501
<i>so she's devastated.</i>

508
00:27:16,315 --> 00:27:19,282
<i>Once someone is hit, you
have to just cut down, burn,</i>

509
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:21,953
<i>and wait for maybe
six months to a year</i>

510
00:27:21,955 --> 00:27:24,956
<i>for it to get out of the garden.</i>

511
00:27:30,062 --> 00:27:33,698
<i>I would call it the
Ebola of the banana.</i>

512
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,034
<i>It comes and wipes away
the whole plantation.</i>

513
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:42,103
<i>To fight the devastation
of banana wilt,</i>

514
00:27:42,105 --> 00:27:45,041
<i>scientists in Uganda
and Kenya are working</i>

515
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:47,110
<i>on a genetically
engineered fix similar</i>

516
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:50,080
<i>to what was done in
Hawaii with papaya.</i>

517
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:53,049
<i>Except their work is
done behind a locked gate</i>

518
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:54,685
<i>and is currently prohibited</i>

519

<i>from being released to the public.</i>

00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,890
<i>Hi. I'm Leena Tripathi.</i>

521
00:28:00,892 --> 00:28:03,325
I'm leading the transgenic
research in IITA,

522
00:28:03,327 --> 00:28:05,996
and my focus is on disease
and pest resistance.

523
00:28:05,998 --> 00:28:08,031
So we find out that there are

524
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:11,001
some resistant genes in sweet pepper.

525
00:28:11,003 --> 00:28:12,701
These are the genes that we are using

526
00:28:12,703 --> 00:28:14,504
to transfer resistance

527
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:16,373
from sweet pepper to banana.

528
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:36,524
<i>This message is brought to
you by Action Aid Uganda.</i>

529
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:39,396
<i>Did you know that genetically
modified organisms</i>

530
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:41,864
<i>pose health risks such as cancer,</i>

531
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:44,501
<i>infertility, et
cetera? The national...</i>

532
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:48,871
<i>I read about rats getting
cancer due to GMOs.</i>

533
00:28:48,873 --> 00:28:51,239
<i>Definitely did scare me.</i>

534
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:55,178
<i>Even in Africa, fewer
GMOs is being fueled</i>

535
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:59,917
<i>by a discredited study
on tumor prone rats.</i>

536
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,518
<i>Here's a picture of
some of these rats.</i>

537
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,285
<i>So, Jeffery, why... you know,</i>

538
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:05,823
<i>how can it be this
information is being ignored?</i>

539
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:08,890
<i>They've got bad science
down to a science.</i>

540
00:29:08,892 --> 00:29:10,994
How many people have seen
the pictures of the rats?

541
00:29:10,996 --> 00:29:13,829
That's not enough. You've
got to see these tumors.

542
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:16,365
<i>A study by Gilles-Eric Séralini</i>

543
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:17,834
<i>showing rats fed GMOs...</i>

544
00:29:17,836 --> 00:29:19,736
<i>This had enormous effects on people.</i>

545
00:29:19,738 --> 00:29:21,004
This one image was really responsible

546
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:23,206
for the GM import ban here in Kenya.

547
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:26,240
Making reference to the Séralini report.

548
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:28,579
The Séralini... infamous Séralini study.

549
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:31,813
So this is a study where a scientist says,

550
00:29:31,815 --> 00:29:34,618
<i>"I have rats that have cancer."</i>

551
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,485
<i>Yeah, he had a press
conference, but he demanded</i>

552
00:29:36,487 --> 00:29:40,290
<i>that no scientists be there
to question his results.</i>

553
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:43,426
<i>If you look closely at
the study, Séralini</i>

554
00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:44,829
<i>used a strain of rats</i>

555
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:46,829
<i>that are prone to develop tumors</i>

556
00:29:46,831 --> 00:29:48,797
<i>no matter what they eat.</i>

557
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,101
<i>The conclusions that were drawn</i>

558
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:55,738
<i>could not be warranted from
the data that was obtained.</i>

559
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,540
<i>From everything I've read,</i>

560
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,774
<i>there are serious issues
with the Séralini study.</i>

561
00:29:59,776 --> 00:30:03,245
I've talked to people I respect
who look at the science and say,

562
00:30:03,247 --> 00:30:05,815
<i>"Statistically this... this
actually doesn't hold up."</i>

563
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:07,883
<i>And the paper was retracted.</i>

564
00:30:07,885 --> 00:30:10,119
<i>Every scientist around the world</i>

565
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:13,156
<i>who looked at it said
the data was inadequate.</i>

566
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:16,759
<i>Even though Séralini's
paper was retracted,</i>

567
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:18,896
<i>the effect of publishing</i>

568
00:30:18,898 --> 00:30:23,533
<i>that original paper still lingers</i>

569
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:25,467
<i>and lingers and lingers.</i>

570
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:29,439
<i>And it's gonna take a
long time to go away.</i>

571
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:39,381
<i>It's much easier to sell
fear than it is science.</i>

572
00:30:39,383 --> 00:30:41,217
<i>And I think we need
to talk about science</i>

573
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:43,718
<i>and discuss these
things in the open.</i>

574
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,421
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Allison.

575
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:47,790
I'm a professor at University
of California in Davis.

576
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:49,557
- Oh.
- Oh, good.

577
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,995
Don't you think putting all
these chemicals in our food

578
00:30:51,997 --> 00:30:53,996
and our animals isn't dangerous?

579
00:30:53,998 --> 00:30:56,932
Well, I think that... I mean,
if... this particular sign,

580
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:59,901
I think, is referring to
the Séralini rat study,

581
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:01,604
I'm guessing.

582
00:31:01,606 --> 00:31:03,607
And it's been retracted from
the scientific literature.

583
00:31:03,609 --> 00:31:07,343
This topic of GMOs is a bit
like playing Whack-a-Mole.

584
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:10,044
And so there's all these
different issues that pop up.

585
00:31:10,046 --> 00:31:13,216
That over 250,000 Indian farmers,

586
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:16,151
in the last ten years or
so, have committed suicides.

587
00:31:16,153 --> 00:31:18,121
<i>And one of the issues
that pops up quite a lot</i>

588
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:20,689
<i>is the farmer suicides in India.</i>

589
00:31:20,691 --> 00:31:22,992
So the... the farmer suicides...
I mean, I know I've looked

590
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:24,428
at the scientific literature on that.

591
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,496
And there are... there are reports

592
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:29,233
that show that there has been
no increase in farmer suicides.

593
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:31,566
When you actually look
at the data around that,

594
00:31:31,568 --> 00:31:32,901
the rate of suicide

595
00:31:32,903 --> 00:31:35,071
before the introduction of GM crops

596
00:31:35,073 --> 00:31:36,706
and after hasn't changed.

597
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:39,876
It's a matter of debt, and
it's not actually associated

598
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:41,411
with the use of GM technology.

599
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:45,615
It's really confusing
causation and correlation.

600
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:46,917
Well, I just... I was wondering

601
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:49,151
if there's any application of GMOs

602
00:31:49,153 --> 00:31:51,155
that you would be supportive of.

603
00:31:51,157 --> 00:31:53,488
So for example, if...
if a developing country

604
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,992
developed its own insect-resistant,

605
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:59,461
or... or disease-resistant
cassava, for example.

606
00:31:59,463 --> 00:32:01,998
Developed by the
researchers in that country,

607
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,833
not associated with
Monsanto or any company,

608
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:07,571
and gave that to the people to use,

609
00:32:07,573 --> 00:32:08,938
would you... would you be

610
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,540
supportive of that, conceptually?

611
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:12,474
I definitely... I definitely
will look at all that,

612
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:14,878
and I appreciate your...
your feedback on this.

613
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,344
Well, and... and I'm happy to talk to you.

614
00:32:16,346 --> 00:32:18,147
And I guess, what frustrates me is,

615
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:20,216
I think this technology has potential,

616
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:23,352
and yet it gets kind of mixed
up with a lot of other concerns

617
00:32:23,354 --> 00:32:25,656
about multinational control.

618
00:32:25,658 --> 00:32:27,288
Maybe it's not an "and/or."

619
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,091
I agree. Can we agree on that?

620
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:30,459
All right. Okay. Here's my card.

621
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:32,093
It was nice talking with you ladies.

622
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:33,262
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

623
00:32:33,264 --> 00:32:34,663
- Okay.
- Thanks, Allison.

624
00:32:34,665 --> 00:32:36,300
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

625
00:32:36,302 --> 00:32:38,167
<i>I wish that we could
have a discussion</i>

626
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:39,968
<i>about what it really is
that concerns people,</i>

627
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:44,739
rather than trying to scare
the bejesus out of people.

628
00:32:44,741 --> 00:32:46,442
<i>The protests are spreading.</i>

629
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:48,544
<i>I hate the British government.
I hate the American government.</i>

630
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:50,646
<i>This is about money.
This is about power.</i>

631
00:32:50,648 --> 00:32:53,617
- <i>Corporate greed.</i>
- <i>Corruption. Money in politics.</i>

632
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:58,354
<i>All they create is
money for themselves.</i>

633
00:32:58,356 --> 00:33:02,026
<i>From oil companies
denying climate change...</i>

634
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:08,465
<i>tobacco scientists saying
cigarettes are safe,</i>

635
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:12,034
<i>to the pharmaceutical industry
sometimes overcharging us</i>

636
00:33:12,036 --> 00:33:14,269
<i>for drugs we don't need,</i>

637
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:19,208
<i>corporate greed and bias have
broken the public's trust.</i>

638
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,713
People won't take what
scientists say on trust,

639
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:25,349
<i>what governments say on trust.</i>

640
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:27,716
We all think that there's some
kind of corporate influence;

641
00:33:27,718 --> 00:33:31,720
that the Monsantos are the ones
who are really running the show.

642
00:33:31,722 --> 00:33:33,389
And there's good reasons

643
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:36,293
why people don't trust
corporations to run things.

<i>Monsanto is one of the most
hated companies in the world.</i>

654
00:34:01,651 --> 00:34:03,320
<i>How did that happen?</i>

655
00:34:03,322 --> 00:34:05,621
<i>In their early history
as a chemical company,</i>

656
00:34:05,623 --> 00:34:07,457
<i>they manufactured several products</i>

657
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:09,826
<i>that turned out to
have unintended health</i>

658
00:34:09,828 --> 00:34:11,594
<i>and environmental consequences.</i>

659
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:14,730
<i>To combat malaria-transmitting
mosquitoes during World War II,</i>

660
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:18,167
<i>Monsanto and other
companies manufactured DDT,</i>

661
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:21,871
<i>which helped save millions of lives.</i>

662
00:34:21,873 --> 00:34:25,308
<i>But as environmental
author Rachel Carson</i>

663
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,844
<i>pointed out in her landmark
book</i> Silent Spring,

664
00:34:28,846 --> 00:34:30,779
<i>there were hidden
dangers with the toxicity</i>

665
00:34:30,781 --> 00:34:33,815
<i>and overuse of DDT
and other chemicals.</i>

666
00:34:33,817 --> 00:34:37,154
<i>Monsanto was also
one of nine companies</i>

667
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:38,987
<i>commissioned by the U.S. Military</i>

668
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:40,690
<i>to make Agent Orange</i>

669
00:34:40,692 --> 00:34:43,493
<i>to help clear away the jungle
during the Vietnam War.</i>

670
00:34:43,495 --> 00:34:46,395
<i>But it contaminated soil and water</i>

671
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:49,766
<i>and was linked to a
variety of birth defects.</i>

672
00:34:51,234 --> 00:34:52,868
<i>With the public rightly questioning</i>

673
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,737
<i>the overuse of toxic
chemicals in farming,</i>

674
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,841
<i>Monsanto looked towards
a new technology,</i>

675
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:00,243
<i>genetic engineering,</i>

676
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:02,411
<i>to help farmers in
the timeless struggle</i>

677
00:35:02,413 --> 00:35:04,346
<i>against weeds and insects.</i>

678
00:35:04,348 --> 00:35:06,315
<i>And to help recoup the
billions of dollars</i>

679
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:08,150
<i>spent developing this technology,</i>

680
00:35:08,152 --> 00:35:11,286
<i>Monsanto focused on commodity crops,</i>

681
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:14,757
<i>patenting seeds for
corn, soy, and cotton.</i>

682
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:17,092
<i>While they helped
invent the technology,</i>

683
00:35:17,094 --> 00:35:18,661
<i>they didn't invent patents.</i>

684
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:20,830
<i>Almost every agricultural advance,</i>

685
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:24,199
<i>in both conventional
and organic farming,</i>

686
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:27,337
<i>has a patent behind it.</i>

687
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:30,239
<i>The first GMO Monsanto
introduced was</i>

688
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:32,708
<i>to help farmers protect
their crops from insects</i>

689
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:37,313
<i>by using the naturally occurring
insecticide known as Bt.</i>

690
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:40,149
<i>Bt,</i> Bacillus thuringiensis,

691
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:42,920
is a bacterial disease of caterpillars.

692
00:35:42,922 --> 00:35:44,587
<i>Organic farmers use that.</i>

693
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:46,455
<i>We use that.</i>

694
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:49,891
<i>By Monsanto engineering
the Bt into the seed,</i>

695
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:53,964
<i>the need for spraying
was greatly reduced.</i>

696
00:35:53,966 --> 00:35:57,866
<i>Bt crops have reduced
insecticide use</i>

697
00:35:57,868 --> 00:35:59,469
<i>tenfold in the United States</i>

698
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:02,639
<i>and have had huge impact
in developing countries.</i>

699
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:07,409
<i>The other GMO Monsanto introduced</i>

700
00:36:07,411 --> 00:36:09,176
<i>helped farmers control weeds</i>

701
00:36:09,178 --> 00:36:12,248
<i>by providing seeds tolerant
to their herbicide glyphosate,</i>

702
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,882
<i>also known as Roundup.</i>

703
00:36:13,884 --> 00:36:17,453
<i>These seeds became known
as "Roundup Ready" seeds.</i>

704
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:19,120
<i>They could be sprayed with Roundup,</i>

705
00:36:19,122 --> 00:36:20,823
<i>which would kill the weeds,</i>

706
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:23,125
<i>but not harm the crops.</i>

707
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:27,163
Let me tell you how overjoyed we were

708
00:36:27,165 --> 00:36:30,065
when Roundup Ready seeds became available.

709
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:33,270
It was a gift from God.

710
00:36:33,272 --> 00:36:35,473
I mean, it was that big a deal.

711
00:36:49,654 --> 00:36:53,721
<i>Both Bt and Roundup Ready
GMOs became huge successes,</i>

712
00:36:53,723 --> 00:36:57,759
<i>and are currently being used
by over 90% of corn, soy,</i>

713
00:36:57,761 --> 00:37:00,297
<i>and cotton farmers
in the United States</i>

714
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:01,830
<i>and around the world.</i>

715
00:37:01,832 --> 00:37:04,665
<i>And with this success, Monsanto made</i>

716
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:08,571
<i>and continues to make,
billions of dollars.</i>

717
00:37:08,573 --> 00:37:11,040
<i>They came up with a trick,
and so now you can spray</i>

718
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:13,243
<i>as much herbicide
as you want on them.</i>

719
00:37:13,245 --> 00:37:15,643
Good for the company, they sell the seeds,

720
00:37:15,645 --> 00:37:17,547
and they sell the herbicide.

721
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:22,018
These war criminals who
became poison criminals

722
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,953
and are now GMO criminals.

723
00:37:25,723 --> 00:37:28,558
<i>This brings us to one of the
major questions in this debate.</i>

724
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,826
<i>Have GMO technologies like Bt</i>

725
00:37:30,828 --> 00:37:33,996
<i>and Roundup Ready
increased or decreased</i>

726
00:37:33,998 --> 00:37:36,498
<i>the use of harmful pesticides?</i>

727
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,303
<i>Agricultural economist
Charles Benbrook</i>

728
00:37:39,305 --> 00:37:40,636
<i>authored a landmark study</i>

729
00:37:40,638 --> 00:37:42,304
<i>on the subject of GMO crops</i>

730
00:37:42,306 --> 00:37:44,208
<i>and pesticide use.</i>

731
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,576
This technology led farmers down a path

732
00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:51,380
<i>that now requires more pesticides,</i>

733
00:37:51,382 --> 00:37:54,949
<i>by far, than what they did in 1996</i>

734
00:37:54,951 --> 00:37:58,221
when the technology was first adopted.

735
00:37:58,223 --> 00:38:00,288
<i>There's a lot of discussion about</i>

736
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,991
whether the amount of herbicides

737
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:04,893
or pesticides have increased
with the advent of GM crops.

738
00:38:04,895 --> 00:38:08,397
Some of the people... Dr. Benbrook would be

739
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:09,632
one example... would say,

740
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:12,234
"Well, pesticide use has gone up."

741
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:13,670
And then he gives you

742
00:38:13,672 --> 00:38:15,670
their statistics for the use of Roundup.

743
00:38:15,672 --> 00:38:18,609
The amount of pesticides
is sort of beside the point.

744
00:38:18,611 --> 00:38:20,576
<i>The question is, "Are
they more harmful?</i>

745
00:38:20,578 --> 00:38:22,044
<i>Are they more dangerous?"</i>

746
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:23,813
<i>They have to point
out that glyphosate,</i>

747
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:25,348
<i>of course, has very,
very low toxicity.</i>

748
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,082
<i>Lower than caffeine or salt.</i>

749
00:38:27,084 --> 00:38:30,553
<i>Ironically, because of the
more harmful herbicides</i>

750
00:38:30,555 --> 00:38:32,054
<i>glyphosate replaced,</i>

751
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:36,991
<i>pounds up doesn't equal toxicity up.</i>

752
00:38:36,993 --> 00:38:41,129
I often tell people, the
people fierce in attacking GE,

753
00:38:41,131 --> 00:38:42,531
I say, "You know if you won

754
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:45,402
and you succeed in banning this technology,

755
00:38:45,404 --> 00:38:48,370
let's say you... you got your dream.

756
00:38:48,372 --> 00:38:49,638
Where would we be?"

757
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,107
Well, we would be back to 1996.

758
00:38:52,109 --> 00:38:55,310
<i>This was not a golden age
in American agriculture.</i>

759
00:38:55,312 --> 00:38:56,879
<i>The weeds are still gonna grow.</i>

760
00:38:56,881 --> 00:38:58,980
<i>So you've got to do
something about the weeds.</i>

761
00:38:58,982 --> 00:39:02,118
<i>We'd probably go back
to the more toxic ones</i>

762
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,685
<i>that were being used prior</i>

763
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:07,556
<i>to the introduction of
Roundup Ready crops.</i>

764
00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:09,025
<i>And if you look to the details,</i>

765
00:39:09,027 --> 00:39:11,792
<i>past page one of Benbrook's study,</i>

766
00:39:11,794 --> 00:39:14,596
<i>even he acknowledges more
benefits than dangers</i>

767
00:39:14,598 --> 00:39:16,899
<i>from these technologies.</i>

768
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:19,669
<i>In light of its generally
favorable environmental</i>

769
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:21,303
<i>and toxicological properties,</i>

770
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:23,940
<i>especially compared to
some of the herbicides</i>

771
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:25,442
<i>displaced by glyphosate,</i>

772
00:39:25,444 --> 00:39:27,442
<i>the dramatic increase
in glyphosate use</i>

773
00:39:27,444 --> 00:39:31,380
<i>has likely not markedly
increased human health risks.</i>

774
00:39:31,382 --> 00:39:33,614
<i>So when all the data are considered,</i>

775
00:39:33,616 --> 00:39:36,719
<i>GMO technologies like
Bt and Roundup Ready</i>

776
00:39:36,721 --> 00:39:39,955
<i>have decreased the use
of harmful pesticides.</i>

777
00:39:39,957 --> 00:39:45,027
<i>Simply put, their net impact
is better for the environment.</i>

778
00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:48,130
It's very difficult to
pay Monsanto a compliment.

779
00:39:48,132 --> 00:39:49,263
It's like praising witchcraft.

780
00:39:49,265 --> 00:39:50,799
People can't imagine

781
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:52,569
that that company could ever do anything

782
00:39:52,571 --> 00:39:53,837
which would benefit the environment,

783
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,207
but that's what's happened.

784
00:39:57,209 --> 00:39:59,674
<i>A Dr. Oz Alert.</i>

785
00:39:59,676 --> 00:40:02,312
<i>The new GMO pesticide arms race</i>

786
00:40:02,314 --> 00:40:04,313
<i>doctors are warning against.</i>

787
00:40:04,315 --> 00:40:05,880
<i>I'm very concerned that... that</i>

788
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:08,484
<i>I'm at the beginning
of a catastrophe.</i>

789
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:10,551
<i>So safety has to be sacrificed</i>

790
00:40:10,553 --> 00:40:12,788
<i>in order to maximize profits.</i>

791
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:16,290
<i>But most of the public,
expecting to hate anything</i>

792
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:17,792
<i>coming from Monsanto,</i>

793
00:40:17,794 --> 00:40:19,562
<i>championed Benbrook's study</i>

794
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:21,696
<i>as peer-reviewed,
scientific evidence</i>

795
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:24,031
<i>that GMOs cause harm.</i>

796
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:27,002
And it was that perceived
umbilical connection

797
00:40:27,004 --> 00:40:28,103
between the... the GMO

798
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:30,073
and the chemical, and the pesticide,

799
00:40:30,075 --> 00:40:32,408
which, I think, has
stuck in people's heads.

800
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,942
Hell no, GMO.

801
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:36,879
<i>While there are many
bundled concerns</i>

802
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:38,948
<i>about Monsanto as a company,</i>

803
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,549
<i>to be concerned about the safety</i>

804
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:44,018
<i>of their GMOs is to be misinformed.</i>

805
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:54,661
Yes. Let's go ahead and sit

806
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:56,431
so we can get good seats.

807
00:40:56,433 --> 00:40:57,966
<i>The world that you live in</i>

808
00:40:57,968 --> 00:40:59,669
<i>when you're a young
environmental activist</i>

809
00:40:59,671 --> 00:41:01,536
<i>is a very black and white world.</i>

810
00:41:01,538 --> 00:41:03,038
<i>You know, there's the
bad guys out there,</i>

811
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,841
<i>and the bad guys are
the corporations.</i>

812
00:41:04,843 --> 00:41:07,375
<i>They're the police.
They're the state.</i>

813
00:41:07,377 --> 00:41:08,712
And there was no compromise.

814
00:41:08,714 --> 00:41:10,612
You didn't talk to the corporations.

815
00:41:10,614 --> 00:41:12,647
You stood your ground,
and you battled them.

816
00:41:12,649 --> 00:41:15,585
Biotechnology is gonna
continue to be important.

817
00:41:15,587 --> 00:41:17,252
I would be the first to tell you,

818
00:41:17,254 --> 00:41:20,723
as... as, really the guy who
helped start the... the GMOs

819
00:41:20,725 --> 00:41:23,658
and the biotechnology,
that it's an important tool.

820
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,196
It's not the only tool that will be key.

821
00:41:26,198 --> 00:41:27,663
<i>And as we launched
these technologies,</i>

822
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:29,563
<i>farmers around the world</i>

823
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:32,734
were excited about the benefits
that these products provided.

824
00:41:32,736 --> 00:41:37,806
<i>Clearly, you know, looking
back, we should have also been</i>

825
00:41:37,808 --> 00:41:40,975
much more transparent
in enriching the public.

826
00:41:40,977 --> 00:41:43,179
<i>And you know that... you
know, as I look back,</i>

827
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:45,781
<i>I... I wish that was something
that we would have done earlier.</i>

828
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:48,049
<i>And now we know that
that was a mistake.</i>

829
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:52,221
<i>And in the meantime, I think
that that void of information</i>

830
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:53,723
got filled by... by folks

831
00:41:53,725 --> 00:41:56,424
who... who really don't
understand the technology

832
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:58,092
and had a very different message.

833
00:41:58,094 --> 00:42:00,562
Good. You had a question over here. Yes.

834
00:42:00,564 --> 00:42:02,665
Well, I wonder what Monsanto's doing now

835
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:03,866
that Roundup has been found

836
00:42:03,868 --> 00:42:06,335
to be linked to birth defects,

837
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:08,103
fatal kidney disease epidemics,

838
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:11,007
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, brain cancer.

839
00:42:11,009 --> 00:42:13,475
How are you trying to
remedy this toxic landscape

840
00:42:13,477 --> 00:42:15,011
that you've created? Thank you.

841
00:42:15,013 --> 00:42:17,312
Okay. Thank you for your question.

842
00:42:17,314 --> 00:42:20,250
None of the studies that
you quoted are accurate.

843
00:42:20,252 --> 00:42:22,585
They're all pseudoscience, and I'd be happy

844
00:42:22,587 --> 00:42:24,486
later to take you through each one

845
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:28,857
and explain to you the policies
and the... the misinformation.

846
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:32,328
They are not recognized by
any governing body or agency

847
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,895
as being valid studies.

848
00:42:33,897 --> 00:42:35,996
And so the importance of
the conversation is this.

849
00:42:35,998 --> 00:42:39,667
Everybody is entitled to their opinions

850
00:42:39,669 --> 00:42:41,101
and to their emotions,

851
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:42,371
but in the end,

852
00:42:42,373 --> 00:42:44,908
we have to be grounded in the real science.

853
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,375
Otherwise, we will be...

854
00:42:46,377 --> 00:42:48,511
we will be aimless in our decision making.

855
00:42:48,513 --> 00:42:50,413
And... and that's true whether

856
00:42:50,415 --> 00:42:52,013
we're talking about vaccines,

857
00:42:52,015 --> 00:42:54,016
whether we're talking about climate change,

858
00:42:54,018 --> 00:42:55,784
or whether we're talking about GMOs.

859
00:42:55,786 --> 00:42:57,118
So I just urge you to... to think

860
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,957
through to... to the real science.

861
00:43:00,959 --> 00:43:04,460
Do you and your family eat the
crops grown by your company?

862
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:05,929
- Absolutely.
- Good. Okay.

863
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:07,395
- Yep.
- All right. Thanks.

864
00:43:07,397 --> 00:43:09,198
All right. Thanks.

865
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:31,752
<i>I think trashing crops
is effective in the sense</i>

866
00:43:31,754 --> 00:43:34,923
<i>that it sends a huge
message to everybody.</i>

867
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,828
<i>Angry farmers destroyed

868
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:44,366

870
00:43:47,837 --> 00:43:49,538
<i>Some people would call it vandalism.</i>

871
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,140
<i>We call it decontamination,</i>

872
00:43:51,142 --> 00:43:53,975

<i>spreading across the countryside.</i>

874
00:43:55,879 --> 00:43:58,245
<i>Our intentions were honorable.</i>

875
00:43:58,247 --> 00:44:00,016
What we were trying to do was to build

876
00:44:00,018 --> 00:44:02,150
a more sustainable farming system.

877
00:44:02,152 --> 00:44:04,987
We were trying to eliminate
chemicals from our food supply.

878
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:07,989
We were trying to protect
the future of the planet

879
00:44:07,991 --> 00:44:09,857
and the health of our children.

880
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:12,027
<i>As an activist, you tend
to take these things</i>

881
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:14,462
<i>as a point of faith, so
it begs the question,</i>

882
00:44:14,464 --> 00:44:17,833
<i>"How do you know that
GMOs are the enemy?"</i>

883
00:44:17,835 --> 00:44:19,567
What if we got it wrong?

884
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:23,839
What if eliminating GMOs was not
the way to achieve these ends.

885
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:26,208
<i>Now, my lords,
ladies, and gentlemen.</i>

886
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:28,210
Here and up front, I want to apologize

887
00:44:28,212 --> 00:44:30,879
for having spent several
years ripping up GM crops.

888
00:44:30,881 --> 00:44:34,384
And, that I thereby assisted in demonizing

889
00:44:34,386 --> 00:44:36,183
an important technological option which can

890
00:44:36,185 --> 00:44:39,022
and should be used to
benefit the environment.

891
00:44:39,024 --> 00:44:41,056
As an environmentalist,

892
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:42,690
I could not have chosen a
more counterproductive path,

893
00:44:42,692 --> 00:44:44,226
and I now regret it completely.

894
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:47,728
So what happened between 1995 and now

895
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:49,498
that made me not only change my mind,

896
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,734
but actually come here and stand
before you today and admit it?

897
00:44:53,736 --> 00:44:55,938
Well, the answer is fairly simple.

898
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,272
I discovered science, and in the process,

899
00:44:58,274 --> 00:45:01,944
I hope, I am becoming a
better environmentalist.

900
00:45:01,946 --> 00:45:05,245
Before I changed my mind on
GMOs, I had spent ten years

901
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:07,750
developing a career as a science writer,

902
00:45:07,752 --> 00:45:09,449
mostly on the issue of climate change.

903
00:45:09,451 --> 00:45:12,321
Every book, every article,
everything I wrote,

904
00:45:12,323 --> 00:45:16,424
I wanted to have peer-reviewed
scientific references.

905
00:45:16,426 --> 00:45:17,794
So I knew that that was based

906
00:45:17,796 --> 00:45:19,594
on the best scientific data available.

907
00:45:19,596 --> 00:45:20,962
Whereas, on the GMO issue,

908
00:45:20,964 --> 00:45:22,330
I was taking the opposite perspective.

909
00:45:22,332 --> 00:45:24,134
I was arguing against the scientists

910
00:45:24,136 --> 00:45:26,170
without any scientific data.

911
00:45:29,207 --> 00:45:33,842
He says he's junked ideology
in favor of hard science.

912
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:36,511
Is it really as simple as that?

913
00:45:36,513 --> 00:45:37,812
You know, your intellect,

914
00:45:37,814 --> 00:45:39,281
presumably, hasn't changed very much,

915
00:45:39,283 --> 00:45:41,484
and if you were so wrong, so incompetent,

916
00:45:41,486 --> 00:45:43,451
so shallow in the past,

917
00:45:43,453 --> 00:45:45,989
why would... should we believe
you're any different now?

918
00:45:45,991 --> 00:45:48,089
Well, all the more reason for
me to change my mind in response

919
00:45:48,091 --> 00:45:49,891
to changing facts as I saw it.

920
00:45:49,893 --> 00:45:52,161
Science should be about
changing your conclusion

921
00:45:52,163 --> 00:45:54,761
on the basis of objective evidence,

922
00:45:54,763 --> 00:45:56,332
but understanding that is tough.

923
00:45:56,334 --> 00:45:58,333
You know, that's not how we
humans are wired to think.

924
00:45:58,335 --> 00:46:00,034
You know, we're wired to make
our minds up and that's it,

925
00:46:00,036 --> 00:46:01,603
then we've made a decision.

926
00:46:01,605 --> 00:46:05,707
And... and that's gonna be,
largely emotionally based.

927
00:46:05,709 --> 00:46:07,875
But so thinking like a... learning

928
00:46:07,877 --> 00:46:09,212
to think like a scientist

929
00:46:09,214 --> 00:46:11,612
and learning to take positions

930
00:46:11,614 --> 00:46:13,049
which are amenable to change

931
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:15,516
was the most difficult thing for me to do,

932
00:46:15,518 --> 00:46:17,486
as an environmentalist.

933
00:46:23,361 --> 00:46:25,194
<i>When it comes to complex issues</i>

934
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:26,962
<i>that affect food and farming,</i>

935
00:46:26,964 --> 00:46:30,232
<i>everyone struggles to
make the right decisions.</i>

936
00:46:30,234 --> 00:46:32,134
<i>For some, their decisions come</i>

937
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:36,404
<i>from a scientific assessment
of risks and benefits.</i>

938
00:46:38,642 --> 00:46:42,377
<i>I wanted to be an organic
farmer because, number one,</i>

939
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:44,679
the produce is much more profitable,

940
00:46:44,681 --> 00:46:48,317
<i>and number two, it's
much more sustainable.</i>

941
00:46:52,857 --> 00:46:55,223
I'm proud to be an organic farmer.

942
00:46:55,225 --> 00:46:58,393
<i>Instead of using
chemical pesticides,</i>

943
00:46:58,395 --> 00:47:03,031
<i>organic agriculture uses
integrated controls.</i>

944
00:47:03,033 --> 00:47:05,065
<i>Organic farming was
developed around the world</i>

945
00:47:05,067 --> 00:47:06,534
<i>for many reasons:</i>

946
00:47:06,536 --> 00:47:09,170
<i>to curb the use of
synthetic chemicals,</i>

947
00:47:09,172 --> 00:47:11,371
<i>help soil fertility,</i>

948
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:14,743
<i>and, ideally, improve the
overall sustainability</i>

949
00:47:14,745 --> 00:47:16,277
<i>of our food production.</i>

950
00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:20,083
<i>Although organic
agriculture is a good model,</i>

951
00:47:20,085 --> 00:47:22,417
there are aspects that prevent it

952
00:47:22,419 --> 00:47:26,656
from becoming the sustainable agriculture.

953
00:47:26,658 --> 00:47:28,989
The challenging part for organic

954
00:47:28,991 --> 00:47:33,629
<i>is to provide food on
a very large scale.</i>

955
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,663
<i>It's very difficult to do.</i>

956
00:47:35,665 --> 00:47:39,000
Organic farming has taught
all of us about so much

957
00:47:39,002 --> 00:47:40,703
over the last... over recent decades,

958
00:47:40,705 --> 00:47:43,306
<i>but if this is an organic
planet we're going towards,</i>

959
00:47:43,308 --> 00:47:45,239
you would see all the
rainforests destroyed.

960
00:47:45,241 --> 00:47:47,143
We'd have to double or even triple

961
00:47:47,145 --> 00:47:48,511
the amount of land area
which has been cultivated

962
00:47:48,513 --> 00:47:50,143
just to feed the current population,

963
00:47:50,145 --> 00:47:52,181
let alone a population of 9 1/2 billion.

964
00:47:52,183 --> 00:47:54,516
So it would be an ecological disaster.

965
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:57,719
<i>And so we need to use
every kind of technology</i>

966
00:47:57,721 --> 00:48:01,955
<i>and strategy related to
agriculture that we can.</i>

967
00:48:01,957 --> 00:48:04,326
<i>And genetically engineered crops</i>

968
00:48:04,328 --> 00:48:07,395
have achieved some of those goals.

969
00:48:07,397 --> 00:48:11,165
<i>So the papaya ringspot
virus in Hawaii.</i>

970
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:15,203
<i>Organic practices just
weren't gonna control that.</i>

971
00:48:15,205 --> 00:48:17,906
<i>Whether it's small farmers in Africa</i>

972
00:48:17,908 --> 00:48:19,808
<i>or it's large farmers in the U.S.,</i>

973
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:25,180
we need strategies to
solve both their problems.

974
00:48:30,154 --> 00:48:33,587
Zen Honeycutt from Moms Across America.

975
00:48:34,892 --> 00:48:37,326
I met the CEO of Monsanto, and I said,

976
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:40,929
"We have science that your
products harm our children.

977
00:48:40,931 --> 00:48:42,665
<i>"And just consider, if you're wrong,</i>

978
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:46,167
<i>"the repercussions to
your company are enormous</i>

979
00:48:46,169 --> 00:48:48,404
and the repercussions
to the world are huge."

980
00:48:48,406 --> 00:48:50,270
And he said, "Well, if you're wrong,

981
00:48:50,272 --> 00:48:52,674
you're scaring an awful lot of people."

982
00:48:52,676 --> 00:48:54,442
And I said, "If I were wrong,

983
00:48:54,444 --> 00:48:58,047
and I'm not, then the only repercussion

984
00:48:58,049 --> 00:49:00,583
to the people is that
they're eating organic."

985
00:49:00,585 --> 00:49:03,317
And there is nothing
wrong with organic food.

986
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:05,219
It is perfect the way it is.

987
00:49:05,221 --> 00:49:07,221
Yeah!

988
00:49:07,223 --> 00:49:10,958
Zen Honeycutt scares moms into believing

989
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,659
that they're harming their children

990
00:49:12,661 --> 00:49:15,196
by feeding them GMOs.

991
00:49:15,198 --> 00:49:17,033
<i>We're gonna go and see</i>

992
00:49:17,035 --> 00:49:18,399
<i>if we can have a little
conversation with Zen.</i>

993
00:49:18,401 --> 00:49:19,933
We think maybe it'd be a good idea

994
00:49:19,935 --> 00:49:21,270
to talk to her in person.

995
00:49:21,272 --> 00:49:23,170
You know, let her know that we're human,

996
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:24,806
and let her know that we
know that she's human too.

997
00:49:24,808 --> 00:49:28,176
And, you know, maybe it
might improve dialogue.

998
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:33,116
Okay?

999
00:49:49,399 --> 00:49:52,102
It's not... it's not harmful.

1000
00:49:58,274 --> 00:49:59,608
Zero.

1001
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:14,288
A concerned mom named Zen Honeycutt

1002
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:15,891
started Moms Across America.

1003
00:50:15,893 --> 00:50:18,525
So when did you first become
concerned that your kids

1004
00:50:18,527 --> 00:50:21,062
were being affected by these pesticides?

1005
00:50:21,064 --> 00:50:22,765
Well, Dr. Oz, for a long time,

1006
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:25,833
I didn't know that pesticides
might be affecting my children.

1007
00:50:25,835 --> 00:50:29,370
In fact, they had rashes and
severe allergies for years.

1008
00:50:29,372 --> 00:50:31,339
So what tests did doctors do to identify

1009
00:50:31,341 --> 00:50:33,107
that there were pesticides
were involved with this process?

1010
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:34,509
Well, my doctors told me

1011
00:50:34,511 --> 00:50:36,344
that they would not test for glyphosate

1012
00:50:36,346 --> 00:50:38,147
because there was no reason to.

1013
00:50:38,149 --> 00:50:40,815
But we finally found a
private lab that would,

1014
00:50:40,817 --> 00:50:44,686
and we had shockingly unacceptable results.

1015
00:50:52,796 --> 00:50:56,663
<i>With no scientific oversight,

1016
00:50:56,665 --> 00:50:59,299
<i>using random urine and
breast milk samples</i>

1017
00:50:59,301 --> 00:51:01,536
<i>sent in from website followers,</i>

1018
00:51:01,538 --> 00:51:04,571
<i>Moms Across America

1019
00:51:04,573 --> 00:51:07,076
<i>Not in a peer-reviewed
scientific journal,</i>

1020
00:51:07,078 --> 00:51:09,342
<i>but on their own website.</i>

1021

<i>A biologist trained in analyzing
breast milk was attacked online</i>

1022
00:51:14,384 --> 00:51:18,254
<i>when she tried to point out

1023
00:51:18,256 --> 00:51:20,989
<i>I'm a human milk and
lactation nutritionist.</i>

1024
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:22,658
<i>I was looking at milk composition.</i>

00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,292
<i>What I think that they don't realize</i>

1026
00:51:24,294 --> 00:51:27,328
<i>is, I did not have
a dog in the fight.</i>

1027
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,130
<i>The worst ones for me, being a mom,</i>

<i>somehow I could be bought
off when I'm killing babies.</i>

1030
00:51:34,906 --> 00:51:37,272
<i>You know. And how
can I sleep at night.</i>

1031
00:51:37,274 --> 00:51:39,373
<i>And that I have blood on my hands.</i>

1032
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,544
<i>You're not kidding?</i>

1033
00:51:43,781 --> 00:51:45,513
<i>I think that there

00:51:45,515 --> 00:51:47,147

00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:48,984
<i>it's just that, from what I see now,</i>

1036
00:51:48,986 --> 00:51:51,420
<i>there's so much propaganda

1037
00:51:51,422 --> 00:51:53,587
<i>what's... what's
real and what isn't.</i>

1038
00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:56,091
What... what do you think
drives Zen Honeycutt?

1039
00:51:56,093 --> 00:51:58,658
Or what's her motivation?

1040
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,397
<i>I... honestly, I think her
motivation is the same as ours.</i>

1041
00:52:02,399 --> 00:52:05,701
<i>I... I really think
she honestly thinks</i>

1042
00:52:05,703 --> 00:52:08,804
<i>what she's doing is
gonna save children,</i>

1043
00:52:08,806 --> 00:52:11,906
<i>but it is so not based in reality</i>

1044
00:52:11,908 --> 00:52:13,708
<i>that it's not... you know,</i>

1045
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:16,676
<i>if anything, I think
she's doing a lot of harm.</i>

1046
00:52:16,678 --> 00:52:19,813
<i>So what happens a lot in
this particular discussion.</i>

1047
00:52:19,815 --> 00:52:23,284
<i>Groups that are opposed to
this technology kind of suggest</i>

1048
00:52:23,286 --> 00:52:26,554
<i>that this... GMOs cause cancer.</i>

1049
00:52:26,556 --> 00:52:28,723
<i>And, as a mother, it
just broke my heart.</i>

1050
00:52:28,725 --> 00:52:33,529
<i>That parent, now, is
wondering what they did wrong.</i>

1051
00:52:33,531 --> 00:52:36,464
<i>You know, every parent, you
know, wants to blame themselves</i>

1052
00:52:36,466 --> 00:52:38,567
when something tragic
happens to their child.

1053
00:52:38,569 --> 00:52:40,837
And I think I can speak to that,

1054
00:52:40,839 --> 00:52:42,770
because I actually, myself,

1055
00:52:42,772 --> 00:52:45,341
had a stillborn child, my daughter.

1056
00:52:45,343 --> 00:52:48,842
When you're faced with
that kind of tragedy,

1057
00:52:48,844 --> 00:52:50,580
it's... it's very easy

1058
00:52:50,582 --> 00:52:54,216
to want to blame something for causing it.

1059
00:52:54,218 --> 00:52:55,850
You look at, you know, everything you ate,

1060
00:52:55,852 --> 00:52:57,652
and everything you did,
and what... "But how could I

1061
00:52:57,654 --> 00:52:59,487
have stopped that tragedy from happening?"

1062
00:52:59,489 --> 00:53:02,891
But, you know, as... as
time has gone through,

1063
00:53:02,893 --> 00:53:04,759
I've realized that, you know... it was...

1064
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:07,996
it was an unfortunate
tragedy that had no cause.

1065
00:53:07,998 --> 00:53:11,834
There was no reason that she was stillborn.

1066
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:23,478
And I'm very passionate about
trying to ensure that, you know,

1067
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,179
we don't have parents blaming themselves,

1068
00:53:26,181 --> 00:53:27,681
or feeling guilty

1069
00:53:27,683 --> 00:53:32,553
because they're, you know,
feeding their kids GMOs.

1070
00:53:32,555 --> 00:53:36,591
It infuriates me when
these groups use tragedy

1071
00:53:36,593 --> 00:53:40,228
to advance their cause in the absence

1072
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:42,732
of any scientific evidence.

1073
00:53:46,837 --> 00:53:50,871
I'm aware that when I
give a talk about GMOs,

1074
00:53:50,873 --> 00:53:52,208
<i>that moms with kids</i>

1075
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,975
<i>that have diseases or disorders,</i>

1076
00:53:53,977 --> 00:53:55,643
<i>they may be putting together</i>

1077
00:53:55,645 --> 00:53:57,545
that they may have
actually hurt their child

1078
00:53:57,547 --> 00:53:59,547
based on what they ate.

1079
00:53:59,549 --> 00:54:04,685
Cancer, diabetes, obesity,
heart disease, Et Cetera.

1080
00:54:04,687 --> 00:54:09,156
So I carry a huge responsibility,

1081
00:54:09,158 --> 00:54:11,292
knowing that the truth

1082
00:54:11,294 --> 00:54:15,096
about GMOs can generate fear,

1083
00:54:15,098 --> 00:54:17,567
anger, and sadness.

1084
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,080
<i>There are lots of
people in our society</i>

1085
00:54:33,082 --> 00:54:35,616
<i>who will prey upon people.</i>

1086
00:54:35,618 --> 00:54:39,487
And they appeal to their fears and worries,

1087
00:54:39,489 --> 00:54:43,190
and they give them
answers... absolute answers

1088
00:54:43,192 --> 00:54:46,094
to where, like so many things...

1089
00:54:46,096 --> 00:54:49,531
like most things in life,
there are no absolute answers.

1090
00:54:49,533 --> 00:54:53,268
<i>I think, as a mother,
one of the big catalysts</i>

1091
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:55,536
is the messaging that's coming across is

1092
00:54:55,538 --> 00:54:58,306
that GMOs equal pesticides.

1093
00:54:58,308 --> 00:55:00,607
And people get that pesticides kill things.

1094
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:03,779
And when mothers and...
and consumers understand,

1095
00:55:03,781 --> 00:55:04,946
they're like, "Whoa.

1096
00:55:04,948 --> 00:55:07,515
There's a really good
reason to eat organic."

1097
00:55:07,517 --> 00:55:10,484
Do you think some in the
organic, natural foods

1098
00:55:10,486 --> 00:55:14,989
industries use fear to sell products?

1099
00:55:14,991 --> 00:55:17,859
Well, you know...

1100
00:55:17,861 --> 00:55:22,529
Again, the... the organic industry is...

1101
00:55:22,531 --> 00:55:26,000
is got a lot of different players in it.

1102
00:55:26,002 --> 00:55:30,538
And, yeah, I think some...
particularly activists...

1103
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,507
<i>Jeffery Smith is an example</i>

1104
00:55:33,509 --> 00:55:37,513
of a number of anti-GMO activists

1105
00:55:37,515 --> 00:55:40,915
that are very entrepreneurial.

1106
00:55:42,386 --> 00:55:44,384
Store. Books.

1107
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:46,487
<i>I wrote 'em and I made 'em.
The movie "Genetic Roulette"</i>

1108
00:55:46,489 --> 00:55:49,757
<i>has been the fastest conversion
tool we've ever found</i>

1109
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,893
<i>to convert someone
to a non-GMO diet.</i>

1110
00:55:51,895 --> 00:55:55,295
<i>You know, I think people like
Jeffery Smith use... use fear,</i>

1111
00:55:55,297 --> 00:55:57,232
and... and really go beyond science.

1112
00:55:57,234 --> 00:56:00,935
You can't trust the chemicals
and the food-like substances

1113
00:56:00,937 --> 00:56:02,870
that are being pumped into our food,

1114
00:56:02,872 --> 00:56:06,005
<i>because there's only
one benefit to them.</i>

1115
00:56:06,007 --> 00:56:08,609
<i>It's to them and not us.</i>

1116
00:56:08,611 --> 00:56:10,212
So who can you trust?

1117
00:56:10,214 --> 00:56:12,246
You can trust Mother Nature.

1118
00:56:12,248 --> 00:56:13,882
Okay. Food Babe.

1119
00:56:13,884 --> 00:56:15,884
"Thanks for stopping by the Food Babe shop.

1120
00:56:15,886 --> 00:56:18,486
Below are food items that
I enjoy on a daily basis."

1121
00:56:18,488 --> 00:56:20,054
Organic raw almond butter.

1122
00:56:20,056 --> 00:56:22,556
"This shop contains
affiliate links for products

1123
00:56:22,558 --> 00:56:25,493
the Food Babe has approved
and researched herself."

1124
00:56:25,495 --> 00:56:28,027
Hmm. "And Food Babe will
automatically receive

1125
00:56:28,029 --> 00:56:29,629
a small referral fee."

1126
00:56:29,631 --> 00:56:32,100
Frankly, I trust the social
media, like blogs like

1127
00:56:32,102 --> 00:56:36,103
you know, Vani Hari's or other
moms that even just do a post.

1128
00:56:36,105 --> 00:56:39,540
I trust what they say more
than most medical doctors,

1129
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:41,074
more than the CDC,

1130
00:56:41,076 --> 00:56:43,511
more than the FDA, more than the USDA,

1131
00:56:43,513 --> 00:56:45,645
more than the EPA. That's real.

1132
00:56:45,647 --> 00:56:47,783
I don't need a scientific study for that.

1133
00:56:47,785 --> 00:56:49,819
I don't need a doctor to tell me that.

1134
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:54,723
Okay, I can buy Restore for gut health.

1135
00:56:54,725 --> 00:56:56,156
"Restore has been tested for

1136
00:56:56,158 --> 00:56:57,958
"and shown to support resilience of cells

1137
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,261
"to the most widely used herbicide

1138
00:57:00,263 --> 00:57:02,297
"in the world, glyphosate.

1139
00:57:02,299 --> 00:57:04,199
To put it simply, Restore works."

1140
00:57:04,201 --> 00:57:08,203
I'm deeply troubled by
the sort of erosion of...

1141
00:57:08,205 --> 00:57:10,038
of the integrity of science,

1142
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,440
and the whole debate about
genetically engineered food;

1143
00:57:13,442 --> 00:57:15,944
the... the point, counterpoint,

1144
00:57:15,946 --> 00:57:18,779
he said, she said that... that's going on.

1145
00:57:18,781 --> 00:57:23,451
I don't think that the science supports

1146
00:57:23,453 --> 00:57:27,489
such a wide array of "opinions."

1147
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:29,357
People may say, "Oh, you shouldn't trust

1148
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,824
everything you read on Facebook,"

1149
00:57:30,826 --> 00:57:33,094
or whatever, but what other motivation

1150
00:57:33,096 --> 00:57:34,497
would that person have?

1151
00:57:37,435 --> 00:57:39,033
When a patient would come in to see me

1152
00:57:39,035 --> 00:57:41,000
and they'd... they'd say,
"Well, what do you think

1153
00:57:41,002 --> 00:57:43,038
I should do about this problem, Doc?"

1154
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,873
I wouldn't tell them what I believe.

1155
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:49,143
I'd tell them what we know that
has been shown to be helpful

1156
00:57:49,145 --> 00:57:51,745
and what has been shown to be harmful.

1157
00:57:51,747 --> 00:57:53,346
<i>When you look at the science,</i>

1158
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:56,216
<i>we know that it's important
to eat whole foods.</i>

1159
00:57:56,218 --> 00:58:00,788
To eat lots of fruits and
vegetables and whole grains.

1160
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:03,491
We don't know that you're
going to be healthier

1161
00:58:03,493 --> 00:58:05,226
if those products are organic.

1162
00:58:05,228 --> 00:58:09,230
So please buy fruits and
vegetables and whole grains,

1163
00:58:09,232 --> 00:58:10,799
and don't worry whether they're

1164
00:58:10,801 --> 00:58:14,000
organically produced or
not organically produced.

1165
00:58:14,002 --> 00:58:17,071
It's like the... the issue
of vaccinations, really.

1166
00:58:17,073 --> 00:58:21,509
You can try and have public
information campaigns,

1167
00:58:21,511 --> 00:58:23,578
but it's much easier to scare people

1168
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,344
than it is to reassure them.

1169
00:58:25,346 --> 00:58:28,783
And the misinformation
originates in the rich world,

1170
00:58:28,785 --> 00:58:31,686
and it's damaging the
interests of the poor world.

1171
00:58:49,707 --> 00:58:53,274
<i>We do everything similar
to what farmer does.</i>

1172
00:58:53,276 --> 00:58:54,341
No fertilizer.

1173
00:58:54,343 --> 00:58:57,812
No pesticide. No insecticide.

1174
00:58:57,814 --> 00:58:59,980
See, the control plant has the disease,

1175
00:58:59,982 --> 00:59:01,817
and the control plant completely wilted.

1176
00:59:01,819 --> 00:59:05,520
But our transgenic plant
has... has no disease.

1177
00:59:05,522 --> 00:59:09,623
So actually, all of our
genetically modified plants,

1178
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:12,094
all have the 100% resistance.

1179
00:59:12,096 --> 00:59:14,862
It was quite amazing to
see Leena's GMO plants

1180
00:59:14,864 --> 00:59:19,734
that were resistant to the
banana bacterial disease.

1181
00:59:19,736 --> 00:59:21,002
You can touch it.

1182
00:59:21,004 --> 00:59:23,872
Even the fruits, you can touch them.

1183
00:59:29,212 --> 00:59:31,112
<i>I want to know that they actually...</i>

1184
00:59:31,114 --> 00:59:33,649
GMOs are not bad like they used to say.

1185
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,455
Even better.

1186
00:59:39,457 --> 00:59:41,591
So it does well.

1187
00:59:53,904 --> 00:59:55,404
I don't know why they don't consider.

1188
00:59:55,406 --> 00:59:58,672
Maybe we have to, like,
change their perception

1189
00:59:58,674 --> 01:00:00,274
for that, you know?

1190
01:00:00,276 --> 01:00:03,678
The government has to be
forced to put the law in place.

1191
01:00:05,214 --> 01:00:09,616
<i>When I saw Frances' face,
she also could not believe</i>

1192
01:00:09,618 --> 01:00:11,685
<i>that there was an
answer to her problem.</i>

1193
01:00:11,687 --> 01:00:16,422
<i>And she was like, "Can you give
us these plants yesterday?"</i>

1194
01:00:19,395 --> 01:00:21,062
<i>But it was so sad.</i>

1195
01:00:21,064 --> 01:00:23,897
<i>She could not get the GMO plants.</i>

1196
01:00:23,899 --> 01:00:25,533
<i>That she had to wait
for another two, three,</i>

1197
01:00:25,535 --> 01:00:29,203
<i>four years for the
research to be approved.</i>

1198
01:00:37,546 --> 01:00:40,348
This is as close to being a
scientist as I'll ever get.

1199
01:00:42,951 --> 01:00:47,121
<i>All of you have put so much time,</i>

1200
01:00:47,123 --> 01:00:50,158
<i>effort... your life's
work, basically,</i>

1201
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:55,027
<i>is this plant that people are
having these big debates about.</i>

1202
01:00:55,029 --> 01:00:57,031
How frustrating is that, for you?

1203
01:00:57,033 --> 01:00:59,866
What I see is how far
we have come, you know?

1204
01:00:59,868 --> 01:01:02,304
It's like, we have, now a
solution for the farmers.

1205
01:01:02,306 --> 01:01:03,973
So, you know. That... that good enough

1206
01:01:03,975 --> 01:01:06,040
to motivate me to do something more,

1207
01:01:06,042 --> 01:01:09,710
to convince the people who are
negative about this technology.

1208
01:01:09,712 --> 01:01:11,478
Give them the scientific facts.

1209
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,982
And... and I feel like
we can convince them.

1210
01:01:13,984 --> 01:01:19,487
I am not convinced that
you can convince them.

1211
01:01:19,489 --> 01:01:23,558
One of the things that has
been most difficult for me...

1212
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,993
is understanding

1213
01:01:24,995 --> 01:01:27,895
how human beings make decisions.

1214
01:01:27,897 --> 01:01:30,498
We don't make decisions based on facts.

1215
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,833
We make decisions based on our gut.

1216
01:01:33,835 --> 01:01:35,136
And there's... you know.

1217
01:01:35,138 --> 01:01:37,004
It's some combination of intuition

1218
01:01:37,006 --> 01:01:40,609
and emotion and affiliation.

1219
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:42,009
I need to ask you,

1220
01:01:42,011 --> 01:01:45,714
when was the last time you
changed <i>your</i> mind?

1221
01:01:45,716 --> 01:01:47,114
Think about it.

1222
01:01:47,116 --> 01:01:50,451
In the last year, have
you changed your mind

1223
01:01:50,453 --> 01:01:53,353
about an issue of substance?

1224
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:02,763
And they haven't done anything for Africa.

1225
01:02:02,765 --> 01:02:04,964
The... the lame shall not walk.

1226
01:02:04,966 --> 01:02:06,734
<i>The blind shall not see.</i>

1227
01:02:06,736 --> 01:02:09,703
<i>The hungry shall not be fed.</i>

1228
01:02:15,411 --> 01:02:19,214
Technology doesn't have
a moral valence, you know.

1229
01:02:19,216 --> 01:02:22,415
It's... it's how the technology is used.

1230
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:24,786
Is the hammer used to... to pound in nails

1231
01:02:24,788 --> 01:02:26,420
and build a house for the poor,

1232
01:02:26,422 --> 01:02:30,325
or is it used to bash in
the head of your neighbor?

1233
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:49,544
<i>We are now struggling
within the conventional</i>

1234
01:02:49,546 --> 01:02:53,047
<i>system of producing food.</i>

1235
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:55,315
<i>Climate change is a reality.</i>

1236
01:02:55,317 --> 01:03:01,254
<i>You know, I am awaiting another
GM seed for drought tolerance.</i>

1237
01:03:01,256 --> 01:03:07,495
<i>I'm waiting really impatiently,
because we are losing here.</i>

1238
01:03:10,966 --> 01:03:12,565
This has been about ten days of drought,

1239
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:14,169
and then a month of recovery.

1240
01:03:14,171 --> 01:03:16,571
Our engineered lines recovered,
as you see, much better,

1241
01:03:16,573 --> 01:03:20,375
while the background control
line, they did not recover.

1242
01:03:20,377 --> 01:03:21,576
They died.

1243
01:03:21,578 --> 01:03:24,076
Wow. They're incredible.

1244
01:03:24,078 --> 01:03:25,913
If we can reproduce this in the field,

1245
01:03:25,915 --> 01:03:29,949
it could have a huge,
huge effect for farmers.

1246
01:03:29,951 --> 01:03:31,585
Genetic engineered rice? Been stopped.

1247
01:03:31,587 --> 01:03:32,721
No commercialization.

1248
01:03:32,723 --> 01:03:34,187
It's gone.

1249
01:03:34,189 --> 01:03:36,024
Then we stopped genetically
engineered alfalfa.

1250
01:03:36,026 --> 01:03:38,025
We sued 'em and we beat 'em.

1251
01:03:38,027 --> 01:03:40,127
Those are gone. Not gonna happen.

1252
01:03:40,129 --> 01:03:43,364
<i>Not gonna happen.</i>

1253
01:03:43,366 --> 01:03:45,431
<i>Americans, beware.</i>

1254
01:03:45,433 --> 01:03:48,270
<i>Please, be informed that</i>

1255
01:03:48,272 --> 01:03:54,076
whenever you say no to GM technology,

1256
01:03:54,078 --> 01:03:58,246
you are suppressing Africa.

1257
01:03:58,248 --> 01:04:02,047
South Africa and the rest of the continent

1258
01:04:02,049 --> 01:04:04,786
is being left behind.

1259
01:04:31,114 --> 01:04:33,013
<i>With the global divide over GMOs</i>

1260
01:04:33,015 --> 01:04:35,147
<i>getting more contentious every day,</i>

1261
01:04:35,149 --> 01:04:37,953
<i>the respected debate
series Intelligence Squared</i>

1262
01:04:37,955 --> 01:04:40,221
<i>invited top experts on both sides</i>

1263
01:04:40,223 --> 01:04:43,625
<i>for a civil discourse in
front of a live audience.</i>

1264
01:04:47,462 --> 01:04:49,998
Okay, we're letting
everybody get settled in.

1265
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,232
We have four debaters, two teams of two,

1266
01:04:52,234 --> 01:04:54,301
arguing it out over this motion:

1267
01:04:54,303 --> 01:04:56,036
Genetically Modified Food.

1268
01:04:56,038 --> 01:04:58,973
And is this a good thing,
this genetic engineering?

1269
01:04:58,975 --> 01:05:01,475
Is it a safe thing? Is it necessary?

1270
01:05:01,477 --> 01:05:04,612
Well, those questions sound
like the makings of a debate.

1271
01:05:04,614 --> 01:05:05,714
So let's have it.

1272
01:05:05,716 --> 01:05:08,114
Yes or no to this statement:

1273
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:10,951
genetically modify food.

1274
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:18,458
Chuck, you are at Washington State.

1275
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,362
You are known for your research
on pesticide use, in particular.

1276
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:23,830
You've debated with us before, actually.

1277
01:05:23,832 --> 01:05:27,034
You were a proponent of organic food,

1278
01:05:27,036 --> 01:05:29,536
and you won overwhelmingly.

1279
01:05:29,538 --> 01:05:31,504
So are you feeling lucky again tonight?

1280
01:05:31,506 --> 01:05:33,040
I am, John.

1281
01:05:33,042 --> 01:05:35,141
We've... we're well-prepared, Marty and I,

1282
01:05:35,143 --> 01:05:37,879
and since we have the facts
and science on our side,

1283
01:05:37,881 --> 01:05:39,147
I think we'll be fine.

1284
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:44,185
Part of me was reticent to do it,

1285
01:05:44,187 --> 01:05:45,819
because, I thought it was a bit

1286
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:49,056
<i>a no-win scenario in the
middle of New York City.</i>

1287
01:05:49,058 --> 01:05:51,692
<i>And also, sitting
alongside Robb Fraley,</i>

1288
01:05:51,694 --> 01:05:53,928
<i>who, obviously, is with Monsanto,</i>

1289
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:55,797
and just... all of the baggage that comes

1290
01:05:55,799 --> 01:05:57,797
with that particular company.

1291
01:05:57,799 --> 01:06:00,935
Here to argue for the motion,
please welcome Robert Fraley.

1292
01:06:00,937 --> 01:06:02,736
He is executive vice president

1293
01:06:02,738 --> 01:06:05,239
and chief technology officer at Monsanto.

1294
01:06:05,241 --> 01:06:07,007
Ladies and gentlemen, Robert Fraley.

1295
01:06:10,846 --> 01:06:12,214
I'm hearing hissing.

1296
01:06:12,216 --> 01:06:14,413
I would appreciate the
audience silence the hisser.

1297
01:06:14,415 --> 01:06:19,152
I absolutely think that
trust is the central issue

1298
01:06:19,154 --> 01:06:24,091
when it comes to Americans'
relationship with food.

1299
01:06:24,093 --> 01:06:27,462
First of all, GMOs are not the holy grail.

1300
01:06:27,464 --> 01:06:29,531
What they are is an important tool.

1301
01:06:29,533 --> 01:06:31,998
They've enabled farmers to use safer

1302
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,169
and more environmentally
friendly chemicals.

1303
01:06:35,171 --> 01:06:36,603
GMOs: are they perfect?

1304
01:06:36,605 --> 01:06:37,770
Absolutely not.

1305
01:06:37,772 --> 01:06:39,473
They need to be regulated.

1306
01:06:39,475 --> 01:06:42,976
They need to be managed wisely
like... like any technology.

1307
01:06:42,978 --> 01:06:45,147
I was there in the early days

1308
01:06:45,149 --> 01:06:48,415
when Monsanto came up with its products.

1309
01:06:48,417 --> 01:06:52,685
And compared to the
vision... the early vision,

1310
01:06:52,687 --> 01:06:54,254
it's a big disappointment.

1311
01:06:54,256 --> 01:06:56,958
GMO technology often gets conflated

1312
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,092
with Monsanto and Big Ag.

1313
01:06:59,094 --> 01:07:00,928
But it's actually a breeding tool,

1314
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:03,098
one that can be used for many purposes.

1315
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,665
All of these GM applications

1316
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:07,768
focus on controlling disease with genetics

1317
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:09,402
rather than chemicals,

1318
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:11,237
an objective that I would argue

1319
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:14,473
is compatible with
agroecology, sustainability,

1320
01:07:14,475 --> 01:07:17,844
and feeding more people better
with less environmental impact.

1321
01:07:17,846 --> 01:07:21,214
Robb and Allison, if... if
all of what you said was true,

1322
01:07:21,216 --> 01:07:24,585
I would be over there
at your side of the table

1323
01:07:24,587 --> 01:07:25,920
going at it with...

1324
01:07:25,922 --> 01:07:29,491
with poor Marty all by herself.

1325
01:07:29,493 --> 01:07:31,290
Rest assured, there is no consensus

1326
01:07:31,292 --> 01:07:33,060
about the safety of GE foods.

1327
01:07:33,062 --> 01:07:34,429
At some point, you know,

1328
01:07:34,431 --> 01:07:36,362
consensus doesn't mean everybody agrees.

1329
01:07:36,364 --> 01:07:38,966
It doesn't mean that there's
a complete 100% alignment,

1330
01:07:38,968 --> 01:07:40,567
just like there isn't on global warming.

1331
01:07:40,569 --> 01:07:42,435
But the science speaks for itself here,

1332
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:45,138
and... and the science has
reached a consensus on this.

1333
01:07:46,676 --> 01:07:49,341
<i>We live in an age of
so much information.</i>

1334
01:07:49,343 --> 01:07:52,145
The individual sees one
article say one thing,

1335
01:07:52,147 --> 01:07:53,846
and another article say the other thing,

1336
01:07:53,848 --> 01:07:57,085
and the individual can only
weight these the same way,

1337
01:07:57,087 --> 01:07:59,252
and that creates dissonance.

1338
01:07:59,254 --> 01:08:01,288
That creates a lot of confusion.

1339
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:04,658
And dissonance and
confusion create distrust.

1340
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,993
John asked about to...
to open up a discussion

1341
01:08:06,995 --> 01:08:08,862
of the environmental impacts.

1342
01:08:08,864 --> 01:08:12,232
When you spray one herbicide over

1343
01:08:12,234 --> 01:08:14,770
and over again on weeds,

1344
01:08:14,772 --> 01:08:16,570
they're going to develop resistance.

1345
01:08:16,572 --> 01:08:18,239
Okay. I'm... so I want to
take that to Robb Fraley.

1346
01:08:18,241 --> 01:08:20,208
You've all heard of antibiotic resistance.

1347
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:22,441
It's a problem, right? You're aware of it.

1348
01:08:22,443 --> 01:08:24,044
So what should drug companies do?

1349
01:08:24,046 --> 01:08:25,746
Should they not develop new antibiotics

1350
01:08:25,748 --> 01:08:27,013
just because there's
become a resistance to...

1351
01:08:27,015 --> 01:08:29,150
to an antibiotic?

1352
01:08:29,152 --> 01:08:30,951
Absolutely not.

1353
01:08:30,953 --> 01:08:32,520
Roundup controls hundreds of weeds.

1354
01:08:32,522 --> 01:08:35,155
In this country, 12 of
them have become resistant.

1355
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:37,357
It still controls hundreds of weeds.

1356
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:38,892
It needs to be used effectively.

1357
01:08:38,894 --> 01:08:40,995
And, Chuck, you were one of
the first ones to point out

1358
01:08:40,997 --> 01:08:44,130
that we should actually use
combinations of herbicides,

1359
01:08:44,132 --> 01:08:46,133
and that's what growers are doing today,

1360
01:08:46,135 --> 01:08:48,302
and that's one of the
benefits of being smarter

1361
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:51,873
and stewarding these products better.

1362
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:54,240
Yes. That... that's true. I mean...

1363
01:08:56,045 --> 01:08:58,579
The challenge of feeding
the world's hungry people

1364
01:08:58,581 --> 01:09:02,049
is not one that is met
by production of any kind.

1365
01:09:02,051 --> 01:09:05,718
I mean, if you want to feed
hungry people around the world,

1366
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,388
I can give you a list of ten things to do.

1367
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:11,624
You can build roads. You
can raise their incomes.

1368
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:13,794
You can change the role of women.

1369
01:09:13,796 --> 01:09:15,862
You can help people
make their own decisions

1370
01:09:15,864 --> 01:09:18,332
about what they want to
grow and help them grow it.

1371
01:09:18,334 --> 01:09:21,168
I... I absolutely agree.
It's a complicated question

1372
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:23,637
that will take all of the tools we have.

1373
01:09:23,639 --> 01:09:25,039
- Robb...
- So I couldn't agree more.

1374
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:26,240
One... one part of,

1375
01:09:26,242 --> 01:09:27,707
I think, of Margaret's argument

1376
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:30,311
is that the focus on
genetically engineered crops

1377
01:09:30,313 --> 01:09:32,745
sort of sucks the oxygen out of the room.

1378
01:09:32,747 --> 01:09:35,917
I... I think the debate
around GMO crops sucks

1379
01:09:35,919 --> 01:09:39,852
all the air out of the room.

1380
01:09:39,854 --> 01:09:43,823
<i>The GMO debate is not about
GMOs at all, at this point.</i>

1381
01:09:43,825 --> 01:09:47,661
GMOs are a metaphor for our relationship

1382
01:09:47,663 --> 01:09:50,496
with food and our food system.

1383
01:09:50,498 --> 01:09:52,734
And here to give his closing statement

1384
01:09:52,736 --> 01:09:54,767
against this motion, Chuck Benbrook.

1385
01:09:54,769 --> 01:09:58,874
It's really turned into kind
of a arms race with weeds,

1386
01:09:58,876 --> 01:10:03,311
using herbicides as the sole hammer.

1387
01:10:03,313 --> 01:10:06,012
The 2014 USDA data shows pretty clearly

1388
01:10:06,014 --> 01:10:10,718
it's about 230 million pounds
of glyphosate was applied.

1389
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,352
Even though it's generally regarded

1390
01:10:12,354 --> 01:10:14,556
as a relatively safe pesticide,

1391
01:10:14,558 --> 01:10:17,591
there's reason for serious worry here.

1392
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:20,527
Sometimes the risks that concern people

1393
01:10:20,529 --> 01:10:24,263
and the risks that kill
people are entirely different.

1394
01:10:24,265 --> 01:10:26,634
For too long, the debate over the merits

1395
01:10:26,636 --> 01:10:28,369
of genetically modified food

1396
01:10:28,371 --> 01:10:31,138
has focused on unrealized
hypothetical risks

1397
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:34,473
and has been conflated
with the use of pesticides.

1398
01:10:34,475 --> 01:10:37,344
It has not addressed how GM could help

1399
01:10:37,346 --> 01:10:38,678
with the very real risks

1400
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,713
faced by hungry and malnourished.

1401
01:10:40,715 --> 01:10:44,418
There are costs associated
to excessive precaution.

1402
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,520
Vote "yes" for GM food.

1403
01:10:46,522 --> 01:10:49,289
This is obviously a very,
very passionate debate.

1404
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:50,557
If you side with this motion,

1405
01:10:50,559 --> 01:10:52,191
and with this team, push number one.

1406
01:10:52,193 --> 01:10:54,628
Against the motion and
this team, push number two.

1407
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:57,698
<i>Confirmation bias
is people's tendency</i>

1408
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:01,767
<i>to only assimilate
information which confirms</i>

1409
01:11:01,769 --> 01:11:04,170
<i>what they already believe.
And everybody does it.</i>

1410
01:11:04,172 --> 01:11:07,973
I mean, confirmation bias is
why right wingers watch Fox News

1411
01:11:07,975 --> 01:11:10,378
and left wingers read
"The Guardian" online.

1412
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:12,611
It feels more comfortable
to read information

1413
01:11:12,613 --> 01:11:14,548
which tells you that you're right.

1414
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:17,551
You know, confirmation bias
has a... has a function,

1415
01:11:17,553 --> 01:11:19,151
almost in terms of mental health.

1416
01:11:19,153 --> 01:11:21,289
Keeping you feeling sane,
and like you know... you know

1417
01:11:21,291 --> 01:11:23,390
how... you understand how the world works.

1418
01:11:23,392 --> 01:11:25,927
But confirmation bias
is also very dangerous,

1419
01:11:25,929 --> 01:11:31,164
because it means that we
don't listen to evidence

1420
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:33,236
which challenges our beliefs.

1421
01:11:35,069 --> 01:11:36,669
Let's look at the first vote.

1422
01:11:36,671 --> 01:11:38,173
In the first vote on the motion

1423
01:11:38,175 --> 01:11:40,173
"Genetically Modified Food,"

1424
01:11:40,175 --> 01:11:43,076
32% agreed, 30% were against,

1425
01:11:43,078 --> 01:11:45,277
38% were undecided.

1426
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:47,213
Those are the first results.

1427
01:11:47,215 --> 01:11:49,249
Remember, again, the team
whose numbers change the most

1428
01:11:49,251 --> 01:11:52,151
between first and second
will be declared our winner.

1429
01:11:52,153 --> 01:11:53,887
Let's look at the second vote.

1430
01:11:53,889 --> 01:11:55,455
The team arguing for the motion,
their second vote was 60%.

1431
01:11:55,457 --> 01:11:58,491
They went from 32% to 60%.

1432
01:11:58,493 --> 01:12:00,360
They picked up 28 percentage points.

1433
01:12:00,362 --> 01:12:02,027
That is the number to beat.

1434
01:12:02,029 --> 01:12:03,463
But let's look at the
team against the motion.

1435
01:12:03,465 --> 01:12:04,832
Their first vote was 30%.

1436
01:12:04,834 --> 01:12:07,767
Second vote, only 31%. Only a 1% move.

1437
01:12:07,769 --> 01:12:10,236
That means the team arguing for the motion

1438
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:13,005
"Genetically Modified Food"
has carried this debate.

1439
01:12:13,007 --> 01:12:15,477
Our congratulations to
them, and thank you from me,

1440
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:17,311
John Donvan and Intelligence Squared U.S.

1441
01:12:17,313 --> 01:12:19,012
We'll see you next time.

1442
01:12:20,616 --> 01:12:22,516
Yeah, it's self-fulfilling. And money.

1443
01:12:22,518 --> 01:12:24,618
Money is behind the
whole thing with Monsanto.

1444
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:28,923
And Syngenta, Dow, DuPont.
These are all, all...

1445
01:12:28,925 --> 01:12:31,156
I don't know. He's just...
he's so charismatic.

1446
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:32,959
He was just so good.

1447
01:12:32,961 --> 01:12:34,294
Well, he was good.

1448
01:12:34,296 --> 01:12:35,962
You convinced my husband and I.

1449
01:12:35,964 --> 01:12:38,065
Good job. Well, thank you for coming.

1450
01:12:38,067 --> 01:12:39,633
What did you think of it?

1451
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:42,369
It's the first time I've
seen science win a debate.

1452
01:12:42,371 --> 01:12:43,503
And I was also struck by just how

1453
01:12:43,505 --> 01:12:45,239
weak the arguments are for the antis.

1454
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:48,208
There was nothing even remotely persuasive.

1455
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:49,410
"The thing we've been trying to stop

1456
01:12:49,412 --> 01:12:52,178
for 15 years hasn't worked yet."

1457
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:53,614
Now, what kind of argument is that?

1458
01:12:53,616 --> 01:12:55,616
There's really no food that's 100% safe,

1459
01:12:55,618 --> 01:12:57,183
and even the turkey dinner you had

1460
01:12:57,185 --> 01:12:59,553
for Thanksgiving had some
risk associated with it.

1461
01:12:59,555 --> 01:13:02,755
And so you have to kind of
manage that risk. And so...

1462
01:13:02,757 --> 01:13:04,057
I'm wondering... I didn't
quite get your position.

1463
01:13:04,059 --> 01:13:06,459
Are you for herbicide tolerant crops?

1464
01:13:06,461 --> 01:13:08,695
Would you support them? Do
you think... if this debate

1465
01:13:08,697 --> 01:13:11,231
was just for or against,
not the other apps?

1466
01:13:11,233 --> 01:13:12,534
You know Humboldt County just banned

1467
01:13:12,536 --> 01:13:14,301
- genetically modified crops.
- Yes.

1468
01:13:14,303 --> 01:13:15,567
So I was talking to a farmer up there

1469
01:13:15,569 --> 01:13:17,739
who grows Roundup Ready corn.

1470
01:13:17,741 --> 01:13:19,338
And I said to him, "What
are you going to do,

1471
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:20,707
now that it's been banned?"

1472
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:23,511
And he said, well, "I'll
obey the... the ban.

1473
01:13:23,513 --> 01:13:25,978
"I'll grow conventional corn.

1474
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,950
And I'll go back to using
a more toxic herbicide."

1475
01:13:28,952 --> 01:13:30,950
That is the consequence of that ban.

1476
01:13:30,952 --> 01:13:32,252
For... there are good applications.

1477
01:13:32,254 --> 01:13:33,553
I'm not debating you on this.

1478
01:13:33,555 --> 01:13:34,821
There may be some good ones, fine.

1479
01:13:34,823 --> 01:13:36,623
But that app is a very bad app.

1480
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:38,726
Support the good apps,
and say, "You know, guys?

1481
01:13:38,728 --> 01:13:40,727
This is not an application you should use."

1482
01:13:40,729 --> 01:13:43,228
- Hi.
- Hi.

1483
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:47,333
<i>They haven't done
anything for Africa.</i>

1484
01:13:47,335 --> 01:13:49,570
<i>The lame shall not walk.</i>

1485
01:13:49,572 --> 01:13:51,172
<i>The blind shall not see.</i>

1486
01:13:51,174 --> 01:13:54,642
<i>The hungry shall not be fed.</i>

1487
01:13:54,644 --> 01:13:56,677
When Andrew Kimbrell acknowledged

1488
01:13:56,679 --> 01:13:59,945
that there were good apps for GMOs,

1489
01:13:59,947 --> 01:14:01,615
either that was a slip of the tongue,

1490
01:14:01,617 --> 01:14:03,717
or that was an incredibly
meaningful admission.

1491
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:06,786
Because I've never heard
anyone of his stature

1492
01:14:06,788 --> 01:14:09,655
in the anti-GMO movement
admit that this technology

1493
01:14:09,657 --> 01:14:12,692
can ever have a beneficial purpose.

1494
01:14:15,663 --> 01:14:17,431
<i>Well, let me ask you this.</i>

1495
01:14:17,433 --> 01:14:19,267
Is it true or false

1496
01:14:19,269 --> 01:14:23,704
that this technology has
increased the use of pesticides?

1497
01:14:23,706 --> 01:14:25,638
It has decreased the use of pesticides.

1498
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:27,406
That's the... that's
where you guys don't agree.

1499
01:14:27,408 --> 01:14:28,976
That's what the science says.

1500
01:14:28,978 --> 01:14:30,677
So that's something I want to look into.

1501
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:32,378
So that right there,
I can investigate that.

1502
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:34,214
And papaya doesn't use anything.

1503
01:14:34,216 --> 01:14:36,382
The papaya is pretty impressive.

1504
01:14:36,384 --> 01:14:37,650
So, everybody, for you recording,

1505
01:14:37,652 --> 01:14:39,119
this is something I'm gonna look into.

1506
01:14:39,121 --> 01:14:43,823
Does it increase or decrease
the use of pesticides?

1507
01:14:43,825 --> 01:14:46,560
Don't forget, look at
the lens not at yourself.

1508
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:49,530
<i>Thanks, Bill. I appreciate it.</i>

1509
01:14:49,532 --> 01:14:50,932
- <i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>
- <i>Pleasure to meet you.</i>

1510
01:14:50,934 --> 01:14:53,066
- Yes.
- Selfie with the Science Guy!

1511
01:14:53,068 --> 01:14:55,703
So excited!

1512
01:14:55,705 --> 01:14:57,337
My kids love him, and so...

1513
01:14:57,339 --> 01:14:59,306
well, 'cause we're all kind
of science nerds, right?

1514
01:14:59,308 --> 01:15:03,076
So that's gonna really amplify
my status at home, I think,

1515
01:15:03,078 --> 01:15:08,882
and maybe make them understand
what I was doing here, so...

1516
01:15:08,884 --> 01:15:10,783
Thanks so much for your support, dude.

1517
01:15:10,785 --> 01:15:12,253
Really, really appreciate it.

1518
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,788
I'm so excited about
getting heavily into meat.

1519
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:16,422
Because I've been kind of captured

1520
01:15:16,424 --> 01:15:19,660
by GMO stuff for it seems like forever.

1521
01:15:19,662 --> 01:15:21,460
Well, we're happy we could throw you

1522
01:15:21,462 --> 01:15:22,963
something new to work on.

1523
01:15:22,965 --> 01:15:24,298
Yep. Yep.

1524
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:27,467
<i>While Benbrook's side
lost this GMO debate,</i>

1525
01:15:27,469 --> 01:15:30,737
<i>his influence and his
story didn't end there.</i>

1526
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:34,409
I'm deeply troubled by
the sort of erosion of...

1527
01:15:34,411 --> 01:15:36,244
of the integrity of science

1528
01:15:36,246 --> 01:15:39,880
and the whole debate about
genetically engineered food.

1529
01:15:39,882 --> 01:15:43,016
<i>One study coauthored by
Washington State University</i>

1530
01:15:43,018 --> 01:15:44,918

1531
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,655

1533
01:15:49,357 --> 01:15:54,761

1534
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:56,797
<i>His work has been quoted, shared,</i>

<i>against this technology...</i>

1539
01:16:04,107 --> 01:16:08,008
Our major finding is that
while all milk is healthy,

01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:10,276
<i>organic milk is even healthier.</i>

1541
01:16:10,278 --> 01:16:15,048

01:16:43,011 --> 01:16:46,079
<i>"The New York Times" discovered
that Benbrook's studies</i>

1547
01:16:46,081 --> 01:16:50,048
<i>may not have been as
independent as he portrayed.</i>

1548
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:54,887
<i>What I've seen is that
he is willing to actually</i>

1549
01:16:54,889 --> 01:16:57,859
<i>take funding to provide
particular outcomes.</i>

1550
01:16:57,861 --> 01:16:59,692
<i>And that's really the antithesis</i>

1551
01:16:59,694 --> 01:17:01,660
<i>of what a scientist
is prepared to do.</i>

1552
01:17:01,662 --> 01:17:04,999
Scientists will usually...
if they're funded by industry,

1553
01:17:05,001 --> 01:17:07,633
<i>it's... it's an unrestricted grant.</i>

1554
01:17:07,635 --> 01:17:09,302
<i>There's no outcomes expected.</i>

1555
01:17:09,304 --> 01:17:11,838
There's certainly no
predetermined conclusions

1556
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,075
as to what the study is going to say.

1557
01:17:14,077 --> 01:17:16,676
That's... that's not how science works,

1558
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:18,378
because the data informs your opinion,

1559
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,013
not who funded you.

1560
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:24,718
<i>Some of the important
funders would be Whole Foods,</i>

1561
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,654
<i>Annie's,</i>

1562
01:17:26,656 --> 01:17:29,722
<i>Organic Valley, Stonyfield.</i>

1563
01:17:29,724 --> 01:17:32,025
<i>Do you think some in the organic</i>

1564
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:34,860
or natural foods industry
have used your work

1565
01:17:34,862 --> 01:17:37,765
to help them sell fear around GMOs?

1566
01:17:37,767 --> 01:17:41,436
I think, I mean, certainly, to some extent,

1567
01:17:41,438 --> 01:17:46,505
that that is how the work
that I did was utilized.

1568
01:17:46,507 --> 01:17:50,677
But the way I feel about it is,

1569
01:17:50,679 --> 01:17:53,047
why shouldn't the organic industry

1570
01:17:53,049 --> 01:17:55,315
have the same right as Monsanto

1571
01:17:55,317 --> 01:17:59,887
or Syngenta or ADM or Kraft Foods?

1572
01:17:59,889 --> 01:18:01,420
Don't you think every company

1573
01:18:01,422 --> 01:18:03,423
on all sides of this debate

1574
01:18:03,425 --> 01:18:04,825
will use whatever science

1575
01:18:04,827 --> 01:18:09,463
they think supports their public posture

1576
01:18:09,465 --> 01:18:10,664
and their messaging?

1577
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:12,298
Of course they're gonna use it.

1578
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,302
But are any of those
companies trying to convince me

1579
01:18:15,304 --> 01:18:18,404
that organic food will give my kids cancer?

1580
01:18:18,406 --> 01:18:19,673
No. I'm not saying that.

1581
01:18:19,675 --> 01:18:21,174
That's what I'm saying.

1582
01:18:21,176 --> 01:18:23,942
<i>Many scientists and
science journalists</i>

1583
01:18:23,944 --> 01:18:25,579
<i>spoke out against the biased</i>

1584
01:18:25,581 --> 01:18:28,481
<i>and misleading information
in Benbrook's work.</i>

1585
01:18:56,344 --> 01:19:00,714
<i>The profit motive is
a double-edged sword.</i>

1586
01:19:01,617 --> 01:19:04,451
<i>It can lead to innovation</i>

1587
01:19:04,453 --> 01:19:09,222
<i>as well as temptation.</i>

1588
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:11,491
<i>When you look at
the people out there</i>

1589
01:19:11,493 --> 01:19:13,959
<i>who are pushing against GMOs</i>

1590
01:19:13,961 --> 01:19:16,230
<i>and who are pushing for GMOs,</i>

1591
01:19:16,232 --> 01:19:20,298
<i>there are real
marketers on both sides.</i>

1592
01:19:25,806 --> 01:19:27,107
And what's interesting to me

1593
01:19:27,109 --> 01:19:30,109
is that you can get past those people.

1594
01:19:30,111 --> 01:19:33,213
You know, there are scientists who,

1595
01:19:33,215 --> 01:19:35,748
their incentive is to be impartial

1596
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:37,049
and to weigh the evidence

1597
01:19:37,051 --> 01:19:39,453
and to figure out real solutions

1598
01:19:39,455 --> 01:19:41,987
and not to push an agenda.

1599
01:19:41,989 --> 01:19:46,226
No GMOs! No GMOs! No GMOs!

1600
01:19:46,228 --> 01:19:48,862
<i>After years of March

1601
01:19:48,864 --> 01:19:51,597

1602
01:19:51,599 --> 01:19:55,401

1606
01:20:01,376 --> 01:20:04,511
<i>Science is completely
counter to being an activist.</i>

1607
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:07,080
I mean, as an activist, you
want to get the megaphone,

1608
01:20:07,082 --> 01:20:09,515
and you want to say,
"These people are doing...

1609
01:20:09,517 --> 01:20:11,285
"you know, they're damaging the planet!

1611
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:15,187
You don't want to stand up
there with a megaphone and say,

1612
01:20:15,189 --> 01:20:16,758
"This is a very subtle issue,
there's lots of complications,

1613
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:18,525

1614
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:20,526
When did you ever hear, "What do we want?"

1615
01:20:20,528 --> 01:20:22,128
"We want peer-reviewed data

1616
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:24,998
which objectively defines
the nature of the problem!"

1617
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,466
"When do we want it?" "When do we want it?

1618
01:20:26,468 --> 01:20:28,334
"Well, at least three years hence,

They want the best for the world.

1631
01:20:55,397 --> 01:20:58,397
They have good intentions,

Boo!

1635
01:21:04,772 --> 01:21:07,208
I'm not fighting for GMOs.

1636
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:09,808
I'm fighting for the ability

1637
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:13,713
to use science to make the
best decisions that we can.

1638
01:21:13,715 --> 01:21:16,517
If you throw science out,
then... then there's nothing.

1639
01:21:16,519 --> 01:21:18,852
There's just kind of an amorphous blob

1640
01:21:18,854 --> 01:21:21,352
of competing worldviews.

1641
01:21:23,225 --> 01:21:25,357
<i>Emma and her husband, Washington,</i>

1642
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:27,360
<i>are expanding their
role as educators</i>

1643
01:21:27,362 --> 01:21:31,196
<i>by building a school to
teach all about food,</i>

1644
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:33,901
<i>farming, and agriculture.</i>

1645
01:21:33,903 --> 01:21:37,736
We visited a farmer whose farm was dying

1646
01:21:37,738 --> 01:21:39,373
because of banana wilt,

1647
01:21:39,375 --> 01:21:41,807
and she was actually dying with it.

1648
01:21:41,809 --> 01:21:46,713
They get a gene that is resistant

1649
01:21:46,715 --> 01:21:48,948
and put it in the matoke.

1650
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:50,883
And the matoke was still matoke.

1651
01:21:50,885 --> 01:21:52,485
With no banana wilt?

1652
01:21:52,487 --> 01:21:54,186
With no banana wilt.

1653
01:21:54,188 --> 01:21:57,124
Does it make sense for that thing to wither

1654
01:21:57,126 --> 01:21:58,757
because you are so against it

1655
01:21:58,759 --> 01:22:00,828
but then at the end of the
day, we don't have food?

1656
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:02,695
What... what does food make us?

1657
01:22:02,697 --> 01:22:05,030
If you don't have food,
then you are going to steal.

1658
01:22:05,032 --> 01:22:06,932
You are going to kill someone.

1659
01:22:06,934 --> 01:22:08,735
A lot of crime.

1660
01:22:08,737 --> 01:22:12,373

01:24:53,903 --> 01:24:56,668
<i>how do we decide which way to go?</i>

1717
01:24:56,670 --> 01:24:58,704
<i>What kind of future will we have</i>

1718
01:24:58,706 --> 01:25:01,507
<i>if we turn our backs
on credible evidence,</i>

1719
01:25:01,509 --> 01:25:05,677
<i>sound science, and
repeatable studies?</i>

1720
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:09,783
<i>What impact will that
have on ourselves,</i>

1721
01:25:09,785 --> 01:25:11,551
<i>our planet,</i>

1722
01:25:11,553 --> 01:25:12,985
<i>and our future?</i>

1723
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:45,084
A quote in "The New Yorker" said,

1724
01:25:45,086 --> 01:25:46,317
"Don't listen to Jeffrey Smith.

1725
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:48,387
He's a ballroom dance teacher."

1726
01:25:48,389 --> 01:25:50,890
Actually, I'm a swing dancer, thank you.

1727
01:25:52,527 --> 01:25:55,793
Well, my wife always tells me
that I'm incredibly unpersuasive

1728
01:25:55,795 --> 01:25:58,731
because I'm always
punching people in the face

1729
01:25:58,733 --> 01:26:00,433
with how wrong they are and, you know,

1730
01:26:00,435 --> 01:26:02,567
how my facts are the right facts and so on.

1731
01:26:02,569 --> 01:26:04,404
And she keeps saying I used to do this

1732
01:26:04,406 --> 01:26:06,138
when I was on the anti side
of the argument as well,

1733
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:07,906
so she said, "You're just
doing the same thing now.

1734
01:26:07,908 --> 01:26:09,375
"You're just telling everyone they're wrong

1735
01:26:09,377 --> 01:26:10,744
"and shouting in people's faces.

1736
01:26:10,746 --> 01:26:12,410
"You just changed your mind completely.

1737
01:26:12,412 --> 01:26:13,678
Why do you expect anyone to believe that?"

1738
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,082
And she's probably got a point.

1739
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:27,627
<i>More than 100 Nobel laureates

1740

1746
01:26:42,912 --> 01:26:44,244
- <i>Uh...</i>
- <i>You know, the good thing</i>

1747
01:26:44,246 --> 01:26:45,578

<i>Right now, we're being
replaced by social interaction.</i>

<i>Virtual reality

1758
01:27:07,669 --> 01:27:08,866

1762

<i>Oh, man, the future.</i>

1767
01:27:23,051 --> 01:27:25,084
You know, when people
talk about doom and gloom,

we're gonna have so many people

1770
01:27:29,256 --> 01:27:30,623
'cause we'd have so many
people, that's baloney.

1771
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:32,660
First of all, if we all had a party,

1772
01:27:32,662 --> 01:27:34,494
all of the people in the world had a party,

1773
01:27:34,496 --> 01:27:36,529
we would fit on the island of Hawaii.

1774
01:27:36,531 --> 01:27:39,132
All of the people in the world
right now if we had a party.

1775
01:27:42,569 --> 01:27:44,538
<i>39 more U.S. presidents

1777
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:48,775
<i>A year later, a revolution happens,</i>

1778

1779
01:27:50,845 --> 01:27:52,945
<i>Some people believe
that an organic farmer</i>

1780
01:27:52,947 --> 01:27:55,749
<i>and a geneticist

01:27:55,751 --> 01:27:58,283
<i>of the agricultural spectrum.</i>

1782
01:27:58,285 --> 01:27:59,551
<i>But that's not true,</i>

1783
01:27:59,553 --> 01:28:01,722
and we both have the same goal,

1784
01:28:01,724 --> 01:28:04,890
which is an ecologically based agriculture.

1785
01:28:04,892 --> 01:28:07,561
<i>We met at another farm.</i>

1799
01:28:37,491 --> 01:28:39,560
<i>But that's the whole point.</i>

1800
01:28:39,562 --> 01:28:42,427
<i>You're presenting it as a doctor.</i>
