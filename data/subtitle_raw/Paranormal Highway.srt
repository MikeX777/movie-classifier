00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:32,856
Is it on?

3
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:36,687
Yeah, this red light
here means it's on.

4
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:41,243
Today
is October 14, 2011,

5
00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:42,281
uh, 3:21 p.m.

6
00:00:44,214 --> 00:00:46,939
My name is Detective Jack
Scott, this is my partner

7
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:51,288
Kim Martin of the Leon
County Sheriff's Department.

8
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,256
We were assigned to
investigate the Debate Bus

9
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:57,259
Incident near
Moccasin Gap, Florida.

10
00:00:57,261 --> 00:00:58,884
Case number DTI-875.

11
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:03,024
We've been reviewing the video
footage that was retrieved

12
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:06,061
from the site, as well
as forensic reports

13
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:09,513
and other investigation
data so far received.

14
00:01:09,515 --> 00:01:11,860
We're making these video
reports because we have

15
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:16,796
now become concerned our
investigation may be compromised.

16
00:01:16,798 --> 00:01:20,351
We feel that this event
must not be suppressed.

17
00:01:20,353 --> 00:01:22,906
The public needs to
know what happened

18
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:25,770
'cause it may happen again.

19
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:30,361
And we'll send this video file
and all other documentation

20
00:01:30,363 --> 00:01:33,537
to the appropriate party
when we feel it's necessary.

21
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:36,920
Other video reports
will follow as needed.

22
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:18,409
What the...

23
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:19,963
What the heck did you hit?

24
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:20,964
We just hit.

25
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:22,379
Are you all right?

26
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:23,656
What did we hit?

27
00:02:23,658 --> 00:02:26,038
Everybody just stay
down, stay in the bus.

28
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,418
Coach, come with me.

29
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:45,300
What'd you hit?

30
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:50,131
Kids get, get back, get back.

31
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:54,723
Don't get too close, you
don't know what's under there.

32
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,384
In case you haven't
been following the story,

33
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:04,766
the Key West debate
team bus has been found.

34
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,251
I repeat, the bus
has been found.

35
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,633
No word yet on the 11 students,

36
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:12,222
bus driver, or
documentary cameraman.

37
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:14,914
The Leon County Sheriff's
Department found the bus

38
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:19,229
this morning neat Moccasin
Gap here in northern Florida.

39
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:22,577
This is a largely unpopulated
area of the county.

40
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,200
The police aren't allowing
reporters near the bus,

41
00:03:25,202 --> 00:03:28,445
however, I see it about 50
yards or so down the road.

42
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:31,655
There appears to be a lot of
broken glass and other damage.

43
00:03:31,657 --> 00:03:34,140
On screen is a photo
released earlier

44
00:03:34,142 --> 00:03:35,762
from the Sheriff's Department.

45
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:38,662
The surrounding area is
considered a crime scene,

46
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:41,975
and here with me is
Sergeant James Monahan

47
00:03:41,977 --> 00:03:44,426
of the Leon County
Sheriff's Department.

48
00:03:44,428 --> 00:03:46,739
Officer Monahan,
what can you tell us?

49
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:48,982
Well it's still pretty
early to draw conclusions.

50
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:52,055
I see fire department
personnel in hazmat suits,

51
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:53,884
what can you tell us about that?

52
00:03:53,886 --> 00:03:55,782
Well there appears to
be some unknown chemical

53
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:58,613
on the bus' windows and
floor, the forensic team

54
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:00,580
is taking samples, we
should know more soon.

55
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:03,721
I understand there were
cameras discovered on the bus.

56
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:06,069
There were six video
cameras installed on the bus,

57
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:07,898
still functioning, we
understand they were

58
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,934
filming some sort
of documentary.

59
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:11,798
The video footage is being
analyzed, we're getting

60
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,421
excellent assistance
from the Florida State

61
00:04:13,423 --> 00:04:15,112
Highway Patrol in this process.

62
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:17,183
Any idea what's
on these cameras?

63
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:18,736
Not at this time.

64
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:21,808
Is there any evidence of the
students or other passengers?

65
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,639
No, we have officers
and dogs combing an area

66
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:27,090
within the 25-mile
radius of the bus.

67
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:30,093
Thank you Sergeant Monahan,
Officer James Monahan

68
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:32,164
of the Leon County
Sheriff's Department.

69
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,994
The students were traveling
to the National Collegiate

70
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:38,377
Debate Tournament in
Birmingham, Alabama.

71
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:41,483
I understand that the
tournament has been postponed.

72
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:46,490
We hope to know more soon, a
$25,000 reward has been posted.

I am Dr. Ronald O'Neil

95
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,890
are debate team coaches here
at Key West State College.

96
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:21,065
We are also professors in the
communications department.

97
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,033
For the past six years,
our teams have won

98
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:26,209
the state championships,
but never the nationals.

99
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:29,212
This is going to be our year.

100
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:31,904
Our program produces
mental acuity,

101
00:06:31,906 --> 00:06:33,492
discipline, and character.

102
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,804

that's how good they are.

104
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:40,395
About six months ago, Key
West College received a grant

105
00:06:40,397 --> 00:06:43,536
to produce a documentary of
our progress through the state

106
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:47,678
competitions and on to
the national championship.

107
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,922
A cameraman from Coral
Reef Productions has been

108
00:06:49,924 --> 00:06:52,027
traveling with us,
capturing all the events.

109
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:54,031
Oh, we are very excited.

110
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:04,385
Put your camera
down, Shane, I'm making

111
00:07:04,387 --> 00:07:07,733
my own documentary, and
I'm interviewing you.

112
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:09,907
Okay, whatever.

113
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:14,015
This is Shane Walker,
award winning documentarian,

114
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,982
and how many awards
have you won?

115
00:07:15,984 --> 00:07:18,226
Besides my Oscars
and my Emmies?

116
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:20,193
And why am I interviewing you?

117
00:07:20,195 --> 00:07:22,957
That's
a good question.

118
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:30,307
What the hell is this?

119
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:34,484
DJ Brown, DJ Brown Trucking
Company, the bus company.

120
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:36,313
You put cameras in this?

121
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:38,384
That's the
one you contracted.

122
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:40,766
This is not what
we contracted.

123
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:43,389
I know, I know but
she's a reliable bus,

124
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:44,839
she'll get us where we gotta go.

125
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,323
Isn't there
something else, this is...

126
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:47,566
Welcome aboard.

127
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,050
Ron, you're gonna
have to accept it,

128
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,328
come on honey, come on.

129
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,710
No, I can't get a
PO now, Shane look,

130
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:56,333
I don't need this filming now.

131
00:07:56,335 --> 00:07:57,817
No, what?

132
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,336
- Just doin' my job.
- It would take to,

133
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:02,374
yeah, yeah, I'm tryin'
to do my job too, Shane.

134
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:05,618
It would take two days to get
a PO, I can't wait that long.

135
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,827
- You, oh Sara...
- Ron, we have to

136
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:09,381
go with it, please honey.

137
00:08:09,383 --> 00:08:10,382
- Put it past us!
- All right,

138
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:12,038
I'll talk to you later, Sara.

139
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,420
We don't have a lot of
choice, we have to do it.

140
00:08:14,422 --> 00:08:15,973
Our Florida state champions

141
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:19,080
and soon to be
national champions!

142
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,325
Julie Jorgenson and Josh Martin!

143
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:25,086
His lovely wife Jaiden Martin,

and last but not least, our
alternate, Carlos Montoya.

149
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,523
- And Pepe.
- Hey, let's get on the bus!

150
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,662
Oh good there's...

151
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,494
This sucks.

152
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,637
Well, home sweet home.

153
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,226
Okay, Captain DJ Brown
here welcoming you all aboard

154
00:09:02,228 --> 00:09:05,609
flight 52 to Birmingham,
we're gonna be traveling at

155
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:09,026
50 miles an hour, about
10 feet above sea level,

156
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:12,409
and oh by the way, we can't
go any less than 50 miles

157
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:15,412
an hour 'cause there's a bomb
on board and it'll explode.

158
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:19,934
All right now, listen up,
we do have some strict

159
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:22,488
safety policies on
board this flight.

160
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,180
You can get up and move
around all you want,

161
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:28,908
but don't use the bathroom
at the back of the bus,

162
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,290
'cause we ain't got one.

163
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:34,155
Oh, oh and one more
thing, as you can see

164
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:38,055
we got this nice stereo
system, all decked out,

165
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:40,092
did this just for you
folks, but there's one rule

166
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:45,030
on this bus, when I play the
music, I choose the music too.

167
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:48,652
We know
what we're gonna be

168
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:49,895
- listening to.
- That's not music.

169
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:51,586
What're we
gonna be listening to?

170
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:59,007
It's a little
bit boring, but you know.

171
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:00,388
Does he like that?

172
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,596
- Shane!

Yeah, but check

Yes, but I own

no bumpy, that's the rule.

00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:24,290
I'm Professor Emily O'Neil, I
work at Key West State College

216
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,292
and I have been the debate coach

217
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:29,364
with my husband for nine years.

218
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:32,126
The team that we have
today is exceptional,

219
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:34,646
they're very unique,
and they are at a level

220
00:12:34,648 --> 00:12:37,512
that they're gonna
go all the way.

221
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:41,514
The motto that we have that
the students came up with

222
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:45,449
is focused, motivated,
and prepared, so FMP.

223
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:48,660
And they're all saying
it on the bus, FMP,

224
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:52,595
focus, motivated, prepared,
they're ready to go.

238
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:53,103
AC, what's goin' down?

00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:56,589
It's cool, my grandma
was rushed to the hospital.

be all right but

00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:08,532
don't they always
say that though?

245
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:10,189
I seen combat soldiers
on their last leg,

246
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:12,364

Back in PR we was all
mixed up, Puerto Cubicans,

251
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:29,003
Puerto Coricans, and we
moved to Miami, downtown.

252
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:33,281
Got my GI bill of rights
after two tours in Iraq.

253

October 15th, 1:15 p.m.

292
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:08,781
The kind of damage this
bus sustained, along with

293
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:11,646
the slime residue deposited,
amongst other things are,

294
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:15,167
to say the least, very
difficult to evaluate.

295
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:17,514
They are so far unprecedented.

296
00:17:17,516 --> 00:17:20,138
We have received a chemical
analysis of the white

297
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,244
substance found on the
bus, this substance,

298
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:25,591
which we are calling
slime, has so far shown

299
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:26,938
no chemical properties

00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,872

It also does not seem to
react to certain stimuli,

302
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:37,431

00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:06,460
I'm Carlos Montoya,
and I'm the alternate.

308
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:08,082
Which means, I
don't debate often,

309
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:11,396

or, and if I don't debate,

if I don't get awards,

311
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,607
I don't go to law school.

312
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:18,299

I don't become a law partner.

00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:34,481
All right so, Gail Stevens, I
was born in Mobile, Alabama,

337
00:19:35,585 --> 00:19:37,033
moved to Lander,
Wyoming when I was 13.

338
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:41,348
My parents own a horse ranch
there and I love rodeo,

339

even more than
debate, it's a close

340
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:44,972
second though, so don't worry.

341
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:46,801

00:19:46,803 --> 00:19:48,769

record for barrel racing

343
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,911
and I owe it all to my horse,
Duke, he gets all the credit.

344
00:19:52,913 --> 00:19:57,918
And I named him after well,
you know, The Duke, duh.

345
00:19:59,471 --> 00:20:01,816
This year's national championship,
Birmingham, Alabama.

346
00:20:01,818 --> 00:20:04,129
I owe it all to
Coach Ron and Emily,

347
00:20:04,131 --> 00:20:05,993
they are absolutely the best.

348
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:09,376
It's 21-21, nine minutes
left in the third quarter.

349
00:20:09,378 --> 00:20:10,618
So it's still...

350
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,002
Hey, remember
your blood sugar.

351
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:15,830
I was just
reinforcing, you know the stuff

352
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:17,246
we already knew
about the bull there.

353
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:18,971
- A big chunk out of that...
- Yes, she did.

354
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:13,405
Oh, Carlos, I oughta
lasso you up and feed you

355
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:14,855
to the bulls, give
me back my chips!

356
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,375
She loves me,
she truly loves me!

357
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:18,859
- Oh my goodness.
- I knew it, I knew it!

358
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,518
Somebody get Pepe.

00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:22,267
Who in the hell
left the door open?

378
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:25,028
I closed the door,
now it's open.

379
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,652
- Who left the radio on?
- I didn't do it.

380
00:22:27,654 --> 00:22:30,896
All this stuff on the
bus, the door was wide open!

381
00:22:30,898 --> 00:22:32,174
Damn, Carlos.

382
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:33,382
- Maybe you left the door open
- Where's my...

383
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:35,349
What's goin' on, what's up?

384
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:37,593
Carlos,

385
00:22:37,595 --> 00:22:40,389
- Carlos, did you do this?
- Wow.

386
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:41,355
Well Carlos
thank you for nothing.

387
00:22:41,357 --> 00:22:42,391
I did not!

388
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:43,771
What is goin' on though?

389
00:22:43,773 --> 00:22:44,841
- What?
- Seriously, Carlos?

390
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:46,188
- Carlos!
- I didn't do nothing!

391
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,154
- Wait...
- That's not cool!

392
00:22:47,156 --> 00:22:48,707
I didn't do nothing!

393
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:49,915
Look guys,
just give him a break.

394
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:51,262
You
didn't do anything.

395
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:54,679
Carlos, we're
not gonna take this

396
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:57,233
for the next two days while
we're going up and back

397
00:22:57,235 --> 00:22:59,408
- from Alabama.
- It wasn't me, it wasn't me!

398
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,962
- I wasn't even here.
- Yeah, very funny, man.

399
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,446
- Give it a rest, Carlos.
- Guys I'm serious,

400
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,621
- it wasn't me.
- It's not funny.

401
00:23:11,284 --> 00:23:12,731
You're
shooting some things right now.

402
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:17,462
Oh
he's just shooting that.

403
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:31,060
Jeez, what's going
on, someone touched my hair!

404
00:23:31,062 --> 00:23:33,580
- It's just a dream.
- calm down,

405
00:23:33,582 --> 00:23:34,995
you scared the life out
of me, what's wrong?

406
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,618
No, I know the difference!

407
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,413
- No one was there!
- It wasn't a dream!

408
00:23:39,415 --> 00:23:43,383
There's nobody here,
nobody was behind you.

409
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:44,248
No.

410
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,147
- You're fine, I promise.
- It's all right, Julie.

411
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:53,151
I promise.

412
00:23:53,153 --> 00:23:55,466
Oh jeez, where do I begin?

413
00:23:56,639 --> 00:24:00,227
Well, I always loved
school, loved competing.

414
00:24:00,229 --> 00:24:02,919
I was honored just to be
considered for team captain,

415
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:07,821
and student body pres,
oh, I'm Miss Congeniality.

416
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:11,790
Until victory is on the line,
then as Coach Emily says,

417
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:13,827
time for the
daggers to come out.

418
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:16,933
Earned a scholarship to
Key West from Minnesota.

419
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:19,697
Are you kidding
me, yay sunshine!

420
00:24:21,181 --> 00:24:25,287
And now wow, we're the one's
making the Ivy League shake.

421
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:26,738
Go Raptors, whoo!

422
00:24:35,471 --> 00:24:37,644
Man we just hit somethin'.

423
00:24:37,646 --> 00:24:39,475
What happened?

424
00:24:44,342 --> 00:24:45,962
- What is that?
- No, don't touch it!

425
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:50,208
My hand,...

426
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,488
Come on, let's get back
on the bus, you okay?

427
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,077
- What was that?
- Wow, oh, hold on, hey!

428
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,735
Let me take a look at this,
I'm pre-med, I'm pre-med.

429
00:24:59,737 --> 00:25:01,046
You look like
about the kind of doctor

430
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:01,978
- I'd get!
- Take a seat, take a seat,

431
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,981
take a seat!

432
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:06,397
All right, I'm just gonna
clean out this cut, okay?

433
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:08,019
With just a little
bit of antiseptic.

434
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:11,093
Oh my god, you'll
be okay, all right.

435
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:14,646
Yeah, easy, easy,

436
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:16,648
it's okay, all right.

437
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,377
Hold that right
there, okay good.

438
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:21,929
Are you all right?

439
00:25:21,931 --> 00:25:23,448
- He'll be fine he'll be fine.
- Oh my god.

440
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,105
- What's going on?
- Don't worry.

441
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,865
Oh my god,
that looks really bad.

442
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:28,971
Oh god, okay, what happened,

443
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:30,421
- what happened?
- Just stop the bleeding,

444
00:25:30,423 --> 00:25:32,768
- will ya?
- All right, I will, I will.

445
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,701
Okay, all right now.

446
00:25:34,703 --> 00:25:36,185
- What happened?
- Let me take this off.

447
00:25:36,187 --> 00:25:37,635
Uh, somethin' got
him I don't know what it was.

448
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:39,602
All right, hold that right
there, I'm gonna bandage

449
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,845
- this up, okay?
- There's some nasty stuff

450
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:42,433
- on the front of the bus too.
- Yeah...

451
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:44,573
- What kind of stuff?
- Uh, eh, I don't know,

452
00:25:44,575 --> 00:25:46,264
some type of slimy
ooze or something.

453
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:48,335
- Eww...
- It's like we hit something,

454
00:25:48,337 --> 00:25:50,786
- uh like...
- Um, um gosh, hurry Devon!

455
00:25:50,788 --> 00:25:51,787
We need some
Band-Aids, yeah...

456
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:54,099
- Oh do you?
- Oh yeah...

457
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:10,357
Oh I don't know
what I'm doing here!

458
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:15,466
- Stop yelling!
- I just can't stand this!

459
00:26:31,932 --> 00:26:35,037
I'm Connor Wagner, I am
the track star of the school,

460
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,970
and the debate star.

461
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:41,457
At Key West we have three
sports, we have track,

462
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:42,909
track, and track.

463
00:26:44,358 --> 00:26:46,844
So, naturally, I chose debate.

464
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,639
And track.

465
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:51,709
You know I guess debate's
sort of like a sport anyways,

466
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:55,887
I mean, we compete, we
work out, and we win meets,

467
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,371
you know, that's what we do.

468
00:26:59,373 --> 00:27:01,443
That's why y'all are
here, 'cause we're about

469
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:04,238
to go to Nationals and
we're about to win.

470
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,723
That's all we do is win.

471
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,483
I mean me and AC we were
already talking about how

472
00:27:07,485 --> 00:27:10,348
we were gonna take down
National's me and her.

473
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:14,594
So I mean, that's the whole

about
dinner, and a polar bear,

489
00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:40,058
in the snow,
what does that signify?

490
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,232
- Come on!
- It's important to enforce

491
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:42,544
the good on the regency.

492
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:46,651
Excellent, let's try
some more, over on this side.

493
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:47,652
- Quick!
- The world's gonna go around

494
00:28:47,654 --> 00:28:48,895
without polar bears,

495
00:28:48,897 --> 00:28:50,413
- so what's the point?
- There's more than one

496
00:28:50,415 --> 00:28:52,105
polar bear species,
not important.

497
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:53,831
- Okay...
- Yeah but...

498
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:57,317
Hey you guys, hang
on just a moment.

499
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,112
Hey guys.

500
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,700
Oh my god, coach!

501
00:29:03,394 --> 00:29:06,257
The Heritage Park
Inn is 45 minutes away.

502
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:08,397
RR and R, Poppa John's Pizza!

503
00:29:10,677 --> 00:29:12,953
Right on!

504
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,654
Hey we're here!

505
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:35,493
Um yeah, we'll take 'em.

506
00:29:35,495 --> 00:29:37,046
Yeah we'll take 'em.

507
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:45,367
Hey, let me give you your key.

508
00:29:46,748 --> 00:29:48,092
- Aw!
- He's a hotel cat,

509
00:29:48,094 --> 00:29:51,060
we found him as a stray,
and then he just stayed.

510
00:29:51,062 --> 00:29:53,097
Took care of him
from here on in.

511
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:01,383
Here we go.

512
00:30:05,732 --> 00:30:07,767
I'm
the bathroom!

513
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:09,458

We have found, Ron and
Emily's favorite song

00:33:23,274 --> 00:33:24,549
- from their high school years.
- Oh...

563
00:33:24,551 --> 00:33:25,792
- Oh!
- Whoo!

564
00:33:25,794 --> 00:33:26,862
Hope the vinyl
wasn't!

565
00:33:26,864 --> 00:33:28,519
Oh shush up!

566
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:30,624
Now we invite you two to
dance just like you did

567
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:32,005
during your senior prom,

568
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:32,972
- Hey.
- when you fell in love.

569
00:33:32,974 --> 00:33:34,076
Come on!

570
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:34,870
You guys thank you

571
00:33:34,872 --> 00:33:36,391
for the nice gift!

572
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:39,185
- All right!
- Yeah!

573
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:55,580

574
00:34:02,382 --> 00:34:04,210
You guys mean so much to us!

575
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:06,212
So, I know we've
worked hard and,

576
00:34:06,214 --> 00:34:09,077
this has been a long,
long grueling road

577
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:10,699
but we're almost there.

578
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:14,220
It was a nice ,

579
00:34:14,222 --> 00:34:16,394
the song and the nice
gift and everything,

580
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:18,431
it was so nice.

581
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:22,297
Now, I think it's
prudent for us to retire.

582
00:34:22,299 --> 00:34:23,781
- Oh whoo...
- Long day ahead.

583
00:34:23,783 --> 00:34:26,818
That's right, big
day tomorrow, hmm,

584
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,959
onto the championships!

585
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:31,478
Let's do it!

586
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,931
This looks
like you're having fun.

587
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:38,002
Baby, wake up.

588
00:34:38,004 --> 00:34:39,831
You listening?

589
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:41,557
Not really, I'm sleeping.

590
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,663
I have something to tell you,

591
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,047
are you happy you married me?

592
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:49,360
Yeah, life's perfect.

593
00:34:50,499 --> 00:34:52,948
- You're great.
- Well what if things

594
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,916
were more perfect?

595
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:57,677
Oh uh, perfect is perfect.

596
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,473
Yeah but what if there
was something more?

597
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:02,028
Uh, more of what?

598
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:05,963
Well, one plus
one equals three.

599
00:35:08,414 --> 00:35:10,071
I'm having our baby.

600
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:16,972
Did you hear me?

601
00:35:16,974 --> 00:35:18,044
I'm pregnant.

602
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,252
You're
having our baby?

603
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:22,946
Yeah I'm pregnant.

604
00:35:28,434 --> 00:35:30,537
Hi my name's Josh Martin.

605
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:32,539
A little bit about
me, I grew up on the

606
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:35,266
west side of Los
Angles my entire life.

607
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:37,751
My father is an
investment banker,

608
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:39,615
and very successful.

609
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:41,790
A little bit of him
rubbed off on me I guess,

610
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:45,623
I'm pragmatic, centered
and serious I suppose.

611
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:48,659
The only impulsive thing
that I've ever done

612
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:51,973
in my entire life
was to marry Jaiden,

613
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:54,389
but they say that love is
blind but I went into it

614
00:35:54,391 --> 00:35:57,150
with my eyes just,
just wide open,

615
00:35:57,152 --> 00:36:00,638
which was the best
investment I ever made.

616
00:36:01,846 --> 00:36:04,813
About our trip here, we
just can't wait to get,

617
00:36:04,815 --> 00:36:09,233
to get this debate championship
off, to a good start.

618
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:11,923
Wow.

619
00:36:11,925 --> 00:36:13,686
That's awesome, babe.

620
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:16,894
Aw that's awesome!

621
00:36:16,896 --> 00:36:18,447
Congratulations you guys.

622
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:19,276

00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:20,587
Thanks man.

624
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:23,176
Oh, we're having
a baby.

625
00:36:23,178 --> 00:36:26,009
Oh my goodness,

626
00:36:28,873 --> 00:36:31,322
Well um, a little
bit about me,

627
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:34,049
my name is Jaiden Martin.

628
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:36,534
My father, he was a
diplomat to Brazil,

629
00:36:36,536 --> 00:36:38,469
Japan and South Africa.

630
00:36:39,436 --> 00:36:41,470
Um, I speak Japanese the best,

631
00:36:41,472 --> 00:36:44,163
I absolutely love
it it's so fun!

632
00:36:44,165 --> 00:36:48,132
Um, I got to travel a lot
before I came to Key West.

633
00:36:48,134 --> 00:36:51,377
I wanted to join their
elite debate team.

634
00:36:51,379 --> 00:36:55,036
The greatest thing
was meeting Josh.

635
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:59,557
I love him so much, it just
keeps getting better and better.

636
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:01,525
Wow, it's
been about a year,

637
00:37:01,527 --> 00:37:04,252
and I never thought I would
meet someone like him.

638
00:37:04,254 --> 00:37:07,050
And I'm must so
happy that I did.

639
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:10,430
Hey everybody!

640
00:37:10,432 --> 00:37:12,018

Come close!

- What's going on?
- What's going on?

643
00:37:15,437 --> 00:37:18,268
Uh, my dear wife,
has just told me,

644
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:23,547
the best news since the
creation of the universe!

645
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:25,411
What?

646
00:37:25,413 --> 00:37:26,412
We're gonna have a baby!

647
00:37:29,002 --> 00:37:30,140

667
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:37,655

00:38:47,115 --> 00:38:48,218

676
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:06,408
- Thank you sir.
- You're welcome.

677
00:39:18,871 --> 00:39:21,045
I couldn't sleep at all.

678
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:28,258
Devon look, I
forgive you, but don't

679
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,605
ever let it happen
again, all right?

680
00:39:30,607 --> 00:39:32,089
Scout's honor.

681
00:39:34,266 --> 00:39:36,990
My name is Devon Rogers.

682
00:39:36,992 --> 00:39:38,475
A little bit of
background on myself.

683
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:40,477
I grew up in the Windy City.

684
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,686
My father is a
biological engineer,

685
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:44,860
and my mother is
an endocrinologist.

686
00:39:44,862 --> 00:39:46,862
Um, I was home schooled
most of my life,

687
00:39:46,864 --> 00:39:49,210
and then I got into college
when I was 14 year old,

688
00:39:49,212 --> 00:39:52,040
where now I'm a pre-med
major in my junior year.

689
00:39:52,042 --> 00:39:55,043
So I'm 17 years old, I'm kind
of the baby of the group,

690
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:59,220
you know, some people kind
of like to kid with me,

691
00:39:59,222 --> 00:40:01,083
I'm like the child
genius as they

692
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:02,913
call me sometimes, but,
you know, you know,

693
00:40:02,915 --> 00:40:04,673
I just works out that way.

694
00:40:04,675 --> 00:40:07,814
Um, yeah I can't really
take all the credit for

695
00:40:07,816 --> 00:40:10,265
my ability, you know,
heredity did have

696
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:12,094
a good part to play in it.

697
00:40:12,096 --> 00:40:15,097
Um, I'd definitely say
I'm a good debater.

698
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:16,444
I'm probably the most
rational of the group,

699
00:40:16,446 --> 00:40:18,963
I can definitely
articulate very well.

700
00:40:18,965 --> 00:40:22,383
Uh, when I do debate,
I like to conclude,

701
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:25,729
I really like to have
my facts straight,

702
00:40:25,731 --> 00:40:27,972
I like to study, I really
like to have it ready,

703
00:40:27,974 --> 00:40:29,388
'cause when I do go in
I want to be able to

704
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,286
go in for the kill.

705
00:40:31,288 --> 00:40:33,875
I do love debating and
I really want us to,

706
00:40:33,877 --> 00:40:35,670
you know get this win,
'cause it definitely

707
00:40:35,672 --> 00:40:40,504
would look good on the, you
know the resume one day, so...

708
00:40:42,782 --> 00:40:45,093
Damn, it's the alternator.

709
00:40:45,095 --> 00:40:47,302
I just replaced that thing too.

710
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:49,753
The competition starts
tomorrow at 10 a.m.!

711
00:40:49,755 --> 00:40:52,376
I know coach, I got, ,
parts store's looking,

712
00:40:52,378 --> 00:40:53,653
hold on, hold on.

713
00:40:53,655 --> 00:40:57,243
You know sometimes
parts for these old,

714
00:40:57,245 --> 00:40:59,210
the engine's bus is
like Thelma, here,

715
00:40:59,212 --> 00:41:01,351
could be a might
touch hard to find.

716
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:03,249
Yeah, yeah I'm here.

717
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:04,595
You got it?

718
00:41:04,597 --> 00:41:07,426
W-Well good, well
get on out here!

719
00:41:07,428 --> 00:41:09,807
Thanks darling, you
made me happier than

720
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:12,051
a tornado in a trailer park!

721
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,296
Okay, yep, bye!

722
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,055
All right, 60 minutes, tops.

723
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,609
All right.

724
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:20,853
Okay you guys we're
broken down, one more time,

725
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:23,096
let's do rapid fires,
one more time before

726
00:41:23,098 --> 00:41:24,339
we get on the bus, okay?

727
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:26,548
Here's the last one
of the nine statements

728
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,378
that at the National
Competition, if you

729
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,484
don't know which one your
gonna get for your team.

730
00:41:31,486 --> 00:41:34,107
Resolve, the US government
should enact regulation

731
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:36,040
to preserve the
climate and habitat of

732
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:38,284
all polar bears and
enact prohibitions

733
00:41:38,286 --> 00:41:41,218
against human encroachment
into their domain.

734
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,875
Now start with the con,

735
00:41:42,877 --> 00:41:44,186
- Oh!
- Josh!

736
00:41:44,188 --> 00:41:46,361
In 2009, the PBSE
reports that of the

737
00:41:46,363 --> 00:41:48,329
19 sub-population of polar bear,

738
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:49,640
eight were declining,
three were stable,

739
00:41:49,642 --> 00:41:51,815
and one was actually increasing.

740
00:41:51,817 --> 00:41:53,506
Can't say what's happening
to the remaining seven,

741
00:41:53,508 --> 00:41:55,197
so the data on the 25,000,

742
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,268
- Wait, wait wait wait wait!
- or the 25,000 polar bears

743
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,305
- is inconclusive.
- Slow,.

744
00:41:59,307 --> 00:42:00,513
- Ready coach.
- Ready go!

745
00:42:00,515 --> 00:42:02,273
Okay, we know that
extent,

746
00:42:02,275 --> 00:42:04,275
this forces these bears,
the only bears who don't

747
00:42:04,277 --> 00:42:06,485
truly hibernate, to
seek more land bases,

748
00:42:06,487 --> 00:42:08,210
and come into
contact with humans.

749
00:42:08,212 --> 00:42:10,696
Food hunting, home
protecting mammals,

750
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:12,353
the only mammals with guns.

751
00:42:12,355 --> 00:42:14,389
Okay, let's not go
to the guns right now.

752
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:17,047
Let's just stick with the
facts with the polar bears.

753
00:42:17,049 --> 00:42:18,082
- Okay.
- Got that?

754
00:42:18,084 --> 00:42:19,290
- Yes.
- Okay, team member

755
00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:21,672
will pick up, the guns,
when her, her part,

756
00:42:21,674 --> 00:42:23,018
- All right.
- at the second part, okay?

757
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,572
- Okay.
- Excellent, good guys,

758
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:26,125
- excellent.
- Hey how's it going?

759
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,022
Having a little problem here?

760
00:42:27,024 --> 00:42:28,161
Yeah you might say.

761
00:42:28,163 --> 00:42:29,266
I cut my hand.

762
00:42:29,268 --> 00:42:30,992
Yeah, there's salt and...

763
00:42:30,994 --> 00:42:35,410
What the hell?

764
00:42:35,412 --> 00:42:39,414
That alternator was fried,
that shouldn't be running!

765
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:42,175
Carlos, you in there
messing up the cab?

766
00:42:42,177 --> 00:42:43,970
- Watch them.
- That was dirty.

767
00:42:43,972 --> 00:42:47,318
Let's get going DJ,
let's get going DJ.

768
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,699
You still want

769
00:42:48,701 --> 00:42:50,252
- the part, or not?
- Time is of the essence!

770
00:42:50,254 --> 00:42:51,392
Yeah, uh, just throw it in
the back for me.

771
00:42:51,394 --> 00:42:52,703
- Sure.
- Thank you.

772
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:54,569
You're welcome.

773
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:58,985
Well round 'em up
coach, round 'em up!

774
00:42:58,987 --> 00:43:01,471
Let's go folks, be
careful on the road!

775
00:43:03,336 --> 00:43:06,579
Detective Martin.

776
00:43:06,581 --> 00:43:09,410
Kim is en route
from the hospital.

777
00:43:09,412 --> 00:43:11,550
We found out her sister
and family's motor home

778
00:43:11,552 --> 00:43:14,345
was attacked and damaged.

779
00:43:14,347 --> 00:43:17,383
Slime deposits were
found on the scene.

780
00:43:17,385 --> 00:43:19,281
This occurred just
three miles west of

781
00:43:19,283 --> 00:43:21,801
the Moccasin Gap Incident.

782
00:43:21,803 --> 00:43:24,908
Kim's sister, brother-in-law
and one child,

783
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,013
are currently missing.

784
00:43:27,015 --> 00:43:27,844
Another...

785
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,435
Another child, a five year old,

786
00:43:33,953 --> 00:43:37,368
was found unconscious
about a mile from the site.

787
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,854
And she is currently in
Tallahassee General Hospital,

788
00:43:39,856 --> 00:43:41,271
suffering a coma.

789
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:44,377
She may not make it.

790
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,899
- Hey.
- Hey.

791
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:52,832
How's your niece?

792
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:54,247
Touch and go.

793
00:43:54,249 --> 00:43:55,594
Jack, What the hell

794
00:43:55,596 --> 00:43:56,802
- is going on here?
- Get over here, come here.

795
00:43:56,804 --> 00:43:57,598
Come here.

796
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,464
It's gonna be okay.

797
00:44:03,051 --> 00:44:05,673
Hey look I have been
working most of the night.

798
00:44:05,675 --> 00:44:07,778
Okay, come here,
let me show you.

799
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,609
I have found out some
more information on these

800
00:44:10,611 --> 00:44:13,232
invisible creatures, I've
been calling them entities.

801
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,647
- Okay.
- All right now what

802
00:44:14,649 --> 00:44:17,823
I've discovered, is that
there were a variety of events

803
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:20,377
that all occurred on the
morning of October 11th.

804
00:44:20,379 --> 00:44:22,137
Now these events, every
one of them seemed to all

805
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:25,313
just center around the
debate bus location and,

806
00:44:25,315 --> 00:44:29,075
and branch out into
multiple directions.

807
00:44:29,077 --> 00:44:31,353
Now here, let me pull it up.

808
00:44:31,355 --> 00:44:34,771
Uh, there, okay, on
this CNN news report,

809
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:36,773
a downed aircraft was
found about six miles

810
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:38,878
from the bus sighting,
you can clearly see

811
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,363
slime here on the
front of the plane.

812
00:44:41,365 --> 00:44:43,089
The highway patrol also
found a destroyed home

813
00:44:43,091 --> 00:44:47,093
not far away from this, with
slime deposits all over it.

814
00:44:47,095 --> 00:44:48,612
Yeah, there's
definitely a pattern here.

815
00:44:48,614 --> 00:44:49,786
There's obviously a

816
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:50,856
pattern, we just
need to find out what

817
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:51,926
that pattern is though.

818
00:44:51,928 --> 00:44:53,446
Most definitely.

819
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:56,657
Detective Martin.

820
00:44:58,072 --> 00:44:58,900
Yes, okay.

821
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:04,283
See you in a minute.

822
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:05,871
- What was that?
- Hmm guess.

823
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:06,975
- Hmph.
- The Sheriff.

824
00:45:06,977 --> 00:45:08,874
- Uh-hmm.
- He wants to talk.

825
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:12,222
Yeah I
bet he wants to talk.

826
00:45:12,224 --> 00:45:13,672
All right, fine, you know
what, we're just gonna

827
00:45:13,674 --> 00:45:17,434
keep the camera rolling,
this should be interesting.

828
00:45:17,436 --> 00:45:18,884
Get it on tape that
he's gonna come in here

829
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:21,542
and tell us we can't do
this anymore, you watch.

830
00:45:21,544 --> 00:45:23,854
Exactly what we
thought this whole time.

831
00:45:23,856 --> 00:45:25,546
They know it there's no
way the federal government's

832
00:45:25,548 --> 00:45:26,995
gonna keep their
noses out of this,

833
00:45:26,997 --> 00:45:27,893
oh, there he is.

834
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:28,723
All right.

835
00:45:30,553 --> 00:45:31,795
- Sheriff.
- Jack.

836
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,555
- How are ya?
- Great how are you?

837
00:45:34,557 --> 00:45:36,177
Good, good, good.

838
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:39,076
I am, I am very sorry
about your sister,

839
00:45:39,078 --> 00:45:40,561
and your family.

840
00:45:40,563 --> 00:45:42,390
If there's anything I can
help you with any way...

841
00:45:42,392 --> 00:45:43,771
- I appreciate that.
- You're welcome.

842
00:45:43,773 --> 00:45:46,014
How's the investigation coming?

843
00:45:46,016 --> 00:45:48,189
Nothing concrete.

844
00:45:48,191 --> 00:45:52,503
In all my years this
is the damndest thing.

845
00:45:52,505 --> 00:45:54,678
You needn't be
concerned anymore.

846
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,853
You're off the case.

847
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:58,268
The state police and FBI...

848
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:00,822
Aw,
, the FBI?

849
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:01,996
- Of course.
- And we've been on top of

850
00:46:01,998 --> 00:46:03,825
this from the start, Sheriff,

851
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:05,862
and we are making progress!

852
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:07,139
- Well...
- This has become

853
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:08,416
- so personal to me.
- Her niece is in

854
00:46:08,418 --> 00:46:10,625
- the hospital!
- Calm down detective please,

855
00:46:10,627 --> 00:46:11,626
calm down!

856
00:46:11,628 --> 00:46:12,869
The reason to be

857
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:15,181
separated, you're too
personal, too involved!

858
00:46:15,183 --> 00:46:16,873
Of course we're,
it's personal!

859
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,981
When told to back
off, we back off.

860
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:24,881
- I'm sorry.
- Fine!

861
00:46:24,883 --> 00:46:26,229
Fine, fine fine.

862
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:28,609

Yeah, you're sorry, yeah.

868
00:46:41,762 --> 00:46:42,968
What the hell, tomorrow?

869
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,728

00:46:51,944 --> 00:46:53,806
I promise you that.

874
00:46:53,808 --> 00:46:55,325
We just need to be
damn sure we keep

00:46:55,327 --> 00:46:59,294
a backup of everything,
every one of those files!

876
00:46:59,296 --> 00:47:01,434
Okay, all right.

877
00:47:01,436 --> 00:47:02,953

878
00:47:02,955 --> 00:47:05,130

884
00:47:29,602 --> 00:47:33,604
Nearest gas.

885
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:37,818
Wouldn't
it be ironic...

886
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:50,207
Shane come on

887
00:47:50,209 --> 00:47:51,761
Uh I'm
not just filming,

888
00:47:51,763 --> 00:47:55,109
I'm immortalizing history here.

889
00:47:55,111 --> 00:47:58,319
You have the Hindenburg,
first walk on the moon,

890
00:47:58,321 --> 00:48:00,701
all those people are dead.

891
00:48:00,703 --> 00:48:03,980
All we got left is
film it never dies.

892
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:06,430
But for you I'll, I'll
give it a rest this time.

893
00:48:06,432 --> 00:48:07,261
Thanks.

894
00:48:09,746 --> 00:48:11,090
Madison!

895
00:48:11,092 --> 00:48:13,127
- You awake?
- Yeah.

896
00:48:13,129 --> 00:48:17,303
Who can sleep in these,
whatever this is.

897
00:48:17,305 --> 00:48:18,132
Yeah.

898
00:48:18,134 --> 00:48:20,203
You feeling okay?

899
00:48:20,205 --> 00:48:22,136
It's tough to control
blood sugar on trips,

900
00:48:22,138 --> 00:48:24,207
but thanks for asking.

901
00:48:24,209 --> 00:48:28,832

903
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,630
No problem.

904
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:35,390
We should hang
out, when we go back.

905
00:48:35,392 --> 00:48:37,496
We should, at a bar?

906
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:41,500
Um, I was thinking of
church group.

907
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,916
It's not really my thing but,

908
00:48:43,918 --> 00:48:46,574
for you, for a good friend yeah.

909
00:48:46,576 --> 00:48:48,438
Sounds like fun.

910
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,716
And uh, I'll keep
watching an eye on you,

911
00:48:50,718 --> 00:48:52,925

00:48:52,927 --> 00:48:55,065
if you're feeling bad
I can check you out.

913
00:48:55,067 --> 00:48:56,411
Oh good.

914
00:48:56,413 --> 00:48:58,828
All right can I have
your guys attention?

915
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:01,209
We have 10 hours to showtime.

916
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:03,142
Come on let's try to

917
00:49:03,144 --> 00:49:05,041
- get some sleep!
- 99.

918
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:07,181
- tired!
- Come on, get some sleep!

919
00:49:07,183 --> 00:49:08,458
- Sh!
- Sh!

920
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,563
You're kidding me.

921
00:49:10,565 --> 00:49:11,875
- Don't worry about it.
- Cell phone hasn't worked

922
00:49:11,877 --> 00:49:13,981
for hours, is
anybody even through?

923
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,397
Make it, this time, on time.

924
00:49:16,399 --> 00:49:19,641
Yeah, about three hours coach.

925
00:49:19,643 --> 00:49:22,472
We're gonna take a
shortcut down Highway 51,

926
00:49:22,474 --> 00:49:24,200
through Moccasin Gap.

927
00:49:25,201 --> 00:49:26,856
- Okay.
- No worries Coach.

928
00:49:26,858 --> 00:49:27,995
The rest of this trip gonna go

929
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:29,686
quicker than 5th Grade recess.

930
00:49:29,688 --> 00:49:31,172
- You'll see.
- Oh...

931
00:49:42,494 --> 00:49:44,737
Jack Scott, October 17th.

932
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:48,949
3:47 a.m..

933
00:49:52,193 --> 00:49:55,436
The more I review the
video footage of the

934
00:49:55,438 --> 00:49:59,992
bus incident the more it
is becoming very clear

935
00:49:59,994 --> 00:50:04,272
to me that there is something
much deeper going on here.

936
00:50:04,274 --> 00:50:07,344
I'm afraid the government
is gonna bury this thing.

937
00:50:07,346 --> 00:50:11,590
I don't know how they're
involved, if it's alien,

938
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:14,837
paranormal, some
experiment gone wrong.

939
00:50:17,494 --> 00:50:21,255
I just hope, and I
pray, the right people

940
00:50:21,257 --> 00:50:23,982
see my findings and
continue this investigation

941
00:50:23,984 --> 00:50:27,330
because we owe it to
every single one of those

942
00:50:27,332 --> 00:50:30,989
people who lost their
lives, I owe it to Kim,

943
00:50:30,991 --> 00:50:32,509
and to her family.

944
00:50:34,891 --> 00:50:37,998
So don't stop, no
matter what you do,

945
00:50:39,344 --> 00:50:42,036
do not stop until
this is solved.

946
00:51:06,302 --> 00:51:07,648
We just hit...

947
00:51:08,925 --> 00:51:10,891
- What did we hit?
- Everybody just stay down,

948
00:51:10,893 --> 00:51:12,375
stay in the bus!

949
00:51:12,377 --> 00:51:13,859
Coach come with me!

950
00:51:29,566 --> 00:51:30,498
Looky here!

951
00:51:33,087 --> 00:51:35,329
- Hey, what's under there?
- Kids, get, get back!

952
00:51:35,331 --> 00:51:37,331
Get back, don't get too close,

953
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:39,229
you don't know
what's under there!

954
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:40,058
Might have hit a

955
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,369
deer or a bear!

956
00:51:41,371 --> 00:51:43,406
- Maybe a polar bear.
- Could still be alive!

957
00:51:43,408 --> 00:51:44,821
Yeah why don't
you go take a look?

958
00:51:44,823 --> 00:51:47,962
- Get back on the bus!
- Hold on...

959
00:51:47,964 --> 00:51:50,449
To me it looks like...

960
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:54,003
Now what are you doing?

961
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:58,076
- Come on!
- What's going on?

962
00:51:58,078 --> 00:51:59,836
- What's that?
- What's going...

963
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:02,666
Oh, you found something!

964
00:52:02,668 --> 00:52:03,944
- What is that?
- Oh!

965
00:52:03,946 --> 00:52:05,531
- What is that?
- What the is that?

966
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:07,188
- That is the damnedest thing...
- Don't touch it,

967
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,396
you don't know what it is!

968
00:52:08,398 --> 00:52:10,571
- What is that?
- It's nasty!

969
00:52:14,439 --> 00:52:18,096
- It's under the bus.
- Get on the bus!

970
00:52:18,098 --> 00:52:20,512
- Let's go!
- That looks nasty!

971
00:52:20,514 --> 00:52:22,893
Hey guys, guys quiet!

972
00:52:22,895 --> 00:52:23,860
Quiet, I heard something!

973
00:52:25,346 --> 00:52:26,656
Quiet!

974
00:52:36,081 --> 00:52:37,322
Sh!

975
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:39,393
Stop it, wait a
minute, it's not...

976
00:52:39,395 --> 00:52:41,533
- What's going on man?
- Everyone on the bus!

977
00:52:41,535 --> 00:52:42,948
On the bus, on the bus,

978
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:44,053
on the bus, everyone on the

979
00:52:44,055 --> 00:52:45,330
bus now!

980
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:47,056
On the bus!

981
00:52:47,058 --> 00:52:49,092
Something's
on the roof!

982
00:52:49,094 --> 00:52:50,507
Get in the bus!

983
00:52:50,509 --> 00:52:52,026
On the bus, on the bus!

984
00:52:52,028 --> 00:52:53,717
Get on the bus now!

985
00:52:56,999 --> 00:52:59,620
Shut the windows!

986
00:52:59,622 --> 00:53:01,587
- Shut the windows!
- What's out there?

987
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:05,246
Can't see anything.

988
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,110
- Anyone see anything?
- You can't see anything...

989
00:53:09,459 --> 00:53:10,872
Nobody leave
the bus until we

990
00:53:10,874 --> 00:53:12,702
- know what's out there.
- what's this thing?

991
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:16,947
Wait, wait!

992
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:19,847
Listen, is that Diamond?

993
00:53:19,849 --> 00:53:22,332
That is
Diamond, isn't it?

994
00:53:22,334 --> 00:53:25,266
- Oh my.
- Ron, where's Emily?

995
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:27,372
- Oh my god!
- Oh my god...

996
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:29,512
Wait, Emily...

997
00:53:29,514 --> 00:53:31,272
Where's Coach Emily?

998
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,619
- Where is she?
- Emily!

999
00:53:33,621 --> 00:53:35,759
- Emily!
- We need to open this door!

1000
00:53:45,737 --> 00:53:47,702
I'll go find her!

1001
00:53:47,704 --> 00:53:49,152
- Close that!
- DJ!

1002
00:53:49,154 --> 00:53:51,223
- Close the door behind me!
- Nobody open a window!

1003
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:56,642
Don't open the window!

1004
00:53:56,644 --> 00:53:58,989
Oh my.

1005
00:53:58,991 --> 00:54:00,922
Anybody see him?

1006
00:54:00,924 --> 00:54:04,547
You, get away
from the window man!

1007
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:07,550
Ow.

1008
00:54:07,552 --> 00:54:09,069
I can't see a thing.

1009
00:54:09,071 --> 00:54:11,243
Give me that flashlight,
give me that flashlight!

1010
00:54:18,218 --> 00:54:20,356
- Calm down!
- Where'd he go?

1011
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:21,667
- See him?
- I don't see anything!

1012
00:54:21,669 --> 00:54:24,291
- Where did he go?
- It's too dark!

1013
00:54:24,293 --> 00:54:27,328
- What's going on man?
- It's pitch black!

1014
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:30,193
Anyone see anything?

1015
00:54:30,195 --> 00:54:31,919
It stopped, it stopped.

1016
00:54:31,921 --> 00:54:33,231
Shut the window!

1017
00:54:33,233 --> 00:54:35,509
I see DJ, and he's being,

1018
00:54:35,511 --> 00:54:37,373
he's being dragged
into the woods!

1019
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,582
Carlos, shut up
this is no time for jokes!

1020
00:54:39,584 --> 00:54:40,617
But honest!

1021
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:42,516
- You heard her!
- Hello?

1022
00:54:42,518 --> 00:54:43,896
Hello, hello?

1023
00:54:43,898 --> 00:54:46,554
Can anyone, can
anyone hear me, hello?

1024
00:54:46,556 --> 00:54:48,763
Yes, this is
Ron O'Neil, come in!

1025
00:54:48,765 --> 00:54:49,868
- My ,

1026
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:50,972
- Stop it!
- something is trying

1027
00:54:50,974 --> 00:54:53,043
to break into our motor home.

1028
00:54:53,045 --> 00:54:54,252
Martin,
they're breaking

1029
00:54:54,254 --> 00:54:55,701
the windows!

1030
00:54:55,703 --> 00:54:57,462
Please send
some help, but, the police!

1031
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:59,740
We're at mile marker
36, on Highway...

1032
00:54:59,742 --> 00:55:02,191
Kids get under the table,

1033
00:55:02,193 --> 00:55:03,399
hide!

1034
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,921
Oh...

1035
00:55:08,923 --> 00:55:11,890
It stopped, it stopped.

1036
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,995
- I'm going out!

there's something on
the side of the bus.

1066

a place right there
called Moccasin Gap.

1101
00:58:22,151 --> 00:58:23,357
It's maybe three
or four miles away.

1102
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,290
I can do that in less than 30.

1103
00:58:25,292 --> 00:58:26,878
- We need help.
- You're insane!

1104
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,571
Everyone that's left
this bus is dead!

1105
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:32,815

1121
00:58:53,251 --> 00:58:54,664
- Don't go!

1122
00:58:54,666 --> 00:58:56,356

- Can I finish please?

1212
01:03:47,545 --> 01:03:50,580
- Can I finish please?
- Carlos.

1213
01:03:50,582 --> 01:03:54,343
Look, those things have not
bothered anyone on the bus.

1214
01:03:54,345 --> 01:03:56,621
Anyone that's gone out
there, they've gotten hurt!

1215
01:03:56,623 --> 01:03:58,036
- Hmm...
- In their territory!

1216
01:03:58,038 --> 01:03:59,728
- He has a point.
- They're the encroachers,

1217
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:02,903
- we're the polar bears!
- Wait wait, I, I ,

1218
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:05,457
shut the hell up, please!

1219
01:04:05,459 --> 01:04:08,046
In combat it's rule one,
secure your perimeter,

1220
01:04:08,048 --> 01:04:10,186
protect your wagons, its basic!

1221
01:04:10,188 --> 01:04:11,774
This couldn't come from

1222
01:04:11,776 --> 01:04:14,432
Seriously?

1223
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,745
Why don't you go say a
prayer, or something?

1224
01:04:16,747 --> 01:04:17,953
Carlos!

1225
01:04:17,955 --> 01:04:19,299
What the fuck you

1226
01:04:19,301 --> 01:04:20,680
I'm trying to help
each other out here

1227
01:04:20,682 --> 01:04:24,925
- are you serious?
- not now!

1228
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:28,549
Fulci, you've been out
there, what do you think?

1229
01:04:28,551 --> 01:04:30,897
I really think that
we make our stand here,

1230
01:04:30,899 --> 01:04:32,484
we make this our Alamo.

1231
01:04:32,486 --> 01:04:34,003
- I agree.
- Wait a second guys

1232
01:04:34,005 --> 01:04:35,246
- are you serious?
- I'm not going out there.

1233
01:04:35,248 --> 01:04:36,730
We don't even know
what we're up against!

1234
01:04:36,732 --> 01:04:39,250
I mean, they could honestly
be animals, think about that.

1235
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,186
Hold it, wait a minute,

1236
01:04:44,188 --> 01:04:46,671
listen to what he has to say!

1237
01:04:46,673 --> 01:04:47,743
Devon, go on.

1238
01:04:49,227 --> 01:04:52,021
Guys, the only thing I'm
trying to say, is what do

1239
01:04:52,023 --> 01:04:55,300
we know scientifically
what's real, okay?

1240
01:04:55,302 --> 01:04:58,718
AC, can they even be killed,
I mean do they need oxygen,

1241
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,341
nutrition, substances to
survive they're nocturnal so,

1242
01:05:01,343 --> 01:05:03,861
what if it's dawn, what do
they go away, or what else...

1243
01:05:03,863 --> 01:05:07,830
Who care, who cares why
they're out there, who cares?

1244
01:05:07,832 --> 01:05:11,040
He's right, these things,
they're not demons from Hell

1245
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:12,801
or voodoo spirits!

1246
01:05:12,803 --> 01:05:15,251
I say they're biological.

1247
01:05:15,253 --> 01:05:17,978
Maybe, that's not
necessarily true though.

1248
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,255
But everything on
this planet that has

1249
01:05:19,257 --> 01:05:20,707
ever lived, dies.

1250
01:05:21,604 --> 01:05:23,225
Everything on this planet,

1251
01:05:23,227 --> 01:05:25,054
even that's another
assumption that we're trying...

1252
01:05:25,056 --> 01:05:27,091
- Wait wait wait wait...
- Basically you're saying

1253
01:05:27,093 --> 01:05:28,678
we have to discover
their weak point, right?

1254
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,439
Exactly, so guys, what
do we know about them?

1255
01:05:30,441 --> 01:05:31,923
Think about it, just think
about it for a second!

1256
01:05:31,925 --> 01:05:33,235
For number one,

1257
01:05:33,237 --> 01:05:35,271
they're tangible.

1258
01:05:35,273 --> 01:05:37,239
When Carlos was under the
bus, he felt something.

1259
01:05:37,241 --> 01:05:38,171
Right, something

1260
01:05:38,173 --> 01:05:41,797
touched my hair!

1261
01:05:43,247 --> 01:05:45,903
this
area, this road, uh...

1262
01:05:45,905 --> 01:05:47,801
Hey hey Kapax, maybe we're

1263
01:05:47,803 --> 01:05:49,113
in the Twilight Zone!

1264
01:05:49,115 --> 01:05:50,562
- Oh...
- Shut up!

1265
01:05:51,876 --> 01:05:53,393
Hey hey!

1266
01:05:53,395 --> 01:05:55,464
- Guys guys guys!
- Hey!

1267
01:05:55,466 --> 01:05:57,431
- Ridiculous!
- Even if he's right,

1268
01:05:57,433 --> 01:05:58,743
what are we gonna do
about it because we're

1269
01:05:58,745 --> 01:05:59,779
stuck on this bus!

1270
01:06:05,821 --> 01:06:07,510
- We have to a plan!
- There's nothing we can do!

1271
01:06:07,512 --> 01:06:10,790
- ridiculous!
- I'm not going anywhere!

1272
01:06:10,792 --> 01:06:14,483
We have to stay here.

1273
01:06:14,485 --> 01:06:16,209
I mean look what
happened to Connor.

1274
01:06:16,211 --> 01:06:19,108
- It killed two of us.
- Does anyone have a plan?

1275
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:20,800
- Stay on the bus!
- Get off the bus!

1276
01:06:20,802 --> 01:06:22,560
We...

1277
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:24,320
If we don't get off this bus

1278
01:06:24,322 --> 01:06:26,564
- we're all gonna die!
- Get off the bus!

1279
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:29,601
- We have to Jaiden!
- Just be quiet and think!

1280
01:06:29,603 --> 01:06:31,880
- Thanks, calm down!
- Stay positive!

1281
01:06:31,882 --> 01:06:33,743
- Positive?
- So you want positive?

1282
01:06:33,745 --> 01:06:35,331
Positive okay!

1283
01:06:35,333 --> 01:06:36,229
So that's it, calm down!

1284
01:06:36,231 --> 01:06:38,990
Let's do!

1285
01:06:38,992 --> 01:06:40,820
Circle our wagons, ridiculous!

1286
01:06:40,822 --> 01:06:42,373
- Secure our...
- Yeah right.

1287
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:44,032
- Stupid.
- Whatever.

1288
01:07:03,637 --> 01:07:06,604
Oh my god!

1289
01:07:36,084 --> 01:07:37,911
What is that?

1290
01:07:37,913 --> 01:07:39,018
What is that?

1291
01:07:43,746 --> 01:07:45,643
Did you guys see this?

1292
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:46,473
This is...

1293
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:51,340
Man I can't believe
the damage it did here.

1294
01:07:52,997 --> 01:07:56,171
This is ,
this is crazy.

1295
01:07:56,173 --> 01:07:57,586
I'm
gonna shut the windows now.

1296
01:07:57,588 --> 01:07:59,553
Come
and look at this!

1297
01:07:59,555 --> 01:08:01,383
Do you see this right here?

1298
01:08:01,385 --> 01:08:03,937
Oh my god!

1299
01:08:03,939 --> 01:08:06,873
How many of these
things are there?

1300
01:08:14,743 --> 01:08:15,845
What the fuck!

1301
01:08:15,847 --> 01:08:17,364
Close the window!

1302
01:08:17,366 --> 01:08:19,056
Get it, close it!

1303
01:08:36,075 --> 01:08:36,936
- Oh my god!
- Those damn things

1304
01:08:36,938 --> 01:08:37,902
are strong!

1305
01:08:37,904 --> 01:08:39,941
- I know okay.
- You okay?

1306
01:08:41,287 --> 01:08:42,320
Come on.

1307
01:08:42,322 --> 01:08:45,254
You okay?

1308
01:08:45,256 --> 01:08:48,016
- That was too close.
- Yeah.

1309
01:08:48,018 --> 01:08:49,086
Are we keeping,

1310
01:08:49,088 --> 01:08:50,259
the window locked?

1311
01:08:50,261 --> 01:08:52,020
The window's
locked,.

1312
01:08:52,022 --> 01:08:53,400
You okay?

1313
01:08:53,402 --> 01:08:55,885
What if,

1314
01:08:55,887 --> 01:08:57,404
what if this is all a plot?

1315
01:08:57,406 --> 01:08:58,683
What?

1316
01:08:59,995 --> 01:09:01,684
What if they're working
through one of us?

1317
01:09:01,686 --> 01:09:04,584
Well DJ!

1318
01:09:04,586 --> 01:09:06,793
He brought them on
this piece of crap bus!

1319
01:09:06,795 --> 01:09:08,484
Maybe he was one of them!

1320
01:09:08,486 --> 01:09:10,383
DJ's gone,
why would they take him?

1321
01:09:10,385 --> 01:09:12,972
- Exactly!
- Yeah calm down!

1322
01:09:12,974 --> 01:09:14,697
I get it!

1323
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:17,148
- Gail,!
- We're your friends!

1324
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:19,150
Yeah calm down!

1325
01:09:19,152 --> 01:09:20,600
It's crazy,
we're your friends!

1326
01:09:20,602 --> 01:09:21,981
Well maybe they're
working through one of us!

1327
01:09:23,122 --> 01:09:25,985
- No of course not!
- Come on...

1328
01:09:25,987 --> 01:09:27,745
Maybe it's
working through you!

1329
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,781
Come on
Gail, that's crazy!

1330
01:09:29,783 --> 01:09:31,956
- How about you!
- Turn off the

1331
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:33,095
camera man!

1332
01:09:33,097 --> 01:09:34,752
It's all right!

1333
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:37,272
- Gail calm down!
- I know how you feel!

1334
01:09:37,274 --> 01:09:39,653
How can we be sure?

1335
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:46,384
Get back!

1336
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:52,977
We need to
block these windows!

1337
01:10:03,334 --> 01:10:05,127
- They're all blocked?
- You all right?

1338
01:10:05,129 --> 01:10:07,129
- Everything's blocked.
- For now.

1339
01:10:09,444 --> 01:10:11,961
Gonna have to, stay
away from the windows!

1340
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:24,284
That's it bro!

1341
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:25,803
It's all dead!

1342
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,598
- You okay?
- You gonna be okay man?

1343
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,290
- I'm okay,...
- Are you sure, you sure?

1344
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:31,257
- Look...
- You're all right?

1345
01:10:33,054 --> 01:10:34,777
- Look, ew!
- Devon was right!

1346
01:10:34,779 --> 01:10:35,847
He killed it man,

1347
01:10:35,849 --> 01:10:36,676
that's it!

1348
01:10:36,678 --> 01:10:37,987
- What is that?
- Yes!

1349
01:10:37,989 --> 01:10:39,230
Listen, listen, we need

1350
01:10:39,232 --> 01:10:41,370
to find anything we
can use to kill these

1351
01:10:41,372 --> 01:10:42,682
things!

1352
01:10:42,684 --> 01:10:45,616
Let's go, let's go,
let's find something!

1353
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:03,427
Watch out
the windows doll.

1354
01:11:03,429 --> 01:11:04,531
Carlos!

1355
01:11:04,533 --> 01:11:06,913
Carlos don't move!

1356
01:11:06,915 --> 01:11:08,156
It's, what it's not a weapon!

1357
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:09,364
It's dangerous!

1358
01:11:09,366 --> 01:11:10,917
- I found it!
- It's!

1359
01:11:12,748 --> 01:11:13,989
What the...

1360
01:11:13,991 --> 01:11:15,956
Whoa easy guys!

1361
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:18,373
- Easy, calm down!
- Calm down, take it easy!

1362
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:19,203
AC!

1363
01:11:21,757 --> 01:11:23,378
These things
keep trying to confuse us.

1364
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,069
Yeah well they're
doing a great job!

1365
01:11:25,071 --> 01:11:26,864
- Just stay focused.
- Look guys, I really

1366
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:28,762
don't think these things
are that smart I mean,

1367
01:11:28,764 --> 01:11:30,868
they keep on making new entrances
and they already have 'em!

1368
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,352
- Right, yeah.
- Wish I could see these

1369
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:35,252
- things!
- And they're so quiet,

1370
01:11:35,254 --> 01:11:37,012
when they want to be!

1371
01:11:37,014 --> 01:11:39,394
Oh my god!

1372
01:12:14,948 --> 01:12:17,710
Oh god I hit
Devon, I'm so sorry!

1373
01:12:19,021 --> 01:12:20,780
- Okay,...
- Oh jeez I'm sorry...

1374
01:12:24,648 --> 01:12:28,995
- Okay, okay, hold on..
- Keep applying pressure.

1375
01:12:28,997 --> 01:12:34,002
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, okay...
- Oh, okay...

1376
01:12:41,665 --> 01:12:42,767
God dammit!

1377
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:51,362
I think they're dead!

1378
01:12:51,364 --> 01:12:54,022
Or at least, it drove 'em off!

1379
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,336
Or it couldn't handle
the fire extinguisher!

1380
01:13:03,756 --> 01:13:04,584
Mom...

1381
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,313
Dad.

1382
01:13:11,142 --> 01:13:16,147
This is Julie, please
pick up, please!

1383
01:13:26,365 --> 01:13:29,331
On second thought...

1384
01:13:29,333 --> 01:13:32,854
Please pick up!

1385
01:13:43,451 --> 01:13:45,625
We're being attacked by...

1386
01:13:47,351 --> 01:13:49,353
By some, by something...

1387
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:55,532
I just want to tell you,

1388
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:59,605
I love you both, I
love you so much!

1389
01:14:10,547 --> 01:14:11,996
Hug Bobby for me.

1390
01:14:17,692 --> 01:14:18,969
Please pick up!

1391
01:14:31,844 --> 01:14:34,398
Did you get through?

1392
01:14:37,298 --> 01:14:38,989
Just a voice mail.

1393
01:15:10,227 --> 01:15:11,297
AC you awake?

1394
01:15:12,402 --> 01:15:13,264
Yeah.

1395
01:15:15,336 --> 01:15:16,578
What's worse?

1396
01:15:17,959 --> 01:15:20,133
The silence, or the noise?

1397
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:24,275
Do you think they're gone?

1398
01:15:25,415 --> 01:15:28,139
They've been quiet
for so long now.

1399
01:15:28,141 --> 01:15:29,934
Not really.

1400
01:15:29,936 --> 01:15:34,044
They're a warrior like,
attack, retreat, regroup.

1401
01:15:35,217 --> 01:15:37,772
Attack, like they
have a mission.

1402
01:15:40,637 --> 01:15:41,946
So you don't think
they're done yet?

1403
01:15:41,948 --> 01:15:46,608
They don't
know how to quit.

1404
01:15:48,058 --> 01:15:51,059
I guess there's no hope.

1405
01:15:51,061 --> 01:15:53,166
Army 101, be a realist.

1406
01:15:55,306 --> 01:15:58,377
Know what can happen,
how to handle it.

1407
01:15:58,379 --> 01:15:59,932
Live in the moment.

1408
01:16:06,076 --> 01:16:07,178
What's that?

1409
01:16:09,424 --> 01:16:10,287
Listen!

1410
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:14,979
It sounds like a panther.

1411
01:16:39,005 --> 01:16:42,075
Do you hear that?

1412
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:45,218
No mercy.

1413
01:16:46,496 --> 01:16:49,151
The survival of the fittest.

1414
01:16:49,153 --> 01:16:51,328
You win or you go extinct.

1415
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:56,160
Does anything
really matter anymore?

1416
01:16:57,092 --> 01:16:59,921
It's a long way from yesterday.

1417
01:16:59,923 --> 01:17:01,442
Tell me about it.

1418
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:13,592
Babe, hey!

1419
01:17:15,386 --> 01:17:16,800
Hey!

1420
01:17:16,802 --> 01:17:19,285
We won't, we won't, we won't,
just calm down, please!

1421
01:17:19,287 --> 01:17:22,046
gotta get me
out of here,!

1422
01:17:22,048 --> 01:17:24,463
Give me a second, calm down!

1423
01:17:24,465 --> 01:17:26,430
- We're gonna be all right!
- Get me out of here!

1424
01:17:26,432 --> 01:17:27,673
Look I'm gonna protect you,

1425
01:17:27,675 --> 01:17:29,606
I'll protect you, and our baby!

1426
01:17:29,608 --> 01:17:31,262
Nothing can
protect me from them!

1427
01:17:31,264 --> 01:17:34,162
Just,
please, come on,

1428
01:17:34,164 --> 01:17:35,335
get away from the door,

1429
01:17:35,337 --> 01:17:36,544
- come on, sit down!
- Oh my god!

1430
01:17:36,546 --> 01:17:39,512
Oh my god, our baby!

1431
01:17:39,514 --> 01:17:43,136
I'm gonna
protect you, and the baby!

1432
01:17:43,138 --> 01:17:44,621
- Just...
- Oh god!

1433
01:17:44,623 --> 01:17:49,453
Just,...

1434
01:17:49,455 --> 01:17:50,663
Oh my goodness!

1435
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:01,500
the extinguisher!

1436
01:18:03,296 --> 01:18:06,783
Don't lose our!

1437
01:18:21,901 --> 01:18:25,249
Get down!

1438
01:18:39,574 --> 01:18:40,437
Oh god!

1439
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:45,304
It's not over.

1440
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:49,306
- Is it?
- These, damn things

1441
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:51,860
just keep coming and coming.

1442
01:18:51,862 --> 01:18:54,622
I just wish things
would have been different.

1443
01:18:54,624 --> 01:18:58,177
I mean, you guys are the only
real familia I've ever had.

1444
01:18:58,179 --> 01:19:02,217
You.

1445
01:19:11,537 --> 01:19:12,709
You in pain bro?

1446
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:15,539
I'll manage.

1447
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:18,507
Is there anything else I
can do for you, anything!

1448
01:19:18,509 --> 01:19:22,822
Well, about 1000 milligrams
of morphine would be nice.

1449
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:25,031
- Oh...
- Or maybe a fifth of vodka.

1450
01:19:26,794 --> 01:19:28,932
Well I'll just
call in for delivery.

1451
01:19:28,934 --> 01:19:30,556
Yeah you do that.

1452
01:19:36,113 --> 01:19:37,839
It's gonna be okay.

1453
01:19:40,048 --> 01:19:43,981
I just, feel
like I can't save anyone.

1454
01:19:43,983 --> 01:19:46,745
What's gonna
happen to you, us?

1455
01:19:48,678 --> 01:19:50,712
I don't know,
maybe if someone...

1456
01:19:50,714 --> 01:19:52,992
It's so awful, so random!

1457
01:19:54,442 --> 01:19:55,512
I don't know.

1458
01:19:56,893 --> 01:20:00,482
Do you believe in well,
in God or anything?

1459
01:20:01,863 --> 01:20:05,313
I, I do believe that
there's something out there,

1460
01:20:05,315 --> 01:20:07,418
I just don't know what it is.

1461
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:10,111
I mean I think
about it a lot, I do.

1462
01:20:10,113 --> 01:20:12,044
What's it all mean?

1463
01:20:12,046 --> 01:20:14,807
Is it fair, or
just, just random?

1464
01:20:16,119 --> 01:20:18,119
And what comes next?

1465
01:20:18,121 --> 01:20:20,226
Does anything make sense?

1466
01:20:21,642 --> 01:20:24,299
Right now nothing makes sense.

1467
01:20:27,061 --> 01:20:28,888
- Medikit!
- Madison, something's wrong

1468
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:30,131
- with Madison!
- Oh god Madison!

1469
01:20:30,133 --> 01:20:30,959
It's Madison,

1470
01:20:30,961 --> 01:20:31,960
she's crashing!

1471
01:20:31,962 --> 01:20:34,653
Medikit!

1472
01:20:34,655 --> 01:20:36,620
- Well what color is it?
- It's black!

1473
01:20:36,622 --> 01:20:38,518
- We're gonna be okay.
- Oh my god!

1474
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,555
We're gonna be okay.

1475
01:20:40,557 --> 01:20:43,109
- Julie I think I got it!
- Come on,.

1476
01:20:43,111 --> 01:20:45,456
Calm down...

1477
01:20:45,458 --> 01:20:47,666
Hurry!

1478
01:20:47,668 --> 01:20:49,737
I got it!

1479
01:20:49,739 --> 01:20:52,636
No!

1480
01:21:45,346 --> 01:21:48,243
Madison!

1481
01:21:48,245 --> 01:21:49,797
- Madison!
- Madison!

1482
01:21:51,076 --> 01:21:52,696
- Madison please...
- Where are you?

1483
01:21:52,698 --> 01:21:54,802
- Shane, come back!
- Madison!

1484
01:21:54,804 --> 01:21:56,631
- Come back!
- Shane!

1485
01:21:56,633 --> 01:21:58,702
- Come on, come on...
- Get back in here!

1486
01:22:02,328 --> 01:22:04,570
Madison!

1487
01:22:39,952 --> 01:22:42,815
None of
you care about me!

1488
01:22:42,817 --> 01:22:45,337
Carlos, we are your friends!

1489
01:22:46,959 --> 01:22:50,894
Take it easy Carlos,
we're not the enemy man!

1490
01:22:52,447 --> 01:22:55,138
You are not the enemy.

1491
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:58,624
But you're not my
friends either!

1492
01:22:58,626 --> 01:23:01,454
All, always the alternate!

1493
01:23:01,456 --> 01:23:03,217
Do you guys see that?

1494
01:23:04,666 --> 01:23:06,323
None of you love me!

1495
01:23:07,497 --> 01:23:11,777
None of
you care about me!

1496
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:23,131
Carlos, Carlos,
wait, it's okay, okay?

1497
01:23:23,133 --> 01:23:25,893
We're family, we love you.

1498
01:23:25,895 --> 01:23:27,929
Remember in state championship?

1499
01:23:27,931 --> 01:23:31,415
We wouldn't have won
without you, okay?

1500
01:23:31,417 --> 01:23:33,210
- Liar.
- We love you so much!

1501
01:23:34,938 --> 01:23:36,420
- Really?
- Debates wouldn't be the same

1502
01:23:36,422 --> 01:23:39,389
without you, you're so funny,

1503
01:23:39,391 --> 01:23:41,840
you're the funniest we know!

1504
01:23:41,842 --> 01:23:45,740
Okay, just calm down,
it's gonna be okay.

1505
01:23:45,742 --> 01:23:47,259
Look, yes,

1506
01:23:47,261 --> 01:23:48,847
- Sit down, sit down.
- it's okay.

1507
01:23:48,849 --> 01:23:51,263
No, we're gonna make it,

1508
01:23:51,265 --> 01:23:53,575
- we're gonna live, okay?
- No...

1509
01:23:53,577 --> 01:23:55,301
Please...

1510
01:24:28,095 --> 01:24:30,302
Guys listen up.

1511
01:24:31,477 --> 01:24:33,063
I have a plan.

1512
01:24:33,065 --> 01:24:34,340
Not again.

1513
01:24:34,342 --> 01:24:36,170
Come on Devon,

1514
01:24:36,172 --> 01:24:38,793
whoever has the
gun is next to go!

1515
01:24:38,795 --> 01:24:40,210
Don't you get it?

1516
01:24:41,384 --> 01:24:43,349
I've been timing it all right?

1517
01:24:43,351 --> 01:24:47,353
I think we have a few
minuets in between attacks,

1518
01:24:47,355 --> 01:24:49,838
where we might be able to
get off this bus and live.

1519
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:50,911
No.

1520
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:54,673
No, please listen to me guys.

1521
01:24:57,296 --> 01:24:59,055
I'm gonna go out the front door.

1522
01:24:59,057 --> 01:25:00,815
I'm gonna shoot, I'm gonna yell,

1523
01:25:00,817 --> 01:25:02,748
and I'm gonna distract
them while you guys

1524
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:05,026
go out the back door.

1525
01:25:05,028 --> 01:25:06,027
And then I'm gonna circle around

1526
01:25:06,029 --> 01:25:08,618
and meet you on the other side.

1527
01:25:10,413 --> 01:25:12,931
Does anybody else
have a better idea?

1528
01:25:12,933 --> 01:25:15,797
Please,
no more heroics!

1529
01:25:18,386 --> 01:25:21,318
So we should just
sit here, and wait?

1530
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:24,459
Devon!

1531
01:25:24,461 --> 01:25:27,050
I'll take it with me, thanks.

1532
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:33,022
Josh, Jaiden, good luck.

1533
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:37,714
I hope you make it out
of this because your baby

1534
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:40,061
definitely needs you guys.

1535
01:25:40,063 --> 01:25:42,928
We need good parents
in the world.

1536
01:25:44,343 --> 01:25:45,931
And one more thing,

1537
01:25:49,417 --> 01:25:51,592
it's now or never I guess.

1538
01:25:58,219 --> 01:25:59,839
I want you guys to know I
had you in the debate team

1539
01:25:59,841 --> 01:26:01,326
in the first place.

1540
01:26:02,499 --> 01:26:04,361
I know I'm a geek
and I know that

1541
01:26:04,363 --> 01:26:06,710
and I have those tendencies.

1542
01:26:08,126 --> 01:26:11,957
But I wanted to be with
someone so special, so...

1543
01:26:13,338 --> 01:26:14,166
Amazing.

1544
01:26:15,271 --> 01:26:17,618
It was because of you Julie.

1545
01:26:18,999 --> 01:26:23,001
Maybe some way, I
understand what love is.

1546
01:26:23,003 --> 01:26:26,040
And, I just want
you to know, I just,

1547
01:26:29,975 --> 01:26:31,528
wanted you to know.

1548
01:26:33,116 --> 01:26:34,462
Devon.

1549
01:26:37,741 --> 01:26:38,846
I, I never...

1550
01:27:03,629 --> 01:27:05,286
Devon don't do this.

1551
01:27:07,047 --> 01:27:07,875
Sorry.

1552
01:27:09,221 --> 01:27:12,397
Yes I have to before
I change my mind.

1553
01:27:15,883 --> 01:27:17,712
Gimme 15 seconds guys.

1554
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:22,372
See you guys on the other side.

1555
01:27:26,583 --> 01:27:28,585
Let's get out of here!

1556
01:27:48,053 --> 01:27:51,815
Oh my god!

1557
01:29:37,058 --> 01:29:41,062
Josh, we gotta go buy
a stroller for the baby.

1558
01:31:15,502 --> 01:31:18,677
It's October 20th,
2011, 12:43 a.m..

1559
01:31:24,442 --> 01:31:27,235
