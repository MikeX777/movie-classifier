1
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,882
ALL IS SILENCE

2
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,561
What's that for?

3
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,449
Use your mouth to keep quiet.

4
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,886
Your dad can fish, but I'll show you
how it's really done.

5
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,730
My dad can name every fish

6
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,001
in the world.

7
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,681
Well, almost.

8
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,889
Names? Names don't matter.
Catching them is what counts.

9
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,608
My dad says if you're poor for too long
you'll shit white like <i>a</i> seagull.

10
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,767
Crab.

11
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,805
How long can you hold your breath?

12
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,209
Don't know, about half an hour.

13
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,044
Half an hour my ass.

14
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,122
You see?

15
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,288
Now that's <i>a</i> miracle!

16
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,245
Brinco, get me out of here!

17
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,286
What a bastard!
I'm fine, damn it!

18
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,041
Brinco! Brinco!

19
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,130
Brinco! Brinco! Brinco!

20
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,250
Damn the day you were born!

21
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,807
What are you doing?
That brings bad luck.

22
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,883
Quit yapping and help me.

23
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,126
Look, there's <i>a</i> disgusting
creature inside.

24
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,129
Come back to life, shithead.
Look who's here.

25
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,003
You dummies.
Never joke about death.

26
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,724
He looked dead, Leda.

27
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,049
You should have seen him.
He fell and turned pale, stiff.

28
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,690
Damn, Fins. You looked dead.

29
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,927
- He has "absences."
- "Absences?"

30
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,124
Yeah, "absences." That's what
they call it. Don't tell anybody.

31
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,921
And those coffins?

32
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,327
- They're spoken for.
- Not your dad, of course.

33
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,362
- He says he saw them first.
- He did.

34
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,085
Keep quiet, you're dead.

35
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,447
They're hippies.

36
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,965
Heard in Ultramar.

37
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,450
They look German to me.

38
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,447
Think it's French.

39
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,161
Who cares what they're saying?
You can tell by what they're doing.

40
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,806
If they're hippies,
they speak hippie, you idiots.

41
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,087
I'm up here!

42
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,242
It's Chelin.

43
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,646
Bet he found something!

44
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,527
No wonder. Running around
with that damn pendulum all day...

45
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,966
Leda thinks it works.

46
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,766
Leda believes
whatever she wants to.

47
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,562
You see?

48
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,651
He does it with his wrist.
You're <i>a</i> fraud, Chelin. Let me.

49
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,527
Come on, let's go.

50
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,563
NATURAL SCIENCES

51
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,569
HUMAN LIFE STUDIES

52
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,569
PRACTICAL GEOGRAPHY

53
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,691
Damn, Chelin.
This is what call <i>a</i> treasure!

54
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,922
Goddamn it, Carburo!

55
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,243
It's okay, kids.
It's okay.

56
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,244
Some people love artillery.

57
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,527
Always tell him, "Carburo,
first ask questions and shoot after."

58
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,842
Sweetie, where did you come from?

59
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,411
You can ask my mother that.

60
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,041
Does this saintly woman
have <i>a</i> name?

61
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,729
She did. Her name was Adela.
She died when was born.

62
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,087
Damn, they sure grow up quick!

63
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,329
They're unrecognizable.

64
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,331
Okay, an

65
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,566
Nothing happened here,

66
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,644
you didn't hear anything,
you didn't see anything.

67
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,123
That's the thing about Latin,
one thing leads to another.

68
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,926
Everybody go home.

69
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,241
Tonight

70
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,963
the sky is gonna crash down
on somebody's head.

71
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,690
It's finally dying down,
the son of <i>a</i> bitch.

72
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,048
How long have gone
without fishing, Amparo?

73
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,804
One month and three days.

74
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,844
Seems like three years.

75
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,131
Prison was better than this.

76
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,890
So was the hospital.

77
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,601
Me in prison, you in the hospital...

78
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,006
It wasn't so bad.

79
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,321
We should put <i>a</i>
match to this life

80
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,566
and to hell with it.

81
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,000
You're <i>a</i> wreck, Malpica.

82
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,570
You used to be more patient.

83
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,607
Well, before,
cried with one eye

84
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,325
and laughed with the other.

85
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,286
Father, have you ever seen
an Argonaut?

86
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,251
Once when <i>a</i> Soviet ship
crashed off the coast.

87
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,966
Russians.

88
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,086
The sailors wore black leather jackets.
Really good ones.

89
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,210
Don't mean people.
Look what it says here.

90
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,727
"These cephalopods
are very ugly animals"

91
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,086
and their bodies contain

92
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,801
grotesque particularities.
If you look into the eyes

93
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,446
"of an Argonaut,
you will find them blank."

94
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,162
Let me see.

95
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,521
This book was at
the School of the Indies.

96
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,525
They emigrated to America, made money
and decided to build <i>a</i> school.

97
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,160
The best school around.

98
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,602
A modern school, they called it.
They brought typewriters,

99
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,049
sewing machines, thermometers,
barometers...

100
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,928
Even <i>a</i> skeleton so we could learn
the name of every bone.

101
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,201
All of them.

102
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,767
What's the most important bone
in the body?

103
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,886
The spheroid bone.

104
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,326
The teacher used to say...

105
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,961
How did it go?

106
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,366
"Children,"

107
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,041
this is the key.
The spheroid bone.

108
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,883
The bone shaped like <i>a</i>
Turkish bed and bat wings

109
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,246
which quietly opened
through the course of history

110
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,484
"to make room for the enigmatic
workings of the soul."

111
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,602
Damn, still remember, Amparo!

112
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,684
If you were there, don'! go back.

113
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,001
Why?

114
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,166
Because say so.

115
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,642
Study.

116
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,161
Amparo.

117
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,922
If this weather keeps up, the boy...

118
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,566
I'm sorry, but he'll have
to clean barrels.

119
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,244
He gets dizzy in the barrels.

120
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,283
He gets dizzy everywhere, Amparo.
Everywhere.

121
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,328
Trust me, son. Never tell anyone
about your absences.

122
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,930
Don't tell anyone.

123
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,121
If you do, they won't hire you
and they'll say you're crazy.

124
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,924
Don't tell anyone.

125
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,531
Don't even tell the furniture.

126
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,401
You got that?

127
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,846
- What is it?
- You'll see.

128
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,010
Where are we going?

129
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,245
- It's unbelievable!
- Isn't it?

130
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,246
Look, Brinco.

131
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,244
The sea is <i>a</i> goldmine.
It can give you anything.

132
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,488
Who needs fertilizer?

133
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,529
Those oranges are mine.

134
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,960
Saw them first.

135
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,931
You know I'm right.
The booty of <i>a</i> shipwreck

136
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,408
- goes to whoever finds it.
- How much is it worth?

137
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,567
A lot

138
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,769
And don'! know if want to sell.

139
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,051
Here, seeing is hard work.

140
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,565
That's crap, Mr. Rumbo.

141
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,326
Close your eyes.

142
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,647
Now watch.

143
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,367
A woman can feel it in her skin.

144
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,291
- What was it, heads or tails?
- Tails.

145
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,484
You see? It's in her skin.
This one knew it

146
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,005
from day one.

147
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,209
She'll be rich someday.

148
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,330
Sure won't be poor!

149
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,568
Brinco.

150
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,761
Brinco, Brinco.

151
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,442
Brinco.

152
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,608
Brinco.

153
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,160
Brinco, come on.

154
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,840
You dummy.

155
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,126
Hi, boys.

156
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,811
Afternoon, Marshal, sir.

157
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,641
Well done.

158
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,685
If the barrels aren't clean...

159
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,242
What's the word? Immaculate.

160
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,168
The whole harvest gets ruined.

161
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,768
Just <i>a</i> tiny speck of shit...

162
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,965
and it all goes to hell.

163
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,527
How are you, Brinco?

164
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,921
And you?

165
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,366
Fins, sir.

166
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,320
Fins, Fins what?

167
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,771
I'm Malpica's son, sir.

168
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,885
Lucho Malpica.

169
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,045
A great sailor, your dad.

170
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,481
Yes, sir.

171
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,121
The best.

172
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,242
Remember, not even
<i>a</i> speck of shit.

173
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,286
The best sailor, strictu

174
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,287
senso.

175
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,931
And the most stubborn.

176
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,003
Damn, what <i>a</i> mule!

177
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,571
Eat them all.

178
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,849
The best, John Wayne.

179
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,045
John Wayne and <i>a</i> horse.

180
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,970
With that you have <i>a</i> movie.

181
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,401
You don'! need girls
or any other crap.

182
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,769
But he did have to change his name.

183
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,442
His name wasn't John?

184
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,442
No, his name wasn't John.
His name was Marion.

185
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,086
Marion?

186
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,561
No shit.

187
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,525
Where have you been?

188
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,125
Looked for you in the yard.

189
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,481
Omelette.

190
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,330
Your mother made it.

191
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,447
Look, Rumbo.

192
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,201
If the bad guy is good,
the movie is good.

193
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,526
Am right?

194
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,086
You are.

195
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,321
For example...

196
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,490
think I'd make <i>a</i> great bad guy.
What do you think?

197
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,691
Yes, Sergeant.
You'd make an amazing bad guy.

198
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,282
Well...

199
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,764
Don't be so sure.

200
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,847
Joan Crawford, Jennifer Jones,
Hedy Lamarr, Ava Gardner...

201
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,720
We're talking cinema, boss.

202
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,847
We're talking about women.
Joan Crawford, Jennifer Jones...

203
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,161
Gentlemen,

204
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,930
if we're talking about goddesses,
we should be speaking Latin.

205
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,323
Gloriosi corporis misterium.
The mystery of the glorious body.

206
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,923
Saint Thomas.

207
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,967
Three years of seminary school,
Sergeant.

208
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,442
Rumbo and talk about it
all the time.

209
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,880
Mutatis mutandis.

210
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,844
The body and soul

211
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,606
belong to John Wayne.

212
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,725
With him and <i>a</i> horse,

213
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,282
<i>you have a movie.
You don'! even need a girl.</i>

214
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,566
What for?

215
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,770
Not even the horse, just <i>a</i> gun.

216
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,801
You need <i>a</i> gun, of course.

217
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,241
Brinco.

218
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,602
Stay away from the school ruins.

219
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,366
It's <i>a</i> diabolical place,
everybody says so.

220
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,681
Pretty, isn't it?

221
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,241
Help me.

222
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,641
Let's take it.

223
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,366
Where?

224
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,041
Grab the feet. Gently.

225
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,571
Gently, she says!

226
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,570
...A western with kisses that kill.

227
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,767
On the right.

228
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,163
Tonight at the Paris Theater
in Noitia,

229
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,245
William Morris and Gene Pascua

230
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,050
in an unforgettable film.

231
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,801
What <i>a</i> beauty!

232
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,560
How much do you want for it?

233
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,205
It's not for sale.
It's priceless.

234
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,961
You're wrong!

235
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,963
Everything has <i>a</i>
price, sweetheart.

236
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,687
The roar of revolvers

237
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,969
and passion rising from the ashes...

238
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,370
Not the ruins...

239
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,362
Yes.

240
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,123
No.

241
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,122
Yes.

242
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,285
Where are you, Fins?

243
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,165
In Finland. How about you?

244
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,371
I'm in Brazil.

245
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,124
That's a long way away!

246
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,126
Okay. One, two, three.

247
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,091
I'm in Norway. And you?

248
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,002
- In the water.
- That's not <i>a</i> country.

249
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,770
Well, that's where am.

250
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,290
Okay. One, two, three.

251
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,211
I'm in the Belgian Congo.

252
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,761
I'm in Libya.

253
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,206
Meet me in Sudan.

254
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,964
We should go, before it falls.

255
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,687
It's okay. It won't fall.

256
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,366
Greenland,

257
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,766
Spain,

258
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,926
Ecuador

259
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,645
Antarctica...

260
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,248
It's time for the penalty kicks.

261
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,129
Up first, the amazing Brinco,

262
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,284
local icon and feared sharpshooter.

263
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,684
Impossible!
An amazing stop by Chelin.

264
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,842
The damn spider stops everything.

265
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,684
He blocked the kick.

266
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,969
Up next, Leda, stepping up

267
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,645
to the ball with confidence.

268
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,967
What's wrong?

269
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,445
Girls don'! kick penalties.

270
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,161
- Who says?
- Tell the truth, Chelin.

271
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,560
You're scared.

272
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,407
Chelin is shitting in his pants,
ladies and gentlemen.

273
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,488
No way, Belbis. I'm not <i>a</i> homo!

274
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,805
We know all too well

275
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,121
that God needs nobody's help
to impose His will.

276
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,331
He's almighty.

277
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,608
Then why did he create man?

278
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,404
Imagine for us to handle
the little things.

279
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,691
The metric decimal system,
for example.

280
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,010
Replacing broken tiles,
cleaning sewers...

281
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,483
That's why we must recognize

282
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,928
that someone like our generous
parishioner we know as the Marshal

283
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,842
is doing this world
<i>a</i> great service.

284
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,650
Even just by donating the modern
PA system we've just installed.

285
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,444
Thank you, Marshal, sir.

286
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,041
We will use this modern PA system

287
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,322
to spread church doctrine.

288
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,488
And, on occasion,
the mysteries of theology.

289
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,446
God,

290
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,722
not satisfied with creating man,

291
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,005
also created the two people
who with him

292
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,128
constitute the beautiful calling,

293
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,691
the Holy Trinity.

294
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,529
The Son, His son,

295
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,490
and the Holy Ghost.

296
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,044
An incomprehensible figure
represented by the dove.

297
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,011
Nothing is more beautiful.

298
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,371
Because what is the true shape
of the Holy Ghost?

299
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,646
Am!

300
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,766
Belbis!

301
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,641
Look, Belbis.

302
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,247
The Holy Ghost

303
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,845
is everywhere.

304
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,731
But no matter how much you insist,
you're not it.

305
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,848
So quit clowning around, damn it!

306
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,129
Tonight's first song is dedicated

307
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,124
to the nicest couple here.

308
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,722
Our beloved policemen, of course.

309
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,441
There's <i>a</i> shipment at the beach.
Get moving.

310
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,121
Slowly, slowly.

311
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,241
Always sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong.

312
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,164
We live here just like you.

313
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,206
You have an answer for everything.
My mom was right.

314
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,408
Look who's talking.
Your mom of all people.

315
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,170
Rumbo says we can start unloading
the tuna.

316
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,926
And these two Martians?

317
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,684
- They work for free.
- Great.

318
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,410
Not for free!

319
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,888
That's it, don'! sell yourself short.

320
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,003
Hey, that girl,
before you know it...

321
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,850
Pure dynamite.

322
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,801
That's the last one.

323
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,010
Nice going, Brinco.

324
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,288
You earned yourself <i>a</i> bill
with kings on it.

325
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,529
Never bring guests along

326
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,967
- without consulting me.
- They tag along.

327
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,887
"They tag along..."
Go on.

328
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,361
Good work!

329
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,610
Come on, the Marshal's going to pay us.

330
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,480
Get in line.

331
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,811
Thank you, Marshal, sir.

332
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,966
Thank you, sir.

333
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,286
Thank you, sir.

334
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,126
Thank you, sir.

335
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,641
Thank you, sir.

336
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,444
Boss, the police are coming.

337
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,321
They always have great timing.

338
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,490
Everybody stay pl!!...

339
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,208
What's going on here?

340
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,083
Evening, Sergeant.

341
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,929
You dropped two bills.

342
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,804
Estricto sensu, two green ones.

343
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,251
No, Marshal, sir.

344
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,810
Esticto sensu,

345
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,406
think dropped at least ten.

346
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,570
The footage is coming in,
it's still dark.

347
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,727
We can'! tell what's happening,
the image is black and white.

348
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,690
But this footage clearly reveals

349
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,446
that Aldrin, the 2nd astronaut
is still inside the lunar capsule...

350
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,601
Where'd you get that?

351
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,366
Mr. Rumbo paid me
for cleaning the barrels.

352
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,047
Nobody's ever paid that much
for cleaning barrels.

353
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,686
It's the truth.

354
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,930
Don't lie to me.

355
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,883
Silence is the worst lie of all.
Where'd you get it?

356
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,684
The Marshal paid me
for unloading tobacco.

357
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,041
That's more than make
in a whole damn week

358
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,770
fighting the sea.

359
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,524
You know how he got rich?

360
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,041
They say in Cuba.

361
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,531
Cuba!

362
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,724
He never set foot in North America
in his whole life.

363
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,924
He had <i>a</i> cistern truck.

364
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,689
A tanker. But not for carrying
wine or oil.

365
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,127
He carried people.
He'd fill it with people.

366
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,045
They'd give him their life savings
to take them to France.

367
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,363
Then he'd drop them off somewhere
in the middle of the night and say,

368
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,802
"You're in France. La France.
Take <i>a</i> hike."

369
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,524
France my ass.

370
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,887
They were still in Spain,
totally lost.

371
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,521
How about that!

372
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,886
The only decent thing he ever did
was enter the school when it was on fire

373
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,646
trying to save all the stuffed animals.

374
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,362
The first one he saved
was the fox.

375
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,846
Antonio knows it's his daughter
who gets them into trouble.

376
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,562
Antonio knows that with Adele dead,

377
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,405
his daughter is all he has
in this world.

378
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,086
Let me do that, Lucho.
You don't know how.

379
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,049
<i>You're a fisherman,
not a sea-blaster.</i>

380
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,965
This isn't rocket science, Antonio.

381
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,921
- Have to start sometime.
- The fuse is too short!

382
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,526
Pray for us.

383
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,728
- Holy Mother of God.
- Pray for us.

384
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,408
ORPHANAGE OF THE DIVINE SHEPHERDESS
SANLUCAR DE BARRAMEDA, CADIZ

385
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,131
- Mother of God.
- Pray for us.

386
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,765
Holy Mother of God.

387
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,485
Pray with me.

388
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,961
Pray for us.

389
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,200
Pray for us.

390
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,645
It's your last night.

391
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,850
Pray with me, son.

392
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,567
- Mother of Good Advice.
- Pray for us.

393
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,808
- Mother of the Creator.
- Pray for us.

394
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,327
- Father of the Savior.
- Pray for us.

395
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,847
- Mother of the Church.
- Pray for us.

396
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,163
You have to get up early tomorrow.

397
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,485
You have to take the first bus
or you'll miss the train.

398
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,731
Go to bed.

399
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,880
Good night, Mother.

400
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,846
Never forget to take your Uminal.

401
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,842
I'll send you the pills every month.

402
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:12,166
TWENTY YEARS LATER

403
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,365
Look, Mr. Malpica.

404
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,168
Her hands are working much better.

405
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,167
Her skin even looks younger

406
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,363
and her hands are lighter.

407
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,931
Good for sewing, right, Amparo?

408
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,851
Who will that be for?

409
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,361
For my son, when he's born.

410
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,487
Mother.

411
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,441
Can you hear me?

412
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,566
Do you know who am?

413
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,441
I'm Fins.

414
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,287
Fins?

415
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,167
Nice to meet you.

416
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,529
I'm naming my son Emilio.

417
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,160
My Lucho.

418
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,286
Lucho.

419
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,606
Lucho...

420
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,930
It's <i>a</i> nice name, Mother.

421
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,445
Hope you visit me.

422
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,160
I'll be working in Noitia.

423
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,011
Noitia, remember?

424
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,486
Noitia...

425
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,528
went there once.

426
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,610
To buy thread.

427
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,089
It was very, very hot.

428
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,521
Like before <i>a</i> storm.

429
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,646
What will you do there?

430
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,571
Secret stuff.

431
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,043
There's plenty of that going on.

432
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,006
Where are you, Fins?

433
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,087
Here.

434
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,405
Where?

435
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,369
At the teacher's desk.

436
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,846
Have you learned that much?

437
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,170
I've learned my share.

438
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,288
"All is silence," remember?

439
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,171
You laughed at me
when read you that poem.

440
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,566
But that's what it said.

441
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,411
"All is silence."

442
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,567
"Deafening silence."

443
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,526
That's what it said.

444
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,601
What about you?

445
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,770
Nothing to tell?

446
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,525
That you're still there.

447
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,886
In the ocean.

448
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,606
In the middle
of the fucking ocean, yeah.

449
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,807
Not <i>a</i> single letter in 20 years.

450
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,561
Well,

451
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,523
thought of you
more than you think.

452
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,166
Every day

453
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,485
All day lons?

454
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,881
Well, not me.

455
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,650
Learned to forget.

456
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,765
Every day!

457
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,166
Every hour.

458
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,440
Ripped up plenty of letters.

459
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,806
Letters?

460
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,201
You ripped up everything.

461
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,689
- I'm back.
- What?

462
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,366
I'm back.

463
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,561
Have <i>a</i> son.

464
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,246
He's Brinco's.

465
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,686
Know.

466
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,840
You know why  came here,
Fins Malpica?

467
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,691
To tell you never want
to see you again.

468
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,246
Don't call me,

469
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,211
don'! talk to me,

470
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,366
don'! look at me.

471
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,881
You got that?

472
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,845
Will he ever go to bed?

473
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,369
The bastards never sleep.

474
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,325
There might be <i>a</i> snitch.

475
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,802
Just someone busting balls.

476
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,249
The sergeant knows his place.

477
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,483
Tomorrow he'll show up asking for more
and we'll have to give it to him.

478
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,921
That's how the world works, Carburo.

479
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,686
You can'! rely on anyone.

480
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,321
Damn, Brinco. You're wasted.

481
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,285
- You're using your wrist, Chelin.
- Yeah, bullshit.

482
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,600
There you go.

483
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,928
Finally, let's get to it.

484
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,810
Okay, Carburo.
Time to conquer the West.

485
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,811
Let's go, boys.

486
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,684
Is everyone here?

487
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,891
Okay, gentlemen.

488
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:18,650
There are 25 ships with tobacco
in all of Europe.

489
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,201
Most are in the Mediterranean,

490
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,728
Greece, Italy,

491
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,689
Sicily, around here.

492
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,845
That's right.

493
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,567
Even along the coast
of some Communist countries.

494
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,449
They smoke too, of course.

495
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,129
And at this point...

496
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,809
what's our position?

497
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,291
You called, sir?

498
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,408
It's about time you called me
by my first name.

499
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,201
Yes, sir.

500
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,882
The sea brings only the finest.

501
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,202
Who needs fertilizer?

502
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,166
I've said that before.

503
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,247
Yes, sir.

504
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,611
We traditionalists
often repeat ourselves.

505
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,526
Brinco, you're my best driver.

506
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,565
That's what they say.

507
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,126
The best.

508
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,281
Carburo!

509
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,527
Go ahead!

510
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,646
Inverno, full speed ahead.

511
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,523
I've never given you anything, Brinco.

512
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,851
How's the boat, lnverno?

513
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,965
This isn't <i>a</i> boat, boss.

514
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,728
<i>It's a frigate, a flagship.
We could cross the Atlantic.</i>

515
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,605
The flagship is yours.

516
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,290
Don't worry about the papers,
it's in your mother's name.

517
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,923
Then we'll call her Sira.

518
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,680
Sure, that's very nice of you.
But in that case,

519
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,726
we'll call her Sira.

520
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,680
There will be more.

521
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,080
You're right.

522
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,840
There's an arms cache.

523
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,843
Something weird is going on.

524
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,883
- They're leaving.
- Follow them.

525
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,169
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.

526
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,205
Who is that?

527
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,366
It's Fins.

528
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,287
The bastard!

529
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,849
Come back in an hour, Monica.

530
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,127
In the alley, like <i>a</i> blur,

531
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,041
watching the corner...

532
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,121
You sure could sing tangos.

533
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,686
Remember?

534
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,807
The cannery supervisor
was always shouting,

535
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,487
"Keep singing! Keep singing!"
to keep all of you

536
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,404
from eating the mussels.

537
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,800
"Keep singing!"

538
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,451
How miserable!

539
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,121
Aren't you going to open it?

540
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,607
Go on, open it.

541
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,445
Silver anniversary, diamond ring.

542
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,161
25 years of marriage.

543
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,290
Hard to believe.

544
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,451
Do you need something?

545
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,282
Yes, need you to make

546
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,364
<i>a</i> few calls for me.

547
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,129
I'm expecting an urgent message.

548
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,765
How about dinner later?

549
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,451
A little seafood,

550
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,401
goose barnacles,

551
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,080
leche frita...

552
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,006
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

553
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,207
Is Domingo there?

554
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,006
He's asleep.
He worked all night.

555
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,006
Okay, I'll call back later.

556
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,881
Listen up.

557
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,964
Don't wait for Domingo.

558
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,806
He worked last night
and he's asleep.

559
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,764
You can work the "imos indo"
coordinates.

560
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,001
Have <i>a</i> good day.

561
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,242
The coast is clear, over.

562
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,484
Okay, we won't wait for Domingo,
over.

563
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,521
Santi!

564
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,610
Is Mr. Lima there?
It's urgent.

565
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,684
No, he isn't.
I'll give him the message.

566
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,689
Tell him it's from Domingo's wife.

567
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,171
Domingo went to work.

568
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,322
Domingo went to work.
It's urgent.

569
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,766
Understood.

570
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,447
Monica.

571
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,768
For the Marshal, personally.

572
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,810
Rock, paper, scissors.

573
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,841
One to nothing.

574
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,809
One to three, no cheating.

575
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,570
Rock, paper, scissors.

576
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,964
- Three to two.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

577
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,047
- Three to three.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

578
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,008
Leda!

579
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,446
What happened?

580
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,126
He's fine.
The eye doctor prescribed it.

581
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,442
Don't tell me you're cross-eyed.

582
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,887
It's called anmiopia.
He's anmiopic.

583
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,929
See? Cross-eyed, he says...

584
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,525
What <i>a</i> brute.

585
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,446
Anmi-what?

586
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,289
His eye is lazy. We have to cover
the good one to make it work.

587
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,880
- He looks good, huh?
- He looks great.

588
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,206
You look like <i>a</i> pirate.

589
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,321
- Wanna go for <i>a</i> walk with Uncle Chelin?
- Okay.

590
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,926
Let's go, kid.

591
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,530
Let's put that lazy eye to work.

592
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,530
Damn, the things that wash up...

593
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,606
Wait there.

594
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,722
I'll show you the second-most
important thing

595
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,524
<i>a</i> man needs to know.

596
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,925
This washed up too.

597
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,527
Come here.

598
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,486
Like this.

599
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,287
Gently.

600
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,961
Know what it's called?

601
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,288
What?

602
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,006
It's called Astra Llama.
Understand?

603
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,080
Cool, isn't it?

604
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,245
It washed up too?

605
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,687
Actually, it came from <i>a</i> dealer.

606
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,570
You know what <i>a</i> dealer is?

607
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,284
Sure you do.

608
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:04,002
A dealer is someone who works in
<i>a</i> casino dealing cards.

609
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,887
But there's another kind
of dealer too.

610
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,884
- A horse dealer.
- A horse dealer?

611
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,611
Yeah. We'll go see one some time,
you and me.

612
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,448
But don'! tell anyone.
It'll be our secret, okay?

613
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,489
Now aim straight.
Let's kill that fucking cow,

614
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,165
there's millions of them.

615
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,367
Ready?

616
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,363
Good. That eye is coming along great.

617
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,090
I'm sick of counting boats.

618
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,725
I'm sick of everything.

619
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,929
Especially the sofa.

620
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,128
My whole body feels like
imitation leather.

621
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,327
Don't worry.

622
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,449
You'll be living in
<i>a</i> mansion soon.

623
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,162
Oh, yeah?

624
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,727
What mansion?

625
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,325
Yours.

626
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,605
I'll take care of it.

627
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,087
You'll see.

628
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,806
How will you do it?

629
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,970
If were Marshal...

630
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,610
I'd pay off the head of customs.

631
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,649
What are you waiting for?

632
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,690
Fins Malpica.

633
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,041
What are you worth?

634
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,730
Don't say you have no price.

635
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,127
What about you?

636
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,926
What are you worth?

637
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,445
Dead, more than you.

638
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,371
What's <i>a</i> dead cop worth?

639
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,843
We're cheap. They give you

640
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,406
<i>a</i> medal...

641
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,930
and <i>a</i> few lines in the paper.

642
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:58,569
You want medals? We'll buy you some.
You want lines in the paper? Fine.

643
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,644
We'll buy reporters, anything you want.
But you're not being honest.

644
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,127
Why not?

645
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,164
Because everything has <i>a</i> price.

646
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,005
Be nice.

647
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,961
- Still have your absences?
- No, no.

648
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,811
Almost never.

649
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,322
With all the money you'd make

650
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,920
you could spend your time

651
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,646
taking photos,
since you like it so much.

652
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,967
We have people everywhere.

653
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,289
You took this one of me at the airport
in Oporto, with Mendoza.

654
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,410
It was an interesting trip.

655
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,765
But you already know that.

656
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,930
Sure, do.

657
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,290
You didn't take this one.

658
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,007
Not this one.

659
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,120
With my friend Pablo Escobar
in Medellin.

660
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,566
Look at his face.

661
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:13,045
He was happy because somebody
just gave him Bonnie and Clyde's oar.

662
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,250
It's historic.

663
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,406
This is my favorite.

664
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,210
This one you did take of me.

665
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,441
Gave my wife quite <i>a</i> ride
that day.

666
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,247
Yes, sir. You can keep it.

667
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,328
- Don'! want it.
- Keep it.

668
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,808
When you decide on your price,
any price,

669
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,451
write it on the back.

670
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,082
We're destined to befriends,

671
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,207
asshole.

672
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,970
Heard you wrote <i>a</i> report

673
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,531
that's like <i>a</i> novel.

674
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,045
A very good one, by the way.

675
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,845
They even gave you an alias:
Simenon.

676
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,571
A good review ruins any good book.

677
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,610
They'll bury it, you'll see.

678
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,610
Well, loved it.

679
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,691
Especially when you say,

680
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,320
"Your Honor,"

681
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,925
in Noita,

682
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:26,971
"true power is exercised
in darkness and silence."

683
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,689
- Damn.
- Bravo, seriously.

684
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,805
You sound like an anarchist.

685
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,289
There's <i>a</i> storm
coming in tomorrow, Sira.

686
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,280
We should go

687
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,240
somewhere together some time.

688
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,210
There are some wonderful places, Sira.

689
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,485
You always wanted to go to Lisbon,
know.

690
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:43,168
We've been singing fados
all our lives

691
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,363
and we've never been to Lisbon.

692
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,365
What <i>a</i> disaster!

693
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,846
We've never even gone to Madrid.

694
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,203
Could take you to <i>a</i> nice hotel.

695
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,730
The Palace, the cinema,
the opera...

696
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:17,841
To the Prado Museum, Sira.

697
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,570
It never occurred to me

698
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,770
to enter the Prado Museum,

699
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,400
but that's where the Italians
always want to meet.

700
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,525
Thought, "What <i>a</i> marvel, Sira."

701
01:04:55,800 --> 01:05:00,727
Museums are the most wonderful places
in the world.

702
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,809
Better than natural landscapes,

703
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,406
better than Niagara Falls.

704
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:08,723
I'm telling you,
always the same temperature.

705
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,884
The ideal climate.

706
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,448
Because of the paintings.

707
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:17,360
They must be kept
at <i>a</i> constant temperature.

708
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,605
Paintings are very delicate,

709
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,925
more so than people.

710
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,082
Sira,

711
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,966
sweetheart,
tell me what you're thinking.

712
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,604
Please, give me all the nasty stuff.

713
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,328
Insult me, darling.

714
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,608
Go on, call me arrogant.

715
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,650
Cocky bastard, son of <i>a</i> bitch,

716
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:53,046
captain of industry, entrepreneur,

717
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,802
Beelzebub, beast,

718
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,970
piece of shit!

719
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,161
Say it!

720
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,321
For God's sake, Sira!

721
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,531
You went silent.

722
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,926
What are you thinking?

723
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:19,123
Have an opinion,
but it hasn't reached my head yet.

724
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,404
The legend of the fastest driver
in the Atlantic is over.

725
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,005
You're the boss now.

726
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,889
You'll have to watch your back.

727
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,886
That's why they hired you.

728
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,562
Exactly, to watch your back.

729
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,051
Among other things.

730
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,287
We have <i>a</i> long trip ahead of us.

731
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,650
You should see the old man.

732
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,883
See him every day.

733
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,689
He's my favorite ghost.

734
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,969
You're like <i>a</i> son to him, Brinco.

735
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,087
A son?

736
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,242
Mendoza,

737
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:57,643
if I'm going to be your boss,
spare me the soap opera.

738
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,762
You got it?

739
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,722
If your speech doesn't please the boss,
give him another.

740
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,569
I'll prepare another one for you.

741
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,165
Where are you from, Detective?

742
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,963
Was born here, sir.
In Noitia.

743
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,800
Your parents live here?

744
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,049
My father died <i>a</i> long time ago.

745
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,809
- He died at sea.
- I'm sorry.

746
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,448
A stick of dynamite blew up
in his hand.

747
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,049
- Wow.
- Yeah.

748
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,567
My mother's alive,
but has memory problems.

749
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,570
Alzheimer's is awful.

750
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,245
My mother had it too.

751
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,331
She confused me with the weather man.
She'd kiss him whenever he came on.

752
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,561
Damn.

753
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,084
This is embarrassing.

754
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,563
Want to speak to your superior
right away.

755
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,051
- Right away.
- Yes.

756
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,850
Who are you, the Generalissimo?

757
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,845
No, Lieutenant Colonel Party Peeper.

758
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,684
Yes, sir, Lieutenant Colonel, sir!

759
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,086
Holy shit!

760
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,960
The lark!

761
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,764
Where the hell is the lark?

762
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:08,331
It came straight from customs, boss.
It was sealed.

763
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:09,921
Sealed?

764
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,291
I'll seal your balls
if don'! get my lark.

765
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,601
Who has it?

766
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,688
Take it easy, Brinco.
People are watching.

767
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,481
Can get you

768
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,002
<i>a</i> Rolls emblem.
The spirit of ecstasy.

769
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:26,324
Stick your spirit of ecstasy
up your ass. want my lark, okay?

770
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,005
You know what <i>a</i> lark is?

771
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,650
- Yes.
- Do you?

772
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,241
Yes, do.

773
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,246
Didn't until the Cuban bastard
who sold me the car showed me.

774
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,448
And want it. want it.

775
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,761
Want it.

776
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,361
This car isn't the same
without the bird.

777
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:51,602
What's this?

778
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,527
Damn, Brinco.

779
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:03,167
- You can'! move it with your wrist.
- What? It's energy.

780
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,010
Yeah, right.

781
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,166
Three.

782
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,170
Have you seen Leda?

783
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,004
Give them <i>a</i> bottle of champagne.

784
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,281
Mendoza.

785
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,491
Have you seen Leda?

786
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,045
No, haven't.

787
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,961
Where were you?

788
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,403
Sorry, got tied up at home.

789
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,608
Such <i>a</i> beautiful woman
needn't apologize.

790
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,531
Want you here with me, damn it.
I'll be right back.

791
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,846
Yes, Miss, but tell me.

792
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,525
What was it

793
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,330
that sunk the Titanic?

794
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,122
No, not the fucking block of ice.

795
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,200
Greed.

796
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,920
Man wants to be God, but...

797
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:39,045
he's just <i>a</i> worm. That's right.
An inebriated worm

798
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,845
who thinks he owns
the fishing hook.

799
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,569
Marshal, sir, rumor has it...

800
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:46,644
Did you write down the thing
about the worm, God and the hook?

801
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,643
Yes, Marshal, sir.

802
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:53,171
Your name comes up often
as future mayor or even senator.

803
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:54,921
Gentlemen,

804
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,690
I'd like to say <i>a</i> few words
before speaking.

805
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,843
Miss, won't beat around the bush.

806
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,684
Politicians are assholes.

807
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,725
Scumbags.

808
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,400
Plenty of campaign promises...
Excuse me.

809
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,442
Did you write that?
No, don'! write that.

810
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,400
Write this. I'm apolitical.
Absolutely apolitical.

811
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,006
Absolutely.

812
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,880
But write this too.

813
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,410
As Marshal

814
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,449
promise

815
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,525
to sacrifice myself for Noitia.
That's right, sacrifice myself.

816
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:36,406
And to fight for freedom. The freedom
to create wealth, not destroy it.

817
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,849
To work and make <i>a</i> living
with our own hands.

818
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,326
Like we've always done.

819
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,127
All right.

820
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,489
How did your fortune begin?

821
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:51,010
Estrictu sensu, with culture.

822
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,489
Yes, with culture.

823
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,126
Cinema, dancing,

824
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,405
hamburgers...

825
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,570
Nobody here had ever eaten one.

826
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,965
Look, Miss.

827
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:07,567
Nobody's ever given me anything.
I'll tell you the truth.

828
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,364
Believed in Noitia all along.
All along.

829
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,122
And I'm going to rebuild it.

830
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,407
Work is love, that's my program.

831
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,609
Conserving the landscape
is the latest fad. Great.

832
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,889
What will we eat?
The landscape?

833
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:29,049
Write that down, please.
The part about eating the landscape.

834
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,808
It's <i>a</i> good metaphor.

835
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,886
It's not a metaphor.
told you, I'm apolitical.

836
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,840
Say what think. Look,
there are two kinds of politicians.

837
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,725
They're either crazy
or they can'! see

838
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,207
what's right in front of them.

839
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,042
I'm not here to sing
Christmas carols.

840
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,211
What office will you run for?

841
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,128
Whichever one win, obviously.

842
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:57,130
Miss, my party is Noitia.
like our way of life.

843
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,929
Religion, family, festivals...

844
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,848
If that bothers people,

845
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,365
to hell with them.

846
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,491
But strange things
are happening in Noitia.

847
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,762
Do you approve of smuggling, sir?

848
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,771
They say the drug trade
is casting its nets here.

849
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,051
Its nets?

850
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,326
Did you know
that you catch more fish

851
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,847
if you take <i>a</i> woman hunchback

852
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,891
on your boat
and she pees on the nets?

853
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,009
That's reality.
The rest is fantasy.

854
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:39,568
Write that down, please.
This is information.

855
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,246
Is that clear?

856
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,401
Look, Miss...

857
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,682
Lucia.

858
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,171
Okay, Lucia.

859
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,448
I'll tell you what really think.

860
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,883
Smugglers are people with honor.

861
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,084
They earn their money...

862
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,126
At least in Noitia,
they earn it by working.

863
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,362
Who do they hurt, the tax office?

864
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,569
Fine, I'm willing to admit it.

865
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,047
But the tax office doesn't have kids
and grandparents to feed.

866
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,444
You didn't mention the drug trade.

867
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,449
For God's sake, what can say
about the drug trade

868
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,365
that anybody in Noitia
can'! tell you?

869
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,403
What will say

870
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,484
is that if I'm mayor,

871
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:26,484
I'll put away the drug addicts.

872
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,561
It's funny. People are talking
<i>a</i> lot about organized crime.

873
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:35,725
Your paper does it.
Well, if crime is so organized,

874
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,565
the government has to be
even more organized.

875
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:42,611
Because there are some
very bad people out there.

876
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,725
That we know.

877
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,487
So let's all contribute

878
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,608
to organizing the government

879
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,370
properly..

880
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,602
- What about...?
- lpso facto, Miss.

881
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,046
Hello, son.

882
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,886
Hi.

883
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,320
This is the first interview
I've granted.

884
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,881
Hope it's not your last.

885
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,289
Add <i>a</i> little criticism.

886
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:12,723
Saying nice things about people
is the best way to sink them.

887
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,002
- Aren't you...?
- I'm nobody.

888
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,531
Can take <i>a</i> photo?

889
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:20,007
Of course, of course you can.

890
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,811
Never sell <i>a</i> gentleman short.

891
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:27,965
One question.

892
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,400
With or without the hat?

893
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,164
- With the hat.
- With the hat.

894
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,446
Even better.

895
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,169
If it's good,
the paper will sell out.

896
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,441
What if it's bad?

897
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,325
It'll sell out anyway.

898
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,846
"Smugglers are people with honor."

899
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:53,801
That's balls for you.

900
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,407
There you have it.

901
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:58,564
A masterpiece to include
in your secret report.

902
01:16:58,720 --> 01:16:59,846
A secret report

903
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,685
which right now  have to say
is vex populi.

904
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,922
Take no offense, look.

905
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:09,329
Noitia's football team is touring
America with Brinco as president.

906
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,680
Spectacular.

907
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:13,081
A modest team leading the league

908
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:17,250
with its captain, in this case,
Chelin, the new head coach,

909
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,961
an expert consumer of narcotics.

910
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,121
Okay, won't bother you
any more.

911
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:27,011
You can get back to work,
but one thing.

912
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:31,245
Feathers are going to fly
tomorrow at dawn.

913
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,126
See you later.

914
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,125
Go suck an egg, Grimaldo!

915
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,248
Tell them what you know,
why don'! you?

916
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,884
He's rotten to the bone.

917
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,641
He should be the one
writing this report.

918
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,760
That's all of them.

919
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,647
Every single one.

920
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,963
- They sold out.
- told you.

921
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,490
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

922
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,922
Lieutenant Colonel,
this is Mara Doval.

923
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:11,161
She's our language expert.

924
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,443
And she has an amazing memory.
She remembers everything.

925
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,601
Well...

926
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,890
Okay, let's hear it.

927
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,084
Is Mr. Lima there?
It's urgent.

928
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:24,646
No, he isn't.
I'll give him the message.

929
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,886
Tell him it's from Domingo's wife.
Domingo went to work.

930
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,481
Domingo went to work.
It's urgent.

931
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,887
Understood.

932
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,206
Explain, Fins.

933
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,124
- Who are we listening to?
- Yeah.

934
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,691
The woman calling is Leda.

935
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,291
Leda Ortas.

936
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,606
<i>She has a son with Brinco,
a legendary speed boat driver</i>

937
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,570
who's gaining power
in the organization.

938
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:50,163
Leda's role is to spy on
the customs boats.

939
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,320
She calls the hair salon
run by Guadalupe,

940
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,400
Mr. Lima's wife,
officially-speaking.

941
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,800
And Mr. Lima is the Marshal.

942
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,209
Right. And who's this Domingo?

943
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,840
Domingo is captain
of the customs patrol.

944
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,571
Damn! These things still happen?

945
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:12,410
They don't need <i>a</i> look-out. They
hired the head of customs directly.

946
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,250
But we're getting lucky.

947
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:16,766
This is unprecedented.

948
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,967
Some notes in the Marshal's
handwriting.

949
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,409
An unexpected collaboration.

950
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:27,005
Impossible.

951
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,202
The bitch waited quietly
for 25 years,

952
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,603
like <i>a</i> dead cat,
to stick it to me!

953
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,927
Hi, Brenda.

954
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,122
Hi.

955
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:47,240
You know what?
Guadalupe isn't coming.

956
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,167
What do you mean?
Until when?

957
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,244
How should know?
She's not coming, period.

958
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:54,607
Don'! understand.

959
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,725
It's easy to understand.

960
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,167
She's not here.

961
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,810
She's gone.

962
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,406
She's never coming back.
Now do you understand?

963
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,287
Here.

964
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,445
A message for you.

965
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,727
A valuable one.

966
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,611
10,000 euros.

967
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:17,681
Listen, Monica.

968
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,520
Since you got here,

969
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,205
you haven'! seen anything,

970
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,965
you haven'! heard anything,

971
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,929
you don'! remember anything,
do you?

972
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,685
No. No.

973
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,085
I'm very sorry, Marshal, sir.

974
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,570
She's been dead for six hours.

975
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:45,605
What condition is the body in?

976
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:48,604
Nothing visible, sir.
Not <i>a</i> scratch.

977
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,731
It's surprising given the waves,
the rocks...

978
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,204
No signs of violence either.

979
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,843
It's clear she drowned.
She must have fallen in the water.

980
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:03,090
The sea is treacherous, Guadalupe.
told you that.

981
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,246
Always told her that.

982
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,371
LORD BYRON MEDITATING ON
GREECE'S FREEDOM

983
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,722
Sir, we have fresh news.

984
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,167
Operation Noitia begins tonight.

985
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:27,203
Carburo, you win at pool
by scaring the balls.

986
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,888
Whoever it is, I'm not here.

987
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:34,967
Yes?

988
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,611
Yes, sir. He's right here.

989
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,243
Viriato wants to say hi.

990
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,211
Yes?

991
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:57,486
Thank you.

992
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,650
Thanks for the invitation.

993
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,723
Carburo, we're going to Portugal.

994
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,161
We need to cross the border
before nightfall.

995
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:15,123
Your shipwreck lady
looks beautiful tonight.

996
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,162
Don'! recognize the other two.

997
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,280
The prodigious memory reporting:

998
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:25,046
He's manager of a bank branch

999
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,722
with <i>a</i> sudden
and unusual interest

1000
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:30,963
in Noitia's transactions with Panama
and the Cayman Islands.

1001
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:37,321
She just opened <i>a</i> jewelry store
and one month ago she was broke.

1002
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,963
You really think people will buy
600 houses on the coast of Noitia?

1003
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,889
Multiply by three.

1004
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,923
Multiply what by three?

1005
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,729
- Everything.
- Everything?

1006
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,086
Everything.

1007
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,131
What are you taking?

1008
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,161
- Garlic pills.
- Give me one.

1009
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,561
They're not garlic pills.

1010
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,690
Don'! care, give me one.

1011
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,610
Have <i>a</i> little problem,

1012
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:12,921
since was <i>a</i> kid.

1013
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,249
It's <i>a</i> variation of epilepsy.

1014
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,451
It had stopped, but...

1015
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,806
it's back.

1016
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,920
They used to call it "absences".

1017
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:26,207
Absences.

1018
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,246
Okay, well...

1019
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,486
even more reason.

1020
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,802
Want to try being absent
with you.

1021
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,208
COMPLIMENTS OF VIRIATO

1022
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:48,167
Look how lucky.
It's on the house.

1023
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,208
Excuse me,
I'm going to the bathroom.

1024
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,930
We would have paid for it.

1025
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,201
You can pay for the drinks.

1026
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,450
I'm going to the man's room.

1027
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,246
What are you doing?

1028
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:24,681
Let you live since you got here,
but swear you're <i>a</i> dead man.

1029
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,290
Who do you think you are?

1030
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:35,005
Never touch me again, bastard!

1031
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,447
You're still cleaning barrels!
You smell like crap!

1032
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,965
Coffins won't do it this time!

1033
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,811
- You smell like crap!
- Son of <i>a</i> bitch! Not any more!

1034
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,291
Let him go, Fins!

1035
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,326
That's why you came back!

1036
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,131
What are you going to do,
shoot me?

1037
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,601
Will she?

1038
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,086
Get in the car!

1039
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,523
A total of 36 people

1040
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,648
were arrested last night

1041
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,970
charged with belonging to <i>a</i> ring
of smugglers and drug traffickers

1042
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:20,521
as part of "Operation Noitia."

1043
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,046
Searches performed by police

1044
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,406
have resulted in the seizure

1045
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,324
of large quantities of drugs,

1046
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:30,370
cash and some weapons.

1047
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:33,683
We've hit the tobacco smugglers hard

1048
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,571
as they move onto drug trafficking.

1049
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:40,167
This is much more than <i>a</i> warning.
Society

1050
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:44,405
should be at ease. The criminals
are the ones who should be uneasy.

1051
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:49,722
Told you, Spanish TV
comes in great here.

1052
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,251
We got screwed.

1053
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,121
Big time.

1054
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,405
What happened, Detective?

1055
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:02,041
You'll hear about it shortly.
Please...

1056
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,129
- They're letting them go.
- What?

1057
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,886
On bail for peanuts.
can'! believe it.

1058
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,043
You know who was there
to help them?

1059
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,400
- Who?
- Rh negative.

1060
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,403
- Rh...?
- From the Supreme Court.

1061
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,366
They let him go!

1062
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,841
- Can'! believe it.
- There's no way.

1063
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,244
Gentlemen, this is good news
for Noitia.

1064
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,283
My client, our friend Brinco,
has been released.

1065
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,608
How do you feel
after this experience?

1066
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,050
Fine, fine.

1067
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,726
Better than the people
who arrested me, think.

1068
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:51,930
Slept great,

1069
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,525
but tonight I'll sleep even better.

1070
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,805
That kid is history.

1071
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:01,446
Are you sure?

1072
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:05,722
He's being taken care of.

1073
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,685
Milton's two thirds.

1074
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:13,405
Who's the messenger?

1075
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,086
Okay, okay.

1076
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,362
How's Leda? Is she okay?

1077
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,521
She's fine.

1078
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:27,130
Lost track of them, that's all.
I'm on it.

1079
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:30,286
Set up another drop off.
have the coordinates.

1080
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,607
It's all taken care of.
Don't worry, Brinco. Trust me.

1081
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:38,323
The payment will be delivered
to your door step. For your trouble.

1082
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,447
You're not using again...

1083
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,762
- What?
- Are you?

1084
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:43,371
- No, no.
- Come on, Chelin.

1085
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:45,960
I'm not using again!

1086
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,770
Trust me, okay? Trust me.

1087
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:50,605
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

1088
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:58,165
- Fix it and call me.
- Okay.

1089
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,084
They've got you by the balls.

1090
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:25,841
Okay.

1091
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,001
You already know
this is Leda's new house.

1092
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:32,128
I'll settle for the bed.

1093
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,291
But tonight we have <i>a</i> surprise
for Santi.

1094
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,521
Follow me.

1095
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:08,171
You wanted <i>a</i> friend, didn't you?

1096
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:10,170
Did you or didn't you?

1097
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,286
You sure?

1098
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:14,527
Look.

1099
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,488
There's <i>a</i> friend for you.

1100
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:29,531
Okay, Brinco.

1101
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:33,163
Just to show you that your friends
do things for you too.

1102
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:34,401
Look.

1103
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:44,449
Know I'm outside,

1104
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,126
but the day  die,

1105
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,170
know you'll have to cry.

1106
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,085
Cry and cry.

1107
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,965
Cry and cry.

1108
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:59,124
You'll say you didn't love me,

1109
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:02,762
but you'll be very sad,

1110
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,126
and that's how you'll stay.

1111
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:11,805
With money or without,

1112
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:15,369
always do as please

1113
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:21,201
and my word is the law.

1114
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:27,767
Have no throne or queen...

1115
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:32,410
Leda! Where are you going?

1116
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,571
To dress up as <i>a</i> hooker.

1117
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,688
Don't be silly, listen to me.

1118
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,325
I'll bring you luck again.

1119
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,085
Remember when we looked
for treasure?

1120
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:43,171
Discovered something.
discovered

1121
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,288
that they only exist in the ocean.

1122
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,250
That's where shipwrecks
and the dead are kept.

1123
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,368
You have to look in the ocean.

1124
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,481
Come on, say it with me.

1125
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:56,009
"Ocean."

1126
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:08,082
I'll show you my second-favorite
thing to do in the world.

1127
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:23,291
Nobody's given me anything
this special in <i>a</i> while.

1128
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:48,326
What's wrong, baby?

1129
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:54,248
Everyone's asking for you
downstairs.

1130
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:55,686
You disappeared.

1131
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,322
Wish could.

1132
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,163
You should have said
you were bringing <i>a</i> harem

1133
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,402
- of hookers to my house.
- No, no.

1134
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,164
They're employees of our club.

1135
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:11,481
Our club?

1136
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:12,641
Yeah.

1137
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,124
You disgust me talking like that.

1138
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,286
Disgust you?

1139
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,362
You mark them like cattle.

1140
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,209
How much did that one cost you?

1141
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,206
Which one, Leda?

1142
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,409
Which one, damn it?

1143
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:40,571
Don'! know who she is.

1144
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,809
They all cost the same.

1145
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:45,327
One Bible.

1146
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:56,687
What?

1147
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:00,968
- Have to go to Greece. Help me.
- Greece?

1148
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:02,641
What for?

1149
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,604
I've always wanted to go.

1150
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,205
Okay, fine.

1151
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:09,724
Give me the money
and have <i>a</i> nice trip.

1152
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:11,882
There's no money.
They tricked me.

1153
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:13,929
They were another gang
impersonating ours.

1154
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:15,964
What bullshit is this?

1155
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,924
Need your help!
They're coming after me!

1156
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:20,241
You can go to hell!

1157
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,731
Where the fuck are you?

1158
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,245
Where are you, damn it?

1159
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,006
Chelin...

1160
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:07,281
ls something wrong?

1161
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,645
No, nothing.

1162
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:13,528
Nothing?

1163
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,771
My routine.

1164
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:20,971
You can'! go up there.

1165
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:33,647
What are you doing?

1166
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,848
I'm buying her freedom!

1167
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,929
If your pussy can work miracles,
raise the price, you got it?

1168
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,644
That's how the fucking world works!

1169
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:47,566
Go to the football field if you have
the balls! Don't touch me!

1170
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,641
Leda!

1171
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,485
For God's sake...

1172
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:41,209
Chumbo, no distractions!

1173
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:44,645
Everyone's worried about
the shipwreck lady.

1174
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:47,966
Mom, should swim?

1175
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:49,451
Swim, swim!

1176
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,365
Mom, should dive?

1177
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:29,482
Santi!

1178
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:30,927
Santi!

1179
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,242
How long did hold my breath?

1180
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,649
How long can hold my breath?

1181
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:47,561
Hurry, Leda!

1182
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:48,767
Santi, come quick!

1183
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,365
Chumbo! Chumbo!

1184
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:52,446
Hurry!

1185
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,891
Every year, lnverno and Chumbo

1186
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:22,522
gave their donations to Our Lady
of the Sea, the Virgin of Carmen.

1187
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:26,891
And it was lnverno who paid for
the new bell.

1188
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:31,206
It's fitting to ring it now
in this requiem.

1189
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:53,850
God is light.

1190
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:55,606
He sees everything.

1191
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:59,209
What to be thankful for
and what to punish.

1192
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:03,328
Remember this.
Let it guide your course.

1193
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:06,007
In summary,

1194
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,688
God isn't as dumb as we think.

1195
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:12,966
May lnverno and Chumbo
rest in peace.

1196
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:15,360
And pray also for Chelin,

1197
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,443
who lived the life of <i>a</i> dead man.

1198
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:37,205
The religious ceremony is over,
Marshal, sir.

1199
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,169
Now you can carry out His will.

1200
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:42,401
Don't like the party
you're planning.

1201
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:43,641
This is sacred ground.

1202
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:46,371
Just <i>a</i> little tribute, Marcelo.

1203
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:48,250
The music they liked.

1204
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:51,565
<i>In Noitia, a funeral used to be
a funeral</i>

1205
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,489
<i>and a party was a party.</i>

1206
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,763
I'm leaving, my work here is done.

1207
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,131
Your work, thank God,
is never done.

1208
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:00,890
You have to protect us.

1209
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,724
We're your flock.

1210
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:13,411
Marcelo, let's meet some time
and talk about Unamuno!

1211
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:34,410
Know I'm outside,

1212
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,408
but the day  die

1213
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,400
you'll have to cry.

1214
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:43,531
Cry and cry.

1215
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:46,604
Cry and cry.

1216
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,410
You'll say you didn't love me...

1217
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,361
Do you trust me, Fins?

1218
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:54,970
Your silence worries me.

1219
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:58,009
Go ahead, Grimaldo.

1220
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,281
Look.

1221
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:06,441
This is the Mino River,

1222
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,046
the Tui Bridge...

1223
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,280
Here, in northern Portugal,
this Sunday,

1224
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:13,767
there's <i>a</i> meeting.
A very important one.

1225
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:15,166
Very few people,

1226
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:16,560
but very select.

1227
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:18,849
You should take <i>a</i> look.

1228
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,281
Why are you telling me this?

1229
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,571
Got two pieces of news
from the doctor today.

1230
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,370
The first was very bad.
have cancer.

1231
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:32,890
But the other was wonderful.

1232
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:34,686
The disease...

1233
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,480
will kill me very quickly.

1234
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:23,120
How was the funeral?

1235
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:26,090
I've seen better.

1236
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:27,486
The priest and the mariachis...

1237
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:29,920
weren't bad.

1238
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:34,881
Brinco,

1239
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,251
Lieutenant Colonel Alisal

1240
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:41,769
has been arrested.
Our people are dropping like flies.

1241
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:47,168
I'll have to disappear
for <i>a</i> while.

1242
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,849
Go somewhere far away, son.

1243
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:00,526
Hell, for example.

1244
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:06,561
If you can, even further.

1245
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:09,201
Brinco!

1246
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:17,170
They always brought you luck.

1247
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,490
Why didn't you go with him?

1248
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:25,883
You should take your son
away from here.

1249
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,810
Something bad might happen.

1250
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,240
He didn't ask me.

1251
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,564
Can find out where he is
if you want.

1252
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:44,400
Is it true you can'! type

1253
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:45,891
without looking at the keys?

1254
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,525
What does that matter?

1255
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:53,482
I'd like you to write
<i>a</i> letter for me.

1256
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:57,721
To make up for all the letters
you never sent me.

1257
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:06,163
There are people
who have never gotten <i>a</i> letter.

1258
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:09,361
Come on.

1259
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,848
Close your eyes and I'll dictate.

1260
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,723
Have no paper, Leda.

1261
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,041
Good.

1262
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,928
Like the sound of the keys.

1263
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:22,645
My dear friend,

1264
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,207
now all is "silence."

1265
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:32,280
- Did you spell it with an?
- Yes.

1266
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:33,362
Good.

1267
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,531
How did it go?

1268
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,402
"Now all is solitude,"

1269
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:42,326
pain... II

1270
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:45,961
No. Don't write that.

1271
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,206
Wasn't going to.

1272
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:02,006
Bastards!

1273
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:04,127
Die!

1274
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:07,921
Leda, run!

1275
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:48,006
It's burning, see?

1276
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:51,891
Yeah, can see.

1277
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,162
Can see it's burning.

1278
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:09,882
Should we put out the fire?

1279
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:11,770
Why are you asking me?

1280
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:15,171
Have to decide
if the fire gets put out?

1281
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:17,966
Who am?

1282
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:19,566
Who?

1283
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:47,530
Is anyone still inside?

1284
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:49,961
Nobody.

1285
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,085
What's in the suitcase?

1286
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:23,570
Nothing, my things.

1287
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,691
Memories.
