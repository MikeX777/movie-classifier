1
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,992
No, no...

2
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,959
Look, over there!

3
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,519
Go home
and sleep it off.

4
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,871
Let me go! You're heavily drunk.

5
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,111
If you must throw up,
then it's into the drunk tank!

6
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,437
(Latin)"Now I clearly see
the destiny of Carthage!"

7
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,393
So speak Danish, man!

8
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,116
"Now I clearly see
the destiny of Carthage!"

9
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:49,026
STOLEN SPRING

10
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,557
Come in.

11
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,513
So ...

12
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,553
No, are you now lying
and working again!

13
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,117
Now you must stop
the disgusting habit, Edward.

14
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,711
A judge can't sit
and bite your fingernails in court.

15
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,559
What would the criminals think?

16
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,149
You must be careful
not to be cold, Edward.

17
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,993
Better turn off the light now ...
you must be rested for the party tomorrow.

18
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,954
- Yes, mother.
- Sleep well, my boy.

19
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,037
Good night, Mom.

20
00:05:25,313 --> 00:05:27,893
AKSEL NIELSEN
Careers adviser

21
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:32,740
I know, Nikolaj isn't particular academic, -

22
00:05:32,402 --> 00:05:34,516
- but he really wants to be
together with his comrades.

23
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,794
That I have understood.
The problem is, that his ...

24
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,278
... what shall we say ...
free manner to be -

25
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,269
- drag the class' level in a direction,
that isn't in nobody's interest.

26
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,952
We might explore the possibility
of some extra lessons!

27
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,153
Let's hold on
in our decision.

28
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,069
At a folk high school
Nikolaj can make his theater -

29
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,317
- and continue working at his poems.

30
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,752
We can't keep
him longer at the school.

31
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,273
- A judge Ellerstr?m  is waiting ...
- We are in fact finished.

32
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,994
- He has been sitting here for 35 years.
- Well ... and what has it turned to?

33
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,109
Come, come ...

34
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,593
Voila ...

35
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,873
This table is taken.
It's my table, gentlemen.

36
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,436
Can't you recognize us, Mogensen?

37
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,677
It's us ...
Ellerstr?m and Nielsen.

38
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,077
From the school!

39
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,953
The Black Hand.

40
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,189
Manus nigra ...

41
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,036
Edward Ellerstr?m.

42
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,358
How is it going
with the clarinet, Mr. Judge?

43
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,755
It was more the law.

44
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,715
And Aksel Nielsen. One has become
senior master at the old school ...

45
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,436
And the hair has fallen
of the literary man.

46
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,793
You know, you have an
anniversary this year ...

47
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,949
A kind of anniversary.
We must see the old boys again.

48
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,834
It would probably be
a sad sight.

49
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,511
Mikael, we'll
get you a dinner jacket.

50
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,270
We can't be without
you and your nasty cracks.

51
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,400
One isn't intended to play penguin.

52
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,756
Come on, boys!

53
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,189
Up the stairs ...

54
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,750
Ellerstr?m, Mogensen
and Nielsen in front.

55
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,834
The first step there ...

56
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,198
The rest stays like this!

57
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,517
And then Thygesen seems to stay here.

58
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,871
So there must be plenty of place.

59
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,112
Oh yes, we're missing Thygesen!

60
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,189
Well, Thygesen, was you
then get married in Bangkok?

61
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,474
Married! Rather two at 16
than one at the 32.

62
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,110
- Sorry.
- Not at all.

63
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,159
Yes?

64
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,115
What is it now? I don't care,
they have damn just to pay in time!

65
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,229
I've been grateful -

66
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,876
- for associate Blomme's
qualified latin teaching.

67
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,833
I remember him with gratitude.

68
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,873
One remember him
almost as sadist.

69
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,949
Sucking pieces of barley sugar day in and
day out, without he offering one a piece.

70
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,548
He took poison, right?

71
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,708
- God knows, what he did.
- Maybe he was poisoned.

72
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,870
Spicy thinking ...
One of us is perhaps a murderer.

73
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,753
Quite boring, we're damn not.

74
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,799
- A little more meat?
- One don't eat corpses.

75
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,750
- A little more meat?
- Thank you very much.

76
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,197
- More meat?
- Yes, finally.

77
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,273
A few days ago, there was spring
cleaning at home with us, -

78
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,359
- and what emerged
to the light:

79
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,438
My old student's cap.

80
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,720
I watched it,
and the memories rushed over me.

81
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,796
The Utopia of childhood.
The Lost Paradise.

82
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,357
When we stood like flowers
at the paradise meadows.

83
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,833
Ingemann.

84
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,909
And I thought of the old school
and all the wonderful memories.

85
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,873
Not at least, associate Blomme ...

86
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,630
Today we're sitting here
scattered for all winds.

87
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,277
Each of us fills
his place in the society -

88
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,439
- and probably no little place ...

89
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,200
But one thing binds us together, -

90
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,791
- and it's the memory
of our fine, old school.

91
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,552
Back in our youth, when the world
was bright and blue and pure, -

92
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,637
- then it was heaven on earth.

93
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,878
Oehlenschl?ger ... "The Golden Horns".

94
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,392
Then we learned discipline,
order and obedience,

95
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,993
- virtues that we again today
see the youth professes to.

96
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,997
Oh ...

97
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,440
We could evoke
this state forward again.

98
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,676
Could we force the nature.

99
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,759
Could we turn the worlds
large clock back, -

100
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,668
- could we turn
the flow of time.

101
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,837
Could we exorcise the universe.

102
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,117
Give us the childhood again.

103
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,269
Take us back to
Utopia of the childhood.

104
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,231
Nonsense! Mikael Mogensen
come with the fingers.

105
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,556
- Aksel Nielsen, may we hear?
- It wasn't, what we had got for homework.

106
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,240
You must learn your things!

107
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,431
I will ensure -

108
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,712
- that you end up as
shoemakers and road sweepers.

109
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,593
Ellerstr?m, will you please?

110
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,508
Excuse, it wasn't,
what we had got for homework.

111
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,718
One don't read, while one are eating, Edvard.
Then one have no use of the food.

112
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,558
You told me yesterday,
that you had learned it.

113
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,071
Hurry up, otherwise you're
getting too late again.

114
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,397
Come here.

115
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,633
So!

116
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,795
That's it!

117
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,470
- Aksel ...
- There was one left.

118
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,916
- Behave now properly.
- Yes yes.

119
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,671
Thank you.

120
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,033
When two secants intersect ...

121
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,754
What's the product? Come!

122
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,758
The product
of the one secant's side ...

123
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,661
... And it's outside the circle
lying piece is equal to the product -

124
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:18,926
- of the second secant and its
outside the circle lying piece, -

125
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:23,948
- and the tangent is mean proportional between
the secant and its outside circle intermediate piece.

126
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,198
It's pure logic, kid!

127
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,077
I don't understand, you can't learn it!

128
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,993
Jørgen!

129
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,196
Your lunch pack.

130
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,792
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

131
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,077
... then sparkle may
the dull look, -

132
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,034
- the paled cheeks glow.

133
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,315
So we travel
to our homeland,

134
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,593
where the the day don't lie dormant, -

135
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,155
there stands a castle
so proud and great ...

136
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,953
If you got earlier out the door, Ellerstrøm,
then you didn't get all the slaps.

137
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,153
Good morning! Let me remind the responsibility
that rests on everyone's shoulders.

138
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,115
You are the flower of Danish youth,
selected to suck nourishment -

139
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,800
- of this school's teachings.

140
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,309
Therefore, it's expected,
that you all do your best, -

141
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,799
- so we again can achieve the highest
grade point average in the country.

142
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,434
It's a long time
for the examination, -

143
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,758
- but it's now,
the work has to be done.

144
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,396
I can be reached in the parliament
the rest of the day.

145
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,591
Water is running out.

146
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,119
Get on!

147
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,915
Hurry, get on!

148
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,272
Hurry!

149
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,838
Well, Thygesen,
have you potential enough to -

150
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,999
- to tell us about
the Second Punic War?

151
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,836
Get up, Thygesen,
you obese youth.

152
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,317
Open your mighty jaws,
you whale-fish, -

153
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,399
- and spit your excellent
knowledges out.

154
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,752
Don't be stingy or
parsimonious with your wisdom, -

155
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,839
- but let also the rest of us
be allowed to sun ourselves -

156
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,555
- in the dazzling light
of your intellect.

157
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,751
Yes ...

158
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,236
The Second Pu ... Punic War -

159
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,436
- began in the year 218 BC.

160
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,757
A crucial role
in this war was ...

161
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,711
... Ha... Ha...

162
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,877
Ha.. Ha ...

163
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,551
What is it,
that is so fun, Fatsen?

164
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,993
- Ha ... Hannibal's war elephants.
- Well, that is, what is so funny.

165
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,149
Curiously enough, that just you think,
elephants are funny.

166
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,514
You, even personally
reminds a lot of this heavy animal.

167
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,669
Wrong fanfare.
Sit down, lazy fat lump and sleep again.

168
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,829
If you continue in the way,
you will end up as candy boiler.

169
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,873
Maybe we could get Edward to
right the elephant outpourings?

170
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,190
Go ahead, Edward, you my firmly
support in this motley bunch.

171
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,515
You always can your stuff.

172
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,997
The Second Punic war
began in the year 218 BC.

173
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,875
A crucial role was
Hannibal's war elephants.

174
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:29,599
Hannibal led the army, 60.000 men
and 37 elephants, across the Pyrenees.

175
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,315
Then he went through Gaul, -

176
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,070
- and when the Gauls were put to
route, he came to the Alps.

177
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,159
Undaunted, he began
the dangerous march, -

178
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,559
- and after 14 days of effort,
he reached the Cisalpine Gaul.

179
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:54,313
There he defeated the two
consuls, Scipio and Sempronius.

180
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,556
Wonderful.

181
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,831
Come here, my own little pet.

182
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,999
- Come on, you can always your stuff.
- Stop it now.

183
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,278
Shouldn't it have changed water?

184
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,879
I don't want water in my pants!
Let go!

185
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,514
My mom gets upset!
No, no!

186
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,831
Ouch, don't!

187
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,032
Oh, woe!

188
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,232
I say it to my mom!

189
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,475
Come on, Marshy.

190
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,039
Can't you change it?

191
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,478
What is turtle named in latin?

192
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,158
Paddus.

193
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,111
Oh, woe ...

194
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,839
- What are you doing?.
- It's not your business, Thyggesen.

195
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,633
Beware, it's carnivorous.

196
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,831
The monkey is evil!

197
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,757
The monkey is evil!

198
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,758
And that's one offered me!

199
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,119
Mogensen! Up to the blackboard.

200
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,431
Sit!

201
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,754
Your wretched rascal!

202
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,560
Who do you think, you are?

203
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,911
And this mess
dare you offer me!

204
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,591
Such a simple problem
solved completely wrong.

205
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,839
Do you know, what you are?
You're a saboteur!

206
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,829
You know very well,
how the problem must be solved.

207
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,713
It's so ridiculous logic!

208
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,593
You don't make a fool out of me.

209
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:25,559
Are we going to fetch your father again?

210
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,475
Then he might
beat some sense into you!

211
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,792
Look here!

212
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,515
P, Q, R, S. ...

213
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,997
And then we have given P Q -

214
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,791
- is 3 root 10 ...

215
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,356
Q R 6 ...

216
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,670
R S 2 ...

217
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,717
Rod 5 ...

218
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,838
P S 5 root 2 ...

219
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,871
Q S 4 ...

220
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,757
Root 5.

221
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,797
And then we prove,
that triangle P Q R ...

222
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,515
... is isosceles!

223
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,632
And what do we then do?

224
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,799
Well, you're stubborn.
You will not?

225
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,992
Scoundrel! Scoundrel! Scoundrel!

226
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,355
Down with you, Mogensen.
And Nielsen, up here!

227
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,514
Are we sitting and amuse us?

228
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,835
You may proceed.

229
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,113
Well!

230
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,319
3 root 10 multiply by 2 -

231
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,115
- root 5 equal to 4 -

232
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,356
- root 5 multiply by P R.

233
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,267
So the undefined terms in the equation!

234
00:26:19,268 --> 00:26:19,992
How long is the line?

235
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,472
P R 6 multiply by 5 equals to 30 -

236
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,798
- root 2 plus 30 ...
root 2 multiply by P R.

237
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,636
- Is it true?
- Yes.

238
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,719
60 root 2, 4 root 5
multiply by P R.

239
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,671
- Is it true?
- Yes.

240
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,759
P R multiply by 3 root 10.
Is it true?

241
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,313
Yes.

242
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,874
- Is it true?
- Yes.

243
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,229
I've never seen anything like this!

244
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,594
Are you kidding me!

245
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,473
Well, you're stubborn!

246
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,750
You know very well,
how the problem must be solved!

247
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,793
It's so ridiculous logic!

248
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,075
Miserable scoundrel!

249
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,070
Your dad might
beat some sense into you!

250
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,077
Stop it.

251
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,838
He pulled it out of the wall.

252
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,277
Like this.

253
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,635
Hurry, give Axel the cake,
before he tears down the entire hut.

254
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,354
Majbritt, wake up now.

255
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,160
Are they really beaten you?

256
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,639
It's just
such a kind of ... tradition.

257
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,353
- Does he say anything to your father?
- My God, he doesn't.

258
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:09,430
- What if he does?
- We'll probably get the teachers.

259
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,719
We'll begin with him.

260
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,752
"The Merman"?

261
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,350
- He's then very nice.
- You will not take part?

262
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,710
Yes, yes ... For what?

263
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,954
The Black Hand.

264
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,792
We revive The Black Hand.

265
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,630
- What are you talking about?
- Talking?

266
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,718
There is no one,
who's talking here.

267
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,031
- Have you heard anyone talking?
- No.

268
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,954
Why must you always
make your clothes so dirty ...

269
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,833
It was Aksel,
who did it.

270
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,875
When I was your age, I could
beat all the others in the school.

271
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,869
I don't care, that
you always blame others.

272
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,391
- The wasn't me.
- Listen to your mom. One must meet ones responsibility!

273
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,913
This is also relevant in business.
Otherwise the company run down.

274
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,833
Don't lie.
Dishonesty is the worst thing of all.

275
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,156
Thygesen & Son.

276
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,510
Just a moment.
I'll call the director.

277
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,007
Director Thygesen,
there's a phonecall for you!

278
00:29:33,008 --> 00:29:35,064
Yes, thank you.
Now I'll be there.

279
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:43,149
Director Thygesen here.
What can I do for you?

280
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,550
What?
We owe you money?

281
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,351
Just a moment, then I'll
contact the company's treasurer.

282
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,234
Then we'll get that little case
out of the world.

283
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,237
Miss Andersen, -

284
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,195
- will you write a check
to butcher Hermansen?

285
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,719
Yes ...

286
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,948
Yes, so it's executed.
Goodbye, goodbye.

287
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,953
I think, we should change butcher.

288
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,031
Herman's products are not,
what they have been.

289
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,072
Now make your homework.

290
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,390
Edward, I don't like, when you're playing.
Can't you let the clarinet be!

291
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,549
One can well be
musician without going under!

292
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,318
Thank you.

293
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,149
If you fail me,
I don't know, what to do.

294
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,831
I'm not so strong anymore,
as you might think.

295
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,478
So we're not talking more about that.

296
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,310
You would better
spend time doing homework, Edward.

297
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,829
I've done the most of it.

298
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,910
May I go over to Michael tonight?
We must read latin.

299
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,918
Yes, of course, my boy.

300
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,590
It's still here.

301
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,396
The Black Hand ...

302
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,233
The symbol of revenge and justice.

303
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,115
The struggle for the good against the evil.

304
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:45,118
It's time, that The Black Hand
waking from its hibernation.

305
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,754
The first victim is The Merman.

306
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,269
Agree?

307
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,919
We need two potatoes
and a carrot.

308
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,878
Come on!

309
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,073
I'll just blame.
I'll not be with you!

310
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,112
We dare not join in, Thygesen?

311
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,880
Into the closet with him.

312
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,757
He comes!

313
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,995
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

314
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,713
Yes ...

315
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,434
Where was it, we came to?

316
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,075
- Nielsen?
- The internal secretion.

317
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,475
Yes, that's right.

318
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,229
The ... internal secretion ...

319
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,309
- Are we already reached to that point?
- We had to read on it today.

320
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,998
Okay ...

321
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,875
The internal secretion ...

322
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,760
There comes a time in your life,
not now of course -

323
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,715
- but for a few years, when
you have got your degree, -

324
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,389
- and has been
lawfully married, -

325
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,080
- where you must help, -

326
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,796
- ensuring the human
race against extinction.

327
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,152
It's your duty.
This is about "the internal secretions".

328
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,589
An excellent image of the
human reproduction, we see, -

329
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,589
- when the busy bee
gather nectar from flowers.

330
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,074
Are you not ashamed?

331
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,591
To belittle something
of the most beautiful here in life!

332
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,516
Be quiet!

333
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,478
Quiet!

334
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,559
- Let me out ...
- There are some rats in the closet.

335
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,594
I can't breathe.
Let me out.

336
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,200
Your nasty boy!

337
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,075
You're of course
one of the ringleaders behind this.

338
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,552
Then we might proceed.

339
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,157
What's going on here?

340
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,309
It's beautiful!

341
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,439
Beautiful!

342
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,272
Do I get to know, who is
the perpetrator of these perversions?

343
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,028
Was it you?

344
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,751
- Was it you?!
- No.

345
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,917
Good.

346
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,998
Who is head of the class order?

347
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,555
It's me.

348
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,476
Sit.

349
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,194
So tell me,
you obese Crassus ...

350
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,996
If you can overcome
your innate indolence, -

351
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:18,116
- so open your jaws and tell,
who's behind this mess!

352
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,599
- We have all been involved.
- Who is the creator?

353
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,430
I don't know.
We have all been involved.

354
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,210
It's the pure and
simple communism!

355
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:38,819
This vulgar method, to cover up
each others!

356
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,592
This misguided cronyism,
which has become fashionable in our time!

357
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,669
These bandits, who made
this, are bad companions, -

358
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,634
- as it's not worth
to cover up!

359
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,636
So tell me,
Mr. Jørgen Thygesen, -

360
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,150
- who is the creator?

361
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,235
Edward?

362
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,757
All leave the classroom,
but you three will stay.

363
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,429
- Can I do something?
- No, thank you. I'll handle this.

364
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,471
Many thanks.

365
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,876
Out!

366
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,079
I prefer to believe, that there
must be a misunderstanding, Edward.

367
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,598
I can't imagine,
you've helped, to do this.

368
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,873
It's not true, right?

369
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:44,092
It goes så well, Edward, right!

370
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,719
If you want good advice,
so stay away from these two.

371
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:56,358
It's not company for you.
Do you understand?

372
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,830
Look at me.

373
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,716
Do you understand, what I'm saying?

374
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,429
In the future there will be
watch very closely on you two!

375
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,359
Forward!

376
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,511
Forward, come on!

377
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,119
Hurry!

378
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,750
Come on, come on!

379
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,156
Yes, forward!

380
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,034
What the hell, Ellerstrøm! Are you raping the animal?
It's damn a male horse!

381
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,595
He thinks, it's Blomme.

382
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,119
Forward!

383
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,200
What's this chick ...

384
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,072
Forward!

385
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,556
I can't take it anymore.
These kids drive me crazy.

386
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,639
Yes, one feel, one is
wasting the precious time.

387
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,929
It blocks any form
of research.

388
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,679
One must resign oneself to one's fate, -

389
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,117
to educate by the school's
tradition, is our duty.

390
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,993
We hold on a legacy.

391
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,228
There are also nice boys
between. Mikael Mogensen ...

392
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,158
I think, his father is engineer.

393
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,989
- And Ellerstrøm.
- Oh yes, Edward ...

394
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,989
There's something different with him,
orderly and well behaved.

395
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,398
- One must be over them.
- I just think ...

396
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,548
Just it don't ends up,
that the children are going to hate us.

397
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,515
As Caesar always said:
"Oderint, dum metuant."

398
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:42,196
"Let them just hate,
as long as they fear".

399
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,635
If there's anything, I can be met
in the parliament the rest of the day.

400
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,549
One doesn't leave, Edward.
Eat up now.

401
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,432
Well!

402
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:25,189
Shouldn't you have been to international
match with Michael and the others?

403
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,076
No, it didn't happen.

404
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,199
Uncle Børge would
also have liked to have you with.

405
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:43,713
He must stand and scream alone. It's
just before, one can hear him, right?

406
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,556
- Is it going well at school?
- Yes, we're so happy for it.

407
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,709
Let aunt hear a little of the
beautiful poems about Pyramus and Thisbe.

408
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,436
- Now let the boy be free.
- No, come on, Edward.

409
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,348
Is it not something as
Fistula Columbo ...?

410
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,516
(Latin) Fistula plumbo...

411
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,270
Scinditur et tenui stridente
foramine longas eiaculatur -

412
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,312
- aquas atque ictibus aera rumpit.

413
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,070
Isn't it beautiful?
He is no. 2 in his class.

414
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,555
That's fine.

415
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,754
And we agree, that the next time
you are no. 1. Right, Edward?

416
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,552
Yes.

417
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,118
What will you be?

418
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:42,872
It's really intended.
Edward must be a lawyer. Right, Edward?

419
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,476
Yes.

420
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,959
So it's "The Monkey's" turn.

421
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,549
And then Ejby ...

422
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,509
And Blomme ...

423
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,550
And then we'll have
Blomme's little darling.

424
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,878
I'm sorry for him.

425
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,868
- They're dead.
- I mean Edward ...

426
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,279
- I'm sorry for him.
- We don't need renegades.

427
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,997
Oops ...

428
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,591
Why the hellshould you always make scandal.
The order is lost!

429
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,633
You should at least have
given him an apology!

430
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,754
You're sitting here yet?

431
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,598
Good evening.

432
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,598
Oops ...

433
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,597
A poem.

434
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,392
So you write poems, Aksel ...

435
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,799
To Majbritt. I will lend you
a tiny bit. A day, an hour. -

436
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,674
I will be a whooshing
in your heart's conch, -

437
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,554
a breathe of air that brushes
your hair and mouth.

438
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,753
How beautiful, Aksel. Have you written 
it yourself? Keep it up.

439
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,031
It doesn't hurt
with a little poetry.

440
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,755
It's damn
always better than him!

441
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,829
That kid can take over
a reputable construction company, -

442
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,919
- and then he sits
and fiddling with insects.

443
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,350
Do you know, what you shoud do?
You should read maths!

444
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,072
Shouldn't you
also go to bed?

445
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,799
What about that over there?

446
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,356
- What do you think, it is here?
- 1000.

447
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,518
It is 8. Isn't it funny?

448
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,635
Had it been the decimal system,
then would the digits have been -

449
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,595
- Ones, tens, hundreds and
thousands, and there would be 1011.

450
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,555
But now I've written it
in a binary system, so it is ...

451
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,237
And fours ...

452
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,231
... twos and ones!

453
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,036
Funny, right?
Let's look at the addition problem.

454
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,720
1 and 1 you would think was 2, -

455
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,436
- but it becomes 0 plus number carried.
It is funny ...

456
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:20,111
... a number carried, that falls
down here in the box, right?

457
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,199
Now we'll have
a truly masculine play.

458
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,920
Whoever stays inside the circle
the longest time, is the winner!

459
00:49:27,922 --> 00:49:29,387
It's like in real life.

460
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:39,276
Can't you take part
in such a small Christmas-play?

461
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,595
Back with you!

462
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,957
That's good!

463
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,395
Yes, the devil ...

464
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,311
Just turn on!

465
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,395
Well done, boys.

466
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,753
Now it's dammit Christmas!

467
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,954
Come on, Ellerstrøm,
Give him back!

468
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,070
- Do you think, something has happened?
- Of course not ...

469
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,876
Mogensen, damn,
now see, what you've done!

470
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,351
Merry Christmas!

471
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,552
That garden,
Angels of God are flying in, -

472
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:57,435
Jesus will open for us; -

473
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,358
Heaven's King lives among us, -

474
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,508
Christmas joy he brings us, -

475
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:16,550
he embraces each child's soul on earth, -

476
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:23,070
and promise us angel wings!

477
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,676
The Christmas is the home's celebration.
Anyone, who has been hard-working, -

478
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,237
- can now rest a few days
with clear conscience.

479
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,238
Others can make up for lost time.

480
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:45,229
After the new year, I expect
extra diligence and punctuality.

481
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,157
Merry Christmas.

482
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,637
Peace on earth
and in the human's well-being.

483
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,912
I'll not know
of any kind of riots.

484
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,068
There will be crackdown
on troublemakers. Merry Christmas!

485
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,074
Merry Christmas, Mogensen
... and Nielsen.

486
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,077
Happy New Year!

487
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:19,871
You can retrieve your grade book
at the rector's office.

488
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,949
I think, one stand for something
uncomfortable. Merry Christmas.

489
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,157
Christmas Peace has descended, right?

490
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,274
- Blomme has been killing us.
- I can sign them.

491
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,512
It will not work,
otherwise thank you very much.

492
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,995
- What would it be?.
- A few crullers ...

493
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,588
Do you the get beatings at home?

494
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,509
My father beats me simply to death.

495
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,240
We should then just ...

496
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,399
We just need to avenge it.

497
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,116
- We'll find on something.
- Come on, Aksel!

498
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,512
What ...

499
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,391
Are you never going in the cinema?

500
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,834
- At the cinema?
- Yes.

501
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,152
What do you say to
Roxy second Christmas Day?

502
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,551
- Are you going with?
- Yes ...

503
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,680
I'm afraid, I can't.

504
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,078
I've too much,
I must have been obtained.

505
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,636
Goodbye.

506
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,114
You're a glutton, -

507
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,038
- a real little glutton ...

508
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,716
I'll light.

509
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,669
The Black Hand ...

510
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,312
Is it one,
you got for Christmas?

511
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,355
Relax. He can't know, who it is,
if only you keep your mouth shut.

512
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,359
Have you heard, Kurt Hansen
has been thrown out?

513
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,677
By the way, before we split today, -

514
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,954
- I should just hear, if these gentlemen
have had a good Christmas?

515
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,071
Well thanks.

516
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,159
Has one got
some nice Christmas gifts?

517
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,679
Yes, thank you.

518
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,475
I got this, among other things ...

519
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,271
... black hand.

520
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,869
"Manus nigra".

521
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,719
There was no card -

522
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:28,072
- so I can't thank
the noble giver.

523
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:40,955
It's probably not escaped
the gentleman's attention, -

524
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,949
- that Kurt Hansen is no longer
frequents this school.

525
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,959
On this occasion
I have a little story.

526
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:54,198
In the period around the birth of Christ,
there was a brave, -

527
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,279
- but foolhardy slave
named Spartacus.

528
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,428
He started a slave revolt against
the Romans, but he made that mistake, -

529
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:08,236
- completely underestimating
his enemy's strength.

530
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:13,753
The slaves had to surrender.
All the insurgents were crucified and planted -

531
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:19,273
- along the Via Appia,
with Spartacus as the first.

532
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:24,076
A large flock of black birds
discovered the crucified, -

533
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:29,558
- and after a few hours was
all the slaves eyes chopped out.

534
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,552
Yes ... such is the way,
Gentlemen, -

535
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:41,037
- when ignorant slaves make a rebellion.

536
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,320
Have a continued good day!

537
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,591
Edward, wait a minute.

538
00:58:02,176 --> 00:58:03,176
Sit down!

539
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,476
I want to talk with you.

540
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,309
Would you like a piece of candy?

541
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,875
Go ahead.

542
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:27,394
I'm extremely pleased
with your efforts, Edward.

543
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,878
It's guys like you, the community
must build its future on.

544
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,391
You'll know, that I
considering to set you up -

545
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:40,991
- to the school's special
prize for diligence.

546
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,317
What do you say to that?

547
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,956
Thanks ... many thanks.

548
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,311
That was, what I had to say.

549
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,071
One moment.

550
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:59,311
Is there something,
you would like to say?

551
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,469
About what?

552
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,957
You know it, if
there's something.

553
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,913
I can see it at you.

554
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,749
We two know each other
very well, right?

555
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,555
Tell me so.

556
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,478
Who owns this Manus Nigra?

557
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:28,230
I don't know anything about it ...
I don't know.

558
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,119
Well.

559
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,516
Then you can think about it.

560
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:42,515
If we two must preserve
our good relationship with each other, -

561
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:47,714
- then you're telling me,
who owns that hand ...

562
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,878
... tomorrow.

563
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,558
Is he too late?.
So he needs a slap!

564
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:32,875
I will not tolerate
any kind of noise and riots!

565
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,074
Why isn't you,
who is no. 1?

566
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:16,239
I still can't see,
that there's something wrong with you.

567
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:20,831
You don't have fever ...
How long have you been sick?

568
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:25,431
Ten days, but he
read extensively at home.

569
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,558
Surely it isn't girlfriend troubles?

570
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,638
He's only a child ...

571
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,951
Yes yes ...

572
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:39,471
- How are you in school?
- It goes very well.

573
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,434
Edward is almost
no. 1 in his class.

574
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:48,714
He is so glad of his school.
Isn't it right, Edward?

575
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:54,313
That's good. So we agree,
that you go to school tomorrow.

576
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:59,116
I think, you also need to
to get some fresh air.

577
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,039
Rector's coming!

578
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,113
Associate Professor Blomme is sick.

579
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,870
He suffered minor injuries
in a bus.

580
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,959
As a substitute, you'll get
Mr. lecturer ... Langhave.

581
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,994
I will not tolerate
noise and riots!

582
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:44,557
There will be cracked down
on troublemakers. Goodbye!

583
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,510
Goodbye.

584
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,714
Please sit down.

585
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:05,035
My name is Gunnar Langhave.
We should now talk about -

586
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:10,075
- the exception to the rule that words
ending with "is" is feminine.

587
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,873
- Is it true?
- Yes.

588
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,999
Good.

589
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,680
Has anyone a bid?

590
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,713
Yes ... and you're called?

591
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:27,311
- Thy ... Thygesen.
- Sorry?

592
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,080
His name is Thygesen!

593
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:34,159
- You must also have a first name.
- The Elephant.

594
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,840
The elephant? Well ...

595
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,757
So we're obviously related.

596
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,559
I welcome that. Gunnar ...

597
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,150
- Jørgen ...
- What is your bid?

598
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,033
- Amnis.
- Right.

599
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,549
Are there any other bids?

600
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,392
Callis.

601
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,637
- Aksel ...
- Right. More?

602
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:11,589
Edward. Sorry ...
Canalis.

603
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,119
Yes.

604
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:18,268
A word as "disciplina" ... how
do you inflect it in accusative?

605
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,752
Disciplinam.

606
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:24,838
- And in genitive?
- Disciplinae.

607
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,838
- Dative?
- Also disciplinae.

608
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,474
- Ablative?
- Disciplina.

609
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,556
Preservative?

610
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:54,350
- Torquis, torris...
- Ungvis, vectis, vermis.

611
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,675
And nougat-ice ...

612
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:01,555
Mrs. Svendsen, spit your
excellent knowledge out.

613
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,834
Let us be allowed to bask a little
by the light of your intellect.

614
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,998
Three cornets with it all!

615
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,198
Goodbye.

616
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,750
It's for you.

617
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,678
Thank you.

618
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,635
So, gentlemen ...

619
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,198
- So is served.
- Thanks.

620
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:19,393
- And it's my turn.
- Thank you.

621
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,031
Yes, excellent!

622
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:26,277
What is key in nominative?

623
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,755
- Mikael?
- Clavis.

624
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:32,270
- Let go.
- Clavem.

625
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,918
Clavis.

626
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:39,079
It's then not
in our curriculum.

627
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,158
- Come on, man!
- Clavi.

628
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,238
- Clave.
- Good, Jørgen.

629
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,309
What the hell!

630
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:55,190
Who has thrown the keys down here?

631
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:59,791
Sorry. I could hardly
make you throw them up here again?

632
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,754
-- If it's not too high ...
- Too high?!

633
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:22,115
Errare humanum est.
Translate.

634
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:26,709
- It's human to make mistakes.
- Fine.

635
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:44,229
One has learned
to be on time, right?

636
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,031
He comes now.

637
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,795
Today it's Langhave's birthday
hurray, hurray, hurray ...

638
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,516
he certainly become a gift,
as he has wished for this year ...

639
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,551
with lovely cho ...

640
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:26,271
What on earth
should this be?

641
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,231
Sit.

642
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,958
What's that?

643
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,515
A cake.

644
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:45,759
That has brushed my attention. 
Is it you, having placed it there?

645
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:49,350
It's just a gift ...

646
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,551
It's nice, Thygesen.

647
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:56,117
It's bribery
of an official in function.

648
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,151
Take it away!

649
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:06,710
One observe, that Ellerstrøm
has risen himself from his sickbed.

650
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:11,118
It seems to me,
that his Apollo-face -

651
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,238
- has undergone a transformation ...

652
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:17,432
Now he's suddenly well enough -

653
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:24,079
- playing negro music in the latin-hour!
Are you become crazy?

654
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:29,115
Lay however that blowing horn,
your heinous pimple-infested kid!

655
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,836
Up to the blackboard.

656
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:38,829
Let's take his favorite poem
Pyramus and Thisbe.

657
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,999
Wake up and tell
your humble listening teacher, -

658
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:47,910
- how it relates
with the small mysterious word "an" -

659
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,156
- in the seventh line from above?

660
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:54,671
Did't you expected,
that Ovid would have used -

661
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,749
- "Utrum" or "ne" in the first part
of the disjunctive asking sentence?

662
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,757
Hadn't you?

663
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:06,510
Come on, Ellerstrøm! You maybe have
got pimples on your tongue?

664
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:11,668
Is your brain become one large
festering pimple? I wish you'd bother!

665
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:16,476
"An" is used in a dependent sentence,
whose first term is omitted.

666
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:21,470
Again! I didn't hear, what your
pimple-infested mouth said.

667
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:26,310
"An" is used in a dependent sentence,
whose first term is omitted.

668
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:30,558
- I can't hear.
- "An" is used in ...

669
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,513
Higher, Pimplepig!
Speak loudly and clearly.

670
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,393
- "An" is the first part ...
- Aha!

671
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,799
- "An" is the first part?
- No. I mean ...

672
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:44,799
"An" is used in a sentence,
whose first part ...

673
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:48,799
Nonsense, Ellerstrøm! You got
an incorrect clause, -

674
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,835
- when you feel up in the bag.
You guessed wrong!

675
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,878
Again!

676
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,875
I meant of course also ...

677
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:06,436
You must know!

678
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,997
I know you ... "Give him
just something, that idiot".

679
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:15,432
It's your method. Again!

680
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,915
Further, your wart hog!

681
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:26,992
What the devil! Are you standing and 
throwing up and down at me?

682
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,758
Out!
Your pig, out!

683
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:33,556
Just wait for the exam! Wait for the spring!
I can't wait!

684
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:38,234
Thygesen,
remove that vomitus.

685
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:07,239
You can do it very good.
Again ...

686
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:23,591
... second part of the disjunctive
question, but also ...

687
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,430
- Hello!
- It's fucking Kurt Hansen.

688
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,754
Well ... come on.

689
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:07,951
When you're so industrious,
it will be good.

690
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,629
Beware, you don't get cold.

691
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,398
So ...

692
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,552
Mom ...

693
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:26,319
What is it, my boy?

694
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,239
Nothing.

695
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,470
Good night.

696
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,880
Here one have to teach -

697
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,551
- between the stinky gas taps
and chemical fumes!

698
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:55,038
ne have to be detectives to find
a place, where you can teach.

699
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:59,756
Open the window, so the smell
of gas can leak out. Sit down.

700
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:06,556
Let's now return
to the small word "an".

701
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:10,117
When do we use it?

702
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,120
Pimplepig! Speak -

703
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:18,394
- if you can open your mouth
without having to swim over by vomitus.

704
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,355
I'm waiting!

705
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:28,834
In the hottest hell ...

706
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:34,080
However, it's dammit, that you must
be disturbed by these sports freaks ...

707
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,430
Close that window!

708
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:43,275
A sad case, gentlemen.

709
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,631
Once an industrious
and nice student.

710
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:50,639
Now he even don't want
to open his mouth.

711
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:54,639
It shouldn't go up
like Hansen.

712
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,149
We're still waiting.

713
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,235
I've forgotten it.

714
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:04,319
There's nothing
to do with that.

715
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,238
- Nielsen?
- I think ...

716
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:11,194
Thanks, you just sit down
and relax.

717
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:13,675
Further, Nielsen!

718
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,952
Go ahead, Mr. Nielsen!

719
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:24,636
"An" isn't only used in the second part
of disjunctive questions -

720
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:29,515
- but also when one ask about
objections to the foregoing, -

721
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:33,599
- or when one oneself
to a question is adding the answer -

722
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,915
- in the form of a new question.

723
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:40,431
Excellent, Nielsen.
Absolutely brilliant.

724
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:12,636
Are you aware of, how
gravity the situation is for you?

725
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:17,709
I can't vote for
your promotion to the next class.

726
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,878
I don't dare to take the responsibility.

727
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:25,153
It's for your own best ...

728
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,796
I'm forced to
to sacrifice you, Edward, -

729
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:32,276
- although it makes me heartily sorry.

730
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,391
Yes ...

731
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,829
Well! I must get on.

732
01:17:52,673 --> 01:17:54,840
STRYICHNINE

733
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:43,268
This knock-about life ... one
don't know, where one has ones issues.

734
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,517
Damn!

735
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:55,279
You thought,
I had forgotten them ...

736
01:18:55,400 --> 01:19:00,394
You would almost have one, because
you haven't eaten them all.

737
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,078
Go ahead.

738
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:10,956
Just take. You can probably
need a refreshment.

739
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,076
We must continue!

740
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,273
It's so unbelievable, -

741
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,791
- that Associate Professor Blomme
is no longer among us.

742
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,556
So strangely, helpless
and poor, we're standing here -

743
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:05,798
- in this beautiful
Danish summerday.

744
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,832
Our thought can't hold it -

745
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,872
- our intellect
can't understand it.

746
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,551
We are faced to
the incomprehensible.

747
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:21,197
I will not know of the noise
in this serious moment!

748
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:25,154
There will be cracked down
on troublemakers.

749
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:28,352
All honour to his memory!

750
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:37,239
The students of this year
have now passed their exam -

751
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,671
- and is ready to
to go out in the life -

752
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,839
- to find their
place in the society.

753
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,476
We know, that we have
given them a ballast, -

754
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,990
- that always will be a part of them.

755
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:57,275
Before I go any further
with speech to this year's students, -

756
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:02,110
- it's my great pleasure
to be able to present -

757
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:05,789
- the school's annual prize
for diligence to ...

758
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,478
... Aksel Nielsen from 1. G.

759
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:17,549
He is No. 1 in his class
with an average of ug minus.

760
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:31,359
Let this be
a welcome proof of this, -

761
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:35,917
- that even son of a
carpenter will emerge -

762
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:41,478
- if he has the requisite abilities
and the requisite diligence.

763
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:57,908
Life is seriosness,
and the school must teach -

764
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:02,830
the child, that
each step isn't soft, -

765
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:07,875
the shoulder of the young
get burdens to bear, -

766
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,755
but when the faithful
have borned them steadily, -

767
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,314
trala lala lala

768
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:22,158
eja which tastes
then the rest sweet, -

769
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:25,320
trala lala lala

770
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:32,353
eja which tastes
then the rest sweet.

771
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:02,719
"Then we have
a truly masculine-play!"

772
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:06,155
"Those, who stay inside the circle
the longest time, is the winner!"

773
01:23:06,156 --> 01:23:08,608
"Like in the real life!"

774
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,632
Camilla...

775
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:44,991
I've written a poem for you.

776
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,430
Will you hear it?

777
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:54,033
I will lend you
a tiny bit,

778
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,754
one day, one hour,

779
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,839
just one second,

780
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:06,478
I will be a whooshing
in your hearts' conch,

781
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:12,232
a breath of air to roam
your hair and your mouth.

782
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,960
It's for you.

783
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:26,595
My wife has been disgusting
for the male sperm.

784
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:31,350
So now she lies
in a double bed and drink liqueurs -

785
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,914
- and getting fatter and fatter.

786
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:39,478
- Why don't you substitute her with another?
- I can't so it in my position.

787
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,158
Cheers.

788
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:46,035
Well, Thygesen ... you probably sort
out the coolies out in Bangkok?

789
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,435
You can damned believe that.

790
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,519
It's damn gonna
be fashioned again!

791
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:57,592
Do you remember, when we
joked with the Merman?

792
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:02,669
- It was me, who planted the blackboard.
- I made the cord drive!

793
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,839
It was me, who killed Blomme.

794
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:13,355
Can you remember, when we came
a salted herring into the aquarium?

795
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:18,429
One would certainly wish,
that one had done it one self.

796
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:05,029
The world is young
and green and juicy.
