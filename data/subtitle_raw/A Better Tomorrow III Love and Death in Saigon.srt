1
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:48,316
How's the situation over in
Phnom Penh?

2
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,021
A lot of personnel changes.

3
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:53,031
The situation can still be
considered stable.

4
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:12,949
Sir, you can't take my money

5
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:15,044
I know that is my fault

6
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:18,215
The money is very important
to me for saving a life.

7
00:05:18,257 --> 00:05:20,748
Can you give it back to me?
Thank you.

8
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:32,228
What's up?

9
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:50,072
Cheung Chi-Mun
You're free to leave prison.

10
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:15,039
Mark

11
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,178
I was supposed to pick you
up at the airport...

12
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:27,013
Instead you picked me up at
prison

13
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:37,321
Where's Dad?

14
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:39,555
Uncle's waiting for you at
the drug store.

15
00:07:39,698 --> 00:07:42,258
Yesterday I almost lost my
life at the airport.

16
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:44,096
If I hadn't paid them off,

17
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:46,261
we'd be meeting inside the
prison.

18
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:48,430
When those customs officers
see money,

19
00:07:48,574 --> 00:07:50,166
their eyes light up like car
headlights.

20
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:53,278
Mark, you went through a lot
of trouble for me.

21
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,074
Pedicab

22
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:57,181
It's a good thing they like
money.

23
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:59,079
Otherwise you'd still be
rotting in jail.

24
00:07:59,118 --> 00:08:01,143
Bye-bye

25
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,720
"Bye-bye"

26
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:12,126
Is that "goodbye" in
Vietnamese?

27
00:08:12,164 --> 00:08:14,724
They don't know what you're
saying

28
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,432
In Hong Kong, what do you
hear about the war?

29
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:23,006
We've got a piece of news
black-out, don't know a thing

30
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,632
The radio and newspapers
all report...

31
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:26,372
...the Viet Cong are very
close to the city.

32
00:08:26,412 --> 00:08:28,073
The situation is terrible.

33
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:34,485
It's good you've come back.
Help me persuade Dad.

34
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,920
He's not convinced that the
situation is bad.

35
00:08:36,955 --> 00:08:39,014
You said there's a news
black-out here.

36
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:41,151
How can anybody know what's
going on?

37
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:43,593
The city looks peaceful
enough.

38
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:45,654
Mun, didn't you apply for
Uncle's visa?

39
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:48,923
The line outside immigration
goes on forever.

40
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:50,958
You get nowhere without
bribes.

41
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:53,028
The Chinese have been here
for decades.

42
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:54,369
Asking them to shut down
their businesses...

43
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:56,465
...is worse than killing
them.

44
00:08:56,508 --> 00:08:58,442
Why do you think I worked
in the black market?

45
00:08:58,477 --> 00:08:59,774
Only to get him a passport.

46
00:08:59,812 --> 00:09:01,780
And it all came to nothing.

47
00:09:02,915 --> 00:09:05,110
Which one of us gets them?

48
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:09,620
They're yours

49
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:11,955
Hello

50
00:09:12,124 --> 00:09:13,614
How are you?

51
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:41,977
War mongers, go home

52
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:52,760
Let's make a fast turn

53
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:36,099
The pedicab's broken down.
- Get off and push

54
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:38,326
Great

55
00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:44,201
Chicken buttocks

56
00:11:44,443 --> 00:11:47,412
Pat, get the soy sauce.

57
00:12:03,228 --> 00:12:07,358
Uncle, here's some wine.

58
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:09,559
I put Chinese wine in a
foreign brandy bottle.

59
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:11,259
Almost got confiscated in
customs.

60
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:13,669
Drink up so it won't go to
waste. - Yeah

61
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:16,639
You're clever to put the
wine in a brandy bottle.

62
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,105
Mainland Chinese products
aren't allowed in.

63
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:23,045
You've to remove the label
or change the bottle.

64
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:25,581
Did you go to Mainland China
to see your Dad?

65
00:12:26,018 --> 00:12:28,111
How can I go there now?

66
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:30,587
It's chaos there with the
Cultural Revolution.

67
00:12:30,622 --> 00:12:33,318
Even if I went, I wouldn't
know how to find him.

68
00:12:33,358 --> 00:12:34,791
We've been separated for
over ten years.

69
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:38,489
Uncle, I bought this at the
China Products Store.

70
00:12:38,797 --> 00:12:40,264
This is good wine

71
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,664
Delicious

72
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:44,265
Pat

73
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:48,302
Not fish sauce. I hate fish
sauce.

74
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,332
I want soy sauce

75
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:53,708
The black stuff

76
00:12:53,745 --> 00:12:56,009
Get going

77
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:57,379
Soy sauce.

78
00:12:57,783 --> 00:12:59,580
Who's that kid?

79
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:03,213
At New Years when the Viet
Cong entered Hue,

80
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:04,950
he was separated from his
parents.

81
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,357
I took pity on him and took
him in.

82
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:10,418
When I asked him his name,

83
00:13:10,462 --> 00:13:11,952
he just stammered.

84
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:13,988
I didn't understand what
he said.

85
00:13:14,032 --> 00:13:16,364
So I call him Pat.

86
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:19,270
Dad

87
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:23,165
What was Dad gabbing about?

88
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:11,051
We need money to get Dad
out of here.

89
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:13,023
I was already arrested by
them once.

90
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:15,049
A second time would be very
dangerous.

91
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:17,755
But there's a war going on.

92
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:19,787
It's dangerous no matter
what you do.

93
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:22,129
Anyway, nothing ventured
nothing gained.

94
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:33,038
Who are you looking for?

95
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:35,171
My ex-boss went to Thailand.

96
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:37,807
When I was in prison, Chung
told me of new buyer.

97
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:40,181
Miss Chow Ying-Kit.

98
00:14:45,657 --> 00:14:47,181
I'm familiar with Saigon.

99
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:49,216
May be I'll recognise this
Chow.

100
00:14:53,732 --> 00:14:56,826
Which one of us gets her?

101
00:15:03,008 --> 00:15:04,600
She's mine

102
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,980
She's responding

103
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,619
Not the reaction we hoped
for

104
00:15:27,432 --> 00:15:29,900
Are you Cheung Chi-Mun?

105
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:31,334
Hello, Mr. Chow

106
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:32,336
Hello.

107
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,567
This is my cousin Mark.

108
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:38,041
Let's go over there.

109
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:57,053
Mr. Cheung, you've just
gotten out of prison.

110
00:15:57,095 --> 00:15:58,824
You're fast at making
connections.

111
00:15:58,864 --> 00:16:01,799
What's your connection with
Bong?

112
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,164
Chung introduced me.

113
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:04,930
Chung?
- Yes.

114
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,336
I can tell the soldiers
outside...

115
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:08,896
...to use you for target
practice

116
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,135
What's the matter?

117
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:13,138
They're looking for Chow
Ying-Kit.

118
00:16:13,178 --> 00:16:15,908
These two guys are friends
of mine.

119
00:16:15,947 --> 00:16:17,881
Let me talk to them.

120
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,850
It's Ok.

121
00:16:21,153 --> 00:16:22,780
Leave

122
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:30,285
Does she know us?

123
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:32,262
This is your territory. Why
ask me?

124
00:16:32,297 --> 00:16:34,788
You're looking for Chow Ying
Kit?

125
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,666
He's "10th Uncle", the boss
here.

126
00:16:37,702 --> 00:16:39,897
I'm Chow Ying-Kit.

127
00:16:46,845 --> 00:16:49,006
Bong is a complicated
fellow.

128
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,981
He doesn't need you for
the black market.

129
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,711
There's lots of other ways
to make money.

130
00:16:53,752 --> 00:16:55,447
Why choose this path?

131
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:57,011
You've been in prison.

132
00:16:57,055 --> 00:17:00,513
If Bong cheats you...
...and you're arrested again

133
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,720
You'll never see HK again.

134
00:17:02,827 --> 00:17:04,818
I've done business with
Bong twice.

135
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:07,161
He could have betrayed me
long ago.

136
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,632
You say that Bong's
complicated.

137
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,794
In this business, aren't
we all?

138
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:12,930
Mr. Cheung.

139
00:17:12,971 --> 00:17:14,598
You're an outsider.

140
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:15,765
We're all Chinese.

141
00:17:15,807 --> 00:17:17,365
A piece of advice for you.

142
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:21,436
Don't get involved in things
you can't control.

143
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:22,537
Good-bye.

144
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:23,809
Miss Chow.

145
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:26,616
Miss Chow.

146
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:30,747
Please don't blame us for
our ignorance.

147
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:32,518
He's an overseas Chinese.

148
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:34,991
We're doing this for my
uncle.

149
00:17:35,026 --> 00:17:36,857
You know now these old
Chinese are.

150
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:39,090
They struggle all their
lives to get ahead

151
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,791
If I can't get them out of
here,

152
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:42,629
and they stay, what is it
all for?

153
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:45,932
So I've come back to take
them to Hong Kong.

154
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:48,303
I don't want to gamble like
this.

155
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,934
You've seen this country.
Everyone gambles.

156
00:17:50,976 --> 00:17:53,035
Including this war.

157
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:56,104
Nobody knows what tomorrow
will bring

158
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:58,811
Our gambling chips...

159
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,978
...are being played by
others.

160
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,955
We have no control over who
wins or loses.

161
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,484
Not even a choice over
whether to play or not.

162
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:13,987
If this were our own place,
we wouldn't need to leave.

163
00:18:14,032 --> 00:18:16,000
Everyone here tonight is
escaping.

164
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:18,468
To leave or to stay,

165
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:20,801
it's all a gamble.

166
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:23,239
You're very capable.

167
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:25,971
If you don't serve as the
casino's banker,

168
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:29,447
we won't even have a chance
to gamble.

169
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:32,109
You said that all of us are
Chinese.

170
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,811
Try to see it from our
perspective.

171
00:18:33,852 --> 00:18:37,151
Tell us what to do.

172
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:45,320
According to my usual
practice,

173
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:52,493
I never conduct business
here.

174
00:18:52,537 --> 00:18:54,437
As to the time and place,

175
00:18:54,472 --> 00:18:57,032
I'll have someone contact
you.

176
00:19:03,615 --> 00:19:04,912
What are you doing?

177
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:06,439
I'll have someone contact
you.

178
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:08,042
Don't bother. I'll answer it

179
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,487
It's just the phone Why so
anxious?

180
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,490
It's Mun's girlfriend.

181
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:18,087
Asking him to have a last
fling.

182
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:21,189
Then what are you so nervous
about?

183
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,596
Me?

184
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:25,736
Waiting for your girlfriend,
too?

185
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,635
Mun and I met that girl at
the same time.

186
00:19:27,672 --> 00:19:29,162
So part of the fling should
be mine.

187
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:31,971
I'm going over now for my
phone fling.

188
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:37,240
His Dad and I used to be
just like that, too.

189
00:19:37,282 --> 00:19:41,548
It's hard to escape the
tender trap

190
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:44,816
What are you laughing at?

191
00:19:44,856 --> 00:19:47,017
You don't even know what
I'm talking about

192
00:19:47,058 --> 00:19:49,185
Take your dinner

193
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:54,054
Let me have the phone
- Come on

194
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:55,699
Hello, Miss Chow.

195
00:19:55,734 --> 00:19:57,258
Hello?

196
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:00,201
Hello? Hello?

197
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:01,205
Why isn't she saying
anything?

198
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:04,675
She already hung up.
- Playing tricks on me

199
00:20:05,643 --> 00:20:07,110
What's up?

200
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:10,444
Tonight at 8:30 at the
Alhambra Theatre.

201
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:35,802
Miss Chow, it's getting late
still want to wait?

202
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:57,224
This car's from the Foreign
Ministry.

203
00:20:57,262 --> 00:20:59,492
They wouldn't dare to do
anything rash.

204
00:21:06,037 --> 00:21:07,095
Don't try anything

205
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:09,766
We have a permit from the
Foreign Ministry.

206
00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:24,714
Bong, Bong. - You haven't
stopped the car yet

207
00:21:24,756 --> 00:21:26,690
Mum Mum

208
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,622
Hello

209
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,921
We've been waiting for you
a long time.

210
00:21:33,198 --> 00:21:35,894
This is Hung.

211
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,672
Please excuse us for being
late, Miss Chow.

212
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:02,150
Miss Chow Ying-kit is the
buyer I told you about

213
00:22:02,193 --> 00:22:04,991
This is my cousin, Mark.

214
00:22:05,163 --> 00:22:06,858
Miss Chow, this is Bong.

215
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:09,389
Pleased to meet you.

216
00:22:16,774 --> 00:22:19,072
Let me help you with this.

217
00:22:24,949 --> 00:22:26,644
Move out of the way Over
there

218
00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:29,551
You, too. Hurry up

219
00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:39,625
Have a smoke.

220
00:22:39,664 --> 00:22:41,632
Let them conduct a thorough
search.

221
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,597
Have some gum and then
search him.

222
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:12,243
Come on

223
00:25:12,283 --> 00:25:14,148
Hurry up

224
00:25:16,988 --> 00:25:19,582
Go where?

225
00:25:19,624 --> 00:25:21,785
Upstairs.

226
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,341
Make a thorough search.

227
00:25:44,382 --> 00:25:45,713
Search upstairs.

228
00:26:10,374 --> 00:26:13,639
Mark, stay here. II'll stop
Bong from getting away.

229
00:26:24,522 --> 00:26:26,615
Don't go there. It's too
dangerous.

230
00:26:26,657 --> 00:26:28,181
The army is on its way up.

231
00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:30,217
Sooner or later we'll have
to make our escape.

232
00:26:40,972 --> 00:26:44,772
Cover me. I'll get the gold
back.

233
00:26:50,448 --> 00:26:52,643
No bullets left

234
00:28:02,553 --> 00:28:04,282
Take a jump, Mun

235
00:28:05,156 --> 00:28:07,716
Forget about the money.
Let's get out of here.

236
00:28:07,758 --> 00:28:09,988
What about Miss Chow?
How's Miss Chow?

237
00:28:21,305 --> 00:28:22,795
Over there

238
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,149
Mark

239
00:29:48,392 --> 00:29:50,553
Mark Mark

240
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:58,560
Mark, are you Ok?

241
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:14,139
Very proud of yourself,
aren't you?

242
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:33,519
Did you see Bong's
expression?

243
00:31:56,287 --> 00:31:58,346
You certainly earned your
commission.

244
00:31:58,389 --> 00:32:00,755
Otherwise, why go to so much
trouble?

245
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:04,784
I worship you more than any
other woman on earth

246
00:34:55,299 --> 00:34:57,767
Miss Chow,

247
00:34:57,801 --> 00:35:01,464
Let me return this to you.

248
00:35:03,574 --> 00:35:07,066
I hope I didn't get your
lipstick dirty.

249
00:35:07,344 --> 00:35:09,312
I forgot all about it

250
00:35:09,413 --> 00:35:12,405
I'd never thought you'd take
such good care of it

251
00:35:12,883 --> 00:35:17,377
Old songs always make for
great listening.

252
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:20,390
Proof that old things are
better than new ones.

253
00:35:20,424 --> 00:35:24,622
Do you agree with me?

254
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:27,063
"10th Uncle"

255
00:35:27,097 --> 00:35:29,122
What are you trying to say?

256
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:31,191
I think you still remember
Mr. Ho.

257
00:35:31,235 --> 00:35:33,169
He made you what you are
today.

258
00:35:33,203 --> 00:35:38,402
Could you ever forget him?

259
00:35:38,776 --> 00:35:42,974
Ho disappeared in Holland
3 years ago.

260
00:35:43,013 --> 00:35:45,709
I miss him very much.

261
00:35:45,749 --> 00:35:47,944
If it weren't for him,

262
00:35:47,985 --> 00:35:51,682
I wouldn't have the success
I have today.

263
00:35:51,722 --> 00:35:55,385
You don't have to remind me.

264
00:36:12,242 --> 00:36:18,044
What is Ho's relationship
to you?

265
00:36:18,282 --> 00:36:20,250
More than ten years ago,

266
00:36:20,284 --> 00:36:23,082
when Ho was just starting
out,

267
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,578
he came into the bar one
night.

268
00:36:26,623 --> 00:36:28,853
I was singing in the bar
at the time.

269
00:36:28,892 --> 00:36:30,257
I thought...

270
00:36:30,294 --> 00:36:32,125
just one man against ten...

271
00:36:32,162 --> 00:36:34,892
I acted on impulse and
grabbed a knife.

272
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:37,457
I saved his life.

273
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:38,968
Afterwards,

274
00:36:39,002 --> 00:36:41,994
I travelled the world with
him.

275
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:44,473
We were together a long time

276
00:36:44,508 --> 00:36:46,533
He was not only my lover,

277
00:36:46,577 --> 00:36:49,671
but also my confidante.

278
00:36:51,482 --> 00:36:52,915
Now,

279
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,111
his enemies are out to kill
him,

280
00:36:55,152 --> 00:36:59,020
so he's disappeared for 3
years.

281
00:37:00,057 --> 00:37:03,390
Do you know what it feels
like...

282
00:37:03,427 --> 00:37:05,759
...too lose someone dear?

283
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:10,398
The dearest person to me is
my father.

284
00:37:10,434 --> 00:37:13,028
I don't know what's happened
to him.

285
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,665
Nobody knows if he's alive
or dead.

286
00:37:16,774 --> 00:37:21,006
All these years, everything
I've done...

287
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:22,875
has been for my uncle and
my cousin Mun.

288
00:37:22,913 --> 00:37:25,006
I don't dare have any hopes
for myself.

289
00:37:25,048 --> 00:37:26,879
I only know...

290
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:28,509
the bigger the hopes,

291
00:37:28,552 --> 00:37:31,885
the greater the
disappointment.

292
00:37:36,794 --> 00:37:39,319
Actually, hopes are just
a big gamble.

293
00:37:39,363 --> 00:37:41,456
If you lose, it's very
painful.

294
00:37:41,498 --> 00:37:44,092
I'd rather not even try.

295
00:37:49,406 --> 00:37:51,806
Before, when I was poor...

296
00:37:51,842 --> 00:37:56,176
I just wanted to make it
big.

297
00:37:56,213 --> 00:37:58,545
Now,

298
00:37:58,582 --> 00:38:01,380
I have money, position,

299
00:38:01,418 --> 00:38:05,445
everything but a close
friend.

300
00:38:06,623 --> 00:38:10,889
It's hard to make it to the
top, but impossible to

301
00:38:10,928 --> 00:38:12,225
go back.

302
00:38:12,262 --> 00:38:15,527
There are many things, I can
look back & observe,

303
00:38:15,566 --> 00:38:17,830
but I can't go back.

304
00:38:18,068 --> 00:38:20,036
Since you don't expect too
much,

305
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,630
you should be happier than
me.

306
00:38:24,408 --> 00:38:26,603
It's been a long time since
I talked so much

307
00:38:26,643 --> 00:38:29,043
Really?
- Yes

308
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,717
Later on, please don't cry

309
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,124
What's the use of going back

310
00:38:51,168 --> 00:38:53,898
In 1997 Hong Kong will be
handed over to China.

311
00:38:53,937 --> 00:38:56,667
We'll just have to come back
here.

312
00:38:56,707 --> 00:39:00,143
Vietnam has been at war for
many years.

313
00:39:00,177 --> 00:39:02,236
The situation here is no
worse than before.

314
00:39:02,312 --> 00:39:05,509
Uncle, it's 1974. 23 years
until 1997.

315
00:39:05,549 --> 00:39:06,641
That's a long time.

316
00:39:06,683 --> 00:39:08,878
Might as well go back for
a look.

317
00:39:08,952 --> 00:39:10,146
Yeah

318
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:13,348
Let's go.

319
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:17,053
It's all a matter of fate.

320
00:39:17,094 --> 00:39:19,392
Everthing is pre-ordained.

321
00:39:32,743 --> 00:39:35,541
Mark, the taxi's waiting.

322
00:39:39,116 --> 00:39:41,983
We're carrying a lot of cash
Will customs give us trouble

323
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:44,510
Don't worry. Kit knows those
guys.

324
00:39:44,588 --> 00:39:47,580
She'll arrange matters for
us at the airport.

325
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:52,927
The signboard has been here
for over 20 years.

326
00:39:52,963 --> 00:39:55,761
I can't bear to leave it
behind.

327
00:40:00,604 --> 00:40:02,196
Pat

328
00:40:09,947 --> 00:40:11,710
Be careful

329
00:40:11,748 --> 00:40:13,215
Pat

330
00:40:13,317 --> 00:40:15,114
The camera

331
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,311
Turn off the lights

332
00:40:22,192 --> 00:40:25,593
I almost forgot we weren't
coming back

333
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:33,602
Uncle, I'll pack it for you.

334
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:38,637
This money for you. Don't
waste it.

335
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:41,744
I'll come back when things
have settled down.

336
00:40:41,778 --> 00:40:44,679
Take good care of your
your health.

337
00:40:44,715 --> 00:40:49,550
Don't forget to close the
windows at night.

338
00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:53,716
Wipe away the dust when you
have time.

339
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:59,061
It's up to you to take care
of this big place.

340
00:41:00,998 --> 00:41:04,695
On clear days, take the
medicine out to dry.

341
00:41:04,901 --> 00:41:07,495
We're running out of time,
Dad. Hurry up.

342
00:41:07,537 --> 00:41:11,098
The taxi meter is running.
Let the medicine get mouldy.

343
00:41:11,174 --> 00:41:12,573
Why are you so reluctant to
leave this shop?

344
00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:14,133
I'll get you a new one in
Hong Kong.

345
00:41:14,177 --> 00:41:16,077
Does he even understand what
you're saying?

346
00:41:16,113 --> 00:41:20,550
He understands more than you
I looked at the sign,

347
00:41:20,584 --> 00:41:22,552
and he knew to take it down.

348
00:41:22,586 --> 00:41:24,247
Why didn't you take it down?

349
00:41:24,287 --> 00:41:25,686
So what if he took it down.

350
00:41:25,722 --> 00:41:27,690
Now it's up to me to get it
to the airport.

351
00:41:27,724 --> 00:41:30,022
Let's go The plane won't
wait for us.

352
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,688
Why are you so impatient?
Go by yourself.

353
00:41:32,729 --> 00:41:34,526
I'll tell Pat to hang it
back up.

354
00:41:34,564 --> 00:41:35,496
I'm not going.

355
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:37,466
I went to a lot of trouble
to get your exit permit

356
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:39,162
Don't make all of us miss
the plane

357
00:41:39,202 --> 00:41:41,397
If you still have
instruction on the medicine.

358
00:41:41,438 --> 00:41:42,996
You can write a detailed
letter from Hong Kong.

359
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,100
You have no sentiment for
the past

360
00:42:19,576 --> 00:42:22,374
Ok, I'm going.

361
00:42:52,676 --> 00:42:53,870

00:42:54,044 --> 00:42:57,013
I'll go in and get a luggage
cart. - Be careful

363
00:42:58,415 --> 00:42:59,882
This signboard has given me
lots of troubles.

364
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:01,816
Be careful with that
sigboard.

365
00:43:09,392 --> 00:43:10,654
Mun

366
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:13,052

It's a pleasure to see you.

369
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:20,698
Where's Mark?

370
00:43:20,737 --> 00:43:22,637
He went over there to look
for you.

371
00:43:22,672 --> 00:43:24,299
Kit, we've a lot of US
dollars on us.

372
00:43:24,341 --> 00:43:27,333
Will we have any problems?
- I'll find a way.

373
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,435
I'm mun's Dad.

374
00:43:29,479 --> 00:43:31,572
Uncle, I'm Chow Ying-kit.

375
00:43:31,615 --> 00:43:33,776
Miss Chow.
- Nice to meet you.

376
00:43:33,817 --> 00:43:35,580
I'll go look for Mark.

377
00:43:37,254 --> 00:43:41,122
Mun, is she the "last fling"

378
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:43,521
Dad, what do you mean by
"last fling"?

379
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,720
She's going with us.

380
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:46,922
Don't jinx us by saying
unlucky things.

381
00:43:46,963 --> 00:43:48,692
Wait for me here.

382
00:43:49,332 --> 00:43:51,323
Kit

383
00:43:55,472 --> 00:43:56,803
What's the matter?

384
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,104
There are a lot of new
people in Customs.

385
00:43:59,142 --> 00:44:00,973
Don't worry, it'll be Ok.

386
00:44:01,011 --> 00:44:03,377
I'll take a look to see
whether I know such people.

387
00:44:03,413 --> 00:44:05,108
Get in line first.

388
00:44:18,628 --> 00:44:19,492
Don't push

389
00:44:19,529 --> 00:44:22,293
Don't take too long. Time
to board the plane.

390
00:44:35,345 --> 00:44:38,712
Officer, have a drink on me

391
00:44:38,748 --> 00:44:39,874
Trying to bribe me?

392
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:41,577
Just what do you think you
are trying to do?

393
00:44:41,618 --> 00:44:42,744
Get out of the way

394
00:44:42,786 --> 00:44:44,811
He has heart trouble
Don't push him.

395
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,297
Dad

396
00:45:05,575 --> 00:45:06,564
Uncle

397
00:45:08,078 --> 00:45:10,103
Don't ruin it

398
00:45:14,517 --> 00:45:15,211
Dad

399
00:45:15,252 --> 00:45:16,241
Uncle

400
00:45:17,921 --> 00:45:20,515
Hurry Help him sit down.
- Dad, where's your medicine?

401
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:21,884
Dad

402
00:45:32,435 --> 00:45:33,299
Uncle

403
00:45:33,336 --> 00:45:35,566
Mun, hurry up.

404
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:40,770
Passengers on Flight 175,
please board immediately.

405
00:45:42,178 --> 00:45:44,112
I'm afraid I won't make it.

406
00:45:44,147 --> 00:45:48,049
You'll make it to Hong Kong
for sure, Uncle.

407
00:45:52,055 --> 00:45:54,785

Dad, how are you?

412
00:46:19,983 --> 00:46:21,109
Dad

413
00:46:37,233 --> 00:46:39,565
He took our passports

414
00:46:52,882 --> 00:46:54,315
Take care of him

415
00:46:55,785 --> 00:46:57,150
Mark

416
00:46:58,121 --> 00:47:00,112
Don't

417
00:47:20,143 --> 00:47:22,008
Get up Acting to be pityful

418
00:47:22,112 --> 00:47:23,704
Come on

419
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:27,880
Get up Acting like a dog

420
00:47:28,685 --> 00:47:30,277
Dad, you're alright?

422
00:47:32,422 --> 00:47:35,721
We'll all die together.
Get up

423
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:37,281
Mark?

424
00:47:38,962 --> 00:47:40,930
Hit me Hit me

425
00:47:41,164 --> 00:47:42,222
Come on

426
00:47:42,799 --> 00:47:45,267
He's... He's repacking the
suitcases.

427
00:47:46,002 --> 00:47:48,402
Can we go?

428
00:47:49,305 --> 00:47:53,241
Very soon We'll be back
in Hong Kong soon.

429
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:10,685
Kit

430
00:48:29,612 --> 00:48:30,977
You're Ok?

431
00:48:31,114 --> 00:48:31,910
Fine

432
00:48:32,015 --> 00:48:33,243
Better get on the plane
fast

433
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:34,077
What about you?

434
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:36,311
I have to stay behind as a
witness.

435
00:48:37,187 --> 00:48:38,381
Uncle

436
00:48:40,023 --> 00:48:41,718
Go with your mind at ease.

437
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:43,449
You won't have to be
subjected to this anymore.

438
00:48:43,593 --> 00:48:45,151
We accussd the Customs
officer of corruption,

439
00:48:45,228 --> 00:48:47,992
so I have to stay here and
be a witness in court.

440
00:48:48,264 --> 00:48:51,290
We'll all meet again in
Hong Kong.

441
00:49:09,085 --> 00:49:11,246
Take care

442
00:49:11,888 --> 00:49:12,877
You, too.

443
00:49:36,146 --> 00:49:39,172
Hurry up and get on the
plane

444
00:50:51,221 --> 00:50:53,655
Due to the Watergate
incident, the U.S. Congress

445
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:56,056
has requested President
Nixon's resignation.

446
00:50:56,092 --> 00:50:58,322
According to observers,
after Nixon resigns,

447
00:50:58,361 --> 00:51:00,795
the situation in Vietnam
will be worsen.

448
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,354
But the South Vietnamese
government emphasizes

449
00:51:02,398 --> 00:51:04,366
they have confidence in
current situation.

450
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,460
And will continue their
liberal economic policies.

451
00:51:07,503 --> 00:51:09,403
Next Monday, the President
of Vietnam

452
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,634
will convene an emergency
meeting...

453
00:51:11,674 --> 00:51:13,665
...to deal fairly and
impartially...

454
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,678
...with the serious problem
of corruption.

455
00:51:15,712 --> 00:51:17,270
He pledges to the National
Council...

456
00:51:17,313 --> 00:51:18,575
...that the government will
be cleaned up.

457
00:51:19,916 --> 00:51:21,508
Get out of the way

458
00:51:21,684 --> 00:51:23,151
Stand to the side

459
00:51:23,486 --> 00:51:24,953
Reuters reports a fierce
aerial attack...

460
00:51:24,988 --> 00:51:26,785
...on South Vietnam last
Sunday.

461
00:51:26,823 --> 00:51:29,018
Casualty figures are still
unavailable.

462
00:51:29,058 --> 00:51:31,356
Due to the current
instability in Vietnam,

463
00:51:31,394 --> 00:51:33,862
many Vietnamese boat people
have arrived...

464
00:51:33,896 --> 00:51:36,228
in Hong Kong during the past
few days.

465
00:51:36,266 --> 00:51:37,927
The Hong Kong government
and the UN...

466
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:41,061
...are conducting
discussions over ways...

467
00:51:41,104 --> 00:51:43,334
...to humanely solve the
refugee problems.

468
00:51:43,506 --> 00:51:45,565
I told you they were
finished

469
00:51:45,608 --> 00:51:47,701
It's a good thing we left
when we did

470
00:51:47,844 --> 00:51:51,871
So what? We still lost our
home

471
00:52:03,192 --> 00:52:07,788
Cousin Mark, if there's
anything I've done wrongly,

472
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:09,127
please forgive me

473
00:52:09,265 --> 00:52:12,723
Don't be silly I got mad
just now. Don't bother me.

474
00:52:12,935 --> 00:52:16,837
You'll be getting hungry as
you don't take dinner.

475
00:52:16,973 --> 00:52:19,066
Have a bowl of soup, please.

476
00:52:19,175 --> 00:52:20,699
Thank you.

477
00:52:38,828 --> 00:52:41,763
Vietnam is in chaos.
I wonder how Kit is?

478
00:52:42,632 --> 00:52:44,122
I hope she's OK.

479
00:52:45,635 --> 00:52:48,297
We still haven't had any
news about her.

480
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:52,606
Cousin Mark

481
00:52:52,642 --> 00:52:54,974
There's a car outside with
a flat tire.

482
00:52:55,011 --> 00:52:56,911
You want to repair it?

483
00:52:57,347 --> 00:52:59,611
Let me take a look.

484
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:16,230
Hey, friend Which tire
is flat?

485
00:53:58,441 --> 00:53:59,874
Mun

486
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:01,877
Mun

487
00:54:02,044 --> 00:54:03,978
Mun Look who's here

488
00:54:04,013 --> 00:54:06,573
Mun

489
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:08,508
Mun

490
00:54:08,618 --> 00:54:10,347
What's the matter? Can't
fix it?

491
00:54:10,386 --> 00:54:11,751
Tell him to leave it here.

492
00:54:11,788 --> 00:54:13,278
Look who's come

493
00:54:14,357 --> 00:54:15,289
Who?

494
00:54:20,963 --> 00:54:22,521
Kit

495
00:54:27,637 --> 00:54:30,367
I thought I'd have to go
to Saigon to find you

496
00:54:33,176 --> 00:54:35,736
Mark and I talk about you
all day and night.

497
00:54:38,347 --> 00:54:40,713
I mussed your hair

498
00:54:42,385 --> 00:54:47,049
Great The family has been
reunited.

499
00:54:47,757 --> 00:54:48,883
Uncle

500
00:54:48,991 --> 00:54:49,923
Dad

501
00:54:50,026 --> 00:54:54,429
Mun goes to the airport
everyday to wait for you.

502
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:57,724
Mark, take her things inside

503
00:54:57,867 --> 00:55:00,495
Uncle, she has her own home.

504
00:55:00,603 --> 00:55:03,197
How can you ask her to
move in here?

505
00:55:03,306 --> 00:55:06,104
Lt'll happen sooner or later

506
00:55:16,953 --> 00:55:19,751
Sorry. I've sweaty palms.

507
00:55:19,922 --> 00:55:23,585
How do you know the night
club manager?

508
00:55:23,759 --> 00:55:25,420
Our company has shares in
this place.

509
00:55:25,528 --> 00:55:28,053
Evergreen invests in
everything

510
00:55:36,706 --> 00:55:39,072
Excuse me, boss woman

511
00:55:42,211 --> 00:55:45,112
Six, seven, eight

512
00:55:45,281 --> 00:55:46,475
Sit down

513
00:55:46,649 --> 00:55:49,015
Don't be bashful. Sit down

00:55:49,151 --> 00:55:51,551
Let me introduce you. This
is my cousin, Mun.

515
00:55:52,889 --> 00:55:56,825
Mark, let's just sit and
chat.

516
00:55:56,859 --> 00:55:58,554
No need for so many
hostesses.

517
00:55:59,262 --> 00:56:01,230
Silly In this kind of a
place,

518
00:56:01,297 --> 00:56:03,322
how can you not have
hostesses keep you company?

519
00:56:03,366 --> 00:56:04,833
Kit, you're the boss here.

520
00:56:04,867 --> 00:56:08,098
Why so few hostesses to
serve us?

521
00:56:08,137 --> 00:56:10,128
You're not a very good
friend

522
00:56:10,172 --> 00:56:11,537
Mr. Cheung, Miss Chow.

523
00:56:11,574 --> 00:56:12,734

Find out what Mr. Cheung
desires,

00:56:55,318 --> 00:56:58,219
and put it on my company's
bill.

Thanks a lot.

544
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:02,717
You can treat me whenever
I come here.

Have a good time. I'm
leaving now.

00:57:06,128 --> 00:57:08,358
Kit, I'll take you home.

547
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,192
Oh, so Mr. Cheung is a
friend of Miss Chow's.

00:57:15,905 --> 00:57:18,100
Miss Chow.
