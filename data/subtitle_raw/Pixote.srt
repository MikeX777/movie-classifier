1
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:06,090
This is a district of Sao Paulo.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,759
A large latin American industrial city...

3
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:12,596
...responsible for 60 to 70%...

4
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,099
...of this country's gross national product.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,478
Brazil has 120 million inhabitants...

6
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:22,398
...of which, 50% are under 21 years of age.

7
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:26,986
Of these, almost 28 million...

8
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:30,782
...live in conditions below the standards set forth...

9
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:35,579
...in the International Childrens Rights prescribed by the U.N.

10
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:39,499
There are also approximately 3 million homeless children...

11
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:44,588
...who have no one and no defined family of origin.

12
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:47,675
The situation of these children is more chaotic...

13
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:55,182
...when one is aware that they can't be prosecuted...

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,980
...which permits the exploitation of these minors by some adults.

15
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:05,401
Forcing them to commit crimes or acts of delinquency...

16
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:07,070
...knowing they won't be prosecuted.

17
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:09,698
At most they'll be sent to reformatories...

18
00:01:09,864 --> 00:01:12,701
...where they will spend several months; where the pressure...

19
00:01:12,784 --> 00:01:16,580
...and lack of space will cause their immediate release.

20
00:01:16,788 --> 00:01:20,501
This district here, is one, wherein live...

21
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:24,296
...the families of workers from large neighboring factories...

22
00:01:24,797 --> 00:01:29,593
...mom and dad who both work and children who remain at home...

23
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:35,266
...with care provided by an older sibling or a paid neighbor.

24
00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:39,896
Fernando, who plays the main character of "Pixote"...

25
00:01:40,104 --> 00:01:43,691
...Iives with his mom and 9 other siblings in this house.

26
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,905
This film is acted by children who belong to this social class.

27
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:10,177
The Survival of the Weakest

28
00:03:46,903 --> 00:03:50,282
O. K. Iove, that's crazy!

29
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:52,701
-I've been waiting an hour. Want me to give up the job?

30
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:57,873
-Just a minute longer, please.

31
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,795
I'll give you a call later on, okay? Bye.

32
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:05,381
My son has been missing for over a month.

33
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:07,591
That's another matter.

34
00:04:07,675 --> 00:04:10,678
Just give me his name for now.

35
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:12,013
José Maria.

36
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:14,891
-José Maria, what? -José Maria Da Silva.

37
00:04:30,407 --> 00:04:32,576
Get moving, all of you!

38
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:02,774
-What's up? -They're rounding everyone up.

39
00:05:02,982 --> 00:05:05,485
Some old guy was killed, they're pinning it on us.

40
00:05:06,402 --> 00:05:10,782
Pedro Socrates, 15 years old : father, Julio; mother, Ambrosia.

41
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:16,413

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,084
Joao Henrique, 10, Mother: Maria Da Costa, 35; Father: unknown.

43
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:24,588
-My father's dead! -Father: unknown!

44
00:05:24,713 --> 00:05:27,508

00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:45,485
Raimundo de Souza: Father, Pedro...

49
00:06:45,214 --> 00:06:48,509
What a mess. Everyone up.

50
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:51,512
Get in line.

51
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:07,195
Back again, eh? You know all about what's going on.

52
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:11,700
You don't get hit for no reason here.

53
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:16,705
Let's have some order here!

54
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:24,588
Inside you're a man, see?

55
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:30,594
Any trouble, and you'll answer to me.

56
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:35,600
-Any questions? -No questions.

57
00:07:35,892 --> 00:07:38,019
Sunday is visiting day.

58
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:43,191
No whores. Only family.

59
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:45,610
Get them to the dormitory.

60
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:48,196
Come on, quickly! Quick!

61
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,917
Quiet!

62
00:09:25,005 --> 00:09:26,507
Keep quiet!

63
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:31,095
It'll be O. K. if you keep quiet.

64
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:31,887
What the...?

65
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:14,599
I won't ask who's responsible!

66
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:16,809
No one will own up!

67
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,606
But hear this, I'm nobody's father!

68
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:24,192
I don't put up with any bullshit!

69
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:28,321
You want to kill each other, do it outside!

70
00:10:28,697 --> 00:10:30,824
Not here or I take the rap

71
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:33,118
This is a respectable house.

72
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:39,291
You tell me everything, or, I'll smash your heads in!

73
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:48,008
-Pixote, did you see who did it? -Not me. I was asleep.

74
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:56,517
Fucking hell! Get him to sick bay.

75
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:27,633
You're gonna look pretty.

76
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:30,594
Watch out for Lilica.

77
00:12:16,225 --> 00:12:19,437
Keep still! Got ants in your pants?

78
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:23,921
Hey! You're afraid.

79
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,925
Take a drag.

80
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:32,138
Breathe in and hold it.

81
00:13:33,014 --> 00:13:35,016
Right on!

82
00:13:41,731 --> 00:13:44,108
The smoke that satisfies.

83
00:13:50,824 --> 00:13:52,534
Go again.

84
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:19,228
Shit, man, I'm so hungry.

85
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:21,606
I'm spaced out.

86
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:26,027
It doesn't get to an old hand like me so easily.

87
00:15:18,123 --> 00:15:19,625
Let's split.

88
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:26,632
Pixote!

89
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,640
Fucking sexy chick!

90
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:18,019
My ass, she's a fag.

91
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,937
Lilica.

92
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,148
But I'd fuck it.

93
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,134
How's your memory?

94
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,512
That guy's Almir.

95
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,933
Son of a bitch cop.

96
00:16:57,226 --> 00:17:01,522
You pushed an old guy under a car the other day. He's dead!

97
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:03,524
Did you need to do this...

98
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:07,529
...just to rob his wallet!

99
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:13,952
The guy was some judge. Know what that means?

100
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,621
We sure fucked up.

101
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:18,916
How could we know he was important?

102
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,627
The Commissioner's got the screws on me.

103
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:25,631
The Chief Commissioner put the screws on the commissioner.

104
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,348
I want the names of who did it.

105
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:37,351
Nothing will happen to you.

106
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:41,940
Here, the law protects minors.

107
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:51,449
You're untouchable.

108
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:54,536
But I'm not taken in by this minors' business.

109
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:03,754
If you won't collaborate...

110
00:18:05,422 --> 00:18:09,552
I'll just finger one of you, then where will you be?

111
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,516
The old man died in lpiranga and 24th, the 24th of May.

112
00:18:16,017 --> 00:18:17,727
Who hangs out there?

113
00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:21,022
The guy doesn't know anything.

114
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,025
He died at the block, not at the corner...

115
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:27,153
...Iike this jerk just said.

116
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,828
Talk faggot! Tell us! Speak up, you whore!

117
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:40,042
Your lips are sealed, eh?

118
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:42,920
One good turn deserves another.

119
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:47,049
When we get out of here no one will stop us.

120
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:49,844
-Got it, pal? -Got it.

121
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:59,854
Start scrubbing, you pigs. Let's get this dirt off you.

122
00:19:00,146 --> 00:19:03,524
Get rid of the lice.

123
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:07,237
And you, darling...

124
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:10,824
...get your pussy nice and clean.

125
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,752
What are you staring at?

126
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,254
You like it?

127
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:28,551
You want to touch it?

128
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:03,629
Sit here.

129
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:06,548
Are you new here?

130
00:20:13,931 --> 00:20:16,642
Boy, I coughed all night!

131
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:26,653
Drink up, before it gets cold.

132
00:20:27,946 --> 00:20:29,322
You'd better.

133
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:32,659
You'll only have to drink it tomorrow.

134
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:47,341
You're gonna be nice and strong when you grow up.

135
00:20:51,637 --> 00:20:52,763
The...

136
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,142
...world...

137
00:20:57,351 --> 00:20:58,644
..is...

138
00:20:59,062 --> 00:21:02,649
...round...

139
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:06,152
...Iike...

140
00:21:07,362 --> 00:21:08,655
...an...

141
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:14,035
...orange.

142
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:23,629
Have you written that? Why aren't you writing?

143
00:21:25,464 --> 00:21:28,634
Open your book. Too tired to do it?

144
00:21:28,926 --> 00:21:33,139
Well, you must learn to write, to know things.

145
00:21:33,347 --> 00:21:37,643
Come on, wake up, will you!

146
00:21:40,855 --> 00:21:42,357
Start writing.

147
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,969
Fess up!

148
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:51,762
I know nothing.

149
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:53,431
Come clean, you son of a bitch!

150
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:57,435
How can I tell you what I don't know, shit?

151
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,645
No swearing allowed here, asshole!

152
00:23:02,065 --> 00:23:03,733
You'd better talk.

153
00:23:04,943 --> 00:23:08,154
I can wait all day. I'm in no hurry.

154
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:12,242
You'll tell us in the end, anyway. So talk!

155
00:23:12,951 --> 00:23:17,456
Okay, okay, I'll talk. It's like this...

156
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:21,251
...I met two guys on the street.

157
00:23:22,044 --> 00:23:25,130
They asked me for a cigarette, and I gave 'em one.

158
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,970
-Marijuana, right? -No, just a plain cigarette.

159
00:23:32,138 --> 00:23:36,350
Then they asked me if I 'd ever been involved in a hold-up.

160
00:23:37,268 --> 00:23:44,150
I said, yes, and they gave me a gun, and we went to the bank.

161
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:49,531
There were two guys there...

162
00:23:51,032 --> 00:23:52,450
...taking money out.

163
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:03,253
I'd like a loan.

164
00:24:03,337 --> 00:24:05,673
-How much do you want -800.

165
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:23,858
-Hand over the money! -We need it.

166
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:25,652
There isn't much. It's early.

167
00:24:25,735 --> 00:24:30,073
What do you care? It isn't yours, hand it over.

168
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,160
-Quick, before someone comes! -Please, don't kill me!

169
00:24:33,243 --> 00:24:35,537
I'll blow you away!

170
00:24:35,662 --> 00:24:37,247
In the bag, quick!

171
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:41,752
Stop, Dito!

172
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:44,546
Shit I quit playing!

173
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:52,263
Pixote screwed it all up. He blurted out my name!

174
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,561
Piss off!

175
00:25:04,651 --> 00:25:09,239
Cut it out. I've got something more interesting for you.

176
00:25:10,657 --> 00:25:12,868
Naked women!

177
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:19,249
Imagine taking down her panties and putting it in her.

178
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,043
Pixote's blushing.

179
00:25:21,168 --> 00:25:26,674
-Enough, that's not for kids. -Shit, Lilica!

180
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:28,676
It's already hard.

181
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:33,055
There it is you jerk offs.

182
00:25:35,641 --> 00:25:38,644
You act like big men but you have tiny weenies.

183
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:47,153
You, who are still on mother's milk, can do me a favor.

184
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:52,158
Stop it, only big boys can do that.

185
00:25:55,078 --> 00:25:57,539
I need a little favor from you.

186
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:02,461
On Sunday your folks might bring me some...

187
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:09,176
-Don't want much, do you? -I don't want any trouble.

188
00:26:09,343 --> 00:26:12,763
It's easy for you, isn't it?

189
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:17,852
-Don't ask me! -I know I could bring it.

190
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:23,650
But what's in it for me?

191
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:32,659
No one will rape you, nor beat you up.

192
00:26:33,368 --> 00:26:35,871
We'll make sure of that.

193
00:26:36,872 --> 00:26:38,665
Could you want more?

194
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:49,176
There's just one other thing.

195
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,973
-I want cash. -Bug off, fairy.

196
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:55,349
Let's play soccer.

197
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,942
Think about it, eh?

198
00:27:04,275 --> 00:27:07,570
I just told you I don't want trouble.

199
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:20,959
If you want a copy of today's message...

200
00:27:21,168 --> 00:27:26,674
...ask for number 1,720 and for the theme...

201
00:27:26,757 --> 00:27:29,969
...Jesus, the king who bestows happiness.

202
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:06,048
Go talk to the judge, mom.

203
00:28:06,674 --> 00:28:11,554
I will son, but I'm sure he won't let you out.

204
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:16,267
What for? So you can go back on the streets again?

205
00:28:16,976 --> 00:28:20,355
If anything happens to me in this hell hole...

206
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,065
...it'll be your fault.

207
00:28:22,982 --> 00:28:25,276
What could happen?

208
00:28:28,154 --> 00:28:32,659
If your Grandpa turns up, will you talk to him?

209
00:28:32,784 --> 00:28:36,663
-I sure hope he doesn't! -Why?

210
00:28:37,456 --> 00:28:39,082
He pisses me off!

211
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:45,547
Come here, Roberto.

212
00:28:49,176 --> 00:28:51,554
Today's my big day.

213
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:53,055
See Fumaca's mother?

214
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,768
Never misses a visit, you'd think she likes it here.

215
00:28:58,352 --> 00:29:02,774
That's right. Ugly old bat.

216
00:29:02,982 --> 00:29:04,859
Looks like she brought him something.

217
00:29:05,068 --> 00:29:06,778
Maybe it's coconut pie.

218
00:29:06,861 --> 00:29:09,781
The last one she brought was great.

219
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,956
Dito, your mom wants to see you, c'mon.

220
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:19,458
I don't wanna see her!

221
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:23,462
-She came all this way to see you. -I didn't ask her to!

222
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,465
C'mon, Sapato told me to get you.

223
00:29:26,674 --> 00:29:29,677
Tell that cow I want nothing to do with her!

224
00:29:39,687 --> 00:29:43,650
You won't talk to your mom? Ingrate.

225
00:29:43,775 --> 00:29:46,653
She sacrifices for you. Now go see her.

226
00:29:55,662 --> 00:29:58,665
-Can I go? -Yeah, go on, Dito.

227
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:15,683
When did he arrive?

228
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:21,689
About 2 months ago, I guess.

229
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:26,986
-Almost kicked him to death. -Why don't you ever come home?

230
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:31,157
-You don't turn me on anymore. -I don't?

231
00:30:45,673 --> 00:30:47,967
Ever since I was a kid...

232
00:30:49,385 --> 00:30:52,680
...I did nothing but listen to you...

233
00:30:53,556 --> 00:30:56,684
...I followed your story...

234
00:30:57,977 --> 00:31:00,980
...I knew your glory...

235
00:31:01,856 --> 00:31:06,194
...I knew by heart...

236
00:31:06,861 --> 00:31:11,074
He's good. He really sounds like Roberto Carlos.

237
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:14,870
When he gets out he'll be a star.

238
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:19,374
And what about you?

239
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:24,880
Because I read...

240
00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:29,677
...in those star magazines...

241
00:31:30,678 --> 00:31:33,681
...that you had been...

242
00:31:35,057 --> 00:31:38,060
...a poor kid like me.

243
00:31:48,363 --> 00:31:49,990
But you know...

244
00:31:50,657 --> 00:31:53,285
...I didn't need to be told that...

245
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:58,290
...because it was written all over your face...

246
00:31:58,457 --> 00:32:01,668
...what you suffered, what you went through...

247
00:32:03,378 --> 00:32:06,674
...and what you lost.

248
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:13,681
Look, I'm in a jam. Can't you help me?

249
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,058
What sort of jam?

250
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,977
I need to get hold of a few joints.

251
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,396
What do you mean "joints"?

252
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,690
Just a few.

253
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,659
I won't get you anything. Don't make trouble.

254
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,996
You watch out for yourself, son.

255
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,958
I am...

256
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:45,089
...the Roberto Carlos of the poor.

257
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:52,972
I'm the boy who loved you and grew up...

258
00:32:55,099 --> 00:33:00,897
...I sing where you no longer can.

259
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:10,699
That's the destiny life has given me.

260
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:13,660
Why can't you be like him?

261
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,872
I can't sing.

262
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,667
Besides, you'd have to get me out of here!

263
00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:28,467
It's even worse out there. Now, let's watch the singer.

264
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:33,389
Since you won't get me joints, I'll look for my mom.

265
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:37,477
If you find her before I do, let me know.

266
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:40,563
In your footsteps...

267
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:44,567
...where you passed by.

268
00:34:18,394 --> 00:34:21,397
-Keep still. -Any other questions?

269
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:26,694
-Why did you leave home? -Granny nagged me, so I left.

270
00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:31,700
Look, I'm only trying to help you.

271
00:34:31,992 --> 00:34:35,704
But you have to trust me. Tell me everything.

272
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:39,666
If I do, you'll turn me over to the cops.

273
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:44,004
I'm not a cop. I'm a doctor.

274
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:46,298
Promise you won't tell the judge?

275
00:34:49,677 --> 00:34:53,305
I told you, I want you with the others.

276
00:34:54,682 --> 00:34:56,893
-What is it? -Transfer.

277
00:34:57,101 --> 00:34:59,103
We don't have his evaluation yet.

278
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,898
Not my problem. Let's go.

279
00:35:01,981 --> 00:35:04,567
I still haven't told her everything.

280
00:35:04,984 --> 00:35:08,988
If she doesn't know, how will the judge let me out?

281
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:27,675
There's another lady there.

282
00:35:28,968 --> 00:35:31,679
Everything you said is kept confidential.

283
00:35:31,804 --> 00:35:33,889
Go. Obey, Mr. Sapato.

284
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:49,990
Almir, I don't want any trouble.

285
00:35:50,073 --> 00:35:51,992
I want those kids back in 3 days.

286
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:55,203
Relax, I always bring them back.

287
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:58,373
Sure, but some of your colleagues haven't.

288
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:02,586
-And I take the rap. -Don't panic.

289
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:06,590
If anyone asks, they're on vacation.

290
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:29,698
What are you looking at? Get a move on.

291
00:36:30,991 --> 00:36:32,075
Hurry!

292
00:36:38,707 --> 00:36:40,000
Help!

293
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:42,586
No! Help!

294
00:37:09,698 --> 00:37:13,201
I don't know. Could be any of them.

295
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,998
I only remember he was a blond.

296
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:24,004
They all look the same. How can I be sure?

297
00:37:26,298 --> 00:37:29,885
You say he looked like that blond one?

298
00:37:30,594 --> 00:37:32,680
He's already committed a homicide.

299
00:37:32,805 --> 00:37:36,100
Could be, but I only saw him for a second.

300
00:37:36,183 --> 00:37:37,310
I can't be certain.

301
00:37:37,477 --> 00:37:40,104
It's him all right. He's a wild one.

302
00:37:40,396 --> 00:37:43,691
You seem certain. I cannot be sure.

303
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:46,903
Let's go. It won't bring father back.

304
00:37:46,986 --> 00:37:51,783
I know it's painful, but it's still part of our job.

305
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:45,714
What's your name, kid?

306
00:38:47,007 --> 00:38:48,592
I like it.

307
00:39:03,983 --> 00:39:07,278
Have you seen my son? You know him?

308
00:39:07,695 --> 00:39:08,988
Fumaca

309
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:13,285
Do you know where he is?

310
00:39:15,287 --> 00:39:16,580
Is he sick?

311
00:39:23,003 --> 00:39:25,005
Has something happened to him?

312
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:34,181
They took away a bunch of guys...

313
00:39:34,307 --> 00:39:36,100
...and Fumaca hasn't returned yet.

314
00:39:36,183 --> 00:39:38,895
You'd better inquire further.

315
00:39:39,103 --> 00:39:42,899
Lady, better make yourself another son...

316
00:39:42,982 --> 00:39:44,817
...Cause that one's had it!

317
00:39:48,697 --> 00:39:55,704
The bodies of 2 boys, of about 14 to 15, have been found.

318
00:39:55,787 --> 00:40:00,709
The victims were riddled with bulletholes.

319
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:04,004
The authorities are at this moment...

320
00:40:04,213 --> 00:40:07,383
...going around to all city reform schools...

321
00:40:07,591 --> 00:40:14,098
...the only clue was the drill uniforms they are wearing.

322
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:17,685
Let's go! Quick!

323
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,688
Get dressed and out!

324
00:40:24,484 --> 00:40:28,405
We have visitors. Keep your traps shut, or you're back here!

325
00:41:05,193 --> 00:41:07,612
This is the dormitory wing.

326
00:41:08,405 --> 00:41:10,907
We work miracles with our small budget.

327
00:41:11,116 --> 00:41:13,702
That explains the conditions.

328
00:41:14,995 --> 00:41:19,791
-Are the children locked up? -No, it's not like that anymore.

329
00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:28,425
This is our chief supervisor, he is dedicated to his boys.

330
00:41:28,509 --> 00:41:35,391
Excuse the mess, it is difficult to clean all day long.

331
00:41:35,892 --> 00:41:37,393
And that boy?

332
00:41:39,604 --> 00:41:42,607
-Shouldn't he be in school? -No, he is sick.

333
00:41:45,026 --> 00:41:46,903
Infectious Hepatitis.

334
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,493
Son, how are you getting along here?

335
00:41:53,994 --> 00:41:56,121
The doctor comes twice a week.

336
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:03,003
Did the mother see the boy in the infirmary, or not?

337
00:42:03,212 --> 00:42:04,588
Sure she did

338
00:42:04,797 --> 00:42:07,091
She said she'd been here Sunday.

339
00:42:07,216 --> 00:42:09,510
She was told the boy had run away.

340
00:42:09,718 --> 00:42:11,721
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

341
00:42:11,804 --> 00:42:13,723
I took her to the infirmary myself.

342
00:42:13,889 --> 00:42:17,018
She was shocked, naturally...

343
00:42:17,226 --> 00:42:19,312
...considering the state he was in.

344
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,026
She knew the police had been here and had taken the boy away.

345
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,903
But the police never returned.

346
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:31,491
When boys fight, they are worse than adults.

347
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:36,413
Could one boy attack another with such violence?

348
00:42:36,705 --> 00:42:39,207
Only if he was King Kong.

349
00:42:39,499 --> 00:42:42,294
When he's better, you can talk to him.

350
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:47,299
We'd like the press to spend some time here...

351
00:42:47,508 --> 00:42:50,302
...to acknowledge the valuable work we do.

352
00:43:12,993 --> 00:43:18,707
Pixote, you're here! Where's Fumaca?

353
00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:22,920
They took us away somewhere and worked him over.

354
00:43:23,212 --> 00:43:28,008
-They said, he'd killed that old man. -His mother was here on Sunday.

355
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:32,221
She blew up when she found out they'd taken Fumaca away.

356
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:35,224
She said she'd tell the papers.

357
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:37,226
It's gonna get rough.

358
00:43:37,393 --> 00:43:39,228
So, Pixote, tell us everything.

359
00:43:39,812 --> 00:43:45,527
Almir, that son of a bitch, drove off with some of the kids.

360
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:48,822
Carlinhos and Mirandinha, he killed them both.

361
00:43:50,407 --> 00:43:53,201
Then he took us to the police station...

362
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,996
...and stuck us in solitary.

363
00:43:57,706 --> 00:44:01,210
We were there for a long time. Sapato came and took me out...

364
00:44:01,418 --> 00:44:03,712
...and put me in fatigues.

365
00:44:06,131 --> 00:44:08,801
-I gotta get out of here. -Me too.

366
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:11,429
I saved a bit of glue for you.

367
00:44:12,221 --> 00:44:15,016
When you're through, get rid of the can.

368
00:44:15,224 --> 00:44:18,811
-Thanks. -Let's split.

369
00:44:21,731 --> 00:44:23,316
Hang in there, O. K.?

370
00:46:37,831 --> 00:46:39,917
The boy is in fine shape.

371
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,629
If he doesn't eat well, he's gonna "kick it. "

372
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:50,636
-lsn't that how they talk? -lt is.

373
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:53,243
Internal hemorrhage. It's what I feared.

374
00:47:54,035 --> 00:47:56,621
Weren't you caring for him? How did this happen?

375
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:59,625
As if...you give me this boy all busted up.

376
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:04,630
I did everything I could.

377
00:48:05,005 --> 00:48:07,216
Don't try to pin this on me!

378
00:48:09,009 --> 00:48:12,221
Cad! This will cost you your job, I swear.

379
00:48:12,346 --> 00:48:13,431
Did you have to turn the boy over?

380
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:16,017
I didn't turn him over. The police came for him.

381
00:48:16,142 --> 00:48:19,437
Scream at them. I had no part in it.

382
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:22,315
You accepted the boy in this condition?

383
00:48:23,232 --> 00:48:24,609
It was on my day off.

384
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:31,408
-You accepted him, then? -What should I have done?

385
00:48:31,741 --> 00:48:34,244
Nothing!

386
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:38,123
What I want is for all of you to go to hell!

387
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:43,629
The press will come down on us like a ton of bricks!

388
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,840
God, this is the last thing we needed!

389
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:56,142
-What's the kid doing here? -He's out of it.

390
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,228
He won't remember a thing.

391
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:02,148
I won't be blamed!

392
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:05,610
I will put the blame on you!

393
00:49:15,746 --> 00:49:21,210
Make your own bed. Everybody has to pull together.

394
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:29,343
Come on, get dressed.

395
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:33,723
The doctor says you can go. Snap to it.

396
00:49:33,848 --> 00:49:36,017
Where's Fumaca? He was in that bed.

397
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:42,315
That's nonsense, kid. I don't know any Fumaca.

398
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,235
Swallow this.

399
00:50:28,238 --> 00:50:32,534
...drawn up by President Figueiredo...

400
00:50:37,622 --> 00:50:41,335
In São Paulo, violence on the streets increases daily...

401
00:50:41,543 --> 00:50:46,548
...at dawn the body of LCB was found.

402
00:50:46,715 --> 00:50:50,928
The Director of the lnstitute explained to our reporters:

403
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,016
Fights are frequent between the children...

404
00:50:55,224 --> 00:50:57,727
...mostly due to their social background...

405
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:02,523
...as for the case of the minor who was found dead.

406
00:51:03,733 --> 00:51:09,531
I have informed, that he had been brutally beaten up...

407
00:51:09,739 --> 00:51:11,741
...by one of his colleagues...

408
00:51:12,534 --> 00:51:15,746
...and that the attacker has been identified.

409
00:51:16,121 --> 00:51:21,126
His assailant, A.C., 17, has a police record...

410
00:51:21,335 --> 00:51:24,254
...of armed robbery, assault, and 1 homicide.

411
00:51:24,421 --> 00:51:27,216
A typical juvenile delinquent.

412
00:51:30,344 --> 00:51:35,433
I really don't know. I went and he wasn't there.

413
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:40,354
Then they told me he had run away.

414
00:51:41,356 --> 00:51:43,650
Then when I went to visit him...

415
00:51:44,025 --> 00:51:47,028
...they told me he was in the infirmary.

416
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:55,328
Then a boy told me it was a lie; that the police had got him.

417
00:51:56,830 --> 00:52:02,252
I don't know. I just want my son.

418
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:07,549
I think this institution is pretty mysterious.

419
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:14,056
This reporter saw him in the infirmary in a terrible state.

420
00:52:15,224 --> 00:52:18,144
He couldn't have taken a step. So how could he have run away?

421
00:52:20,521 --> 00:52:23,858
Everyone get to bed.

422
00:52:24,025 --> 00:52:27,028
Shit, you want to destroy me?!

423
00:52:27,529 --> 00:52:29,239
But it won't be like that.!

424
00:52:29,948 --> 00:52:33,243
You scum, you think you can get rid of me?!

425
00:52:33,326 --> 00:52:35,454
But you're wrong, you hear?!

426
00:52:35,746 --> 00:52:38,457
That's quite enough for today!

427
00:52:38,749 --> 00:52:42,252
Sapato, you son of a bitch, I want to talk to you!

428
00:52:42,336 --> 00:52:43,921
Everyone to the dormitory!

429
00:52:45,047 --> 00:52:47,341
Everyone stay put!

430
00:52:50,845 --> 00:52:55,141
Come on, I 'm gonna bust your gut!

431
00:52:56,058 --> 00:52:57,643
I 'll cut you in pieces!

432
00:52:57,852 --> 00:53:02,357
Sapato, you swine, get your ass here!

433
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,944
I didn't hurt Fumaca! He was my friend!

434
00:53:07,654 --> 00:53:10,448
It was you and your gang of friends!

435
00:53:10,657 --> 00:53:12,033
You are stoned.

436
00:53:12,242 --> 00:53:14,744
You want my hide!

437
00:53:14,953 --> 00:53:16,621
Don't get carried away.

438
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:20,751
Even if you had done it, nothing will happen to you.

439
00:53:21,835 --> 00:53:25,923
You'll be 18 soon and everything will be fine.

440
00:53:27,424 --> 00:53:31,762
No one will bother you. You don't even exist.

441
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:35,725
There will be nothing on your record.

442
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:39,061
I wasn't even on duty yesterday.

443
00:53:41,731 --> 00:53:44,525
Keep cool, and everything will work out.

444
00:53:47,028 --> 00:53:49,823
Now, everybody get to bed!

445
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:11,137
-Why the rush? -Let me go! You want my hide!

446
00:54:38,332 --> 00:54:40,334
What's going on? Who's there?

447
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:58,352
What have they done to you?

448
00:54:59,937 --> 00:55:02,065
They got me, Lilica.

449
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,442
They finished me off.

450
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,737
They took me to the box.

451
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,740
They let me have it.

452
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:14,161
Really worked me over.

453
00:55:14,327 --> 00:55:17,831
Where are you hurt? Tell me, tell me.

454
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,251
Tell me, where did they hit you?

455
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,128
Everywhere.

456
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:31,929
Help me, Lilica.

457
00:55:32,054 --> 00:55:36,642
I'll help you, I'm here beside you.

458
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:39,937
I promise no one will lay a hand on you again.

459
00:55:40,146 --> 00:55:42,065
No one will harm you.

460
00:55:42,148 --> 00:55:44,651
-He's dying. -No he's not!

461
00:55:45,735 --> 00:55:50,240
You're my man. You're my love. You're my life.

462
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:55,036
I promise I'll always stay by your side.

463
00:55:55,245 --> 00:55:59,666
-He's dying! -He's NOT dying!

464
00:56:01,335 --> 00:56:04,630
You're not dying. You're gonna stay with me.

465
00:56:04,838 --> 00:56:07,633
I love you. I do.

466
00:56:28,947 --> 00:56:33,034
You'll pay for this you fucking swine!

467
00:56:33,368 --> 00:56:36,872
I'll kill all of you!

468
00:56:40,834 --> 00:56:44,254
I'll be the next one. Dito, let's split.

469
00:56:44,463 --> 00:56:46,131
Open this door!

470
00:56:47,341 --> 00:56:49,844
Let's destroy this shit hole.

471
00:56:56,142 --> 00:56:57,768
They want to kill me!

472
00:57:55,746 --> 00:57:58,665
Mr. Mario, I'm really very worried.

473
00:57:59,249 --> 00:58:00,667
How so?

474
00:58:01,752 --> 00:58:04,254
It was a kids rumble?

475
00:58:08,342 --> 00:58:12,263
-What was the dead kid into? -Deviates.

476
00:58:14,348 --> 00:58:17,643
If there is no suspect, find one.

477
00:58:18,144 --> 00:58:23,650
This will blow the whole thing wide open.

478
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:49,552
The 2nd death in less than 2 weeks.

479
00:58:49,677 --> 00:58:52,638
You can ask Almir about the first one.

480
00:58:53,848 --> 00:58:58,561
You know why, this country doesn't budge?

481
00:58:59,353 --> 00:59:01,439
Because it's full of idiots.

482
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:06,653
The judge has just arrived.

483
00:59:08,071 --> 00:59:10,949
Well let's get it over with.

484
00:59:11,866 --> 00:59:15,662
Tonight, a boy was killed.

485
00:59:16,955 --> 00:59:21,251
Tell me everything you know, as if telling your father.

486
00:59:22,252 --> 00:59:24,880
I'm here to help you.

487
00:59:25,756 --> 00:59:28,259
Why all the destruction?

488
00:59:29,343 --> 00:59:31,679
Isn't this your home?

489
00:59:32,346 --> 00:59:34,765
A home we all ought to take care of.

490
00:59:35,975 --> 00:59:41,773
Why all this crazy fighting, even killing each other.

491
00:59:54,452 --> 01:00:00,751
You're here to reintegrate into society as useful citizens.

492
01:00:01,752 --> 01:00:04,755
You're missing the chance of a lifetime.

493
01:00:05,756 --> 01:00:07,049
Why?

494
01:00:11,178 --> 01:00:13,180
Can anyone tell me?

495
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:18,269
Can you?

496
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:31,283
I'll only leave here when I know the truth.

497
01:00:35,746 --> 01:00:39,249
Only God can give or take life away.

498
01:00:50,177 --> 01:00:53,180
They're all blind, deaf, and dumb.

499
01:00:58,478 --> 01:01:03,274
They're covering up because they all feel guilty.

500
01:01:18,373 --> 01:01:20,751
You're almost 18, aren't you?

501
01:01:23,086 --> 01:01:25,464
You were a friend of the victim?

502
01:01:27,258 --> 01:01:29,051
I knew him.

503
01:01:30,177 --> 01:01:34,056
-Tell me about him. -I have nothing to say.

504
01:01:34,765 --> 01:01:36,350
I know nothing.

505
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,354
-Want to talk in private? -What?

506
01:01:40,772 --> 01:01:43,858
You can talk. The judge will protect you.

507
01:01:44,984 --> 01:01:47,654
Why'd you do it? Did he betray you?

508
01:01:48,279 --> 01:01:50,073
Where you jealous?

509
01:01:50,782 --> 01:01:53,368
Go on, tell us!

510
01:01:54,661 --> 01:01:57,748
It's a lie! You're trying to frame me!

511
01:01:57,873 --> 01:02:02,377
Did you start it? Queer stuff, right or wrong?

512
01:02:02,753 --> 01:02:07,383
He hit you and that's how it happened, right?

513
01:02:07,466 --> 01:02:09,051
You animals!

514
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:12,179
You killed him, you disgusting fairy!

515
01:02:12,263 --> 01:02:13,389
Stop!

516
01:02:14,765 --> 01:02:16,183
Leave!

517
01:02:16,976 --> 01:02:18,352
Get out!

518
01:02:20,563 --> 01:02:21,773
Go!

519
01:02:44,755 --> 01:02:49,885
You can tell me, son. Don't be afraid.

520
01:03:39,759 --> 01:03:41,386
My God!

521
01:04:04,076 --> 01:04:05,661
That's the window!

522
01:04:11,584 --> 01:04:14,087
Freedom's outside.

523
01:04:16,464 --> 01:04:17,674
Let's go.

524
01:04:29,394 --> 01:04:31,063
C'mon, let's go, man!

525
01:04:37,903 --> 01:04:39,863
It's worse out there for me.

526
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:43,993
Idiot!

527
01:05:39,884 --> 01:05:41,803
Stop, thief!

528
01:07:04,597 --> 01:07:07,976
I love lying here in the sun.

529
01:07:12,105 --> 01:07:15,484
When I am with you, I feel so calm.

530
01:07:15,609 --> 01:07:16,902
And you?

531
01:07:20,406 --> 01:07:22,700
Imagine us in Copacabana.

532
01:07:22,783 --> 01:07:26,287
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

533
01:07:26,495 --> 01:07:29,790
Take all of us, Dito. Take us.

534
01:07:30,374 --> 01:07:35,171
I promise. When I make the big time...

535
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:38,675
...all four of us will go. - Awesome!

536
01:07:45,807 --> 01:07:49,978
I want to ask you something.

537
01:07:50,479 --> 01:07:51,772
Anything.

538
01:07:52,898 --> 01:07:56,401
- Do you like me? - Of course I do.

539
01:07:57,111 --> 01:07:58,696
Then say...

540
01:07:58,904 --> 01:08:01,991
...Lilica, I love you.

541
01:08:02,575 --> 01:08:05,703
- Cut it out, Lilica! - Say it, Dito.

542
01:08:08,289 --> 01:08:09,999
Don't fuck with me.

543
01:08:12,585 --> 01:08:14,712
Fuck with you, I will.

544
01:08:41,407 --> 01:08:42,992
Lilica.

545
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:14,816
Awesome. Long time, no see.

546
01:09:14,983 --> 01:09:17,903
What a surprise, get in.

547
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:20,114
I thought you had forgotten me!

548
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:24,702
Forgotten you? How could I forget you.

549
01:09:49,186 --> 01:09:53,106
You took your time! We've been here since 9.

550
01:10:05,703 --> 01:10:08,414
Go on, Lilica. Take it in.

551
01:10:13,085 --> 01:10:15,088
The peace pipe.

552
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:19,592
- It's all yours, Dito. - No, I don't do grass.

553
01:10:20,093 --> 01:10:22,387
Don't do grass?

554
01:10:23,596 --> 01:10:29,102
You only took a small hit. I don't care for non-smokers.

555
01:10:29,603 --> 01:10:32,481
If you think you're gonna sit here looking on...

556
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:38,904
- I just don't feel like it. - Don't feel like it, my ass.

557
01:10:39,488 --> 01:10:41,991
Show this crumb what it's all about.

558
01:10:42,408 --> 01:10:44,493
Suck in, man.

559
01:10:47,621 --> 01:10:51,292
Cristal, your car is really great.

560
01:10:53,085 --> 01:10:58,591
It is for me and my friends.

561
01:10:59,008 --> 01:11:01,010
But only my close ones.

562
01:12:02,408 --> 01:12:06,287
What do you think this is, man? Lemon pledge time?

563
01:12:06,495 --> 01:12:10,207
- Leave the kid alone, Cristal. - What are you thinking, queen?

564
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:13,211
What are you thinking, eh?

565
01:12:13,294 --> 01:12:14,420
Sorry.

566
01:12:14,504 --> 01:12:18,800
Sorry my ass! You ain't gonna watch anything!

567
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:23,304
You come here, drink my whiskey...

568
01:12:23,513 --> 01:12:25,390
...mess the place up...

569
01:12:25,515 --> 01:12:27,392
...watch this shitty film...

570
01:12:27,517 --> 01:12:31,188
What do you think I am, a hostess?

571
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:33,523
You've got it all wrong.

572
01:12:33,899 --> 01:12:36,819
Dito is just a kid.

573
01:12:37,027 --> 01:12:39,697
He doesn't know anything about this sort of thing.

574
01:12:39,989 --> 01:12:42,992
- Give him a break. - I won't even wish him luck.

575
01:12:43,409 --> 01:12:47,121
I'm wasting my time with these crumbs.

576
01:12:47,204 --> 01:12:51,501
You want to know something? I won't make no deal.

577
01:12:51,626 --> 01:12:55,713
So you can't get out, now!

578
01:13:02,011 --> 01:13:06,808
You can't do this. Dito worked his ass off to get the dough!

579
01:13:07,225 --> 01:13:11,104
That's not my problem. It's yours! Out!

580
01:13:11,313 --> 01:13:13,398
Just this favor.

581
01:13:13,607 --> 01:13:15,108
No, I won't.

582
01:13:25,619 --> 01:13:29,790
Let me talk to him for a while.

583
01:13:33,127 --> 01:13:35,129
Assholes!

584
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:46,224
Some is missing. There's 5,000 or so.

585
01:13:46,391 --> 01:13:48,393
I soon as I sell the stuff, lt'll be O.K.

586
01:13:48,602 --> 01:13:50,896
And where are you going to deal it?

587
01:13:51,104 --> 01:13:53,398
In Rio. I know the spots.

588
01:13:58,112 --> 01:14:00,531
I'm gonna save you some time.

589
01:14:00,614 --> 01:14:03,492
I don't do this for anyone, but I like you.

590
01:14:03,826 --> 01:14:07,830
When you get there, see my friend Debora.

591
01:14:08,205 --> 01:14:11,000
A fine chick with a large clientele.

592
01:14:11,209 --> 01:14:15,797
Take the stuff to her. Rio's a pretty bad place.

593
01:14:16,214 --> 01:14:20,426
If you can't find her look for Raulzinho at the cowboy club.

594
01:14:21,302 --> 01:14:24,097
- You know the place, don't you? - I know it.

595
01:14:24,306 --> 01:14:27,392
Get going then.

596
01:14:31,229 --> 01:14:33,398
And don't forget.

597
01:14:34,107 --> 01:14:36,318
You owe me 5 more grand.

598
01:14:38,112 --> 01:14:41,115
And no double-crossing.

599
01:14:41,323 --> 01:14:46,829
If you mess things up it'll cost double.

600
01:14:48,914 --> 01:14:53,002
This is your break. Either you deal...

601
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:57,423
...or you'll get dealt!

602
01:15:17,236 --> 01:15:20,614
Boy, am I hungry!

603
01:15:20,698 --> 01:15:26,412
Just pretend you are eating and you'll be O.K.

604
01:15:32,335 --> 01:15:35,630
Do you think we are on the wrong train?

605
01:15:35,713 --> 01:15:39,926
If we are, we'll get the right one.

606
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:43,013
We'll get there sooner or later.

607
01:16:05,536 --> 01:16:10,124
When I get my share, I'm gonna get a board like that.

608
01:16:13,127 --> 01:16:15,505
I'm not into that.

609
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:19,717
I'd like a stream where I can see the bottom.

610
01:16:19,801 --> 01:16:22,303
I spoke to the lady. She's nearby.

611
01:16:22,512 --> 01:16:25,223
Me and Lilica will go. You two stay here.

612
01:16:25,432 --> 01:16:30,437
Hey man, we're together. Why can't we go too?

613
01:16:30,604 --> 01:16:34,399
Yeah, Dito. I want to see the lady, if she's sexy.

614
01:16:34,608 --> 01:16:38,112
- O.K. Let's go. - C'mon Pixote.

615
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,006
It's good. I'll take it.

616
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,137
- How did you get here? - By train?

617
01:17:05,807 --> 01:17:10,103
What are you staring at? Think I'm pretty?

618
01:17:10,228 --> 01:17:11,229
I think.

619
01:17:16,235 --> 01:17:22,408
Cristal is still kicking? I thought he'd vanished.

620
01:17:23,826 --> 01:17:28,205
- Is this your first trip here? - Yeah, the first.

621
01:17:30,124 --> 01:17:33,127
Okay, that'll be 1 3,000.

622
01:17:34,837 --> 01:17:36,714
Did she say she lived here?

623
01:17:39,926 --> 01:17:41,803
Where does she sleep?

624
01:17:44,514 --> 01:17:46,516
No telephone; no nothing. It's empty.

625
01:17:51,104 --> 01:17:55,317
- Why? You don't trust me? - No, it's not that.

626
01:17:56,944 --> 01:17:59,113
Let's be friends.

627
01:17:59,321 --> 01:18:05,536
I'll take you home. I've got a son about your age.

628
01:18:06,412 --> 01:18:08,122
Wouldn't you like to play with him?

629
01:18:12,418 --> 01:18:16,214
This is for food, and the rest will come later.

630
01:18:17,215 --> 01:18:23,221
What? Don't you trust me? You've got my number.

631
01:18:23,805 --> 01:18:25,140
It's very simple.

632
01:18:25,307 --> 01:18:27,309
I'll take the stuff, take it to my friend...

633
01:18:27,517 --> 01:18:29,811
...he pays me, and I'll pay you.

634
01:18:32,439 --> 01:18:35,734
Or do you think I'd walk around with all that money?

635
01:18:37,444 --> 01:18:39,530
We won't leave without the dough!

636
01:18:39,738 --> 01:18:42,533
- I'm the boss, Lilica! - You're gonna get dealt.

637
01:18:42,616 --> 01:18:46,328
- Debora seems all right. - Keep out of this, Pixote!

638
01:18:47,413 --> 01:18:49,624
Okay, you know best.

639
01:18:49,832 --> 01:18:55,046
This is the way I work, if you don't want it, fine.

640
01:18:59,217 --> 01:19:01,719
How long would we have to wait?

641
01:19:01,928 --> 01:19:05,015
Jesus, I'll be back as soon as I can.

642
01:19:05,223 --> 01:19:08,435
But leave half the stuff for good faith.

643
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:27,830
The water is great, Lilica.

644
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:30,207
Don't splash, Chico.

645
01:19:35,546 --> 01:19:39,342
Didn't they teach you any manners at home?

646
01:19:39,425 --> 01:19:41,511
What home, Lilica? The brothel?

647
01:19:43,221 --> 01:19:46,933
Watch your mouth. My home was no brothel!

648
01:19:47,142 --> 01:19:49,144
Will you two quit fighting!

649
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:54,233
Shouldn't Debora be back by now?

650
01:19:54,316 --> 01:19:58,320
Maybe we'd better go back. Dito will be pissed.

651
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:04,034
We just got here. Why do we have to go now?

652
01:20:04,118 --> 01:20:07,121
I want to know if Dito's got the dough.

653
01:20:07,329 --> 01:20:10,416
I saw some great threads today, all embroidered.

654
01:20:11,834 --> 01:20:16,047
When I get my share, no one will mess with me.

655
01:20:16,214 --> 01:20:22,846
- I won't die like Big Boy. - Nobody knows the future.

656
01:20:23,513 --> 01:20:27,142
When I get my share of the take, Lilica...

657
01:20:27,517 --> 01:20:32,147
...l'm gonna buy a nice black.38 and you know what I'll do?

658
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:37,444
This is a hold up! Get 'em up, you bastard.

659
01:20:42,825 --> 01:20:46,120
That's how I'll treat those ass kickers.

660
01:20:46,829 --> 01:20:50,750
Everyone will respect me. Chico, the Trigger King.

661
01:20:55,838 --> 01:20:58,132
And know who'll be the first?

662
01:21:00,718 --> 01:21:05,140
The big-shot cop who beat me up at the station...

663
01:21:05,432 --> 01:21:09,227
...and I didn't even know why he was hitting me.

664
01:21:11,021 --> 01:21:13,231
But his day will come.

665
01:21:13,815 --> 01:21:17,152
That son of a bitch will pay.

666
01:21:20,948 --> 01:21:25,119
Roberto should be here with us.

667
01:21:27,538 --> 01:21:32,126
It'd be great if he were here.

668
01:21:32,335 --> 01:21:36,130
But he couldn't go in the water; his leg would rust.

669
01:21:45,849 --> 01:21:49,853
- I'll be 1 8 next month. - Getting old, eh? Lilica?

670
01:21:56,735 --> 01:22:01,532
Then the going will get rough. I'll have to cool it.

671
01:22:02,116 --> 01:22:05,453
If I'm caught, I'll be beaten and locked up forever.

672
01:22:07,121 --> 01:22:10,625
When I'm 18, I'll split.

673
01:22:11,918 --> 01:22:15,338
I'll see if Roberto will let me join his band.

674
01:22:16,339 --> 01:22:18,132
For me, things will be the same.

675
01:22:19,551 --> 01:22:22,637
They'll always be on my back.

676
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:25,724
They'll always find a way of messing me up.

677
01:22:34,358 --> 01:22:36,944
What can a queen expect from life?

678
01:22:39,238 --> 01:22:41,156
Nothing, Lilica.

679
01:23:40,552 --> 01:23:43,430
I knew that whore was double-crossing us.

680
01:23:44,431 --> 01:23:46,057
Fuck!

681
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:49,561
Son of a bitch!

682
01:23:51,355 --> 01:23:53,231
How did we ever get into this?

683
01:23:56,151 --> 01:23:58,362
You got us into this.

684
01:24:00,322 --> 01:24:03,158
Did I give her the stuff?

685
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:05,745
Wake up, will you?

686
01:24:05,828 --> 01:24:09,957
Aren't you the lay of that bastard, Cristal?

687
01:24:10,124 --> 01:24:11,834
How does Cristal come into this?

688
01:24:12,043 --> 01:24:15,338
Well, all you wanted was to make it with him.

689
01:24:15,463 --> 01:24:17,632
You took us along to show off.

690
01:24:19,634 --> 01:24:21,761
Baby's jealous, isn't he?

691
01:24:25,932 --> 01:24:28,643
I didn't do it to show off.

692
01:24:30,645 --> 01:24:32,147
I did it for you.

693
01:24:32,648 --> 01:24:36,652
One thing I hate is people cheating me.

694
01:24:37,361 --> 01:24:38,946
Business is business.

695
01:24:39,154 --> 01:24:41,657
- Yes, or no? - That depends.

696
01:24:42,658 --> 01:24:49,248
Some business requires a little cheating.

697
01:24:49,248 --> 01:24:53,461
Kiss off, Lilica! I never wanna see your face again!

698
01:24:53,836 --> 01:24:57,340
What's wrong with you? What's done is done.

699
01:24:58,925 --> 01:25:00,134
Just go!

700
01:25:01,845 --> 01:25:04,139
Really want me to go, Dito.

701
01:25:06,349 --> 01:25:10,854
Just repeat that and you won't see me again.

702
01:25:12,147 --> 01:25:16,860
Go on, say it! Repeat it!

703
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:12,460
Come here.

704
01:26:17,465 --> 01:26:20,343
It's okay. Raulzinho's waiting.

705
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:27,142
Not me, I wouldn't feel safe.

706
01:26:29,644 --> 01:26:34,233
If they're caught they can say they're begging, or something.

707
01:26:34,441 --> 01:26:36,151
I'll do it.

708
01:26:39,738 --> 01:26:43,450
Don't hand over the stuff without getting the cash.

709
01:26:43,659 --> 01:26:45,035
No "laters."

710
01:27:48,351 --> 01:27:53,065
No, I must go to Sao Paulo, on business.

711
01:27:53,273 --> 01:27:56,068
I'll be back in two days.

712
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:58,362
Who are you? What do you want?

713
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:01,365
We called you up. Cristal sent us.

714
01:28:01,573 --> 01:28:03,033
Yes, I know.

715
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:05,035
No, no, I'm here.

716
01:28:05,244 --> 01:28:06,454
Come in.

717
01:28:08,539 --> 01:28:10,041
No, I'll be back soon.

718
01:28:10,249 --> 01:28:11,834
Let me see the stuff.

719
01:28:16,464 --> 01:28:18,049
Put the shit over here!

720
01:28:22,554 --> 01:28:28,143
No, it's a private matter. I'll tell you later.

721
01:28:28,643 --> 01:28:29,770
Hang on.

722
01:28:29,936 --> 01:28:32,648
- How much? - 8,000 in cash.

723
01:28:32,856 --> 01:28:34,149
What the fu...?

724
01:28:35,442 --> 01:28:38,362
Okay, okay, hang on.

725
01:28:40,739 --> 01:28:44,160
Why the hell did you give it to him?

726
01:28:44,743 --> 01:28:48,039
Didn't you hear what Lilica said?

727
01:28:48,873 --> 01:28:51,667
What could I do?

728
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:53,961
He asked for it.

729
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:56,047
Just because he asked, you gave it?

730
01:28:56,339 --> 01:28:57,256
Hi there!

731
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:08,059
See who's there? That cow Debora.

732
01:29:08,268 --> 01:29:09,478
Let's go call Dito.

733
01:29:09,561 --> 01:29:13,440
No way, well take care of her ourselves.

734
01:29:15,442 --> 01:29:18,737
- What about the stuff? - We'll get it later.

735
01:29:18,946 --> 01:29:20,072
C'mon.

736
01:29:29,874 --> 01:29:32,168
Everything O.K. - Hi, boys.

737
01:29:41,553 --> 01:29:43,555
We came to get our money.

738
01:29:46,057 --> 01:29:48,143
We waited all day.

739
01:29:49,269 --> 01:29:52,147
I was held up in traffic.

740
01:29:53,148 --> 01:29:56,360
Glad you came. I've got the cash.

741
01:29:58,153 --> 01:30:02,867
You wait outside and after the show I'll pay you.

742
01:30:03,158 --> 01:30:04,243
No way!

743
01:30:04,451 --> 01:30:08,873
We're not gonna fall for that twice.

744
01:30:08,956 --> 01:30:10,875
We want it now, okay.

745
01:30:11,167 --> 01:30:14,670
Piss off! Leave, or I'll call the police!

746
01:30:14,879 --> 01:30:16,381
Then your bag goes with us!

747
01:30:43,158 --> 01:30:44,577
Speak to me!

748
01:30:45,077 --> 01:30:47,371
Speak to me, for God's sake!

749
01:31:49,853 --> 01:31:55,150
This is Dito, this is Pixote, all real nice people.

750
01:32:01,573 --> 01:32:05,786
Hey, take a look at that dark one over there.

751
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:12,585
- What do you think? - I like it.

752
01:32:16,172 --> 01:32:19,384
She's a love machine, man.

753
01:32:19,551 --> 01:32:23,179
1,000 a day, at least.

754
01:32:23,763 --> 01:32:27,183
I'll hand her over to you, because I'm going away.

755
01:32:27,559 --> 01:32:30,479
It's a bargain.

756
01:32:35,776 --> 01:32:37,069
Let's get to the point.

757
01:32:57,548 --> 01:32:59,384
Turn it off!

758
01:32:59,884 --> 01:33:02,470
We gotta talk.

759
01:33:02,762 --> 01:33:04,180
Close your eyes.

760
01:33:06,182 --> 01:33:08,185
You think I'm stupid?

761
01:33:08,852 --> 01:33:10,979
I was good to you, wasn't I?

762
01:33:11,188 --> 01:33:15,067
Sure, but you know I've got to cut out.

763
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:17,152
Only for a while.

764
01:33:18,654 --> 01:33:24,160
They're O.K., What's more, you said you'd agree with it.

765
01:33:25,077 --> 01:33:27,580
What am I gonna do with these kids?

766
01:33:27,955 --> 01:33:32,168
It's only for a while. I'll come straight back.

767
01:33:34,754 --> 01:33:37,173
Don't want to make trouble, do you, Sueli?

768
01:33:38,591 --> 01:33:42,679
Okay, forget it. Just let me rest.

769
01:33:47,183 --> 01:33:49,686
Hand over the 1,000, then...

770
01:33:59,863 --> 01:34:01,782
Easy, brother!

771
01:34:02,783 --> 01:34:05,786
This gun is great. It's brand new.

772
01:34:06,662 --> 01:34:08,581
You only need some bullets.

773
01:34:08,956 --> 01:34:12,460
Another 1,000 and it's yours, you'll need it.

774
01:34:12,668 --> 01:34:14,170
I've got one.

775
01:34:19,968 --> 01:34:23,680
- Like it? Do you want it? - Of course, I do.

776
01:34:25,181 --> 01:34:26,892
I'll take it for Pixote.

777
01:34:55,672 --> 01:34:57,465
What are you peeking at?

778
01:35:05,473 --> 01:35:06,975
You hurt?

779
01:35:10,687 --> 01:35:11,688
You sick?

780
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:15,192
I may be.

781
01:35:21,865 --> 01:35:23,784
Why are you staring?

782
01:35:25,077 --> 01:35:28,164
- Should I have kept the baby? - What baby?

783
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:31,375
That one!

784
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:37,173
What do you think that is? A steak?

785
01:35:41,886 --> 01:35:47,267
Didn't your mom tell you the facts of life? Even looks like you.

786
01:35:47,392 --> 01:35:49,060
Look at him!

787
01:35:52,981 --> 01:35:55,067
Stop staring at me!

788
01:35:59,863 --> 01:36:04,660
Get out, or I'll stick you like I stuck him! Go!

789
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,561
This goddamned fever...

790
01:36:32,064 --> 01:36:34,483
...won't it ever go away?

791
01:36:40,489 --> 01:36:45,786
There's blood in the bathroom, I think she's hurt.

792
01:36:46,579 --> 01:36:50,791
No, she's not hurt. She's menstruating.

793
01:36:51,667 --> 01:36:53,461
Didn't they ever tell you?

794
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:57,090
Every woman has it.

795
01:36:57,882 --> 01:37:01,761
Quiet, Lilica. I don't want fighting here.

796
01:37:08,685 --> 01:37:10,562
Why are you people so quiet?

797
01:37:12,189 --> 01:37:13,774
It's like a funeral.

798
01:37:17,486 --> 01:37:22,199
I'm sorry, but I'm not myself today.

799
01:37:39,801 --> 01:37:41,386
Anyone want some?

800
01:37:47,475 --> 01:37:49,770
I'll just give it to Lilica.

801
01:37:55,484 --> 01:37:58,278
You're of age now, right?

802
01:38:07,788 --> 01:38:10,082
Now I can see you better.

803
01:38:12,084 --> 01:38:14,587
If you know how, everything will be swell.

804
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:17,674
We'll divide the money in half.

805
01:38:18,174 --> 01:38:22,095
- In half! - Shut up, will you?!

806
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:25,390
You've got a deal!

807
01:38:25,765 --> 01:38:31,980
- This could put you in jail. - Don't worry, we're minors.

808
01:38:33,273 --> 01:38:36,693
There won't be any trouble.

809
01:38:40,072 --> 01:38:41,490
Of course.

810
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:45,369
So sure of yourself.

811
01:38:46,495 --> 01:38:49,081
eh, darling?

812
01:38:50,875 --> 01:38:52,794
Who are you trying to fool?

813
01:38:53,669 --> 01:38:56,506
The macho number doesn't add up with me.

814
01:38:58,007 --> 01:39:01,094
My last left a souvenir in the bathroom.

815
01:39:02,387 --> 01:39:03,680
You saw it, didn't you?

816
01:39:10,604 --> 01:39:13,690
- What did you say your name was? - Pixote.

817
01:39:16,401 --> 01:39:17,569
Pretty name.

818
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:22,700
Don't be angry with me.

819
01:39:24,368 --> 01:39:28,289
I'm on the edge today.

820
01:39:31,709 --> 01:39:33,795
They told me you are nice people.

821
01:39:36,172 --> 01:39:40,677
Pixote could be the man for me. How about it?

822
01:40:08,372 --> 01:40:11,500
Here we are.

823
01:40:12,793 --> 01:40:17,173
- Isn't it nice? - What a flea bag!

824
01:40:17,799 --> 01:40:20,176
I didn't expect a place like this!

825
01:40:20,385 --> 01:40:22,387
It's cheap.

826
01:40:22,887 --> 01:40:27,684
Anyway, for making love, it's the company that counts.

827
01:40:41,407 --> 01:40:44,910
What are you waiting for, pops?

828
01:40:46,704 --> 01:40:49,707
I thought you couldn't wait?

829
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,213
Lean back. Let me help you with your pants.

830
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:57,382
Shall I put some talc on it?

831
01:40:58,174 --> 01:41:00,301
Gimme your whole repertoire.

832
01:41:28,914 --> 01:41:32,210
- You're terrific. - So are you.

833
01:41:35,588 --> 01:41:38,383
Never seen anything nicer than you.

834
01:41:38,508 --> 01:41:40,510
I'm crazy about you.

835
01:41:50,812 --> 01:41:53,190
Okay, you motherfucker...

836
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:57,694
- Hand over the money! - Take the money...

837
01:41:57,986 --> 01:41:59,988
...but don't kill me, I have a family!

838
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:01,782
See if this makes you cum!

839
01:42:03,284 --> 01:42:06,787
Take everything, but don't kill me.

840
01:42:17,215 --> 01:42:19,884
What did you think of our performance?

841
01:42:20,093 --> 01:42:23,179
It was really great.

842
01:42:23,888 --> 01:42:26,308
Give me your meat, if you don't want it.

843
01:42:26,516 --> 01:42:30,896
You're like pigs! Take it!

844
01:42:32,689 --> 01:42:34,191
She's pissed off?

845
01:42:42,408 --> 01:42:46,495
- They're queers, aren't they? - Lilica likes cock...

846
01:42:46,495 --> 01:42:51,500
...but Dito doesn't. I know him. I can assure you.

847
01:42:52,919 --> 01:42:56,798
Now, I'll have a big chocolate ice cream.

848
01:42:59,217 --> 01:43:00,593
What about you?

849
01:43:02,387 --> 01:43:04,806
Cognac and marshmallow.

850
01:43:19,405 --> 01:43:20,489
Enjoying it?

851
01:43:20,698 --> 01:43:23,701
Well worth the money, eh?

852
01:43:24,410 --> 01:43:26,203
How much is a car like this?

853
01:43:27,621 --> 01:43:29,290
You're rich, eh?

854
01:43:29,707 --> 01:43:31,500
I want one.

855
01:43:34,587 --> 01:43:36,589
I want a car like this.

856
01:43:36,798 --> 01:43:42,095
I want a car like this one.

857
01:43:53,315 --> 01:43:55,192
Easy now, or I'll blow your brains out!

858
01:43:56,485 --> 01:43:59,822
Quiet, or I'll cut your balls off!

859
01:44:00,823 --> 01:44:01,907
Nice and quiet.

860
01:44:06,287 --> 01:44:08,205
Go on, get in there!

861
01:44:12,210 --> 01:44:14,295
I think he shit in his pants.

862
01:44:29,019 --> 01:44:31,897
- Everything okay? - Better and better.

863
01:44:41,824 --> 01:44:45,286
He beat me so hard, I ended up in the hospital.

864
01:44:46,203 --> 01:44:49,123
I told him, "Shove your money up your ass."

865
01:44:50,207 --> 01:44:53,795
"I'll have a house and a car all my own."

866
01:44:55,213 --> 01:44:57,799
Then I went to Sao Paulo, on my own.

867
01:44:58,925 --> 01:45:01,010
I worked in a nightclub.

868
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:07,392
It was great. I felt like a queen.

869
01:45:07,893 --> 01:45:10,520
I would dance all night.

870
01:45:11,104 --> 01:45:13,523
Change the music.

871
01:45:24,201 --> 01:45:27,204
Hey, I was enjoying that!

872
01:45:27,413 --> 01:45:30,207
Sueli told me too. She's great, eh?

873
01:45:32,126 --> 01:45:34,212
That's all I needed.

874
01:45:37,298 --> 01:45:38,299
Like it?

875
01:45:50,228 --> 01:45:51,813
What did you do there?

876
01:45:52,022 --> 01:45:57,110
I was a go-go girl. I had a bikini like this...

877
01:45:57,319 --> 01:45:58,695
...all covered with glitter.

878
01:45:58,904 --> 01:46:01,824
Smashing! Sort of heart shaped.

879
01:46:03,492 --> 01:46:05,828
I love dancing.

880
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:11,209
I used to dance all night on a stool like this.

881
01:46:41,031 --> 01:46:45,494
- Why did they throw you out? - That's a long story.

882
01:47:11,730 --> 01:47:15,108
This car is much nicer than Cristal's.

883
01:47:18,195 --> 01:47:20,197
Think the guy in back is hungry?

884
01:47:20,322 --> 01:47:23,200
Just leave me alone!

885
01:47:24,618 --> 01:47:29,332
What's up with you today? You're being so difficult.

886
01:47:29,624 --> 01:47:32,210
Nothing's the matter.

887
01:47:34,712 --> 01:47:36,714
I hate drunks!

888
01:47:36,923 --> 01:47:39,634
Look, she's drunk.

889
01:47:39,926 --> 01:47:41,803
No big deal.

890
01:47:42,595 --> 01:47:43,513
So what!

891
01:47:45,807 --> 01:47:50,312
- And stop talking trash! - I just don't like it.

892
01:47:51,229 --> 01:47:53,315
So, give me some money, and I'll go.

893
01:47:53,607 --> 01:47:55,526
Drop dead, you silly fag!

894
01:47:55,609 --> 01:47:59,113
Don't treat me this way.

895
01:47:59,321 --> 01:48:00,614
I'm gonna split.

896
01:48:00,823 --> 01:48:04,326
No one's leaving.

897
01:48:05,703 --> 01:48:11,500
Don't you like it here? What's wrong?

898
01:48:15,296 --> 01:48:17,215
Something upset you?

899
01:48:23,722 --> 01:48:25,807
Don't break up the party.

900
01:48:43,325 --> 01:48:46,829
Ever give anyone a French kiss?

901
01:48:49,999 --> 01:48:52,126
God, she's gross!

902
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:12,898
Anyone like to dance?

903
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:57,736
Did he have to do that to me?

904
01:49:59,405 --> 01:50:02,616
Bar me from the door of the club...

905
01:50:05,035 --> 01:50:07,204
...with everyone looking.

906
01:50:12,210 --> 01:50:16,714
Whenever I recall that, I can't control myself.

907
01:53:11,521 --> 01:53:12,314
Wake up.

908
01:53:13,023 --> 01:53:16,235
Where's Lilica?

909
01:53:17,027 --> 01:53:18,237
She split.

910
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:34,545
Just as well, she was pissing me off.

911
01:53:37,632 --> 01:53:39,217
Don't talk about her that way.

912
01:53:40,635 --> 01:53:43,847
- She was nice. - Go after her, then.

913
01:53:45,348 --> 01:53:48,852
- You'd make a lovely couple. - She was cool.

914
01:53:49,144 --> 01:53:50,812
You're the son of a bitch!

915
01:53:52,522 --> 01:53:56,443
Look, if you don't like it, just get out!

916
01:53:56,527 --> 01:53:58,612
The fewer we are, the better.

917
01:53:58,737 --> 01:54:01,532
You can't say that This isn't your house!

918
01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:03,534
You're asking for it!

919
01:54:03,742 --> 01:54:07,413
We saw your mother giving her ass to Sapato.

920
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:10,249
You screwy bastard!

921
01:54:10,625 --> 01:54:14,420
- That goddamned whore! - Think I didn't know?!

922
01:54:15,213 --> 01:54:17,715
I told you she'd be first on my list.

923
01:54:21,052 --> 01:54:24,514
So keep your nose out of other people's business!

924
01:54:26,725 --> 01:54:28,226
Did you hear, you asshole?!

925
01:54:56,130 --> 01:54:57,423
What time is it?

926
01:55:09,352 --> 01:55:10,854
Up we go!

927
01:55:15,234 --> 01:55:18,737
Let's go make babies.

928
01:56:05,119 --> 01:56:09,457
Sit there gringo, We'll 
soon finish you off.

929
01:56:11,542 --> 01:56:13,628
Let me kiss you.

930
01:56:18,258 --> 01:56:22,429
Fuckin' gringo, don't push me!

931
01:56:23,930 --> 01:56:25,849
Don't push me.

932
01:56:37,861 --> 01:56:41,657
Let me kiss you there, you scumbag!

933
01:56:54,045 --> 01:56:57,840
Keep still, creep, or you're dead!

934
01:57:01,427 --> 01:57:03,722
Get him, Dito! Get him!

935
01:57:03,847 --> 01:57:05,724
I told you never to say my name!

936
01:57:06,224 --> 01:57:08,351
Stop that! Look out, Dito!

937
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:10,228
Shoot!

938
01:57:55,025 --> 01:57:57,152
I'm leaving, Sueli.

939
01:58:06,454 --> 01:58:08,748
Dito was a nice guy.

940
01:58:09,457 --> 01:58:12,752
I know, don't talk about him anymore.

941
01:58:15,755 --> 01:58:17,131
Dito's dead.

942
01:58:38,237 --> 01:58:40,447
I was falling for Dito.

943
01:58:45,453 --> 01:58:48,539
Lilica was right to fall for him.

944
01:59:06,057 --> 01:59:08,143
All of my family is from Minas.

945
01:59:12,230 --> 01:59:14,733
We could go there.

946
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:21,532
Come with me?

947
01:59:24,243 --> 01:59:26,954
Don't go away.

948
01:59:32,543 --> 01:59:37,548
I can't live all alone.

949
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:13,044
What's wrong?

950
02:00:23,972 --> 02:00:26,266
It's over.

951
02:00:32,564 --> 02:00:35,943
Come with me, will you? What's wrong?

952
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:38,237
Don't be like that.

953
02:00:38,862 --> 02:00:43,450
Calm down. Everything's okay. Sueli's here.

954
02:00:46,537 --> 02:00:48,873
It's over now.

955
02:00:52,335 --> 02:00:53,461
Better now?

956
02:01:39,342 --> 02:01:41,261
Baby, suck it.

957
02:01:48,143 --> 02:01:50,270
Mommy's with you.

958
02:02:19,551 --> 02:02:21,553
Get off me, Pixote!

959
02:02:30,645 --> 02:02:33,273
Get off, Pixote! I don't want this!

960
02:02:38,862 --> 02:02:41,657
Take your dirty mouth off me!

961
02:02:44,076 --> 02:02:47,246
I'm not your mother! Do you hear?!

962
02:02:50,458 --> 02:02:52,543
I don't want a child!

963
02:02:53,544 --> 02:02:56,464
I hate children!

964
02:02:59,676 --> 02:03:03,680
Go live your own life! We'll each get by on our own!

965
02:03:07,976 --> 02:03:09,269
Scram!

966
02:03:34,962 --> 02:03:35,963
Go.
