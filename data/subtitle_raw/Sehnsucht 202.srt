Fancy presentation and no turnover.

-A beauty cream.

101

-To 650! Of course!

-Yes, big boxes.

-Can I assist you?
-Thanks, this way I'm sure it will stick.

118

What a businessman, running around in your
pajamas at noon.

119
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:51,308
As if things would go better
if I'd wear a tuxedo.

120
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:55,976
Always picking on me.

121
00:12:56,183 --> 00:13:00,579
Whom else? You didn't lift a finger once
since we founded the company.

122
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:04,309
Is that so? Who was out for breakfast with
the bailiff last time? Me!

123
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:08,059
-Do you know what you are?
-You're it yourself.

124
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:18,059
-Yuck!
-What's the matter?

125
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,684
-This is soap!
-What are you saying?

126
00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:23,008
A mix-up.

127
00:13:26,476 --> 00:13:29,642
Correct.
You got the bad end of the stick, though.

128
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:40,268
-Did you find a job for me?
-Yes. Someone's looking for a lift boy.

129
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:42,935
I can do that. Take notes.

130
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:48,308

Have you seen

This goes to show that you know nothing
about business. This might save us!

Go for it right now and write to her.
And I'll go for my breakfast.

-What's the matter?

00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:18,076
The advertisement didn't run. You have to
go to Hesse immediately to take care of it.

-I'll do that.
-If you hurry, I can take you there.

-Gra... Granted, of course.

333
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,434
He's the one granting the advances.

334
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:24,726
-Splitter!
-Yes?

335
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:28,476
Take the lady to the office
and show her the rooms.

336
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,267
We'll take care of the advance later on,
of course.

337
00:29:31,517 --> 00:29:34,935
Out of the way. May I?
I'm sure you'll like it here.

338
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:36,994
Did I do well with the phone?

339
00:29:37,018 --> 00:29:38,409
-Splitter!
-Yes?

340
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:40,159
-Come on!
-Oh yes...

341
00:29:40,183 --> 00:29:43,643
Behave yourself.
No ring ring and stuff like that.

342
00:29:45,142 --> 00:29:49,368
Say, moron,
you're promising her 150 schillings?

343
00:29:49,392 --> 00:29:52,034
-What do you call me? A moron?
-Yes I do.

344
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:53,726
-What are you, then?
-Your partner.

345
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:58,244
You almost blew it right no. Super-moron!

346
00:29:58,268 --> 00:30:01,893
-Beautiful rooms.
-Yes, they are.

347
00:30:02,726 --> 00:30:06,518
-I like it very much.
-Glad to hear.

348
00:30:06,642 --> 00:30:10,577
I don't get it. What does she need 150
schillings, being a millionaire's daughter?

349
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:15,101
That's just her quirk. One flies over the
ocean, the other collects Maybugs...

350
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:16,602
So what will she do in December?

351
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:18,559
And this one wants to earn her own money.

352
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:21,226
And so she should! But not our money!

353
00:30:21,435 --> 00:30:23,702
Say, is it always that quiet here?

354
00:30:23,726 --> 00:30:26,601
Yes... yes, how could you think that...

355
00:30:26,726 --> 00:30:33,601
Sometimes... it's slower... sometimes not
that much... sometimes not at all...

356
00:30:34,018 --> 00:30:37,059
But that doesn't mean anything,
it's just because...

357
00:30:37,517 --> 00:30:42,035
...because... today is Friday, the 13th!

358
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:45,351
-Is that so?
-Oh yes, people are superstitious.

359
00:30:45,893 --> 00:30:51,518
On some Fridays I...
almost look forward to Sundays.

360
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:55,225
So how can we get hold of 150 schillings?

361
00:30:56,642 --> 00:31:00,643
Do you know what we've sold
since yesterday? A toothbrush!

362
00:31:02,326 --> 00:31:06,853
In installments.
And you want 150... Ridiculous!

363
00:31:08,893 --> 00:31:10,976
Say, Bobby, come here.

364
00:31:12,185 --> 00:31:15,643
-I've got an idea.
-Unbelievable!

365
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,201
-But don't get mad.
-On the contrary. A rare occasion anyway.

366
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:21,267
So what is it?

367
00:31:21,643 --> 00:31:23,892
I... I want to sell the ring.

368
00:31:24,768 --> 00:31:29,059
This ring? That I gave to you as a present?
You should be ashamed.

369
00:31:29,101 --> 00:31:31,702
My friend, beggars can't be choosers.

370
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:34,077
That's just a phrase.
You can't sell the ring.

371
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,036
And where can we find the money?

372
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,701
I don't care. This ring you can't sell.

373
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:40,418
-I have to.
-No you don't.

374
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:43,850
-I will.
-You won't. I forbid it.

375
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:47,976
-And why?
-Because... it's a forged rock.

376
00:31:48,393 --> 00:31:50,243
To make it short: a solid business.

377
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:52,952
I can see that. So this is the register?

378
00:31:52,976 --> 00:31:55,851
That's the register, but it doesn't work.
Out of order.

379
00:31:55,975 --> 00:31:59,202
But here you have the list, for comparison.

380
00:31:59,226 --> 00:32:03,368
In line one there's Eau de Cologne,
in line two there's lavender...

381
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:05,035
-You there!
-One moment!

382
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:06,453
And in line three there's red...

383
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:09,827
-Oh, hello!
-Where are the bosses?

384
00:32:09,851 --> 00:32:15,576
My bosses? In there. But they can't be
disturbed right now. An important meeting.

385
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,744
-I have to talk to them.
-Think about it, won't you...

386
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:20,059
Not when money is involved.

387
00:32:20,517 --> 00:32:22,868
Be reasonable, you can't barge in like...

388
00:32:22,892 --> 00:32:26,142
-Who was that?
-Him? He's a money man.

389
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:31,102
He wants to force his capital on us.
But we don't need it.

390
00:32:31,643 --> 00:32:35,100
I you won't pay this minute,
I'll tear down the building today.

391
00:32:35,183 --> 00:32:39,034
-That's unpleasant, isn't it Harry?
-I'll say.

392
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:44,975
Then I guess we'll have to... well...

393
00:32:45,684 --> 00:32:51,017
Dear Property manager, can I offer a pawn?

394
00:32:51,377 --> 00:32:57,185
-A pawn?
-Yes, a souvenir, from a true friend.

395
00:32:57,933 --> 00:33:03,535
All right. But if you won't pay tomorrow,
your ring is gone.

396
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:06,076
Well... well, what can we do.

397
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,767
-Bye.
-Go with god.

398
00:33:09,976 --> 00:33:13,017
Don't you pout.
I'll return exactly the same ring to you.

399
00:33:13,393 --> 00:33:14,726
-See you!
-See you!

400
00:33:18,517 --> 00:33:19,517
One moment, please.

401
00:33:19,976 --> 00:33:22,994
A forged ring can be useful, too.

402
00:33:23,018 --> 00:33:24,952
So what's going on?
Are we out on the street.

403
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:27,159
-For now we're fine.
-Thank god.

404
00:33:27,183 --> 00:33:29,286
If only we had money for the advance.

405
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:33,137
-An advance? For me?
-For you? For the girl, of course.

406
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:37,183
-For the millionairess!
-Advance...

407
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:46,059
What's going on, what's going on.
Who do you think you are?

408
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,826
-Paul!
-Magda!

409
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:55,393
-Paul, listen, I got the job!
-How wonderful.

410
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,393
-So what is it you will be doing?
-I'll be a salesgirl.

411
00:33:59,684 --> 00:34:01,951
-I'll be your first customer, then.
-You are?

412
00:34:01,975 --> 00:34:04,684
I need a dozen razor blades for my boss.

413
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,684
Marvelous, I'll get them for you.
Follow me.

414
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:13,767
Here are the razor blades.

415
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:18,726
-But this is a pack of 120!
-Doesn't matter. They're always useful.

416
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,726
-Maybe a cream?
-For my shoes?

417
00:34:21,975 --> 00:34:26,143
No, for your face. Smell this! Nice cream.

418
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:29,852
You won't find anything here.
What's this?

419
00:34:29,978 --> 00:34:33,119
-Nothing, unfortunately.
-I thought so.

420
00:34:33,143 --> 00:34:35,059
160 schillings altogether.

421
00:34:35,518 --> 00:34:38,810
160 schillings! That's something else.

422
00:34:39,187 --> 00:34:42,308
For this kind of money,
I should've bought a new tire.

423
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:44,142
This here is much more important.

424
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:46,226
-One moment!
-What is it?

425
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:51,243
Ms. Wurmser owes 300 schillings
since three months ago.

426
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:54,392
-This is it!
-No it ain't!

427
00:34:54,684 --> 00:34:58,392
I already collected
the 300 schillings myself.

428
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:00,683
-And where are they now?
-Here.

429
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:03,726
-Very nice.
-Isn't it?

430
00:35:04,142 --> 00:35:07,243
-Very nice.
-What's that? How dare you...

431
00:35:07,267 --> 00:35:08,702
There's only one thing left to do.

432
00:35:08,726 --> 00:35:12,435
One of us has to go out and tell her
that we don't pay advances on principle.

433
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,476
Very well. I'm going out and you tell her.

434
00:35:16,142 --> 00:35:17,808
Too bad about Ms. Wurmser.

435
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:22,851
Say, where should I put the money?
The register doesn't work.

436
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:25,477
-Where does this money come from?
-I collected it.

437
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:29,100
-How did you collect it?
-For the merchandise I sold.

438
00:35:29,683 --> 00:35:32,726
-Someone bought something from us?
-Naturally.

439
00:35:32,892 --> 00:35:34,495
It's not all that natural...

440
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:37,702
Mrs., we're very sorry,
your advance can't...

441
00:35:37,726 --> 00:35:41,600
...be held back any longer.
150 schillings, wasn't it?

442
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:44,185
-Yes.
-Of course we'll have to subtract the tax.

443
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,494
-Splitter!
-Yes?

444
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,768
-Hand over the tax table.
-The tax table.

445
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:49,517
-We have to, unfortunately...

446
00:35:50,351 --> 00:35:54,726
So that makes... No! That's the one from
yesterday, it's no longer valid today.

447
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:57,411
Sorry, my mistake.

448
00:35:57,435 --> 00:35:59,100
Not your first one.

449
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:07,368
Tax on income, unemployment, bachelorhood,
crisis, salary, insurance, labor, welfare.

450
00:36:07,392 --> 00:36:10,643
Altogether that makes...
We'll come out just about even in the end.

451
00:36:12,226 --> 00:36:14,309
-You can't do that.
-Why not? She's got millions.

452
00:36:16,437 --> 00:36:21,605
So, 150 schillings, right?
Here you go, tax-free.

453
00:36:21,768 --> 00:36:23,851
Thanks a million. Thanks.

454
00:36:25,605 --> 00:36:29,813
She really took it.
Well, still 10 schillings left.

455
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,725
For my partner... net gain.

456
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,518
A gentleman from head to toe.

457
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:40,686
1,2,3,4,5,6,7 This one is old, but rich.

458
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:45,600
1,2,3,4,5,6,7 king of spades,
jack of spaces, ace of spades.

459
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:49,356
Three black ones... A negro?

460
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:55,914
No, auntie, he isn't a negro. He isn't old,
either. Aside from that, you got it.

461
00:36:55,938 --> 00:36:58,600
If you don't pay, I will cut the light.

462
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:04,726
-You simply can't to that.
-Oh, it's very simple.

463
00:37:09,092 --> 00:37:11,892
The display window needs much more light.

464
00:37:12,776 --> 00:37:16,909
More light? Only recently,
we installed marvelous effect lighting.

465
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:19,643
-You did?
-Effect lighting! Look for yourself.

466
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:29,017
I don't get it. What's going on?

467
00:37:29,362 --> 00:37:34,143
My friend, think it over. There's a
millionairess sitting outside.

468
00:37:34,604 --> 00:37:38,434
-So make her pay!
-She's not supposed to know!

469
00:37:42,021 --> 00:37:45,393
-By the way, how much is the bill?
-80 schillings.

470
00:37:45,643 --> 00:37:50,851
80 schillings. Well, turn on the light for
a moment so that I can have a look.

471
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:52,468
Will do.

472
00:37:52,546 --> 00:37:53,976
-Strange.
-Indeed.

473
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:56,852
Forget it.

474
00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:05,684
Maybe... for now... 5... schillings... OK?

475
00:38:06,475 --> 00:38:09,310
Are you joking? That won't do, no deal.

476
00:38:09,517 --> 00:38:11,786
Just as a down payment, you...

477
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,578
No no no, I can't wait any longer,
I'll cut it again.

478
00:38:14,602 --> 00:38:18,392
And then there was light.
I just moved my hand like this.

479
00:38:22,351 --> 00:38:24,934
That's the end of it. Good night!

480
00:38:25,104 --> 00:38:28,409
What's going on?
Who's horsing around with the light?

481
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:32,019
What do you think? The light has been cut,
because of 80 schillings.

482
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:38,642
80 schillings? I got it right here.
Turn on the light for a minute.

483
00:38:39,185 --> 00:38:42,683
If you insist. One last time.

484
00:38:43,308 --> 00:38:45,393
-Did you see this?
-Yes, I did.

485
00:38:45,852 --> 00:38:49,725
Suddenly it was dark again.
I just did this...

486
00:39:01,851 --> 00:39:05,201
I left my coat upstairs. But do return
tomorrow, then I'll have it down here.

487
00:39:05,225 --> 00:39:08,244
-Are you trying to make a fool of me?
-I swear, I'll have it down here!

488
00:39:08,268 --> 00:39:10,434
I'm cutting it now. And that's that.

489
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:14,267
-Did you see this?
-Of course. I don't understand.

490
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:20,726
Me neither. I got to have a secret power.
Every time I'm doing this...

491
00:39:23,043 --> 00:39:25,600
-Did you see?
-No, I don't see anything.

492
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:31,118
-Closing time!
-So early?

493
00:39:31,142 --> 00:39:34,018
There's a short-circuit,
so we're closing up.

494
00:39:34,183 --> 00:39:36,351
-Got it.
-No, not a short-circuit. It was me!

495
00:39:37,059 --> 00:39:40,659
-If you allow, I'll walk you out.
-Thank you very much. Good evening!

496
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:43,184
-See you.
-See you.

497
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,035
-Boss, it was me!
-What do you mean?

498
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:53,100
-One moment!
-What's with you?

499
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,058
I got it. If you insist.

500
00:39:58,975 --> 00:40:03,102
Not like that. I'm talking about the
short-circuit. That was me!

501
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:07,059
-That was the electricity guy.
-What are you talking about?

502
00:40:08,143 --> 00:40:12,059
The electricity guy switched the
light on and...

503
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,226
For heaven's sake!

504
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:23,725
So that's why. Now I'm beginning to see.

505
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:54,618
-Good evening!
-Good evening!

506
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:58,809
-How nice to meet you! Good evening!
-Good evening!

507
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:04,393
I'm Wiesinger. And you must be the mother.
The similarity is right there.

508
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:10,933
-This is my aunt.
-You're aunt! I... couldn't have known.

509
00:41:11,185 --> 00:41:14,935
Nice of you to join us. This way, please!

510
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:21,456
♫ The sky over Vienna

511

♫ During a spring night

522
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,829
-Can I get you anything to eat?
-No, thanks!

523
00:42:37,853 --> 00:42:42,146
-No, thanks. Get us three Whiskey Soda.
-No, Whiskey I don't like.

524
00:42:42,933 --> 00:42:44,812
-Then bring two.
-Two.

525
00:42:45,144 --> 00:42:49,725
I don't get why a young, pretty girl
like you is out of a job.

526
00:42:49,937 --> 00:42:54,911
Why... no... not at all...
you know, my boss...

527
00:42:54,935 --> 00:42:58,163
Of course, the boss. It's always like this.

528
00:42:58,187 --> 00:43:04,643
As soon as a boss has a pretty worker,
he's starting to work on her himself.

529
00:43:07,725 --> 00:43:11,518
No? All right, something different, then.
Miss, have you been an aunt for long?

530
00:43:11,683 --> 00:43:16,327
-What are you saying?
-I mean, since when you work in the shop?

531
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,748
Yes, yes, a long time.

532
00:43:18,772 --> 00:43:22,020
You know, my aunt is the manager.

533
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:29,702
Oh, that's fine. You can dress nice and
otherwise you only have to...

534
00:43:29,726 --> 00:43:31,058
...be attentive.

535
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,770
And when is your holiday?

536
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,725
Good evening! Mother?

537
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:43,393
-Mother?
-What is it?

538
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:46,229
Oh, there you are. Mother!

539
00:43:47,352 --> 00:43:51,355
-Finally you're here. Where have you been?
-In the office!

540
00:43:51,768 --> 00:43:55,725
I got a job now! Look at this!

541
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:58,993
-A rose for the rose.
-Gee, thanks.

542
00:43:59,017 --> 00:44:01,853
Brand new. And what is this?

543
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:03,142
A Marguerite.

544
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,934
-What would be your given name?
-Helene.

545
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:10,769
Then this won't work out. Thanks.

546
00:44:10,977 --> 00:44:13,769
-I... What do you want?
-Two schillings, please.

547
00:44:14,104 --> 00:44:16,934
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Thanks a lot.

548
00:44:17,941 --> 00:44:20,184
What a wonderful fragrance.

549
00:44:21,144 --> 00:44:23,538
This is something we humans can't emulate.

550
00:44:23,562 --> 00:44:25,998
-Well...
-Believe me, I'm an expert.

551
00:44:26,022 --> 00:44:28,412
-I know every perfume.
-Do you?

552
00:44:28,436 --> 00:44:30,895
-Yes, indeed.
-Well, how about this, for example?

553
00:44:31,809 --> 00:44:34,079
-"Black Narcissus"
-That's correct!

554
00:44:34,103 --> 00:44:35,433
-Am I right?
-Yes, you are.

555
00:44:35,643 --> 00:44:39,600
-And this?
-"Stone-age Lavender"

556
00:44:40,642 --> 00:44:43,869
I am, in a way,
half of a boss of a perfume factory.

557
00:44:43,893 --> 00:44:46,936
-Half of?
-Yes, the other half sits at home.

558
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:51,267
We used to have a third partner. We had the
money and he had the experience.

559
00:44:51,644 --> 00:44:53,684
No he has the money
and we have the experience.

560
00:44:55,517 --> 00:44:57,747
-Telephone for the lady.
-I'll come.

561
00:44:57,771 --> 00:45:00,601
-Aunt, may I take this for you?
-No no, thanks. Please excuse me.

562
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:05,142
A marvelous invention, this telephone.

563
00:45:06,351 --> 00:45:10,144
Or do you feel awkward now that auntie
has left us alone?

564
00:45:16,934 --> 00:45:22,559
Look, the Kahlenberg. Beautiful, that line
drawn across the sky.

565
00:45:22,893 --> 00:45:25,106
Yes, what a line.

566
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:31,394
-And the Ferris wheel over there!
-Adorable!

567
00:45:34,142 --> 00:45:37,354
-And the St. Stephen's Cathedral!
-Just wonderful.

568
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,829
And this flame over there,
is this the Ring (street in Vienna)?

569
00:45:43,853 --> 00:45:45,101
Yes, the ring.

570
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,684
-You're not even looking!
-Believe me, I see everything.

-What is it?

591
00:47:19,146 --> 00:47:23,268
We have to return home right now.
Nina called, John is sick. He's got fever.

Would you be so kind to drive us home

595

-Oh yes, please!
-With my car? Why? I don't...

596
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:40,285
Of course, I'd love to. I don't know

-Fill it up, then!
-I'll fill it up! Fill do!

Check please!

601
00:47:59,434 --> 00:48:02,184
How nice! Been a while!

602
00:48:04,938 --> 00:48:06,101
Very nice.

603
00:48:06,684 --> 00:48:09,145
May I introduce...

604
00:48:09,337 --> 00:48:10,337
Mr. Riesinger.

605
00:48:12,128 --> 00:48:13,128
My cousin.

606
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,726
-She's your cousin?
-Yes, my cousin.

607
00:48:18,184 --> 00:48:19,479
She was my cousin once, too.

608
00:48:21,767 --> 00:48:24,355
-Good evening!
-Likewise!

609
00:48:40,396 --> 00:48:43,560
-Waiter!
-Yes, Sir?

610
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:46,437
Do you see the bald gentleman over there,
next to the blonde lady?

611
00:48:47,184 --> 00:48:49,703
-Yes, I do.
-Hand him this note.

612
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:52,744
In four minutes. Not sooner and not later.
Right on the dot.

613
00:48:52,768 --> 00:48:55,017
-In four minutes.
-Correct.

614
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:58,410
-Do you have a watch with you?
-Yes.

615
00:48:58,434 --> 00:48:59,517
Fine.

616
00:49:03,058 --> 00:49:07,684
Ladies, everything is settled. Now we have
to hurry, otherwise the gas won't hold.

617
00:49:09,851 --> 00:49:11,537
-Bubi, please!
-Don't talk to me!

618
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:15,683
-It was just a joke!
-A joke? How funny!

619
00:49:17,186 --> 00:49:18,562
-And what do you want?
-One moment.

620
00:49:20,443 --> 00:49:25,285
Here you go, my lady.
It's more comfortable in the back.

621
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:26,851
-I'll sit next to you.
-Do that.

622
00:49:27,101 --> 00:49:29,851
57, 58, 59, 60.

623
00:49:30,726 --> 00:49:32,164
-Here you go!
-What does this mean?

624
00:49:32,188 --> 00:49:35,308
The gentleman who just left handed
me this note for you.

625
00:49:35,564 --> 00:49:37,517
-For me?
-Yes, here you go.

626
00:49:40,184 --> 00:49:44,267
"I couldn't resist the temptation to try
out your car."

627
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:47,911
"I'll leave it corner Mary Street and
New Street."

628
00:49:47,935 --> 00:49:51,979
"Thanks very much, and best wishes to our
mutual cousin."

629
00:49:52,767 --> 00:49:54,100
That beats everything!

630
00:50:02,558 --> 00:50:04,892
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

631
00:50:07,517 --> 00:50:12,061
-Well, so early?
-What do you mean, early? It's almost 8.

632
00:50:29,144 --> 00:50:32,827
You need to put
a bit more imagination into all of this.

633
00:50:32,851 --> 00:50:35,851
Imagination!
Can't help it if I haven't got one.

634
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,619
Invisible advertisement
isn't worth anything.

635
00:50:39,643 --> 00:50:40,643
That's what I mean.

636
00:50:42,308 --> 00:50:44,249
Here, in the shop window,
we must make changes.

637
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:47,100
-Something that catches the eye.
-Exactly.

638
00:50:47,643 --> 00:50:52,410
-Do you think I could give it a try?
-Of course, you can do anything you want.

639
00:50:52,434 --> 00:50:53,475
Perfect.

640
00:50:56,393 --> 00:50:58,910
Say, is there anything special
the bosses are interested in?

641
00:50:58,934 --> 00:51:01,559
They are only interested
in being left alone.

642
00:51:08,393 --> 00:51:09,558
Ridiculous.

643
00:51:26,225 --> 00:51:27,660
-Bobby!
-What is it?

644
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:29,226
-Telephone!
-What?

645
00:51:29,684 --> 00:51:33,433
-Telephone!
-Oh, I thought this was the alarm clock.

646
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,850
Hello, what...

647
00:51:40,142 --> 00:51:42,851
That's ridiculous.
In the middle of the night!

648
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:44,933
Hello.

649
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,827
-Who was it?
-The super.

650
00:51:54,684 --> 00:51:56,601
He's persistent, isn't he?

651
00:51:59,976 --> 00:52:04,018
-Talk to him already.
-No, I just did. Now it's your turn.

652
00:52:04,536 --> 00:52:05,564
If you insist.

653
00:52:07,643 --> 00:52:13,352
Hello? This isn't possible!

654
00:52:14,563 --> 00:52:20,642
We're talking about an heirloom...
Well, can't help it, then.

655
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:26,475
-So what is it?
-Your precious ring, of course.

656
00:52:26,642 --> 00:52:30,892
Oh, he already found out. And now?

657
00:52:31,229 --> 00:52:32,725
Eviction.

658
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,645
-Really?
-Yes!

659
00:52:35,768 --> 00:52:36,768
What can we do?

660
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:48,851
-The bottles, please.
-Here you go.

661
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,434
-Beautiful.
-Isn't it?

662
00:52:54,812 --> 00:52:57,308
-And the fan.
-Fan?

663
00:52:59,392 --> 00:53:01,518
Why do you need a fan?

664
00:53:01,603 --> 00:53:04,268
-For the burning question.
-Why?

665
00:53:07,353 --> 00:53:11,142
Oh, now I get it.
You really are very skillful.

666
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:15,160
My friend, there's only one hope left.
You have to borrow from the millionairess.

667
00:53:15,184 --> 00:53:18,394
-Me? Not a chance.
-Why did we hire her?

668
00:53:18,976 --> 00:53:21,034
Why do I have to do everything
all the time?

669
00:53:21,058 --> 00:53:23,869
Because you are more handsome. Yes, you
look like a film star.

670
00:53:23,893 --> 00:53:30,143
Your charm, your sex appeal, the blank
expression of your eyes, so...

671
00:53:31,302 --> 00:53:35,876
Harry, be reasonable. It's a dire
situation. Get dressed, will you!

672
00:53:38,517 --> 00:53:40,309
-Finished?
-Yes, in a moment.

673
00:53:42,934 --> 00:53:46,001
-Please turn on the fan now.
-The fan, will do.

674
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:52,558
-Thank you.
-The ribbon isn't in place. To the right!

675
00:53:53,143 --> 00:53:55,184
To the left, from your point of view.

676
00:53:58,608 --> 00:54:03,517
-Thank you. Now bring me a nail, please.
-A nail? A big one or a small one?

677
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:08,309
-Done! Now what do you think?
-Marvelous!

678
00:54:15,476 --> 00:54:17,351
BLIND

679
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:28,351
Look at this! I'll have a closer look.

680
00:54:29,893 --> 00:54:31,643
DEAF

681
00:54:33,392 --> 00:54:36,767
-How original!
-Excellent advertisement!

682
00:54:40,685 --> 00:54:42,576
-Is this fine?
-Beautiful, indeed.

683
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,434
-Now, please help me down.
-Just take my hand.

684
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:57,767
PLEASE COME IN. WE CAN'T PRESENT
EVERYTHING IN THE SHOP WINDOW.

685
00:54:58,426 --> 00:55:02,985
Look at this!
A tiny bit of packaging goes a long way.

686
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:04,009
Marvelous.

687
00:55:05,058 --> 00:55:08,062
Excuse me, please let me through.

688
00:55:09,392 --> 00:55:10,768
One moment, please.

689
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:13,810
-Good morning, Sir.
-Good morning, Miss.

690
00:55:15,017 --> 00:55:17,831
-I came in.
-How nice of you.

691
00:55:17,855 --> 00:55:22,352
-What can I show you?
-What I couldn't see in the window.

692
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:23,392
One moment.

693
00:55:24,101 --> 00:55:26,743
Good morning, Sir. What can I show you?

694
00:55:26,767 --> 00:55:28,975
You? Nothing!
The young lady on the other hand...

695
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,123
-Hello, Miss.
-Hello, Sir.

696
00:55:31,147 --> 00:55:36,559
I came in... I'd like to, I saw in the...

697
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:48,188
Please, gentlemen! Not all at once!

698
00:55:49,268 --> 00:55:51,705
-Good morning!
-What do these people want?

699
00:55:51,729 --> 00:55:54,184
-Tell them we pay on Sunday.
-But those are customers!

700
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,725
-Customers?
-Of course.

701
00:56:00,109 --> 00:56:02,702
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

702
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:04,329
-These really are customers?
-Of course.

703
00:56:04,353 --> 00:56:08,119
-Where do they come from?
-The new girl rearranged the shop window.

704
00:56:08,143 --> 00:56:09,851
What a pleasant thing to hear.

705
00:56:09,976 --> 00:56:11,660
Four bottles of eau de cologne, please.

706
00:56:11,684 --> 00:56:14,410
-Four bottles eau de cologne.
-That's the phone bill, right there.

707
00:56:14,434 --> 00:56:17,286
-Five bottles lavender.
-And there's the light bill.

708
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:21,159
Marvelous. Tell her to see us in the office
for a moment.

709
00:56:21,183 --> 00:56:23,785
-She's with a customer right now.
-Then you will cover for her.

710
00:56:23,809 --> 00:56:26,933
-I don't know. That one guy didn't like me.
-I can relate.

711
00:56:31,311 --> 00:56:35,577
One moment, one moment.
We'll make sure to deliver all of this.

712
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,911
-In person?
-You can bet on that.

713
00:56:37,935 --> 00:56:40,468
-See you later, then.
-See you later.

714
00:56:41,058 --> 00:56:44,910
One moment, now it's my turn.
Miss, out there, in the show window...

715
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:47,034
Sorry, the bosses want you in the office.

716
00:56:47,058 --> 00:56:48,892
-But I'm with customers!
-I'll cover for you.

717
00:56:49,059 --> 00:56:51,409
-One moment, please.
-Miss, please stay!

718
00:56:51,433 --> 00:56:54,933
-Sir how can I help you?
-You can't, I already told you that.

719
00:56:55,184 --> 00:56:56,767
Disgusting evasiveness. Goodbye.

720
00:56:57,393 --> 00:56:59,900
-See you.
-I knew he doesn't like me.

721
00:57:00,143 --> 00:57:01,809
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

722
00:57:02,021 --> 00:57:06,894
-You want to talk to me?
-My partner needs to tell you something.

723
00:57:08,101 --> 00:57:11,035
-Correct?
-Yes, correct, I...

724
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:15,434
...he's a bit shy. I hope you understand.

725
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:20,188
Won't you take a seat?

726
00:57:22,975 --> 00:57:29,687
-It's just...
-Now he can talk more freely. Am I right?

727
00:57:32,767 --> 00:57:33,767
Well?

728
00:57:34,018 --> 00:57:41,726
Well... I... I'm supposed to...

729
00:57:42,314 --> 00:57:44,726
-I'd like to ask you something.
-Go on!

730
00:57:45,226 --> 00:57:48,894
I wanted to tell you something
that is very close to my heart.

731
00:57:51,687 --> 00:57:54,100
-But we just met.
-Yes.

732
00:57:54,601 --> 00:57:57,327
-Two days ago.
-I said that, too.

733
00:57:57,351 --> 00:58:00,577
My partner talked me into it, though.

734
00:58:00,601 --> 00:58:06,100
-Talked you into it?
-Yes, because I was afraid to tell you.

735
00:58:06,308 --> 00:58:08,559
To be honest, I'm afraid even now.

736
00:58:10,393 --> 00:58:15,494
I think I already know.

737
00:58:15,518 --> 00:58:20,684
Really? Thank heavens, that's a relief.

738
00:58:22,017 --> 00:58:29,076
-So... can I hope?
-I have to talk to my mother, first.

739
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:33,683
Do that! When can I expect an answer?

740
00:58:34,267 --> 00:58:38,673
-Is it that urgent?
-Yes, very urgent.

741
00:58:40,525 --> 00:58:43,456
Maybe I'll see you tonight? I'll call you.

742
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,934
-Deal?
-Deal!

743
00:58:45,893 --> 00:58:48,767
-You really are charming. Thanks a lot!
-You're welcome.

744
00:58:48,893 --> 00:58:53,267
Miss, if you allow, might I ask

745
00:58:54,226 --> 00:58:57,062
for an advance right now?

746
00:59:05,893 --> 00:59:10,309
Splitter, Splitter... I'm so happy!

747
00:59:15,101 --> 00:59:19,892
-What's that?
-Me... I...

748
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:26,226
What's going on? Did you talk to her?

749
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:29,059
-Yes.
-And did she give you something?

750
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,518
-Yes, a kiss.
-What are you saying?

751
00:59:33,433 --> 00:59:37,184
You know, I think I proposed to her.

752
00:59:38,142 --> 00:59:43,142
-You were supposed to ask for a loan.
-I did. But she misunderstood.

753
00:59:43,561 --> 00:59:47,768
-And now?
-And now we go on a date.

754
00:59:47,934 --> 00:59:52,226
How nice. You'll tell her then.
And no misunderstandings this time.

755
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:53,963
-Nothing doing?
-Sorry?

756
00:59:53,987 --> 00:59:58,201
-Now that I know that she loves me I can't.
-Is that so? I'll tell her, then.

757
00:59:58,225 --> 01:00:02,453
-Hey, hey, I forbid it!
-I'll do it anyway.

758
01:00:02,851 --> 01:00:06,577
-I'll make sure you don't.
-No chance. Want to take a bet?

759
01:00:06,601 --> 01:00:09,851
-We'll see.
-We'll see, exactly. We'll...

760
01:00:10,392 --> 01:00:11,976
-Kitty!
-Bobby!

761
01:00:12,517 --> 01:00:14,517
What brings you here?

762
01:00:15,522 --> 01:00:18,518
I want to get to know you in your
field of action.

763
01:00:18,684 --> 01:00:24,101
That's sweet of... Splitter, please
go and find out what time it is.

764
01:00:26,101 --> 01:00:29,559
-It's nice here.
-It is? Do you like it?

765
01:00:29,683 --> 01:00:33,143
Yes, indeed. So, what do you have on offer?

766
01:00:33,517 --> 01:00:39,104
My lady, let's see. Our own make,
available in all sizes and prize levels.

767
01:00:39,143 --> 01:00:40,851
Oh, how beautiful.

768
01:00:42,894 --> 01:00:44,767
COURT OF EXECUTION, VIENNA

769
01:00:48,435 --> 01:00:52,726
-This must be your trademark.
-Yes, our trademark.

770
01:00:54,733 --> 01:00:57,897
What kind of funny animal is this?

771
01:00:58,058 --> 01:01:00,451
-That's a vulture.
-A vulture?

772
01:01:00,475 --> 01:01:03,772
Yes, there's one of them on all of our
bottles. How many do you want?

773
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:11,308
Not a single one. I came by to tell you I'm
free tonight and want to go out with you.

774
01:01:11,892 --> 01:01:14,077
-Tonight won't do.
-Why not?

775
01:01:14,101 --> 01:01:19,953
Tonight I'll have to take inventory.
I'll be busy all night.

776
01:01:20,517 --> 01:01:28,392
I'm sorry about that, poor you.
I'll have to think of you all night, then.

777
01:01:30,475 --> 01:01:33,286
-Kitty, you must change perfumes.
-Why?

778
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:35,328
That one's dangerous for me.

779
01:01:35,352 --> 01:01:41,393
♫ My dearest I'm in love with your perfume

780
01:01:42,142 --> 01:01:47,308
♫ Because it puts me in the right mood

781
01:01:47,935 --> 01:01:53,396
♫ I don't know what it is,
I only realize

782
01:01:53,767 --> 01:01:58,560
♫ There's something, there's something,
there's something

783
01:01:59,018 --> 01:02:04,312
♫ My dearest, I'm so fond of your perfume

784
01:02:05,184 --> 01:02:10,351
♫ It brings us together,
even when you're far away

785
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:16,850
♫ It smells of kisses that only happen once

786
01:02:21,602 --> 01:02:25,977
♫ I'm in love with your perfume

787
01:02:38,434 --> 01:02:42,747
I don't like you going out
with your boss at night.

788
01:02:42,771 --> 01:02:48,960
But mother, if you only knew him.
He's so harmless.

789
01:02:48,984 --> 01:02:50,892
Those are the worst, believe me, I know.

790
01:02:56,144 --> 01:03:01,410
I can't go like this, anyway. My god,
nothing to wear.

791
01:03:01,434 --> 01:03:03,868
What do you mean?
Your blue dress is very nice.

792
01:03:03,892 --> 01:03:06,744
-No, I can't wear that.
-Why?

793
01:03:06,768 --> 01:03:08,494
It's way too short.

794
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:12,517
Oh, I forgot. These days,
long dresses are in style again.

795
01:03:14,143 --> 01:03:18,183
Wait a minute! I got an idea!

796
01:03:24,726 --> 01:03:26,226
Well, what about this one?

797
01:03:26,726 --> 01:03:28,744
-Isn't this grandma's ball dress?
-Yes, it is.

798
01:03:28,768 --> 01:03:31,476
-And I'm supposed to wear it?
-It's all the rage now!

799
01:03:32,272 --> 01:03:36,142
-But mother, that won't work.
-Wait and see!

800
01:04:15,684 --> 01:04:18,451
Say Harry, where are you going to meet her?

801
01:04:18,475 --> 01:04:20,017
So we won't end up at the same place.

802
01:04:20,269 --> 01:04:25,267
-We're going to the Moulin Rouge.
-The Moulin Rouge, interesting. Have fun.

803
01:04:26,142 --> 01:04:29,518
-One moment, did you hear that?
-What are you saying?

804
01:04:30,268 --> 01:04:32,768
-Didn't you hear it?
-You and your jokes.

805
01:04:33,309 --> 01:04:36,085
-There's something going on in there.
-Then take a look!

806
01:04:36,109 --> 01:04:38,933
-I'm afraid.
-What a hero.

807
01:04:39,142 --> 01:04:42,559
You go. You're the stronger one.

808
01:04:46,433 --> 01:04:48,017
So, who did win the bet?

809
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:54,350
I was never smarter. And now I'm going to
get money from the millionairess.

810
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:57,268
Do not get bored in the meantime.

811
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,103
Open up, scoundrel!

812
01:05:09,142 --> 01:05:11,354
Don't forget to bring out the shoes.

813
01:05:16,475 --> 01:05:22,812
-Well, isn't this lovely?
-Yes, very modern.

814
01:05:23,058 --> 01:05:26,517
And at the same time,
just like in the olden days.

815
01:07:35,229 --> 01:07:38,476
That dress!
I've rarely seen anything so sweet.

816
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:43,850
-Do you really like it?
-All I can say is: cheers!

817
01:07:45,642 --> 01:07:46,642
Waiter!

818
01:07:47,175 --> 01:07:50,368
-Won't you tell me already about...
-...the waiter? He'll be here in a moment.

819
01:07:50,392 --> 01:07:52,786
-No, I...
-Yes, he will. Just a little...

820
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:54,767
I'm talking about your partner!

821
01:07:55,216 --> 01:08:01,119
Oh, you're talking about Harry. Well, as
I told you, he is indisposed,

822
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,952
and he asked me to fill in for him,
as far as...

823
01:08:03,976 --> 01:08:06,660
Are you saying he won't show up at all?

824
01:08:06,684 --> 01:08:09,852
He will!
As soon as he manages to free himself up.

825
01:08:19,601 --> 01:08:22,643
Are you that unhappy about the substitute?

826
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:27,142
-You aren't? Well then, cheers!
-Cheers!

827
01:08:29,568 --> 01:08:33,475
-My friend Harry talked to you today.
-Yes, he did.

828
01:08:33,808 --> 01:08:37,308
-And while doing so, he...
-Yes, he did.

829
01:08:37,683 --> 01:08:41,202
-No he didn't, that's the thing. It was...
-I'm sorry.

830
01:08:41,226 --> 01:08:42,850
-What's that?
-May I?

831
01:08:44,018 --> 01:08:46,933
-Please excuse me.
-Well, that...

832
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:52,577
-One moment, how much are these liqueurs?
-4 schillings.

833
01:08:52,601 --> 01:08:54,268
-Both of them?
-8 schillings.

834
01:08:54,934 --> 01:08:57,603
Then bring me... one more.

835
01:09:18,518 --> 01:09:23,934
♫ My dearest I'm in love with your perfume

836
01:09:24,683 --> 01:09:28,976
♫ Because it puts me in the right mood

837
01:09:29,809 --> 01:09:33,576
Auntie, I don't get it.
Why shouldn't I call him?

838
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:39,850
-Because it is not proper.
-Why not? The poor guy's taking inventory.

839
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:45,226
♫ My dearest, I'm so fond of your perfume

840
01:09:46,018 --> 01:09:50,184
♫ It brings us together,
even when you're far away

841
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,392
♫ It smells of kisses that...

842
01:09:55,475 --> 01:09:58,143
-I am going to call him!
-Kitty!

843
01:09:58,726 --> 01:09:59,808
Yes, I'm calling him.

844
01:10:18,933 --> 01:10:23,225
-Hello! Help!
-What? What happened?

845
01:10:23,311 --> 01:10:28,770
-Help! The rascal locked me in!
-I'll call the police immediately!

846
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:33,850
♫ My dearest I'm in love with your perfume

847
01:10:34,393 --> 01:10:38,600
♫ Because it puts me in the right mood

848
01:10:38,725 --> 01:10:42,683
♫ I don't know what it is,
I only realize

849
01:10:43,018 --> 01:10:47,185
♫ There's something, there's something,
there's something

850
01:10:49,101 --> 01:10:54,392
You left me here... Terrible, that noise!

851
01:10:54,601 --> 01:10:57,852
-By the way, we were interrupted.
-Yes, we were.

852
01:10:58,143 --> 01:11:03,785
-What is it you wanted to say?
-I... Impossible with this music.

853
01:11:03,809 --> 01:11:07,809
It's about... Thank heavens!

854
01:11:08,228 --> 01:11:10,018
It's about making a dream come...

855
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,142
Here we go again.

856
01:11:13,893 --> 01:11:15,892
It's about making a dream come true.

857
01:11:17,311 --> 01:11:21,159
-May I have this dance?
-I don't know.

858
01:11:21,183 --> 01:11:25,768
I beg you. You can't deny me this waltz.
Ain't I right, Sir?

859
01:11:28,018 --> 01:11:29,439
-Please excuse me.
-Thank you.

860
01:11:47,226 --> 01:11:50,701
-I'm sorry... Hey there, you!
-What do you want?

861
01:11:50,725 --> 01:11:55,017
-All this dance music all the time!
-Of course, this is a dance bar.

862
01:11:55,772 --> 01:11:59,392
-The orchestra plays whatever one wants?
-Yes, why not?

863
01:11:59,726 --> 01:12:02,398
Then tell them to play rummy for a while.

864
01:12:13,101 --> 01:12:14,897
Hello! Is anybody here?

865
01:12:16,018 --> 01:12:19,059
Look over there. Someone's knocking.

866
01:12:19,434 --> 01:12:20,975
Turn on the light!

867
01:12:27,518 --> 01:12:29,577
-Hands in the air!
-I beg your pardon?

868
01:12:29,601 --> 01:12:31,539
-Hands in the air!
-But I'm the owner!

869
01:12:31,563 --> 01:12:33,767
-Anyone could say that.
-Good evening.

870
01:12:34,018 --> 01:12:39,481
Good evening. My good friend,
am I the owner or ain't I?

871
01:12:39,767 --> 01:12:41,309
-Does he tell the truth?
-Of course.

872
01:12:41,851 --> 01:12:45,392
-Why didn't you say so earlier?
-Earlier? I couldn't get a word in!

873
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:48,836
And what are you doing in there?
Who locked you in?

874
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:51,310
My partner played a stupid joke on me.

875
01:12:51,642 --> 01:12:54,536
Unbelievable! Calling the cops for that?

876
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,725
I could've died of hunger in there.
Maybe that's what you...

877
01:12:58,058 --> 01:12:59,729
-Where's Bobby?
-And who are you?

878
01:13:00,017 --> 01:13:03,494
-I called here just now.
-So you were the one setting me free!

879
01:13:03,518 --> 01:13:06,518
So where is Bobby? What did you do to him?

880
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,410
I to him? He to me! He locked me in!

881
01:13:10,434 --> 01:13:13,744
Unbelievable. Let me tell you something.

882
01:13:13,768 --> 01:13:17,826
I'll report you for
deceiving the authorities. On with it!

883
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:23,451
-Now you see what my partner is up to.
-Your partner? He's your partner?

884
01:13:23,475 --> 01:13:26,536
-Of course!
-He told me he'd be working here all night.

885
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:30,309
Working my ass. He's at the Moulin Rouge,
with my girl.

886
01:13:30,725 --> 01:13:36,142
Enough dancing already. Now we need to
have a talk before the music starts again.

887
01:13:36,851 --> 01:13:42,809
-I... My friend thinks, in our business...
-May I?

888
01:13:45,184 --> 01:13:47,309
Excuse me, may I?

889
01:13:51,976 --> 01:13:57,143
Finally, he's left. So, my friend thinks,
we need a woman in our business.

890
01:13:57,601 --> 01:14:00,535
-Do you want to be a boss at our firm?
-Me?

891
01:14:00,559 --> 01:14:08,142
He told you lots of silly stuff, probably.
But the gist of it, the transaction...

892
01:14:08,684 --> 01:14:13,642
-...he doesn't know anything about that.
-But I'm no transaction.

893
01:14:14,184 --> 01:14:17,327
Well, to me, a few 100.000s schillings
feels like business.

894
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:19,392
It's not a lot, but we'll take it.

895
01:14:20,268 --> 01:14:22,243
What are you talking about?

896
01:14:22,267 --> 01:14:28,726
I'm talking about the money you might...
would invest in our business. Charmingly...

897
01:14:28,975 --> 01:14:31,726
Me? But I don't have any money.

898
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:38,142
That's something else.
A millionairess and no money?

899
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:42,809
Millionairess? But I'm no millionairess!

900
01:14:43,601 --> 01:14:48,601
-But you advertised!
-Not that I'm a millionairess!

901
01:14:49,226 --> 01:14:54,284
Don't fool around! Are you Longing 202
or aren't you Longing 202?

902
01:14:54,308 --> 01:14:58,725
-Of course I'm Longing 202!
-I knew it. Here, read this.

903
01:14:59,101 --> 01:15:01,517
"Lady worth millions..."

904
01:15:01,851 --> 01:15:06,685
-Unbelievable! That's a terrible mistake!
-What do you mean?

905
01:15:07,892 --> 01:15:15,102
-I never advertised this!
-Oh my... You don't have any money?

906
01:15:15,225 --> 01:15:18,243
-No!
-Mrs., you are a swindler!

907
01:15:18,267 --> 01:15:21,435
-How dare you!
-Stay on your seat, don't make a scene!

908
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:28,558
Now I get it. That's why you hired me.

909
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:33,779
And that's why you were so nice to me!
And that's why your friend asked me out!

910
01:15:34,058 --> 01:15:37,851
-What a nerve!
-She must be jealous.

911
01:15:44,309 --> 01:15:46,684
-Shame on you!
-What's going on?

912
01:15:47,183 --> 01:15:49,643
-Leave me be!
-Magda!

913
01:15:51,310 --> 01:15:56,035
Here he is, the scoundrel! Making a date
with me and going out with another girl.

914
01:15:56,059 --> 01:15:58,808
-Why are you here, Kitty?
-Why am I here? For this!

915
01:16:02,517 --> 01:16:03,850

01:16:19,768 --> 01:16:22,284
-You've got me into trouble again.
-Me?

919
01:16:22,308 --> 01:16:27,202
-We'll talk about it at home. Just wait.
-Forget it, we're no longer friends.

920
01:16:27,226 --> 01:16:30,934
-From now on you mean nothing to me.
-That's right.

921
01:16:30,976 --> 01:16:37,684
You're mean less than nothing to me.
Vacuum, negative space, black hole.
