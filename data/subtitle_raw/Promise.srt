2
00:00:44,054 --> 00:00:45,923
We all agree that this
gold stays in the ground

3
00:00:45,956 --> 00:00:48,658
until I get word that
it's time to go to Mexico.

4
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:50,559
What about the folks
who live here, Zeb?

5
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,461
The owner of this
manure pit was killed

6
00:00:52,495 --> 00:00:54,563
in General Sibley's
actions last year.

7
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:56,465
No one will be back
here for any reason.

8
00:00:56,499 --> 00:00:59,202
This place gives me
the heebie jeebies.

9
00:00:59,236 --> 00:01:02,105
We bury it, we split
up until I give the word

10
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:07,077
and we all three come back
here together, agreed?

11
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,611
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

12
00:03:19,142 --> 00:03:20,977
My regiment leaves
in the morning.

13
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:48,038
Words cannot
express my gratitude

14
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:50,273
for what you have done
for my little family.

15
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:00,250
This year was so hard on us.

16
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:02,718
Without you, we may
never have survived

17
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:04,354
as this conflict raged.

18
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,694
Thanks to you, we may
return to St. Louis

19
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:15,899
and my little one has a
chance at a real education,

20
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:19,869
and this nightmare
will be left behind us.

21
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:26,742
I love you, the both of you,
and I will come back for you.

22
00:04:32,048 --> 00:04:33,782
When you come for us,

23
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:36,052
you swear you'll
never leave us again?

24
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:37,320
With all my heart.

25
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:40,190
I believe you.

26
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:43,894
We deserve a place of peace.

27
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:44,793
For all time.

28
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:56,339
I know you cherish this.

29
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:01,111
Spencer, you're
leaving us again.

30
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:04,414
You've changed our lives.

31
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:11,087
I can only repay you with
my eternal and undying love.

32
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:14,723
That is all I wish.

33
00:06:19,956 --> 00:06:23,126
Zeb, if there ain't nobody
living on this spread,

34
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,228
why do I see people
moving in the house?

35
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:27,397
There's a woman's face
there in the window.

36
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,866
Oh hell, you two
stay here with the gold.

37
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,235
I'm gonna have me a looksie.

38
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:44,381
Promise, run, run!

39
00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:48,218
Oh hell, lady, you
gotta be kidding!

40
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:51,288
Ouch, oh, Jesus Christ!

41
00:06:53,423 --> 00:06:56,026
Run, Promise, run!

42
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:09,472
Well, look what we have here.

43
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:11,441
You ignate wretch.

44
00:07:13,276 --> 00:07:15,011
This isn't a pleasure palace.

45
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:16,179
Well, what about her?

46
00:07:29,526 --> 00:07:32,262
Let's just leave the little
darling to her memories.

47
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:49,546
I thought I told you jacking
ape to stay with the gold.

48
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:53,083
Zeb, my legs are hurting,
I need to go see a saw bone.

49
00:07:53,116 --> 00:07:55,585
You shut your mouth,
I was shot four times

50
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:57,487
in Lawrence, Kansas, and
didn't complain about it

51
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,090
half as much as
that little scratch.

52
00:08:00,123 --> 00:08:01,358
You tie that off,

53
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:03,660
and let's get the
hell out of here.

54
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:56,513
You sure do take your
time with them damn cards.

55
00:08:56,546 --> 00:08:59,048
I picked up the habit
of exercising caution,

56
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:01,317
almost a lifetime ago.

57
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:07,190
Yeah? Well, to hell with
your caution, I'm down $50.

58
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:10,560
Don't play if you
can't afford it.

59
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:17,000
Saloon-keeper.

60
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:20,203
What will it be?

61
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:21,704
Well, it's after
nine in the morning,

62
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:24,174
I believe I'll have a tequila.

63
00:09:24,207 --> 00:09:26,543
Oh, and my friend
here looks hungry,

64
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,947
bring him the house
special, and maybe a beer.

65
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:37,220
Right, kind of you.

66
00:09:40,356 --> 00:09:42,258
What did you pitch
your name as again?

67
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:44,961
I didn't.

68
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:21,664
Oh, Christ, I needed that.

69
00:10:21,698 --> 00:10:26,102
I've been riding since
Yuma, no time for a meal.

70
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:34,544
I know, you'd be one Zebediah
Scurlock, from Missouri.

71
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:44,487
There's a territorial warrant
out of Yuma for your arrest.

72
00:10:47,257 --> 00:10:52,161
The warrant stipulates choice
of delivery to authorities.

73
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:56,432
And the choices are?

74
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,135
Alive or dead.

75
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:01,804
You got some nerve, shit heel.

76
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:04,741
I'm giving you a choice,
you can make this easy,

77
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:06,809
or you can make this hard.

78
00:11:06,843 --> 00:11:08,278
Why the hell would
I surrender to you?

79
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:10,547
Well, I just bought
your sustenance.

80
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:13,683
Fiddly, I don't care
much for your deal,

81
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:15,385
you son of a bitch.

82
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:17,420
You know who the hell you're
fucking with, jack ass?

83
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:18,688
I do.

84
00:11:32,302 --> 00:11:34,270
You shouldn't have done that.

85
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:47,483
You witness that?

86
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:51,120
I don't get it, you knew
you were gonna kill him,

87
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:53,122
why did you buy him a meal?

88
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:54,624
I didn't want the son
of a bitch to go to hell

89
00:11:54,657 --> 00:11:55,725
on an empty stomach.

90
00:12:07,303 --> 00:12:10,340
Sheriff, are these all the
bills for the past six months?

91
00:12:10,373 --> 00:12:11,374
Every one of them.

92
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:15,578
You looking for
anyone in particular?

93
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:16,479
Indeed, I am.

94
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:21,751
It seems to me
a little peculiar,

95
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:26,789
a young lady perusing handbills.

96
00:12:26,823 --> 00:12:29,359
I'm not what you'd
expect, Sheriff. Thank you.

97
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:31,361
Okay.

98
00:12:48,211 --> 00:12:49,445
I don't understand it.

99
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,282
Of course, he aint
been in the right mind

100
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:56,753
since the surrender
12... No, 13 years ago.

101
00:12:57,754 --> 00:12:59,389
What the hell are you
talking about, Wild Eye?

102
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:00,456
My brother, Zebediah.

103
00:13:05,896 --> 00:13:08,731
I was in Tucumcari last night,

104
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:13,403
I read in the Tribune
Express that he got himself

105
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:17,240
all shot to hell by a
bushwhacking shootist.

106
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,778
Poor son of a bitch got
slung over his own saddle.

107
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:26,849
Man, all down to Yuma
for a territorial reward.

108
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,755
A goddamn shame.

109
00:13:33,556 --> 00:13:34,857
Yeah, a goddamn shame.

110
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:42,465
You know, he rode
the Cowan trail.

111
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,235
Who's Cowan trail, Wild Eye?

112
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:50,339
Brick, your brains are like
a gelding's balls, missing.

113
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:52,475
Forget it.

114
00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:58,347
You know lots of folks
thought him shameful,

115
00:13:58,381 --> 00:13:59,849
for riding with
all those vermin.

116
00:14:00,918 --> 00:14:02,585
Hmm, but they suited him.

117
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,590
And after all the
scrapes he been through,

118
00:14:07,623 --> 00:14:10,326
all that killing, all
the women and children

119
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:13,629
they sent to their maker
and he never got a scratch

120
00:14:14,932 --> 00:14:19,635
and now he comes to
an end like this.

121
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:24,874
You know, I served my
time in the regiments,

122
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:31,280
and look at me, goddamn
battle of Chickamauga,

123
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:37,687
goddamn Johnny Reb, took my eye,

124
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:40,389
and gave me this throw, nothing!

125
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:48,397
Nothing,

126
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:50,666
is ever even in this world.

127
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:55,906
Well, I guess that's just
the way the Lord intended,

128
00:14:55,939 --> 00:14:56,806
I reckon.

129
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:03,846
Well, I intend to even
things out to a fair degree.

130
00:15:09,752 --> 00:15:10,620
How so?

131
00:15:11,955 --> 00:15:14,057
When I was reading
the Tribune Express,

132
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:18,795
it said personal
effects may be collected

133
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:22,832
by the next of kin at the
Grissom Brothers Undertakers.

134
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:26,335
So I paid that
establishment a visit,

135
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:30,406
you know what I found?

136
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:35,078
He's Cold Navy and hide
away smith, $2.43, and this.

137
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,587
Seems that mother Scurlock's
dearest oldest golden boy

138
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,891
kept himself a personal
record of his exploits in 61.

139
00:15:49,425 --> 00:15:51,427
Now that opportunistic
son of a bitch,

140
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,429
he probably thought he
could sell all these

141
00:15:53,462 --> 00:15:54,463
to the penny dreadfuls.

142
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:57,366
Whatever,

143
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,335
most of it is a load of shit.

144
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:05,943
But one story intrigued me,
about a certain cash box.

145
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:15,118
Dear, stupid, older brother,

146
00:16:15,152 --> 00:16:18,454
you just may have made
one thing successful

147
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:20,489
out of your wretched life.

148
00:16:21,992 --> 00:16:25,828
Brick, forget about them two
smithy jobs down in El Paso,

149
00:16:26,997 --> 00:16:31,034
how would you like to
make some real money.

150
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:56,826
I've missed you,
something terrible.

151
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:01,797
How long's your stay
gonna be this time?

152
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:04,500
I hadn't really
thought about it,

153
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:09,039
I'm too busy enjoying
the scenery right now.

154
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:12,675
Oh, come on, bastard,
you can't fool me.

155
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,177
You always know your next move.

156
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:17,981
You know me too well.

157
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:21,651
If I were you,
I'd never leave me.

158
00:17:21,684 --> 00:17:24,154
And I never argue
with logic, Francesca.

159
00:17:24,187 --> 00:17:25,855
Then how come you do leave?

160
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:30,559
And how come you ask
so many fool questions?

161
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:42,605
Hmm, goddamn Ransom, honey.

162
00:17:51,982 --> 00:17:56,086
There's two compelling
reasons why you should stay.

163
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:58,688
You know in your heart

164
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:01,058
that you bring to me
all the joy in my life.

165
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:05,429
It does a woman good
to hear things like that.

166
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:13,003
Tell me, what is that
void in your soul?

167
00:18:13,937 --> 00:18:14,905
What do you mean?

168
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:19,910
We've been together,
a good long time now,

169
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:22,879
when you're here.

170
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:30,619
And I know all of you, your
strength, your loyalty,

171
00:18:34,124 --> 00:18:35,158
your passions.

172
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:40,629
And I know about that
canyon in your soul,

173
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:43,166
that place no one can enter.

174
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:48,071
Don't make with
fancy words, Francesca.

175
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:51,008
There is a sadness
inside of you

176
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,641
and you won't even admit it.

177
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:56,679
You certainly
weren't confronted.

178
00:18:57,847 --> 00:18:59,082
You're wrong about that.

179
00:19:01,218 --> 00:19:06,223
I confront it every day, some
days I wish I didn't have to.

180
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:08,591
Well, lover, tell me.

181
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:16,599
What do you know about loss?

182
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:18,235
A little bit.

183
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:24,941
I miss my daddy,
now and again.

184
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:30,280
There was someone in my past,

185
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,085
when I should have
been there, I wasn't.

186
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:37,853
It was many years ago.

187
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:40,589
She hurt you.

188
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,659
No, nothing like that.

189
00:19:45,095 --> 00:19:49,933
But if I had been there, I
could have made a difference.

190
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:50,866
Is she dead?

191
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:57,840
Yes, every day I think
what could have been.

192
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:05,714
You can't blame yourself
for a turn of fate.

193
00:20:08,118 --> 00:20:10,719
I don't know if
I blame myself,

194
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:14,057
but I still should
have been there.

195
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,860
I don't even know
exactly what happened,

196
00:20:17,894 --> 00:20:19,795
only partial details.

197
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:21,932
What is in your heart?

198
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,240
In the years since,
I've learned that a man

199
00:20:30,273 --> 00:20:32,075
can be responsible for someone,

200
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,147
and if he abdicates that
responsibility, he's no good.

201
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:39,983
It's like he's dead.

202
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,821
Come on, you,
you gloomy bastard.

203
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:52,661
You are the finest
man I've ever known.

204
00:20:54,364 --> 00:20:56,166
I've lived with
this for too long.

205
00:20:57,968 --> 00:20:59,802
So is this the-

206
00:21:00,703 --> 00:21:03,340
- The reason I can't
give myself completely?

207
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:07,444
But I am learning.

208
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:09,112
Confront your past.

209
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:13,049
You may be right about that.

210
00:21:15,385 --> 00:21:16,887
What was it you taught me?

211
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:25,721
Hello.

212
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:33,430
Hello?

213
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:42,505
Afternoon, how can I help you?

214
00:22:44,174 --> 00:22:46,409
Just came by to check
out the old place,

215
00:22:47,944 --> 00:22:49,346
I used to know the people here.

216
00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:53,016
Been over 10 years.

217
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:56,852
Would you fancy some
coffee? I got fresh water too.

218
00:22:56,886 --> 00:22:58,421
That's all right, but thanks.

219
00:23:00,457 --> 00:23:03,126
Sir, listen, can you tell
me what happened here?

220
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,230
Well, I just picked up this
property at County auction.

221
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,467
Oh no, you mean
that bad business

222
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,402
that happened here at
the end of the war.

223
00:23:12,435 --> 00:23:13,336
Yes.

224
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,038
Well, I lived in town then,

225
00:23:15,071 --> 00:23:20,076
but that Sawyer woman and that
little girl, they were here.

226
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:22,345
And what happened after that?

227
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:24,547
One day, the
Marshal came into town

228
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:29,785
delivering an escaped
Indian and he saw them.

229
00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:31,021
And?

230
00:23:31,054 --> 00:23:34,190
There was a woman,
she was half stripped,

231
00:23:34,224 --> 00:23:37,193
and she was shot
right in the chest.

232
00:23:37,227 --> 00:23:38,395
And the little girl,

233
00:23:38,428 --> 00:23:41,564
she was just wandering
around in a daze.

234
00:23:41,598 --> 00:23:43,300
Tell me more.

235
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,935
The story was,
that these fellows,

236
00:23:45,969 --> 00:23:49,306
they buried a cash box
somewhere around here,

237
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:53,109
and the woman came in and
saw them digging it up.

238
00:23:53,143 --> 00:23:55,578
There was a lot of that
thievery after the war,

239
00:23:55,612 --> 00:23:57,480
with Johnny Reb on the run,

240
00:23:57,514 --> 00:24:01,518
those that hadn't surrendered
to the blue coats officially,

241
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:04,087
they picked up whatever
they could find

242
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,955
and they took off to Mexico.

243
00:24:05,989 --> 00:24:08,892
Some of them even joined
up with the oysters.

244
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:10,160
What happened to the girl?

245
00:24:10,193 --> 00:24:12,162
Some say she
went to St. Louis,

246
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:14,164
well, that's where
the mother was from.

247
00:24:14,197 --> 00:24:15,332
I know.

248
00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:17,467
The County filed a
lien on the property,

249
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,402
and I picked it up
at County auction.

250
00:24:20,637 --> 00:24:22,472
Do you fancy some coffee?

251
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:34,084
It's colder than I expected.

252
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:38,388
Name is Zacharias.

253
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:40,256
If I remember my
Bible schooling,

254
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:44,094
he was the father
of John The Baptist.

255
00:24:44,127 --> 00:24:45,028
Yes sir.

256
00:24:45,061 --> 00:24:46,563
A fine name, mine's Ransom.

257
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:48,598
Pleasure.

258
00:24:51,935 --> 00:24:55,138
How long did you know the
people that I spoke of?

259
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:58,174
The woman and the little
girl, they were my life.

260
00:24:58,208 --> 00:24:59,976
You were not there

261
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:03,413
during that bad business
that happened, were you?

262
00:25:03,446 --> 00:25:05,882
I was a trail scout
for the union back then,

263
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,318
my regiment had shipped out.

264
00:25:11,488 --> 00:25:16,493
You see, this woman had a
husband who had abandoned her.

265
00:25:20,196 --> 00:25:22,565
He served with General Sibley,

266
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:29,672
he was reported as dead long
before I came into the picture.

267
00:25:30,373 --> 00:25:32,542
Why didn't you return to her?

268
00:25:32,575 --> 00:25:35,078
We were taking
the last surrender,

269
00:25:35,111 --> 00:25:37,313
of the last of
Johnny Reb's outfits.

270
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:46,689
I heard that the husband
may have been alive,

271
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:53,463
so I set out for this
place to find out.

272
00:25:57,333 --> 00:26:02,305
En route I came upon an
official casualty list,

273
00:26:05,608 --> 00:26:10,313
turns out I was wrong, there
was his name right there.

274
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:18,588
I continued on, met up with
a newspaper man I knew,

275
00:26:22,058 --> 00:26:23,626
he knew about this woman and me.

276
00:26:25,628 --> 00:26:27,630
He showed me a
newspaper clipping,

277
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:32,569
it reported her death,

278
00:26:34,337 --> 00:26:38,374
no real details, no
mention of the little girl.

279
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:42,011
Well, what did you do?

280
00:26:42,045 --> 00:26:46,149
I don't remember,
I was in a daze.

281
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:53,122
I drifted, where? I
don't even recall.

282
00:26:55,158 --> 00:26:58,027
All I know is I was set
out to come back here

283
00:26:58,061 --> 00:27:01,764
and then we ran into that
last regimen of gray coats,

284
00:27:05,268 --> 00:27:08,071
but I was bound and
determined to come back here.

285
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:10,139
It sounds like you're
blaming yourself.

286
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:15,245
I should have delivered
those sons of bitches to Satan.

287
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:18,648
Mister, a lot has
happened in my life.

288
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:24,254
I remember when I was serving
with General Franklin Pierce,

289
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:27,323
he was a New Hampshire militia,

290
00:27:27,357 --> 00:27:30,693
and we were down
in Churrobusco, Mexico.

291
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:34,163
Those days there was no
way to get word to us

292
00:27:34,197 --> 00:27:37,600
because we were so
far down into Mexico

293
00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:40,136
that nobody could
get in touch with us.

294
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:41,037
And?

295
00:27:41,972 --> 00:27:45,441
Well, let's just say
I had a big surprise

296
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:49,679
when I returned home, and find
that my pretty little wife

297
00:27:49,712 --> 00:27:53,116
had skidaddled off
with my best friend

298
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:55,451
who had a Cooper train.

299
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,187
What are you saying?

300
00:27:59,556 --> 00:28:03,826
That you cannot control
life, life controls you.

301
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,396
I don't know if I've
ever believed that.

302
00:28:08,464 --> 00:28:09,666
Do you have someone now?

303
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,836
My second wife
was my great love.

304
00:28:14,737 --> 00:28:16,306
She's not here now in person,

305
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:21,244
but she's always here by
my side and in my heart.

306
00:28:22,412 --> 00:28:26,749
Should a man be
allowed to grieve?

307
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:29,586
For as long as he wishes.

308
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:31,087
You have a woman now?

309
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:37,493
Yes, she's beautiful,
fiery, loving.

310
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:45,668
Don't you waste that.

311
00:28:53,643 --> 00:28:55,411
Thank you for the coffee,

312
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,748
gave me something to ponder.

313
00:28:58,781 --> 00:29:01,250
Sometimes it's a long
journey to get home.

314
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,789
That coffee hit the
spot, warmed me up some.

315
00:29:07,925 --> 00:29:11,594
Mister, I sure hope you find
what you're looking for.

316
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:27,911
Howdie, gentlemen.

317
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:30,380
Would you care for a little
coffee and fresh water?

318
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:32,148
Not interested, gramps.

319
00:29:33,117 --> 00:29:35,418
We're looking for some
information, though.

320
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:39,455
How long has this shit
hole been abandoned?

321
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:41,858
It ain't no more, I own it,

322
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:44,427
I intend to spend my
twilight years here.

323
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,663
You know, I've been most
things in this life,

324
00:29:46,696 --> 00:29:49,666
I've worked on the
Mississippi river,

325
00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:51,334
I sold farm implements-

326
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:54,370
- We're not interested in
your life story, old toad.

327
00:29:55,505 --> 00:29:59,208
Now what happened to them people
here before you, years ago?

328
00:29:59,242 --> 00:30:01,778
It's funny you should ask
that, there was a fellow

329
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:04,414
who went through here
a couple of days ago

330
00:30:04,447 --> 00:30:06,549
who was asking what
happened to the people

331
00:30:06,582 --> 00:30:08,384
who were here back
in those days.

332
00:30:08,418 --> 00:30:12,288
If you ask me, he knew the
widow in the biblical sense.

333
00:30:13,957 --> 00:30:15,092
Who was this man?

334
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:20,396
He was a professional man,
a shootist, probably military.

335
00:30:21,531 --> 00:30:23,901
He carried a Mason
Richards Conversion,

336
00:30:23,934 --> 00:30:26,436
rare measure type of fellow,

337
00:30:26,469 --> 00:30:29,572
the collector type, you
know, he had it all together.

338
00:30:29,605 --> 00:30:32,542
And where did he run off to?

339
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:35,211
Las Cruces,
maybe, I don't know

340
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:41,350
And, uh, he didn't take
nothing? He just rode away?

341
00:30:43,987 --> 00:30:45,521
What would he take from here?

342
00:30:47,757 --> 00:30:49,459
It's not here.

343
00:30:49,492 --> 00:30:50,860
And what's it
say in that book?

344
00:30:50,894 --> 00:30:52,829
Well that's the problem,
my ever loving brother

345
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:55,398
was more dedicated to
penning his war exploits

346
00:30:55,431 --> 00:30:57,734
than simple bit of
thievery, goddamn him.

347
00:30:59,435 --> 00:31:00,737
All right, hey, um...

348
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,440
Hell, let's get out
of this cow pie.

349
00:31:04,474 --> 00:31:06,743
Look here you mixed sparrow,

350
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:09,812
I've had enough of you thumbing
your nose at my spread.

351
00:31:13,516 --> 00:31:16,419
Now, get the hell
off of my land.

352
00:31:17,888 --> 00:31:18,956
Oh, easy there, old spider.

353
00:31:18,989 --> 00:31:21,758
Do you want me to take care
of this old man, Wild Eye?

354
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:24,560
Take that pecker pawn
you got there with you,

355
00:31:24,594 --> 00:31:26,329
and get a wiggle on.

356
00:31:26,362 --> 00:31:27,630
We're going.

357
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:28,865
Now!

358
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:34,071
We're due elsewhere,
on business.

359
00:31:34,104 --> 00:31:36,439
You loathsome sodomites.

360
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:05,002
Well, tell me what this
avenger of justice looks like?

361
00:32:05,035 --> 00:32:09,739
This son of a bitch who
shot Zebediah Scurlock down.

362
00:32:09,772 --> 00:32:12,842
Tall, dark hair,
professional demeanor.

363
00:32:13,977 --> 00:32:15,678
Is he a Pinkerton?

364
00:32:17,613 --> 00:32:20,750
No sir. He carries a
Richard Mason Conversion,

365
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:24,420
he seemed like
ex-military maybe.

366
00:32:24,453 --> 00:32:26,556
That's him,
that's the rounder.

367
00:32:26,589 --> 00:32:27,857
That old man, the one
I just told you about,

368
00:32:27,891 --> 00:32:29,625
that's the one he spoke to.

369
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:35,731
Well, he can flat
shoot, I'll give him that.

370
00:32:35,765 --> 00:32:39,036
Meet Bill Gristy,
he hails from Abilene.

371
00:32:39,069 --> 00:32:41,737
Occasionally I come here
and help Sheriff Meldin

372
00:32:41,771 --> 00:32:44,074
with a problem or two.

373
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:46,375
So you saw the whole thing.

374
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:50,379
I did, I was sitting
at a corner, way back,

375
00:32:50,413 --> 00:32:53,683
I don't think anybody
saw me in the saloon.

376
00:32:53,716 --> 00:32:56,652
Fact is I was looking
for old Zeb myself,

377
00:32:56,686 --> 00:32:58,521
saw the same handbill
down in Yuma,

378
00:32:59,689 --> 00:33:02,558
I suspect that's what brought
the other gentlemen up here.

379
00:33:02,592 --> 00:33:05,394
Well, he got him
fair and square,

380
00:33:05,428 --> 00:33:07,630
you can't get them all,
not in this business.

381
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:10,867
So this Mason
Richard sucker, he

382
00:33:11,969 --> 00:33:13,136
killed my brother.

383
00:33:14,537 --> 00:33:15,906
I only knew

384
00:33:15,939 --> 00:33:18,774
when he brought him we knew
something about that box.

385
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:21,477
Now, don't get anything
started here, boys.

386
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,881
Oh no, not to worry law man.

387
00:33:23,914 --> 00:33:28,484
I mean, I'm just tracking
down a family heirloom.

388
00:33:30,753 --> 00:33:33,522
Well, good day gentlemen.

389
00:33:40,663 --> 00:33:42,431
So what's the
low down, Wild Eye?

390
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:48,638
I figure that man hunter
must be about a week's ride

391
00:33:48,671 --> 00:33:51,707
ahead of us, in any direction.

392
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:57,114
And that old man, now he said
he was headed to Las Cruces.

393
00:33:59,815 --> 00:34:02,518
Zeb was always a flapjack,
so maybe he let loose

394
00:34:02,551 --> 00:34:05,022
with the location
to this bastard,

395
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:06,555
to where that cash box was,

396
00:34:07,623 --> 00:34:09,993
you know, in a
plead for his life.

397
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:13,997
Well, that there dandy
might cause us some despair.

398
00:34:15,132 --> 00:34:17,067
Despair?

399
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,136
Now why the hell do
you always look down

400
00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:20,836
the dark side of the road?

401
00:34:22,172 --> 00:34:24,074
You illiterate bastard.

402
00:34:25,841 --> 00:34:27,077
Let's go get the horses.

403
00:34:46,263 --> 00:34:49,865
My God, it really is you.

404
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:53,869
I'm sorry, young lady, you
have me at a disadvantage.

405
00:34:56,206 --> 00:34:58,041
I never thought
I'd see you again.

406
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:04,714
Have we met?

407
00:35:05,848 --> 00:35:07,750
The little ranch
outside of Santa Fe,

408
00:35:09,152 --> 00:35:10,820
12 or more years ago?

409
00:35:12,155 --> 00:35:14,757
It was the happiest time of
my life, brief as it was.

410
00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:18,028
The Sawyer place?

411
00:35:20,763 --> 00:35:21,597
Are you-

412
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,498
- I am Promise Sawyer.

413
00:35:26,169 --> 00:35:28,771
I was just out at the
old place a few weeks ago.

414
00:35:29,705 --> 00:35:33,076
Tell me, where have you
been all these years?

415
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,544
We have much to discuss,

416
00:35:35,578 --> 00:35:38,248
meet me in the parlor of the
Elysium hotel in an hour.

417
00:36:09,845 --> 00:36:13,150
That day you left, I asked
mama when you would return,

418
00:36:14,683 --> 00:36:18,854
she said you were a man
who lived on his own terms.

419
00:36:20,357 --> 00:36:21,925
Why did you leave us?

420
00:36:24,394 --> 00:36:28,965
I don't, I don't know what
was in my heart at that time.

421
00:36:33,336 --> 00:36:36,605
I'll never forget the beautiful
cross you gave to mama.

422
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:39,342
Yeah, it was in
my family for years,

423
00:36:40,243 --> 00:36:43,612
it was all that was
left of a life long ago.

424
00:36:45,982 --> 00:36:47,817
I was a contract
scout for the union

425
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,119
before I met your mother.

426
00:36:50,853 --> 00:36:53,156
The war was at its
end, we were mopping up

427
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,359
the final remnants of the Rebs
that had not yet surrendered.

428
00:36:57,461 --> 00:37:00,931
I was looking forward to a
life of peace and tranquility,

429
00:37:02,265 --> 00:37:04,633
I found it on that
little place of yours.

430
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:09,738
Then I drifted,
like a damned fool,

431
00:37:11,174 --> 00:37:13,176
I've known very little
peace since then.

432
00:37:15,412 --> 00:37:18,681
It was as if God had
sent you to watch over us.

433
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:24,254
I believed you truly
cared about us.

434
00:37:24,287 --> 00:37:26,822
I did, and I do now.

435
00:37:41,338 --> 00:37:45,275
You read to me, from
Sutonia's, as I recall.

436
00:37:47,377 --> 00:37:50,779
Well, I was always interested
in historical subjects.

437
00:37:51,714 --> 00:37:54,251
Your mother had one of
the finest libraries

438
00:37:54,284 --> 00:37:55,218
I have ever seen.

439
00:37:58,054 --> 00:38:00,924
So what happened to you in
the years leading up till now?

440
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,428
I stayed on for
about two years,

441
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:10,167
mama had a stash of gold coins
which had belonged to Papa.

442
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,968
The ruffians never found
them when they tore

443
00:38:12,002 --> 00:38:12,936
through the house.

444
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,342
I had some help from some
of the folks in town,

445
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:23,846
but when the money ran out and
the debts could not be paid,

446
00:38:27,284 --> 00:38:28,751
I abandoned the property.

447
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,388
To make my way in this world

448
00:38:31,421 --> 00:38:35,758
I had to make
certain compromises,

449
00:38:36,893 --> 00:38:40,430
which young ladies of moral
conscience would never accept,

450
00:38:40,463 --> 00:38:45,101
but I made them, and I survived.

451
00:38:46,236 --> 00:38:47,103
I thrived.

452
00:38:49,506 --> 00:38:50,440
Do you understand?

453
00:39:02,118 --> 00:39:04,354
Due to the world I inhabited,

454
00:39:04,387 --> 00:39:07,790
I've learned salient facts
about the underbelly of society.

455
00:39:08,857 --> 00:39:11,361
I catalogued this information
and used it to find

456
00:39:11,394 --> 00:39:13,129
these men who scarred my
soul.

457
00:39:14,464 --> 00:39:16,865
They left a trail of
slime like wet snails

458
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,168
from here to New Orleans,

459
00:39:18,201 --> 00:39:20,971
and spent the years
dedicated to treachery,

460
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:22,439
and double crossing each other.

461
00:39:23,607 --> 00:39:26,742
None of them ever made it to
Mexico as was their intent,

462
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:29,980
eventually two of them
were hanged in San Antonio

463
00:39:30,013 --> 00:39:31,081
for horse rustling.

464
00:39:33,283 --> 00:39:35,151
You wish to know
the final irony?

465
00:39:35,185 --> 00:39:36,052
Yes.

466
00:39:39,055 --> 00:39:40,924
I was in Tucumcari recently,

467
00:39:40,957 --> 00:39:44,294
and there was a news
periodical report about you.

468
00:39:46,062 --> 00:39:47,130
The man you shot,

469
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:51,001
was the leader of that
gutter trash that night,

470
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:55,438
Zebediah Scurlock.

471
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,178
I never forgot their faces.

472
00:40:05,949 --> 00:40:10,954
I have spent too long
chasing this, living this,

473
00:40:18,028 --> 00:40:20,563
it appears you're still
my guardian and protector,

474
00:40:20,597 --> 00:40:22,399
whether you know it or not.

475
00:40:26,136 --> 00:40:29,005
This man had a
reward on his head,

476
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:31,474
and $50 I took from
him in a poker game.

477
00:40:32,976 --> 00:40:36,212
No gold, no fortune, nothing,

478
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,115
your journey is at an end.

479
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:45,088
Not quite, there's
the cash box.

480
00:40:48,658 --> 00:40:50,093
Why flirt with danger?

481
00:40:51,027 --> 00:40:53,263
Those three vermins
have been sent to hell,

482
00:40:54,464 --> 00:40:56,232
you've made a good
life for yourself.

483
00:40:59,502 --> 00:41:01,938
There's nothing to be
gained by chasing the past,

484
00:41:01,971 --> 00:41:03,340
you'll only find heartbreak.

485
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:06,142
There is something in that
cash box that I must have.

486
00:41:06,176 --> 00:41:08,411
And there's nothing wrong
with chasing the past,

487
00:41:08,445 --> 00:41:11,381
so long as the past holds
the key to one's freedom.

488
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:13,416
Maybe.

489
00:41:15,118 --> 00:41:17,053
I just may have a
scrap of information

490
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:19,122
which may prove valuable.

491
00:41:19,155 --> 00:41:21,524
Come with me and help
me complete my journey.

492
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:27,197
Tell me,

493
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:32,969
why must we ever give
up our innocence?

494
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:56,426
You know,
I've been thinking.

495
00:41:56,459 --> 00:41:57,560
No shit.

496
00:41:57,594 --> 00:41:59,396
I've been thinking
that maybe we really don't need

497
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:00,363
to be doing all this.

498
00:42:00,397 --> 00:42:02,399
Oh, there you go.

499
00:42:02,432 --> 00:42:06,703
You wanna spend a lifetime
chewing stock or selling nails?

500
00:42:06,736 --> 00:42:08,705
There's a fortune
sitting in that cash box,

501
00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:11,307
and all we gotta do is find it.

502
00:42:12,675 --> 00:42:15,345
And that little girl
might still be alive,

503
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:18,381
that man on her probably
knows where she's at,

504
00:42:19,649 --> 00:42:20,583
we'll follow them.

505
00:42:22,252 --> 00:42:25,021
In some ways I think, you
not being able to read,

506
00:42:25,054 --> 00:42:26,423
gets in the way
of your brain pan

507
00:42:26,456 --> 00:42:27,957
from seeing the big picture,

508
00:42:27,991 --> 00:42:29,192
like you is dimwitted.

509
00:42:29,225 --> 00:42:31,694
All right, now you cut
that talk, all right?

510
00:42:31,728 --> 00:42:33,563
I've shot men for
lesser insult.

511
00:42:35,331 --> 00:42:38,234
I'm smart, dammit,
I ain't no fool.

512
00:42:38,268 --> 00:42:39,636
All right, all right,

513
00:42:39,669 --> 00:42:42,038
I forgot you were such a
little panty

514
00:42:42,071 --> 00:42:43,072
All I'm saying-

515
00:42:43,106 --> 00:42:45,475
- It seems like we're chasing
windmills, that's all.

516
00:42:45,508 --> 00:42:48,711
Windmills? Well, aint
you the literary scholar.

517
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,714
Listen, what I'm saying is,

518
00:42:51,748 --> 00:42:54,217
I've had it with being on
the tail end of the draw.

519
00:42:55,385 --> 00:42:59,389
This is my chance to even up
the bad deck I've been dealt.

520
00:42:59,422 --> 00:43:03,460
My dear departed brother,
he went through a life time

521
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:06,196
with a marauder mean
stream than a kindler one,

522
00:43:06,229 --> 00:43:07,597
but he made...

523
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:10,200
Well, he didn't make big
coin, but he did all right.

524
00:43:11,801 --> 00:43:16,639
Maybe it's time I
learnt from his ways.

525
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,658
Inn-keeper, two beers.

526
00:43:40,463 --> 00:43:42,031
One other thing,

527
00:43:42,065 --> 00:43:44,033
I need some information.

528
00:43:44,801 --> 00:43:47,103
We be looking for a gentleman

529
00:43:47,136 --> 00:43:50,173
who may have rode
through this way.

530
00:43:50,206 --> 00:43:51,641
Senor, I do not interfere

531
00:43:51,674 --> 00:43:53,076
with matters that
do not concern me.

532
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:56,179
It can prove to be unhealthy.

533
00:43:56,212 --> 00:43:59,415
What may prove to be
unhealthy is your indifference.

534
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:05,288
I'm looking for a tall,
dark, quiet son of a bitch,

535
00:44:05,855 --> 00:44:07,490
carrying a Mason Rich.

536
00:44:07,524 --> 00:44:08,825
Perhaps you should try
the Sheriff's office,

537
00:44:08,858 --> 00:44:11,794
or the hotels perhaps?
I do not know him.

538
00:44:11,828 --> 00:44:13,796
All right then.

539
00:44:15,431 --> 00:44:19,435
But I will remember whether
or not you told me the truth.

540
00:44:47,864 --> 00:44:49,599
Inn-keeper, dos mas.

541
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:04,347
Now, I'm gonna go over
there, you stay here.

542
00:45:14,757 --> 00:45:18,194
Howdie friend, what
brings you to town?

543
00:45:22,532 --> 00:45:26,436
What I mean is that
it sure is good to see

544
00:45:26,469 --> 00:45:29,172
somebody new ride through.

545
00:45:29,205 --> 00:45:30,473
Aint that right, Brick?

546
00:45:35,712 --> 00:45:38,681
We're heading to Tucumcari.

547
00:45:41,317 --> 00:45:45,355
On business, ever
been there, friend?

548
00:45:51,527 --> 00:45:55,365
Listen, I don't mind a little
small talk to pass the time,

549
00:45:55,398 --> 00:45:58,401
but I don't see that my travels
are any concern of yours.

550
00:46:03,439 --> 00:46:07,677
Well, I happen to know
you've been there, friend.

551
00:46:10,279 --> 00:46:13,917
Fact is, you made use

552
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:17,253
of that fancy hog leg
of yours in Tucumcari.

553
00:46:18,354 --> 00:46:21,691
You fetched yourself
a handsome reward

554
00:46:21,724 --> 00:46:26,729
further down in Yuma, all
for a few minutes work.

555
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:38,909
I think I understand
why you fellows do it.

556
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:45,548
Hell, I've man hunted a few
times myself, since the war.

557
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:56,826
Everything all right
over here, Wild Eye?

558
00:46:56,859 --> 00:47:01,798
Yes sir. Me and this gentleman
are just get an acquainted.

559
00:47:11,374 --> 00:47:12,675
Allow me to venture a guess

560
00:47:12,709 --> 00:47:15,712
as to who you two
gentlemen might be.

561
00:47:24,454 --> 00:47:29,459
You'd be one, Brick Logan,
AKA, the stone mason.

562
00:47:30,727 --> 00:47:34,263
You had a lucrative
business reselling the same

563
00:47:34,297 --> 00:47:38,367
rebranded herd three or four
times back in West, Texas.

564
00:47:40,904 --> 00:47:42,839
Before that, you had
a pretty fair turn

565
00:47:42,872 --> 00:47:45,241
with those traveling,
sporting ladies.

566
00:47:46,442 --> 00:47:50,480
Unfortunately, every customer
got clubbed and picked clean,

567
00:47:50,513 --> 00:47:52,582
not to mention a dose.

568
00:47:52,615 --> 00:47:54,350
The Rangers got close to you,

569
00:47:55,986 --> 00:47:57,955
right after the rape
charge was filed.

570
00:48:00,057 --> 00:48:04,327
When they eventually got
you, you beat a night guard

571
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,728
within an inch of his life,

572
00:48:08,397 --> 00:48:10,067
that's when the judge
issued the warrant

573
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,601
and the price on your head.

574
00:48:13,669 --> 00:48:17,440
Don't worry, I don't fancy
a trip to Texas right now.

575
00:48:19,776 --> 00:48:23,780
I have no clue who you are,
except you must be some relation

576
00:48:23,813 --> 00:48:25,748
to that dead meat
I dropped in Yuma.

577
00:48:28,518 --> 00:48:30,353
Now, if you'll
excuse me, gentlemen,

578
00:48:31,721 --> 00:48:34,390
I think that's all we need
to know about each other.

579
00:48:40,797 --> 00:48:41,664
Adios.

580
00:48:47,436 --> 00:48:48,838
How the hell we know he
ain't gonna come back here

581
00:48:48,871 --> 00:48:49,940
and get me?

582
00:48:49,973 --> 00:48:53,743
How the hell is it you never
told me you was a rapist?

583
00:48:55,578 --> 00:48:56,412
I like rape.

584
00:48:56,445 --> 00:48:57,480
Oh shut your yap.

585
00:48:58,748 --> 00:49:00,951
It's becoming
clear why your face

586
00:49:00,984 --> 00:49:03,419
is pinging on a wanted
poster in.

587
00:49:06,924 --> 00:49:09,725
Come on.

588
00:49:09,759 --> 00:49:12,628
Let's go see where
that fellow go.

589
00:49:19,602 --> 00:49:20,938
This is senseless.

590
00:49:22,605 --> 00:49:23,472
Fugitive?

591
00:49:30,613 --> 00:49:31,814
You coming out?

592
00:49:41,724 --> 00:49:43,626
You are wearing on my patience.

593
00:49:46,629 --> 00:49:50,366
You will only succeed in
arousing my deeper anger,

594
00:49:53,436 --> 00:49:56,806
and when that
occurs, hell follows.

595
00:49:59,009 --> 00:50:03,479
I hold here, a handbill stating
you are wanted for robbery

596
00:50:03,512 --> 00:50:06,449
in Santa Fe, New
Mexico territory,

597
00:50:06,482 --> 00:50:09,019
it concludes you may
be armed and dangerous.

598
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:12,488
Are you coming out?

599
00:50:18,195 --> 00:50:21,031
All right, I'm coming out.

600
00:50:21,064 --> 00:50:23,499
No tricks.

601
00:50:23,532 --> 00:50:28,537
No tricks, I pride myself
on those I keep alive.

602
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:35,678
That's right, nice and easy.

603
00:50:41,952 --> 00:50:43,020
Kiss God's creation.

604
00:50:45,122 --> 00:50:45,989
Spread out.

605
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,061
You are wise.

606
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:58,801
You know, in some parts I am
more feared than the almighty.

607
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:04,440
All right, get up.

608
00:51:10,546 --> 00:51:11,447
Where's your mount?

609
00:51:13,016 --> 00:51:15,651
Down the street, the
telegraph office.

610
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,587
Well, that don't matter.

611
00:51:19,923 --> 00:51:21,524
Let's take a walk.

612
00:51:40,143 --> 00:51:42,645
It's at moments like this,

613
00:51:42,678 --> 00:51:46,716
where I can truly appreciate
the wonder of God's works.

614
00:51:47,884 --> 00:51:50,187
The sublime nature
of the topography,

615
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:55,892
the blue overhanging
firmament, makes you wonder.

616
00:51:59,896 --> 00:52:01,264
Makes you wonder.

617
00:52:01,298 --> 00:52:03,632
It makes you happy to draw
his breath, does it not?

618
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:09,239
What's gonna happen to me?

619
00:52:09,272 --> 00:52:13,010
Well, I suspect, straight
to the territorial prison.

620
00:52:13,043 --> 00:52:14,311
I can't go back there.

621
00:52:14,344 --> 00:52:16,545
I do not believe
you have a say in it.

622
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:21,684
Listen, friend.

623
00:52:21,717 --> 00:52:22,752
I'm not your friend.

624
00:52:22,785 --> 00:52:26,289
Listen, I have
some information

625
00:52:26,323 --> 00:52:29,159
which may prove more to your
liking than turning me in.

626
00:52:29,192 --> 00:52:31,761
And what would that be?

627
00:52:31,794 --> 00:52:33,196
Well, before you tracked me,

628
00:52:34,131 --> 00:52:36,565
I was making a trail
to a veritable fortune.

629
00:52:37,968 --> 00:52:41,104
See, I rode with this
fellow for a few months,

630
00:52:41,138 --> 00:52:43,206
quite a bit older than
me, ex quantro man.

631
00:52:44,341 --> 00:52:47,877
Well sir, he had the most
goddamn amazing tale to tell.

632
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,315
It seems that there was this
cash box of Confederate gold,

633
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:54,918
that was heisted in the
last days of the late war.

634
00:52:56,286 --> 00:52:58,587
These fellows buried it
and they dug it up again.

635
00:52:59,523 --> 00:53:02,059
Years went by and no one
knew of its existence,

636
00:53:03,326 --> 00:53:06,296
well, I know the location
of this cash box.

637
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:09,199
In fact, my late partner
and I were headed to get it

638
00:53:09,232 --> 00:53:11,867
when he got killed in Tucumcari.

639
00:53:11,902 --> 00:53:14,670
I was headed there myself
before you caught up with me.

640
00:53:14,703 --> 00:53:16,106
Why are you telling me this?

641
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:18,909
How much do you stand to gain
from the bounty on my head?

642
00:53:19,809 --> 00:53:20,911
$250.

643
00:53:20,944 --> 00:53:22,678
What if I could
guarantee you thousands.

644
00:53:22,711 --> 00:53:26,283
For the love of money is
the root of all kinds of evil,

645
00:53:26,316 --> 00:53:28,919
it is through this craving
that many have wandered away

646
00:53:28,952 --> 00:53:31,854
from the faith, pierced
themselves with many pain.

647
00:53:31,888 --> 00:53:34,391
Damn it, man. What I'm saying
is I know the whereabouts

648
00:53:34,424 --> 00:53:36,625
of an untraceable fortune.

649
00:53:36,659 --> 00:53:39,695
All right, well, if you
want to tell me this tale,

650
00:53:39,728 --> 00:53:43,100
it may ensure a more interesting
ride to our destination.

651
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:47,037
A cash box of unregistered
Confederate gold

652
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:49,705
waits in a church
not far from here.

653
00:53:49,738 --> 00:53:51,607
No one knows of its existence.

654
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:54,844
Now for the last six
months, I rode with a man

655
00:53:54,877 --> 00:53:57,646
who spoke up nothing
but this gold

656
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,950
and the efforts to
find it day and night.

657
00:54:01,284 --> 00:54:02,852
Then there were the tales
of those who rode with him,

658
00:54:02,886 --> 00:54:04,387
also promised a
part of this gold

659
00:54:04,421 --> 00:54:05,989
and how he betrayed them.

660
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:08,992
Damn it man, what I'm
saying is I can lead you

661
00:54:09,025 --> 00:54:10,227
to this cash box.

662
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,129
If I do not turn you in.

663
00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:15,899
Well yeah, that's
the general idea.

664
00:54:15,932 --> 00:54:19,236
Those who desire to be
rich fall into temptation,

665
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:23,873
into a snare, into many
senseless and harmful desires

666
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:27,043
that plunge them into
destruction and ruin.

667
00:54:28,178 --> 00:54:30,313
Mr, I can't go
back to that jail.

668
00:54:30,347 --> 00:54:33,383
Believe me, a pot
of gold awaits,

669
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:36,286
give me the chance
to show it to you.

670
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,322
All right, all right, all
right. Satisfy my curiosity.

671
00:54:39,356 --> 00:54:41,191
But do not insult
my intelligence.

672
00:54:43,226 --> 00:54:45,295
What was the name of this
devil you rode in with?

673
00:54:45,328 --> 00:54:47,763
Zebediah Scurlock.

674
00:54:47,796 --> 00:54:50,333
I know this man you speak of,

675
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,935
I was after him myself, whoa.

676
00:54:55,071 --> 00:54:56,739
Tell me more of what you know.

677
00:55:04,214 --> 00:55:05,182
Whoa, whoa.

678
00:55:17,994 --> 00:55:20,030
Location of this
booty is a certainty?

679
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,164
Absolutely.

680
00:55:21,198 --> 00:55:23,300
You would not be
leading me into a trap?

681
00:55:25,268 --> 00:55:26,769
I know my future, friend.

682
00:55:28,438 --> 00:55:30,473
I'm just trying to buy
off the inevitable.

683
00:55:31,807 --> 00:55:33,410
I'm resigned that
I am hell bound.

684
00:55:38,814 --> 00:55:39,848
You are so right.

685
00:55:43,253 --> 00:55:44,254
Goddammit!

686
00:55:50,126 --> 00:55:53,729
Fact is, partner, you
are only worth $250.

687
00:55:55,098 --> 00:55:57,000
Now, I've been known to be
a gambling man on occasion,

688
00:55:57,033 --> 00:55:59,169
and I've entered a gamble

689
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:01,171
that what you're
telling me is the truth.

690
00:56:01,204 --> 00:56:05,508
Therefore, I stand to reap a
more sizeable reward this way.

691
00:56:05,542 --> 00:56:06,875
You were not wanted for murder,

692
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,979
so I did not shoot
you through the heart.

693
00:56:09,879 --> 00:56:12,282
Consider this your
debt paid to society,

694
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:14,517
for your peace with God.

695
00:56:16,286 --> 00:56:18,021
You might get thirsty out here.

696
00:56:19,022 --> 00:56:20,156
You bastard!

697
00:56:39,342 --> 00:56:44,347
♪ Lay down to sleep, child ♪

698
00:56:45,915 --> 00:56:50,920
♪ Lay down with the Lord ♪

699
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:57,527
♪ If the devil finds you ♪

700
00:56:59,195 --> 00:57:02,432
♪ Send him back to hell ♪

701
00:57:05,935 --> 00:57:10,173
Oh hello, I have told
you some of my life

702
00:57:10,206 --> 00:57:12,275
in the last dozen years.

703
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:13,176
Yes.

704
00:57:16,913 --> 00:57:18,148
Now, the details.

705
00:57:19,516 --> 00:57:23,520
To survive I was forced to
make certain hard choices,

706
00:57:23,553 --> 00:57:25,889
most of the women my
age in this territory

707
00:57:25,922 --> 00:57:27,157
are married with children.

708
00:57:28,391 --> 00:57:31,428
A reason that no respectable
man would take me

709
00:57:31,461 --> 00:57:33,229
once he knew my true story,

710
00:57:35,165 --> 00:57:37,233
so I never let a man
get that close to me.

711
00:57:40,503 --> 00:57:42,005
As a whore I thrived,

712
00:57:42,038 --> 00:57:44,274
so I never had any reason
for a man in my life

713
00:57:44,307 --> 00:57:47,944
longer than a day, a week.

714
00:57:49,012 --> 00:57:50,313
I grew to accept this.

715
00:57:52,382 --> 00:57:53,483
I would never
cast judgment on-

716
00:57:53,516 --> 00:57:56,052
- I am certain
that you would not,

717
00:57:56,086 --> 00:57:58,154
you know how to read
a person's true soul.

718
00:57:59,522 --> 00:58:02,959
This life brought me money,
and some degree of respect

719
00:58:02,992 --> 00:58:04,194
from the men who knew me.

720
00:58:08,398 --> 00:58:10,533
One of the girls in
the house with me,

721
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:14,637
she knew a man,
older, tough, ex-army,

722
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:17,173
he rode through town every
six weeks to see her.

723
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:21,144
One evening he told
her about a cash box

724
00:58:21,177 --> 00:58:23,646
that had been hidden
during the war,

725
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,349
it was to be his
stake for the future,

726
00:58:26,383 --> 00:58:28,385
and it remained
hidden for years.

727
00:58:29,986 --> 00:58:31,421
He betrayed the men
who rode with him

728
00:58:31,454 --> 00:58:33,123
and he held it for himself.

729
00:58:35,024 --> 00:58:38,495
This man carried a journal
which chronicled his exploits

730
00:58:38,528 --> 00:58:40,663
over the previous 20
years, and in that journal,

731
00:58:40,697 --> 00:58:44,467
there was a page indicating
the location of the cash box.

732
00:58:45,735 --> 00:58:46,836
He tore it out and
gave it to her,

733
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:50,640
I guess he had planned to run
away with her at some point.

734
00:58:50,673 --> 00:58:53,276
When she described the
man and the cash box,

735
00:58:54,744 --> 00:58:56,980
I knew it could only be him.

736
00:58:57,013 --> 00:58:58,381
She showed me the page.

737
00:58:59,482 --> 00:59:01,017
Where's the page now?

738
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:01,918
Here,

739
00:59:03,019 --> 00:59:03,686
and here.

740
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:10,693
This man, had the bad
luck of meeting you

741
00:59:10,727 --> 00:59:13,430
in Tucumcari, six months later.

742
00:59:13,463 --> 00:59:14,697
I knew the others were dead,

743
00:59:14,731 --> 00:59:16,433
I was on the trail
of this Scurlock

744
00:59:16,466 --> 00:59:18,635
when you stepped back
into this story again.

745
00:59:21,738 --> 00:59:23,473
You intend to
find this cash box?

746
00:59:23,506 --> 00:59:24,374
Naturally.

747
00:59:26,476 --> 00:59:29,612
I was hoping I could talk
you into coming along.

748
00:59:29,646 --> 00:59:32,449
I don't have much, but I can
pay you a by the mile fee.

749
00:59:40,623 --> 00:59:43,626
I'll go, and you
owe me nothing.

750
00:59:44,727 --> 00:59:47,597
Besides, I might prove useful
in something like this.

751
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,102
Are you certain this
is what you want?

752
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:02,312
I know they've been
in there quite a while,

753
01:00:02,345 --> 01:00:04,047
they must be up to something.

754
01:00:06,649 --> 01:00:09,185
Yeah, from now on, we'll
keep a close eye on them,

755
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:11,421
see whether they've been
splitting up or not.

756
01:00:13,623 --> 01:00:14,724
Go, go, follow him.

757
01:00:14,757 --> 01:00:18,561
I'll see what I can find in
that little woman's hotel room.

758
01:00:18,595 --> 01:00:19,462
Go!

759
01:00:22,265 --> 01:00:23,968
Dumb son of a bitch.

760
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:27,824
I know you're still here

761
01:02:27,857 --> 01:02:30,760
but it seems like
you already left.

762
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:37,800
I fear that this is going
to be a good long absence.

763
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:41,337
However long it takes.

764
01:02:42,672 --> 01:02:46,142
That's what I treasure,
a man who is specific.

765
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:53,884
Please, Francesca, ever
since I learned the story

766
01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:56,252
of Tess and the little girl-

767
01:02:56,285 --> 01:02:58,221
- But you are with me now.

768
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:03,559
I wanted to confront
your past, not live in it.

769
01:03:09,967 --> 01:03:11,367
It is important to me.

770
01:03:12,936 --> 01:03:16,506
I once read a book
when I was a school girl,

771
01:03:17,573 --> 01:03:22,545
it was about a man who
descended the circles of hell

772
01:03:23,312 --> 01:03:24,347
to find the truth.

773
01:03:25,548 --> 01:03:26,416
I know it.

774
01:03:27,784 --> 01:03:30,921
I never finished it, so
I don't know how it ends.

775
01:03:30,954 --> 01:03:31,854
Shall I tell you?

776
01:03:31,889 --> 01:03:35,291
No, I'm sure it ends sadly.

777
01:03:35,324 --> 01:03:36,592
But it doesn't.

778
01:03:39,862 --> 01:03:42,331
Promise me one thing.

779
01:03:42,365 --> 01:03:43,232
Yes?

780
01:03:44,801 --> 01:03:47,637
Don't let all
we have end sadly.

781
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:55,878
That even if you decide
never to come back to me,

782
01:03:57,081 --> 01:04:01,350
that you're gonna let me know
that you are alive and safe.

783
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:10,660
I once thought you were free,

784
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:13,229
it seems so irrelevant now.

785
01:05:18,929 --> 01:05:21,999
They might try to jump
us if we get this cash box.

786
01:05:23,133 --> 01:05:24,500
What do you say
we go to the edge

787
01:05:24,534 --> 01:05:27,670
of what's left of this
town, and just observe?

788
01:05:28,871 --> 01:05:30,040
If you think that's best.

789
01:05:30,073 --> 01:05:32,976
I do, let's go.

790
01:05:43,987 --> 01:05:48,558
They stopped again, the
hair might be standing up

791
01:05:48,591 --> 01:05:50,593
on the back of that
stranger's neck.

792
01:05:51,527 --> 01:05:54,031
He'd be the type to
know he's bein' tracked.

793
01:05:58,467 --> 01:06:01,038
Aint no question they're
heading for that cash box.

794
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:05,741
Since we know their
destination, we gotta...

795
01:06:07,044 --> 01:06:09,412
I'm gonna figure a way
to get there before them.

796
01:06:17,054 --> 01:06:19,689
We approach from the North
side, come on let's git.

797
01:06:19,722 --> 01:06:21,091
Wild Eye, I got an idea, what-

798
01:06:21,124 --> 01:06:23,593
- I gotta take a shit but we
aint got time for neither,

799
01:06:23,626 --> 01:06:24,694
now come on, let's git.

800
01:06:26,729 --> 01:06:28,065
When you
arrive at the church,

801
01:06:28,098 --> 01:06:30,100
go to the crypt named Carson.

802
01:06:30,133 --> 01:06:33,769
Inside it you'll find a
panel below a small panel,

803
01:06:33,803 --> 01:06:36,039
now remove the panel
and you will find

804
01:06:36,073 --> 01:06:38,374
the cash box hidden inside.

805
01:07:40,836 --> 01:07:43,706
Who's there? I heard a noise.

806
01:07:46,043 --> 01:07:47,443
My name is Father Thomas,

807
01:07:48,844 --> 01:07:50,881
I'm the last of our faith
in this house of God,

808
01:07:50,914 --> 01:07:52,848
and as you may have
surmised I'm blind.

809
01:07:57,187 --> 01:08:01,624
I thought the place was
abandoned, seems the town is.

810
01:08:02,758 --> 01:08:04,094
Cholera visited
the town last year,

811
01:08:04,127 --> 01:08:06,662
all those not afflicted
by the plague left.

812
01:08:07,563 --> 01:08:09,732
I decided to stay with
this house of God,

813
01:08:11,134 --> 01:08:13,703
blindness afflicted
me some months ago.

814
01:08:13,736 --> 01:08:18,708
Where are your candles,
your crosses, your relics?

815
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:21,777
The parish sent
two priests to remove

816
01:08:21,811 --> 01:08:24,480
all the church valuables
after blindness set upon me.

817
01:08:25,614 --> 01:08:26,950
They offered to take
me to a monastery

818
01:08:26,984 --> 01:08:30,686
but I chose to stay
where God chose me to be.

819
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,788
So there's nothing else here?

820
01:08:34,224 --> 01:08:38,261
Myself, a few
robes, one Bible,

821
01:08:38,295 --> 01:08:40,263
all the rest was taken away.

822
01:08:41,264 --> 01:08:43,532
Where did they
take everything?

823
01:08:43,566 --> 01:08:45,801
To the monastery in Santa Rio?

824
01:08:45,835 --> 01:08:46,736
Excuse me, Father.

825
01:08:46,769 --> 01:08:48,038
Do you wish to pray with me?

826
01:08:53,576 --> 01:08:56,645
I am a God-fearing man,
Father,

827
01:08:57,981 --> 01:09:00,050
but right now I
have much business,

828
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:03,253
maybe next time.

829
01:09:04,854 --> 01:09:08,125
I understand my son, death
is all that is left here.

830
01:09:17,334 --> 01:09:21,304
I knew it, they knew
right where to go.

831
01:09:21,338 --> 01:09:23,706
Something I forgot to mention,

832
01:09:26,043 --> 01:09:27,911
yesterday when we
set off I noticed

833
01:09:27,944 --> 01:09:30,280
the journal page was
missing from my velice.

834
01:09:32,681 --> 01:09:34,550
Perhaps I left it
in the hotel room.

835
01:09:35,851 --> 01:09:38,055
Or perhaps those two have it.

836
01:09:41,191 --> 01:09:44,227
Oh, son of a bitch.

837
01:09:44,261 --> 01:09:45,128
No.

838
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:08,051
Sweet Jesus!

839
01:10:13,656 --> 01:10:16,993
Shit, that son of a
bitch got here first.

840
01:10:25,402 --> 01:10:27,237
My dear God, what
is happening here?

841
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:29,973
I heard a crash, is there
more than one of you?

842
01:10:30,006 --> 01:10:31,274
Sorry, padre.

843
01:10:32,741 --> 01:10:34,111
Look, Father, I'm just leaving.

844
01:10:34,144 --> 01:10:36,313
Are you associated with
a man who was here earlier,

845
01:10:36,346 --> 01:10:38,181
ransacking what is
left at my church?

846
01:10:38,215 --> 01:10:40,716
Oh, empty, you've
been here ready?

847
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:46,289
Si padre, a
with a tiny woman?

848
01:10:47,424 --> 01:10:48,724
It was just one man.

849
01:10:48,757 --> 01:10:51,027
Well, I'm looking for him.

850
01:10:51,061 --> 01:10:55,265
You see he's uh, he's
wanted by the law.

851
01:10:55,298 --> 01:10:57,000
I fear this once noble village

852
01:10:57,033 --> 01:10:59,136
has become a haven for brigands.

853
01:10:59,169 --> 01:11:00,904
It seems they like
its emptiness,

854
01:11:02,205 --> 01:11:04,773
if only these souls would
come here to be saved.

855
01:11:04,807 --> 01:11:09,812
Yeah, this fellow say
where he was headed?

856
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:12,883
I had the impression he
was headed for Santa Rio.

857
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:15,285
I don't know this for certain,
but once I relayed to him

858
01:11:15,318 --> 01:11:18,288
that this is where the artifacts
from my church were taken,

859
01:11:18,321 --> 01:11:20,157
he left suddenly.

860
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:23,360
He didn't exude an evil aura,

861
01:11:23,393 --> 01:11:26,129
but one never truly knows
the nature of a man's soul.

862
01:11:27,464 --> 01:11:28,331
Yeah.

863
01:11:33,503 --> 01:11:34,371
Hey!

864
01:11:38,807 --> 01:11:40,343
Stand and deliver,
you bastard.

865
01:11:40,377 --> 01:11:44,080
Oh hell, you
gotta be kidding me.

866
01:11:44,114 --> 01:11:46,016
We all being in
a tight spot here,

867
01:11:46,049 --> 01:11:49,386
we aim on taking every
last red cent from you.

868
01:11:49,419 --> 01:11:50,819
A ghost town like this,

869
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:53,256
is a right hide away
from ne'er do wells.

870
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:55,458
I ain't got time of this.

871
01:11:58,962 --> 01:12:00,163
I was worried about that.

872
01:12:06,136 --> 01:12:08,271
Goddamn, I can't
stand amateurs.

873
01:12:10,473 --> 01:12:11,807
Oh, what's gong on?

874
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,809
My God, have you
finally forsaken me?

875
01:12:15,545 --> 01:12:17,948
Wu!

876
01:12:17,981 --> 01:12:19,916
You see that? Damn!

877
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:22,485
Dumb bastard, he was a priest.

878
01:12:22,519 --> 01:12:24,221
Oh, hell, that
could've been anybody.

879
01:12:24,254 --> 01:12:26,223
No, you're an
illiterate bastard,

880
01:12:26,256 --> 01:12:29,326
and you're also a half wit
with an itchy trigger finger.

881
01:12:30,527 --> 01:12:33,263
I warned you, Wild Eye,

882
01:12:33,296 --> 01:12:34,531
aint no cause for that talk.

883
01:12:34,564 --> 01:12:37,766
Oh, shut the hell up.

884
01:12:38,935 --> 01:12:41,071
We gotta high tail
it outta here.

885
01:13:02,025 --> 01:13:05,929
Santa Rio, Santa
Rio, tell these men,

886
01:13:05,962 --> 01:13:08,031
to let this town finally die.

887
01:13:41,464 --> 01:13:43,799
What about those fellas?

888
01:13:46,036 --> 01:13:47,337
To hell with them fellas.

889
01:14:13,296 --> 01:14:15,432
Good morning my
son, can I help you?

890
01:14:15,465 --> 01:14:20,470
Oh yes. My family were
some of the plague victims

891
01:14:21,404 --> 01:14:25,241
down in Malsecco last
year, name's Carson.

892
01:14:27,077 --> 01:14:29,045
There was a rather
large family crypt,

893
01:14:30,613 --> 01:14:33,350
in the most sacred church,
been there for some years.

894
01:14:34,984 --> 01:14:37,387
Crypt contained a number
of family heirloom,

895
01:14:39,923 --> 01:14:43,526
and it seems when the town
was beset by the tragedy

896
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:48,565
your priests retrieved the
precious objects from the church.

897
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:55,605
Well, it was after Father
Thomas's blindness set in,

898
01:14:58,174 --> 01:15:02,112
the church felt that the
town would be exposed

899
01:15:02,145 --> 01:15:07,150
to any element of
transient wickedness.

900
01:15:11,087 --> 01:15:14,057
As you know, Montesecco
is completely abandoned,

901
01:15:16,726 --> 01:15:21,931
and we asked Father Thomas to
join us here but he refused.

902
01:15:24,401 --> 01:15:28,271
Oh, forgive my rudeness
and my poor manners,

903
01:15:28,304 --> 01:15:31,074
I am Father Raymond.

904
01:15:31,107 --> 01:15:32,542
I've seen Father Thomas,

905
01:15:32,575 --> 01:15:36,312
and he still presides
over his church proudly.

906
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:41,217
Now, Father, is it possible
that my family's belongings

907
01:15:41,251 --> 01:15:43,586
might have been transferred
to this location?

908
01:15:45,088 --> 01:15:49,926
It's possible, I can
look at the inventory list.

909
01:15:58,768 --> 01:16:03,940
Yes, yes, it appears as though
we have a blocked strong box

910
01:16:06,342 --> 01:16:10,046
with a Confederate
Army seal on it.

911
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:13,149
Yes, yes. Yes,
that would be it.

912
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:19,656
One of my family members
served with distinction

913
01:16:19,689 --> 01:16:22,625
in the late war
between the States.

914
01:16:22,659 --> 01:16:23,626
Oh yes, I'm sure.

915
01:16:26,362 --> 01:16:30,133
Well, I will retrieve
your box for you, my son.

916
01:16:58,728 --> 01:17:01,664
Well, my son, is
this what you seek?

917
01:17:03,533 --> 01:17:08,538
Lord in heaven, my family's
legacy has been preserved.

918
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:17,514
Oh yes, I'm sure.

919
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:28,191
Ha ha!

920
01:17:28,224 --> 01:17:32,195
For the last two weeks, every
time my leg sings with pain,

921
01:17:32,228 --> 01:17:34,731
I think of you,
you son of a bitch!

922
01:17:42,572 --> 01:17:44,207
I'll refill the canteens,

923
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:47,810
we better get a damn
early start tomorrow.

924
01:17:47,844 --> 01:17:49,045
You best turn in.

925
01:17:51,147 --> 01:17:53,383
There's a good chance
any one of these characters

926
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:55,718
could have beaten
us to this thing.

927
01:17:55,752 --> 01:18:00,723
Well, I wonder you may
be chasing up a dead trail,

928
01:18:03,459 --> 01:18:07,463
just as your pursuit of revenge
was ultimately unsatisfying.

929
01:18:07,497 --> 01:18:09,165
Then why do you stay with me?

930
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:14,537
The Chinese say
that a man or a woman

931
01:18:14,571 --> 01:18:17,473
can sometimes be responsible
for another human being.

932
01:18:19,475 --> 01:18:21,644
Are you responsible for me?

933
01:18:22,545 --> 01:18:24,681
Let's just say I
have a vested interest.

934
01:18:29,752 --> 01:18:31,821
You speak in vagueries.

935
01:18:31,854 --> 01:18:33,222
It's part of my charm.

936
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:04,487
Ransom?

937
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:08,892
Get up here.

938
01:19:08,926 --> 01:19:10,360
Go to hell!

939
01:19:10,393 --> 01:19:11,628
I'm already there, lady.

940
01:19:12,896 --> 01:19:14,297
Before I do this and
search all your belongings,

941
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:15,832
maybe you're gonna
start talking.

942
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:20,169
As far as I'm concerned.
this whole business has gone far enough.

943
01:19:20,203 --> 01:19:21,537
I never wanted any part of this.

944
01:19:23,272 --> 01:19:24,207
The way I figure, you
gotta know something

945
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,342
that you ain't saying.

946
01:19:26,376 --> 01:19:28,244
So you're gonna move that
sweet little ass of yours,

947
01:19:28,277 --> 01:19:29,579
and you're gonna start talking.

948
01:19:39,522 --> 01:19:40,423
Come on.

949
01:19:40,456 --> 01:19:41,724
What in the hell?

950
01:19:41,758 --> 01:19:44,527
Partner, I got
me this filly here,

951
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,430
'cause I'm tired of you always
be behind the eight ball.

952
01:19:48,564 --> 01:19:50,466
So this little bitch
here is gonna talk,

953
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,834
so we can end this chase.

954
01:19:56,472 --> 01:19:58,875
Tiny woman, what do you know?

955
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:06,849
I like me a woman
with enthusiasm.

956
01:20:09,285 --> 01:20:12,288
Now why in the hell
did you involve her?

957
01:20:12,321 --> 01:20:14,824
I always figured she
knew more than she let on.

958
01:20:14,857 --> 01:20:16,927
I think she's just leading
on that man hunter.

959
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,262
Wild Eye, trust me, she knows.

960
01:20:19,295 --> 01:20:20,296
You brick!

961
01:20:24,968 --> 01:20:27,971
All right, if you think you
can get something out of her,

962
01:20:28,005 --> 01:20:30,606
you're welcome to try.

963
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:32,408
I gotta take a piss.

964
01:20:37,346 --> 01:20:40,750
So are you gonna talk? I'm
tired of all this business,

965
01:20:40,783 --> 01:20:42,719
so just talk so we
can put end to this,

966
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,887
so we can be on our way.

967
01:20:46,023 --> 01:20:47,657
What makes you think

968
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:50,860
I'm gonna give you
two any information.

969
01:20:50,894 --> 01:20:53,529
This has nothing to do with you,

970
01:20:53,563 --> 01:20:56,432
you're just a couple
of crazy greasy gnats,

971
01:20:56,466 --> 01:21:00,269
feeding off what aint yours.

972
01:21:00,303 --> 01:21:02,238
It ain't healthy to
give me sass.

973
01:21:07,911 --> 01:21:09,712
You don't scare me!

974
01:21:10,613 --> 01:21:13,984
You and your half blind
partner are nothing.

975
01:21:14,017 --> 01:21:15,886
You know, I have
never met a lady

976
01:21:15,919 --> 01:21:17,420
who didn't find me appealing.

977
01:21:18,588 --> 01:21:20,523
I'd rather swap
spit with a pig.

978
01:21:20,556 --> 01:21:22,893
Well lady, looks like today.

979
01:21:22,926 --> 01:21:25,996
It's your chance to swap
spit with this pig.

980
01:21:27,363 --> 01:21:28,664
Paper romance little lady.

981
01:21:36,806 --> 01:21:37,774
Get the hell off of her.

982
01:21:46,083 --> 01:21:47,650
I oughta kill you right now.

983
01:22:34,597 --> 01:22:37,333
Sometimes, it's just too much.

984
01:22:38,434 --> 01:22:39,102
I know.

985
01:22:58,654 --> 01:23:00,489
You dumb bastard.

986
01:23:03,492 --> 01:23:06,362
I figured a hunch, the
ladies would be your undoing.

987
01:23:16,572 --> 01:23:18,141
Oh, I wouldn't wiggle
around too much if I were you,

988
01:23:18,175 --> 01:23:22,645
that'll make them ropes
tighter, just relax.

989
01:23:22,678 --> 01:23:24,014
I've got plans for you,

990
01:23:24,047 --> 01:23:26,816
similar to the plans
that you had for me.

991
01:23:26,849 --> 01:23:30,686
You see, friend, I knew
where you was headed.

992
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,023
I rode with Scurlock,
he told me everything,

993
01:23:34,523 --> 01:23:37,593
I just hadn't expected
our little fortunate move.

994
01:23:37,627 --> 01:23:39,662
That's where this
gentleman comes in,

995
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:43,166
thank God there's still a saw
bone to that hell hole, huh?

996
01:23:44,968 --> 01:23:47,170
Also a good thing, my
friend here overheard

997
01:23:47,204 --> 01:23:49,039
where them priests
moved everything.

998
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:52,976
Ah, yes, good fortune,

999
01:23:53,010 --> 01:23:55,078
and blessed be our
quick healing paths.

1000
01:23:56,213 --> 01:24:00,918
You do realize, now I'm
gonna have to kill you both.

1001
01:24:02,085 --> 01:24:05,655
Oh my friend, I do not think

1002
01:24:05,688 --> 01:24:07,556
that you will have
that opportunity.

1003
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:10,193
And I told you,
I'm not your friend.

1004
01:24:10,227 --> 01:24:11,161
That's a shame.

1005
01:24:12,896 --> 01:24:14,164
The world would
be a better place

1006
01:24:14,197 --> 01:24:16,632
if everyone was just friends.

1007
01:24:16,666 --> 01:24:20,803
Forgive me that I have
such high moral fiber

1008
01:24:20,836 --> 01:24:24,440
that I did not kill you
when I had the chance.

1009
01:24:48,631 --> 01:24:50,000
Is there something
we can help you with?

1010
01:24:50,033 --> 01:24:52,102
Where in the hell are you
boys going in such a hurry

1011
01:24:52,135 --> 01:24:53,836
and with such an unusual cargo.

1012
01:24:53,869 --> 01:24:55,238
Well, we gotta deliver-

1013
01:24:55,272 --> 01:24:58,574
- No, I'm most interested
in the man you have hogtied

1014
01:24:58,607 --> 01:25:00,210
back here than your pay load.

1015
01:25:00,243 --> 01:25:03,679
I'm Ben Wright, County Marshall
here, and I know this man.

1016
01:25:03,713 --> 01:25:07,017
He's a professional,
he occasionally brings me a fugitive.

1017
01:25:08,818 --> 01:25:10,988
So just what in the
hell are you boys up to?

1018
01:25:13,924 --> 01:25:14,992
He's a wanted man.

1019
01:25:15,025 --> 01:25:16,826
The hell you say.

1020
01:25:16,859 --> 01:25:19,862
Come on, what in the Sam
Hill is going on here?

1021
01:25:48,025 --> 01:25:50,994
I think we wound up with
more than we bargained for.

1022
01:25:54,331 --> 01:25:57,800
Right you are, Sheriff
Danburry from Santa Rio,

1023
01:25:58,868 --> 01:26:01,804
round them all up, we're
taking them in for questioning.

1024
01:26:01,837 --> 01:26:03,073
Throw the bodies in
that.

1025
01:26:10,846 --> 01:26:12,815
I never should have
involved you in this,

1026
01:26:12,848 --> 01:26:15,218
I thought we'd never
get out of there.

1027
01:26:15,252 --> 01:26:17,187
I can't believe that Sheriff
couldn't find anything

1028
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:21,258
to hold that stinker,
he just let him walk.

1029
01:26:21,291 --> 01:26:23,193
Well, you can't
blame that Sheriff,

1030
01:26:24,127 --> 01:26:27,064
would you wanna be under
the same roof as him?

1031
01:26:27,097 --> 01:26:29,832
Again, I never
should've involved you.

1032
01:26:29,865 --> 01:26:31,867
I'm here because I want to be.

1033
01:26:31,902 --> 01:26:34,071
Spoken with true enthusiasm.

1034
01:26:37,374 --> 01:26:39,209
What is it inside
that cash box?

1035
01:26:39,242 --> 01:26:42,279
What else, besides the gold?

1036
01:26:42,312 --> 01:26:45,348
My past, my future, I hope.

1037
01:26:46,816 --> 01:26:48,684
Something I
can't really define.

1038
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:50,987
Well, I reckon.

1039
01:26:52,989 --> 01:26:55,092
The sheriff said he'd
be holding that cash box

1040
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:57,227
pending the judge's ruling,

1041
01:26:57,260 --> 01:27:00,696
which means he might be
planning on turning it in

1042
01:27:00,729 --> 01:27:02,299
to a wartime confiscation.

1043
01:27:04,935 --> 01:27:07,137
Oh, and there's one more thing.

1044
01:27:09,139 --> 01:27:10,240
Yes?

1045
01:27:10,273 --> 01:27:13,709
I've crossed paths with that
dandy of a shootist before.

1046
01:27:15,946 --> 01:27:17,713
How many people
know about this?

1047
01:27:26,755 --> 01:27:30,026
How many times must I relate
my story before it is true?

1048
01:27:31,094 --> 01:27:33,330
I told you, there is a
hearing scheduled for next week,

1049
01:27:33,363 --> 01:27:35,932
if your story checks out,
you'll be free to go.

1050
01:27:35,966 --> 01:27:37,000
And my property?

1051
01:27:37,934 --> 01:27:39,668
Your horses, wagon,
and personal effects

1052
01:27:39,702 --> 01:27:41,204
are in safekeeping.

1053
01:27:41,238 --> 01:27:44,174
You make no mention
of my strong box!

1054
01:27:44,207 --> 01:27:45,741
Yes, well that
will remain here

1055
01:27:45,774 --> 01:27:48,111
until I get a decision
from federal authorities.

1056
01:27:48,145 --> 01:27:49,913
Why is that?
That's my property!

1057
01:27:53,316 --> 01:27:57,454
Listen, Mr. Christie,
I served in the war,

1058
01:27:57,487 --> 01:28:00,723
and I recall the
seal of the old CS of A.

1059
01:28:00,756 --> 01:28:02,425
I know what that box is
and what it was used for,

1060
01:28:02,459 --> 01:28:05,262
this should have been
surrendered to the union in 65.

1061
01:28:06,429 --> 01:28:08,231
You should not try my patience

1062
01:28:08,265 --> 01:28:10,267
any further in this matter, sir.

1063
01:28:11,201 --> 01:28:13,802
Just relax, you have
a week till the hearing.

1064
01:28:15,038 --> 01:28:16,206
Hey, old man.

1065
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,708
What's the status of this man?

1066
01:28:20,944 --> 01:28:23,480
It's really not at
my discretion to opine.

1067
01:28:23,513 --> 01:28:25,382
Well, what the
hell does that mean?

1068
01:28:26,516 --> 01:28:28,051
It means I have
no jurisdiction

1069
01:28:28,084 --> 01:28:29,419
as to the outcome
of this matter.

1070
01:28:29,452 --> 01:28:31,488
The judge will oversee
the proceedings next week.

1071
01:28:31,521 --> 01:28:33,190
Well how about this
proceeding?

1072
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,428
Are you joking?

1073
01:28:38,461 --> 01:28:40,030
Do you have any idea
what you're up against?

1074
01:28:40,063 --> 01:28:41,797
Yes, I do flannel mouth,

1075
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:43,466
your deputy has left town.

1076
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,902
See him leave, now!

1077
01:28:45,936 --> 01:28:50,340
Let me have that strong
box, and open up that cell.

1078
01:28:56,246 --> 01:28:58,248
You realize this
is a capital offense.

1079
01:28:58,281 --> 01:29:03,253
Well, you're absolutely
goddamn right, it is.

1080
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:04,988
Now move it, blatherskite.

1081
01:29:17,133 --> 01:29:20,270
Now you let him come
out, you take his place.

1082
01:29:29,145 --> 01:29:30,914
And hand him the key,

1083
01:29:34,017 --> 01:29:34,850
I'll have you know-

1084
01:29:38,455 --> 01:29:41,291
That's for the inconvenience
you two-bit peckerwood.

1085
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,395
Grab your rig, and
get whatever else,

1086
01:29:45,428 --> 01:29:48,864
I suggest we get ourselves
the hell away from here.

1087
01:29:48,898 --> 01:29:50,866
What about the Telegraph?

1088
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:52,402
Oh, tickety
tack, tickety tack.

1089
01:29:56,006 --> 01:29:58,041
Now can we get out of here?

1090
01:29:58,074 --> 01:30:00,377
I shall offer you my
gratitude on the road.

1091
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:02,012
There'll be time
enough for blabbering,

1092
01:30:02,045 --> 01:30:04,147
when we put some
distance between us

1093
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:06,049
and that man huntering
son of a bitch.

1094
01:30:06,082 --> 01:30:06,950
Hey!

1095
01:30:08,418 --> 01:30:10,553
You'll pay for this.

1096
01:30:11,454 --> 01:30:12,455
Not today!

1097
01:30:30,473 --> 01:30:31,474
Did you see that?

1098
01:30:33,009 --> 01:30:34,477
Where might they go from here?

1099
01:30:35,945 --> 01:30:39,449
My guess is West,
fewer settlements,

1100
01:30:39,482 --> 01:30:42,585
fewer watering
holes, fewer people.

1101
01:30:42,619 --> 01:30:43,586
Then let's go.

1102
01:30:44,621 --> 01:30:46,189
You wanna continue?

1103
01:30:46,222 --> 01:30:47,123
No question.

1104
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:53,363
You know it's liable to
get fairly dicey here on out.

1105
01:30:53,396 --> 01:30:55,999
That dandy is right
dangerous with a pistol.

1106
01:30:57,434 --> 01:30:59,002
I'm not worried.

1107
01:30:59,035 --> 01:30:59,903
Hmm?

1108
01:31:00,904 --> 01:31:01,604
You're with me.

1109
01:31:33,636 --> 01:31:37,540
Oh, that's real nice.

1110
01:31:41,644 --> 01:31:43,046
I'm big Bully Bryant.

1111
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:51,988
That's wonderful,

1112
01:31:53,323 --> 01:31:55,658
you have a very unfriendly
mode of introduction.

1113
01:31:55,692 --> 01:31:57,327
You don't remember me, do you?

1114
01:31:59,295 --> 01:32:03,366
With a face like that,
I should, but I don't.

1115
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,969
I didn't always
look like this.

1116
01:32:06,002 --> 01:32:06,703
And?

1117
01:32:06,736 --> 01:32:09,706
El Paso, three years ago.

1118
01:32:09,739 --> 01:32:10,607
What about it?

1119
01:32:12,108 --> 01:32:14,477
Two slugs from this cannon,

1120
01:32:14,511 --> 01:32:16,012
carved these creases in my face.

1121
01:32:16,045 --> 01:32:17,580
Look at me when I talk to you!

1122
01:32:20,216 --> 01:32:23,153
You ran with Salice Cook.

1123
01:32:23,186 --> 01:32:25,688
You nailed him coming
out of Hogan, Rhyolite,

1124
01:32:25,722 --> 01:32:27,590
a week before you picked me up.

1125
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,662
Your face...

1126
01:32:32,695 --> 01:32:36,299
As I said, two
cartridges from this iron

1127
01:32:36,332 --> 01:32:39,569
Shit, my shooting must
have been off that day.

1128
01:32:41,438 --> 01:32:43,473
You know what it's
like to look like this?

1129
01:32:44,407 --> 01:32:48,278
People turning their
heads, children scared,

1130
01:32:49,779 --> 01:32:52,649
no proper doctor in
that territorial prison.

1131
01:32:52,682 --> 01:32:54,284
Shouldn't you still be there?

1132
01:32:55,652 --> 01:32:58,188
I'm smart, I got out.

1133
01:32:59,055 --> 01:33:01,958
I figured the weakness
and I got out.

1134
01:33:03,393 --> 01:33:04,994
Took a guard with me too,

1135
01:33:06,362 --> 01:33:08,731
and then I paid a visit to
that petty fogging judge.

1136
01:33:10,533 --> 01:33:12,669
He won't sentence
anybody no more.

1137
01:33:15,138 --> 01:33:16,105
Now it's my turn.

1138
01:33:16,806 --> 01:33:18,374
Yup.

1139
01:33:18,408 --> 01:33:21,211
You know, there are a lot
of witnesses around here.

1140
01:33:22,078 --> 01:33:24,447
You think these
chinks and Mormons care?

1141
01:33:25,548 --> 01:33:29,352
Mormons are too busy looking
after all those wives,

1142
01:33:29,385 --> 01:33:31,621
celestials, they know what
happens when you come up

1143
01:33:31,654 --> 01:33:33,590
against a white man.

1144
01:33:33,623 --> 01:33:37,293
Now, I intend to take
my time with you.

1145
01:33:38,728 --> 01:33:41,364
It was years in that hell hole,

1146
01:33:41,397 --> 01:33:42,632
what you did to me.

1147
01:33:44,634 --> 01:33:45,702
How's the thought
of being a cripple

1148
01:33:45,735 --> 01:33:47,504
for the rest of your life?

1149
01:33:47,537 --> 01:33:50,640
What if I staked you to
the ground, Injun style,

1150
01:33:50,673 --> 01:33:53,243
let the buzzards to
pick out your eyes.

1151
01:33:54,644 --> 01:33:58,348
You killers for hire,
you gotta learn,

1152
01:33:58,381 --> 01:34:02,285
you ain't the Lord
almighty, more like Judas

1153
01:34:02,953 --> 01:34:04,721
'cause it's all about the money.

1154
01:34:06,456 --> 01:34:07,790
Ain't it, bounty whore?

1155
01:34:15,732 --> 01:34:18,101
I hate verbose people.

1156
01:34:18,134 --> 01:34:21,137
Thanks, he was a mic bidder.

1157
01:34:21,170 --> 01:34:22,572
I get that from time to time.

1158
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:24,774
Did I do the right thing?

1159
01:34:24,807 --> 01:34:25,675
Oh yeah.

1160
01:34:27,844 --> 01:34:31,781
What about the sheriff
here? He might not like this.

1161
01:34:31,814 --> 01:34:34,117
No sense in bothering him,

1162
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:36,219
those two probably
locked him in his cell.

1163
01:34:37,153 --> 01:34:39,322
We don't have time for
this son of a bitch.

1164
01:34:47,797 --> 01:34:48,665
Whoa.

1165
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,369
What are you doing?
Why are we stopping?

1166
01:34:53,403 --> 01:34:55,039
We've gotta make like lightning.

1167
01:34:56,907 --> 01:34:59,609
That jail cell was
infested with fleas

1168
01:35:00,276 --> 01:35:02,178
and I am a fastidious gentlemen.

1169
01:35:02,211 --> 01:35:04,514
Oh for God's grace.

1170
01:35:05,615 --> 01:35:07,383
Why did you do
all that back there?

1171
01:35:08,886 --> 01:35:11,621
Well, I had a
partner of recent,

1172
01:35:12,555 --> 01:35:16,359
not a very smart fellow,
but he stuck with me.

1173
01:35:18,328 --> 01:35:21,598
I figured if I can work
this up with a dimwit,

1174
01:35:21,631 --> 01:35:24,834
I might as well
make my new partner

1175
01:35:24,867 --> 01:35:26,703
a smart professional
like yourself.

1176
01:35:28,237 --> 01:35:29,472
At least the way I look at it,

1177
01:35:29,505 --> 01:35:32,141
there's enough in that
box for the both of us,

1178
01:35:33,443 --> 01:35:37,246
Being as such I'm not gonna
contest, we'll go 50%.

1179
01:35:40,316 --> 01:35:43,921
Think of it this way,
it's a new partnership

1180
01:35:43,954 --> 01:35:45,154
with money for two.

1181
01:35:48,725 --> 01:35:51,661
There's one thing
you're not considering.

1182
01:35:52,829 --> 01:35:53,696
What's that?

1183
01:35:55,665 --> 01:35:58,568
I did not set out for
this thing with a partner.

1184
01:36:00,303 --> 01:36:04,540
Well, all right, I went
to a lot of trouble for you.

1185
01:36:05,976 --> 01:36:08,411
And I'm grateful for that.

1186
01:36:08,444 --> 01:36:10,680
Fact is, I may not be welcome

1187
01:36:10,713 --> 01:36:13,816
in that peckerwoods
jurisdiction for some time.

1188
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:18,187
Say on that note
for safety sake,

1189
01:36:18,221 --> 01:36:21,925
why don't we divide
the booty now?

1190
01:36:24,794 --> 01:36:28,531
No, we need to put
some distance first

1191
01:36:28,564 --> 01:36:32,535
between ourselves and that
man hunter and his tiny bitch.

1192
01:36:32,568 --> 01:36:37,473
Well besides, that Sheriff
has probably got himself

1193
01:36:37,507 --> 01:36:39,809
sprung from that cage by now.

1194
01:36:42,578 --> 01:36:43,880
Well, get a move on!

1195
01:36:45,281 --> 01:36:47,383
Oh for God's sake, any day now.

1196
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,787
Ya!

1197
01:36:55,725 --> 01:36:59,562
You know, those two
are going to assume

1198
01:36:59,595 --> 01:37:00,763
that we will follow them,

1199
01:37:05,002 --> 01:37:06,502
and this could turn dangerous.

1200
01:37:06,536 --> 01:37:07,737
I am not frightened,

1201
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:10,339
and I certainly do
not wish to turn back.

1202
01:37:13,543 --> 01:37:15,445
You remind me of your mother.

1203
01:37:15,478 --> 01:37:16,980
Tell me, why do you
men have such trouble

1204
01:37:17,014 --> 01:37:19,215
committing to people or things?

1205
01:37:20,483 --> 01:37:22,719
That's a rather
broad condemnation.

1206
01:37:22,752 --> 01:37:25,788
Actually, I've committed to
a number of ideals and causes

1207
01:37:25,822 --> 01:37:26,756
over the years.

1208
01:37:30,359 --> 01:37:32,662
It's with people that
I have a problem.

1209
01:37:32,695 --> 01:37:33,964
That is obvious.

1210
01:37:35,431 --> 01:37:37,366
Haven't you had
enough of wandering?

1211
01:37:38,334 --> 01:37:40,369
Well, sometimes I believe so,

1212
01:37:43,606 --> 01:37:46,009
but it's difficult
to accept something

1213
01:37:46,043 --> 01:37:48,011
that you know nothing about.

1214
01:37:48,045 --> 01:37:49,980
What would that be?

1215
01:37:50,013 --> 01:37:51,247
Peace.

1216
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:54,250
You could have it.

1217
01:37:56,452 --> 01:37:58,521
Can we ever
actually have peace?

1218
01:37:59,555 --> 01:38:00,523
I intend to.

1219
01:38:04,061 --> 01:38:07,597
There you go, sounding
like your mother again.

1220
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:18,541
What is this?

1221
01:38:19,408 --> 01:38:24,413
Oh, it's a remembrance
of an old wound.

1222
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:51,607
Whoa.

1223
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:02,451
You know how to use this?

1224
01:39:02,485 --> 01:39:04,520
Good, you'll find
it more convenient

1225
01:39:04,554 --> 01:39:05,788
than that cannon you carry.

1226
01:39:09,725 --> 01:39:14,363
I have a hunch, they have to
be on this trail somewhere.

1227
01:39:17,466 --> 01:39:19,102
You maybe right,
look over there.

1228
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:23,406
I figured you two would
catch up sooner or later.

1229
01:39:24,874 --> 01:39:26,342
You know why we're here.

1230
01:39:27,911 --> 01:39:31,747
Well, possession
is 90% of the law,

1231
01:39:31,781 --> 01:39:33,583
besides I got myself
a new partner.

1232
01:39:34,517 --> 01:39:36,752
And, where is he?

1233
01:39:36,786 --> 01:39:39,022
Well he's tied
up at the moment,

1234
01:39:39,056 --> 01:39:41,058
so he won't cause us trouble.

1235
01:39:41,091 --> 01:39:43,526
Go on and get off your mounts.

1236
01:39:43,559 --> 01:39:44,861
Why don't you go to hell?

1237
01:39:44,895 --> 01:39:45,761
No.

1238
01:39:47,763 --> 01:39:50,533
I figured you for
a wise ass bitch.

1239
01:39:51,601 --> 01:39:53,703
Get off your mounts.

1240
01:39:53,736 --> 01:39:55,038
Do as he says.

1241
01:40:06,049 --> 01:40:07,050
Guns, please.

1242
01:40:08,118 --> 01:40:09,887
I do not want any accidents.

1243
01:40:19,729 --> 01:40:21,397
I said, guns please!

1244
01:40:25,135 --> 01:40:27,905
You know, it's not wise
to surrender one's weapon.

1245
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:30,640
You get the picture
now, jack ass?

1246
01:40:42,551 --> 01:40:44,087
Move the fuck along.

1247
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:54,697
Ya! Go!

1248
01:41:01,138 --> 01:41:03,040
This will be a
life-changing moment

1249
01:41:03,073 --> 01:41:05,108
that you will live to regret.

1250
01:41:05,142 --> 01:41:07,110
Well, sure.

1251
01:41:08,211 --> 01:41:11,214
Careful now, there's quicksand
all around these parts.

1252
01:41:11,248 --> 01:41:13,150
He's gonna betray us all.

1253
01:41:13,183 --> 01:41:14,985
Here's how we play this;

1254
01:41:16,119 --> 01:41:17,820
I'll leave the
three of you here,

1255
01:41:18,922 --> 01:41:20,456
and take your guns
and the wagon.

1256
01:41:21,624 --> 01:41:23,826
At some point due
west, I'll leave,

1257
01:41:23,859 --> 01:41:26,529
said guns in the
ground, and I disappear.

1258
01:41:27,697 --> 01:41:31,567
Where I will never look upon
the likes of all you again.

1259
01:41:33,869 --> 01:41:34,737
Kill him!

1260
01:41:36,273 --> 01:41:37,107
I've been too far

1261
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:39,608
to let this bush wacker
get the best of me.

1262
01:41:39,642 --> 01:41:44,147
You, sir, are a twitchy,
nervous wild card,

1263
01:41:44,181 --> 01:41:45,781
which is why you're tied.

1264
01:41:47,150 --> 01:41:51,721
Now is the jack of diamonds
and the queen of hearts,

1265
01:41:51,754 --> 01:41:53,522
gonna give me any trouble?

1266
01:41:56,093 --> 01:41:58,761
Good, you two have more sense.

1267
01:42:03,266 --> 01:42:04,800
Is this your man?

1268
01:42:07,304 --> 01:42:10,573
I said, is this your man!

1269
01:42:13,776 --> 01:42:15,644
You just signed
your death warrant.

1270
01:42:21,617 --> 01:42:26,189
Well, no matter who this
whore shares her bed with,

1271
01:42:26,223 --> 01:42:29,326
little sister you're
coming with me.

1272
01:42:29,359 --> 01:42:31,761
I'm taking you as
an insurance policy,

1273
01:42:31,794 --> 01:42:33,562
but you might find
me interesting.

1274
01:42:35,664 --> 01:42:37,901
I'll get you,
bastard, I promise.

1275
01:42:39,069 --> 01:42:41,104
I just saved you
from the wages of sin.

1276
01:42:42,339 --> 01:42:46,343
Money is the root of
all kinds of evil!

1277
01:42:46,376 --> 01:42:50,546
Know that you go forth in this
life with untarnished souls.

1278
01:42:51,547 --> 01:42:55,886
Now I bid you adieu, you'll
find your weapons

1279
01:42:55,919 --> 01:42:57,888
a mile or so down the road,

1280
01:42:57,921 --> 01:43:02,825
after all I am a Christian,
and a man of my word.

1281
01:43:11,902 --> 01:43:12,802
Yeah, right.

1282
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:22,878
Well, don't just
stand there, untie me.

1283
01:43:25,248 --> 01:43:27,217
My hunch is to leave you tied.

1284
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:31,754
Oh, listen, I know we've
been on the opposite sides

1285
01:43:34,057 --> 01:43:35,258
of this thing all along.

1286
01:43:36,759 --> 01:43:39,829
Well, now's the time
to forget all that,

1287
01:43:40,964 --> 01:43:44,800
if we don't, we'll never see
the contents of that box,

1288
01:43:46,836 --> 01:43:49,272
and you'll never see
your woman again.

1289
01:43:49,306 --> 01:43:50,706
She's not my woman.

1290
01:43:52,008 --> 01:43:55,312
Okay, but do you still
wanna see her go off

1291
01:43:55,345 --> 01:43:58,381
with that depraved bastard?

1292
01:43:58,415 --> 01:44:02,152
All right, I will
untie you, but no tricks.

1293
01:44:04,955 --> 01:44:08,724
You are a wild card.

1294
01:44:08,757 --> 01:44:09,993
Aint we all.

1295
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:14,898
Much obliged.

1296
01:44:18,902 --> 01:44:20,270
We need a plan.

1297
01:44:20,303 --> 01:44:22,671
Fine, what do you figure?

1298
01:44:32,082 --> 01:44:34,217
Do you intend to release me?

1299
01:44:34,251 --> 01:44:39,256
Whoa.

1300
01:44:46,329 --> 01:44:48,932
As I said, do yo
intend to release me?

1301
01:44:49,765 --> 01:44:52,202
I have not yet
decided, pretty flower.

1302
01:44:52,235 --> 01:44:54,905
Will you release me
when you drop the guns?

1303
01:44:56,805 --> 01:45:00,876
I'm a man who has needs,

1304
01:45:00,911 --> 01:45:05,916
except my needs are quite
different from other men.

1305
01:45:08,084 --> 01:45:12,721
My tastes run to adventurous
sport with the ladies,

1306
01:45:12,755 --> 01:45:16,759
that is when I allow myself
to consort with your sex.

1307
01:45:19,229 --> 01:45:23,266
You see, I find most women
to be filthy creatures,

1308
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:26,937
little brains, not much to offer

1309
01:45:26,970 --> 01:45:28,238
but carnal comforts.

1310
01:45:31,408 --> 01:45:35,245
After partaking in a woman,
I have little use for her.

1311
01:45:38,114 --> 01:45:43,119
Most of them don't live long
after the act is completed.

1312
01:45:46,122 --> 01:45:48,091
You may be in for a surprise.

1313
01:45:48,124 --> 01:45:50,093
Well, I welcome the challenge.

1314
01:45:50,126 --> 01:45:51,261
You may have misjudged me.

1315
01:45:51,294 --> 01:45:53,363
Did I, pretty flower?

1316
01:46:02,072 --> 01:46:03,073
I think he's dead.

1317
01:46:12,048 --> 01:46:12,916
Yeah.

1318
01:46:21,157 --> 01:46:22,791
Let's get the hell out of here.

1319
01:46:39,409 --> 01:46:42,178
Now it's the time to see
what all the fuss is about.

1320
01:46:52,322 --> 01:46:53,189
Thank you.

1321
01:46:54,324 --> 01:46:56,493
All right, let me in there.

1322
01:47:16,346 --> 01:47:17,914
Whoa!

1323
01:47:35,965 --> 01:47:36,832
Damn!

1324
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:40,470
No one touches anything!

1325
01:47:43,073 --> 01:47:47,843
Little sister, you
have my.

1326
01:47:48,912 --> 01:47:51,614
That derringer may have
knocked the wind out of me,

1327
01:47:52,782 --> 01:47:56,852
but it did not penetrate deep
enough, I've been shot before.

1328
01:47:59,222 --> 01:48:01,057
You'd been better
off to kill me.

1329
01:48:03,326 --> 01:48:07,263
See, after I murder
your man here,

1330
01:48:09,032 --> 01:48:10,866
and possibly Mr One Eye,

1331
01:48:13,636 --> 01:48:15,538
you and I are
gonna have a party.

1332
01:48:18,274 --> 01:48:20,343
There's a great deal
of money in there.

1333
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:25,014
You are so right.

1334
01:49:36,186 --> 01:49:38,354
It was in here all along.

1335
01:49:42,058 --> 01:49:44,127
Maybe your journey
is at an end.

1336
01:49:46,229 --> 01:49:49,065
Maybe.

1337
01:49:49,098 --> 01:49:53,570
Maybe you found that
peace we talked about.

1338
01:49:55,438 --> 01:49:56,973
What about the rest of it?

1339
01:50:01,611 --> 01:50:02,979
I don't care about it,

1340
01:50:03,948 --> 01:50:07,484
whatever's left in here
came from an evil place.

1341
01:50:07,517 --> 01:50:09,719
I am glad of one thing though.

1342
01:50:09,752 --> 01:50:11,287
Yes?

1343
01:50:11,321 --> 01:50:13,990
That I saw you on your
way to that place of peace.

1344
01:50:17,327 --> 01:50:19,662
They say there's wonderful
country in Montana,

1345
01:50:20,530 --> 01:50:21,631
we could go together.

1346
01:50:23,333 --> 01:50:25,301
After all, we make a good team.

1347
01:50:26,536 --> 01:50:30,240
You should start a new
life on your own terms.

1348
01:50:30,273 --> 01:50:33,776
Forget the past,
find a good man,

1349
01:50:33,810 --> 01:50:35,411
settle down, raise a family.

1350
01:50:35,445 --> 01:50:36,779
Well now, aint this touching.

1351
01:50:38,715 --> 01:50:41,551
Now this is little drawing
room romance is over,

1352
01:50:42,685 --> 01:50:44,254
let's get to it.

1353
01:50:44,287 --> 01:50:46,122
I almost forgot about you.

1354
01:50:46,155 --> 01:50:48,091
And what's the
story with my gun.

1355
01:50:49,225 --> 01:50:51,427
I removed all the
percussion caps.

1356
01:50:51,461 --> 01:50:54,564
Are you deaf? I could've
been killed, you bastard.

1357
01:50:54,597 --> 01:50:56,733
You think I trust
you with a loaded gun?

1358
01:50:57,834 --> 01:51:01,137
Well, forget about that.

1359
01:51:01,170 --> 01:51:02,672
What are we gonna do about that?

1360
01:51:03,806 --> 01:51:05,408
Well, I'm glad you asked me.

1361
01:51:15,752 --> 01:51:16,819
What the hell?

1362
01:51:19,455 --> 01:51:20,823
I've had about
enough of the chaos

1363
01:51:20,857 --> 01:51:23,426
this damn box has created.

1364
01:51:23,459 --> 01:51:26,296
You're taking it
for yourself, you pig!

1365
01:51:26,329 --> 01:51:29,632
Nope, I'm letting you
have the whole damn thing.

1366
01:51:31,334 --> 01:51:34,170
No!

1367
01:51:34,203 --> 01:51:36,472
Untie me you bastard.

1368
01:51:36,506 --> 01:51:38,708
Only thing is,
I'd figure out a way

1369
01:51:38,741 --> 01:51:40,109
to get out from
under those ropes

1370
01:51:40,143 --> 01:51:41,878
before the damn thing sinks.

1371
01:51:41,912 --> 01:51:43,079
Untie me!

1372
01:51:45,883 --> 01:51:49,552
I never could stand
quicksand, dirty stuff.

1373
01:51:49,586 --> 01:51:52,188
I swear if you
don't cut these ropes,

1374
01:51:52,221 --> 01:51:55,625
I'll kill you if I ever see you.

1375
01:51:59,228 --> 01:52:03,232
What would life be without
a little challenge, adios.

1376
01:52:11,708 --> 01:52:14,811
I'll be back to see you,
wherever you settle,

1377
01:52:16,212 --> 01:52:19,148
and I will be there
for you forever.

1378
01:52:20,918 --> 01:52:22,619
I almost believe it this time.

1379
01:52:22,652 --> 01:52:23,519
I mean it.

1380
01:52:25,655 --> 01:52:28,524
Despite your wandering
ways, I know that you will be.

1381
01:52:29,459 --> 01:52:32,362
You are the most decent
man I have ever known,

1382
01:52:33,529 --> 01:52:35,264
I love you with all my heart.

1383
01:52:37,935 --> 01:52:39,602
You know something?

1384
01:52:39,636 --> 01:52:41,170
What?

1385
01:52:41,204 --> 01:52:43,573
I think I may be ready
for that place of peace now.

1386
01:52:46,509 --> 01:52:48,144
I may not be far behind you.

1387
01:52:49,512 --> 01:52:50,747
Be strong, young lady.

1388
01:52:52,281 --> 01:52:53,549
I will be back someday.

1389
01:52:54,617 --> 01:52:55,518
I know you will.

1390
01:52:57,587 --> 01:52:59,255
I know you will be.

1391
01:53:42,632 --> 01:53:45,635
I swear to Christ
if I ever find you,

1392
01:53:45,668 --> 01:53:49,305
I'll cut you from ear to
ear you son of a bitch!

1393
01:53:49,338 --> 01:53:53,743
Nobody does this to me, you
double dealing wrangler.

1394
01:53:53,776 --> 01:53:56,713
Nothing in this
world is ever even!

1395
01:54:47,036 --> 01:54:52,036
