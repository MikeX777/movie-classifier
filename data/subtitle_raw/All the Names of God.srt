1
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,625
-Good morning.
-How's it going?

2
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,291
-Good morning, Santi.
-Hi.

3
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,166
How did your night go?

4
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,583
Nothing special. You?

5
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,250
Same.

6
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,875
...the bird flu,
it concerns a worker...

7
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,666
-What'll it be?
-The usual.

8
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:16,958
Did you go to the doctor?

9
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:21,958
And?

10
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,416
It's my nerves.

11
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,916
And my cholesterol is sky-high,
so no tripe or shit like that.

12
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,291
But we have to die of something
and better to do so happily, right?

13
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,125
And fast. The sooner the better.

14
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,416
Sorry.

15
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,000
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

16
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,041
I'm picking up my last fare.
I'll call you later.

17
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,791
-That's 30 euros.
-I'll pay with my phone, okay?

18
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:58,916
Okay.

19
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,416
-Okay. Do you want a copy?
-No, thanks.

20
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,125
-Have a good trip.
-Thanks!

21
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,750
-Hi.
-Hi.

22
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,041
How's your night going?

23
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,916
Fine. Like always.

24
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,708
Are you coming home now?

25
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:40,083
Yes. I'm close by, actually.
I'm at the airport.

26
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:41,875
Okay.

27
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,250
Want me to make something?

28
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,375
No, it's okay. I already had breakfast.

29
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,416
Okay.

30
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:52,625
I was thinking, if you want,

31
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,791
we could go somewhere for lunch today...

32
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:01,958
Just to get out.

33
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,375
Sure, if you want to.

34
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,708
Do you want to or not?

35
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,250
Sure, it's all the same to me.
Whatever you want.

36
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,375
Okay, we'll see later.

37
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,583
All right.

38
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,333
Christ.

39
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,166
Oh, my God.

40
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,375
Oh, my God.

41
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,166
Come over here.

42
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,791
Please.

43
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:40,958
Hold on to me.

44
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,791
My taxi’s right here.
I'll take you in my taxi, don't worry.

45
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,333
Careful.

46
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,291
Careful.

47
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,791
Don't worry, don't worry, kid.
I'll take you to the hospital.

48
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,958
Here. Have some water.

49
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:22,416
-Raúl! Wake up! Get dressed.
-What's going on?

50
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,333
There was an attack. I'm calling Dad

51
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,875
-but he won't pick up.
-What?

52
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:26,958
Mom!

53
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,958
There were two powerful explosions...

54
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,750
Mom, what are you doing? What happened?

55
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:35,833
I don't know.

56
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,875
There was an explosion at the airport.

57
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,333
-Your dad was there.
-He was?

58
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,791
Yeah, I just talked to him,
I just talked to him.

59
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:42,958
Before the explosion?

60
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,291
Two explosions
in the terminal between...

61
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,625
Ramón's on his way over.
Let’s go find him.

62
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,458
Don't worry. Don't worry,
we're going to the hospital.

63
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,083
Get me out of here. Now.

64
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,583
Get me out of here.
Get me out of the city.

65
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:21,666
Don't look at me!

66
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,208
I said don't look at me.

67
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,416
Don't look at me and drive. Let's go.

68
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,208
It's my wife. No, no, no,
please, let me answer...

69
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,875
Give me the other phone.
The other phone. Now.

70
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,750
Go. Get me out of here.

71
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,916
-Relax.
-Get me out and don't look at me.

72
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:56,041
Not a word, not one.
I said to get me out of here.

73
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,916
I can't move, I can't move,
I can't move.

74
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,833
Go, go, go.

75
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,833
Go.

76
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,833
Go straight, go straight, go straight.

77
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,916
One has failed.
And the remote detonator doesn't work.

78
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,458
The phone must have gotten
damaged in the other explosions.

79
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,416
Dammit.

80
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,583
Selma,

81
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,333
when you hear this message,
I will no longer be in this life.

82
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,750
I am going to Paradise.

83
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,916
The Adolfo Suárez Airport
has four terminals.

84
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,208
The international terminal...

85
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,500
It can't be...

86
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,208
What's wrong, Selma?

87
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,916
Honey, what's wrong?

88
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,458
Hamza's dead.

89
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,083
What about Hamza?

90
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,625
There, we will be happy forever.

91
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,666
God willing.

92
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,208
Allah is the greatest.

93
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,583
Mama...

94
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,833
We have to go to the police.

95
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,916
-Mama...
-I said no!

96
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,041
You really think they won't discover
he is one of them?

97
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,583
If we don't cooperate,
we'll be in trouble.

98
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,041
We have done nothing wrong.

99
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,041
And your brother...

100
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,208
Hamza is no killer.

101
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,000
He was tricked...

102
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,166
He is not a killer.

103
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,958
-My son is not a killer!
-It's okay, Mama.

104
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,500
-The car skipped the checkpoint.
-Stop!

105
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,375
You can't be here.
Turn around immediately.

106
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,958
We're looking for someone.

107
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,041
Evacuate the area immediately.

108
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,250
-Go. Don't enter.
-Please.

109
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,875
-Evacuate the area immediately.
-Please, my husband is here.

110
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,583
Ma’am, please. It's very dangerous.
You can't be here.

111
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,500
Everyone was evacuated,
go to the hospitals.

112
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,500
-Wait, my dad's a taxi driver...
-Leave now!

113
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,708
-I heard you...
-If you heard me, then evacuate.

114
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,125
-Yeah, we're leaving, sorry.
-Come on. Let's go, leave.

115
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,250
Let's go...

116
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:08,166
His car's not here.
He's not here. Come on, get in.

117
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,375
Where are we going?

118
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,375
Where's the GPS?

119
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,625
-What?
-Are you deaf? Where's the GPS?

120
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,125
In... In the glove box.

121
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,458
How are you doing?

122
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,166
We finally have a signal.

123
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:43,958
Santi, it's Ramón.

124
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,083
Do you copy?

125
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,041
-Santi...
-Shut that off.

126
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,958
There's been an attack.
We're looking for you. Do you copy?

127
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,625
-Where is it?
-Over here, Commander. I'll show you.

128
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:28,916
Good morning.

129
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,291
Sorry I'm late, getting here was hell.

130
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,291
-Is Gerardo here yet?
-No, but he should be shortly.

131
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,166
-What about the tapes?
-On their way.

132
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,625
-Heck of a start you've had.
-Yes. A real triumph.

133
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,375
This has been a monumental fuck-up.

134
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,916
Sorry for the delay,
downtown is in chaos.

135
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
No problem.

136
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,500
Pilar just got here too.

137
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,083
We'd better identify these assholes
as soon as possible.

138
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,958
-A few heads are going to roll today.
-As they should.

139
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,791
This isn't the army.
Things are quite different here.

140
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,458
I'm here to do my job.

141
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,083
I'll be aiming at you the whole time.

142
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:53,958
Okay...

143
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,875
Try pulling anything and I'll shoot you
and anyone else I need to.

144
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,083
Don't worry.

145
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,666
I won't do anything stupid.

146
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:13,875
Get out of the taxi.

147
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,958
Grab the pliers and the screwdriver.

148
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,708
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

149
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,500
18.70, please.

150
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:43,666
Sit there.

151
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,875
Hands on your head.

152
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,166
Stay still.

153
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:02,833
Get out.

154
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,333
We've got them.

155
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,291
Three. There are three.

156
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,000
Yes, 20 years old or so.

157
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,500
All right.

158
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,875
But there were two explosions,
not three.

159
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,916
The third explosion could have failed.

160
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,333
Or he backed out and he's still alive.

161
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,958
Yeah, let's hope not.

162
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,791
It must be this way.

163
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,208
Excuse me, where’s the person in charge?

164
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,250
-I don't know.
-Thank you.

165
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,375
Excuse me,
the person in charge of this floor?

166
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,500
Over there.

167
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:24,000
We're looking
for a victim of the attack,

168
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,875
-could you help us, please?
-Full name?

169
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:28,250
-Sa...
-Santiago Gómez Lasarte.

170
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:29,708
-Okay...
-Lasarte.

171
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,041
Santiago Gómez Lasarte...

172
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,041
He's not here.

173
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,250
Check Isabel Zendal Hospital
or the forensics department.

174
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,958
Don't worry, we're going to find him.

175
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,041
Okay?

176
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,500
All right, let's go, Raúl.

177
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,708
These images
captured by the security cameras

178
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:54,083
show the three terrorists
moments before the attack.

179
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,916
Driss Manzur, age 20,

180
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,333
Malik Jalaf, age 18,
and Hamza Chait, age 19.

181
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:06,666
All of them are Spanish residents
originally from Morocco.

182
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,875
So far, it is not known

183
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:10,875
if they have a history
linked to jihadist terrorism.

184
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:15,125
-Minister, do you have them?
-I have them in front of me.

185
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,333
What do we know about them?

186
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:20,375
We know that none of them have a record.

187
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,208
We also have
their social media profiles,

188
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,916
which are clearly fake.

189
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,333
They made them two years ago,

190
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,375
when Kadar Abadi was still free,

191
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:30,541
so there's a lot of evidence
pointing in his direction.

192
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,166
I asked that he be brought here
for interrogation.

193
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,833
Understood. How is the search
in the hospitals going?

194
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,500
Minister, we're working on it.

195
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,750
But at the moment, none of them appear

196
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,083
to have been wounded or unconscious.

197
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,958
Okay, thank you, everyone.

198
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,791
Please keep me updated.

199
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:47,458
Thank you.

200
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:19,875
Give me the keys.

201
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,083
Stay still.

202
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,000
Hands on the wheel.

203
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,000
Do you recognize them?

204
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,791
No.

205
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,291
Kadar, give me a name.

206
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:19,958
Just one name and your life in prison
will be much easier.

207
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:24,291
You know as well as I do
that we all use fake names.

208
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,125
No one knows who anyone really is.

209
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:31,833
So when you catch us,
all you have is one thing...

210
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:34,875
Nothing.

211
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:38,583
What about you, Kadar? What do you have?

212
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:44,541
A fucking isolation cell
where you'll spend your whole life

213
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:47,291
trying to convince yourself
that it was worth it.

214
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,250
But deep down,
you know that no one cares about you.

215
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:54,833
Your bosses are free,
living their best fucking lives,

216
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,250
tricking someone just like you
to do their dirty work.

217
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,958
Hell on Earth.

218
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:05,416
That's what you have.

219
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:09,750
Think about it.

220
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:12,625
Just one name.

221
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:38,250
Stop! Military Police!

222
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:39,375
Military Police!

223
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:42,958
-Stop!
-Go, go!

224
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,333
Military Police!

225
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,750
Stop!

226
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,833
Stop there! Don't move!

227
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,291
Stop!

228
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:08,958
Stop!

229
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,541
Military Police! Hands up!

230
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:17,875
Hands up!
Turn around, turn around!

231
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:19,125
Turn around!

232
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:41,041
Where is he?

233
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,250
Why the hell
isn't he answering his phone?

234
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:50,750
Hey, Laura, do you have access
to Santi's GPS application?

235
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:52,750
-Yeah.
-The GPS?

236
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,333
-Yeah, yeah, I do.
-Open it.

237
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:00,750
Here.

238
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:06,791
-Nothing.
-What?

239
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:09,708
It lost signal over an hour ago. Look.

240
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:11,291
-Let me see.
-There.

241
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:13,791
That's Somosierra.

242
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,708
-Somosierra?
-Yes.

243
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,666
Hey...

244
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:32,958
I have to pee, please.

245
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:37,666
Please.

246
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:32,875
Get in the car.

247
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:35,708
Now what?

248
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,916
I don't know.

249
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,083
Whatever I do, I'm fucked.

250
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:51,458
It doesn't have to be like that.

251
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:55,666
The police will protect you.
You're important for them.

252
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:00,166
Until they get what they need.

253
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,333
Why didn't you press the detonator?

254
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,000
Because I'm a coward.

255
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:41,375
They said, before we die,

256
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:44,125
you see the face of Allah.

257
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:18,916
But I could only see my mother's face.

258
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,166
Maybe it's best
if you turned yourself in.

259
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:58,916
They aren't moving.

260
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:02,958
What do we do?

261
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:05,333
We found him.

262
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,291
Let's get him.

263
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,000
-Let me see the GPS.
-Here it is.

264
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:57,250
Here it is. Here's the gas station.

265
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:07,125
See if the car's in the parking lot.

266
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,375
I'll ask inside.

267
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:21,250
It's not here.

268
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,625
Have you seen a taxi driver here
in the past couple hours?

269
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:28,333
I don't know. I just started my shift.

270
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:31,333
Is there anyone from the other shift
that can give me a hand?

271
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:33,916
I'm sorry, my coworker's already left.

272
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:37,666
Look.

273
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:41,458
What is that?

274
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:49,958
Holy shit.

275
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:04,291
This is Santi's, no doubt about it.
We have to call the police.

276
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,666
-They aren't going to do anything.
-Why not?

277
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:12,000
-He's an adult, Ramón.
-So?

278
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,583
Without evidence
that something's happened,

279
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:15,916
they won't look for him.

280
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,208
Not with everything going on.

281
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:20,125
But we have to report this.

282
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,375
He clearly doesn't want to be found.

283
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,458
Raúl, no.

284
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,833
Your dad would never disappear
and leave you like this.

285
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,791
Okay?

286
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:40,666
All right...

287
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:45,500
He's right, honey. He's right.

288
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,833
The taxi driver
is Santiago Gómez Lasarte.

289
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:01,583
These are
the gas station's security cameras,

290
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:03,875
where the family reported
his disappearance.

291
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:07,458
The GPS loses signal
at that same service station.

292
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,916
Without a signal,
this is going to be complicated.

293
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,333
Yes, that's Hamza Chait.

294
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,083
It seems
he took the taxi driver hostage.

295
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,250
Locate Hamza Chait's family.

296
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:30,583
We haven't heard from Hamza
in almost a year.

297
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,375
We know he was in Syria

298
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:34,500
from October to December last year.

299
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:37,208
Most likely receiving military training.

300
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:41,000
That's when he disappeared.

301
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,458
Did you notice
anything strange before he left?

302
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:47,208
Yes, but...

303
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,333
we'd never imagined something like this.

304
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:54,000
What did you notice?
When did he start acting different?

305
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:58,083
It was...

306
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:02,041
after coming back
from his last vacation in Morocco.

307
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:06,750
He started going to the mosque every day

308
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:08,250
when he'd never gone before.

309
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:13,583
He made me start wearing a hijab
when I never used to wear one.

310
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:16,666
My son wanted to be a good Muslim.

311
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,958
But they tricked him.

312
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:29,291
Good Muslims don't do what he did.

313
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,750
What's going on?

314
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:41,750
We think Hamza is still alive.

315
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,916
And he might possibly
get in touch with you.

316
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:50,833
If he does,
it's important that you tell us

317
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:52,375
so we can help him.

318
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,958
Thank God.

319
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:59,833
Thank God. Thank God.

320
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:06,416
God's wrath will fall upon you.

321
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,416
Come on, let's go.

322
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:23,916
Get out.

323
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:26,375
Let's go.

324
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:28,041
-Come on.
-Let's go.

325
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,166
Move.

326
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:33,750
Khaled Saidi. For the past two months,
he shared an apartment

327
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,416
with the two suicide terrorists,

328
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,333
Manzur and Jalaf.

329
00:40:37,416 --> 00:40:39,125
They met in an internet café,

330
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:41,375
and though it's too early
to rule anything out,

331
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:42,583
it appears he didn't know

332
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:44,583
his roommates' intentions.

333
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,500
We're also interrogating
their families in Morocco,

334
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:48,958
but we don't have anything so far.

335
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:50,458
We have to go public

336
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:52,958
so that bastard
doesn't have anywhere to hide.

337
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:54,625
If we make it public,

338
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:56,750
we put the taxi driver's life in danger.

339
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,291
His life is already in danger.

340
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,958
If Chait hasn't killed him yet,

341
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,708
he plans to use him as a shield.

342
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:03,750
In any event, we shouldn't forget

343
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:05,500
what our priority is.

344
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:07,000
We need to find Hamza Chait alive.

345
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:09,125
Let's wait until dawn.

346
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:10,333
Why, Pilar?

347
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:12,291
Chait doesn't know
we're looking for him.

348
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,416
He's probably feeling confident

349
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,666
and he'll make a mistake.

350
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,166
It's only been five hours
since the attack,

351
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,166
the coming hours are crucial.

352
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,291
I agree.

353
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:26,791
Agreed.

354
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,291
Until dawn,
but not a single hour longer.

355
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:32,166
We have to notify the driver's family.

356
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,875
If you don't mind,
I'd like to speak with them myself.

357
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:36,000
Of course.

358
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:36,833
Papa wanted these to be yours.

359
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:41,041
Do you know what all the beads are?

360
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,500
There are 99.

361
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:49,250
One for every name of God.

362
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:56,708
-The first name is Allah.
-Allah. (God)

363
00:42:57,791 --> 00:42:59,541
The second is Ar-Rajman.

364
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:01,166
Ar-Rajman. (The Merciful)

365
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:04,166
Ad-Dar... (The Causer of Harm)

366
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,416
Al-Qawiyy... (The Strong One)

367
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:11,250
-Al-Hamid...
-Al-Hamid. (The Praiseworthy)

368
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:13,625
Al-Mumit... (The Bringer of Death)

369
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,083
-Al-Muntaquim...
-Al-Muntaquim... (The Avenger)

370
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:20,750
-Al-Muhyee...
-Al Muhyee. (The Giver of Life)

371
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:23,625
-Al-Kabeer.
-Al-Kabeer. (The Greatest)

372
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,375
-As-Salam.
-As-Salam. (The Giver of Peace)

373
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:46,208
Hey.

374
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:49,916
Hey, kid. Hey.

375
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:19,750
Come on, kid.
Come on, kid. Come on, kid.

376
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,291
Hey, hey.

377
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:33,500
Can you sit up?

378
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:39,000
Do you think you can walk?

379
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:43,333
-Don't leave me alone.
-No.

380
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,083
Shit...

381
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:46,500
Shit.

382
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,041
Hang on.

383
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,750
Several witnesses say

384
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,583
the terrorists detonated their vests

385
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:29,333
at the check-in desks

386
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:31,041
for the airlines,

387
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:34,083
a very busy area
at the time of the attack...

388
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:42,875
Happy birthday

389
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:48,666
to you.

390
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,666
There you go!

391
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:54,500
Okay, a few words. It's a family video.

392
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:01,166
There. That's it.

393
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:08,416
Such coordination, such coordination.

394
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:12,000
I'm going to fall out. Hey, hey, hey!

395
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:13,125
Hey, sis.

396
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,875
How's my sister today?

397
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:21,500
I'm making you
a lovely collection of videos.

398
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:23,500
No, leave me alone.

399
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:24,583
No, I can't.

400
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:26,291
I want to make a collection of videos

401
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:28,333
of you becoming a titan.

402
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:30,166
A titan... What for?

403
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:32,416
Because you'll get better.

404
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:36,250
Well...

405
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:52,125
Hello?

406
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,416
Yes, this is she.

407
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:58,791
These images were captured
an hour after the attack.

408
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,541
The man with him is the third terrorist

409
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:03,916
that didn't detonate
his bomb at the airport.

410
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:07,833
We think
he has taken your husband hostage.

411
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:09,791
But we won't stop until we find him.

412
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:15,166
What can we do?

413
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,458
Stay here until we find him.

414
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:23,083
It'll be quiet in here.

415
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:26,375
We'll let you know if we hear anything.

416
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:28,833
Thank you.

417
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:58,416
Hey.

418
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:00,208
It's okay, Mom.

419
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:02,208
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

420
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:04,833
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

421
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:08,958
It's okay.

422
00:49:23,416 --> 00:49:25,458
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
ARE FUCKING GARBAGE

423
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:29,958
IS YOUR BROTHER REALLY ONE
OF THE GUYS FROM THE ATTACK?

424
00:50:06,416 --> 00:50:07,875
Will you talk to my mother?

425
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:26,375
Relax.

426
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:28,250
Okay?

427
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:31,458
I won't have to. You'll make it.

428
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:40,416
I don't think so.

429
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:00,958
Give this to her for me.

430
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:05,500
Don't be silly.

431
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:06,583
-Please.
-Don't be silly.

432
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:08,958
-Please...
-Give it to her yourself.

433
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,583
Please.

434
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,333
My oldest child's name was Mónica.

435
00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:33,250
She died a year and a half ago.

436
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:35,833
Of cancer.

437
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:43,458
No one deserves to lose a child.

438
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:45,208
No one.

439
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:56,875
Relax.

440
00:51:58,833 --> 00:51:59,875
Okay?

441
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:03,208
Relax.

442
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:24,958
There, we will be happy forever.

443
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,291
God willing.

444
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:37,875
Allah is the greatest.

445
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:51,958
Hamza.

446
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:53,625
Hey! Hey!

447
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:55,750
Here, over here! Please.

448
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:01,333
Hey.

449
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:02,916
Over here, help.

450
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,416
We had an accident, please.

451
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:53,875
How life twists and turns, eh, Santiago?

452
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,000
Now you will finish
what that coward Hamza

453
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:58,125
could not.

454
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:00,041
What?

455
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:01,875
Listen carefully.

456
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:03,250
When this call is over,

457
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:05,916
the bomb
you are wearing will be activated.

458
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:10,125
It works
with very sensitive motion sensors.

459
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:13,250
That means that
in order for it not to explode,

460
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:14,375
you must walk.

461
00:55:15,083 --> 00:55:16,958
If you stop, you will die.

462
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:19,875
-But what...?
-And don't try any tricks.

463
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:21,625
You have to walk.

464
00:55:22,916 --> 00:55:26,625
Why are you doing this to me?
Why are you doing this?

465
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:27,958
I haven't done anything!

466
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:31,208
A picture is worth a thousand words.

467
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:34,125
And yours will be seen around the world.

468
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,250
Hey!

469
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:20,958
Please... Please, I need help.

470
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:24,208
Please, help me. I need help.

471
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:26,083
Please, listen... Listen to me.

472
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:29,666
Listen to me! Help, please.

473
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:33,083
Please, call the police.

474
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:36,416
Security!

475
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:37,875
Yes, here.

476
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:40,041
Please, you have to call my boss.
-Freeze!

477
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:42,333
Freeze!
-I can't, I can't stop moving!

478
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:44,791
If I stop, it explodes.
I can't stop, it'll explode.

479
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:46,125
Please, listen to me.

480
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:50,666
Listen to me!

481
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:54,208
You have to call the police.
Call the police.

482
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:56,166
Evacuate the building!

483
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:02,333
Evacuate the building!

484
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:18,666
Go, go, go.

485
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:21,041
Come on, come on.

486
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:22,416
Please, don't stop.

487
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,416
Come on, come on, come on.

488
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,583
Go, go.

489
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:33,708
-Good morning, Captain.
-How's it going?

490
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:35,000
Almost ready.

491
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:37,166
Let's go! Let's go, let's go!

492
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:40,708
Come on...

493
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:52,000
-Hello.
-Commander.

494
00:57:52,458 --> 00:57:53,916
This is everything we have.

495
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:06,958
Stop!

496
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,958
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

497
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:11,333
Please, I can't stop, I can't stop.

498
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:13,708
They said if I stop,
the bomb will explode.

499
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:17,291
I'm going to throw you
a radio so we can talk, okay?

500
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:18,416
Okay?

501
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:39,583
Okay, I'm going to see

502
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:41,458
what kind of explosive it is, okay?

503
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:44,458
-While I walk?
-Yes. Don't worry.

504
00:58:45,916 --> 00:58:48,041
My name is Jesús. What's your name?

505
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,291
Santiago Gómez Lasarte.

506
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:51,666
Very good. Keep walking.

507
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:55,541
-Yes?
-I'm Pilar Montero,

508
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:56,958
Military police commander.

509
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,750
We're very sorry about your situation.

510
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:02,541
We are doing our best to find a solution

511
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:04,500
-as soon as possible.
-Raise your arm.

512
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,250
-Raise your arm.
-Tell me what happened.

513
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:09,000
Hey... Hey, I need
to talk to my family, please.

514
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,750
You have to contact them.

515
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:13,791
Don't worry, they're with us.
Now I need you to tell me what happened.

516
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:17,416
Well... I don't exactly know.

517
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,875
I picked up
one of the terrorists at the airport

518
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:22,041
thinking he was a victim

519
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,208
and he kidnapped me.

520
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:26,708
Then we got in an accident
and some men appeared

521
00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:28,916
and they shot Hamza.

522
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,291
-Keep walking.
-And they knocked me out.

523
00:59:33,375 --> 00:59:34,375
And...

524
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:36,750
That's all I remember. I woke up

525
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:38,666
in the bathroom
with this explosive vest on.

526
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:42,250
And they...

527
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:46,083
They called me on a phone and said...

528
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,833
-Hamza Chait is dead?
-Yes...

529
00:59:50,916 --> 00:59:51,958
Yes, he's dead.

530
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:57,083
Tell me

531
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:59,250
exactly what they told you
during that phone call.

532
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:02,333
They said... that the vest

533
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:04,083
has motion sensors

534
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:06,833
and if I stop walking, it will explode.

535
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:11,625
Santiago, don't worry,
we're here to help.

536
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,083
We won't let that happen.

537
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:15,083
Now please give the phone

538
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:17,875
that the terrorists gave you
to Jesús. Thank you.

539
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,250
Keep going. Keep walking.

540
01:00:30,916 --> 01:00:32,166
Keep walking, don't stop.

541
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:33,875
Keep walking.

542
01:00:35,625 --> 01:00:36,666
Go.

543
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:29,166
Thanks.

544
01:01:33,416 --> 01:01:35,708
Sorry, the number
you dialed does not exist.

545
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:37,958
Of course.

546
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:40,291
The Islamic State, also known as Daesh,

547
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:42,250
previously attacked Spain

548
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:44,375
in the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils

549
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:47,833
on the afternoon of August 17th, 2017.

550
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:49,541
On that occasion, there were 16...

551
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:52,875
The three terrorists had been residing
in Spain for several years

552
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:56,833
and officials weren't concerned
about their ties to the Islamic State.

553
01:01:56,916 --> 01:01:59,750
They do not seem to have been looking
for licensed lawyers either.

554
01:01:59,833 --> 01:02:04,958
This suggests that, once again, it'd be
a terrorist cell coming from Paris...

555
01:02:05,041 --> 01:02:08,041
The explosive
seems to be TATP, 22 units.

556
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:10,375
And there are three locks on the opening

557
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:11,500
on the back.

558
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:14,750
It has a built-in timer
with a phone underneath,

559
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:16,250
so it's very likely

560
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:17,791
they can trigger the vest remotely

561
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:19,750
and the motion sensors
seem to be connected

562
01:02:19,833 --> 01:02:21,875
to a red flashing light.

563
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:24,250
It's impossible
to deactivate here now, right?

564
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:26,875
If the hostage was immobile,
it'd be risky but viable.

565
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:29,416
But in these conditions,
I'd say it's impossible.

566
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:31,500
So what options do we have?

567
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:33,500
To reduce the consequences

568
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,083
of an explosion as much as possible,

569
01:02:35,166 --> 01:02:36,875
we should move him to a clear area

570
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:38,375
and, once there, remove the vest

571
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:40,333
on a surface we can control.

572
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:42,291
Like a treadmill, for example.

573
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:44,625
-Does the vest have GPS?
-Probably not.

574
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:46,791
Where is the nearest safe area?

575
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:48,708
This industrial zone is ideal.

576
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:51,583
It's secure enough
to direct the convoy there.

577
01:02:51,666 --> 01:02:53,750
Commander,
I'd take him there without a doubt.

578
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:55,875
-How far is it from here?
-About 10 kilometers.

579
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:57,083
There's no time for that.

580
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:59,208
They can set off the vest at any time

581
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:01,416
and if we don't want any more deaths

582
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,916
or severe injuries,

583
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:07,083
we have to trigger
a controlled explosion.

584
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:09,041
Yes, it has to be right here.

585
01:03:09,125 --> 01:03:10,291
The area is clear

586
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:12,125
and the media doesn't know anything yet.

587
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:13,875
We can't sentence that man to death

588
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:16,208
without weighing all our options.

589
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:18,875
Fine, what options
do we have? What options?

590
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:22,250
Make no mistake, Pilar,
we aren't the ones

591
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:23,833
that sentenced him to death.

592
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:28,750
INCOMING CALL
PRIVATE NUMBER

593
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:35,791
Am I speaking to Pilar? Pilar Montero?

594
01:03:36,791 --> 01:03:37,958
Yes, this is she.

595
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,166
What are you playing at, Pilar?

596
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,458
I thought you were a woman of action.

597
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:49,166
It's 700 steps to Gran Vía.

598
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:54,208
If Santiago isn't there in five minutes
for the whole world to see live,

599
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,166
we'll activate the vest.

600
01:04:01,875 --> 01:04:03,041
Fuck.

601
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:08,833
We can't let them get their way.

602
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:10,500
It's my decision.

603
01:04:11,166 --> 01:04:13,000
And a controlled explosion
isn't an option.

604
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,416
We'll see about that.

605
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,958
We cannot allow the image

606
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:34,583
of a civilian
walking through the center of Madrid

607
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:37,125
with a bomb that can go off
at any moment, Pilar.

608
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:40,208
Don't forget we're setting
a very dangerous precedent

609
01:04:40,291 --> 01:04:42,125
giving in to what the terrorists want.

610
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:44,083
It is equally dangerous for us

611
01:04:44,166 --> 01:04:46,250
to sacrifice a civilian
behind closed doors.

612
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:51,625
We know full well they have images
of Santiago in the vest in the bathroom,

613
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:53,416
so even if we wanted to hide this,

614
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,916
they'd release those
and accuse us of his death.

615
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:01,916
I'm aware of all that this entails.

616
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:04,625
But if we can't keep
that man from dying,

617
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:07,791
we must at least make it clear
that we did all we could to save him.

618
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:13,583
Go ahead, Commander.

619
01:05:16,708 --> 01:05:19,958
-Captain, go ahead.
-We'll continue the operation.

620
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:32,000
Santiago, this is Pilar again.

621
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:35,958
-Hello.
-We'll be in constant contact

622
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:37,208
through this device.

623
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I appreciate that,

624
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:41,708
but do you think I have a chance
of surviving this?

625
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:44,791
Do you think we'd set all this up
if you didn't?

626
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:49,166
May I please ask a favor?

627
01:06:49,583 --> 01:06:50,708
Anything.

628
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:53,791
And no need to be polite...
I think the occasion warrants it.

629
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:56,750
I need to talk to my wife.

630
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:06,458
-What?
-We've found Santiago.

631
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:07,916
-Great...
-Is he okay?

632
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:09,583
-Is... Is he okay?
-Where?

633
01:07:09,666 --> 01:07:11,041
-He's with us...
-Where?

634
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,625
And he wants to talk to you.

635
01:07:18,291 --> 01:07:19,583
Santi?

636
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:22,375
-Santi, can you hear me?
-Laura?

637
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:26,875
-Hello, my love. Hello, my love.
-Laura, can you hear me? Are you okay?

638
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:28,625
We're fine, how are you?

639
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:29,875
-Where is he?
-How are you?

640
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:32,875
Fine, fine, fine.
Okay, listen to me, Laura.

641
01:07:32,958 --> 01:07:34,916
-You have to stay calm, okay?
-Where...?

642
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,333
Listen, where are you?
We'll come get you, okay?

643
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:41,166
Laura, you have to... You can't come.
You have to stay calm, okay?

644
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,750
Sa... Santi, what is it?
Why can't we go?

645
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:45,416
-Can I have the phone?
-What is it?

646
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,208
Please give the phone back. Please.

647
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:49,083
-What is it, Santi?
-Laura...

648
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:50,958
-It's under control, all right?
-Laura!

649
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:53,958
You have to stay calm.
It's all under control.

650
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,708
All right?

651
01:07:56,291 --> 01:07:57,416
Calm down.

652
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:01,375
-Let's see...
-What is it?

653
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:02,583
Let's see.

654
01:08:12,708 --> 01:08:16,000
"As you can see,
there's significant police presence

655
01:08:16,083 --> 01:08:17,750
and the reason is this:

656
01:08:17,833 --> 01:08:20,291
the Military police is escorting a man

657
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:22,833
with an explosive vest
attached to his chest.

658
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:26,041
The Military police tells us
he is not a terrorist,

659
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:28,625
and all we know about the man
is he's Spanish.

660
01:08:29,041 --> 01:08:30,958
That's all the information we have.

661
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:33,208
Neither I nor my media colleagues

662
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:35,708
have received
any additional information.

663
01:08:36,166 --> 01:08:38,875
But we'll do all we can
to try to find out

664
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:42,666
what's going on and inform our audience
as they deserve."

665
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:58,958
We're going over
all the operations with explosives

666
01:08:59,041 --> 01:09:01,041
-in Iraq and Afghanistan.
-All right.

667
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:03,625
Pilar, this is a mistake.

668
01:09:05,083 --> 01:09:06,125
Director?

669
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:09,833
Interior command is furious, Pilar,
they want to know the plan. Now.

670
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:12,083
We're working on it.

671
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:19,375
I'll be right back.

672
01:09:59,958 --> 01:10:03,125
We'll trick them and take Santiago
without them realizing it.

673
01:10:03,208 --> 01:10:05,791
-Trick them how?
-By rigging the footage.

674
01:10:05,916 --> 01:10:08,916
Making them think it's live
when it's really not.

675
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,041
It's the tactic used by the terrorists

676
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:12,875
that attacked us in Afghanistan,
remember?

677
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:15,375
They hacked the security cameras
on the base, right?

678
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:16,500
That's right.

679
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:19,583
We don't know if we have time
for an operation like that.

680
01:10:19,666 --> 01:10:21,833
The vest could explode at any moment.

681
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:23,666
I think we have some leeway.

682
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:26,500
They like to extend suffering
as long as possible.

683
01:10:26,916 --> 01:10:29,166
In their words,
they said they want everyone

684
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,791
to see Santiago live.

685
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:34,083
-And?
-The sun hasn't come up yet in the US.

686
01:10:34,166 --> 01:10:37,000
It's not long,
but the time difference will help us.

687
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:39,291
And what about people looking outside?

688
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:42,916
They're already posting videos,
it'd be easy to discover the farce.

689
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,125
We'll have to shut down the internet
in Madrid for a few hours.

690
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:58,458
Gerardo?

691
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:07,916
At this point, we have nothing to lose.

692
01:11:14,291 --> 01:11:15,583
I can't take this.

693
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:21,000
I can't take it.

694
01:11:22,791 --> 01:11:25,541
-Raúl, where are you going?
-The bathroom.

695
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:28,208
No, no, no.
Please, please, don't touch him.

696
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:29,750
-Please, please.
-Okay, okay.

697
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:32,416
Listen.
I need to talk to my dad, please.

698
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,541
We have orders for you and your mother
to stay here until further notice.

699
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,916
I need to talk to him,
don't you get that?

700
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,875
No, we have an operation to save him,

701
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:41,958
-you have to trust us.
-I don't care!

702
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:44,000
-I have to talk to him now.
-Okay...

703
01:11:51,291 --> 01:11:52,416
Dad.

704
01:11:58,166 --> 01:11:59,291
Dad?

705
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,041
Go ahead, son.

706
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:02,666
I saw you on my phone.

707
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:06,583
You're everywhere, man.

708
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:09,791
You're blowing up online.

709
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:16,083
Raúl, you... You shouldn't be looking
at anything online.

710
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:18,416
Yeah. But what am I supposed to do?

711
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:22,750
Hey...

712
01:12:22,833 --> 01:12:23,958
Listen to me.

713
01:12:25,958 --> 01:12:28,166
Do me a favor, okay?

714
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:31,375
Don't give up.

715
01:12:33,166 --> 01:12:34,333
Okay?

716
01:12:34,916 --> 01:12:36,083
Please.

717
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:39,500
-Do you hear me?
-Yes.

718
01:12:40,125 --> 01:12:41,291
Yes...

719
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:47,750
I know you've felt like shit
since Mónica died...

720
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:55,125
Me too, Dad.

721
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:58,166
I'm exhausted.

722
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:02,000
I feel like...

723
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:04,333
I feel like nothing...

724
01:13:05,125 --> 01:13:09,041
Nothing is the same,
it's all cold and strange.

725
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,041
But Dad...

726
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:14,791
If you die now...

727
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:19,291
If you die now...

728
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:24,958
Well...

729
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:27,333
Mom and I will die too, okay?

730
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:30,833
Got it?

731
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,875
Raúl.

732
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:40,125
Raúl, listen to me.

733
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,416
Listen, everything will be okay.

734
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:44,708
Do you hear me?

735
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:47,500
These guys know what they're doing,
it'll be okay, promise.

736
01:13:47,916 --> 01:13:49,125
I promise.

737
01:13:54,791 --> 01:13:56,000
Son.

738
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:57,208
Son, I love you.

739
01:14:01,041 --> 01:14:02,250
I love you too.

740
01:14:04,208 --> 01:14:05,375
I love you too.

741
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:17,291
Look at the image. See it?

742
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:20,583
It's the same image over and over.

743
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:25,583
As security watched this,
three soldiers were dying right there.

744
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:27,250
We need something similar.

745
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:31,625
Yes, but it wouldn't work in this case
because Santiago is constantly moving,

746
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:32,916
so is the convoy.

747
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:37,958
We have to film
an empty section of Gran Vía.

748
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:41,083
A section they've never been to.

749
01:14:44,041 --> 01:14:46,958
And then, using artificial intelligence,

750
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:49,916
splice in a previous recording
of Santi and the convoy.

751
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:54,500
That way they'll still be moving.

752
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:57,041
And we can replace
one image with another

753
01:14:57,125 --> 01:15:00,291
at a specific moment
for them to leave the street.

754
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:10,166
Pilar.

755
01:15:10,916 --> 01:15:12,041
We'll be in touch.

756
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:20,583
Ready.

757
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:35,916
Santiago.

758
01:15:36,375 --> 01:15:39,041
You should eat something
and stay hydrated.

759
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:40,583
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

760
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:43,708
How about a drink?
Anything but alcohol is on the house.

761
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:47,666
I'll bet the house has never faced
someone like me before.

762
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:50,833
Actually, no.
You've really raised the bar for us.

763
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:54,583
But I'm grateful for the chance
to impress my bosses.

764
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:57,333
Don't be scared,
but it's only my third day.

765
01:15:57,791 --> 01:15:59,583
You've made a hell of an entrance.

766
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,291
You can say that again.

767
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,375
Hold on a minute.

768
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:21,791
PERFECT!

769
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:23,041
What does it say?

770
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:28,041
What's that mean? You have enough?

771
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:30,875
How long until sunrise
on the west coast of the US?

772
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:33,083
-Not long. We don't have time.
-Shit.

773
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:46,583
Do you have the images you need?

774
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:49,166
We're going as fast as we can,
we're almost there.

775
01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:51,041
Okay, thank you.

776
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:00,000
You're certainly in good shape.
Do you smoke?

777
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:03,125
No. Do you?

778
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:05,916
Like a chimney, but I want to quit.

779
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:31,666
Yes?

780
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:34,208
Accelerate the mission.

781
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:35,958
Number one or two?

782
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:37,500
Number one.

783
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:49,333
We have something.

784
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:54,083
We've intercepted a call
that could be related to the terrorists.

785
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:56,083
Here. In Madrid, in Lavapiés.

786
01:17:56,958 --> 01:17:59,583
-Good work, prepare the operation.
-Yes, sir.

787
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:30,958
Pilar.

788
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:32,583
-Yes?
-Pilar, a...

789
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:35,208
A phone rang and a timer started,

790
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:37,041
it's counting down from 21 minutes.

791
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:38,708
The lights changed.

792
01:18:39,041 --> 01:18:41,250
A timer was triggered.

793
01:18:42,208 --> 01:18:43,708
Relax, Santiago, we're here.

794
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:56,333
Now.

795
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:03,750
Yes?

796
01:19:03,833 --> 01:19:06,333
-Pilar, we're ready.
-Thank you.

797
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:11,250
-Prepare the detour.
-Everyone ready.

798
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:16,125
What's going on?

799
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:17,750
It seems the man is going...

800
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:20,750
-Does your Twitter work?
-Not WhatsApp, not Twitter, nothing.

801
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:22,166
Go ahead.

802
01:19:24,333 --> 01:19:25,500
Cue effect.

803
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:27,958
Effect ready.

804
01:19:28,375 --> 01:19:29,708
Roll effect in three...

805
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,875
Two... One...

806
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:32,041
Go.

807
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:39,791
Santiago, turn right when you can.

808
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:42,166
-Here, right, Pilar?
-Yes.

809
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:38,500
Santi...

810
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:58,125
Commander. Commander, get behind me.

811
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:08,375
Santiago.

812
01:21:09,583 --> 01:21:11,750
Santiago. Can you hear me?

813
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:17,458
-Yes.
-We have time and we won't fail.

814
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:19,750
Pilar...

815
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,375
Leave me alone, okay?

816
01:21:22,916 --> 01:21:24,375
Leave me alone, please.

817
01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:28,791
We aren't leaving you alone.

818
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:06,291
Santiago.

819
01:22:06,916 --> 01:22:08,791
We'll be in contact at all times.

820
01:22:09,916 --> 01:22:11,583
I'm behind you, I'm not leaving.

821
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:29,000
Let's go.

822
01:22:54,916 --> 01:22:56,291
"It's truly awful.

823
01:22:56,375 --> 01:23:01,208
How can an ordinary citizen,
like any one of us at this table,

824
01:23:01,291 --> 01:23:03,833
find himself in a situation
as grim as this one?

825
01:23:04,333 --> 01:23:07,416
I don't know
if we are doing better or worse

826
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,166
in the fight against terrorism,

827
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:12,250
but something like this
leaves a lot of unanswered questions.

828
01:23:12,958 --> 01:23:14,875
The fact that we still know nothing

829
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:18,333
about the reason for this situation
is incomprehensible.

830
01:23:18,416 --> 01:23:20,875
I'd even go as far
as to call it unacceptable.

831
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:24,500
Why are they letting us
record something like this?

832
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,083
His face says it all.

833
01:23:27,666 --> 01:23:30,291
And it's not just us Spaniards
wondering.

834
01:23:30,375 --> 01:23:33,208
People demand to know
what is happening and why."

835
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,166
Stop!

836
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,041
-Freeze!
-Don't move!

837
01:24:09,125 --> 01:24:11,458
-Freeze!
-Stop, get on the ground, dammit!

838
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:14,125
Freeze!

839
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,958
-Don't move, stop!
-Stop!

840
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:23,750
-Freeze!
-Get on the ground!

841
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:33,875
-You're under arrest, dammit!
-Stop!

842
01:24:33,958 --> 01:24:35,083
Stop!

843
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:38,416
Stop!

844
01:24:41,583 --> 01:24:43,625
Move aside!

845
01:24:50,958 --> 01:24:52,000
Are you okay?

846
01:24:52,625 --> 01:24:55,583
What happened?
A phone, there's a phone.

847
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:02,458
Hide it, hide it.

848
01:25:02,958 --> 01:25:06,208
-It looks broken.
-Maybe it's only the screen...

849
01:25:06,416 --> 01:25:08,750
Come on, quick.

850
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,500
I'll cut the first lock, okay?

851
01:25:52,708 --> 01:25:53,875
Almost done.

852
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:05,333
Santiago, how is it going?

853
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:08,875
Good.

854
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:10,500
Good, it's going good.

855
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:07,041
The first lock is off.

856
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:09,500
Now for the second.
Stay calm, stay calm, please.

857
01:27:09,583 --> 01:27:10,916
Just keep walking.

858
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:19,000
They've reached the area.

859
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,000
-You have to take us.
-Sorry, that's not possible.

860
01:27:22,083 --> 01:27:23,666
Stop saying it's not possible.

861
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:25,791
-Why not?
-Be quiet for a second, please!

862
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:30,250
Put yourself in my shoes.
I need to see him.

863
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:34,083
If the bomb explodes,
Santiago doesn't want you there.

864
01:27:44,166 --> 01:27:45,333
Santi?

865
01:27:47,875 --> 01:27:49,250
Santi, can you hear me?

866
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:51,791
Laura.

867
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,416
Santi, can you hear me? Are you there?

868
01:27:56,791 --> 01:27:59,291
-Santi...
-Yes, my love.

869
01:28:02,916 --> 01:28:04,083
Laura.

870
01:28:05,458 --> 01:28:06,666
Laura, listen to me.

871
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:09,625
I want to apologize.

872
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:13,416
I want to apologize to you and Raúl.

873
01:28:14,458 --> 01:28:16,291
Don't say that, my love, please.

874
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:20,041
I've been very unfair.

875
01:28:22,416 --> 01:28:25,958
But I love you so much, my love.
I love you both so much.

876
01:28:26,666 --> 01:28:27,958
I never stopped.

877
01:28:29,166 --> 01:28:30,500
You're my whole world.

878
01:28:30,708 --> 01:28:33,166
I know, my love, I know.

879
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:34,791
That's why I'm apologizing.

880
01:28:35,666 --> 01:28:36,875
I'm so sorry.

881
01:28:37,708 --> 01:28:40,833
But listen,
now I need you to focus on you.

882
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:43,875
And saving yourself.
Do you hear me, Santi?

883
01:28:45,333 --> 01:28:48,666
I know you will. I know it.

884
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,875
You know I hate it
that you always get your way,

885
01:28:52,375 --> 01:28:54,958
that you're always right.
But listen, this time,

886
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:58,625
I want you to fight
with everything you have, you hear me?

887
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:01,958
With everything you have, okay, honey?

888
01:29:03,458 --> 01:29:04,791
Stubborn as a mule.

889
01:29:05,833 --> 01:29:08,916
That's it, that's it, my love,
don't think about anything else.

890
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,166
Just that mule.

891
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:11,916
Okay, my love?

892
01:29:14,375 --> 01:29:16,375
Promise me, please.

893
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:19,375
Mule’s honor.

894
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:23,666
I love you, honey. I love you so much.

895
01:29:25,916 --> 01:29:27,083
You too, my dear.

896
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:55,208
I don't think it works.

897
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,833
We should check the contacts
and call somebody.

898
01:30:06,791 --> 01:30:08,500
It's not ours, Jamal.

899
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:10,333
-We'll call tomorrow.
-No.

900
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:17,500
-Look, there are only two numbers.
-Then call the first one.

901
01:30:28,458 --> 01:30:29,750
There's no answer.

902
01:30:33,041 --> 01:30:34,666
-Jesús.
-Stay calm.

903
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:36,708
-Santi, calm down, okay?
-Jesús, Jesús.

904
01:30:36,791 --> 01:30:39,250
Something happened, the numbers changed.

905
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:40,500
Hold on.

906
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:43,958
Okay, stay calm. Stay calm, okay?

907
01:30:58,625 --> 01:30:59,708
Hello?

908
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:01,375
Who is this?

909
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:03,125
Who are you?

910
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:05,000
Jamal.

911
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:22,708
Okay.

912
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,791
I'm moving to the last lock, okay?
The last lock.

913
01:31:29,125 --> 01:31:30,250
Okay, come on.

914
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:40,875
-How is it going?
-Good, good.

915
01:31:42,166 --> 01:31:43,958
Whatever you do, don't turn around.

916
01:32:17,916 --> 01:32:20,583
Okay, there. Stay calm, Santi, okay?

917
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:27,833
Where did this come from?

918
01:32:29,791 --> 01:32:31,625
Whose phone is this, Jamal?

919
01:32:31,958 --> 01:32:35,625
-I found it on the street.
-And you just thought you'd keep it?

920
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:38,958
-When it's not yours?
-Can you let us watch the game in peace?

921
01:32:39,583 --> 01:32:41,291
Okay, there. Stay calm.

922
01:32:41,458 --> 01:32:42,708
It's done, hang on.

923
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:44,333
I'm almost done, come on.

924
01:32:53,916 --> 01:32:56,333
Fucking hell!

925
01:32:57,125 --> 01:32:58,666
Come on, come on, come on.

926
01:33:04,208 --> 01:33:05,750
God fuck dammit.

927
01:33:18,875 --> 01:33:19,958
Jesús...

928
01:33:24,958 --> 01:33:26,916
Take it off, take it off! Take it off!

929
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,416
Come on, take it off.
Take it off, take it off.

930
01:33:29,958 --> 01:33:31,041
Come on.

931
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:35,166
Take it off. God dammit...

932
01:33:37,958 --> 01:33:39,250
Wait, wait, wait.

933
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:41,291
Okay, okay...

934
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:44,083
Take it off, take it off. Run, run!

935
01:33:47,916 --> 01:33:48,958
Run, run!

936
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:58,666
Come on, come on.

937
01:34:07,166 --> 01:34:08,416
Santiago, how are you?

938
01:34:09,583 --> 01:34:11,416
Huh? How are you?

939
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:13,083
Jesús...

940
01:34:13,625 --> 01:34:14,833
Jesús, Jesús.

941
01:34:15,291 --> 01:34:17,166
Are you conscious? Are you conscious?

942
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:19,125
Are you conscious?

943
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,916
-Hello...
-What's your name?

944
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:23,291
What's your name?

945
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:25,041
-Jesús.
-Jesús, I'm a doctor.

946
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:26,416
-Look at me.
-Your name?

947
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,708
-Are you okay?
-Santi...

948
01:34:27,791 --> 01:34:30,208
Santi. Easy, Santi,
I'm putting a brace on you.

949
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,416
Are you okay?

950
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:38,041
Jesús... It's okay, come on.

951
01:34:38,208 --> 01:34:40,375
A plane is coming for you.

952
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:42,083
Good. Anything hurt?

953
01:34:48,583 --> 01:34:49,750
Breathe normally.

954
01:34:50,583 --> 01:34:51,750
Breathe normally.

955
01:35:05,958 --> 01:35:07,958
So? How are you?

956
01:35:08,958 --> 01:35:10,125
Fine.

957
01:35:11,416 --> 01:35:12,958
Your family is on their way.

958
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:14,958
Do you need anything?

959
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:16,916
No, thank you.

960
01:35:19,458 --> 01:35:20,666
You did it.

961
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:24,791
We did it.

962
01:35:28,208 --> 01:35:29,291
Commander.

963
01:35:39,666 --> 01:35:40,708
Pilar.

964
01:35:41,166 --> 01:35:43,208
-You did well, very well.
-Thank you.

965
01:35:44,125 --> 01:35:46,166
"None of us will forget this day

966
01:35:46,291 --> 01:35:49,041
that is now inscribed
in our nation's history.

967
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,416
And it's all thanks
to a masterful operation

968
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:55,375
by security forces
in close collaboration with the media

969
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:58,333
that's never been seen before
and they've managed to outwit

970
01:35:58,416 --> 01:36:01,375
the abominable orders
of the terrorists..."

971
01:37:34,916 --> 01:37:37,500
The ground is looking at us

972
01:37:38,208 --> 01:37:40,583
The sky is supporting us

973
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:43,958
We took what we were given

974
01:37:44,666 --> 01:37:47,166
We each used it how we wanted

975
01:37:48,291 --> 01:37:50,125
Look at me from afar

976
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:53,875
You feel so close

977
01:37:54,958 --> 01:37:56,833
Look at me from afar

978
01:37:57,833 --> 01:38:00,666
I don't want you near me anymore

979
01:38:01,583 --> 01:38:03,958
I split in half

980
01:38:04,916 --> 01:38:07,250
I learned to come back

981
01:38:08,333 --> 01:38:11,416
Move aside if you don't know how to look

982
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:14,666
Don't let anyone tell you not to cry

983
01:38:15,458 --> 01:38:17,708
Not to cry

984
01:38:22,041 --> 01:38:24,500
Not to cry

985
01:38:28,166 --> 01:38:31,500
The storm is about to hit

986
01:38:31,583 --> 01:38:34,666
People love when things go wrong for you

987
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:38,000
They give you Judas' kiss to drink

988
01:38:38,083 --> 01:38:41,958
They'll kill you a thousand times
But you're reborn again

989
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:44,458
You're reborn again

990
01:38:45,458 --> 01:38:47,500
My love

991
01:38:48,833 --> 01:38:50,666
My love

992
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:54,125
My love

993
01:38:55,125 --> 01:38:57,083
My love

994
01:38:58,625 --> 01:39:00,583
My love

995
01:39:02,041 --> 01:39:03,750
My love

996
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Maybe no one could show you

997
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:14,125
That the world has many sides

998
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:17,041
And by looking at them head on

999
01:39:17,708 --> 01:39:20,458
You can better dodge the bullets

1000
01:39:21,333 --> 01:39:24,000
You're greeted as you pass

1001
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:27,375
You can be sure of that

1002
01:39:27,958 --> 01:39:30,791
But only a firm gesture

1003
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:32,458
Distant

1004
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:34,208
Poison

1005
01:39:35,458 --> 01:39:37,583
Far from this door

1006
01:39:38,833 --> 01:39:40,416
Far from this house

1007
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,916
Far from this air

1008
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:51,166
The storm is about to hit

1009
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:54,625
People love when things go wrong for you

1010
01:39:55,083 --> 01:39:58,041
They give you Judas' kiss to drink

1011
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:02,291
They'll kill you a thousand times
But you're reborn again

1012
01:40:02,583 --> 01:40:04,958
You're reborn again

1013
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:07,791
My love

1014
01:40:09,041 --> 01:40:11,666
My love

1015
01:40:11,875 --> 01:40:14,625
My love

1016
01:40:17,875 --> 01:40:20,958
My love

1017
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:24,666
My love

1018
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:27,833
My love

1019
01:40:28,416 --> 01:40:30,916
My love

1020
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:34,125
My love

1021
01:40:38,666 --> 01:40:40,250
My love

1022
01:40:45,208 --> 01:40:46,833
My love
