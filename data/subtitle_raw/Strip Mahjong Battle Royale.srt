1
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,870
Question:

2
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,313
"Does stripping reveal
just the ï¬‚esh?"

3
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,710
The answer is "No."

4
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,872
It reveals one's personality,
individuality, and past...

5
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:59,312
In other words,
stripping reveals the soul.

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,115
One game wonderfully reveals all
of this.

7
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,869
It's name is...

8
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:16,998
Strip Mahjong!

9
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,558
Now it's time for Strip Mahjong.

10
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,950

11
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,553

12
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,350

13
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,351

00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,751

17
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,557

<i>Ah studio?</i>

21
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,392
<i>Ah mahjong parlor?</i>

22
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,996

and using her youth as her weapon,

26
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,191
it's teen idol Yuka Kashiwagi!

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,795

Uptown girl from Shirokanedai,
Misuzu Kaneda!

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,514
I wish I could live in Shirokanedai!

36
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,999
Actually, Misuzu is my type of girl.

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,238
Odds: 7.3, she's the dark horse!

38

A freeter who works late

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,873
Use that money well!

<i>What?</i>

43
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,430
<i>Got to remember!</i>

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,679
<i>What the hell happened?</i>

45
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,276
<i>I remember! It was him!</i>

46
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,080
<i>That guy abducted me.</i>

47
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,675
This program is brought to you live
via an exclusive channel

48
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,276
through pay-per-view fees
from you, our viewers.

49
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,670
It's live! It's liiive!

50
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,878
We'll do anything
for our customers!

51
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,879
Now, let's explain the rules!

52
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,270
Welcome to the 'World
of Strip Mahjong!

53
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,876
We ask everyone to play nice

54
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,509
and follow these rules.

55
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,879
Basic rules are mostly the same
as a normal Hanchan game,

56
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,910
a single two-round game
using Ari-Ari rules.

57
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,912
We'll use our own system
for Han points.

58
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,869
Instead of point sticks, players pay the winner
with "Strip Cards" and strip accordingly

59
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,875
Everyone starts with 7 points,
7 articles of clothing

60
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,713
Yakuman = 6 points

61
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,314
Sanbaiman = 5 points

62
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,709
Batman = 4 points

63
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,314
Haneman = 3 points

64
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,959
Mangan = 2 points

65
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,554
Anything less = 1 point

66
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,198
<i>Strip</i> Mahjong---?

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,356
By the way, any player
who goes bust,

68
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,114
that is, loses all
her "Strip Cards,"

69
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,950
faces a severe punishment.

70
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,349
Punishment...?

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,958
Objection! This is a blatant
case of wrongful imprisonment!

72
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,359
Objection overruled.

73
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,353
But I've got recorded evidence...

74
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,876
Yes, we're recording right now...

75
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,915
Let me out! Let me out of here!

76
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,159
The only one getting out
...is the winner!

77
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,391
Ha! That's just a toy.
You think we're stupid'?

78
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:54,595
Ah toy? Yes, but it does send
an electric shock. Zap! Zap!

79
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,835
Understand now? Please don't do
anything reckless.

80
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,637
You sure you don't want to strip?

81
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,875
OK, we get it, so stop!
We'll do it.

82
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,431
- I am glad to have your understanding.
- Fuck that!

83
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,433
I'll report you!
We're not some exhibition!

84
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,194
Shut up, bitches!

85
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,835
You still don't get it?

86
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,038
You're all good for nothing,

87
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,078
except for getting naked!

88
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,194
"Why are you here?"

89
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,472
You've all racked up
$5 million in debts...

90
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,470
but has that stopped your
obsessions with online mahjong?

91
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,877
You're here because you're
worthless human beings!

92
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,236
What!? You can't do this!

93
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,238
Please shut the fuck up!

94
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,033
May I finish?

95
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,036
None of you can pay off
your debts yourselves.

96
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,751
We're giving you the chance to
pay them off in full.

97
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,078
Everyone, please.

98
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,675
Strip down to the soul,

99
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:11,439
then win and pay off your debts!

100
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,918
Let's get up. Can you stand?

101
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,073
Please excuse my earlier rudeness.

102
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,073
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

103
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,517
'Win and you can leave.

104
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,311
- Wait, I don't have any de--
Everyone! Please be seated.

105
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,119
Let the Strip Mahjong begin!

106
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:09,719
<i>Round</i> 1 <i>Hand</i> 1

107
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,874
The Dora Indicator
is the 4 Circles tile.

108
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,750
The East Wind seat
and first dealer is Aoi Onizuka,

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,550
the South Wind seat
is Mirai Kisaragi,

110
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,191
the West 'Wind seat
is Misuzu Kaneda,

111
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,591
and North Wind seat
is Yuka Kashiwagi.

112
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,073
Turns will proceed in that order.

113
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,155
<i>Ah nice starting hand...</i>

114
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,231
<i>This woman's named... Misuzu?</i>

115
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,596
<i>She's discarding all Simples.</i>

116
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,958
<i>She's the type
who relies on intuition.</i>

117
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,632
<i>And this would be Yuka.</i>

118
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,719
<i>Seems sure of herself.</i>

119
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:29,189
And Aoi Shanpai,
maybe Tenpai-type?

120
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,033
Your turn.

121
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,749
Oh, sorry.

122
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,635
Ranran, you can see each
player's style...

123
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,397
Yes, each is fairly unique

124
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,231
We can see people for who they
are through Mahjong

125
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,677
Mirai has a cautious approach.

126
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,238
She's aware of what goes on
around her. She seems somewhat good.

127
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,678
She must've been quite the
lazy bitch to hone such skills.

128
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,232
<i>She discarded the tile she just
drew... What's she waiting on?</i>

129
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,074
Hey, it's your turn.

130
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,913
Sorry.

131
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,277
Can you try not to space out?

132
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,239
Le--let's all calm down a bit.

133
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,393
You first.

134
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,950
Look at your hand.

135
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,074
Reach

136
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,716
Mirai has declared a "Reach."

137
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,716
Let's pick a Strip Card
for your wager!

138
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,355
<i>Outerwear</i>

139
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,113
She's chosen "Outerwear!

140
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,480
If Mirai wins this hand, the losers
must remove their outerwear.

141
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:08,918
However, if Mirai loses,
she'll have to remove her own!

142
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,039
What? I didn't hear that rule!

143
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,554
Yeah, I didn't mention it.

144
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,998
Reach

145
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,399
TOP

146
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,314
The game is now afoot!
Aoi's wagered her "Top" card

147
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,710
It's getting interesting!

148
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,512
Mirai has secured a Mangan with
the possibility for a Batman,

149
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,955
but Aoi's hot in pursuit.
She too may have a Mangan.

150
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,554
The tiles I need have already
been discarded. I'll have to fold...

151
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,360
You're not supposed to say that
out loud.

152
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,311
Ron!

153
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,434
Reach All Simples No-Points Hand
Three Color Straight Dora 1

154
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,397
Haneman

155
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,749
<i>You don't have to glare
at me like that...</i>

156
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,391
"Hey, stop it!

157
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:44,233
The stripping time you've all
been waiting for has come!

158
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,235
Aoi will pay up
with three Strip Cards.

159
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,235
Two will be the "Outerwear" and
"Top" already on the table.

160
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,031
Our winner, Mirai, will choose
the remaining third card.

161
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,229
- Me?
- Those are the rules.

162
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,836
OK... "Socks."

163
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,837
"Socks" it is! In this case,
gartered stockings!

164
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,198
Hey, you! Cut it out!

165
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,029
Don't mind her. It's the game.

166
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,075
<i>This woman... is married?</i>

167
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,473
Aoi, please share
how you feel right now.

168
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,270
Th-- this is illegal!

169
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,469
Yes, it probably is.

170
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:55,072
Ok, I hear you.
I'll strip, I'll do it!

171
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,552
My my, such nice calves,

172
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,713
what you might call...
a guilty pleasure!

173
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,072
<i>Next, off with the top!</i>

174
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,559
Well then...

175
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,358
Wait a second.

176
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,958
No, I can't wait...

177
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:06,512
Aah! Stop! Stop! No! Stop! Stop!

178
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,591
It may be embarrassing, but...

179
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,595
What's this?
Ah tattoo of a peony tree!

180
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,198
Why'd you get something like that,
Aoi-chan?

181
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,195
Don't look at me!

182
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,996
Strip Time is over...

183
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,559
The next hand will start
with Misuzu! Nyan!

184
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,599
You won't forget this,
you little bitch...

185
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:08,633
<i>Round 1 Hand 2</i>

186
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,913
Aww, it seems that Aoi bears
a grudge against Mirai...

187
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,233
<i>What kind of person
is this woman?</i>

188
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:29,595
Uh, um, can't we all get along?

189
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,838
We have to think of how we're all
going to get out of here...

190
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:42,031
You let us know when you've
figured that one out.

191
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,838
Come on, hurry up!

192
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,679
Huh?

193
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,674
Misuzu, what appears
to be the problem?

194
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,675
I... won...

195
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,034
Closed Tsumo lipeiko

196
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,680
lipeiko! lipeiko! lipeiko!

197
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,830
It's an lipeiko!

198
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,637
I, I didn't mean to...

199
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,639
It's time for the three of you
to take off one item!

200
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:24,110
Misuzu, please choose
a Strip Card.

201
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,320
I'm sorry...

202
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,437
Bottom

203
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:42,514
Bottom it is! Haha,
who should it be...

204
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,712
First... Yukarin!

205
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,717
No way!

206
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,358
Hands off!

207
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,355
It's out! Her ex-delinquent ways
she learned when in a gang!

208
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,557
Seriously, I will kill you!

209
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,555
Tough girl, huh?
I think she tries too hard!

210
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,351
You sure you won't strip?
Even if I punish you...

211
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,399
Here they are! The bare legs of a
one-time delinquent, now a teen idol!

212
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,191
And next...

213
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,753
I-'moi!

214
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,799
Such beautiful, shapely legs...

215
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,191
and this time, she stripped
without fuss.

216
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,794
And last...

217
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,193
Mirai !

218
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,234
Do it!

219
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,237
Stop...

220
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,637
Make it stop already!

221
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,835
Got 'em! We got 'em off!

222
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,877
Hmph, that's what you get
for resisting.

223
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,110
Wasn't that what you did last time?

224
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,075
<i>Round 1 Hand 3</i>

225
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,673
Round 1 Hand 3. So far, Aoi
Nyah, Nyah!

226
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,278
Has been hostile to Yuka and Mirai.
Nyah, nyah!

227
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,037
They continue to fight without
any womanly code of honor. Nyan!

228
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,071
Reach

229
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,277
Bra

230
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,918
Oops, sorry.

231
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,431
<i>Ha, now I'll get my payback!</i>

232
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,911
Not going for Three Colors, she's
set a trap with the 5 Circles tile.

233
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:14,512
<i>She's going after Mimi...
Mimi, you must spot the trap!</i>

234
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,918
Oops, how clumsy of me.

235
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,558
<i>Ah play for the B Circles tile...?</i>

236
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,710
This isn't right!
Misuzu is giving hints to Mirai.

237
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,915
<i>She got the hint?
Why is everyone after me?</i>

238
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,916
Hmm, End of Round 1 Hand 3

239
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,552
<i>Draw</i>

240
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,916
Tenpai

241
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,915
Tenpai

242
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,749
Tenpai

243
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,990
Tenpai

244
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,949
You were all in Tenpai?
So close!

245
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,389
This means Yukarin's Bra card
is up for grabs in the next hand.

246
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,956
That was a close one
which anyone could've won.

247
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,593
Next is Round 1 Hand 3, but with
1 Bonus in Play. Misuzu is still the dealer.

248
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,233
<i>Round 1 Hand 3 With 1 Bonus</i>

249
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,993
Yuka had her Strip Card taken away.

250
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,278
She'll want to win this hand, even
with a cheap hand, to get it back...

251
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,633
Reach

252
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,200
Outerwear

253
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,949
Yukarin is in a rush, isn't she?

254
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,279
<i>Here it comes...</i>

255
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,436
<i>She's also in Tenpai...
but I can still get her.</i>

256
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,233
<i>It's a trap, Misuzu. Be careful.</i>

257
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,037
<i>I'm no good.
I can't do anything now!</i>

258
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,674
Tsumo!

259
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,719
<i>Reach Closed Tsumo
Three Color Straight</i>

260
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,393
Mangan

261
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,510
Congratulations! I return to you
your confiscated card.

262
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,034
Yes!

263
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,718
"Outerwear" is on the table, so
please choose one more card...

264
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:20,276
Ah, but Aoi is not wearing outerwear,
so choose two extra cards for her.

265
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,278
- Why for only me!?
- Shhhh!

266
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,710
Go ahead, Yukarin.

267
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,272
This one's for Mirai
(Socks)

268
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,910
and this is for Misuzu,
(TOP)

269
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,318
What's wrong, Misuzu?

270
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,114
Now, the cards for Aoi...

271
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,118
This... and this one!
(Bra) (Glasses)

272
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:01,153
Hoho! Scandalous! Yukarin had
no problems choosing for Aoi!

273
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,116
The cards for Aoi are "Bra" and "Glasses!"

274
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,760
Hey you! Knock it off!

275
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,151
Knock what off?

276
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,352
Let the Stripping Time begin!

277
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,710
Mirai, your outerwear
and socks, please.

278
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,989
<i>No, now's not the time...
I have to focus on winning now.</i>

279
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,232
The scent of fragrant olive...

280
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,195
Moving on, Misuzu, please.

281
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,191
It's OK... It can't be helped.

282
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,677
<i>What's wrong, Misuzu?
You're acting strangely.</i>

283
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,879
Wha--, what's this?
An S&M bustier!?

284
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,079
Amazing, but...

285
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:10,235
...unexpected! Not something
I'd expect a refined lady to wear...

286
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,912
Is this to please
your husband's tastes?

287
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,272
Things have suddenly gotten
more interesting!

288
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,469
Next, let's have Aoi remove
her bra and glasses!

289
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,720
The moment you've all been
waiting for! Mac Kato's...

290
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,917
Don't you mean "MC Kato's?"

291
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,472
...Lingerie Time!

292
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,115
This is when I use various items
to remove the clothing.

293
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,511
Aah! Stop it!

294
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,320
No, stop!

295
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,358
What are you doing?
Just, just quit it!

296
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,959
I'll catch you,
tuna fish!

297
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,320
Hey!

298
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,354
Got a bite!

299
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,316
Stop it! Stop it!

300
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,951
Hey! Knock it off, will you?

301
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,356
Stop it!

302
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,309
- No!
- Got 'em!

303
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,955
Caught myself one bra!

304
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,432
Regarding gifts to our viewers...

305
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,399
We offer the lewd she-lawyer's
glasses and...

306
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:32,229
her freshly-removed
and still warm brassiere!

307
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,592
We will then ship the prize
to the winner! Nyan!

308
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,840
<i>Round 1 Hand 4</i>

309
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,431
It's the 8th go around. The Dora Indicator
is the 2 Characters tile. The dealer is Aoi.

310
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,871
Since she lost her glasses,
Aoi's struggled to see the tiles.

311
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,079
Don't give up the will to win!

312
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,070
Go ahead, make fun of me...

313
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,277
I'm not.

314
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,869
I never thought something
like this would happen...

315
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,439
Listen, you have to focus now.

316
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,070
<i>Ha, got it...
Secured myself 4 Dora!</i>

317
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,476
Kan!

318
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,952
<i>Well, hello!</i>

319
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,033
<i>Looks like she's out for blood.
Could it be...?</i>

320
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,473
<i>The same tile others
have discarded...</i>

321
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,514
Pon!

322
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,396
<i>Careful now;
if you step in now...</i>

323
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,951
<i>One short of Tenpai. Low chance on</i>
a <i>quad for the 8 Characters fife.</i>

324
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,512
<i>I've</i> a <i>concealed triplet on the 7
Characters tile. What should I</i> do...

325
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:16,991
<i>This will get he; but it may be dangerous for Misuzu.
She seems close to Mangan.</i>

326
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,236
<i>Huh!</i>

327
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,757
Misuzu?

328
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,599
She can't see the table...
She's completely lost if.

329
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,635
<i>South Wind is also a safe discard...
Wait! If she's got a double-sided wait...</i>

330
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,429
<i>She's given up Circles and Characters...
Her waits are concentrated on Bamboos...</i>

331
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,039
<i>But that's the same for Misuzu...</i>

332
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,634
<i>If my waits are good, I can discard
my draws until I get what I need...</i>

333
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,634
<i>I can then keep myself in Tenpai
with a double-side wait sequence.</i>

334
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,312
<i>She's giving this</i> a <i>Jot of thought.
Discarding Bamboos is dangerous, Misuzu.</i>

335
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,038
Ron!

336
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,119
<i>All Simples No-Points Hand
Three Closed Triplets Dora</i> 7

337
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:47,277
Wow, "Sanbaiman!" Misuzu will
have to strip 5 items!

338
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,071
Three Closed Triplets with
a Closed Tsumo and a Dora of 7!

339
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,077
That's checkmate for you,
Misuzu. Boo hoo!

340
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,674
This is my fate...

341
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,872
I racked up so much debt
losing Mahjong,

342
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,111
I never had a chance winning here...

343
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,037
Wait! What's gonna happen
to her now?

344
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,479
OK, OK, <i>I</i> got it.
Just wait a second!

345
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:49,909
'Win, OK'? You have to live life
to its fullest.

346
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:58,711
You only get one life. Make
it count. Don't become like me.

347
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,358
But Misuzu, I...

348
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,310
It's OK, I know you can do it.

349
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,554
<i>Let's go!</i>

350
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,798
We're giving you a big punishment!

351
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,440
- Stop, stop...
- Wait!

352
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,991
You think it's fun to make
people suffer like this?

353
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,197
No, I think it's sad.
But these are the rules...

354
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,791
Misuzu!

355
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,231
So why are you wearing
a leather bustier?

356
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,795
I just have to strip off
5 items, right?

357
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,999
I asked you a question, why
are you wearing that bustier?

358
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:59,029
Stop, you don't have to
take everything off.

359
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,277
Huh?

360
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,271
Showing just your skin
means nothing...

361
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,469
I'm hereto see everything
laid bare, body and soul

362
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,877
My soul...?

363
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,080
Yes! Open your heart!

364
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,073
Out with it! Why the bustier!

365
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,915
It started a year ago, when I...

366
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,077
I found out my husband
was cheating on me...

367
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,839
Good!

368
00:37:50,560 --> 00:38:00,117
Our relationship went cold...
I sought escape and passion...

369
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,920
You're a cheap whore!

370
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:10,309
Then, the partner I met
taught me S&M...

371
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,872
So that's how you got into it.

372
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,911
I just wanted my husband to love me...

373
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,911
more...

374
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:47,958
...to beloved more!
But, it wasn't going to happen.

375
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,152
That's it.
That's what I wanted to hear.

376
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,596
But I loved him...

377
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,998
I loved my husband!

378
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:19,597
Thank you for baring all to me.

379
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,029
I'll take these panties
off for you.

380
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,474
Aah! Stop! Stop! Stop!

381
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,317
Stop! No! Stop!

382
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,473
I can leave now, right?

383
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,320
Only the winner
of the game gets out.

384
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,994
Farewell, my love.

385
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,675
Instant death? That's
the Maximum Setting for you...

386
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,519
He's lying...

387
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,994
She can't be dead, right?

388
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,713
What's happened to Misuzu?

389
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,314
I'm sorry, but...

390
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,552
Wait! If we go bust, do we also...?

391
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,750
Yes.

392
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,109
What the fuck!

393
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,355
Hey, those are the rules.
Now, shall we continue?

394
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,112
Just a second.

395
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,314
And what is the matter, Mirai?

396
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,755
Give me her wedding ring
in exchange for this

397
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,956
Are you serious!?

398
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,512
You know you're just tightening
your own noose doing this?

399
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,753
I, I wasn't able to save Misuzu,

400
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,152
but if I get out of here alive,

401
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,634
I want to give her ring to her husband

402
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,358
I'm touched...

403
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,998
No problem, so long as you
exchange a Strip Card for the ring.

404
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:43,829
'Win, OK'? You have to live life
to its fullest.

405
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,636
<i>You can do it</i>

406
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:57,191
Now we've put that drama behind us,
let's get back into the game.

407
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,638
Let's introduce our
substitute player!

408
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:13,230
In our last match, she gave us
a wonderful fight to the death.

409
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,038
Behind the cute looks is a brain
trained for Mahjong since childhood.

410
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,831
Alias "Killer Mahjong Queen,"
it's Ranran Tachibana

411
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,316
Pleased to join the game! Nyan!

412
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:33,238
Ranran will start with 5 points,
what Misuzu had before going bust.

413
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,754
<i>Round 2 Hand 1</i>

414
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,189
<i>I'm going to win!</i>

415
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,715
Hey, Yukarin, guess what?
I'm going after you!

416
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,869
Huh?

417
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:01,274
It's cause you've
got the most clothes on...

418
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,160
When sleeping around for
recording contracts,

419
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,516
-these come right off, huh?
- I don't do that

420
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,278
<i>Who is... this woman</i>

421
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,033
I've no intention losing to you

422
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:22,551
Let's have a one-on-one side bet
for one extra article of clothing.

423
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,716
You're on!

424
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,470
<i>You shouldn't provoke her.</i>

425
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,318
Ah storm's been brewing since
Ranran entered the game!

426
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,231
PO", nyah!

427
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:54,958
<i>How is she making the calls
and discards so fast? It's unreal!</i>

428
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,599
<i>It's no good,
loan'! read her at all...</i>

429
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:40,151
Ron. Big Three Dragons, nyah

430
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,272
<i>She's strong ...too strong</i>

431
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,556
Nyan nyan

432
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:55,792
Wow! Ah yakuman from out of nowhere!
It's quick death for you, Yukarin!

433
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,956
Huh? Huhuhuhuh?
What's the matter, Yukarin?

434
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,235
No, I don't want to die!

435
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:14,240
Tough Yukarin is now groveling...
I am a sucker for women's tears...

436
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,596
-but it's Punishment 1'lme!
- Nyah

437
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,437
Well then...

438
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,432
Ooh, teenage years... nice

439
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,433
Stop... No! Stop!

440
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,077
What a wonderful scent...

441
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,075
- Let me to take it off... slowly!
- No no no no no...

442
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,880
You can't, you can't, you can't!

443
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,434
Isn't that a... swimsuit for school!?

444
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,874
Hold on a second!

445
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,469
I'll return to Yukarin what she
wagered on our side-bet.

446
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,519
<i>Underwear</i>

447
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,351
Now even Ranran's pulling
this sort of shit...?

448
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,918
Since she's an idol,
it should be a bikini...

449
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:43,309
<i>- Butsurely, replacing a one-piece
with a two-piece item isn't fair...</i>

450
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:48,911
Won't it be boring
to kill her off now though?

451
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,115
Alright! We take back
Yukarin as going bust!

452
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,956
Stop...

453
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,389
It's now two items. You're keeping
only the panties though.

454
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,800
- It's Mac Kato's--
- Don't you mean MC Kato's...

455
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,270
Lingerie Time!

456
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,838
What are you doing!? Cut it out!

457
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,434
Wow, it's turning
into a giant titty!

458
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,237
I'm scared! I'm scared! I'm scared!

459
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,439
Isn't this great, Yukarin?
You've been spared.

460
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:16,113
<i>Round 2 Hand 2</i>

461
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,075
Were you OK in there?

462
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:30,637
You're OK, right?
Nyan Nyan Nyan Nyan Nyan

463
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,070
<i>She's got such composure! But I
can't let her put me on the ropes.</i>

464
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:44,272
<i>Got it! Others are discarding bamboos.
I should quietly wait it out...</i>

465
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:59,631
<i>Last go around, but I'll beat her.</i>

466
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,320
...This tile's probably safe
to discard, nyah...

467
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,349
Ron, Haneman!

468
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,353
<i>Half-Flush Dora 2</i>

469
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,152
Bullseye! Ah Haneman
from out of nowhere!

470
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,914
Ranran, that'll cost you 3 items!

471
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,158
At last, I can cool down a bit,.
Nyan!

472
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,393
<i>Other Bra Top</i>

473
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,717
An interesting choice.

474
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,760
I'll be wearing just an apron?

475
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,154
Roger that!

476
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,752
Music, please!

477
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:57,353
<i>She's not upset at all.
On the contrary, she enjoys iL..</i>

478
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,678
Ah magnificent "nude apron" look!

479
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,480
I do it all for our viewers!

480
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,714
<i>Round 2 Hand 3</i>

481
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,277
Hey everyone, Let's try
and enjoy the game a bit more!

482
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,674
Are you fucked in the head? We
over here have our lives at stake.

483
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,872
It's the same for Ranran, too.
Boo hoo!

484
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,429
<i>This is a battle of wits... Can 't
let her crazy talk trip me up.</i>

485
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,354
<i>Reach</i>

486
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,395
Outerwear

487
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,837
Amazing, Ranran. That's our
mahjong fanatic in a maid outfit!

488
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,912
<i>It's OK, stay cool...</i>

489
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,716
Ah!

490
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,871
Sorryy...

491
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,919
Wait! That's a Chonbo penalty!

492
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,878
It wasn't on purpose. Forgive me...

493
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,519
We can't!

494
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:41,516
Yes, we can! I owe this woman
my life.

495
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,915
<i>You can't take this
woman's side.</i>

496
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:55,755
Ron!
Reach and a Straight, nyan!

497
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,759
<i>How? My discard let her win?</i>

498
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,953
Ranran won on a Hell Wait. Mirai,
that'll cost you one item!

499
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,349
I won this hand forjust one card.

500
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,956
So, Ranran, can you choose a card?

501
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,958
Nyan Nyan Nyan Nyan Nyan, bra!

502
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:23,351
Bra it is! Then let's begin...
the Stripping Time!

503
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,398
You're bad, too, you know.

504
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,951
What?

505
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:45,679
<i>- You got into this helping a friend
with her mahjong gambling debts.</i>

506
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:53,629
My friend begged me
and before I knew it...

507
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:02,633
You shouldn't so easily agree to
be someone's guarantor like that...

508
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:59,993
So how does it feel to get naked?

509
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,436
That concludes Lingerie Time!

510
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:10,433
<i>Round 2 Hand 4</i>

511
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,070
<i>If she wins now those two
will end up like Misuzu...</i>

512
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,075
<i>I must beat her!</i>

513
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,238
Tsumo!

514
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,279
Amazing! You won on a Hell Wait
for the North Wind tile again!?

515
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,918
Let's first choose the Strip
Card for Mirai.

516
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,118

Other!

517
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,511
Other it is! That'd be...

518
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,076
Uh... the Cat Garter.

519
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,119
You can take that off later,
whatever.

520
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:01,559
More importantly, I'm sorry,
but Yukarin and Aoi...

521
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,951
You've gone bust!

522
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:09,320
Please, save me! Please!

523
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,554
Please!

524
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,551
Sorry, I play to win.

525
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,516
<i>Wait, somethings not right...</i>

526
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,198
<i>With that hand, she should have
gotten sanmenchan...</i>

527
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,319
<i>Why win on</i> a <i>Single Pair Wait
for the North Wind tile?</i>

528
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,558
And now, what you have all been
waiting for... Punishment Time!

529
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,760
I'm Yukarin.

530
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:46,353
And I'm Aoi. We're good friends.

531
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,599
I like you

532
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,593
I like you, too.

533
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,992
Ah...Ah...Ah...

534
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,598
What's this? My body feels hot
...with passion!

535
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,349
Come on! Do it like the dolls...

536
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,198
If you're going to kill us,
just kill us already!

537
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:18,594
You want to be spared, don't you?
I'll let you go if you dyke it out.

538
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,592
Ha, that's a lie!

539
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,829
I don't get to see that
sort of thing too often...

540
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,392
What are you doing!?

541
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,399
It might save our lives!

542
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,640
Knock it off!

543
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,833
Actually, I am a lesbian.

544
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,594
That's nothing I know about.

545
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,033
Really? I'm a lesbian? But why?

546
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,396
I've come to hate men.
nasty, perverted men

547
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,872
So you were sleeping around
for your career...

548
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,038
No, I was forced into doing that!

549
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,679
And why did I get a tattoo?

550
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:17,032
My boyfriend told me to...
He was a convicted yakuza member.

551
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:23,229
That's dangerous... getting
involved with the mob like that.

552
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:32,238
I wanted anyone who could made me
forget the pressures of my career...

553
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,873
He sought me out like a wild beast.
That's why I did it.

554
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:51,272
That's what I wanted to hear!
Baring both body and soul!

555
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,470
Everyone's really getting
into it, huh

556
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:08,309
<i>Think! How'd she win like that?</i>

557
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,317
<i>Something's definitely strange...</i>

558
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,756
Wait a minute, you cheated!

559
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,478
I did no such thing!

560
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,791
Stop lying!
People's lives are at stake!

561
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,190
You marked the Honor Tiles.

562
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:31,435
That's how you got the Big Three Dragons
and the Hell Wait on the North Wind tile.

563
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,994
I've been exposed, have I?

564
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:38,358
This match is invalid!
Quickly, let those two go!

565
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,393
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

566
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,039
Why?

567
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,392
The match is already decided.

568
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:50,396
Even cheating must be forgiven if
it's discovered after the fact.

569
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,597
But that's...

570
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,036
That's the rules.

571
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,237
Let those two go!

572
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:29,078
Now why'd you go and do that,
Black Mask #13?

573
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:33,075
I was thinking of letting them go...

574
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,869
This isn't right, messing up like this!

575
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:40,753
We had another girl like you
before. Her name was Atsuko.

576
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,437
Atsuko...'?

577
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:51,473
She tried to expose my cheating.
That girl was a real pain...

578
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:55,478
sol killed her

579
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,634
<i>Atsuko... I was her guarantor.</i>

580
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:07,469
<i>Always was a blunderer, a bit slam
and careless...</i>

581
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,472
Mirai is declared the winner!

582
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,480
Congratulations.

583
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,512
Here's your $10,000,000 prize.

584
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,914
By the way, what will you use
the money for?

585
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,313
- For a match!
- H uh?

586
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,909
I am wagering it all to
challenge her to a death match.

587
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,719
Ho ho! Ah challenge from Mirai!

588
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:55,517
Yes, I accept her challenge!
I wager my outerwear. Nyan!

589
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,519
What beautiful breasts!
That wager is not a problem!

590
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:36,753
Let the final deathmatch begin!

591
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:46,238
This will be a one-on-one match using
only Bamboos, 1s, 9s, and Honors.

592
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:50,199
I, Mac Kato, will serve
as commentator:

593
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,956
Mirai, please tell us what you're
feeling now.

594
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,753
Don't bother me!

595
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,439
Ha! She's got some spirit!

596
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:13,439
<i>Final Match</i>

597
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:28,156
The die have been cast!
Last match for the panties begins.

598
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:32,638
Who will be the one to bare it all,
body and soul?

599
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,831
<i>Good! My lucky Honor tiles are here...</i>

600
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:53,631
<i>But she's onto my marking
the tiles. I have to be careful.</i>

601
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,638
<i>Ah lot of bamboos here.</i>

602
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,034
<i>But why?</i>

603
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,670
<i>That bothers me.</i>

604
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,677
Pon

605
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,675
<i>She's quickly discarding Simples.</i>

606
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:27,756
<i>May be going for AH Honors, Little
Four Winds, or Thirteen Orphans...</i>

607
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,752
<i>In any case, I have to be first
out with a complete hand.</i>

608
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:42,115
<i>OK, I'll soon get these useless
tiles out of the way...</i>

609
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,317
Pon

610
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,320
<i>Ive got the West tile!</i>

611
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,320
<i>In Tenpai for Thirteen Orphans.
Just need the Red Dragon.</i>

612
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,353
<i>I'll discard this 2 Bamboos tile.</i>

613
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,717
Pon

614
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:17,715
Whoa! That's the third time
Mirai's called "Pon!"

615
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,758
<i>What should I do?</i>

616
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:24,913
<i>If I discard this, I can get
Tenpai for AH Greens.</i>

617
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:29,114
<i>No, I risk it all for this instead.</i>

618
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:34,555
<i>What was she puzzling over?</i>

619
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:39,749
<i>Ah, she knows since I'm cheating,
I'm aiming for Thirteen Orphans,</i>

620
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,560
<i>and so couldn't discard
a Green Dragon...</i>

621
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,189
<i>Maybe she's got...</i>

622
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:50,749
<i>No, I'll draw the Red Dragon
before a Green Dragon comes up...</i>

623
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:55,759
<i>This game is already decided.</i>

624
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,753
<i>Too bad for you.</i>

625
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,392
<i>HI win with Thirteen Orphans
before I discard</i> a <i>Green Dragon</i>

626
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:06,594
<i>You missed your chance, and now
you'll lose. Nyah!</i>

627
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,597
Ron!

628
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,551
All Triplets only

629
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:34,234
Wonderful! Mirai narrowly won with a wait on the 1
Characters tile for an amazing All Triplets hand!

630
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,990
C Cup versus D Cup...

631
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,317
The winner is C cup!

632
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:41,436
How!?

633
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,990
How'd you win on a pair wait
for the 1 Characters tile'?

634
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,629
Thanks to you.

635
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,233
There's a scratch on the tile...

636
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:00,233
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

637
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,711
I did the same thing you did.

638
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:08,471
But, when!? When did you put
a scratch on the tile?

639
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,276
Mirai, please tell us what you're
feeling now.

640
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,836
Don't bother me!

641
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,879
<i>You were too focused on my tits,
weren't you?</i>

642
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,879
I had no idea you could tell
I have a breast fetish...

643
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,597
It was obvious.

644
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,480
You cheated! That's not allowed!

645
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:47,874
It is allowed! If it's uncovered
after the fact, right?

646
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,675
Those are the rules...

647
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:59,509
Atsuko... was always a blunderer,
a bit slow, and careless...

648
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,879
But she was my best friend!

649
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:11,875
Fucking bitch! That's a cheap
trick. It doesn't count!

650
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,511
Let's play one more time! One more time!

651
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,509
Freeze!

652
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,710
I've no need for sore losers.

653
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,837
It's Mac Kato's Lingerie Time!

654
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:12,153
Will the pencil snap first?
Or the panties rip first?...

655
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:13,999
Sorry!

656
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,590
Turn turn tum turn...

657
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:31,396
Hard a-port! Hard a-port!

658
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:35,156
Turn turn tum turn...

659
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,796
Turn the helm! Turn the helm!

660
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:44,194
Turn left, turn left, turn left!

661
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:47,035
Ah! That's supposed to be "right!"

662
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:50,635
Turn turn tum turn...

663
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,998
Hard a-port! Hard a-port!

664
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,000
The penis mightier!

665
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:22,679
Mightier than the panties too!

666
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,680
It's over...

667
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,475
Our new champion is born!

668
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:35,078
Under provisional rules, we've
doubled your prize to $20 million.

669
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:40,679
Now, I'd like to proceed with
an interview with our heroine.

670
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:45,869
Congratulations, that was
cheating worthy a Mahjong Queen!

671
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,669
Give it back...

672
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:53,471
Everything you took from me...
Give it back!

673
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,236
What are you talking about?

674
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:04,039
By getting naked and baring all,
you've been reborn as a new you...

675
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:09,793
Yes, but you can't bring back
those people who died!

676
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:17,155
If you bear any grudge, hold it towards your
past self who wasted her life on petty things.

677
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,919
Saying goodbye to that past...

678
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:25,278
That's what Strip Mahjong is
all about!

679
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:41,118
What did you think of this
installment?

680
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:45,956
The next contestant might be you...

681
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:50,958
...on Strip Mahjong!
Until next week!

682
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:55,114
Thanks for the mammaries!

683
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:02,154
That's a wrap, Kato!

684
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:07,109
Good work, but your way of
talking is a bit shady...

685
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,113
Hurry up and let me out of here!

686
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,758
The exit is that way.
