1
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,660
Miss Ryan?
- Yes.

2
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,115
Berlin Police department, Rudnick.

3
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,229
How do you feel?
- I'm OK.

4
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,996
What is this?

5
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,436
Your brother had this on him: Wallet,
keys, cigarettes.

6
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,398
Please, sign here.

7
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,116
There.

8
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,120
I've also put the death
certificate inside.

9
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,633
His body has been cleared by the
district attorney this morning.

10
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,794
Why did it have to be cleared?

11
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,390
Bureaucracy.

12
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,760
The autopsy showed that your brother
definitely committed suicide.

13
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,879
When can I take my brother home?

14
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,700
You have to show this
paper to your embassy.

15
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,317
There you will get a paper called
"consular mortuary certificate"

16
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,476
and then you can
organize the transport.

17
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,279
My flight leaves on Thursday.

18
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,195
If there is anything I can do for you,
call me.

19
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,237
Der Aufzug funktioniert nicht.

20
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,112
I'm sorry, I don't understand German.

21
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,238
The elevator is out of order.

22
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,193
You must be Michael's sister, Marian.

23
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,636
You two were pretty close, weren't you?

24
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,220
He was my brother!

25
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,754
Of course we were close!

26
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,671
So he would have confided in you if
something was wrong in his life?

27
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,100
What about his friends? His work?

28
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,620
Excuse me, I would like to
go up to the apartment now.

29
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,439
Oh please, let me help.

30
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,071
Thank you. Just follow me.

31
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,560
This way please.

32
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,557
There are not that many
people living here anymore.

33
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,520
They all moved out.

34
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,510
This is a very quiet house.

35
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,752
Do you really think he jumped?

36
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,519
Can I have my bags, please!?

37
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,276
Police have been known
to make mistakes.

38
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,119
Listen, this is really
none of your business.

39
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,958
OK. If you need anything,
I'm just down the hall.

40
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,036
Thank you.

41
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,157
Do you really think he jumped?

42
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,356
Do you really think he jumped?

43
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,476
Excuse me.

44
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,555
You're Michael's sister, right?

45
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,713
I saw some photos of you once.

46
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,910
He talked a lot about you.

47
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,036
You're a friend of his?

48
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,750
Something like that.

49
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,233
What's that supposed to mean?

50
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,752
Nothing. Never mind.
I'm Eric, by the way.

51
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,436
Marian.

52
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,620
Look, I'm gonna go,

53
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,620
but if you ever need to talk
or need anything, just let me know...

54
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,077
No, thank you. I'm leaving
in a few days anyway.

55
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,996
Sure.

56
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,555
Listen, I'm really sorry about your brother.
He was a good guy.

57
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,716
Thank you.

58
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,680
You have a good trip back, ok?

59
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,300
Thank you.
- Bye.

60
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,276
Bye.

61
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,876
Puh!

62
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,476
Fuck you!

63
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,676
No, fuck you!

64
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,980
Well, I ask you to do one thing one time

65
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,354
and you can't fucking do it.

66
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,079
What do you want me to fucking tell them?

67
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,196
Richard?

68
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,114
Oh... hi Mom...

69
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,080
I don't know, Mom.

70
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,710
Camera equipment, furniture,
personal stuff.

71
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,357
It's got to be worth
a small fortune, though...

72
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,836
I'm going to pack it up and
have it shipped back home...

73
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,873
No. Absolutely not.
I'm gonna go through it there...

74
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,660
Well, at least I made
the effort to come here, Mom.

75
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,909
What's your excuse?

76
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,260
No. I have to be back...

77
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,069
...by Friday at the latest...
I've got an important auction coming up.

78
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,673
Why's that suddenly so important?

79
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,700
You had absolutely no interest
for Michael when he was alive,

80
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,234
why should you care now?

81
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,270
Sorry, but this form is wrong.

82
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,556
What's wrong about it?

83
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,233
That it is not the right one...

84
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,740
So?

85
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,860
So I'm afraid you have to
go back to the mortuary

86
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,996
and get it there.

87
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,070
When? Now?

88
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,220
Sure, if you can make it in time.

89
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,435
They close in ten minutes.

90
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,914
OK, I get it tomorrow.

91
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,274
Do you know what time they open?

92
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,560
They are not open tomorrow.
You have to go there on Monday.

93
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,833
Listen, Mr. Jemison.

94
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,797
I have a flight on Thursday!

95
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,796
...sorry.

96
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,836
What are you saying?

97
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,340
That I can't take my brother home

98
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,750
because I don't have a fucking piece of paper?

99
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,717
Without that "fucking piece of paper"

100
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,357
I can't give you the consular certificate.

101
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,276
No!

102
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,798
It's sad that it has to be something
like this that brings us back together.

103
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,020
You never really hung out with
Michael when he lived here, did you?

104
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,140
No. We talked on the phone
a few times. Wanted to meet,

105
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,471
but somehow always something
came in between. I mean...

106
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,036
Hey.

107
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,956
Sorry.

108
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,873
OK, my flight's on Thursday.
But I made out a schedule on the plane.

109
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,197
We should be able to sort
out Michael's affairs.

110
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,233
It's your brother we're
talking about here.

111
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,240
I could spend four years here
and it wouldn't bring him back.

112
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,514
So much is riding on this auction...

113
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,149
I just can't afford to be away
for longer than a few days.

114
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,820
I mean, you're talking about a bunch
of paintings with frames around them.

115
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,639
What have you done,
some kind of cost benefit analysis?

116
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,360
I'm sorry. Hey, I'm sorry. Come here.

117
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,751
I need a hot bath and a bed.

118
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,100
Thank you so much for coming
here and helping me today.

119
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,076
No problem.

120
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,392
Do you think you might have some time
to come by tomorrow and help me again?

121
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,980
Well, I have got to be at the university at ten,
I got a couple of classes and...

122
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,956
Please!

123
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,836
Sure.

124
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,940
Thanks.

125
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,950
Are you gonna be alright?

126
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,356
Yeah.

127
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,796
Fuck!

128
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,476
OK.

129
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,820
You gotta auction it all off on Ebay.

130
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,559
I bet you'd make a fortune.

131
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,500
No time. I just want to get rid of it.

132
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,115
All that camera equipment, the prints...

133
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,195
Listen, if it means that much to you,
you take care of it and we'll split the earnings.

134
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,637
OK! Cool.

135
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,591
Alright, we're done.
The rest goes to the dump.

136
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,513
Do you really know the way out of here?

137
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,195
Sure. We're almost there.

138
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,199
Is this where we came from?

139
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,716
Right.

140
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,420
We're lost.

141
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,671
No, we're not. We just took a wrong turn.

142
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,396
Hi.

143
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,260
A person can really get lost
here if they don't know the way.

144
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,351
We're not lost.
- We know our way, thank you.

145
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,234
Please... Let me help
you with those boxes.

146
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,836
Shit.

147
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,193
Wow! Take a look at this!

148
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,399
This must really be worth a lot.

149
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,276
It's a comic book, it's not worth anything.

150
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,597
It's not just a comic book.

151
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,754
It's a first edition volume of "Cycle of Pain"

152
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,476
and it is worth more than you think!

153
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,876
You know, the more time that I think
about it, the lesser sense it makes.

154
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,079
I talked to Michael
three hours before he jumped

155
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,520
and there was no indication
that he was thinking of...

156
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,477
I've gone through the conversation
a thousand times in my head.

157
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,780
We all have our demons.

158
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,473
Only some can hide them
better than others.

159
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,834
Where did you get that deep wisdom?
A fucking comic book?

160
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,436
Let's see...

161
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,540
One beautiful spring day Michael Ryan,

162
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,540
a handsome young man with
the world at his feet,

163
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,740
earning a good living in a city he loves,
just says: You know what?

164
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,719
Fuck this!
I'm getting off the fucking world!

165
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,140
Hello? Richard,
where have you been?

166
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,391
I've been trying to call you for days.

167
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,556
So what's up with the deal,
did you talk to them?

168
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,398
What? Why not?

169
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,755
Richard, I'm telling you,
we're going to lose this.

170
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,158
Well, they're getting cold feet
at the last second, can't you see that?

171
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,597
No, don't talk to him,
talk to the other guy,

172
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,151
what's his name again... Yeah, right.

173
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,629
Listen, I need you to talk to them personally.

174
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,592
Tell them exactly what I told you.
Is that so hard to understand?

175
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,472
I can't. I'm not there!

176
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,593
Why not? Why can't you just get
down there and talk to them?

177
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,199
Don't mess this up, Richard!

178
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,670
Yes, right. Whatever. Bye.

179
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,717
Did you enjoy the view last night?

180
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,516
Goodbye!

181
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,556
Oh, hi Mom...

182
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,080
No, not much, I'm just cleaning up,
throwing things away...

183
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,430
I also talked to one of
Michael's clients today...

184
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,394
...no, somebody else.

185
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,820
Well, they told me that Michael
stopped working for them in December.

186
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,753
No, in December two years ago.

187
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,437
What do you mean, if he was fired?

188
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,991
Mom. He was a free-lancer...
he can't be fired.

189
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,260
Well, that he was irresponsible,

190
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,637
hard to work with, yada yada yada...

191
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,274
Yes, I went to the bank.

192
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,640
Yes, Mom, I cancelled his accounts.

193
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,793
No, nothing special.
Just the usual: rent, utilities...

194
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,800
Yes, the weather is nice.

195
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,676
...yes, I'm still here.

196
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,236
Go, go.

197
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,318
Mom, listen, I gotta go.

198
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,832
Yeah, you know what,
I'll talk to you later.

199
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,790
Yes, you too. OK, bye Mom, bye.

200
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,874
Berta 27 bitte melden.
Berta 27 bitte melden.

201
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,074
Berta 27 hört.

202
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,030
Verkehrsunfall, Uhlandstraße.
Wahrscheinlich drei Verletzte.

203
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,260
So, you're saying this box full of cash

204
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,840
is somehow connected to
your brother's death.

205
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,900
The man in these photos
lives right across the yard.

206
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,900
So?

207
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,389
Maybe my brother was
blackmailing this guy.

208
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,980
Would your brother do
something like that?

209
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,380
No, but maybe he had no choice.

210
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,995
Right. No choice.

211
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,317
That argument never fails in court.

212
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,980
And that comic painter, Eric...
- McKeen...

213
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,480
Eric McKeen.

214
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,740
Did he tell you that your
brother was blackmailing him?

215
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,860
No, of course not...

216
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,420
...so, what has he
have to do with all this?

217
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,980
I don't know. You tell me,
you're the Detective.

218
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,229
Let me see...

219
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,460
Maybe your brother was blackmailing
that Eric McKeen and maybe

220
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,260
he was tired of
making the payments

221
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,478
so he put an end to it by
putting an end to your brother.

222
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,234
Is that what you think happened?

223
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,113
Is that what you think happened?

224
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,194
You don't believe me, do you?

225
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,356
Listen,

226
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,660
I know it's hard to accept,
but your brother committed suicide.

227
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,034
He jumped

228
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,980
and there's absolutely no evidence
of aggravated assault... nothing.

229
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,100
And that's not going to change

230
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,300
just because you found some money
in a box and some nasty pictures.

231
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,940
Aren't you at least
gonna question this guy?

232
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,916
No.

233
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,355
Why not?

234
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,871
Under which charge, Miss Ryan?

235
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,516
Hi.
- Hi.

236
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,112
Can I get a white wine?

237
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,877
Just half a glass. Small.

238
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,754
Quite the showman, huh?

239
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,832
How much?
- Three Euros.

240
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,958
Hey, you know that song?

241
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,634
He coulda been an actor but
he ended up here. I want... No?

242
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,020
Thank you.

243
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,236
They probably singing it about Eric.

244
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,820
I mean, that's one talented
son of a bitch. I give him that.

245
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,752
I mean,
he could be anything he wants.

246
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,840
He could paint like a Dutch master,

247
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,100
he could probably race motorcycles...

248
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,634
He could work as a gigolo.

249
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,630
He could even work as a gigolo, you're right.

250
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,620
Are you a friend of his?

251
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,791
Partner is more like it.

252
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,756
Look,

253
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,880
see this bit

254
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,238
"Artwork by Eric McKeen"...
the Eric McKeen.

255
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,900
And now see this bit,

256
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,300
you need a magnifying glass to read it
but it says "Written by Steve Briggs".

257
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,380
I guess that would be you.

258
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,356
That would be yes.

259
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,980
That must be the "Downtrodden writer
that don't get no respect" pickup ploy.

260
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,956
Haha.

261
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,460
Eric, this is...

262
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,597
Yeah, yeah, we've met.

263
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,838
You know, I have this love-hate
relationship thing kind of going.

264
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,750
Eric creates all the beautiful,
sadistic pictures and colors them in,

265
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,380
and I write the story that
gives it all meaning.

266
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,359
He gets the glory and I pay my rent.

267
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,630
Yo Dagger!

268
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,316
Yo.
- Yo Dagger.

269
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,912
Well, it looks like Dagger's
scoped out his next victim.

270
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,474
Have you been following me?

271
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,596
Dream on.

272
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,679
Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah.

273
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,230
Can I have that Tequila please?

274
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,156
Thank you.

275
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,460
You're one tough guy, huh?

276
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,436
What?

277
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,433
Do you always get what you want?

278
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,836
Always.

279
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,839
How far are you willing to go?

280
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,115
As far as it takes.

281
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,671
So, Don Juan.
What's up with the photos?

282
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,316
Sorry?

283
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,792
What's up with the photos?

284
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,996
What photos?

285
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,634
I hate to say it, but your
brother was a peeping Tom.

286
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,069
What are you talking about?

287
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,380
You think I'm gonna invite him over so
that he can photograph me having sex?

288
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,596
Well, it's pretty obvious, isn't it?

289
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,156
Why would I do that?

290
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,476
I don't know,

291
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,912
maybe you're a sick pervert?

292
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,275
Fuck you!

293
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,431
Look you don't come here...
Who are you accusing me?

294
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,475
You don't even know me...

295
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,700
I am sorry about Michael, OK,
and it's perfectly normal

296
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,620
that you're trying to find
an excuse for his suicide...

297
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,060
...he didn't commit suicide.
- I don't know.

298
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,391
Listen, I talked to him every day.
All the time.

299
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,316
I was there for him
when he really needed me.

300
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,196
I am sure you were.

301
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,556
Listen, I think you start
chasing windmills.

302
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,072
It's like Freud said,
sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

303
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,033
And you haven't seen
him in how long?

304
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,075
I'm not trying to lay a guilt trip
on you or anything like that.

305
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,180
But it's pretty hard to tell
what's going on in somebody's head

306
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,839
from five thousand miles away.

307
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,716
Maybe you're right.

308
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,796
Nightcap?

309
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,276
That's not that bad.

310
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,996
Who painted it?

311
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,036
Me.

312
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,700
Sorry. It's not bad at all.

313
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,040
You're a connoisseur.

314
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,433
Actually I just see dollar signs.

315
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,635
I work for an auctioning house.
I'm not the creative type.

316
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,356
I doubt that.

317
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,436
Listen,

318
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,140
you're gonna have to do
a bit better than that.

319
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,992
Just getting started. C'mon.

320
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,314
You know what... It's late.
I'm gonna go home.

321
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,876
Have a good night.

322
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,395
You don't really think
I killed your brother, do you?

323
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,876
Who is this?

324
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,916
Nobody.

325
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,633
Do you think he has a girlfriend?

326
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,156
I know her.

327
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,156
What do you mean, you know her?

328
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,880
She's a friend of
yours or something?

329
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,870
She is an actress.

330
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,317
She's famous.
She's on TV all the time.

331
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,276
She sucks.

332
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,996
That's her car.

333
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,340
You sure you wanna do this?

334
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,999
... yes, I am.
- OK.

335
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,116
Was machen Sie hier?

336
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,358
You must be Mrs. Reinhardt...

337
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,900
Who are you?

338
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,480
I'm sorry. I was hoping
that you could help me...

339
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,914
Where did you get this?

340
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,595
Greetings from our mutual artist friend.

341
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,710
Since when does Eric send women?

342
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,238
Is he too frightened to do
the dirty work himself?

343
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,311
You tell Eric and his photographer
friend they'd better be careful.

344
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,635
Sybille, kommst du bitte noch mal,
wir wollen weitermachen.

345
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,276
Ich komm gleich.

346
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,440
Tell Eric, if he thinks he can get
more money he can forget it.

347
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,980
And you can also tell him

348
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,596
if even one of these photos
will be in a newspaper, ever,

349
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,830
I will kill him.

350
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,640
Do you understand me?

351
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,276
Yes, Ma'm.

352
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,151
And now get off the property.

353
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,596
Let's go.

354
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,035
Who does he think I am?

355
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,597
I can't believe he just lied
to me. Like... just...

356
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,870
Listen, I told you everything, right.

357
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,560
Now, I go there,
he lies to me completely. Oh God,

358
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,275
he's not gonna get away with this.

359
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,900
Who does he think I am?

360
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,515
Some little country girl
or what the hell?

361
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,260
Hi.

362
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,475
You blackmailed her!

363
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,276
Come on in.

364
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,511
Hello, there!
- Hi.

365
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,180
You guys have met, right?
- Yeah.

366
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,020
Yeah.

367
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,554
Would you like something to drink?
- No.

368
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,359
How is it going?
- Good.

369
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,980
Steve's just telling me about
his idea for the next volume.

370
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,314
Right, and then this particularly young
woman, she decides to take a bubble bath.

371
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,780
And she's lying there in the water,
she's all soapy and sexy

372
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,940
and very slim...

373
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,794
...and she's lying in the hot water
and she's got her eyes closed

374
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,840
and she's dreaming and it's all still

375
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,580
and then the Dagger breaks in,

376
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,300
and he slashes her up,
and he rips her to pieces,

377
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,200
and then he has sex with her
corpse on the bathroom floor.

378
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,996
Pretty evil, ha?

379
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,700
That's not evil, that's sick.

380
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,836
Well, c'mon, think about it.

381
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,780
Think how many issues we'd sell.

382
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,031
Way more than we've
ever sold before.

383
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,634
What. Why you're
looking at me like that?

384
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,559
Can I talk to you...?

385
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,916
Yeah. Go ahead.

386
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,076
...in private!

387
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,196
Steve,
could you take a little walk please.

388
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,154
I'm not. C'mon.

389
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,876
Just fucking do it!

390
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,916
Fine.

391
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,675
Yo Dagger.

392
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,555
So, what's the story
with Frau Reinhardt?

393
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,352
She actually volunteered to pay.

394
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,994
Money is not a big
problem for her.

395
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,919
You are a fucking liar.

396
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,596
Believe it or not,

397
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,596
she seduced me.

398
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,390
She was bored stiff,

399
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,359
so we were hanging out for a while
and your brother snapped the photos.

400
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,152
Then it was just a
matter of negotiations.

401
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,230
The tabloids would offer
10.000 Euro for a photo...

402
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,220
and Sybille was willing
to pay one cent more.

403
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,640
And was she the only one?

404
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,398
You lured him into this!

405
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,153
It was his idea, not mine.

406
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,480
You already lied to me once.
Why should I believe you?

407
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,559
Look, your brother was desperate, OK?

408
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,437
He wanted to put on a big exhibit of all
of his work. He needed to get backing.

409
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,872
I had seen he was a
talented son of a bitch.

410
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,760
I gave him the money.

411
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,993
He got great reviews.

412
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,675
But nobody was buying,

413
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,680
it was a disaster.

414
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,075
And there we were, broke.

415
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,596
So?

416
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,631
So Michael came to my apartment
one day with his idea.

417
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,111
A simple plan for simple people.

418
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,035
If I would have said no, he wouldn't have
gone through with it. But I said yes.

419
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,396
End of story.

420
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,551
What if they blackmailed
the wrong woman.

421
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,318
What if somebody put out
a contract on Michael.

422
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,276
What do you think?

423
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,992
You really want to
know what I think?

424
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,076
Sign this!

425
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,278
Äh, wie lange dauert das ungefähr noch?

426
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,460
Puh, das kommt jetzt
erst mal ins Fach und dann...

427
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,820
Can you ask her how long it will take?

428
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,796
She doesn't know.

429
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,635
Danke.

430
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,196
When is your flight again?

431
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,396
I'm extending my stay.

432
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,759
Just a couple more days.

433
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,514
Yess! OK, let's do some
serious partying tonight.

434
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,700
I'm talking about some drinks,
some clubbing...

435
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,860
and some hot looking guys

436
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,340
to squeeze the orange
juice out of for breakfast.

437
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,999
Just like old times.
- Yeah.

438
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,796
Hi.

439
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,759
Oh hello.
- Hi.

440
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,900
How are you doing?

441
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,354
Good, good, how are you?

442
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,916
Hey, hon,
I want you to meet somebody.

443
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,020
Steve, I want you to meet
a good friend of mine, Susann.

444
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,918
Hi.
- Hi, Steve Briggs.

445
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,956
Susann, Steve makes comics.

446
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,140
Wait a second.

447
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,980
The "Cycle of Pain" Steve Briggs?

448
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,116
The very same.

449
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,439
That comic is totally sick!

450
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,558
I'll take that as a compliment then.

451
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,278
Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

452
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,700
In issue number seven, when Dagger
is behind that big oak tree?

453
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,074
You're a big fan?

454
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,340
Can I have your babies, please?

455
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,660
Oh, right now?

456
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,399
Or do you want to dance first?

457
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,599
The Chinese masters used to say

458
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,273
that when they were gonna die they
were gonna inhabit their artwork.

459
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,756
Yeah?

460
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,234
But... cool, he?

461
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:46,800
And the Dagger he has tattoos in
places that defy imagination.

462
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,140
But I don't expect that you are the kind
of people that go looking for them.

463
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,278
Well, I'm gonna go looking for them...

464
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,140
Hey, where are you going?

465
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,311
Honey, I'm so tired,
I'm gonna go home.

466
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,235
I'm coming with you.
- No, no, no. You stay here.

467
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,274
Have a good time.

468
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,116
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

469
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,396
Bye.

470
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,636
Yo Dagger.

471
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,469
Do you need any help?

472
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:58,075
"We came at the agreed
time but no answer.

473
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,440
"Please call. Urgent."

474
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,233
Any friends of yours?

475
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,153
No. It's the moving company.

476
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,596
I'll call them.

477
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,760
Your brother did not have many friends.

478
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,640
But he was a nice neighbor.

479
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,396
Thank you.

480
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,429
I hate to intrude, but...
haven't you found anything strange...

481
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,030
I mean... didn't you find it
strange that Michael...

482
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,360
I mean why the window?

483
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,234
Let's face it, the height is critical

484
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,715
if you're a jumper.

485
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,900
We're pretty high on this floor

486
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,151
but it's still not a sure thing.

487
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,715
He could have jumped from the roof,
no problem.

488
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,980
You mean... you don't
think that is was a...

489
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,956
Suicide?

490
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:50,996
No way.

491
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,919
No way. No way.

492
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,556
Nightcap?

493
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,473
Still hot on the killer's trail?

494
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,513
No, I'm taking the night off.

495
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,596
That's a nice dress.

496
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,156
Well, thank you.

497
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,275
I'm glad you like it.

498
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,990
Haven't had a chance to wear it yet.

499
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,798
So what's the special occasion?

500
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,313
Oh, nothing...

501
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,440
I just saw you... working over here.

502
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,915
So I thought I'd just
come over and say Hi.

503
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,071
Hi.
- Hi.

504
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,399
Hey guys, how's it going?

505
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,077
No problem. We have
everything under control.

506
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,074
Right...

507
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,514
So, comic book groupie. How was it?

508
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,180
Mezzo-mezzo.

509
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,476
Oh come on, out with it.

510
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,117
He's a writer. What do you think?

511
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,590
Well, I had sex with the artist...

512
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,196
No way.

513
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,356
Way...

514
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,553
I mean, when, where?

515
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,157
Well, last night obviously,

516
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:30,520
after you and that Chinese master
were making out on that couch.

517
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,476
How was it?

518
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,516
This is ridiculous.

519
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,994
You are the one with all
the conspiracy theories.

520
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,150
Here is some more.

521
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,596
Cool.

522
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,780
Listen, I trade you all of these
if you'll give me back the Frank Miller

523
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,712
I sold you last month.

524
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,720
Hmm, how do I say this delicately?

525
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,112
No!
- Ok, that's all.

526
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,594
You collect this crap?

527
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,595
I bet my comic collection

528
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:27,560
has increased its value more since
9-11 than your stock portfolio.

529
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,380
Ehm? What does that say again?

530
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,632
"29-year-old Hungarian
stewardess murdered"...

531
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,396
Here.

532
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,994
So what's that supposed to prove?

533
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,078
Wouldn't you say this is just a little
bit more than a coincidence?

534
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,591
C'mon, you don't really think that
Eric killed this woman, do you?

535
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,660
I mean, inspiration, sure,

536
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,399
but these are just drawings.

537
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:02,110
To tell you the truth,
this scares the shit out of me.

538
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:07,940
I mean, I thought you were a bit out
of it with Michael's death and everything.

539
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,873
But now I think we
should talk to the cops.

540
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,476
So who is she?

541
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,356
I don't know.

542
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:45,956
Do you know that she's dead?

543
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,116
Yes.

544
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,876
So who was she?

545
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,637
Another one of the women
that you were blackmailing?

546
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,480
She was a stewardess I met on a flight.

547
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,839
Did you go to the police?

548
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,396
Why not?

549
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,460
Because if I go to the police...

550
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,154
...they will start asking you questions
about all the women you blackmailed.

551
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,432
Yes. All the women I blackmailed.
Me and your brother.

552
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,820
Look. I didn't kill Michael
and I didn't kill this girl.

553
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,435
I might be a sick bastard,
but I am not a killer.

554
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,553
Do you have any idea who's doing this?

555
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,596
I don't know. Some copycat killer?

556
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,030
She's missing, too.

557
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,156
Since when?

558
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,074
Since the night your brother died.

559
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,793
Nacht.
- Nacht.

560
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,235
What if Michael photographs Eric with that
red-haired popstar to blackmail her?

561
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,740
Maybe Eric gets a bit too rough.
He kills Maria.

562
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,231
Eric sees Michael taking pictures and
realizes he has to kill your brother, too.

563
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,916
Wait a second, she's not dead.
She is just missing!

564
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,116
"Missing", right.

565
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,500
Michael died the same day
this Maria disappeared.

566
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,510
What more do you want?

567
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,271
Eric has slept with these women.
Now they're dead.

568
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,636
Not me.

569
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,911
You didn't go and fall
in love with him, did you?

570
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,835
What about that weird guy next door?

571
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:17,151
What's his name again... Bergen.

572
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,560
He's strange enough.

573
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,516
What you're doing is called
breaking and entering.

574
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,239
I just want to find out whether
he has anything to do with this.

575
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:41,112
If he's got nothing to hide,
he's got nothing to worry about, right?

576
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,830
You know what?

577
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,355
I've been studying psychology
for seven years now.

578
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,620
And I don't have the foggiest idea
what kind of problem this guy has.

579
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,960
Oh my God.

580
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,671
Give me the flashlight.
I wanna check something out.

581
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,036
The window. See if anyone's coming.

582
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,314
Are you nuts? He could see that.

583
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,636
Marian.

584
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,756
He's coming!

585
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,394
Give me another minute!

586
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,793
Marian!
- I'm almost done.

587
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,476
Let's go.

588
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,353
C'mon.

589
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,000
Does that say what I think it does?

590
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,515
She's dead.

591
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,759
It's time to talk to Rudnick.

592
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,919
Ich will Ihnen das erklären...

593
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:36,916
Bergen's the one.

594
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,340
Bergen? You mean Michael's neighbor?
- Yes.

595
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,340
He's a loser! He's not capable.

596
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,194
Listen, he's a copycat killer, just like you said.

597
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,980
He's obsessed with your comics

598
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,940
and he's been acting out the stories.

599
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,599
He's a total psychopath.

600
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,393
I think you've been reading
too many comic books.

601
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,900
And I think if you weren't so hot

602
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,300
on showing pictures of girls
getting shredded to death,

603
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,660
because it sells more comics,

604
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,479
maybe a couple of your one-night
stands might still be alive.

605
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,472
It's not about selling more comic books.

606
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:15,237
But maybe you're right. Maybe I just
didn't realize the consequences.

607
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,780
What are you talking about?

608
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,060
That I should have stopped the moment
I realized that they were dying

609
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,753
after they appeared in the comic books.

610
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,389
So why didn't you?

611
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:26,796
I don't know.

612
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,620
Maybe I just didn't want
to give up the thing that

613
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:33,395
I had worked for my entire life just because
I had a little bit of blood on my hands?

614
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,635
Maybe I realized that I was never
gonna be a real painter?

615
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,475
I'm stuck in a rut?

616
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:44,557
Or... I just want everybody to like me
in the end? I don't know. You tell me.

617
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,719
Who said you are not a real painter?

618
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,476
Whatever.

619
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,713
The thing is I have to
still fulfill my contract.

620
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:00,156
But... Steve's not gonna like it...
This is the last issue.

621
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,200
You remember the story he was telling...

622
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,180
The one about the girl getting
slashed to death in a bathtub?

623
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,395
Yes.
- Yes.

624
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,516
I changed it.

625
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,430
In the end there is a twist of fate...

626
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,716
It's called redemption.

627
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,076
What?

628
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,236
What?

629
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,954
I can't hear you.

630
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,540
Berta 27 bitte kommen.
Berta 27 bitte kommen.

631
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,550
Mr. Bergen?

632
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,640
An alle Einheiten.

633
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,879
I found your note.

634
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,195
Berta 31 verstanden.

635
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,034
Müssen wir die Straße sperren?

636
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:29,000
Berta 31 ist unterwegs.
Wir schauen uns das an.

637
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,352
Berta 31. Ende.

638
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,030
Mr. Bergen?

639
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,957
Berta 10 an Berta 31.

640
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,310
You wanted to talk to me.

641
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:54,800
Berta 31 hört.

642
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,920
Verkehrsunfall mit drei Fahrzeugen.

643
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,500
Wahrscheinlich Verletzte.

644
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,476
Mr. Bergen?

645
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,990
Oh my God!

646
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,959
Miss Ryan, are you there? It's Rudnick.

647
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:58,475
Well, how long is "not very long".

648
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,660
Two minutes? A half hour? A whole century?

649
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:04,636
I don't know,

650
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,800
long enough to run home, lock the door,

651
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,037
call you guys and wait
for you to get here.

652
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,795
And when we arrived everything
was magically back to normal.

653
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,460
Thank you Miss Ryan, that will be all.
No more questions.

654
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,834
Listen, don't patronize me.

655
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,380
Bergen was here.

656
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,437
I saw him, and he was dead.

657
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,300
And there's somebody running around
pretending to be a serial killer!

658
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,880
A serial killer, wow?

659
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,420
I know what I saw.

660
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:38,150
I had a meeting this morning with Bergen
at the station. He didn't show up.

661
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,660
He's an investigative journalist.

662
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,780
He's been in every shithole in
this world and ended up in Berlin.

663
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,314
Wait a second. He's a journalist?

664
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,793
He said he knew your brother.

665
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,432
I think I'll ask him next time I see him.

666
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,878
You're not gonna see
him again, he's dead.

667
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,272
Look, Eric has slept with these women.

668
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,433
He's used them as illustrations
and now they're dead.

669
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,710
You didn't go and fall
in love with him, did you?

670
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,917
I think you might be
right about the comics.

671
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:43,952
Well, I found some photos that Michael
must have taken right before he died.

672
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,260
Listen, I need to go down to the
basement and check something out.

673
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,112
I don't wanna go by myself.

674
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,396
Thank you. OK. See you!

675
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,593
Are you really sure you wanna do this?

676
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,310
Yes, I am.

677
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,634
Are you coming, or what?

678
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,540
Let's get the hell out of here right now.

679
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,279
I'm right behind you.

680
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:47,116
Entschuldigung.

681
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,477
Miss Ryan, can you come
with me to the station?

682
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,356
We have to clear up some questions.

683
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:59,230
Yeah, it's not a problem.
Just give me a minute.

684
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,039
They want me to go to the station.

685
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,315
Hey, come on...

686
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,552
The storeroom belongs to him, right?

687
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,716
That's right.

688
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:19,398
He says it was just rough sex.

689
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,356
Afterwards, she asked if
she could spend the night.

690
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,871
He left for an appointment
and when he got back she was gone.

691
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,438
He says he hasn't been down
to his cellar in two years.

692
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,199
Did he tell you about the blackmail?

693
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,556
Miss Ryan.

694
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:34,836
Thank you.

695
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,800
He's free to go?

696
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,220
Hey. I'm just a cop.

697
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:51,551
I'm the one who puts em behind bars.
It's the judges who let them go.

698
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,353
And he's got a very good lawyer.

699
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,519
Can I get police protection?

700
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:01,154
If you want to sleep here at the station, sure.
Otherwise....I have no manpower.

701
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,340
What's this?

702
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:10,389
The certificate. They sent it over
from the embassy this morning.

703
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,353
You can take your brother home.

704
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,076
I'm sorry.

705
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,998
Listen, I'm getting out of the apartment.

706
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,875
Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean
you're getting out of the apartment?

707
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,673
That's not a great idea, honey.
- I got a flight for tomorrow morning

708
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,391
and I'm not staying here another second.

709
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,020
You can stay at my place.

710
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,020
I'll pick you up, OK?

711
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,020
No, no, honey,
you don't have to do that.

712
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,191
Marian...
- I can stay at a hotel, really.

713
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,100
Listen to me.
Just stay where you are.

714
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,940
Don't move until I get there.

715
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,940
I'm gonna pick you up
in ten minutes, just stay!

716
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,236
Alright. OK, I'll see you soon. Bye.

717
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,236
Marian?

718
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,196
Marian?

719
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,400
Marian, what happened?

720
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,957
Hey, it's me, Susann.
Open the door.

721
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:26,278
Hey, open up. Come on.

722
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:31,396
No.
- Hey...

723
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,116
Susann?

724
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:41,956
Susann?

725
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,516
Susann!!

726
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:19,193
Come on, come on.

727
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,872
Come on...

728
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,434
Marian, Marian, Marian. Hey....

729
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,020
What are you doing?
Why don't you kill me now?

730
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,340
What are you talking about?
- Get off me...

731
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,316
Hey...

732
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,952
Just c'mon...

733
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,750
Shit!

734
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:33,510
Are you ready?

735
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:14,833
Ok, Eric, this is the part
where life imitates art.

736
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:19,672
Are you ready to
become immortal, Eric?

737
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:22,315
That's what this is about,
you crazy fuck.

738
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,780
If you touch her,
I'm gonna kill you.

739
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,793
Oh, don't worry.
You won't survive this either.

740
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,469
But if you don't mind,
I'm gonna start with her first.

741
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,710
You and me, we still got
a lot to talk about.

742
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:52,876
Shit!

743
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,834
Why do you take the shit you
write so personally, huh?

744
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,833
You're a joke, Steve!

745
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,100
Every kid can understand
the shit you scribble.

746
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,431
It's all teenage masturbation
fantasies and power trips

747
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,820
so they can get the kicks.
It's only comic, Steve, it's only comic.

748
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,180
Don't you get it, Eric?
Even you, don't you get it?

749
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,520
God, get a life...

750
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,391
Yeah, just give me a minute.

751
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,192
You fuck. Fucking asshole!

752
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:30,675
Marian, he's coming!

753
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:46,516
Hello there.

754
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,597
I know what you're thinking, Marian:

755
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,677
"This guy ever written a book?

756
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,278
"A newspaper article?

757
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,557
"Published a poem?"

758
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:05,319
No, you're right. I haven't.

759
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,100
And maybe I was just lucky

760
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:11,660
that I met this Eric Mc-Artsy-Fartsy.

761
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:14,780
This great guy who can
draw this beautiful characters

762
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,220
with such passion and flair.

763
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:18,959
A "true artist".

764
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,232
I'd be nothing without him, right?

765
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,680
Anyone else can do it just as well.

766
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,670
You know what? You're wrong!

767
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,869
And even if you were right, even if,

768
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,438
I wouldn't give a shit,
because you'll be dead in a minute.

769
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:38,634
By the way.
I'm sorry about your brother.

770
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:45,119
Well, as sorry as anyone can be
for someone who's really fucked up.

771
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,359
It's not really my fault that he's dead.

772
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:53,480
I mean, if you want someone
to blame, blame the redhead!

773
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,760
I mean, I went through all the trouble

774
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,860
of calling up Eric and
making some lame excuse

775
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:03,260
and getting him to leave the house

776
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:06,000
and she... stayed!

777
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:14,397
I mean, what kind of a guest stays,
once the host has left? Hm?

778
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,672
That's just fucking rude!

779
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:26,836
It's rude, Marian. Rude!

780
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,914
Oh, c'mon, Marian.
Are you hiding in here?

781
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,276
Marian?

782
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,153
Marian?

783
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:56,910
Marian, where are you?

784
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,511
Fuck, I'm looking forward to killing you!
