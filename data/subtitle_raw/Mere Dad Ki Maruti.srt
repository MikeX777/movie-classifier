1
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,919
Excuse me, mister,
please take me to sector 9.

2
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,920
It's so hot.

3
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,839
It's Raj.

4
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,718
Baby, why are you
travelling in a rickshaw?

5
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,398
It's thanks to Sameer!
He's such an ass.

6
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:18,238
He was supposed to pick me up
from the salon two hours ago...

7
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,120
and as usual he's ditched me.

8
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,279
Why am I not surprised?

9
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,319
He's got no control

10
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,798
Anyway, I was wondering...
for the wedding,

11
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,798
should I keep an Iron Man
frenchie or a Dabaang moustache?

12
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,398
What do you think?
- Baby!

13
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:35,118
On our wedding night I'm not
interested in getting acupressure done.

14
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,118
Ok... tell me, how are the
wedding preparations going?

15
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,958
Mom has turned into Lady Gaga..

16
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,878
...and is driving everyone
crazy with her policing.

17
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,160
And you know how dad is...

18
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:45,959
I think he's negotiating
discounts even in his sleep!

19
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:53,479
In short our Khullar house has
turned into a complete madhouse!

20
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,318
Excuse me, are these decorations
worthy of a bungalow in Sector 9?

21
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,038
Is my only daughter getting married..

22
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,438
...using plastic
chairs at her reception?

23
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,718
Obviously not, right?

24
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,960
Make sure I don't see them
in Shivalik Farms or else!

25
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:06,039
Come on, get on with it!

26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,078
Dear God! Stop will you! How many
times do I have to repeat myself?

27
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:11,278
You have to start playing the
dhols just when the car arrives!

28
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:12,638
Not before... enough already.

29
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,200
Tanvi, my baby. I sent
Sameer to pick you up hours ago.

30
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:17,399
Morning, aunty.

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,798
I really think you should
be very strict with Sameer.

32
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:21,520
See how he's left
Tanvi stranded yet again.

33
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:29,521
By the way, Tanvi darling, did
Sameer tell you where he is?

34
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,799
Go!!!! Step on it, dude!

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,679
I wish I could drive all day

36
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,639
I wish I could make you
sit next to me all day

37
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,758
Change the track, turn up the sound

38
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,398
Change my gear, let's go round

39
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:09,520
Don't say that, thought you was down

40
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,519
Everyone's fond of her Oh

41
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,519
Everyone loves her. Oh

42
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,439

She fills my heart Oh

00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,159
She is one of a kind She is so smart

47
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,039
Oh

48
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,639

Am feeling that

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,279
She's sexy tight

52
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,359
I'm feeling that Oh

53
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,279

Take a drive in the sunshine
Look at this city, it's all mine

58
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:51,479
I got the big doh on it

59
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,279
And the ladies want it

60
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,640
It's the capital city

61
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:56,959
So beautiful, not nitty gritty

62
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,999
I put my foot down on it

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,079
Mohali chronic

64
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,359
Pound for pound

65
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,198
Now we're racing with some clowns

66
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,000
Put your arms up for the clouds

67
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:08,439
Girl, have no doubt Oh

She's sitting tight, next to me

75
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,719
She's flying high, next to me

76
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,999

Pick up the speed.

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,679
Pick up the speed.

84
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,479
Ride the breeze

85
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,399
Pick up the speed.

Ride the breeze

89
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,839
Pick up the speed.

90
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,879

She is so smart Oh

98
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,558
Jackass, you have five hundred
thousand missed calls from your dad.

99
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,838
And by now he must
have called my house!

100
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,718
And you know how crazy my dad gets
when he switches into his army mode

101
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:29,358
He's going to kick
my ass thanks to you.

102
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:32,678
Gattu my bro, have you ever
wondered why your name rhymes with Fattu

103
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,958
Sameer my bro, have you ever wondered

104
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,280
why your Tej is
always hunting for you?

105
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:39,079
You know Tej, don't you?

106
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,278
Come here. Should I slap you?

107
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,678
Dog.
- Right or left?

108
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:43,918
Come lick my shoe.
- Stupid buffoon.

109
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,478
Why you keeping quiet?
- Bloody Idiot.

110
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,160
Why the hell are you quiet?
- You want a slap?

111
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:49,799
You shut up and answer me. Eat shit.

112
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,158
You want to eat shit?
- Shalu, give him a plate of shit.

113
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,080
Wow, you really made me proud today!

114
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:55,799
Beating.
- Sameer...

115
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,199
Idiot
- Sameer...

116
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,959
Get out Sameeeeeeeeer!

117
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,839
Sameer! You stupid buffoon.

118
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,960
Are you dead? Where the hell
are you? You come here right now!

119
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:08,319
Where have you been
loafing around this time?

120
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,439
Moron.

121
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,518
Come here, I said!
Dad, I'm not coming.

122
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,998
You're only interested
in squeezing my ears

123
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,278
and making a lemonade for yourself.

124
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,920
Come on Teju, we are all
getting ready for a wedding!

125
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:18,159
Please let it go.

126
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,560
Is he doing his board
exams that I should let it go?

127
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:22,079
Useless burger

128
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,199
Dad, it's bugger, not burger.

129
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,040
Shut up. So now you're going
to teach me English are you?

130
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:31,199
I told you ten times to go and
pick up my trousers from the tailor.

131
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,760
Did you do it? Now
am I to wear boxers..

132
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:35,319
...under my jacket and prance around?

133
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,479
Give me the receipt.

134
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,239
What receipt?

135
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,959
You good-for-nothing!

136
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,278
Sameer, you go and
pour oil in the lamps.

137
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,598
From one side to the other.
Go, son! Quickly!

138
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:48,078
Shalu, where the hell
did you produce him from?

139
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,158
I'm sure he got
switched in the hospital.

140
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,798
He loses everything! Why
don't you get lost sometimes?

141
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:54,998
Please will you do that for me?

142
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:58,280
Now I know why some
animals eat their own children!

143
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:03,279
Gross. - Bloody dog. I waited for
two hours in the parlour for you.

144
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,718
Are you getting
married today? Are you?

145
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:06,558
Why are you getting so excited?
- Thank god.

146
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,398
At least I won't have to see your
ugly face every day in the morning.

147
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,598
Oh shut up! Have you
ever taken a good..

148
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:12,200
...look at your ugly
face in the mirror?

149
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:13,799
Bloody dog!
- Moron!

150
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,998
Go to hell!
- You go to hell!

151
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:18,438
Kuljit, did you go all the way to
South India to get me one coconut?

152
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,718
Can you hurry please! Give it to me.

153
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:23,118
Why does everyone want to
break coconuts? What's going on?

154
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:25,638
Son, in reality I would
much rather break your head..

155
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,520
...but I'll make do
using a coconut instead.

156
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:30,599
Do us a favor, go get lost somewhere.

157
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,718
Dad, for crying out loud,
please put your jokes on shuffle.

158
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:33,920
Check on your weight first, your
tummy is increasing day by day.

159
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:38,439
Bloody idiot!

160
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Thank you, thank you!

161
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,958
Wow Dad! New Maruti Ertiga.

162
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,398
And that too, top end! Is this ours?

163
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,878
No, no, I bought it
for our neighbours!

164
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,880
Aww, Dad! I always misjudged you.

165
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:34,759
Silly. Don't touch the car.

166
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,919
Step away from it.

167
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,518
Come on, dad, if I step away
from the car how will I drive?

168
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,398
It's obviously not that automatic.

169
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,158
Don't play dumb you
planet of the apes!

170
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,200
I haven't bought this car
for your loafing around!

171
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:50,079
This is a wedding present for my
daughter and my future son-in-law.

172
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,199
What! This car is
for Raj? Is he serious?

173
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,240
Mom he is so un-cool, he doesn't
even know where the Gehri route is!

174
00:08:56,241 --> 00:09:03,319
Hey, did you know, our very first
car was a small little Maruti 800.

175
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,518
So? - We brought Tanvi and you
home from the hospital in it...

176
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,398
Then on our 10th anniversary I
gave my wife Shalu a Maruti Swift.

177
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,718
Remember, Shalu?
- Of course I remember!

178
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,280
And now for Tanvi's wedding
I am giving Raj and Tanvi..

179
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:21,559
...this beautiful Maruti Ertiga.

180
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,559
Isn't it great!

181
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,319
I can't believe you guys!

182
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,038
I'm obviously not your son. Have
you ever given me a cycle even?

183
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,918
First, grow up! Become a man.

184
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:33,638
Then let's see if
you deserve anything.

185
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,118
Okay, Dad fine. I will never
forget this day. Just wait and watch.

186
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:38,918
One day I'll line up cars in front
of you. You just wait and watch.

187
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,400
Are you planning on
working in the Maruti showroom?

188
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:45,319
Dad! Daddy!

189
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,799
Wow, new car.

190
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Wow.

191
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,119
Why is your network down today?

192
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,439
Tej has bought a new car.

193
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,159
Tej?

194
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,560
Really? Like seriously?

195
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:59,679
Yes. He's bought a red Ertiga,
fully loaded.

196
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,279
Then why are we in a rickshaw, dude?

197
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,240
Because that car is not for me!

198
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:06,559
What? Who is it for then?

199
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,199
The one Tej loves the most, and
wishes that I were more like him!

200
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,744
For Raj?

201
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,838
My whole life everyone has
wanted me to be more like Raj.

202
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,598
Gattu bro, had I been
like that loser Raj,

203
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:22,838
the car would have been mine!

204
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,078
Do you think I look cool in
this rickshaw? - Hell, no!

205
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,958
No wonder Jasleen never looks at me!

206
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,958
Dude, she never looks at you anyway!

207
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:32,598
You've been window-shopping for
a year and feeling sentimental.

208
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,318
She doesn't even know your name.

209
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:38,400
Gattu, only a monkey can climb
a tree and that monkey is me.

210
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:41,399
Yeah, right!
- Stop talking shit.

211
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,119
Daljit, that builder!

212
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,918
I'll slide and unlock him one day.

213
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,518
Flies enter his mouth,
whenever he opens it.

214
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,238
I wonder what Jasleen sees in him!

215
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,798
He has a sports car, dude.

216
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,238
And Raj has an Ertiga.

217
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:52,680
Why do all these
undeserving people in..

218
00:11:52,681 --> 00:12:00,681
...the world get the
best things in life?

219
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,079
Please listen. Please, baby.

220
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,200
Stop it, Daljit. Don't
act as if you care for me.

221
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:10,759
Acting? Why would I act?

222
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,159
I seriously love you.

223
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,159
You want to wear short dresses,
right? Fine. No problem.

224
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,079
But only in front of me! That's all.

225
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,360
Daljit, do you love me?

226
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:25,319
Yes I do!

227
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,638
Do you think I am hot?

228
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,200
Smoking hot, sweetheart.

229
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:29,479
And my legs?

230
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,760
They are the world's hottest legs!
- Really?

231
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:33,479
- Absolutely! Exactly!

232
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,160
So why should I be unfair to the
world and hide my lovely legs!

233
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:38,559
♪ K Thanks Bye!

234
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,839
Oh lord!

235
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,278
I would've never let
her hide her legs.

236
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,838
Such epic legs should be display pics!

237
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,520
Why worry if they are waxed!

238
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:47,039
Guts!
- Just!!

239
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,798
Baby, baby! Just listen, please!

240
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,120
If your decision to
break up is final..

241
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:54,639
...then at least do it
after tonight's party.

242
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,318
Last minute, neither
of us will get dates.

243
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:57,558
We will have to go alone!

244
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,958
Alone?! And me? You will go alone!

245
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,640
I am Chandigarh's Shakira!

246
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:08,641
I never go to a party alone!

247
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:34,440
My hips might but my lips don't lie.

248
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,759
Pick me up at ten.

249
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,199
Bye.

250
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,399
Madam pen?

251
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,319
4, 6...

252
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,679
Is that four?

253
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,639
Hello, who's this?

254
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,120
Hi Jasleen, it's Sameer.

255
00:13:56,121 --> 00:13:59,799
Which one? Puri, Khanna or Randhawa?

256
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,520
It's Sammer, err, Khullar.

257
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:04,999
Sameer err Khullar, do I know you?

258
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,598
Jasleen, you gave me
your number today, remember?

259
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,920
You wrote your name on
my hand with a felt pen

260
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:13,879
and I really felt a
solid connection between us.

261
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,759
So.
- So?

262
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,278
So, where do I come at ten?

263
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,478
Where do I come
- Meaning?

264
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:20,440
You told me pick to
pick you up at ten!

265
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:22,319
Hello! Are you psychic?

266
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,679
You mean psycho?

267
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,918
Same difference, only...

268
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:27,278
Please don't say no, Jasleen. Please!
Please! Only one date.

269
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,560
It's Jazzlin. - Err, Jas,
Jazzlin. Please don't refuse!

270
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:32,559
Please, Jazzlin! Please. K.

271
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,759
Please don't refuse!
Please, Jazzlin! Please.

272
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:44,760
I said K.

273
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,359
Tacky! What if she's just fooling you?

274
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,878
What if you get stood up?

275
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:57,640
You know the reputation of
the hostel girls, right?

276
00:14:57,641 --> 00:15:02,119
Gattu, don't burst my dream bubble.

277
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,880
Okay, fine. She's agreed for now...

278
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:07,759
how will you impress her further?

279
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,304
Tell me?

280
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,038
No way. No flipping way, Sameer.
- Yes way, Gattu.

281
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,280
Have you ever seen a hero impressing
a girl on a local transport bus?

282
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:21,879
CTU Bus?

283
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,998
I'll take the new car out sometime.

284
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:25,838
I'll come back and parallel park.

285
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,160
No one will know...

286
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:35,161
The entire Khullar madhouse is
busy with the wedding preparations.

287
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Mom is teaching Tanvi how to dance.

288
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:40,799
She and all our cousins are busy..

289
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,640
...practicing their
1,2,3,4's all evening.

290
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:48,119
She's planning a
performance for loser Raj.

291
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,119
Breaking News

292
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,480
Car thieves now steal
cars dressed as the police.

293
00:15:52,481 --> 00:16:00,481
These car thieves are
duping innocent people.

294
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,479
Bye, Granny.

295
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:16,239
Uncles get drunk and
curse the corrupt government.

296
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,799
From top to bottom, all the
government officials are corrupt.

297
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,079
Corrupt. Corrupt. Corrupt.

298
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:33,959
Anti-Corruption
officials are the most corrupt.

299
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:41,960
Absolutely.

300
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,279
I love Marutis.

301
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,239
There is no car like the Maruti.

302
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,799
It's great value for money.

303
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,759
Well done, Tej.

304
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,759
What's the average?

305
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,199
21.

306
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,239
21 kilometres per litre.

307
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,519
She never runs out of gas!

308
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,879
This is not a car.

309
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,799
Not a car?

310
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,319
What is it then?

311
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,799
It's a LUV my friend, it's a LUV.

312
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,799
Life Utility Vehicle.

313
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,439
Cheers!
- Cheers!

314
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,759
Crap! My drink is finished.

315
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:57,679
Let's get another drink
and charge our batteries!

316
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,239
This is also a great Maruti...

317
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:08,919
Yes, I bought this for my Shalu...

318
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,679
Jasleen, it's Sameer.
Sameer err Khullar.

319
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:20,680
Please come, I'm here.

320
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,839
Jasleen.
- It's Jazzlin.

321
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,239
You're... you're looking...

322
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,478
I know... I'll stop
the traffic, right?

323
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:57,800
Yeah! You're looking hot,
like a fruit punch.

324
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:00,079
Thanks.
- Come let's go!

325
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,039
Sorry, sorry.

326
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,399
Careful... your skirt!

327
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,360
Please drop me back to
my hostel by midnight.

328
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:20,839
Okay... Jazzline!

329
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,080
Please park carefully, buddy.

330
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:30,081
Don't worry, sir, I do this everyday.

331
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:40,160
Cheers, Jasleen.

332
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,360
So Sameer, what do you do,
other than college?

333
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:48,639
I do locking, popping,
b-boying and krumping. - Interesting.

334
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,159
So tell me, how many
girls have you gone out with?

335
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,558
To tell you the truth, no
one's even looked at me yet.

336
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,118
However, in school I
did have a girlfriend.

337
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:59,320
Manpreet Bhullar. You know,
Bhullar and Khullar.

338
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:03,519
But it was kind of long
distance so it didn't go anywhere.

339
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,159
You mean Chandigarh to Canada?

340
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,119
No, I mean from one side of
the classroom to the other!

341
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,560
Do you just want to
sit here with a drink

342
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:18,999
or should I show you my locking,
popping and shopping?

343
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,679
Only for you Because you are so hot.

344
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,439
Only for you Because you are so hot.

345
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,079
My heart is a balloon Fill it up soon

346
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,799
I am so restless, Come to me soon.

347
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,719
Oh baby listen You're my passion

348
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,599

love you, is my mission

349
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,079
Yeah

350
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,799
I have loved you I still love you

351

I will always love you

354
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,839
Only for you

355
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,799
Because you are so hot.

356
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,599
Only for you

357
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,679
Because you are so hot.

358
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:15,680
Come on, honey...

359
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,799
I always thought you were a fool

360
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:26,679
But your personality is super-cool

361
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,839
You are a good man

362
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,199
Now I am your fan.

363
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,160
I won't break your heart ever

364
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:36,279
Guarantee of my love is forever.

365
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,479

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,279
Because you are so hot.

374
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,239
Only for you

375
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,440
Because you are so hot.

00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:01,039

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,399
I will take your
other lovers for a swing

I'll swing them
around And throw them out.

382
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:21,799
You are handsome

383
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,599
I am awesome

384
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,639
There are a lot of men

385
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,440
But I want to be in your den.

386
00:22:27,441 --> 00:22:32,479
Let me ring the strings of your
heart as you know I am so smart

387
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,640
Put your left leg out and right leg in

388
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:36,679
You have made me fall for you

389
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,119
I am in love with you

390
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,159
You have made me fall for you

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,679
I am in love with you

396
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,599

00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,439
I am in love with you

Only for you

399
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,879
Because you are so hot.

400
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,999
Only for you

401
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,359
Because you are so hot.

402
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,760
Tomorrow evening, 5pm at Million Mugs.

403
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:09,399
See you. Sleep sweet.

404
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,479
Because you are so hot.

405
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Only for you

406
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,759
Park my car.

407
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,080
Dude! I'm not a valet!

408
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:34,081
Excuse me, hot wheels!

409
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:45,760
Want to go for a ride?

410
00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:00,559
Your brother hung out with
"It's Jazzlin" at the Gehri Route!

411
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,519
You know...

412
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,359
You know... she's not a girl...

413
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,399
You mean a she-male?

414
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,239
No! She's like Honey Singh's rap,

415
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,839
like beer on the tap.

416
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,159
And you are full of crap!

417
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,280
I don't see any future in this...

418
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:25,281
So stop being desperate.

419
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,679
Hey you prince of negativity,

420
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,520
she is meeting your
brother tomorrow for coffee.

421
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,719
You know what coffee means?

422
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,199
Not just any coffee.

423
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,599
"A-lot
- Can-happen-over-coffee" coffee.

424
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,279
Stop drinking, you'll throw up again.

425
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,879
Damn!

426
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,839
You puked on my I-phone.

427
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,199
Shit, cops!

428
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,079
We were just leaving.

429
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,919
Where are you going?

430
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,639
What are you up to??

431
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,320
Making an MMS of the girl?

432
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:11,759
No, sir. Not at all!

433
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
You think I'm an idiot?
- No, sir.

434
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:18,159
I don't believe you.

435
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,640
Ask your girlfriend to
step out of the car.

436
00:25:20,641 --> 00:25:23,919
Excuse me, I'm not
his girlfriend, okay?

437
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,959
Fine boyfriend then?

438
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,839
Just step out please.

439
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,439
What have you given her?

440
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
The date drug?
- No, sir. Absolutely not.

441
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:38,199
Excuse me! I'm not drunk, okay?

442
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,400
She seems to have drunk the
entire bar down but "I'm not drunk!"

443
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:43,839
Look, I can walk.

444
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,799
Hey, stop.
- Running for my life!

445
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,118
Where are you going?

446
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,840
Please take this "Excuse Me" with you!

447
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,079
Come back.

448
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,199
I'll drop you on the bullet now.

449
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,839
Hot wheels, aah!

450
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,520
Excuse me!

451
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,399
You dance well, senti fellow

452
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,719
I should've joined
the summer dance class.

453
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,839
Dancing is not for you.

454
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,079
Are you sure, bro?

455
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,919
Buddy, can you get my car please?

456
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,719
Sir your, card?

457
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,439
Not card, buddy, car. C-A-R.

458
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,199
It's a red Ertiga. Hurry up please.

459
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,399
Sir, I think you are mistaken.

460
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,759
We haven't parked any red Ertiga.

461
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,959
Yes, we have a red Alto.

462
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,998
Gattu, why do people think of
small cars when they look at me?

463
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,238
We drank the booze, but
it's hit him, I think.

464
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:41,720
Sir, please listen to me.
- Come on valet guy, do your job!

465
00:26:41,721 --> 00:26:49,721
Sir, sir how can I bring your
car when I haven't even parked it?

466
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,479
Don't joke, buddy... it's not funny.

467
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,119
You're the one who's joking, sir.

468
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,919
I've seen enough like you,

469
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,839
wearing fake Rado watches

470
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,639
asking for keys to expensive cars...

471
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,519
Got it?

472
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,879
Hey, how dare you!

473
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,380
Sorry.

474
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,318
Dude, are you sure you
gave the keys to the valet?

475
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:31,080
Then who else would I
give them to? Jazzy B?

476
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:38,279
Don't be smart! Think hard,
who did you give the keys to?

477
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,598
Do you think the bogus
police stole your car?

478
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:44,038
Use a flashlight and see if
there is a brain in your head or not?

479
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,840
Car thieves wear cop uniforms,
not valet uniforms, you idiot.

480
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:48,399
Stop scaring me!

481
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,119
Do you think the car got towed?

482
00:27:52,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Come. Hurry up, let's check.

483
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,719
Amrit, there is nothing going
on with the first floor woman,

484
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:28,720
I'm only yours.

485
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,880
Hello, sir. We are Sameer and Gattu.

486
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:39,239
By any chance did you or your
friends tow our car from Madhya Marg?

487
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,999
Towing? At 2 am!

488
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,279
Are you boys crazy?

489
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,520
Were you drinking and driving?

490
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:49,919
Hell no! Just tonic water.

491
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,920
Whose name is the car registered in?

492
00:28:51,921 --> 00:28:53,239
Tej!

493
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,440
Sir, I think I know where the car

494
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:59,319
is... it's slowly
coming back to me. Come on.

495
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,120
Should we ask them, in
case they have seen the car?

496
00:29:02,121 --> 00:29:04,919
Forget it, he's with his girlfriend.

497
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,239
Excuse me!

498
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,359
I'm not his girlfriend, okay?

499
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:16,360
Okay!

500
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,519
Do you recall anything?

501
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,479
Who did you give the keys to?

502
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:36,480
There is a limit to screwing up.

503
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:50,279
We are done for...

504
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,079
By the way, are you
feeling a sense of pride?

505
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,639
Only you could have lost
such a big car, by God!

506
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,120
Gattu, we need to think of a
replacement plan by tomorrow morning.

507
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:06,759
Otherwise Tej will bury me alive!

508
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,479
Not tomorrow morning my friend, today.

509
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:18,480
This morning!

510
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,920
Tej, are you going to
have bills for breakfast?

511
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:29,359
Shalu, for the next year

512
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,040
I will be eating bills for breakfast,
lunch and dinner!

513
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,239
We are spending in lacs...

514
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,320
And we still haven't received
any bills from Shivalik Farm.

515
00:30:37,321 --> 00:30:40,159
I don't know what's going to happen!

516
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,440
Come, son, sit down.

517
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:49,441
Sameer!

518
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,239
Wow! I can't believe it.

519
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,919
Son, are you free this evening?

520
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:13,319
I'm sorry for asking but tonight
is your sister's cocktail function.

521
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh come on, dad, I know that!

522
00:31:15,001 --> 00:31:20,359
Shalu, he knows that! He knows that.

523
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,719
Give me your blessings?
"I know that" I believe.

524
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,759
You've started again!

525
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:32,319
Okay, fine. Shalu, I'm
taking the Ertiga to the office.

526
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,638
Okay? - But dad, the
car belongs to the loser!

527
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:37,800
Sameer! Is this the way to
address your brother-in-law?

528
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:41,119
Stupid buffoon!

529
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:49,120
Leave it now, you go!

530
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:01,319
Why is the lock not opening?

531
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,119
Wrong keys...

532
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,439
Who's going to get the
right ones? Your dad?

533
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:15,359
Dad why don't you
take the Swift instead?

534
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,799
Stupid buffoon!

535
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:28,800
Save me, God!

536
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,079
Lovely-Giggly-Cutie-Princie...

537
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,239
Come on kids, let's go home...

538
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,719
If mummy and daddy catch you,
they will be angry.

539
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,599
Your boyfriend's left?

540
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:09,519
Silly boy. Let's go inside.
Come on now!

541
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,439
Okay, great. Sounds good.

542
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,840
Please make sure you
make the cocktails..

543
00:33:15,841 --> 00:33:19,599
...with the cheapest
vodka for tonight's function.

544
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,559
How about some discount?

545
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,319
Five per cent? Okay, at least two?

546
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:37,320
Okay, just one per cent for
my happiness? Please, please.

547
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,599
70 mins...70 mins is all we have...

548
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,838
I can't tell you what you need
to achieve in the next 70 mins.

549
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:02,118
All I can tell you
is that after 70 mins,

550
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:05,598
Tej will come home for lunch and
not find the car in the garage.

551
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:07,240
Then he will take a hockey
stick and beat the crap out of us.

552
00:34:07,241 --> 00:34:11,559
And if today Tej plays the
best hockey of his life,

553
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:17,719
then even God can't
save us. Best of luck

554
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,560
Yes, sir, how can I help you?

555
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:21,279
We want a red Ertiga.

556
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,839
Certainly, sir,

557
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,600
is your dad joining us as well?

558
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:28,919
Why? Is there a "Dads
only" board outside?

559
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,280
I'm very sorry, sir.

560
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:33,399
Please come this way.

561
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,599
Okay, sir...

562
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,919
This is the latest Maruti Ertiga.

563
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,518
It's a proper seven-seater
car with foldable rear seats

564
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:42,160
to increase the boot space.

565
00:34:42,161 --> 00:34:46,079
It's available in six
variants with two engine options.

566
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,399
How much is it?

567
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,879
With registration and add-ons,
only ten lacs.

568
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,119
Only!
- Yes, sir.

569
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,878
Don't you have a
scheme in which we pay only

570
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,278
five-ten thousand as a down payment?

571
00:34:56,279 --> 00:34:58,118
And spend the rest of
our lives selling our souls

572
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:00,120
to pay the remaining instalments?
Yes, Gattu?

573
00:35:00,121 --> 00:35:01,959
Correct!

574
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:07,999
Sir, test-drive a car and
you might actually win one!

575
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,679
I went to the market and
bought a pair of slippers

576
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,519
My dad's Maruti flew away
with a pair of flippers.

577
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,958
Sir, the people sitting behind
never feel they are sitting behind.

578
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:21,760
Pull the second row
lever and you will straight

579
00:35:21,761 --> 00:35:23,479
away be in the third row.

580
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:29,999
If you are sleepy then fold both
the rows and your flat bed is ready

581
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,799
That's why we say it's
not a car, it's a LUV!

582
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,119
Life Utility Vehicle.

583
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,760
And this car belongs to "the loser".

584
00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:44,959
And you are the idiot who
lost this car in one day!

585
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:52,960
Get out of the way.

586
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,319
This car is my dad's love

587
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,759
However if I lose it
- Honey Maasi!

588
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,679
I will lose my breath

589
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,359
It seems it will be my death

590
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,079
But my heart, take a chill pill

591
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,240
I don't care if it's late night still.

592
00:36:23,241 --> 00:36:29,719
I will drive all night at will.

593
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:35,919
It's original.

594
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,319
It's midnight still

595
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,239
My dad's Maruti
wants to drive even more

596
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,560
wants to break the border My dad's
Maruti wants to dash into Lahore.

597
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:50,639
My dad's Maruti
wants to drive even more

598
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,679
My dad's Maruti

599
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:02,680
It's not a car, sir, it's a LUV!

600
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:29,559
Hi, how are you? Sameer?
- Yes, yes. I'm Irfan.

601
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,238
Please ask your friend to relax.

602
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:33,478
He can get even stolen
choppers here, if he wants!

603
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:37,040
Even if you give us free choppers
today, we will only take an Ertiga.

604
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:38,999
Don't worry, you'll get it.

605
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,480
By the way, where are we
going to get this chopper?

606
00:37:41,481 --> 00:37:44,999
We are going to
Brother Hussain's garage.

607
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,919
Is he like a
Gangster-brother or a Brother-Brother?

608
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,560
Irfan, where have you got us?

609
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:59,561
Come, come.

610
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,600
Chotu... you moron!
What kind of tea is this?

611
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:04,479
There is no sugar?

612
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,800
Hussain Bro!
- What's he saying?

613
00:38:05,801 --> 00:38:11,839
I think he is referring
to sugar-free in Urdu...

614
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:17,759
Wow Irfan, looks like
today's food will be delicious!

615
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,479
The lamb looks meaty.

616
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,479
Kids, how can I help you today?

617
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,840
Hello, sir, we are Sameer and Gattu.

618
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:31,319
We want a Maruti Ertiga.

619
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:39,320
Really? Wonderful.

620
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,599
This is what I call true love.

621
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,240
She has arrived just today,

622
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:08,239
And her lovers have come seeking her.

623
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:14,079
As they say, love and
stink cannot be hidden!

624
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,999
Sir, you lost me at love.

625
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,480
Sir, not love! Ertiga!

626
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:20,279
We need one in red. Right away.

627
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:26,119
Son, this car is not the sky
that will stay blue forever.

628
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,998
True.
- Irfan, can you please translate?

629
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:31,038
He is saying, he will paint
the car red. - Super duper!

630
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:32,400
When can we get the car?

631
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:35,199
What will it cost us?

632
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,840
Give me six. You can
take the car tomorrow.

633
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:39,079
Six? As in six lacs!

634
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,639
Tomorrow? Hell, no!

635
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,438
Hussain bhai, can you
please reduce the price?

636
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:45,278
We are in trouble as
it is... please help us.

637
00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:47,880
Next time we want to buy a
stolen car, we will come to you.

638
00:39:47,881 --> 00:39:55,881
In fact, we will never buy
an original car ever again.

639
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:04,560
Fine. Give me five. I
cannot reduce it any further.

640
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,919
Okay, sir. Done. Advance?

641
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:16,920
One second.

642
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:27,800
My savings?

643
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,318
The balance on delivery. Please, sir.

644
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:33,360
Listen, kid, you should
know that I am a warrior.

645
00:40:33,361 --> 00:40:35,319
Got that!

646
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:40,559
If you misbehave,

647
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:47,719
I promise on Allah, I will paint
the moon red, with your blood.

648
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,438
This car we get only tomorrow...
How do we manage today?

649
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:52,520
Chill out, Gattu.
- I have a plan.

650
00:40:52,521 --> 00:40:58,319
Dahiya Rent A Car.

651
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:03,239
Are you seeing this?

652
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,918
When do you need the car?

653
00:41:04,919 --> 00:41:06,398
Today, as in right now.

654
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:07,838
Today? Sorry, not possible.

655
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,238
This car has already been
booked for 6pm this evening.

656
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,598
So can't we have the car until 6pm?

657
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,838
Senior Dahiya has booked this car
himself. No one can change that.

658
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,600
Dahiya, brother, I'm
sure you can help us!

659
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:25,119
I would've helped you had
Dhaiya senior been in Chandigarh.

660
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,319
Look! Dhaiya senior is there!

661
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,399
That's Dahiya junior.
Dahiya senior is his father.

662
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,479
He's Junior!

663
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,919
What's the matter?

664
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,959
These boys want a car.

665
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,398
Hello, uncle. We are Sameer and Gattu.

666
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:40,718
We are in deep trouble.

667
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:43,240
In short, if we leave without a
red Ertiga my father will screw me.

668
00:41:43,241 --> 00:41:47,959
Please, sir, please, sir.

669
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,279
Gehlot, give these boys the keys.

670
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,599
You'd better return
the car by 6pm sharp,

671
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,600
if not, you will have to
deal with my dad directly.

672
00:41:57,601 --> 00:41:58,999
Definitely!

673
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,119
The hire is 3000 per day.

674
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,039
Okay, right?

675
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,359
Sir, it's yours.

676
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,078
This is a red colour beauty

677
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:13,120
With a pretty bonnet, yet heavy duty.

678
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:15,199
All cars fade away

679
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,840
When this beauty makes her way.

680
00:42:16,841 --> 00:42:18,679
Come folks, sit with me

681
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,519
Come folks, sit with me

682
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:26,719
Let's move in style, let the rest see.

683
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,119
It's midnight still

684
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,920
My dad's Maruti
wants to drive even more

685
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:33,919
My dad's Maruti
wants to drive even more

686
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,319
My dad's Maruti
wants to break the border

687
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,479
Wow! What a beautiful necklace!

688
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,278
Is it for the engagement, Tanvi?

689
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,120
No, Honey aunty, for
the wedding ceremony.

690
00:42:43,121 --> 00:42:45,199
How much is it?

691
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,319
Only five lacs.

692
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:53,119
It's really worth it!

693
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,959
Tej has spent good money this time.

694
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:01,759
Nice! I like it.

695
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,838
But I can't believe we are
being made to pack Raj's trousseau.

696
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,720
I don't understand why Tej
makes me do all Raj related stuff.

697
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:11,279
See, he's Y-front
designer underwear for Raj.

698
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,239
It's kind of small.

699
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,959
Oh, shit! Jasleen's text!

700
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,158
It's already 4.30pm.

701
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:18,120
I have to meet Jasleen
at 5pm at Million Mugs.

702
00:43:18,121 --> 00:43:21,439
What should I wear?

703
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,079
Sameer. Sameer.

704
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,639
Bro, do you have cash for cab?

705
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,160
Are you insane or just insane?

706
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:32,799
I'm taking the new car.

707
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,359
Tej is in the office so no
one's going to find out.

708
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,799
Stop getting stressed for nothing.

709
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,678
Jackass! Be it Tiger
Woods or Bill Clinton,

710
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:45,238
all great men have
been ruined by women.

711
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:48,240
You will also go down
you fool. Bloody idiot.

712
00:43:48,241 --> 00:43:56,241
I'm not your brother anymore!

713
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,399
Go on, put on the disclaimer.

714
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,438
There is no one hotter than you here.

715
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,478
Sameer, you know for someone whose
last girlfriend didn't even know

716
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:15,400
that she was your girl friend,

717
00:44:15,401 --> 00:44:17,759
you're quite a flirt.

718
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:25,760
Well let's hope my next
girlfriend knows she's my girlfriend!

719
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,518
I'll just be back. Hello
- Sameer.

720
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:29,758
Yes, Mr. Junior, sir.

721
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:32,840
Return the car, it's
time for the next booking.

722
00:44:32,841 --> 00:44:34,839
It's almost 6pm.
- So soon!

723
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,878
You promised to return the car by 6pm.

724
00:44:36,879 --> 00:44:39,400
If you break your promise,
my father will kill me.

725
00:44:39,401 --> 00:44:40,679
You are late.

726
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,278
Now go directly to the bus station

727
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:45,480
and pick up the clients
and drop them at their hotel.

728
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:45,981
Hello.

729
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,120
Sorry. I hope you're not bored.
- Of course not.

730
00:44:52,121 --> 00:44:54,639
Waiting is my favorite pastime.

731
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,400
That's nice. I just
need a few minutes more...

732
00:44:56,401 --> 00:44:59,439
There's a small problem. I'll be back.

733
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,119
Gattu, you're my brother?
- Hell, no!

734
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,838
Gattu, please be my brother.
- Hell, no!

735
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,360
Please do your brother a small favour.

736
00:45:05,361 --> 00:45:13,361
Not fair man! Not fair!!

737
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,680
Okay, tell me, how does a
Punjabi auto rickshaw know Shakespeare?

738
00:45:21,681 --> 00:45:28,479
Why? - Because passengers
always say, Othello-Othello.

739
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,118
Very funny! - Sorry! Sorry!
- What do you think, Sameer?

740
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:33,398
By cracking a joke you
will make up for the crap

741
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:34,758
that you have pulled today?

742
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:35,998
I'm very sorry, Jasleen.

743
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:39,158
I promise you I'll do
whatever you ask of me. I swear.

744
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:41,478
Oh God, Sameer. We
are not kids any more.

745
00:45:41,479 --> 00:45:43,398
What is this "I swear"? Grow up!

746
00:45:43,399 --> 00:45:45,080
Jasleen, I will grow if you don't go.

747
00:45:45,081 --> 00:45:51,999
Shit. That came out
all wrong. I'm sorry.

748
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,799
Fine.

749
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,599
Last chance.

750
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,520
Let's go for a drive to Kalka.

751
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:59,159
To the hills and back.

752
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,398
Sure, but I sent the car back home.

753
00:46:01,399 --> 00:46:03,000
Awesome. Let's take rickshaw then!

754
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:06,159
Really? Jasleen?

755
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:14,160
It's Jazzline!

756
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,679
Come on.

757
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,999
Pick up the bag.

758
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,238
Look around... has
someone come to pick us up?

759
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:34,640
Yeah, looking. There he is!
He is standing there.

760
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:36,639
Oh yes!

761
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,160
Hello! Dahiya-Rent-A-Car?

762
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:39,879
I am Khosla. And you?

763
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,198
I am Dahiya-Rent-A -Car?
- Hey Shimpi, it's him.

764
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:45,040
Just hand it on the shoulder.
Give me that.

765
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:53,041
Don't worry, it's not
very heavy. This one too.

766
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,879
Son, you seem like a cool kid...

767
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,438
How did you end up being a driver?

768
00:47:01,439 --> 00:47:03,240
Recession, uncle. Recession.

769
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:07,359
So I thought I should
help my father by driving.

770
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,280
Anyway, once I go to Canada,
I'll drive a cab for sure!

771
00:47:10,281 --> 00:47:11,519
That's great.

772
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,239
How sad. He's so poor.

773
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,158
Son, do you even have a house or
did your family have to sell it?

774
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:18,840
I have a 2-acre bungalow!

775
00:47:18,841 --> 00:47:19,657
Yes?
- Yes!

776
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,999
Son, how far is Hotel Park View?

777
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Aunty, it's just around the corner.

778
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,439
Congratulations!

779
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,239
Well done, Tej.
Everything looks spectacular!

780
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,359
Come on, charge your batteries!

781
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,679
Hey, Sameer, come here.

782
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,759
Please meet my son.

783
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,000
Take their blessings.
It's Mr. and Mrs. Khosla...

784
00:48:31,001 --> 00:48:35,959
Blessings, uncle.
- Hope you have a long life.

785
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,958
And this is Gattu, Sameer's friend.

786
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:40,000
Uncle, I have some errands
to run, I'll just be back.

787
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:47,199
Come here. Come here, son.

788
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,319
You here?

789
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,879
Are you on duty here?

790
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,599
Duty? What duty?

791
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,839
Tej, the car hire company
sent him to pick us up today.

792
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,079
Tell him, son.

793
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,679
Gattu, you're a driver?

794
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,039
Such a wonderful boy, but
what a tragedy hit his family.

795
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,919
Is this an age to be poor?

796
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,079
Poor? Gattu, you're poor?

797
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,239
Thanks to the recession his
father's business went bust.

798
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,720
That's why he's being
forced to be a part-time driver.

799
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,319
Hang on a minute.

800
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:25,319
Gattu, your dad's left the Indian
army and started his own business?

801
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,639
And he didn't even tell me!

802
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,360
I'm going to speak to
the Brigadier right away.

803
00:49:29,361 --> 00:49:34,119
No uncle, please don't call dad!

804
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,999
Son, why didn't you tell me?

805
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,520
Such a big incident and you
didn't mention it to me even once!

806
00:49:38,521 --> 00:49:44,679
Let me hug you.

807
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,799
Don't worry...

808
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:52,799
From now on, who will
sponsor your education? Tej!

809
00:49:52,800 --> 00:50:00,800
Understood? And listen... Take this!

810
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:09,680
Tej Khullar and Ashok Arora!

811
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:36,080
Let's call on stage the Bride's
brother and the Groom's sister!

812
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,679
First call the ambulance,
then the caterers! - What? Why?

813
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,719
Sameer Khullar and Jasleen Bhasin.

814
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:53,720
Jazzline... It's Jazzline!

815
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,718
She will tell your dad you
took the car out of the house.

816
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:08,838
Tej will know immediately
that you've lost the car.

817
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:10,358
Upon hearing this, he
will have a heart attack.

818
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:12,318
Then obviously the
wedding will be cancelled.

819
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,720
Didn't I tell you so!

820
00:51:13,721 --> 00:51:17,439
All the great men have
been ruined by women.

821
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,759
Shut up!

822
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:26,760
Jasleen is Raj's sister? Unbelievable!

823
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,159
Fool!

824
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,199
Sameer!

825
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:14,919
Dad?

826
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,759
Dad!

827
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,319
Best of luck.

828
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,799
Why didn't you tell us
that you know Jasleen?

829
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:27,519
Why haven't you invited
her home to eat, ever?

830
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,959
Oh yes, dad.

831
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,919
Yes, dad.

832
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,959
Tej, Mr. Kapoor is here!

833
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,519
Mr. Kapoor is here!

834
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,919
Enjoy, kids.

835
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,280
You never told me
Tanvi was your sister.

836
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:43,879
Last night, and this evening,
we were together.

837
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,038
I have a sudden cough;
I'll need an urgent brandy.

838
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,278
She is going tell him everything.

839
00:52:48,279 --> 00:52:49,080
You're done.

840
00:52:49,081 --> 00:52:51,439
Last night and this evening?

841
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,599
What an amazing dress,
Jasleen! Sea green suits you.

842
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,679
It's actually aqua blue, but thanks.

843
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,759
I hope it's not too
showy for this function.

844
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,359
Don't... don't change the topic.

845
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,958
You were out of the hostel last night?

846
00:53:05,959 --> 00:53:07,600
Actually there was a party...
last night.

847
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,999
Oh, and by the way, amazing sandals!

848
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,159
Peep toes...

849
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,638
Let her finish
- So last night what?

850
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:16,358
So basically...

851
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,560
And what mind-blasting earrings,
Jasleen, absolutely superb!

852
00:53:18,561 --> 00:53:20,119
Sameer! Are you gay?

853
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,359
Earrings, dress, peep toes!

854
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,839
Let her finish.

855
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,199
Last night what?

856
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,440
So basically, there was
this party last night,

857
00:53:27,441 --> 00:53:31,559
and Sameer was like, 'be my date',
and I was like, why not?

858
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:38,239
So he came to pick me up in
this hot... new... sexy...

859
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,559
Gattu is hurt. Hurry.

860
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:47,159
Weakness! Poverty!
No food since morning.

861
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:55,160
Poverty saved us, Sameer!

862
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,959
Get well soon, Gattu...

863
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,239
Thanks, bro!

864
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:01,740
Dog!

865
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,479
So sweet!

866
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:13,319
You're so silly, why didn't
you tell me about the wedding?

867
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,679
Obviously your phone will ring.

868
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,079
I am so embarrassed
about my behaviour.

869
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:26,759
I am so sorry, Jasleen,
I should have told you

870
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,759
Okay, listen.
- Yes?

871
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,398
Are you very busy at
the wedding tomorrow?

872
00:54:31,399 --> 00:54:32,238
Of course not.

873
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:33,960
I am not the one getting married.

874
00:54:33,961 --> 00:54:35,279
What is the plan?

875
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,560
The shopping is the plan, is the!

876
00:54:36,561 --> 00:54:44,561
The Cool The.

877
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:47,999
What?

878
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,359
Have you lost it?

879
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,400
Do you remember it's Sunday tomorrow?

880
00:54:51,401 --> 00:54:52,839
I remember!

881
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,199
Obviously!

882
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,040
Tej will shift the car to
Shivalik's farm tomorrow.

883
00:54:57,041 --> 00:55:00,999
He will then give
Dahiya's cab to Raj and Tanvi!

884
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,438
Have you forgotten
that I am poor, Gattu

885
00:55:03,439 --> 00:55:05,160
and have to return the Dahiya's cab?

886
00:55:05,161 --> 00:55:10,239
Chill. I have the biggest plan.

887
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:17,199
That's disgusting man!

888
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,920
This is a high flying car. Just
arrived from the showroom afar.

889
00:55:20,921 --> 00:55:28,159
There were so many speed breakers
But the breaks were her care-takers.

890
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,158
This is a high flying car. Just
arrived from the showroom afar.

891
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:35,560
There were so many speed breakers
But the breaks were her care-takers.

892
00:55:35,561 --> 00:55:37,519
But still, there's a will

893
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,160
To spin in this fancy car
With all the energy, uphill.

894
00:55:41,161 --> 00:55:42,799
You are too cool, man.

895
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,319
My dad's Maruti
wants to drive some more

896
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:53,039
My dad's Maruti
wants to drive some more

897
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,919
Thank you.

898
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:03,920
The plan of all plans!

899
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,199
Come on, drink up!

900
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,279
Maruti showroom?

901
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,319
Hello...

902
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,119
Hello.

903
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,840
Speak softer, in case,
the phone gets hurt.

904
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:20,359
What's up?

905
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,800
Good morning, sir... Sir, I'm
calling from the Maruti showroom...

906
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:25,079
Yes, tell me.

907
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,360
Sir... since you are
our esteemed customer,

908
00:56:27,361 --> 00:56:30,319
we have a special gift offer for you.

909
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,640
Are you giving me a free car?

910
00:56:31,641 --> 00:56:32,639
No, sir...

911
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,039
We would like to
decorate your car with flowers.

912
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,919
That too free of cost.

913
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,319
Free? For sure?

914
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:46,399
Just send us your car and we
shall dress her up like a bride.

915
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,599
That's great. Big thanks.

916
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,519
You've saved me big trouble.

917
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,960
I am sending you the car right away.

918
00:56:54,961 --> 00:56:56,839
That's more like it.

919
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:01,319
Where are you, silly fellow?

920
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,320
Wow, look at him.

921
00:57:02,321 --> 00:57:03,239
There he is.

922
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,799
Ohhoo, aahaaa.

923
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,119
Hello, crazy fellow.

924
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,638
Yes, dad... any work for me?

925
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:12,238
Maruti people are keen
to save my 2,000 rupees.

926
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:14,240
So take the car back to the showroom.

927
00:57:14,241 --> 00:57:16,279
Oh ho, dad, only for you!

928
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:20,439
Only for you!

929
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:28,440
Look at him showing off his body.

930
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:54,959
Sameer Chandigarh has four
shopping malls, but none this side.

931
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,119
Baby, we are going shopping.

932
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,318
I will drop of this
car off for decoration,

933
00:57:59,319 --> 00:58:01,000
and we'll take a cab from there.

934
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:03,159
Why didn't you tell me?

935
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,320
I would've borrowed
my brother Raj's car.

936
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:08,919
I believe if you are in a
relationship with someone

937
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,039
you should always go Dutch.

938
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,280
I always believe in equal relations.

939
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,679
Me too, so sweet!

940
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,279
Why should girls always cook for boys?

941
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,079
Correct!

942
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,600
Even boys should cook
for girls sometimes?

943
00:58:21,601 --> 00:58:23,319
I'll cook for you.

944
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:31,320
Really?
- Really.

945
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:41,239
There are only buffalos here,
no flowers anywhere.

946
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,199
The Senior?

947
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,239
World's oldest senior!

948
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,878
Not that you look old, sir.

949
00:58:46,879 --> 00:58:48,640
Seriously, not a day over 80.

950
00:58:48,641 --> 00:58:51,759
Aren't you the thief who stole my car?

951
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,120
No theft... we're
here to return the car.

952
00:58:54,121 --> 00:58:56,959
This car is his?

953
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,599
Yes it is.

954
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,439
Do you have a car or not?

955
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:06,839
'Technically' I do... but
I've misplaced it somewhere.

956
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:11,639
Put the gun down, they
are just kids. Kids, run!

957
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,760
He is having a heart attack. Again.

958
00:59:13,761 --> 00:59:17,319
Someone help! Sit down. Rest here.

959
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,119
Sit down. Rest here.

960
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,559
We can't leave him like this!

961
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:24,119
Junior, sir.

962
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,880
Let's take him to the hospital.
Get the car.

963
00:59:25,881 --> 00:59:27,319
Get the car. Hurry!

964
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,799
Get the car!

965
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,079
Don't worry, sir.

966
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,398
Are you crazy? You hired
this car just for a party!

967
00:59:35,399 --> 00:59:38,838
Because he thought you
only date guys with cool cars.

968
00:59:38,839 --> 00:59:41,718
No baby, the party
night I was in my own car.

969
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:44,000
It's only after I dropped
you off that I lost the car.

970
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:47,959
And if his father finds out,
he will beat us to a pulp.

971
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,200
What! You mean his father
doesn't know that his car is lost?

972
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:54,879
Just look at him. Does
he look worried at all?

973
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,518
This is exactly the problem.

974
00:59:56,519 --> 00:59:59,360
Tomorrow by the end of the
wedding I need a car somehow.

975
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:03,599
If you don't drive
faster I'll kill him.

976
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,758
So not fair, uncle!
He's the one driving.

977
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,038
Why will you kill me?

978
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,400
Drive fast, man, I haven't
even done it properly yet.

979
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:12,559
Really, say swear.

980
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,119
Anyway, back to me.

981
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,000
Sameer, you really
thought I was so shallow?

982
01:00:17,001 --> 01:00:17,959
You psychic.

983
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:23,159
It's Psycho Jasleen.
Psychics talk to dead people.

984
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:27,999
Emergency... wheelchair.

985
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,520
Don't worry, uncle; my
grandfather had the same thing.

986
01:00:30,521 --> 01:00:34,359
You will be fine, I promise.

987
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,880
I am so sorry for the delay.

988
01:00:35,881 --> 01:00:39,439
Your keys.

989
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,920
Go to the Spaatas guys...
Go to the cops.

990
01:00:41,921 --> 01:00:45,839
We went to the cops, but
they wanted Tej's phone number.

991
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,839
Guts, don't you trust your brother?

992
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,200
I have caused this crisis, right?

993
01:00:50,201 --> 01:00:53,519
I'll figure out a solution as well.

994
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,879
Call for you.

995
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,519
Your call.

996
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,000
Hello! Brother Hussain?

997
01:01:02,001 --> 01:01:04,719
What's up, kid?

998
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,519
Out for a party?

999
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,640
By the way, your lover is
ready and waiting for you.

1000
01:01:08,641 --> 01:01:09,719
Lover?

1001
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,839
Yes, and she is languishing for you.

1002
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,800
I'm sorry... what?

1003
01:01:14,801 --> 01:01:17,639
We were on our way to your garage.

1004
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,400
Look kid, I am waiting for you,

1005
01:01:19,401 --> 01:01:24,959
and I hate waiting so...
God be with you.

1006
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,959
Goodbye.

1007
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,439
TC, Bro!

1008
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,758
But weren't we going
to the engagement?

1009
01:01:31,759 --> 01:01:33,278
So baby, what should I
have told brother Hussain?

1010
01:01:33,279 --> 01:01:35,720
That I don't have
five lacs to give him.

1011
01:01:35,721 --> 01:01:39,279
But, what is a brother, Hussain?

1012
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,838
Listen, I have an idea.

1013
01:01:40,839 --> 01:01:44,760
Let's tweet a superstar and ask
him to request his fans to help us

1014
01:01:44,761 --> 01:01:46,639
by donating a rupee each.

1015
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,520
That way we'll have a
profit of 20 lacs, bro!

1016
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:51,919
Seriously? Like seriously, Gattu!

1017
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,639
Like seriously, man!

1018
01:01:53,640 --> 01:02:01,640
Guys, seriously!

1019
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:11,839
Patrolling is our duty, isn't it?

1020
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:14,519
Why is this car bouncing?

1021
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,399
Stop... stop... stop.

1022
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,839
Damn this youth.

1023
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,200
Is this a car or a honeymoon suite?

1024
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:30,201
Let's go.

1025
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:54,900
Sameer.

1026
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,800
Wappening Dad? New word. I made it up.

1027
01:03:02,801 --> 01:03:04,599
Shut up and listen.

1028
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:10,279
I've filled expensive
bottles with cheaper whiskey.

1029
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,118
Just serve it to the guests.

1030
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:14,440
Dad, over here as well?
Are you kidding me?

1031
01:03:14,441 --> 01:03:17,799
After giving birth to a kid like you,

1032
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,680
there isn't any
scope left for kidding!

1033
01:03:19,681 --> 01:03:27,681
Do it fast.

1034
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,959
This one is for you, Raj.

1035
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:42,119
You have done so much for me
over the seven years we dated.

1036
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,359
I have a small surprise for you.

1037
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:52,079
Things I haven't been able to say in
words are said in this performance.

1038
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:59,999
Hope you like it.

1039
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:07,439
You have seen so many girls

1040
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,279
You have seen so many girls

1041
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,839
But you haven't seen
anyone quite like me.

1042
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,639
My dress is tight

1043
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,639
Sending you the invite

1044
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,519
Let me turn you on tonight.

1045
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,639
Tonight I will love you,

1046
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,520
Tonight I won't hide anything from you

1047
01:04:26,521 --> 01:04:29,799
Tonight, it's me and you.

1048
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,359
When I move my hip

1049
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,559
You will go hip-hip-hurrah.

1050
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,159
When I move my hip

1051
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,319
You will go hip-hip-hurrah.

1052
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,839
When we love...

1053
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,959
You will go hip-hip-hurrah

1054
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,599
When I move my hip

1055
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:50,600
You will go hip-hip-hurrah.

1056
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,679
She is your sister, man.

1057
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,399
My hopes are hot hot

1058
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:10,599
I want kids and what not!

1059
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:14,199
My youth is dedicated to you

1060
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,879
I am waiting for you

1061
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,919
My youth is dedicated to you

1062
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,919
I am waiting for you

1063
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,440
I'll break all the
records of love with you

1064
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:26,159
I'll have a big family with you.

1065
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,279
Come on, honey!

1066
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,159
Tonight, I will excite you,

1067
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,999
Tonight, I will kiss you,

1068
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,079
Tonight it's me and you!

1069
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,759
When I move my hip

1070
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,879
You will go hip-hip-hurrah.

1071
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,479
When I move my hip

1072
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,599
You will go hip-hip-hurrah.

1073
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,199
When we love...

1074
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,319
You will go hip-hip-hurrah

1075
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,919
When I move my hip

1076
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:56,679
You will go hip-hip-hurrah.

1077
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,040
It's all messed up, Gattu!

1078
01:05:58,041 --> 01:06:00,279
No shit, Sherlock!

1079
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,919
Brother Hussain, you here?

1080
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,399
Enough is enough.

1081
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,719
Where is my money?

1082
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,038
Or should I ask your father for it?

1083
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:11,198
My sister is getting engaged today.

1084
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:12,718
We will be at your
garage with the remaining

1085
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,360
four lacs ninety five thousand.

1086
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:17,679
Just give us two hours.

1087
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,239
I am warning you...

1088
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:24,879
if my patience runs out,

1089
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:32,880
your life will run out too.

1090
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,440
I think he mentioned that we
are pretty much screwed now.

1091
01:06:46,441 --> 01:06:49,959
It's enough now, just
tell Sameer's dad the truth.

1092
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,160
That is not even an option,
Jasleen! I have a plan.

1093
01:06:52,161 --> 01:06:58,879
Mom is giving Tanvi a gold
necklace worth 5 lacs. It fits.

1094
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,399
Hold on, Sameer.

1095
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,359
You want to steal from your own home?

1096
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,239
You think Gattu is gutless?

1097
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,359
The real gutless one is you!

1098
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,040
I mean, what will happen if
you tell your dad the truth?

1099
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:15,319
He will ground you at the most.

1100
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,560
You think I am doing all
this because I am afraid of Tej?

1101
01:07:18,561 --> 01:07:23,199
I am very happy to be screamed
at by dad, if the car comes back!

1102
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,119
But it's not about that,

1103
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,919
I know Tanvi is
annoying and irritating

1104
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,839
but she is still my sister.

1105
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:35,879
Tej has promised her and
her husband a new car!

1106
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,839
And the promise will
be broken because of me!

1107
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,480
I know my father is a cheapskate,

1108
01:07:41,481 --> 01:07:45,319
he serves cheap booze
in expensive bottles,

1109
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,760
but however he is,
he is still my father.

1110
01:07:47,761 --> 01:07:53,439
Can you imagine his humiliation?

1111
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,239
Listen, Sameer, I
cannot support theft.

1112
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:01,039
Guys, this is not the time to fight,

1113
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,519
and Sameer, Jasleen is right,

1114
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,880
you want to be a
thief in your own house?

1115
01:08:04,881 --> 01:08:07,239
Have you lost it?

1116
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:15,240
Listen, there is no
need for you to help me.

1117
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:23,159
What was I thinking?

1118
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:27,519
I was stealing Tanvi's
necklace to return her car?

1119
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,599
To avoid hurting Tej,
I was hurting my mom?

1120
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,598
Dude, are you a public
prosecutor or a defence lawyer?

1121
01:09:33,599 --> 01:09:36,000
You cannot be both at the same time!

1122
01:09:36,001 --> 01:09:40,999
Gattu, I am stupid,
irritating, a fool, and dumb.

1123
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,719
But not a thief.

1124
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:51,239
Come on, let's think
of an alternative.

1125
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,679
Let's go.

1126
01:09:53,680 --> 01:10:00,679
What are you doing?

1127
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:08,680
You call, she won't pick up mine.

1128
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,879
Hello, Jazzline, come out.

1129
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,920
We are going to brother
Hussain's garage right now.

1130
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:23,199
'We?' I am not a part of your 'We'.

1131
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,759
Hello, Jazzline. I
didn't steal the necklace.

1132
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,759
We have another plan.

1133
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:32,039
Stop it, Sameer. No more plans.

1134
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,279
Don't you get it?

1135
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,720
I don't want to be a
part of this any more.

1136
01:10:35,721 --> 01:10:37,239
I am not like you.

1137
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,999
I know you are not like me, Jazzline,

1138
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,879
but are you love me?

1139
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:51,599
Because I am really love you.

1140
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,159
Jazzline?

1141
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:57,200
If you propose in pathetic English,
this is what will happen.

1142
01:10:57,201 --> 01:10:58,719
Cheezy boy.

1143
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:06,720
"I am not like you,
Jazzline, but am love you".

1144
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,999
I am also love you, Sameer.

1145
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,879
Psychic.

1146
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,919
Not you, me!

1147
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:25,920
I love talking to ghosts
and then hugging them too.

1148
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,638
Irfan, open the garage, we are here!

1149
01:11:35,639 --> 01:11:36,840
I can change a man's colour,
what's a car?

1150
01:11:36,841 --> 01:11:40,079
Anything can be sold
on the black market.

1151
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,839
Your work will be done. Don't worry!

1152
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,000
So sorry, brother Hussain, we're late.

1153
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:54,001
Goodbye.

1154
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:59,039
Kids, always remember,

1155
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:07,040
loss of time and loss of
a person is permanent.

1156
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:20,079
Where is the car?

1157
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,399
You doubt a warrior's word?

1158
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:27,400
Not at all, your words are irreversible,
like a permanent tattoo or something.

1159
01:12:27,401 --> 01:12:35,401
And they hurt!

1160
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:49,720
Awesome, awesome!

1161
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,679
My money first, and then your car.

1162
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:56,039
Absolutely, just the way you want it.

1163
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,839
Police?
- Police?

1164
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,079
Original or fake?

1165
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:03,159
Irfan! Only original
police raids, run, hurry, fast.

1166
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:06,559
Catch everyone.

1167
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:13,159
You hunt for those three!

1168
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:21,160
I am here!

1169
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,199
Come on, fast.

1170
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:31,200
Where the hell these cops come from?

1171
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,479
Come quick!

1172
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,758
Was this your plan,
baby, did you call the cops?

1173
01:13:35,759 --> 01:13:37,438
No baby, this wasn't my plan.

1174
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:39,198
So what was your plan, baby?

1175
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:40,558
I thought we would go there

1176
01:13:40,559 --> 01:13:42,680
and cause a distraction
and then escape with the car!

1177
01:13:42,681 --> 01:13:45,119
What?

1178
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,199
Baby, cops!

1179
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:54,200
Run.

1180
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:20,639
Excuse me, hot wheels.

1181
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:28,640
Excused, religious lady.

1182
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,639
Sameer...

1183
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:31,159
Sameer, hey sameer,

1184
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:39,160
where's the car, son?

1185
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:49,240
Son, get the car quickly!

1186
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:26,280
What a shame on Tej.

1187
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:34,479
Go get the car from the showroom,
idiots haven't sent it yet.

1188
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:42,480
Yes, yes, I am listening!

1189
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,839
Yes, tell me.

1190
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,879
Dad?
- One second, hold on.

1191
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,440
I want to talk to you please.

1192
01:16:56,441 --> 01:16:58,039
Get the car first,

1193
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:00,718
We'll talk on
Saturday after the wedding!

1194
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:01,918
Dad, it's important!

1195
01:17:01,919 --> 01:17:03,480
Okay, give me two minutes.

1196
01:17:03,481 --> 01:17:08,879
Yes, I am listening,
please clear the budget first.

1197
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,719
Hello.

1198
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,560
Brother Hussain has
been caught by the cops.

1199
01:17:11,561 --> 01:17:12,679
What?

1200
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:16,320
That Maruti car needs to be
cleared from the garage immediately.

1201
01:17:16,321 --> 01:17:20,919
Irfan, we lied, we don't
have 5 lacs to pay you.

1202
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,999
We have to get rid of the car.

1203
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,680
You can pay in instalments.

1204
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:26,279
Yes or no?

1205
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,558
No.
- You don't want it?

1206
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:31,400
No, I mean yes, we want it!
I'll just be there, okay? Bye.

1207
01:17:31,401 --> 01:17:33,839
Okay... okay, bye.

1208
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,199
Yes, now tell me.

1209
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:38,839
Dad, I'll get the
car from the showroom.

1210
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:46,840
The car is ready with flowers.
- Fool.

1211
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:58,160
He is coming here, sir.

1212
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,518
This vehicle is best
to dry clothes on.

1213
01:18:08,519 --> 01:18:10,600
We haven't spotted a car in two weeks.

1214
01:18:10,601 --> 01:18:14,159
Let's go to Patiala,
Chandigarh is dead.

1215
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:17,159
I have spotted an amazing car.

1216
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:20,599
It has been at the
same spot for three days.

1217
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,200
I hope it's not a police trap.

1218
01:18:22,201 --> 01:18:25,199
Idiot, have the
police ever caught anyone?

1219
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:33,200
Let's go.

1220
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:49,719
Irfan, where is the car?

1221
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:50,520
Where is the car?

1222
01:18:50,521 --> 01:18:57,639
So, kid? Looking for a stolen car?

1223
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:04,119
The number you are trying to
call is currently switched off!

1224
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:04,620
Sameer!

1225
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,559
Tell me honestly,

1226
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:14,240
what do you know about the gangs
operating the stolen car racket?

1227
01:19:14,241 --> 01:19:18,999
Sir, please try and understand,
I have lost my own car.

1228
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,160
Don't you remember, we
came to report a lost car,

1229
01:19:22,161 --> 01:19:24,079
Red Ertiga 6402!

1230
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,958
Well, if you did come... then
why didn't you file a report?

1231
01:19:26,959 --> 01:19:29,358
Because you would
have called my dad then.

1232
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:32,960
Had you called him then, you wouldn't
have needed to call him now. Dial.

1233
01:19:32,961 --> 01:19:35,039
Dad.

1234
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:39,519
What a useless child I have.

1235
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:47,520
What happened? Dead Battery?

1236
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,159
Unreachable number?

1237
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,520
You dialled the wrong number, right?

1238
01:20:04,521 --> 01:20:05,719
Don't worry, kid,

1239
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:13,720
an overnight stay in the
lock-up will set you right.

1240
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:27,479
Pass me the phone please.

1241
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,399
Hello, Tanvi?

1242
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,400
Sameer, where the hell are you?

1243
01:20:30,401 --> 01:20:31,879
Tanvi, where's dad?

1244
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:35,879
Dad is in the bathroom,
but dog, where are you?

1245
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,559
Late again?

1246
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,520
The wedding is in three hours!

1247
01:20:39,521 --> 01:20:42,159
Tanvi, I am in a mess.

1248
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:50,160
I have been caught by the police.

1249
01:20:54,440 --> 01:21:00,399
Sameer, you have
gone too far this time.

1250
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:08,400
What a wedding gift you've given me.

1251
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,959
Stop... Stop.

1252
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,199
Isn't it the same car, 6402?

1253
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:24,319
Well done.

1254
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,159
Take this honeymoon suite away.

1255
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:36,160
By the way, I am from sector
26 police station, and you?

1256
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,359
Why didn't he stop?

1257
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:52,599
Sir, I want to bail Sameer Khullar.

1258
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:57,159
You are his father?

1259
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:01,879
No, sir, I am his brother-in-law.

1260
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,918
Actually he is like a younger brother,

1261
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:06,280
that's why I have left my
own wedding to come here.

1262
01:22:06,281 --> 01:22:09,239
I am sorry if he did anything wrong.

1263
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,400
Sameer, what were you thinking?
Come on, man.

1264
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:12,559
Come in.

1265
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:17,439
Sir, I think the bogus police are
on a run with a red Ertiga 6402.

1266
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,478
Relax, I will sort it out.

1267
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:21,200
Listen you, what's
the number of your car?

1268
01:22:21,201 --> 01:22:24,439
CH-04-AE-6402

1269
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:30,319
Come with me, now!

1270
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,880
Sir, where are you taking us?

1271
01:22:31,881 --> 01:22:34,999
Sit in the jeep quickly.

1272
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,519
Towards Madhya Marg.

1273
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,479
Raj Bro, this is bad news.

1274
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,919
I think we are
victims of an encounter.

1275
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:51,239
Relax. Everything will be alright.

1276
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,838
We are heading to Madhya Marg.

1277
01:22:52,839 --> 01:22:55,078
Tell SI Sethi to cover
up with his beat van.

1278
01:22:55,079 --> 01:22:57,238
It's bogus police. Over and out.

1279
01:22:57,239 --> 01:22:59,158
Bogus police? As in fake police?

1280
01:22:59,159 --> 01:23:00,800
Sameer, just relax. I told you, right?

1281
01:23:00,801 --> 01:23:04,239
We will find your car. Sit quietly.

1282
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,959
Oh crap, that's my car.

1283
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:15,799
Towards Madhya Marg, fast!

1284
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:23,800
Sameer, sit back and relax.

1285
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,879
Idiot, can't you drive slowly?

1286
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:50,879
A scratch on the car
cuts through my heart.

1287
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,719
Get in, you fool.

1288
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,999
Stop the van.

1289
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Get in, idiot.

1290
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:23,320
Drive straight.

1291
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:33,680
Get out. Bloody thief. Take him away.

1292
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,279
Sir, those keys are mine.

1293
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,959
Sameer, if you repeat this game again,

1294
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:51,359
I am not going to spare you.

1295
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:57,839
Thank you for your help, sir.

1296
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,359
Take care of him.

1297
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:08,360
Pull the car down.

1298
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,759
Sameer, relax.

1299
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,160
Raj, you're a real hero.

1300
01:25:15,161 --> 01:25:20,319
Had Tanvi not married
you today, I would have!

1301
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,879
You are a changed person, Sameer.

1302
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,999
You were irritating and stupid earlier

1303
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,880
but now you're
completely the opposite.

1304
01:25:27,881 --> 01:25:29,879
Stupid and irritating!

1305
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,718
So now if all your errands are done,
can I go and get married?

1306
01:25:31,719 --> 01:25:33,278
Raj, one last favour brother, please?

1307
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:34,920
I don't believe this, now what?

1308
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:37,959
Actually this car is
for you and Tanvi,

1309
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:43,839
so now when you get it
please act a little surprised.

1310
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:47,119
Surprised?

1311
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:47,879
Wow!

1312
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:51,279
No, that's too loud.

1313
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,319
You will never change, right?

1314
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,639
Stop!

1315
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:59,519
And Raj, another
thing I learned today.

1316
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,320
Heroes can also travel on
Chandigarh local transport buses.

1317
01:26:02,321 --> 01:26:03,239
What?

1318
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:04,120
Love you, brother.

1319
01:26:04,121 --> 01:26:12,121
Just arrive on time.

1320
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:58,960
Damn this puncture.

1321
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:08,760
Aren't the decorations outstanding?

1322
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,320
Just look at the time.

1323
01:28:55,321 --> 01:29:03,321
Relax Tej, he will be here soon.

1324
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:30,760
God bless you.

1325
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:39,960
My dearest son Raj, you have
always been my favourite child.

1326
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:42,399
Correct.

1327
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:50,400
You've given me the best
present of my life by marrying Tanvi.

1328
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:55,759
I would like to return this gesture.

1329
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:58,919
Just a moment.

1330
01:29:58,920 --> 01:29:59,420
Sameer.

1331
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:04,860
Sameer.

1332
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:18,360
Sameer!

1333
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:59,920
Thank God for being on time.

1334
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:10,679
So from my side,

1335
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:18,680
congratulations.

1336
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:26,319
Wow, I am so surprised.

1337
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,000
But I am sorry, dad,
I cannot accept this.

1338
01:31:29,001 --> 01:31:32,199
But why, son?

1339
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,879
Excuse the impertinence,

1340
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:36,038
but had Shalini mummy's
dad given you something

1341
01:31:36,039 --> 01:31:37,838
like this, would you have accepted it?

1342
01:31:37,839 --> 01:31:39,360
Of course.
- Shut up, idiot!

1343
01:31:39,361 --> 01:31:40,759
What's he saying?

1344
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,559
Continue please!

1345
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,039
Dad, please, I cannot accept this.

1346
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:48,159
But...
- Please.

1347
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:51,520
In fact I love this car so much
that I want to buy it for Tanvi,

1348
01:31:51,521 --> 01:31:57,239
but with my own money.

1349
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:00,399
Please, dad, don't mind.

1350
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,879
Please, dad, don't mind.

1351
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:07,959
Family picture, people, come on fast.

1352
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:09,999
Come on everyone.

1353
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,119
Dad, but where is Gattu?

1354
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:20,120
Oh forget it!

1355
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,639
Greetings everyone.

1356
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:36,199
Greetings everyone.

1357
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:42,959
Uncle Sameer is running late, so
I thought I would bring the car.

1358
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:50,960
He's so poor, still made it on time.

1359
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:18,520
You here?

1360
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,999
You brought the car?

1361
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,919
Then whose car has Sameer got?

1362
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:34,920
Actually dad... that day...
when the car arrived...

1363
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,640
Uncle, actually Sameer and
Gattu are at the hospital.

1364
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:09,439
Poverty was making Gattu feel faint!

1365
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:13,679
So I thought I'll only get the car.

1366
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:21,680
You also brought the car?

1367
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:33,519
One wedding, three cars?

1368
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:37,559
What is going on?

1369
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:41,719
Sameer, come here you fool.

1370
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:44,119
He's coming!

1371
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:50,159
What chaos have you created?

1372
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:54,999
Actually dad, that
morning when the car arrived,

1373
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I had a party in my college, so I...

1374
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,119
Love is priceless and free.

1375
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:23,559
Gattu won his car in a lucky draw.

1376
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:27,519
And he also finally did it properly.

1377
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:31,120
Dahiya senior got emotional
and gave his car to Jasleen

1378
01:35:31,121 --> 01:35:33,599
for saving his son's life.

1379
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,840
Now how would I know that the God
of luxury cars would be so pleased

1380
01:35:36,841 --> 01:35:39,519
that he would line up cars here?

1381
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,799
Cool down, Teju, it will be fine.

1382
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:47,799
Useless burger.

1383
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:53,239
Is the car more important or you?

1384
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:56,199
I can always get another car

1385
01:35:56,200 --> 01:36:00,679
but never another son.

1386
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:02,599
I am really sorry, dad,

1387
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,599
I know I screwed up,
I am really sorry.

1388
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:11,319
Really sorry!

1389
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:16,919
For the last three nights you kids have
been running amongst goons and cops.

1390
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:20,279
Had something gone wrong, then what?

1391
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:23,959
Next time such a thing happens,

1392
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:29,719
call me immediately.

1393
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:33,639
I will beat you up first,

1394
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:38,279
but eventually I will be
the one solving your problem.

1395
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:46,280
Got it?
- Yes, dad.

1396
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:53,039
This is for you.

1397
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:59,199
Glad you grew up.

1398
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:04,279
Useless burg... bugger.

1399
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:07,319
I know English as well.

1400
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:13,359
Now give me a hug.

1401
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,039
