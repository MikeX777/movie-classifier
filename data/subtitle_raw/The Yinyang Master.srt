[Qingming] Brother Cimu…

Cimu.

14

What did you do to him?

15
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,625
Nothing.
A demon escaped the Sealing Chamber.

16
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,083
And tried to steal the Scale Stone.

17

that you escaped untouched?

00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,375
I didn't do it.

[Qingming]
When Pangu separated heaven and Earth,

38
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,208
humans and demons
initially live together in harmony.

39
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,333
But then an evil demon named Xiangliu,

40
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,541
proclaimed himself
to be the Demon Emperor.

41
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,750
The nine-headed serpent
seduced the demons

42
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,291
into wreaking havoc upon the mortal world.

43
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,583
Fortunately, a group
of Yin Yang Masters fought back.

44
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,541
They forged a sacred weapon,

45
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,625
the Tushan Sword.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,833
With it, they slay Xiangliu

while demons strolled
in the Monster Realm.

51
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,291
Both sides kept to themselves.

52
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,166
Whenever a demon crosses the border,

53
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,333
a Yin Yang master is treated as a part
of the Demon Emperor's army.

54
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,958

My failure must be punished.

257
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,041
We took the Scale Stone from the Bureau,

258
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,458
but then we ran into three rat demons.

259
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,416
I don't know who gave them the order,

260
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,500
but someone must have told them
to intercept the Scale Stone.

261
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,916
You said three rat demons?

262
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,500
They must be Qingming's ferrets.

263
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,916
What were they doing there?

264
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,541
[breathes heavily]

265
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,416
Your job was very easy.

266
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,250
How did you ruin it?

267
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,916
[gasping]

268
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,791
The Raven Hound twins.

269
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,208
Monster Realm's greatest warriors.

270
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,333
They said you could never fail.

271
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,625
Turns out…

272
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,791
they were wrong.

273
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,166
But then again,
the Scale Stone has been removed.

274
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,416
I suppose the Raven Hounds
have at least achieved something.

275
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,708
You can die in peace now.

276
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,541

that you can make up for things

277

just because you got back in tribute,

278
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,208
Master took you in
because he expects great things from you

279
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,458
but if you slack off,
you will be punished.

288
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,458
Lift your arms.

00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,958
-Harder. What are you aiming at?

00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,541
[woman] Remember,
Master has graciously taken you in

292
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,541
to be the Spirit Guardians.

293
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:19,083
If not for him, you will all be out now
wandering alone, bullied.

294
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,666
-Shh.
-[woman] Don't take this lightly.

295
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,166

00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,166

[both gibber]

303
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,833

309
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,500

[Xiangliu growls]

315
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,166
[Xiangliu] We meet again, Qingming.

316
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,791
The Scale Stone has finally been removed
from the control of the Bureau.

317
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,416
You will help me return
to the mortal world.

318
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,541
That is your destiny.

319
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,583
Do you understand, Qingming?

320
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,125
[gasps]

321
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,041
[exhales]

322
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,958
-[Qingming panting]
-[ferret grumbling]

323
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,875
I summon the light of Purple Star
for protection.

324
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,708
Has something happened here?

325
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,833
Look after the ferret.

326
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:08,708
Something might have happened to
Scale Stone. I'm going to Monster Realm.

327
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,666
[ferret gibbers]

328
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,166
[people chanting]

329
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,791
[man]
Removing the Scale Stone from the Bureau

330
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,916
has wreaked havoc on the Sealing Chamber.

331
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,625
The Defenders have tried to contain it
with sigils all night to no avail.

332
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,041
I refuse to believe
it was merely a coincidence,

333
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,333
that those who stole the Scale Stone
were all Qingming's cohorts.

334
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,375
It is obvious

335
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,875
that he came back to finish
what he failed to do seven years ago.

336
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,458
Losing the Scale Stone is disastrous
for the Bureau.

337
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:43,416
It's hard to fend off a thief
who lives among us.

338
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,583
If Qingming didn't betray the Bureau,

339
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,791
how did the Raven Hounds
access the restricted area?

340
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,583
How could they have known the spells
to destroy the golden pagoda?

341
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,750
As soon as the Scale Stone was stolen,

342
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,708
the three rat demons were there.

343
00:22:57,083 --> 00:23:00,375
The Bureau should have apprehended
that traitor long ago,

344
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,208
had the Chief been able
to make a decision…

345
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,541
Xican.

346
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,875
…that demon would be roaming
wherever he pleases.

347
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:09,166
Elder, you don't need to worry
about my past with Qingming.

348
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,583
-I didn't want you to forget.
-Elder Xican.

349
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,875
Choose your words carefully.

350
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,041
I have my own thoughts
on the Scale Stone issue.

351
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,458
[Xican grumbles]

352
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,750
[Xican] A hundred years ago,

353
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,875
helpless elders at the Bureau
took it upon themselves

354
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,333
and sacrificed their lives

355
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,458
to finally slay the demon, Xiangliu.

356
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,166
But the evil serpent had nine heads

357
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,000
and its power was immense.

358
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,083
And although its body was destroyed,

359
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,916
its spirit could never be eradicated.

360
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,583
They could only reduce it
into the Scale Stone

361
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,500
which was then sealed inside this pagoda.

362
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,708
And so…

363
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:51,166
defending the golden pagoda
and safeguarding the Scale Stone

364
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,208
are the two greatest duties
of the Yin Yang Bureau.

365
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,583
One day, it will be your turn.

366
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,375
And you can never relax in your duties.

367
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,250
Cimu.

368
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,625
Lead the chant
to ward off the evil spirits.

369
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,000

Don't say that.
Qingming will be a Yin Yang Master.

He was abandoned as a baby,
we barely know anything about him.

-Shut up. That's an order.

Brother Cimu,
I will not let your death be for nothing.

00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:11,333
Qingming has left us no choice
by doing this.

410
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:12,916
We brought shame on the Bureau

411
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,458
by failing to apprehend that traitor
for the past seven years.

412
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,708
Even if we have to scour
the entire Monster Realm,

we will bring him to justice.

What order?

418
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,416
I must go to the Yin Yang Bureau,

423

Why would they care about
the imperial tribute?

Seventh-Rank secondary captain Yuan Boya

nothing but your ambition.

But in the end, you're just a nobody
who doesn't know his limits.

432
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:13,041
I'm going to capture that demon now.
And then you'll see who's the nobody.

Do you know where he lives?

the Yin Yang Master, Qingming.

That's him. I fought him yesterday.

Isn't that exactly
what I just said to you?

[Shenle] Let go of me.

544
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:39,708
[Shenle] Huh?

There's the path. You see?

554
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,500
It takes time for the spell to work.

555
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,083
If you're going to be stupid,
just keep your mouth shut.

556
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:44,583
What are you doing?
We have to go now or we won't make it.

557
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,833
What?

558
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,500

Plum-infused water.
To mask our human scent.

563

Why didn't you do that before?

564
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:25,041

-Come on, focus.

Can you focus on the job, please?

-[Shenle] It's a gift.

I like it.

Master, I've finally found you.

00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,625
Uh, here's a gift to introduce myself.
Please accept it.

I finally caught up with you, you coward.

-Ow. Ah…
-Back off.

611
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,208
Leave him alone.

612
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:54,041
Master, this guardsman wants to hurt you.

613
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:56,291
I came to warn you. So don't forget it.

614

I know what you are, freak.
And I, Yuan Boya, am taking you in.

Whoa.

616
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,833
What was your name again?

-[Shenle grunts]
-Yuan Boya.

of the Capital Guards.

-Is this how you write?
-[Boya] Let go of me.

Oh, using evil magic… [groans]

00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:23,958
-Spirit Guardian sigil.
-What sigil?

626
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,291
Spirit Guardian.

627
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,333
What is that? [groans]

628
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:28,291
Oh, hey…

629
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,666
-Cast the Spirit Guardian sigil on me too.
-[grunts]

630
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,500
-Cast it on me too, Master.
-Why can't I control my arms and legs?

631
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:36,208
-I'm willing to give my life to you.
-Remove the spell now.

633
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,000
Whoa.

00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,291
Oh.

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,166
Mm.

647
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,791
Mm.

650
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,791
What an honored guest.

651
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:03,250
Welcome. Welcome.

652
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,125
It hasn't been long

653
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:09,708
but feels like forever.

654
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:14,291
Your familiars sent me two carts
of offering yesterday.

655
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:16,541
Today, you're here in person.

656
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,666
I wonder

657
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,583
if you brought me even more treasure.

658
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:22,541
Actually…

659
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:24,916
I need something from you.

660
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:28,916
Giving and taking brings opportunities.

661
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,708
-So, what do you want?
-The Tushan Sword.

662
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:32,875
[gasps]

663
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:35,958
[coughs]
That name is taboo in the Monster Realm.

664
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,208
Why would I have it?

665
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:43,458
-Think carefully before you answer.
-[gasps] My precious gems!

666
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:46,375
After you pledged your allegiance
to the Bureau,

667
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:48,750
you borrowed the sword to dominate
the Monster Realm

668
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:49,875
but you never returned it.

669
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:52,666
-[plays note]
-[Qingming] Still wanna play dumb?

670
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:56,125
[laughs]

671
00:39:57,416 --> 00:40:00,833
Such a trivial matter.
Not sure why you'd even remember it.

672
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:03,916
[gulps]

673
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:08,166
The Tushan Sword slayed the Demon Emperor
Xiangliu a hundred years ago

674
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,583
and the Monster Realm
still hasn't recovered.

675
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:12,791
Once the Demon Emperor was gone,

676
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:15,083
nobody cared much about the sword anymore.

677
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:17,000
So, what do you want with it now?

678
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,208
[Qingming] The Emperor's body perished
but its spirit lives on.

679
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:22,458
It never hurts to be prepared
for the worst.

680
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:25,125
But I can't afford to offend the Bureau.

681
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:27,333
Hey. Stop.

682
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:28,666
You can't bully me.

683
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,041
You're in the Monster Realm,
this is my turf.

684
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:34,458
I am the boss here and what I say…

685
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:35,416
No!

686
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,333
Be reasonable.

687
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:39,750
[Port Master laughs]

688
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:45,750
Fine, let's negotiate
but you have to make me a decent offer.

689
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,375
How about two live humans?

690
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:50,833
Oh.

691
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,666
"Live humans"?

692
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,750
So does this offer sound better now?

693
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:59,083
[crowd cheering]

694
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:04,708
Kill that human, don't stand there!

695
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:09,916
[Shenle] Master!

696
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,541
-[Shenle] Master!
-[man] Yeah!

697
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:15,916
[Shenle] Master, look here!

698
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,375
[Shenle] Master!

699
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:20,000
[men grunting]

[Boya groans]

702
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:30,833
Hey. [screams]

703
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:35,291

[grunts]

708
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,208
[Shenle] Yuan Boya, watch out!

709
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,708
Let her go! Right now!

710
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:00,250
Don't worry about me!

711
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,208
[groans]

712
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:05,291
My dear demons and thieves,

713
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:08,791
prepare to witness a fight that lights up
which you've never seen.

714
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:13,083
Man versus demon in a battle to the death!

715
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:17,625
Place your bets now
for this once-in-a-lifetime showdown!

716
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:20,833
[announcer] Hey, captain or whatever.

717
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,500
You better give it your best.

718
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:25,875
Otherwise, your little pal dies.

719
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:28,416
-[door opening]
-[announcer cackling]

720
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:36,041
[announcer]
May I present to you the Red Ghost Demon.

721
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:38,458
Born and raised in this very arena,

722
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:40,875
he has never lost a fight.

00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:33,583
[Red Ghost coughs]

907
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:35,916
[Shenle gasps] What's he doing here?

908
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:37,833
[Red Ghost retches]

909
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:44,000
[Boya] Well… where are we now?

910
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:46,125
[Qingming panting]

911
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:48,125
[gasping]

912
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:52,000
[woman] Huh?

913
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:55,791
[Shenle] This is Master's home.

914
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:58,416
That bandit lives here?
So this is where he hides his loot.

915
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,750
[laughing]

916
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:01,625
-[monsters growl]
-[Shenle gasps]

917
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:06,333
[Shenle] Wait, stop. Stop it.
We're on the same side.

918
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:09,416
Did you think that following Master
would make you one of us?

919
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,500
[pants]

920
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:13,958
Who wants to be one of you?
You think I don't recognize you?

921
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:17,250
You're the filthy little thieves
who stole the imperial tribute.

922
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,625
Who are you calling a thief?
I'll rip out your tongue.

923
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:22,708
-[Boya grunts]
-Quiet.

924
00:56:22,791 --> 00:56:24,291
-[Boya mumbling]
-Sister.

925
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:27,250
-Please, forgive this stupid human.
-[both groan]

926
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:28,708
[woman] They are guests.

927
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:31,583
[monsters gibber]

928
00:56:32,416 --> 00:56:33,791
Bring them inside.

929
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:35,333
[relieved sighing]

930
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,625
Thank you so much.

931
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:39,250
We'll just have a look around.

932
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:41,291
Don't mind us. We're not even here.

933
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:42,208
[Boya] Thanks.

934
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:51,000
[noble music playing]

935
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:52,958
[Qingming chanting]

936
00:56:57,875 --> 00:57:01,583
[delicate music plays]

937
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:22,500
[Qingming] Baini.

938
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:27,708
Is there really no place for me
at the Bureau?

939
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:33,625
-What's that?
-[Baini] It's a token.

940
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:35,375
That's for girls. I don't want it.

941
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:38,375
This bracelet will let me cast
a Spirit Guardian sigil on you.

942
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,583
The sigil's only for demons.

943
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:41,583
I'm a human.

944
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,583
You're also half-demon so that counts.

945
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:44,916
I'm not a demon.

946
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,500
And I'll never be one.

947
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:48,666
Qingming, it's okay if you are.

948
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:51,541
Be my Spirit Guardian,
and I'll be your master.

949
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:53,125
Don't you know about that?

950
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,916
Once a demon has a master,

951
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,458
it knows it has a home,

952
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,333
and they will never become evil.

953
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:02,916
[delicate music continues]

954
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,833
[Boya] Well…

955
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,791
I…

956
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:08,833
Qingming…

957
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:10,958
from this day forward,

958
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:12,458
am Baini's guardian.

959
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:17,500
We now live and die as one
and we shall never betray each other.

960
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:22,833
[Baini] Never betray each other.

961
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:32,375
[coughs]

962
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:34,750
[grunts]

963
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:38,916
-[groans]
-Careful with those wounds.

964
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:42,375
I promise…

965
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:45,833
-I'll help you find the truth.
-Your promise…

966
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:47,625
is worthless.

967
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:49,166
If that's true…

968
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:52,083
why would you take this one for me then?

969
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,833
I've been looking for the Scale Stone.

970
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:58,875
Your demons have been a nuisance
for years. Everyone knows that.

971
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:01,375
You're definitely involved in this.

972
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:04,083
All the demons here
have the same fate I do.

973
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,333
We're not allowed in the capital city
and don't belong in the Monster Realm.

974
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:10,166
We're outsiders,

975
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,541
living as thieves.

976
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:12,666
Trying to survive

977
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,583
-the only way we know how--
-So now it means you and the demons?

978
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,458
You promised
that we would always be you and me.

979
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,375
But you chose to leave the path
and ruined everything.

980
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:32,583
[Qingming] I left the Bureau

981
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:34,166
because I had no other choice.

982
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,666
That night, seven years ago,

983
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,916
it was my turn to guard
the Scale Stone ward.

984
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,458
I bumped in to Brother Cimu.

985
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:41,958
Qingming.

986
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:45,666
[Qingming] He was concerned
about my well-being as always.

987
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,583
Brother Cimu.

988
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:50,750
Are you still being troubled
by Xiangliu's spirit?

989
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,333
During the ghost festival,

990
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:57,541
it's especially bad.

991
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:59,833
Thankfully, you taught me
that protection spell.

992
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:01,333
I've been chanting it a lot lately.

993
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,541
You can't afford to cause
any more trouble.

994
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,666
If you truly lose control someday…

995
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:12,666
reverse the incantation
and destroy yourself.

996
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,375
So Xiangliu doesn't possess you.

997
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:17,500
"Reverse the protection spell"?

998
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:20,500
I'll guard the Ward for you tonight.

999
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:35,166
Return to the unity,
purity from within and without.

1000
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:36,833
[Qingming] Little did I realize

1001
01:00:36,916 --> 01:00:39,875
that the evil spirit
would be especially violent that night.

1002
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:43,291
I knew…

1003
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,708
that something serious must have happened.

1004
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:47,666
…purity from within and without.

1005
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,958

[ominous music playing]

1007
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:53,833
The Golden Pagoda?

1008
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:02,000
[Qingming] Inside the ward,
there were bodies everywhere.

1009
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:03,541
I tried to find Brother Cimu,

1010
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:06,291
but the Golden Pagoda had melted.

1011
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:09,250
[gasps]

1012
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,166
The evil spirit inside the Scale Stone

1013
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,625
was driving me insane.

1014
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,958
[monster cackles]

1015
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,666
[Xiangliu] Qingming, you're pathetic.

1016
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:28,666
You're seen as nothing more than a freak
in the human world.

1017
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,833
but little did you know

1018
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:33,791
that you belong to the rarest
and most precious bloodline.

1019
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:36,875
Purity from within and without.
This order shall break the seal!

1020
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:39,625
[Xiangliu] Don't bother
with that useless incantation.

1021
01:01:39,708 --> 01:01:40,958
You are a demon.

1022
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:44,666
You and I are connected with my blood.

1023
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,041
[woman]
Another one has gone for the Scale Stone.

1024
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:50,375
[gasps]

1025
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,041
-Hmm.
-[Qingming] It was the Snow Queen.

1026
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:57,500
She was supposed to be locked
in the Sealing Chamber.

1027
01:01:57,583 --> 01:01:59,333
How did she get inside the Ward?

1028
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:02,750
-Brother. Brother!
-Qingming, get out.

1029
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:05,208
[Qingming]
That was the last time I saw Brother Cimu.

1030
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:08,875
[grunts]

1031
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,916

01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:14,625
[Qingming screams]

1033
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:18,791
[Qingming]
I had no choice but to defend myself,

1034
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:22,625
then I saw that Brother Cimu had been
torn to pieces by my counterattack.

1035
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:25,041
And the Snow Queen had disappeared.

1036
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:27,458
[Qingming gasps]

1037
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:30,875
[guards panting]

1038
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:35,291
No one has wanted to find her
more than I have these past seven years.

1039
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,250
"The Snow Queen"?

1040
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,375
There's nobody else besides you
who could send demons into the Ward.

1041
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:44,166
Seven years ago,
Brother Cimu died because of you.

1042
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:48,041
Seven years later, people at the Bureau
died because of you again.

1043
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:50,083
You're not innocent in this.

1044
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:54,208
If you're so sure it's me…

1045
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:56,791
why do you still have our token?

1046
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,333
Give it back.

1047

[Boya] Huh?

1051
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,875
-There it is again.
-[door bangs]

1052
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:19,666
-Something's in there.
-Wait.

1053
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:21,958
You can't touch anything in the courtyard.

1054
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:24,666
Wanna bet I can?

1055
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,458
-Hey.
-Maybe that's the beheaded tribute.

1071

What do you have to say now?

1078
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:18,166
If the Bureau had done its job
and protected the Scale Stone,

1079
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,500
the Ferret would still be alive.

1080
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,583
I won't bother with you all tonight.

1081
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:28,416
You and your demon friends
can have a few more days of peace.

1082
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,833
But when I return,
I'm going to destroy this place.

[gibbering]

1085
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:04,666
[Shenle]
The life of a demon, it needs a master.

1086
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,500
So it has a home,

1087
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:08,833
it doesn't become evil.

1088
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:11,375
[inhales deeply]

1089
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:12,500
But back then…

1090
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,000
my demon sisters…

1091
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:17,291
didn't even get to be buried.

1092
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:18,833
Your demon sisters?

1093
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,666
[Shenle] I was born an orphan.

1094
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,458
I had to beg for food. One time…

1095
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,833
I was chased by a ferocious dog.

1096
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:29,208
Ended up passing out
in front of a big house.

1097
01:06:29,916 --> 01:06:32,208
There was an amazing smell
coming out of it.

1098
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:34,333
I felt energized all of a sudden.

1099
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,916
The pain from my wounds was gone.

1100
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,291
You were dreaming, weren't you?

1101
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:42,083
It was even better than a dream.

1102
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:44,541
It was called the Courtyard.

1103
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,166
"The Courtyard"?

1104
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:49,166
Wait, are you talking about
the famous brothel?

1105
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:52,916
Why were you so happy to end up there?

1106
01:06:53,541 --> 01:06:54,875
It was wonderful.

1107
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,250
The sisters treated me so well.

1108

[blows nose]

1110
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:11,500
And when I was seven…

1111
01:07:13,916 --> 01:07:15,416
-the Bureau came.
-[Red Ghost snores]

1112
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:19,333
They told me that my sisters
were all demons hiding in the city.

1113
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:22,000
They weren't allowed
to stay there anymore.

1114
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,208
Those who cooperated were sealed away.

1115
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,833
Those who resisted
were slaughtered on the spot.

1116
01:07:31,416 --> 01:07:32,583
But that time…

1117
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,916
there was a young man with them.

1118
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:36,833
He was shivering.

1119
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:39,583
He was a Yin Yang Master,

1120
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:43,208
but he didn't harm any of my sisters.

1121
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:47,041
Instead, he just held me in his arms

1122
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:50,000
and gave me one of my sisters' umbrellas.

1123
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:52,291
That was the day

1124
01:07:52,916 --> 01:07:55,000
I decided he would be my master.

1125
01:07:56,083 --> 01:07:57,750
Wherever master went…

1126
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,833
that's what I'd call home.

1127
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:02,625
[Qingmin] I am no one's master.

1128
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:06,208
You really have an urge to say that?

1129
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:07,583
You're the problem.

1130
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:11,125
[Boya] If you're a demon,
why would you become a Yin Yang Master?

1131
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:12,958
If you're a human,

1132
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:15,041
why do you keep those demons around?

1133
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:17,375
-It's ridiculous.
-We were both abandoned.

1134
01:08:18,458 --> 01:08:19,666
No need to insult each other.

1135
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:22,500
-You're comparing yourself to me?
-Aren't we both…

1136
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:24,541

1137
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:25,541
Hmm?

1138

-Drink with me.
-[Boya] Hmph.

1140
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:32,208
[Qingming] What's wrong?

1141
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:34,083
Afraid I'd poisoned the wine?

1142
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,833
-Do you think I'm afraid of you?
-Yuan Boya.

1143
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:40,083
[Shenle] Stop it.

to keep her from going back.

and putting this case to rest.

1156

has called me a traitor.

1157
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,875
Yet you still believe

1158
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,583
that I will keep my promise.

1159
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:52,500
Then why…

1160
01:09:54,083 --> 01:09:55,750
would I not believe you?

1161

-you should make a toast to master.
-Hmm?

Did you think you beat him
all by yourself?

that helped you win.

-Master, can I have it too?

01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:27,333

If you think humans are so bad,

1184
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:53,625
that means half of your master is bad too.

If I think demons are stupid,

01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:40,583
We live and die as one,

1258
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:42,833
and shall never betray each other.

1259
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:46,750
I won't be long.

1260
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,666
[retreating footsteps]

1261
01:15:52,416 --> 01:15:54,750
[sighs]

1262
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:05,000
[foreboding music plays]

1263
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:11,000
[Qingming]
Was your master too afraid to show up?

1264
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:13,000
Patience.

1265
01:16:14,208 --> 01:16:16,333
You will kneel before him shortly.

1266
01:16:17,416 --> 01:16:19,791
The whole world will kneel before him.

1267
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,750
[grunts]

1268
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:33,583
[Baini] Who's there?

1269
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:36,166
[man] The Scale Stone doesn't belong
to the human world.

1270
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:38,833
It's been away from its rightful place
for too long.

1271
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:42,083
If that's true, then where does it belong?

1272
01:16:42,166 --> 01:16:45,541
[man] In the hands of the world's
most powerful demon, of course.

1273
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:49,500
[grunts]

1274
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,750
[gags]

1275
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:55,958
It doesn't matter who your master is.

1276
01:16:56,041 --> 01:16:58,500
Today, you'll finally pay your debt.

1277
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:03,000
[Snow Queen grunts]

1278
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:05,791
[Qingming grumbles]

1279
01:17:16,208 --> 01:17:17,666
[gasps]

1280
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:19,166
[exhales]

1281
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:35,833
[Snow Queen whimpers]

1282
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:38,875
[sword clangs]

1283
01:17:38,958 --> 01:17:40,916
[Snow Queen] You really are a fool.

1284
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:44,625
The master looked after you at the Bureau.

1285
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:49,375
Weren't you always very grateful to him?

1286
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:52,958
Cimu.

1287
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:55,791
[Baini gasping]

1288
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:05,583
I joined the Bureau at the age of nine.

1289
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:08,583
At 30,

1290
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,916
I became the youngest Defender ever.

1291
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,666
But for what?

1292
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,500
At that point, the Bureau
had nothing more to offer me.

1293
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:18,333
Travelling to the mortal world…

1294
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:22,083
in my eyes, you were nothing
but distractions.

1295
01:18:22,916 --> 01:18:24,750
I understand your obsession with Qingming,

1296
01:18:26,583 --> 01:18:28,583
but I have my own obsession.

1297
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:36,750
[Cimu] The freak who'd been abandoned
by everyone existed for only one reason.

1298
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:39,791
To show me the true strength
in demonic power.

1299
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:44,166
[Cimu chuckles]

1300
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:46,333
If little Qingming could possess it…

1301
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:50,958
then with Xiangliu's aid…

1302
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:55,125
what could possibly be out of my reach?

1303
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:57,541
[grunting]

1304
01:18:58,458 --> 01:18:59,708
What I want…

1305
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:01,583
is the power of the Scale Stone.

1306
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:04,375
[groans]

1307
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:13,500
Master Cimu…

1308
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,250
is the savior

1309
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:18,125
for both of us.

1310
01:19:24,791 --> 01:19:26,625

1311
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:34,041

1314
01:19:58,125 --> 01:20:00,666
[Snow Queen]
Do you hear the master's call?

1315
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:02,041
You're lying.

1316
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:03,541
[Snow Queen wheezes]

1317
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:05,083
I know what I saw that night.

1318
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,458
I watched Broher Cimu die

1319
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:09,875
right in front of me.

1320
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:11,250
Just a simple illusion.

1321
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:12,458
[gasps]

1322
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:18,500
Master.

1323
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:22,708
SNOW QUEEN

1324
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:28,625
[majestic music playing]

[Snow Queen moans]

1326
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:36,625
I, the Snow Queen, hereby vow

1327
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,375
that I shall serve

1328
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:42,166
Master Cimu forever.

1329
01:20:45,125 --> 01:20:46,666
Greatness will be yours.

1330
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,125
I…

1331
01:20:49,666 --> 01:20:51,333
I wish I could be there

1332
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:53,083
to see you…

1333
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,041
achieve it.

1334
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:11,250
[growling]

1335
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:31,250
[demon growls]

1336
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:33,500
Show me the road.

1337
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:37,708

[girl screams] Mommy!

1343
01:22:21,083 --> 01:22:25,416
Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy…

[girl screams]

1345
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:30,375
I want to go home.

1346

Mommy…

1347
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,583
I want to go home.

1348
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:42,958
I wish I'd been alive
till the Demon Emperor's reign,

1349
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,333
but I was born too late

1350
01:22:44,416 --> 01:22:46,750
and I had to become the Bureau's lapdog.

1351
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:50,625
But if the Demon Emperor were to return,
I would gladly sacrifice my life for him.

Where is my wine?

1355
01:23:01,708 --> 01:23:04,000
More wine for me. More wine.

1356
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:06,083
-[Shenle] Why are you still lying there?
-[grunting]

1357
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:08,500
Unless you wanna become a barbecue,
we have to move now.

[Shenle groans]

1359
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:12,166
[Boya] Barbecue? Where is the barbecue?

1360
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:13,208
[ferret squeaks]

1361
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:18,791
-[Shenle] Let's go.
-[groans]

1362
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:20,208
Huh?

1363
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:21,875
What the heck is that?

1364
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:24,625
Oh, what happened here?

1365
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:27,708
What is going on?

1366
01:23:30,416 --> 01:23:32,166
Cover your nose and mouth with the sigil

1367
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:33,958
to protect you from mutating.

1368
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:36,041

01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:38,541
-[Shenle] Give me one too.
-Humans don't need it.

1370
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:39,500
What?

1371
01:23:39,583 --> 01:23:40,625
Why is that?

1372
01:23:40,708 --> 01:23:42,958
An evil demon has acquired the Scale Stone

1373
01:23:43,041 --> 01:23:44,750
and opened the gateway
to the Monster Realm.

1374
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:47,541
Hordes of demons will soon be invading.

1375
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:48,541
Invading?

1376
01:23:48,625 --> 01:23:49,750
-Why?
-[woman] For years,

1377
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:51,041
Master has trained you for war

1378
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:54,000
because he never forgot his duties
as a Yin Yang Master.

1379
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:55,125
And now…

1380
01:23:55,916 --> 01:23:57,166
we'll honor him

1381
01:23:57,708 --> 01:23:59,875
-and protect the Capital City.
-Capital?

1385
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:08,625
fight until your last breath.

1386
01:24:15,916 --> 01:24:17,375
We've burned our garden.

1387
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:19,750
There's no retreat for us.

1388
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:21,875

-[Red Ghost grunts]
-Uh…

1393
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:34,375
You're using this as a cover to escape.

1394
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:36,000
You are not one of us.

1395
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:37,708
Go back to the Capital Guards.

01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:53,000
-Keep an eye on them?
-[gibbers]

1405

1412
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:33,208
[Qingming] Brother Cimu,

1413
01:25:34,166 --> 01:25:35,291
I have a question for you.

1414
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:39,000
[Cimu] We're not at the Bureau.

1415
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:41,666
So…

1416
01:25:43,708 --> 01:25:44,875
no need for brother.

1417
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:49,125
[Qingming] Seven years ago,
you were the Bureau's Defender

1418
01:25:49,208 --> 01:25:51,666
yet you conspire with the Snow Queen.

1419
01:25:52,208 --> 01:25:53,583
to slaughter your brothers

1420
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:56,041
and steal the Scale Stone.

1421
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:59,458
Purity from within and without,
this order shall break the seal!

1422
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:09,208
[Snow Queen] Master. A human body
can't handle the Stone's power.

1423
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:11,166
Only a demon's can.

1424
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:12,166
[Cimu] Stay back.

1425
01:26:14,833 --> 01:26:15,750

-Master, let it go. Let it go.

01:26:21,666 --> 01:26:23,916
-[grunting]
-Or it will kill you.

We need to go now.

[Qingming gasps]

1432
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,625
Another one has come for the Scale Stone.

Mm-hmm.

[Cimu] Sure, I lost an arm,

1439
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:05,833
but its replacement was far superior.
So it was worth it.

[continues playing lute]

1441
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,166
You were the one

1442
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:12,333
who showed me the true power of demons.

1443
01:27:13,916 --> 01:27:16,166
Yet you did not know how to follow
your true nature.

1444
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:19,291
That's why you're in this pathetic
predicament now.

1445
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:22,166
[Qingming] Actually, I think you,

1446
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,750
Brother Cimu,

1447
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:25,291
are far more pathetic.

Maybe my guard…

1451

can take you in.

1452

[Cimu] Take me in?

1453
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,708
I answered Xiangliu's call.

1454
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:50,250
I tortured myself

1455
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:53,541
to create this demonic form,

1456
01:27:54,416 --> 01:27:56,625
and now I have the power
of the Scale Stone.

1457
01:27:58,958 --> 01:28:00,375
Which makes you…

1458
01:28:01,875 --> 01:28:03,958

1459
01:28:04,041 --> 01:28:05,333
Xiangliu called to you?

1460
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:09,875
Yes, and he told me
that it was my destiny.

1461
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,500
To be the strongest being on Earth.

1462
01:28:15,375 --> 01:28:17,208
And if anyone in the human world

1463
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:19,500
or Monster Realm ever dared to defy me,

1464
01:28:19,583 --> 01:28:20,666

Destroy the bridge!

1619
01:38:21,958 --> 01:38:24,250
Even if it takes us with it.
We can't let them pass!

1620

[gasps]

1625
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:42,541
Wake up.

1626
01:38:43,791 --> 01:38:45,000
[exhales]

1627
01:38:45,708 --> 01:38:46,541
Baini?

1628
01:38:47,625 --> 01:38:49,166
[Qingming] What is this place?

1629
01:38:52,208 --> 01:38:53,208
Thankfully…

1630
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,166
-you kept your promise.
-[exhales]

1631
01:38:56,916 --> 01:38:59,083
I've been waiting for you for a while.

1632
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:02,125
Forget your demon friends.

1633
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:04,291
Forget the Bureau and Pingjing City.

1634
01:39:04,791 --> 01:39:06,291
There's only you and me.

1635
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:08,875
We'll be together forever.

1636
01:39:09,666 --> 01:39:10,500
Isn't this

1637
01:39:11,083 --> 01:39:12,333
what we always wanted?

1638
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:18,291
You are not Baini.

1639
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:20,833
Baini would never turn her back
on the mortal world.

1640
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,458
[Baini and Xiangliu]
Are you sure about that?

1641
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:25,833
[gasps]

1642
01:39:29,541 --> 01:39:30,541
[Xiangliu] Demon.

1643
01:39:31,666 --> 01:39:33,583
[Xiangliu growls]

1644
01:39:33,666 --> 01:39:35,541
Qingming.

1645
01:39:36,833 --> 01:39:39,791
You must replace Cimu

1646
01:39:39,875 --> 01:39:42,500
and join with me.

1647
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:46,041
[Qingming] "Replace Cimu"?

1648
01:39:46,125 --> 01:39:48,375
[Xiangliu growls]

1649
01:39:49,416 --> 01:39:51,708
[Qingming]
You were the one controlling him,

1650
01:39:51,791 --> 01:39:53,000
driving him insane.

1651
01:39:53,083 --> 01:39:55,625
[Xiangliu]
You wouldn't embrace your true nature

1652
01:39:55,708 --> 01:39:58,541
and kept refusing my call.

1653
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:02,333
Now that Cimu has pierced your heart,

1654
01:40:02,416 --> 01:40:04,958
you and I are finally connected.

1655
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:09,916
This is the perfect time for us
to become one.

1656
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,916
Why does it have to be me?

1657
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,833
[Xiangliu]
Cimu does not share my bloodline.

1658
01:40:14,916 --> 01:40:17,208
You are the only one

1659
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:21,333
who can truly bring about my resurrection.

1660
01:40:21,416 --> 01:40:22,625
[Qingming] No.

1661
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:24,791
I'd rather reverse the protection spell

1662
01:40:24,875 --> 01:40:26,333
and destroy myself

1663
01:40:26,916 --> 01:40:28,583
than become your puppet.

1664
01:40:30,541 --> 01:40:33,333
[Xiangliu] But what about them?

1665
01:40:33,416 --> 01:40:36,125
Do you want them to be destroyed as well?

1666
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:40,250

[Xiangliu snarls]

1669
01:40:49,333 --> 01:40:51,750
I once made a pact with Baini

1670
01:40:51,833 --> 01:40:54,041
that I would never become an evil demon.

1671
01:40:55,541 --> 01:41:00,375
[Xiangliu] Baini.
You also hold Baini's life in your hand.

1672
01:41:00,458 --> 01:41:01,291
[Qingming] No.

1673
01:41:01,875 --> 01:41:04,458
No! Stop it!

1674
01:41:07,333 --> 01:41:09,458
[Xiangliu growls]

1675
01:41:09,541 --> 01:41:11,666
Cimu has the power of the Scale Stone.

[Xiangliu snarls]

1677
01:41:17,041 --> 01:41:18,833
I am no match for him.

1678
01:41:18,916 --> 01:41:20,541
[Xiangliu] Join with me

1679
01:41:20,625 --> 01:41:24,083
and fully embrace your demonic nature.

1680
01:41:24,166 --> 01:41:27,291
Recognize me as your master.

1681
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:32,208
You can still achieve greatness.

1682
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:34,750
Recognize you as my master?

1683
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:39,250
[Xiangliu]
Would you rather be a weak human

1684
01:41:39,333 --> 01:41:43,208
or a demon capable of saving the world?

1685
01:41:44,291 --> 01:41:48,333
Which do you choose?

1702

We'll guard the city.

1703
01:43:09,791 --> 01:43:11,666
If it's the last thing we do.

1704
01:43:13,625 --> 01:43:15,958

Do you really think this will stop me?

1737
01:46:39,083 --> 01:46:40,958
I was supposed to control both realms

and rule over all.

1739
01:46:45,958 --> 01:46:47,791
Vanity fills your heart.

1740
01:46:48,291 --> 01:46:50,041
You have no respect for the world

1741

and no attachments to anyone or anything.

1742
01:46:53,041 --> 01:46:54,791
And you think you deserve to rule?

1743
01:46:56,083 --> 01:46:57,625

1744

1753
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:45,875
we defended the Border Bridge

1754
01:47:45,958 --> 01:47:47,875
and saved the capital,

You once promised me

1762
01:48:35,291 --> 01:48:37,833
we'd live and die as one
and never betray each other.

1763
01:48:38,416 --> 01:48:39,500
Did you forget?

1764
01:48:40,208 --> 01:48:41,291
Freak!

01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:44,500
You know that stupid sigil of yours?

1766
01:48:44,583 --> 01:48:46,666
I believe in it. And look at them.

1767
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:49,916
They were willing to die
because of their loyalty to you.

1768
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,750
[Xiangliu] Which do you choose?

1769
01:48:55,125 --> 01:48:56,416
So you used…

1770
01:48:58,041 --> 01:48:59,541
Cimu to force my hand.

1771
01:48:59,625 --> 01:49:01,875
You made him wreak havoc for both realms

1772
01:49:01,958 --> 01:49:03,791
to coerce me into joining you.

1773
01:49:03,875 --> 01:49:06,500
[Xiangliu] Yes.

01:49:07,833 --> 01:49:09,916
[Xiangliu growls]

1775
01:49:18,833 --> 01:49:22,208
Return to the unity,
purity from within and without.

1776
01:49:22,291 --> 01:49:25,458
[Xiangliu] You're actually reversing
the protection spell?

1777
01:49:26,625 --> 01:49:30,333

forever

01:49:38,416 --> 01:49:39,916

You can't do this to me! [roaring]

call me Master

1787
01:49:52,333 --> 01:49:53,541

you will continue my work,

1794
01:50:08,083 --> 01:50:10,875
you will abandon everyone
and everything you love

1795
01:50:10,958 --> 01:50:13,916
and you will forever
be an enemy to humanity.

1796
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,208
I'll ask again.

1797
01:50:19,708 --> 01:50:21,416

01:50:34,875 --> 01:50:37,750
I swear on my name, Xiangliu,

1802
01:50:37,833 --> 01:50:42,250
that I shall become Qingming's
Spirit Guardian from this day forward.

1803
01:50:42,791 --> 01:50:45,000
We will live and die as one

1804
01:50:45,083 --> 01:50:48,208
and never betray each other.

1805
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:53,458
[Xiangliu growls]

1806
01:51:01,375 --> 01:51:03,041
[Qingming groans]

1807
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,083
You're all released…

1808
01:51:23,708 --> 01:51:25,000
from my guardian spell.

1809
01:51:25,083 --> 01:51:26,583
[emotional music plays]

1810
01:51:26,666 --> 01:51:28,666
Master!

1811
01:51:30,708 --> 01:51:33,583
[Qingming] From now on,
we are no longer connected.

1812
01:51:33,666 --> 01:51:35,333
[monsters gibber]

1813
01:51:51,333 --> 01:51:54,500
[monsters jabber]

1814
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:57,041
[crying]

1815
01:52:03,875 --> 01:52:05,541
[gasps]

1816
01:52:10,791 --> 01:52:15,250
[emotional music soaring]

1817
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:43,458
[Boya] In the seventh month
of the 47th year,

1818
01:52:43,541 --> 01:52:45,375
disaster struck Pingjing City.

1819
01:52:45,458 --> 01:52:48,291
Hurricanes, tornadoes
and pestilence ravished the land.

1820
01:52:48,875 --> 01:52:51,791
At least,
that's what the historians wrote down.

1821
01:52:51,875 --> 01:52:54,500
My report, however,
told a different story.

1822
01:52:55,625 --> 01:52:58,875
The battle at the Border Bridge
decided the fate of the world.

1823
01:52:58,958 --> 01:53:00,958
And it was Qingming
and his Spirit Guardians

1824
01:53:01,041 --> 01:53:02,625
who won this impossible battle.

1825
01:53:02,708 --> 01:53:04,708
I was there purely by chance

1826
01:53:04,791 --> 01:53:06,833
but somehow emerged as a hero.

1827
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:08,833
Qingming.

1828
01:53:09,708 --> 01:53:10,958
What happened to you?

1829
01:53:12,291 --> 01:53:14,208
I fear I may never know for sure.

1830
01:53:15,458 --> 01:53:17,625
But what I do know
is that you look so determined

1831
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:19,833
when you released your Spirit Guardians.

1832
01:53:19,916 --> 01:53:22,250
And you clearly didn't have a choice.

1833
01:53:23,291 --> 01:53:25,000
[howls]

1834
01:53:27,916 --> 01:53:30,750
Your sacrifice brought peace
and prosperity to people,

1835
01:53:31,666 --> 01:53:34,333
but it also scattered your guardians
to the winds.

1836
01:53:35,291 --> 01:53:38,583
I, too, no longer have a home.

1837
01:53:40,625 --> 01:53:42,583
[all chuckle]

1838
01:53:58,375 --> 01:53:59,916
[Boya pants]

1839
01:54:07,625 --> 01:54:10,541
[noble music rising]

1840
01:54:10,625 --> 01:54:11,833
Qingming.

1841
01:54:12,416 --> 01:54:15,000
I don't care who's the master
and who's the spirit guardian,

1842
01:54:16,166 --> 01:54:18,333
we are all hoping
to see you again someday.

1843
01:54:18,833 --> 01:54:21,541
And we'll gladly follow you
wherever you wanna lead us.

1844
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,875
In the end, isn't that what it truly means
to be a Spirit Guardian?

1845
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:31,541
Sharing all sorrows and joys,
living and dying as one,

1846
01:54:32,458 --> 01:54:34,041
and never betraying each other.

1847
01:55:03,458 --> 01:55:07,791
[closing epic music plays]

1848
01:56:02,958 --> 01:56:05,750
[somber music plays]

1849
01:56:13,958 --> 01:56:18,791
[man singing Mandarin]

1850
01:58:01,291 --> 01:58:05,041
[woman singing Mandarin]

1851
02:00:00,875 --> 02:00:03,375
[ominous music plays]
