1
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,260
Come on then, come on come on

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,260
Come on then

3
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,580
Come on Kate, come on girl

4
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Come on, come and see your calf

5
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,140
Come on then girl.

6
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,340
Come on then.

7
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,380
Hello puss.

8
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,100
Come on then Kate. Come and see your calf.

9
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,940
In you go.

10
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,940
That's it.

11
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,260
How are you Kitty? Alright?

12
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,100
What's that then?
Is that a calf over there then?

13
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,900
You're a daft old thing, ain't you? Eh?

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,740
Come on.

15
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,660
Come on then.

16
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,660
That's it, push up.

17
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:02,680
Come on then. Good girl.

18
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,180
Come on then. Up you get.

19
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,860
Hello little fellow.

20
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,420
Come on then.

21
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,180
Let's put you up in the pen.

22
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,140
Come on then. That's it.

23
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,180
You're a little calf you are, aren't
you, hey? A little fellow you are.

24
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,740
Come on then.

25
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:28,780
Come on, out you come.

26
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,180
Alright.

27
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,300
Come on then little fellow.

28
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:50,020
You're as good as gold you are,
aren't you, hey?

29
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,660
Are you wondering where you're going?

30
00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Let's see your mates.

31
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Hello little fellow, a new mate for you.

32
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:21,420
That's it.

33
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,020
Here you are mate.

34
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,980
I've always drunk milk and I love our milk

35
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,300
I always have done

36
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,220
As a boy I used to drink a pint
without thinking about it

37
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,020
Whereas whenever I've stayed with
aunties or uncles in London or whatever

38
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,180
having to drink shop milk

39
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,700
it just tasted horrible

40
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,260
I just didn't really like it at all

41
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,340
Even though it is milk and I
am passionate about milk

42
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,260
The milk that the consumer
is getting in my eyes

43
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,660
Is pretty unpleasant st... well I
shouldn't say it's unpleasant stuff

44
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,300
not doing the dairy trade any
good at all but

45
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:08,320
It is not what I think milk should be.

46
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,820
Come and get your raw milk!

47
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,140
Raw milk, raw cream, raw butter

48
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,700
It tastes fantastic!

49
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,500
Come and get your organic raw milk here!

50
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,780
Hello.

51
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,420
This is raw milk, unpasteurised
milk, straight from the farm.

52
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,860
- Fantastic!
- It tastes wonderful.

53
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,460
We are quite a small herd these
days, we're 72 cows, which is quite small

54
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,380
And also our cows live a long time

55
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,500
The average age in the
country is about six years

56
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,220
Ours is about nine or ten.

57
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,140
Is it because they eat properly?

58
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,660
Because we're very relaxed with the cows

59
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,260
We don't push them hard

60
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,180
So because they are a lot
happier, they are a lot healthier

61
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,220
And that comes through in the milk

62
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,140
I'll finish it then

63
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,700
Yeah, go on - It will be good for me

64
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,620
Yeah. It is good for you!
It clears up eczema, hayfever

65
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,980
It lowers your blood cholesterol as well

66
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,700
So amazing stuff raw milk.

67
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,020
It makes you look twenty!

68
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:14,980
That's right. I'm really ninety!

69
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,620
The calf doesn't have her mum to suckle

70
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,660
It will be the first time that
she has her mums milk

71
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,780
But out of a bucket and
not straight from the mum

72
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,620
Come on then. Up you get.

73
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,220
I know your calf's in there

74
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,220
Hello little fellow!

75
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:07,940
Come on then

76
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,260
That's it. You suck my fingers!

77
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,540
They're being really excited

78
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,980
Because they know there's milk there

79
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,700
They're not sure how to get it

80
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,940
Because it is not out of a teat

81
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,940
No? It's not going to happen?

82
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,260
It is the toughest day
in the year for the mum

83
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,700
That's about it. You did pretty good.

84
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,860
Didn't you, hey?

85
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,100
So we're not so bad after all. We're
going to give you your food from now on.

86
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,380
We've looked after your girl very well

87
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,540
She knows her calf is in there

88
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,740
It's the first time she hasn't
gone in with her calf

89
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,100
But she'll be a bit upset, because she...

90
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,020
They're really talking to
each other, aren't they?

91
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,580
Yeah.

92
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,260
That, I'm afraid, is life

93
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,620
A cow has to have a calf to have milk

94
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,620
Given that situation, we have to manage
it as best as we possibly can for the cow

95
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,780
In terms of minimising its stress

96
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,300
When we separate the cow from the calf

97
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,260
But it has to be done. You
cannot have calves on cows forever

98
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:46,280
They've got to be taken off
the cow at some point

99
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,020
- Yes?
- Hello, it's milk!

100
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:38,040
Just a minute

101
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,460
This is Ida, who is on the milk bottles

102
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,060
We want to do some promotional shots in Eastbourne
where we're going to start a new milk round

103
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,420
And we want to take Ida into Eastbourne

104
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,100
But she's not halter trained at all

105
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,020
None of our cows are halter
trained at the moment

106
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,060
So we're going to have a go
at putting her on a halter

107
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,820
And now I am just making friends with her

108
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,100
And bribing her with a bit of food

109
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,660
Get your head out of it!

110
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,060
Come on!

111
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,380
God, you're strong

112
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,580
Get your head out of it. That's it.

113
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,860
Good girl!

114
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,140
That's a good girl

115
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,300
Alright

116
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,660
- Actually, can you open the gate, Paul?
- Yeah.

117
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,460
Come on girl. Come on then.

118
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,860
Let's get you used to walking

119
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,300
Shall I take the food?

120
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,500
Yeah, that's a good idea

121
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,460
Just hold it like a yard in front of her

122
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,780
That's it, give it a shake and she'll...

123
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,740
That's it

124
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,740
Keep walking her round

125
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,340
You are not bad, are you?

126
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,020
We can do what we like
with you, can't we, hey?

127
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,540
Aren't you being good?

128
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,420
She's not trying to get away or
she's not bothered about the halter

129
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,460
No

130
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,020
Alright, okay then Ida, we'll let you go

131
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,500
You can go up the field with your mates

132
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,900
You're quite a pretty old thing
really, aren't you?

133
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,740
Thank you!

134
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,260
Yeah you are as well, Paul

135
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,580
Come on then, come on then.

136
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,220
Come on then.

137
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:59,600
Come on Ida, you're getting
your photo taken from over there

138
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Hello Ida, hello.

139
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,220
Hello darling!

140
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,980
We could be all day here, couldn't we?

141
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,940
Actually there's going to be
more people as it goes along

142
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,380
You're beautiful, aren't you?

143
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,020
I hope they're going to give you a
special treat when you come home

144
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,740
We've got some feed here. Here you are.

145
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,020
You hold your hand out flat,
she'll take this off your hand.

146
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,940
Is this a new venture for you?

147
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,740
We've got a door step delivery in Hailsham
and we're going to start one in Eastbourne

148
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,740
It is going to be raw milk
we deliver. Unpasteurised.

149
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,340
So is this unhomogenised as well then?

150
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,180
Yeah, well this has only
been filled this morning

151
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,140
In a few hours the cream line
will be about down there

152
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,940
And you have that on your cereal

153
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,460
You've done really well, haven't you Ida?

154
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,740
There's a good girl

155
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,500
You've done really well, haven't you, hey?

156
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,700
We've never had a cow from
the Hailsham herd up here before

157
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,540
Smelling a bit of sea air

158
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:26,560
You are a good girl, aren't you?
You like Eastbourne, do you?

159
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,820
Come on then girl. We'll go home now

160
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,500
You really like it up here, don't you?

161
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:41,140
Come on then, we'll go back home.

162
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Come on, Ida!

163
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:04,400
It will be better to back
the trailer up to her!

164
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Yes, that's it. Well done Paul.

165
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,300
Come on, Ida!

166
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Come on, Ida!

167
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,820
I think Ida just wants to live here now

168
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:05,420
Like a lot of people she
wants to retire in Eastbourne

169
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,820
Back with your mates again

170
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,300
You'd think they hadn't seen
each other for a long time

171
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,700
Go on. Your mates again.

172
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:41,700
Got all her fans, come to say hello to her.

173
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,900
Yeah, that's given us maybe
some ideas, we'll use Ida more.

174
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,620
'cause you lot, I don't think you
lot are going to be as good as Ida.

175
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,980
As much as you'd love to get the sea air.

176
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,340
Have you come and say hello? Do you
want to go back to Eastbourne, do you?

177
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,260
Hey? Do you like that?

178
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,340
But you haven't been milked, you're
going to get milked this afternoon now.

179
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,060
Which should be alright, you haven't got a lot of
milk, have you? Coming to the end of your lactation.

180
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,660
We've got a heifer that calved in this field.
She calved a bit early and had a big calf.

181
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,700
And the calf was dead

182
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,100
And she's got paralysis in one of
her legs and hasn't been able to get up

183
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,300
I can't see her at the moment which
means she's probably laid right out

184
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,140
She's sort of on her side and
can't get up I imagine

185
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:26,180
It's a nice heifer, so we don't
want to loose her.

186
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,820
Hello girl

187
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,940
Are you struggling again?

188
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:39,260
You've moved quite a bit though

189
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,860
I'll give you a push up in a moment

190
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:06,920
You want to try and get up?

191
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,580
How did you get over here then?

192
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:24,220
Did you walk over here? Did you?

193
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,340
Up you get then, come on, up you get

194
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,420
You don't want to know, do you?

195
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Okay, I'll give you some grub

196
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:05,760
Are you thirsty?

197
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,180
How are you going to behave with me
now? Are you going to be alright with me?

198
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,940
That means "Get off!
I don't like that". Isn't it?

199
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:30,540
Now you've got your grub you can
shake your head at me, can't you?

200
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:38,560
There's a good girl.
It ain't too bad, is it?

201
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,060
You wouldn't have let me do that
with you earlier on, would you?

202
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,500
Let's hope you get better

203
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,420
You are a pretty little thing really

204
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,940
Within a group of animals you'll
always have a friendly one

205
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,620
And you'll always have one that
doesn't want to know you at all

206
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,900
But if a friendly one follows you

207
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:13,420
And two or three then follow that one and
then the rest follow then you've cracked it

208
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,300
It is harder than it was in the past

209
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:22,540
because the numbers of cattle per
stockman are a lot higher now

210
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:30,560
I think the average numbers per stockman
is something like 150 cows per stockman now

211
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:39,520
Whereas 20, 25 years ago that would
have been between 50 and 75 probably

212
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,900
Our ratios here are like what
they used to be

213
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,220
That's why we've still got that relationship,
but it gets harder once you get into big numbers

214
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,500
To know your cows individually and
to have that relationship with them.

215
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,740
Are you going to get up?

216
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,140
Do you want to give it a go?

217
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:07,100
What are you thinking about?

218
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,580
Don't you like me sitting here?

219
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,020
What's going on?

220
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,780
Are you going to give it a go?

221
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:27,800
I'm surprised you haven't drunk anything

222
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:42,720
Come on then, come on then.

223
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:50,700
We'll leave you, shall we?
Shall we leave you?

224
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:58,720
I've got cows to milk

225
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Come on, Kate.

226
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,260
Come on then.

227
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:36,280
That's it. Well done.

228
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,220
She's over there, she's walked about
100 yards from where she was earlier

229
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,340
Brilliant to see her up

230
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:19,060
The only trouble is she's walked 100 yards that way
and I want her to walk that way to join the herd

231
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,340
Which is going to take a bit of
doing, but anyway

232
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,500
She's over there, we've seen her and I'm really
thrilled that she is up again after a week of being down

233
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,100
Which way are you going to go?

234
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,580
Are you going around the trees then?

235
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,100
Or are you going to follow me?

236
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:47,120
Come on then. Come on then.

237
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:19,360
Good girl, that's it.

238
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,100
You know where you're going now, don't you?

239
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,140
You lot had thought you're
coming out, didn't you?

240
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Tough. You're not.

241
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:57,780
The only thing is, because she's a weak cow, some
know she's a weak cow and bully her a little bit

242
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,500
But they are more interested in coming out

243
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,540
She's alright

244
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,180
She's just going down into the field now

245
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,060
Which is good

246
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,820
Hi Dad, it's me

247
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,460
I still have to come and bottle

248
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,340
I'm just going to have a bit of tea first

249
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Okay, see you later, bye

250
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,300
Oh bugger

251
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,260
I'm not very domesticated

252
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,500
Is my saucepan alright?

253
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,620
Yeah, it's fine

254
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,180
Our saucepan, darling

255
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,660
You put the heat on and then
you don't put anything in it

256
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,740
How do you know?

257
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,860
I can hear it

258
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,340
You've got a very good hearing
when you want to haven't you, darling?

259
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,060
Pardon?

260
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,940
You have got a very good ...yeah...

261
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,500
Case in point

262
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,980
Is it a nice bath?

263
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,540
- Yes, thank you.
- Good.

264
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,660
Are you sure you don't want
a glass of wine?

265
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:06,680
- I have one.
- Have you?

266
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,740
Claire cooks everything really.
We don't have any ready made stuff

267
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,380
Use our own beef, which saves a fortune

268
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:32,400
The boys enjoy that

269
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,820
What have you got then?

270
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,500
What have you had?

271
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,500
You had that quickly, didn't you?

272
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:20,380
It's alright. A big calf.

273
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,820
That's quite a good size calf and
she did well to have it on her own

274
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,900
But it's a bull calf, a friesian bull calf

275
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:35,460
So that on most dairy farms that little fellow
would be shot at birth, taken away and shot

276
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,260
It doesn't see its first day

277
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,220
But we keep all the bull calves and
he'll grow to become a beef animal

278
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:51,240
So he'll have about two and
a half years on the farm

279
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:40,520
He was quite a big fellow, that went in.
He was about three years old, old Kato.

280
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:55,440
Something like that, I reckon

281
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,660
He was never very friendly,
not like some of the others

282
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,180
Some of the others you go up to and
pat, but he was always a little bit wary

283
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,660
I don't know why. He was castrated

284
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:24,580
That normally quietens them down

285
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,900
He had a bad infection in his foot
when he was about a year old

286
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,860
Which we trimmed and that cleared up

287
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:37,220
I don't know how he'd done it. He
cut the back of his hoof in some way

288
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,540
Otherwise he's been fine

289
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:48,560
Kato has had a pretty brilliant life
for a dairy bull calf born on the farm

290
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,780
Alright, Tinky

291
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,100
It's me, you daft dog.

292
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:22,460
What have you got then, girl?

293
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,780
Bull calf

294
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,660
You are a big old fellow, ain't you?

295
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,940
Can you get up already?

296
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:41,600
Shame it's not a heifer calf. We've
had lots of bull calves recently.

297
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,180
What do you think then, girl?

298
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:55,200
I can't think which one that is.
It must be your 6th or 7th

299
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,660
Oh my goodness!

300
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,700
Come on then, up you get.

301
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,740
A little friesian heifer calf.
Quite a good size.

302
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,740
They don't normally calve down here

303
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:46,100
Come on then. Follow your mum.
We better walk you up the farm.

304
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,420
That's a surprise?

305
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,300
Yes, it's a surprise. It's a bit early.

306
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,940
Its still got a very fleshy navel

307
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,180
Oh, don't clear off

308
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,620
You look out Tinky.
She won't like you being about.

309
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:11,900
That's it. Follow your mum.

310
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,900
We'll get through these rushes, in a minute

311
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:22,920
You'll see where you're going
a bit better then

312
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:32,020
Bess, you're right in the way.

313
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:40,040
It's your calf, girl.

314
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,900
Come on, you.

315
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:57,660
You're going the wrong way.

316
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,500
Come on, trouble maker. Go on.

317
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,740
Hello trouble.

318
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:13,760
How are you then trouble?

319
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,580
Get up, go on.

320
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,140
You would think she was the mum

321
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,700
Come on you, come on. Up you get.

322
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,460
Being all possessive.

323
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,420
You keep going, little fellow.

324
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,620
Come on, it's not your calf.

325
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,820
It's your calf, isn't it girl?

326
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:03,840
You won't have yours for another
two weeks yet. Or three weeks.

327
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,740
Come on, go and join your calf, go on.

328
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,460
Good girl, that's it.

329
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:27,180
I'll put you some fresh
straw in in a minute.

330
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,580
That's good.

331
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:36,600
Come on then.

332
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:50,080
Oh, you dozy... you dozy animals.

333
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,980
Are they going through the
brambles or coming back?

334
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,340
Well, stuck in between.

335
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:04,360
Poxy animals.

336
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:47,220
What a job that was.

337
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,580
Hopeless, wasn't it?

338
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,660
O dear, oh dear.

339
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:59,680
Fit as a butcher's dog.

340
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:26,360
[crows calling }

341
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:45,280
I wonder whether she's dislocated her hip

342
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,740
That's enough, Bess!

343
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,340
Hello, it's Steve Hook from
Longleys farm, Hailsham

344
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:13,420
Could I have a vet to look at a
cow this afternoon please?

345
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,820
She calved a few days ago,
quite a bad calving

346
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,540
And she had paralysis in her back right leg

347
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,980
She was walking two days ago, in the field

348
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,820
But now she won't get up at all

349
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Her leg just doesn't look quite right

350
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,900
Half two?

351
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:02,700
Great, okay. Yeah, that's great.
Thanks very much. Okay, bye.

352
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:09,260
Potentially she has eight years
of milking ahead of her

353
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,980
It's right at the start of her production
life that we're going to lose her

354
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,060
If the leg's no good

355
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:24,080
But if she can't walk to the milking parlour
and get milked, then she'll have to go

356
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,540
Right. Let's get you some water.

357
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:38,560
Hello trouble

358
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,780
We've lifted her up

359
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,660
I think she's got a dislocated hip

360
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,940
She's got a dislocated hip?

361
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,220
If you go on here... listen

362
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,700
You can hear it clunking

363
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:12,220
Well, basically she's got no chance really

364
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,740
The annoying thing is, there's
probably actually nothing wrong with her

365
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,060
She's great

366
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,980
And she's a second calver as well

367
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,380
Just sort of really getting to
a good part of her life

368
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,460
Oh well.

369
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,700
It's a bit of a bugger, isn't it really.

370
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,540
But at least we know now.

371
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,100
Oh well

372
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:39,900
You just feel a bit robbed really

373
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:45,660
It's not a nice way for a cow to
finish its time on the farm

374
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,900
But you have to do it

375
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,460
If the cow is in pain and
can't get up, can't walk

376
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,100
And there is nothing that
can be done for it

377
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,900
You have to have her put down

378
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,460
And that's the end of it

379
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:14,780
It's not very nice like... you know,
when Ida goes, that'll be a very sad day

380
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,940
Because she is...
there is a difference between

381
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,500
Having a great relationship with the cows

382
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,780
Being able to stroke them, and go up to
them and they're alright with you and so on

383
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,900
That's one thing, but then

384
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,580
A little bit further on from that, they
almost become a pet, which is where Ida is

385
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,660
And that is where it becomes harder

386
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:44,680
Just that little bit of a closer
link or relationship

387
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:51,580
But then Ida, she might end up staying
here as an old girl and see her days here

388
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,820
I wouldn't be surprised

389
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,100
Hello girls. Milking time.

390
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,500
I don't know where Ida's got to

391
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,740
Probably at the back there somewhere

392
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,140
Yeah, she's at the back

393
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,900
Come on, Ida.

394
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,260
Come on girl.

395
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,340
What are you doing then?

396
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,420
Are you going to come and say hello?

397
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,540
You remember Andy, don't you, hey?

398
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,780
You remember the cameraman?

399
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,820
That brings back memories
of Eastbourne, I expect?

400
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,300
Doesn't it?

401
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,700
You're daft old thing, ain't you?

402
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,780
Go on then, in you go.

403
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,620
You're not going to Eastbourne today.

404
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:21,100
Hello you lot, you must be pretty thirsty.

405
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,540
Water. You need some water, don't you?

406
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,220
I went to a farmers' meeting
not so long ago

407
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,860
Only a month ago

408
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,460
And a chap, he farms in Oxfordshire

409
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,580
He reckoned that TB was
spreading down the Thames

410
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,660
About 10 miles a year

411
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,260
He's never had TB in all his
60 years he'd been farming

412
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,420
And they just got it

413
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,900
The day I saw him he had
50 cattle being killed for TB

414
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:18,920
And he was, you know, really upset about it

415
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,260
Why on earth can't TB be eradicated?

416
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,180
If TB was eradicated then the
badger population would be healthy

417
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,500
And the cattle population would be healthy

418
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:36,220
Why isn't it eradicated?

419
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:42,500
It's not eradicated, because... there's
an uneven policy in terms of eradicating it

420
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:47,740
In that cattle that have got TB
are being killed

421
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,140
Badgers that have got TB
aren't being killed

422
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,020
That's where the imbalance lies

423
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,020
Come on.

424
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:07,040
Push up.

425
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:21,740
That's it.

426
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,940
Hopefully we won't have any
conclusives or any reactors

427
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,700
And then we can say, be on the next invoice

428
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:02,180
We've just had a TB test

429
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,140
TB is the one really,
because the way that's...

430
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,180
That's going to be in the news

431
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,380
- Oh, she's a bump, is she?
- She has, yeah.

432
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,060
No, that's fine. She's got two lumps
but the avian one is much bigger

433
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,140
So that's fine

434
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,100
Alright, so that's alright then

435
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:29,120
It does worry me when I see you
stopping and writing things down

436
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,300
Come on then

437
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:53,400
Come on then

438
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,860
Come on then

439
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,020
There's always one

440
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:12,040
Come on then

441
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,420
Come on then

442
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,700
That's it!

443
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,580
That wasn't too bad

444
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,500
We've just passed out TB test

445
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,940
Animals are TB free

446
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:39,960
Which means we've got another
year of selling organic milk as raw milk

447
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,620
Alright girl

448
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,020
You're not coming out

449
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,820
What number of calf will
this be for her, Steve?

450
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,180
I don't know, number eight?

451
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,220
Something like that.

452
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:22,780
If Ida does't get on with it soon

453
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,060
I'll put some ropes on its feet
and start to pull

454
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:34,080
And then she'll start to push... anyway

455
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:54,920
Alright girl, alright

456
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,740
Good girl, that's it. You start pushing.

457
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,180
Alright, there's the nose

458
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,980
It's alive

459
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,780
Popping its tongue out

460
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,180
Come on, Ida

461
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:24,020
Have you got another little Ida, have you?

462
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:34,340
Come on, Ida. Keep pushing, girl.

463
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,380
What I've seen of its face so far,
it looks like its mum

464
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,300
Got that white sort of blaze
down the middle of its face

465
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:48,260
Come on, girl, push, push, push

466
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,900
Push, girl, come on, push

467
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:57,620
Once you get the head out, it isn't too bad

468
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,540
Come on, girl, push. Come on,
let's have the head out.

469
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:09,560
Nearly out, isn't it?

470
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:32,560
Come on, nearly there

471
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:44,280
Nearly

472
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,980
My feet keep slipping

473
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,060
Nearly out!

474
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:07,080
Come on push girl. I'll pull and you push.

475
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,460
I can't pull you there.

476
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:24,480
Too close to the wall.

477
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,940
If I can't get it out,
I'll have to get a jack on it

478
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,700
And you sort of ratchet it out then.

479
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,580
Just the head. As soon as the
head comes out, she'll be away

480
00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:00,300
Come on, Ida, keep pushing girl.

481
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,140
Yeah, go on

482
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:09,980
Come on girl, one more big push

483
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,460
Here we are, look!

484
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,980
Well, it's got Ida's face.

485
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,220
Come on girl.

486
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,420
Keep pushing.

487
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,060
Come on, we need to get
the shoulders out now

488
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:34,080
Come on, Ida, push!

489
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,540
A bit more, come on.

490
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:49,520
Can't have you stuck on the hip

491
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,140
Bull calf, isn't it?

492
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,420
Yeah, a bull calf.

493
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,660
Here you are girl,
look what you've got then.

494
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:06,460
You're a good mum, ain't you?
Straight in there.

495
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:12,140
A bit disappointing its a bull calf.
Well very disappointing.

496
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:19,540
It'd be nicer if it was another little Ida

497
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,300
So he'll end up being a
beef animal, this one.

498
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,700
Sad really.

499
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:29,860
Most dairy bull calves get
shot at a day old.

500
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:37,880
He's got the genetics of producing
milk but he's a male, so hasn't got a home.

501
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:50,740
You must be worn out Ida. All that licking.

502
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:58,760
Right.

503
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,980
Another cow calving up there. Oh my word.

504
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,740
We've got another cow calving.

505
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:24,740
But the heifer, she's holding
her tail up, which is a sign.

506
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:32,760
It's gone a bid mad suddenly.

507
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:42,920
Come on girl, keep pushing.

508
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:53,220
Do you want to see what
you've got then, girl?

509
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,500
What have you got?

510
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,060
Heifer.

511
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,340
Hello darling.

512
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,820
Yeah, carry on without me

513
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,300
I've just calved two cows and I
have a heifer about to calf as well

514
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,940
It's all gone a bit manic

515
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:16,960
Yeah okay, bye.

516
01:02:54,280 --> 01:03:00,420
Been waiting for me, are you?

517
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,780
Mind yourself

518
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,300
That's it. Round you go.

519
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,540
Round you go.

520
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,380
Go on then.

521
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:25,560
That's it. Round you go.

522
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,780
Come on then. Come on, Myrtle.

523
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,340
Come on, Kate

524
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:19,700
Come on, Ruby.

525
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:27,720
And you're another Kate.
Come on, up you get.

526
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,940
You know, you work hard,
keeping a herd of cows

527
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,700
And the milk goes away in a milk lorry

528
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:16,300
And you get paid 27 pence
today for our milk

529
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,460
27 pence per litre

530
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,900
And it's costing us 34p a litre

531
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,060
It's just money literally down the drain

532
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,940
And it just makes you mad really

533
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:34,420
Why on earth can't we be paid a sustainable
price for the milk that we produce

534
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:40,980
Instead of being ripped off
and forced to struggle

535
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,180
Running at a loss and living of benefit?

536
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,100
What's the point of going down that route?

537
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,580
The tax payer is paying for it really

538
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,020
The tax payer is paying for cheap milk

539
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,140
We're getting paid below cost of production

540
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,860
The supermarket earns loads
of money, profits out of us

541
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,740
We can't even pay ourselves
a wage out of the farm

542
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,940
So we claim working families
tax credit to live

543
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,980
It's just bizarre really

544
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,260
Why on earth can't we farm

545
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:11,340
Work our 60 or 70 hours a week farming

546
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:15,620
Produce a product which is a high
quality product that the supermarket buys

547
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,620
But why don't they pay us a price

548
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:23,140
That allows us the dignity to
pay for our own way of living

549
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,980
I don't know, that's what makes me angry

550
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,180
It really does

551
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:34,820
The family farm is dying very
quickly in this country

552
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,380
And as a result there's a whole generation

553
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,420
That's not coming through
onto farms to work

554
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,380
And all those skills are being lost

555
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:48,820
All those stockman skills,
husbandry skills just aren't around

556
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:55,180
People just aren't going into it any more,
because there isn't... what's the point?

557
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,500
You know, y ou work hard for nothing

558
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:01,460
So, why do it?

559
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,100
I get asked that several times

560
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,980
And the only reason we do it is
because we have found a way out

561
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,580
By retailing direct

562
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,980
And it's given us a chance.

563
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:18,000
It's given us the chance to stay here

564
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:52,100
Right, here goes

565
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,140
So that's that

566
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,900
And then they fill up again.
You put the next six in.

567
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:05,920
Well yeah, you do this

568
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:13,700
It's filled them up to the right level

569
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,940
Those ones are pretty good

570
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,460
Well if we...

571
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:23,220
Let these five go through

572
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:31,240
And that one will catch up next time

573
01:09:52,920 --> 01:10:00,920
They're all filling quite well now

574
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,860
We're bottling in the new bottling plant

575
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:21,580
We've done 200 in 25 minutes

576
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:29,600
Yeah, okay bye.

577
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,860
Willy Wonka bottle, that one.

578
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:39,140
It's a Willy Wonka bottle, it
hasn't got any markings on it

579
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:47,160
Anybody who gets to see the Willy Wonka
bottle can come and see the Hook milk factory

580
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,620
Come in - Hello

581
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:52,860
See what you think

582
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,700
Oh my goodness!

583
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,340
- Haven't you seen it before?
- No!

584
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,180
- It's all sensitised?
- Yeah, and they all fill to the right level.

585
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,540
Oh my word!

586
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,340
This is amazing!

587
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,580
Well, we started half an hour ago

588
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,940
And you've done 200 in...?

589
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,020
We've done nearly 300, haven't we?

590
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,700
300 in half an hour?

591
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,340
Yeah, you can all have a go

592
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:17,100
Hold on, hold on... oh yeah,
you can press it now, go on

593
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:22,380
That's it.

594
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,860
What's the red button do, dad?

595
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:30,420
- What does that button do?
- Uhum, yeah...

596
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:33,260
Alright, press the green one again!

597
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,420
That's it!

598
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,300
Where' the milk coming from?

599
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,380
It's pumping it in all the time.

600
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,980
Press the red one

601
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,460
- Hey?
- Where's it from?

602
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,580
- It's pumping straight from the milk tank.
- Cool!

603
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,260
Alright, okay, push that forward Giles!

604
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:53,820
Push it right forward, more,
more, as far as you can reach

605
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,100
You got it, now pull it back

606
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:59,900
Now press the two green ones!

607
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,780
Yeah, result!

608
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,260
You can do this job!

609
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:11,140
That's it! Six more bottles, boys.

610
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:19,160
Press the two green ones again,
well done, that's it Giles!

611
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:24,260
I'm pretty pleased with it really.
It's going to change things quite a lot.

612
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:32,280
And it does seem a bit more
professional suddenly.

613
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,580
Ow!

614
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,220
That was my head, that was.

615
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:55,240
- It's not the right height, is it mate?
- No.

616
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,940
Right then!

617
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:10,540
You're not coming out today,
you lot aren't. Only this lot.

618
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,140
You're the lucky ones, aren't you?

619
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:18,140
That's got you all stirred up

620
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,100
Look at this one

621
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,660
She's biting my elbow

622
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,940
Saying "come on!", weren't you?

623
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,420
You're going to keep biting my
elbow telling me to get on with it?

624
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:33,340
She is literally having a go
at my elbow then

625
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:38,940
Reminding me that I was... Come on then,
come on then! You're coming out now then?

626
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,300
I know, I know.

627
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,860
Alright, let's open some gates!

628
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,100
We're just going to let you
into the yard for a start

629
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:49,740
You're not going into the
field straight away

630
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:57,220
Alright then girls.
Are you ready to go out then?

631
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:59,860
Ready for playtime?

632
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,220
Aren't I rotten, hey?

633
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,780
In all winter, haven't you? Now
you want to go out, don't you?

634
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,020
And you are wondering why
I'm not letting you out

635
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,060
Are you going to come out then?
Are you ready Myrtle, to come out?

636
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,300
Come on then!

637
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:23,320
Come on then! Take your time!

638
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,980
Look at Nelly!

639
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,820
They picked up some dust
coming through here, didn't they?

640
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:50,500
Come on then girls, come on then!

641
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:54,100
Come on Ida, that's it, c ome on girl

642
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:58,260
You're missing the fun

643
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,660
Come on then, this way

644
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:17,840
Here we are.

645
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:28,560
Come on then, come on then

646
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,380
Hello girl

647
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,940
Hello Ida

648
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,340
Alright, let's put a halter on you first

649
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:19,020
Hello girl

650
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:24,300
That's it. You've had this done to
you a few times, haven't you, hey?

651
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:32,300
- Do you want her standing up?
- No, fine.

652
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:40,320
That's it, okay. Good girl, Ida!

653
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:53,800
Do you want to stay down here today then?

654
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:14,440
I don't really remember you being ill

655
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:20,580
- Have you seen her passing any dung?
- Yes, it's been very liquid.

656
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:28,600
- Her breathing is a bit... there's a bit of effort there.
- Yeah?

657
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,460
Nosey lot over there.

658
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:38,580
They wondering what's happened to you.

659
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,940
There's quite a lot of
noise coming through.

660
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:46,140
I'm not sure if it's definitely her
heart, but if it is then it's really fast.

661
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,340
Right.

662
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:54,220
A bit strange.

663
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,380
So she's not giving us many
clues at the moment.

664
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,740
No. She is definitely in pain

665
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:01,300
And I'm a bit worried about that odd noise.

666
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,420
Possibly a wire.

667
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:08,940
A wire? - Yes, as in she's eaten a wire.

668
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,420
If she has eaten a bit of wire
or something like that

669
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:20,440
- there's not much you can do about it, is there?
- No.

670
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,700
A little bit dirty, but not very.

671
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:28,260
Could she've eaten a bit of plastic or
something like that? Would that do it?

672
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:32,100
It's normally a wire,
because it perforates through

673
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:35,500
Especially if I can hear
strange heart sounds

674
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,340
It might be that it worked its
way from the rumen into the heart

675
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,780
Into the region of the heart

676
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:48,580
Blimey!

677
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:49,860
Come on, Ida!

678
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:57,880
Oh, you're on my foot!

679
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:06,300
Steve reassures Ida

680
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,860
Good girl

681
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:13,980
Are you in?

682
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,500
Is it anything to do with her age,
do you think? Because she's 12.

683
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,260
- It could be heart failure. Possibly.
- Yeah?

684
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:23,140
But it doesn't explain the pain

685
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:29,780
Normally a pain like that, combined
with heart noises, is generally a wire.

686
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:34,420
But all you can do really is try
and feed her up.

687
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,460
Try the anti-inflammatory and
see if that gets her eating a bit more.

688
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:39,180
Yeah, yeah.

689
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:43,220
We'll check on her in a couple
of days and see how she's doing.

690
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,860
Okay.

691
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:49,820
- Fingers crossed.
- Yeah.

692
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:57,840
Thanks, Nicky.

693
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,860
Hello, Ida!

694
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:46,980
How are you this morning then, hey?

695
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,340
These flies are a pain, aren't they?

696
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:58,360
I'm going to give you a drink of this stuff

697
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,580
Good girl.

698
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,700
Keep swallowing.

699
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:14,720
Try and get your rumen going a bit.

700
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,580
You're not happy, are you, hey?

701
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:28,600
You're not happy.

702
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:43,800
You're just not happy, are you?

703
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:53,500
You're not even chewing your cud.

704
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,300
Hello Mike. Just a quick one

705
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:43,320
Have you got a metal detector?

706
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,980
Come on then. Out you come.

707
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,460
- She's stayed in the shade, hasn't she?
- Yeah

708
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:55,620
That's intelligent

709
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:58,980
The rumen really is...

710
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,100
Yeah, in there.

711
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:12,820
- That's a lot, isn't it?
- Yeah.

712
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,740
It starts up here somewhere.

713
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,420
Yeah, but it does come right
up in here, the rumen.

714
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,620
Yeah, so it goes in there.

715
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:24,300
No, it's right up in her neck!

716
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,140
It's even up here!

717
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:30,900
I wonder if it's something
in her throat then?

718
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:34,460
It's right up here.

719
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,540
It starts there.

720
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,620
Maybe that's why she's not eating?
If there is a bit of wire in her gullet.

721
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:57,660
Well Ida?

722
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:00,420
Try not to stand on my foot!

723
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:08,440
I'm going to phone the vet, I think.

724
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:23,120
You need to nose her

725
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:40,220
- Gosh, she's been eating a lot of mud.
- A lot of mud?

726
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,420
She must have!

727
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:50,440
Mouth's full of mud!

728
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,580
No. I got down to there

729
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,740
Which I'm actually quite surprised I did

730
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:11,860
- Nothing.
- Nothing? Okay.

731
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:16,340
I mean she still looks quite good

732
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:24,360
Just that she is so hollow

733
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:54,880
I wonder where she's hiding today?

734
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:08,600
Oh, she's over there, I think.

735
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:18,260
I've got something a bit
different for you today, girl.

736
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:23,820
I got you some yogurty milk

737
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,340
I'll give you your jabs first

738
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:30,100
I know you won't like it

739
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:38,120
Sorry about this, girl.

740
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,740
Good girl

741
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:52,760
I'll give you a dose now

742
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,700
See what you think of that girl.
Do you want a drink?

743
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:05,860
Or shall we tube you?

744
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,820
Here we are.

745
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:11,860
Don't you fancy that?

746
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:14,020
You don't really, do you?

747
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:22,040
Let's see. What's that then?

748
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:38,120
You're making a few more grunts
and groany noises today, aren't you?

749
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,100
Have a drink?

750
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:51,120
Do you want to have a drink?

751
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,340
Have a little taste!

752
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:01,860
You're not happy, are you, hey?

753
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:09,880
You're not happy today, are you?

754
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:26,160
Not want a drink of water?

755
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:36,560
Water! Do you want some?

756
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,140
I didn't bring you any cake down, did I?

757
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:11,260
You might have eaten a bit of cake.

758
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:19,280
I didn't think about that.

759
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:31,020
You just don't fancy it, do you?

760
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:34,020
I have to leave you I'm afraid.

761
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:37,220
I've got to be somewhere else really.

762
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:40,100
See you later, alright?

763
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:04,400
Hello, I've got a dead cow which
I'd like to be collected, please.

764
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:24,600
In a way it's nice that she died down on
the marsh, with all the other cows around her

765
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:29,260
She didn't die alone down there

766
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,540
She had all the milking herd
around her last night

767
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:38,900
All her mates

768
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:44,500
Today she's going to be picked
up and be taken off the farm

769
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:48,820
So it's the end of an era really

770
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:58,980
Yes she was a symbol of what we do really

771
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:06,140
She epitomised what we try to do

772
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:11,180
Not a great producing cow,
lived a long happy life

773
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:15,740
And had a great relationship
with us all on the farm

774
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:23,760
She was just a lovely cow

775
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:31,940
But all the cows, when they go,
it's the end of one of the characters

776
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:34,740
Because they're all characters

777
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:39,420
And when they go you lose that character

778
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:42,260
But then as time passes you
have happy memories

779
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:49,620
Like her mum, her mum was fantastic
and it was very sad, when her mum went

780
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:53,220
But then later on, you just have
happy memories of the cow

781
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:58,780
And then you just think: yeah, Ida, she was
a great cow, she was one of our lovely cows

782
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,980
And then characters who aren't
even born yet come to the fore

783
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,540
And it all happens again

784
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:14,560
So like everything on the farm,
it's a cycle

785
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:20,820
You've got to appreciate the bad
moments to enjoy the good and vice versa

786
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:28,840
It's not an even thing all the time

787
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:36,900
Yeah, but she, she had a good life

788
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:44,020
She's the only cow that's been
to Eastbourne, for example

789
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:47,980
But yeah, life moves on. It'll be
another Ida or another Kitty

790
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,860
Or one of the others, that takes the mantle

791
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:57,740
Becomes the new queen of the herd

792
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:02,020
We'll wait and see who the lucky lady is.

793
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:53,980
Morning girls! Are you all here, are you?

794
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,700
Are you all up here?

795
01:35:55,720 --> 01:36:01,460
Let you in the milking parlour, I think.

796
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:08,300
Looks like you are all up here! Blimey!

797
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:12,320
Mind yourselves!
