1
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,438
You there up on the tree.

2
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,036
This is your last chance
to get down,

3
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,430
or we'll be forced
to take measures!

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,076
Come on!

5
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,074
Nitzan, you listening?

6
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,040
I'm asking you for the last time...

7
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,836
Get down, before it's too late.

8
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,239
Nitzan, please, give up!

9
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,509
Get down off the tree now!

10
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,433
Gal Toren

UP THE WRONG TREE

17
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,799
Hey buddy! Come here.

18
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,839
Come here for a sec.

19
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,278
You wanna sign, man?

20
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,634
Say, you happen to see a cute girl
walking a big black dog?

21
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,434
No.
-Can I have one?

22
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,790
Don't you wanna know what you
wouldn't sign?

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,231
What wouldn't I sign?
-Nice of you to ask.

24
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,514
A petition to turn this lot
into a park.

25
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,792
What's wrong
with the way it is now?

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,674
Nothing,
but if we don't move fast,

27
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,269
this whole place
becomes a parking lot.

28
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,233
You don't say?

29
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,875
Motherfuckers, huh?
-They sure are.

30
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,878
An outrage!

31
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,037
Ever heard of Tzemakh?
-Not really.

32
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,073
He was in city council,
and for the green party...

33
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,476
Man, I don't care about no politics.

34
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,557
This ain't politics,
don't be a cynic.

35
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,235
Just sign here

36
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,233
and get it over with.

37
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,674
With all the shit in the world,
this is what bothers you?

38
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,838
Seriously? This lot?

39
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,229
You know what,

40
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,079
don't sign, okay?
Thank you.

41
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,669
You upset now?
-I ain't upset.

42
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,239
Hey, buddy, you wanna sign?

43
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,432
I already signed, thanks.
-No, thank you.

44
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,830
I don't want to butt in, but I think
someone else is walking your dog.

45
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,475
Zorba?

46
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,800
Big, black, ears like this, right?

47
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,796
Do us a favor,

48
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,752
can I leave this suitcase
with you for a bit?

49
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,277
You've got some nerve, huh?

50
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,589
Municipal Inspection,
license please.

51
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,870
Hey, Nitz.

52
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,473
I missed your lousy humor.
-What's up?

53
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,149
Want do you want in your pita?
-Sabikh.

54
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,914
With hummus?

55
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,154
You know what, make it
shakshuka instead.

56
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,640
On second thought,
shove them both in there.

57
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,999
Nitz, trust me, you don't want
that kind of mess.

58
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,113
I can't make up my mind
you know how I've missed them both.

59
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,470
You're the boss.
-Thanks.

60
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,518
So tell me, how was Australia?

61
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,510
It sucked.

62
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,630
Really?

63
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,155
Na. Just not much to tell.
You guys do alright here without me?

64
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,033
Thank God.

65
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,674
What's with the...?

66
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,552
Getting closer to God.

67
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,394
How is it?

68
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,439
Man, this "Mess"
is fucking delicious.

69
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,120
You've gotta taste it.
-I trust you.

70
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,111
You still saving
leftovers for Zorba?

71
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,951
Sure am.
<i>-l'll</i> take them over now.

72
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,874
They're glad you're back,
Zorba and...?

73
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,234
Kessem. -Yeah, Kessem.
Were they happy to see you?

74
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,393
They don't know I'm here.
-How's that?

75
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,160
A surprise.

76
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,469
Hello.
-Hi

77
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,829
Hold on!

78
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,830
One second.

79
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,796
Hey, come in.

80
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,840
Sorry for the mess.

81
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,395
You can set that down here.

82
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,519
You know what, put it here.

83
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,836
No, put it there, that's perfect.

84
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,238
How much should I give?

85
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,832
Don't know, never had a dog.

86
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,558
No, I meant the tip.
-It's on me.

87
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,598
Why? No way.

88
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,713
Wait, <i>l'll</i> find my purse.

89
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,559
What's his name?

90
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,559
I found him this morning,
haven't even named him yet.

91
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,477
Come here,
you've got to hear this.

92
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,279
<i>You're assuming
that I'm afraid of you...</i>

93
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,358
It must be love, huh?

94
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,712
<i>I can see it now...
- You have an issue with money.</i>

95
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,593
Reminds me of my parents.

96
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,232
They've been like that forever.

97
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,760
<i>You'd hang me if you could.</i>

98
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,236
<i>You always end up with the same...</i>

99
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,876
Pooch, what is it? What?

100
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,829
Cutie...

101
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,032
Cutie, what is it?

102
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,240
Alright, Zorba,
I left something for you.

103
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,230
You tell Kessem I was here.

104
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,916
You know what,
don't say a word.

105
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,352
That's it, had enough?

106
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,474
Gimme a light.
-I quit smoking.

107
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,279
How come?

108
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,318
We're not kids anymore.

109
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,993
Maybe you're not.

110
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,398
What are you reading there?

111
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,234
You got a light?

112
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,953
Tell me
-Yeah?

113
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,109
You still hanging out
with that stewardess?

114
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,469
That's so last year.

115
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,793
Any new chick lately?

116
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,273
Nothing specific.

117
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,837
And Kessem?
-What about her?

118
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,876
She got somebody?

119
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,472
Let it go, man.

120
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,433
Come on, let's play!

121
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,512
I heard there's some asshole
walking Zorba every morning.

122
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,358
What do you care anyways?

123
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,398
Letting some stranger walk my dog
seems right to you?

124
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,511
I walk him, you retard.

125
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,714
I know.

126
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,118
I saw your name on that
park petition thing.

127
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,070
Is this an interrogation now?

128
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,274
I'm just curious, why does it
have to be you walking Zorba?

129
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,960
'Cause he's too old and
heavy for Kessem to carry,

130
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,154
so I take him down on my way
to my "stupid job". Let's play!

131
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,919
What now?

132
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,555
Why didn't you tell me before?
-We agreed not to talk about her.

133
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,394
I've got to see Zorba.
-No you don't.

134
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,638
What have you got
against me, huh?

135
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,519
Cut it out.

136
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,832
What's your problem?

137
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,758
Remember what you said
before you left?

138
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,839
That she's out of your system, right?

139
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,599
So I said so.
-Great.

140
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,799
I haven't seen you for a year

141
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,709
and instead of playing some ball
you're talking my ear off.

142
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,075
Then let's go grab a beer.
-Forget it.

143
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,349
Gimme the key.
-What key?

144
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,710
You take Zorba out,
you've got the key, right?

145
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,115
I want to see my dog.

146
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,674
That's not cool, bro.

147
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,238
Why?! Are you judging me?
You're supposed to be my friend.

148
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,439
She doesn't need to know about it.

149
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,389
Do me a favor. I just want to see
the dog, honest, I miss him.

150
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,595
Why don't you do us
a favor and go fetch?

151
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,797
Why are you looking
at me like that?

152
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,318
I'm sorry, alright?
<i>I'll</i> never leave you again.

153
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,079
You know, sometimes...

154
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,073
parents don't get along.

155
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,591
It doesn't mean
I'm not crazy about you.

156
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,637
You know how much I missed you?

157
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,834
Hello, mind if I ask you
a few questions?

158
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,760
We're not interested, thanks.

159
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,032
Are you were aware of the struggle
regarding this lot

160
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,271
and what's your take?

161
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,270
Fuck your struggle, alright?

162
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,156
Okay. Is it because you think it's
hopeless, or you think it's dumb?

163
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,790
So you're like
a video-activist, huh?

164
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,753
Sort of. And who are you?
You don't live here,

165
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,917
so what are you
doing here anyways?

166
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,235
Not much.

167
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,872
Interesting, and your name is?
-Nitz.

168
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,436
Nitz, do you mind
taking over for me here?

169
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,070
Excuse me?

170
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,069
I just gotta upload this to my blog,
and you're here anyways.

171
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,911
You think I'm going to waste my time
watching over your stupid struggle?

172
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,120
Why not? It's a worthy cause,

173
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,955
and it might just be worth
your while. -Really...

174
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,595
Give me a break, you don't need
to do anything but sit here...

175
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,829
Hold this for a second... You don't
even have to get anybody to sign.

176
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,156
You can put the shirt on
if you want to.

177
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,354
And if you see something suspicious,
our phone number's over there.

178
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,792
I don't have a cellphone.

179
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,759
Oh... What's the worst
that could happen, right?

180
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,636
Yeah, this whole thing's
kind of useless, isn't it?

181
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,677
Ok, bye Nitz.

182
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,235
<i>I'll</i> get the blog up
and I'm back. Thanks!

183
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,274
You're the best!

184
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,557
There's snacks in the action tent.

185
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,357
<i>The city promised we'd have a
park here by the end of the year.</i>

186
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,598
<i>Meanwhile, looks like we've got
tough times ahead.</i>

187
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,076
<i>But Lahav, what's with the tent?</i>

188
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,433
You see the booth that scumbag
Tzemakh put up last night?

189
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,439
It's a sneaky attempt
to overtake the lot.

190
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,520
That's why we've gotta keep
this place occupied 24/7.

191
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,074
That's why my daughter and I
made this tent.

192
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,317
<i>But who's going to occupy the tent?</i>

193
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,399
Folks from the action committee,
people like me, like you.

194
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,313
People who care.

195
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,829
Fuck your struggle, alright?

196
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,476
<i>Nevertheless,
our park shall arise.</i>

197
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,994
<i>She said, why don 't you take a break?</i>

198
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,431
<i>Why do you involve her in our
sex life? - What% the problem?</i>

199
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,759
<i>If I wanted to involve her
in our sexual life I would...</i>

200
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,758
<i>I can't talk any sense into you.</i>

201
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,040
Good dog. Shhhh...

202
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,997
<i>I'd like to go back to my house.</i>

203
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,475
<i>You hear me,
do you mind getting out?</i>

204
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,239
Where are you, on the roof?

205
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,511
<i>If you come up here,
I 'm calling the cops.</i>

206
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,519
Have you lost it? What am I,
a rapist or something?

207
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,472
<i>I don 't want to see you, alright?</i>

208
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,198
Who told you I was here? Eran?

209
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,629
<i>No, Zorba.</i>

210
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,636
Very funny.

211
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,114
<i>Get the hell out of my house.</i>

212
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,156
Kessem.

213
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,156
<i>Don't 'Kessem' me.</i>

214
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,791
<i>I 'rn supposed to fall into your arms
just 'cause you're back?</i>

215
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,789
<i>You're not wanted here.
Get lost.</i>

216
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,755
It's my right to see Zorba,
he's my dog too, remember?

217
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,234
<i>That didn't keep you
from going away.</i>

218
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,396
But I came back.

219
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,319
<i>Well, good for you.</i>

220
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,199
<i>What do you want here anyways?</i>

221
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,596
I want to see my dog,
what's your problem?

222
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,952
<i>Like it% going to help now.</i>

223
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,919
What's wrong with him?

224
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,633
<i>He can barely walk.</i>

225
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,310
<i>ltk his lower spine.</i>

226
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,429
<i>The doctor says he hasn't got
much time left.</i>

227
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,278
<i>And it% only going to get worse.</i>

228
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,313
Then let me see him
while he's still around.

229
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,440
<i>As long as you're not here
when I 'm home.</i>

230
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,392
<i>Fine.
- Finek not good enough.</i>

231
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,234
<i>I leave evely morning at nine,
and get back at six thirty.</i>

232
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,034
What's with this new job?
You a yuppie now?

233
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,389
<i>Hilarious.</i>

234
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,470
<i>Remember, it% his back leg
on the left that hurts the most...</i>

235
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,516
<i>And that% it.
I'll deal with his food.</i>

236
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,438
How about "hi",

237
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,114
"welcome back",
anything like that?

238
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,960
<i>Justpromise me, starting tomorrow
I won 't find you here</i>

239
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,800
<i>otherwise I'll change the locks
and you'll never see him again.</i>

240
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,956
<i>You promise?</i>

241
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,436
I swear on my mother, alright?

242
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,077
<i>Bye.</i>

243
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,030
Fuck.

244
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,918
Mommy doesn't want me
to stay here tonight.

245
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,794
So <i>I'll</i> see you tomorrow. OK?

246
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,679
Bye, Zorbie.

247
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,878
Good evening.

248
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,869
Good evening.

249
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,715
You can go if you wanna,
I'm sticking around either way.

250
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:49,110
If those parking lot shitheads
try anything <i>I'll</i> let you know.

251
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,034
What's so funny?

252
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,710
I'm with the parking lot shitheads.
-Whadya mean?

253
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,319
Guarding.

254
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,758
Guarding the booth?
Making sure it doesn't run off?

255
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,076
No. Guarding against vandals.

256
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,590
Who's going to vandalize?

257
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,952
People like you,
so-called park activists.

258
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,674
You want any coffee?

259
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,278
Be honest with me,

260
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,710
isn't it a waste? Huh?

261
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,192
Turning this into a parking lot?

262
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,118
Isn't a park way better?

263
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,239
Better for who? Me?
-For example.

264
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,675
And if there's a park here,

265
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,713
I'd be drinking coffee,
or sleeping here at night?

266
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,751
Why not?

267
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,474
'Cause they'll have special
park rangers against that.

268
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,071
And if there's a parking lot here,
they'll let you spend the night?

269
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,993
That's what they promised me,

270
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,989
a job during the day, and the
booth to lay my head at night.

271
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,350
That's one heck of a deal, huh?

272
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,631
I wouldn't trust those assholes.

273
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,592
Tzemakh is my brother-in-law.

274
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,469
So you're in tight, aren't you?

275
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,232
Then you tell your
brother-in-law, okay?

276
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,229
That Nitz said, there ain't gonna
be no parking lot here, okay?

277
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,273
Whatever you say.
Here, you want some?

278
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,598
What is that?
-Ritalin, it'll keep you awake.

279
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,354
Don't worry man, you can go to sleep.
I got no plans for tonight.

280
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,958
Me neither.

281
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,994
Good night.
-Good night.

282
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,512
<i>So who are these people who've
decided to invest their time</i>

283
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,473
<i>in this esoteric ideological
struggle? And why?</i>

284
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,469
<i>Today's blog is dedicated
to this question.</i>

285
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,670
<i>I don 't like the...</i>

286
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,391
Turn off the porn,
you've got a client waiting.

287
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,278
What can I get you? Sabikh?
-A "Mess".

288
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,479
And cigarettes, a lighter,

289
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,239
and a beer.

290
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,431
Put it on the park committee's tab.

291
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,514
What, you too?
-Why are you surprised?

292
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,757
You just don't seem the type.

293
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,354
You don't seem
the religious type either.

294
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,717
<i>I'll</i> have another beer.

295
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,910
Pack it all up, and don't
forget the leftovers for Zorba.

296
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,116
<i>So what's your connection
to this place?</i>

297
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,597
Irony is I live right here.

298
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,269
Oh, do you wanna
sign our petition?

299
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,279
We signed it, thanks!

300
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,515
This struggle made me realize
how connected I am to this place.

301
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,119
Can you explain it to us too?

302
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,630
Thank you, Yomtov. It was good.
-Welcome. Bye.

303
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,590
<i>Go ahead.</i>

304
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,871
I've lived here before.

305
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,798
<i>In your childhood?
- Long before</i> that,

306
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,676
it was our family's orchard.
See, we came from Bavaria.

307
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,560
We were Templers,
and we grew oranges.

308
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,515
<i>Are you saying you lived
right here in a former life?</i>

309
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,592
<i>That doesn't seem
statistically probable.</i>

310
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,589
On the contrary, we're drawn
to places we've lived in before,

311
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,590
to make amends with people
we might have wronged in past lives.

312
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,676
It's not just me, it's true
about everybody here and now.

313
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,195
Hey buddy, come here!

314
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,509
Boris, <i>I'll</i> be with you in a second.

315
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,119
Come here, sign this.

316
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,120
What is this?

317
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,075
A petition to turn this
lot into a park.

318
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,319
What's the problem?

319
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,751
A parking lot, that's what
the tycoons are up to.

320
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,752
On second thought, you know, a few
more parking spots around here

321
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,755
wouldn't be such a bad idea.

322
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,318
'Cause of talk like that and
people like you, no offense,

323
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,516
this whole city's full of parking
lots, and not a single park.

324
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,230
You really think a tent and some
signatures can make a difference?

325
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,953
I'd like to believe so, yeah.

326
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,791
Sounds like a waste of time to me.

327
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,718
Time will tell, buddy.

328
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,437
Good luck with the cause.

329
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,429
If you see Zohar,
tell him I left him this radio!

330
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,635
And say 'hi' for me,

331
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,149
Tzemakh!

332
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,879
<i>Good morning,</i>

333
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,512
<i>A short update concerning
our struggle.</i>

334
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,757
<i>Sony I was offline.
I've been busy.</i>

335
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,513
<i>First oft we've got a new energetic
and hot activist in our ranks.</i>

336
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,954
<i>Even if ideology
isn't his biggest concern,</i>

337
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,198
<i>he makes up for it
with his consistency.</i>

338
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,516
<i>Already a month here, chilling
with his loyal companion, Zorba...</i>

339
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,316
<i>abandoning post only
when necessaly.</i>

340
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,589
<i>The "Mess"!</i>

341
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,551
<i>In other words: a model activist.</i>

342
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,273
<i>More news: we had
a festive day of planting.</i>

343
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,751
I believe we need to "plant
some facts on the ground".

344
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,311
When they take root,

345
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,390
our message will go through,
that the park is already here.

346
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,394
Goodbye... bye...
Thanks for coming...

347
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,071
<i>After eveiyonek gone,
our hero stands guard alone...</i>

348
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,793
<i>...or maybe not alone.</i>

349
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,670
<i>That% all for today, friends.
Stay tuned...</i>

350
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,151
<i>Love you in evely way possible.
Bye.</i>

351
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,280
H3)'-

352
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,118
Long time no see.

353
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,315
Am I early? You want me to come
back after you've left for work?

354
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,034
No... I'm not going.

355
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,799
You alright?

356
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,514
Zorba's been crying all night...

357
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,191
I don't know what to do.

358
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,154
Can I come in and see him?

359
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,675
You can.

360
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,873
Pooch, what's hurting you?
-His back.

361
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,553
He can't stand up.

362
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,276
Come here, wanna go out?
-I've never seen him like this.

363
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,912
<i>I 'm leaving and I won 't be back!</i>

364
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,634
<i>I 'm moving to a fucking hotel...</i>

365
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,560
Why don't you get a divorce
already, you losers!?

366
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,311
<i>I told you the whole building
is listening.</i>

367
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,919
<i>I don 't give a damn!</i>

368
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,671
<i>Have you lost your mind?
Great, ciy all you want.</i>

369
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,554
Hey.
-Hi.

370
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,480
Thanks for coming.
-What's going on?

371
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,992
Zorba's not doing so well,
we're going to the vet.

372
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,955
Poor thing.

373
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,038
You want me to get my dad's car
and we'll drive together?

374
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,114
It's more important that
someone stays here.

375
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,958
But how will you get to the vet...?

376
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,634
Oh, right.

377
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,558
So you finally met her?

378
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,633
How was it?

379
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,593
You're not telling, huh?

380
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,078
Nice to meet you, I'm Teddy.

381
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,556
Hey. You coming?

382
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,714
So...

383
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,236
Be strong. Bye, handsome.

384
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,398
We had our good times,
didn't we, Zorba?

385
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,831
Just like a real family, huh?

386
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,232
That time you were a puppy
and ate all our hash...

387
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,833
and then stared at us looking
so confused, you remember that?

388
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,590
Maybe it's wrong to put him to sleep?

389
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,997
I know that doctor said
it was terminal,

390
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,714
but even a week is something...
-What good is it?

391
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,269
I can't take this, Nitz.

392
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,155
You were with me on this
15 minutes ago, so what... why?

393
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,952
Because I miss him already.

394
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,715
Let's go into the other room.
You got a blanket to put him in?

395
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,318
What can I say, Zorba?
Life sucks, huh?

396
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,076
If you ever come back then...
Drop by, say hello.

397
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,358
Or at least send me a sign.

398
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,835
Sweetie.

399
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,834
It's OK.

400
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,679
Good dog...

401
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,638
Can you turn that shit off?

402
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,998
I can't deal with this
melodrama right now.

403
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,830
Take over, will you,
I can't drive.

404
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,390
You mind?

405
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,396
It's so great coming home

406
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,916
to your womb.
-Shut up already.

407
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,590
If it wasn't for your struggle,
we'd have found a place to park.

408
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,951
Lucky for us, it would have
ruined the moment, no?

409
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,829
Would you say I come too fast?

410
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,509
The circumstances weren't ideal,

411
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,878
but it was fun.

412
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,630
Wasn't it?

413
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,274
Totally.

414
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,157
I'm just asking, you know...

415
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,313
In general, now that you've got
some perspective.

416
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,916
Who says I've gotten perspective?

417
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,156
Right, like you've been
waiting for me?

418
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,874
Is that what your activist girlfriends
told you? That you come too fast?

419
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,117
"Girlfriends"
is taking it a bit far.

420
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,157
Right, "the whole concept
of monogamy is capitalistic".

421
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,473
Did I say that?

422
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,949
Not particularly.
-What?

423
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,272
You, coming too fast.

424
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,829
Who're you comparing me to?
-Stop bugging me.

425
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,556
You really
didn't have anybody else?

426
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,875
You never wanted
to be with someone more...

427
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,638
dunno... different than me?

428
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,918
<i>Does it stress you out?</i>

429
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,235
No.

430
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,515
What?

431
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,631
Kessem, what's your problem?

432
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,833
Give me the keys.
-Aren't we going to bury him?

433
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,509
No way, I'm not coming with you.
-Kessem.

434
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,680
What's with you?

435
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,035
To the life and untimely
death of Zorba.

436
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,149
Poor thing, he was a good dog.

437
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,954
He wasn't a dog, he was a man.

438
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,873
He felt that way too.

439
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,038
"Here Lies Zorba RIP"

440
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,632
You know, on our walks,

441
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,518
dogs would come sniff him,
check him out,

442
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,518
he'd look at me like,

443
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,836
"Do they actually think I'm a dog?"

444
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,238
He loved beer

445
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,839
he hated fights.

446
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,591
He'd cry when we fought.

447
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,039
Also when we fucked.

448
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,989
We done here?
I've got to go.

449
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,069
Can you stay a bit longer?
I've got to pop by Yomtov's.

450
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,317
I've been here
half a day for you.

451
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,350
Five minutes,
a phone call and I'm back.

452
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,193
Use mine.

453
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,553
Yeah, but I've got to...
get supplies for the night.

454
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,477
Okay, then go.

455
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,519
You need anything?
-No.

456
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,474
Go on, then.

457
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,190
What?

458
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,837
Alright...

459
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,836
bye.

460
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,832
<i>Hi, you've reached Kessem,</i>

461
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,475
<i>if you 've got something smart
to say, say it.</i>

462
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,755
<i>You shall love God
with all your heart and soul</i>

463
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,351
<i>These words that I command you
shall be in your heart</i>

464
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,713
<i>And shall be taught to your children
and spoken of when you sit at home...</i>

465
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,957
<i>And you shall bind them as a sign...</i>

466
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,071
Can I have another Shekel, brother?

467
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,918
<i>Write them on the doorposts
of your house and on your gates...</i>

468
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,875
Leave her alone, Nitz.

469
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,193
Put one more on the tab.
-Nitz, Nitzan.

470
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,909
Come pray with me.
It'll do you good.

471
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,999
<i>L'll</i> pray on the way.

472
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,910
To the struggle,
the park and the parking lot.

473
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,553
You see that there?

474
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,873
That's where I used to live.
With Zorba, and Kessem.

475
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,234
We lived there happily ever after,

476
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,393
till one day I disappeared on her,

477
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,473
and now that I'm back,
she's not into me.

478
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,273
She's got a point.

479
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,712
Theoretically, sure,

480
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,595
but today, in the car,

481
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,194
we made love.

482
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,513
After we put Zorba to sleep.
You heard about Zorba?

483
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,153
Let me have that.

484
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,991
Kessem, if you want to call me,
you can get me at this number.

485
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,876
I'm here all night,
so call me, okay?

486
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,354
All of a sudden she flipped out,
ran off without saying why,

487
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,437
won't answer my calls.

488
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,514
What am I supposed to think?

489
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,554
She's playing with you.
-Think so?

490
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,996
If I knew anything about this shit,
I wouldn't be alone out here.

491
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,839
Kessem's not like that.

492
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,271
When we're near each other,

493
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,074
we can't hold back, you know?

494
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,440
Kessem, pick up already,
you trying to drive me nuts?

495
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,992
What's your deal, huh?
-Just let her sleep, man.

496
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,477
Answer the phone, if you don't want
to talk to me, you don't have to!

497
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,390
Just answer it, you whore!

498
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,999
Let her sleep!

499
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,192
You think she's got a guy there?
-How the hell should I know.

500
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,838
Wait here, if anybody calls,
give us a shout.

501
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,270
Kessem!

502
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,037
Goddammit...

503
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,480
Kessem!

504
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,839
I'm going up there.
-What good is that?

505
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,880
If she's got someone up there...
-Listen to me, man.

506
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,550
I'll kill her, kill him,
kill the both of them.

507
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,752
You don't wanna go up there
like this, wait till tomorrow.

508
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,198
Kessem, open the door.

509
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,998
Kessem, I'm coming in.

510
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,670
Open the door!

511
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,953
Who's in there with you?

512
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,439
Open this fucking door,
or <i>I'll</i> break it down!

513
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,916
Everything alright up there?
-Yeah, yeah.

514
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,839
Excuse me...
What's going on?

515
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,716
She's probably locked herself in.

516
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,680
Whadya mean, locked herself?
-She won't open up.

517
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,792
Maybe she doesn't want to see you.

518
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,479
You don't get it...

519
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,350
I'm worried she's
harmed herself, okay?

520
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,111
Does she have a history?
Has she ever tried to...

521
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,677
Talia, get me the phone.
-Okay, sure.

522
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,279
Come down please.

523
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,278
Call an ambulance.
-Not the police?

524
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,629
Gimme the phone.

525
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,069
I need an ambulance to...

526
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,835
Kessem.

527
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,153
Why won't you answer me?

528
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,231
Kessem?

529
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,080
You changed the locks?
-Don't come here anymore.

530
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,915
You know how worried I was?
-Sorry.

531
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,671
I'm not moving till you let me in and
explain why you been ignoring me.

532
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,553
And where were you all night?

533
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,030
Where?!

534
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,799
Get the fuck away!

535
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,311
Kessem,

536
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,634
Open Up, will you?

537
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,271
I'm going to score some stuff.
Keep an eye on the booth, will you?

538
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,229
Kessem!

539
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,909
Can't you hear me calling you?!

540
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,918
Buddy.

541
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,154
Good morning.
Come out, please.

542
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,839
Come on out.

543
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,431
Mr. Tzemakh here is saying
you burned his booth down.

544
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,114
Why'd he put it here?

545
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,311
Why do you sleep here?
This your daddy's lot?

546
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,999
This is public property, darling.

547
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,909
Does that mean you did the burning?
-And if I did, would I tell you?

548
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,072
Look, gasoline.
You've got proof.

549
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,429
This yours?

550
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,154
Yeah, we toss some fish
on the grill every night,

551
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,432
you're welcome to join us,
or is that against the law too?

552
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,758
He is now impeding
an officer of the law.

553
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,156
This is public property.
-No it isn't, you're an anarchist...

554
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,079
Yes it is, our lawyer Nahumi
looked into it.

555
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,237
You can say Nahumi all you want...

556
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,274
It's public, I can do whatever I want.
-Not at all! Not at all!

557
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,834
Nobody will tell me...

558
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,678
Goddammit, the two of you,

559
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,800
Why waste your time fighting?
-Excuse me?

560
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,516
Take your girl to a movie,
go surfing, keep me out of it.

561
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,439
We'll see who has the last laugh.

562
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,919
Excuse me, officer!

563
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,110
Yes, Nitz,
you got something to say?

564
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,430
You wanna drop in
for a quickie in the tent?

565
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,758
I'm not friends with people
who aren't nice to me.

566
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,916
Who said anything about friends,
just a quickie to boost morale.

567
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,755
Get your reward blowjob
from your girlfriend, okay?

568
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,910
<i>Yes, things are definitely heating up.</i>

569
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,679
What's so funny, ha?

570
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,791
It's money I worked hard for.

571
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,753
And a lot more money
rotting away on permits

572
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,236
while shitheads like you
live on your daddy's Visa Gold.

573
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,320
<i>While Tzemakh works the authorities,
we're getting ready for battle.</i>

574
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,553
What? Gas masks?

575
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,198
They're good for tear gas too.

576
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,152
Isn't that going too far?

577
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,834
Who knows how this'll end.

578
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,953
Could you tie the rope to the masks?

579
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,150
What's up?

580
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:49,470
Tzemakh's people destroyed
our eco-garden

581
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,069
while someone was
ditching his post...

582
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,351
I've been sleeping out here
for a month

583
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,631
so you could play at being
Che Guevera, okay?

584
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,674
No, we've been funding your beer
and cigarettes for a month,

585
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,110
while you were partying...

586
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:08,110
You burnt down the booth against
our will and escalated the struggle...

587
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,279
<i>Anger levels are rising to
new heights in our camp as well,</i>

588
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,154
<i>or are these first signs
of an ideological crisis?</i>

589
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,150
Just because you're
a tree-hugging pacifist, and I'm...

590
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,594
You're what now?
-I believe we need to act differently!

591
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,440
<i>Nevertheless,
our park shall arise.</i>

592
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,473
<i>So be yourselves,
and stay tuned...</i>

593
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,150
<i>Teddy.</i>

594
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,910
You see that?
-I did.

595
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,749
Over three thousand hits
since this morning.

596
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,352
It's not about ratings,
it's about the message.

597
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,995
So, what's wrong with our message?

598
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,997
It kinda makes us look like psychos.

599
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,430
Good, let them think
we're psychos.

600
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,314
Make me a Mess.

601
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,319
And add the beers to the tab too.
-Nitz, forget about the beers.

602
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,869
They told me you were off the tab.

603
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,999
Who said that, Lahav?

604
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,993
Beers don't look good on camera?
Or am I being punished?

605
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,194
It's not a punishment, it's a budget
thing. These weeks add up.

606
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,789
Why don't you just let it go?

607
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,231
Here, take your <i>Mess,</i>
and let it go, ok?

608
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,309
With your permission, I'd like
to trade the Mess for beers.

609
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,555
Nitz,

610
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,236
one beer on me and that's it.

611
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,310
OK?

612
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,952
Want some gum, sweetheart?

613
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:16,876
I can't really explain where my
knowledge comes from. It just does.

614
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:20,436
Like when I saw you with Zorro.
-Zorba. -Yeah, Zorba.

615
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,995
I usually don't tell people
about their past lives,

616
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,957
but I thought you'd like to know,
I saw you two together,

617
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,754
back when he was human.
-Obviously.

618
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:37,030
You were still you, but younger,
a sweet little boy, and he...

619
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,437
He was very important
in your life. Impressive, close...

620
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,551
maybe a father.

621
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,195
Is your dad alive?

622
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,798
This is what you're telling me?
That Zorba's my dad?

623
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:04,749
Let's do the math. Was Zorba
born after your father died?

624
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,238
My dad came back as a dog to
sit around my apartment all day?

625
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,872
What about his friends, his wife,
his colleagues or whatnot?

626
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,192
He wasted a whole lifetime on me?

627
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,836
Why say 'wasted'?
You two have unfinished business.

628
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,792
Too bad you didn't tell me sooner.

629
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,997
'Cause now Zorba's dead too.

630
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,635
He's just dead, yeah?
Didn't finish any business. Dead!

631
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,318
Oh, that must have been
so hard for you...

632
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,870
You know, he'll probably be back
sometime, but I'm just so sorry.

633
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,512
I'm sorry.

634
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,155
Why did you tell me
all that anyways, huh?

635
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,957
I felt you were going through a
rough time, I thought it could help.

636
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:58,797
You and your husband scream at each
other like crazy. What's that about?

637
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,157
Huh? Isn't that rough?

638
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,432
True. We do fight a lot.
We've got unfinished business

639
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,110
for quite a few life-cycles...
But we're working on it.

640
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,434
What if he's just a shitty person?

641
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,236
Maybe if you dumped him,
you could have a peaceful life.

642
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,080
Ever think of that?
-Yes, I have.

643
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,910
So how come you're so
sure you shouldn't?

644
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,158
Because the thought
of life without him...

645
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,795
I just don't want it.

646
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,231
Bye...

647
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,957
Kessem, it's me, Eran,
you can open up.

648
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,551
I'm not here to nag,
you left your phone at my place,

649
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,915
SO...

650
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,989
Talk to me.

651
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,996
She ignores me too.

652
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,474
Hey, what's up?

653
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,758
Probably went to her
parents or something.

654
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,759
Why didn't you tell me?

655
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,634
Don't play the victim,
you're the one who ditched her.

656
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,629
So now you're an expert
on who ditched who?

657
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,998
That's what you told me.

658
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,953
So you waited for me
to get on the plane

659
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,719
before you made your move?

660
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,274
No way, man.

661
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,634
So?

662
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,836
Up until yesterday
there was nothing going on.

663
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,629
I swear.

664
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:48,839
So suddenly, after all these years,
she realizes she's into you?

665
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:53,637
Exactly two hours after I fucked her?
Does that make sense to you?

666
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:57,595
Yesterday of all days?
Doesn't it seem strange?

667
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,069
Cut it out.

668
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,669
She's only looking for someone
to fertilize her egg.

669
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,158
Fuck off. -She fucked you just
to drive me nuts, don't you get it?

670
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,469
Friend!

671
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,629
Kessem, slow down.

672
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,275
I'm doing eighty.

673
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,040
Yeah, but it's night, it's dark,
it's winding.

674
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,719
Don't you trust me?

675
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,912
It's not that, it's just that your
driving is stressing me out.

676
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,272
I ever had an accident?

677
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:36,031
Why can't you cool down and drive,
instead of being edgy all the time?

678
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:41,474
Don't change the subject. All of
a sudden my driving's so important?

679
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,719
It stresses me out, okay?

680
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,275
What? My driving or the pregnancy?

681
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,311
You gonna quit smoking now too?

682
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,477
It's not for life, you know.

683
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,595
Why are you stressing out?
A family can be a cool thing too.

684
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,634
Don't get all psychological on me,

685
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,309
just 'cause you had a model family.

686
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,751
You're one fucked-up paranoid,
you know that?

687
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,279
Like I did it on purpose.

688
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,994
You stopped taking your pills.
-It's fattening, I told you!

689
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,272
Then that's why we'll have
a baby, 'cause it's fattening?

690
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,714
Kessem, pull over,
you're going to kill us!

691
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,910
You're driving like a madwoman.
Kessem!

692
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:37,759
Oh, Zorba, no, don't cry...
We're not fighting,

693
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:42,875
Mommy was just singing, and dad
joined in for a duet, right?

694
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,755
You're a good dog,
give me a kiss.

695
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,792
Look at you with Zorba...

696
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,549
you're so good
and loving and caring.

697
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,755
Just because your dad blew it
doesn't mean you will too.

698
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,598
"Mom Calling"

699
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,238
Yeah, mom, we're...

700
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,196
What?
We're on our way.

701
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,475
Yeah.

702
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,434
Alright.

703
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,278
Want me to drive?

704
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,999
Maybe I just need more time
to get used to the idea.

705
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,553
How much time?

706
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,953
Who wanted to get off at Rosh Pina?

707
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,435
<i>Kessem on the Sea of Galilee</i>

708
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:08,549
<i>A moon sings in the blue sky...</i>

709
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,509
Kessem.

710
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,835
Kessem.

711
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,791
I came here to tell you

712
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,435
not a day goes by
I don't regret what happened.

713
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,197
I want you to know I've changed,

714
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,751
that I finally understand
what you knew all along.

715
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:51,189
That you and I are meant to be.

716
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:56,150
"Changed" my ass,
you returned exactly the same.

717
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,478
Waiting for you under your house
for a month proves I've changed.

718
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,560
Oh, poor thing,
waiting for a month.

719
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,355
I sat around for a year
wondering where you were!

720
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,758
So this is revenge now?

721
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,794
If it's revenge say so,
then <i>I'll</i> get it.

722
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,311
No, you won't get it,
you don't get anything!

723
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:23,195
You don't really care, you just hang
on to me to feel like you exist.

724
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,234
You impotent piece of shit, you can't
even tell when you're being loved!

725
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,750
Why are you saying
these things, huh?

726
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:34,273
You trying to ruin everything?
Is that what you want?

727
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,950
Kessem.
Why you gotta do this shit?

728
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,310
Go whine
to your activist girlfriend.

729
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,229
Look who's talking.
You fucked my friend

730
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,478
just to drive me crazy!

731
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,354
Then fuck off already,
just fuck off.

732
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:55,316
No, I will not fuck off.
And you know why?

733
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,358
'Cause I love you.

734
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,551
And you are the woman of my life.

735
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:07,630
Stop bullshittingl
What do you know about love?

736
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,309
What is love for you?

737
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,239
You want romance, is that it?

738
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,957
Here you go, I got your
fucking romance right here.

739
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,599
If you don't fuck off right now,

740
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,918
I'm getting my parents,
they're at the neighbors!

741
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,270
You're getting your parents?
-Go!

742
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,959
Then l'm going-

743
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:36,319
If your parents are so
protective and loving,

744
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,160
how come their daughter's
so screwed up, huh?

745
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:44,912
Besides, if your parents are here,
why isn't their car outside?

746
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,474
Daddy!

747
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,919
How about you and I
part as friends?

748
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:22,637
You did your job, I promise to get
lost, you'll never see me again.

749
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,556
Sorry, brother,
I already called it in.

750
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,195
Letting you leave now would
make me look real bad.

751
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,754
I see.

752
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,119
Hey, whoa!

753
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,832
Where you going?!

754
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,275
<i>I hadn't even brushed my teeth
when I got a call from a neighbor.</i>

755
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,596
<i>He noticed suspicious activity.</i>

756
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,391
<i>So here I am, straight out of bed,</i>

757
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:01,230
<i>bringing to you, live, Tzemakhk
attempt to take over our lot.</i>

758
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,399
Whoa, driver, cut your engine,
stop this tractor right now.

759
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:10,352
Tzemakh, get him out of here,
don't you hear me?

760
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,190
You burned my booth.
You wanted war - you got one!

761
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,630
It wasn't us, OK?

762
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,673
Even if it <i>was,</i> that doesn't
give you the right to invade.

763
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,636
Lahav... move back.
-Watch out Tzemakh...

764
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,198
You looking to go to jail?

765
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:30,991
It's done, I sent it.
-You there at home, come here now...

766
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,994
I've got to get to the lot.
You wanna come?

767
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:39,070
I'm not so sure it's a good idea,
you know I'm kind of a wanted man.

768
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,910
Have it your way, but I've
gotta close up, huh?

769
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,189
Photosynthesis will prevail, Teddy...

770
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:58,512
<i>Today, even the last of the cynics,
regardless of creed, race or gender,</i>

771
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:03,669
<i>are climbing out of their shells
to block this shocking injustice.</i>

772
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,276
<i>We won 't let the forces of evil
build their parking lot here.</i>

773
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,632
<i>But who's there sitting idly by,
if not the legend himselli</i>

774
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:16,357
<i>the dangerous rebel on the loose.
Nitzan, what are you doing here?</i>

775
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:20,349
People, let's gather for a
discussion circle under the tree.

776
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,349
You think I'd miss out on
this embarrassing happening?

777
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,996
Next thing you know,
they'll be holding hands.

778
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,918
You got a better suggestion?

779
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:34,149
Why don't you and I
get the hell out of here?

780
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:37,637
Teddy, you too, we're waiting for
you with the camera under the tree.

781
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,432
Alright, a brief explanation:

782
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:46,271
Brown areas on the map are
meant for public buildings...

783
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:49,831
The court has ruled that a parking
lot is not a public building.

784
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:54,557
That's how I got the
injunction against it.

785
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,991
Yeah, but now they're
fucking us over, how come?

786
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:02,398
This lot belongs to
The Land Administration of Israel.

787
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,989
So everything set by the
municipality doesn't count.

788
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,669
And you just noticed that now?
- Look who's here!

789
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:12,317
They recently rezoned the lot,
there's nothing we can do.

790
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,909
We can stand our ground.
What are they going to do?

791
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:19,079
Tzemakh graciously suggested
that we clear out within the hour,

792
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:24,354
Otherwise he'll personally sue each
and every one of us for damages.

793
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:31,193
Before people start running off,
I suggest we form a plan together.

794
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,315
We've got Judge Gardinger, who's on
our side, supporting the cause.

795
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:40,196
<i>I'll</i> need an hour to look
into that, so bye for now.

796
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:46,199
Hold on, Nahumi, what if you're not
back in an hour? Then what?

797
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,997
<i>I'll</i> be back, but if not then
I suggest we vacate the premises.

798
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,356
Sorry.
-Vacate? No way.

799
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:58,157
We can't give up now.
-Our park will arise!

800
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,029
<i>We met, as always, by chance,</i>

801
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:09,190
<i>I discovered I wasn't even mad anymore,</i>

802
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:15,318
<i>We sat on a bench in the square,
then moved on to her place,</i>

803
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:25,313
<i>She showed me her paintings and
told me she'd been alone for a while</i>

804
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:31,909
<i>I suggested we sleep together,
she said it was a bad idea</i>

805
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:36,993
<i>So we talked some more,
and I walked out to the hot street</i>

806
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:44,113
<i>While struggling with the bicycle
lock, I told myself "I get it now"</i>

807
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:49,510
<i>She was worth her weight in gold</i>

808
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:59,432
<i>Alone for a long, long while...</i>

809
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,199
Block that end off too!

810
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:32,473
Tzemakh, how does it feel to be
the bad guy in this story, huh?

811
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,553
You proud of yourself?
-Yeah.

812
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,316
Friends, I'm really sorry,
I tried my best,

813
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,239
Gardinger said we haven't got a case.

814
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:48,760
Not so fast, Nahumi.

815
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,839
If we don't leave now,
we're risking a law suit...

816
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,274
I'm very sorry, it's time to go home...

817
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:01,196
Tzemakh, this is your chance to say,
let's call off the parking lot.

818
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,471
You live in a disney film or what?

819
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:07,639
Run off, better to scream
at each other all day, isn't it?

820
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,435
If you don't leave now,
you'll lose our legal guarantee.

821
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:15,759
Take your legal guarantee
and make a career off it.

822
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:19,676
Don't you have any unfinished
business with Tzemakh too?!

823
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,279
Don't mind him.

824
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:25,079
Is this all bullshit?
-Bye.

825
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,870
Is this about playing activists?

826
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:36,274
The rabbi said we need
a parking lot here, right?

827
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,871
Shut up already, Nitz.

828
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:44,237
What are we going to believe in now?
What's going to be as cool?

829
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:51,198
Something photogenic
and trendy and shit.

830
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,073
Goddammit, Nitz.
-What is it, Che?

831
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,918
It's depressing enough as it is.

832
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:01,753
What about all the signatures,
the work, the speeches?

833
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,998
What do you want me to do now?

834
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,840
You got a light?
-I quit smoking.

835
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,713
Then fuck off.

836
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,634
Go, your little girl's
waiting for you.

837
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,195
Get away from the tree!

838
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,190
Move it.
-Bye.

839
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:31,837
As the leader here, I'd appreciate
it if you got that clown to give up.

840
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:36,871
He's no clown, he's right, and ifl
wasn't a pussy I'd be there with him.

841
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,840
Come on!
Come, if you're man enough!

842
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,232
I suggest you get down from there.
-Come and catch me!

843
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,193
If I come up there, it'll end badly.
-I can imagine.

844
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,675
You coming, there's a great angle
from up here.

845
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,391
You don't want to come down?
-Now? The fun's only starting.

846
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:34,994
The girl with the camera,
get away from the tree.

847
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,472
You there up on the tree.

848
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:45,230
This is your last chance to get down,
or we'll be forced to take measures!

849
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,398
<i>I'll</i> come down in a sec.

850
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,876
Nitzan, let's go!

851
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,596
Get down, it's dangerous!

852
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:58,193
I'm ready! Do your thing!
I'm waiting!

853
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,755
Please come down!

854
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,716
Go ahead, take me down.
Take any measures you want.

855
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:10,511
Let's have it! Gas me!

856
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,717
Who do you think you are?!

857
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,518
What's your problem?

858
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,076
We love you, Nitz!

859
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:15,990
Stop!

860
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,114
Nitz, wait!

861
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,633
Stop it, Yusuf,

862
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,873
stop, stop!

863
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,233
Cut the engine.

864
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,157
Nitzan, you listening?

865
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:58,560
Mr. Tzemakh here is willing
to drop the charges.

866
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:03,433
I'm not coming down until Tzemakh
and his tractors are gone,

867
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:08,191
and I get a signed document from
the mayor cancelling this parking lot.

868
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,879
Hey, Nitz. Hey, sweetie.

869
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,760
I wanted to say,

870
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:35,638
I feel I shouldn't have told you
about your past lives.

871
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,994
Why not?

872
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,993
I'm worried it confused you,
and now you're taking it too far.

873
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:50,356
You think I'm up here to settle
my unfinished business?

874
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,233
You're not?
-No.

875
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:54,719
Then why?

876
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,315
You got a light?

877
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,720
No, I don't smoke.

878
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:05,310
You can see ten lifetimes back, but
not that a man's dying for a smoke?

879
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,359
Bye, sweetie.

880
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:18,711
You think <i>I'll</i> clear out just
'cause some idiot's waving a rope?

881
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,150
Can you take responsibility
over something like that?

882
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:25,354
You listen here. If this lot isn't
flattened by the end of the day,

883
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:29,554
including that fucking tree,
then my name isn't Tzemakh.

884
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,235
I've got two tractors, a court
order, it's my money, my time.

885
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:38,434
Not yours, and not his.
-Hey Talia, what's up with him?

886
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,793
It's just not his time to get off
the tree yet. I'm leaving now. Bye.

887
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:56,990
Who's there?

888
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,589
It's Zohar, Nitz's friend,
you don't know me.

889
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:00,915
What do you want?

890
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,636
I'm not sure you know,
but he's stuck up on the tree.

891
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,434
Yeah, I saw it, and I've
agreed to drop the charges.

892
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,358
Yeah, but it didn't help.

893
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:13,918
I thought maybe if you talked to him,
he'd be willing to come down.

894
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:20,232
He's got some nerve, after all he put
me through, to ask me for anything.

895
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,351
It ain't him asking, it's me.

896
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,120
Oh yeah, and why would I do
something like that?

897
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,313
He loves you.

898
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:34,149
That's bull. Take a look,
look at how he loves me.

899
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,035
He's stuck on his tree,

900
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:41,871
right in front of my face,
peeking into my house.

901
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:47,029
Obsessed with something
that's been over for a long time.

902
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:50,471
How do you think that
makes me feel? Look at him.

903
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:01,234
Maybe it's inconvenient for you,
but he's stuck...

904
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,239
He's stuck up the wrong tree.

905
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,829
Why does he always
get away with it?

906
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,593
Why does everyone forgive him?

907
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,713
Like he's a little boy or something?

908
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,077
Enough, enough, I'm sick of it.

909
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:20,113
This business with the
rope could end badly.

910
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,470
Don't worry, he won't do it.

911
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,876
What makes you so sure?

912
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,111
'Cause he loves himself too much.

913
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:41,550
Too bad, it ain't healthy,
leaving things open. For you too.

914
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:24,832
You see that there?
There, under the sign?

915
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:29,349
That's Zorba's grave!
You like it?

916
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,349
They want to put a parking lot here
of all places, that seem right?

917
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,029
What do you want, Nitz? What?

918
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:41,598
I want a park
where people can meet up,

919
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:45,999
where kids can play and moms
can come with their strollers,

920
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,759
and you and me too.

921
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:52,592
We can look out
the window at them.

922
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:58,674
And we'll procreate like bunnies,
and live happily ever after.

923
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,439
What do you say?

924
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,439
Maybe, but not in this lifetime.

925
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,914
You coming? It's starting
to get boring here.

926
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,234
Where is there to go?

927
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:34,759
You wanted to disappear
somewhere together, didn't you?

928
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:38,239
So this is your way
of getting me out of this rope?

929
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,910
Don't be heavy. Come on.

930
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:53,758
You won't come just 'cause
I invited you, right?

931
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,670
Run, go ahead, run!

932
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,952
Come here, good dog.

933
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,031
So you're finally back.

934
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,715
Not even a phone call?

935
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,674
Didn't you say you'd quit smoking
till your pregnancy was over?

936
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,712
The pregnancy is over.

937
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:45,999
How can do that without telling me?
It's my baby too.

938
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,637
Then no.
-What?

939
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,637
I haven't done anything yet.

940
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:57,080
Kessem, that's not funny.
Did you or didn't you?

941
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,071
What do you prefer?

942
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,439
You decide.

943
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,430
Zorba?

944
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,753
I'm so glad you came.

945
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:23,236
Zorba...

946
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:32,913
I wanted to tell you I was sorry,
for abandoning you like that...

947
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:40,630
On the other hand, you weren't
the greatest dad either.

948
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,270
Daddy.

949
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:53,398
What's with this problematic
personality you passed on to me?

950
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,831
Couldn't you leave me
an operating manual?

951
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,112
It's fine, I ain't bitter.

952
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,914
It's too late for that, I know.

953
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,438
How about getting me a light?

954
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,351
I'm just joking with you two.

955
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,469
Alright then...

956
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,550
Bye.

957
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,278
When did all this happen?

958
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,676
This morning. You tripping or what?

959
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:00,919
Say, you wanna work with me here?

960
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,236
We'll split our shifts?

961
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:16,516
Thanks, man, but I think
I've had enough of this place.

962
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,791
Take care.
-You too.

963
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,269
