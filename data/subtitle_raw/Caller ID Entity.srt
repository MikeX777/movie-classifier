- I woke up to her
talking to my boyfriend

4
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:27,275
at, like, three in
the morning, um,

5
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:30,793
and it was, because
I had called him,

6
00:00:30,793 --> 00:00:33,931
and I, I just, I don't even know

7
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:36,034
how I dialed his phone
number 'cause I was asleep,

8
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:38,000
or I was in this state.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,586
And I, he, he doesn't
know what I said to him.

10
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:45,724
I just started talking
in, in tongues,

11
00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:49,862
and, uh, after I woke up, I
didn't realize what I had done.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,206
[skittering and jangling
electronic effects]

13
00:00:55,206 --> 00:00:57,206
- [Woman On Recording] Why
do you wanna hurt me so much?

14
00:00:57,206 --> 00:00:58,137
Are you sick?

15
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:01,413
You, you're really strange.

16
00:01:01,413 --> 00:01:05,000
[whirring electronic effects
over ominous ambient music]

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,241
I was like, it's like this
is some kind of addiction

18
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:10,000
that I've gotta break
away from and, uh,

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,551
he encouraged it and he
shoulda just left me alone

20
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:14,758
'cause I don't really
think he cares about me.

21

[crackling electronic effects
over unsettling ambient music]

22
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:20,344
And I don't think
he'll ever understand

23
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:22,137
why I'm the way I, I am,

24
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,896
'cause sometimes I don't
understand it myself.

I don't even know, I, I
don't think he ever loved me.

28
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:38,448
I don't think he
meant it at all.

29
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:39,275
I wish he did.

in grants to
university researchers

36
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:13,724
to study ways to read
people's thoughts,

37
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:16,413
but critics say such
mind reading technology

38
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:18,689
could be used during
interrogations.

39
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:20,482
The project's a corroboration
among researchers

40
00:02:20,482 --> 00:02:22,310

- Right, yeah.

49
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:12,551
You're not makin' it easy.

50
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:15,620

this is that we're at [grunts],

51
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,827
where the station is?

52

to get to Palmdale.

You're sadistic and sick,

58
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:31,000
and I hate your guts.

to play weird games,

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,068

Hey, buddy, give
that back to me!

70
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:51,758

Yeah, I know

00:04:49,068 --> 00:04:50,551
you've got enough evidence,

93
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:52,310
and it doesn't matter
about these calls anymore

94
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,551
because I'm already in
way over my head anyway,

95
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:58,413
so I can just tell
you what I think.

96

If you're trying to
set me up to hurt me,

97

you can do it, so go ahead
and do it, get it over with.

'cause then I'll know for sure

100
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,931

trust you anyway.

You know what I'm

it somewhere safe, OK?

Look, my time has
come, your time is now,

you to stand up,

make precautions, all right?

This isn't a fuckin'
diatribe, it's a eulogy,

139

and understand this is the
last image you're gonna see

140
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:53,310

you need to do.

141

through the specialized
study program.

152
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:17,517
You will be developing
new technologies

153
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:19,000
for the study of the mind.

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,965
I hope you do well in
all your assignments.

155
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:23,551
- Yeah, it's, uh,
actually pretty cool.

156
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:25,551
You get to participate
in an independent study

157
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:27,103
and still, at the end of it all,

158
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:29,793
you get a masters degree
in psychopathology.

159
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:31,275

always wanted to be part

160
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:33,586
of something groundbreaking,
and I think this could be it.

- It's nothing to
stress out about.

Everyone has to go through
the same screening process

172

in order to be accepted
into the program.

173

prevent psychopathologies

that lead to suffering and
often to violent death.

Sometimes, we lose
people from the program

184
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:32,551
because it's just too
much for them to handle.

you emotionally?

00:15:54,206 --> 00:15:56,068
You may be struggling
with it the whole time,

351
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:59,000
but you would inevitably,
would have to surrender to it.

352
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,517

[muffled chatter]

355
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:09,896
- [Noah] You don't happen to
have any acetaminophen, do you?

356
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:11,103
- [Miles] No, not on me.

357
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:16,482
- So, uh, what-what, what do
you think of these assignments?

358
00:16:16,482 --> 00:16:18,620
- I think they're pretty
amazing, actually,

359
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,034
but we're not
supposed to be talking

360
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:22,206
about our specific assignments.

361
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:24,000
It's an independent
study, remember?

362
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:28,000
- I'm having a
difficult time, uh,

363
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,206
digesting these case studies.
[eerie electronic music]

364
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:33,482
They're kind of fucked
up to be honest with you.

365
00:16:33,482 --> 00:16:35,862
- Come on, these
people need our help.

366
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,310
Just give yourself a
little bit of time, Noah,

367
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,000
you're just letting
it get to you.

368
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,206
Hey, do you know a
guy named Dale Wilton?

369
00:16:44,206 --> 00:16:45,793
Wasn't he a friend of
yours from high school?

370
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:47,620
So I heard he enrolled
in the program, too.

371
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:52,000
- Unless he got in, I saw him
at the, uh, reunion, fucker!

372
00:16:53,206 --> 00:16:55,034
Last got in touch with
each other years back.

373
00:16:55,034 --> 00:16:56,379
We had this horrible fight.

374
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:57,379
- [Miles] Ah, bury the hatchet.

375
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:59,000
- Yeah, a friend is a friend.

[eerie and tense

383
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,586
It was a sick game, it
kept getting sicker.

384
00:17:29,793 --> 00:17:32,344
We were like fresh
blood transfusions

385
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:35,551
for a parasitic dictator who
was addicted to immortality.

[muffled chatter over eerie

387
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:44,551
- [Bouncer] ID?

388
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:47,137
- Come on, drink up,
man, you all right?

389
00:17:47,137 --> 00:17:48,689
- Yeah.

390
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:50,172
I'm OK.

391
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:52,241
- Forget about the program,
it's the end of the week.

392
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:53,172
Time to get out.

393
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,689
- All right, I'm good, I'm just,

394
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:56,241
you know, a little
tired, that's all.

395
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,034
- Yeah, you look tired [scoffs].

396
00:17:58,034 --> 00:18:00,241
- [scoffs] Life is
standing upright,

397
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:02,103

bullshit, here, cheers.

[glasses clink]

399
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:05,172
- Can I get a shot of something
real strong, uh, whiskey?

400
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:07,413
- Yeah, my favorite one, too.

401
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:12,000
[eerie and tense
electronic music]

402
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,724
- I'm gonna be in a very
awkward situation in a second.

403
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:17,275
But thank you, wow!

404
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:19,827
- [Miles] No, wait, here
he comes, here he comes.

405
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:22,034
- Really?
[tense, eerie ambient music]

406
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,310
This is way too
fucking confusing--

407
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,620
- Miles, Noah, hey.

408
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,275
- What's goin' on?

409
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,448
- I just wanted to
know if you fuckers

410
00:18:29,448 --> 00:18:32,275
have put the past behind us.

411
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:34,689
- Well, why would
I hold resentment?

412
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:36,551
That's been such
a long time ago.

413
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:37,758
- You know that
bullshit that went down,

414
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:39,931
it's, like, I apologize,
and I'm sorry.

415
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:42,448
- Saw you and Bernice Hall.

416
00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:44,275
Figured you'd become
a psych student.

417
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,758
- It's, uh, it's the only
thing that's inspired me.

418
00:18:48,758 --> 00:18:51,724
- Obviously something, right?

419
00:18:51,724 --> 00:18:53,068
- Don't hate me, man.

[tense electronic music]

421
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,034
It's good to see you guys.

422

- Well, it's, uh,
good to see you.

[tense electro rock music]

424
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:10,068
- That guy over there ordered
you guys a couple of drinks.

425
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:11,034
- [Miles] What guy?

426
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:13,413
- Your friend, Dale.

427
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,448
Two black devils.

428
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,896
- [Miles] I am not
fuckin' drinkin' this.

429
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,448
- He's not being nice anyway.

430
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:24,379
Fuck that guy.

433
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:42,103
- [Cheryl] I'm
writin' a letter here,

434
00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:44,241
and I'm gonna get this off
my chest once and for all.

435
00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:46,172
The letter is to the dean,

436
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:48,689
and I'm really sorry [sighs],

437
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:52,000
but you ruined my
life, you know that?

438
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:56,103
I had a nervous breakdown, you
ruined my fuckin' life, man,

439
00:19:56,103 --> 00:19:59,172
and you did it on purpose,
and, uh, you enjoyed it.

440
00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:02,241
And you deserve for
me to turn you in,

441
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:03,965
I should've turned you
in a long time ago,

442
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:05,241
'cause what you did
to me was wrong.

443
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:07,241
You were sexually
harassing me, I'm sorry,

444
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:08,862
that's exactly what it was.

445

Regardless of whether
I went with it

446
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:11,724
or how I felt about you.

447
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:14,689
That's exactly what is was, OK,
but don't rub my nose in it,

448
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:16,827
because I covered up for
you, you fuckin' prick.

- [Woman On Phone] Yeah, I think
the whole thing was a setup

453
00:20:43,862 --> 00:20:46,896
'cause he's got some kind
of need to play weird games,

454
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:48,862
and his games would get
really dangerous, you know?

455
00:20:48,862 --> 00:20:50,137
He'd better watch out.

456
00:20:50,137 --> 00:20:52,655
I don't need this shit,
I need a normal person.

I may be schizophrenic or

they're getting the funding

They know they can't kill
me because if they do,

470
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:30,793
I've clouded that
information somewhere

471
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:32,000
and someone will find it,

472
00:21:33,413 --> 00:21:35,931
and unless they can get me
to tell them where that's at,

473
00:21:35,931 --> 00:21:37,793
they may actually come out here.

to get off your feet.

confidence in you, Noah.

Over the years, I have developed

- [Camera Operator] Mm-hmm.

510
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,793
- [Man With Mask]
Right, so I was at USC,

511
00:23:42,793 --> 00:23:45,206
and I was, I was a psych major.

512
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:48,586
I had a little job measuring
lie detector results.

513
00:23:48,586 --> 00:23:51,068
My teacher had there in
the psych department,

514
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:53,482
he got me quote
"employed" out there,

515
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:55,379
actually, I was just,
like, the guinea pig

516
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:57,827
for early mind
control experiments,

517
00:23:57,827 --> 00:24:00,068
but the government
were to cover that up

518
00:24:00,068 --> 00:24:03,068
so the ones that were
whistleblowing, like myself,

519
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:05,586
we were under threat because
we were telling the truth

520
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:08,000
and exposing these
people, but, uh,

521
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,724
these people didn't
like to be exposed,

522
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:11,965
so we got threatened
as a result.

523
00:24:13,689 --> 00:24:15,655
[door creaking]

524
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,965
[door thuds]

525
00:24:17,965 --> 00:24:22,620
[car whooshing over
tense electronic music]

526
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,034
- Pleasure, sir.

527
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:25,275
- My pleasure, too.

528
00:24:25,275 --> 00:24:27,000
- [Miles] I'm a big
fan of your work.

529
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,137
- Huh, thank you.

530
00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:30,172
This is a small
follow-through meeting

531
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:32,034
to find out how you are doing.

532
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:33,241
Is everything all right?

533
00:24:33,241 --> 00:24:35,206
- Absolutely, I feel
like I'm finally

534
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:36,724
beginning to understand

535
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,551
how the neurotransmitters
of the brain actually work.

536
00:24:38,551 --> 00:24:40,068
- If we could develop the tools

537
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:44,482
to map the psyche of
disturbed individuals,

538
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:48,551
I believe we could free
them from pain forever.

539
00:24:48,551 --> 00:24:50,896
- [Miles] That's
almost overwhelming.

540
00:24:50,896 --> 00:24:52,000
- [Adam] Are there questions?

541
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,206
- Not specifically.

542
00:24:53,206 --> 00:24:55,275
- [Adam] OK, then,
see you in two weeks.

543
00:24:56,206 --> 00:25:00,344
- [scoffs] OK, thank you.

544
00:25:00,344 --> 00:25:01,517
- By the way,

545
00:25:02,758 --> 00:25:06,655
your friend, Noah,
missed his meeting.

546
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:08,310
You heard something?

547
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,793
You know something about that?

548
00:25:12,793 --> 00:25:14,275
- I don't really know.
[tense ambient music]

549
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:17,517
He stopped returning my
calls and emails days ago.

550
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:21,344
[scoffs] It's like
he just disappeared.

551
00:25:21,344 --> 00:25:23,931
- Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

552
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:27,551
However, you are still here.

553
00:25:27,551 --> 00:25:30,517
Miles, you have a great future.

554
00:25:31,862 --> 00:25:34,620
- [scoffs] Thank you, sir.

555
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,965
- Call me Adam.

556
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:38,862
[eerie ambient music]

557
00:25:38,862 --> 00:25:42,724
[traffic whooshing over
eerie ambient music]

558
00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:46,620
[phone buzzing and whirring]

559
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,103
[static crackling]

560
00:25:48,103 --> 00:25:49,931
- [Cheryl] Is it that you
just wanted to hurt me,

561
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:51,000
or are you just
the kind of person

562
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,931
that likes to hurt people?

563
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:54,827
You can always go work
at my web training,

564
00:25:54,827 --> 00:25:57,620
I hear they like to sexually
harass their students, too.

565
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,724
[train whistle howling over
tense electronic music]

566
00:26:03,655 --> 00:26:05,896
[muffled shouting over
buzzing electronic effects]

567
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:09,034
[electronics buzzing]

568
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,310
[traffic whooshing]

569
00:26:14,724 --> 00:26:17,551
- Most of our work is
done sitting at computers,

570
00:26:17,551 --> 00:26:21,000
but the most challenging
is in the field.

571
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,931
- That's the part I
really wanna get into.

572
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:27,137
- Sexuality, Miles,
is the direct link

573
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:28,724
to the primal scream.

574
00:26:29,793 --> 00:26:32,724
Orgasm is a little death.

575
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:35,172
It's only when we
are close to death

576
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:36,862
that our minds can be pure,

577
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:39,517
and we need that purity
for our experiments.

578
00:26:40,793 --> 00:26:42,000
- [Miles] I can see that.

579
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:45,724
- [Adam] I believe you are
ready for the next level.

580
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:48,620
Make sure you follow
all the instructions

581
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,034
to the last detail.

582
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:52,655
[ominous electronic music]

583
00:26:52,655 --> 00:26:56,827
[footsteps clacking over
ominous electronic music]

584
00:27:00,482 --> 00:27:01,310
- [Miles] Hey.

585
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,758
- Hey.

586
00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:05,413
- [Miles] Haven't I
seen you around before?

587
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:06,689
What's your name?

588
00:27:06,689 --> 00:27:07,517
- Gemini.

589
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:09,758
- Gemini,

590
00:27:11,344 --> 00:27:12,172
please, come in.

591
00:27:17,448 --> 00:27:19,482
[door crunching]

592
00:27:19,482 --> 00:27:23,241
So, Gemini, is that
your real name?

593
00:27:24,724 --> 00:27:27,448
- We don't wanna talk about
our real names, now, do we?

594
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:29,034
- Of course not.

595
00:27:29,034 --> 00:27:32,310
[engine rumbling]

596
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:36,482
[computer buzzing over ominous
and eerie electronic music]

597
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,586
[static crackling]

598
00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:47,000
[traffic whooshing]

599
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,137
[rhythmic, vaguely ominous
and eerie electronic music]

600
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:55,620
[pills rattling]

601
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,862
[rhythmic, vaguely ominous
and eerie electronic music]

602
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:01,620
What are the pills for?

603
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,655
- You don't need to worry
about that right now.

604
00:28:03,655 --> 00:28:07,827
[rhythmic, vaguely ominous
and eerie electronic music]

605
00:28:09,172 --> 00:28:12,034
- [Miles] Give me just a second
to get this thing set up.

606
00:28:12,034 --> 00:28:13,517
[switches clacking]

607
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:16,448
[sighs] Do you ever get
nervous when you're doin' this?

608
00:28:16,448 --> 00:28:17,758
- [Gemini] That's
another question,

609
00:28:17,758 --> 00:28:20,379
you ask so many questions!

610
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:21,586
- [Miles] Let's
just get to work.

611
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:23,103
- You'll do fine.

612
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:27,275
[ominous and unsettling
electronic music]

613
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:38,000
[switches clicking]

614
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,896
[muffled shouting]

615
00:28:39,896 --> 00:28:44,689
No, no, stop, stop [gasps]!
[eerie electronic music]

616
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:48,103
[echoed shouting]

617
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,310
[Gemini gasps]

618
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,379
[tense and unsettling
electronic music]

619
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,241
[computer beeping]

620
00:28:59,241 --> 00:29:02,241
- [sighs] The fuck?

621
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:05,000
Hello?

622
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,206
- Dale, it's me,

623
00:29:06,206 --> 00:29:07,689
you've gotta come out
and meet me right away.

624
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:09,896
You remember the spot
where we used to hang out?

625
00:29:09,896 --> 00:29:14,206
[sighs] You've got to come out
right away [sighs], please.

626
00:29:14,206 --> 00:29:15,931
- Fuck, man, it's
four in the morning!

627
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:17,551
- I need you to do me
this one last favor

628
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:20,413
if you were ever my fucking
friend, do you understand?

629
00:29:20,413 --> 00:29:21,344
Please!

630
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:22,620
- This better be serious.

631
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,862
- There's no time
for explanations!

632
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,379
- All right, give
me half an hour.

633
00:29:25,379 --> 00:29:26,620
[keyboard clacking]

634
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,655
[buzzing and bubbling
electronic effects]

635
00:29:29,655 --> 00:29:30,862
[tense and ominous
ambient music]

636
00:29:30,862 --> 00:29:33,206
Noah!
[footsteps crunching]

637
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:35,827
[tense and ominous
ambient music]

638
00:29:35,827 --> 00:29:37,034
What's goin' on with you,

639
00:29:37,034 --> 00:29:38,758
why'd you wanna meet
all the way out here?

640
00:29:38,758 --> 00:29:40,724
- Copper wiring in the walls.

641
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:42,862
The transmission
can't be traced here.

642
00:29:42,862 --> 00:29:44,034
This entire place
is a dead zone.

643
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:45,551
Don't you remember from class?

644
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:48,689
- Why don't you come back,
finish, get your degree?

645
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:49,517
- Why?

646
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:53,000
So I can grow up
and be like you?

647
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
- So what have you been doing?

648
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,827
- Been collecting things.

649
00:29:56,827 --> 00:29:59,827
Transmissions,
people's testimony,

650
00:29:59,827 --> 00:30:01,758
people who've been damaged.

651
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,068
- So what's so urgent, hmm?

652
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,000
- I intercepted this one
from the Victims Channel.

653
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,620
- What's that?
[tape snapping]

654
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,862
- It's a closed
circuit video blog.

655
00:30:10,862 --> 00:30:12,965
Victims of psychological
torture use it

656
00:30:12,965 --> 00:30:14,620
to communicate with each other.

657
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:17,551
People who have been
psychologically raped

658
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:18,758
are on that tape, Dale.

659
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:20,413
Do you understand how
important that is?

660
00:30:20,413 --> 00:30:22,310
[tense electronic music]

661
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,655
Thank you for coming.

662
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:27,655
[tense and ominous
electronic music]

663
00:30:27,655 --> 00:30:29,275
[keyboard clacking]

664
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:31,310
- I could hear his voice.

665
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,206
It was almost like
about five to 10

666
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,793
people or something like that.

667
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:36,689
All of them kept telling me

668
00:30:36,689 --> 00:30:40,448
a whole bunch of different
things, like how does it feel

669
00:30:40,448 --> 00:30:43,620
to get fucked all the
way through your brains.

670
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,689
I didn't know whether I was
asleep with my eyes closed

671
00:30:47,689 --> 00:30:50,000
and, and everybody
was talking to me,

672
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,724
but they were able to, like,

673
00:30:52,724 --> 00:30:55,172
receive this information
and take it out

674
00:30:55,172 --> 00:30:57,758
and they were also, I
felt like they were trying

675
00:30:57,758 --> 00:31:01,965
to put in, uh, different,
uh, data inside of me

676
00:31:01,965 --> 00:31:04,655
that would make
me destroy myself.

677
00:31:06,413 --> 00:31:08,965
- I would have these
weird aura feelings,

678
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:10,517
like this real, really weird,

679
00:31:10,517 --> 00:31:13,310
like warm, warmth come over me.

680
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,586
It would start with
the fingertips,

681
00:31:15,586 --> 00:31:18,000
and it would, and
also I could feel it

682
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
go up through my veins all
the way up into my head

683
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,931
into the back of my eye.

684
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:27,724
I know there is something being
completely stolen from me.

685
00:31:27,724 --> 00:31:30,724
- Our enemy is a blur.
[tense electronic music]

686
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:34,896
I mean [sighs], assignments,
I don't trust anybody, really.

687
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,413
[traffic whooshing]

688
00:31:37,413 --> 00:31:39,551
- Science is unpredictable,

689
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:41,586
but you're the one
who pushed it too far.

690
00:31:41,586 --> 00:31:44,000
- You didn't tell me
she could die from it!

691
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,206
- She had AIDS.

692
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:48,827
Her time was limited.

693
00:31:48,827 --> 00:31:51,103
I'm sorry about
what has happened,

694
00:31:51,103 --> 00:31:52,793
but we have to take risks.

695
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:53,965
- No, I'm sorry [sighs].

696
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,310
I don't really feel
like I can be a part

697
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,517
of this project anymore.

698
00:31:58,517 --> 00:31:59,758
- But you agreed.

699
00:32:01,103 --> 00:32:02,310
- You can't prove that.

700
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,517
- Let me tell you something.

701
00:32:04,517 --> 00:32:07,689
I have slept with
many of my students

702
00:32:07,689 --> 00:32:11,793
with no risk of being
reported, no risk at all,

703
00:32:11,793 --> 00:32:15,965
because I record the
girl telling me how
much she wants me.

704
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:21,275
So I have her
consent on the tape,

705
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:25,000
like I have yours
concerning our project.

706
00:32:26,172 --> 00:32:28,620
Our future on this
planet is precarious,

707
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,896
and yet we have
to evolve somehow.

708
00:32:31,896 --> 00:32:36,137
To capture the essence of
the human being, his mind,

709
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:39,034
his personality, come on, Miles!

710
00:32:39,034 --> 00:32:42,000
You worked on the project, you
know what I'm talking about!

711
00:32:43,793 --> 00:32:46,586
I can make this
situation go away.

712
00:32:46,586 --> 00:32:48,344
[tense electronic music]

713
00:32:48,344 --> 00:32:50,862
But you have to help me.

714
00:32:50,862 --> 00:32:52,586
Someone is making threats.

715
00:32:52,586 --> 00:32:56,724
It's a former student of
mine who had some problems,

716
00:32:56,724 --> 00:33:00,000
but I think I have a good
idea how to find her.

717
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,793
- There's one student,
she disappeared,

718
00:33:02,793 --> 00:33:04,241
but we're gonna find her

719
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:06,689
using technology
we've developed here,

720
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:09,413
and trust me, we're
all fully committed.

721
00:33:09,413 --> 00:33:12,862
[tense electronic music]

722
00:33:15,724 --> 00:33:18,000
[electronics buzzing
and whirring]

723
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,551
- [Mysterious Woman] But
once, in the olden days,

724
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:22,379
they used to, um, cut one
arm and then cut one hand,

725
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,000
and then they could travel
and they could speak

726
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,620
to each other by
touching that wound.

727
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,448
When we actually
tested this again,

728
00:33:28,448 --> 00:33:30,586
we took our college, uh, student

729
00:33:30,586 --> 00:33:32,344
and we took some of his blood,

730
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,724
and we had him take a log,

731
00:33:34,724 --> 00:33:36,172
what girlfriend,
what did he eat,

732
00:33:36,172 --> 00:33:37,965
how did he feel, what
type of tests did he take,

733
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:39,413
what time did he go to sleep,

734
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:41,241
and for three months,
his blood reacted

735
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:43,620
to exactly what was going
on with him, exactly.

736
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,689
So in the same ways as blood

737
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:49,137
holds electricity and waveforms,

738
00:33:49,137 --> 00:33:51,655
they could do the same
thing with another person.

739
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:55,827
[tense, vaguely eerie
ambient electronic music]

740
00:33:57,586 --> 00:33:59,344
- [Mysterious Man] I knew for
me it was a new beginning.

741
00:33:59,344 --> 00:34:01,620
I felt this power
that was nothing

742
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,275
like I'd ever felt before.

743
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:05,206
There was nothing that
I couldn't accomplish.

744
00:34:05,206 --> 00:34:06,862
I could do anything.

745
00:34:06,862 --> 00:34:08,862
It filled a hole, a void inside

746
00:34:08,862 --> 00:34:10,379
that I had since I was a child,

747
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:14,931
but I still knew that I had to
do whatever was asked of me.

748
00:34:15,793 --> 00:34:17,862
I was going to find Cheryl,

749
00:34:17,862 --> 00:34:19,931
otherwise, who knows
what would happen.

750
00:34:22,758 --> 00:34:24,827
- [Dale] Another part
of the facility, huh?

751
00:34:24,827 --> 00:34:26,344
- The way that you
see everything.

752
00:34:26,344 --> 00:34:27,448
- Yeah, it's cool.

753
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:28,724
- Cameras everywhere.

754
00:34:28,724 --> 00:34:29,551
- Yeah.

755
00:34:30,758 --> 00:34:34,034
- So tell me, how's
your work, tell us.

756
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:36,034
- Yeah, they're very
good, I'm excited.

757
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,689
I think I'm breaking
through some barriers.

758
00:34:37,689 --> 00:34:38,965
- Good.

759
00:34:38,965 --> 00:34:42,103
Now, do you know what is
the meaning of theater?

760
00:34:42,103 --> 00:34:43,413
- Uh, live theater, like plays?

761
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:44,241
- [Adam] Yes.

762
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:45,448
- Entertainment?

763
00:34:45,448 --> 00:34:48,689
- With theater
was born the mask.

764
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:53,689
It hides the face
of whoever wears it,

765
00:34:53,689 --> 00:34:56,241
his identity, and
at the same time,

766
00:34:57,448 --> 00:34:59,413
the vibration of the brain,

767
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:03,586
suddenly, this mask
reflects their power.

768
00:35:05,931 --> 00:35:08,103
As a next assignment, Dale,

769
00:35:08,103 --> 00:35:09,931
I want you to wear it.

770
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,965
Meet the divine.

771
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:15,724
- [Dale] Uh, thank you, I'm, uh,

772
00:35:15,724 --> 00:35:17,482
I'm lookin' forward to this.

773
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,689
- Good.

774
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:21,310
- [Dale] All right,
yeah, thank you.

775
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:27,620
[traffic whooshing over
tense electronic music]

776
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:32,241
[rhythmic electronic music]

777
00:35:49,827 --> 00:35:51,586
[phone whoops]

778
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:53,275
- Oh my God, he's on his way.

779
00:35:53,275 --> 00:35:54,724
[bird fluttering]

780
00:35:54,724 --> 00:35:58,517
[snickers] He looks
really cute, I'm excited.

781
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:02,620
I get tired of
talkin' to pigeons

782
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,758
all the time, you know, guys?

783
00:36:04,758 --> 00:36:07,000
As cool as you are, no offense.

784
00:36:08,275 --> 00:36:10,379
[rhythmic electronic music]

785
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:13,206
[Jeanie chuckles]

786
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:16,517
Be good, OK, watch the fort.

787
00:36:17,482 --> 00:36:19,000
Bye, babies.

788
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,137
[traffic humming over quietly
tense electronic music]

789
00:36:28,827 --> 00:36:30,034
Hey, Dale?

790
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,931
Jeanie.

791
00:36:31,931 --> 00:36:33,689
- Hi, thanks for coming out.

792
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:36,724
- You're even better
looking in person.

793
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:40,896
- So are you, so, you
wanna go somewhere?

794
00:36:40,896 --> 00:36:43,275
- [Jeanie] Yeah, totally,
where do you wanna go?

795
00:36:44,482 --> 00:36:48,000
- Um, oh, I figured
I'm just kind of a,

796
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:51,413
I'm stressed out, I'm
a, I'm a psych student.

797
00:36:51,413 --> 00:36:52,655
I've been doin' a lot
of studying, you know,

798
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:54,724
so I'm just, uh, a
little overwhelmed.

799
00:36:54,724 --> 00:36:57,000
- Yeah, man,
school's killing me.

800
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,241
I'm doing internet marketing.

801
00:36:58,241 --> 00:37:00,758
- [Dale] Wow, that sounds heavy.

802
00:37:00,758 --> 00:37:03,965
- Yeah, it's a lotta
work, a lotta work.

803
00:37:03,965 --> 00:37:05,206
- [Dale] So you understand
what I'm sayin'?

804
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:08,172
- Totally, hey, do have
anything to get high?

805
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:10,965
- [scoffs] Uh, depends on
what you get high with.

806
00:37:10,965 --> 00:37:13,827
- Uh, well, I'm feelin'
like a, a downer,

807
00:37:13,827 --> 00:37:17,517
like, um, vikes or oxies
or somethin', you know?

808
00:37:17,517 --> 00:37:19,379
Somethin' to just chill,
chill me out [chuckles].

809
00:37:19,379 --> 00:37:20,655
- Yeah, I've got
a bad back, so I,

810
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,172
I think I've got 30
milligram oxycodone.

811
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:24,137
- [Jeanie] What?

812
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:25,103
- I do.

813
00:37:25,103 --> 00:37:26,034
- Oh, man.
- I do.

814
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:28,000
- 30 milli, that's awesome, yes!

815
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
- It's better than 10.

816
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,068
- [chuckles] Yeah, it is!

817
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:32,344
Wow, they look real.

818
00:37:32,344 --> 00:37:33,551
- They're real.

819
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:34,379
- Eh, I don't like
to take stuff that's,

820
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:35,965
you know, bad for me.

821
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:37,172
- [Dale] Yeah, no, I understand.

822
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,448
- [Jeanie] This is
cool, this'll just--

823
00:37:38,448 --> 00:37:40,034
- [Dale] Be careful
drinking, you know?

824
00:37:40,034 --> 00:37:42,517
- Eh, gimme a minute.

825
00:37:42,517 --> 00:37:43,689
- There you go.

826
00:37:43,689 --> 00:37:45,448
[rhythmic electronic music]

827
00:37:45,448 --> 00:37:47,275
So, do you like cam sex?

828
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:49,172
- [scoffs] Sometimes, yeah.

829
00:37:49,172 --> 00:37:52,000
- Sometimes, I like
masks, you know?

830
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,206
Plays out your
subconscious, your id.

831
00:37:55,137 --> 00:37:56,689
- [Jeanie] Your id?

832
00:37:56,689 --> 00:37:58,827
- Desire for love and sex,
controlled by your libido,

833
00:37:58,827 --> 00:38:00,965
and then the desire for
death and aggression.

834
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:02,862
These two competing
instincts, you know,

835
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:05,586
build up in the id
causing tension,

836
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:08,448
and you gotta
release that tension.

837
00:38:09,517 --> 00:38:11,000
- [Jeanie] Wow!
- You feel me?

838
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,517
- [chuckles] I'm all about
releasing tension right now.

839
00:38:13,517 --> 00:38:14,793
- [Dale] Yeah, absolutely.

840
00:38:15,724 --> 00:38:17,275
[engine rumbling]

841
00:38:17,275 --> 00:38:19,068
The journey begins.

842
00:38:19,068 --> 00:38:20,482
- [Jeanie] I'm excited.

843
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:23,620
So ready, I could fuckin'
use a cool change.

844
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,896
- [Dale] Oh, it's gonna be cool.

845
00:38:24,896 --> 00:38:26,482
[Jeanie laughs]

846
00:38:26,482 --> 00:38:28,586
All right, Jeanie, I have
something to ask you.

847
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:30,103
- Ask me.

848
00:38:30,103 --> 00:38:31,344
- [Dale] How would you feel

849
00:38:31,344 --> 00:38:32,689
if you I wanted you
to be blindfolded?

850
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:35,310
- Uh--

851
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,517
- [Dale] Would
that freak you out?

852
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:38,379
- No, man, that's kinda
kinky, I'm into it.

853
00:38:38,379 --> 00:38:39,620
- You up for it.

854
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,000
- All right, I, I feel
like I gotta trust you.

855
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,827
You seem, like, you know, kinky.

856
00:38:42,827 --> 00:38:44,103
[traffic whooshing]

857
00:38:44,103 --> 00:38:48,448
[moans passionately] Yeah, yeah!

858
00:38:48,448 --> 00:38:51,793
Oh, yeah [laughs]!
[unsettling electronic music]

859
00:38:51,793 --> 00:38:55,517
Yeah [moans], yeah!

860
00:38:55,517 --> 00:38:59,620
[Jeanie moaning passionately
over eerie electronic music]

861
00:39:03,103 --> 00:39:05,413
[Jeanie laughs]

[Jeanie gasps and moans]

00:39:08,793 --> 00:39:11,620
[Jeanie chuckles]

864
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,482
[Jeanie gasping over
eerie electronic music]

865
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:21,206
Yeah [gasps], yeah, oh yeah!

866
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:26,448
[Jeanie gasping and shrieking
over eerie electronic music]

867

I've been holding to
this side of my head,

924

might be looking for [sighs].

If it were up to you,
we'd be serial killers?

That's not the
point, you understand

OK, do you agree that I'm
the voice of reason here?

I'm trying, didn't
I just try, right?

We have got an open
mind, all of us.

987
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,620
We've gotta listen to each other

and understand where
each one is coming from.

Everyone here is
trying to make sense.

1045
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,931
- You can't leave.

1046
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:32,896
- Yeah, right?

1047
00:48:35,137 --> 00:48:36,137
- [Dale] Hey, Kamal!

1048
00:48:37,379 --> 00:48:40,275

it under control.

1067
00:50:34,344 --> 00:50:36,103
- Hey, you people
just have this need

1068
00:50:36,103 --> 00:50:38,103
to manipulate and
control other people.

1069
00:50:38,103 --> 00:50:39,827
That's really sick.

1070
00:50:39,827 --> 00:50:41,000
Yeah, only you're
not any healthier

1071
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,241
than anybody else, none of you.

1072
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:45,862
I think you're all really
sicker than most human beings .

1073

00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:19,965
- I got into a car accident,

1094
00:52:19,965 --> 00:52:24,517
and some people helped me
before the ambulance got there.

1095
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:27,862
I don't know, they were, like,
some other kind of ambulance,

1096
00:52:27,862 --> 00:52:32,620
and once I, at the hospital,
I don't know exactly when,

1097
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,103
what happened to me, I mean,

1098
00:52:34,103 --> 00:52:37,344
they say that they stick
their finger up your, uh,

1099
00:52:37,344 --> 00:52:40,586
anus to, for reflex, um,

1100
00:52:40,586 --> 00:52:42,241
but I don't know,
sometimes I wonder if maybe

1101
00:52:42,241 --> 00:52:46,000
they did stick
something, um, in there.

1102
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,344
Some kind of, uh,
chip or something,

1103
00:52:49,344 --> 00:52:51,206
'cause after the car accident,

1104
00:52:51,206 --> 00:52:53,793
I felt like I had
to be reborn again.

1105
00:52:55,862 --> 00:52:58,206
- [scoffs] This is the
only place that's safe.

1106
00:52:58,206 --> 00:53:01,482
There's no wires
that are above me

1107
00:53:01,482 --> 00:53:04,620
that are not
grounded to the dirt.

1108
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:07,344
The dirt keeps, keeps the arc

1109
00:53:07,344 --> 00:53:10,896
from coming off of
their power lines

1110
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,379
and shooting through, I mean,

1111
00:53:13,379 --> 00:53:16,586
I've seen, I've seen the
television completely off.

1112

[mimics electrical buzz] Go
right, right out and turn white.

It, it doesn't matter,

1114
00:53:25,413 --> 00:53:26,965
it doesn't even have
to be plugged in.

1115
00:53:26,965 --> 00:53:28,793
They can, they can,
they can make a,

you know that I need your help.

1120
00:53:39,862 --> 00:53:43,413
They're trying to fucking kill
me with invisible waveforms.

1121
00:53:43,413 --> 00:53:46,310
Get all of the incriminating
data from the tests

1122
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:48,310
and the people
who've been tested on

1123
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:50,620
and the ones that
are still out there.

1124
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,206
I have it all back
up into the cloud,

1125
00:53:52,206 --> 00:53:54,379
but if I were to die,
which is very likely,

1126
00:53:54,379 --> 00:53:58,413
I have it all encapsulated,
uh, titanium flash drive.

anything about me, I mean,

[sniveling] you don't
understand how much you hurt me.

The great and glorious science,

1170
00:56:33,896 --> 00:56:36,000
are you proud of what
you've accomplished?

- What do you mean?

1172
00:56:37,379 --> 00:56:40,689
Somebody's gotta infiltrate,
see what's going on.

1173

You're certainly
not doin' it, Noah.

Somebody's gotta
be on the inside.

are on the inside of you.

you talking about,

Let me ask you something.

1179
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:54,310
Do you think you can take
them on on your own, huh?

1180
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,068
You need me as
much as I need you.

1181

out what it's like

1182

when they're done using you?

1183

1185
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:03,931
Not in this pathetic life.

00:57:07,689 --> 00:57:09,241
You gotta trust somebody.

talking about, Noah?

- This is everything I've
collected so far, do you get it?

1192
00:57:26,586 --> 00:57:30,758
This is all the tapes, my
tapes, the victims' tapes,

1193
00:57:32,034 --> 00:57:35,000
this is my life, and
I am giving it to you.

1194
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,965

happens to me,

1195
00:57:37,965 --> 00:57:39,172
what do you want me to do?

[tense, pulsing

1197
00:57:42,275 --> 00:57:43,965

1198
00:57:43,965 --> 00:57:46,103
[scoffs] look inside
the briefcase.

1199
00:57:46,103 --> 00:57:47,620
You're gonna find
some information.

1200
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,137
Follow the instructions exactly

1201
00:57:49,137 --> 00:57:50,965
then destroy any extra
copies to make sure

1202
00:57:50,965 --> 00:57:52,551
that the feds don't get them,
do you understand me, Dale?

1203
00:57:52,551 --> 00:57:56,413
- Yeah, if that time comes,

1204
00:57:56,413 --> 00:57:58,000
you can trust in me.

1205
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,034
- How long have we
known each other?

1206
00:58:00,034 --> 00:58:02,068
- [Dale] Long time, why?

1207
00:58:02,068 --> 00:58:05,241
- Remember I was so
idealistic that I,

1208
00:58:05,241 --> 00:58:07,448
now you're working
on secret patents

1209
00:58:07,448 --> 00:58:11,137

We're still friends, right?

1212
00:58:16,724 --> 00:58:18,586
- Yeah, of course we're friends.

1213
00:58:18,586 --> 00:58:20,379
We'll always be close.

1214
00:58:20,379 --> 00:58:21,620

I didn't realize that
Whitney was manipulating us.

show you who I am!

- Blog dude from the,
from the Victims Channel?

1253
01:00:37,758 --> 01:00:39,482
Show me that you're unarmed.

[ominous ambient music]

1255
01:00:45,413 --> 01:00:47,000
Turn your fucking

1256
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,793
You, you need to
process all of this!

1257
01:00:48,793 --> 01:00:51,551
This is where, this is where
they test it on the victims,

[grunting] all the tapes,
everything comes from here!

1259
01:00:56,172 --> 01:00:58,758
You gotta be quick,
though, we gotta hurry!

1260
01:00:58,758 --> 01:01:02,931
[insects chirping over

1261
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,344
Are you ready to hear this?

1262
01:01:06,344 --> 01:01:08,000
- [Victims Channel Rep]
Just tell your story.

1263
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,103
- The test started off
with whenever we get a

1264
01:01:10,103 --> 01:01:13,000
person who came into the
psychiatric part of the school.

1265
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,034
We would, um, first
inject them with this dye,

1266
01:01:16,034 --> 01:01:17,862
I thought it was a
dye, which later on,

1267
01:01:17,862 --> 01:01:22,000
I come to find out is a, some
kind of nanotechnology liquid

1268
01:01:23,689 --> 01:01:26,379
that's not even classified
to use on people,

1269
01:01:26,379 --> 01:01:28,275
but it makes it so we can see

1270
01:01:28,275 --> 01:01:30,448
how the synapses
of the brain are,

1271
01:01:30,448 --> 01:01:33,758
are communicating with that
part of the body at that moment.

1272
01:01:33,758 --> 01:01:36,241
The ultimate goal is
to create a weapon

1273
01:01:36,241 --> 01:01:38,310
that doesn't even
kill people but,

1274
01:01:40,206 --> 01:01:42,344
it can wipe out
massive amounts of,

1275
01:01:42,344 --> 01:01:46,482
of, of brain frequency
and basically turn
people into sheep.

met you in the library.

1280
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:15,793
I, I really did like you.

1281
01:02:16,793 --> 01:02:18,000
Wow.

1282
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,586
- Adam Whitney, I
wrote this book.

1283
01:02:19,586 --> 01:02:20,862
- Cheryl.

1284
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,068
I was so stupid to think
you were a nice person.

1285
01:02:24,275 --> 01:02:25,758
You know, I thought
we could get along,

1286
01:02:25,758 --> 01:02:28,482
but if you didn't want me,
you should've just let me go.

1287
01:02:28,482 --> 01:02:30,896
[button clicks]

1288
01:02:30,896 --> 01:02:33,482
- They've tapped into
the, the whole grid

1289
01:02:34,586 --> 01:02:36,034
where if she comes within

1290
01:02:37,482 --> 01:02:40,482
any of those cameras, and
we, we get glimpses of her,

1291
01:02:40,482 --> 01:02:43,689
and we can pick up on her
waveform, but then she's gone.

1292
01:02:43,689 --> 01:02:47,517
If somehow they're able
to, uh, find her frequency

1293
01:02:47,517 --> 01:02:50,482
or whatever it is that's
leaving the messages,

1294
01:02:50,482 --> 01:02:53,172
then more people are gonna die.

1295
01:02:53,172 --> 01:02:58,000
I mean, there's no evidence
the, that the woman is real.

1296
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,827
She could just be some cloud

1297
01:03:00,827 --> 01:03:04,896
just drifting through the
wires, through the fiberoptics,

1298
01:03:04,896 --> 01:03:06,689
and, and, and theoretically,

1299
01:03:06,689 --> 01:03:09,206
she could be implanted
into someone else's mind,

1300
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,827
and I think that that's what
he's the most afraid of.

1301
01:03:13,827 --> 01:03:15,517
If, if, if this doesn't get out,

1302
01:03:15,517 --> 01:03:18,275
more people will be
missing, you know?

1303
01:03:18,275 --> 01:03:20,586
More tests'll be done, but
people don't know that.

- You're gonna go
to the third floor.

1355

Whitney's retina
scan is on that chip.

1356

It'll give you complete access
to anywhere in the system.

right, I'll get what I can.

anything, you know?

Heh, and then you go

1389
01:08:22,137 --> 01:08:25,551
- [PA Announcer] Now arriving
Vermont/Santa Monica Station.

1390
01:08:25,551 --> 01:08:28,068
Exit here for Los
Angeles City College.

[rumbling ambient tones]

1392
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,965
Stand clear, the

[eerie and ominous
ambient music]

1396
01:08:51,482 --> 01:08:53,379
- I read this thing
recently about the dinosaurs

1397
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:56,034
becoming extinct is because
they found this iridium

1398
01:08:56,034 --> 01:08:59,413
that was along the, it
was all along the fossils,

1399
01:08:59,413 --> 01:09:01,034
that it's not found,
like, on Earth.

1400
01:09:01,034 --> 01:09:02,896
It's, like, they find
it in outer space, yeah,

1401
01:09:02,896 --> 01:09:04,137
so they found that,
like, the earth,

1402
01:09:04,137 --> 01:09:05,758
there must've been these
meteorites or something

1403
01:09:05,758 --> 01:09:08,586
coming from outer
space that made the,

1404
01:09:08,586 --> 01:09:10,379
that eradicated the dinosaurs.

1405
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:13,655
- Yeah, that's their
life, you know that.

1406
01:09:13,655 --> 01:09:16,344
- So, I really like this part
here that she has to say.

1407
01:09:16,344 --> 01:09:18,206
This chapter about how
to make experiments

1408
01:09:18,206 --> 01:09:20,724
with biological
transmutation successful.

1409
01:09:20,724 --> 01:09:21,827
Like, that's really interesting,

1410
01:09:21,827 --> 01:09:23,793
it's, like,
one-of-a-kind research.

1411
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:25,655
- You know, it's just research.

1412
01:09:25,655 --> 01:09:28,586
Two plus two equals four.

1413
01:09:28,586 --> 01:09:29,931
- It's kind of cold in here.

1414
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:31,620
Do you maybe wanna
get out of here,

1415
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:34,034
maybe go to my
place for a drink?

1416
01:09:34,034 --> 01:09:36,103
- Very sweet, but
I can't, I can't.

1417
01:09:36,103 --> 01:09:37,448
I have to go back
to the project.

1418
01:09:37,448 --> 01:09:39,275
It takes all of my free time.

1419
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:40,931
- Maybe I could come with you?

1420
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:43,655
I'd really like to see what
you've been working on.

1421
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:47,793
- [Adam] You sure?
[rhythmic electro rock music]

1422
01:09:47,793 --> 01:09:50,586
- [Cheryl] Yeah, I'm totally
sure, I'd really like to go.

1423
01:09:52,241 --> 01:09:53,896
- OK, let's pick up my car.

1424
01:09:53,896 --> 01:09:54,862
- [Cheryl] Mm-hmm.

1425
01:09:54,862 --> 01:09:58,724
[rhythmic electro rock music]

1426
01:09:58,724 --> 01:10:01,724

[eerie and ominous

1428
01:10:07,275 --> 01:10:12,137
- [Computerized Voice] Preview
and identification completed.

1429
01:10:12,137 --> 01:10:14,344
- [Cheryl] Wow, this
place is amazing!

1430
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:16,413
- My lab, and I'm proud of it.

1431
01:10:16,413 --> 01:10:19,413
- So, Adam, do you
have any children?

1432
01:10:19,413 --> 01:10:21,655
- I always dream
of having a family,

1433
01:10:21,655 --> 01:10:23,758
but you know how it is
once you get married.

1434
01:10:23,758 --> 01:10:25,517
50 percent of your
time for the wife,

1435
01:10:25,517 --> 01:10:27,275
50 percent of your
time for the kids,

1436
01:10:27,275 --> 01:10:30,137
another 50 percent for
the career, what's left?

1437
01:10:30,137 --> 01:10:34,310
So I focus on my work,
and in some ways,

1438
01:10:36,137 --> 01:10:38,758
my students are my children.

1439
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:45,758
[door rattling over
ominous ambient music]

1440
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,103
What you are about to see I
shouldn't really show to nobody.

1441
01:10:52,103 --> 01:10:53,137
You understand that?

1442
01:10:53,137 --> 01:10:55,034
- Yeah, you make
me feel special.

1443
01:10:55,034 --> 01:10:59,103
- Here, here we see the cutting
edge of mind technology.

1444
01:11:01,482 --> 01:11:03,862
Nobody's authorized
to do this but me.

1445
01:11:03,862 --> 01:11:05,586
Everything here, all the labs,

1446
01:11:05,586 --> 01:11:09,482
the whole project is being
financed by the government.

1447
01:11:09,482 --> 01:11:11,379
There are special
parts of this program

1448
01:11:11,379 --> 01:11:13,482
that I have to do
separate from the school

1449
01:11:14,862 --> 01:11:16,758
so that there is
no interference.

1450
01:11:16,758 --> 01:11:18,034
- What is this place?

1451
01:11:18,034 --> 01:11:19,965
- It's OK, I'm the
only one to use it.

1452
01:11:21,103 --> 01:11:24,241
To tell you the truth,
I really need your help.

1453
01:11:25,172 --> 01:11:26,655
- What do you mean?

1454
01:11:26,655 --> 01:11:30,275
- I have to record
a human waveform.

1455
01:11:30,275 --> 01:11:31,172
- You mean the bioplasma?

1456
01:11:31,172 --> 01:11:32,655
- Yes, exactly!

1457
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:35,000
And I need someone
as dedicated as I am

1458
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,758
to be able to analyze
it completely.

1459
01:11:38,724 --> 01:11:40,586
- What do you need me to do?

1460
01:11:40,586 --> 01:11:43,344
[ominous ambient music]

1461
01:11:43,344 --> 01:11:44,827
- [lips smacking] Trust me.

- If this gets in the wrong
people's hands, we're fucked!

1471
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:31,344
Do you get it, fucked!

1472
01:12:31,344 --> 01:12:32,551
Chill out.

1473
01:12:32,551 --> 01:12:34,413
It's getting people's
mind, their souls!

1474
01:12:34,413 --> 01:12:36,103
Am I the only one here
who wants to live, guys?

1475
01:12:36,103 --> 01:12:37,310
I wanna live!

1476
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:39,965
Come on, I know, we had
no father, I get it!

1477
01:12:39,965 --> 01:12:41,310
Where's all this
hate coming from?

1478
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:42,241
We had nothing!

1479
01:12:42,241 --> 01:12:43,482
Where did this come from?

1480
01:12:43,482 --> 01:12:44,413
Talk to him!

1481
01:12:44,413 --> 01:12:45,896
Will you please let me talk?

1482
01:12:45,896 --> 01:12:47,413
I'm gonna end up killing myself,

1483
01:12:47,413 --> 01:12:49,827
can you please help
me out, Dale, please?

1484
01:12:49,827 --> 01:12:52,275
You're everything that I
never wanted to be, OK?

1485
01:12:52,275 --> 01:12:54,172
He fucking used you man!

1486
01:12:54,172 --> 01:12:55,689
Ask him when we talk.

1487
01:12:55,689 --> 01:12:58,413
That's the whole reason that
we're even in this mess!

1488
01:12:58,413 --> 01:13:00,310
Does anyone here understand me?

1489
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:02,068
It's not about pers, Dale,

1490
01:13:02,068 --> 01:13:03,689
it's not about personal issues!

1491
01:13:03,689 --> 01:13:05,517
Can't you understand that?

1492
01:13:05,517 --> 01:13:06,586
Can't you understand that?

1493
01:13:06,586 --> 01:13:07,793
What the hell is wrong with you?

1494
01:13:07,793 --> 01:13:09,000
We all need each
other, you need me,

1495
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,517
you need me, we need
each other, Dale!

1496
01:13:10,517 --> 01:13:13,793
Do you guys understand
right now, single-handedly,

1497
01:13:13,793 --> 01:13:16,965
we're the most powerful
group of people in the world,

1498
01:13:16,965 --> 01:13:18,517
and if you guys were with me,

1499
01:13:18,517 --> 01:13:19,793
we could be unstoppable!

1500
01:13:19,793 --> 01:13:22,482
OK, what do you want me to do?

1501
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:24,448
Do you want me to be
somebody that I'm not?

1502
01:13:24,448 --> 01:13:25,517
What do you want me to do?

1503
01:13:25,517 --> 01:13:26,758
I want you to get every message,

1504
01:13:26,758 --> 01:13:30,000
every testimonial, every
bit of data, every CD,

1505
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,206
every incriminating evidence
that we possible could have

1506
01:13:33,206 --> 01:13:34,827
and destroy it, now!

- [Adam] I believe you are
ready for the next level.

1518
01:14:32,931 --> 01:14:36,034
- I'm so glad I could help you.

1519
01:14:36,034 --> 01:14:38,310

[shuddering percussion accent]

1532
01:15:51,793 --> 01:15:55,206
The second law of thermodynamics
says that entropy,

1533
01:15:55,206 --> 01:15:59,068
the random disorder of energy
and matter in a system,

1534
01:15:59,068 --> 01:16:00,862
always increases with time.

It's as if whenever she
goes through the wires,

her waveform is amplified,

1537
01:16:08,103 --> 01:16:12,068

anywhere at anytime.

1546
01:16:52,517 --> 01:16:54,413
- Seem to think because
you're a psychologist

1547
01:16:54,413 --> 01:16:57,448
that you know more about
how to live life than I do,

1548
01:16:57,448 --> 01:16:59,482
but I don't play these kinds
of sick, psychotic games

with other people's heads, do I?

1550
01:17:01,172 --> 01:17:04,448
No, see, you people just
have this need to manipulate

1551
01:17:04,448 --> 01:17:06,758
and control other people,
that's really sick.

1552

You know, and you're not any
healthier than anybody else.

None of you, I think you're all

most human beings.

You're really sick people.

[ominous and eerie
ambient music]

1559
01:17:47,379 --> 01:17:49,275
I call, suppose I
call the police,

1560
01:17:49,275 --> 01:17:50,655
and you deserve for
me to turn you in.

1561
01:17:50,655 --> 01:17:52,586
I shoulda turned you
in a long time ago

1562
01:17:52,586 --> 01:17:54,137
'cause what you did
to me was wrong.

1563
01:17:54,137 --> 01:17:55,793
You were sexually
harassing me, I'm sorry,

1564
01:17:55,793 --> 01:17:57,517
that's exactly what it was.

1565
01:17:57,517 --> 01:17:59,000
Regardless of whether
I went with it

1566
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,172
or how I felt about you,
that's exactly what it was,

1567
01:18:01,172 --> 01:18:03,379
OK, but don't rub my nose in it,

1568
01:18:03,379 --> 01:18:04,965
'cause I covered up for
you, you fuckin' prick!

1569
01:18:04,965 --> 01:18:07,689
[eerie screeching

[muffled shrieking and gasping]

1571
01:18:10,517 --> 01:18:14,172
- [Cheryl] [sobs] No [gasping]!

1572
01:18:14,172 --> 01:18:17,172
[Cheryl whimpering]

1573
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:20,172
- You're coming with me.

1574
01:18:20,172 --> 01:18:24,344
[eerie and ominous
ambient music]

1575
01:18:30,344 --> 01:18:31,862
- [Man With Mask]
Adopted children

1576
01:18:31,862 --> 01:18:34,310
and children in placements
are, uh, prime targets.

1577
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:36,793
You can get a child
out of a placement,

1578
01:18:36,793 --> 01:18:39,000
mind control it, and
then bring it back.

1579
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,517
Nobody knows the difference,

1580
01:18:40,517 --> 01:18:44,206
so later on in life, when they
need to fast-track somebody,

1581
01:18:44,206 --> 01:18:46,413
they use these people that
they've mind controlled

1582
01:18:46,413 --> 01:18:48,758
earlier in their life
when they were young.

1583
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,172
- Do you guys realize
that if we get caught,

1584
01:18:52,172 --> 01:18:54,103
we're going to prison forever!

1585
01:18:55,482 --> 01:18:56,689
I'd rather be dead.

1586
01:18:56,689 --> 01:18:58,724
Fuckin' A, man, we gotta
pull this together!

1587
01:18:58,724 --> 01:19:00,482
I'd definitely
rather you be dead!

1588
01:19:00,482 --> 01:19:03,137
This should've been decided
an hour ago, am I right?

1589
01:19:03,137 --> 01:19:05,758
Listen, you listen,
everybody in the world,

1590
01:19:05,758 --> 01:19:07,379
every person is different.

1591
01:19:07,379 --> 01:19:09,172
Everybody has a
different purpose,

1592
01:19:09,172 --> 01:19:10,793
everyone has a different reason.

1593
01:19:10,793 --> 01:19:13,137
I'm already dead, guys!

1594
01:19:13,137 --> 01:19:15,310
OK, guys, let's come together!

1595
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:17,793
You, you, let's come
together, look at me!

1596
01:19:17,793 --> 01:19:22,275
Look at me, look at me,
let's pull it together, OK?

1597
01:19:22,275 --> 01:19:23,517
Are you with me, huh?

1598
01:19:23,517 --> 01:19:25,689
We can do it, you
can do it, come on!

1599
01:19:25,689 --> 01:19:27,620
Yeah, it's the best idea
I've ever heard, let's go.

1600
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:30,862
Right now, let's fuckin' do it!

1601

[gun rattling]

1608
01:20:01,827 --> 01:20:05,379
- Look at who I
am, look at me now!

1609
01:20:05,379 --> 01:20:08,172
- Neither of us knew
what could happen.

1610
01:20:08,172 --> 01:20:09,655
- You were always the expert!

1611
01:20:09,655 --> 01:20:12,137
You knew this
could happen to me!

1612
01:20:12,137 --> 01:20:15,275

1615
01:20:18,931 --> 01:20:21,068
You didn't kill me,
'cause I'm already dead!

[gun rattling]

1617

[tense ambient electronic music]

1618
01:20:28,862 --> 01:20:30,724
- [Miles] You like
to torture people!

1619
01:20:32,413 --> 01:20:33,379
- [Adam] What?

1620
01:20:33,379 --> 01:20:34,689
- You like to study pain!

1621
01:20:34,689 --> 01:20:35,655
- [Adam] Hey, hey,
hey, I-I-I didn't,

1622
01:20:35,655 --> 01:20:37,379
I don't want to hurt nobody!

1623
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:38,655
Stop, stop, stop it, stop it.

1624
01:20:38,655 --> 01:20:40,689
Come on, come on!
- And neither did I.

- Look, look, you
don't understand.

1631
01:20:54,448 --> 01:20:56,448
I was just trying to
purify their souls

1632
01:20:56,448 --> 01:20:59,310
for our experiment,
you know that!

1633
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:00,724
I am not a bad person.

1634
01:21:01,724 --> 01:21:03,068
- Maybe I'm a bad person.

[gunshot cracking]

1636
01:21:04,896 --> 01:21:07,862
It's only when we're close
to death that our minds are--

1637
01:21:07,862 --> 01:21:09,448
- Please, please, please
don't, don't shoot!

1638
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:11,482
I-I'm, please, no-no, please!
- Don't, don't what?

Wait [gasps], you
did it [gasping].

worked, it worked!

[gun clicking]

1645
01:21:35,241 --> 01:21:36,482
They're gonna come after us,

they're gonna find out
everything about us!

They're gonna find
out everything!

1648
01:21:41,379 --> 01:21:42,931
- I burned all my files, Dale.

1649
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:47,758
I suggest you do the same.

[distant siren blaring]

1651

- [Dale] What's the
matter with you?

1652
01:21:51,413 --> 01:21:52,896
What's the matter with you!

1653
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,172

- I was embarrassed in
front of a bunch of people.

1661
01:22:21,275 --> 01:22:23,655
I looked like a goddamn fool,

1662
01:22:23,655 --> 01:22:26,827
and I don't know why because
I didn't do anything to you.

1663
01:22:26,827 --> 01:22:28,689
Maybe you're just sadistic.

1664
01:22:28,689 --> 01:22:30,379
You ruined my life.

Preserve for it for
the fucking guinea pigs

1669

There is a theory

1673
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:02,896
that there is an entity

that created all

It could actually

become entities in
front of your face.

1677
