1
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:18,624
Hello.

2
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,131
How are things?

3
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:41,530
I see!

4
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,100
I was just thinking...

5
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,881
Milk goes in the fridge.

6
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,850
That too.

7
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,874
Is it Wednesday already.

8
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,514
Been working hard?

9
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,181
What at?

10
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,873
No, there weren't many...

11
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,423
- What?
- People.

12
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:38,146
Coffee's settling.

13
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:40,823
We've always brewed,
haven't we?

14
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,651
So what?

15
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:48,476
Did you buy apricot marmalade?

16
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:49,917
What about it?

17
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,906
You bought apricot marmalade.

18
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:54,384
Yes?

19
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:56,075
For as long as I can remember,

20
00:04:56,126 --> 00:04:58,540
we've always eaten orange marmalade
in this house.

21
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:35,255
Can I have your name?

22
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,446
Orr.

23
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:37,993
Or what?

24
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,485
Sorry?

25
00:06:39,587 --> 00:06:40,668
Or what?

26
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:43,056
Karl-Henrik Orr.

27
00:06:43,156 --> 00:06:45,735
Two first names...
Can I have your surname?

28
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:48,064
Orr.

29
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,497
Or? Or your surname.

30
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,150
My name is Orr.

31
00:06:53,394 --> 00:06:54,723
On can be called Orr...

32
00:06:55,302 --> 00:06:56,518
Or not?

33
00:06:57,271 --> 00:06:59,083
We'll put down Knott.

34
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:00,658
Not what?

35
00:07:00,943 --> 00:07:02,458
Karl-Henrik Knott.

36
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,653
My name's not Knott either.

37
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,427
Write... You write it.

38
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,056
Wake up!

39
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:35,251
Can you wake up?

40
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:38,779
I'm in a bit of a hurry, you see.

41
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:42,790
It's going to press earlier
than I thought.

42
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:45,555
We're calling ourselves "Just Then"
instead of "Just Now".

43
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,898
Everything is happening so quickly.
We want to be sure it's right.

44
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:53,539
We at "Just Then" only just found out
that you were "Just Here".

45
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,703
Don't ask how,
we never reveal our sources.

46
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:00,098
I've known your wife
for quite a while.

47
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:01,665
May.

48
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,671
Shall we get started, then?

49
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:21,554
My name's Anna-Berit.

50
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:22,960
Hello!

51
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:29,905
WHAT for?

52
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,855
Maybe I should explain!

53
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,960
We've just now
started a new series...

54
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,948
which is called
"The New Single Man".

55
00:09:42,838 --> 00:09:45,104
There has to be debate
about the single man.

56
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:47,186
It's been going on in Germany
for ages...

57
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,893
but we're the first
to take it up here.

58
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,622
You and I?

59
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:54,988
The magazine, "Just Then"!

60
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,418
Can't you start
with someone else?

61
00:09:58,543 --> 00:10:00,379
I'll be happy to be interviewed later...

62
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:03,660
when I've been single a bit longer.

63
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:06,520
No we have to begin
with the fist reaction.

64
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,035
One leaves home
without explanation...

65
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:17,434
Then without explanation,
a note is found...

66
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,207
telling where one went.

67
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,625
"One"?

68
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:22,473
Meaning a single man like you.

69
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,973
I suggest this is
significant singles' behaviour.

70
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:31,047
A regular singles' impulse.

71
00:10:31,512 --> 00:10:32,571
And then?

72
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:35,059
The question is, if one is...

73
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:37,160
on the way to molding his life...

74
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,961
in a social vacuum...

75
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:43,775
or a new social scenario.

76
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:49,151
I think one is about to
launch a whole new social game theory.

77
00:10:49,878 --> 00:10:54,360
Transforming one's role-play

78
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,620
in better communication
with the criterion of truth.

79
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,737
Can I write like that?

80
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:03,745
Did I say that?

81
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:05,420
No, but that's what I'm asking.

82
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:07,806
I don't know what to say.

83
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:11,220
We'll say that,
as it agrees with May's version.

84
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,349
So she has a version?

85
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:18,261
Did she mention marmalade?

86
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,417
Has Dad already left?

87
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:32,566
Wasn't he home last night?

88
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:35,816
Is he traveling somewhere?

89
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,833
You know very well that
he wasn't home last night...

90
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,883
and that he's not
going away anywhere.

91
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,219
Oh no!

92
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,766
No what?

93
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,534
I don't think there's another woman.

94
00:11:57,672 --> 00:11:59,289
I'd never believe that.

95
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,633
I thought that was what
we always believed.

96
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:04,063
So what is it?

97
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,406
In front of the children

98
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:08,469
it's all sweetness and light
between Mummy and Daddy.

99
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,745
Aren't you in a hurry?

100
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:15,561
What a farce!

101
00:12:28,452 --> 00:12:29,827
Did you want some more?

102
00:12:30,234 --> 00:12:32,015
- What?
- Toast.

103
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,390
No thanks.

104
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,573
I thought I'd try the new marmalade.

105
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:39,630
If you don't get a move on soon,
I'll scream!

106
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:41,642
A quote from Hemingway...

107
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:43,080
"All we do is...

108
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:45,927
play our new records
and try new marmelades."

109
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,939
It's impossible Hemingway
could have said that.

110
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,724
He was talking about drinks,
of course.

111
00:12:51,663 --> 00:12:53,251
What's your problem?

112
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:55,935
Is it just not done,
to quote Hemingway in the morning?

113
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,650
Hi! I was just coming to see you.

114
00:13:11,798 --> 00:13:13,009
I was on my way out.

115
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:14,611
Come along then!

116
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,986
I forgot something!

117
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,001
I didn't forget anything.

118
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,501
Am I typical?

119
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,982
Of what?

120
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:39,353
Single behaviour?

121
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:41,798
I'll ask our experts.

122
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:45,815
Do single behaviour experts
already exist?

123
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:49,073
Or has the magazine
called in some Germans?

124
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,065
You're defensive.

125
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
How?

126
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:02,300
You're defensive
about the term "single man".

127
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,858
I'm transforming my role-play

128
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:08,096
but protecting myself
at the same time.

129
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,046
Are you trying to be funny?

130
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,479
I just wanted to help.

131
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,603
You want pictures, too?

132
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:18,198
Yes, the back of your head,
when you're talking.

133
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,956
The back of it?

134
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,120
You must stay anonymous.

135
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,074
Where are you going?

136
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:29,315
I'm not going anywhere!

137
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,456
Maybe I have no desire at all
to be just an anonymous single man!

138
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,319
Maybe I am defensive...

139
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:45,995
but why do I have to
be anonymous?

140
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,874
You should think about your family, too.

141
00:15:51,756 --> 00:15:53,818
Alright... back of my head.

142
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:00,701
So...

143
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,993
- Is this alright?
- It's fine.

144
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:06,566
If you could just lean
to the left...

145
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,629
Turn your face a little more
towards me.

146
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:13,785
It doesn't matter
if your cheek shows.

147
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:16,281
May used to say
that I have soft cheeks.

148
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:18,374
She wouldn't know me
without soft cheeks.

149
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:20,042
She knows it's you.

150
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,184
But if you want to,
you can turn back your face.

151
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:26,751
She used to scratch my neck
when I was driving.

152
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:28,578
But that's a long time ago.

153
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,240
No... Change places.

154
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,089
Don't look so stiff.

155
00:16:54,257 --> 00:16:55,960
I'm trying to look right.

156
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:58,607
I'm trying to be anonymous
and single.

157
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:01,170
But everything about me
is associated with something.

158
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,685
You've misunderstood this.

159
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:05,936
That's maybe typical...

160
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,952
when one has passed
the impulse stage.

161
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,982
Are you trying
to make fun of me?

162
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,873
I'm not really sure.

163
00:17:19,678 --> 00:17:23,045
I feel rather nervous about
being called "the new single man".

164
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,888
Damn it, you've got a great face!

165
00:17:28,938 --> 00:17:31,699
Shame we have to use
the back of your head.

166
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,047
How do I look?

167
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,455
Chic.

168
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:12,120
How?

169
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:13,534
What is?

170
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,827
You are.

171
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,503
The dress is.
You, in the dress are.

172
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,478
<i>"For you to know where I am."</i>

173
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,017
I don't understand that.

174
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,693
That was what was on his note.

175
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:30,982
How would I know where he was?

176
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:33,736
That’s the big question.

177
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,668
That I knew where he was?

178
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:39,011
Red always works well!

179
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,199
- Do you want to look at something else?
- No, this is good.

180
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:52,574
Am I still chic?

181
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:01,441
Because in that case...

182
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,527
Coffee or tea?

183
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:20,128
Coffee.

184
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:22,320
Anything else?

185
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:24,668
Orange juice...

186
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:26,355
and toast.

187
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,324
2 boiled eggs - 4 minutes.

188
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:31,827
Cheese?

189
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:33,816
Yes, but nothing two strong.

190
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,457
Marmalade?

191
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:40,386
Marmalade?

192
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:44,560
I can bring it anyway.

193
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,066
No marmalade!

194
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,953
Tea with cream and sugar...

195
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,056
and grapefruit juice...

196
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,584
one fried egg, well done...

197
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:55,424
and two Danish pastries
with strong cheese.

198
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,646
- Instead of the other one?
- Yes.

199
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:00,791
And 2 Danish pastries
with cheese?

200
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Strong.

201
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,829
Hi, sweetie!

202
00:20:09,728 --> 00:20:11,981
- How are you?
- Fine.

203
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,849
Has Dad gone away for good?

204
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:25,026
Why would you think that?

205
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:27,018
I see you've bought
a new dress...

206
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:30,047
What's that got to do with it?

207
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,860
I don't know if he's coming back.

208
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,235
He could have said something
or wrote something... or called...

209
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:39,520
or phoned you.

210
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:43,504
Well, as a matter of fact
he did leave a note.

211
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:45,418
So he's a nice guy.

212
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,573
Go wandering off
and then come back...!

213
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:50,276
Anyone would think
I was an armchair.

214
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,000
He gets up and sits down
and gets up and sits down.

215
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,541
What the hell is it all about?

216
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,979
You were brought up
in armchairs.

217
00:21:01,353 --> 00:21:03,963
Grandpa and grandma
were very liberal.

218
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:09,968
And you and Dad
are so damned uptight.

219
00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:11,633
Don't try with me, anyway!

220
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:14,286
We're not trying anything
at all with you.

221
00:21:14,585 --> 00:21:16,417
But when you say

222
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,866
"Grandma and grandpa
were very liberal people"

223
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,680
as if it were nasty.

224
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:24,040
What on earth was nasty
about that?

225
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:27,170
You say so many
things I don't like.

226
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:30,640
It would be better hear that Grandma
and Grandpa made eyes at each other.

227
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,642
That certainly did not happen.

228
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:36,238
Anything would be better to hear
than what you fucking say about them!

229
00:21:38,602 --> 00:21:40,534
You've started swearing a lot.

230
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:46,422
Because I can.

231
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,316
What's a little swearword compared
to the way you answer me?

232
00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:53,065
It's lucky I swore... it gave you
a reason to talk back to me.

233
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,253
What really is my radical-socialist-
liberal-moderate mother all about?

234
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:01,018
Is that supposed to be funny?

235
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:03,234
You always comment about
how I speak...

236
00:22:03,408 --> 00:22:05,142
but never about what I say.

237
00:22:05,517 --> 00:22:07,712
One has to be totally
drawing-room-polite.

238
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:30,708
I promise you'll get to see
all the material.

239
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:32,782
The material...?

240
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,198
What's your opinion?

241
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:49,065
I was as careful as possible.

242
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,784
If there's something you'd like
to change, can we discuss it.

243
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,836
That isn't everything...

244
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:14,971
There are others,
apart from you.

245
00:23:23,578 --> 00:23:24,635
Well?

246
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,776
I'm already stuck.

247
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:32,085
I barely made it out the door.

248
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:35,444
What do you mean?

249
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,366
What's this?

250
00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:48,633
Should everyone in
the publishing house find out

251
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:51,485
that my husband is
"The New Single Man"?

252
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,741
It doesn't matter at all.

253
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:04,519
I assume
that "single man" means...

254
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:09,803
that I can notify the university
that he is either sick, or well.

255
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,295
Both can be reason enough
to withdraw from teaching.

256
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,813
But I think you've abused a trust...

257
00:24:17,863 --> 00:24:21,053
if you want to get
any sort of reaction,

258
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:23,245
which I guess you do.

259
00:24:23,936 --> 00:24:25,839
What a conventional reaction!

260
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,470
Yes, that's possible.

261
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,783
You can interpret Karl-Henrik's behavior
from a conventional point of view

262
00:24:34,204 --> 00:24:36,041
But from that,
we learn nothing...

263
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:38,806
It only reinforces
our prejudices.

264
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:43,416
What does that have to do
with your articles?

265
00:24:46,377 --> 00:24:48,869
I think I've been a help.

266
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,861
People look at you and Karl-Henrik
in a warm and sympathetic way.

267
00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:57,357
Didn't they before?

268
00:24:58,478 --> 00:25:02,322
Other people's tolerance
threshold is lower.

269
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:04,560
Higher.

270
00:25:07,002 --> 00:25:08,221
What do you mean?

271
00:25:08,427 --> 00:25:10,364
You must've meant higher.

272
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,040
You're so negative with me.

273
00:25:15,838 --> 00:25:18,143
I just want to make the world
a bit better.

274
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,893
For you to know where I am.

275
00:25:27,315 --> 00:25:28,926
For you to know...

276
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:30,830
...that I DO exist.

277
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,543
Hi!

278
00:25:59,598 --> 00:26:00,684
Hi.

279
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,403
- You're sitting here?
- Yes.

280
00:26:18,015 --> 00:26:19,707
- I'm sitting here.
- Yes.

281
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:27,207
- Hi!
- Bye bye.

282
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,185
No, I'm sorry!

283
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:33,044
I'm sorry!

284
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,411
Well?

285
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,036
Well what?

286
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,904
Aren't you going to fuck me now?

287
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,771
What did you say?

288
00:28:06,982 --> 00:28:09,622
I'd be very surprised
if you hadn't heard me.

289
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,472
Yes... but did I hear you right?

290
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,950
You did, for sure.

291
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,598
Aren't you going to fuck me now?

292
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:33,820
That's what I said.

293
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,739
Or is it enough that dear cousin

294
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:41,602
presses his thigh against mine,
under the table at the family dinner?

295
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:49,524
Or to push his knee
between my thighs during the dance?

296
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,125
Or accidentally grabs my breast?

297
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,403
Or nibbles my ear...

298
00:28:57,775 --> 00:29:00,078
with one eye on Karl-Henrik?

299
00:29:04,897 --> 00:29:06,389
Maybe that's enough for you?

300
00:29:08,336 --> 00:29:11,422
I think that's quite nice.

301
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,176
But fucking is out of the question?

302
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:17,106
Is that for your sake or mine?

303
00:29:17,337 --> 00:29:18,574
Or for Karl-Henrik's sake?

304
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,313
Or maybe, just for
the sake of morality?

305
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,621
Most likely it's for
Karl-Henrik's sake.

306
00:29:32,056 --> 00:29:34,642
How does it usually go
in the movies and novels...?

307
00:29:40,228 --> 00:29:41,876
Can they never
invent anything else?

308
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,545
I'll sweep that up.

309
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,727
You master your miserliness
so nicely.

310
00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:12,161
What do you actually want?!

311
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:14,978
I want your decision as to
whether or not you'll fuck me.

312
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,642
Is it going to happen?

313
00:30:18,587 --> 00:30:20,638
Are you afraid it will put paid
to the niceties?

314
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:22,728
That things would get serious?

315
00:30:22,783 --> 00:30:25,861
All the sweet little feelies
and suggestions.

316
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,321
You've not seemed
completely unmoved and insensitive.

317
00:30:37,423 --> 00:30:38,641
My God...!

318
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:43,454
Is it a sign of indifference that
I'm here asking salacious questions?

319
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,877
- No...
- No, what?

320
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:52,544
- Karl-Henrik doesn't know I'm here.
- I didn't ask that.

321
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,313
No, not that, either.

322
00:30:57,227 --> 00:30:58,231
Either what?

323
00:30:58,282 --> 00:31:02,430
I won't talk about it afterwards...
whether it comes to something, or not.

324
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,387
Marriage has become
so quiet these days...

325
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:07,630
Arrangements get made
through third parties.

326
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:16,282
But, May...

327
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,872
Don't try with some sort of intimacy!
Just don't!

328
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,317
You can fuck me,
or not fuck me.

329
00:31:23,004 --> 00:31:25,692
Observe I'm not saying "Let's fuck."

330
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,603
That's something
I'd find agreeable.

331
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:29,876
You use the word "fuck"
quite a lot.

332
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:33,489
But it's really not arousing.

333
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,078
Maybe it helps get YOU hot?

334
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:39,356
Do not tell me
about my inhibitions!

335
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,364
You did break your glass, though.

336
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,760
That's starting
to get pretty childish.

337
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,961
What do you mean?

338
00:32:06,106 --> 00:32:08,242
Should we just play games
and tease each other?

339
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,192
In that case, you are
completely wrong.

340
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,786
Anyway, children's games
have a meaning.

341
00:32:13,787 --> 00:32:15,278
You and your clumsy moves...

342
00:32:15,328 --> 00:32:17,851
Your glances,
and your roving hands!

343
00:32:17,984 --> 00:32:19,788
I guess I'm getting old.

344
00:32:19,998 --> 00:32:21,396
Outdated methods.

345
00:32:29,954 --> 00:32:32,541
You're not exactly
in your first flowering.

346
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:34,971
Do you think I'm going
to cry over it?

347
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:37,419
Possibly.

348
00:32:38,661 --> 00:32:41,731
But I do doubt it.

349
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,514
For that would also trigger
a sloppy intimacy...

350
00:32:46,618 --> 00:32:47,800
that wouldn't fit well...

351
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,395
with your sweetly erotic advances...

352
00:32:51,982 --> 00:32:53,709
that are so refined.

353
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:57,403
Come and sit here,
so I can grope you.

354
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,451
Because we're alone, I can I take it
further than I usually do.

355
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,670
But right now, I do not have...

356
00:33:07,396 --> 00:33:09,521
the slightest bit of lust for you.

357
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,697
Maybe I just don't have the time...

358
00:33:15,514 --> 00:33:18,639
or the capacity to stumble
through an act of intercourse.

359
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,896
Why don't you sit down?

360
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:27,026
Is it inappropriate for me
not to be horny?

361
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:29,323
Am I not behaving as I should?

362
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:36,338
No... You're certainly not.

363
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,549
That probably explains
your so-called charm...

364
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:49,651
it's never quite what it should be.

365
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:53,018
But be very careful, Edvard!

366
00:33:54,057 --> 00:33:56,995
Your little flirtatious put-downs...

367
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,737
"Taking liberties", as it's called...
Are they still to be taken?

368
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,515
Are those liberties tasty?

369
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:18,445
Nope.

370
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:20,613
What do you know
about my liberties?

371
00:34:20,914 --> 00:34:22,859
Maybe it's yours
that don't taste so good.

372
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,543
I prefer my own taste.

373
00:34:27,748 --> 00:34:29,834
If it doesn't fit, it doesn't fit.

374
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,709
For example, I don't like that dress...
not on you.

375
00:34:35,428 --> 00:34:39,614
It takes away some of that
arousing confined accessibility.

376
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:44,833
The bits that are such fun to fondle.

377
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,986
It does nothing for you.

378
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,543
It does not highlight
your assets.

379
00:34:55,157 --> 00:34:56,942
Your resources of...

380
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:02,887
...neatly- and tidily-wrapped lusts.

381
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,499
If you have some, now.

382
00:35:06,051 --> 00:35:08,200
Otherwise one can toy
with the thought...

383
00:35:08,934 --> 00:35:10,340
that they may still be found.

384
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,578
Then one can get oneself
a little excited...

385
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,081
and feel alive.

386
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,765
Am I alright this way?

387
00:35:21,573 --> 00:35:23,690
Is this what you like
to hear from me?

388
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:26,121
Without the least bit
of yucky intimacy!

389
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,656
You're excellent.
Really brilliant.

390
00:35:28,995 --> 00:35:31,190
I've never seen you in red.

391
00:35:33,987 --> 00:35:37,161
It maybe the novelty of it
that makes it seem silly.

392
00:35:37,211 --> 00:35:39,280
You want me to always
be the same.

393
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,550
With knees under the dinner table.

394
00:35:41,979 --> 00:35:43,855
One day when we're really old...

395
00:35:44,034 --> 00:35:46,925
you'll confide in me that
you used to have the hots for me.

396
00:35:47,088 --> 00:35:48,824
That's as much as you'll dare.

397
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,459
Is that what I'll get from you?

398
00:35:54,065 --> 00:35:57,572
Or just the whisper
of an old man?

399
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:00,830
One has to cherish one's memories.

400
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,520
Everything to please the man.

401
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,243
Oh no, not at all.

402
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,017
You want to make yourself
as unpleasant as possible.

403
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,548
I don't know what I should do.

404
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,287
- No!
- Well, you can't go home like that.

405
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,633
You can't come home
without a dress on.

406
00:36:40,683 --> 00:36:42,998
That's nothing to do with you!

407
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,420
Maybe there's no one at home?

408
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,760
Or maybe it's someone...

409
00:36:53,741 --> 00:36:55,551
who's not at home?

410
00:36:57,262 --> 00:36:59,031
Maybe that's why...

411
00:37:00,664 --> 00:37:02,875
you're exposing me to this!

412
00:37:06,715 --> 00:37:09,523
Do you think I'm going
to cry over this?

413
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,758
So that maybe you get to be
comforting and understanding.

414
00:37:14,808 --> 00:37:16,422
Just get dressed!

415
00:37:17,812 --> 00:37:19,364
Don't you want me?

416
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,669
You look straight at me...

417
00:37:22,298 --> 00:37:24,200
but you've already
started to swallow.

418
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:28,184
You surely have had thoughts
about how it would be?

419
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,413
Yes, of course.

420
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:34,757
It's just that it has
so little to do with you.

421
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,210
Those channels are so worn...

422
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,483
that thoughts and fantasies
can easily flow through them.

423
00:37:44,608 --> 00:37:47,278
You break into my habits...

424
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:50,177
in order to break your own.

425
00:37:50,255 --> 00:37:52,174
Your quite a talker aren't you!

426
00:37:53,197 --> 00:37:55,244
Yes, so it's said.

427
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,588
In conversing with you,
my mouth just takes over.

428
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,000
Cheers, Aunt Elsa!

429
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:09,617
Always so nice to see you.

430
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,944
You're an asset
at these frigging parties.

431
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,199
Karl-Henrik is happy
with his professorship?

432
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,426
Everyone complains
about so much paperwork...

433
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,371
though the education minister
has promised less bureaucracy.

434
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,918
How's Ellen? Does she get
anything out of school?

435
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,621
It's likely not that easy now,
with the move to a modern school.

436
00:38:42,665 --> 00:38:45,785
It's such a protracted transition!

437
00:38:49,418 --> 00:38:50,594
What about summer?

438
00:38:52,877 --> 00:38:54,174
Going away?

439
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,358
Will it be Greece...

440
00:38:59,497 --> 00:39:00,880
or Spain?

441
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,137
Maybe just good old Sweden?

442
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,516
We'll go into the other room.

443
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:19,583
No...

444
00:39:20,556 --> 00:39:22,392
I have to go home now.

445
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,560
It's nice to see you again.

446
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:05,740
After all, a brother's
still a brother...

447
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,112
even if he's older.

448
00:40:09,437 --> 00:40:11,672
Though we don't often
see each other.

449
00:40:12,488 --> 00:40:15,532
You haven't seemed interested,
though...

450
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:16,950
You know what I mean.

451
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,508
Yes, I understand.

452
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,442
So here you are, resting up.

453
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:25,110
Seems a good idea.

454
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:28,692
Though I don't really understand,
following what...

455
00:40:29,524 --> 00:40:32,204
or for what, either.

456
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,911
But you'll probably
get started again.

457
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:39,790
Though it was quite
a long time ago now.

458
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:46,524
Actually, you never gave
the least hint as to why you quit.

459
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,583
Had it involved atoms or genes
I might have guessed...

460
00:40:53,227 --> 00:40:54,571
But history!

461
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,711
But maybe even historians
can come up with dangerous truths.

462
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:09,271
Art, the humanities and religion
can start to resemble a hobby...

463
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:12,309
while everyone's going
in other directions...

464
00:41:13,284 --> 00:41:15,120
I understand that you...

465
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,069
You see?

466
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:19,702
Now I'm offering an explanation.

467
00:41:20,383 --> 00:41:22,930
Or I'm giving myself
an explanation.

468
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,617
It's really beautiful here.

469
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,926
The park is splendid.

470
00:41:34,379 --> 00:41:36,504
Must be difficult
keeping it looking so regal.

471
00:41:37,977 --> 00:41:42,801
But parks that are too orderly,
can be a bit frightening.

472
00:41:44,074 --> 00:41:48,402
As being symbolic
of power over society...

473
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,473
...a secret, inaccessible influence.

474
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,969
Like certain people.

475
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:59,950
Do you never get a feeling
about some people who are near...

476
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,168
that they have a secretive influence
that is out of your reach?

477
00:42:10,663 --> 00:42:12,531
Sometimes I feel that
about you, Aina.

478
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,972
That doesn't mean
I feel near to you...

479
00:42:16,511 --> 00:42:19,082
But Per-Hugo could get
that feeling from you.

480
00:42:20,953 --> 00:42:23,254
But you may not have heard
what I said?

481
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,752
Near...

482
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:34,107
What does "near" mean?
What does it mean to be near?

483
00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:39,045
I never know if you're present
or absent, Per-Hugo.

484
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,303
Whichever you are,
it's to the highest degree.

485
00:42:44,532 --> 00:42:48,857
Either totally present,
or alternatively, totally absent.

486
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,639
I don't know which.

487
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,596
It's if there were
a strict order there...

488
00:42:59,275 --> 00:43:01,932
to keep your presence
within reasonable limits.

489
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,283
As if we kept life and each other
at a distance, using our habits...

490
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,877
...ceremonies and rites.

491
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,002
Are you cold?

492
00:43:29,796 --> 00:43:31,701
Let's move on.

493
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:37,182
If we listen to psychologists,
and behavioural-researchers...

494
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,520
family counselors
and magazine writers...

495
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,260
you can get the idea
that life itself is a disease.

496
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,990
That a kind of
unattainable normality...

497
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,840
is the only healthy condition.

498
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:02,580
But normality is defined differently
from month to month...

499
00:44:04,278 --> 00:44:08,635
and we all keep readjusting
until we're wiped out.

500
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,574
You're smiling.

501
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:18,088
Maybe you think
we're already wiped out.

502
00:44:19,072 --> 00:44:21,400
You probably think
that's a pleasant thought.

503
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:24,990
If you have any thoughts.

504
00:44:26,786 --> 00:44:31,044
Or is it obvious to you
that life is a sickness?

505
00:44:32,794 --> 00:44:36,169
If so, will you destroy
all your ceremonies and rites?

506
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,883
It's pointless to get involved in
your "life", or whatever you call it.

507
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,962
You've selected or opted out,
or whatever it is.

508
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,794
There's a hint of children
still in your face.

509
00:44:56,179 --> 00:44:57,921
A hint of teachers.

510
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,155
Prominent professor of history.

511
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:06,843
Where have you done all this?

512
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,202
Can't you speak?

513
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:17,019
Are you ruled by a crazy chaos...

514
00:45:18,033 --> 00:45:20,103
or a crazy discipline?

515
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,619
How long can you
keep chaos going?

516
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,173
I don't understand.

517
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:34,806
What don't you?

518
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,462
I don't understand why you'd come
to ME with your concerns.

519
00:45:54,532 --> 00:45:56,798
"TO BE, OR..."
Professor Orr lectures

520
00:45:57,601 --> 00:46:02,759
In Sweden, the seat of this envy,
we have strict laws.

521
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,615
What is ill-matched
is disturbing.

522
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:07,994
Everything must have
human proportions.

523
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,447
That's why the weekly magazines
are full of Nobel laureates' recipes...

524
00:46:15,062 --> 00:46:18,134
and film-stars' solutions
to life-issues.

525
00:46:18,244 --> 00:46:20,470
Doctors' accounts of sail-boats...

526
00:46:20,587 --> 00:46:23,869
and our fashion designers'
confessions about their illnesses.

527
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,048
The most striking thing
is to be as ordinary as possible.

528
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,339
The absolutely most ordinary,
is his majesty the king...

529
00:46:36,389 --> 00:46:40,220
so that we can't find a reason
to abolish the monarchy.

530
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,806
I know I have wrapped myself
in this country's comfort blanket...

531
00:46:49,126 --> 00:46:53,423
where you still complain
so your critical mind is not blunted.

532
00:46:53,892 --> 00:46:59,470
I am a devoted complainer
about the climate and the government.

533
00:46:59,952 --> 00:47:04,048
I vote for the Social Democrats
and spend half my holidays in Sweden.

534
00:47:04,841 --> 00:47:08,416
I became politically aware
at an early age...

535
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:11,532
But I don't spend too much time
thinking about Czechs or Negroes.

536
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,001
I'm one of those well-meaning liberals
who corrupted the labour movement.

537
00:47:19,717 --> 00:47:25,697
I was too late in taking a conservative-
standpoint role in advancing progress...

538
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,931
to demonstrate what
should be swept away.

539
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,638
In my well-adapted
revolutionary zeal...

540
00:47:35,442 --> 00:47:38,560
which resulted in
the "du" usage reform...

541
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,784
and in an equal division
of responsibilities...

542
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:46,278
in the case of home purchases.

543
00:47:47,248 --> 00:47:49,474
In this, my revolutionary "you",

544
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:54,153
I've cleared the way for a useful
and pleasant paternal revolution.

545
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:59,224
When things become
too quiet and boring...

546
00:47:59,274 --> 00:48:01,138
on can offset the deeds
of one's opponents

547
00:48:01,216 --> 00:48:03,630
by introducing reforms...

548
00:48:04,044 --> 00:48:06,606
by releasing a bit
of influence in the workplace.

549
00:48:06,841 --> 00:48:11,513
This month it could be
an arms factory or a university.

550
00:48:11,935 --> 00:48:13,435
Doesn't matter at all.

551
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,099
Animals and history
have given me perspective.

552
00:48:24,216 --> 00:48:27,724
If I get stuck, I go to Skansen
or at the library.

553
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:29,395
Now I'm at Skansen.

554
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,606
The monkeys can sometimes be felt
as a kind of clarification.

555
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,704
Here they are singles
in a group.

556
00:48:43,903 --> 00:48:46,255
Does that clarify Karl-Henrik?

557
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,169
Loneliness as a group movement
in time.

558
00:48:52,955 --> 00:48:55,260
Isn't that interesting?

559
00:48:55,611 --> 00:48:57,111
I don't know.

560
00:48:57,557 --> 00:49:00,475
- You're so vague!
- I'm not alone in that.

561
00:49:01,642 --> 00:49:02,729
Do you mean me?

562
00:49:03,082 --> 00:49:06,207
I see it as a movement in time.

563
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,097
The monkeys and the seals
are the most expressive.

564
00:49:12,313 --> 00:49:14,240
It's almost scary!

565
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,254
They don't scare me until
you ask if I resemble them.

566
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,986
Don't you feel superior
to the animals now?

567
00:49:21,772 --> 00:49:23,408
So I didn't before?!

568
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,642
He scribbles down
his pathetic jam-jar rebellion...

569
00:49:33,424 --> 00:49:35,633
and the protest is expressed

570
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:39,187
by being silent towards someone
at the breakfast table.

571
00:49:40,795 --> 00:49:47,187
How could that person know of
the huge concerns swirling in his mind

572
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,965
before storming off to his
bureaucratic reform activities?

573
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,765
should one be ashamed
of being a bureaucrat...

574
00:49:56,981 --> 00:50:00,809
...when nowadays people brag
about their masturbating?

575
00:50:02,543 --> 00:50:05,746
Once upon a time, people might
restrict such things to their diaries.

576
00:50:05,887 --> 00:50:09,457
Nowadays they open up
to the lady sharing their table.

577
00:50:10,192 --> 00:50:15,426
She is amazes but flattered
by the casual way he tells her.

578
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,508
Am I talking about masturbation
or bureaucracy?

579
00:50:21,957 --> 00:50:23,470
You could say
it's the same thing...

580
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,614
I don't know
if there's something to it.

581
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:27,825
Masturbation...

582
00:50:28,364 --> 00:50:29,626
bureaucracy...

583
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:33,028
Two ways to keep chaos
under control.

584
00:50:33,794 --> 00:50:34,825
However...

585
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,717
I hate that kind of analogy.

586
00:50:38,262 --> 00:50:42,106
You must be allowed to masturbate
without thinking about paperwork!

587
00:50:46,847 --> 00:50:48,449
My name's Hanna.

588
00:50:49,153 --> 00:50:50,754
My name's Karl-Henrik.

589
00:50:51,973 --> 00:50:53,934
What do you actually
going to do?

590
00:50:54,243 --> 00:50:56,371
- About...?
- What's the catch?

591
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,409
It's free admission.

592
00:50:58,707 --> 00:51:01,145
Does that mean more people
come to listen?

593
00:51:14,567 --> 00:51:18,418
If the uprising only touches
your own personal freedom...

594
00:51:19,652 --> 00:51:21,258
...don't worry about chaos.

595
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:24,652
Go around for a bit,
making waves...

596
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:28,441
and then end up in a spiffy
but undemanding space...

597
00:51:28,535 --> 00:51:29,730
your own and others'.

598
00:51:31,231 --> 00:51:33,227
Everything possible
has been tried.

599
00:51:33,277 --> 00:51:36,605
It's not so easy now that Social
Democrats are not Social Democrats...

600
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:43,160
and we see that Mao wasn't a Maoist,
and Zen was no Buddhist.

601
00:51:46,927 --> 00:51:50,401
Have you found a hook
to hang your soul on?

602
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,845
You know, that strange
lonely thing

603
00:51:53,895 --> 00:51:56,934
that slips out at night and
comes back in the morning.

604
00:51:58,721 --> 00:52:01,129
To what? I'll probably find out.

605
00:52:01,943 --> 00:52:04,232
But from what?
That I won't find out.

606
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,067
I try for a while...

607
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,443
but...

608
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:14,943
content myself with being
a bit drowsy when I'm writing.

609
00:52:15,084 --> 00:52:16,997
The usual thing...

610
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,318
At 6.30 in the morning
there are many hands...

611
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:22,405
in our Swedish villages...

612
00:52:22,455 --> 00:52:24,455
used to working at anything.

613
00:52:27,331 --> 00:52:29,765
People work their arses off...

614
00:52:29,815 --> 00:52:33,583
so subtle thinking evaporates

615
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:38,551
Then comes the banal charge
of trivialities.

616
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,872
Everyday poetry
fills you with its sadness.

617
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:48,699
Nothing would be more out of place
than if you uttered a morning prayer.

618
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,075
Anyway, nobody does it.

619
00:52:51,653 --> 00:52:53,165
Instead, we get a big burp.

620
00:52:53,852 --> 00:52:57,274
One of those, often long-
awaited in small babies.

621
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,981
Then there's the fart.

622
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:04,152
The day begins with air leaving you.

623
00:53:24,725 --> 00:53:27,147
It can befall anyone.

624
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:31,256
Isn't "befall" a bit much?

625
00:53:31,357 --> 00:53:33,014
Why do you do this, then?

626
00:53:33,095 --> 00:53:34,521
Personal reasons.

627
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,990
Communication with my
nearest and dearest.

628
00:53:38,156 --> 00:53:39,891
That's very odd.

629
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:42,006
It's an artistic creation.

630
00:53:42,217 --> 00:53:44,811
You use humanity as a mailbox.

631
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,639
Too bad there are so few
representatives of humanity here.

632
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,899
Hi, Karl-Henrik.

633
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,480
This is Anna-Berit at 'Just Then'.

634
00:54:31,698 --> 00:54:33,136
How are you going?

635
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:34,956
Fine, thanks.

636
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,776
I saw in a local paper
that you're out on a lecture tour.

637
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,245
It seems to be related
to our series of articles.

638
00:54:43,425 --> 00:54:44,753
The new one.

639
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,329
Can I just say
what I rang to say?

640
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,917
We've no one to send just now,
and I'm up to my ears...

641
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:55,605
just so much to do
on this right now.

642
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,118
Can you send us a clean copy?

643
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,116
Don't you have a clean copy?

644
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:06,335
You must realise that we journalists
hate the bad habit of speaking freely!

645
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,105
That was a joke, Karl-Henrik.

646
00:55:09,642 --> 00:55:12,915
Can you give me a summary
on the phone?

647
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,494
Why not?

648
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:19,612
So, it can't be summarised?

649
00:55:19,662 --> 00:55:21,150
You always say that.

650
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,759
We'll try anyway.

651
00:55:24,328 --> 00:55:29,164
If there were some connection,
won't it be good for publicity?

652
00:55:29,355 --> 00:55:30,990
Where are you next time?

653
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,771
Have you closed down
your lecture business?

654
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,185
Damn, things get stuck sometimes!

655
00:55:39,209 --> 00:55:42,795
I'm sorry, but you could
have given me a hint.

656
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,459
Don't take what I say
so seriously.

657
00:55:48,209 --> 00:55:49,709
I'm a bit desperate.

658
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:52,349
We haven't got what
we had in mind, out of it.

659
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,119
I may try a symposium.

660
00:55:55,584 --> 00:55:57,013
You'd be supportive wouldn't you?

661
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,193
Why would you sit backwards?

662
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:04,232
No, no public.
It's just you and me...

663
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,482
the editor-in-chief
and some other single people.

664
00:56:09,353 --> 00:56:11,146
Of course I can't force you.

665
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:14,818
I could of course try with May.

666
00:56:15,224 --> 00:56:19,310
But you're more fun...
and a little more famous.

667
00:56:20,087 --> 00:56:22,463
We've given up on anonymity.

668
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:25,453
It works better
with known material.

669
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,838
We have big problems
with circulation.

670
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:30,400
We have to broaden our appeal.

671
00:56:30,551 --> 00:56:33,814
The broader we get,
the fewer the people get.

672
00:56:33,864 --> 00:56:35,602
Know what I mean?

673
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,246
Then I worked in the theatre.

674
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:46,378
Everybody there
was nice to each other.

675
00:56:46,558 --> 00:56:49,303
They were always kissing and hugging

676
00:56:49,353 --> 00:56:52,417
and asking how you were
and what you were doing...

677
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,351
But they never waited
for an answer.

678
00:56:55,527 --> 00:56:59,293
If you did get a chance to answer,
they didn't hear it.

679
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,652
They talked about
what a hard time they'd had...

680
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:05,440
with the role...
with the director...

681
00:57:06,207 --> 00:57:09,402
or finding time for things nobody
had told them to find time for.

682
00:57:09,855 --> 00:57:12,152
On radio, TV, in the theater,

683
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,894
sing in bars,
read at congresses...

684
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,777
It was always too much
...or too little.

685
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,793
Lots of cute boys.

686
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,906
I thought I'd try journalism.

687
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,513
It really is something
I want to know about.

688
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,932
And so I ended up here...

689
00:57:32,472 --> 00:57:33,796
and happened upon you...

690
00:57:34,144 --> 00:57:35,760
a regular theatre daddy.

691
00:57:37,456 --> 00:57:39,089
And then I get mad at you.

692
00:57:40,084 --> 00:57:42,624
In actual fact,
I can't really write...

693
00:57:42,925 --> 00:57:45,018
so I'll never really make it
as a journalist.

694
00:57:45,683 --> 00:57:47,421
Now I'm talking too much.

695
00:57:47,762 --> 00:57:49,402
Let's be silent for a bit.

696
00:57:53,432 --> 00:57:55,220
"A professor", I was thinking...

697
00:57:55,434 --> 00:58:00,232
"who talks about whether to be,
is something for me."

698
00:58:00,606 --> 00:58:02,243
"It's just what I need."

699
00:58:03,177 --> 00:58:05,224
It was just what
I did NOT need."

700
00:58:06,521 --> 00:58:10,529
Didn't you see something in me
that was something else I wanted?

701
00:58:11,469 --> 00:58:13,236
Don't I mean anything
at all to you?

702
00:58:14,993 --> 00:58:17,829
I'm asking you if
I mean anything to you.

703
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,763
No, I might've guessed.

704
00:58:23,486 --> 00:58:24,751
It depends on...

705
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,572
What "mean anything?" signifies?

706
00:58:26,626 --> 00:58:28,760
It doesn't, at all.

707
00:58:31,635 --> 00:58:33,221
It's really delightful here.

708
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,224
Yes, but it doesn't
need you to say it.

709
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,986
Just let me be the way I am.

710
00:58:40,782 --> 00:58:43,540
Why? Then there's no point
in being together.

711
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:45,619
Being together?

712
00:58:45,968 --> 00:58:48,273
I realise it sounds a bit much.

713
00:58:49,398 --> 00:58:52,749
You and I... we're together
without being together.

714
00:58:52,846 --> 00:58:54,030
Know why?

715
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,205
Don't laugh...
It's not funny.

716
00:58:56,539 --> 00:58:57,617
No?

717
00:58:58,508 --> 00:59:00,508
Not much can be done about it.

718
00:59:02,047 --> 00:59:03,668
No, there isn't.

719
00:59:05,565 --> 00:59:07,916
Hello! Where have you
gone off to?

720
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,729
We can discuss it, can't we?

721
00:59:20,929 --> 00:59:24,408
You say it's delightful here,
and I totally agree.

722
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:28,168
It goes awry, in my experience.

723
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:30,314
I thought I was
a new experience?

724
00:59:30,486 --> 00:59:32,486
Perhaps you're a bit
too pretentious for that.

725
00:59:33,034 --> 00:59:34,983
Good Lord! You're right!

726
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:37,979
It's terrible that I don't
grab that opportunity.

727
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,564
You're deceptive, you know.

728
00:59:40,955 --> 00:59:42,525
I'm not a bit deceptive.

729
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:47,189
I've tried to deceive myself,
but normality gets in the way.

730
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:50,055
Look at my ridiculous attempts.

731
00:59:51,269 --> 00:59:53,771
Can't you smash me
into little pieces

732
00:59:53,821 --> 00:59:56,696
and we'll try to put the bits back
together in a different way?

733
00:59:56,777 --> 00:59:58,185
I could never do that.

734
00:59:59,537 --> 01:00:01,053
No, you couldn't.

735
01:00:02,049 --> 01:00:03,877
But you're there nosing around.

736
01:00:04,553 --> 01:00:06,506
Though you don't mean
anything by it.

737
01:00:07,115 --> 01:00:08,684
What's THAT about?

738
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:11,967
- I don't think I'm nosy!
- Leave me alone!

739
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:14,140
You said I've nothing
to give you.

740
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:16,799
In your ridiculous lectures, no.

741
01:00:17,978 --> 01:00:20,354
Then it's as if there
was nothing to do.

742
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:22,346
I get scared...

743
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,519
I don't want to
become like that.

744
01:00:26,808 --> 01:00:30,463
I'm surrounded by everything
that I don't want to be like.

745
01:00:32,697 --> 01:00:36,377
I'll give a stupid lecture,
so that you understand.

746
01:00:37,095 --> 01:00:38,878
There's a lot to grasp.

747
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:41,835
Yes, I'm scared.

748
01:00:42,865 --> 01:00:44,240
I'm afraid of the old...

749
01:00:44,303 --> 01:00:49,287
of children, of animals, drug addicts,
police, superiors, subordinates...

750
01:00:49,352 --> 01:00:52,312
Don't you see you insult
them all by fearing them?

751
01:00:52,456 --> 01:00:55,115
I'm afraid of sleeping,
I'm afraid of waking up.

752
01:00:55,225 --> 01:00:58,401
I'm afraid of insiders,
I'm afraid of the tossed out...

753
01:00:58,486 --> 01:01:00,262
I'm afraid of Negroes.

754
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,450
I'm afraid of waitresses,
head waiters, caretakers.

755
01:01:04,042 --> 01:01:08,715
I'm afraid of farmers, chimney sweeps,
murderers, priests, thieves...

756
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,399
tax experts and fortune tellers.

757
01:01:12,888 --> 01:01:14,849
I'm afraid of the cold,
of the sea.

758
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,536
I'm afraid of dogs and cats,
and the mentally defective.

759
01:01:18,614 --> 01:01:21,262
- I'm afraid of cars.
- I understand!

760
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,923
You're very mean, you know.

761
01:01:26,986 --> 01:01:28,978
I'm not afraid of what's real...

762
01:01:29,893 --> 01:01:31,518
I'm afraid of what's NOT real.

763
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,267
All the way to Lisbon?

764
01:03:18,406 --> 01:03:19,914
Is he still in love with you?

765
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,847
Why can't you tidy up, yourself?

766
01:03:27,987 --> 01:03:29,710
I could but I don't want to.

767
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,151
I like it better
when it's untidy.

768
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,163
You like mess!

769
01:03:35,265 --> 01:03:37,128
Not really, but it's my mess.

770
01:03:37,308 --> 01:03:38,776
Well, it's not mine.

771
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,498
It's my room.

772
01:03:40,982 --> 01:03:43,326
In the home that we share.

773
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,654
You don't tidy to make it neat.

774
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,343
So why would I tidy then?

775
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:52,478
So you can scold people.

776
01:03:52,896 --> 01:03:55,193
It's bourgeois behaviour.

777
01:03:55,482 --> 01:03:57,169
Things replace people.

778
01:03:58,349 --> 01:04:01,208
I sometimes wonder
why I bother going on.

779
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,718
I just explained.

780
01:04:02,768 --> 01:04:04,920
It was not a good explanation.

781
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,247
Maybe it's because
you like me, Mum.

782
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,556
It IS because you like me!

783
01:04:14,983 --> 01:04:17,991
This feels like
emotional blackmail.

784
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,339
So I'm still keeping track
of you.

785
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:24,381
You're silly,
not leaving things alone.

786
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:28,881
I know I represent
something boring but necessary.

787
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,905
But maybe it's you
who's forced me to be that way.

788
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:37,272
No, I won't take the blame
for that.

789
01:04:46,468 --> 01:04:47,905
"Necessary"!...

790
01:04:48,405 --> 01:04:51,147
You have such strange ideas
about what is necessary.

791
01:04:51,981 --> 01:04:54,481
And yours... are what?

792
01:04:54,739 --> 01:04:58,114
Mummy... Crawl out
of your vending machine!

793
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:02,278
You put your quarter in and know
exactly what will spew out.

794
01:05:02,459 --> 01:05:05,276
Is your quarter new and shiny?

795
01:05:05,354 --> 01:05:08,346
It's what Dad calls a metaphor.

796
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,283
This is about cleaning?

797
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:13,042
No, it's about you
never talking to me.

798
01:05:13,205 --> 01:05:14,377
Nonsense.

799
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:17,201
You talk to me,
ABOUT me.

800
01:05:17,271 --> 01:05:18,818
I don't understand.

801
01:05:19,139 --> 01:05:20,599
No, you don't understand.

802
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:24,080
There is never anything of yourself
in what you say to me.

803
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,680
- You are so damned egocentric!
- It sounds like the opposite.

804
01:05:27,809 --> 01:05:30,857
You're too egocentric
to concern yourself about someone else.

805
01:05:33,724 --> 01:05:37,458
I don't know...
it's been hard to connect with you.

806
01:05:38,091 --> 01:05:39,560
What do you mean?

807
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,690
Something comes between us.

808
01:05:43,192 --> 01:05:46,739
It's like bits of the body
hit out.

809
01:05:47,594 --> 01:05:48,790
Is it me?

810
01:05:49,405 --> 01:05:50,835
Probably not.

811
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:54,686
I've noticed that...

812
01:05:55,475 --> 01:06:00,889
In our circles, people's bodies
disappear in their clothing.

813
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:03,601
They cease to exist.

814
01:06:04,343 --> 01:06:07,960
There's no longer anywhere
for them to make their mark.

815
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:13,009
You patch, fix and wash and
iron on weekends.

816
01:06:14,611 --> 01:06:16,017
And the shells...

817
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,685
Inside them...

818
01:06:20,197 --> 01:06:21,525
I don't know.

819
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,869
Why don't you scream?

820
01:06:25,141 --> 01:06:27,509
I do not know
if I have a voice left.

821
01:08:02,146 --> 01:08:05,134
When you look at this, Hanna...

822
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:11,017
...you wonder what was so tempting
to poor St Anthony

823
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:16,541
It seems to be all terror,
dread and horror.

824
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,251
Temptations...? Of course!

825
01:08:21,088 --> 01:08:23,728
Fear can also be a shelter
and a refuge.

826
01:08:24,727 --> 01:08:26,977
It becomes evil
to flee the world...

827
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,970
instead of making use of it,
or allowing oneself to be used.

828
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,591
St Anthony yielded
to the temptations.

829
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:37,773
A saint shouldn't do that,
should he?

830
01:08:39,498 --> 01:08:42,496
Did you say "The new thirst for saints"?

831
01:08:44,367 --> 01:08:45,913
Did you say Lisbon?

832
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,204
Strange headline,
strange place.

833
01:08:51,254 --> 01:08:52,773
Sure is.

834
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,573
A follow-up you said?

835
01:08:54,853 --> 01:08:56,267
Yes, maybe I said that.

836
01:08:56,337 --> 01:08:57,799
Yes, you did.

837
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,619
Of course, the magazine
has resources, but...

838
01:09:02,619 --> 01:09:05,947
"Lisbon and the new thirst
for saints"?

839
01:09:06,314 --> 01:09:07,564
Maybe it's nothing.

840
01:09:07,697 --> 01:09:09,001
Yes it is!

841
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:12,517
I don't want to discourage
a young and hungry researcher

842
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:18,236
but Lisbon is too much,
and thirst is too little.

843
01:09:18,423 --> 01:09:21,790
The range doesn't match
the specific gravity of the material.

844
01:09:21,947 --> 01:09:23,267
Obviously.

845
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:26,334
Do you have any
more local saints?

846
01:09:26,801 --> 01:09:29,083
They might arouse
a bit more thirst

847
01:09:29,294 --> 01:09:30,731
No, I don't.

848
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,173
Lisbon...

849
01:09:32,832 --> 01:09:35,336
If you'd said Vetlanda...

850
01:09:35,684 --> 01:09:38,371
Lisbon sounds too high-brow.

851
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,040
Let's drop the subject.

852
01:09:40,154 --> 01:09:43,326
Yes, well, you're here to learn.

853
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:46,782
A follow-up you said.

854
01:09:46,893 --> 01:09:50,142
Or, professor,
lectured on the subject.

855
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,395
We don't need to revisit that.

856
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:54,112
Well to sum up...

857
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,815
Conclusion:
It's not something for us.

858
01:11:11,924 --> 01:11:14,119
First, the freezing lake
disturbance...

859
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:15,736
then there was no job...

860
01:11:16,044 --> 01:11:17,640
and then I bump into you.

861
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:18,811
That was a pity.

862
01:11:18,862 --> 01:11:21,168
That I bumped into you
or missed out on a job?

863
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,974
Not even you can think
it was your fault.

864
01:11:25,419 --> 01:11:27,177
In that case,
I'll accept the blame.

865
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,407
I couldn't stay in Lisbon.

866
01:11:30,473 --> 01:11:31,704
Lisbon.

867
01:11:32,735 --> 01:11:34,525
Saint Anthony.

868
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:38,095
You react strongly
when you're contradicted.

869
01:11:38,145 --> 01:11:39,220
Do I?

870
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:41,747
I was a bit critical of your lecture.

871
01:11:42,286 --> 01:11:46,177
But you might become a saint,
if you get scared enough?

872
01:11:48,393 --> 01:11:49,654
Or was it so that...

873
01:11:49,742 --> 01:11:54,583
Anthony's fear drove him into
magnificent self-deception?

874
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,372
Fear as temptation?

875
01:11:57,742 --> 01:11:58,742
Well!

876
01:12:00,078 --> 01:12:03,727
I don't think you've delivered
any bigger fight with the demons.

877
01:12:06,137 --> 01:12:08,864
You think I'm nasty, trying
to improve what you say.

878
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,833
You're laundering St Anthony...

879
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,903
I'm trying to see that
you shrink in the wash.

880
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,016
I was in Lisbon.

881
01:13:09,589 --> 01:13:11,136
So May told me.

882
01:13:12,163 --> 01:13:13,426
So you know?

883
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,451
- Nothing came of it.
- So what happened?

884
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:23,192
It wasn't used.

885
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:29,721
Maybe it wasn't significant
singles behaviour.

886
01:13:30,795 --> 01:13:33,310
Didn't you hear it
from the German experts?

887
01:13:33,528 --> 01:13:36,799
We cancelled the series
after 2 episodes.

888
01:13:37,537 --> 01:13:39,091
Hard to get material?

889
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:42,306
No, single people
are easy to find.

890
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:44,941
Readers just weren't interested.

891
01:13:44,991 --> 01:13:46,448
It may be just the nature of it...

892
01:13:47,284 --> 01:13:49,745
not being turned on
by single people.

893
01:13:49,917 --> 01:13:51,666
Poor singles.

894
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,135
In Germany, they got a broad
and interesting debate started.

895
01:13:57,690 --> 01:13:58,917
What a shame...

896
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,033
What a shame you
had to drop the series.

897
01:14:05,946 --> 01:14:08,253
I am just a cancelled episode.

898
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,721
Very funny,
but it wasn't your fault.

899
01:14:13,856 --> 01:14:15,458
No, I went to Lisbon.

900
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,220
That wasn't your fault either.

901
01:14:19,364 --> 01:14:21,284
There are things that test us,
you know.

902
01:14:21,964 --> 01:14:23,970
But anyway,
it's quite irrelevant.

903
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:27,282
We have more stuff to run
than we have room for.

904
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,122
- And so...
-...we tossed out the singles.

905
01:14:30,665 --> 01:14:32,635
Is THAT what's eating you?

906
01:14:33,716 --> 01:14:38,059
You want to be a little pathetic
and offended and felt sorry for.

907
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,096
- You've misunderstood it!
- How tiresome!

908
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:44,226
It's not about
what's fun or boring...

909
01:14:44,276 --> 01:14:46,566
it's about a whole new
social attitude.

910
01:14:46,616 --> 01:14:47,956
What fun!

911
01:14:54,221 --> 01:14:55,967
You do not live
with your husband?

912
01:14:56,137 --> 01:14:59,137
No. We find it stimulating.

913
01:14:59,723 --> 01:15:04,000
There was an earthquake
in Lisbon in 1755.

914
01:15:04,342 --> 01:15:07,280
Was there?
The Lisbon earthquake.

915
01:15:07,479 --> 01:15:09,862
Yes, there was
a Lisbon earthquake.

916
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:11,546
It's listed under 'C'.

917
01:15:11,596 --> 01:15:13,890
- 'C'?
- Catastrophes.

918
01:15:14,104 --> 01:15:16,100
Could be usable some time.

919
01:15:16,151 --> 01:15:17,167
Listen!

920
01:15:17,217 --> 01:15:20,397
You have a lot to do...
things have to go to press...

921
01:15:20,464 --> 01:15:21,998
And hopefully "Sorry"... but...

922
01:15:23,161 --> 01:15:25,365
But I'm actually not
going to leave yet.

923
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,264
You really can do that!

924
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,880
- Enough of that!
- Is it disturbing?

925
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:11,708
I barely made out at all
before I graduated.

926
01:16:12,022 --> 01:16:14,710
I was just pinned in a box.

927
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,912
Are you saying
you were a butterfly?

928
01:16:16,962 --> 01:16:18,525
Then forgotten and rejected.

929
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:20,068
Written off as uninteresting.

930
01:16:20,693 --> 01:16:23,268
Were there too few or too many?

931
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:25,385
You probably counted
on on too few.

932
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,605
Damn!

933
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,202
First, you don't want
to go along,

934
01:16:30,617 --> 01:16:33,802
but when it's cancelled,
you feel offended!

935
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,634
You want to draw attention
to the fact

936
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:41,688
that you want to be left alone.

937
01:16:41,739 --> 01:16:43,349
Even your silence
should be interesting!

938
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,818
Then we get hell
because it was cut short.

939
01:16:47,715 --> 01:16:50,688
"You did not get out anymore?"

940
01:16:51,591 --> 01:16:55,693
Even your silence
should be interesting!

941
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,036
"Professor Orr sits quietly."
That has significance.

942
01:17:00,426 --> 01:17:02,763
"Professor Orr doesn't answer."

943
01:17:04,426 --> 01:17:09,880
Then we'll come with a nice,
impressionist, personal description...

944
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:13,213
which you contradicted
and wanted changed

945
01:17:13,263 --> 01:17:15,800
in a written complaint
to the editor-in-chief.

946
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,483
Button up your fucking shirt!

947
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:20,219
I don't want to button my shirt!

948
01:17:21,002 --> 01:17:22,731
I'm your fucking material!

949
01:17:22,984 --> 01:17:25,804
I don't give a shit whether
it bothers you or not!

950
01:17:25,898 --> 01:17:27,281
Well, take it off!

951
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,538
Take it off instead of fumbling
with those stupid buttons!

952
01:17:31,607 --> 01:17:33,572
Is that supposed to shock?

953
01:17:33,669 --> 01:17:35,005
Don't you ever go to the movies?

954
01:17:35,056 --> 01:17:35,746
Movies?

955
01:17:35,796 --> 01:17:38,108
It's not the 19th century

956
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:41,130
and I can cope without screaming,
seeing a naked man!

957
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,629
I don't think that
you ARE coping...

958
01:17:52,570 --> 01:17:54,911
I really think it bothers you.

959
01:17:55,489 --> 01:17:56,765
It bothers you...

960
01:17:56,827 --> 01:18:01,960
that you cope with it so utterly,
all the way to hell.

961
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,433
Poor little Anna-Berit!

962
01:18:11,749 --> 01:18:14,538
She has to cope everything
and still have pathos.

963
01:18:15,593 --> 01:18:18,105
She must understand everything,
have opinions.

964
01:18:18,449 --> 01:18:20,630
I don't need this lecture!

965
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,750
No, no...

966
01:18:23,755 --> 01:18:25,614
But maybe I need it.

967
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,884
Do you stand by that thing?

968
01:18:30,303 --> 01:18:31,573
Yes, you do...

969
01:18:31,866 --> 01:18:33,225
As well as you can.

970
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:36,184
Is that all you have to bring?

971
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,512
It can be due to me too.

972
01:18:44,207 --> 01:18:46,545
It can be due to me too...

973
01:18:57,311 --> 01:18:59,364
I'll retire to the corner
of the ring.

974
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,957
You're changing the topic.

975
01:19:30,254 --> 01:19:31,527
"That wasn't any good."

976
01:19:31,765 --> 01:19:33,120
I'm not changing the topic.

977
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,780
Perhaps there was nothing wrong
with the topic you had.

978
01:19:36,634 --> 01:19:38,659
You're like a nagging child.

979
01:19:40,393 --> 01:19:42,567
You have to try
every different way.

980
01:19:43,187 --> 01:19:45,300
Can't you button up
your shirt now?

981
01:19:47,467 --> 01:19:49,067
I'd love to go home.

982
01:19:51,668 --> 01:19:53,737
I've a terrible desire
to go home.

983
01:19:53,787 --> 01:19:55,104
So go home.

984
01:19:55,928 --> 01:19:57,510
The project is cancelled.

985
01:19:58,946 --> 01:20:00,248
You took hold of me...

986
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,025
baptised me...

987
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:05,989
took me out of my social context,
wrote about me and threw me away.

988
01:20:06,107 --> 01:20:08,825
I presume you are talking to me.

989
01:20:09,146 --> 01:20:10,918
It's ME you're talking about.

990
01:20:15,842 --> 01:20:18,810
Lucky that you found me
to hang your misery on.

991
01:20:20,473 --> 01:20:22,879
Your stately exit from home

992
01:20:22,929 --> 01:20:25,621
might well have been planned
by the editorial office!

993
01:20:26,769 --> 01:20:29,803
If that stateliness is difficult
to maintain...

994
01:20:29,853 --> 01:20:31,692
then it's because I write badly.

995
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:37,043
What would it be like,
if you finally realised...

996
01:20:37,157 --> 01:20:39,746
that you are totally
in your own hands?

997
01:20:40,683 --> 01:20:42,063
The single man...

998
01:20:42,278 --> 01:20:44,129
Nothing for the family side.

999
01:20:45,202 --> 01:20:47,809
Not just YOU,
not just now.

1000
01:20:48,199 --> 01:20:49,771
Not just THEN.

1001
01:20:49,848 --> 01:20:51,012
Nope.

1002
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:53,627
And nothing for the future either.

1003
01:20:54,921 --> 01:20:56,426
Are you asking?

1004
01:20:56,995 --> 01:20:58,223
Don't know.

1005
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,853
No. The Professor doesn't ask.

1006
01:21:00,903 --> 01:21:03,762
He doesn't know
if he's asking or stating.

1007
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:06,637
That's what you keep
well apart in journalism.

1008
01:21:12,229 --> 01:21:14,418
So, it's the alcoholics again?

1009
01:21:15,707 --> 01:21:17,801
Good, as long as
they hold on for you.

1010
01:21:20,098 --> 01:21:23,330
So what have you got for when
you've solved the alcohol question?

1011
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:25,931
Was there anything more?

1012
01:21:26,626 --> 01:21:28,595
In my own hands, you said.

1013
01:21:29,283 --> 01:21:30,845
That's probably right.

1014
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:32,786
Yes.

1015
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,928
In his own hands.

1016
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,241
A headline.

1017
01:21:40,405 --> 01:21:43,403
You anti-socialise
and finish up believing...

1018
01:21:43,453 --> 01:21:47,150
that you should find
a new identity.

1019
01:21:48,991 --> 01:21:52,218
In the end, you don't have strength
enough to even pose for yourself.

1020
01:21:53,931 --> 01:21:55,593
Then you are really alone.

1021
01:21:57,194 --> 01:21:59,776
We're doing a series about
new religious revivals.

1022
01:21:59,921 --> 01:22:01,906
It's underway now.

1023
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,164
I'll read it.

1024
01:22:08,353 --> 01:22:10,395
I never stood in the "corner
of shame" as a child.

1025
01:22:11,104 --> 01:22:12,713
It was well abolished then.

1026
01:22:13,834 --> 01:22:15,423
The corner itself, yes.

1027
01:22:20,144 --> 01:22:21,814
Could you love me?

1028
01:22:22,697 --> 01:22:24,423
That came without warning!

1029
01:22:24,518 --> 01:22:25,744
Not really.

1030
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,229
Could you love me?

1031
01:22:29,214 --> 01:22:30,824
Yes, very likely.

1032
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:33,009
That was a nice way
of putting it.

1033
01:22:33,182 --> 01:22:35,509
You probably don't understand
what I'm referring to.

1034
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,794
You're just thinking about
the connotation of a couple.

1035
01:22:38,184 --> 01:22:39,658
No I'm not.

1036
01:22:40,611 --> 01:22:44,719
You've written about
the extended family as well.

1037
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:47,746
It was a big and positive job.

1038
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,945
You live alone...
You say it's stimulating?

1039
01:22:52,142 --> 01:22:53,845
Yes, but in summer, then...

1040
01:22:53,934 --> 01:22:56,541
Yes, the time of year
will come into it.

1041
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,922
'Bye then.

1042
01:23:06,075 --> 01:23:07,075
Goodbye.

1043
01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:21,556
Maybe we shouldn't
imagine anything...

1044
01:23:22,394 --> 01:23:24,173
Neither of us.

1045
01:23:27,026 --> 01:23:28,828
That's pretty much
what I was thinking.

1046
01:23:29,911 --> 01:23:31,114
So, then...?

1047
01:23:32,339 --> 01:23:33,834
Bye bye, single person.

1048
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:36,400
- What do you mean?
- See you, single!

1049
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,612
Is THIS the way
you intend to escape?

1050
01:23:39,752 --> 01:23:41,996
Does one escape being single?

1051
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:44,482
- You'll always escape.
- What about here?

1052
01:23:44,841 --> 01:23:48,991
This lair for perspective and reason
with a dash of personality...

1053
01:23:49,138 --> 01:23:52,001
I feel like tearing it all apart!

1054
01:23:52,051 --> 01:23:53,724
Well go and do it
in your own home!

1055
01:23:53,775 --> 01:23:55,275
You were longing for home,
you said.

1056
01:23:55,326 --> 01:23:58,255
What about your series
on "the knick-knack society", then?

1057
01:23:59,255 --> 01:24:04,356
Did you unpack all this mess
and breed more for your research?

1058
01:24:07,513 --> 01:24:10,083
I can leave that there
as long as I want!

01:24:10,683 --> 01:24:14,076
Racing home to hubby
mightn’t be so stimulating, but...

1060
01:24:15,942 --> 01:24:17,470
That belongs to me!

1061
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:20,645
You can put on an act
with your own crockery.

1062
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,404
I don't dare.

1063
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,881
Anybody home?

1064
01:26:19,026 --> 01:26:21,905
- Home in the middle of the day?
- I've a free afternoon.

1065
01:26:38,534 --> 01:26:39,561
Ellen?

1066
01:26:39,612 --> 01:26:43,120
She's in Agadir with friends.

1067
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,061
I'm worried there may be boys.

1068
01:26:45,341 --> 01:26:46,399
Probably.

1069
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:48,802
It's so easy to travel
these days.

1070
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:52,376
Maybe it's some kind of liberation.

1071
01:26:56,897 --> 01:26:57,967
Yeah.
