2
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:33,783
I've never
been off the island, John.

3
00:01:33,816 --> 00:01:35,318
Neither has your imagination.

4
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:38,322
Stop.

5
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:08,853
Where would you travel?

6
00:02:10,854 --> 00:02:12,390
Boston.

7
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:17,728
No, I mean, if you could go
to South America or Europe?

8
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:20,965
Boston.

9
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:24,669
Really?

10
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,486
What is it?

11
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:45,423
I'm hungry.

12
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:46,823
You've no more money.

13
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:48,592
Ah.

14
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:34,437
Are you looking for someone?

15
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:37,608
I need a room.
Just for a week or two.

16
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,075
Do you have
family on the island?

17
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:40,444
I do not.

18
00:03:40,477 --> 00:03:41,846
I'll take you for a night.

19
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:43,847
After that, you're on your own.

20
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:46,783
There's rooms out by the
five corners. Guinea town.

21
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:10,508
Sh.

22
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,848
Jake.

23
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:20,818
What brings you here?

24
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,886
The war.

25
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:26,591
You tell him.

26
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:41,137
Tell him what you need.

27
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,574
His doctor stopped giving him
medicine.

28
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:45,709
Is your leg still hurting?

29
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:48,579
Just give us opium,
doctor. I beg you.

30
00:04:48,612 --> 00:04:50,781
I only wish to know the
man's condition, good woman.

31
00:04:50,814 --> 00:04:52,817
Give him what he needs,

32
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:55,752
or I won't stay with him.

33
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,089
Not another night.

34
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:09,434
This is the last
of what I've got.

35
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,670
I want to see him back
here if he needs help.

36
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:15,472
Way I hear it, you're about
to pull up stakes anyways.

37
00:05:15,505 --> 00:05:17,507
Only to another part of town.

38
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,043
Here.

39
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,521
Good morning, Mrs. Rivers.

40
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,273
What you
doing holding a chicken?

41
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:50,841
Rent.

42
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:53,576
Although, my landlord
apparently prefers pork.

43
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,912
I'm getting evicted.

44
00:05:54,944 --> 00:05:56,514
Where will you go?

45
00:05:56,547 --> 00:05:57,648
You need your chemist.

46
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,216
I gave away the
last of that opium.

47
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:00,918
You still owe me for it.

48
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:03,254
Well, first I need
to find a new office.

49
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:06,189
What are you
gonna do with that chicken?

50
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:09,793
Make a good soup.

51
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:40,757
I beg your pardon.

52
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,860
Uh, Mrs. Roland?

53
00:06:43,894 --> 00:06:45,062
Yes?

54
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:48,632
Don't make me guess.

55
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:50,968
I'm looking for
a Dr. Peter Roland.

56
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,603
Ah. Why?

57
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:54,805
Are you unwell?

58
00:06:54,838 --> 00:06:58,175
My husband was a captain in
the war. They crossed paths.

59
00:06:59,343 --> 00:07:00,545
A captain?

60
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:04,115
Well, Peter doesn't
talk much about the war.

61
00:07:04,648 --> 00:07:06,183
Is he expecting you?

62
00:07:06,216 --> 00:07:09,653
No, but I have
traveled a long way.

63
00:07:10,153 --> 00:07:11,556
Mm.

64
00:07:20,697 --> 00:07:22,867
Women delay
the start of everything.

65
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:27,004
Not very polite to our
visitor.

66
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:29,138
Oh. Apologies all around.

67
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:31,108
Now can we simply get in the
boat?

68
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:34,010
Oh yes, I would like to
introduce you.

69
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:35,346
We'll make
our introductions later.

70
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:38,115
After we've tried to at
least catch a single fish.

71
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,260
Work here can be
dreadfully dull for a woman.

72
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:53,631
Unless you like dipping
candles or cleaning fish.

73
00:07:53,663 --> 00:07:54,899
Quiet.

74
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,235
All right, watch this.

75
00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:05,175
Christ.

76
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,176
Charles.

77
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:08,079
They don't bite at all.

78
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:11,247
Only men should go fishing.

79
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:13,083
Father, please.

80
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:15,853
Without even a bite in
two hours, why bother?

81
00:08:16,386 --> 00:08:19,723
The lazy brutes have taken
their siestas in the sun.

82
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:21,724
Well, you've had plenty of
good sport.

83
00:08:21,757 --> 00:08:23,159
How many did he hook?

84
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:24,862
Four.

85
00:08:24,894 --> 00:08:28,665
A silver heap of clammy
scales and struggling fins

86
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:30,835
breathing in the fatal air.

87
00:08:35,772 --> 00:08:37,642
John has a way with words.

88
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:41,812
And, you are a doctor?

89
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:43,047
Not really.

90
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:47,083
You were not
a doctor in the war?

91
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:47,918
I was.

92
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:50,854
Lucia says her husband was a
captain.

93
00:08:50,886 --> 00:08:52,689
Also that he knew you.

94
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:55,325
Only briefly. At Antietam.

95
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:57,827
Your husband was in the Navy-

96
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,929
I hope we're not gonna
turn a family fishing trip

97
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:02,832
into a reenactment of
the Battle of Antietam.

98
00:09:02,865 --> 00:09:04,934
I am sorry, Mr. Roland,
but perhaps-

99
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:07,103
Peter was a
brave union soldier.

100
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:09,939
First lieutenant in the
20th Massachusetts infantry.

101
00:09:09,972 --> 00:09:11,375
That's all you need to know.

102
00:09:13,476 --> 00:09:15,778
He saved men's lives

103
00:09:15,812 --> 00:09:18,282
and brought glory to the
good name of Nantucket.

104
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,451
You have a husband?

105
00:09:22,451 --> 00:09:27,024
He was killed at Gettysburg.

106
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:29,960
I insist we stop this.

107
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:35,264
I missed the war. I slept
through it.

108
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:37,234
The place to be, I would say.

109
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:41,971
My husband told me he was
treated by a doctor from

110
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:45,942
Nantucket who
appeared to him as an angel.

111
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:49,447
There were no angels at
Antietam.

112
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,248
I came to find you.

113
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:57,487
I would like to know why.
Now is not the time.

114
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,488
I agree.

115
00:09:58,522 --> 00:09:59,990
You're interrupting.

116
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:01,191
I haven't had the chance to-

117
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:03,127
- The race is over, John.

118
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:05,295
Will you walk with me?

119
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:07,831
I should go back to town.

120
00:10:07,864 --> 00:10:09,533
I found a rooming house in
Guinea.

121
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:11,835
No. Have, have dinner with us.

122
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:13,370
Peter?

123
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:15,004
Tend to Mother, old boy.

124
00:10:17,474 --> 00:10:18,876
Let me see.

125
00:10:20,342 --> 00:10:23,312
Josephine'll have dinner ready.

126
00:10:23,346 --> 00:10:25,315
We'll join you at the house.

127
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,919
There may be more to this
young woman

128
00:10:29,952 --> 00:10:31,288
than we care to know.

129
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:38,762
It pains me to ask,
but I need to borrow $5.

130
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:41,064
John helped himself to the last
of my cash

131
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:43,033
and I need to be solvent for the
move.

132
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:46,103
Of course, but don't be
so hard on your brother.

133
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:48,938
We need to help him to
find his way in the world.

134
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:51,140
Which will never happen if
this goes on.

135
00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:52,543
The girl is stunning.

136
00:10:54,577 --> 00:10:57,346
Though her pretext for her
arrival at our doorstep

137
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:59,350
just takes my breath away.

138
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:03,353
I wouldn't judge her for that,
not yet.

139
00:11:03,385 --> 00:11:05,889
Is there something
you're not telling me?

140
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:09,860
You have your eye on her.

141
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:15,799
We don't keep secrets.

142
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,470
Oh, it's only you.

143
00:11:20,537 --> 00:11:24,374
Only? I pay your keep young
lady.

144
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:26,243
No, I mean, there was
a fella here earlier,

145
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:28,011
seemed in a hurry to see you.

146
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:30,146
Well, tell me, who was he?

147
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:32,415
A gentlemen. Called twice
while you were away fishing.

148
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:34,550
And what did the gentleman
say?

149
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,818
He was from the notary.

150
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:39,189
He said attorney Bennett would
be here himself this evening.

151
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:45,695
What can it be?

152
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:50,400
An attorney means bad news.
We still owe for storm damage.

153
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:51,467
Or money.

154
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:55,171
But there isn't a single
person on this island

155
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:57,407
that will give or leave us a
nickel.

156
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,943
Not that we haven't
tried to cultivate one.

157
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:02,412
Do you remember your Uncle
Joseph Le bow's second wife?

158
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:06,183
Yes, a Donovan girl.
Daughter of a paper hanger.

159
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:09,620
They had money, and they liked
us.

160
00:12:09,653 --> 00:12:10,620
Yeah.

161
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:12,389
And he was in poor health.

162
00:12:12,922 --> 00:12:14,423
Have they any children?

163
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:16,426
Oh, I should say so.
Four or five.

164
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,294
In my opinion, this important
business

165
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:21,030
has to do with a marriage
proposal for John.

166
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:23,599
Why me? You're the elder.

167
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:27,304
Besides, I do not
wish to marry yet.

168
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:29,572
Oh, so you are
then a ladies' man?

169
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:32,141
Isn't necessary to be a
ladies' man

170
00:12:32,174 --> 00:12:34,176
to say that one does
not wish to marry yet.

171
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,446
Ah good. That explains it.

172
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,647
"Yet," you're waiting.

173
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:42,318
Fine. I'm waiting then, if
you'll have it so.

174
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:45,621
What fools we are to bother
about this.

175
00:12:45,654 --> 00:12:47,690
Attorney Bennett is a friend.

176
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:50,460
He knows that Peter's looking
for a suitable new office

177
00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:51,962
and he's found one.

178
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:53,464
Meal will now be served.

179
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:01,004
I hope we have finished
discussing family matters.

180
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:04,007
Ms. Childs, tell us all about
you.

181
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:06,676
My story is of little
interest, Mrs. Roland.

182
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,079
Won't you tell us from where
you come?

183
00:13:10,113 --> 00:13:11,248
I'm all ears.

184
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:15,485
Cuba, originally.

185
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:19,256
My family fled when I was
just six, to St. Augustine.

186
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:20,356
Why on earth?

187
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:25,194
My father was hunted in Cuba
for his work against slavery.

188
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:27,096
He opposed the Spanish
rulers of my country.

189
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:29,131
If you were against
slavery, then why the hell

190
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:31,067
did your family settle in a
slave state?

191
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,201
Charles, please.

192
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:35,338
No child bears the burden
of what their parents do.

193
00:13:35,905 --> 00:13:38,375
My family wished to stay out
of the war.

194
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:39,209
Many people did.

195
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:40,410
Oh, I'm sure.

196
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:42,646
What about your husband?

197
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:46,216
You said he knew Peter.
Did he fight for the Union?

198
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:47,317
Stop it, Charles.

199
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,319
And don't answer him, Miss
Childs.

200
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:50,687
It's all in good humor.

201
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:55,292
Robert E. Lee brought
20,000 slaves with him

202
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:56,994
to Gettysburg, young lady.

203
00:13:57,693 --> 00:14:00,596
And he grabbed and shackled
every free Negro he encountered

204
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:02,532
on his march through Maryland

205
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:03,667
- and Pennsylvania-
- Miss Childs said

206
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,769
that her family opposed slavery,
Father.

207
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:06,970
Or, weren't you listening?

208
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:10,139
Well I'm guessing that she
married a Confederate officer

209
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:12,408
who defended slave owners.

210
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:13,442
Am I wrong?

211
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:15,245
Yankees built and profited
from the slave trade

212
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:16,446
for 200 years, Father.

213
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:20,350
Our family, including you
young man, were abolitionists.

214
00:14:20,383 --> 00:14:22,719
This island established
the first Quaker meeting

215
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:24,253
in the world opposed to slavery.

216
00:14:24,287 --> 00:14:26,123
While some island Quakers
held onto their slaves

217
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:27,323
for another 50 years.

218
00:14:27,356 --> 00:14:30,995
And the Newport Quakers made
their fortunes from slavery.

219
00:14:31,595 --> 00:14:33,596
Why did you fight in the war,
son?

220
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,399
I didn't fight.

221
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:39,368
I tended to the dead and the
dying.

222
00:14:39,402 --> 00:14:41,572
And yes, because I opposed
slavery,

223
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:44,807
as does Miss Childs, or Mrs.
Childs,

224
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:47,043
which is something we have in
common.

225
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,816
Now that everyone, except our
John,

226
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:55,719
has finally established their
bona fides,

227
00:14:55,751 --> 00:14:59,622
could we forget this nonsense
and enjoy our flounder?

228
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:02,025
My father said-

229
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:04,160
And that includes you, Miss
Childs.

230
00:15:05,628 --> 00:15:07,230
Yes, of course.

231
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:18,141
I do not know what is next for
me.

232
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:20,610
I need to settle a bit.

233
00:15:20,643 --> 00:15:22,112
I hope I will see you.

234
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:36,293
I have only one request.

235
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:38,260
What are you even saying?

236
00:15:38,293 --> 00:15:41,497
Just this time, Peter.
She's what I dreamed of.

237
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:44,200
This talk is absurd on the
face of it.

238
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,769
You act like she's
available for the taking.

239
00:15:45,802 --> 00:15:46,769
Listen Peter-

240
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:48,804
I heard you the first time.

241
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:50,073
Believe me.

242
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,276
I don't disbelieve you.

243
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:55,812
Hup!

244
00:16:01,283 --> 00:16:04,087
Hup.

245
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:11,595
Good afternoon, Josephine.

246
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:14,197
Are the Roland's at home?

247
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,432
Yes, counselor.
Right this way.

248
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:17,533
Good evening, sir.

249
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:22,505
Do you know a certain, a
Mr. Leon Marshall of Boston?

250
00:16:22,538 --> 00:16:24,207
Mm-hmm, we do indeed.

251
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:27,177
He's a friend?

252
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,748
Best of friends. Formerly
a Quaker, same as we were.

253
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,651
Now a devoted Bostonian who
never leaves Beacon Hill.

254
00:16:35,684 --> 00:16:38,787
He made a good deal of
money selling whale oil.

255
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:40,356
Mm-hmm.

256
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:43,225
Mm, I've not
seen him in years.

257
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:46,697
I must tell you,
Mr. Marshall is dead.

258
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,701
Oh dear.

259
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:53,504
He wasn't any older than I am.

260
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:58,341
Well, my notary in Boston
has communicated with me

261
00:16:58,374 --> 00:17:03,379
this morning, the principle
condition of Mr. Marshall's will

262
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:08,785
by which he makes your
son John his sole heir.

263
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:19,663
How will the
inheritance be executed?

264
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,199
Charles, please.

265
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:23,533
Oh, I'm sorry, uh,

266
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:26,936
uh, how did poor Marshall die?

267
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,874
Well, I only know he has no
other heirs,

268
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:34,177
and he has
bequeathed his entire fortune

269
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,815
to your second son, who
he had known since birth

270
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:41,884
and judged to be
worthy of this legacy,

271
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:46,923
which now produces an
income of $17,000 annually.

272
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,659
And should John refuse,
the entire fortune reverts

273
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:53,262
to a charity in Boston
for abandoned children.

274
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:58,468
Christ, what a generous man.

275
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,605
I am very happy to have
brought you this good news.

276
00:18:01,637 --> 00:18:04,441
Your good news is the
death of my parents' friend?

277
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:05,942
Forgive me, of course.

278
00:18:07,343 --> 00:18:09,913
He was very kind
to my brother and me.

279
00:18:09,945 --> 00:18:13,616
He invited us to
dine with him sometimes.

280
00:18:14,983 --> 00:18:18,587
I don't remember much,
except he always hugged me

281
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:19,723
when we met.

282
00:18:23,992 --> 00:18:25,427
You'll have to pardon me.

283
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:26,329
Of course.

284
00:18:27,297 --> 00:18:28,632
Good evening, Mr. Bennett.

285
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,000
Peter.

286
00:18:32,902 --> 00:18:34,604
And there are
no possible challenges

287
00:18:34,636 --> 00:18:36,338
or difficulties to the will?

288
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:38,008
No, none at all.
It's all very clear.

289
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,676
It just requires
John's acceptance.

290
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:52,655
Well, you lucky devil.

291
00:18:52,689 --> 00:18:53,957
Ain't you gonna kiss me?

292
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:57,526
It hadn't
struck me as indispensable

293
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:59,428
to the transaction.

294
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:00,497
Ah.

295
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:06,435
At last, a stroke of fortune.

296
00:19:09,306 --> 00:19:10,841
Did you know
Mr. Marshall well?

297
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,776
Yes, we did.

298
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:18,515
The day you were born, it was
Leon who went for the doctor.

299
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:22,418
We were breakfasting with him
when your mother took sick.

300
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:27,423
In his haste, he grabbed
my hat instead of his.

301
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,527
We had a good laugh
afterwards.

302
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,662
It's likely he remembered
helping bring you into the

303
00:19:32,694 --> 00:19:34,697
world.

304
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:08,565
Come in.

305
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:17,072
Uh, it is best
we talk in private.

306
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:18,442
Indeed.

307
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:21,510
Please, sit.

308
00:20:29,652 --> 00:20:32,689
First, I would uh, I
would like you to tell me

309
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:36,893
on what errand you've come
here and uh, and why now?

310
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:38,660
I thought I had the privilege

311
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:41,096
of asking the first question.

312
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,666
Excuse my bluntness.

313
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:48,471
A Confederate widow needs
to be very discrete here.

314
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:51,707
You fear my presence here is
a danger to your reputation?

315
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,477
Simply stated, yes.

316
00:20:55,678 --> 00:20:57,914
73 men from
Nantucket died in the war.

317
00:20:57,946 --> 00:21:00,383
Please, do not
doubt my discretion.

318
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:04,520
I see this is not a good time.

319
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,957
No, I, I came here to talk.

320
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,530
Your words to your
family at the dinner table

321
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,433
reveal you to be the kind
of man I expected you to be.

322
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,838
Did the attorney
bring you good news?

323
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:24,039
Did he find you an office?

324
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:28,111
No, he came with the offer
of money, to my brother, John.

325
00:21:28,144 --> 00:21:31,513
A family friend left him
a substantial inheritance.

326
00:21:31,547 --> 00:21:32,949
Not to the both of you?

327
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:35,617
No, though it seems odd.

328
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:39,456
An old bachelor with no
heirs leaves his fortune

329
00:21:39,489 --> 00:21:40,824
equally to both brothers.

330
00:21:40,856 --> 00:21:43,058
That would be
simple and natural.

331
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:44,060
Oh, I am sorry.

332
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:46,863
I do not mean to intrude
in your family matters.

333
00:21:46,895 --> 00:21:49,065
And I am equally surprised
that I'm telling you this.

334
00:21:49,097 --> 00:21:50,165
I hardly know you.

335
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:51,735
Nor I you.

336
00:21:53,502 --> 00:21:56,138
Though, your brother's
inheritance

337
00:21:56,172 --> 00:21:57,740
does have a certain logic.

338
00:21:57,772 --> 00:21:58,942
What do you mean?

339
00:21:58,974 --> 00:22:00,644
He is so unlike you.

340
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:02,711
Even, uh-

341
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,080
Even what?

342
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:07,584
Nothing.

343
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:14,657
Let us just say that he has
better luck than you or me.

344
00:22:18,928 --> 00:22:23,066
I can't think. I uh, I
don't belong here right now.

345
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:24,099
Oh.

346
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:29,972
Excuse me, but I don't feel
comfortable saying any more,

347
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:32,542
except that I trust that
you will keep my confidence.

348
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:33,876
I should say
the same thing to you.

349
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,711
You have not revealed anything.

350
00:22:36,711 --> 00:22:40,083
Surely, we will
talk again soon.

351
00:22:42,117 --> 00:22:43,153
Forgive me, Miss Childs.

352
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:46,088
No, there is nothing to
forgive, on the contrary.

353
00:22:46,122 --> 00:22:47,123
Please.

354
00:23:04,906 --> 00:23:06,242
May I join you?

355
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,879
Of course.

356
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,965
I love it here.

357
00:23:29,565 --> 00:23:31,701
When I was in the war,
I used to get through it

358
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:33,736
by imagining I was other places.

359
00:23:34,636 --> 00:23:37,105
I would think about the
times I came down here,

360
00:23:37,138 --> 00:23:39,675
seized by the desire to be on
the boats

361
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,345
to countries with roaming lions

362
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:47,550
and exotic hummingbirds
and stunning girls.

363
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:54,857
You won't have to work now.

364
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:59,228
You can travel
wherever you choose,

365
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:04,267
and find a fair-haired
Swede, or a Southern beauty.

366
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:08,770
Though I think you would
rather land the widow, Lucia.

367
00:24:08,804 --> 00:24:10,940
Though she's
clearly here for you.

368
00:24:10,972 --> 00:24:12,008
You are delusional.

369
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:18,180
Now also rich.

370
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,752
Yes, dear boy,
you are a rich man.

371
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:29,192
I'm very glad to
have come upon you,

372
00:24:30,393 --> 00:24:32,696
to tell you how
pleased I am for you.

373
00:24:34,363 --> 00:24:39,369
How, truly I congratulate you,
and how much I care for you.

374
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:48,044
Thank you, my good Peter.

375
00:24:51,913 --> 00:24:54,150
Now I'll leave you to
dream about the future.

376
00:25:23,878 --> 00:25:25,214
It's me.

377
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:27,182
What's the matter?

378
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:29,251
I just wanted
to say good morning.

379
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:30,653
You're up so early.

380
00:25:31,387 --> 00:25:34,390
I've got patients.
Just a minute.

381
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:45,201
Come in.

382
00:26:03,085 --> 00:26:05,254
Will you be home for dinner?

383
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:06,488
I don't know.

384
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:09,692
I have my sights set on a new
office with a place to live.

385
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:12,095
The widow's
found a boarding house?

386
00:26:12,127 --> 00:26:14,262
She has, the Atlantic House.

387
00:26:14,296 --> 00:26:15,431
In New Guinea.

388
00:26:15,463 --> 00:26:17,399
Miss Childs says
she wants time alone.

389
00:26:17,432 --> 00:26:19,435
It's really nothing, Peter.

390
00:26:20,336 --> 00:26:24,140
It's just, I'll only offer
her as much help as she needs.

391
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:39,021
By the way, mother, I
remember when I was a boy

392
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:42,858
I think I saw a little
portrait of Leon Marshall.

393
00:26:44,192 --> 00:26:47,262
Yes, it could be.

394
00:26:47,296 --> 00:26:49,099
Do you know what became of it?

395
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:54,202
Uh, let me think.

396
00:26:54,236 --> 00:26:56,239
I'm not absolutely sure.

397
00:26:56,705 --> 00:26:58,907
You know, maybe it's in my desk.

398
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:03,412
You look striking.

399
00:27:03,444 --> 00:27:05,914
Do you think
you might find it for me?

400
00:27:05,948 --> 00:27:07,117
I'll look.

401
00:27:08,317 --> 00:27:09,451
I'll look.

402
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:14,456
Why did you want it?

403
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,160
I thought it'd be only
natural to give it to John,

404
00:27:17,192 --> 00:27:19,762
so he can have a picture
of his benefactor.

405
00:27:20,497 --> 00:27:22,865
I will search for it,
after breakfast.

406
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,923
Well, I immediately
thought of this place,

407
00:27:46,955 --> 00:27:48,957
seems quite
fitting for a young doctor.

408
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,961
Yes.

409
00:27:53,028 --> 00:27:54,329
Yes. It's very nice.

410
00:27:59,134 --> 00:28:01,136
I've had my
eye on it for some time.

411
00:28:02,403 --> 00:28:03,471
It's perfect.

412
00:28:03,505 --> 00:28:06,175
Well uh, two doors open
onto two different streets.

413
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:08,009
There are two drawing rooms,

414
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:10,512
a glass corridor where
your patients can wait,

415
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:13,283
and a garden out back.

416
00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:18,086
I can't
imagine a better place.

417
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,155
I'm sure you'd have many
callers.

418
00:28:20,189 --> 00:28:23,192
Yes, I am
expanding my practice.

419
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:26,095
How much might it cost?

420
00:28:26,127 --> 00:28:29,965
1,500 for the year.
It's a three-year lease.

421
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,267
What are the terms?

422
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:34,037
Half down, and the
balance in four months.

423
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:38,473
Do I have time
to think about it?

424
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:40,042
Well, you seem to like it.

425
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:42,510
I want it, I just
need three or four days

426
00:28:42,544 --> 00:28:44,614
to assemble the deposit.

427
00:28:44,646 --> 00:28:46,849
Well, I'll see
what I can do, Doctor.

428
00:28:48,384 --> 00:28:50,519
Do you mind if I just
make some sketches?

429
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:52,120
Oh, be my guest.

430
00:28:52,153 --> 00:28:54,457
Just drop this by my
office when you're done.

431
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:57,093
Thank you.

432
00:29:11,307 --> 00:29:12,942
Where's the new office?

433
00:29:12,974 --> 00:29:16,311
32 Water Street.
I'll make plenty.

434
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,413
How much will
the chemist make?

435
00:29:18,446 --> 00:29:19,481
More.

436
00:29:19,515 --> 00:29:21,050
I'm sold.

437
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:23,052
And each morning, I'll
look out at the harbor,

438
00:29:23,085 --> 00:29:24,921
I'll take a swim, I'll go
downstairs.

439
00:29:24,953 --> 00:29:28,924
I'll see 10 patients a day at
$5 each, that's 12,000 a year.

440
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:31,326
And in the afternoons
I can see old friends,

441
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,229
war veterans, maybe, maybe
I'll just take $2 from them.

442
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,334
Special.

443
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:41,202
I'll be richer than my
brother, Smoke,

444
00:29:41,236 --> 00:29:43,573
and more eminent, knowing
I've made it on my own.

445
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:57,220
I'm looking for Miss Childs.

446
00:29:57,752 --> 00:29:59,087
The widow?

447
00:30:02,324 --> 00:30:04,360
And now with
her and your brother-

448
00:30:04,393 --> 00:30:06,395
Is that where she is,
with my brother?

449
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:11,200
You could use a girl,
in your office.

450
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:15,538
I can work for you, mind my own
business.

451
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:18,340
I don't earn
enough to pay myself.

452
00:30:18,374 --> 00:30:19,575
I'd get them to pay.

453
00:30:27,516 --> 00:30:30,152
I would like you to give
this to your new boarder.

454
00:30:30,184 --> 00:30:35,057
It's just to let her know where
I am in case she needs help.

455
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:42,999
Good day, Miss Ross.

456
00:30:50,305 --> 00:30:52,541
Not if it hurts my brother.

457
00:30:52,574 --> 00:30:55,010
The simple thing would
be to refuse the money.

458
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:56,145
Why?

459
00:30:56,778 --> 00:30:59,382
Believe me,
you will find it useful.

460
00:30:59,414 --> 00:31:02,084
Yes, how many times
do you say to yourself,

461
00:31:02,116 --> 00:31:04,353
"Damn, if
I only had some money."

462
00:31:04,385 --> 00:31:07,389
Wouldn't you agree, no
woman wants to marry a man?

463
00:31:07,423 --> 00:31:10,226
Marry?

464
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:13,261
I would rather
be a mole than a wife.

465
00:31:13,295 --> 00:31:15,431
You're not marrying again?

466
00:31:15,463 --> 00:31:19,100
You came here to Nantucket
with no thoughts of marriage?

467
00:31:19,134 --> 00:31:21,636
You plan to live as a
widow, a single woman.

468
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:25,508
John, I simply
came out for a walk.

469
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,609
I just meant it,
it won't be easy.

470
00:31:27,643 --> 00:31:29,178
I didn't mean to suggest-

471
00:31:29,211 --> 00:31:32,214
We both know what is going on.

472
00:31:34,682 --> 00:31:36,786
You hid in the bushes all
morning,

473
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:39,489
waiting for me to come
out of the boarding house.

474
00:31:40,388 --> 00:31:42,190
I don't mean to be forward.

475
00:31:43,392 --> 00:31:45,061
Your eyes are shrinking.

476
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:47,596
Lucia.

477
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:52,602
Lucia.

478
00:34:26,655 --> 00:34:28,990
I would set myself up in a
handsome home

479
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:30,893
that makes
people open their eyes.

480
00:34:32,027 --> 00:34:33,996
You also ought
to ride on horseback.

481
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:35,398
People will notice.

482
00:34:35,998 --> 00:34:38,434
Select one or
two good cases to defend.

483
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:40,635
Make your mark in court.

484
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:45,574
And you do not want to give up
the benefit of your studies.

485
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:48,510
A man ought never to sit idle.

486
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:49,545
Fiddlesticks.

487
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:51,313
You don't agree, Charles?

488
00:34:51,346 --> 00:34:54,849
I just want him to get his
own apartment. Now he can.

489
00:34:54,882 --> 00:34:56,885
But we're not beasts of burden.

490
00:34:57,686 --> 00:35:00,889
The smartest thing in
life is to take it easy.

491
00:35:00,922 --> 00:35:03,525
There, you and I disagree,
Father.

492
00:35:03,557 --> 00:35:06,829
He'd be a fool to work
himself into the ground.

493
00:35:06,862 --> 00:35:09,697
11 grueling years on a
whaling vessel taught me that

494
00:35:09,731 --> 00:35:10,699
and nothing else.

495
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:13,001
It's not John's wealth
that gives him worth.

496
00:35:13,034 --> 00:35:15,670
In the hands of some men,
wealth can be a powerful lever.

497
00:35:15,704 --> 00:35:16,839
Those men are few though.

498
00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:17,806
Oh.

499
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,742
If John wants to be
a truly superior man,

500
00:35:20,775 --> 00:35:23,778
he needs to
show it by what he does.

501
00:35:24,378 --> 00:35:25,581
Tra-la-la.

502
00:35:25,614 --> 00:35:26,782
Pardon, Father?

503
00:35:26,815 --> 00:35:28,983
When you have a large income
you would be stupid to work.

504
00:35:29,016 --> 00:35:30,985
Again, we differ, Father.

505
00:35:31,018 --> 00:35:32,887
I have a request
for John though.

506
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,589
Surely, what is it?

507
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,559
I need a loan, or at
least the money back

508
00:35:38,592 --> 00:35:40,495
that you've borrowed.

509
00:35:40,528 --> 00:35:41,864
I need it soon.

510
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:45,934
We have a full afternoon
planned for your brother.

511
00:35:46,802 --> 00:35:47,870
Won't you join us?

512
00:35:51,972 --> 00:35:53,574
Let him do as he wishes.

513
00:35:53,608 --> 00:35:55,644
Surely you
weren't expecting me.

514
00:35:55,677 --> 00:35:56,679
Peter.

515
00:35:59,547 --> 00:36:00,548
Peter.

516
00:36:07,722 --> 00:36:10,092
You're awfully
frosty this morning.

517
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,592
Father is wrong.

518
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:14,363
The smartest thing in life
is not to take it easy.

519
00:36:14,396 --> 00:36:18,367
The smartest thing in life
is to avoid dangerous emotions.

520
00:36:19,668 --> 00:36:20,869
How?

521
00:36:20,902 --> 00:36:22,538
I have complete faith in you.

522
00:36:23,704 --> 00:36:25,574
Come home in time for dinner.

523
00:36:25,606 --> 00:36:27,509
Help us plan a celebration
for your brother.

524
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:30,578
I've got a patient who's
asked for an overnight call.

525
00:36:30,612 --> 00:36:31,947
What is it, Peter?

526
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:35,918
You'll get your new
patients, your new office.

527
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:39,454
I don't have to worry
about you like I do John.

528
00:36:41,123 --> 00:36:42,692
He doesn't have your drive.

529
00:36:52,134 --> 00:36:54,003
What is to
become of me, Mother?

530
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:09,884
Miss Childs.

531
00:37:09,918 --> 00:37:11,053
I got your note.

532
00:37:12,086 --> 00:37:13,621
I'm a bit late.

533
00:37:13,655 --> 00:37:16,659
My comment about you
and John was uncalled for.

534
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:19,027
I hadn't thought of it.

535
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:21,663
But uh, now,
I think you're right.

536
00:37:21,695 --> 00:37:23,699
We do look different.

537
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:27,736
My brother
should refuse the money.

538
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:29,604
You have never wanted money?

539
00:37:29,637 --> 00:37:30,806
Of course.

540
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:32,440
In fact, I need it
now to secure a place

541
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:33,876
before I lose
my practice entirely.

542
00:37:33,909 --> 00:37:35,477
So you
understand John's dilemma.

543
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,445
I just think
there's more to it.

544
00:37:36,478 --> 00:37:37,945
My brother would do
better to give it away.

545
00:37:37,978 --> 00:37:38,946
Dr. Roland.

546
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,880
What is it?

547
00:37:39,914 --> 00:37:41,617
Do you mind, sir?
We're looking for you.

548
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,018
Well, my hours commence
at one. What's the problem?

549
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,653
A girl, she's been hurt.

550
00:37:45,686 --> 00:37:46,654
Where?

551
00:37:46,688 --> 00:37:47,655
Just up the street.

552
00:37:47,688 --> 00:37:48,656
What happened?

553
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,693
A carriage ran right over her.

554
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:53,128
We need to leave her here.

555
00:37:54,596 --> 00:37:55,630
Her artery's ruptured.

556
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:57,065
What do I do?

557
00:37:57,097 --> 00:38:00,501
My surgical tools
are in a glass case.

558
00:38:00,534 --> 00:38:03,571
There's a bone saw. The
chloroform is marked.

559
00:38:03,605 --> 00:38:04,773
Okay.

560
00:39:02,163 --> 00:39:03,699
Lucia?

561
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:11,039
Come in.

562
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:12,074
Thank you.

563
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,244
Luck that you are here.

564
00:39:23,552 --> 00:39:25,554
I can ask for tea.

565
00:39:25,586 --> 00:39:26,688
No, thank you.

566
00:39:28,623 --> 00:39:30,559
I am concerned about Peter.

567
00:39:30,592 --> 00:39:32,760
Why? What happened?

568
00:39:32,793 --> 00:39:33,761
Oh, why am I telling you?

569
00:39:33,795 --> 00:39:37,166
I, I assumed that you
might know something.

570
00:39:39,568 --> 00:39:42,104
Things get inside him and they
stay there.

571
00:39:42,137 --> 00:39:45,140
Can I help? I care deeply.

572
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:49,979
Please.

573
00:39:56,851 --> 00:39:59,054
He suspects that I
have turned against him.

574
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:07,262
It probably seems strange
why I came here to find him.

575
00:40:07,295 --> 00:40:09,798
I'm sure he needs
someone to make him happy.

576
00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:11,300
That is not my intention.

577
00:40:12,867 --> 00:40:14,570
Well what are your intentions?

578
00:40:15,903 --> 00:40:17,039
I am not sure.

579
00:40:21,108 --> 00:40:23,112
And what about my poor John?

580
00:40:23,778 --> 00:40:27,748
He has his faults, but
the look in his eyes

581
00:40:27,782 --> 00:40:28,951
when he sees you.

582
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:29,985
Yes.

583
00:40:39,126 --> 00:40:40,228
May I?

584
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,262
Yes.

585
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,966
Photographs of your family?

586
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,867
Friends.

587
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:49,905
Women who
lost their lovers in the war.

588
00:40:53,775 --> 00:40:54,777
Like I have.

589
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,750
It sounds awful, Peter.

590
00:41:04,652 --> 00:41:06,688
The girl probably
didn't have a chance.

591
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:11,860
Still, if I had
gotten there sooner.

592
00:41:12,793 --> 00:41:13,962
You can't assume that.

593
00:41:16,731 --> 00:41:18,067
God, I need a drink.

594
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:27,041
So where were we?
You need a loan.

595
00:41:29,744 --> 00:41:33,715
I'm ready to start a new
practice, John, but I need

596
00:41:33,748 --> 00:41:34,950
money.

597
00:41:34,983 --> 00:41:37,285
Of course. I'll help.

598
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:38,386
Thank you.

599
00:41:38,418 --> 00:41:41,322
I don't have an exact figure
for what you borrowed,

600
00:41:41,356 --> 00:41:42,891
but uh, now that you-

601
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:44,793
What's the money for?

602
00:41:44,826 --> 00:41:46,260
A new office.

603
00:41:46,293 --> 00:41:48,931
A grand place that can get
my business going again.

604
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:53,100
I need $750.

605
00:41:53,134 --> 00:41:54,402
I'll pay what I can.

606
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,338
But I can't immediately,
I've already paid the deposit

607
00:41:57,371 --> 00:41:59,875
on a new place on Water Street.

608
00:41:59,907 --> 00:42:01,076
You've what? Where?

609
00:42:01,108 --> 00:42:02,943
32 Water Street.

610
00:42:02,976 --> 00:42:03,944
32 Water Street?

611
00:42:03,978 --> 00:42:06,048
It's a splendid place, Peter.

612
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:09,184
Two drawing rooms,
a grand glass corridor,

613
00:42:09,217 --> 00:42:10,885
and a fine garden.

614
00:42:11,518 --> 00:42:14,188
It's a little elegant for my
taste, but,

615
00:42:14,222 --> 00:42:15,457
well you never know.

616
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:16,891
Can you afford this?

617
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,795
You know you owe me money.

618
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:21,997
I'll pay you
back what I borrowed

619
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,699
but it's not more than 300.

620
00:42:23,731 --> 00:42:24,365
It's more than 300.

621
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,434
I just can't pay it all now.

622
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:27,802
Settle down, brother.

623
00:42:27,835 --> 00:42:28,971
Settle down?

624
00:42:29,603 --> 00:42:32,140
You know that I have
been looking for a place.

625
00:42:33,007 --> 00:42:37,178
You were right Peter.
I need to set myself up.

626
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:40,182
Become a superior man.

627
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,818
Mother's two sons,
both superior men.

628
00:42:48,889 --> 00:42:50,391
You bastard.

629
00:43:24,259 --> 00:43:28,197
Hm. This little
discussion, making me hungry.

630
00:43:30,264 --> 00:43:32,467
Goodness man, we've not
yet found your cure.

631
00:43:34,235 --> 00:43:35,437
You won't.

632
00:44:17,045 --> 00:44:22,017
The cottage is available for
$12 a month for six months.

633
00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:24,051
Will I like it?

634
00:44:24,085 --> 00:44:24,985
Until it gets cold,

635
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:27,155
I think you'll find the island
just fine.

636
00:44:30,123 --> 00:44:32,126
You remain a
mystery to me, Miss Childs.

637
00:44:34,295 --> 00:44:36,597
You presume that I tended your
husband on the battlefield,

638
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,500
but nothing you say convinces,

639
00:44:39,534 --> 00:44:43,838
and nothing explains why
you've made this long journey.

640
00:44:47,074 --> 00:44:49,110
I killed a Union soldier,
Peter.

641
00:44:53,213 --> 00:44:54,349
I had to.

642
00:44:54,382 --> 00:44:55,384
Please.

643
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,188
And I conducted espionage
for the Confederacy.

644
00:45:00,554 --> 00:45:03,090
I came here to find comfort.

645
00:45:03,123 --> 00:45:05,092
I had nowhere else to go.

646
00:45:05,126 --> 00:45:07,195
For reasons I can't fathom,

647
00:45:07,228 --> 00:45:09,463
you have come here to expose me

648
00:45:09,496 --> 00:45:11,031
and to ruin
what prospects I have.

649
00:45:11,065 --> 00:45:12,434
No.

650
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:13,702
What
consideration do I owe you

651
00:45:13,735 --> 00:45:17,271
that I did not already unduly
show your husband at Antietam?

652
00:45:17,304 --> 00:45:18,406
Peter.

653
00:45:34,956 --> 00:45:37,259
I feel that I am accumulating
debts for a payment

654
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:38,893
that I never promised to make.

655
00:45:41,628 --> 00:45:43,498
When I was a girl, Peter,

656
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:47,269
Union soldiers invaded my
family's home.

657
00:45:49,603 --> 00:45:52,240
There were only three of
them, but that was enough.

658
00:45:54,175 --> 00:45:57,144
They beat my father
and they took him away,

659
00:45:58,012 --> 00:46:00,349
accusing him of
financing the rebels.

660
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:05,920
He was a
Cuban expatriate and a farmer.

661
00:46:07,387 --> 00:46:09,391
He had nothing
to do with the war.

662
00:46:12,994 --> 00:46:14,930
They wasted no time with us.

663
00:46:17,164 --> 00:46:21,268
First night, they took my
sisters upstairs

664
00:46:21,302 --> 00:46:23,305
and had their way with them.

665
00:46:24,672 --> 00:46:26,608
And they
were only a landing away.

666
00:46:27,275 --> 00:46:29,478
And I could still hear them.

667
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:32,547
My sisters were strong,

668
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:35,583
and they fought and they cursed
these men.

669
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:40,289
I hid in the stables.

670
00:46:41,188 --> 00:46:44,625
And when the
third soldier came for me,

671
00:46:44,659 --> 00:46:47,061
I killed him
with my father's pistol.

672
00:46:50,097 --> 00:46:53,567
I road on horseback and
I found a rebel outpost,

673
00:46:53,601 --> 00:46:55,637
and I offered to
find Yankee troops

674
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:57,539
and report their location.

675
00:46:58,472 --> 00:47:00,275
I bartered for my survival.

676
00:47:07,315 --> 00:47:08,650
As for my husband,

677
00:47:12,219 --> 00:47:13,355
he was my contact.

678
00:47:14,722 --> 00:47:17,559
A captain I
informed of what I saw.

679
00:47:19,527 --> 00:47:21,195
And he was killed?

680
00:47:21,228 --> 00:47:24,031
Yes. In Pickett's Charge.

681
00:47:27,702 --> 00:47:31,373
I saw it,
and I heard the sounds.

682
00:47:36,577 --> 00:47:37,446
I am cold.

683
00:48:05,505 --> 00:48:08,509
When the war began, there
were few doctors on either side,

684
00:48:10,077 --> 00:48:12,579
and thousands
killed and wounded,

685
00:48:12,612 --> 00:48:16,683
sometimes in a single day.

686
00:48:16,717 --> 00:48:21,389
I enlisted, after
going down to the dock

687
00:48:22,056 --> 00:48:24,692
to see the first steamboat
coming back from the battlefront

688
00:48:24,724 --> 00:48:26,394
carrying island soldiers.

689
00:48:28,463 --> 00:48:30,499
Everyone turned out. It was a
holiday.

690
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,202
Until we saw the steamer coming
into port,

691
00:48:35,235 --> 00:48:37,239
its flag at half-mast.

692
00:48:37,905 --> 00:48:43,110
And there were six young
island men on board in caskets.

693
00:48:48,849 --> 00:48:51,252
I went to the front to
serve the Union cause.

694
00:48:53,855 --> 00:48:55,724
Almost immediately I wanted out.

695
00:49:00,128 --> 00:49:03,231
I tended to Southern soldiers,
yes, and more than once.

696
00:49:05,565 --> 00:49:10,571
I suppose I saw a dying
soldier as no longer the enemy.

697
00:49:11,806 --> 00:49:14,141
Armed and upright? Yes.

698
00:49:14,175 --> 00:49:18,413
But, crying
out at night in a field

699
00:49:19,112 --> 00:49:22,416
with thousands of dying men, no.

700
00:49:22,449 --> 00:49:26,253
You did see my husband,
Wilbert Childs?

701
00:49:26,286 --> 00:49:29,690
I tended three rebel
fighters at Antietam,

702
00:49:29,724 --> 00:49:32,727
and one was a captain
in Lee's Virginia Army.

703
00:49:33,793 --> 00:49:38,732
I found him huddled in
stark terror in a culvert,

704
00:49:39,934 --> 00:49:42,137
buried under
a dozen dead soldiers.

705
00:49:42,769 --> 00:49:46,574
Hours after the battle, I
heard him crying out for mercy

706
00:49:46,606 --> 00:49:49,311
and I went to him,

707
00:49:50,077 --> 00:49:52,813
not knowing if the voice
was from the North or South.

708
00:49:54,614 --> 00:49:56,617
You amputated his left arm.

709
00:50:00,721 --> 00:50:02,724
I thought he would live.

710
00:50:04,659 --> 00:50:06,728
To fight another day at
Gettysburg?

711
00:50:08,262 --> 00:50:09,664
Well, he promised me
he wouldn't fight again.

712
00:50:09,697 --> 00:50:11,532
That was my condition.

713
00:50:11,565 --> 00:50:13,567
Even if I didn't
always believe him.

714
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,242
My family doesn't
know this about me.

715
00:50:21,608 --> 00:50:23,612
No one on this island does.

716
00:50:24,411 --> 00:50:27,347
I became a medic because
I refused to fight.

717
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:30,384
But I am a patriotic
veteran of the Union army.

718
00:50:33,253 --> 00:50:37,491
I held a dozen island boys in
my arms and watched them die.

719
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:40,895
And I saved many more.

720
00:50:47,802 --> 00:50:48,836
I don't sleep much.

721
00:51:04,452 --> 00:51:07,656
I'm certain my sisters'
attackers have not forgotten me.

722
00:51:09,789 --> 00:51:11,393
I have not forgotten them.

723
00:51:12,592 --> 00:51:13,928
Is that why you're here?

724
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:16,464
You're running, is that it?

725
00:51:18,632 --> 00:51:21,502
The ceasefire did nothing for
the South.

726
00:51:23,003 --> 00:51:24,538
Teachers killed.

727
00:51:25,606 --> 00:51:28,610
A Negro man
refuses to tip his hat,

728
00:51:28,643 --> 00:51:30,644
and he is
shot dead in the street.

729
00:51:32,847 --> 00:51:33,848
Why would I stay?

730
00:51:35,349 --> 00:51:36,851
I could not go back to Cuba.

731
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:46,694
And your kindness to my
husband drew me here.

732
00:52:25,398 --> 00:52:28,769
Where's Peter?
He's always late.

733
00:52:28,802 --> 00:52:30,904
I say we begin without him.

734
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:33,074
Look at this man.

735
00:52:33,106 --> 00:52:36,411
A whaler retired long ago,

736
00:52:36,443 --> 00:52:41,449
with neither thighs,
chest, arms, nor neck.

737
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:49,056
I, on the contrary, am as tight
as an egg,

738
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:53,061
and as hard as a cannonball.

739
00:52:53,094 --> 00:52:54,028
Oh.

740
00:52:54,061 --> 00:52:54,896
May I?

741
00:52:54,929 --> 00:52:56,764
You may.

742
00:52:57,664 --> 00:52:59,000
Ah!

743
00:53:00,034 --> 00:53:03,838
To all of us.
Lift your glasses.

744
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:08,409
To the man
with a bank draft

745
00:53:08,442 --> 00:53:09,510
in his new account.

746
00:53:09,543 --> 00:53:12,947
17,000 per annum,
free and clear.

747
00:53:19,387 --> 00:53:20,889
Dinner is served.

748
00:53:24,657 --> 00:53:28,395
No, no, no, no. Tonight
everything is for John.

749
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:30,865
Ah, well.

750
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,068
It's all right.

751
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:42,710
And then I just
, I saw,

752
00:53:42,742 --> 00:53:45,045
I was 10, and there
was Christ right there,

753
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:46,814
standing on the clothes.

754
00:53:56,956 --> 00:54:01,962
And then I saw the oddest
looking fish.

755
00:54:04,731 --> 00:54:09,737
With its gold goggles
and, and fat, red belly.

756
00:54:11,905 --> 00:54:16,911
And its fan-shaped fins, and
its, at the bottom, a tail.

757
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:20,882
It was crescent-shaped, the
tail.

758
00:54:20,914 --> 00:54:22,983
And there it was, and it
was starting to go away.

759
00:54:23,016 --> 00:54:25,652
Away, oh, ah-oh,
there it is now.

760
00:54:28,021 --> 00:54:29,724
What the devil?

761
00:54:29,757 --> 00:54:31,057
I should have
eaten at the Sea Shack.

762
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:33,560
Peter, we kept the soup warm.

763
00:54:33,594 --> 00:54:38,532
Last time I ate at the Sea
Shack I was sick for two weeks.

764
00:54:42,702 --> 00:54:46,072
I like that sound
better than a pistol shot.

765
00:54:46,106 --> 00:54:48,643
It may be more
dangerous for you.

766
00:54:48,675 --> 00:54:49,777
How so, lieutenant?

767
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:50,911
Because the bullet might miss,

768
00:54:50,945 --> 00:54:51,713
but the wine is dead certain

769
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,881
to hit you straight in the
stomach.

770
00:54:53,914 --> 00:54:54,983
And then what?

771
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:57,617
Then it scorches your
intestines,

772
00:54:57,650 --> 00:54:58,819
shocks your nervous system,

773
00:54:58,853 --> 00:55:00,887
and makes your circulation
sluggish,

774
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,889
which can lead
to an apoplectic fit,

775
00:55:02,922 --> 00:55:04,825
which threatens the end
for a man of your build

776
00:55:04,858 --> 00:55:05,927
and temperament.

777
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:11,099
Ah, these damn doctors,
they all sing the same tune.

778
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:14,669
Eat nothing, drink nothing.

779
00:55:14,702 --> 00:55:19,507
Cut the gamahuching. Keep
your bawbles in your pocket.

780
00:55:19,539 --> 00:55:24,545
Well sir, I have practiced all
of these forbidden pleasures

781
00:55:27,181 --> 00:55:31,586
and more, wherever
and whenever I pleased.

782
00:55:32,887 --> 00:55:34,556
That's when I did it.

783
00:55:35,588 --> 00:55:36,791
Here, here.

784
00:55:36,824 --> 00:55:39,092
And I'm none the worse for it.

785
00:55:39,126 --> 00:55:41,262
All bon vivants
talk as you do,

786
00:55:41,295 --> 00:55:43,831
until the day when they
can no longer crawl back

787
00:55:43,864 --> 00:55:47,835
to tell the prudent
doctor, "You were right."

788
00:55:47,867 --> 00:55:50,837
Peter, think what a wonderful
occasion this is for John,

789
00:55:50,871 --> 00:55:52,606
and for all of us.

790
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:54,842
You're mean to, to spoil it.

791
00:56:02,115 --> 00:56:04,117
You really think this will
kill me?

792
00:56:05,818 --> 00:56:09,190
I'm sure of it, but drink it
this once.

793
00:56:09,222 --> 00:56:10,291
Not too much.

794
00:56:10,324 --> 00:56:12,726
Ah.

795
00:56:17,565 --> 00:56:22,570
I propose a toast to
celebrate the ascension

796
00:56:26,673 --> 00:56:28,309
of John, the rich.

797
00:56:28,342 --> 00:56:29,878
Here, here.

798
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:46,627
Peter.

799
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:53,000
My only desire is to fly
away from these people,

800
00:56:53,032 --> 00:56:55,635
to leave their
idle talk and silly jests.

801
00:56:55,668 --> 00:56:58,806
And their joy. You are
jealous, that is all.

802
00:56:58,838 --> 00:57:00,775
I'm not jealous.

803
00:57:00,807 --> 00:57:02,143
You are, it is shameful.

804
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:05,012
Don't leave.

805
00:57:17,157 --> 00:57:19,693
You are in
my good graces John,

806
00:57:19,726 --> 00:57:23,163
because the
wine cheers my foul temper.

807
00:57:28,369 --> 00:57:31,573
And prevents me from saying
what I would like to say to you.

808
00:57:32,873 --> 00:57:34,108
Which is what?

809
00:57:34,942 --> 00:57:36,144
I don't remember.

810
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:41,815
Well, we are here tonight
to honor our dear friend John.

811
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,018
It is said that
fortune is blind.

812
00:57:45,052 --> 00:57:47,622
I say she is simply
shortsighted,

813
00:57:47,655 --> 00:57:51,325
and has lately acquired one
hell of a good pair of glasses,

814
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:55,396
so that she may see our
remote little island

815
00:57:55,429 --> 00:58:00,635
and the son of our worthy
comrade, and my friend, Charles,

816
00:58:03,003 --> 00:58:04,872
captain of the Little Pearl.

817
00:58:08,108 --> 00:58:10,978
Thank you captain.

818
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:15,782
I and my son will not forget
you, or this occasion.

819
00:58:16,449 --> 00:58:17,985
I drink to your wishes.

820
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:28,096
Sit down. It's my turn.

821
00:58:31,431 --> 00:58:33,967
It is I who should
thank my devoted friends,

822
00:58:35,068 --> 00:58:39,641
who today give me touching
proof of their affection.

823
00:58:41,909 --> 00:58:45,079
But it is not with words
that I will show my thanks.

824
00:58:45,878 --> 00:58:51,085
I shall prove it tomorrow, and
always, through my actions.

825
00:58:53,052 --> 00:58:54,954
Well said, my boy.

826
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:02,063
Miss Childs give us a
toast from the fairer sex.

827
00:59:05,164 --> 00:59:08,402
Let us offer our
thoughts to the fond memory

828
00:59:08,434 --> 00:59:09,770
of Mr. Marshall.

829
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:15,209
It takes a woman to pay
so delicate a tribute.

830
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,351
Who the blazes
was Marshall, anyway?

831
00:59:24,918 --> 00:59:28,255
You must've been
quite intimate with him.

832
00:59:28,288 --> 00:59:31,291
The finest kind,
like a brother.

833
00:59:31,759 --> 00:59:34,295
Such a friend
we won't find twice.

834
00:59:35,061 --> 00:59:38,465
He dined with us, took us
to the theater in Boston.

835
00:59:40,467 --> 00:59:42,336
Need we say more, Louise?

836
00:59:43,135 --> 00:59:48,275
Yes, Charles,
a faithful friend.

837
00:59:50,943 --> 00:59:52,746
I've had enough.

838
00:59:53,947 --> 00:59:55,149
Evidently.

839
00:59:58,085 --> 01:00:00,186
Excuse me.

840
01:00:00,219 --> 01:00:01,355
Peter.

841
01:00:13,432 --> 01:00:14,469
Peter.

842
01:00:22,342 --> 01:00:25,278
Peter, come to
your senses and calm down.

843
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:26,279
Go back inside.

844
01:00:26,313 --> 01:00:27,414
I will not go back inside.

845
01:00:27,447 --> 01:00:29,784
Don't talk to me in that tone.

846
01:00:29,817 --> 01:00:32,353
Have you found your
photograph of Leon Marshall?

847
01:00:34,353 --> 01:00:36,356
Where did you find that?

848
01:00:37,324 --> 01:00:39,327
Did you deceive my father?

849
01:00:40,927 --> 01:00:45,866
This honest and mediocre
man.

850
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:52,038
Oh, I'm sure you married,
as young girls do,

851
01:00:53,606 --> 01:00:56,878
the man with a promise of a
fortune from stripping oil.

852
01:00:58,945 --> 01:01:02,315
The boy was not cut out for
years on end on the high seas

853
01:01:02,349 --> 01:01:04,818
chasing a vanishing,
reluctant prey, was he?

854
01:01:05,485 --> 01:01:07,487
And what of this tender woman?

855
01:01:07,954 --> 01:01:10,023
Shut up for years in his absence

856
01:01:10,056 --> 01:01:13,526
and tied to him when he returns
to drink and smoke cigars,

857
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:17,197
and, and talk of money, boats,
and fish.

858
01:01:18,298 --> 01:01:21,601
And then one day a man appears,
as lovers do in novels,

859
01:01:21,635 --> 01:01:24,939
and he speaks as lovers speak.

860
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:27,608
Of course, you
found love in his arms.

861
01:01:27,641 --> 01:01:28,809
- Oh, Peter.
- And of course,

862
01:01:28,842 --> 01:01:32,246
you allowed him to draw up a
chair in another man's home.

863
01:01:32,278 --> 01:01:36,083
This, this, this man of means,

864
01:01:36,115 --> 01:01:38,485
growing rich from brokering
whale oil

865
01:01:39,152 --> 01:01:42,088
pretending to be a family
friend while making a fool

866
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:47,061
of my father, myself, my
brother, and yes, you.

867
01:01:48,061 --> 01:01:49,396
What?

868
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:56,336
Did you give yourself to him?

869
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:02,376
This man, who even now,
faraway and grown old,

870
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:06,646
leaves his fortune to your
son, your son with him.

871
01:03:07,139 --> 01:03:09,609
Perhaps you
should forget all of this

872
01:03:10,376 --> 01:03:13,246
about your
brother and the money.

873
01:03:14,246 --> 01:03:15,148
Why pursuit it?

874
01:03:15,983 --> 01:03:20,922
Why? Because of the
obvious hiding and cheating.

875
01:03:23,456 --> 01:03:25,492
Why didL eon Marshall not see
this result

876
01:03:26,492 --> 01:03:28,496
of causing chaos in my family?

877
01:03:31,197 --> 01:03:33,299
Why did my father not feel it?

878
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:35,336
And he is nearly giddy.

879
01:03:35,869 --> 01:03:37,738
Why does my mother pretend
that this is something

880
01:03:37,771 --> 01:03:39,307
other than what it is?

881
01:03:40,539 --> 01:03:44,411
No, the way in which
this unexpected fortune

882
01:03:44,443 --> 01:03:49,449
has arrived now, so fills my
mind that there is little room

883
01:03:49,949 --> 01:03:51,652
for other thought.

884
01:03:51,684 --> 01:03:53,619
To whom should it matter?

885
01:03:53,652 --> 01:03:55,655
To the public, of course.

886
01:03:56,489 --> 01:03:58,491
To our neighbors.

887
01:03:59,525 --> 01:04:02,096
Why should anyone care, Peter?

888
01:04:02,128 --> 01:04:05,031
When they're speaking
of the Roland sons,

889
01:04:05,065 --> 01:04:08,335
will they not ask,
"Which is the truth

890
01:04:08,367 --> 01:04:10,371
and which is the false one?"

891
01:04:11,605 --> 01:04:14,608
Walk with me, please.

892
01:04:43,436 --> 01:04:46,440
All of our endeavors are like
the laborers of these urchins.

893
01:04:49,076 --> 01:04:50,711
How I might
like to beget two or three

894
01:04:50,744 --> 01:04:53,514
of these little creatures,
watch them grow up,

895
01:04:53,547 --> 01:04:55,182
mindless of all that we endure.

896
01:05:00,186 --> 01:05:02,222
Perhaps I long for marriage,
Miss Childs.

897
01:05:03,722 --> 01:05:05,726
Is this a new feeling?

898
01:05:08,661 --> 01:05:10,397
You know, I know very little
of women.

899
01:05:14,266 --> 01:05:16,436
A man is not so lost when he is
not alone.

900
01:05:18,838 --> 01:05:21,275
Just to feel someone stirring
beside me

901
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:27,380
in hours of doubt on
uncertainty,

902
01:05:32,184 --> 01:05:33,653
to feel the presence of a woman.

903
01:05:35,489 --> 01:05:38,492
A woman's kiss,
the touch of her hand,

904
01:05:38,525 --> 01:05:40,528
the rustle of her petticoat.

905
01:05:42,262 --> 01:05:44,265
The soft look in her eyes.

906
01:05:47,134 --> 01:05:49,135
To calm my needful heart.

907
01:05:53,306 --> 01:05:58,311
I do not want to kiss you.

908
01:05:59,278 --> 01:06:00,748
You know that I am fond of you.

909
01:06:05,751 --> 01:06:07,755
You prefer John.

910
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:03,309
Your mother says not to
expect you for the picnic.

911
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:06,614
Lucia'll be here shortly.

912
01:07:07,681 --> 01:07:08,548
Are you going?

913
01:07:10,217 --> 01:07:11,552
Maybe not.

914
01:07:15,454 --> 01:07:16,789
You look cross.

915
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,463
No. Should I be?

916
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:25,733
I'm happy you're home,

917
01:07:26,967 --> 01:07:29,202
but you shouldn't fight with
your brother.

918
01:07:30,603 --> 01:07:33,806
We've been lucky enough to
receive this inheritance.

919
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,843
Yet, it's as if we're in
mourning.

920
01:07:36,543 --> 01:07:37,611
I am in a way.

921
01:07:37,643 --> 01:07:38,912
You are?

922
01:07:40,679 --> 01:07:41,548
Who for?

923
01:07:42,548 --> 01:07:44,418
A woman. No one you knew.

924
01:07:45,418 --> 01:07:46,753
Well, I won't pry.

925
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:49,623
Though it's obvious.

926
01:07:49,655 --> 01:07:50,724
I hope you recover.

927
01:07:53,994 --> 01:07:57,565
Do you understand
what I'm talking about?

928
01:07:59,398 --> 01:08:03,469
Do you? Think
what you're doing.

929
01:08:07,574 --> 01:08:08,909
I've heard enough.

930
01:08:11,844 --> 01:08:13,547
Louise.

931
01:08:13,579 --> 01:08:16,317
You look terrible,
for god's sake.

932
01:08:19,953 --> 01:08:22,789
Can't you see
that your mother's not well?

933
01:08:22,822 --> 01:08:24,490
Will you do something?

934
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,802
I'm just tired.

935
01:08:39,305 --> 01:08:40,473
Let me see.

936
01:08:43,943 --> 01:08:45,613
It's nothing, really.

937
01:08:46,246 --> 01:08:48,449
I'm going to find some
vinegar.

938
01:08:54,554 --> 01:08:56,556
I'm not afraid of you.

939
01:08:57,890 --> 01:08:59,359
Come on then.

940
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:12,739
Your pulse is quite fast.

941
01:09:14,606 --> 01:09:16,743
You should take something
to calm you down.

942
01:09:18,712 --> 01:09:20,714
I have pills in my bag upstairs.

943
01:09:23,649 --> 01:09:24,851
What is it, Louise?

944
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:32,059
I've never seen her like this.

945
01:09:33,926 --> 01:09:36,028
She'll be fine, it's just
nerves.

946
01:09:36,061 --> 01:09:37,698
The fresh air will do her good.

947
01:09:40,533 --> 01:09:43,003
You'll come on the picnic
with us, just in case?

948
01:09:45,604 --> 01:09:47,773
I'll go upstairs
and get the pills.

949
01:10:01,621 --> 01:10:03,957
Low tide is three o'clock.

950
01:10:03,989 --> 01:10:06,460
Your mother and I are
gonna go look for clams.

951
01:10:07,194 --> 01:10:10,464
Watch that Lucia doesn't
get dizzy in the cold water.

952
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:12,499
She'll be fine, Father.

953
01:10:18,771 --> 01:10:20,039
You look so severe.

954
01:10:21,474 --> 01:10:22,710
Look closer.

955
01:10:36,855 --> 01:10:38,524
In a trance?

956
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:42,930
I oughta make up my mind.

957
01:10:44,063 --> 01:10:47,000
Fun is good but, love is better.

958
01:10:49,034 --> 01:10:51,037
I'll leave that up to you.

959
01:10:51,871 --> 01:10:52,873
I'll meet you later.

960
01:11:11,157 --> 01:11:13,060
You're exhausted, Louise.

961
01:11:13,859 --> 01:11:16,429
And you're still too
involved with the boys.

962
01:11:17,729 --> 01:11:19,065
I'm not allowed?

963
01:11:20,632 --> 01:11:23,702
Well, I know I can't stop you.

964
01:11:23,735 --> 01:11:26,739
Well then don't. Encourage me.

965
01:11:48,694 --> 01:11:49,729
Look me in the eye.

966
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:10,717
Do you think Miss Childs
is serious about our John,

967
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:12,085
or just playing with him?

968
01:12:12,851 --> 01:12:15,055
I can feel yo
fighting all this.

969
01:12:15,954 --> 01:12:19,525
Though I confess, I don't
know what's to become of us

970
01:12:19,559 --> 01:12:21,028
with Peter and John gone.

971
01:12:23,061 --> 01:12:24,832
Here, take this.

972
01:12:32,171 --> 01:12:33,173
I'm going.

973
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,944
What is it? What do you see?

974
01:13:13,112 --> 01:13:14,780
I'm taking lessons.

975
01:13:15,448 --> 01:13:19,786
I'm learning how a man prepares
himself for being a cuckold.

976
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:24,925
Who are you talking about?

977
01:13:25,858 --> 01:13:27,694
John. He's laughable.

978
01:13:27,726 --> 01:13:29,262
You're so damn rigid.

979
01:13:31,296 --> 01:13:33,032
I know you're hurt, Peter.

980
01:13:34,801 --> 01:13:36,103
But why hurt others?

981
01:13:39,639 --> 01:13:41,275
Your brother
couldn't hope for more.

982
01:13:42,675 --> 01:13:44,344
I'm sure she's perfectly
honorable.

983
01:13:44,377 --> 01:13:46,880
Of course, all women are
honorable,

984
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,882
and all men are cuckolds.

985
01:14:10,802 --> 01:14:12,805
What do you see?

986
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:16,843
I see your face.
How pretty you look.

987
01:14:18,978 --> 01:14:21,881
If that is all you see,
you will miss all of this.

988
01:14:27,819 --> 01:14:29,288
It's what I prefer to look at.

989
01:14:31,056 --> 01:14:33,059
John, you are staring.

990
01:14:34,193 --> 01:14:35,695
You're cruel.

991
01:14:37,963 --> 01:14:39,166
You're stunning.

992
01:14:39,731 --> 01:14:40,833
Stop.

993
01:14:41,634 --> 01:14:44,371
I'm thinking of only one
thing. You.

994
01:14:45,771 --> 01:14:46,706
Will you be quiet?

995
01:14:46,738 --> 01:14:47,873
I love you.

996
01:14:48,573 --> 01:14:50,777
I can no longer hold my peace.

997
01:14:52,712 --> 01:14:54,047
You intoxicate me.

998
01:15:01,787 --> 01:15:06,225
My dear friend, you
are no longer a child,

999
01:15:06,259 --> 01:15:08,261
and I am not a young girl.

1000
01:15:09,462 --> 01:15:13,800
If you have made up your mind
to declare your love for me,

1001
01:15:15,835 --> 01:15:18,005
I assume you wish to make me
your wife.

1002
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,175
Why yes, I do.

1003
01:15:57,176 --> 01:15:58,778
I managed to snag an eel.

1004
01:15:58,810 --> 01:15:59,612
Oh!

1005
01:15:59,645 --> 01:16:02,215
Father will be nearly
vindicated.

1006
01:16:02,247 --> 01:16:03,916
He will not.

1007
01:16:05,251 --> 01:16:06,219
Oh.

1008
01:16:06,252 --> 01:16:07,220
Guess what I've done, Mother.

1009
01:16:07,252 --> 01:16:08,220
I don't know.

1010
01:16:08,253 --> 01:16:09,922
Guess.

1011
01:16:10,989 --> 01:16:13,159
I've told Lucia
I want to marry her.

1012
01:16:14,327 --> 01:16:15,262
Marry her?

1013
01:16:15,295 --> 01:16:18,297
Yes. Don't you think
it's the right thing?

1014
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:23,236
Yes, she's charming.

1015
01:16:24,237 --> 01:16:25,838
Of course.

1016
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:27,774
So you approve then?

1017
01:16:27,806 --> 01:16:29,809
Yes, I, I approve.

1018
01:16:34,279 --> 01:16:36,282
Is she with child?

1019
01:16:36,314 --> 01:16:37,916
Do you mean to say
that you're not pleased?

1020
01:16:37,949 --> 01:16:40,086
No, but I am. I am pleased.

1021
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:45,057
Lucia's not with child,
she barely lets me touch her.

1022
01:16:45,091 --> 01:16:46,293
As it should be.

1023
01:16:48,961 --> 01:16:50,963
What does she say about this?

1024
01:16:51,497 --> 01:16:53,767
I cannot do better, I'm sure.

1025
01:16:54,466 --> 01:16:56,469
You haven't answered my
question.

1026
01:16:56,970 --> 01:17:00,273
She didn't reply. That means
that she's thinking about it.

1027
01:17:00,305 --> 01:17:02,942
Oh , is that what it
means?

1028
01:17:09,148 --> 01:17:11,818
Come, talk to Lucia.

1029
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:13,953
She likes you. Maybe
you can encourage her.

1030
01:17:14,621 --> 01:17:18,091
I'm sure she
gets all the encouragement

1031
01:17:18,123 --> 01:17:19,792
she can manage from you.

1032
01:17:26,932 --> 01:17:27,833
Miss Childs.

1033
01:17:29,402 --> 01:17:32,305
I think I'll see if Peter
and Father have wandered off.

1034
01:17:36,108 --> 01:17:38,110
Do you intend to marry my son?

1035
01:17:38,911 --> 01:17:40,313
I like John.

1036
01:17:41,113 --> 01:17:46,152
I enjoy him, and I
admire his good fortune,

1037
01:17:46,185 --> 01:17:47,788
and his desire to share it.

1038
01:17:49,622 --> 01:17:52,893
He says he loves me, and
he wants to marry me.

1039
01:17:56,061 --> 01:17:57,463
So I will marry him.

1040
01:17:58,463 --> 01:18:00,466
Girls are raised to marry.

1041
01:18:00,934 --> 01:18:05,070
They're not always made to
understand the compromise

1042
01:18:05,104 --> 01:18:06,373
until later.

1043
01:18:07,139 --> 01:18:09,309
Of course we are.

1044
01:18:10,109 --> 01:18:13,146
We sell to the right bidder
and pray for love to follow.

1045
01:18:16,349 --> 01:18:18,351
You were married.

1046
01:18:20,953 --> 01:18:24,490
Betray yourself and you will
find yourself betraying others.

1047
01:18:24,523 --> 01:18:26,458
I understand.

1048
01:18:26,492 --> 01:18:28,161
Good.

1049
01:18:54,587 --> 01:18:56,322
What do you think?

1050
01:18:56,354 --> 01:18:58,357
Gorgeous.

1051
01:19:01,159 --> 01:19:02,528
This is where we'll live.

1052
01:19:03,296 --> 01:19:08,168
Christ almighty.
Truly grand, son.

1053
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,469
Counselor.

1054
01:19:13,305 --> 01:19:17,242
If humanity alone, if our
instinct of natural compassion

1055
01:19:17,275 --> 01:19:19,444
we feel towards all who suffer,

1056
01:19:19,478 --> 01:19:21,648
were the motive for the
acquittal we ask,

1057
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,615
then I shall appeal to your
compassion,

1058
01:19:23,649 --> 01:19:25,418
gentlemen of the jury.

1059
01:19:25,451 --> 01:19:29,288
To your hearts
as fathers and as men.

1060
01:19:29,322 --> 01:19:33,926
But, we have
the law on our side,

1061
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,029
and it is
simply a question of justice

1062
01:19:36,061 --> 01:19:37,697
we shall submit for your
judgment.

1063
01:19:37,729 --> 01:19:39,364
Bravo.

1064
01:19:39,398 --> 01:19:41,400
What about
women at the jury?

1065
01:19:42,734 --> 01:19:45,505
How well my
voice carries in this room.

1066
01:19:50,176 --> 01:19:52,178
Would you like a little tour?

1067
01:19:56,582 --> 01:19:58,117
Excuse me.

1068
01:20:04,556 --> 01:20:06,559
What do you think?

1069
01:20:07,693 --> 01:20:09,329
Does it please you?

1070
01:20:10,328 --> 01:20:12,998
Yes, it does.

1071
01:20:15,033 --> 01:20:18,003
The bed is so white.

1072
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:20,672
Did you choose this?

1073
01:20:20,706 --> 01:20:22,242
I did.

1074
01:20:24,577 --> 01:20:26,579
Welcome to the family, Lucia.

1075
01:20:32,752 --> 01:20:34,287
I'll leave you.

1076
01:20:57,743 --> 01:21:00,080
Fit for a king, I'd say.

1077
01:21:01,247 --> 01:21:05,085
This has all been such a
delight.

1078
01:21:06,051 --> 01:21:07,252
I will take my leave now.

1079
01:21:08,487 --> 01:21:10,256
Charles. Charles.

1080
01:21:10,288 --> 01:21:12,724
Would you accompany Miss
Childs to her boarding house?

1081
01:21:12,757 --> 01:21:14,293
Ah, yes dear.

1082
01:21:15,261 --> 01:21:16,562
Shall I come back for you?

1083
01:21:16,595 --> 01:21:19,332
No, no.
Peter will see me home.

1084
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,269
- Mother?
- Mm-hmm?

1085
01:21:24,802 --> 01:21:26,706
Would you excuse us?

1086
01:21:26,738 --> 01:21:28,741
Oh, of course.

1087
01:21:34,747 --> 01:21:37,050
The widow
certainly looks all-in.

1088
01:21:37,449 --> 01:21:39,452
The widow?

1089
01:21:40,586 --> 01:21:41,753
What has happened to you?

1090
01:21:41,787 --> 01:21:43,722
You've made quite an
impression.

1091
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:47,727
I'm really getting tired
of your attitude towards me.

1092
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,563
Towards you? How dare you.

1093
01:21:51,729 --> 01:21:53,532
I know that
you're jealous of me.

1094
01:21:53,565 --> 01:21:57,103
Oh, jealous, good lord,
jealous of what?

1095
01:21:57,136 --> 01:21:59,372
Of your looks, of your brains?

1096
01:21:59,404 --> 01:22:00,372
Your apartment?

1097
01:22:00,405 --> 01:22:04,077
It drives you mad that
Lucia prefers me to you.

1098
01:22:04,109 --> 01:22:08,180
Oh really? Jealous of you
and that shrewd little goose?

1099
01:22:08,213 --> 01:22:09,681
You're bursting with jealousy.

1100
01:22:09,715 --> 01:22:10,750
Shut up.

1101
01:22:10,783 --> 01:22:13,219
No, and you torture
Mother as if it's her fault,

1102
01:22:13,252 --> 01:22:14,253
as if everything is.

1103
01:22:14,286 --> 01:22:15,186
Shut up, right now.

1104
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:17,689
No. I've wanted to
tell you what I think.

1105
01:22:17,722 --> 01:22:19,257
I demand a little respect.

1106
01:22:19,291 --> 01:22:20,626
Me, respect you?

1107
01:22:20,658 --> 01:22:22,427
Yes, me!

1108
01:22:22,461 --> 01:22:23,863
Respect you?

1109
01:22:23,895 --> 01:22:26,498
You who's dishonored
us all with your greed.

1110
01:22:28,234 --> 01:22:30,236
What did you say? Greed?

1111
01:22:35,541 --> 01:22:39,846
Go on, dammit. Tell me how I've
dishonored us with my greed.

1112
01:22:39,878 --> 01:22:41,613
I'm saying you don't
accept one man's fortune

1113
01:22:41,646 --> 01:22:44,083
when you're supposed to
be the son of another.

1114
01:22:46,519 --> 01:22:48,253
What'd you say? Say that
again.

1115
01:22:48,287 --> 01:22:50,722
I'm just saying what
everyone else is whispering.

1116
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:55,228
Are you stupid?

1117
01:22:55,261 --> 01:22:59,265
You're the bastard son of the
man who left you the money.

1118
01:23:02,801 --> 01:23:04,804
Here's your father, Leon
Marshall.

1119
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:15,314
No man with any respect
would accept the money.

1120
01:23:16,448 --> 01:23:18,451
Not when
it dishonors their mother.

1121
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:26,493
Peter, please. Please,
let's discuss this.

1122
01:23:28,594 --> 01:23:30,395
Peter help me.

1123
01:23:30,429 --> 01:23:32,832
I am a swine to
have told you this.

1124
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:06,466
Sit down.

1125
01:24:17,643 --> 01:24:19,645
What Peter said is true.

1126
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:23,182
Why lie about it?

1127
01:24:24,984 --> 01:24:27,520
You wouldn't believe me if I
denied it.

1128
01:24:30,389 --> 01:24:31,724
Hush.

1129
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,569
I have nothing more to say.

1130
01:24:43,969 --> 01:24:46,338
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

1131
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:48,641
I don't know.

1132
01:24:50,643 --> 01:24:51,844
Mother.

1133
01:24:52,211 --> 01:24:54,646
Well,
what, what? John, John.

1134
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,349
You will not go.

1135
01:24:58,317 --> 01:25:02,454
I love you.

1136
01:25:02,488 --> 01:25:03,322
Oh it's impossible.

1137
01:25:03,355 --> 01:25:06,358
Tomorrow, even
you will not forgive me.

1138
01:25:07,493 --> 01:25:09,596
How can I live
between the two of you?

1139
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:12,832
Of course you can.

1140
01:25:14,065 --> 01:25:15,635
How can I avoid
thinking of this

1141
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:18,670
when I see you
and your brother every day?

1142
01:25:20,338 --> 01:25:22,041
It does not matter.

1143
01:25:22,073 --> 01:25:23,875
But you would think of it.

1144
01:25:27,011 --> 01:25:31,016
My child,
we must try to be calm.

1145
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:38,390
If I were to hear, even once,

1146
01:25:38,423 --> 01:25:40,426
what I heard from your brother,

1147
01:25:41,659 --> 01:25:44,896
if I was to see in your
eyes what I read in his,

1148
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:46,798
- I will be gone.
- Stop.

1149
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:53,905
You don't have to forgive me.

1150
01:25:54,338 --> 01:25:56,676
There's nothing so
wounding as forgiveness.

1151
01:25:59,345 --> 01:26:01,881
But you must owe me no ill
will for what I have done.

1152
01:26:03,782 --> 01:26:05,518
You must be
strong enough to accept

1153
01:26:05,551 --> 01:26:07,720
that you are not Charles' son,

1154
01:26:07,752 --> 01:26:11,690
without blushing and without
despising me.

1155
01:26:14,426 --> 01:26:15,762
You must say to yourself

1156
01:26:16,529 --> 01:26:20,566
that although I was
your father's mistress,

1157
01:26:20,599 --> 01:26:24,337
I was more truly his wife.

1158
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:39,418
Before God, I love no one
but him and you two boys.

1159
01:26:46,492 --> 01:26:48,895
Stay, Mother.

1160
01:26:52,898 --> 01:26:54,900
I can be with you.

1161
01:26:56,167 --> 01:26:58,036
At least for tonight.

1162
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:10,682
That is out of the question.

1163
01:27:19,524 --> 01:27:21,860
Come, I will take you home.

1164
01:27:37,042 --> 01:27:39,045
I won't share it with anyone.

1165
01:27:39,845 --> 01:27:42,048
I don't know
what's happening to me.

1166
01:27:43,082 --> 01:27:47,052
There was this kid in torn
clothes, trying to walk,

1167
01:27:47,085 --> 01:27:48,755
but he'd fall down.

1168
01:27:49,654 --> 01:27:54,860
And he'd get back up,
like this island boy

1169
01:27:55,694 --> 01:27:59,398
at Cold Harbor, where
artillery shot cut him in half.

1170
01:27:59,966 --> 01:28:01,200
You'd had this before?

1171
01:28:01,233 --> 01:28:03,101
Never like this.

1172
01:28:05,237 --> 01:28:09,574
My heart beats like it's going
to pound through my chest.

1173
01:28:11,976 --> 01:28:14,447
What about
your wife? Have you told her?

1174
01:28:17,949 --> 01:28:19,152
She left.

1175
01:29:01,993 --> 01:29:03,662
May I come in?

1176
01:29:07,899 --> 01:29:09,902
Do you think me a wretch?

1177
01:29:18,577 --> 01:29:20,246
What's the
matter with your eye?

1178
01:29:26,118 --> 01:29:28,287
What did you and mother say
to each other after I left?

1179
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:32,591
Nothing.
Mama and I sorted linens.

1180
01:29:33,992 --> 01:29:35,628
I somehow doubt that's all-

1181
01:29:35,661 --> 01:29:36,996
Peter.

1182
01:29:39,064 --> 01:29:42,502
Since I am
the son of this other man,

1183
01:29:43,469 --> 01:29:47,239
since I know it and
accept it, is only natural

1184
01:29:47,271 --> 01:29:49,140
I should accept his fortune.

1185
01:29:50,307 --> 01:29:54,980
Since I'm not the son of the
man I believed to be my father,

1186
01:29:57,149 --> 01:29:59,151
I can accept nothing from him.

1187
01:30:00,118 --> 01:30:04,123
Neither now, nor after he
dies. It would not be right.

1188
01:30:09,795 --> 01:30:13,164
I shall renounce all claims
to the family inheritance,

1189
01:30:13,198 --> 01:30:15,201
and leave it to you.

1190
01:30:15,501 --> 01:30:17,036
It is only right.

1191
01:30:18,103 --> 01:30:22,207
It is also just that I keep
the money from my own father.

1192
01:30:22,975 --> 01:30:25,110
If I were to
refuse my father's money,

1193
01:30:25,143 --> 01:30:29,247
it would only invite hardship,
which would serve no one.

1194
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,949
I understand, John.

1195
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:36,322
Good, which brings
me to the next matter.

1196
01:30:36,587 --> 01:30:37,989
What is that?

1197
01:30:38,023 --> 01:30:39,692
It's a delicate point.

1198
01:30:40,926 --> 01:30:41,994
It involves your presence here.

1199
01:30:42,027 --> 01:30:44,296
And in the family. Is
that what you're suggesting?

1200
01:30:44,328 --> 01:30:45,130
Not at all.

1201
01:30:45,162 --> 01:30:47,198
That now that
I am the sole heir,

1202
01:30:47,231 --> 01:30:49,234
I should leave
the Roland family?

1203
01:30:50,702 --> 01:30:52,704
You should leave
the island, Peter.

1204
01:30:53,538 --> 01:30:56,274
Your presence hangs like
a cloud over everyone,

1205
01:30:57,274 --> 01:30:58,944
most of all, you.

1206
01:31:02,113 --> 01:31:05,250
There's a schooner, a freight
schooner, leaving for Boston,

1207
01:31:05,283 --> 01:31:07,853
and then Baltimore.

1208
01:31:07,886 --> 01:31:10,789
I know the captain, and
I'm prepared to provide you

1209
01:31:10,822 --> 01:31:12,224
with the funds
you'll need for six months

1210
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:14,926
in either city as you
work to set yourself up.

1211
01:31:16,895 --> 01:31:18,230
John.

1212
01:31:19,864 --> 01:31:21,199
No.

1213
01:32:42,247 --> 01:32:44,250
Good morning.

1214
01:32:44,649 --> 01:32:46,719
Good morning.

1215
01:32:46,752 --> 01:32:48,887
Are you not
coming down to eat?

1216
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:51,257
There is a
great deal for me to do,

1217
01:32:52,890 --> 01:32:55,960
because I see
now that you were right.

1218
01:32:55,993 --> 01:32:57,328
Yes?

1219
01:32:59,463 --> 01:33:01,432
It is time for me to leave
this house.

1220
01:33:01,466 --> 01:33:03,235
It no longer feels like a home.

1221
01:33:03,268 --> 01:33:06,771
And these people who no
longer feel like my family,

1222
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:10,376
we are bound by
the thinnest of threads.

1223
01:33:11,176 --> 01:33:14,046
I torture you and Mother
with my mere presence.

1224
01:33:14,746 --> 01:33:17,949
And clearly, I torture myself.

1225
01:33:22,154 --> 01:33:23,122
It is unbearable.

1226
01:33:26,224 --> 01:33:27,426
We'll wait for you.

1227
01:33:29,426 --> 01:33:32,029
Is she, is Mother down there?

1228
01:33:32,063 --> 01:33:34,065
Yes. She sent me to fetch you.

1229
01:33:36,467 --> 01:33:38,470
Very well, I will come down.

1230
01:34:13,137 --> 01:34:15,506
It's a handsome schooner
that's come into port.

1231
01:34:15,539 --> 01:34:19,278
It's the Tyrone. Life is
very pleasant on these ships.

1232
01:34:19,310 --> 01:34:20,311
Hm.

1233
01:34:20,345 --> 01:34:22,347
I am planning
to sail with her.

1234
01:34:23,314 --> 01:34:25,317
What on earth do you mean?

1235
01:34:25,884 --> 01:34:27,152
I spoke to the purser

1236
01:34:27,185 --> 01:34:30,088
and I will sail
with her on Thursday.

1237
01:34:30,121 --> 01:34:32,123
I have my heart set on it.

1238
01:34:33,024 --> 01:34:34,360
Is this true?

1239
01:34:35,292 --> 01:34:36,828
Louise?

1240
01:34:38,395 --> 01:34:40,231
All the
arrangements have been made.

1241
01:34:40,265 --> 01:34:44,269
Well, huh, then perhaps
you can take me on board.

1242
01:34:44,301 --> 01:34:46,537
I've been wanting to see
the insides of that boat.

1243
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:47,905
Certainly I will.

1244
01:34:47,939 --> 01:34:49,441
Have you got money, Peter?

1245
01:34:51,408 --> 01:34:52,376
I have sold my watch.

1246
01:34:52,409 --> 01:34:53,478
I'm happy to give you-

1247
01:34:53,511 --> 01:34:55,047
I'll be fine.

1248
01:34:55,079 --> 01:34:57,515
Are you sure
that you have enough?

1249
01:34:58,216 --> 01:35:01,453
What of all your plans?
What's to become of them?

1250
01:35:02,554 --> 01:35:04,556
I'll work on board.

1251
01:35:05,422 --> 01:35:07,259
I'll make new plans.

1252
01:35:07,292 --> 01:35:09,295
Hm, what do you think Louise?

1253
01:35:13,564 --> 01:35:15,433
I think that Peter is right.

1254
01:35:17,435 --> 01:35:20,439
Why, I'm happy you agree.
I know John does too.

1255
01:35:21,338 --> 01:35:22,640
Father?

1256
01:35:22,673 --> 01:35:24,576
In a couple of years
you'll have a practice

1257
01:35:24,609 --> 01:35:26,912
and some money,
and you'll be on your way.

1258
01:35:26,944 --> 01:35:29,413
Will you promise to write,
Peter?

1259
01:35:29,447 --> 01:35:33,152
No, thank you, Josephine.
I'm too nervous this morning.

1260
01:35:36,954 --> 01:35:38,289
Hm, well.

1261
01:35:44,029 --> 01:35:45,464
Excuse me, everyone.

1262
01:36:12,157 --> 01:36:17,162
So, Mama, will you come
with me to calm Lucia?

1263
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:23,534
Yes.

1264
01:36:31,542 --> 01:36:33,077
Yes, I will come.

1265
01:36:40,251 --> 01:36:43,221
I think I'll gather some
flowers from the greenhouse.

1266
01:37:11,382 --> 01:37:14,686
You see, Peter was quite
ready and willing to go away.

1267
01:37:16,787 --> 01:37:18,323
Poor boy.

1268
01:37:20,391 --> 01:37:22,693
Why do you say, "Poor boy?"

1269
01:37:22,726 --> 01:37:25,029
He will be happy
onboard the schooner.

1270
01:37:25,729 --> 01:37:27,332
No, I know.

1271
01:37:51,523 --> 01:37:53,559
I have things to take care of
upstairs.

1272
01:38:10,475 --> 01:38:12,778
Well, you'll be
needing some things.

1273
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:15,046
But I'm at a bit of a loss.

1274
01:38:15,079 --> 01:38:17,248
I ordered your underwear,

1275
01:38:17,282 --> 01:38:21,386
and I went to the tailor for
the rest of your clothes.

1276
01:38:25,222 --> 01:38:26,658
But, do you need anything else?

1277
01:38:27,658 --> 01:38:29,661
No. Nothing else.

1278
01:38:30,595 --> 01:38:32,798
Maybe things that I haven't
thought of?

1279
01:38:32,831 --> 01:38:34,699
No, thank you.

1280
01:38:37,335 --> 01:38:38,737
It's all done.

1281
01:39:27,185 --> 01:39:28,520
Hello?

1282
01:39:31,488 --> 01:39:33,157
I hope we're not too late.

1283
01:39:33,824 --> 01:39:35,493
We want to
spend some time with you.

1284
01:39:35,527 --> 01:39:36,795
Step inside.

1285
01:39:45,869 --> 01:39:48,606
You don't get
much air down here.

1286
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:56,581
Well, you even
have your own pharmacy.

1287
01:39:56,613 --> 01:39:59,484
Maybe I'll be called
upon to help someone.

1288
01:39:59,817 --> 01:40:01,319
Yeah.

1289
01:40:08,225 --> 01:40:09,862
Ah, sooner than I thought.

1290
01:40:10,328 --> 01:40:11,829
Well, we best be going.

1291
01:40:12,396 --> 01:40:14,699
But must we? Already?

1292
01:40:17,702 --> 01:40:20,305
Sounds like
she's about to sail.

1293
01:40:20,337 --> 01:40:21,806
Well, goodbye son.

1294
01:40:22,974 --> 01:40:24,676
Heh. Let's go.

1295
01:40:50,467 --> 01:40:52,537
I thought Lucia might come.

1296
01:40:53,537 --> 01:40:54,872
You look disappointed.

1297
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:58,443
Will you say goodbye for me?

1298
01:41:01,011 --> 01:41:03,414
Have you made plans?

1299
01:41:03,448 --> 01:41:04,783
We know what we'd like.

1300
01:41:07,784 --> 01:41:09,787
We'll have
a lot to talk about.

1301
01:42:55,049 --> 01:43:00,049
