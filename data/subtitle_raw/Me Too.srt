1
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,639
"It's like the human body."

2
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,529
"What would the body without
its members?"

3
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,398
"Yes, they're fragile."

4
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,657
Come on, pulses, only the pulses.

5
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,178
"For those companies
that divide and alienate minorities rs"

6
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,775
"Societies're mutilated."

7
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,179
They're not united.
Each seems a desert island.

8
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,811
"And arms, come Joseph
started, okay?"

9
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,170
Okay, Rosario, very well,
open up front and the side.

10
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,649
Do not want this,
rather, we want marriage.

11
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,933
Here there's no women or blacks,
nor homosexuals, nor anything.

12
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,334
Here we are all people.

13
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,134
Therefore, work helps us

14
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:46,649
us to feel part of society,
because we are,

15
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,813
always were, and we have a voice
this society

16
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,970
a democratic society.
Thank you.

17
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,272
Daniel? Hello
Consuelo Jim閚ez.

18
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,420
Okay?

19
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,810
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

20
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:28,571
Come on, I show you where
work, okay?

21
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,747
We are very pleased
to have him with us.

22
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:32,814
Another thing that I tell...

23
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,936
that there is one on your desk phone,
that my extension is 25,

24
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,172
and so I do not get confused
I put my name, Consuelo.

25
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,253
"Good morning. Okay?"

26
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,533
"Okay, good morning.
"Look,

27
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,132
Pepe, our psychologist, who will
explain the entire computer system.

28
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,917
- Whatever you need.
Thank you.

29
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:52,348
- How you doing, champ?
Very well.

30
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,949
Do not worry so wolf around,
I am your pastor!

31
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,655
"She is Rocio, our veteran.
Star."

32
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:02,693
"And she's Macarena, our little princess."

33
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,214
"Macarena is to help, like you."

34
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,954
You will sit at the table.

35
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,455
And we miss Laura, who is there.

36
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:12,591
So we have work accumulated.

37
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,796
What studying, teaching?

38
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,016
"And psychology."

39
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,738
Anyway, is proud to have such a phenomenon
you are here among us. Is not everybody?

40
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,417
Sure.

41
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,456
Secretariat for Persons with
Special Needs?

42
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,652
A moment that step.

43
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,004
"Concentrate your intelligence
in front of you."

44
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:18,489
"You will feel a slight vibration,"

45
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,292
"A slight sensation of heat
produced by the movement."

46
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,412
"Soothe tension, relax the ligaments
this part of your body"

47
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,602
"And put yourself in a state of
deep relaxation."

48
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:38,540
"More and deeper each time."

49
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,396
"Concentrate your intelligence eyelids
and tissues surrounding them."

50
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,608
Hello!

51
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:46,793
You lost?

52
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:48,577
The public attendance
is not here.

53
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,256
Triana has to go.
Come alone or with your parents?

54
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:53,678
No, I came alone.

55
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
Yeah, that is...

56
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,594
Oh, I've been here? Documentation
to prepare the folders.

57
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,118
Well I see you already know.
Daniel Sanz.

58
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,675
Daniel Sanz...

59
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,998
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Sorry?

60
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,828
Seville, a day of work...

61
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,314
within an hour meet
technical committees. So you know...

62
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,452
I sit there.

63
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,271
Yeah, right, I do not know
but that's the truth.

64
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,350
It's Sad But it's true.
Oh, my God, hold on.

65
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,759
It was not this.

66
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,998
No...
It was not this.

67
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,579
It had to be beige, which is young,
this is old.

68
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,939
- This is more beautiful and will love.
Bonito-nothing, Bernab?

69
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,352
You have no taste whatsoever.

70
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,589
My goodness, that cool! That elegant.
I look like a minister.

71
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,677
Everything comes with time, my son,
will have to point higher.

72
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,593
A Toast by his first workday.

73
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,071
Just need to get married.

74
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,811
Saw the video I sent them the new
Metro Sevilla?

75
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,792
For me it was the car.
Will have a station in the square.

76
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,223
- You will ride the subway?
- Man, of course.

77
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,317
In my opinion none of Seville
should ride the subway.

78
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,592
"This will fill the mold.
I even fear."

79
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,209
Laura.

80
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,436
Thanks, Star.
He finished his report to the committee?

81
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,792
I'm still correcting
Councillor's speech, right?

82
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,339
Macarena, can you help her?

83
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,932
Is that... I do not have
no time to compensate.

84
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:19,394
Well, today is Friday
and not finished.

85
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,912
If you want to help you get
and invite you to eat.

86
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,151
I'd rather die of hunger, Pepe.

87
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,113
Look at the sympathy of the princess!

88
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,069
Daniel, do not pass me the links
I'll have a coffee.

89
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,879
The copier is damaged,
know where there is another?

90
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,998
Has a left to get out now...
and your will see a lift.

91
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,210
You go up... goes into it, huh?

92
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,193
And rises to the top floor.
E... leaves the elevator,

93
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,988
and finds a very long corridor,
Too long, too long,

94
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:04,759
Is picking up?

95
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,591
Very long.

96
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,642
Let's see, leaves the elevator,

97
00:09:08,643 --> 00:09:12,552
long corridor, comprid韘simo
until the end that ends in...

98
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,792
on a ladder...

99
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,133
And it came to Seville?

100
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,695
Because I was tired of Madrid,
and because I have no family.

101
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,534
It is an orphan?
And I do not have any brothers?

102
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,571
No, I have no brothers.

103
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,859
Therefore this expression on the lips
so... so sad.

104
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,538
I'm not sad.

105
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:02,776
I came here to work for 18 years
the stewardess on the "Expo"

106
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,774
Seville because I thought it was the beach.
Turns out the beach we are 100 kms.

107
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,369
A 125 exactly.

108
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,139
Damn!

109
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,571
Well, I think it will be given
well with us.

110
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,772
Because Sonsoles, that you replace
have depression,

111
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,096
it seems that your son... I do not know,
he was born with a brain injury...

112
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:34,179
Ask your mom to buy
shoes without shoelaces, okay?

113
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,460
Okay.

114
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,715
Hello Laura, what will it be?

115
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,765
A Parmesan...

116
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,969
A traditional...

117
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,638
You got it...

118
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:46,139
And that...

119
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,402
- Fish.
- No, no, this.

120
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,475
- Peach?
- No.

121
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,560
This.

122
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:51,655
Pineapple.

123
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,217
Something more?
- No.

124
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,679
3.70.
And now you, what will?

125
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,432
"I'll have
quarter of sausage."

126
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:04,233
1 / 4 of sausage.

127
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,723
Leaving 1 / 4 of sausage.

128
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,752
Put one dose.

129
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,320
<i>"Blacks are your black eyes,"</i>

130
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,552
<i>"his pen and his black hair,"</i>

131
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,228
<i>"Blacks are the ones I like,"</i>

132
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,712
<i>"blacks that give me poison ..."</i>

133
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,133
Wait a minute.

134
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,349
<i>Very good, very good class,
okay? Goodbye.</i>

135
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,812
Guys! One moment, they're the times
the academy. Everyone stay.

136
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,499
These are the times of the gym
to do pilates or tai chi.

137
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:31,053
Swimming is Wednesday,
I said Wednesday.

138
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:32,723
Let...

139
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,975
Already out?
Here, here Sly.

140
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,870
I gave a discount. Even think that
"The Garden of Earthly Delights"

141
00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:04,299
was a park.

142
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,376
And because they spoke about the
"The Garden of Earthly Delights"?

143
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,726
Because I explained to him about the
framework, the Prado Museum,

144
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,974
it was an allegory sin,

145
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,378
and she is loose a park.

146
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:21,776
I get really crazy.

147
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,593
And well, removing the defects,
what can I do?

148
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,477
Gosh, Dad.
I asked you a Coke Light.

149
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,212
But that's what your mom drinks.

150
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,632
It has to be strong,
we will do everything possible

151
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,074
What?

152
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,952
Is blocked.

153
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,534
Well ..

154
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:40,348
Let's see.
Look, you have to close here, okay?

155
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:46,613
And after each little window should open,
this and this... and this.

156
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,534
You see, this is very easy.

157
00:14:52,402 --> 00:14:53,869
Any LORP does.

158
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,097
If even I'm a LORP.
See?

159
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,492
"Look, just...
- Laura!"

160
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:01,872
Please, I want answer this.

161
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,112
Encarni, so have the resolution
with the degree of dependence,

162
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,312
Peter give the center a day,
a home or whatever.

163
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Hello

164
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,990
My partner takes the data
and makes you a plug.

165
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:13,210
Even more, Encarni.

166
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:15,897
But in a moment.
That was not what I thought.

167
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,839
My brother can not stay on the street,

168
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,040
since my mom died
he only lives down the street.

169
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,919
But woman, do not worry
because there will be room

170
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,152
It's like I had told him,
that it should wait a bit.

171
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,609
It's hard to tell how long
or send me somewhere else.

172
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,653
It's nothing... Do what I say and follow
the procedure and ready.

173
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,057
Hey, do not stay down now wife,
it'll help.

174
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,996
Listen, and why
not occupy a seat extra?

175
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,470
As an extra seat?

176
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,639
If you are unoccupied 24 hours a day
could occupy an extra seat.

177
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,588
You can not occupy a seat extra
vague because there's extra

178
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,316
There is a waiting list and a lot
people need

179
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,056
and we will do our best.
Right?

180
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:04,555
Pepe, please answer the Encarni.

181
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,718
A water?

182
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,676
It's not forbidden to come up here?

183
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,919
Yes ..
I climb when I get mad at the rules.

184
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,550
Once the law... made a trap.

185
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,032
Is it good?

186
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,475
This... I'm not going to want more,
if you like...

187
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,795
Look, it's authentic, pretty,

188
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,390
works perfectly, is fun,

189
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,654
is happy with that force,
with that...

190
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:35,960
vitality, with that... uf!
My,

191
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,789
and how... As it turned out,
shit!

192
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,232
"Hello?"

193
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,916
<i>"Laura... I am Nuria, his sister,
Quique's wife."</i>

194
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,078
<i>"I'm calling because his father is
15 days in hospital and is very serious,"</i>

195
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,716
<i>"gets in touch with us,"</i>

196
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,399
<i>"if you do not want to talk
to his brothers... Call me,"</i>

197
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,238
<i>"Look, my number is 675745695,"</i>

198
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,150
<i>"I need to talk to you...
is important."</i>

199
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,392
HATE... STANDARDS.

200
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:24,239
Cute.

201
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,613
How cute.

202
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,292
Daniel... What?
For eleven times already called me?

203
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,751
<i>I was worried,
why not come to work,</i>

204
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,071
<i>feared he was sick or happened
something serious, I dunno.</i>

205
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,197
What was that?

206
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,550
Knows "Danza Mobile?"

207
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,590
Okay, okay. For further,
not going to be watching TV all day.

208
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,598
Thanks, I did not know more
what to do,

209
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,315
Look do more shifts at the bar, and paid
what you need, okay?

210
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,156
Peter is invited, no need
pay anything, right?

211
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,793
Pay attention, he is invited
because there's no vacancy, ok?

212
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,159
Thank you.

213
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,312
Staff, came a new companion.
Let's get him?

214
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,271
Is called Peter, loves dancing, and will
stay with us year round.

215
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,391
So something is going to dance?

216
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,630
Then come

217
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:46,294
Let's see who dance with Peter.
Some voluntary, come on.

218
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,818
Come, come, dancing.

219
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,095
I'll take you to a nightclub.

220
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:16,699
I do not like disco, I prefer
dinner in a quiet and talk.

221
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,895
And do not get tired of talking so much?

222
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,372
Your hair is beautiful.

223
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,734
What was that?

224
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,011
What has the hair very silky.

225
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,453
Silky?

226
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,092
What color is your hair?

227
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,453
You do not like that, or what?

228
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,096
Yes I adore, is very beautiful.

229
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,417
His is a little creepy, huh?

230
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,934
"The happiness."

231
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,075
The happiness.

232
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,832
"Which produced this reply."

233
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,594
Which produced this reply.

234
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,869
"Was such."

235
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,029
Was such.

236
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,149
"As He HAD Probably."

237
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,913
Probably he HAD to.

238
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,109
"Never felt before."

239
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,349
Never felt before.

240
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,595
This.

241
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,110
And he the expressed himself...

242
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,952
Daniel, where you are with your head?
Where is your head?

243
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,229
"The sensibly."

244
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,489
An sensibly.

245
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,635
"The sensibly."

246
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,749
The sensibly...

247
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,939
"And the warmly."

248
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,940
And the warmly.

249
00:25:33,941 --> 00:25:35,069
This... "As a man."

250
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
As a man.

251
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:37,449
"Violently."

252
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,510
Violently...

253
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,116
"In love ..."
Dani, anybody there?

254
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,391
Daniel please
listen to your mother, please.

255
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,672
This.
"Can Be's suppossed to."

256
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,775
Daniel.
Take an umbrella.

257
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,777
Ah, thanks, Mom.

258
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,017
- Sure.
"Hello.

259
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,778
"Hello.
Thank you."

260
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,014
Well, have fun.

261
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,892
"All right.
Thank you."

262
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,058
And be careful on the road,
okay?

263
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,095
Is.

264
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,612
Do not forget the belt!

265
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,832
Where we go with a melon?

266
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,132
What a beautiful day!

267
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,937
They're chubby, no?

268
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,955
Yeah, well, this is a trait
Down's syndrome, a characteristic.

269
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,018
We have over other
characteristics, you know?

270
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,799
For example the palate,
is narrower.

271
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,299
This also affects Condo speech
because it can...

272
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:41,210
in his tongue, and is
very difficult to speak.

273
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,511
Why is it... so?

274
00:28:46,512 --> 00:28:48,413
- Like what?
- So...

275
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,852
Why is it smart?

276
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,342
In my case it is because my mom

277
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,654
talked a lot with me,
from small,

278
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,413
we were talking
history, politics,

279
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,415
asked me many things,

280
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,780
and I answered.

281
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:17,299
And as my mom saw that I understood
what she was saying,

282
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,656
decided that I was to college.

283
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:25,493
She did everything I was
to college, my mother.

284
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,472
I think it was traces
or something light.

285
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,956
No, nothing like that.

286
00:29:30,998 --> 00:29:34,302
I have Down syndrome
toes to your head,

287
00:29:34,303 --> 00:29:36,695
No... whole, entire.

288
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,055
And often say that there
two ages,

289
00:29:40,056 --> 00:29:42,331
chronological and mental.
I do not think.

290
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,250
I am 34 years...

291
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,058
tie my shoelaces and I know
since 10 years.

292
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:06,698
And the nose?
His nose is flat, Daniel.

293
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,452
For it is another feature
Down's syndrome.

294
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,138
Want to pass the guard?

295
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,568
"Are you with me.
"Are you?

296
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,094
Is.

297
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,472
What geladinho!

298
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,909
This is you?

299
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,159
What do you want, "fusilli" three cheeses
or Spaghetti "carbonara"?

300
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,680
Ah, but they're the envelope?

301
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,480
Yes of course, are from the envelope.

302
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,952
Drugs, oil!

303
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,392
Ay, ay, ay!

304
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,431
What was

305
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,792
I pity him who is an orphan.

306
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:03,037
I'm not an orphan.
I have a father... and two brothers.

307
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,912
But do not you talk to them
for years, you know?

308
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,672
And why lie?

309
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,302
Because...

310
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,958
For me, it's like were dead.

311
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,115
Too bad it gives me.

312
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,272
Daniel please listen...

313
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,672
Do not cry...

314
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,992
Ouch...

315
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,772
Ouch... my boy!
Ouch...

316
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,559
Macarena, there's nothing to understand,
she is teasing

317
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,591
and leave you wanting,
it already is.

318
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,995
Like you.

319
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,292
Yeah, like me,
and the entire service.

320
00:33:05,293 --> 00:33:07,168
Must be the only one who did not
knows her home.

321
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:09,036
By this the boy stepped forward.

322
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,430
Pepe, each has what he deserves.

323
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,831
All day with the boy.

324
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,272
Poor, really,
must pass a cut on her hand...

325
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,795
It's a girl distraught
it's not normal, you do not realize!

326
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,132
If she works in the Secretariat
is a normal girl.

327
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,316
Well, because the distribution must
being crazy

328
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,075
they should not hire
a girl who gives very bad impression,

329
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,152
as a woman Hair that.

330
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,351
His son is 34 years.
What will you do?

331
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,196
I am well aware
of age who has, Bernab?

332
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,275
But you know very well, the amount
interests merged.

333
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:01,280
That girl, fairly normal,
be interested in a guy like Daniel.

334
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,436
Angeles, his son is an idiot.

335
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,599
You do not have to be stupid
manipulate it.

336
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,956
I did not want a normal child?
Because you do.

337
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,312
And normal people, climb!
At least once in a while, I say.

338
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,690
Could use a word a little more
elegant as it is the "scholar"?

339
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,629
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

340
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,268
Yes, more or less.

341
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,873
And it was like you?

342
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,914
Formed?

343
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,959
Come on, Daniel... Syndrome.

344
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,318
Syndrome... of abstinence?

345
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,110
We eat together?

346
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,718
I can not...
You've marked with a friend, you know?

347
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,593
I will ask one dose, okay?

348
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,358
Is.

349
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,357
Fits me a shot.

350
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,600
Let's see.

351
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:53,188
I know she feels something
for me, I know.

352
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,795
He treats me like nobody
treated me before.

353
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,477
She sees me as, as one
real normal.

354
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:06,231
What I have to say.

355
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,515
Say.

356
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,239
I have to say now.

357
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,314
But the truth is in danger, you should know
they may lose. Understand?

358
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,992
Understand?

359
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,990
Kings and I'll have a drink.

360
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,383
Uncle Will.

361
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,631
That thing.

362
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,032
Am-grandmother!
"Are you happy?"

363
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,630
I can not believe. I'm shocked.
Congratulations, son.

364
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,632
Thanks, Mom.

365
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,598
What do you think Daniel?

366
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,992
Very cool. Genial.
Very good.

367
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,113
You will be the godfather.

368
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,509
Oh, great!

369
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,795
Yes, the godfather.

370
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,468
Come and grandparents.

371
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,198
By the sponsor.

372
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,754
- For the best man!
"And that comes by."

373
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:58,309
And the parents!

374
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,592
By parents.

375
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,792
I am very happy for both.

376
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,614
The Ursula called me from New York,

377
00:37:14,415 --> 00:37:16,669
and invited us to spend
Christmas there...

378
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,709
Guys, have a fine private life.

379
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,349
Kissing, touching and
do whatever you want.

380
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,280
Even they have secrets
for their parents.

381
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,791
But to do this
must be sought privacy.

382
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,194
Privacy...

383
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,278
Exactly.
You should seek a private place.

384
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,956
And school is not a private place.
Here it comes to dance.

385
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,559
Enjoy...

386
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,351
Come here... In the morning can give a
kiss, but no tongue.

387
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,992
You guys see me moored Santi
kissing on the floor?

388
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,180
No.

389
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,050
No...
Let's keep things.

390
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,719
And I want to make a toast,
the beautiful people who work with me.

391
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,076
OLE! OLE!

392
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,312
And do not we freeze the salary!

393
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,432
For the love that will arrive before
menopause. Please.

394
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,338
Hope is the last to die!

395
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,392
That hope!

396
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,115
Having fun?

397
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,514
Very.

398
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,473
I did not have a friend?

399
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,789
What friend?

400
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,992
The poor guy is falling in wordiness
this bitch.

401
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,596
Why do not we go to my house
take the "nightcap"?

402
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,792
Pepe, please!

403
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,376
<i>"You who decided that
not worth your life,"</i>

404
00:40:49,377 --> 00:40:52,192
<i>"was down by always feel bad,"</i>

405
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,159
<i>"which anticipated a future
catastrophic,"</i>

406
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,798
<i>"today bodes
the sexual revolution."</i>

407
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,939
<i>"You decided that your
love has not served,"</i>

408
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,749
<i>"who preferred to mask
their identity,"</i>

409
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,432
<i>"is preparing for the coup
most fantastic ..."</i>

410
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,832
Have you thought about prostitution
ever?

411
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,832
Think women I pay?

412
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,398
To me you're a kitten...
A kitten.

413
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,975
You're that beautiful,
in that dress.

414
00:41:30,076 --> 00:41:33,431
Looks like a real princess.
And I a frog.

415
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,307
Ready.

416
00:41:37,439 --> 00:41:40,317
I'll convert...
In Prince!

417
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,472
Hey, that's my prince!

418
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,918
Damn, this is me troubling.

419
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,978
That's it.

420
00:42:19,022 --> 00:42:21,988
I was tired of look down.

421
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,809
Hey, this...

422
00:42:57,436 --> 00:42:59,117
I go to my house.

423
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,556
Want to accompany you?

424
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,198
No.

425
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,112
This lad is going where?
Hey, where are you?

426
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,549
"I'd enter.
- None."

427
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:52,472
Here one can not enter.
Is no place for you. Leaking...

428
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,611
"But, why is that, Antonio?
"Why not! Trick!

429
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,336
This is for larger 18.

430
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,174
"I am 34 years old.
Problem-yours!"

431
00:44:58,175 --> 00:44:59,596
Whatever.
I'm not there either. Trick!

432
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:00,897
- Let him go!
- No way!

433
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,586
It's too expensive for you.
I have two credit cards, two!

434
00:45:03,587 --> 00:45:07,403
So go buy a present for
your mother. Get out of here!

435
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:10,865
No kid, please do not be so.
You're not gonna go, right?

436
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,919
That's not true!

437
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,589
I'm 34!

438
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,774
I'm not a boy!

439
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,033
I'm a man!

440
00:45:31,756 --> 00:45:35,871
I'm a man!

441
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,605
I'm a man...
And I can go in there if I want.

442
00:45:39,606 --> 00:45:41,371
I'm a man!

443
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,596
See who you are.

444
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,995
Do not open.

445
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,469
Who is it?

446
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,550
Heck, Daniel, what time are these?
Come here.

447
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,837
Look at Daniel...

448
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,600
No woman with 46 chromosomes
will fall for you,

449
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,517
and you do not hand this large,
not going to suffer?

450
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,533
Fall for women to
its power, man.

451
00:46:46,279 --> 00:46:49,276
For thus will not
achieve anything.

452
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,030
Can I sleep here?

453
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,472
They know I never criticized
the work of you,

454
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,071
but the truth is that yesterday came
with signs in the neck.

455
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,695
And signs in the neck you
know what it is?

456
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,515
What else?

457
00:47:27,616 --> 00:47:33,071
Luisa is "excited" enthusiast,

458
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,956
and I do not know how to say no,
she does not know.

459
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,118
E... the boys know.

460
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,798
Good, but Luisa has already
25 years, huh?

461
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,396
No.
Luisa has just 24.

462
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,138
He told her about his dad?

463
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,892
What about it?

464
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,015
Who died.

465
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,753
But if that was clear, Santi.
If the problem is that we have,

466
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,988
the problem is not that they can
distinguish couples dance and truth.

467
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,078
And I do not know if you two
also help.

468
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,651
Hello

469
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,499
Hello

470
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,058
We eat together?

471
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,218
Today my mother did "paella."

472
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,371
Ah... And a coffee?

473
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,086
Now I can not, I have to fix it.

474
00:48:31,237 --> 00:48:33,933
The operator did not come today.

475
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,093
Okay, okay...

476
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,918
Son of a bitch!

477
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:25,672
52% of Spanish men between
40 and 70 suffer from erectile dysfunction.

478
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,915
Where did that come from?

479
00:49:28,116 --> 00:49:29,536
In the paper today.

480
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:33,533
Fortunately I have good genetics.
My father, my grandfather...

481
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,134
I never had problems
in bed, never.

482
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,778
What?

483
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:14,570
Here I am, to give you fire
fire in his veins.

484
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,423
Ay, ay, ay!

485
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,737
This is incredible...

486
00:50:25,641 --> 00:50:28,400
unborn who understands;
the truth is.

487
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,514
Need to make a college
to understand, damn!

488
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,312
Will you say what you have or not?

489
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,716
Oh, Laurinha of my soul,
that is weird!

490
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,791
Out-...
"But how so?

491
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:43,560
- Out!
"I'm gone.

492
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,375
- Out Now!
"I'm gone!"

493
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,013
- Outside of my house!
Go-fight?

494
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,672
Out, out, out!

495
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,937
What's gotten into you, dammit?
Seems a...

496
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,752
"I am again, his sister."

497
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,769
"I'm calling because...
Because his father fell into a coma."

498
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,408
"And doctors need to talk to
guys, the children."

499
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:20,051
"And because I need to know what will happen
with the apartment. Well, you know..."

500
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:26,609
"I do not know, I would like
to know what will. You coming?"

501
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:07,066
Right, and the second well,
and once there, drawn.

502
00:52:07,067 --> 00:52:08,615
Okay?
We repeat

503
00:52:08,616 --> 00:52:09,752
Where is Luisa?

504
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,094
I do not know, Peter.

505
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,656
Crouch, Ignacio,

506
00:52:13,057 --> 00:52:16,992
The girls come, come, go, go.

507
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,475
We get around.

508
00:52:19,476 --> 00:52:21,671
And before stopping look
the companion...

509
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,077
is very important... Carmen,
for everyone.

510
00:52:25,078 --> 00:52:27,427
"Look at the other.
E-Luisa?"

511
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,218
I do not know, Peter.

512
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,534
Join Alejandro, Jose enters

513
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,972
Kings... And Luisa?
It is my dance partner!

514
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:40,490
I do not know! Right?
We stopped a moment.

515
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,495
Until that Peter did not leave here, this
lady says that her daughter's not around.

516
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:47,254
He called the mother of Luisa?

517
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:50,935
I offer you Consuelo Jim閚ez, the
Council for Equality and Social Welfare.

518
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,399
Division of Special Needs.

519
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:57,252
I'm sorry but they're standards.

520
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,221
It's too crowded?

521
00:53:00,121 --> 00:53:01,390
Yes ..

522
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:05,660
Could not leave it on the waiting list,
in an emergency?

523
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,793
Luisa loves me.

524
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,868
So thank you.
Even more.

525
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,554
"Let's get married"...
Together.

526
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,586
You can not decide this,

527
00:53:16,587 --> 00:53:19,692
without the express permission
their parents or guardians.

528
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,859
Why not?
"We are united," you know?

529
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,455
I like Louise.

530
00:53:27,156 --> 00:53:29,930
Can not you see she loves me.

531
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,496
"Happy and I like it."

532
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:43,454
This... Love me, my girl.
And I like going out with her.

533
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,802
Pass me the stapler, Pepe?

534
00:53:46,803 --> 00:53:48,789
Because we're getting married,
why not?

535
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:52,868
United States, an apartment,
love us.

536
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:55,770
Stay with it.

537
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:03,531
I laugh, let's walk, to the movies.
I'm happy with it, you know? "Capico?"

538
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,416
"Hello, good morning.
Good morning."

539
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,109
Daniel need to talk, okay?

540
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,234
After another day?

541
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,054
Well ..
Forget tonight, right?

542
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,655
For what?
To suffer more?

543
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,135
Well, I was drunk.
What can I do?

544
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,072
I'ma pretty big
to understand one out.

545
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,853
Listen, I have not given you an out.

546
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,492
Yes, I walked out because I have
Down's syndrome.

547
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,410
Come, do not use it
to make me feel guilty, right?

548
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,235
He is traveling in mayonnaise.

549
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,607
I thought you liked,

550
00:54:51,898 --> 00:54:53,802
but I guess it is like all
others.

551
00:54:53,947 --> 00:54:54,947
So over.

552
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,749
Okay, tell me that I
looking into the eyes.

553
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,738
Look in my eyes and tell.

554
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,930
Daniel, already given, please.

555
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,104
Stop doing that.

556
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,218
Want to stop playing
the retarded?

557
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:13,768
Miss not tell that to the boy,
not you see who is disabled?

558
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,494
Look, lady closes its beak!
Okay?

559
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,049
And you...

560
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:44,094
It will not be my
friend anymore, or what?

561
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,631
I do not want to be your friend,

562
00:55:46,818 --> 00:55:48,694
want to be your boyfriend.

563
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,015
Daniel, this is not possible.

564
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:56,490
In hindsight,
is not even legal, you know.

565
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:59,852
Right...
I do not think to denounce it.

566
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:06,094
Why me?
You do not know anything about me.

567
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:10,215
Because it makes me feel normal.

568
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,877
That commitment comes with it...

569
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:15,295
And who wants to be a
normal person?

570
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,840
Daniel,

571
00:56:32,278 --> 00:56:33,666
Let's be friends...

572
00:56:33,867 --> 00:56:35,054
Please, Daniel.

573
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,332
Dammit...

574
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,492
"I love you!"

575
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:12,738
Caramba!
Do not make noise.

576
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,537
Bobo!

577
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:19,097
Lola, are you? Coming.

578
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,758
Luisa,

579
00:57:34,759 --> 00:57:37,267
if someone comes to say that I am
inside.

580
00:57:37,368 --> 00:57:38,976
"You heard me, Luisa?"

581
00:57:38,977 --> 00:57:40,638
Yes, mom.

582
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,494
"It will be ready ..."

583
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,815
Luisa...

584
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,830
Luisa?

585
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:06,573
Luisa...

586
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,476
Swapping!

587
00:58:13,377 --> 00:58:14,433
This.

588
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:20,696
They fled up!

589
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,514
Hey, what happened?

590
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,269
Peter and Louise... fled!

591
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,578
- Peter and Luisa fled?
- Yes!

592
00:58:28,579 --> 00:58:31,076
Listen a moment, stay there.

593
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,855
Fled...

594
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,691
I came and told you!
I said,

595
00:58:39,692 --> 00:58:41,021
and you do not believe

596
00:58:41,022 --> 00:58:43,275
now it has.

597
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,675
Easy.

598
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:49,818
Take,
this is not the end of the world.

599
00:58:50,019 --> 00:58:52,796
"Just want to be together.
- Daniel"

600
00:58:52,797 --> 00:58:55,057
University did not were r,
Daniel.

601
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,536
No need to study have needs!

602
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,602
Need, you know the
I got into that shit?

603
00:58:59,603 --> 00:59:01,130
If you are horny masturbation.

604
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,310
But that's not all.

605
00:59:04,101 --> 00:59:07,139
You have company, is Caring,

606
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,578
is to have something.

607
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,733
Blessed be the hour that
gave you attention! Blessed!

608
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,695
Of course,

609
00:59:18,496 --> 00:59:20,691
is very easy for you
saying all this,

610
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:26,213
has a wife,
expecting a child, has it all!

611
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:32,451
Daniel did not make me more guilty
to have what I have.

612
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,734
I do not want to feel bad for
have everything I have.

613
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:47,055
Daniel...

614
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,897
Hey!

615
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:57,812
Ouch! Ouch!

616
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:02,099
Wooh!

617
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,092
Ay, ay, ay!

618
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,972
Wooh!

619
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:14,374
Ay, ay, ay!
"I love you."

620
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:22,850
God damn it, man, what the
problem, what is?

621
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:29,439
What was that?
You're not seeing the blinkers on?

622
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,673
Not fatter.

623
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:52,095
"Tirorariro, tirorariro ..."

624
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,276
Do not worry, we will
find, right?

625
01:01:01,577 --> 01:01:03,652
I take responsibility.

626
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,497
Yes

627
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:49,117
I love the passion, and you?

628
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,573
Must be nice.

629
01:01:50,574 --> 01:01:52,302
As made jelly beans.

630
01:01:52,377 --> 01:01:55,132
I also have berries, banana...

631
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,532
Excuse me.

632
01:01:57,876 --> 01:02:00,151
Daniel, why not call
for your brother?

633
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,379
This is the penis.

634
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,079
And this is the condom.

635
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:25,117
If you press here to get the air.
Yes, okay?

636
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,108
Wait, so.

637
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,999
It's not... penis, sorry...

638
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:38,354
Daniel, is ba-na-na, is eating.
Sorry I speak.

639
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,870
Let's see, here's a banana then,
but has the shape of the penis.

640
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:45,392
That is to eat!
This is not...

641
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,193
Sure, look...

642
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,159
This is a banana,
I know it's a banana.

643
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:53,352
It's ba-na-na, is eating.

644
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:04,251
Luisa... not have to do anything
they do not want, right?

645
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,209
Yes, I do.

646
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,611
Okay.

647
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,056
He is a "lunch"...

648
01:03:13,857 --> 01:03:15,412
My soul...

649
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,490
Please...

650
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:28,818
Little heart... With it...
Love... My soul...

651
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:42,609
And do not cry, please.
Come here.

652
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:50,371
Thanks, Daniel...

653
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,930
Thanks dude.

654
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:37,410
Okay?

655
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:44,535
Daniel, I have to go to Madrid...

656
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,575
I want to tell you something.

657
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,892
Love you, honey.

658
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:19,732
You're Beautiful "pa" me.

659
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:28,580
It was not anything.

660
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,815
"Come on!
"Hey, Peter!

661
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,573
Let cool!

662
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:36,185
Please have dropped his glasses.

663
01:05:36,186 --> 01:05:37,803
Luisa please come, you leave.

664
01:05:37,804 --> 01:05:41,635
Please, son, okay?

665
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,637
Okay even my daughter?
My poppet,

666
01:05:45,638 --> 01:05:48,174
nothing happened,
daughter is not?

667
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,903
But that can not be

668
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:53,051
can not escape that.
It's a girl.

669
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,280
Resolved.

670
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:55,602
How are you?

671
01:05:56,229 --> 01:05:59,330
These things run away from home
is childish.

672
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:00,735
No!

673
01:06:03,236 --> 01:06:04,536
Let me go.

674
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:16,330
I'm not a child, I am a woman.
And that's it.

675
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:23,250
Go "pa" and end there.

676
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:25,674
How is "pa" there?

677
01:06:26,675 --> 01:06:29,809
How so?
Where are you going?

678
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:37,659
Dad... is... dead!

679
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,251
Daughter!

680
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,732
"Daddy is in heaven."

681
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:50,932
Yes my love, Dad is in heaven,
yes my love.

682
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:57,098
I do not know like anyone.
Forgive me.

683
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:03,774
Not true, not at fault.

684
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,192
Taxi!

685
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:14,491
Laura's work more or less
was to control...

686
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:17,539
Correspondence,
both inbound and outbound,

687
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:21,016
Expedients to bring the file
stands there, answering the phone...

688
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:25,054
Because we incorporate
these contributions.

689
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:28,252
And we can draw
the second comprehensive plan of action.

690
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:31,357
I mean, that in order
I'm saying...

691
01:10:31,558 --> 01:10:33,615
In order that I saying,

692
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:37,097
you put me comm,
architecture, housing...

693
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:41,374
Also has to stay with her apron
to enter into the room.

694
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:46,137
Inside there is already a familiar,
but even two people can enter.

695
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:07,059
The doctor told me that
left to suffer.

696
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:15,531
When you sign, so...
The disconnect.

697
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:31,652
Those are the keys to your house.

698
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:35,572
Decided to sell my part.

699
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,937
Can I do anything for you?

700
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:04,452
"Ask me for forgiveness."

701
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:31,508
I like to feel
something more than shit, but I can not.

702
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,530
"You okay?"

703
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:01,056
Calm Mom, I'm not gonna die.

704
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:07,296
I know it's not gonna die.
Hear me, I'll tell you something.

705
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:12,376
The first time I saw you
I thought it was a normal baby.

706
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,551
With his face a little different,
but normal.

707
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:23,116
It was his father who told me we had
had a very special baby.

708
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:27,029
I cried non-stop one week.

709
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,415
Until I said:

710
01:13:28,516 --> 01:13:33,071
"But if it happens to everybody
things, why not me?"

711
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:38,529
And from this moment ever
more pity me.

712
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:45,355
I suppose this broken heart
is the result of such effort,

713
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:49,194
but I want you to know that
not regret.

714
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,414
And why so much effort...

715
01:13:52,081 --> 01:13:54,640
If not be happy?

716
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:00,602
I could not do anything,

717
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:03,553
did not have a choice, you know?

718
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:11,234
And I could not accept me...
This was and how?

719
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:22,314
Forgive me, my love, forgive me.

720
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,796
And!

721
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,675
That's my mom!

722
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:48,889
And that's my mom!

723
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,629
I dance a little,
come on, come on!

724
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,039
Who wants a little bit
of nougat?

725
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,550
It's horrible about it.

726
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,274
There's a phone ringing around.

727
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,472
Lets play, it's Christmas Eve.

728
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,752
Want a nougat?

729
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,831
Come on, a nougat.

730
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,118
"Daniel."

731
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:20,232
Hello Merry Christmas.

732
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,511
How are you, kitty?

733
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,551
With my family, and you?

734
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,179
Well, well...

735
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:28,548
My father died.

736
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,754
I miss you.

737
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,777
I can tell you one thing
because it is Christmas?

738
01:15:38,878 --> 01:15:43,475
They're so intimate and dates
so special...

739
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:47,350
But that enrrol鉶.
SPIT.

740
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:52,854
I love you.

741
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:05,610
Merry Christmas...

742
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:04,258
This is from my dad, right?
Let's play.

743
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,053
The puppy?

744
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:07,325
Well, yes...

745
01:17:07,326 --> 01:17:10,932
Let's save?
So okay.

746
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:17,176
Let's make a larger room,
in the case of visits.

747
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:20,540
As it grew, my goodness.

748
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:21,576
Yes

749
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:26,890
Say how old you have.

750
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,872
I have seven years.

751
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,598
And you know who I am?

752
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:31,994
No.

753
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,913
Is Aunt Laura.

754
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,991
Ready? Very good.
Potato, potato.

755
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:17,997
Potato. Potato.
Ba-ta-ta!

756
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:20,771
Hello

757
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:23,132
Wow!

758
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,411
What a mess! No?

759
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,736
Look, we can go to two places.

760
01:19:47,137 --> 01:19:51,232
One is the Eden
that is wonderful.

761
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,418
But it can also go Hell.

762
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:59,758
If we behave well, go to Eden.

763
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,790
But is led by vice and excesses,

764
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:06,109
self-destructs,

765
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:11,428
if autodegrades.
And the end is going to Hell.

766
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,632
What color is horrible that the
're in Hell...

767
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,420
Sure, why.

768
01:20:17,499 --> 01:20:21,512
Gets bored and goes to Eden
fun in Hell.

769
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,818
Back then it was normal
this theme,

770
01:20:26,019 --> 01:20:30,437
so moralizing about the good,
evil, sin...

771
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:39,039
This is beautiful hair color.

772
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,395
Sure you want to go?

773
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:21,679
To move to gain time,
give me your identity documents.

774
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,074
Correct.

775
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,632
Hello Login?

776
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,836
Yes

777
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,754
Good morning.

778
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,189
Good morning.

779
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,435
Hello ..

780
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,679
On one side the part buyer,

781
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:57,137
DS. Nuria Gonz醠ez and
Enrique Valente. Correct?

782
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,078
And the other part is saleswoman

783
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:05,156
DS. Laura Valente and Mr. Michael Valente.

784
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:11,435
Well, because... begin by signing
the selling party.

785
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:19,735
How cold does at Christmas!

786
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,432
Dona Laura.

787
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,594
I'm happy to see them.

788
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,594
It looks very good.

789
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:49,459
I left home because I
not have a choice.

790
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:53,979
Just wanted to let you know.

791
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:03,660
If you need a little more time
I'll have a coffee...

792
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:05,415
and then continue...
when...

793
01:23:05,416 --> 01:23:07,566
Do not sit.
Let us end it as soon as possible.

794
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,972
No, wait a moment.

795
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:15,936
Laura...

796
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:25,095
His father before going into coma,
you confused me.

797
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:36,211
He asked for forgiveness...
Believing it to be you.

798
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:42,502
And told me everything.

799
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,769
Where do I sign?

800
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,872
Has a tattoo?

801
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:50,352
You like it?
Ever wanted to make one.

802
01:27:51,739 --> 01:27:56,477
The tiger represents strength e...

803
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,512
Well ..

804
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:19,032
If you keep touching me...

805
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,109
Gonna pop rockets.

806
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,716
No need to continue.

807
01:28:52,905 --> 01:28:54,709
And if you do not like me?

808
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:02,992
I... I am so happy now.

809
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:09,593
Being with you is the best thing
happened in my life?

810
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:17,992
Do not be...
Making a penalty?

811
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:27,788
I'm doing...
Because I love you too.

812
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:36,038
I never made love.

813
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,834
Neither do I.

814
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,920
Sex with many men in my life,

815
01:29:44,281 --> 01:29:48,920
but never made love.

816
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:52,512
With many?

817
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:00,154
Neither would fit in this hotel.

818
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,536
For me it does.

819
01:30:09,037 --> 01:30:11,312
I like you as well.

820
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:19,502
Daniel,

821
01:30:19,935 --> 01:30:25,088
if we do, does not mean that
we are lovers.

822
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:32,019
And you should know that if you suffer...

823
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:36,855
You have to conceal all the time and
be happy whenever you see.

824
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:42,323
Need to understand

825
01:30:43,639 --> 01:30:47,337
this, only happen today.

826
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:50,935
Today, nothing more.

827
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:56,393
And nothing less.

828
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:37,176
What time is your train?

829
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:41,029
When I want.

830
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,748
Forgive me but is that...

831
01:33:47,749 --> 01:33:49,076
I have to say.

832
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:53,015
It has green eyes so cute,

833
01:33:53,416 --> 01:33:56,450
that eclipse even the
Pacific Ocean.

834
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:00,093
Thank you.

835
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:02,929
Want lunch?

836
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:05,655
No.

- No?

Sure, a girl as pretty as you,
certainly has a boyfriend.

840
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:18,175
Worse than not.

841
