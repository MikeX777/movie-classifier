1
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:28,930
Who created these horrible
weapons?

2
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:32,411
From there, the war and
carnage started

3
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,491
And the way to a cruel death was open.

4
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:37,973
However,
don't blame this miserable.

5
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:40,845
We're the ones who don't
know how to use what he gave us.

6
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:43,812
To defend ourselves from the
wild animals.

7
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:54,770
The time is coming near

8
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:59,166
and the fatalities

9
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:01,047
with God's will,

10
00:01:01,255 --> 00:01:04,406
will decide, which one of us

11
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:09,085
forgetting of ourselves

12
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:12,687
will cry, because the destiny

13
00:01:13,214 --> 00:01:16,445
will bring  a  cruel and violent death

14
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:19,487
in the worst time of war

15
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,971
to a captain so loyal.

16
00:01:29,412 --> 00:01:33,325
That had only a few shots,
in that war that he commanded

17
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:37,809
to the achievements that we're waiting from him.

18
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:40,287
Because on these days

19
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:43,404
it's normal to trespass people.
Even more using intrigue

20
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:46,559
and politics.

21
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,720
From Your Highness Frederico
Gonzaga, Marquis of Mântua

22
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:01,766
to the Famous
Alfonso D'Este, Duke of Ferrara:

23
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:04,560
SignorJoannino,

24
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:06,838
was brought, yesterday, Mântua

25
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:09,648
To be treated of a leg wound.

26
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:12,959
that he got from a shot fired by the
army of Frendsburg

27
00:02:13,607 --> 00:02:17,043
But the doctors said that he
is between life and death.

28
00:02:30,686 --> 00:02:34,883
It's not enough being loyal,

29
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:38,080
as you are

30
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:41,357
if your good name isn't recognized

31
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:44,598
By our religion and our faith

32
00:02:44,884 --> 00:02:49,116
that we follow since our birth.

33
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:53,399
By the dawn of the day,

34
00:02:53,763 --> 00:02:56,516
he woke up, with a lot of pain.

35
00:02:57,283 --> 00:02:59,751
And, at the time he saw me,

36
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:03,511
he told me to ask Maria, his wife

37
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:06,356
to send his son, Cosimo

38
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,997
And when he was talking,he could feel
the death coming for him,

39
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:12,996
and got sad.

40
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:18,355
He told me to bring his company bed,

41
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,589
so he could die like a soldier.

42
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,509
At this time, his eyes were looking
like glass

43
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,715
And the light gave place to darkness.

44
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:32,832
I heard that even His Holiness became moved.

45
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:35,508
Although he could stop to cry

46
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,949
the tragic fate of SignorJoannino, his nephew,

47
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:43,237
The Holy Priest recognized the evil side
that he had.

48
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:46,748
and that it was bigger than the good side.

49
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:49,872
But we'll not say nothing more about this.

50
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,794
because God found a medicine.

51
00:04:11,195 --> 00:04:14,153
Signor Joanni De'Medici,

52
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:19,709
Captain of the army of His Holiness
Clemente Vll,

53
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,828
became ill, which lasted for 4 days.

54
00:04:25,153 --> 00:04:28,748
and then he died in the land of Grifone.

55
00:04:29,073 --> 00:04:30,825
from a fever.

56
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:35,344
after he got shot in the leg
by a cannonball

57
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:40,106
in Mântua, in the last day of November.

58
00:04:40,752 --> 00:04:43,266
of 1 526.

59
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:49,907
Six days before

60
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,467
German cars!

61
00:05:28,187 --> 00:05:30,337
Throw it on the river!

62
00:05:34,426 --> 00:05:37,623
Today, saturday,

63
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:40,982
joining the army from the
lansquenetes, on the border of Pó,

64
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:44,816
Signor Joanni D'Medici
and his cavalry,

65
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:47,865
rided with such heart

66
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:50,493
that the enemy retreated,

67
00:05:50,824 --> 00:05:53,657
losing several cars of provisions.

68
00:05:56,904 --> 00:05:58,656
General!

69
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:01,975
Captain De'Medici attacked our provision cars!

70
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,057
That demon and his dark group
- Let's maintain the order.

71
00:06:06,463 --> 00:06:08,692
And avoid any confrontation.

72
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:12,620
The reason for this hostility is clear now.

73
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:17,091
Let's avoid losses and cross
the river immediately.

74
00:06:17,422 --> 00:06:19,981
The Elite Forces of Emperor Carlos V,

75
00:06:20,221 --> 00:06:24,260
invaded the country with a infantry
of 18000 men.

76
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:27,813
and they loot a few of our cities.

77
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,137
But they received only half of
their salary

78
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,815
and to make matters worse,

79
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,890
they don't have any artillery.

80
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:45,937
The progression from the German invasion
met with

81
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:50,577
General Della Rovere
and his Pontifical army

82
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:53,891
whose infantry of 8.000 men
and 600 elite men.

83
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:58,135
are preceded by Joanni de'Medici
with 600 armed men

84
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,089
and the same number of cavalry

85
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:03,251
which responsability

86
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:06,647
is to delay the Germans, attacking them,

87
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:11,413
day and night.
And Captain Médici

88
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:13,732
polished all of his weaponry

89
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,212
to surprise the enemy in the darkness.

90
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,084
At first, we're uncertain

91
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:12,763
about which way the Germans took

92
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:15,603
and whey they were 8 miles
away from Mântua,

93
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:18,164
il looked like they wanted to
cross the river

94
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:21,406
in Bogoforte or San Nicolo Po.

95
00:08:23,248 --> 00:08:25,557
But in that part of the river

96
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:28,004
there were no more bridges

97
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:31,120
so, they have a bad time crossing it

98
00:08:31,807 --> 00:08:36,244
So, they stopped.

99
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,793
The bridge fell.

100
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:52,203
The soldiers of the pontifical army
had cut the ropes.

101
00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:56,959
The supreme German Commander,
General Frundsberg,

102
00:08:57,444 --> 00:08:59,719
was in a hurry to go back to Rome

103
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:03,559
because he had trained his soldiers
to kill the priests

104
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,632
and to stole the wealth of the Church.

105
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:11,522
He had a gold rope that was always
with him.

106
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:16,479
Claiming he was going to hang
the Pope with it!

107
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,190
Prepare yourselves for an urgent message.

108
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,511
A messenger!

109
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,155
Prepare the messenger to leave.

110
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,195
A message to Captain De'Medici!

111
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,237
We have to expel Frundberg

112
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,677
before he crosses the river,
and opens his way to Parma.

113
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:53,227
If he refuses to fight us,
it's because he wants to go back to Rome.

114
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,950
In the middle of the winter, he won't
find neither food nor amunition.

115
00:09:58,238 --> 00:10:00,706
He now how to find it.
That Luteran!

116
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:03,907
Not for a long time.

117
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:08,227
To Francesco Maria Della Rovere,
Duke of Urbino,

118
00:10:08,757 --> 00:10:11,191
Supreme Commander
of the Pontifical Army.

119
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:22,152
It looks to me

120
00:10:22,395 --> 00:10:26,149
that the Italian army,
not being disciplined,

121
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:29,744
and don't obeying any orders,

122
00:10:30,794 --> 00:10:33,354
our infantry can't

123
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:38,104
take the attack

124
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:41,781
of the German Army

125
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:44,509
Although that army

126
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:47,910
doesn't have artillery

127
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:50,828
And it would be better

128
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,705
to attack

129
00:10:53,032 --> 00:10:55,341
this army of lansquenetes

130
00:10:55,592 --> 00:10:57,822
through skirmish and sudden attacks,

131
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:00,301
to cause them damage and to stop

132
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:05,263
the renew of their stocks,
the only way to destroy

133
00:11:05,951 --> 00:11:09,989
the order and obtain victory.
upon people so weel organized.

134
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,259
Your faithful and obedient
Giovanni De'Medici.

135
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:35,300
Here's the reward for a soldier
of these days.

136
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:39,705
a bullet flattened as a coin.

137
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,863
Colonel Cuppano,

138
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:47,461
the new fire weapons change the wars,

139
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:50,621
but the wars change the world.

140
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:52,764
For the honored
Captain De'Medici.

141
00:13:53,293 --> 00:13:56,330
Your Highness can be sure

142
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:58,967
that you're so important to me

143
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:02,404
that i'll always regret

144
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:06,441
when you make me a request
that I can't fulfill.

145
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:10,925
like this from today, regarding
the artillery

146
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:16,445
that you ask, and I can't do.

147
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,569
And certainly, I don't know anyone

148
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:24,241
that can do that on these dark times.

149
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,361
That is the reason

150
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:29,880
that i ask you, Captain De'Medici,

151
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:33,321
that you forgive me, because I can't
do what you're asking

152
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:42,437
Your brother,
Alfonso D'Este, Duke of Ferrara.

153
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,727
A long hair and a long beard are both
a nest for lices.

154
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,755
And is an advantage to the enemy.

155
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:27,439
I'm so hungry that I could eat a pig.
- And i'd eat even it's bones.

156
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:30,197
Those bastards, of all races and religions

157
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,235
just do evil things.
They rape women,

158
00:15:33,562 --> 00:15:35,792
burn the grass and kill the cattle.

159
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:39,434
they stole our things,
and what is worse

160
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:43,516
they don't have any respect for our
land and our people.

161
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:48,393
The Pope's army is poor, they don't
have any money.

162
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:50,360
Enough!

163
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,396
No money! Ruffians!

164
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,193
The faster we get rid of the Germans

165
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,511
the faster we the rid of the Pontificals,
that are worse than the Turkish.

166
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,473
Bastards! They hurt the ones they
have to defend.

167
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,676
as the one who they have to fight.

168
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,639
To end this war with the minimun cost,

169
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,792
We should allow General Frundsberg
to pass.

170
00:16:09,158 --> 00:16:11,388
through the passage of  Curtatone.

171
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:14,308
The German is in a hurry to cross the Pó

172
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,032
to get rid of the pontifical soldiers.

173
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:19,951
Fog today, clouds tomorrow.

174
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,234
If the lansquenetes can have

175
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:25,031
on day ahead of the pontifical.

176
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:27,996
they can cross the river and
open the way to Milan.

177
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:37,984
Guards!
- To your work!

178
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:43,145
Inform the vicar that Gonzaga said,

179
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,870
that tonight we'll let General Frundsberg pass.

180
00:16:47,154 --> 00:16:49,622
and so his Army.
- Yes, Your Honor.

181
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,746
In the name of the father, the son

182
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,544
And The Holy Spirit. Amen.

183
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:53,062
What they'll say in Mântua

184
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:55,978
when they see me

185
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:59,866
asking favors for other people?

186
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:05,381
You'll be put aside.

187
00:18:20,344 --> 00:18:22,221
Here you have,

188
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:24,614
the reward for my honor,

189
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,420
that, without hesitation,

190
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:30,298
I delivered for everyone to see.

191
00:18:31,703 --> 00:18:33,659
Everyone is watching

192
00:18:34,103 --> 00:18:36,412
the love that you've been showing.

193
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,650
They know that I trust you

194
00:18:41,342 --> 00:18:44,095
They know that I never denied

195
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,812
any favors.

196
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,819
It's too cruel

197
00:18:51,581 --> 00:18:55,130
that from this love,
that I though that it was eternal

198
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:59,689
I got only disgrace

199
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,451
All that I have left

200
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,414
is to bear the disgrace of my husband.

201
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,219
And I can only hope for

202
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:12,013
a disgraceful fate.

203
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:43,124
In the name of Your Majesty,
the Emperor,

204
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,565
The german Ambassador

205
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:48,323
for the Duke of Ferrara,
Alfonso D'Este!

206
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,840
Your Precious Imperial Highness,

207
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,770
Carlos V,Emperor Of Germany

208
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,120
Sent me in person,

209
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,524
a noble Ambassador

210
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:45,124
so that I can share.

211
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:48,203
of your honored investiment.

212
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:52,397
And also to bring the wedding contract.

213
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:55,883
Between our son, Hercule

214
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,883
and your beloved daughter

215
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:02,165
the distinct Margarida of Áustria.

216
00:21:05,927 --> 00:21:08,600
Artillery piece known as
"falconetto",

217
00:21:09,206 --> 00:21:11,766
a new mecanism of reloading from
the back, allowing

218
00:21:12,126 --> 00:21:15,084
a faster charging and a greater fire power.

219
00:21:39,163 --> 00:21:40,801
Hurry up!

220
00:21:45,923 --> 00:21:47,992
Hide this.

221
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:34,314
My beloved wife,

222
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:37,117
please, send me six plates,

223
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,627
some bowls and cups.

224
00:22:40,757 --> 00:22:42,986
Two towels and 8 napkins.

225
00:22:43,636 --> 00:22:45,433
Two blouses,

226
00:22:46,516 --> 00:22:49,713
Because is very cold in here.

227
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:02,223
Since our last report,

228
00:23:02,794 --> 00:23:05,467
nothing happened in here,

229
00:23:05,874 --> 00:23:07,990
that we should tell you, Your Highness.

230
00:23:09,674 --> 00:23:13,302
And if wasn't for these letters,

231
00:23:14,473 --> 00:23:16,941
it wouldn't bother you

232
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:20,060
in your absence.

233
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:53,788
Keep it straight.

234
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:56,979
For God's sake.

235
00:23:59,068 --> 00:24:00,820
Keep yourself on the border.

236
00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:03,788
With the chain!

237
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:14,019
That's it! Well done.

238
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,501
I'm Matteo Cusastro,

239
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:38,139
Chanceler of the Marquis of Mântua.

240
00:24:39,064 --> 00:24:43,376
I bring greetings from Your Highness,
and the promise of hospitality

241
00:24:43,864 --> 00:24:46,331
to General Frundsberg

242
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:50,373
and his Imperial Army in Gonzaga's Fort.

243
00:24:57,342 --> 00:24:59,810
Fill it, so it'll last the whole night.

244
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,497
Read something to me.

245
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,615
Here's what Maquiavel wrote:

246
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:26,537
"The loyalty of the mercenaries
is short.

247
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:31,407
"Why should them be loyal to the ones
they don't know?"

248
00:25:32,338 --> 00:25:36,013
"Why Gods and Saints would we make
them swear?

249
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:40,288
"The ones they love,
or the ones they hate?

250
00:25:41,697 --> 00:25:44,336
"I don't know anyone they love.

251
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,687
"But i know they hate everyone

252
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:52,246
"Nothing is worst than the idea

253
00:25:52,576 --> 00:25:56,455
"that all the wars are created
because of money.

254
00:25:57,576 --> 00:25:59,884
"Instead Of politics."
- Capitão De'Medici!

255
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:02,413
Who's there?

256
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:06,732
They located Frundsberg
in the road of Mântua.

257
00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:09,562
Between Montanara and Curtatone.

258
00:26:09,894 --> 00:26:12,647
preceded by a squadron, with
Gonzaga's weapons.

259
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:15,653
You're sure?
- According to our patrol.

260
00:26:16,014 --> 00:26:18,891
That bastard Federico
swears loyalty to the Pope,

261
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:21,443
And then offers protection
to the Germans.

262
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:24,571
It's politics, Monsieur Aretino
Like Maquiavel wrote,

263
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,647
the politics is worst than the weapons.

264
00:26:28,012 --> 00:26:29,570
The Germans had gone back

265
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:33,089
to cross the Pó.
We can't stop them now.

266
00:26:33,412 --> 00:26:35,562
If we stop Frundsberg,
we'll stop the war.

267
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:39,287
To proceed at night,
the great risk is the swamp.

268
00:26:40,211 --> 00:26:42,281
The worst thing for the soldiers

269
00:26:42,611 --> 00:26:44,841
The wars represent only
problems, dear Luc'Antonio.

270
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:47,480
The cavalry must be ready to leave.

271
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:01,954
Guards!

272
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:04,162
A moment!

273
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:06,915
Wait!
A car will leave.

274
00:28:16,481 --> 00:28:18,233
Let it pass!

275
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,433
Raise the door, but don't
block the chains

276
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,918
Two sentinels waiting for orders.

277
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:38,872
Where are you going at this time?

278
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,878
You're searching for hell

279
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:45,431
or there are crows in your rooftop?

280
00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:49,152
You're damned souls without rest?

281
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:52,350
De Profundis Clamo Te Domine.

282
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:54,792
We're searching the camp
of the pontificals.

283
00:28:55,717 --> 00:29:00,073
Search for your salvation,
your ignorants..

284
00:29:00,436 --> 00:29:03,269
We're living times of ignorance,

285
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:06,191
and the triumph of the Beast

286
00:29:06,476 --> 00:29:09,626
For your there is no forgiveness,
no salvation,

287
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,866
Is there anyone in here?

288
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,747
Answer!

289
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,300
We're searching Captain De'Medici.

290
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:30,138
They're gone for a few hours.

291
00:30:35,506 --> 00:30:37,064
Let's go.

292
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:39,698
We'll keep searching.

293
00:30:48,705 --> 00:30:50,660
Pontifical mail.

294
00:30:52,904 --> 00:30:54,974
Inform captain De'Medici!

295
00:30:55,304 --> 00:30:57,772
The Germans entered through
the passage of Curtatone!

296
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,541
Ride faster.

297
00:31:01,183 --> 00:31:03,060
And stick together.

298
00:31:09,982 --> 00:31:12,860
Vicar, release the guards.

299
00:31:14,022 --> 00:31:15,740
All torches must be thrown away.

300
00:31:21,461 --> 00:31:23,850
Hurry! They can't see the light.

301
00:31:24,061 --> 00:31:25,540
Silence.

302
00:32:12,976 --> 00:32:15,535
Raise the bridge and tie the chains.

303
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:26,126
Order everyone to be quiet tonight.

304
00:32:34,613 --> 00:32:37,525
You, where you're going?

305
00:32:38,493 --> 00:32:41,326
Stop! Customs from Parma.

306
00:32:46,092 --> 00:32:49,164
Who are you, venicean dog?

307
00:32:51,092 --> 00:32:53,002
I bring salt.

308
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:55,562
From Ferrara to Mântua.

309
00:32:57,451 --> 00:32:59,521
Always authorized.

310
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:02,404
Screw you

311
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:07,324
And your mother too.

312
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,158
ANd your father, that pig.

313
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:13,768
Hurry up!

314
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:19,325
Tonight, we did it.

315
00:34:55,558 --> 00:34:58,436
Commander Frundsberg
allowed me to know that he understands.

316
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:02,837
the damage caused by those soldiers on
this land.

317
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:05,587
But that's war, there's nothing you can do.

318
00:35:05,997 --> 00:35:09,114
And to you, he'll always be grateful.

319
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:12,791
For let him pass.

320
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:17,992
Giving him an advantage on the pontificals.

321
00:35:18,276 --> 00:35:21,985
and cross the Pó in Ostiglia,
the only bridge still in one piece.

322
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:25,429
But, to leave no doubts.

323
00:35:25,835 --> 00:35:28,429
We'll send an urgent message to
His Holiness.

324
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:33,305
To tell how Your Highness

325
00:35:33,594 --> 00:35:35,824
Ask him for forgiveness.

326
00:35:36,194 --> 00:35:39,152
For what i was forced to do,

327
00:35:39,714 --> 00:35:43,991
Because i could never had stopped the
lansquenetes from passing

328
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,947
they would pass anyway.

329
00:35:48,673 --> 00:35:50,708
Guards, open.

330
00:35:51,992 --> 00:35:54,222
Lower the bridge.

331
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,744
I'm Giovanni De'Medici,

332
00:35:59,232 --> 00:36:02,143
Captain of the pontifical army,
asking for passage.

333
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:06,421
We're searcing the germans from Frundsberg! Open it.

334
00:36:07,191 --> 00:36:09,829
Tell the vicar to give the order.

335
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,027
In the name of God, don't answer.

336
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,262
In the name of His Holiness,
and Your King.

337
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:20,298
That the eternal Lord kill us right now.

338
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:24,224
Open this door.

339
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,065
Betray the church.

340
00:36:27,629 --> 00:36:30,745
Or tomorrow i'll cut your throats,
starting from the vicar.

341
00:36:31,788 --> 00:36:34,586
And this bastard Gonzaga

342
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:37,546
Traitors! Bastards

343
00:36:37,747 --> 00:36:39,897
Bastards!

344
00:36:51,146 --> 00:36:53,102
What is that at this time of the night?

345
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:55,303
It's captain De'Medici.

346
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:58,099
He's in the passage of Curtatone
with his men.

347
00:36:58,705 --> 00:37:00,935
He's searching for General Frundsberg,
in the middle of the night.

348
00:37:04,385 --> 00:37:07,660
He manaced the vicar and Your Highness.

349
00:37:10,064 --> 00:37:12,578
He said that if we don't lower the bridge.

350
00:37:12,984 --> 00:37:15,258
Tomorrow morning, heads will roll.

351
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:31,773
firewood for the fire.

352
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:34,456
We need to get warm.

353
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:43,178
Look!

354
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,250
What a strange Christ.

355
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,730
The Christ of the poors.

356
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,897
of the hungry,
the homeless.

357
00:38:23,056 --> 00:38:26,446
Bivaque Bande Nere near the walls of Curtatone

358
00:38:45,494 --> 00:38:47,644
If the money dows not came from Rome.

359
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,688
What we'll say?

360
00:38:52,893 --> 00:38:55,327
TO be happy with the blessing
of the Pope?

361
00:39:02,452 --> 00:39:04,841
Wine against the cold??

362
00:39:06,372 --> 00:39:08,168
Dear Luc'Antonio,

363
00:39:08,451 --> 00:39:10,487
in Rome, you know

364
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:14,007
that the blessing without weapons
doesn't win wars.

365
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:50,564
Get him up.

366
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:52,883
Pull the head.

367
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:55,403
See if he bites you.

368
00:39:56,806 --> 00:39:59,684
Or send you to hell to burn your ass.

369
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:02,597
To warm myself

370
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:04,921
i'd burn the Christ and the Virgin Mary.

371
00:42:16,511 --> 00:42:18,502
My beloved wife,

372
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:20,986
i want you to go to Rome,

373
00:42:21,551 --> 00:42:23,667
the faster the better.

374
00:42:24,191 --> 00:42:26,306
You know my needs.

375
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,501
Explain that to the Pope.

376
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,339
How i'm without means to continue.

377
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:35,105
In the war, tho ear the
respect of the soldiers.

378
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:38,747
we have to spend as much as we can.

379
00:42:47,108 --> 00:42:49,417
I ordered a little bed,

380
00:42:50,588 --> 00:42:53,499
so that 2 men can carry without problem.

381
00:42:54,467 --> 00:42:58,745
Our little Cosimo had a fever
during two days.

382
00:42:59,187 --> 00:43:01,939
but we had no doubts that he would be
better soon.

383
00:43:02,466 --> 00:43:04,741
so we left Rome.,

384
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:08,183
although is snowing.

385
00:43:10,946 --> 00:43:15,063
Sunday, 24 of November.

386
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:26,180
Where is the vicar?

387
00:43:28,584 --> 00:43:31,097
You, go and tell Federico

388
00:43:31,463 --> 00:43:33,693
Who's always doing bad things

389
00:43:34,023 --> 00:43:36,457
That when I find the Germans,
I'll be back

390
00:43:36,903 --> 00:43:38,939
So I can have a good talk with him

391
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:41,976
who didn't let me in yesterday

392
00:43:42,782 --> 00:43:45,376
I'll punch him until he pukes shit.

393
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,571
It's our fault.

394
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,368
that the vicar didn't open the door

395
00:44:07,699 --> 00:44:10,213
to no one, at that time?

396
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:16,619
If he had talked to us,

397
00:44:17,218 --> 00:44:19,493
like everyone should do

398
00:44:19,938 --> 00:44:22,577
we would ask him to open.

399
00:44:22,898 --> 00:44:25,128
the passage of Curtatone.

400
00:44:25,658 --> 00:44:28,091
But Your Highness

401
00:44:28,497 --> 00:44:31,648
Knows SignorJoanni better than anyone.

402
00:44:32,057 --> 00:44:34,730
He was always very violent.

403
00:44:35,337 --> 00:44:38,851
When he was young, killed a friend
with his sword

404
00:44:40,056 --> 00:44:42,411
Holy Mother,
what a fog.

405
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:29,463
In the border of Pó, near Mântua,
in a discrete place.

406
00:49:29,985 --> 00:49:32,499
General Frundsberg received

407
00:49:32,985 --> 00:49:35,135
the four pieces of artillery

408
00:49:35,745 --> 00:49:39,532
given in secret by Alfonso
D'Este. Now, the german.

409
00:49:39,904 --> 00:49:42,782
knowing that will surprise the pontifical army
with the cannon

410
00:49:43,424 --> 00:49:46,221
decided to cross the Pó
in Ostiglia

411
00:49:47,223 --> 00:49:49,737
to get rid of Captain De'Medici,

412
00:49:50,543 --> 00:49:53,615
whose cavalry were coming to get him.

413
00:49:54,023 --> 00:49:58,015
Gaining time, riding through the bay of
Bagnolo San Vito,

414
00:49:59,462 --> 00:50:02,534
Where he's getting in prior of
the german army.

415
00:50:03,382 --> 00:50:05,815
who's been advancing for hours.

416
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:10,811
When our country get rid of these armies.

417
00:50:12,181 --> 00:50:14,933
well be free of this war.

418
00:51:21,053 --> 00:51:23,203
It looks like the head of the column.

419
00:51:24,533 --> 00:51:26,364
It's the personal guard of Frundsberg.

420
00:51:36,172 --> 00:51:40,005
But he's not there.

421
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:53,127
Armors in the center.

422
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:57,044
Take positions on the hill.

423
00:52:02,769 --> 00:52:04,441
Take the right distance to fire.

424
00:52:26,206 --> 00:52:28,037
Load!

425
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,439
Don't resist!

426
00:53:09,802 --> 00:53:11,996
Don't resist!

427
00:53:17,121 --> 00:53:19,589
Keep yourselves in the border

428
00:53:19,681 --> 00:53:22,240
they're retreating!
Don't fight.

429
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,915
BASTARDS.

430
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,595
FIght as soldiers.

431
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,235
What kind of men are you?

432
00:53:30,799 --> 00:53:33,029
Bastards sons of bitches.

433
00:55:15,148 --> 00:55:18,026
Although last friday and saturday

434
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:21,904
we've had an horrible journey,
through cold and snow.

435
00:55:22,388 --> 00:55:25,345
We arrived on Rome last night.
In our father's house.

436
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,063
safe and sound, thank God.

437
00:55:28,387 --> 00:55:31,185
We've been imediately received by our
uncle, the Pope.

438
00:55:31,507 --> 00:55:34,543
With affection and attention.

439
00:55:34,826 --> 00:55:38,102
I spoke to him about our necessities
on the war.

440
00:55:38,986 --> 00:55:41,181
His answer was

441
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:44,662
that he would give us support,
day or night.

442
00:55:45,065 --> 00:55:47,340
every time we needed.

443
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:12,216
We should prepare to go back
before the night falls?

444
00:56:22,901 --> 00:56:24,698
Before night fall

445
00:56:26,581 --> 00:56:28,492
There's one more thing.

446
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:31,254
To expel Frundsberg!

447
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,212
By horse, two by two.

448
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,653
Rapid cavalry
two by two.

449
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:33,806
Why are you so proud?

450
00:57:34,693 --> 00:57:38,129
Where are you going,
armed as killers?

451
00:57:39,653 --> 00:57:41,848
You don't need our weapons

452
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:44,760
TO exterminate the people in this world.

453
00:57:45,172 --> 00:57:48,323
Listen to me! Be careful

454
00:57:49,092 --> 00:57:52,607
The Lord's vengeance is too powerful

455
00:57:52,732 --> 00:57:55,040
More than all of your swords.

456
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:56,763
Shut up, priest.

457
00:57:56,971 --> 00:58:00,043
The real wealth is not from this world.

458
00:58:02,331 --> 00:58:05,367
Stabulum hoc praeponere coelo!

459
01:01:35,428 --> 01:01:37,578
That's him.

460
01:03:06,738 --> 01:03:08,854
It's an ambush.

461
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:11,648
Retreat.

462
01:03:12,697 --> 01:03:14,892
Artillery.

463
01:03:44,734 --> 01:03:47,612
General Della Rovere
inform your HIGHNESS.

464
01:03:47,974 --> 01:03:50,362
that they did not took him to the
dormitory yet,

465
01:03:51,493 --> 01:03:53,165
What we now for sure

466
01:03:53,493 --> 01:03:56,007
is hat he got hurt in a skirmish with the lansquenetes,

467
01:03:56,573 --> 01:03:59,211
that were hidden nearby

468
01:03:59,532 --> 01:04:01,682
in San Nicolo da Po.

469
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:05,850
Joanni went there with his cavalry.

470
01:04:06,732 --> 01:04:10,565
In the ambush, he got hurt in
the leg by a bullet.

471
01:04:12,171 --> 01:04:15,607
The General Della Rovere is worried

472
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:19,440
because he doesn't know from where Frundsberg
artillery is coming from.

473
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,488
We already informed

474
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:24,484
His Holiness, the Pope

475
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:28,524
That Marquis Federico
does not have this artillery.

476
01:04:29,169 --> 01:04:31,000
And the few we have

477
01:04:31,569 --> 01:04:33,924
we want to save it, as our only defense.

478
01:04:34,529 --> 01:04:36,678
and nothing more.

479
01:04:37,968 --> 01:04:40,528
So, we don't take any advantage

480
01:04:40,888 --> 01:04:44,005
and no one shows so powerful weapons
paid by the church

481
01:04:44,568 --> 01:04:46,842
the Pope, actually

482
01:04:47,487 --> 01:04:49,796
The German artillery

483
01:04:50,287 --> 01:04:52,278
for what we know

484
01:04:52,647 --> 01:04:54,877
Belongs to the Duke of Ferrara

485
01:04:55,206 --> 01:04:59,358
who delivered to Frundsberg
during the night.

486
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:03,002
in boats used to transport salt

487
01:05:06,045 --> 01:05:09,242
And neither the Duke officials,
nor ours.

488
01:05:09,565 --> 01:05:11,635
have looked closely on these boats

489
01:05:13,005 --> 01:05:14,517
Look!

490
01:05:14,804 --> 01:05:16,840
It's snowing.

491
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:19,513
Holy Mother!

492
01:05:31,843 --> 01:05:34,595
The renowned Signor De'Medicis,

493
01:05:35,082 --> 01:05:37,915
Commander of the Pontifical Army,

494
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:48,191
The last shot of "Falconete"

495
01:05:48,881 --> 01:05:51,599
Bad Luck!
- The Real bad luck

496
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,037
is that the winter is really wild

497
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:58,033
and the cold causes more damage than
the weapons

498
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,074
And our own MesserJoannino
is the first between those fanatics.

499
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:05,359
Even polished the metal of his armor

500
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:08,876
to fight during the night.
What could be worse?

501
01:06:11,198 --> 01:06:13,393
Famous General,

502
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:16,875
Our error was to attack the germans,
who have a god commander

503
01:06:17,478 --> 01:06:20,708
they already have an advantage on position.

504
01:06:21,037 --> 01:06:23,346
But if they refuse to admit
their error.

505
01:06:24,477 --> 01:06:28,026
They cant blame us for the incident
with the passage in Curtatone.

506
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:30,905
It remained closed, as usual,

507
01:06:31,276 --> 01:06:33,744
since the world is world.

508
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,706
Messer Gonzaga,

509
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:31,629
Captain De'Medici searched for

510
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:34,424
your protection, and no one else

511
01:07:35,749 --> 01:07:38,104
May God reward you a thousand times.

512
01:07:38,509 --> 01:07:40,898
for helping us.

513
01:07:41,229 --> 01:07:43,504
It is a great reward to

514
01:07:44,228 --> 01:07:46,901
help Captain De'Medici.

515
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,818
With a wound in the same leg

516
01:08:00,307 --> 01:08:02,582
he wounded in Pavia's battle.

517
01:08:03,066 --> 01:08:05,534
It was a great honor to me

518
01:08:06,066 --> 01:08:09,138
to be in the battlefield by your side

519
01:08:18,665 --> 01:08:21,384
Your cousin, Marquis Federico,
is coming to visit you

520
01:08:21,744 --> 01:08:24,338
with the General Della
Rovere, Duke de Urbino.

521
01:08:25,464 --> 01:08:27,614
General!
- My respects.

522
01:08:28,384 --> 01:08:30,136
Dear cousin,

523
01:08:30,424 --> 01:08:32,857
We all regret

524
01:08:33,143 --> 01:08:35,737
the bad luck of our
Joannino.

525
01:08:36,063 --> 01:08:38,816
Without Captain De'Medici in the battlefields

526
01:08:39,663 --> 01:08:42,335
His Holiness, the Pope,
will have all the reasons

527
01:08:42,622 --> 01:08:45,455
to be worried with the result
of this war.

528
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:07,296
That's strange, a general like yourself

529
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:10,778
abandon the battle to visit a sick one.

530
01:09:11,859 --> 01:09:15,693
However, I should be happy with my luck

531
01:09:16,739 --> 01:09:19,969
Because, even with all the bad things
that already happened

532
01:09:21,338 --> 01:09:24,296
I had the honor to be brought
to the house of MesserLoyso,

533
01:09:24,658 --> 01:09:26,614
who is like

534
01:09:26,898 --> 01:09:29,570
a brother to me,

535
01:09:32,257 --> 01:09:34,612
and, if I die here,

536
01:09:36,257 --> 01:09:39,293
I wouldn't be seen

537
01:09:40,736 --> 01:09:44,172
as an enemy of Gonzaga Family.

538
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:51,324
Our renowned
Marquês Federico

539
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:54,215
had rapidly called

540
01:09:54,615 --> 01:09:56,730
the surgeon, Habram,

541
01:09:57,094 --> 01:09:59,608
that will take care of you with
all of his knowledge.

542
01:10:03,254 --> 01:10:06,086
For all of this, i'm really grateful
to  Messer Federico

543
01:10:06,933 --> 01:10:10,846
for our old friendship and his charity.

544
01:10:13,773 --> 01:10:15,888
And I thank you all,

545
01:10:16,492 --> 01:10:18,767
My dear friends.

546
01:10:20,572 --> 01:10:22,722
But, above all, I thank God

547
01:10:23,971 --> 01:10:27,725
who allows us to do everything.

548
01:10:28,011 --> 01:10:29,922
Master Habram is here.

549
01:10:30,411 --> 01:10:32,641
Great, let him do his job.

550
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:35,267
Monday, 25 of November

551
01:13:54,309 --> 01:13:56,186
It doesn't worth it

552
01:13:56,509 --> 01:13:59,023
The leeches are not working,

553
01:13:59,628 --> 01:14:01,823
we've tried twice

554
01:14:03,228 --> 01:14:05,788
That's a signal that the blood is deteriorated.

555
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:09,262
The wound is full of worms

556
01:14:09,747 --> 01:14:12,819
It's been 20 hours since he was treated.

557
01:14:13,947 --> 01:14:16,415
The doctor said he is in
danger of death

558
01:14:18,826 --> 01:14:21,818
Although nothing is for sure.

559
01:14:22,186 --> 01:14:24,780
before the end of the fourth day.

560
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:58,458
Your impetuous nature

561
01:14:59,422 --> 01:15:02,619
always stopped you from

562
01:15:03,222 --> 01:15:05,416
make use of my wealth

563
01:15:06,141 --> 01:15:08,371
As I wanted you to do.

564
01:15:09,701 --> 01:15:12,420
Ask me anything now

565
01:15:13,421 --> 01:15:18,494
Worthy of us both.

566
01:15:25,099 --> 01:15:29,809
Love me, when i'm dead

567
01:19:03,756 --> 01:19:06,395
so that my wound

568
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:11,504
don't contaminate my whole body

569
01:19:14,675 --> 01:19:16,950
There's no other way

570
01:19:18,914 --> 01:19:21,189
we have to cut the leg off.

571
01:19:28,313 --> 01:19:30,907
Do what you have to do

572
01:19:34,313 --> 01:19:37,622
We need clothes to make sheets

573
01:19:39,152 --> 01:19:41,586
In my house there's no one

574
01:19:42,192 --> 01:19:44,660
Promise me that you'll send some

575
01:19:45,032 --> 01:19:47,340
But I don't know what i'm gonna do.

576
01:19:53,551 --> 01:19:56,860
Send two towels,

577
01:19:57,590 --> 01:20:00,423
and two crosses.

578
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:04,941
And also

579
01:20:05,389 --> 01:20:07,300
two packs of roses

580
01:20:08,869 --> 01:20:11,064
to put on his bed

581
01:20:12,309 --> 01:20:14,379
and give him a good fragrance.

582
01:20:16,548 --> 01:20:20,018
Wednesday, 27 of November

583
01:22:40,693 --> 01:22:42,604
Everyone, get out.

584
01:22:49,612 --> 01:22:51,409
Cut it!

585
01:22:52,972 --> 01:22:54,962
With the help of God Almighty

586
01:25:11,237 --> 01:25:15,309
I'm sad because I couldn't send
everything you asked.

587
01:25:17,316 --> 01:25:20,433
As i wrote, one day I'll have
more money

588
01:25:21,396 --> 01:25:23,705
and then, i'll serve you better.

589
01:26:35,188 --> 01:26:37,418
Am I healed?

590
01:26:57,985 --> 01:27:01,455
Friday, 29 of November

591
01:28:54,453 --> 01:28:57,251
Inform Maria not to believe

592
01:28:58,213 --> 01:29:02,046
so fast in a disgrace.

593
01:29:04,612 --> 01:29:06,762
and that, in the next moon,

594
01:29:10,931 --> 01:29:13,240
i'll be back home

595
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:29,484
This is only to inform you

596
01:29:30,489 --> 01:29:32,480
that, right now

597
01:29:33,529 --> 01:29:36,282
i'm about to give birth

598
01:29:39,568 --> 01:29:42,844
And i'm sure that the child is
from Your HIghness.

599
01:29:45,648 --> 01:29:48,241
Although I don't ask for money right now,

600
01:29:49,047 --> 01:29:51,686
I ask you a favor.

601
01:29:54,727 --> 01:29:57,365
please, write to my husband

602
01:30:00,766 --> 01:30:03,758
that, in respect for Your Highness

603
01:30:05,206 --> 01:30:08,277
he doesn't leave me alone, as he did in the past

604
01:30:13,165 --> 01:30:16,361
only in the interest of the unborn child

605
01:30:20,204 --> 01:30:22,513
because she'll have his blood.

606
01:30:47,001 --> 01:30:49,196
Please,

607
01:30:49,481 --> 01:30:52,314
Read something for me

608
01:31:38,156 --> 01:31:42,592
During my whole life,

609
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:47,070
I've always lived

610
01:31:48,794 --> 01:31:50,989
as a soldier

611
01:31:52,594 --> 01:31:55,347
as I would've lived

612
01:31:55,874 --> 01:31:58,751
by the rules of the religious

613
01:32:00,433 --> 01:32:03,345
If I had chosen that path

614
01:32:05,593 --> 01:32:08,060
that you did.

615
01:32:10,552 --> 01:32:13,350
From the abyss, I call for you, my Lord.

616
01:32:13,752 --> 01:32:16,061
Hear my voice.

617
01:32:16,592 --> 01:32:18,741
Hear my prayers

618
01:32:19,991 --> 01:32:23,267
If you remember all of
our sins

619
01:32:24,551 --> 01:32:26,620
How can we be saved.

620
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:30,426
Have mercy of me, Lord.

621
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:33,584
Freed me of my unhappiness

622
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:36,588
And, with all of your Love

623
01:32:37,269 --> 01:32:39,624
erase all of my sins.

624
01:32:40,589 --> 01:32:43,228
Óh, death, where's your victory?

625
01:32:43,829 --> 01:32:46,581
Where is the blade of your sword?

626
01:32:47,588 --> 01:32:49,943
The inevitable weapon of death

627
01:32:50,308 --> 01:32:52,868
Is in the law of sin.

628
01:32:54,228 --> 01:32:56,821
But I hope that you save me, my Lord

629
01:32:58,187 --> 01:33:00,860
and my soul believes in your
forgiveness.

630
01:33:02,147 --> 01:33:04,421
and my soul is waiting for You.

631
01:33:04,906 --> 01:33:07,659
more than the sentinels wait for the dawn.

632
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:11,896
The Famous Signor
Joanni De'Medici,

633
01:34:12,579 --> 01:34:17,448
Captain of the army of
His Holiness Clemente VII,

634
01:34:18,539 --> 01:34:22,087
remained ill for four days

635
01:34:22,498 --> 01:34:25,296
and then, died of a fever

636
01:34:25,938 --> 01:34:30,374
after he got shot by a cannon

637
01:34:32,057 --> 01:34:34,287
in Mântua,

638
01:34:34,577 --> 01:34:38,285
In the last day of November
of 1526

639
01:35:11,653 --> 01:35:15,406
The German kept walking
along the river

640
01:35:15,932 --> 01:35:18,730
In Ostiglia, they crossed the Pó.

641
01:35:19,332 --> 01:35:22,051
Free of Captain De'Medici,

642
01:35:22,812 --> 01:35:26,008
nothing else could stop them.

643
01:35:27,451 --> 01:35:29,282
The General Frundsberg,

644
01:35:29,731 --> 01:35:31,608
badly ill,

645
01:35:32,011 --> 01:35:34,888
Had to abandon his army, and go home

646
01:35:36,610 --> 01:35:39,078
The army of your majesty

647
01:35:39,610 --> 01:35:41,566
The Emperor Carlos V,

648
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:44,119
joined with the army of Bourbon,

649
01:35:44,409 --> 01:35:47,446
and then conquered the city of Rome

650
01:35:47,849 --> 01:35:50,727
In May of 1527.

651
01:35:52,289 --> 01:35:56,281
Because of the dead of
Captain Joanni De'Medici,

652
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:59,920
The most famous commanders and
captains of all armies

653
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:02,519
expressed their wish

654
01:36:03,087 --> 01:36:05,760
that the fire weapons would never be used

655
01:36:06,607 --> 01:36:08,325
against the men
