1
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,813
Rosanna!

2
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,090
I'm talking to you Rosanna
and I know you can hear me.

3
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,770
Please see to it that Karl doesn't
spend entire Summer at the computer.

4
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,859
And you too... don't read so much,
try to get outside also.

5
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,412
It's really beautiful over there.
You can ride the bikes anywhere.

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,218
You don't want to talk to me?
- No.

7
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,809
Rosanna, mom will need peace
after the surgery.

8
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,409
You're a big girl already,
you should understand.

9
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,537
What if I'll never see her again.

10
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,935
Don't be foolish.

11
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,408
The surgery could fail.

12
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,410
Don't you ever say that.

13
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,336
It can't fail.

14
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,089
Friar Johannes and Brother Martinus
got real close to making gold.

15
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,613
Did you kill them?

16
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,572
Recipe?!

17
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,857
Nobody must know about this.

18
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,179
Nobody shall ever know.

19
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,613
KID DETECTIVES AND
THE SCRET OF THE WHITE LADY

20
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,176
Markus! Are you deaf?

21
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,735
Markus!

22
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,218
I'm gonna be late for work,
you'll have to watch Emilia.

23
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,654
I'm already big.

24
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,612
Let me be the judge of that, okay.

25
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,731
You'll be home by 12.

26
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,291
I have to sell the books
of Mr. Krookus.

27
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,810
We're going to have guests,
have you already forgotten?

28
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,812
Mom, why do we have to have strangers
here for the whole Summer?

29
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,931
Loviis was my best friend at school.

30
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,176
She asked for my help,
I couldn't turn her down.

31
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,859
They will not ruin your summer.

32
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,652
Rosanna and Karl
are almost your age.

33
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,418
You'll have fun together.

34
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,053
Hey, help me close this.

35
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,211
Sometimes I wonder how many kids
do I really have.

36
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,048
Well, go on.

37
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,457
And don't forget.
We've got tickets for tonight.

38
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,456
Yeah-yeah.

39
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,378
Did you do everything correctly,
Henricus?

40
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,730
Yes, to create the homunculus,

41
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,815
I took one portion of bones,

42
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,969
after that

43
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,692
a little bit of semen

44
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,098
a bit skin and hair.

45
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,893
From every animal homunculus
has to look like.

46
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,614
Then I placed it all
in one container.

47
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,658
Covered everything
with horse manure

48
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,458
and left it for 40 days and 40 nights

49
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,697
untouched.

50
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,057
Now 40 days have passed
and the fetus of the homunculus

51
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,376
should be ready. Let's see it.
- Yes.

52
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,534
Instead of a little person
all I see

53
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,492
is horse manure.

54
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,339
Master, I did everything correctly.

55
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,770
It's already seventh attempt
that you have failed.

56
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,215
Throw this crap over the wall.

57
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,933
What are you staring at!

58
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,372
Haven't you seen crap before?

59
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,335
Go to work!

60
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,858
Buy a thriller "White Lady's
True Legend".

61
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,576
Written by our town's honorary
citizen Feliks Truu.

62
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,175
The bloodcurling tale
of the White Lady.

63
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,413
Witches, executioners
and burning of the witches.

64
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,732
Torture on the wheel.

65
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,449
This is stupid, nobody's
gonna buy it anyway.

66
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,459
Let's try for another 10 minutes.

67
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,849
Okay.

68
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,253
Only 7 euros and 9...
- Sorry.

69
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,216
What are you selling here?
- A book.

70
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,533
Feliks Truu's "True Story
of the White Lady".

71
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,810
So the White Lady was actually
an alchemist.

72
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,658
Very interesting theory.

73
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,618
Let's make a deal. If you promise
me, that it's a good read,

74
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,048
then I'll buy it.

75
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,256
I promise
- Promise?
- Yes.

76
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,334
Keep the change.

77
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,532
Go buy an icecream or something.

78
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,935
And who might you be?

79
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,409
I'm Emilia.

80
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,579
Can you tell me where is
the bishop's castle's museum?

81
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,050
Yes, it's right there,
around the corner.

82
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,768
By the way, my mom works there.

83
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,339
Excellent!

84
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,811
Maybe I'll meet your mom today.

85
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,536
During the entire morning
we've had only three guests.

86
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,617
If it continues like this,
we'll have to start firing people.

87
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,818
But White Lady's days are coming.

88
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,818
Then there's always more people.
- That's only temporary.

89
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,491
We need advertising.

90
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,299
More advertising...
- Sorry!

91
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,016
I couldn't help overhearing
your discussion.

92
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,690
When it comes to advertising,
I might be able to help you.

93
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,214
Who might you be?

94
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,815
Excuse me!

95
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,818
I am a photographer, Stig,
Stig Velson.

96
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,496
I am making a photo book of Haapsalu,
of the Bishop's Castle,

97
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,815
to be more exact.

98
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,736
Excuse us.

99
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,379
Berit, starting today,

100
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,454
you will be at this gentleman's
disposal 24/7.

101
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,856
This is exactly the advertising that we need.

102
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,855
Help!

103
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,173
Help!

104
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,570
Hello.
- Hello.

105
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,531
Hello, Markus. Hello, Emilia.

106
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,457
How did you do today?

107
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,619
Mr. Krookus, in three days we have
sold only two books.

108
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,497
One was bought by me and the other
one by a gentleman.

109
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,370
So sad that people don't care
about the true history of their town.

110
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,368
Split the money between you two.

111
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,849
Thanks.
- You've worked so hard.

112
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,655
Are you sure that everything happened
like it's written in this book?

113
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,211
Feliks Truu, this book's author

114
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,935
was internationally renowned
archaeologist.

115
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,251
He devoted his entire life
to exploring our Bishop's castle.

116
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,015
He stumbled upon the manuscript
of Bonifacius

117
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,175
and the White Lady's true story
is based on that.

118
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,888
And where is this manuscript now?

119
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,090
Unfortunately Feliks Truu died
so suddenly

120
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,298
that he couldn't tell anyone.

121
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,095
You have to be the last as always.

122
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,739
Hurry, Emilia, we had to be home
2 minutes ago.

123
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,214
Good bye.
- Good bye.

124
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,533
Rosanna, try to look more cheerful,
this is embarassing.

125
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,769
Remember, we'll be doing nothing
with these kids.

126
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,015
But why?

127
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,769
Our behaviour has to be so sucky
that they'll have to send us home.

128
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,936
Is this clear?
- Yes.

129
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,416
Come on in, don't be shy.

130
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,093
You'll be living here.

131
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,338
I'll take this bed.
- Take it if you want.

132
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,369
Thank you, you've really
put in an effort here.

133
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,538
Summer room, it needed to be
fixed up for some time already.

134
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,018
Kids were helping fully when they heard
they'll get playmates for summer.

135
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,853
I'll be going then, that way
I'll get back in time to visit Loviis.

136
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,491
Be good and listen to Berit.
- See you.

137
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,056
Don't worry, Rosanna takes a little
warming up but I can handle her.

138
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,779
Rosanna, do you want to
play badmington?

139
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,857
I don't want to play
any stupid ballgames.

140
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,288
Leave me alone!

141
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,490
Brother Franciscus is already
a third alchemist

142
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,414
that has died this month.

143
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,288
I think he stumbled
and fell off the wall.

144
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,817
But brother Martinus
who fell down the well?

145
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,939
And brother Johannes

146
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,731
who died unfortunately
after the supper?

147
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,810
Lord works in mysterious ways,
beyond reason for men.

148
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,810
They all worked on
manufacturing gold.

149
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,171
I'm afraid somebody wants to
hamper our efforts.

150
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,415
But who, Your Holiness?

151
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,329
I don't know yet but I swear,
I'll find out.

152
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,899
Hire yourself more
promising apprentices.

153
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,416
Gold has to be ready
by the end of this year.

154
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,294
And do not forget Homunculus.

155
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,529
Take it away.

156
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,492
I've lost my appetite.

157
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,179
Freeze! Hands on your head!
Face the wall!

158
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,894
What are you doing here?

159
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,297
I wanted to turn off the alarm
but something went wrong.

160
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,776
I opened a dance studio here.
- You may lower your hands.

161
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,250
May I see your documents?

162
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,096
Here you go.

163
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,379
Please, come on in!

164
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,016
I have to thank you somehow
for saving me from trouble.

165
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,529
Maybe a cup of coffee?

166
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,970
No, I have to go. Work matters.

167
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,490
Maybe you would be interested
in dance lessons?

168
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,298
For you I would give these for free.

169
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,253
Look, dancing and me,
these don't match.

170
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,496
Don't be so modest.

171
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,694
Take this at least.

172
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,970
Thank you!

173
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,699
See you later, Tonis Piir.

174
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,414
See you later, Karin Viisle.

175
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,217
Don't you ever regret it?

176
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,054
Regret what?

177
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,379
Marrying a man who can't dance,

178
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,372
sent to work to in the province?

179
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,852
Oh, come on!

180
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,015
Good boys!

181
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,010
Everyone within five seconds.

182
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,338
And you, you lazy bum,

183
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,732
what are you stalling?

184
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,578
One more.

185
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,729
I'm coming, coming.

186
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,537
Hello.
- Hello...

187
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,331
Yes. Piir here.

188
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,092
To Krookus' house?

189
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,334
Okay, I'll stop by the station.
Be right there.

190
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,973
What happened? 
- Break in at Krookus'store.

191
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,894
I'll take you home.

192
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,814
No. I want to listen
to the music.

193
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,937
Would you care to dance?

194
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,093
I'd love to.

195
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,936
My dearest possessions, gone.
- Please remove your hand.

196
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,412
The robbers had to know
precisely what to take?

197
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,816
They didn't know anything.

198
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,730
There are clocks many times
more valuable

199
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,255
You said it yourself,
your dearest clocks.

200
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,576
I didn't mean it like this.
The thing is

201
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,699
Those clocks belonged
to our town's honorary citizen

202
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,856
Mister...

203
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,368
Don't touch! 
- Sorry!

204
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,899
...Feliks Truu.

205
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,934
After his death I bought those
clocks from his daughter.

206
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,417
These have very high... 
- Please.

207
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,210
...cultural value. 
- I see.

208
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,299
One was up there.

209
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,258
And another one was here

210
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,774
Please, come and sit here.

211
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,050
Here were two really valuable clocks.

212
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,491
Here and here. 
- Please, just sit.

213
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,530
Yes, thank you.

214
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,810
Let me take the photos, do my job.

215
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,179
Down here.

216
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,251
God, what a great misfortune!

217
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,651
Oh, hi. 
- Hello-hello.

218
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,860
May I introduce my husband Tonis.

219
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,411
Stig Velson, photographer,
I told you about him.

220
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,735
Hello.

221
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,176
Hello.

222
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,093
It was lovely, Berit, but
unfortunately I have to go now.

223
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,178
Good evening. 
- Good evening.

224
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,936
That photographer seemed
like a pretty skilled dancer.

225
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,539
You noticed?

226
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,897
It was impossible not to.

227
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,169
Shall we go?

228
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,730
Kids, meal is ready!

229
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,609
Where are you going?

230
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,736
To eat.

231
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,850
You're not going anywhere.

232
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,018
We'll declare a hunger strike
until they send us home.

233
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,019
You can starve if you want
but I'm hungry.

234
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,018
Then you're a traitor. Nerd.

235
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,778
I'm not a traitor and I'm no nerd.
- Are too.

236
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,772
And a suck-up. 
- Do you know...

237
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,896
We should be with mom right now.
Get it?

238
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,058
I think we should do
as mom and dad told us.

239
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,653
Good morning. 
- Hi.

240
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,249
Where's Rosanna?

241
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,179
She didn't want to eat.

242
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,250
Rosanna!

243
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,892
I'm not going to pretend like
nothing bad hasn't happened.

244
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,739
Your mom is sick, about to have
a difficult surgery.

245
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,216
I'm sure there will come a time
when you have to support her.

246
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,695
Therefore there's no point
to starve yourself to death.

247
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,172
I'll never see mom again.

248
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,535
Mom promised you that
you'll meet again.

249
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,731
Promised, promised.

250
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,170
Only to get us away from there.

251
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,372
As much as I know Loviis,

252
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,890
She never breaks her promises
and we studied together for 12 years.

253
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,930
Rosanna.

254
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,177
Your mom would never lie to you
in such important matters.

255
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,053
Come, eat something.

256
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,651
Later you can go cycling.

257
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,330
Markus knows all sorts of cool places,
ruins and secret passageways.

258
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,529
Come!

259
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,252
And you shall see green flame

260
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,053
that comes from phosphorus.

261
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,368
What evil spirit has sent you
to this place?

262
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,775
I came because you called,
my name is Johan.

263
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,778
I heard you're looking
for an apprentice.

264
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,529
I could use a good apprentice,
but not one so eager

265
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,930
who would blow up my workshop.

266
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,173
What are you giggling about?

267
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,254
You finish the homunculus.

268
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,092
Where are you from?
- From the village.

269
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,972
I live with my mom.

270
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,338
My father was a doctor and an alchemist.
I learned these arts from him.

271
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,375
All right.

272
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,338
You can stay, for now.

273
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,054
Careful, I just got my hair done.

274
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,939
Tomorrow there's a jazz night at the
club. I rescheduled my shift.

275
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,653
I bought us two tickets.

276
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,579
Tonis, that is so sweet.

277
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,211
But tomorrow I can't.

278
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,815
What are you doing tomorrow?

279
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,488
I'm going to Noarootsi, to photograph
the sunset with Stig.

280
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,895
We have agreed with local fishermen.

281
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,539
Some other time. 
- Don't be upset! That was really sweet.

282
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,215
Let's go!

283
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,295
Hello. 
- Hello.

284
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,889
I'm on a break.

285
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,172
Thought I'd come by.
Check your security.

286
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,019
Great that you're concerned
for my security.

287
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,891
Come on in, let's see if
you're really that talentless.

288
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,896
I don't know.

289
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,177
I have no sense of rhythm.

290
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,092
Nobody is so unmusical

291
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,733
that they couldn't be
taught to dance.

292
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,896
You think so? 
- Sure. Let's go.

293
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,814
Come in!

294
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,649
Hello. 
- Hello.

295
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,011
Hi.

296
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,929
They are Rosanna and Karl.
They spend summer with us.

297
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,412
Hello, Karl. 
- Hello.

298
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,690
Hello, Rosanna.

299
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,298
Mr. Krookus, I heard that
you were robbed last night.

300
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,376
Yes I was.

301
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,498
Number of costly clocks they took,
those scoundrels.

302
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,892
Could we look for those clock-robbers?

303
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,616
Your dad is already handling this.

304
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,618
He came by last night,
photographed everything.

305
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,612
Dad is so busy all the time.

306
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,737
We have much more time.

307
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,216
And besides, we would also
like to solve cases.

308
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,219
Yearning for a true case.

309
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,938
So be it, young detectives.

310
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,773
I'm hiring you.

311
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,849
And if you catch those robbers

312
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,576
then I guarantee you free icecream
for the whole summer.

313
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,817
Deal! 
- Emilia and Karl,
you will check that corner.

314
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,538
Rosanna, you'll check
from over there.

315
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,539
I'm in charge of the whole operation.
- Maybe vice versa?

316
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,968
You'll check that corner over there.

317
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,212
And I'm in charge of the operation.
- OK, let's investigate together.

318
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,213
I found something.
- Wait, don't touch.

319
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,818
Mister Krookus, is this yours?

320
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,768
No, it's certainly not mine.

321
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,375
The bad guys probably dropped this.

322
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,812
Here are fingerprints.

323
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,178
Look what smart kids you are

324
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,016
I'll get the fingerprints.

325
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,299
Where did you learn this?
- Dad taught me.

326
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,336
We have two fingerprints.

327
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,369
How do you know whom
these belong to?

328
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,771
That we may find out through
police databank.

329
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,770
Only we have to get
to dad's office somehow.

330
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,818
Maybe you'll ask dad
to let you take a look?

331
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,816
Are you kidding?

332
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,693
He'll have a seizure if I step
near his work computer.

333
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,095
I've crashed it numerous times.

334
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,449
But let's do it like this!

335
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,575
Nobody's coming. Now!

336
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,728
Yes.

337
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,536
Stay there. I'll come right away.

338
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,777
Dammit!

339
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,892
There's one match.

340
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,091
Your dad is coming. Hurry!

341
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,652
Where on earth were you?

342
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,088
We were riding our bikes.

343
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,819
What happened? 
- What happened?!

344
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,688
You should have looked
after the small ones.

345
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,209
Emilia and Karl wandered around
and Karl fell in the water.

346
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,888
If he catches a cold I have
no idea what to tell Loviis.

347
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,692
My legs are melting.

348
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,016
Hang on, dear. You'll get
hot tea in a minute.

349
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,415
With raspberries and honey.

350
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,975
Did you find the owner
of the fingerprints?

351
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,370
Yes, we did. Your self-sacrifice
was worth it.

352
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,856
These belong to Roobert Uurike,
address Sambla 41.

353
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,575
After it gets dark, me and Markus will go there

354
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,815
Get lost!

355
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,334
So...

356
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,530
What is it?

357
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,014
Honorable teacher.

358
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,572
I believe I have found a way
to hasten healing of the wounds.

359
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,770
Oh?

360
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,975
This is a true miracle.

361
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,849
I would like to get so far that my
elixir would cure all illnesses.

362
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,692
Pure hokum. There is no cure
for the plague.

363
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,175
There is no cure for
your aching head.

364
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,777
Bishop demands gold.

365
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,973
Therefore I cannot allow you
to continue with the cure.

366
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,569
Look for the Sorcerer's Stone.
That will help us turn metal into gold.

367
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,412
Brother Johan. Don't worry,
I'll help you.

368
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,294
We will work on your elixir
at nights.

369
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,858
Where do you think you're going?

370
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,778
We want to come with you.

371
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,652
I told you, you're too small.

372
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,420
If you don't take us with you,
I'll scream.

373
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,493
Okay, you can come,
but no whining.

374
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,697
That photographer has rented
an apartment here.

375
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,256
Me and Rosanna will go first,
then you'll follow.

376
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,772
Let me tell you, Aivar.

377
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,979
We have to get a new dog.

378
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,974
I hate it when I don't know if someone's
sneaking around my house or not.

379
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,408
First time to have a dog's wake.

380
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,817
Bottoms up.

381
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,812
Wait! That sounded so familiar.

382
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,257
Exactly like the clock Mr. Krookus had.

383
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,974
Exactly. It came from there.

384
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,815
They are the ones who robbed
the clock of Mr. Krookus.

385
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,496
You're a really smart kid.

386
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,378
Tonis! 
- Yes?
- The kids are gone.

387
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,494
As long as they didn't go swimming
on their own.

388
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,895
We'll find them, don't worry.

389
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,259
There's an alarm all over the county.

390
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,655
Four kids on bikes cannot be
unseen for too long.

391
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,773
We'll look by the lighthouse as well.
- Okay.

392
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,330
Good day, officer Piir.
May I see your licence please.

393
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,300
You didn't see four kids on bicycles?

394
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,209
No sir, we didn't see
no kids anywhere, officer.

395
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,411
Please open the backdoor.

396
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,736
Sure, no problem.

397
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,892
We're transporting old furniture.

398
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,211
You can close this.

399
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,253
Drive safe. 
- Thanks! All the best to you as well.

400
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,612
Out of the car!

401
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,376
Face down, on the ground,
hands on your back.

402
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,576
Face down, face down.

403
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,255
Hands on your back!

404
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,337
Did you wind the clocks?

405
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,490
Well, yeah.

406
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,573
The sound is so beautiful.

407
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,970
Idiot.

408
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,250
If only you knew what
I had to live through.

409
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,690
I have a handful of grey hair.

410
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,811
But Mom, nothing happened to us.

411
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,732
But could have happened.

412
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,851
Besided, you're dying your hair anyway.

413
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,010
Thanks!

414
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:19,095
The only good thing here is
that kids caught the clock robbers.

415
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,212
A year's worth of work,
brother Johan,

416
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,532
But now it seems that the elixir
might be finally ready.

417
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,495
I hope it will be useful for people.

418
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,292
Whom shall we try it on first?

419
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,491
I want to test this on myself.

420
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,056
I'm a little ill. If I get better
then the cure has power.

421
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,296
All right. But please be careful!

422
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,730
We don't know about the side effects.

423
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,539
I can't breathe!

424
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,814
Johan!

425
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,210
Are you going to turn me in?

426
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,894
Don't be afraid!

427
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,414
So, you two, together again.

428
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,455
Jacob!

429
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,291
No more coughing.

430
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,370
Mom, how are you doing?

431
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,569
Fine. Dad visits me every day.

432
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,977
I'm, getting preparatory treatment
and I feel quite good.

433
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,414
When is the surgery?

434
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,934
Next week.

435
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,573
When are you getting out?

436
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,659
It'll be couple of more weeks after the
surgery and then we'll see each other.

437
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,852
I have to go now.

438
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,529
Time for my procedures,
nurse came.

439
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,299
Hugs and kisses.

440
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,775
See you!

441
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,739
Teacher. 
- Yes, what is it?

442
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,336
Here's a cure that can help
lots of people.

443
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,895
We prepared this with brother
Jacob at nights

444
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,415
I told you not to work
on the cure.

445
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,650
But ill people need to be cured,
there's a plague in town.

446
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,771
Teacher, we're asking
for your permission

447
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,938
To try this on the patients
of the hospital.

448
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,779
Because the cure may still have
dangerous side effects.

449
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,777
This is no cure.

450
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,972
That's poison, stirred by Devil's tail.

451
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,378
I cannot allow this.

452
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,935
We have to search for the
Sorcerer's Stone and make gold.

453
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,019
Bishop's patience is wearing thin.

454
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,734
Tests with the cure shall be postponed.

455
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,933
And remember this,

456
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,654
Alchemy is knowledge

457
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,569
about creation of the form
and its disappearance.

458
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,975
How is homunculus coming along?

459
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,934
Please.

460
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,376
Karl, 5 minutes is up,
it's my turn.

461
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,298
It's not yet 5 minutes.

462
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,417
Yes it is, give up the dog.

463
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,609
Take it!

464
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,458
That photographer again.

465
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,373
Why don't you like him?

466
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,935
I don't and that's it. Stuffing
his nose everywhere.

467
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,171
Siding up to Mom as well.

468
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,938
I think he's pretty cool.

469
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,216
Come! 
- What place is this?

470
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,456
It used to be monastery's library.

471
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,174
Now it's been empty for years.

472
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,814
Look!

473
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,729
I've collecting these things here,
one by one

474
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,733
We'll start making your
healing elixir here.

475
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,692
My father used to deal with alchemy.

476
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,415
After he died from the plague
I promised myself

477
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,180
that I will make an elixir
that would cure all illnesses.

478
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,774
When I saw you for the first time,

479
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,493
then I felt as if

480
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,248
I'd never seen a face more beautiful.

481
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,934
Higher. From the pose.

482
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,536
Grab me from here. Don't
be afraid, I won't bite. Now I feel.

483
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,619
From here it's lifted.

484
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,695
Fingers round my hand, strong,
knees slightly bent.

485
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,730
Dad!?

486
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,339
What's he doing here?

487
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,975
If my eyes are correct
then he's learning to tango.

488
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,649
But he hates dancing.

489
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,496
You got caught!

490
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,414
Dad, you're taking dance lessons!
- No.

491
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,336
Yes. But don't mention this to mom.

492
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,337
Do you want to surprise her?

493
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,538
Surprise is the right word.
Do we have a deal?

494
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,493
Heureka!

495
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,773
You are really at it.

496
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,050
It's you, Brother. Yes.

497
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,812
I found the solution

498
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,258
how to get even purer gold,
wrote down the formulas.

499
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,219
Excellent.

500
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,539
Are you going somewhere?

501
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,856
Yes, work-related.

502
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,859
Now?

503
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,255
I forgot to tell you.

504
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,054
Can you imagine what idea Stig had?

505
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:52,692
He wants to go to the castle at night,
to shoot it in moonlight.

506
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,850
And you're the one
who has to go with him?

507
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,490
Yes. Director's orders, to be
at his disposal around the clock.

508
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,378
He has to finish the book.

509
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,292
What choice do I have?

510
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,170
I've become downright
irreplacable for him

511
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,537
Feels like this Stig can't even
go to the bathroom without you.

512
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,939
Okay then, there he is.

513
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,491
I hope officer Fear isn't jealous.

514
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,335
No.

515
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,534
No reason to be. I'll be back
in couple of hours.

516
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,935
Ciao, don't be so grumpy.

517
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,379
You're still talking about coincidence,
dear Bonifacius.

518
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,010
Holy Father, this is the handywork
of Devil himself

519
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,737
Brother Evaristus was too close
to creating gold.

520
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,938
Vade retro satana

521
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,092
So it's Devil's work?

522
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,540
Then we have to catch this Devil

523
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,298
and string him up.

524
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,776
Holy Father, there's no way
to catch the Devil.

525
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,739
Man doesn't possess
such power over him.

526
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,171
Don't you understand,
this is done by a man?

527
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,019
We have to come up
with a clever plan

528
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,015
to catch this murderer
and gold robber.

529
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,774
We have to find a way

530
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,733
how to drive that sucky Stig
out of town for good.

531
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,851
Before he takes away our mom.

532
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,291
I think we should scare
that Stig properly.

533
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,014
He doesn't look like a guy
who's afraid of anything.

534
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,571
If he met the real White Lady
at the castle tonight

535
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,691
then I bet he would be scared.

536
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,771
Where do we get the White Lady?

537
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,052
I saw that Stig has a camera
with Wifi.

538
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,050
He sends all the pictures
over internet to his hard drive.

539
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,249
So?

540
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,692
Same time that he's
photographing the castle,

541
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,289
me and Markus
will go to his room.

542
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,333
I'll hack his computer and leave
him some ghost photos.

543
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,498
Karl, dad told you,
no more hacking.

544
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,339
You've had enough trouble
because of this already.

545
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,058
But if it's for the sake of justice?

546
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,894
What if that sucky Stig really
woos my Mom

547
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,738
and takes her away for good?

548
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,939
All right, but this is
the very last time.

549
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,695
Teacher!

550
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,539
Teacher, I managed to create gold!
- Show me.

551
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,014
The purest gold that
I have ever seen.

552
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,091
Do you remember the whole process? 
- Yes.

553
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:38,015
Write it all down so it remains
on the record forever.

554
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,694
Give me the gold recipe!

555
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,891
So you were the one
who killed all those monks?

556
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,898
That secret you shall take
to your grave.

557
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:26,976
You're the one who robbed formulas
and recipes for making gold.

558
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:32,616
Take him to the torture chamber,
he'll start talking.

559
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,891
Berit, what do you think if there's
any truth to this White Lady's tale?

560
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,819
I believe that every legend
is based on something.

561
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,735
White Lady or that young girl was really
buried somewhere within these walls?

562
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,613
I'm certain of it.

563
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,373
It was discovered that a girl dressed
as a boy had entered the castle

564
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,170
having an affair with
one of the monks

565
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,775
and these days it was punishable
by death.

566
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,854
Sad story.

567
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,212
I wouldn't be surprised if after this
a young girl's ghost would

568
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,458
haunt this place, appearing
on the window every year.

569
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,491
May I have a look? 
- No.

570
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,098
Of course you can.

571
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,849
Over here.

572
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,414
Come!

573
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,296
Can you? 
- Yes.

574
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,253
Look.

575
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,816
These are the files he is
photographing right now.

576
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,291
Photoshop some ghouls here.
E

577
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,819
These he would not believe.

578
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,218
I'll add an old lady's picture
and make it transparent.

579
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,651
Okay. I'll look around.

580
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,259
What?

581
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,730
Stig has a gun. 
- Show me

582
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,728
Put it back.

583
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,376
Look, if Stig sees this,

584
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,775
he'll be gone from this town
in a few hours.

585
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,175
Hang on.

586
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,456
Look. Here's a folder on Mr. Krookus.
Open it.

587
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,735
He has been following Mr. Krookus.

588
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,609
Karl, make a copy of this folder.

589
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:50,816
Yes.

590
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:54,895
We can go.

591
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,017
I don't want to be here.

592
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,530
Let me go.

593
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,053
Henricus

594
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,657
you have committed heinous murders.

595
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,619
Confess everything.

596
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,734
I have nothing to confess, Holy Father.

597
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,218
I don't know why I am here.

598
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,459
Tell us where did you hide the recipe
for making gold.

599
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:31,658
I know nothing, let me go.

600
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,815
Executioner, you're not doing
a proper job.

601
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,293
I confess.

602
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,054
I killed them all.

603
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,210
Me.

604
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,372
Why did you do it, brother?

605
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,850
Greed.

606
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,338
I... I wanted that...

607
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,491
only I would have instructions
for making gold.

608
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:11,620
That only I would know the
secret of the Sorcerer's Stone.

609
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:16,936
Tell us, where did you hide
the formula!

610
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,618
It's in my chamber.

611
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:26,977
There's a loose stone in the wall.

612
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,058
Behind it.

613
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,019
Mr. Krookus, we found
something really important.

614
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,774
Pictures of your clocks and you,
in a person's computer.

615
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,890
In addition to that,

616
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,819
He had a copy of a letter
by professor Feliks Truu.

617
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,055
The only thing familiar was
the name of Feliks Truu.

618
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,656
One time I bought some clocks
from his daughter.

619
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,178
Stamp albums, books

620
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:04,732
And his manuscript to the
White Lady's true story.

621
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,494
We printed out Feliks Truu's letter.

622
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,379
"My dear daughter,

623
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,771
if you're reading this, it means

624
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:23,292
You have discovered it inside
"Guide to photography's" back cover.

625
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,497
I hope you noticed our
secret marking on the back.

626
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,849
I want to tell you that inside
one of the clocks I hid

627
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,655
a very valuable treasure.

628
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:39,536
Find it and decide for yourself
what to do with it."

629
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:46,378
I believe we are really close
to creating the elixir.

630
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,571
Did you add enough garlic?

631
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,418
I believe so.

632
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,489
What is it?

633
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,657
It cannot start now.

634
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,099
Can it wait?

635
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,730
It's time, you have to help me.

636
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,858
I'll teach you.

637
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:09,372
I need clean clothes
and warm water.

638
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,696
Go on!

639
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,218
How is the gold-making
coming along?

640
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,969
What's the matter with Brother Johan?

641
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,098
Teacher, we have sinned.

642
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,419
What sin?

643
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,450
My real name is Johanna.

644
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,329
I hid that I'm a girl, or you wouldn't have
accepted me as an apprentice.

645
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,171
What are you looking at, you sinner!

646
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,649
Go bring a strong stick
and warm water.

647
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,579
And see that no-one finds out.

648
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,658
Feliks Truu wrote this letter
to his daughter

649
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,051
and hid it inside a book.

650
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,892
Wait, how did you get this?

651
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:31,651
We snuck into the house of Stig,
a photographer

652
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,971
and I hacked his computer

653
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:39,340
And Markus found a gun
belonging to that photographer.

654
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:42,972
Hello.

655
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,610
I have to show you something.
Can I come in? 
- Hello.

656
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,733
Hello. 
- Hi there.

657
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,609
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have barged
in early in the morning,

658
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,253
but it is really important.

659
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:59,817
I managed to catch White Lady
on a photo last night.

660
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,379
What are you talking about.
We never saw the White Lady.

661
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,496
But take a look at this photo.

662
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,093
I took this last night.

663
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:14,777
It is said that it is impossible
to see the ghosts in plain sight.

664
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:23,413
This must be the young girl
buried in the christening chapel.

665
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,255
That's the White Lady.

666
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,179
You're not taking this seriously?
These are just myths.

667
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,058
But this young woman's image
couldn't just, out of the blue

668
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:35,297
appear on the photograph.

669
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:40,455
That is strange. Maybe it's just
light effec t.

670
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,376
Doesn't look like it. Look, see.

671
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:47,812
I'm writing an article about this.

672
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,373
By God, White Lady finally
caught on a photograph.

673
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,613
No kids? Thought I'd show them
also the White Lady.

674
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,175
They went to see Mr. Krookus
about an hour ago.

675
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,416
There!

676
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,813
Working on some cases again?

677
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,012
No, just kids playing.
- They were very eager.

678
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,093
Well then, I'll go to write
that article.

679
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,938
No. Keep the photo.

680
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,853
Show it to kids as well.

681
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,339
Goodbye. 
- Goodbye.

682
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,412
Stig somehow got hold of
Feliks Truu's letters

683
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,220
and Stig hired robbers
to rob your clocks

684
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,694
to get the treasure.

685
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:31,410
That you have Feliks Truu's clocks,
he found out from the newspaper.

686
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:35,417
Truu's widow took many of his books
to the second-hand bookstore.

687
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,495
Stig probably bought

688
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,976
"Guide to Photography" from there.

689
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:45,890
Luckily your clocks are here.
- And treasure is inside one of them.

690
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,734
Mr. Krookus, we need to take
a look at your clocks.

691
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:00,969
Empty.

692
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,854
That was the last clock.

693
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:09,049
Maybe there's some somewhere else?
- I bought from Feliks Truu's daughter

694
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,891
five clocks. I remember that.

695
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,372
But I didn't buy all the clocks
from her.

696
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,338
Maybe she has some left.
- What is it?

697
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,652
Probably heard a cat.

698
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,214
This is what we'll do now.

699
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,419
How you're doing, Margit!

700
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:49,175
Oh, Herman, how nice to see you!

701
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,574
Likewise.

702
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,418
Come on in!

703
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,253
It's been ages since you came by.

704
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,291
Excuse us but we're in a hurry.

705
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,298
Is your husband home?

706
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:05,099
He's been living in Tallinn for years,
we divorced four years ago.

707
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,650
Oh, how sad.

708
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,929
Let me introduce you,

709
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:13,330
These are my young friends,
talented young detectives.

710
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,973
Detectives you say!?

711
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,338
Hello, detectives. 
- Hello.

712
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:21,453
Actually, we came
because of a clock.

713
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:26,012
That's funny, you're already a
second person today asking this.

714
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,173
10 minutes ago there was one buyer.

715
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,290
Please tell me you didn't
sell this clock?

716
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:35,692
Yes I did. He offered
such a good price.

717
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,937
And it was a complete wreck.

718
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:41,332
I really needed the money
to fix this place.

719
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,169
What did this buyer look like?

720
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,456
He was a nice and kind man,

721
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,016
distinguished, about 40,

722
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,058
dark hair, a real gentleman.

723
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,569
Men like that come by very seldom.

724
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,931
It had to be Stig. But how
did he know to come here?

725
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:05,538
Maybe he listened to us? Remember,
Nassu started barking.

726
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,897
Let's find Stig and see if he found
anything from the clock.

727
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:21,018
Take your daughter,
you sinner.

728
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:25,416
Looks like a healthy child.

729
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,056
Johanna

730
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,574
we have a daughter.

731
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:39,698
But now you have to run
before Bishop finds out.

732
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,697
Bishop and his soldiers.

733
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,212
Save my child.

734
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:52,488
I cannot save you but maybe
your child.

735
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:06,333
I heard terrible things,
Brother Bonifacius.

736
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,253
Yes, everything is correct.

737
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,409
Here these sinners are,
I heard about it just now.

738
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:20,498
A face too flawless,
eyes too beautiful.

739
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,049
I had to be a fool not noticing
this snake.

740
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,055
Where is the child?

741
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,375
Which child? 
- Don't be a fool.

742
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,299
Bonifacius, where is sinful fruit?

743
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,890
My eyes have seen no child.

744
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,979
I swear on Almighty, there was
a child in this room

745
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,060
Brother Gregorius
means Homunculus.

746
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:49,851
Look, Father, we managed to
complete the Homunculus.

747
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,379
Right now it's in early stages.

748
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:55,096
We'll deal with the Homunculus later.

749
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:59,613
Take the sinners
straight away to jail.

750
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:12,976
What am I going to do
with you, little one?

751
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,179
Now Stig gets the treasure and Feliks
Truu's daughter will lose everything.

752
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,571
So? 
- There was no treasure inside the clock.

753
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,098
Where's the right clock then?

754
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:56,056
Maybe Mrs. Truu has sold clocks
to someone else as well?

755
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,609
Hello. It's us again.

756
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:07,092
How nice, come in. 
- Sorry, but we're in a hurry.

757
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,890
Say, you didn't sell anyone else
any of your father's clocks?

758
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:16,012
Yes, a long time ago I sold another one. 
- To whom?

759
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,895
One big round clock was bought
by Haapsalu's railway museum.

760
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:23,610
I know that clock.
It's in the station's main hall.

761
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:27,453
Thank you, Margit. 
- What is it with these clocks?

762
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,409
Can't tell you now. Soon
you'll find out everything.

763
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,493
Don't ask me where did I get her.

764
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,895
Please raise her for a few months

765
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,534
until my work here is finished.
Go now.

766
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,210
How can we get it?

767
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,498
I don't know, let's ask the guard.

768
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:18,009
Nobody will allow us
to take down that clock.

769
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,212
But at night there's nobody here.

770
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,936
Let's hide under the benches
and when the doors close,

771
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,495
We'll take the clock down and see
if there's a treasure inside.

772
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,452
I don't know if it's the best idea?

773
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:33,176
But Feliks Truu's daughter is so poor
and her house needs fixing up.

774
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:35,769
Yes, that's true.

775
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,968
All right.

776
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,179
Let's do this.

777
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:44,816
Wait, wait.

778
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,574
Where are you going?

779
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:50,253
Herman promised to
teach us astronomy.

780
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,179
He'll show us Moon's craters
through his telescope.

781
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:56,292
Tonight is full moon. 
- And it's supposed to be clear sky.

782
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,930
I'm afraid you'll wear
uncle Herman out.

783
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,450
Mom, uncle Herman is our friend.

784
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,373
And he's really happy
when we visit him

785
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,457
because he himself invited us.

786
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,179
Tonis, what do you think?

787
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,169
Let them go, kids'll have fun.

788
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,290
Okay, but take your phones.

789
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,371
I'll call Herman and check.

790
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,451
Why do you worry for them so much?

791
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,855
Bon appetit!

792
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,095
By what right?

793
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:57,690
Okay.

794
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,335
That was Stig, I know.
- You bet!

795
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,373
He probably found out from Margit
where another clock was.

796
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:15,695
Where did he get the key from?

797
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,050
Maybe stole from the guard?
- Or made a copy?

798
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,858
Let's call dad! 
- No!

799
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:22,933
Then he'll know that we lied.
- Kids!

800
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:26,777
The situation is bad,
but not hopeless.

801
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,053
He locked us up.

802
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,170
We have to stay here
until morning.

803
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,618
Then we'll see.

804
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,294
Stig has gotten the treasure
from the clock anyway.

805
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,373
I'd like to know what treasure
it was in the clock.

806
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:25,695
Maybe diamonds.

807
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,852
I don't think that Feliks Truu
would have had diamonds.

808
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,098
They were so poor.

809
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:34,014
What would have been the point
to hide the treasure?

810
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,772
I'm listening. 
- Hello, Herman.

811
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,776
I'm calling because of my father's clock.

812
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,416
I remembered that Dad
had one more clock.

813
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:47,809
What?

814
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,656
One more clock? 
- Yes.

815
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:54,455
I'm right coming over,
with young detectives...

816
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:55,769
And Margit,

817
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,691
please don't tell anyone
about this clock.

818
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:10,216
Good morning, Margit!
- Hello Herman, hi kids!

819
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,456
Please, come on in.

820
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,255
Kids,

821
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,094
take your shoes off.

822
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,893
I kept it in the shed.

823
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:23,173
Dad wouldn't allow me
to throw it out.

824
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,413
Margit, now's the time to
tell you everything -Yes?

825
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,617
We're looking for a valuable treasure.

826
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,816
A treasure hidden in one of your clocks.

827
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:33,739
In my clock? Who hid it there?

828
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,455
With your permission we'd like
to open the clock now.

829
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,617
Of course. 
- Boys!

830
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,458
Look! 
- Treasure!

831
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:00,098
It's written by the hand
of monk Bonifacius.

832
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:02,448
Unbelievable!

833
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:06,337
It's worth much more
than gold or diamonds.

834
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,299
This is for you.

835
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,490
"My dear daughter,

836
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:22,574
story of the White Lady
I told you is all true...

837
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:26,735
During the archaeological dig
I managed to uncover

838
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,939
The diary of monk-alchemist
Bonifacius.

839
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,935
There he describes what happened

840
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:40,610
in the Bishop's castle of Haapsalu
between 1472 and 1474.

841
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:44,974
Based on this I wrote the
"True story of the White Lady".

842
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:50,374
Turns out my Dad's book
was based on reality.

843
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:51,889
Turns out.

844
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,455
"Alchemist Bonifacius

845
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:58,369
hid in the Bishop's castle
the instructions for making gold.

846
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:04,018
He created an intricate light effect
that shows once a year

847
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:07,532
with full moon the place
where it is hidden...

848
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:12,449
Unfortunately my healt
is too weak to look for it

849
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,776
and the season is not right.

850
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:18,019
If you can, please look
for those instructions.

851
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:20,417
Your loving dad."

852
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:25,540
Stig! 
- Margit!

853
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:29,054
Don't tell him that we're here.

854
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,418
That is a very dangerous man.

855
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,890
He wants to get your father's treasure.

856
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:35,650
Hello!

857
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:39,451
Me again, because of those clocks.

858
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:40,854
Hello-hello.

859
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:43,972
Maybe that's the treasure map? 
- No.

860
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:47,209
That's Bishop's castle's blueprint.

861
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:50,577
See. That's the christening chapel.

862
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:52,815
Right.

863
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:56,012
Tell me, did your father leave you
any more clocks?

864
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,376
All that I had I sold.

865
01:04:58,700 --> 01:04:59,815
That's a pity.

866
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:12,495
Here is written in Latin:
"Look for it in August, at full moon."

867
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:21,659
White Lady will show you the way.

868
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,337
Oh, well, have a great day, Missis.
- Have a nice day.

869
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:35,008
We have to find that treasure.
- That's exactly what we'll do.

870
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:42,455
Let's meet a little before midnight
at the museum's front door.

871
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,171
How do we get in there?

872
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,377
My mom has the museum's keys
and I have a copy.

873
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:54,098
Sorry to interrupt, I'm so glad
that you want to help me,

874
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:56,900
but isn't this too dangerous?
- Margit, don't worry.

875
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,371
We're used to danger. Right, kids?

876
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:02,809
Of course.

877
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:06,172
I'm sure that Johanna and Jacob
managed to make gold

878
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:09,373
and that it is buried somewhere
in the chapel...

879
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,611
If only it was already midnight.

880
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,890
Maid Johanna.

881
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:24,254
You have violated
our sacred rules that state

882
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:30,257
that no woman shall ever
set foot inside the castle.

883
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:35,177
Therefore we are sentencing you

884
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:38,498
in the name of the divine power.

885
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:43,178
What is the punishment for the sinner?

886
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,173
Death.

887
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,698
The same goes for you, Jacob

888
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:57,292
You have sinned and
concealed this from us.

889
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:01,612
What shall be his punishment?

890
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,732
Death.

891
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:09,657
Hereby we sentence,

892
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,893
that Johanna

893
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,691
shall be walled up alive

894
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,935
into the wall of the christening chapel.

895
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:29,774
Monk Jacob shall be executed.
Sentence will be carried out immediately.

896
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:46,453
Hello. Your name must be?
- Yes, hello.

897
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,972
I need to talk to your mother.

898
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:50,979
Kids, go play.

899
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:55,691
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

900
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:58,778
What are you talking about,
you're not interrupting.

901
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:00,499
Hello. 
- Hello.

902
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:03,729
I see that you have read
my article.

903
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:06,494
Yes, I did and it was
simply amazing...

904
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:08,213
One agency wishes

905
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,809
That I would take White Lady's photo
tonight, at the same place.

906
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:15,412
I'm sure that tonight, with
full moon, she will reappear.

907
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,657
Tell me, Berit, could you come
to the castle with me tonight?

908
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:23,609
Of course, no problem. You made
our castle world famous.

909
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,816
I'm sure it'll be crowded tonight.

910
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:29,053
If you don't mind I'd like to join you.
I have an evening off.

911
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:31,695
Fabulous.

912
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:33,739
See you at midnight.

913
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:36,178
Goodbye. 
- Goodbye.

914
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:38,088
Yes, this is Piir.

915
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:41,890
Okay. I'll drive there straight away.

916
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:45,297
Don't tell me that you can't come
to see White Lady with us.

917
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,856
I've been called to Dirham.
- I just had to marry a policeman.

918
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,091
There's nothing you can do about it now.

919
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:54,770
I think you won't be bored with
those ghouls and ghostbusters, right?

920
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:57,178
I'll come to pick you up afterwards.

921
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:03,939
You're not even ready yet?

922
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:08,010
We don't want to see the White Lady.
- We've seen her every year.

923
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:12,219
You've always waited for this anxiously.
Rosanna and Karl?

924
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:14,411
We'll go to bed earlier today.

925
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:17,088
Yes. And we're very tired.

926
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:21,292
As you wish. I'm surprised.

927
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:49,734
No! No! No!

928
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:01,054
You won't get in trouble with your mom?

929
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:05,649
White Lady's treasure
is more important. 
- Agreed.

930
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:40,572
Dear child, I brought you
something to eat and drink.

931
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:50,173
But I can't help you out as
there are guards everywhere.

932
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,253
How is Jacob?

933
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:55,339
He was executed.

934
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:57,375
But my child?

935
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:00,772
She's fine. She's at my sister's.

936
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:07,017
I can no longer come,
but I promise you this,

937
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:10,650
That I'll take care of your little girl
as if she was my own flesh and blood.

938
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:14,979
Here is the cure.

939
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:18,410
It will grant you sleep,
without any pain.

940
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:20,969
Johanna.

941
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,729
What should I do with your instructions
for making gold?

942
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:27,817
Minul seda enam vaja ei lahe.

943
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:32,048
Koige rohkem kahetsen ma seda,
et ma oma eliksiiri katsetada ei saanud.

944
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:34,417
I'll hide it in such a place,

945
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,059
your instructions,

946
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:39,777
where nobody will be able
to find it for some time.

947
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,929
And you shall show them
the way,

948
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,928
where this priceless treasure lies...

949
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:47,769
Goodbye.

950
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:49,848
Go with God, Johanna.

951
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:04,051
Berit, I have a huge request.

952
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:07,452
Would it be possible to take
a few shots inside the castle?

953
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:11,730
No. At nights we don't let
the visitors in.

954
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:18,009
But since you've done such
a great job promoting our castle,

955
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:19,978
Then I'll have to make an exception.

956
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,733
Come this way.

957
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:57,734
White Lady should appear
within 15 minutes.

958
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:01,458
Hide, quickly!

959
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,736
This is the christening chapel

960
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:10,295
And that's the window where
White Lady will appear on.

961
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:12,734
That's an optical trick.

962
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:16,418
I'm more interested in the basement
where she was walled in.

963
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,249
Do you have the key?

964
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:21,770
Of course. Come with me.

965
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:29,650
Lucky.

966
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:34,258
Let them go and look in the basement,
then they won't disturb us.

967
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:53,418
If Bonifacius is right,

968
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,938
then something is about to start.

969
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:01,655
See!

970
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,292
The White Lady

971
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:17,973
points at this stone here.

972
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:25,650
Help me to lift it.

973
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:55,495
Hold this.

974
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:04,735
That's Johanna's instruction
for making gold

975
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:13,658
and recipe for the curing elixir.

976
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:15,979
And gold.

977
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,497
And lots of it.

978
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,817
Margit Truu has now enough
money to fix her home.

979
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:26,894
I'm afraid not.

980
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,294
Children!

981
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:45,610
Nassu, where are you running, wait.

982
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:49,170
Wait, where are you going now?

983
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:52,254
Where do you want to go? Wait!

984
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,855
Faster. Go, go.

985
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:03,536
Those are my Mom's keys.
- Sharp eye, detective.

986
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:09,528
You know, Stig? Locking me
down here isn't funny. 
- Silence!

987
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:11,538
Inside! Quickly!

988
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,331
Kids, what are you doing here?

989
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:19,098
That man's a robber, Mom.
- Harsh words, young man...

990
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,775
I don't understand anything anymore!

991
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,290
You'll have plenty of time
to catch up.

992
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:28,939
Mom, Stig is getting away with the
treasure, you have to do something!

993
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:31,973
Let him go, main thing is
that you're alive

994
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,889
You don't understand anything!

995
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:38,377
We found Johanna's instructions
for making gold

996
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:42,289
and a little gold and now
you're just letting him go.

997
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:46,209
We have to get out of here right now

998
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:49,339
And we have to catch
this no good robber.

999
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,970
Markus, where did you get these?

1000
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,972
Later, Mom.

1001
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,569
Okay, open this door very quietly.

1002
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:14,050
What's this supposed to mean?
- Wait-wait.

1003
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:17,653
It means that you're going
through that door.

1004
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:20,328
If you're lucky, you'll meet
your family.

1005
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:13,736
Me, monk-alchemist Bonifacius

1006
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:18,339
Wrote this down in the year
of our Lord 1481.

1007
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:23,889
Since I don't want the manuscript
to fall into wrong hands

1008
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:28,332
I shall hide it into the floor
of the Bishop's castle.

1009
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:31,693
I hope that some day it will
end up in good hands.

1010
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:45,335
Praise the Lord!

1011
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:51,854
Mom, we found Johanna's
instructions for making gold.

1012
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,255
And a little bit of gold.

1013
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:56,970
She did numerous curing elixirs,
you could get better with these.

1014
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,935
Dear kids, I'm really grateful,

1015
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:02,938
But it seems I'm already getting better.

1016
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:06,377
Doctor told me this morning that
the tests have improved vastly.

1017
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:07,535
Finally!

1018
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,810
We thought with dad that his vacation
is about to start

1019
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:13,171
And you could come home.
Next week already.

1020
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,735
Rosanna, why am I not hearing cheering?

1021
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:21,179
I thought that if we're not there
on the way,

1022
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,576
then dad can take better care of you.

1023
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:26,214
Yes. It would be much more peaceful
if there's just two of you.

1024
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:29,698
Is it really about this?

1025
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:32,368
Actually we started to like it here

1026
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:35,174
and we'd like to stay in Haapsalu
until the end of the Summer.

1027
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:50,171
Would you care to dance?

1028
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:52,657
But you can't dance.

1029
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:57,409
Go, mom, you have to go.

1030
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:35,614
I had no idea you could dance. Amazing!

1031
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:17,851
Dad, can we go fishing now?

1032
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,818
Of course.

1033
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:21,931
Are we gonna catch a big one today?

1034
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:27,897
Very big. 
- How do you know that?

1035
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:32,329
Because we've earned this.
