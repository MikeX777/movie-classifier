1
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,549
Where are you?
Can you come and get me?

2
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,879
Zahra dear...

3
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,758
Salt! Bread!

4
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,437
Zahra dear! Massoumeh dear!
We have to go.

5
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,798
Where's my husband?

6
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,430
Salt!

7
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,832
Bread! Salt!

8
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,597
To the director
of the Welfare Department.

9
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,231
We hereby inform you
that in Valiasr, Tehran,

10
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,792
on the road to Saveh,
at No. 10 Sajadi Avenue,

11
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,352
lives - or rather survives -
a family made up of a man,

12
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,991
a blind woman
and two 12-year-old girls.

13
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,631
The two girls
have never been out of the house.

14
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,317
Even their door is locked.

15
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,076
They cannot speak.

16
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,871
They haven't had a bath for years.

17
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,671
All the neighbors
are complaining about the situation,

18
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,311
but no one dares intervene.

19
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,711
So, we, the undersigned,

20
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,432
request you to take urgent action.

21
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,473
A film by Samira Makhmalbaf

22
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,753
Screenplay and editing:
Mohsen Makhmalbaf

23
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,314
THE APPLE

24
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,310
You've enough to live on.

25
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,199
But you lock up your children and leave!

26
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,112
lsn't that right?

27
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,519
lf you want to see your children,
l'll take you.

28
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,957
Your poor girls are innocent!

29
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,273
Madam,

30
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,670
do what you can
to let their mother see them.

31
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,196
All right.
First, let me see their mother.

32
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,433
- She says they'll hurt her children.
- l'll do what l can.

33
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,877
We don't hurt children.
Open the door.

34
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,079
The neighbors filed a complaint
with the Welfare Department,

35
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,989
so we took action.

36
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,832
You wouldn't let the neighbors
take the girls to the public baths.

37
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,710
They haven't been washed in ages.

38
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,988
Zahra, Massoumeh, come here.

39
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,039
Can we go in? You go first.

40
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,712
These children have no contact
with the outside world.

41
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,996
What?

42
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,439
- What's that?
- A glass.

43
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,557
What's in it?

44
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,872
What's your name?

45
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,719
What?

46
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,197
Massoumeh? How old are you?

47
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,671
Massoumeh, how old are you?

48
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,237
Mom... mo...

49
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,310
You want to see your mom?

50
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,030
What about you, Massoumeh?
Do you want to see mom?

51
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,995
- For God's sake...
- That's why we did it!

52
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,708
They must have a future,
a role in society.

53
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,030
They should get married.

54
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,510
l'll look after them at home.

55
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,629
The fact is, they're prisoners.

56
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,198
For years now,
they've been living like prisoners.

57
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,274
Even prisoners are allowed fresh air.
But they're not!

58
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,990
Their father locks them up all day.

59
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,197
Do you want to go to school?

60
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:40,393
A lot of children
with blind parents go to school.

61
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,470
Even orphans go to school.
How do they manage?

62
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,109
lt's Fate, it's destiny.

63
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,990
You're tired.
l'll bring you some water.

64
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,789
They say:
''lf the morning sun doesn't warm you,

65
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,508
the evening sun won't.''

66
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,713
Well done. Do the same shape.

67
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,838
Look how l do it.

68
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,198
Of course,

69
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,994
if they'd studied like other children,

70
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,313
both l and society would benefit.
But that's the way it is.

71
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,870
You didn't let them study.

72
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,951
lt's my fault,
l'm not saying it isn't.

73
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,075
Shall we go home?

74
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,069
Let's go see the children first.

75
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,153
Do you want to?

76
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,235
Do you want to see them?
Do you?

77
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,030
These girls are twins.

78
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,669
Should they be apart from their family?

79
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,471
We visited them on two occasions
and concluded

80
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,349
that in this case,
we had to remove them.

81
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,270
Do you want to take the children home
or stay with them?

82
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,239
Don't worry.

83
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,396
We'll take good care of the children.

84
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,636
Zahra, who's this?

85
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,034
Massoumeh, come here.

86
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,629
Go kiss her.

87
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,031
lt's Zahra. Are you Zahra?

88
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,950
Good girl, Zahra.

89
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,276
Why don't you come home?

90
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,352
Where's your headscarf?

91
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,398
We took it off to wash her hair

92
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,312
and clean her up.

93
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,028
We changed their clothes.

94
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,313
Zahra, come over here too.

95
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,278
Bring a scarf to cover her head.

96
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,352
Little bitches.

97
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,077
l'm not insulting anybody.

98
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,278
Bring a scarf,

99
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,953
so we can go home.

100
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,275
Give me my children!

101
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,230
l promise l'll wash them.

102
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,393
Do you promise?

103
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,993
Then l'll let you take them.

104
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,878
Why did you take off their scarves?

105
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,352
To wash and cut their hair.

106
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,552
Come on. Let's go.

107
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,112
Don't cry.

108
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,994
Come on, husband, let's go.

109
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,312
We clothed them.

110
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,913
Let's go home!

111
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,435
They're her children...

112
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,591
Zahra dear... Let's go home.

113
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,673
She's Massoumeh. That's Zahra.

114
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,278
Let's go home.

115
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,998
They said
not to lock the door anymore,

116
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,118
that they must be allowed out.

117
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,278
You can take the children home,

118
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,318
but you mustn't lock the door anymore.

119
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,997
We'll fix the refrigerator
so we can drink cold water.

120
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,151
We'll be just fine.

121
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,836
l'll take the children
to the public baths.

122
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,594
l'll pay to have them washed.

123
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,718
lf we do all that,
we can keep them.

124
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,351
We have to keep them clean,
or they'll be taken off us again.

125
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,675
Flowers.

126
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,154
Flowers!

127
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,719
Help me, husband, l'm scared.

128
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,800
You see, my girl,

129
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,350
l put the saucepan on the stove.

130
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,632
Forgive me...

131
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,591
lf l'm teaching you this...

132
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,508
There are four of us.

133
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,428
For me,

134
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,115
you take a full glass of rice.
You pour it in.

135
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,634
Do you understand?

136
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,551
For your mother,
you don't quite fill it.

137
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,716
For you, you half-fill it

138
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,157
and for Massoumeh, the same.

139
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,353
Look carefully!

140
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,356
Here's a full glass.

141
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,158
That's for me.

142
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,079
You pour it in.

143
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,109
That's for me.

144
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,593
Watch now!

145
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,031
When you get married,

146
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,714
you'll have to know how to cook.

147
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,599
Then, people won't say:

148
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,389
''Because of her blind mother,
she never learnt anything.''

149
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,198
So, you watch me!

150
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,072
God made woman
for her to marry.

151
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,189
What's that?

152
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,313
God made woman
for her to marry.

153
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,753
She mustn't remain alone.

154
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,598
l don't want people to say:

155
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,350
''Her mother was blind,
so she never learnt anything.''

156
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,031
lsn't that right, Zahra?

157
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,632
- l didn't want to come see you.
- Why?

158
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,111
Because you slandered me.

159
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,271
That's very serious.

160
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,080
l won't forgive you.
And nor will God.

161
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,357
What you said were lies...

162
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,679
...that l didn't let my daughters out,

163
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,672
that l chained them up!

164
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,993
That is slander.
The person who said that was wrong.

165
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,834
But everyone knows
that for eleven years,

166
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,834
you imprisoned your children
and didn't feed them properly.

167
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,119
Everyone says
you didn't look after your children.

168
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,549
l've been slandered.

169
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,112
ln the whole country, on TV,
in the press, it's all they talk about.

170
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,155
lsn't it good that the Welfare
Department looks after your daughters?

171
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,356
lt's good for all of you.

172
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,433
l wasn't the only one to take action.

173
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,110
Everyone's pointing me out.

174
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,433
But you did lock them up
for eleven years, didn't you?

175
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,309
l kept them at home,
l'm not saying l didn't.

176
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:32,031
l didn't send them to school.
But l didn't chain them up.

177
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,759
lt's slander.

178
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,678
Why am l being dishonored?

179
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,879
Being chained up
and being locked up at home

180
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,872
is the same thing!

181
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,870
People say: ''He was on TV
and in the papers.

182
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,553
He chained his kids up!''

183
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,588
But they were locked up.
The rest is unimportant.

184
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,593
No, it is important!

185
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,353
You dishonored me.

186
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,030
l didn't chain my kids up.
lt's all lies.

187
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,229
There's no difference
between chained up

188
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,632
and not seeing the sun for eleven years!

189
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,868
l'll pay you
to pray for my children.

190
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,874
No, even if you gave me a million,
l wouldn't take it.

191
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,680
l don't want your money.

192
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,311
l won't take it
because of all these lies.

193
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,319
Pray for my children.

194
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,875
l mean to say...

195
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,876
the newspapers wrote
that l chained up my children...

196
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,793
- Don't cry.
- Why would l have done that?

197
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,114
Their mother's blind. She locked
the door, so they wouldn't get out.

198
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,114
But why did you slander me?

199
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,715
l won't forgive you,

200
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,632
and nor will God.
l'm humiliated. l'm so angry.

201
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,791
ln this heat,
everyone's drinking water,

202
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,640
has a fan, or air conditioning.

203
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,190
But l don't. l have
enough worries. Don't add to them.

204
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,116
Neither God nor the Prophet
will forgive you.

205
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,198
l'll leave you the money. Goodbye.

206
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,078
Massoumeh, my dear,
Zahra, my dear...

207
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,875
One of you can wash the clothes,

208
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,190
the other can take the broom

209
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,795
and sweep the yard.

210
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,828
Otherwise the social worker
will say you haven't learnt anything,

211
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,719
that you haven't washed,
that you're dirty.

212
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,838
She'll take you back and keep you.

213
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,958
Go on, girls.
One of you wash the clothes

214
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,351
and the other clean the yard.
l'll make the meal.

215
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,558
Well done, girls.
See to the clothes.

216
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,950
Zahra, wash the clothes.

217
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,594
lce cream!
Delicious ice cream!

218
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,398
Come see!

219
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,231
lce cream!
Delicious ice cream!

220
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,269
lce cream!

221
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,910
l want...

222
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,078
Delicious ice cream!

223
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,911
Do you want one?

224
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,671
That one? Give me the money.

225
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,474
Which one do you want?
This one or that one?

226
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,595
10 tomans. Which do you want?

227
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,554
- Go get the money.
- l don't have any.

228
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,792
- 10 tomans.
- l don't have any.

229
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,070
- So you don't get an ice cream.
- Give it to me.

230
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,273
Give me the money.
10 tomans, 10 tomans.

231
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,192
l don't have any money.

232
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,429
10 tomans.

233
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,593
So, go away.

234
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,719
Go away if you don't have any.

235
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,074
Zahra dear!

236
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,514
Massoumeh!

237
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,034
Come eat!

238
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,313
Come on!

239
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,439
Hurry up!

240
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,240
Massoumeh, here you are.

241
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,313
Zahra dear, eat up.

242
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,110
l don't want any... l'm tired.

243
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,035
''O God, l am weary,

244
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,432
''weary of this life.

245
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,199
''l have had enough of this earthly life.

246
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,519
''Direct me to the gates of death

247
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,675
''O God

248
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,317
''Or free me

249
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,075
''from all my chains.

250
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,911
''ln the prison of misfortune

251
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,632
''l have been buried.

252
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,475
''Alas, l never understood
what l did wrong

253
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:19,830
''My God, l have never complained
about my solitude

254
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,075
''For it has always been my destiny...

255
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,355
Yes?

256
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,349
l came to see your neighbor.

257
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,194
He has shut his door and gone.

258
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,829
- Are you Mrs Farokh's son?
- Yes.

259
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,433
ls your mother home?

260
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,277
No.

261
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,238
How can l see the children?

262
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,229
- l'll bring you a ladder.
- Thank you.

263
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,230
Careful.

264
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,833
See what's going on over there.

265
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,552
The kids are locked up.

266
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,109
Let me climb up.

267
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,951
Hold my notebook.

268
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,238
Hello, children.
How are you, Zahra?

269
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,473
- Hello, madam, how are you?
- Why did you let them come back?

270
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,952
They must be educated outside
and by their family, too.

271
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,077
- You did the right thing.
- Thanks.

272
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,990
Their father locked them up and left.

273
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,355
- Can you open the door?
- Yes.

274
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,153
Thank you very much.

275
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,913
Hello, children. How are you?

276
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,196
What's that?

277
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,510
A spoon. Let's see.

278
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,955
You OK? What are you doing?

279
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,636
- Prisoner...
- Prisoner? Why?

280
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,678
- The door's locked.
- Locked?

281
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,354
- Where's your father?
- l don't know.

282
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,591
Why these spoons?

283
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,836
What?

284
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,710
To hit? What for?

285
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,756
l see. ls there anything you want?

286
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,228
Apple.

287
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,677
OK, next time l come.

288
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,516
This time, l brought something pretty
so you can see yourselves.

289
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,472
This is for you...

290
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,075
and that's for you, dear.

291
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,630
l also brought you a comb

292
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,077
to comb your lovely hair.

293
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,835
Hello.

294
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,594
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

295
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,034
Are you well?

296
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,679
Where were you?

297
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,194
l went shopping.

298
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,830
You promised not to lock
the children up anymore.

299
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,475
- l had to.
- You had to!

300
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,757
- Well, yes, ma'am.
- No, you didn't.

301
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,879
l look after the house
and l have to do the shopping.

302
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,839
Their mother can't go anywhere.

303
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,517
l can't leave my family to starve.

304
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,149
l have to buy bread and ice.

305
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,072
l bought some ice.

306
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,757
l have hot bread in one hand
and ice in the other.

307
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,196
What else could l do?

308
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,876
Leave the children in the yard.

309
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,829
Ask the neighbor
to keep an eye on them.

310
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,674
We talked about this. You promised.

311
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,433
Your girls are back home.

312
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,240
You should treat them better than this.

313
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,394
lf l don't lock the door,
boys climb over the wall.

314
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,552
Their ball falls in our yard,
they want it back,

315
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,995
so, they climb over the wall.

316
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,993
l can't let the girls play in the yard.

317
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,879
lf anyone touched them,
l'd be dishonored.

318
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,031
You could lock the front gate

319
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,955
and ask the neighbor
to keep an eye on them.

320
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,398
Oh, the neighbor! She doesn't care!

321
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,553
She knows
that my refrigerator is broken.

322
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,351
No one brings me any ice, even though
my refrigerator doesn't work.

323
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,794
l had to...

324
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,994
- You see...
- l'll take the key.

325
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,153
You should understand what it's like
to be cut off from people.

326
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,597
You'll see what it feels like.

327
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,877
We talked it over, but it did no good.

328
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,190
Go out, children. Go on.

329
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,911
Go play in the street
like the other children.

330
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,717
Go play outside like them.
Go on. Off you go.

331
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,432
That's enough.

332
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,871
You should go out by yourselves!

333
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,989
So...

334
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,790
we'll see how you like
being shut in!

335
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,356
They're so used to being locked up
that they come back.

336
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,832
Go back outside.
Go on, off you go.

337
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,839
Soghra!

338
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,998
Come here.

339
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,472
Look after the kids
before they get run over.

340
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,471
Let me go see them.

341
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,473
Son-of-a-bitch!
They'll get into trouble.

342
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,675
No insults now.

343
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,593
Why did you let them go outside?

344
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,515
lf you don't change your attitude,
l won't let them stay.

345
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,159
l'll take them away.

346
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,789
You let them go outside.

347
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,359
You heard what she said!

348
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,637
Zahra, Massoumeh, come here.

349
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,873
They won't come back!
l won't let them come back.

350
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,872
They've been set free.

351
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:36,877
She says you won't let them go free,
you lock them up...

352
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,912
and you don't let them out.

353
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,312
Soghra, l told you already.
l wanted to take you to see the doctor.

354
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,235
You should get out
and talk to your neighbors!

355
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,994
This is no life!

356
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,994
Ask for the key
so you can get the kids.

357
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,435
You're not dumb, ask her.

358
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:02,312
No, l won't give it to you
until you promise not to lock them up.

359
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,758
l won't open this door.
You'll stay here.

360
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,312
lf anything happens, too bad!
lt's better than their life in here.

361
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,551
Soghra... speak.

362
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,360
- l already asked her.
- No, l refuse!

363
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,230
You see...

364
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,715
l didn't lock them up,
they came back.

365
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,794
Even when l open the door
so they can get some air,

366
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,678
they lock themselves in.

367
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,871
You taught them to.

368
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,078
- No, it's them...
- You taught them to do it.

369
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,238
Their mother's blind,
she can't go anywhere.

370
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,311
That's just an excuse.

371
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,312
Go back outside, children.

372
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,397
l've had enough.
Go out and make some friends.

373
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,790
lce cream!

374
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,110
Delicious ice cream!

375
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,510
Come see!

376
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,559
lce cream!

377
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,634
- Want one?
- Yes.

378
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,514
- You have to pay.
- l ca...

379
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,149
Pay for the ice cream.

380
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,435
Now it's melted,
you want to give it back?

381
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,232
Come on, hurry up.

382
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,277
What do you want, kid?

383
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,549
Now the ice cream's melted,
you want to give it back?

384
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,400
- What do you want?
- She didn't pay.

385
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,437
- How much is it?
- 20 tomans.

386
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,679
She was locked up for 11 years.
Can't you leave her alone?

387
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,319
She won't pay me.

388
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,676
- How much did you say?
- 20 tomans.

389
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,115
Wait, l'll pay you.

390
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,909
- You were locked up for 11 years?
- Yes.

391
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,711
That's no reason
not to pay for your ice cream!

392
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,029
Here.

393
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,679
That's for her ice cream.

394
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,272
That's for her sister's

395
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,710
and that's for you.

396
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,353
Now, don't fight.

397
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,397
Here, this is for your sister.

398
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,075
l'll give you mine.

399
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,638
What's that for?

400
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,555
Thank you.

401
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,073
Here.

402
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,074
Drink some water. You must be tired.

403
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,359
lt's hot in the sun. Drink it.

404
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:08,273
l already fed the children.

405
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,069
l wasn't feeling too good,

406
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,595
so l didn't eat.

407
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,199
lf you like,
we can eat together now.

408
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,552
Please go ahead.

409
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,555
l told you...
l have to lock the door,

410
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,555
because the kids' ball
comes over the wall.

411
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,109
They ring the bell.

412
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,515
No one answers,
so they climb the wall.

413
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,116
l have to lock the door
for my girls' sake.

414
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,631
l don't know what l'd do
if anything happened to them.

415
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,919
- Throw us our ball, please.
- We're sorry.

416
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,269
We'll be careful.

417
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,834
Thank you.

418
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,434
The problem is that they're girls.

419
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,352
lf they'd been boys,

420
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,831
they'd go out with you.
They'd play outside.

421
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,231
And they'd even climb walls.

422
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,788
- Do you know ''Advice to Fathers''?
- No.

423
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,076
Know what it says about girls?

424
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,472
Here, read what it says about girls.

425
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,639
lt says: ''A girl is like a flower.

426
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,236
lf the sun shines on her,
she will fade.''

427
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:46,798
A man's gaze is like the sun
and a girl is like a flower.

428
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,191
lt's like putting cotton next to a fire:

429
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,113
it will be consumed.

430
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,839
Did you go to school?

431
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,037
lt was the old method.

432
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,278
l studied for four winters.

433
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,953
At which school?

434
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:08,475
lt was at a friend's house...
lt was the old method.

435
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,678
There wasn't school in those days.

436
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,913
What's your job?

437
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,196
l don't have one.

438
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,592
People give me money,

439
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,277
friends and others
give me rice and oil...

440
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,671
and in return, l pray

441
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,520
for God to forgive their sins.

442
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,110
Run. Try to catch it.

443
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,754
Catch it.

444
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,150
Jump and you'll get it.
Go on, jump.

445
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,636
You won't make it.

446
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,671
You can't do it.

447
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,833
Even if you jump higher
than a horse, you won't make it.

448
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,433
Jump.

449
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,997
Who wants an apple?

450
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,950
Wait a minute. l'm coming.

451
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,158
lf you want an apple, follow me!

452
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,634
- Hello.
- Hello, madam.

453
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,871
Do you have a saw?

454
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,396
l wanted to thank you
for bringing the kids back.

455
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,471
That's all right.

456
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,756
lt was my duty.
Do you have a saw?

457
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,797
- What kind?
- A hacksaw.

458
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,792
No, l have a wood saw.

459
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,553
Thanks anyway.

460
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,715
Hello, do you have a saw?

461
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,632
No.

462
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,759
Why are those children
back with their parents?

463
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,752
lt'll sort itself out.

464
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,195
Do you have a saw?

465
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,638
We go to the trouble
of getting them out and they come back.

466
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,472
No, l don't have a saw.

467
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,472
Thanks anyway.

468
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,400
Hello, madam.
Do you have a saw?

469
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,438
- Yes, what kind?
- A hacksaw.

470
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,477
Yes, l'll get it for you.

471
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,349
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

472
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,878
What's up with those kids?
You take them, you bring them back...

473
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:56,148
Either keep them
or leave them to their parents!

474
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,834
lt'll be OK, madam.

475
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,718
Right. Thank you.

476
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,437
- Where are you?
- l'm here.

477
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,079
Come here a minute.

478
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:17,711
What is it?

479
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,758
Look, l have to go.

480
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,113
l have other children to see.
l'll give you this saw.

481
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:25,951
OK.

482
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,834
You may need to get out.

483
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,435
lt's locked, so here's the saw.

484
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,912
Either you saw through the bars
or you break the lock.

485
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,913
Saw through the bars?
But, madam...!

486
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,356
You have to do it yourself.

487
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,875
There'll be someone
from Welfare along to see you.

488
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,192
lf the door isn't open,
they'll take the children.

489
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,432
Do l really have to?

490
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,315
Yes.

491
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,235
l'm going.

492
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,958
lf you don't saw the bars,
we'll take your children away.

493
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,273
You bastard, don't saw those bars!
You'll destroy the place.

494
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,358
Madam, stop him!

495
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,876
You work for the authorities.

496
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,190
Don't let him do it.

497
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,513
Don't cut through them, husband.

498
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,874
All right, l'll let the children
play in the yard.

499
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,316
Don't, you son-of-a-bitch!

500
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,031
l won't lock the door anymore.

501
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,157
Don't saw them.

502
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:32,116
l'll only lock the door at night.
Don't saw through them.

503
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,959
Stop it! Stop it!

504
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,636
Sir, l want some apples.

505
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,111
You want some apples?
They're 200 tomans a kilo.

506
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,397
- Got any money?
- We don't have any money.

507
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,796
- You don't have any?
- No.

508
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,318
You have no money
and you want to buy apples?

509
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,391
Go ask your father for money.

510
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,590
Don't touch, kid. Go on.

511
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,919
Put them away.

512
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,472
Don't touch. Hands off!

513
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,315
Off you go.

514
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,313
Go ask their father for money.
lt's 200 tomans a kilo.

515
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,596
l told you not to touch.

516
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,835
200 tomans?
l'll ask their father for the money.

517
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:28,634
Don't cut through it.
You'll damage the lock.

518
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:35,715
lf you cut through it, we won't
be able to lock the door at night.

519
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,268
Don't cut it, you bastard.

520
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,315
Mon... Money.

521
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,790
They want some apples.

522
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,035
Zahra, Massoumeh, where were you?
l was worried.

523
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,150
Sir, give them some money.

524
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,790
They want some apples.
They take everything they see

525
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,911
from other kids.

526
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,439
Boy, l'm not so much of a miser

527
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,069
that l don't give them money.

528
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,595
One day, l gave them 1 toman each.

529
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,196
That evening,
Massoumeh couldn't eat anything.

530
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,718
She'd swallowed the coin.
She spent 24 hours in the hospital.

531
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,111
lt cost me a fortune
to get that 1 toman out.

532
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,230
Give her a bill,
she won't swallow that.

533
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,236
Here's 300 tomans.

534
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,396
l'm giving you 300 tomans.

535
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,357
100 for Massoumeh.

536
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:57,196
There's 100 tomans left for Zahra,

537
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,309
and 100 tomans for you.

538
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,711
l'm a prisoner here.
Keep an eye on them.

539
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,599
l'll take 100 tomans.

540
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,671
And l'll give you 200 tomans.

541
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,150
The social worker
wants them to do

542
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,153
the shopping themselves.

543
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,756
She's the cause of all our problems!

544
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,199
l'm off now, girls.
You go buy some apples.

545
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,955
No, that's not fair. lt's my turn!

546
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,831
Keep out of the way.

547
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,149
Move away.

548
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,039
Get away!

549
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,397
Let the poor things play too!

550
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,915
Sara, l think they're boys.

551
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,869
l think this one's a boy,
and the other's a girl.

552
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,031
Are you a boy or a girl?

553
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,675
Gi...

554
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,715
What?

555
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,752
You play with me, and you with her.

556
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,433
How's that?

557
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,317
Come here.

558
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,755
Come on.

559
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,833
Jump on the second square.

560
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,710
Not like that.

561
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,394
Like this.

562
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,910
lt's my turn.

563
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,716
Good.

564
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,916
Look, when you jump,

565
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:16,199
keep your legs apart.

566
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,950
Then, like this, and like this.

567
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,677
What's your name?

568
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,117
- What?
- Mass...

569
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,554
What?

570
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,079
You hitting me?

571
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,118
Sara, l don't want
to play with them anymore.

572
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,596
Sorry.

573
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,718
l forgive you.

574
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,236
OK, let's play.

575
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,430
Look how l do it.

576
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,190
How old are you?

577
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,871
Sara, let's not play with them.

578
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:10,670
Sara,

579
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,315
let's not play with them.

580
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,754
No, l don't want to.

581
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,080
You hit me,
then you give me an apple?

582
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,357
l wanted to teach you
how to play.

583
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,955
Eat it.

584
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,153
Thanks.

585
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,877
Thanks very much.

586
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,795
Girls!

587
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,554
Let's have a race

588
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,792
to see who can eat her apple first.

589
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,758
One, two, three!

590
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,119
Hurry up, you're last.

591
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,916
Massoumeh, hurry up.

592
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:17,872
l'm eating it slowly.
That way, l can savor it.

593
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:22,831
You're going to lose
if you eat it slowly.

594
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,796
Eat it quicker or you'll lose!

595
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,712
l'm going to win.

596
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,232
How do you know?

597
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:58,993
Don't be scared.

598
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,753
Massoumeh!

599
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,198
Come on the swings.

600
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,633
Do you want a watch?

601
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,110
Come on, let's go buy one.

602
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:04,798
We know a street seller
who has nice watches.

603
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,235
Do you want one

604
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,797
like my father's?

605
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,508
lt rings every Saturday morning,

606
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,558
every Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,

607
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,394
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

608
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,553
My father turns the alarm off
on a Friday so he can sleep.

609
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,155
Don't buy one like that,

610
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,153
because it rings
very early in the morning.

611
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:33,710
My friend, Roghieh,
always get full marks in dictation.

612
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,748
Once, l complained to the teacher

613
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,549
but she told me to be quiet.

614
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,030
My mother has a watch.

615
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,272
When she goes embroidering

616
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,830
at Mrs Pari's house,

617
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:55,232
she wears her watch.

618
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:00,156
lf l had enough money,
l'd buy the same one. lt's so pretty.

619
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,315
You buy the same one, OK?

620
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,154
lt's really pretty.

621
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,675
My watch is pretty, too.

622
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,673
Buy the same one.
The big hand's always on 4.

623
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,390
Sara's is no good.
The big hand's always on 8.

624
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,108
Don't buy that one.

625
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:22,351
So, which one do you want to buy?

626
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:26,550
One like that
or one like my mother's?

627
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:31,920
lt's so pretty!
You'd love it if you saw it.

628
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,555
lf l had enough money, l'd buy it.

629
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,833
The gate's open. Come in.

630
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:40,956
Hello.

631
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,874
May l?

632
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,269
Come in.

633
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,355
- Are you well?
- Fine. And you?

634
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,433
How are the girls?
Did you see their photo?

635
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,318
No.

636
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,834
Look.

637
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:09,833
Proceedings brought
against the father of the twins

638
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:15,117
Oh, woe is me!

639
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,790
We wanted to help you,
to save the children.

640
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:24,153
For the past 65 years,
nobody knew who l was,

641
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,719
nor where l lived.

642
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,879
The newspapers exaggerated.
They shouldn't have...

643
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:34,433
They dishonored me.

644
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,228
We're sorry for you.

645
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,313
We think of your children
like our children.

646
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:47,228
''How hard it is to put back together
the pieces of a broken mirror!''

647
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,353
lf only their mother wasn't blind...

648
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,752
l have to look after my daughters.
What else could l do?

649
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,672
We only wanted to help.

650
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,118
We wrote to Welfare
so they'd help your children.

651
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,396
You can see how they've changed.

652
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,473
They couldn't speak
or communicate before.

653
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,069
Now, they play with other children.

654
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,072
They say hello, and so on.

655
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,112
They buy ice cream.

656
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,670
Before, they didn't even know
what real food was!

657
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,279
lnstead of eating an ice cream,
they'd just throw it

658
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,073
in the gutter.

659
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,435
But l'm dishonored.

660
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,075
My family's in the paper.

661
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,515
Your daughters were unhappy.

662
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,512
l'm trying to cut through...

663
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:37,151
People say l chained my children up,
but it's not true.

664
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,517
Look, l'm sawing
through the bars of this door.

665
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,033
There's a street seller
who has nice watches.

666
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,677
There's one that sounds
like a train: ''Choo choo...''

667
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,480
Buy that one.

668
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,156
Massoumeh, buy that one!

669
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,630
They're really cheap.

670
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,713
You won't believe how cheap they are!

671
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,997
All right? You buy that one.

672
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:07,233
lt's just so cute.

673
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,710
- Will you buy it?
- Yes.

674
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,870
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, miss.

675
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,909
l want a watch
that goes ''Choo choo''.

676
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,159
l don't have any like that.

677
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,836
The other day, you had
a watch that went ''Choo choo''.

678
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:36,312
Just as you came,
a train went past, going ''Choo choo''

679
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:40,388
and you must have thought
it was the watch.

680
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,272
Massoumeh,
which one do you want then?

681
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,715
This one.

682
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,036
This one?

683
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,914
Come back with your father then.

684
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:06,710
OK.

685
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,474
We'll come back with your father.

686
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,670
- Hello.
- Hello, children.

687
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,394
They saw our watches
and they want one too.

688
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,553
We went to the watch seller,
and they chose one.

689
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,473
The man said
to come back with their father.

690
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,553
ls he their father
or their grandfather?

691
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,199
He's their father.

692
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:56,035
Sir, they want a watch.
You must buy them one.

693
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:00,319
Their father can't get out
until he saws through the bars.

694
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,472
For now, he's staying where he is.

695
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,797
Mrs Mohamadi,

696
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,749
please open this door.

697
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,919
l'm tired.
l'll finish it this evening.

698
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:28,439
l told you already: you must
saw through the bars to get out.

699
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:29,954
l won't open the door.

700
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,670
l'm tired, l can't go on now.
l'll do it this evening.

701
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,310
No, you must do it now.

702
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:40,592
l told you, l'll do it this evening.

703
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,111
l locked the door.
l won't go back on my decision.

704
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:48,717
l'll give them the key. lf they can
open the door, you can get out.

705
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,350
Let's see if Zahra can do it.

706
