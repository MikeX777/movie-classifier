1
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,348
My name is Subramaniyam.
I always wanted to be on top in life...

2
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,413
...but didn't think
I will be on top like this.

3
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,622
If I fall from here,
everything is finished.

4
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,094
No One can even identify my body.
- Help!

5
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,258
If a lion or tiger kills you
it atleast makes for a grand story.

6
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,603
Maybe I am the only person
to die in the hands of a goat.

7
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,707
My weight is 70 kilograms.

8
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,276
If my hands take the entire weight,
I might manage for 30 minutes.

9
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,844
Ifl alternate both hands
then maximum one hour.

10
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,846
It doesn't look like this goat will
let me live even for one hour.

11
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:56,619
What is this?
How did I get here? Who am I?

12
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,304
My father is a bank employee.

13
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,540
Though he counted lakhs
of rupees in the bank daily...

14
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,302
...we would fall shod
of money at home.

15
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:17,409
He told me that happiness is being satisfied with
what we have, and everyone can't become Ambani.

16
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,645
That logic just didn't get into my head.

17
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,424
The World recognises you
only by your bank balance.

18
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,923
I was ready to do anything
for that recognition.

19
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,431
I felt school was a waste of time.
I wasn't earning.

20
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,588
I felt the sooner
I got out of it the better.

21
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:39,059
I reached 10th standard when
my children my age were in 8th standard.

22
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,432
Soon all teachers and
parents became my fans.

23
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,598
I wake up at 4am daily
and take bath with cold water.

24
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,072
It is very good for my concentration.

25
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,507
Actually I follow everything
according to time table.

26
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,579
Chocolates and
ice-creams are banned.

27
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,013
Ifl really feel like it then maybe
on some national holiday...

28
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,552
...or Sunday, I will eat one.
- He is acting too smart

29
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,025
- Catch him!
- Stop!

30
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:02,683
Stop!

31
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,350
- Please leave me!
- Where will you go?

32
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,291
Tell me your rules again..
It's wrong to eat ice-creams, is it?

33
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,431
Ice-creams are very good,
I will get you the best ice-creams.

34
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,760
So why were you acting smafl
in front of my parents yesterday?

35
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,596
Hey! Umbrella.

36
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,366
Hey! Stop...

37
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,978
That's when I saw him for the first time.

38
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,705
I didn't know then, how drastically
my life was going to change.

39
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,113
- Who are you?
- Rishi! Class 10 B.

40
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,584
This is 10 A's matter.
Don't interfere.

41
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,586
Which section is not the point here...

42
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,588
Even you are acting smart aa...?

43
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,395
The point is who makes the first move!

44
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,392
Hey, Subbu! This is my house.

45
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,401
Keep it inside.

46
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,760
- Hi, mom!
- Hi, Rishi!

47
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,271
- That's my best friend Subbu!
- Oh! Hi, Subbu!

48
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,000
- Hi.
- Rishi's friend?

49
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,270
Which class you are studying in?
- 10:00 AM

50
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,280
Why are you eating the boost powder directly?

51
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,105
But, I like it like that only mom.

52
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,916
Rishi's father is a big businessman.

53
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,085
Rishi is a big disappointment for him.

54
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,519
You can never say how friends
like Rishi end up becoming your best friend.

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,422
They become a part of our life
as if they have been there forever.

56
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,258
So many first time experiences
because of him.

57
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:12,919
Stop!

58
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,156
Being chased after stealing for
the first time.

59
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,162
Stop I say!

60
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,860
Watched a movie from the best seats..
...for the first time.

61
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,436
I rode a bicycle for the first time.

62
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,772
I fell for the first time.

63
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,004
I almost drowned
for the first time.

64
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,542
Rishi would do whatever he felt like.

65
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,675
Life was a Bollywood movie to him.

66
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:35,775
"Popular Hindi film song"

67
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,443
Hey, get out!

68
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,680
Sit! Sit! Hey!0

69
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:42,122
Rishi would spend more
time outside class than inside...

70
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,123
...except in Telugu class...
Prabhakar sir.

71
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,959
Rishi liked Prabhakar sir very much.

72
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,355
<i>He told more stories</i> than <i>lessons.</i>

73
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,025
"The World is a illusion."

74
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,866
"Life is a illusion."

75
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:59,340
"This is the essence of the Vedas."

76
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,807
What great poetry...what a poet!

77
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:04,640
This family,
jobs, societal responsibilities...

78
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,479
...they tie you up, blind you.
Take you away from the truth.

79
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:15,887
- Good morning, teacher.
- Good morning. Sit down.

80
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:19,656
Thank you, teacher.

81
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,224
Who are you?
Where is Prabhakar sir?

82
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,868
First sit down!
I am your new Telugu teacher.

83
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,935
Prabhakar sir has quit his job.

84
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:28,732
No!

85
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,508
Subbu! Subbu!

86
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,244
Why did you come at this time?
my timetable...

87
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,047
Happy birthday, Subbu!

88
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,189
How do you know?

89
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,451
How wont I know..
Come I have a surprise for you.

90
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,859
- Open your eyes and see.
- No, thank you.

91
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,698
- Hey! Where?
- Come, follow me.

92
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,795
On a birthday you take someone out
for a movie or a hotel but...

93
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,202
...why did you bring me to
a graveyard man!

94
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,534
Come. I said its a surprise.

95
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,701
This is enough surprise man.
Come, lets go back.

96
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,114
- Hey, no!
- They are Aghora sadhus.

97
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,048
- People say they eat human flesh.
- Why are you telling me this?

98
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,050
Yes...

99
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:17,480
Come.

100
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,257
Hello, sir.

101
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,825
- How did you find me?
- Your apartment watchman told me, sir.

102
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,327
Who is that? Subbu?

103
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,901
Yes, sir. Today is his birthday.

104
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,061
Hey, happy birthday.
Seek blessings from Guruji.

105
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:34,864
- Go.
- No, sir.

106
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:35,767
Seek blessings.

107
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:36,736
- It's o-k.

108
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,569
- Seek.
- No!

109
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:39,673
Go!

110
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,008
Seek.

111
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:48,083
Doesn't your guru have an ashram?

112
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:51,083
Why is he sitting in a cemetery like this?

113
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,087
Whether it is graveyard or temple...

114
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,887
...whether diamonds or stones, you or me
Everything is the same.

115
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,528
That is the first principle
of the Aghora way.

116
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,187
That sounds great sir, but.
when are you coming back to class?

117
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,527
That new teacher is super boring.

118
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,293
I have given up these worldly illusions.

119
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,699
I am going to
Doodh Kashi with Babaji.

120
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,665
- He wants to leave his body in that holy place.
- Where is that?

121
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:15,711
In the shadow ofthe tallest mountain in the Himalayas
there is said to be a secret lake.

122
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,644
Our scriptures mention it
as Akasha Ganga.

123
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,552
When will I see you again?
Can we also come there?

124
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,346
It must be written in your fate to visit
Doodh Kashi. Not everybody can find it.

125
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,454
WOW!

126
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,319
So now we HAVE to go there at any cost.
Ask your Guruji.

127
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,896
Is it written in my fate?
Will I go?

128
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,631
Will I take Subbu along with me?

129
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,300
Who must go where and with whom.

130
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,999
Only the Lord Shiva knows.

131
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,912
Himalayas! A Secret lake!!

132
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,013
We definitely need to go there.

133
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,049
First I need to go home.

134
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,484
My time table got
spoiled because of you.

135
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,214
- Now I should revise twice.
- Forget your timetable man..

136
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,758
Whatever happens,
we will definitely go to Doodh Kashi.

137
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,394
- Hey! Look in front!
- !!!

138
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,332
I thought you will learn
some good from Subbu...

139
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,102
...but you are spoiling him too.

140
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,404
- Uncle, actually...
- Subbu!

141
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,778
Where are you roaming in the night?

142
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,373
Where are you going?!

143
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,111
Doodh Kashi!

144
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,684
Sorry. I will make sure
this won't happen again.

145
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,528
Rishi's father became
very angry after the accident.

146
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,063
They shifted and left Hyderabad.

147
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,028
Since then I lost touch with Rishi.

148
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,871
Now there was no distraction.
My plan was back on track.

149
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,382
Is the measure of progress only money?

150
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,144
Should the Future of farmers
who live by the earth...

151
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,583
...be decided by those in these skyscrapers?

152
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,381
Ramaiah seeds company.

153
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,721
Since 50 years, their priority has
been the farmers welfare rather than profits...

154
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,294
...and are treating their
thousands of employees like family.

155
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,227
Company's MD Mr. Ramaiah.

156
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,560
On another hand
Pashupathi Industries...

157
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,999
...this company has
built many Hi-Tech Industries.

158
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,368
Now they have set their
eyes on Ramaiah Company's lands.

159
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,272
We have built this
company together...working hard.

160
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,742
We have invested our lives in it,
not just money.

161
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,074
We will not sell
our lives, whatever the price.

162
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,740
For buying my shares
in Ramaiah Company...

163
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,079
...this is the offer
letter given by Pashupathi.

164
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,350
This is my answer to him.

165
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:42,018
What is this?
Mani, what the hell is this!

166
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,457
I even offered 10 percent
premium on those shares.

167
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,026
- I didn't think he will do this.
- Enough.

168
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,098
I told you to make
this offer privately.

169
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,762
Now he came on TV and spoiled
my reputation.

170
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,100
Call the PR depaflment and
ask them to fix it immediately.

171
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,263
. OK@V'
. OK@V'

172
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,608
Where is Subbu?

173
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,880
Hey, Subbu. Are you watching TV?

174
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,350
Dad is very upset.

175
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,944
You know he tried many
times to buy Ramaiah Company.

176
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,290
Come fast, we need to do
some damage control.

177
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,051
- I'm here.

178
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:21,391
Subbu...

179
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:24,565
The Mistake is mine.

180
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,229
I bought so many companies
over these years.

181
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,297
Only this one has eluded me.

182
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,708
A jewel in my crown.

183
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,543
- I wished for it
- Sir, there is nothing wrong in wishing.

184
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,648
- Ramaiah Company is yours.
- Hey! Don't talk rubbish.

185
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,259
Ramaiah has been protecting
his company since 50 years.

186
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,157
He will not sell it at any cost.
I already tried it.

187
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,493
We saw what happened when you tried.

188
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,835
- Now, Its my turn.
- Pashupathi... Look, Pashupathi.

189
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,569
He is talking without
showing any respect to senior.

190
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,866
Subbu, this is not easy.

191
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,502
In spite of offering a blank cheque,
shareholders are not selling.

192
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,839
It's not money that they need to see...

193
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,848
...its their needs and liabilities.

194
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,048
Are you teaching me only?
You think he Will come looking for you?

195
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,382
- Sir! Sir! Stop, sir! Please, sir!
- Who is Subramaniyam here?

196
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,024
Can't you understand if I tell you once?

197
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,795
I tore it in front of the media.

198
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,795
And you send it again?
Fine! I will tear in front of you.

199
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,935
Tear it! Tear it!
I lose just 50 rupees if you tear it.

200
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,367
But you will receive
5 Million if you sign it.

201
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,803
Double the value of the shares you own.

202
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:40,136
- Is this a Bribe?
- No! No! Sir, I know about your honesty.

203
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,473
But can you send your son to America with
your honesty and a 30,000 rupees salary?

204
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,445
Can you perform your
elder daughter's marriage?

205
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,845
How do you know about these?

206
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,747
Anyway, that's not related.

207
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,047
We lived on Mr. Ramaiah's grace.

208
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,087
Whatever you may say,
we will not betray him.

209
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:57,819
This same dialoguemsounds familiar...
Oh Yes, Mr. Ranganath.

210
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,463
Before writing over
his 10 percent shares.

211
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,366
Mr. Bhaskar also..same dialogue

212
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,835
All of you speak alike.

213
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,734
- Mr. Bhaskar too"?
- Kiriti.

214
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,032
- Sir
- Tea.

215
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,140
Okay, sir.

216
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,567
Mr. Ramaiah's company <i>is</i>
incurring <i>losses</i> since four years.

217
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,872
Sales have reduced.
They are unable to pay salaries.

218
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:19,414
If it continues like this then
company will shut down in one year.

219
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,246
After that thousands of employees
will lose jobs. That is...

220
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,180
That is...real Betrayal.

221
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,222
Mr. Ramaiah will look into it.

222
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,755
H OW?

223
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,360
People like Mr. Ramaiah cannot do
business these days.

224
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,589
Business needs people like me.
Otherwise companies will shut down.

225
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,396
- You have it, right?
What?

226
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:39,763
Sugar. You have it.

227
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,769
See, I am thinking more
about you than yourself.

228
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,270
Look, Mr. Gopal Rao,
your 10 percent shares.

229
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,071
You must be thinking
that by keeping them safe...

230
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,543
...without betraying Mr. Ramaiah
is correct now...

231
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,548
...but after your company shuts downs in
six months...and your shares become worthless.

232
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,676
...after your son's studies and
your daughter's marriage get spoiled...

233
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,947
...you may not find
it correct at that time.

234
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,383
Presently, You have tea...

235
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:04,626
...peacefully.

236
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,865
And...Sign for your future.

237
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,407
For Mr. Gopal Rao--

238
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,253
By the way, I forgot.

239
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,548
For Mani also...He tried.

240
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:37,594
Hey, Mani!
I really don't believe this.

241
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,830
Subbu, how did you...when did you..

242
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,521
Sir, I know how important
Ramaiah's deal is to you.

243
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,166
I have been working
on it for few months.

244
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,428
- Oh, totally--
- 50 percent shares, sir.

245
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,704
Sir, we need 51 percent
to have our control.

246
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,499
I was thinking why
you didn't enter yet.

247
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,110
Believe me, sir. Ramaiah's nephew...
they have pampered him a lot...

248
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,904
...he is in deep debt...

249
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,775
...he committed the mistake which
we need. The shares in his name...

250
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,848
...l am going to buy them.
- Are you sure?

251
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,919
100 percent, sir. Those shares
will be in our name in two days.

252
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,919
Amazing! Amazing, Subbu.

253
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,984
What I couldn't do all these years... Mani,
call for a press meeting immediately

254
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,121
We will announce
Ramaiah Company belongs to us.

255
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,225
<i>QKZV -</i>

256
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,633
Sir, amazing how you convinced him
in the time it took me to make tea.

257
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,865
Sir, you are really superb... okay.

258
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:27,373
- By the way, my marriage is fixed
- With whom?

259
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,210
A family friend... she stays in my village..
I know her since childhood.

260
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,041
What do you want
to do in life, Kiriti?

261
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,743
Sir, I want to become like you.
You are my role model.

262
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,751
If I marry my villager relative now...

263
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,322
...then forget my position,
I will come to your position.

264
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,158
Excuse me, sir?

265
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,053
Kiriti, if you marry
your uncle's daughter...

266
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,595
...at best you will get pickles
on festivals from the village.

267
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,393
Yes, recently I received mango pickle.

268
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,761
- Is it good?

269
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:56,066
Yes, sir. Chilli was bit strong,
also I like garlic pickle more.

270
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,070
- Kiriti.

271
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,898
Jump..

272
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,235
- Hi, Subbu
- Hi, Riya. Come.

273
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,243
So Mr. Subramaniyam.

274
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,511
So Riya.

275
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,919
The company my father couldn't buy
since 20 years will belong to us now.

276
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,987
And that...is because of you.
You know I don't like anything easily?

277
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,923
I want the best in everything.

278
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,326
- Me too
- But I like you.

279
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,098
If your father likes me too...then...l'm ready.

280
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,682
Hi!

281
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,556
Hi! For Riya's marriage...

282
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,784
...l thought they will
choose a big business family.

283
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,623
Don't know how they agreed
for a guy having no background.

284
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,527
Did you see Mrs. Aggarwais necklace.
It is a imitation jewellery.

285
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,497
They had to sell everything
after the income tax raid.

286
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,636
No bad, they are still
maintaining the show well.

287
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,396
- Hello
- Hello, I love your necklace.

288
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,538
- Thank you, dear
- Congratulations.

289
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,471
Congratulations!
I was just telling my husband...

290
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,837
...how lucky Riya is.

291
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,705
What a perfect couple!

292
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,245
Hello everybody!

293
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,252
Thank you very much for coming today.
Thank you.

294
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,758
When I met Subbu for the first time,
I felt I had seen him somewhere.

295
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,325
And then I remembered...

296
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,264
...it was me.

297
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,194
Hunger is essential for business.

298
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,169
A Hunger that can consume this whole world.

299
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:41,366
It took 30 years for
me to reach this position.

300
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:46,513
But Subbu...
he is here in just five years.

301
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,611
To be precise and simple.

302
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,450
Subbu is the future.

303
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,755
And I think my daughter has made
the smartest decision in her life.

304
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,930
Riya my darling, come.

305
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,935
I love you very much today.
You know why?

306
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:13,198
Somewhere I always missed having a son.
Today that wish is fulfilled.

307
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,472
Welcome to the family my boy.
Subbu... here.

308
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,776
I got something for you.

309
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:35,429
For now key is here, within ten days you
will receive a car designed personally.

310
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,591
Thank you so much, sir.

311
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,167
Praveen!

312
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,971
"Who is Subramaniyam!"

313
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:56,082
"Who is Subramaniyam!"

314
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,582
"Who is Subramaniyam!"

315
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,726
Riya, did you invite him?

316
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,993
- No, dad.
- Then who the hell is he!

317
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,364
Subbu!

318
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,107
Idiot, How can you not call ME
to your engagement?

319
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,540
Anyway, how can you escape me...

320
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,176
Rishi..This is not your type of pafly.
Leave, We will talk later.

321
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:28,784
Hey, is this...my sister-in-law.
You won the jackpot! She is hot!

322
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,979
I mean..beautiful.
There is still time for marriage.

323
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,316
Just remember,
if you have any doubt on Subbu.

324
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:39,326
...l am single.
- This is my friend Rishi.

325
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,988
Friend aa? Best friend!

326
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,495
We are best friends!

327
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:48,035
Hey, uncle... father in law?...
we are best friends.

328
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,470
- Aunty! Greetings!
- Hey! Hey!

329
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,634
I don't... I don't like this.
Get him out of here.

330
00:18:55,901 --> 00:19:00,646
Hey, You haven't see Subbu
dancing to this song, right?

331
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,219
Hey, Subbu! Let's show them.
Ready! One! Two! Three! Go!

332
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,714
Well, now you are pan of our gang,
right?

333
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,155
- Come..
- Subbu.

334
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,709
- Hi, Subbu!
- Hi!

335
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:37,615
Today is the appointment
at Casa Paradise.

336
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:41,183
We can't be late, Subbu. We have
to wait for another month if we miss this.

337
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,348
I am starting right now.

338
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,926
Come fast, Subbu.

339
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,925
- Hello?
What is the sound?

340
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,368
Riya, I'll just call you back.

341
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:55,703
Yellamma!

342
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,068
Yellamma! Back straight, Yellamma.

343
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,143
- Do this for ten minutes.
- Like this! Like this!

344
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,543
From the navel.

345
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,559
Hey, what is this?

346
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,718
Subbu, finally woke up!
Come and join us.

347
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:23,093
Yellamma, why did you stop?
What did Baba say? Daily 10 minutes.

348
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,731
Yellamma, enough of doing yoga.
Go do some cooking.

349
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,567
- This sir is not letting me go
- Hey, let her stay.

350
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,471
Yellamma, holiday for you today.
I will cook food for sir.

351
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,344
Tell me what you will eat.
Baked beans, pan cakes, hash-browns...

352
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,779
- Omelette
- You know how to cook?

353
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,252
Know how...? Do you know from how far people
would come to eat my cooking in Goa?

354
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,788
When did you go to Goa?

355
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,948
After Hampi.
I worked there as tourist guide.

356
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:50,923
I had sent you postcard.

357
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,255
- Didn't you get it?
- ok..so now what?

358
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,691
Glad you asked.

359
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,354
Let me show you.

360
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,760
Hey.

361
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,863
- Where?
It is a surprise.

362
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,536
Dada!

363
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:09,271
- This is still alive?
Dada is forever man.

364
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,446
Isn't it, Dada?

365
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,976
Come, let's go for a ride.

366
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,351
No thank you.
I still remember last time's fracture.

367
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:19,011
Dude, I went for the
first ride with you on it.

368
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,055
I want to go for the
last ride also with you.

369
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,284
What last ride?! I'm not coming.

370
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,722
Hey! Stop!

371
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,956
Do you know where all Dada's taken me?

372
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,794
He took me to places where
professional bikers wouldn't go.

373
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,127
I will miss him.

374
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:34,970
Why miss?

375
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,167
- I am selling him
- Selling it?

376
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,672
Who will buy it?

377
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,475
I need money for Doodh Kashi.
So I am selling it.

378
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,309
- What is Doodh Kashi?
What is Doodh Kashi?

379
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,783
Hey, Babaji, childhood, graveyard...
did you forget it?

380
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,980
Didn't you forget it?
So what? Will you go there now?

381
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,621
I am going. You too are coming.

382
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:59,752
It is very cold there. Let us pack
sweaters, monkey caps and go, Subbu.

383
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:03,161
Stop it man..Won't you settle down in life anyiime?
Will you roam around like this forever?

384
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,031
Hey, say anything you want...l heard about
Doodh Kashi for the first time with you.

385
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,173
I planned to go with you,
this is final. It is a magical place.

386
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,674
How can you believe some rubbish
told by someone in graveyard?

387
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,904
Subbu, Baba said that one
should be destined to go there, right?

388
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,743
Do you know what my grandfather said?
*old folk tale*

389
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,685
- If that is true and this is also true.
- But this is truly true.

390
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,514
Doodh Kashi is calling us.

391
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,555
When I was roaming aimlessly,
I met a man who climbed Everest.

392
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,852
He had a guide named Pemba.
He told him a story.

393
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,188
It's the same story of Doodh Kashi..How can that
story and the story we heard in childhood match?

394
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,855
I have his contact. I called him
up and have set everyihing. It means...

395
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,627
...it is calling you and me.
- When did it call me?

396
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,861
Why do you involve me?
If it called you then you go.

397
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,598
- Yes, Riya?
Why did you cut the phone?

398
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:48,040
- I was just half asleep--
- Come fast, Subbu.

399
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,043
- Hello?
Already on the way... heavy traffic.

400
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,274
Nobody is following the signal..
I will reach in five minutes. Bye.

401
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,482
Sister-in-law? Date? Where?

402
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,212
- Casa Paradise
- What is it? Hotel?

403
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,551
House. We are buying.
It is a gated community.

404
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,386
We cannot go there without invitation.

405
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,293
Nobody will invite me.

406
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:09,293
I too want to see the propefly which we
cannot see unless he invites me. Can I come?

407
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:16,137
<i>'</i> Yes!
<i>'</i> Hey! Sit!

408
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,237
- Rishi, so what do you do?
- Anything.

409
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,879
Anything means? Don't you have job?

410
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,140
Of course I do.
A full time job.

411
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:30,084
Every day, 365 days,
I don't get even a single holiday.

412
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,289
- Oh! What is it?
- Life.

413
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,687
What is a more
impoflant job than that? Tell me.

414
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,956
You tell everyone these stories
and escape very well from life.

415
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,797
I am making sure that life
doesn't escape from me.

416
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:47,025
What will you say if someone asks,
when did you enjoy yourself last?

417
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,262
You'll say, "I enjoyed myself
at Ramesh's marriage..."

418
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,706
or, "..we had a good time when we
went to noflh India with my family."

419
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:57,938
I don't want a life where I can
count my happy moments on my fingers.

420
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:01,606
I want to live life. Fully,
every second.

421
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,547
- What about money?
What about money??

422
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,347
There are 100 ways to earn enough to live.

423
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,888
Hello. Welcome Casa Paradise.

424
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,497
I am Naina, your hostess.

425
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,031
- Hello, Naina
- Today I will be showing the property...

426
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,793
...and before entering
into the property...

427
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,062
...please wear your shoe covers.
- Sure.

428
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:25,469
Can we enter by removing our shoes?
Waste of plastic, right?

429
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,805
Sorry. No barefoot. Management rule.

430
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:33,075
You should have said it before.
We would have come with our own covers.

431
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,148
I'm right na?

432
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,542
- Come
- Please.

433
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,855
This villa has a private swimming pool
with automatic temperature control.

434
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:44,050
And it also has a special
water cleaning system...

435
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,160
Very sad.

436
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,318
What happened to it?

437
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,056
This is an imported
ikebana tree from Japan.

438
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:52,225
Japan? It doesn't look imported,
it looks ill.

439
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,860
Please come in.

440
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,405
Shame on this society, for not letting
a tree also live like a tree.

441
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,908
Also we have a 24 hours
concierge service...

442
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,246
...and the entire marble floor
is directly imported from Italy.

443
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,520
All these wall furnishing
designs are from England.

444
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,784
This furniture is from Paris.
State of the art security is from Germany.

445
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,628
What does state ofthe an mean?

446
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,860
- This?
Hey, come.

447
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:27,666
These designer chandeliers too
are ordered specially from Belgium.

448
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,364
So except the people, there is nothing
related to India in this house, right?

449
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,240
Yes, sir.
You'll feel like you're living abroad.

450
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,640
- Very good
- And toilets, fittings...

451
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,803
meveryihing is from Italy.

452
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,543
- And designer toilet papers too are from...
- Hey, this is bit too much.

453
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,881
Designer toilet papers?
Are they going to save them after using?

454
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,291
Sir, you may not be
aware of these comforts...

455
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,893
...but nowadays people
are expecting all this.

456
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,290
My phone. Excuse me.

457
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:58,058
Hello? How is the pickle
that I sent you recently?

458
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,832
Are you eating it or not?

459
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,573
Our neighbours saw your picture and
think you've lost lots of weight...

460
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,768
- Please! Give the phone. Please, sir
- They are all.

461
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,574
- Tell him, sir. Please
- What?

462
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,580
- My phone!
- Hello?

463
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,186
Mother, I will talk later. Bye.

464
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,184
Yes, sister?

465
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:24,190
This is our real background, right?

466
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,124
What is this Naina?
It doesn't seem to match.

467
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,093
Naivedyala Nagamani. Naina in shod.

468
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,826
Nagamani? What a nice name!

469
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,766
Why do we need Naina and all?

470
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,766
Shall we continue?

471
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,306
- What about this slum over there?
- That's not a big problem, madam.

472
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,471
That slum, huts and people
will be cleared after sometime.

473
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,616
We talked to the commissioner already.

474
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,412
- So where will they go?
- Who knows?

475
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,681
- They are used to this
- Yes.

476
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,215
The Poor man's end is
a rich man's beginning.

477
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:56,625
- Sir
- Do you like the propefly, madam?

478
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,022
- Sure. I like it.
- What?!

479
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:01,225
No, sir.

480
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,262
But sir, I--

481
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:05,893
But--

482
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:09,799
lam coming, sir.

483
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,540
- What happened?
- He is not taking the call, sir.

484
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,474
- I confirmed with him two days back--
- Subbu!

485
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,546
This project was your responsibility.

486
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,552
I trusted you even though
everyone warned me.

487
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,255
I gave you a free hand
and let you spend as much money as you wanted.

488
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,259
I even gave you my daughter's hand
thinking you are the future.

489
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,725
Forget about the money.

490
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,928
My company's reputation.

491
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,733
My name... you spoiled everything.

492
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:45,507
Sir, I already took his bank
account details..it was planned...

493
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,335
- In the meantime--
- Subbu!

494
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,001
You underestimated Ramaiah.

495
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,675
He bought those shares before you.

496
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,688
No problem... no problem...
everyone makes mistakes.

497
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,462
I will start afresh thinking
I made mistake in your matter.

498
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,132
Sir, I will talk to Ramaiah.
I can fix this.

499
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:12,895
<i>And...“ you doth...</i>

500
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,865
...not just your career...

501
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:19,598
meveryihing will be finished.

502
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:22,971
Sir--

503
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:32,819
Riya... Riya! Riya!

504
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,616
Sir, an emergency.
My aunt is unwell.

505
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:36,585
Kiriti!

506
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,596
Excuse me.
I want to meet Ramaiah.

507
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,100
Not Ramaiah.

508
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,236
Ask for Ramaiah Sir.

509
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,805
Oh, okay. I want to meet Ramaiah Sir.

510
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:51,936
Come.

511
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,310
- Sir, someone came to meet you
- Hello, sir.

512
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:05,511
My name is Subramaniyam.

513
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,090
You must have heard of me.

514
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:12,088
I didn't think you will be so simple.
In fact had we met and talked before...

515
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,923
...we would have saved a lot of time.

516
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,525
So here's my plan.
A plan that you cannot refuse.

517
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,657
All Plans are those of God.

518
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,660
Not ours.

519
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,472
Sir, your company has not
made profits since four years.

520
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,275
You NEED this more than I do.

521
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,538
My grandfather used to say...

522
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:35,447
...nature gives what we need...

523
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,310
...not what we THINK we need.

524
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,783
So you can understand better,
Let me tell you in English.

525
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:45,783
Nature gives us enough for our need,
not for our greed.

526
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,561
We are always dissatisfied.

527
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,799
If we have one car,
we want another one.

528
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,992
If we have one cell phone,
we want another one.

529
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,638
We wish to earn more
money than what we have.

530
00:29:55,794 --> 00:30:00,641
Well said, sir.
Needs increase as we progress.

531
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,040
That's why we invented a bullock can
so we could go faster than walk.

532
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:04,646
It was not enough,
so we invented cars.

533
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,306
After we invented planes and so on...

534
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:11,080
But remember, Whatever you board,
we should land on our earih.

535
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,188
We need to walk on our own feet.

536
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,089
Sir, well said.
Yours is a seeds company.

537
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:20,661
Sir, what if a seed says I'm not greedy
and I don't want to grow.

538
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,697
They are not growing for themselves.

539
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,425
They are growing for us.

540
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:31,670
Grow for others...
...and not yourself.

541
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,335
Sir, I cannot make you understand.

542
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,507
That's because You don't understand yet.

543
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,282
Sir, we have dispatched
the entire seeds.

544
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,113
Okay, sir.
lam coming to the point directly.

545
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,980
I will give whatever price you want.

546
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:48,146
You can continue
as long as you want as MD.

547
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:51,260
I will convince them saying that the name
of your company also remains Ramaiah.

548
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,952
It will change only on papers.

549
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,391
- Greetings, sir
- Greetings, sir.

550
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,225
- Greetings, sir
- Greetings.

551
00:30:56,588 --> 00:31:00,001
Sir, anyway, is it necessary for you to take tension
of business and employees at this age?

552
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:03,002
Your Children are already settled. You will get
lot of money if you sell the company.

553
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,971
You can wake up every morning
and read your newspaper peacefully...

554
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,768
...and play with grandchildren
in the evening...

555
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:11,379
...and sit on verandah at night and
talk to friends and spend life happily.

556
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,481
Will you do this job
ifl give you all the money you want?

557
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,879
Sir, why will I do a job
if I have all the money I want?

558
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,419
<i>LWill!</i>

559
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,217
Even if I have all the money in the world,
I will still do this work.

560
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,721
I am not working for
the money I am getting.

561
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,726
I make Money for the work
I am doing.

562
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,228
Sir, it is not that...

563
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,500
Now let me come to the point. Listen!

564
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,729
Thousands of people trust me
and work for me.

565
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,731
Millions of people are farming peacefully
because of the work I do.

566
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:43,011
Whatever you may say,
This company is not for sale.

567
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,746
Subbu! Subbu! Subbu! Good news!

568
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:56,292
- You will be shocked if you hear it.
- What is it?

569
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,427
Tomorrow...we are leaving to Doodh Kashi.

570
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,323
Okay, if not tomorrow
then day after tomorrow.

571
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:04,126
I am going mad. Cannot you think of
anything else other than Doodh Kashi?

572
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,534
My Entire life is falling apart

573
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,528
All these years work,
my planning, everything ruined.

574
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:10,832
Riya also is not taking my calls.

575
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,200
This close... I came this close to
becoming a partner in the company.

576
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:16,811
Everything is--

577
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:20,815
Did you lose the job?

578
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:27,117
Means from tomorrow you are free,
then we can go to Doodh Kashi.

579
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,620
Okay, cheer up.

580
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:35,120
You are Subbu! You won't lose.
Don't give up. I will help you. Come.

581
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,961
- This is--
- All this is waste.

582
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,228
- They are 50, 100... petty shares.
- Are they waste?

583
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,238
Rangarao, 35 shares... waste.

584
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:58,352
Sunita, age 53... really waste.

585
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,821
Krishnamuflhy,
100 class A shares, waste.

586
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,861
Sorry, A class waste.

587
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,256
What did you say now?

588
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:14,268
- I said we will go to Doodh Kashi.
- Not that-- Just now.

589
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,763
Krishnamuflhy, 100 class A shares.

590
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,535
Class A shares mean
one multiplied by thousand.

591
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,080
Total one lakh shares. Give it!

592
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:29,848
Oh! I will give if you say you
will come to Doodh Kashi.

593
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,615
Hey, if they are really Class A
shares then I will come anywhere.

594
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,186
- Rishi...
- Subbu??

595
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,694
I've only thought of you as a friend...

596
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,764
- Subbu!
- Ouch!

597
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,243
Krishnamuflhy... here's the address.
Let us go, come.

598
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,641
If we go now,
They will think we are thieves

599
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,882
Shall we go tomorrow morning?
I will give you a party.

600
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,651
- Let us go to Taj
- Not Taj, I will take you somewhere. Come.

601
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:13,423
Doodh Kashi... at least closer to it.

602
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,432
This is very strong. Great kick!

603
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,236
- This is only a quarter..
- the booze?

604
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,243
Both the booze and our life.

605
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,574
- Talk some interesting topic
- Interesting?

606
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,911
- Tell me about Riya
- Riya? ok.

607
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,413
Riya was born in Banjara Hills,
studied fashion in America...

608
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,452
...walked the ramp in Paris...

609
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,749
...the only heiress to
Pashupathi Industries... she is perfect.

610
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,081
That's it. Perfect.

611
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,693
I asked for a love story man,
not bio-data.

612
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,696
- Is there love? Love?
Love?

613
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,667
Love means Riya... Riya means life.

614
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:57,432
- Life is a ladder...how you climb this ladder of life, is life!
- Hey, stop it.

615
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,837
How can there be no love!?

616
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:00,942
- You will get married, right?
Yes.

617
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,510
And then your first night.

618
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,203
Do you think your first night is
a board meeting...

619
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,370
...so that it will start
if you say, let us start?

620
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:09,609
How can I tell you...0k
think this is you.

621
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,881
This is Riya...
if you both meet... where--

622
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,556
Hey! She is drinking you man!

623
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:20,695
- Who?

624
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,627
- Who she?
- She! She!

625
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,728
I have only one bottle...

626
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,801
...how can she drink.
- Thief!

627
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:28,135
She took it.

628
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,132
My bottle! ls this fair? Tell me.

629
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,742
Happy binhday to me!!

630
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:39,975
First time... I am drinking
alcohol for the first time.

631
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:44,319
I never drank even
a soda till now.

632
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,753
Iam not drinking
because it is birthday.

633
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:50,754
I'm drinking because
Nobody knows it is birthday!

634
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:54,322
I don't have friends
who pester me for a party.

635
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,897
I don't have a family
to scold me ifl go home late.

636
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:01,527
My life is like this only...
I going to stay alone...forever.

637
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,018
Hey! What are you doing?

638
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:22,620
- Just checking what's behind that hair
- Just because you find girl alone...

639
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,555
...you acting smafl?

640
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:28,060
Hello, I am already engaged.
Her name is Riya.

641
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,199
Riya is my future. Riya is my life.

642
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:33,358
- Life is a ladder..and how you climb that ladder--
- Hey, hey stop man...

643
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,264
Hi!

644
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,238
- I am Rishi
- I am Subbu.

645
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:39,374
- So what?

646
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,373
So friends?

647
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,311
We should know each other to
become friends, right?

648
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,949
We should become
friends to know each other, right?

649
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,744
These are just empty words.

650
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:57,723
I know.
You will leave me after two days.

651
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,955
Never... once I give you my
hand then life time guarantee.

652
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,995
Hey, now only two of us are here.

653
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:09,661
You too join. We will become three.
The Three musketeers.

654
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,569
And we will be together always,
we will be happy all the time.

655
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,073
Friends forever!

656
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,781
- Promise?
- Promise?

657
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,441
- My name is Nandi
- Nandi.

658
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:26,077
Nandi, Subbu and
I have to go to Doodh Kashi.

659
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,416
What are you whispering in her ears?

660
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:31,017
They say what we tell in Nandi's ears,
will come true.

661
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:34,425
- Tell my matter too.
- Done! Done!

662
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:37,097
- What is Doodh Kashi?
- Doodh Kashi!

663
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:43,098
A magical place near the
tallest mountain in the Himalayas.

664
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,601
Since childhood it's been
my dream to go there.

665
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:53,477
If only I could do one thing
in life, then I wish to go there.

666
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:57,717
Hey, if we go there then
you will know who you are...

667
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:58,819
...and I will know who I am.

668
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,751
You go find out if you want.
I know who I am, very well.

669
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,550
So tell me who you are.

670
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:09,022
- Subramaniyam
- Not your name. Who are you?

- What is Doodh Kashi?

00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:14,642
If you want to know who you are,

681
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,647

that since a long time, sir.

684
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:25,155
- Who is Subramaniyam?
- You shut up.

685
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:26,926
Hey, tell me who you are.

686
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,256
- Look, Sai Kumar!
- I am not Sai Kumar.

687
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:31,229
Sai Kumar or Rajashekar...

688
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:33,535
...when we both were drinking,
this girl came and took my bottle...

689
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,102
Girl? What girl?

690
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,169
Over there.

691
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,577
- Where?
- Where?

692
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,776
- She went that way.
- Come!

693
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,784
Hey! Hey!

694
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,220
Subbu, Let's leave
for Doodh Kashi tomorrow?

695
00:41:58,382 --> 00:41:59,292
First let me look into this matter.

696
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:02,863
Hey, I called up Pemba.
He settled everything.

697
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,795
- My packing is done.
- House is--

698
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,866
- What about your packing?
- How can it be locked?

699
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,633
Maybe they also went on a trip.

700
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:12,398
Hello, this house--

701
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:13,598
Yes, this is a house.

702
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,869
- Mr. Krishnamuflhy.
- Yes, this is Mr. Krishnamuflhy's house.

703
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:16,807
He is not home?

704
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,344
- No, He is not home
- We can see that.

705
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,244
- What happened to him?
- He passed away.

706
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,940
Passed away? How can that happenl?

707
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,414
Somehow it happened.

708
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,383
- Hey! those are clothes?
- Yes, They are clothes.

709
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,454
So someone is staying in the house?

710
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:28,885
Naturally, it's a house.
Someone will stay in it.

711
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:29,990
I mean who?

712
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,388
Not polite to bother others.

713
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,722
Hold him once.

714
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:34,726
Come... come.

715
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,228
- Will you come to Doodh Kashi?
- I will, first hold him.

716
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,093
Hold me... hold me.

717
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:38,892
Hey, what is your problem?

718
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:39,693
Wait.

719
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:44,237
Krishnamuflhy's daughter lives
in the house. Her name is Anandi.

720
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,897
Where is she now?

721
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:49,067
She will be on terrace at this time.

722
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,906
- You go.
- Rishi, come.

723
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,048
Something is happening to the girl.

724
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:56,411
My shares!

725
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,587
- There is nobody here.
- Look here.

726
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,186
I must find Krishnamuflhy's
daughter in this lot.

727
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,420
She alone seems to be his daughter...

728
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,428
...rest look like Krishnamuflhy's
classmates.

729
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,796
The move that I am going
to show you now is Tiger Claw. Okay?

730
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:15,335
This is the best self
defense in Karate. Do it.

731
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,963
Now leg up, yes... kick.

732
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:20,204
Kick... kick.

733
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,501
Au nty!

734
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,941
Nothing happened... nothing to worry.

735
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:25,978
Just ten minutes rest.

736
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:29,379
See! why do they need to do all this
instead of quietly staying in the house?

737
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:30,883
You too join, uncle.

738
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,645
Self defense is necessary
for everyone these days.

739
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,448
What is the need for us?

740
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,750
We are men.

741
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,950
- Oh! really?
- Yes.

742
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,117
Rama aunty, come here. Come.

743
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,490
- Uncle, you too come.
- Why?

744
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:43,688
Come I say.

745
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,800
If you have guts, then touch your wife.

746
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,730
Everyone is there, might not be appropriate.

747
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:52,772
Just Touch her and see,
you will know her power.

748
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,841
I am living with her since 30 years.
I think I know her power.

749
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:58,546
Uncle, just touch, ok!
Aunty, take your attack position.

750
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,012
Aunty, what is this?

751
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:07,280
After all, he is my husband.

752
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,250
This is Anandi?

753
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,926
Hey! Nandi!

754
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,024
Violent girl!

755
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,433
Hey, how come you are here?

756
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:23,936
I said ill be your friend,
so I will not leave you now.

757
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:28,165
Well, yesterday you said your
name is Nandi, now I find out its Anandi.

758
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,276
What is this?

759
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,004
As soon as I say Anandi, every idiot
remembers that girl from the tv serial.

760
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,011
That's why I said Nandi.

761
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:34,841
Actually I am--

762
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,582
This is Chandramukhi.

763
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,055
This is Arundhati... the big one.

764
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,524
This is 'Sitaramaiah gari Manavaralu.'

765
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,062
She is looking at you.

766
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:50,431
Hey, Subbu. Now, THIS is a house.

767
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:51,897
Ok, but where do I sit?

768
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:52,761
Let me show you.

769
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:54,959
Hey... hey. Wait! Wait!

770
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:58,702
- Here.
- Trunk sofa?

771
00:44:59,129 --> 00:44:59,971
Superb!

772
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:02,967
- Your father is Krishnamuflhy, right?
Yes.

773
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,140
- I heard he passed away--
- Ya, Both mom and dad passed away.

774
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:10,615
A Lorry hit them while they were
returning from the market...on the spot.

775
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,913
I've been alone since then.

776
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,456
Hey, Do you drink tea or coffee?

777
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,391
- Coffee for me.
- Tea for me.

778
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,996
Hey, tea for me too.
I don't like coffee at all.

779
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,791
Okay, tea for me too.

780
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,736
Hey, good... nice.

781
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:33,074
Why is she just sitting there?
Should we get it ourselves?

782
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,441
Tea for both of us.

783
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,638
Actually there is nothing in the house.
I asked for the sake of formality.

784
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:42,249
Hey, will you eat paani-puri?

785
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,251
The Old man downstairs makes it very good...
come... come.

786
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,584
Hey, what happened?

787
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,249
- Maybe She asked this also for formality.
Hey, come.?

788
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:56,188
Regarding my business, I want to--
Small Problem--

789
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:57,832
- Hi, Sreeja!
- Hi!

790
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,362
- I searched everywhere for you.
- What?

791
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,934
You are not coming for
playing shuttle these days.

792
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,662
My marriage is on 23rd.
You should definitely come.

793
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,372
Marriage? you??

794
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:10,034
What happened?

795
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,506
Everyone is getting married.

796
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,373
I am going to be left alone.

797
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,180
Oh! But what's the hurry for your marriage?

798
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,786
What's the hurry for your marriage thenl?

799
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,616
Mother, I am coming!

800
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,617
Why are you sitting?
Don't you want paani-puri?

801
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:31,561
Hold it.

802
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,565
For you--

803
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,565
I don't want paani, puri is enough.

804
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:39,966
Who is he?

805
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,801
Hey, how will you eat paani-puri
without paani? Come... come.

806
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,912
He is like that only. He acts smart

807
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,570
It will take lot of time
to tell you all his antics.

808
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:47,545
I will tell later.

809
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:51,644
Hey, how is it?

810
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:53,346
Superb!

811
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,491
It is nice, but best paani-puri
is only in Kolkata.

812
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,092
Wow! Kolkata?

813
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,493
I haven't gone anywhere except
to Tirupati...for Girija's marriage.

814
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,653
Do you know I haven't
even gone out of the state?

815
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,821
Should I tell you something?

816
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,661
Your life...live however you want.

817
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,329
True...

818
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:14,208
Sometimes I fear how shod our life is,
when I imagine how big the world is.

819
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,737
Hey, you're like me!

820
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,705
Hey an idea! Come to Kolkata with me.
I will make you eat best paani-puri.

821
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:22,349
- Deal?
- Deal!

822
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,841
When?

823
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,521
We should go to Kolkata on
our way to Doodh Kashi.

824
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,687
My parents too live there,
you can meet my mom.

825
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:29,847
Actually my friend Pemba--

826
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:34,860
Hey, actually I came
to talk about some business.

827
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,130
Oh! Not to meet me?

828
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:40,933
I came for your dad. He worked in
Mr. Ramaiah's company, right?

829
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:42,229
Yes.

830
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:43,962
He has some shares in his name--

831
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,538
<i>- Oh'. Shares').
- Hey'.!</i>

832
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,470
What happened?

833
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:49,877
Oh! Now those shares are in my name.

834
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,707
I had received call from Ramaiah
Company asking for them.

835
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,543
How lucky!

836
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:55,706
I forgot completely.

837
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,217
Had you not reminded then,
I would have totally forgot.

838
00:47:58,609 --> 00:47:59,917
- N0!!
- What?

839
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,715
I want those shares. I will buy them.

840
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,722
But, He asked first.

841
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,724
I will give you more money.

842
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,162
- Will you give any amount?
- Yes, How much ever.

843
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,564
Chi! I don't do things for money.

844
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,266
I do things only if I feel like it.

845
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,734
And now I surely don't like how you're
trying to bribe me like old-time movie villain.

846
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,430
- Bye.
- Bye.

847
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:20,539
She is right for you.

848
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:24,078
Ms. Anandi! Ms. Anandi!

849
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,907
Actually I am sorry,
I didn't mean it like that.

850
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,812
These shares are very important for me.
I am depending on you. Please Think about it.

851
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,076
Okay, I will think tomorrow.

852
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,586
- Tomorrow?
Today is Friday.

853
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,780
Lord Shani's influence is more.

854
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:37,356
We shouldn't stafl any new work.

855
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:41,792
I have to go. Rama aunty
said she will put henna for me.

856
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,464
Hey, will you too put henna?

857
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,463
My shares--

858
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:49,928
Okay, we will meet tomorrow.

859
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:55,841
Why did we come here?

860
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,876
- My shares--
- They are coming out today!

861
00:48:58,535 --> 00:48:59,206
What's coming out?

862
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,710
Welcome to butterfly park.

863
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:08,812
Butterflies!

864
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,291
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Have they come?

865
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,389
Sorry, dear. They came out
in the morning before I arrived.

866
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,296
Aww!! I missed them again.

867
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:20,593
I'm trying since so long
to see a butterfly when it comes out.

868
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:21,801
Bad luck!

869
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,000
What about them?

870
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:24,798
Where?

871
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,498
There is still time for them.

872
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,644
It is very rare to
see butterflies coming out.

873
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:32,574
I myself have never seen it in
these 50 years.

874
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:42,985
These caterpillars just eat and eat.
Non-stop.

875
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,493
They eat thousands of times more than
their body's weight.

876
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:51,664
But the same Insects that spoiled
the trees by eating them...

877
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:55,835
...will turn into butterflies
and then save the tree again by pollination.

878
00:49:56,093 --> 00:50:00,166
Man is destroying this
earth by eating everything like an insect.

879
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:04,268
He has forgotten that there is a
butterfly hidden inside him.

880
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:08,115
A man can learn
everything in this world...

881
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:11,184
...from a butterfly.
- Free like a butterfly.

882
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:18,391
Everyone is crack!

883
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,520
Hi!

884
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,023
So what did you think?

885
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:24,058
Hey, don't kill the fly.

886
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:26,360
It will be reborn and seek revenge again.

887
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,295
Fly?

888
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,295
It is not that... my shares?

889
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:33,463
Oh, that?

890
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:36,710
I cannot take such decisions easily.

891
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,813
Not about the money...

892
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:41,779
...but I should get a
feeling that it is correct.

893
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,917
I mean approximately
when you will get this feeling.

894
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,180
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

895
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:47,913
Yes, let's meet tomorrow.

896
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,722
She is bringing to a new place daily.
Whose house is this?

897
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,056
My friend's house.

898
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:57,493
Will your legs melt if you
stand patiently for two minutes?

899
00:50:57,654 --> 00:50:58,598
Granny!

900
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:02,336
She is my grandmother Susheela.

901
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,472
She is getting more Glamourous with age.

902
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:07,131
Enough! Don't stand like a statue here.

903
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,573
- Go inside.
- Okay.

904
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:12,672
Hmm.

905
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,507
Should I invite both of you specially?

906
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,123
First keep your legs down.

907
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:26,950
What is this beard? fashion?

908
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,954
No, granny.
I had grown it casually.

909
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:30,153
Your face!

910
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:32,433
See his face, your friend.

911
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,762
Why can't you be like that? Neat.

912
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,872
What do you do? Government job?

913
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:41,669
Or this job of sitting in front of computer
and pressing buttons.

914
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:46,440
No! No! I am a investment banker.
I came to talk about shares with Anandi...

915
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,605
...and she got me here.
- What are these clothes?

916
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,010
There are so many tears.

917
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:54,252
Do you think anyone will give
you job by looking at you?

918
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,618
What if nobody gives me a job, granny?

919
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,721
I'll come and stay with you
without any salary.

920
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:03,160
I can take care of my work thank you,
but you go and shave your beard first.

921
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,390
Well said, granny.

922
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,033
You shut up! Keep quiet!

923
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,662
What is this? The Medicines are
just like that.

924
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,004
Doctor told you to
take them on time, right?

925
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:13,737
You are suffering from Blood Pressure.

926
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:15,567
I am telling for the last time.
Take them.

927
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:18,144
- Your nagging has become intolerable.
- Granny!

928
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,745
- Gems?
- Do you want them?

929
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,251
First tablet.

930
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,314
Give it.

931
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:39,933
Only two? Give more.

932
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:43,027
I am going to a place
called Doodh Kashi with them.

933
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:46,172
Who is she? Your maternal
grandmother or paternal grandmother?

934
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,708
Neither, im not related. ljust like to spend
time with her at least once a week.

935
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,539
I do the entire household work.

936
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,510
Oh! Like a helper in an old age home.

937
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:56,015
God didn't give me grandmother.

938
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,652
That's why I found my own.

939
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,252
Do you just do anyihing, so randomly?

940
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:03,083
Not anything,
I do whatever I feel like doing.

941
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:06,558
I will make this mad
girl sign today at any cost.

942
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:08,889
You keep nagging her of shares
daily and one day...

943
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:11,191
...she will go climb a tree.

944
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:12,765
- Madam! Madam!
- She already has.

945
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:13,697
Do you think there is nobody to ask?

946
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,461
Give it, madam.
I have to cut the tree.

947
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,070
Otherwise I will lose myjob.

948
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:18,103
How can you cut a tree?

949
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:19,197
- It wrong, right?
- Madam...

950
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,636
...everyone cuts the trees
in rainy season? What's wrong?

951
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,799
What if somebody broke your house wall,
is that ok?

952
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:24,809
Not today,
I think her mood is not good.

953
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:26,311
No, it should happen today only.

954
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,039
She has an axe in her hand.
Let us come tomorrow.

955
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:28,706
Come.

956
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,910
Nandi! Nandi! Nandi!

957
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,384
Where have you been?

958
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,851
- Everything is finished.
- Hey, what happened?

959
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:42,494
She left without telling me.

960
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:48,833
- She left without telling anything.
- Who?

961
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:51,962
Chandramukhi.

962
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:11,322
Chandramukhi, I didn't think
that you too will leave me and go.

963
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,457
Such a talented fish!

964
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:17,429
I miss her.

965
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:24,871
Chandramukhi.

966
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,174
I don't know her well, but...

967
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:31,043
...when I saw her,
I immediately knew she was a good swimmer.

968
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,541
It is a very good fish.

969
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:34,443
Hey.

970
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,344
Hmm.

971
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:41,219
Chandramukhi.

972
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,454
Chandramukhi.

973
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,551
It is a gold fish. It is also called...

974
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,124
...which is a fresh water
fish from the family of...

975
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,789
It is one ofthe earliest
to be domesticated...

976
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,730
...and one of the most commonly
kept aquarium fish.

977
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,733
It relatively belongs to
the small member ofthe carp family--

978
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:56,836
Hey.

979
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,404
- Google aa?
- Wikipedia.

980
00:54:58,561 --> 00:54:59,938
- Enough now.
- Okay.

981
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:06,044
Riya called after so many days.

982
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:08,646
Everything is set!

983
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:10,214
Sure?

984
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,583
- What?
- About Riya?

985
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,483
Of course sure, 100 percent sure.

986
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,884
I already talked to Anandi
and anyiime now ill have those shares.

987
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,650
Okay... okay... Lock?

988
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,484
Mr. Computer, lock A, Riya.

989
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,820
It looks like some accident took place.

990
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,229
Auto turned upside down.

991
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:26,560
Hey, stop! Stop!

992
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,828
Hey, there are people,
they will take care of it.

993
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,062
Rishi!

994
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,066
Hey!

995
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:38,504
Did you call for an ambulance?

996
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,246
Does anybody know about the ambulance!!

997
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,484
- Who called?
- Don't know.

998
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,018
Why is everyone nodding their heads?
Subbu, we need to take her to the hospital.

999
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,780
Hey, if we call an ambulance,
they will look into it.

1000
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:49,355
If everyone thinks like that,
nothing will happen!!

1001
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:54,421
Looks like her head is injured.

1002
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:55,728
Lot of blood!

1003
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:57,523
- Door! Door! Door!
- One minute!

1004
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:59,758
What are you doing?!

1005
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,365
Let's go.

1006
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:08,367
Subbu! Start! Start!

1007
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:11,105
<i>- Come on'. How hug'?
- Okay').!</i>

1008
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,046
- Subbu, fast!
- I am going fast!

1009
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,809
Overtake them!

1010
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:20,983
- Subbu, fast!
- Hey, move! Move aside!

1011
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:24,917
Madam, hold her tight
so that blood is not lost.

1012
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,058
Subbu, lot of bleeding.

1013
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,821
Move aside! Move aside!

1014
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,825
- Drive!
- I am driving!

1015
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,127
Drive faster! Faster! !

1016
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,929
Baby! Baby! Get up, baby!

1017
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,602
The Hospital should be somewhere here.

1018
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:52,578
- Doctor!
- Yes!

1019
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:53,618
Doctor! Emergency!

1020
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:55,017
Yes, come!

1021
00:56:58,648 --> 00:56:59,820
Hello? Riya.

1022
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,200
Nothing... I am coming.

1023
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,443
What is this..We are just sitting
here since morning,

1024
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,212
and they made this girl sit on this branch.

1025
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:31,052
Poor girl, so skinny.
They haven't given her any food also.

1026
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:40,460
Shit!

1027
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,098
Hey.

1028
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:52,740
You are looking amazing, Riya.

1029
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:56,377
Do you why I chose you, Subbu?

1030
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,081
Because you were the best.

1031
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:04,585
I thought id be on the Vogue magazine's cover
and you on the Forbes magazine cover.

1032
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,220
We would make the dream couple.

1033
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:09,391
Everyone will talk about us.

1034
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:11,933
Everyone would want to be like us.

1035
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:14,864
Hey, relax, Riya. I am working on it.

1036
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:16,660
The Shares matter is almost solved.

1037
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,635
It is actually very simple, Subbu.

1038
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:20,968
I am going back to America in two weeks.

1039
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,337
If the Ramaiah's deal is
cracked before that, then Great.

1040
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,036
Madam, your shot is ready.

1041
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,013
Otherwise--

1042
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:46,196
Rishi!

1043
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:48,734
Rishi!

1044
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,442
Hey, Rishi!

1045
00:58:57,901 --> 00:58:59,642
What? Inside--

1046
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:01,914
It was too late.

1047
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,047
What happened?

1048
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:07,818
That girl...

1049
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:12,156
...died.

1050
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,158
Such a young girl.

1051
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:21,160
10 years old...
what did she see of life?

1052
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,734
In my hands.

1053
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:28,834
Hey.

1054
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:33,243
What can we do?
We did whatever we could, it is okay.

1055
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,746
No! It is not okay!

1056
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:37,075
How the fuck is it ok!

1057
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:44,781
Do you know what the doctor said?

1058
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:49,486
Had you brought 10 minutes
before then she would have lived.

1059
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,021
There were so many people around!

1060
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:55,494
Girl was bleeding on the road...

1061
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,797
...and they were all watching like sheep.

1062
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:01,201
No..not sheep...
Even Sheep would react.

1063
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:04,501
Like zombies...
they stood like zombies!

1064
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:09,539
You thought they will take care.. they think
others will take care... 10 minutes.

1065
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,876
- Hey, don't over react.
- I should react!

1066
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:15,117
We are alive!

1067
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,223
We all should react!

1068
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,894
All of us have killed her together.

1069
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:29,030
Not like this... no.

1070
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:32,537
- Come... this is not right.
- Rishi!

1071
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,968
Listen to me, stay here.

1072
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,072
I will find a good job for you.
Settle down here.

1073
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:40,146
- Forget Doodh Kashi and crap.
- This is not life!

1074
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,911
This is not life!

1075
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:45,046
These people... this selfishness.

1076
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,082
I don't know how I should tell you.

1077
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:49,152
This is not life!

1078
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:51,559
Life is not about earning money.

1079
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:54,559
There is so much more to life!!

1080
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,455
- Come with me. Come.
- Hey!

1081
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:59,533
Hundreds of people die daily.
Life will not move forward if we sit and cry.

1082
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:00,928
Is it moving forward now?

1083
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,334
Is this forvvard?...

1084
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,866
...without having any responsibility.

1085
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:06,268
How can you talk about responsibility?

1086
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:09,672
- Did you do even one job properly?
- That is my life. My wish!

1087
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:11,510
At least I am living.

1088
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:15,678
Not like you, for promotion, status.

1089
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,743
I'm not marrying my <i>boss's</i>
daughter and selling my life.

1090
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,316
That is not promotion.

1091
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:21,954
- Its Prostitution!
- Hey!

1092
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,086
Don't dare say One more word!
who are you?

1093
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:27,027
Who are you to talk about my life?

1094
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,185
I am tolerating you because
you are my childhood friend.

1095
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:32,763
Leaving your parents responsibility,
you are roaming places by begging.

1096
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:35,124
Don't go there.

1097
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,130
I will go anywhere.
This is my house, my wish.

1098
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:41,705
I am not staying in other's
house like a beggar.

1099
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:45,212
By the way, who are you to tell me?

1100
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:47,706
Iam telling you again...

1101
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,210
...ambition, status, money!
This is the world!

1102
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:57,150
If this is the world.

1103
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:58,887
If this is world...

1104
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:01,786
...l don't want to have anything
to do with this world.

1105
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:08,731
Fine!! Go away!

1106
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:14,166
Hello! Rishi! Rishi!

1107
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:18,438
Rishi! What are you doing here?

1108
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:19,909
I was searching the
entire school for you.

1109
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,605
Subbu, see there.

1110
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:24,251
This nest would have fallen
down due to rain, but now its safe.

1111
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:27,019
Okay, but I heard
you didn't submit your science project.

1112
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:31,024
Today is the late date for submission.

1113
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:34,660
Where is your project?

1114
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:37,855
What? You tore your project
to suppofl the nest??

1115
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,624
Its 20 marks man!

1116
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:41,928
Hey, Don't panic?
I will write it again.

1117
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,763
I don't understand this guy...
Hey, is this yours?

1118
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,142
Yes.

1119
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:56,511
See yours...
how expensive and awesome it is.

1120
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:00,943
See mine... boring and useless.

1121
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,548
Did you like it? Take it.

1122
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:04,790
What?!

1123
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:09,324
Hey, it will cost at least 200 rupees.

1124
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:11,556
Mine is just 20 rupees.

1125
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,998
Not at all a good deal!

1126
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,369
There are no deals in friendship man!

1127
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:19,973
Sure? Because if you
give once then no returns.

1128
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,836
Of course I'm sure! You are my best friendl!

1129
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:27,264
Is the hangover over?
Shut up and come home now.

1130
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:30,536
Hello. I am Inspector Ramakant speaking.

1131
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,270
An accident occurred at Shadnagar.

1132
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:36,348
Spot dead! Body was lying
there whole night, nobody bothered.

1133
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:38,485
This is the last dialled
number from the phone.

1134
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:40,482
Hello? Hello!

1135
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:42,579
Body is in JJ Hospital.

1136
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,747
Call back if you want any details.

1137
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:01,768
Hello?

1138
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:05,170
Hello?

1139
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,275
Hello?

1140
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:54,488
You won't find him in any photo.

1141
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,831
Only his Bag or his bike.
That's it.

1142
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:01,061
Since four years...

1143
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:05,164
...l am seeing his life
through these moments.

1144
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:06,306
Four years?

1145
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:10,872
You know how stubborn he
is since childhood.

1146
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:15,909
He does whatever he likes.

1147
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:19,484
He has a big fight with his father.

1148
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:21,415
Father got angry...

1149
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:24,888
...and said not to show
his face again. That's it.

1150
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,161
I didn't think he will leave me forever
without showing me his face.

1151
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:36,498
I want to see him once more.

1152
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,607
Just once more, I want to hear his laugh.

1153
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,269
My son.

1154
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,210
He had such a big head.

1155
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:51,276
If anybody was in trouble...

1156
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:52,848
...he reached out first.

1157
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,884
My Rishi is a beautiful soul!

1158
01:06:58,381 --> 01:06:59,621
I was always afraid.

1159
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:02,395
Where is he? What is he doing?

1160
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,029
At least he had you.

1161
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,094
The Last call...

1162
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:11,427
...he made the last call, to you.

1163
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:17,035
Don't cry, madam.

1164
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:19,639
Control yourself.

1165
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:21,974
Come.

1166
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:42,395
Hello? Yes, Riya.

1167
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,697
All the ceremonies are over.
I am coming tomorrow.

1168
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:48,134
Aunty, so sorry!

1169
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:50,576
This shouldn't have happened to Rishi.

1170
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,144
I was shocked to hear the news.

1171
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:53,609
Riya, I will call you later.

1172
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:57,808
Subbu! What is this?

1173
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,344
I can't believe this.

1174
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:00,680
How did you come here?

1175
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,448
- What is this?
- Rishi left this with me.

1176
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:05,353
<i>$0'?</i>

1177
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:08,093
Subbu, why did I meet Rishi?

1178
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,594
Why did he tell me about Doodh Kashi?

1179
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:14,566
He left the most important
thing of his life with me...

1180
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:15,827
"what does this mean?

1181
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:18,996
It is destiny. He is telling
us to finish his journey.

1182
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:21,197
Don't talk rubbish.
There is nothing.

1183
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:24,003
No destiny, no journey,
no Doodh Kashi, no Rishi-

1184
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,270
Rishi is not there.

1185
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:48,495
Hi, uncle. I am so sorry.

1186
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:50,966
It is okay. Who are you?

1187
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,630
My name is Nandi.
Rishi's best friend.

1188
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,640
Actually we three are best friends.
Come, Subbu.

1189
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,038
Subbu, your friend?

1190
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,639
Uncle, you are not like Rishi at all.

1191
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,307
Maybe he has taken after aunty.

1192
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:07,010
Uncle, I have to ask you something.

1193
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:09,053
Do you know about Doodh Kashi?

1194
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:13,583
Uncle, I mean Rishi
must have told you.

1195
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:17,025
This secret Lake in the Himalayas...
Rishi found the way.

1196
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:20,531
Now Subbu and I are going with him.

1197
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:22,066
What are you talking about?

1198
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:24,233
Uncle, we want Rishi's ashes.

1199
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:26,430
We will take it to Doodh Kashi.

1200
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:28,298
- Get out!
- Uncle, listen to...

1201
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:29,340
Get out!!!

1202
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:33,343
He spent his entire
life in that madness.

1203
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:36,176
It has killed him.

1204
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,681
Now you don't start it again.

1205
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,615
Uncle, please... please...
listen to me.

1206
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:40,776
Not another word!

1207
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:43,080
Get out before I call the security!

1208
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:44,617
- Sorry, uncle.
- Out!

1209
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,123
Uncle, it is not that.

1210
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:52,595
- Why does he shout like that?
- Have you gone mad?

1211
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:55,463
How can you ask for ashes
like as if you're asking for some address?

1212
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,964
Do you know why I made you
run around without giving you the shares?

1213
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:02,974
Nobody stays with me.

1214
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:04,509
Everyone leaves me and goes.

1215
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:10,106
But that day in the bar, you found
me as if you came searching for me.

1216
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:13,612
You said we were friends,
you took me into your group.

1217
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,117
I felt so happy.

1218
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,119
I thought you too will leave me
if I give the shares.

1219
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,824
Rishi anyway has left.

1220
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:31,833
I will give those shares, I don't care.

1221
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:35,439
But we have to take Rishi's
ashes to Doodh Kashi.

1222
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:39,510
He had a hundred ideas,
we can't just blindly leave everyihing-

1223
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,506
It is a sign, Subbu.

1224
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,679
Rishi would have wanted us to do this.

1225
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:45,777
Only you can help me! Please!

1226
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,025
- What is this boost bottle?
- It must be under the table.

1227
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:53,592
What is all this?

1228
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:01,931
Hey, it should be here.

1229
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:05,098
It's not here, let's go.

1230
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,434
It has to be there. See properly.

1231
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,768
I knew you would come.

1232
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:17,376
He always treated you more
like a brother than a friend.

1233
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:21,113
That fact that You are doing this for him,

1234
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,015
...he is blessed to have friends like you.

1235
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:27,453
Surely he too would have wanted this...

1236
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:31,498
Au nt--

1237
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:32,632
What is that?

1238
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:36,296
Boost... ashes...
Anandi... Doodh Kashi.

1239
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:37,969
That's right.

1240
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,569
It was His favourite.

1241
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:44,737
Here...

1242
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:48,648
Take Rishi to Doodh Kashi.

1243
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,162
Till Ganga.

1244
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:08,929
- It looks like airport.
- Airport?

1245
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:10,760
If we give these planes to
a scrap dealer...

1246
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,206
...he will ask us for money in return.

1247
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:17,939
Pemba!

1248
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:19,942
Pemba!

1249
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:23,342
Pemba! Pemba! Pemba!

1250
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:26,243
Finished? Satisfied? Shall we leave?

1251
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:28,620
All of Rishi's plans are like this only.

1252
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:29,517
Rishi?

1253
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,021
- Anandi!
- Subbu!

1254
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:31,715
Subbu?

1255
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,421
- Pemba!
- Pemba!

1256
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:37,691
- Yes!
- Pemba! Pemba! Pemba!

1257
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:39,928
Thank God, we found you.

1258
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:41,864
Thank God, but who are you.

1259
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:45,597
My friend Rishi wrote
your name in Doodh Kashi's map.

1260
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:48,367
- Oh, Rishi? Hello.
- Wait... wait?

1261
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,770
Not that, listen fully.

1262
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:52,104
- This is Rishi.
- Rishi?

1263
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:53,640
This is boost.

1264
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:57,210
His Ashes... he died.

1265
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,544
Oh God!

1266
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:01,577
I am so sorry.

1267
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,652
Subbu? Anandi?

1268
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:06,217
Good. Come.

1269
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:08,155
Now we have to take
him to Doodh Kashi.

1270
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:09,819
Why do you keep saying we?
My car is waiting outside.

1271
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:10,827
I will tell you.

1272
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:12,090
- Thank you.
- This is my friend's plane...

1273
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:12,994
...and I am the only pilot.

1274
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:14,691
Pilot? He looks like
a bullock-cad driver.

1275
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:15,665
But you have to pay money.

1276
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:17,394
- What else do you want? Tell me.
- Nothing.

1277
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:18,560
- Only money.
- Subbu, say okay.

1278
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:20,001
Why don't understand my troubles.

1279
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:21,163
Ifl don't acquire Ramaiah's
company in the city...

1280
01:13:21,296 --> 01:13:23,071
...my marriage, career...
everything will be finished.

1281
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,506
- Subbu!
- Hey! Hey!

1282
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,638
You go around carrying those papers,
right? Do you have them now?

1283
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:29,874
Yes..of course...
you can sign then even now too.

1284
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:31,847
Actually I said I will give
20 percent premium too...

1285
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:33,247
...you didn't care all these days.
- Subbu.

1286
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,854
- One minute.
- Subbu.

1287
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:38,022
Rishi travelled to so many places.

1288
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,018
He could have visited
Doodh Kashi also...

1289
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:42,925
...but he wanted
to go with you, Subbu.

1290
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:46,029
Do you know how many times he told me?

1291
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:49,599
Subbu, this trip will have
a meaning only if you come.

1292
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,696
Rishi's soul will be happy.

1293
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:55,468
If you last wish was to
visit some stock exchange...

1294
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:57,542
...then Rishi would have
definitely fulfilled it.

1295
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:59,742
Subbu, I don't want money. You come.

1296
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:01,677
I... I will give those
shares to you for free.

1297
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:03,043
- Deal?
- Yes.

1298
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,983
- How much you want?
- Only 100 dollars per day.

1299
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:07,719
What happened?

1300
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:09,352
' MY Purse--
<i>'</i> N0 money?

1301
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:11,883
- What?
- Subbu, show me.

1302
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:13,615
Nice watch.

1303
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,923
You can buy a Business class ticket to London
if I sell this watch.

1304
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:18,325
Then go to London.

1305
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:20,898
Hey...ok..wait.

1306
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,130
Here.

1307
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,966
Good! Very good!

1308
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:32,972
I love your decision. Come on.

1309
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:34,639
Push!

1310
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:37,642
What push?
Does he think its a share-auto?

1311
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,987
It has starting problem,
so you have to push.

1312
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,648
Push! More push! Anandi, push!

1313
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,988
Easy for you...
You are sitting like a pig inside...

1314
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,028
...and telling us to push.
- Subbu, push.

1315
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,933
- Yes! Started!
- Come on!

1316
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:01,272
- Come! Come! Sit! Sit!
- Come fast!

1317
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:02,874
Come inside!

1318
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:05,671
Give it! Get in! Get it!

1319
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,641
Hey, slowly.

1320
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:09,714
Are you okay?

1321
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:10,778
I would have died!

1322
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:12,779
So exciting!

1323
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:16,855
Please fasten your seat belts.

1324
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:18,389
Hey! There are no seat belts.

1325
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:20,959
Yes. Only said for formality.

1326
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:23,861
Why did I come here?
How did I get into this?

1327
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:25,965
This is crazy. I'm going to die.
I have to get down.

1328
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:29,534
- Stop.
- Fly high!

1329
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:32,535
Like a diamond in the sky!

1330
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,761
Doodh Kashi is very holy lake.

1331
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:00,565
In olden days,
it would take many years to reach...

1332
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,759
...but you are very
lucky to have my plane.

1333
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:03,869
Lucky ??

1334
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:05,562
This is the first time
lam sitting in plane.

1335
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:07,331
This is probably my last time.

1336
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:13,010
Get ready for landing.

1337
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:15,614
Landing? I can't see the airport.

1338
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:17,580
Airport? Haha!

1339
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:23,079
This is not a landing,
it is called crashing.

1340
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:26,953
Finished!

1341
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,187
It's all over!

1342
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:41,037
Welcome to Himalayas!

1343
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:43,473
Now get out!

1344
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:46,946
Take care... take care... both of you.

1345
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:49,446
Come on!

1346
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:52,346
I think he worked in a circus before.

1347
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:55,348
Anandi.

1348
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:58,983
Stand there... hold the bottle up.

1349
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:01,885
Nice pose... Very good. Fantastic!

1350
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,462
Okay, nice.
Doodh Kashi is very nice. Let us go.

1351
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:05,794
What?

1352
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,865
I mean Doodh Kashi is very nice.
It is bit cold but...

1353
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:09,468
...it is okay. Let us go.

1354
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,968
This is not Doodh Kashi.

1355
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:12,628
Doodh Kashi is further away.

1356
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:14,171
You should have taken us there,
why did you drop us here?

1357
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:16,240
No plane there, only walk.

1358
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:17,843
How far from here.

1359
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:22,380
5 days, 10 days, maybe more than 15 days.

1360
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:25,477
Give my watch back.

1361
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,518
Okay. Relax.

1362
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:28,916
I will take you up to there...

1363
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:31,557
...but you have to
pay me 100 dollars per day.

1364
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,050
No need.

1365
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:34,489
I have my GPS with me.
I will go myself.

1366
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,425
- Hey, Nice mobile.
- Stay back! I will not give this.

1367
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:38,394
- Do you have the map with you?
- Yes...

1368
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,656
It is better to trust Google than him.
Come, I will take you.

1369
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:41,823
- But what do we know, Subbu.
- Hello! Wait!

1370
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,492
- Come.
- Not that way!

1371
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,297
- This way.
- We know.

1372
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,701
Welcome to Google maps.

1373
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:52,941
Keep going straight.

1374
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:55,411
After 200 metres.

1375
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:57,514
Why did it stop?

1376
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:00,578
Hello?

1377
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:02,379
- Take a right.
- It is there.

1378
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:03,147
Go straight.

1379
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:05,689
Keep going on.
Further?

1380
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:14,528
- And then?
- Take a right.

1381
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:17,301
Take a right.

1382
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:19,704
Take a right.

1383
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:26,209
Keep climbing till
you reach flat ground.

1384
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:35,819
How far, Subbu?

1385
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:38,587
- Pemba can help us.
- No need.

1386
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:44,563
Now keep going straight
for 100 metres.

1387
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,324
Where do you want us to go? See.

1388
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:48,499
You want to kill me? Tell me?!

1389
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:50,102
Now go straight.

1390
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:57,335
Oh. Subbu...

1391
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,144
lam feeling hungry.

1392
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:02,345
Is there anything in your bag?

1393
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:03,639
Ooh...You're feeling hungry?

1394
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:06,146
Eat me! Eat me!

1395
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:09,116
- All this is because of you.
- Done blame me!

1396
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:10,620
Pemba said he will take us.

1397
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:13,088
You only said Google maps, this-that
and brought us here.

1398
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:14,591
No! No!

1399
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:16,758
No!

1400
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:19,192
- What happened?
- Battery dead!

1401
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:25,434
Subbu, are you afraid of ghosts?

1402
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,366
I heard they like living on mountains.

1403
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:30,837
Mountain spirits!

1404
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:32,171
Is that topic necessary now?

1405
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,304
Don't worry, Subbu.

1406
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:36,139
All ghosts are not the same.

1407
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:39,278
- Some are good too.
- Who told you?

1408
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:40,977
- Granny told me.
- ls it?

1409
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:48,224
Look, I think that's one.

1410
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,058
Good one or bad one?

1411
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:02,639
Come! Come!

1412
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:05,076
Head down! Head down!

1413
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:23,324
Too much cold outside.

1414
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:25,491
Thank you.

1415
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:31,834
Good night.

1416
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:33,768
- Bye.
- Okay.

1417
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:50,214
Yellamma! Coffee!

1418
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:11,771
"The beautiful sky."

1419
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:15,681
"Which poet's imagination is this..."

1420
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:19,877
"Which poet's imagination
is this miracle?"

1421
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:23,215
"Who is the painter?"

1422
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:28,049
All is good.

1423
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:30,086
Sleep well?

1424
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:32,323
Sleep well, my foot!

1425
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:33,659
Subbu, see.

1426
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:35,233
Rishi's purse. So what?

1427
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:36,727
This is the money Rishi got
for selling Dada.

1428
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,270
Everything is happening
according to Rishi's plan.

1429
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:41,737
Rishi is taking us to Doodh Kashi.

1430
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:44,503
Now we have money for Pemba.

1431
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:46,502
<i>QKZV -</i>

1432
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:50,342
Now Pemba will take
you to Doodh Kashi.

1433
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:51,108
<i>Okay'?</i>

1434
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:19,473
Wow! Looking so pretty.

1435
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:21,808
- Come. Come. Sit here.
- Thank you.

1436
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:25,348
Where is Subbu?

1437
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:27,783
- He is still inside.
- Inside?

1438
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,320
- Okay.
- I am ready.

1439
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:31,483
Are you ready?

1440
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:39,695
So funny!

1441
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:44,563
Now Subbu, Anandi.

1442
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:47,865
Here we begin ourjourney to Doodh Kashi.

1443
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:17,426
What a wonderful view!

1444
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:18,501
Look, Anandi.

1445
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:21,498
Hello! Riyal!

1446
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:22,437
Hello, Subbu.

1447
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:23,701
- Yes.
Hello?

1448
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:25,003
Signal is weak.

1449
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,203
Subbu, can you hear me now?

1450
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:29,178
Yes, signal is there!
You wait.

1451
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:31,112
I am coming. Can you hear me now?

1452
01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:32,342
Yes!

1453
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:33,247
What about the shares?

1454
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:37,117
Two, three days... that's all.

1455
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:39,391
Hello? Hello?

1456
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:43,192
Why did it get cut?

1457
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:45,364
What a funny fellow!

1458
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:51,270
Subbu, Anandi.

1459
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:53,929
Welcome to the mountain luxury hotel.

1460
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:55,335
Okay mountain but where is luxury.

1461
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:56,202
Come inside.

1462
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:57,866
- It is so cute.
- Cute?

1463
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,478
- Very beautiful. Come.
- Beautiful?

1464
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:01,636
As long as he doesn't make
us sleep next to a cow again.

1465
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:03,539
This is your room. Get in.

1466
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:10,620
You said room, it looks
like store room. Who are they?

1467
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:11,723
Your room mates.

1468
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:15,555
I might compromise regarding room
but I'm very particular about the toilet.

1469
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:16,718
Show me.

1470
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,231
Welcome to the mountain toilet!

1471
01:24:22,824 --> 01:24:24,633
How can this be a toilet!
There is no toilet paper also?

1472
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:26,067
Use leaves.

1473
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,001
I will never!

1474
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:33,308
- It has been one month since I came.
- Oh.

1475
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:35,675
This is all a new experience for me.

1476
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,415
Hey, Subbu! Subbu!

1477
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:41,781
His name is Robert. He says he is
staying in this area since one month.

1478
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:42,921
Greetings.

1479
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,817
I felt very sad after hearing
about your friend Rishi.

1480
01:24:45,947 --> 01:24:49,451
What you are doing
for him is really great.

1481
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:51,426
Apparently he has no plan at all.

1482
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:54,829
He doesn't even know when he
will go back to his country.

1483
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:56,594
Just taking it one day at a time.

1484
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:57,930
Just Like Rishi, isn't it?

1485
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,834
Yes, like Rishi.

1486
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:01,099
He doesn't know what to do in life...

1487
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:04,209
...and also no money to live in city,
so he is roaming in the mountains.

1488
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:05,708
Subbu.

1489
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:08,203
Did I say something wrong?

1490
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,406
- I am sorry.
- Yes, you should be sorry!

1491
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:13,416
There should be some responsibility.
Work, ambition.

1492
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:15,521
Who will make the world go round?

1493
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,620
What will happen to the
world if everybody is aimless like this?

1494
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:19,383
You are just wasting your life.

1495
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:25,153
It was a pleasure meeting both of you.

1496
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:28,392
And all the best for your journey.

1497
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:32,736
And ifl have hurt your friend,
I am sorry.

1498
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:33,668
Take care.

1499
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:39,903
What is your problem?

1500
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:41,513
Why did you talk
so rudely to Robefl?

1501
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:42,909
Who the hell is Robefl?
Why are we here?

1502
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:44,812
I can't even pronounce
the name ofthe place we are in?

1503
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,680
My life was perfect until a week ago.

1504
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:48,684
I was becoming CEO of the company,
got engaged to Riya...

1505
01:25:48,843 --> 01:25:50,413
...l had a car,
house and everything.

1506
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:54,048
Now I just have that Pemba,
his horse, the horses dung and the stink of dung.

1507
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:56,684
And every day all we have are these momos!
I'm sick of them!

1508
01:25:56,851 --> 01:25:57,693
By trusting Pemba's words...

1509
01:25:57,852 --> 01:25:59,058
...we are going to some place which
we don't know if it exists or not.

1510
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:00,255
- Subbu! Subbu! Relax.
- Anybody will think we are mad.

1511
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:02,162
Why think, we are indeed mad.

1512
01:26:03,858 --> 01:26:04,768
Breathe.

1513
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:07,502
Breathe out.

1514
01:26:08,029 --> 01:26:10,532
Ok, tell me... how was Subbu as a child?

1515
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:12,700
There were no business
problems at that time, right?

1516
01:26:12,867 --> 01:26:16,041
I decided in 9th class that
software will not have a future.

1517
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:18,184
I predicted MBA will have value.

1518
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:22,014
So I stayed one step ahead of everyone
and today I am in this position.

1519
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:24,183
So much over action in 9th class only?

1520
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:26,891
So did you do things
which kids ofthat age would do?

1521
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:28,721
Cricket, football.

1522
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:31,022
Talent in sports is
seen in the first ten years.

1523
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:35,032
They was not practical use in playing them
just for fun, so I stopped.

1524
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,635
Dear God!

1525
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:42,038
At least girls...
crushes... love stories.

1526
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,767
Yes, yes. There are many.

1527
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:46,538
Hey, thank God. Tell me.

1528
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:48,977
But I realised they are feelings
which come out of...

1529
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:51,049
...the chemicals that get
released from hormones.

1530
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,647
Hey, so what about the
feelings you have for Riya?

1531
01:26:54,809 --> 01:26:55,651
They too come from hormones, right?

1532
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:58,886
No, Riya is my future.
A very Practical choice.

1533
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,651
There is a formula call SWOT in MBA.

1534
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:02,726
Strength, weakness, opportunity, threat.

1535
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:05,455
Whatever decision I take,
I check my score using the formula.

1536
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:07,361
Do you know my score with Riya?

1537
01:27:07,522 --> 01:27:09,559
- How much?
- 98 percent.

1538
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:10,395
Superb, isn't it?

1539
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:14,131
- Wow... how romantic!
- Thank you.

1540
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:16,502
SWOT this!

1541
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:18,777
She's a mad girl, sir.

1542
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:23,911
See that mountain.

1543
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:25,608
- Is it Doodh Kashi?
- No! No!

1544
01:27:25,773 --> 01:27:27,616
Behind that mountain.

1545
01:27:27,775 --> 01:27:30,085
- Further away.
- ls Doodh Kashi there?

1546
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,953
No! No! No! There is a lake.

1547
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:35,253
Does he know anything?
Cant believe we trusted him!

1548
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:37,794
No! No! You don't know.

1549
01:27:37,952 --> 01:27:38,794
Last year...

1550
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:42,432
...from south India, a man...

1551
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:44,704
...l took to Babaji.

1552
01:27:44,892 --> 01:27:46,769
- Want to see his photographs?
- Yes.

1553
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,333
Raj n I kant?

1554
01:27:49,631 --> 01:27:50,473
Show me! Show me!

1555
01:27:50,632 --> 01:27:52,805
Didn't I say he is lying?
It is photoshopped.

1556
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:54,537
You think I am stupid?

1557
01:27:57,872 --> 01:28:01,285
- Why did you stop?
- You go, I am coming.

1558
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:02,284
<i>QKZV -</i>

1559
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:08,784
- Come.
- There is no signal here.

1560
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:11,559
Tell me the truth.
You are afraid of water, right?

1561
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:13,357
You mind your own business, I will come.

1562
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:19,167
My Phone! My phone fell down!

1563
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,668
Subbu! Subbu, chill.

1564
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:23,365
- Why don't you jump and take it?
- What jump? I am afraid of water.

1565
01:28:24,198 --> 01:28:25,802
My phone... it is lost.

1566
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:28,174
I-phone... 5S... 64 GB.

1567
01:28:28,336 --> 01:28:30,976
Lost! Lost!

1568
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:35,654
Actually it's a good thing, Subbu.

1569
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:38,313
Do you know how much
time we have without a phone?

1570
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:39,822
To do whatl?

1571
01:28:40,682 --> 01:28:42,059
See this.

1572
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:44,724
Such a beautiful place around us.

1573
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,322
What is thisl?

1574
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:50,332
- Subbu, momos are--
- I don't want.

1575
01:28:50,491 --> 01:28:51,595
Leave me like this.

1576
01:28:53,227 --> 01:28:54,171
Be like that.

1577
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:01,578
" Hi!
" Hi!

1578
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:02,510
Where is the toilet?

1579
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,081
Outside.

1580
01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:07,346
Your place is very peaceful, calm.

1581
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,681
I like it.

1582
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:11,551
Oh, yes. Thank you.

1583
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:13,852
Yesterday one tiger attacked.

1584
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:16,120
And killed a small yak.

1585
01:29:17,952 --> 01:29:20,523
Oh! You said you need to
go to the toilet, right?

1586
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:21,860
I don't need to now.

1587
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:23,266
Do you have a problem?

1588
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:26,536
Hey, what is the name of the tiger?

1589
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:30,641
Tiger ate a small yak!

1590
01:29:31,733 --> 01:29:33,542
She said as if it ate momos.

1591
01:29:38,573 --> 01:29:39,313
Subbu.

1592
01:29:42,276 --> 01:29:44,085
Subbu, come out.

1593
01:29:44,245 --> 01:29:45,747
My head stopped beating.
Don't ever do it again.

1594
01:29:45,913 --> 01:29:47,722
It's so beautiful outside...
Come!

1595
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:49,589
Tiger is also there outside.
I will not come.

1596
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,224
Tiger ate a yak yesterday, right?

1597
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,458
So it will not be hungry.

1598
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:55,999
Did it tell you?

1599
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:59,398
It is true, the villagers drove it away.
Come.

1600
01:30:00,995 --> 01:30:04,568
They say dead people
become stars in the sky.

1601
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:06,934
- Who said it?
- Granny.

1602
01:30:07,602 --> 01:30:09,775
Do you think Rishi too became star?

1603
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:12,781
Hey!

1604
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:16,853
See! See! Over there!

1605
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:27,794
Why does God take away
people like Rishi so soon?

1606
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:34,368
Subbu.

1607
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:36,940
Is this you?

1608
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:39,033
Long back.

1609
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,611
So who is this?

1610
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:42,844
Divya.

1611
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:44,972
His first love.

1612
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:47,341
He would enter the
class and sing DDLJ songs.

1613
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:49,883
Bollywood romance. Full drama.

1614
01:30:50,478 --> 01:30:52,458
Oh, what happened after that?

1615
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:54,388
What else?

1616
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:58,328
First love, school love...
they don't work out.

1617
01:30:58,486 --> 01:30:59,658
They don't mean anything.

1618
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:04,495
He had her photo till the end,

1619
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:06,297
...l am sure it meant something.

1620
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:15,308
- Hey.
You said it is not hungry.

1621
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:32,491
Hey, what should I send
to granny.

1622
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:33,324
Whatever.

1623
01:31:34,589 --> 01:31:35,897
Don't you have anybody to send to?

1624
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:38,829
Give one costly card.

1625
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,498
All are the same price.

1626
01:31:41,295 --> 01:31:43,901
Actually granny would like this.

1627
01:31:49,103 --> 01:31:50,241
Hi, Riya.

1628
01:31:52,039 --> 01:31:56,681
Can't wait to be back.

1629
01:31:57,645 --> 01:31:58,715
Riya my future.

1630
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:10,626
- Where did you come from?
- Hyderabad. Telugu! Telugu!

1631
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:14,739
Oh, power star! Pawan Kalyan!!

1632
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:16,807
Yes... yes.

1633
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:19,808
- Trekking on road.
- Yes, trekking.

1634
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:21,947
You can take helicopter, right? Fly.

1635
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:23,605
Helicopter?

1636
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:25,079
Hey!

1637
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,784
Nandi! Nandi!
You too come, I will take a photo.

1638
01:32:30,945 --> 01:32:32,151
Good news! Good news!

1639
01:32:32,313 --> 01:32:33,587
Is it? Which month?

1640
01:32:33,748 --> 01:32:35,819
Ugh! Not that.
There is helicopter to Everest.

1641
01:32:35,983 --> 01:32:38,725
No need to carry the bags
and hear his nuisance. Let us go.

1642
01:32:39,787 --> 01:32:40,959
No helicopter.

1643
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:43,631
Don't think of money.

1644
01:32:43,791 --> 01:32:45,065
- I will manage it.
- Anandi!

1645
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:45,795
Nandi!

1646
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,564
- Where are you going?
- Nandi! Nandi!

1647
01:32:49,463 --> 01:32:50,305
I am not saying we will go back...

1648
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:52,809
...l am saying we will go directly
instead of climbing these mountains.

1649
01:32:52,967 --> 01:32:54,412
Lot of time will be saved.

1650
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:00,248
You don't get it, do you??

1651
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,445
Had Rishi been here,
he wouldn't have taken a shod cut.

1652
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:05,113
To reach Tirumala we don't have to climb steps,
we can go by car too.

1653
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:07,486
But we feel satisfied only
if we climb steps for Tirumala.

1654
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:10,788
Okay... okay... your wish.

1655
01:33:11,953 --> 01:33:13,023
Give it once.

1656
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:19,396
- Now tell me. Will you come or not?
- Subbu, give it.

1657
01:33:19,527 --> 01:33:20,597
- Give it. Please.
- You said we will go...

1658
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:21,762
...we came till here.
- Give it.

1659
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:23,602
- Please don't play.
- Subbu, it is--

1660
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:25,266
How can you set
conditions for everything?

1661
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:26,036
No! Subbu, give it.

1662
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,278
Give I say. Please.

1663
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:28,709
- Should I give?
Give it to me.

1664
01:33:28,869 --> 01:33:30,780
I will never give. I will give only
if you say we will go by helicopter.

1665
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:33,111
Subbu, please give it.

1666
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:33,876
Don't play!

1667
01:33:34,976 --> 01:33:36,046
Subbu, please stop!

1668
01:33:36,877 --> 01:33:37,878
Subbu!

1669
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:43,885
I will not stop!

1670
01:33:45,987 --> 01:33:46,988
I will not stop!

1671
01:33:57,999 --> 01:33:58,909
Anandi!

1672
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:04,009
Anandi!

1673
01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:06,014
Anandi!

1674
01:34:13,214 --> 01:34:13,988
Anandi!

1675
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:20,262
Nandi!

1676
01:34:35,202 --> 01:34:36,408
I am dead!

1677
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:40,444
Hey! Gone! 22,000 Rupees!

1678
01:34:40,574 --> 01:34:41,348
Gone!

1679
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:43,413
Help!

1680
01:34:45,379 --> 01:34:46,619
God, save me!

1681
01:34:47,581 --> 01:34:49,185
If you save me, In the temple at home...

1682
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:51,090
...l will give food for 50 people.

1683
01:34:53,454 --> 01:34:54,524
100 people?

1684
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:58,065
HaPPV7

1685
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:02,871
I'll find out who I am,
ifl go to Doodh Kashi?

1686
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:04,699
I am coming, wait.

1687
01:35:05,132 --> 01:35:06,304
You wait there.

1688
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:13,447
Hey, come on.

1689
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:29,932
Who am I?

1690
01:35:30,825 --> 01:35:33,237
The teachings of
Bhagwan Ramana Maharshi.

1691
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:45,444
Hey...

1692
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:48,819
...is this your wife?

1693
01:35:51,345 --> 01:35:52,289
Yes.

1694
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:54,022
She is Mary.

1695
01:35:55,116 --> 01:35:56,026
My wife.

1696
01:35:56,984 --> 01:35:59,191
My business partner. My everything.

1697
01:35:59,653 --> 01:36:02,190
Business partner. nice...

1698
01:36:02,356 --> 01:36:03,767
So, what do you guys do?

1699
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:06,036
Bluetooth technologies.

1700
01:36:06,193 --> 01:36:08,935
Bluetooth technologies...
Oh, I know it. You work there?

1701
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:11,766
No... no... that is my company.

1702
01:36:14,702 --> 01:36:18,479
What?!! But that's a Multi-million
dollar company.

1703
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:20,141
Its listed on Wall street too.

1704
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:22,947
I mean what you guys doing here?

1705
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:26,888
I started the company when I was young.

1706
01:36:27,047 --> 01:36:29,152
I was hungry. I wanted to be first.
it was a race!

1707
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:34,292
I told Mary at that time that
I will retire at the age of 40...

1708
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:37,402
...and will show
her the entire world...

1709
01:36:38,092 --> 01:36:39,628
...and enjoy life.

1710
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:42,065
We reached 40.

1711
01:36:43,164 --> 01:36:46,509
There were so many clients and sources
to earn more money at that time.

1712
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:48,738
Of course, we couldn't stop now.

1713
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:52,080
So, we reached 50.

1714
01:36:53,574 --> 01:36:57,021
I thought of extending
retirement by another five years.

1715
01:36:58,913 --> 01:37:02,417
Actually I too don't
become satisfied easily.

1716
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:05,093
So you and your wife...

1717
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:09,723
...decided to visit the entire
world after retiring.

1718
01:37:09,924 --> 01:37:11,733
So you guys are on a trip together.

1719
01:37:12,059 --> 01:37:14,039
Mary died last year.

1720
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:15,133
What?

1721
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:17,904
I had time, so many, many years...

1722
01:37:18,065 --> 01:37:19,669
...to go anywhere with her.

1723
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,336
But I postponed it.

1724
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:23,175
Funny thing is...

1725
01:37:23,337 --> 01:37:26,580
...the work for which I
postponed my personal life...

1726
01:37:26,707 --> 01:37:28,744
...l don't even remember what it was...

1727
01:37:29,076 --> 01:37:30,578
...except Mary.

1728
01:37:45,626 --> 01:37:48,698
- He is missing since last evening.
- Don't panic, Anandi.

1729
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:50,706
Hey, your friend.

1730
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:59,648
You know one thing? Real success <i>is</i>
finding someone who cares for you.

1731
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:00,714
Don't panic.

1732
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:03,253
- People are searching. Don't worry.
- Just go.

1733
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:43,618
Why did you get so worried?

1734
01:38:43,784 --> 01:38:44,762
I was frightened.

1735
01:38:45,519 --> 01:38:46,657
About me?

1736
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:48,823
About Rishi!

1737
01:39:15,482 --> 01:39:17,462
Hey, what happened to your glasses?

1738
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:19,161
They are lost.

1739
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:21,560
Are you able to see?

1740
01:39:24,058 --> 01:39:25,230
Actually, I don't have sight.

1741
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:26,700
What?

1742
01:39:28,329 --> 01:39:31,401
It's just that...l calculated that

1743
01:39:31,565 --> 01:39:36,036
8 percent people will take you more seriously
if you have glasses, so I started wearing them.

1744
01:39:36,637 --> 01:39:37,707
Oh my God!

1745
01:42:00,647 --> 01:42:01,318
Hey!

1746
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:05,859
Here... here?

1747
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:09,627
Lost.

1748
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:13,130
Come.

1749
01:42:13,494 --> 01:42:14,234
- Oh... yes.
- This is the way!

1750
01:42:14,394 --> 01:42:15,338
- Okay.
- This way?

1751
01:42:16,396 --> 01:42:17,500
Hey, fool!

1752
01:42:19,633 --> 01:42:20,509
Where to go?

1753
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:22,041
See the map.

1754
01:42:24,605 --> 01:42:25,515
Nice map!

1755
01:42:26,707 --> 01:42:29,187
- Where to go from here?
There is one tree.

1756
01:42:29,343 --> 01:42:30,253
From there, take right.

1757
01:42:32,713 --> 01:42:34,192
Where that tree gone.

1758
01:42:34,348 --> 01:42:35,418
One tree??

1759
01:42:35,883 --> 01:42:38,762
Oh, yes. I got an idea.
Near my village.

1760
01:42:39,019 --> 01:42:40,896
There is a Baba, who might know the path.

1761
01:42:41,021 --> 01:42:42,694
- Come along with me. Come on.
- Okay.

1762
01:42:43,524 --> 01:42:45,902
This is last village
before Doodh Kashi?

1763
01:42:48,962 --> 01:42:50,669
My mamma is great.

1764
01:42:51,598 --> 01:42:54,579
She is the best cook
in the whole village.

1765
01:42:54,735 --> 01:42:55,577
Thank God!

1766
01:42:55,736 --> 01:42:59,013
We will eat something special at least
today, bored of eating momo daily.

1767
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:04,022
- Crap!
- Eat, eat, very nice.

1768
01:43:05,812 --> 01:43:07,450
Best momo in the whole world.

1769
01:43:15,422 --> 01:43:16,696
Who is this sitting inside the tree?

1770
01:43:17,424 --> 01:43:18,368
Who is this sitting inside the tree?

1771
01:43:18,759 --> 01:43:19,703
Where do we go from here?

1772
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:20,770
Baba will tell.

1773
01:43:20,928 --> 01:43:21,804
Then ask him...

1774
01:43:22,729 --> 01:43:23,867
Baba doesn't talk.

1775
01:43:24,698 --> 01:43:26,609
So how will a dumb Baba
tell the directions?

1776
01:43:31,205 --> 01:43:31,808
Baba.

1777
01:43:33,774 --> 01:43:35,549
We have come a very long way.

1778
01:43:35,709 --> 01:43:37,950
Our friend Rishi's last wish.

1779
01:43:38,946 --> 01:43:40,118
Was to go to Doodh Kashi.

1780
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:43,858
You have to show the way. Please.

1781
01:44:03,804 --> 01:44:05,511
Take... take.

1782
01:44:08,342 --> 01:44:09,912
What is this?

1783
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:12,114
Holy Baba's offering.

1784
01:44:12,312 --> 01:44:15,316
Eat... eat...
it will give all the answer, 1, 2, 3.

1785
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:35,440
This is not just any offering.

1786
01:45:26,753 --> 01:45:28,357
I love my mother.

1787
01:45:28,522 --> 01:45:30,502
I will never leave her again.

1788
01:45:41,868 --> 01:45:43,939
Subbu... okay?

1789
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:48,278
Actually super okay.

1790
01:45:51,878 --> 01:45:53,949
For completing the
deal of Ramaiah Company...

1791
01:45:54,448 --> 01:45:56,621
...l tried a lot to escape from coming here.

1792
01:46:03,557 --> 01:46:04,797
Actually I want to tell you something.

1793
01:46:08,628 --> 01:46:09,265
Thank you...

1794
01:46:10,597 --> 01:46:11,974
...for bringing me here.

1795
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:15,737
Actually you should
thank Rishi...not me.

1796
01:46:19,673 --> 01:46:20,708
Thank you, Rishi.

1797
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:25,049
Subbu...

1798
01:46:36,857 --> 01:46:37,665
Subbu, be careful.

1799
01:46:42,562 --> 01:46:43,506
Subbu!

1800
01:47:20,267 --> 01:47:22,338
You died right?

1801
01:47:24,304 --> 01:47:25,339
Dead?

1802
01:47:26,306 --> 01:47:30,186
The Old Subbu wouldn't have jumped had I fallen
into a river. Now see, he jumped just for the bottle.

1803
01:47:32,045 --> 01:47:33,888
He was very practical in childhood.

1804
01:47:34,147 --> 01:47:35,353
What's happened to him now?

1805
01:47:35,982 --> 01:47:39,361
He even put a towel on his car seat
so that my blood won't stain it.

1806
01:47:40,754 --> 01:47:42,062
- He is very practical.
- Hey, Subbu.

1807
01:47:44,057 --> 01:47:45,331
I didn't say bye to you, right?

1808
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:52,303
This girl?... How is my mistake?

1809
01:47:53,233 --> 01:47:56,373
- What did we do?
- True.

1810
01:47:56,570 --> 01:47:58,345
We didn't do anyihing.

1811
01:47:58,572 --> 01:48:00,552
Iam saying, Do something.

1812
01:48:00,707 --> 01:48:01,651
I didn't understand.

1813
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:03,113
Hello.

1814
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:06,889
I understood.

1815
01:48:30,403 --> 01:48:31,279
Greetings.

1816
01:48:32,005 --> 01:48:33,006
How is the hand?

1817
01:48:33,874 --> 01:48:37,048
I found you last night by the river.

1818
01:48:37,377 --> 01:48:39,254
You are very lucky.

1819
01:48:58,798 --> 01:48:59,640
Hey!

1820
01:49:06,806 --> 01:49:08,615
This is my garden's cabbage.

1821
01:49:10,076 --> 01:49:10,952
What should I do?

1822
01:49:12,178 --> 01:49:14,715
Keep it in kitchen.
I will come and make soup.

1823
01:49:36,102 --> 01:49:36,773
Help!

1824
01:49:41,575 --> 01:49:42,315
Come.

1825
01:49:43,577 --> 01:49:44,248
Come.

1826
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:50,121
Anybody there?

1827
01:49:52,252 --> 01:49:53,822
Help! One girl.

1828
01:49:53,987 --> 01:49:56,433
No! No! I don't know.

1829
01:49:57,958 --> 01:49:58,459
Help!

1830
01:50:01,962 --> 01:50:02,497
Help!

1831
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:04,674
One girl.

1832
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:13,949
You go outside.

1833
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:24,357
How is she?

1834
01:50:28,121 --> 01:50:28,826
Something--

1835
01:50:29,823 --> 01:50:30,528
What happened?

1836
01:50:41,167 --> 01:50:41,838
Yes!

1837
01:50:43,136 --> 01:50:44,240
True, We didn't do anyihing.

1838
01:50:45,271 --> 01:50:46,807
Iam saying, Do something.

1839
01:51:56,509 --> 01:51:57,317
Sorry, Rishi.

1840
01:51:58,812 --> 01:51:59,722
It was a Mistake.

1841
01:52:01,081 --> 01:52:02,082
You were correct.

1842
01:53:02,375 --> 01:53:03,945
Subbu! Thank God.

1843
01:53:16,990 --> 01:53:19,561
Mamma, here is your medicine.

1844
01:53:20,693 --> 01:53:21,296
Drink.

1845
01:53:21,928 --> 01:53:23,339
Your fever will go.

1846
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,473
Keep this money, you will need it.

1847
01:53:28,635 --> 01:53:30,581
- We will go from here.
- No! No!

1848
01:53:30,703 --> 01:53:32,478
I do not deserve this money.

1849
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:35,313
I am sorry,
I failed to take you to Doodh Kashi.

1850
01:53:35,475 --> 01:53:38,581
You should stay with your mother,
we will somehow manage.

1851
01:53:38,978 --> 01:53:41,219
You brought us so far, thank you.

1852
01:53:41,381 --> 01:53:43,258
Bad weather there, you can't go.

1853
01:53:43,416 --> 01:53:45,453
We will go if we are destined.
It is okay.

1854
01:53:46,419 --> 01:53:47,557
You keep this money.

1855
01:53:50,023 --> 01:53:51,468
You are good funny fellow.

1856
01:53:54,027 --> 01:53:55,005
Shake now!

1857
01:53:57,697 --> 01:53:58,732
Funny fellow.

1858
01:54:02,235 --> 01:54:04,841
All the best. Come... come, Anandi!

1859
01:54:05,038 --> 01:54:06,608
- Pemba.
- Remember those directions...

1860
01:54:06,739 --> 01:54:07,581
...which I have shown you.

1861
01:54:07,707 --> 01:54:08,742
" Okay?
" Okay,

1862
01:54:09,676 --> 01:54:12,623
Mother, bless them.
They are going to very dangerous area.

1863
01:55:56,449 --> 01:55:57,689
Let us go back, come.

1864
01:56:00,186 --> 01:56:03,463
Subbu, can't you seei?
My fate is like this.

1865
01:56:03,890 --> 01:56:07,963
Something bad always happens to the people
close to me. I am bad luck. Jinx.

1866
01:56:09,395 --> 01:56:11,807
If something happens to
you then I cannot bear it.

1867
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:15,272
I can't take a chance. Come. Come.

1868
01:56:15,435 --> 01:56:16,880
- Let us go back.
- Rishi...

1869
01:56:20,907 --> 01:56:22,580
...didn't reach Doodh Kashi yet.

1870
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:23,977
How can we go back now?

1871
01:57:01,881 --> 01:57:03,883
The second time I broke my hand
because of Rishi.

1872
01:58:06,279 --> 01:58:06,950
Come.

1873
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:11,355
We are very close.

1874
01:58:14,287 --> 01:58:14,992
Nandi!

1875
01:58:16,189 --> 01:58:16,997
Nandi!

1876
01:58:18,157 --> 01:58:18,828
Nandi!

1877
01:58:22,095 --> 01:58:22,766
Nandi!

1878
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:24,501
What happened?

1879
01:58:26,666 --> 01:58:29,272
Subbu, I am unable to feel my fingers.

1880
01:58:29,435 --> 01:58:30,175
Get up.

1881
01:58:31,104 --> 01:58:31,775
Come.

1882
01:58:52,225 --> 01:58:52,999
Sit.

1883
01:58:58,431 --> 01:58:59,136
Hey!

1884
01:59:20,753 --> 01:59:24,223
Sorry, Subbu.
All this happened because of me.

1885
01:59:24,390 --> 01:59:26,165
Quiet! If not for you...

1886
01:59:26,325 --> 01:59:29,431
I wouldn't have come so far for my friend
...my best friend Rishi.

1887
01:59:30,029 --> 01:59:32,009
I don't know how to repay your favour.

1888
01:59:32,798 --> 01:59:35,438
No... I am a mad girl.

1889
01:59:36,769 --> 01:59:37,839
That is also correct.

1890
01:59:38,204 --> 01:59:41,014
But actually you don't
know how cool you are.

1891
01:59:42,341 --> 01:59:43,513
You are special, Nandi.

1892
01:59:47,914 --> 01:59:48,585
Nandi.

1893
01:59:51,751 --> 01:59:52,456
Slept?

1894
02:00:04,530 --> 02:00:05,372
Really slept.

1895
02:00:21,814 --> 02:00:22,485
Nandi!

1896
02:00:23,583 --> 02:00:24,425
Nandi!

1897
02:00:25,218 --> 02:00:25,855
Nandi!

1898
02:00:27,553 --> 02:00:29,624
Hello, Subramaniyam.

1899
02:00:31,224 --> 02:00:32,965
See what I found.

1900
02:00:33,993 --> 02:00:34,733
When did you wake up?

1901
02:00:34,894 --> 02:00:38,740
Long back...
The bedrooms on top, dining room below.

1902
02:00:38,898 --> 02:00:40,309
How cute it is!

1903
02:00:40,833 --> 02:00:44,144
Oh really? Wait, I will
go and see the weather situation outside.

1904
02:00:46,839 --> 02:00:47,613
Hey!

1905
02:00:52,578 --> 02:00:54,683
- How is it?
- Still too cold.

1906
02:00:56,582 --> 02:00:59,256
I never thought much
of my dream house.

1907
02:00:59,452 --> 02:01:02,456
But really, where can I find
a more perfect house than this.

1908
02:01:03,422 --> 02:01:04,423
What about food?

1909
02:01:08,628 --> 02:01:09,766
Hold for a moment!

1910
02:01:11,264 --> 02:01:13,540
A Bag full of potatoes.

1911
02:01:13,966 --> 02:01:15,036
See no problem.

1912
02:01:15,201 --> 02:01:19,115
What do we really need in life?
Food, clothes and shelter.

1913
02:01:19,272 --> 02:01:21,115
- Subbu, we have everything.
- Potato!

1914
02:01:23,876 --> 02:01:25,116
Wonder whose house this is?

1915
02:01:25,745 --> 02:01:27,782
Wonder how old are these potatoes?
Don't know if we can eat them or not.

1916
02:01:27,947 --> 02:01:29,483
Do you know what
granny always says?

1917
02:01:29,949 --> 02:01:32,896
Every grain of food has the name ofthe
person who is destined to eat it.

1918
02:01:33,152 --> 02:01:36,133
Wonder how many
days these potatoes waited for us.

1919
02:01:36,889 --> 02:01:38,129
We shouldn't make them wait anymore.

1920
02:01:39,292 --> 02:01:40,794
Now, chef's special.

1921
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:43,566
- What is this?
- Subbu, Rishi, Anandi.

1922
02:01:43,863 --> 02:01:44,568
One minute.

1923
02:01:46,232 --> 02:01:47,370
Sit here, Rishi.

1924
02:01:49,435 --> 02:01:51,039
Eat this, where is mine?

1925
02:01:54,106 --> 02:01:56,814
Now potato soup.

1926
02:01:57,176 --> 02:01:59,178
I never knew one can cook
so many varieties with potatoes.

1927
02:01:59,345 --> 02:02:02,189
- Hey, do you know to make chips?
- Do you want ketchup also?

1928
02:02:02,315 --> 02:02:03,055
Eat first.

1929
02:02:13,225 --> 02:02:15,262
- What is this?
- Horse.

1930
02:02:16,195 --> 02:02:17,333
It looks like a dog.

1931
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:38,960
Happy Diwali.

1932
02:02:42,355 --> 02:02:45,893
You made them from potatoes...
superb idea.

1933
02:03:11,917 --> 02:03:12,588
Subbu.

1934
02:03:13,386 --> 02:03:13,989
Subbu.

1935
02:03:15,955 --> 02:03:16,990
Are you sleeping?

1936
02:03:18,491 --> 02:03:19,765
Say yes if you're sleeping.

1937
02:03:22,428 --> 02:03:24,772
Do you know how happy
I was in these few days?

1938
02:03:26,198 --> 02:03:28,906
For the first time I felt
there is someone for me in life.

1939
02:03:29,935 --> 02:03:31,915
Subbu, listen.

1940
02:03:35,074 --> 02:03:36,018
I love you.

1941
02:03:37,977 --> 02:03:41,447
Hey, I love you means not that
like you. I love you means, I love you.

1942
02:04:04,937 --> 02:04:05,711
Nandi!

1943
02:04:06,972 --> 02:04:08,815
Nandi, what is that bag?

1944
02:04:09,742 --> 02:04:11,187
For how many days are
we going to stay here?

1945
02:04:11,811 --> 02:04:12,846
It is cleared outside.

1946
02:04:14,647 --> 02:04:15,523
Nandi!

1947
02:04:22,788 --> 02:04:24,995
Nandi! Nandi!

1948
02:04:28,727 --> 02:04:30,365
- What is all this?
- Your shares?

1949
02:04:30,563 --> 02:04:31,871
- Why now--
- So when?

1950
02:04:32,031 --> 02:04:33,908
I said I will give if you come.
That was the deal.

1951
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:38,148
- Why are you talking about deals now?
- Subbu, I know your life is different.

1952
02:04:38,304 --> 02:04:40,215
I also you know are engaged.

1953
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:44,246
Sometimes I just don't think.

1954
02:04:45,044 --> 02:04:46,216
I am mad, remember.

1955
02:04:46,345 --> 02:04:48,256
- I didn't say it like that.
- Subbu, it is okay.

1956
02:04:48,380 --> 02:04:52,385
We came for Rishi.
Come, we still have to go to Doodh Kashi.

1957
02:07:17,563 --> 02:07:18,701
I think we are close.

1958
02:07:25,838 --> 02:07:29,809
Subbu, these stones are the same way
the Baba in the tree put them!

1959
02:08:05,010 --> 02:08:07,286
Subbu! Subbu!

1960
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:08,420
Come here.

1961
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:15,123
Subbu!

1962
02:08:17,322 --> 02:08:18,562
Where are you, Subbu?

1963
02:08:22,494 --> 02:08:23,097
Anandi.

1964
02:08:24,296 --> 02:08:24,899
Come here.

1965
02:08:26,065 --> 02:08:26,873
Ouch!

1966
02:08:31,537 --> 02:08:32,607
Come... come.

1967
02:09:00,099 --> 02:09:01,134
- Subbu!
- Anandi.

1968
02:09:01,934 --> 02:09:02,912
What is this?

1969
02:09:03,168 --> 02:09:04,909
Rishi... Doodh Kashi.

1970
02:09:05,070 --> 02:09:05,673
Doodh Kashi.

1971
02:09:08,140 --> 02:09:09,244
He made it.

1972
02:09:09,908 --> 02:09:11,182
Finally he achieved it.

1973
02:09:12,444 --> 02:09:15,118
- So beautiful.
- Come.

1974
02:09:20,419 --> 02:09:21,124
We have reached.

1975
02:12:27,806 --> 02:12:28,477
- Congrats, sir.
- Thank you.

1976
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:30,449
Sir, I knew you will do, I knew it.

1977
02:12:30,609 --> 02:12:31,485
You did it, sir.

1978
02:12:31,677 --> 02:12:34,317
You need to earn the right
to sit in this chair.

1979
02:12:34,479 --> 02:12:37,119
Subbu has earned it today.

1980
02:12:37,549 --> 02:12:41,053
Subbu, I knew you would win.
I always believed in you.

1981
02:12:43,055 --> 02:12:45,467
Come on, boy. Come, sit.

1982
02:12:51,029 --> 02:12:52,804
Subbu is our company's future.

1983
02:12:53,665 --> 02:12:55,576
He will take it to
a higher level than me.

1984
02:13:07,846 --> 02:13:10,486
Congrats, sir.
So good to have you, sir.

1985
02:13:11,249 --> 02:13:12,853
Sir, Ramaiah Company.

1986
02:13:13,318 --> 02:13:14,991
Pashupathi sir told me...

1987
02:13:15,153 --> 02:13:16,826
...to take the responsibility
of the takeover.

1988
02:13:16,989 --> 02:13:18,491
If you forward your
share papers to me...

1989
02:13:18,657 --> 02:13:21,103
...then that old man
will have to leave empty handed...

1990
02:13:21,259 --> 02:13:22,397
meveryihing by day after tomorrow.

1991
02:13:29,001 --> 02:13:31,072
Quality is good.
Polish the grain a bit less.

1992
02:13:31,236 --> 02:13:32,943
- Okay.
- You said It's not for sale.

1993
02:13:34,439 --> 02:13:37,113
Finished. It is done.

1994
02:13:38,276 --> 02:13:41,416
Their trust and respect on you...
everything.

1995
02:13:41,747 --> 02:13:42,555
Everything is finished.

1996
02:13:43,281 --> 02:13:45,887
This company will not be
in your name in another two days.

1997
02:13:46,184 --> 02:13:48,357
Had you listened to me then at
least something would have remained.

1998
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:51,533
Come. We will sit and talk.

1999
02:13:52,624 --> 02:13:54,069
You said something at that time.

2000
02:13:54,226 --> 02:13:56,206
That you will do this work,
no matter what?!

2001
02:13:56,561 --> 02:13:58,632
This company will shut
down in another two days.

2002
02:13:59,097 --> 02:14:00,735
Why are you still doing it, sir?
Go home and take rest.

2003
02:14:00,899 --> 02:14:01,673
Sit.

2004
02:14:02,401 --> 02:14:03,243
Sit!

2005
02:14:05,704 --> 02:14:07,479
You used to have spectacles, right?

2006
02:14:07,706 --> 02:14:08,776
Specs are--

2007
02:14:09,074 --> 02:14:11,953
ls that your problem now? You have
worked hard to set up this company.

2008
02:14:12,444 --> 02:14:14,924
You fought and saved it,
someone is snatching it away...

2009
02:14:15,113 --> 02:14:17,957
...don't you feel sad.
Aren't you getting angry with me?

2010
02:14:19,651 --> 02:14:20,959
You know the Bhagavad-Gita?

2011
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:23,156
Let me tell you my favorite verse.

2012
02:14:30,595 --> 02:14:32,074
Do you know its meaning?

2013
02:14:32,798 --> 02:14:34,800
Man shouldn't work for expectations...

2014
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:37,405
...he should simply do his duty.

2015
02:14:38,537 --> 02:14:40,517
Whatever has to happen will happen.

2016
02:14:43,675 --> 02:14:45,518
Sir, why do you tell lines
from Bhagavad-Gita...

2017
02:14:45,677 --> 02:14:47,588
...when you are losing
your entire life's work?

2018
02:14:49,247 --> 02:14:51,158
You talked about being selfish.

2019
02:14:51,316 --> 02:14:53,990
Now, selfish people like Subramaniyam
and Pashupathi are winning.

2020
02:14:54,753 --> 02:14:56,926
So why has the Subramaniyam who won...

2021
02:14:57,389 --> 02:14:59,926
...come to this Ramaiah who has lost...

2022
02:15:00,659 --> 02:15:02,161
...why did he come to him?

2023
02:15:08,533 --> 02:15:09,273
Isn't it?

2024
02:15:10,535 --> 02:15:12,947
Correct. Why did I come?

2025
02:15:13,605 --> 02:15:16,449
Let anything happen to you
and your workers, why should I care?

2026
02:15:16,808 --> 02:15:19,311
Is he still working in that company?

2027
02:15:19,678 --> 02:15:22,955
- Who?
- The one who came last time.

2028
02:15:23,115 --> 02:15:23,991
Subramaniyam.

2029
02:15:25,584 --> 02:15:27,723
Ask him a question if you meet him.

2030
02:15:28,019 --> 02:15:29,657
Ask his conscience.

2031
02:15:31,656 --> 02:15:35,035
Ask who Subramaniyam is.

2032
02:15:35,794 --> 02:15:39,469
Okay, so nowadays this theme is popular...

2033
02:15:39,631 --> 02:15:42,805
...but I would suggest to you is...

2034
02:15:42,968 --> 02:15:43,776
"some good...

2035
02:15:43,935 --> 02:15:46,472
...so I will get a designer...

2036
02:15:46,638 --> 02:15:49,414
...who will recreate the atmosphere
ofthe pantheon...

2037
02:15:49,574 --> 02:15:50,575
...and it is amazing.

2038
02:16:03,355 --> 02:16:05,164
And the water sewed at the wedding...

2039
02:16:05,323 --> 02:16:07,667
...will be exclusively
imported from the Himalayas--

2040
02:16:07,826 --> 02:16:09,635
Wow! Did you hear that, Subbu?

2041
02:16:09,794 --> 02:16:11,330
Isn't that a wonderful idea?

2042
02:16:13,765 --> 02:16:14,470
Subbu.

2043
02:16:35,520 --> 02:16:36,521
Sorry.

2044
02:16:38,190 --> 02:16:38,964
Sorry, Riya.

2045
02:16:39,724 --> 02:16:40,794
I not correct for you.

2046
02:16:41,626 --> 02:16:43,799
This marriage is not taking place,
it is cancelled. You may go.

2047
02:16:44,963 --> 02:16:46,738
Subbu, are you joking?

2048
02:16:47,899 --> 02:16:49,845
No, Riya. I am not joking.

2049
02:16:50,068 --> 02:16:51,069
I am very serious.

2050
02:16:52,404 --> 02:16:53,405
I lived in a pent house till recently.

2051
02:16:53,572 --> 02:16:55,051
I wanted to reach the level of
Casa Paradise...

2052
02:16:55,207 --> 02:16:57,050
...now I reached here.
Next New York. After that?

2053
02:16:59,277 --> 02:17:00,620
I met a person called Robert

2054
02:17:00,779 --> 02:17:03,817
When I remember his words
and look back into my life once...

2055
02:17:04,316 --> 02:17:07,058
...l don't see these buildings,
cars and money I've earned.

2056
02:17:09,988 --> 02:17:11,729
Do you know what I am seeing?
I can see the face of a...

2057
02:17:11,890 --> 02:17:14,564
...a new born girl who
I held in my hands in the Himalayas.

2058
02:17:16,494 --> 02:17:17,404
Who needs anyihing else?

2059
02:17:18,096 --> 02:17:21,771
Subbu, did you get enlightened
after going to the Himalayas?

2060
02:17:23,702 --> 02:17:24,772
Yes in a way.

2061
02:17:26,037 --> 02:17:27,448
I had to go till there.

2062
02:17:28,106 --> 02:17:29,244
But there is no need, Riya.

2063
02:17:30,041 --> 02:17:31,145
Truth is truth anywhere.

2064
02:17:32,477 --> 02:17:34,423
Yesterday...
what did you tell me yesterday?

2065
02:17:34,746 --> 02:17:39,525
I asked why you are marrying me,
you said I am a winner, clever.

2066
02:17:41,019 --> 02:17:42,862
But you didn't say you love me.

2067
02:17:44,055 --> 02:17:46,661
How can you say?
Where is the love? Love is not there.

2068
02:17:47,025 --> 02:17:49,027
Once Rishi asked me
to tell our love story.

2069
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:51,299
I too couldn't say it.
It is not there right?

2070
02:17:51,463 --> 02:17:54,137
It is not your mistake in
it because I too thought like that.

2071
02:17:54,332 --> 02:17:55,936
That's why we were a perfect
couple at that time.

2072
02:17:56,101 --> 02:17:56,909
Not now.

2073
02:17:57,269 --> 02:17:59,112
Because the Subramaniyam you liked...

2074
02:17:59,271 --> 02:18:01,046
...l left at Doodh Kashi with Rishi.

2075
02:18:01,606 --> 02:18:02,710
He and I are different.

2076
02:18:03,275 --> 02:18:05,551
Subbu, don't talk rubbish.

2077
02:18:05,877 --> 02:18:06,787
Rubbish?

2078
02:18:07,178 --> 02:18:08,623
Don't you understand? See.

2079
02:18:09,047 --> 02:18:10,321
See you are beautiful, I like you.

2080
02:18:10,482 --> 02:18:12,894
I like you means I like you,
not that I love you.

2081
02:18:13,485 --> 02:18:15,487
Hey, I love you means
not that I like you.

2082
02:18:15,654 --> 02:18:17,031
I love you means I love you.

2083
02:18:19,624 --> 02:18:21,570
Actually I need to leave.

2084
02:18:23,495 --> 02:18:25,668
I wrote this card for you,
it arrived bit late.

2085
02:18:27,098 --> 02:18:27,701
Subbu!

2086
02:18:29,301 --> 02:18:30,712
It is over if you exit the door.

2087
02:18:33,738 --> 02:18:36,218
I am serious.
You will not get a second chance.

2088
02:18:37,776 --> 02:18:38,846
This is my second chance!

2089
02:18:41,079 --> 02:18:42,057
Say hi to your dad.

2090
02:18:45,483 --> 02:18:46,518
Actually say bye.

2091
02:18:50,555 --> 02:18:51,499
Don't trust anybody.

2092
02:18:52,223 --> 02:18:55,432
Don't trust friends,
strangers, not parents especially.

2093
02:18:55,627 --> 02:18:56,537
What is this?

2094
02:18:56,828 --> 02:18:58,273
Nobody is permanent.

2095
02:18:59,030 --> 02:19:02,443
Everyone in this world
lives for their own needs.

2096
02:19:04,135 --> 02:19:05,512
We all live a lonely life.

2097
02:19:07,872 --> 02:19:08,509
Like a crow.

2098
02:19:08,673 --> 02:19:13,520
Hey, girl. I thought you will teach Karate
to children. What is this crow rubbish?

2099
02:19:14,145 --> 02:19:15,556
I am teaching them.

2100
02:19:16,414 --> 02:19:18,655
Hey, listen. We should
be ready for everyihing. Okay?

2101
02:19:18,817 --> 02:19:19,887
Attention! Come on!

2102
02:19:20,218 --> 02:19:22,255
Make pairs... face your partner.

2103
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:24,261
Do exactly what I am doing, okay?

2104
02:19:24,556 --> 02:19:28,902
Follow me! I need a volunteer
for demonstration. You?

2105
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:30,471
Sorry, I received a call.

2106
02:19:31,763 --> 02:19:34,369
Hey somebody come.
It is just five minutes. Please come.

2107
02:19:36,201 --> 02:19:37,544
Great! Great! Come.

2108
02:19:52,951 --> 02:19:55,295
If you have come to give me your wedding invitation
then I will break your other hand also.

2109
02:19:55,487 --> 02:19:57,558
- I didn't come for that.
- So why did you come?

2110
02:19:57,722 --> 02:19:59,565
I don't have shares
left with me to give.

2111
02:20:00,258 --> 02:20:01,566
Give me a share in your life,
that is enough.

2112
02:20:03,728 --> 02:20:05,639
- Hand... hand.
- So what happened to Riya?

2113
02:20:05,797 --> 02:20:07,242
Did you forget your MBA formula?

2114
02:20:07,399 --> 02:20:09,140
Strength, weakness, etc.

2115
02:20:09,300 --> 02:20:10,973
Subbu, our score will be zero.

2116
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:12,240
Riya is only correct for you.

2117
02:20:12,404 --> 02:20:14,077
That was then, not now.

2118
02:20:14,239 --> 02:20:16,276
It is not correct to spoil
Riya's life by marrying her.

2119
02:20:16,474 --> 02:20:18,317
So you want to spoil my life?

2120
02:20:19,277 --> 02:20:20,585
That's not what I mean.

2121
02:20:21,045 --> 02:20:22,023
Even though I am living
in a ten crores house...

2122
02:20:22,180 --> 02:20:23,682
...l am thinking of the moments spent
with you in the hut.

2123
02:20:23,848 --> 02:20:25,850
I am ordering for potatoes
even in a five star hotel.

2124
02:20:26,017 --> 02:20:28,497
- What did you understand by that?
- You like potatoes.

2125
02:20:30,422 --> 02:20:32,299
Your face! It means I like you.

2126
02:20:33,691 --> 02:20:36,331
Earlier I had a
calculation for everything.

2127
02:20:37,028 --> 02:20:38,530
Now it feels like its enough ifl have you.

2128
02:20:38,696 --> 02:20:39,936
I really. . .really--

2129
02:20:42,434 --> 02:20:43,037
Wait.

2130
02:20:44,269 --> 02:20:45,111
I love you.

2131
02:20:45,804 --> 02:20:48,045
I love you means I love you,
not that I like you.

2132
02:20:48,273 --> 02:20:49,513
- I really...really--
- Teacher.

2133
02:20:50,074 --> 02:20:51,052
Wait.

2134
02:20:51,609 --> 02:20:52,485
- I really...really--
- Teacher!

2135
02:20:52,644 --> 02:20:53,315
Hold it!

2136
02:20:53,478 --> 02:20:54,957
This is a Matter of life and death.

2137
02:20:55,914 --> 02:20:57,052
Where did we stop just now?

2138
02:21:01,119 --> 02:21:03,065
Rishi once asked me
to tell my love story.

2139
02:21:03,721 --> 02:21:05,064
I didn't have love story at that time.

2140
02:21:05,623 --> 02:21:07,967
Now I have a love story
but Rishi is not there.

2141
02:21:09,027 --> 02:21:11,473
You are my everything now.
This life is yours.

2142
02:21:11,629 --> 02:21:12,972
What if you find
a better girl than me?

2143
02:21:13,331 --> 02:21:15,140
This entire life will be
enough to handle your madness.

2144
02:21:15,300 --> 02:21:16,973
I will not have time
to see another girl.

2145
02:21:17,569 --> 02:21:20,311
If you do, I will pluck out your eyes.

2146
02:21:20,738 --> 02:21:22,479
Done! Done!

2147
02:21:42,260 --> 02:21:43,000
Subbu.

2148
02:21:43,428 --> 02:21:46,341
- You are frightened of ghosts, right?
- Yes, why bring that up now?

2149
02:21:48,366 --> 02:21:50,004
I have to tell you a secret.

2150
02:21:50,835 --> 02:21:53,145
- My father Krishnamuflhy--
- He is no more, right?

2151
02:21:53,738 --> 02:21:56,685
He comes to meet
me daily at mid night.

2152
02:21:58,142 --> 02:22:00,144
Floating in the air... white.

2153
02:22:01,513 --> 02:22:03,186
- One minute... get up.
- What?

2154
02:22:07,418 --> 02:22:09,591
- Whom are you calling?
- Riya. She might cancel the marriage.

2155
02:22:09,754 --> 02:22:11,290
- I should tell her to stop.
- Oh..you will call her!

2156
02:22:11,422 --> 02:22:12,423
You will call only if you have hands.

2157
02:22:12,624 --> 02:22:15,127
- Stand here!
- Hey, I am joking.

2158
02:22:18,196 --> 02:22:19,140
Sir.

2159
02:22:20,164 --> 02:22:21,302
We have received the Shares!

2160
02:22:27,405 --> 02:22:28,383
What is it?

2161
02:22:29,541 --> 02:22:34,547
It is a job application sir.
Subramaniyam.

2162
02:22:36,915 --> 02:22:38,155
How did you get Dada?

2163
02:22:38,316 --> 02:22:41,160
I gave him the car, he gave me Dada.
Exchange offer.

2164
02:22:41,319 --> 02:22:42,764
He is happy, and I am too happy.

2165
02:22:49,594 --> 02:22:53,440
"Jantar Mantar!
Should I perform all magic tricks..."

2166
02:22:53,598 --> 02:22:54,736
"...on you?"

2167
02:22:55,166 --> 02:22:56,406
"Sorrow, grief."

2168
02:22:56,568 --> 02:23:00,448
“Should I convert them into zeros?“

2169
02:23:00,638 --> 02:23:06,111
"Sunday, Monday... have fun any day."

2170
02:23:06,277 --> 02:23:12,023
“Life is full of wonders.
Enjoy everything I say.“

2171
02:23:12,183 --> 02:23:14,754
"Lot of twists and
turns in small life."

2172
02:23:14,919 --> 02:23:17,627
"Why? Why?"

2173
02:23:17,789 --> 02:23:23,262
"Small wishes...
you jump to catch them."

2174
02:23:23,428 --> 02:23:25,601
“There are no tensions
before taking birth.“

2175
02:23:25,763 --> 02:23:28,767
“Everything is cool
if you take it easily.“

2176
02:23:28,933 --> 02:23:31,607
"lf you share each
and every moment..."

2177
02:23:31,769 --> 02:23:34,443
"...every day will
be a colourful day."

2178
02:23:34,606 --> 02:23:39,316
"Beautiful! Beautiful! You have just one life.
This moment belongs to you."

2179
02:23:39,477 --> 02:23:43,619
"Beautiful! Beautiful!
You have just one life."

2180
02:23:43,781 --> 02:23:46,125
"Don't think and enjoy it."

2181
02:24:09,507 --> 02:24:12,078
"lf you behave as you want..."

2182
02:24:12,243 --> 02:24:14,780
"...the world around you..."

2183
02:24:14,946 --> 02:24:17,654
"...will appreciate you."

2184
02:24:17,815 --> 02:24:20,295
"It follows you!"

2185
02:24:20,451 --> 02:24:23,193
"lf you help then..."

2186
02:24:23,354 --> 02:24:25,994
“...friendship will remain intact.“

2187
02:24:26,157 --> 02:24:27,500
"It will remain with you..."

2188
02:24:27,659 --> 02:24:31,232
"...and it will never leave you."

2189
02:24:31,396 --> 02:24:34,104
"One, two, three, four...
there are very few moments."

2190
02:24:34,265 --> 02:24:37,041
"Life is too shod
so think with your head."

2191
02:24:37,201 --> 02:24:40,045
"Work with love, live your life."

2192
02:24:40,204 --> 02:24:42,946
"Don't keep any unfulfilled wishes."

2193
02:24:43,107 --> 02:24:47,021
"Beautiful! Beautiful! Life is one.
This moment belongs to you."
