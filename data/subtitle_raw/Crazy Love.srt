1
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:50,582
Ma?

2
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,380
Why'd you marry Dad?

3
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:59,449
He was one of my brother's friends;
one day he just asked me

4
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,927
That's it?

5
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:03,690
That's it

6
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,225
Nothing else happened?

7
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:10,427
Really?

8
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:12,370
No

9
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,239
I don't believe you.
You're leaving something out

10
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,506
- Like what?
- He had to fight for you

11
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,380
- He was a fighter, all right
- And he kidnapped you

12
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,187
Didn't he?

13
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:37,486
Yes

14
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,358
Then what happened?

15
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,999
Then he took me to a hut
up in the mountains

16
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,907
I was a prisoner there
for three days

17
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,104
Were you scared?

18
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,612
Oh, Yes.
He was so strong

19
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:00,252
Then?

20
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,353
Then he took me
to the top of the mountain

21
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,716
To show me the world

22
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,120
He said:
All that belongs to you and me

23
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:16,230
And then he kissed me so hard,
I can still feel it

24
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,703
Just like a film

25
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,907
Better... Much better

26
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:42,251
And the tits of Mary Cobb
have each one got a knob

27
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,997
To play with,
to play with...

28
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,378
I got a present...
From the boys at work

29
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:19,823
I got something, too

30
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,001
What?

31
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:27,372
Later

32
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:43,118
So?
She's still got all her clothes on

33
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:47,019
She's a princess.
They always dress in white

34
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,822
And the prince had to fight
for her first

35
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,529
Then he was allowed to marry her

36
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,526
You believe that crap?

37
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:58,903
Yes

38
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:03,102
Want to know
why grown-ups get married?

39
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:06,976
So they can fuck

40
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,982
You know what that is, fucking?

41
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,283
Not really

42
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,256
Don't know much, do you?

43
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:49,053
- That's what grown-ups do?
- If they're not fighting

44
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,352
Your parents do it, too

45
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,086
Look

46
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,263
That's your mother

47
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,064
And that's your father

48
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,374
And that's fucking

49
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,980
Like to try it?

50
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,353
Listen

51
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:37,967
To fuck well,
you have to learn to kiss well

52
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,900
I know how to kiss

53
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,271
With your tongue?

54
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:52,917
That's kissing...
And here's where you learn it

55
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:10,333
Don't worry.
I've scored here loads of times

56
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:25,643
You're lucky. That's Kathy,
she's the hottest of them all

57
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:38,552
Go and sit next to her,
or someone else will get her

58
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:50,338
- Look at her teeth!
- Then look at her legs

59
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,337
Don't tell me
you blew a chance like that!

60
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,714
I didn't know what to do

61
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,256
And now, ladies and gentlemen!

62
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,620
The most beautiful women in the world

63
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,095
Step right up! Step right up!

64
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:30,826
And let me introduce you
to Tiger Rita!

65
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:38,332
And right here the one and only
Eva Pavlova, the terror of Warsaw!

66
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:48,549
See their breasts?
They're topped with nipples

67
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:52,818
When you rub them,
they get stiff

68
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,698
And when they get stiff,
you know you're in business. Got it?

69
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,381
Here, this'll make you feel better

70
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,826
I never saw a woman like that before

71
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,827
- Beautiful...
- No, hot!

72
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:40,066
If anyone can teach you,
it's her...

73
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:26,975
What a woman!

74
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,070
Come on. Now you'll see
what fucking is

75
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,068
Mummy! Can we go?

76
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,774
- Play some more. Here
- No...

77
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,077
The ginger one is Theo.
He's in my class

78
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,753
Didn't know his mother was like that

79
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,324
- Can I come?
- Of course not...

80
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,634
Bloody hell!
That ginger bastard

81
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,375
I thought they were really
going to do it

82
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,146
Right in front of us

83
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,285
That'd have been worth seeing

84
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,785
Know where Ginger lives?

85
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,325
Yes, but I've never been there

86
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,760
Then it's time we went there to play

87
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,200
Tomorrow

88
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,166
You sure it's here?

89
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:53,144
Yes

90
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,172
What a woman

91
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:00,400
Theo?

92
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,343
I never saw a woman
like that before

93
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:54,008
- I'm horny as a rabbit
- Me, too

94
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:57,654
I need to cool down

95
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,038
That's better

96
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,568
I need some water too

97
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,310
This may be your big day, kid

98
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:26,841
I can't

99
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,915
Don't be scared.
She's blind drunk

100
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:32,784
She won't wake up

101
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,086
What shall I do?

102
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:44,157
Remember what that bloke
at the fair did to her?

103
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,399
Do the same as him

104
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:49,873
Go on

105
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,031
- She smells good
- Because she's horny

106
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,743
Lie down on top of her.
Lie down

107
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,440
I still haven't done it

108
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:18,548
I'll show you something
that'll make you feel better

109
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,424
Watch now

110
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,002
But make sure
you don't do it too often

111
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,646
You might get a crooked back

112
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,713
Or go crazy

113
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:18,000
Ma, dad didn't kidnap you, did he?

114
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:28,852
No

115
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,147
Why did you lie to me?

116
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,362
Because you're so young

117
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,399
Everything is ugly

118
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:51,236
No. There are many beautiful things
in life, son

119
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,238
Go to sleep now

120
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:08,493
- You must be nervous
- Why's that?

121
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,262
It's your last day at school

122
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,804
I can still remember
my last day at school

123
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,807
The school dance

124
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:26,176
The girls were sweating.
And not just from dancing...

125
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:46,133
- Do you use the cream I gave you?
- Every day, but it doesn't help much

126
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:50,467
- You must be patient
- I've been patient for two years

127
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,271
lt'll go away eventually

128
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,582
And if you don't scratch
you won't have any scars

129
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:05,986
Here, try this.
And come back next week

130
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,886
So what do you want to be,
later?

131
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,733
Not a doctor, for sure

132
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:28,975
Lisa Velani

133
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:45,992
I'll fuck her tonight
or my name's Harry Frankenstein

134
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,537
Harry Voss

135
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,073
Harry Voss

136
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:12,818
- Didn't dare show himself, huh?
- With that ugly spotty mug of his...

137
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:58,489
Dreaming again?
You think too much

138
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,262
lt'll give you a headache

139
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,061
Your diploma

140
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:20,445
Wondered if you wanted
to come to the school dance

141
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,752
- Why you asking me?
- Cos I don't want to go on my own

142
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,455
And I like to be the best looking

143
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,797
I don't like parties.
Too many people

144
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:40,502
- Then we'll go somewhere else
- Where?

145
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,662
Where there's no people

146
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:01,585
What you doing?

147
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:53,141
Let the wind carry my message.
In my soul there is a song

148
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:59,306
She's the answer to all my problems
Though her heart doesn't know it yet

149
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:14,227
- I didn't know you were a poet
- It's easy when you're in love

150
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,367
Know who I wrote that for?

151
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,772
Read the first letter of each line

152
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:49,494
I love her... I love them all,
but they aren't interested in me

153
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:56,337
So come to the dance
and you can read it to her

154
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,075
Are you nuts?

155
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,844
I can't even talk to her

156
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:11,183
It's easy when you're in love

157
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:16,026
You think this is what women
dream of?

158
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:21,357
You don't know women.
They can look right through men

159
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:27,297
When Lisa looks at you,
she won't see your spots...

160
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,870
she'll see the poet in your eyes

161
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,307
If you don't do it tonight
you never will

162
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:48,621
Congratulations!
The Future Beckons

163
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:16,618
See her anywhere?

164
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:25,918
- Hello Marina
- Hello, handsome

165
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,928
- Will you dance with me later?
- Of course

166
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,296
Don't forget, eh?

167
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,203
Friend of mine

168
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,448
Hey, she's on her own

169
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:54,985
- What should I do?
- Ask her to dance

170
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:58,958
- She doesn't dance
- Of course she dances. Go on

171
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,125
- OK, it's fixed
- What is?

172
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,335
You'll see. Come on

173
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,712
- There she is
- Who is?

174
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,290
Marina.
I made a date with her

175
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,484
I'll go first. Then we'll swap

176
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:54,434
- But I don't know her
- That doesn't matter

177
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,599
But I don't feel anything for her

178
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,979
That won't stop you doing it

179
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:10,715
She won't want me

180
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:18,758
She's not like Lisa.
Marina likes doing it... with everyone

181
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,388
She knows you're part of the deal

182
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:27,497
- Really?
- Yes. I'll be quick, OK?

183
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,273
I'll need some more soon

184
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,280
You can have more right now

185
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:29,187
Have you taken a pill?

186
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:37,797
No, but I've got a friend.
He's waiting outside

187
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,061
Do I know him?

188
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,808
He's a sensitive boy. A poet

189
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,341
A poet?

190
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:58,852
- All right?
- Well, if you can't do it

191
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,069
Your turn

192
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:21,803
- You sure she wants me?
- Yes, she's ready for you

193
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,776
Come on, little poet.
I'm getting cold

194
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:33,211
Sorry

195
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:49,789
Finished already?

196
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:24,481
Look, Frankenstein.
If you're trying to be funny...

197
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:34,241
- Incredible! You did it
- Yes, with shit paper

198
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,153
Any whisky left?

199
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:44,524
- In the car
- Take me home

200
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:35,968
Here, let me

201
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:05,640
Go on

202
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:09,336
Drive on!

203
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:32,118
I live right there

204
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:36,422
But I can't make it

205
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:48,206
Can't you carry me in?
I really can't make it

206
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:57,379
Is that yours?

207
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:00,112
It's my poem

208
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,921
Where did you get it?

209
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:07,426
On a train

210
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:25,045
You can keep it.
I don't need it anymore

211
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:33,918
Have a heart,
carry me indoors

212
01:01:56,279 --> 01:02:00,943
I can hear it beating...
So you have got one

213
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,027
- Bill!
- Harry!

214
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:18,334
- Where have you been?
- Vacation

215
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:20,099
For how long?

216
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:27,872
Three months in prison,
eight months in jail...

217
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:33,853
And how are you?

218
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:38,125
I'm thirsty... and broke

219
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:18,189
<Silence.
Hospital>

220
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:50,988
I'm tired

221
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:56,056
I live nearby.
I'm looking after someone's house

222
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:57,061
Someone?

223
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:03,665
Who I don't know
and who doesn't know me

224
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:31,491
- Dare we?
- For old times' sake

225
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:34,857
- We never dared before
- You never dared!

226
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,117
Let me do it

227
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,818
Nice place

228
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:53,993
So we did it

229
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:59,105
It weighed less than I thought

230
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:03,004
It was mellow

231
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,338
He's still warm

232
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:23,944
She's dead

233
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,550
But she's alive

234
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:39,362
No Harry...

235
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,437
I wouldn't do that

236
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:44,087
Best woman I ever had

237
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:49,130
You only ever meet one like that

238
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:54,968
We'd better bury her
or we'll get into trouble

239
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:57,563
She's too beautiful to bury

240
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:24,856
Where are we going?

241
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:29,294
To a wedding

242
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:57,018
And do you take
as your lawful wedded husband

243
01:19:58,193 --> 01:19:58,989
Harry Voss

244
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:15,271
For better and for worse

245
01:20:15,677 --> 01:20:16,473
Until...

246
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:22,610
...death do you part

247
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:36,489
Until death do you part
