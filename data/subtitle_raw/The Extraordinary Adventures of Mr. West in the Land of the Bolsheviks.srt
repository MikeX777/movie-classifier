1
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:28,515
Off to Russia!

2
00:00:56,285 --> 00:01:01,825
Mrs. West worries about
her husband's trip.

3
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:07,321
Cowboy Jeddy, Mr. West's
faithful servant.

4
00:01:17,915 --> 00:01:22,707
Mr. West's
morning mail.

5
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:27,476
To Mr. West...

6
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:32,836
president of the Y.M.C.A.

7
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:17,962
Dear Sir, we have learned
of your bold intention

8
00:02:17,955 --> 00:02:21,573
to investigate the land
of the Bolsheviks.

9
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:25,228
Enclosed are New York
magazines depicting

10
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:27,898
the types of people in today's
barbaric Russia.

11
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:31,367
We advise you to take
a guard and weapons.

12
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:33,150
yours truly T.P. Gallagher

13
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:55,737
A RUSSIAN BOLSHEVIK
TYPE!

14
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:03,996
"Dear, take Jeddie with you. He'll
protect you from these beasts."

15
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:18,927
A month later, West arrives
in the capital of the Bolsheviks.

16
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:24,242
Mr. West's suitcases!

17
00:03:36,795 --> 00:03:40,037
A less distinguished traveller

18
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:33,476
Garter trouble.

19
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:29,306
"Courage, boss! I'll protect you
in this barbaric country!"

20
00:06:09,755 --> 00:06:13,225
Comfort is a
relative concept.

21
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:22,545
On duty.

22
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:31,463
Once a fop,

23
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:34,356
now just a small time crook.
Zhban, the Count.

24
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:02,826
The rest of the Gang:

25
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:06,465
the "Dandy" and the "Countess"

26
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:51,385
And One-Eye.

27
00:09:58,135 --> 00:10:00,114
"There's a smell of dollars
in the air.

28
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:03,245
A surprise from America!"

29
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:52,416
Jeddie's poor brain
gets all mixed up.

30
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:23,922
"We'll swindle this Mr. West!
We'll get those dollar!"

31
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:41,117
"The Bolsheviks got
the suitcases AND Mr. West!"

32
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:34,257
Ellie, an American.

33
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:42,195
No outsiders allowed here!

34
00:20:30,885 --> 00:20:32,671
"Ellie!"

35
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:36,092
"Jed!"

36
00:20:56,145 --> 00:20:59,763
Mr. West has taken refuge
in the office of an American firm.

37
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:03,697
Without his loyal bodyguard,
he's feeling low.

38
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:53,758
The Gang goes to work.

39
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:16,590
Zhban sets a trap.

40
00:24:22,535 --> 00:24:27,370
"Tell me how did you
find my briefcase?"

41
00:24:50,805 --> 00:24:55,265
" I'll tell you the whole story.
They'll love it in America!"

42
00:25:02,995 --> 00:25:06,556
Prison

43
00:25:29,455 --> 00:25:33,195
"I rescued the briefcase, just as
it was about to be stolen!"

44
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:07,955
"I took off my hat to the most
cultured government in the world!"

45
00:26:20,805 --> 00:26:22,921
The trap is about
to spring.

46
00:27:37,305 --> 00:27:42,038
"You better stay in my apartment.
You're being followed here."

47
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:48,512
"But I have a lot of luggage."

48
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:56,707
"Take the bare essentials.
We'll come back later for the rest."

49
00:28:21,085 --> 00:28:24,043
Ellie tries to get the police...

50
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,598
to release her fellow countryman.

51
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:36,655
"I first met Jed in America.

52
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:39,876
He saved me from a
criminal attack!"

53
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:44,616
"You see, Jeddie's boss
made him think...

54
00:29:44,612 --> 00:29:48,503
all Russians are
as wild as savages."

55
00:30:47,863 --> 00:30:51,264
Jeddie is released.

56
00:31:00,403 --> 00:31:04,043
Meanwhile, Mr. West is
getting a tour of Moscow.

57
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:17,156
"Just look what these barbarians
have done to the University."

58
00:31:37,673 --> 00:31:41,723
"That's where the Imperial
Bolshoi Theatre used to be."

59
00:32:17,623 --> 00:32:19,875
"My Palace..."

60
00:32:29,673 --> 00:32:33,609
"I had to exchange it
for a hovel. Well, anyway,

61
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:37,357
you'll be closer to the cruel
realities of life today."

62
00:33:17,013 --> 00:33:19,686
Tea, Soviet style.

63
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:54,845
Jeddie sets out with Ellie...

64
00:33:54,843 --> 00:33:57,912
to look for his missing boss.

65
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:32,249
"Very accurate.
Just like in real life."

66
00:38:27,223 --> 00:38:30,943
The countess puts her heart
in her work.

67
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:43,266
Gang Number Two!

68
00:42:10,963 --> 00:42:15,286
"Get together ten scary-looking guys.
We'll put on a show of...

69
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:18,036
Bolshevik brutality for that
idiot American.

70
00:42:18,033 --> 00:42:19,751
We'll pay in dollars."

71
00:42:22,443 --> 00:42:24,434
Back in the office,

72
00:42:24,423 --> 00:42:27,278
they discuss Mr. West's
disappearance.

73
00:43:12,353 --> 00:43:15,686
"The Bolsheviks!
Run for your life!"

74
00:44:36,443 --> 00:44:40,015
"Darling, I'll show them
how an AMERICAN acts!"

75
00:52:27,643 --> 00:52:34,037
The Death Sentence!

76
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,541
Everything started
to spin around.

77
00:53:06,173 --> 00:53:08,489
Awaiting Death

78
00:53:35,673 --> 00:53:38,961
Zhban's shadow tricks

79
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:12,463
Don't despair, salvation is near.

80
00:54:12,764 --> 00:54:17,454
Give bearer 1000 dollars.

81
00:55:18,964 --> 00:55:25,964
We'll pull you up through the chimney.
Send out another $1000.

82
00:56:44,113 --> 00:56:46,320
"Our friends are on their toes!"

83
00:58:13,503 --> 00:58:17,872
Mr. West's long absence has upset
the people at the office.

84
00:58:36,703 --> 00:58:39,149
"You've got to find Mr. West today.

85
00:58:39,143 --> 00:58:42,522
I recommend that you go
to the police."

86
00:59:19,173 --> 00:59:21,710
"We're safe!"

87
01:00:16,923 --> 01:00:20,438
"I'll teach you
to kiss my wife!"

88
01:00:28,313 --> 01:00:31,092
"Calm down! Calm down!"

89
01:00:48,233 --> 01:00:51,191
"Pay him something,
for heaven's sake!"

90
01:01:40,783 --> 01:01:43,968
"Have a look at a
REAL Bolshevik."

91
01:02:30,653 --> 01:02:32,860
Reading about cowboys...

92
01:02:32,853 --> 01:02:35,253
continues to fascinate
Russian children.

93
01:03:33,183 --> 01:03:35,344
"He loves me,
he loves me not..."

94
01:04:45,933 --> 01:04:49,757
Mr. West finally sees Moscow.

95
01:04:58,083 --> 01:05:00,526
The University

96
01:05:00,853 --> 01:05:04,454
Science for the
working class

97
01:05:20,913 --> 01:05:23,063
The Bolshoi Theatre

98
01:05:45,663 --> 01:05:50,305
"Now you're going to see
THOUSANDS of real Bolsheviks."

99
01:06:11,163 --> 01:06:13,609
"Here they are!"

100
01:06:23,303 --> 01:06:25,043
"And they are all GENUINE!"

101
01:06:59,143 --> 01:07:04,212
Dear Madge, greetings from
Soviet Russia.

102
01:07:04,303 --> 01:07:09,203
Burn those New York
magazines,

103
01:07:09,303 --> 01:07:13,153
and hang a portrait
of Lenin on the wall

104
01:07:13,703 --> 01:07:18,639
Long live the Bolsheviks!
Your John.

105
01:07:20,723 --> 01:07:24,113
On the way to the
radio station.

106
01:07:57,433 --> 01:08:00,857
The Moscow radio station
