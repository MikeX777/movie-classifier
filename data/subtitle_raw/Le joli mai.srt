7
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:39,357
THE LOVELY MONTH OF MAY

8
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,831
A film by Chris Marker
and Pierre Lhomme

9
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,429
assisted by

10
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,699
Narrator

11
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,779
Executive producer

12
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,484
Librettist

13
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,552
Musician

14
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,819
Investigate rs

15
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,527
Sound men

16
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,699
Image men

17
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:25,533
Henchmen

18
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:30,681
Scissor women

19
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,619
<i>The scene is set in May 1962,</i>

20
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,252
<i>considered by some at the time
as "the first spring of peace."</i>

21
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:53,861
<i>Part One
PRAYER ON THE EIFFEL TOWER</i>

22
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,407
1st May 1962, rue des Patriarches

23
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,840
It's boring
when you work in this heat...

24
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,508
It's no fun, you slave away.

25
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,582
For my wife, one thing counts.

26
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,413
"How much did you make?"

27
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,521
She loves me for what I earn.

28
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,886
Between my boss bawling me out
and my wife...

29
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,618
I'm at peace commuting.
But now I drive in.

30
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,456
I'm not at peace anymore.

31
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,064
When are you free?

32
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,395
When I'm driving in light traffic.

33
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,632
Because I work, work, work.

34
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:34,931
Sundays, Mondays, Saturdays.

35
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:38,474
Why? For money.
I have loans, rent, all that.

36
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,043
I gotta keep working.

37
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,780
Some guys earn less than me.

38
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,849
Doing what hours?
9 am to 6 pm.

39
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,950
- And you?
- 9 am to 8 pm.

40
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,111
And I'm always on my feet.

41
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,584
You can't do it for long,
stay on your feet.

42
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,159
After 8 you're free?

43
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,792
Free to get yelled at by my wife?

44
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,426
Free for what?
Home at 8.

45
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,623
At 8.30 I eat.

46
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,167
At 9, turn on the TV.
We're fine.

47
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,402
We both watch on our own.

48
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,561
So we don't talk.

49
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,934
If I fidget, she says:

50
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,837
"Sit still.
Turn the TV off."

51
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,410
When I get home:
"I'm so tired."

52
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,171
I say:
"Yes, you're tired."

53
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,482
Lucky there aren't two.

54
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:19,480
Two what?

55
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,617
Two channels.

56
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,980
You'd have to choose.

57
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:25,089
I'd buy two sets
and work harder.

58
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:27,917
And vacations'?

59
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,787
I go to Italy.

60
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,917
To Italy.

61
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,586
You're free then?

62
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,528
No, a peaceful vacation is no good.

63
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,498
I need noise. I dance all night.

64
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,034
Daytime I rest in bed.

65
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,694
Daytime, I don't know...

66
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,466
My wife looks after the kids.

67
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,576
So I have some freedom, not much.

68
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,710
When are you happy?

69
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,539
When am I happy?

70
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:49,942
When I sell a suit.

71
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:51,907
Cash in the till.

72
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,074
Lots of cash in the till.

73
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,151
All that counts is cash.

74
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,217
- That's all?
- Sell, sell, sell. That's all.

75
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,751
And the kids' health.

76
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:01,858
Knock on wood.

77
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,086
When the kids are healthy.

78
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,558
I'm not worried.

79
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,632
What matters is cash in the till.

80
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,934
And then what?
You put it in to take it out.

81
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,036
How come?

82
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,194
To use it.

83
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,165
I buy more suits.

84
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,836
Not much margin.

85
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,535
That's modern society.

86
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,704
For me: suits,
for others: cars or movies.

87
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,940
Like your work.

88
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,051
Why produce a movie?
To make another.

89
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,813
What do you do with the money'?

90
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,751
You do the opposite now'?

91
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,185
I wouldn't say that.

92
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,251
So why do you want...

93
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,059
I buy suits.

94
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,194
You go to movies.

95
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,756
Me, movies?

96
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:39,988
There isn't much on.

97
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,223
Not much on?

98
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:42,225
What's on now'?

99
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:43,567
<i>Cleo from 5 to 7.</i>

100
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:44,667
I'll go see it.

101
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:45,700
<i>And Marienbad.</i>

102
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,997
" <i>Marienbad"?
Oh,</i> no...

103
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,104
A bit too...

104
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,865
I'm a simple guy.

105
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,940
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,906
Who says it's for intellects?

107
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:56,275
You have to figure it out, and I...

108
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,979
You understand stuff'?

109
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,674
I won't rack my brains.

110
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,683
Why fork out money
to figure things out?

111
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:03,946
Isn't it nice?

112
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,818
Sitting racking my brains,

113
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,890
isn't worth it.

114
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,550
I like these movies:

115
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,889
when stylish people pull pistols,

116
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,089
shoot each other, then make calls.

117
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,256
And I like...

118
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,000
I like historical movies.

119
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,001
You prefer killing or calling?

120
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,935
Killing, then calling.

121
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,199
Why do you like it?

122
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,873
Why?
I like watching Superman.

123
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,137
I have a hang-up: I'm dumpy.

124
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,281
I like seeing the beefcake

125
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,241
bust everything up.

126
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,845
Mind being different?

127
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,714
It's liberating.

128
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:36,751
In what way?

129
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,651
I think: "If I was like him..."

130
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,884
And at night, I think:
"I'd have done this..."

131
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,652
But you're not like him?

132
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:46,855
I'm not hung-up.

133
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,661
So long as I eat well and sleep well...

134
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,737
I eat well, sleep well
and turn in early.

135
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,736
- So you're happy?
- Right.

136
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,169
You said you weren't.

137
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,277
When I eat and sleep
and the till is full.

138
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,678
Is that your aim in life?

139
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:04,781
I need it.

140
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,076
Let's not talk politics,

141
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:09,345
liberty, equality, fraternity, OK.

142
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,915
Why not politics?

143
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,647
Politics, politics...

144
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,019
Politics for me, is living well.

145
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,888
If we say I must be free,

146
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,723
my wife and kids free,

147
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,091
that's politics.

148
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:23,894
It's another topic.
We can discuss it forever.

149
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,967
We can do things too.
Get political?

150
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,367
What kind of politics?

151
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,332
Should we make changes?

152
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,007
It must remain representative.

153
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,147
We elect parliamentarians
and they vote for us.

154
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:40,307
You have a traffic ticket,
you write to Mr. Le Pen or Mr. Thorez:

155
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,381
"I voted for you,
can you cancel this fine?"

156
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,882
A limited idea of democracy.

157
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:49,356
Not at all.
Parliamentarians who defend us.

158
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,320
No point having more.

159
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:52,754
Nothing more'?

160
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,695
We haven't done too badly
till now.

161
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:59,836
What harm has de Gaulle
done me since 1958?

162
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:00,835
None.

163
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,668
Personally, speaking for myself,

164
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,810
he's done me no harm.

165
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,672
You'll say I'm selfish.

166
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,847
But if 40 million selfish
Frenchmen unite,

167
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,277
we'd have politics.

168
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,309
A snack on the grass,

169
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,882
a picnic with your old lady...

170
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,347
You get the idea.

171
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,351
Her little transistor radio...

172
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,815
Be happy, have a drink...

173
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,925
Enjoy a nice time.

174
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,392
If you had time and money,
would you have a TV?

175
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,792
TV'? Sure would!

176
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:08,796
You bet.

177
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,027
- Here in the shop?
- No, not down here.

178
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,330
In the apartment, upstairs.

179
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,906
It's a must, isn't it.

180
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,100
Live life to the fullest.

181
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,336
We have the time.

182
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,378
You see it as a funeral?

183
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,346
Yeah, a bit like the song.

184
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:26,805
<i>Paris's oldest sign

185
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,811
<i>Paris's oldest sign
hangs over a twist club.</i>

186
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:36,118
<i>Rue Mouffetard, a working-class
neighborhood since the 17th century,</i>

187
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,058
<i>has recovered its patrician vocation.</i>

188
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,290
<i>Beetroot is cheaper
that on the Right Bank.</i>

189
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,900
<i>But not paintings.</i>

190
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:48,233
<i>This ancient Roman way
that trembled under a Praetorian march,</i>

191
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,568
<i>now leads to an unfathomable future.</i>

192
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,968
<i>There are cabarets, galleries,</i>

193
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,113
a theatre.

194
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,341
<i>10 years on, these images
will be more disorientating</i>

195
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,576
<i>than those of Paris 1900.</i>

196
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,596
<i>But Rue Mouffetard's metamorphosis</i>

197
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,841
<i>applies to half of Paris,
the most picturesque half.</i>

198
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,040
<i>Ifs easy to praise
urban transformation</i>

199
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,149
<i>when 1 in 20 homes
has no electricity,</i>

200
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,251
<i>1 in 12 no water.</i>

201
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:38,554
<i>Yet carriages often lose
the charm of pumpkins,</i>

202
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:42,256
<i>Europe's future capital

203
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:46,056
<i>that modest treasure
defined in one word:</i>

204
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,357
<i>"friendliness."</i>

205
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,190
Why do you like this area?

206
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:53,360
I love it here.
The friendliness...

207
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:58,032
It's "La Mouffe."
It's genuine.

208
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,973
It's "La Mouffe."
You can't leave.

209
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,205
I wouldn't move for anything.

210
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,178
Bury me in this street.

211
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,582
Is there a question
of you being rehoused afterwards?

212
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,480
- Sure.
- Where will you go?

213
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,983
Like everyone.
We'll look for a place.

214
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,063
Somewhere nice and calm.
And friendly.

215
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,995
<i>Oh, if you knew Maubeuge</i>

216
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,535
<i>I knew great love</i>

217
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,137

218
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,648

221
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,959
What will you miss most?

222
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,636
The alley.

223
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:03,201
- This place?
- The back room. And here.

224
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,338
Anything, everything.

225
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,712
You have to admit it.

226
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,309
This is our home.

227
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,246
Anywhere else we'd feel deported.

228
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:49,806
The present solutions,

229
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:54,082
which are fastidious,
monotonous, inhuman,

230
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,186
dreary, ugly and all that...

231
00:17:56,342 --> 00:18:00,154
arise because no one conceives it
any other way.

232
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,759
The basic aim is not that at all.

233
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,389
The aim is money.

234
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,392
It's money.

235
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:09,522
That's why another technique
is possible.

236
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,691
We must explore techniques.

237
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:16,602
But first we determine the context.

238
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,232
Not a context where land
costs 150 000 francs the square meter.

239
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,639
It's impossible.

240
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,407
That context calls for skyscrapers.

241
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,813
Skyscrapers can be beautiful,
but in Paris...

242
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,152
It could work...

243
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:33,620
but multiplying them
like in the 15th district is ridiculous.

244
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,461
What would you do on this site?

245
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,157
Well, ideally...

246
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,295
I'd start by planting trees.

247
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,665
Trees and greenery.

248
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,103
We're asking you to house people.

249
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:53,471
And then...
We can't narrow it down to sites.

250
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,271
It's a global approach.

251
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,313
We can start imagining from there.

252
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:03,382
Tiny little things hidden in the trees,

253
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,351
like birds,
and near them,

254
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,513
in the trees and greenery...

255
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,125
A ground floor'?

256
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,753
A ground floor and upper floors,

257
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,294
as high as the trees.

258
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,729
A bit higher, but not much.

259
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,800
Always in contact with nature.

260
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,729
On every level,

261
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,535
everyone will have
their own little garden.

262
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:26,802
Little ponds.

263
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,670
Kids playing there like monkeys
or squirrels,

264
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,612
flying from tree to tree,
to each house.

265
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,480
We could create wonders,

266
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:39,248
joyful, connected to nature.
You see?

267
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,222
- You know Babar?
- That's it. Right.

268
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:46,327
Célesteville.
I totally agree with Célesteville.

269
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,159
No point being rigid and cold.

270
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,528
Not a suburban Célesteville,

271
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,762
each house saying:
"I'm the best."

272
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,907
No. People happy to live together.

273
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,674
Exactly. I agree.

274
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:02,335
It reflects how we dislike
living together.

275
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,708
- It pisses us off.
- Right.

276
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,508
We hear the neighbors.

277
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:11,553
But what you're saying means
other changes besides architecture.

278
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,453
At one point architects must say:

279
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:18,652
"it's great to be together.
Not boring or ponderous."

280
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,593
Are the people happy

281
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,424
in this neighborhood?

282
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,592
Some are very happy, but others...

283
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,534
They say this neighborhood is a bit...

284
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,436
A lot of gossip goes on here.

285
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:35,443
Especially here, in these projects.
They're very big.

286
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:40,209
A lot of people. All nosing
into everyone else's business.

287
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:44,878
Do you think the people here
would move out if they could?

288
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,416
A lot would.

289
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,717
Yes, a lot.

290
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,554
- Would you?
- Right away.

291
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,788
If I had a chance,
I'd leave immediately.

292
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,763
- What stops you...
- The rehousing issue.

293
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,633
- What did you say?
- Me?

294
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:02,329
- Yes, what?
- That it's prehistoric.

295
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:03,565
What's prehistoric?

296
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,003
- The walls.
- The walls?

and to garden?

311
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,820
I don't really know.

It's hard to grow pansies in pots.

314

I sow them in my garden,
then replant them.

How do you feel about plastic flowers?

326

They're nice too,
but not worth real ones.

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,804
- You have plastic flowers?
- In my garden.

328
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:48,708
You mix them with real flowers
so they'll look natural?

329
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:52,008
They're there as the others
haven't bloomed.

330
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,951
What gave you the idea
of growing flowers?

331
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,583
It was just an idea.

Yes. And we waited.

344
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:40,681
Then one day,
a nice gentleman looked into my case.

345
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:44,953
Then on Wednesday, I got a letter
saying I'd been rehoused.

348
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:51,959
Yes. He even waited to hear the news!

349
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:54,764
- He waited?
- For me to read it.

350
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:58,898
To know if we were rehoused
or we had to wait.

351
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:02,511

he was as happy as me.

352
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,705
It was the morning mail?

00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,941

00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,847
No, he comes home for lunch.

355
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,648
When he heard,
he was as happy as me.

356
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,721
How did you tell him?

357
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:14,983
I didn't say anything.

358
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:19,186
The table was set,
I'd put the envelope on his plate.

359
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,760
When he came in
he saw it on his plate.

360
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,198
He sort of guessed.
But he wasn't sure.

361
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,799
When he read it
he was so happy.

362
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,497
Was he in a good mood before?

363
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,642
He's always in a good mood.

364
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:35,677
But he could hardly eat.

365
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,814
Had you seen the new place?

366
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,214
You just knew you had one.

367
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,744
We knew. Yes.

368
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:46,014
- You've visited it?
- Yes. Yesterday.

369
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:48,784
- Your impressions?
- I don't know.

370
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:52,588
When I saw those big rooms
I felt lost.

371
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:57,166
I felt... I don't know.
I had no idea it was like that.

372
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,164
How many rooms?

373
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,236
3 bedrooms, a living room,

374
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:05,541
kitchen, water closet, toilet,
and a hallway.

375
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:09,042
Big closets.
I don't know where I'll put things

376
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:11,579
as we'll have so much space.

377
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,741
- You'll arrange it.
- I'll find a way.

378
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,319
Have you thought about the move'?

379
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,850
Oh, yes!
My husband and I are planning it.

380
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:23,186
We haven't stopped.

381
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:26,625
It's all we talk about,
our new home.

382
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,733
Do you think it will improve
your private life'?

383
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:36,600
- That's for sure.
- A change in your life style?

384
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,265
We're not free with the kids around.

385
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,805
They'll have their room
and we'll have ours.

386
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,949
We'll feel like young newlyweds again!

387
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,810
- How many children do you have?
- Eight.

388
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,989
And a little niece we adopted.

389
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,123
An adopted niece?

390
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,725
We lost a sister-in-law recently.

391
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:59,886
We placed her 6 children in the family.

392
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:03,795
- You took a child?
- Yes, a little girl aged 9.

393
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,095
- So you have 9 children?
- Nine.

394
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:07,931
Plus you and your husband?

395
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:11,870
How do you manage
to live in this room?

396
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,101
I have a large bed

397
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,111
in the bedroom,
a big bed where I put 4 children.

398
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,376
I have a folding bedstead where 2 sleep.

399
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,845
And a cot for my youngest.

400
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,785
This child sleeps in the dining room,

401
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,947
between me and my husband.

402
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,129
Dining room...
the room we use as a kitchen.

403
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:35,026
We separate it
so the kids aren't with us.

404
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,098
And when a child falls ill?

405
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:40,203
He stays in bed but he can't rest.

406
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:46,403
What do you think of your bedroom'?
Tell me.

407
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,837
- It's beautiful.
- How will you feel?

408
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,108
Better, as we'll be warmer.

409
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:56,116
Warmer?
But there were four of you.

410
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,387
- You'll sleep better?
- Yes.

411
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:02,817
- This room is for you three?
- The three boys.

412
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,688
The three boys' bedroom.

413
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,194
Now we'll look at the girls' room.

414
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:13,095
Come on, girls. This is your room.
What do you think?

415
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:14,770
It's fine.

416
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:17,032
Happy to have your own room?

417
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:22,006
You won't have to sleep
at grandma's now.

418
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:25,444
You won't have to go out at night.

419
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,875
Was it hard sleeping there?

420
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,748
Especially with the "Harkis" close by.

421
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,389
She was scared of going past them.

422
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,191
We had to take her every night.

423
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,827
She was so scared.

424
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,863
Hey, your chewing gum!

425
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,000
Is it still the same school?

426
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,397
Until the end of the year.

427
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:50,865
- Then somewhere closer'?
- They'll go to the local school.

428
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,873
Do you mind changing schools?

429
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,777
You have a schoolmaster?

430
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,111
No, a schoolmistress.

431
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:05,278
Do you mind leaving her
or don't you care?

432
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:07,156
Not bothered?

433
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,987
No, a schoolmistress
ls a schoolmistress.

434
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:12,753
Don't climb, you'll fall.

435
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,159
The boys are all watching us.

436
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,858
Sure they are.
Nobody knows you.

437
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:21,129
Look. Everyone's watching you.

438
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,499
He's on the grass.

439
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:26,035
We didn't have windows
to look out of before.

440
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,406
Are you happy?

441
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,856
She said: "First I opened the door,
I found myself in the kitchen."

442
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,384
Can you see the school?

443
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,892
No. It's on the other side.

444
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:48,031
- Who is'?
- The school.

445
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,927
Oh, the school!

446
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,899
Behave yourselves.
And don't fall off.

447
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:59,975
Want to? Want to?

448
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:03,308
What did you say?

449
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,813
- Look at the statue.
- You see, there's a statue.

450
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,110
With a star.

451
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,445
And a star.

452
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,050
And bikes hanging!

453
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:26,324
What do you expect from life'?
Want to continue?

454
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,204
What do you expect from life'?
Want to continue?

455
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,137
Sure. I still like it.

456
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,208
I don't plan to give up.

457
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:38,007
You see yourselves
as stockbrokers?

458
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,877
- Hardly.
- Not that far.

459
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,540
Then <i>as</i> what?

460
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,587
- Head clerk.
- Service head.

461
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,253
Service head after, if possible.

462
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,221
And then? No higher'?

463
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,918
Managing director.
Then boss.

464
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:55,554
- Nothing more ambitious?
- That's it. Sorry.

465
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:57,366
Why?

466
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,562
You can't be a gopher forever.

467
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,908
Sure. What's good
about being the boss?

468
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:08,840
Earning more'?
Having more power?

469
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,412
- Sure, I'd like that.
- Power.

470
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,345
You'd like power?

471
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,376
What is money, in your view?

472
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,418
- Lots of things.
- For instance?

473
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:23,124
With money, you can eat.
That's the first thing.

474
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,056
And then what?

475
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,531
You can have a lot of fun.

476
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,492
What kind of fun?

477
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,604
Entertainments...

478
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:37,602
The theatre.

479
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:40,273
That's entertainment. Movies...

480
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:43,037
What else?

481
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,008
- It's a bit limited.
- I don't know.

482
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:56,088
Do you have interests outside
your work and entertainment?

483
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:59,559
Other things you care about?
Like current events?

484
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,192
Yes, of course.

485
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,264
Because they influence the Stock Market?

486
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:04,423
It depends.

487
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:09,299
What sort of things?
Like "major events"?

488
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:11,338
Yes, for the Stock Market.

489
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,407
What recent major events?

490
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:16,341
The Algiers putsch.

491
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:20,005
- I'll inform the Association.
- Go ahead.

492
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:23,619
What gives you the right
to make kids work?

493
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,511
We're not asking them secrets.

494
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:29,124
There are no secrets.
You're interviewing minors.

495
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,693
Want to ask my toddler his views?

496
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,291
Good idea. Bring him in.

497
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:38,060
I feel like answering, that's all.

498
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:40,533
What's it to him'?

499
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,465
We're filming.

500
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,370
You're not obliged to answer.

501
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:50,411
May I ask how long
you've been coming here?

502
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,048
Over 25 years.

503
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:55,276
Over 25 years.
And you like it here?

504
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,544
It's my profession.

505
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,654
- You enjoy it?
- Very much.

506
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,115
Was it by choice?

507
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:06,657
When I finished my studies,
I didn't plan on the Stock Market.

508
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,998
But I had acquaintances.

509
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:12,397
I got in through them
and I never left.

510
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:13,729
What do you do?

511
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,002
I'm a stockbroker.

512
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,004
Can I ask a general question

513
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,439
to do with your work
and other issues?

514
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,510
What does money mean to you?

515
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:26,378
It's a means of existence.

516
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,575
Which stocks have risen most today?

517
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,345
- Cofirep.
- What's that?

518
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,319
An oil research company.

519
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:37,290
The day Algeria was in the worst state
since '58.

520
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:40,430
Yes. The market is dependent,
as I said.

521
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,065
Is it a coincidence?

522
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,360
It's not a coincidence.

523
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,595
Not a coincidence.

524
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,706
It's the big investors who said...

525
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:54,566
It's empirical.
There's no explanation.

526
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:57,043
It's a state of mind.
A psychosis.

527
00:33:57,202 --> 00:34:00,115
Before, it would have dropped 10%.
It's up 7%.

528
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:03,276
It's serious if laws don't apply now.

529
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,182
It's not about laws.

530
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,790
No. The gentleman means
"natural laws."

531
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,024
Not legislative laws.

532
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,561
They have no bearing here anymore.

533
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,598
You said:
"Woe to the man with judgment."

534
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:22,296
Yes, if he uses his judgment here,
he's ruined.

535
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,066
Really? Do explain.

536
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:29,736
He mentioned Cofirep.
I didn't follow the trading today.

537
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:34,140
He said events in Algeria
should have made stocks fall 10%.

538
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:35,307
They rose.

539
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,146
The only ones that did.

540
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:40,518
Yesterday he'd have said:
"Algeria looks bad.

541
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,626
- "Something will happen."
- I'll sell!

542
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,422
"I had news from the Algiers police.

543
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,566
"Something awful will happen tonight."

544
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:53,498
He would have sold yesterday.
Today he's right.

545
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:58,198
Right about the facts.
But not about the effects.

546
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:00,070
A personal question?

547
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,142
When you hear bad news,

548
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,749
is your first reaction how
it will affect the Stock Market or...

549
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,416
No, our first reaction is patriotic.

550
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:11,849
True for everyone?

551
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,384
- I speak for my generation.
- I'd say the opposite.

552
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,390
Him and me, I'm sure.

553
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:22,430
I'd have said the opposite.
Here's a striking example.

554
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,193
February 6th, everyone came out.

555
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:29,305
We sang <i>The</i> Marseillaise
as Daladier had resigned.

556
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,737
Everyone began buying shares.

557
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:36,743
3 months later, the radicals in power
rejected the government.

558
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:41,145
Everyone who'd bought shares
took the rap.

559
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:46,517
Until Flandin, a moderate radical,
returned to power.

560
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:50,785
In conclusion, I say:
So much for your national ideals.

561
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,856
"Wipe your feet on them."

562
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:57,667
The same facts,
the same political situation,

563
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,735
the same political
and economic situation

564
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:06,308
can have the opposite effect

565
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:10,571
at a different moment in time.

566
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:14,512
The same situation

567
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,710
can go one way today,

568
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,719
three years from now,
it can go another way.

569
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:23,223
A striking example in current events.

570
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:26,692
- You see it everywhere.
- A striking example.

571
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,355
You have stock in Northern Rail.

572
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,728
It's worth 42 francs.

573
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:36,566
Everyone says it's worth
70 to 80 francs, in portfolios.

574
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:40,801
It never goes up.
Pompidou gets in, it's worth 53.

575
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,342
That's the Rothschilds.

576
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,811
Nothing had changed about the affair.

577
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,449
People said: "Really? Good."

578
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:51,815
The Rothschilds bought it
to back their candidate.

579
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,192
They said: "Hello, investment company?
Onwards!"

580
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,327
And everyone went for it.

581
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:00,246
The peso won't be devalued.

582
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:04,587
Peronism nowadays is nothing like

583
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,730
the Peronist era ten years ago.

584
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:09,024
Nothing like it.

585
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:12,425
The Peronists will help.

586
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,678
"Some play the Market
Other pick pockets

587
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,718
POET'S FAIR

588
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,618
"But I don't give a damn

589
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:09,088
"I'm a very happy man

590
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:10,619
"Yes, yes, yes...

591
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:15,025
"Some can't stand it
Without cash, life's a gambit

592
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:19,334
"But let me tell you

593
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,060
"I don't know any song

594
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:23,531
"I can't even sing along

595
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,699
"But when broke, I feel wings grow

596
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,778
"When broke, I'm graceful as a doe

"I'm like a fish in his sea

598
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,749
"I'm happy as any king can be."

599
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,917
Tell me when to speak.

600
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:51,098
Monsieur Sulta,
Prince Murat's envoy,

601
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,927
will present the doves

602
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:59,366
to the Poets' Muse of 1962.

603
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,702
"Within sight of my yearning eyes,

604
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:06,110
"Soar aloft, bearer of messages,

605
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:11,614
"Return to me,
Show me white hands."

606
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,686
Bravo.

607
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,084
Lovely.

608
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,858
They didn't go very far.

609
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:25,468
Cutie, why won't you fly?
Haven't I been nice to you'?

610
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,762
Silly. You're not beautiful.

611
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,803
<i>The dove is not beautiful.</i>

612
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:33,067
<i>It's a dirty, cruel creature.</i>

613
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:38,511
<i>The owl is beautiful, pleasant, deep.</i>

614
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,777
<i>Why search for beauty in a dove</i>

615
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,571
<i>and poetry in poets?</i>

616
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:13,773
<i>When you have owls,
painters, cosmonauts,</i>

617
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,884
<i>Inventors, lovers...</i>

618
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:18,018
<i>And Pierrot the cabbie.</i>

619
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:21,214
P.P., licensed tire repairman

620
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,459
Stay put...

621
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,930
Well, well.

622
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:41,077
What do you think?

623
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:44,941
Interesting.
How long have you been doing this?

624
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,140
- About a year.
- A year?

625
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:51,954
A year. I do it
when I feel like painting.

626
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,091
Sometimes two weeks
or a month go by.

627
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,691
How long did this take?

628
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:57,952
This one...

629
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:02,153
I worked on it for about 20 hours.

630
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,126
Getting the colors right is tricky.

631
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,668
I do several sessions.
Not continually

632
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:12,933
Sometimes I work <i>2</i> hours a day.
Sometimes 3 or 5.

633
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:16,010
Or not at all.
It just depends.

634
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,909
- Is it relaxing?
- It's a hobby. I enjoy it.

635
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:21,878
What are you depicting?

636
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,511
- I wanted to depict Christ.
- Right.

637
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,987
With the angels overhead.

638
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:33,554
And the...
What are they called in Spain?

639
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:36,597
The priests...

640
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,234
You know, the monks with hats on.

641
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,732
- The processions.
- The monks, angels and nuns.

642
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:47,905
It's the man who died
at the foot of the cross.

643
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,070
Did certain painters influence you?

644
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,546
No, I want to follow my own vision.

645
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:55,979
I don't like copying.

646
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,086
Follow your own vision?

647
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:02,088
Not always do the same painting,
like they do.

648
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,954
You have to find something new.

649
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:08,757
Not copy people.
Find something new.

650
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,957
That's worthwhile.

651
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,166
Here's a modern art influence.

652
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,669
It's modern art, yes.

653
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:22,572
I get around a lot
but I haven't seen work like this.

654
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:26,008
Let's hope it will do well.

655
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,741
I have a dozen finished paintings.

656
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,045
In oils?

657
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,586
- On canvas?
- Oils on canvas.

658
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:39,327
The hardest thing to get right
is the colors.

659
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:41,823
You have a system for colors?

660
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:46,799
I focus, I study...
Then I put the color down.

661
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,962
It's hard with pale colors like that.

662
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,698
Do you draw first?

663
00:43:51,863 --> 00:43:56,073
I draw first,
then I do the colors.

664
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:59,006
It's very difficult.

665
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,640
Once a color is painted in,
changing it is...

666
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:05,913
It all has to blend in together.

667
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:09,857
I think I'll come up with something.

668
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,324
- Will you exhibit?
- Maybe later on.

669
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:16,756
- Where?
- I don't know. A local gallery.

670
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:20,359
How do people react generally?

671
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:24,365
They like them,
the colors, the whole thing.

672
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:28,040
Do they say why they like them?

673
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,077
Yes, they find them cheerful.

674
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,123
How long is it on'?
A month?

675
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:45,984
Christ and the angels.

676
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,754
Is this another study?

677
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:52,362
Yes, a study done on...

678
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:57,299
How can I explain?
A tire ad.

679
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:02,777
It was out up and dented.
Look at the back.

680
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,079
Dented with a hammer.

681
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:11,346
I brought the lines out in paint.
It's Cosmic Man.

682
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,154
Why?

683
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:16,155
The subject appeared like that.

684
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:19,124
I wanted to accentuate the colors

685
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:22,127
to describe the character of the cosmos,

686
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,357
based on the dents on the back.

687
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,134
What is the character of the cosmos?

688
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,329
The man with gadgets on his head,

689
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,405
the wires and everything.

690
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:54,893
19 May, Palais de la Découverte

691
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:59,865
The space capsule in which John Glenn
circled the Earth

692
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:03,968
- Please, gentlemen.
- I've been on line for 3 hours.

693
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:07,507
Yes, but look at all the people
behind you.

694
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,336
Excuse me, but...

695
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,522
Do you read about all this?

696
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:34,903
Yes. The planets and stars.

697
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:39,236
And about rockets too.

698
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:42,241
You're interested in rockets'?

699
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,472
What do you think of John Glenn?

700
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:49,249
I like what he did.

701
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:54,550
It's difficult to do what he did.

702
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:01,456
To go up in a rocket
without being scared or...

703
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,955
Don't you think he was scared?

704
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:08,433
Maybe he was,
but not too scared.

705
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,800
It's terrible for a genuine inventor
who has an idea.

706
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:19,243
I don't mean a hunch.

707
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:22,441
- His brain works nonstop, even asleep.
- Asleep?

708
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:32,326
22 May, Paris Fair

709
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:36,829
- Why the name "Destiny"?
- Because I've been through a lot.

710
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:41,595
The first time I had a serious accident,

711
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:45,271
I realized that I only survived

712
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,409
because I was lucky.

713
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:50,910
She was called "Malakoff"
because that was where I lived.

714
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:56,313
I renamed her "Destiny"
as I was fated to surface.

715
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:59,250
It's the story of my life.
My destiny.

716
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,481
- You had a rough ride'?
- What?

717
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:04,125
Lots of ups and downs'?

718
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,022
My life's always been hard.

719
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:09,995
I make it by the skin of my teeth,
every time.

720
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:11,997
So luck is on my side.

721
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:14,363
I always say: "It's destiny."

722
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:17,904
What other accidents have you had?

723
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:22,568
A breakdown once,
but I managed to scrape by.

724
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:26,244
A spark plug burned out
in the middle of the Seine.

725
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,543
The pier wasn't far off.

726
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,352
I said:
"If I can't start, I crash."

727
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:34,888
I try 4 or <i>5</i> times,
the pier gets closer.

728
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,149
I'm heading for it.

729
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,350
I have one more try...

730
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:41,463
Like saying:
"In the name of the Father."

731
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:45,294
The engine starts up.
That's destiny.

732
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:48,197
Luck plays a big part in life.

733
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,430
But the best luck is hands.

734
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,268
They're the best capital you can have.

735
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:56,241
These hands are my capital.

736
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,543
A woman I know, a fine person,

737
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:05,312
told me: "Son, your best capital
is your two hands.

738
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:07,615
"You may have money in the bank,

739
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:11,357
"but if you don't work
to keep up your account,

740
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:12,357
"it falls apart."

741
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,963
So in the end,
it all comes down to luck.

742
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,293
And determination.

743
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:22,632
If a man really wants to succeed
he can, he gets lucky.

744
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,532
Of course, some people are unlucky.

745
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,607
Do we make our own luck?

746
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,104
We help it along?

747
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:34,010
We do our bit
and luck does the rest.

748
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:38,017
But luck is two hands
and the will to succeed.

749
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,483
Like winning a war.

750
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:43,386
- You have the will to succeed?
- I think so.

751
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,026
Succeed in what?

752
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,253
I want to make it.

753
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:51,594
First, to prove to myself
that I'm capable of it.

754
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:56,568
And I want to be well-known.

755
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,230
That still bugs me.

756
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:00,238
Why?

757
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:04,140
Well, it's to do with my family.

758
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:08,147
I said: "Right, I'm going to prove

759
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:11,252
"that my name can be world famous."

760
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:15,550
They've always seen me as...
Inventors are wacky.

761
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:18,387
- Weaving spiders' webs?
- Exactly.

762
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:21,359
But no matter,
we don't give a damn.

763
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,261
What counts is the result.

764
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:29,234
We say: "You guys
with your fancy equipment and stuff...

765
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:31,737
"We work on a shoe string.

766
00:50:32,096 --> 00:50:34,542
"But we still get great results.

767
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,406
"Here's the proof of it."

768
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,726
- Are we doing 100'?
- Yes, 100.

769
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:56,655
I can let go of the steering wheel.

770
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:01,667
You'll see,
the car keeps on straight ahead.

771
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,101
No danger whatsoever.

772
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:07,404
We're on a track though.

773
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:08,709
With the stabilizer.

774
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,807
You say "we",
meaning all inventors?

775
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:13,546
- Of course.
- Or you mean yourself?

776
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:17,516
No, I'm thinking about the others,
we mustn't forget...

777
00:51:17,675 --> 00:51:20,588
I know a lot of private inventors.

778
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:25,284
Some are helped by their wives
who encourage them.

779
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:28,191
They're more resilient that others

780
00:51:28,352 --> 00:51:30,389
who are alone with no help.

781
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,295
Inventors are men too.

782
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:36,403
I think that's what is needed.

783
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,702
Look at all the great statesmen,
without exception.

784
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:43,811
There's always a woman behind them.

785
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:47,149
It's beyond dispute.
It's been proved.

786
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:51,080
Nowadays... take Churchill.

787
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:55,621
When he made a speech
his wife was always at his side.

788
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,556
All great men
have someone to help them.

789
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:01,560
We need that spare wheel.

790
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:03,756
You think Stalin had someone?

791
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:08,228
Stalin is something else.
We don't know much about that aspect.

792
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:09,427
We can't know.

793
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:11,664
You think he had a muse?

794
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:12,739
A what?

795
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:13,630
Yes, the joy of making a home.

796
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,838
Yes, the joy of making a home.

797
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,342
Lots of young people like us
think about a home.

798
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:23,644
Making it nice.

799
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,753
A car. Going out.

800
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:31,382
Going for drives...

801
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:35,892
Going on holiday,
even going camping.

802
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:38,494
- You like camping?
- I love it.

803
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,397
- Do you, Mademoiselle?
- Yes.

804
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:43,731
She hasn't done much
but she'll love it.

805
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,372
And the others?

806
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,668
- What others?
- All the others.

807
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,902
I think they're like us.

808
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,245
Why not'?

809
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,917
Why can't you compare them to us?

810
00:52:57,274 --> 00:53:01,620
There aren't many of them, like us.

811
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:04,919
What's the difference?
They love each other less?

812
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:06,784
No, but it's not the same.

813
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,395
Meaning?

814
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:16,331
You mean it's always been
very serious between us.

815
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:18,566
It's been six years?

816
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,337
- How old are you'?
- We're both 21.

817
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:25,173
- I'm 21 tomorrow.
- 21 tomorrow.

818
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:29,546
We were 15 when we met.

819
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,584
We've always been faithful.

820
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:34,416
- At first, just friends.
- We were only 15.

821
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:37,218
We didn't see each other often...

822
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,851
But we always hoped we would.

823
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:41,958
Were you neighbors?

824
00:53:42,486 --> 00:53:45,729
Not at all.
We weren't so lucky.

825
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,869
We met at a wedding.

826
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,212
Smile.

827
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:15,876
Once you're married with kids,

828
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,383
what will you want for them?

829
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:19,680
For them?

830
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:23,985
We'll try to give them
the best life we can.

831
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:28,823
Sure. We don't know what sort,
it depends on them.

832
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:31,125
On what they want and...

833
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:33,934
But they probably won't be like us.

834
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:38,801
Does it depend on the world?
Do you see clouds ahead?

835
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,442
Apart from illness.

836
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:47,741
Yes, of course.
Otherwise I don't see...

837
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:50,408
Ever think about major events?

838
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:56,081
I don't want to think about all that.
Once you start...

839
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:59,017
Anyway, it's out of our hands.

840
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:02,129
No, I don't want to think about that.

841
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:05,092
- There's nothing we can do.
- Nothing?

842
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:08,026
No. We can't take it into account.

843
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:11,434
There's no point worrying about it.

844
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:14,474
I'm off to Algeria soon.

845
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:18,545
I'm leaving in about ten days.

846
00:57:18,702 --> 00:57:21,842
I know it all happens that way.

847
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:25,179
I'm not making a thing of it.
I'm going there...

848
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:30,514
I don't dare think about it.
I don't want to.

849
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:34,629
So there are no problems
outside your own happiness?

850
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:42,866
I don't want to think
about historical events...

851
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:47,441
Do you feel solidarity toward people
less happy than you'?

852
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:56,111
There aren't many of them?

853
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:00,717
Yes, there are.
But anyway...

854
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:04,148
I don't know.
If everyone was like us...

855
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:05,515
It would be...

856
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:08,891
It would be nice.
We get on with everyone.

857
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,464
Yes, but...

858
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:16,229
I say people can do what they like.

859
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,539
But you have your own opinion?

860
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:25,237
When you have children,
will it change a bit?

861
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:28,139
Maybe as we get older...

862
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:30,243
Yes, possibly.

863
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:33,087
How do you feel about growing old?

864
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:37,919
Do you think your happiness
will last, will it change?

865
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:40,057
I hope so.

866
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,255
Do you ever think about it'?

867
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:48,798
I don't know,
but I believe we're happy.

868
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:53,669
Some people say
after years of marriage you get a bit...

869
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:57,573
I believe in eternal happiness.

870
00:58:58,168 --> 00:59:02,583
<i>End of Part One</i>

871
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:21,099
<i>Lovely May, always a holiday</i>

872
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:25,229
<i>With lily of the valley in his hair</i>

873
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:29,634
<i>On his heart he wore the ribbon</i>

874
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,771
<i>A ribbon of joy for lovely May</i>

875
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:37,942
<i>On his heart he wore the ribbon</i>

876
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:42,181
<i>A ribbon of joy for lovely May</i>

877
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:46,589
<i>We kept it for as long
as we believed him</i>

878
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:50,789
<i>He left while we slept</i>

879
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:54,993
<i>Taking the key to our romance</i>

880
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:59,163
<i>Lovely May won't be back again</i>

881
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:03,675
<i>Taking the key to our romance</i>

882
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:07,907
<i>Lovely May won't be back again</i>

883
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:18,656
<i>Lovely May, our love was so brief</i>

884
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:22,695
<i>Summer comes bringing regrets</i>

885
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:26,801
<i>The sun reduces our dreams to ashes</i>

886
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:30,996
<i>On the moon there are no vacancies</i>

887
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:35,109
<i>The sun reduces our dreams to ashes</i>

888
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:40,613
<i>And the moon is full, no vacancies</i>

889
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:45,276
<i>Lovely May, you've left your daydreams</i>

890
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:50,057
<i>To grow roots in the streets of Paris</i>

891
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:54,286
<i>Your scarf cast over lying eyes</i>

892
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:58,360
<i>Your red in the throat of the year</i>

893
01:00:58,722 --> 01:01:02,693
<i>Your scarf cast over lying eyes</i>

894
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:07,899
<i>Your red in the throat of the year</i>

895
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:30,229
Part Two
THE RETURN OF FANTOMAS

896
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:04,258
You draw your firearm
and shoot immediately.

897
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:07,994
It's like holding a stone
at this height.

898
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:11,764
You should have fired
before it hits the ground.

899
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:14,431
It's about <i>2</i> seconds.

900
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:16,405
That's interesting,

901
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:20,145
as it's used by gangsters, right?

902
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:21,907
The police shoot first.

903
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:25,246
But do cops or gangsters
come to train here?

904
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,115
I'd say the police.

905
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,290
When did you get that target?

906
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:31,392
About a year ago.

907
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:50,038
<i>Poujade warned us</i>

908
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:53,842
<i>Long live Jeanson</i>

909
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:12,108
<i>Here lived E. Lemarchand, fallen
in the antifascist combat 8 Feb. 1962</i>

910
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:22,954
You see.
They're shooting a movie.

911
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:25,116
Was the month of May important?

912
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:27,693
Did anything happen in May?

913
01:06:28,051 --> 01:06:29,962
For me, May was...

914
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,599
Dreary. I had no work at all.

915
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:35,235
- None?
- Very tough.

916
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,598
Lousy weather, just my luck.

917
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,070
Why didn't you work in May?

918
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:41,538
Because of the weather.

919
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:42,641
Why is it bad?

920
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:46,970
The atomic bomb is bringing
this cold weather.

921
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:49,275
- The atom bomb'?
- Yes, sure.

922
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:51,282
Is that what you remember in May'?

923
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:54,384
No other events?

924
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:56,148
And you?

925
01:06:56,312 --> 01:07:00,419
Apart from the atom bomb
bringing cold weather?

926
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:03,291
No, things were normal in May.

927
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:06,467
Does the plastic bombing shock you?

928
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:10,571
Of course. It's stupid.
But what can you do?

929
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:14,106
- They do it...
- Because they need money.

930
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:16,608
It's to punish someone.

931
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:19,713
It's because they need money.
That's why.

932
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:21,776
Yeah, it's for money.

933
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:25,745
But all those guys
from Algeria have money.

934
01:07:26,109 --> 01:07:28,453
- The "Pieds-Noirs" settlers have money.
- So?

935
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:31,217
They're not fighting for money.

936
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:34,453
For what then?
For glory?

937
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:37,621
To keep Algeria French.
But that's over.

938
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:41,564
You yourself say it's over,
so what's the point?

939
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:46,070
We can't do anything.
It's not up to us.

940
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:49,073
Would you say we live in a democracy?

941
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,602
A democracy?

942
01:07:56,139 --> 01:08:00,645
We will be.
We'll become a democracy.

943
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,380
What are we now?

944
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:05,253
- A republic, I suppose.
- Yes, me too.

945
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:10,621
I don't know about democracy.
Maybe we'll become democrats.

946
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:11,697
Maybe.

947
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:15,063
Do you feel we're advancing?

948
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:18,796
Ask the boys at the top, not us.

949
01:08:19,162 --> 01:08:22,803
But he's asking us.
Answer yes or no.

950
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:25,112
Right, I Will!

951
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:28,215
But he's telling me,
I can't do anything...

952
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:32,683
He should tell a gentleman
who can do something.

953
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:36,317
What do you want from life?

954
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:39,755
Me? To marry and have a child.

955
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,323
And be happy.
Have a home.

956
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:46,126
Would your child be happy
in present day conditions?

957
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:50,797
If he's not into political issues,
he'll be happy.

958
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,605
Can one be happy under a dictator?

959
01:08:53,763 --> 01:08:55,436
- Absolutely.
- It's tolerable?

960
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:56,508
What are you talking about?

961
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,442
A dictatorship is tolerable...

962
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:01,639
if it's an intelligent one.

963
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:04,543
If it's not an intelligent dictatorship?

964
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:07,881
It falls apart. No need to worry.

965
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:09,746
They fall apart

966
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:13,150
in odd circumstances.
It always takes a struggle.

967
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:15,762
Or a disaster.

968
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:19,365
But a disaster you're involved in

969
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:20,899
as a victim.

970
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:26,903
Can you envisage a dictatorship
where you're a victim?

971
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,310
We're not under a dictatorship now.

972
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:33,345
She can't envisage being a victim.

973
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:37,542
From a human point of view,
all regimes are equal.

974
01:09:37,707 --> 01:09:39,311
Not better or less good.

975
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,583
Maybe not better, but less bad.

976
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:45,589
It's mind control.

977
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:51,221
The day the press or the movies
are censored

978
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,697
we'd have a dictatorship.
- And if it comes?

979
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,700
It won't.
It would have already.

980
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,361
<i>You're bizarre.</i>

981
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:02,476
<i>Did I say: "Bizarre"?
How bizarre.</i>

982
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:06,272
Women have no civic sense.
They shouldn't, anyway.

983
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:08,746
Shouldn't they?
Why not'?

984
01:10:08,905 --> 01:10:09,815
It's not their concern.

985
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:13,613
Women in politics, who vote...
Ridiculous!

986
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:15,812
That's a 19th century idea.

987
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:19,551
Listen to why they choose
who to vote for!

988
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:23,356
You know,
In a women's workshop

989
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:27,331
if there's a handsome guy,
that's what women see.

990
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:28,901
Laugh, but it's true.

991
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,295
You're not very spoiled.

992
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:34,806
True.
Women don't only go by politics

993
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:38,878
to judge whether a man is capable
of governing well.

994
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,578
Women have...

995
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:43,308
I don't know...
It's a bit...

996
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:45,316
A man's good looks or...

997
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:47,352
Was de Gaulle elected for his looks?

998
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:50,457
That's different. He's...

999
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:52,592
Women in politics
to create a political man,

1000
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,389
women in a political assembly,

1001
01:10:55,551 --> 01:11:00,227
I can't see it: most of them
swear by their friends,

1002
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:04,565
or their husband's opinion,
as we have no secrets.

1003
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:07,867
You know how it is,
living together.

1004
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,010
It's like I often say:

1005
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:13,506
Madam X is friend with Madam Y:

1006
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:16,411
"What do you think of de Gaulle?
Thorez?"

1007
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:18,813
"The late lamented Léon Blum?"

1008
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:21,717
"And Pierre Laval, maybe late as well '?"

1009
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:23,380
And that makes 3 opinions.

1010
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:26,459
2 friends plus <i>2</i> friends
makes 5 friends

1011
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,722
with the same opinions,
who all vote

1012
01:11:29,886 --> 01:11:34,494
with no grasp of politics,
unaware of what's going on.

1013
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,328
You want to know more?

1014
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:40,941
Yes, I think people should know more,

1015
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,640
be better informed.

1016
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:44,743
What do you read in the papers?

1017
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:48,438
That depends on the paper.

1018
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:50,311
"The Adventures of Tintin."

1019
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,350
Which papers do you read?

1020
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,518
I don't read any paper regularly.

1021
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:01,287
"France Soir" for the gossip.

1022
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:04,064
"L'Express," it's well done.

1023
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:07,560
And "Match," "Jour de France."
That's it.

1024
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:10,033
My lofty reading matter.

1025
01:12:10,393 --> 01:12:12,600
What do you read in them?

1026
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:15,799
Gossip in "France Soir"?
And the other papers?

1027
01:12:15,965 --> 01:12:16,943
Don't generalize.

1028
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:19,909
What news struck you most this week'?

1029
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:22,606
Obviously, the Salan trial.

1030
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:27,618
All the papers are full of it.

1031
01:12:27,777 --> 01:12:31,418
Do you feel personally
concerned by it'?

1032
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:35,586
23 May, Law courts

1033
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,670
Let him through.

1034
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:54,608
Wait a minute.

1035
01:12:55,605 --> 01:12:57,812
This isn't a public thoroughfare.

1036
01:12:57,974 --> 01:13:00,454
- Yes, but...
- "Yes, but...!"

1037
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,688
You go in there.

1038
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,760
I'm the examining magistrate!

1039
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:09,362
Indeed!

1040
01:13:10,019 --> 01:13:11,430
Get him!

1041
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:15,701
Are you following what's happening?

1042
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:18,600
- Yes, like everyone else.
- What do you think?

1043
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:21,605
I think as our generals...

1044
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:25,576
were sentenced to death
they should be executed.

1045
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:28,978
But also the Algerians
who killed our men.

1046
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:30,617
Execute all of them?

1047
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:32,081
Or none of them!

1048
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:33,818
Pardon one, pardon all.

1049
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:36,616
That's very extreme.
What do you think?

1050
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:39,953
I'm here to support the guy in the dock.

1051
01:13:40,116 --> 01:13:42,995
I was a paratrooper for 8 years.

1052
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:45,894
Enough people were murdered
in Algeria,

1053
01:13:46,055 --> 01:13:48,057
on the other side by the FLN.

1054
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:51,598
Today we should be sharing his pain.

1055
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:54,469
Besides, Pontius Pilate
is in the Auvergne.

1056
01:13:56,032 --> 01:13:58,012
Can't we put an end to it'?

1057
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,612
There was an end.

1058
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,749
You mentioned fascism,

1059
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:05,044
but I don't think they were fascists.

1060
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:07,551
Communists, maybe.
But nationalists.

1061
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,416
No fighting here.

1062
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,114
Drop it.

1063
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,892
Move along, please.

1064
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,096
Move along.

1065
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,197
23 May, evening of the verdict

1066
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:25,671
You're crazy. Over here!

1067
01:14:26,996 --> 01:14:28,475
What are you doing, Charles?

1068
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,042
Here he is!

1069
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,107
Wait for Goutermanoff.

1070
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,644
We don't know where he is.

1071
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,081
- Wait.
- Don't do this to me.

1072
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:41,220
Pierre, come on.

1073
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:45,821
<i>Then they struck up The Marseillaise ,</i>

1074
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,519
and we couldn't follow the rest.

1075
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:53,031
When they stripped him
of his Légion d'honneur.

1076
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:56,659
Anyway, they'll give it back soon...

1077
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:59,602
But they can't give life back.

1078
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:01,036
Bravo!

1079
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,712
Here's Goutermanoff!

1080
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:08,810
Goutermanoff!

1081
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:13,248
Here comes Gouter!

1082
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:17,714
Same night, at the Garden-Club

1083
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,884
The Madison reaches Paris

1084
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:26,259
3 times!

1085
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:29,797
1... 2... 3.

1086
01:15:32,962 --> 01:15:34,066
Three times!

1087
01:16:09,165 --> 01:16:10,007
16 May, same Garden-Club

1088
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:11,907
Michel Gasty world twist record

1089
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:15,310
What did you think?
Friends? Ideas?

1090
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:16,809
In his 72nd hour

1091
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:18,680
Two things mattered:

1092
01:16:18,841 --> 01:16:22,015
to be able to prove to people

1093
01:16:22,178 --> 01:16:24,988
that although no one encouraged me,

1094
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:28,185
they said I was no good
as I was unknown,

1095
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:33,322
that the way I dance,
my own version is valid.

1096
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:36,101
And as foreigners had always won,

1097
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:39,330
to make my modest contribution
to France.

1098
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:41,072
Individualist and patriot?

1099
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:42,607
Both, yes.

1100
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:45,706
But you must think of things
while dancing?

1101
01:16:45,868 --> 01:16:47,176
- There was...
- Do you?

1102
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:49,612
No. For me, you see...

1103
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:51,752
I'm totally focused.

1104
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:53,784
One can't share many views

1105
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:55,354
so I focus on the twist,

1106
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:56,985
like a scientist on a microbe.

1107
01:16:57,146 --> 01:16:59,626
I focus on the twist microbe.

1108
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:01,159
What does dance mean to you?

1109
01:17:01,317 --> 01:17:03,923
How do you explain it as a need'?

1110
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:06,828
For me, dance replaces

1111
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,696
a repressed emotion.

1112
01:17:08,891 --> 01:17:09,767
Yes?

1113
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:12,303
It's a feeling of friendship,

1114
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:16,040
familiar or something greater...

1115
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:19,645
Sooner or later,

1116
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:22,874
you find this music

1117
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:24,745
transforms you.

1118
01:17:24,907 --> 01:17:27,615
At one stage you lose yourself.

1119
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:30,882
Like last night, I was in a trance.

1120
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:31,990
I couldn't see any more.

1121
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,924
Dancing and dancing,
not knowing where I was.

1122
01:17:35,084 --> 01:17:37,291
I interpret the music.

1123
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,758
Your mind goes blank.

1124
01:17:39,922 --> 01:17:43,096
Your body is completely relaxed.

1125
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:48,038
And any tension you may feel vanishes.

1126
01:17:48,197 --> 01:17:49,198
It replaces a woman.

1127
01:20:27,156 --> 01:20:27,322
29 May, Power strike

1128
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:29,803
29 May, Power strike

1129
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:45,547
I earn 46000 francs a month.

1130
01:20:45,908 --> 01:20:48,445
I pay 8000 francs rent, what's left?

1131
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:53,323
8000 francs for a room.
I make 46000 francs a month.

1132
01:20:53,482 --> 01:20:55,325
If everyone went out on strike

1133
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:59,158
the Government would
have to buckle under.

1134
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:02,035
Can I ask what you earn'?

1135
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:06,901
- How much?
- I take home, all In all,

1136
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:10,839
including bonuses,
42000 francs.

1137
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:12,137
Naturally.

1138
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,610
- I moonlight.
- You moonlight?

1139
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:16,142
It's worth it?

1140
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:20,085
How many hours in all?

1141
01:21:22,578 --> 01:21:25,354
I work 8 hours...
7 here...

1142
01:21:25,514 --> 01:21:27,516
and 8 hours at another job.

1143
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:29,520
Railroad workers are hard hit.

1144
01:21:30,586 --> 01:21:33,066
Starvation wages...

1145
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:35,224
Has your strike had results?

1146
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:37,598
- None.
- Will you strike again?

1147
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:41,100
When we must,
we're ready to stop everything.

1148
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:43,599
Today it's the electricity strike.

1149
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:46,469
- You stand by the railroaders?
- Of course.

1150
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:48,205
How do you see the future?

1151
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:51,010
Not rosy! Not rosy at all!

1152
01:21:51,173 --> 01:21:55,553
You know, I ask myself
how it will all end,

1153
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:59,290
because with those jokers in power...

1154
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:01,223
Trust me!

1155
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:04,159
Yes, I'm going.
Sorry, I have a train!

1156
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:08,430
- No opinions.
- Really?

1157
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,466
No, none.

1158
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:11,535
It came with age? Wisdom?

1159
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:14,173
Yes. I think so.

1160
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:16,633
Did you have opinions at 20'?

1161
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,481
I don't know what to say,
you know...

1162
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:25,079
We can't say that we think.

1163
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,481
You seem disgusted by it all.

1164
01:22:27,643 --> 01:22:30,419
Disgusted?
My poor fellow!

1165
01:22:30,579 --> 01:22:32,991
- It's an opinion.
- Yes, it is.

1166
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:35,185
I am disgusted.

1167
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,626
And I'm certainly not the only one.

1168
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:41,961
After 4 years in the Resistance
I see this!

1169
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:44,364
The month of May, for us in France,

1170
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:46,972
wasn't marked by certain events?

1171
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:49,370
Not to our advantage.

1172
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:51,533
But those events occurred?

1173
01:22:52,401 --> 01:22:53,607
We remember what?

1174
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:56,973
I can't recall
what happened in May.

1175
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:59,415
What's interesting is what remains.

1176
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:03,649
I can't remember the major events.

1177
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:06,959
What marks people is...
The strikes.

1178
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:09,152
Rotating strikes and social unrest.

1179
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:12,231
For you,
is that negative or positive?

1180
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:16,363
Negative in what way?

1181
01:23:16,525 --> 01:23:19,506
A good thing or a bad thing?

1182
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:22,574
It's always the same,
the government is weak,

1183
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:24,369
that's the cause of it.

1184
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,003
No doubt about it.

1185
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:28,739
Strikes shouldn't happen.

1186
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:30,708
Who pays the price?

1187
01:23:31,073 --> 01:23:32,211
The workers.

1188
01:23:32,641 --> 01:23:35,451
Look at my hands, my thumbs.

1189
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:37,454
Look at the state I'm in.

1190
01:23:37,613 --> 01:23:40,150
I'm 60 and I have to keep working.

1191
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:41,760
I can't retire yet.

1192
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:45,155
So a guy gets angry about all this,

1193
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,391
he says: "I'm striking."

1194
01:23:47,556 --> 01:23:49,263
It's all he can do.

1195
01:23:49,424 --> 01:23:52,132
He can't go and fight the boss.

1196
01:23:52,294 --> 01:23:54,103
He says: "I can't eat.

1197
01:23:54,263 --> 01:23:57,073
"I just want to eat,
not be like this.

1198
01:23:57,232 --> 01:24:01,271
"And for my kids..."
Look at my battered shoes...

1199
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:03,780
So you support the people who...

1200
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:06,278
For instance, I say those people

1201
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:09,012
are out on strike for me too.

1202
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:11,623
Just now, you asked...

1203
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:16,559
Even the people who use
trains and subways

1204
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:18,789
understand the situation very well,

1205
01:24:19,154 --> 01:24:21,134
and sympathize with the workers.

1206
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:22,701
So solidarity exists?

1207
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:23,729
It's normal.

1208
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:25,628
- For their demands?
- Right.

1209
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:28,638
Apart from demands, wages and strikes,

1210
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:31,573
was there any other event in May?

1211
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:35,442
The major event
apart from social issues

1212
01:24:35,604 --> 01:24:39,643
was the temperature,
the weather in May.

1213
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,254
- It was unusual?
- Unusual.

1214
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:43,685
And apart from that?

1215
01:24:43,845 --> 01:24:47,486
Other events that...
shouldn't be discussed.

1216
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:49,287
Silence is better?

1217
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:50,429
Isn't it worrying?

1218
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:54,659
In France, politics used to be
the favorite topic.

1219
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:57,303
Now people say:
"Better keep quiet."

1220
01:24:57,459 --> 01:24:58,494
A big change, no?

1221
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:02,107
No, we all think alike.

1222
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,339
I don't think.

1223
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:06,536
- I don't think.
- You don't think?

1224
01:25:06,702 --> 01:25:09,080
It's the ultimate wisdom.

1225
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:11,116
How do you do it?

1226
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:13,116
Well, you know...

1227
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:15,846
Like the Buddhists,
I empty myself.

1228
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:19,215
Confucius said:
"See, hear and say nothing."

1229
01:25:19,381 --> 01:25:21,452
- Exactly.
- You manage to?

1230
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:23,688
It's a bit too noisy.

1231
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:28,329
I'm not talking on your whoring radio.

1232
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,367
It's a whore to the government!

1233
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:32,698
Not a government radio?
C'mon!

1234
01:25:33,095 --> 01:25:37,407
You're all lackeys!
TV, French radio!

1235
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:39,375
He's just doing his job.

1236
01:25:39,534 --> 01:25:43,141
Job my ass!
Now's my chance to have my say.

1237
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:46,751
I say the French are reckless.
We're heading for another war!

1238
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:48,285
Let her go to Russia,

1239
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:49,353
she'll see!

1240
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:52,390
If I could talk Russian, I would!

1241
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:54,493
- You'd come back changed.
- Sure!

1242
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:55,788
Obviously.

1243
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,596
Don't worry about it.

1244
01:25:57,753 --> 01:26:01,428
- Been there?
- You don't need to go there to know it!

1245
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:02,830
I've been to the USA.

1246
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:05,228
- To the USA?
- It's the opposite.

1247
01:26:05,394 --> 01:26:06,304
The opposite.

1248
01:26:06,461 --> 01:26:10,671
Kennedy should look after
his illiterates and jobless first!

1249
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:12,641
It's the same in Russia.
Been there?

1250
01:26:12,801 --> 01:26:16,214
I don't need to go to Russia
to know what's going on.

1251
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:19,909
What was the most important
event in May?

1252
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:23,688
Potatoes went up to 220 francs.

1253
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:26,826
That's a stupendous result.

1254
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,855
And a fantastic event:

1255
01:26:29,217 --> 01:26:31,697
they announced on the radio,

1256
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:35,426
with lots of long speeches,

1257
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:37,797
that no old people would have

1258
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:40,696
less than 11000 francs a month.

1259
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:43,536
It's absolutely terrific:

1260
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:47,169
what a wild time
all those old folk will have

1261
01:26:47,335 --> 01:26:49,440
with 11000 francs a month.

1262
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:52,585
They ended by announcing,
as a victory

1263
01:26:52,741 --> 01:26:56,848
and a sign of France's grandeur,
that in three years time

1264
01:26:57,212 --> 01:27:00,591
no one would have
less than 15000 francs a month.

1265
01:27:00,749 --> 01:27:03,286
I find that simply terrific!

1266
01:27:03,452 --> 01:27:06,899
For myself and everyone else,
the rest is trivial

1267
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:10,429
besides this victory won by the elderly.

1268
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:12,366
What do you expect next?

1269
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:14,734
We always hope for improvement,

1270
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:16,671
especially in labor conditions.

1271
01:27:16,832 --> 01:27:20,575
But it seems to be the man
who struggles who...

1272
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:24,684
And no more strikes,
if possible...

1273
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,615
Governing means foreseeing.

1274
01:27:26,775 --> 01:27:29,688
If we could avoid all that.
And discuss...

1275
01:27:29,845 --> 01:27:31,984
You feel we don't look ahead?

1276
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:35,918
For most people...

1277
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:40,355
The future is a bit like the horizon,
you never reach it.

1278
01:27:40,489 --> 01:27:43,936
It takes 30 years to get there,
then 30 years more.

1279
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:45,771
It's for our children.

1280
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:48,430
Yet something amazing is happening:

1281
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:51,601
the future has a lead on us,

1282
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:54,646
in other words we're late.

1283
01:27:54,803 --> 01:27:57,010
We can't keep up.

1284
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:00,879
Our dreams fall short
of what already exists.

1285
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:05,013
Facts are giving birth
to great revolutions.

1286
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:07,326
We're dreaming of leisure...

1287
01:28:07,482 --> 01:28:10,759
we're dreaming of...
I don't know, many things.

1288
01:28:10,919 --> 01:28:14,958
Reality has overtaken our dreams.

1289
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:19,033
What worries me is
the world ls unaware.

1290
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:23,003
We're unaware.
You look surprised...

1291
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:27,002
Yes, you were saying
what we could do with leisure

1292
01:28:27,369 --> 01:28:30,816
and improvements,
it seemed to be the future...

1293
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:33,976
That's the problem.
Thinking in those terms

1294
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:36,049
means organized leisure,

1295
01:28:36,411 --> 01:28:38,448
back to the old models

1296
01:28:38,613 --> 01:28:41,651
that in '36, consulting engineers

1297
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:44,957
thought through in rational terms.

1298
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,493
The old models persist...

1299
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:51,069
They're still imposed
yet they're irrelevant.

1300
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:53,667
Leisure by definition is non-work.

1301
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:57,477
Can we address non-work
In terms of work?

1302
01:29:02,871 --> 01:29:05,078
I see it more simply.

1303
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:10,446
Gradually machines will bring
automation and automatization.

1304
01:29:10,612 --> 01:29:12,353
We won't quibble over terms.

1305
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:16,394
The 40 hour week will become
a 30 or 25 hour week,

1306
01:29:16,551 --> 01:29:20,431
workers will automatically
have more free time.

1307
01:29:20,589 --> 01:29:22,432
- A serious problem.
- I'm wrong?

1308
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:26,061
You're an example
of the barrier against leisure:

1309
01:29:26,428 --> 01:29:28,430
"Gradually we'll reach 30 hours."

1310
01:29:28,597 --> 01:29:31,077
We could achieve it already.

1311
01:29:31,433 --> 01:29:34,880
We could start
a 30 hour week tomorrow.

1312
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:36,777
The only blocks are moral.

1313
01:29:36,938 --> 01:29:39,646
In many industries we've won

1314
01:29:39,808 --> 01:29:42,414
the fight against scarcity

1315
01:29:42,577 --> 01:29:45,615
that characterized
the 18th and 19th centuries:

1316
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:49,023
if you don't work, you die.

1317
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,864
We've surpassed it in many industries

1318
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:54,830
but we act as if we hadn't.

1319
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:57,061
It's vital to know that

1320
01:29:57,425 --> 01:30:00,599
they could do a 30 hour week
but they don't.

1321
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:05,905
The barrier you mentioned is
that the boss refuses.

1322
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:09,981
- Not the boss...
- Absolutely not.

1323
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:13,585
The average French person refuses,
you and me.

1324
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:16,052
See how reticent you are.

1325
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:17,947
You don't take me seriously?

1326
01:30:18,113 --> 01:30:19,421
I'm not reticent.

1327
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:22,562
I want to work less and rest more.

1328
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:25,789
It's everyone's wish.

1329
01:30:25,954 --> 01:30:27,934
How could we achieve it'?

1330
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:32,769
"Could?"
The conditional tense.

1331
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:34,464
- How can we do it?
- I'm shocked.

1332
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:35,869
What do we do?

1333
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:40,137
How come we're not doing it?

1334
01:30:44,873 --> 01:30:48,582
- Right. That...
- Look...

1335
01:30:48,743 --> 01:30:51,986
That means you don't believe in it.

1336
01:30:52,147 --> 01:30:53,854
- I do. I imagine it.
- But it's real!

1337
01:30:54,015 --> 01:30:55,653
- It's real.
- I imagine it.

1338
01:30:55,817 --> 01:30:58,661
Look out of the window.
At people working.

1339
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:01,891
They're called people working.
Not many laborers.

1340
01:31:02,057 --> 01:31:03,968
What do most people do?

1341
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,503
They add up and subtract,

1342
01:31:06,695 --> 01:31:07,639
statistics, etc.

1343
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:09,969
They're non-productive.
They trade.

1344
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:12,168
Most people in the metro

1345
01:31:12,534 --> 01:31:15,208
aren't manual workers.

1346
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:17,516
They fiddle with data.

1347
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:22,178
We have machines for that now.

1348
01:31:22,544 --> 01:31:25,821
But they're so badly used

1349
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:28,018
it's like they don't exist.

1350
01:31:28,183 --> 01:31:30,823
Only they do exist.
Now people say:

1351
01:31:30,986 --> 01:31:32,932
"Can't we use them better?"

1352
01:31:33,088 --> 01:31:37,195
With each step forward
a structure collapses,

1353
01:31:37,559 --> 01:31:39,197
something obsolete emerges.

1354
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:45,836
So if I understand rightly,
quite soon...

1355
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:46,911
Yes, I believe it.

1356
01:31:47,068 --> 01:31:51,483
Machines will cause non-productive
people to lose their jobs.

1357
01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:53,641
No, lose their prestige.

1358
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:57,017
- No prestige or no job?
- A structural problem.

1359
01:31:57,178 --> 01:32:00,489
Or we invent jobs for them.
But no prestige.

1360
01:32:00,648 --> 01:32:02,992
They believe in their work.

1361
01:32:03,151 --> 01:32:06,826
But once machines do it better,
they can't believe.

1362
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:12,262
Gas and electricity users
felt cheated

1363
01:32:12,627 --> 01:32:14,163
by perforated cards.

1364
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:17,271
They felt
they couldn't check their bill.

1365
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:18,838
They never used to check it.

1366
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,210
If machines take over,
might we lose the plot

1367
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:25,573
and not understand at all?

1368
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,879
That's another problem.

1369
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:30,284
Perhaps the future world

1370
01:32:30,645 --> 01:32:34,889
will be split into two highly
contrasting groups:

1371
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:37,189
the initiated and the non-initiated.

1372
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:39,532
It's obviously a problem.

1373
01:32:56,337 --> 01:33:01,150
Isn't it it connected
to politics and economics?

1374
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:04,813
No, as we're still within the structures

1375
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:07,016
of a poverty-driven economy,

1376
01:33:07,182 --> 01:33:08,718
based on scarcity.

1377
01:33:08,883 --> 01:33:10,658
How can we break free'?

1378
01:33:10,819 --> 01:33:12,992
I think it will all explode.

1379
01:33:13,154 --> 01:33:15,964
There's a big obstacle:
the Third World.

1380
01:33:16,124 --> 01:33:19,003
Today we obviously can't imagine

1381
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,936
buying a third or fourth fridge

1382
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:25,772
knowing a whole population
is starving to death.

1383
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:30,041
We know we have the biochemical
means, if we want to,

1384
01:33:30,205 --> 01:33:33,152
to feed the whole planet quite easily.

1385
01:33:33,308 --> 01:33:37,188
So it's not a technical problem.
It's a moral one.

1386
01:33:37,345 --> 01:33:39,985
Technique can free mankind.

1387
01:33:40,148 --> 01:33:43,322
Why don't we want to be free?
I can't answer that.

1388
01:33:44,052 --> 01:33:44,118
Are freedom and independence

1389
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:46,599
Are freedom and independence

1390
01:33:46,754 --> 01:33:48,324
also temptations from the West?

1391
01:33:48,823 --> 01:33:50,325
To abandon African values

1392
01:33:50,692 --> 01:33:53,832
for the European values
of a technical civilization?

1393
01:33:53,995 --> 01:33:59,308
A lot of Europeans and teachers say so.

1394
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:01,874
They claim that

1395
01:34:02,036 --> 01:34:06,007
the contact
between Africans and Europeans

1396
01:34:06,174 --> 01:34:09,883
introduced Africans to various things

1397
01:34:10,044 --> 01:34:13,389
that represent happiness
for Europeans.

1398
01:34:13,748 --> 01:34:16,194
So they want them too.

1399
01:34:16,351 --> 01:34:19,992
For instance, a refrigerator
ls a sign of civilization.

1400
01:34:20,388 --> 01:34:22,299
A washing machine, and so on.

1401
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:25,031
25 May, Paris Fair

1402
01:34:37,005 --> 01:34:39,713
A perfect finish.

1403
01:34:39,874 --> 01:34:43,321
It's a simply fabulous

1404
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,248
household appliance.

1405
01:34:47,749 --> 01:34:52,129
There's a drawer underneath.
In steel, vitrified at 900°.

1406
01:34:52,287 --> 01:34:57,794
You know because you've got one.
The enamel won't budge.

1407
01:34:59,227 --> 01:35:01,730
Can I help you, madam?

1408
01:35:04,999 --> 01:35:06,979
Which cooker?

1409
01:35:07,135 --> 01:35:08,808
We have 3 models.

1410
01:35:08,970 --> 01:35:13,749
One without a timer,
this one with a timer.

1411
01:35:13,975 --> 01:35:18,424
Can I ask what you'll do
with that tube?

1412
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:21,124
Keep it as a souvenir
of the Paris Fair.

1413
01:35:21,316 --> 01:35:23,887
Turn it into a blowpipe for my son.

1414
01:35:24,085 --> 01:35:26,190
Give it to my dad.
He'll find a use for it.

1415
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:28,264
Haven't a clue.

1416
01:35:28,423 --> 01:35:29,902
No idea?

1417
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:32,060
I chose the small ones.

1418
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:34,707
Necklaces for the little Negroes
in Madagascar.

1419
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:36,239
I'm into DIY.

1420
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:40,209
I have <i>2</i> lengths of rubber.

1421
01:35:40,368 --> 01:35:42,279
I'll cut them.

1422
01:35:42,437 --> 01:35:44,007
And put them on the ends.

1423
01:35:44,172 --> 01:35:46,083
Then I'll have a tube.

1424
01:35:46,241 --> 01:35:49,415
You have lots of things,
including a gas jet element.

1425
01:35:49,777 --> 01:35:52,951
Yes, with a gallon...

1426
01:35:53,114 --> 01:35:55,116
What do you think of the French?

1427
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:57,489
The French?

1428
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:07,806
At first, when I was very young,

1429
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:11,239
my grandma always said:
"Watch out for the French."

1430
01:36:12,867 --> 01:36:16,314
She told me to be wary of the French

1431
01:36:16,471 --> 01:36:20,942
because she'd been through
a lot of humiliation

1432
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:23,453
and things...

1433
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:27,988
to do with colonization.

1434
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:30,925
So she'd say:
"Watch out for the French."

1435
01:36:31,085 --> 01:36:34,965
When my father decided to send me
to France, she said no way.

1436
01:36:35,123 --> 01:36:39,230
She'd always been against it.
She didn't want me to go.

1437
01:36:39,394 --> 01:36:43,501
It was understandable
as she'd educated us.

1438
01:36:44,299 --> 01:36:48,839
- At what age did you come to France?
- 13 or 14.

1439
01:36:49,003 --> 01:36:50,346
Your first impression?

1440
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:56,820
To be honest...

1441
01:36:56,978 --> 01:37:00,425
the first time I saw a Frenchman here,

1442
01:37:00,581 --> 01:37:03,858
I thought:
"They're the ones who beat us."

1443
01:37:04,018 --> 01:37:05,326
That's the first thing.

1444
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:07,898
"So they're the ones who beat us."

1445
01:37:08,890 --> 01:37:11,097
That's the first thing.

1446
01:37:11,259 --> 01:37:14,035
- The second thing?
- The second thing?

1447
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:17,376
"We can beat them now!"

1448
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:21,177
Me, at first,

1449
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:25,580
I thought when you talked
about France,

1450
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:28,819
that all whites were French.

1451
01:37:28,976 --> 01:37:30,956
All whites were French.

1452
01:37:31,112 --> 01:37:34,423
I knew there were Americans,

1453
01:37:34,582 --> 01:37:38,052
we called them Yankees, in fact.

1454
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:41,428
Then there were the Germains,

1455
01:37:41,589 --> 01:37:43,330
who were next door.

1456
01:37:43,491 --> 01:37:44,526
And then, the English.

1457
01:37:44,892 --> 01:37:48,999
Apart than that, there was no one.

1458
01:37:49,163 --> 01:37:51,871
They rammed that idea into our heads.

1459
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:57,449
And they were most powerful,
the most civilized.

1460
01:37:58,139 --> 01:38:00,346
So I came to France

1461
01:38:00,508 --> 01:38:04,081
and I saw Paris.

1462
01:38:04,245 --> 01:38:08,489
I saw Paris at night,
with the lights and all.

1463
01:38:08,649 --> 01:38:11,562
I thought it was beautiful.

1464
01:38:11,919 --> 01:38:14,263
I looked at the French with curiosity,

1465
01:38:14,422 --> 01:38:16,959
all the whites that I met.

1466
01:38:17,125 --> 01:38:18,536
They were very ordinary,

1467
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:22,340
totally unlike the ones I'd seen

1468
01:38:22,497 --> 01:38:25,137
and met in Africa.

1469
01:38:25,299 --> 01:38:27,336
Not at all the same.

1470
01:38:27,502 --> 01:38:29,038
They were rather simple.

1471
01:38:29,203 --> 01:38:31,945
And the ones you saw in Africa'?

1472
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:34,650
We didn't touch them or see them.

1473
01:38:35,009 --> 01:38:38,149
They were distant.

1474
01:38:38,312 --> 01:38:42,488
The white man was the governor,
for me.

1475
01:38:42,650 --> 01:38:46,598
When he arrived, like it or not,

1476
01:38:46,954 --> 01:38:48,365
you had to get into line

1477
01:38:48,523 --> 01:38:51,231
and parade past him

1478
01:38:51,392 --> 01:38:54,339
to the sound of bugles, etc.

1479
01:38:54,495 --> 01:38:58,466
He'd pin things on the old men

1480
01:38:58,633 --> 01:39:02,513
who'd behaved well.
Stuff like that.

1481
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:06,049
So I found them simple over here.

1482
01:39:06,207 --> 01:39:08,949
But I was wary.

1483
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:10,589
Always on my guard.

1484
01:39:11,579 --> 01:39:16,688
Then my uncle,
who is very Christian,

1485
01:39:17,051 --> 01:39:20,225
sent me to the Christian Brothers.

1486
01:39:21,255 --> 01:39:23,428
In Africa,

1487
01:39:23,591 --> 01:39:26,697
the priests...

1488
01:39:28,095 --> 01:39:31,372
I knew how they were because...

1489
01:39:33,201 --> 01:39:36,148
I'd seen how it all worked.

1490
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:40,081
For instance, there were comrades
who went to the mission,

1491
01:39:40,241 --> 01:39:41,652
to learn catechism,

1492
01:39:42,009 --> 01:39:46,151
although they went more
to learn to read and write.

1493
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:48,487
And they were put through catechism.

1494
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:50,060
No way round it.

1495
01:39:50,218 --> 01:39:54,325
But when they attend
our traditional ceremonies

1496
01:39:54,489 --> 01:39:57,129
and go to confession,
they confess it.

1497
01:39:57,291 --> 01:40:00,636
As it was forbidden...
Our things are the devil.

1498
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:02,997
The devil is hell.

1499
01:40:03,164 --> 01:40:05,371
They converted, in my opinion,

1500
01:40:05,533 --> 01:40:07,410
because they'd been told:

1501
01:40:07,568 --> 01:40:12,642
"You'll all burn in eternal hell
or go to heaven."

1502
01:40:13,608 --> 01:40:14,609
That's how I see it.

1503
01:40:14,775 --> 01:40:16,652
That's why I said

1504
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:20,117
if it's to go to heaven or to hell,

1505
01:40:20,281 --> 01:40:22,727
reneging on my ancestors' beliefs...

1506
01:40:23,084 --> 01:40:27,590
My ancestors believed in them
so they went to hell.

1507
01:40:27,755 --> 01:40:30,497
I'm told if I do, I'll go to hell.

1508
01:40:30,658 --> 01:40:32,228
So my ancestors went to hell.

1509
01:40:32,393 --> 01:40:35,533
I'd rather go to hell with my ancestors

1510
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:39,041
than to heaven with whoever!

1511
01:40:40,434 --> 01:40:44,143
I prefer that hell.

1512
01:40:44,305 --> 01:40:46,717
And the priests...

1513
01:40:47,074 --> 01:40:50,214
So you came to the priests here?

1514
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:54,087
They seemed very different
from priests in Africa.

1515
01:40:54,248 --> 01:40:56,319
When you attended
your ceremonies there

1516
01:40:56,484 --> 01:41:00,660
you confessed
that you'd attended a ceremony,

1517
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:03,324
a spirit dance,

1518
01:41:03,491 --> 01:41:06,028
and they gave you a beating.

1519
01:41:06,193 --> 01:41:10,664
With those bats. Very hard.

1520
01:41:10,831 --> 01:41:15,177
The Brothers here were nice
and made a good impression on me.

1521
01:41:15,336 --> 01:41:18,442
I was okay with them.

1522
01:41:18,606 --> 01:41:21,052
I only fought with them once,

1523
01:41:21,208 --> 01:41:22,619
about our history.

1524
01:41:22,777 --> 01:41:25,656
There was a passage saying

1525
01:41:25,813 --> 01:41:28,726
the French had come to Dahomey

1526
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:32,189
and had crushed Behanzin,

1527
01:41:32,353 --> 01:41:36,824
a bloodthirsty, petty monarch.

1528
01:41:37,191 --> 01:41:41,298
I tore the book apart!

1529
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:48,138
I tore the book apart,
I yelled and walked out.

1530
01:41:48,302 --> 01:41:52,341
They said history was like that,
and I had to learn it.

1531
01:41:52,506 --> 01:41:54,850
I said: "Really?"
I was furious!

1532
01:41:55,209 --> 01:41:59,817
I said: "One day we'll free ourselves,
and then you'll see!

1533
01:42:00,181 --> 01:42:02,161
"You have planes?
We'll build planes too.

1534
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:08,631
"One day, you'll see a plane in the sky
with a kind of cross on it."

1535
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:11,125
I was young.

1536
01:42:11,292 --> 01:42:14,296
But it contradicted

1537
01:42:14,462 --> 01:42:18,274
the history my grandma had taught me.

1538
01:42:18,432 --> 01:42:22,847
She told us how our ancestors
had defended themselves,

1539
01:42:23,204 --> 01:42:27,584
how the French hadn't conquered
Dahomey overnight.

1540
01:42:27,742 --> 01:42:31,212
It wasn't easy for the French.

1541
01:42:31,379 --> 01:42:33,859
I love our history
and they tell me that!

1542
01:42:34,215 --> 01:42:36,217
It's the only time I lost my temper.

1543
01:42:36,384 --> 01:42:39,627
Then they sent me to the Massif Central.

1544
01:42:39,787 --> 01:42:41,733
And the people there

1545
01:42:41,889 --> 01:42:45,666
had virtually never seen a black man.

1546
01:42:45,826 --> 01:42:50,741
They'd say: "Oh, look at the Negro!"
Things like that.

1547
01:42:50,898 --> 01:42:53,572
Sometimes it made us angry.

1548
01:42:53,734 --> 01:42:57,546
We were very touchy.
There were fist-fights.

1549
01:42:57,705 --> 01:43:01,653
In the end, me and my friends
stayed there 3 years.

1550
01:43:01,809 --> 01:43:04,847
- They stopped pointing at us.
- They got used to it?

1551
01:43:05,212 --> 01:43:06,919
Yes, they got used to it.

1552
01:43:07,281 --> 01:43:10,285
- And you got used to it'?
- To what?

1553
01:43:10,451 --> 01:43:14,297
Seeing whites
you hadn't really seen before.

1554
01:43:14,455 --> 01:43:17,402
I had, but we weren't integrated.

1555
01:43:17,558 --> 01:43:19,299
I wasn't integrated.

1556
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:21,371
I'm no more integrated now.

1557
01:43:21,529 --> 01:43:25,170
I had a Chinese friend who said:

1558
01:43:25,332 --> 01:43:28,404
"At last we've civilized them.

1559
01:43:28,569 --> 01:43:30,879
"They don't point at us anymore."

1560
01:43:31,238 --> 01:43:33,775
That was my notion of white people.

1561
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:36,512
You had white friends afterwards?

1562
01:43:36,977 --> 01:43:40,948
I had a few,
who invited me to their homes.

1563
01:43:41,315 --> 01:43:45,457
Usually out of sympathy,
or to show

1564
01:43:45,619 --> 01:43:48,657
they weren't racist
and had no prejudices.

1565
01:43:48,823 --> 01:43:50,302
Apart from that

1566
01:43:50,458 --> 01:43:52,699
did you have real white friends?

1567
01:43:58,365 --> 01:43:59,435
10 May, Champs-Elysées

1568
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:03,241
Do relationships need disguise,
dressing up'?

1569
01:44:03,704 --> 01:44:06,583
No, they're not extras to add on,

1570
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:09,813
like we saw earlier with the coatstand.

1571
01:44:09,977 --> 01:44:12,890
On the contrary,
they correspond to

1572
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,725
an aspect of ourselves.

1573
01:44:14,882 --> 01:44:16,793
We can't always live it out.

1574
01:44:16,951 --> 01:44:21,491
But dressing up permits this.
It accentuates our self.

1575
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:25,829
I don't know,
I love magical things.

1576
01:44:25,993 --> 01:44:28,803
So I wear flowing gowns,

1577
01:44:28,963 --> 01:44:31,807
incredible hats...

1578
01:44:31,966 --> 01:44:36,813
It's to do with ceremony too,
I don't know...

1579
01:44:36,971 --> 01:44:39,918
Where are the ceremonial places?

1580
01:44:40,274 --> 01:44:41,844
When are the ceremonial moments?

1581
01:44:42,009 --> 01:44:44,512
For me, ceremonial moments

1582
01:44:46,347 --> 01:44:50,557
are when I get ready
for something special...

1583
01:44:50,718 --> 01:44:54,393
Like going to a restaurant.
I love preparing for it.

1584
01:44:54,555 --> 01:44:56,364
I go to a special restaurant,

1585
01:44:56,524 --> 01:45:00,028
where I know
I'll eat a special dish I'll enjoy.

1586
01:45:00,394 --> 01:45:03,568
I must get ready first.
It's part of the ceremony.

1587
01:45:03,731 --> 01:45:06,302
It's a very private thing.

1588
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:10,916
A moment locked in time

1589
01:45:11,071 --> 01:45:13,915
when I imagine
everything will be beautiful.

1590
01:45:14,074 --> 01:45:16,554
Sometimes it doesn't work out...

1591
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:18,553
But it's exciting.

1592
01:45:18,712 --> 01:45:19,918
Getting ready.

1593
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:23,618
So preparing for something
is a ceremony.

1594
01:45:23,818 --> 01:45:25,855
I love escaping,

1595
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:29,729
everything that takes me
out of reality,

1596
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:32,928
everyday reality, the routine.

1597
01:45:33,093 --> 01:45:34,401
For instance,

1598
01:45:34,595 --> 01:45:37,337
I can feel when routine takes over.

1599
01:45:37,498 --> 01:45:39,808
Say when you're with someone...

1600
01:45:39,967 --> 01:45:43,676
The opposite of routine is enthusiasm.

1601
01:45:44,338 --> 01:45:46,841
When the enthusiasm fades

1602
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:49,453
you start using words that are dead,

1603
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:54,025
that stifle you like ash burying you.

1604
01:45:54,381 --> 01:45:56,691
So you must react, shake it up.

1605
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:59,593
You have to dive into yourself

1606
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:02,999
and recreate,
reinvent almost everything.

1607
01:46:03,791 --> 01:46:07,068
To escape from those dead things
that crush you.

1608
01:46:08,062 --> 01:46:11,635
It's very hard.
You don't always succeed.

1609
01:46:11,799 --> 01:46:13,972
Sometimes things die anyway.

1610
01:46:15,436 --> 01:46:17,473
We're not always capable of...

1611
01:46:21,442 --> 01:46:22,614
And animals?

1612
01:46:22,810 --> 01:46:25,984
Animals? I'd love to have lots.

1613
01:46:26,146 --> 01:46:30,959
Animals reconcile me
to the rest of the world.

1614
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:34,463
I'm solitary as I'm scared
of people's cruelty,

1615
01:46:34,622 --> 01:46:36,624
of what they think,

1616
01:46:37,024 --> 01:46:39,436
of vulgarity, things like that.

1617
01:46:39,593 --> 01:46:42,472
So I'm very alone,
I out myself off.

1618
01:46:42,630 --> 01:46:44,576
I lose out on a lot too.

1619
01:46:44,732 --> 01:46:48,646
But I'm so scared
of being hurt by it all

1620
01:46:48,802 --> 01:46:49,940
that I'm very solitary.

1621
01:46:50,104 --> 01:46:54,143
Animals really do act
as a buffer between people.

1622
01:46:54,508 --> 01:46:56,681
I'm reconciled to the world

1623
01:46:56,844 --> 01:46:59,120
through their sweetness.

1624
01:46:59,813 --> 01:47:00,848
There...

1625
01:47:01,582 --> 01:47:03,152
Isn't she pretty.

1626
01:47:09,757 --> 01:47:11,065
Let's try another one.

1627
01:47:11,425 --> 01:47:13,803
And she likes it.
She doesn't complain.

1628
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:15,998
She feels proud.

1629
01:47:16,964 --> 01:47:19,001
She looks like Alcave.

1630
01:47:22,569 --> 01:47:25,743
Cats are amazing.
They make you want to...

1631
01:47:25,906 --> 01:47:28,443
They're stylish by nature.

1632
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:30,555
This one is really...

1633
01:47:30,711 --> 01:47:33,055
This is my favorite hat for her.

1634
01:47:34,481 --> 01:47:39,453
It's a fantastic hat:
cheeky, very feminine.

1635
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:41,566
It's a role.

1636
01:47:42,122 --> 01:47:43,624
She's playing Cocteau.

1637
01:47:43,891 --> 01:47:46,599
Do you feel privileged?

1638
01:47:48,862 --> 01:47:51,536
- As you're beautiful, say?
- I'm healthy,

1639
01:47:51,732 --> 01:47:53,643
and not too ugly, yes.

1640
01:47:53,801 --> 01:47:57,214
I didn't have 10 children,
limits like that.

1641
01:47:57,571 --> 01:48:01,519
Which would make me
get more involved.

1642
01:48:01,675 --> 01:48:05,680
By that I mean going one way,
eliminating the others.

1643
01:48:05,846 --> 01:48:09,726
I don't like that, as I'm too curious
about everything.

1644
01:48:09,883 --> 01:48:12,864
- You don't want to...
- No, not at all.

1645
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:16,968
What's terrible is that I refuse
to commit to anything.

1646
01:48:18,826 --> 01:48:23,104
Imagine someone
who won't follow any direction:

1647
01:48:23,497 --> 01:48:24,475
he ends up a tramp.

1648
01:48:24,631 --> 01:48:25,939
I could too, easily.

1649
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:30,048
I don't know...
It haunts me.

1650
01:48:30,204 --> 01:48:33,913
Do you accept death
or do you refuse it?

1651
01:48:34,975 --> 01:48:36,955
I don't accept it at all!

1652
01:48:38,145 --> 01:48:42,491
It's awful sometimes,
I think of the moment we die,

1653
01:48:42,649 --> 01:48:45,892
the instant we hear our last breath.

1654
01:48:46,053 --> 01:48:50,092
I start crying for days on end,
it's so awful.

1655
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:55,606
- Are you very religious?
- No, not very.

1656
01:48:55,763 --> 01:48:58,903
- Do you have faith?
- Yes, I have faith.

1657
01:49:00,034 --> 01:49:04,005
For me,
God gives mankind meaning.

1658
01:49:04,905 --> 01:49:08,045
Our attitude should be influenced by it.

1659
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:12,816
We don't have the right
to hate mankind if God created it.

1660
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:16,860
That's easy for believers.

1661
01:49:17,017 --> 01:49:20,863
And what about the people

1662
01:49:21,021 --> 01:49:23,592
for whom God is meaningless?

1663
01:49:23,757 --> 01:49:25,100
What then?

1664
01:49:25,592 --> 01:49:29,165
You say you have faith,
so you chose an attitude.

1665
01:49:29,329 --> 01:49:30,672
How do you express it?

1666
01:49:32,966 --> 01:49:34,912
I don't.

1667
01:49:35,069 --> 01:49:38,016
- Doesn't that bother you?
- Of course it does.

1668
01:49:39,339 --> 01:49:41,910
That's why it's very difficult.

1669
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:43,911
Right.

1670
01:49:44,078 --> 01:49:47,287
So for you,
mankind is abstract,

1671
01:49:47,681 --> 01:49:51,823
thinking about it gives you...

1672
01:49:51,985 --> 01:49:55,956
I don't know, confidence,
a sort of...

1673
01:49:57,958 --> 01:50:01,963
For instance,
we filmed at Renault this summer.

1674
01:50:02,129 --> 01:50:05,133
Some workers were only striking

1675
01:50:05,299 --> 01:50:08,041
because the workshops were too noisy.

1676
01:50:08,235 --> 01:50:13,184
Conditions in Billancourt
aren't the same as in Paris.

1677
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:14,819
People suffer.

1678
01:50:15,742 --> 01:50:17,346
Do you feel concerned?

1679
01:50:19,079 --> 01:50:21,025
Concerned but useless.

1680
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:25,787
Communists, who are atheists,

1681
01:50:25,953 --> 01:50:28,365
have found a meaning to humanity.

1682
01:50:28,722 --> 01:50:31,601
But between believers and communists...

1683
01:50:31,758 --> 01:50:32,998
- It's lukewarm.
- A mass.

1684
01:50:33,827 --> 01:50:37,604
- Some communists have faith.
- They shouldn't exist.

1685
01:50:37,764 --> 01:50:40,677
So there are believers and communists?

1686
01:50:40,834 --> 01:50:42,108
They all believe.

1687
01:50:42,803 --> 01:50:48,651
Who do you think
are getting it right now?

1688
01:50:48,809 --> 01:50:50,789
- For who?
- People who suffer.

1689
01:50:50,944 --> 01:50:55,324
Who offers the best response
to mankind's expectations?

1690
01:50:57,050 --> 01:50:58,654
The communists.

1691
01:50:58,819 --> 01:51:03,928
I think the communists
are much more active.

1692
01:51:04,091 --> 01:51:07,004
More committed than the Christians.

1693
01:51:07,161 --> 01:51:09,334
The spirit is different.

1694
01:51:10,731 --> 01:51:13,337
There's no spirit of revenge

1695
01:51:15,435 --> 01:51:19,781
or hatred in religion,
no anger.

1696
01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:22,113
Communism is against something.

1697
01:51:22,276 --> 01:51:26,281
You must destroy
before you can be active.

1698
01:51:26,446 --> 01:51:29,893
I feel when you talk about Christianity

1699
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:33,862
you see its highest and most noble form.

1700
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:39,334
Whereas with communism,
you see its lowest form: anger.

1701
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:41,229
Yes, but it works for it.

1702
01:51:41,395 --> 01:51:43,932
Are there angry Christians
and noble communists?

1703
01:51:45,299 --> 01:51:47,404
Among the best of them, yes.

1704
01:51:47,801 --> 01:51:51,339
- No, Catherine.
- What sort of Christians?

1705
01:51:51,738 --> 01:51:54,378
- The best ones, of course.
- So?

1706
01:51:57,344 --> 01:52:00,382
For me, communism represents...

1707
01:52:01,014 --> 01:52:03,790
it's hard to sum up in a few words...

1708
01:52:03,951 --> 01:52:07,763
My reason to live
and my hope for the future.

1709
01:52:07,921 --> 01:52:09,457
I don't hide it.

1710
01:52:12,059 --> 01:52:16,007
In the beginning,
were you opposed to the communists?

1711
01:52:16,797 --> 01:52:21,906
I had some objections at first.

1712
01:52:22,069 --> 01:52:23,912
What did you tell them?

1713
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:28,451
Obviously the main objection

1714
01:52:28,809 --> 01:52:32,052
back in 1946 or 1947,

1715
01:52:32,212 --> 01:52:35,159
that sprang to my lips and my mind,

1716
01:52:35,315 --> 01:52:39,024
was that communism was atheist
and I was a believer.

1717
01:52:39,186 --> 01:52:42,793
Communists were proud
of being atheists.

1718
01:52:42,956 --> 01:52:47,029
The world they wanted to build
was without God,

1719
01:52:47,194 --> 01:52:50,300
a world built by men for men.

1720
01:52:50,464 --> 01:52:53,775
When I saw in their conversations

1721
01:52:53,934 --> 01:52:56,744
and actions how these comrades,

1722
01:52:56,903 --> 01:52:58,075
without God,

1723
01:52:58,238 --> 01:53:02,152
simply by their own strength
and ambition,

1724
01:53:02,309 --> 01:53:06,052
their will, work and efforts,

1725
01:53:06,213 --> 01:53:07,988
aimed to change the world,

1726
01:53:08,148 --> 01:53:11,288
when I saw that communism
was the communists,

1727
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:15,331
it was easier for me
to set arguments aside

1728
01:53:15,489 --> 01:53:17,765
and engage in brotherly action.

1729
01:53:19,126 --> 01:53:21,936
You came to communism
through the unions?

1730
01:53:22,095 --> 01:53:24,507
You're a militant union member now?

1731
01:53:24,865 --> 01:53:28,403
How did you get involved in the unions'?

1732
01:53:28,568 --> 01:53:33,813
A militant came up to me,

1733
01:53:35,442 --> 01:53:40,323
I can see it now,
at the canteen exit.

1734
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:44,451
He knew or he'd just heard
that I was a priest,

1735
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:48,391
and I'd come to work in the factory.

1736
01:53:48,555 --> 01:53:51,229
This surprised him.

1737
01:53:51,391 --> 01:53:54,463
He was a CGT militant,
he couldn't imagine

1738
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:57,832
that a priest, with no ulterior motive,

1739
01:53:57,998 --> 01:54:02,572
would come to share
the working conditions and lives

1740
01:54:02,936 --> 01:54:05,143
of all his comrades.

1741
01:54:05,305 --> 01:54:06,579
His first feeling

1742
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:11,184
was certainly distrust.

1743
01:54:11,345 --> 01:54:13,347
But he offered me a union card:

1744
01:54:13,513 --> 01:54:15,959
"Do you want to join the CGT?"

1745
01:54:16,116 --> 01:54:18,289
I'd already thought about it.

1746
01:54:18,452 --> 01:54:20,159
I said yes.

1747
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:23,028
So since 1946,

1748
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:26,194
I've been a militant CGT member.

1749
01:54:26,393 --> 01:54:29,135
But the fundamental problem

1750
01:54:29,296 --> 01:54:34,837
wasn't simply working like my comrades.

1751
01:54:35,001 --> 01:54:37,311
The problem for the militants around me

1752
01:54:37,471 --> 01:54:40,611
was to know if
I was sharing their struggle.

1753
01:54:40,974 --> 01:54:43,215
Did I have a union card

1754
01:54:43,377 --> 01:54:46,950
with no ulterior motives,
was I genuine?

1755
01:54:47,114 --> 01:54:50,584
Had I accepted
to join my life with theirs,

1756
01:54:50,951 --> 01:54:53,932
to join my fight,

1757
01:54:54,087 --> 01:54:58,866
my personal demands,
with their fight?

1758
01:54:59,025 --> 01:55:00,470
In all honesty,

1759
01:55:00,627 --> 01:55:04,234
without the Church telling me one day:

1760
01:55:04,398 --> 01:55:09,609
"That's enough, come back
to the bosom of the Church now.

1761
01:55:09,970 --> 01:55:11,972
"The experiment is over."

1762
01:55:12,139 --> 01:55:15,120
That's why, since 1946,

1763
01:55:15,275 --> 01:55:18,984
I was determined
to make it not an experiment,

1764
01:55:19,146 --> 01:55:21,922
but my life.

1765
01:55:22,115 --> 01:55:24,356
That's the core of the problem:

1766
01:55:24,518 --> 01:55:27,431
The Church wanted to experiment,

1767
01:55:27,587 --> 01:55:33,094
hoping we'd stop short
of any compromise

1768
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:37,265
or too deep an involvement
in the struggle.

1769
01:55:37,431 --> 01:55:41,573
But gradually
the transformation took place.

1770
01:55:41,935 --> 01:55:44,916
I had to make the break.
To choose.

1771
01:55:45,071 --> 01:55:47,051
Worker or priest.

1772
01:55:47,207 --> 01:55:49,448
Being both was unthinkable:

1773
01:55:49,609 --> 01:55:53,557
engaging in the struggle
and remaining in the Church.

1774
01:55:53,713 --> 01:55:57,456
- You made your choice?
- Yes.

1775
01:55:57,617 --> 01:56:00,655
When the Church asked us

1776
01:56:01,021 --> 01:56:02,523
in 1953

1777
01:56:02,689 --> 01:56:06,637
to choose the Church
or the workers' struggle,

1778
01:56:06,993 --> 01:56:11,203
out of loyalty to my union card in 1946,

1779
01:56:11,364 --> 01:56:13,935
I preferred to remain a worker

1780
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:16,706
and participate daily,

1781
01:56:17,070 --> 01:56:19,209
for the rest of my life,

1782
01:56:19,406 --> 01:56:22,319
in the workers' struggle.

1783
01:56:22,476 --> 01:56:25,355
Did your faith include transcendency?

1784
01:56:25,512 --> 01:56:27,514
In 1946, yes.

1785
01:56:27,681 --> 01:56:31,424
- Are you detached from it now?
- Totally.

1786
01:56:31,585 --> 01:56:34,395
Is it too personal to ask how'?

1787
01:56:34,554 --> 01:56:37,034
It was a very gradual process.

1788
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:40,399
It was very gradual and I think...

1789
01:56:40,594 --> 01:56:44,337
I don't say it's necessary
for a militant,

1790
01:56:44,498 --> 01:56:48,446
but it became a conviction.

1791
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:53,576
I'm so caught up in what's essential,

1792
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:56,220
I'm convinced

1793
01:56:56,376 --> 01:57:01,985
society has to change
so men can be happier...

1794
01:57:02,148 --> 01:57:05,095
This may sound rather brutal:

1795
01:57:05,252 --> 01:57:09,997
I don't have time to bother
about God or whether He exists.

1796
01:57:10,357 --> 01:57:14,134
<i>The Morning of The Magicians
says Christ was</i> a <i>mutant.</i>

1797
01:57:14,761 --> 01:57:18,265
- Have you read it'?
- I've skimmed through it.

1798
01:57:18,465 --> 01:57:20,342
- The interesting bits.
- Which?

1799
01:57:21,101 --> 01:57:25,743
If there's life on other planets,
knowing what they think.

1800
01:57:31,344 --> 01:57:35,588
<i>In May 1962, the dream
is served up ready-made.</i>

1801
01:57:42,222 --> 01:57:46,693
<i>For many Parisians,
TV is their only window onto the world.</i>

1802
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:51,270
<i>The smaller the house,
the more vital the window.</i>

1803
01:57:51,665 --> 01:57:56,774
20 May, shantytown
on the outskirts of Paris

1804
01:58:36,776 --> 01:58:37,109
You've studied?

1805
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:38,714
You've studied?

1806
01:58:38,878 --> 01:58:43,156
Up until technical school,
eleventh grade.

1807
01:58:43,283 --> 01:58:44,421
Yes?

1808
01:58:44,584 --> 01:58:46,791
Eleventh grade.

1809
01:58:47,153 --> 01:58:48,860
Then you started working?

1810
01:58:49,222 --> 01:58:50,826
Yes, last year.

1811
01:58:51,191 --> 01:58:52,568
Your first job?

1812
01:58:53,593 --> 01:58:55,595
Your impressions of that plant?

1813
01:58:55,762 --> 01:58:58,709
I stayed a week in my first plant.

1814
01:59:02,268 --> 01:59:06,410
When I applied, I said:
"I have my skilled workers certificate.

1815
01:59:06,573 --> 01:59:11,454
"I saw your ad for P1 skilled turners.

1816
01:59:11,611 --> 01:59:15,559
"I'm not P1 but I have the equivalent.

1817
01:59:15,715 --> 01:59:18,218
"I can do a test, if you like."

1818
01:59:18,385 --> 01:59:20,626
So they agreed to give me a test.

1819
01:59:20,787 --> 01:59:23,791
It went well. I had a 16/20 grade.

1820
01:59:24,157 --> 01:59:25,602
It went very well.

1821
01:59:25,759 --> 01:59:27,500
So they hired me.

1822
01:59:27,661 --> 01:59:30,437
I had a good salary.

1823
01:59:30,597 --> 01:59:35,137
- The problem was...
- How much did you earn?

1824
01:59:35,301 --> 01:59:38,578
They took me on at 310 francs an hour.

1825
01:59:38,738 --> 01:59:41,719
For starters,
with a raise after a month.

1826
01:59:41,875 --> 01:59:43,252
That was your first paying job?

1827
01:59:43,410 --> 01:59:46,550
It was my first paying job.

1828
01:59:46,713 --> 01:59:49,626
I started working the next day.

1829
01:59:49,783 --> 01:59:51,490
And two days later,

1830
01:59:51,651 --> 01:59:56,430
a European in the same shop,

1831
01:59:56,589 --> 01:59:58,227
an unskilled worker,

1832
01:59:58,391 --> 02:00:02,396
found it abnormal that I, an Algerian,
was a skilled worker,

1833
02:00:02,562 --> 02:00:05,338
which wasn't quite true
as I was just starting,

1834
02:00:05,498 --> 02:00:09,412
and that he came in
to clean the lathe at night.

1835
02:00:10,470 --> 02:00:14,213
He complained to the chief.

1836
02:00:14,374 --> 02:00:18,413
"Why an Algerian?
He doesn't deserve to work.

1837
02:00:18,578 --> 02:00:21,718
"Having an Algerian
stepping on your toes..."

1838
02:00:34,627 --> 02:00:37,540
<i>An official Labor Ministry
document states</i>

1839
02:00:37,697 --> 02:00:43,375
<i>that usually Algerians only find
the most menial and unhealthiest jobs.</i>

1840
02:00:43,536 --> 02:00:47,416
<i>In May 1962, in the euphoria
of the Evian agreements,</i>

1841
02:00:47,574 --> 02:00:51,215
<i>we tend to forget that the lowest
proletariat in a colonizing country</i>

1842
02:00:51,377 --> 02:00:52,447
<i>always has a sub-proletariat</i>

1843
02:00:52,645 --> 02:00:53,953
<i>from the colonized country,</i>

1844
02:00:54,314 --> 02:00:57,261
<i>and this reality outlasts colonization.</i>

1845
02:01:07,727 --> 02:01:10,003
Was it your first contact with...

1846
02:01:10,363 --> 02:01:11,933
With racism, yes.

1847
02:01:12,632 --> 02:01:14,373
How did you feel about it?

1848
02:01:14,534 --> 02:01:17,879
At first I was disgusted by the man.

1849
02:01:18,938 --> 02:01:22,579
People weren't born to hate each other.

1850
02:01:23,676 --> 02:01:27,283
And when he said that...

1851
02:01:28,314 --> 02:01:31,557
It didn't affect me
as I had no complexes.

1852
02:01:31,718 --> 02:01:34,028
I didn't feel inferior to him.

1853
02:01:34,387 --> 02:01:37,994
Being insulting by him
didn't make me inferior.

1854
02:01:38,792 --> 02:01:40,863
I'm a man like him,
that's all.

1855
02:01:42,428 --> 02:01:45,602
So I said: "You're right."
And I quit.

1856
02:01:46,432 --> 02:01:49,003
I didn't want to make a fuss.

1857
02:01:49,369 --> 02:01:54,842
Was that when there was
the most racism in France?

1858
02:01:55,008 --> 02:01:57,010
Last year?
No, not exactly.

1859
02:01:57,377 --> 02:02:00,881
But some Europeans,
if I can say that,

1860
02:02:01,047 --> 02:02:02,993
did support racism.

1861
02:02:08,321 --> 02:02:10,824
And your second job?

1862
02:02:10,990 --> 02:02:12,936
My second job was later on,

1863
02:02:13,092 --> 02:02:16,972
as in the meantime,
I had problems

1864
02:02:17,363 --> 02:02:20,344
with the cops.

1865
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:24,448
I had trouble with them.
They put me in hospital.

1866
02:02:24,604 --> 02:02:26,345
They put you in hospital?

1867
02:02:26,506 --> 02:02:29,419
Yes. It was the DST.

1868
02:02:29,576 --> 02:02:33,046
Were you arrested in a raid?

1869
02:02:33,413 --> 02:02:36,883
Not exactly.
Someone snitched on me.

1870
02:02:37,050 --> 02:02:39,394
- Really?
- I was snitched on.

1871
02:02:39,552 --> 02:02:42,965
It was early morning...

1872
02:02:43,122 --> 02:02:44,328
We lived in...

1873
02:02:47,427 --> 02:02:50,465
Some old shacks.

1874
02:02:51,931 --> 02:02:53,933
One day I had a row with...

1875
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:57,479
I made a comment about discipline,

1876
02:02:57,637 --> 02:02:58,877
to one of my compatriots.

1877
02:02:59,038 --> 02:03:00,813
Soto mess me up,
he snitched on me.

1878
02:03:00,974 --> 02:03:03,079
We found out who it was...

1879
02:03:04,444 --> 02:03:05,514
He's still alive.

1880
02:03:05,678 --> 02:03:09,091
And your relations with the police?

1881
02:03:09,449 --> 02:03:13,920
Here's what happened:
it was a Friday morning.

1882
02:03:15,054 --> 02:03:18,035
They arrived at 4.30 am.

1883
02:03:18,391 --> 02:03:23,636
I'd got up a bit earlier
and gone outside to have a wash.

1884
02:03:23,796 --> 02:03:25,673
I'd left my door open,

1885
02:03:25,832 --> 02:03:29,041
there were lots of small rooms there.

1886
02:03:34,641 --> 02:03:38,487
They burst in,
I was lying on my bed, reading.

1887
02:03:38,645 --> 02:03:41,592
First a very young guy,
he stank of alcohol.

1888
02:03:42,682 --> 02:03:45,561
He'd been drinking,
he really stank.

1889
02:03:45,718 --> 02:03:48,562
My reaction was:
What's going on?

1890
02:03:48,721 --> 02:03:52,897
A guy bursts into my room
without knocking.

1891
02:03:53,059 --> 02:03:54,436
Stinking of alcohol.

1892
02:03:54,594 --> 02:03:57,541
I said: "Go and sleep it off
somewhere else."

1893
02:03:58,531 --> 02:04:00,738
Then he jumped on me.

1894
02:04:01,534 --> 02:04:03,707
He said: "On your feet."

1895
02:04:03,870 --> 02:04:05,713
I didn't want to get up.

1896
02:04:06,205 --> 02:04:09,550
So he insisted.
I got angry.

1897
02:04:09,709 --> 02:04:10,915
I started insulting him.

1898
02:04:11,077 --> 02:04:13,489
He let me insult him,

1899
02:04:13,646 --> 02:04:18,117
then he pulled out a badge: "DST."

1900
02:04:18,685 --> 02:04:21,564
When I saw it I was stunned.

1901
02:04:21,721 --> 02:04:24,964
I sat down, open mouthed.
And watched.

1902
02:04:25,124 --> 02:04:27,502
5 of them came in.
In front of my parents.

1903
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:31,073
They brought in my parents
who lived in the room opposite.

1904
02:04:31,965 --> 02:04:36,072
They got them out of bed
and brought them into the room.

1905
02:04:36,235 --> 02:04:38,909
2 cops held me and they punched me.

1906
02:04:39,672 --> 02:04:44,621
I went berserk.
They sent me to hospital.

1907
02:04:44,777 --> 02:04:48,725
I had a breakdown,
they took me to Bichat Hospital.

1908
02:04:48,881 --> 02:04:51,487
I was in there for 8 days.

1909
02:04:52,185 --> 02:04:56,224
Was your reaction the same
as when the worker insulted you?

1910
02:04:56,589 --> 02:04:59,069
No, it was different.

1911
02:04:59,726 --> 02:05:02,138
I almost became a racist.

1912
02:05:02,495 --> 02:05:06,637
I nearly turned racist
because that guy wasn't...

1913
02:05:06,799 --> 02:05:10,508
He really snitched on me.

1914
02:05:10,670 --> 02:05:12,809
Really, he did...

1915
02:05:12,972 --> 02:05:15,248
Or they wouldn't have burst in.

1916
02:05:15,608 --> 02:05:19,181
They'd have asked me politely
to accompany them.

1917
02:05:19,545 --> 02:05:22,890
But beating me up
in front of my parents,

1918
02:05:23,049 --> 02:05:24,824
I can't accept that.

1919
02:05:24,984 --> 02:05:27,260
They could have...

1920
02:05:27,620 --> 02:05:29,531
And it was 3 against 1.

1921
02:05:29,689 --> 02:05:32,863
If there'd been 1,
I might have taken a beating

1922
02:05:33,026 --> 02:05:35,006
but I'd have fought back.

1923
02:05:38,564 --> 02:05:40,635
How do you see the future?

1924
02:05:41,734 --> 02:05:45,648
In my view, personally,

1925
02:05:45,805 --> 02:05:49,514
I see the future of Algeria

1926
02:05:49,675 --> 02:05:52,554
as a free Algeria, first of all.

1927
02:05:52,712 --> 02:05:54,282
That's vital.

1928
02:05:54,647 --> 02:05:56,684
Freedom of thought.

1929
02:05:56,849 --> 02:06:00,524
And above all,
in cooperation with France.

1930
02:06:01,654 --> 02:06:05,727
All the Algerians I know accept that,

1931
02:06:05,892 --> 02:06:07,235
I know lots of Algerians,

1932
02:06:07,593 --> 02:06:09,197
they all agree with me

1933
02:06:09,562 --> 02:06:14,739
as they know France is like a mother.

1934
02:06:14,901 --> 02:06:20,044
Only we have a mother: France,

1935
02:06:20,206 --> 02:06:23,153
but we have no father to govern us.

1936
02:06:23,309 --> 02:06:26,654
The government represents the father.

1937
02:06:26,813 --> 02:06:31,626
But anyway, everyone wants
an independent Algeria,

1938
02:06:31,784 --> 02:06:36,324
but politically, economically,
and intellectually

1939
02:06:36,689 --> 02:06:38,066
relating to France.

1940
02:06:38,224 --> 02:06:40,932
Would you rather live
in France or Algeria?

1941
02:06:41,094 --> 02:06:43,904
I'll never go back to Algeria.

1942
02:06:44,063 --> 02:06:45,235
May I ask why?

1943
02:06:45,598 --> 02:06:50,638
There's nothing left
for me there, anywhere.

1944
02:06:50,803 --> 02:06:53,079
All my relations were killed.

1945
02:06:54,240 --> 02:06:56,015
What matters for you in life'?

1946
02:06:56,175 --> 02:07:00,317
Besides politics,
Algeria and the events?

1947
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:05,288
What matters for me firstly,
is supporting my family.

1948
02:07:05,651 --> 02:07:07,221
My father is old, he's 56.

1949
02:07:07,386 --> 02:07:10,196
I have 6 sisters and my mother.

1950
02:07:10,356 --> 02:07:13,030
I'm the only one who works.

1951
02:07:13,192 --> 02:07:16,867
What matters for me
is having a better life.

1952
02:07:17,029 --> 02:07:20,875
And not being a worker forever.

1953
02:07:21,033 --> 02:07:24,105
Doing something more interesting.

1954
02:07:24,270 --> 02:07:26,682
Would you like a career in politics?

1955
02:07:26,839 --> 02:07:28,045
No, never.

1956
02:07:28,207 --> 02:07:30,915
Once everything is sorted out,

1957
02:07:31,077 --> 02:07:32,920
will you remain political?

1958
02:07:34,881 --> 02:07:36,758
Politics is fine for a while but...

1959
02:07:36,916 --> 02:07:40,022
What would you do in your free time?

1960
02:07:40,186 --> 02:07:42,359
There's work and leisure.

1961
02:07:42,722 --> 02:07:48,138
I want to go into education, teaching.

1962
02:07:48,294 --> 02:07:54,245
I hope that the next generation,

1963
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:56,346
the one after me,

1964
02:07:56,702 --> 02:08:00,149
will have a bit more knowledge,

1965
02:08:00,306 --> 02:08:04,118
intellectually
and about life in general.

1966
02:08:04,277 --> 02:08:08,157
You'd like to go into
teaching and formation?

1967
02:08:08,314 --> 02:08:11,090
- How about marriage?
- No, not yet.

1968
02:08:11,250 --> 02:08:13,127
Not yet.
You think about it?

1969
02:08:14,353 --> 02:08:16,663
What about love?

1970
02:08:16,822 --> 02:08:19,166
We don't have time for love...

1971
02:08:19,325 --> 02:08:22,397
In Paris we're used to flirts

1972
02:08:22,762 --> 02:08:24,764
that last a couple of weeks.

1973
02:08:26,132 --> 02:08:28,908
It doesn't mean much to me.

1974
02:08:29,068 --> 02:08:30,445
It's nice though.

1975
02:08:30,803 --> 02:08:36,446
Taking a girl out dancing,
and flirting, is pleasant.

1976
02:08:36,809 --> 02:08:39,688
But it doesn't last.

1977
02:08:42,248 --> 02:08:44,785
- Do you have faith?
- In love?

1978
02:08:44,951 --> 02:08:49,832
No, you said you did.
Are you religious?

1979
02:08:51,023 --> 02:08:52,764
There's no afterlife?

1980
02:08:53,693 --> 02:08:54,728
100% atheist?

1981
02:08:54,894 --> 02:08:58,967
I don't believe in an afterlife.
This life is enough.

1982
02:08:59,131 --> 02:09:01,702
That's something else.

1983
02:09:01,867 --> 02:09:06,247
You can be sick of this one,
but still say there may be more.

1984
02:09:06,606 --> 02:09:08,813
- Nothing more?
- Nothing.

1985
02:09:08,975 --> 02:09:11,683
When I'm buried I'll be buried.

1986
02:09:12,144 --> 02:09:12,244
13 May, Place des Pyramides

1987
02:09:12,245 --> 02:09:15,385
13 May, Place des Pyramides

1988
02:09:15,781 --> 02:09:18,057
Celebration of the anniversary of

1989
02:09:18,251 --> 02:09:19,958
Joan of Arc

1990
02:10:09,201 --> 02:10:12,045
Same day, place de l'Etoile

1991
02:11:43,195 --> 02:11:45,801
Present arms!

1992
02:12:24,003 --> 02:12:25,414
Good to see you.

1993
02:12:27,173 --> 02:12:28,447
Good to see you.

1994
02:12:28,808 --> 02:12:30,185
Good to see you.

1995
02:12:37,583 --> 02:12:40,029
Two agitators

1996
02:12:49,061 --> 02:12:54,477
Ferdinand Lop,
losing French presidential candidate

1997
02:12:54,667 --> 02:12:56,943
(restricted suffrage)

1998
02:16:32,618 --> 02:16:36,293
We're woken at 6 am
by the nun unlocking the door.

1999
02:16:36,455 --> 02:16:41,268
The doors date from when
the Roquette Prison was built.

2000
02:16:41,427 --> 02:16:46,536
The key of the cell is that long.

2001
02:16:46,699 --> 02:16:52,115
The sound of the key in the lock
would wake up a regiment.

2002
02:16:52,271 --> 02:16:54,251
We're woken up at 6 am,

2003
02:16:54,406 --> 02:16:58,445
then we go to the communal
washroom in the shape of...

2004
02:16:58,610 --> 02:17:01,216
What's it called?
Hexagon? Pentagon?

2005
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:04,361
A sort of hexagon, I'd say.

2006
02:17:04,516 --> 02:17:07,019
A toilet on each hexagon tip.

2007
02:17:07,219 --> 02:17:10,166
There's a row of taps,

2008
02:17:10,355 --> 02:17:13,063
everyone does her best to wash.

2009
02:17:14,226 --> 02:17:17,673
- In cold water'?
- Sure. No heating.

2010
02:17:18,063 --> 02:17:19,974
Roll-call, then breakfast.

2011
02:17:20,165 --> 02:17:23,442
A girl brings
a pan of vile black liquid.

2012
02:17:23,602 --> 02:17:27,072
What else? I think that's all.
Just a drink.

2013
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:28,582
Then the canteen.

2014
02:17:29,575 --> 02:17:32,419
- Mass every day'?
- No, on Sundays.

2015
02:17:32,578 --> 02:17:36,390
Usually everyone goes to Mass
to meet up.

2016
02:17:36,548 --> 02:17:38,528
The nuns must be thrilled.

2017
02:17:39,318 --> 02:17:41,320
What are they like? Nice? Nasty?

2018
02:17:41,487 --> 02:17:45,629
Same as everyone:
some good, some really awful.

2019
02:17:45,791 --> 02:17:47,270
But some are great.

2020
02:17:47,459 --> 02:17:49,439
The young ones.

2021
02:17:49,595 --> 02:17:54,772
Especially one who was
in charge of my first section.

2022
02:17:55,134 --> 02:17:59,310
She always said
she'd look after prisoners.

2023
02:17:59,505 --> 02:18:03,317
But there were horrible
old country nuns

2024
02:18:03,475 --> 02:18:09,187
who yelled louder than the prisoners,
they were stupid and evil.

2025
02:18:09,348 --> 02:18:13,387
What was the worst thing about it?

2026
02:18:14,219 --> 02:18:15,596
The other girls.

2027
02:22:44,056 --> 02:22:49,563
<i>The end credits, which should have
included the names of the participants,</i>

2028
02:22:49,728 --> 02:22:52,834
<i>have never been found
and might never have existed.</i>

2029
02:22:52,998 --> 02:22:57,105
<i>You are listening to the music
of Michel Legrand</i>

2030
02:22:57,269 --> 02:22:59,271
<i>which should have accompanied it.</i>
