1
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,050
Hey! Hands off, you spacko!

2
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,090
I didn't mean to touch your, uh ... things ...

3
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,640
Ummm, Ummm, Ummm...what?

4
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,390
I'm so sorry, I'm...
- Whatever. loser!

5
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,280
During August 21st, 1968, the
capital of Czechoslovakia, Prague,

6
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,540
was occupied by troops from the Warsaw-Pact countries.

7
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,000
This means that, as it were, the end of the efforts to ask...

8
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,330
So. Not with word or reforms,

9
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,630
but, rather, with tanks,
the Prague spring...

10
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,890
How did the tits feel?

11
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,980
Come on!
How did the tits feel?

12
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,110
Which ones?

13
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,440
The porno-tits.
The ones you checked out.

14
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,530
I didnt check out her tits!
- Psst!

15
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,650
Mr Kuhl?

16
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,870
You have something funny to tell us about about female breasts?

17
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,380
What's up, Un-Kuhl?
Have you even seen tits up close before?

18
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,460
Only his mum's...

19
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,340
--and Berni's.

20
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,590
At least I have tits...
unlike your girlfriend.

21
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,500
Bernhard!
- What did you say?!

22
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,550
Sit down! I want to see the tanks.

23
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,090
Now, let all just calm down.

24
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,100
I know that you all find this boring,

25
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,230
but this study trip takes place
in a very important part in European history.

26
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,060
After all,Prague is also the
heart of Europe.

27
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,940
Or the pussy of Europe.

28
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,990
I expect each of you to write a two-page report about Prague.

29
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,570
Magnus, wait a minute.

30
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,660
Did you faggots make out again last night?

31
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,660
Of course, and your father was there too.

32
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,670
He found it even hotter than with your mum.
Ka-ching!

33
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,170
Spastic.

34
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,590
Dude! That was the worst comeback of all time.

35
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,470
What?! It was extra-phat!

36
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,630
I dissed him, his dad and his mum all at once,

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,220
by saying that.
- I understand, Berni.

38
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,850
Max! Are you coming?

39
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,520
And no running, Maximilian!

40
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,740
And?
- Red Bull and a Coffee, please.

41
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,530
Black?
- Yeah.

42
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,990
And very hot.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,960
Here.

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,590
Thanks.

45
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,100
Woah, I'll tell you what.
She's so into me.

46
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,760
She's so not!
- Max, come on!

47
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,140
Berni, she's really not.

48
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,520
Can't you make a joke?
- But not about my mum.

49
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,900
Why? You gonna kill me? Huh?

50
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,150
Like your Dad, the Boxer?

51
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,430
I don't like Boxing!

52
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,150
How can you say that?
Your dad was a real champion.

53
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,310
Yeah, and when he became a champion,
he walked out on me and my Mum.

54
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,950
I'm in tears. For real!

55
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,110
Anyway, let's talk about Prague.
- What about Prague?

56
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,080
Prague is our chance.

57
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,450
For what?
- We already have one foot in the grave.

58
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,710
We need to get out of here before schools all over.

59
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,870
Bullshit. When did we ever leave?

60
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,260
Dude, all the time.
- When, Berni?

61
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,470
The rave the other night?

62
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,560
Which your mum had to pick us up from

63
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,100
because you had an asthma attack...
from the fog machine.

64
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,770
We're losers, and losers go to loser school.

65
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,730
Then don't whine when you sell insurance for you dad later on in life.

66
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,070
I'm not going to work for my dad.
- Yeah? And does he know that yet?

67
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,230
Of course.

68
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,570
You know what they are afraid of,
and you insure them against it. Chop!

69
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,080
And chop and chop and chop-chop.

70
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,830
Look what I’ve accomplished.
Or look at the watch on your arm.

71
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,040
That’s your grandpa’s watch,
what did he get it for?

72
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,460
The best...
-The Best Representative '73.

73
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,090
And who did you grandad leave the watch to?

74
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,840
You.
- The Best Representative '88.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,720
And who has the watch now?
- Me.

76
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,000
There you go!

77
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,470
Anyway, in Prague, we are the kings.

78
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,980
In Prague, your deepest and darkest wishes can come true.

79
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,270
I want to drive a tank!

80
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,860
Hey‚ Max. Sometimes I think you’re just fucking with us.

81
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,190
Since we met,
it's been ten straight years of bullshit.

82
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,450
Geht's nicht?
- No.

83
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,950
Driving tanks is out of the question.

84
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,150
Okay. What's the plan?

85
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,990
We make a pact.

86
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,420
We’ll go to Prague and we’ll get in real deep.

87
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,580
Until it gets really warm and humid.

88
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,420
And we’re not getting out until we’ve gone down like ever before.

89
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,340
What are you gonna do when it’s done?

90
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,100
Mom, I don’t want you to smoke!
And I want you to stop getting on my nerves.

91
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,730
So embarrasing. Come on, let's go.

92
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,810
Wait!

93
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,480
Wait!!!

94
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,410
I think I’m going to be sick.

95
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,830
Magnus, get the sickbag.
- Fuck, he's gonna blow.

96
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,660
Magnus, the bag infront of you ...

97
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,790
Blaargh!!!!!!

98
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,000
Amazing! Magnus totally puked.

99
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,120
Here, Magnus.

100
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,210
I don't need to blow my nose.
- You forgot some.

101
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,750
Hey, Magnus, you look like a zombie after dinner.

102
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,420
Say "Brains".

103
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,630
"Brains"?

104
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,760
Stop fucking with my brother!
Give it to me!

105
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,020
Maybe he is pregnant.

106
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,300
Idiot!

107
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,520
- I didn't do anything...
- - Don't stare at that thing.

108
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,730
This is a reproduction of the Prague Castle in Minecraft.

109
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,520
Fine, but it makes you feel sick.
- 3784 blocks.

110
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,910
Just look out the window, okay?

111
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,740
I gave him my french-fries bag!

112
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,400
There was fries still in it.

113
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,070
What’s the matter with you?

114
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,210
I don’t want her to think I’m making fun of Magnus.

115
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,000
Fuck what that snobby chick thinks.

116
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,120
Hey, Magnus! Have you ever seen your sister naked?
- Yes, many times.

117
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,430
Thanks.

118
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,140
No...you...I don't...

119
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,440
Woah. It smells like puke in here.

120
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,110
Whoa! Hey, look, Berni!

121
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,000
Pussy of Europe, or what?

122
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Looks more like the ass of the world.

123
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,830
You're alway so negative. Must be a hell of a view up there.

124
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,840
Welcome to Praha Beach Hotel.

125
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,310
Ladies and gentlemen...
- There's even a beach here!

126
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,770
This beautiful establishment will be your home for the next few days.

127
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,810
Between 9pm and 8am, you must stay here.

128
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,730
Any disregard or violations
will be punished with an immediate return home.

129
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,200
Okay, okay. Yes, yes.
No. I know.

130
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,790
But since Mrs Hofer became "ill"
in the short term, there is no other way.

131
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,450
Besides, your life’s only on Facebook

132
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,840
or Twitter or whatever...

133
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,840
Do you have internet here?

134
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,840
Uh, no. Internet.

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,720
Uh, broken.
- Broken.

136
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,380
- What a dump!.
- Is he fucking with us?

137
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,760
Luisa?

138
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,760
Are you crying?

139
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,610
Paul?

140
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,320
Hm.

141
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,200
Tomorrow night’s gonna be phat, right? Just us.

142
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,790
Logo, dude.

143
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,620
Night.

144
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,370
I’d like to be as tired at night as I am in the morning.

145
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,510
Dude, please don’t say you’re doing what I think you’re doing.

146
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,970
Don’t think. Are you a pervert?

147
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,560
No, but you wouldn’t happen to be alone, so can you please not?

148
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,890
I can’t sleep if I don’t.

149
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,940
What building are we in front of?
Other than Magnus, please, this is the...?

150
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,530
Karlsbrücke.

151
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,450
This is a famous landmark of Prague
and the oldest stone bridge in Europe,

152
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,840
built in what year?
Except for Magnus.

153
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,250
1997...250...
Yesterday... 1965.

154
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,790
Stick with me.

155
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,300
- Now, please pay attention to the screen.
- Magnus.

156
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,550
One of these locks can be opened with the key.

157
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,600
Max!

158
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,940
Excuse me! Hello! Don’t touch!
This is no fun.

159
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
Magnus!

160
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,580
We're waiting!

161
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,930
Ow!

162
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,360
Are you not going shopping at all?

163
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,280
Uh...no.

164
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,200
I just wanted to say that
yesterday on the bus...

165
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,710
I really didn’t mean to make fun of Magnus.
- Yeah, I know.

166
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,370
And I'm sorry too. I overeacted earlier.

167
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,380
It’s not easy with him...

168
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,640
I also have a retarded cousin.
I know what it's like...

169
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,970
Magnus isn't retarded!
- No! No, of course he's not disabled!

170
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,260
I mean...because of...his...

171
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,520
Alzheimers?
- Aspergers?

172
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,430
It’s not a disability, it’s an mild form of autism.

173
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,940
Sorry, I'm...

174
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,280
Because actually ... I find him quite ... normal.

175
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,530
Really?
- Yeah.

176
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,000
Actually, I think he’s pretty cool.

177
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,330
That’s nice of you to say.

178
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,590
Um, I was just thinking...
- Yeah?

179
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,220
Marcella and I were gonna sneak out
tonight and go to Heart,

180
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,220
some super cool club.
- Really?!

181
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,550
Yeah, and I was wondering if you...
- Yes! Of course I will!

182
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,810
Really?
- Definitely.

183
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,060
Because I couldn’t possibly take
Magnus with me, so...

184
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,480
What? Magnus???

185
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,990
I promised our parents I wouldn’t leave him alone.

186
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,740
But if he does something with you, that would be cool.

187
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,070
Totally.

188
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,660
Ey, that’s really nice of you.

189
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,960
- Hey.
- - Hi.

190
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,740
Hey, Mr. Un-Kuhl?
What's up with you, you leek [Hamburgish for pussy]?

191
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,250
Nothing much, what's up with you... celery?

192
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,300
- Isn't this a little slutty, or?
- Western-Style, Baby!

193
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,430
We have to do something if
we want to keep up here.

194
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,310
Jonas also bought a super sexy shirt.

195
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,720
I can’t wait to see that.

196
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,310
I'm going to get a coffee..
You coming with me?
- Yeah.

197
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,820
Hey? Hey?

198
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,200
Check it out, man. Great, isn't it?

199
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,150
"Adadas".
- Yeah, man.

200
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,950
Hey, only 2,000 crowns. Jackpot!
- That's over 70 euros.

201
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,490
Really?

202
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,370
Hey, Max. I wouldn't tuck my shirt in
my pants like that if I were you.

203
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,170
Why's that?

204
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,920
Hey, leave it that way.
It's cool, man

205
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,590
I’ve already checked everything out for tonight.
It will be awesome.

206
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,720
Oh, yeah...
There's a...little problem.

207
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,800
... and by sacrificing the fire-goblin,

208
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,220
I can increase my attack and defense by one point.

209
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,770
Why are we sitting here with this freak
when we’re supposed to be going out?

210
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,690
I've already explained it to you.
- Explain it again.

211
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,450
...and the original starting point...

212
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,360
Because Magnus asked me.

213
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,030
I hate Magnus.
- Why didn't you say no?!

214
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,170
Now you have to defend
- We don’t have to do anything!

215
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,050
Yes, that's the rules.
- Woah, hey, Magnus. If I were you...

216
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,800
Who would you like to be?
- Uh, what? No.

217
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,760
Who would you like to be, Berni?
- Huh? Nobody.

218
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,130
Come on, keep playing.

219
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,670
Okay, then, um, let’s defend ourselves with our...

220
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Thornwall?

221
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,230
You're welcome to do that, if you want to do something stupid.

222
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,510
With the attack reversal, I would
break through your thorn wall

223
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,020
and destroy your Highland unicorns.

224
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,560
Spontaneous magic. Bad luck!

225
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,150
Tough luck!
- Max!

226
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,990
Well, Magnus, I guess you won.

227
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,870
Not bad.

228
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,200
But we also have a rule.

229
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,090
If you win, you’ll have to taste this potion.

230
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,550
What's in it?
Soda.

231
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,720
Vodka, Rum, Tequila, Gin
and Blue Curacao for the colour.

232
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,100
It’s called "Adios Motherfucker." Cool, right?

233
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,600
Stop! Only who wins...
- what?

234
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,260
That is the rule..
- Well.

235
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,310
Move over.

236
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,380
That's it, Master Magnusson.

237
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,010
I don’t think so, my flaming golden cock has some obsession!

238
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,850
Dude, did you just say your dick is obsessed with pussy?

239
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,430
- No!
I heard that too.

240
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,390
Evil obsession.

241
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,480
Evil obsession.
- Magnus, hey!

242
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,740
We're all a bit obsessed with pussy. Alright.

243
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,070
And that’s why we’re leaving now...
- What?

244
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,280
...on a little excursion.

245
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,320
Okay.

246
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,030
No, not okay!
- What's the worst that can happen?

247
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,990
I also got us extra t-shirts.

248
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,250
Guys, you will be amazed. This is going to be awesome.

249
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,210
What do we do first?
- I’d like to go back to Charles Bridge.

250
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,180
Yeah, we do that on every f...fuck!

251
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,670
There is the...

252
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,840
Magnus! Come here!

253
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,730
What are you doing?

254
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,860
Asking Mr Graeser if he would like
a transcript of our excursion.

255
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,940
Why are we speaking so quitely?

256
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,200
Because we want to surprise Mr. Graeser.

257
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,700
Oh, okay

258
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,280
What do we do now? Max?

259
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,110
What is he up to?

260
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,660
Such a daredevil.

261
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,080
The fuck?

262
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,370
For fuck's sake, Max! Why?!

263
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,830
I just did a little improvising.

264
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,660
By killing our teacher?!

265
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,950
He's just unconscious.

266
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,210
Wait a minute.

267
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,960
All right, up there.

268
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,970
Paul, give us a hand.

269
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,290
See?

270
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,590
Then we take the bottle.
Here, the blanket over ...

271
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,810
Should I take his shoes off??
- No, man. What then?

272
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,970
Come on. Let's go.

273
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,310
Paul, Magnus! Let's go! Come on!

274
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,610
Stop!

275
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,620
What are you doing?
- Why?

276
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,460
Because you wear stupid t-shirts?

277
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,000
" #Embarassing"

278
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,630
"#No Plan at All"
- Mmm!

279
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,340
So what's your great plan then?
- We need to look for an internet cafe.

280
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,430
And how did you get out??
- The rear exit.

281
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,930
Well, have fun, huh?
- See ya.

282
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,140
Don’t be late for bed, kids.

283
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,150
- Have fun too.
- Max, really?

284
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,400
And how do we get out of here now?
- Wait a minute.

285
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,530
Fwoah!

286
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,090
Hello.

287
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,260
Branko?

288
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,600
Yes.

289
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,730
Don’t talk to the driver.

290
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,980
Come on in!

291
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,860
Hey Berni, wait a minute.

292
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,310
Where did you get this?

293
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,230
An insider tipoff.
- And where?

294
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,440
Don't worry.
It said "Best Limo-Service in Prague".

295
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,480
He’s going to take us down a dark alley
where his buddies will be waiting for us.

296
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,950
And then what? Rape us?

297
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,740
Harvest our organs?

298
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,910
Hey‚ you're so paranoid.

299
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,950
Besides, I don’t think he needs
his buddies for that.

300
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,800
Great!

301
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,090
Have fun on the internet!

302
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,730
Everything comes on here.

303
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,430
Hey!

304
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,100
Wow!

305
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,450
Where did you get the money for the limo?

306
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,280
I need some money.
- What for?

307
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,870
For a party in Prague.
We want to buy drugs.

308
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,700
Maybe in the whorehouse.
- All right.

309
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,430
Uh... Branko?

310
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,970
What ... is going on?

311
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,360
Just...stay cool.

312
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,280
Please rape him first instead.

313
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,110
Come along!

314
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,030
Woah!
- Shit.

315
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,000
Cool! A desert eagle, right?

316
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,460
800 euros and it belongs to you.

317
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,960
New iPhone, 200 Euro.

318
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,630
Or here...nice TV.

319
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,040
Full HD, 500 Euro.

320
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,550
Massage chair, also very cheap.
3,000 euros.

321
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,010
You can’t complain about that.

322
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,930
And this is all completely legal, right?

323
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,100
Branko. How much for the MP-2?

324
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,110
Uzi? 2.000.

325
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,980
Can I borrow some money?

326
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,820
Why would anyone hire a goat?

327
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,240
Eurgh!!!

328
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,900
I also have kidneys or new hearts.

329
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,790
Branko has everything.

330
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,040
Cool.

331
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,370
Maybe later.

332
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,380
But right now, let’s celebrate.

333
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,540
Hey Berni!

334
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,430
Paul. Uhhh...

335
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,720
Yes, it's Paul.

336
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,610
I couldn't reach Magnus.
How's it going?

337
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,390
Great. Really great.

338
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,520
It’s so loud in there.

339
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,530
Berni is playing DJ again.
It’s almost like a real party.

340
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,990
Seriously, with Magnus?
Can you put him on please?

341
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,120
No!!!
- Why not?

342
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,700
Shit, Berni!
- What is it? What happened?

343
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,080
No, uh...
Max, you idiot! Watch out!

344
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,620
Max spilled Coke over my bed.

345
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,460
Dude, are you crazy?
Get here now!

346
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,840
Can I please speak to Magnus now?

347
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,340
Magnus is outside.
- I need to...

348
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,130
He needs to go.

349
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,090
Okay, that could take longer with him.

350
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,100
Give him my love, will you?

351
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,260
I will!

352
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,140
Magnus! Please come back inside!

353
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,680
You can see the Andromeda Nebula.

354
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,610
Great, but please come back in!

355
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,230
Branko, I'm going to be sick.

356
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,070
Whoa!

357
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,230
Fuck!

358
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,740
Magnus?

359
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,820
Magnus?

360
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,370
Are you okay?

361
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,750
What is the square root of 4761?

362
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,670
And your favourite position?
- 69!

363
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,960
I told you, take it easy.

364
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,720
Come on, get up.

365
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,230
Honestly, I'm fine.

366
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,310
What's going on?

367
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,650
I need a drink. Who’s in?

368
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,330
I’d like three beers.

369
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,090
Who were you talking to in the car?

370
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,460
Me?
- Yes, you.

371
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,080
Me? No one.

372
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,380
Cheers!

373
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,810
Man, Max!

374
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,890
I had such terrible taste in my mouth.

375
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,350
Ladies and Gentlemen.

376
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,110
It's wrestling time!

377
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,770
Yeah!

378
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,940
I'm Iooking for a fearless volunteer.

379
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:57,080
Mud-wrestling. Berni, your thing!
You like that shit.

380
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,580
Who dares to challenge
our two beautiful wrestlers?

381
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,710
Here! My friend wants to...
- No, stop it!

382
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:06,540
Like you said,
"Until it gets really warm and humid."

383
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,130
That’s not what I meant.
- Here, my friend.

384
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,260
Oh oh oh oh. We've got a volunteer!

385
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,460
No.

386
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,090
What's your name?
- Berni.

387
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,010
Okay, Berni. Why not?

388
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,270
Berni. Berni. Berni!

389
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,100
Berni. Berni.
- Stop it!

390
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,480
I don’t want to do it!
Just stop.

391
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,190
Come on!
- No! Hey...Max! Max!

392
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,620
What the fuck are you looking at, ay?

393
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,960
Wanna blow me, fuckwit?

394
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,050
Huh? Geek!

395
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,630
Fucking fudgepacker!

396
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,930
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

397
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,760
Gentleman. Let's give a great hand
of applause to our fearless challenger:

398
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,430
Berni!

399
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,690
Where are you? Come on!

400
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,400
They are waiting for you.

401
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,810
He is coming.

402
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,980
Oh!

403
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,200
Yeah!

404
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,540
What’s wrong with Berni?

405
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,750
I’ll get us some more beers.

406
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,080
Look at that fatty!

407
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,620
Hey, fatty!

408
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,680
Hey, are you kidding me?
- What?

409
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,510
What was that, you bum?

410
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:05,270
Fucking German.
Back off, Sauerkraut!

411
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,430
Hey!
It's that fucking knob gobbler again!

412
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,810
This woman has a penis.
- What's your fucking probem?

413
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,020
Hey, there’s another way we can...

414
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,980
Whoa!

415
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:17,940
Hey!

416
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,150
Yeah!

417
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,610
Whoa!

418
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,500
Oh, are we leaving?

419
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,470
Let's go back to the car.
- Hello!

420
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,380
Magnus, hurry up!

421
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,920
Berni is still missing.

422
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,090
We’ll wait for him in the car, okay?

423
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,840
Shit!

424
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,100
Fuck! Where is he?

425
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,280
Now who the fuck are you‚ huh?

426
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,020
Where to now?
- Magnus is done for.

427
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,940
Let’s go back to the hotel.

428
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,860
It doesn't matter whether he sleeps here or in his bed.

429
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,650
Think of the pact, there’s more waiting for us, I feel it - yes?

430
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,820
I don't understand.

431
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,610
Of course, you can also take a selfie
to the hotel, and I don’t mean a photo.

432
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,910
Yeah.

433
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,880
OK. Then we go to the heart.

434
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,010
It's supposed to be a cool club.
- Mhm.

435
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,710
If you say so.

436
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:07,800
Branko, bring us to the heart! And turn up the music!

437
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,000
You think this is the right place?

438
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,540
Yes, says right there.

439
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,210
I thought "Heart" was more like Herz.

440
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,670
No, believe me, cool clubs look like this.

441
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,340
I have to go for a piss.
- Me too. Max?

442
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,670
Nah.

443
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Wait!

444
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,130
Brrr.

445
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,790
Hey, Paul.

446
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,420
Hey, Man!
- Pranked. I held it with my left hand.

447
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,790
Ha ha.

448
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,630
What's up?

449
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,720
- Oh.
- Yeah, oh.

450
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,630
Sounds appealing.

451
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,310
Magnus is gone.
- What?

452
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,100
As in, he is no longer here.

453
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,940
He's already inside.
- What?!

454
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,480
Why didn’t you tell me?
- You didn't ask.

455
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,940
Oh, Max!

456
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,450
Okay, I'll get him out.

457
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,750
I'll go as well.

458
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,200
I'll wait here.

459
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,750
Uh... Hello. Erm...

460
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,390
Ahoy.

461
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,760
Could we maybe... I just...

462
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,880
Right.

463
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,350
Well...

464
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,810
What?

465
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,720
Well, I don’t think he liked your style.

466
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,360
Shit, that’s not funny!

467
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,610
Woah, chill out.
Just call Magnus on the phone, huh?, hm?

468
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,580
Hello, Magnus?

469
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,910
Magnus, hello?

470
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,450
Will you please come out?

471
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,210
Okay.

472
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,550
Magnus?

473
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,220
You can hang up.
- I think it was Magnus' turn.

474
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,880
It is.
- Why are you calling me?

475
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,350
Is that your phone?
- No, but you called.

476
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,260
For fuck's sake Max, you're really killing me.

477
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,900
I think it's totally unfair,

478
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,860
that Magnus is alone in there now...
and having fun.

479
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,980
Come on, let's have a look around the back.

480
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,660
Ow! Not on the head!

481
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,790
Don't be like that.

482
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,460
Pfosten ['dumb as a post’].

483
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,490
Okay.

484
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,250
Oh God!

485
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,460
I’m going to fa...fa..fall!

486
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,800
Ow!

487
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,920
Eurgh!

488
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:39,260
Berni‚ Berni...

489
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,640
Close it! Close it! Close it!

490
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,060
Ahoy.

491
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,480
Yes.

492
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,480
Quick, give him money.

493
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,010
What was that?

494
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,140
My asthma tablets. For emergencies.

495
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,970
Dude, what a freak.

496
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,230
Berni, come!

497
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,360
Small Tip:

498
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,740
If there’s a blood shower
coming from the ceiling. Run. Fast.

499
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,490
Berni, come on!

500
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,290
Hey, guys!

501
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,830
Did any of you see a goat around here?

502
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,970
That way.
- There?

503
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,470
Yeah.
- Cool. Thanks.

504
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,060
Magnus?

505
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:11,770
Magnus?

506
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,070
Berni, stop it!
- Why?

507
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,080
Just - just don't.

508
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,870
Magnus!

509
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,410
Woah!

510
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,770
Pff. Pussy.

511
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,020
You were just as scared.

512
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,010
Ahoy.

513
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,230
Mann!

514
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,780
Uh... Hello, nice to meet you.

515
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,790
P-Paul... and Berni from Germany.

516
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,820
Deutschland?

517
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,240
Bielefeld?
- Uh... No.

518
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,130
I love Bielefeld.

519
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,790
I've lived there for five years.

520
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,550
But it's all over because...very ugly. Much blood.

521
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,090
I had to go. Came here.

522
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,880
Made everything new. A lot of hard work.

523
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,680
But little rats always come.

524
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,970
Sell ​​drugs here in my establishment.

525
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,310
From Jiri!

526
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,610
He was Jiri, wasn't he?

527
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,150
Ow!

528
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,240
There must have been a mistake.
- We didn't sell any drugs.

529
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,380
Yeah okay, so maybe it looks like... Ouch!

530
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,880
They weren't drugs. We are only looking for our friend.

531
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,960
- Friend?
- Yeah. With glasses...

532
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,970
Looks funny. Talks funny.

533
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,600
He came in when we were outside ...

534
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,190
Jiri forget all mistakes.

535
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,860
And you do small favors for Jiri

536
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,120
and show if you have big hearts too, huh?

537
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,820
Unfortunately, we don't have time.

538
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,110
No time?

539
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,000
Yes. How many times do we have to tell you?
Should we paint you a picture?

540
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,540
We didn't sell drugs...

541
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,960
What? No!

542
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,260
More!

543
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,100
Oh man, this is so stupid!

544
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,100
Ow, Man! Not so hard!

545
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,270
Ow!

546
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,060
Ouch!
- Are you crazy?

547
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,980
Huh?! Shut up! Ow!
- Enough!

548
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,900
Man, ouch!
- Hey!

549
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,030
Shut up.

550
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,070
Stop!

551
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,420
Shit.

552
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:24,340
You...are doing small favors for Jiri now.

553
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,090
And Jiri will take care of your friend.

554
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,140
Fuck!

555
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,930
Magnus?

556
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,770
What kind of favor?

557
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,380
I'll get Max.

558
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,380
What were you doing in there?

559
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,890
I'll tell you in the car.

560
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,640
Fuck!

561
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,810
Paul!

562
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:20,970
Paul, come on!

563
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,940
Dude, get in!

564
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,990
There, please.

565
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,490
Dude, are you crazy?

566
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,000
No cops, or do you want them to flatten Magnus?

567
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,830
Where are we going now?

568
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:43,710
Just doing a little criminal courier service.

569
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,210
Cool.

570
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,530
Hey, where is he going?

571
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,320
Home time.

572
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,400
What do you mean, hometime?

573
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,700
I may have only paid for half the night.

574
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,040
"Maybe"?
- Woah, take it easy!

575
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,460
Now, let’s go inside and do this thing.

576
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,810
Ahoy.

577
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,190
Somehow everything in Czech
always sounds blunt and rude.

578
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,320
Piss off!

579
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,910
German, too.

580
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,570
Here, let me.

581
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,830
Now listen to me very carefully.

582
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,580
We want to see your shitty boss, pronto, ca...piche?

583
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,920
You listen to me, I’ll...

584
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,460
Jiri sent us.

585
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,500
With this.

586
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,920
Wait here.

587
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,340
Oh fuck!

588
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:26,440
Hi‚ can I get some AK-47 cartridges?

589
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,690
Sure.

590
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,620
Fuck me!

591
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,540
Max...

592
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,380
Mmm...

593
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,640
And now?

594
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,350
I don’t give money to little girls like you.

595
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:42,550
Talk about yourself!

596
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,890
We are not little girls. We are tough guys.

597
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:50,180
What a little pussy you've got.

598
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,780
No, please...
- Oh yeah?

599
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,200
Do little girls do something like this here?

600
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,910
Yeah, Berni. Show him what you can do.

601
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,740
No, Berni. Leave it.

602
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,460
I’ve done it a thousand times.
- Yeah, but with a set square.

603
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:16,340
Quicker!

604
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:18,920
Quicker!

605
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,220
Yeah, go on!

606
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,570
Fuck!

607
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,360
Not bad.

608
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,150
Stupid bloody shit.

609
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,080
Paul! Paul!

610
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,330
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

611
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:56,460
Oh god, Berni, I have your blood in my mouth!

612
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,010
Bleurggghhhh!

613
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,680
My suit.

614
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,430
Oh God! Oh God! Help me!

615
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:15,770
Berni?

616
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,740
And another one?

617
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,740
What is that?

618
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,830
Muscle relaxants and vodka.

619
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,330
A right old mix for your friend.

620
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:33,090
Can I do one of those?
- Don’t touch it.

621
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,840
Yeah, I’d rather not do that.

622
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,430
Great, wonderful, and always laughing.

623
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,640
Mmm.

624
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,970
What are you gonna do with it?

625
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:50,060
I heard you have to put it in your mouth
and then you can sew it back on.

626
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,940
What? I can’t walk around with my finger in my mouth.

627
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:58,360
What does it look like?

628
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,960
Thanks.
- You deserve it.

629
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,370
Max, can you please put the knife away?

630
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,430
- Woah, I need a piss.
- Me too, all the time.

631
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:30,260
- But hurry, okay?
- - Yeah.

632
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,490
Have you drained your seniors' bladders or should I...

633
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,960
Hello‚ wanker!

634
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,840
What's in the bag?

635
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,510
Why don't you show me? Huh?

636
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,100
Look.

637
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,060
This...can either
go the easy way, yeah?

638
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,120
Or the hard way.
I don't really fucking care.

639
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,990
But I probably enjoy
the hard way a little bit more.

640
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,910
Paul, don't give it to him! Ah!

641
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:37,210
Good boy.

642
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,670
Yes!

643
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,630
Look at this, huh? Fucking jackpot.

644
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:49,300
Let's go to the club
and get fucking pissed.

645
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:55,270
Prague, here we come!

646
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:58,310
We're gonna fuck everyone! Ey, ey, ey!

647
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:00,400
Prague, here we come

648
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,570
Fuck! Hey, my finger was in the bag.

649
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,820
Yo, this is fucking bullshit, man.

650
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:09,410
We have to do something!
How long before you can't sew a finger back on?

651
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:10,610
It's so clear...

652
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,580
This is about Magnus,
and all you can think about is yourself.

653
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,910
What? You are the only one here
who only thinks of yourself.

654
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:20,120
Don’t you think I care?
You’re just after Juli.

655
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,210
And what if I am?
- When are you finally going to get it?

656
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:24,500
She’s just fucking with you,
just like Jonas.

657
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,510
Juli is different.
- Sure.

658
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,340
That's why she ties her spacko
brother to your leg.

659
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,680
Dude, we have a pact.

660
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,560
I don't care.

661
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:38,100
What? The pact was for you!

662
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,520
So that you could finally loosen up a bit.

663
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,400
You want me to loosen up?

664
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,360
Look around you, Berni!

665
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,520
It’s not all easy enough for you, huh?

666
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,780
Fuck your finger!

667
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,740
Fuck your pact!
And fuck you, man!

668
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,920
Paul!

669
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,580
Leave me alone, Max!

670
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,270
Fuck!

671
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,360
To the Heart Club.

672
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,610
Hard Club, yes?

673
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:34,530
No, no. Heart, with a "T"!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

674
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:35,910
Let's go.

675
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,830
Why don't we just get it back?

676
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,960
What?

677
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,960
The bag.

678
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:54,680
Very funny.

679
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,510
We don’t even know where the guys are.

680
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,850
We're fucked. Check this out!

681
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,980
My dad always says:

682
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,610
You are not beaten when
you are lying on the ground,

683
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,650
but only when you no longer get back up.

684
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:20,080
What have you got there?

685
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,670
What do you mean,
"what have you got there?"

686
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,670
The one who had you in a
headlock left something behind.

687
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:27,210
What? Clean it up.

688
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:29,840
Oh, it's just an imprint of a stamp.

689
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,970
Probably from the club where
the wankers are celebrating their booty.

690
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,940
What are we going to do now?
- We're going to get the bag back.

691
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,690
That's what I've been saying.

692
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,310
Yo.

693
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,550
Marcella?
- What are you doing here?

694
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,090
Have you seen Juli?

695
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:01,010
Shouldn't you be doing your nerd stuff with Magnus?

696
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,430
Do you know where Juli is?
Bad timing.

697
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,190
What is going on with you?

698
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,890
Marcella, please!

699
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:10,730
The last time I saw her,
she was with Jonas. Somewhere upstairs.

700
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,210
Kuhl?

701
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,720
Yes. You are so cool, sexy boy!

702
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,980
Okay, guys. Not today. Sorry.

703
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,780
We know.

704
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,790
It’s not like we didn't distance ourselves.

705
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,200
We know we can't fit in here.
Max, for example.

706
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:11,090
He has been trying to step
out of his father's shadow for years.

707
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,710
But he'll never be able to do it.

708
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,370
Hey, I wouldn’t say that now.

709
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,920
Or me...

710
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,130
I cut my finger off to prove how tough I am.

711
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,470
I’d probably die of an asthma attack,

712
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:25,350
if I ever had sex with a hot chick like you.

713
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:28,230
But we will never give up.
We will keep on fighting.

714
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,140
Because it doesn't matter
if you're lying on the floor,

715
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:35,560
It’s when you stop lying there,
and then you get up and...

716
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,100
How did it go?
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

717
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:39,320
Doesn't matter.

718
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,400
The only thing we both want,

719
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,990
is just a little spark of pity.

720
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,080
Okay?

721
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,080
Get in.

722
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:53,160
Come on, go!

723
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,920
That's' enough, okay?
That's enough.

724
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,930
Max, we need to look for the English men.

725
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:12,600
We're not here for fun... baby!

726
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,190
Man, we’ll never find them like this.

727
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,620
Wait a minute!

728
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,590
Max, stop dancing like a fool.
I've found our bride.

729
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,150
How about washing up?

730
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:08,830
You?
- Yes. We.

731
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:11,490
We want the bag back.

732
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:13,830
The fucking bag.

733
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:15,960
Oh. "The fucking bag".

734
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,590
Fucking yes.

735
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:21,340
You really are the ugliest bride in the world.

736
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,250
Now hand over the bag.

737
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,140
Why don't you try and fucking get it?

738
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:39,820
Fuck off!

739
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,860
Hey guys, we can...

740
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,400
Leave Berni alone!

741
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:28,900
Berni!

742
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,910
Berni, we have the bag.

743
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:34,780
Berni?

744
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:37,540
Berni, wake up!

745
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,270
Paul?

746
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,360
Hey.
- What?

747
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,520
What are you doing here?

748
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:10,950
No idea.

749
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:14,360
And where is Magnus?

750
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:16,530
Hey Paul, I'm talking to you.

751
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,460
That is my friend, Max!

752
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:21,910
Max!

753
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,670
Shit! Berni!

754
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:24,920
Max!

755
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,470
These are my friends! Max!

756
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,170
What happened to him?

757
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,710
So again: you got my brother drunk,
dragged him into a titty bar,

758
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:05,420
and now he's being held hostage by a drug dealer?

759
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:08,880
You know, the way you’re saying this sounds a lot more negative than it actually is.

760
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,090
You're completely out of your minds.
- Hello, Juli.

761
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:17,430
How stupid can you be
to take Magnus to a bar?

762
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:21,020
In the beginning it was actually quite funny.
Magnus is truly thawed.

763
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,810
Are you fucking kidding me?

764
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:26,230
Maybe you don't know him
as well as you think you do.
- Bullshit!

765
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:29,490
I trusted you. I thought you were different.

766
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,810
Bullshit.

767
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,320
I thought you were different.

768
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,780
You were just looking for an
idiot so that you could celebrate with Jonas.

769
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,370
You don’t give a fuck about me or Magnus.

770
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:43,750
If he weren’t your brother,
you’d make fun of him like everyone else.

771
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:47,250
Hey, hey. Easy, okay?

772
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,830
Comissioner Stanek.

773
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:52,720
I have a few questions.

774
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,550
What did you have to do with
these English men?

775
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:57,590
And where did you get the bag from?

776
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,390
So that was ...
- Paul! Let me. I was there.

777
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,020
So, the guy from the sex club...

778
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,900
...that I never met, because I wasn't there,

779
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,190
captured Magnus,

780
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:13,070
so that we could do a courier job for him.

781
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,320
Then Berni cut off his finger

782
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,950
and then suddenly the English guys came,

783
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:22,210
we already knew them from the bar
where Berni fought with the women...

784
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:26,960
Anyway,  we need the bag back to
give to that gangster boss.

785
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:31,090
You think you're very funny,don't you.
- No, not at all.

786
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:34,720
You have to help us free Magnus.
- I don't have to do anything.

787
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:39,510
All I know is that a bag full of
money was seized.

788
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:43,680
And that he has hospitalized
three English tourists.

789
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,560
They started it.
- Mhm.

790
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:50,350
We’re just here on a class trip.
Talk to our teacher.

791
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,380
Voicemail.

792
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:22,220
Now, you two are going to the precinct.

793
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:25,260
You can put it all on record.

794
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,060
Fucking shit!

795
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:38,200
Do you think we'll get reprimanded?
- No. What?

796
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,450
We have to save Magnus somehow.

797
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:42,910
All we have to do is get rid of the cops.

798
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:45,820
Yes, that's right.
Why didn't I think of that?

799
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:49,210
Because you don't play on
the computer that much.
On three.

800
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:50,660
What?
- Three!

801
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:55,970
Stop! Stop! Stop!

802
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:11,940
Max, Max, Max!

803
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:41,630
What are we going to do now?
- I don't know. You tell me.

804
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,840
I already had the idea of running away.

805
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,010
Berni always says you’re the one with the crazy plans.
- Yeah.

806
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:51,930
He only says that because he thinks I'm stupid, because I'm going to work for my dad.

807
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:56,150
I don't think that' is what he means.
More like it's a good thing.

808
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:58,400
Oh, yeah.

809
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:00,360
You lost something.

810
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,270
I didn't...

811
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,080
So I have an idea.

812
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,120
But is crazy.
And I don't mean it like it's a good thing.

813
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,560
Hello?

814
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:40,740
Hello, um...

815
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,110
We just wanted to ...

816
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:44,370
Hello?

817
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:49,860
Hello?

818
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,420
Hey!

819
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,460
What are you doing to Mama?

820
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:57,840
Branko.

821
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,590
Sorry, we just wanted ...

822
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,220
What do you want?

823
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,420
Max.

824
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:15,480
Not cheap.

825
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,730
We have almost nothing.
- "Almost nothing"? Hm...

826
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,190
Too bad.

827
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:31,290
Mama asks if you want to sell kidney?

828
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,450
What? No!

829
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,160
What do you get for it?

830
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:38,580
No, we...
have no kidneys to sell.

831
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:43,170
I... I can give you this watch.
It's real and Swiss-made.

832
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:45,050
Show Mama.

833
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,570
Mama likes watches.
- Can I maybe...get a receipt?

834
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:06,570
No!
- Ha.

835
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:08,280
Come along!

836
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:50,110
Ha-ha!

837
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:52,940
Best schooltrip ever!

838
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,340
Stand still.
- I can also drive in.

839
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,050
No, we’re just trying to scare them.

840
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:25,690
We want to pick up our friend.
- Where's the money?

841
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:28,950
Unfortunately, we no longer have that.
I'm sorry. Really.

842
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,780
We still want our friend.
Otherwise it will get ugly.

843
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:41,460
And?

844
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,840
You can fuck off with this junk.
What?

845
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,670
Max? Max? What’s going on?

846
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:59,470
I think he’s noticed that our
gun is sealed in the front.

847
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:08,480
Back! Back! Back!
- Yeah.

848
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,830
We hit something.
- My Mustang!

849
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,610
So what? We have a tank!

850
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,600
I think he's crying.

851
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:46,020
Pussy!

852
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,490
Uh-oh.
- What?

853
01:07:58,110 --> 01:07:59,660
Max!
Get out!

854
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,790
Uh...

855
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,630
Umm... sorry?

856
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:14,760
Now...its about to get ugly!

857
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,650
How...how did you find us?

858
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:39,410
People in Prague don't like it when
a tank drives through the city.

859
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:42,070
And now we’re going to the station.
- What?

860
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:45,710
We're going to the station now.
In the car.

861
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:48,170
No, no, no, no. Listen.

862
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:52,630
You can arrest us as soon
as this is over, but our friend is still in there.

863
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,090
So this weird story is true?

864
01:08:58,250 --> 01:08:59,470
Yes.

865
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:17,860
Don't worry, Magnus.
It's me, Paul.

866
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,700
We'll get you out of here.

867
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:22,080
Hello, everyone.

868
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,660
Magnus?
- That...

869
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:28,040
This is not our friend..
- This is your friend.

870
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,500
Glasses, looks funny, speaks funny.

871
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:34,170
Does he look like a friend of ours?
Man, he's ancient!

872
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:35,630
Sorry.

873
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,800
Jiri innocent.

874
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:42,010
What did you do to Magnus?
- Shit, Magnus crawled up my ass.

875
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:43,850
What did you say?

876
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:46,980
What are you going to do?
Game over.

877
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:48,850
Exactly.

878
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,200
Where's Magnus then?

879
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:11,170
No idea. We saw him come in.

880
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:14,380
Come with me!

881
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:16,370
Hello?

882
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:19,340
Excuse me!

883
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,970
Stop! Let me see the footage from midnight.

884
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:31,720
Stop! Play it from there.

885
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:50,750
Where did he go then?

886
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:53,580
I want to know
that too! Come with!

887
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:59,710
Yes, I remember. Very drunk, but polite.

888
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,300
Took him in.

889
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:05,470
And?
- Was very hungry.

890
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:07,470
I like to think so.

891
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,510
Umm... Okay, and then?

892
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,680
As I said. He was hungry and wanted to eat.

893
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:17,070
Ah, Hunger. I...I understand.

894
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:18,480
Yeah.

895
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,820
After, we had wonderful sex.

896
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:24,660
He was hungry.
And then, he went.

897
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:27,530
Okay. Thank you.

898
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,450
Goodbye
- Bye.

899
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:31,410
And?

900
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,710
Are you hungry?

901
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:41,760
Max!

902
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:16,120
Magnus must have come out
when we went through the back.

903
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:28,720
He is quite drunk, in a good mood and hungry.

904
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,260
And had amazing sex.

905
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:42,400
Looks closed, but...let's go over there.

906
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:53,700
Hello?

907
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,240
{Yes.

908
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:59,590
Excuse me, please.
We are looking for a friend.

909
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:04,300
I am not your friend.

910
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:06,840
No. I mean our friend.

911
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,130
He was here. Maybe three hours ago.

912
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,100
Small, drunk.

913
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,050
Funny looking.

914
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:15,850
Like an idiot.

915
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:17,770
An idiot?

916
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:19,110
Glasses?

917
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:20,560
Yeah! That's him.

918
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:24,530
I remember.
He had my fried cheese sandwich.

919
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:28,980
Very good Sandwich.

920
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:36,330
I think he was buying drugs.

921
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:38,990
Drugs?
Yes. But then--

922
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:46,670
Drugs.

923
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:55,980
God, you shit head.

924
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,890
Paul! Come on!

925
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,690
Come!

926
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:18,950
That's what happened.
- Thank you.

927
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,470
In Malaysia, drug smuggling
has the death penalty.

928
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,750
Magnus didn't smuggle drugs.
- I'm just saying.

929
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:34,470
Sometimes it would be better
if you just think some things.

930
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:36,730
Okay.

931
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:44,060
Your friend is at a police station in Vinohrady.

932
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,100
Can we see him?

933
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:48,940
You're really starting to get on my nerves.

934
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:33,070
Hello, Magnus.

935
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:36,910
Hello.

936
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,950
How are you? Everything okay?

937
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:45,550
I’m afraid I broke the law.

938
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:48,830
I'm so sorry. We shouldn't have given you alcohol.

939
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,090
You mean the potion?

940
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,970
Ha-ha.

941
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:56,460
Did you want to smuggle the drugs?

942
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:59,380
I wanted to help the poor man.

943
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:01,520
Because of his sick mother.

944
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,850
What sick mother?
- From the spiderman.

945
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:07,730
His Mama is very sick, so he has to sell drugs.

946
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:10,860
The man has a spider web all over his face.

947
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,440
Could I see the drugs Magnus bought?

948
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:25,080
I’m sorry, I don’t like you, Magnus.

949
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,040
I don't like you either.

950
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,200
Cool.

951
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:54,030
As I thought. You have to release Magnus.

952
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:55,280
And why would I do that?

953
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:59,570
Because they are not drugs,
but a medicine for asthma.

954
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:02,540
And how do you know that?

955
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,820
Because they belong to my friend.

956
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:08,750
And while we’re at it...

957
01:17:08,910 --> 01:17:11,410
There was something else in the bag with the money,

958
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:14,250
which I’m sure my friend would like to have back.

959
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:16,290
This one right here.

960
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,130
I'd like to go to the hotel now please.

961
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,220
Hello.

962
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:10,480
Hey! Hello.

963
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,810
Um ... Magnus is back at the hotel now.

964
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,480
Thank you.

965
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:23,950
What are you still doing here?

966
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:28,040
We thought it would be best if someone stayed here with Berni.

967
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,250
We?

968
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:35,380
After all,
we have known each other since primary school.

969
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,380
Who's that with Jonas?

970
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:40,920
That is probably Jonas' new crush.

971
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,930
Is that...isn't that a guy?

972
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:45,510
Yeah, why?

973
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:49,300
I thought...lately you and Jonas have been...

974
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:52,940
Jonas needed a good friend.
- Jonas has thousands of friends.

975
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,070
But apparently nobody

976
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:58,200
who he could have talked
about his coming out with.

977
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:00,740
Awesome.

978
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,120
Excuse me.
Can we go in now?

979
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,330
Yes, sure.

980
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:29,980
Shit, dude.
I'm sorry man.

981
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:39,070
Tithe...

982
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:40,320
What?

983
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:43,690
I have the Ti...

984
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:48,280
I-I have... I have the titthe...

985
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,620
I don't understand you.

986
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,660
I'm sorry?

987
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:57,080
Tiethen!

988
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,540
"Tiethen"?

989
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:02,540
Exactly.

990
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,890
Tits, man, from the nurse.
What?

991
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:09,680
When she was just above me,
I had them right in front of me.

992
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:12,850
I almost bit into them.
- Man, your such an arse!

993
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:28,820
Max, dude.
How did you deal with the English guys?

994
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:30,740
Boxed them away.

995
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:34,450
I thought you didn't like boxing.
- I thought so too.

996
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,550
Did you find it?
- Yes, and gave it to the doctor.

997
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:45,180
What you gave Magnus a doctor?

998
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:49,630
Yes.
And they said that they would sew it on you any moment now.

999
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,100
Dude, you are really are sick!

1000
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,060
Fine!

1001
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:32,890
Stop.

1002
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:51,320
Already awake?

1003
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,660
Uh ... yes. We just wanted ...

1004
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,250
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1005
01:21:57,410 --> 01:22:01,630
Twitter follower, check your Facebook,
E-Mails, Tweets,

1006
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,220
the whole lot. Your generation is...

1007
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:08,720
is so...boring.

1008
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:27,780
Morning.

1009
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:30,900
Morning.

1010
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:34,450
Mr. Graeser didn't actually
notice anything at all.

1011
01:22:34,610 --> 01:22:38,740
Magnus had prepared a detailed
report of our excursion for him,

1012
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:42,380
and we had to take the
bus home, the next day.

1013
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:46,460
That is so funny.

1014
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:48,670
You're very funny too, Magnus..
- Thank you.

1015
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:50,710
Stop writing for once!

1016
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,050
It's about gasoline consumption.

1017
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:55,340
- What?
- It's important.

1018
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:56,760
No, it's not.

1019
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:59,550
- Hey, were over here.
- Yeah.

1020
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:03,360
Dude, did you see Jonas?

1021
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:08,520
That asshole has only just come out
and he's managed to bag the horniest guy in all of Prague.

1022
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:11,660
Are you gay now?
- No, I'm just saying.

1023
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,660
- It's no fair.
- I should have gotten the sweater.

1024
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,200
I'll be right back.

1025
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,960
Hi.

1026
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:28,970
I just wanted to tell you,

1027
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,500
I acted like an idiot because I was jealous.

1028
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:36,010
I’ve been into you since first grade. It's true.

1029
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:38,930
And the other day,

1030
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:41,440
I would have liked if you went to the club with me.

1031
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,970
But then I took care of Magnus because...

1032
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:48,440
because I just can’t deny you any wish. So that's it.

1033
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,610
You can sit back here now.

1034
01:23:57,070 --> 01:24:00,290
You can sit here...I mean if you want to?

1035
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:02,620
Yes!

1036
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:04,830
Sorry, Marcella.

1037
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:14,180
Baby! The sun is coming out.

1038
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:17,310
"Baby" me one more time,
and you're going to get it!

1039
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:21,770
I know how you feel about me.
You waited at the hospital especially for me.

1040
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:25,430
Because I like to see you suffer.
- Whatever turns you on.

1041
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:31,280
So, you homos?
- What's going on?

1042
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:50,340
A lot has changed in Prague.

1043
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:53,250
Not the people - we've stayed the same.

1044
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:56,090
But what we know about each other has changed.

1045
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:59,350
And more importantly, what we know about ourselves.

1046
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:02,600
Now I know I don’t have to be
the most popular guy in school

1047
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,430
and I don't need five million Facebook friends.

1048
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,190
A couple of real friends is enough.

1049
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:11,150
And I know neither my father or school can tell me

1050
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:13,480
what to do with my life.

1051
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:15,900
I still don’t really know myself,

1052
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:19,530
but at least I know that for sure now.

1053
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,420
Where's you watch?

1054
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:31,960
I swapped it. With a tank.
- What? The watch from your grandfather.

1055
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:36,300
Best Representative 1973?! Which he passed
down to Best Representative 1988?!

1056
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:38,300
I didn't need it. I have a phone.

1057
01:25:58,770 --> 01:25:59,740
Here.

1058
01:26:02,187 --> 01:32:14,000
Subtitled by ItsDrewy :)

1059
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,620
Hello?

1060
01:32:18,570 --> 01:32:20,740
Is anyone coming?
