1
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:09,042
Gentlemen...

2
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:15,459
On behalf of the business community
in Kiangsu and Anhui

3
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:18,876
and the 9th Nanyang Revolutionary Army,

4
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:22,292
I nominate Ch'en Ch'i-mei as Military Governor

5
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:24,126
in charge of the Shanghai garrison.

6
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:40,167
I'm honoured by my comrades' nomination...

7
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:41,167
Objection!

8
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:46,751
I object!

9
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,084
From Hsu Hsi-lin to Ch'iu Chin,

10
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,917
members of the Restoration Society

11
00:02:53,084 --> 00:02:54,959
have sacrificed for the cause.

12
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:58,459
You're not qualified for the position!

13
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:00,084
Mr. T'ao,

14
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:04,417
to draw a line with Chinese United League

15
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,584
is inappropriate.

16
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:09,042
This is segregation!

17
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,084
You're not up for the task!

18
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:19,792
T'ao Ch'eng-Chang,

19
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,209
this is counter-revolutionary!

20
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:34,126
You have no right to label me!

21
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:35,292
I'm telling you,

22
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,334
even if Sun Yet-sen were here today

23
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:39,542
it's still unacceptable.

24
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:25,417
Under Emperor Shun-chih,

25
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:27,959
you needed a pigtail to keep your head.

26
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:31,792
Business was great back then.

27
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,584
Now, it's the exact opposite,

28
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,376
you'll lose your head if you wear a pigtail.

29
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:43,667
Recruiting for the New Army!

30
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:47,917
Join the New Revolutionary Army!

31
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:49,501
Hurry up and enrol!

32
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,292
Hurry up and enrol!

33
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,126
I repeat,

34
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:56,042
Join the New Army!

35
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:57,042
Join the revolution!

36
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,292
I'll sign up!

37
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,959
Dr. Sun's position is clear.

38
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:11,667
The Emperor's abdication is a prerequisite.

39
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,542
Peiyang Clique's bottom line is equally simple.

40
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,626
Yuan Shih-k'ai must become President

41
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:20,292
to counter the Ch'ing court
and force the Emperor to abdicate.

42
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:21,709
Dr. Sun made it clear,

43
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,542
end monarchy, stop the war

44
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:29,417
set up a republic, anything else is negotiable.

45
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:37,084
I ascended the throne at a young age,

46
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:42,792
during a time of great upheavals,

47
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:47,334
I understand the will of the people,

48
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:51,709
that honour and glory of one family

49
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:54,084
should not come before it.

50
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:58,542
I wish that people can live on in peace

51
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:03,584
- among all ethnic groups. - Your Majesty,

52
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,876
- Bringing everyone under one roof
- don't play with that in court.

53
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:08,584
- To form the Republic of China. - Why not?

54
00:08:09,584 --> 00:08:13,126
The Emperor will step down

55
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:18,001
and continue to enjoy a monarch's privileges

56
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,126
Don't cry,

57
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:22,001
and personally experience this new era

58
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,542
because you're the Emperor.

59
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:25,417
Which can only be great.

60
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:27,751
So decreed.

61
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:42,584
Thank you, Your Majesty.

62
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,792
Though I'm unfit to become President,

63
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:10,084
upon President Sun's recommendation,

64
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:12,334
and the support of all ethnic groups,

65
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,709
I shall do my best

66
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,459
to make the Republic of China strong.

67
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:27,459
We now live in a republic, no more "long live"...

68
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,167
"Joint Harmony" dates back to Chou Dynasty.

69
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:32,626
According to "Records of the Grand Historian"

70
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:35,542
during the regency under Dukes Shao and Chou

71
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:42,459
state affairs were discussed
until consensus was reached.

72
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:43,667
I see.

73
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,834
The Emperor is gone, now we can all have a say.

74
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:48,042
Forget it!

75
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:53,084
Tse-tung,

76
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,251
who do you think should be President?

77
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:57,834
Dr. Sun.

78
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:00,501
Then why did Yuan get the job?

79
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,834
Because he has guns.

80
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:14,209
Before Dr. Sun stepped down,

81
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:17,959
he pushed through the Provisional Constitution

82
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,126
which will become the foundation.

83
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,792
A new President won't change the Republic's fate.

84
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,001
Party politics is our platform.

85
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:31,376
We may have conceded a title,

86
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,584
but as long as we win the election,

87
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:36,501
we can appoint our own cabinet members.

88
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:39,417
I'm afraid he is too aggressive.

89
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:42,251
Gentlemen, the Presidency is symbolic,

90
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:45,501
he can be anybody, or nobody.

91
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:50,751
We must dismantle one party to build another.

92
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,042
Let's turn the faltering Chinese United League,

93
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:55,834
whose aim was to overthrow Ch'ing Dynasty,

94
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:57,751
into Kuomintang, a true nationalist party,

95
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:00,542
the foremost political party for the Republic.

96
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:16,292
Sir!

97
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:20,334
Party politics determines
the polity of the Republic,

98
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:22,167
you must take it seriously.

99
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:04,459
Here we are!

100
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:14,751
Conduct a democratic, non-violent election,

101
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:17,417
insist on fair competition,

102
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:19,876
unite the Party!

103
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,834
This is important, remember it well.

104
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,209
I Will.

105
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,167
Thank you.

106
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:26,709
I won't forget!

107
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:31,751
- Take care! - Take care!

108
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:34,376
- Take care! - Goodbye!

109
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:43,209
Chiao-jen!

110
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:47,834
I fear his thinking is too aggressive...

111
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:56,209
Chiao-jen!

112
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,959
Chiao-jen!

113
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,917
My mother...

114
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:23,417
lives on humble means.

115
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,917
- Chiao-jen! - When I die...

116
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,209
I count on you...

117
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,251
to look after her.

118
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:40,667
Chiao-jen!

119
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:49,334
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

120
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:53,084
Hang in there!

121
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:54,626
Hang in there, Chiao-jen!

122
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,751
- Hang in there. - Chiao-jen!

123
00:13:58,459 --> 00:13:59,501
Chiao-jen!

124
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:03,376
Chiao-jen!

125
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:55,959
At dawn on the day of the Sacrificial Rites,

126
00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:00,167
the President changes with officials in attendance

127
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:04,334
then lights the ceremonial pyre,
offers jade and satin,

128
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:08,042
offers roast meat, reads first prayer...

129
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:13,292
Shih-ch'ang, the entire country seems to have

130
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:14,626
different opinions on the polity.

131
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:17,459
It's either the Japanese absolute monarchy,

132
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,167
the French parliamentary system,

133
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:22,001
or the American presidential system.

134
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:23,626
Which is more suitable for us?

135
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:26,792
Japanese monarchy is outdated

136
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,792
for a republic like ours.

137
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,001
That's the crux of the problem,

138
00:15:33,626 --> 00:15:37,292
if we keep changing our minds,

139
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:39,417
we'll be neither here nor there.

140
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:40,917
What are you suggesting?

141
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:45,751
Follow Japan, adopt constitutional monarchy.

142
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,251
Had we persisted initially with that,

143
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,834
China would have been one of the Powers

144
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:55,459
and won't have to be bullied by foreign aggressors.

145
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:57,376
What about you, Yuan-hung?

146
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:03,376
Your wish is my command, Your Excellency.

147
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:10,167
Enough of rhetoric, this is now a Republic.

148
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:15,001
General Ts'ai!

149
00:16:20,584 --> 00:16:21,376
Ts'ai O!

150
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:25,876
What are you doing?

151
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,667
Sir, I...

152
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,667
You like that?

153
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:39,417
I'll send you some later.

154
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:41,959
Thank you.

155
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:49,251
What comes after the first prayer?

156
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:51,917
Second and third prayer,

157
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:54,292
then the burning of the sacrificial offerings,

158
00:16:55,667 --> 00:17:00,084
and everybody will bow in four directions.

159
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:11,834
Firstly, allow Japan to inherit

160
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:15,001
all German interests in Shantung

161
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:18,709
and agree not to cede or lease Shantung to others.

162
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:24,001
Secondly, Japanese subjects are permitted

163
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:28,292
into Southern Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia

164
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:31,542
to engage in commercial,
industrial and mining activities.

165
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:36,209
The leases on Port Arthur and Dalny,

166
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:39,167
and management of the Antung-Mukden Railway

167
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:42,334
shall be extended by 99 years.

168
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,542
That's daylight robbery!

169
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:51,167
Prime Minister Okuma must be out of his mind!

170
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:54,292
Is your Prime Minister out of his mind?

171
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:00,792
This document...

172
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,542
how can you explain to the Western Powers?

173
00:19:14,126 --> 00:19:15,417
This is confidential.

174
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:23,626
Both parties have a duty to keep it as such.

175
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:25,834
Sir,

176
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:30,376
whoever leaks the contents,

177
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:33,417
regardless of his esteemed position,

178
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:36,792
will be sanctioned by Japan.

179
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:38,417
Spare me this bullshit!

180
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:43,792
Even Ito Hirobumi dared not threaten me
when he was alive.

181
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,584
Who do you think you are?

182
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:51,292
Your Excellency,

183
00:19:56,959 --> 00:20:01,542
neither the late Ito-san

184
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:06,626
nor the Western Powers can save your skin.

185
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:10,084
Only we can do that.

186
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:15,459
Don't you want to be Emperor of China?

187
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,876
Have you heard?

188
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:29,959
Yuan Shih-k'ai accepted Japan's 21 Articles.

189
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:30,834
He's a traitor!

190
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:33,501
We're organising a protest, hurry...

191
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,959
Let's go, Tse-tung!

192
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:42,876
The strength of the Western Powers

193
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:45,459
lies in their ability to tolerate opposition.

194
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:49,292
In Chu Chih-hsin's

195
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:51,751
"An Introduction of German Social Revolutionaries"

196
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,251
he mentioned two western philosophers,

197
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:57,542
by the name of Marx and Engels.

198
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:58,459
Tu-hsiu!

199
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:00,167
Excuse me!

200
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:03,126
What is it?

201
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:04,459
Look!

202
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:17,917
What Yuan did was treacherous!

203
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:24,751
It's time we go home.

204
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:34,417
I heard you wish to restore monarchy.

205
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:37,376
Is that true?

206
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:45,251
Kuo-Chang, you're one of us, I'll level with you.

207
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:50,917
All founding emperors in history were under 50,

208
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:58,167
I'm almost 60, too old to have this ambition.

209
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:00,584
That's good!

210
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:05,001
Whoever wants to be Emperor,

211
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:09,001
will suffer the wrath of the nation.

212
00:22:13,126 --> 00:22:19,417
Sir, I must hurry back to Nanking, goodbye!

213
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:27,751
Having set the polity, with Heaven's mandate

214
00:22:28,084 --> 00:22:31,167
and the will of the people ascends to the throne

215
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:34,084
and rules.

216
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:39,626
By virtue of an unanimous vote,
the Representative Assembly of the Republic

217
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,876
is in favour of the President

218
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:45,001
in becoming the Emperor of China.

219
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,251
Long live the Emperor!

220
00:22:47,626 --> 00:22:50,501
Long live His Majesty!

221
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:58,334
I'm overwhelmed by your support.

222
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:06,084
I hear you insist on taking cold baths,

223
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:09,292
and advocate saving the country with able bodies.

224
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:10,459
I used to.

225
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:11,709
Not now?

226
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,209
I'm a bit lost.

227
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:19,167
With a weak country and inept Peiyang government,

228
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,376
able bodies are useless.

229
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,709
Guns and cannons against bows and arrows,

230
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:26,042
the outcome is obvious.

231
00:23:27,084 --> 00:23:28,584
Look what happened in Shantung.

232
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:31,542
You have the answer?

233
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:33,417
Not yet, sir.

234
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:38,001
Talk is cheap,

235
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,167
finding the way out

236
00:23:41,626 --> 00:23:43,792
may take a lifetime,

237
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:46,584
even generations.

238
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:47,834
Dad!

239
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:53,334
This is my daughter K'ai-hui,

240
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,084
this is Mao Tse-tung.

241
00:24:04,334 --> 00:24:05,626
You're so tall.

242
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:07,001
I'll go out and play.

243
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:12,167
The question I ask of you is

244
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:14,084
what do you really want?

245
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:52,584
Say goodbye to Feng-hsien!

246
00:25:06,376 --> 00:25:08,167
I wish I could bring you along.

247
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:10,292
Why don't you?

248
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:23,459
You pretended to support Yuan Shih-k'ai

249
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:25,376
so he'll let you go to Japan for treatment.

250
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:31,292
You don't want to arouse suspicion by taking me.

251
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:38,334
I only want to know, is a Courtesan

252
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:40,376
really that important?

253
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:52,792
Everyone knows

254
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:58,792
I'll forsake my country for my beloved.

255
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:08,042
Without me, who'll take care of you?

256
00:26:11,042 --> 00:26:14,709
Promise me you'll come back alive.

257
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:18,209
Unfortunately,

258
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:21,667
I've pledged this body and soul

259
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:28,292
to my country, not you.

260
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:52,167
Listen, you belong to 400 million Chinese

261
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,584
as well as to me, Hsiao Feng-hsien.

262
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:03,126
I know.

263
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:44,334
I appeal to all of you

264
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:48,209
to answer to a call of duty.

265
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:52,542
Should Yuan refuse to come to his senses,

266
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:56,751
he will be punished by an army of justice.

267
00:27:57,084 --> 00:27:58,917
An army of justice?

268
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:00,751
Well said!

269
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:04,876
But where's your army?

270
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,251
General Ts'ai is here, sir!

271
00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:13,542
Here comes my army!

272
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:18,792
You look so frail!

273
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,709
- Dr. Sun, I... - Take your time...

274
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:23,709
Have a seat!

275
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:32,917
Reviving the monarchy is a regression.

276
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:37,251
It's fatal to China. We must launch an expedition.

277
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:08,334
Commander-in-chief,

278
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:11,667
Captain Chu Te of the 6th detachment is here.

279
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:12,834
Go ahead.

280
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,792
Enemy troops defending Mienhuapo

281
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:18,626
are led by Wu of Peiyang's 6th Brigade.

282
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:21,126
Take the advance guard off duty,

283
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,334
let them rest.

284
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:24,584
We'll attack tomorrow at dawn.

285
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:28,001
We must capture Mienhuapo within a day.

286
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:28,917
Yes, sir!

287
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:32,834
Bring up all our heavy artillery.

288
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:38,417
Who the hell is their commander?

289
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:41,292
Wu P'ei-fu!

290
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:05,834
Son of a bitch!

291
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:23,209
What's going on here?

292
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:28,584
Feng Kuo-Chang and the generals just declared

293
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:30,751
their opposition to the new polity.

294
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:36,251
And the Military Governor Lu Jung-t'ing

295
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,251
has declared Kuanghsi independent.

296
00:30:42,251 --> 00:30:43,751
The country is in uproar!

297
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:48,876
Perhaps we should postpone the accession rites.

298
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:50,917
It's mere formality.

299
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:02,667
It now depends on Chen Huan and Ts'ao K'un,

300
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:06,709
if they can defeat Ts'ai O in Szechuan,

301
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:11,167
we might still have a chance.

302
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:38,542
Ts'ai is hounding me to my grave...

303
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:43,876
I'd high hopes for you, but you let me down.

304
00:37:50,126 --> 00:37:54,709
Mr. Fan Ching-Sheng, the Minister of Education

305
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:57,376
will now confer the letters of appointment.

306
00:38:06,376 --> 00:38:09,292
On behalf of the Ministry of Education

307
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:13,917
and the National Peking University Council,

308
00:38:16,209 --> 00:38:20,834
I appoint Ch'en Tu-hsiu
as Dean of the School of Letters,

309
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:30,501
Chu Hsi-chu as lecturer in Literature,

310
00:38:33,126 --> 00:38:37,334
Li Ta-Chao as Head Librarian,

311
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:44,167
and Ku Hung-ming as English Professor.

312
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:53,876
Isn't he the renowned academic?

313
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,917
Why does he dress like that?

314
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:19,292
What's so funny?

315
00:39:23,459 --> 00:39:25,542
I wear my pigtail at the back of my head,

316
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:29,417
those who laugh at me wear it in their hearts.

317
00:39:32,626 --> 00:39:37,626
Mine is visible,

318
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:43,084
yours is not.

319
00:39:46,126 --> 00:39:49,376
Feel free to enjoy it.

320
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,667
How dare you! This is the Senate,

321
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:41,501
the sacred ground of the Republic.

322
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:44,751
What sacred ground?

323
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:47,334
Just a bunch of pathetic scholars

324
00:40:47,584 --> 00:40:50,001
who are doomed to fail.

325
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:52,334
What do you mean, General?

326
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:55,209
I'm Peiyang's Joint Chief Military Governor,

327
00:40:55,626 --> 00:40:57,542
Chang Hsum is my name.

328
00:40:57,959 --> 00:41:02,084
I'm here to settle the dispute with the Senate,

329
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:07,084
Understand? I hereby proclaim

330
00:41:07,834 --> 00:41:09,459
effective immediately

331
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:14,376
this dump is closed, the party is over.

332
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:16,792
Understand?

333
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:18,917
The Senate is the Republic's legislative body,

334
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:20,751
you have no right to close it down.

335
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:24,834
Listen...

336
00:41:25,126 --> 00:41:26,167
I'm not only shutting down

337
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:29,126
this cackling dump of a Senate,

338
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:32,792
I'm also closing down

339
00:41:33,126 --> 00:41:35,417
your bloody Republic.

340
00:41:40,001 --> 00:41:43,917
Long live Your Majesty!

341
00:41:45,584 --> 00:41:46,959
You may rise.

342
00:41:47,376 --> 00:41:49,209
Thank you, Your Majesty.

343
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:51,126
Your Majesty!

344
00:41:54,834 --> 00:41:55,834
Your Majesty!

345
00:42:06,376 --> 00:42:12,292
I'm late, Your Majesty!

346
00:42:14,501 --> 00:42:16,751
You may look up when you speak.

347
00:42:19,209 --> 00:42:23,376
Without Your Majesty, the country is at a loss.

348
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,834
268 years of the glorious Ch'ing Dynasty

349
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:29,792
must not be ended by that Sun Yat-sen.

350
00:42:32,376 --> 00:42:37,042
They bullied you because you're a child.

351
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:43,959
They took advantage of your age.

352
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:56,626
Alright... I appoint you as my Cabinet Minister

353
00:42:57,209 --> 00:42:59,626
Viceroy of Zhili, Minister of Peiyang,

354
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:01,167
with the title of First Lord.

355
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:09,084
Thank you, Your Majesty.

356
00:43:10,584 --> 00:43:13,917
You may run three laps around the Palace.

357
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:20,042
His Majesty allows you to also fly a kite.

358
00:43:31,251 --> 00:43:32,292
It's flying!

359
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:33,834
Flying...

360
00:43:34,751 --> 00:43:35,792
Your Majesty,

361
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:37,709
Look!

362
00:43:43,126 --> 00:43:44,709
It's airborne!

363
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:05,126
Don't be scared. This is outrageous!

364
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:07,959
We still have a proclamation to make...

365
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:11,459
Don't force him to be Emperor,

366
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,084
we only want to be safe.

367
00:44:17,042 --> 00:44:18,167
Traitor!

368
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:20,459
I, Tuan Ch'i-jui, Premier of the Republic of China

369
00:44:20,626 --> 00:44:24,126
and Commander-in-Chief of the expedition force,

370
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:26,667
hereby condemn Chang Hsun and his clique

371
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:29,626
for forcibly dissolving the Senate,
holding the President hostage

372
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:33,084
and restoring monarchy.
Such action is contemptible

373
00:44:33,459 --> 00:44:35,792
and against the will of the people and Heaven.

374
00:44:36,584 --> 00:44:37,751
I, Tuan Ch'i-jui,

375
00:44:37,959 --> 00:44:40,584
resuming as Premier on President Li's instruction

376
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:45,584
will lead a punitive expedition
to crush the traitors.

377
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:47,917
July 2, this 6th year of the Republic.

378
00:44:50,126 --> 00:44:52,876
It's time for us students to take action.

379
00:44:53,042 --> 00:44:54,751
Go to Peking and rally against the restoration.

380
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:56,042
I don't understand.

381
00:44:56,459 --> 00:44:57,626
About what?

382
00:44:58,292 --> 00:45:00,959
By conceding the presidency to Yuan

383
00:45:01,126 --> 00:45:02,334
the Senate has made a fatal error.

384
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:03,459
The problem with China

385
00:45:03,626 --> 00:45:05,792
is not just about choosing the wrong President!

386
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:08,126
Isn't that a reason?

387
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:11,959
If all fault lies with the head of state,

388
00:45:12,542 --> 00:45:14,209
then the problems we had before

389
00:45:14,417 --> 00:45:16,334
were Yuan Shih-k'ai's fault.

390
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:19,084
But what about the restoration fiasco?

391
00:45:19,251 --> 00:45:20,959
Who should we blame?

392
00:45:27,334 --> 00:45:28,501
What are you getting at?

393
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,126
Today's China

394
00:45:30,459 --> 00:45:35,126
cannot be changed by having a
different Emperor or President.

395
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:40,126
An utmost humiliation!

396
00:45:41,626 --> 00:45:44,376
The Chinese race has been shamed!

397
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:54,167
Republic is a must and demanded by the people.

398
00:45:55,709 --> 00:46:00,209
Yet in a mere six years,

399
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:02,667
we already have two emperors.

400
00:46:03,876 --> 00:46:08,167
Remember, China is a republic,

401
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:10,834
to have an emperor in a republic

402
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:14,376
is so utterly ironic.

403
00:46:14,709 --> 00:46:18,876
Bravo!

404
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:24,042
The Republic champions freedom,
equality and philanthropy.

405
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:26,417
Yet, since the founding of the Republic,

406
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:29,251
equality has been ignored, freedom trampled on,

407
00:46:29,417 --> 00:46:31,751
philanthropy does not exist.

408
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:34,876
Lives were lost and blood was shed

409
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:38,001
in exchange for a republic in name only.

410
00:46:38,292 --> 00:46:40,626
That is intolerable!

411
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:43,959
Is this the Republic

412
00:46:44,126 --> 00:46:46,292
people have sacrificed for?

413
00:46:46,709 --> 00:46:50,542
It is unacceptable legally and to the Assembly,

414
00:46:50,709 --> 00:46:53,209
and to the 400 million Chinese subjects.

415
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:04,751
Down with Chang Hsun!

416
00:47:04,917 --> 00:47:08,084
Down with P'u-yi!

417
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:11,584
Down with Chang Hsun!

418
00:47:11,751 --> 00:47:14,792
Down with P'u-yi!

419
00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:18,751
Down with Chang Hsun! Down with P'u-yi!

420
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:25,626
Despite the 1911 Revolution
and the rallying cry for the Republic,

421
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:32,792
people still worship Confucius

422
00:47:32,959 --> 00:47:35,251
without learning the essence of democratic freedom.

423
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:40,126
Looking back over history for the past decades,

424
00:47:41,126 --> 00:47:44,084
each time there's a failed republican movement,

425
00:47:44,292 --> 00:47:46,584
monarchism will make another comeback.

426
00:47:47,042 --> 00:47:50,334
Just like Yuan and Chang's attempts to restore.

427
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:54,667
Fellow students!

428
00:47:55,126 --> 00:48:00,751
Feudalism and the republic are incompatible.

429
00:48:01,376 --> 00:48:04,209
To keep one, the other must be destroyed.

430
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:09,126
In order for this country to be strong,

431
00:48:09,459 --> 00:48:12,167
we must first remove this ancient burden

432
00:48:12,459 --> 00:48:16,501
from the hearts of the people.

433
00:48:52,084 --> 00:48:55,876
You're shamelessly boastful, Mr. Ch'en.

434
00:48:56,709 --> 00:49:00,751
You praise New Culture and bury the old

435
00:49:01,626 --> 00:49:07,834
and blame all our troubles on Confucianism.

436
00:49:08,001 --> 00:49:12,584
What did Confucius do 2,000 years ago

437
00:49:12,834 --> 00:49:14,876
that is damaging today?

438
00:49:15,667 --> 00:49:18,167
Mr. Ku, as an erudite scholar,

439
00:49:18,334 --> 00:49:21,709
can't you see what Confucius advocated then

440
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,126
is not applicable to us today?

441
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:25,876
What Confucius taught us

442
00:49:26,042 --> 00:49:28,709
is like arithmetics.

443
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:32,709
2,000 years ago, 3 x 3 = 9. It still is today.

444
00:49:32,876 --> 00:49:34,584
It will never be 8.

445
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:37,584
Blaming your miscalculations

446
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:42,376
on the person who invented arithmetics is absurd.

447
00:49:42,584 --> 00:49:47,209
If you call that New Culture, it's bullshit.

448
00:49:49,251 --> 00:49:52,251
Clearly a talent despite his quibbling!

449
00:49:55,667 --> 00:49:58,667
Culture needs reforms

450
00:49:59,084 --> 00:50:00,876
to keep up with time.

451
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:05,001
Some say classical Chinese is refined

452
00:50:05,417 --> 00:50:09,334
while vernacular Chinese is vulgar.

453
00:50:09,792 --> 00:50:13,626
But imperial examination system was harmful.

454
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:16,417
Even the best written eight-legged essays

455
00:50:16,751 --> 00:50:20,376
were detached from society and impractical.

456
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:24,542
They're useless except in examinations.

457
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:27,626
Our country needs talents,

458
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:31,292
pragmatism will make us strong.

459
00:50:31,459 --> 00:50:33,917
I represent the Women's College of Education,

460
00:50:34,126 --> 00:50:36,792
I think classical Chinese is more concise.

461
00:50:36,959 --> 00:50:37,959
That's a fact!

462
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:39,876
Please cite an example.

463
00:50:41,584 --> 00:50:44,542
Take the phrase "unable to do it"

464
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:47,792
Isn't it more concise in classical Chinese?

465
00:50:48,667 --> 00:50:51,709
That's four words.

466
00:50:52,042 --> 00:50:55,251
You use only three in vernacular Chinese.

467
00:50:55,667 --> 00:50:56,542
Such as?

468
00:50:57,126 --> 00:50:58,501
"Can't be done!"

469
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:01,834
Bravo!

470
00:51:07,959 --> 00:51:11,376
Before the 1911 Revolution,
we modelled after Japan.

471
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:14,001
But it doesn't appear to be working.

472
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:16,876
Japan's Meiji Restoration was inspired by the West.

473
00:51:17,626 --> 00:51:20,417
Why don't we learn from the teacher
but choose to follow the student?

474
00:51:20,709 --> 00:51:23,417
It's not about Japanese or Americans.

475
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:26,084
It's a matter of new versus old culture.

476
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:28,001
To strengthen the country and enlighten its people,

477
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:30,917
we must abolish the old and popularize the new.

478
00:51:31,334 --> 00:51:35,001
That's how our nation can be re-born.

479
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:36,501
Who should we learn from?

480
00:51:37,001 --> 00:51:38,876
Whether it's the U.S., France

481
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:41,042
Japan, or even Russia.

482
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:43,667
- Learn from whoever can help China.
- Russia?

483
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:46,917
That's absurd!

484
00:51:47,084 --> 00:51:49,417
The governance of any country in the world

485
00:51:49,751 --> 00:51:53,417
is a way of thinking that stems
from its own culture.

486
00:51:53,709 --> 00:51:54,751
Look at the world,

487
00:51:55,209 --> 00:51:57,959
taking a macro view of the future of humanity,

488
00:51:58,126 --> 00:51:59,334
is not absurd at all.

489
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:05,084
There's a man in Russia called Lenin,

490
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:09,042
who succeeded with the Bolshevik revolution.

491
00:52:09,834 --> 00:52:11,251
The ideology he introduced

492
00:52:11,417 --> 00:52:13,626
is Marxism from Germany.

493
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:15,626
What is Bolshevik?

494
00:52:16,209 --> 00:52:18,751
Bolshevik means majority.

495
00:52:19,376 --> 00:52:23,667
What is majority? Peasants and workers.

496
00:52:23,834 --> 00:52:27,417
The many millions of oppressed labourers.

497
00:52:27,584 --> 00:52:30,084
The success of Russia

498
00:52:30,334 --> 00:52:32,334
is a victory for Bolshevism,

499
00:52:32,501 --> 00:52:35,417
common people and the proletariat,

500
00:52:35,584 --> 00:52:38,084
for the first time ever in the history of mankind,

501
00:52:38,501 --> 00:52:40,792
and also the greatest.

502
00:52:40,917 --> 00:52:42,292
Bravo!

503
00:52:45,626 --> 00:52:46,417
Bravo!

504
00:53:21,292 --> 00:53:23,959
Peiyang is up for grabs after Yuan's death.

505
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:26,084
Tuan Ch'i-jui used Chang Hsun
to get rid of Li Yuan-hung,

506
00:53:26,251 --> 00:53:27,292
then he took out Chang Hsun.

507
00:53:27,459 --> 00:53:29,376
Now he's using Wu P'ei-fu against Dr. Sun.

508
00:53:29,542 --> 00:53:30,834
There's no end to this war.

509
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:33,626
If this continues, Hu'nan will be in ruins.

510
00:53:33,876 --> 00:53:36,334
What about the Constitutional Protection Movement?

511
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:37,834
To succeed, Dr. Sun must launch
a northern expedition,

512
00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:39,959
and Hu'nan will bear the brunt.

513
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:42,251
KMT should be stronger than the Peiyang Clique.

514
00:53:42,501 --> 00:53:43,459
By some distance.

515
00:53:43,626 --> 00:53:45,292
But in-fighting among various factions

516
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:47,584
makes KMT vulnerable.

517
00:53:47,834 --> 00:53:49,251
What's your view?

518
00:53:49,417 --> 00:53:52,001
Declare Hu'nan autonomous.

519
00:53:58,917 --> 00:53:59,834
Sir...

520
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:04,042
Sir...

521
00:54:06,334 --> 00:54:09,501
He's in a bad mood, I'm so sorry.

522
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:11,876
First the south, then the north.

523
00:54:12,501 --> 00:54:16,209
Now it's north against south! There's no end to it!

524
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:19,542
There's no end to this revolution

525
00:54:22,084 --> 00:54:24,709
You-jen, what are we missing?

526
00:54:25,292 --> 00:54:26,626
Madam, same as before,

527
00:54:27,251 --> 00:54:30,209
no money, no guns, no troops.

528
00:54:34,251 --> 00:54:34,959
Fellow students,

529
00:54:35,126 --> 00:54:37,834
I believe France is the hub
of European civilisation,

530
00:54:38,001 --> 00:54:40,709
the standard-bearer of modern revolution,
and a model for global revolution.

531
00:54:40,876 --> 00:54:41,792
Then let's go to France.

532
00:54:41,959 --> 00:54:42,834
But...

533
00:54:43,126 --> 00:54:45,501
to go abroad

534
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:48,209
we need money.

535
00:54:48,376 --> 00:54:49,876
We'll raise it.

536
00:54:50,209 --> 00:54:52,376
Let's split up,

537
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:54,542
Peking, Shanghai and Canton.

538
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:56,876
Tse-tung, where do you want to go?

539
00:54:57,292 --> 00:54:58,209
Peking.

540
00:54:58,959 --> 00:54:59,917
Peking?

541
00:55:01,709 --> 00:55:06,501
I can visit Mr. Yang at Peking University.

542
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:48,292
Which faculty are you from?

543
00:55:50,001 --> 00:55:51,834
My name is Mao Tse-tung, sir, graduate of

544
00:55:52,001 --> 00:55:53,542
First Provincial Normal School of Hu'nan.

545
00:55:53,709 --> 00:55:55,417
I'm visiting, came across your class,

546
00:55:55,584 --> 00:55:56,876
and took the liberty of sitting in.

547
00:55:57,792 --> 00:56:00,834
Mr. Mao, not that I won't let you,

548
00:56:01,001 --> 00:56:03,001
but Peking University has its rules.

549
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:05,209
I'm a great admirer of yours,

550
00:56:05,376 --> 00:56:07,209
I only wish to sit in for one session.

551
00:56:07,376 --> 00:56:08,834
I'll leave quietly afterwards.

552
00:56:12,292 --> 00:56:13,042
Take a seat.

553
00:56:14,709 --> 00:56:15,542
Thank you.

554
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:18,626
The university is not a sanctuary,

555
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,959
anyone not properly dressed won't be admitted.

556
00:56:22,126 --> 00:56:23,792
That's the rule here!

557
00:56:24,709 --> 00:56:25,584
In any case,

558
00:56:26,001 --> 00:56:27,251
because of Hu Shih's huge reputation

559
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,334
I don't want to miss his lecture.

560
00:56:35,417 --> 00:56:38,459
What brings you to Peking?

561
00:56:39,126 --> 00:56:40,792
To raise money for my alumni to go to France.

562
00:56:43,542 --> 00:56:44,501
Ta-Chao.

563
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:46,834
This student of mine...

564
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:48,334
what should we do with him?

565
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:49,834
You're...

566
00:56:52,417 --> 00:56:54,584
Mr. Li Ta-Chao?

567
00:56:56,626 --> 00:56:58,334
I need an assistant.

568
00:56:59,042 --> 00:57:00,626
Are you willing to work hard?

569
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:01,834
Absolutely!

570
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,084
I'll do anything anytime.

571
00:57:04,376 --> 00:57:05,501
8 silver dollars a month.

572
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:06,626
That's plenty.

573
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:08,667
More than I make as a soldier.

574
00:57:08,834 --> 00:57:09,917
You're a soldier?

575
00:57:11,501 --> 00:57:12,667
Yes, but never went to war.

576
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:36,876
Close the door, thank you.

577
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:49,876
You are...

578
00:57:50,084 --> 00:57:51,542
It's me!

579
00:57:57,834 --> 00:57:58,709
K'ai-hui!

580
00:58:19,084 --> 00:58:22,667
Today, we leave for the Paris Peace Conference.

581
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:26,292
For the first time in 100 years,

582
00:58:26,459 --> 00:58:29,584
China shows up on international stage as a victor.

583
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:33,251
We won't let our nation down!

584
00:58:33,417 --> 00:58:35,834
Let's brace ourselves

585
00:58:36,209 --> 00:58:38,667
and demand for the return of Shantung.

586
00:58:38,834 --> 00:58:41,001
Unite...

587
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:44,209
and China shall prevail!

588
00:58:44,376 --> 00:58:47,251
Justice shall prevail!

589
00:58:47,459 --> 00:58:50,126
Look! Behind us

590
00:58:50,292 --> 00:58:51,792
are 400 million Chinese.

591
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:56,459
But a weak nation lacks diplomatic clout.

592
00:58:57,459 --> 00:59:01,042
We shall join you in Paris later.

593
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:04,626
My words carry little weight,

594
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:07,417
but I'll do my best for the Republic.

595
00:59:08,001 --> 00:59:11,126
Unite...

596
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:14,042
Justice shall prevail!

597
00:59:15,709 --> 00:59:18,167
Sir, I once thought

598
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:21,167
our nation can be saved by strong mind and body,

599
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:23,584
or even by Kropotkin's anarchism.

600
00:59:24,084 --> 00:59:26,792
But these solutions now seem superficial.

601
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:29,584
I read your review on Marxism

602
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:32,459
I think that is the truth.

603
00:59:32,834 --> 00:59:36,084
My article is a mere glimpse of Marxism.

604
00:59:36,292 --> 00:59:38,501
It's a fraction of what it is about.

605
00:59:38,876 --> 00:59:41,001
You should study "The Communist Manifesto"

606
00:59:41,209 --> 00:59:44,084
and its theory of a proletariat revolution.

607
00:59:45,126 --> 00:59:47,751
That's the truth.

608
00:59:50,834 --> 00:59:52,167
"The Communist Manifesto"

609
00:59:55,501 --> 00:59:58,209
I forgot today is New Year's eve.

610
00:59:58,376 --> 01:00:00,251
Stay for dinner.

611
01:00:01,209 --> 01:00:02,001
Sir!

612
01:00:03,001 --> 01:00:04,042
I still have work to do.

613
01:00:31,709 --> 01:00:33,001
It's dad's prescribed hours!

614
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:34,376
We can now eat New Year dinner.

615
01:00:34,542 --> 01:00:35,376
Great!

616
01:00:40,042 --> 01:00:42,167
Wipe your hands!

617
01:00:46,917 --> 01:00:48,376
Victory of the common people?

618
01:00:49,042 --> 01:00:51,876
Didn't Uncle Li write this?

619
01:00:52,126 --> 01:00:55,959
Yes, it's about the Russian revolution.

620
01:00:56,292 --> 01:00:58,917
How is it different?

621
01:00:59,959 --> 01:01:02,626
Most revolutions are led by the elite.

622
01:01:03,042 --> 01:01:04,751
But in Mr. Li's thesis,

623
01:01:04,917 --> 01:01:07,709
Russian revolution is a victory
of the common people.

624
01:01:08,292 --> 01:01:09,501
Common people?

625
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:11,084
Let's have a drink.

626
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,251
I don't drink.

627
01:01:14,001 --> 01:01:15,584
Just one, for the New Year.

628
01:01:18,251 --> 01:01:19,042
Alright.

629
01:01:35,126 --> 01:01:36,626
Let's go watch the fireworks.

630
01:01:38,334 --> 01:01:39,876
Hurry up!

631
01:01:40,959 --> 01:01:41,876
Coming...

632
01:02:36,709 --> 01:02:40,209
Shantung is the cradle of Chinese civilisation,

633
01:02:40,376 --> 01:02:42,501
great thinkers like Confucius and Mencius

634
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:44,667
were born in Shantung.

635
01:02:44,834 --> 01:02:46,501
China cannot lose Shantung,

636
01:02:47,126 --> 01:02:52,459
like the West can't be without Jerusalem.

637
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:58,417
Concerning the problem of Shantung,

638
01:02:59,459 --> 01:03:09,126
the governments have already
signed a treaty of 21 Articles.

639
01:03:09,292 --> 01:03:16,459
So it is not necessary to discuss
it in this conference.

640
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,001
At the Paris Peace Conference,

641
01:03:19,209 --> 01:03:21,042
Japan proposed that German concessions in Shantung

642
01:03:21,209 --> 01:03:22,709
should be transferred to them permanently.

643
01:03:23,876 --> 01:03:24,751
As expected.

644
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:25,709
Hu Shih and I

645
01:03:25,876 --> 01:03:27,626
intend to write to President Wilson,

646
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:29,167
and force him to mediate.

647
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:32,626
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

648
01:03:34,834 --> 01:03:37,709
That's Yang's student, Mao Tse-tung.

649
01:03:38,501 --> 01:03:40,001
Tse-tung, please come down.

650
01:03:41,084 --> 01:03:43,209
Japan's ambition in China

651
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:45,959
is clearly a threat to American interests.

652
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:47,917
Wilson must do something.

653
01:03:48,209 --> 01:03:49,084
Mr. Ch'en,

654
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:51,459
if Japan refuses to withdraw its troops,

655
01:03:51,584 --> 01:03:53,084
will the U.S. send its fleet

656
01:03:53,251 --> 01:03:55,501
to Kiautschou Bay for us?

657
01:03:55,667 --> 01:03:57,001
So Wilson's Fourteen-Points

658
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:58,084
is bullshit?

659
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:01,459
He's right. Between Japan and China,

660
01:04:01,626 --> 01:04:03,876
the Powers can only choose to support one.

661
01:04:04,042 --> 01:04:07,084
They have never backed us in the past.

662
01:04:07,459 --> 01:04:08,917
They supported Japan

663
01:04:09,126 --> 01:04:11,376
because they wanted her to contain Russia.

664
01:04:11,542 --> 01:04:14,334
They need to contain Russia now more than ever,

665
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:15,709
don't they?

666
01:04:21,751 --> 01:04:23,209
Thank you, comrades!

667
01:04:33,251 --> 01:04:34,084
Sending you to Peking

668
01:04:34,251 --> 01:04:36,292
is to raise money,

669
01:04:36,792 --> 01:04:40,334
but you spent your time reading in the library.

670
01:04:41,292 --> 01:04:43,501
He's a genuine bookworm.

671
01:04:44,959 --> 01:04:47,209
We can't go to France without money.

672
01:04:47,376 --> 01:04:49,709
Going back to Hu'nan empty handed

673
01:04:49,876 --> 01:04:51,167
is so humiliating.

674
01:04:58,251 --> 01:04:59,501
A cashier's cheque

675
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:02,751
for 20,000 silver dollars!

676
01:05:03,042 --> 01:05:03,959
Where did you get this?

677
01:05:04,792 --> 01:05:07,167
Chang Shih-Chao raised it at Mr. Yang's request.

678
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:10,001
Mao Tse-tung...

679
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:11,376
You left me speechless!

680
01:05:11,542 --> 01:05:12,959
Do I have to pay it back?

681
01:05:13,584 --> 01:05:14,417
Of course!

682
01:05:15,792 --> 01:05:16,834
I'm going back to Hu'nan tonight

683
01:05:17,001 --> 01:05:18,334
to make plans for France.

684
01:05:18,834 --> 01:05:22,334
I need to stay on for a while.

685
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:26,542
You're not going?

686
01:05:29,751 --> 01:05:32,917
Are you courting each other?

687
01:05:33,959 --> 01:05:35,542
I have to go now!

688
01:05:38,001 --> 01:05:39,167
Money!

689
01:05:43,501 --> 01:05:44,751
Do you have to go?

690
01:05:45,501 --> 01:05:46,584
I made a promise.

691
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:51,001
Will you come back?

692
01:05:53,792 --> 01:05:57,751
Of course, the reason why I'm going

693
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:00,917
is to bring back more advanced learnings.

694
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:07,126
Mr. Yang is here,

695
01:06:08,376 --> 01:06:09,709
Mr. Li, too,

696
01:06:11,251 --> 01:06:12,292
and...

697
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:20,959
you.

698
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:32,167
Before I leave, I want to visit my parents.

699
01:06:33,917 --> 01:06:36,917
If you don't come back,

700
01:06:37,251 --> 01:06:39,167
I'll look for you in France.

701
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:19,667
Bad news from Paris!

702
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:23,501
We just got word,

703
01:07:23,709 --> 01:07:25,959
the person who signed the loan agreement

704
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:27,376
with Japan last September

705
01:07:27,542 --> 01:07:29,376
was Chang Tsung-hsiang, our envoy to Japan.

706
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:30,834
Chang Tsung-hsiang!

707
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:32,209
Traitor!

708
01:07:33,459 --> 01:07:36,459
Something tumultuous is about to happen.

709
01:07:36,751 --> 01:07:37,959
Because of the Peace Conference?

710
01:07:38,126 --> 01:07:39,084
Yes!

711
01:07:41,209 --> 01:07:43,959
If we succeed, the nation will rejoice.

712
01:07:44,334 --> 01:07:45,459
If we fail...

713
01:07:45,709 --> 01:07:48,001
Nationalism suppressed for centuries

714
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:49,834
will erupt like a volcano.

715
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,334
What should we do?

716
01:07:53,376 --> 01:07:55,334
Just go with the flow.

717
01:07:59,251 --> 01:08:01,209
We'll turn this world upside down.

718
01:08:04,584 --> 01:08:08,292
Extra! Diplomatic failure in Paris!

719
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:12,251
Extra! Paris peace talk collapses...

720
01:08:12,792 --> 01:08:13,626
Today,

721
01:08:13,834 --> 01:08:16,751
Japan's conspiracy to take over Shantung

722
01:08:16,917 --> 01:08:18,167
is about to succeed

723
01:08:18,834 --> 01:08:20,792
due to our diplomatic failure.

724
01:08:22,126 --> 01:08:24,209
If Shantung were taken by Japan,

725
01:08:24,584 --> 01:08:27,334
our territorial integrity will be compromised,

726
01:08:28,542 --> 01:08:31,792
and the nation will perish.

727
01:08:33,792 --> 01:08:36,917
What should we do now?

728
01:08:37,584 --> 01:08:40,917
Stage protests at foreign legation.

729
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:42,501
Calm down!

730
01:08:42,876 --> 01:08:45,334
Don't lose sight of our objective!

731
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:47,042
We just want to be patriotic.

732
01:08:47,376 --> 01:08:49,542
We're doing this to pressure
the Peiyang government.

733
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:51,167
Reclaim our sovereignty in Shandong.

734
01:08:52,751 --> 01:08:56,001
All along,

735
01:08:56,167 --> 01:08:58,792
we deluded ourselves into thinking

736
01:08:59,542 --> 01:09:02,292
when the war is over

737
01:09:02,501 --> 01:09:05,084
the Western Powers will help us.

738
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:07,042
Now we know

739
01:09:07,959 --> 01:09:09,376
we have been betrayed

740
01:09:09,542 --> 01:09:11,917
by the rhetoric of politicians at Versailles,

741
01:09:12,459 --> 01:09:13,376
by the Western Powers

742
01:09:13,542 --> 01:09:16,584
who are too busy carving up Europe to care.

743
01:09:17,834 --> 01:09:19,126
And our government

744
01:09:19,542 --> 01:09:23,042
had wanted to sign this humiliating treaty.

745
01:09:24,792 --> 01:09:30,542
A historic moment is upon us.

746
01:09:43,917 --> 01:09:46,709
Fellow students, take to the streets!

747
01:09:53,042 --> 01:09:56,751
Return Tsingtao!

748
01:09:56,917 --> 01:10:00,042
Defend our sovereignty!

749
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:02,251
Return Tsingtao!

750
01:10:02,417 --> 01:10:03,667
Defend our sovereignty!

751
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:06,376
Return Tsingtao!

752
01:10:06,584 --> 01:10:09,084
This is Wilson's so-called truth and justice!

753
01:10:09,251 --> 01:10:12,501
The Western Powers betrayed us in Paris.

754
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,334
They betrayed China!

755
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:16,376
Betrayed 400 million Chinese!

756
01:10:16,542 --> 01:10:18,334
Betrayed truth and justice!

757
01:10:19,126 --> 01:10:21,042
Something so painfully obvious

758
01:10:21,334 --> 01:10:23,542
but overlooked by the Peiyang government!

759
01:10:24,292 --> 01:10:26,042
This Peiyang government

760
01:10:26,292 --> 01:10:28,709
that can tolerate such humiliation

761
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:31,459
is not fit to govern us!

762
01:10:31,751 --> 01:10:34,084
They are Western Powers' accomplices,

763
01:10:34,376 --> 01:10:36,084
running dogs of the Japanese pirates!

764
01:10:36,251 --> 01:10:40,292
In time of crisis, stand up and be counted!

765
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:44,209
Today, we want an eye for an eye,

766
01:10:44,917 --> 01:10:48,001
a tooth for a tooth!

767
01:10:48,501 --> 01:10:51,876
President Wilson is a scoundrel!

768
01:10:52,251 --> 01:10:53,751
He deceived us!

769
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,459
He insulted us!

770
01:10:57,251 --> 01:10:59,084
He toyed with us!

771
01:11:00,626 --> 01:11:02,167
What should we do now?

772
01:11:02,626 --> 01:11:03,501
Fellow countrymen,

773
01:11:03,917 --> 01:11:07,459
Today, we shall petition President Hsu

774
01:11:08,001 --> 01:11:10,334
and also the Premier.

775
01:11:10,792 --> 01:11:13,751
We want people to know about the Paris conspiracy.

776
01:11:13,959 --> 01:11:16,501
We want them to know our demands.

777
01:11:16,751 --> 01:11:17,792
Whoever it is

778
01:11:17,959 --> 01:11:20,834
who tries to wipe us out

779
01:11:21,167 --> 01:11:23,917
will face a bloody battle!

780
01:11:24,209 --> 01:11:25,417
Pay with blood!

781
01:11:25,584 --> 01:11:28,042
Fight to the end!

782
01:11:28,209 --> 01:11:30,001
Return Tsingtao!

783
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:31,459
Today's rally

784
01:11:31,626 --> 01:11:35,459
is a harbinger of China's bright future.

785
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:39,542
So, this very moment, this very day...

786
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:43,626
I'm proud and honoured to be a part of

787
01:11:43,792 --> 01:11:47,459
this unprecedented revolution.

788
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:50,876
Return our sovereignty!

789
01:11:51,042 --> 01:11:58,251
Punish the traitors!

790
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:11,959
Students have taken to the streets,

791
01:12:12,084 --> 01:12:13,417
they're heading for the Legation Quarter.

792
01:12:14,959 --> 01:12:16,917
Ignorant, naive and stupid!

793
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:19,292
Send police to stop them!

794
01:12:19,709 --> 01:12:20,376
Yes, sir!

795
01:12:20,542 --> 01:12:23,084
Fight to the end!

796
01:12:23,251 --> 01:12:25,459
Patriotism is not a crime!

797
01:12:25,626 --> 01:12:27,959
Fight to the end!

798
01:12:28,126 --> 01:12:30,292
Patriotism is not a crime!

799
01:12:30,459 --> 01:12:32,792
Fight to the end!

800
01:12:33,251 --> 01:12:34,292
Fellow students!

801
01:12:34,667 --> 01:12:38,251
T'an Ssu-t'ung said
"successful reforms come with bloodshed",

802
01:12:38,501 --> 01:12:42,542
So let bloodshed and sacrifice begin with us!

803
01:12:42,709 --> 01:12:48,751
Charge!

804
01:12:51,542 --> 01:12:58,959
Come out!

805
01:13:02,417 --> 01:13:03,376
Young lady!

806
01:13:03,792 --> 01:13:05,792
Take your grievances to the prosecutors!

807
01:13:06,417 --> 01:13:08,376
You've come to the wrong place!

808
01:13:09,542 --> 01:13:14,084
My grievances are beyond the prosecutors!

809
01:13:14,584 --> 01:13:15,792
What do you mean?

810
01:13:18,209 --> 01:13:22,667
I'm pleading for 400 million Chinese.

811
01:13:22,834 --> 01:13:29,709
Come out!

812
01:13:29,876 --> 01:13:31,334
Return Tsingtao!

813
01:13:31,501 --> 01:13:34,167
Hand over the traitors!

814
01:13:34,334 --> 01:13:36,834
Return Tsingtao!

815
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:39,667
Hand over the traitors!

816
01:13:39,834 --> 01:13:41,417
Return Tsingtao!

817
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:44,626
Hand over the traitors!

818
01:13:45,251 --> 01:13:47,126
Charge!

819
01:13:47,334 --> 01:13:50,167
Charge!

820
01:13:56,584 --> 01:13:59,334
Go inside and grab the traitors!

821
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:02,042
Open up...

822
01:14:02,209 --> 01:14:04,459
Open the door!

823
01:14:29,042 --> 01:14:30,709
We were under siege in Japan,

824
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:33,376
it's happening here as well!

825
01:14:35,334 --> 01:14:37,959
Don't cry!

826
01:14:38,376 --> 01:14:40,876
Look, Ping-hsiang!

827
01:14:41,542 --> 01:14:43,876
Don't worry, I'm here.

828
01:14:46,459 --> 01:14:47,376
3 Bamboos!

829
01:15:00,917 --> 01:15:02,501
K'uang Hu-Sheng, bravo!

830
01:15:03,126 --> 01:15:09,709
Jump!

831
01:15:09,876 --> 01:15:10,876
Jump inside!

832
01:15:19,376 --> 01:15:20,417
Soldiers!

833
01:15:22,334 --> 01:15:23,626
Teng Chung-hsia, Fang Ho!

834
01:15:25,251 --> 01:15:26,709
Go, Fang Ho!

835
01:15:27,751 --> 01:15:29,459
1...2...3...

836
01:15:30,667 --> 01:15:34,167
1...2...3...

837
01:15:36,084 --> 01:15:39,751
Quiet...

838
01:15:39,917 --> 01:15:42,542
You should be fighting Japanese in Shantung

839
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:45,959
instead of guarding a traitor's house.

840
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:50,001
Comrades! Brothers...

841
01:15:50,459 --> 01:15:51,501
We're one family!

842
01:15:52,292 --> 01:15:54,292
I believe we're one family,

843
01:15:55,042 --> 01:15:58,292
Those you're holding off

844
01:15:58,626 --> 01:16:01,334
are your brothers and sisters.

845
01:16:01,626 --> 01:16:04,626
Each and every one a patriotic student.

846
01:16:04,792 --> 01:16:07,834
Move aside, let us through!

847
01:16:08,001 --> 01:16:11,667
Protect our territory!

848
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:14,459
Protect our sovereignty!

849
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:16,542
Brothers!

850
01:16:16,709 --> 01:16:19,751
Everyone of you is patriotic

851
01:16:20,001 --> 01:16:20,667
Am I right?

852
01:16:20,834 --> 01:16:21,667
Yes!

853
01:16:22,792 --> 01:16:24,542
Are you Chinese?

854
01:16:24,709 --> 01:16:25,501
Yes!

855
01:16:25,709 --> 01:16:27,501
Then let us through!

856
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:30,334
Charge!

857
01:16:31,834 --> 01:16:32,667
Students!

858
01:16:32,834 --> 01:16:33,709
Tell me where he is!

859
01:16:33,876 --> 01:16:36,292
Hand over the traitor!

860
01:16:36,459 --> 01:16:38,501
Search the house! Step aside...

861
01:16:38,667 --> 01:16:41,417
Students...

862
01:16:41,959 --> 01:16:43,792
Listen, harbouring traitors

863
01:16:43,959 --> 01:16:45,834
makes you also a traitor of China.

864
01:16:46,834 --> 01:16:47,667
He's here!

865
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:51,042
Students!

866
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:53,959
I have nothing to do with it!

867
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:55,084
Where is Chang Tsung-hsiang?

868
01:16:55,251 --> 01:16:56,126
I don't know!

869
01:16:56,292 --> 01:16:57,126
Take him away!

870
01:17:00,834 --> 01:17:01,626
Listen...

871
01:17:01,792 --> 01:17:03,709
This is the desk on which the treaty was signed!

872
01:17:04,001 --> 01:17:12,501
Burn it...

873
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:13,876
The police are here!

874
01:17:29,751 --> 01:17:31,292
Are you Ts'ao Ju-lin?

875
01:17:31,459 --> 01:17:32,751
No, I am not...

876
01:17:32,917 --> 01:17:34,376
- No? Then who are you? - I'm really nobody,

877
01:17:34,542 --> 01:17:36,792
just a visiting guest.

878
01:17:39,751 --> 01:17:41,334
Where did they go?

879
01:17:41,501 --> 01:17:42,167
They left.

880
01:17:42,334 --> 01:17:44,626
How could you! That's Chang Tsung-hsiang!

881
01:17:44,792 --> 01:17:45,584
After him...

882
01:18:19,542 --> 01:18:20,501
Let me go!

883
01:18:24,501 --> 01:18:26,792
Let me go!

884
01:18:27,501 --> 01:18:28,709
Let me go!

885
01:19:00,167 --> 01:19:02,376
Consider China's 2,000-year-old history,

886
01:19:02,792 --> 01:19:04,126
have you ever heard of

887
01:19:04,501 --> 01:19:06,876
students involved in arson and killing?

888
01:19:07,251 --> 01:19:09,459
They have no choice but to revolt.

889
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:11,376
Today...

890
01:19:11,626 --> 01:19:15,376
President Hsu has arrested innocent students.

891
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:18,917
He did it to please our enemies.

892
01:19:19,376 --> 01:19:21,292
As a staff member of the school,

893
01:19:21,292 --> 01:19:23,501
I declare the school will go on strike

894
01:19:23,501 --> 01:19:26,292
until the students are released.

895
01:19:26,459 --> 01:19:29,376
Long live students...

896
01:19:29,501 --> 01:19:32,792
Long live revolution...

897
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:55,709
What is it?

898
01:19:57,751 --> 01:20:00,501
You wrote "The Spirit of the Chinese People"

899
01:20:00,667 --> 01:20:02,376
and I admired you for it.

900
01:20:04,459 --> 01:20:05,501
Speaking of principles,

901
01:20:05,501 --> 01:20:08,417
you should know our differences with foreigners.

902
01:20:09,917 --> 01:20:11,001
But today,

903
01:20:11,417 --> 01:20:13,209
you wrote in a Japanese-owned newspaper

904
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:16,542
denouncing the students as barbaric mobsters!

905
01:20:18,042 --> 01:20:20,084
What has happened to your principles?

906
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:24,251
You're siding with the enemy.

907
01:20:44,459 --> 01:20:48,501
Students, workers and merchants are all on strike.

908
01:20:48,834 --> 01:20:52,834
Overnight, the whole country is in uproar.

909
01:20:54,459 --> 01:20:56,959
Even soldiers are siding with the students.

910
01:20:57,126 --> 01:21:00,417
This is a crucial moment, no compromise!

911
01:21:00,584 --> 01:21:03,959
We mustn't go against the tide.

912
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:04,959
Tu-hsiu, what is it?

913
01:22:06,584 --> 01:22:07,959
Have we won already?

914
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:10,251
Is this time for celebration?

915
01:22:11,084 --> 01:22:12,167
Ridiculous!

916
01:22:46,459 --> 01:22:47,501
Mr. Hu,

917
01:22:48,126 --> 01:22:52,084
are you denouncing Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Li Ta-Chao?

918
01:22:57,376 --> 01:22:58,792
Why not?

919
01:22:59,626 --> 01:23:01,042
You must have a sound argument.

920
01:23:01,709 --> 01:23:05,792
Marx's doctrine is just a theory.

921
01:23:06,292 --> 01:23:07,542
But such a theory

922
01:23:07,626 --> 01:23:10,792
though proven successful in Russia

923
01:23:11,042 --> 01:23:14,251
does not mean it's applicable in China.

924
01:23:15,334 --> 01:23:18,084
We must not act like a parrot

925
01:23:18,251 --> 01:23:20,876
and lose ourselves by following others.

926
01:23:21,042 --> 01:23:22,626
To sit back and talk about theories

927
01:23:23,334 --> 01:23:25,501
without solving the actual problems

928
01:23:26,667 --> 01:23:28,376
is no different from Confucianism.

929
01:23:28,542 --> 01:23:31,459
If this is what New Culture is about,

930
01:23:31,834 --> 01:23:33,417
then it's meaningless.

931
01:23:34,084 --> 01:23:37,834
For Ch'en and Li to model on Russia,

932
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:42,417
it's not going to solve our problems.

933
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:44,292
You're wrong, sir.

934
01:23:44,626 --> 01:23:46,917
Confucianism is a feudal code,

935
01:23:47,209 --> 01:23:49,084
Whereas Marx's doctrine is scientific.

936
01:23:49,251 --> 01:23:50,959
You can't compare the two.

937
01:24:11,834 --> 01:24:13,209
Esteemed delegates,

938
01:24:14,459 --> 01:24:19,917
what right do you have to give Shantung to Japan?

939
01:24:20,501 --> 01:24:22,042
I am furious.

940
01:24:22,959 --> 01:24:30,834
Chinese people will never forget this painful day.

941
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:40,251
You wouldn't dare to kill Ch'en Tu-hsiu!

942
01:24:40,834 --> 01:24:43,251
If he dies, there'll be hundreds more like him.

943
01:24:43,501 --> 01:24:46,334
Tell Hsu not to make himself a public enemy.

944
01:24:46,501 --> 01:24:48,584
If he still wants to continue as President,

945
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:50,126
he must release Ch'en Tu-hsiu at once.

946
01:25:14,459 --> 01:25:17,251
You have suffered, Tu-hsiu.

947
01:25:24,459 --> 01:25:28,042
Ch'en Tu-hsiu takes on the burden alone,

948
01:25:28,792 --> 01:25:30,626
and sets an example for us all.

949
01:25:32,251 --> 01:25:36,042
Peking University is proud of him.

950
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:40,584
Bravo, Mr. Ch'en!

951
01:26:03,126 --> 01:26:04,417
So sorry...

952
01:26:04,584 --> 01:26:06,459
- Over here! - What took you so long?

953
01:26:06,626 --> 01:26:07,959
We got lost!

954
01:26:09,751 --> 01:26:11,126
- Hello! - We'll do the introductions later,

955
01:26:11,292 --> 01:26:12,167
let's get on board.

956
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:13,542
Come on...

957
01:26:14,001 --> 01:26:14,626
Let's go!

958
01:26:14,917 --> 01:26:15,917
Wait...

959
01:26:17,626 --> 01:26:18,501
I'm thinking...

960
01:26:18,917 --> 01:26:20,792
transplanting the experience of
a foreign revolution

961
01:26:21,417 --> 01:26:22,584
does it really work?

962
01:26:22,792 --> 01:26:23,709
Changed your mind again?

963
01:26:23,876 --> 01:26:26,084
China has much more complex issues,

964
01:26:26,792 --> 01:26:28,084
I'd better stay.

965
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:31,167
Good luck all... Till we meet again.

966
01:26:37,709 --> 01:26:38,751
Give me some money!

967
01:26:48,292 --> 01:26:49,209
Who is he?

968
01:26:51,876 --> 01:26:53,084
Mao Tse-tung from Hu'nan.

969
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:55,376
What a shame he's not going!

970
01:27:05,584 --> 01:27:08,459
Why did the Governor shut down the
"Shian Kian Review"?

971
01:27:09,084 --> 01:27:10,542
Because we told the truth.

972
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:14,751
He's afraid the truth will come out

973
01:27:15,459 --> 01:27:17,792
about Chang Ching-yao being Hu'nan's public enemy.

974
01:27:18,459 --> 01:27:22,042
Workers, peasants and merchants have all suffered.

975
01:27:22,417 --> 01:27:25,459
Fellow workers, Hu'nan will not tolerate Chang!

976
01:27:25,709 --> 01:27:28,501
Hu'nan is finished with him around.

977
01:27:29,667 --> 01:27:32,626
We're only poor workers

978
01:27:32,792 --> 01:27:34,334
we have no say.

979
01:27:34,876 --> 01:27:36,209
How do you write the word "work"?

980
01:27:37,042 --> 01:27:38,917
A vertical stroke between 2 lines.

981
01:27:39,626 --> 01:27:43,084
Yes, heaven above your head
with your feet on the ground.

982
01:27:43,917 --> 01:27:45,542
The words "work" and "man" together

983
01:27:45,959 --> 01:27:47,834
make the word "heaven",

984
01:27:48,417 --> 01:27:51,001
It means the world under heaven.

985
01:27:51,667 --> 01:27:54,917
Workers and peasants will rule the world.

986
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:58,584
Sounds too good to be true.

987
01:28:00,209 --> 01:28:01,542
This is not my idea,

988
01:28:02,084 --> 01:28:03,959
it belongs to a foreigner called Marx.

989
01:28:04,501 --> 01:28:06,042
This foreigner advocated

990
01:28:06,417 --> 01:28:10,001
equality of all men.

991
01:28:10,667 --> 01:28:12,084
Adopting this theory,

992
01:28:12,209 --> 01:28:15,542
the Russian workers now rule their own country.

993
01:28:15,959 --> 01:28:21,334
Fellow workers, the revolution Marx spoke
of will be universal.

994
01:28:21,751 --> 01:28:26,167
Chinese workers should follow suit.

995
01:28:26,709 --> 01:28:31,001
Overthrow this corrupt and evil government

996
01:28:31,334 --> 01:28:35,292
that bullied and oppressed us.

997
01:28:35,542 --> 01:28:40,501
Yes...

998
01:28:48,584 --> 01:28:51,084
Tse-tung, your telegram.

999
01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:00,917
Tse-tung...

1000
01:29:05,667 --> 01:29:07,709
the doctor said dad had a stroke,

1001
01:29:08,167 --> 01:29:11,001
he can't talk, he can't hear.

1002
01:29:16,709 --> 01:29:21,626
His health has deteriorated so much in a year...

1003
01:29:23,042 --> 01:29:27,209
Before taken ill,
dad hadn't stopped speaking of you.

1004
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:33,792
Remember...

1005
01:29:34,876 --> 01:29:36,417
the summer of 1915

1006
01:29:36,667 --> 01:29:38,459
you asked me a question?

1007
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:40,459
All these years,

1008
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:44,459
I've been thinking hard.

1009
01:29:46,209 --> 01:29:47,751
I'm close to having an answer.

1010
01:29:51,626 --> 01:29:52,959
But...

1011
01:30:01,626 --> 01:30:02,459
Sir...

1012
01:30:02,626 --> 01:30:03,542
Dad...

1013
01:30:27,167 --> 01:30:28,542
As my wife,

1014
01:30:29,834 --> 01:30:31,126
life will be tough.

1015
01:30:35,834 --> 01:30:36,917
If you're with me,

1016
01:30:38,209 --> 01:30:40,251
you won't enjoy a stable life,

1017
01:30:41,459 --> 01:30:45,376
no bridal gowns, sedan chair or banquet.

1018
01:30:52,376 --> 01:30:54,376
Not even a witness or marriage license.

1019
01:31:16,251 --> 01:31:17,792
I'm willing.

1020
01:31:26,834 --> 01:31:30,251
The Governor wishes to meet your representatives.

1021
01:31:30,459 --> 01:31:31,584
Follow me!

1022
01:31:43,959 --> 01:31:44,501
Let them go!

1023
01:31:44,667 --> 01:31:46,792
You have no right to arrest us!

1024
01:31:46,959 --> 01:31:48,584
What are you doing? Let go!

1025
01:31:48,917 --> 01:31:49,792
What do you want?

1026
01:31:49,959 --> 01:31:53,792
Let go of me!

1027
01:31:58,584 --> 01:32:00,792
Let us out!

1028
01:32:09,792 --> 01:32:11,084
In this world,

1029
01:32:11,584 --> 01:32:13,542
who are the noblest people?

1030
01:32:14,834 --> 01:32:16,084
My answer to that...

1031
01:32:18,376 --> 01:32:20,167
is the working class.

1032
01:32:22,376 --> 01:32:26,626
Food, clothes, and even houses that we live in

1033
01:32:26,792 --> 01:32:29,792
are all created by workers.

1034
01:32:30,459 --> 01:32:32,251
We slave for a living,

1035
01:32:32,751 --> 01:32:35,959
but we're not well fed, clothed or sheltered.

1036
01:32:36,501 --> 01:32:37,876
Is that fair?

1037
01:32:38,042 --> 01:32:39,126
No!

1038
01:32:39,334 --> 01:32:41,667
Of course not!

1039
01:32:42,292 --> 01:32:44,959
That's why we must unite

1040
01:32:45,167 --> 01:32:46,417
and go on strike.

1041
01:32:47,167 --> 01:32:49,084
Confront these bourgeois factory owners

1042
01:32:49,334 --> 01:32:50,751
and show them our strength.

1043
01:32:50,917 --> 01:32:52,876
Reclaim what is rightfully ours.

1044
01:32:54,459 --> 01:32:55,584
Fellow workers,

1045
01:32:56,334 --> 01:32:59,459
in the future

1046
01:32:59,709 --> 01:33:02,001
workers will rule the world.

1047
01:33:03,042 --> 01:33:10,459
Long live workers!

1048
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:15,251
Release the students!

1049
01:33:15,751 --> 01:33:18,459
Sir, these students haven't eaten in 3 days.

1050
01:33:19,042 --> 01:33:20,084
Who's not eating?

1051
01:33:21,126 --> 01:33:22,292
Let him starve to death!

1052
01:33:22,834 --> 01:33:24,959
He has no one but himself to blame.

1053
01:33:41,834 --> 01:33:43,417
Who wrote this?

1054
01:33:44,876 --> 01:33:46,084
I did.

1055
01:33:48,834 --> 01:33:50,251
These are our latest demands.

1056
01:33:53,917 --> 01:33:57,251
The hunger strike continues until they are met.

1057
01:34:02,876 --> 01:34:05,626
We want books and newspapers.

1058
01:34:05,959 --> 01:34:07,376
- Go ahead. - Yes!

1059
01:34:08,751 --> 01:34:09,917
We want New Year dinner.

1060
01:34:10,084 --> 01:34:14,626
I'll treat all 26 of you to dinner!

1061
01:34:15,209 --> 01:34:16,376
We'll even eat outside.

1062
01:34:16,542 --> 01:34:18,209
The Awakening Society needs a place to study.

1063
01:34:19,251 --> 01:34:20,292
Certainly.

1064
01:34:22,167 --> 01:34:23,209
What's your name?

1065
01:34:26,417 --> 01:34:27,417
Chou En-lai.

1066
01:34:37,876 --> 01:34:39,042
Why did you change your mind?

1067
01:34:39,459 --> 01:34:41,042
Didn't we agree to go on hunger strike?

1068
01:34:41,209 --> 01:34:44,542
Change of tactics.
Let's prepare for a long struggle!

1069
01:34:44,959 --> 01:34:45,917
Let's eat.

1070
01:35:23,459 --> 01:35:24,501
Goodbye!

1071
01:35:26,167 --> 01:35:26,917
Mr. Ch'en!

1072
01:35:30,292 --> 01:35:32,792
"Cops are after you, follow the student, Li Ta-Chao"

1073
01:35:33,209 --> 01:35:34,251
Follow me!

1074
01:35:42,251 --> 01:35:44,792
If you leave Peking while on bail

1075
01:35:45,376 --> 01:35:47,209
and get arrested again,

1076
01:35:47,376 --> 01:35:48,376
it'll be difficult to get out.

1077
01:35:48,542 --> 01:35:50,042
I'll go back to Shanghai.

1078
01:35:54,626 --> 01:35:56,542
Scholars-in-arms are hopeless.

1079
01:35:58,084 --> 01:35:59,376
Don't say that!

1080
01:36:00,667 --> 01:36:03,376
Your arrest has shaken the nation.

1081
01:36:03,667 --> 01:36:05,792
That's as big an honour as you can get!

1082
01:36:10,376 --> 01:36:12,001
What are you studying these days?

1083
01:36:13,876 --> 01:36:15,001
The Russian Revolution.

1084
01:36:20,834 --> 01:36:22,667
Hu Shih was right about you!

1085
01:36:23,667 --> 01:36:27,042
The Russian Revolution is all you care about.

1086
01:36:28,084 --> 01:36:32,417
It's the last resort when all else have failed.

1087
01:36:34,709 --> 01:36:35,667
Now tell me,

1088
01:36:37,709 --> 01:36:40,417
why model after Russia?

1089
01:36:40,709 --> 01:36:43,292
The reason why the Russians succeeded

1090
01:36:43,751 --> 01:36:45,834
was because the Bolsheviks

1091
01:36:46,001 --> 01:36:49,042
united the workers and peasants,

1092
01:36:49,209 --> 01:36:51,459
the broadest social classes.

1093
01:36:52,709 --> 01:36:55,876
To unite the nation, you must first

1094
01:36:56,584 --> 01:36:58,209
unite peasants and workers.

1095
01:36:58,626 --> 01:36:59,751
To unite them,

1096
01:37:00,584 --> 01:37:03,292
China must first have its own Bolshevik.

1097
01:37:05,626 --> 01:37:07,959
Tu-hsiu, when you get to Shanghai,

1098
01:37:08,126 --> 01:37:09,667
that's exactly what you've to do.

1099
01:37:09,917 --> 01:37:13,209
We'll split up, you take the north, I go south,

1100
01:37:13,376 --> 01:37:15,042
form our own political party at once.

1101
01:37:24,459 --> 01:37:25,417
Easy...

1102
01:37:27,292 --> 01:37:28,334
When I get to Shanghai,

1103
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:30,584
I'll send you your favourite candy.

1104
01:37:30,917 --> 01:37:32,292
You must keep your word!

1105
01:37:36,251 --> 01:37:37,084
Take care!

1106
01:37:38,084 --> 01:37:39,084
Take care!

1107
01:38:18,959 --> 01:38:20,667
We should help China

1108
01:38:20,834 --> 01:38:23,667
build her own Bolshevik Party.

1109
01:38:23,834 --> 01:38:27,251
The committee nominates Maring to assist.

1110
01:38:28,001 --> 01:38:30,667
Excellent, go right away!

1111
01:38:32,459 --> 01:38:34,001
Bravo!

1112
01:38:41,084 --> 01:38:42,542
What does the Shanghai dispatch say?

1113
01:38:44,542 --> 01:38:46,667
Each region should send two delegates
to the congress,

1114
01:38:46,834 --> 01:38:48,626
and the Caucuses in Japan and Europe

1115
01:38:48,792 --> 01:38:50,167
will each send one delegate.

1116
01:38:50,167 --> 01:38:51,334
Peking, Shanghai, Canton,

1117
01:38:51,542 --> 01:38:53,709
Ch'ang-she, Wuhan and Tsinan
will all be represented.

1118
01:38:54,042 --> 01:38:56,167
You and Ch'en Kung-po will represent Canton.

1119
01:38:57,167 --> 01:39:00,167
You two will represent Peking.

1120
01:39:01,001 --> 01:39:01,792
Remember,

1121
01:39:01,959 --> 01:39:04,292
you're there as my personal representative.

1122
01:39:04,667 --> 01:39:05,626
Aren't you attending?

1123
01:39:06,251 --> 01:39:08,376
The Comintern is attaching great importance to it.

1124
01:39:08,667 --> 01:39:11,376
If neither you nor Mr. Ch'en attend,

1125
01:39:11,542 --> 01:39:13,042
what's the point of having the congress?

1126
01:39:14,709 --> 01:39:16,417
Apologise to Comrade Maring for me.

1127
01:39:18,459 --> 01:39:22,042
Students are borrowing more books
for summer vacation.

1128
01:39:22,501 --> 01:39:23,876
I can't leave as Head Librarian.

1129
01:39:24,251 --> 01:39:27,042
I disagree with the Comintern on many issues,

1130
01:39:27,584 --> 01:39:29,834
if we argue during the congress

1131
01:39:30,167 --> 01:39:31,834
there will be no way back.

1132
01:39:32,001 --> 01:39:32,584
I see.

1133
01:39:32,751 --> 01:39:33,667
Remember,

1134
01:39:34,709 --> 01:39:37,876
Ch'en Tu-hsiu and I must act in unanimity.

1135
01:39:38,167 --> 01:39:39,042
I understand.

1136
01:39:56,584 --> 01:39:58,917
This should be enough for a month,

1137
01:40:00,834 --> 01:40:03,501
when you get to Shanghai, spend when you have to.

1138
01:40:06,584 --> 01:40:08,084
Dad left this,

1139
01:40:10,751 --> 01:40:11,876
you have it.

1140
01:40:14,459 --> 01:40:15,542
No, you keep it.

1141
01:40:16,792 --> 01:40:19,417
Don't be late for the congress.

1142
01:40:20,917 --> 01:40:21,834
No!

1143
01:40:22,417 --> 01:40:26,001
Just take it.

1144
01:40:45,292 --> 01:40:46,334
I'm leaving,

1145
01:40:49,709 --> 01:40:51,209
take good care of yourself.

1146
01:41:21,751 --> 01:41:23,459
Let me introduce myself,

1147
01:41:23,917 --> 01:41:25,501
Chang Kuo-t'ao from Peking.

1148
01:41:26,626 --> 01:41:28,501
Liu Jen-ching, also from Peking.

1149
01:41:28,667 --> 01:41:31,126
I'm Li Han-Chun from Shanghai.

1150
01:41:31,626 --> 01:41:33,001
Li Ta from Shanghai.

1151
01:41:33,167 --> 01:41:35,001
Teng En-ming from Tsinan.

1152
01:41:35,501 --> 01:41:37,209
Wang Chin-mei from Tsinan.

1153
01:41:37,876 --> 01:41:39,167
Tung Pi-Wu from Wuhan.

1154
01:41:39,876 --> 01:41:41,334
Ch'en Tan-ch'iu from Wuhan.

1155
01:41:42,167 --> 01:41:43,917
Chou Fo-hai from Japan.

1156
01:41:45,334 --> 01:41:48,709
Pao Hui-Seng, representing Ch'en Tu-hsiu.
Nice to meet you.

1157
01:41:48,834 --> 01:41:50,834
Ho Shu-heng from Chang-sha.

1158
01:41:51,251 --> 01:41:54,376
- This comrade from Chang-sha is...
- Tse-tung,

1159
01:41:55,292 --> 01:41:56,042
it's been a while.

1160
01:41:56,209 --> 01:41:57,334
Indeed, Kuo-t'ao.

1161
01:41:58,709 --> 01:42:00,209
My apologies, gentlemen...

1162
01:42:00,376 --> 01:42:02,209
Sorry for being late.

1163
01:42:02,834 --> 01:42:04,792
Hello, everyone.

1164
01:42:05,542 --> 01:42:07,834
I'm Ch'en Kung-po from Canton.

1165
01:42:08,209 --> 01:42:11,292
Who's the lovely lady?

1166
01:42:11,501 --> 01:42:12,084
My wife.

1167
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:14,084
Greetings, I'm Li Li-Chuang.

1168
01:42:14,251 --> 01:42:16,542
But we can't accommodate a couple...

1169
01:42:16,751 --> 01:42:17,167
I'm sorry...

1170
01:42:17,334 --> 01:42:19,376
We've a room at Tatung Hotel across the street.

1171
01:42:19,542 --> 01:42:20,709
Bringing your spouse to the congress?

1172
01:42:22,126 --> 01:42:23,042
Everyone...

1173
01:42:23,209 --> 01:42:24,876
This is my wife, Wang Hui-w...

1174
01:42:25,501 --> 01:42:27,376
I'm working the reception.

1175
01:42:27,542 --> 01:42:29,042
Look for me if you need anything.

1176
01:42:29,876 --> 01:42:32,584
We've all had long trips, get some rest.

1177
01:42:32,876 --> 01:42:34,251
Meet at my brother's place tomorrow.

1178
01:42:34,417 --> 01:42:37,001
106 rue Wantz.

1179
01:42:38,001 --> 01:42:38,959
I'm most honoured

1180
01:42:39,167 --> 01:42:41,834
to represent Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Li Ta-Chao

1181
01:42:42,001 --> 01:42:44,792
to chair the First National Congress.

1182
01:42:44,959 --> 01:42:45,917
Let me introduce to you

1183
01:42:46,834 --> 01:42:47,792
Comrade Maring,

1184
01:42:47,917 --> 01:42:50,376
an observer from Comintern.

1185
01:42:50,834 --> 01:42:52,751
Mao Tse-tung will be our secretary.

1186
01:42:55,209 --> 01:42:58,084
The first item on the agenda

1187
01:42:58,501 --> 01:42:59,667
is to decide on the name of the party.

1188
01:43:00,251 --> 01:43:04,376
Our view regarding the name of the party
is clear-cut.

1189
01:43:04,917 --> 01:43:07,084
From the "The Communist Manifesto",

1190
01:43:07,251 --> 01:43:09,001
we adopt the word "Communist"

1191
01:43:09,376 --> 01:43:11,501
and call it the Chinese Communist Party.

1192
01:43:12,084 --> 01:43:15,417
In his letter to Tse-tung,
Ts'ai Ho-san is also in favour.

1193
01:43:21,584 --> 01:43:25,667
Maring wants to know Li Ta-chao's view.

1194
01:43:31,667 --> 01:43:33,292
Mr. Li's preference is

1195
01:43:34,251 --> 01:43:35,251
Chinese Communist Party.

1196
01:43:35,251 --> 01:43:36,126
I agree.

1197
01:43:36,459 --> 01:43:37,709
Agreed.

1198
01:43:39,459 --> 01:43:44,209
Agreed.

1199
01:43:46,126 --> 01:43:47,209
Unanimously passed.

1200
01:44:04,584 --> 01:44:05,292
Rickshaw-man,

1201
01:44:06,376 --> 01:44:08,292
Tung Fang Hotel on Nanking Road.

1202
01:44:08,459 --> 01:44:10,667
Let's go to Palace Hotel instead.

1203
01:44:10,876 --> 01:44:12,667
We're switching hotels?

1204
01:44:12,834 --> 01:44:14,042
We're being followed.

1205
01:44:14,459 --> 01:44:16,042
Be careful, don't look around.

1206
01:44:16,501 --> 01:44:17,667
Palace Hotel.

1207
01:44:17,959 --> 01:44:18,792
Got it!

1208
01:44:42,459 --> 01:44:44,876
Is there another exit?

1209
01:44:45,084 --> 01:44:47,959
There's a back entrance for the staff.

1210
01:44:48,167 --> 01:44:50,167
Wait for us there in five minutes.

1211
01:44:50,334 --> 01:44:51,376
Sure!

1212
01:44:57,417 --> 01:45:02,584
Why are we being followed everywhere?

1213
01:45:02,751 --> 01:45:03,751
I'm sorry, sir.

1214
01:45:04,209 --> 01:45:05,834
The first floor is full,

1215
01:45:06,126 --> 01:45:07,251
is the second floor alright?

1216
01:45:08,542 --> 01:45:09,501
Alright!

1217
01:45:23,751 --> 01:45:24,584
Jump!

1218
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:41,876
Stupid idiots...

1219
01:45:46,917 --> 01:45:47,709
Go look for them!

1220
01:45:47,876 --> 01:45:50,209
Find them in three days or else!

1221
01:45:50,376 --> 01:45:53,501
Sir, my brother is with the Green Gang

1222
01:45:53,834 --> 01:45:56,542
finding someone in Shanghai is a piece of cake.

1223
01:46:00,251 --> 01:46:03,334
The Peking caucus has 13 members,

1224
01:46:03,542 --> 01:46:06,501
including Li Ta-Chao, Chang Kuo-t'ao,

1225
01:46:06,709 --> 01:46:08,584
Lo Zhang-lung, Liu Jen-ch'ing,

1226
01:46:08,792 --> 01:46:11,459
Ch'en Te-jung, Teng Chung-hsia,

1227
01:46:11,709 --> 01:46:15,626
Kao Chun-yu, Miu Po-ying, Ho Meng-hsiung,

1228
01:46:15,792 --> 01:46:18,459
Chu Wu-shan, Fan Hung-chieh, Wu Ju-ming.

1229
01:46:19,626 --> 01:46:21,126
Heads up, everyone!

1230
01:46:23,042 --> 01:46:24,167
is hereby pronounced
for delegates to comment and discuss.

1231
01:46:24,334 --> 01:46:27,501
is hereby pronounced
for delegates to comment and discuss.

1232
01:46:28,626 --> 01:46:31,167
Proletariat must join force
with the revolutionary army

1233
01:46:31,459 --> 01:46:33,626
and overthrow the bourgeois regime;

1234
01:46:33,876 --> 01:46:35,626
they must help the working class

1235
01:46:35,792 --> 01:46:38,459
until the class system is abolished,

1236
01:46:38,626 --> 01:46:40,667
and until the class struggle has ended.

1237
01:46:40,876 --> 01:46:44,334
Meaning, when class system is finally abolished,

1238
01:46:44,501 --> 01:46:46,251
a proletariat dictatorship will be established.

1239
01:46:46,876 --> 01:46:48,376
Liaise with the Comintern,

1240
01:46:48,626 --> 01:46:50,251
and adopt the Soviet model.

1241
01:46:50,417 --> 01:46:53,251
Unite workers, peasants and soldiers

1242
01:46:53,417 --> 01:46:57,001
and adopt social revolution as our goal.

1243
01:46:57,459 --> 01:46:59,542
Those who accept the Party's platform and policies,

1244
01:46:59,709 --> 01:47:01,542
and willing to be loyal members,

1245
01:47:01,709 --> 01:47:03,292
upon the introduction of a Party member,

1246
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:05,501
regardless of gender and nationality

1247
01:47:05,667 --> 01:47:07,292
can be admitted as Party members

1248
01:47:07,792 --> 01:47:08,959
and become our comrades.

1249
01:47:09,376 --> 01:47:11,084
But...

1250
01:47:11,792 --> 01:47:13,542
before their initiation into the Party,

1251
01:47:13,709 --> 01:47:15,334
they must sever all ties

1252
01:47:15,501 --> 01:47:17,251
with other parties and organisations

1253
01:47:17,417 --> 01:47:18,792
whose platforms are contradictory to ours.

1254
01:47:19,167 --> 01:47:20,667
Tomorrow is the last day of the congress,

1255
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:22,167
the main agenda

1256
01:47:22,334 --> 01:47:25,084
is to adopt the platform
and election of the Central Committee.

1257
01:47:25,251 --> 01:47:27,042
Comrades Maring and Nikolsky

1258
01:47:27,209 --> 01:47:29,001
will attend tomorrow's closing session.

1259
01:47:36,251 --> 01:47:37,126
Rickshaw!

1260
01:48:23,292 --> 01:48:27,042
Sorry, we had to make a detour.

1261
01:48:27,751 --> 01:48:28,584
Is everyone here?

1262
01:48:29,251 --> 01:48:31,126
Chou Fo-hai is in the toilet,

1263
01:48:31,292 --> 01:48:32,126
he'll be right back.

1264
01:48:32,542 --> 01:48:33,459
It's that Chou again!

1265
01:48:34,126 --> 01:48:34,917
Let's not wait.

1266
01:48:36,292 --> 01:48:37,626
The draft platform we tabled yesterday,

1267
01:48:38,084 --> 01:48:40,251
can continue to be discussed now.

1268
01:48:40,834 --> 01:48:41,584
I have a comment.

1269
01:48:42,292 --> 01:48:44,167
Regarding nationality...

1270
01:48:56,376 --> 01:48:57,126
Can I help you?

1271
01:48:57,792 --> 01:48:58,584
Looking for someone?

1272
01:48:58,959 --> 01:48:59,667
What do you want?

1273
01:49:02,042 --> 01:49:02,834
Who are you looking for?

1274
01:49:03,001 --> 01:49:04,376
Chairman Wang of the Social League.

1275
01:49:05,001 --> 01:49:06,417
There's no Social League

1276
01:49:06,584 --> 01:49:07,501
or Chairman Wang.

1277
01:49:13,792 --> 01:49:15,001
I'm sorry...

1278
01:49:25,459 --> 01:49:27,542
Maring calls for an immediate recess.

1279
01:49:29,167 --> 01:49:30,501
I agree with Comrade Maring.

1280
01:49:30,792 --> 01:49:31,834
Let's adjourne.

1281
01:49:48,209 --> 01:49:50,501
This is my home. What are you doing here?

1282
01:49:54,334 --> 01:49:56,792
Why do you organise meeting in your house?

1283
01:49:57,209 --> 01:50:01,126
What meeting? I was entertaining guests.

1284
01:50:01,292 --> 01:50:04,626
That two are from which country?

1285
01:50:04,792 --> 01:50:05,792
Which two?

1286
01:50:06,084 --> 01:50:07,751
The two foreigners.

1287
01:50:07,917 --> 01:50:10,001
They're Dutch.

1288
01:50:15,209 --> 01:50:17,251
Pack up and be ready to move out!

1289
01:50:28,209 --> 01:50:29,001
Sir.

1290
01:50:32,959 --> 01:50:34,501
What do you do for a living?

1291
01:50:35,626 --> 01:50:36,542
Professor.

1292
01:50:38,084 --> 01:50:39,001
Him?

1293
01:50:39,709 --> 01:50:40,751
My colleague.

1294
01:50:41,667 --> 01:50:46,042
Today I can close your house and catch your people.

1295
01:50:46,459 --> 01:50:49,959
Because you are teaching in university,
I'll let you free.

1296
01:50:51,167 --> 01:50:54,001
If not, you will burn yourself.

1297
01:50:55,001 --> 01:50:56,126
I won't.

1298
01:51:10,334 --> 01:51:11,126
How is it?

1299
01:51:12,292 --> 01:51:13,292
It's fine.

1300
01:51:13,584 --> 01:51:15,084
Comrade Maring said we must leave Shanghai.

1301
01:51:15,459 --> 01:51:16,792
I suggest we go to Chiahsing

1302
01:51:16,959 --> 01:51:19,251
rent a boat for the meeting.

1303
01:51:19,417 --> 01:51:21,084
Is Maring coming?

1304
01:51:21,251 --> 01:51:22,334
He's too obvious a target,

1305
01:51:22,501 --> 01:51:24,209
for our safety, he's not going.

1306
01:51:24,376 --> 01:51:25,167
Alright!

1307
01:51:25,667 --> 01:51:26,292
What time do we leave?

1308
01:51:26,417 --> 01:51:28,417
There's a train tomorrow at 10:00am.

1309
01:51:29,292 --> 01:51:31,126
Does Ch'en Kung-po know?

1310
01:51:31,292 --> 01:51:32,459
I'll go get him tomorrow morning.

1311
01:51:37,501 --> 01:51:41,542
Are you under surveillance?

1312
01:51:41,751 --> 01:51:43,626
Probably not, it was an accident.

1313
01:51:44,084 --> 01:51:45,126
Let's go home.

1314
01:51:45,917 --> 01:51:47,001
The meeting is not yet over.

1315
01:51:48,334 --> 01:51:51,584
To form a national party with just 50 people,

1316
01:51:51,751 --> 01:51:53,084
this has to be a joke!

1317
01:52:59,876 --> 01:53:00,876
A gun!

1318
01:53:10,959 --> 01:53:11,626
Don't stare!

1319
01:54:34,626 --> 01:54:36,001
Homicide at Tatung Hotel!

1320
01:54:36,626 --> 01:54:37,584
Tatung Hotel?

1321
01:54:39,876 --> 01:54:41,251
That's where Ch'en Kung-po stays!

1322
01:54:46,209 --> 01:54:48,626
Kung-po left for Kwangtung already.

1323
01:54:48,792 --> 01:54:50,292
Yesterday two people died at their hotel.

1324
01:54:50,501 --> 01:54:52,459
His wife was petrified. So they left.

1325
01:54:53,292 --> 01:54:54,751
It was a lovers' suicide pact!

1326
01:54:56,209 --> 01:54:57,251
Cowards!

1327
01:54:59,001 --> 01:54:59,834
Let's go.

1328
01:55:22,334 --> 01:55:25,376
Comrades, we have reached the critical hours.

1329
01:55:25,626 --> 01:55:27,001
The last item on the agenda,

1330
01:55:27,459 --> 01:55:29,001
is to elect the Party Central Committee.

1331
01:55:29,542 --> 01:55:30,667
Under democratic principles,

1332
01:55:30,959 --> 01:55:32,084
we shall vote for

1333
01:55:32,251 --> 01:55:34,667
members of the Central Committee.

1334
01:55:44,376 --> 01:55:45,792
We should have 13 delegates,

1335
01:55:45,959 --> 01:55:47,251
but only 12 are in attendance.

1336
01:55:48,376 --> 01:55:49,209
After the vote,

1337
01:55:49,459 --> 01:55:53,292
Ch'en Tu-hsiu, Chang Kuo-t'ao and Li Ta

1338
01:55:53,459 --> 01:55:55,292
are elected Central Committee members,

1339
01:55:55,584 --> 01:55:58,417
Ch'en Tu-hsiu is named General Secretary.

1340
01:55:58,876 --> 01:55:59,876
Meeting is concluded.

1341
01:56:00,876 --> 01:56:01,626
Comrades,

1342
01:56:02,042 --> 01:56:04,417
I'd like to recite from "The Communist Manifesto"

1343
01:56:04,667 --> 01:56:06,376
to illustrate my thrill and excitement.

1344
01:56:09,042 --> 01:56:12,209
The Communists disdain to conceal

1345
01:56:12,376 --> 01:56:14,834
their aims and views.

1346
01:56:15,376 --> 01:56:16,667
They openly declare

1347
01:56:17,042 --> 01:56:19,584
that their ends can be attained

1348
01:56:19,751 --> 01:56:22,001
only by the forcible overthrow

1349
01:56:22,167 --> 01:56:22,626
of all existing social conditions.

1350
01:56:22,792 --> 01:56:24,209
Let the ruling classes tremble

1351
01:56:24,376 --> 01:56:26,501
at a communist revolution.

1352
01:56:27,042 --> 01:56:30,334
The proletarians have nothing to lose
but their chains.

1353
01:56:30,792 --> 01:56:33,459
They have a world to win.

1354
01:56:33,751 --> 01:56:36,376
Proletarians of all countries, unite.

1355
01:56:37,042 --> 01:56:39,834
Proletarians of all countries, unite.

1356
01:56:40,001 --> 01:56:42,751
Proletarians of all countries, unite...

1357
01:56:43,126 --> 01:56:46,084
Proletarians of all countries...

1358
01:56:46,292 --> 01:56:47,334
...unite
