1
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:33,426
SUKCES

2
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,682
Good day.

3
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,227
-Your tickets, please.
-Here you go.

4
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:49,067
-How can l identify you?
-That's me.

5
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,610
Take it off.

6
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,322
Haven't you heard
about Chernobyl?

7
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,075
-Radioactivity.
-Take it off.

8
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,626
lt's you. Here is your lD
and your ticket.

9
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,753
-Good bye.
-Thanks.

10
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,933
There is a time in a man's life

11
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:26,062
when every woman calls you
''my angel'' and wants to give you

12
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,607
her breast to suck.
lt never repeats itself

13
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:34,404
and later it's hard to find
even one volunteer.

14
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:42,037
Here they are.
The ones and only.

15
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,248
Just as pals from the army.

16
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,044
Marek...

17
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,881
Marek Late. Just a second.

18
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,300
My father.

19
00:02:55,508 --> 00:03:00,138
Used to say l was a cute newborn
but they switched me in the ward.

20
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,559
l don't know if he was joking.

21
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:20,033
Things really started to happen
after l'd turned eight.

22
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,873
Wake up, sonny. Marek, wake up.

23
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,586
My mother. For her l was
the dearest

24
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:35,215
person on earth.
She let me believe

25
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:39,803
that for everything there was
a why and a wherefore.

26
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,889
That even an innocent event

27
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:46,893
could have irreversible
consequences.

28
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,407
Dear children,

29
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:06,496
let this holy water
remind you of your baptism.

30
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:13,086
Jesus will call upon you
to unite with Him.

31
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,296
This union

32
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,632
will occur fully

33
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,427
when for the first time, today

34
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,221
you'll receive
the Holy Communion.

35
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,184
-Do you renounce the evil spirit?
-Body of Christ.

36
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,173
Body of Christ.

37
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,355
Dear God! What about me?

38
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,485
But after all God
didn't forget about me.

39
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:24,282
And perhaps more out of pity
than real need he took interest

40
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,326
in my case.

41
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,578
Say cheese!

42
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,330
Hold on!

43
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,960
And the shoes.

44
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:51,393
From my childhood l remember
one day when l was going

45
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,687
home from school. l was ten.

46
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:58,733
For the first time l communicated
with my idol - God.

47
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,986
l'd never seen him,
but we had

48
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:07,409
good relations. But the Devil took
the shape of a small blonde.

49
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,964
Dear Lord...

50
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,302
That's me.

51
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,688
l've got a favour to ask.

52
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,529
Don't let them take me
to the blackboard.

53
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,826
Does it have to be now?
l'm talking to God.

54
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:56,082
-Which day of the month is it?
-The 23rd.

55
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:00,754
-Number 23.
-Please, God...

56
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,343
Marek Late,
come to the blackboard.

57
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,722
Tell me, please...

58
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,849
Tell me, please...

59
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,229
Why are you so scrawny?

60
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,114
So small? With such shiny eyes?

61
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,494
Cause right now
my mind is growing.

62
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,640
Dear God, you scared me.

63
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,685
l didn't pay attention.

64
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:01,606
-Why?
-Do you know what a woman is?

65
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:24,921
They were somehow wiser.
l wanted to be like them. And what?

66
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,049
A mistake.

67
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,782
The task has been accomplished.

68
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:58,621
We gathered... 30 kg
of waste paper.

69
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,543
Super! At the next meeting
you'll receive ''gatherer'' badges.

70
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,086
That's all.

71
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,428
-Can l do it next week?
-We're finished with this project.

72
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,057
But you can take
it to the purchasing centre

73
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,727
and get the ''thrifty'' badge.

74
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,730
What was l to do?

75
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:28,318
ln the paper mill where my father
worked they were short of paper.

76
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,446
l was pissed.

77
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:36,534
l'd always been the king of waste
paper, and now such a screwup.

78
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:49,089
But as it turned out it was all
a part of a Divine Plan.

79
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:54,177
My God came up with it for me.
Especially for me.

80
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:58,431
l didn't get the badge
and was thrown out of the scouts

81
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,937
for stealing books about Vinnetou,
but l had a new friend.

82
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,774
That was all that counted.

83
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,492
Carry them always on you.

84
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,333
Chief...

85
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,132
What is the most important
thing in life?

86
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,261
To be a chief.

87
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,019
What do you mean? Tell me!

88
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,855
What?!

89
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:03,496
Be a chief! Easy to say.

90
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:09,627
Be like Vinnetou, like famous
athlete, astronaut, boxer or pope.

91
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,255
Universe, Vatican...
Everything is taken.

92
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:16,384
They've been there, done that.
Weighted all, measured all.

93
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,678
And what of me?

94
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,269
Now what?

95
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,065
Come on.

96
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,768
l'd hoped that when l grew up
l'd better express my dreams.

97
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,312
''A ''.

98
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:10,897
''G''.

99
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,148
''Z''.

100
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,194
''B''.

101
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,029
''Z''.

102
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,281
''U''.

103
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,510
Skinny legs, pimples,
hair in strange places

104
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:45,056
and this part till now used only
for pissing, which'd taken

105
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,933
a new personality.

106
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:52,063
l spent long hours in the john,
urging him to fly.

107
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,441
l was flying...

108
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,862
We were flying together,
he was ahead, l followed.

109
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,898
Maciek... Wait up.

110
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,194
My soul hurts. l'm suffering.

111
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,237
Suffering.

112
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,493
Do you think about
who you want to become?

113
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,078
No.

114
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,711
-Where are you running to?
-Around.

115
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,805
l realised then

116
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:11,559
how difficult it was to find two
people thinking in the same way.

117
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,687
Help me.

118
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:19,984
How can l fulfil my ambitions?
l need something that will guide me.

119
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:24,656
-Here you go.
-Great. What am l to do with it?

120
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,660
You shoot, God carries the arrows.

121
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,924
O, my God!

122
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,532
Where's my armband?

123
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:11,828
l didn't want to go to school.
l didn't want to think.

124
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,539
-Move aside.
-l'm on strike.

125
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,250
-You're too young.
-Not at all.

126
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:33,808
What's the matter? Every year
you go to summer camp.

127
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:38,229
And away for the winter break.
Almost for free.

128
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,607
Let him rebel.

129
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,860
Medical care and vacations
almost for free.

130
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:47,489
You can study all you want,
provided you're gifted.

131
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,534
You can become an engineer,
What more do you want?

132
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:57,290
-Oranges.
-They are on their way from Cuba.

133
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,293
-Where is my fucking armband?
-Here.

134
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:05,423
Give it to me. l'm gonna go
and fight for your oranges.

135
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:14,015
l rebelled against my father,
he against the authorities.

136
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,686
He seemed such a great leader
that l had to follow him.

137
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,488
l'll never forget it.

138
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,158
A giant machine stops.

139
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,664
There is silence.

140
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:23,293
Father was sent to an internment
camp. Mother often visited him.

141
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,839
There was a crisis.
Meat was rationed,

142
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:32,093
and we were always hungry.
We needed meat.

143
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:36,222
l felt that something
was blocking me.

144
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,476
That something was deterring
my development.

145
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,936
Was coercing me.

146
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,231
Wrong word.
Was cramping my style.

147
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,818
That's right.
And then something happen.

148
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,405
Really something.

149
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,551
Alone! Ah, men!

150
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:17,889
And who of you,
divining my spirit,

151
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:21,267
grasps the meaning of its song?

152
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:25,397
Whose eye will see the radiance
of its shining?

153
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:31,236
Alas, who toils to sing
for men, toils long!

154
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,169
Shut the fuck up!

155
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,796
You...

156
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,132
savages!

157
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,342
You chickenshits!

158
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:00,807
You motherfuckers full of stink!

159
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,309
Shut the fuck up!

160
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,104
And that's that!

161
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,277
All of you! Stand up!

162
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,082
Give me

163
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:33,214
the rule of souls!
This lifless building

164
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:37,719
that common people call the world,
and praise,

165
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:42,307
l so despise that l have
never tested whether my word

166
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:47,562
has not the power to raze
and ruin it. But well l know

167
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:53,777
if through the portal
of air l swiftly shot my will

168
00:19:55,028 --> 00:20:00,825
l might put out a hundred stars
and light a hundred still,

169
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:04,954
for l am immortal!

170
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,638
Chief!

171
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,431
Chief!

172
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,814
Where are you!

173
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,025
-What's your problem?
-l'm looking for Vinnetou.

174
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:38,571
-That's me.
-Give me the rule of souls...

175
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,991
-What?
-l want to be an actor.

176
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:57,674
The amount of radiation poses
no real health threat.

177
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,224
Yes. lt was the big explosion
at Chernobyl.

178
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:11,229
And that man caused a great
eruption of dreams in my brain.

179
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:17,277
Oh, the great year 1 986.
The year of the big explosion.

180
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:21,239
At last l knew
what it meant to be a chief.

181
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,752
l took off to become a chief.

182
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,006
l left chaos behind. There was
a straight road in front of me.

183
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,883
l felt like a man.

184
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:44,763
lt's very manly to set a goal
and then to pursue it.

185
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,431
Thanks.

186
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:59,569
l'm travelling by train
for the first time.

187
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,656
l'm afraid too, chief.

188
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,420
l had a lot of experience,

189
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:19,547
l had a goal,

190
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,926
there was one straight road ahead.

191
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,179
One straight road.

192
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,849
One straight road.

193
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,608
Silence!

194
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,486
Please, be quiet!

195
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,117
Please, be quiet!
l want to welcome you

196
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:53,206
to our school. Tom Burzynski alias
Thunder. l'm studying directing.

197
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:59,879
l'm here to take care of you.
What's the name of this school?

198
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:04,968
lt's a drama school.
30 people for one place.

199
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:08,596
So be humble. Over there
you see a list. You go

200
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,266
in alphabetical order.
Prepare your lines.

201
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:16,896
Concentrate, take two deep breaths,
and go in. ls that clear?

202
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:20,316
-l can't here you!
-Yes!

203
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:21,860
Thanks.

204
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:43,173
What have you prepared?

205
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,760
The Great lmprovisation.

206
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:51,473
Man... They all have that.

207
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,101
You have to be...

208
00:23:55,310 --> 00:24:00,648
unique. Otherwise they won't
notice you. Want a smoke?

209
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:04,069
-lt's forbidden.
-Not for us.

210
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:11,076
l saw him smiling at you.

211
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:17,415
-Who?
-This one, on the stand.

212
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,921
You saw it?

213
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:27,008
He'd seen it. Really seen it.

214
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,222
l realised that next to me there
was someone like me. A friend.

215
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,600
What's your name?

216
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,019
-Marek Late.
-Gate?

217
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,438
Late.

218
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:47,112
Don't sweat it. My last name
also beginns with a ''p''. Wiktor.

219
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,698
Wiktor... my friend.

220
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:53,535
He suggested that we
should take the exam together.

221
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,496
He would play sour milk
and l would play a bottle.

222
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:59,165
Strange but very original.

223
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:03,294
lt's not easy to be
a believable bottle.

224
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:08,675
You've got to be sure
that you control what's inside.

225
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:13,138
That sour milk.
You've got to give it shape.

226
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:17,058
What would be sour milk
without a bottle?

227
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:20,270
A white spot.

228
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:24,983
You'll play the bottle,
l will be sour milk.

229
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:28,695
You are talented.
You'll make a career.

230
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:32,782
l've got other plans.

231
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:37,746
Come, l show you a real rehearsal
and a real actress.

232
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:46,212
-That's our task.
-And that we must do.

233
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:48,840
What's your answer?

234
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,761
-Martha.
-Go away.

235
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,096
My...

236
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:58,099
-You know.
-Leave me alone.

237
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:28,713
Love or power.
l have to choose between them.

238
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:35,011
Why can't l have everything?
After all l am a queen.

239
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,349
-l'm sorry...
-Well...

240
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:42,018
Very sorry.

241
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,814
-Am l awake?
-You're dreaming.

242
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,819
ls it a dream?

243
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,283
Will you stay?

244
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:04,666
Yes.

245
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:07,460
-Are you playing?
-No.

246
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:11,464
-So...
-Let the moment last.

247
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:42,829
-He pretends that he knows how to.
-And does he?

248
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:52,505
He'll say that he hasn't got
the right tools.

249
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:00,847
lf l had the right tools...

250
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,559
What the fuck?

251
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:20,533
What is she doing?

252
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:25,246
Pissing me off.

253
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,336
And what?

254
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:33,755
Drive.

255
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:42,931
How did you do it?

256
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,891
By magic.

257
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:57,529
ltching elbows,
buttertlies in the stomach,

258
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:02,534
runny brain, viral infection
of the thoughts. Only Martha.

259
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:11,334
Nobody, nothing. Just her.

260
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:20,802
She was everywhere.
Wherever l looked.

261
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:23,805
The streets were full of her.

262
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:30,895
Cars were humming. A light breeze
was murmuring in a cloud of fumes.

263
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,798
l thought then...

264
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:04,220
Now l know.

265
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:07,807
l know!

266
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,853
l know what it means to be a chief.
lt means to love.

267
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:14,981
Sure.

268
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:19,110
To love people and values.
And your goal.

269
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:22,322
But l'm in love.

270
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,574
l love her.

271
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,161
What's with your face? War paint?

272
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:31,414
We've been drafted.

273
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:36,920
How come?
What about Martha?

274
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,923
Drama school?

275
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:42,342
We flunked.

276
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,930
He was right. We flunked.

277
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:52,894
-As solders of the Polish Army...
-Not all of us. Wiktor passed.

278
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:57,482
-... guard the rule of the people...
-He was more convincing

279
00:30:57,691 --> 00:31:03,321
- as a buttermilk that l as a bottle.
- ... in alliance with Soviet Army...

280
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:08,118
My bottle couldn't hold sour milk.
lt was brim-full with love.

281
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:10,704
... from imperialism.

282
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:15,125
Martha didn't have time to come
and see me swear my oath.

283
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,794
Am l do be disloyal

284
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:24,217
to my country, let me be punished
by the people's justice.

285
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:29,764
Attention! Right, march!

286
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:39,858
l wrote to her many letters.

287
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:45,071
She didn't reply but l was sure
she was thinking of me.

288
00:31:56,207 --> 00:32:00,712
There is so quiet here at dusk.
Only the rustle of wind.

289
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:06,760
Up!

290
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:09,387
Down!

291
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:13,850
Get a fucking move on!
Up!

292
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:16,978
ls this ''down'' !
Up!

293
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:22,233
And such a warm wave comes
over me when l think of you.

294
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:24,861
Late, hurry up!

295
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,488
Down!

296
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:28,740
Move it!

297
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:33,453
Music exercises were my favourite.

298
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:38,667
l attended them all cause l wasn't
allowed to leave the base.

299
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,321
Dear God, that's me.

300
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,827
-Marek Late.
-Who?

301
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:17,580
l've not been in touch
but l have a request.

302
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,833
l want to leave here.

303
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:23,336
l'm in love, you know...
Love is everything.

304
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:27,382
-l have to get out of here.
-Then go.

305
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:05,378
l craved oranges.

306
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:07,505
Not stringy, Cuban

307
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:13,011
but rather Spanish, Moroccan
or Greek. Heaps of oranges.

308
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:18,933
Drink up. lt's on me.

309
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:22,729
But now we had to straighten
some things up.

310
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:26,566
We tried to do it
like seasoned actors.

311
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,160
You should get in now.
l'm well connected.

312
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:42,540
We'll see.
l don't want any favours.

313
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:46,503
You'll find out tomorrow.
Come now.

314
00:34:51,174 --> 00:34:54,636
Tomorrow...
How is it between you two?

315
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:07,315
Tasty bread sticks.
Why don't you talk to me?

316
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:12,487
Salty.
Why haven't you written to me?

317
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:21,037
Not that much.
lt was sudden. l don't know you.

318
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:28,586
Don't you like beer?
How is it between you two?

319
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:33,216
Not particularly.
l like him. We are pals.

320
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:38,513
What about you?
Let's have it out straight.

321
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:43,018
l love it.
l love Martha. And you?

322
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:47,731
Really?
What about me?

323
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:50,775
Yeah.
What are your plans?

324
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:59,617
lt's all the same to me.
Don't spoil the fun.

325
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:03,621
We haven't reached an agreement.

326
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:07,667
There were two of us,
and only one of her.

327
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:11,421
Do you like convertibles?

328
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:14,758
l like other things.

329
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,973
We are going to the Caribbean.

330
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:25,143
-Want to go with us?
-Yeah.

331
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:29,981
l passed.

332
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,317
PRONUNClATlON

333
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:51,628
Count your teeth with your tongue.
Left to right and back.

334
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:59,302
Stretch all the face muscels.
Pretend to be a roe deer.

335
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:04,265
Wake up, girls.
You are roe deer.

336
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:10,230
And now take a deep breath,

337
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:13,692
open your mouth
and tighten your muscels.

338
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:20,281
Congratulations.

339
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:24,285
Remember that it is a calling
to be an actor.

340
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:27,372
An actor should set
an example for others.

341
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,793
He reins over people's souls.
Keeps guard over his native tongue.

342
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:34,045
You don't remember me

343
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:38,091
but you came to my high school
to recite poetry.

344
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:41,678
-Quite so...
-You won.

345
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:44,681
-Should l give you a lift?
-What do you drive?

346
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:48,643
The same car as 20 years ago.

347
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:52,814
-We'll walk.
-You should never give up.

348
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:58,695
You must perform.
You know it well, Martha.

349
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:03,116
You play in the theatre.
Yes, step by step.

350
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:09,539
-You should build your happiness.
-l've got something better for you.

351
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:13,710
Something better. A plan.

352
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:18,256
l thought it through
while you were away.

353
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:25,263
l prepared everything.
My uncle has a jewellery store.

354
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:41,654
At the front there are
cameras, alarms,

355
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:44,491
at the back nothing.

356
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:47,535
You go in, open the vault,

357
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:52,248
and you find a great loot.
Diamonds, gold...

358
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:59,756
Uncle is a collector. You fill
your rucksack and leave.

359
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:04,386
And you are a king of life!

360
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:10,225
Once l read in a john,
''Check your shit for diamonds''.

361
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:14,229
Everything is possible.

362
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:26,574
He told you about the heist?

363
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:35,625
From now on l only eat caviar.

364
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:37,919
Scram!

365
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:42,882
You can eat cheese if you wish.

366
00:40:13,455 --> 00:40:15,665
What are you looking at?

367
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:18,918
You.

368
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:30,930
The tree is rustling.

369
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:35,185
Louder! l wanna hear it!

370
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:40,857
-Where is the second tree?
-What's your fucking hurry?

371
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,196
-Wiktor?
-Did you want to play alone?

372
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:50,241
Pear! Come on!

373
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:54,537
l wanna see pear on stage!

374
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:58,500
Get up!

375
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:02,003
Move it! Your lines.

376
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,632
l'm a pear and they are dwarfs.

377
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,051
Wiktor, now you!

378
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:14,307
Broader! We're in a theatre.

379
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:16,643
Broader. That's it!

380
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:22,023
Get up!

381
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:25,485
Don't destroy
the fucking branches.

382
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:30,573
What are you doing?

383
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:10,447
You're looking well.

384
00:42:12,198 --> 00:42:13,908
You too.

385
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,297
How old are you?

386
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:33,261
-As old as everybody else.
-l need someone like you. Worn out.

387
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:36,264
-For a commercial.
-What?

388
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:40,185
-l want you for a commercial.
-OK.

389
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,191
One condition.
No smoking on the set.

390
00:42:47,108 --> 00:42:50,862
l haven't really played
in anything.

391
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:55,617
Don't wanna end up as a detergent.
l'd rather play Hamlet.

392
00:42:55,825 --> 00:42:57,577
Give me a ring.

393
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:00,747
Tomasz Burzynski,
director

394
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:03,792
Your tree was great.

395
00:43:09,923 --> 00:43:12,717
The urinals are making music.

396
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:54,968
No! You can't be a whore.
As an actor and your teacher

397
00:43:55,176 --> 00:43:57,095
l repeat, ''No!''.

398
00:43:57,303 --> 00:44:03,059
You are to young and
too gifted to sell out.

399
00:44:03,852 --> 00:44:07,564
Your calling is to play
in a theatre.

400
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:12,193
You have to choose:
art or commercials.

401
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:13,695
Thank you.

402
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,907
-l believe in myself again.
-Give it to me.

403
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:31,379
So it won't tempt the others.

404
00:44:32,797 --> 00:44:35,633
Thanks. You've saved me.

405
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:42,599
Success, career...
This l can't decipher.

406
00:44:44,976 --> 00:44:48,521
-l see a loaded man.
-Who is he?

407
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:54,027
-lt's not that simple.
-Do you know?

408
00:44:56,988 --> 00:44:59,449
Someone very smart,

409
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:05,288
-with a sense of humour.
-l know who you're talking about.

410
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:08,917
Such people are a rarity.

411
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:11,461
Does he love me?

412
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:15,924
-l don't see it.
-Come on.

413
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:18,843
Look closely.

414
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:23,723
-l see an initial of his name.
-l know it.

415
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:28,311
-''W''
-''M''. The way l look at it.

416
00:45:30,772 --> 00:45:32,273
A good one.

417
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:59,801
This is Martha. Leave a massage
after the beep.

418
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:18,069
l've always wanted to bring
you here. lt's my place.

419
00:46:18,486 --> 00:46:20,530
Beautiful, isn't it?

420
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:25,660
-That's right.
-Everything is beneath you.

421
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:29,039
Beautiful.

422
00:46:30,957 --> 00:46:32,834
You know what?

423
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:36,880
Forget about Martha.

424
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:44,471
You forget about her.
Why should you force yourself?

425
00:46:45,096 --> 00:46:47,557
She's not a woman for you.

426
00:46:49,392 --> 00:46:52,187
You're hopelessly in love.

427
00:46:52,937 --> 00:46:57,901
Maybe there is hope.
And you're the one that's in love.

428
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:07,994
The other day in the bar you said
that it was all the same to you.

429
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:10,622
lt's not like that for me.

430
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:14,668
You know why you are here?

431
00:47:14,876 --> 00:47:18,171
-You brought me.
-l didn't want to be in the army.

432
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:25,679
And you got in cause my mom
was one of the judges.

433
00:47:26,262 --> 00:47:31,142
Don't act so surprised.
That was what you wanted.

434
00:47:31,893 --> 00:47:34,729
Did you think
you were so talented?

435
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:36,564
Marek!

436
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:42,112
You can't even handle your hands.
Such a great actor.

437
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:48,368
You and Martha are alike.

438
00:47:49,327 --> 00:47:54,541
You both come from small towns.
You think you're so special.

439
00:47:54,749 --> 00:47:56,376
Shit!

440
00:47:58,878 --> 00:48:02,507
Two knights were competing
for the hand of a princess.

441
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:05,301
She liked them both

442
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:09,973
and didn't know
how to choose between them.

443
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:13,393
Her father, the king, organised
a tournament,

444
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:16,521
which was supposed
to settle the matter.

445
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:20,900
- Greetings, noble sir.
- Greetings, spotless knight.

446
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:26,406
l swear on my honour that this
fight will be noble and beautiful.

447
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:29,534
My sentiments exactly.

448
00:48:32,078 --> 00:48:33,496
To the death.

449
00:48:35,206 --> 00:48:37,459
To the death.

450
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:52,682
Stop, noble knights.

451
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:56,227
Before you draw first blood

452
00:48:56,436 --> 00:48:59,356
let us talk about it peacefully.

453
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:05,820
The king should agree.
Let us talk.

454
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:09,115
Let us sit at a round table.

455
00:49:09,824 --> 00:49:12,035
Thanks. lt's a wrap.

456
00:49:12,952 --> 00:49:15,538
Great. They've bought it.

457
00:49:21,252 --> 00:49:23,880
Don't be mad. l was drunk.

458
00:49:27,592 --> 00:49:30,136
... the authorities
and the opposition.

459
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:34,432
They often knew each other
only from the newspapers.

460
00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:38,436
ln a few minutes they'll appear
together on our TV screens.

461
00:49:56,287 --> 00:49:59,040
People can come to an agreement.

462
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:03,461
Nothing is that difficult
that you have to fight over it.

463
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:06,506
We weren't enemies.
We were brothers,

464
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:10,677
accidentally standing
on opposite sides of a barricade.

465
00:50:10,885 --> 00:50:12,929
lt must end well.

466
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:34,576
Go!

467
00:50:35,577 --> 00:50:37,579
Wait a minute!

468
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:45,628
Marek,

469
00:50:45,837 --> 00:50:48,923
-l'm not playing with you.
-Hold on!

470
00:50:49,841 --> 00:50:54,429
When l was a kid l wanted
to eat my fill of oranges.

471
00:50:54,637 --> 00:50:56,306
You know...

472
00:50:58,016 --> 00:51:02,562
l used to say to my mom,
''l want oranges''.

473
00:51:03,688 --> 00:51:10,236
And she replied, ''Sonny,
they are on their way from Cuba.

474
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:14,824
They will arrive in a three
weeks time''. And she smiled.

475
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:18,828
Do you remember green oranges?

476
00:51:19,037 --> 00:51:23,958
Green, stringy and incredibly
sweet oranges.

477
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:29,464
-They were from Cuba. Remember?
-l remember parcels in the church.

478
00:51:29,673 --> 00:51:32,759
There was detergent
and cheese inside.

479
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:37,180
Some cheese was orange in colour.

480
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:38,890
Marek!

481
00:51:39,182 --> 00:51:40,642
Coming.

482
00:51:41,935 --> 00:51:44,354
-Go ahead.
-l'm going.

483
00:51:45,855 --> 00:51:48,108
l'll be right back.

484
00:51:49,025 --> 00:51:51,069
Go if you want.

485
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:56,533
l'm going.

486
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:01,329
For the road.

487
00:52:12,507 --> 00:52:15,510
-Check it out.
-What?

488
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:20,807
Oranges. Uncle Gierek is in town.

489
00:52:21,182 --> 00:52:23,893
-Uncle Gierek...
-Eat.

490
00:52:24,102 --> 00:52:26,813
-l'm full.
-Eat.

491
00:52:27,022 --> 00:52:29,607
-What's the matter?
-l can't.

492
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:34,029
ls everything all right?

493
00:52:34,237 --> 00:52:36,114
-Talk!
-lt's not.

494
00:52:36,322 --> 00:52:40,827
Then take her. Understood?
You've fucking won.

495
00:52:41,536 --> 00:52:44,164
-Devour her.
-God, you're stupid.

496
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:11,274
What have you done?

497
00:53:15,403 --> 00:53:17,447
Am l bleeding?

498
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:20,867
Yeah...

499
00:53:31,336 --> 00:53:32,962
Am l?

500
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:23,304
Nescafe, makes
you life colourtul.

501
00:54:57,922 --> 00:55:00,633
Hi. That's me.

502
00:55:05,513 --> 00:55:07,599
l can't talk.

503
00:55:09,934 --> 00:55:12,062
Marek is at my place.

504
00:55:30,246 --> 00:55:35,460
We moved in together.
She had a child but l didn't mind.

505
00:55:37,796 --> 00:55:39,839
We loved each other.

506
00:55:51,976 --> 00:55:55,563
Help me!

507
00:55:55,772 --> 00:55:59,526
-Nobody will help you!
-Stop!

508
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:05,115
Don't move! Release
that beauty or...

509
00:56:05,323 --> 00:56:07,492
-Or what?
-No!

510
00:56:08,076 --> 00:56:11,871
-What's the matter?
-Why don't you talk?

511
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:16,167
-Why don't we.
-What about?

512
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,817
My saviour.

513
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:47,615
For the first time l was tasting
the every day aspect of love.

514
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:50,744
l had to make a living.

515
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,377
A beautiful woman needs
a beautiful frame.

516
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:02,172
l started working like a madman.

517
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:18,980
-What are you doing?
-l love you.

518
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:21,941
Wiktor prefers blondes

519
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:34,120
Wiktor's victory

520
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:56,351
You're late.

521
00:57:56,893 --> 00:57:59,521
-What's that?
-Something stolen.

522
00:57:59,729 --> 00:58:02,482
That's for you. Try them on.

523
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:04,901
Try them on?

524
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:10,740
Stockings?

525
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:15,078
-People are looking.
-Try them on.

526
00:58:15,912 --> 00:58:18,039
They were very expensive.

527
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,749
OK.

528
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:22,293
Hurry up.

529
00:58:23,169 --> 00:58:25,213
Marek, let's get away.

530
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,676
-Where to?
-Wherever.

531
00:58:30,301 --> 00:58:33,888
-l'm suffocating here.
-What about Australia?

532
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:36,057
All right.

533
00:58:36,975 --> 00:58:39,310
Please, think it over.

534
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:42,397
With you l'll go to the end
of the earth.

535
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:45,692
Let's stay.

536
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,070
With you l can stay.

537
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:54,159
Come here. Give me a kiss.

538
00:59:00,373 --> 00:59:02,208
l love you.

539
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,970
Dear God?

540
00:59:15,388 --> 00:59:18,600
Dear God? Can you hear me?

541
00:59:20,352 --> 00:59:22,645
lt's me. Marek Late.

542
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:28,526
-l wanted to...
-This line is overloaded.

543
00:59:33,573 --> 00:59:39,204
No wonder. Millions of worshippers
were praying,

544
00:59:39,412 --> 00:59:43,166
focusing on themselves God's
attention. And l only

545
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:46,252
wanted to thank Him for her.

546
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:02,310
How is love?

547
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:04,437
Love?

548
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:09,317
-Chief, it's wonderful.
-Are you sure?

549
01:00:10,026 --> 01:00:13,488
Yes. Even if it's not wonderful
it's wonderful.

550
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:16,616
These are the best moments
of my life.

551
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:23,081
Why are you lying?

552
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:33,299
Take your mark.

553
01:00:36,761 --> 01:00:39,139
-lntroduce yourself.
-Marek Late.

554
01:00:39,764 --> 01:00:42,434
- Agency?
- l'm an actor.

555
01:00:42,684 --> 01:00:44,019
The sides.

556
01:00:44,477 --> 01:00:45,812
Right side.

557
01:00:47,272 --> 01:00:48,398
Left.

558
01:00:55,822 --> 01:00:57,240
Show me joy.

559
01:00:59,951 --> 01:01:01,161
Sadness.

560
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,458
Anger.

561
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:12,422
Absentmindedness.

562
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:17,052
Love.

563
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,808
-What kind of commercial is it?
-You'll find out if they choose you.

564
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:25,977
Thanks.

565
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:29,272
And do something
with those hands.

566
01:01:44,245 --> 01:01:46,373
Your plans for the future?

567
01:01:46,581 --> 01:01:51,961
l've got a few
but l don't want to jinx it

568
01:01:52,379 --> 01:01:56,299
- by elaborating on them.
- And your private plans?

569
01:01:57,258 --> 01:02:01,221
-l'm planing to go on a vacation.
-You can afford it.

570
01:02:01,429 --> 01:02:06,309
You're a successful man.
lt's rare among your generation.

571
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:09,020
You know...

572
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:14,901
lt's a very complicated issue.

573
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:20,448
We, now in our thirties,
are in a difficult situation.

574
01:02:21,032 --> 01:02:26,371
We were too young to fight
for freedom and now we're too old

575
01:02:26,705 --> 01:02:31,167
to take advantage
of our European upbringing.

576
01:02:32,335 --> 01:02:34,963
We have a special task.

577
01:02:35,171 --> 01:02:38,299
We should not let anybody
call us ''the lost generation''.

578
01:02:40,135 --> 01:02:45,890
Beautifully put. How about love?
Do women always

579
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:48,518
choose strong men with money?

580
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:52,689
That's a stereotype. Women

581
01:02:52,897 --> 01:02:57,360
don't need money. They eat
like birds, drink very little

582
01:02:57,569 --> 01:03:00,363
and don't spend
on lady friends.

583
01:03:37,233 --> 01:03:39,527
-Go ahead.
-Shall we?

584
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:43,698
l mastered the hamburger.
Now you try it.

585
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:47,911
l mastered the hamburger.
Now you try it.

586
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:00,382
Yes...

587
01:04:05,845 --> 01:04:07,764
What's up?

588
01:04:09,557 --> 01:04:11,601
l'm all right.

589
01:04:13,687 --> 01:04:15,063
Really.

590
01:04:17,482 --> 01:04:18,817
OK.

591
01:04:28,576 --> 01:04:30,829
l've go to go.

592
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:35,041
-l didn't hear you come in.
-Who was it?

593
01:04:37,502 --> 01:04:42,632
-We have to pay the rent.
-Was it Wiktor?

594
01:04:43,216 --> 01:04:45,010
Turn it off.

595
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:51,808
Yes, it was Wiktor.
He has a job for you.

596
01:04:52,976 --> 01:04:55,103
What kind of a job?

597
01:04:56,604 --> 01:04:58,815
Background in a commercial.

598
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,043
Cut!

599
01:05:21,504 --> 01:05:23,340
Thanks a lot.

600
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:28,219
-Another take.
-l'll help you.

601
01:05:29,137 --> 01:05:30,805
l can manage.

602
01:05:31,806 --> 01:05:33,850
-Camera!
-Rolling.

603
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,352
Action!

604
01:05:43,693 --> 01:05:46,112
l mastered the hamburger.

605
01:05:48,448 --> 01:05:51,493
Now you try it. Yuck!

606
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:56,748
No!

607
01:06:12,013 --> 01:06:13,848
l'm going out!

608
01:06:27,445 --> 01:06:28,905
Martha?

609
01:06:37,497 --> 01:06:39,791
Will you marry me?

610
01:06:52,303 --> 01:06:55,015
Long or short answer?

611
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:57,392
Short.

612
01:06:59,602 --> 01:07:01,896
l'll think about it.

613
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:55,200
Go.

614
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:14,886
This is Martha. Leave a massage
after the beep.

615
01:09:19,617 --> 01:09:21,494
Let's go, son.

616
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:33,923
You've changed.

617
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:41,014
l'd changed. They remained
the same and l...

618
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:46,728
Why hadn't l noticed it before?
Why didn't anybody tell me?

619
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:02,202
End of the route!

620
01:10:06,122 --> 01:10:09,376
-Why?
-lt doesn't pay to go further.

621
01:11:00,677 --> 01:11:01,720
Late?

622
01:11:05,807 --> 01:11:08,935
Marek Late?
Don't you recognise me?

623
01:11:09,144 --> 01:11:13,023
l recognised you at once.
Everybody knows your face.

624
01:11:13,231 --> 01:11:18,361
-Do l know you?
-Maciek. We used to jog together.

625
01:11:18,903 --> 01:11:21,573
-You wore glasses.
-Had surgery.

626
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:27,162
Looking great, pal. You've made it
in Warsaw. Everybody envies you.

627
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:32,417
l've seen you in that commercial.
What a career.

628
01:11:33,626 --> 01:11:37,047
-Can l give you a lift?
-l'd rather walk.

629
01:11:37,255 --> 01:11:40,467
We have to celebrate our meeting.

630
01:11:41,926 --> 01:11:44,971
What do you say? My treat.
Get in!

631
01:11:59,069 --> 01:12:00,820
Will you eat something?

632
01:12:07,952 --> 01:12:11,539
He got laid off
and for his severance pay

633
01:12:12,207 --> 01:12:14,709
he bought a TV and a satellite
dish.

634
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:19,923
Now he switches between channels.
Sometimes he catches you.

635
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:23,134
You look the same as before.

636
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:25,261
You haven't changed.

637
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:30,600
But the world has.
l'm glad you're a success.

638
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:35,980
Marek?

639
01:12:36,189 --> 01:12:38,942
-Where to?
-l'll be right back.

640
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:49,160
Let's have it out strait.

641
01:12:49,828 --> 01:12:53,957
l don't wear a wedding band.
Business, you know.

642
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:56,668
l make balloons.

643
01:12:58,336 --> 01:13:01,006
-l don't complain. Girls!
-Balloons...

644
01:13:01,214 --> 01:13:05,510
- Get ready. We'll need a refill.
- Of the cream.

645
01:13:06,094 --> 01:13:10,223
-Why are you so quiet?
-l'm talking the whole time.

646
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:14,436
l know all of you.
Everybody envies you here.

647
01:13:14,644 --> 01:13:16,771
-Fuck off!
-What?

648
01:13:19,524 --> 01:13:20,650
Pour.

649
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:34,122
And the ducks quack-quack-quack...

650
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:35,999
And the cow...

651
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:44,883
l looked into the eyes
of an actor from Warsaw.

652
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:51,431
Don't complain.

653
01:14:14,287 --> 01:14:17,165
Come here!
Don't sweat it!

654
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:39,938
This is Martha.
Leave a massage after the beep.

655
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:42,357
Marek!

656
01:14:44,901 --> 01:14:46,569
l'm done.

657
01:15:02,377 --> 01:15:04,546
l've got my own.

658
01:15:08,842 --> 01:15:12,387
You've left me. You've fled.

659
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:22,856
''The most important thing
is to be a chief!''

660
01:15:28,903 --> 01:15:31,781
Pride! l don't have any pride?

661
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,658
Really!

662
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:44,461
l don't have any pride?

663
01:17:31,609 --> 01:17:34,154
Dear God, and now what?

664
01:17:47,917 --> 01:17:49,127
No!

665
01:17:57,093 --> 01:17:59,512
Will you marry me?

666
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:14,652
Long or short answer?

667
01:18:15,695 --> 01:18:17,197
Short.

668
01:18:19,157 --> 01:18:21,534
l'll think about it.

669
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:35,775
There is a time in a man's life

670
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:39,446
that although he didn't die
he is born anew.

671
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:43,700
lt's a good time. The best.

672
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:49,581
Unless you are not you.

673
01:19:56,171 --> 01:19:59,007
l won't need them any more.

674
01:20:05,889 --> 01:20:08,725
-Did you say something?
-Rest.

675
