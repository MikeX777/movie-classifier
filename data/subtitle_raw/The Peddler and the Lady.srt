1
00:01:42,757 --> 00:01:47,680
What fresh fish!
Excellent with pasta and broccoli, folks!

2
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,558
It doesn't look that fresh to me.
- You must be joking, ma'am! Blasphemy!

3
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:55,112
It just arrived by plane.
We're three: fisherman, pilot and myself.

4
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,812
"The Peppino Organization"!

5
00:01:56,882 --> 00:02:02,252
Oranges! Get your oranges!
Oranges from Palermo, 3 lire per kilo!

6
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,301
What apples I got today!
What apples!

7
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:09,983
He's alive! His eyes seems to be saying,
"I was underwater just a half hour ago."

8
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,724
Be careful, don't let it escape.
- Put it on a leash.

9
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:18,250
Peppino, what will you give me?
- For you? A pearl necklace! - How sweet!

10
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,744
I'd like something good.
I have guests, don't make me look bad.

11
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:25,075
Look: it's a beauty. Shines so
brightly it could be a reflector.

12
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:30,418
Salt, pepper, garlic, olive oil, herbs and
you'll eat your fingers too. - From rage!

13
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:34,865
Hey, bad hair day, can't
you mind your own broccoli?

14
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:38,827
That stink is drying up the fruit.
- Your tongue should dry up.

15
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:41,797
You don't like to hear me, eh?
Find another market!

16
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:43,110
Mr. Peppino!

17
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:47,546
One shouldn't be too familiar with some
people. - Big deal, some loss!

18
00:02:47,616 --> 00:02:50,912
Mr. Peppino! - Go on,
the lady is claiming the corpse.

19
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:55,153
You make me want to hurl, got it?
- I'd like to hurl you!

20
00:02:55,366 --> 00:03:00,430
Oranges! Lovely oranges!
These truly are fresh! Come to me, folks!

21
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,024
Come here.
- Sorry, ma'am, common people.

22
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:06,968
Give me two anchovies. - I want it clean.
- Right away. To the surgeon!

23
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:09,177
Merlino, laparotomize it!

24
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,816
You know I don't like water!
- That's why you should bathe!

25
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:16,868
You know I like clean people!

26
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:20,948
<i>Wash your own conscience then!</i>
- Will you give me some anchovies?

27
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,955
She wanted to kill herself.

28
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:26,102
They're young, who knows
what they get in their heads.

29
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:29,238
And they don't know..
Is that clear, Mr. Eugenio?

30
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:34,875
And then, I hadn't said anything to her.
Just one tiny word, like that. Bam!

31
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,627
You know what? It's true.

32
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:42,859
We Neapolitans, we have a charm,
we have a special attraction,

33
00:03:43,032 --> 00:03:46,041
just a look, one word to a woman, and..

34
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:48,469
You'd think this a blessing,

35
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:52,757
Mr. Eugenio, but it's a curse.
A curse we have in our eyes.

36
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:56,007
Have you ever thought of taking a wife?
- A wife!

37
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,482
Come now, let's not even
joke about it. A wife!

38
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:03,722
How can it work? There are too many
women who wouldn't leave me alone.

39
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,084
Just as well, deep down I'm
just a romantic. - There you go.

40
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:12,404
Thank you, Mr. Eugenio.
- Ah, for the boy. - Thank you.

41
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,016
Thank the gentleman.
- Thank you.

42
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,709
I don't like how you said, "Thank you".
You're fined, see?

43
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,061
If anybody wants me, I'm with Peppino.

44
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:25,632
Damn it to hell!

45
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:30,705
Hurry or my lady'll yell at me.
- How could she yell at a doll like you?

46
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:33,512
Peppi, you rule, eh?
- Always, Lambchop.

47
00:04:33,582 --> 00:04:36,032
Cut the "Lambchop", my name is Aurelio.

48
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:40,412
Whatever! What do you need?
Two mullets? A mackerel? A whale?

49
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,767
Two anchovies.
- One at a time. Well then?

50
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:48,612
She wants them without bones. - There
are always bones. Right, Lambchop?

51
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:50,987
Again, "Lambchop". My name is Aurelio.

52
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:55,015
It's no use telling her, for her there's
only Peppino. The others are ugly.

53
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:58,511
What a rosebud!
His beauty has no equal!

54
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:02,306
Who'll take this here vegetable?
Who'll ever take it?

55
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,821
MerlÃ¬, remove the bones!

56
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,145
Don't forget the game, eh?
- How could I? It's Rome-Lazio.

57
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,848
It figures. When it comes to
playing around, he's always there.

58
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:18,921
Hi, Elide, how are you?
- He made my head blow up like a balloon.

59
00:05:19,264 --> 00:05:21,217
Tie it down, or it'll fly off.

60
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,630
Be careful, or I'll make
something fly on your head!

61
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,255
Here you go, don Peppi.

62
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:28,526
Shall we say, 18 lire?
- Let's say 17.

63
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:32,715
What 17? You crazy? Causes bad luck.
- Will you give me two anchovies?

64
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:37,320
When shall we give you a permanent?
- Knock it off, Lambchop, I'm busy.

65
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,922
Leave her alone, Lambchop,
or he who invented her will get mad.

66
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:43,904
Oranges! Such lovely oranges!

67
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:48,165
Oranges from Palermo, 3 lire per kilo,
folks! What apples I have!

68
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:51,910
Checking to see if it has a fever?
Always touching!

69
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,110
Will you give me two anchovies?

70
00:05:55,201 --> 00:06:00,251
Over one kilo. - Peppino, patience.
With women you must rule, but with class.

71
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:03,622
<i>Mr. Aurelio, there's people in the shop.</i>
- I'm coming.

72
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:06,600
We meet at three at the bus stop.
Bye, Peppi. - Bye.

73
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,734
<i>You want some chicory, hey!</i>

74
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:13,189
<i>What chicory!
Chicory, lettuce, broccoli! Hey!</i>

75
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:17,355
Peppi! There's the goods, the goods!

76
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,516
Come on all, no time to lose!
Sardines, mullet, cod, all fresh stuff.

77
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:29,408
Please, how can I serve you?
Some mullets or something to fry up?

78
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:30,697
Two anchovies.

79
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:35,073
Octopus, squid, sole? Or shrimp, tuna,
sturgeon, perch, anything you want.

80
00:06:35,143 --> 00:06:38,876
No, thanks so much.
I only want a fish I can boil.

81
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:43,333
In a blink, I'll get you a beaut!
Something unique. A marvel!

82
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,452
One moment!

83
00:06:44,522 --> 00:06:48,569
Look, what a beauty! Shall I weigh it?
- No, I'm taking that.

84
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,589
I'm sorry, but this is for lovely lady.
- No, it's not for the lady.

85
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:56,904
We'll say 80 lire and pay him. - Why?
- Because you act like you're the boss.

86
00:06:56,974 --> 00:07:01,117
Young man, this attitude is inappropriate.
- Where did this guy come from?

87
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,723
All strangers, today. Any Romans here?

88
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:08,557
Roman or not, you're all witnesses
that I've been here nearly an hour.

89
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:12,705
Nearly an hour you've been touching
not saying a word. What do you want?

90
00:07:12,775 --> 00:07:14,065
I want that bass!

91
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:18,111
I'm sorry, but the lady's getting it.
Thank you. Come to me whenever you like.

92
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:21,277
Sorry, ma'am, but out of principle,
I won't give in.

93
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:24,743
You're rude. - No, I'm not.
I'm not an imbecile, that's all.

94
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:26,094
You're not?

95
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:30,236
If I wore a skirt, a bonnet, and
lipstick, you'd be acting differently.

96
00:07:30,306 --> 00:07:32,978
And how! How I'd laugh.
- This isn't a joke!

97
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:37,168
Who's joking? I'm busy working.
- Busy cheating the public!

98
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:39,609
What?
- You cheat and deceive us!

99
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:43,999
Now, you're being offensive.
- No, sir, I'm only giving the facts.

100
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:46,686
What facts? I put this aside for me.

101
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:51,576
Let him have it, it doesn't matter.
- No. Damn it, I gave the bass to her!

102
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:54,659
Two anchovies.
- Shut up! Don't you see I'm in a mess?

103
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:58,302
This individual not only
cheats an honest professional

104
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:02,872
to flirt with ladies, but takes
advantage of the state of emergency,

105
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:07,036
allows himself, in a public square,
to make illegal sales.

106
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:11,690
This results in a dearth of
goods for the people's consumption.

107
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,150
In my country, we call that oppression.

108
00:08:15,263 --> 00:08:18,210
What a blabber after
he was mute for an hour!

109
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,812
How can one speak?
You're always talking!

110
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:24,308
But you won't fool me.
The bass is mine!

111
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,483
No, the bass is the lady's!

112
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,392
Alright, get it over with!

113
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:31,886
Who came first? Him or the lady?
- I did! They're all witnesses.

114
00:08:31,956 --> 00:08:35,038
Why didn't you buy it first?
- Yeah. Why? - Because..

115
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:39,702
I wanted to find out the price first,
but he was busy flirting with the lady.

116
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:43,545
Me? But how..
May I be struck by lightning!

117
00:08:43,615 --> 00:08:46,757
I do what I always do.
There was this one over here..

118
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:52,558
I said, "Sir?" and he just kept
touching things without saying..

119
00:08:52,628 --> 00:08:56,152
You're a liar. I have witnesses!
- He's a liar! How true.

120
00:08:56,222 --> 00:08:58,277
See. They all know him.

121
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:02,424
Why wasn't there a price on
the fish you sold to the lady?

122
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:07,421
Because I wanted to eat it.
- Why did you give it to the lady?

123
00:09:11,088 --> 00:09:12,138
I get it.

124
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:20,632
Let me see your license.

125
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:25,156
Excuse me, ma'am, but it's a matter..

126
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,172
She's gone, your lady.

127
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:32,039
I see that. But you're always here.
You're worse than Giordano Bruno!

128
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,543
Sorry.

129
00:09:33,613 --> 00:09:36,373
Let me see your license.
- Here.

130
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,274
Give him the bass.
- It's there. Is he crippled?

131
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:42,959
I have good legs and a great brain.
- Sounds good fried.

132
00:09:43,706 --> 00:09:46,164
We agreed on 80 lire.
- Yeah.

133
00:09:47,315 --> 00:09:49,165
May I go?
- Yes, go ahead.

134
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:52,630
See you later, Don Giovanni!
- Watch out for the bones!

135
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,619
For now, keep it.

136
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:58,940
Couldn't you say something?
You stood there as mute as a codfish.

137
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,109
Whenever I talk, you get mad.

138
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:05,665
You just should've said what happened.
- I though the gentleman was right.

139
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:07,969
Yeah? I'll put your head in here!

140
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,968
Don't get angry! For 50 lire?

141
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:13,120
The lady was worth it, right?
- You can say it out loud.

142
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,000
If you don't mind your own business,
you'll get a mullet on your muzzle.

143
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,927
I'd like to see it.
When I say the truth, I say it!

144
00:10:19,997 --> 00:10:22,267
And when I throw a mullet, I throw it!

145
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:26,152
Can I get two anchovies?
- I don't have any! Got it? Yes or no?

146
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:31,647
So I told him, "The fish is for
the lady. Shut your face." - What?

147
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:36,250
"And shut your face." He turned pale as
a corpse. He wanted to get me in trouble?

148
00:10:36,773 --> 00:10:39,362
He almost got himself in trouble.
- And the lady?

149
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:42,453
She looked at me with those eyes,
Lambchop.. - Aurelio.

150
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:44,874
Two eyes that looked as big as four.

151
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,773
Four! - Then she smiled
and said, "Thank you, Sir".

152
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:50,060
"Sir"?
- Well, "Thank you, young man."

153
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,685
She took my hand and as she held it
she said, "See you tomorrow".

154
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:57,998
Come on! - What?
You think only you have adventures?

155
00:10:58,068 --> 00:11:00,885
Peppi, go on.
- Go on? I'm done. That's it.

156
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,272
That's it?

157
00:11:03,388 --> 00:11:07,536
Where's the adventure?
- And the handshake, Lambchop?

158
00:11:07,671 --> 00:11:11,570
So what?
- What? It's a sure thing.

159
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:16,160
How does she look up close?
Does she look one of mine?

160
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:21,417
The usual? - No, she's a unique type,
young man. This time, we're there.

161
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:26,295
Piazza del Popolo!

162
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,960
Is this a dream? - Are you nuts?
- Lambchop, come on.

163
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,026
Who did you see, may we know?
- Look, it's her.

164
00:11:54,265 --> 00:11:55,464
Let's go.

165
00:11:58,977 --> 00:12:02,042
Are you sure?
- Of course, she looked like a queen.

166
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:07,245
Aren't you going in?
- You think so?

167
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:10,116
We got off the bus to look
at her in the window?

168
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:14,004
So I should go inside?
- But of course! Come on, go ahead.

169
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:18,149
Then it's true that you.. - Uh!
- Shook her by the hand? - Uh!

170
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:20,811
Go forward, then, and show them..

171
00:12:21,195 --> 00:12:22,602
Peppi, rule!

172
00:12:23,388 --> 00:12:25,693
Don't worry, Aurelio, you know me.

173
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,988
Give me.. Well, you know..
come on..

174
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:16,007
And now?

175
00:13:16,945 --> 00:13:20,575
Now, I'll pay, tell me how much.

176
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:24,509
Yes, how much.
You can't find stuff like this anymore.

177
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:27,486
In that case, it's unnecessary to pay.

178
00:13:28,282 --> 00:13:29,946
I'll ask the manager.

179
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,395
Fine.

180
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:40,329
Good day.

181
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:45,377
You don't recognize me?

182
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,864
I can tell.
You're looking at me like, "Who's this?"

183
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:51,188
You really don't remember?

184
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:53,489
The gentleman, this morning.

185
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,923
Then they fined me.

186
00:13:55,993 --> 00:13:59,987
Yes, the fishmonger!
- The fishmonger! Is it he? - Yes, it is!

187
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:03,884
Forgive me, I'm to blame.
- For heaven's sake, it was nothing.

188
00:14:03,954 --> 00:14:07,909
I'm sorry I couldn't please you.
- It doesn't matter. Maybe another time.

189
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:13,062
May I.. offer you something?
- No, thank you.

190
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,886
May I ask you a favor then?

191
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:18,732
What is it?

192
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:24,238
Well, I'd be pleased to send to your home
something nice, some fresh fish.

193
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:27,196
Yes, why not?
If only our butcher were like him!

194
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,484
Certainly.
It matters a lot to me.

195
00:14:30,388 --> 00:14:33,468
I have a delivery boy,
if you don't live too far..

196
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:36,062
Great! We'll give you our address.

197
00:14:36,284 --> 00:14:40,087
This way we'll have the most
elegant fishmonger in the whole city.

198
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:44,908
Is it clear?
- Very clear.

199
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,870
Hello. Diana wasn't home.
I'll call her later.

200
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,864
OK then, Mr..
- Peppino Corradini.

201
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:52,984
Very good. Thank you. Good day.

202
00:14:53,146 --> 00:14:55,054
Giorgio, why don't you call Carla?

203
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:57,671
No, she always goes
to the match on Sundays.

204
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,707
Who's that?
- A nice guy.

205
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:02,683
A fishmonger.
- Damn!

206
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:05,724
Sir!
- Ah, right.

207
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:11,625
How much? - Two cups,
two glasses, two drinks: 120 lire.

208
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,872
It's expensive, eh?
- Oh, well..

209
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:20,277
I'm sorry.
- Imagine how I feel.

210
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:27,602
I was about to go in.
- If you only knew!

211
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:29,973
What did you do?
- I did it all. All!

212
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:32,951
Driver!
- What now?

213
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:35,201
I need some air, to breathe.

214
00:15:39,918 --> 00:15:41,968
To the Pincio, Casina Valadier.

215
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,900
What a service. And what women!
Lambchop, I feel like a gentleman.

216
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,820
You're telling me?
Get on!

217
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:04,306
She invited you so quickly?
- "They" invited me, little one.

218
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:06,764
They were two ladies.
One was her friend.

219
00:16:06,895 --> 00:16:09,122
Ah, a friend!
Why didn't you call me?

220
00:16:09,987 --> 00:16:14,373
She's high class, they were drinking tea.
Real tea, with lemon slices.

221
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:17,231
Tomorrow we'll go then.
- Where? - Their place.

222
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:21,528
Are you crazy? I'm bringing the fish.
What would you bring? Some bangs?

223
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:25,226
Peppi, I was kidding.
I'm too busy tomorrow.

224
00:16:25,807 --> 00:16:29,592
I have this lady on my hands.
A hot little number!

225
00:16:32,046 --> 00:16:34,995
Peppi, if Campo de' Fiori
could see us now!

226
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:37,597
Let's not speak of such riffraff.
- Well,

227
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:40,743
now you're exaggerating,
because you were born there.

228
00:16:42,755 --> 00:16:46,752
You're wrong. I look good in gloves..
- My gloves!

229
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:49,150
and with women of a higher class.

230
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:52,942
If Elide could hear you.
- Don't speak of her. - Well.

231
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:54,814
But something was there.

232
00:16:54,884 --> 00:16:57,655
Yeah, she was always around, so..

233
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,228
I can't stand to see women cry.
- She's a good girl.

234
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,369
She works, she's sure of herself.
And she's honest.

235
00:17:04,508 --> 00:17:08,350
Heavens, who can deny it?
But.. she's a fruit seller.

236
00:17:08,552 --> 00:17:10,362
She's not for us, Peppi.

237
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:16,748
Can you imagine tomorrow?
She is truly something else..

238
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,911
Careful, they'll give us a fine.

239
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:27,548
Good day. Is the lady in?
- Who are you?

240
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,739
Who is it?

241
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:32,480
Oh, good day, ma'am.
- Good day. What do you want?

242
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:34,622
But don't you remember?

243
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:38,599
I'm.. that gentleman from
yesterday from the tea room.

244
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:41,854
The fishmonger?
Heck, I didn't even recognize you!

245
00:17:41,924 --> 00:17:44,724
Wait a moment and I'll get Elsa.
- Thank you.

246
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:47,079
Elsa! Elsa!

247
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:52,680
Here's our nice fishmonger
who's kept his word.

248
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,167
Unlike our grocer!
What a rogue he is.

249
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:58,167
He promised us ham for days
but what did we get: nothing!

250
00:17:58,237 --> 00:18:02,465
Did you bring something? - Yes,
my boy couldn't come, so I sent myself.

251
00:18:02,726 --> 00:18:04,995
I brought some fish bisque.
- Soup bisque!

252
00:18:05,065 --> 00:18:07,970
Great! Let's see it!
Let's go in the kitchen.

253
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:13,918
Come, let's see the fish bisque!

254
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,159
It's nothing special,
but it's not frozen, it's very fresh.

255
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:20,783
How they shine!
They're full of phosphorus.

256
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:25,762
At night, instead of using a flashlight,
I put a mullet in my buttonhole.

257
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:29,529
How nice!
Are they really fresh?

258
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:32,458
The freshest, ma'am. Smell?
- How scary.

259
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,321
What a smell!
They remind of the sea, the beach.

260
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:39,450
That one's still alive, poor thing.
- They all are. - No, that doesn't move.

261
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,479
Well, he's bashful. He's in awe
in being somebody else's house.

262
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:46,782
How much do we owe you?
- Please, it's on the house.

263
00:18:46,852 --> 00:18:50,471
No, you can't. Sorry.
- Please, be so nice as to accept.

264
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:53,746
But, why?
- Well, let's accept or he'll be offended.

265
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,583
We'll pay him another time.
- No, I'll get some money.

266
00:18:56,653 --> 00:19:00,836
Ma'am, you tell her.
- Elsa, it's not polite to insist.

267
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:04,582
How do you prepare it?
- There's only one way: mine.

268
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:05,807
How then?

269
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,417
The old way.
- Which one?

270
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,651
With garlic and olive oil.
- And the modern way?

271
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:15,512
Just garlic.
- Just garlic? Pull the other one.

272
00:19:16,581 --> 00:19:19,986
What's that? Listen,
I'll explain to you how it's done.

273
00:19:20,154 --> 00:19:24,596
Take two cloves of garlic and slice them.
Put a whole one for the scent.

274
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:28,760
Slit it, first, or it'll burst.
Sautee everything with a lot of oil.

275
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:31,219
A lot.. but not too much.

276
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:36,552
When it turns golden, add the tomatoes,
salt, pepper, a little parsley,

277
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:39,699
let it simmer slowly,
and then add the fish.

278
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:41,584
Got it?
- No.

279
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:46,233
And you? - Me neither.
It's simple.. - Easier said than done.

280
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,153
I've done it many times.
- What, you're also a cook?

281
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:52,326
Not a cook,
but for seafood I'm second to none.

282
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:56,466
If the fish were sure to be cooked
by me, they'd be fished smiling,

283
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:59,685
as to say, "How wonderful,
we're in Peppino's hands!''

284
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:03,555
Bravo, Mr. Peppino,
but you must tell me what we owe you.

285
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:08,572
If you keep saying that I'll throw
myself on the ground and start crying!

286
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:11,730
You're such a meanie, Elsa.
Isn't that right?

287
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,694
Are you talking about her?
On the contrary, I'd say..

288
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,202
that..

289
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,788
Yeah, whatever. But this fish
bisque, how do you make it?

290
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:23,615
I can do it! If the gas is steady,
it's all done in half an hour.

291
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:27,772
No, God forbid! It's too much trouble.
- If you don't want to, that's different.

292
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:30,549
Would you really make it?
- No, don't insist.

293
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:35,324
Let me insist, or it's useless! I brought
the fish, you don't know how to cook it,

294
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,287
so let me do it. - Right! But you're sure
it's not too much trouble?

295
00:20:39,357 --> 00:20:41,816
Trouble? It's fun, a pleasure indeed.

296
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:46,460
Then it's decided, Elsa, let's not argue.
Rosa, help him. Do whatever he says.

297
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:49,047
Take off your coat.
- Immediately.

298
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:52,718
This soup will knock your socks off!
- Bravo, Peppino.

299
00:20:52,788 --> 00:20:56,135
Here is my apron with pretty flowers.

300
00:20:56,991 --> 00:21:00,229
Perfect! You're the most
elegant cook in town.

301
00:21:00,963 --> 00:21:04,847
But it's a bit loose. - No, it's perfect.
- Now, to work!

302
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:08,560
I appoint you my assistant.

303
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,446
Give me a pan, garlic and olive oil.
- Even oil!

304
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:16,173
We're going to watch, it's interesting.
- No, if you stay, I'll get confused.

305
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:18,661
I get it, you want to
flirt with your helper.

306
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:22,110
OK, we'll see you later.
Good luck. - Thanks!

307
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:25,781
And don't seduce Rosa, OK?
- He'd find it a little difficult.

308
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,282
Is that so?
- Keep your hands off!

309
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:32,608
Peel the oil and give me the garlic.
I mean, give me.. what? Here!

310
00:21:33,637 --> 00:21:35,150
Black market, eh?

311
00:21:37,348 --> 00:21:40,365
Have you been here long?
- Four months.

312
00:21:40,795 --> 00:21:42,245
You like it, right?

313
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:48,537
What's the name..?
- Rosa Muzi from Tagliacozzo.

314
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,596
I mean the tall blonde lady.
- Ah, Mrs. Elsa.

315
00:21:53,408 --> 00:21:55,155
Her name is Bianchini.

316
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:59,565
Does her husband come home late?
- She has no husband.

317
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:01,183
Yeah, the boyfriend.

318
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:02,829
Not either.

319
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:09,519
What the hell you doing? That's expensive!
- Hey, don't yell! It'll be tastier.

320
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:12,498
What's the fuss? As if you paid for it!

321
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:17,569
It's served. - Bravo, you're even a waiter!
- Waiter, cook, all.

322
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:19,440
I'd like to taste it.

323
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:23,349
Sure, at the place of honor.
Elsa is next to you, OK? - I'm honored.

324
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:25,469
So, how did our Peppino behave?

325
00:22:25,867 --> 00:22:27,882
He asked me a ton of questions!

326
00:22:27,952 --> 00:22:30,359
I see why you wanted to be alone with her!

327
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:33,503
He wanted to know the name of Mrs. Elsa.

328
00:22:33,926 --> 00:22:35,803
And if she were married.

329
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:40,260
Did he ask anything about you?
- No, he always spoke about Mrs. Elsa.

330
00:22:40,622 --> 00:22:44,322
Mr. Peppino, how discourteous.
I confess, I'm a little jealous.

331
00:22:44,392 --> 00:22:47,482
But when I smell this bisque,
I forgive you.

332
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:48,864
Shall we sit?

333
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,328
Now let's the judge the cook.
- I'm not worried.

334
00:22:52,624 --> 00:22:53,800
Young lady!

335
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:58,202
If you allow, I'll serve, because you
must know how to catch the fish. Please.

336
00:23:18,687 --> 00:23:23,776
Bravo! Fishmonger, cook, waiter,
dancer, and a grand gentleman!

337
00:23:59,264 --> 00:24:00,305
Ma'am.

338
00:24:00,658 --> 00:24:02,888
The telephone.
- Coming.

339
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:07,970
It's your turn. Are you happy?
Come on, don't make me beg you!

340
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,718
Finally!

341
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:45,206
I wish this record were
as large as St. Peter's Square.

342
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:47,938
Wouldn't you get tired?
- Dancing with you?

343
00:24:59,255 --> 00:25:02,185
That's enough, Mr. Peppino.
I'm a little tired.

344
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:17,090
I'm sorry. I have much to do.
And it's getting late.

345
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:25,247
I'm leaving now.
Don't worry.

346
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,538
But.. May I come back in the evening?

347
00:25:31,827 --> 00:25:34,626
Mrs. Olga was kind enough to ask me.

348
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:38,284
And I would be so happy.

349
00:25:38,855 --> 00:25:39,902
Rosa!

350
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,339
Good day.
And thank you.

351
00:25:55,743 --> 00:25:57,287
Well?
- Well?

352
00:25:58,029 --> 00:25:59,779
What do you want from me?

353
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:02,757
Get my hat, I'm ruined.

354
00:26:06,351 --> 00:26:11,482
Then we talked about music
In fact, at some point I put on a record..

355
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:13,472
What a tune!

356
00:26:14,217 --> 00:26:16,264
<i># If I miss you..</i>

357
00:26:16,464 --> 00:26:18,354
"Slow"?
- Almost.

358
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:20,383
We were sitting..

359
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:22,655
Some armchairs!

360
00:26:23,231 --> 00:26:25,631
"Frau" brand?
- Yes, almost.

361
00:26:26,025 --> 00:26:28,634
She looked me in the eyes,

362
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:31,981
as if to say,
"Mr. Peppino, shall we dance"?

363
00:26:32,295 --> 00:26:35,321
I understood right away.
I said neither yes nor no.

364
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:36,621
I got up,

365
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,993
with a certain gesture,
I went before her

366
00:26:40,825 --> 00:26:44,156
and I magnetized her with one look.
She rose up, like that.

367
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,184
I put an arm around her waist..
- And you clasped her.

368
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:50,762
Easy.
And then we began dancing.

369
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:56,990
In the middle of it.. you know
when you start to shake.. - From cold.

370
00:26:57,552 --> 00:26:59,764
From emotion.
- Of course.

371
00:27:00,194 --> 00:27:01,697
African?
- Almost.

372
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,639
Yet, I trembled.

373
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,859
In conclusion,..

374
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:08,796
we were close,

375
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:12,603
the warmth, cheek to cheek, eye to eye..

376
00:27:12,821 --> 00:27:14,123
Tooth to tooth.

377
00:27:15,412 --> 00:27:16,617
Almost.

378
00:27:17,391 --> 00:27:18,451
So, she..

379
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,060
She collapsed.

380
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:23,149
Then I..
"What do I do?"

381
00:27:24,652 --> 00:27:25,992
I threw myself.

382
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,124
What a kiss!

383
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:30,406
Just imagine the kiss!

384
00:27:31,555 --> 00:27:32,838
Bravo Peppino!

385
00:27:33,117 --> 00:27:35,866
What did I always tell you?
"Go on. Go on!"

386
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,679
And the girlfriend?
- I don't like the girlfriend.

387
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,926
I mean, was she there too?

388
00:27:42,591 --> 00:27:44,891
She was on the phone in the hallway.

389
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:47,480
And.. her?

390
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:51,536
She remained a little.. dizzy, y'know..

391
00:27:52,307 --> 00:27:55,723
Then she left as if to say,
"It's better if I go."

392
00:27:56,298 --> 00:27:57,371
And you?

393
00:27:58,207 --> 00:27:59,277
I..

394
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,426
I left too.

395
00:28:03,687 --> 00:28:05,771
And when do you see her again?

396
00:28:06,888 --> 00:28:10,437
I don't know. They invited me
in the evening. Maybe I'll go.

397
00:28:10,507 --> 00:28:13,357
You know what?
Let her wait two or three days.

398
00:28:14,002 --> 00:28:16,598
You think so?
- It's better.

399
00:28:17,205 --> 00:28:18,215
How come?

400
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:29,669
Peppino, you get it?
- I get it. And then?

401
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:32,263
I'm afraid to hurt her.

402
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:34,789
Is she sensitive?
- Too much so.

403
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:38,574
Then I'll give you such a scalp rub
that it'll shock you and her.

404
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:45,986
Mr. Peppino, it's done.
- Good, young man. For you.

405
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:48,256
Thank the gentleman.
- Thank you.

406
00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:50,474
Goodbye.
- Bye.

407
00:28:53,171 --> 00:28:57,655
Young lady, don't you recognize me?
- How could I? You look like a puppet.

408
00:28:58,672 --> 00:29:00,736
But a pleasing puppet, right?

409
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,589
You stink, what's in your hair?
- ''Spring''.

410
00:29:04,754 --> 00:29:08,571
It sucks. Aren't you ashamed at
your age? Where's your wisdom?

411
00:29:09,137 --> 00:29:11,989
Listen, Elide, why do we
always have to fight?

412
00:29:12,472 --> 00:29:14,963
Wouldn't it be nice to be friends?

413
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:18,131
I know you, you won't charm me again.

414
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:23,259
I don't want to charm you. It'd be so nice
to go together, mornings, afternoons,

415
00:29:23,432 --> 00:29:24,732
in the evening..

416
00:29:25,878 --> 00:29:27,440
How sensitive!

417
00:29:27,908 --> 00:29:30,142
Would you like to go to the movies?

418
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:32,015
Yes, I would.

419
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:35,071
Wanna go?
They're showing a good movie today.

420
00:29:35,193 --> 00:29:38,096
Yes? Which one?
- ''Love and Torment".

421
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:41,050
It must be nice, right?
- Very.

422
00:29:41,284 --> 00:29:44,560
Wanna go?
But, alone or with company?

423
00:29:45,507 --> 00:29:47,207
Well, with company.

424
00:29:47,884 --> 00:29:52,220
With a handsome young man?
Hmm? Wanna go? Yes?

425
00:29:52,928 --> 00:29:55,699
Merlino, bring her to the movies,
I've stuff to do.

426
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,765
Bring that!

427
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,517
We rule, Peppi! We rule!

428
00:30:11,164 --> 00:30:12,250
Who is it?

429
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,088
<i>Friends.</i>

430
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,612
Which friends?

431
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:17,484
<i>Peppino.</i>

432
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,893
I'm not dressed.. one moment.
What do you want?

433
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:31,103
<i>Sorry, maybe I'm mistaken.
I'm looking for Mrs. Olga and Miss Elsa.</i>

434
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:33,622
Ah! It's Mr. Peppino, a friend of ours.

435
00:30:33,692 --> 00:30:36,392
Giorgio, open it,
I'm going to make coffee.

436
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,197
Good evening. Come in. Please.

437
00:30:46,688 --> 00:30:50,038
And the ladies?
- They're in there, they'll be out soon.

438
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:52,884
You're the one not dressed?
- Yes, Giorgio Raggi.

439
00:30:52,954 --> 00:30:56,557
We have to be careful, right?
Come in! Give me your hat.

440
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:03,741
I play tennis.
- Well done. - Thank you.

441
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:09,438
If it fell on the ground..
It's brand new. - Yeah?

442
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:13,267
100? - 160.
- 160? - Yes, but it's a friend.

443
00:31:13,432 --> 00:31:14,782
No ration points.

444
00:31:19,307 --> 00:31:21,888
Soccer player!
- With the hands. Roojby

445
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,747
Please, come in.

446
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:25,482
This is another game.

447
00:31:26,036 --> 00:31:29,863
Only you were missing.
Yes, it's a very interesting evening.

448
00:31:31,213 --> 00:31:32,789
Eight!
- Come in!

449
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,039
They're all friends.

450
00:31:35,234 --> 00:31:37,634
No introductions, they waste time.

451
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:41,520
A good friend.
- Good evening. - Evening.

452
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,155
<i>I should've been a cardsharp.</i>
- Here you go. Have a seat.

453
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:48,840
And Miss Elsa?
- She's making coffee with Olga.

454
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,468
Please make room.

455
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:56,474
Good luck, eh!
<i>- Would you give me four of 50?</i>

456
00:31:56,544 --> 00:31:58,494
What a jinx! When it starts..

457
00:32:00,484 --> 00:32:02,034
<i>Gentlemen, your bets.</i>

458
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,180
<i>1,000 on the bank.</i>

459
00:32:09,045 --> 00:32:10,595
Your bets, gentlemen.

460
00:32:12,004 --> 00:32:13,906
<i>Thank you, 1,000 first.</i>

461
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:15,619
How much? Three is OK?

462
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:17,516
Excuse me, sir. Sir!

463
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,567
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
How much? Three?

464
00:32:21,913 --> 00:32:24,169
Huh? I don't..
- Is it three?

465
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,290
You want five?
OK, here's five.

466
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:34,168
Five cards, eh?
You play boldly!

467
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:37,430
Well then?
- Well then?

468
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:41,602
Then, not for mistrust, but it's
the rule of the house. You pay upfront.

469
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,664
You pay upfront: 5000 lire.

470
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:46,039
Gentlemen, you may bet. It's on.

471
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:51,071
Please, Leila, some chocolates?
- Yes, they bring good luck.

472
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,101
There you go.
- Thank you.

473
00:32:55,155 --> 00:32:58,909
You should never had him come.
- Come on, they won't rob him.

474
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:01,889
Moreover, they are good people.
- Not so much.

475
00:33:02,141 --> 00:33:04,120
Fishmongers are rich, you know.

476
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:06,924
Well, I'm tired!
Tired of this life.

477
00:33:06,994 --> 00:33:09,781
What would you do, tell me?
You won't take a lover.

478
00:33:09,851 --> 00:33:13,458
you still think of that guy who left
you nothing. One has to live, no?

479
00:33:13,672 --> 00:33:15,682
Gentlemen, the game is on.

480
00:33:15,752 --> 00:33:19,084
<i>Can I bet 2000 on the bank?
- Fine. 2000 lire.</i>

481
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:21,823
God forbid!

482
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,727
You take them.
If I touch them, I jinx myself.

483
00:33:27,243 --> 00:33:28,750
Why always me?

484
00:33:28,938 --> 00:33:32,838
Yes, it's the third time you had 9.
- Go on, you got a lucky hand!

485
00:33:37,602 --> 00:33:40,052
Shall we?
- Go on, take the cards.

486
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:46,141
Cross the cards! Cross them!
- Cross them.

487
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,956
Well, do you want cards? Yes or no?

488
00:33:52,112 --> 00:33:53,425
Yes.
- No!

489
00:33:53,858 --> 00:33:56,010
Don't touch them!
- Who's touching?

490
00:33:56,696 --> 00:33:57,727
Eight!

491
00:33:58,385 --> 00:34:00,535
Nine!
- You drew on seven, eh?

492
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:05,238
Did I do something wrong?
- Heavens, no! You're a phenomenon.

493
00:34:05,308 --> 00:34:09,138
He's right. You have a lucky hand.
- A miracle of intuition! A miracle!

494
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:12,177
But it's not allowed. He drew on seven.
- It is allowed!

495
00:34:12,247 --> 00:34:16,233
At Monte Carlo, a Turk drew on a nine.
- But the Turks are extraordinary.

496
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:19,277
It's you who are extraordinary!
A phenomenon, I say!

497
00:34:19,347 --> 00:34:22,270
So then, do we want to play?
- He's an ace!

498
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:24,347
Mr. Peppino is such a wag.

499
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:27,784
He likes baccarat a lot.
- And you like chocolate.

500
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:31,138
That's a good one!
- It's the chocolate that's good.

501
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:35,428
How are you?
- Elsa is coming with the coffee.

502
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,041
Mr. Peppino, how much will you bet?
- One moment.

503
00:34:38,111 --> 00:34:39,811
Want me to play for you?

504
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,610
Yes.
- Here she is.

505
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,559
Good evening.

506
00:34:47,134 --> 00:34:49,484
Excuse me, if I took the liberty to..

507
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,286
This is for you.
- Thank you.

508
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:56,273
You know, Elsa, he's been very lucky?
- Congratulations!

509
00:34:56,431 --> 00:34:58,832
I didn't mean to do it.
<i>- Mr. Peppino!</i>

510
00:34:58,902 --> 00:35:01,349
<i>We're losing all.</i>
- Eh.. it doesn't matter.

511
00:35:01,419 --> 00:35:03,536
<i>Come here yourself!</i>
- One moment.

512
00:35:03,606 --> 00:35:06,185
<i>Shall we start the table?</i>
- As you wish.

513
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:09,182
But, if you're so lucky,
why don't you play?

514
00:35:09,391 --> 00:35:11,300
I wish I'd lose.
- Why?

515
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:14,319
It's because of the proverb..

516
00:35:15,237 --> 00:35:17,186
And then I didn't come to play.

517
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:21,356
Excuse me, but the maid is away, and..
I left something in the kitchen.

518
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:26,041
<i>Damn, what bad luck!</i>

519
00:35:26,853 --> 00:35:29,275
<i>Will you come here!</i>
- I'm coming.

520
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:46,424
It's hopeless. Since that idiot left,
I had nothing but bad luck.

521
00:35:55,628 --> 00:35:57,339
Don't let anyone out!

522
00:36:06,578 --> 00:36:08,054
What's going on?

523
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,824
Eh, one knew that one day or
the other it would end up this way!

524
00:36:16,548 --> 00:36:17,648
Two o'clock.

525
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:19,501
Where you going?

526
00:36:19,926 --> 00:36:21,063
It's late.

527
00:36:22,405 --> 00:36:24,094
We're leaving together.

528
00:36:30,116 --> 00:36:31,292
Get in.

529
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,760
Go on.

530
00:36:40,918 --> 00:36:42,175
What a dump!

531
00:36:45,352 --> 00:36:48,098
What a perfume! We're settled!

532
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,310
Tomorrow morning, we'll all be out.

533
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:05,078
It's not a mistake?
- Oh, no.

534
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,404
We deserve this?
- We were gambling.

535
00:37:14,996 --> 00:37:19,096
Then we won't get out tomorrow.
- Yes, we'll wait for the Commissioner.

536
00:37:23,245 --> 00:37:26,999
You feel like crying, huh?
- Me? No, for goodness sake.

537
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,581
Gambling is gambling.

538
00:37:34,315 --> 00:37:35,410
Thank you.

539
00:37:38,942 --> 00:37:42,451
And Miss Elsa?
- She's in the women's ward.

540
00:37:43,182 --> 00:37:45,532
Well, for her it's a different story.

541
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:49,588
But Olga.. She's sly.
The house is not in her name.

542
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:54,387
Oh, it's Elsa's?
- No, it's a rented flat.

543
00:37:54,628 --> 00:37:56,024
But in her name.

544
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:57,368
But..

545
00:37:58,327 --> 00:37:59,833
with a good lawyer..

546
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:02,137
Who knows!

547
00:38:11,713 --> 00:38:15,192
Are you really sure he wasn't there?
- I'm positive.

548
00:38:16,009 --> 00:38:19,809
I even went to where he buys his fish,
but they haven't seen him.

549
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,145
What do you think?

550
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:25,064
What do I know? I even sent Merlino to
his home to see if he was sick, but nil.

551
00:38:25,162 --> 00:38:28,484
Sick? He's probably asleep
and didn't wake up. - How come?

552
00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:32,204
Well, he had a certain invitation,
and probably returned late.

553
00:38:32,765 --> 00:38:34,265
The same lady, eh?

554
00:38:34,763 --> 00:38:39,197
If I had a stall next to yours,
I wouldn't search too far for her.

555
00:38:39,394 --> 00:38:41,775
Like I care! He can do what he wants.

556
00:38:41,938 --> 00:38:44,124
Hey! Miss Elide!
- MerlÃ¬!

557
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,652
Well? - Even the porter was angry.
- And Peppino?

558
00:38:47,722 --> 00:38:51,341
I knocked and knocked,
then he said he hasn't come home.

559
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,978
Maybe he had an accident?
- Let's check the hospital or police.

560
00:38:55,048 --> 00:38:58,715
Forget hospital, police or accident!
It's all my fault.

561
00:38:58,876 --> 00:39:02,625
I should've never given him that scalp rub.
- What's that got to do with it?

562
00:39:02,695 --> 00:39:07,250
Yes. For, when one wants to live that way,
one needs to have gone through storms!

563
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,871
And to know the ropes.

564
00:39:08,941 --> 00:39:11,855
I wouldn't seek that far,
with a stall next to yours.

565
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:14,587
Lambchop, what whining!
You're boring!

566
00:39:14,657 --> 00:39:18,769
Merli, is Peppino here?
- The boss isn't here. No sale today.

567
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:22,076
Why aren't you selling today?
What is this novelty?

568
00:39:22,146 --> 00:39:25,527
There's just some for frying.
- So? You want some for frying?

569
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:29,447
Is it fresh? - Of course it's fresh,
it just arrived! Come on now.

570
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:33,620
How good you are.
You're all heart.

571
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:39,178
Shall I expect you for the permanent?
- AurÃ¨, I have no wish for a perm.

572
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,569
Elide!
What did I tell you?

573
00:39:43,432 --> 00:39:44,758
Look who's coming!

574
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,140
Well, how goes it?

575
00:39:59,035 --> 00:40:00,976
Well? Haven't you seen me before?

576
00:40:01,046 --> 00:40:03,193
We wanted to go to the police!

577
00:40:04,303 --> 00:40:05,653
What do you mean?

578
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:08,852
We were worried.
You've never done that.

579
00:40:08,922 --> 00:40:10,503
You were worried.

580
00:40:10,972 --> 00:40:13,156
We wanted to go to the hospital too!

581
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,845
What's with this hospital, police..?

582
00:40:16,552 --> 00:40:17,756
What's with you?

583
00:40:17,826 --> 00:40:21,464
We're asking you!
You think it's fair to keep us so worried?

584
00:40:22,695 --> 00:40:24,054
What am I, a kid?

585
00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:29,088
Nothing happened to me.
Nothing at all.

586
00:40:32,537 --> 00:40:34,337
Let's go get an espresso.

587
00:40:35,027 --> 00:40:38,945
Go put the stuff in the storehouse
and then you're free. - OK.

588
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,773
What a big jerk!

589
00:40:45,348 --> 00:40:48,660
Speak! I'm dying of curiosity.
- There's nothing to tell.

590
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:52,701
You're out all night, you return with
that face, and got nothing to tell?

591
00:40:52,771 --> 00:40:56,743
Alright, I was there.
- You were there, but.. How did it go?

592
00:40:57,438 --> 00:41:00,077
Fine.
It couldn't have been better.

593
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,750
And that's all you're telling me?

594
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,220
Two espressos.
<i>- Coming up.</i>

595
00:41:07,613 --> 00:41:09,784
I want to know.. what..
- AurÃ¨!

596
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,628
It's simple: dinner, records, dancing..

597
00:41:14,193 --> 00:41:16,471
At a certain point, I wanted to leave..

598
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:18,645
and I was held back.

599
00:41:19,805 --> 00:41:20,863
I see!

600
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,213
Peppino, you know what's new?

601
00:41:24,886 --> 00:41:26,584
You've got a crush.

602
00:41:27,222 --> 00:41:30,480
You can't do without her,
and you'll go back.

603
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:34,854
No, not today.
Indeed..

604
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:42,590
Say, do you know some lawyer?
- A lawyer?

605
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:47,293
Mama Mia! What did you do?
Why? A lawyer? What happened?

606
00:41:48,035 --> 00:41:50,767
That's it, see, I knew you'd say that!

607
00:41:51,748 --> 00:41:53,048
You fell for it.

608
00:42:26,381 --> 00:42:31,075
Forgive me if I took the liberty to..
But, since I found out from..

609
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:35,298
I thought I'd visit you.
- Thank you.

610
00:42:35,907 --> 00:42:39,479
The others were released immediately,
didn't they tell you? - No.

611
00:42:40,037 --> 00:42:42,008
Didn't they come to see you?

612
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,299
Not even Mrs. Olga?
- Not even her.

613
00:42:55,558 --> 00:43:00,892
I would've come earlier, but only
yesterday the attorney got permission..

614
00:43:01,014 --> 00:43:04,444
He told me that
you'll be released in a few days.

615
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:11,452
In the end, I was the luckiest of all.
I got out first.

616
00:43:11,685 --> 00:43:14,149
You must forgive me if, for my fault,..

617
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:16,452
Heavens, what are you saying?

618
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:19,334
For me, it was..
like an entertainment.

619
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:24,189
How good you are!
- It doesn't take much to be good with you.

620
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:28,098
But if you only knew how
much bad they've done me.

621
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:33,771
If it weren't for him.
Poor little one!

622
00:43:36,191 --> 00:43:37,193
A child?

623
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:41,349
Yes.

624
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:49,204
And.. is he with his father?

625
00:43:51,387 --> 00:43:53,887
No, I no longer know anything about him.

626
00:43:54,521 --> 00:43:57,782
He left for Milan because of..
financial trouble.

627
00:43:58,571 --> 00:44:02,503
For a few months he wrote me,
also sending something for the baby.

628
00:44:03,256 --> 00:44:05,746
But then, that too came to an end.

629
00:44:07,165 --> 00:44:08,900
So I was alone in Rome.

630
00:44:10,755 --> 00:44:12,953
I happened to meet Olga, and..

631
00:44:13,843 --> 00:44:14,976
the rest..

632
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:17,266
you can imagine.

633
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:23,195
And the child.. where is he?

634
00:44:23,515 --> 00:44:25,877
In Abruzzo. With a good woman.

635
00:44:26,202 --> 00:44:29,552
Indeed, I wrote her that
I'd go see him within the week.

636
00:44:30,383 --> 00:44:31,489
But now..

637
00:44:32,676 --> 00:44:33,926
Who knows when?

638
00:44:34,233 --> 00:44:38,750
You want me to go? When I return
I can give you news about the child.

639
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,588
I really like children.

640
00:44:41,528 --> 00:44:43,666
Write down the address here.

641
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:51,147
You won't tell that woman that I..
- Mrs. Elsa, are we kidding?

642
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,146
I'll tell her that..

643
00:44:54,063 --> 00:44:55,313
Leave it to me.

644
00:45:03,503 --> 00:45:05,858
Bianchini, we have to go.

645
00:45:12,263 --> 00:45:13,427
Thank you.

646
00:45:35,377 --> 00:45:36,977
What's the kid's name?

647
00:45:37,616 --> 00:45:38,711
Carletto.

648
00:45:44,229 --> 00:45:46,428
<i>Carletto!</i>

649
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,703
<i>Carletto!</i>

650
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:00,502
Carletto!

651
00:46:25,378 --> 00:46:27,460
<i>Carletto!</i>

652
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,228
<i>Carletto! Carletto! Carletto!</i>

653
00:46:38,108 --> 00:46:40,165
<i>Carletto, where are you hiding?</i>

654
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:43,732
<i>Oh, finally!</i>

655
00:46:45,338 --> 00:46:48,335
I've been calling you for an hour.
Why didn't you answer?

656
00:46:48,612 --> 00:46:51,302
Come!
Come and see who's here.

657
00:46:53,823 --> 00:46:55,781
Look what a big boy he's become!

658
00:46:55,851 --> 00:46:59,601
You put them into the world and
don't expect them to grow like that.

659
00:47:00,511 --> 00:47:02,682
Yeah. You don't expect it.

660
00:47:02,968 --> 00:47:05,225
Feel, feel how much he weighs.

661
00:47:06,146 --> 00:47:07,748
Oh, my goodness!

662
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,722
Wow, how much you weigh!

663
00:47:16,977 --> 00:47:19,406
Yes, yes. Be good. Be good.

664
00:47:19,598 --> 00:47:22,227
My husband's father.
He's a bit touched.

665
00:47:22,434 --> 00:47:26,392
Carletto, don't act like that!
If you knew who this gentleman is!

666
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:32,149
I prepared everything: t-shirts,
woolen socks.. I couldn't find one.

667
00:47:32,246 --> 00:47:36,155
Shall I put the coat in?
- No, it's cold, he'd better wear it.

668
00:47:36,225 --> 00:47:38,994
THE TRUMPET!!!!

669
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,865
He wants the trumpet, it's his passion.
Teresa, go fetch it.

670
00:47:46,895 --> 00:47:50,511
Here is the milk! It's still warm.
- Yes, that's fine.

671
00:47:50,724 --> 00:47:54,324
You'd better bring some milk.
He may get hungry on the train.

672
00:47:54,691 --> 00:47:57,820
Why, is he leaving?
- With you, right? - With me?

673
00:47:57,934 --> 00:48:01,429
We wrote it in the letter.
Teresa and I are leaving tomorrow.

674
00:48:01,499 --> 00:48:04,058
My husband was drafted
and we go to work in a shop.

675
00:48:04,128 --> 00:48:06,191
THE TRUMPET!!!!

676
00:48:07,641 --> 00:48:09,152
Here's the trumpet.

677
00:48:09,702 --> 00:48:11,502
Didn't you get the letter?

678
00:48:12,024 --> 00:48:14,696
Oh, yeah. I forgot. How stupid of me.

679
00:48:15,001 --> 00:48:17,363
I thought it was for another month..

680
00:48:19,303 --> 00:48:20,930
Carletto, let's go.

681
00:48:21,528 --> 00:48:23,983
It makes me sad, I love him so much.

682
00:48:24,885 --> 00:48:27,319
Now you put your coat on, Carletto.

683
00:48:27,932 --> 00:48:31,279
Come, Teresa, let's go.
Excuse us, we'll be right back.

684
00:48:43,198 --> 00:48:48,069
What's with him? - Since you haven't
recognized your child, he's cussing at you.

685
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:51,225
You hear?
You must pity him, he has a bad temper.

686
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:54,838
You see him now. But when young,
with a punch he could flatten a bull.

687
00:48:54,908 --> 00:48:57,609
<i>Giovanni!</i>
- Coming. Excuse me. Here I am!

688
00:49:51,373 --> 00:49:53,100
What a mess!

689
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,878
What a mess!

690
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:39,430
What a scare you got!

691
00:51:46,344 --> 00:51:48,044
Watch out, you can fall.

692
00:51:49,164 --> 00:51:51,488
Be careful, eh?
See the sunshine?

693
00:51:54,606 --> 00:51:56,345
Give me the trumpet.
- No.

694
00:51:56,415 --> 00:51:58,920
Give it. - No!
- Give it to me.

695
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,317
Watch it, you can hurt yourself.
- No!

696
00:52:01,387 --> 00:52:03,784
You stupid!
- What? Am I stupid?

697
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:06,165
I'm a stupid?

698
00:52:06,322 --> 00:52:10,472
What are you, crazy? - But who made
this trumpet? - Are you crazy? Darn!

699
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:12,964
Give it to me, come on!
- Damn it!

700
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:15,230
Who made this trumpet?

701
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:24,363
Later. I'll give you something else.
A nice thing. You want it?

702
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:26,413
Gimme.
- No.

703
00:52:26,696 --> 00:52:28,446
Gimme.
- I'll give you..

704
00:52:28,954 --> 00:52:30,624
What can I give you?

705
00:52:30,824 --> 00:52:31,974
Are you nuts?

706
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,981
Some chocolates!
You like chocolates?

707
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:38,830
Chocklits!
- Chocolates? - Gimme.

708
00:52:39,192 --> 00:52:41,531
But you mustnÂt play anymore.

709
00:52:46,237 --> 00:52:47,938
They must be here.

710
00:52:51,032 --> 00:52:54,773
It'd be just great if I couldn't find it.
Look at this mess!

711
00:52:57,861 --> 00:53:00,000
Seek and ye shall not find.

712
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:03,265
Under my eyes for three months,
now that I seek it I can't find it.

713
00:53:03,335 --> 00:53:05,434
It's probably on the ground.

714
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,581
It must be lost.

715
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,298
And now?
- And now?

716
00:53:10,503 --> 00:53:13,740
I must find it. It must be here.
Where did it go?

717
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:19,510
Here it is. It was inside
this sock. Here it is!

718
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:23,110
Gimme!
- Will you give me a chuckle, eh?

719
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:26,217
No fingers in the nose!

720
00:53:29,077 --> 00:53:30,526
Come and get it!

721
00:53:31,777 --> 00:53:33,946
I'm coming and getting it!

722
00:54:10,977 --> 00:54:12,046
No more.

723
00:54:18,652 --> 00:54:20,429
No more.. Ow!

724
00:54:20,499 --> 00:54:23,834
I'll make you a hole,
I'll make a hole in your belly!

725
00:54:24,046 --> 00:54:25,290
Hold still!

726
00:54:27,835 --> 00:54:29,035
Here, you see?

727
00:54:30,222 --> 00:54:31,618
Gimme.

728
00:54:35,462 --> 00:54:38,045
Who can it be?
- Who knows?

729
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:39,659
Who cares?

730
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:43,284
Who cares?
- Here. Here it is!

731
00:54:45,636 --> 00:54:48,679
Did you get it?
- Here it is.

732
00:54:49,549 --> 00:54:52,117
You be good and I'll see who it is.

733
00:54:52,187 --> 00:54:54,600
Keep sitting just like that.

734
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,636
Just like that.

735
00:54:58,393 --> 00:55:00,893
I'll be back soon.
- Gimme dat trumpet!

736
00:55:02,864 --> 00:55:06,100
Starting that again?
Just be good.

737
00:55:10,136 --> 00:55:13,895
Be good. Act like a little gentleman.
Let me see the gentleman.

738
00:55:16,482 --> 00:55:17,666
I'll be...

739
00:55:22,382 --> 00:55:23,583
I'm coming.

740
00:55:24,969 --> 00:55:26,704
Who is it?
<i>- Open up!</i>

741
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:30,258
But, who is it?
<i>- Come on, make no fuss!</i>

742
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:31,511
<i>Less chatter!</i>

743
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:33,570
Here I am, excuse me.

744
00:55:34,263 --> 00:55:36,705
Excuse me, lives here, Mr..

745
00:55:38,233 --> 00:55:41,274
You're always joking!
- You fell for it, didn't you?

746
00:55:41,719 --> 00:55:44,316
You have a guilty conscience, young man.

747
00:55:44,584 --> 00:55:46,957
Tell me the truth: Scared, huh?

748
00:55:47,891 --> 00:55:50,483
How are you?
- Fine. I came to see you.

749
00:55:50,651 --> 00:55:54,138
Late last night you weren't there.
You've become a mystery man.

750
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:56,071
You sneak about, we don't see you.

751
00:55:56,141 --> 00:55:58,591
But I'm an old friend, I've the right..

752
00:55:58,778 --> 00:56:02,528
You're right, but you know how it is,
one has stuff to do, and..

753
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:05,985
I'm in a hurry.
- Then, you won't ask me in?

754
00:56:06,173 --> 00:56:09,309
Where? I have to get dressed
and go to the market.

755
00:56:09,483 --> 00:56:12,449
What's this? - A trumpet.
- What are you doing with it?

756
00:56:12,874 --> 00:56:15,070
I'm studying music.

757
00:56:16,092 --> 00:56:18,870
The trumpet?
- It's a musical instrument, isn't it?

758
00:56:20,569 --> 00:56:22,384
Be honest, I'm interrupting.

759
00:56:22,714 --> 00:56:23,870
You got it.

760
00:56:24,439 --> 00:56:26,000
Well, blow me down!

761
00:56:26,638 --> 00:56:30,193
Who is it? That girl?
- Another one. - Another!

762
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,536
Hot damn!

763
00:56:32,192 --> 00:56:33,542
Is she beautiful?

764
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:38,439
Let me take a peek..

765
00:56:38,509 --> 00:56:39,750
<i>THE TRUMPET!!!</i>

766
00:56:44,344 --> 00:56:46,651
Is she young?
- Yeah.. you see..

767
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:52,098
Ah! Peppi!
- Ah, Aurelio, see you later.

768
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:55,153
What did he do?

769
00:56:56,429 --> 00:57:00,963
Hey! What did you do?
You broke the vase? Eh? Are you crazy?

770
00:57:01,123 --> 00:57:02,161
Tell me!

771
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:06,629
You broke it!
- Me? I broke the vase?

772
00:57:06,911 --> 00:57:09,381
You slap me and tell me lies?

773
00:57:11,281 --> 00:57:12,826
What have you done?

774
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:17,071
Here's what happened:
I'll have to post an ad.

775
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:23,070
"Whoever lost baby on tram please
retrieve him at Piazza Cancelleria 3".

776
00:57:23,212 --> 00:57:24,282
Come on!

777
00:57:26,585 --> 00:57:31,026
Yes, that's right. You know
what it's like on a tram? - What?

778
00:57:31,096 --> 00:57:34,313
The tickets, the confusion,
the conversation..

779
00:57:34,383 --> 00:57:37,821
What conversation? - Why?
There's no conversation on the tram?

780
00:57:37,891 --> 00:57:40,509
Fine, there is.
- You act like I was lying.

781
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:44,987
A shove and suddenly, you look:
you have a child in your arms.

782
00:57:45,057 --> 00:57:49,230
In your arms? On the bus?
- Why? That never happened to you?

783
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,250
Not me.
- Well, it has to me.

784
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,449
Then after the push,
I got off, in the dark..

785
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:56,791
It was dark?
On the bus?

786
00:57:56,947 --> 00:58:00,281
No, when I got off. There's no light.
Wartime blackout.

787
00:58:00,515 --> 00:58:02,998
"Is this your child?"
- No. - "No".

788
00:58:03,128 --> 00:58:06,540
What do I do, throw it away? A child?
- So you kept him.

789
00:58:07,767 --> 00:58:08,930
There he is.

790
00:58:11,106 --> 00:58:13,830
Here he is. - Here he is.
- The trumpet.

791
00:58:14,278 --> 00:58:15,700
He's never still.

792
00:58:15,922 --> 00:58:19,780
You know my personality,
I can't stand kids.

793
00:58:20,399 --> 00:58:21,835
But he's cute, eh?

794
00:58:26,776 --> 00:58:28,306
How.. how rude!

795
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,798
Lambchop, to get too close is dangerous.

796
00:58:33,185 --> 00:58:34,997
He has some slap in him!

797
00:58:35,148 --> 00:58:36,774
Two slaps!

798
00:58:41,989 --> 00:58:43,639
Whose baby could he be?

799
00:58:43,899 --> 00:58:46,803
Well.. who knows?

800
00:58:47,701 --> 00:58:49,425
Tomorrow, we'll see.

801
00:58:50,362 --> 00:58:52,113
Yeah, let me tell you..

802
00:58:52,974 --> 00:58:56,658
Nowadays, anything can happen.

803
00:58:58,277 --> 00:59:00,166
Did he sleep here?
- Yes.

804
00:59:00,617 --> 00:59:01,686
Yes.

805
00:59:01,822 --> 00:59:03,822
And this was your idea, right?

806
00:59:04,234 --> 00:59:06,124
I had to, as you can see.

807
00:59:06,782 --> 00:59:10,582
And you'll bring him with you?
- Of course. Do I leave him alone?

808
00:59:12,525 --> 00:59:14,741
But first I'd like to give him a bath.

809
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,128
Yes. Let's give him a bath.

810
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,246
Let's.

811
00:59:19,604 --> 00:59:21,243
Fine. Give me a hand.

812
00:59:21,409 --> 00:59:23,963
No, give me a hand to bathe him.
- Is there gas?

813
00:59:24,033 --> 00:59:25,439
Yes, but we need..

814
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:29,230
We need to do it right away
or there won't be any left. Come!

815
00:59:29,373 --> 00:59:33,164
What do we do?
- Put the water in the pot.

816
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:36,136
What's the water like?
- Rotten.

817
00:59:38,987 --> 00:59:41,802
Damn, it's cold.
- That's why we'll heat it up.

818
00:59:41,872 --> 00:59:43,168
Stupids!

819
00:59:44,194 --> 00:59:47,218
What do you have against us?
- Your brains.

820
00:59:47,502 --> 00:59:48,590
Oh, well..

821
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:52,578
At most, it'll boil in 15 minutes.

822
00:59:53,404 --> 00:59:57,390
I said 15 minutes, instead it took
less than an hour and a half.

823
00:59:57,613 --> 00:59:59,308
It's boiling!

824
00:59:59,409 --> 01:00:00,809
Get the spaghetti!

825
01:00:04,443 --> 01:00:05,701
Damn it!

826
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,870
Here we are.
It's ready. Ready.

827
01:00:14,206 --> 01:00:16,346
They're draining!

828
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:20,510
And now, Carletto,
we'll give you a little bath.

829
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:24,783
Ah, so you even know his name?
- Yes. He told me himself.

830
01:00:24,853 --> 01:00:29,465
Which he? The driver of the tram?
- No, him, Carletto.

831
01:00:30,594 --> 01:00:33,815
If you can't believe a child,
then it's the end of the world.

832
01:00:33,885 --> 01:00:35,230
And the soap?

833
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:36,626
Beats me.

834
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:39,535
We'll try a substitute.

835
01:00:40,851 --> 01:00:43,221
What are you doing?
- I'll give him a shave.

836
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:45,436
If you don't mind, this is my field.

837
01:00:45,506 --> 01:00:47,849
Now then, we'll put this here.

838
01:00:49,077 --> 01:00:53,492
What a nice almond scented bath!

839
01:00:53,829 --> 01:00:55,863
Peppino, smell this perfume.

840
01:00:56,807 --> 01:00:58,994
Here, Carletto, over here!

841
01:00:59,116 --> 01:01:03,287
Turn over! And we'll do the bottom, too!

842
01:01:06,801 --> 01:01:09,301
We'll even shave him against the growth.

843
01:01:11,942 --> 01:01:14,722
Be careful of the pimples!

844
01:01:22,552 --> 01:01:25,291
Dry him well.
Be good!

845
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:29,304
Get the talcum powder.
- What talcum powder? I've some flour..

846
01:01:29,374 --> 01:01:32,264
Well, get it, it's all the same.
Hurry.

847
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:37,194
See how we treat you?
With white flour.

848
01:01:39,189 --> 01:01:42,350
Peppi! You have a little oil?
We'll fry him!

849
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:45,994
Close your eyes! Close your eyes!

850
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:50,856
It's late, I got to go.
If you're quick, I'll wait.

851
01:01:51,725 --> 01:01:55,521
I have stuff to do. - What?
You said you were going to the market.

852
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:59,191
Well.. I have to get dressed
and give the baby to the porter.

853
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:00,740
Why the porter?

854
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:03,736
Did you really believe
I found him on the tram?

855
01:02:03,806 --> 01:02:06,134
Ah, Lambchop!
- My name is Aurelio.

856
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:08,690
My name is Aurelio.
- No! - Yes! - No!

857
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,083
Both of you stink.

858
01:02:11,012 --> 01:02:12,694
You're nice instead!
Say!

859
01:02:12,764 --> 01:02:16,787
If you see Merlino,
tell him to put my stall out. - OK.

860
01:02:17,285 --> 01:02:18,449
How cute!

861
01:02:25,315 --> 01:02:26,469
Mrs. PÃ¨!

862
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:29,410
Mrs. Peppa!

863
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:33,478
<i>Yeah, what do you want?</i>
- Please, come down for a minute.

864
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,779
<i>What is it? What's the matter?</i>

865
01:02:37,284 --> 01:02:39,881
Nothing. I want you to see..

866
01:02:40,428 --> 01:02:43,455
to see.
I want you to see some business.

867
01:02:43,525 --> 01:02:46,139
<i>OK, I'm coming down.</i>
- Thank you.

868
01:02:50,314 --> 01:02:51,511
Can I fill it?

869
01:02:51,581 --> 01:02:55,829
All like that! They fill, and my bucket is
never filled. I've been here a half hour!

870
01:02:55,899 --> 01:02:59,975
It's two hours! How long does it take?
- Everybody does what they like.

871
01:03:00,045 --> 01:03:02,013
Come on, for a drop of water!

872
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:04,202
See, they get angry as well.

873
01:03:04,429 --> 01:03:07,670
Get out of here!
- Like it's killing you!

874
01:03:08,094 --> 01:03:10,097
Even the kids don't respect you.

875
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:15,450
But.. - Quiet! You were here first, why
didn't you fill the bucket? Why? Come on!

876
01:03:15,597 --> 01:03:18,519
You were here first, that's it!
They wait!

877
01:03:19,032 --> 01:03:22,173
Me, as well, Mr. PeppÃ¬n?
- For you, it's different.

878
01:03:22,243 --> 01:03:25,722
After her, nobody else, got it?
- Got it.

879
01:03:25,792 --> 01:03:29,857
What do you get? Get the tray of fish,
and we'll wash them here.

880
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,139
Does your lady know
that you eat her apples?

881
01:03:34,209 --> 01:03:36,904
This one she gave to me.
Want a little bite?

882
01:03:36,974 --> 01:03:38,087
After you.

883
01:03:40,574 --> 01:03:42,251
No, where you bit it.

884
01:03:45,746 --> 01:03:47,633
What manners!
What's with you?

885
01:03:47,703 --> 01:03:50,739
The fountains are made for water,
not for chitchat.

886
01:03:50,809 --> 01:03:54,559
I had to wash the apple.
- Don't wash it, it's tastier that way.

887
01:03:54,629 --> 01:03:57,882
But, ma'am!
- What "ma'am", I'm a "miss".

888
01:03:58,054 --> 01:04:00,955
Go home instead of
staying here like an idiot!

889
01:04:01,475 --> 01:04:03,203
"A little bite"!

890
01:04:03,677 --> 01:04:05,754
I'll give you a little bite.

891
01:04:05,824 --> 01:04:09,615
I'm leaving because I want to, got it?
- Better you just go.

892
01:04:10,428 --> 01:04:13,008
We laid on the jealousy
just a little strong there.

893
01:04:13,078 --> 01:04:16,200
Jealous, me?
Keep on dreaming!

894
01:04:16,408 --> 01:04:19,420
What is it then?
- That fresh girl gets on my nerves.

895
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:21,288
I bump into her everywhere!

896
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,387
Oh, I see.. And what are we here for?
- To wash broccoli.

897
01:04:25,723 --> 01:04:29,405
Why didn't you bring your bucket?
- Why? - That one is mine.

898
01:04:29,568 --> 01:04:31,042
Oh, so it's yours?

899
01:04:31,331 --> 01:04:33,744
I'd make you a nice hat out of it.

900
01:04:33,814 --> 01:04:37,731
Say, we don't want our heads to end
up under the fountain now, do we?

901
01:04:38,043 --> 01:04:42,068
Mr. Peppino, is it filled?
- Yes, it is. Go. I'll take care of it.

902
01:04:42,138 --> 01:04:43,304
Fine.

903
01:04:44,476 --> 01:04:48,001
Careful now because
the famous mullets have arrived.

904
01:04:48,194 --> 01:04:49,298
Oh, yeah?

905
01:04:49,825 --> 01:04:52,185
You know I'm really sick of this?
-So?

906
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:56,487
You and your damn mullets! Here,
take them on your face! - You crazy nut!

907
01:04:56,557 --> 01:05:00,857
Let me go, you're hurting me!
- I'll put your head under the fountain.

908
01:05:01,585 --> 01:05:05,532
Mr. Peppino, what are you doing?
- We were joking. Why, what's it to you?

909
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:10,152
What do you want? Get the hell out of here!
One can't have a few words in peace!

910
01:05:10,343 --> 01:05:12,231
Do as you please.

911
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:19,371
See how you make me look?

912
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:23,345
What vulgarity!
I'm ashamed like a thief.

913
01:05:23,759 --> 01:05:26,300
You should be ashamed
of the life you lead.

914
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,570
It's no use, nothing to do.

915
01:05:30,554 --> 01:05:32,143
You'll never learn.

916
01:05:32,398 --> 01:05:33,995
What should I learn?

917
01:05:34,603 --> 01:05:36,850
To be well-mannered, refined.

918
01:05:37,038 --> 01:05:40,134
It takes some polish.
If you knew what it means to a man.

919
01:05:40,204 --> 01:05:42,593
I'm made like this.
I have no polish.

920
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,216
I'm not one of those.
- Yet, I like just those.

921
01:05:46,286 --> 01:05:48,546
Go to them then.
What are you waiting for?

922
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:50,663
I will, don't doubt it.

923
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:53,345
I can hardly wait.
- Go on, then.

924
01:05:54,092 --> 01:05:56,280
Go. What are you doing here?

925
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,911
Why don't you go?

926
01:06:04,882 --> 01:06:08,390
Come on, I'm here now, don't be silly.
- Don't touch me.

927
01:06:08,766 --> 01:06:12,419
Do I annoy you?
- What do I care? Your loss.

928
01:06:12,817 --> 01:06:14,941
You'll see what happen.

929
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:18,230
Calm down, young lady,
nothing will happen.

930
01:06:18,806 --> 01:06:20,130
<i>Mr. Peppino!</i>

931
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:23,837
Mr. Peppino!
Finally I found you!

932
01:06:24,049 --> 01:06:26,220
I'm very sorry, my dear Peppino,

933
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:29,325
but when I said yes this morning,
I didn't know any better.

934
01:06:29,395 --> 01:06:32,073
This is not a child,
this is the Apocalypse!

935
01:06:32,143 --> 01:06:35,042
For heaven's sake, don't say a word.

936
01:06:35,112 --> 01:06:38,182
Sorry, but...
I even had a fight with my husband.

937
01:06:38,252 --> 01:06:41,886
Here's to you. Keep him well!
Ah, thank God!

938
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:54,375
What is there to look at here? Eh?

939
01:06:54,857 --> 01:06:58,454
What is it? You've never seen
a man holding a baby before?

940
01:06:58,524 --> 01:07:02,005
Everybody spellbound?
Is there anything extraordinary?

941
01:07:02,075 --> 01:07:04,202
Is he yours?
- Yes, why?

942
01:07:04,456 --> 01:07:07,315
Is that so strange? Ever seen him before?
- No.

943
01:07:07,385 --> 01:07:11,135
Of course, he arrived this morning
on furlough. Wanna know more?

944
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:15,033
Peppi! Peppi, what happened?
She brought him back? So it's yours?

945
01:07:15,103 --> 01:07:18,360
Yes, it's mine. And I've got 20 more,
got it? 20 more!

946
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:21,268
Well, why?
Somebody not like that?

947
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:24,366
Wherever I roam, I have kids!
- What a rogue!

948
01:07:24,436 --> 01:07:28,133
What are you doing? - Nothing.
What I'm doing is plain to see.

949
01:07:28,287 --> 01:07:32,025
What're you looking at?
What do you want? - Like I care!

950
01:07:32,095 --> 01:07:36,908
Look at these open mouths! How cute!
With those mouths you look like toys!

951
01:07:36,978 --> 01:07:40,907
Am I a freak? Look at me for the last
time for you'll never see me again!

952
01:07:40,977 --> 01:07:44,177
Never again! I'm leaving! Goodbye!

953
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:13,039
Did you know? - About what?
- Mr. Peppino.

954
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:16,134
It seems he'll marry a millionaire.
- A countess!

955
01:08:16,204 --> 01:08:18,640
He was always crazy about the nobility.

956
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:21,731
He got his wish.
- Imagine how jealous Elide is.

957
01:08:21,801 --> 01:08:24,838
You guys know nothing.
- That's the latest news!

958
01:08:24,908 --> 01:08:29,596
What millionaire? She's a slut who eats
up all his money and gets him drunk.

959
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:33,678
Really? - If he keeps it up he'll land
in jail. Indeed, he already did.

960
01:08:33,748 --> 01:08:35,893
What a big mouth!
- It's the truth.

961
01:08:35,963 --> 01:08:39,742
None of it is true.
Because he has a kid with this woman.

962
01:08:39,812 --> 01:08:41,998
And sluts don't have kids.

963
01:08:42,068 --> 01:08:45,814
Hey, are you finished over there?
Shall we go on? Gossips!

964
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:47,807
He's probably gone.

965
01:08:47,877 --> 01:08:52,277
But at least, he should've written me
saying he's well and hi to his friends.

966
01:08:53,032 --> 01:08:55,232
Why, where is he?
- No one knows.

967
01:08:55,497 --> 01:08:59,220
No, I was just saying.
It was just a supposition.

968
01:08:59,788 --> 01:09:02,230
Dear Elide, there's nothing to do.

969
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:07,022
Who cares? The less I see him, the better.
I pity that poor wretch.

970
01:09:07,092 --> 01:09:11,701
Did he put the kid in boarding school?
- Who knows? He didn't tell me anything.

971
01:09:12,074 --> 01:09:14,223
Yet he used to tell me everything.

972
01:09:14,427 --> 01:09:16,884
But he never told me he had a baby.

973
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:21,106
A mystery.
That guy shouldn't be left alone.

974
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:25,231
Lambchop, knock it off!

975
01:09:27,007 --> 01:09:28,871
Mr. AurÃ¨, people in the shop.

976
01:09:28,941 --> 01:09:31,041
Male or female?
- Seems a lady.

977
01:09:31,111 --> 01:09:32,761
Age?
- What do I know?

978
01:09:33,144 --> 01:09:35,959
I'll be right there.
If I may.

979
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:43,974
Anyway, Elide.. I'm there for you too.
- I'll come later.

980
01:09:44,537 --> 01:09:45,649
Excuse me.

981
01:09:46,292 --> 01:09:48,418
MerlÃ¬! - What?
- Listen.

982
01:09:49,487 --> 01:09:53,346
You gotta find him. - But I..
- For your own good, understand?

983
01:09:53,416 --> 01:09:56,709
Here's 50 lire. Go to the police,
go to hospital, wherever.

984
01:09:56,779 --> 01:10:00,303
Take a taxi, a tram, but don't return
until you find out what happened.

985
01:10:00,373 --> 01:10:03,512
I'll be right there, ma'am.
In a blink of an eye.

986
01:10:16,862 --> 01:10:18,762
You played a joke on me, eh?

987
01:10:20,281 --> 01:10:21,858
This is for the lady.

988
01:10:22,772 --> 01:10:27,418
You fell for it, Lambchop, eh? - Ah!
Finally, we remembered we had friends?

989
01:10:27,607 --> 01:10:31,963
They're all asking about you. Have you
seen MerlÃ¬? Up and down looking for you.

990
01:10:32,033 --> 01:10:35,533
Really, who else you want to conquer?
Aren't you satisfied?

991
01:10:35,603 --> 01:10:40,032
You want all the women for yourself?
Are you really trying to beat me?

992
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:43,052
I've beaten you for some time,
Lambchop, I rule.

993
01:10:43,631 --> 01:10:46,592
Suit, shirt, tie: all new, eh?

994
01:10:46,662 --> 01:10:50,182
Even the shoes! Come on,
you must create your masterpiece today.

995
01:10:50,252 --> 01:10:52,426
As you wish, take a seat sir!

996
01:10:52,595 --> 01:10:56,681
Make me gorgeous, fragrant, a superb
scalp rub. Today is a great day.

997
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:58,303
What are you up to?

998
01:10:58,452 --> 01:11:00,902
You found another kid?
- No, Lambchop.

999
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:03,860
If you weren't so mouthy, I'd tell you.

1000
01:11:03,978 --> 01:11:08,279
No need to speak. Just looking at you
I realize you're more hooked than ever.

1001
01:11:08,349 --> 01:11:10,870
Am I wrong?
- You're not, that's it.

1002
01:11:11,471 --> 01:11:13,917
Is it the young lady of the fine?

1003
01:11:14,071 --> 01:11:18,671
Didn't you tell me that.. - What I said
doesn't matter, she's really a good girl.

1004
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:23,931
Then that child was hers? - Yes,
but now I love him as if he were my own.

1005
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:26,690
You should've heard him calling me Papa!

1006
01:11:36,673 --> 01:11:40,289
The gentleman is served!
Now, I can only wish you good luck.

1007
01:11:40,359 --> 01:11:43,964
Your wishes later today, young man.
In my new apartment!

1008
01:11:44,143 --> 01:11:45,396
High places!

1009
01:11:45,749 --> 01:11:49,605
You should see how nice it is.
It's got everything: radiator, lift,

1010
01:11:49,675 --> 01:11:53,526
bar, salon.. And then, what a street!
Via Roberto Mauro.

1011
01:11:53,596 --> 01:11:55,943
What a name.
It smacks of cologne.

1012
01:11:56,013 --> 01:11:58,932
And the number: 72-A!
- Ah!

1013
01:11:59,354 --> 01:12:02,152
Then there's a maid:
if you saw her, you'd faint.

1014
01:12:02,222 --> 01:12:03,606
Wait a second.

1015
01:12:04,798 --> 01:12:08,839
You're more handsome than the sun!
- We always rule, little one!

1016
01:12:08,909 --> 01:12:10,982
Always Peppi.
Even too much.

1017
01:12:11,052 --> 01:12:14,504
Dear Lambchop, even though
I were not to come back here,

1018
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:17,455
I'm leaving my heart in this chair.

1019
01:12:17,836 --> 01:12:21,258
And you don't forget to dust it, OK kid?
Here.

1020
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,807
This is for you personally.

1021
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:25,738
Thank you. It's a tip!

1022
01:12:31,027 --> 01:12:35,125
Shall we do this permanent?
- Right away. It's all at your disposal.

1023
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,895
We finally decided, eh?

1024
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:40,750
Elide!
Come on, give me your hand.

1025
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:44,690
I don't like to stay like this.
Today I don't want to see long faces.

1026
01:12:45,263 --> 01:12:47,263
Don't look in the mirror then.

1027
01:12:50,145 --> 01:12:53,180
Aurelio! 72-A!

1028
01:12:58,083 --> 01:13:00,356
Elide?
Miss Elide?

1029
01:13:00,804 --> 01:13:02,740
Elide!
This way.

1030
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:06,920
It's the day of the masterpieces, eh?
I'll take first prize, today.

1031
01:13:08,622 --> 01:13:11,100
Did you see how I served Peppino?

1032
01:13:11,476 --> 01:13:13,991
How content he was!
He was happy.

1033
01:13:14,364 --> 01:13:16,057
Today, everybody's happy.

1034
01:13:16,127 --> 01:13:19,674
Instead, I must work in this shop
from morning til night.

1035
01:13:20,341 --> 01:13:24,508
Whereas I'd like to go to the movies,
the theater. Enjoy myself a little.

1036
01:13:24,578 --> 01:13:27,347
Today, at the Savoy Cinema, there's a film.

1037
01:13:27,417 --> 01:13:30,267
I'd really like to see that film.
But, alone..

1038
01:13:30,474 --> 01:13:34,806
I had to go with Peppino. But he had
things to do, "A great day for me".

1039
01:13:34,966 --> 01:13:37,565
Indeed, he asked me to go to his home.

1040
01:13:37,635 --> 01:13:40,396
His new home: 72-A.

1041
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,109
He wants to introduce me to somebody.

1042
01:13:44,955 --> 01:13:46,805
How's the movie like? Good?

1043
01:13:47,002 --> 01:13:48,252
It's wonderful.

1044
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,330
Shall we go?

1045
01:13:51,992 --> 01:13:54,572
Wouldn't you like to, with me?
- You bet!

1046
01:13:54,642 --> 01:13:56,272
Damn, I rule!

1047
01:13:56,597 --> 01:14:00,006
Then we'll meet at 5 o'clock
sharp at the Savoy? Great!

1048
01:14:22,918 --> 01:14:24,076
Mr. Peppino.

1049
01:14:27,951 --> 01:14:31,257
Well, shall we go?
I don't like this street.

1050
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:58,200
I'd like to drop in at home and
leave immediately to go to Carletto.

1051
01:14:58,406 --> 01:15:01,579
No, don't go home.
You might run into Olga.

1052
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:03,916
You'd better not see her.

1053
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:09,915
I.. I took the liberty..
I fixed you up a room.

1054
01:15:10,412 --> 01:15:11,739
For you alone.

1055
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:15,367
There you can rest,..
and..

1056
01:15:16,216 --> 01:15:18,434
and maybe tomorrow go to Carletto.

1057
01:15:28,162 --> 01:15:31,916
Have you lived here long?
- Three days. That is, three months.

1058
01:15:32,304 --> 01:15:35,123
The apartment is small,
but nicely partitioned.

1059
01:15:35,193 --> 01:15:38,293
And there's a lot of light.
As if it's always noon.

1060
01:15:40,966 --> 01:15:42,620
Welcome, ma'am.

1061
01:15:47,238 --> 01:15:48,962
Careful, it's slippery.

1062
01:15:50,515 --> 01:15:52,152
<i>What a mess!</i>

1063
01:15:53,851 --> 01:15:55,022
Carletto!

1064
01:15:59,566 --> 01:16:01,868
<i>Oh, Carletto, my Carletto!</i>

1065
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:06,462
What could he break?
- I'm afraid it's the vase with flowers.

1066
01:16:06,532 --> 01:16:08,020
Damn it!

1067
01:16:10,113 --> 01:16:12,899
Wait for me in the dining room.
- Yes, sir.

1068
01:16:14,597 --> 01:16:16,047
I'll be right back.

1069
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:26,346
Yes, darling, mama has come to get you!
And she'll never leave you again.

1070
01:16:27,192 --> 01:16:28,242
Papa!

1071
01:16:33,118 --> 01:16:36,533
Have you kept him with you all this time?
- Yes.

1072
01:16:36,678 --> 01:16:40,978
He must have driven you crazy, I guess.
- No, we soon came to an understanding.

1073
01:16:41,668 --> 01:16:45,840
How good you are!
- Not true, I'm trouble if I get angry.

1074
01:16:46,112 --> 01:16:48,927
Right, Carletto?
- The vase was like that!

1075
01:16:48,997 --> 01:16:51,868
Carletto, Carletto.. Don't tell lies!

1076
01:16:52,978 --> 01:16:55,963
Or the wolf will come and eat you.

1077
01:16:56,615 --> 01:16:57,838
What a pity!

1078
01:16:59,367 --> 01:17:01,810
Come on!
Apologize to Mr. Peppino.

1079
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:04,856
No apologies. We'll buy another one,
right, Carletto?

1080
01:17:04,926 --> 01:17:08,109
Now, if I may, I'll go in
the other room, I must..

1081
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:12,630
But I'll be back soon. - Please.
- Excuse me. - Yes.

1082
01:17:13,665 --> 01:17:17,565
Oh! By the way, there's mail for you.
A telegram and three letters.

1083
01:17:17,635 --> 01:17:19,870
The porter gave them to me.

1084
01:17:23,104 --> 01:17:24,859
Mail!
- Thank you.

1085
01:17:25,283 --> 01:17:27,539
While you read, I'll be inside..

1086
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:29,279
Mystery!

1087
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:32,780
I'll be right back.

1088
01:17:46,753 --> 01:17:47,841
Piero!

1089
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:05,578
Good, good, good, there's everything:
butter, jam, cookies..

1090
01:18:05,648 --> 01:18:08,423
I also found three eggs, you see?
- Wow! Bravo!

1091
01:18:08,493 --> 01:18:13,341
And this? - No, this has to be brought as
last to create an effect, see? - Right.

1092
01:18:13,411 --> 01:18:17,262
Now put it somewhere, then,
when I give you a nod, you show up..

1093
01:18:17,332 --> 01:18:19,130
you know, with a bow,..

1094
01:18:19,836 --> 01:18:22,336
That's it. I leave it to you, eh?
- OK.

1095
01:18:31,893 --> 01:18:34,036
So, shall we go to the dining room?

1096
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,601
It's him!

1097
01:18:40,938 --> 01:18:41,959
Him who?

1098
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:45,110
Carletto's father.

1099
01:18:48,569 --> 01:18:51,301
The child's father. He wants to see him.

1100
01:18:51,677 --> 01:18:53,527
He seems sincere this time.

1101
01:18:53,786 --> 01:18:57,636
He says he can no longer live far away,
and is full of hope.

1102
01:18:58,376 --> 01:19:00,447
And he says that close to me..

1103
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:02,719
What do you think?

1104
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,110
Of course, close to you..

1105
01:19:07,379 --> 01:19:10,229
Where is the Milan Hotel?
Do you have a phone?

1106
01:19:10,504 --> 01:19:14,405
I'd better call him, right?
And then, if he wants to see the baby!

1107
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:17,012
The phone is in the hall.

1108
01:19:25,902 --> 01:19:27,358
Papa! Hey!

1109
01:19:31,677 --> 01:19:32,887
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

1110
01:19:33,409 --> 01:19:34,885
<i>Yes, it's me, Elsa.</i>

1111
01:19:35,433 --> 01:19:38,537
<i>Carletto? He's here with me, he's fine.</i>

1112
01:19:40,223 --> 01:19:43,153
Yes, I'll tell you everything. All.

1113
01:19:43,887 --> 01:19:48,007
You want to? Right away?
I'll take a taxi, 15 minutes at most.

1114
01:19:50,471 --> 01:19:51,525
Sooner?

1115
01:19:53,332 --> 01:19:54,482
I don't know.

1116
01:19:55,452 --> 01:19:56,902
I'll do what I can.

1117
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:58,352
Goodbye.

1118
01:20:08,224 --> 01:20:09,300
Yes.

1119
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:18,570
I'm sorry, but I must leave.
I must go right away.

1120
01:20:18,907 --> 01:20:20,710
Yes. It's better.

1121
01:20:24,427 --> 01:20:27,527
Please, the child's coat and hat.
- Alright, ma'am.

1122
01:20:28,497 --> 01:20:31,324
He's at the Milan Hotel.
Will I find a taxi?

1123
01:20:31,778 --> 01:20:35,196
I hope so. He wanted to come here,
but it's better that I go.

1124
01:20:35,266 --> 01:20:37,100
He's impatient to see me.

1125
01:20:38,762 --> 01:20:42,429
We're going to see dad!
Hold still, honey, we must hurry.

1126
01:20:42,674 --> 01:20:45,653
What a nice fur jacket with a hood!

1127
01:20:46,217 --> 01:20:48,607
How nice!
- With a white hood!

1128
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:51,193
Yes! Papa will love it!

1129
01:20:51,374 --> 01:20:53,281
How nice, my Carletto!

1130
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:54,967
Oh, my dear!

1131
01:20:58,388 --> 01:21:02,530
I'll call you before I leave.
He wants me to go to Milan with him.

1132
01:21:02,778 --> 01:21:04,378
Your phone number?

1133
01:21:06,019 --> 01:21:10,580
35-4-6-1.
- I won't forget it.

1134
01:21:11,172 --> 01:21:12,260
Thank you.

1135
01:21:13,105 --> 01:21:14,465
For everything.

1136
01:21:26,658 --> 01:21:27,805
Come here.

1137
01:21:32,442 --> 01:21:33,637
Papa!

1138
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:47,741
Come on, Carletto.
We'll be right back.

1139
01:21:48,352 --> 01:21:50,502
Isn't it true that we'll be back?

1140
01:22:07,894 --> 01:22:11,444
Yes, it's better that you go.
And then he was naughty today!

1141
01:22:11,607 --> 01:22:14,380
You broke the vase!
I don't wanna see you anymore!

1142
01:22:25,406 --> 01:22:27,122
So then, Mr. Peppino?

1143
01:22:28,252 --> 01:22:29,688
What should I do?

1144
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:32,186
Nothing.

1145
01:22:34,107 --> 01:22:35,688
Today you're free.

1146
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:38,898
And tomorrow as well.

1147
01:22:40,403 --> 01:22:42,072
Indeed, forever.

1148
01:22:45,895 --> 01:22:47,879
Here's what I promised you.

1149
01:22:48,011 --> 01:22:50,911
But..
- But. You did what you had to do, right?

1150
01:22:51,568 --> 01:22:54,292
I'm very sorry.
- What for?

1151
01:23:32,004 --> 01:23:39,932
<i># But, if you're not here with me,
I can no longer live,</i>

1152
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:44,450
<i># you are life to me.</i>

1153
01:23:45,009 --> 01:23:54,029
<i># Only you can give me happiness</i>

1154
01:23:54,280 --> 01:24:00,680
<i># that my heart no longer has
away from you.</i>

1155
01:24:01,134 --> 01:24:07,832
<i># Trembles at night,
the light of the stars,</i>

1156
01:24:08,105 --> 01:24:15,604
<i># looking at them, I try to dream.</i>

1157
01:24:15,674 --> 01:24:23,873
<i># But, if you're not here with me,
I can no longer live,</i>

1158
01:24:23,943 --> 01:24:29,085
<i># you are life to me, you are love.</i>

1159
01:24:39,108 --> 01:24:42,818
<i>Is Mr. Peppino Corradini here?
- He's inside. In the salon.</i>

1160
01:24:49,941 --> 01:24:51,067
Well then.

1161
01:24:52,286 --> 01:24:53,755
Here we are.

1162
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:05,669
Well?

1163
01:25:05,739 --> 01:25:08,492
Well? Well what?
- What do you mean "what"?

1164
01:25:09,993 --> 01:25:11,093
Oh, right.

1165
01:25:12,121 --> 01:25:14,067
I promised you a surprise.

1166
01:25:14,577 --> 01:25:17,866
You thought you'd find a lady?
Instead there's nobody.

1167
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:19,672
I'm alone.

1168
01:25:21,576 --> 01:25:22,671
Alone.

1169
01:25:23,129 --> 01:25:24,829
More surprise than this!

1170
01:25:25,248 --> 01:25:27,448
Well, not bad as gimmick. Bravo!

1171
01:25:27,571 --> 01:25:31,256
Lambchop, you believed it?
Tell me the truth, you fell for it?

1172
01:25:31,962 --> 01:25:34,667
I blew everything, Lambchop!
Everything!

1173
01:25:34,808 --> 01:25:38,546
You really think I could be tied
to one woman all my life? Me?

1174
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:41,373
To play the good husband? Me?

1175
01:25:41,918 --> 01:25:46,186
I laugh at the thought. Can you imagine
me leading a family life, all serious?

1176
01:25:46,256 --> 01:25:49,861
Lunch for two, digesting on
the armchair, reading books..

1177
01:25:49,974 --> 01:25:53,901
Ah, Lambchop! How could I give
up freedom, the life that we live?

1178
01:25:54,171 --> 01:25:57,981
I quickly realized what a mistake
I was making. What a mistake!

1179
01:25:58,184 --> 01:26:01,568
The poor thing didn't want to go,
but I spoke bluntly.

1180
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:04,780
Nicely and with finesse, but clearly.
"But, lady,

1181
01:26:04,939 --> 01:26:07,847
you really think you can stay here?"
Oh, no.

1182
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:10,423
Free!
For heaven's sake, free!

1183
01:26:11,384 --> 01:26:13,084
She was beautiful, yes..

1184
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:15,710
and even refined.

1185
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:19,322
But she's only one, and men
like us need many, Lambchop.

1186
01:26:20,042 --> 01:26:22,078
And then that kid, mama mia!

1187
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:25,934
How he had bored me!
"Chocolates, trumpet, papa!"

1188
01:26:26,231 --> 01:26:28,750
I almost slapped that rascal! Get out!

1189
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:31,786
What do women want from us, Lambchop?
What?

1190
01:26:32,013 --> 01:26:34,963
Forget marriages, husbands,
children, relatives!

1191
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,770
We're not the type!

1192
01:26:37,321 --> 01:26:40,984
They're all slaves!
- All the same, even the ladies.

1193
01:26:41,334 --> 01:26:43,232
You're telling me? A martyr?

1194
01:26:43,302 --> 01:26:47,252
They'll do anything. Even be brought
to the movies to spite someone!

1195
01:26:47,686 --> 01:26:50,237
Freedom, freedom, no strings attached.

1196
01:26:50,681 --> 01:26:53,173
Ah, PeppÃ¬, far better with humble women!

1197
01:26:53,243 --> 01:26:55,968
Sometimes they're not
up to our level, true.

1198
01:26:56,038 --> 01:26:58,138
But at least they're good girls.

1199
01:26:58,598 --> 01:27:00,598
And they don't give surprises.

1200
01:27:01,592 --> 01:27:03,996
I feel reborn, Lambchop. I'm cured.

1201
01:27:04,482 --> 01:27:06,898
We have to celebrate, where do we go?

1202
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,016
Wherever you want.
Oh,..

1203
01:27:09,818 --> 01:27:12,510
I can't.
If only I had known.

1204
01:27:13,387 --> 01:27:16,587
Lambchop, don't leave me.
Don't leave me alone today.

1205
01:27:17,443 --> 01:27:21,790
I can't.. Peppi, I swear..
it's not possible, I'm busy.

1206
01:27:22,243 --> 01:27:23,766
She's a foreigner.

1207
01:27:24,026 --> 01:27:28,802
You know: "<i>Mon cheri, mon amour.
Be with me, with me. Oui, oui! Wa, wa!</i>"

1208
01:27:28,872 --> 01:27:32,572
When they find out you speak foreign,
they won't leave you alone.

1209
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:36,299
Yeah, it's a pain!
- Yeah, a pain indeed! You're right!

1210
01:27:36,808 --> 01:27:40,431
You're right, what do these
women want from us? What?

1211
01:27:40,501 --> 01:27:43,686
Don't they know that we're rulers?
We rule!

1212
01:27:44,321 --> 01:27:45,471
We rule!

1213
01:27:45,855 --> 01:27:47,565
Indeed, you know what?

1214
01:27:47,741 --> 01:27:51,003
The foreign lady is awaiting me
at the Savoy at five.

1215
01:27:51,221 --> 01:27:53,621
Well, I won't go.
I'll make her wait!

1216
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:56,657
You rule, Peppi?
- Strongly. And you?

1217
01:27:57,020 --> 01:28:00,700
I feel like a lion. - Lambchop,
we're born and we'll die rulers.

1218
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:02,691
We rule! - We rule!

1219
01:28:03,991 --> 01:28:07,288
WE RULE!

1220
01:28:08,745 --> 01:28:10,567
SHATTERED LOVE

1221
01:28:41,298 --> 01:28:42,367
Madame.

1222
01:28:45,091 --> 01:28:48,653
Aurelio said he had a date
around here with a foreigner..

1223
01:28:49,537 --> 01:28:52,222
and since I get by with all languages..

1224
01:28:52,453 --> 01:28:56,053
So, you've decided to get back
in the lower districts. - Yeah.

1225
01:28:58,829 --> 01:29:02,362
Wow, how elegant!
What a beautiful coat!

1226
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:06,190
You look taller.
You took off the low heels, eh?

1227
01:29:08,289 --> 01:29:10,711
What became of that disheveled girl?

1228
01:29:11,169 --> 01:29:13,919
What lovely hair!
- This is nothing.

1229
01:29:14,232 --> 01:29:15,732
You'll see tomorrow!

1230
01:29:16,091 --> 01:29:19,318
I'm gonna have it dyed: Titian red.

1231
01:29:19,782 --> 01:29:21,782
They told me it would suit me.

1232
01:29:22,450 --> 01:29:23,970
What do you think?

1233
01:29:25,804 --> 01:29:28,254
Well, I say it's time to call it quits.

1234
01:29:28,652 --> 01:29:32,806
Elide, should we talk seriously?
- Seriously? What happened to you?

1235
01:29:33,419 --> 01:29:35,578
Nothing happened to me.

1236
01:29:36,129 --> 01:29:38,179
And it is precisely for this...

1237
01:29:41,217 --> 01:29:44,225
The film begins, I don't want to miss it.
See you.

1238
01:29:44,295 --> 01:29:45,895
And who's leaving you?

1239
01:29:47,409 --> 01:29:51,009
Mind you, it's a sad film.
With an ending that makes you cry.

1240
01:29:52,372 --> 01:29:54,186
Why, how does it end?

1241
01:29:55,789 --> 01:29:57,265
With a marriage.

1242
01:30:32,834 --> 01:30:34,546
Take off those gloves!

1243
01:30:35,231 --> 01:30:36,947
Well? Are we starting?

1244
01:30:43,673 --> 01:30:45,588
W-e  r-u-l-e
