1
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,140
Nice to meet you, Emma.

2
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,810
Wake up, everyone!

3
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,070
Good morning, everyone! Wake up. It's morning.

4
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,610
It's morning!
-Wake up now.

5
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,990
Wake up. Get dressed.

6
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,430
Hey, Emma. Please tie my hair!

7
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,870
Let me borrow that!

8
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,120
Today's the last day I get to tie your hair for you, huh?

9
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,480
When I grow up, I want to become a "Mother" like Mama.

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,120
I see.

11
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,010
"The monster is over here! It will get you in its hand."

12
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,470
We won't be taken in with your scheme today.

13
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,340
Alright! It's done! Here you go.

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,410
Sorry, Emma!

15
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,270
Phil!

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,920
The Grace Field House Orphanage.

17
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,090
We are all not tied by blood.

18
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,470
Morning!

19
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,060
But...

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,670
Good morning!

21
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,750
We all live in this house full of so much vigor.

22
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,450
Morning, Emma! You are in high-spirits!

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,050
Even when we haven't had breakfast yet.

24
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,330
"Morning," you say. How old are you? 5?

25
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,020
I'm 15, just like you guys!

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,880
No way!

27
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,130
What? You're smaller in height compared to mine!

28
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,130
Stop it, huge-faced woman!

29
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,360
Come on now.

30
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,620
Shut up, pipsqueak!

31
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,530
Emma! Good morning!

32
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,220
Help me over here.

33
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,050
Good morning, Mama.

34
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,440
Living together with a kind Mama, along with a lot of siblings.

35
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,600
Thank you.

36
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,560
Thank you for this meal.

37
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,000
Everyone is a precious family member.

38
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,490
Hans, it's all over your mouth.

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,030
Look over here.

40
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,850
Come on. Here.

41
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,080
I didn't do well at all.

42
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,590
I think I had half of the items right.

43
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,170
Half?! How was it?

44
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,790
Time to announce the results.

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,090
Norman.

46
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,770
Ray.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,970
Emma.

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,570
The 3 of you did amazing!

49
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,460
You three got perfect scores again!

50
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,080
Amazing!

51
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,100
Amazing!

52
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,130
We all do our very best in our studies.

53
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,400
Time to play!

54
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,580
Hooray!

55
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,940
We exert our best efforts in playing all-out with everybody.

56
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,070
Who wants to play a game of tag?!

57
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,220
Yes!

58
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,450
Alright! Norman will be it!

59
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,450
Alright!

60
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,130
Everyone, go and run!

61
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,100
Run, run, run!

62
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,520
1, 2, 3.

63
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,020
Run away!

64
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,260
The House rules indicates that we must never go outside.

65
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,300
We have to abide by that rule.

66
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,450
Phil.

67
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,930
It's dangerous to go beyond that gate.
You mustn't get near it.

68
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,210
Yes.

69
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,870
I got you.

70
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,540
I got caught!

71
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,130
You too, Phi?

72
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,100
You got caught first.

73
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,130
What now? You've captured everyone already?

74
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,360
You too though!

75
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:16,440
If there were kids who could ever escape
from the genius Norman, it'd only be those two.

76
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,370
That hurt!

77
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,280
Norman!

78
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,330
Are you okay?

79
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,890
Emma, I got you.

80
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,810
That was sly of you!

81
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,100
It's all in the game plan.

82
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,120
What do you mean by that?

83
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,860
You need to read your enemy's moves.

84
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,630
You are so unfair!

85
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,200
Emma!

86
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,010
We don't stay in this House forever.

87
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,370
Bye-bye, everyone!

88
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,950
Until we reach the age of 16 years old, we get arranged
to be adopted by our foster parents, and go on traveling to the outside world.

89
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,430
Let's see each other out there.

90
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,850
Be well, Conny.

91
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,520
Get along well with your new family, okay?

92
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,290
Thank you, Emma!

93
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,850
I believe that an unknown yet beautiful future awaits all of us.

94
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,400
Bye-bye.

95
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,750
Bye-bye!

96
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,170
Be well!

97
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,310
However, this place...

98
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,800
...was a world plastered with lies.

99

100
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,210
1 more year left for us to stay here.

101
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,620
If ever you went ahead first, write us a letter, okay?

102
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,500
Of course!

103
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,270
So I say, but I have no one to write to by then.

104
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,370
I'm sure everyone will forget about this place soon.

105
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,490
I'm sure the outside world must be so much fun.

106
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,460
But, you know what?

107
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,370
I will write to you. I promise.

108
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,340
That's...

109
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,990
...Conny's!

110
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,660
She forgot to bring it!

111
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,230
If you chase after her now, you might still make it in time.

112
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,150
When I last took a glance, the lights by the gate are still on.

113
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,420
Let's go hand this over to her!

114
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,060
If we went out this late at night, we'll get scolded.

115
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,030
Moreover, we can't go past the barrier.

116
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,150
But... this is Conny's treasured toy.

117
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,260
Alright.

118
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,930
Let's just both get scolded later.

119
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,160
Conny?

120
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,350
Did you hear a sound just now?

121
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,060
She looks good!

122
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,980
Nothing beats human meat.

123
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,250
This is way out of reach for the likes of us.

124
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:54,260
All of the human meat produced on this farm is high-quality,
it's all luxury merchandise for the rich.

125
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,310
A 6-year old again?

126
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,650
We've been shipping out a lot of average stuff lately.

127
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,640
It's about time soon that we arrange the shipment for those
students that got perfect scores for whom you are so proud of.

128
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,150
Understood.

129
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,580
Wait a moment.

130
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,700
I smell something.

131
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,640
Emma!

132
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,810
Are you alright?

133
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,580
It's not true, right?

134
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,230
That wasn't Mama who we saw a while back.

135
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,980
That wasn't Conny who we saw.

136
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,490
That was... Conny.

137
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,380
Let's run away, Emma. Let's escape from this place.

138
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,040
We may not know what awaits us out there.

139
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,740
But, I'm sure we can escape from here.

140
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,010
I can't do it.

141
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,820
We can. As long as it's you and me.

142
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,930
I can't leave everyone else behind!

143
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,560
If they stay here, they'll get killed!

144
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,210
I don't want any one of our family left to die anymore!

145
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,000
It might be impossible.

146
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,880
No, it's not.

147
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,580
It'll be alright.

148
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,470
Let's escape from this place together with everyone!

149
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,800
Process the preparations.

150
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,940
Let's go.

151
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,330
Were you able to give it to Conny?

152
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,750
We couldn't make it in time.

153
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,780
We're all kept alive for the purpose of being devoured.

154
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,720
Good morning!

155
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,860
The Grace Field House is not an orphanage, but a farm.

156
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,530
Here you are.

157
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,580
Thanks.

158
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,060
Good morning, Emma.

159
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,090
Morning...

160
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Emma!

161
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,680
Good morning!

162
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,660
Come on.

163
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,830
Mama...

164
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,670
Thank you.

165
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,980
Mama is...

166
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,560
Our Mama...

167
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,000
She is the demon's subordinate. She's looking out for us.

168
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,980
The reason she made us think that she was protecting us
from what's out there, is to trap us in here.

169
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,620
This too.

170
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,140
We're livestock.

171
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:47,580
Which explains why we've never gotten any
letters from those who have gone on their travels.

172
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,540
Let's go even if we don't know what lies ahead of this.

173
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,330
A wall.

174
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,290
It's so high.

175
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,170
But you or I could climb up it if we had a rope.

176
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,500
The problem now is how we can get everybody here.

177
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,860
We need to come up with a strategy so we can escape with everyone.

178
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,210
Unless we arrange that, we must never tell the others about what we saw last night.

179
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,760
Not even with Ray?

180
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,790
Do you think he'll believe us? That we're livestock? That Mama's just a caretaker?

181
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:02,930
Is Mama really our enemy here?

182
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,000
She lied to us.

183
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:17,900
What happened?

184
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,890
What should I do?

185
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,800
When we were out in the forest playing with Naila, we got separated from each other.

186
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,810
Is that so?

187
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,700
It'll be okay. Everyone, wait right here. Alright?

188
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,170
Mama...

189
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,730
Mama!

190
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,770
Naila!

191
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,440
I'm so glad you're okay!

192
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,790
I'm so glad!

193
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,100
Naila!

194
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,660
Are you alright?

195
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,910
Okay, everyone. Let's all go back to the house.

196
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,280
Yes!

197
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,610
She found her way too fast!

198
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,070
It's like Mama knew exactly where Naila was.

199
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,770
What Mama was looking at earlier wasn't a watch.

200
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,840
There might be a transmitter embedded somewhere in our bodies.

201
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,860
Probably over here.

202
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,820
In this area?

203
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,300
Everyone has it too.

204
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,900
The ear would be the easiest place to put in a transmitter for livestock.

205
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,480
Mama showed that pocket-watch on purpose.

206
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,780
It's a message telling us that we can't escape as we have a tracker on us.

207
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,450
It lets her know if someone goes beyond the gate.

208
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,010
It's Mama's way of declaring war against us!

209
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,100
Norman, do you have a moment?

210
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,030
What's up?

211
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,740
I can't reach this part here...

212
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,560
When I grow up, I want to become a "Mother" like Mama.

213
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,530
You look pale, Emma.

214
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,660
You don't have a fever, though.

215
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,460
It's nothing, Mama.

216
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,240
Is that so?

217
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,350
You know what? Conny said she wanted to become a "Mother" like you.

218
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,390
Yes. I know.

219
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,470
I'm looking forward to it.

220
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,870
I'm sure Conny will grow to become a
splendid adult, and an amazing mother.

221
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,100
Hey, Emma...

222
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,460
Did you go to the barrier with someone last night?

223
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,550
Dinner is ready, Mama.

224
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,880
I see.

225
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,260
Mama...

226
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,500
I didn't go beyond the gate. That's a given.

227
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,190
Really? That's fine, then.

228
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,310
Mama has been lying to us ever since we were born.

229
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,620
It's done!

230
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,090
We can now use this as a rope.

231
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,210
Next, how do we gather everyone over here?

232
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,350
As I thought, isn't it okay that we tell Ray about this?

233
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,770
You guys!

234
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,040
What are you sneakily talking about over there?

235
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,080
Ray?!

236
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,520
Sorry. I trailed after you guys.

237
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,460
Ever since you guys went to the barrier that night,
you've been acting weird since then.

238
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,550
What are you hiding?

239
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,450
Demons?!

240
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,700
Mama is an enemy?

241
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,980
I understand if you can't believe us, but---

242
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,930
I do.

243
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,840
You're a different matter, Emma. But Norman wouldn't
lie about something like this.

244
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,770
What's with that?!

245
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,620
Come on.

246
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,600
So, when do we escape?

247
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,620
It'll be impossible to bring everyone with us,
but with us three---

248
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,340
No.

249
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,600
I want to end it with Conny.

250
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,660
I don't want to see anyone else in that state.

251
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,640
She said we must bring the younger ones too,
and escape with everyone.

252
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,370
Are you an idiot?

253
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,520
Just escaping this place isn't enough, Emma.

254
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,920
If there are demons in the outside the world, that's even way worse.

255
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,520
There are no place out there where humans can live in.

256
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,830
If you take everybody with you, we'll all get annihilated.

257
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,750
But...!

258
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,800
Leave them behind.

259
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,570
That's the best choice.

260
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,390
No!

261
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,820
If there's none, then let's create it!

262
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,120
A place in the outside world where humans can thrive!

263
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,040
Let's change the world!

264
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,970
Let's change it! With our own hands!

265
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,840
Norman! You too?!

266
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,770
Please! Cooperate with us!

267
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,010
Let's escape from this place with everybody! Alright, let's go!

268
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,160
Well, before that, we need to know who our enemy is.

269
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,960
So, how do we do it?

270
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,210
Are you an idiot?

271
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,890
What the demons are after, is our brain.

272
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,700
The more developed our brains are, the tastier it is.

273
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:16,050
That's why they're letting us study, to develop our brains better.

274
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:21,980
Once you're past 6, you're plucked out in ascending order of our scores.
We're all shipped out unconditionally once we hit 16.

275
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,510
Remember what that demon said?
Those 3 students with perfect scores.

276
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,440
They're talking about you, me and Ray.

277
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,350
If we're doing this, we need to win.

278
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,670
For that purpose, we need to do something about these transmitters first.

279
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,610
Touching it is risky too because we might break them.

280
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,550
That's why, we must only destroy it until the time we escape.

281
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,240
But, how do we destroy it?

282
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:55,590
With this size and shape, something comes to mind.

283
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,070
Can you leave this matter to me?

284
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,050
You're fine with it?

285
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,230
Yeah.

286
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,680
If you say so...

287
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,880
Take a look!

288
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,820
Look at what I found!

289
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,580
Here we go.

290
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,100
You see this owl here? It has different text in each books.

291
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,140
You're right, Phil! You did great in finding these!

292
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,360
Well, yeah.

293
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:32,010
Seems like all these books are from Mr. Minerva.

294
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,580
If we're looking for Minerva's books, this room is full of it.

295
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,900
Oh? This is...

296
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,180
Doesn't this look like Morse Code?

297
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,280
Morse Code?

298
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:52,450
D-O-U-B-T.

299
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,850
Doubt.

300
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,900
Doubt?

301
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,430
And this one is "RUN."

302
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,620
Run.

303
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,270
Farm. Truth.

304
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,480
Danger.

305
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,280
And this one is...

306
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,690
Promise.

307
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:18,050
I get the feeling that all these will turn out
to be important guides for us.

308
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,030
What's our basis?

309
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,950
My instinct.

310
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:20,810
What?!

311
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,390
If this really was a message addressed to us...

312
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,410
Then, in the outside world, we have an ally named "Minerva."

313
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,260
Seriously?!

314
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,130
Everyone! Gather around!

315
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,230
I will introduce her to you.

316
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:51,550
This is Sister Krone. She has come to assist me.

317
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,070
I will live with all of you starting today.

318
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,240
Pleased to meet you all!

319
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,810
Let's all get along well.

320
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,530
Mama just initiated her first move.
She now has a wider look in this House.

321
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:14,190
Taking all of that into consideration,
the next shipment will be in a month and half.

322
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,310
Before that happens, we need to come up with a plan to bring everyone with us.

323
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,350
So we say, but they all completely trust Mama.

324
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,100
Will they be able to handle the truth?

325
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,240
Moreover, how do we even take everybody with us?

326
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,250
There are those who aren't physically ready for this.
They'll only hold us back!

327
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,550
I do have an idea for that.

328
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,770
I've heard a lot about you. Under your leadership, this plant
has shipped more top-quality produce than any other.

329
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,530
I am honored to have the chance to work under a person I admire and respect the most.

330
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,980
These are documents on my dear children.

331
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,320
Memorize all of them right here, right now.

332
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:55,860
Yes.

333
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,650
Game of tag?

334
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,740
Training disguised as a game?

335
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,330
I'll teach them how to use their bodies better.

336
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,130
About how to better use their brains, I leave that to the two of you.

337
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,600
Mama won't know if we execute it through playing.

338
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,550
However, why have I been summoned here?

339
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,250
They figured out the secret.

340
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,340
They saw what was in the truck, too.

341
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,670
T-Then, we should find and ship them out, as per the rules!

342
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,700
It's fine.

343
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,990
There is no need for that.

344
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,950
Just as long as they don't escape until their shipment date.

345
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,460
You won't inform the higher-ups about this?

346
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,520
I won't.

347
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:52,270
I'll properly take appropriate countermeasures against the kids myself.

348
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,800
You don't need to think of anything else.

349
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,500
Just take a close look after them, that's all.

350
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,450
You understand, right? Sister Krone.

351
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,340
I will do so, Mama Isabella.

352
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,150
Emma!

353
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,610
Take care.

354
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,850
I'm heading off.

355
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,150
Alright, so Norman's team will be it!

356
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,300
Alright!

357
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,740
Alright, everyone! Run!

358
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,460
1, 2, 3.

359
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,770
Run!

360
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,710
Let's sharpen our skills!

361
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,590
Keep stomping your feet!

362
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,240
A bit more!

363
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,190
More, more!

364
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,510
Okay, let's go!

365
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,920
Once you're done setting tracks, go this way.

366
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,310
Leave those branches here.
Thoma, get those prints done.

367
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,930
Let's go!

368
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,950
Ready, go!

369
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:25,170
1, 2, 3! Alright! Go! Great job!

370
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,410
Okay! You can do it!

371
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,340
Alright, you got it.

372
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,620
Come here. Over here.

373
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,050
Alright, you got it!

374
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,220
There you go!

375
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,660
Foot prints!
-Alright, everyone! This way!

376
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,660
No.

377
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,230
Those are fake prints.

378
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,350
Don't get deceived!

379
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,610
As expected from you!

380
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,260
The right way is this way. Come on, let's go!

381
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,060
Let's go!

382
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:51,610
Listen, when it comes to playing tag, it's a game that needs strategic plan.

383
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,310
We need to think about how the enemy moves.

384
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,130
That looks like a lot of fun.

385
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,520
Game of tag.

386
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,670
Let me in, too.

387
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,920
What? What do you mean?

388
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,090
I want to get along with everybody.

389
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,990
Sister, can you even run?

390
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:12,600
Of course! I'll capture all of you in one go!

391
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,690
Got you now!

392
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,580
This is a nice opportunity to know more about our enemy.

393
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,630
The match runs for 20 minutes.

394
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,980
I'll be it.

395
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,590
All of you, run away well. Alright?

396
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,650
Alright!

397
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:31,460
1, 2, 3, 4!

398
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,540
Expose the targets. I will take over Isabelle as the "Mama" of this house.

399
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,540
Run!

400
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,120
I got you!

401
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,930
Come here!

402
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,060
Got you!

403
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,960
Okay, got you.

404
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,060
We need to escape!

405
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,960
Okay, stop!

406
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,990
I got you!

407
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,160
Wait!

408
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,320
Next up, the 3 kids with full scores.

409
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,370
Emma! Surrender now and come out.

410
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:29,650
If ever you saw the harvest that night,
then I'm on your side.

411
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,110
Found you!

412
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,600
You got caught too, Emma?

413
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,740
2 more to go!

414
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,360
How many minutes left?

415
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,080
8 minutes and 40 seconds!

416
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,420
Good luck!

417
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,290
No way.

418
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,500
Too slow!

419
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,520
Where is he?

420
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,730
Why?

421
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,490
I can't capture him.

422
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,710
20 minutes match results: it's our victory. Sister.

423
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,370
These guys aren't just perfect-scores children.

424
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,790
You don't need to know who the targets are.

425
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,940
I have already taken control of this situation.

426
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,630
You don't have to do anything.

427
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,570
Yes, as you said, I am looking over them.

428
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,440
So...?

429
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,410
How did the game of tag with the children go?

430
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,400
What do you think of my children?

431
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,240
From what you have seen.

432
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,240
They're absolutely excellent, special children.

433
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,670
I see.

434
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,990
You understand it, don't you?

435
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,580
You're clever.

436
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,940
I expect you to stop making the wrong choices.

437
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,430
You may now withdraw.

438
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:29,040
Aside from that game of tag, Mama nor Sister
hasn't made any moves after that.

439
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,420
I'm sure they're thinking that they don't care even
if we know the secret as long as we can't escape from here.

440
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,120
Aside from the adults, someone else is keeping an eye on us.

441
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,190
There's a rat among the kids.

442
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,230
What?!

443
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:49,440
The kids do better at getting close to us more than the adults can.

444
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,290
Wait! Who would do that---!

445
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,830
We're all good children! No one would betray among us---

446
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,220
While we have no idea as to what we can do for now,
they must have already been feeding her information.

447
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:58,980
No way.

448
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,830
Of course, there's a possibility that they're the older ones.

449
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,770
Amazing!

450
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,130
So? What do we do?

451
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:13,960
Still, I need to tell the others about the house's secret.

452
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,360
Even when there's a chance that a spy is among them?

453
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,150
First, let's start with Don and Gilda.

454
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,300
What sick joke is this?

455
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,300
Mama is a breeder?

456
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,040
You mean, that "Mama" who has been so kind to us?!

457
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,800
Don...

458
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,970
Stop saying all that nonsense!

459
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,010
What do you mean by demons eating us?

460
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,340
What kind of a made-up story is that?!

461
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,320
Calm down!

462
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,470
That we're food!

463
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,410
Aren't we supposed to be family? Siblings?

464
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,390
It's all fake.

465
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,690
Stop kidding with me!

466
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,250
Stop it! It may be hard to believe, but we're telling the truth!

467
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,250
Believe in us! We want you to escape with us!

468
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,740
Did you see it?

469
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:18,130
Conny's... last state.

470
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,150
I believe in you.

471
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,040
Emma... you who loves Mama so much!

472
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,780
There's no way you'd make up a lie like this!

473
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,430
After all...

474
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,430
...aren't we family?

475
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,670
Gilda.

476
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,260
I'm glad they came to believe us.

477
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,160
When should we tell the other kids?

478
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,330
Before that... we're doing all this so we can expose who Mama's spy is.

479
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,210
I set up a trap for those two.

480
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,820
A trap?

481
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,780
I each told them where the dummy ropes were kept hidden.

482
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,030
I told Don there's a rope under my bed.

483
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,610
I told Gilda that the rope's in the ceiling of the second-floor bathroom.

484
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:31,450
Whichever rope disappears from either spots,
then we'll know who's the spy.

485
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,010
Good morning, Emma.

486
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,040
Norman.

487
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,360
You couldn't sleep?

488
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,360
Was just thinking if there's anything I can do on my own.

489
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,150
I see.

490
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,610
Once we do figure out who the spy is, will you leave that person behind?

491
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,850
Of course, not.

492
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,540
We will take them with us.

493
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,490
Even when they lied to us?

494
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:03,710
Even if they're the spy, they were still raised together with us.

495
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:08,700
Even if they lie and betray us, I still want to believe in them til the end.

496
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,750
That's right.

497
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,420
Norman.

498
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,090
What happened with the rope you set-up?

499
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,530
It disappeared. The one below my bed.

500
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,940
So, the Spy is Don?

501
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,670
No...

502
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,940
The spy was you... Ray.

503
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,790
Sorry. I lied to you, too.

504
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,680
I told Don a different location.

505
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,340
What do you mean?

506
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,240
I set-up a trap for 3 people.

507
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,270
Don, Gilda, and Ray.

508
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,730
And I thought it was going well.

509
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,250
That's right.

510
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,960
I am Mama's spy.

511
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,760
No way.

512
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:25,670
You being the spy would benefit the enemy the most.
There's no one else who can influence our plans better aside from you.

513
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,640
I guarantee regulation on the kids for Mama.

514
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:37,900
I am the device that makes sure everything goes as planned.

515
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,550
You can see me as the lapdog of the shepherd.

516
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,860
Why are you acting as Mama's lapdog?

517
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,950
I volunteered myself.

518
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:57,260
You know what? I found out the House's secret.

519
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,330
I want to make a deal with you, Mama.

520
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,810
Deal?

521
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:11,150
I asked her for two things.
I told her I will work for her, so she won't ship me out immediately.

522
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,740
And the other one...

523
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,180
If I showed satisfactory results, I will receive rewards.

524
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,400
Rewards?

525
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,540
With all kinds of junk.

526
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:23,880
If the House doesn't have it, I can have it delivered from the outside world.

527
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:29,010
But, Ray. You haven't told Mama yet about where the real rope is hidden, right?

528
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,320
That's right!

529
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,580
You're the one who set this whole escape in motion.

530
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,690
If you really are a loyal lapdog, then you wouldn't do this.

531
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,310
Is that true, Ray?

532
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,500
Yeah.

533
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:56,160
Everything that I did was for the sake of this very moment!

534
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,980
I did all of this in preparation for this escape plan!

535
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,030
Ray...

536
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,780
I've been preparing everything ever since I learned the truth of House's secret...

537
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,650
...so that no one will ever figure it out.

538
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:15,690
I deceived Conny who knew nothing, stole her little bunny,
and let the two of you go to the gate!

539
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,310
All of this was so that you both may never get killed!

540
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,230
Then, is that why you said you had an idea
about how to destroy the transmitters?

541
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,770
I've seen the actual things. I made experiments.

542
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,100
I affirm it.

543
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,640
The transmitters can be neutralized for sure.

544
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:46,960
You mean, you did that experiment from someone's ear?

545
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,690
To achieve that, don't tell me you had to sacrifice someone?

546
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,750
It must've been hard for you.

547
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,160
To have stayed quiet and not say anything after knowing the truth.

548
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,550
But, you must never use that plan again.

549
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,650
You're no longer alone in this.

550
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,260
Let's go to the outside world, together with everybody!

551
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,710
Ray is our best trump card!

552
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,760
He can deceive Mama. He's the best double spy!

553
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,780
What?

554
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,820
Double spy.

555
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,080
Don't you think that sounds cool, Ray?

556
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,160
Are you stupid?

557
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:58,760
Come on!

558
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,550
You can't always keep calling me an idiot!

559
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,490
My bad.

560
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,620
Okay. Well then, let's go make that rope.

561
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,370
Come on, let's do it.

562
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,640
Alright.

563
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,050
With this, we can destroy the transmitter from the other aside.

564
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,210
Once my package arrives tomorrow from outside, then it's completed.

565
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,930
Emma is taking this too lightly.

566
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:56,000
If we're seriously escaping, then you, me and Emma...

567
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,970
Together with Don and Gilda, just the 5 of us.

568
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,800
Emma won't be satisfied with this.

569
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,160
Then, just deceive her.

570
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:11,190
Pretend to take everyone with you,
but it should only be the 5 of us who escapes for real.

571
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:12,060
We can't do that.

572
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,670
Why? You do know, right?

573
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,640
That it'd be impossible to take everyone along with us!

574
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,280
That's what I thought from the start.

575
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:24,920
That night. The first time I saw Emma cry.

576
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,030
I thought, she might be crying because she fears dying.

577
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,040
Because, that's what I thought so too.

578
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,370
But, I was wrong!

579
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,200
Emma... she was crying because she was scared that our family might die.

580
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:45,900
In that situation, she was even thinking of protecting everyone.

581
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,330
I thought, she's really amazing.

582
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,790
And then, it came to me.

583
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,170
I wanted her to smile.

584
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,280
What I want now is to have Emma smile.

585
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:01,980
Because, I like her.

586
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:07,060
I mean, of course--- as family!

587
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,700
Stop making that face.

588
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,320
I want to become like her too.

589
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,380
Become someone like Emma.

590
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,280
Who will never give up in believing others.

591
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:30,110
No matter how implausible things gets, if it's Emma, I'm sure she can do it.

592
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:40,080
I never expected you to be a useless dog that
can't even keep watch while I'm away.

593
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,360
I already learned from it and even sold my friends to you.

594
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,140
I'm even reporting to you about what Sister Krone has been up to.

595
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:50,400
Besides, there was no need to have made them
see Conny in that state, right?

596
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,700
So, what did you come to report to me?

597
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:02,750
Norman is trying to kill you.

598
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,520
So?

599
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,700
They're gathering detergent and herbicide.

600
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,280
Poisoning?

601
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:11,470
Yeah.

602
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:15,010
So, there's a need to swap those chemicals with fake ones.

603
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,710
Do you know the location?

604
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,000
You'll do it with me?

605
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,020
Let's take care of it.

606
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,140
That concludes my report.

607
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:26,820
Oh, right.

608
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,640
I'll tell you in advance.

609
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:34,000
I received communication from the brass.

610
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,650
There will be no shipment next month.

611
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,980
Then, when's the next shipment?

612
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,050
January.

613
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,260
Your birthday.

614
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:49,740
It's finally me for the next ship out?

615
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,780
As you asked, we've brought detergent and herbicide.

616
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,890
Thank you. This will be helpful for when we're scouting.

617
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,520
You mean, you're climbing up the wall?

618
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,470
I and Emma will scale the wall and see what's outside.

619
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,800
What about the transmitters?

620
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:11,010
To make sure they're not checking,
Ray will stall her for us.

621
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,310
I'll handle Mama. Don and Gilda, you handle Sister.

622
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,100
What?! How do we do that?

623
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:19,040
How will you stall me?

624
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,910
So you guys really were Mama's targets.

625
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,270
Want to work with me?

626
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,140
I want to escape too...

627
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,700
...from my current situation.

628
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,560
There is a chip planted under this.

629
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:48,220
If you even take one step outside a farm, this chip will
discharge electricity and stop my heart.

630
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:51,610
I can only live inside these walls.

631
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:58,550
That's why I want the best possible
life for myself within the walls of a farm.

632
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,750
Live in the best farm.

633
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,570
Be surrounded with the best children ever.

634
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,790
Become the best "Mama" there ever is.

635
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,430
Do you know where I plan to do that?

636
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,910
In this very farm!

637
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,350
I need to get rid of Isabella...

638
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,010
...and become the "Mama" of this place!

639
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:27,020
If you kids escape, she'll be held responsible and will be disposed of.

640
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:33,160
Us running away will benefit you.

641
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,840
That's why, let's all work together in this.

642
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:38,770
The enemy is: Mama Isabella.

643
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,000
You were also born in a House too, Sister?

644
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:48,660
Yes, but not here in Plant 3.

645
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:56,430
What else? I'll tell you every information that only I know about!

646
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:01,990
If you still doubt me, you can come to my room tonight.

647
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:04,490
Come over.

648
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:11,720
She wants concrete proof so she won't ship us out yet.

649
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:15,370
Until she gets concrete proof of the uprising,
she's just pretending to socialize with us.

650
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:19,440
Then we shouldn't trust her, and not allow her to gather proof.

651
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:22,700
On top of that, let's just go and get the information we need from her.

652
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,800
Welcome, come in.

653
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,380
Well then, what do you want to know?

654
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,500
Do you know about the outside world?

655
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:46,280
Unfortunately, I've never seen the outside world myself too.

656
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,990
However, there are humans outside.

657
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,100
Since when have the demons been here?
Why has the world turned this way?

658
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:01,160
A long time ago, a long-withstanding war persisted.

659
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,790
There were humans who got preyed on by demons,
and humans who revolted.

660
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:11,250
When the demons and humans got tired of the endless battles,
they both made a promise .

661
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:12,810
Promise?

662
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:16,740
That they will divide the world where each side can live in peace.

663
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:21,470
They made a promise where the demons won't mess with
the humans, and the humans will stop killing demons.

664
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:31,230
The humans left a portion of their population in the demon world,
and the other humans disappeared and lived on the other part of the world.

665
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,120
Those who got left behind were slowly preyed on by demons.

666
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:39,150
They got subjugated and became food meat for the demons.

667
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,640
That's why this farm exists.

668
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,220
You are all raised for the purpose of being devoured.

669
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,330
What about the farm security?

670
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:58,980
Not that big of a deal.

671
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,880
There aren't that many guards deployed.
I don't even think they do regular rounds.

672
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,330
Even if we escape, they can check the transmitters.

673
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:10,840
You knew.

674
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:15,910
This one.

675
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,780
Mama showed it to us.

676
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:21,090
Do you know where it's located?

677
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:24,640
Where is it?

678
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,700
In your ear.

679
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,730
That's right. Thank you so much.

680
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,650
Let's go.

681
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:41,890
What? That's all?

682
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,180
No way.

683
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,990
You already know, huh?

684
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,430
How to destroy the transmitters.

685
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,540
Words aren't the only source of information, you know?

686
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:01,700
Their attitude, sight, blinking.

687
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:07,860
You learned that the transmitters were in the ear,
but you didn't try to touch and check.

688
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:10,510
Why is that?

689
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:12,620
Because, you already know.

690
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:17,800
You already know how to destroy the transmitters!

691
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,240
How do you destroy it?

692
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,270
Did you use some kind of tool?

693
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,730
Could it be...

694
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,940
You made it?

695
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,130
You made it yourself!

696
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,180
So you made it.

697
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,290
It's okay. She haven't gathered proof yet.

698
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,350
Let's go.

699
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:52,860
You made it.

700
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,650
Come by and play with me next time!

701
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:02,430
Until I get proof, you all won't be shipped out.

702
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:13,070
I look forward for that woman to mess up so badly!

703
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,870
I will become this house's "Mama"!

704
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,440
It has arrived. The promised reward.

705
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,100
Thank you.

706
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,940
I'll still be alive in the next 2 months, so I'll use this to commemorate that.

707
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,160
That's right.

708
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:34,350
By the way, Sister has started getting close to us again.

709
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,760
I see.

710
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,430
She never understood the warning I gave her.

711
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,080
Well, tomorrow then.

712
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,780
Well then.

713
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:53,820
It's about time.

714
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,870
Hey. Look my way. Come on.

715
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,480
Smile!

716
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:08,250
What's that? What's that?

717
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:11,710
Lemme see! Lemme see!

718
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,690
Amazing! Let's take a photo with everyone!

719
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:15,190
Then, I'll take it.

720
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:15,900
No, I'll take it.

721
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,440
Me!

722
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:17,450
No, I'll take it.

723
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:18,210
Go ahead!

724
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,660
Let's take a photo with everyone!

725
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:22,020
Come on! Let's take some photos!

726
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:24,770
Mama! Sister too!

727
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,520
Alright, taking it now. Everybody, smile!

728
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:30,650
Here I go!

729
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:32,680
Ready, go!

730
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:41,620
That camera is the last component.

731
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:44,580
We can now destroy the transmitter.

732
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,310
Alright, later this afternoon will be the inspection.

733
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,250
Once the inspection is done, it's about time we escape.

734
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:56,890
Ray, Emma, Norman! Here I go!

735
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,870
Ready, go!

736
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,600
Let me see.

737
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:07,180
Alright! Everyone! Let's do some laundry!

738
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,120
Yes!

739
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,310
Don't wanna.

740
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,450
Don't wanna do chores.

741
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:25,700
Time for a raid!

742
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,010
That will destroy the transmitters?

743
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:49,700
Yeah.

744
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,650
Where do we hide it?

745
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,050
Sorry, Phil! We need to borrow your piggy bag for a bit.

746
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:06,750
Got it!

747
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,580
She's already searched her so this spot will be fine.

748
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,040
Alright!

749
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,080
Emma, this is bad!

750
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,690
My piggy bag!

751
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:45,710
Oh, you guys...

752
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,200
Is the proof in here?

753
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,180
Oh?

754
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,310
There's something in here.

755
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,000
I can hear it making a sound!

756
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:03,750
I wonder what's inside?

757
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:06,720
Should I open it and see?

758
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,560
Sister Krone...

759
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:29,340
This is from headquarters.

760
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,070
Open it and read.

761
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,470
I have been appointed as "Mama" of the 4th plant?

762
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,550
It's unfortunate that we have to part ways.

763
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:55,270
Pack your luggage at this very instance and go back to headquarters.

764
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,730
Grandmother is waiting for you at the gate.

765
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,130
Right now?

766
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:03,480
Farewell.

767
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:34,520
As if I will allow things to go the way you want it to.

768
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,390
Grandmother...

769
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,640
There's something I need to report.

770
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:05,400
There are kids from Plant 3 who knows the secret.

771
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:09,160
The 3 top students are taking the others with them
and are planning to escape!

772
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,100
But...

773
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,640
She is keeping them under control, right?

774
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,410
If she has them under control...

775
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,260
...then there is no problem.

776
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:22,900
But as per rules---

777
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,960
I did the same thing too. I had her under control.

778
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:34,790
Also, no one is as capable as Mama Isabella with her best techniques.

779
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,560
She is special.

780
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:41,010
Her and her Plant.

781
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:57,200
You can never replace her.

782
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:05,030
It's my loss.

783
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:31,120
You must absolutely escape, you damn kids.

784
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:42,600
Thank you for this meal.

785
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,510
Well then, I'm going now.
I leave the lookout to you guys.

786
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:02,170
If ever Ray can't stall Mama, let me know asap.

787
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:03,230
Got it!

788
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,500
Let's start with swapping the materials.

789
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:17,600
Yes.

790
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:31,660
Sister Krone.

791
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,110
I've eliminated her.

792
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:39,790
I no longer needed her here, so I disposed of her.

793
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:43,750
Same to you too.

794
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:49,980
From now on, I'll keep them on a leash myself.

795
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,180
What are you---

796
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,500
Hey, wait! Hey!

797
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,470
Hey! I said wait! Hey!

798
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:02,000
Wait! Hey!

799
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:04,610
What?

800
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,110
What's the meaning of this?

801
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:08,440
Ray didn't give us a signal but Mama is here!

802
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:17,140
Did something happen?

803
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:17,920
Don?

804
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:19,680
I'll go check inside the house!

805
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:25,110
Dammit!

806
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:40,060
That hurt!

807
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:41,000
Sorry.

808
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,400
More over, Ray...!

809
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:45,240
Let's go! We need to stop Mama!

810
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:17,030
What's wrong, Mama?

811
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:23,440
14 years. We've lived together for 14 years.

812
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:28,060
But this is the first time I'm talking to you without pretense.

813
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:36,600
Nice to meet you, Emma.

814
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:38,600
Norman.

815
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,610
Right now, we are talking to each other as breeders and livestock.

816
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,250
But, please don't take this the wrong way.

817
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,490
I love all of you.

818
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:56,760
That is why... I came here because I want you to give up.

819
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,040
Give up?

820
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:00,590
What about?

821
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:04,530
Resisting.

822
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,170
You've lived in a loving, comfortable home.

823
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:15,270
You die feeling content and satisfied.

824
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:20,500
What about that makes you unhappy?

825
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,620
Escaping is futile.

826
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,410
Your time has been decided until the very end.

827
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:33,910
You, all 5 of you... I wanted you all to live a happy life.

828
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:44,270
Go, Norman!

829
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:54,180
Emma!

830
01:03:58,380 --> 01:03:59,920
You're alright!

831
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,260
It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt.

832
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,990
You just broke your leg.

833
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:12,440
You are top-notch children I raised with affection.
I need to protect all of you.

834
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:18,320
With this, you won't be able to move for the meanwhile.

835
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:21,560
Tomorrow will go as planned.

836
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:24,270
Tomorrow?

837
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,850
Behave and celebrate that day with us, Emma.

838
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:38,620
I've received word from the brass.

839
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:41,410
Congratulations, Norman.

840
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,050
Your shipment date has been decided.

841
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,640
I need to talk to you.

842
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:57,940
Norman, you need to escape tomorrow on your own.

843
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:02,870
Sorry, I can't.

844
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:03,810
We decline that.

845
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:06,780
Come on, just listen.

846
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,520
To be more precise, pretend to run away tomorrow.

847
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:12,050
Hide until Emma heals her leg.

848
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:15,420
And then, escape with us when we do.

849
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:19,830
If I run away, you or Emma might get shipped off.

850
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:25,060
I absolutely don't want any of the two of you to take my place.

851
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:30,860
Thank you.

852
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:32,500
It'll be okay.

853
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:35,120
I've already sorted out my feelings.

854
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,470
Sorted?

855
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:40,220
They can take my life all they want.

856
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:46,790
But, I'm not giving them anything else.

857
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:51,450
I will win this. I'll make sure your escape plan is a success.

858
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,140
That's more than enough for me.

859
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,220
Norman...

860
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:01,120
This is fine.

861
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:03,370
No, it's not.

862
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,310
No way this is fine!

863
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:10,810
I've prepared everything for the last 9 years so I can save the two of you!

864
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:14,390
Even if you run away, Emma won't get shipped off until she heals her leg.

865
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:18,450
Only I will get shipped out! So, run away!

866
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:24,630
Here!

867
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:28,220
Then, you two can just break your own leg too.

868
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,170
A good idea, right?

869
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:32,030
Let's all get a fracture!

870
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:33,310
Emma, what are you---

871
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:36,220
We have to be in the best possible shape or we won't get shipped out!

872
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:39,620
Now that's an idea! Time to break something.

873
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,110
No, wait. There's no guarantee that they'll delay the shipment if you're hurt.

874
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:44,970
Then, let's catch a terrible cold.

875
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:47,310
They won't eat you if you're sick!

876
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:53,780
You guys are so strange.

877
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,620
We're not!

878
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:59,220
That's way better than having you get killed!

879
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:06,620
Didn't you say it yourself? That we will escape together with everyone!

880
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:11,610
If you aren't with us, then I don't want it!

881
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:23,850
It'll all be okay.

882
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,880
We will escape from this place with everyone.

883
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:31,920
Let's all live together.

884
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:34,330
Norman.

885
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:14,380
Hey...

886
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:19,280
Since when did you know the House's secret, Ray?

887
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:25,780
I still have memories from when I was an infant.

888
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:26,990
What?!

889
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:31,060
People naturally lose their memories of when they were still babies.

890
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:33,280
It's called Childhood Amnesia.

891
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:36,290
Only those memories from the age of two to four years get forgotten.

892
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,710
However, I was different.

893
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:43,100
I still have memories in me of days before I got into this House.

894
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:47,510
Then, you remember your mom's face?

895
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:49,840
I don't.

896
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:54,900
If it's memories before coming to the House,
then do you remember anything from outside?

897
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:58,360
Yeah. From when I got into the headquarters.

898
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:00,080
Headquarters?

899
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:03,600
Ever since I got out from my mother's womb, it was the first place I saw.

900
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:08,510
I saw demons and adults, and a lot of other babies aside from me.

901
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:11,000
After that, I was brought to this House.

902
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:16,200
That's why, you can't run away from the gate.

903
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:18,690
It's connected to Headquarters.

904
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:24,320
Use this on the transmitter so you can head to the other side.

905
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,140
Place this on your left ear and turn the switch.

906
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:30,480
Thank you.

907
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:33,750
Don and Gilda are creating a new rope.

908
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:36,840
For the meanwhile, you need to erase your presence tomorrow.

909
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:40,040
Until Emma's leg heal, then we escape.

910
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:41,960
Understood.

911
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:53,460
We will never let you die, Norman.

912
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:03,270
We will all live and escape from this place for sure!

913
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,610
Yeah!

914
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,830
What is this?

915
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:40,760
Everyone! I have good news!

916
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,520
What's it about?

917
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,880
We've found a foster home for Norman!

918
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,210
This might be sudden but he's heading off tonight.

919
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:48,310
Tonight?

920
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:49,240
Is this goodbye?

921
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:49,740
That's right.

922
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,080
That makes me sad, but...

923
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:53,880
Congrats, Norman.

924
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:56,990
Congrats!

925
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:01,030
Anna... Sherry...

926
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:03,740
Congrats!

927
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:05,700
Thank you, everyone!

928
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,550
Write us a letter!

929
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,580
Well then.

930
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:36,550
See you.

931
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:47,630
Let's go.

932
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:57,310
Emma.

933
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:00,920
Don't force yourself, okay?

934
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,200
We'll bring more next time if it's not enough.

935
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:13,540
Thank you.

936
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:15,770
Be careful, Norman.

937
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:18,380
We'll all escape together.

938
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:20,190
I'm going.

939
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:34,820
It'll be okay. It'll all work out.

940
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:10,170
Alright! Gather around, everyone.

941
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,290
Will something interesting happen?

942
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,550
Are you okay?

943
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,930
Oh?

944
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:24,700
Norman isn't in here.

945
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,710
Norman!

946
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:43,730
Hey!

947
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,860
Everyone's here! Hurry and come!

948
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:50,420
Over here! Over here!

949
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:56,850
Why did he come back?

950
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:08,720
You rascal! What are you doing?!

951
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:10,470
I made sure to make a way.

952
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:11,130
What?!

953
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:13,310
I climbed on top of the wall.

954
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:16,710
It's a cliff ahead the wall.

955
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:20,740
It's not a height that we can just jump over.

956
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:25,690
So, this is the outcome of what I found when I was walking up there.

957
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:31,210
We are probably in the 3rd Plant.

958
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:33,490
This here is the headquarters.

959
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:36,520
It was only this portion here that had a bridge.

960
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:39,370
If you're escaping, you need to go through this bridge.

961
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:44,390
Norman, Mama called for you.

962
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:46,130
Tell her I'm on my way.

963
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:46,960
Got it.

964
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,170
I'm returning this to you. I didn't use this at all.

965
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:56,760
Use this for when you escape with everyone.

966
01:15:57,190 --> 01:16:00,170
You! You were really planning to return here from the start!

967
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,440
I'm sorry, Ray.

968
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:06,920
If I run away, escaping will be even harder.

969
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:10,650
I can't afford to make a mistake.

970
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,160
So that not any one of you will die.

971
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,960
I've done everything that only I can do...

972
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:34,630
I will guarantee that your escape will be a success!

973
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:47,400
Thank you for everything you've done for me at this point.

974
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:52,570
I lived a good life all thanks to the two of you.

975
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:55,020
It was so much fun.

976
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,790
I had so much fun!

977
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:05,060
I was so happy!

978
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:11,180
Dammit!

979
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:18,720
Norman! You can still escape now! Let's escape together!

980
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:20,600
My feelings won't change.

981
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:23,750
You know that, don't you?

982
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:34,330
I'm off.

983
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,690
Well, then. Be well, everyone.

984
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,370
Take care of your health, Norman!

985
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:06,410
Thank you!

986
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:09,180
Eat you meals properly, okay?

987
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,480
Thank you!

988
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:14,000
I don't want to be separated from you.

989
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:18,900
Norman! I'll distract Mama. Please, run away.

990
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:24,000
You idiot! This isn't what you're supposed to do right now!

991
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:25,900
Shut up! No! I won't let you go!

992
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:31,410
Emma...

993
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:34,670
Understand what I'm feeling.

994
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:38,470
No! Those are the only feelings I won't accept!

995
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:46,050
The truth is... you want to live, right?

996
01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:59,770
I've had more than enough, Emma.

997
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:08,920
I can live on while smiling even with just those feelings you have in you.

998
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:15,320
It's time, Norman.

999
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:23,100
I know you are sad but please calm down.

1000
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:28,200
You weren't able to do anything. Making a fuss is futile.

1001
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:31,940
Alright!

1002
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,350
I leave Emma and Ray to you.

1003
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:03,150
I will write you a letter, as promised.

1004
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:06,070
You'll read it for me, right? Emma?

1005
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:23,350
It will be okay. Never give up, okay?

1006
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:01,170
Emma...

1007
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:07,890
That was admirable. You did the right thing.

1008
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:11,900
Now, I can finally ship Emma and Ray on term.

1009
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:14,490
"They lived a happy life in the House."

1010
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,430
That's right.

1011
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,750
They will lead blessed lives.

1012
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:22,560
Hey... were you happy, Mama?

1013
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:28,850
I am, because I met all of you.

1014
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:43,400
Well then, wait here.

1015
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,130
Did I startle you?

1016
01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:09,160
Could you be... Mr. Minerva?

1017
01:22:09,910 --> 01:22:12,730
You... actually know that name?

1018
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:18,760
Minerva... he disappeared.

1019
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:25,360
Then, you are?

1020
01:22:26,590 --> 01:22:29,510
I am the overseer who protects this world.

1021
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:34,710
You mean, the world where both humans and demons decided to make a promise?

1022
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:38,990
Yes. You really know a lot, huh?

1023
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:44,010
You mean, you're the overseer for the demons.

1024
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:47,730
I plan on doing this for the sake of the humans.

1025
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:54,620
The demons can only live on by eating human brains.

1026
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,290
That's why it's gravely important to develop smart brains.

1027
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:11,240
Thank you.

1028
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:20,620
Thanks to all of you, the humans from the other world can live in peace without any problems.

1029
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:24,850
I owe you my gratitude for being captured.

1030
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:34,220
Is there no one in the human world who could be our ally?

1031
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:38,050
There is.

1032
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:44,730
Aside from us, there are also humans who are trying to help human livestock.

1033
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:49,090
Is that so?

1034
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:50,470
But...

1035
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:54,200
They disappeared.

1036
01:23:56,660 --> 01:24:01,390
It's also my job to search for them and annihilate them.

1037
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:09,370
It's all lip-service. They're wolves in sheep's clothing.

1038
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:16,220
I can save this world by sacrificing someone else.

1039
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,140
Did I make you feel despair?

1040
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,120
No.

1041
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:42,910
I'm sure there's people in the human world who wants to save us.

1042
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:47,210
They will come in numbers. Even if you annihilate them, they will still come up one by one.

1043
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:48,830
Am I right?

1044
01:24:57,980 --> 01:25:00,450
There's still hope even with just that.

1045
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:02,570
Really?

1046
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,190
Yes.

1047
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:14,690
What an interesting kid you are.

1048
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:30,600
We hold hope that we can change the world.

1049
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,360
I'm absolutely sure we can change it.

1050
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,710
Alright!

1051
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,710
Let's play tag!

1052
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:54,870
I'm giving this to you.

1053
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:57,010
If you have to run away from here, then go.

1054
01:25:57,770 --> 01:25:59,230
It's impossible for me now.

1055
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:22,210
You poor thing.

1056
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:25,980
In the end, Norman died. Ray's in a pathetic situation.

1057
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,780
You can't do anything on your own.

1058
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,640
Your escape plan won't ever happen now.

1059
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:40,470
The best way to avoid being tormented by despair...

1060
01:26:42,450 --> 01:26:44,000
...is to resign yourself to fate.

1061
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:49,050
You're only hurting because you're trying to resist it. Accept it.

1062
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:56,060
You know what, Emma?

1063
01:26:56,890 --> 01:27:00,520
I'm thinking of recommending you as a Mom prospect.

1064
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:04,990
You can't change the world.

1065
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:10,270
If that's the case, then just do your best to survive in this world.

1066
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:20,650
Become a "Mama" and give up everything.

1067
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:40,880
I can't.

1068
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:44,990
Emma?

1069
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:09,790
Checkmate.

1070
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:08,410
Ray.

1071
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:11,330
It's your birthday tomorrow, right?

1072
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,400
Yeah.

1073
01:29:14,290 --> 01:29:17,380
I'm getting shipped out tomorrow, so...

1074
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:20,100
Today is the last night.

1075
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:22,470
I see.

1076
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:25,330
It's goodbye then?

1077
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:29,890
It is.

1078
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,200
Hey, you.

1079
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,170
Have you really given up for real?

1080
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:45,460
The truth is you haven't, Emma.

1081
01:29:56,050 --> 01:29:57,670
I haven't given up.

1082
01:29:58,630 --> 01:29:59,790
You too, right?

1083
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:02,730
Yeah.

1084
01:30:03,430 --> 01:30:07,260
In the end, we both had the same mindset.

1085
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:13,980
Let's escape, Ray. This is what I came here to tell you.

1086
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:19,110
Yeah. These past 2 months, we weren't able to talk properly.

1087
01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:21,980
Mama is stubborn.

1088
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:25,610
Even if we didn't do anything during those times, she was still watching us.

1089
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:29,430
That's why I used that to my advantage.

1090
01:30:30,730 --> 01:30:34,640
By keeping her eyes on me, I left the preparations to Don and Gilda.

1091
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:36,060
Alright, go!

1092
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:38,090
Okay, let's go! Go!

1093
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:39,300
Over here.

1094
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:44,280
Training with everyone. Gathering of tools and food
and cold-weather gear we need.

1095
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,060
Everything is done!

1096
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,220
Let's escape from this place tomorrow afternoon.

1097
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:48,910
No.

1098
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:53,710
We can't shake off Mama's surveillance,
so escaping by noon is impossible.

1099
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,130
I believe this is the best thing I can do.

1100
01:31:00,170 --> 01:31:02,680
I'm going to set this house on fire tonight!

1101
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,370
You'll spark a flame?

1102
01:31:05,470 --> 01:31:06,620
Move away.

1103
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,940
While Mama's distracted from putting it out, take that chance to escape.

1104
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:14,620
Headquarters will see it as an evacuation and not an escape.

1105
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:19,900
That way, we can avoid extra security at the bridge.
We'll take that chance to escape.

1106
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:25,660
But, what if Mama stops trying to extinguish the flames,
and starts going after us to protect her products?

1107
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,780
We can't get a chance to escape from that.

1108
01:31:27,950 --> 01:31:28,920
I know that.

1109
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:38,120
That's why I will stop Mama's advances.

1110
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:44,180
Ray!

1111
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:47,710
Isn't this the best?!

1112
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:51,380
A perfect scorer set to be shipped out starts flaming up!

1113
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,300
There's no way Mama can leave me alone!

1114
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:04,560
This is something I've decided since long ago.

1115
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:09,130
I've never even liked studying or reading at all.

1116
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:15,290
But I endured, I persevered, and got my scores up!

1117
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:18,710
I increased my value and made it all the way to the highest tier!

1118
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:24,420
But, I'll take that away from them tonight.

1119
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:28,500
Right before their long awaited harvest.

1120
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:32,790
Don't think you can eat me or feed me to anyone!

1121
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:39,860
Livestock? Produce? To hell with that!

1122
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:48,100
I'm human! Screw you all!

1123
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:49,890
Ray!

1124
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,930
Make sure you survive, Emma.

1125
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,130
Bye-bye.

1126
01:33:07,170 --> 01:33:09,100
Ray!

1127
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:15,270
Ray! Ray!

1128
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:19,770
Ray! Ray!

1129
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:21,550
Ray!

1130
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:22,570
Emma!

1131
01:33:22,590 --> 01:33:25,020
Mama! Ray! Help him!

1132
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:26,700
Ray got caught in it!

1133
01:33:26,730 --> 01:33:27,570
Ray?!

1134
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:35,130
Ray!

1135
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:36,730
What has he done?!

1136
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:43,100
Mama!

1137
01:33:43,130 --> 01:33:44,310
Take everyone outside! Please!

1138
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:44,900
Yes!

1139
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:50,170
Ray!

1140
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,400
Step back, Emma!

1141
01:34:07,290 --> 01:34:09,970
It's not working! I can't extinguish it.

1142
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:13,260
Emma! You need to hurry up and get away from here!

1143
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:19,270
Emma?

1144
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:29,000
Those children.. what were they wearing?

1145
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:36,700
There they are!

1146
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,970
It's Emma! Emma!

1147
01:34:39,070 --> 01:34:40,290
Emma!

1148
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:42,940
Thanks for waiting, everyone!

1149
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:45,290
Alright! Let's escape!

1150
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:46,960
Yeah!

1151
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:48,620
Here Emma!
-Thank you.

1152
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:50,390
Let's go!

1153
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:52,100
Alright! Now!

1154
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,380
Let's go, Ray.

1155
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:05,150
Norman figured it out.

1156
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:13,160
You---!

1157
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:18,720
This is Norman's message.

1158
01:35:20,110 --> 01:35:24,260
"I won't let you die right here! I'll show you something good. Just shut up and comply."

1159
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:25,080
What?

1160
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:28,070
I'm sorry, but I don't plan on letting you die.

1161
01:35:28,690 --> 01:35:29,720
Emma?

1162
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:34,980
I, Norman, and the kids won't ever let you die.

1163
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,740
Emma! We brought it!

1164
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:41,980
Thank you.

1165
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:43,860
Well then, get changed.

1166
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:46,850
Ray's substitute. Done.

1167
01:35:47,370 --> 01:35:51,310
That leaves the transmitter. Sit down and hand out your ear.

1168
01:35:57,490 --> 01:36:02,310
Alright. Let's get this started, Norman.

1169
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:17,830
To my dear friend, Emma.

1170
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:22,210
This letter contains the plan for here on in.

1171
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:26,080
Everything will probably happen before Ray's birthday.

1172
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:38,650
I've been caught by what Ray said that day...

1173
01:36:38,670 --> 01:36:41,760
All of this was so that you both may never get killed!

1174
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:45,090
Which means, he's not counting himself.

1175
01:36:45,110 --> 01:36:47,830
On top of that, he's been storing gas cans.

1176
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:51,460
Ray plans to light up a fire and die in it.

1177
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,210
Let's go!

1178
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:04,050
Make use of Ray's plans, outwit Mama, and take everyone with you to escape.

1179
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:08,990
Everything is going all according to Norman's plan.

1180
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:11,720
These guys, do they know the whole truth?

1181
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:13,440
Yeah, I told them everything.

1182
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:16,070
Checkmate.

1183
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:23,650
Everyone, there's something we need you to listen to.

1184
01:37:24,030 --> 01:37:25,650
It's something every important.

1185
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:27,600
What's it about?

1186
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:28,560
What for?

1187
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:32,710
So that's what it was.

1188
01:37:32,730 --> 01:37:34,850
Everything is Norman's strategy.

1189
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,610
Is this everyone?

1190
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:44,110
How about the little ones?

1191
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:46,840
We left the kids aged 4 and below.

1192
01:37:47,530 --> 01:37:50,250
But, it's not that we've given up on them.

1193
01:37:52,710 --> 01:37:54,140
I talked to Phil.

1194
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:56,850
I'll wait right here.

1195
01:37:57,180 --> 01:37:59,890
That's why, you can leave me here.

1196
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:07,480
I promise you. 2 years before you get scheduled on your shipment, I will definitely come back to you.

1197
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:13,430
They completely got me in.

1198
01:38:18,290 --> 01:38:20,300
But, you are all still alive.

1199
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:22,320
Emma and Ray!

1200
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:25,210
I won't let any one of you escape!

1201
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:33,630
Mama!

1202
01:38:34,850 --> 01:38:36,010
Phil...

1203
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:43,410
Where's Emma and the others? I'm scared, Mama!

1204
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,240
We're scared!
-You'll be fine!

1205
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:49,090
You'll be fine! It'll be okay!

1206
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:52,360
Mama will be back right away, so all of you wait here, okay?

1207
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:54,470
Mama, don't go!

1208
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,450
Don't go! Don't go!

1209
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:00,860
You can do it!

1210
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:03,610
Go, go!

1211
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:13,160
This is 73584 from Plant #3. There's been an escape! Sound the alarm!

1212
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:14,760
Intercept them when they reach the bridge!

1213
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,420
The alarm.

1214
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,130
It went off earlier than planned.

1215
01:39:28,690 --> 01:39:31,440
It doesn't matter if you kill the unexceptional ones.

1216
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:34,230
But don't ever hurt the topnotchers.

1217
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:36,810
What do we do? The bridge is still too far from here.

1218
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,790
That's fine. We were never planning on going across the bridge.

1219
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:45,400
Mama and the headquarters will think the same thing that you're escaping through the bridge.

1220
01:39:45,430 --> 01:39:48,650
It's not risk-free, but there's spots that will do.

1221
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:49,520
Let's go!

1222
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:50,700
Alright!

1223
01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:51,430
Let's go.

1224
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:54,930
It might be dangerous, but I found a spot that will do.

1225
01:39:57,190 --> 01:39:58,210
This is it!

1226
01:39:59,370 --> 01:40:01,280
This is where we cross to the other side.

1227
01:40:03,450 --> 01:40:04,270
Don!

1228
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:04,940
Got it!

1229
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:08,090
We're crossing from here?

1230
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:11,160
There we go!

1231
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:18,240
Alright!

1232
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:20,180
Yay!

1233
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:24,790
Don!

1234
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:25,520
Yeah!

1235
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:30,140
Alright! I'm going ahead!

1236
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:31,260
We're counting on you!

1237
01:40:31,290 --> 01:40:31,870
Yeah!

1238
01:40:43,130 --> 01:40:44,760
Made it!

1239
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:45,920
Alright!

1240
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:46,910
Nice one, Don!

1241
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:48,720
Let's go! Let's go!

1242
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:49,920
We're up next!

1243
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:52,560
Ready, go! Launch!

1244
01:40:56,470 --> 01:40:57,640
Alright!

1245
01:40:58,090 --> 01:41:00,680
Alright, everyone prepare. One by one!

1246
01:41:02,210 --> 01:41:03,370
Give me your hand.

1247
01:41:05,210 --> 01:41:06,360
Hold on tightly.

1248
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:07,190
Thank you.

1249
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:10,540
Ray!

1250
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:12,750
I'm going ahead!

1251
01:41:17,450 --> 01:41:19,530
Shouldn't you normally be scared?

1252
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:22,630
Let's go!

1253
01:41:23,390 --> 01:41:24,850
Ready, go!

1254
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:30,290
Just how much have they trained for this?

1255
01:41:31,510 --> 01:41:32,490
Ray!

1256
01:41:33,490 --> 01:41:37,440
Wouldn't this be the thing where Norman said he'll show you something good?

1257
01:41:43,490 --> 01:41:44,510
Alright!

1258
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,290
Here you are!

1259
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:49,940
Norman...

1260
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:54,490
Is it really okay... that I'm still alive?

1261
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:58,410
It's okay!

1262
01:42:00,150 --> 01:42:02,150
It's okay not to have given up!

1263
01:42:04,690 --> 01:42:06,120
Live on.

1264
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:07,350
Okay.

1265
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:09,840
Ready, go!

1266
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:11,630
You can do it!

1267
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:13,290
You got it, Sherry!

1268
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:15,350
You did well!

1269
01:42:17,710 --> 01:42:20,230
Never give up in believing others.

1270
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:23,960
No matter how implausible things gets, if it's Emma, I'm sure she can do it.

1271
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:40,380
The transmitters... aren't showing up.

1272
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,240
Could they have...

1273
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:50,900
Alright!

1274
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,290
Next is you, Gemima.

1275
01:42:54,450 --> 01:42:57,810
What should I do, Emma? My hands...

1276
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:01,590
I'm sorry.

1277
01:43:01,610 --> 01:43:04,610
I just keep thinking about what will happen if I fall.

1278
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:09,530
Gemima... you know what?

1279
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,770
It's alright!

1280
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:15,020
Let's cross together.

1281
01:43:18,730 --> 01:43:21,890
Tie the rope that you used to pull everyone up around me and Gemima.

1282
01:43:22,710 --> 01:43:23,830
Got it.

1283
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:27,260
Done!

1284
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:31,610
Alright, here we go. Gemima.

1285
01:43:34,390 --> 01:43:35,790
You can do it!

1286
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:41,690
Ready, go!

1287
01:43:46,830 --> 01:43:49,190
Alright! Next is you, Emma!

1288
01:44:00,430 --> 01:44:01,380
Mama.

1289
01:44:02,490 --> 01:44:04,010
Wait right there, Emma!

1290
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:16,510
I never imagined I'd be standing up here again.

1291
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:25,410
I also stood at this spot when I was the same age as you.

1292
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,780
I knew a boy named Leslie.

1293
01:44:32,220 --> 01:44:34,950
He was killed when he turned 16 years old on his birthday.

1294
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:38,260
My beloved Leslie.

1295
01:44:39,310 --> 01:44:44,550
After I learned the truth, I outwitted Mama and came here.

1296
01:44:46,290 --> 01:44:47,810
And then, I knew.

1297
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:53,030
A deep cliff. A dark forest.

1298
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:58,830
There was no place outside where I could live in.

1299
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:05,340
I was in so much despair that I gave up everything and aimed to become a "Mother."

1300
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:11,810
As the job entails, I had to look out after the children, and with the song that Leslie made...

1301
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:15,700
I sang that song as a lullaby and had the child in my womb hear it.

1302
01:45:17,530 --> 01:45:22,090
A song that only I and Leslie knew.

1303
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:28,550
What happened... to that child?

1304
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,460
He died right after he was born.

1305
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:43,840
I still vividly remember the day I got you in my arms.

1306
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:49,340
I thought, I wanted to become the best Mama there is.

1307
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:56,660
Living alongside with the children in this farm,
and provide all of you with so much love more than ever.

1308
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:01,950
If I could let all of you live for even one more year,
I wanted to create a happy time for all of you.

1309
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:10,510
There is no place outside where you can ever thrive in.

1310
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:12,440
You can't change the world.

1311
01:46:17,650 --> 01:46:19,620
If we can't, then we can just create one!

1312
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:22,730
A place where we can all live in!

1313
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:24,070
Emma!

1314
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:26,540
We don't know what what kind of a world there is out there.

1315
01:46:27,190 --> 01:46:30,250
I may not be able to go living on my own...

1316
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:36,070
But, I am not alone.

1317
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:52,230
I, together with everyone, will go to the outside world.

1318
01:46:55,550 --> 01:46:57,610
If you jump then I'll cut the rope.

1319
01:47:04,370 --> 01:47:05,480
Go ahead.

1320
01:47:07,990 --> 01:47:10,370
If that's what you want to do, I don't mind.

1321
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:14,980
I will still go, no matter what.

1322
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:16,650
Emma, you don't get it!

1323
01:47:19,540 --> 01:47:20,820
I do.

1324
01:47:22,970 --> 01:47:25,740
I was raised this way by you, Mama.

1325
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:33,540
Reading into the opponent's next moves.

1326
01:47:35,530 --> 01:47:37,900
You're the one who taught me that, Mama.

1327
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:39,140
Checkmate.

1328
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:46,720
You raised everyone with trust in the family,
you raised us all until we're back in good health.

1329
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:50,670
You did all of that, Mama.

1330
01:47:54,980 --> 01:47:57,440
For the purpose of getting high scores for the shipment.

1331
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:00,870
Is that really all to it?

1332
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:12,160
The truth is that, you're more than proud that your kids have crossed all the way over there.

1333
01:48:15,370 --> 01:48:16,850
You're wrong.

1334
01:48:18,590 --> 01:48:21,120
You want to change the world too, right? Mama?

1335
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:23,770
No.

1336
01:48:25,910 --> 01:48:32,000
The truth is that... you really want to see us all grown up, don't you?

1337
01:48:33,410 --> 01:48:34,480
No!

1338
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:48,220
Farewell.

1339
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:54,480
Mama.

1340
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:35,180
Let's go.

1341
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:59,230
Be well.

1342
01:50:01,850 --> 01:50:04,340
If the world will permit it, I sincerely hope you all find a light...

1343
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:07,450
...in the end of the tunnel.

1344
01:50:19,890 --> 01:50:20,900
Ray?

1345
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:24,970
Where did you hear that song?

1346
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:27,970
I heard it from inside your womb, Mama.

1347
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:34,780
I have memories of when I was born.

1348
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,900
You know this song too, Mama.

1349
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:59,150
I don't.

1350
01:51:05,530 --> 01:51:10,280
Listen... I already figured out the house's secret.

1351
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:13,420
Mama!

1352
01:51:14,010 --> 01:51:15,760
It's Mama!

1353
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,390
Everyone, it's Mama!

1354
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:18,550
Everyone!

1355
01:51:18,570 --> 01:51:19,770
Mama!

1356
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:21,330
Mama!

1357
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:24,090
I am so sorry, everyone.

1358
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:25,490
Mama!

1359
01:51:26,710 --> 01:51:29,520
Mama!

1360
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:31,300
Mama!

1361
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:33,950
73584.

1362
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:36,220
Report to us.

1363
01:51:46,230 --> 01:51:49,570
Are you okay?

1364
01:51:52,330 --> 01:51:53,420
Look at this.

1365
01:51:56,740 --> 01:51:58,060
It's Norman!

1366
01:52:04,870 --> 01:52:08,740
Norman... he's smiling, right?

1367
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:13,620
Everyone, take a look at this!

1368
01:52:15,780 --> 01:52:18,870
This is the pen that Norman left for us.

1369
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:27,170
This owl... isn't this Minerva's?

1370
01:52:35,310 --> 01:52:36,940
It flew!

1371
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:41,530
No way! It flew!

1372
01:52:41,930 --> 01:52:42,970
Let's go!

1373
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:45,900
Alright!

1374
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,960
Let's go!

1375
01:52:48,340 --> 01:52:49,880
Alright, let's get going!

1376
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:50,790
Let's go!

1377
01:52:51,610 --> 01:52:52,470
Be careful.

1378
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:04,000
I take full responsibility for everything that happened.

1379
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:42,840
We're finally outside!

1380
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:54,720
The morning sun.

1381
01:54:09,150 --> 01:54:11,290
Emma, what can you see over there?

1382
01:54:31,820 --> 01:54:37,050

[T/N: This is the most perfect live adaptation I've seen in a long time!
I hope they create a part 2 for this film! One that doesn't follow S2, of course *wink*]
