What are you thinking about?

3
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:25,421
Nothing.

4
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,653
Liar! Come on, what?

5
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,627
About you.

6
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,297
Really?

7
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:38,094
Are you really thinking about me?

8
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,433
When can we really...

9
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,609
Wait.

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,340
I've got something to do first.

11
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:52,780
What?

12
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,149
It doesn't matter.
It just concerns me.

13
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:03,622
What? What is it?
What are you thinking about?

32
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,519
You here on business?

33
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,922
For the new weather station?

34
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,020
Seafood?

35
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,992
No. I'm looking.

36
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,624
Looking for someone?

37
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,660
Hey!

38
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,335
Got somewhere to stay?

39
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:58,969
No.

40
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:04,300
My sister and her husband
run an inn. How about there?

41
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,844
It's convenient. Right in town.

42
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,211
It's good to see a new face.

43
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:15,679
A typhoon wrecked the pier,
and who knows when they'll fix it.

44
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,923
We're back to boats again.

45
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,158
This island never changes.

46
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,789
No. It's changed a lot.

47
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:27,730
So you've been here before?

48
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,735
Yeah. A long time ago.

49
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,011
I run boats for a living.
What do you do?

50
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,281
I sell sewing machines.

51
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,010
Yeah?

52
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,847
You've come a long way.

53
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,018
You said you were looking
for someone...

54
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,115
Yes. I am.

55
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,918
A friend?

56
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,761
His name's Otake.

57
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,628
What does he do?

58
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,001
I don't know.

59
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,763
Is he from around here?

60
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:11,500
I came from Niijima Island
after the war... 15 or 16 years ago.

61
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,969
He was here before that.

62
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,945
So you're looking for him?

63
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,380
Yeah. For him.

64
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:20,980
And one other man.

65
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,315
Another one?

66
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,735
What's this?

67
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,875
Oh, Mr Nomoto...

68
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,976
What's going on?

69
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,715
Him and his friends...

70
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:01,260
...jumped a guard and escaped
from the reform school.

71
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,587
How many of them?

72
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,728
There's three more.
He's the only one we got.

73
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,494
Why would you do that?

74
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:12,029
You can't get off this island
in winter.

75
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:16,938
There's nowhere to hide
on this island, either.

76
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,371
They'll come out when
they get hungry...

77
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:26,341
...but we can't just wait for the police,
so everyone's helping out.

78
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,711
And you're a Public Safety Officer.

79
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:35,720
You help, too.
This concerns all of us.

80
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,890
I wonder where they're hiding...

81
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:46,194
I'm too busy to be out hunting
right now!

82
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,446
Is that man's name Matsui?

83
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,952
Yes. Do you know him?

84
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,325
From years ago?

85
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,621
Yeah. Years ago.

86
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,566
Go on, eat it! It's good!

87
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:50,294
No!

88
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,838
You're not scared, are you?
Go on!

89
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:09,345
You little bastard!

90
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:10,009
Are you going to try selling
over on Kojima. too?

91
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,614
I suppose if they're manual
and don't need electricity...

92
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:20,890
But who'd sew pretty clothes
and wear them on that island?

93
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,863
Has it changed there, too?

94
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:30,632
No. A little bit of wind,
and it's still completely cut off.

95
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,900
They used to send boys over there.

96
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,403
They did?

97
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:40,942
The ones who were too much
for the reform school here to handle.

98
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:48,046
They won't send those runaways
over there, will they?

99
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,979
I doubt it.

100
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:54,054
There's a grade school there,
but that's all I know.

101
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,066
Hello!

102
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:55,344
I brought you a guest.
You've got room, don't you?

103
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,188
Thank you.

104
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:03,019
We've got a room, but the floor mats
are being changed. Could he wait?

105
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,122
Welcome.

106
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,394
How about a bath first?

107
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,096
Well! Mr Kuroki!

108
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,104
What brings you here?

109
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:25,082
Something came up, and now
with this storm I can't get back.

110
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,077
Staying the night?

111
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,714
Yeah, I thought I'd drink
with the landlord.

112
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:32,813
Join us.

113
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,128
You're with someone?

114
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,563
He's a guest I brought.

115
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:46,462
I was at Niijima.
I hear some kids have run away?

116
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:51,100
Yeah. Everyone's all worked up.
They've got guns and everything!

117
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,408
They're nothing but trouble!
They should send the lot to Kojima.

118
00:11:55,514 --> 00:12:00,611
Don't make jokes! We don't want
kids like that on Kojima!

119
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:07,921
But didn't they used to send
boys over there?

120
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,162
Did they?

121
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,426
That's what he says.

122
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,902
He says he's been there.

123
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:32,341
I'll get the bath ready.
You can sit here.

124
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:01,042
Mr Kuroki's principal
of the Kojima school.

125
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:05,274
He's from Tokyo... I think...

126
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,985
He sells sewing machines.

127
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,748
I'm Nishihara.

128
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,652
Kuroki. Glad to meet you.

129
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,659
You used to live here?

130
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,061
For a little while.

131
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,396
I see.

132
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:27,001
As a matter of fact, I have
the feeling I've seen you before.

133
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:27,867
Oh yeah?

134
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:32,842
There's so few people on Kojima
we feel like that about everyone.

135
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,173
You're a teacher?

136
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,011
I run the combined
primary and middle school.

137
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,814
Come and see us
if you come to Kojima.

138
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:47,591
You said you're looking for someone,
didn't you.

139
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,558
What was the name?

140
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,098
'Ota' something... 'Otake', was it?

141
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,499
There's an 'Otake' who lives
on Kojima.

142
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:05,943
I'd have to see him.
He used to live on this island.

143
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,807
He's lived on Kojima
for years and years.

144
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,413
I don't know him.

145
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,281
You might not.

146
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:18,049
He hardly ever comes here.

147
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:22,057
He avoids people.
A real eccentric.

148
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,554
He is?

149
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,162
Yeah.

150
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:31,595
A madman, but a genius, maybe.

151
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,796
A genius?

152
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:38,308
Well, yeah, in some ways.

153
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,746
He's a man of foresight,
like a prophet.

154
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,544
But he's headstrong.

155
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:50,246
He hates interference.
so he keeps away from everyone.

156
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,450
But he's got a head for business.

157
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,188
He succeeds where everyone else fails.

158
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:03,666
When camellia oil was cheap,
he planted trees.

159
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,000
Two years later. he made money.

160
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:11,331
He made the first kayak around here.

161
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:16,113
When fishing was bad,
he made money on lobsters with it.

162
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,315
He makes butter, grows tea...

163
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:24,446
He makes them his own way,
but he won't tell anyone how.

164
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:25,716
Butter?

165
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,159
He's got the only cattle on Kojima.

166
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,354
Cows? On Kojima?

167
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,928
Yeah!

168
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,994
Cattle... I herded cattle there...

169
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:55,520
I wonder what he's like... he sounds
too smart to be an islander.

170
00:15:55,621 --> 00:16:00,581
Yeah... he came from Tokyo
during the war.

171
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,890
Are you a friend of his?

172
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,089
Me? Why?

173
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:10,732
He's a gloomy man, who hardly
even speaks when you meet him.

174
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,097
Does anyone work for him?

175
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,900
No, he's all alone.

176
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,773
His daughter comes over here
to buy provisions.

177
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,243
She's the only thing in the world
he cares for.

178
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:25,142
She's very pretty.

179
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,918
But only her.
He won't even keep a cat.

180
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,989
I came over here with her.

181
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:38,892
She can't go back in this wind.
I'm sure he'll be worried.

182
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,558
But as you were saying...

183
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,534
Or was it this gentleman?

184
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:51,106
During the war, Otake worked boys
the reform school here couldn't handle.

185
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:56,842
He treated them more like cattle
than farm labor.

186
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,510
Sure, they were bad kids,
but they were still kids.

187
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:07,819
He's a brute, that Otake.

188
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:15,458
There was a notorious killer named
Kinjiro exiled there in feudal times.

189
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:21,570
When the men were away, he killed
all the women and burned the village.

190
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:30,574
But now they worship him as one of
the island gods. That's Kojima for you.

191
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,248
Otake was exiled there, too?

192
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,149
He might have been.

193
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:49,396
What happened to the boys sent there?

194
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:55,669
I don't know. I wasn't there long
that time.

195
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,937
You were teaching then?

196
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:02,343
I was still a probationary teacher.

197
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,282
Did any of the boys ever die there?

198
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,578
Die?

199
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:13,520
I remember there was a rumor...

200
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:17,527
...that a boy had been killed.
or maybe 'spirited away'.

201
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,889
It was during the war.
so it would have been hushed up.

202
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,201
'Hushed up'?

203
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,300
And you didn't check...

204
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,205
Why would I?

205
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:35,871
This boy who was 'spirited away'...
hadn't he been enslaved there?

206
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,250
No!... well, I don't know.

207
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:50,290
The bath is ready.
I'll have your room prepared.

208
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,292
The workmen are done.

209
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:57,362
Take a bath. It'll refresh you.

210
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,901
I'll take your things.

211
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,611
I've seen that man before.

212
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,653
He says he was on the island...

213
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,481
This one?

214
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:48,076
Could you take his bag
to the Pine Room?

215
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,761
Something wrong?

216
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,465
Can I take a bath when he's done?

217
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:48,337
Mr Kuroki, are you sure
you remember him?

218
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:55,414
I thought so at first,
but I can't place him.

219
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,819
Listen...

220
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,689
Is there a boat tonight?

221
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,424
Tonight? Impossible.

222
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:13,734
Even if it clears up, how could you
land on Kojima in this wind?

223
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,869
I'm used to wind.

224
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,100
I can't even get the boat out
in these waves!

225
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,674
So when?

226
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,416
Another day or two.

227
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,520
What's your hurry?

228
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,586
Your boyfriend waiting?

229
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,687
Will you try it tomorrow?

230
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,457
It depends on the weather.

231
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,896
Come back and see. but I doubt it.

232
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:50,199
For the mainland I'd risk it,
but not Kojima.

233
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,362
Hey, Aya!

234
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:24,007
Where are you off to?

235
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,734
None of your business!

236
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,714
There's no boat.
Your dad'll be worried.

237
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,974
So I'm going.

238
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,606
How?

239
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,218
Hop in.
We'll drive you to town.

240
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:37,219
No!

241
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,486
Why not? I'll bet your old man
didn't give you much money.

242
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,789
You can stay at my place.

243
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,459
Forget it!

244
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,930
Stubborn as her old man!

245
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:54,904
Anyway, get in. I can't leave you
alone out here.

246
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,237
What's wrong?

247
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,447
Did you think over what I said?

248
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,613
It's not such a bad deal.

249
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,719
I won't be here forever.

250
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:15,186
Do you want to rot on Kojima
with your dad?

251
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,091
Who'd ever want to be with you?

252
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,326
Where do you think you are?
This isn't Kojima.

253
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:27,001
I could do anything I wanted
with you right now.

254
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,938
There's only Tsuneki here.

255
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,067
Stop!

256
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,075
Shoot.

257
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:42,979
Do anything to me and my father
tells the world your secret.

258
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,519
That's what he said.

259
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,352
But your father...

260
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:52,591
What about my father? Tell me!

261
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:58,102
When you get home you tell him...

262
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,705
...I give as good as I get.

263
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,044
Don't move!

264
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,813
She's a lot of trouble.

265
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,649
You want me to grab her for you?

266
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,619
Shut up!

267
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:22,124
She's too pretty to leave on Kojima!

268
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,161
She used to be so meek and mild...

269
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,459
But she's gorgeous!

270
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,405
Thanks. The bath was great.

271
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,475
Your room's to the right
at the end of the hall.

272
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,432
It can't be!

273
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,362
What?

274
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,494
Nothing.

275
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,874
Do you remember?

276
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:11,941
No.

277
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,772
It can't be!

278
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:27,013
Please! I'm asking you to go back!

279
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,025
I know I'm a teacher,
but I can't let you stay.

280
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:35,763
You've got to go back
and apologize to Otake!

281
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:47,207
Sabo, wait!
Where are you going?!

282
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,745
The poor boy!

283
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:56,776
We can't hide him here.

284
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,650
Otake'd find him for sure.

285
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,724
They'll beat him to death!

286
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:06,794
What can I do about it?!

287
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,895
He came here because
you were good to him!

288
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,162
What can I do?!

289
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,905
Nothing!

290
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,804
I don't want to get involved.

291
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,541
Then why did you?

292
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,819
Has Sabo been here?

293
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,894
No, he hasn't.

294
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:43,328
There's no point in hiding him.
He's not worth a dog's life.

295
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:48,103
He's not here. Search if you like.

296
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:13,026
You're sure you're not hiding him,
Teacher?

297
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,493
No.

298
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:17,795
What did he do?!

299
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,802
He ran away again.

300
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,064
Mr Otake!

301
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,068
He dropped this!

302
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,373
He's going to take the kayak!

303
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:33,473
Fine! One boy can't handle that.

304
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:34,585
Wait!

305
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,879
What?

306
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,049
What will you do?

307
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,282
Whatever I like.

308
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,787
He was in your car?

309
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,426
I guess I didn't notice him.

310
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,260
He knows you, all right.
He said your name.

311
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,492
My name?

312
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:26,601
As if he knew you years ago.

313
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,433
Mr Nomoto...

314
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,708
...you're sure about the knife?

315
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:37,846
Yeah. I saw it when
his bag fell open.

316
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,608
Sounds like fun!

317
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,775
'Fun'?

318
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,619
What's he want here?

319
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,622
He sells sewing machines.

320
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:50,817
Mr Kuroki, the principal at Kojima.
says he's seen him before.

321
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,522
He just can't quite place him.

322
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,726
The guy made him nervous.

323
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,562
Does it have anything to do with
those runaways?

324
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,472
Impossible!

325
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,508
It's not strange for a man
to have a knife.

326
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,004
What else did he say?

327
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,981
Just that he's looking for someone.

328
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,315
Oh, yeah... a man named Otake.

329
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,019
That was the name.

330
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:24,851
Mr Kuroki says there's a strange man
by that name on Kojima.

331
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,926
He's not 'strange'. He's crazy.

332
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,060
Is this guy looking for Otake?

333
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:39,042
I don't know. He said
he was going over there.

334
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,711
Hmm...

335
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,617
Should I go see him?

336
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:51,586
Maybe he's after
the Weather Bureau contract.

337
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,680
I don't like it.

338
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:58,053
Is he staying at your sister's place?

339
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:02,633
Yeah. I didn't like the sight of
that knife one bit.

340
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,567
Thanks.

341
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,969
Go see if the guy's in his room.

342
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:18,046
Missus! More sake!

343
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:23,049
You've had more than enough
Mr Kuroki. You're drunk!

344
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:28,125
Don't worry. This wind
won't go down tomorrow.

345
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,952
It's been a while
since I could take things easy.

346
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:37,430
Surely you're not too busy
on a little island like Kojima...

347
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:43,508
It's easy work. but I've got
an invalid for a wife!

348
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:48,278
Is your wife still sick?

349
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:51,982
'Still'? She'll never get better now.

350
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:58,114
It's palsy. She'll be bedridden
till she dies.

351
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,322
But she's so young!

352
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:08,359
All the children loved her
when she was teaching here.

353
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:13,666
She was always so nice,
and kind to everyone...

354
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,206
Sabo!

355
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:21,972
It can't be... it just can't be!

356
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,841
What are you doing?! Stop it!

357
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,653
What are you going to do with him?!
He's just a boy!

358
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,382
Boy or not, he's mine!

359
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,792
You would've killed him
if I hadn't passed by!

360
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:44,796
You're a father, too!
Think of his parents!

361
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,003
Move.

362
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,382
Out of the way!

363
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:06,715
Brute! You stop that, or I'll go
to the big island and report you!

364
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:15,158
He can't work like this.
He stays here till he's well.

365
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:20,366
All right. Keep him for me. then.

366
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,163
I'll come back when he's better.

367
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,917
Let's go home.

368
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,674
Have some tea.

369
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,075
Why won't you sit here?

370
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,306
Akie!

371
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:14,048
How long is he staying?

372
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:20,554
How much older is he
than the children you teach?

373
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,599
There's lots more to eat.

374
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,508
It's me.

375
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:42,237
He hasn't been out at all?
You're sure?

376
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,510
Yeah. The woman from the inn
says he's stayed shut up in his room.

377
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:51,745
Shut up in his room?
Who is he, anyway?

378
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,687
Is there something wrong?

379
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:54,550
No.

380
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,718
If he's got a knife,
we should do something.

381
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:00,990
We should strike first.

382
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,429
I'll hit his room.

383
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,798
No, I'll go. You get out of there.

384
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,750
Matsui?

385
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:27,491
Mr Kuroki! Are you staying here?

386
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,853
Yeah.

387
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,486
Have you seen...

388
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,037
Did you see the guy?

389
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,263
Who?

390
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:46,335
It's Sabo. He's back.

391
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,380
Sabo, from Kojima!

392
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:54,016
Saburo? Impossible!

393
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,086
It's true. He's alive!

394
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,512
It's Saburo. I saw him.

395
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,451
It can't be!

396
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:07,895
It's hard to believe. but it's Saburo,
all right. He didn't die.

397
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,534
Saburo's come back? The bastard!

398
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:20,233
Mr Kuroki... he's got a knife.

399
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:24,376
Nomoto says he's coming
to see me with it.

400
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,144
He's after Otake. too.

401
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,814
Why, after all this time?

402
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,750
'Why'?

403
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:41,498
He's got good reason.

404
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,166
So he's alive. is he...

405
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:51,471
Don't tell him you saw me, all right?

406
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,470
I haven't called him by name.

407
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:59,343
That's wise. He might have
a score to settle with you, too.

408
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,572
Is this where the Kojima boat leaves?

409
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,172
Yes.

410
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:35,613
Are you going there?

411
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:40,824
There's nothing to see but the graves
of people exiled there.

412
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,290
Otake's there. isn't he?

413
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,757
What do you want with him?

414
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:55,132
If you've got business with him,
that's his daughter over there.

415
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,241
That's Aya?

416
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,539
Do you know her?

417
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:07,077
You wouldn't happen to be...

418
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,545
I'm Sabo.

419
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:15,856
You knew that, and you still kept quiet.
You haven't changed a bit.

420
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,755
Why do you have to ask?

421
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,864
Shut up and watch.

422
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:25,860
Are you here after Otake and Matsui?

423
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,300
How's your wife?

424
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,963
She's bedridden with palsy.

425
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:33,770
I see... I've never forgotten
the taste of her rice...

426
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:36,539
But why are you here?

427
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,099
Thank you.

428
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,476
It's a good view of Kojima,
but it's dangerous here.

429
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,512
Didn't you know about
the runaways?

430
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:23,382
So why are you here?

431
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,550
To look at Kojima.

432
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,389
This is the closest place to it.

433
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,354
I used to stand over there.

434
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,857
On a calm day, it looked as if
I could walk across.

435
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,590
Were you on Kojima?

436
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:38,633
Yeah.

437
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,827
When?

438
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,529
When you were about this high.

439
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,476
Do you know me? Or my father?

440
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,874
Mr Otake.

441
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:51,707
You know him?

442
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,317
Yes. I do.

443
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,257
Why did you leave?
You don't live around here now.

444
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,415
No.

445
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,827
Are you so anxious to get back?

446
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,825
Is it such a good place?

447
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,266
My father's there.

448
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,401
I see.

449
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,774
Why did you come back?
Are you going to Kojima, too?

450
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,174
Yeah. I've got something to do.

451
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,335
What?

452
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,778
You'll find out.

453
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:30,549
I see... well, come to our house.

454
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,350
My father will thank you
for helping me.

455
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,790
That doesn't concern him.

456
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,096
But if he'd been here just now...

457
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:43,064
He would have killed them.

458
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,564
Your father dotes on you,
doesn't he.

459
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,318
You're all grown up.

460
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,059
When did you know me?

461
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,331
When you were about this high.

462
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:21,399
He took you in a basket
everywhere he went.

463
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,670
Did you play with me?

464
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:25,672
Yes. I did.

465
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,778
You'd better go.

466
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:37,112
They went the other way.
The way you came is safe.

467
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:39,953
Thank you. I'll see you on Kojima.

468
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,251
Yes.

469
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:35,525
We just missed them!
I was sure we had them!

470
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:38,433
Now we know where they are.

471
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,393
We'll get them tomorrow.

472
00:44:40,937 --> 00:44:42,871
I thought I'd hit one of them...

473
00:44:43,006 --> 00:44:45,201
Where's the jeep?

474
00:44:45,341 --> 00:44:46,774
Over here.

475
00:44:58,388 --> 00:45:00,652
Get anything?

476
00:45:01,624 --> 00:45:04,718
So you've graduated
to hunting people now...

477
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,162
So it's you, Saburo...

478
00:45:21,044 --> 00:45:22,341
You're alive...

479
00:45:22,478 --> 00:45:24,639
Yeah.

480
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,110
Son of a bitch!

481
00:45:35,158 --> 00:45:36,352
What do you want?

482
00:45:37,226 --> 00:45:39,091
Am I fair game, too?

483
00:45:40,063 --> 00:45:42,691
Don't just stand there. Hop in.

484
00:45:43,733 --> 00:45:47,294
It's been a long time.
Let's have a chat somewhere.

485
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:52,330
OK. if you say so.

486
00:46:22,605 --> 00:46:23,594
What's the idea?!

487
00:46:30,046 --> 00:46:32,480
Throw the gun away!

488
00:46:33,049 --> 00:46:35,813
I'll drive us right off the cliff!

489
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:37,677
Get rid of it!

490
00:46:56,906 --> 00:46:59,841
Get out. Let's talk about old times.

491
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,314
I decided when I came
we'd have our talk here.

492
00:47:10,586 --> 00:47:11,883
Talk about what?

493
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:14,787
Things.

494
00:47:15,491 --> 00:47:20,929
Let's start with why they think
I'm dead over on that island.

495
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:24,528
Then I'll tell you why I'm not.

496
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,401
I didn't do it! It was Otake!

497
00:47:28,504 --> 00:47:31,905
Yeah, but you watched it.

498
00:47:32,508 --> 00:47:35,204
Who made him want to kill me?

499
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,579
It may have been
just a game to you...

500
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:45,783
...but I remember it every time
I look down at the sea.

501
00:47:53,696 --> 00:47:54,754
Who's this?

502
00:47:58,301 --> 00:47:59,893
Sabo...

503
00:48:10,646 --> 00:48:11,840
Come here.

504
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,108
Come here!

505
00:48:23,826 --> 00:48:28,763
So you've been stealing my butter,
have you?

506
00:48:28,898 --> 00:48:33,164
No! Matsui pushed a moray eel
into my mouth!

507
00:48:50,286 --> 00:48:51,878
Let's see you run!

508
00:48:53,856 --> 00:48:55,619
You're an exile, too!

509
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:58,116
You've been left here to rot!

510
00:48:58,261 --> 00:49:02,027
Are you talking back to me?!

511
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:51,500
Get out!

512
00:51:59,542 --> 00:52:02,807
I'll do anything you want!

513
00:52:03,212 --> 00:52:06,238
I was a bastard, I know!

514
00:52:06,382 --> 00:52:09,476
I try to forget
all about that island!

515
00:52:09,618 --> 00:52:13,054
Oh yeah? I never want to forget!

516
00:52:14,924 --> 00:52:17,119
Forgive me! Please!

517
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:31,031
I'll give you half my business!

518
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,204
Please!

519
00:52:49,325 --> 00:52:54,092
You just stood there and watched!
You were all having a great time!

520
00:52:54,263 --> 00:52:58,859
It was you who said to run,
then went and told Otake!

521
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:04,564
What do you want me to do?!

522
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:07,105
Feel my pain.

523
00:53:17,286 --> 00:53:19,652
Forgive me, Sabo!

524
00:53:42,378 --> 00:53:46,007
Where on the island are you going?

525
00:53:46,148 --> 00:53:47,172
Ashura-ga-hara.

526
00:53:47,316 --> 00:53:51,946
Ashura-ga-hara?
There's nothing there but cows!

527
00:53:52,088 --> 00:53:53,077
Are they still there?

528
00:53:53,222 --> 00:53:55,520
You're going to see cows?

529
00:53:56,392 --> 00:53:58,690
No. A certain man.

530
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:01,689
Then come to our house. too.

531
00:54:03,232 --> 00:54:06,895
You can stay at the school.
In the staff room.

532
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:09,402
Or even at my house.

533
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,267
He's your guest. Mr Kuroki?

534
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:39,720
Goodbye. I live on the other side
of the island.

535
00:55:41,564 --> 00:55:47,332
She and her father live alone in
the most isolated place on the island.

536
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,993
Over the mountain?

537
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:52,073
Yeah, but it's a hard road.

538
00:55:52,374 --> 00:55:54,569
About two hours' walk.

539
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,803
It's real steep.

540
00:56:00,015 --> 00:56:02,006
She was only this high...

541
00:56:13,562 --> 00:56:19,523
The exiles used to try and swim
from there... they all drowned.

542
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:23,362
It's over two miles,
and the current's strong.

543
00:56:26,609 --> 00:56:30,375
It's changed... all thatls the same
are the sea and...

544
00:57:03,078 --> 00:57:04,705
It's Sabo!

545
00:57:06,115 --> 00:57:10,677
He's alive, and he's come back!

546
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:18,117
To do what?
Why did you come back?

547
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:24,998
You were very good to me,
Mrs Kuroki.

548
00:57:28,003 --> 00:57:33,270
What did you come back to do
here on Kojima?

549
00:58:26,061 --> 00:58:30,395
You can't let him go. you know.

550
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:38,899
I understand why he hates Otake
enough to kill him. but...

551
00:58:39,508 --> 00:58:46,812
...you can't let him go!
You can't let him do it!

552
00:58:47,316 --> 00:58:54,984
What can I do about it?
There's nothing I can do.

553
00:58:55,090 --> 00:59:01,256
Don't let him go!
You mustn't!

554
00:59:30,726 --> 00:59:31,954
What's wrong?

555
00:59:40,068 --> 00:59:41,626
You're up early.

556
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:50,644
An old habits come back. When I was
here, I had to get up before dawn.

557
00:59:51,914 --> 00:59:57,318
I'd look across at the big island,
but it never got any closer.

558
01:00:01,457 --> 01:00:04,255
Look. The sun's coming up.

559
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:09,754
The same sun over the same sea...
it's a strange feeling.

560
01:00:09,932 --> 01:00:12,526
Twenty years... it feels like yesterday.

561
01:00:12,634 --> 01:00:15,694
No... as if I've never been away.

562
01:00:15,804 --> 01:00:21,333
So you're going to Ashura-ga-hara
to see Otake today?

563
01:00:21,477 --> 01:00:22,876
So what?

564
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:27,541
You're better off not to.
He's changed.

565
01:00:27,683 --> 01:00:30,208
The sun and the sea haven't.

566
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:32,281
Sabo!

567
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:36,687
Don't call me that! Sabo is dead!

568
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:39,684
I'm no concern of yours now.

569
01:00:41,029 --> 01:00:46,262
Anyway. there's someone else
I want to see besides Otake.

570
01:00:47,336 --> 01:00:50,100
Someone else? Who?

571
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:51,766
It doesn't matter.

572
01:00:52,007 --> 01:00:55,704
Sabo wasn't your problem, anyway.

573
01:00:56,044 --> 01:00:57,375
Isn't that right?

574
01:00:57,513 --> 01:01:02,109
Just stand by and watch,
the way you always did.

575
01:01:02,651 --> 01:01:04,881
There's nothing you can do!

576
01:01:06,388 --> 01:01:08,788
Sab... mister!

577
01:01:09,691 --> 01:01:12,319
The path's still the same?

578
01:01:16,999 --> 01:01:18,057
Sabo!

579
01:01:19,735 --> 01:01:20,895
Sabo!

580
01:03:07,509 --> 01:03:09,500
Hey!

581
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:14,712
I saw you coming.
I brought the goats out to graze.

582
01:03:19,321 --> 01:03:20,618
Are you coming to our place?

583
01:03:20,756 --> 01:03:24,590
Yeah... so this is Ashura-ga-hara...

584
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:26,519
Yes.

585
01:03:28,797 --> 01:03:30,458
Have you been here before?

586
01:03:30,832 --> 01:03:31,764
Yeah.

587
01:03:32,668 --> 01:03:34,192
Why?

588
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:38,431
I tended cattle. Goats, too.

589
01:03:44,346 --> 01:03:45,711
Is your dad home?

590
01:03:46,181 --> 01:03:48,445
Yes. I told him about you.

591
01:03:49,017 --> 01:03:49,676
Me?

592
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:52,253
About how you saved me.

593
01:03:53,155 --> 01:03:54,281
Oh.

594
01:03:57,159 --> 01:03:59,127
Well, since you're here...

595
01:04:00,495 --> 01:04:02,986
Don't be surprised by my father.

596
01:04:27,923 --> 01:04:29,117
Dad!

597
01:04:31,259 --> 01:04:33,489
He'll be right back.
He left his work out.

598
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:41,969
What?

599
01:04:43,305 --> 01:04:44,203
Nothing.

600
01:04:46,408 --> 01:04:48,467
There's no one else here?

601
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:49,838
Who?

602
01:04:51,113 --> 01:04:53,673
Workers, tenants...

603
01:04:53,915 --> 01:04:55,007
No.

604
01:04:56,251 --> 01:04:57,718
Who tends the animals?

605
01:04:57,986 --> 01:04:59,578
Dad and me.

606
01:05:28,784 --> 01:05:31,446
Who said you could come in?!

607
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:38,421
I won't have it!

608
01:05:38,794 --> 01:05:42,093
I told you, Dad!
This is the man who helped me!

609
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:44,831
Hello.

610
01:05:48,436 --> 01:05:50,597
My damn daughter...

611
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,048
You want something?

612
01:06:10,225 --> 01:06:16,630
Y es. I'd like to buy some land here...
to grow camellias.

613
01:06:17,332 --> 01:06:19,300
I don't sell land.

614
01:06:25,974 --> 01:06:28,204
If that's all, you can go.

615
01:06:28,343 --> 01:06:29,571
Dad!

616
01:06:34,382 --> 01:06:35,349
What's this?

617
01:06:35,517 --> 01:06:37,348
An exile carved it.

618
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:39,920
It's very well made.

619
01:06:40,856 --> 01:06:44,849
No! I'm not selling any land!
Get out!

620
01:06:47,929 --> 01:06:54,198
Mr Otake, I wanted to ask you
about something other than land.

621
01:06:55,337 --> 01:07:00,639
You had hired men working for you
during the war, didn't you?

622
01:07:01,676 --> 01:07:03,200
Go away!

623
01:07:14,222 --> 01:07:17,589
I say 'hired men', but they were kids...

624
01:07:18,193 --> 01:07:21,321
...sent over from the reform school
on the big island.

625
01:07:23,732 --> 01:07:25,495
Were they?

626
01:07:27,269 --> 01:07:28,896
Have you forgotten?

627
01:07:29,871 --> 01:07:33,807
One named Matsui? He runs a business
on the big island.

628
01:07:33,942 --> 01:07:35,500
That Matsui?

629
01:07:41,249 --> 01:07:45,242
And a boy named Nishihara
who was here with him?

630
01:07:46,554 --> 01:07:50,012
Saburo Nishihara...
they called him 'Sabo'.

631
01:07:54,829 --> 01:07:57,889
You don't remember him?

632
01:08:01,102 --> 01:08:02,592
No.

633
01:08:05,907 --> 01:08:06,771
You forget?

634
01:08:06,908 --> 01:08:11,607
No. I'm not a man who forgets names.

635
01:08:12,981 --> 01:08:15,074
There might have been a Matsui...

636
01:08:16,084 --> 01:08:21,681
You've forgotten. He died here
while he was working for you.

637
01:08:25,193 --> 01:08:27,286
Some even said he was 'spirited away'.

638
01:08:27,429 --> 01:08:29,920
What's he to you?

639
01:08:30,498 --> 01:08:31,931
He was my brother.

640
01:08:36,137 --> 01:08:37,399
Brother?

641
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:43,204
I've got to go. Go away, will you?

642
01:08:43,345 --> 01:08:44,642
Dad!

643
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:59,854
Don't mind him. He hates people.

644
01:08:59,995 --> 01:09:03,396
No. I shouldn't have dropped in on him.

645
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,666
Aya, can I ask a favor?

646
01:09:07,802 --> 01:09:08,894
What?

647
01:09:11,873 --> 01:09:14,569
Will you lend me this?

648
01:09:16,311 --> 01:09:19,109
It's very unusual.
I'd like to copy it.

649
01:09:19,247 --> 01:09:20,271
That?

650
01:09:20,882 --> 01:09:26,343
I'll return it tomorrow.
I'm staying at Mr Kuroki's school.

651
01:09:26,855 --> 01:09:28,686
Sure. I'll come and get it.

652
01:09:28,823 --> 01:09:34,193
No, I'll bring it. I want to talk to
your father again.

653
01:09:36,731 --> 01:09:37,789
All right?

654
01:12:14,155 --> 01:12:19,593
Kozo Kenuma

655
01:13:25,627 --> 01:13:28,687
Nishihara!
This is divine retribution!

656
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:35,020
Wait!

657
01:14:36,731 --> 01:14:39,165
I passed you in the forest
above the cemetery.

658
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,460
What is it?

659
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:42,865
What do you want with my father?

660
01:14:43,004 --> 01:14:43,868
Nothing.

661
01:14:44,005 --> 01:14:46,200
You're lying!
Mr Kuroki told me!

662
01:14:46,307 --> 01:14:47,638
What?

663
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:52,371
You're after revenge for something!
Dad's been strange since yesterday.

664
01:14:52,513 --> 01:14:54,276
Oh.

665
01:14:57,085 --> 01:14:58,780
What are you going to do?

666
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,523
You don't remember Saburo.
who was here twenty years ago.

667
01:15:03,658 --> 01:15:06,718
Ask your father what he did to him!

668
01:15:07,428 --> 01:15:08,520
What did he do?!

669
01:15:08,663 --> 01:15:09,857
He killed him!

670
01:15:10,932 --> 01:15:13,264
Beat him to death!

671
01:15:13,601 --> 01:15:14,568
You're lying!

672
01:15:14,702 --> 01:15:17,899
Ask him, then. He remembers now.

673
01:15:19,173 --> 01:15:20,538
Murderer!

674
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:25,340
Come with me and see!

675
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:03,984
Here.

676
01:16:11,092 --> 01:16:13,117
Let's talk more.

677
01:16:13,428 --> 01:16:15,191
I won't sell my land.

678
01:16:15,329 --> 01:16:18,264
No... about the late Saburo.

679
01:16:18,599 --> 01:16:20,430
Don't know him.

680
01:16:20,568 --> 01:16:22,536
It's strange you'd forget.

681
01:16:23,371 --> 01:16:25,339
A boy you killed.

682
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:29,273
A slave, worth less than a cow
or a goat.

683
01:16:29,677 --> 01:16:32,202
You threw him in the sea.

684
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,313
Never heard of him.

685
01:16:34,515 --> 01:16:38,349
Oh yes, you do.
He sees you and he remembers.

686
01:16:39,086 --> 01:16:40,348
He does?

687
01:16:40,621 --> 01:16:43,181
Yes. I'm Saburo.

688
01:16:44,392 --> 01:16:47,657
Take a good look, old man.

689
01:16:48,463 --> 01:16:50,021
It's me!

690
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:56,559
Impossible.

691
01:16:57,572 --> 01:17:01,406
You're right. It is impossible.

692
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:05,304
But it's true. I'm Saburo.

693
01:17:06,547 --> 01:17:10,244
I'm the boy you killed
and threw in the sea.

694
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,077
Then tell me...

695
01:17:16,557 --> 01:17:21,995
...how a dead boy comes back to life
and talks to me.

696
01:17:22,129 --> 01:17:24,029
So I didn't kill you.

697
01:17:25,233 --> 01:17:30,000
Some fishermen from Miyake Island
found me floating.

698
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:37,335
Take a good look. It's me. Saburo.

699
01:17:38,012 --> 01:17:40,344
I don't know any Saburo.

700
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:48,421
I'm Sabo!

701
01:17:51,492 --> 01:17:55,519
I've changed, haven't I.
So have you.

702
01:17:56,531 --> 01:17:58,624
But some things don't change.

703
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:03,361
I never changed in wanting to
see you alive again.

704
01:18:06,607 --> 01:18:09,804
That's why I stayed alive!

705
01:18:09,944 --> 01:18:13,402
That's what kept me going
after I almost died here!

706
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:18,080
What do you want with me?

707
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,783
Aya... it was a monster that raised you.

708
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:24,953
What do you want?

709
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:30,657
Oh, I'm not finished yet.

710
01:18:31,566 --> 01:18:34,399
There's another man I came to see.

711
01:18:38,806 --> 01:18:42,742
Otake... you're Kozo Kenuma,
aren't you.

712
01:18:43,477 --> 01:18:46,878
Aya, that's your father's real name.

713
01:18:47,014 --> 01:18:48,743
You're Kenuma!

714
01:18:48,883 --> 01:18:51,351
No!

715
01:18:59,927 --> 01:19:01,986
I'Il make it simple.

716
01:19:03,331 --> 01:19:07,358
I took your fingerprints
from that Buddha's statue.

717
01:19:12,907 --> 01:19:15,307
They match.

718
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:20,979
You'd know better than anyone about
no two fingerprints being the same.

719
01:19:27,922 --> 01:19:33,383
It's a wonder your file was still intact.
And a wonder I found it.

720
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:36,492
It was a lot of work.

721
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:47,663
Someone told me you were Kenuma,
so I started looking for proof...

722
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:53,212
...that the Otake who killed me...

723
01:19:53,347 --> 01:19:57,977
...was the same military policeman
who killed my family!

724
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:08,394
My father was Genichiro Nishihara.

725
01:20:11,298 --> 01:20:13,391
Genichiro Nishihara?

726
01:20:13,634 --> 01:20:14,999
Yes.

727
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:20,497
The anarchist you killed
for the sake of your country.

728
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:25,400
You burst in and murdered my family.

729
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:34,785
Do I resemble the man you left
covered in blood in his library?

730
01:20:38,526 --> 01:20:46,991
To keep it quiet, the Army
and the Government sent you here.

731
01:20:47,935 --> 01:20:50,460
I was left an orphan.

732
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:55,635
How does a small boy
fend for himself?

733
01:20:58,045 --> 01:21:03,347
I got into trouble. I went from
reform school to reform school...

734
01:21:03,517 --> 01:21:05,712
...and ended up on the big island.

735
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:14,928
All the time I was trying
to escape from there...

736
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:18,790
...never guessing
you were right here!

737
01:21:20,568 --> 01:21:27,565
And now at last we meet again!
I'm delighted to find you alive!

738
01:21:29,577 --> 01:21:33,377
Mr Kenuma... I mean, Mr Otake...

739
01:21:36,217 --> 01:21:37,980
...I have to thank you.

740
01:21:39,386 --> 01:21:43,846
I wouldn't be who I am
if it hadn't been for you.

741
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:52,688
Dad! No!

742
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:54,698
Stop it!

743
01:21:54,835 --> 01:21:59,704
You don't know what it's like
to spend your life in exile!

744
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:03,574
No, I guess I don't.

745
01:22:04,345 --> 01:22:06,643
But do you understand how I feel?

746
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:10,608
You can't erase your fingerprints.

747
01:22:23,764 --> 01:22:27,666
Move... stand aside.

748
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:34,833
You'll have to kill me first.

749
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:38,039
I'll kill you!

750
01:22:38,445 --> 01:22:39,469
Stop that.

751
01:22:40,648 --> 01:22:47,349
If you'd been older, you'd have
defended your father with your life!

752
01:23:14,281 --> 01:23:15,578
Move!

753
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,918
Move, I said!

754
01:23:20,154 --> 01:23:21,644
I won't kill him.

755
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:33,456
Otake... Kenuma...

756
01:23:39,273 --> 01:23:42,140
I'll take the finger.

757
01:23:43,777 --> 01:23:45,972
The one whose print I took.

758
01:23:48,015 --> 01:23:52,213
Cut off your thumb. That'll do.

759
01:23:57,658 --> 01:23:58,682
Cut it off!

760
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:23,194
THE END
