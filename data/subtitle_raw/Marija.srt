1
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,071
150 euros per week, each of you.
- Yes.

2
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,999
Get in.

3
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,279
One week, 150 euros.
OK?

4
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,790
If you need me, I'm downstairs at Mehmet's.

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,355
Don't take anyone into the flat!

6
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,236
What will happen in 6 months?
- I'll let you know.

7
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,195
<i>Mama.</i>

8
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,550
What?
- Do you have a pen?

9
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,870
Yes.

10
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,878
Here's your pen back.

11
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,111
Just keep it.
- No, no, please.

12
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,113
Mrs Vitrychenko?

13
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,470
I thought, you liked your work here.

14
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,074
What?

15
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,796
Don't pretend you don't know!

16
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,829
They're mine!

17
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,037
Shall we call the police then?

18
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,509
Give me your badge and the keys for your locker.

19
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,269
Now!

20
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,677
Thanks, we'll catch up on Monday.

21
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Yes.

22
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,309
Bitch!

23
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,639
Excuse me, do you work here?

24
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,354
I'm sorry, we're fully booked until next week.

25
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,436
Is there another hairdresser nearby?

26
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,155
Up there at the corner
I think it's a men's salon though.

27
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,158
Good question.

28
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,716
I think there's one at the station.

29
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,509
Thanks.

30
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,471
What were you thinking?

31
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,593
They're not stupid!

32
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,154
And I'm the stupid one?

33
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,357
Of course I thought it through.

34
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,760
Cleaning schedules change daily,
they wouldn't have caught me.

35
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,713
But they did.

36
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,915
It was Amina.
- Who?

37
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,475
Amina.
- The gipsy?

38
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,149
The Turkish girl.

39
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,073
You believe everything.

40
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,832
What?
- You believe everything they tell you.

41
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,638
Can you lend me something
until the end of the month?

42
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,678
At least you had a job!

43
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,755
Try and save something earning 4 euros per hour.

44
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,840
Forget your hair salon and look for normal work.

45
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,274
1500 and I'll paint the place myself.

46
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,994
Forget it.

47
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,716
You haven't done anything to it.

48
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,872
Do you think, you're the only one interested?

49
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,959
1800, with the counter and glass-cabinet.

50
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,914
OK.
- Good!

51
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,517
See you at the end of the month!

52
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,959
What is this?!

53
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,520
Finally!
- What do you think you're doing!

54
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,392
I came here three times last week.

55
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,834
Where were you?!

56
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,875
I was working.
Late shifts.

57
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,117
I don't give a shit.
Pay me the rent!

58
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,439
Listen carefully.
Today is the fourth!

59
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,234
I normally kick people out on the third.

60
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,878
What's the matter with you?

61
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,239
What's the matter?

62
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,712
It doesn't look like you did much work last week.

63
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,471
If you need work, let me know.

64
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,995
Fill up your fridge properly!

65
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,230
He needs a doctor.
Something with his foot.

66
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,715
OK.

67
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,596
Seventy.
- Seventy?!

68
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,551
You wanted a job, didn't you?

69
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,680
That's all he has.

70
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,309
50 now and 20 after the treatment.

71
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,711
Doctor Weiler in Schillerstrasse.

72
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,913
Right next to the pharmacy.

73
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,839
He treats people without insurance card.

74
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,194
They were great.

75
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,635
I won't need them again next week.
The job's finished.

76
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,314
Your assistant?

77
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,439
She isn't Bulgarian, is she?

78
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,349
Ukrainian.

79
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,836
Here's something extra for them.

80
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,320
But give it to them!

81
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,677
Will I see you at Henkel's next week?

82
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,599
Come on!
It's gonna be fun.

83
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,555
I wouldn't miss the food
at the 'Golden Heron' if I were you.

84
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,436
The Golden Heron, don't you know it?

85
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,795
Sure.

86
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,957
See you next week.

87
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
Go on!

88
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,796
I only sing in front of a large audience.

89
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,875
Show me your bathroom.

90
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,355
I'm cooking.

91
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,678
You want it fixed, right?

92
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,555
At last!

93
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,950
At last?!

94
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,513
There are flats here
where you can't even have a shit!

95
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,355
What do you want?

96
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,955
Smells good.

97
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,152
Do you know the Golden Heron?

98
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,754
Nice place.

99
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,679
Friend of mine is celebrating
his firm's anniversary next week.

100
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,639
Henkel Real Estate.

101
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,873
A big shot in Dortmund.

102
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,915
Wouldn't you love to go for a nice meal?

103
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,554
Fifty.

104
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
OK?

105
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,714
Seventy, not more.

106
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,714
I don't even have anything nice to wear.

107
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,839
I'll send someone to fix your bathroom next week.

108
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,469
For how long has he had the fever?

109
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,994
Five days.

110
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,716
Why did you wait so long to come?

111
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,759
I'll have a look.

112
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,476
Please open your trousers,
I need to feel the glands.

113
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,957
I'll have to send you to a hospital.

114
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,479
Blood poisoning. Sepsis.

115
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,838
He says, medicine will be fine.

116
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,716
If I let him go now,
he'll be back to work in a few days.

117
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,758
I know you want to work.

118
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,470
You're not the first to come here like this.

119
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,638
If we don't treat it properly,

120
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,956
they'll be removing your foot in a week.

121
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,310
He says, he can't afford the hospital.

122
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,353
He would need medication.

123
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,634
I can only let him go, if I can rely on you 100%.

124
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
OK?

125
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,480
Good.

126
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,954
Thanks, Marija.

127
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,432
Let me go in here.

128
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,793
Here, your 20 euros.

129
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,159
What shall I tell my wife and children?

130
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,354
Sorry.

131
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,557
How can I go back without anything?

132
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,956
I'm sure there will be work in summer.

133
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,315
Sorry.

134
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,911
Thanks.

135
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,550
It tastes nice.

136
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,474
Drink it straight away.

137
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,917
How are you, my brother?

138
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,077
Thanks. And you?

139
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,272
Fine.

140
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,719
Marija, Hassan.
- Hello.

141
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,349
And?

142
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,479
I'm doing great.
And you? What's up?

143
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,274
I haven't seen you for a while.
What have you been up to?

144
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,517
I work at the stock exchange now.

145
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,351
Excuse me.
Would you have a cigarette for me?

146
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,315
Thanks.

147
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,073
Menthol not many smoke these!

148
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,599
Silk or polyester?
Your dress.

149
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,475
It's obvious.

150
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,911
I would have preferred polyester.

151
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,469
Why?

152
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,718
Then I'd know you bought the dress yourself.

153
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,074
Very generous.

154
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,279
What is he paying you to accompany him?

155
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,712
You put on a good show but I know Cem.

156
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,432
You're from the Ukraine, right?

157
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,116
They speak Russian down there, don't they?

158
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,549
Ukrainian

159
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,840
and Russian.

160
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,919
I'm currently negotiating with a Russian client,

161
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,316
and need someone, who could translate for me.

162
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,393
15 euros per hour.

163
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,869
That's not even enough for a polyester dress.

164
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,118
No, but enough to buy your own cigarettes.

165
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,793
Call me...

166
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,955
Cem.

167
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,200
I thought you didn't smoke?
- Sometimes.

168
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,437
Unfortunately, I can't offer you one.

169
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,711
I had to ask for one myself

170
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,514
I'll go back in.

171
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,074
What did I tell you?

172
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,834
Don't hang the washing outside!

173
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,957
No washing, do you understand?!

174
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,359
How many children do you want to register?
- Three.

175
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,749
300 euros.

176
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,039
For three applications?!

177
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,953
You need money, don't you?

178
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,640
100 euros to get child benefit.

179
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,191
100 euros for one child.
Three children, 300 euros.

180
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,149
100 euros for the three of them.

181
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,239
300 euros or you can forget
your child benefit. OK?

182
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,435
What does he say?

183
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,876
He understood:
100 euros for the three of them.

184
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,350
You know what?
Learn some German first.

185
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,153
OK?
Let's go.

186
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,753
Please wait!

187
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,239
He needs the child benefit.

188
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,075
300 euros. OK?
- OK.

189
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,155
If you don't screw them, they'll screw you.

190
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,595
Believe me.

191
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,717
You see!
I told you.

192
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,678
DE 1, 2

193
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,518
3, 4

194
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,989
5, 3

195
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,159
Let me see.
- Yes.

196
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,914
The first child. Name?
- Martha.

197
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,791
Date of birth?
- The passports.

198
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,990
Now, first you do a test.

199
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,912
Marija, say something.

200
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,709
I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry.

201
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,115
You'll be the best mother;
one can imagine.

202
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,232
Why did you ask me to get a test,
if you've done one already?

203
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,637
If I'm pregnant, I want to be sure.

204
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,389
You never know with these tests!

205
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,393
13 euros!
- Yes.

206
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,118
I could have bought you some nappies instead.

207
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,678
Or some pregnancy tea.
- I'll make us some tea.

208
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,078
Thanks again.
- Just put them there.

209
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,039
Who did you go out with?

210
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,112
Cem.
- Who's that?

211
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,591
Cem, my landlord.

212
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,434
Your landlord?

213
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,954
Tell me...

214
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,191
Is it something serious?

215
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,794
I'm pregnant.

216
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,439
What do you think?!

217
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,071
Come on, tell me!

218
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,874
I'm saving my rent.

219
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,036
See, there are three companies left.

220
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,797
Last time they were busy comparing the offers.

221
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,351
If I'm too high, I won't get the job.

222
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,875
If I'm too low, I won't be earning anything.

223
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,150
So you keep me in the loop.

224
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
OK?

225
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,320
No thanks.

226
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,550
Why didn't you call me sooner?

227
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,554
Why didn't you hire an interpreter?

228
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,153
You ask me that?

229
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,640
Sounds more like a question Cem would ask.

230
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,190
So you no longer like my fags?

231
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,320
What?

232
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,275
If you no longer like my cigarettes.

233
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,111
I think, I need an interpreter.

234
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,394
I think you do.

235
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,033
His offer for the facade is now 10% cheaper.

236
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,990
Would it change the overall price?
- All in all it's about the same.

237
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,878
Will it be worth it?

238
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,109
It will be worth it.
- I don't know.

239
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,113
Where is this idiot?

240
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,553
Your offer is fine.

241
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,439
So, you're not from Germany?

242
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,671
No, Hungary.

243
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,269
Hungary!

244
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,509
Not bad!
Where did you learn Hungarian?

245
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,310
Old story, long time ago.
Beautiful woman.

246
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,716
19 percent?
- Yes.

247
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,912
We'll check your offer and let you know.

248
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,070
Let's fix a date now.

249
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,915
Bockwurst.

250
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,120
Your wife?

251
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,351
My assistant.

252
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,720
Next time, bring more assistants.
OK?

253
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,716
What did they talk about at the end?

254
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,355
Borisov said, you're a fly,
that buzzes more than it flies.

255
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,799
We'll see who the fly is, Russian cunts.

256
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,151
It's just an expression.

257
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,351
They also talked about who gets to fuck me first.

258
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,920
And?

259
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,195
Tell me Marija...

260
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,558
do you have a girlfriend,
you could bring along on Friday?

261
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,034
If we get the job I'll pay you double.

262
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,753
So you like my dress?

263
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,275
Coffee?

264
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,831
What does a week in Antalya cost?

265
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,918
All inclusive, two people.

266
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,074
<i>500..., 600.</i>

267
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,831
Over Easter would be good.

268
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,429
What do you think?

269
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,114
Thanks.

270
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,158
That's what I earn.
- Well.

271
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,833
Why don't you look for a normal job?

272
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,759
Because I don't want to be exploited anymore.

273
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,869
That's not what I came here for.

274
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,398
Are you hungry?

275
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,112
Not at the moment, thanks.
Just put it down.

276
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,757
If we get the job, Georg will need men.

277
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,155
And

278
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,839
Igor would have work for at least six months!

279
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,117
Is he like Cem?

280
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,519
Georg is alright.

281
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,595
Trust me.

282
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,429
You'd better focus on your hair salon,

283
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,039
instead of getting involved with guys like him.

284
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,912
I know. That's why!

285
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,119
Have some water.

286
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,909
I feel as if I was drunk.

287
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,318
Do you have a tissue?

288
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,559
We're almost done here.
- I hope so.

289
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,834
There's some lipstick in my bag.

290
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,472
If the payment's on time,

291
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,597
I don't see a problem.

292
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,919
He says, if we pay as agreed,
there won't be any problems.

293
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,436
He's worried about his money.
Does he know who I am?

294
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,269
I don't know.

295
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,837
Tell him: 'Trust is like virginity,

296
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,350
once it's lost, it's over'.

297
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,197
Do you want me to translate that?

298
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,914
Is 'virginity' so hard to translate?

299
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,477
Don't play with our trust.

300
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,751
The feeling is mutual.

301
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,993
He says, it also depends on us.

302
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,999
Has he understood?
- He agrees.

303
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,357
Tell him I will send him the contract tomorrow.

304
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,231
We'll send you the finalized contract tomorrow.

305
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,310
Just let him pay.

306
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,200
Let's join them?

307
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,710
See you soon.

308
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,716
It was nice to meet you.

309
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:13,790
Too bad we could only speak English.

310
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,159
Tell Olga, she can send
her boyfriend over next week.

311
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,198
How do you know each other?

312
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,118
We studied together.

313
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,074
Studied?

314
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,798
Did you tell that to Cem too?

315
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,911
Of course.
- Did he believe you?

316
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,877
How long were you in prison?

317
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,834
Ten months.
- Not bad.

318
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,036
It is worse once you're out.

319
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,916
You've served your time, but you pay for it

320
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,152
much later.

321
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,838
No business left, no phone calls,

322
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,753
not even a beer with a friend.

323
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,790
The important thing is to get back on your feet.

324
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,117
I'll be out of debt!

325
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,116
And that's also thanks to you.

326
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,798
Would you like to become my assistant?

327
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,473
400 euros per week.

328
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,598
If I don't have to run around in a miniskirt!

329
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,918
Same again, please!

330
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,797
What was your job here?

331
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,153
I was cleaning.

332
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,512
There's nothing wrong with that.
- That's what you say.

333
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,430
You mean, if they'd at least
hit the toilet when they take a shit?

334
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,870
You get used to cleaning.

335
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,873
And afterwards they grab your tits?

336
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,840
As a cleaner they don't even look at you.

337
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,551
I promised myself never to come back
to this fucking place.

338
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,675
At least you're here as a guest today.

339
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,880
And

340
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,712
some day you'll have your salon.

341
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,638
I'm sure of it.

342
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,596
Even without a university degree.

343
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,915
The key card doesn't work.
- Wrong door

344
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,638
56.
- Exactly.

345
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,552
You said 653.

346
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,518
Sure?

347
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,515
I thought it was 56.
- Wrong door.

348
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,675
Will you take me to my room?

349
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,391
And, is it worth it?

350
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,753
It must have fallen out of your pocket.
- So what?

351
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,272
If I were you I would have taken it.

352
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,832
Come on, stay here.

353
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,599
I don't want that.

354
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,430
But I'm not trying to buy you.

355
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,474
See you tomorrow.

356
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,552
Where were you?
- I found a job.

357
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,398
Just tell me, if you need a job!

358
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,759
You go down there!

359
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,274
Where did you find work?

360
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,157
Stacking shelves.
- Where?

361
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,994
At the supermarket.
- Money is shit there!

362
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,396
Do you have your men?
Shut the door!

363
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,989
Monastir.

364
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,872
You probably don't know where that is.

365
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,872
25 degrees in the shade!

366
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,712
Tunisia.
It was even cheaper than Antalya!

367
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,070
What's the matter?

368
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,600
Nothing.

369
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,838
Why don't you pick it up?

370
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,838
My battery is almost dead.

371
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,113
It's gonna be nice!

372
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,357
I think I'll have to work over Easter.

373
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,791
You don't have to work over Easter.

374
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,752
Good.
- The crabs were lovely.

375
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,115
Thank you.

376
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,035
See you soon.

377
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,040
Holy shit, they drink the stuff like water!

378
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,959
Do you want me to drive?

379
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,833
Just keep hold of the bag,

380
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,276
in case I hit a tree.

381
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,880
Can I take a look inside?

382
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,999
Keep your hands off!

383
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,033
Keep it, it's a present.

384
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,279
It's for you.

385
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,477
I don't want any presents.

386
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,799
OK, give it back.

387
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,718
I earned it.

388
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,915
What's the matter?

389
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,193
Nothing. Thanks.

390
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,114
What would you like to drink?

391
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,200
I'll invite you.

392
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,358
Two gin and tonics.

393
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,994
Where are you from?

394
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,554
France.

395
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,593
That's what I thought.

396
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,040
Yeah?

397
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,232
The most beautiful girls are always from France.

398
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,436
And sometimes from the east.

399
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,952
You hardly have an accent.

400
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,352
How much do you want?

401
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,515
Nice shirt.

402
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,553
The guy over there kindly paid for these.

403
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,470
You don't let anyone off easily, I like that.

404
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,150
Really.

405
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,036
You only say this, because you're drunk.

406
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,472
No, I really mean it.

407
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,475
Really.

408
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,153
Let's dance.

409
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,671
You can barely stand!

410
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,757
Why are you laughing?

411
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,634
Look at yourself.

412
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,355
Better?

413
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,235
As usual.

414
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,195
Sorry.

415
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,193
Oh, man!

416
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,509
Does your salon have an name yet?

417
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,793
Good question.

418
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,951
You should think of one.

419
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,951
You talked to the landlord?

420
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,430
Don't worry, we're friends.

421
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,438
What are you doing here?

422
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,155
We said by the end of the month.

423
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,195
I get it!
Fuck off.

424
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,158
What was that about?

425
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:42,031
You didn't look like you had the money.

426
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,719
Call him!

427
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,919
I've got it!
Just now, yes.

428
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,559
See you in a minute.

429
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,515
Thanks.

430
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,954
I hope you'll have more luck with it than I did.

431
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,077
What are you waiting for?

432
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,233
We have to get going!

433
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,400
What's the matter?

434
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,669
Give me the keys!

435
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,159
Give me the keys, I said.

436
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,159
Who do you think you are!

437
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,993
You think, you can take the piss?

438
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,310
Let go!

439
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,153
What's this?

440
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,951
Does he fuck as well as he pays?

441
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,834
Get the fuck out of here.

442
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,315
OK?

443
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,758
You fucking whore!

444
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,029
I get you a job, let you stay for free and you.

445
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,795
You let this bastard fuck you in the ass!

446
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,314
You cunt!

447
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,030
Don't dare to comeback.

448
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,277
I'll fuck you!

449
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,553
You, and your whole family!

450
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,359
Go to Depot 1.

451
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,320
Hi Igor.

452
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,715
<i>Mama.</i>

453
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,557
Is Georg around?

454
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,915
Georg is at the office.

455
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:27,152
Why?
- I need to talk to him.

456
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:29,360
I'm coming.

457
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,392
I'll tell him, OK?

458
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,518
OK, thanks!

459
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,200
Hello.

460
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,033
I need a signature.

461
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,478
And where should I take it?

462
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,199
To Depot 2.

463
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,949
Inspection!

464
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,515
Inspection!

465
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,998
He's not at home
and he doesn't pick up his mobile.

466
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,396
I'm sure Igor managed to get away.

467
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,513
Can I use your mobile?

468
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,116
Forget it!
- I'm trying to reach Georg.

469
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,634
He doesn't pick up either.

470
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,036
There are still some people here.

471
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,479
The police has gone.

472
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,510
Let's ask the guy over there.

473
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,677
Hello.
Have you seen Igor?

474
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,038
Have you seen Igor?

475
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,520
Igor?

476
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,150
What's the matter?
- I feel sick.

477
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,792
Turn round, please!

478
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,120
How are you?

479
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,439
I'm glad you came.

480
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,793
You look tired.

481
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,077
I don't sleep well here.

482
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,036
They'll let you out soon won't they?

483
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,158
They've caught Igor.

484
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,720
Who?

485
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,712
Igor, Olga's boyfriend.

486
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,871
He can count on his money, right?

487
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,469
What money?

488
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,114
From my blocked bank account?

489
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,079
What about Borisov's money?

490
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,990
Either I'll tell them everything
or they'll lock me up again.

491
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,472
But you're not going to.
- Yes!

492
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,673
Everything!

493
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,911
There will be no company anymore.

494
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,840
But I won't go back inside.
Not again.

495
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,950
Hand over the money to my lawyer.

496
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,719
He knows what to do.

497
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,235
How is he?

498
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,630
He's staying with friends in Oleksandrivka.

499
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,919
What did Georg say?

500
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,518
Don't worry.
He promised it to me.

501
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:55,909
He promised ...!?

502
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,512
Did he at least pay you?

503
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,876
He's in jail.
What can he do?

504
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:05,112
'What can he do'. Stop speaking German!

505
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,713
Don't you understand?

506
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,838
It sounds stupid.

507
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,599
Mrs Vitrychenko.

508
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,759
Here is your contract.

509
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,676
Take it home and study it.

510
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,230
Then sign it and bring it back.

511
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,077
I won't be able

512
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,710
to start refurbishing next month.

513
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,636
I don't care, when you start refurbishing.

514
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,717
Would it be possible

515
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,797
to start the contract in three of four months?

516
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,676
I could pay the deposit now.

517
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:03,397
I want the deposit and the rent next week.

518
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,716
Or forget about it.

519
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,753
It was just a question.

520
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,872
And this was just my answer.

521
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,514
Thanks a lot.

522
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,390
Goodbye.

523
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:42,989
And?

524
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:44,755
What?

525
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,389
Did you give the money to my lawyer?

526
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,511
Leave it! They won't be able
to prove anything.

527
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,717
Marija, this is important!

528
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,840
But you need the money.

529
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,474
I want to get things straight.
I need to get out!

530
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:00,915
Do you understand?

531
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,114
What about Igor?

532
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,957
I don't give a fuck about Igor.

533
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,914
I need to pay my first rent next week.

534
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,509
Forget about your damn salon.

535
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,712
My aunt's husband
has a real estate firm in Mallorca.

536
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:35,912
When I get out, I can maybe work for him.

537
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,949
I can't show my face round here again.

538
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:52,949
What about me?

539
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,317
You're going to come with me.

540
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,479
What will I do there?

541
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,631
We'll find something for you.

542
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,959
Coffee?

543
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,352
Igor?
- Can you hear me?

544
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,520
Yes.

545
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,158
Have you been to the doctor?
- Yes.

546
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,873
What did he say?

547
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,640
There's no need to worry until the eighth month.

548
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:05,877
Good.
By then you should be here!

549
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,954
Igor, can you hear me?

550
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,877
I'll call you back later, OK?

551
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,198
Kisses, my darling.

552
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,558
How long will you be away?

553
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,554
I'm going to stay.

554
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:32,756
What do you think?!
That Igor can just jump on a plane back?

555
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,156
We promised ourselves never to go back!

556
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,197
Do you think, I have a choice?

557
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:50,433
And what will you do there?

558
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,958
If it was Georg you would leave too!

559
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,549
I don't know.

560
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,758
You don't know?

561
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,197
We're having a baby.

562
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,676
I don't understand, how you can

563
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,632
throw you whole life away for a guy.

564
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,797
Because I love him!

565
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,109
We have to ask where the bus leaves from.

566
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,277
Georg gave it to me for you.

567
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:35,993
You will need it.

568
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,830
Aren't you happy?
- Yes, I am.

569
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,438
I just didn't expect it.

570
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,355
Thanks.

571
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,113
I'll let him know.

572
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,637
Don't lie to me.

573
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,472
He isn't worth it.

574
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,436
I never liked him.

575
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:03,960
Shut up!

576
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,511
Excuse me, do you have alight?

577
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,029
Thanks.

578
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,869
You're out?

579
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,270
Yes, my father bailed me out.

580
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,711
Are you out of your mind?

581
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,429
For a shitty place like this?!

582
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,074
I didn't work for free.

583
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:10,833
Are you crazy!

584
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,749
Don't touch me.

585
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,599
I've kept the rest of the money.
It's here.

586
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,992
Do you think,
they'll ever believe another word I say?

587
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,878
Do you know, what this will mean for me?!

588
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,157
Thanks.

589
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,519
I thought, there was something between us.

590
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,595
No.

591
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,678
Don't lie to me!

592
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:25,760
Leave!

593
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:29,549
What?

594
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,713
Take your money and leave.

595
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,959
Say that again.

596
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,229
Look into my eyes and say it again!

597
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:43,795
Leave!

598
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,395
You can stuff the money up your ass.

599
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,998
Hello.
- Hello.

600
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,712
Is Georg at home?

601
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,400
Gone.

602
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,437
Can I talk to him?

603
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,154
He's gone.

604
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,433
I need to give him something.

605
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,676
When he's back, I'll give it to him.

606
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,158
So he's coming back?

607
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,039
No idea.

608
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,634
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

609
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:36,071
I'm glad you could take me
without an appointment!

610
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,590
Do you live nearby?
- No, no.

611
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:43,910
But a relative of mine,
owns the restaurant at the corner.

612
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,719
You know, which one I mean?
- Yes, the Turk.

613
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,275
Kurd!
- The Kurd.

614
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,996
Are you Kurdish?
- Yes.

615
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,599
Hello.

616
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,120
Hello.

617
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,353
There are no bin bags left.

618
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:09,154
I used to work in a Kurdish restaurant.

619
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:11,600
At Lasan's.

620
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,317
I've never heard of it.

621
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,672
It wasn't doing very well.

622
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,837
I don't even know, if it still exists.

623
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,715
My brother-in-law
is doing very well.

624
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:26,071
He even wants to open a second restaurant.

625
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,634
Really? Nice.

626
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,510
It must have been difficult
to find something nice around here.

627
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,471
You've been very lucky!

628
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,515
Would you like something to drink?
Water?

629
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,355
A coffee.

630
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,194
Thank you.

631
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:22,753
And what do you do?

632
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:26,189
My husband and I own a small tailor shop.

633
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:31,236
Here in Nordstadt?
- Yes, right at the Nordmarkt.

634
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,354
Great.
